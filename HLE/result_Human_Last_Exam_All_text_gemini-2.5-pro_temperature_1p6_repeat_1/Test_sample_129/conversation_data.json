    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of true boolean expressions that can be written using exactly 5 of the given symbols.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Problem\n*   **Expression Length:** Must be exactly 5 symbols.\n*   **Allowed Symbols:** `T` (True), `F` (False), `!` (NOT), `&` (AND), `|` (OR), `(`, `)`.\n*   **Symbol Repetition:** Allowed.\n*   **Operator Precedence:** `!` has the highest precedence, then `&`, then `|`.\n*   **Goal:** Count the number of syntactically valid expressions of length 5 that evaluate to `True`.\n\n### 2. Strategy: Pattern Enumeration\nThe most reliable method is to identify all possible valid structures (patterns) for a 5-symbol expression string, ensure these patterns are mutually exclusive (i.e., no string fits more than one pattern), and then for each pattern, count how many combinations of variables (`T`/`F`) and operators (`&`/`|`) result in a `True` value.\n\nLet `V` represent a variable (`T` or `F`) and `B` represent a binary operator (`&` or `|`).\n\n### 3. Identifying and Analyzing Valid 5-Symbol Patterns\n\n**Pattern 1: `V B V B V`** (e.g., `T & F | T`)\n*   This pattern has no parentheses and no `!` operators. The structure is unique.\n*   There are 2 choices for each of the 3 `V`s and 2 choices for each of the 2 `B`s. Total strings: 2³ * 2² = 32.\n*   Evaluation depends on the operators and precedence (`&` before `|`).\n    *   `A & B & C` (evaluates as `(A&B)&C`): True only for `T&T&T`. (1 true case)\n    *   `A & B | C` (evaluates as `(A&B)|C`): True if `C` is True (4 cases for A,B), or if `C` is False and `A&B` is True (1 case: `T&T&F`). Total: 4 + 1 = 5 true cases.\n    *   `A | B & C` (evaluates as `A|(B&C)`): Symmetric to the above. 5 true cases.\n    *   `A | B | C` (evaluates as `(A|B)|C`): True unless all are False (`F|F|F`). Total cases are 2³=8, so 8-1=7 true cases.\n*   **Count for Pattern 1:** 1 + 5 + 5 + 7 = **18**\n\n**Pattern 2: `( V B V )`** (e.g., `(T & T)`)\n*   `A & B` is true only for `T&T`. (1 true case).\n*   `A | B` is true for `T|T`, `T|F`, `F|T`. (3 true cases).\n*   **Count for Pattern 2:** 1 + 3 = **4**\n\n**Pattern 3: `! ( V B V )`** (e.g., `!(F | F)`)\n*   The expression is true if the inner part `(V B V)` is false.\n*   `A & B` is false for `T&F`, `F&T`, `F&F`. (3 false cases).\n*   `A | B` is false only for `F|F`. (1 false case).\n*   **Count for Pattern 3:** 3 + 1 = **4**\n\n**Pattern 4: `! V B ! V`** (e.g., `!F & !F`)\n*   Evaluates as `(!A) B (!B)`.\n*   `!A & !B` is true only if `A=F` and `B=F`. (1 true case).\n*   `!A | !B` is true unless `A=T` and `B=T`. (3 true cases).\n*   **Count for Pattern 4:** 1 + 3 = **4**\n\n**Pattern 5: `! ! V B V`** (e.g., `!!T & T`)\n*   Evaluates as `(!!A) B B`, which is equivalent to `A B B`.\n*   This is the same logic as Pattern 2.\n*   **Count for Pattern 5:** 1 + 3 = **4**\n\n**Pattern 6: `V B ! ! V`** (e.g., `T & !!T`)\n*   Evaluates as `A B (!!B)`, which is equivalent to `A B B`.\n*   **Count for Pattern 6:** 1 + 3 = **4**\n\n**Pattern 7: `! ! ! ! V`** (e.g., `!!!!T`)\n*   `!!!!T` evaluates to `!!!F` -> `!!T` -> `!F` -> `T`. (True)\n*   `!!!!F` evaluates to `!!!T` -> `!!F` -> `!T` -> `F`. (False)\n*   **Count for Pattern 7:** **1**\n\n**Pattern 8: `V B ( V )`** (e.g., `T & (T)`)\n*   Evaluates as `A B B`.\n*   **Count for Pattern 8:** 1 + 3 = **4**\n\n**Pattern 9: `( V ) B V`** (e.g., `(T) & T`)\n*   Evaluates as `A B B`.\n*   **Count for Pattern 9:** 1 + 3 = **4**\n\n**Pattern 10: `! ! ( V )`** (e.g., `!!(T)`)\n*   Length: `! ! ( V )` -> 5 symbols.\n*   `!!(T)` evaluates to `!F` -> `T`. (True)\n*   `!!(F)` evaluates to `!T` -> `F`. (False)\n*   **Count for Pattern 10:** **1**\n\n**Pattern 11: `( ! ! V )`** (e.g., `(!!T)`)\n*   Length: `( ! ! V )` -> 5 symbols.\n*   `(!!T)` evaluates to `(T)` -> `T`. (True)\n*   `(!!F)` evaluates to `(F)` -> `F`. (False)\n*   **Count for Pattern 11:** **1**\n\n**Pattern 12: `( ( V ) )`** (e.g., `((T))`)\n*   Length: `( ( V ) )` -> 5 symbols.\n*   `((T))` evaluates to `T`. (True)\n*   `((F))` evaluates to `F`. (False)\n*   **Count for Pattern 12:** **1**\n\nNote: Other potential patterns like `(V B !V)` are 6 symbols long, `( V & ! F )`, and are thus invalid.\n\n### 4. Final Calculation\nThe patterns identified are structurally unique as strings, so we can sum their counts without double-counting.\n\n*   Pattern 1: 18\n*   Pattern 2: 4\n*   Pattern 3: 4\n*   Pattern 4: 4\n*   Pattern 5: 4\n*   Pattern 6: 4\n*   Pattern 7: 1\n*   Pattern 8: 4\n*   Pattern 9: 4\n*   Pattern 10: 1\n*   Pattern 11: 1\n*   Pattern 12: 1\n\nTotal = 18 + (4 × 7) + (1 × 4) = 18 + 28 + 4 = 50.\n\nThere are 50 distinct true boolean expressions of exactly 5 symbols.\n\n<<<50>>>"
