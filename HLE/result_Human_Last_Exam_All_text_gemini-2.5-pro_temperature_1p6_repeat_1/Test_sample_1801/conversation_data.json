    "**Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The core components of the question are:\n    *   **Who:** Two Nobel laureates.\n    *   **What:** They were featured in a commercial.\n    *   **For whom:** Enron.\n    *   **When:** In the year 2000.\n    *   **Key Detail:** The commercial's tagline was \"Ask Why.\"\n    *   **Context:** The commercial is described as \"infamous,\" which points to the irony of Enron promoting intellectual honesty and questioning, just before its massive collapse due to accounting fraud in 2001.\n\n2.  **Identify the \"Ask Why\" Campaign:** The Enron \"Ask Why\" campaign was a major branding effort in 2000. The goal was to portray Enron not as a stodgy energy company, but as an innovative, forward-thinking firm at the forefront of the new economy. To do this, they featured various thought leaders in their commercials.\n\n3.  **Identify the Nobel Laureates:** Research into this specific ad campaign reveals the two individuals who fit the description.\n    *   **Person 1: Myron Scholes.**\n        *   He is a Nobel laureate, having won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 1997 along with Robert C. Merton for the Black-Scholes options pricing model.\n        *   At the time of the 2000 commercial, he was already a Nobel laureate.\n        *   His involvement is particularly infamous because he was also a partner at the hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM), which spectacularly collapsed in 1998, requiring a massive Federal Reserve-led bailout. His association with two major financial disasters is a point of significant irony.\n    *   **Person 2: Paul Krugman.**\n        *   He is a Nobel laureate, having won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 2008 for his analysis of trade patterns and the location of economic activity.\n        *   He appeared in the 2000 Enron commercial.\n        *   A crucial point to be careful about: At the time the commercial aired, Krugman was a prominent economist but had *not yet* won the Nobel Prize. He won it eight years later. However, the question asks which two \"Nobel laureates\" were featured, and he is now a Nobel laureate, so he fits the criteria. He has since publicly expressed regret for his participation in the ad campaign.\n\n**List of Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Timing of the Nobel Prizes:** One individual (Myron Scholes) was already a Nobel laureate when the commercial aired, while the other (Paul Krugman) became a laureate years later. This is a common point of confusion but doesn't change the answer to the question as it is phrased.\n*   **The \"Infamous\" Nature:** The infamy stems directly from the dramatic contrast between the commercial's message of transparency and intellectual curiosity (\"Ask Why\") and the reality of Enron's massive, systemic fraud that was soon to be revealed.\n*   **Irony of Association:** The involvement of respected economists, particularly one (Scholes) who was already associated with a major financial collapse (LTCM), added a deep layer of irony to the campaign in retrospect.\n\n**Final Answer Acquisition:**\n\nBy combining the research on the Enron \"Ask Why\" campaign with the biographies of the individuals involved, we can definitively identify the two Nobel laureates as Myron Scholes and Paul Krugman.\n\n<<<Paul Krugman and Myron Scholes>>>"
