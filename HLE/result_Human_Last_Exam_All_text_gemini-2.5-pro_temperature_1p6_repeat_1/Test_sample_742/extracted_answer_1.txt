No, it is not possible. The two systems are fundamentally incommensurable. Quantum mechanics is a physical theory describing the behavior of the universe, while Gödel's proof is a metaphysical argument in formal logic. The core concepts of Gödel's proof, such as "positive property" and metaphysical "necessity," have no meaningful or non-arbitrary equivalent within the mathematical formalism of quantum mechanics (Hilbert spaces, operators, etc.). Therefore, the mathematical tools of quantum mechanics cannot be used to prove or disprove a conclusion derived from a completely separate logical and conceptual framework.
