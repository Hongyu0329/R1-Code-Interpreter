    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The core of the question is to identify a specific character within a specific book who performs a specific action.\n    *   **Book:** *The House of the Wolfings* by William Morris.\n    *   **Character:** A named individual from the story.\n    *   **Action 1:** This character must have visited a Roman city.\n    *   **Action 2:** This character describes Roman religious practices.\n    *   **Key Detail:** The description must contain an allusion to the myth of Romulus and Remus (founders of Rome, suckled by a she-wolf) that is recognizable to the reader, even if the character describes it from their own cultural perspective.\n\n2.  **Identify Potential Characters and Context:** The novel is about the Goths (the Wolfings) preparing to fight the invading Romans. Therefore, any character who has had direct contact with Roman civilization is a candidate. This contact could be as a warrior, a captive, or a traveler. The most likely character to have spent significant time in a Roman city against their will would be a former captive.\n\n3.  **Scan for Relevant Characters:** Reviewing the characters in *The House of the Wolfings*, we find a thrall (a person in bondage or slavery) named **Otter**. His backstory is that he was captured by the Romans and lived among them before returning to the Wolfings. This makes him the most plausible source for firsthand information about Roman cities and customs.\n\n4.  **Locate the Specific Scene:** The primary scene where the Goths discuss the nature of the Roman threat is the Folk-mote (a tribal assembly) that takes place early in the book (Chapter IV, \"The Folk-mote of the Wolfings\"). In this scene, characters share what they know about the Romans.\n\n5.  **Analyze Otter's Testimony:** During the Folk-mote, Otter is called upon to speak about his experiences as a captive. He describes the vastness and power of the Roman Empire. Crucially, he speaks about their beliefs and the symbols he witnessed in their cities.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Firsthand vs. Hearsay:** The question implies the character saw these things themselves (\"visited a Roman city\"). Otter's status as a former captive who describes what he *saw* fulfills this requirement.\n*   **Recognizable Allusion:** The description should not necessarily name \"Romulus and Remus,\" but should provide enough detail for a reader familiar with Roman mythology to recognize the story. Otter's description is from the perspective of an outsider who might not understand the full context but can describe the imagery.\n*   **The Specific Description:** In his speech, Otter describes a \"brazen image of a she-wolf, and two man-children, stark-naked, sucking the paps of her.\" He also states that the Romans claim \"they have a she-wolf to their mother.\"\n*   **Conclusion:** This description is an unmistakable reference to the Capitoline Wolf statue, the iconic image representing the legend of Romulus and Remus being suckled by a she-wolf. Otter is the character who provides this description based on his time in a Roman city.\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer\n\nBy following the steps above, we have isolated the character, the context, and the specific dialogue that answers the question. The character who has been to a Roman city and describes their religious founding myth (Romulus and Remus) is the thrall, Otter.\n\n<<<Otter>>>"
