    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal and Constraints**\nThe objective is to place the maximum possible number of bishops on the edge squares of a standard 8x8 chessboard. The main constraint is that no bishop can attack another, meaning no two bishops can share the same diagonal. The final question asks for the number of *unoccupied* edge squares.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Edge Squares**\nThe edge squares are those on the perimeter of the board.\n*   There are 8 squares on the first rank (row 1).\n*   There are 8 squares on the last rank (row 8).\n*   There are 8 squares on the first file (column 'a') and 8 on the last file (column 'h').\nTo count the total without double-counting the corners, we can sum the squares on all four sides and subtract the four corner squares: (8 + 8 + 8 + 8) - 4 = 28.\nAlternatively, we can sum the top and bottom rows (8 + 8 = 16) and then add the non-corner squares on the side columns (6 + 6 = 12). 16 + 12 = 28.\nSo, there are 28 edge squares in total.\n\n**Step 3: Utilize the Bishop's Key Property**\nA crucial property of a bishop is that it always stays on squares of the same color. A bishop on a light square can only attack other light squares, and a bishop on a dark square can only attack other dark squares. This means we can solve the problem for the light-colored edge squares and the dark-colored edge squares completely independently and then add the results.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze Edge Squares by Color**\nThe 28 edge squares are perfectly divided by color. You can verify this by looking at a chessboard:\n*   Ranks 1 and 8 each have 4 light and 4 dark squares. (4+4=8 light, 4+4=8 dark)\n*   The non-corner squares on files 'a' and 'h' (from ranks 2 to 7) each have 3 light and 3 dark squares. (3+3=6 light, 3+3=6 dark)\n*   Total dark edge squares: 4 (rank 1) + 4 (rank 8) + 3 (file a) + 3 (file h) = 14.\n*   Total light edge squares: 4 (rank 1) + 4 (rank 8) + 3 (file a) + 3 (file h) = 14.\n\n**Step 5: Maximize Bishops on Dark Edge Squares**\nWe need to find the maximum number of non-attacking bishops we can place on the 14 dark edge squares. Two bishops do not attack each other if they are on different diagonals. On a chessboard, there are two sets of parallel diagonals.\nA simple way to think about this is to realize that all 4 dark squares on the first rank (a1, c1, e1, g1) can be occupied simultaneously, as none share a diagonal. Similarly, the 4 dark squares on the last rank (b8, d8, f8, h8) can be occupied. However, a bishop on a1 attacks h8, c1 attacks f8, etc.\n\nA more rigorous method is to count the diagonals. Consider all the diagonals that pass through the 14 dark edge squares. The maximum number of bishops we can place is limited by the number of unique diagonals available. Placing a bishop on one of the dark squares on the 'a' file (a1, a3, a5, a7) prevents placement on a corresponding dark square on the 'h' file (h8, h6, h4, h2 respectively).\n*   Placing bishops on all 7 dark squares on the 'a' and 'h' files is impossible, as they attack each other.\n*   Placing bishops on all 8 dark squares on the 1st and 8th ranks is also impossible for the same reason.\nThe optimal placement involves a combination. It can be proven that the maximum number of non-attacking bishops on the 14 dark edge squares is **7**. One such placement is on a1, c1, e1, g1, b8, d8, and f8.\n\n**Step 6: Maximize Bishops on Light Edge Squares**\nThe situation for the 14 light edge squares is perfectly symmetrical to the dark squares. The same logic applies, and the maximum number of non-attacking bishops that can be placed on the 14 light edge squares is also **7**. One such placement is on b1, d1, f1, h1, c8, e8, and g8.\n\n**Step 7: Calculate the Total Number of Bishops**\nSince the placements on dark squares and light squares are independent, we can simply add the maximums for each color to find the total maximum number of bishops on the edge of the board.\n*   Total Bishops = (Max on dark squares) + (Max on light squares)\n*   Total Bishops = 7 + 7 = 14.\n\n**Step 8: Answer the Final Question**\nThe question asks for the number of edge squares that *lack* bishops.\n*   Total edge squares = 28\n*   Maximum number of bishops placed = 14\n*   Number of empty edge squares = Total edge squares - Bishops placed\n*   Number of empty edge squares = 28 - 14 = 14.\n\n<<<14>>>"
