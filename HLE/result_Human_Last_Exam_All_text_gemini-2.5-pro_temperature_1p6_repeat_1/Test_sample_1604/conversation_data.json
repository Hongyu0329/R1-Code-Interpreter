    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the latest historical battle depicted in a painting by Lady Butler.\n\n### **Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Understand the Artist:** The question is about Elizabeth Thompson, more famously known as Lady Butler (1846â€“1933). She was a prominent British painter renowned for her military scenes, which were notable for their realism and focus on the common soldier rather than just heroic leaders.\n\n2.  **Identify Major Paintings and the Battles They Depict:** The next step is to list some of her significant paintings and identify the historical battle or campaign associated with each one. The question asks for the date of the *battle*, not the date the painting was created.\n\n    *   ***The 28th Regiment at Quatre Bras***: Depicts the Battle of Quatre Bras, which took place on **June 16, 1815**, during the Napoleonic Wars.\n    *   ***Scotland for Ever!***: Depicts the charge of the Royal Scots Greys at the Battle of Waterloo, which occurred on **June 18, 1815**.\n    *   ***The Remnants of an Army***: Depicts Assistant Surgeon William Brydon's arrival at Jalalabad, the sole European survivor of the 16,500-strong army from the retreat from Kabul during the First Anglo-Afghan War in **January 1842**.\n    *   ***The Roll Call***: Shows a roll call of the Grenadier Guards after the Battle of Inkerman during the Crimean War. The battle was fought on **November 5, 1854**.\n    *   ***Balaclava***: Depicts the aftermath of the Charge of the Light Brigade at the Battle of Balaclava, also during the Crimean War, on **October 25, 1854**.\n    *   ***The Defence of Rorke's Drift***: Portrays the battle at the Rorke's Drift mission station during the Anglo-Zulu War on **January 22-23, 1879**.\n    *   ***Floreat Etona!***: Shows an incident at the Battle of Laing's Nek during the First Boer War on **January 28, 1881**.\n    *   ***After the Battle***: Depicts the aftermath of the Battle of Tel-El-Kebir during the Anglo-Egyptian War, which was fought on **September 13, 1882**.\n    *   ***A Desert Grave***: This painting is set during the Gordon Relief Expedition (part of the Mahdist War) in the Sudan, which took place between **1884-1885**.\n    *   ***In the Retreat from Mons: The Royal Horse Guards***: This work depicts an event during the early stages of World War I. The Retreat from Mons occurred in **late August 1914**.\n\n3.  **Compare the Dates of the Battles:** Now we arrange the events in chronological order to find the latest one.\n\n    *   Battle of Quatre Bras: 1815\n    *   Battle of Waterloo: 1815\n    *   Retreat from Kabul: 1842\n    *   Battle of Balaclava: 1854\n    *   Battle of Inkerman: 1854\n    *   Battle of Rorke's Drift: 1879\n    *   Battle of Laing's Nek: 1881\n    *   Battle of Tel-El-Kebir: 1882\n    *   Gordon Relief Expedition: 1884-1885\n    *   Retreat from Mons: **August 1914**\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** By comparing the dates of all the historical events depicted in her paintings, the latest one is the Retreat from Mons, which was part of the broader Battle of Mons campaign at the beginning of World War I.\n\n### **Careful Points**\n\n*   **Event Date vs. Painting Date:** It is crucial to focus on the date of the historical event, not when Lady Butler painted it. For example, *The Remnants of an Army* (depicting an event from 1842) was painted in 1879.\n*   **Comprehensive List:** While Lady Butler's fame rests on her 19th-century works, it is important to consider her entire career. Her later, less famous paintings depicting World War I are key to answering this question correctly.\n*   **Specificity of the Event:** Paintings like *The Roll Call* depict an event *after* a battle (Inkerman), but the historical context remains the battle itself. The Retreat from Mons is part of the initial phase of combat on the Western Front in WWI.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nThe analysis shows that Lady Butler painted scenes from multiple conflicts spanning over a century. The earliest depicted events are from the Napoleonic Wars (1815), and the latest are from the beginning of World War I (1914). Therefore, the battle depicted in a painting by Lady Butler that occurred latest in history is the Battle of Mons.\n\n<<<Battle of Mons>>>"
