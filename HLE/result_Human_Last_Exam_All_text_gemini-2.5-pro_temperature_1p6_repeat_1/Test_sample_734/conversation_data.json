    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis of the Question\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Subject:** The question asks for a specific \"Christian theologian.\" This narrows the field to prominent figures in Christian history.\n2.  **Identify the Key Action:** This theologian must have \"first developed specialized terminology.\" This means we are looking for an originator of a specific conceptual vocabulary, not just someone who discussed the ideas in general terms.\n3.  **Identify the Concept:** The terminology must be able to \"describe changes in the laws of nature.\" This involves the intersection of theology, philosophy, and what we might call protoscientific thought about how the world works.\n4.  **Identify the Specific Applications:** The framework must be applicable to two distinct types of events:\n    *   **The virgin birth of Jesus:** A specific, one-time miraculous event that suspends or overrides the normal biological laws of human reproduction.\n    *   **Possible alterations in natural laws at the Fall:** A foundational, systemic, and ongoing change to the entire natural order. This refers to the idea that after the sin of Adam and Eve, nature itself was cursed or altered (e.g., introduction of death, pain in childbirth, thorns and thistles).\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **\"First developed\":** This points to a foundational figure whose ideas influenced later thinkers. We should look to early Church Fathers before later Scholastics or Reformers.\n*   **\"Specialized terminology\":** We need to identify specific Latin or Greek terms or distinct concepts that the theologian used, not just a general discussion of miracles.\n*   **Distinguishing the two applications:** The theologian's system must be robust enough to handle both a singular, exceptional miracle and a permanent, systemic shift in how nature operates. This is a crucial distinction. A simple definition of \"miracle\" might cover the first point but not the second.\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer with Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Initial Candidates:** Major theologians who wrote extensively on creation, providence, and miracles are the primary candidates. This includes figures like Irenaeus, Origen, Augustine of Hippo, and Thomas Aquinas.\n\n2.  **Evaluating the Candidates:**\n    *   **Thomas Aquinas (13th Century):** Aquinas developed the highly influential distinction between God's \"absolute power\" (*potentia Dei absoluta*) and \"ordained power\" (*potentia Dei ordinata*). This is a powerful framework for discussing miracles. However, Aquinas lived much later. The question asks who \"first\" developed such terminology. Aquinas was building upon a long tradition.\n    *   **Early Fathers (before Augustine):** Figures like Irenaeus and Origen discussed the effects of the Fall and the reality of miracles, but they did not develop a systematic, specialized vocabulary concerning the \"laws of nature\" with the same philosophical rigor as later thinkers.\n\n3.  **Focusing on Augustine of Hippo (354-430 AD):** Augustine is the most compelling candidate. He wrote extensively on these exact topics in works like *The City of God* and *On the Literal Interpretation of Genesis* (*De Genesi ad litteram*). He was forced to think systematically about nature to counter the dualistic claims of the Manichaeans, who argued that material things like the body were inherently evil.\n\n4.  **Augustine's Specialized Terminology:**\n    *   Augustine frequently used the term **ordo naturae** (the order of nature) or **lex naturae** (the law of nature) to describe the regular, observable course of events established by God.\n    *   He developed a key distinction for miracles. He argued that a miracle is not **contra naturam** (against nature), because the ultimate \"nature\" of any created thing is the will of its Creator. Instead, a miracle is **praeter ordinem naturae** (beyond the *usual* order of nature) or contrary to nature *as we know it*.\n\n5.  **Applying Augustine's Terminology:**\n    *   **To the Virgin Birth:** The virgin birth is a perfect example of an event that is *praeter ordinem naturae*. It is beyond the usual, known course of nature (human conception) but is not *against* nature in an absolute sense, because it was accomplished by the will of God, the author of nature. Augustine also used his concept of **rationes seminales** (seminal reasons)—latent potentials embedded in creation by God—to explain that the potential for such an event was placed in nature from the beginning, to be activated at God's chosen time.\n    *   **To the Fall:** Augustine's framework also powerfully describes a change in the *ordo naturae* itself at the Fall. He argued that before the Fall, the \"law of nature\" for humanity included immortality, freedom from disease, and procreation without lust or pain. The Fall introduced a **penal condition** into nature. Death, concupiscence, toil (\"thorns and thistles\"), and pain in childbirth became part of the new, post-Fall *ordo naturae*. This represents a fundamental and enduring alteration of the laws governing human and terrestrial life.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** Augustine was the first Christian theologian to develop a sophisticated and specialized vocabulary (*ordo naturae*, *praeter naturam*, *rationes seminales*) that could cohesively explain both singular miracles like the Virgin Birth and a systemic alteration of natural laws resulting from the Fall. His work laid the foundation for virtually all subsequent Western theological discussion on the topic.\n\n<<<Augustine of Hippo>>>"
