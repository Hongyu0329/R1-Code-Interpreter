The proposed filtering strategy is a two-criterion approach designed to specifically identify and remove genes originating from cancer cell contamination in your RNA-seq data. This is implemented after running a paired differential expression analysis (e.g., `~ donor + condition`) that compares your `CAR_IL15` samples against your `CAR_only` samples.

The strategy involves the following steps:

1.  **Generate DGE Results:** Perform your differential gene expression analysis and export the results to a tab-separated file (`dge_results.tsv`). Crucially, this file must contain, for each gene, its `log2FoldChange` and the `mean of normalized counts` from the clean (`CAR_IL15`) experimental group.

2.  **Define Filtering Criteria:** A gene is identified as a contaminant if it meets **both** of the following conditions, which together define a signature of being present in the contaminated samples but absent in the clean ones:
    *   **Criterion 1 (Large Negative Fold Change):** The gene's log2 fold change is less than a stringent threshold, such as -5. This isolates genes that are at least 32-fold more abundant in the contaminated `CAR_only` group.
    *   **Criterion 2 (Low Expression in Clean Group):** The gene's mean normalized count in the `CAR_IL15` group is below a noise-level threshold, such as 10. This ensures you are only removing genes that are effectively absent in your clean samples.

3.  **Implement via Command Line:** Use the `awk` command-line utility to process your results file. This command will read `dge_results.tsv` and write a new `filtered_dge_results.tsv` file, excluding the rows that match the contaminant criteria. Assuming `log2FoldChange` is in the 2nd column and `mean_counts_CAR_IL15` is in the 4th column, the command is:

    ```bash
    awk 'BEGIN{FS="\t"; OFS="\t"} NR==1 || !($2 < -5 && $4 < 10) {print}' dge_results.tsv > filtered_dge_results.tsv
    ```
    This command preserves the header row (`NR==1`) and any gene that does not meet both contaminant conditions simultaneously, thus cleaning your data while protecting genuinely downregulated genes.
