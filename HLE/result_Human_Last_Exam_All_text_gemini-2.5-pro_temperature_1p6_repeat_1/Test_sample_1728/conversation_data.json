    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the maximal chromatic number of the graph \\(G\\).\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Graph G and the \"Sum\" Operation\n\nThe problem states that \\(G\\) is the \"sum\" of three cycles of length \\(n\\). The term \"sum of graphs\" can be ambiguous, as there are several ways to combine graphs. Let's analyze the most common interpretations and their implications for the chromatic number.\n\n*   **Interpretation A: Cartesian Product (\\(G_1 \\square G_2\\))**\n    This operation is sometimes referred to as a graph sum. For the Cartesian product, the chromatic number is given by \\( \\chi(G_1 \\square G_2) = \\max(\\chi(G_1), \\chi(G_2)) \\).\n    In our case, \\(G = C_n \\square C_n \\square C_n\\), so \\( \\chi(G) = \\max(\\chi(C_n), \\chi(C_n), \\chi(C_n)) = \\chi(C_n) \\). The maximum value of \\( \\chi(C_n) \\) is 3 (for odd \\(n\\)). This would yield a maximal chromatic number of 3.\n\n*   **Interpretation B: Edge Union**\n    This interpretation assumes the three cycles are on the same set of \\(n\\) vertices. The graph \\(G\\) would have \\(n\\) vertices, and its edge set would be the union of the edge sets of the three cycles. The maximum degree \\( \\Delta(G) \\) would be at most \\(2+2+2=6\\). By Brooks' Theorem, \\( \\chi(G) \\leq \\Delta(G) \\) unless \\(G\\) is a complete graph or an odd cycle. It is possible to choose three 7-cycles on 7 vertices whose union is the complete graph \\(K_7\\). For this graph, \\( \\chi(G) = \\chi(K_7) = 7 \\). The maximum degree is 6, so by Brooks' Theorem, the chromatic number cannot exceed 7 unless \\(G=K_7\\). Thus, the maximal chromatic number under this interpretation is 7.\n\n*   **Interpretation C: Graph Join (\\(G_1 + G_2\\))**\n    The join operation is very commonly denoted by a `+` sign and referred to as a \"sum\". The join \\(G_1 + G_2\\) is formed from the disjoint union of \\(G_1\\) and \\(G_2\\) by adding all possible edges between the vertices of \\(G_1\\) and the vertices of \\(G_2\\). A key property of the join is that the chromatic number of the resulting graph is the sum of the chromatic numbers of the original graphs: \\( \\chi(G_1 + G_2) = \\chi(G_1) + \\chi(G_2) \\).\n\nGiven the standard terminology in graph theory, the \"join\" operation is the most likely intended meaning of \"sum\" in this context, especially since it has a direct and additive effect on the chromatic number, which makes for a classic graph theory problem. We will proceed with this interpretation.\n\n### Step 2: Applying the Join Operation\n\nLet \\(G\\) be the join of three cycles of length \\(n\\), which we denote as \\(C_n^{(1)}, C_n^{(2)}, C_n^{(3)}\\).\n\\( G = C_n^{(1)} + C_n^{(2)} + C_n^{(3)} \\)\n\nUsing the property of the chromatic number for the join operation, which is associative:\n\\( \\chi(G) = \\chi(C_n^{(1)}) + \\chi(C_n^{(2)}) + \\chi(C_n^{(3)}) \\)\n\nSince all three graphs are cycles of the same length \\(n\\), their chromatic numbers are identical:\n\\( \\chi(G) = 3 \\cdot \\chi(C_n) \\)\n\n### Step 3: Determining the Chromatic Number of a Cycle (\\(C_n\\))\n\nThe chromatic number of a cycle \\(C_n\\) depends on whether its length \\(n\\) is even or odd (assuming \\(n \\ge 3\\)).\n*   **If \\(n\\) is even:** The cycle is a bipartite graph, and its vertices can be colored with just two colors. So, \\( \\chi(C_n) = 2 \\).\n*   **If \\(n\\) is odd:** The cycle is not bipartite. At least three colors are required. For example, in \\(C_3\\), each vertex must have a unique color. In \\(C_5\\), you can color the vertices 1, 2, 1, 2, but the last vertex is adjacent to vertices of color 1 and 2, requiring a third color. So, for odd \\(n\\), \\( \\chi(C_n) = 3 \\).\n\n### Step 4: Calculating the Maximal Chromatic Number of G\n\nWe want to find the maximal possible value for \\( \\chi(G) \\). The formula for \\(G\\)'s chromatic number is \\( \\chi(G) = 3 \\cdot \\chi(C_n) \\). To maximize \\( \\chi(G) \\), we must choose the cycle length \\(n\\) such that \\( \\chi(C_n) \\) is maximized.\n\nFrom Step 3, the maximum value of \\( \\chi(C_n) \\) is 3, which occurs when \\(n\\) is any odd integer (e.g., \\(n=3, 5, 7, \\dots\\)).\n\nSubstituting this maximum value into our equation:\nMaximal \\( \\chi(G) = 3 \\cdot \\max(\\chi(C_n)) = 3 \\cdot 3 = 9 \\)\n\n### Careful Points Summary\n1.  **Interpretation of \"Sum\":** The crucial step is interpreting the \"sum\" of graphs. The graph join is the most standard interpretation for the \"+\" symbol and the word \"sum\" that leads to an additive chromatic number. Other interpretations like Cartesian product or edge union yield different results (3 and 7, respectively).\n2.  **Chromatic Number of a Cycle:** The analysis hinges on the well-known result that \\( \\chi(C_n) \\) is 2 for even \\(n\\) and 3 for odd \\(n\\).\n3.  **Maximization:** The question asks for the \"maximal\" chromatic number, which requires considering all possible values of \\(n\\) and selecting the one that maximizes \\( \\chi(C_n) \\).\n\nBased on this step-by-step analysis, the maximal chromatic number is 9.\n\n<<<9>>>"
