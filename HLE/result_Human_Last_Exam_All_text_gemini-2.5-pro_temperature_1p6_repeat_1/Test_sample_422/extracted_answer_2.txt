The two problems are:
1.  **The Infinite Regress of Justification:** The requirement for justification leads to an infinite regress. To know a proposition (P), one's belief must be justified. To be sure it is knowledge, one must *know* their justification is valid. To know the justification is valid, one needs a further justification for that, and so on, infinitely. This makes it impossible to ever meet the justification condition.
2.  **The Inaccessibility of the Truth Condition:** The definition requires that the belief be objectively true, a fact about the external world. However, an agent has no way to step outside of their own subjective experience and beliefs to directly verify this objective truth. Any attempt to check if a belief is true only results in another belief. Therefore, the agent can never confirm that this condition has been met.
