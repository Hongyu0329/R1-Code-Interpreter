    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Premise**\n\n*   **Definition of Knowledge:** The problem specifies we must use the JTB (Justified True Belief) definition. This means for a subject S to know a proposition P, three conditions must be met:\n    1.  **T (Truth):** P must be true.\n    2.  **B (Belief):** S must believe that P is true.\n    3.  **J (Justification):** S must be justified in believing that P is true.\n*   **Constraint 1: Limited Epistemic States:** Our only available states are \"Knowledge\" and \"Belief\". This is a crucial constraint. It means any mental state about a proposition is either one or the other. There is no intermediate state like \"having justification\" that exists independently of knowing or believing. To assert you have justification, you must either *believe* you have it or *know* you have it.\n*   **Constraint 2: Ignore Gettier Problems:** Gettier problems challenge the *sufficiency* of the JTB conditions (i.e., you can have a JTB that isn't knowledge). By ignoring them, we must focus on problems related to the *necessity* or internal coherence of the conditions themselves.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the First Problem - The Regress of Justification**\n\n*   **The Core Issue:** The JTB definition requires justification. Let's examine this justification condition (J) under the given constraints.\n*   **Analysis:** For me to know P, I must be justified in believing P. But how do I know that I am justified? If my only epistemic states are Knowledge and Belief, then to properly ground my claim to knowledge, I can't just *believe* I'm justified; that would be arbitrary. I must *know* I am justified.\n*   **Applying JTB to Justification:** Let's call the proposition \"My belief in P is justified\" J-P. To *know* J-P, I must have a justified true belief in J-P. This means:\n    1.  J-P must be true (my justification must actually be valid).\n    2.  I must believe J-P.\n    3.  I must be *justified* in believing J-P.\n*   **The Regress:** This third point creates a new requirement: a justification for my justification. Let's call this J-J-P. To know that *this* justification is valid, I would again need to apply the JTB rule, leading to a requirement for J-J-J-P, and so on.\n*   **Conclusion for Problem 1:** This creates an infinite regress. To know any single thing, one would need to possess an infinite chain of known justifications. Since this is impossible, knowledge under the JTB definition becomes unattainable. This is known as the **Agrippan trilemma**'s regress problem, made particularly stark by the constraint that justification must be *known*.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Second Problem - The Inaccessibility of the Truth Condition**\n\n*   **The Core Issue:** The JTB definition requires that the proposition P be objectively true. This is a condition about the external world, not about the agent's mental state.\n*   **Analysis:** How can an epistemic agent, from their own subjective perspective, ever confirm that the \"Truth\" condition is met? The agent has access to their beliefs and their justifications (e.g., sensory data, logical arguments), but they have no direct, unmediated access to \"Truth\" itself.\n*   **The Verification Circle:** To verify that P is true, the agent must use their epistemic toolsâ€”gathering evidence and forming a belief. But the JTB definition sets up \"P is true\" as an independent, prerequisite condition that must be met *before* knowledge is granted. The agent can't step outside of their own mind to get a \"God's-eye view\" to check if their belief corresponds to reality. Any attempt to verify the truth of P simply results in a new, hopefully more justified, belief about P.\n*   **Conclusion for Problem 2:** The agent can never confirm they have met the Truth condition. They can only have a justified belief that they have met it. This makes the \"T\" in JTB a condition that is fundamentally inaccessible from the agent's perspective. The definition demands something (objective certainty of truth) that an epistemic agent cannot provide, making it an impractical and unverifiable standard.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n1.  **The Role of the Constraints:** The limited epistemic states (\"Knowledge\" and \"Belief\" only) are key. This forces the justification itself to be an object of knowledge, triggering the regress. It also highlights the gap between having a *belief* about truth and accessing the *fact* of truth.\n2.  **JTB's Internal vs. External Conditions:** The problem arises from JTB mixing internal, subjective conditions (Belief, Justification) with an external, objective condition (Truth). The two problems attack this structure: one shows the internal condition (Justification) is an impossible standard, and the other shows the external condition (Truth) is inaccessible.\n3.  **Distinction from Gettier:** These are not Gettier problems. Gettier problems are cases where all three JTB conditions *are* met, but we still intuitively feel it isn't knowledge due to luck. The two problems identified here argue that the conditions themselves are either impossible to satisfy (justification regress) or impossible to verify (inaccessibility of truth), preventing knowledge from ever being established in the first place.\n\n<<<The two problems are:\n1.  **The Infinite Regress of Justification:** The requirement for justification leads to an infinite regress. To know a proposition (P), one's belief must be justified. To be sure it is knowledge, one must *know* their justification is valid. To know the justification is valid, one needs a further justification for that, and so on, infinitely. This makes it impossible to ever meet the justification condition.\n2.  **The Inaccessibility of the Truth Condition:** The definition requires that the belief be objectively true, a fact about the external world. However, an agent has no way to step outside of their own subjective experience and beliefs to directly verify this objective truth. Any attempt to check if a belief is true only results in another belief. Therefore, the agent can never confirm that this condition has been met.>>>"
