    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the difference between a cambré derrière in the Vaganova and Balanchine methods.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Movement - Cambré Derrière**\n*Cambré* means \"arched.\" *Derrière* means \"to the back.\" A *cambré derrière* is a bend of the upper body backward from the waist. It is a common movement in ballet adagio (slow, controlled movements) used to develop flexibility, strength, and grace.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Vaganova Method's Approach**\n*   **Core Principles:** The Vaganova method, developed by Agrippina Vaganova in Russia, emphasizes precision, strength, and purity of line. A key principle is maintaining correct anatomical alignment to build a strong and injury-free technique.\n*   **Execution of Cambré Derrière:** In the Vaganova method, the bend initiates from the upper thoracic spine (the upper back). The dancer must maintain a strong core and keep the lower back long and supported. The most crucial rule is that the **hips must remain square and directly over the supporting legs.** They are not allowed to push forward. This isolates the bend in the upper and mid-spine, building spinal flexibility and core control. The head follows the arm and the line of the back, looking up and back in an elegant arc, but the focus is on a controlled bend from a stable foundation.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Balanchine Method's Approach**\n*   **Core Principles:** The Balanchine method, developed by George Balanchine for his New York City Ballet, emphasizes speed, musicality, length of line, and a more dynamic, \"off-balance\" aesthetic.\n*   **Execution of Cambré Derrière:** In the Balanchine style, the primary goal is often to create the longest, most visually dramatic line possible. To achieve a deeper and more expansive backbend in *cambré derrière*, the dancer is taught to **push the hip of the working leg (or both hips) forward.** This release of the hips allows the pelvis to tilt, which in turn facilitates a much deeper bend through the entire spine, including the lumbar (lower) region. This creates a sweeping, open arc from the tips of the toes to the fingers.\n\n**Step 4: Compare and Identify the Key Difference**\n*   **Vaganova:** Stable, square hips. Bend is isolated in the upper/mid back. Focus is on control and spinal articulation from a fixed base.\n*   **Balanchine:** Hip(s) press forward. The entire body is used to create a deep, dynamic arc. Focus is on creating a long, extended line.\n\nThe fundamental, technical instruction that separates the two styles for this specific step is what the dancer does with their hips.\n\n### Evaluation of Answer Choices\n\n*   **A. Arm placement during allongé:** While there might be stylistic nuances, the general path and placement of the arms in relation to the backbend are similar. This is not the primary distinguishing factor.\n*   **B. Placement of hip:** This is the core technical difference. Vaganova technique insists on keeping the hips square and stationary, while Balanchine technique instructs the dancer to push the hip forward. This is the correct answer.\n*   **C. Speed:** While Balanchine's style is generally faster, a *cambré* can be performed at various speeds in both methods. Speed is a quality of the performance, not a fundamental technical difference in the execution of the *cambré* itself.\n*   **D. Degree of backbend:** The Balanchine method typically results in a deeper backbend, but this is a *consequence* of the difference in hip placement. The hip placement is the *cause*, the technical instruction that leads to the greater degree. Therefore, \"placement of hip\" is a more precise and foundational answer.\n*   **E. Placement of head:** The head follows the line of the back in both techniques. The Balanchine head position might appear more extreme simply because the backbend is deeper, but the principle of the head completing the line is common to both. The hip action is the defining mechanical difference.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe most significant and defining difference between a Vaganova and a Balanchine *cambré derrière* is the intentional placement of the hips. Vaganova requires a stable, square pelvis, while Balanchine encourages a forward press of the hip to achieve a deeper bend.\n\n<<<B>>>"
