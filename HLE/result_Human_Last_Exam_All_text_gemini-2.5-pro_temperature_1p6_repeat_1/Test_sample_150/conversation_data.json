    "Answering this question requires a multi-faceted analysis of the provided Java program, the problem's requirements, and the principles of efficient C programming.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis of the Question\n\n1.  **Understand the Core Task:** The goal is to execute a simple program written in \"Bit++\". The program consists of `n` statements that either increment or decrement a single variable, `x`, which starts at 0. The final value of `x` must be printed.\n2.  **Identify the Operations:** There are two operations: `++` (increment) and `--` (decrement).\n3.  **Identify the Variable:** There is only one variable, `X`.\n4.  **Deconstruct the Statements:** A statement combines one operation and the variable `X`. The order can be prefix (`++X`, `--X`) or postfix (`X++`, `X--`). This means there are four possible valid statements.\n5.  **Analyze the Input:** The first input is an integer `n`, the number of statements. This is followed by `n` lines, each containing one of the four possible statements.\n6.  **Analyze the Provided Program:** The submission is in Java. We must determine if it correctly handles all four types of statements and produces the correct final value for `x`.\n7.  **Efficiency Requirement:** If the program is incorrect, a new C program must be written that is \"the most efficient: fastest and least memory\". This requires optimizing for both execution speed and memory usage.\n8.  **Output Format:** The final answer must be a single string. If the Java program is correct, the answer is \"Y\". If it is incorrect, the answer is \"Nx+y\", where `x` is the minimal number of character comparisons for `n=100`, and `y` is the minimal memory usage in bytes for the efficient C solution.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Completeness of Logic:** The crucial point is whether the Java code handles all four statement variations (`++X`, `X++`, `--X`, `X--`). A common mistake is to only check for one variation (e.g., only the prefix form).\n*   **Efficiency Nuances:** \"Fastest\" implies minimizing CPU cycles. For this problem, it means reducing the work done inside the loop that runs `n` times. This includes minimizing comparisons and avoiding slow library functions. \"Least memory\" implies using the smallest appropriate data types for variables and avoiding large buffers.\n*   **Data Type Ranges:** The problem states `1 <= n <= 150`. This means the final value of `x` will be in the range `[-150, 150]`. The choice of data type in C must be able to hold these values. A `signed char` (1 byte, range -128 to 127) is **not** sufficient. A `signed short` (2 bytes, range -32,768 to 32,767) is the smallest standard type that works.\n*   **Calculation Specifics:** The values for `x` (comparisons) and `y` (memory) must be calculated for the *most efficient* C implementation, not just any correct implementation.\n\n### Step-by-Step Acquisition of the Final Answer\n\n**1. Analysis of the Submitted Java Program**\n\nThe Java code contains the following logic inside its loop:\n```java\nString test = inpt.next();\nif (test.contains(\"++X\")) {\n    tresult++;\n}\nif (test.contains(\"--X\")) {\n    tresult--;\n}\n```\nLet's test this logic against all possible statements:\n*   `test = \"++X\"`: `test.contains(\"++X\")` is `true`. `tresult` is incremented. **Correct.**\n*   `test = \"X++\"`: `test.contains(\"++X\")` is `false`. Nothing happens. **Incorrect.**\n*   `test = \"--X\"`: `test.contains(\"--X\")` is `true`. `tresult` is decremented. **Correct.**\n*   `test = \"X--\"`: `test.contains(\"--X\")` is `false`. Nothing happens. **Incorrect.**\n\nThe program fails to handle the postfix operations (`X++` and `X--`). Therefore, **the program does not solve the problem correctly.** The answer must begin with \"N\".\n\n**2. Designing the Most Efficient C Program**\n\nTo be maximally efficient, we need to find the simplest possible check to distinguish an increment from a decrement.\n\n*   `++X`\n*   `X++`\n*   `--X`\n*   `X--`\n\nNotice that in all four cases, the character at index 1 (the middle character) is `+` for an increment and `-` for a decrement. This provides a highly efficient check.\n\n**3. Calculating `x` (Character Comparisons)**\n\n*   The most efficient C code will read each 3-character statement and check only the middle character.\n*   The logic inside the loop will be equivalent to `if (statement[1] == '+')`.\n*   This is exactly **one character comparison** per statement.\n*   The question asks for the count when the input has `n = 100` instructions.\n*   Total comparisons = 100 statements * 1 comparison/statement = 100.\n*   Thus, **x = 100**.\n\n**4. Calculating `y` (Memory Size)**\n\n*   We need to store the number of statements, `n`, and the result, `x`.\n*   Constraints: `1 <= n <= 150` and `-150 <= x <= 150`.\n*   As determined earlier, a `signed short` (2 bytes) is the smallest standard data type that can safely store these values.\n*   The most memory-efficient C program would use one `short` for the loop counter and one `short` for the accumulator. It would avoid larger data types like `int` (4 bytes) and temporary string buffers if possible (e.g., by using `getchar()`).\n*   Smallest memory size for variables = `sizeof(short)` for `n` + `sizeof(short)` for `x`.\n*   Total memory = 2 bytes + 2 bytes = 4 bytes.\n*   Thus, **y = 4**.\n\n**5. Final Answer Formulation**\n\n*   The Java code is incorrect, so we start with `N`.\n*   The smallest number of character comparisons (`x`) is 100.\n*   The smallest memory size (`y`) is 4.\n*   Combining these into the format `Nx+y` gives `N100+4`.\n\n<<<N100+4>>>"
