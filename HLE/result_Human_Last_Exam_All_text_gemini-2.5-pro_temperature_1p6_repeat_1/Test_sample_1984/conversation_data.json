    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the differential equation and its equilibrium points.**\nThe given differential equation is:\n$$x'(t) = -x^{3}(t) + 2x^{2}(t) - x(t)$$\nThis is an autonomous first-order differential equation of the form $x'(t) = f(x)$, where $f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 - x$.\n\nEquilibrium points (or critical points) are the values of $x$ for which $x'(t) = 0$. To find them, we must solve the equation $f(x) = 0$.\n$$ -x^3 + 2x^2 - x = 0 $$\nFirst, we can factor out $-x$:\n$$ -x(x^2 - 2x + 1) = 0 $$\nThe term in the parentheses is a perfect square, $(x-1)^2$. So the equation becomes:\n$$ -x(x-1)^2 = 0 $$\nThe solutions to this equation are $x = 0$ and $x = 1$. These are the two equilibrium points of the system.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the stability of each equilibrium point.**\nThe stability of an equilibrium point $x_0$ can be determined by examining the sign of the derivative of $f(x)$ at that point, i.e., $f'(x_0)$.\n*   If $f'(x_0) < 0$, the equilibrium point is stable.\n*   If $f'(x_0) > 0$, the equilibrium point is unstable.\n*   If $f'(x_0) = 0$, the test is inconclusive, and we need to analyze the sign of $f(x)$ in the neighborhood of $x_0$.\n\nFirst, let's find the derivative of $f(x)$:\n$$ f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 - x $$\n$$ f'(x) = -3x^2 + 4x - 1 $$\n\nNow, we test each equilibrium point:\n*   **For the equilibrium point $x = 0$:**\n    Substitute $x=0$ into $f'(x)$:\n    $$ f'(0) = -3(0)^2 + 4(0) - 1 = -1 $$\n    Since $f'(0) = -1 < 0$, the equilibrium point $x=0$ is **stable**.\n\n*   **For the equilibrium point $x = 1$:**\n    Substitute $x=1$ into $f'(x)$:\n    $$ f'(1) = -3(1)^2 + 4(1) - 1 = -3 + 4 - 1 = 0 $$\n    Since $f'(1) = 0$, the first derivative test is inconclusive. We must use a phase line analysis by checking the sign of $f(x) = -x(x-1)^2$ around $x=1$.\n\n**Step 3: Phase Line Analysis for $x=1$.**\nWe need to check the sign of $f(x)$ on either side of $x=1$.\n*   **For $x$ slightly less than 1 (e.g., in the interval $(0, 1)$):** Let's take $x=0.5$.\n    $f(0.5) = -0.5(0.5-1)^2 = -0.5(-0.5)^2 = -0.5(0.25) = -0.125 < 0$.\n    Since $f(x) < 0$, the solution $x(t)$ decreases, moving away from $x=1$.\n\n*   **For $x$ slightly greater than 1 (e.g., in the interval $(1, \\infty)$):** Let's take $x=2$.\n    $f(2) = -2(2-1)^2 = -2(1)^2 = -2 < 0$.\n    Since $f(x) < 0$, the solution $x(t)$ decreases, moving towards $x=1$.\n\n**Summary of behavior near $x=1$:**\n- To the left of $x=1$, trajectories move away from it (towards $x=0$).\n- To the right of $x=1$, trajectories move towards it.\n\nAn equilibrium point is only considered stable if trajectories from both sides converge to it. Since trajectories starting to the left of $x=1$ move away from it, $x=1$ is not a stable equilibrium. It is classified as **semistable**.\n\n**Step 4: Find the value of $m$.**\nThe variable $m$ represents the number of stable equilibrium points. Based on our analysis:\n*   $x=0$ is a stable equilibrium point.\n*   $x=1$ is a semistable (and therefore not stable) equilibrium point.\n\nThus, there is only one stable equilibrium point.\n$$ m = 1 $$\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the final expression.**\nThe question asks to find the value of $m - 2^{4048}$.\nSubstituting the value of $m=1$:\n$$ 1 - 2^{4048} $$\n\nThe final answer is $1 - 2^{4048}$.\n\n<<<1 - 2^{4048}>>>"
