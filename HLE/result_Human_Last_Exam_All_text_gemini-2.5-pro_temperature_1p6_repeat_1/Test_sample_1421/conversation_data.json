    "The question asks for the formula of the fermionic partition function `Z` using the imaginary time path integral formalism. We will break down the derivation and concepts involved to arrive at the final formula.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: The Definition of the Partition Function**\n\nThe starting point in quantum statistical mechanics is the canonical partition function, `Z`. It is defined as the trace of the statistical weight operator, `e^(-βH)`:\n  \n  `Z = Tr(e^(-βH))`\n\nwhere:\n*   `Tr` is the trace operation, taken over a complete set of states of the system.\n*   `H` is the Hamiltonian operator of the fermionic system.\n*   `β = 1/(k_B T)` is the inverse temperature, with `k_B` being the Boltzmann constant and `T` the absolute temperature.\n\n**Step 2: Introducing the Path Integral Concept in Imaginary Time**\n\nThe core idea of the path integral is to express `Z` not in terms of operators and states, but as an integral over all possible field configurations (\"histories\" or \"paths\"). This is achieved by:\n\n1.  **Imaginary Time:** We perform a Wick rotation from real time `t` to imaginary time `τ` by setting `t = -iτ`. The time evolution operator `e^(-iHt/ħ)` becomes the statistical operator `e^(-βH)` by setting `τ = βħ`. For simplicity, we'll set `ħ = 1`. The imaginary time variable `τ` is periodic on the interval `[0, β]`.\n\n2.  **Time Slicing:** We break the imaginary time interval `β` into `N` infinitesimally small slices of duration `ε = β/N`. The operator `e^(-βH)` can be written as a product:\n\n    `e^(-βH) = e^(-εH) * e^(-εH) * ... * e^(-εH)` (`N` times)\n\n3.  **Inserting Complete Sets of States:** We insert a complete set of states between each of the `e^(-εH)` factors. For fermions, the appropriate states are **fermionic coherent states**.\n\n**Step 3: Fermionic Coherent States and Grassmann Numbers (A Careful Point)**\n\nFermions obey the Pauli exclusion principle, which means their creation (`c†`) and annihilation (`c`) operators anti-commute. To build a path integral for them, we cannot use ordinary numbers. We must use **Grassmann numbers** (`ψ`, `ψ*`).\n\n*   **Key Property:** Grassmann numbers are anti-commuting variables. For any two Grassmann numbers `η` and `θ`, we have:\n    `ηθ = -θη`\n    A direct consequence is that the square of any Grassmann number is zero: `η² = 0`. This mathematically represents the Pauli principle (two fermions cannot occupy the same state).\n\n*   **Fermionic Coherent States:** These states are parameterized by Grassmann numbers and are defined as `|ψ⟩ = exp(-∑_k ψ_k c†_k) |0⟩`, where `|0⟩` is the vacuum state.\n\n**Step 4: Building the Path Integral Expression**\n\nUsing the properties of fermionic coherent states, the trace operation can be written as:\n\n`Tr(A) = ∫ dψ* dψ e^(-ψ*ψ) ⟨-ψ| A |ψ⟩`\n\n*   **Careful Point: The Minus Sign:** The `-ψ` in the bra-state `⟨-ψ|` is a crucial detail for fermions. It is this minus sign that will lead to anti-periodic boundary conditions.\n\nApplying this to the partition function `Z`, and inserting `N-1` intermediate coherent states, we get a discrete expression that involves a product of matrix elements like `⟨ψ_{j+1}|e^(-εH)|ψ_j⟩`.\n\n**Step 5: The Continuum Limit and the Action**\n\nAs we take the limit `N → ∞` (`ε → 0`), the discrete sums and products become integrals:\n\n*   The product of Grassmann integration measures `∏ dψ_j* dψ_j` becomes the **functional measure**, denoted `Dψ* Dψ`.\n*   The sum over discrete time steps becomes an integral over the imaginary time variable `τ`: `∑_j ε ... → ∫_0^β dτ ...`.\n*   The argument of the exponential becomes the **Euclidean action**, `S`.\n\nThe resulting path integral is expressed as:\n\n`Z = ∫ Dψ* Dψ exp(-S[ψ*, ψ])`\n\nThe Euclidean action `S` for a general fermionic system has the form:\n\n`S[ψ*, ψ] = ∫_0^β dτ ∫ d^d x [ ψ*(x,τ) ∂_τ ψ(x,τ) + H(ψ*(x,τ), ψ(x,τ)) ]`\n\nHere, `H(ψ*, ψ)` is the Hamiltonian density where the fermion operators have been replaced by their corresponding Grassmann field variables. The term `ψ* ∂_τ ψ` arises naturally from the overlap of coherent states at adjacent time slices in the continuum limit.\n\n**Step 6: Anti-Periodic Boundary Conditions (A Crucial Careful Point)**\n\nThe most important feature distinguishing the fermionic path integral from the bosonic one is the boundary condition on the fields in the imaginary time direction. Because of the `⟨-ψ|...|ψ⟩` structure of the trace, the fields must be **anti-periodic** over the interval `[0, β]`.\n\nThis means that a field configuration `ψ(x, τ)` is only included in the path integral if it satisfies:\n\n`ψ(x, 0) = -ψ(x, β)`\n`ψ*(x, 0) = -ψ*(x, β)`\n\nThese are known as Anti-Periodic Boundary Conditions (APBC). For bosons, the boundary conditions would be periodic (`φ(x, 0) = φ(x, β)`), which leads to Bose-Einstein statistics. The APBC for fermions correctly reproduces Fermi-Dirac statistics.\n\n### Final Formula\n\nPutting all these elements together, we arrive at the formula for the fermionic partition function.\n\n---\nThe formula for the fermionic partition function `Z` in the imaginary time path integral formalism is given by a functional integral over all anti-commuting Grassmann fields `ψ(x, τ)` and `ψ*(x, τ)`. These fields must obey anti-periodic boundary conditions in the imaginary time direction `τ`. The formula is:\n\n**Z = ∫_{APBC} Dψ* Dψ exp(-S[ψ*, ψ])**\n\nwhere:\n\n*   **∫_{APBC} Dψ* Dψ** is the functional integral over all fermionic field configurations that satisfy the **Anti-Periodic Boundary Conditions (APBC)**:\n    `ψ(x, τ = β) = -ψ(x, τ = 0)`\n    `ψ*(x, τ = β) = -ψ*(x, τ = 0)`\n\n*   **S[ψ*, ψ]** is the **Euclidean Action** for the fermionic system, given by:\n    **S = ∫₀^β dτ ∫ dᵈx L_E** \n    where `L_E` is the Euclidean Lagrangian density, which commonly takes the form:\n    **L_E = ψ*(x, τ) (∂/∂τ) ψ(x, τ) + H(ψ*(x, τ), ψ(x, τ))**\n\n*   **τ** is the imaginary time variable, integrated from `0` to `β = 1/(k_B T)`.\n*   **x** represents the spatial coordinates, integrated over the volume of the system.\n*   **H(ψ*, ψ)** is the system's Hamiltonian density, with the fermion operators replaced by the corresponding Grassmann fields.\n\n<<<The formula for the fermionic partition function Z in the imaginary time path integral formalism is:\nZ = ∫_{ψ(β)=-ψ(0)} Dψ* Dψ exp( - ∫_0^β dτ ∫ d^d x [ ψ*(x,τ) ∂_τ ψ(x,τ) + H(ψ*(x,τ), ψ(x,τ)) ] )\nwhere ψ and ψ* are anti-commuting Grassmann fields, Dψ* Dψ is the functional integration measure, β is the inverse temperature, and the integral is performed over fields satisfying anti-periodic boundary conditions (APBC) in the imaginary time direction τ. The term H(ψ*,ψ) is the Hamiltonian density expressed in terms of the Grassmann fields.>>>"
