    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the final answer.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**1. Understand the Problem**\n\nWe are given the 4-point Discrete Fourier Transforms (DFT), `X(k)` and `H(k)`, of two 4-point sequences, `x(n)` and `h(n)`.\n*   `X(k) = [1, j, -1, -j]`\n*   `H(k) = [0, 1+j, 1, 1-j]`\n\nWe need to find the 8-point DFT, let's call it `Y(k)`, of a new 8-point sequence `y(n)` which is formed by interleaving `x(n)` and `h(n)`:\n`y(n) = {x(0), h(0), x(1), h(1), x(2), h(2), x(3), h(3)}`\n\nThis means:\n*   `y(2m) = x(m)` for `m = 0, 1, 2, 3` (even-indexed terms of `y` come from `x`)\n*   `y(2m+1) = h(m)` for `m = 0, 1, 2, 3` (odd-indexed terms of `y` come from `h`)\n\n**2. Relate the 8-point DFT to the 4-point DFTs**\n\nThis problem is a classic application of the decimation-in-time principle used in the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm. The 8-point DFT `Y(k)` can be expressed in terms of the 4-point DFTs `X(k)` and `H(k)`.\n\nThe definition of the 8-point DFT is:\n`Y(k) = sum_{n=0}^{7} y(n) * W_8^{kn}`, where `W_N = e^{-j(2π/N)}` is the twiddle factor.\n\nWe can split the summation into even and odd indices of `n`:\n`Y(k) = sum_{m=0}^{3} y(2m) * W_8^{k(2m)} + sum_{m=0}^{3} y(2m+1) * W_8^{k(2m+1)}`\n\nNow, substitute `y(2m) = x(m)` and `y(2m+1) = h(m)`:\n`Y(k) = sum_{m=0}^{3} x(m) * W_8^{2km} + sum_{m=0}^{3} h(m) * W_8^{k(2m+1)}`\n\nLet's simplify the twiddle factors. Note that `W_8^2 = (e^{-j(2π/8)})^2 = e^{-j(2π/4)} = W_4`.\nThe equation becomes:\n`Y(k) = sum_{m=0}^{3} x(m) * W_4^{km} + W_8^k * sum_{m=0}^{3} h(m) * W_4^{km}`\n\nThe summations are the definitions of the 4-point DFTs `X(k)` and `H(k)`. So, we get the key relationship:\n`Y(k) = X(k mod 4) + W_8^k * H(k mod 4)`\n\nThis formula holds for `k = 0, 1, ..., 7`. We can split this into two parts:\n*   For `k = 0, 1, 2, 3`: `Y(k) = X(k) + W_8^k * H(k)`\n*   For `k = 4, 5, 6, 7`: Let `k = K+4` where `K = 0, 1, 2, 3`.\n    *   `Y(K+4) = X(K) + W_8^{K+4} * H(K)`\n    *   Since `W_8^4 = e^{-j(2π*4/8)} = e^{-jπ} = -1`, we have `W_8^{K+4} = W_8^K * W_8^4 = -W_8^K`.\n    *   So, `Y(K+4) = X(K) - W_8^K * H(K)`\n\n**3. List Careful Points & Required Values**\n\n*   **Periodicity:** `X(k)` and `H(k)` are 4-point DFTs, so they are periodic with period 4. This is handled by the `k mod 4` in the general formula.\n*   **Twiddle Factors:** We need `W_8^k` for `k=0, 1, 2, 3`.\n    *   `W_8^0 = 1`\n    *   `W_8^1 = e^{-j(π/4)} = cos(π/4) - j*sin(π/4) = (1/√2) - j(1/√2) = (1-j)/√2`\n    *   `W_8^2 = e^{-j(π/2)} = -j`\n    *   `W_8^3 = e^{-j(3π/4)} = cos(3π/4) - j*sin(3π/4) = (-1/√2) - j(1/√2) = -(1+j)/√2`\n*   **Complex Arithmetic:** Calculations must be done carefully.\n\n**4. Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\nFirst, let's compute the intermediate term `T(k) = W_8^k * H(k)` for `k = 0, 1, 2, 3`.\n\n*   **k=0:** `T(0) = W_8^0 * H(0) = 1 * 0 = 0`\n*   **k=1:** `T(1) = W_8^1 * H(1) = [(1-j)/√2] * (1+j) = (1-j)(1+j)/√2 = (1 - j²)/√2 = (1 - (-1))/√2 = 2/√2 = √2`\n*   **k=2:** `T(2) = W_8^2 * H(2) = (-j) * 1 = -j`\n*   **k=3:** `T(3) = W_8^3 * H(3) = [-(1+j)/√2] * (1-j) = -(1+j)(1-j)/√2 = -(1 - j²)/√2 = -2/√2 = -√2`\n\nSo, the intermediate sequence `T(k)` is `[0, √2, -j, -√2]`.\n\nNow we can find `Y(k)`.\n\n**For `k = 0, 1, 2, 3` (`Y(k) = X(k) + T(k)`):**\n\n*   `Y(0) = X(0) + T(0) = 1 + 0 = 1`\n*   `Y(1) = X(1) + T(1) = j + √2`\n*   `Y(2) = X(2) + T(2) = -1 + (-j) = -1 - j`\n*   `Y(3) = X(3) + T(3) = -j + (-√2) = -√2 - j`\n\n**For `k = 4, 5, 6, 7` (`Y(k+4) = X(k) - T(k)`):**\n\n*   `Y(4) = X(0) - T(0) = 1 - 0 = 1`\n*   `Y(5) = X(1) - T(1) = j - √2`\n*   `Y(6) = X(2) - T(2) = -1 - (-j) = -1 + j`\n*   `Y(7) = X(3) - T(3) = -j - (-√2) = -j + √2 = √2 - j`\n\n**5. Final Answer**\n\nCombining the results, the 8-point DFT sequence `Y(k)` is:\n`Y(k) = [1, √2+j, -1-j, -√2-j, 1, -√2+j, -1+j, √2-j]`\n\n<<<[1, sqrt(2)+j, -1-j, -sqrt(2)-j, 1, -sqrt(2)+j, -1+j, sqrt(2)-j]>>>"
