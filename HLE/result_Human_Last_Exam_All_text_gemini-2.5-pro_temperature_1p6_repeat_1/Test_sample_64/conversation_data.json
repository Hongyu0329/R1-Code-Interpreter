    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the pitch accent for the word 「弟」.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Word**\nThe word in question is 「弟」. Its reading in hiragana is 「おとうと」 (otouto), which means \"younger brother\".\n\n**Step 2: Break the Word into Morae**\nTo analyze pitch accent, we need to count the morae (the basic rhythmic units of Japanese).\nThe word 「おとうと」 (o-to-u-to) consists of four morae:\n1.  お (o)\n2.  と (to)\n3.  う (u) - This is the long part of the \"o\" sound in \"to\".\n4.  と (to)\n\n**Step 3: Define the Pitch Accent Patterns**\nLet's review the main types of standard Japanese pitch accent for a four-mora word, using \"L\" for low pitch and \"H\" for high pitch, and including the particle 「が」 (ga) to see the full pattern.\n\n*   **A. Heiban (平板式 - \"flat type\")**: The pitch starts low and rises on the second mora. It stays high through the rest of the word and the following particle.\n    *   Pattern: L-H-H-H-H... (e.g., おとうとが)\n*   **B. Atamadaka (頭高式 - \"head-high type\")**: The pitch is high only on the first mora and drops to low for all subsequent morae, including the particle.\n    *   Pattern: H-L-L-L-L...\n*   **C. Nakadaka (中高式 - \"middle-high type\")**: The pitch starts low, rises, and then falls *within* the word. The following particle is low. For a four-mora word, the drop could happen after the second or third mora.\n    *   Pattern (drop after 2nd mora): L-H-L-L-L...\n    *   Pattern (drop after 3rd mora): L-H-H-L-L...\n*   **D. Odaka (尾高式 - \"tail-high type\")**: The pitch starts low, rises on the second mora, and stays high until the end of the word, but then drops on the following particle.\n    *   Pattern: L-H-H-H-L...\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Pitch Accent of 「弟」 (otouto)**\nThe standard (Tokyo) pitch accent for 「弟」 (otouto) is pronounced as follows:\n*   The first mora 「お」 is low.\n*   The pitch rises on the second mora 「と」 and stays high for the rest of the word 「う」 and 「と」.\n*   When a particle like 「が」 is attached, the pitch remains high.\n*   Therefore, the pattern for 「おとうとが」 is: **お(L) と(H) う(H) と(H) が(H)**.\n\n**Step 5: Match the Pattern to the Correct Type**\nComparing the observed pattern (L-H-H-H-H...) with the definitions in Step 3, we can see that it perfectly matches the **Heiban** pattern.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n*   Morae vs. Syllables: Japanese pitch accent is based on morae, not syllables. The long vowel in 「とう」 (tou) counts as two morae (to + u).\n*   Context of \"Standard Japanese\": This question refers to the standard dialect (標準語 - hyōjungo), which is based on the Tokyo accent. Other regions may have different accents for this word.\n*   Comparison with a similar word: The word for \"younger sister\", 「妹」 (いもうと - imouto), has an **Odaka** accent: い(L) も(H) う(H) と(H) が(L). This is a common point of confusion, so it's important to remember that 「弟」 and 「妹」 have different patterns.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe pitch accent pattern for 「弟」 is L-H-H-H..., which is classified as Heiban.\n\n<<<A>>>"
