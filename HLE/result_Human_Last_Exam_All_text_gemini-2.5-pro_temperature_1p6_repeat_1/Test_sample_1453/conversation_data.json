    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Motif:** The question refers to a \"coiled-coil sequence\" and \"knobs-into-holes interactions,\" which are the defining features of this protein structural motif. Coiled-coils consist of two or more alpha-helices wrapped around each other.\n\n2.  **Determine the Heptad Repeat:** The structure and oligomeric state of a coiled-coil are dictated by a repeating pattern of seven amino acids, known as a heptad repeat, designated `(abcdefg)n`. The residues at the `a` and `d` positions are critical as they form the hydrophobic core where the helices pack against each other. These positions are almost always occupied by hydrophobic residues.\n\n3.  **Assign the Heptad Repeat to the Sequence:** We need to find the `a` and `d` positions in the sequence `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG`. Let's look for a repeating pattern of hydrophobic residues (like L, I, A, W, V) at positions `i` and `i+3`.\n    A successful alignment of the sequence to the heptad repeat is as follows (ignoring the flanking N-terminal `GE` and C-terminal `KG` which are likely flexible or capping residues):\n    *   Sequence: `I A Q S L K E` `I A K S L K E` `I A W S L K E` `I A Q S L K G`\n    *   Let's test assigning the large hydrophobic residues to `a` and `d`. If we set the first `I` as `d`, the following `L` becomes `a` of the next repeat. This works perfectly.\n    *   Let's rewrite the sequence aligned to the heptad repeat pattern (`abcdefg`):\n        ```\n          d e f g a b c   d e f g a b c   d e f g a b c   d e f g a b c   d ...\n        G E I A Q S L K E   I A K S L K E   I A W S L K E   I A Q S L K G\n        ```\n    *   Now let's list the residues at the critical `a` and `d` positions from the full sequence:\n        *   **Position `a` residues:** L, L, L, L\n        *   **Position `d` residues:** I, I, W, I, (and an `A` in the first partial heptad if we count it)\n    *   Focusing on the complete repeating core, the pattern is very clear: the `a` positions are exclusively **Leucine (L)**, and the `d` positions are predominantly **Isoleucine (I)**.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Packing Efficiency (Knobs-into-Holes):** The oligomeric state is determined by how well the side chains from the `a` and `d` positions (the \"knobs\") can pack into the spaces (\"holes\") on the adjacent helices.\n    *   **Dimers (State = 2):** In a typical dimer, the `d` position of one helix packs against the `d` position of the other helix (`d-d'` packing). Beta-branched amino acids like Isoleucine (I) and Valine (V) are disfavored at the `d` position in dimers because their branched side chains create steric clashes. Dimers often have Leucine (L) at the `d` position.\n    *   **Trimers (State = 3):** Trimers have a different packing geometry. The `a` positions are buried deep within the core, while the `d` positions are also at the interface but slightly more exposed. This arrangement is particularly stable for sequences that have **Leucine (L) at the `a` position** and a **beta-branched residue like Isoleucine (I) at the `d` position**. The shape of the Isoleucine side chain fits perfectly into the packing interface of a trimer. This L-at-`a` / I-at-`d` pattern is a classic signature for a trimeric coiled-coil.\n    *   **Tetramers (State = 4):** Tetramers often show the reverse pattern of a trimer, with Isoleucine (I) at the `a` position and Leucine (L) at the `d` position.\n    *   **The single Tryptophan (W):** While Tryptophan is very bulky, its presence at a single `d` position does not change the overwhelming preference created by the rest of the sequence (L at `a` and I at `d`), which strongly favors a trimeric structure.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The sequence displays a canonical pattern for a trimeric coiled-coil, with Leucine consistently at the `a` position and Isoleucine predominantly at the `d` position. This combination provides the most efficient and stable knobs-into-holes packing for a three-helix bundle.\n\n<<<B>>>"
