    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the question:** The key elements are: a) a Russian translation of an essay (or an original Russian essay), b) a description of wide boulevards (specifically linking to Vienna), and c) the appearance of an English poet's surname within this description. The final answer must be the surname in English.\n\n2.  **Identify the literary source:** The question points to a well-known passage in Russian literature. The description is not about Vienna itself, but uses the *imagery* of a grand city with wide streets, for which Vienna is a famous example. The text in question is Osip Mandelstam's 1933 essay, \"Journey to Armenia\" («Путешествие в Армению»).\n\n3.  **Locate the specific passage:** In his essay, Mandelstam contrasts the worldview of the naturalist Jean-Baptiste Lamarck with that of Carl Linnaeus. He praises Linnaeus's system of classification, describing it metaphorically as a well-ordered, noble city.\n\n4.  **Analyze the quote:** When describing the metaphorical city of Linnaeus's system, Mandelstam writes: \"Улицы его города достаточно широки, чтобы по ним мог проехать Гёте в карете и чтобы их мог пропеть **Бёрнс**.\"\n\n5.  **Translate and interpret the quote:** The sentence translates to: \"The streets of his city are wide enough for Goethe to ride through in a carriage and for **Burns** to sing them.\"\n\n6.  **Identify the poet:** The surname that appears directly in the Russian text is \"**Бёрнс**\". This is the standard Russian transliteration for the surname of the famous Scottish poet, Robert **Burns**. Scottish poets are often categorized under the general term \"English poets\" in a linguistic or broader cultural sense (poets from the British Isles writing in English).\n\n7.  **Final Conclusion:** The essay is Mandelstam's \"Journey to Armenia.\" The description of \"wide streets\" evokes Viennese boulevards. The surname mentioned is that of the poet Robert Burns.\n\n**Careful points:**\n\n*   The source text is an original Russian essay, not a translation. This is a common slight inaccuracy in such questions.\n*   The reference to Vienna is allusive rather than literal. Mandelstam describes a metaphorical city, and Vienna serves as a perfect real-world archetype for the image of \"wide boulevards.\"\n*   The poet, Robert Burns, is Scottish, but for the purpose of such a question, he falls under the general category of \"English poet\" (as in, a poet who wrote in the English language from Great Britain).\n\n<<<Burns>>>"
