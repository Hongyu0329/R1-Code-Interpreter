    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the partition function.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the System and the Ensemble**\n\n*   **Ensemble:** The system is in the grand canonical ensemble. This means it can exchange both energy and particles with a large reservoir. The ensemble is characterized by temperature T (or inverse temperature $\\beta = 1/k_B T$), volume V, and chemical potential $\\mu$.\n*   **Hamiltonian:** The system's Hamiltonian is given as $\\hat{H} = -\\mu \\hat{N}$, where $\\hat{N}$ is the particle number operator.\n*   **Partition Function:** The grand canonical partition function, $Z$, is defined as the trace over the full Fock space (all possible particle numbers and states) of the operator $e^{-\\beta(\\hat{H}_{sys} - \\mu \\hat{N})}$.\n\n**2. Formulate the Operator in the Partition Function**\n\nThe operator inside the exponential of the partition function is the \"grand canonical Hamiltonian\", $\\hat{K} = \\hat{H}_{sys} - \\mu \\hat{N}$.\nGiven the system Hamiltonian $\\hat{H}_{sys} = -\\mu \\hat{N}$, we can substitute this into the definition:\n$\\hat{K} = (-\\mu \\hat{N}) - (\\mu \\hat{N}) = -2\\mu \\hat{N}$.\n\nSo, the partition function we need to calculate is:\n$Z = \\text{Tr}\\left(e^{-\\beta(-2\\mu \\hat{N})}\\right) = \\text{Tr}\\left(e^{2\\beta\\mu \\hat{N}}\\right)$.\n\n**3. Set up the Path Integral Formalism**\n\nThe partition function $Z$ can be written as a path integral over complex-valued fields $\\psi(x, \\tau)$ (which become Grassmann fields for fermions) that are functions of position $x$ and imaginary time $\\tau \\in [0, \\beta]$.\n$Z = \\int \\mathcal{D}[\\psi^*, \\psi] e^{-S[\\psi^*, \\psi]}$\n\nThe action $S$ in the grand canonical ensemble is given by:\n$S = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d x \\, \\mathcal{L}$\nwhere the Lagrangian density $\\mathcal{L}$ is $\\mathcal{L} = \\psi^* \\partial_\\tau \\psi + H_{sys}(\\psi^*, \\psi) - \\mu \\psi^* \\psi$.\n\n**4. Determine the Action for the Specific System**\n\nThe operator $\\hat{H}_{sys} = -\\mu \\hat{N} = -\\mu \\int d^d x \\, \\hat{\\psi}^\\dagger(x) \\hat{\\psi}(x)$ corresponds to a classical term in the action $H_{sys}(\\psi^*, \\psi) = -\\mu \\psi^* \\psi$.\n\nSubstituting this into the Lagrangian density:\n$\\mathcal{L} = \\psi^* \\partial_\\tau \\psi + (-\\mu \\psi^* \\psi) - \\mu \\psi^* \\psi = \\psi^* (\\partial_\\tau - 2\\mu) \\psi$.\n\nThus, the action for this system is:\n$S = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d x \\, \\psi^*(x, \\tau) (\\partial_\\tau - 2\\mu) \\psi(x, \\tau)$.\n\n**5. Evaluate the Path Integral**\n\nThis action describes a system of non-interacting particles. The operator $(\\partial_\\tau - 2\\mu)$ has no spatial dependence, meaning all single-particle states (e.g., momentum modes) are treated identically. Let's assume there are $N_{sp}$ such single-particle states, indexed by $i$. The field $\\psi$ can be decomposed into modes $\\psi_i$ for each state. The action separates into a sum over these independent modes:\n$S = \\sum_{i=1}^{N_{sp}} \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\, \\psi_i^*(\\tau) (\\partial_\\tau - 2\\mu) \\psi_i(\\tau)$.\n\nBecause the action is a sum of independent terms, the partition function becomes a product of partition functions for each mode:\n$Z = \\prod_{i=1}^{N_{sp}} Z_i$\nwhere $Z_i = \\int \\mathcal{D}[\\psi_i^*, \\psi_i] e^{-\\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\, \\psi_i^*(\\tau) (\\partial_\\tau - 2\\mu) \\psi_i(\\tau)}$.\n\nThis is the standard path integral for a single degree of freedom. Its evaluation depends on the statistics of the particles (bosons or fermions), which dictates the boundary conditions on the fields $\\psi_i(\\tau)$ in imaginary time.\n\n*   **For Bosons:** The fields obey periodic boundary conditions, $\\psi_i(\\beta) = \\psi_i(0)$. The resulting partition function for a single bosonic mode with energy $\\epsilon$ and chemical potential $\\mu'$ is $Z_{Bose} = \\frac{1}{1 - e^{-\\beta(\\epsilon - \\mu')}}$. In our case, the structure of the operator $(\\partial_\\tau - 2\\mu)$ implies an effective single-particle energy $\\epsilon = 0$ and an effective chemical potential $\\mu' = 2\\mu$.\n    Therefore, for each mode $i$:\n    $Z_{i,B} = \\frac{1}{1 - e^{-\\beta(0 - 2\\mu)}} = \\frac{1}{1 - e^{2\\beta\\mu}}$.\n    For the geometric series to converge, we require $|e^{2\\beta\\mu}| < 1$, which implies $2\\beta\\mu < 0$, or $\\mu < 0$.\n\n*   **For Fermions:** The fields obey anti-periodic boundary conditions, $\\psi_i(\\beta) = -\\psi_i(0)$. The partition function for a single fermionic mode is $Z_{Fermi} = 1 + e^{-\\beta(\\epsilon - \\mu')}$. With $\\epsilon = 0$ and $\\mu' = 2\\mu$:\n    $Z_{i,F} = 1 + e^{-\\beta(0 - 2\\mu)} = 1 + e^{2\\beta\\mu}$.\n\n**6. State the Final Result**\n\nThe total partition function is the product of the contributions from all $N_{sp}$ single-particle states. As the question does not specify the particle statistics or the number of states, we provide the general answer.\n\n*   **For a system of Bosons:**\n    $Z = \\prod_{i=1}^{N_{sp}} \\left( \\frac{1}{1 - e^{2\\beta\\mu}} \\right) = \\left( \\frac{1}{1 - e^{2\\beta\\mu}} \\right)^{N_{sp}}$\n    (This result is valid for $\\mu < 0$)\n\n*   **For a system of Fermions:**\n    $Z = \\prod_{i=1}^{N_{sp}} (1 + e^{2\\beta\\mu}) = (1 + e^{2\\beta\\mu})^{N_{sp}}$\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Correct Operator:** The most crucial step is correctly identifying the operator in the grand canonical trace, which is $\\hat{K} = \\hat{H}_{sys} - \\mu \\hat{N}$, not just $\\hat{H}_{sys}$. This leads to the factor of $-2\\mu$.\n2.  **Particle Statistics:** The result of the path integral depends on whether the particles are bosons (periodic boundary conditions) or fermions (anti-periodic boundary conditions). The final answer must distinguish between these two cases.\n3.  **Physical Parameters:** The result depends on $N_{sp}$, the number of available single-particle states, which is an unspecified parameter of the model.\n4.  **Convergence Condition:** For bosons, the resulting geometric series for the partition function only converges if the chemical potential $\\mu$ is negative. This is consistent with the fact that for bosons with a ground state energy of zero, the chemical potential must be less than zero.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe partition function $Z$ depends on the statistics of the particles (Bosons or Fermions) and the total number of single-particle states, $N_{sp}$.\n\nFor a system of **Bosons**:\n$Z = \\left( \\frac{1}{1 - e^{2\\beta\\mu}} \\right)^{N_{sp}}$, which is valid under the condition $\\mu < 0$.\n\nFor a system of **Fermions**:\n$Z = (1 + e^{2\\beta\\mu})^{N_{sp}}$.\n\n<<<The partition function is $Z = (1 + e^{2\\beta\\mu})^{N_{sp}}$ for fermions and $Z = (1 - e^{2\\beta\\mu})^{-N_{sp}}$ for bosons (where $\\mu < 0$), with $N_{sp}$ being the number of single-particle states.>>>"
