    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Starting Material**\nThe starting material is N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide. Let's break down its structure:\n*   **Benzamide:** A benzene ring attached to a carbonyl group which is in turn attached to a nitrogen atom (-C(=O)N-).\n*   **N,N-diethyl:** Two ethyl groups (-CH₂CH₃) are attached to the nitrogen atom of the amide.\n*   **3-dimethylamino:** A dimethylamino group (-N(CH₃)₂) is located at the C3 position (meta position) of the benzene ring, relative to the amide group (which is at C1).\n\nThe structure is a benzene ring with a -C(=O)N(C₂H₅)₂ group at position 1 and a -N(CH₃)₂ group at position 3.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the First Reaction (Reagents: sec-BuLi, TMEDA, THF)**\n*   **sec-BuLi (sec-butyllithium):** This is a very strong organolithium base. Its primary role in this context is to act as a base to deprotonate the most acidic proton in the molecule.\n*   **TMEDA (N,N,N',N'-tetramethylethylenediamine):** This is a bidentate chelating ligand for the lithium cation (Li⁺). It breaks down the aggregates of sec-BuLi and coordinates to the lithium ion, which significantly increases the basicity and reactivity of the organolithium reagent.\n*   **THF (Tetrahydrofuran):** This is a polar aprotic ether solvent that is suitable for organometallic reactions.\n*   **Overall Reaction:** This combination of reagents (a strong alkyllithium base with TMEDA) is characteristic of a **Directed ortho-Metalation (DoM)** reaction. In a DoM reaction, a directing group on an aromatic ring guides the deprotonation (metalation) to a position *ortho* (adjacent) to itself.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Directing Groups and the Site of Lithiation**\nThe starting material has two potential directing groups for ortho-metalation:\n1.  **-C(=O)N(Et)₂ (N,N-diethylamide):** Located at C1. This is one of the most powerful directing groups for DoM. It directs lithiation to the C2 and C6 positions.\n2.  **-N(Me)₂ (dimethylamino):** Located at C3. This is also a strong directing group. It directs lithiation to the C2 and C4 positions.\n\nNow, let's analyze the positions:\n*   The amide group at C1 directs to C2 and C6.\n*   The amino group at C3 directs to C2 and C4.\n\nThe **C2 position** is ortho to *both* directing groups. This is a case of synergistic or cooperating directing groups. The C2 proton is therefore significantly more acidic than any other proton on the ring due to the combined electron-withdrawing inductive effect and the ability of both groups to coordinate with the lithium cation. As a result, sec-BuLi will selectively abstract the proton from the C2 position.\n\n**Careful Point:** The deprotonation will occur at the site activated by both groups, C2, rather than at C6 (activated only by the amide) or C4 (activated only by the amine).\n\nThis first step produces an aryllithium intermediate: N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylamino-2-lithiobenzamide. The lithium atom is at the C2 position.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Second Reaction (Reagent: Methyl Iodide, CH₃I)**\n*   The aryllithium intermediate formed in Step 3 is a powerful nucleophile (a carbanion source).\n*   Methyl iodide (CH₃I) is an electrophile.\n*   The nucleophilic carbon at C2 (bearing the C-Li bond) will attack the electrophilic methyl group of CH₃I in a nucleophilic substitution reaction. The iodide ion (I⁻) acts as the leaving group.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the Final Product**\nThe lithium atom at the C2 position is replaced by a methyl group (-CH₃). The rest of the molecule remains unchanged.\nThe final product's structure has:\n*   An N,N-diethylamide group at C1.\n*   A dimethylamino group at C3.\n*   A newly introduced **methyl group at C2**.\n\nThe name of this compound is **N,N-diethyl-3-(dimethylamino)-2-methylbenzamide**.\n\n<<<N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylamino-2-methylbenzamide>>>"
