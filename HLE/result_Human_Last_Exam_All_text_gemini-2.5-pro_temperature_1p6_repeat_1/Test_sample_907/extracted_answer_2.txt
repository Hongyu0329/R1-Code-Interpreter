**a) No interaction between molecules:**

The absorption cross-section is the incoherent sum of the cross-sections of N individual molecules. It shows a single Gaussian peak at the monomer transition frequency $\omega_0$.
$\sigma^{(a)}_{abs}(\omega_L) = N \left( \frac{\pi \omega_0 |\vec{\mu}_{eg} \cdot \hat{\epsilon}|^2}{\hbar c \epsilon_0} \sqrt{\pi}\sigma_t e^{-(\omega_0-\omega_L)^2 \sigma_t^2} \right)$

**b) Near-neighbor interaction included (Frenkel exciton model):**

The absorption cross-section is dominated by a transition to the collective, delocalized $k=0$ exciton state. This results in a single, cooperatively enhanced Gaussian peak, shifted in energy by the intermolecular coupling $J$.
$\sigma^{(b)}_{abs}(\omega_L) = N \left( \frac{\pi (\omega_0 + 2J/\hbar) |\vec{\mu}_{eg} \cdot \hat{\epsilon}|^2}{\hbar c \epsilon_0} \sqrt{\pi}\sigma_t e^{-[(\omega_0 + 2J/\hbar)-\omega_L]^2 \sigma_t^2} \right)$

Where:
*   $\omega_L$ is the laser carrier frequency.
*   $\omega_0$ is the molecular transition frequency.
*   $\vec{\mu}_{eg}$ is the transition dipole moment of a single molecule.
*   $\hat{\epsilon}$ is the light polarization vector.
*   $\sigma_t$ is the Gaussian pulse duration in time.
*   $N$ is the number of molecules in the chain.
*   $J$ is the near-neighbor coupling energy.
*   $\hbar$ is the reduced Planck's constant, $c$ is the speed of light, and $\epsilon_0$ is the vacuum permittivity.
