    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct Beatles song.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Musical Terminology in the Question\n\nFirst, we need to understand the music theory concepts mentioned in the question:\n*   **Tonic Chord (I):** This is the \"home\" chord of a song's key. It's the chord built on the first note of the scale. For example, in the key of C major, the tonic chord is C major. In the key of A major, the tonic is A major.\n*   **Minor Fifth Chord (v):** This refers to a minor chord built on the fifth degree of the scale. This is a somewhat unusual chord in a major key.\n    *   In a standard major key, the chord built on the fifth degree is a major chord (written as 'V'). For example, in the key of F major, the fifth note is C, and the standard chord is C major (V).\n    *   The question specifies a *minor* fifth chord (written as 'v'). So, in the key of F major, this would be a C minor chord (v).\n*   **Chord Jump:** This implies a direct and prominent chord change.\n*   **\"Starts with\":** This means the progression should occur at the very beginning of the song, likely as part of the introduction or the opening of the first verse.\n\nThe progression we are looking for is a major tonic chord moving directly to a minor dominant chord (I → v). This is a technique called **modal interchange** or **mode mixture**, where a chord is \"borrowed\" from the parallel minor key. For example, in F major, the C minor chord is borrowed from the key of F minor. This creates a distinctive, often melancholic or wistful sound.\n\n### Step 2: Brainstorm and Analyze Beatles Songs\n\nNow, let's go through some famous Beatles songs and analyze their opening chord progressions.\n\n*   **\"A Hard Day's Night\":** Starts with a famous, dissonant G7sus4 chord. This is not a I → v progression.\n*   **\"Yesterday\":** Key of F major. The opening progression is F → Em7 → A7. The tonic is F (I), but the next chord, Em7, is built on the 7th degree of the scale, not the 5th.\n*   **\"Things We Said Today\":** This is a strong candidate. The song has an introductory riff based on an A minor chord. However, the first verse begins with the lyrics \"You say you will...\" over an **A major** chord, which immediately changes to an **E minor** chord on the word \"will\".\n    *   **Key:** A major\n    *   **Tonic (I):** A major\n    *   **Minor Fifth (v):** E minor\n    *   **Progression:** A major → E minor (I → v).\n    *   This perfectly matches the musical criteria, happening at the very start of the verse.\n\n*   **\"And I Love Her\":** This song starts with an acoustic guitar riff. The chords are F# minor → C# minor.\n    *   **Key:** F# minor\n    *   **Tonic (i):** F# minor (a minor tonic is represented by a lowercase 'i')\n    *   **Minor Fifth (v):** C# minor\n    *   **Progression:** F# minor → C# minor (i → v).\n    *   While this is a tonic to minor fifth progression, it's in a minor key (i → v). The question's wording (\"tonic\" and \"minor fifth\") more strongly implies the more unusual borrowing of a minor v chord into a major key context (I → v).\n\n*   **\"Michelle\":** This is another very strong candidate and perhaps the most famous example of this technique in the Beatles' catalog. The song has a short, descending guitar figure based on an F minor chord in the intro. Then, the first verse begins with the iconic line \"Michelle, ma belle...\" sung over an **F major** chord, which then moves to a **C minor** chord.\n    *   **Key:** The song masterfully shifts between F major and F minor, but the verse begins in F major.\n    *   **Tonic (I):** F major\n    *   **Minor Fifth (v):** C minor\n    *   **Progression:** F major → C minor (I → v).\n    *   This also perfectly matches the required progression and happens at the start of the song's main theme.\n\n### Step 3: Compare the Candidates and Final Conclusion\n\nBoth \"Things We Said Today\" and \"Michelle\" contain the I → v chord progression right at the beginning of their main verses.\n\n*   In **\"Things We Said Today\"**, the jump from A major to E minor occurs immediately as the verse starts, following an A minor intro riff.\n*   In **\"Michelle\"**, the jump from F major to C minor also occurs immediately as the verse starts, following a short F minor introductory figure.\n\nHowever, the I → v progression is arguably more central to the identity and famous \"French\" character of **\"Michelle\"**. Paul McCartney consciously used this harmony to create the song's unique, melancholic mood. The transition from F major (\"Michelle, ma belle\") to C minor (\"these are words that go together well\") is the primary musical and emotional hook of the song. While \"Things We Said Today\" also uses the progression effectively, it's the signature sound of \"Michelle\". Therefore, \"Michelle\" is the most fitting answer.\n\n<<<Michelle>>>"
