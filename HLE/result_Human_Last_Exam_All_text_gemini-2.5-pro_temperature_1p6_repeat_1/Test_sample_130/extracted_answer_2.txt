The edges are smoothed out according to their curvature. Specifically, convex boundaries of an object will shrink inwards, and concave boundaries will expand outwards. Over time ($t\rightarrow\infty$), this process will cause any closed boundary to collapse, meaning any finite-sized object (either black or white) will be completely eroded and disappear. The ultimate effect is a simplification of the image geometry, tending towards a final state with minimal boundary length, such as a uniform image.
