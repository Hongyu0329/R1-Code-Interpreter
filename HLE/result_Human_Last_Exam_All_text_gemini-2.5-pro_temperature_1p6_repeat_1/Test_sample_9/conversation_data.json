    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understanding the Space X**\n    Let's first define the space $X$. A nondegenerate lattice in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ is a discrete subgroup of rank 2, which can be generated by two linearly independent vectors $v_1, v_2 \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$. Such a lattice $L$ can be represented by a matrix $M = (v_1|v_2) \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{R})$, where $L = M\\mathbb{Z}^2$.\n    The area of the fundamental parallelogram of the lattice is given by $|\\det(M)|$. The condition of \"unit area\" means we are restricted to matrices $M$ with $|\\det(M)| = 1$. The set of such matrices is $SL^{\\pm}(2, \\mathbb{R}) = \\{M \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{R}) : \\det(M) = \\pm 1\\}$.\n    Two matrices $M_1, M_2$ generate the same lattice if and only if $M_2 = M_1 A$ for some matrix $A \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$, the group of invertible integer matrices (automorphisms of $\\mathbb{Z}^2$).\n    So, the space of all unit-area lattices is the quotient space $SL^{\\pm}(2, \\mathbb{R}) / GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\n    Let's simplify this expression. Every lattice with a basis matrix $M$ of determinant -1 also has a basis matrix $M' = M \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$ with determinant 1. Since $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$, $M$ and $M'$ generate the same lattice. This means every lattice has a basis with determinant +1. Let's call such a basis \"oriented\". The space of oriented bases is $SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$.\n    Two oriented bases $M_1, M_2 \\in SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$ generate the same lattice if $M_2 = M_1 A$ for some $A \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$. Taking determinants, $1 = 1 \\cdot \\det(A)$, so we must have $A \\in SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n    Thus, the space of unit-area lattices is homeomorphic to $SL(2, \\mathbb{R}) / SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$. This space is often denoted as the space of unimodular lattices.\n\n2.  **Interpreting \"Moduli Space\"**\n    The term \"moduli space\" usually implies that objects are identified up to a certain notion of isomorphism. For lattices embedded in $\\mathbb{R}^2$, the natural notion of isomorphism is an isometry of $\\mathbb{R}^2$. An isometry must preserve the area of the lattice, so we consider isometries that fix the origin, which form the group $O(2)$. A general isometry is a rotation or a reflection.\n    However, the area itself is $|\\det(M)|$, which is preserved by any $R \\in O(2)$.\n    A more standard interpretation in this context, particularly in number theory and related fields, is to identify lattices that are equivalent up to rotation ($SO(2)$). This corresponds to considering the \"shape\" of the lattice, removing its orientation in the plane. Let's proceed with this interpretation, which is common for such problems.\n    So, $X = SO(2) \\backslash (SL(2, \\mathbb{R}) / SL(2, \\mathbb{Z}))$.\n\n3.  **Identifying X with a Known Space**\n    The quotient space $X = SO(2) \\backslash SL(2, \\mathbb{R}) / SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ can be identified with a more familiar object.\n    $SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$ acts transitively on the upper half-plane $\\mathcal{H} = \\{z \\in \\mathbb{C} \\mid \\text{Im}(z) > 0\\}$ by MÃ¶bius transformations: $g \\cdot z = \\frac{az+b}{cz+d}$ for $g=\\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    The stabilizer of the point $i \\in \\mathcal{H}$ is the group $SO(2)$.\n    Therefore, we have the identification $\\mathcal{H} \\cong SL(2, \\mathbb{R}) / SO(2)$ (as left coset spaces). Our space $X$ is a quotient by $SO(2)$ on the left, so $X = (SO(2) \\backslash SL(2, \\mathbb{R})) / SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$. This is isomorphic to $\\mathcal{H} / SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$, where $SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ acts on $\\mathcal{H}$ from the left. Note that the center $\\{\\pm I\\}$ of $SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ acts trivially on $\\mathcal{H}$, so the acting group is effectively $PSL(2, \\mathbb{Z}) = SL(2, \\mathbb{Z}) / \\{\\pm I\\}$.\n    So, $X = \\mathcal{H} / PSL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$. This is the famous modular orbifold.\n\n4.  **Computing the Homology**\n    To compute $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z})$, we can use a key result from algebraic topology. If a group $\\Gamma$ acts properly discontinuously on a contractible space $M$, then the homology of the quotient space $M/\\Gamma$ is isomorphic to the group homology of $\\Gamma$. That is, $H_k(M/\\Gamma, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong H_k(\\Gamma, \\mathbb{Z})$. This holds even if the action is not free, if we interpret $H_k(M/\\Gamma, \\mathbb{Z})$ as orbifold homology.\n    In our case, $M = \\mathcal{H}$ is the upper half-plane, which is contractible (homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}^2$). The group is $\\Gamma = PSL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n    So we need to compute $H_1(PSL(2, \\mathbb{Z}), \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\n5.  **Group Homology Calculation**\n    The first homology group of a group $\\Gamma$, $H_1(\\Gamma, \\mathbb{Z})$, is isomorphic to the abelianization of $\\Gamma$, denoted $\\Gamma^{ab} = \\Gamma / [\\Gamma, \\Gamma]$.\n    We need to find the abelianization of $PSL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n    The modular group $PSL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ is known to be isomorphic to the free product of a cyclic group of order 2 and a cyclic group of order 3:\n    $PSL(2, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2 * \\mathbb{Z}_3$.\n    The generators can be taken as the classes of the matrices $S = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$ (which satisfies $S^2 = -I \\equiv I \\pmod{\\{\\pm I\\}}$) and $R=ST = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -1 \\\\ 1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$ (which satisfies $(ST)^3 = -I \\equiv I \\pmod{\\{\\pm I\\}}$).\n    The abelianization of a free product of two groups $G_1 * G_2$ is the direct product of their abelianizations: $(G_1 * G_2)^{ab} \\cong G_1^{ab} \\times G_2^{ab}$.\n    In our case, $G_1 = \\mathbb{Z}_2$ and $G_2 = \\mathbb{Z}_3$.\n    The abelianization of an abelian group is the group itself. So, $(\\mathbb{Z}_2)^{ab} = \\mathbb{Z}_2$ and $(\\mathbb{Z}_3)^{ab} = \\mathbb{Z}_3$.\n    Putting it all together:\n    $H_1(PSL(2, \\mathbb{Z}), \\mathbb{Z}) = (PSL(2, \\mathbb{Z}))^{ab} \\cong (\\mathbb{Z}_2 * \\mathbb{Z}_3)^{ab} \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_3$.\n    By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, $\\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_6$.\n\n6.  **Final Conclusion**\n    The first homology group of the moduli space of nondegenerate lattices in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ with unit area is $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}_6$.\n\nFinal Answer check: This result is standard for the modular orbifold. The chain of reasoning identifies the space in question with this orbifold and then uses standard results about its fundamental group and homology. The interpretation of \"moduli space\" is key, and the one chosen is the most common in contexts where such a question would be asked.\n\nFinal result: $\\mathbb{Z}_6$."
