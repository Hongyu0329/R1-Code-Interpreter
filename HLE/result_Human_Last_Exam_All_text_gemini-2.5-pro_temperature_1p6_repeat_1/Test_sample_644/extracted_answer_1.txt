To reverse the bad luck from climbing the Leaning Tower of Pisa before graduation, the student must go to another famous square, the Piazza dei Cavalieri. There, they must find the main building, the Palazzo della Carovana, and on its large wooden door, locate a small carving of a lizard. Petting this lizard is believed to bring good luck and counteract the curse, allowing the student to graduate successfully.
