    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the specific paper in question:** The question refers to Albert Einstein's 1905 paper on Brownian motion. The official title is \"Über die von der molekularkinetischen Theorie der Wärme geforderte Bewegung von in ruhenden Flüssigkeiten suspendierten Teilchen\" (\"On the Motion of Small Particles Suspended in a Stationary Liquid, as Required by the Molecular-Kinetic Theory of Heat\"). This was one of his four \"Annus Mirabilis\" (Miracle Year) papers.\n\n2.  **Analyze the core argument of Einstein's paper:** Einstein's groundbreaking approach was purely theoretical. He proposed that the random, jittery movement of particles suspended in a fluid (Brownian motion) could be explained as evidence of the existence of atoms and molecules. He connected this motion to the kinetic theory of heat. A crucial step in his derivation was to treat the suspended particles as very large molecules and apply the laws of thermodynamics and statistical mechanics to them.\n\n3.  **Trace the specific theory Einstein used:** To build his argument, Einstein relied on the theory of osmotic pressure. He reasoned that a non-uniform distribution of suspended particles would create a difference in osmotic pressure, leading to a diffusive force that would counteract the tendency of the particles to settle due to gravity.\n\n4.  **Identify the originator of the relevant osmotic pressure theory:** The analogy between the osmotic pressure of dilute solutions and the pressure of ideal gases (van 't Hoff's law) was established by the Dutch chemist **Jacobus Henricus van 't Hoff**. His work was foundational to the field of physical chemistry and earned him the first-ever Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1901.\n\n5.  **Locate the citation in Einstein's work:** This is the most careful point. In the conventions of 1905, citations were not as formalized as they are today. Einstein's paper does not have a formal bibliographic entry citing van 't Hoff. However, the influence is direct and undeniable, as Einstein's argument is explicitly built upon van 't Hoff's law for osmotic pressure. Historians of science have determined that Einstein's likely source for this information was van 't Hoff's influential book, **\"Vorlesungen über theoretische und physikalische Chemie\"**, which translates to **\"Lectures on Theoretical and Physical Chemistry\"**. This book was a published collection of the lectures van 't Hoff had delivered at the University of Berlin. Therefore, by using the concepts detailed in this book, Einstein was effectively \"citing\" van 't Hoff's published lectures.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **\"Cite\" vs. \"Formal Citation\":** The term \"cite\" here is used in a broader sense of intellectual acknowledgement and reliance, not a formal reference in the bibliography section of the paper.\n*   **\"Lectures\" vs. \"Attending Lectures\":** Einstein did not personally attend lectures given by van 't Hoff. He cited the *published form* of these lectures, a common practice at the time where influential lecture series were turned into books.\n*   **Other Influences:** While Ludwig Boltzmann was a massive influence on Einstein's understanding of statistical mechanics in general, the specific theoretical tool of osmotic pressure used in the Brownian motion paper comes directly from van 't Hoff.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBy incorporating the theory of osmotic pressure into his argument, Albert Einstein was building directly upon the work presented in the influential book **\"Lectures on Theoretical and Physical Chemistry\"** by **Jacobus Henricus van 't Hoff**.\n\n<<<Jacobus Henricus van 't Hoff>>>"
