    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of let-7 family members identified in humans.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Question:** The question asks for the total number of members of the \"let-7 family\" of microRNAs (miRNAs) that have been identified in humans to date.\n\n2.  **Define \"Member of a Family\":** In the context of miRNA families, a \"member\" can refer to two things:\n    *   **A unique mature miRNA sequence:** This is the final, functional small RNA molecule.\n    *   **A precursor miRNA gene (pre-miRNA):** This is the gene in the DNA that is transcribed and processed to create the mature miRNA.\n    Since some unique mature miRNAs can be produced from multiple different genes located at different places in the genome, counting the genes is the most precise way to quantify the genetic members of the family. This is the standard convention in the field.\n\n3.  **Identify the Core Members of the let-7 Family:** The let-7 family is named after its founding member, *lin-4* effector-7 (*let-7*), first discovered in *C. elegans*. In humans, the family consists of miRNAs that share a similar \"seed sequence\" (a critical region for target binding). The canonical members are designated let-7a, let-7b, let-7c, let-7d, let-7e, let-7f, let-7g, and let-7i.\n\n4.  **Include Related Members:** Due to its high sequence similarity, particularly in the seed region, **miR-98** is universally considered to be a member of the human let-7 family.\n\n5.  **List and Count the Precursor Genes:** Now we must count the number of genes that encode for these mature miRNAs. We use the official nomenclature from the miRBase database (the primary repository for miRNA data).\n\n    *   **let-7a:** is encoded by three distinct genes.\n        1.  `hsa-let-7a-1`\n        2.  `hsa-let-7a-2`\n        3.  `hsa-let-7a-3`\n    *   **let-7f:** is encoded by two distinct genes.\n        4.  `hsa-let-7f-1`\n        5.  `hsa-let-7f-2`\n    *   **let-7b:** is encoded by one gene.\n        6.  `hsa-let-7b`\n    *   **let-7c:** is encoded by one gene.\n        7.  `hsa-let-7c`\n    *   **let-7d:** is encoded by one gene.\n        8.  `hsa-let-7d`\n    *   **let-7e:** is encoded by one gene.\n        9.  `hsa-let-7e`\n    *   **let-7g:** is encoded by one gene.\n        10. `hsa-let-7g`\n    *   **let-7i:** is encoded by one gene.\n        11. `hsa-let-7i`\n    *   **miR-98:** is encoded by one gene.\n        12. `hsa-mir-98`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Total:** Summing up the number of precursor genes gives the total number of members of the let-7 family in the human genome.\n    Total = 3 (from let-7a) + 2 (from let-7f) + 1 (from let-7b) + 1 (from let-7c) + 1 (from let-7d) + 1 (from let-7e) + 1 (from let-7g) + 1 (from let-7i) + 1 (from miR-98) = **12**.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Gene vs. Mature Sequence:** It is crucial to distinguish between the 12 precursor genes and the 9 unique mature miRNA sequences (let-7a, b, c, d, e, f, g, i, and miR-98) they produce. The number of genes (12) is the standard answer for the size of the genetic family.\n*   **Official Naming:** The numbers are based on the latest annotations in official databases like miRBase. The count has been stable for many years.\n*   **Exclusions:** Some miRNAs like miR-4500 are very distantly related but are not considered part of the core let-7 family. The count of 12 refers to the canonical, universally accepted members.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the counting of the individual precursor miRNA genes, there are 12 members of the let-7 family that have been identified in humans.\n\n<<<12>>>"
