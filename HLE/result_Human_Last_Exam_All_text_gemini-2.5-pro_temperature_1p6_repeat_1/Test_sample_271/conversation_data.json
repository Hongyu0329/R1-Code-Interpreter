    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the solution.\n\n**Step 1: Factor the polynomial**\nLet $f(x) = x^7 - 2 x^5 - 9 x^3 + 3 x^2 + 18 x - 6$.\nWe can try to find common factors among the terms. Notice that the coefficients suggest a relationship with $(x^2-2)$. Let's regroup the terms:\n$f(x) = (x^7 - 2x^5) - (9x^3 - 18x) + (3x^2 - 6)$\n$f(x) = x^5(x^2 - 2) - 9x(x^2 - 2) + 3(x^2 - 2)$\nNow, we can factor out the common term $(x^2 - 2)$:\n$f(x) = (x^5 - 9x + 3)(x^2 - 2)$\n\nSo, the splitting field $K$ of $f(x)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is the compositum of the splitting fields of its irreducible factors, $g(x) = x^2 - 2$ and $h(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the factors and their Galois groups**\nLet's analyze each factor separately.\n*   **For $g(x) = x^2 - 2$**:\n    The roots are $\\pm\\sqrt{2}$. The polynomial is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n    The splitting field is $K_g = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n    The degree of this extension is $[K_g : \\mathbb{Q}] = 2$.\n    The Galois group is $\\text{Gal}(K_g / \\mathbb{Q}) \\cong C_2$ (the cyclic group of order 2).\n\n*   **For $h(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$**:\n    *   **Irreducibility**: We use Eisenstein's criterion with the prime $p=3$.\n        - The leading coefficient 1 is not divisible by 3.\n        - All other coefficients (-9, 0, 0, 3) are divisible by 3.\n        - The constant term 3 is not divisible by $3^2=9$.\n        Therefore, $h(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n    *   **Number of real roots**: We analyze the derivative $h'(x) = 5x^4 - 9$. The critical points are the roots of $h'(x)=0$, which are $x = \\pm\\sqrt[4]{9/5}$. There are two real critical points. This means $h(x)$ can have at most three real roots.\n        Let's evaluate $h(x)$ at integer points:\n        $h(-2) = -32 + 18 + 3 = -11 < 0$\n        $h(-1) = -1 + 9 + 3 = 11 > 0$\n        $h(0) = 3 > 0$\n        $h(1) = 1 - 9 + 3 = -5 < 0$\n        $h(2) = 32 - 18 + 3 = 17 > 0$\n        By the Intermediate Value Theorem, there are three real roots, one in each of the intervals $(-2, -1)$, $(0, 1)$, and $(1, 2)$.\n    *   **Galois group**: A standard theorem in Galois theory states that an irreducible polynomial of prime degree $p$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ which has exactly two non-real roots in $\\mathbb{C}$ has the symmetric group $S_p$ as its Galois group. Here, $p=5$, $h(x)$ is irreducible, and it has 3 real and 2 complex (conjugate) roots.\n        Thus, the Galois group of the splitting field of $h(x)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is $S_5$.\n        Let $K_h$ be the splitting field of $h(x)$. Then $[K_h:\\mathbb{Q}] = |S_5| = 5! = 120$.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Galois group of K over Q**\nThe splitting field $K$ of $f(x)$ is the compositum field $K_g K_h = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\text{roots of } h(x))$. The Galois group $G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$ is the subdirect product of $G_g = \\text{Gal}(K_g/\\mathbb{Q})$ and $G_h = \\text{Gal}(K_h/\\mathbb{Q})$. The group is the direct product $G_g \\times G_h$ if the intersection of the fields is trivial, i.e., $K_g \\cap K_h = \\mathbb{Q}$.\n$K_g = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ is a quadratic extension.\n$K_h$ has Galois group $S_5$. The only subgroup of index 2 in $S_5$ is the alternating group $A_5$. By the fundamental theorem of Galois theory, $K_h$ has a unique quadratic subfield, which is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{D})$, where $D$ is the discriminant of the polynomial $h(x)=x^5-9x+3$.\nThe discriminant is $D = 2^8 a^5 + 5^5 b^4 = 256(-9)^5 + 3125(3)^4 = -15116544 + 253125 = -14863419$.\nSo the unique quadratic subfield of $K_h$ is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-14863419})$. This is an imaginary field, while $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ is a real field. Therefore, they cannot be equal. So, $K_g \\cap K_h = \\mathbb{Q}$.\nThis implies that $G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong G_h \\times G_g \\cong S_5 \\times C_2$.\nThe degree of the extension is $[K:\\mathbb{Q}] = |S_5 \\times C_2| = 120 \\times 2 = 240$.\n\n**Step 4: Find the possible degrees of normal intermediate extensions**\nWe are looking for the degrees of normal field extensions $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ such that $\\mathbb{Q} \\subsetneq L \\subsetneq K$.\nBy the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory, these extensions $L$ are in one-to-one correspondence with the normal subgroups $H$ of $G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$. The condition $\\mathbb{Q} \\subsetneq L \\subsetneq K$ means that the corresponding normal subgroup $H$ must be proper and non-trivial ($H \\neq G$ and $H \\neq \\{e\\}$).\nThe degree of the extension $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is given by the index of the subgroup $H$ in $G$, i.e., $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = [G:H] = |G|/|H|$.\n\nWe need to find all proper non-trivial normal subgroups of $G = S_5 \\times C_2$.\nThe normal subgroups of $S_5$ are $\\{e\\}$, $A_5$, and $S_5$.\nThe normal subgroups of $C_2$ are $\\{e\\}$ and $C_2$.\n\nThe normal subgroups $H$ of a direct product $G_1 \\times G_2$ are not always of the form $N_1 \\times N_2$ where $N_1 \\unlhd G_1$ and $N_2 \\unlhd G_2$, but we can classify them.\n\n1.  **Product subgroups**: $H = N_1 \\times N_2$, where $N_1 \\unlhd S_5$ and $N_2 \\unlhd C_2$.\n    *   $H = S_5 \\times \\{e\\}$: $|H|=120$. Index = $240/120=2$.\n    *   $H = A_5 \\times C_2$: $|H|=60 \\times 2 = 120$. Index = $240/120=2$.\n    *   $H = A_5 \\times \\{e\\}$: $|H|=60$. Index = $240/60=4$.\n    *   $H = \\{e\\} \\times C_2$: $|H|=2$. Index = $240/2=120$.\n    (We exclude $S_5 \\times C_2$ and $\\{e\\} \\times \\{e\\}$ which correspond to $\\mathbb{Q}$ and $K$ respectively).\n\n2.  **Other normal subgroups (\"diagonal\")**: A normal subgroup $H$ of $G_1 \\times G_2$ corresponds to an isomorphism $\\phi: P_1/N_1 \\to P_2/N_2$ where $N_1 \\unlhd P_1 \\unlhd G_1$ and $N_2 \\unlhd P_2 \\unlhd G_2$ are all normal subgroups. Here, $G_1=S_5$ and $G_2=C_2$. The only non-trivial quotient of normal subgroups of $S_5$ is $S_5/A_5 \\cong C_2$. The only non-trivial quotient for $C_2$ is $C_2/\\{e\\} \\cong C_2$.\n    So we can have an isomorphism $\\phi: S_5/A_5 \\to C_2/\\{e\\}$. This gives one more normal subgroup:\n    *   $H = \\{(g, c) \\in S_5 \\times C_2 \\mid \\text{sgn}(g) = c \\}$.\n        (Identifying $S_5/A_5$ and $C_2$ with $\\{\\pm 1\\}$ or $\\{0,1\\}$).\n        This subgroup consists of elements $(g, e)$ for $g \\in A_5$ and elements $(g, c)$ where $g \\notin A_5$ and $c$ is the non-identity element of $C_2$. The order of this subgroup is $|A_5| + |S_5 \\setminus A_5| = 60 + 60 = 120$.\n        The index is $[G:H] = 240/120 = 2$.\n\n**Step 5: Consolidate the degrees**\nThe possible orders for proper non-trivial normal subgroups $H$ are 2, 60, and 120.\nThe corresponding indices (degrees of the extensions $L/\\mathbb{Q}$) are:\n*   For $|H|=120$: $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = 240/120 = 2$.\n*   For $|H|=60$: $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = 240/60 = 4$.\n*   For $|H|=2$: $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = 240/2 = 120$.\n\nThe set of all possible degrees for such extensions $L$ is therefore {2, 4, 120}."
