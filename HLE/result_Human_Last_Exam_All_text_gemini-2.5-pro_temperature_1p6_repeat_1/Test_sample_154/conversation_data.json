    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of 2-vertex-connected simple nonisomorphic graphs with 5 vertices.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Definitions\n\n*   **Simple graph:** A graph with no loops (edges from a vertex to itself) and no multiple edges between the same pair of vertices.\n*   **5 vertices:** The graph has a set of 5 distinct vertices.\n*   **Nonisomorphic:** We are counting unique graph structures. If two graphs can be made identical by just relabeling their vertices, they are considered the same (isomorphic).\n*   **2-vertex-connected (or biconnected):** A graph is 2-vertex-connected if it is connected and remains connected even after removing any single vertex. In other words, the graph has no cut vertices (or articulation points).\n\n### Step 2: Initial Analysis and Constraints\n\nA key property of 2-vertex-connected graphs with more than 2 vertices is that the minimum degree of any vertex, denoted Î´(G), must be at least 2. If a vertex 'v' had a degree of 1, its only neighbor would be a cut vertex (removing this neighbor would isolate 'v').\n\nFor a graph with `n=5` vertices, this means every vertex must have a degree of at least 2. The sum of degrees in a graph is equal to twice the number of edges, `|E|`.\n`Sum of degrees = d1 + d2 + d3 + d4 + d5 >= 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 10`\nSince `Sum of degrees = 2 * |E|`, we have `2 * |E| >= 10`, which implies `|E| >= 5`.\n\nThe maximum number of edges in a simple graph with 5 vertices is the number of edges in a complete graph K5, which is C(5, 2) = (5 * 4) / 2 = 10.\n\nSo, we need to count the number of 2-vertex-connected graphs for `|E|` from 5 to 10.\n\n### Step 3: Enumeration by Number of Edges\n\nWe will systematically count the graphs for each possible number of edges.\n\n**Case |E| = 5:**\n*   The sum of degrees is 10. With the constraint that each vertex has a degree of at least 2, the only possible degree sequence is (2, 2, 2, 2, 2).\n*   The only simple nonisomorphic graph with this degree sequence is the 5-cycle (C5).\n*   Is C5 2-vertex-connected? Yes, removing any single vertex leaves a path of 4 vertices (P4), which is connected.\n*   **Number of graphs = 1.**\n\n**Case |E| = 6:**\n*   The sum of degrees is 12.\n*   We can construct such a graph by adding one edge to C5. In C5, all vertices are equivalent, and adding an edge between any two non-adjacent vertices results in an isomorphic graph. For example, add a \"chord\" to the pentagon.\n*   The resulting graph is 2-vertex-connected because it is a supergraph of the 2-vertex-connected graph C5 (adding an edge between existing vertices to a 2-connected graph cannot create a cut vertex).\n*   **Number of graphs = 1.** (This graph looks like a \"house\" shape).\n\n**Case |E| = 7:**\n*   The sum of degrees is 14. We look for graphs with minimum degree 2. This can be achieved by adding 2 edges to C5 or other constructions. A careful analysis reveals two non-isomorphic graphs:\n    1.  **Graph A (Fan graph F(1,4)):** This graph is formed by a central vertex connected to the other four, which themselves form a path (P4). It can be seen as C5 with two chords originating from the same vertex. Its degree sequence is (4, 3, 3, 2, 2). This graph is 2-vertex-connected.\n    2.  **Graph B:** This graph is formed by C5 plus two non-adjacent, \"crossing\" chords (e.g., in a pentagon labeled 1-2-3-4-5, add chords (1,3) and (2,4)). Its degree sequence is (3, 3, 3, 3, 2). This graph is also 2-vertex-connected.\n*   These two graphs are not isomorphic as their degree sequences are different. Exhaustive analysis shows no other 2-vertex-connected graphs exist with 7 edges.\n*   **Number of graphs = 2.**\n\n**Case |E| = 8:**\n*   The sum of degrees is 16. Again, we find two non-isomorphic graphs that are 2-vertex-connected.\n    1.  **Graph C (The Wheel Graph W5):** This graph has a central vertex connected to the other four vertices, which form a cycle (C4). It is 3-vertex-connected, and therefore also 2-vertex-connected. Its degree sequence is (4, 3, 3, 3, 3).\n    2.  **Graph D:** This graph is K1 + (C3 + P1), meaning a central vertex is connected to four others, which induce a subgraph of a triangle with one tail. Its degree sequence is (4, 4, 3, 3, 2). It is 2-vertex-connected.\n*   These two graphs are not isomorphic (different degree sequences).\n*   **Number of graphs = 2.**\n\n**Case |E| = 9:**\n*   A simple graph with 5 vertices and 9 edges is the complement of a graph with 1 edge. This is the complete graph K5 with one edge removed (K5-e).\n*   All such graphs (K5-e) are isomorphic to each other.\n*   K5 is 4-vertex-connected. Removing an edge can reduce the vertex connectivity by at most 1. So K5-e is at least 3-vertex-connected. Thus, it is 2-vertex-connected.\n*   **Number of graphs = 1.**\n\n**Case |E| = 10:**\n*   The only simple graph with 5 vertices and 10 edges is the complete graph, K5.\n*   K5 is 4-vertex-connected, so it is also 2-vertex-connected.\n*   **Number of graphs = 1.**\n\n### Step 4: Final Tally\n\nTo find the total number of 2-vertex-connected simple nonisomorphic graphs with 5 vertices, we sum the counts from each case:\n*   |E| = 5: 1 graph\n*   |E| = 6: 1 graph\n*   |E| = 7: 2 graphs\n*   |E| = 8: 2 graphs\n*   |E| = 9: 1 graph\n*   |E| = 10: 1 graph\n\nTotal = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 8.\n\n<<<8>>>"
