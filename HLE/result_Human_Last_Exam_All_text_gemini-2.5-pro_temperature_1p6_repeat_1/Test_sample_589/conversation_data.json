    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the core elements of the query.**\nThe question asks to identify a specific Hollywood feature film with several key visual and plot elements:\n*   **Film Type:** A Hollywood feature film.\n*   **Production:** Produced by a major film studio.\n*   **Character:** A teenager.\n*   **Object:** A pink bike.\n*   **Action:** The teenager pedals the bike directly toward an oncoming car.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the key elements for their uniqueness.**\n*   \"Teenager on a bike\" is a common trope in movies, especially from the 1980s (e.g., *E.T.*, *The Goonies*).\n*   \"A pink bike\" is a much more specific detail. It is an unusual color, especially if ridden by a male character, which would make the scene more memorable.\n*   \"Pedaling directly toward an oncoming car\" is a very specific, high-stakes action. It suggests a game of \"chicken,\" a moment of defiance, or a supernatural/horror element.\n\n**Step 3: Combine the unique elements to narrow down possibilities.**\nThe combination of a \"pink bike\" and \"pedaling toward a car\" is a highly specific and memorable scene. This combination is unlikely to appear in many films. We need to search for a film that contains this exact sequence of events.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate potential candidate films.**\n*   ***It* (2017):** This film features teenagers on bikes frequently. However, the most prominent bikes are Bill's \"Silver\" and Beverly's blue bike. There isn't a scene where a character on a pink bike rides *toward* an oncoming car. Mike Hanlon rides away from the bullies' car.\n*   ***Pretty in Pink* (1986):** The title suggests the color pink, but the iconic vehicle is a pinkish Karmann Ghia, not a bike. There is no scene matching the description.\n*   ***A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge* (1985):** This film is a strong candidate.\n    *   **Hollywood feature film by a major studio?** Yes, it was produced by New Line Cinema, a significant studio, especially for the horror genre in the 1980s.\n    *   **Teenager?** Yes, the scene involves the character Grady (played by Robert Rusler), who is a high school teenager.\n    *   **Pink Bike?** Yes. In a notable scene, Grady is riding a distinctive pink girls' Schwinn bicycle.\n    *   **Pedals directly toward an oncoming car?** Yes. The film includes a scene where Grady rides the pink bike head-on toward an approaching car, swerving away at the last possible second to show off. This perfectly matches the action described in the question.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude based on the evidence.**\nThe scene in *A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge* precisely matches all the specific criteria laid out in the question. The character Grady is a teenager, he rides a memorable pink bike, and he deliberately pedals it toward an oncoming car in a game of chicken.\n\n<<<A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge>>>"
