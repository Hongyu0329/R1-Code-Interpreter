    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the computational time complexity of the algorithm `IMAG(n, c)`.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Basic Operations:**\n    The algorithm uses basic arithmetic operations: assignment `(:=)`, division `(/)`, floor function `(⌊...⌋)`, multiplication `(*)`, subtraction `(-)`, addition `(+)`, and comparison `(>)`. In standard complexity analysis (using the uniform cost model), we assume that these operations on numbers that fit within a computer's word size take a constant amount of time, denoted as `O(1)`.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Initialization Step (Step 1):**\n    *   `i := 0;` (1 assignment)\n    *   `x := n;` (1 assignment)\n    *   `q := ⌊x/c⌋;` (1 division, 1 floor, 1 assignment)\n    *   `a_{0} := x — qc;` (1 multiplication, 1 subtraction, 1 assignment)\n    This block of code consists of a fixed number of basic operations. Therefore, its execution time is constant and does not depend on the size of the input `n`. The complexity of this step is **O(1)**.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Loop (Step 2):**\n    *   The algorithm enters a `while` loop that continues as long as the condition `q > 0` is true.\n    *   **Inside the loop (Step 2.1):**\n        *   `i := i + 1;` (1 addition, 1 assignment)\n        *   `x := q;` (1 assignment)\n        *   `q := ⌊x/c⌋;` (1 division, 1 floor, 1 assignment)\n        *   `a_{i} := x — qc;` (1 multiplication, 1 subtraction, 1 assignment)\n    *   Similar to the initialization step, the body of the loop consists of a fixed number of basic operations. The time taken for a single iteration of the loop is constant, i.e., **O(1)**.\n    *   **Number of Iterations:** The total time complexity of the loop depends on how many times it executes. The loop continues as long as `q > 0`. Let's trace the value of `q`.\n        *   Before the loop: `q` is initialized to `⌊n/c⌋`.\n        *   After the 1st iteration: The value of `x` becomes `⌊n/c⌋`, and the new `q` becomes `⌊(⌊n/c⌋)/c⌋`, which is approximately `n/c²`.\n        *   After the 2nd iteration: The new `q` is approximately `n/c³`.\n        *   After `k` iterations: The value of `q` is approximately `n/c^(k+1)`.\n    *   The loop terminates when `q` becomes 0. This occurs when `n/c^k` becomes less than 1 for some `k`.\n        *   `n / c^k < 1  => n < c^k`\n    *   To find `k`, we can take the logarithm with base `c` on both sides:\n        *   `log_c(n) < k`\n    *   This shows that the number of iterations `k` is proportional to `log_c(n)`. The number of iterations is precisely the number of digits in the base-c representation of `n`, minus one. The number of digits is `⌊log_c(n)⌋ + 1`, so the loop runs `⌊log_c(n)⌋` times.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Return Step (Step 3):**\n    *   `return ((a_{i}a_{i - 1}, …, a_{1}  a_{0}))`\n    *   This step involves returning the computed digits. The time to construct and return this sequence is proportional to the number of digits, which we found to be `O(log_c(n))`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Total Complexity:**\n    *   Total Time = (Time for Step 1) + (Time for Loop) + (Time for Step 3)\n    *   Time for Loop = (Number of Iterations) × (Time per Iteration)\n    *   Total Time = `O(1)` + (`O(log_c(n))`) × `O(1)` + `O(log_c(n))`\n    *   Total Time = `O(1)` + `O(log_c(n))` + `O(log_c(n))`\n    *   Total Time = **O(log_c(n))**\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Assumption of O(1) Operations:** The analysis relies on the assumption that arithmetic operations are constant time. This is a standard and reasonable assumption for typical algorithm analysis unless we are dealing with arbitrary-precision arithmetic where the cost of operations depends on the number of bits in the operands.\n*   **Base of the Logarithm:** In Big-O notation, the base of the logarithm does not affect the complexity class because of the change-of-base formula: `log_c(n) = log_b(n) / log_b(c)`. Since `c` is a constant (`c ≥ 2`), `log_b(c)` is also a constant. Constant factors are ignored in Big-O notation. Therefore, `O(log_c(n))` is equivalent to `O(log n)`.\n*   **Dominant Term:** The dominant part of the algorithm is the `while` loop, as its execution time grows with the magnitude of the input `n`, whereas the initialization is constant time.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nThe algorithm essentially divides the input number `n` by the base `c` repeatedly until the result is zero. The number of such divisions determines the number of digits in the base-`c` representation, which is given by `⌊log_c(n)⌋ + 1`. Since the work done in each division step (one loop iteration) is constant, the total complexity is proportional to the number of divisions. Therefore, the computational time complexity is `O(log_c(n))`, which is simplified to `O(log n)`.\n\n<<<O(log n)>>>"
