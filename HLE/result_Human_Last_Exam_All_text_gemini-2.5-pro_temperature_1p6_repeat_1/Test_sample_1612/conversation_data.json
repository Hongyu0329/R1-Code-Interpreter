    "To accurately determine the number of Triple Crown winners in MLB baseball, we need to follow a clear, step-by-step process.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Define the Batting Triple Crown**\nThe first step is to understand what constitutes a \"Triple Crown\" in baseball. The batting Triple Crown is one of the most prestigious and rare achievements for a hitter. To win it, a player must lead their respective league (American League or National League) in all three of the following statistical categories in the same season:\n1.  **Batting Average (AVG)**\n2.  **Home Runs (HR)**\n3.  **Runs Batted In (RBI)**\n\n**Step 2: Identify All Triple Crown-Winning Seasons**\nNext, we need to compile a list of every season in which a player has won the Triple Crown. It's important to list them by league and note that some players have accomplished this feat more than once.\n\n**American League (AL) Triple Crown Winning Seasons:**\n*   **1901:** Nap Lajoie, Philadelphia Athletics\n*   **1909:** Ty Cobb, Detroit Tigers\n*   **1933:** Jimmie Foxx, Philadelphia Athletics\n*   **1934:** Lou Gehrig, New York Yankees\n*   **1942:** Ted Williams, Boston Red Sox\n*   **1947:** Ted Williams, Boston Red Sox\n*   **1956:** Mickey Mantle, New York Yankees\n*   **1966:** Frank Robinson, Baltimore Orioles\n*   **1967:** Carl Yastrzemski, Boston Red Sox\n*   **2012:** Miguel Cabrera, Detroit Tigers\n\n**National League (NL) Triple Crown Winning Seasons:**\n*   **1878:** Paul Hines, Providence Grays\n*   **1887:** Tip O'Neill, St. Louis Browns (in the American Association, which is recognized as a Major League)\n*   **1912:** Heinie Zimmerman, Chicago Cubs\n*   **1922:** Rogers Hornsby, St. Louis Cardinals\n*   **1925:** Rogers Hornsby, St. Louis Cardinals\n*   **1933:** Chuck Klein, Philadelphia Phillies\n*   **1937:** Joe Medwick, St. Louis Cardinals\n\n**Step 3: Count the Total Number of Unique Winners**\nThe question asks for the number of \"winners,\" which means the number of distinct players who have won the Triple Crown, not the total number of times it has been won. To find this, we list each player who won only once.\n\n*   **American League Unique Winners:**\n    1.  Nap Lajoie\n    2.  Ty Cobb\n    3.  Jimmie Foxx\n    4.  Lou Gehrig\n    5.  Ted Williams (won twice, counts as 1 winner)\n    6.  Mickey Mantle\n    7.  Frank Robinson\n    8.  Carl Yastrzemski\n    9.  Miguel Cabrera\n    *Total unique AL winners: 9*\n\n*   **National League Unique Winners:**\n    1.  Paul Hines\n    2.  Tip O'Neill\n    3.  Heinie Zimmerman\n    4.  Rogers Hornsby (won twice, counts as 1 winner)\n    5.  Chuck Klein\n    6.  Joe Medwick\n    *Total unique NL winners: 6*\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Final Total**\nFinally, we add the number of unique winners from each league to get the total number of Triple Crown winners in MLB history.\n\nTotal Winners = (Unique AL Winners) + (Unique NL Winners)\nTotal Winners = 9 + 6 = 15\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Batting vs. Pitching:** The term \"Triple Crown\" in baseball overwhelmingly refers to the batting achievement. There is also a Pitching Triple Crown (leading the league in wins, strikeouts, and ERA), but the question implies the more common batting version.\n*   **Multiple Winners:** Ted Williams and Rogers Hornsby each won the Triple Crown twice. When counting the number of *winners*, they are each counted only once. This is the difference between the 17 times the Triple Crown has been won and the 15 players who have won it.\n*   **19th-Century Records:** The wins by Paul Hines (1878) and Tip O'Neill (1887) are from the 19th century when record-keeping and statistical rules were different. For instance, in 1887, walks were counted as hits, which inflated batting averages. However, Major League Baseball officially recognizes these achievements, so they are included in the final count.\n*   **Question Phrasing:** The question \"How many triple crowns winners are there\" asks for the number of people, not the number of occurrences. The correct answer is the number of unique players.\n\nAfter a thorough step-by-step analysis, we have identified all the unique players who have achieved this rare feat.\n\n<<<15>>>"
