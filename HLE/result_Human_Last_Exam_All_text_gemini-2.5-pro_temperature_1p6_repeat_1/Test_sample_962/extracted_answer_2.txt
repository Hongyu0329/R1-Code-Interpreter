A detailed step-by-step design has been provided above, outlining the setup (DKG) and the two-round signing protocol. The core components are: 1. Using a tightly-secure variant of BLS signatures. 2. A DKG protocol to distribute key shares. 3. A two-round signing protocol where Round 1 is for commitment to partial signatures, and Round 2 is for revealing, verifying the correctness and integrity of each partial signature, and finally combining the valid shares using Lagrange interpolation to produce the final signature.
