    "### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question**\n    The user is asking for the \"maximum generalised hypertreewidth\" for any hypergraph that has exactly 3 hyperedges. Two crucial pieces of information are given:\n    *   The number of hyperedges is fixed at 3.\n    *   The rank of the hypergraph (the maximum size of a hyperedge) is not bounded.\n\n2.  **Clarify the Definition of \"Generalised Hypertreewidth\"**\n    The term \"hypertreewidth\" can refer to several related concepts. The most common ones are:\n    *   **htw (vertex-bags):** The width is based on the number of *vertices* in the bags of the tree decomposition. If this definition were used, the fact that the rank is unbounded means we could construct hypergraphs with arbitrarily large vertex bags (by making hyperedges and their intersections large). The hypertreewidth would not be a single fixed number, which contradicts the implicit assumption of the question.\n    *   **ghtw (edge-bags):** The width is based on the number of *hyperedges* in the bags of the tree decomposition. This width is naturally bounded by the total number of hyperedges in the hypergraph. This fits the structure of the question, as it leads to a fixed numerical answer. We will proceed with this definition, which is standard in the literature (e.g., in the work of Gottlob et al.).\n\n    **Definition of ghtw (Generalised Hypertreewidth):**\n    A g-tree decomposition of a hypergraph $H=(V, E)$ is a pair $(T, \\lambda)$, where $T$ is a tree and $\\lambda$ is a function mapping each node $t$ of the tree to a set of hyperedges $\\lambda(t) \\subseteq E$. The decomposition must satisfy:\n    1.  **Edge Connectivity Property:** For every hyperedge $e \\in E$, the set of tree nodes $\\{t \\in V(T) \\mid e \\in \\lambda(t)\\}$ is non-empty and connected in $T$.\n    2.  **Vertex Covering Property:** For every vertex $v \\in V$, there is a tree node $t \\in V(T)$ such that all hyperedges containing $v$ are in the bag $\\lambda(t)$. Let $E_v = \\{e \\in E \\mid v \\in e\\}$, then this property says $\\exists t \\in V(T): E_v \\subseteq \\lambda(t)$.\n\n    The **width** of the decomposition is $\\max_{t \\in V(T)} |\\lambda(t)|$.\n    The **ghtw(H)** is the minimum width over all possible g-tree decompositions.\n\n3.  **Establish an Upper Bound for the Maximum ghtw**\n    Let $H = (V, E)$ be any hypergraph with 3 hyperedges, so $E = \\{e_1, e_2, e_3\\}$. We can always construct a simple g-tree decomposition for $H$:\n    *   Let the tree $T$ consist of a single node, $t_0$.\n    *   Define the bag for this node as $\\lambda(t_0) = E = \\{e_1, e_2, e_3\\}$.\n\n    Let's check if this is a valid decomposition:\n    *   **Edge Connectivity:** For any edge $e \\in E$, the set of nodes containing it is just $\\{t_0\\}$, which is a connected subtree. This property holds.\n    *   **Vertex Covering:** For any vertex $v \\in V$, its set of incident edges $E_v$ is a subset of $E$. We need a node $t$ where $E_v \\subseteq \\lambda(t)$. We can choose $t=t_0$, and since $E_v \\subseteq E = \\lambda(t_0)$, this property holds.\n\n    The width of this decomposition is $|\\lambda(t_0)| = |E| = 3$.\n    Since the `ghtw(H)` is the *minimum* width over all decompositions, it must be less than or equal to the width of this specific decomposition.\n    Therefore, for any hypergraph $H$ with 3 hyperedges, `ghtw(H) <= 3`. This means the maximum possible ghtw is at most 3.\n\n4.  **Establish a Lower Bound by Constructing a \"Worst-Case\" Hypergraph**\n    To show that the maximum is exactly 3, we need to find at least one hypergraph $H^*$ with 3 hyperedges that has `ghtw(H^*) = 3`.\n    A `ghtw` of 3 means that *every* possible g-tree decomposition of $H^*$ must have a width of at least 3. Since we know the width cannot exceed 3, this means every decomposition must have a bag of size exactly 3.\n\n    Let's construct such a hypergraph $H^*=(V, E)$ with $E = \\{e_1, e_2, e_3\\}$.\n    Let's define $H^*$ to have at least one vertex that is a member of all three hyperedges. For instance, let's create a vertex $v^*$ such that $v^* \\in e_1 \\cap e_2 \\cap e_3$. Such a hypergraph is easy to imagine, e.g., $e_1=\\{v^*, a\\}$, $e_2=\\{v^*, b\\}$, $e_3=\\{v^*, c\\}$.\n\n    Now, consider any g-tree decomposition $(T, \\lambda)$ for this hypergraph $H^*$.\n    *   By the **Vertex Covering Property**, for our specific vertex $v^*$, there must exist some node $t$ in the tree $T$ such that its bag $\\lambda(t)$ contains all edges incident to $v^*$.\n    *   The set of edges incident to $v^*$ is $E_{v^*} = \\{e \\in E \\mid v^* \\in e\\} = \\{e_1, e_2, e_3\\}$.\n    *   Therefore, for any decomposition, there must be a bag $\\lambda(t)$ such that $\\{e_1, e_2, e_3\\} \\subseteq \\lambda(t)$.\n    *   Since bags are subsets of $E$, we must have $\\lambda(t) = \\{e_1, e_2, e_3\\}$.\n    *   This means that in any valid g-tree decomposition of $H^*$, there is at least one bag of size 3.\n    *   The width of any decomposition is therefore at least 3.\n    *   This implies that `ghtw(H^*) >= 3`.\n\n5.  **Conclusion**\n    From step 3, we know that for any hypergraph $H$ with 3 hyperedges, `ghtw(H) <= 3`.\n    From step 4, we found a specific hypergraph $H^*$ for which `ghtw(H^*) >= 3`.\n    Combining these two facts, we conclude that `ghtw(H^*) = 3`.\n    Since we have found a hypergraph that achieves the upper bound of 3, the maximum possible generalised hypertreewidth for a hypergraph with 3 hyperedges is 3.\n\n<<<3>>>"
