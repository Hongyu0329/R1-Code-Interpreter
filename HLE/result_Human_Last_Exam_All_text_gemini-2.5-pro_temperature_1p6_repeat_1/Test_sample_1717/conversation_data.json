    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Establish Base Health:**\n    *   First, we need the base health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode for a single player.\n    *   In Normal Mode, the boss has 2,800 health.\n    *   In Expert Mode, its health is increased to 3,640. This will be our base value.\n\n2.  **Determine the Health Scaling Formula:**\n    *   The question requires us to consider the multiplayer health scaling mechanic in Expert Mode.\n    *   According to the Terraria source code, boss health in Expert Mode scales with the number of players (let's call this `N`). The formula used is:\n        `Total Health = BaseHealth * (1 + 0.35 * (N - 1))`\n    *   Substituting the Eye of Cthulhu's Expert Mode base health, we get:\n        `Total Health = 3640 * (1 + 0.35 * (N - 1))`\n\n3.  **Analyze the Formula with an Infinite Number of Players:**\n    *   The question asks for the theoretical maximum health given an *infinite* number of players (`N → ∞`).\n    *   Let's analyze the formula from a purely mathematical perspective. The formula `3640 * (1 + 0.35N - 0.35)` simplifies to the linear function `Health(N) = 1274 * N + 2366`.\n    *   As `N` approaches infinity, this function also approaches infinity. This means there is no *mathematical* maximum.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Constraints of the Source Code:**\n    *   The key to the question is the phrase \"According to the source code\". This directs us to look beyond the math and into the technical limitations of the game's engine.\n    *   In programming, numbers are stored in variables of a specific data type, and each data type has a maximum value it can hold.\n    *   By examining Terraria's source code (`Terraria.NPC`), we can see that an NPC's health is stored in a variable named `lifeMax`. This variable is a 32-bit signed integer (an `int` in the C# language).\n\n5.  **Identify the Technical Limit:**\n    *   A 32-bit signed integer can store values from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647.\n    *   Therefore, the highest positive value the `lifeMax` variable can possibly be set to is **2,147,483,647**.\n    *   Although the health scaling formula would produce infinitely large numbers with infinite players, the game engine is incapable of storing a health value beyond this technical limit. Any attempt to assign a larger value would result in an \"integer overflow\", which either clamps the value at the maximum or wraps it around to a negative number, likely causing a crash or bug.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe phrase \"infinite number of players\" is a way of asking what the ultimate ceiling for the health value is, pushing past any normal gameplay scenario. While the scaling formula itself has no upper bound, the variable that stores the health in the game's code does. This data type limit is the true \"theoretical maximum\".\n\nThe theoretical maximum health for any entity in Terraria, including the Eye of Cthulhu, is dictated by the maximum value of a 32-bit signed integer.\n\n<<<2147483647>>>"
