    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### **Step 1: Understand the Functions**\nWe are given a sequence of functions defined recursively:\n*   `F₀(x) = x`\n*   `F₁(x) = sin(F₀(x)) = sin(x)`\n*   `F₂(x) = e^(F₁(x)) = e^(sin(x))`\n*   `F₃(x) = ln(1 + F₂(x)) = ln(1 + e^(sin(x)))`\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Integral**\nThe integral we need to evaluate is:\n`V = ∫ (F₃'(x) / F₃(x)) dx` from `x = 0` to `x = 1`.\n\nThe integrand `F₃'(x) / F₃(x)` is a special form. If we let `u = F₃(x)`, then `du = F₃'(x) dx`. The integral becomes `∫ (1/u) du`, whose antiderivative is `ln|u|`.\n\nSo, the antiderivative of `F₃'(x) / F₃(x)` is `ln|F₃(x)|`.\n\n### **Step 3: Apply the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus**\nUsing the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, we can evaluate the definite integral:\n`V = [ln|F₃(x)|] from 0 to 1`\n`V = ln|F₃(1)| - ln|F₃(0)|`\n\nUsing the property of logarithms `ln(a) - ln(b) = ln(a/b)`, this becomes:\n`V = ln(|F₃(1)| / |F₃(0)|)`\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the Function F₃(x)**\nLet's analyze `F₃(x) = ln(1 + e^(sin(x)))` on the interval `[0, 1]`.\n*   For `x` in `[0, 1]`, `sin(x)` ranges from `sin(0) = 0` to `sin(1) ≈ 0.841`.\n*   Since `sin(x) ≥ 0` on this interval, `e^(sin(x)) ≥ e⁰ = 1`.\n*   Therefore, `1 + e^(sin(x)) ≥ 1 + 1 = 2`.\n*   This means `F₃(x) = ln(1 + e^(sin(x))) ≥ ln(2)`.\n*   Since `ln(2)` is positive, `F₃(x)` is always positive on the interval `[0, 1]`. We can therefore remove the absolute value signs.\n\nThe expression for V simplifies to:\n`V = ln(F₃(1) / F₃(0))`\n\n### **Step 5: Calculate F₃(0) and F₃(1)**\n*   **Calculate F₃(0):**\n    `F₃(0) = ln(1 + e^(sin(0))) = ln(1 + e⁰) = ln(1 + 1) = ln(2)`\n*   **Calculate F₃(1):**\n    `F₃(1) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))` (Note: '1' is in radians)\n\n### **Step 6: Substitute and Find the Value of V**\nNow, substitute the expressions for F₃(0) and F₃(1) back into the equation for V:\n`V = ln( [ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))] / [ln(2)] )`\n\n### **Step 7: Numerical Calculation**\nWe need to calculate the numerical value of V and then find the closest integer to `10000 * V`.\n*   `sin(1 radian) ≈ 0.841471`\n*   `e^(sin(1)) ≈ e^(0.841471) ≈ 2.319771`\n*   `1 + e^(sin(1)) ≈ 3.319771`\n*   `ln(1 + e^(sin(1))) ≈ ln(3.319771) ≈ 1.200021` (This is `F₃(1)`)\n*   `ln(2) ≈ 0.693147` (This is `F₃(0)`)\n\nNow, calculate the ratio inside the main logarithm:\n`F₃(1) / F₃(0) ≈ 1.200021 / 0.693147 ≈ 1.731293`\n\nFinally, calculate V:\n`V = ln(1.731293) ≈ 0.548864`\n\n### **Step 8: Final Answer Calculation**\nThe question asks for the closest integer to `10000 * V`.\n`10000 * V ≈ 10000 * 0.548864 = 5488.64`\nThe closest integer to `5488.64` is **5489**.\n\n### **List of Careful Points**\n1.  **Recognize the Integral Form:** The key insight is that `∫(f'(x)/f(x))dx = ln|f(x)| + C`.\n2.  **Angle Units:** The argument of the sine function is `x`, which is in radians since it's the variable of integration. So `sin(1)` is sine of 1 radian.\n3.  **Domain of Logarithm:** Ensure that the argument of the logarithm, `F₃(x)`, is positive over the integration interval to correctly handle the absolute value.\n4.  **Order of Operations:** The final expression `V = ln( [ln(...)] / [ln(...)] )` has nested logarithms. It is crucial to calculate the inner values `F₃(1)` and `F₃(0)` first, then their ratio, and finally the natural logarithm of that ratio.\n5.  **Final Calculation:** The final step is not just `V`, but `10000 * V` rounded to the nearest integer.\n\nThe step-by-step analysis leads to the final value.\n\n<<<5489>>>"
