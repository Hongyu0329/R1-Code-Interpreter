    "This problem asks for the number of \"power subgroups\" in the generalized quaternion group of size 128. A power subgroup is another name for a cyclic subgroup, which is a subgroup generated by a single element.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n**1. Understand the Group Structure**\nThe generalized quaternion group of size 128 is denoted as $Q_{128}$ or $Q_{2^7}$. Its presentation is given by:\n$Q_{128} = \\langle x, y \\mid x^{64} = 1, y^2 = x^{32}, y^{-1}xy = x^{-1} \\rangle$\n*   The order of the group is 128.\n*   The elements of the group can be partitioned into two sets:\n    *   The set $A = \\langle x \\rangle = \\{x^k \\mid 0 \\le k < 64\\}$, which is a cyclic subgroup of order 64.\n    *   The coset $yA = \\{yx^k \\mid 0 \\le k < 64\\}$, which contains the remaining 64 elements.\n\n**2. Identify the Task**\nWe need to find the number of distinct cyclic subgroups of $Q_{128}$. We can find these by considering the subgroups generated by elements from $A$ and from $yA$ separately.\n\n**3. Count the Cyclic Subgroups within $A = \\langle x \\rangle$**\nThe subgroup $A = \\langle x \\rangle$ is a cyclic group of order 64. For any finite cyclic group $C_m$, the number of subgroups is equal to the number of divisors of its order $m$.\n*   The order is $m = 64 = 2^6$.\n*   The divisors of 64 are $1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64$.\n*   The number of divisors is $\\tau(64) = 6+1=7$.\n*   For each divisor $d$ of 64, there is exactly one subgroup of order $d$ in $\\langle x \\rangle$, which is $\\langle x^{64/d} \\rangle$.\n*   These 7 subgroups are: $\\langle x^{64} \\rangle = \\{1\\}$, $\\langle x^{32} \\rangle$, $\\langle x^{16} \\rangle$, $\\langle x^8 \\rangle$, $\\langle x^4 \\rangle$, $\\langle x^2 \\rangle$, and $\\langle x \\rangle$.\n\nSo, there are **7** cyclic subgroups contained entirely within $\\langle x \\rangle$.\n\n**4. Count the Cyclic Subgroups Generated by Elements in $yA$**\nNow, consider the elements not in $\\langle x \\rangle$, which are all of the form $g = yx^k$ for $k \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, 63\\}$.\n*   First, let's determine the order of these elements. We compute the square of $g$:\n    $g^2 = (yx^k)^2 = (yx^k)(yx^k) = y(x^k y)x^k$\n    Using the relation $x^ky = yx^{-k}$ (which comes from $y^{-1}xy = x^{-1}$), we get:\n    $g^2 = y(yx^{-k})x^k = y^2x^{-k}x^k = y^2$\n    From the group presentation, we know $y^2 = x^{32}$. So, $g^2 = x^{32}$.\n*   The order of $x^{32}$ is $\\frac{64}{\\text{gcd}(32, 64)} = \\frac{64}{32} = 2$.\n*   Since $g^2 = x^{32} \\neq 1$, the order of $g$ is not 1 or 2.\n*   Let's compute $g^4$: $g^4 = (g^2)^2 = (x^{32})^2 = x^{64} = 1$.\n*   Since $g^4=1$ and $g^2 \\ne 1$, the order of every element $g = yx^k$ is exactly 4.\n*   There are 64 such elements in the coset $yA$, and they all have order 4. Each one generates a cyclic subgroup of order 4. We need to find how many of these subgroups are distinct.\n*   A cyclic group of order 4 has $\\phi(4) = 2$ generators. ($\\phi$ is Euler's totient function).\n*   If a subgroup is generated by $g$, its other generator is $g^3$.\n*   Let's find $g^3$: $g^3 = g^2 \\cdot g = x^{32}yx^k$. Using the relation $x^{32}y = yx^{-32} = yx^{32}$, we get $g^3 = yx^{32}x^k = yx^{k+32}$.\n*   So, the two generators of the subgroup $\\langle yx^k \\rangle$ are $yx^k$ and $yx^{k+32}$. This means $\\langle yx^k \\rangle = \\langle yx^{k+32} \\rangle$.\n*   The 64 elements of order 4 are partitioned into pairs, with each pair generating the same subgroup.\n*   The number of distinct cyclic subgroups is the total number of these generators (64) divided by the number of generators per subgroup (2).\n*   Number of subgroups = $64 / 2 = 32$.\n\nSo, there are **32** distinct cyclic subgroups of order 4 generated by elements from the coset $yA$.\n\n**5. Calculate the Total Number of Power Subgroups**\nThe total number of cyclic subgroups is the sum of the counts from Step 3 and Step 4. The two sets of subgroups are disjoint because one set is entirely contained within $\\langle x \\rangle$ while the generators for the other set are outside $\\langle x \\rangle$.\nTotal number = (cyclic subgroups in $\\langle x \\rangle$) + (cyclic subgroups generated by elements in $yA$)\nTotal number = $7 + 32 = 39$.\n\nFinal Answer Calculation Summary:\n*   Cyclic subgroups of $\\langle x \\rangle \\cong C_{64}$: $\\tau(64) = 7$.\n*   Cyclic subgroups generated by elements outside $\\langle x \\rangle$: $64 / \\phi(4) = 64/2 = 32$.\n*   Total Power Subgroups = $7 + 32 = 39$.\n\n<<<39>>>"
