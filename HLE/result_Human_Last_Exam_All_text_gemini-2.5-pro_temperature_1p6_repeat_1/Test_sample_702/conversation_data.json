    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the connectivity of the map.\n\n**1. Understand the Question**\n\nWe need to find the connectivity of the map `f: Σ(ΩS⁴ ∧ ΩS⁶) → Ω(S⁴ ∧ S⁶)`.\nThe connectivity of a map `f: X → Y` is the integer `k` such that the induced map on homotopy groups, `f_*: π_i(X) → π_i(Y)`, is an isomorphism for all `i < k` and a surjection for `i = k`. This is equivalent to the homotopy fiber of `f` being `(k-1)`-connected.\n\n**2. Identify the Spaces**\n\n*   **Domain (D):** `D = Σ(ΩS⁴ ∧ ΩS⁶)`\n*   **Target (T):** `T = Ω(S⁴ ∧ S⁶) = Ω(S¹⁰)`.\n\n**3. Determine the Connectivity of the Domain and Target Spaces**\n\nThe connectivity of a space `X` is the largest integer `c` such that `π_i(X) = 0` for all `i ≤ c`.\n\n*   **Connectivity of Loop Spaces:** A sphere `Sⁿ` is `(n-1)`-connected. Its loop space `ΩSⁿ` is `(n-2)`-connected.\n    *   `conn(ΩS⁴) = 4 - 2 = 2`. `ΩS⁴` is 2-connected.\n    *   `conn(ΩS⁶) = 6 - 2 = 4`. `ΩS⁶` is 4-connected.\n\n*   **Connectivity of the Smash Product:** For CW-complexes `A` and `B` with `conn(A)=c_A` and `conn(B)=c_B`, the smash product `A ∧ B` is `(c_A + c_B + 1)`-connected.\n    *   Let `X = ΩS⁴ ∧ ΩS⁶`.\n    *   `conn(X) = conn(ΩS⁴) + conn(ΩS⁶) + 1 = 2 + 4 + 1 = 7`.\n    *   So, `ΩS⁴ ∧ ΩS⁶` is 7-connected, meaning `π_i(X) = 0` for `i ≤ 7`. This is confirmed by checking the homology: `H_*(ΩS⁴) = ℤ[x₃]` and `H_*(ΩS⁶) = ℤ[y₅]`. The lowest degree term in `H_*(X) = H_*(ΩS⁴) ⊗ H_*(ΩS⁶)` is `x₃ ⊗ y₅` of degree `3+5=8`. Thus, by Hurewicz theorem, `X` is 7-connected.\n\n*   **Connectivity of the Domain (D):** `D = ΣX = Σ(ΩS⁴ ∧ ΩS⁶)`. Since `X` is simply-connected (in fact, 7-connected), suspension does not change the connectivity.\n    *   `conn(D) = conn(X) = 7`. `D` is 7-connected.\n\n*   **Connectivity of the Target (T):** `T = ΩS¹⁰`.\n    *   `conn(T) = 10 - 2 = 8`. `T` is 8-connected. (Note: `S^{10}` is 9-connected, so `ΩS^{10}` is 8-connected. Let's be precise, `π_i(ΩS^{10})=0` for `i \\leq 8`).\n\n**4. Analyze the Map on Homotopy Groups (Step-by-Step)**\n\nWe check the map `f_*: π_i(D) → π_i(T)` for increasing values of `i`.\n\n*   **For `i ≤ 7`:** `π_i(D) = 0` and `π_i(T) = 0`. The map `0 → 0` is an isomorphism.\n*   **For `i = 8`:**\n    *   `π_8(D) = π_7(X) = 0`, since `X` is 7-connected.\n    *   `π_8(T) = π_8(ΩS¹⁰) = π_9(S¹⁰) = 0` (from tables of homotopy groups of spheres).\n    *   The map `0 → 0` is an isomorphism. The connectivity is at least 9.\n\n*   **For `i = 9`:**\n    *   `π_9(D) = π_8(X)`. Since `X` is 7-connected, the Hurewicz theorem applies: `π_8(X) ≅ H_8(X)`.\n    *   `H_8(X) = H_8(ΩS⁴ ∧ ΩS⁶) ≅ H_3(ΩS⁴) ⊗ H_5(ΩS⁶) ≅ ℤ ⊗ ℤ = ℤ`. So `π_9(D) ≅ ℤ`.\n    *   `π_9(T) = π_9(ΩS¹⁰) = π_{10}(S¹⁰) ≅ ℤ`.\n    *   The map `f_*: π_9(D) → π_9(T)` is a homomorphism `ℤ → ℤ`. The map in question is a fundamental map related to James-Hopf invariants, and it is a known (and non-trivial) result that this map is an isomorphism (it maps a generator to a generator).\n    *   Since `f_*` is an isomorphism on `π_9`, the connectivity is at least 10.\n\n*   **For `i = 10`:**\n    *   `π_{10}(D) = π_9(X)`. Again by Hurewicz, `π_9(X) ≅ H_9(X)`.\n    *   `H_9(X) = H_9(ΩS⁴ ∧ ΩS⁶) ≅ H_9(ΩS⁴) ⊗ H_0(ΩS⁶) ≅ ℤ ⊗ ℤ = ℤ`. So `π_{10}(D) ≅ ℤ`.\n    *   `π_{10}(T) = π_{10}(ΩS¹⁰) = π_{11}(S¹⁰)`. From the stable homotopy groups of spheres, `π_{n+1}(S^n) ≅ ℤ₂` for `n ≥ 3`. So, `π_{11}(S¹⁰) ≅ ℤ₂`.\n    *   The map `f_*: π_{10}(D) → π_{10}(T)` is a homomorphism `ℤ → ℤ₂`.\n    *   This map is also known to be non-trivial, meaning it is the canonical projection. A non-zero homomorphism from `ℤ` to `ℤ₂` must be surjective.\n    *   However, it is not injective (its kernel is `2ℤ`). Thus, `f_*` on `π_{10}` is a surjection but not an isomorphism.\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n\n*   `f_*: π_i(D) → π_i(T)` is an isomorphism for `i < 10`.\n*   `f_*: π_{10}(D) → π_{10}(T)` is a surjection.\n\nBy the definition of connectivity of a map, the connectivity of `f` is 10.\n\n<<<10>>>"
