    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the probability of finding the particle within the specified interval.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the System and State the Relevant Equations**\n\nThe problem involves a particle in a one-dimensional (1D) box of length `a`. We need to find the probability of locating this particle in a specific small interval.\n\n*   The normalized wavefunction for a particle in a 1D box is given by:\n    $Ïˆ_n(x) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{a}} \\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{a}\\right)$\n    where `n` is the principal quantum number (the energy level), `a` is the length of the box, and `x` is the position within the box (from 0 to a).\n\n*   The probability density, $P(x)$, which gives the probability per unit length of finding the particle at position `x`, is the square of the magnitude of the wavefunction:\n    $P(x) = |\\psi_n(x)|^2 = \\frac{2}{a} \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{a}\\right)$\n\n*   The probability of finding the particle in a given interval from $x_1$ to $x_2$ is found by integrating the probability density over that interval:\n    Probability = $\\int_{x_1}^{x_2} P(x) \\,dx = \\int_{x_1}^{x_2} \\frac{2}{a} \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{a}\\right) \\,dx$\n\n**Step 2: Apply the Specific Conditions of the Problem**\n\nWe are given the following conditions:\n*   Energy level, `n = 2`\n*   Interval start, $x_1 = 0.495a$\n*   Interval end, $x_2 = 0.505a$\n\nSubstituting `n = 2` into the probability integral:\nProbability = $\\int_{0.495a}^{0.505a} \\frac{2}{a} \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x}{a}\\right) \\,dx$\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Interval and Choose a Method**\n\nThe interval is from $0.495a$ to $0.505a$.\n*   The center of the interval is at $x = 0.5a$.\n*   The length of the interval is $\\Delta x = 0.505a - 0.495a = 0.01a$.\n\nSince the interval is very small ($\\Delta x \\ll a$), we can use an approximation. A simple approximation would be Probability $\\approx P(x_{center}) \\times \\Delta x$. However, for n=2, the probability density at the center of the box ($x=0.5a$) is:\n$P(0.5a) = \\frac{2}{a} \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{2\\pi (0.5a)}{a}\\right) = \\frac{2}{a} \\sin^2(\\pi) = 0$\nThis means there is a node at the center of the interval. The simple approximation gives a probability of 0, which is inaccurate because the probability is non-zero away from the center.\n\nA more accurate method is to approximate the function near the center and then integrate.\n\n**Step 4: Approximate the Probability Density Function**\n\nWe can perform a Taylor series expansion of the probability density function, $P(x) = \\frac{2}{a} \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x}{a}\\right)$, around the center of the interval, $x_c = 0.5a$.\n\nLet's define a new variable $y = x - 0.5a$, so $x = y + 0.5a$. The integration limits for $y$ become:\n*   Lower limit: $0.495a - 0.5a = -0.005a$\n*   Upper limit: $0.505a - 0.5a = +0.005a$\n\nNow, substitute $x = y + 0.5a$ into the integrand:\n$\\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x}{a}\\right) = \\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi (y + 0.5a)}{a}\\right) = \\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi y}{a} + \\pi\\right)$\n\nUsing the trigonometric identity $\\sin(\\theta + \\pi) = -\\sin(\\theta)$, we get:\n$\\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi y}{a} + \\pi\\right) = -\\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi y}{a}\\right)$\nTherefore, the term $\\sin^2\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x}{a}\\right)$ becomes $\\sin^2\\left(\\frac{2\\pi y}{a}\\right)$.\n\nThe probability density in terms of `y` is:\n$P(y) = \\frac{2}{a} \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{2\\pi y}{a}\\right)$\n\nFor small values of `y` (which is true within our small interval), we can use the small-angle approximation $\\sin(u) \\approx u$, where $u = \\frac{2\\pi y}{a}$.\n$P(y) \\approx \\frac{2}{a} \\left(\\frac{2\\pi y}{a}\\right)^2 = \\frac{2}{a} \\left(\\frac{4\\pi^2 y^2}{a^2}\\right) = \\frac{8\\pi^2}{a^3} y^2$\n\n**Step 5: Integrate the Approximated Function**\n\nNow we integrate this simplified function over the new limits for `y`:\nProbability $\\approx \\int_{-0.005a}^{0.005a} \\frac{8\\pi^2}{a^3} y^2 \\,dy$\nProbability $\\approx \\frac{8\\pi^2}{a^3} \\int_{-0.005a}^{0.005a} y^2 \\,dy$\n\nThe integral of $y^2$ is $\\frac{y^3}{3}$:\nProbability $\\approx \\frac{8\\pi^2}{a^3} \\left[ \\frac{y^3}{3} \\right]_{-0.005a}^{0.005a}$\nProbability $\\approx \\frac{8\\pi^2}{3a^3} \\left[ (0.005a)^3 - (-0.005a)^3 \\right]$\nProbability $\\approx \\frac{8\\pi^2}{3a^3} \\left[ (0.005a)^3 + (0.005a)^3 \\right]$\nProbability $\\approx \\frac{8\\pi^2}{3a^3} \\left[ 2 \\times (0.005a)^3 \\right]$\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the Final Numerical Value**\n\nSimplify the expression:\nProbability $\\approx \\frac{16\\pi^2}{3a^3} \\times (0.005)^3 a^3$\nThe $a^3$ terms cancel out:\nProbability $\\approx \\frac{16\\pi^2}{3} \\times (0.005)^3$\nProbability $\\approx \\frac{16\\pi^2}{3} \\times (1.25 \\times 10^{-7})$\n\nUsing the value $\\pi^2 \\approx 9.8696$:\nProbability $\\approx \\frac{16 \\times 9.8696}{3} \\times 1.25 \\times 10^{-7}$\nProbability $\\approx \\frac{157.9136}{3} \\times 1.25 \\times 10^{-7}$\nProbability $\\approx 52.6378 \\times 1.25 \\times 10^{-7}$\nProbability $\\approx 65.797 \\times 10^{-7}$\nProbability $\\approx 6.58 \\times 10^{-6}$\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Correct Quantum State:** Ensure you use `n=2`, not the ground state `n=1`. The location of nodes and antinodes is different.\n2.  **Node at the Center:** Recognize that for `n=2`, there is a node at $x=a/2$. This makes a simple approximation $P(x_{center}) \\times \\Delta x$ invalid and requires integration or a more sophisticated approximation (like the Taylor series).\n3.  **Small Interval Approximation:** The approximation is valid only because the interval $\\Delta x = 0.01a$ is very small compared to the box length `a`.\n4.  **Small-Angle Approximation:** The use of $\\sin(u) \\approx u$ is justified because the argument $u = \\frac{2\\pi y}{a}$ is small over the integration interval (its maximum value is $2\\pi(0.005) = 0.01\\pi \\approx 0.0314$ radians).\n5.  **Algebraic and Arithmetic Accuracy:** Careful handling of constants ($\\pi$, 2, etc.) and exponents during calculation is crucial.\n\nThe final result is a very small, but non-zero, probability.\n\n<<<6.58e-6>>>"
