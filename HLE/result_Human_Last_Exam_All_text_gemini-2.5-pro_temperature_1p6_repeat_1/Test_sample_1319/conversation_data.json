    "This is a fascinating question that requires cross-referencing an ancient text with modern geography. Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe goal is to identify the second tallest *historical* mountain that is explicitly *mentioned* in Homer's *Iliad*.\n*   \"After Mount Olympus\": We must exclude Mount Olympus, which is the tallest.\n*   \"historical mountain\": The mountain must be a real, identifiable geographical feature.\n*   \"mentioned in the Iliad\": The mountain's name must appear in the text of the *Iliad*.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Mountains Mentioned in the Iliad and Their Real-World Locations**\nFirst, we must list all the mountains named in the epic.\n\n1.  **Mount Olympus**: The home of the gods. This is our baseline and the tallest mountain in Greece. (Modern location: Mount Olympus, Greece. Elevation: 2,918 m / 9,573 ft).\n2.  **Mount Ida**: Mentioned frequently as the place from which Zeus watches the battle. (Modern location: Kaz Dağı, Turkey. Elevation: 1,774 m / 5,820 ft).\n3.  **Mount Samothrace** (also called Saos): Poseidon sits on its peak to watch the fighting. (Modern location: Mount Fengari on the island of Samothrace, Greece. Elevation: 1,611 m / 5,285 ft).\n4.  **Mount Athos**: Hera flies over this mountain during her journey from Olympus to Lemnos. (Modern location: Mount Athos, Greece. Elevation: 2,033 m / 6,670 ft).\n5.  **Mount Pelion**: Mentioned as the source of the ash wood used for Achilles' great spear. (Modern location: Mount Pelion, Greece. Elevation: 1,624 m / 5,328 ft).\n6.  **Mount Tmolus**: Mentioned in the \"Catalogue of Ships\" (Book 2) as the location of the Maeonians. (Modern location: Bozdağlar mountain range, with the peak Bozdağ, in Turkey. Elevation: 2,159 m / 7,083 ft).\n\n**Step 3: List and Address Potential Points of Confusion (Careful Points)**\n\n*   **The \"Two Mount Idas\" problem**: Greek mythology features two famous mountains named Ida: one near Troy (Kaz Dağı) and a much taller one on Crete (Mount Ida or Psiloritis, 2,456 m), where Zeus was said to have been raised. However, every mention of \"Mount Ida\" in the *Iliad* occurs within the context of the Trojan War. The narrative action and geography consistently point to the mountain overlooking the Trojan plain. There is no explicit mention of the Cretan Mount Ida in the *Iliad*. Therefore, for this analysis, we must use the Trojan Mount Ida, as it is the only one verifiably mentioned in the text.\n*   **Minor vs. Major Mentions**: The question does not distinguish between mountains central to the plot (like Ida) and those mentioned only in passing (like Tmolus or Athos). Any mountain explicitly named is a valid candidate.\n\n**Step 4: Rank the Identified Mountains by Elevation**\nNow, we compare the modern elevations of the mountains identified in Step 2, excluding Mount Olympus.\n\n1.  **Mount Tmolus** (Bozdağ): **2,159 m** (7,083 ft)\n2.  **Mount Athos**: **2,033 m** (6,670 ft)\n3.  **Mount Ida** (Kaz Dağı): **1,774 m** (5,820 ft)\n4.  **Mount Pelion**: **1,624 m** (5,328 ft)\n5.  **Mount Samothrace** (Fengari): **1,611 m** (5,285 ft)\n\n**Step 5: Determine the Final Answer**\nBy ranking the mountains mentioned in the *Iliad* according to their real-world height, the tallest after Mount Olympus is Mount Tmolus.\n\n<<<Mount Tmolus>>>"
