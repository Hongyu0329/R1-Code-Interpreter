    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the condition \"have the correct symmetry for optical activity\"\n\nOptical activity is the phenomenon where a material rotates the plane of polarization of linearly polarized light. The fundamental symmetry requirement for a crystal to exhibit natural optical activity is that it must be **chiral**.\n\nA chiral structure is one that is not superimposable on its mirror image. In the language of crystallography and point group symmetry, a crystal class is chiral if and only if its point group **lacks any improper rotation axes (Sₙ)**.\n\nThe most common improper rotation axes are:\n1.  A **center of inversion (i)**, which is equivalent to S₂.\n2.  A **mirror plane (m)**, which is equivalent to S₁.\n\nTherefore, for a crystal class to be optically active, its point group must not contain a center of inversion or a mirror plane. There are exactly 11 such chiral (or enantiomorphic) crystal classes:\n`1, 2, 222, 3, 32, 4, 422, 6, 622, 23, 432`\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the condition \"achiral\"\n\nAn achiral crystal class is, by definition, the opposite of a chiral one. An achiral structure *is* superimposable on its mirror image. This means its point group **must contain at least one improper rotation axis** (i.e., a center of inversion or a mirror plane).\n\nThe 21 achiral crystal classes are all the crystal classes that are not in the list of 11 chiral classes from Step 1.\nExamples include `m`, `2/m`, `mmm`, `4/m`, `bar(4)`, etc.\n\n### Step 3: Compare the conditions from Step 1 and Step 2\n\nThe question asks for crystal classes that are simultaneously:\n1.  **Achiral**\n2.  Have the symmetry for **optical activity** (which means they must be **chiral**)\n\nThese two conditions are mutually exclusive. A crystal class cannot be both chiral and achiral at the same time.\n\n*   Condition for Optical Activity: **No** mirror plane, **No** center of inversion.\n*   Condition for being Achiral: **Has** a mirror plane OR **Has** a center of inversion.\n\nIt is logically impossible to satisfy both conditions. Therefore, no crystal class can be both achiral and optically active.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the condition \"non-polar\"\n\nA non-polar crystal class is one that does not allow for a spontaneous electric dipole moment. This includes all 11 centrosymmetric crystal classes (those with a center of inversion) and 11 specific non-centrosymmetric classes that have other symmetries preventing polarity.\n\nWhile this condition further constrains the possibilities, it cannot resolve the fundamental contradiction identified in Step 3. We are searching for members of a set that is already empty.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe premise of the question is contradictory. Optical activity is a property exclusive to chiral crystals, but the question asks for achiral crystals. There is no intersection between the set of \"achiral crystal classes\" and the set of \"crystal classes with symmetry for optical activity\". Therefore, there are no crystal classes that satisfy all the given criteria.\n\n<<<There are no such crystal classes. The requirement for optical activity is that a crystal class must be chiral, which is fundamentally contradicted by the condition that it must also be achiral.>>>"
