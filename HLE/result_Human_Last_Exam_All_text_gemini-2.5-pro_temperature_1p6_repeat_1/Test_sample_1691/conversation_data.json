    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the analytical formula for the integral $I(\\epsilon)$ in the small $\\epsilon$ regime.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Integral and Identify the Dominant Contribution**\n\nThe integral is given by:\n$I(\\epsilon) = \\int_0^{15.00} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9.0 x^{5.0} + 5.0 x^{6.0} + 9.0 x^{8.0}} dx$\n\nWe are interested in the behavior of this integral for very small positive values of $\\epsilon$ ($\\epsilon \\to 0^+$).\nLet the denominator be $D(x, \\epsilon) = \\epsilon + g(x)$, where $g(x) = 9x^5 + 5x^6 + 9x^8$.\nThe integrand $\\frac{1}{D(x, \\epsilon)}$ becomes very large when the denominator $D(x, \\epsilon)$ is very small. For a small $\\epsilon$, this happens in the regions of the integration interval where $g(x)$ is at its minimum.\n\n**Step 2: Find the Minimum of g(x)**\n\nWe need to find the minimum value of $g(x) = 9x^5 + 5x^6 + 9x^8$ on the interval $[0, 15]$.\nFirst, let's find the derivative of $g(x)$ to locate critical points:\n$g'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(9x^5 + 5x^6 + 9x^8) = 45x^4 + 30x^5 + 72x^7$\nWe can factor out $x^4$:\n$g'(x) = x^4 (45 + 30x + 72x^3)$\nFor any $x > 0$, all terms in the parentheses are positive, so $(45 + 30x + 72x^3) > 0$. Also, $x^4 > 0$. Thus, $g'(x) > 0$ for all $x > 0$.\nThis means that $g(x)$ is a strictly increasing function on the interval $[0, 15]$.\nTherefore, the minimum value of $g(x)$ occurs at the left endpoint of the interval, $x=0$.\nThe minimum value is $g(0) = 9(0)^5 + 5(0)^6 + 9(0)^8 = 0$.\n\n**Careful Point 1:** The dominant contribution to the integral for small $\\epsilon$ comes from the neighborhood of the point where $g(x)$ is minimum, which is $x=0$.\n\n**Step 3: Approximate the Integrand Near the Dominant Point**\n\nSince the main contribution to the integral comes from the region near $x=0$, we can approximate the function $g(x)$ by its behavior for small $x$. For $x \\to 0$, the term with the lowest power of $x$ dominates:\n$g(x) = 9x^5 + 5x^6 + 9x^8 \\approx 9x^5$\nSo, the integral can be approximated by:\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\int_0^{15} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9x^5} dx$\n\n**Step 4: Simplify the Integral by Modifying the Integration Limit**\n\nThe integrand $\\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9x^5}$ decreases rapidly as $x$ increases. For large $x$, its value is very small. The main contribution to the value of this approximate integral comes from small $x$. The error introduced by extending the upper limit of integration from 15 to $\\infty$ is negligible compared to the leading-order term (it contributes a term that does not depend on $\\epsilon$ in a singular way, while the main part diverges as $\\epsilon \\to 0^+$).\nThus, we can simplify the problem to evaluating:\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9x^5} dx$\n\n**Careful Point 2:** Extending the integration limit to infinity is a standard technique in asymptotic analysis (Laplace's Method) for this type of integral, as it simplifies the calculation without affecting the leading-order behavior.\n\n**Step 5: Evaluate the Approximate Integral using a Scaling Substitution**\n\nLet's solve the integral $J = \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9x^5} dx$. We use a substitution that factors $\\epsilon$ out of the denominator. Let:\n$u^5 = \\frac{9x^5}{\\epsilon} \\implies u = \\left(\\frac{9}{\\epsilon}\\right)^{1/5} x \\implies x = \\left(\\frac{\\epsilon}{9}\\right)^{1/5} u$\nNow, find the differential $dx$:\n$dx = \\left(\\frac{\\epsilon}{9}\\right)^{1/5} du$\nThe integration limits for $u$ are still from $0$ to $\\infty$. Substituting these into the integral $J$:\n$J = \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9 \\left( \\left(\\frac{\\epsilon}{9}\\right)^{1/5} u \\right)^5} \\left(\\frac{\\epsilon}{9}\\right)^{1/5} du$\n$J = \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{\\left(\\frac{\\epsilon}{9}\\right)^{1/5}}{\\epsilon + 9 \\left(\\frac{\\epsilon}{9}\\right) u^5} du = \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{\\left(\\frac{\\epsilon}{9}\\right)^{1/5}}{\\epsilon + \\epsilon u^5} du$\n$J = \\frac{(\\epsilon/9)^{1/5}}{\\epsilon} \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{1+u^5} du = \\frac{\\epsilon^{1/5}}{9^{1/5}\\epsilon} \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{1+u^5} du$\n$J = \\frac{1}{9^{1/5}} \\epsilon^{1/5 - 1} \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{1+u^5} du = \\frac{1}{9^{1/5}} \\epsilon^{-4/5} \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{1+u^5} du$\n\n**Step 6: Use the Standard Definite Integral Formula**\n\nThe resulting integral is a well-known one. The general formula is:\n$\\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{1+u^n} du = \\frac{\\pi/n}{\\sin(\\pi/n)}$\nFor our case, $n=5$. So, we have:\n$\\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{1+u^5} du = \\frac{\\pi/5}{\\sin(\\pi/5)}$\n\n**Careful Point 3:** Remembering or looking up this standard integral formula is crucial. It can be derived using complex analysis (contour integration) or the Gamma function.\n\n**Step 7: Assemble the Final Analytical Formula**\n\nSubstitute the value of the definite integral back into the expression for $J$:\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx J = \\frac{1}{9^{1/5}} \\epsilon^{-4/5} \\left( \\frac{\\pi/5}{\\sin(\\pi/5)} \\right)$\nThis can be written more cleanly as:\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\frac{\\pi}{5 \\cdot 9^{1/5} \\sin(\\pi/5)} \\epsilon^{-4/5}$\n\nThis is the desired analytical formula that approximates $I(\\epsilon)$ for small $\\epsilon$.\n\n<<<I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\frac{\\pi}{5 \\cdot 9^{1/5} \\sin(\\pi/5)} \\epsilon^{-4/5}>>>"
