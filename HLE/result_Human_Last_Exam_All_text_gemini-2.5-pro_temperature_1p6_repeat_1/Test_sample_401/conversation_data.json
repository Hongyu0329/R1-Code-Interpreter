    "Answering this question requires a careful understanding of several concepts from point-set topology, specifically continuum theory. Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Defining the Key Terms\n\n*   **Continuum:** A continuum is a compact, connected Hausdorff space. The question specifies \"not necessarily metric,\" so we must use this general definition, not one restricted to metric spaces.\n*   **Subcontinuum:** A subcontinuum of a continuum $X$ is a subset of $X$ that is also a continuum (i.e., it is closed and connected). A *proper* subcontinuum is one that is not equal to the entire space $X$.\n*   **Indecomposable Continuum:** A continuum $X$ is called indecomposable if it cannot be expressed as the union of two proper subcontinua. That is, if $X = A \\cup B$ where $A$ and $B$ are subcontinua, then either $A=X$ or $B=X$.\n*   **Composant:** For a point $p$ in a continuum $X$, the composant of $p$, denoted $C(p)$, is the set of all points $x \\in X$ for which there exists a proper subcontinuum of $X$ containing both $p$ and $x$. The relation \"$x$ is in the same composant as $p$\" is an equivalence relation for indecomposable continua, meaning the collection of all distinct composants forms a partition of the space $X$.\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing the Minimum Number of Composants\n\nWe are looking for the smallest possible value for the number of composants in an indecomposable continuum. Let's test the smallest possible natural numbers.\n\n#### Can the number of composants be 1?\n\nLet's assume a continuum $X$ has only one composant.\n1.  By definition of having one composant, for any two points $p, q \\in X$, there is a proper subcontinuum containing both.\n2.  Let's fix a point $p \\in X$. Since every other point $x \\in X$ is in the composant of $p$, it means that for every $x \\in X$, there is a proper subcontinuum $K_x$ such that $\\{p, x\\} \\subseteq K_x$.\n3.  The collection of all such proper subcontinua, $\\{K_x \\mid x \\in X\\}$, forms a cover of $X$.\n4.  Since $X$ is compact, there must be a finite subcover. That is, there exist a finite number of points $x_1, \\dots, x_n$ such that $X = K_{x_1} \\cup K_{x_2} \\cup \\dots \\cup K_{x_n}$.\n5.  Let's denote these subcontinua as $K_1, \\dots, K_n$. They are all proper subcontinua.\n6.  We can now form two new subcontinua. Let $A = K_1$ and $B = K_2 \\cup \\dots \\cup K_n$. (If $n=1$, $X=K_1$, which contradicts $K_1$ being proper. So $n \\ge 2$). The union of a finite number of intersecting subcontinua is a subcontinuum, and since all $K_i$ contain $p$, their union $B$ is a subcontinuum.\n7.  Now, $X = A \\cup B$. By definition, $A=K_1$ is a proper subcontinuum. Is $B$ a proper subcontinuum? If it is, then $X$ is decomposable, and we are done.\n8.  If $B=X$, we can try a different split. Let $A' = K_1 \\cup K_2$ and $B' = K_3 \\cup \\dots \\cup K_n$. We can continue this process. Let $m$ be the smallest integer such that $\\bigcup_{i=1}^m K_i = X$. We know $m > 1$. Let $A = \\bigcup_{i=1}^{m-1} K_i$ and $B = K_m$. By the minimality of $m$, $A$ must be a proper subcontinuum. $B=K_m$ is also a proper subcontinuum by definition.\n9.  Since $X=A \\cup B$, we have successfully written $X$ as the union of two proper subcontinua. This means $X$ is decomposable.\n\nThis proves that any continuum with only one composant must be decomposable. Therefore, an indecomposable continuum must have more than one composant. The smallest possible number is at least 2.\n\n#### Can the number of composants be 2?\n\nThis is the most critical part of the analysis and where the \"not necessarily metric\" condition is crucial.\n\n*   **In Metric Continua:** There is a well-known theorem by Stefan Mazurkiewicz (1920) which states that any indecomposable *metric* continuum has uncountably many composants (specifically, $2^{\\aleph_0}$ of them). The proof of this theorem relies on the Baire Category Theorem applied to the metric space, showing that if the number of composants were countable, the space would be a countable union of \"small\" (first category) sets, which contradicts the completeness of the metric space.\n\n*   **In Non-Metric Continua:** The Baire Category argument used for metric spaces does not carry over straightforwardly. While compact Hausdorff spaces are Baire spaces, the part of the argument that shows each composant is a \"small\" set (first category) relies on the space having a countable base for its topology, a property of separable metric spaces but not of all compact Hausdorff spaces.\n\nThe question of whether a non-metric indecomposable continuum could have a countable number of composants remained open for a long time. In 1960, J. Mioduszewski provided the answer in his paper \"On the number of composants of an indecomposable continuum\". He constructed a non-metric, indecomposable continuum that has **exactly two** composants.\n\nThis construction serves as an existence proof, confirming that it is possible for an indecomposable continuum to have just two composants.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n1.  An indecomposable continuum cannot have 1 composant.\n2.  An indecomposable continuum can have 2 composants (as demonstrated by Mioduszewski's example).\n\nTherefore, the smallest number of composants an indecomposable continuum can have is 2.\n\n<<<2>>>"
