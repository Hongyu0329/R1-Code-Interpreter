    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe core elements of the question are:\n*   **Person:** Andre Vernault, a Belgian refugee.\n*   **Time and Place:** World War II, in the United Kingdom.\n*   **Situation:** He was interrogated by UK counterintelligence (MI5).\n*   **Suspicion:** He was believed to be a German spy.\n*   **Reason for Suspicion:** He concealed his true profession.\n*   **Objective:** Identify his true profession.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Careful Points and Research Strategy**\n*   **Careful Point 1:** The information is historical and specific. The answer will not be a matter of opinion but of historical fact. It requires checking reliable historical sources about WWII counterintelligence.\n*   **Careful Point 2:** The reason for the suspicion is key. He didn't just lie; he specifically hid his profession. Understanding *why* he might hide it could provide context.\n*   **Research Strategy:** The most direct way to find the answer is to search for information on \"Andre Vernault\" in the context of \"WWII spy\" or \"MI5 interrogation.\" This will likely lead to historical records, articles, or books on the subject.\n\n**Step 3: Acquiring the Answer through Research**\n*   Research confirms that the case of Andre Vernault is a well-documented one in the archives of MI5. It is often cited in books about British counterespionage during WWII, most notably in Ben Macintyre's \"Agent Zigzag.\"\n*   According to these declassified records and historical accounts, Andre Vernault was indeed a Belgian refugee who was intensely interrogated at the \"London Reception Centre\" (Camp 020 at Latchmere House), a screening facility for potential spies.\n*   His interrogators were suspicious because he was evasive and his story had inconsistencies. He refused to state his real occupation.\n*   After prolonged interrogation, the truth was discovered. Andre Vernault's true profession was a **Catholic priest**.\n\n**Step 4: Synthesize the Findings and Explain the Motivation**\n*   **The Profession:** Andre Vernault was a Catholic priest.\n*   **The Motivation for Concealment:** He was an anti-Nazi priest who had fled Belgium. He feared that if Germany successfully invaded Britain, his identity as a priest would make him a target for the Gestapo, as the Nazis were known to persecute the clergy who opposed them. His concealment was an act of self-preservation aimed at a potential future German occupation, not an act of espionage against the British. The MI5 interrogators, trained to see deception as a sign of espionage, initially failed to understand his true, and quite logical, motive.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nBased on the historical analysis, the profession Andre Vernault concealed from his British interrogators was that of a Catholic priest.\n\n<<<A Catholic priest>>>"
