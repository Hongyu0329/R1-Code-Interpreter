    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the French equivalent of the Gaulish name \"Odobeccus\".\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Identify the origin and context of the name \"Odobeccus\".**\nThe name \"Odobeccus\" belongs to a historical figure from the early 5th century. He was a nobleman of Frankish or Alamannic descent who was active in Gaul. Therefore, the name is not Gaulish (Celtic) in origin, but rather Germanic. It was recorded in Latin, which was the language of administration and writing at the time. The \"-us\" ending is a standard Latin nominative masculine singular ending added to the Germanic name.\n\n**Step 2: Deconstruct the name into its original Germanic elements.**\nBy removing the Latin suffix \"-us\", we get the name **Odobecc**. Like many Germanic names of that era, it is a dithematic name, meaning it is composed of two distinct elements.\n*   **Odo-**: This is the first element. It derives from the Proto-Germanic root **\\*audaz**, which means \"wealth\", \"riches\", or \"property\". This is a very common element in Germanic names (e.g., Odoacer, Otto).\n*   **-becc**: This is the second element. Its exact meaning in this context is less certain, but it completes the compound name.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the process of name evolution from Germanic to French.**\nThe evolution of names from the Germanic-speaking Franks into French followed several common patterns. One of the most important patterns for long, two-part names is **hypocorism**, which is the practice of shortening a name. In most cases, the name was shortened to its first element.\n*   The full name `Odobecc` would have been commonly shortened in everyday speech to just **Odo**.\n\n**Step 4: Trace the phonetic evolution of the shortened name into Modern French.**\nWe now need to trace how the name `Odo` evolved as the French language developed from the Vulgar Latin and Frankish spoken in Gaul.\n*   The name `Odo` was popular and was borne by historical figures like Odo of Paris, who became King of West Francia in the 9th century.\n*   In the transition from Latin and Old French to Modern French, the initial `O-` sound in this name underwent a process called diphthongization, changing into `Eu-`.\n*   Thus, the name **Odo** became the Modern French **Eudes**.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude the equivalent.**\nBased on the process of Latinization, hypocoristic shortening, and phonetic evolution, the shortened form `Odo` is the practical base name for `Odobeccus`. The modern French name that directly evolved from `Odo` is `Eudes`.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Origin**: It is crucial to correctly identify the name as Germanic, not Gaulish (Celtic), despite the person living in Gaul. This determines the etymological roots to follow.\n2.  **Latinization**: The \"-us\" ending is purely grammatical from Latin and must be removed to find the original name's stem.\n3.  **Hypocorism (Shortening)**: Recognizing that long compound names were often shortened is key. Without this step, trying to evolve the full \"Odobecc\" would be misleading and would not lead to the common historical equivalent.\n4.  **Phonetic Evolution**: Understanding the specific sound changes from Latin/Germanic to French (like O > Eu) is necessary to connect the ancient name to its modern form.\n5.  **Distinction**: While `Odon` is another French form derived from the same root, `Eudes` is the more common and vernacular evolution that emerged through natural linguistic changes over centuries.\n\nBy following this analysis, we arrive at the final answer.\n\n<<<Eudes>>>"
