    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the question and the algebraic structure\nThe question asks for the percentage of irreducible objects in the category $C$ of indecomposable finite-dimensional representations of $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$ for $q$ a primitive third root of unity. Let $\\ell=3$. The algebra in question is the small quantum group $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$, which is a finite-dimensional Hopf algebra of dimension $\\ell^3=27$. This algebra is not semisimple, meaning there exist indecomposable representations that are not irreducible.\n\n### Step 2: Characterize the indecomposable modules\nThe representation theory of $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ at a root of unity is known to be of \"tame\" representation type. This means that besides a finite set of \"discrete\" indecomposable modules, there are continuous one-parameter families of indecomposable modules. The total number of non-isomorphic indecomposable modules is infinite.\n\n### Step 3: Characterize the irreducible modules\nThe irreducible (or simple) modules for $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ are well-known. There are exactly $\\ell$ non-isomorphic simple modules, denoted $L(n)$ for $n=1, \\dots, \\ell$. For our case, $\\ell=3$, there are three simple modules:\n1.  $L(1)$: a 1-dimensional module (the trivial representation).\n2.  $L(2)$: a 2-dimensional module.\n3.  $L(3)$: a 3-dimensional module (the Steinberg module).\n\n### Step 4: Interpret the term \"percentage\"\nSince there are infinitely many non-isomorphic indecomposable modules but only 3 non-isomorphic irreducible modules, a literal interpretation of \"percentage\" would yield $\\frac{3}{\\infty} = 0$. This kind of trivial answer is usually not what is intended in such a problem. This suggests that the question is not asking about the entire infinite set of indecomposable modules, but rather about a specific, finite, and representative class of them.\n\nThe most canonical and fundamental finite class of indecomposable modules for any finite-dimensional algebra is the set of **indecomposable projective modules**. Every module is a quotient of a direct sum of these modules, and they form a basis for the Grothendieck group of projectives. We will proceed under the well-justified assumption that \"the objects of $C$\" is a slightly imprecise reference to this class of modules.\n\n### Step 5: List the indecomposable projective modules\nFor any finite-dimensional algebra, there is a one-to-one correspondence between isomorphism classes of simple modules and isomorphism classes of indecomposable projective modules. Each simple module $L(n)$ has a unique projective cover, $P(n)$, which is an indecomposable projective module.\nSince there are 3 simple modules ($L(1), L(2), L(3)$), there are 3 indecomposable projective modules: $P(1), P(2), P(3)$.\nOur set of objects to analyze is thus $\\{P(1), P(2), P(3)\\}$.\n\n### Step 6: Identify which indecomposable projectives are irreducible\nAn indecomposable projective module $P(n)$ is irreducible if and only if it is isomorphic to a simple module. This occurs if and only if the simple module $L(n)$ is itself projective.\nSo the question reduces to determining which of the simple modules $L(1), L(2), L(3)$ are projective.\n\nThe algebra $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ is a self-injective algebra. For such algebras, a simple module is projective if and only if it resides in a block by itself (i.e., it doesn't \"link\" to any other simple module via non-trivial extensions).\n\nThe block structure of $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ for $\\ell=3$ is as follows:\n1.  The Steinberg module $L(3)$ is always in a block of its own. Therefore, $L(3)$ is a projective module. This means its projective cover $P(3)$ is just $L(3)$ itself. So, $P(3)$ is irreducible.\n2.  The simple modules $L(1)$ and $L(2)$ are known to be linked, meaning $\\text{Ext}^1(L(1), L(2)) \\neq 0$ and $\\text{Ext}^1(L(2), L(1)) \\neq 0$. Consequently, they belong to the same block, the so-called principal block. Since this block contains more than one simple module, neither $L(1)$ nor $L(2)$ can be projective.\n3.  Therefore, their projective covers, $P(1)$ and $P(2)$, are not simple (irreducible). For instance, $P(1)$ has a more complex structure, with composition factors being $L(1), L(2), L(1)$.\n\n### Step 7: Calculate the final percentage\nSummarizing the analysis from the previous step:\n*   The set of indecomposable projective modules is $\\{P(1), P(2), P(3)\\}$. There are 3 such objects.\n*   The irreducible modules within this set are those where the corresponding simple is projective. Only $L(3)$ is projective.\n*   So, only $P(3) \\cong L(3)$ is irreducible.\n*   We have 1 irreducible module out of a total of 3 modules in our representative set.\n\nThe percentage is $\\frac{1}{3} \\times 100\\% = 33.33...\\%$."
