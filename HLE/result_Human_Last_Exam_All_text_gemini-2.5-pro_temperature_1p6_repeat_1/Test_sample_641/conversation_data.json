    "An involution in a group $G$ is an element $g$ such that $g^2 = e$ (the identity element) and $g \\neq e$. We want to find the number of involutions in the projective special unitary group $G = \\text{PSU}(4, 997)$.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the group PSU(4, 997)**\nThe group PSU(n, q) is defined as PSU(n, q) = SU(n, q) / Z(SU(n, q)).\nHere, $n=4$ and $q=997$. The group acts on a 4-dimensional vector space over the field $\\mathbb{F}_{997^2}$.\n*   SU(4, 997) is the Special Unitary Group, consisting of $4 \\times 4$ matrices $A$ with entries in $\\mathbb{F}_{997^2}$ such that $A^*A = I$ (unitary condition, where $A^*$ is the conjugate transpose) and $\\det(A)=1$. The conjugation is the field automorphism $x \\mapsto x^q$.\n*   Z(SU(n, q)) is the center of SU(n, q). It consists of scalar matrices $\\lambda I$ such that $\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$, $\\lambda^n=1$, and $\\lambda^{q+1}=1$. The order of the center is $d = \\gcd(n, q+1)$.\n*   For PSU(4, 997), $n=4$ and $q=997$. The order of the center is $d = \\gcd(4, 997+1) = \\gcd(4, 998)$. Since $998 = 2 \\times 499$, the greatest common divisor is 2.\n*   Thus, the center of SU(4, 997) is $Z = \\{I, -I\\}$.\n\n**Step 2: Relate involutions in PSU to elements in SU**\nLet $\\pi: \\text{SU}(4, 997) \\to \\text{PSU}(4, 997)$ be the quotient map. An element $g \\in \\text{PSU}(4, 997)$ is an involution if $g \\neq 1$ and $g^2 = 1$.\nLet $g = \\pi(A)$ for some $A \\in \\text{SU}(4, 997)$.\n*   $g^2 = \\pi(A)^2 = \\pi(A^2) = 1$ implies $A^2 \\in \\ker(\\pi) = Z = \\{I, -I\\}$.\n*   $g \\neq 1$ implies $A \\notin Z = \\{I, -I\\}$.\n\nSo, we need to count the number of elements $A \\in \\text{SU}(4, 997)$ such that $A^2 \\in \\{I, -I\\}$ but $A \\notin \\{I, -I\\}$. Let this set of preimages be $\\mathcal{P}'$. The number of involutions in PSU(4, 997) is then $|\\mathcal{P}'| / |Z| = |\\mathcal{P}'|/2$.\n\nThe set $\\mathcal{P}'$ can be partitioned into two disjoint sets:\n1.  $\\{A \\in \\text{SU}(4, 997) \\mid A^2=I, A \\notin \\{I, -I\\}\\}$.\n2.  $\\{A \\in \\text{SU}(4, 997) \\mid A^2=-I\\}$. (If $A^2=-I$, then $A$ cannot be $I$ or $-I$, as this would imply $I=-I$, which is false for characteristic 997).\n\n**Step 3: Count the elements of the first type**\nThese are involutions in SU(4, 997) other than $-I$. An involution in a unitary group is semisimple, with eigenvalues $\\pm 1$. The matrix $A$ corresponds to a decomposition of the vector space $V = V_1 \\oplus V_{-1}$ into eigenspaces. Since $A$ is unitary, these subspaces are orthogonal and non-degenerate.\nLet $k=\\dim(V_{-1})$. The condition $\\det(A)=1$ implies $(-1)^k = 1$, so $k$ must be even. Possible values for $k$ are 0, 2, 4.\n*   $k=0$: $A=I$. This is in $Z$.\n*   $k=4$: $A=-I$. This is an involution, but it is in $Z$.\n*   $k=2$: This gives involutions $A$ that are not in $Z$. The number of such involutions equals the number of non-degenerate 2-dimensional subspaces in the 4-dimensional unitary space. This number is given by the formula $\\frac{|U(4,q)|}{|U(2,q)||U(2,q)|}$, where $|U(n,q)| = q^{n(n-1)/2}\\prod_{i=1}^n(q^i - (-1)^i)$.\n    *   The calculation yields $q^4(q^2-q+1)(q^2+1)$.\n    So, the number of elements of the first type is $q^4(q^2-q+1)(q^2+1)$.\n\n**Step 4: Count the elements of the second type**\nWe need to count the number of elements $A \\in \\text{SU}(4, 997)$ such that $A^2 = -I$.\nThe eigenvalues of such an $A$ must be roots of $x^2+1=0$, i.e., $i$ and $-i$.\nWe need to check if $i \\in \\mathbb{F}_q$ where $q=997$. This is true if $-1$ is a quadratic residue modulo 997. By the first supplement to the law of quadratic reciprocity, this is true if $997 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$.\n$997 = 4 \\times 249 + 1$, so $997 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$. Thus, $i, -i \\in \\mathbb{F}_{997}$.\nSuch an operator $A$ has two eigenvalues $i$ (with multiplicity 2) and $-i$ (with multiplicity 2). All such matrices have determinant $i^2(-i)^2=1$ and thus belong to SU(4, 997).\nThe number of such elements is given by the size of the corresponding conjugacy class in U(4, q), which is $\\frac{|U(4,q)|}{|C_{U(4,q)}(A)|}$. The centralizer $C_{U(4,q)}(A)$ is isomorphic to $GL(2, q^2)$.\n*   The number of such elements is calculated to be $\\frac{|U(4,q)|}{|GL(2,q^2)|} = q^4(q^3+1)$.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the final number**\nThe total number of preimages is the sum of the counts from steps 3 and 4:\n$|\\mathcal{P}'| = q^4(q^2-q+1)(q^2+1) + q^4(q^3+1)$.\nThe number of involutions in PSU(4, 997) is $|\\mathcal{P}'|/2$.\nNumber of involutions $= \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ q^4(q^2-q+1)(q^2+1) + q^4(q^3+1) \\right]$\n$= \\frac{1}{2} q^4 \\left[ (q^2-q+1)(q^2+1) + (q+1)(q^2-q+1) \\right]$\n$= \\frac{1}{2} q^4 (q^2-q+1) \\left[ (q^2+1) + (q+1) \\right]$\n$= \\frac{1}{2} q^4 (q^2-q+1)(q^2+q+2)$.\n\nNow, we substitute $q=997$:\nNumber $= \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 997^4 \\cdot (997^2 - 997 + 1) \\cdot (997^2 + 997 + 2)$.\n*   $997^2 = 994009$.\n*   $997^2 - 997 + 1 = 994009 - 997 + 1 = 993013$.\n*   $997^2 + 997 + 2 = 994009 + 997 + 2 = 995008$.\nNumber $= \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 997^4 \\cdot (993013) \\cdot (995008)$\n$= 997^4 \\cdot 993013 \\cdot 497504$.\n*   $997^4 = (994009)^2 = 988073844081$.\n*   $993013 \\times 497504 = 494056285252$.\nNumber $= 988073844081 \\times 494056285252 = 488151230188839063261552$.\n\n<<<488151230188839063261552>>>"
