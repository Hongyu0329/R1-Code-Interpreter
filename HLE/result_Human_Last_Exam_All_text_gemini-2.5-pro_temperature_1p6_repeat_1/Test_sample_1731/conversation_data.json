    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the equilibrium values of entropy and mean energy for the Bose case of light quanta (photons) using the principles of Large Deviation Theory.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Connecting Large Deviation Theory with Statistical Mechanics**\n\nThe fundamental principle of statistical mechanics is that a system in thermal equilibrium will be found in its most probable macroscopic state. Large Deviation Theory (LDT) provides a mathematical framework for this principle.\n\n*   **Sanov's Theorem:** This theorem concerns the probability of an empirical distribution deviating from a true underlying distribution. In statistical mechanics, we can consider the microstates of a system as being drawn from some underlying probability distribution. The macroscopic state (defined by properties like mean energy) corresponds to an empirical observation. Sanov's theorem states that the probability of observing a particular macrostate (empirical distribution) `{p_i}` is exponentially small, with the rate of decay given by the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. To find the most probable, or equilibrium, state, we must find the distribution `{p_i}` that minimizes this divergence. If we assume a uniform prior (all microstates are a priori equally likely), minimizing the KL divergence is equivalent to maximizing the entropy of the distribution, `S = -k_B Σ p_i ln(p_i)`. For a system of bosons, this corresponds to maximizing the Boltzmann entropy `S = k_B ln(W)`, where `W` is the number of ways to realize the macrostate.\n\n*   **Cramér-Chernoff Theorem:** This theorem provides a rate function for the large deviations of a sample mean. When we impose a constraint on the system, such as a fixed mean energy `⟨E⟩ = U`, we are constraining a sample mean. The mathematical technique used to handle this constraint, both in LDT and statistical mechanics, is the method of Lagrange multipliers. The Lagrange multiplier `β` is directly related to the \"tilting parameter\" used in the proof of the Cramér-Chernoff theorem.\n\n**Step 2: Defining the Entropy for a Bose Gas**\n\nFor bosons (indistinguishable particles that can occupy the same state), the number of ways (`W_i`) to place `n_i` particles into `g_i` degenerate quantum states at energy level `ε_i` is given by the Bose-Einstein counting formula:\n$W_i = \\frac{(n_i + g_i - 1)!}{n_i! (g_i - 1)!}$\n\nThe total number of microstates for a macrostate defined by the set of occupation numbers `{n_i}` is the product over all energy levels:\n$W = \\prod_i W_i$\n\nThe entropy of the system is given by the Boltzmann formula, `S = k_B ln(W)`. Using Stirling's approximation (`ln(x!) ≈ x ln(x) - x`) for large `n_i` and `g_i`, the entropy becomes:\n$S \\approx k_B \\sum_i \\left[ (n_i + g_i) \\ln(n_i + g_i) - n_i \\ln(n_i) - g_i \\ln(g_i) \\right]$\n\n**Step 3: Applying Constraints and Maximizing Entropy**\n\nWe need to find the distribution `{n_i}` that maximizes this entropy `S` subject to the physical constraints on the system.\n\n1.  **Energy Constraint:** The total energy of the system is fixed at a mean value `U`.\n    $\\sum_i n_i \\varepsilon_i = U$\n\n2.  **Particle Number Constraint:** For a typical gas, the total number of particles `N` is conserved (`Σ n_i = N`). **However, for light quanta (photons), the number of particles is not conserved.** Photons can be created and annihilated. This means there is no constraint on the total number of photons. In the language of thermodynamics, this corresponds to a chemical potential of zero (`μ=0`).\n\nWe use the method of Lagrange multipliers to maximize `S` subject to the energy constraint. We maximize the function `L = S - β(Σ n_i ε_i - U)`.\nSetting the derivative with respect to `n_i` to zero (`∂L/∂n_i = 0`):\n$\\frac{\\partial (S/k_B)}{\\partial n_i} - \\beta \\varepsilon_i = 0$\n$\\ln\\left(\\frac{n_i + g_i}{n_i}\\right) - \\beta \\varepsilon_i = 0$\n$\\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{g_i}{n_i}\\right) = \\beta \\varepsilon_i$\n\nSolving for the equilibrium occupation number `⟨n_i⟩`:\n$⟨n_i⟩ = \\frac{g_i}{e^{\\beta \\varepsilon_i} - 1}$\n\nFrom thermodynamics, the Lagrange multiplier `β` is identified with the inverse temperature, `β = 1/(k_B T)`. This gives the **Planck distribution** for the equilibrium occupation of photons.\n$⟨n_i⟩ = \\frac{g_i}{e^{\\varepsilon_i / (k_B T)} - 1}$\n\n**Step 4: Calculating the Equilibrium Mean Energy (U)**\n\nThe mean energy is `U = Σ_i ⟨n_i⟩ ε_i`. To evaluate this sum for a continuous spectrum of energies, we replace the sum with an integral and `g_i` with the density of states `g(ε)dε`. For photons in a 3D box of volume `V`, including two polarization states, the density of states is:\n$g(\\varepsilon) d\\varepsilon = \\frac{8\\pi V}{h^3 c^3} \\varepsilon^2 d\\varepsilon$\n\nThe integral for the mean energy becomes:\n$U = \\int_0^\\infty \\varepsilon \\frac{1}{e^{\\varepsilon / (k_B T)} - 1} g(\\varepsilon) d\\varepsilon = \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{8\\pi V}{h^3 c^3} \\frac{\\varepsilon^3}{e^{\\varepsilon / (k_B T)} - 1} d\\varepsilon$\n\nThis is a standard integral form. By letting `x = ε / (k_B T)`, we get:\n$U = \\frac{8\\pi V (k_B T)^4}{h^3 c^3} \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{x^3}{e^x - 1} dx$\n\nThe value of the definite integral is `π⁴/15`. Therefore, the equilibrium mean energy is:\n$U = \\frac{8\\pi^5 V (k_B T)^4}{15 h^3 c^3}$\nThis is the famous Stefan-Boltzmann Law for total energy.\n\n**Step 5: Calculating the Equilibrium Entropy (S)**\n\nWe can calculate the entropy using the thermodynamic relation `S = (U - F) / T`, where `F` is the Helmholtz free energy. For a system with `μ=0`, the Helmholtz free energy is `F = -PV`. For a photon gas (an ultra-relativistic gas), the pressure `P` is related to the energy density `u=U/V` by `P = u/3 = U/(3V)`.\n\nThus, `F = - (U/(3V)) * V = -U/3`.\n\nSubstituting this into the entropy equation:\n$S = \\frac{U - (-U/3)}{T} = \\frac{4U}{3T}$\n\nNow, we substitute the expression for `U` found in the previous step:\n$S = \\frac{4}{3T} \\left( \\frac{8\\pi^5 V (k_B T)^4}{15 h^3 c^3} \\right) = \\frac{32\\pi^5 V k_B^4 T^3}{45 h^3 c^3}$\n\n### Careful Points\n\n1.  **Indistinguishability and Statistics:** It is crucial to use Bose-Einstein statistics for photons, as they are indistinguishable bosons. This leads to the specific form of the entropy `S`.\n2.  **Non-conservation of Photon Number:** The most important specific property of a photon gas is that the particle number is not a conserved quantity. This sets the chemical potential `μ` to zero and removes one of the constraints during the entropy maximization, simplifying the final distribution.\n3.  **Density of States:** To move from a discrete sum to a continuous integral for macroscopic properties like `U` and `S`, the correct density of states `g(ε)` must be used. For photons in a 3D volume, this includes a factor of 2 for polarization.\n4.  **Role of LDT:** LDT provides the rigorous justification for the principle of maximum entropy. The equilibrium state is the one that is overwhelmingly most probable, and the Lagrange multiplier technique used to enforce constraints (like fixed mean energy) is central to the Cramér-Chernoff large deviation result.\n\n---\n### Final Answer\n\nThe equilibrium values for the mean energy (U) and entropy (S) for light quanta in a volume V at temperature T are given by:\n\n**Equilibrium Mean Energy (U):**\n$U = \\frac{8\\pi^5 k_B^4}{15 h^3 c^3} V T^4$\n\n**Equilibrium Entropy (S):**\n$S = \\frac{32\\pi^5 k_B^4}{45 h^3 c^3} V T^3$\n\n<<<\nEquilibrium Mean Energy (U): $U = \\frac{8\\pi^5 k_B^4}{15 h^3 c^3} V T^4$\nEquilibrium Entropy (S): $S = \\frac{32\\pi^5 k_B^4}{45 h^3 c^3} V T^3$\n>>>"
