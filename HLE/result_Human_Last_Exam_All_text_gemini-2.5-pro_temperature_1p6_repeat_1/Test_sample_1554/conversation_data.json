    "### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Core Subject:** A philosopher.\n    *   **Affiliation:** Belonging to the \"Lviv-Warsaw School.\" This is a specific and influential school of Polish logic and philosophy active in the 20th century. Key figures include Kazimierz Twardowski, Jan Łukasiewicz, Alfred Tarski, Stanisław Leśniewski, Tadeusz Kotarbiński, and Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz.\n    *   **Key Action:** Decomposing or analyzing a concept.\n    *   **The Concept:** The notion of a \"hallmark.\" In the context of philosophy of language and semiotics, \"hallmark\" is best understood as a \"sign\" or \"mark\" (*znak* in Polish).\n    *   **The Components of Decomposition:** \"Symptoms\" and \"signals.\" This is a very specific distinction.\n\n2.  **Identify the Philosophical Field:**\n    *   The distinction between different types of signs (like symptoms and signals) falls under the field of **semiotics**, the study of signs and symbols. This field is a sub-discipline of logic and the philosophy of language, areas where the Lviv-Warsaw School excelled.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Potential Candidates from the Lviv-Warsaw School:**\n    *   While many members of the school worked on logic and language, the philosopher most famous for his detailed work in semantics, pragmatics, and developing a theory of signs is **Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz**.\n    *   Other figures, like Tarski, focused more on formal semantics (truth theory), and Łukasiewicz on formal logic systems. Kotarbiński's reism is a metaphysical doctrine, though it has linguistic implications. Ajdukiewicz's work, especially in his book *Pragmatic Logic* (*Logika pragmatyczna*), directly addresses the nature of signs and meaning.\n\n4.  **Verify the Specific Distinction:**\n    *   We need to confirm if it was indeed Ajdukiewicz who distinguished between \"symptoms\" and \"signals.\"\n    *   In his semiotic theory, Ajdukiewicz analyzes the general concept of a \"sign\" (*znak*). He proposes a fundamental division of signs into two categories.\n    *   **Category 1: Symptoms (or Indications; *oznaki*):** These are **natural signs**. The relationship between the sign and what it signifies is based on a natural, often causal, link. This relationship exists independently of human intention or convention.\n        *   *Example:* Smoke is a symptom of fire. A fever is a symptom of an illness.\n    *   **Category 2: Signals (or Conventional Signs; *sygnały*):** These are **conventional signs**. The relationship between the sign and what it signifies is established by a rule, agreement, or convention created by humans.\n        *   *Example:* The word \"dog\" is a signal for a canine animal in English. A red traffic light is a signal to stop.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The decomposition of the general notion of a sign (referred to as \"hallmark\" in the question) into natural signs (symptoms) and conventional signs (signals) is a well-known contribution of **Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz**. He is the Lviv-Warsaw School philosopher who made this specific analysis.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Terminology:** The term \"hallmark\" is a slightly informal rendering of the philosophical concept of a \"sign\" (*znak* in Polish), which is the subject of the analysis.\n*   **Translation:** The Polish terms are *oznaka* (symptom/indication) and *sygnał* (signal). Understanding these helps confirm the source of the distinction.\n*   **Attribution:** While semiotics has a long history, this specific classificatory scheme within the context of 20th-century analytical philosophy is strongly associated with Ajdukiewicz and the Lviv-Warsaw School.\n\nWith the analysis complete, the answer is definitively identified.\n\n<<<Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz>>>"
