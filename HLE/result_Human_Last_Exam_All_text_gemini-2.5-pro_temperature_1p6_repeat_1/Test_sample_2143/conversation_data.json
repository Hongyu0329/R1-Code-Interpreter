    "This is an analysis of a riddle that requires identifying a historical figure based on a specific literary or theological interpretation of his work.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Subject Matter:** The clues point to the Ten Commandments (the Decalogue) from the Bible.\n    *   \"The issue of another's material possessions\" directly refers to the Tenth Commandment: \"You shall not covet your neighbor's house... or anything that belongs to your neighbor.\"\n    *   \"The prohibition against representation\" refers to the Second Commandment: \"You shall not make for yourself an image in the form of anything in heaven above or on the earth beneath or in the waters below.\"\n\n2.  **Analyze the Chronology:** The riddle states this happens \"at the end of HIS work\". The Tenth Commandment is the last of the Ten Commandments, which fits this description perfectly.\n\n3.  **Deconstruct the Interpretation:** The central part of the riddle is Veronika Campan's interpretation: \"HE did this by naturally ignoring the prohibition against representation.\"\n    *   This suggests a contradiction or paradox between the Second and Tenth Commandments.\n    *   To understand the command \"You shall not covet your neighbor's house... ox... donkey,\" one must first create a *mental image* or *representation* of a house, an ox, and a donkey.\n    *   This act of creating a mental image can be interpreted as a subtle violation or \"ignoring\" of the spirit of the Second Commandment, which forbids making any likeness or representation.\n\n4.  **Identify \"HE\":** The question asks for the full name of the person who delivered this work (the Ten Commandments). In the biblical narrative, particularly in the Book of Exodus, the prophet who received the Ten Commandments from God on Mount Sinai and delivered them to the people of Israel is **Moses**. He is the central human figure associated with the giving of the Law.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe work is the Ten Commandments. The end of the work is the Tenth Commandment. The described paradox is how the Tenth Commandment requires mental imagery, thus \"ignoring\" the Second Commandment's prohibition on representation. The figure who delivered this work to the people is Moses.\n\n<<<Moses>>>"
