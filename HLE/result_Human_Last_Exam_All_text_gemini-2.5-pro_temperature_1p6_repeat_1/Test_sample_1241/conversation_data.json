    "This problem asks for the steady-state probability sum $P_0(+\\infty) + P_1(+\\infty)$ for a system described by the Kolmogorov-Chapman equations.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understand the System:** The given equations describe a continuous-time Markov chain with four states {0, 1, 2, 3}. The variables $P_i(t)$ represent the probability of the system being in state $i$ at time $t$. The constants $\\lambda_{ij}$ are the transition rates from state $i$ to state $j$.\n\n2.  **Identify a Typo in the Equations:** The standard form for the Kolmogorov forward equation for $P_j'(t)$ is $\\sum_{i \\neq j} \\lambda_{ij}P_i(t) - (\\sum_{k \\neq j} \\lambda_{jk})P_j(t)$. The term $\\lambda_{ij}P_i(t)$ represents the flow of probability *into* state $j$ from state $i$ and should thus be positive. The given equation for $P_1'(t)$ is:\n    $P_{1}'(t) = -\\lambda_{01}P_{0}(t) - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12})P_{1}(t) + \\lambda_{21}P_{2}(t) + \\lambda_{31}P_{3}(t)$\n    The first term, $-\\lambda_{01}P_{0}(t)$, has a negative sign, which contradicts the model of a Markov process. A flow from state 0 to state 1 should increase $P_1$. Furthermore, the sum of all derivatives $\\sum_{i=0}^3 P_i'(t)$ must be zero because the total probability $\\sum P_i(t) = 1$ is constant. The given equations yield a sum of $-2\\lambda_{01}P_0(t)$, which is not zero. We must assume a typo and correct the sign.\n    The corrected equation for $P_1'(t)$ is:\n    $P_{1}'(t) = \\lambda_{01}P_{0}(t) - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12})P_{1}(t) + \\lambda_{21}P_{2}(t) + \\lambda_{31}P_{3}(t)$\n\n3.  **Find the Steady-State (Limiting) Probabilities:** We are interested in the probabilities as $t \\to +\\infty$. In this limit, the system reaches a steady state where the probabilities are constant, i.e., $P_i(+\\infty) = P_i$ and $P_i'(t) = 0$ for all $i$. Setting the derivatives to zero gives us the balance equations:\n    (1) $0 = -\\lambda_{01}P_{0} + \\lambda_{10}P_{1}$\n    (2) $0 = \\lambda_{01}P_{0} - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12})P_{1} + \\lambda_{21}P_{2} + \\lambda_{31}P_{3}$\n    (3) $0 = \\lambda_{12}P_{1} - (\\lambda_{21} + \\lambda_{23})P_{2}$\n    (4) $0 = \\lambda_{23}P_{2} - \\lambda_{31}P_{3}$\n\n    These equations must be solved together with the normalization condition:\n    (5) $P_{0} + P_{1} + P_{2} + P_{3} = 1$\n\n4.  **Solve the System of Equations:** We can express $P_0$, $P_2$, and $P_3$ in terms of $P_1$.\n    *   From equation (1):\n        $\\lambda_{01}P_{0} = \\lambda_{10}P_{1} \\implies P_0 = \\frac{\\lambda_{10}}{\\lambda_{01}} P_1$\n    *   From equation (3):\n        $(\\lambda_{21} + \\lambda_{23})P_{2} = \\lambda_{12}P_{1} \\implies P_2 = \\frac{\\lambda_{12}}{\\lambda_{21} + \\lambda_{23}} P_1$\n    *   From equation (4):\n        $\\lambda_{31}P_{3} = \\lambda_{23}P_{2} \\implies P_3 = \\frac{\\lambda_{23}}{\\lambda_{31}} P_2$\n\n5.  **Substitute the Given Numerical Values:**\n    $\\lambda_{01} = 0.019$, $\\lambda_{10} = 0.65$, $\\lambda_{12} = 0.4$, $\\lambda_{21} = 0.392$, $\\lambda_{23} = 0.008$, $\\lambda_{31} = 0.008$\n    *   $P_0 = \\frac{0.65}{0.019} P_1$\n    *   For $P_2$: $\\lambda_{21} + \\lambda_{23} = 0.392 + 0.008 = 0.4$.\n        $P_2 = \\frac{0.4}{0.4} P_1 = P_1$\n    *   For $P_3$: Since $P_2 = P_1$, we have $P_3 = \\frac{\\lambda_{23}}{\\lambda_{31}} P_2 = \\frac{0.008}{0.008} P_2 = P_2$. Therefore, $P_3 = P_1$.\n    We have found the relationships: $P_0 = \\frac{0.65}{0.019}P_1$, and $P_2 = P_3 = P_1$.\n\n6.  **Use the Normalization Condition to Find P1:**\n    Substitute these relationships into the normalization equation (5):\n    $P_0 + P_1 + P_2 + P_3 = 1$\n    $\\left(\\frac{0.65}{0.019} P_1\\right) + P_1 + P_1 + P_1 = 1$\n    $P_1 \\left(\\frac{0.65}{0.019} + 3\\right) = 1$\n    $P_1 \\left(\\frac{0.65 + 3 \\times 0.019}{0.019}\\right) = 1$\n    $P_1 \\left(\\frac{0.65 + 0.057}{0.019}\\right) = 1$\n    $P_1 \\left(\\frac{0.707}{0.019}\\right) = 1$\n    $P_1 = \\frac{0.019}{0.707}$\n\n7.  **Calculate the Required Quantity $P_0 + P_1$:**\n    We want to find $P_0(+\\infty) + P_1(+\\infty) = P_0 + P_1$.\n    Using the relationship $P_0 = \\frac{0.65}{0.019} P_1$:\n    $P_0 + P_1 = \\left(\\frac{0.65}{0.019} P_1\\right) + P_1 = P_1 \\left(\\frac{0.65}{0.019} + 1\\right)$\n    $P_0 + P_1 = P_1 \\left(\\frac{0.65 + 0.019}{0.019}\\right) = P_1 \\left(\\frac{0.669}{0.019}\\right)$\n    Now, substitute the value we found for $P_1$:\n    $P_0 + P_1 = \\left(\\frac{0.019}{0.707}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{0.669}{0.019}\\right)$\n    The terms $0.019$ cancel out:\n    $P_0 + P_1 = \\frac{0.669}{0.707}$\n\n8.  **Final Calculation:**\n    $P_0 + P_1 = \\frac{669}{707} \\approx 0.946251768...$\n    Rounding to four decimal places, the answer is 0.9463."
