    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the first statute in the modern State of Israel that explicitly introduced the concept of \"good faith\".\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The key elements are:\n    *   **\"First statute\"**: We are looking for the earliest law chronologically.\n    *   **\"Modern State of Israel\"**: This limits our search to laws passed after the state's establishment in 1948. Laws from the preceding British Mandate period are not the direct answer, unless they were re-enacted as Israeli statutes.\n    *   **\"Explicitly introduce\"**: The statute must use the specific term \"good faith\". In Hebrew, this is \"תום לב\" (*tom lev*). A law that merely implies the principle is not sufficient.\n    *   **\"Concept of 'good faith'\"**: This refers to the legal principle of honesty, fairness, and sincerity in dealings.\n\n2.  **Initial Brainstorming and Common Knowledge:**\n    *   The most famous Israeli law concerning \"good faith\" is the **Contracts (General Part) Law, 1973**. Its sections 12 and 39 established good faith as a fundamental, overarching principle in negotiations and contract performance.\n    *   However, the question asks for the *first* statute, not the most famous or most significant one. Therefore, we must investigate if any laws passed between 1948 and 1973 included the term.\n\n3.  **Investigating Pre-1973 Statutes:**\n    *   A review of Israeli civil legislation enacted before 1973 reveals several statutes that explicitly mention \"good faith\" in specific contexts. These include:\n        *   **Agency Law, 1965**: Section 8 requires an agent to act with loyalty and in \"good faith\".\n        *   **Sale Law, 1968**: Section 34 protects a buyer who purchased goods in \"good faith\" from a seller who did not have title (a rule similar to \"market overt\").\n        *   **Land Law, 1969**: Section 10 protects a person who acquires rights to land by relying in \"good faith\" on the official land registry.\n\n4.  **Searching for an Earlier Statute:**\n    *   The laws from 1965, 1968, and 1969 all post-date another significant piece of legislation.\n    *   In 1957, Israel enacted the **Bills of Exchange Ordinance [New Version]**. This was part of a project to re-organize and republish mandatory-era legislation as modern Israeli law. While its origins are from the British Mandate, its enactment as a \"[New Version]\" makes it a statute of the modern State of Israel.\n    *   Section 29(1) of this ordinance defines a \"holder in due course\" of a bill of exchange. One of the key requirements is that the holder took the bill \"**in good faith**\" (*be-tom lev*).\n\n5.  **Conclusion and Final Answer Derivation:**\n    *   Comparing the dates, the Bills of Exchange Ordinance [New Version] from **1957** is the earliest of the identified statutes.\n    *   It explicitly uses the term \"good faith\" (*tom lev*) in a key definition.\n    *   Therefore, it predates the other civil law statutes of the 1960s and the landmark Contracts Law of 1973.\n    *   As per the user's instructions, we must remove \"the\" from the beginning and the year from the end.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n\n*   **\"First\" vs. \"Most Important\"**: It's crucial not to confuse the first statute to *mention* the term with the first statute to make it a *general principle*. The 1973 Contracts Law did the latter, but the 1957 Bills of Exchange Ordinance did the former.\n*   **\"New Version\" Statutes**: Understanding that a \"[New Version]\" of a Mandatory Ordinance counts as a modern Israeli statute is key to identifying the correct law and date.\n*   **Explicit Language**: The analysis must focus only on laws that use the literal term \"good faith,\" as requested by the question's use of \"explicitly.\"\n\nThe final answer is the name of the statute identified in Step 4, formatted according to the instructions.\n\n<<<Bills of Exchange Ordinance [New Version]>>>"
