    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the name of the value used to compute Heart Rate Variability (HRV).\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The core of the question is to identify the name of the measurement taken \"between heartbeats\" which is then used to calculate HRV. The prompt specifies that this is captured using PPG (Photoplethysmography).\n\n2.  **Understand Heartbeats and Intervals:** A heartbeat is a single cardiac cycle. The time from one specific point in a cardiac cycle to the same point in the next cycle is the fundamental measurement. This measurement is an interval of time, typically measured in milliseconds (ms).\n\n3.  **Identify the General Term:** The most common and general term for the time duration between two consecutive heartbeats is the **Inter-Beat Interval**, often abbreviated as **IBI**.\n\n4.  **Consider the Measurement Technology (ECG vs. PPG):**\n    *   **ECG (Electrocardiogram):** This is the clinical gold standard. It measures the electrical activity of the heart. The most prominent peak in the ECG waveform is the \"R-peak\". Therefore, the time interval between two consecutive R-peaks is called the **R-R interval**. The R-R interval is a specific type of IBI.\n    *   **PPG (Photoplethysmography):** As mentioned in the question, PPG measures changes in blood volume. The signal from a PPG device shows a pulse wave with a peak for each heartbeat. The time between these consecutive peaks is sometimes called the **peak-to-peak interval (P-P interval)**. However, it is functionally measuring the same thing as the R-R interval and is most commonly referred to by the general term, Inter-Beat Interval (IBI).\n\n5.  **Distinguish from HRV:** It is crucial to understand that the IBI (or R-R interval) is the *raw data point*. **HRV is not the interval itself**. HRV refers to the statistical analysis and quantification of the *variations* in a sequence of these IBIs. For example, metrics like RMSSD (Root Mean Square of Successive Differences) and SDNN (Standard Deviation of NN intervals) are calculated from a collection of IBIs to represent HRV.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **The value is a time interval:** The value measured is not a rate (like beats per minute) but a duration (like milliseconds).\n*   **IBI is the raw data:** HRV metrics are derived *from* a series of IBIs. The IBI is the input, and HRV is the output of the calculation.\n*   **R-R Interval vs. IBI:** \"R-R Interval\" is specific to ECG measurements. \"Inter-Beat Interval (IBI)\" is the more general term that applies to any technology measuring the time between beats, including PPG. Given the context, IBI is the most appropriate and comprehensive answer.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe value computed between heartbeats, which serves as the fundamental data for calculating HRV, is the time duration between those beats. This is most accurately and generally called the Inter-Beat Interval (IBI).\n\n<<<Inter-Beat Interval (IBI)"
