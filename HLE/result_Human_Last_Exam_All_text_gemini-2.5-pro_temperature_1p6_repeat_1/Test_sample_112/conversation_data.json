    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Core Components of the Question**\nThe question asks to identify a \"book of manners\" that was \"preserved alongside\" the poem \"Sir Launfal.\" This implies that both texts exist together in the same historical document, most likely a single medieval manuscript.\n\n**Step 2: Identify \"Sir Launfal\" and its Manuscript**\n*   \"Sir Launfal\" is a well-known Middle English romance poem written by Thomas Chestre in the late 14th century.\n*   Crucially, this poem survives in only one manuscript. The survival of both texts in the same place is the key to the answer.\n*   This manuscript is identified by its library shelfmark: **Cotton MS Caligula A.ii**, which is part of the Cotton collection held at the British Library.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Contents of Manuscript Cotton MS Caligula A.ii**\n*   This manuscript is a miscellany, which is a collection of various unrelated texts bound together.\n*   Besides \"Sir Launfal,\" it contains several other significant Middle English works, such as the longer version of Layamon's *Brut* and the famous debate poem *The Owl and the Nightingale*.\n*   To answer the question, we must look through the full list of contents for a text that fits the description of a \"book of manners.\"\n\n**Step 4: Identify the \"Book of Manners\" within the Manuscript**\n*   A \"book of manners,\" or courtesy book, is a didactic text that teaches social etiquette, table manners, and proper conduct, often aimed at children or young people entering courtly society.\n*   Upon examining the contents of Cotton MS Caligula A.ii, we find a short poem that perfectly fits this description.\n*   This poem is a set of instructions for children on how to behave properly. While it has been referred to by various titles, one of the most common is **\"The Lytylle Childrenes Lytil Boke\"** (The Little Children's Little Book). It is also sometimes generically called \"The Book of Courtesy.\"\n\n**Conclusion**\nBy identifying the unique manuscript that contains \"Sir Launfal\" and then examining its other contents, we can pinpoint the specific book of manners it was preserved alongside. The answer is the short didactic poem on etiquette for children found within Cotton MS Caligula A.ii.\n\n<<<The Lytylle Childrenes Lytil Boke>>>"
