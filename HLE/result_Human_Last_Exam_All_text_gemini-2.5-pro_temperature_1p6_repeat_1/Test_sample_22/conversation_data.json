    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the statement.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Define SNP Heritability (h²_SNP):**\n    *   SNP heritability is a population parameter that quantifies the proportion of the total variation in a phenotype (a trait or disease) that can be explained by the additive effects of all common Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) across the genome.\n    *   Crucially, this is a theoretical concept. It represents the *upper limit* or *ceiling* of predictive power that could possibly be achieved if we knew the *true* causal effect size of every single SNP and used them all perfectly in a predictive model.\n\n2.  **Define a Polygenic Score (PGS) and its Predictive Ability:**\n    *   A Polygenic Score (also known as a Polygenic Risk Score, PRS) is a practical tool used to predict an individual's phenotype.\n    *   It is calculated by taking a weighted sum of an individual's genotypes at many different SNP locations.\n    *   The \"weights\" used in this sum are the effect sizes for each SNP. However, these are not the true, unknown effect sizes. Instead, they are *estimates* derived from a Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS).\n    *   The predictive ability of a PGS is measured by how well it correlates with the actual phenotype in an independent test sample. This is often quantified as the R-squared (R²), which is the proportion of variance in the phenotype that the PGS can explain.\n\n3.  **Compare the Foundation of h²_SNP and R²_PGS:**\n    *   **h²_SNP:** Based on *true*, unknown effect sizes of *all* SNPs. It is the total available signal.\n    *   **R²_PGS:** Based on *estimated* effect sizes from a finite GWAS sample. It is the signal we can practically *capture*.\n\n4.  **Identify Reasons Why R²_PGS is Lower than h²_SNP:**\n    *   **Estimation Error:** Any GWAS is conducted on a finite number of people. This means that the effect size calculated for each SNP is just an estimate, and it will have some degree of error compared to the true effect size. When these noisy estimates are used to build the PGS, its predictive accuracy is degraded. The predictive accuracy of a PGS increases with the size of the GWAS used to generate the weights, but it only approaches the SNP heritability as the sample size approaches infinity.\n    *   **Incomplete SNP Inclusion:** Most simple PGS models are built using only the SNPs that reach a specific threshold of statistical significance in the GWAS (e.g., p < 5x10⁻⁸). This means that thousands of other SNPs that have real, albeit smaller, effects on the phenotype are completely left out of the model. This omission of real signal necessarily lowers the predictive ability of the PGS compared to the theoretical h²_SNP, which accounts for all SNPs.\n    *   **Mismatched Conditions:** The predictive ability can be further reduced if the population used to test the PGS has a different genetic ancestry or is in a different environment than the population used for the original GWAS, due to differences in linkage disequilibrium (LD) patterns and gene-environment interactions. SNP heritability itself is a population-specific parameter.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe SNP heritability (h²_SNP) represents the total amount of phenotypic variance that is theoretically explainable by common SNPs. A polygenic score is a real-world predictor that attempts to harness this explanatory power using imperfect information (estimated effect sizes from a finite GWAS). Due to the unavoidable noise and incompleteness in the data used to build it, a PGS can only ever capture a fraction of the total theoretical signal. Therefore, its predictive ability (R²) is necessarily lower than the SNP heritability. The two values would only become equal in the impossible scenario of an infinitely large and perfect GWAS.\n\n<<<True>>>"
