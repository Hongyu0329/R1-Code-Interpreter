    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Core Question:** The question asks for the minimum length of a symmetric encryption key to be secure against a theoretical, powerful quantum computer.\n\n2.  **Identify the Target System:** The system is symmetric key cryptography. In this system, the same key is used for both encryption and decryption. A common example is the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES).\n\n3.  **Identify the Primary Classical Attack:** For a well-designed symmetric cipher, the most effective attack is a brute-force search. This involves trying every possible key until the correct one is found. For a key of `n` bits, there are `2^n` possible keys. Classically, this would require, on average, `2^(n-1)` attempts, with a worst-case complexity of `O(2^n)`. A 128-bit key (`2^128` combinations) is considered secure against classical computers.\n\n4.  **Identify the Primary Quantum Attack:** Quantum computers can run algorithms that are significantly faster for certain problems. For the problem of searching an unsorted database (which is what a brute-force attack on a key space is), the most relevant algorithm is **Grover's algorithm**.\n\n5.  **Analyze the Impact of Grover's Algorithm:** Grover's algorithm provides a quadratic speedup over classical search algorithms.\n    *   A classical computer takes `O(N)` steps to search a space of `N` items.\n    *   A quantum computer using Grover's algorithm takes `O(√N)` steps.\n    *   For a symmetric key of `n` bits, the search space `N` is `2^n`.\n    *   Therefore, the complexity of a quantum brute-force attack is `O(√(2^n))`, which simplifies to `O(2^(n/2))`.\n\n6.  **Quantify the Reduction in Security:** This quadratic speedup means that a quantum computer effectively halves the security strength of a symmetric key in terms of bits. A key of length `n` provides `n` bits of classical security but only `n/2` bits of quantum security.\n    *   For a 128-bit key, the quantum security level is `128 / 2 = 64` bits.\n    *   For a 256-bit key, the quantum security level is `256 / 2 = 128` bits.\n\n7.  **Establish the Security Benchmark:** The generally accepted minimum security level for data that needs to be secure for the long term is **128 bits**. This means that an attacker should have to perform a number of operations on the order of `2^128` to break the encryption. A security level of 64 bits (`2^64` operations) is considered breakable and is not secure enough.\n\n8.  **Calculate the Required Key Length:** To achieve a 128-bit security level *against a quantum computer*, the key length `n` must satisfy the following condition:\n    `Quantum Security Level ≥ 128 bits`\n    `n / 2 ≥ 128`\n    `n ≥ 256`\n\n9.  **Conclusion:** A symmetric key must be at least **256 bits** long to provide a 128-bit level of security against an attack by a powerful quantum computer using Grover's algorithm.\n\n### Summary of Careful Points\n\n*   **Symmetric vs. Asymmetric Keys:** The question is specifically about symmetric keys. The impact of quantum computers on asymmetric keys (like RSA) is much more severe due to Shor's algorithm, which would necessitate entirely different cryptographic systems.\n*   **Grover's Algorithm:** This is the key algorithm to consider for brute-force attacks. It provides a quadratic, not an exponential, speedup.\n*   **Security Level Benchmark:** The choice of 128 bits as the \"secure\" benchmark is a widely accepted standard in modern cryptography.\n*   **\"At Least\":** The question asks for the minimum length. While a 512-bit key would also be secure (providing 256 bits of quantum security), 256 bits is the minimum required to meet the 128-bit security threshold.\n\nBased on the analysis, a 256-bit symmetric key is required to maintain a 128-bit security level in the face of a quantum attack.\n\n<<<A>>>"
