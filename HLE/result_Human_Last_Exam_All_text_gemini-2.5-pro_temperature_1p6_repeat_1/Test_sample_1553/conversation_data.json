    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the key elements of the question.**\n*   **Novel:** \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość\" (Perfect Imperfection)\n*   **Author:** Jacek Dukaj\n*   **Task:** Identify the name of the character whom the main character marries.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the main character of the novel.**\nThe protagonist of Jacek Dukaj's \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość\" is Adam Zamoyski, a man from the 21st century who has been cryogenically frozen and is resurrected in the distant future.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the main character's relationships and plot progression.**\nUpon his revival, Adam Zamoyski is lost and overwhelmed by the technologically and evolutionarily advanced post-human civilization. He is assigned a guide, a powerful and enigmatic post-human entity. This entity becomes his protector, mentor, and primary companion.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the character with whom a marriage or formal union occurs.**\nThe guide assigned to Adam Zamoyski is named Angelina. Their relationship evolves throughout the novel from one of a guide and a ward to a deep, complex partnership. To formalize their bond and grant Adam a more secure standing in this future society, they undergo a form of union that is the novel's equivalent of a marriage.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   **The nature of \"marriage\":** In the context of this far-future, post-human setting, the concept of marriage is not a traditional human ceremony. It's a more abstract and technologically profound union of two beings. However, it serves the narrative and social function of a marriage.\n*   **Character identification:** It is crucial to correctly identify the main character (Adam Zamoyski) and his most significant partner (Angelina). Angelina is the character with whom he forms this formal, marriage-like bond.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBy following the main character's journey, we can determine that the person he forms a marital union with is his post-human guide, Angelina.\n\n<<<Angelina>>>"
