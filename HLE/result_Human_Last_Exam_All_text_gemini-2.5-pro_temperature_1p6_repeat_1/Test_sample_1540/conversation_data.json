    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the most memory-efficient C program and calculate its variable memory usage.\n\n### Step 1: Problem Understanding\n\nThe task is to compare two strings of the same length lexicographically. The key constraint is that the comparison must be case-insensitive, meaning 'a' is equivalent to 'A'. The goal is to find a solution that uses the minimum possible memory for its variables and to report that memory usage in bytes.\n\n*   **Input**: Two strings of equal length (1 to 100 characters), each on a new line.\n*   **Comparison**: Lexicographical, case-insensitive.\n*   **Output**:\n    *   \"-1\" if the first string is less than the second.\n    *   \"1\" if the first string is greater than the second.\n    *   \"0\" if the strings are equal.\n*   **Primary Objective**: Minimize memory usage for variables.\n\n### Step 2: Brainstorming Solutions and Memory Trade-offs\n\nThe main consumer of memory in this problem will be the storage for the input strings.\n\n*   **Approach A: Standard Method (Higher Memory)**\n    The most straightforward approach is to declare two character arrays, each large enough to hold the longest possible string (100 characters plus a null terminator).\n    ```c\n    char s1[101];\n    char s2[101];\n    ```\n    Then, we would read both strings using `scanf(\"%s %s\", s1, s2);` and iterate through them, comparing characters after converting them to a common case (e.g., lowercase using `tolower()`).\n    *   **Memory Cost**: This approach requires `101 + 101 = 202` bytes just for the string buffers, plus a few extra bytes for loop counters.\n\n*   **Approach B: Memory-Optimized Method (Lower Memory)**\n    To minimize memory, we should avoid storing both strings if possible. The input format consists of the first string, followed by a newline, then the second string. This means we must finish reading the first string before we can begin reading the second. Therefore, we absolutely must store the first string in a buffer.\n    However, we can process the second string character-by-character as we read it from the input stream, comparing it immediately against the corresponding character in our stored first string. This eliminates the need for a second buffer.\n\n### Step 3: Designing the Most Memory-Efficient Program\n\nThe most memory-efficient solution follows Approach B. Here's the detailed design:\n\n1.  **Read First String**: Use a loop with `getchar()` to read characters from standard input until a newline `\\n` is encountered. Store these characters in a buffer `s1`.\n2.  **Read and Compare Second String**: Use a second loop with `getchar()` to read the characters of the second string. As each character is read, immediately perform a case-insensitive comparison with the corresponding character in the `s1` buffer.\n3.  **Immediate Exit**: If a difference is found between characters, print \"-1\" or \"1\" and terminate the program immediately. This is efficient as it avoids unnecessary processing.\n4.  **Equality**: If the loop finishes without finding any differences, the strings are equal. Print \"0\".\n\n### Step 4: Careful Points and Variable Selection\n\nTo achieve the absolute minimum memory usage, we must select the smallest possible data type for each variable.\n\n1.  **First String Buffer (`s1`)**: A character array is needed. Since the max length is 100, we need a size of 101 to be safe and accommodate a potential null terminator.\n    *   `char s1[101];` -> `101 * sizeof(char)` = **101 bytes**.\n\n2.  **Character Input Variable (`c`)**: The `getchar()` function returns an `int`, not a `char`. This is crucial because it needs to represent every possible character value as well as a special value `EOF` (End Of File). Using a `char` variable here would be a bug.\n    *   `int c;` -> `1 * sizeof(int)` = **4 bytes** (on typical 32/64-bit systems used in competitive programming).\n\n3.  **Loop Index (`i`)**: We need an index to traverse the `s1` buffer. This index will range from 0 up to a maximum of 100. An `int` (4 bytes) or `size_t` would work, but a more memory-efficient choice is `unsigned char`, which can store values from 0 to 255 and only uses 1 byte. A pointer would use 4 or 8 bytes, making it less efficient than `unsigned char`.\n    *   `unsigned char i;` -> `1 * sizeof(unsigned char)` = **1 byte**.\n\n### Step 5: Final Memory Calculation\n\nThe total memory `m` used for variables in the most memory-efficient C program is the sum of the sizes of the variables identified above.\n\n*   Memory for `s1`: 101 bytes\n*   Memory for `c`: 4 bytes\n*   Memory for `i`: 1 byte\n\nTotal Memory (`m`) = 101 + 4 + 1 = 106 bytes.\n\nThis approach is correct, robust for the given input format, and minimizes memory usage by avoiding a second large buffer and choosing the smallest appropriate data types for auxiliary variables.\n\n<<<106>>>"
