    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the key elements of the question.**\n*   **Artist:** Curt Querner\n*   **Year:** 1933\n*   **Artwork:** A self-portrait\n*   **Context:** Painted after escaping from the Gestapo.\n*   **Question:** What object does he hold in his hand as a symbol of resistance?\n\n**Step 2: Research the specific painting and its historical context.**\n*   Curt Querner was a German painter associated with the New Objectivity movement.\n*   He was also a member of the Communist Party of Germany (KPD).\n*   In March 1933, shortly after the Nazis came to power, he was arrested by the Gestapo for his political affiliations and briefly imprisoned in Hohnstein concentration camp, from which he escaped.\n*   Immediately following this experience, he painted a powerful self-portrait, often titled \"Selbstbildnis mit rotem Tuch\" (Self-Portrait with a Red Cloth).\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the visual elements of the painting.**\n*   The portrait shows Querner with a tense, defiant expression, looking directly at the viewer.\n*   In his hand, he is clutching a vibrant **red cloth** or scarf.\n\n**Step 4: Interpret the symbolism of the object within the given context.**\n*   The color red has long been the primary symbol of communism, socialism, and the workers' movement. The Red Flag is the most prominent example.\n*   Querner was arrested specifically for his communist beliefs.\n*   By holding a red cloth so prominently in a self-portrait made immediately after escaping the Nazis, he was making a clear and dangerous political statement.\n*   The act of holding the red cloth symbolizes his unbroken spirit, his continued allegiance to his political convictions, and his defiance against the Nazi regime that had just persecuted him. It is a potent and unambiguous symbol of resistance.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the analysis, the object Curt Querner holds in his 1933 self-portrait is a red cloth, which symbolizes his defiant commitment to his communist ideals in the face of Nazi persecution.\n\n<<<In his 1933 self-portrait, Curt Querner holds a red cloth as a symbol of resistance.>>>"
