    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe question asks for the ratio of the uncertainty in an electron's momentum ($\\Delta p$) to its actual momentum ($p$) while it is in the first Bohr orbit. We need to find the value of $\\frac{\\Delta p}{p}$.\n\n**2. Identify Given Information and Necessary Constants**\n*   **System:** An electron in the first Bohr orbit ($n=1$).\n*   **Given Data:** The uncertainty in the electron's position, $\\Delta x = 10 \\text{ pm}$.\n*   **Necessary Constants:**\n    *   Reduced Planck's constant, $\\hbar \\approx 1.054 \\times 10^{-34} \\text{ J}\\cdot\\text{s}$.\n    *   Radius of the first Bohr orbit, $r_1$ (also known as the Bohr radius, $a_0$) $\\approx 5.29 \\times 10^{-11} \\text{ m}$.\n\n**3. List Relevant Physical Principles and Formulas**\n*   **Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle:** This principle relates the uncertainty in position ($\\Delta x$) and the uncertainty in momentum ($\\Delta p$). The relationship is given by $\\Delta x \\cdot \\Delta p \\ge \\frac{\\hbar}{2}$. For calculating the minimum uncertainty, we use the equality:\n    $\\Delta x \\cdot \\Delta p = \\frac{\\hbar}{2}$\n\n*   **Bohr's Model for Momentum:** The Bohr model quantizes the angular momentum ($L$) of an electron in an orbit: $L = mvr = n\\hbar$. Since linear momentum is $p = mv$, we can write this as $pr = n\\hbar$. For the first Bohr orbit ($n=1$), the momentum is:\n    $p = \\frac{1 \\cdot \\hbar}{r_1} = \\frac{\\hbar}{r_1}$\n\n**4. Formulate the Solution Strategy**\n\n*   **Part A: Find an expression for the uncertainty in momentum, $\\Delta p$.**\n    *   Rearrange the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle formula to solve for $\\Delta p$.\n\n*   **Part B: Find an expression for the momentum, $p$.**\n    *   Use the Bohr model formula for the momentum of an electron in the first orbit.\n\n*   **Part C: Calculate the ratio $\\frac{\\Delta p}{p}$.**\n    *   Divide the expression for $\\Delta p$ by the expression for $p$.\n    *   Substitute the numerical values for the known quantities ($\\Delta x$ and $r_1$) to get the final answer.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Unit Consistency:** The given uncertainty in position is in picometers (pm). It must be converted to the SI unit, meters (m), to be consistent with the other constants.\n    *   $1 \\text{ pm} = 10^{-12} \\text{ m}$, so $10 \\text{ pm} = 10 \\times 10^{-12} \\text{ m} = 1 \\times 10^{-11} \\text{ m}$.\n\n2.  **Use of Constants:** While the value of $\\hbar$ is required conceptually, we will see that it cancels out during the calculation of the ratio, simplifying the problem and reducing potential rounding errors.\n\n3.  **Distinguishing Physical Quantities:** It is crucial not to confuse the radius of the orbit ($r_1$) with the uncertainty in position ($\\Delta x$). They are distinct physical quantities.\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer\n\n**Step 1: Derive the expression for $\\Delta p$.**\nFrom the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle:\n$\\Delta p = \\frac{\\hbar}{2 \\Delta x}$\n\n**Step 2: Derive the expression for $p$.**\nFrom the Bohr model for the first orbit ($n=1$):\n$p = \\frac{\\hbar}{r_1}$\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the ratio $\\frac{\\Delta p}{p}$.**\nSubstitute the expressions from the previous steps:\n$\\frac{\\Delta p}{p} = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{\\hbar}{2 \\Delta x}\\right)}{\\left(\\frac{\\hbar}{r_1}\\right)}$\n\nSimplify the complex fraction. The $\\hbar$ term cancels out:\n$\\frac{\\Delta p}{p} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2 \\Delta x} \\cdot \\frac{r_1}{\\hbar} = \\frac{r_1}{2 \\Delta x}$\n\n**Step 4: Substitute the numerical values.**\n*   $r_1 = 5.29 \\times 10^{-11} \\text{ m}$\n*   $\\Delta x = 10 \\text{ pm} = 1 \\times 10^{-11} \\text{ m}$\n\nNow, plug these values into the simplified ratio:\n$\\frac{\\Delta p}{p} = \\frac{5.29 \\times 10^{-11} \\text{ m}}{2 \\times (1 \\times 10^{-11} \\text{ m})}$\n$\\frac{\\Delta p}{p} = \\frac{5.29}{2}$\n$\\frac{\\Delta p}{p} = 2.645$\n\nThe ratio is a dimensionless quantity.\n\n<<<2.645>>>"
