    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the question:** The question asks to identify which of the given animals has a hearing range capable of detecting the sound produced by human muscle twitches.\n\n2.  **Determine the frequency of human muscle twitches:** When a human muscle contracts or tenses, it produces a very low-frequency vibration or sound. This sound is a form of infrasound, with a frequency typically in the range of 10 to 25 Hz. This is at or below the lowest threshold of normal human hearing.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the hearing range of each animal in the answer choices:**\n    *   **A. Dog:** The hearing range for a dog is approximately 67 Hz to 45,000 Hz. Their hearing is excellent for high frequencies but does not extend down into the 10-25 Hz infrasound range. Therefore, a dog cannot hear muscle twitches.\n    *   **B. Bat:** Bats are masters of echolocation and specialize in hearing extremely high frequencies (ultrasound), typically from 20,000 Hz up to 200,000 Hz. They are not equipped to hear very low frequencies (infrasound). Therefore, a bat cannot hear muscle twitches.\n    *   **C. Herring:** This species of fish, along with others in its family (clupeids), has a highly specialized and remarkable auditory system. They possess a direct connection between their gas-filled swim bladder (which acts like a sound-pressure receiver) and their inner ear. This adaptation grants them an exceptionally wide hearing range, allowing them to detect not only high-frequency ultrasound but also extremely low-frequency infrasound, sometimes below 1 Hz. This ability is believed to serve as an early warning system to detect the low-frequency sounds generated by the muscle movements of approaching predators. Since muscle twitches fall within this low-frequency range, a herring could likely detect them.\n    *   **D. Whale:** Certain types of whales, particularly baleen whales like the blue whale and fin whale, are known for their ability to communicate and hear at very low frequencies, sometimes as low as 10 Hz. This means it is plausible that a whale could hear human muscle twitches. However, the herring's adaptation is particularly specialized for detecting the faint, low-frequency sounds associated with muscle movement in water.\n    *   **E. Human:** The standard range of human hearing is 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz. Since muscle twitches produce sound around 10-25 Hz, this is at the absolute lowest limit or below what most humans can perceive. While some individuals might be able to hear a rumbling by tensing a muscle right next to their eardrum, it is not something humans can generally hear.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** Comparing all the options, the herring has the most famously and specifically adapted auditory system for detecting the type of low-frequency sounds produced by muscle movements. While some whales might also be able to, the herring is a classic example of an animal with this capability, making it the best answer.\n\n<<<C>>>"
