**Specific Procedures for Management:**
1.  **Immediate Phase:** Prioritize systemic health with an urgent referral to an internist/endocrinologist to begin treatment for diabetes. In parallel, provide dental urgent care including wound irrigation, suturing of lacerations, prescribing antibiotics and analgesics, and administering a tetanus booster.
2.  **Healing Phase:** Allow 3-4 months for socket healing. During this time, the patient's glycemic control must be optimized (target HbA1c < 7.0%). An interim acrylic partial denture ("flipper") can be provided for aesthetic purposes.
3.  **Definitive Phase:** After healing and medical stabilization, the most appropriate management is prosthetic rehabilitation with a Removable Partial Denture.

**Cells of Interest:**
The cells of primary interest are those whose function is compromised by uncontrolled diabetes, leading to impaired wound healing: **Fibroblasts** (reduced collagen synthesis), **Osteoblasts** (reduced bone formation), **Endothelial cells** (impaired angiogenesis), and **Neutrophils/Macrophages** (dysregulated inflammation).

**Denture Replacement Plan:**
*   **Kind of Denture:** A **Cast Metal Framework Removable Partial Denture (RPD)**.
*   **Material:** The framework should be made of a **Cobalt-Chromium alloy**, with teeth and a gingival base made from **acrylic resin**.
*   **Abutment Teeth:** The abutment teeth will be the **left central incisor (#9)** and **left second premolar (#13)** as primary abutments. Critically, the **right canine (#6)** and **right first premolar (#5)** should also be engaged as abutments.
*   **Reasons:** This design is chosen for optimal **Support** (directing forces to teeth via rests), **Retention** (holding the denture in place with clasps), and **Stability**. Engaging teeth on the opposite side provides essential **cross-arch stabilization**, preventing rocking forces and making the denture stable and functional, which is especially important given the loss of the key left canine and the patient's Class III skeletal pattern.
