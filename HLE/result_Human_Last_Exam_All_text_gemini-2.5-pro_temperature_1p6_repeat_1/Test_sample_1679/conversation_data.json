    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the first Best Picture winner to depict a Luxor Obelisk.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Key Elements of the Question**\n\n*   **\"Academy Award for Best Picture\":** We need to consider only the winners of this specific award.\n*   **\"Luxor Obelisk\":** There are two identical obelisks carved from the Luxor Temple in Egypt.\n    1.  One remains at the entrance to the Luxor Temple in Luxor, Egypt.\n    2.  The other was gifted to France in the 19th century and now stands in the center of the Place de la Concorde in Paris.\n    The question is general, so a depiction of either obelisk qualifies.\n*   **\"Depict on-screen\":** The movie must contain a visual scene showing one of these two obelisks.\n*   **\"First winner\":** We must check the list of Best Picture winners in chronological order, starting from the first award in 1928, and stop at the first film that meets the criteria.\n\n**Step 2: Chronological Review of Best Picture Winners and Analysis**\n\nWe will proceed through the list of winners, looking for films set in either Paris, France, or Luxor, Egypt.\n\n*   **1920s - 1930s:** Winners like *Wings*, *The Broadway Melody*, *All Quiet on the Western Front*, *Cimarron*, *Grand Hotel*, *Cavalcade*, and *It Happened One Night* are set in locations like WWI battlefields, New York, Germany, the American West, Berlin, and London. None of these contain a Luxor Obelisk.\n*   ***The Life of Emile Zola* (Winner for 1937):** This film is set almost entirely in Paris. As a biopic about a major French figure, it's a potential candidate. However, its scenes primarily take place in interiors like courtrooms, offices, and apartments. While it's plausible an establishing shot of Paris might include the Place de la Concorde, there is no famous or clear scene that prominently features the obelisk. It is not definitively depicted.\n*   **1930s - 1940s:** Winners like *You Can't Take It with You*, *Gone with the Wind*, *Rebecca*, and *How Green Was My Valley* are set in New York, the American South, and Great Britain. None depict the obelisk.\n*   ***Casablanca* (Winner for 1943):** This film is famously set in Casablanca, Morocco, but contains iconic flashback scenes set in Paris. During the montage of Rick and Ilsa's romance in Paris, several landmarks are shown. The most prominent is the Arc de Triomphe. The Place de la Concorde is not clearly or memorably shown.\n*   **1940s (Post-*Casablanca*):** Winners like *Going My Way*, *The Lost Weekend*, *The Best Years of Our Lives*, *Gentleman's Agreement*, and *Hamlet* are set in New York, the American Midwest, and Denmark. They do not qualify.\n*   ***An American in Paris* (Winner for 1951):** The title itself points to the film's setting. The entire movie is a love letter to the city of Paris. Crucially, the film culminates in a famous, 17-minute-long abstract ballet sequence. This sequence visualizes a tour of Paris through sets inspired by French painters. One segment is explicitly set in the Place de la Concorde (in the style of Raoul Dufy), clearly depicting its famous fountains and the central Luxor Obelisk. This is a definite and intentional depiction.\n\n**Step 3: Conclusion of Analysis**\n\n*   We must find the *first* winner.\n*   While *The Life of Emile Zola* (1937) and *Casablanca* (1943) are set partially or wholly in Paris, their depiction of the specific landmark (the obelisk in the Place de la Concorde) is either non-existent or not clear and certain.\n*   *An American in Paris* (1951) contains an undeniable and celebrated on-screen depiction of the Place de la Concorde and its Luxor Obelisk.\n*   No winning films before this date were set in Luxor, Egypt, ruling out the other obelisk.\n*   Therefore, *An American in Paris* is the first Best Picture winner to definitively meet the condition.\n\n<<<An American in Paris>>>"
