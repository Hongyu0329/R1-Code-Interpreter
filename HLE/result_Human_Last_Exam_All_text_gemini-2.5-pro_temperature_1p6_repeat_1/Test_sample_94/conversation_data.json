    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the correct physicist.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe question asks to identify a specific person based on a set of clues:\n1.  The person is a **physicist**.\n2.  They are **better known for their work in microscopy**.\n3.  They **discovered an optical effect**.\n4.  This effect is related to **real imagery**.\n5.  The discovery was prompted by an **accidental observation made by a custodial worker**.\n6.  The worker was **cleaning concave mirrors** when they made the observation.\n\n**Step 2: List Careful Points and Key Clues**\n*   **The anecdote is the most distinctive clue:** The story about the custodial worker and the concave mirrors is very specific and is the key to solving the puzzle. A general search for physicists in microscopy would be too broad.\n*   **Microscopy focus:** The physicist's primary fame comes from inventing or significantly improving a microscope, not necessarily from the initial optical effect itself.\n*   **Concave mirrors:** This points towards equipment used either in telescopes or for creating focused beams of light, such as in spectrometers or certain types of condensers. The mirrors in this case were specifically being used as diffraction gratings.\n\n**Step 3: Step-by-Step Analysis to Find the Answer**\n1.  Let's focus on the most unique part of the question: the anecdote about the custodial worker and the concave mirror. Searching for this story in the history of science and optics brings up the Dutch physicist **Frits Zernike**.\n\n2.  Now, let's verify if Frits Zernike fits all the other criteria mentioned in the question.\n    *   **Is he a physicist?** Yes, Frits Zernike (1888â€“1966) was a Dutch physicist.\n    *   **Is he better known for work in microscopy?** Absolutely. Zernike won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1937 for his invention of the **phase-contrast microscope**. This invention was revolutionary because it allowed for the study of transparent biological specimens (like living cells) without the need for staining, which often kills the cells.\n    *   **Did he discover an optical effect in real imagery?** Yes. His Nobel-winning work was based on his discovery and manipulation of the phase of light. While investigating defects in diffraction gratings ruled on concave mirrors, he discovered that faint \"ghost\" images created by imperfections had a different phase from the main image. He realized that by manipulating this phase difference, he could make invisible phase variations visible as changes in brightness. This is the fundamental principle of phase contrast.\n    *   **Was the discovery linked to an accidental observation by a custodial worker cleaning concave mirrors?** Yes, this is a famous anecdote associated with Zernike. The story goes that at the University of Groningen's physics laboratory, a custodian noticed faint, unexpected spectral lines (known as Rowland ghosts) while cleaning the concave diffraction gratings. When this was brought to Zernike's attention, his investigation into the nature of these faint \"ghost\" images led him to his groundbreaking insights about the phase of light, which ultimately resulted in the phase-contrast microscope.\n\n3.  By matching every clue in the question to the history of Frits Zernike, we can confirm that he is the correct answer. His primary legacy is in microscopy, and the origin of his Nobel Prize-winning discovery is directly tied to the specific anecdote described.\n\n<<<Frits Zernike>>>"
