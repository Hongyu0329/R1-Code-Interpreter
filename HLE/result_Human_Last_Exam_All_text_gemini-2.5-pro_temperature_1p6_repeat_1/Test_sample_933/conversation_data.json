    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the coldest temperature for efficient synthesis of Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF₄).\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\nThe question asks for the coldest temperature from the given choices at which Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF₄) can be produced efficiently. The phrase \"using any method of synthesis\" is crucial, as it allows us to consider all known ways to make XeF₄. The term \"efficiently\" typically implies a process with a reasonably fast rate and a high yield, making it practical for laboratory preparation.\n\n**Step 2: Survey the Synthesis Methods for XeF₄**\nThere are several methods to synthesize XeF₄:\n\n1.  **Direct Thermal Synthesis from Elements:** This is the most common and widely taught method.\n    *   Reaction: `Xe(g) + 2F₂(g) → XeF₄(s)`\n    *   Conditions: This reaction is typically performed by heating a mixture of xenon and fluorine gas (in a mole ratio of approximately 1:5) in a sealed nickel or Monel vessel. The standard temperature cited for this method to proceed efficiently (i.e., good rate and yield) is **400°C** at a pressure of about 6 atmospheres.\n\n2.  **Catalytic Thermal Synthesis:** The direct reaction between Xe and F₂ can be made more efficient at lower temperatures by using a catalyst.\n    *   Reaction: `Xe(g) + 2F₂(g) --[NiF₂ catalyst]--> XeF₄(s)`\n    *   Conditions: Research has shown that with a nickel fluoride (NiF₂) catalyst, this reaction can be carried out efficiently with high yields at temperatures as low as **120°C**. Below 100°C, the reaction rate drops significantly.\n\n3.  **Fluorination of Xenon Difluoride:** XeF₄ can also be prepared in a two-step process, first making XeF₂, then fluorinating it.\n    *   Reaction: `XeF₂(s) + F₂(g) → XeF₄(s)`\n    *   Conditions: This second step is also efficient at temperatures lower than the direct synthesis from elements, typically in the range of **120°C to 300°C**.\n\n4.  **Photochemical Synthesis:** XeF₄ can be formed by irradiating a mixture of xenon and fluorine with UV light or even strong sunlight.\n    *   Conditions: This method can work at or below room temperature, with some syntheses reported at **-78°C**. However, these reactions are generally considered inefficient for producing significant quantities, often being very slow (taking days or weeks for partial conversion) or requiring specialized, high-intensity equipment. Therefore, they often do not meet the standard for an \"efficient\" process compared to thermal methods.\n\n5.  **Synthesis with Unstable Reagents:** XeF₄ can be made by reacting xenon with extremely reactive fluorinating agents like dioxygen difluoride (O₂F₂).\n    *   Conditions: This works at very low temperatures (e.g., -118°C), but O₂F₂ is dangerously unstable and explosive, making this method impractical and not \"efficient\" from a safety and handling perspective.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Options in Light of \"Efficient\" Synthesis**\nWe need to find the coldest temperature in the list where an efficient method works. Based on the analysis above, practical and efficient synthesis is best represented by the thermal methods.\n\n*   **A. 600°C:** This temperature is too high. It favors the over-fluorination of xenon to form xenon hexafluoride (XeF₆), not XeF₄.\n*   **B. 400°C:** This is the standard temperature for the efficient uncatalyzed thermal synthesis. However, the existence of catalyzed methods proves that it's possible to be efficient at colder temperatures. Thus, this is not the *coldest* possible option.\n*   **C. 200°C:** We know that efficient catalytic synthesis works well at 120°C. A reaction efficient at 120°C will also be efficient (and likely faster) at 200°C. This temperature is a valid point for efficient production.\n*   **D. 78°C:** This temperature is below the 120°C threshold for the efficient catalytic thermal method. At 100°C, the catalytic reaction is already known to be much slower, so it would be inefficient at 78°C.\n*   **E. 0°C & F. -78°C:** These temperatures are only accessible through photochemical or other specialized routes, which are generally not considered \"efficient\" for practical, bulk synthesis due to low rates.\n\n**Step 4: Conclusion**\nThe question asks for the coldest temperature where production is *still* efficient. While the \"standard\" temperature is 400°C, more advanced catalytic methods allow for efficient synthesis at 120°C. Comparing this to the available options, 78°C is too low for an efficient thermal process. 200°C is the lowest temperature on the list that is comfortably within the range of known efficient thermal synthesis (specifically, the catalytic method or the fluorination of XeF₂). Therefore, 200°C is the best answer.\n\n<<<C>>>"
