    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the question**\nThe question asks to identify a specific character from a particular piece of media. The key components are:\n*   **Media:** The online cartoon series \"Homestar Runner\".\n*   **Episode:** \"Teen Girl Squad #15\".\n*   **Event:** The Junior prom.\n*   **Object:** A cardboard cutout.\n*   **Identity:** A fictional singer.\n\n**Step 2: List all the careful points**\n*   **Verify the Episode Content:** The primary task is to confirm what happens in \"Teen Girl Squad #15\". The episode is also known by its title, \"4 Gregs\".\n*   **Locate the Prom Scene:** I need to find the part of the episode that takes place at the prom. In the Teen Girl Squad's slang, this is the \"Priggidy Prizom\".\n*   **Identify the Musical Performer:** I need to look at the stage during the prom scene to see who is performing.\n*   **Confirm the \"Cardboard Cutout\" Detail:** The question specifies it's a cardboard cutout. This is a crucial detail that distinguishes it from a live performance.\n*   **Confirm the \"Fictional Singer\" Detail:** The singer must be a character created for the Homestar Runner universe, not a real-world musician.\n*   **Get the Correct Name:** The spelling and name must be accurate as per the source material.\n\n**Step 3: Acquire the final answer with step-by-step analysis**\n1.  First, I'll access information about \"Homestar Runner\" and specifically the \"Teen Girl Squad\" sub-series.\n2.  I will then focus on episode #15, \"4 Gregs\". In this episode, the four main characters get dates for their Junior Prom.\n3.  The final scene of the cartoon takes place at the prom. An announcer's voice is heard over the loudspeaker.\n4.  The announcer says, \"And now, give a big hand for... a cardboard cutout of Kassiopia!\"\n5.  On the stage, there is indeed a cardboard cutout of a female singer with a microphone stand, positioned in front of a drum set that also says \"Kassiopia\".\n6.  Kassiopia is a fictional band/singer within the Homestar Runner universe, fulfilling that part of the query.\n7.  Therefore, the cardboard cutout performing at the Junior Prom is of the fictional singer Kassiopia.\n\n<<<Kassiopia>>>"
