    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the cardinality of the set of continuous functions $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ that satisfy the equation $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$.\n\n**Step 1: Initial analysis of the function `f`**\n\nLet $f$ be a continuous function from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$ satisfying $f(f(x)) = e^x$.\n\n1.  **Injectivity:** We first check if $f$ is one-to-one (injective).\n    Suppose $f(x_1) = f(x_2)$ for some $x_1, x_2 \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n    Applying $f$ to both sides, we get $f(f(x_1)) = f(f(x_2))$.\n    Using the given equation, this becomes $e^{x_1} = e^{x_2}$.\n    Since the exponential function $g(x)=e^x$ is injective, we must have $x_1 = x_2$.\n    Therefore, $f$ must be an injective function.\n\n2.  **Monotonicity:** A continuous and injective function defined on $\\mathbb{R}$ must be strictly monotonic (either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing). We analyze these two cases separately.\n\n**Step 2: Case 1 - `f` is strictly decreasing**\n\nLet's assume $f$ is a strictly decreasing continuous function.\n\n1.  If $f$ is strictly decreasing, then the composition $f \\circ f$ is strictly increasing. This is consistent with $f(f(x)) = e^x$, as $e^x$ is a strictly increasing function.\n\n2.  Let $R_f$ denote the range of $f$. Since $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is continuous and strictly decreasing, its range $R_f$ is an open interval $(L, M)$, where $L = \\lim_{x\\to\\infty} f(x)$ and $M = \\lim_{x\\to-\\infty} f(x)$, with $M > L$. $L$ and $M$ can be finite or infinite.\n\n3.  The range of $f(f(x))$ is given as the range of $e^x$, which is $(0, \\infty)$. The range of $f(f(x))$ is also the image of the range of $f$ under $f$, i.e., $f(R_f) = f((L,M))$.\n    So, $f((L,M)) = (0, \\infty)$.\n\n4.  Since $f$ is strictly decreasing, applying it to the interval $(L,M)$ reverses the endpoints:\n    $f((L,M)) = \\left(\\lim_{y\\to M^-} f(y), \\lim_{y\\to L^+} f(y)\\right)$.\n    Comparing this with $(0, \\infty)$, we must have:\n    $\\lim_{y\\to M^-} f(y) = 0$\n    $\\lim_{y\\to L^+} f(y) = \\infty$\n\n5.  The condition $\\lim_{y\\to L^+} f(y) = \\infty$ implies that $f$ has a vertical asymptote as its input approaches $L$ from the right. For a function to be continuous on all of $\\mathbb{R}$, it cannot have a vertical asymptote at any finite point. Therefore, $L$ cannot be a finite real number, which means we must have $L = -\\infty$.\n\n6.  With $L = -\\infty$, the condition becomes $\\lim_{y\\to-\\infty} f(y) = \\infty$. This describes the behavior of $f$ itself as its input goes to $-\\infty$. This limit must be equal to $M$. So, $M=\\infty$.\n\n7.  This implies that the range of $f$ is $R_f = (L,M) = (-\\infty, \\infty) = \\mathbb{R}$.\n\n8.  Now we have a contradiction. The equation $f(f(x))=e^x > 0$ implies that for any value $y$ in the range of $f$, $f(y)$ must be positive. Since we found that the range of $f$ is $\\mathbb{R}$, this would mean $f(y)>0$ for all $y \\in \\mathbb{R}$. But if $f(y)>0$ for all $y$, its range must be a subset of $(0, \\infty)$, which contradicts the finding that the range is $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\nTherefore, no strictly decreasing continuous solution exists.\n\n**Step 3: Case 2 - `f` is strictly increasing**\n\nLet's assume $f$ is a strictly increasing continuous function.\n\n1.  If $f$ is strictly increasing, then $f \\circ f$ is also strictly increasing, which is consistent with $f(f(x)) = e^x$.\n\n2.  A strictly increasing function $f$ cannot have any fixed points. If $f(x_0) = x_0$, then $f(f(x_0)) = f(x_0) = x_0$, which would mean $e^{x_0} = x_0$. This equation has no real solutions.\n\n3.  Since $f$ is continuous and has no fixed points, either $f(x)>x$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$ or $f(x)<x$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. If we assume $f(x)<x$ for all $x$, then because $f$ is increasing, $f(f(x)) < f(x) < x$. This would imply $e^x < x$, which is false for all real $x$. Therefore, we must have $f(x)>x$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\n4.  Such increasing solutions exist. To determine their number, we can analyze the degrees of freedom in constructing such a function. A standard method is to define the function on a specific interval and then extend it to all of $\\mathbb{R}$ using the properties of the equation.\n\n5.  A property that can be derived from the main equation is that $f$ commutes with $e^x$, i.e., $f(e^x) = e^{f(x)}$.\n    Proof: $f(e^x) = f(f(f(x)))$ and $e^{f(x)} = f(f(f(x)))$. Since $f$ is injective, these imply $f(e^x)=e^{f(x)}$. This relation allows the extension of $f$ from an interval like $[a, e^a)$ to all of $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\n6.  Let's define $f$ on an interval starting at $0$. Let $c=f(0)$.\n    From $f(x)>x$, we have $c = f(0) > 0$.\n    From the original equation, $f(f(0))=e^0 \\implies f(c)=1$.\n    Since $f$ is strictly increasing and $c>0$, we have $f(c)>f(0)$, which means $1>c$.\n    So, any solution must satisfy $0 < c < 1$ for $c=f(0)$.\n\n7.  The construction proceeds as follows:\n    a.  **Choose `c`:** Pick any real number $c$ in the interval $(0,1)$. This choice will define $f(0)=c$.\n    b.  **Define `f` on `[0, c]`:** On the interval $[0, c]$, $f$ must be a continuous, strictly increasing function that maps $[0, c]$ to $[f(0), f(c)] = [c, 1]$. Let's call this function segment $h_1$. So $h_1: [0,c] \\to [c,1]$ is a homeomorphism with $h_1(0)=c$ and $h_1(c)=1$.\n    c.  **Determine `f` on `(c, 1]`:** For any $x \\in (c, 1]$, $x$ is in the range of $h_1$. So there is a unique $y \\in (0,c)$ such that $x=h_1(y)$, which means $y=h_1^{-1}(x)$. Then we must define $f(x)$ as:\n    $f(x) = f(h_1(y)) = f(f(y)) = e^y = e^{h_1^{-1}(x)}$.\n    d.  **Extend `f` to all of `R`:** The definition of $f$ on $[0,1]$ is now fixed. Using the relation $f(e^x) = e^{f(x)}$, the function can be uniquely extended to all of $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\n8.  **Counting the solutions:** The set of solutions is determined by the possible choices in the construction.\n    *   **Choice of `c`:** The value $c=f(0)$ can be any number in the interval $(0,1)$. The set $(0,1)$ has a cardinality of the continuum, $\\mathfrak{c} = |\\mathbb{R}|$.\n    *   **Choice of `h_1`:** For any fixed $c \\in (0,1)$, we need to choose a homeomorphism $h_1$ from $[0, c]$ to $[c, 1]$. The set of such homeomorphisms also has cardinality $\\mathfrak{c}$. To see this, one can map $[0,c]$ and $[c,1]$ to $[0,1]$ and count the homeomorphisms of $[0,1]$ onto itself, which is a set of cardinality $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n    *   Different choices of $c$ or $h_1$ lead to different functions. If $c_1 \\neq c_2$, the functions are different because their values at $x=0$ differ. If $c$ is the same but $h_{1a} \\neq h_{1b}$, the functions will differ on the interval $[0,c]$.\n\n**Step 4: Final Cardinality**\n\nThe total number of solutions is the product of the number of choices at each step.\nTotal Cardinality = (Number of choices for $c$) $\\times$ (Number of choices for $h_1$ for each $c$).\nTotal Cardinality = $\\mathfrak{c} \\times \\mathfrak{c} = \\mathfrak{c}$.\n\nThe cardinality of the set of these functions is the cardinality of the continuum."
