    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the continued fraction associated with the generalized Markov number \\( m_{4/7} \\).\n\n### Step 1: Understand the definition of the objects involved.\n\nThe question asks for a continued fraction associated with a generalized Markov number \\(m_{p/q}\\). This suggests that the primary object of interest is a continued fraction, from which the number \\(m_{p/q}\\) is derived. The term \"associated with\" implies a constructive relationship.\n\nIn the theory of Markov numbers and their generalizations, particularly in the context of Diophantine approximation and related fields, a rational number \\(p/q\\) is linked to a specific quadratic irrational number. The properties of this irrational number (like its Markov constant) are then studied.\n\nThe construction proceeds as follows:\n1.  First, we find the simple continued fraction of the rational number \\(p/q\\).\n2.  Using the coefficients of this continued fraction, we construct a new, purely periodic continued fraction with a palindromic period. This new continued fraction represents a quadratic irrational number, let's call it \\(\\alpha_{p/q}\\).\n3.  The generalized Markov number \\(m_{p/q}\\) is then a value derived from this quadratic irrational \\(\\alpha_{p/q}\\).\n\nThe most natural interpretation of the question is that it asks for the continued fraction of \\(\\alpha_{p/q}\\) itself.\n\n### Step 2: Compute the continued fraction of the rational number 4/7.\n\nWe use the Euclidean algorithm to find the continued fraction expansion of \\(4/7\\).\nSince \\(0 < 4/7 < 1\\), the integer part is 0.\n$$ \\frac{4}{7} = \\frac{1}{7/4} $$\nNow we expand \\(7/4\\):\n$$ \\frac{7}{4} = 1 + \\frac{3}{4} $$\nNow we expand \\(4/3\\):\n$$ \\frac{4}{3} = 1 + \\frac{1}{3} $$\nThe last term is 3, which is an integer. The algorithm terminates.\nSubstituting back, we get:\n$$ \\frac{4}{7} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{3}{4}} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{1}{4/3}} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{1}{3}}} $$\nSo, the continued fraction for \\(4/7\\) is \\([0; 1, 1, 3]\\). Let's denote the coefficients as \\(a_1=1, a_2=1, a_3=3\\).\n\n### Step 3: Construct the associated periodic continued fraction.\n\nThe quadratic irrational number \\(\\alpha_{p/q}\\) associated with \\(p/q = [0; a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n]\\) is defined by a purely periodic continued fraction whose repeating block is the palindrome formed by the sequence of coefficients and its reverse.\nThe period is \\((a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n, a_n, \\dots, a_2, a_1)\\).\n\nFor \\(p/q = 4/7\\), we have the coefficients \\((a_1, a_2, a_3) = (1, 1, 3)\\).\nThe reversed sequence is \\((a_3, a_2, a_1) = (3, 1, 1)\\).\nThe palindromic period is \\((1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1)\\).\n\nThe continued fraction associated with \\(m_{4/7}\\) is therefore:\n$$ \\alpha_{4/7} = [0; \\overline{1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1}] $$\n\n### Careful Points:\n*   **Definition of Generalized Markov Number:** The term \"generalized Markov number\" is used for several distinct, though related, concepts in different mathematical fields (like cluster algebras, number theory, Lie algebra). The ambiguity of the term requires choosing the most plausible definition based on the context. The construction via palindromic continued fractions is fundamental in the study of the Markov spectrum.\n*   **Interpretation of \"Associated with\":** The phrase \"continued fraction associated with \\(m_{4/7}\\)\" could mean \"the continued fraction of the number \\(m_{4/7}\\)\" or \"the continued fraction used to define \\(m_{4/7}\\)\". The latter interpretation is more likely, as it refers to a more fundamental object in the theory from which the scalar \\(m_{4/7}\\) is derived. For example, one definition of the number \\(m_{p/q}\\) is \\(1/\\alpha_{p/q} + 1/\\alpha'_{p/q}\\) (where \\(\\alpha'_{p/q}\\) is the algebraic conjugate of \\(\\alpha_{p/q}\\)), which clearly shows that \\(\\alpha_{p/q}\\) is the primary object.\n*   **Calculation Accuracy:** The steps of the Euclidean algorithm for finding the continued fraction of \\(4/7\\) must be correct. A mistake here would alter the entire resulting palindromic period.\n    *   \\(7=1\\cdot4+3\\)\n    *   \\(4=1\\cdot3+1\\)\n    *   \\(3=3\\cdot1+0\\)\n    The quotients are indeed 1, 1, 3. So \\([0; 1, 1, 3]\\) is correct.\n\n### Final Answer Formulation\nThe question asks to compute the continued fraction. The result is the expression for this continued fraction.\n\nFinal computation:\n1.  Find the continued fraction of \\(4/7\\): \\(4/7 = [0; 1, 1, 3]\\).\n2.  The coefficients are \\((a_1, a_2, a_3) = (1, 1, 3)\\).\n3.  The associated periodic continued fraction has a period \\((a_1, a_2, a_3, a_3, a_2, a_1) = (1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1)\\).\n4.  The final result is \\([0; \\overline{1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1}]\\).\n\n<<<[0; \\(\\overline{1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1}\\)]>>>"
