No. Spontaneous parametric downconversion (SPDC) is a second-order nonlinear optical process that requires the medium to have a non-zero second-order nonlinear susceptibility ($\chi^{(2)}$). A material only possesses a non-zero $\chi^{(2)}$ if its crystal structure lacks inversion symmetry (i.e., is non-centrosymmetric). The most stable and commonly synthesized phases of boron nanosheets (borophene), such as the $\beta_{12}$ and $\chi_{3}$ phases, have crystal structures that are centrosymmetric. Due to this inversion symmetry, their intrinsic bulk $\chi^{(2)}$ is zero, which forbids the SPDC process. While effects like strain or surface defects could break this symmetry and induce a very weak response, an ideal free-standing boron nanosheet is not expected to exhibit this phenomenon.
