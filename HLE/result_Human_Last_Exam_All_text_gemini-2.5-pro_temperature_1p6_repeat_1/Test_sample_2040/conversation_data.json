    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Phenomenon - Spontaneous Parametric Downconversion (SPDC)**\nSpontaneous Parametric Downconversion (SPDC) is a quantum optical process that is foundational to many quantum technologies, including sources of entangled photons. It involves a nonlinear optical crystal. When a high-energy photon (called the \"pump\" photon) passes through this crystal, it has a small probability of spontaneously splitting into two lower-energy photons (called the \"signal\" and \"idler\" photons).\n\nFor this process to occur, two fundamental conditions must be met:\n1.  **Energy Conservation:** The energy of the pump photon must equal the sum of the energies of the signal and idler photons. ($\\omega_{pump} = \\omega_{signal} + \\omega_{idler}$).\n2.  **Momentum Conservation (Phase Matching):** The momentum of the pump photon must equal the vector sum of the momenta of the signal and idler photons. ($\\vec{k}_{pump} = \\vec{k}_{signal} + \\vec{k}_{idler}$).\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Key Material Property for SPDC**\nThe interaction between the light and the material that enables SPDC is a **second-order nonlinear optical effect**. The strength of this effect is quantified by the material's **second-order nonlinear susceptibility tensor, denoted as $\\chi^{(2)}$ (chi-two)**. A material must have a non-zero $\\chi^{(2)}$ to support SPDC efficiently.\n\n**Step 3: Relate Material Symmetry to the Key Property ($\\chi^{(2)}$)**\nThere is a fundamental relationship between a material's crystal structure and its optical properties. Specifically, for the second-order susceptibility $\\chi^{(2)}$ to be non-zero (within the dominant electric-dipole approximation), the material's crystal lattice **must lack a center of inversion symmetry**. Such materials are called **non-centrosymmetric**.\n\nIn a material with inversion symmetry (centrosymmetric), applying an electric field $\\vec{E}$ and its inverse $-\\vec{E}$ must produce polarizations that are also inverses of each other ($\\vec{P}(\\vec{E}) = -\\vec{P}(-\\vec{E})$). The second-order polarization is proportional to the square of the electric field ($P^{(2)} \\propto \\chi^{(2)} E^2$). If we reverse the field, $P^{(2)} \\propto \\chi^{(2)} (-E)^2 = \\chi^{(2)} E^2$. However, due to symmetry, the polarization must also reverse, leading to the contradiction that $P^{(2)}$ must be equal to $-P^{(2)}$. This is only possible if $P^{(2)}=0$, which implies that for centrosymmetric materials, $\\chi^{(2)}$ must be zero.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Crystal Structure of Boron Nanosheets (Borophene)**\nNow we must examine the crystal structure of boron nanosheets, also known as borophene.\n*   **Polymorphism:** Unlike graphene, which has a single stable form, borophene is polymorphic, meaning it can exist in many different atomic arrangements (phases).\n*   **Common Phases:** The most commonly synthesized phases of borophene (typically grown on a silver substrate) are the $\\beta_{12}$ and $\\chi_{3}$ phases. Theoretical calculations have also predicted many other stable and metastable free-standing structures.\n*   **Symmetry of Common Phases:**\n    *   The **$\\beta_{12}$ phase** belongs to the space group *Pmmn*. This space group contains an inversion center, making it **centrosymmetric**.\n    *   The **$\\chi_{3}$ phase** belongs to the space group *Cmcm*. This space group also contains an inversion center, making it **centrosymmetric**.\n    *   Most other low-energy predicted structures for free-standing borophene are also centrosymmetric.\n\n**Step 5: Synthesize the Analysis and Form a Conclusion**\n1.  SPDC requires a material with a non-zero second-order nonlinear susceptibility, $\\chi^{(2)}$.\n2.  A non-zero $\\chi^{(2)}$ requires a non-centrosymmetric crystal structure.\n3.  The common and most stable forms of boron nanosheets are centrosymmetric.\n4.  Because they are centrosymmetric, their intrinsic bulk $\\chi^{(2)}$ is zero.\n5.  Therefore, free-standing boron nanosheets are not expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric downconversion.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Surface Effects:** In any finite material, inversion symmetry is broken at the surface. For a 2D material like a nanosheet, this surface effect could theoretically produce a very small $\\chi^{(2)}$. However, for a symmetric free-standing sheet, the contribution from the top surface would be cancelled by the contribution from the bottom surface.\n*   **Higher-Order Contributions:** The rule that $\\chi^{(2)}$ is zero in centrosymmetric materials applies under the electric-dipole approximation. Very weak second-order effects can arise from electric quadrupole and magnetic dipole interactions, but these are typically many orders of magnitude weaker than dipole-allowed effects and would not lead to an efficient SPDC process.\n*   **Strain and Defects:** Applying mechanical strain or introducing defects into the nanosheet could potentially break the inversion symmetry and induce a localized or global $\\chi^{(2)}$. However, this is an engineered property, not an intrinsic property of the pristine, ideal material.\n\nBased on the intrinsic properties of the material, the expectation is that they would not be a suitable medium for SPDC.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n<<<No. Spontaneous parametric downconversion (SPDC) is a second-order nonlinear optical process that requires the medium to have a non-zero second-order nonlinear susceptibility ($\\chi^{(2)}$). A material only possesses a non-zero $\\chi^{(2)}$ if its crystal structure lacks inversion symmetry (i.e., is non-centrosymmetric). The most stable and commonly synthesized phases of boron nanosheets (borophene), such as the $\\beta_{12}$ and $\\chi_{3}$ phases, have crystal structures that are centrosymmetric. Due to this inversion symmetry, their intrinsic bulk $\\chi^{(2)}$ is zero, which forbids the SPDC process. While effects like strain or surface defects could break this symmetry and induce a very weak response, an ideal free-standing boron nanosheet is not expected to exhibit this phenomenon.>>>"
