    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the IUPAC name of the compound.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Molecular Formula**\nThe molecular formula is $C_7H_{14}$.\nWe first calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE) or Double Bond Equivalent.\nDBE = C + 1 - (H/2)\nDBE = 7 + 1 - (14/2) = 8 - 7 = 1.\nA DBE of 1 indicates the presence of either one double bond or one ring in the molecule.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the $^{13}$C NMR Spectrum**\nThe spectrum provides the chemical shift and the multiplicity (from DEPT or off-resonance decoupling) for each unique carbon environment. The multiplicity tells us the number of hydrogen atoms attached to each carbon:\n*   (s) = singlet = quaternary carbon (C, 0 H)\n*   (d) = doublet = methine carbon (CH, 1 H)\n*   (t) = triplet = methylene carbon (CH₂, 2 H)\n*   (q) = quartet = methyl carbon (CH₃, 3 H)\n\nThe given signals are:\n*   **145 ppm (s):** The chemical shift is in the alkene region (100-150 ppm). The singlet multiplicity indicates a quaternary carbon (no attached protons). This corresponds to a >**C**= fragment.\n*   **112 ppm (t):** This chemical shift is also in the alkene region. The triplet multiplicity indicates a CH₂ group. This corresponds to a =**C**H₂ fragment.\n    *   Combining these two alkene signals gives us a terminal, disubstituted double bond: >C=CH₂. This accounts for the DBE of 1.\n*   **48 ppm (t):** This signal is in the aliphatic region. The triplet multiplicity indicates a CH₂ group. This corresponds to a -**C**H₂- fragment.\n*   **27 ppm (d):** This signal is in the aliphatic region. The doublet multiplicity indicates a CH group. This corresponds to a -**C**H- fragment.\n*   **22 ppm (q):** This signal is in the aliphatic region. The quartet multiplicity indicates a CH₃ group. This corresponds to a -**C**H₃ fragment.\n*   **21 ppm (q):** This is another signal for a CH₃ group in the aliphatic region. This corresponds to a second, non-equivalent -**C**H₃ fragment.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Complete Set of Carbon Fragments**\nThe molecular formula is $C_7H_{14}$, meaning there are 7 carbon atoms. The $^{13}$C NMR spectrum shows only 6 signals. This indicates that two carbon atoms are chemically equivalent, resulting in an overlapping signal.\n\nLet's sum the fragments from the 6 signals:\n*   Fragments: >C, =CH₂, -CH₂-, -CH-, and two -CH₃.\n*   Total Carbons: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 6 carbons.\n*   Total Hydrogens: 0 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 3 = 11 hydrogens.\n\nThe formula is $C_7H_{14}$. We are missing one carbon and three hydrogens (14 - 11 = 3), which corresponds to one more CH₃ group. Therefore, one of the quartet signals (at 22 ppm or 21 ppm) must represent two chemically equivalent methyl groups.\n\nOur complete set of fragments for the $C_7H_{14}$ molecule is:\n*   One >C=CH₂ unit\n*   One -CH₂- group\n*   One -CH- group\n*   Three -CH₃ groups\n\n**Step 4: Assemble the Fragments into a Structure**\nThe core of the molecule is the >C=CH₂ unit. The quaternary carbon must be connected to two alkyl groups, which are to be built from the remaining fragments: one -CH₂-, one -CH-, and three -CH₃.\n\nLet's assemble these 5 aliphatic carbons and 11 hydrogens into two alkyl groups:\n*   A **-CH-** group combined with **two -CH₃** groups forms an **isopropyl group**, -CH(CH₃)₂.\n*   A **-CH₂-** group combined with one **-CH₃** group forms an **ethyl group**, -CH₂CH₃.\n\nThis combination uses all the available aliphatic fragments. Now, we attach these two groups to the quaternary carbon of the >C=CH₂ unit.\n\nThe resulting structure is:\n```\n      CH(CH₃)₂  (Isopropyl group)\n     /\n   C = CH₂\n  /\n CH₂CH₃   (Ethyl group)\n```\n\n**Step 5: Determine the IUPAC Name**\nTo find the IUPAC name, we identify the longest continuous carbon chain that includes the double bond.\n\n```\n       CH₃(5)\n       |\n¹CH₂ = ²C -- ³CH -- ⁴CH₃\n       |\n       CH₂(6)\n       |\n       CH₃(7)\n```\nLet's trace the longest chain containing C1 and C2:\nPath A: C1-C2-C3-C4 is a 4-carbon chain (a butene).\nPath B: C1-C2-C6-C7 is also a 4-carbon chain (a butene).\n\nAccording to IUPAC rules, if there's a choice between two chains of equal length, we choose the one with the greater number of substituents.\n*   Using Path A (¹CH₂ = ²C -- ³CH -- ⁴CH₃) as the main chain: We have one substituent, an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃), at position 2. This name would be incorrect as the substituent contains another substituent (the methyl group is on the ethyl).\n*   Let's re-examine the correct way to name it: The main chain is a but-1-ene. We number from the end that gives the double bond the lowest number. So, ¹CH₂ = ²C...\nThe substituents on this 4-carbon chain are an ethyl group at C2 and a methyl group at C3.\nChain: ¹CH₂ = ²C(-CH₂CH₃) - ³CH(-CH₃) - ⁴CH₃\nSubstituents:\n*   At C2: an ethyl group\n*   At C3: a methyl group\n\nAlphabetize the substituents (ethyl before methyl).\nThe final IUPAC name is **2-ethyl-3-methylbut-1-ene**.\n\nThis structure is consistent with the NMR data. For example, the CH₂ group at 48 ppm (signal t) is the allylic methylene of the ethyl group, whose chemical shift is higher than a typical saturated CH₂ due to its proximity to the double bond and the sterically crowded quaternary carbon. The signal at 27 ppm (d) corresponds to the CH group of the isopropyl substituent. The three methyl groups give rise to the two quartet signals at 22 and 21 ppm, with two of them being accidentally equivalent.\n\n<<<2-ethyl-3-methylbut-1-ene>>>"
