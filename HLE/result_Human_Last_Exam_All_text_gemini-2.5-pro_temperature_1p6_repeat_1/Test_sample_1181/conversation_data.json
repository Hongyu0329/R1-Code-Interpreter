    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Question:** The question asks to pinpoint the character from Andrei Tarkovsky's 1972 film *Solaris* who specifically expresses shame for no longer being able to recall the sound of rustling leaves on Earth. This is a very specific piece of dialogue or sentiment.\n\n2.  **Character Breakdown and Evaluation:**\n    *   **Kris Kelvin (A):** The protagonist. The film opens with him at his father's dacha on Earth, surrounded by the sounds of nature, including rustling leaves. This sound is a strong motif associated with him and his connection to Earth. However, his primary emotional conflict throughout the film is his guilt over his deceased wife, Hari, and his relationship with her replica. He doesn't voice this specific shame about the leaves.\n    *   **Hari (B):** A \"visitor\" or \"guest\" created by the planet Solaris from Kris's memories. As a simulacrum who has never actually lived on Earth, she would have no memory of rustling leaves to miss. Her emotional journey is about understanding her own existence and her love for Kris.\n    *   **Dr. Snaut (C):** One of the surviving scientists on the space station. He is weary, cynical, and philosophical. Having been isolated in space for a long time, he often reflects on the psychological and existential condition of the crew. It is highly plausible that a character this introspective would feel a profound sense of detachment from Earth.\n    *   **Dr. Sartorius (D):** The other surviving scientist. He is depicted as cold, clinical, and obsessed with the scientific aspects of their mission. He actively suppresses emotion and sentimentality, viewing them as weaknesses. It would be out of character for him to admit to such a nostalgic or shameful feeling.\n    *   **Dr. Gibarian (E):** The scientist who committed suicide before Kris's arrival. He appears only in a recorded video message. In his message, he expresses despair and warns Kris, but he does not mention missing the sound of leaves.\n\n3.  **Locating the Specific Dialogue:** The key moment occurs during a lengthy conversation between Kris and Snaut. Snaut delivers a monologue about the folly of their mission and the nature of humanity. He muses that humanity seeks a mirror, not other worlds. In this context of lost connection and purpose, he confesses his shame. He admits that he has been in space so long that he has forgotten fundamental earthly sensations. The dialogue, depending on the translation, is to the effect of: \"I've even forgotten what the rustling of leaves sounds like.\" He explicitly links this forgetting to a sense of shame.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** The character who articulates this feeling of shame for losing his connection to Earth, symbolized by the forgotten sound of rustling leaves, is Dr. Snaut.\n\n<<<C>>>"
