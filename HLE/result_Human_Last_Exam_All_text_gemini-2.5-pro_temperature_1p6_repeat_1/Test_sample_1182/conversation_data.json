    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of double points in the stable reduction of the curve $C: y^2 = 8x^5 + 4x^4 + 4x^3 + x^2 + 8x$ over the 2-adic numbers $\\mathbb{Q}_2$.\n\n**Step 1: Simplify the equation of the curve.**\nThe curve is given by the equation $y^2 = 8x^5 + 4x^4 + 4x^3 + x^2 + 8x$.\nThis is a hyperelliptic curve of genus $g=2$, since the degree of the polynomial on the right-hand side is 5, and $g = \\lfloor(5-1)/2\\rfloor = 2$.\nThe coefficients are integers, so we can consider this as a model over the ring of 2-adic integers $\\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n\nWe can rewrite the equation by isolating the terms divisible by higher powers of 2.\n$y^2 - x^2 = 8x^5 + 4x^4 + 4x^3 + 8x$\n$y^2 - x^2 = 4(2x^5 + x^4 + x^3 + 2x)$\nThe right side is divisible by 4. This implies that $y^2 \\equiv x^2 \\pmod 4$. For any point $(x,y)$ on the curve with coordinates in $\\mathbb{Z}_2$, this means $y \\equiv x \\pmod 2$ or $y \\equiv -x \\pmod 2$.\n\nThis form suggests a change of variables. Let $y = Y+x$. Substituting this into the equation would not be convenient.\nLet's consider the transformation which \"removes the square part\". Let $h(x)=x$ and $g(x)=2x^5+x^4+x^3+2x$. The equation is $y^2 = h(x)^2 + 4g(x)$.\nThis suggests a transformation that leads to a simpler model for analyzing the reduction. Let's define a new variable $y_1$. Since $y^2-x^2$ is divisible by 4, $y-x$ or $y+x$ must be divisible by 2. Let's make the transformation $y_1 = (y-x)/2$. This is not guaranteed to be in $\\mathbb{Z}_2[x,y]$ without a field extension, but let's see. The transformation yields:\n$y=2y_1+x \\implies (2y_1+x)^2 = x^2+4g(x)$\n$4y_1^2 + 4xy_1 + x^2 = x^2 + 4g(x)$\nDividing by 4, we get:\n$y_1^2 + xy_1 = g(x)$\n$y_1^2 + xy_1 = 2x^5 + x^4 + x^3 + 2x$\nThis new model, let's call it $C'$, is birationally equivalent to the original curve $C$ over $\\mathbb{Q}_2$. Thus, they have the same stable reduction.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the special fiber of the new model.**\nWe now analyze the reduction of the curve $C'$ modulo 2. Let the coordinates in the special fiber be denoted by lowercase letters.\nThe equation of the special fiber $\\tilde{C'}$ over the field $\\mathbb{F}_2$ is:\n$y_1^2 + xy_1 \\equiv x^4 + x^3 \\pmod 2$\nWe can factor this equation:\n$y_1(y_1+x) = x^3(x+1)$\nThis equation is reducible over $\\mathbb{F}_2$. It is a quadratic equation in $y_1$. We can solve for $y_1$ using the quadratic formula adapted for characteristic 2. The equation is $y_1^2+xy_1+(x^4+x^3)=0$. It is of the form $u^2+Bu+C=0$. This splits if $C/B^2$ can be written as $v^2+v$ for some $v$. Here $B=x, C=x^4+x^3$. $C/B^2 = (x^4+x^3)/x^2=x^2+x$. Let $v=x$. Then $v^2+v=x^2+x$. So it splits. The solutions are $y_1=Bv=x \\cdot x = x^2$ and $y_1=B(v+1)=x(x+1)=x^2+x$.\nSo the special fiber $\\tilde{C'}$ decomposes into two components:\n-   $C_a: y_1 = x^2$\n-   $C_b: y_1 = x^2 + x$\nBoth components are parabolas, which are smooth rational curves (isomorphic to $\\mathbb{P}^1$) over $\\mathbb{F}_2$.\n\n**Step 3: Find the intersection points of the components and their multiplicities.**\nTo find the intersection points, we set the expressions for $y_1$ equal:\n$x^2 = x^2 + x \\implies x = 0$.\nIf $x=0$, then $y_1=0$. So, the components intersect at the affine point $P_1 = (0,0)$.\n\nTo find all intersection points, we must work in the projective plane $\\mathbb{P}^2$. We homogenize the equations of the components. Let the homogeneous coordinates be $[X:Y_1:Z]$.\n$C_a: Y_1 Z = X^2$\n$C_b: Y_1 Z = X^2 + XZ$\nTo find intersections, we equate the expressions for $Y_1Z$:\n$X^2 = X^2 + XZ \\implies XZ = 0$.\n-   If $X=0$, then $Y_1Z=0$. This gives either $Y_1=0$ (so point is $[0:0:1]$, which is our affine point $P_1$) or $Z=0$ (so point is $[0:1:0]$).\n-   If $Z=0$, then $X^2=0 \\implies X=0$. This again leads to the point $[0:1:0]$.\nSo, there are two intersection points: $P_1 = [0:0:1]$ (the origin) and $P_2 = [0:1:0]$ (the point at infinity on the $y_1$-axis).\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the intersection multiplicities.**\nThe number of double points in the stable reduction is determined by the nature of these intersection points.\n-   **At $P_1 = (0,0)$:** The tangent to $C_a: y_1=x^2$ is $y_1=0$. The tangent to $C_b: y_1=x^2+x$ is $y_1=x$. Since the tangents are distinct, the intersection is transversal. The intersection multiplicity is $I(P_1) = 1$. A transversal intersection of two smooth components is a node. This contributes 1 double point to the stable reduction.\n\n-   **At $P_2 = [0:1:0]$:** We analyze the intersection in the affine chart where $Y_1 \\ne 0$, so we set $Y_1=1$. The coordinates are $(x,z)$, where $x=X/Y_1, z=Z/Y_1$.\n    The equations become:\n    $C_a: z = x^2$\n    $C_b: z = x^2 + xz \\implies z(1-x) = x^2$\n    The intersection point $P_2$ is $(x,z)=(0,0)$ in this chart.\n    The local ring at $P_2$ is $\\mathcal{O}_{P_2} = \\mathbb{F}_2[x,z]_{(x,z)}$. The intersection multiplicity is the dimension of the quotient ring:\n    $I(P_2) = \\dim_{\\mathbb{F}_2} \\mathcal{O}_{P_2} / (z-x^2, z(1-x)-x^2)$.\n    Substituting $z=x^2$ into the second generator gives $x^2(1-x)-x^2 = x^2 - x^3 - x^2 = -x^3$.\n    So the ideal is $(z-x^2, -x^3)$. The dimension of the quotient ring is $\\dim_{\\mathbb{F}_2} \\mathbb{F}_2[x]_{(x)}/(x^3)$, which is 3.\n    So, the intersection multiplicity at $P_2$ is $I(P_2) = 3$.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the total number of double points.**\nThe number of double points (nodes) in the stable reduction is obtained by summing the contributions from each intersection point. The contribution of an intersection point of two smooth curves with intersection multiplicity $m$ is $m$.\n-   Contribution from $P_1$: $I(P_1) = 1$ double point.\n-   Contribution from $P_2$: $I(P_2) = 3$ double points.\n\nThe total number of double points in the stable reduction is the sum of these contributions.\nTotal double points = $1 + 3 = 4$.\n\nThe minimal regular model would have a special fiber whose dual graph is a cycle of 4 rational curves. This configuration is stable, and the number of nodes is the number of edges in this cycle, which is 4."
