    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the length of the Second Great War in StarCraft lore.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the \"Second Great War\"**: The term \"Second Great War\" in StarCraft lore refers to the sector-wide conflict depicted across the *StarCraft II* trilogy (*Wings of Liberty*, *Heart of the Swarm*, and *Legacy of the Void*). It is distinct from the First Great War (original *StarCraft*) and the Brood War (*StarCraft: Brood War* expansion).\n\n2.  **Determine the Start Date**: The Second Great War begins at the start of the *Wings of Liberty* campaign. This is canonically established to be in the year **2504**. The war kicks off with the renewed Zerg Swarm invasion of Dominion space, four years after the end of the Brood War.\n\n3.  **Determine the End Date**: The war's primary conflict concludes at the end of the *Legacy of the Void* campaign, specifically with the defeat of the dark god Amon. This climactic event, which involves the reclamation of the Protoss homeworld Aiur and the final battle within the Void, takes place in the year **2506**. While an epilogue campaign takes place later, the main military conflict known as the Second Great War ends in 2506.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Duration**: The war begins in 2504 and ends in 2506.\n    *   The events span across parts of the year 2504.\n    *   The conflict continues through the entirety of the year 2505.\n    *   The war concludes at some point during the year 2506.\n\n    This means the total duration of the war is more than two full years (2504 -> 2505 -> 2506). For example, if it started in March 2504 and ended in May 2506, the duration would be 2 years and 2 months. The exact number of months is not specified in the lore, but it is clear the conflict spans across these three calendar years.\n\n5.  **Apply Rounding**: The question asks for the duration in years, **rounded up**. Since the war lasted for a duration greater than 2 years but less than 3 years, rounding this value up to the next whole number gives a result of 3.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **War Definition**: It is crucial not to confuse the Second Great War (*StarCraft II*) with the Brood War (*StarCraft I expansion*). The Brood War was a much shorter conflict, taking place entirely within the year 2500, which would result in a rounded-up duration of only 1 year. The scope and timeline of the *StarCraft II* conflict firmly establish it as the Second Great War.\n*   **Rounding Rule**: The instruction to \"round up\" is key. A simple subtraction of years (2506 - 2504 = 2) would be inaccurate because it doesn't account for the time spanning across the start and end years. Because the war's duration is definitively greater than 2.0 years, rounding up necessitates an answer of 3.\n\nBased on this analysis, the war lasted for over two years, and when rounded up, the total duration is 3 years.\n\n<<<3>>>"
