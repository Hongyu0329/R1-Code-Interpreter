    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rarest noble gas on Earth.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Question's Core Components**\nThe question asks to identify the noble gas that was the rarest on Earth in the year 2002, measured as a percentage of all terrestrial matter.\n\n*   **Subject:** Noble gases.\n*   **Metric:** Rarest (lowest concentration/abundance).\n*   **Domain:** Earth (terrestrial matter, which primarily means the atmosphere for these gases).\n*   **Timeframe:** 2002.\n\n**Step 2: List the Noble Gases**\nThe noble gases are a group of chemical elements in Group 18 of the periodic table. The naturally occurring noble gases on Earth are:\n*   Helium (He)\n*   Neon (Ne)\n*   Argon (Ar)\n*   Krypton (Kr)\n*   Xenon (Xe)\n*   Radon (Rn)\n\n*(Oganesson is also a noble gas, but it is a synthetic element that does not occur naturally on Earth and is therefore not a candidate.)*\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Timeframe Constraint (2002)**\nFor the stable noble gases (Helium, Neon, Argon, Krypton, Xenon), their concentrations in the atmosphere are effectively constant over human history. Their abundance has not changed in any significant way between 2002 and the present day. Therefore, we can use current abundance data. For Radon, which is radioactive, its overall average concentration is also in a steady state (rate of formation equals rate of decay), so its ranking as the rarest does not change from year to year.\n\n**Step 4: Gather Data on the Abundance of Each Noble Gas**\nThe vast majority of Earth's noble gases are found in the atmosphere. We will analyze their atmospheric concentrations, typically measured in parts per million (ppm) by volume.\n\n*   **Argon (Ar):** The most abundant noble gas, making up about 0.934% of the atmosphere. This is equal to 9,340 ppm.\n*   **Neon (Ne):** The next most abundant, with a concentration of about 18.18 ppm.\n*   **Helium (He):** Its concentration is about 5.24 ppm.\n*   **Krypton (Kr):** Its concentration is about 1.14 ppm.\n*   **Xenon (Xe):** Significantly rarer than the others above, with a concentration of about 0.087 ppm (or 87 parts per billion).\n\n**Step 5: Analyze the Special Case of Radon (Rn)**\nRadon is different from the other noble gases because it is radioactive and has a very short half-life (the most stable isotope, Rn-222, has a half-life of only 3.8 days). It is not a primordial component of the atmosphere but is instead continuously generated by the radioactive decay of uranium and thorium in the Earth's crust. Because it decays so quickly, it never accumulates to significant levels. Its concentration is highly variable by location but its *average* atmospheric concentration is incredibly low, estimated to be around 1 part in 10^21 by volume. This is equivalent to **10^-15 ppm**, which is millions of times smaller than Xenon's concentration (0.087 ppm).\n\n**Step 6: Compare Abundances and Conclude**\nLet's list the noble gases in order from most abundant to least abundant in Earth's atmosphere:\n1.  Argon (Ar): ~9,340 ppm\n2.  Neon (Ne): ~18 ppm\n3.  Helium (He): ~5 ppm\n4.  Krypton (Kr): ~1 ppm\n5.  Xenon (Xe): ~0.087 ppm\n6.  Radon (Rn): ~0.000000000000001 ppm (or 10^-15 ppm)\n\nThe comparison clearly shows that Radon is, by many orders of magnitude, the rarest noble gas on Earth.\n\n<<<Radon>>>"
