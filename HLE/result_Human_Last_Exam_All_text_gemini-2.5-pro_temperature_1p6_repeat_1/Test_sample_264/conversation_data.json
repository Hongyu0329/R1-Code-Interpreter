    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Analysis of the Question and Careful Points\n\n1.  **Coordinate System Setup:** The first step is to represent the cubes in a 3D coordinate system. The easiest way to do this is to place one corner of the first cube at the origin (0, 0, 0).\n    *   **First Cube (Cube A):** If the side length is 1, Cube A can be defined as the set of all points (x, y, z) such that `0 ≤ x ≤ 1`, `0 ≤ y ≤ 1`, and `0 ≤ z ≤ 1`.\n\n2.  **Defining the Main Diagonal:** In this coordinate system, the main diagonal connects the corner at the origin `(0, 0, 0)` to the opposite corner at `(1, 1, 1)`. The vector representing this diagonal is `d = <1, 1, 1>`.\n\n3.  **Careful Point: Interpreting the Shift:** The phrase \"shifted by 1/2 along the main diagonal\" is the most crucial part of the problem and can be interpreted in two ways:\n    *   **Interpretation A (Shift by a distance):** The shift is a displacement of *distance* 1/2 in the *direction* of the main diagonal. The shift vector would be `<1/(2√3), 1/(2√3), 1/(2√3)>`. This leads to a complex, irrational result.\n    *   **Interpretation B (Shift by a vector):** The shift is by a vector that is `1/2` times the main diagonal vector. This is a more common interpretation in such problems as it maintains the simplicity of the numbers involved. The shift vector `v` would be `(1/2) * <1, 1, 1> = <1/2, 1/2, 1/2>`.\n    *   We will proceed with Interpretation B, as it is standard for problems of this type and leads to a clean, rational answer.\n\n4.  **Defining the Second Cube (Cube B):** Cube B is Cube A shifted by the vector `v = <1/2, 1/2, 1/2>`. To find the boundaries of Cube B, we add the shift vector's components to the boundaries of Cube A.\n    *   The boundaries for Cube B are:\n        `0 + 1/2 ≤ x ≤ 1 + 1/2`  =>  `1/2 ≤ x ≤ 3/2`\n        `0 + 1/2 ≤ y ≤ 1 + 1/2`  =>  `1/2 ≤ y ≤ 3/2`\n        `0 + 1/2 ≤ z ≤ 1 + 1/2`  =>  `1/2 ≤ z ≤ 3/2`\n\n5.  **Finding the Intersection:** The volume of the intersection is the volume of the region where a point (x, y, z) belongs to *both* Cube A and Cube B. We must find the overlap for each coordinate's range.\n    *   **For the x-coordinate:** The range must be in `[0, 1]` (from Cube A) AND `[1/2, 3/2]` (from Cube B). The intersection of these intervals is `[1/2, 1]`.\n    *   **For the y-coordinate:** The range must be in `[0, 1]` AND `[1/2, 3/2]`. The intersection is `[1/2, 1]`.\n    *   **For the z-coordinate:** The range must be in `[0, 1]` AND `[1/2, 3/2]`. The intersection is `[1/2, 1]`.\n\n6.  **Calculating the Final Volume:** The intersection is a new rectangular prism (in fact, a cube) defined by `1/2 ≤ x ≤ 1`, `1/2 ≤ y ≤ 1`, `1/2 ≤ z ≤ 1`. We can now find its volume.\n    *   The side length of this intersection cube in each dimension is `1 - 1/2 = 1/2`.\n    *   The volume is the side length cubed: `Volume = (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/8`.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\n*   **Step 1:** Define Cube A as the region `0 ≤ x ≤ 1`, `0 ≤ y ≤ 1`, `0 ≤ z ≤ 1`. Its volume is `1³ = 1`.\n*   **Step 2:** Define the shift vector `v` as `1/2` times the main diagonal vector `<1, 1, 1>`, so `v = <1/2, 1/2, 1/2>`.\n*   **Step 3:** Define Cube B by shifting Cube A by `v`. This gives the region `1/2 ≤ x ≤ 3/2`, `1/2 ≤ y ≤ 3/2`, `1/2 ≤ z ≤ 3/2`.\n*   **Step 4:** Find the intersection of the two cubes by finding the intersection of their coordinate ranges:\n    *   x-range: `[0, 1]` ∩ `[1/2, 3/2]` = `[1/2, 1]`\n    *   y-range: `[0, 1]` ∩ `[1/2, 3/2]` = `[1/2, 1]`\n    *   z-range: `[0, 1]` ∩ `[1/2, 3/2]` = `[1/2, 1]`\n*   **Step 5:** The intersection is a smaller cube with side length `1 - 1/2 = 1/2`.\n*   **Step 6:** Calculate the volume of this intersection cube: `Volume = (1/2)³ = 1/8`.\n\n<<<1/8>>>"
