    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the riddle:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Premise and the Title**\n\n*   The prompt introduces a haiku titled \"The Bays\".\n*   Crucially, it states, \"The title is a question...\". This means we should not take the title literally but interpret it as a question.\n*   \"The Bays\" is a homophone for \"The B's,\" but this path can be misleading. A more fruitful interpretation is that the title sets the theme. \"Bays\" are coastal inlets, which points to a story or setting involving an island and the sea. This strongly suggests William Shakespeare's play, *The Tempest*, which is set on a remote island with bays.\n\n**Step 2: Decode the First Line of the Haiku**\n\n*   **Line 1:** \"An August tempest\"\n*   **Analysis:** This line describes a powerful storm. The play *The Tempest* begins with a violent storm (a tempest) that shipwrecks the King of Naples and his court on Prospero's island. This storm was not natural; it was conjured by the spirit **Ariel** at the command of his master, Prospero.\n*   **Careful Point:** \"August\" likely means grand or majestic, befitting the magical nature of the storm.\n*   **Derived Word 1:** Ariel\n\n**Step 3: Decode the Second Line of the Haiku**\n\n*   **Line 2:** \"Twice fifteen brings winds of change\"\n*   **Analysis:** This line has two parts. \"Winds of change\" refers to a force of rebellion, intrigue, and a desire to alter the status quo. In *The Tempest*, the character who most embodies this rebellious \"wind of change\" is **Caliban**, the island's native inhabitant who despises Prospero's rule and plots against him.\n*   **Careful Point:** \"Twice fifteen\" equals 30. This numerical clue is likely designed to be complex or a misdirection. However, the thematic clue \"winds of change\" points directly to Caliban's role in the play as a source of conflict and attempted upheaval. Within the context of the play, he is the most logical answer for this line.\n*   **Derived Word 2:** Caliban\n\n**Step 4: Decode the Third Line of the Haiku**\n\n*   **Line 3:** \"A divine one yields\"\n*   **Analysis:** This line describes an act of surrender by a god-like figure. Throughout the play, **Prospero** uses his powerful magic to control the fates of everyone on the island, acting as its \"divine\" ruler. In the play's final act, he famously renounces his powers, stating, \"But this rough magic I here abjure... I'll drown my book.\" He \"yields\" his divine power.\n*   **Careful Point:** The word \"yields\" is a perfect description of Prospero's choice to give up his magic and return to the human world.\n*   **Derived Word 3:** Prospero\n\n**Step 5: Assemble the Final Answer**\n\n*   The haiku yields three names of characters from *The Tempest*: Ariel, Caliban, and Prospero.\n*   The prompt asks for the answer to the question (\"The Bays?\") \"in alphabetical order\".\n*   We must arrange the derived words alphabetically.\n    1.  Ariel\n    2.  Caliban\n    3.  Prospero\n*   The sequence is already in alphabetical order. The final answer is the ordered list of these three names.\n\n<<<Ariel, Caliban, Prospero>>>"
