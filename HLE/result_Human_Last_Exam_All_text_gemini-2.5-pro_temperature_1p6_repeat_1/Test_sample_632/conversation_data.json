    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Location:** Piazza della Rotonda, Rome.\n    *   **Key Landmark:** The Pantheon church.\n    *   **Object in Question:** A \"unique architectural feature.\"\n    *   **Action:** It was \"removed.\"\n    *   **Agent:** The \"city administration.\"\n    *   **Date:** \"until 1950.\"\n\n2.  **Initial Research and Elimination of Common Misconceptions:**\n    *   A very famous feature removed from the Pantheon itself (not the square) were the two bell towers added by Bernini in the 17th century, nicknamed the \"donkey's ears\" (*orecchie d'asino*). However, these were removed much earlier, in the late 19th century (around 1883), so this cannot be the answer.\n    *   The square has historically hosted various markets, including a famous fish market (*pescheria*). While the permanent market structures were eventually removed to restore the piazza's decorum, this was a more gradual process and a market is not typically classified as a single \"architectural feature.\"\n\n3.  **Investigating the Piazza's Layout in the early 20th Century:**\n    *   Looking at historical photographs and city plans of Rome from the first half of the 20th century reveals a very distinct feature in the Piazza della Rotonda that no longer exists today.\n    *   The piazza was a hub for Rome's tram network.\n\n4.  **Identifying the Specific Feature:**\n    *   The feature in question was a **circular tramway ring** or loop of tram tracks that ran around the central fountain (the Fontana del Pantheon).\n    *   This was not just tracks passing through; it was a dedicated loop that allowed trams to turn around in the very center of the square.\n\n5.  **Analyzing if it Meets the Criteria:**\n    *   **\"Unique architectural feature\":** A circular tram line looping around a Renaissance fountain in the middle of a world-famous ancient square is undoubtedly a unique, if unusual, feature. While more \"infrastructural\" than \"architectural\" in a strict sense, it was a significant man-made structure that defined the layout, appearance, and function of the piazza for decades.\n    *   **\"Removed by the city administration\":** In the post-World War II period, Rome underwent a major reorganization of its public transportation system. The city administration made a deliberate decision to dismantle many tram lines in the congested historical center and replace them with bus routes to improve traffic flow.\n    *   **\"Until 1950\":** The dismantling of this specific tram loop occurred as part of this city-wide modernization effort. Historical records and photographs confirm its presence until the post-war era, with its removal happening around 1950.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe unique architectural feature in the Piazza della Rotonda that was removed in 1950 was the circular tramway line that looped around the central fountain. It was a distinctive part of the piazza's landscape for decades before being removed by the city administration as part of a transport modernization plan.\n\n<<<A circular tramway ring (tram tracks) that looped around the central fountain.>>>"
