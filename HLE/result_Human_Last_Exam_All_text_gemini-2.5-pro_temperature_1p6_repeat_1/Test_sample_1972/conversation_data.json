    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to arrive at the answer.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Clues\nThe question provides two key pieces of information attributed to Jorge Luis Borges:\n1.  A specific aesthetic judgment about a novel: It possesses \"the intensity of a tiger and the variety that a chess duel can achieve.\"\n2.  A specific literary judgment about the novel's author: He is a \"continuator (and simplifier) of Faulkner.\"\n\nOur task is to find the author and the specific novel that Borges described with these phrases.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Author\nThe second clue is the most direct way to identify the author. Jorge Luis Borges famously admired and wrote about the Uruguayan writer **Juan Carlos Onetti**. It was in a prologue to a collection of Onetti's short stories (*Un sueño realizado y otros cuentos*, 1951) that Borges specifically described him as a \"continuator (and simplifier) of Faulkner.\"\n\n*   **Careful Point:** William Faulkner's influence on the Latin American Boom writers was immense. His complex narratives, stream-of-consciousness techniques, and creation of a mythical county (Yoknapatawpha) were models for many. Borges's description is precise: Onetti continues Faulkner's thematic concerns (alienation, decay, the weight of the past) but does so with a more concise, though equally bleak, style.\n\n### Step 3: Identify the Novel\nThe first clue describes the novel's qualities.\n*   **\"The intensity of a tiger\":** This suggests a raw, visceral, and perhaps savage power. It points to a work of deep psychological tension and primal emotion, even if the surface action is minimal.\n*   **\"The variety that a chess duel can achieve\":** This metaphor is brilliant. A chess game has a finite number of pieces and a strict set of rules, yet it can produce an almost infinite variety of complex, strategic, and intellectually demanding situations. This suggests a novel with a limited cast of characters in a contained setting, where the plot unfolds through intricate psychological maneuvers, strategies, and predetermined moves rather than grand external events.\n\nWhile Borges applied this praise to Onetti's work in general, literary historians and critics most frequently associate this specific quote with what is arguably Onetti's most famous and structurally perfect novel: **_El astillero_** (**_The Shipyard_**), published in 1961.\n\n### Step 4: Verify the Connection\n*   **Does _El astillero_ fit the description?** Absolutely. The novel details the return of the protagonist, Larsen, to a decaying, ghostly shipyard in a hopeless attempt to find purpose.\n    *   The atmosphere is one of intense existential dread and suffocating inertia, fulfilling the \"intensity of a tiger\" criteria through its psychological pressure.\n    *   The plot involves a small number of characters (Larsen, the owner Gruff, the manager Gálvez, the owner's daughter Angélica Inés) trapped in a hermetic world, playing out a grim, ritualistic game of deception and self-deception. Their interactions are strategic, calculated, and ultimately futile, perfectly mirroring a \"chess duel.\"\n*   **Connection to Faulkner:** _El astillero_ is the centerpiece of Onetti's \"Santa María\" saga, a mythical provincial town that is his direct equivalent to Faulkner's Yoknapatawpha County. The themes of decay, fatalism, and the inability to escape the past are deeply Faulknerian.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nBy combining the clue about the author being a \"continuator (and simplifier) of Faulkner\" with the description of the novel's tiger-like intensity and chess-like complexity, we can confidently identify the author as Juan Carlos Onetti and the novel in question as _El astillero_ (_The Shipyard_).\n\n<<<El astillero (The Shipyard)>>>"
