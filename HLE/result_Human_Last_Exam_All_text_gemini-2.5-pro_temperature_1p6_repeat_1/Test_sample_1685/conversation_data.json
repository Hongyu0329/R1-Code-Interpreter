    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the ODE and Initial Conditions.**\n    The given ODE is $y''' = y^{4} + y'^{4} - \\frac{y''}{3 x^{2} + 2} + \\frac{1}{\\tan{\\left(x \\right)} + 1}$.\n    The initial conditions at $x = 0$ are $y(0) = 0.00$, $y'(0) = 3.00$, and $y''(0) = 2.00$.\n\n2.  **Evaluate the initial behavior.**\n    At $x=0$, all initial values $y(0), y'(0), y''(0)$ are non-negative.\n    Let's calculate $y'''(0)$ from the ODE:\n    $y'''(0) = y(0)^{4} + y'(0)^{4} - \\frac{y''(0)}{3(0)^{2} + 2} + \\frac{1}{\\tan(0) + 1}$\n    $y'''(0) = 0^4 + 3^4 - \\frac{2}{2} + \\frac{1}{0+1} = 81 - 1 + 1 = 81$.\n    Since $y'(0)=3>0$, $y''(0)=2>0$, and $y'''(0)=81>0$, the solution $y(x)$ and its derivatives are initially increasing. This suggests a rapid growth of the solution.\n\n3.  **Analyze the behavior for large values.**\n    The problem asks for an approximation in the \"large $x$ regimes\". Due to the strong initial growth, it is likely that $y(x)$ and its derivatives become very large. In this scenario, the terms $y^4$ and $(y')^4$ will likely dominate the right-hand side of the equation.\n    The term $-\\frac{y''}{3x^2+2}$ will become negligible compared to the polynomial terms in $y$ and $y'$ if they grow sufficiently fast.\n    The term $\\frac{1}{\\tan(x)+1}$ is an oscillating term. While it can be large near the poles of $\\tan(x)$, its contribution is often ignored when determining the main asymptotic trend, treating it as a bounded high-frequency perturbation.\n    So, we analyze the simplified, autonomous ODE: $y''' \\approx y^4 + (y')^4$.\n\n4.  **Look for growing solutions.**\n    We test for solutions that grow as $x \\to \\infty$. Power-law solutions of the form $y \\sim A x^p$ for $p>0$ and exponential solutions $y \\sim A e^{\\lambda x}$ do not satisfy the dominant balance of the simplified ODE. This suggests that the solution does not exist for all $x$, but instead develops a singularity at a finite value of $x$, let's call it $x_s$. The \"large x regime\" is then interpreted as $x \\to x_s$.\n\n5.  **Perform a singularity analysis.**\n    Let's assume the solution has a singularity at $x=x_s$. We propose a power-law form for the solution near the singularity: $y(x) \\sim A(x_s-x)^{-\\alpha}$ for $\\alpha>0$.\n    Then $y'(x) \\sim A\\alpha(x_s-x)^{-\\alpha-1}$ and $y'''(x) \\sim A\\alpha(\\alpha+1)(\\alpha+2)(x_s-x)^{-\\alpha-3}$.\n    The RHS is $y^4+(y')^4 \\sim A^4(x_s-x)^{-4\\alpha} + (A\\alpha)^4(x_s-x)^{-4\\alpha-4}$.\n    As $x \\to x_s$, the most singular term (the one with the most negative exponent) on the RHS is $(y')^4$, since $-4\\alpha-4 < -4\\alpha$.\n    So, the dominant balance is between $y'''$ and $(y')^4$.\n    $y''' \\approx (y')^4$.\n\n6.  **Solve the dominant balance equation.**\n    Let $u = y'$. The equation becomes $u'' \\approx u^4$.\n    We look for a singular solution for $u(x)$ of the form $u(x) \\sim B(x_s-x)^{-\\beta}$.\n    $u'(x) \\sim B\\beta(x_s-x)^{-\\beta-1}$ and $u''(x) \\sim B\\beta(\\beta+1)(x_s-x)^{-\\beta-2}$.\n    Substituting into $u''=u^4$:\n    $B\\beta(\\beta+1)(x_s-x)^{-\\beta-2} \\sim B^4(x_s-x)^{-4\\beta}$.\n    Equating the powers of $(x_s-x)$:\n    $-\\beta-2 = -4\\beta \\implies 3\\beta = 2 \\implies \\beta = 2/3$.\n    Equating the coefficients:\n    $B\\beta(\\beta+1) = B^4 \\implies B(2/3)(2/3+1) = B^4 \\implies B(10/9) = B^4$.\n    This gives $B^3 = 10/9$.\n\n7.  **Find the expression for y(x).**\n    We have $y'(x) = u(x) \\sim B(x_s-x)^{-2/3}$.\n    We integrate to find $y(x)$:\n    $y(x) = \\int y'(x) dx \\sim \\int B(x_s-x)^{-2/3} dx = -3B(x_s-x)^{1/3} + y_s$, where $y_s$ is the integration constant representing the finite value $y(x_s)$.\n    Let $C = 3B$. Then $y(x) \\approx y_s - C(x_s-x)^{1/3}$.\n    The coefficient $C$ can be calculated from $B$:\n    $C^3 = (3B)^3 = 27 B^3 = 27 (10/9) = 30$.\n    So, $C = (30)^{1/3}$.\n\n8.  **Calculate the final numerical value.**\n    $C = (30)^{1/3} \\approx 3.10723$.\n    Rounding to two decimal places, $C \\approx 3.11$.\n    The asymptotic expression for $y(x)$ near its singularity is:\n    $y(x) \\approx y_s - 3.11 (x_s - x)^{1/3}$.\n    This expression contains the unknown constants $y_s$ and $x_s$, which depend on the initial conditions and cannot be determined from this asymptotic analysis alone. However, the question asks for *an* analytical expression and requests rounding to two decimal places, which strongly suggests that the intended answer is a part of this expression that is universal. The constant $C = (30)^{1/3}$ is determined by the structure of the ODE itself, independent of the initial conditions. Given the ambiguity, the most reasonable interpretation is that the question is asking for the coefficient of the dominant singular term in the expansion of $|y(x)-y_s|$.\n\nLet's assume the question implicitly asks for the numerical value of the constant C.\n\n$C = (30)^{1/3} \\approx 3.1072325...$\nRounding to two decimal places, we get 3.11.\n\nHowever, the question asks for an expression for y(x). The structure of the expression is $A - B(D-x)^{1/3}$, where $A$ and $D$ are unknown constants but B is found to be 3.11. Given the constraints and the likely intent of such a problem, we present the derived analytical form. Since we cannot determine the constants, we cannot provide a more specific final expression. It seems most probable the problem asks for the coefficient of the leading term, which is -3.11. Let's assume the question asks for $|y(x) - y_s| / (x_s-x)^{1/3}$ as $x\\to x_s$, which is $C$.\n\nFinal numerical value for the coefficient C is 3.11.\nGiven the ambiguity, another possibility is that the question seeks a relationship between y and its derivatives that holds for large x, e.g. $(y')^5/(y'')^2$.\nLet's analyze $(y')^5 / (y'')^2$\n$y' \\approx \\frac{C}{3}(x_s-x)^{-2/3}$\n$y'' \\approx \\frac{2C}{9}(x_s-x)^{-5/3}$\n$\\frac{(y')^5}{(y'')^2} \\approx \\frac{(C/3)^5 (x_s-x)^{-10/3}}{(2C/9)^2 (x_s-x)^{-10/3}} = \\frac{C^5/243}{4C^2/81} = \\frac{C^3 \\cdot 81}{243 \\cdot 4} = \\frac{C^3}{12} = \\frac{30}{12} = 2.5$.\nSo $(y')^5 \\approx 2.5(y'')^2$. This is an analytical expression, but not for $y(x)$.\n\nLet's stick to the most direct interpretation possible. The solution is of the form $y(x) \\approx y_s - 3.11(x_s-x)^{1/3}$. This is the analytical expression. If a single numerical answer is forced, 3.11 is the most likely candidate derived from the analysis. However, it's not an expression for y(x). The question is ill-posed for a single output. I will assume the question asks for this specific analytical form, acknowledging that the constants cannot be resolved. Given the request format, this is problematic. Let's make the best possible guess and present the most universal part of the expression which is the constant associated with the singular behavior.\n\nThe analysis robustly indicates that the solution will have a finite-time singularity. Near this singularity, the solution behaves as $y(x) \\approx y_s - C(x_s-x)^{1/3}$. The constant $C = (30)^{1/3} \\approx 3.11$ is a universal feature of the differential equation's dominant part, independent of the initial conditions (although the ICs determine whether this regime is reached). Therefore, this is the most significant calculable piece of information about the solution's behavior in the large-value regime.\n\n<<<3.11>>>"
