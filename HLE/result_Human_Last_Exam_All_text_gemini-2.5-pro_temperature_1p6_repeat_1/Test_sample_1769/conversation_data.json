    "This question requires a journey into historical linguistics, specifically the evolution of the English language.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the current word and its origin.**\n    *   The Modern English word for a female sibling is \"sister\".\n    *   This word is a loanword. It was borrowed into Old English from Old Norse, the language of the Vikings. The Old Norse word was \"systir\".\n    *   The Viking invasions and subsequent settlement in a large part of England (the Danelaw) from the 8th to the 11th centuries led to immense linguistic contact. As a result, many Old Norse words replaced their Old English counterparts. \"Sister\" is a prime example.\n\n2.  **Identify the original native Anglo-Saxon word.**\n    *   Before the Norse influence became dominant, the native Old English word for a female sibling was \"**sweostor**\".\n    *   Both Old English \"sweostor\" and Old Norse \"systir\" actually come from the same ancient root, Proto-Germanic `*swestēr`, which is why they look similar. However, they underwent different sound changes in their respective branches of the Germanic language family (West Germanic for English, North Germanic for Norse).\n\n3.  **Hypothesize the evolution of the native word without Norse influence.**\n    *   If the Norse had never invaded, the native word \"sweostor\" would have continued to evolve naturally along with the rest of the English language. We can predict its likely Modern English form by looking at how other similar Old English words changed over time.\n    *   **Old English to Middle English:** The Old English `eo` diphthong in `sweostor` typically underwent a change. The preceding `/w/` sound often had a \"rounding\" effect on the following vowel. This phonological process changed `sweostor` to \"**suster**\" in Middle English. This is not just a hypothesis; the form \"suster\" is well-attested in Middle English texts, used by prominent writers like Geoffrey Chaucer. It existed alongside the Norse-derived \"sister\", which eventually won out.\n    *   **Middle English to Modern English:** The next step is to see how the Middle English word \"suster\" would have evolved into Modern English. We need to look at the vowel sound. In Middle English, the `u` in \"suster\" was pronounced /ʊ/ (like the 'u' in \"put\").\n    *   During a major sound change event known as the Great Vowel Shift, this short /ʊ/ sound in many words evolved into the /ʌ/ sound (the \"STRUT\" vowel, like the 'u' in \"cut\" or \"cup\").\n    *   We see this exact change in other words:\n        *   Middle English `sunne` -> Modern English `sun`\n        *   Middle English `cutten` -> Modern English `cut`\n        *   Middle English `luve` -> Modern English `love`\n    *   Following this regular pattern, the Middle English \"suster\" /ˈsʊstər/ would have evolved into a Modern English word pronounced /ˈsʌstər/.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Loanword vs. Native Word:** It's crucial to distinguish that \"sister\" is a loanword and that a native equivalent, \"sweostor,\" already existed. The question hinges on the survival and evolution of this native word.\n*   **Phonological Rules:** The prediction isn't random. It follows known, regular patterns of sound change from Old to Middle English (`sweostor` > `suster`) and from Middle to Modern English (`u` as in 'put' > `u` as in 'cut').\n*   **Historical Attestation:** The hypothetical form is strengthened by the fact that its intermediate stage, \"suster,\" was actually a common word in Middle English before it was fully displaced.\n*   **Spelling:** The spelling would likely have remained the same as the Middle English form, \"suster\", even as the pronunciation of the vowel changed, similar to how we still write \"son\" or \"love\".\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nIf the Norse loanword \"sister\" had not entered the language, the native Old English \"sweostor\" would have evolved through the Middle English form \"suster\" to become the Modern English word **suster**.\n\n<<<suster>>>"
