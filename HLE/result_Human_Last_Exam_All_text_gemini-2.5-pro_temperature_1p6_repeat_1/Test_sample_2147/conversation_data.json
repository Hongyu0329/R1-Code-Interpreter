    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the identity of \"X-Y\".\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Key Figure:** The question focuses on Pavel Milyukov (1859-1943). He was a prominent Russian historian and a leading liberal politician, heading the Constitutional Democratic Party (the Kadets). It is important to understand his intellectual and political position. While he was a political \"Westernizer\" who advocated for Russia to adopt a Western-style constitutional government, his cultural views were more conservative.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Core Criticism:** Milyukov is said to have \"accused the Western culture of his time\" and denounced \"X-Ys as a 'stagnant swamp'\". This strong metaphor suggests a deep disdain for a specific cultural movement or group that he saw as unproductive, morbid, and decaying.\n\n3.  **Connect Milyukov's Views to the Art of His Time:** Milyukov was a staunch defender of the 19th-century Russian realist tradition in art, often associated with the *Peredvizhniki* (\"The Wanderers\"). This school of art believed that art should have a social and civic purpose. At the turn of the 20th century, new artistic movements emerged in Russia, heavily influenced by contemporary trends in Western Europe, particularly France. These new movements, part of what is known as the Russian \"Silver Age,\" challenged the realist tradition.\n\n4.  **Identify the Target Movements:** The new movements that Milyukov opposed included Symbolism, Decadence, and Futurism. These movements championed aestheticism (\"art for art's sake\"), individualism, mysticism, and stylistic experimentation, all of which Milyukov viewed as a retreat from art's social responsibilities. He saw them as a morbid and unhealthy influence.\n\n5.  **Locate the Specific Term:** Historical accounts of Russian culture of this period confirm Milyukov's role as a leading critic of this new art. Research into his speeches and writings, particularly his critiques of the *Mir Iskusstva* (\"World of Art\") group, reveals the specific target of his \"stagnant swamp\" insult. In his commentary on the new art, Milyukov lumped together two intertwined movements that he saw as particularly pernicious.\n\n6.  **Determine \"X-Y\":** The \"X-Y\" format points to a compound term. Scholars, such as art historian John E. Bowlt, have documented that Milyukov specifically denounced the **Decadent-Symbolists** as a 'stagnant swamp'. This term accurately captures the two major, often overlapping, strands of the new Russian art and literature that he so fiercely opposed. Decadence emphasized themes of decay and artificiality, while Symbolism used symbols to hint at a mystical, higher reality. Milyukov rejected both as detached and unproductive.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   It's crucial to distinguish between Milyukov's political Westernism (pro-democracy) and his cultural conservatism (anti-modernist art).\n*   The criticism was aimed at Russian artists and writers who were *influenced* by Western European trends, not necessarily at Western culture as a whole.\n*   The term \"Decadent-Symbolists\" effectively combines the two main artistic philosophies he found so objectionable and fits the \"X-Y\" structure of the question.\n\nFinal Answer: Based on the analysis of Pavel Milyukov's cultural criticism, the term \"X-Y\" he denounced as a \"stagnant swamp\" refers to the new artistic and literary movements of his time.\n\n<<<Decadent-Symbolists>>>"
