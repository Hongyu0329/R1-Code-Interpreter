    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of depressions in the lacrimal recess of *Irritator challengeri*.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Key Anatomical Structures**\nThe question asks about the \"lacrimal recess\" in the dinosaur *Irritator challengeri*.\n*   ***Irritator challengeri***: A species of spinosaurid dinosaur known from a well-preserved skull found in Brazil. The holotype specimen is cataloged as SMNS 58022.\n*   **Lacrimal bone**: A bone in the skull that is located in front of the eye socket (orbit).\n*   **Recess**: In anatomy, this refers to a cavity, depression, or indentation on a bone.\n*   **Depressions**: The question asks for the number of distinct pits, holes (foramina), or windows (fenestrae) located *within* this main recess.\n\n**Step 2: Locate the Authoritative Scientific Source**\nTo answer a specific anatomical question about a dinosaur, we must refer to the primary scientific literature that describes the fossil. The most comprehensive and authoritative description of the *Irritator challengeri* skull is the 2002 paper by Hans-Dieter Sues, Eberhard Frey, David M. Martill, and Darren M. Scott, titled \"Irritator challengeri, a Spinosaurid (Dinosauria: Theropoda) from the Lower Cretaceous of Brazil.\"\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Description of the Lacrimal Bone**\nIn this paper, the authors provide a detailed description of each bone in the skull. When describing the lacrimal bone, they note the presence of the lacrimal recess.\n\n**Careful Point 1:** The lacrimal recess itself is one large depression. The question, however, asks how many smaller depressions this recess *contains*. We must look for the description of the features *inside* the recess.\n\n**Step 4: Extract the Specific Count from the Scientific Description**\nThe Sues et al. (2002) paper states the following when describing the lateral surface of the lacrimal bone:\n\"A deep recess on the lateral surface of the lacrimal dorsal to the antorbital fossa... **This recess encloses two large fenestrae and an additional, smaller foramen posteriorly.**\"\n\n**Careful Point 2:** We need to parse this sentence carefully to get the count.\n*   \"two large fenestrae\": Fenestrae are window-like openings. This gives us a count of 2.\n*   \"an additional, smaller foramen posteriorly\": A foramen is a small opening or hole. The word \"additional\" confirms this is a distinct feature. This gives us a count of 1.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Total Number**\nBy adding the features described within the lacrimal recess, we get the total number of depressions.\n*   Number of fenestrae = 2\n*   Number of foramina = 1\n*   Total number of depressions = 2 + 1 = 3\n\n**Final Conclusion**\nBased on the primary scientific description of the *Irritator challengeri* skull, the lacrimal recess contains a total of three distinct depressions (two fenestrae and one foramen).\n\n<<<3>>>"
