    "Answering this question requires a careful analysis of the properties of a toroidal chessboard and a systematic counting method.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\n*   **Board:** A 5x5 toroidal chessboard. This means the board wraps around from top to bottom and left to right. We can represent the squares by coordinates `(r, c)` where `r` and `c` are integers from 0 to 4. All arithmetic on coordinates is performed modulo 5.\n*   **Pieces:** 4 Queens. The queens are identical (indistinguishable).\n*   **Constraint:** The queens must be \"non-attacking\". On a toroidal board, a queen at `(r1, c1)` attacks a square `(r2, c2)` if any of the following conditions are met:\n    1.  **Row attack:** `r1 = r2`\n    2.  **Column attack:** `c1 = c2`\n    3.  **Main diagonal attack:** `(r1 - c1) % 5 = (r2 - c2) % 5`\n    4.  **Anti-diagonal attack:** `(r1 + c1) % 5 = (r2 + c2) % 5`\n\nThe problem is to find the number of ways to place 4 queens on this board such that no two queens attack each other.\n\n### Step 2: Devising a Counting Strategy\nA direct brute-force check of all `C(25, 4) = 12,650` placements would be tedious. A better approach is to build valid placements queen by queen, using the board's symmetries to reduce the number of cases we need to consider.\n\nThe strategy is as follows:\n1.  Place the first queen, `Q1`. Due to the high degree of symmetry on a torus (any square can be moved to any other square), we can place `Q1` at a fixed position, say `(0, 0)`, and then multiply the final count by the total number of squares, 25.\n2.  Place the second queen, `Q2`, in a position not attacked by `Q1`. We will analyze the available positions for `Q2` and group them into equivalence classes based on the board's symmetry.\n3.  For each representative case for `Q2`, we will find the number of ways to place the remaining two queens, `Q3` and `Q4`.\n4.  Sum the results, adjust for symmetries, and divide by the number of permutations of the queens to get the number of unique sets of placements.\n\n### Step 3: Step-by-Step Calculation\n\n**Placement of Q1:**\nLet's place `Q1` at `(0, 0)`. We will multiply the result by 25 at the end.\n\n**Placement of Q2:**\n`Q2` must be placed at `(r, c)` such that it is not attacked by `Q1(0, 0)`.\n*   `r ≠ 0` and `c ≠ 0`.\n*   `r - c ≠ 0 (mod 5)` which means `r ≠ c`.\n*   `r + c ≠ 0 (mod 5)` which means `r + c ≠ 5`.\n\nLet's list the valid spots for `Q2(r, c)` where `r, c ∈ {1, 2, 3, 4}`:\n*   If `r=1`, `c` cannot be `1` or `4`. So `c` can be `2` or `3`. Positions: `(1,2), (1,3)`.\n*   If `r=2`, `c` cannot be `2` or `3`. So `c` can be `1` or `4`. Positions: `(2,1), (2,4)`.\n*   If `r=3`, `c` cannot be `3` or `2`. So `c` can be `1` or `4`. Positions: `(3,1), (3,4)`.\n*   If `r=4`, `c` cannot be `4` or `1`. So `c` can be `2` or `3`. Positions: `(4,2), (4,3)`.\nThere are 8 possible positions for `Q2`. These 8 positions fall into two distinct orbits under rotation around `(0,0)`:\n*   **Orbit A (Knight's move):** `{(1,2), (2,4), (4,3), (3,1)}` (4 positions)\n*   **Orbit B (other):** `{(1,3), (3,4), (4,2), (2,1)}` (4 positions)\nDue to symmetry (rotation and reflection), the number of ways to complete a placement will be the same for all positions within an orbit, and also the same for Orbit A and Orbit B. Thus, we only need to calculate the continuations for one case, for instance `Q2 = (1,2)`, and the result will be the same for all 8 choices.\n\n**Placement of Q3 and Q4 (given Q1=(0,0), Q2=(1,2))**\nWe need to find the number of ordered pairs `(Q3, Q4)` that can complete the placement.\nGiven `Q1=(0,0)` and `Q2=(1,2)`, the attacked rows are `{0,1}`, columns are `{0,2}`, main diagonals are `{0, -1=4}`, and anti-diagonals are `{0, 3}`.\n\nA valid `Q3 = (r, c)` cannot be in these rows, columns, or diagonals.\nLet's find the valid positions for `Q3`:\n*   `r` must be in `{2, 3, 4}`.\n*   `c` must be in `{1, 3, 4}`.\n*   Checking the 9 possible `(r,c)` pairs against the diagonal constraints, we find 3 valid positions for `Q3`: `(2,4)`, `(3,1)`, and `(4,3)`.\n\nFor each of these 3 choices for `Q3`, we count the valid positions for `Q4`:\n1.  **If `Q3 = (2,4)`:** The newly attacked rows/cols/diagonals leave 2 valid spots for `Q4`: `(3,1)` and `(4,3)`.\n2.  **If `Q3 = (3,1)`:** The newly attacked rows/cols/diagonals leave 2 valid spots for `Q4`: `(2,4)` and `(4,3)`.\n3.  **If `Q3 = (4,3)`:** The newly attacked rows/cols/diagonals leave 2 valid spots for `Q4`: `(2,4)` and `(3,1)`.\n\nIn each case, there are 2 choices for `Q4`.\nThe number of ways to choose an ordered pair `(Q3, Q4)` given `Q1=(0,0)` and `Q2=(1,2)` is `3 (choices for Q3) * 2 (choices for Q4) = 6`.\n\n### Step 4: Final Calculation\n1.  **Number of ordered placements:** We count the total number of ordered tuples `(Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4)` of valid placements.\n    *   There are 25 choices for `Q1`.\n    *   For each choice of `Q1`, there are 8 choices for `Q2`.\n    *   For each pair `(Q1, Q2)`, there are 6 ways to place an ordered pair `(Q3, Q4)`.\n    *   Total ordered placements `N_ord = 25 * 8 * 6 = 1200`.\n\n2.  **Number of unordered sets:** The queens are identical, so the order in which we placed them doesn't matter. We have counted each unique set of 4 positions `4! = 24` times (once for each permutation of the 4 queens). To get the number of unique sets, we divide the number of ordered placements by 24.\n    *   Number of ways = `N_ord / 4! = 1200 / 24 = 50`.\n\n### Sanity Check via an Alternative Method\nIt is a known theorem that for a `p x p` toroidal board where `p` is a prime (`p=5` in our case), any valid placement of `p-1` non-attacking queens can be uniquely extended to a valid placement of `p` queens. This implies a direct relationship:\n*   Number of (p-1)-queen placements = (Number of p-queen placements) * `p`.\n\nFor `p=5`, Number of 4-queen placements = (Number of 5-queen placements) * 5.\nThe number of ways to place 5 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal board (`N_5`) can be shown to be 10. These solutions correspond to linear permutations `p(i) = ai+b` where `i` is the row and `p(i)` is the column, and `a, a-1, a+1` are non-zero modulo 5. For `n=5`, `a` can be 2 or 3, and `b` can be any of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, giving `2 * 5 = 10` solutions.\nThus, the number of 4-queen placements = `10 * 5 = 50`.\n\nBoth methods yield the same result, which gives us confidence in the answer."
