    "To find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $N = 36036$ and order $6$, we follow a step-by-step analysis.\n\n**Step 1: Factorize the conductor N**\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of $N$.\n$N = 36036 = 36 \\times 1001 = (4 \\times 9) \\times (7 \\times 11 \\times 13)$.\nThe prime power factorization is $N = 2^2 \\times 3^2 \\times 7^1 \\times 11^1 \\times 13^1$.\n\n**Step 2: Structure of Dirichlet Characters**\nA Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $N$ can be uniquely decomposed into a product of characters modulo the prime power factors of $N$.\n$\\chi = \\chi_{4} \\chi_{9} \\chi_{7} \\chi_{11} \\chi_{13}$, where $\\chi_{p^a}$ is a Dirichlet character modulo $p^a$.\n\n**Step 3: Condition for a Primitive Character**\nA character $\\chi$ is primitive with conductor $N$ if and only if each of its component characters $\\chi_{p^a}$ is a primitive character modulo its corresponding prime power $p^a$. The conductor of $\\chi$ is the product of the conductors of its components. For $\\text{cond}(\\chi) = N$, we must have $\\text{cond}(\\chi_{p^a}) = p^a$ for each $p^a$ in the factorization of $N$.\n\n**Step 4: Condition on the Order of the Character**\nThe order of the character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters:\n$ \\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_{4}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{9}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{7}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{11}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{13})) $.\nWe are given that the order of $\\chi$ must be $6$. This implies two things:\n1.  The order of each component character, $\\text{ord}(\\chi_{p^a})$, must be a divisor of $6$.\n2.  The lcm of the orders must be exactly $6$.\n\n**Step 5: Count the number of choices for each primitive component character**\nWe need to find the number of primitive characters for each modulus $p^a$ whose order divides 6. The number of characters of order $d$ in a cyclic group of order $m$ (where $d|m$) is $\\phi(d)$.\n\n*   **Modulo 4 ($2^2$):**\n    The group of characters modulo 4 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_2$. There are $\\phi(4)=2$ characters. The principal character has conductor 1 and is not primitive. The other character has order 2 and conductor 4, so it is primitive. Its order is 2, which divides 6.\n    *   Number of choices for $\\chi_4$: 1 (the unique primitive character of order 2).\n\n*   **Modulo 9 ($3^2$):**\n    The group of characters modulo 9 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/9\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_6$. There are $\\phi(9)=6$ characters. The non-primitive characters are induced from characters modulo 3. The group $(\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_2$ has characters of order 1 and 2. So, the characters modulo 9 of orders 1 and 2 are not primitive. The primitive characters are those of orders 3 and 6. Both 3 and 6 divide 6.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$.\n    *   Total choices for $\\chi_9$: $2 + 2 = 4$.\n\n*   **Modulo 7:**\n    The group of characters is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_6$. All non-principal characters are primitive, so there are $\\phi(7)-1=5$ primitive characters. Their orders are the divisors of 6, except 1. Orders are 2, 3, and 6. All of these divide 6.\n    *   Number of characters of order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$.\n    *   Number of characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n    *   Number of characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$.\n    *   Total choices for $\\chi_7$: $1 + 2 + 2 = 5$.\n\n*   **Modulo 11:**\n    The group of characters is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/11\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_{10}$. All non-principal characters are primitive. We need the order to divide 6. The possible orders are divisors of 10, i.e., 1, 2, 5, 10. The only non-trivial order that also divides 6 is 2.\n    *   Number of characters of order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$.\n    *   Total choices for $\\chi_{11}$: 1.\n\n*   **Modulo 13:**\n    The group of characters is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/13\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_{12}$. All non-principal characters are primitive. We need the order to divide 6. The possible orders are divisors of 12, i.e., 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12. The orders that also divide 6 are 2, 3, and 6.\n    *   Number of characters of order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$.\n    *   Number of characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n    *   Number of characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$.\n    *   Total choices for $\\chi_{13}$: $1 + 2 + 2 = 5$.\n\n**Step 6: Combine the results and verify the final order**\nTo get a primitive character $\\chi$ of conductor $N$ whose components have orders dividing 6, we can choose any combination of the component characters counted above. The total number of such characters is the product of the number of choices for each component:\nTotal combinations = $1 \\times 4 \\times 5 \\times 1 \\times 5 = 100$.\n\nNow we must verify that for every one of these 100 characters, the order is exactly 6.\nLet the orders of the components be $(o_4, o_9, o_7, o_{11}, o_{13})$.\nThe order of the final character $\\chi$ is $O = \\text{lcm}(o_4, o_9, o_7, o_{11}, o_{13})$.\n\nFrom our selection process:\n*   All component orders $o_i$ are divisors of 6. Therefore, their lcm, $O$, must also divide 6.\n*   The order of $\\chi_4$ is exactly 2 ($o_4=2$). This means $O$ must be a multiple of 2.\n*   The order of $\\chi_9$ must be 3 or 6 ($o_9 \\in \\{3,6\\}$). In either case, $o_9$ is a multiple of 3. This means $O$ must be a multiple of 3.\n\nSince $O$ is a multiple of both 2 and 3, it must be a multiple of $\\text{lcm}(2, 3) = 6$.\nWe have established that $O$ divides 6 and is a multiple of 6. The only integer with this property is 6 itself.\nTherefore, every one of the 100 combinations results in a character of order exactly 6.\n\nThe number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $36036$ and order $6$ is 100."
