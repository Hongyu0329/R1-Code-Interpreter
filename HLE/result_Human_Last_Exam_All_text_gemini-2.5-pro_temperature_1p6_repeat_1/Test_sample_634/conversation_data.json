    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of the given polynomial matrices.\n\n**1. Understand the Problem**\n\nWe are asked to find the Greatest Common Right Divisor (GCRD) of two polynomial matrices:\nP1 = [s^2 + s, -s; -s^2 - 1, s^2]\nP2 = [s, 0; -s - 1, 1]\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   A matrix R(s) is a **right divisor** of P(s) if P(s) = Q(s)R(s) for some polynomial matrix Q(s).\n*   A matrix G(s) is a **GCRD** if it is a common right divisor of P1 and P2, and any other common right divisor is a right divisor of G(s).\n*   The GCRD is not unique. If G(s) is a GCRD, then U(s)G(s) is also a GCRD for any unimodular matrix U(s) (a polynomial matrix with a constant, non-zero determinant). We usually seek a GCRD in a simplified or canonical form.\n\n**2. Method: Euclidean Algorithm for Matrices**\n\nThe most reliable method is to use the matrix equivalent of the Euclidean algorithm. This involves performing elementary row operations on the stacked matrix M(s) = [P1(s); P2(s)] to reduce it to the form [G(s); 0]. The resulting non-zero matrix G(s) will be a GCRD of P1(s) and P2(s).\n\n**3. Step-by-Step Execution**\n\n**Step 3.1: Form the stacked matrix M(s).**\nM(s) =\n[ s^2 + s,  -s   ] (Row 1)\n[ -s^2 - 1, s^2  ] (Row 2)\n[ s       ,  0    ] (Row 3)\n[ -s - 1  ,  1    ] (Row 4)\n\n**Step 3.2: Perform elementary row operations to simplify M(s).**\nIt's often easier to work with lower-degree polynomial rows. Let's reorder the rows to bring R3 and R4 to the top.\n\n[ s       ,  0    ]\n[ -s - 1  ,  1    ]\n[ s^2 + s,  -s   ]\n[ -s^2 - 1, s^2  ]\n\nNow, use the top rows to eliminate the leading terms in the rows below them. Let the new rows be r1, r2, r3, r4.\n*   `r3 -> r3 - (s+1)*r1`:  [s^2+s, -s] - (s+1)[s, 0] = [s^2+s - s(s+1), -s - 0] = [0, -s]\n*   `r4 -> r4 + s*r1`: [-s^2-1, s^2] + s[s, 0] = [-s^2-1+s^2, s^2+0] = [-1, s^2]\n\nThe matrix becomes:\n[ s       ,  0    ]\n[ -s - 1  ,  1    ]\n[ 0       , -s   ]\n[ -1      , s^2  ]\n\n**Step 3.3: Continue the reduction.**\nThe new fourth row [-1, s^2] has a constant in the first column, which is excellent for pivoting. Let's move it to the top.\n\n[ -1      , s^2  ]\n[ s       ,  0    ]\n[ -s - 1  ,  1    ]\n[ 0       , -s   ]\n\nNow, use the new top row to eliminate the entries below it in the first column. Let the new rows be R1, R2, R3, R4.\n*   `R2 -> R2 + s*R1`: [s, 0] + s[-1, s^2] = [s-s, 0+s^3] = [0, s^3]\n*   `R3 -> R3 - (s+1)*R1`: [-s-1, 1] - (s+1)[-1, s^2] = [-s-1, 1] - [-s-1, s^3+s^2] = [0, 1 - s^3 - s^2]\n\nThe matrix is now:\n[ -1      , s^2           ]\n[ 0       , s^3           ]\n[ 0       , 1 - s^3 - s^2 ]\n[ 0       , -s            ]\n\n**Step 3.4: Reduce the submatrix.**\nWe now focus on rows 2, 3, and 4. The row [0, -s] has the lowest degree in the second column. Let's move it up to act as the next pivot.\n\n[ -1      , s^2           ]\n[ 0       , -s            ]\n[ 0       , s^3           ]\n[ 0       , 1 - s^3 - s^2 ]\n\nUse the new second row R2' = [0, -s] to eliminate entries below it.\n*   `R3' -> R3' + s^2*R2'`: [0, s^3] + s^2[0, -s] = [0, s^3-s^3] = [0, 0]\n*   For R4', we perform polynomial division: (1 - s^3 - s^2) / (-s). The quotient is (s^2 + s) and the remainder is 1. The operation is `R4' -> R4' - (s^2+s)*R2'`.\n    `R4' ->`: [0, 1 - s^3 - s^2] - (s^2+s)[0, -s] = [0, 1 - s^3 - s^2 - (-s^3-s^2)] = [0, 1]\n\nThe matrix simplifies to:\n[ -1, s^2 ]\n[ 0 , -s  ]\n[ 0 , 0   ]\n[ 0 , 1   ]\n\n**Step 3.5: Final reduction.**\nThe row [0, 1] is a powerful pivot. Let's reorder to place it in the second row.\n\n[ -1, s^2 ]\n[ 0 , 1   ]\n[ 0 , -s  ]\n[ 0 , 0   ]\n\nUse the new second row R2'' = [0, 1] to clear the second column entries in other rows.\n*   `R1'' -> R1'' - s^2*R2''`: [-1, s^2] - s^2[0, 1] = [-1, s^2-s^2] = [-1, 0]\n*   `R3'' -> R3'' + s*R2''`: [0, -s] + s[0, 1] = [0, -s+s] = [0, 0]\n\nThe final matrix is:\n[ -1, 0 ]\n[ 0 , 1 ]\n[ 0 , 0 ]\n[ 0 , 0 ]\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nThe reduction of the stacked matrix [P1; P2] yields a non-zero part G = [-1, 0; 0, 1]. By the properties of the matrix Euclidean algorithm, G is a GCRD of P1 and P2.\n\n**Careful Point:** A GCRD is not unique. Any matrix G' = U*G, where U is unimodular, is also a GCRD. The matrix G we found has a determinant of -1, so it is unimodular. This means P1 and P2 are **right coprime**.\n\nFor right coprime matrices, a standard canonical choice for the GCRD is the identity matrix, I. We can obtain I from our result G by left-multiplying with the unimodular matrix U = [-1, 0; 0, 1]:\nU*G = [-1, 0; 0, 1] * [-1, 0; 0, 1] = [1, 0; 0, 1] = I.\n\nTherefore, the greatest common right divisor is the identity matrix.\n\nFinal Answer:\nThe greatest common right divisor is:\n[ 1, 0 ]\n[ 0, 1 ]\n\n<<<[1, 0; 0, 1]>>>"
