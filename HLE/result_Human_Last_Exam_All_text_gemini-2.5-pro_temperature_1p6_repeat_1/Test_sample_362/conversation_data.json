    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the Wittig reaction to determine the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the reactants and their structures.**\n\n*   **Reactant 1: Pivalaldehyde**\n    *   Also known as 2,2-dimethylpropanal.\n    *   It consists of a tert-butyl group (`-C(CH₃)₃`) attached to an aldehyde functional group (`-CHO`).\n    *   Structure:\n        ```\n          CH₃\n          |\n        CH₃-C-CH=O\n          |\n         CH₃\n        ```\n\n*   **Reactant 2: (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ⁵-phosphane**\n    *   This is the Wittig reagent, also known as a phosphorus ylide.\n    *   The `triphenyl-λ⁵-phosphane` part corresponds to `=PPh₃`.\n    *   The `(2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)` part is the group attached to the phosphorus via a double bond. Let's break it down:\n        *   `ethylidene`: A two-carbon group derived from ethane, with a double bond from carbon 1: `CH₃-C(2)H₂-C(1)H=`\n        *   `2-(2-chlorophenyl)`: A substituent on carbon 2 of the ethylidene group. The `2-chlorophenyl` group is a benzene ring with a chlorine atom at the ortho position.\n    *   Combining these parts, the structure of the ylide is:\n        ```\n           Cl\n          /\n        (Ph)-CH₂-CH=PPh₃\n        ```\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Wittig Reaction Mechanism.**\n\nThe Wittig reaction is a powerful method for synthesizing alkenes. The core transformation involves the reaction of a carbonyl compound (an aldehyde or a ketone) with a phosphorus ylide. The carbonyl oxygen is replaced by the ylide's carbanionic carbon, forming a C=C double bond. The other product is triphenylphosphine oxide (`Ph₃P=O`).\n\nGeneral scheme:\nR₁R₂C=O + R₃R₄C=PPh₃  →  R₁R₂C=CR₃R₄ + Ph₃P=O\n\n**Step 3: Apply the mechanism to the specific reactants.**\n\n*   From pivalaldehyde, we get the `(CH₃)₃C-CH=` part of the new alkene.\n*   From the ylide, we get the `=CH-CH₂-(2-chlorophenyl)` part of the new alkene.\n*   Combining these two fragments at the double bond gives the structure of the product:\n    `(CH₃)₃C-CH=CH-CH₂-(2-chlorophenyl)`\n\n**Step 4: Determine the stereochemistry (E/Z Isomerism) of the product.**\n\nThe stereochemical outcome of a Wittig reaction depends on the stability of the ylide.\n\n*   **Stabilized ylides** (where the carbanionic carbon is attached to an electron-withdrawing group like `-COR`, `-CN`, or `-Ph`) typically yield the more thermodynamically stable **E-alkene** (trans).\n*   **Unstabilized ylides** (where the carbanionic carbon is attached to alkyl groups) are more reactive and the reaction is kinetically controlled, typically yielding the **Z-alkene** (cis) as the major product.\n\nLet's analyze our ylide: `(2-chlorophenyl)-CH₂-CH=PPh₃`. The carbanionic carbon (the one bonded to P) is attached to a hydrogen atom and a `-(CH₂)-(2-chlorophenyl)` group. Since the phenyl ring is separated from the carbanionic center by a `CH₂` (methylene) spacer, there is no resonance stabilization. Therefore, this is considered an **unstabilized ylide**.\n\nWhen an unstabilized ylide reacts with an aldehyde (like pivalaldehyde), the reaction kinetically favors the formation of the **Z-isomer**.\n\nLet's assign the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities to the groups on the double bond to determine the Z configuration:\n` (t-Bu) - CH(a) = CH(b) - (CH₂-Ar) `\n\n*   On carbon (a): The tert-butyl group `(t-Bu)` has a higher priority than the hydrogen `(H)`.\n*   On carbon (b): The `-(CH₂)-(2-chlorophenyl)` group has a higher priority than the hydrogen `(H)`.\n\nFor the **Z-isomer** (from the German *zusammen*, meaning \"together\"), the two higher-priority groups must be on the same side of the double bond.\n```\n   (CH₃)₃C          CH₂-(2-chlorophenyl)\n          \\        /\n           C === C\n          /        \\\n         H          H\n```\nThis is the expected major product.\n\n**Step 5: Name the final product.**\n\n1.  Identify the longest carbon chain containing the double bond.\n    `(2-ClPh)-C(1)H₂-C(2)H=C(3)H-C(4)(CH₃)₂-C(5)H₃`\n2.  The parent chain is a pentene. The double bond starts at C-2, so it is a `pent-2-ene`.\n3.  Identify and number the substituents:\n    *   A `2-chlorophenyl` group is on carbon 1.\n    *   Two `methyl` groups are on carbon 4.\n4.  Assemble the name alphabetically, including the stereochemical prefix: `(Z)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene`.\n\nThe final product from the Wittig reaction of pivalaldehyde with (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-l5-phosphane is the Z-isomer of 1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene.\n\n<<< (Z)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene >>>"
