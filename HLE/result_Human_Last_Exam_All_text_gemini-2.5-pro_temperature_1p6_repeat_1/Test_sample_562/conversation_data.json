    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the radical of the kanji 謄.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Kanji:** First, we look at the structure of the character 謄. Kanji are often composed of smaller, simpler components. We can see that 謄 is a compound character with a left-right structure.\n    *   The left component is: 言\n    *   The right component is: 朕\n\n2.  **Identify the Radical (Bushu):** In most kanji with a left-right structure, the left-side component functions as the radical (部首, bushu). The radical is the part of the character used for classification in dictionaries and often gives a clue to the character's general meaning.\n    *   The left component, 言, is a standard radical. It relates to meanings such as \"word,\" \"speech,\" \"language,\" or \"to say.\"\n    *   The meaning of 謄 is \"to transcribe\" or \"to copy,\" which is directly related to the concept of words and documents. Therefore, 言 is correctly identified as the radical.\n\n3.  **Determine the Name of the Radical:** Each radical has a specific Japanese name, which can change depending on its position within a character.\n    *   The radical is 言. The most common readings for this character are `gon` or `gen`.\n    *   When a radical appears on the left side of a kanji, it is called a \"hen\" (or \"ben\" due to voicing changes, known as rendaku).\n    *   Combining the radical's name with its position, the radical 言 on the left side is called \"gonben\" (ごんべん).\n\n4.  **Transcribe into Hepburn:** The final step is to write the Japanese name \"ごんべん\" using Hepburn romanization, which is the standard system for transcribing Japanese into the Latin alphabet.\n    *   ご (go) + ん (n) + べ (be) + ん (n) = gonben.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Radical Position:** It's crucial to identify the correct position of the radical (left, right, top, bottom, etc.) as this determines its positional name (hen, tsukuri, kanmuri, ashi, etc.). In this case, 言 is on the left, making it a \"hen\" (or \"ben\").\n*   **Correct Radical Name:** Some radicals have multiple names. For 言, \"gon\" is the standard reading used in its radical name \"gonben\".\n*   **Phonetic vs. Semantic Component:** The right side (朕) in this character is primarily a phonetic component, giving a clue to the character's pronunciation (tō), while the left side (言) is the semantic component (the radical) indicating the meaning. Recognizing this distinction helps confirm the radical.\n*   **Hepburn Romanization:** Be precise with the romanization. \"Gonben\" is the correct Hepburn transcription for ごんべん.\n\nBy following these steps, we confidently arrive at the answer.\n\n<<<Gonben>>>"
