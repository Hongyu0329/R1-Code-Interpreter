    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of each ballet step to determine which one ends in the same leg position as it started.\n\n**Analysis of the Question:**\nThe question asks to identify a classical ballet step from the given options where the final position of the feet is identical to the initial position. For example, if a step starts in the fifth position with the right foot in front, it must also end in the fifth position with the right foot in front.\n\n---\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis of Each Answer Choice:\n\n**A. Entrechat six**\n*   **Starting Position:** Typically fifth position, either in plié or on pointe (e.g., right foot front).\n*   **Execution:** This is a jump where the dancer's legs beat against each other six times (three openings and three closings). Let's trace the feet starting with the right foot in front:\n    1.  Jump from fifth position.\n    2.  Legs beat (left foot passes in front of the right).\n    3.  Legs beat (right foot passes in front of the left).\n    4.  Legs beat to land (left foot passes in front of the right to land).\n*   **Ending Position:** The dancer lands in the fifth position, but with the opposite foot in front (e.g., left foot front).\n*   **Careful Point:** All even-numbered entrechats (quatre, six, huit) land with the feet changed from the starting position. Odd-numbered entrechats (trois, cinq) land on one foot.\n*   **Conclusion:** The start and end positions are different.\n\n**B. Échappé battu changé**\n*   **Starting Position:** Fifth position in plié (e.g., right foot front).\n*   **Execution:**\n    *   \"Échappé\" means to escape. The dancer jumps from fifth position to second position.\n    *   \"Battu\" means beaten. As the legs close from second position, they beat together in the air.\n    *   \"Changé\" means changed. This word explicitly tells us the feet will switch their position.\n*   **Ending Position:** The dancer lands in the fifth position with the opposite foot in front (e.g., left foot front).\n*   **Careful Point:** The name itself indicates a change of feet.\n*   **Conclusion:** The start and end positions are different.\n\n**C. Assemblé**\n*   **Starting Position:** Typically fifth position in plié (e.g., right foot front).\n*   **Execution:** The name \"assemblé\" means \"to assemble\" or \"to join together\".\n    1.  The dancer brushes one leg (the working leg) out to the side, front, or back.\n    2.  The dancer then pushes off the supporting leg to jump.\n    3.  In the air, both legs are brought together (\"assembled\") into fifth position.\n    4.  The dancer lands on both feet simultaneously in fifth position.\n*   **Ending Position:** In a standard, unmodified assemblé (e.g., assemblé dessus or dessous), the dancer lands in the same fifth position they started in (e.g., right foot front).\n*   **Careful Point:** While there is a variation called *assemblé changé*, the fundamental step simply called \"assemblé\" does not change the feet. Its core mechanic is to separate and reassemble the legs to the original position.\n*   **Conclusion:** The start and end positions are the same.\n\n**D. Glissade derrière**\n*   **Starting Position:** Fifth position in plié (e.g., right foot front).\n*   **Execution:** \"Glissade\" means \"to glide,\" and \"derrière\" means \"behind.\" This is a connecting, traveling step. The terminology can be interpreted differently across ballet schools, leading to ambiguity.\n    *   **Interpretation 1 (e.g., Vaganova):** Starting with the right foot front and traveling right, the right foot glides to the side, and the left foot closes *behind* it. This results in the right foot remaining in front. No change.\n    *   **Interpretation 2 (e.g., ABT Dictionary):** The foot that is in the back (the left foot) glides out first, and the other foot (the right foot) closes behind it. This results in the left foot being in front at the end. The feet have changed.\n*   **Careful Point:** Due to the conflicting definitions in different pedagogical systems, this is an ambiguous choice. However, changing glissades are very common as preparatory steps. Compared to the clear definition of a basic assemblé, this is a less certain answer.\n*   **Conclusion:** The outcome can vary, but in many common interpretations, the feet change.\n\n**E. Gargouillade**\n*   **Starting Position:** Usually fifth position.\n*   **Execution:** This is a complex, decorative step, often described as a \"gurgling\" or \"rumbling\" movement. It's similar to a pas de chat but involves a double rond de jambe in the air—one with each leg. The common execution of the step involves landing with the feet switched.\n*   **Ending Position:** Typically, the dancer lands in the fifth position with the opposite foot in front.\n*   **Careful Point:** While it can technically be performed without changing feet, the standard, fluid version results in a change.\n*   **Conclusion:** The start and end positions are typically different.\n\n### Final Summary:\n\n*   **Entrechat six:** Changes feet.\n*   **Échappé battu changé:** Changes feet (by name).\n*   **Assemblé:** Does not change feet in its fundamental form.\n*   **Glissade derrière:** Ambiguous, but often changes feet.\n*   **Gargouillade:** Typically changes feet.\n\nThe most accurate and unambiguous answer is **Assemblé**, as the core principle of the step is to bring the legs back together into their starting formation.\n\n<<<C>>>"
