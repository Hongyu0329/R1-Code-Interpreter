    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of internal adjunctions in the simplex category $\\Delta$ from $[23]$ to $[37]$.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the context and definitions**\n\n*   **The simplex category $\\Delta$**: The objects of $\\Delta$ are the non-empty finite ordinals, denoted by $[n] = \\{0, 1, \\dots, n\\}$ for any non-negative integer $n$. The morphisms are order-preserving functions $f: [m] \\to [n]$, i.e., if $i \\le j$ in $[m]$, then $f(i) \\le f(j)$ in $[n]$.\n*   **$\\Delta$ as a locally posetal 2-subcategory of $\\mathsf{Pos}$**: This means that in addition to the objects and morphisms, we consider 2-morphisms between parallel morphisms. For two morphisms $f, g: [m] \\to [n]$, a 2-morphism from $f$ to $g$ exists if and only if $f(i) \\le g(i)$ for all $i \\in [m]$. We denote this by $f \\le g$. This structure makes each hom-set $\\text{Hom}_{\\Delta}([m], [n])$ a partially ordered set (a poset).\n*   **Internal adjunction from $[m]$ to $[n]$**: In a 2-category, an adjunction between two objects, say $X$ and $Y$, consists of a pair of morphisms $L: X \\to Y$ and $R: Y \\to X$ (called the left and right adjoints, respectively) and two 2-morphisms:\n    1.  The **unit** $\\eta: \\text{id}_X \\to R \\circ L$.\n    2.  The **counit** $\\epsilon: L \\circ R \\to \\text{id}_Y$.\n    These must satisfy the triangle identities, which hold automatically in any locally posetal 2-category.\n\n**Step 2: Translate the definition of an adjunction into concrete conditions**\n\nFor our specific case, an adjunction from $[m]=[23]$ to $[n]=[37]$ involves two order-preserving maps:\n*   A left adjoint $L: [23] \\to [37]$.\n*   A right adjoint $R: [37] \\to [23]$.\n\nThe conditions for the unit and counit, expressed in terms of the pointwise order, are:\n1.  **Unit**: $\\text{id}_{[23]} \\le R \\circ L$. This means for every $i \\in [23]$, we must have $\\text{id}_{[23]}(i) \\le (R \\circ L)(i)$, which simplifies to $i \\le R(L(i))$.\n2.  **Counit**: $L \\circ R \\le \\text{id}_{[37]}$. This means for every $j \\in [37]$, we must have $(L \\circ R)(j) \\le \\text{id}_{[37]}(j)$, which simplifies to $L(R(j)) \\le j$.\n\nA pair of order-preserving maps $(L, R)$ satisfying these two conditions is also known as a **Galois connection** between the posets $([23], \\le)$ and $([37], \\le)$. These two conditions are equivalent to the single condition: $L(i) \\le j \\iff i \\le R(j)$ for all $i \\in [23]$ and $j \\in [37]$.\n\n**Step 3: Characterize the adjoint maps**\n\nAn adjunction is determined by either the left or the right adjoint.\n*   A map $L: [m] \\to [n]$ is a left adjoint if and only if it preserves all colimits (which in a poset are suprema or joins). A total order like $[m]$ is a complete lattice, so all suprema exist. For $L$ to preserve them, it must preserve the supremum of the empty set. The supremum of the empty set in $[m]$ is the bottom element, 0. Therefore, we must have $L(\\sup(\\emptyset)) = \\sup(L(\\emptyset))$, which implies $L(0)=0$.\n*   A map $R: [n] \\to [m]$ is a right adjoint if and only if it preserves all limits (which in a poset are infima or meets). Similarly, $R$ must preserve the infimum of the empty set. The infimum of the empty set in $[n]$ is the top element, $n$. Therefore, we must have $R(\\inf(\\emptyset)) = \\inf(R(\\emptyset))$, which implies $R(n)=m$.\n\nSo, an adjunction is determined by either an order-preserving map $L: [23] \\to [37]$ satisfying $L(0)=0$, or an order-preserving map $R: [37] \\to [23]$ satisfying $R(37)=23$. There is a one-to-one correspondence between these two types of maps. To find the total number of adjunctions, we can simply count the number of maps of one of these types.\n\n**Step 4: Count the number of valid maps**\n\nLet's count the number of order-preserving maps $L: [23] \\to [37]$ such that $L(0)=0$.\nAn order-preserving map $L$ is defined by the sequence of values $L(0), L(1), \\dots, L(23)$. These values must satisfy:\n$L(0) \\le L(1) \\le \\dots \\le L(23)$, where each $L(i) \\in [37]$.\n\nThe condition $L(0)=0$ fixes the first value. So we have:\n$0 = L(0) \\le L(1) \\le L(2) \\le \\dots \\le L(23) \\le 37$.\n\nWe need to determine the number of possible sequences for $L(1), \\dots, L(23)$. This is a non-decreasing sequence of 23 elements chosen from the set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 37\\}$. This is a classic combinatorial problem that can be solved using \"stars and bars\".\n\nWe are choosing 23 numbers (for $L(1)$ to $L(23)$) from the set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 37\\}$, which has $37+1 = 38$ elements, with replacement, and the order is determined by the non-decreasing condition.\nThe formula for choosing $k$ items from a set of $N$ with replacement is $\\binom{N+k-1}{k}$.\n*   Here, $k=23$ (the number of values to choose).\n*   And $N=38$ (the number of available choices for each value).\n\nThe number of such maps is:\n$\\binom{38 + 23 - 1}{23} = \\binom{60}{23}$.\n\n**Step 5: Verification (Optional)**\n\nWe can also count the number of valid right adjoints $R: [37] \\to [23]$ with $R(37)=23$.\nWe need to find the number of non-decreasing sequences $R(0), R(1), \\dots, R(37)$ satisfying:\n$0 \\le R(0) \\le R(1) \\le \\dots \\le R(37) = 23$.\n\nThis means we must choose the 37 values for $R(0), \\dots, R(36)$ from the set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 23\\}$, which has $23+1 = 24$ elements.\n*   Here, $k=37$.\n*   And $N=24$.\n\nThe number of such maps is:\n$\\binom{24 + 37 - 1}{37} = \\binom{60}{37}$.\n\nUsing the identity $\\binom{n}{k} = \\binom{n}{n-k}$, we can verify that our results are consistent:\n$\\binom{60}{37} = \\binom{60}{60-37} = \\binom{60}{23}$.\n\nThe number of internal adjunctions is therefore $\\binom{60}{23}$.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe final answer is $\\binom{60}{23}$.\n\n<<<Binomial(60, 23)>>>"
