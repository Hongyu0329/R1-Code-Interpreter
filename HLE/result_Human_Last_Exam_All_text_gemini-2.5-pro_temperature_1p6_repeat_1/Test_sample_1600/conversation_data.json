    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the value of a(3).\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem Definition:**\n    *   `a(n)`: This represents a sequence where `n` is an integer index (starting from n=1).\n    *   **\"number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams\"**: In the context of propagator corrections, \"non-vanishing\" is standardly interpreted as connected and one-particle-irreducible (1PI). A 1PI diagram is one that cannot be split into two separate parts by cutting a single internal line. If reducible diagrams were included, there would be an infinite number of them.\n    *   **\"of order 2n\"**: In Quantum Electrodynamics (QED), the order of a diagram is determined by the number of vertices, as each vertex introduces a factor of the coupling constant `e`. An order of `2n` corresponds to `2n` vertices.\n    *   **\"for the electron or the photon propagators\"**: This refers to self-energy diagrams, which are corrections to the propagator of a particle. These diagrams have two external lines (one incoming, one outgoing) of the same typeâ€”either both electron lines or both photon lines.\n    *   **`a(3)`**: We need to find the value of this function for `n=3`.\n\n2.  **Relate `n` to Physical Properties of the Diagrams:**\n    *   The question asks for `a(3)`. According to the definition, this is the number of diagrams of order `2n = 2 * 3 = 6`. So, we are looking for diagrams with 6 vertices.\n    *   In QED, for a self-energy diagram (with 2 external lines), the number of loops (`L`) is related to the number of vertices (`V`) by the formula `L = V/2`.\n    *   Since we have `V = 6` vertices, the diagrams will have `L = 6 / 2 = 3` loops.\n    *   Therefore, `a(3)` is the number of 3-loop, 6-vertex, 1PI self-energy Feynman diagrams in QED.\n\n3.  **Address the \"Electron or Photon\" Clause:**\n    *   The number of 1PI diagrams for the electron self-energy is not always the same as for the photon self-energy (vacuum polarization).\n        *   At **1-loop** (n=1, 2 vertices): The number is 1 for both the electron and the photon. So, `a(1) = 1`.\n        *   At **2-loops** (n=2, 4 vertices): There are 7 diagrams for the electron self-energy, but only 2 for the photon self-energy.\n    *   The phrase \"electron or the photon\" can be slightly ambiguous. However, in the context of enumeration problems in physics, this refers to a well-known sequence. The sequence for the number of electron self-energy diagrams (1, 7, 72, ...) is the standard one cited in literature for this type of problem. The question assumes this canonical sequence.\n\n4.  **Determine the Value of `a(3)`:**\n    *   We need to find the number of 3-loop 1PI electron self-energy diagrams. This is a known result from high-order QED calculations, not something to be derived from scratch without specialized tools.\n    *   We list the first few terms of the sequence `a(n)`, which represents the number of `n`-loop 1PI electron self-energy diagrams:\n        *   `a(1)` (1-loop): 1 diagram.\n        *   `a(2)` (2-loops): 7 diagrams.\n        *   `a(3)` (3-loops): 72 diagrams.\n        *   `a(4)` (4-loops): 891 diagrams.\n    *   This sequence is recorded in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) as A002886.\n\n5.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    *   The question asks for `a(3)`.\n    *   Following the established sequence for the number of diagrams for the electron propagator, the value for n=3 is 72.\n\n**List of Careful Points:**\n*   The \"order\" `2n` refers to `2n` vertices, not `2n` loops.\n*   For self-energy diagrams in QED, `2n` vertices correspond to `n` loops.\n*   \"Non-vanishing\" implies connected and one-particle-irreducible (1PI) diagrams.\n*   The number of diagrams for the electron self-energy and photon self-energy are not the same for `n>1`. The problem refers to the canonical sequence associated with the electron self-energy.\n*   The result is a known, calculated value from theoretical physics and is not trivially derived.\n\nFollowing the step-by-step analysis, the value of a(3) is the third term in the sequence for the number of n-loop electron self-energy diagrams.\n\n<<<72>>>"
