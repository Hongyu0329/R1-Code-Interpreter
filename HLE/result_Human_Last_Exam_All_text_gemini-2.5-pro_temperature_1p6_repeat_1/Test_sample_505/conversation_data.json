    "This problem asks for the maximum number of logical qubits that can be encoded in a system consisting of two separate patches of surface code, into which a total of two holes are introduced.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the baseline encoding of a single surface code patch.**\nA single, standard planar patch of surface code (without any holes) is capable of encoding exactly one logical qubit. This is achieved by defining logical operators that span the patch between its boundaries. Let's denote the number of logical qubits in a patch with $h$ holes as $k(h)$. For a patch with no holes, $h=0$, so $k(0) = 1$.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the effect of adding holes to a surface code patch.**\nWhen a hole is created in a surface code patch, it introduces a new boundary within the code. This new topological feature allows for the definition of an additional logical qubit. The logical operators for this new qubit can be defined, for example, by a string operator that loops around the hole and another string operator that connects the hole's boundary to one of the patch's outer boundaries. Each hole added to a patch increases its qubit capacity by one.\nTherefore, a single patch of surface code with $h$ holes can encode a total of $k(h) = 1 + h$ logical qubits (one from the patch's inherent structure and one for each hole).\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the possible distributions of the two holes across the two patches.**\nWe have two patches (Patch A and Patch B) and a total of two holes to distribute. There are two distinct ways to do this:\n\n*   **Scenario 1: Both holes in one patch.**\n    *   We place both holes in Patch A, so it has $h_A = 2$ holes.\n    *   Patch B is left with no holes, so it has $h_B = 0$ holes.\n\n*   **Scenario 2: One hole in each patch.**\n    *   We place one hole in Patch A, so it has $h_A = 1$ hole.\n    *   We place the other hole in Patch B, so it has $h_B = 1$ hole.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the total number of logical qubits for each scenario.**\nThe total number of logical qubits in the system is the sum of the qubits from each independent patch.\n\n*   **Calculation for Scenario 1:**\n    *   Number of qubits in Patch A: $k_A = k(h_A) = 1 + 2 = 3$ logical qubits.\n    *   Number of qubits in Patch B: $k_B = k(h_B) = 1 + 0 = 1$ logical qubit.\n    *   Total logical qubits = $k_A + k_B = 3 + 1 = 4$.\n\n*   **Calculation for Scenario 2:**\n    *   Number of qubits in Patch A: $k_A = k(h_A) = 1 + 1 = 2$ logical qubits.\n    *   Number of qubits in Patch B: $k_B = k(h_B) = 1 + 1 = 2$ logical qubits.\n    *   Total logical qubits = $k_A + k_B = 2 + 2 = 4$.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the maximum number of logical qubits.**\nBy comparing the results of all possible scenarios, we find that both distributions of the two holes yield a total of 4 logical qubits.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of logical qubits that can be encoded in this configuration is 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
