    "*   **Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Curve and the Base Field:**\n    The curve is given by the equation $C: z^2 = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1$. The base field is the field of 2-adic numbers, $K = \\mathbb{Q}_2$. The valuation is the 2-adic valuation $v$, normalized so that $v(2)=1$. We are looking for the properties of the stable reduction of this curve. The stable reduction is a specific type of model over the ring of 2-adic integers $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ whose special fiber (the reduction modulo 2) consists of a curve with only nodes (double points) as singularities.\n\n2.  **Decomposition of the Base Space:**\n    The curve is a double cover of the projective line $\\mathbb{P}^1_x$, ramified at the roots of the polynomial $f(x) = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1$ and possibly at infinity. The structure of the stable reduction is often understood by analyzing the curve over different regions of $\\mathbb{P}^1_x$. We partition $\\mathbb{P}^1_x(\\mathbb{Q}_2)$ into annuli and disks based on the valuation of $x$:\n    *   The disk $D_1 = \\{x \\in \\mathbb{Q}_2 \\mid v(x) \\ge 1\\}$.\n    *   The annulus $A = \\{x \\in \\mathbb{Q}_2 \\mid v(x) = 0\\}$.\n    *   The disk \"at infinity\" $D_\\infty = \\{x \\in \\mathbb{Q}_2 \\mid v(x) < 0\\} \\cup \\{\\infty\\}$.\n\n3.  **Analysis over the Annulus A (v(x) = 0):**\n    Let's determine if there are any $\\mathbb{Q}_2$-points on the curve for which $v(x) = 0$. For such a point to exist, $f(x) = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1$ must be a square in $\\mathbb{Q}_2$.\n    A number $u \\in \\mathbb{Q}_2$ is a square if and only if its valuation $v(u)$ is an even integer and its unit part $u/2^{v(u)}$ is congruent to $1 \\pmod 8$.\n    If $v(x)=0$, then $x$ is a 2-adic unit, i.e., an odd integer.\n    Let's evaluate $f(x)$ modulo 8:\n    *   $x$ is odd, so $x^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 8$.\n    *   $x^3 = x \\cdot x^2 \\equiv x \\cdot 1 \\equiv x \\pmod 8$.\n    *   $x^5 = x \\cdot (x^2)^2 \\equiv x \\cdot 1^2 \\equiv x \\pmod 8$.\n    *   So, $f(x) = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1 \\equiv 2x + 2x + 1 = 4x + 1 \\pmod 8$.\n    Since $x$ is odd, $x$ can be $1, 3, 5, 7 \\pmod 8$.\n    *   If $x \\equiv 1 \\pmod 8$, $f(x) \\equiv 4(1)+1 = 5 \\pmod 8$.\n    *   If $x \\equiv 3 \\pmod 8$, $f(x) \\equiv 4(3)+1 = 13 \\equiv 5 \\pmod 8$.\n    *   If $x \\equiv 5 \\pmod 8$, $f(x) \\equiv 4(5)+1 = 21 \\equiv 5 \\pmod 8$.\n    *   If $x \\equiv 7 \\pmod 8$, $f(x) \\equiv 4(7)+1 = 29 \\equiv 5 \\pmod 8$.\n    In all cases where $v(x)=0$, we have $f(x) \\equiv 5 \\pmod 8$.\n    Let's check if $f(x)$ can be a square. The valuation $v(f(x))=v(5 \\pmod 8) = 0$, which is even. However, the unit part is $f(x)$ itself, which is congruent to 5, not 1, modulo 8. Therefore, $f(x)$ is not a square in $\\mathbb{Q}_2$.\n    This means the curve $C$ has no $\\mathbb{Q}_2$-rational points in the region where $v(x)=0$.\n\n4.  **Stable Reduction and the Annulus of Bad Reduction:**\n    The fact that there are no points over the annulus $A$ signifies that the curve has bad reduction there. The stable reduction process will \"fill in\" this region by adding a component to the special fiber. This new component, let's call it $C_A$, arises from the stabilization of the double cover $z^2=f(x)$ over $A$.\n\n5.  **Structure of the Inserted Component:**\n    The structure of $C_A$ depends on the nature of the quadratic extension $K(x)(\\sqrt{f(x)})$ over the function field $K(x)$ of the annulus.\n    Over $A$, $v(f(x)) = 0$. Since $f(x)$ is not a square in $\\mathbb{Q}_2$, the quadratic extension is ramified. For a hyperelliptic curve, such a ramified cover over an annulus gives rise to a component in the stable reduction which is a rational curve with a single ordinary double point (a node).\n\n6.  **Calculating the Thickness of the Double Point:**\n    The \"thickness\" of this double point (or node) is a numerical invariant that measures the extent of the degeneration. For a nodal component arising from an equation $z^2 = u$, where $u$ is a 2-adic unit but not a square, the thickness $\\delta$ is given by the valuation of the difference between $u$ and the \"closest\" square unit in $\\mathbb{Z}_2$. The square units in $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ are those congruent to $1 \\pmod 8$.\n    The closest square to $u=f(x)$ is $c^2=1$.\n    The thickness is $\\delta = v(f(x) - 1^2)$.\n    We calculate this valuation for an arbitrary $x$ in the annulus $A$ (where $v(x)=0$):\n    $\\delta = v(f(x)-1) = v((2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1) - 1) = v(2x^5 + 2x^3) = v(2x^3(x^2+1))$.\n    Using the properties of the valuation:\n    $\\delta = v(2) + v(x^3) + v(x^2+1)$.\n    *   $v(2) = 1$.\n    *   Since $v(x)=0$, $v(x^3) = 3 \\cdot v(x) = 0$.\n    *   For $v(x)=0$, $x$ is an odd integer. So $x^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 8$. This means $x^2-1 = 8k$ for some $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}_2$. Thus, $x^2+1 = (x^2-1)+2 = 8k+2$.\n    *   The valuation of $x^2+1$ is $v(8k+2) = v(2(4k+1))$. Since $v(4k+1)=0$, we have $v(x^2+1) = v(2) = 1$.\n    Combining these results:\n    $\\delta = 1 + 0 + 1 = 2$.\n    The thickness of the double point is 2. This value is constant for all $x$ in the annulus $v(x)=0$.\n\n*   **Final careful points:**\n    *   The question assumes a standard definition of \"thickness\". In the context of stable reduction of curves, especially in arithmetic geometry and tropical geometry, this refers to a specific valuation measuring the degeneracy of a node.\n    *   The key insight is to relate the geometry of the stable reduction to the arithmetic properties of the defining polynomial over different regions of the base space.\n    *   The non-existence of points over the annulus $v(x)=0$ is the crucial arithmetic fact that forces the creation of a singular component in the stable reduction.\n    *   The calculation of $v(x^2+1)=1$ for any 2-adic unit $x$ is a common and important trick in 2-adic analysis.\n\n*   **Final Answer Derivation:**\n    The curve is $z^2 = f(x) = 2x^5+2x^3+1$. Over the annulus $A=\\{x | v(x)=0\\}$, the polynomial $f(x)$ takes values that are always congruent to $5 \\pmod 8$. These values are not squares in $\\mathbb{Q}_2$. This causes the stable reduction to have a component with a double point corresponding to this annulus. The thickness of this double point is $\\delta = v(f(x)-c^2)$ where $c^2$ is the closest square. We choose $c=1$.\n    $\\delta = v(f(x)-1) = v(2x^5+2x^3) = v(2x^3(x^2+1))$.\n    Since $v(x)=0$, this simplifies to $\\delta = v(2) + 3v(x) + v(x^2+1) = 1+0+v(x^2+1)$.\n    For a 2-adic unit $x$, $x^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 8$, so $x^2+1 \\equiv 2 \\pmod 8$. Therefore, $v(x^2+1)=1$.\n    The thickness is $\\delta = 1+1=2$.\n\n<<<2>>>"
