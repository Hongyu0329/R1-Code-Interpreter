    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct unit.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    The question asks for a specific unit in the game \"Beyond All Reason\" (BAR) with the following attributes:\n    *   **Type:** Flying unit\n    *   **Origin:** Built from a Tier 1 (T1) building\n    *   **Capability 1:** Can shoot (i.e., has a weapon)\n    *   **Capability 2:** The weapon stuns enemy targets\n\n2.  **Identify Relevant Factions and Buildings:**\n    BAR has two primary factions: Armada (ARM) and Cortex (CORT). Flying units are produced from the Air Plant. The question specifies a T1 building, so we need to examine the units available from the T1 Air Plant for both factions.\n\n3.  **Examine Armada (ARM) T1 Air Units:**\n    The Armada T1 Air Plant can produce several flying units:\n    *   **Peeper (Fighter):** An air-to-air fighter. It shoots lasers but does not have a stun ability.\n    *   **Thunder (Bomber):** An air-to-ground bomber. It drops bombs which cause area damage but do not stun.\n    *   **Slasher (Gunship):** A standard gunship with a fast-firing machine gun. It is effective against light units but does not stun.\n    *   **Wasp (EMP Gunship):** A specialized gunship. It shoots EMP (Electro-Magnetic Pulse) rockets. These rockets deal light damage and, most importantly, **stun** enemy units they hit for a short duration, disabling their movement and attacks.\n    *   **Hawk (Scout):** A fast scout plane with a very weak laser for vision purposes. It does not stun.\n    *   **Pelican (Transport):** An unarmed unit for transporting other units.\n\n4.  **Examine Cortex (CORT) T1 Air Units:**\n    The Cortex T1 Air Plant can also produce several flying units:\n    *   **Vampire (Fighter):** An air-to-air fighter that fires rockets. It does not have a stun ability.\n    *   **Shadow (Bomber):** An air-to-ground bomber. It drops bombs but does not stun.\n    *   **Thrasher (Gunship):** A standard gunship that fires unguided rockets. It deals area damage but does not stun.\n    *   **Fly (Scout):** A fast scout drone with a weak laser. It does not stun.\n    *   **Albatross (Transport):** An unarmed transport unit.\n\n5.  **Conclusion from Analysis:**\n    By reviewing the T1 flying units for both factions, we can identify the unit that meets all the criteria. The Cortex faction does not have a T1 flying unit that can stun. The Armada faction, however, has the **Wasp**. The Wasp is a flying unit, is built from the T1 Air Plant, shoots EMP rockets, and its primary function is to stun enemy targets.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **\"Stun\" Definition:** In BAR, \"stun\" is a specific status effect, usually caused by EMP weapons, that completely immobilizes a unit and stops it from firing. This is distinct from the knockback or staggering effect of heavy explosions.\n*   **Unit Specialization:** It's important to remember that many units in BAR are highly specialized. While standard gunships like the Slasher and Thrasher are for direct damage, the Wasp is a utility unit designed for control via its stun ability.\n*   **Faction Asymmetry:** Armada and Cortex are not mirror factions. They have unique units with different capabilities. The existence of a T1 EMP gunship for Armada (Wasp) without a direct equivalent for Cortex is a prime example of this asymmetry.\n\nThe final answer is the Armada T1 EMP Gunship.\n\n<<<Wasp>>>"
