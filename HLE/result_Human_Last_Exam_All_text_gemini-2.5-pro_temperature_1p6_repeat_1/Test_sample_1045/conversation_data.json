    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of contracted Gaussian functions for toluene (C7H8) using a 6-31G basis set.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Molecule\nFirst, we need to determine the chemical formula and the number of atoms of each element in toluene.\n*   **Molecule:** Toluene\n*   **Chemical Formula:** C₇H₈\n*   This means the molecule consists of:\n    *   7 Carbon (C) atoms\n    *   8 Hydrogen (H) atoms\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the 6-31G Basis Set\nThe notation \"6-31G\" describes how atomic orbitals are constructed from primitive Gaussian functions. We need to interpret this notation for each type of atom in the molecule (Carbon and Hydrogen). A \"contracted Gaussian function\" is another term for a basis function.\n\n**For a Carbon (C) atom (a second-row element):**\n*   **`6-`**: This part describes the core atomic orbital(s). Carbon's core orbital is the 1s orbital. It is represented by a **single contracted Gaussian function (CGF)** which is a linear combination of 6 primitive Gaussian functions.\n    *   Core functions: **1 CGF**\n*   **`-31`**: This part describes the valence atomic orbitals (2s and 2p for Carbon). The valence shell is \"split\" into two parts, an inner and an outer part.\n    *   **Inner Valence (`3`):** The inner part is described by one set of CGFs, each constructed from 3 primitive Gaussians. This includes one s-type orbital (2s) and three p-type orbitals (2px, 2py, 2pz).\n        *   Inner valence functions: 1 (s-type) + 3 (p-type) = **4 CGFs**\n    *   **Outer Valence (`1`):** The outer part is described by a second set of CGFs, each constructed from 1 primitive Gaussian (i.e., they are uncontracted). This also includes one s-type orbital and three p-type orbitals.\n        *   Outer valence functions: 1 (s-type) + 3 (p-type) = **4 CGFs**\n*   **Total for one Carbon atom:** 1 (core) + 4 (inner valence) + 4 (outer valence) = **9 CGFs**.\n\n**For a Hydrogen (H) atom (a first-row element):**\n*   Hydrogen has no core electrons, only a 1s valence orbital. The `6-` part of the notation does not apply.\n*   **`-31`**: This describes how the 1s valence orbital is split.\n    *   **Inner Valence (`3`):** The inner part of the 1s orbital is represented by **1 CGF** made from 3 primitive Gaussians.\n    *   **Outer Valence (`1`):** The outer part of the 1s orbital is represented by **1 CGF** made from 1 primitive Gaussian.\n*   **Total for one Hydrogen atom:** 1 (inner) + 1 (outer) = **2 CGFs**.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Total Number of Contracted Functions for Toluene (C₇H₈)\nNow we combine the information from the first two steps to find the total for the entire molecule.\n*   **Contribution from Carbon atoms:**\n    *   Number of C atoms = 7\n    *   CGFs per C atom = 9\n    *   Total from C = 7 × 9 = **63 CGFs**\n*   **Contribution from Hydrogen atoms:**\n    *   Number of H atoms = 8\n    *   CGFs per H atom = 2\n    *   Total from H = 8 × 2 = **16 CGFs**\n*   **Total for the molecule:**\n    *   Total CGFs = (Total from C) + (Total from H)\n    *   Total CGFs = 63 + 16 = **79**\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n1.  **Correct Atom Count:** Ensure you have the correct number of atoms for the molecule (C₇H₈).\n2.  **Distinguish Core vs. Valence:** The Pople basis set notation (X-YZG) treats core and valence electrons differently.\n3.  **Split Valence:** The \"YZ\" part means the valence shell is described by two basis functions per atomic orbital (e.g., 2s is described by two s-type basis functions, 2p is described by two sets of p-type basis functions).\n4.  **Count All Orbitals:** For second-row elements like Carbon, the valence shell includes both s and p orbitals. A common mistake is to forget the p-orbitals.\n5.  **Contracted vs. Primitive:** The question asks for the number of *contracted* Gaussian functions (basis functions), not the total number of *primitive* Gaussians.\n\nThe final answer is the total number of contracted Gaussian functions used in the calculation.\n\n<<<79>>>"
