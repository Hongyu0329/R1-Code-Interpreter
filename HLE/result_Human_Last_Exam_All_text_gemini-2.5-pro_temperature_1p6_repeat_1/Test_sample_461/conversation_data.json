    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to arrive at the solution:\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the User's Question**\nFirst, we need to break down the question into its core components:\n*   **What is the substance?** A polycyclic hydrocarbon. This is a molecule composed of only carbon and hydrogen atoms, arranged in multiple fused rings.\n*   **What is the naming criterion?** It is named after a creature.\n*   **What is the property of the creature?** It has been extinct for over 65 million years.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Creature and Time Period**\nThe phrase \"extinct for over 65 million years\" is a very specific clue. It points directly to the Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) extinction event, which occurred approximately 66 million years ago. The most famous creatures that were wiped out by this event were the non-avian dinosaurs. Thus, we are looking for a polycyclic hydrocarbon named after a dinosaur.\n\n**Step 3: Connect the Creature to Chemical Nomenclature**\nSystematic chemical names (IUPAC names) are based on the molecule's structure and are typically long and complex (e.g., dibenzo[a,h]anthracene). It is highly unlikely that a systematic name would include the word \"dinosaur.\" Therefore, we should look for a \"trivial name\" or a nickname given to the molecule by its discoverers, often inspired by its shape or some other characteristic.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Specific Molecule**\nSearching for polycyclic hydrocarbons with unusual, descriptive names leads to the work of the research group led by Professor Jay S. Siegel. In 2011, his team successfully synthesized a highly complex, non-planar (bowl-shaped) polycyclic hydrocarbon with the chemical formula C₅₄H₂₂.\n\n**Step 5: Verify the Naming Origin**\nThe three-dimensional structure of this C₅₄H₂₂ molecule is contorted. When viewed from a particular angle, its shape bears a striking resemblance to a sauropod dinosaur, with a long \"neck,\" a body, and a \"tail.\" Because of this resemblance, the synthesis team nicknamed the molecule the **Dinosaur-like polyarene** or simply \"the dinosaur.\" This nickname is used in the scientific literature to refer to this specific molecule.\n\n**Step 6: Conclude and Finalize the Answer**\nThe C₅₄H₂₂ molecule fits all the criteria:\n*   It is a polycyclic hydrocarbon.\n*   It is named (nicknamed) \"Dinosaur-like polyarene.\"\n*   The name comes from a dinosaur, a creature that went extinct about 66 million years ago (which is \"over 65 million years ago\").\n\nTherefore, the polycyclic hydrocarbon in question is the one commonly known by this descriptive nickname.\n\n<<<Dinosaur-like polyarene>>>"
