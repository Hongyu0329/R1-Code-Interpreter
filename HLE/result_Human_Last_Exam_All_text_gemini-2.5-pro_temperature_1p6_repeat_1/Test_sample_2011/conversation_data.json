    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstructing the Question\n\nFirst, let's understand the key terms used in the question:\n\n*   **Graph on n = 128 vertices:** We are dealing with a graph `G` that has a set of 128 vertices, `V`, and some set of edges, `E`, connecting pairs of these vertices.\n*   **Induced Subgraph:** For any subset of vertices `S` from `V`, the induced subgraph `G[S]` consists of the vertices `S` and *all* edges from `E` that have both endpoints in `S`.\n*   **Clique:** A clique is a subset of vertices where every two distinct vertices are connected by an edge. A clique of size `k` is equivalent to an induced subgraph that is a complete graph on `k` vertices, denoted `K_k`.\n*   **Different Clique Sizes:** This refers to the size `k` (the number of vertices) of a clique. We are interested in the set of all possible integers `k` for which the graph `G` contains an induced `K_k`.\n*   **Simultaneously Appear:** This means we are looking for a single graph `G` that contains induced cliques of various sizes all at once.\n*   **Maximum Possible Number:** We need to find the graph `G` on 128 vertices that maximizes the count of these different clique sizes.\n\n### Step 2: Formulating the Problem\n\nLet `G` be a graph with `|V(G)| = 128`. We are interested in the set `S(G)` defined as:\n`S(G) = { k | k is a positive integer and there exists a subset of vertices V' ⊆ V(G) with |V'| = k such that G[V'] is a clique (a K_k) }`\n\nThe problem asks for the maximum possible value of `|S(G)|` (the number of elements in the set `S(G)`), considering all possible graphs `G` on 128 vertices.\n\n### Step 3: Identifying the Core Property of Clique Sizes\n\nThere is a fundamental relationship between the different clique sizes that can exist in a graph.\n\n**Key Insight:** If a graph `G` contains an induced clique of size `k` (where `k > 1`), it must also contain an induced clique of size `k-1`.\n\n**Proof:**\n1.  Assume `G` has an induced clique of size `k`. This means there is a set of vertices `V_k` with `|V_k| = k` such that every pair of vertices in `V_k` is connected by an edge.\n2.  Since `k > 1`, `V_k` is not empty. We can choose any vertex `v` from `V_k` and form a new set `V_{k-1} = V_k \\ {v}`.\n3.  The new set `V_{k-1}` has `k-1` vertices.\n4.  Since every pair of vertices in `V_k` was connected, it follows that every pair of vertices in the subset `V_{k-1}` is also connected.\n5.  Therefore, the subgraph induced by `V_{k-1}`, which is `G[V_{k-1}]`, is a complete graph of size `k-1`, i.e., a `K_{k-1}`.\n\nThis proves that if `k` is a possible clique size in `G` (`k ∈ S(G)`), then all smaller positive integer sizes `1, 2, ..., k-1` are also possible clique sizes in `G` (`{1, 2, ..., k-1} ⊆ S(G)`).\n\n### Step 4: Simplifying the Problem\n\nFrom the property identified in Step 3, the set of all possible clique sizes `S(G)` for any graph `G` must be an unbroken sequence of integers starting from 1. That is, if the largest possible clique size in `G` is `k_max`, then the set of all clique sizes is:\n`S(G) = {1, 2, 3, ..., k_max}`.\n\nThe number of different clique sizes is `|S(G)| = k_max`.\nThe value `k_max` is simply the size of the largest clique in the graph `G`, which is a standard graph parameter known as the **clique number**, denoted `ω(G)`.\n\nSo, the original problem simplifies to:\n**What is the maximum possible clique number `ω(G)` for a graph `G` with 128 vertices?**\n\n### Step 5: Solving the Simplified Problem\n\nWe want to find `max_{G: |V(G)|=128} ω(G)`.\n\n1.  **Upper Bound:** For any graph `G` on `n` vertices, a clique is a subset of these vertices. Therefore, the size of any clique cannot be greater than the total number of vertices. For `n = 128`, we have `ω(G) ≤ 128`.\n2.  **Achieving the Bound:** We need to show that there exists a graph `G` on 128 vertices for which `ω(G) = 128`. Consider the **complete graph** `K_128`. This is the graph on 128 vertices where every vertex is connected to every other vertex.\n3.  In `K_128`, the set of all 128 vertices itself forms a clique. Therefore, the clique number of `K_128` is `ω(K_128) = 128`.\n\n### Step 6: Final Conclusion\n\nSince the number of different clique sizes is equal to the clique number `ω(G)`, and we have found that the maximum possible value for `ω(G)` on a graph with 128 vertices is 128, the maximum possible number of different clique sizes is also 128.\n\nThis maximum is achieved by the complete graph `K_128`, which contains induced cliques of every size from 1 to 128.\n\n---\n#### A Note on a Potential Misinterpretation\n\nOne might wonder if the induced cliques for different sizes must be formed on **disjoint** sets of vertices. The problem statement does not include this constraint. If it did, the problem would be to find the maximum `m` such that `1 + 2 + 3 + ... + m ≤ 128`. This gives `m(m+1)/2 ≤ 128`, which solves to `m=15`. However, since the problem does not state this disjointness constraint, we should not assume it. The standard interpretation allows the vertex sets of the induced subgraphs to overlap.\n\n---\nThe step-by-step analysis leads to the final answer.\n\n<<<128>>>"
