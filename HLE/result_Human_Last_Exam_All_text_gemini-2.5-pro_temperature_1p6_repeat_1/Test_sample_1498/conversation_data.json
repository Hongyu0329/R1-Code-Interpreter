    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Core Question:** The request is to identify the specific range of verses (*abyāt* or *bayts*) in the poem 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam' where the names of the 25 Prophets of Islam (as per the standard Sunni creed) are listed.\n\n2.  **Context of the Poem:** 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam' (The Creed of the Laymen) by Sayyid Ahmad al-Marzuqi is a famous pedagogical poem that outlines the fundamentals of Islamic belief (Aqeedah) according to the Ash'ari school. A key component of this creed is the belief in all the prophets, with a specific obligation to know the 25 whose names are mentioned in the Qur'an.\n\n3.  **Locating the Relevant Section:** The poem is structured logically. It first discusses the attributes of Allah, then moves on to the attributes of the Prophets. Immediately following the discussion of the Prophets' four necessary attributes (truthfulness, trustworthiness, conveying the message, and intelligence), the poem lists their names.\n\n4.  **Identifying the Introductory Verse:** Before the list begins, there is a verse that sets the stage and states the obligation. This is **Bayt 27**:\n    > تفصيلُ خَمْسَةٍ وَعِشْرِينَ لَزِمْ *** كُلَّ مُكَلَّفٍ فَحَقِّقْ وَاغْتَنِمْ\n    > *Tafsīlu khamsatin wa ‘ishrīna lazim*\n    > *Kulla mukallafin faḥaqqiq waghtanim*\n    > (The details of twenty-five [prophets] are binding upon every legally responsible person, so verify and benefit.)\n    *Careful Point:* This verse *introduces* the topic but does not contain any of the prophets' names itself. The question asks from which bayt the names are *mentioned*. Therefore, the list starts in the verse immediately following this one.\n\n5.  **Identifying the Starting Verse of the List:** The very next verse, **Bayt 28**, begins the enumeration of the prophets' names.\n    > هُمْ آدَمٌ اِدْرِيسٌ نُوحٌ هُودٌ مَعْ *** صَالِحْ وَإِبْرَاهِيمُ كُلٌّ مُتَّبَعْ\n    > *Hum Ādamun Idrīsu Nūhun Hūdun maʿ*\n    > *Ṣāliḥ wa Ibrāhīmu kullun muttabaʿ*\n    > (They are: Adam, Idris, Nuh, Hud along with Salih and Ibrahim, each is to be followed.)\n    This is the first verse where the names appear.\n\n6.  **Tracing the List Through to its End:** We must continue through the subsequent verses until the last prophet's name is mentioned.\n    *   **Bayt 29:** Lists Lut, Isma'il, Ishaq, Ya'qub, Yusuf, and Ayyub.\n        > لُوطٌ وَإِسْمَاعِيلُ إِسْحَاقٌ كَذَا *** يَعْقُوبُ يُوسُفُ وَأَيُّوبُ احْتَذَى\n    *   **Bayt 30:** Lists Shu'ayb, Harun, Musa, al-Yasa', Dhu 'l-Kifl, Dawud, and Sulayman.\n        > شُعَيْبٌ هَارُونُ وَمُوسَى وَالْيَسَعْ *** ذُو الْكِفْلِ دَاوُدُ سُلَيْمَانُ اتَّبَعْ\n    *   **Bayt 31:** Lists Ilyas, Yunus, Zakariyya, Yahya, 'Isa, and concludes with Prophet Muhammad ﷺ.\n        > إِلْيَاسُ يُونُسُ زَكَرِيَّا يَحْيَى *** عِيسَى وَطَهَ خَاتِمٌ دَعْ غَيَّا\n        > *Ilyāsu Yūnusu Zakariyyā Yaḥyā*\n        > *ʿĪsā wa Ṭāhā khātimun daʿ ghayyā*\n        > (Ilyas, Yunus, Zakariyya, Yahya, 'Isa, and Taha [Prophet Muhammad], the Seal [of prophets]; leave misguidance.)\n\n7.  **Identifying the Final Verse of the List:** **Bayt 31** is the final verse containing the names of the prophets. The last name mentioned is \"Taha\" (طه), a title for Prophet Muhammad ﷺ. The verse after this (Bayt 32) moves on to discuss the angels.\n\n8.  **Final Conclusion:** The names of the prophets are explicitly listed starting from Bayt 28 and ending in Bayt 31.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n1.  **Verse Numbering:** While the sequence of verses is standard, the exact numbering (e.g., 28 to 31) can vary by one or two numbers in different editions or manuscripts of the poem, depending on how the introductory lines (*bismillah*, praises, etc.) are counted. However, the content and order of the verses containing the names are consistent.\n2.  **Introductory vs. Listing Verses:** It is crucial to distinguish between Bayt 27, which states the *obligation* to know the names, and Bayts 28-31, which actually *list* the names. The question specifically asks for where the names are mentioned.\n3.  **Name for Prophet Muhammad ﷺ:** The poem uses the honorific title \"Taha\" (طه), which is the name of the 20th chapter of the Qur'an, to refer to Prophet Muhammad ﷺ. This is a common practice in classical Islamic poetry.\n4.  **Purpose of the List:** The list covers the 25 prophets mentioned by name in the Qur'an, whose knowledge is considered an individual obligation (*fard 'ayn*) in the Ash'ari school of creed which this poem summarizes.\n\n***\n\n### Final Answer\nThe names of the Prophets in the poem 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam' are mentioned from **Bayt 28 to Bayt 31**.\n\n<<<From Bayt 28 to Bayt 31>>>"
