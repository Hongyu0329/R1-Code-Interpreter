    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rank of the torsion subgroup of the integral cohomology ring of the space of 3-subspaces of $\\mathbb{R}^5$.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Space and the Mathematical Object**\n\nThe \"space of 3-subspaces of $\\mathbb{R}^5$\" is the real Grassmannian manifold, denoted as $G_3(\\mathbb{R}^5)$ or $Gr(3, 5)$. This is a compact, smooth manifold of dimension $k(n-k) = 3(5-3) = 6$.\n\nWe are asked to analyze its integral cohomology ring, $H^*(Gr(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z})$, which is the direct sum of its cohomology groups $H^i(Gr(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z})$. Specifically, we need to find the rank of its torsion subgroup.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Additive Structure of the Integral Cohomology Groups**\n\nThe integral cohomology of real Grassmannians is a classical result in algebraic topology. It is known to contain only 2-torsion. The additive structure of the integral cohomology groups for $Gr(3, 5)$ has been computed and is available in the literature (e.g., in papers by A. Borel, E. H. Brown, F. P. Lam, S. Metoki). We will use this established structure and provide some justification.\n\n*   **$H^0(Gr(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z})$**: Since $Gr(3, 5)$ is a connected space, $H^0(Gr(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$. This group is torsion-free.\n\n*   **$H^1(Gr(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z})$**: The first fundamental group is $\\pi_1(Gr(3, 5)) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2$. The first homology group is the abelianization of $\\pi_1$, so $H_1(Gr(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2$. By the Universal Coefficient Theorem (UCT) for cohomology, $H^1(X; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\text{Hom}(H_1(X; \\mathbb{Z}), \\mathbb{Z})$. Thus, $H^1(Gr(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\text{Hom}(\\mathbb{Z}_2, \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$. This group is torsion-free.\n\n*   **$H^6(Gr(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z})$**: The manifold $Gr(k, n)$ is orientable if and only if $n$ is even. For $Gr(3, 5)$, $n=5$ is odd, so it is a non-orientable manifold. For a compact, connected, non-orientable $d$-manifold, the top integral cohomology group is $H^d(M; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2$. Here, the dimension $d=6$, so $H^6(Gr(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2$. This group is pure torsion.\n\n*   **Other Cohomology Groups**: For the remaining groups, we refer to the established results. The complete additive structure is:\n    *   $H^0(Gr(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$\n    *   $H^1(Gr(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$\n    *   $H^2(Gr(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2$\n    *   $H^3(Gr(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2$\n    *   $H^4(Gr(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2$\n    *   $H^5(Gr(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$\n    *   $H^6(Gr(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2$\n    *   $H^i(Gr(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$ for $i > 6$.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Torsion Subgroup**\n\nThe cohomology ring is the direct sum of these groups: $H^*(Gr(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z}) = \\bigoplus_{i=0}^6 H^i(Gr(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z})$.\nThe torsion subgroup of this ring, let's call it $T$, is the direct sum of the torsion parts of each of the component groups. Let $T_i = \\text{Tors}(H^i(Gr(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z}))$.\n\n*   $T_0 = 0$\n*   $T_1 = 0$\n*   $T_2 = \\mathbb{Z}_2$\n*   $T_3 = \\mathbb{Z}_2$\n*   $T_4 = \\mathbb{Z}_2$ (from the decomposition $\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2$)\n*   $T_5 = 0$\n*   $T_6 = \\mathbb{Z}_2$\n\nThe total torsion subgroup is $T = T_0 \\oplus T_1 \\oplus T_2 \\oplus T_3 \\oplus T_4 \\oplus T_5 \\oplus T_6$.\nSubstituting the groups we found:\n$T = 0 \\oplus 0 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus 0 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2$\n$T \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\cong (\\mathbb{Z}_2)^4$.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Rank of the Torsion Subgroup**\n\nThe question asks for the \"rank\" of the torsion subgroup $T \\cong (\\mathbb{Z}_2)^4$.\nIn the context of finitely generated abelian groups (or $\\mathbb{Z}$-modules), the \"rank\" is the number of $\\mathbb{Z}$ summands in its decomposition, which is 0 for any finite (torsion) group. This interpretation would make the question trivial.\n\nA more common interpretation of \"rank\" for a finite abelian group is the minimum number of generators. For a finite abelian $p$-group (a group where every element has order a power of a prime $p$), this number is called the $p$-rank.\nThe group $T \\cong (\\mathbb{Z}_2)^4$ is a 2-group. It is a vector space of dimension 4 over the field $\\mathbb{Z}_2$. The minimum number of elements required to generate this group is 4.\n\nTherefore, the rank of the torsion subgroup is 4. This corresponds to the number of non-trivial torsion components in the graded cohomology ring.\n\n**Final Answer Summary**\n\n1.  The space is the Grassmannian $Gr(3, 5)$.\n2.  The integral cohomology groups $H^i(Gr(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z})$ are computed or recalled.\n3.  The torsion parts are identified for each degree $i$: a $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ factor in degrees 2, 3, 4, and 6.\n4.  The total torsion subgroup is $T \\cong (\\mathbb{Z}_2)^4$.\n5.  The rank of this group (interpreted as the minimum number of generators) is 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
