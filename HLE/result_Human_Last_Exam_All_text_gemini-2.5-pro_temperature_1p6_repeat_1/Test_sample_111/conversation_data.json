    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the key event and its date.**\nThe question asks for Geoffrey Chaucer's location at the time of Blanche of Lancaster's death. The first step is to establish when Blanche died. Historical records confirm that Blanche of Lancaster, the first wife of John of Gaunt, died of the plague on **September 12, 1368**.\n\n**Step 2: Research Geoffrey Chaucer's recorded movements around September 1368.**\nTo answer the question, we need to consult biographical records of Chaucer's life, specifically his travels and duties as a courtier and diplomat for King Edward III.\n\n*   **May 1368:** Royal records, specifically the *Issue Rolls*, show that Chaucer was issued a license on May 20, 1368, to travel from Dover to the continent on the King's service.\n*   **June 1368:** This mission took him to Milan, Italy. He was part of the entourage of Lionel of Antwerp, Duke of Clarence (King Edward III's son), for the Duke's wedding to Violante Visconti. The wedding took place in Milan in June 1368.\n*   **Summer/Autumn 1368:** Chaucer's service on this mission continued through the summer and into the autumn. While the exact date of his return to England is not recorded, he was certainly abroad for an extended period. The Duke of Clarence himself fell ill and died in Italy in October 1368.\n\n**Step 3: Conclude Chaucer's location based on the timeline.**\nBlanche of Lancaster died on September 12, 1368. At this time, Chaucer was documented as being on a diplomatic mission that had taken him to Milan, Italy. Given that his mission extended into the autumn, it is almost certain that he was still on the continent, either in Italy or traveling back from his post there.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n*   **Date Confirmation:** It is crucial to use the correct year of death, 1368. Some older sources occasionally used 1369, which could lead to an incorrect conclusion, but 1368 is the accepted date.\n*   **Location Specificity:** While we cannot pinpoint Chaucer's exact location on that specific day, his mission's destination and primary location was Italy. He might have been traveling through France on his return journey, but the purpose and center of his activity abroad was Italy. Among the given choices, Italy is the most accurate and specific answer based on historical evidence.\n*   **Source of Information:** The knowledge of Chaucer's travels comes from surviving administrative and financial records of the English royal court, which are the primary sources for his biography.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the Answer Choices.**\n*   A. **Italy:** This aligns perfectly with the known records of Chaucer's diplomatic mission in the summer and autumn of 1368.\n*   B. **France:** Possible as a country he traveled through, but his main destination was Italy.\n*   C. **England:** Incorrect. He was on a mission abroad from May until the autumn of 1368.\n*   D. **Unknown:** While his precise GPS coordinate is unknown, his general location (on a mission to Italy) is well-documented. \"Italy\" is a much more specific and accurate answer than \"Unknown\".\n*   E. **Scotland:** Incorrect. There are no records of him traveling to Scotland at this time.\n\nBased on the analysis, Chaucer was on a diplomatic mission in Italy when Blanche of Lancaster died.\n\n<<<A>>>"
