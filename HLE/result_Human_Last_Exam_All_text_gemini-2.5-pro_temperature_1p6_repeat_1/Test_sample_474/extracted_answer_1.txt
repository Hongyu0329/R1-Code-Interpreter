The approach is not valid. The ecological function of mimicry is determined by the perception of natural predators (e.g., birds), not humans. The human visual system is fundamentally different from that of key predators like birds, particularly in its inability to perceive ultraviolet (UV) light, which is a crucial component of many insect color patterns. Therefore, species that appear similar to humans may appear very different to a predator, and vice versa. Using untrained humans to rate similarity from static images fails to account for the correct signal receiver (the predator), the full spectrum of visual cues (like UV), and dynamic behavioral aspects of mimicry, making the methodology ecologically invalid for clustering species by functional mimicry syndromes.
