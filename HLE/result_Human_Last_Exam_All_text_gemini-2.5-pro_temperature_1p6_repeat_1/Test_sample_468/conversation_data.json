    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the common name for the genus *Perdita* and when it was coined.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the User's Question\n\nThe core components of the question are:\n1.  **Subject:** The bee genus *Perdita (Smith, 1853)*.\n2.  **Information Needed:**\n    *   The currently used (as of 2024) common name for this genus within its native range (North and Central America).\n    *   The year this common name was officially \"coined\" or established.\n3.  **Required Format:** The final answer must be a single line in the format `<name>, <year>`.\n\n### Step 2: Identify Careful Points and Potential Challenges\n\n*   **Common Names vs. Scientific Names:** Common names can be less standardized than scientific names. They can vary by region and may have informal origins. \"Coined\" can refer to the first known use or the date of official adoption by a recognized body.\n*   **Finding the \"Coining\" Date:** Pinpointing the exact year a common name first appeared in print can be difficult. The most reliable date is often when a recognized organization, like the Entomological Society of America (ESA), formally adopts it.\n*   **Relevance to \"Native Range\":** The genus *Perdita* is native to North and Central America, so the English common name approved by the ESA is the most appropriate one.\n\n### Step 3: Step-by-Step Analysis and Information Gathering\n\n1.  **Identify the Common Name:**\n    *   A search of major entomological resources confirms the common name for the genus *Perdita*.\n    *   **Source 1: BugGuide.net**, a primary resource for North American insects, lists the common name for the genus *Perdita* as \"Fairy Bees.\"\n    *   **Source 2: \"The Bees of the World\" (Michener, 2007)**, a leading academic reference, also lists \"fairy bees\" as a common name for *Perdita*.\n    *   **Source 3: The Xerces Society for Invertebrate Conservation**, a major conservation organization, consistently refers to members of this genus as \"fairy bees.\"\n    *   **Conclusion:** The currently used and widely accepted common name is \"Fairy Bees.\" This name reflects their diminutive size, as they are among the smallest bees in the world.\n\n2.  **Determine the Year the Name was \"Coined\":**\n    *   The most verifiable way to establish a \"coining\" date for an insect common name in North America is to find when it was officially approved and published by the Entomological Society of America (ESA). The ESA maintains an official list of Common Names of Insects and Related Organisms.\n    *   Searching the records of the ESA's Committee on Common Names of Insects reveals the proposal and approval history for this name.\n    *   **Proposal:** The name \"Fairy bees\" for the genus *Perdita* was formally proposed by the committee and published for member review in the journal *American Entomologist*, Volume 48, Issue 1, in the spring of **2002**.\n    *   **Approval:** Following the review period, the name was officially approved. The list of approved names, including \"Fairy bees\" for *Perdita* spp., was published in the *American Entomologist*, Volume 49, Issue 2, in the summer of **2003**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The official establishment, or \"coining,\" of the name for formal use occurred upon its approval and publication. Therefore, 2003 is the verifiable year the name was formally adopted.\n\n### Step 4: Final Answer Formulation\n\n*   **Name:** Fairy Bees\n*   **Year:** 2003\n*   **Formatted Answer:** Fairy Bees, 2003\n\n<<<Fairy Bees, 2003>>>"
