    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction between butadiene and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the reactants and their roles.**\n*   **Reactant 1:** Butadiene (specifically 1,3-butadiene). Its structure is CH2=CH-CH=CH2. It has a conjugated system of two double bonds, which contains 4 π-electrons. This makes it a classic **diene** for the Diels-Alder reaction.\n*   **Reactant 2:** 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene. Its structure is CCl2=CF2. It has one double bond containing 2 π-electrons. The highly electronegative halogen atoms (Cl and F) withdraw electron density from the double bond, making it electron-poor. This makes it an excellent **dienophile**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the type of reaction.**\n*   The reaction between a conjugated diene (4π electron system) and a dienophile (2π electron system) to form a six-membered ring is a **Diels-Alder reaction**. This is a type of [4+2] cycloaddition reaction, which is a concerted pericyclic reaction.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the mechanism and predict the product's connectivity.**\n*   In a Diels-Alder reaction, the diene must adopt an *s-cis* conformation to react.\n*   Three pairs of electrons move in a cyclic fashion in a single step:\n    1.  The two π-electrons from one double bond of the diene form a new single (sigma) bond with one carbon of the dienophile.\n    2.  The two π-electrons of the dienophile form a new single (sigma) bond with the other end of the diene system.\n    3.  The two π-electrons from the other double bond of the diene move to form a new double bond in the center of the original diene system.\n*   This process results in the formation of a new six-membered ring containing one double bond.\n\n**Step 4: Draw the reaction and determine the final structure.**\n*   Let's number the carbons of the reactants:\n    *   1,3-Butadiene: C¹H₂=C²H-C³H=C⁴H₂\n    *   1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene: CᵃCl₂=CᵇF₂\n*   The new sigma bonds will form between C¹ and one of the dienophile carbons (e.g., Cᵇ), and between C⁴ and the other dienophile carbon (Cᵃ).\n*   A new double bond will form between C² and C³.\n*   The original double bond in the dienophile (Cᵃ=Cᵇ) becomes a single bond.\n\nThe resulting six-membered ring will be composed of the atoms: -C¹H₂-C²H=C³H-C⁴H₂-CᵃCl₂-CᵇF₂- and a bond between C¹ and Cᵇ to close the ring.\n\nLet's visualize the product structure:\n```\n      H₂C¹ — CH²\n          //\n   CᵇF₂     CH³\n   |        |\n   CᵃCl₂ — CH₂⁴\n```\nThis is a cyclohexene ring. Let's draw it in a more standard way:\n```\n        H₂C — CH\n           //   \\\n        H₂C     CH\n        |       |\n      Cl₂C --- CF₂\n```\nThis structure is a cyclohexene derivative. The substituents are two chlorine atoms on one carbon and two fluorine atoms on the adjacent carbon.\n\n**Step 5: Name the product.**\n*   To name the product using IUPAC nomenclature, we number the ring to give the double bond the lowest possible numbers (1 and 2).\n*   Then, we number the rest of the ring to give the substituents the lowest possible locants.\n*   The six-membered ring is \"cyclohexene\".\n*   The carbons of the double bond are C1 and C2. The other ring carbons are C3, C4, C5, and C6.\n*   The halogen-substituted carbons are at positions 4 and 5 relative to the double bond.\n*   We have a choice: 4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluoro... or 5,5-dichloro-4,4-difluoro...\n*   According to IUPAC rules, when there is a choice, we use alphabetical order of the substituents (\"chloro\" comes before \"fluoro\") to assign the lower number. Therefore, the CCl₂ group gets position 4.\n*   The final name of the product is **4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohexene**.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n*   **Regioselectivity:** Since 1,3-butadiene is a symmetrical diene, there is only one possible regioisomeric product. It doesn't matter which end of the dienophile attacks which end of the diene; the product is the same.\n*   **Stereoselectivity:** The Diels-Alder reaction is stereospecific. However, in this case, no new chiral centers are formed in the product molecule. The carbons bearing the halogen atoms (CCl₂ and CF₂) are not chiral because they each have two identical substituents. Therefore, there are no stereoisomers to consider.\n\nFinal Answer Analysis: The reaction is a classic Diels-Alder cycloaddition. It forms a six-membered ring with one double bond. The substituents from the dienophile are found on adjacent carbons in the ring. The IUPAC name correctly describes this structure.\n\n<<<4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohexene>>>"
