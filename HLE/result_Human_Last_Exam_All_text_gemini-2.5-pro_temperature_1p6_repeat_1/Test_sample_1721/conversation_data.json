    "Answering the question requires finding the maximum possible density $c$ for a set $A \\subseteq \\{1, \\dots, N\\}$ such that its sumset $A+A$ contains no perfect squares.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\n\nWe are looking for the largest constant $c$ such that there exists a set $A \\subseteq \\{1, 2, \\dots, N\\}$ satisfying two conditions:\n1.  The size of the set is $|A| = (c+o(1))N$. This means that as $N$ grows large, the ratio $|A|/N$ approaches $c$.\n2.  The sumset $A+A = \\{a_1 + a_2 \\mid a_1, a_2 \\in A\\}$ contains no perfect squares. Note that $a_1$ and $a_2$ are not necessarily distinct, so sums of the form $2a$ for $a \\in A$ are also included in the sumset.\n\nThe range of possible sums in $A+A$ is from $1+1=2$ to $N+N=2N$.\n\n### Step 2: Finding a Lower Bound for $c$ using a Modular Construction\n\nA powerful method for constructing such sets is to use modular arithmetic. The idea is to find a modulus $m$ such that we can choose a residue class (or a set of residue classes) $r$ modulo $m$ with the property that sums of any two numbers from this class can never be a square.\n\nLet's test small values of $m$:\n\n*   **Modulo 2:** The squares modulo 2 are $0^2 \\equiv 0$ and $1^2 \\equiv 1$.\n    If we take $A$ to be numbers congruent to $r \\pmod 2$, then any sum $a_1+a_2$ will be congruent to $2r \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$. Since there are squares congruent to $0 \\pmod 2$ (e.g., $4, 16, 36$), this approach fails for $m=2$.\n\n*   **Modulo 3:** The squares modulo 3 are $0^2 \\equiv 0$, $1^2 \\equiv 1$, and $2^2 = 4 \\equiv 1$. So, the set of squares modulo 3 is $S_3 = \\{0, 1\\}$. The value $2$ is not a quadratic residue modulo 3.\n    This gives us an idea. Let's construct a set $A$ where all its elements are congruent to $r \\pmod 3$, such that for any two elements $a_1, a_2 \\in A$, their sum $a_1+a_2$ is congruent to $2 \\pmod 3$.\n    If we choose $a_1 \\equiv r \\pmod 3$ and $a_2 \\equiv r \\pmod 3$, then $a_1+a_2 \\equiv 2r \\pmod 3$. We need $2r \\equiv 2 \\pmod 3$, which implies $r \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$.\n    So, let's define our set $A$ as all numbers in $\\{1, \\dots, N\\}$ that are congruent to $1$ modulo $3$:\n    $A = \\{n \\in \\{1, \\dots, N\\} \\mid n \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3\\}$\n    For any $a_1, a_2 \\in A$, we have $a_1+a_2 \\equiv 1+1=2 \\pmod 3$. Since no perfect square can be congruent to $2 \\pmod 3$, the sumset $A+A$ contains no squares.\n    The size of this set $A$ is $|A| = \\lfloor \\frac{N-1}{3} \\rfloor + 1 = \\frac{N}{3} + O(1)$.\n    Thus, $|A|/N \\to 1/3$ as $N \\to \\infty$. This construction shows that a value of $c=1/3$ is achievable. Therefore, the largest possible $c$ must be at least $1/3$. So, $c \\ge 1/3$.\n\n*   **Modulo 4:** The squares modulo 4 are $0^2 \\equiv 0$ and $1^2 \\equiv 1$ and $2^2 \\equiv 0$ and $3^2 \\equiv 1$. So, $S_4 = \\{0, 1\\}$. The values $2$ and $3$ are not squares modulo 4.\n    Let's choose $A = \\{n \\in \\{1, \\dots, N\\} \\mid n \\equiv r \\pmod 4\\}$. The sum of two elements is $2r \\pmod 4$.\n    We need $2r \\pmod 4$ to be in $\\{2, 3\\}$.\n    If $r=1$, $2r \\equiv 2 \\pmod 4$. If we take $A = \\{n \\mid n \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4\\}$, then $A+A$ has sums $\\equiv 2 \\pmod 4$, which are never square. This works. The density is $c=1/4$.\n    If $r=3$, $2r \\equiv 6 \\equiv 2 \\pmod 4$. This also works and gives density $c=1/4$.\n    Since $1/4 < 1/3$, this does not provide a better lower bound.\n\n*   **Combining residue classes:** We can try to take $A$ to be the union of several residue classes modulo $m$. For instance, using $m=9$, the squares are $S_9 = \\{0^2, 1^2, 2^2, 3^2, 4^2\\} \\pmod 9 = \\{0, 1, 4, 7\\}$. The non-squares are $\\{2,3,5,6,8\\}$.\n    Let's try to find a set of residues $R \\subset \\{0, \\dots, 8\\}$ such that $R+R = \\{r_1+r_2 \\pmod 9 \\mid r_1, r_2 \\in R\\}$ contains only non-squares modulo 9.\n    The set $R = \\{1, 4, 7\\}$ works. Let's check the sums:\n    $1+1 \\equiv 2$ (non-square)\n    $1+4 \\equiv 5$ (non-square)\n    $1+7 \\equiv 8$ (non-square)\n    $4+4 \\equiv 8$ (non-square)\n    $4+7 = 11 \\equiv 2$ (non-square)\n    $7+7 = 14 \\equiv 5$ (non-square)\n    So if we let $A = \\{n \\in \\{1, \\dots, N\\} \\mid n \\pmod 9 \\in \\{1, 4, 7\\}\\}$, then $A+A$ contains no squares. The size of this set gives a density of $|R|/m = 3/9 = 1/3$.\n\nThese constructions show that $c \\ge 1/3$.\n\n### Step 3: Establishing an Upper Bound for $c$\n\nTo show that $c$ cannot be larger than $1/3$, we need an upper bound. This is a significantly harder part of the problem and relies on advanced results in additive number theory.\n\nA full proof is highly technical, but we can outline the reasoning.\nLet's assume there exists a set $A$ with density $c > 1/3$.\nLet's partition $A$ based on residues modulo 3:\n$A_0 = \\{a \\in A \\mid a \\equiv 0 \\pmod 3\\}$\n$A_1 = \\{a \\in A \\mid a \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3\\}$\n$A_2 = \\{a \\in A \\mid a \\equiv 2 \\pmod 3\\}$\n$|A| = |A_0| + |A_1| + |A_2|$.\nThe condition that $A+A$ has no squares imposes several constraints on these subsets:\n1.  $A_1+A_1 \\equiv 2 \\pmod 3$: This is always fine, as no square is $2 \\pmod 3$.\n2.  $A_0+A_0 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 3$: These sums must avoid squares that are multiples of 3 (e.g., $9, 36, 81, \\dots$).\n3.  $A_2+A_2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$: These sums must avoid squares not divisible by 3 (e.g., $1, 4, 16, 25, \\dots$).\n4.  $A_0+A_1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$: These sums must also avoid squares not divisible by 3.\n5.  $A_1+A_2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 3$: These sums must avoid squares that are multiples of 3.\n6.  $A_0+A_2 \\equiv 2 \\pmod 3$: This is always fine.\n\nIf $|A|/N > 1/3$, it forces the sizes of $|A_0|$ and $|A_2|$ to be non-negligible. The many pairs of sums generated from elements in these sets make it \"hard\" to avoid all the squares. Proving this rigorously requires sophisticated tools like the Hardy-Littlewood circle method.\n\nThe definitive result was provided by Imre Z. Ruzsa (in \"Sumsets and powers of integers\", 2012), who proved that if $A \\subseteq \\{1, \\dots, N\\}$ and $A+A$ contains no squares, then $|A| \\le N/3 + O(N^{3/4})$.\nThis implies that\n$$ \\frac{|A|}{N} \\le \\frac{1}{3} + O(N^{-1/4}) $$\nAs $N \\to \\infty$, the $O(N^{-1/4})$ term goes to zero. This shows that for any such set $A$, the limiting density $|A|/N$ cannot exceed $1/3$. Thus, $c \\le 1/3$.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\n\nFrom Step 2, we established a construction that shows $c \\ge 1/3$.\nFrom Step 3, we have the result that $c \\le 1/3$.\nCombining these two bounds, we find that the largest possible value for $c$ must be exactly $1/3$."
