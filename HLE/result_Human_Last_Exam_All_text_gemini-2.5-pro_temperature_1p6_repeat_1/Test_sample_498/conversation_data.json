    "This problem requires identifying a pattern in a sequence of letters. Let's analyze the sequence step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the given sequence.**\nThe sequence is `ZXXCVYBN_`.\n\n**Step 2: Look for a recognizable pattern.**\nA quick look at the letters suggests a connection to the standard QWERTY keyboard layout.\nThe bottom row of letters on a QWERTY keyboard is: **Z X C V B N M**\n\n**Step 3: Compare the sequence with the keyboard pattern.**\nMost of the letters in the sequence (`Z`, `X`, `C`, `V`, `B`, `N`) are from the bottom row of the keyboard and appear in their correct left-to-right order.\nThe letters that do not fit this primary pattern are the second `X` and the `Y`.\n\n**Step 4: Hypothesize a structure for the sequence.**\nLet's assume the sequence is formed by interleaving two different patterns.\n*   **Pattern 1 (Base Sequence):** The letters from the bottom row of the QWERTY keyboard in order: `Z, X, C, V, B, N, M, ...`\n*   **Pattern 2 (Inserted Sequence):** The letters that interrupt the base sequence.\n\n**Step 5: Deconstruct the sequence to identify the two patterns.**\nLet's see how the two patterns are combined.\nThe sequence appears to be built in groups of three: two letters from the base sequence, followed by one letter from the inserted sequence.\n\n*   **Group 1:** The first two letters from the base sequence are `Z` and `X`. The third letter in the given sequence is `X`. So, the first group is `Z, X, X`.\n*   **Group 2:** The next two letters from the base sequence are `C` and `V`. The next letter in the given sequence is `Y`. So, the second group is `C, V, Y`.\n*   **Group 3:** The next two letters from the base sequence are `B` and `N`. The next letter in the sequence is the one we need to find. This will be the third letter in the inserted sequence.\n\n**Step 6: Analyze the inserted sequence.**\nThe inserted letters we have identified are `X` (from Group 1) and `Y` (from Group 2).\nThe inserted sequence is therefore `X, Y, ...`\n\n**Step 7: Determine the next letter in the inserted sequence.**\nThe sequence `X, Y, ...` is a simple alphabetical progression. The next letter after Y in the alphabet is Z.\n\n**Step 8: Conclude the final answer.**\nThe pattern is (Base, Base, Insert).\n`Z (Base) X (Base) X (Insert)`\n`C (Base) V (Base) Y (Insert)`\n`B (Base) N (Base) ? (Insert)`\nThe next letter required is the third letter in the inserted sequence (`X, Y, ?`), which is `Z`.\n\n<<<Z>>>"
