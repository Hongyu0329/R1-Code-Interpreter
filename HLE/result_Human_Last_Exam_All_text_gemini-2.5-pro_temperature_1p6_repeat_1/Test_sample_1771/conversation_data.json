    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the phonological development of the Proto-Indo-European (PIE) word *seh₂gieti* into Proto-Germanic, Old Norse, Old English, and Old High German.\n\n### **Analysis of the PIE form**\n\nThe starting point is the PIE verb **\\*seh₂gieti**, meaning '(s)he’s giving a sign'. We can break it down into its constituent parts:\n*   **Root:** *seh₂g-*\n*   **Present tense suffix:** *-ie-*\n*   **3rd person singular ending:** *-ti*\n\nA crucial first step is to resolve the laryngeal *h₂*. The sequence *eh₂* simplifies to a long vowel *ā* within PIE itself. Therefore, the form that serves as the input for Proto-Germanic sound changes is effectively **\\*sāgyeti**.\n\n---\n### **Step 1: Derivation of the Proto-Germanic (PGmc) form**\n\nTo get from late PIE **\\*sāgyeti** to Proto-Germanic, we must apply several characteristic sound laws. The verb belongs to the class of *ye/yo*-presents, which become Class I weak verbs in Germanic.\n\n1.  **PIE *ā* > PGmc *ō***: The long vowel *ā* from PIE systematically becomes *ō* in Proto-Germanic.\n    *   *sāg-* → *sōg-*\n\n2.  **Grimm's Law**: This law affects all PIE stop consonants.\n    *   The voiced velar stop **\\*g** becomes a voiceless velar stop **\\*k**.\n    *   *sōg-* → **\\*sōk-**\n    *   The voiceless dental stop **\\*t** in the ending *-ti* becomes a voiceless dental fricative **\\*þ**.\n    *   *-ti* → *-þi*\n\n3.  **Verbal Morphology**: The PIE present stem *-ye-* becomes the Germanic Class I weak verb suffix *-ja-*. The 3rd person singular present indicative ending PIE *-eti* develops into PGmc **\\*-iþ(i)**. The stem vowel *-j-* (or *-i-*) connects the root to the ending. The root *sōk-* is a \"heavy\" root because it contains a long vowel.\n\n4.  **Combining the elements**:\n    *   Root: *sōk-*\n    *   Stem vowel: *-i-*\n    *   Ending: *-þ*\n    *   This gives the Proto-Germanic 3rd person singular form **\\*sōkiþ**. The full infinitive would be reconstructed as **\\*sōkijaną**.\n\n**Proto-Germanic Result: \\*sōkiþ**\n\n---\n### **Step 2: Derivation of the Old Norse (ON) form**\n\nWe start from the Proto-Germanic form **\\*sōkiþ**.\n\n1.  **I-Umlaut**: The high front vowel *i* in the suffix (*-kiþ*) causes the preceding back vowel *ō* in the root to be fronted.\n    *   *ō* → *œ̄* (a long, front, rounded vowel, written as `<œ>`).\n    *   *sōkiþ* → *sœ̄kiþ*\n\n2.  **Loss of Medial Vowel**: Unstressed medial vowels were generally lost in Old Norse (syncope). The *-i-* is lost.\n    *   *sœ̄kiþ* → *sœ̄kþ*\n\n3.  **Ending Change (Analogy)**: The original PGmc 3rd person singular ending *-iþ* did not survive into Old Norse. Instead, the 2nd person singular ending *-r* (from earlier *-R* < PGmc *-iz*) was generalized to the 3rd person singular for most verbs. For i-umlauted verbs like this one, the ending is **-ir**.\n\n4.  **Combining the elements**:\n    *   Umlauted root: *sœk-*\n    *   Analogical ending: *-ir*\n\n**Old Norse Result: sœkir**\n\n---\n### **Step 3: Derivation of the Old English (OE) form**\n\nWe again start from the Proto-Germanic form **\\*sōkiþ**.\n\n1.  **I-Umlaut**: As in Old Norse, the *i* in the suffix triggers i-umlaut on the root vowel *ō*. In Old English, *ō* umlauts to *ē*.\n    *   *ō* → *ē* (written as `<e>`).\n    *   *sōkiþ* → *sēkiþ*\n\n2.  **Palatalization**: In Old English, the velar stop *k* was palatalized to the affricate /tʃ/ (written as `<c>`) when it came before a front vowel like the *i* of the suffix.\n    *   *sēkiþ* → *sēčiþ* (phonetically)\n\n3.  **Ending Morphology**: The PGmc ending *-iþ* is retained, with the linking vowel *-i-* weakening to *-e-* and the fricative *þ* being written as `<þ>` or `<ð>`. This results in the ending **-eþ/-eð**. In later or some dialectal forms, the `-e-` is lost (syncope), resulting in the contracted ending `-þ`. The uncontracted form is more standard for early West Saxon.\n\n4.  **Combining the elements**:\n    *   Umlauted and palatalized root: *sēc-* (/se:tʃ/)\n    *   Ending: *-eþ*\n\n**Old English Result: sēceþ** (or the contracted form *sēcþ*)\n\n---\n### **Step 4: Derivation of the Old High German (OHG) form**\n\nThe derivation starts from PGmc **\\*sōkiþ**.\n\n1.  **Vowel Change**: Proto-Germanic *ō* diphthongizes to **uo** in Old High German.\n    *   *sōkiþ* → *suokiþ*\n    *   **Careful point:** OHG does have i-umlaut (*uo* > *üe*), but it is a later phenomenon and is often not reflected in the spelling of older texts. The form with *uo* is more characteristic of the OHG period.\n\n2.  **High German Consonant Shift (Second Sound Shift)**: This is the defining sound change of High German.\n    *   The post-vocalic voiceless stop **\\*k** shifts to a voiceless velar fricative /xx/, spelled **<hh>**.\n    *   *suokiþ* → *suo**hh**iþ*\n    *   The voiceless dental fricative **\\*þ** shifts to the voiced stop **d**.\n    *   *suohhiþ* → *suo**hh**id*\n\n3.  **Final Devoicing**: The resulting final *-d* is devoiced to **-t** at the end of the word.\n    *   *suohhid* → *suo**hh**it*\n\n4.  **Ending Morphology**: The linking vowel *-i-* and the now-shifted ending *-t* are preserved.\n\n**Old High German Result: suohhit**\n\n---\n### **Final Answer Summary**\n\n*   **Proto-Germanic:** *sōkiþ\n*   **Old Norse:** sœkir\n*   **Old English:** sēceþ\n*   **Old High German:** suohhit\n\n<<<Proto-Germanic: *sōkiþ\nOld Norse: sœkir\nOld English: sēceþ\nOld High German: suohhit>>>"
