    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the geometric objects**\n\n*   **C:** A Riemann surface of genus `g = 3`. This is a 1-dimensional complex manifold.\n*   **X = C^(15):** The 15th symmetric power of C. This is the space of effective divisors of degree 15 on C. An element of `X` is a formal sum `D = P_1 + ... + P_15`, where `P_i` are points on `C` (not necessarily distinct). `X` is a smooth complex projective variety of dimension 15.\n*   **Neron-Severi Group NS(X):** This is the group of divisors on X modulo algebraic equivalence. Its rank, denoted `ρ(X)`, is called the Picard number of X. We need to find the smallest and largest possible values of `ρ(X)` as `C` varies over all genus 3 curves.\n\n**2. Relate the geometry of X to the Jacobian of C**\n\nThe key to analyzing `X = C^(15)` is the Abel-Jacobi map.\n*   **Abel-Jacobi Map:** There is a map `u: C^(d) -> Pic^d(C)` that sends a divisor `D` to its linear equivalence class `[D]`.\n*   **Base of the map:** The target space `Pic^d(C)` is the space of all divisor classes of degree `d`. For any `d`, `Pic^d(C)` is a torsor for the Jacobian `J(C) = Pic^0(C)`. As complex manifolds, `Pic^d(C)` is isomorphic to `J(C)`, which is a 3-dimensional abelian variety.\n*   **Fibers of the map:** The fiber over a point `[D] ∈ Pic^d(C)` is the set of all effective divisors linearly equivalent to `D`. This is the complete linear system `|D|`, which is a projective space `ℙ(H^0(C, O(D)))`.\n*   **Dimension of the fibers:** We need to find the dimension of `|D|` for a divisor `D` of degree `d=15` on a curve `C` of genus `g=3`. The dimension of `|D|` is `h^0(C, O(D)) - 1`.\n    By the Riemann-Roch theorem:\n    `h^0(C, O(D)) - h^1(C, O(D)) = deg(D) - g + 1`\n    By Serre duality, `h^1(C, O(D)) = h^0(C, O(K_C - D))`, where `K_C` is the canonical divisor.\n    The degree of `K_C` is `2g - 2 = 2*3 - 2 = 4`.\n    The degree of `K_C - D` is `4 - 15 = -11`.\n    Since `deg(K_C - D) < 0`, there are no non-zero global sections, so `h^0(C, O(K_C - D)) = 0`.\n    This implies `h^1(C, O(D)) = 0`.\n    Plugging this back into the Riemann-Roch formula:\n    `h^0(C, O(D)) - 0 = 15 - 3 + 1 = 13`.\n    The dimension of the fiber `|D|` is `h^0(C, O(D)) - 1 = 13 - 1 = 12`.\n*   **Structure of X:** Since the dimension of the fiber is constant for all divisors of degree 15, the Abel-Jacobi map `u: C^(15) -> Pic^15(C)` makes `C^(15)` a projective bundle with fiber `ℙ^12`. As `Pic^15(C)` is isomorphic to `J(C)`, we conclude that `X = C^(15)` is a `ℙ^12`-fibration over the Jacobian `J(C)`.\n\n**3. Relate the Neron-Severi Rank of X to that of J(C)**\n\nFor a variety `X` which is a projective bundle over a base `Y`, the Neron-Severi group of `X` is related to that of `Y`. Specifically, `NS(X) ≅ π*(NS(Y)) ⊕ ℤξ`, where `π` is the projection map and `ξ` is the class of the relative hyperplane bundle. Taking the ranks of these free abelian groups, we get a simple relation for the Picard numbers:\n`ρ(X) = ρ(Y) + 1`\nIn our case, `X = C^(15)` is a `ℙ^12`-bundle over `Y = J(C)`. Therefore:\n`ρ(C^(15)) = ρ(J(C)) + 1`\n\n**4. Find the Range of the Picard Number of J(C)**\n\nThe problem is now reduced to finding the minimum and maximum possible values of `ρ(J(C))` for a curve `C` of genus 3. `J(C)` is a 3-dimensional principally polarized abelian variety. The Picard number `ρ(J(C))` depends on the endomorphism ring `End(J(C))`.\n\n*   **Smallest Possible Rank `ρ(J(C))`:**\n    For a *generic* curve `C` of genus `g`, its Jacobian `J(C)` has the minimum possible number of endomorphisms, namely `End(J(C)) = ℤ`. These are just multiplications by integers. In this case, the Neron-Severi group `NS(J(C))` is generated by the class of the principal polarization (the theta divisor). The rank `ρ(J(C))` is 1. This is the smallest possible rank for any simple abelian variety.\n    Therefore, `ρ_min(J(C)) = 1`.\n\n*   **Largest Possible Rank `ρ(J(C))`:**\n    The Picard number of a `g`-dimensional abelian variety `A` is bounded by the Hodge number `h^(1,1)(A)`. For `A=J(C)`, `h^(1,1)(J(C)) = g^2 = 3^2 = 9`. So, `ρ(J(C)) ≤ 9`.\n    This maximum value is achieved if `J(C)` has sufficiently many endomorphisms, a situation known as Complex Multiplication (CM). Specifically, `ρ(J(C)) = g^2` is achieved if and only if `J(C)` is isogenous to a product `E^g` of a single elliptic curve `E` which has CM.\n    For genus `g=3`, such curves exist. For example:\n    1.  The **Fermat quartic curve** `x^4 + y^4 + z^4 = 0` has genus 3. Its Jacobian is isogenous to `E^3`, where `E` is the elliptic curve `y^2 = x^3 - x` with CM by `ℤ[i]`.\n    2.  The **Klein quartic curve** `x^3y + y^3z + z^3x = 0` has genus 3. Its Jacobian is isogenous to `E^3`, where `E` is an elliptic curve with CM by the Eisenstein integers of `ℚ(√-7)`.\n    Since an isogeny preserves the rank of the Neron-Severi group, the Jacobians of these curves have `ρ(J(C)) = 9`.\n    Therefore, `ρ_max(J(C)) = 9`.\n\n**5. Calculate the Final Answer**\n\nWe now substitute the minimum and maximum values of `ρ(J(C))` into our formula `ρ(X) = ρ(J(C)) + 1`.\n\n*   **Smallest rank of NS(X):**\n    `ρ_min(X) = ρ_min(J(C)) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2`.\n\n*   **Largest rank of NS(X):**\n    `ρ_max(X) = ρ_max(J(C)) + 1 = 9 + 1 = 10`.\n\n### Summary of Careful Points\n*   Correctly identifying `X = C^(15)` as a `ℙ^12`-fibration over `J(C)`. This relies on the condition `d > 2g - 2`.\n*   Using the correct formula `ρ(Projective Bundle) = ρ(Base) + 1`.\n*   Knowing the range of possible Picard numbers for the Jacobian of a genus 3 curve. This requires knowing about generic Jacobians (`ρ=1`) and CM Jacobians (`ρ=g^2=9`).\n*   Confirming that the theoretical maximum `ρ(J(C))=9` is actually achievable by a curve of genus 3.\n\nThe smallest possible rank is 2, and the largest is 10.\n\n<<<The smallest possible rank is 2 and the largest possible rank is 10.>>>"
