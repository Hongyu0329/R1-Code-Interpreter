    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Parametric Curve**\n\nThe curve is defined in two pieces based on the parameter `t`:\n1.  For $t \\in [0, \\pi]$:\n    *   $x = \\cos t$\n    *   $y = \\sin t$ (since $b=1$)\n    This represents the upper half of a unit circle centered at the origin, as $x^2 + y^2 = \\cos^2 t + \\sin^2 t = 1$ and for this interval of $t$, $\\sin t \\ge 0$.\n\n2.  For $t \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$:\n    *   $x = \\cos t$\n    *   $y = 5 \\sin t$ (since $b=5$)\n    This can be described by the equation $(\\frac{x}{1})^2 + (\\frac{y}{5})^2 = \\cos^2 t + \\sin^2 t = 1$, which is an ellipse centered at the origin with a semi-horizontal axis of 1 and a semi-vertical axis of 5. For this interval of $t$, $\\sin t < 0$, so this part of the curve represents the lower half of the ellipse.\n\nThe complete figure is composed of the upper semi-circle of radius 1 and the lower semi-ellipse with semi-axes 1 and 5.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Boundaries of the Figure**\n\nTo find the smallest square that encloses the figure, we first need to find the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates that the figure occupies. This defines the \"bounding box\" of the figure.\n\n*   **Finding the range of x:**\n    The x-coordinate is given by $x = \\cos t$ for the entire range $t \\in [0, 2\\pi]$. The cosine function has a minimum value of -1 and a maximum value of 1.\n    *   $x_{min} = -1$\n    *   $x_{max} = 1$\n\n*   **Finding the range of y:**\n    The y-coordinate is defined piecewise. We need to find the maximum value of y in the first part and the minimum value of y in the second part.\n    *   For $t \\in [0, \\pi]$, $y = \\sin t$. The maximum value of $\\sin t$ in this interval is 1 (at $t=\\pi/2$). The minimum is 0. So, for the upper part, $y$ ranges from 0 to 1.\n    *   For $t \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$, $y = 5\\sin t$. The minimum value of $\\sin t$ in this interval is -1 (at $t=3\\pi/2$). Therefore, the minimum value of y is $5 \\times (-1) = -5$. The maximum value is approached as t approaches $\\pi$ and $2\\pi$, where y approaches 0.\n    *   Combining both parts, the overall range for the y-coordinate is from the absolute minimum to the absolute maximum.\n    *   $y_{min} = -5$\n    *   $y_{max} = 1$\n\n**Step 3: Define the Bounding Box and the Smallest Enclosing Square**\n\nThe figure is contained within a rectangle defined by the ranges we found:\n*   Width of the bounding box: $W = x_{max} - x_{min} = 1 - (-1) = 2$\n*   Height of the bounding box: $H = y_{max} - y_{min} = 1 - (-5) = 6$\n\nThe smallest square that can \"outcircle\" or enclose this $2 \\times 6$ rectangular region must have a side length equal to the larger of its dimensions.\n\n*   Side length of the square, $s = \\max(W, H) = \\max(2, 6) = 6$.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Area of the Square**\n\nThe area of a square is the side length squared.\n\n*   Area = $s^2 = 6^2 = 36$.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   It is crucial to recognize that the curve is piecewise and consists of parts of two different conic sections.\n*   Finding the extreme values (min/max) for x and y requires analyzing the functions over their respective intervals.\n*   The smallest enclosing square (with sides parallel to the axes) is determined by the larger dimension of the figure's bounding box.\n*   The final question asks for the area of the square, not its side length.\n\nFinal Answer Calculation:\n1.  x-range: $[-1, 1]$. Width = $1 - (-1) = 2$.\n2.  y-range: $[-5, 1]$. Height = $1 - (-5) = 6$.\n3.  Side of smallest enclosing square = $\\max(2, 6) = 6$.\n4.  Area = $6 \\times 6 = 36$.\n\n<<<36>>>"
