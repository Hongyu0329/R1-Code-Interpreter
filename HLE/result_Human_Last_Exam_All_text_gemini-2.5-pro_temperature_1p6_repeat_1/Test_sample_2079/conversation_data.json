    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Components of the Question:**\n    *   **Location:** Bártfa (the Hungarian name for the town, now known as Bardejov in Slovakia).\n    *   **Position:** Judge (*bíró* in Hungarian, *Richter* in German, *judex* in Latin). This was the highest office in the town's administration, equivalent to a mayor.\n    *   **Timeframe:** The specific year 1461.\n\n2.  **Understand the Historical Context:**\n    *   In the 15th century, Bártfa was a Royal Free Town within the Kingdom of Hungary. These towns had a high degree of self-governance.\n    *   The \"judge\" was the chief magistrate of the town. This position was typically held by a wealthy and influential citizen, often a merchant.\n    *   The judge was usually elected for a one-year term by the town council (*senatus* or *magistratus*). Therefore, the judge for 1460 or 1462 could very well be a different person.\n\n3.  **Consult Historical Sources:**\n    *   To answer this specific question, one must consult the historical records of the town of Bardejov. Fortunately, Bardejov has exceptionally well-preserved town archives, which are part of a UNESCO World Heritage site.\n    *   Historians and archivists have compiled lists of town judges (*richtári*) from these records. These lists are the primary source for identifying the officeholder for any given year.\n\n4.  **Identify the Individual:**\n    *   According to the compiled lists of magistrates from the Bardejov town archives, the individual who served as the judge of Bártfa in the year 1461 was **Peter Wagschott**.\n    *   The Wagschott family was a prominent and wealthy patrician family in Bártfa during the 15th century. The name may appear with slight variations in spelling in historical documents (e.g., Waghsott).\n\n5.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    *   By cross-referencing historical records and academic publications concerning the history of Bardejov, the judge for the year 1461 can be definitively identified.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Spelling:** Medieval names often have inconsistent spellings across documents in different languages (German, Latin, Hungarian). Peter Wagschott is the commonly accepted English/German spelling.\n*   **Title:** The term \"judge\" in this context does not solely mean a judicial officer but refers to the chief executive of the town government.\n*   **Annual Term:** It is crucial to confirm the specific year, as the position changed hands annually. Peter Wagschott held the office specifically in 1461.\n\n***\n\n<<<Peter Wagschott>>>"
