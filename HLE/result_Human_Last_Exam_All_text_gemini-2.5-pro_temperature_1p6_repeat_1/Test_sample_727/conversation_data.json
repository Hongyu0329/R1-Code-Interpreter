    "This problem requires us to find a drawing move for Black in a specific position from the 2021 World Chess Championship match between Magnus Carlsen and Ian Nepomniachtchi.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understand the Position:**\n    The game has reached move 130. After White's move `130. Kh3`, the board configuration is as follows:\n    *   **White:** King on h3, Rook on f5, Knight on g3, pawn on e5.\n    *   **Black:** King on e8, Queen on a2.\n    It is Black's turn to move.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Blunder in the Game:**\n    In the actual game, Black played `130... Qe6?`. This move was a decisive blunder. The reason it fails is that it allows White to execute a winning plan:\n    *   `131. Kh4!` White's king advances, attacking the Black queen.\n    *   `131... Qh6+` This is Black's only reasonable check.\n    *   `132. Nh5!` This is the killer move. The knight blocks the check, is immune from capture, and now supports the unstoppable advance of the e- and f-pawns. Black has no more counterplay and the position is lost.\n\n3.  **Identify the Drawing Idea:**\n    To save the game, Black must prevent White from successfully executing the `Kh4` followed by `Nh5` maneuver. A drawing move for Black must accomplish one of two things:\n    *   **Refute `Kh4`:** If White plays `131. Kh4`, Black must have a response (usually a series of checks) that forces a draw by perpetual check. The key to a successful perpetual check is often preventing White from using `Nh5` as a block.\n    *   **Create a Positional Draw:** If White avoids `Kh4` and instead tries to slowly improve, for instance with `131. e6` or `131. Rf2`, Black must have a plan to activate their king or force a draw by repetition.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Answer Choices:**\n    Let's analyze the provided options based on the criteria above, focusing on the most critical response from White, `131. Kh4`.\n\n    *   **Moves that lose to the `Kh4-Nh5` plan:** Several options allow a sequence similar to the game's losing line. For example:\n        *   **H. Qh2:** `130... Qh2+` is a direct check. White's only legal response is `131. Nh5`. After this move, the knight is not attacked. It controls key squares, and the Black queen is sidelined on h2. White will follow up with `f6` or by improving the king position and win easily. Thus, `Qh2` is a losing blunder.\n        *   **L. Qc2:** After `130... Qc2`, White plays `131. Kh4`. Black can check with `131... Qh2+`, but this transposes into the losing line described above where White replies `132. Nh5`.\n        *   **D. Qf2+:** `130... Qf2+`. This check helps White's king to a more active square with `131. Kh4`. After that, Black's checks run out and White consolidates a winning position.\n\n    *   **Moves that secure a draw:** The best moves for Black are those that successfully counter `131. Kh4`.\n        *   **A. Qa1:** This move is a clear draw. Let's see why:\n            *   If White plays `131. Kh4`, Black responds with `131... Qh1+`. Now, the critical `Nh5` block is impossible. If White plays `132. Nh5?`, Black simply captures it with `132... Qxh5+`, winning the knight. Therefore, White's king must move (`132. Kg4`), which allows Black to continue checking (`132... Qg2+`) and force a draw by perpetual check.\n            *   If White plays a quieter move like `131. Rf2` (to prevent checks on the g-file), Black can simply play `131... Qa2`, threatening to repeat the position if the rook moves back to f5. White cannot make progress.\n        *   **B. Qa7:** This move also draws for the same reasons as `Qa1`. After `131. Kh4`, Black checks with `131... Qg1+`. The block `132. Nh5?` is again refuted by `132... Qxh5+`.\n        *   **Other a-file moves (G, I, J, K, N):** All other moves that place the queen on the a-file are also sufficient to draw, as they either lead to a successful perpetual check or allow Black to meet the pawn push `e6` with king activation (`...Ke7`), leading to a known theoretical draw.\n\n5.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    The analysis shows that there are multiple drawing moves available to Black from the list of options, namely all the moves on the a-file (A, B, G, I, J, K, N). Moves to other squares, like `H. Qh2`, are losing blunders. Since the question asks for *a* move that could draw the game, and `A. Qa1` is one of the choices and demonstrably leads to a draw through clear and forcing lines, it is a correct answer.\n\n<<<A>>>"
