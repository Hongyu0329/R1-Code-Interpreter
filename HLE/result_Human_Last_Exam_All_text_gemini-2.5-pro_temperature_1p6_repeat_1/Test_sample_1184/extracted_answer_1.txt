1. **Interaction Hotspots (Binding):** The key residues are located in the Guanylate Kinase-like (GK) domain of the beta-1 subunit. They form a binding pocket for the Alpha Interaction Domain (AID) of the alpha-1 subunit. The primary hotspots are:
    *   **Y317** (Tyrosine)
    *   **L349** (Leucine)
    *   **W365** (Tryptophan)
    *   **W391** (Tryptophan)
    *   **I393** (Isoleucine)
    *   **M397** (Methionine)
    *   **R400** (Arginine)

2. **Gating Modulation Hotspots:** The key residues for fine-tuning the channel's gating properties (primarily inactivation speed) are located in the N-terminal region of the beta-1 subunit. The primary hotspots are:
    *   **L82** (Leucine)
    *   **L85** (Leucine)
    *   **Y93** (Tyrosine)
