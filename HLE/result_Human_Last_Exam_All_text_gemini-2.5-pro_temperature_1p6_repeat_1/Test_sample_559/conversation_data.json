    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the separatrix of the given system of differential equations.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the system and the domain**\nThe system is given by:\n1.  $d' = 2d^2 + (-3u+5u^2)d - u^3(1-u)$\n2.  $u' = u^2(u-1)$\n\nWe analyze the system in the $(u, d)$ phase plane, restricted to the upper half-plane $u \\geq 0$.\n\n**Step 2: Find the equilibrium points**\nEquilibrium points (or critical points) are points where both derivatives are zero, i.e., $d'=0$ and $u'=0$.\n\nFrom $u'=0$:\n$u^2(u-1) = 0 \\implies u=0$ or $u=1$.\n\nWe substitute these values of $u$ into the equation for $d'$ to find the corresponding values of $d$.\n\n*   **Case 1: u = 0**\n    $d' = 2d^2 + (-3(0)+5(0)^2)d - 0 = 0 \\implies 2d^2 = 0 \\implies d=0$.\n    This gives the equilibrium point $P_1 = (0, 0)$.\n\n*   **Case 2: u = 1**\n    $d' = 2d^2 + (-3(1)+5(1)^2)d - 1^3(1-1) = 0 \\implies 2d^2 + 2d = 0 \\implies 2d(d+1) = 0$.\n    This gives $d=0$ or $d=-1$.\n    This gives two more equilibrium points: $P_2 = (1, 0)$ and $P_3 = (1, -1)$.\n\nThe equilibrium points in the domain $u \\geq 0$ are $(0, 0)$, $(1, 0)$, and $(1, -1)$.\n\n**Step 3: Classify the equilibrium points using linearization**\nThe Jacobian matrix of the system is:\n$J(u, d) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial u} & \\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial d} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial d'}{\\partial u} & \\frac{\\partial d'}{\\partial d} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 3u^2 - 2u & 0 \\\\ (-3+10u)d - 3u^2+4u^3 & 4d -3u+5u^2 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nSince the Jacobian is a lower triangular matrix, its eigenvalues are the diagonal entries:\n$\\lambda_1 = 3u^2 - 2u$\n$\\lambda_2 = 4d -3u+5u^2$\n\n*   **At $P_1 = (0, 0)$:**\n    $\\lambda_1 = 0$, $\\lambda_2 = 0$. The point is a degenerate node, and linearization is inconclusive.\n\n*   **At $P_2 = (1, 0)$:**\n    $\\lambda_1 = 3(1)^2 - 2(1) = 1$\n    $\\lambda_2 = 4(0) -3(1)+5(1)^2 = 2$\n    Both eigenvalues are positive, so $P_2 = (1, 0)$ is an unstable node.\n\n*   **At $P_3 = (1, -1)$:**\n    $\\lambda_1 = 3(1)^2 - 2(1) = 1$\n    $\\lambda_2 = 4(-1) -3(1)+5(1)^2 = -4 - 3 + 5 = -2$\n    The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1 = 1 > 0$ and $\\lambda_2 = -2 < 0$, so $P_3 = (1, -1)$ is a saddle point.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the separatrices**\nA separatrix is a curve in the phase plane that separates regions of different qualitative behavior. The stable and unstable manifolds of a saddle point are separatrices. Thus, we need to find the stable and unstable manifolds of the saddle point $P_3 = (1, -1)$.\n\n**Step 5: Find the equations for the stable and unstable manifolds**\nWe look for invariant curves, which are special trajectories of the system.\nAn invariant curve can be found by solving the ODE for the phase portrait:\n$\\frac{dd}{du} = \\frac{d'}{u'} = \\frac{2d^2 + (-3u+5u^2)d - u^3(1-u)}{u^2(u-1)}$\n\n*   **Finding the stable manifold:**\n    The eigenvector for the stable eigenvalue $\\lambda_2 = -2$ at $P_3=(1,-1)$ determines the direction of the stable manifold.\n    $(J - \\lambda_2 I)v = 0 \\implies \\begin{pmatrix} 3 & 0 \\\\ -6 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} v_u \\\\ v_d \\end{pmatrix} = 0 \\implies 3v_u = 0 \\implies v_u = 0$.\n    The eigenvector is vertical, e.g., $(0, 1)$. This means the stable manifold is tangent to the vertical line at $(1,-1)$.\n    Let's check if the line $u=1$ is an invariant manifold. If $u(t)=1$ for some $t$, then $u' = 1^2(1-1)=0$. So, if a trajectory starts on the line $u=1$, it stays on it.\n    Since the line $u=1$ is an invariant manifold passing through the saddle point $(1,-1)$ with the correct tangent direction, it contains the stable manifold. Thus, the equation for the stable manifold is $u=1$.\n\n*   **Finding the unstable manifold:**\n    The eigenvector for the unstable eigenvalue $\\lambda_1 = 1$ at $P_3=(1,-1)$ determines the direction of the unstable manifold.\n    $(J - \\lambda_1 I)v = 0 \\implies \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ -6 & -3 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} v_u \\\\ v_d \\end{pmatrix} = 0 \\implies -6v_u - 3v_d = 0 \\implies v_d = -2v_u$.\n    The eigenvector is, e.g., $(1, -2)$, meaning the slope of the unstable manifold at $(1,-1)$ is $-2$.\n    We seek an invariant curve of the form $d=f(u)$. By trying a polynomial ansatz $d(u) = au^2+bu+c$, we can find that $d=-u^2$ is an exact invariant curve of the system.\n    Let's verify this. If $d = -u^2$, then $d' = -2u \\cdot u'$.\n    Substitute this into the first DE:\n    $-2u \\cdot u' = 2(-u^2)^2 + (-3u+5u^2)(-u^2) - u^3(1-u)$\n    $-2u \\cdot [u^2(u-1)] = 2u^4 - (3u^3-5u^4) - (u^3-u^4)$\n    $-2u^4 + 2u^3 = 2u^4 - 3u^3 + 5u^4 - u^3 + u^4$\n    $-2u^4 + 2u^3 = (2+5+1)u^4 - (3+1)u^3 = 8u^4-4u^3$. There seems to be a mistake in the reasoning above.\n\nLet's recheck the verification of $d=-u^2$.\nLHS: $d' = -2u u' = -2u (u^2(u-1)) = -2u^4 + 2u^3$.\nRHS: $2d^2 + (-3u+5u^2)d - u^3(1-u) = 2(-u^2)^2 + (5u^2-3u)(-u^2) - u^3+u^4 = 2u^4 - 5u^4 + 3u^3 - u^3 + u^4 = -2u^4 + 2u^3$.\nLHS = RHS. The verification is correct.\n\nSo, $d=-u^2$ is an invariant manifold. Let's check if it corresponds to the unstable manifold.\n1.  It passes through the saddle point $P_3=(1,-1)$: $-1 = -(1)^2$, which is true.\n2.  Its slope at the saddle point matches the unstable direction. The slope of the curve is $\\frac{dd}{du} = -2u$. At $u=1$, the slope is $-2$. This matches the slope of the unstable eigenvector.\nTherefore, the curve $d=-u^2$ is the unstable manifold of the saddle point.\n\n**Step 6: Final Answer**\nThe separatrices are the stable and unstable manifolds of the saddle point $(1, -1)$. We have found their equations to be $u=1$ (stable manifold) and $d=-u^2$ (unstable manifold). The question asks for \"the separatrix\", which usually refers to the set of all separatrices. This set is the union of the two curves we found. The union of the curves $u-1=0$ and $d+u^2=0$ can be represented by the single equation $(u-1)(d+u^2)=0$.\n\n<<<The separatrix is the union of the curves defined by the equations $u=1$ and $d=-u^2$. This can be written as a single equation: $(u-1)(d+u^2)=0$.>>>"
