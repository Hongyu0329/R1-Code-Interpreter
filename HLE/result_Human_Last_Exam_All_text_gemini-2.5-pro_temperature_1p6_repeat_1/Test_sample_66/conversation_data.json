    "Answering the question step-by-step:\n\n### Step 1: Define the Matrix from the Flag of Tonga\n\nThe flag of Tonga has a red field, and in the top-left corner (the canton), there is a white rectangle containing a red \"couped\" cross. A couped cross is one that does not extend to the edges of the containing rectangle.\n\nWe are to create a matrix `M` from an image of this flag.\n*   Red pixels are assigned the value `a`.\n*   White pixels are assigned the value `b`.\n\nLet's assume the image has `m` rows and `n` columns. The canton occupies the top-left `p x q` block of pixels.\nThe structure of matrix `M` is a block matrix:\n```\n   M = [ C | A_1 ]\n       [---|-----]\n       [ A_2 | A_3 ]\n```\nwhere:\n*   `C` is the `p x q` matrix representing the canton. It has entries `a` for the red cross and `b` for the white background.\n*   `A_1`, `A_2`, `A_3` are matrices representing the red field of the flag. All their entries are `a`.\n\n### Step 2: Simplify the Matrix Using Row Operations to Find its Rank\n\nThe rank of a matrix is invariant under elementary row and column operations. The goal is to find the *maximal possible* rank, which means we can choose the dimensions (`m, n, p, q`) and the values (`a, b`) to achieve this maximum. We assume `a \\neq b`, as `a=b` would make the matrix have rank 1 (or 0 if `a=b=0`), which is not the maximum.\n\nLet's assume we have at least one row and one column outside the canton (i.e., `m > p` and `n > q`), which is a reasonable assumption for a flag image. The last row of `M` is entirely composed of `a`'s: `R_m = (a, a, ..., a)`. We also assume `a \\neq 0` for now.\n\nWe can subtract this last row, `R_m`, from all other rows of `M`. This operation does not change the rank.\n1.  For any row `i` from `p+1` to `m-1`, its original values are all `a`. So `R_i - R_m` results in a zero row.\n2.  For any row `i` from `1` to `p` (i.e., a row within the canton), its original form is `(row i of C, a, a, ..., a)`. After subtracting `R_m`, the new row becomes `( (row i of C) - (a, ..., a), 0, ..., 0 )`.\n\nAfter these row operations, the matrix (let's call it `M'`) has this structure:\n```\n   M' = [ C* |  0  ]\n        [----|-----]\n        [  0  |  0  ]\n        [----|-----]\n        [ a...a|a...a ]\n```\n*   `C*` is a `p x q` matrix. The entries of `C*` are `(b-a)` for the white background pixels of the canton and `(a-a)=0` for the red cross pixels.\n*   The `n-q` columns to the right are all zero except in the last row.\n*   The `m-p-1` rows below `C*` are all zero.\n*   The last row is the original `(a, a, ..., a)`.\n\nThe rows of the top-left `p x n` block of `M'` are of the form `(v_i, 0, ..., 0)`, where `v_i` are the rows of `C*`. Any linear combination of these rows will also have zeros in the last `n-q` columns. The last row of `M'`, `(a, ..., a)`, has non-zero entries in these columns (if `a \\neq 0` and `n>q`). Therefore, the last row is linearly independent of the first `p` rows.\n\nThis means `rank(M) = rank(M') = rank(C*) + 1`.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Rank of the Canton Matrix C*\n\nThe problem now reduces to finding the maximal possible rank of `C*`.\n`C*` is a `p x q` matrix with `0` on the red cross and `(b-a)` on the white background.\nIf `a \\neq b`, `rank(C*)` is equal to the rank of a 0-1 matrix, let's call it `B_C`, where `B_C` has `0`s for the cross and `1`s for the background. We can choose the resolution of the image (`p` and `q`) and the shape of the cross to maximize this rank.\n\nThe cross `X` is the union of two rectangular shapes: a horizontal one `H_rect` and a vertical one `V_rect`.\n*   `H_rect` occupies a set of rows `I_h` and a set of columns `J_h`.\n*   `V_rect` occupies a set of rows `I_v` and a set of columns `J_v`.\n\nLet's analyze the rows of `B_C`. A row `R_i` of `B_C` is a 1-dimensional vector of `0`s and `1`s. The pattern of `0`s in this vector is determined by which column sets (`J_h` or `J_v`) intersect the cross at that row `i`. There are four distinct types of rows based on the row index `i`:\n1.  `i` is in the row set of the horizontal bar but not the vertical bar (`i ∈ I_h \\ I_v`). The row vector has `0`s at positions `j ∈ J_h`.\n2.  `i` is in the row set of the vertical bar but not the horizontal bar (`i ∈ I_v \\ I_h`). The row vector has `0`s at positions `j ∈ J_v`.\n3.  `i` is in the intersection of both row sets (`i ∈ I_h ∩ I_v`). The row vector has `0`s at positions `j ∈ J_h U J_v`.\n4.  `i` is not in the row set of either bar (`i ∉ I_h U I_v`). The row vector has no `0`s from the cross; it's an all-`1`s vector.\n\nSo, the row space of `B_C` is spanned by at most four distinct vectors. To maximize the rank, we want to see if we can make these four vector types linearly independent. Through a formal algebraic argument (as detailed in the thought process), these four vector types can be shown to be linearly independent if we choose the column sets `J_h` and `J_v` such that all four regions `J_h \\ J_v`, `J_v \\ J_h`, `J_h ∩ J_v`, and the background (columns not in `J_h U J_v`) are non-empty. This is possible if we choose the canton width `q` to be 4 or greater.\n\nSimilarly, we need to have at least one row of each of the four types in our matrix `B_C`. This is possible if we choose the row sets `I_h` and `I_v` such that the four regions `I_h \\ I_v`, `I_v \\ I_h`, `I_h ∩ I_v`, and the background (rows not in `I_h U I_v`) are all non-empty. This can be done if `p` is 4 or greater.\n\nBy choosing a sufficiently high resolution (e.g., `p,q >= 4`), we can construct a matrix `B_C` whose rows are composed of four linearly independent patterns. Thus, the maximal possible rank of `B_C` is 4.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Final Maximal Rank\n\nWe established that `rank(M) = rank(C*) + 1` (assuming `a \\neq 0, a \\neq b`).\nAnd `max(rank(C*)) = max(rank(B_C)) = 4`.\nTherefore, the maximal possible rank of `M` is `4 + 1 = 5`.\n\nLet's check the special cases:\n*   If `a = 0` (red is 0, white is `b`): The matrix `M` would be zero everywhere except for the white canton background. In this case, `rank(M) = rank(C) = rank(b * B_C) = rank(B_C)`. The maximal rank is 4.\n*   If `b = 0` (white is 0, red is `a`): The analysis is slightly different but also yields `rank(M) = rank(B_C) + 1` by performing column operations or by considering the structure of the red-pixel matrix. The maximal rank is `4 + 1 = 5`.\n\nComparing all cases, the highest possible rank is 5.\n\nFinal Answer Summary:\n1.  The problem reduces to finding `rank(B_C) + 1`, where `B_C` is a 0-1 matrix representing the canton's background.\n2.  The rank of `B_C` depends on the number of linearly independent row patterns it contains.\n3.  The cross structure allows for four distinct row patterns.\n4.  These four patterns can be made linearly independent by choosing appropriate dimensions for the image and cross.\n5.  Therefore, `max(rank(B_C)) = 4`.\n6.  The maximal rank of the entire flag matrix is `4 + 1 = 5`.\n\n<<<5>>>"
