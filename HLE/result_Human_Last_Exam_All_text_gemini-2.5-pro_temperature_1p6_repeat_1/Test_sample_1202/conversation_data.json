    "### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Core Question:** The question asks for the most probable evolutionary mechanism that allows duplicated genes to be kept in the genome (retention) and to evolve to be different from one another (divergence). After a gene duplication event, one copy is typically redundant and free from selective pressure, which most often leads to its loss. The question is about the mechanisms that prevent this loss and lead to a stable, diverged state.\n\n2.  **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**\n    *   **A. Gene conversion:** This is a molecular process where one DNA sequence replaces a homologous sequence. In the context of duplicate genes, gene conversion would tend to make the copies identical to each other. This process works against divergence and thus is not the primary mechanism for retaining two *different* copies.\n    *   **B. Pseudogenization:** This is the process by which a gene copy becomes non-functional due to the accumulation of deleterious mutations. While it is a very common fate for a duplicate gene and represents a form of divergence (from functional to non-functional), it is fundamentally a mechanism of gene *loss*, not *retention* of a functional gene. The question asks for a mechanism that explains retention.\n    *   **C. Neofunctionalization:** In this model, one gene copy maintains the original ancestral function, while the other copy accumulates mutations that give it a completely new, beneficial function. This model explains both **retention** (as the original function is preserved and a new beneficial one is added) and **divergence** (the two genes now have different functions). This is a valid and important mechanism.\n    *   **D. Subfunctionalization:** Also known as the Duplication-Degeneration-Complementation (DDC) model. This model posits that the original ancestral gene had multiple distinct functions or complex regulation (e.g., expressed in different tissues). After duplication, each copy accumulates different degenerative mutations, causing each to lose a different sub-function. As a result, both gene copies become essential to perform the complete set of the original ancestral functions. This explains both **retention** (both copies are now necessary) and **divergence** (each copy specializes in a subset of the original functions).\n    *   **E. Adaptive radiation:** This is a macroevolutionary concept describing the rapid diversification of species to fill different ecological niches. While gene duplication can provide the raw genetic material that fuels adaptive radiation, it is not the molecular mechanism itself that governs the fate of individual duplicated genes within a genome.\n\n3.  **Compare the Most Plausible Mechanisms (Neofunctionalization vs. Subfunctionalization):**\n    *   Both neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization are the leading models explaining the retention and divergence of duplicate genes.\n    *   The question asks which is **\"most likely\"**. This requires considering the probability of the events involved.\n    *   The main challenge for a newly duplicated gene is to avoid becoming a pseudogene. For neofunctionalization to occur, a rare, beneficial, gain-of-function mutation must arise before the redundant gene copy is inactivated by much more common deleterious mutations. This is considered a significant evolutionary hurdle.\n    *   Subfunctionalization, on the other hand, relies on relatively common degenerative (loss-of-function) mutations that inactivate different parts of the gene's function (e.g., mutations in tissue-specific regulatory elements). This partitioning process can happen more readily and quickly, providing an immediate selective advantage to keep both copies.\n    *   Because the mutations required for subfunctionalization are thought to be far more common than those required for neofunctionalization, many evolutionary biologists argue that subfunctionalization is a more probable and common initial pathway for preserving duplicated genes from being lost. Once a gene pair is stabilized by subfunctionalization, one of the copies might then be more free to evolve a new function (a combination of sub- and neofunctionalization).\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nGiven that subfunctionalization provides a more immediate and statistically more probable path to avoiding pseudogenization, it is often considered the \"most likely\" mechanism responsible for the widespread retention of duplicate genes seen in eukaryotic genomes. It elegantly solves the problem of how a redundant gene copy is maintained long enough to diverge.\n\n<<<D>>>"
