    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Define the Key Concepts\n\n*   **All-or-Nothing Vaccine:** This type of vaccine confers perfect immunity to a fraction of the vaccinated population, while providing no protection to the remaining fraction.\n    *   Let `VE_s` be the fraction of vaccinated individuals who are fully protected (where 's' stands for susceptibility). Their probability of infection is 0.\n    *   The remaining fraction, `1 - VE_s`, receives no protection and has the same susceptibility to infection as an unvaccinated person.\n*   **Per-Exposure Vaccine Efficacy (`VE_p`):** This measures the reduction in the probability of infection for a vaccinated individual *per single infectious exposure*, compared to an unvaccinated individual.\n*   **Incidence Rate (I):** The rate at which new cases occur in a population over a given time period. We have `I_v` for the vaccinated group and `I_u` for the unvaccinated group.\n*   **Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR):** The ratio of the incidence rate in the vaccinated group to the incidence rate in the unvaccinated group. `IRR = I_v / I_u`.\n*   **Overall Vaccine Efficacy (VE):** In a clinical trial, this is the metric typically calculated. It is estimated as `VE = 1 - IRR`.\n\n### Step 2: Model the Incidence Rate in the Vaccinated Group (`I_v`)\n\nThe vaccinated group is a mix of two sub-populations:\n1.  A fraction `VE_s` is perfectly immune. Their incidence rate is 0.\n2.  A fraction `1 - VE_s` is not immune. Their incidence rate is the same as the unvaccinated group, `I_u`.\n\nThe overall incidence rate in the vaccinated group (`I_v`) is the weighted average of the rates in these two subgroups:\n`I_v = (VE_s * 0) + ((1 - VE_s) * I_u)`\n`I_v = (1 - VE_s) * I_u`\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Estimated Vaccine Efficacy (`1 - IRR`)\n\nNow, we can express the `IRR` in terms of the model parameter `VE_s`:\n`IRR = I_v / I_u`\n`IRR = ((1 - VE_s) * I_u) / I_u`\n`IRR = 1 - VE_s`\n\nThe value we are asked to analyze is `1 - IRR`. Let's calculate it:\n`1 - IRR = 1 - (1 - VE_s) = VE_s`\n\n**Careful Point 1:** For an all-or-nothing vaccine, the standard trial measure of vaccine efficacy (`1 - IRR`) is a direct estimate of `VE_s`, the proportion of the vaccinated population that is rendered completely immune.\n\n### Step 4: Determine the Per-Exposure Efficacy (`VE_p`) in this Model\n\n`VE_p` is defined at the individual level upon exposure. Let's consider the two types of individuals in the vaccinated group:\n1.  For the fraction `VE_s` that is fully protected, their risk of infection per exposure is 0. Their per-exposure efficacy is `VE_p = (Risk_unvac - Risk_vac) / Risk_unvac = (Risk_unvac - 0) / Risk_unvac = 1` (or 100%).\n2.  For the fraction `1 - VE_s` that is not protected, their risk of infection per exposure is the same as an unvaccinated person. Their per-exposure efficacy is `VE_p = (Risk_unvac - Risk_unvac) / Risk_unvac = 0`.\n\n**Careful Point 2:** The \"per-exposure vaccine efficacy\" is not a single value for all individuals in the all-or-nothing model. It is either 1 or 0. The question asks to compare the population estimate (`1 - IRR`) with \"the\" `VE_p`. This implies we should consider the efficacy conferred by the vaccine's mechanism *when it works*. In this context, the per-exposure efficacy of the vaccine's protective effect is `VE_p = 1`.\n\n### Step 5: Compare `1 - IRR` with `VE_p`\n\nWe have established:\n*   The estimated value from the trial is `1 - IRR = VE_s`.\n*   The mechanistic per-exposure efficacy, for those who are protected, is `VE_p = 1`.\n\nNow we compare these two values.\n*   We are comparing `VE_s` to `1`.\n*   `VE_s` is the proportion of people who are protected. Unless the vaccine is 100% effective for every single person who receives it (a case where `VE_s = 1`), `VE_s` will be a value less than 1 (e.g., 0.9 for a 90% effective vaccine).\n*   Therefore, for any vaccine that is not perfectly effective, `VE_s < 1`.\n\nThis leads to the comparison:\n`1 - IRR` (which equals `VE_s`) is less than `VE_p` (which equals 1).\n\n**Conclusion:** The measure `1 - IRR` underestimates the true per-exposure efficacy for the individuals who are actually protected by the all-or-nothing vaccine.\n\n### Final Answer Summary\n\n*   The quantity measured in a trial, `1 - IRR`, estimates the *proportion* of people protected (`VE_s`).\n*   The per-exposure efficacy (`VE_p`) describes the *degree* of protection for those who are successfully vaccinated. For an all-or-nothing vaccine, this degree is 100% (`VE_p = 1`).\n*   Since the proportion of people protected (`VE_s`) will be less than 1 (for any imperfect vaccine), the trial estimate `1 - IRR` will be smaller than the true mechanistic efficacy (`VE_p=1`).\n*   Therefore, `1 - IRR` underestimates the per-exposure vaccine efficacy.\n\n<<<B>>>"
