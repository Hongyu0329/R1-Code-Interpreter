    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core components of the question.**\n*   **Dance Figure:** The \"reverse turn\" is a fundamental figure in all five Standard/Ballroom dances. It is a left-turning figure.\n*   **Action:** \"Overturn\" means to rotate more than the standard, textbook amount prescribed for the figure.\n*   **Constraint:** \"Without disregarding the technique.\" This is the most important part of the question. We must consider the specific, defining technical rules of each dance style, such as footwork, body action (sway, rise and fall), timing, and connection.\n*   **Condition:** \"Impossible.\" This implies that the fundamental technique of one particular dance strictly prohibits overturning a reverse turn, whereas in the other dances it might be stylistically unusual but technically achievable.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze each dance based on its core technique.**\n\n*   **A. Viennese Waltz:** This dance is characterized by continuous rotation. The reverse turn and its variations (like the Reverse Fleckerl) are built for sustained turning. Overturning a basic reverse turn is not only possible but is a natural extension of the dance's character.\n*   **B. English Waltz:** This is a \"swing\" dance with pronounced rise and fall, and body sway. These technical elements (sway and swing) are tools that allow a dancer to generate and control rotation. A skilled dancer can use more sway and a stronger drive to increase the amount of turn in a figure beyond the textbook amount. Therefore, overturning is technically possible.\n*   **D. Slow Foxtrot:** Like the Waltz, this is a smooth, continuous swing dance. It relies on heel leads, body swing, and momentum to travel down the floor. While the rise and fall is flatter than in the Waltz, the principles of swing and CBM (Contrary Body Movement) still apply. These principles can be used to manipulate the amount of rotation, making it possible to overturn a reverse turn.\n*   **E. Quickstep:** This is a dynamic swing dance. It combines the continuous movement of the Foxtrot with faster, more energetic steps. The flexibility in its choreography and its dynamic nature mean that figures are often modified. Overturning a reverse turn to transition into another figure is technically feasible within the style.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the European Tango and identify its unique technical constraints.**\n\n*   **Distinct Technique:** The European Tango is fundamentally different from the four \"swing\" dances listed above. Its key technical characteristics are:\n    *   **No Rise and Fall:** The dance is performed with bent knees, maintaining a constant level.\n    *   **No Sway:** The body posture is strong and held, without the side-to-side sway seen in swing dances.\n    *   **Staccato Action:** Movements are sharp, deliberate, and punctuated.\n    *   **Placement, not Swing:** Feet are picked up and placed decisively. There is no \"swinging\" of the moving leg past the standing leg in the same way as in Waltz or Foxtrot.\n\n*   **The Reverse Turn in Tango:** Let's look at the technique of the man's part in a Tango Reverse Turn.\n    1.  **Step 1:** Left Foot forward, turning left (with CBM).\n    2.  **Step 2:** Right Foot to the side and slightly back. **Crucially, there is no CBM on this step.** The foot is *placed*. This action itself limits the potential for rotation. To overturn, the dancer would have to swing the right foot around, which would violate the \"no swing\" and \"no sway\" principles of Tango.\n    3.  **Step 3:** Left Foot closes to the Right Foot. This closing action is a definitive stop. It \"clips\" the turn.\n\n*   **The \"Impossibility\":** To overturn a Tango Reverse Turn, a dancer would have to introduce a swinging action, use body sway, and ignore the prescribed foot placement (placing the foot to the side). They would also have to abandon the \"closing\" action of the feet. All of these adjustments constitute a fundamental disregard for the core technique of Tango. The figure is constructed in a way that completes a set amount of turn and then stops sharply. Its very design prevents further rotation.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude based on the analysis.**\n\nThe four swing dances (Viennese Waltz, English Waltz, Slow Foxtrot, Quickstep) have technical mechanisms (sway, swing, rise and fall) that allow for the amount of rotation in a figure to be modified. The European Tango, due to its unique staccato, non-swinging technique and specific foot placements, has a Reverse Turn constructed in a way that makes overturning it technically impossible without fundamentally breaking the rules of the dance.\n\n<<<C>>>"
