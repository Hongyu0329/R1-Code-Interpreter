    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which African flags have the same linear algebraic rank as the flag of Denmark.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the Rank of the Flag of Denmark\n\n1.  **Represent the flag as a matrix:** A flag can be viewed as an `m x n` matrix where each entry corresponds to a pixel, and the value of the entry represents the color of that pixel. The flag of Denmark consists of two colors: red and white.\n\n2.  **Interpret \"maximal rank\":** The question states to assume that the values for the colors are chosen to make the rank of the flag's matrix maximal. This is a crucial instruction. Let the colors in a flag be `C_1, C_2, ..., C_k`. We can represent the flag matrix `M` as a linear combination of indicator matrices:\n    `M = v_1 * I_1 + v_2 * I_2 + ... + v_k * I_k`\n    Here, `v_i` is the numerical value assigned to color `C_i`, and `I_i` is an indicator matrix with `1`s where the color is `C_i` and `0`s elsewhere.\n\n3.  **Find the maximal rank:** The set of all possible matrices for a given flag design forms a vector space spanned by the set of its indicator matrices `{I_1, I_2, ..., I_k}`. The rank of the matrix `M` depends on the choice of the scalar values `v_i`. The maximal possible rank for `M` over all possible choices of `{v_i}` is the dimension of the vector space spanned by the indicator matrices.\n    `Maximal Rank = dim(span{I_1, I_2, ..., I_k})`\n\n4.  **Linear independence of indicator matrices:** The indicator matrices for the colors of a single flag are always linearly independent. This is because the regions for each color are disjoint. If we have a linear combination `c_1*I_1 + c_2*I_2 + ... + c_k*I_k = 0` (the zero matrix), then for any pixel in the region of color `C_i`, the equation becomes `c_i * 1 = 0`, which means `c_i` must be zero. Since this is true for every color region, all coefficients `c_1, ..., c_k` must be zero.\n\n5.  **Conclusion on rank:** Since the `k` indicator matrices are linearly independent, the dimension of the space they span is `k`. Therefore, the maximal rank of any flag is equal to the number of distinct colors it contains.\n\n6.  **Rank of Denmark's flag:** The flag of Denmark has two colors (red and white). Therefore, its maximal rank is 2.\n\n### Step 2: Identify African Flags with a Rank of 2\n\nThe problem now simplifies to identifying which national flags of African countries have exactly two colors. We will analyze the flags, including any emblems or symbols they contain.\n\n1.  **Algeria:** Red, white, green. (3 colors)\n2.  **Angola:** Red, black, yellow. (3 colors)\n3.  **Botswana:** Light blue, white, black. (3 colors)\n4.  **Libya:** Red, black, green, white. (4 colors)\n5.  **Morocco:** The flag has a red field with a green pentagram (Seal of Solomon). The colors are **red and green**. (2 colors)\n6.  **Nigeria:** The flag consists of three vertical bands of green, white, and green. The colors are **green and white**. (2 colors)\n7.  **Somalia:** The flag has a light blue field with a white five-pointed star in the center. The colors are **light blue and white**. (2 colors)\n8.  **Tunisia:** The flag has a red field with a white disk in the center, which contains a red star and crescent. The colors used are only **red and white**. (2 colors)\n\nAll other African national flags have three or more colors. For example:\n*   **Egypt:** Red, white, black, and gold (for the Eagle of Saladin). (4 colors)\n*   **Ghana:** Red, yellow, green, and black (for the star). (4 colors)\n*   **Kenya:** Black, red, green, and white. (4 colors)\n*   **South Africa:** Black, yellow, green, white, red, and blue. (6 colors)\n\n### Step 3: Final Answer\n\nThe African nations whose flags have the same linear algebraic rank as the flag of Denmark (a rank of 2) are those with exactly two colors. Based on the analysis, these nations are Morocco, Nigeria, Somalia, and Tunisia.\n\n<<<Morocco, Nigeria, Somalia, Tunisia>>>"
