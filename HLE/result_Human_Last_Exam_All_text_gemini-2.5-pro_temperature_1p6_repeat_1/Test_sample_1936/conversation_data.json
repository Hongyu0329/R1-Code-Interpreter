    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the smallest number $n$ such that there exists a set $G$ with $n$ elements and a binary operation $\\cdot$ for which $(G, \\cdot)$ is not a group.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the definition of a group\n\nA group is a mathematical structure $(G, \\cdot)$ consisting of a set $G$ and a binary operation $\\cdot$ that satisfies the following four axioms:\n1.  **Closure:** For any two elements $a, b \\in G$, their product $a \\cdot b$ is also in $G$. (Note: This is part of the definition of a binary operation, so it is always satisfied if we have a binary operation on $G$.)\n2.  **Associativity:** For any three elements $a, b, c \\in G$, the equation $(a \\cdot b) \\cdot c = a \\cdot (b \\cdot c)$ holds.\n3.  **Identity Element:** There exists an element $e \\in G$, called the identity element, such that for every element $a \\in G$, we have $e \\cdot a = a \\cdot e = a$.\n4.  **Inverse Element:** For each element $a \\in G$, there exists an element $a^{-1} \\in G$, called the inverse of $a$, such that $a \\cdot a^{-1} = a^{-1} \\cdot a = e$.\n\nThe question asks for the smallest size of the set $G$ (the number $n$) for which we can define a binary operation that fails to satisfy at least one of these axioms (specifically, associativity, identity, or inverse, as closure is guaranteed by the definition of a binary operation).\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the smallest possible values for $n$\n\nLet's test values of $n$ starting from the smallest possibilities.\n\n**Careful Point 1: The case of $n=0$**\nIf $n=0$, the set $G$ is the empty set, $G = \\emptyset$. A binary operation is a function from $G \\times G \\to G$. Since $G \\times G = \\emptyset$, there is exactly one such function (the empty function). With this operation, the empty set is not a group because it fails the identity element axiom, which requires the *existence* of an element $e \\in G$. However, in standard mathematical convention, a group is required to be a **non-empty** set. So we will proceed by assuming $n \\geq 1$.\n\n**Careful Point 2: The case of $n=1$**\nLet $G$ be a set with one element, say $G = \\{a\\}$.\n*   **Define the binary operation:** A binary operation on $G$ must define the result of $a \\cdot a$. For the closure axiom to hold, the result must be an element of $G$. Since $a$ is the only element, the operation must be defined as $a \\cdot a = a$. This is the only possible binary operation on a set of size 1.\n*   **Check the group axioms for $(G, \\cdot)$:**\n    1.  **Closure:** It holds, as $a \\cdot a = a \\in G$.\n    2.  **Associativity:** We need to check if $(x \\cdot y) \\cdot z = x \\cdot (y \\cdot z)$ for all $x, y, z \\in G$. Since there is only one element, this means checking $(a \\cdot a) \\cdot a = a \\cdot (a \\cdot a)$.\n        *   Left side: $(a \\cdot a) \\cdot a = a \\cdot a = a$.\n        *   Right side: $a \\cdot (a \\cdot a) = a \\cdot a = a$.\n        Since both sides are equal, associativity holds.\n    3.  **Identity Element:** We need an element $e \\in G$ such that $e \\cdot a = a \\cdot e = a$. Let's try $e=a$. We have $a \\cdot a = a$, so $a$ acts as the identity element. This axiom holds.\n    4.  **Inverse Element:** For each element (only $a$ in this case), we need an inverse. The inverse of $a$ must be an element $x \\in G$ such that $a \\cdot x = e$. Here, $e=a$, so we need $a \\cdot x = a$. The only choice for $x$ is $a$, and indeed, $a \\cdot a = a$. So, $a$ is its own inverse. This axiom holds.\n*   **Conclusion for n=1:** Any set with one element and a binary operation defined on it forms a group (this is called the trivial group). It is impossible to define a binary operation on a set of size 1 that is not a group. Therefore, $n$ must be greater than 1.\n\n**Careful Point 3: The case of $n=2$**\nLet $G$ be a set with two elements, say $G = \\{a, b\\}$. We need to see if it is possible to define a binary operation $\\cdot$ on $G$ that fails to make it a group. We don't need all possible operations to fail, just one. Let's try to construct one.\n*   **Define a binary operation:** Let's define the operation with a Cayley table. We can try to make one of the axioms fail deliberately. Let's try to fail the identity element axiom.\n    Consider the operation where every product is equal to the first element: $x \\cdot y = x$.\n    The Cayley table for this operation is:\n| $\\cdot$ | $a$ | $b$ |\n| :---: |:-:|:-:|\n|  $a$  | $a$ | $a$ |\n|  $b$  | $b$ | $b$ |\n*   **Check the group axioms:**\n    1.  **Closure:** All entries in the table ($a$ and $b$) are in the set $G$. Closure holds.\n    2.  **Associativity:** Let's check: $(x \\cdot y) \\cdot z = x \\cdot z = x$. And $x \\cdot (y \\cdot z) = x \\cdot y = x$. So associativity holds. This structure is a semigroup.\n    3.  **Identity Element:** We need an element $e \\in G$ such that for all $x \\in G$, $e \\cdot x = x \\cdot e = x$.\n        *   Let's test if $e=a$ is the identity. We need $a \\cdot x = x$ for all $x$. Let's test $x=b$. We need $a \\cdot b = b$. But from our table, $a \\cdot b = a$. So $a$ is not the identity element.\n        *   Let's test if $e=b$ is the identity. We need $b \\cdot x = x$ for all $x$. Let's test $x=a$. We need $b \\cdot a = a$. But from our table, $b \\cdot a = b$. So $b$ is not the identity element.\n    Since neither element can be the identity, this structure has no identity element. Therefore, the identity axiom fails.\n*   **Conclusion for n=2:** Since we have found a binary operation on a set of 2 elements for which the structure is not a group, it is possible for $n=2$.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nWe have established the following:\n*   For $n=1$, any binary operation on a set of this size must result in a group.\n*   For $n=2$, we successfully constructed an example of a binary operation on a set of this size that does not result in a group.\n\nTherefore, the smallest number $n$ for which this is possible is 2.\n\n<<<2>>>"
