The leading-order behavior of the generating function H(s,s') in the limit as the arc-length separation |s′−s| approaches zero is characterized by the asymptotic expansion:
$H(s, s') = |s' - s| - \frac{1}{24}\kappa(s)^2|s' - s|^3 + O(|s' - s|^4)$
Here, the dominant term, $|s' - s|$, represents the chord length in the absence of curvature, while the leading correction term, which is cubic in the separation, incorporates the influence of the local boundary curvature $\kappa(s)$. This term demonstrates that the curvature reduces the chord length relative to the arc length and is fundamental to the dynamics of grazing billiard trajectories.
