    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of pirouettes performed by Natalia Osipova in the specified performance.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Performance and Variation**\nThe question refers to Natalia Osipova's performance as Kitri in the Bolshoi Ballet's 2008 production of *Don Quixote*. We need to analyze her solo variation in Act I, which is one of the most famous and technically demanding pieces for the character.\n\n**Step 2: Define the Specific Ballet Step**\nThe question asks for the number of \"single-turn pirouette en dehors from the fifth position.\"\n*   **Pirouette:** A full turn performed on one leg.\n*   **Single-turn:** The turn consists of exactly one 360-degree rotation.\n*   **En dehors:** The turn is executed \"outward,\" away from the supporting leg. This is the standard direction for this type of pirouette.\n*   **From the fifth position:** The turn is initiated from a preparation where the feet are in a closed position (fifth position, or a tight fourth which functions similarly as a preparation).\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Choreography of the Act I Variation**\nKitri's Act I variation features several distinct technical sequences. We must identify the specific sequence that matches the description. While she performs other turns like piqué turns on a diagonal, these do not start from a fifth position. The most recognizable sequence that fits the criteria is a diagonal combination involving high kicks.\n\n**Step 4: Locate the Correct Sequence in the Performance**\nWithin the variation, there is a famous and defining sequence where Osipova travels along a diagonal. The step combination is a *grand battement jeté* (a high, sharp kick often called a \"fan kick\" in this context) which lands in a deep *plié* (bend of the knees) in a closed position, immediately followed by a sharp, single *pirouette en dehors*. This combination perfectly matches the question's description.\n\n**Step 5: Count the Repetitions**\nBy carefully observing videos of Natalia Osipova's 2008 Bolshoi performance, we can count the number of times she executes this specific fan kick-pirouette combination. She performs this sequence repeatedly while traveling across the stage.\n\n*   She begins the sequence.\n*   Performs the 1st combination (kick and single pirouette).\n*   Performs the 2nd combination.\n*   Performs the 3rd combination.\n*   Performs the 4th combination.\n*   Performs the 5th combination.\n*   Performs the 6th combination.\n*   Performs the 7th combination.\n*   Performs the 8th combination.\n\nAfter the eighth repetition, the choreography changes as she prepares for the final pose of the variation.\n\n**Step 6: Final Conclusion**\nBased on the analysis of the standard choreography and direct observation of Osipova's 2008 performance, she performs the described combination of a kick followed by a single pirouette en dehors from a fifth/closed position a total of eight times in her Act I variation.\n\n<<<8>>>"
