    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of Configuration State Functions (CSFs) for a full Configuration Interaction (CI) calculation of $\\mathrm{CH}_2 \\mathrm{SiHF}$ using the 6-31G** basis set.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Determine the Number of Electrons ($N_e$)**\n\nThe number of electrons in a neutral molecule is the sum of the atomic numbers of its constituent atoms.\nThe molecule is $\\mathrm{CH}_2 \\mathrm{SiHF}$.\n*   Carbon (C): Atomic number = 6\n*   Hydrogen (H): Atomic number = 1 (there are 3 H atoms in total)\n*   Silicon (Si): Atomic number = 14\n*   Fluorine (F): Atomic number = 9\n\nTotal number of electrons $N_e = 6 + (3 \\times 1) + 14 + 9 = 32$.\nThe molecule has an even number of electrons and is expected to have a singlet ground state (Total Spin S=0). For a singlet calculation, the number of spin-up electrons ($N_\\alpha$) equals the number of spin-down electrons ($N_\\beta$).\n$N_\\alpha = N_\\beta = N_e / 2 = 32 / 2 = 16$.\n\n**2. Determine the Number of Basis Functions (Spatial Orbitals, $K$)**\n\nThe number of molecular orbitals ($K$) in a calculation is equal to the total number of basis functions contributed by the atoms. The basis set is 6-31G**.\n\n*   **Basis Set Notation**:\n    *   `6-31G`: A split-valence basis set. Core orbitals are represented by one contracted function (from 6 primitives). Valence orbitals are split into an inner part (contracted from 3 primitives) and an outer part (1 primitive).\n    *   `**` (also denoted as `(d,p)`): This indicates the addition of polarization functions.\n        *   A set of d-type functions is added to each heavy (non-hydrogen) atom. By default in most quantum chemistry software, this means 6 Cartesian d-functions ($d_{xx}, d_{yy}, d_{zz}, d_{xy}, d_{xz}, d_{yz}$).\n        *   A set of p-type functions is added to each hydrogen atom (3 functions: $p_x, p_y, p_z$).\n\n*   **Counting Basis Functions per Atom:**\n    *   **Hydrogen (H)**:\n        *   6-31G splits the 1s valence orbital into two s-type basis functions.\n        *   The `**` adds one set of p-functions (3 functions).\n        *   Total for H = 2 (s) + 3 (p) = 5 basis functions.\n    *   **Carbon (C)** (a 2nd-period heavy atom):\n        *   6-31G provides: 1s (core) + 2s (split valence) + 2p (split valence) -> 1 + 2 + (2*3) = 9 basis functions.\n        *   The `**` adds one set of d-functions (6 functions).\n        *   Total for C = 9 + 6 = 15 basis functions.\n    *   **Fluorine (F)** (a 2nd-period heavy atom):\n        *   Same as Carbon. Total for F = 15 basis functions.\n    *   **Silicon (Si)** (a 3rd-period heavy atom):\n        *   6-31G provides: (1s, 2s, 2p core) + 3s (split valence) + 3p (split valence) -> (1+1+3) + 2 + (2*3) = 5 + 2 + 6 = 13 basis functions.\n        *   The `**` adds one set of d-functions (6 functions).\n        *   Total for Si = 13 + 6 = 19 basis functions.\n\n*   **Total Number of Basis Functions ($K$):**\n    *   $K = (\\text{funcs for C}) + 3 \\times (\\text{funcs for H}) + (\\text{funcs for Si}) + (\\text{funcs for F})$\n    *   $K = 15 + (3 \\times 5) + 19 + 15$\n    *   $K = 15 + 15 + 19 + 15 = 64$\n\n**3. The Formula for the Number of Singlet CSFs**\n\nFor a full CI calculation with $K$ spatial orbitals and $N_e$ electrons, the number of CSFs for a singlet state (S=0) is given by the Weyl-Paldus formula:\n$N_{CSF}(S=0) = \\frac{2S+1}{K+1} \\binom{K+1}{N_e/2 - S} \\binom{K+1}{N_e/2 + S + 1}$\nFor S=0, this simplifies to:\n$N_{CSF} = \\frac{1}{K+1} \\binom{K+1}{N_e/2} \\binom{K+1}{N_e/2 + 1}$\n\n**Careful Point:** There is another common formula for the number of singlet CSFs: $N_{CSF} = \\binom{K}{N_e/2}^2 - \\binom{K}{N_e/2-1} \\binom{K}{N_e/2+1}$. Although algebraically equivalent, this formula can be numerically unstable when calculating with very large numbers, as it involves the subtraction of two very large, nearly equal numbers. It is safer to use the Weyl-Paldus formula directly.\n\n**4. Calculation**\n\nSubstitute the determined values of $K$ and $N_e$ into the Weyl-Paldus formula:\n*   $K = 64$\n*   $N_e = 32$, so $N_e/2 = 16$\n\n$N_{CSF} = \\frac{1}{64+1} \\binom{64+1}{16} \\binom{64+1}{16 + 1}$\n$N_{CSF} = \\frac{1}{65} \\binom{65}{16} \\binom{65}{17}$\n\nNow we need to calculate the binomial coefficients:\n*   $\\binom{65}{16} = \\frac{65!}{16!49!} = 6,703,137,209,726,975$\n*   $\\binom{65}{17} = \\frac{65!}{17!48!} = 19,715,109,439,320,525$\n\nMultiply these two numbers and divide by 65:\n$N_{CSF} = \\frac{1}{65} \\times (6,703,137,209,726,975) \\times (19,715,109,439,320,525)$\n$N_{CSF} = \\frac{132,156,793,024,198,391,194,543,623,125}{65}$\n$N_{CSF} = 2,033,181,431,141,513,710,685,286,509$\n\nThe number of CSFs is approximately $2.033 \\times 10^{27}$.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n<<<2033181431141513710685286509>>>"
