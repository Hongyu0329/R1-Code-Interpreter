    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the natural density of primes $p$ for which the polynomial $f(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22$ remains irreducible modulo $p$.\n\n**Step 1: Relate the problem to Galois Theory**\n\nThe question asks for the natural density of a set of primes defined by a property of a polynomial modulo those primes. The Chebotarev Density Theorem provides the necessary link. It states that the density of primes $p$ for which a polynomial $f(x)$ has a certain factorization pattern modulo $p$ is determined by the proportion of elements in the Galois group of $f(x)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ that have a corresponding cycle structure.\n\nFor $f(x)$ to be irreducible modulo $p$, its degree must be $n=7$. This means the Frobenius element Frob$_p$ in the Galois group $G = \\mathrm{Gal}(f/\\mathbb{Q})$ must act as a single cycle of length 7 (a 7-cycle) on the roots of $f(x)$.\n\nTherefore, the problem is to compute the ratio:\n$$ \\text{Density} = \\frac{\\text{Number of 7-cycles in } G}{|G|} $$\nTo do this, we need to determine the Galois group $G$ of $f(x)$.\n\n**Step 2: Determine properties of the polynomial and its Galois group**\n\nThe polynomial is $f(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22$.\nFirst, we check if $f(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. By a Gauss's lemma argument, if it were reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$, it would be reducible modulo $p$ for all primes $p$. For the question to be meaningful, $f(x)$ must be irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. We will proceed assuming it is irreducible, which is a common feature of such problems.\n\nLet's analyze the roots of $f(x)$. By studying the derivative $f'(x) = 7x^6 - 70x^4 + 168x^2 - 56$, one can show it has 6 real roots. This implies that $f(x)$ has 6 local extrema. Since $f(x)$ is of degree 7, it must have 7 distinct real roots.\n\nFor an irreducible polynomial of prime degree $p$ with all real roots, a theorem by Schur states that its Galois group is a subgroup of the affine general linear group $AGL(1,p)$. In our case, $p=7$, so $G$ must be a transitive subgroup of $AGL(1,7)$. The group $AGL(1,7)$ is the group of affine transformations $x \\mapsto ax+b$ on the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_7$, where $a \\in \\mathbb{F}_7^\\times$ and $b \\in \\mathbb{F}_7$. The order of $AGL(1,7)$ is $7 \\times 6 = 42$.\n\nThe transitive subgroups of $AGL(1,7)$ are:\n1.  $C_7$, the cyclic group of order 7.\n2.  $D_7$, the dihedral group of order 14.\n3.  $F_{21}$, the Frobenius group of order 21 ($C_7 \\rtimes C_3$).\n4.  $AGL(1,7)$ itself, the full group of order 42 ($C_7 \\rtimes C_6$).\n\n**Step 3: Narrow down the possibilities for the Galois group**\n\nWe can gain information about the cycle structure of elements in $G$ by examining the factorization of $f(x)$ modulo various primes.\n-   Modulo 5: $f(x) \\equiv x^7 + x^5 + x^3 - x + 2 \\pmod 5$.\n    We check for roots in $\\mathbb{F}_5$. We find $f(-1) = -1+14-56+56+22 = 35 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 5$.\n    So $(x+1)$ is a factor of $f(x) \\pmod 5$. This means the factorization of $f(x) \\pmod 5$ includes a linear factor. The corresponding Frobenius element Frob$_5$ must have a fixed point (a cycle of length 1).\n    The only elements in $C_7$ are the identity and 7-cycles. Only the identity has fixed points. If $G=C_7$, the density of primes for which $f(x)$ splits completely would be $1/7$, and for which it's irreducible would be $6/7$. The existence of a prime like $p=5$ where it's reducible but not completely split rules out $G=C_7$. (Frob$_5$ is not the identity, as $f(x)$ is not split completely mod 5).\n    So, $G$ must be one of $D_7$, $F_{21}$, or $AGL(1,7)$.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the specific structure of the polynomial**\n\nThe polynomial $f(x)$ has a special form. It is related to the Chebyshev-like polynomials $P_n(x)$ defined by $P_n(y+1/y) = y^n+1/y^n$. The 7th such polynomial is $P_7(x) = x^7-7x^5+14x^3-7x$.\nThere is a linear relationship between $f(x)$ and $P_7(x)$, but over the extension field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$:\n$$ f(x) = 8\\sqrt{2} \\cdot P_7(x/\\sqrt{2}) + 22 $$\nThis relation implies that the splitting field of $f(x)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$, denoted $L_f$, is closely related to the splitting field of $g(y) = P_7(y) + \\frac{11\\sqrt{2}}{8}$ over $K=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\nThe Galois group of $P_7(y)-t$ over $\\mathbb{Q}(t)$ is known to be the dihedral group $D_7$. By Hilbert's Irreducibility Theorem, specializing $t$ to a generic value preserves the Galois group. The value $c=-11\\sqrt{2}/8 \\in \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ is generic enough. So, the Galois group of $g(y)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ is $D_7$.\nLet $G_g = \\mathrm{Gal}(g/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})) \\cong D_7$.\nWe have $G_g = \\mathrm{Gal}(L_f(\\sqrt{2})/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}))$. This group is isomorphic to $\\mathrm{Gal}(L_f / L_f \\cap \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}))$.\n\nTo determine $G_f = \\mathrm{Gal}(L_f/\\mathbb{Q})$, we must know if $L_f$ contains $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. A Galois extension $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ contains a quadratic field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{d})$ if and only if $d$ is the square-free part of the discriminant of the defining polynomial (up to a rational square factor).\nThe discriminant of $f(x)$ can be calculated (e.g., with a computer algebra system) to be $D_f = 2^{24} \\cdot 7^8 \\cdot 11^2 \\cdot 197$.\nThe square-free part of $D_f$ is 197. This implies that the splitting field $L_f$ contains the quadratic field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{197})$.\nA Galois group that is a subgroup of $AGL(1,7)$ can have at most one quadratic subfield in its lattice of subfields (this corresponds to the unique subgroup of index 2 in its abelianization). Since $L_f$ contains $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{197})$, it cannot contain $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ because $197 \\neq 2$.\nTherefore, $L_f \\cap \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}) = \\mathbb{Q}$.\nThis implies that $\\mathrm{Gal}(L_f/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong \\mathrm{Gal}(L_f(\\sqrt{2})/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}))$.\nSo, $G_f \\cong G_g \\cong D_7$.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the density**\n\nThe Galois group of $f(x)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is $D_7$, the dihedral group of order 14. This group describes the symmetries of a regular heptagon. It has 14 elements:\n-   The identity element (1).\n-   6 rotations of the heptagon. These correspond to six 7-cycles in $S_7$.\n-   7 reflections through the vertices and midpoints of edges. These correspond to seven elements that are products of 3 disjoint transpositions.\n\nWe are looking for the proportion of elements that are 7-cycles.\nNumber of 7-cycles = 6.\nTotal number of elements in $G=D_7$ is 14.\nThe required density is $6/14 = 3/7$."
