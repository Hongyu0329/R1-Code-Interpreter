    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem Statement\n\nLet `S` be the unit square, `S = [0,1] x [0,1]`. We are given two subsets of the plane, `A` and `B`, with the following properties:\n1.  `A` is a closed set.\n2.  `B` is a closed set.\n3.  `A` is a connected set.\n4.  `B` is a connected set.\n5.  The union of `A` and `B` is the unit square: `A ∪ B = S`.\n\nThe goal is to find the largest possible number of connected components of the intersection of these two sets, `A ∩ B`.\n\n### Step 2: Listing Careful Points and Initial Analysis\n\n*   **Intersection is Closed:** Since `A` and `B` are closed sets, their intersection `C = A ∩ B` is also a closed set.\n*   **Simple Cases:** Let's construct some simple examples to see what numbers of components are possible.\n    *   **One Component:** Let `A` be the left half of the square, `A = [0, 1/2] x [0,1]`, and `B` be the right half, `B = [1/2, 1] x [0,1]`. Both `A` and `B` are closed and connected, and their union is `S`. Their intersection is the line segment `{1/2} x [0,1]`, which has **one** connected component. So, 1 is a possible answer.\n    *   **Checkerboard Pattern:** Consider a `2x2` checkerboard. Let `A` be the union of the two diagonal squares, `A = ([0,1/2]x[0,1/2]) ∪ ([1/2,1]x[1/2,1])`. Let `B` be the union of the other two squares. Both `A` and `B` are connected as they touch at the center point `(1/2, 1/2)`. Their intersection `A ∩ B` is the union of the two line segments `[0,1]x{1/2}` and `{1/2}x[0,1]`, which forms a `+` shape. This is also **one** connected component.\n\n### Step 3: Deeper Topological Analysis\n\nThe simple examples suggest the answer might be 1. Let's see if we can prove this or find a counterexample.\n\n*   **Key Idea from Topology:** A relevant theorem (a variation of Kuratowski's theorem) states that if `S` is the union of two closed connected sets `A` and `B`, and if the sets `A \\ B` and `B \\ A` are both connected, then their intersection `A ∩ B` must be connected.\n*   **Path to Multiple Components:** This theorem gives us a crucial insight: to obtain an intersection `A ∩ B` with more than one component, it must be the case that either `A \\ B` or `B \\ A` (or both) is a disconnected set.\n*   **Attempting a Construction with 2 Components:** Let's try to construct an example where `A ∩ B` has two components.\n    1.  Let's wish for the intersection `C = A ∩ B` to be two disjoint vertical line segments, `C_1 = {1/3}x[0,1]` and `C_2 = {2/3}x[0,1]`.\n    2.  The rest of the square, `S \\ C`, consists of three open vertical strips. Let's call them `R_left`, `R_middle`, and `R_right`.\n    3.  `S \\ C` must be partitioned into `A \\ B` and `B \\ A`. Let's try assigning the middle strip to `A` and the outer strips to `B`.\n        *   `A \\ B = R_middle`\n        *   `B \\ A = R_left ∪ R_right`\n    4.  Now, let's define `A` and `B`:\n        *   `A = (A \\ B) ∪ C = R_middle ∪ C_1 ∪ C_2`. The closure of this set is the closed middle strip `[1/3, 2/3]x[0,1]`. This set is connected.\n        *   `B = (B \\ A) ∪ C = (R_left ∪ R_right) ∪ C_1 ∪ C_2`. The closure of this set is `([0,1/3]x[0,1]) ∪ ([2/3,1]x[0,1])`. This set is **not connected**; it has two separate rectangular components.\n    5.  Our construction failed because `B` must be connected. To make `B` connected, we would need to add a \"bridge\" connecting its two components. This bridge would have to pass through the middle strip, `R_middle`. But `R_middle` belongs to `A \\ B`, meaning its points cannot be in `B`. This seems to lead to a contradiction.\n\n### Step 4: The Role of \"Wild\" Sets and the Final Answer\n\nThe apparent contradiction in Step 3 arises from an implicit assumption that our sets and the \"bridges\" are \"tame\" (e.g., simple lines, polygons, locally connected sets). The argument holds for such tame sets.\n\nHowever, the problem statement does not require `A` and `B` to be locally connected. This allows for the existence of \"wild\" sets, such as continua that resemble the topologist's sine curve or have fractal-like boundaries (like the Lakes of Wada).\n\n*   **If A and B were locally connected:** If the problem had the additional constraint that A and B must be locally connected, then the argument in Step 3 would hold, and the intersection `A ∩ B` would have to be connected. The answer would be 1.\n\n*   **Without the local connectivity constraint:** The problem as stated has a surprising answer. It is a known, though counter-intuitive, result in topology. In a 1951 paper, O. G. Harrold showed that it's possible to construct two closed, connected sets `A` and `B` whose union is the square, such that their intersection `A ∩ B` has **any arbitrary finite number of components** (`n = 1, 2, 3, ...`). He also showed it's possible for the intersection to have a countably infinite number of components. The construction involves intricate, non-locally connected sets.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nSince it is possible to construct examples where the intersection has `n` components for any positive integer `n`, there is no finite upper bound on the number of components. Therefore, there is no \"largest number\" in the typical sense. When asked for the largest possible number in such a scenario, the answer signifies that there is no finite limit.\n\n<<<infinity>>>"
