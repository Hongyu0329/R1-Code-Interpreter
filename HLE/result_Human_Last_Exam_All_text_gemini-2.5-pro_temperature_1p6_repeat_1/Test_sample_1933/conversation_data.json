    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the VC dimension of $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$ where $S$ is a schema with 4 unary predicates.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the structure of the formulas\nThe schema $S$ contains 4 unary predicates, let's call them $P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4$. The logic fragment $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$ allows for formulas built from atomic formulas of the form $P_i(v)$ (where $v$ is a variable) using only existential quantifiers ($\\exists$), conjunctions ($\\land$), and the constants true ($\\top$) and false ($\\bot$).\n\nWe are interested in the VC dimension of the concept class defined by formulas with one free variable, say $x$. A formula $\\phi(x)$ defines a concept, which is the set of elements $a$ in a model's domain for which $\\phi(a)$ is true.\n\nLet's analyze the general form of a formula $\\phi(x)$ in this fragment.\n1.  **Atomic formulas**: The basic building blocks with free variable $x$ are $P_1(x), P_2(x), P_3(x), P_4(x)$.\n2.  **Conjunction**: A formula can be a conjunction of subformulas, e.g., $\\psi_1(x) \\land \\psi_2(x)$.\n3.  **Existential Quantification**: A formula can be of the form $\\exists y (\\psi(x, y))$. Since all predicates are unary, the atomic formulas inside $\\psi$ can only be of the form $P_i(x)$ or $P_j(y)$. This means that any quantifier-free part of the formula $\\psi(x,y)$ can be separated into a part that only involves $x$ and a part that only involves $y$.\n    For example, consider $\\exists y (P_1(x) \\land P_2(y))$. This is logically equivalent to $P_1(x) \\land (\\exists y P_2(y))$.\n    The subformula $\\exists y P_2(y)$ is a sentence (it has no free variables). For any given model (an interpretation of the predicates on a domain), this sentence is either true or false.\n    *   If $\\exists y P_2(y)$ is true in the model, the formula simplifies to $P_1(x) \\land \\top$, which is equivalent to $P_1(x)$.\n    *   If $\\exists y P_2(y)$ is false, the formula simplifies to $P_1(x) \\land \\bot$, which is equivalent to $\\bot$.\n\nThis reasoning extends to any formula in the fragment. Any formula $\\phi(x)$ can be shown by structural induction to be equivalent (in any given model) to one of the following simple forms:\n*   $\\top$ (the 'true' formula, defining the entire domain)\n*   $\\bot$ (the 'false' formula, defining the empty set)\n*   A pure conjunction of atomic formulas involving $x$: $\\bigwedge_{i \\in I} P_i(x)$ for some non-empty index set $I \\subseteq \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$.\n\nThis means that the concept class defined by this logic consists of sets that can be formed by intersecting the sets defined by the base predicates $\\{P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4\\}$. Such a concept class is known as the class of **monotone conjunctions**.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the VC dimension of monotone conjunctions\nWe need to find the VC dimension of the class of concepts formed by monotone conjunctions over $k=4$ base predicates/features. Let the base concepts (the interpretations of the predicates) be $C_1, C_2, C_3, C_4$. The hypothesis class $H$ consists of all sets that can be expressed as $\\bigcap_{i \\in I} C_i$ for some $I \\subseteq \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$. (This includes the whole domain for $I=\\emptyset$ and potentially the empty set for some non-empty $I$).\n\nThe VC dimension is the size of the largest set $X$ that can be shattered by $H$. A set $X$ is shattered if for every subset $Y \\subseteq X$, there exists a hypothesis $h \\in H$ such that $h \\cap X = Y$. To find the VC dimension, we need to find the maximum $d$ such that there *exists* a model that allows us to shatter a set of size $d$.\n\n**Part A: Show VC dimension is at least 4 (VC-dim $\\ge 4$)**\nWe need to show that it is possible to shatter a set of size 4. Let $X = \\{x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4\\}$. We need to construct a model (i.e., define the base sets $C_1, C_2, C_3, C_4$ on the domain $X$) such that we can generate all $2^4 = 16$ subsets of $X$ through intersection.\n\nLet's define the membership of the elements of $X$ in the base sets $C_i$ as follows:\n*   $x_1 \\in C_i \\iff i \\neq 1$. So $x_1$ has the feature vector $(0, 1, 1, 1)$.\n*   $x_2 \\in C_i \\iff i \\neq 2$. So $x_2$ has the feature vector $(1, 0, 1, 1)$.\n*   $x_3 \\in C_i \\iff i \\neq 3$. So $x_3$ has the feature vector $(1, 1, 0, 1)$.\n*   $x_4 \\in C_i \\iff i \\neq 4$. So $x_4$ has the feature vector $(1, 1, 1, 0)$.\n\nNow, to generate an arbitrary subset $Y \\subseteq X$, let's choose our hypothesis. Let $I_Y = \\{j \\mid x_j \\notin Y\\}$. We propose the hypothesis $h_Y = \\bigcap_{j \\in I_Y} C_j$. Let's verify that this works.\n\nAn element $x_k \\in X$ belongs to $h_Y$ if and only if $x_k \\in C_j$ for all $j \\in I_Y$.\nBy our construction, $x_k \\in C_j$ if and only if $k \\neq j$.\nSo, $x_k \\in h_Y$ if and only if $k \\neq j$ for all $j \\in I_Y$.\nThis is equivalent to saying $k \\notin I_Y$.\nBy definition of $I_Y$, $k \\notin I_Y$ if and only if $x_k \\in Y$.\nThus, $h_Y \\cap X = Y$. Since this works for any subset $Y \\subseteq X$, we have successfully shattered the set $X$ of size 4.\nThis proves that VC-dim $\\ge 4$.\n\n**Part B: Show VC dimension is at most 4 (VC-dim $\\le 4$)**\nWe now show that no set of size 5 can be shattered. Let $X = \\{x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5\\}$ be any set of 5 points. Let the base concepts be $C_1, C_2, C_3, C_4$.\n\nTo shatter $X$, for each element $x_j \\in X$, we must be able to generate the subset $X \\setminus \\{x_j\\}$. Let's call this subset $Y_j$. There must exist a hypothesis $h_j = \\bigcap_{i \\in I_j} C_i$ that realizes $Y_j$.\nThis means:\n1.  For all $x_m$ where $m \\neq j$, $x_m \\in h_j$. This implies $x_m \\in C_i$ for all $i \\in I_j$.\n2.  $x_j \\notin h_j$. This implies there must exist at least one index $i_j \\in I_j$ such that $x_j \\notin C_{i_j}$.\n\nFrom these two conditions, it follows that for each $x_j \\in X$, we can find a base concept $C_{i_j}$ such that $x_j \\notin C_{i_j}$ while $x_m \\in C_{i_j}$ for all $m \\neq j$. This base concept $C_{i_j}$ \"separates\" $x_j$ from the rest of $X$.\n\nLet's check if two different points, say $x_j$ and $x_k$ (where $j \\neq k$), can be separated by the same base concept. Suppose $C_l$ separates $x_j$ from $X \\setminus \\{x_j\\}$ and also separates $x_k$ from $X \\setminus \\{x_k\\}$.\n*   From separating $x_j$, we have $x_j \\notin C_l$ and $x_k \\in C_l$ (since $k \\neq j$).\n*   From separating $x_k$, we have $x_k \\notin C_l$ and $x_j \\in C_l$ (since $j \\neq k$).\nThis is a contradiction: $x_k$ cannot both be in $C_l$ and not in $C_l$. Therefore, each point $x_j \\in X$ must be separated by a *unique* base concept from the set $\\{C_1, C_2, C_3, C_4\\}$.\n\nThis implies that there must be at least as many base concepts as there are points in $X$. Since we have a set $X$ of size 5 and only 4 base concepts, there are not enough unique concepts to separate each point. Therefore, a set of size 5 cannot be shattered.\nThis proves that VC-dim $< 5$, so VC-dim $\\le 4$.\n\nAlternatively, a simpler counting argument shows the same upper bound. The number of distinct hypotheses generated by conjunctions over 4 predicates is at most $2^4=16$. To shatter a set of size $d=5$, we need to realize $2^5=32$ distinct subsets. Since $16 < 32$, this is impossible.\n\n### Step 3: Conclusion\nFrom Part A, we have VC-dim $\\ge 4$.\nFrom Part B, we have VC-dim $\\le 4$.\nCombining these, the VC dimension must be exactly 4."
