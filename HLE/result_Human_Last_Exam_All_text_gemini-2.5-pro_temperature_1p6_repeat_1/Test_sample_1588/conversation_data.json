    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of nonzero coefficients of order 10 in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) expansion.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) Formula\nThe BCH formula provides an expression for `Z` where `e^Z = e^X e^Y` for non-commuting operators `X` and `Y`. The formula is an infinite series:\n`Z = log(e^X e^Y) = X + Y + C_2(X,Y) + C_3(X,Y) + ... + C_n(X,Y) + ...`\nEach term `C_n(X,Y)` is a homogeneous polynomial of degree `n` composed of nested commutators of `X` and `Y`. For example:\n*   `C_1(X,Y) = X + Y`\n*   `C_2(X,Y) = 1/2 [X, Y]`\n*   `C_3(X,Y) = 1/12 [X, [X, Y]] - 1/12 [Y, [X, Y]]`\n\nThe \"order\" of a term corresponds to its total degree `n` (the sum of the number of `X`'s and `Y`'s). We are interested in the terms of order 10, i.e., `C_{10}(X,Y)`.\n\n### Step 2: Relate the Problem to Free Lie Algebras\nThe terms `C_n(X,Y)` in the BCH expansion are elements of the free Lie algebra generated by two elements, `X` and `Y`, which we denote as `L(X,Y)`. This algebra can be decomposed into subspaces of homogeneous polynomials of degree `n`, denoted `L_n(X,Y)`.\n`L(X,Y) = L_1(X,Y) ⊕ L_2(X,Y) ⊕ L_3(X,Y) ⊕ ...`\nThe term `C_n(X,Y)` belongs to the subspace `L_n(X,Y)`.\n\nThe \"number of nonzero coefficients\" of a certain order is interpreted as the number of linearly independent terms required to express the component of that order. This is equivalent to finding the dimension of the vector space `L_n(X,Y)`. This interpretation relies on the fact that the specific BCH term `C_n(X,Y)` is a \"full\" element of `L_n(X,Y)`, meaning that when expressed in a standard basis (like a Hall basis or Lyndon basis), all coefficients are non-zero. This is a known, non-trivial result in the theory of Lie algebras.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding the dimension of `L_{10}(X,Y)`.\n\n### Step 3: Use Witt's Formula to Calculate the Dimension\nThe dimension of the `n`-th homogeneous component of the free Lie algebra on `k` generators, `dim(L_n(k))`, is given by Ernst Witt's formula:\n`dim(L_n(k)) = (1/n) * Σ_{d|n} μ(d) * k^(n/d)`\nwhere:\n*   `n` is the degree (order), which is 10 in our case.\n*   `k` is the number of generators (`X` and `Y`), so `k=2`.\n*   The sum is over all positive divisors `d` of `n`.\n*   `μ(d)` is the Möbius function.\n\n### Step 4: Apply Witt's Formula for n=10, k=2\n\n1.  **Identify parameters:**\n    *   `n = 10`\n    *   `k = 2`\n\n2.  **Find the divisors of n=10:**\n    *   The divisors `d` are `1, 2, 5, 10`.\n\n3.  **Calculate the values of the Möbius function `μ(d)` for these divisors:**\n    *   `μ(1) = 1`\n    *   `μ(2) = -1` (since 2 is a single prime)\n    *   `μ(5) = -1` (since 5 is a single prime)\n    *   `μ(10) = μ(2 * 5) = μ(2) * μ(5) = (-1) * (-1) = 1` (since 10 is a product of two distinct primes)\n\n4.  **Substitute these values into Witt's formula:**\n    `dim(L_{10}(2)) = (1/10) * [μ(1) * 2^(10/1) + μ(2) * 2^(10/2) + μ(5) * 2^(10/5) + μ(10) * 2^(10/10)]`\n    `dim(L_{10}(2)) = (1/10) * [1 * 2^10 + (-1) * 2^5 + (-1) * 2^2 + 1 * 2^1]`\n\n5.  **Perform the calculation:**\n    `dim(L_{10}(2)) = (1/10) * [1 * 1024 - 1 * 32 - 1 * 4 + 1 * 2]`\n    `dim(L_{10}(2)) = (1/10) * [1024 - 32 - 4 + 2]`\n    `dim(L_{10}(2)) = (1/10) * [992 - 4 + 2]`\n    `dim(L_{10}(2)) = (1/10) * [988 + 2]`\n    `dim(L_{10}(2)) = (1/10) * [990]`\n    `dim(L_{10}(2)) = 99`\n\n### Conclusion\nThe dimension of the space of homogeneous Lie polynomials of degree 10 in two variables is 99. This corresponds to the number of linearly independent terms, and therefore the number of non-zero coefficients, in the order-10 part of the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff expansion.\n\n<<<99>>>"
