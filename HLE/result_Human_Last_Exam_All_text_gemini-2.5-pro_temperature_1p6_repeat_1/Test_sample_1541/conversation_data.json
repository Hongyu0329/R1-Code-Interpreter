    "Answering this question requires a careful analysis of the problem to find the most memory-efficient solution in C. The goal is to calculate the total memory in bytes, `m`, used by the variables in this optimal program.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Problem**\n\nThe task is to take an input string representing a sum of numbers (e.g., \"3+1+4+2+1\"), sort the numbers non-decreasingly, and print the new sum (e.g., \"1+1+2+3+4\"). The numbers involved are only 1, 2, 3, and 4. The key constraint is to design the *most memory-efficient* C program.\n\n**Step 2: Identifying Memory Bottlenecks in Naive Approaches**\n\nA straightforward approach would be to:\n1.  Read the entire input string into a character array. Since the string can be up to 1000 characters long, this would require `char s[1001];`, consuming **1001 bytes**.\n2.  Extract the numbers into an integer or character array. The maximum number of terms is (1000+1)/2 = 500. This would take `int nums[500];`, consuming another `500 * 4 = 2000` bytes.\n\nThese approaches are not memory-efficient. The main goal is to avoid storing the entire input string or the list of numbers in large arrays.\n\n**Step 3: Designing a Memory-Efficient Algorithm (Counting Sort)**\n\nThe most memory-efficient way to solve this is to realize we don't need to store the numbers themselves, only the *count* of each type of number. Since the numbers are limited to 1, 2, 3, and 4, we can use the \"Counting Sort\" algorithm.\n\nThe algorithm proceeds in two phases:\n1.  **Counting Phase:** Read the input one character at a time without storing the whole string. As we read each character, if it's a digit ('1', '2', '3', or '4'), we increment a corresponding counter. The '+' characters are simply ignored.\n2.  **Printing Phase:** After reading the entire input, we will have the total counts for each number. We can then construct the sorted output string by printing the numbers according to their counts (all the '1's, then all the '2's, etc.), being careful to place '+' symbols between them.\n\n**Step 4: Listing Necessary Variables and Calculating Total Memory (`m`)**\n\nLet's identify the minimum set of variables required to implement this memory-efficient algorithm in C. We assume a standard environment where `sizeof(int)` is 4 bytes and `sizeof(char)` is 1 byte.\n\n1.  **Counters for Numbers:** We need four integer variables to store the counts of the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n    *   `int count1, count2, count3, count4;`\n    *   Memory Usage: 4 variables * 4 bytes/variable = **16 bytes**.\n\n2.  **Input Character Storage:** To read the input character-by-character (e.g., using `getchar()`), we need one variable to hold the current character.\n    *   `char ch;`\n    *   Memory Usage: 1 variable * 1 byte/variable = **1 byte**.\n\n3.  **Printing Logic Flag:** To correctly print the '+' separator only *between* numbers, we need a flag to track if we are about to print the very first term. An integer variable can serve this purpose (e.g., 1 for yes, 0 for no).\n    *   `int is_first;`\n    *   Memory Usage: 1 variable * 4 bytes/variable = **4 bytes**.\n\n4.  **Loop Counter:** The printing phase will involve loops to print each number type according to its count (e.g., `for(i=0; i<count1; i++)`). This requires a single loop counter variable, which can be reused for all printing loops.\n    *   `int i;`\n    *   Memory Usage: 1 variable * 4 bytes/variable = **4 bytes**.\n\n**Step 5: Final Calculation of `m`**\n\nNow, we sum the memory usage of all the necessary variables:\n\nm = (memory for counters) + (memory for input character) + (memory for print flag) + (memory for loop counter)\nm = 16 bytes + 1 byte + 4 bytes + 4 bytes\nm = **25 bytes**\n\nThis is the minimal memory required for a clean, correct, and readable implementation of the most memory-efficient algorithm for this problem.\n\n<<<25>>>"
