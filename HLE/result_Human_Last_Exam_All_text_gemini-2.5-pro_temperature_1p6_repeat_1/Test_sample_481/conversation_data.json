    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the different numbers on the specified capsules.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the target medication and dosages:** The request is for Teva brand fluoxetine capsules in two specific dosages: 10mg and 20mg.\n2.  **Research the 10mg capsule imprint:** The first step is to find the official imprint code for the Teva brand 10mg fluoxetine capsule. Using pharmaceutical databases, we can determine the markings on this specific medication.\n3.  **Isolate the number for the 10mg capsule:** The Teva 10mg fluoxetine capsule is imprinted with the manufacturer's name on one part and a unique numerical code on the other. The specific number associated with the 10mg strength is **3104**.\n4.  **Research the 20mg capsule imprint:** The next step is to perform the same research for the Teva brand 20mg fluoxetine capsule to identify its specific markings.\n5.  **Isolate the number for the 20mg capsule:** Similar to the 10mg version, the 20mg capsule has an imprint. The numerical code that distinguishes the 20mg strength is **3105**.\n6.  **Synthesize the final answer:** By comparing the information from the previous steps, we can directly answer the user's question. The question asks for the \"different numbers\". The number on the 10mg capsule is \"3104\" and the number on the 20mg capsule is \"3105\".\n\n**Careful points:**\n\n*   **Focus on Numbers:** The query specifically asks for the \"numbers\" on the capsules, so any text or branding (like \"TEVA\") should be excluded from the final answer.\n*   **Adherence to Constraints:** The request explicitly forbids mentioning color, size, or the word \"PLIVA\". The analysis must respect these constraints.\n*   **Accuracy:** It is critical to consult reliable drug identification sources to ensure the imprint codes are correct for the specified manufacturer and dosages.\n*   **Clarity:** The final answer should be simple and directly state the numbers that differentiate the two capsules.\n\n<<<The 10mg capsule is imprinted with the number 3104, and the 20mg capsule is imprinted with the number 3105.>>>"
