    "Answering this question requires understanding the principles of Computed Tomography Imaging Spectrometry (CTIS).\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Goal:** The goal is to construct a \"full spectral volume\" from a \"single image\". A spectral volume is a 3D data cube with two spatial dimensions (x, y) and one spectral dimension (wavelength, λ). We want to find the spectrum for every pixel in a 2D scene, all from one camera snapshot.\n\n2.  **Understand the Method:** The method is \"computed tomography\" (CT). Standard CT reconstructs a 3D spatial object (x, y, z) by taking many 2D projection images from different viewing angles around the object. The key idea is that to reconstruct an N-dimensional object, you need a sufficient set of (N-1)-dimensional projections taken from different \"angles\".\n\n3.  **Apply CT to Spectroscopy (CTIS):** In this problem, our object is the 3D spatiospectral data cube (x, y, λ). Our detector is a 2D camera sensor. The challenge is to get the necessary \"projections\" from this 3D cube onto our 2D sensor from a single snapshot.\n\n4.  **Role of the Diffraction Grating:** A diffraction grating is an optical element that disperses light, meaning it bends different wavelengths (colors) of light by different amounts. In a CTIS system, a grating is placed in the optical path before the camera sensor.\n    *   Without a grating, the sensor would just capture a standard 2D image, which is the sum of all wavelengths at each pixel. All spectral information would be lost. This is a single projection of the (x,y,λ) cube along the λ axis.\n    *   The grating's purpose is to create multiple, different projections of the (x,y,λ) cube and multiplex them (superimpose them) onto the single 2D sensor plane. Each diffraction order created by the grating acts as a unique projection.\n\n5.  **Analyze the \"Number of Gratings\" Requirement:**\n    *   **Case 1: One 1D Grating:** A single standard (1D) diffraction grating disperses light along one axis. It produces a central, undispersed 0th order image, and then a series of dispersed images (1st order, 2nd order, etc.) on either side, all along a single line. While this provides multiple projections, they are all related by a shear along the same single axis. In the language of tomography, the \"viewing angles\" of these projections are all coplanar. This is analogous to trying to do a medical CT scan by only taking X-rays from angles within a single plane—you cannot reconstruct the full 3D volume. This \"incomplete data\" set is insufficient for a robust tomographic reconstruction of the 3D (x,y,λ) cube.\n\n    *   **Case 2: Two 1D Gratings (or a single 2D Grating):** To solve the incomplete data problem, we need projections from non-coplanar viewing angles. This is achieved by creating dispersion in two dimensions. The standard way to do this is to use what is functionally equivalent to two 1D gratings oriented perpendicularly to each other. This can be implemented as two separate gratings or, more commonly, as a single optical element called a \"crossed grating\" or \"2D grating\". This 2D disperser creates a 2D grid of diffraction orders on the sensor. For example, you get a (0,0) order, a (1,0) order dispersed in x, a (0,1) order dispersed in y, a (1,1) order dispersed diagonally, and so on. This rich set of projections from various non-coplanar \"viewing angles\" provides sufficient information to satisfy the conditions for 3D tomographic reconstruction.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   The fundamental physical requirement is not the number of physical components, but the number of independent axes of dispersion needed to generate a complete set of projections for tomography.\n*   Reconstructing a 3D volume requires projections from non-coplanar directions.\n*   A 1D grating provides only coplanar projections, which is an insufficient condition.\n*   Two orthogonal axes of dispersion are required to provide the necessary non-coplanar projections. This corresponds to the function of two gratings.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nTo successfully apply the principles of computed tomography to reconstruct a 3D spectral data cube from a single 2D image, a dispersion pattern in two dimensions is necessary. This requires the functionality of two independent diffraction gratings, typically oriented perpendicularly. Therefore, the minimum number of gratings necessary is 2.\n\n<<<B>>>"
