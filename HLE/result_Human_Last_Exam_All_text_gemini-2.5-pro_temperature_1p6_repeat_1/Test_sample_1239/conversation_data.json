    "Answering this question requires finding the number of independent infinitesimal generators of the symmetry group of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in three spatial dimensions. This is a classic problem in the application of Lie group theory to differential equations.\n\n**Step 1: Write down the equations.**\nThe incompressible Navier-Stokes equations for a fluid velocity field $\\mathbf{u}(\\mathbf{x}, t) = (u_1, u_2, u_3)$ and pressure field $p(\\mathbf{x}, t)$ in $\\mathbb{R}^3 \\times \\mathbb{R}$ are given by the system:\n1.  **Momentum equation:** $\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}}{\\partial t} + (\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla) \\mathbf{u} = -\\nabla p + \\nu \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{u}$\n2.  **Incompressibility condition:** $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u} = 0$\nHere, $\\nu$ is the constant kinematic viscosity. We assume there are no external body forces. The variables are time $t$, spatial coordinates $\\mathbf{x} = (x_1, x_2, x_3)$, velocity components $\\mathbf{u}=(u_1, u_2, u_3)$, and pressure $p$.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the generators of the symmetry group.**\nA symmetry of a differential equation is a transformation of its independent and dependent variables that maps solutions to other solutions. The set of all such symmetries forms a Lie group. The dimension of the Lie group is the number of independent parameters that define the transformations, which corresponds to the number of linearly independent infinitesimal generators of the group.\n\nThe generators can be found by systematic application of the Lie algorithm, but for a well-known system like Navier-Stokes, the symmetry group is well-established in the literature. We can list the generators based on physical and mathematical considerations.\n\n**Careful Point 1: The Galilean Symmetries**\nThe Navier-Stokes equations describe fluid motion in a classical, non-relativistic setting. Therefore, they must be invariant under the transformations of the Galilean group. This provides a 10-dimensional group of symmetries.\n*   **Time translation (1 generator):** The equations do not depend explicitly on the origin of time.\n    *   Transformation: $t \\to t + \\epsilon$\n    *   Generator: $\\partial_t$\n*   **Space translations (3 generators):** The equations are invariant under a constant shift in spatial coordinates, reflecting the homogeneity of space.\n    *   Transformation: $\\mathbf{x} \\to \\mathbf{x} + \\epsilon\\mathbf{a}$\n    *   Generators: $\\partial_{x_1}$, $\\partial_{x_2}$, $\\partial_{x_3}$\n*   **Space rotations (3 generators):** The equations are invariant under rotations, reflecting the isotropy of space. The velocity vector $\\mathbf{u}$ transforms like the coordinate vector $\\mathbf{x}$.\n    *   Transformation: $\\mathbf{x} \\to R\\mathbf{x}$, $\\mathbf{u} \\to R\\mathbf{u}$ for $R \\in SO(3)$.\n    *   Generators (e.g., rotation about $x_1$-axis): $x_2\\partial_{x_3} - x_3\\partial_{x_2} + u_2\\partial_{u_3} - u_3\\partial_{u_2}$, and its cyclic permutations.\n*   **Galilean boosts (3 generators):** The equations are invariant when moving to a reference frame that is in constant-velocity translational motion relative to the original frame.\n    *   Transformation: $\\mathbf{x} \\to \\mathbf{x} + \\epsilon t\\mathbf{v}$, $\\mathbf{u} \\to \\mathbf{u} + \\epsilon\\mathbf{v}$\n    *   Generators: $t\\partial_{x_1} + \\partial_{u_1}$, $t\\partial_{x_2} + \\partial_{u_2}$, $t\\partial_{x_3} + \\partial_{u_3}$\n\nSo far, we have $1 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 10$ generators from the Galilean group.\n\n**Careful Point 2: Additional Symmetries**\nBeyond the Galilean group, the Navier-Stokes equations admit further symmetries.\n*   **Scaling Symmetry (1 generator):** The equations are invariant under a specific scaling of all variables. By substituting the ansatz $(t, \\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{u}, p) \\to (\\lambda^a t, \\lambda^b \\mathbf{x}, \\lambda^c \\mathbf{u}, \\lambda^d p)$ into the equations and demanding invariance, one finds a unique relationship between the exponents: $a=2, b=1, c=-1, d=-2$ (up to an overall multiplicative factor for the exponents).\n    *   Transformation: $(t, \\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{u}, p) \\to (\\lambda^2 t, \\lambda \\mathbf{x}, \\lambda^{-1} \\mathbf{u}, \\lambda^{-2} p)$\n    *   Generator: $2t\\partial_t + \\sum_{i=1}^3 x_i\\partial_{x_i} - \\sum_{i=1}^3 u_i\\partial_{u_i} - 2p\\partial_p$\n*   **Pressure Shift Symmetry (1 generator):** The pressure $p$ appears in the momentum equation only through its gradient, $\\nabla p$. Therefore, shifting $p$ by a constant, $p \\to p+c$, leaves the equation unchanged. The incompressibility condition is independent of $p$.\n    *   Transformation: $p \\to p + \\epsilon$\n    *   Generator: $\\partial_p$\n\nAdding these two generators to the ten from the Galilean group gives a total of $10 + 1 + 1 = 12$ generators.\n\n**Careful Point 3: The Infinite-Dimensional Part**\nThe pressure shift symmetry is actually part of a larger, infinite-dimensional group of symmetries. Since $\\nabla(p + h(t)) = \\nabla p$ for any arbitrary function $h(t)$ of time, the transformation $p \\to p+h(t)$ is a symmetry. This introduces an infinite number of generators (e.g., $t^k \\partial_p$ for $k=0, 1, 2, ...$ if $h(t)$ is a polynomial). When a question asks for the \"dimension of the Lie group,\" it typically refers to the dimension of the maximal *finite-dimensional* subalgebra of symmetries, as the inclusion of these so-called \"trivial\" or \"gauge\" symmetries would make the dimension infinite.\n\n**Step 3: Conclusion - Final Answer Calculation.**\nAssuming the question asks for the dimension of the maximal finite-dimensional Lie group of point symmetries, we sum the number of generators identified above.\n\nDimension = (Time Translation) + (Space Translations) + (Rotations) + (Boosts) + (Scaling) + (Constant Pressure Shift)\nDimension = 1 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 1 + 1 = 12.\n\nThis 12-dimensional Lie algebra is the well-established result for the symmetry group of the 3D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations.\n\nFinal list of generators:\n1.  $\\partial_t$ (1)\n2.  $\\partial_{x_i}$ (3)\n3.  $x_j \\partial_{x_k} - x_k \\partial_{x_j} + u_j \\partial_{u_k} - u_k \\partial_{u_j}$ (3)\n4.  $t \\partial_{x_i} + \\partial_{u_i}$ (3)\n5.  $2t\\partial_t + \\mathbf{x} \\cdot \\nabla_\\mathbf{x} - \\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla_\\mathbf{u} - 2p\\partial_p$ (1)\n6.  $\\partial_p$ (1)\n\nTotal: $1+3+3+3+1+1 = 12$.\n\n<<<12>>>"
