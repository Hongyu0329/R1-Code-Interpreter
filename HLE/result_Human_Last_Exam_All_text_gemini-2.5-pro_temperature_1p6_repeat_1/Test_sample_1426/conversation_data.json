    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the lowest of the final three notes played by the first violin in Dvořák's Symphony No. 2.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Musical Piece and Specific Part**\nThe question asks about a specific passage in a classical music piece.\n*   **Composer:** Antonín Dvořák\n*   **Work:** Symphony No. 2, Op. 4 (also catalogued as B. 12)\n*   **Instrument:** First Violin (Violino I)\n*   **Location:** The very end of the symphony.\n\n**Step 2: Locate the Score for Analysis**\nTo find the notes, we must consult the orchestral score. The symphony has four movements. The final movement is the \"IV. Allegro con fuoco\". We need to look at the very last measure of this movement.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Final Measure for the First Violin**\nUpon examining the score, we can see the symphony ends with the entire orchestra playing a powerful, sustained chord. The first violin part does not play three notes in sequence (one after another) at the very end. Instead, it \"ends on three notes\" by playing a chord consisting of three notes played simultaneously. This is known as a \"triple stop\".\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Notes in the Final Chord**\nThe symphony concludes in the key of B Major. The final chord played by the first violins is a B Major chord. Looking at the notes written on the treble clef staff for the first violin part in the final measure, we find:\n*   The highest note is F♯ (F sharp).\n*   The middle note is D♯ (D sharp).\n*   The lowest note is B.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the Lowest Note**\nThe three notes that the first violin part ends on are B, D♯, and F♯. Comparing these three pitches, the lowest one is the root of the chord.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   **Interpretation of \"three notes\":** It's crucial to understand that \"ends on three notes\" refers to the three pitches present in the final sound produced by the instrument, which in this case is a chord, not three notes played in a melodic sequence.\n*   **Key Signature:** The end of the movement is in B Major, which has five sharps. This is important for correctly identifying the notes (like D♯ and F♯).\n*   **Score Reading:** One must be able to read the treble clef to correctly identify the pitches on the staff. The lowest note of the chord, B, is written on the middle line of the treble clef.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBy analyzing the score of Dvořák's Symphony No. 2, we find that the first violins conclude the piece by playing a three-note chord (a triple stop). The notes are B, D♯, and F♯. The lowest of these three notes is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
