    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the number sequence problem.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the sequence and look for a simple pattern.**\nThe given sequence is: 2, 11, 23, 51, 119, ( )\nLet's first check the differences between consecutive terms (the first-order difference).\n*   11 - 2 = 9\n*   23 - 11 = 12\n*   51 - 23 = 28\n*   119 - 51 = 68\nThe sequence of differences is 9, 12, 28, 68. There is no obvious arithmetic or geometric progression here.\n\n**Step 2: Look for a more complex recursive pattern.**\nA common pattern in such problems is `a_n = k * a_{n-1} + C`, where `a_n` is the n-th term and `k` and `C` are constants. Since each term is roughly double the previous term, let's test `k=2`.\n*   Term 2: `2 * 2 = 4`. To get 11, we need to add 7. So, `11 = 2 * 2 + 7`.\n*   Term 3: `2 * 11 = 22`. To get 23, we need to add 1. So, `23 = 2 * 11 + 1`.\n*   Term 4: `2 * 23 = 46`. To get 51, we need to add 5. So, `51 = 2 * 23 + 5`.\n*   Term 5: `2 * 51 = 102`. To get 119, we need to add 17. So, `119 = 2 * 51 + 17`.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the sequence of additives.**\nThe rule is of the form `a_n = 2 * a_{n-1} + b_n`. The sequence of the additive terms `b_n` is {7, 1, 5, 17, ...}. The first term, 7, seems to be an outlier. Let's analyze the pattern starting from the second additive, which corresponds to the third term of the original sequence. Let's call this new sequence of additives `C = {1, 5, 17, ...}`.\n\n**Step 4: Find the pattern within the sequence `C`.**\nThe sequence is `C = {1, 5, 17, ...}`.\nLet's find the differences between the terms in `C`.\n*   5 - 1 = 4\n*   17 - 5 = 12\nThe differences are 4 and 12.\n\n**Step 5: Identify the pattern in the differences of `C` and extrapolate.**\nThe sequence of differences {4, 12} forms a geometric progression with a common ratio of 3 (since 12 / 4 = 3).\nTo find the next term in the difference sequence, we multiply the last term by 3:\n*   Next difference = 12 * 3 = 36.\n\nNow, we can find the next term in the sequence `C` by adding this difference to the last term of `C`:\n*   Next term in C = 17 + 36 = 53.\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the missing term in the original sequence.**\nThe next additive term is 53. We apply the rule `a_6 = 2 * a_5 + 53`.\n*   `a_5` is the last known term, which is 119.\n*   `a_6 = 2 * 119 + 53`\n*   `a_6 = 238 + 53`\n*   `a_6 = 291`\n\nThe number that should be filled in the parentheses is 291.\n\nFinal Answer Check:\n*   2\n*   11 = 2*2 + 7\n*   23 = 2*11 + 1\n*   51 = 2*23 + 5 (where 5 = 1 + 4)\n*   119 = 2*51 + 17 (where 17 = 5 + 12, and 12 = 4*3)\n*   (291) = 2*119 + 53 (where 53 = 17 + 36, and 36 = 12*3)\nThe pattern is consistent.\n\n<<<A>>>"
