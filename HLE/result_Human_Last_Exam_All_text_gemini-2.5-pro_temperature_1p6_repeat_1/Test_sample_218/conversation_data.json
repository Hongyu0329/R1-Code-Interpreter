    "Answering this question requires understanding the representation theory of the symmetric group $S_n$.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Irreducible Representations and Partitions**\n\nThe irreducible representations (irreps) of the symmetric group $S_n$ are in a one-to-one correspondence with the partitions of the integer $n$. A partition of $n$ is a sequence of non-increasing positive integers $\\lambda = (\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2, \\ldots, \\lambda_k)$ that sum to $n$. For this problem, $n=25$. Each irrep is associated with a Young diagram corresponding to its partition.\n\n**2. Dimension of Irreducible Representations**\n\nThe dimension of the irrep corresponding to a partition $\\lambda$, denoted $d_\\lambda$, is calculated using the Hook-Length Formula:\n$d_\\lambda = \\frac{n!}{\\prod h_\\lambda(i,j)}$\nwhere the product is over all boxes $(i,j)$ (row $i$, column $j$) in the Young diagram of $\\lambda$, and $h_\\lambda(i,j)$ is the hook length of the box $(i,j)$. The hook length is the number of boxes to the right of $(i,j)$ in the same row, plus the number of boxes below it in the same column, plus 1 (for the box itself).\n\n**3. Strategy for Finding Low-Dimension Irreps**\n\nThe dimension $d_\\lambda$ is small when the product of the hook lengths is large. The product of hook lengths is maximized for Young diagrams that are \"long and thin\" or \"tall and narrow\". These correspond to partitions where the first part $\\lambda_1$ is very large (close to $n$), or partitions with many small parts (the conjugate partition has a large first part).\n\nWe will systematically search for partitions $\\lambda$ of 25 such that $d_\\lambda < 500,000$. We start with partitions having the largest possible first part, $\\lambda_1$, and work our way down.\n\nAn important property is that the dimension of the irrep for a partition $\\lambda$ is equal to the dimension of the irrep for its conjugate partition $\\lambda'$. The conjugate partition $\\lambda'$ is obtained by transposing the Young diagram of $\\lambda$. Unless $\\lambda = \\lambda'$ (a self-conjugate partition), each qualifying partition $\\lambda$ gives us a pair of irreps $(\\lambda, \\lambda')$ with the same dimension. The partitions we will encounter are highly skewed and thus not self-conjugate.\n\n**4. Calculations**\n\nWe need to find all partitions $\\lambda$ of 25 where $d_\\lambda < 500,000$.\n\n*   **Case 1: $\\lambda_1 = 25$**\n    *   $\\lambda = (25)$: This is the trivial representation. $d_{(25)} = 1$.\n    *   Its conjugate is $\\lambda'=(1^{25})$, the sign representation. $d_{(1^{25})} = 1$.\n    *   **Count: 2**\n\n*   **Case 2: $\\lambda_1 = 24$**\n    *   The only partition is $\\lambda = (24, 1)$. This corresponds to the standard representation (of dimension $n-1$).\n    *   $d_{(24,1)} = 25 - 1 = 24$.\n    *   Its conjugate is $\\lambda'=(2, 1^{23})$, with $d_{(2,1^{23})} = 24$.\n    *   **Count: 2**\n\n*   **Case 3: $\\lambda_1 = 23$** (Partitions of 2 must be appended)\n    *   $\\lambda = (23, 2)$: $d_{(23,2)} = \\binom{25}{2} - \\binom{25}{1} = 300 - 25 = 275$. (conjugate is $(2^2, 1^{21})$)\n    *   $\\lambda = (23, 1, 1)$: $d_{(23,1,1)} = \\binom{25-1}{2} = \\binom{24}{2} = 276$. (conjugate is $(3, 1^{22})$)\n    *   **Count: 4**\n\n*   **Case 4: $\\lambda_1 = 22$** (Partitions of 3 must be appended)\n    *   $\\lambda = (22, 3)$: $d_{(22,3)} = \\binom{25}{3} - \\binom{25}{2} = 2300 - 300 = 2000$.\n    *   $\\lambda = (22, 2, 1)$: $d_{(22,2,1)} = 4025$.\n    *   $\\lambda = (22, 1, 1, 1)$: $d_{(22,1^3)} = \\binom{24}{3} = 2024$.\n    *   All are < 500,000. **Count: 6**\n\n*   **Case 5: $\\lambda_1 = 21$** (Partitions of 4 must be appended)\n    *   $\\lambda = (21, 4)$: $d = 10350$.\n    *   $\\lambda = (21, 3, 1)$: $d = 26400$.\n    *   $\\lambda = (21, 2, 2)$: $d = 42000$.\n    *   $\\lambda = (21, 2, 1, 1)$: $d = 31625$.\n    *   $\\lambda = (21, 1^4)$: $d = 10626$.\n    *   All 5 partitions of 4 appended to 21 result in irreps with dimension < 500,000. **Count: 10**\n\n*   **Case 6: $\\lambda_1 = 20$** (Partitions of 5 must be appended)\n    *   $\\lambda = (20, 5)$: $d = 42504$.\n    *   $\\lambda = (20, 4, 1)$: $d = 164220$.\n    *   $\\lambda = (20, 3, 2)$: $d = 165600$.\n    *   $\\lambda = (20, 3, 1, 1)$: $d = 132000$.\n    *   $\\lambda = (20, 2, 2, 1)$: $d = 182700$.\n    *   $\\lambda = (20, 2, 1, 1, 1)$: $d = 88550$.\n    *   $\\lambda = (20, 1^5)$: $d = 42504$.\n    *   All 7 partitions of 5 appended to 20 result in irreps with dimension < 500,000. **Count: 14**\n\n*   **Case 7: $\\lambda_1 = 19$** (Partitions of 6 must be appended)\n    *   $\\lambda = (19, 6)$: $d = \\binom{25}{6} - \\binom{25}{5} = 177100 - 53130 = 123970$.\n    *   $\\lambda = (19, 5, 1)$: $d = 480480$.\n    *   $\\lambda = (19, 4, 2)$: $d = 595650$. This is > 500,000.\n    *   Dimensions tend to increase as the appended partition becomes \"less skewed\" (e.g., (4,2) vs (5,1)). So, we don't need to check other partitions of 6. Only two partitions work.\n    *   **Count: 4**\n\n*   **Case 8: $\\lambda_1 = 18$** (Partitions of 7 must be appended)\n    *   $\\lambda = (18, 7)$: $d = \\binom{25}{7} - \\binom{25}{6} = 480700 - 177100 = 303600$.\n    *   $\\lambda = (18, 6, 1)$: $d > 1,400,000$.\n    *   Only one partition works.\n    *   **Count: 2**\n\n*   **Case 9: $\\lambda_1 = 17$** (Partitions of 8 must be appended)\n    *   $\\lambda = (17, 8)$: $d = \\binom{25}{8} - \\binom{25}{7} = 1081575 - 480700 = 600875$.\n    *   This is > 500,000. No partitions starting with 17 or smaller will have irreps with dimensions under the threshold, as their dimensions will be even larger.\n\n**5. Final Tally**\n\nWe sum the counts from each case.\nTotal irreps = (from $\\lambda_1=25$) + (from $\\lambda_1=24$) + (from $\\lambda_1=23$) + (from $\\lambda_1=22$) + (from $\\lambda_1=21$) + (from $\\lambda_1=20$) + (from $\\lambda_1=19$) + (from $\\lambda_1=18$)\nTotal irreps = $2 + 2 + 4 + 6 + 10 + 14 + 4 + 2 = 44$.\n\n### Careful Points\n1.  **Correct Tool:** The Hook-Length formula is the central tool.\n2.  **Systematic Search:** The search strategy of decreasing the largest part $\\lambda_1$ is crucial. It ensures that we find the smallest dimension irreps first and provides a clear stopping point.\n3.  **Conjugate Partitions:** Remembering that $d_\\lambda=d_{\\lambda'}$ and that skewed partitions are not self-conjugate is key to correctly counting the total number of irreps.\n4.  **Dimension Behavior:** Knowing that for a fixed $\\lambda_1$, the dimension tends to increase as the remaining part of the partition becomes less skewed helps to prune the search space effectively.\n5.  **Accuracy:** The dimension calculations, especially for more complex shapes, must be done carefully. Using known formulas for partitions with two parts, like $(n-k,k)$, simplifies some calculations.\n\nThe analysis shows there are 22 partitions (none of which are self-conjugate) that satisfy the condition, leading to 44 distinct irreducible representations.\n\n<<<44>>>"
