    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the poetic device in Vergil's line.\n\n**The Line:**\n\"Nascere, praeque diem veniens age, Lucifer, almum\"\n\n**Translation:**\n\"Be born, and coming before the day, Lucifer, lead on the nurturing day.\"\n\n**Step 1: Understand the constraints of the question.**\nThe question asks for a poetic device found in the line, but it specifically excludes the following:\n*   Apostrophe / Personification\n*   Sound effects (alliteration, assonance, consonance)\n*   Hyperbaton\n\n**Step 2: Identify the excluded devices within the line to confirm understanding.**\n*   **Apostrophe/Personification:** The line directly addresses \"Lucifer\" (the morning star) as a sentient being capable of understanding and obeying commands. This is clearly apostrophe and personification. We must ignore this.\n*   **Sound Effects:** There is noticeable **assonance** with the repetition of the 'e' sound in `Nascere`, `praeque`, `diem`, `veniens`, `age`. We must ignore this.\n*   **Hyperbaton:** This is the separation of words that grammatically belong together. In the most common reading of the line, the adjective `almum` (\"nurturing\") modifies the noun `diem` (\"day\"). These two words are separated by the entire phrase `veniens age, Lucifer`. This separation (`diem ... almum`) is a clear and strong example of hyperbaton. We must ignore this device as well.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the remaining elements of the line for other poetic devices.**\nWith the most obvious devices excluded, we must look more closely at grammar, structure, and word choice. Let's analyze the phrase `almum diem` (\"the nurturing day\").\n\n*   The adjective is `almus, -a, -um`, which means \"nurturing,\" \"fostering,\" \"kind,\" or \"life-giving.\" It comes from the verb `alo`, \"to nourish.\"\n*   This adjective is applied to the noun `dies`, \"day.\"\n\nNow, we must ask a semantic question: Is the day, as a unit of time, inherently \"nurturing\"? Or is it the light, warmth, and life-enabling conditions *within* the day that are nurturing?\n\nThe quality of \"nurturing\" more logically belongs to the effects or contents of the day (e.g., the sun's light and warmth) rather than the temporal concept of the day itself. Vergil has transferred the quality of \"nurturing\" from the *effect* (nurturing light) to the *cause/container* (the day).\n\nThis specific figure of speech, where an epithet (an adjective or descriptive phrase) is transferred from the noun to which it should logically belong to another noun in the sentence, is called a **transferred epithet** or, by its Greek rhetorical name, **enallage**.\n\n**Careful Points & Summary of Analysis:**\n1.  The question forces a deeper analysis by excluding the most prominent devices (apostrophe, hyperbaton).\n2.  The standard grammatical reading pairs `diem` with `almum`.\n3.  The separation of these words constitutes hyperbaton (which we must ignore).\n4.  The semantic relationship between these words constitutes enallage (a transferred epithet).\n5.  Enallage is a distinct rhetorical device from hyperbaton. Hyperbaton deals with word order (syntax), while enallage deals with meaning (semantics).\n6.  Therefore, even though the same two words are involved, the line contains enallage *in addition to* the excluded hyperbaton.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBy analyzing the meaning of the words `almum diem`, we find that the adjective `almum` is logically displaced. This creates the figure of speech known as a transferred epithet, or enallage.\n\n<<<Enallage (or Transferred Epithet)>>>"
