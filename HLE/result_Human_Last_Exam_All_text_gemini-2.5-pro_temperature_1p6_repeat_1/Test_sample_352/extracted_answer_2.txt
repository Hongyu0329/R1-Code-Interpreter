The best replacement for the amino acids at positions 47-50 would be to mutate all four residues to Alanine (A). The native sequence Ser-Glu-Glu-Asp (SEED) at positions 47-50 would be changed to Ala-Ala-Ala-Ala (AAAA). This would eliminate the negative charges from Glutamate and Aspartate and, most importantly, prevent the addition of a strong negative charge via phosphorylation at position 47, thus cleanly testing the hypothesis that this negatively charged patch is autoinhibitory.
