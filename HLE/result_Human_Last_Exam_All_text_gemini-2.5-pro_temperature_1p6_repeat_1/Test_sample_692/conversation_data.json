    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Question:**\nThe question asks for the \"earliest known date\" that was \"recorded\" by a \"pre-Columbian civilization\" using an \"aboriginal writing system\".\n*   **Earliest known date:** This refers to the oldest specific point in time noted on an artifact, not the age of the writing system itself or the age of the artifact in general.\n*   **Recorded:** The date must be physically inscribed or painted on an object like a stone monument (stela), ceramic vessel, or building wall.\n*   **Pre-Columbian civilization:** The culture must be from the Americas and predate Christopher Columbus's arrival in 1492.\n*   **Aboriginal writing system:** The script must be indigenous to the Americas (e.g., Maya, Zapotec, Epi-Olmec script).\n\n**2. Identify Potential Candidates:**\nSeveral pre-Columbian Mesoamerican cultures developed sophisticated writing and calendrical systems. The most likely candidates for the earliest recorded date come from the Maya, the Epi-Olmec, and the Zapotec.\n\n*   **The Maya:** The Maya are famous for their Long Count calendar, which could pinpoint dates with great accuracy. For many years, the earliest known contemporary Long Count date was found on **Stela 29 at Tikal**, Guatemala. This stela records the date 8.12.14.8.15 in the Long Count, which corresponds to **July 6, 292 CE**. While this is very old, subsequent discoveries have found earlier dates from other civilizations.\n\n*   **The Epi-Olmec (or Isthmian):** This culture, which flourished in the Veracruz region of Mexico after the decline of the Olmecs, also used a version of the Long Count calendar. The **La Mojarra Stela 1**, a major monument of this culture, contains two Long Count dates. The earlier of the two is 8.5.3.3.5, which corresponds to **May 21, 143 CE**. This is significantly older than the Tikal stela. Another Epi-Olmec artifact, the **Tuxtla Statuette**, bears an even earlier Long Count date of 8.6.2.4.17, which corresponds to **March 14, 162 CE**. So, the La Mojarra date remains the earlier of the two.\n\n*   **The Zapotec:** The Zapotec civilization, centered in the Valley of Oaxaca, developed one of the earliest writing systems in Mesoamerica. At the archaeological site of **San José Mogote** in Oaxaca, a carved stone monument, known as **Monument 3**, depicts a slain captive. Between the captive's legs is a glyph representing a date from the 260-day sacred calendar. This calendar, common to nearly all Mesoamerican cultures, named days using a combination of a number (1-13) and one of 20 day signs. The glyph on Monument 3 is widely interpreted by scholars as the calendrical name \"**1 Earthquake**\" (or 1 Motion).\n\n**3. Compare the Candidates and Determine the Earliest Date:**\n*   Maya Date (Tikal Stela 29): **292 CE**\n*   Epi-Olmec Date (La Mojarra Stela 1): **143 CE**\n*   Zapotec Date (San José Mogote Monument 3): This date is not from the Long Count, so it doesn't give a specific year in our modern system. However, the monument itself has been archaeologically dated based on its style and the context in which it was found. Archaeologists, including Kent Flannery and Joyce Marcus who excavated the site, date the monument to approximately **600 BCE**.\n\n**4. Conclusion and Careful Points:**\n*   The key distinction is between a *Long Count* date (like those from the Maya and Epi-Olmec), which specifies a day within a long linear cycle, and a *calendrical name* from the 260-day ritual calendar (like the Zapotec example).\n*   The question asks for the \"earliest known date recorded,\" which the \"1 Earthquake\" glyph certainly is—it is a specific day name from an established calendrical system, written down in a formal script.\n*   The date of the *recording* of the Zapotec glyph (c. 600 BCE) is much earlier than the *dates being recorded* by the Epi-Olmec (143 CE) and Maya (292 CE).\n*   Therefore, the Zapotec glyph on Monument 3 at San José Mogote represents the earliest known instance of a date being recorded in a pre-Columbian writing system.\n\n***\nThe earliest known date recorded by a pre-Columbian civilization in an aboriginal writing system is **\"1 Earthquake\"**, a day from the 260-day ritual calendar. This date is carved on **Monument 3** at the Zapotec site of San José Mogote in Oaxaca, Mexico. The monument itself is dated archaeologically to approximately **600 BCE**.\n\n<<<\"1 Earthquake\" recorded on Monument 3 at San José Mogote, circa 600 BCE.>>>"
