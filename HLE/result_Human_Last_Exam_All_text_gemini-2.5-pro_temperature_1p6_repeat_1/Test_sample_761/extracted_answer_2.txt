No. Structurally, polynucleotides (including homopolynucleotides) are not polysaccharides. They are fundamentally different classes of macromolecules for several key reasons:
1.  **Monomer Unit:** The monomer of a polysaccharide is a simple sugar (a monosaccharide). The monomer of a polynucleotide is a nucleotide, which is a composite molecule made of a sugar, a phosphate group, and a nitrogenous base.
2.  **Backbone Composition:** A polysaccharide has a backbone made of sugar units linked directly to each other (sugar-sugar). A polynucleotide has a sugar-phosphate backbone, where sugar and phosphate groups alternate.
3.  **Bonding:** The monomers in polysaccharides are linked by glycosidic bonds. The monomers in polynucleotides are linked by phosphodiester bonds.
4.  **Elemental Composition:** Polysaccharides are made of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. Polynucleotides also contain nitrogen (in the bases) and phosphorus (in the backbone).
Therefore, despite both being polymers that contain sugar moieties, their overall structure, chemical composition, and bonding are completely different.
