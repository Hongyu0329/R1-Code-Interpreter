    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the symmetry factor of the specified Feynman diagram.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstructing the Question and Identifying the Diagram\n\nThe question asks for the symmetry factor of a Feynman diagram with the following properties:\n*   **Two vertices:** The diagram is of second order in the interaction Lagrangian.\n*   **Four field contractions:** These contractions correspond to the propagators (lines) of the diagram.\n\nTo have two vertices and four lines connecting them, each vertex must have four fields emanating from it. This strongly implies we are working within a **quartic interaction theory**, with the most common example being the **$\\phi^4$ theory**. The interaction Lagrangian for this theory is typically written as:\n$\\mathcal{L}_{int} = -\\frac{\\lambda}{4!} \\phi^4$\n\nThe question implies a **connected diagram**. For a connected diagram with two vertices, all four contractions must be lines that connect the two vertices. This results in a diagram with a specific topology: two vertices joined together by four distinct lines. This is sometimes referred to as a \"setting-sun\" diagram if it appears as a self-energy insertion, but here we consider its abstract topology.\n\n### Step 2: Listing Careful Points and Assumptions\n\n1.  **Theory:** We assume the theory is the standard scalar $\\phi^4$ theory. The problem's description (2 vertices, 4 contractions) naturally leads to this conclusion, as each vertex must supply 4 field \"legs\".\n2.  **Lagrangian Convention:** We assume the standard convention where the interaction term includes a factorial factor, i.e., $\\frac{\\lambda}{4!}\\phi^4$. This factor is designed to simplify combinatorial calculations, ensuring the final coefficient related to diagram topology is precisely $1/S$, where $S$ is the symmetry factor.\n3.  **Vertices:** The two vertices arise from the same interaction term in the Lagrangian, so they are considered **identical**. If they were from different interactions, they would be distinguishable, which would change the symmetry factor.\n4.  **Propagators (Lines):** The four lines connecting the vertices are identical, as they represent the same type of field propagator.\n5.  **Diagram Connectivity:** We assume the question refers to a connected Feynman diagram, which is standard unless specified otherwise. A disconnected diagram with two vertices and four contractions would have a different topology and a different symmetry factor.\n\n### Step 3: Acquiring the Final Answer with Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nThere are two common methods to calculate the symmetry factor, S.\n\n#### Method 1: Using the Definition from Perturbation Theory\n\nThe contribution of a specific diagram to a Green's function comes from expanding the exponential in the path integral:\n$Z \\propto \\int \\mathcal{D}\\phi \\, e^{iS_0[\\phi]} \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n!} \\left( i \\int d^4x \\mathcal{L}_{int} \\right)^n$\n\nFor our diagram with two vertices ($n=2$) from $\\mathcal{L}_{int} = -\\frac{\\lambda}{4!} \\phi^4$, the relevant term in the expansion is:\n$\\frac{1}{2!} \\left( \\frac{-i\\lambda}{4!} \\right)^2 \\int d^4x_1 d^4x_2 \\langle T \\{ \\phi(x_1)^4 \\phi(x_2)^4 \\} \\rangle$\n\nWe need to find the number of Wick contractions, $N$, that produce the desired topology (two vertices connected by four lines). This requires contracting all four fields at vertex $x_1$ with the four fields at vertex $x_2$.\n\n*   Pick the first field at $x_1$. There are 4 fields at $x_2$ to which it can be contracted.\n*   Pick the second field at $x_1$. There are 3 remaining fields at $x_2$ to contract with.\n*   Pick the third field at $x_1$. There are 2 remaining fields at $x_2$.\n*   The last field at $x_1$ must contract with the last field at $x_2$.\n\nThe total number of ways to form these pairings is $N = 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 4! = 24$.\n\nThe total numerical prefactor from combinatorics is the product of the expansion factor, the Lagrangian factors, and the number of ways to contract:\n$\\text{Prefactor} = \\frac{1}{2!} \\times \\left( \\frac{1}{4!} \\right)^2 \\times N = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{(24)^2} \\times 24 = \\frac{1}{2 \\times 24} = \\frac{1}{48}$\n\nThe contribution of a diagram in Feynman rules is written as $\\frac{1}{S} \\times (\\text{integrals of vertices and propagators})$. The factor we calculated, $\\frac{1}{48}$, is this purely combinatorial part, $1/S$.\nTherefore, the symmetry factor is $S = 48$.\n\n#### Method 2: The Automorphism Group Approach\n\nThe symmetry factor, S, is the order of the automorphism group of the diagram. This means it is the number of ways you can permute the components of the diagram (its vertices and lines) that leaves the diagram's structure unchanged.\n\n1.  **Vertex Permutations:** The diagram has two vertices which come from the same interaction term. They are identical. We can swap the two vertices, and the diagram remains unchanged. This contributes a factor of $2! = 2$.\n2.  **Line Permutations:** The diagram has four lines connecting the two vertices. These lines all represent identical propagators. We can permute these four lines among themselves in any way, and the diagram remains unchanged. This contributes a factor of $4! = 24$.\n\nThe total symmetry factor is the product of these independent symmetry operations:\n$S = (\\text{Vertex Permutations}) \\times (\\text{Line Permutations}) = 2! \\times 4! = 2 \\times 24 = 48$.\n\nBoth methods yield the same result, which gives us confidence in the answer.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe symmetry factor associated with a Feynman diagram featuring two identical vertices connected by four identical lines in $\\phi^4$ theory is 48.\n\n<<<48>>>"
