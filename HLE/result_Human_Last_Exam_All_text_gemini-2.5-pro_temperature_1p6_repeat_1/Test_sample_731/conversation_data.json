    "Answering this question involves a step-by-step analysis of the group structure and the definition of a power subgroup.\n\n**Step 1: Identify and Define the Group and Subgroup**\n\n*   **The Group:** The group in question is the semidihedral group of size 512. The semidihedral group of order $2^n$ is denoted as $SD_{2^n}$. Here, the size is $512 = 2^9$, so we have the group $G = SD_{512}$ (with $n=9$).\n*   **Group Presentation:** The standard presentation of $SD_{2^n}$ is $G = \\langle r, s \\mid r^{2^{n-1}} = 1, s^2 = 1, srs = r^{2^{n-2}-1} \\rangle$.\n    For $n=9$, this becomes $G = \\langle r, s \\mid r^{256} = 1, s^2 = 1, srs = r^{127} \\rangle$.\n    The group $G$ has $512$ elements: $\\{r^i \\mid 0 \\le i < 256\\} \\cup \\{sr^i \\mid 0 \\le i < 256\\}$.\n*   **The Power Subgroup:** The term \"power subgroup\" is not standard, but it is commonly used as a synonym for the **Frattini subgroup**, denoted $\\Phi(G)$. The Frattini subgroup is the intersection of all maximal subgroups of $G$. The question is interpreted as asking for the number of subgroups contained within the Frattini subgroup of $G$.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Frattini Subgroup $\\Phi(G)$**\n\nFor a finite $p$-group (our group is a 2-group, so $p=2$), the Frattini subgroup can be calculated using the formula $\\Phi(G) = G'G^2$, where $G'$ is the commutator subgroup and $G^2$ is the subgroup generated by the squares of all elements of $G$.\n\n1.  **Calculate the Commutator Subgroup $G'$**:\n    The commutator subgroup $G'$ is generated by the commutators of the group's generators. Let's compute the commutator of $r$ and $s$:\n    $[r, s] = r^{-1}s^{-1}rs = r^{-1}s(rs)$.\n    From the relation $srs = r^{127}$, we substitute $rs$ with $s^{-1}r^{127}s = sr^{127}s$. No, let's substitute $srs$:\n    $[r, s] = r^{-1}(srs) = r^{-1}r^{127} = r^{126}$.\n    So, $G'$ is the cyclic group generated by $r^{126}$, i.e., $G' = \\langle r^{126} \\rangle$.\n    The order of $r$ is 256. The order of $r^{126}$ is $256 / \\text{gcd}(256, 126) = 256 / 2 = 128$.\n    We can simplify the generator: $126 = 2 \\times 63$. Since $63$ is odd, it is coprime to the order of the group $\\langle r^2 \\rangle$ (which is 128). Therefore, $r^{126} = (r^2)^{63}$ is also a generator of $\\langle r^2 \\rangle$. Thus, $G' = \\langle r^2 \\rangle$.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Subgroup of Squares $G^2$**:\n    $G^2$ is generated by the squares of all elements in $G$. The elements are of the form $r^i$ or $sr^i$.\n    *   For elements of the form $r^i$: $(r^i)^2 = r^{2i}$. These squares generate the subgroup $\\langle r^2 \\rangle$.\n    *   For elements of the form $sr^i$: $(sr^i)^2 = sr^i s r^i$. From the relation $srs = r^{127}$, we can derive $sr^k s^{-1} = (srs^{-1})^k = (r^{127})^k = r^{127k}$. Since $s^2=1$, this gives $sr^k s = r^{127k}$.\n      So, $(sr^i)^2 = (sr^i s)r^i = (r^{127i})r^i = r^{128i}$.\n    The subgroup $G^2$ is generated by all these squares: $G^2 = \\langle \\{r^{2i}\\} \\cup \\{r^{128j}\\} \\rangle = \\langle r^2, r^{128} \\rangle$.\n    Since $r^{128} = (r^2)^{64}$, the subgroup $\\langle r^{128} \\rangle$ is contained within $\\langle r^2 \\rangle$. Therefore, $G^2 = \\langle r^2 \\rangle$.\n\n3.  **Determine $\\Phi(G)$**:\n    $\\Phi(G) = G'G^2 = \\langle r^2 \\rangle \\langle r^2 \\rangle = \\langle r^2 \\rangle$.\n    So, the power subgroup (Frattini subgroup) of $SD_{512}$ is the cyclic subgroup generated by $r^2$.\n\n**Step 3: Count the Subgroups of the Power Subgroup**\n\nThe question now simplifies to finding the number of subgroups of $\\Phi(G) = \\langle r^2 \\rangle$.\n\n1.  **Find the order of $\\Phi(G)$**:\n    The order of $\\Phi(G)$ is the order of its generator, $r^2$.\n    The order of $r$ is 256.\n    The order of $r^k$ in a cyclic group of order $m$ generated by $x$ is $m/\\text{gcd}(m,k)$. Here $x=r$, $m=256$, $k=2$.\n    Order of $r^2$ = $256 / \\text{gcd}(256, 2) = 256 / 2 = 128$.\n    So, $\\Phi(G)$ is a cyclic group of order 128, isomorphic to $C_{128}$.\n\n2.  **Count the subgroups of a cyclic group**:\n    A fundamental theorem of group theory states that the number of subgroups of a finite cyclic group of order $m$ is equal to the number of positive divisors of $m$, denoted by $\\tau(m)$.\n    We need to find the number of subgroups of $C_{128}$, which is $\\tau(128)$.\n\n3.  **Calculate $\\tau(128)$**:\n    First, find the prime factorization of 128: $128 = 2^7$.\n    The number of divisors of $p^a$ is $a+1$.\n    So, $\\tau(128) = \\tau(2^7) = 7 + 1 = 8$.\n\nThe divisors are $1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128$. For each divisor, there is exactly one subgroup of that order in a cyclic group. Thus, there are 8 subgroups in total.\n\nFinal Answer\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{8}$."
