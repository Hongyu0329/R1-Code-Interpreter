Given that interleukin-15 promotes the development of a more persistent and functionally robust memory T cell phenotype, it is predicted that CAR T cells manufactured with interleukin-15 would exhibit increased release of key effector cytokines (such as IFN-γ and TNF-α) upon antigen stimulation when compared to CAR T cells manufactured without it.
