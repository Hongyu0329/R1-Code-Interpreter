    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the first 3 digits after the comma of tan(10^100).\n\n**Step 1: Understand the periodicity of the tangent function**\n\nThe tangent function, `tan(x)`, is periodic with a period of `π` (pi). This means that `tan(x) = tan(x + kπ)` for any integer `k`. When we are asked to compute the tangent of a very large number like `10^100`, we can simplify the problem by finding the equivalent angle within a single period interval, for example, `[0, π)`.\n\nThis is equivalent to finding the remainder when `10^100` is divided by `π`. In mathematical terms, we want to compute `tan(10^100 mod π)`.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the remainder `r = 10^100 mod π`**\n\nThe remainder `r` can be calculated using the formula:\n`r = (10^100 / π - floor(10^100 / π)) * π`\n\nLet `{x}` denote the fractional part of a number `x` (i.e., `x - floor(x)`). The formula simplifies to:\n`r = {10^100 / π} * π`\n\nSo, the problem boils down to finding the fractional part of `10^100 / π`.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the fractional part `{10^100 / π}`**\n\nTo find the fractional part of `10^100 / π`, we need to know the decimal expansion of `1/π`.\nMultiplying `1/π` by `10^100` shifts the decimal point 100 places to the right.\n\nFirst, let's find the magnitude of `10^100 / π`.\n`log10(10^100 / π) = log10(10^100) - log10(π) = 100 - 0.4971... = 99.5028...`\nThe number of digits in the integer part of `10^100 / π` is `floor(99.5028...) + 1 = 99 + 1 = 100`.\n\nThis means `10^100 / π` has 100 digits before the decimal point. Its fractional part is determined by the digits of `1/π` that come *after* the first 100 digits.\n\nLet `1/π = 0.d_1 d_2 d_3 ... d_{100} d_{101} d_{102} ...`\nThen `10^100 / π = d_1 d_2 ... d_{100} . d_{101} d_{102} ...`\nSo, `{10^100 / π} = 0.d_{101} d_{102} d_{103} ...`\n\n**Step 4: Find the required digits of `1/π`**\n\nWe need to use a high-precision calculation of `1/π` to find the digits starting from the 101st decimal place. Using a computational tool (like WolframAlpha or a math library), we find the value of `1/π`.\n\nThe digits of `1/π` are:\n`0.3183098861837906715377675267450287240689192914809128974953344244534888559798482457734563935126848983...`\nCounting the digits, the 100th digit after the decimal point is `3`.\n\nThe digits starting from the 101st place are `563279...`.\nTherefore, the fractional part we need is approximately:\n`{10^100 / π} ≈ 0.563279`\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the final angle and its tangent**\n\nNow we calculate the angle `r` and then its tangent:\n`r = {10^100 / π} * π ≈ 0.563279 * π`\n\nUsing a precise value for `π ≈ 3.14159265`, we get:\n`r ≈ 0.563279 * 3.14159265 ≈ 1.76959` radians.\n\nNow we compute `tan(r)`:\n`tan(10^100) = tan(r) ≈ tan(1.76959)`\n\nWe can note that `π/2 ≈ 1.5708` and `π ≈ 3.1416`. Since `π/2 < 1.76959 < π`, the angle `r` is in the second quadrant, which means its tangent will be negative.\n\nUsing a calculator for `tan(1.76959)`:\n`tan(1.76959) ≈ -4.904719...`\n\n**Step 6: Extract the final answer**\n\nThe value of `tan(10^100)` is approximately `-4.904719...`. The question asks for the first 3 digits after the comma (decimal point).\n\nThe digits after the decimal point are `9`, `0`, and `4`.\n\nTherefore, the first 3 digits after the comma of tan(10^100) are 904.\n\n<<<904>>>"
