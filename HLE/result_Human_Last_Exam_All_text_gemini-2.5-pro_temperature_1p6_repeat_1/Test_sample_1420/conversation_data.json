    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the scaling exponent $\\alpha$.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Theoretical Framework:** The question requires using the renormalization group (RG) framework, specifically the epsilon ($\\epsilon$) expansion, to find the specific heat exponent $\\alpha$.\n\n2.  **Define the Epsilon Expansion:** The $\\epsilon$-expansion is a perturbative technique used near the upper critical dimension, $d_c$. The expansion parameter is $\\epsilon = d_c - d$. For the universality classes of models like the Ising, XY, and Heisenberg models (generally known as the $n$-vector models), the upper critical dimension is $d_c = 4$. Since the question asks for the exponent in a spatial dimension of $d=3$, we will set $\\epsilon = 4 - 3 = 1$ at the end of the calculation.\n\n3.  **Use Scaling Relations:** A key result from RG theory is the existence of scaling relations that connect different critical exponents. The hyperscaling relation connects the specific heat exponent $\\alpha$ to the correlation length exponent $\\nu$ and the spatial dimension $d$:\n    $2 - \\alpha = d\\nu$\n    Rearranging this gives:\n    $\\alpha = 2 - d\\nu$\n\n4.  **Find the Expression for the Exponent $\\nu$:** The next step is to find the expression for the exponent $\\nu$ using the $\\epsilon$-expansion. For the general $n$-vector model (where $n$ is the number of components of the order parameter, e.g., $n=1$ for the Ising model), the one-loop RG calculation yields the following expression for $\\nu$:\n    $\\nu = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{n+2}{4(n+8)}\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n    The leading term, $1/2$, is the result from mean-field theory. The term proportional to $\\epsilon$ is the first-order correction due to fluctuations.\n\n5.  **Calculate $\\alpha$ in terms of $\\epsilon$:** Now, we substitute the expressions for $d=4-\\epsilon$ and $\\nu$ into the hyperscaling relation. It is crucial to be consistent and keep only terms up to the first order in $\\epsilon$.\n    $\\alpha = 2 - (4 - \\epsilon) \\left( \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{n+2}{4(n+8)}\\epsilon \\right)$\n    We expand this product:\n    $\\alpha = 2 - \\left[ (4 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}) + (4 \\cdot \\frac{n+2}{4(n+8)}\\epsilon) - (\\epsilon \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}) \\right] + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n    The term $(-\\epsilon) \\cdot (\\frac{n+2}{4(n+8)}\\epsilon)$ is of order $\\epsilon^2$ and is dropped in this first-order calculation.\n    $\\alpha = 2 - \\left[ 2 + \\frac{n+2}{n+8}\\epsilon - \\frac{1}{2}\\epsilon \\right] + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n    $\\alpha = -\\left( \\frac{n+2}{n+8} - \\frac{1}{2} \\right)\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n    Combining the fractions inside the parenthesis:\n    $\\alpha = -\\left( \\frac{2(n+2) - 1(n+8)}{2(n+8)} \\right)\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n    $\\alpha = -\\left( \\frac{2n + 4 - n - 8}{2(n+8)} \\right)\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n    $\\alpha = -\\left( \\frac{n - 4}{2(n+8)} \\right)\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n    This simplifies to the general first-order expression for $\\alpha$:\n    $\\alpha = \\frac{4-n}{2(n+8)}\\epsilon$\n\n6.  **Specialize to the System in Question:** The problem is for a system with $d=3$, so we set $\\epsilon = 4 - 3 = 1$. The value of $n$ is not specified. In such cases, it is standard practice to assume the most fundamental model, the Ising model, for which the order parameter is a scalar, meaning $n=1$.\n\n7.  **Final Calculation:** Substitute $\\epsilon=1$ and $n=1$ into the derived formula for $\\alpha$:\n    $\\alpha \\approx \\frac{4-1}{2(1+8)} = \\frac{3}{2(9)} = \\frac{3}{18} = \\frac{1}{6}$\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Model Dependence:** The result depends on $n$, the number of components of the order parameter. The ambiguity of the question requires making a reasonable assumption, which is to use the Ising model ($n=1$).\n*   **Order of Expansion:** The calculation is performed to the first order in $\\epsilon$. This is an approximation. Higher-order terms ($O(\\epsilon^2)$, etc.) would provide a more accurate result but are significantly more complex to calculate.\n*   **Approximation for $\\epsilon=1$:** The $\\epsilon$-expansion is formally an asymptotic series, most accurate for $\\epsilon \\ll 1$. Setting $\\epsilon=1$ is a standard practice to get an estimate for 3-dimensional systems, but it should be understood as an approximation, not an exact result. The good agreement with experimental and numerical results for many exponents validates this approach.\n*   **Hyperscaling:** The validity of the hyperscaling relation $2-\\alpha = d\\nu$ is assumed. This relation holds for dimensions $d \\le d_c$. Since we are at $d=3 < d_c=4$, its use is justified.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nFollowing the steps above, the scaling exponent $\\alpha$ is calculated as:\n1.  Start with the hyperscaling relation: $\\alpha = 2 - d\\nu$\n2.  Use $d=4-\\epsilon$ and the one-loop result $\\nu = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{n+2}{4(n+8)}\\epsilon$.\n3.  The calculation to first order in $\\epsilon$ yields $\\alpha = \\frac{4-n}{2(n+8)}\\epsilon$.\n4.  For the $d=3$ case, set $\\epsilon=1$.\n5.  Assuming the Ising model universality class ($n=1$), we get $\\alpha = \\frac{4-1}{2(1+8)} = \\frac{3}{18} = \\frac{1}{6}$.\n\n<<<1/6>>>"
