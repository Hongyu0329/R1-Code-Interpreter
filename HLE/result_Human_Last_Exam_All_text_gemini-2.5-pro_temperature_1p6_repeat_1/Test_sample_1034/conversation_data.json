    "This problem asks for the number of integer values of side AC in a triangle ABC, given that side BC = S and angle B = 30°, for which there are two possible lengths for side AB.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis of the Problem\n\n1.  **Identify Given Information**: We are given a triangle ABC with:\n    *   Side `BC = S`. The variable `S` is given as `SNYWR`, which in the context of AIME refers to the answer of the preceding problem. The answer to AIME 2024 I Problem 1 is 141. So, we set `S = 141`.\n    *   `BC = a = 141`.\n    *   Angle `B = 30°`.\n    *   Side `AC = b` is the side whose integer values we are counting.\n    *   Side `AB = c` is the side for which there are two possible values.\n\n2.  **Translate the Condition**: The condition \"two possible values for side length AB\" means that given side `a`, angle `B`, and side `b`, two distinct triangles can be formed. This is the classic \"ambiguous case\" of the Law of Sines, often referred to as the SSA (Side-Side-Angle) case.\n\n3.  **Choose a Method of Solution**: We can solve this using either the Law of Sines (geometric/trigonometric approach) or the Law of Cosines (algebraic approach). Both should yield the same result.\n\n### Method 1: Using the Law of Sines\n\n1.  **Apply the Law of Sines**: In triangle ABC, the Law of Sines states:\n    `a/sin(A) = b/sin(B) = c/sin(C)`\n    Substituting the known values:\n    `141 / sin(A) = b / sin(30°)`\n\n2.  **Solve for sin(A)**:\n    `sin(A) = (141 * sin(30°)) / b`\n    Since `sin(30°) = 0.5`, this simplifies to:\n    `sin(A) = (141 * 0.5) / b = 70.5 / b`\n\n3.  **Establish Conditions for Two Triangles**:\n    For two distinct triangles to exist, there must be two possible values for angle A. This occurs if and only if `0 < sin(A) < 1`.\n    *   If `sin(A) > 1`, no triangle exists.\n    *   If `sin(A) = 1`, exactly one triangle (a right triangle) exists.\n    *   If `sin(A) < 0`, it's impossible as A is an angle in a triangle.\n\n    The condition `0 < sin(A) < 1` gives us `0 < 70.5 / b < 1`.\n    Since `b` is a side length, `b > 0`, so the `0 < 70.5 / b` part is always true. We only need to consider:\n    `70.5 / b < 1  =>  b > 70.5`\n\n    Additionally, for two triangles to be possible, both potential angles for A must result in a valid triangle. Let the two angles be `A₁` (acute) and `A₂ = 180° - A₁` (obtuse). For each, the sum of angles must be less than 180°.\n    *   For `A₁`: `A₁ + B < 180°`. Since `A₁` is acute (`< 90°`) and `B = 30°`, their sum is less than `120°`, so a triangle is always possible.\n    *   For `A₂`: `A₂ + B < 180°`. Substituting `A₂ = 180° - A₁` and `B = 30°`:\n        `(180° - A₁) + 30° < 180°`\n        `210° - A₁ < 180°`\n        `30° < A₁`\n\n    Since `A₁` is an acute angle, `sin(A₁)` is an increasing function. The condition `A₁ > 30°` is equivalent to `sin(A₁) > sin(30°)`.\n    `70.5 / b > 0.5`\n    `70.5 > 0.5 * b`\n    `141 > b`\n\n4.  **Combine the Conditions**: To have two possible triangles, `b` must satisfy both `b > 70.5` and `b < 141`. So, the range for `b` is:\n    `70.5 < b < 141`\n\n### Method 2: Using the Law of Cosines\n\n1.  **Apply the Law of Cosines**: We can relate the sides `a`, `b`, `c` and angle `B`:\n    `b² = a² + c² - 2ac * cos(B)`\n    Substituting the known values `a = 141` and `B = 30°` (`cos(30°) = sqrt(3)/2`):\n    `b² = 141² + c² - 2 * 141 * c * (sqrt(3)/2)`\n    `b² = 141² + c² - 141 * sqrt(3) * c`\n\n2.  **Form a Quadratic Equation for c**: Rearrange the equation into a standard quadratic form `Ax² + Bx + C = 0` where the variable is `c`:\n    `c² - (141 * sqrt(3)) * c + (141² - b²) = 0`\n\n3.  **Establish Conditions for Two Solutions**: The condition that there are \"two possible values for side length AB\" means this quadratic equation must have two distinct, positive, real roots for `c`.\n    *   **Distinct Real Roots**: The discriminant (`Δ`) must be positive (`Δ > 0`).\n        `Δ = (-(141 * sqrt(3)))² - 4 * 1 * (141² - b²)`\n        `Δ = 3 * 141² - 4 * 141² + 4b²`\n        `Δ = 4b² - 141²`\n        The condition `Δ > 0` implies `4b² - 141² > 0`, so `4b² > 141²`, which means `2b > 141`, or `b > 70.5`.\n\n    *   **Positive Roots**: For a quadratic equation with real roots, if the sum of roots is positive and the product of roots is positive, then both roots must be positive.\n        *   **Sum of roots**: `c₁ + c₂ = -(-141 * sqrt(3)) / 1 = 141 * sqrt(3)`. This is positive.\n        *   **Product of roots**: `c₁ * c₂ = (141² - b²) / 1`. This must be positive.\n          `141² - b² > 0`\n          `141² > b²`\n          Since `b > 0`, this means `b < 141`.\n\n4.  **Combine the Conditions**: Both conditions must hold, so `b > 70.5` and `b < 141`. This confirms the result from Method 1.\n    `70.5 < b < 141`\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Source of S**: The value of `S` is crucial and must be determined from the context of the competition (AIME 2024 I), where it is the answer to the previous problem. `S=141`.\n*   **Ambiguous Case Conditions**: The condition for two triangles in the SSA case (given `a, b, B`) is `a * sin(B) < b < a`. In our problem, this translates to `141 * sin(30°) < b < 141`, which is `70.5 < b < 141`. This is a quick way to verify the result.\n*   **Integer Values**: The question specifically asks for the number of *integer* values of `AC` (`b`).\n*   **Counting Integers**: When counting integers in an interval `(x, y)`, the count is `floor(y-1) - ceil(x) + 1`.\n\n### Final Calculation\n\nWe need to find the number of integers `b` in the interval `(70.5, 141)`.\n*   The smallest integer greater than 70.5 is 71.\n*   The largest integer less than 141 is 140.\nThe integers are `71, 72, ..., 140`. To count them, we use the formula: `Last - First + 1`.\nNumber of integer values = `140 - 71 + 1 = 69 + 1 = 70`.\n\nThere are 70 such integer values for the length of side AC.\n\n<<<70>>>"
