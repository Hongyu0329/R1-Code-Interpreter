    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer:\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the question**\nThe core components of the question are:\n*   **Artwork:** \"The Radionist\"\n*   **Artist:** Kurt Günther\n*   **Medium:** Tempera painting\n*   **Year of creation:** 1927\n*   **Year of acquisition:** 1967\n*   **The unknown:** The acquiring museum\n\n**Step 2: Initial Research Strategy**\nThe most effective way to find this information is to search for the artwork's provenance (its history of ownership). The key search terms will be the artist's name and the title of the painting, both in English (\"The Radionist\") and its original German (\"Der Radionist\").\n\n**Step 3: Execution of Research and Analysis of Findings**\n*   A search for \"Kurt Günther Der Radionist\" or \"Kurt Günther The Radionist\" quickly identifies the painting as a significant work of the \"New Objectivity\" (Neue Sachlichkeit) movement in Germany.\n*   Multiple sources, including museum databases, art history websites, and encyclopedias, link the painting to a specific museum in Germany. Kurt Günther lived and worked for a significant period in Altenburg, Thuringia, which makes the local museum a strong candidate.\n*   The museum repeatedly associated with this work is the **Lindenau-Museum Altenburg**.\n*   The final step is to verify the acquisition date. Museum collection databases and scholarly records (such as Germany's Bildindex der Kunst & Architektur) for the painting often list its inventory number (Inv.-Nr. G 1318) and its acquisition history. These records explicitly state that the Lindenau-Museum Altenburg acquired the painting in 1967.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n*   **Original Title:** Using the German title \"Der Radionist\" is crucial as it is more likely to yield precise results from German museum sources.\n*   **Artist's Biography:** Knowing that Kurt Günther was based in Altenburg provides a strong geographical clue that points toward the Lindenau-Museum.\n*   **Source Verification:** It is important to rely on official museum sources, academic art databases, or reputable art history publications rather than unverified online galleries or blogs. These reliable sources confirm both the location and the 1967 acquisition date.\n*   **Specificity of the Question:** The question is not just \"where is the painting now?\" but specifically \"who acquired it in 1967?\". The answer must address this specific event. The evidence confirms the Lindenau-Museum was the institution that performed this acquisition.\n\n**Conclusion**\nBased on the step-by-step analysis of reliable sources, the 1927 tempera painting \"The Radionist\" by Kurt Günther was acquired by the Lindenau-Museum Altenburg in 1967.\n\n<<<Lindenau-Museum Altenburg>>>"
