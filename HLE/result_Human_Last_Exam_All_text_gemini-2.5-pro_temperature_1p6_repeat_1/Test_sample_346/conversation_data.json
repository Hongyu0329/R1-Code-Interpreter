    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the given SKI combinator expression.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe question asks to find the value of `log_2(n)` where `n` is the Church integer represented by the given SKI expression. This requires us to:\na. Decode the structure of the SKI expression.\nb. Identify the arithmetic operations the combinators represent.\nc. Evaluate the expression to find the Church integer `c_n`.\nd. Calculate `n` and then `log_2(n)`.\n\n**2. SKI Combinator Rules and Church Numerals**\nFirst, let's recall the basic rules and representations:\n*   **S x y z = x z (y z)**\n*   **K x y = x**\n*   **I x = x**\n*   A Church numeral `c_n` is a function that takes `f` and `x` and applies `f` to `x`, `n` times: `c_n f x = f^n(x)`.\n*   `c_1 = λf.λx. f x = I` in some contexts, but more accurately `λf.f`, which is `I`. So `c_1 = I`.\n*   `c_2 = λf.λx. f(f x)`. Let's derive its SKI form: `c_2 f x = S I I f x = I f (I f) x = f (f x)`. Thus, **`S(I)(I) = c_2`**.\n\n**3. Deconstruct the Main Expression**\nThe expression is `E = S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(S(S(K(S))(K))(I)))))(S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I))))`.\n\nLet's break this down into components. Notice the repeating `S(I)` structure.\nLet `Ψ = S(I)`. The reduction rule for `Ψ` is `Ψ x y = (S I) x y = I y (x y) = y (x y)`.\nLet the two main arguments be `A'` and `B'`:\n*   `A' = S(I)(S(I)(K(...)))`\n*   `B' = S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I))`\nThe expression is `E = Ψ A' B' = B'(A' B')`.\n\nLet's trace the nested application:\n*   Let `g = S(I)`. Let `E = g(g(g A)) B`.\n*   Using `g x y = y(xy)`, we can expand this from the outside in:\n    `E = B ( (g(g A)) B )`\n    `E = B ( B ( (g A) B ) )`\n    `E = B ( B ( B ( A B ) ) )`\nThis means the expression `E` represents applying the function `B` three times, starting with the initial value `A B`. `E = B^3(A B)`.\n\n**4. Analyze the Sub-Expressions `A` and `B`**\n\nLet's identify the combinators inside `A` and `B`.\nThe term `S(K(S))(K)` appears in both. Let's call it `B_op`.\n*   **`B_op` = `S(K(S))(K)`**: Let's find its function.\n    `S(K(S))(K) x y z = (K(S) x) (K x) y z = S (K x) y z = (K x z) (y z) = x (y z)`.\n    This is the **`B` combinator (the Bluebird)**, which represents function composition. When applied to Church numerals, it represents multiplication: `B_op c_m c_n f = c_m(c_n f) = (f^n)^m = f^(n*m)`. So **`B_op c_m c_n = c_{n*m}`**.\n\nThe term `S(S(K(S))(K))` also appears. Let's call it `P`.\n*   **`P` = `S(B_op)`**: This is the `S` combinator applied to our multiplication combinator `B_op`. Let's see what `P` does to two Church numerals, `c_m` and `c_n`.\n    `P c_m c_n = (S B_op) c_m c_n = B_op c_m (c_n c_m)`.\n    `c_n c_m` is the exponentiation `POW c_n c_m`, which evaluates to `c_{m^n}`.\n    So, `P c_m c_n = B_op c_m (c_{m^n})`. Since `B_op` is multiplication, this is `c_{(m^n) * m} = c_{m^{n+1}}`.\n    So, the combinator **`P` represents the operation `(m, n) -> m^(n+1)`**.\n\nNow we can define the expressions for `A` and `B` from `E = B(B(B(AB)))`:\n*   **`A = K(P I)`**: Here `I` is `c_1`. `P I` means `P c_1`.\n    `P c_1 = λn. c_{1^{n+1}} = λn. c_1`. This is a function that ignores its argument `n` and always returns `c_1`. This is the definition of `K c_1`.\n    So, `A = K(K c_1)`.\n*   **`B = P (S I I)`**: We already know `S I I = c_2`.\n    So `B = P c_2`. This is a function waiting for its second argument, `n`.\n    `B = λn. P(c_2, n) = λn. c_{2^{n+1}}`.\n\n**5. Evaluate the Final Expression `E = B(B(B(AB)))`**\n\nWe will evaluate this from the inside out.\n\n*   **Step 1: Calculate `A B`**\n    `A B = (K (K c_1)) B = K c_1`.\n    The `K` combinator discards its second argument (`B`).\n\n*   **Step 2: Calculate `B(A B) = B(K c_1)`**\n    This means we apply the function `B` to the argument `K c_1`.\n    `B(K c_1)` is `(λn. c_{2^{n+1}})(K c_1)`. We set `n = K c_1`.\n    So we need to evaluate `P(c_2, K c_1)`.\n    `P(c_2, K c_1) = (S B_op) c_2 (K c_1) = B_op c_2 ( (K c_1) c_2 )`.\n    `(K c_1) c_2 = c_1`.\n    So, `B_op c_2 c_1`. This is multiplication, giving `c_{1*2} = c_2`.\n    Result of Step 2: `c_2`.\n\n*   **Step 3: Calculate `B(B(A B)) = B(c_2)`**\n    This means we apply the function `B` to the argument `c_2`.\n    `B(c_2)` is `(λn. c_{2^{n+1}})(c_2)`. We set `n = c_2`.\n    This gives `c_{2^{2+1}} = c_{2^3} = c_8`.\n    Result of Step 3: `c_8`.\n\n*   **Step 4: Calculate `B(B(B(A B))) = B(c_8)`**\n    This means we apply the function `B` to the argument `c_8`.\n    `B(c_8)` is `(λn. c_{2^{n+1}})(c_8)`. We set `n = c_8`.\n    This gives `c_{2^{8+1}} = c_{2^9}`.\n    Result of Step 4: `c_{2^9}`.\n\n**6. Final Calculation**\nThe given SKI expression is equivalent to the Church numeral for `2^9`.\nSo, `n = 2^9`.\nThe question asks for `log_2(n)`.\n`log_2(n) = log_2(2^9) = 9`."
