The inability to see a resonance in a functional MRI coil with a VNA and a loop probe is typically due to one or more of the following design features:
1.  **Active Decoupling Circuits:** The coil contains PIN diodes for protection during the high-power transmit pulse. Without the necessary DC control signals from the scanner, these circuits often default to a "safe," detuned, or non-resonant state on the bench.
2.  **Integrated RF Shielding:** Many coils have a built-in RF shield to block external noise and improve SNR. This shield also blocks the magnetic field from your external probe, preventing it from coupling to the coil's resonant elements.
3.  **Complex Coil Geometry:** The coil may have a specific geometry, such as a gradiometer (figure-8) design, which is made to cancel out the uniform magnetic fields produced by distant noise sources. Your probe's field may be seen as such a field and be rejected by the coil.
4.  **Unpowered Preamplifier:** The coil is tuned and matched to its integrated low-noise preamplifier. When unpowered on the bench, the preamp presents an incorrect impedance that heavily damps the coil, making its resonance too weak or broad to be detected.
In essence, the coil is functional because these systems work as intended inside the MRI scanner, but the bench test fails to replicate the necessary operating conditions.
