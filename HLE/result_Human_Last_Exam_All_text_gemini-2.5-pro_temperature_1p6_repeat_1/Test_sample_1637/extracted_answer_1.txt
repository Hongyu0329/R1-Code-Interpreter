Yes, changing the amide group to a PEG group is very likely to solve the precipitation problem. The large, hydrophobic thioxanthone core and hexyl chain make the original probe poorly soluble in the aqueous cell culture medium. Furthermore, the amide group can participate in intermolecular hydrogen bonding, and the flat aromatic core can pi-stack, both of which promote aggregation and precipitation. Replacing the amide-containing linker with a poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) chain would have two beneficial effects: 1) It removes the amide group, a potential source of aggregation. 2) It introduces a highly hydrophilic and flexible PEG chain, which is a standard and very effective method for increasing the aqueous solubility of hydrophobic compounds and sterically preventing them from aggregating. This modification directly addresses the underlying causes of the precipitation.
