    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rule activation level.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to find the \"rule activation level\". In the context of a fuzzy inference system, this refers to the result of the fuzzy implication step for a single rule. This step combines the firing strength of the rule's antecedent (the \"IF\" part) with the membership function of the rule's consequent (the \"THEN\" part).\n\n2.  **Identify the Inputs:**\n    *   **Antecedent Firing Level (`Phi_k(x')`):** This value represents the degree to which the input `x'` satisfies the antecedent condition of the *k*-th rule. The problem provides this value as `0.7`.\n    *   **Consequent Membership (`μG_k_j(y_j)`):** This value represents the membership grade of a specific output value `y_j` in the consequent fuzzy set `G_k` for the *k*-th rule. The problem provides this as `0.9`.\n\n3.  **Identify the Operation:**\n    *   The problem specifies that a **t-norm operation** should be used. A t-norm (triangular norm) is a type of function used to model fuzzy intersection (the logical AND). In fuzzy implication, a t-norm is used to scale or clip the consequent fuzzy set based on the antecedent's firing strength.\n\n4.  **Consider the Type of Fuzzy Set:**\n    *   The question mentions an **Interval Type-3 Fuzzy Set (IT3FS)**. While the full theory of IT3FSs is complex, involving nested levels of uncertainty, the problem simplifies the calculation by providing single, crisp values for the antecedent firing level and the consequent membership. In practical applications and for specific calculations like this, these crisp values often represent the upper bounds of the respective fuzzy memberships. The fundamental operation of implication remains the same, applied to these representative values.\n\n5.  **Select a Specific T-Norm:**\n    *   The problem does not specify *which* t-norm to use. The two most common t-norms used for fuzzy implication are:\n        *   **Minimum (min) t-norm:** `T(a, b) = min(a, b)`. This is the most widely used t-norm for implication in Mamdani-type fuzzy systems.\n        *   **Product (prod) t-norm:** `T(a, b) = a * b`. This is used in Larsen-type fuzzy systems.\n    *   In the absence of specific instructions, the **minimum (min)** t-norm is the standard and most common assumption. We will proceed using the `min` operator.\n\n6.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    *   The rule activation level is calculated by applying the chosen t-norm to the antecedent firing level and the consequent membership.\n    *   Rule Activation Level = `t-norm(Phi_k(x'), μG_k_j(y_j))`\n    *   Using the minimum t-norm:\n    *   Rule Activation Level = `min(0.7, 0.9)`\n    *   Rule Activation Level = `0.7`\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **T-Norm Choice:** The final answer depends directly on the t-norm used. While `min` is the most common, if the `product` t-norm were used, the answer would be `0.7 * 0.9 = 0.63`. The `min` operator is the standard interpretation for Mamdani implication.\n*   **Interpretation of \"Activation Level\":** The antecedent firing strength (0.7) acts as a cap on the consequent. The consequent's original membership at `y_j` is 0.9, but since the rule itself is only fired to a degree of 0.7, the resulting \"activated\" membership cannot exceed this value. Therefore, the activated membership is clipped at 0.7.\n*   **Role of IT3FS:** The fact that the problem involves IT3FSs provides context but doesn't complicate this specific calculation because simplified scalar inputs are given. The result `0.7` would represent the corresponding (likely, upper) bound of the resulting activated consequent IT3FS.\n\n### Final Answer Calculation\n\nApplying the standard `min` t-norm for fuzzy implication:\n*   Input 1 (Antecedent Firing Level): 0.7\n*   Input 2 (Consequent Membership): 0.9\n*   Operation: `min(0.7, 0.9)`\n*   Result: `0.7`\n\n<<<0.7>>>"
