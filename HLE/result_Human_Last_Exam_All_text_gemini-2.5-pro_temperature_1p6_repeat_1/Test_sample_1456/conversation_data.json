    "Answering this question requires understanding the definitions of several key concepts in topology, specifically in continuum theory, and knowing some fundamental theorems that relate them.\n\n### Step 1: Define the Key Terms\n\n1.  **Continuum:** A continuum is a compact, connected metric space.\n2.  **Nondegenerate Continuum:** A continuum that consists of more than one point. Examples include a line segment `[0, 1]`, a circle, or a square. A single point is a degenerate continuum.\n3.  **Subcontinuum:** A subset of a continuum that is itself a continuum. A **proper subcontinuum** of a continuum $K$ is a subcontinuum that is not equal to $K$.\n4.  **Decomposable vs. Indecomposable Continuum:** A continuum $K$ is called **decomposable** if it can be written as the union of two of its proper subcontinua. If it cannot be so written, it is called **indecomposable**. For instance, the segment `[0,1]` is decomposable since `[0,1] = [0, 2/3] U [1/3, 1]`. Examples of indecomposable continua include the bucket-handle continuum and the pseudo-arc.\n5.  **Composant:** For a point $p$ in a continuum $K$, its composant is the set of all points $q$ in $K$ such that there exists a proper subcontinuum of $K$ containing both $p$ and $q$. The relation \"being in the same composant\" is an equivalence relation, and the composants are the equivalence classes. Thus, the set of all composants of a continuum forms a partition of it.\n\n### Step 2: Relate Number of Composants to Decomposability\n\nThere is a fundamental theorem in continuum theory that classifies continua based on their number of composants.\n\n*   **Theorem:** A nondegenerate continuum has exactly **one** composant if and only if it is **decomposable**.\n*   **Theorem:** A nondegenerate continuum has **uncountably many** composants if and only if it is **indecomposable**. The cardinality of the set of composants in this case is $\\mathfrak{c}$ (the cardinality of the continuum, i.e., $2^{\\aleph_0}$).\n\nTherefore, the number of composants of any nondegenerate continuum can only be 1 or $\\mathfrak{c}$. To find the largest possible number, we need to determine if it's possible for the product of two nondegenerate continua to have $\\mathfrak{c}$ composants.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Product of Two Continua\n\nLet $X$ and $Y$ be two nondegenerate continua. We are interested in their product, $Z = X \\times Y$.\n\n1.  **The product of continua is a continuum:** If $X$ and $Y$ are compact and connected, their product $X \\times Y$ (with the product topology) is also compact (by Tychonoff's theorem) and connected. If $X$ and $Y$ are metric, so is their product. Thus, $Z = X \\times Y$ is a continuum. Since $X$ and $Y$ are nondegenerate, $Z$ is also nondegenerate.\n\n2.  **Decomposability of the product:** We need to know when $Z = X \\times Y$ is indecomposable, as this is the condition for it to have the maximum number of composants. Another key theorem from continuum theory provides the answer.\n\n    *   **Theorem (Kuratowski):** The Cartesian product $X \\times Y$ of two continua is indecomposable if and only if both $X$ and $Y$ are indecomposable.\n\n    This means that if either $X$ or $Y$ (or both) are decomposable, the product $X \\times Y$ is decomposable.\n\n### Step 4: Synthesize to Find the Maximum Number\n\nThe question asks for the *largest possible* number of composants for the product $X \\times Y$. We have the freedom to choose any two nondegenerate continua for $X$ and $Y$.\n\n*   **Scenario 1: Choose decomposable continua.** Let $X = [0,1]$ and $Y = [0,1]$. Both are nondegenerate and decomposable continua. According to the theorem, their product, the square $Z = [0,1] \\times [0,1]$, is decomposable. Therefore, the number of composants of the square is 1.\n\n*   **Scenario 2: Choose indecomposable continua.** To get the largest number of composants for $Z = X \\times Y$, we need $Z$ to be indecomposable. This requires both $X$ and $Y$ to be indecomposable. We must verify that such continua exist. As mentioned, they do; the **pseudo-arc** is a classic example of a nondegenerate indecomposable continuum.\n\n    Let's choose $X$ to be a pseudo-arc and $Y$ to be a pseudo-arc.\n    *   Both are nondegenerate continua.\n    *   Both are indecomposable.\n    *   According to the theorem, their product $Z = X \\times Y$ is an indecomposable continuum.\n    *   Since $Z$ is a nondegenerate indecomposable continuum, it has $\\mathfrak{c}$ composants.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe number of composants of the product of two nondegenerate continua can be either 1 or $\\mathfrak{c}$. Since we are looking for the largest possible number, the answer is $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n\n*   **Careful point 1:** The condition that the continua are \"nondegenerate\" is crucial. The theorems about the number of composants are typically stated for nondegenerate continua.\n*   **Careful point 2:** The existence of indecomposable continua is a non-trivial fact of topology, but it is a well-established one.\n*   **Careful point 3:** The theorem on the decomposability of a product space is the central tool that connects the properties of the factors to the property of the product.\n\nThe largest possible number of composants is the cardinality of the continuum.\n\n<<<c>>>"
