The conditions are: 1. The sets X, Y, and Z must be complete metric spaces. 2. The functions F, G, and H must satisfy a set of linear contractive inequalities with non-negative coefficients `a_i, b_i, c_i`. 3. The sum of these coefficients must satisfy the global contraction condition `max { (a₁ + b₂ + c₃), (a₂ + b₁ + c₂), (a₃ + c₁) } < 1`.
