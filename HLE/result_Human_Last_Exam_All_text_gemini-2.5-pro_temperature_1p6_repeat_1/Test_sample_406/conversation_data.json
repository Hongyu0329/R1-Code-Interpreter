    "The problem asks for the conditions for the existence of an \"FGH-tripled fixed point\". This is a concept from the field of fixed-point theory in mathematics, specifically for systems of mappings on product spaces. The conditions are typically given by an extension of the well-known Banach Fixed-Point Theorem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Clarifying Definitions and Setup**\n\nFirst, we must establish the mathematical setting and define the key terms.\n\n*   **Spaces:** Let `(X, d_X)`, `(Y, d_Y)`, and `(Z, d_Z)` be three metric spaces. The core condition for fixed-point existence theorems is that these spaces must be **complete**. A complete metric space is one in which every Cauchy sequence converges to a point within the space.\n*   **Functions:** We are given three functions with specific domains and codomains:\n    *   `F: X × Y × Z → X`\n    *   `G: Y × X × Y → Y`\n    *   `H: Z × Y × X → Z`\n    *   **Careful Point:** The question lists `G: Z*Y*X→Z` for the third function, which is likely a typo. The term \"FGH-tripled\" strongly implies three distinct functions F, G, and H. We will proceed assuming the third function is `H: Z × Y × X → Z`, as this aligns with the naming convention.\n*   **FGH-Tripled Fixed Point:** An \"FGH-tripled fixed point\" is a triplet of points `(x, y, z)`, where `x ∈ X`, `y ∈ Y`, `z ∈ Z`, that simultaneously satisfies the following system of equations:\n    1.  `x = F(x, y, z)`\n    2.  `y = G(y, x, y)`\n    3.  `z = H(z, y, x)`\n    Notice how the arguments in each function correspond to the defined domains and result in the fixed point for that component.\n\n**Step 2: The Contraction Principle on the Product Space**\n\nThe existence and uniqueness of such a fixed point can be guaranteed if the system of functions collectively acts as a **contraction mapping** on the product space `W = X × Y × Z`.\n\nWe can define a single operator `T: W → W` as:\n`T(x, y, z) = (F(x, y, z), G(y, x, y), H(z, y, x))`\n\nA fixed point of `T` is a point `(x, y, z)` such that `T(x, y, z) = (x, y, z)`, which is exactly the definition of an FGH-tripled fixed point.\n\nAccording to the Banach Fixed-Point Theorem, if `(W, d)` is a complete metric space and `T: W → W` is a contraction mapping, then `T` has a unique fixed point. The product space `W` is complete if `X`, `Y`, and `Z` are complete. The metric `d` on `W` can be defined, for example, as `d((x₁, y₁, z₁), (x₂, y₂, z₂)) = d_X(x₁, x₂) + d_Y(y₁, y₂) + d_Z(z₁, z₂)`.\n\nThe main task is to state the conditions on F, G, and H that ensure `T` is a contraction. A mapping `T` is a contraction if there exists a constant `k ∈ [0, 1)` such that `d(T(w₁), T(w₂)) ≤ k * d(w₁, w₂)` for all `w₁, w₂ ∈ W`.\n\n**Step 3: Deriving the Specific Conditions for F, G, and H**\n\nInstead of a single abstract condition on `T`, it is more practical to impose separate contractive-type conditions on F, G, and H. These conditions must ensure that the combined operator `T` is a contraction.\n\nLet `x₁, x₂ ∈ X`, `y₁, y₂ ∈ Y`, and `z₁, z₂ ∈ Z`. The conditions are as follows:\n\nSuppose there exist nine non-negative constants `a₁, a₂, a₃`, `b₁, b₂`, and `c₁, c₂, c₃` such that:\n\n1.  **Condition on F:** The distance between the outputs of `F` is bounded by a linear combination of the distances between its inputs.\n    `d_X(F(x₁, y₁, z₁), F(x₂, y₂, z₂)) ≤ a₁·d_X(x₁, x₂) + a₂·d_Y(y₁, y₂) + a₃·d_Z(z₁, z₂)`\n\n2.  **Condition on G:** Similarly for `G`, noting its specific arguments `(y, x, y)`.\n    `d_Y(G(y₁, x₁, y₁), G(y₂, x₂, y₂)) ≤ b₁·d_Y(y₁, y₂) + b₂·d_X(x₁, x₂)`\n\n3.  **Condition on H:** Similarly for `H`, noting its specific arguments `(z, y, x)`.\n    `d_Z(H(z₁, y₁, x₁), H(z₂, y₂, x₂)) ≤ c₁·d_Z(z₁, z₂) + c₂·d_Y(y₁, y₂) + c₃·d_X(x₁, x₂)`\n\n**Step 4: The Global Contraction Condition**\n\nThe individual conditions above are not sufficient on their own. They must be tied together by a global condition on the coefficients to ensure the overall mapping `T` is a contraction. We achieve this by summing the inequalities and ensuring the total \"shrinkage\" factor is less than 1.\n\nSumming the right-hand sides of the inequalities gives an upper bound for `d(T(w₁), T(w₂))`:\n`d(T(w₁), T(w₂)) ≤ (a₁ + b₂ + c₃)d_X(x₁, x₂) + (a₂ + b₁ + c₂)d_Y(y₁, y₂) + (a₃ + c₁)d_Z(z₁, z₂)`\n\nFor this to be a contraction, we need `(a₁ + b₂ + c₃) < 1`, `(a₂ + b₁ + c₂) < 1`, and `(a₃ + c₁) < 1`. A more concise way to state this is:\n\n`max { (a₁ + b₂ + c₃), (a₂ + b₁ + c₂), (a₃ + c₁) } < 1`\n\nLet this maximum value be `k`. Then `k < 1`, and `d(T(w₁), T(w₂)) ≤ k * d(w₁, w₂)`. This proves `T` is a contraction.\n\n### Final Answer: Summary of Conditions\n\nHere are the conditions for the functions `F: X×Y×Z → X`, `G: Y×X×Y → Y`, and `H: Z×Y×X → Z` to have a unique FGH-tripled fixed point.\n\n1.  **Metric Space Condition:** `(X, d_X)`, `(Y, d_Y)`, and `(Z, d_Z)` must be **complete metric spaces**.\n\n2.  **Component-wise Contractive Conditions:** There must exist non-negative real constants `a₁, a₂, a₃, b₁, b₂, c₁, c₂, c₃` such that for all `x₁, x₂ ∈ X`, `y₁, y₂ ∈ Y`, and `z₁, z₂ ∈ Z`, the following inequalities hold:\n    *   `d_X(F(x₁, y₁, z₁), F(x₂, y₂, z₂)) ≤ a₁·d_X(x₁, x₂) + a₂·d_Y(y₁, y₂) + a₃·d_Z(z₁, z₂)`\n    *   `d_Y(G(y₁, x₁, y₁), G(y₂, x₂, y₂)) ≤ b₁·d_Y(y₁, y₂) + b₂·d_X(x₁, x₂)`\n    *   `d_Z(H(z₁, y₁, x₁), H(z₂, y₂, x₂)) ≤ c₁·d_Z(z₁, z₂) + c₂·d_Y(y₁, y₂) + c₃·d_X(x₁, x₂)`\n\n3.  **Global Contraction Condition:** The sum of the coefficients associated with each component's distance must be less than 1. Specifically, the maximum of these sums must be less than 1:\n    *   `max { (a₁ + b₂ + c₃), (a₂ + b₁ + c₂), (a₃ + c₁) } < 1`\n\nIf all these conditions are satisfied, then there exists a unique FGH-tripled fixed point `(x, y, z) ∈ X × Y × Z`.\n\n<<<The conditions are: 1. The sets X, Y, and Z must be complete metric spaces. 2. The functions F, G, and H must satisfy a set of linear contractive inequalities with non-negative coefficients `a_i, b_i, c_i`. 3. The sum of these coefficients must satisfy the global contraction condition `max { (a₁ + b₂ + c₃), (a₂ + b₁ + c₂), (a₃ + c₁) } < 1`.>>>"
