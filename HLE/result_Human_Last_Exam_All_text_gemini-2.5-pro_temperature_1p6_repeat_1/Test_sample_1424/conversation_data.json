    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Defining the Bare Green's Function ($G_0$)**\n\nThe Green's function in many-body physics, also known as a propagator, describes the probability amplitude for a particle (or excitation) to travel from one spacetime point to another. The \"bare\" or \"non-interacting\" Green's function, denoted as $G_0$, describes this propagation in a system without particle-particle interactions. The Hamiltonian for such a system, $H_0$, is purely a sum of single-particle operators.\n\nIn the Feynman path integral formalism, the time-ordered Green's function for fermions is defined via a functional integral over anticommuting (Grassmann) fields $\\psi$ and $\\psi^\\dagger$:\n\n$G_0(x, t; x', t') = \\frac{\\int \\mathcal{D}[\\psi^\\dagger, \\psi] \\, \\psi(x,t) \\psi^\\dagger(x',t') \\, e^{iS_0[\\psi^\\dagger, \\psi]}}{\\int \\mathcal{D}[\\psi^\\dagger, \\psi] \\, e^{iS_0[\\psi^\\dagger, \\psi]}}$\n\nHere, $S_0$ is the non-interacting action.\n\n**2. The Non-Interacting Action and its Eigenbasis**\n\nThe non-interacting action $S_0$ is determined by the single-particle Hamiltonian $H_0$:\n\n$S_0 = \\int dt \\int d^d x \\, \\psi^\\dagger(x, t) \\left( i\\hbar \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} - H_0 \\right) \\psi(x, t)$\n\nThe core of the problem is to understand how this relates to the single-particle energy eigenvalues, $\\epsilon_k$. These eigenvalues are defined by the time-independent Schrödinger equation for the single-particle Hamiltonian:\n\n$H_0 |k\\rangle = \\epsilon_k |k\\rangle$\n\nwhere $|k\\rangle$ are the single-particle energy eigenstates with corresponding wavefunctions $\\phi_k(x) = \\langle x | k \\rangle$.\n\n**3. Diagonalizing the Action**\n\nTo find the dependence on $\\epsilon_k$, the most direct method is to work in the basis where $H_0$ is diagonal. We can expand the field operator $\\psi(x,t)$ in terms of the energy eigenfunctions $\\phi_k(x)$ and corresponding time-dependent Grassmann-valued coefficients $c_k(t)$:\n\n$\\psi(x, t) = \\sum_k c_k(t) \\phi_k(x)$\n\nSubstituting this expansion into the action $S_0$ and using the orthonormality of the eigenfunctions ($\\int d^d x \\, \\phi_k^*(x) \\phi_j(x) = \\delta_{kj}$), the action simplifies and becomes diagonal in the index $k$:\n\n$S_0 = \\sum_k \\int dt \\, c_k^\\dagger(t) \\left( i\\hbar \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} - \\epsilon_k \\right) c_k(t)$\n\n**4. Transforming to Frequency-Momentum Space**\n\nThe analysis becomes even simpler if we perform a Fourier transform from the time domain to the frequency ($\\omega$) domain:\n\n$c_k(t) = \\int \\frac{d\\omega}{2\\pi} e^{-i\\omega t} c_k(\\omega)$\n\nThe time derivative term $i\\hbar \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}$ transforms into a multiplication by $\\hbar\\omega$. Substituting this into the action gives the form in the frequency-eigenstate basis $(k, \\omega)$:\n\n$S_0 = \\sum_k \\int \\frac{d\\omega}{2\\pi} \\, c_k^\\dagger(\\omega) \\left( \\hbar\\omega - \\epsilon_k \\right) c_k(\\omega)$\n\nThis form is now fully diagonal. The action is a sum of independent terms for each mode $(k, \\omega)$.\n\n**5. Calculating the Green's Function**\n\nThe Green's function in the $(k, \\omega)$ basis, $G_0(k, \\omega)$, is the two-point correlation function $\\langle c_k(\\omega) c_k^\\dagger(\\omega) \\rangle$. For a quadratic action of the form $\\int \\phi^* A \\phi$, the propagator (Green's function) is proportional to the inverse of the operator $A$.\n\nIn our case, the operator in the action is $(\\hbar\\omega - \\epsilon_k)$. Therefore, the Green's function must be proportional to its inverse:\n\n$G_0(k, \\omega) \\propto \\frac{1}{\\hbar\\omega - \\epsilon_k}$\n\n**6. The \"iε\" Prescription and Causality**\n\nA crucial detail in defining the Green's function is how to handle the singularity (pole) when $\\hbar\\omega = \\epsilon_k$. The time-ordering prescription in the Feynman path integral automatically leads to a specific way of handling this pole, which is equivalent to adding an infinitesimal imaginary part, $i\\epsilon$ (or $i\\delta$), to the denominator. This ensures causality. The sign of this infinitesimal term depends on whether the state $k$ is occupied or empty relative to the Fermi sea (defined by the chemical potential $\\mu$).\n\n*   For an **unoccupied state** ($\\epsilon_k > \\mu$): The pole is shifted slightly into the lower half of the complex $\\omega$-plane. This corresponds to particle propagation forward in time.\n*   For an **occupied state** ($\\epsilon_k < \\mu$): The pole is shifted into the upper half of the complex $\\omega$-plane. This corresponds to a hole propagating forward in time (or a particle propagating backward in time).\n\nThis leads to the full expression for the bare Feynman Green's function in the frequency-eigenstate representation:\n\n$G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\hbar\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\epsilon \\, \\text{sgn}(\\epsilon_k - \\mu)}$\nwhere $\\text{sgn}(x)$ is the sign function.\n\n### List of Careful Points\n\n1.  **Bare vs. Interacting:** This analysis is strictly for the **bare** Green's function ($G_0$). In an interacting system, the denominator would be modified by a self-energy term, $\\Sigma(k, \\omega)$, leading to the full Green's function $G(k,\\omega) = (\\hbar\\omega - \\epsilon_k - \\Sigma(k,\\omega))^{-1}$.\n2.  **Choice of Basis:** The simple inverse relationship is only apparent in the frequency-eigenstate $(k, \\omega)$ basis where the non-interacting Hamiltonian is diagonal. In real space and time, the relationship is more complex, involving a sum over all $k$.\n3.  **Formalism:** While the question specifies the path integral formalism, the final result for the propagator is identical to that derived from other methods like the equation of motion or canonical quantization. The path integral's strength is its direct link between the action and the propagator as an inverse operator.\n4.  **The $i\\epsilon$ Term:** This term is not a minor detail; it is essential for defining the propagator's analytic structure, which encodes the physics of causality and the difference between particle and hole propagation. It distinguishes the Feynman propagator from other Green's functions like the retarded or advanced ones.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nIn the Feynman path integral formalism, after transforming to the eigenbasis of the non-interacting Hamiltonian ($H_0$) and the frequency domain, the bare Green's function $G_0(k, \\omega)$ depends on the single-particle energy eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$ as the inverse of a linear term. Specifically, the energy eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$ defines the location of a simple pole in the Green's function as a function of frequency (or energy) $\\omega$. The functional form is:\n\n$G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\hbar\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\delta}$\n\nwhere $\\omega$ is the frequency variable, $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant, and $i\\delta$ is an infinitesimal imaginary term that shifts the pole off the real axis to enforce causality. This shows that $G_0$ has an inverse linear dependence on the term $(\\hbar\\omega - \\epsilon_k)$.\n\n<<<In the frequency-eigenstate representation $(k, \\omega)$, the bare Green's function $G_0(k, \\omega)$ is inversely proportional to the term $(\\hbar\\omega - \\epsilon_k)$. The single-particle energy eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$ determines the position of a simple pole of the Green's function in the complex frequency plane. The functional form is $G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\hbar\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\delta}$, where $i\\delta$ is an infinitesimal imaginary part required for causality.>>>"
