    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the scansion for the line \"et tibi bene esse soli quom sibi sit male\".\n\n**Step 1: Initial Analysis and Elision**\n\n*   First, we identify the words and their basic properties. The line is from Plautus, which means we should expect an iambic senarius (a line of six iambic feet) with common comedic licenses like resolution and iambic shortening.\n*   We must check for elision. The word `bene` ends in `-e` and the following word `esse` begins with `e-`. According to the rules of elision, the final vowel of `bene` is dropped. So, we scan `bene esse` as `ben'esse`.\n*   The total number of syllables after elision is 14: `et`(1) + `ti-bi`(2) + `ben-es-se`(3) + `so-li`(2) + `quom`(1) + `si-bi`(2) + `sit`(1) + `ma-le`(2) = 14 syllables. Since a standard iambic senarius has 12 syllables, we expect two feet to be \"resolved\" (i.e., contain three syllables instead of two).\n\n**Step 2: Determining Syllable Quantities and Feet**\n\nWe will determine the quantity (Long 'L' or Short 'S') of each syllable and group them into six metrical feet. This process often works best by starting from the end of the line, as it is typically more regular.\n\n*   **Foot 6 (the last foot):** `ma-le`\n    *   The vowels in `male` are both short (`mălĕ`). This would be `S S`.\n    *   However, the final syllable of a Latin verse line is treated as long, a rule called *brevis in longo* (\"a short syllable in a long position\").\n    *   Therefore, `mălĕ` scans as `S L`, a perfect iamb.\n    *   **Result: S L**\n\n*   **Foot 5:** `bi sit`\n    *   This foot is formed by the last syllable of `sibi` and the word `sit`. The word `sibi` is split across two feet (caesura).\n    *   The syllable `-bi` is the second syllable of `sĭbĭ`, so it is short (S).\n    *   The word `sit` contains a short vowel, but it is followed by the `m` in `male`. Since it is followed by two consonants (`t` and `m`), it is long by position (L).\n    *   This foot is `S L`, a perfect iamb.\n    *   **Result: S L**\n\n*   **Foot 4:** `quom si-`\n    *   This foot is formed by `quom` and the first syllable of `sibi`.\n    *   In Plautine verse, a final `-m` before a word beginning with a consonant (like `sibi`) often does not make the syllable long. We apply this license and scan `quom` as short (S).\n    *   The syllable `si-` is the first syllable of `sĭbĭ`, so it is short (S).\n    *   The foot is `S S`, a pyrrhic. A pyrrhic is a common resolution for an iamb.\n    *   **Result: S S**\n\n*   **Foot 3:** `so-li`\n    *   The word `soli` (dative of `sōlus`) naturally has two long vowels (`sōlī`), making it a spondee (`L L`).\n    *   However, it follows the syllable `-se` (from `esse`), which is short. A rule in comic poetry called *brevis brevians* (or iambic shortening) allows a short syllable to shorten the following long syllable.\n    *   So, `-se sōlī` (`S L L`) becomes `-se sŏlī` (`S S L`). The word `soli` itself scans as `S L`, an iamb.\n    *   **Result: S L**\n\n*   **Foot 2:** `ben-'es-se`\n    *   The first syllable, `ben-`, is long by position (its short vowel `e` is followed by `n` and `s`).\n    *   The word `esse` (`ĕssĕ`), although technically long-short (`L S`) by position, is frequently treated as two short syllables (`S S`) in Plautus.\n    *   Combining `ben-` (L) and the shortened `esse` (S S) gives us `L S S`, a dactyl. A dactyl is a valid resolution for a spondee in this position.\n    *   **Result: L S S**\n\n*   **Foot 1 (the first foot):** `et ti-bi`\n    *   The syllable `et` is made long by position because its short vowel is followed by two consonants: the `t` of `et` and the `t` of `tibi`. So, `et` is long (L).\n    *   The word `tibi` has two short vowels (`tĭbĭ`), giving two short syllables (S S).\n    *   This foot is `L S S`, a dactyl, which is a valid substitution in the first foot.\n    *   **Result: L S S**\n\n**Final Scansion**\n\nPutting all the feet together, we get the following pattern:\n(Foot 1) (Foot 2) (Foot 3) (Foot 4) (Foot 5) (Foot 6)\nL S S | L S S | S L | S S | S L | S L\n\n<<<L S S L S S S L S S S L S L>>>"
