    "Answering this question requires combining principles of geometry and physics. Let's break down the problem step-by-step.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Icosahedron's Geometry and Orientation:**\n    *   An icosahedron is a regular polyhedron composed of 20 identical equilateral triangular faces, 30 edges, and 12 vertices.\n    *   It possesses a high degree of symmetry. A key property is **central symmetry**, meaning it has a center point, and for any point on the icosahedron, there is an identical point on the opposite side, equidistant from the center.\n    *   The problem states the icosahedron tank is \"standing on one of its faces.\" This means one of its triangular faces is horizontal and serves as the base.\n    *   Due to the icosahedron's symmetry, if it rests on one face, there is another identical face perfectly parallel to it on the opposite side, forming the top of the tank.\n\n2.  **Interpret the \"Half-Filled\" Condition:**\n    *   The term \"half-filled\" refers to the volume. The volume of the water is exactly half the total volume of the icosahedron.\n    *   For any centrally symmetric solid (like an icosahedron, cube, or sphere), a plane passing through its geometric center divides the solid into two parts of equal volume.\n    *   Therefore, when the icosahedron is half-filled, the water level must be precisely at the horizontal plane that passes through the geometric center of the icosahedron.\n\n3.  **Determine the Nature of the Water Surface:**\n    *   Under the influence of gravity, the surface of a stationary liquid in a container forms a flat, horizontal plane.\n    *   Combining this with the conclusion from the previous step, the shape of the water's surface will be the shape of the horizontal cross-section of the icosahedron at its center.\n\n4.  **Find the Shape of the Central Cross-Section:**\n    *   We need to determine the geometric shape that results from slicing the icosahedron with a horizontal plane through its center, given its orientation on a triangular face.\n    *   The orientation on a face means that a 3-fold axis of rotational symmetry is vertical (perpendicular to the base).\n    *   The central cutting plane will intersect the edges of the icosahedron that cross this plane.\n    *   When an icosahedron is oriented on a face, there is a \"belt\" of 6 edges around its equator. The central horizontal plane passes through the midpoint of each of these 6 edges.\n    *   These 6 midpoints form the vertices of the cross-sectional shape.\n    *   The symmetries of the icosahedron dictate the properties of this shape:\n        *   **3-Fold Rotational Symmetry:** Because the cutting plane is perpendicular to a 3-fold rotational axis, the resulting shape must also have 3-fold rotational symmetry (it looks the same after a 120° rotation).\n        *   **Central Symmetry:** Because the cutting plane passes through the center of symmetry of the icosahedron, the resulting shape must also be centrally symmetric (for every vertex, there is an opposite vertex across the center).\n    *   A polygon with 6 vertices that has both 3-fold rotational symmetry and central symmetry must be a **regular hexagon**. The symmetries guarantee all its sides are of equal length and all its internal angles are equal (120°).\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Symmetry is Key:** The solution relies entirely on the high degree of symmetry of the icosahedron.\n*   **Half-Volume = Central Plane:** The connection between being half-filled by volume and the water level being at the central plane is crucial. This is only true for centrally symmetric shapes.\n*   **Orientation Matters:** The fact that the icosahedron stands on a face determines that the central cross-section is perpendicular to a 3-fold axis, leading to a hexagonal shape. If it stood on a vertex, the cross-section would be a regular decagon.\n*   **Water Surface is Planar:** A basic principle of physics is that a liquid's surface at rest is a horizontal plane.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe water in the half-filled tank occupies the bottom half of the icosahedron's volume. The water surface is the horizontal plane passing through the icosahedron's center. The cross-section of an icosahedron at its center, when it is resting on a face, is a regular hexagon.\n\n<<<A regular hexagon>>>"
