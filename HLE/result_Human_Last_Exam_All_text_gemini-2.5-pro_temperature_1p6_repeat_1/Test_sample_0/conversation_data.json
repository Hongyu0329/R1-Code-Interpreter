    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Understand Critical-Level Views\nA critical-level view is a theory in population ethics that evaluates the goodness of a population. Its core idea is that adding a person to the world is only a positive change if that person's welfare (or quality of life) is above a certain positive \"critical level,\" denoted as *c*.\n\n*   If a new person has welfare `u > c`, adding them is a net positive for the world.\n*   If a new person has welfare `u = c`, adding them is neutral.\n*   If a new person has welfare `0 < u < c`, adding them is a net negative for the world, even though their life is worth living for them (since their welfare is positive).\n*   A common way to formalize this is to say the value of a population is the sum of `(u_i - c)` for every person `i` in the population, where `u_i` is their welfare level.\n\n### Step 2: Understand the Conditions of Arrhenius's Theorem\n\nLet's analyze each condition provided in the answer choices. These are simplified versions of the formal conditions but capture their essence.\n\n*   **A. Egalitarian Dominance:** If two populations have the same number of people, and in Population A every person is better off than their counterpart in Population B and the welfare in A is more equally distributed, then A is better than B. This is a condition about comparing same-sized populations.\n*   **B. General Non-Extreme Priority:** There exists a large group of people with very high welfare whose addition would make *any* existing population better. This condition ensures that extremely good lives have significant moral weight.\n*   **C. Non-Elitism:** This condition is designed to avoid certain \"elitist\" conclusions. A standard formulation is: For any two welfare levels `u > v > 0`, there exists some number of people `n` enjoying welfare `u` that constitutes a better population than *any* number of people `m` enjoying the lower welfare `v`. In simpler terms, quality can trump quantity; a sufficiently large population of very happy people is better than any population of less happy (but still happy) people.\n*   **D. Weak Non-Sadism:** Adding people with negative welfare (lives not worth living, i.e., `u < 0`) can never make a population better.\n*   **E. Weak Quality Addition:** For any existing population, it is possible to make it better by adding some number of people who all have positive welfare.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze Which Condition is Violated by Critical-Level Views\n\nLet's test the Critical-Level View (CLV) against each condition.\n\n*   **A. Egalitarian Dominance:** CLVs satisfy this. If Population A has the same size as B, but everyone in A is better off, the sum of `u_i - c` for A will be greater than for B. So, A will be ranked higher.\n*   **B. General Non-Extreme Priority:** CLVs satisfy this. If we add people with a very high welfare level `u >> c`, the term `u - c` will be large and positive. By adding enough of these people, we can make the total value increase, overcoming any initial state.\n*   **D. Weak Non-Sadism:** CLVs satisfy this. If we add a person with negative welfare `u < 0`, the value added is `u - c`. Since `c` is positive, `u - c` is a negative number, making the population's total value decrease.\n*   **E. Weak Quality Addition:** CLVs satisfy this. For any existing population, we can make it better by adding people whose welfare `u` is greater than the critical level `c`. Since `u > c > 0`, these are people with positive welfare. So it is always possible to add people with positive welfare to improve the outcome.\n\n*   **C. Non-Elitism:** Let's test this carefully.\n    *   **The condition states:** For any `u > v > 0`, there is a number `n` (of people at `u`) that is better than *any* number `m` (of people at `v`).\n    *   **Let's use our CLV.** Let the critical level be `c = 10`.\n    *   Choose two welfare levels both *above* the critical level. Let `u = 20` and `v = 15`. Note that `u > v > c > 0`.\n    *   According to the CLV, the value of a population of `n` people at level `u=20` is: `n * (20 - 10) = 10n`.\n    *   The value of a population of `m` people at level `v=15` is: `m * (15 - 10) = 5m`.\n    *   The Non-Elitism condition requires that we can find a fixed `n` such that `10n` is greater than `5m` for *any possible value of m*.\n    *   This is impossible. For any `n` we choose, we can always choose a larger `m`. For instance, if we pick `n=100` (value = 1000), we can just pick `m=300` (value = 1500). The `v`-population is considered better. No matter how large we make `n`, we can always find an `m` that creates a better population according to the CLV.\n    *   Therefore, the Non-Elitism condition is violated. The CLV implies that a sufficiently large quantity of \"good enough\" lives (`v>c`) can always outweigh a smaller quantity of \"excellent\" lives (`u>v>c`), which is exactly what Non-Elitism is meant to rule out.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nCritical-Level Views satisfy most of the desirable conditions but fail on Non-Elitism. This is because they behave like Total Utilitarianism for lives above the critical level, meaning that a large enough quantity of lives with a smaller positive contribution (`v-c`) can always outweigh a smaller quantity of lives with a larger positive contribution (`u-c`).\n\n<<<C>>>"
