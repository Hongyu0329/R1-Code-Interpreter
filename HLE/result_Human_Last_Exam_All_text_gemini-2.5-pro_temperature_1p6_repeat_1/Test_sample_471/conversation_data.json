    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the minimal number of critical points for a smooth function on a 2-torus.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Problem**\n\n*   **Manifold:** We are working on the 2-torus, denoted $T^2$. This is a compact, connected surface without boundary, like the surface of a donut.\n*   **Function:** We have a smooth function $f: T^2 \\to \\mathbb{R}$. \"Smooth\" means the function is infinitely differentiable.\n*   **Critical Point:** A point $p \\in T^2$ is a critical point of $f$ if the derivative of $f$ at $p$ is zero. In local coordinates $(x,y)$, this means $\\nabla f(p) = (\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}(p), \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}(p)) = (0, 0)$.\n*   **Objective:** We want to find the minimum number of critical points that *any* such smooth function must have. This is a global property determined by the topology of the torus.\n\n**2. Basic Argument from Compactness**\n\n*   The torus $T^2$ is a compact space.\n*   By the Extreme Value Theorem, any continuous function on a compact space must attain a global maximum and a global minimum.\n*   For a smooth function, these points of global maximum and minimum must be critical points.\n*   If the function is non-constant, the maximum and minimum values are different, so they are attained at distinct points.\n*   **Conclusion:** Any non-constant smooth function on the torus must have at least **2** critical points. (A constant function has infinitely many critical points, so we are interested in non-constant functions). This gives us a first, simple lower bound.\n\n**3. Using Morse Theory**\n\nMorse theory provides a powerful connection between the topology of a manifold and the critical points of a function on it. We can simplify the problem by considering *Morse functions*—smooth functions whose critical points are all non-degenerate. Any smooth function can be slightly perturbed to become a Morse function.\n\n*   **Morse Inequalities:** For a Morse function $f$ on a compact manifold $M$, the number of critical points of index $k$, denoted $c_k(f)$, is related to the $k$-th Betti number of the manifold, $b_k(M)$, by the following inequalities:\n    1.  $c_k(f) \\ge b_k(M)$ for each $k$.\n    2.  $\\sum_{k=0}^{\\dim(M)} (-1)^k c_k(f) = \\chi(M)$, where $\\chi(M)$ is the Euler characteristic of $M$.\n\n*   **Applying to the Torus ($T^2$):**\n    *   **Dimension:** $\\dim(T^2) = 2$. The possible indices for critical points are $k=0$ (local minima), $k=1$ (saddle points), and $k=2$ (local maxima).\n    *   **Betti Numbers:** The Betti numbers for the torus are:\n        *   $b_0(T^2) = 1$ (it is connected).\n        *   $b_1(T^2) = 2$ (it has two independent non-bounding loops: latitude and longitude).\n        *   $b_2(T^2) = 1$ (it encloses one \"void\").\n    *   **Applying the first inequality:**\n        *   $c_0(\\text{minima}) \\ge b_0 = 1$\n        *   $c_1(\\text{saddles}) \\ge b_1 = 2$\n        *   $c_2(\\text{maxima}) \\ge b_2 = 1$\n    *   **Total number of critical points:** The total number of critical points $C$ for a Morse function must be at least the sum of the Betti numbers:\n        $C = c_0 + c_1 + c_2 \\ge b_0 + b_1 + b_2 = 1 + 2 + 1 = 4$.\n    *   This tells us that any *Morse function* on the torus must have at least **4** critical points.\n\n*   **Checking the Euler Characteristic:**\n    *   The Euler characteristic of the torus is $\\chi(T^2) = b_0 - b_1 + b_2 = 1 - 2 + 1 = 0$.\n    *   The second Morse inequality says $c_0 - c_1 + c_2 = \\chi(T^2) = 0$.\n    *   The minimal numbers suggested by the first inequality ($c_0=1, c_1=2, c_2=1$) satisfy this condition: $1 - 2 + 1 = 0$. This means it is possible for a Morse function to exist that achieves this minimal bound.\n\n**4. Constructing an Example**\n\nTo show that 4 is not just a lower bound but is achievable, we need to construct a function with exactly 4 critical points.\n\n*   Represent the torus as $\\mathbb{R}^2$ with opposite sides of the square $[0, 2\\pi] \\times [0, 2\\pi]$ identified. A function on the torus is then a function $f(x, y)$ that is $2\\pi$-periodic in both $x$ and $y$.\n*   Consider the function $f(x, y) = \\cos(x) + \\cos(y)$.\n*   **Find critical points** (where $\\nabla f = 0$):\n    *   $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = -\\sin(x) = 0 \\implies x = 0, \\pi$.\n    *   $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = -\\sin(y) = 0 \\implies y = 0, \\pi$.\n*   This gives four critical points in the domain $[0, 2\\pi) \\times [0, 2\\pi)$:\n    1.  $(0, 0)$\n    2.  $(0, \\pi)$\n    3.  $(\\pi, 0)$\n    4.  $(\\pi, \\pi)$\n*   **Classify the points** using the Hessian matrix:\n    *   $H(f) = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\cos(x) & 0 \\\\ 0 & -\\cos(y) \\end{pmatrix}$\n    1.  At $(0,0)$: $f=2$, $H = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$. This is a **maximum** (index 2).\n    2.  At $(0,\\pi)$: $f=0$, $H = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$. This is a **saddle point** (index 1).\n    3.  At $(\\pi,0)$: $f=0$, $H = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$. This is a **saddle point** (index 1).\n    4.  At $(\\pi,\\pi)$: $f=-2$, $H = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$. This is a **minimum** (index 0).\n\nThis explicit construction shows that a function with exactly 4 critical points (1 minimum, 2 saddles, 1 maximum) exists.\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n\n*   We established a lower bound of 4 for the number of critical points for any *Morse function*.\n*   We constructed an example of a function that achieves this bound of 4.\n*   A deeper result in differential topology (due to Kuiper, related to the Lusternik–Schnirelmann category) confirms that the minimal number of critical points for *any* smooth function (including those with degenerate critical points) on an orientable surface of genus $g \\ge 1$ is $2g+2$.\n*   For the torus, the genus is $g=1$, so the minimal number is $2(1)+2 = 4$.\n\nThis confirms that it is not possible to find a smooth function on the torus with fewer than 4 critical points.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe minimal number of critical points for a smooth function $f: T^2 \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
