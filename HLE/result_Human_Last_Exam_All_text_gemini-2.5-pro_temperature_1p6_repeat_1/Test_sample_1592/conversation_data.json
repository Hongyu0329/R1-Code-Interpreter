    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the closest province or territory to the Waskaganish gathering place, outside of Quebec.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Location of Waskaganish**\nWaskaganish is a Cree First Nation community located in the Eeyou Istchee James Bay region of northern Quebec. It is situated on the south shore of the Rupert River, at the point where the river flows into Rupert Bay, which is an arm of James Bay. Its approximate geographical coordinates are 51°29′N latitude, 78°46′W longitude.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Potential Neighboring Provinces and Territories**\nThe question asks for the closest province or territory *outside of Quebec*. Based on the location of Waskaganish on James Bay, we need to consider the provinces and territories that border Quebec or are in the vicinity of James Bay.\n*   **Ontario:** This province lies directly to the west and south of Waskaganish. The land border between Quebec and Ontario extends northward until it meets the southern coast of James Bay. The western coast of James Bay is entirely within Ontario.\n*   **Nunavut:** This territory lies to the north of Quebec. Its territory includes all the islands within James Bay and Hudson Bay, such as Akimiski Island and the Belcher Islands.\n*   **Newfoundland and Labrador:** This province borders Quebec to the east, but this border is hundreds of kilometers away from Waskaganish and is not a contender.\n*   **New Brunswick:** This province borders Quebec far to the south and is not a contender.\n\nThe two realistic candidates are **Ontario** and **Nunavut**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Proximity of Ontario**\nThe border between Ontario and Quebec runs north-south. Waskaganish is located in Quebec, relatively close to this provincial border. The closest point of Ontario is the land border that lies to the south and west of Waskaganish. By measuring on a map, the distance from the Waskaganish settlement to the nearest point on the Ontario border is approximately 60-70 kilometers (about 37-43 miles).\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Proximity of Nunavut**\nThe closest part of the territory of Nunavut to Waskaganish is Akimiski Island, the largest island in James Bay. This island is located to the northwest of Waskaganish, separated by a significant stretch of open water. The shortest distance from Waskaganish to the southeastern coast of Akimiski Island is over 150 kilometers (over 93 miles). Other parts of Nunavut are even farther away.\n\n**Step 5: Compare the Distances and Conclude**\nBy comparing the distances calculated in the previous steps:\n*   Distance to the Ontario border: ~60-70 km\n*   Distance to Nunavut (Akimiski Island): >150 km\n\nIt is clear that the land border with the province of Ontario is significantly closer to Waskaganish than any part of the territory of Nunavut.\n\n**Final Conclusion**\nThe closest province or territory to the Waskaganish gathering place, outside of Quebec, is Ontario.\n\n<<<Ontario>>>"
