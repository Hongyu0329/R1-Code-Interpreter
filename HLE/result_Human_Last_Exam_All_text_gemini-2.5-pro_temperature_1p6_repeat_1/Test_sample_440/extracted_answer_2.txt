The density profile \(\rho(z)\) of the gas mixture as a function of height \(z\) (where \(z=0\) is the bottom of the container) is given by:
\(\rho(z) = \rho(0) \exp(-\kappa z)\)
with the following parameters:
\(\rho(0) = 0.020267 \, \text{kg/m}^3\)
\(\kappa = 7.814 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{m}^{-1}\)

So, the explicit function is:
\(\rho(z) = 0.020267 \exp(-7.814 \times 10^{-5} \cdot z)\)
where \(\rho\) is in \(\text{kg/m}^3\) and \(z\) is in meters, valid for \(0 \le z \le 10 \, \text{m}\).
