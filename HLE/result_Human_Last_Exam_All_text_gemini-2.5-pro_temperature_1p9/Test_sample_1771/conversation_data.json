    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the historical linguistic development of the given Proto-Indo-European (PIE) verb.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the Proto-Indo-European (PIE) Form:**\n    *   **Form:** The given PIE form is `*seh₂g-ieti`. This is the 3rd person singular of a present tense verb.\n    *   **Root:** The root is `*seh₂g-`. The laryngeal `*h₂` gives the preceding `*e` vowel an \"a-coloring\". The meaning is related to 'to track, perceive, seek out', as seen in the cognates Hittite *sākizzi* 'gives a sign' and Latin *sāgīre* 'to be keen-nosed, perceive keenly'.\n    *   **Suffix:** The `*-ie-` element marks this as a \"ye/yo-present\" thematic verb. This verb class in PIE generally corresponds to Class I weak verbs in Proto-Germanic.\n\n2.  **Develop the Proto-Germanic (PGmc) Form:**\n    *   We trace the sound changes from PIE `*seh₂g-` to Proto-Germanic.\n    *   **Consonants (Grimm's Law):**\n        *   The initial `*s` remains `*s`.\n        *   The voiced velar stop `*g` undergoes Grimm's Law and becomes its voiceless counterpart, `*k`.\n    *   **Vowel:**\n        *   The PIE sequence `*eh₂` becomes a long vowel `*ā`.\n        *   In Proto-Germanic, PIE `*ā` regularly becomes `*ō`.\n    *   **Reconstructed PGmc Root:** Combining these changes, the PIE root `*seh₂g-` gives the PGmc root `*sōk-`.\n    *   **Reconstructed PGmc Verb:** Since the PIE verb is a *ye/yo-present, its reflex in Proto-Germanic is a Class I weak verb. These verbs are formed with the suffix `*-ja-`. The standard citation form for a verb is the infinitive, which in PGmc ends in `*-aną`. Therefore, the PGmc infinitive is **`*sōkijaną`**.\n\n3.  **Develop the Old Norse (ON) Form:**\n    *   We start from the PGmc infinitive `*sōkijaną`.\n    *   **Vowel Change (i-umlaut):** The `*j` in the suffix `*-ija-` causes i-umlaut (or i-mutation) on the preceding root vowel. The PGmc long vowel `*ō` is fronted to `*ǿ` (later written as `œ` or `æ` in Old Norse).\n    *   **Ending:** The PGmc infinitive ending `*-aną` is reduced to `-a` in Old Norse. The `*j` is retained.\n    *   **Result:** PGmc `*sōkijaną` becomes ON **`sœkja`** (or `sækja`).\n\n4.  **Develop the Old English (OE) Form:**\n    *   We start from the PGmc infinitive `*sōkijaną`.\n    *   **Vowel Change (i-umlaut):** Similar to Old Norse, the `*j` causes i-umlaut on the root vowel `*ō`. In Old English, `*ō` umlauts to `*ē`.\n    *   **Consonant Change (Palatalization):** The PGmc velar `*k` is followed by the front glide `*j`. This environment causes the `*k` to palatalize, becoming the affricate `*ċ` (pronounced /tʃ/, like \"ch\" in \"church\"). The `*j` is then absorbed or deleted.\n    *   **Ending:** The PGmc infinitive ending `*-aną` becomes `-an` in Old English.\n    *   **Result:** PGmc `*sōkijaną` becomes OE **`sēcan`**.\n\n5.  **Develop the Old High German (OHG) Form:**\n    *   We start from the PGmc infinitive `*sōkijaną`.\n    *   **Vowel Change:** The PGmc long vowel `*ō` diphthongizes to `*uo` in Old High German. This is a regular sound change (e.g., PGmc `*fōts` > OHG `fuoz` 'foot').\n    *   **Consonant Change (High German Consonant Shift):** The PGmc voiceless stop `*k` undergoes the Second Sound Shift. After a vowel, `*k` becomes the voiceless fricative `*hh` (pronounced /x/, like the \"ch\" in Scottish \"loch\").\n    *   **Suffix/Umlaut:** In Old High German Class I weak verbs with a long root syllable (like `*sōk-`), the medial `*j` was lost early, *before* it could trigger i-umlaut on the `uo` diphthong in the infinitive.\n    *   **Ending:** The infinitive ending `*-aną` becomes `-an` or `-en` in OHG.\n    *   **Result:** PGmc `*sōkijaną` becomes OHG **`suohhen`** (alternative spelling `suochen`).\n\n### Careful Points to Note:\n\n*   **Vowel Correspondence:** Correctly identifying that PIE `*eh₂` becomes PGmc `*ō` is crucial.\n*   **Verb Class Correspondence:** Recognizing that a PIE `*ye/yo-`present becomes a PGmc Class I weak verb (`*-janą`) is key to predicting the phonological environment for later changes.\n*   **Grimm's Law vs. Verner's Law:** Grimm's Law correctly applies to `*g` > `*k`. Verner's Law is not applicable here as it affects PIE voiceless stops/fricatives in unstressed environments, not voiced stops.\n*   **Language-Specific Changes:** Each daughter language has its own distinct developments:\n    *   **i-umlaut** affects the root vowel differently in ON (`ō` > `œ`) and OE (`ō` > `ē`), and not at all in the OHG infinitive form.\n    *   **Consonant shifts** are critical: Palatalization in OE (`*k` > `*ċ`) and the High German Consonant Shift in OHG (`*k` > `*hh`) produce very different results from the same source.\n\n### Final Answer Derivations:\n\n*   **Proto-Germanic:** *sōkijaną\n*   **Old Norse:** sœkja\n*   **Old English:** sēcan\n*   **Old High German:** suohhen\n\n<<<Proto-Germanic: *sōkijaną; Old Norse: sœkja; Old English: sēcan; Old High German: suohhen>>>"
