    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the possible degrees of normal field extensions.\n\n**Step 1: Factor the polynomial**\nLet $f(x) = x^7 - 2 x^5 - 9 x^3 + 3 x^2 + 18 x - 6$. We look for a factorization of this polynomial over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nWe can try to rearrange and group terms:\n$f(x) = (x^7 - 2x^5) - (9x^3 - 18x) + (3x^2 - 6)$\n$f(x) = x^5(x^2 - 2) - 9x(x^2 - 2) + 3(x^2 - 2)$\n$f(x) = (x^5 - 9x + 3)(x^2 - 2)$\n\nSo the polynomial $f(x)$ factors into two polynomials over $\\mathbb{Q}$: $g(x) = x^2 - 2$ and $h(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$.\nThe splitting field $K$ of $f(x)$ is the smallest field containing the roots of both $g(x)$ and $h(x)$. This is the compositum of the splitting fields of $g(x)$ and $h(x)$.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the factors and their Galois groups**\n\n*   **For $g(x) = x^2 - 2$:**\n    This polynomial is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$ by Eisenstein's criterion with prime $p=2$. Its roots are $\\pm\\sqrt{2}$. The splitting field is $K_g = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n    The extension $K_g/\\mathbb{Q}$ is normal and has degree $[\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}):\\mathbb{Q}] = 2$.\n    The Galois group is $\\text{Gal}(K_g/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n*   **For $h(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$:**\n    This polynomial is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$ by Eisenstein's criterion with prime $p=3$.\n    To determine its Galois group, we analyze its roots. The derivative is $h'(x) = 5x^4 - 9$. The critical points are $x = \\pm \\sqrt[4]{9/5}$.\n    Let's evaluate $h(x)$ at these points:\n    $h(\\sqrt[4]{9/5}) = (9/5)\\sqrt[4]{9/5} - 9\\sqrt[4]{9/5} + 3 = (-36/5)\\sqrt[4]{9/5} + 3$. Since $1 < \\sqrt[4]{9/5} < 2$, we have $(-36/5)\\sqrt[4]{9/5} < -7.2$, so $h(\\sqrt[4]{9/5}) < 0$. This is a local minimum.\n    $h(-\\sqrt[4]{9/5}) = (36/5)\\sqrt[4]{9/5} + 3 > 0$. This is a local maximum.\n    Since the local maximum is positive and the local minimum is negative, $h(x)$ must have exactly three real roots. The other two roots form a complex conjugate pair.\n    A theorem in Galois theory states that if an irreducible polynomial of prime degree $p$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ has exactly two non-real roots, its Galois group is the symmetric group $S_p$.\n    Here, $p=5$ is prime, so the Galois group of $h(x)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is $S_5$.\n    Let $K_h$ be the splitting field of $h(x)$. $K_h/\\mathbb{Q}$ is a normal extension with $[K_h:\\mathbb{Q}] = |S_5| = 120$.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Galois group of K**\n\nThe splitting field $K$ is the compositum $K_g K_h = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}) K_h$. The degree of this extension is $[K:\\mathbb{Q}] = [K_g:\\mathbb{Q}][K_h:\\mathbb{Q}]/[K_g \\cap K_h:\\mathbb{Q}]$.\nWe need to determine the intersection $K_g \\cap K_h = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}) \\cap K_h$.\nThe intermediate fields of $K_h/\\mathbb{Q}$ correspond to subgroups of $\\text{Gal}(K_h/\\mathbb{Q})=S_5$. Any quadratic subfield corresponds to a subgroup of index 2. The only subgroup of index 2 in $S_5$ is the alternating group $A_5$. Thus, $K_h$ has a unique quadratic subfield.\nThis unique quadratic subfield is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{D})$, where $D$ is the discriminant of $h(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$. The discriminant of $x^n+ax+b$ is $D = (-1)^{n(n-1)/2}[n^n b^{n-1} + (-1)^{n-1}(n-1)^{n-1}a^n]$.\nFor $n=5, a=-9, b=3$, $D = 3125 \\cdot 3^4 + 256 \\cdot (-9)^5 = 253125 - 15116544 < 0$.\nSo the quadratic subfield of $K_h$ is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{D})$, which is an imaginary quadratic field.\nSince $K_g=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ is a real field, $K_g \\neq \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{D})$.\nTherefore, the intersection is trivial: $K_g \\cap K_h = \\mathbb{Q}$.\nSince $K_g/\\mathbb{Q}$ and $K_h/\\mathbb{Q}$ are both normal extensions with trivial intersection, the Galois group of the compositum $K = K_g K_h$ is the direct product of their Galois groups.\n$G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong \\text{Gal}(K_g/\\mathbb{Q}) \\times \\text{Gal}(K_h/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times S_5$.\nThe degree of the extension is $[K:\\mathbb{Q}] = |\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times S_5| = 2 \\cdot 120 = 240$.\n\n**Step 4: Find the possible degrees of normal intermediate fields**\n\nWe are looking for the possible degrees of field extensions $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ such that $\\mathbb{Q} \\subsetneq L \\subsetneq K$ and $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is a normal extension.\nBy the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory, these fields $L$ are in one-to-one correspondence with the normal subgroups $N$ of $G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$, where $N = \\text{Gal}(K/L)$.\nThe condition $\\mathbb{Q} \\subsetneq L \\subsetneq K$ means that the corresponding normal subgroup $N$ must be a proper non-trivial subgroup, i.e., $N \\neq G$ and $N \\neq \\{e\\}$.\nThe degree of the extension is given by $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = [G:N] = |G|/|N|$.\nWe need to find all proper non-trivial normal subgroups of $G = \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times S_5$ and calculate their indices.\n\nThe normal subgroups of $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$ are $\\{e\\}$ and $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$.\nThe normal subgroups of $S_5$ are $\\{e\\}$, $A_5$, and $S_5$.\n\nNormal subgroups of $G$ include:\n1.  **Product-type subgroups**: $H \\times K$, where $H \\unlhd \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$ and $K \\unlhd S_5$.\n    *   $N_1 = \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\{e\\}$: $|N_1|=2$. Index $[G:N_1] = 240/2=120$.\n    *   $N_2 = \\{e\\} \\times S_5$: $|N_2|=120$. Index $[G:N_2] = 240/120=2$.\n    *   $N_3 = \\{e\\} \\times A_5$: $|N_3|=60$. Index $[G:N_3] = 240/60=4$.\n    *   $N_4 = \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times A_5$: $|N_4|=2 \\cdot 60=120$. Index $[G:N_4] = 240/120=2$.\n\n2.  **Diagonal-type subgroups**: These arise from isomorphisms between quotient groups of normal subgroups of the factors. The only non-trivial possibility here is an isomorphism $\\phi: (\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})/\\{e\\} \\to S_5/A_5$, since both quotients are isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$.\n    Let the non-identity element of $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$ be denoted by $-1$ and the identity by $1$. The elements of $S_5/A_5$ can be represented by $\\text{sgn}(\\sigma) \\in \\{1, -1\\}$. The isomorphism maps $z \\in \\{1, -1\\}$ to its value. The resulting normal subgroup is:\n    $N_5 = \\{(z, \\sigma) \\in \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times S_5 \\mid \\text{sgn}(\\sigma) = z \\}$.\n    This consists of pairs $(1, \\sigma)$ where $\\sigma$ is an even permutation, and $(-1, \\sigma)$ where $\\sigma$ is an odd permutation.\n    $|N_5| = |A_5| + |S_5 \\setminus A_5| = 60 + 60 = 120$.\n    The index is $[G:N_5] = 240/120 = 2$.\n\nThese are all the proper non-trivial normal subgroups of $G$. The degrees of the corresponding normal subfields $L$ are the indices we calculated:\n*   Index 120 (from $N_1$)\n*   Index 2 (from $N_2, N_4, N_5$)\n*   Index 4 (from $N_3$)\n\nThe set of all possible distinct degrees for such field extensions $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is $\\{2, 4, 120\\}$."
