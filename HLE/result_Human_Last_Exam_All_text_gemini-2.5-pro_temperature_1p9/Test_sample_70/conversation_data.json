    "This problem requires us to determine which African national flags have a linear algebraic rank of 2, the same as the flag of Denmark, under the assumption that the rank is maximized.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Flag of Denmark and Determine its Rank\n\n1.  **Describe the flag of Denmark:** The flag of Denmark features a red field with a white Nordic cross. The cross is composed of a horizontal and a vertical stripe.\n2.  **Represent the flag as a matrix:** To analyze its rank, we can imagine the flag as a grid of pixels, forming a matrix. Each color corresponds to a numerical value. The instruction \"assume that values in each matrix are chosen so that the rank of each flag is maximal\" means we should choose distinct, non-zero values for each color (e.g., Red=1, White=2) that do not create any incidental linear dependencies.\n3.  **Identify the types of rows (or columns):** In a matrix representation of the Danish flag, there are only two distinct types of rows:\n    *   Rows that are entirely part of the horizontal white stripe: These rows will consist of only the value for White (e.g., `[2, 2, 2, 2, 2]`).\n    *   Rows that cross the vertical part of the cross: These rows will consist of the value for Red in the field sections and the value for White in the cross section (e.g., `[1, 1, 2, 1, 1]`).\n4.  **Calculate the rank:** Let the two row types be `v1 = [2, 2, 2, 2, 2]` and `v2 = [1, 1, 2, 1, 1]`. These two vectors are linearly independent because one cannot be expressed as a scalar multiple of the other (`v2 = k * v1` would imply `1 = 2k` and `2 = 2k`, which is impossible). Since all rows in the flag's matrix are of one of these two types, the entire row space is spanned by these two vectors. Therefore, the maximal rank of the flag of Denmark is 2.\n\n### Step 2: Establish Criteria for a Flag to Have Rank 2\n\nA flag will have a maximal rank of 2 if its structure can be described by exactly two linearly independent row (or column) vectors. This excludes:\n*   **Rank 1 Flags:** Flags with very simple patterns, where all rows (or columns) are scalar multiples of a single vector. This includes flags with only horizontal or vertical solid-colored stripes (e.g., Nigeria, Botswana). For example, in a horizontal tricolor, the rows are `[c1, c1, ..., c1]`, `[c2, c2, ..., c2]`, and `[c3, c3, ..., c3]`, which are all multiples of `[1, 1, ..., 1]`, making the rank 1.\n*   **Rank > 2 Flags:** Flags with complex patterns that generate three or more linearly independent row/column vectors. This often occurs with:\n    *   Diagonal stripes (e.g., Congo-Brazzaville).\n    *   Complex emblems with multiple colors or intricate shapes spanning different background colors (e.g., Kenya, Somalia).\n    *   Triangles or chevrons at the hoist combined with stripes (e.g., Djibouti, Mozambique).\n\nFlags with a maximal rank of 2 typically fall into one of these categories:\n1.  **Stripe-based flags with a simple emblem:** A flag with horizontal or vertical stripes (a rank-1 base) that includes a simple emblem. If the emblem is confined to a single stripe or straddles a boundary in a simple, vertically/horizontally consistent way, it introduces just one additional linearly independent vector pattern.\n2.  **Flags with a simple 2x2 block structure:** Flags that can be partitioned into blocks creating two types of rows. For instance, a flag with a vertical bar on the left and two horizontal bars on the right (e.g., Benin).\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Flags of African Nations\n\nWe now apply these criteria to the flags of African nations.\n\n**Flags with Rank 2:**\n\n*   **Benin / Madagascar:** These flags consist of a vertical stripe at the hoist and two horizontal stripes adjacent to it. This creates two row patterns: `[Color A, Color B]` and `[Color A, Color C]`. These two row types are linearly independent, so the rank is 2.\n*   **Flags with Stripes and a Simple Emblem on One Stripe (or a simple boundary):** This is a large category. The stripe pattern provides a rank-1 base (all rows/columns are multiples of `[1,1,...1]`). A simple emblem adds a second linearly independent vector pattern.\n    *   **Burkina Faso:** Horizontal bicolour with a star straddling the central boundary. This creates two new row types (`[Red...Star...Red]` and `[Green...Star...Green]`), but they can be formed from a basis of two vectors. Rank 2.\n    *   **Cameroon / Senegal:** Vertical tricolors with a star in the central stripe. The columns are of two types: solid color, or central stripe color with a star color. Rank 2.\n    *   **Egypt / Ghana / Lesotho / Libya / Malawi / Niger / Rwanda:** Horizontal tricolors with a simple emblem (eagle, star, hat, crescent, sun, disc) located on one of the stripes. This creates one new row pattern in addition to the solid-color rows. Rank 2.\n    *   **Eswatini (Swaziland):** Horizontal stripes with a central shield. The shield's colors are vertically aligned and cross the central red stripe and its yellow fimbriations. This \"disturbance\" is confined to the same components in the column vectors, adding only one dimension to the rank. Rank 2.\n    *   **Mauritania:** A green field (with a crescent/star emblem) is now bounded by red stripes top and bottom. The row patterns are: `[Red...Red]`, `[Green...Green]`, and `[Green...Emblem...Green]`. These can all be generated from a basis of two vectors. Rank 2.\n\n**Flags with Other Ranks (for comparison):**\n\n*   **Rank 1:** Botswana, Gabon, Nigeria, CÃ´te d'Ivoire (flags with only solid vertical or horizontal stripes).\n*   **Rank > 2:** Algeria (emblem crosses boundary complexly), Kenya (emblem crosses multiple stripes), Somalia (star emblem shape creates multiple distinct row patterns), Congo-Brazzaville (diagonal stripes), Djibouti (hoist triangle).\n\n### Final List of Nations\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the following African nations have flags with a maximal linear algebraic rank of 2, same as the flag of Denmark:\n\nBenin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Egypt, Eswatini, Ghana, Lesotho, Libya, Madagascar, Malawi, Mauritania, Niger, Rwanda, and Senegal.\n\n<<<Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Egypt, Eswatini, Ghana, Lesotho, Libya, Madagascar, Malawi, Mauritania, Niger, Rwanda, Senegal>>>"
