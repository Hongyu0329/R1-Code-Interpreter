    "This is a brain-teaser that uses a haiku to hide clues. Here is a step-by-step analysis to arrive at the solution.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\nThe request asks to solve a riddle presented as a haiku with a title. The title, \"The Bays\", is described as being the question. The final answer needs to be presented \"in alphabetical order\". This implies that we must first find the answer, which is likely a word, and then rearrange its letters alphabetically for the final output.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Haiku Structure**\nThe haiku has three lines, following the 5-7-5 syllable structure:\n*   \"An Au-gust tem-pest\" (5 syllables)\n*   \"Twice fif-teen brings winds of change\" (7 syllables)\n*   \"A di-vine one yields\" (5 syllables)\n\nGiven the three-line structure, it is highly probable that each line provides a clue to a single letter, and together these three letters form the answer word.\n\n**Step 3: Decipher Each Line of the Haiku**\n\n*   **Line 1: \"An August tempest\"**\n    *   This phrase describes a powerful, seasonal storm. August is a month in the peak season for these storms in many parts of the world.\n    *   A common and fitting term for such a large-scale, rotating storm is a **C**yclone.\n    *   Thus, the first letter is **C**.\n\n*   **Line 2: \"Twice fifteen brings winds of change\"**\n    *   \"Twice fifteen\" is a clear numerical clue: 2 x 15 = 30.\n    *   \"brings winds of change\" points towards a major historical event or upheaval.\n    *   In history, the number 30 is famously linked to the \"Thirty Tyrants,\" a pro-Spartan oligarchy that ruled **A**thens after the Peloponnesian War. Their rule represented a dramatic \"wind of change\" for the Athenian democracy.\n    *   The key here is the city they ruled: **A**thens.\n    *   Thus, the second letter is **A**.\n\n*   **Line 3: \"A divine one yields\"**\n    *   This line is a meta-riddle, a clue about the alphabet itself.\n    *   \"A\" refers to the first letter of the alphabet. It can be poetically described as the \"divine one\" or the primary one.\n    *   \"yields\" means to give way to or be followed by.\n    *   In the sequence of the alphabet, the letter 'A' \"yields\" to the letter that follows it, which is 'B'.\n    *   Thus, the third letter is **B**.\n\n**Step 4: Form the Answer and Apply the Final Instruction**\n\n*   Combining the letters from each line in order gives us **C - A - B**.\n*   This spells the word **CAB**.\n*   The problem states: \"in alphabetical order what is the answer?\". This is an instruction to take the letters of the answer word (C, A, B) and arrange them in alphabetical order.\n*   Sorting these letters alphabetically, we get **A, B, C**.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is the alphabetized string of letters.\n\n<<<ABC>>>"
