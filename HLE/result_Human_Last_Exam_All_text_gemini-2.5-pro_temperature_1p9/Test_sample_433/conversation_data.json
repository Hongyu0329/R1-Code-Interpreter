    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question regarding the Beyond-Use Date (BUD) for a single-dose ampule.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Subject:** The question asks for the Beyond-Use Date (BUD) of a specific type of container—a single-dose ampule—under specific conditions.\n\n2.  **Define Key Terms:**\n    *   **BUD (Beyond-Use Date):** The date or time after which a preparation should not be used. It is determined by the potential for microbial contamination, chemical degradation, or physical changes.\n    *   **Single-Dose Container:** A container of a sterile medication intended for parenteral administration (injection or infusion) that is meant for use in a single patient for a single procedure. It typically does not contain an antimicrobial preservative.\n    *   **Ampule:** A sealed glass container with a neck that is designed to be broken open. Once opened, it cannot be resealed. It becomes an \"open system\" immediately exposed to the surrounding environment.\n    *   **Sterile Environment:** This refers to an ISO Class 5 Primary Engineering Control (PEC), such as a laminar airflow workbench (LAFW) or a biological safety cabinet (BSC), which provides highly filtered, clean air to minimize contamination.\n\n3.  **Consult Governing Standards:** The primary source for these regulations in the United States is the United States Pharmacopeia (USP) General Chapter <797>, \"Pharmaceutical Compounding—Sterile Preparations.\"\n\n4.  **Apply the Standard to the Specific Container:** USP <797> has very specific rules for different container types. The most critical factor for an ampule is its physical nature. Unlike a vial with a rubber stopper that can be punctured and reseals itself, an ampule is broken open and remains completely open to the air. This presents a very high risk of contamination.\n\n5.  **Determine the BUD:** Because an opened ampule is an open system and cannot be protected from airborne contamination, USP <797> and best practices dictate that its contents must be used **immediately**. There is no provision for storing the contents of an opened ampule, even if it was opened in the cleanest environment (ISO Class 5). Any unused portion of the medication must be discarded right away.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Ampule vs. Vial:** It is crucial not to confuse an ampule with a single-dose *vial*. According to the latest USP <797> guidelines, a single-dose vial that has been punctured in an ISO Class 5 environment can be used for up to **12 hours**. This is because the vial's rubber stopper provides a significant barrier to contamination compared to the completely open neck of an ampule.\n*   **The Meaning of \"Immediately\":** In a pharmacy or clinical context, \"immediately\" means the contents should be withdrawn and administered or used in a compounding procedure without any storage or delay.\n*   **The Role of the Sterile Environment:** Opening the ampule in a sterile environment minimizes the contamination risk *at the moment of opening*, but it does not protect the open container from contamination over time. Therefore, the \"immediate use\" rule still applies.\n*   **No Preservatives:** Single-dose containers, by definition, usually lack antimicrobial preservatives. This means that if any microbes are introduced, they can grow freely, making prompt use essential.\n\n### Final Answer Acquisition\n\nBased on the analysis of pharmacy standards and the inherent risk associated with an open-system container like an ampule, the conclusion is firm. The Beyond-Use Date (BUD) is not a specified number of hours but a directive for immediate action.\n\n<<<The contents must be used immediately after opening. There is no storage time permitted for an opened ampule, and any unused portion must be discarded right away.>>>"
