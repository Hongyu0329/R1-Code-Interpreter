    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Find the equilibrium points of the differential equation.**\nThe given differential equation is:\n$$x'(t) = -x^{3}(t) + 2x^{2}(t) - x(t)$$\nEquilibrium points (or fixed points) are the constant solutions of the ODE, which occur where $x'(t) = 0$. Let $f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 - x$. We need to solve the equation $f(x) = 0$.\n\n$$ -x^3 + 2x^2 - x = 0 $$\nWe can factor out $-x$ from the expression:\n$$ -x(x^2 - 2x + 1) = 0 $$\nThe term in the parenthesis is a perfect square, $(x-1)^2$. So the equation becomes:\n$$ -x(x-1)^2 = 0 $$\nThe solutions to this equation are $x=0$ and $x=1$. These are the two equilibrium points of the system.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the stability of each equilibrium point.**\nTo determine the stability of an equilibrium point $x^*$, we can analyze the sign of the derivative of the right-hand side, $f'(x^*)$, or analyze the sign of $f(x)$ in the neighborhood of $x^*$.\n\nAn equilibrium point $x^*$ is **stable** if solutions that start near $x^*$ stay near $x^*$ and tend towards it as $t \\to \\infty$. This happens if $f(x)$ is positive to the left of $x^*$ and negative to the right of $x^*$. A sufficient condition for stability is $f'(x^*) < 0$.\nAn equilibrium point is **unstable** if solutions that start near $x^*$ move away from it.\nAn equilibrium point is **semi-stable** if solutions on one side of $x^*$ move towards it, while on the other side they move away. A semi-stable equilibrium point is not considered stable.\n\nLet's use the linearization method first. We calculate the derivative of $f(x)$:\n$$ f'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(-x^3 + 2x^2 - x) = -3x^2 + 4x - 1 $$\n\nNow we evaluate $f'(x)$ at each equilibrium point:\n*   **For the equilibrium point $x = 0$:**\n    $$ f'(0) = -3(0)^2 + 4(0) - 1 = -1 $$\n    Since $f'(0) < 0$, the equilibrium point $x=0$ is **stable**.\n\n*   **For the equilibrium point $x = 1$:**\n    $$ f'(1) = -3(1)^2 + 4(1) - 1 = -3 + 4 - 1 = 0 $$\n    Since $f'(1) = 0$, the first derivative test is inconclusive. We need to use another method, like a phase line analysis.\n\n**Step 3: Perform a phase line analysis for the point $x=1$.**\nWe need to check the sign of $f(x) = -x(x-1)^2$ on either side of $x=1$.\n\n*   **For $x$ slightly less than 1 (e.g., $x \\in (0, 1)$):**\n    Let's pick $x=0.5$.\n    $f(0.5) = -0.5(0.5-1)^2 = -0.5(-0.5)^2 = -0.5(0.25) = -0.125$.\n    Since $f(x) < 0$, $x'(t) < 0$, so the solution $x(t)$ decreases, moving away from $x=1$.\n\n*   **For $x$ slightly greater than 1 (e.g., $x > 1$):**\n    Let's pick $x=2$.\n    $f(2) = -2(2-1)^2 = -2(1)^2 = -2$.\n    Since $f(x) < 0$, $x'(t) < 0$, so the solution $x(t)$ decreases, moving towards $x=1$.\n\nThe behavior of the solutions around $x=1$ can be visualized on a phase line as: `... ←←← 1 ←←← ...`.\nSince solutions to the left of $x=1$ move away from it, the point is not stable. This type of equilibrium is called **semi-stable**. Semi-stable equilibria are considered a type of unstable equilibrium.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the number of stable equilibrium points, m.**\nBased on the analysis above:\n*   $x=0$ is a stable equilibrium point.\n*   $x=1$ is a semi-stable (and therefore, not stable) equilibrium point.\n\nSo, the total number of stable equilibrium points is one.\n$$ m = 1 $$\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the final expression.**\nThe question asks for the value of $m - 2^{4048}$.\nSubstituting $m=1$ into the expression, we get:\n$$ 1 - 2^{4048} $$\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   Correctly factoring the polynomial to find all equilibrium points. The factorization $-x(x-1)^2 = 0$ yielding $x=0$ and $x=1$ is correct.\n*   Understanding the definition of stability. A key point is that a \"stable\" equilibrium must attract solutions from both sides. A semi-stable point, which attracts from one side and repels from the other (or has flow towards it from one side and flow away on the other, as is the case here on the left side), is not classified as stable.\n*   Correctly handling the case where the first derivative test is inconclusive ($f'(x^*)=0$) by examining the sign of $f(x)$ around the equilibrium point.\n*   The calculation itself is straightforward once $m$ is determined.\n\nFinal computation:\n$m=1$.\nWe need to find $m - 2^{4048} = 1 - 2^{4048}$.\n\n<<<$1 - 2^{4048}$>>>"
