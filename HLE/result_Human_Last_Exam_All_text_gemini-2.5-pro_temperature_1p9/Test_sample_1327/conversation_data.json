    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the number sequence puzzle.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the sequence and look for a primary pattern.**\nThe given sequence is: 2, 11, 23, 51, 119, ( )\nLet's examine the relationship between consecutive terms. We can try to see if the next term can be derived from the previous one by multiplication and addition/subtraction.\nLet the sequence be denoted by A(n).\n*   A(2) = 11. How can we get 11 from A(1) = 2?\n    *   2 * 2 = 4. 11 - 4 = 7. So, A(2) = 2 * A(1) + 7.\n*   A(3) = 23. How can we get 23 from A(2) = 11?\n    *   2 * 11 = 22. 23 - 22 = 1. So, A(3) = 2 * A(2) + 1.\n*   A(4) = 51. How can we get 51 from A(3) = 23?\n    *   2 * 23 = 46. 51 - 46 = 5. So, A(4) = 2 * A(3) + 5.\n*   A(5) = 119. How can we get 119 from A(4) = 51?\n    *   2 * 51 = 102. 119 - 102 = 17. So, A(5) = 2 * A(4) + 17.\n\n**Careful Point:** The pattern seems to be `A(n) = 2 * A(n-1) + C(n)`, where C(n) is another sequence. This type of multi-layered pattern is common in complex sequence problems. The first relationship (getting 11 from 2) seems to not fit the pattern that emerges from the third term onwards. In many sequence puzzles, the pattern solidifies after the first couple of terms, which act as initial \"seed\" values.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the secondary sequence.**\nFrom our analysis in Step 1, starting from the third term, we have the rule `A(n) = 2 * A(n-1) + (a new number)`. The sequence of these \"new numbers\" is {1, 5, 17, ...}. Let's call this sequence C.\n*   C = {1, 5, 17, ...}\nNow, we need to find the pattern within sequence C to predict its next term.\n*   How to get 5 from 1?\n    *   1 * 3 + 2 = 5\n*   How to get 17 from 5?\n    *   5 * 3 + 2 = 17\n\n**Careful Point:** We have found a simple and consistent pattern for sequence C: each term is 3 times the previous term plus 2. `C(k) = 3 * C(k-1) + 2`.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the next term of the secondary sequence C.**\nUsing the pattern `C(k) = 3 * C(k-1) + 2`, the next term in C after 17 will be:\n*   Next C term = 3 * 17 + 2 = 51 + 2 = 53.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the next term of the main sequence A.**\nWe now have the number that needs to be added. The next term in the main sequence, A(6), will be calculated using the pattern from Step 1 with the new C term from Step 3.\n*   A(6) = 2 * A(5) + (next C term)\n*   A(6) = 2 * 119 + 53\n*   A(6) = 238 + 53\n*   A(6) = 291\n\nThe number that should be filled in the parentheses is 291.\n\n**Final Answer Summary:**\n1.  The sequence is 2, 11, 23, 51, 119.\n2.  The relationship between terms is `A(n) = 2 * A(n-1) + C(n-2)`.\n3.  The terms added are `1, 5, 17, ...`\n4.  This secondary sequence follows the rule `C(k) = 3 * C(k-1) + 2`.\n5.  The next term in the secondary sequence is `3 * 17 + 2 = 53`.\n6.  The next term in the main sequence is `2 * 119 + 53 = 291`.\n\n<<<A>>>"
