    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the smallest number $n$ such that there exists a set $G$ of $n$ elements with a binary operation that is not a group.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the definition of a group.**\nA group is a set $G$ together with a binary operation $\\cdot$ that satisfies four axioms:\n1.  **Closure:** For any two elements $a, b \\in G$, the result $a \\cdot b$ is also in $G$. The problem statement ensures this by saying $\\cdot$ is a \"binary operation defined on it\".\n2.  **Associativity:** For all $a, b, c \\in G$, the equation $(a \\cdot b) \\cdot c = a \\cdot (b \\cdot c)$ holds.\n3.  **Identity Element:** There exists an element $e \\in G$ such that for every element $a \\in G$, the equation $e \\cdot a = a \\cdot e = a$ holds.\n4.  **Inverse Element:** For each element $a \\in G$, there exists an element $b \\in G$ (the inverse of $a$, denoted $a^{-1}$) such that $a \\cdot b = b \\cdot a = e$, where $e$ is the identity element.\n\nTo not be a group, the structure $(G, \\cdot)$ must fail at least one of the last three axioms (associativity, identity, or inverse).\n\n**Step 2: Consider the possible sizes of the set G, starting from the smallest possible values for n.**\nThe question asks for the \"smallest number n\". This could technically include $n=0$.\n\n*   **Case n = 0:** The set $G$ is the empty set, $G = \\{\\}$. A binary operation on $G$ is a function from $G \\times G$ to $G$. Since $G \\times G$ is empty, there is exactly one such function (the empty function).\n    *   **Associativity:** The condition $\\forall a,b,c \\in G, (a \\cdot b) \\cdot c = a \\cdot (b \\cdot c)$ is vacuously true, because there are no elements in $G$.\n    *   **Identity Element:** The condition $\\exists e \\in G, \\dots$ is false, because there is no element $e$ in the empty set.\n    *   Since the identity axiom fails, the empty set with its binary operation is not a group.\n\n    **Careful Point:** In standard mathematics, particularly in abstract algebra, a group is defined to be a *non-empty* set. The axiom for the identity element (\"There exists an element e in G...\") explicitly implies that the set cannot be empty. Therefore, under the standard definition of a group, $n$ must be at least 1. We will proceed with this standard convention.\n\n*   **Case n = 1:** Let $G$ be a set with one element, say $G = \\{a\\}$.\n    *   There is only one possible binary operation we can define on $G$. Since the result of the operation must be in $G$, we must have $a \\cdot a = a$.\n    *   Let's check the group axioms for $(G, \\cdot)$:\n        1.  **Closure:** $a \\cdot a = a \\in G$. This holds.\n        2.  **Associativity:** We need to check if $(x \\cdot y) \\cdot z = x \\cdot (y \\cdot z)$ for all $x, y, z \\in G$. The only choice is $x=y=z=a$. This gives $(a \\cdot a) \\cdot a = a \\cdot (a \\cdot a)$, which simplifies to $a \\cdot a = a \\cdot a$. This is true.\n        3.  **Identity Element:** Let's test if $a$ is the identity element. We need $a \\cdot x = x \\cdot a = x$ for all $x \\in G$. The only choice is $x=a$. $a \\cdot a = a$, so this holds. The element $a$ is the identity element.\n        4.  **Inverse Element:** For each element, we need an inverse. The only element is $a$. Its inverse must satisfy $a \\cdot x = e$, where $e=a$. So we need $a \\cdot x = a$. Setting $x=a$ gives $a \\cdot a = a$, which is true. So the inverse of $a$ is $a$ itself.\n    *   Since all four axioms hold, any set of size 1 with a binary operation must be a group (this is called the trivial group). Therefore, $n$ cannot be 1.\n\n*   **Case n = 2:** Let $G$ be a set with two elements, say $G = \\{a, b\\}$. We need to determine if it's possible to define a binary operation $\\cdot$ on $G$ such that $(G, \\cdot)$ is *not* a group. We only need to find one such example.\n    *   Let's define an operation. Consider the operation given by the following rule: for any $x, y \\in G$, let $x \\cdot y = a$.\n    *   This can be represented by a Cayley table:\n    ```\n      Â· | a   b\n    ----|-------\n      a | a   a\n      b | a   a\n    ```\n    *   Now, let's check the group axioms for this structure:\n        1.  **Closure:** All results in the table are $a$, which is an element of $G$. The closure axiom holds.\n        2.  **Associativity:** The operation is associative. For any $x, y, z \\in G$, $(x \\cdot y) \\cdot z = a \\cdot z = a$, and $x \\cdot (y \\cdot z) = x \\cdot a = a$. So associativity holds.\n        3.  **Identity Element:** We need an element $e \\in G$ such that $e \\cdot x = x \\cdot e = x$ for all $x \\in G$.\n            *   Let's test if $e=a$ is the identity. We would need $a \\cdot b = b$. But our table says $a \\cdot b = a$. So $a$ is not the identity element.\n            *   Let's test if $e=b$ is the identity. We would need $b \\cdot a = a$. This holds from the table. We would also need $b \\cdot b = b$. But our table says $b \\cdot b = a$. So $b$ is not the identity element.\n        *   Since neither element in $G$ is an identity element, the identity axiom fails.\n\n**Step 3: Conclusion.**\nSince $(G, \\cdot)$ fails the identity axiom, it is not a group. We have successfully constructed a set of size $n=2$ with a binary operation that is not a group.\nSince $n=1$ must always result in a group, the smallest integer $n$ (under the standard non-empty definition of a group) for which a set of $n$ elements can be made into a non-group is 2."
