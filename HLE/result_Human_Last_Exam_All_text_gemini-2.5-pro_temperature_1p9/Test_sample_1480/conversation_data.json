    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rule activation level.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal of the Question**\n\nThe question asks to calculate the \"rule activation level\" for an Interval Type-3 Fuzzy Set (IT3FS). We are given two key values: the activation of the rule's antecedent part (`Phi_k(x')`) and the membership grade in the rule's consequent part (`μG_k_j(y_j)`). The calculation should use a t-norm operation.\n\n**2. Analyze the Provided Information**\n\n*   **Interval Type-3 Fuzzy Set (IT3FS):** This indicates that we are working within an advanced fuzzy logic framework. IT3FSs are used to handle very high levels of uncertainty. However, the problem simplifies the inputs to single, crisp numbers, suggesting we should focus on the fundamental calculation that underpins the system.\n*   **`Phi_k(x') = 0.7`:** This value represents the firing strength or degree of fulfillment of the *antecedent* (the \"IF\" part) of the k-th rule for a given input `x'`. In essence, it tells us how \"true\" the premise of the rule is, with a value of 0.7.\n*   **`μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9`:** This value is the membership grade of a specific output value `y_j` in the original *consequent* (the \"THEN\" part) fuzzy set `G_k` for the k-th rule.\n*   **T-norm Operation:** This is a class of fuzzy logic operators used to represent the intersection or logical \"AND\". In the context of fuzzy rules, it is used in the implication step to combine the antecedent's firing strength with the consequent's fuzzy set.\n\n**3. Deconstruct the Fuzzy Inference Process**\n\nA fuzzy inference system typically follows these steps for each rule:\n1.  **Antecedent Evaluation:** Calculate the firing strength of the rule's antecedent based on the system inputs. This value is given as `Phi_k(x') = 0.7`.\n2.  **Implication:** Apply the firing strength to the consequent fuzzy set. This step determines the output fuzzy set for that single rule. The term \"rule activation level\" in this context refers to the result of this implication for a specific output point.\n3.  **Aggregation:** Combine the output fuzzy sets from all rules into a single fuzzy set (this step is not relevant for this question).\n\nThe question focuses on Step 2, the **Implication** step. The goal is to determine the membership grade of `y_j` in the output fuzzy set that results from applying rule `k`.\n\n**4. The Role of the T-norm in Implication**\n\nThe implication step calculates the membership grade of the rule's output by combining the antecedent firing strength (`Phi_k(x')`) with the consequent membership grade (`μG_k_j(y_j)`). The formula is:\n\n`Output Activation(y_j) = t-norm(Antecedent Firing Strength, Consequent Membership Grade)`\n`Output Activation(y_j) = t-norm(Phi_k(x'), μG_k_j(y_j))`\n\n**5. Careful Points and Selection of a Specific T-norm**\n\n*   The question does not specify *which* t-norm to use. The two most common t-norms used for implication in fuzzy systems are:\n    *   **Minimum t-norm (used in Mamdani inference):** `t-norm(a, b) = min(a, b)`. This is the most widely used and standard t-norm for this purpose. It effectively \"clips\" the consequent fuzzy set at the level of the antecedent's firing strength.\n    *   **Product t-norm (used in Larsen inference):** `t-norm(a, b) = a * b`. This \"scales\" the consequent fuzzy set.\n*   Since the problem is stated generally, the most standard and common choice, the **minimum t-norm**, is the appropriate one to assume. This choice reflects the fundamental operation in the most common type of fuzzy inference system (Mamdani).\n\n**6. Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\n1.  **Identify the values:**\n    *   Antecedent Firing Strength: `Phi_k(x') = 0.7`\n    *   Consequent Membership Grade: `μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9`\n\n2.  **Select the t-norm:** We will use the standard minimum t-norm.\n    *   `t-norm(a, b) = min(a, b)`\n\n3.  **Apply the formula:**\n    *   Rule Activation Level = `min(Phi_k(x'), μG_k_j(y_j))`\n    *   Rule Activation Level = `min(0.7, 0.9)`\n\n4.  **Compute the final value:**\n    *   `min(0.7, 0.9) = 0.7`\n\n**Final Answer Acquisition**\n\nThe activation level of the rule's output at point `y_j` is determined by applying the antecedent's firing strength (0.7) to the consequent's membership grade (0.9) using the minimum t-norm. The result is the smaller of the two values.\n\n<<<0.7>>>"
