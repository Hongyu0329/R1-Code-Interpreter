    "An analysis of the question step-by-step to acquire the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the definitions**\n\n*   **Graph on n=128 vertices:** We have a graph `G` with a vertex set `V` where `|V| = 128`.\n*   **Clique:** A clique is a subset of vertices `S ⊆ V` such that for every two distinct vertices `u, v ∈ S`, the edge `(u, v)` is in `G`. The size of the clique is `|S|`.\n*   **Induced Subgraph:** For a subset of vertices `S ⊆ V`, the induced subgraph `G[S]` is the graph whose vertex set is `S` and whose edge set consists of all the edges in `G` that have both endpoints in `S`.\n*   **Clique size appearing as an induced subgraph:** If there is a clique of size `k` (let the vertex set be `S`), then the induced subgraph `G[S]` is a complete graph `K_k`. The question asks for the number of different values of `k` for which such an induced subgraph `K_k` exists within a single graph `G`.\n*   **The Goal:** We want to find the maximum possible value for `m`, where `m` is the number of distinct clique sizes `s_1, s_2, ..., s_m` that can be found as induced subgraphs in a single graph `G` with 128 vertices.\n\n**Step 2: Establishing an upper bound**\n\n1.  Let a graph `G` on `n=128` vertices be given.\n2.  Suppose there is an induced subgraph isomorphic to `K_k`, a complete graph of size `k`.\n3.  This induced subgraph is formed on some subset of vertices `S` from the graph `G`.\n4.  The size of this subset `S` must be `k`.\n5.  Since `S` is a subset of the vertex set `V` of `G`, its size cannot exceed the total number of vertices.\n6.  Therefore, `k = |S| ≤ |V| = 128`.\n7.  A clique must have at least one vertex, so the size `k` must be a positive integer, i.e., `k ≥ 1`.\n8.  This means that any possible clique size `k` must be an integer in the range `1 ≤ k ≤ 128`.\n9.  The set of all possible clique sizes that can appear in `G` must be a subset of `{1, 2, 3, ..., 128}`.\n10. The number of different clique sizes, `m`, is the cardinality of this set. Thus, `m` cannot be greater than the cardinality of `{1, 2, 3, ..., 128}`, which is 128.\n11. We have established an upper bound: the maximum possible number of different clique sizes is at most 128.\n\n**Step 3: Proving the upper bound is achievable**\n\n1.  To show that 128 is the maximum possible number, we need to construct a graph `G` on 128 vertices that actually contains induced cliques of 128 different sizes.\n2.  This means we need to find a graph `G` that has induced subgraphs isomorphic to `K_k` for all `k ∈ {1, 2, ..., 128}`.\n3.  Let's consider the complete graph on 128 vertices, `G = K_{128}`. In this graph, every pair of distinct vertices is connected by an edge.\n4.  Let `k` be any integer such that `1 ≤ k ≤ 128`.\n5.  We can choose any subset of vertices `S` from `G` with size `|S| = k`.\n6.  Now, let's examine the induced subgraph `G[S]`. By definition, its vertex set is `S`, and its edges are all the edges from `G` between vertices in `S`.\n7.  Since `G` is a complete graph (`K_{128}`), for any pair of distinct vertices `u, v` in `S`, the edge `(u, v)` exists in `G`.\n8.  Therefore, the induced subgraph `G[S]` contains all possible edges between its `k` vertices. This means `G[S]` is a complete graph of size `k`, i.e., `G[S]` is isomorphic to `K_k`.\n9.  Since we can do this for any `k` from 1 to 128, the graph `G = K_{128}` contains induced cliques of all sizes from 1 to 128.\n10. The set of clique sizes for `K_{128}` is `{1, 2, ..., 128}`, and the number of different sizes is 128.\n\n**Step 4: Conclusion**\n\nWe have shown that for any graph on 128 vertices, the number of different clique sizes cannot exceed 128. We have also shown that the complete graph `K_{128}` achieves this bound. Therefore, the maximum possible number of different clique sizes that can simultaneously appear as induced subgraphs of a single graph on 128 vertices is 128.\n\n<<<128>>>"
