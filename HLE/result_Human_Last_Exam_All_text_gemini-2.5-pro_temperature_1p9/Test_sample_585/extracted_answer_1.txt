Σ' = J_l(δ) * Σ * J_l(δ)^T

where:
*   `δ` is the mean of the attitude deviation vector before the reset (`δ = \hat{\delta}` from the problem description).
*   `Σ` is the covariance of the attitude deviation before the reset.
*   `J_l(δ)` is the Left Jacobian of the Special Orthogonal group SO(3), evaluated at `δ`. The formula for the Left Jacobian matrix is:
    J_l(δ) = I + (1-cos(θ))/θ^2 * hat(δ) + (θ-sin(θ))/θ^3 * hat(δ)^2
    *   `θ = ||δ||` is the magnitude (angle) of the rotation vector `δ`.
    *   `hat(δ)` is the 3x3 skew-symmetric matrix corresponding to the vector `δ`.
    *   `I` is the 3x3 identity matrix.
