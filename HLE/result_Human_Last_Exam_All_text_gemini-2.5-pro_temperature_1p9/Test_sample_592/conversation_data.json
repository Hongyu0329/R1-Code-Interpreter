    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the core elements of the question:**\n    *   **Movie:** *Ovosodo* (Hard Boiled Egg)\n    *   **Year:** 1997\n    *   **Character:** Tommaso (played by Marco Cocci)\n    *   **Action:** Moves to a city in the United States.\n    *   **Goal:** Name the specific US city.\n\n2.  **Analyze the character's role in the film's plot:**\n    *   The protagonist of *Ovosodo* is Piero Mansani. Tommaso is Piero's best friend from a wealthy family.\n    *   A central theme of the movie is the contrast between their life paths after high school. Piero remains in their hometown of Livorno, while Tommaso chooses to leave and explore the world.\n\n3.  **Trace Tommaso's storyline:**\n    *   After completing his final exams (la maturità), Tommaso decides not to follow a conventional path like attending a university in Italy.\n    *   He uses his family's financial resources to travel. His primary destination and the city he moves to in the United States to live and study is a key plot point.\n\n4.  **Pinpoint the specific US city:**\n    *   In the film, Tommaso moves to **New York City**.\n    *   This is shown through scenes where he communicates with Piero from New York and later when he returns to Livorno for a visit, appearing \"Americanized.\" His life in New York serves as a stark contrast to Piero's life, which has remained in Livorno.\n\n**Careful points to consider:**\n\n*   **Don't confuse the characters:** The question is about Tommaso, not the main character, Piero.\n*   **Verify the location:** The movie makes it clear that his destination is New York City. This isn't just a brief travel stop; it's where he establishes a new life for a period.\n*   **Context is key:** Understanding the theme of diverging paths between the two friends helps confirm why Tommaso's move to a major international city like New York is significant to the story.\n\nBy following these steps, we can confidently determine the correct city.\n\n<<<New York City>>>"
