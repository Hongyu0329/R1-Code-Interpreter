    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Definition of the Graph \\( G \\)**\n\nThe question states that \\( G \\) is the \"sum of three cycles of length \\( n \\)\".\n*   **Cycles**: Let the three cycles be \\( C_A, C_B, C_C \\). Each is a cycle with \\( n \\) vertices. For a graph to be a cycle, we must have \\( n \\ge 3 \\). We assume these three cycles are vertex-disjoint. Let their vertex sets be \\( V_A, V_B, V_C \\), each of size \\( n \\).\n*   **Graph Sum**: In graph theory, the \"sum\" or \"join\" of graphs \\( G_1 \\) and \\( G_2 \\), denoted \\( G_1 + G_2 \\), is formed by taking the disjoint union of the two graphs and adding an edge between every vertex of \\( G_1 \\) and every vertex of \\( G_2 \\).\n*   **Structure of \\( G \\)**: Applying this definition, \\( G = C_A + C_B + C_C \\). This means that in addition to the edges within each cycle, every vertex in \\( V_A \\) is connected to every vertex in \\( V_B \\) and \\( V_C \\), and every vertex in \\( V_B \\) is connected to every vertex in \\( V_C \\).\n\n**Careful Point 1**: It is crucial to correctly interpret \"sum of graphs\" as the graph join operation. This structure implies a high level of connectivity between the parts of the graph.\n\n**Step 2: Formulate the Chromatic Number of \\( G \\)**\n\nThe chromatic number \\( \\chi(G) \\) is the minimum number of colors needed to color the vertices of \\( G \\) such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.\n*   Let's consider the sets of colors used for \\( V_A, V_B, \\) and \\( V_C \\).\n*   Because every vertex in \\( V_A \\) is connected to every vertex in \\( V_B \\), the set of colors used to color \\( V_A \\) must be completely disjoint from the set of colors used for \\( V_B \\).\n*   The same logic applies to pairs (\\(V_A, V_C\\)) and (\\(V_B, V_C\\)). The color sets for all three parts must be mutually disjoint.\n*   This leads to a fundamental property of the graph join: \\( \\chi(G_1 + G_2 + \\ldots + G_k) = \\chi(G_1) + \\chi(G_2) + \\ldots + \\chi(G_k) \\).\n*   In our case, \\( \\chi(G) = \\chi(C_A) + \\chi(C_B) + \\chi(C_C) \\). Since all three cycles have length \\( n \\), they all have the same chromatic number, \\( \\chi(C_n) \\).\n*   Therefore, we have the formula: \\( \\chi(G) = 3 \\cdot \\chi(C_n) \\).\n\n**Careful Point 2**: This additive property for the chromatic number of a graph join is the key to simplifying the problem.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Chromatic Number of a Cycle, \\( \\chi(C_n) \\)**\n\nThe chromatic number of a cycle graph depends on whether its length \\( n \\) is even or odd.\n*   **Case 1: \\( n \\) is even (\\( n \\ge 4 \\))**: A cycle of even length is a bipartite graph. Its vertices can be properly colored using just two colors (by alternating them around the cycle). Thus, if \\( n \\) is even, \\( \\chi(C_n) = 2 \\).\n*   **Case 2: \\( n \\) is odd (\\( n \\ge 3 \\))**: A cycle of odd length is not bipartite. If you try to color it with two colors, you will find that the \\( n \\)-th vertex is adjacent to vertices of both colors, forcing the need for a third color. Thus, if \\( n \\) is odd, \\( \\chi(C_n) = 3 \\).\n\n**Careful Point 3**: One must account for the two different cases for \\( \\chi(C_n) \\) based on the parity of \\( n \\). This variation is what leads to the \"maximal\" value.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Maximal Chromatic Number of \\( G \\)**\n\nWe can now find the chromatic number of \\( G \\) for both even and odd \\( n \\) and identify the maximum possible value.\n*   **If \\( n \\) is even**:\n    \\( \\chi(G) = 3 \\cdot \\chi(C_n) = 3 \\cdot 2 = 6 \\).\n*   **If \\( n \\) is odd**:\n    \\( \\chi(G) = 3 \\cdot \\chi(C_n) = 3 \\cdot 3 = 9 \\).\n\nThe question asks for the \"maximal chromatic number\" of \\( G \\). This implies we should find the maximum value that \\( \\chi(G) \\) can attain over all possible choices for the length \\( n \\). The set of possible values for \\( \\chi(G) \\) is {6, 9}. The maximum value in this set is 9. This value is achieved whenever \\( n \\) is chosen to be an odd integer, such as \\( n = 3, 5, 7, \\dots \\).\n\n**Careful Point 4**: The word \"maximal\" directs us to choose the scenario (\\( n \\) is odd) that results in the highest chromatic number.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nThe analysis shows that the chromatic number of \\( G \\) depends on the parity of \\( n \\).\n1.  For any even \\( n \\ge 4 \\), \\( \\chi(G) = 6 \\).\n2.  For any odd \\( n \\ge 3 \\), \\( \\chi(G) = 9 \\).\nThe maximal value among these possibilities is 9.\n\n<<<9>>>"
