    "This problem requires finding sufficient conditions for the existence of a special type of fixed point for a system of three functions, which we call an \"FGH-tripled fixed point\". We can solve this by using the celebrated Banach Fixed Point Theorem on a suitable product space.\n\n### Step 1: Defining the FGH-Tripled Fixed Point\n\nFirst, let's formally define the object of interest. We are given three sets `X`, `Y`, `Z` and three functions:\n1.  `F: X × Y × Z → X`\n2.  `G: Y × X × Y → Y`\n3.  `H: Z × Y × X → Z`\n    (Note: The question listed `G` twice; we assume the third function is `H` with the signature `H:Z*Y*X→Z` based on the context of tripled fixed points.)\n\nAn **FGH-tripled fixed point** is a triplet `(x, y, z)` where `x ∈ X`, `y ∈ Y`, and `z ∈ Z` that simultaneously satisfies the following system of equations:\n*   `F(x, y, z) = x`\n*   `G(y, x, y) = y`\n*   `H(z, y, x) = z`\n\n### Step 2: Reformulating as a Standard Fixed Point Problem\n\nThe problem of finding a tripled fixed point for three functions can be simplified by reformulating it as a standard fixed point problem for a single function on a product space.\n\n*   **Define the product space:** Let `W = X × Y × Z`.\n*   **Define the operator on the product space:** Let's define a single operator `T: W → W` as follows:\n    `T(x, y, z) = (F(x, y, z), G(y, x, y), H(z, y, x))`\n*   **Equivalence:** A point `(x, y, z) ∈ W` is a fixed point of `T` if and only if `T(x, y, z) = (x, y, z)`. This is equivalent to the system of equations defining the FGH-tripled fixed point.\n\n### Step 3: Applying the Banach Fixed Point Theorem\n\nThe Banach Fixed Point Theorem provides a powerful tool for guaranteeing the existence and uniqueness of a fixed point. The theorem states that if `(W, d_W)` is a **complete metric space** and `T: W → W` is a **contraction mapping**, then `T` has a unique fixed point in `W`.\n\nThis gives us two main conditions to establish.\n\n**Careful Point 1: Completeness of the Product Space**\n\nFor `W` to be a complete metric space, the individual spaces `X`, `Y`, and `Z` must be complete metric spaces.\nLet `(X, d_X)`, `(Y, d_Y)`, and `(Z, d_Z)` be the metric spaces. We can define a metric `d_W` on the product space `W = X × Y × Z`. A standard choice is the sum metric (or `l_1` metric):\n`d_W((x₁, y₁, z₁), (x₂, y₂, z₂)) = d_X(x₁, x₂) + d_Y(y₁, y₂) + d_Z(z₁, z₂)`\nIf `(X, d_X)`, `(Y, d_Y)`, and `(Z, d_Z)` are complete, then the product space `(W, d_W)` is also complete.\n\n*   **Condition I:** The spaces **`(X, d_X)`, `(Y, d_Y)`, and `(Z, d_Z)` must be complete metric spaces.**\n\n**Careful Point 2: Contraction Mapping Condition for `T`**\n\nThe operator `T` is a contraction mapping if there exists a constant `k` with `0 ≤ k < 1` such that for any two points `w₁ = (x₁, y₁, z₁)` and `w₂ = (x₂, y₂, z₂)` in `W`, the following inequality holds:\n`d_W(T(w₁), T(w₂)) ≤ k * d_W(w₁, w₂)`\n\nLet's express this in terms of F, G, and H.\n`d_W(T(w₁), T(w₂)) = d_X(F(x₁,y₁,z₁), F(x₂,y₂,z₂)) + d_Y(G(y₁,x₁,y₁), G(y₂,x₂,y₂)) + d_Z(H(z₁,y₁,x₁), H(z₂,y₂,x₂))`\n\nTo ensure `T` is a contraction, we need to impose contraction-like conditions on the individual functions F, G, and H. Assume there exist non-negative constants such that for all `x₁,x₂ ∈ X`, `y₁,y₂ ∈ Y`, `z₁,z₂ ∈ Z`:\n\na.  `d_X(F(x₁,y₁,z₁), F(x₂,y₂,z₂)) ≤ a₁ d_X(x₁,x₂) + a₂ d_Y(y₁,y₂) + a₃ d_Z(z₁,z₂)`\nb.  `d_Y(G(y₁,x₁,y₁), G(y₂,x₂,y₂)) ≤ b₁ d_X(x₁,x₂) + b₂ d_Y(y₁,y₂)`\n    *(Note: Since `G(y,x,y)` only depends on inputs from `X` and `Y`, its contraction inequality only involves `d_X` and `d_Y`.)*\nc.  `d_Z(H(z₁,y₁,x₁), H(z₂,y₂,x₂)) ≤ c₁ d_X(x₁,x₂) + c₂ d_Y(y₁,y₂) + c₃ d_Z(z₁,z₂)`\n    *(Note: We've used coefficients `a_i`, `b_i`, `c_i` to represent the \"influence\" of each input variable's distance on the output distance.)*\n\nNow, let's sum these inequalities:\n`d_W(T(w₁), T(w₂)) ≤ (a₁d_X+a₂d_Y+a₃d_Z) + (b₁d_X+b₂d_Y) + (c₁d_X+c₂d_Y+c₃d_Z)`\n\nGroup the terms by the metric:\n`d_W(T(w₁), T(w₂)) ≤ (a₁+b₁+c₁)d_X(x₁,x₂) + (a₂+b₂+c₂)d_Y(y₁,y₂) + (a₃+c₃)d_Z(z₁,z₂)`\n\nLet `k_x = a₁+b₁+c₁`, `k_y = a₂+b₂+c₂`, `k_z = a₃+c₃`. Let `k = max(k_x, k_y, k_z)`.\nThen:\n`d_W(T(w₁), T(w₂)) ≤ k * d_X(x₁,x₂) + k * d_Y(y₁,y₂) + k * d_Z(z₁,z₂)`\n`d_W(T(w₁), T(w₂)) ≤ k * (d_X(x₁,x₂) + d_Y(y₁,y₂) + d_Z(z₁,z₂))`\n`d_W(T(w₁), T(w₂)) ≤ k * d_W(w₁, w₂)`\n\nFor `T` to be a contraction, we need `k < 1`.\n\n*   **Condition II:** The functions `F`, `G`, `H` must satisfy the contraction-type inequalities (a), (b), and (c) above, with the constants satisfying **`max(a₁+b₁+c₁, a₂+b₂+c₂, a₃+c₃) < 1`**.\n\n### Final Answer: The Conditions\n\nCombining these findings, we can state a theorem that provides a set of sufficient conditions for the existence and uniqueness of an FGH-tripled fixed point.\n\nLet `(X, d_X)`, `(Y, d_Y)`, and `(Z, d_Z)` be complete metric spaces. Let `F:X×Y×Z→X`, `G:Y×X×Y→Y`, and `H:Z×Y×X→Z` be mappings. An FGH-tripled fixed point exists and is unique if there are non-negative constants `a₁, a₂, a₃, b₁, b₂, c₁, c₂, c₃` such that:\n\n1.  For all `x₁,x₂ ∈ X`, `y₁,y₂ ∈ Y`, `z₁,z₂ ∈ Z`, the following inequalities hold:\n    *   `d_X(F(x₁,y₁,z₁), F(x₂,y₂,z₂)) ≤ a₁ d_X(x₁,x₂) + a₂ d_Y(y₁,y₂) + a₃ d_Z(z₁,z₂)`\n    *   `d_Y(G(y₁,x₁,y₁), G(y₂,x₂,y₂)) ≤ b₁ d_X(x₁,x₂) + b₂ d_Y(y₁,y₂)`\n    *   `d_Z(H(z₁,y₁,x₁), H(z₂,y₂,x₂)) ≤ c₁ d_X(x₁,x₂) + c₂ d_Y(y₁,y₂) + c₃ d_Z(z₁,z₂)`\n\n2.  The sum of the coefficients for each corresponding distance component is less than 1. That is:\n    `max(a₁ + b₁ + c₁, a₂ + b₂ + c₂, a₃ + c₃) < 1`\n\n<<<Let `(X, d_X)`, `(Y, d_Y)`, and `(Z, d_Z)` be complete metric spaces. Let the functions be `F:X×Y×Z→X`, `G:Y×X×Y→Y`, and `H:Z×Y×X→Z`.\nA sufficient set of conditions for the existence of a unique FGH-tripled fixed point `(x, y, z)` satisfying `F(x,y,z)=x`, `G(y,x,y)=y`, and `H(z,y,x)=z` is as follows:\n\nThere exist non-negative constants `a₁, a₂, a₃, b₁, b₂, c₁, c₂, c₃` such that for all `x₁,x₂ ∈ X`, `y₁,y₂ ∈ Y`, `z₁,z₂ ∈ Z`:\n\n1.  **Contraction-like inequalities for each function:**\n    *   `d_X(F(x₁,y₁,z₁), F(x₂,y₂,z₂)) ≤ a₁d_X(x₁,x₂) + a₂d_Y(y₁,y₂) + a₃d_Z(z₁,z₂)`\n    *   `d_Y(G(y₁,x₁,y₁), G(y₂,x₂,y₂)) ≤ b₁d_X(x₁,x₂) + b₂d_Y(y₁,y₂)`\n    *   `d_Z(H(z₁,y₁,x₁), H(z₂,y₂,x₂)) ≤ c₁d_X(x₁,x₂) + c₂d_Y(y₁,y₂) + c₃d_Z(z₁,z₂)`\n\n2.  **Overall contraction condition on the constants:**\n    The maximum of the sums of the coefficients corresponding to each space's metric is less than 1.\n    `max(a₁ + b₁ + c₁, a₂ + b₂ + c₂, a₃ + c₃) < 1`>>>"
