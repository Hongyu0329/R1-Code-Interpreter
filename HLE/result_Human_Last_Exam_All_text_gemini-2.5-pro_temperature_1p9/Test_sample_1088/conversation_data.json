    "To determine the number of primitive Gaussians in a 6-311G** basis set, we need to analyze the notation and apply it to a specific atom or molecule. The number of functions is not a single value for the basis set itself, but depends on the chemical system being studied.\n\nThe question is ambiguous as it does not specify an atom or molecule. A common practice for such questions is to consider a simple, representative molecule that utilizes all features of the basis set notation. Methane (CH4) is an excellent candidate because it contains both a \"heavy atom\" (Carbon) and hydrogen atoms, which are treated differently by the `**` polarization functions. We will proceed by calculating the number of primitive Gaussians for CH4.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Careful Point 1: The meaning of the notation `6-311G**`**\n\nThe Pople-style basis set notation `6-311G**` can be broken down as follows:\n*   **`6-`**: This refers to the core atomic orbitals. Each core orbital is represented by a single contracted Gaussian function (CGF) which is built from a linear combination of **6** primitive Gaussian functions (PGFs).\n*   **`-311`**: This describes the valence atomic orbitals. They are represented by a \"triple-zeta\" scheme, meaning each valence orbital is described by three separate CGFs.\n    *   The first CGF is composed of **3** PGFs.\n    *   The second CGF is an uncontracted PGF (composed of **1** PGF).\n    *   The third CGF is also an uncontracted PGF (composed of **1** PGF).\n    *   In total, each valence orbital is described by `3 + 1 + 1 = 5` PGFs.\n*   **`G`**: Simply stands for Gaussian, indicating the type of functions used.\n*   **`**` (two asterisks): These denote the addition of polarization functions to improve the description of molecular geometry and bonding.\n    *   The first asterisk (`*`) applies to all non-hydrogen (\"heavy\") atoms. It adds one set of d-type polarization functions. A standard set of Cartesian d-functions consists of 6 functions ($d_{x^2}, d_{y^2}, d_{z^2}, d_{xy}, d_{xz}, d_{yz}$), each being a single PGF. This adds **6 PGFs** to each heavy atom.\n    *   The second asterisk (`**`) applies to hydrogen atoms. It adds one set of p-type polarization functions. A set of p-functions consists of 3 functions ($p_x, p_y, p_z$), each being a single PGF. This adds **3 PGFs** to each hydrogen atom.\n\n---\n### **Step 1: Calculate Primitives for a Hydrogen (H) Atom**\n\n*   **Electronic Structure:** A hydrogen atom has one electron in the 1s orbital. It has no core electrons.\n*   **Core Primitives:** Since there are no core electrons, the `6-` rule does not contribute any PGFs. (0 PGFs)\n*   **Valence Primitives:** The 1s orbital is a valence orbital. Applying the `-311` rule, it is described by `3 + 1 + 1 = 5` s-type PGFs.\n*   **Polarization Primitives:** The `**` notation adds a set of p-functions to hydrogen. This contributes **3** p-type PGFs.\n*   **Total for H:** `0 (core) + 5 (valence) + 3 (polarization) = 8` primitive Gaussians.\n\n---\n### **Step 2: Calculate Primitives for a Carbon (C) Atom**\n\n*   **Electronic Structure:** A carbon atom has the electron configuration $1s^2 2s^2 2p^2$. The 1s orbital is the core, and the 2s and 2p orbitals are the valence shell.\n*   **Core Primitives:** The 1s core orbital is described by the `6-` rule, so it is built from **6** s-type PGFs.\n*   **Valence Primitives:**\n    *   The 2s valence orbital is described by the `-311` rule, contributing `3 + 1 + 1 = 5` s-type PGFs.\n    *   The 2p valence orbitals ($2p_x, 2p_y, 2p_z$) are also described by the `-311` rule. Each of the three p-orbitals is built from `3 + 1 + 1 = 5` p-type PGFs. Total for the 2p shell is `3 × 5 = 15` p-type PGFs.\n    *   Total valence primitives: `5 (from 2s) + 15 (from 2p) = 20` PGFs.\n*   **Polarization Primitives:** The `*` notation adds a set of d-functions to heavy atoms like carbon. This contributes **6** d-type PGFs.\n*   **Total for C:** `6 (core) + 20 (valence) + 6 (polarization) = 32` primitive Gaussians.\n\n**Careful Point 2:** Note that the same count (32 PGFs) applies to other second-row heavy atoms like Nitrogen (N) and Oxygen (O) as they have the same core/valence orbital structure (1s, 2s, 2p).\n\n---\n### **Step 3: Calculate Total Primitives for Methane (CH4)**\n\nNow we can calculate the total number of PGFs for the methane molecule by summing the contributions from its constituent atoms.\n\n*   **Composition:** 1 Carbon atom and 4 Hydrogen atoms.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    *   Contribution from Carbon: 1 atom × 32 PGFs/atom = 32 PGFs.\n    *   Contribution from Hydrogen: 4 atoms × 8 PGFs/atom = 32 PGFs.\n    *   **Total:** `32 (for C) + 32 (for 4H) = 64` primitive Gaussians.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis for a methane (CH4) molecule, the total number of primitive Gaussians is 64.\n\n<<<64>>>"
