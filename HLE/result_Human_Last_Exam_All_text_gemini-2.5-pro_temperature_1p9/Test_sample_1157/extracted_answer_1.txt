**Management Procedures and Cellular Analysis:**

The appropriate management is a phased approach, prioritizing systemic health.

*   **Phase I (Emergency):** The immediate priority is a **medical consultation to begin treatment for her uncontrolled diabetes mellitus**. Dental management involves gentle cleaning of the sockets, prescription of systemic antibiotics and analgesics, and ruling out alveolar fractures. **Replantation of the avulsed teeth is contraindicated** due to the 28-hour delay.
*   **Phase II (Intermediate):** While her diabetes is being brought under control and the sockets are healing (a process that will be slow), a **temporary acrylic removable partial denture ("flipper")** should be fabricated for aesthetics and space maintenance.
*   **Phase III (Definitive):** Once her glycemic levels are stable (HbA1c < 7%) and the ridge has healed, a definitive prosthesis can be made.
*   **Cells of Interest:** The key cells are the **necrotic Periodontal Ligament (PDL) cells** (dictating no replantation), **impaired Osteoblasts and Osteoclasts** (affecting bone healing), and **suppressed immune cells like Neutrophils and Macrophages** (increasing infection risk). The underlying issue stems from dysfunction related to **pancreatic Î²-cells**.

**Denture Replacement Details:**

*   **Type and Material:** The most appropriate choice is a **Cast Metal Framework Removable Partial Denture (RPD)**. The framework should be made of a **Cobalt-Chrome alloy** for its rigidity and strength, with teeth and the gingival portion made of **acrylic resin**. This design is superior to a permanent all-acrylic denture because it is tooth-supported, more hygienic, and more stable.
*   **Abutment Teeth and Reasons:**
    *   **Primary Abutments:** The **left second premolar** (posterior to the space) and the **left central incisor** (anterior to the space). These teeth will provide direct support and retention for the prosthesis.
    *   **Essential Stabilizing Abutment:** At least one molar on the contralateral (right) side, such as the **right first molar**.
    *   **Reasoning:
