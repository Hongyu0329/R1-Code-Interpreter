    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Geometry and Orientation of the Tank**\n*   The tank has the shape of a regular icosahedron. An icosahedron is a polyhedron with 20 identical faces, where each face is an equilateral triangle. It has 12 vertices and 30 edges. It possesses a high degree of symmetry.\n*   The tank is \"standing on one of its faces\". This means one of the 20 triangular faces is horizontal and serves as the base of the tank.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Symmetries in this Orientation**\n*   **Central Symmetry:** A regular icosahedron has a center of symmetry (or point of inversion). For any point P in the icosahedron, there is an opposite point P' such that the center of the icosahedron is the midpoint of the line segment PP'.\n*   **Parallel Faces:** Because it is a regular polyhedron, when it rests on one face, there is another face directly opposite and parallel to the base face. This parallel face is at the top of the icosahedron.\n*   **Rotational Symmetry:** The axis that passes vertically through the center of the bottom face and the center of the top face is an axis of 3-fold rotational symmetry. This means rotating the icosahedron by 120째 or 240째 around this axis leaves it unchanged.\n\n**Step 3: Locate the Water Surface**\n*   The tank is \"half-filled with water\". This means the volume of the water is exactly one-half of the total volume of the icosahedron.\n*   The surface of the water in a stationary tank under gravity is always a horizontal plane.\n*   Because of the icosahedron's central symmetry, the horizontal plane that divides the total volume into two equal halves must pass through the geometric center of the icosahedron.\n*   Therefore, the water surface is the horizontal cross-section of the icosahedron at its very center, halfway between the bottom face and the top face.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Shape of the Central Cross-Section**\n*   The question now simplifies to: What is the shape of the horizontal cross-section that passes through the center of an icosahedron oriented on one of its faces?\n*   **Identifying Intersected Edges:** The central plane will not pass through any vertices. It will intersect the edges that connect a vertex in the upper half of the icosahedron to a vertex in the lower half.\n*   **Vertex Layers:** In this face-down orientation, the 12 vertices of the icosahedron are arranged in four distinct horizontal layers of three vertices each. Two layers are in the upper half, and two are in the lower half, positioned symmetrically around the central plane.\n*   **Edge Connectivity:** The edges of the icosahedron only connect vertices in adjacent layers. The central plane passes between the two middle layers of vertices. A detailed analysis of the icosahedron's structure shows that there are exactly six edges that connect the three vertices of the upper-middle layer to the three vertices of the lower-middle layer.\n*   **Number of Sides:** Since the central plane cuts through these six edges, the resulting cross-section will have six vertices (the points of intersection), and thus it is a hexagon.\n\n**Step 5: Determine if the Hexagon is Regular**\n*   We use the symmetries identified in Step 2.\n*   **Effect of Rotational Symmetry:** The icosahedron has a 3-fold rotational symmetry axis perpendicular to the plane of the cross-section. Any cross-section perpendicular to this axis must also have 3-fold rotational symmetry. This means that rotating the hexagon by 120째 leaves it unchanged. This implies that alternate sides are equal in length, and alternate angles are equal.\n*   **Effect of Central Symmetry:** The cross-section plane passes through the center of symmetry of the icosahedron. Therefore, the hexagon itself must be centrally symmetric. This means that opposite sides are parallel and equal in length, and opposite vertices are equidistant from the center.\n*   **Conclusion on Regularity:** A hexagon that has both 3-fold rotational symmetry and central symmetry must be a **regular hexagon**. All its sides will be equal, and all its interior angles will be equal (to 120째).\n\n**Final Answer:**\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the shape of the water surface is a regular hexagon.\n\n<<<A regular hexagon>>>"
