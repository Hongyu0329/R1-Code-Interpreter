    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction between butadiene and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the reactants and the type of reaction.**\n*   **Reactant 1:** Butadiene (specifically, 1,3-butadiene). Its structure is CH₂=CH−CH=CH₂. This is a conjugated diene, a molecule with two double bonds separated by one single bond. It provides 4 π-electrons for the reaction.\n*   **Reactant 2:** 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene. Its structure is CCl₂=CF₂. This is an alkene (a dienophile, \"diene-loving\"), providing 2 π-electrons. The highly electronegative halogen atoms (Cl and F) withdraw electron density from the double bond, making it electron-deficient and thus a very good dienophile.\n*   **Reaction Type:** The reaction between a conjugated diene and a dienophile is a **Diels-Alder reaction**. This is a [4+2] cycloaddition, meaning a 4-π-electron system (the diene) reacts with a 2-π-electron system (the dienophile) to form a six-membered ring.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the connectivity of the product.**\nIn a Diels-Alder reaction, a new six-membered ring is formed through a concerted mechanism.\n1.  The diene (butadiene) reacts in its *s-cis* conformation.\n2.  Two new single (sigma) bonds are formed between the ends of the diene (C1 and C4) and the two carbons of the dienophile's double bond.\n3.  The two double bonds in the diene are converted into one double bond located between C2 and C3 of the original diene.\n4.  The double bond of the dienophile becomes a single bond.\n\nThe connectivity of the atoms in the resulting six-membered ring will be:\n-CH₂(C1)−CH(C2)=CH(C3)−CH₂(C4)−C(dienophile)−C(dienophile)−\n\nLet's place the substituents from the dienophile onto the ring structure. The dienophile CCl₂=CF₂ has one carbon atom bonded to two chlorine atoms (CCl₂) and the other to two fluorine atoms (CF₂).\nThe resulting ring will therefore contain the sequence of atoms: -CH₂−CH=CH−CH₂−C(Cl₂)−C(F₂)-.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the regiochemistry.**\nRegiochemistry refers to which of the two possible constitutional isomers is formed when both the diene and dienophile are unsymmetrical.\n*   The diene, 1,3-butadiene (CH₂=CH-CH=CH₂), is symmetrical. It has a plane of symmetry through the central C-C single bond.\n*   The dienophile, 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene (CCl₂=CF₂), is unsymmetrical.\n\nBecause the diene is symmetrical, there is no regiochemical preference. Attaching the CCl₂ group to C1 and the CF₂ group to C4 of the diene gives one product. Attaching the CF₂ group to C1 and the CCl₂ group to C4 gives the same product (as you can obtain one from the other by simply rotating the butadiene molecule before the reaction). Therefore, only **one constitutional isomer** is formed.\n\nThe structure of the product is a cyclohexene ring where the substituent-bearing carbons are adjacent to each other.\nLet's draw the final product structure:\n      H   H\n       \\ /\n    C=C\n   /     \\\nH₂C       CH₂\n  \\       /\n   C(Cl₂)---C(F₂)\n\n**Step 4: Name the product according to IUPAC nomenclature.**\n1.  **Parent Ring:** The six-membered ring with one double bond is **cyclohexene**.\n2.  **Numbering:** According to IUPAC rules, the carbons of the double bond must be numbered C1 and C2. The numbering then continues around the ring to give the substituents the lowest possible locant numbers.\n3.  **Applying Numbering Rules:** We have the ring sequence -CH=CH-CH₂-C(Cl₂)-C(F₂)-CH₂-.\n    *   **Scheme A:** Let's number the double bond carbons as 1 and 2, and proceed around the ring towards the CCl₂ group first. The atoms are numbered: C1(CH), C2(CH), C3(CH₂), C4(CCl₂), C5(CF₂), C6(CH₂). The substituents are two chlorine atoms at position 4 and two fluorine atoms at position 5.\n    *   **Scheme B:** If we number the other way (starting from the other C of the double bond, or proceeding from C2 towards the other CH₂), we get: C1(CH), C2(CH), C3(CH₂), C4(CF₂), C5(CCl₂), C6(CH₂). The substituents are two fluorine atoms at position 4 and two chlorine atoms at position 5.\n4.  **Choosing the Correct Name:**\n    *   We compare the substituent locant sets: {4,4,5,5} for both schemes. They are identical.\n    *   When locant sets are identical, we assign the lower number to the substituent group that comes first alphabetically. The substituents are \"dichloro\" and \"difluoro\". \"Dichloro\" comes before \"difluoro\" alphabetically.\n    *   In Scheme A, \"dichloro\" is at position 4. In Scheme B, \"dichloro\" is at position 5.\n    *   Since 4 is lower than 5, Scheme A gives the correct IUPAC name.\n5.  **Final Name:** The product is named **4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohexene**. The \"-1-\" is omitted as it is understood in a substituted cyclohexene.\n\nFinal Answer: The product is 4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohexene.\n\n<<<4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohexene>>>"
