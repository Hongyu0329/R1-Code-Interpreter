    "To determine which battle depicted in a painting by Lady Butler was the latest historically, we need to identify her major battle paintings, find the date of the battle each one depicts, and then compare these dates.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Key Paintings by Lady Butler and their Subjects**\n\nElizabeth Thompson, Lady Butler (1846–1933) was a famous British painter of military scenes. Here is a list of some of her notable paintings and the battles they depict:\n\n*   ***Quatre Bras*** **(painted 1875):** Depicts the Battle of Quatre Bras, which took place on **June 16, 1815**, during the Napoleonic Wars.\n*   ***Scotland Forever!*** **(painted 1881):** Depicts the charge of the Royal Scots Greys at the Battle of Waterloo, which took place on **June 18, 1815**.\n*   ***The Roll Call*** **(painted 1874):** Depicts the aftermath of the Battle of Inkerman during the Crimean War. The battle took place on **November 5, 1854**.\n*   ***The Defence of Rorke's Drift*** **(painted 1880):** Depicts the Battle of Rorke's Drift during the Anglo-Zulu War, which took place on **January 22-23, 1879**.\n*   ***Floreat Etona!*** **(painted 1882):** Depicts an incident at the Battle of Laing's Nek during the First Boer War. This battle occurred on **January 28, 1881**.\n*   ***Tel-el-Kebir*** **(painted 1885):** Depicts the Battle of Tel el-Kebir during the Anglo-Egyptian War on **September 13, 1882**.\n*   ***The Camel Corps*** **(painted 1893):** Depicts a scene from the Nile Expedition (or Gordon Relief Expedition) of **1884–1885** during the Mahdist War.\n\n**Step 2: Investigate Her Later Works, Specifically from World War I**\n\nWhile famous for her Victorian-era paintings, Lady Butler continued to paint into the 20th century and depicted scenes from World War I (1914-1918). This conflict occurred later than any of the previously mentioned colonial wars. We need to identify a painting from this period.\n\n*   ***In the Retreat from Mons: The Royal Horse Guards*** **(painted 1915):** This painting depicts the British retreat following the Battle of Mons in **August 1914**.\n*   ***The Charge of the Dorset Yeomanry at Agagia, 1916*** **(painted 1917):** This work shows a cavalry charge during the Battle of Agagia, part of the Senussi Campaign in Egypt. This battle took place on **February 26, 1916**.\n\n**Step 3: Compare the Dates to Find the Latest Battle**\n\nNow we compare the dates of all the battles identified:\n\n*   Battle of Quatre Bras: 1815\n*   Battle of Waterloo: 1815\n*   Battle of Inkerman: 1854\n*   Battle of Rorke's Drift: 1879\n*   Battle of Laing's Nek: 1881\n*   Battle of Tel el-Kebir: 1882\n*   Nile Expedition: 1884-1885\n*   Retreat from Mons: 1914\n*   Battle of Agagia: **1916**\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nComparing the dates, the Battle of Agagia, which occurred on February 26, 1916, is the latest historical battle depicted in a known painting by Lady Butler.\n\n***\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n\n1.  **Painting Date vs. Battle Date:** It's crucial not to confuse the year a painting was created with the year the historical event took place. For example, *Scotland Forever!* was painted in 1881, but it depicts the Battle of Waterloo from 1815.\n2.  **Breadth of Work:** One must look beyond an artist's most famous works. While Lady Butler is strongly associated with Victorian conflicts, her career extended into the World War I era.\n3.  **Specific Event:** The painting titles are often very specific. *The Charge of the Dorset Yeomanry at Agagia, 1916* explicitly names the event and the year, making it easy to identify as a late-career depiction of a contemporary battle.\n\n<<<The Battle of Agagia>>>"
