    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the book and main character:** The question asks about the novel \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość\" (\"Perfect Imperfection\") by Jacek Dukaj. The main character of this novel is Adam Zamoyski, an astronaut from the 21st century who is revived in the distant future.\n\n2.  **Analyze the main character's relationships:** Upon his revival, Adam Zamoyski is a \"Stahs\" (Standard Human), an antique in a universe of post-humans and advanced artificial intelligences. He is guided and observed by several beings, but the most significant relationship he forms is with a post-human Inkluz.\n\n3.  **Identify the romantic partner:** The character who becomes his primary guide, protector, and eventually romantic partner is named Angelika. Their relationship is central to the plot and represents the bridge between old humanity (Adam) and the new form of existence (Angelika).\n\n4.  **Define \"marriage\" in the context of the novel:** The concept of a traditional human marriage does not directly apply in the highly advanced civilization depicted in the book. However, the bond that forms between Adam and Angelika is the novel's equivalent of a lifelong partnership or union. Their consciousnesses and fates become intertwined.\n\n5.  **Conclude the name:** Based on their deep, committed partnership which functions as the novel's version of a marriage, the character Adam Zamoyski marries is Angelika.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Main Character Identification:** It is crucial to correctly identify the protagonist as Adam Zamoyski.\n*   **Context of \"Marriage\":** The term \"marries\" should be interpreted within the sci-fi context of the book. It's not a traditional ceremony but a profound, permanent union.\n*   **Character Name:** The name of the partner is Angelika. It's important not to confuse her with other AIs or beings Adam interacts with.\n\nThe final answer is the name of the character who forms this union with Adam Zamoyski.\n\n<<<Angelika>>>"
