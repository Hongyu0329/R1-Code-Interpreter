    "This problem requires finding the steady-state probabilities for a given continuous-time Markov chain. The system is described by the Kolmogorov-Chapman forward equations.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis of the Question\n1.  **Identify the System:** The given set of equations are the Kolmogorov forward equations for a continuous-time Markov process with four states {0, 1, 2, 3}. $P_i(t)$ is the probability of being in state $i$ at time $t$, and $\\lambda_{ij}$ is the constant transition rate from state $i$ to state $j$.\n2.  **Objective:** The question asks for the value of $P_0(+\\infty) + P_1(+\\infty)$. These are the steady-state or limiting probabilities. In the steady state, the probability distribution does not change with time.\n3.  **Steady-State Condition:** The steady-state probabilities, which we denote as $p_i = P_i(+\\infty)$, are found by setting the time derivatives to zero, i.e., $P_i'(t) = 0$ for all $i$. This transforms the system of differential equations into a system of linear algebraic equations.\n4.  **Normalization:** The probabilities must sum to 1 at all times, so we have the normalization condition: $p_0 + p_1 + p_2 + p_3 = 1$. This equation is essential for finding a unique solution.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n1.  **Linear Dependence:** The first four algebraic equations obtained by setting the derivatives to zero are linearly dependent. The sum of these equations is zero. Therefore, one of them is redundant and can be omitted.\n2.  **System of Equations:** We need to solve a system of four independent linear equations for four unknowns ($p_0, p_1, p_2, p_3$). We can use three of the balance equations and the normalization equation.\n3.  **Solving Strategy:** A common strategy is to express three of the probabilities in terms of the fourth one (e.g., express $p_0, p_2, p_3$ in terms of $p_1$). Then, substitute these expressions into the normalization equation to solve for the one unknown probability. Finally, back-substitute to find the others.\n4.  **Numerical Accuracy:** When dealing with decimal values, it's best to maintain precision throughout the calculation by keeping them as fractions or expressions until the final step to avoid rounding errors.\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer with Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Write down the steady-state equations.**\nLet $p_i = P_i(+\\infty)$. Setting the derivatives $P_i'(t)$ to zero in the given system yields:\n1.  $0 = -\\lambda_{01}p_{0} + \\lambda_{10}p_{1}$\n2.  $0 = \\lambda_{01}p_{0} - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12})p_{1} + \\lambda_{21}p_{2} + \\lambda_{31}p_{3}$\n3.  $0 = \\lambda_{12}p_{1} - (\\lambda_{21}  + \\lambda_{23})p_{2}$\n4.  $0 = \\lambda_{23}p_{2} - \\lambda_{31}p_{3}$\n\nAnd the normalization condition:\n5.  $p_{0} + p_{1} + p_{2} + p_{3} = 1$\n\nSubstitute the given values for the rates $\\lambda_{ij}$:\n$\\lambda_{01} = 0.019, \\lambda_{10} = 0.65, \\lambda_{12} = 0.4, \\lambda_{21} = 0.392, \\lambda_{23} = 0.008, \\lambda_{31} = 0.008$\n\nThe equations become:\n1.  $0 = -0.019 p_0 + 0.65 p_1$\n2.  (We will not use this one as it's the most complex and redundant with the others plus the normalization).\n3.  $0 = 0.4 p_1 - (0.392 + 0.008) p_2 = 0.4 p_1 - 0.4 p_2$\n4.  $0 = 0.008 p_2 - 0.008 p_3$\n5.  $p_0 + p_1 + p_2 + p_3 = 1$\n\n**Step 2: Express $p_0, p_2, p_3$ in terms of $p_1$.**\nFrom equation (1):\n$0.019 p_0 = 0.65 p_1 \\implies p_0 = \\frac{0.65}{0.019} p_1$\n\nFrom equation (3):\n$0.4 p_1 = 0.4 p_2 \\implies p_2 = p_1$\n\nFrom equation (4):\n$0.008 p_2 = 0.008 p_3 \\implies p_3 = p_2$. Since $p_2 = p_1$, we get $p_3 = p_1$.\n\n**Step 3: Use the normalization equation to find $p_1$.**\nSubstitute the expressions for $p_0, p_2, p_3$ into the normalization equation (5):\n$p_0 + p_1 + p_2 + p_3 = 1$\n$\\left(\\frac{0.65}{0.019} p_1\\right) + p_1 + p_1 + p_1 = 1$\n$p_1 \\left( \\frac{0.65}{0.019} + 3 \\right) = 1$\n$p_1 \\left( \\frac{0.65 + 3 \\times 0.019}{0.019} \\right) = 1$\n$p_1 \\left( \\frac{0.65 + 0.057}{0.019} \\right) = 1$\n$p_1 \\left( \\frac{0.707}{0.019} \\right) = 1$\nSo, $p_1 = \\frac{0.019}{0.707}$\n\n**Step 4: Calculate $p_0$.**\nUsing the expression for $p_0$ from Step 2:\n$p_0 = \\frac{0.65}{0.019} p_1 = \\frac{0.65}{0.019} \\left( \\frac{0.019}{0.707} \\right) = \\frac{0.65}{0.707}$\n\n**Step 5: Compute the required sum $p_0 + p_1$.**\n$P_{0}(+\\infty) + P_{1}(+\\infty) = p_0 + p_1 = \\frac{0.65}{0.707} + \\frac{0.019}{0.707}$\n$p_0 + p_1 = \\frac{0.65 + 0.019}{0.707} = \\frac{0.669}{0.707}$\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the final numerical value.**\n$p_0 + p_1 = \\frac{0.669}{0.707} \\approx 0.946251768...$\n\nRounding to four decimal places gives 0.9463.\n\n<<<0.9463>>>"
