    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the ground space degeneracy of the toric code with smooth and rough holes.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Ground Space Degeneracy (GSD) of the Toric Code**\n\nThe toric code is a topological stabilizer code. Its Hamiltonian is $H = - \\sum_s A_s - \\sum_p B_p$, where $A_s$ are star operators (product of $\\sigma_x$ on edges connected to a vertex $s$) and $B_p$ are plaquette operators (product of $\\sigma_z$ on edges of a plaquette $p$).\nThe ground states are states stabilized by all operators in the Hamiltonian, i.e., $A_s|\\psi\\rangle = |\\psi\\rangle$ and $B_p|\\psi\\rangle = |\\psi\\rangle$. The ground space degeneracy (GSD) is the number of linearly independent ground states.\n\nThe GSD depends on the topology of the surface on which the code is defined. Specifically, it is determined by the number of independent logical operators that commute with the Hamiltonian but are not products of the stabilizers. For a surface with genus $g$ and no boundaries, the GSD is $4^g$, which means there are $k=2g$ logical qubits.\n\n**Step 2: Understand Smooth and Rough Boundaries (Holes)**\n\nWhen holes are cut into the lattice, boundary conditions must be specified.\n*   **Smooth boundary:** At a smooth boundary, some vertices have fewer connected edges than in the bulk. To preserve the physics, the star operators $A_s$ for vertices $s$ on the boundary are dropped from the Hamiltonian. This type of boundary is also known as an \"e-condensed\" boundary because electric charges (e-anyons, created by strings of $\\sigma_z$ operators) can terminate on this boundary without energy cost.\n*   **Rough boundary:** At a rough boundary, some plaquettes are incomplete. The plaquette operators $B_p$ for plaquettes $p$ adjacent to the boundary are dropped from the Hamiltonian. This is also known as an \"m-condensed\" boundary because magnetic fluxes (m-anyons, created by strings of $\\sigma_x$ operators) can terminate on this boundary without energy cost.\n\nThe problem asks for the GSD on a sphere (genus $g=0$) with $n$ smooth holes and $m$ rough holes.\n\n**Step 3: Count the Number of Logical Qubits (k)**\n\nThe GSD will be $2^k$, where $k$ is the number of logical qubits. A logical qubit is formed by a pair of non-commuting logical operators (e.g., a logical $X_L$ and a logical $Z_L$). We can construct logical qubits by considering how anyons can be stored or manipulated.\n\n1.  **Qubits from separating anyons of the same type:**\n    *   Consider the $n$ smooth boundaries. They can absorb e-anyons. We can create an $e-\\bar{e}$ pair in the bulk, and move them to two different smooth boundaries, say $S_i$ and $S_j$. This process defines a logical operator. With $n$ smooth boundaries acting as reservoirs for e-anyons, we can define $n-1$ independent logical qubits. This argument is valid for $n \\geq 1$. If $n=1$, we have $1-1=0$ such qubits. If $n=0$, we have none. So this contributes $\\max(0, n-1)$ qubits. These qubits are \"e-type\". A logical $Z$ for such a qubit is a string of $\\sigma_z$ connecting two smooth holes, and the corresponding logical $X$ is a loop of $\\sigma_x$ around one of the holes.\n    *   Similarly, consider the $m$ rough boundaries. They can absorb m-anyons. By separating $m-\\bar{m}$ pairs and moving them to different rough boundaries, we can define $m-1$ independent logical qubits for $m \\geq 1$. This contributes $\\max(0, m-1)$ \"m-type\" qubits.\n\n2.  **Total number of qubits:**\n    If we assume that the \"e-type\" qubits and \"m-type\" qubits are the only ones, we can sum their contributions. The logical operators for e-type qubits (e.g., $Z$ strings between smooth boundaries, $X$ loops around smooth boundaries) can be constructed to commute with the logical operators for m-type qubits (e.g., $X$ strings between rough boundaries, $Z$ loops around rough boundaries).\n    Thus, the total number of logical qubits would be the sum:\n    $k = \\max(0, n-1) + \\max(0, m-1)$\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Result and Compare with Answer Choices**\n\nLet's analyze the formula $k = \\max(0, n-1) + \\max(0, m-1)$ for different scenarios:\n*   If $n=0, m=0$ (sphere): $k = 0+0 = 0$. GSD = $2^0 = 1$. Correct.\n*   If $n > 0, m=0$ ($n$ smooth holes): $k = (n-1) + 0 = n-1$. Correct.\n*   If $n = 0, m > 0$ ($m$ rough holes): $k = 0 + (m-1) = m-1$. Correct.\n*   If $n \\ge 1, m \\ge 1$ (mixed holes): $k = (n-1) + (m-1) = n+m-2$.\n\nThe questions and answer choices in such problems often refer to the most general case where interactions between all features are possible. This corresponds to the case with $n \\ge 1$ and $m \\ge 1$.\nIn this regime, the number of logical qubits is $k=n+m-2$.\nThe ground space degeneracy is GSD = $2^k = 2^{n+m-2}$.\n\nThis result matches the formula found in several advanced papers on the topic ($k=2g+n+m-\\mathbb{I}(n>0)-\\mathbb{I}(m>0)$) for the case of a sphere ($g=0$) with at least one hole of each type ($n>0, m>0$).\n\nLet's check the given answer choices:\nA. $2^{m+n} \\implies k=m+n$\nB. $2^{m+n-2} \\implies k=m+n-2$\nC. $2^{m+n+2} \\implies k=m+n+2$\nD. $2^{2m} \\implies k=2m$\nE. $2^{2n} \\implies k=2n$\nF. $2^{(\\delta_{m,0}+\\delta_{n,0}+m+n)} \\implies k=\\delta_{m,0}+\\delta_{n,0}+m+n$\n\nOur derived result for the general case, $k=n+m-2$, matches the exponent in answer choice B.\n\n**Final Answer Calculation Summary**\n*   The ground state degeneracy is $2^k$, where $k$ is the number of logical qubits.\n*   Logical qubits can be formed by separating pairs of anyons to boundaries that condense them.\n*   $n$ smooth holes allow for the construction of $\\max(0, n-1)$ qubits associated with separating electric (e) anyons.\n*   $m$ rough holes allow for the construction of $\\max(0, m-1)$ qubits associated with separating magnetic (m) anyons.\n*   The e-type and m-type logical operators can be constructed to commute, so the total number of qubits is the sum.\n*   Assuming the most general case where $n \\geq 1$ and $m \\geq 1$, the number of qubits is $k = (n-1) + (m-1) = n+m-2$.\n*   Therefore, the ground space degeneracy is $2^{n+m-2}$.\n\n<<<B>>>"
