    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the equilibrium values of entropy and mean energy for the Bose case of light quanta using the principles of large deviation theory.\n\n### Step 1: Connecting Large Deviation Theory and Statistical Mechanics\n\nThe core idea of Large Deviation Theory (LDT) is that the probability of a macroscopic observable deviating significantly from its mean value decays exponentially with the size of the system. This provides a rigorous mathematical foundation for the principles of statistical mechanics, where equilibrium is identified with the overwhelmingly most probable macrostate.\n\n1.  **Boltzmann-Sanov Principle and Entropy:**\n    *   The **Boltzmann principle** connects entropy to the number of microscopic configurations (microstates), $W$, corresponding to a given macroscopic state (macrostate): $S = k_B \\ln W$. The equilibrium state is the one that maximizes $W$, and therefore $S$.\n    *   **Sanov's Theorem** formalizes this for systems of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) particles. It states that the probability of observing an empirical probability distribution $p$ is given by $P(p) \\approx e^{-N D_{KL}(p||q)}$, where $D_{KL}$ is the Kullback-Leibler divergence, $N$ is the number of particles, and $q$ is the underlying probability distribution. For a uniform prior $q$, minimizing $D_{KL}$ is equivalent to maximizing the Shannon entropy $S_{Shannon} = -\\sum p_i \\ln p_i$.\n    *   **For Bose-Einstein (BE) statistics** (light quanta), particles are indistinguishable and not independent. Therefore, the simple Shannon entropy is not the correct rate function. We must use the appropriate counting of microstates for bosons, $W_{BE}$. The corresponding entropy functional, which serves as the LDT rate function, is the Bose-Einstein entropy. Maximizing this specific entropy functional, subject to constraints, will give the equilibrium distribution.\n\n2.  **Cramer-Chernoff Principle and Energy Fluctuations:**\n    *   **Cram√©r's Theorem** (or Chernoff bound) deals with the probability of the sample mean of i.i.d. variables deviating from its expected value. This provides the mathematical framework for analyzing fluctuations of extensive quantities like total energy.\n    *   For a system in contact with a heat bath at temperature $T$, its total energy $E$ can fluctuate. The probability of the system having energy $E$ is proportional to the number of microstates with that energy, $\\Omega(E)$, and the Boltzmann factor from the heat bath, $e^{-\\beta E}$ (where $\\beta = 1/k_B T$). So, $P(E) \\propto \\Omega(E) e^{-\\beta E}$.\n    *   Using the Boltzmann principle $S(E)=k_B \\ln \\Omega(E)$, we get $\\ln P(E) = \\text{const} + S(E)/k_B - \\beta E$. The equilibrium energy $\\langle E \\rangle$ is the value of $E$ that maximizes this probability. This implies that for a given temperature $T$, deviations from $\\langle E \\rangle$ are \"large deviations\" governed by the rate function $I(E) = \\beta E - S(E)/k_B$. The equilibrium condition is found by setting the derivative to zero: $\\frac{d}{dE} (\\frac{S}{k_B} - \\beta E)=0$, which yields the fundamental thermodynamic relation $\\frac{dS}{dE} = \\frac{1}{T}$.\n\n### Step 2: Deriving the Equilibrium Distribution\n\nWe seek the distribution of occupation numbers $\\{n_i\\}$ over energy modes $\\{\\epsilon_i\\}$ that represents equilibrium. Following the principles outlined above, this is the distribution that maximizes the Bose-Einstein entropy subject to the constraint of a given total energy.\n\n1.  **Bose-Einstein Entropy Functional:** The number of ways to arrange $n_i$ indistinguishable bosons into $g_i$ degenerate states at energy $\\epsilon_i$ is $W_i = \\binom{n_i + g_i - 1}{n_i}$. For photons, we consider each mode (defined by wavevector and polarization) as a distinct \"state\" with degeneracy $g_i=1$. The total multiplicity is $W = \\prod_i W_i$. The entropy is $S = k_B \\ln W$. Using Stirling's approximation for large $n_i$, the entropy functional is:\n    $S[\\{n_i\\}] = k_B \\sum_i [(n_i+g_i)\\ln(n_i+g_i) - n_i\\ln n_i - g_i \\ln g_i]$.\n2.  **Maximization:** We maximize $S[\\{n_i\\}]$ subject to the constraint of constant total energy $\\sum_i n_i \\epsilon_i = E$. Since the number of photons is not conserved, there is no constraint on $\\sum_i n_i$, which implies the chemical potential is zero. Using the method of Lagrange multipliers, we maximize $J = S/k_B - \\beta(\\sum_i n_i \\epsilon_i - E)$.\n    $\\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial n_i} = \\frac{1}{k_B} \\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial n_i} - \\beta \\epsilon_i = 0$.\n    Calculating the derivative gives $\\ln(\\frac{n_i+g_i}{n_i}) = \\beta \\epsilon_i$.\n3.  **Equilibrium Distribution:** Solving for the average occupation number per state, $n_i/g_i$, we get the Bose-Einstein distribution:\n    $\\langle n_i \\rangle / g_i = \\frac{1}{e^{\\beta \\epsilon_i} - 1}$.\n    For simplicity, we treat each mode as non-degenerate ($g_i=1$), so the mean occupation number of mode $i$ is:\n    $\\langle n_i \\rangle = \\frac{1}{e^{\\beta \\epsilon_i} - 1}$.\n\n### Step 3: Calculating Equilibrium Mean Energy\n\nThe equilibrium mean energy $\\langle E \\rangle$ is the sum of the energies of all modes, weighted by their mean occupation numbers.\n\n1.  **Sum over Modes:** $\\langle E \\rangle = \\sum_i \\langle n_i \\rangle \\epsilon_i = \\sum_i \\frac{\\epsilon_i}{e^{\\beta \\epsilon_i} - 1}$.\n2.  **Continuum Limit:** For photons in a 3D box of volume $V$, the modes are dense enough to be treated as a continuum. We replace the sum with an integral over the density of states $g(\\epsilon)$. For photons (two polarization states), the density of states is:\n    $g(\\epsilon)d\\epsilon = \\frac{8\\pi V}{(hc)^3} \\epsilon^2 d\\epsilon$.\n3.  **Integration:**\n    $\\langle E \\rangle = \\int_0^\\infty \\epsilon \\langle n(\\epsilon) \\rangle g(\\epsilon) d\\epsilon = \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{\\epsilon}{e^{\\beta\\epsilon}-1} \\frac{8\\pi V}{(hc)^3} \\epsilon^2 d\\epsilon = \\frac{8\\pi V}{(hc)^3} \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{\\epsilon^3}{e^{\\beta\\epsilon}-1} d\\epsilon$.\n    Let $x = \\beta\\epsilon$, so $\\epsilon = x/\\beta$ and $d\\epsilon = dx/\\beta$.\n    $\\langle E \\rangle = \\frac{8\\pi V}{(hc)^3} (\\frac{1}{\\beta})^4 \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{x^3}{e^x-1} dx$.\n4.  **Final Value for Mean Energy:** The integral is a standard form related to the Riemann zeta function, equal to $\\Gamma(4)\\zeta(4) = 6 \\cdot (\\pi^4/90) = \\pi^4/15$. Substituting this and $\\beta = 1/(k_B T)$:\n    $\\langle E \\rangle = \\frac{8\\pi V}{(hc)^3} (k_B T)^4 \\frac{\\pi^4}{15} = \\left(\\frac{8\\pi^5 k_B^4}{15(hc)^3}\\right) V T^4$.\n    This is the Stefan-Boltzmann law for the total energy of black-body radiation.\n\n### Step 4: Calculating Equilibrium Entropy\n\nThe equilibrium entropy can be found by substituting the equilibrium distribution back into the entropy functional or by using a standard thermodynamic relation.\n\n1.  **Thermodynamic Relation:** For a grand canonical ensemble, $S = \\frac{\\langle E \\rangle - \\Omega_G}{T}$, where $\\Omega_G$ is the grand potential. For photons, the chemical potential is zero, so the grand potential equals the Helmholtz Free Energy, $\\Omega_G=F$. Thus, $S = (\\langle E \\rangle - F)/T$.\n2.  **Relation between Energy and Free Energy:** For an ultra-relativistic gas like photons in 3D, there's a simple relation between energy and pressure ($P = u/3$, where $u = \\langle E \\rangle/V$ is energy density), leading to the relation $F = -PV = -(\\langle E \\rangle / 3V) V = -\\frac{1}{3}\\langle E \\rangle$.\n3.  **Calculation of Entropy:**\n    $S = \\frac{\\langle E \\rangle - (-\\frac{1}{3}\\langle E \\rangle)}{T} = \\frac{\\frac{4}{3}\\langle E \\rangle}{T}$.\n4.  **Final Value for Entropy:** Substituting the result for $\\langle E \\rangle$:\n    $S = \\frac{4}{3T} \\left[ \\left(\\frac{8\\pi^5 k_B^4}{15(hc)^3}\\right) V T^4 \\right] = \\left(\\frac{32\\pi^5 k_B^4}{45(hc)^3}\\right) V T^3$.\n\nThe equilibrium values are functions of the system's volume $V$ and temperature $T$.\n\n***\n\nThe final equilibrium values are:\n\n**Mean Energy:**\n$ \\langle E \\rangle = \\left(\\frac{8\\pi^5 k_B^4}{15(hc)^3}\\right) V T^4 $\n\n**Entropy:**\n$ S = \\left(\\frac{32\\pi^5 k_B^4}{45(hc)^3}\\right) V T^3 $\n\n<<<**Mean Energy**: $\\langle E \\rangle = \\left(\\frac{8\\pi^5 k_B^4}{15(hc)^3}\\right) V T^4$. **Entropy**: $S = \\left(\\frac{32\\pi^5 k_B^4}{45(hc)^3}\\right) V T^3$.>>>"
