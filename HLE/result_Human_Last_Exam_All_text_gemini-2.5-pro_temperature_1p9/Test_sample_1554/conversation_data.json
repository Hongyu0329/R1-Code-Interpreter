    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct philosopher.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe core components of the question are:\n1.  **Philosophical School:** The Lviv-Warsaw School of Logic and Philosophy. This narrows down the potential candidates to a specific group of Polish thinkers from the early 20th century.\n2.  **Core Concept:** The notion of a \"hallmark.\" This is a general term for a distinguishing feature, sign, or indicator.\n3.  **Specific Distinction:** The decomposition of this hallmark into \"symptoms\" and \"signals.\" This is a key distinction in the field of semiotics (the theory of signs).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Key Terms (\"Symptom\" and \"Signal\")**\nIn semiotics and philosophy of language, this is a classic distinction:\n*   **Symptom:** A natural sign. There is a causal or natural link between the sign and what it signifies. The sign is not produced with the intent to communicate. For example, smoke is a symptom of fire; a rash is a symptom of a disease.\n*   **Signal:** A conventional or artificial sign. It is created intentionally to communicate a message according to a pre-established rule or code. For example, a red traffic light is a signal to stop; a person waving their hand is a signal for \"hello\" or \"goodbye.\"\n\n**Step 3: Survey Key Philosophers of the Lviv-Warsaw School and Their Specializations**\nWe must identify a philosopher from this school whose work prominently features this semiotic distinction.\n*   **Kazimierz Twardowski:** The school's founder. Focused on psychology, epistemology, and the theory of objects and contents. His work laid the foundation but did not elaborate on this specific semiotic split.\n*   **Jan Łukasiewicz, Alfred Tarski, Stanisław Leśniewski:** Primarily logicians. Their work was foundational for modern logic and semantics, but they did not focus on the symptom/signal distinction as a core part of their philosophy. Tarski's work on truth is related to meaning, but not in this specific way.\n*   **Tadeusz Kotarbiński:** Known for reism (or concretism) and praxeology (the theory of efficient action). While his work touches on communication as a form of action, the symptom/signal analysis is not his central contribution.\n*   **Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz:** A leading figure known for his work in logic, epistemology, and the philosophy of language. He developed a detailed semiotic theory and was deeply interested in the analysis of meaning and communication.\n\n**Step 4: Pinpoint the Correct Philosopher through a Careful Point Analysis**\n*   Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz's work is the most promising. In his writings, particularly in his influential book \"Pragmatic Logic,\" he provides a systematic analysis of different kinds of signs.\n*   **Careful Point 1:** Ajdukiewicz explicitly uses this distinction. He classifies signs (*znaki* in Polish, which can be translated as \"hallmarks\" or indicators) into these very categories.\n*   **Careful Point 2:** He refers to natural signs, such as a fever indicating an illness, as **symptoms** (Polish: *oznaki*).\n*   **Careful Point 3:** He refers to conventional, intentionally-produced signs, such as words in a language or traffic signs, as **signals** (Polish: *sygnały*).\n*   **Conclusion of Analysis:** This direct mapping between the question's terms (hallmark -> symptom/signal) and Ajdukiewicz's established semiotic theory makes him the correct answer. His work is a prime example of the analytical precision for which the Lviv-Warsaw School is known.\n\n**Final Answer Acquisition**\nThe step-by-step analysis consistently points to a single philosopher within the Lviv-Warsaw School who is known for this specific semiotic framework. The analysis of key terms and the surveying of major figures confirm that Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz is the one who decomposed the general notion of a sign (or hallmark) into natural symptoms and conventional signals.\n\n<<<Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz>>>"
