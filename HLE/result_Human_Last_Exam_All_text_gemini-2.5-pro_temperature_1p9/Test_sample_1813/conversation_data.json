    "An analysis of the user's question, breaking it down into step-by-step points.\n\n**1. Understand the Request**\nThe user wants to find the continued fraction associated with the generalized Markov number $m_{4/7}$.\nThis requires understanding how a rational number $p/q$ is associated with a specific quadratic irrational number, whose value in the Lagrange or Markoff spectrum is denoted by $m_{p/q}$. The question asks for the continued fraction expansion of this quadratic irrational number.\n\n**2. Key Concepts: Generalized Markov Numbers and Associated Continued Fractions**\nThe Markoff spectrum is a set of real numbers that arises in the theory of Diophantine approximation. The part of the spectrum below 3 is discrete and is associated with the integer solutions to the Markov equation $x^2+y^2+z^2=3xyz$.\nThe spectrum above 3 is more complex. For any rational number $p/q$, one can define a corresponding value in the spectrum, a \"generalized Markov number\" $m_{p/q}$. This value is defined via a specific quadratic irrational number, let's call it $\\alpha_{p/q}$, constructed from the continued fraction of $p/q$.\nThe standard construction for $\\alpha_{p/q}$ is as follows:\n- First, find the continued fraction of the rational number $p/q$. We need the representation that ends with an integer greater than 1. Let it be $p/q = [0; a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n]$, assuming $0 < p/q < 1$ and $a_n \\ge 2$.\n- The associated quadratic irrational number $\\alpha_{p/q}$ has a purely periodic continued fraction, where the period is a palindrome constructed from the coefficients $a_i$.\n- The period is given by the sequence $(a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_{n-1}, a_n, a_{n-1}, \\dots, a_2, a_1)$.\n- The resulting continued fraction is $\\alpha_{p/q} = [0; \\overline{a_1, \\dots, a_{n-1}, a_n, a_{n-1}, \\dots, a_1}]$.\n\n**3. Step-by-Step Computation for \\(m_{4/7}\\)**\n\n**Step 1: Find the continued fraction of \\(4/7\\).**\nWe use the Euclidean algorithm to find the coefficients.\n1.  $7 = 1 \\cdot 4 + 3$\n2.  $4 = 1 \\cdot 3 + 1$\n3.  $3 = 3 \\cdot 1 + 0$\n\nThe sequence of quotients gives the coefficients of the continued fraction. Since $0 < 4/7 < 1$, the first coefficient $a_0$ is 0.\n$4/7 = \\frac{1}{\\frac{7}{4}} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{3}{4}} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{1}{\\frac{4}{3}}} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{1}{3}}}$.\nSo, the continued fraction for $4/7$ is $[0; 1, 1, 3]$.\nWe need to check that this is the standard form for our construction. The coefficients are $a_1 = 1$, $a_2 = 1$, $a_3 = 3$. The last coefficient, $a_3 = 3$, is greater than 1, so this is the correct representation to use. (The alternative representation, $[0; 1, 1, 2, 1]$, ends in 1 and is not used for this standard construction).\n\n**Step 2: Construct the periodic part of the associated continued fraction.**\nFollowing the rule stated in point 2, for $p/q = [0; a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n]$, the period of $\\alpha_{p/q}$ is $(a_1, \\dots, a_{n-1}, a_n, a_{n-1}, \\dots, a_1)$.\nFor $4/7 = [0; 1, 1, 3]$, we have $n=3$, with coefficients:\n- $a_1 = 1$\n- $a_2 = 1$\n- $a_3 = 3$\n\nThe periodic block is $(a_1, a_2, a_3, a_2, a_1)$.\nSubstituting the values, we get the period: $(1, 1, 3, 1, 1)$.\n\n**Step 3: Write the final continued fraction.**\nThe continued fraction associated with the generalized Markov number $m_{4/7}$ is formed by placing this periodic block after the initial zero.\nThus, the continued fraction is $[0; \\overline{1, 1, 3, 1, 1}]$.\n\n**4. Summary of Careful Points**\n*   **Correct interpretation of the question:** The goal is not the numerical value of $m_{4/7}$ but the symbolic form of the associated continued fraction.\n*   **Standard continued fraction of the rational:** It's crucial to use the continued fraction of $p/q$ that ends in an integer greater than or equal to 2.\n*   **Correct construction rule:** The palindromic construction of the period for the associated quadratic irrational is a standard definition in this context. It's essential to apply this rule correctly.\n\nFinal Answer Formulation: The result of the step-by-step analysis is the continued fraction $[0; \\overline{1, 1, 3, 1, 1}]$.\n\nThe continued fraction associated with the generalized Markov number $m_{4/7}$ is computed as follows:\n1.  First, we find the continued fraction expansion of the rational number $4/7$. Using the Euclidean Algorithm:\n    $7 = 1 \\cdot 4 + 3$\n    $4 = 1 \\cdot 3 + 1$\n    $3 = 3 \\cdot 1 + 0$\n    This gives the continued fraction $4/7 = [0; 1, 1, 3]$. Let the coefficients be $a_1 = 1, a_2 = 1, a_3 = 3$.\n\n2.  For a rational number $p/q = [0; a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n]$ with $a_n \\geq 2$, the associated quadratic irrational number, which defines the generalized Markov number $m_{p/q}$, has a continued fraction of the form $[0; \\overline{P}]$, where the period $P$ is the palindrome constructed from the coefficients of $p/q$'s continued fraction. The period is the sequence $(a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_{n-1}, a_n, a_{n-1}, \\ldots, a_2, a_1)$.\n\n3.  For $4/7 = [0; 1, 1, 3]$, we have $n=3$ and the coefficients $a_1=1, a_2=1, a_3=3$. Applying the rule, the periodic part is the palindrome $(a_1, a_2, a_3, a_2, a_1)$.\n\n4.  Substituting the values of the coefficients, we obtain the periodic sequence $(1, 1, 3, 1, 1)$.\n\n5.  Therefore, the continued fraction associated with the generalized Markov number $m_{4/7}$ is $[0; \\overline{1, 1, 3, 1, 1}]$.\n\n<<<[0; \\overline{1, 1, 3, 1, 1}]>>>"
