    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of elements of the reflection group of type H3 that have a regular eigenvector with a corresponding eigenvalue of order 10.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Question**\nThe question asks for the number of elements `g` in the reflection group `W` of type H3 that satisfy two specific conditions:\n*   **Condition 1:** The element `g` must have a *regular eigenvector*.\n*   **Condition 2:** The eigenvalue `λ` corresponding to that regular eigenvector must have an *order of 10*.\n\n**2. Analyze Condition 1: Regular Eigenvector**\n*   A *regular vector* is a vector that does not lie in any of the reflecting hyperplanes of the group `W`.\n*   A fundamental theorem by T.A. Springer states that an element `g` in an irreducible finite Coxeter group has a regular eigenvector if and only if `g` is a *regular element*.\n*   A *regular element* is an element that is not contained in any proper parabolic subgroup of `W`.\n*   Therefore, the first condition restricts our search to the set of regular elements within the H3 group.\n\n**3. Analyze Condition 2: Eigenvalue of Order 10**\n*   The eigenvalue `λ` has order 10. This means `λ^10 = 1` and `λ^k ≠ 1` for any integer `1 ≤ k < 10`. Such a `λ` is known as a primitive 10th root of unity.\n*   If `g` is an element of a finite group and `λ` is one of its eigenvalues, then the order of the element `g` must be a multiple of the order of `λ`.\n*   In this case, since `λ` has order 10, the order of `g` must be a multiple of 10.\n\n**4. Combine the Conditions and Properties of H3**\n*   From Step 2, we are looking for *regular elements*.\n*   From Step 3, the order of these elements must be a multiple of 10.\n*   A key property of regular elements in an irreducible finite Coxeter group is that their order must divide the *Coxeter number*, denoted by *h*.\n*   The problem states that for the group of type H3, the Coxeter number is *h = 10*.\n\n**5. Determine the Exact Order of the Elements**\n*   We have two constraints on the order of `g`:\n    1.  The order of `g` is a multiple of 10.\n    2.  The order of `g` divides 10.\n*   The only integer that satisfies both conditions is 10. Therefore, we are looking for regular elements `g` of order exactly 10.\n\n**6. Reformulate the Problem**\nThe original question is now equivalent to a more direct one: **\"How many regular elements of order 10 are there in the reflection group of type H3?\"**\n\n**7. Count the Regular Elements of Order *h***\nTo count these elements, we can use the concept of *regular cyclic subgroups*.\n*   The regular elements of order *h* in `W` are precisely the generators of the regular cyclic subgroups of order *h*.\n*   The number of regular cyclic subgroups of order *h* in an irreducible Coxeter group `W` can be calculated with the formula:\n    `Number of subgroups = |W| / h`\n    where `|W|` is the order (size) of the group and `h` is the Coxeter number.\n*   The H3 group is the symmetry group of the regular icosahedron and dodecahedron. Its order is `|H3| = 120`.\n*   The Coxeter number is `h = 10`.\n*   Plugging in the values: `Number of regular cyclic subgroups = 120 / 10 = 12`.\n\n**8. Count the Generators for Each Subgroup**\n*   Each of these 12 subgroups is a cyclic group of order 10, isomorphic to $C_{10}$.\n*   The number of generators in a cyclic group of order `n` is given by Euler's totient function, `φ(n)`.\n*   We need to find the number of generators for a $C_{10}$ group, which is `φ(10)`.\n*   Calculating Euler's totient function: `φ(10) = φ(2) * φ(5) = (2-1) * (5-1) = 1 * 4 = 4`.\n*   This means each of the 12 regular cyclic subgroups has 4 generators. These generators are precisely the regular elements of order 10.\n\n**9. Calculate the Final Answer**\nThe total number of regular elements of order 10 is the number of regular cyclic subgroups multiplied by the number of generators per subgroup.\n*   Total Number = (Number of subgroups) × (Number of generators per subgroup)\n*   Total Number = 12 × 4 = 48.\n\nThe 48 elements found are all the regular elements of order 10. As shown, any such element necessarily has regular eigenvectors with eigenvalues of order 10. Conversely, any element satisfying the problem's conditions must be one of these 48 elements.\n\n<<<48>>>"
