The primary reason a functional MRI coil may not show a resonance when probed with a magnetic loop is the presence of a **transmit/receive (T/R) detuning circuit**. This is a safety feature designed to protect the patient, the coil, and the preamplifier from the high power of the scanner's transmit RF pulse.

This circuit, typically using PIN diodes, actively de-tunes the coil by shorting its capacitor or shifting its resonant frequency. The circuit is controlled by a DC bias voltage from the scanner. When the coil is unplugged and sitting on a bench, it does not receive this bias. For safety, the circuit is designed to **fail-safe into the detuned state**. As a result, the coil is intentionally non-resonant, and your VNA test will correctly show no resonance peak. The coil only becomes resonant when connected to the scanner and the system provides the proper bias for "receive" mode.

Other significant possibilities include:
1.  **Poor Coupling/Field Orthogonality:** You may be placing the probe in a location or orientation where its magnetic field does not effectively link with the MRI coil element's sensitive axis, resulting in near-zero signal transfer.
2.  **Complex Decoupling Networks:** In multi-element array coils, networks designed to isolate elements from each other might also inadvertently isolate an element from your external probe.
