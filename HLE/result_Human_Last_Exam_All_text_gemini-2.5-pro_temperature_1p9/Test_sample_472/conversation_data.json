    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the scansion for the line:\n\"et tibi bene esse soli quom sibi sit male\"\n\nThe meter is an Iambic Senarius, which consists of six iambic feet (S L). In Roman comedy, this meter is very flexible and allows for substitutions such as spondees (L L), tribrachs (S S S), anapests (S S L), and dactyls (L S S). Word division does not need to align with foot division.\n\n**Careful Points & Syllable Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Vowel Quantities:** We must determine if each vowel is naturally long or short, and if a syllable becomes long \"by position\" (a vowel followed by two consonants or a double consonant like 'x' or 'z').\n    *   `et`: Short 'e'. Syllable is short (S).\n    *   `tibi`: Both 'i's are short. Two short syllables (S S).\n    *   `bene`: Both 'e's are short. Two short syllables (S S).\n    *   `esse`: The first syllable `es-` has a short 'e' but is followed by `ss`, making it long by position. The second syllable `-se` has a short 'e' and is short. (L S).\n    *   `soli`: The dative singular of `solus`. Both the `o` and the final `i` are long. (L L).\n    *   `quom`: Archaic form of `cum`. The vowel `o` is long. (L).\n    *   `sibi`: Both 'i's are short. (S S).\n    *   `sit`: The 'i' is short. (S).\n    *   `male`: The 'a' is short. The final `-e` is the last syllable of the line and is thus *syllaba anceps* (long or short), which is treated as long for metrical purposes. (S L).\n\n2.  **Foot Division:** We group the syllables into six feet, starting from the end of the line which is typically more regular.\n\n**Step-by-Step Scansion:**\n\n*   **Foot 6:** The last two syllables are `ma le`. Their quantities are S L. This is a perfect **iamb**.\n    `... | ma le` (S L)\n\n*   **Foot 5:** Before `male`, we have the syllables `si bi sit`. Their quantities are S S S. This forms a **tribrach**, which is a common substitution for an iamb in this meter.\n    `... | si bi sit | ma le` (S S S | S L)\n\n*   **Foot 4:** Before this, we have `-li quom`. The syllable `-li` comes from `soli` (L L), so `-li` is long (L). The syllable `quom` is also long (L). This creates the foot L L, a **spondee**, which is another valid substitution.\n    `... | li quom | si bi sit | ma le` (L L | S S S | S L)\n\n*   **Foot 3:** This leaves `se so-` for the third foot. `-se` is the second syllable of `esse` (L S), so it is short (S). `so-` is the first syllable of `soli` (L L), so it is long (L). The quantities S L form a perfect **iamb**.\n    `... | se so | li quom | si bi sit | ma le` (S L | L L | S S S | S L)\n\n*   **Foot 2:** The syllables before this are `be ne es-`. `-ne` is from `bene` (S S), so it's short (S). `es-` is the first syllable of `esse` (L S), so it's long (L). This gives us `be ne es-` with quantities S S L. This forms an **anapest**, another allowed substitution.\n    `... | be ne es | se so | li quom | si bi sit | ma le` (S S L | S L | L L | S S S | S L)\n\n*   **Foot 1:** This leaves the first three syllables of the line: `et ti bi`. Their quantities are S S S. This forms a **tribrach**.\n    `et ti bi | be ne es | se so | li quom | si bi sit | ma le` (S S S | S S L | S L | L L | S S S | S L)\n\n**Final Scansion:**\n\n*   **Foot 1:** `et tibi` (S S S) - Tribrach\n*   **Foot 2:** `bene es-` (S S L) - Anapest\n*   **Foot 3:** `-se so-` (S L) - Iamb\n*   **Foot 4:** `-li quom` (L L) - Spondee\n*   **Foot 5:** `sibi sit` (S S S) - Tribrach\n*   **Foot 6:** `male` (S L) - Iamb\n\nThe complete metrical pattern is therefore: S S S S S L S L L L S S S S L\n\n<<<S S S S S L S L L L S S S S L>>>"
