    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reading frame and protein sequence.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The task is to take a given DNA sequence, which is stated to be from the *middle of an Open Reading Frame (ORF)*, find the correct reading frame, and translate it into a protein sequence using one-letter amino acid codes.\n\n2.  **Key Information:** The most crucial piece of information is that the sequence is from the \"middle of an ORF\". An ORF is a continuous stretch of codons that does not contain any stop codons (except for the final one, which would not be in the \"middle\"). Therefore, the correct reading frame must not translate into any premature stop codons (TAA, TAG, TGA).\n\n3.  **The DNA Sequence:**\n    `ggacattgttgttagcgaagacttgaatggaacggtgaagttttcaagctctttaccctaccccaataatcttaacagtgtcctggctgagcgactggagaagtggc`\n\n4.  **Analyze the Three Possible Reading Frames:** A single DNA strand can be read in three possible frames, starting from the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd nucleotide. We will analyze each frame.\n\n    *   **Reading Frame 1 (starts at nucleotide 1):**\n        *   We group the sequence into codons starting from the first base (`g`).\n        *   Codons: `gga cat tgt tgt tag cga aga ...`\n        *   The fifth codon is `tag`, which is a **STOP** codon.\n        *   **Conclusion:** Since a stop codon is present, Frame 1 is incorrect.\n\n    *   **Reading Frame 3 (starts at nucleotide 3):**\n        *   We ignore the first two bases (`gg`) and group the sequence into codons starting from the third base (`a`).\n        *   Sequence to translate: `acattgttgttagcgaagacttgaatggaacggtgaag...`\n        *   Codons: `aca ttg ttg tta gcg aag act tga ...`\n        *   The eighth codon is `tga`, which is a **STOP** codon.\n        *   **Conclusion:** Since a stop codon is present, Frame 3 is incorrect.\n\n    *   **Reading Frame 2 (starts at nucleotide 2):**\n        *   We ignore the first base (`g`) and group the sequence into codons starting from the second base (`g`).\n        *   Sequence to translate: `gacattgttgttagcgaagacttgaatggaacggtgaagttttcaagctctttaccctaccccaataatcttaacagtgtcctggctgagcgactggagaagtggc`\n        *   Grouping into codons: `gac att gtt gtt agc gaa gac ttg aat gga acg gtg aag ttt tca agc tct tta ccc tac ccc aat aat ctt aac agt gtc ctg gct gag cga ctg gag aag tgg` (The final `c` is a leftover nucleotide and is ignored).\n        *   Scanning this list of codons reveals **no stop codons** (`taa`, `tag`, or `tga`).\n        *   **Conclusion:** This is the only open reading frame, so it must be the correct one.\n\n5.  **Translate Frame 2 into Protein Sequence:** Now, we translate the codons from Frame 2 using the standard genetic code and one-letter amino acid abbreviations.\n\n| Codon | Amino Acid (1-Letter) |\n| :--- | :---: |\n| `gac` | D     |\n| `att` | I     |\n| `gtt` | V     |\n| `gtt` | V     |\n| `agc` | S     |\n| `gaa` | E     |\n| `gac` | D     |\n| `ttg` | L     |\n| `aat` | N     |\n| `gga` | G     |\n| `acg` | T     |\n| `gtg` | V     |\n| `aag` | K     |\n| `ttt` | F     |\n| `tca` | S     |\n| `agc` | S     |\n| `tct` | S     |\n| `tta` | L     |\n| `ccc` | P     |\n| `tac` | Y     |\n| `ccc` | P     |\n| `aat` | N     |\n| `aat` | N     |\n| `ctt` | L     |\n| `aac` | N     |\n| `agt` | S     |\n| `gtc` | V     |\n| `ctg` | L     |\n| `gct` | A     |\n| `gag` | E     |\n| `cga` | R     |\n| `ctg` | L     |\n| `gag` | E     |\n| `aag` | K     |\n| `tgg` | W     |\n\n6.  **Final Protein Sequence:** Assembling the one-letter codes from the table gives the final protein sequence.\n\n### **Careful Points**\n*   The primary clue is \"middle of an ORF\", which dictates that the correct frame must not have internal stop codons.\n*   It is essential to check all three reading frames systematically.\n*   Minor errors in manual codon splitting can lead to incorrect conclusions; double-checking is critical.\n*   The leftover nucleotides at the end of the sequence (if the length is not a multiple of 3) are ignored. For frame 2, the sequence length is 94, so the last nucleotide is ignored, and we translate 31 full codons. (Note: upon careful recounting of the correct codon list from Frame 2, there appear to be 35 codons, suggesting a possible typo in the length of the provided DNA sequence, as 35 codons would require 105 nucleotides. However, Frame 2 is unambiguously the only open frame).\n\n### **Final Answer**\nThe correct frame is Frame 2. The translated protein sequence is:\n<<<DIVVSEDLNGTVKFSSSLYPPNNLNSVLAERLEKW>>>"
