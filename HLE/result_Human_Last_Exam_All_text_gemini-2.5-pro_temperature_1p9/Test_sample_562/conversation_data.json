    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the radical of the character 謄.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Character:** The Japanese character in question is 謄. We first need to break it down into its components. The character has a clear left-right structure.\n    *   The left part is: 言\n    *   The right part is: 朕\n\n2.  **Identify the Radical (Bushu):** In kanji characters with a left-right structure, the left-side component is very often the radical, which is called a *hen* (偏). The radical is the part of the character used for classification in dictionaries and often hints at the character's general meaning.\n    *   The left component, 言, means \"word\" or \"to say\".\n    *   The character 謄 means \"to copy\" or \"to transcribe\" (e.g., in the word 謄写 *tōsha*, \"transcription/copying\"). The meaning is related to language and words.\n    *   Therefore, 言 is the radical for this character.\n\n3.  **Find the Name of the Radical:** We need to find the specific Japanese name for the radical 言 when it appears on the left side of a character.\n    *   The radical is 言. The on'yomi (Sino-Japanese reading) of 言 is *gon* (or *gen*).\n    *   The position is on the left, which is called a *hen* (偏).\n    *   When combined, 言偏 is read as *gonben* (ごんべん). The *hen* becomes voiced to *ben* due to a phonetic change called *rendaku*.\n\n4.  **Transcribe the Name into Hepburn:** The final step is to write the Japanese name \"ごんべん\" using Hepburn romanization.\n    *   ご -> go\n    *   ん -> n\n    *   べ -> be\n    *   ん -> n\n    *   The Hepburn transcription is \"Gonben\".\n\n**Careful points:**\n\n*   It is crucial to correctly identify the components of the character. Mistaking the left part for another radical (like 月) would lead to an incorrect answer.\n*   One must know the specific names for radicals based on their form and position. The radical 言 has different names depending on its position (e.g., when it is at the bottom, it's called *gen*). When on the left, it is *gonben*.\n*   Be aware of phonetic changes like *rendaku* (e.g., *hen* -> *ben*).\n*   The final answer must be in Hepburn transcription as requested.\n\n<<<Gonben>>>"
