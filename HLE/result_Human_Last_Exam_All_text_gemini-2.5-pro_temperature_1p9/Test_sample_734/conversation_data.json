    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe core of the question is to identify a specific Christian theologian who meets several criteria:\n1.  **Is a Christian theologian.**\n2.  Was the **first** to do so in an influential way.\n3.  Developed **specialized terminology** (i.e., not just a general discussion, but a specific conceptual framework with its own terms).\n4.  This terminology can describe **changes in the laws of nature**.\n5.  This framework is applicable to two distinct events:\n    a. The **virgin birth of Jesus** (a specific miracle).\n    b. The potential **alterations in natural laws at the Fall** (a systemic, epochal change).\n\n**Step 2: Initial Consideration of Candidates**\n*   **Early Church Fathers (pre-Augustine):** Figures like Irenaeus or Athanasius affirmed these doctrines but didn't typically create a philosophical-theological system with specialized terminology to explain the *mechanics* of how miracles relate to natural law. Their focus was more on the salvific meaning of the events.\n*   **Medieval Scholastics (e.g., Aquinas, Scotus):** These theologians are known for creating highly systematic frameworks. Thomas Aquinas developed the distinction between Primary and Secondary Causality, where a miracle is God (the Primary Cause) acting directly without the usual Secondary Causes (natural laws). Duns Scotus and others famously used the distinction between God's ordained power (*potentia ordinata*) and his absolute power (*potentia absoluta*). This terminology is perfectly suited to the question, but these theologians came centuries after the key candidate.\n*   **The Reformers (e.g., Luther, Calvin):** While building on earlier tradition, their primary focus was not on developing new metaphysical language for miracles, and they were often critical of what they saw as scholastic speculation.\n\n**Step 3: Focus on Augustine of Hippo (354-430 AD)**\nAugustine emerges as the strongest and earliest candidate. He was deeply concerned with the relationship between God's providence, creation, and miracles. To reconcile the Genesis account of a six-day creation with the ongoing appearance of new things and miracles, he developed a unique and influential system.\n\n**Step 4: Identify Augustine's Specialized Terminology**\nThe key term Augustine developed is **\"seminal reasons\"** (in Latin, ***rationes seminales*** or ***rationes causales***). He adapted this idea from Stoic philosophy and integrated it into Christian theology.\n\n*   **Concept:** Augustine proposed that in the initial act of creation, God embedded the potential for everything that would ever exist into the fabric of the universe. These potentials are the \"seminal reasons\"—invisible, seed-like principles or causal powers.\n*   **Normal \"Laws of Nature\":** The ordinary, predictable course of the world is simply the gradual, natural unfolding of these seminal reasons over time, like a plant growing from a seed.\n*   **How it addresses the question:** This framework provides a way to talk about events outside the normal course of nature without suggesting that God is chaotically violating His own laws.\n\n**Step 5: Apply the Terminology to the Specific Cases**\n\n1.  **The Virgin Birth:** In Augustine's system, the virgin birth is not a violation of nature as God created it. Instead, it is an instance where God directly and miraculously activates a unique seminal reason that He had placed in creation from the very beginning. This \"reason\" was not part of the ordinary process of reproduction but was a potential within creation that only God could bring forth. Thus, the event is above the *course* of nature, but not *against* the ultimate design of nature.\n\n2.  **Alterations at the Fall:** Augustine's framework also elegantly explains the changes in nature post-Fall. He taught that in their original state, Adam and Eve were endowed with supernatural graces that held the negative potentials of creation (like decay, disease, and mortality) in check. The seminal reasons for these negative outcomes existed but were suppressed. With the Fall, humanity lost this grace. As a result, these dormant seminal reasons for mortality and corruption were \"unleashed\" and began to unfold, establishing a new, fallen \"natural order\" for humanity and the world. This is a perfect example of a systemic \"change in the laws of nature.\"\n\n**Step 6: Conclusion**\nAugustine was the first major theologian to create a sophisticated and specialized terminology—the doctrine of *rationes seminales*—that could systematically account for both singular miracles like the virgin birth and fundamental shifts in the natural order like the consequences of the Fall. He provided a way to understand these events as part of God's overarching creative plan rather than as arbitrary interruptions of it. While later theologians like Aquinas and Scotus developed different terminologies, Augustine’s was the foundational development in Christian thought for this specific problem.\n\n<<<Augustine of Hippo>>>"
