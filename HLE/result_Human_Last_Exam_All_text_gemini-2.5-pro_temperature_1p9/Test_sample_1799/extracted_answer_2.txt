No, it is not true. The 2nd postulate is not superfluous and cannot be deduced from the first. The first postulate, when applied to the conflicting laws of Newtonian mechanics and Maxwell's equations, leads to a contradiction. The second postulate is the independent axiom required to resolve this conflict by establishing that there is a finite, invariant speed, which in turn forces a revision of Newtonian mechanics and the underlying assumptions about space and time.
