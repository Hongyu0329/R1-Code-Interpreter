    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Analyzing and Interpreting the Question**\n\nThe question asks for \"the minimum number of vertices in a family of bipartite graphs covering all the edges of the complete graph \\( K_n \\) where n = 35\".\n\nThe phrase \"number of vertices in a family of graphs\" is ambiguous. Let's analyze the possible interpretations:\n\n1.  **Literal Interpretation 1: Total unique vertices.** Let the family of bipartite graphs be \\( \\mathcal{B} = \\{B_1, B_2, \\dots, B_k\\} \\). Let the vertex set of graph \\(B_i\\) be \\(V(B_i)\\). This interpretation asks for the minimum size of the union of all vertex sets, \\( |\\bigcup_{i=1}^k V(B_i)| \\). For this family to cover the edges of \\(K_{35}\\), which is defined on 35 vertices, the combined vertex set of the family must contain all 35 vertices of \\(K_{35}\\). Therefore, the minimum size is at least 35. It is possible to construct the covering graphs using only these 35 vertices, so the minimum would be exactly 35. This answer is trivial and likely not the intended problem, given the request for a detailed analysis.\n\n2.  **Literal Interpretation 2: Sum of vertices.** This would ask for the minimum of \\( \\sum_{i=1}^k |V(B_i)| \\). This value is not a standard graph parameter and would heavily depend on the specific construction of the bipartite graphs, making it an ill-posed problem.\n\n3.  **Typo Interpretation: Minimum number of graphs.** It is highly probable that \"vertices\" is a typo for \"graphs\". The question would then be: \"What is the minimum number of bipartite graphs in a family that covers all the edges of the complete graph \\( K_{35} \\)?\". This is a classic and well-understood problem in combinatorial graph theory. It is non-trivial and fits the context of such a question.\n\nWe will proceed with the third interpretation as it is the most standard and meaningful one.\n\n**Careful Point 1:** The most crucial step is interpreting the ambiguous question. Assuming \"vertices\" is a typo for \"graphs\" leads to a well-known mathematical problem.\n\n**Step 2: Formalizing the Interpreted Problem**\n\nThe problem is to find the minimum integer \\(k\\) (the number of bipartite graphs) such that the edge set of the complete graph \\(K_{35}\\) can be expressed as the union of the edge sets of \\(k\\) bipartite graphs, \\(B_1, \\dots, B_k\\). The vertices of these bipartite graphs are the same 35 vertices of \\(K_{35}\\).\n\nIn mathematical notation: Find the minimum \\(k\\) such that \\(E(K_{35}) = \\bigcup_{i=1}^k E(B_i)\\), where each \\(B_i\\) is a bipartite graph.\n\n**Careful Point 2:** It is important to distinguish between \"covering\" and \"partitioning\" the edges.\n*   **Covering:** An edge of \\(K_n\\) must appear in *at least one* bipartite graph. \\(E(K_n) = \\bigcup E(B_i)\\).\n*   **Partitioning:** An edge of \\(K_n\\) must appear in *exactly one* bipartite graph. \\(E(K_n) = \\bigsqcup E(B_i)\\) (a disjoint union).\nThe question specifies \"covering\". For partitioning \\(K_n\\) with bipartite graphs, the answer is \\(n-1\\). For covering, the answer is different.\n\n**Step 3: Establishing a Lower Bound**\n\nLet \\(k\\) be the minimum number of bipartite graphs needed to cover \\(K_n\\). Let the vertex set of \\(K_n\\) be \\(V\\), with \\(|V| = n = 35\\).\nFor each bipartite graph \\(B_i\\) in the covering family, its vertex set \\(V\\) can be split into two disjoint sets (a bipartition) \\(X_i\\) and \\(Y_i\\) such that all edges in \\(B_i\\) connect a vertex in \\(X_i\\) to a vertex in \\(Y_i\\).\n\nWe can assign a \"signature\" to each vertex \\(v \\in V\\). This signature will be a binary vector \\(s(v)\\) of length \\(k\\). The \\(i\\)-th bit of the vector \\(s(v)\\) is 0 if \\(v \\in X_i\\) and 1 if \\(v \\in Y_i\\).\n\nNow, consider any two distinct vertices, \\(u\\) and \\(v\\). If they were to have the same signature vector, \\(s(u) = s(v)\\), it would mean that for every \\(i\\) from 1 to \\(k\\), both \\(u\\) and \\(v\\) belong to the same partition set (both in \\(X_i\\) or both in \\(Y_i\\)). By the definition of a bipartite graph, there would be no edge between \\(u\\) and \\(v\\) in any of the graphs \\(B_i\\). This would mean the edge \\((u,v)\\) of \\(K_n\\) is not covered.\n\nSince the family must cover all edges of \\(K_n\\), every pair of distinct vertices must be connected in at least one \\(B_i\\). Therefore, every pair of distinct vertices must have different signature vectors.\nThis means we need \\(n\\) unique signature vectors for the \\(n\\) vertices. The total number of available unique binary vectors of length \\(k\\) is \\(2^k\\).\nThus, it must hold that \\(n \\le 2^k\\).\n\nFor our case, \\(n = 35\\). We must have \\(35 \\le 2^k\\).\n*   \\(2^5 = 32\\) (not enough)\n*   \\(2^6 = 64\\) (sufficient)\nSo, we must have \\(k \\ge 6\\). The lower bound for the number of bipartite graphs is 6. This can be expressed as \\(k \\ge \\lceil \\log_2 n \\rceil\\).\n\n**Step 4: Proving the Lower Bound is Achievable (Upper Bound)**\n\nWe now show that \\(k = \\lceil \\log_2 n \\rceil\\) graphs are sufficient by providing a construction. For \\(n = 35\\), we need to show that \\(k = 6\\) graphs are enough.\n\n1.  Let the set of 35 vertices be \\(V\\).\n2.  Assign a unique binary label \\(l(v)\\) of length 6 to each vertex \\(v \\in V\\). This is possible since there are \\(2^6 = 64\\) unique labels available.\n3.  For each bit position \\(i \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, 6\\}\\), we define a bipartite graph \\(B_i\\). The bipartition \\((X_i, Y_i)\\) of \\(V\\) is defined as follows:\n    *   \\(X_i = \\{v \\in V \\mid \\text{the } i\\text{-th bit of } l(v) \\text{ is } 0\\}\\)\n    *   \\(Y_i = \\{v \\in V \\mid \\text{the } i\\text{-th bit of } l(v) \\text{ is } 1\\}\\)\n4.  Let the graph \\(B_i\\) be the **complete** bipartite graph with parts \\(X_i\\) and \\(Y_i\\). This means \\(B_i\\) contains all possible edges between a vertex in \\(X_i\\) and a vertex in \\(Y_i\\).\n5.  Consider any two distinct vertices \\(u,v \\in V\\). Since their labels \\(l(u)\\) and \\(l(v)\\) are unique, the binary vectors must differ in at least one bit position. Let's say they differ at position \\(m\\). This means that one vertex belongs to \\(X_m\\) and the other to \\(Y_m\\).\n6.  By our construction of \\(B_m\\), the edge \\((u,v)\\) is present in \\(B_m\\).\n7.  Since this holds for any pair of distinct vertices, the union of the edge sets of \\(B_1, B_2, \\dots, B_6\\) covers all edges of \\(K_{35}\\).\n\nThis construction proves that 6 bipartite graphs are sufficient.\n\n**Careful Point 3:** The construction uses complete bipartite graphs, which is a stronger condition than just bipartite. If it's possible with complete bipartite graphs, it is certainly possible with general bipartite graphs.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nBy combining the lower bound from Step 3 and the upper bound from Step 4, we conclude that the minimum number of bipartite graphs required to cover all the edges of \\(K_{35}\\) is exactly 6.\n\nAssuming the most plausible interpretation of the question, the final answer is 6.\n\n<<<6>>>"
