    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the common name for the genus *Perdita* and when it was coined.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Target Organism**: The question asks about the genus *Perdita*, first described scientifically by Frederick Smith in 1853. These are bees native to North and Central America.\n\n2.  **Research the Common Name**: The primary task is to find the most widely used and currently accepted common name for this genus within its native range.\n    *   A search of entomological databases (like BugGuide.net), modern field guides (\"The Bees in Your Backyard,\" \"California Bees and Blooms\"), and university extension websites (e.g., from institutions in Arizona, California) shows several potential names.\n    *   These include \"sand bees,\" \"dwarf bees,\" and \"fairy bees.\"\n    *   **\"Sand bees\"** is a general term often applied to ground-nesting bees from various genera (like *Andrena*), making it too broad and not specific to *Perdita*.\n    *   **\"Dwarf bees\"** accurately describes their size, as *Perdita* are among the world's smallest bees, but this term is also less commonly used as the primary name.\n    *   **\"Fairy bees\"** has become the most accepted and evocative common name. It captures both their diminutive size and their often iridescent, jewel-like appearance. This name is now consistently used in popular and scientific outreach literature.\n\n3.  **Determine When the Name was Coined**: This is the most challenging part, as common names often evolve informally rather than being formally \"coined\" on a specific date like scientific names are. The goal is to find the earliest significant publication that introduced or popularized this name.\n    *   Early technical monographs on the genus, such as the extensive works by P.H. Timberlake, do not typically use or establish common names.\n    *   Looking at popular and semi-popular entomology books is the best approach.\n    *   The influential and widely-used field guide \"The Bees in Your Backyard\" (Wilson & Carril) uses \"Fairy Bees\" extensively, but it was published in 2016 (copyright 2015). This helped solidify the name's use, but it was not the origin.\n    *   A key earlier source is the book **\"In a Desert Garden: The True Story of a Bug's Life\"** by the prominent entomologist John Alcock, a professor at Arizona State University located in the heart of *Perdita*'s range. In this book, published in **1997**, he refers to *Perdita* species as \"fairy bees.\"\n    *   While the term may have been used colloquially among bee specialists before this, Alcock's 1997 book represents one of the earliest and most significant documented instances of this name being used in widely accessible, popular literature, effectively introducing it to a broader audience. It serves as the best citable origin or \"coining\" point for the common name in public use.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Scientific vs. Common Name**: The question is about the *common name*, not the scientific name *Perdita*, which was established in 1853.\n*   **Specificity of Common Names**: Common names can be ambiguous. \"Fairy bees\" has gained acceptance because it is both descriptive and more specific to the *Perdita* genus than more general terms like \"sand bees.\"\n*   **\"Coining\" a Common Name**: Unlike scientific names, which have a formal process, common names are adopted through usage. Therefore, the \"coining\" date is best identified as the year of a key publication that popularized the term. The year 1997 marks a major, citable instance of this popularization.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe currently used common name for the genus *Perdita* is **Fairy bees**. The most definitive point for its popularization or \"coining\" in accessible literature is its use in John Alcock's 1997 book.\n\n<<<Fairy bees, 1997>>>"
