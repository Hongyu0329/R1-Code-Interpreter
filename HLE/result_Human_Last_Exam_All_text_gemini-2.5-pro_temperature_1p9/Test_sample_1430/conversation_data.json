    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the smallest and largest possible rank of the Neron-Severi group of X, where X is the 15th symmetric power of a genus 3 Riemann surface C.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the object of study\nWe are given a compact Riemann surface C of genus $g=3$.\n$X$ is the 15th symmetric power of C, denoted as $X = C^{(15)}$.\nThe Neron-Severi group, $NS(X)$, is the group of divisors on X modulo algebraic equivalence. Its rank is called the Picard number, $\\rho(X)$.\nOur goal is to find the minimum and maximum possible values of $\\rho(X)$ as C varies over all genus 3 Riemann surfaces.\n\n### Step 2: Relate the Neron-Severi rank to cohomology\nThe Neron-Severi group $NS(X)$ is a subgroup of the second cohomology group $H^2(X, \\mathbb{Z})$. The rank $\\rho(X)$ is the dimension of the rational vector space $NS(X) \\otimes \\mathbb{Q}$.\nBy the Lefschetz theorem on (1,1)-classes, the classes of algebraic cycles correspond to Hodge classes of type (1,1). That is, $NS(X) \\otimes \\mathbb{Q} = H^{1,1}(X) \\cap H^2(X, \\mathbb{Q})$.\nSo, $\\rho(X)$ is the dimension of the space of rational Hodge classes of type (1,1).\nA fundamental inequality is $\\rho(X) \\le h^{1,1}(X)$, where $h^{1,1}(X) = \\dim_{\\mathbb{C}} H^{1,1}(X)$.\n\n### Step 3: Compute the Hodge numbers of X = C^(15)\nFor a smooth projective curve C of genus g, the cohomology of its d-th symmetric power $C^{(d)}$ can be calculated using Macdonald's formula. For $d \\ge g$, the cohomology groups stabilize. Here, $d=15$ and $g=3$, so we are in the stable range.\n\nThe second Betti number of $X = C^{(d)}$ is given by:\n$b_2(X) = b_2(C) + \\binom{b_1(C)}{2}$\nSince $C$ is a genus 3 curve, we have $b_1(C) = 2g = 6$ and $b_2(C) = 1$.\nSo, $b_2(X) = 1 + \\binom{6}{2} = 1 + \\frac{6 \\times 5}{2} = 1 + 15 = 16$.\n\nThe Hodge numbers $h^{p,q}(X) = \\dim H^{p,q}(X)$ are derived from the Hodge structure of C. For $X=C^{(d)}$ with $d \\ge p$, we have:\n$h^{p,0}(X) = \\binom{g}{p}$\nFor our case, $g=3$, we are interested in $H^2(X)$, so we compute $h^{2,0}(X)$:\n$h^{2,0}(X) = \\binom{3}{2} = 3$.\nBy Serre duality (or complex conjugation), $h^{0,2}(X) = h^{2,0}(X) = 3$.\n\nThe Hodge number $h^{1,1}(X)$ can be found using the Betti number:\n$b_2(X) = h^{2,0}(X) + h^{1,1}(X) + h^{0,2}(X)$\n$16 = 3 + h^{1,1}(X) + 3$\n$h^{1,1}(X) = 16 - 6 = 10$.\nThis gives us the upper bound $\\rho(X) \\le 10$.\n\n### Step 4: Decompose the cohomology and relate it to the Jacobian of C\nThe second cohomology group of $X = C^{(d)}$ has a natural decomposition:\n$H^2(X, \\mathbb{Q}) \\cong H^2(C, \\mathbb{Q}) \\oplus \\Lambda^2 H^1(C, \\mathbb{Q})$\nLet $J(C)$ be the Jacobian of C, which is a principally polarized abelian variety of dimension $g=3$. There is a canonical isomorphism $H^1(C, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong H^1(J(C), \\mathbb{Z})$, which implies $\\Lambda^2 H^1(C, \\mathbb{Q}) \\cong \\Lambda^2 H^1(J(C), \\mathbb{Q}) \\cong H^2(J(C), \\mathbb{Q})$.\nSo, $H^2(X, \\mathbb{Q}) \\cong H^2(C, \\mathbb{Q}) \\oplus H^2(J(C), \\mathbb{Q})$.\n\nThis decomposition respects the Hodge structure.\n- The class from $H^2(C, \\mathbb{Q})$ is of type (1,1). It corresponds to an algebraic class on X (for instance, the class of the divisor $C^{(14)} + p_0$ for a fixed point $p_0 \\in C$). Let's call its generator L.\n- The decomposition of $H^2(J(C), \\mathbb{C})$ gives the rest of the Hodge structure of $H^2(X, \\mathbb{C})$.\n\nThe space of rational (1,1)-classes on X therefore decomposes as:\n$H^{1,1}(X, \\mathbb{Q}) \\cong (\\mathbb{Q} \\cdot L) \\oplus (H^{1,1}(J(C), \\mathbb{Q}))$.\nThe dimension of this space is $\\rho(X)$. The dimension of $H^{1,1}(J(C), \\mathbb{Q})$ is $\\rho(J(C))$.\nThus, we arrive at the crucial relationship:\n$\\rho(X) = 1 + \\rho(J(C))$\n\n### Step 5: Find the smallest possible rank for ρ(J(C))\nThe problem is now reduced to finding the minimum and maximum possible values of $\\rho(J(C))$ for a genus 3 curve C.\nFor a \"very general\" or \"generic\" curve C, its Jacobian $J(C)$ is a simple abelian variety whose ring of endomorphisms is just the integers, $End(J(C)) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$. In this case, the Neron-Severi group $NS(J(C))$ is generated by the class of the canonical principal polarization (the theta divisor).\nTherefore, for a generic curve C, $\\rho(J(C)) = 1$.\nThis is the minimum possible value for the rank of the Neron-Severi group of a Jacobian.\n\nThe smallest rank for $\\rho(X)$ is:\n$\\rho_{min}(X) = 1 + \\rho_{min}(J(C)) = 1 + 1 = 2$.\n\n### Step 6: Find the largest possible rank for ρ(J(C))\nThe rank $\\rho(J(C))$ is bounded by $h^{1,1}(J(C))$. For an abelian variety of dimension g, $h^{1,1} = g^2$.\nFor $J(C)$, we have $g=3$, so $h^{1,1}(J(C)) = 3^2 = 9$.\nThus, $\\rho(J(C)) \\le 9$.\n\nThis maximum value is achieved if and only if $J(C)$ is an abelian variety \"of CM type,\" which means that all of its Hodge classes of type (k,k) are algebraic. For abelian varieties, this is equivalent to $J(C)$ being isogenous to a product of elliptic curves with Complex Multiplication (CM).\n\nThe question now is whether there exists a genus 3 curve C whose Jacobian is isogenous to a product of three CM elliptic curves, $E_1 \\times E_2 \\times E_3$. The existence of such curves is well-known. A prominent example is the **Klein quartic curve**, defined by $x^3y + y^3z + z^3x = 0$. Its Jacobian is isogenous to the cube of a single CM elliptic curve, $E^3$, where E has CM by the quadratic imaginary field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-7})$. For this Jacobian, all Hodge classes are algebraic, so $\\rho(J(C))$ achieves the maximum possible value.\n$\\rho_{max}(J(C)) = h^{1,1}(J(C)) = 9$.\n\nThe largest rank for $\\rho(X)$ is:\n$\\rho_{max}(X) = 1 + \\rho_{max}(J(C)) = 1 + 9 = 10$.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe rank of the Neron-Severi group of $X = C^{(15)}$ is given by $\\rho(X) = 1 + \\rho(J(C))$.\n- The smallest possible rank corresponds to a generic curve C, for which $\\rho(J(C)) = 1$. This gives $\\rho(X) = 2$.\n- The largest possible rank corresponds to a special curve C with a CM-type Jacobian (e.g., the Klein quartic), for which $\\rho(J(C)) = 9$. This gives $\\rho(X) = 10$.\n\nThe smallest possible rank is 2.\nThe largest possible rank is 10.\n\n<<<The smallest rank is 2 and the largest rank is 10.>>>"
