    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**1. Preliminary Analysis of the function `f`**\n\nLet $S$ be the set of continuous functions $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ that satisfy the equation $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$. We want to find the cardinality of $S$, denoted as $|S|$.\n\n*   **Injectivity:** The function $g(x) = \\exp(x)$ is injective (one-to-one). We can show that this implies $f$ must also be injective. Suppose $f(x_1) = f(x_2)$. Applying $f$ to both sides gives $f(f(x_1)) = f(f(x_2))$, which means $\\exp(x_1) = \\exp(x_2)$. Since $\\exp(x)$ is injective, we have $x_1 = x_2$. Therefore, $f$ must be injective.\n\n*   **Monotonicity:** A continuous and injective function on $\\mathbb{R}$ must be strictly monotonic (either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing). So, we have two cases to consider.\n\n**2. Case 1: `f` is strictly decreasing**\n\nIf $f$ is strictly decreasing, then the composition $f \\circ f$ is strictly increasing. The function $\\exp(x)$ is strictly increasing, so this case is potentially possible.\n\nLet's analyze the behavior of $f$ at infinity:\n*   As $x \\to \\infty$, $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x) \\to \\infty$. Let $y = f(x)$. Since $f$ is decreasing, $y \\to L_+ = \\lim_{x\\to\\infty} f(x)$. The equation becomes $\\lim_{y \\to L_+} f(y) = \\infty$. For a decreasing function, this implies $L_+ = -\\infty$. So, $\\lim_{x\\to\\infty} f(x) = -\\infty$.\n*   As $x \\to -\\infty$, $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x) \\to 0$. Let $y = f(x)$. Since $f$ is decreasing, $y \\to L_- = \\lim_{x\\to-\\infty} f(x)$. The equation becomes $\\lim_{y \\to L_-} f(y) = 0$.\n\nIf $f$ were a bijection from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$, its range would be $(-\\infty, \\infty)$. So $L_-=\\infty$. Then we would have $\\lim_{y \\to \\infty} f(y) = 0$. This contradicts $\\lim_{x\\to\\infty} f(x) = -\\infty$.\n\nSo, the range of $f$ cannot be all of $\\mathbb{R}$. The range is $(L_+, L_-) = (-\\infty, L_-)$. From $\\lim_{y\\to L_-} f(y) = 0$, and the fact that $f$ is continuous and decreasing, this limit must be finite, so $L_- \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Also, by continuity, we can say that $f$ would approach the value 0 as its argument approaches $L_-$.\n\nSince $f$ is continuous and its range is $(-\\infty, L_-)$, it must be surjective onto this interval. By the Intermediate Value Theorem, since the range spans from negative values to positive values (as $f$ is decreasing and has a limit of $0$ at $L_-$), there must be a unique point $c \\in \\mathbb{R}$ such that $f(c) = 0$.\n\nNow let's use the functional equation on this point $c$:\n$f(f(c)) = \\exp(c) \\implies f(0) = \\exp(c)$.\nSince $f$ is strictly decreasing and $f(c)=0$, we can deduce the sign of $f(0)$:\n*   If $0 < c$, then $f(0) > f(c)=0$. So $\\exp(c) > 0$, which is always true.\n*   If $0 > c$, then $f(0) < f(c)=0$. So $\\exp(c) < 0$, which is impossible.\n*   If $0=c$, then $f(0)=0$. So $\\exp(0)=1 \\ne 0$, a contradiction.\nSo we must have $c > 0$.\n\nNow let's apply $f$ to the equation $f(0)=\\exp(c)$:\n$f(f(0)) = f(\\exp(c))$.\nUsing the original equation, $f(f(0)) = \\exp(0) = 1$.\nSo, $f(\\exp(c)) = 1$.\nWe have $f(c)=0$ and $f(\\exp(c))=1$. Since $f$ is strictly decreasing and $1>0$, we must have $\\exp(c) < c$.\n\nThe inequality $\\exp(c) < c$ has no real solution. We can see this by considering the function $h(x) = \\exp(x) - x$. Its derivative is $h'(x) = \\exp(x) - 1$, which is zero only at $x=0$. At $x=0$, $h(0)=1$, which is the minimum value of $h(x)$. So, $\\exp(x) - x \\ge 1 > 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$, meaning $\\exp(x) > x$.\n\nThe condition $\\exp(c) < c$ leads to a contradiction. Thus, there are **no strictly decreasing solutions**.\n\n**3. Case 2: `f` is strictly increasing**\n\nIf $f$ is strictly increasing, let's analyze the relation between $f(x)$ and $x$.\nThe equation $f(x)=x$ would imply $x = \\exp(x)$, which has no real solutions. Since $f(x)-x$ is a continuous function that is never zero, it must have a constant sign.\n*   If $f(x) < x$ for all $x$: Since $f$ is increasing, $f(f(x)) < f(x)$. This would mean $\\exp(x) < f(x) < x$. But we know $\\exp(x) > x$, so this is a contradiction.\n*   If $f(x) > x$ for all $x$: Since $f$ is increasing, $f(f(x)) > f(x)$. This means $\\exp(x) > f(x) > x$. This is consistent with $\\exp(x) > x$.\n\nSo any increasing solution must satisfy $x < f(x) < \\exp(x)$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nWe can construct these solutions. A standard method for equations of the form $f(f(x))=g(x)$ is to define $f$ on a suitable starting interval and then use the equation to extend its definition everywhere else.\nLet's consider that such a function $f$ might have a root, $f(c)=0$. Since $f(x)>x$, we must have $0>c$.\nFrom the equation:\n*   $f(f(c)) = f(0) = \\exp(c)$.\n*   $f(f(0)) = f(\\exp(c)) = \\exp(0) = 1$.\n\nSo we have points $(c, 0)$, $(0, \\exp(c))$, and $(\\exp(c), 1)$. Since $f$ is increasing and $c<0$:\n$c < 0 < \\exp(c) < 1$.\nThe images under $f$ must also be in increasing order:\n$f(c) < f(0) < f(\\exp(c))$.\n$0 < \\exp(c) < 1$.\nThis is consistent for any $c < 0$.\n\nThe construction of a solution $f$ now depends on some arbitrary choices:\n1.  **Choice of the root `c`:** Any value $c \\in (-\\infty, 0)$ can be chosen as the root of a potential solution $f$. The set of possible values for $c$ has cardinality $\\mathfrak{c}$ (the cardinality of the continuum).\n2.  **Choice of the function on an initial interval:** For a chosen $c<0$, we need to define $f$ on the interval $[c, 0]$. $f$ must be a continuous, strictly increasing function that maps $[c, 0]$ to $[0, \\exp(c)]$. This is an increasing homeomorphism between the two intervals. Let's call this function segment $h$. Any such choice of $h$ will work as a \"seed\" for the full solution. For example, we could pick the straight line $h(x) = \\frac{\\exp(c)}{-c}(x-c)$, but there are infinitely many other choices.\n\nThe set of all increasing homeomorphisms between two closed intervals has cardinality $\\mathfrak{c}$. This can be seen by mapping them to homeomorphisms of $[0,1]$ to itself, and then constructing an explicit injection from, say, $(1/3, 2/3)$ into this set of functions (e.g., functions that are polygonal chains through $(0,0), (1/2, y), (1,1)$ for $y \\in (1/3, 2/3)$).\n\nOnce we fix $c$ and the function $h$ on $[c, 0]$, the entire function $f$ is determined.\n*   For $x \\in [0, \\exp(c)]$, $x=h(t)$ for a unique $t \\in [c,0]$. We must define $f(x) = f(h(t)) = f(f(t)) = \\exp(t) = \\exp(h^{-1}(x))$.\n*   This process can be continued to define $f$ on a sequence of intervals that cover $[c, \\infty)$.\n*   A similar process using $f^{-1}$ can be used to extend the definition to $(-\\infty, c)$. Specifically, $f(t)=e^{f^{-1}(t)}$, which allows defining $f$ on intervals to the left of $c$.\n\nThe number of solutions is the number of possible choices we can make. We have $\\mathfrak{c}$ choices for the root $c$, and for each such choice, we have $\\mathfrak{c}$ choices for the initial function segment $h$.\nThe total number of solutions is $\\mathfrak{c} \\times \\mathfrak{c} = \\mathfrak{c}$.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\n*   There are no strictly decreasing continuous solutions.\n*   There are strictly increasing continuous solutions.\n*   The construction of these solutions depends on choices (the location of the root and the function's behavior on a fundamental interval) that can be made in $\\mathfrak{c}$ ways.\n*   The set of all continuous functions from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$ has cardinality $\\mathfrak{c}$, so the number of solutions cannot exceed $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n\nTherefore, the cardinality of the set of such functions is $\\mathfrak{c}$."
