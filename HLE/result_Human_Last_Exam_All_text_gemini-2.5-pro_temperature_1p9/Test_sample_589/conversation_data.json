    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the film in question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The query asks for a specific scene in a film with several key elements that must all be present:\n    *   **Film Type:** A Hollywood feature film.\n    *   **Studio:** Produced by a major film studio.\n    *   **Character:** A teenager.\n    *   **Prop:** The teenager is riding a pink bicycle.\n    *   **Action:** The teenager pedals the bike directly toward an oncoming car.\n\n2.  **Initial Brainstorming and Filtering:** We can think of several famous movies involving teenagers and bicycles, such as *E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial*, *The Goonies*, or *Now and Then*. However, we must filter these based on the very specific criteria.\n    *   *E.T.*: The protagonist is a pre-teen, not a teenager, and while there is an iconic bike scene, no one rides a pink bike toward an oncoming car.\n    *   *The Goonies*: Brandon Walsh rides a bike, but he is not on a pink bike and doesn't have a scene like the one described.\n    *   *Pretty in Pink*: The protagonist, Andie, drives a pink car, not a pink bike.\n\n3.  **Focus on Specific Details:** The combination of a \"pink bike\" and \"pedaling directly toward an oncoming car\" is a highly specific and defiant act. This points towards a dramatic or confrontational scene, likely establishing a character's bravery or rebellious nature.\n\n4.  **Identify a Potential Match:** The 2017 film adaptation of Stephen King's novel **\"It\"** features a scene that aligns perfectly with these details.\n\n5.  **Verify the Match Against Each Criterion:**\n    *   **Hollywood feature film from a major studio?** Yes. \"It\" (2017) was produced by New Line Cinema and distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures, both major players in the Hollywood film industry.\n    *   **Teenager?** Yes. The character in question is Beverly Marsh, a member of the \"Losers' Club\" who is a young teenager in the film.\n    *   **Pink bike?** Yes. Beverly Marsh rides a distinct, light-colored, retro-style girl's bicycle. While some might describe it as peach or salmon, it is clearly within the pink color family and is often identified as pink.\n    *   **Pedals directly toward an oncoming car?** Yes. There is a memorable scene early in the film where Beverly is riding her bike. A car full of bullies (including Greta Keene) pulls up alongside her, taunting and harassing her. Instead of being intimidated and moving aside, Beverly stares them down, stops pedaling momentarily, and then purposefully rides directly into the path of the oncoming car. Her act of defiance forces the driver to swerve violently at the last second to avoid a collision.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider:\n\n*   **Bike Color:** The precise shade of color in a film can be subjective due to lighting and color grading. However, Beverly's bike is unequivocally a light, pinkish color, fulfilling the spirit and letter of the description.\n*   **The Action:** The key is that the act is deliberate. The character doesn't accidentally swerve into traffic; she uses her position on the bike to challenge the car. Beverly's action is a clear act of defiance, which fits the description \"pedal directly toward an oncoming car.\"\n*   **Exclusivity:** This combination of elements is very specific and not a common trope. It is unlikely to appear in many other major films, making \"It\" (2017) the unique and correct answer.\n\n### Final Answer Acquisition:\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, every criterion in the question is met by a specific scene in the 2017 film \"It.\"\n\n<<<It (2017)>>>"
