    "### Analysis of the Question\n\nThe user's question is: \"How many triple crowns winners are there in MLB baseball?\"\n\nTo answer this question accurately, we must follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Define \"Triple Crown\":** In baseball, the term \"Triple Crown\" can refer to two different achievements: one for batters and one for pitchers. The batting Triple Crown is far more famous and is almost always what is meant when the term is used without qualification.\n    *   **Batting Triple Crown:** A player wins the batting Triple Crown by leading their respective league (American League or National League) in three key offensive categories in the same season: **batting average**, **home runs**, and **runs batted in (RBI)**.\n    *   **Pitching Triple Crown:** A pitcher wins the pitching Triple Crown by leading their league in **wins**, **strikeouts**, and **earned run average (ERA)**.\n\n2.  **Interpret the User's Intent:** Given the common usage, the question is almost certainly asking about the number of *batting* Triple Crown winners. A comprehensive answer should focus on this but can also mention the pitching Triple Crown for completeness.\n\n3.  **Distinguish Between \"Winners\" and \"Wins\":** The question asks for the number of \"winners\" (i.e., the number of unique players), not the number of times the Triple Crown has been won. This is a critical distinction, as some players have won it more than once.\n\n4.  **List and Count the Batting Triple Crown Winners:** We need to compile a list of all the players who have won the batting Triple Crown in MLB history, including early leagues that are now recognized as major leagues (like the American Association).\n\n    *   **Paul Hines** (1878) - National League\n    *   **Tip O'Neill** (1887) - American Association\n    *   **Hugh Duffy** (1894) - National League\n    *   **Nap Lajoie** (1901) - American League\n    *   **Ty Cobb** (1909) - American League\n    *   **Rogers Hornsby** (1922, 1925) - National League\n    *   **Jimmie Foxx** (1933) - American League\n    *   **Chuck Klein** (1933) - National League\n    *   **Lou Gehrig** (1934) - American League\n    *   **Joe Medwick** (1937) - National League\n    *   **Ted Williams** (1942, 1947) - American League\n    *   **Mickey Mantle** (1956) - American League\n    *   **Frank Robinson** (1966) - American League\n    *   **Carl Yastrzemski** (1967) - American League\n    *   **Miguel Cabrera** (2012) - American League\n\n5.  **Count the Unique Players:** By counting the unique names on the list above, we can determine the total number of winners.\n    *   Rogers Hornsby and Ted Williams each won the Triple Crown twice, but they are counted as single winners.\n    *   Counting each player only once, we get a total of **15** unique players.\n\n6.  **Address Careful Points and Nuances:**\n    *   **Historical Records:** The Triple Crown for Paul Hines in 1878 is sometimes disputed because RBI was not an official statistic at the time, and records are based on later research. However, he is included on most comprehensive historical lists.\n    *   **Different Leagues:** Tip O'Neill won his in the American Association, which is officially recognized by MLB as a major league for that era.\n    *   **Rarity:** The batting Triple Crown is one of the rarest and most celebrated achievements in baseball. It has only happened 17 times in total, with the most recent being Miguel Cabrera in 2012.\n\n7.  **Final Answer Formulation:** The analysis concludes that there are 15 unique players who have won the batting Triple Crown. This will be the final numerical answer. The explanation has covered the definition, the complete list, the distinction between winners and wins, and historical context.\n\n---\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, there have been 15 different players who have won the batting Triple Crown in MLB history.\n\n<<<15>>>"
