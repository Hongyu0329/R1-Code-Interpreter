    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The core of the question is to identify a specific \"conceptual entity.\" We are given several clues to identify it:\n    *   **Source:** The idea is referenced by historian Fernand Braudel.\n    *   **Originator:** Braudel is quoting an assertion made by Paul Morand.\n    *   **Context:** The assertion is part of Braudel's emphasis on a \"global historical perspective.\"\n    *   **Description:** The entity \"should be inscribed within a sphere.\" This \"sphere\" is a metaphor for the globe or the world as a whole.\n    *   **Example:** The entity is \"exemplified by the symbol of a nation.\" This means a nation is a type or an example of this larger entity.\n\n2.  **Identify Careful Points:**\n    *   **The Source of the Quote:** The crucial task is to locate the specific passage where Braudel quotes Morand. This is likely in one of Braudel's major works where he lays out his methodology, such as *The Mediterranean* or *Civilization and Capitalism*.\n    *   **The Metaphor:** \"Inscribed within a sphere\" means placing something in a global context, viewing it not as an isolated unit but in relation to everything else in the world. This directly aligns with Braudel's historiographical approach.\n    *   **The Relationship between the Entity and a \"Nation\":** The question states a nation is an *example* of this entity. This implies the entity is a broader concept than a nation. A nation's history, according to this view, can only be fully understood when placed within the context of this larger entity and, in turn, within the global \"sphere.\"\n\n3.  **Acquiring the Answer through Analysis:**\n    *   A search for the quote leads to the preface of Fernand Braudel's monumental work, *Civilization and Capitalism, 15th-18th Century, Vol. I: The Structures of Everyday Life*.\n    *   In the preface, Braudel outlines his intention to write a global history. He uses the Morand quote to illustrate his point.\n    *   The actual quote from Braudel's preface is: \"Paul Morand has remarked that â€˜A **civilization** should be contained within the circumference of a sphere which is then placed on the globe'. And I would willingly accept his image.\"\n    *   Here, we can see the pieces fall into place. The \"conceptual entity\" is explicitly named by Braudel (quoting Morand) as \"civilization.\"\n    *   A nation is indeed a component or an expression of a broader civilization (e.g., French nation within Western/European civilization). Braudel's argument is that one cannot understand the history of a single nation without understanding the history of the civilization it belongs to, and that civilization must be understood in its global context.\n    *   Therefore, the entity that should be \"inscribed within a sphere\" is a civilization.\n\n<<<civilization>>>"
