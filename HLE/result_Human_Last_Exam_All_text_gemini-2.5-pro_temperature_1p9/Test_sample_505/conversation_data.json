    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the maximum number of logical qubits that can be encoded in the given configuration.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Basics of a Single Surface Code Patch**\n\n*   A standard surface code is implemented on a 2D lattice of physical qubits. This is often referred to as a \"patch\".\n*   Topologically, a standard patch is a disk, which has one continuous boundary.\n*   A single, standard patch of surface code with boundaries encodes **one** logical qubit. The logical operators (like X and Z) for this qubit are represented by strings of physical operators that connect opposite boundaries of the patch.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Role of Holes**\n\n*   Holes can be introduced into the surface code lattice. A hole is a region within the patch where stabilizers are not measured, creating an additional inner boundary.\n*   Each hole introduced into a patch adds to the topological complexity of the surface.\n*   According to the principles of topological quantum computation, each hole added to a planar patch of surface code allows for the encoding of **one additional** logical qubit.\n*   Therefore, the number of logical qubits `k` that can be encoded in a single planar patch with `h` holes is given by the formula:\n    `k = 1 + h`\n    where the '1' comes from the original patch and 'h' is the number of added holes.\n\n**Step 3: Define the System Configuration**\n\n*   The problem specifies we have **two patches** of surface code. Since they are separate patches, they are physically and logically independent systems.\n*   The total number of logical qubits in the combined system is simply the sum of the logical qubits in each individual patch.\n    `k_total = k_patch1 + k_patch2`\n*   The problem also states we have a total of **two holes** to distribute among these two patches.\n\n**Step 4: Formulate the Maximization Problem**\n\nLet:\n*   `h1` be the number of holes in the first patch.\n*   `h2` be the number of holes in the second patch.\n\nWe have the constraint that the total number of holes is 2:\n`h1 + h2 = 2` (where `h1` and `h2` are non-negative integers)\n\nThe number of logical qubits in each patch is:\n*   `k_patch1 = 1 + h1`\n*   `k_patch2 = 1 + h2`\n\nThe total number of logical qubits is:\n`k_total = k_patch1 + k_patch2 = (1 + h1) + (1 + h2)`\n`k_total = 2 + h1 + h2`\n\nUsing our constraint `h1 + h2 = 2`, we can substitute it into the equation for `k_total`:\n`k_total = 2 + 2 = 4`\n\n**Step 5: Verify the Result for All Possible Hole Distributions**\n\nWe must check if the distribution of holes affects the total number of logical qubits. The possible distributions for the two holes are:\n\n*   **Case 1:** Two holes in the first patch, zero in the second (`h1 = 2`, `h2 = 0`).\n    *   `k_patch1 = 1 + 2 = 3` logical qubits.\n    *   `k_patch2 = 1 + 0 = 1` logical qubit.\n    *   `k_total = 3 + 1 = 4`.\n\n*   **Case 2:** One hole in the first patch, one in the second (`h1 = 1`, `h2 = 1`).\n    *   `k_patch1 = 1 + 1 = 2` logical qubits.\n    *   `k_patch2 = 1 + 1 = 2` logical qubits.\n    *   `k_total = 2 + 2 = 4`.\n\nIn all possible configurations, the total number of logical qubits is 4. Therefore, the maximum number is 4.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **\"Patch\" Interpretation:** The analysis assumes a \"patch\" is a planar surface code with boundaries. This is the standard interpretation. If it were a toroidal code (no boundaries), the base number of qubits would be 2, and the formula would change.\n2.  **Independent Systems:** The two patches are treated as separate systems. The total number of logical qubits is the sum of the qubits from each. If they were connected, they would form a single, more complex topological surface, requiring a different calculation.\n3.  **Maximum vs. Actual:** The question asks for the maximum. In this specific case, the total number of logical qubits is constant regardless of how the holes are distributed between the two patches. Thus, the maximum value is the only possible value.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nThe number of logical qubits in a system of `N` separate patches with a total of `H` holes distributed among them is:\n`k_total = N + H`\nIn this problem, `N = 2` (two patches) and `H = 2` (two holes).\n`k_total = 2 + 2 = 4`\n\n<<<4>>>"
