    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the order of the Galois group for the polynomial $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$.\n\n**Step 1: Check for irreducibility over $\\mathbb{Q}$**\n\nFirst, we must determine if the polynomial $f(x)$ is irreducible over the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n*   **Rational Root Test:** The possible rational roots are integer divisors of the constant term 14, which are $\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 7, \\pm 14$.\n    *   $f(1) = 1+8+14 = 23 \\neq 0$\n    *   $f(-1) = 1-8+14 = 7 \\neq 0$\n    *   $f(2) = 16+16+14 = 46 \\neq 0$\n    *   $f(-2) = 16-16+14 = 14 \\neq 0$\n    None of the integer divisors are roots, so $f(x)$ has no linear factors.\n*   **Check for quadratic factors:** We can test if $f(x)$ can be factored into two quadratic polynomials with integer coefficients: $(x^2+ax+b)(x^2+cx+d)$. Expanding this product and comparing coefficients with $x^4+0x^3+0x^2+8x+14$ gives a system of equations.\n    1.  $a+c=0 \\implies c=-a$\n    2.  $d+b+ac = 0 \\implies d+b-a^2=0$\n    3.  $ad+bc = 8 \\implies a(d-b)=8$\n    4.  $bd=14$\n    From (4), $(b, d)$ can be $(1,14), (-1,-14), (2,7), (-2,-7)$ (and their reversals). Substituting these pairs into (3), we find that none of them yield an integer solution for $a$. For example, if $(b,d)=(2,7)$, then $a(7-2)=5a=8$, so $a=8/5$, which is not an integer. Thus, $f(x)$ cannot be factored into quadratics with integer coefficients.\n*   **Conclusion on irreducibility:** Since $f(x)$ has no linear or quadratic factors over $\\mathbb{Z}$, by Gauss's Lemma, it is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nSince $f(x)$ is an irreducible quartic, its Galois group $G$ is a transitive subgroup of $S_4$. The possible groups are $S_4$ (order 24), $A_4$ (order 12), $D_4$ (dihedral group of order 8), $C_4$ (cyclic group of order 4), and $V_4$ (Klein four-group, order 4).\n\n**Step 2: Compute the Discriminant**\n\nThe discriminant $\\Delta$ of a polynomial helps determine if its Galois group is a subgroup of the alternating group $A_n$. The group $G$ is a subgroup of $A_n$ if and only if $\\Delta$ is a perfect square in $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nFor a polynomial of the form $x^4 + px + q$, the discriminant is $\\Delta = -27p^4 + 256q^3$. (This is a common variant, the one for $x^n+ax+b$ also works). Let's use the more general one for $x^n+ax+b$, $\\Delta = (-1)^{n(n-1)/2} (n^n b^{n-1} + (-1)^{n-1}(n-1)^{n-1}a^n)$.\nHere $n=4, p=c=8, q=d=14$.\n$\\Delta = (-1)^{4(3)/2} (4^4 (14)^{3} + (-1)^{4-1}(4-1)^{4-1}8^4)$\n$\\Delta = (-1)^6 (256 \\cdot 14^3 - 3^3 \\cdot 8^4)$\n$\\Delta = 256 \\cdot 2744 - 27 \\cdot 4096$\n$\\Delta = 702464 - 110592 = 591872$\nLet's find the prime factorization of $\\Delta$:\n$591872 = 256 \\times 2312 = 2^8 \\times (8 \\times 289) = 2^8 \\times 2^3 \\times 17^2 = 2^{11} \\cdot 17^2$.\nFor $\\Delta$ to be a perfect square, all exponents in its prime factorization must be even. The exponent of 2 is 11, which is odd.\nTherefore, $\\Delta$ is not a perfect square in $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nThis means the Galois group $G$ is **not** a subgroup of $A_4$. This eliminates $A_4$ (order 12) and $V_4$ (order 4) as possibilities. The remaining possible groups are $S_4$, $D_4$, and $C_4$.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Resolvent Cubic**\n\nTo distinguish among the remaining possibilities ($S_4$, $D_4$, $C_4$), we construct the resolvent cubic polynomial. For a quartic of the form $x^4+cx+d$, a resolvent cubic is $R(t) = t^3 - 4dt - c^2$.\nFor $f(x)=x^4+8x+14$, we have $c=8, d=14$.\n$R(t) = t^3 - 4(14)t - 8^2 = t^3 - 56t - 64$.\nThe nature of the roots of $R(t)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ determines the type of the Galois group:\n*   If $R(t)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$, then $G = S_4$.\n*   If $R(t)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$ (i.e., has at least one rational root), then $G$ is $D_4$ or $C_4$.\n\nLet's test for rational roots of $R(t)$ using the Rational Root Theorem. Potential rational roots are divisors of -64.\nLet's test $t=8$: $R(8) = 8^3 - 56(8) - 64 = 512 - 448 - 64 = 0$.\nSince $t=8$ is a rational root, the resolvent cubic $R(t)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. This eliminates $S_4$ as a possibility. The Galois group must be $D_4$ or $C_4$.\n\n**Step 4: Distinguish between $D_4$ and $C_4$**\n\nThe final step is to distinguish between the dihedral group $D_4$ (order 8) and the cyclic group $C_4$ (order 4). A standard criterion is to check if the original polynomial $f(x)$ is reducible over the field extension $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$.\n*   The Galois group $G=D_4$ if $f(x)$ is **reducible** over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$.\n*   The Galois group $G=C_4$ if $f(x)$ is **irreducible** over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$.\n\nOur field is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2^{11} \\cdot 17^2}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2 \\cdot (2^5 \\cdot 17)^2}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\nWe need to check if $f(x) = x^4+8x+14$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. If it is, it must factor into two quadratic polynomials (since it has no roots in $\\mathbb{Q}$, it can't have roots in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ unless they are of the form $a+b\\sqrt{2}$ where $b\\ne 0$, which is covered by the quadratic factor case).\nLet's assume the factorization has the form $(x^2+Ax+B)(x^2-Ax+D)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. (The $x$ coefficient must be opposite because the $x^3$ coefficient in $f(x)$ is zero).\nExpanding this gives $x^4 + (B+D-A^2)x^2 + A(D-B)x + BD$. Comparing coefficients with $x^4+8x+14$:\n1.  $B+D-A^2 = 0$\n2.  $A(D-B) = 8$\n3.  $BD=14$\nSolving this system leads to an equation for $A^2$: $A^6 - 56A^2 - 64 = 0$.\nIf we let $t=A^2$, we get $t^3-56t-64=0$, which is exactly our resolvent cubic.\nFor the factorization to exist over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, the coefficient $A$ must be in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. This means $A^2$ must be the square of an element in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\nThe roots of the resolvent cubic are the possible values for $A^2$. We already know one root is $t=8$.\nLet's check if $\\sqrt{8}$ is in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n$A^2=8 \\implies A = \\sqrt{8} = 2\\sqrt{2}$.\nSince $2\\sqrt{2}$ is an element of $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, a valid coefficient $A$ exists in this field. This means that the polynomial $f(x)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n\nTherefore, the Galois group $G$ is the dihedral group $D_4$.\n\n**Step 5: Final Answer**\n\nThe Galois group for $x^4+8x+14$ is $D_4$. The order of the group $D_4$ is 8."
