    "**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the chemical reaction:** The question is about the synthesis of Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF₄). This is produced by the direct reaction of Xenon (Xe) and Fluorine (F₂) gas. The balanced equation is:\n    Xe(g) + 2F₂(g) → XeF₄(s)\n\n2.  **Understand the reaction conditions:** This reaction is not spontaneous at room temperature and requires an input of energy to start. This energy is typically supplied in the form of heat (thermal method) or ultraviolet light (photochemical method). The product obtained (XeF₂, XeF₄, or XeF₆) is highly dependent on the specific conditions: temperature, pressure, and the ratio of the reactants.\n\n3.  **Analyze the role of temperature:** Temperature plays a crucial role in both the rate of the reaction and the type of product formed.\n    *   **Activation Energy:** A certain minimum temperature is required to provide the molecules with enough kinetic energy to overcome the activation energy barrier of the reaction. If the temperature is too low, the reaction will be extremely slow or will not proceed at all. This means it will not be \"efficient\".\n    *   **Product Selectivity:** As the temperature increases, the formation of higher xenon fluorides becomes more favorable.\n        *   At moderate temperatures, with an excess of fluorine, XeF₄ is the primary product.\n        *   At higher temperatures (e.g., above 500 °C) and with a large excess of fluorine, the formation of Xenon hexafluoride (XeF₆) becomes significant, reducing the yield and efficiency of XeF₄ production.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the specific temperature for XeF₄ synthesis:**\n    *   The most common and well-documented method for producing XeF₄ efficiently is the thermal method. This involves heating a mixture of xenon and fluorine (typically in a 1:5 molar ratio to ensure fluorine is in excess) in a suitable reaction vessel (like one made of nickel).\n    *   The standard, accepted temperature for this synthesis to be efficient is **400 °C**. At this temperature, the reaction proceeds at a reasonable rate to give a good yield of XeF₄ within a few hours.\n\n5.  **Examine the given answer choices based on the analysis:**\n    *   **F. -78 °C, E. 0 °C, D. 78 °C, C. 200 °C:** These temperatures are too low. While trace amounts of product might form over extremely long periods or with other energy sources like electric discharge, the thermal reaction would be impractically slow. Therefore, production at these temperatures cannot be considered \"efficient.\"\n    *   **B. 400 °C:** This is the textbook temperature for the efficient synthesis of XeF₄. The reaction rate is good, and the selectivity for XeF₄ is high.\n    *   **A. 600 °C:** This temperature is too high for the efficient production of *pure* XeF₄. At 600 °C, the formation of XeF₆ becomes a significant side reaction, which lowers the efficiency of producing the desired XeF₄.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** The question asks for the *coldest* temperature at which production is still *efficient*. While the reaction gets slower as the temperature drops from 400 °C, this is the lowest temperature on the list where the synthesis is widely considered efficient in terms of both rate and yield.\n\n<<<B>>>"
