    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of fluorine atoms in a hypothetical perfluoronanocar.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Term \"Perfluoronanocar\"\n\nFirst, we need to understand the two parts of the name:\n*   **Nanocar:** This refers to a class of molecules designed by scientists to resemble a macroscopic automobile. They typically have a chassis, axles, and wheels on a molecular scale. Since \"nanocar\" is a general term and not a specific molecule, we must choose a representative and well-known structure to analyze.\n*   **Perfluoro-:** This is a standard prefix in chemistry. It means that **all** of the hydrogen atoms in an organic parent compound have been replaced by fluorine atoms.\n\n### Step 2: Select a Representative Nanocar Structure and Find its Formula\n\nThere are many different nanocar molecules. One of the earliest and most iconic conceptual designs, developed by Professor James Tour's research group, is a good candidate for this hypothetical analysis. This nanocar consists of:\n*   A central hydrocarbon **chassis and axle system**.\n*   Four **wheels** made of buckminsterfullerene (also known as \"buckyballs\" or C₆₀).\n\nThe chemical formula for the hydrocarbon chassis/axle framework of this specific nanocar design is **C₃₀H₂₄**.\nThe chemical formula for each buckyball wheel is **C₆₀**. Since C₆₀ is pure carbon, it contains no hydrogen atoms.\n\nTherefore, the total chemical formula for this representative nanocar is the sum of the chassis and the four wheels:\nC₃₀H₂₄ + 4 * (C₆₀) = **C₂₇₀H₂₄**\n\n### Step 3: Apply the \"Perfluoro-\" Rule to Determine the Number of Fluorine Atoms\n\nNow we apply the \"perfluoro-\" prefix to our chosen nanocar model (C₂₇₀H₂₄).\n*   The rule is to replace every hydrogen (H) atom with a fluorine (F) atom.\n*   Our nanocar molecule has **24 hydrogen atoms**.\n\nFollowing the rule, we replace all 24 hydrogen atoms with 24 fluorine atoms. The carbon backbone remains unchanged.\n*   Original formula: C₂₇₀**H₂₄**\n*   Perfluorinated formula: C₂₇₀**F₂₄**\n\n### Step 4: Final Conclusion\n\nBy analyzing a representative nanocar structure and applying the chemical definition of \"perfluoro-\", we can conclude that a hypothetical perfluoronanocar would contain the same number of fluorine atoms as the parent molecule had hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n*   **Ambiguity of \"Nanocar\":** The final answer depends entirely on which specific nanocar structure is chosen as the parent compound. Different nanocar designs have different numbers of hydrogen atoms. The C₂₇₀H₂₄ model is a common and logical choice for this general question.\n*   **Hypothetical Nature:** The question is hypothetical. The actual synthesis and stability of a C₂₇₀F₂₄ molecule are not considered, only its theoretical composition based on nomenclature.\n\nBased on this step-by-step analysis, the perfluorinated version of a classic nanocar design would have 24 fluorine atoms.\n\n<<<24>>>"
