    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the probability of the particle's location in the specified interval.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the System and the Question\nThe problem asks for the probability of finding a particle in a one-dimensional (1D) infinite potential well (a \"box\") of length `a`. The particle is in the second energy level, denoted by the principal quantum number `n = 2`. The specific location of interest is a small interval from `x = 0.495a` to `x = 0.505a`.\n\n### Step 2: Recall the Necessary Formulas\n1.  **Wavefunction for a particle in a 1D box:** The normalized wavefunction for a particle in a 1D box extending from `x=0` to `x=a` is given by:\n    $ψ_n(x) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{a}} \\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{a}\\right)$\n2.  **Probability Density:** The probability of finding the particle at a specific position `x` is given by the probability density function, $P(x)$, which is the square of the magnitude of the wavefunction:\n    $P(x) = |ψ_n(x)|^2$\n3.  **Probability in an Interval:** The probability of finding the particle within a specific interval from $x_1$ to $x_2$ is found by integrating the probability density function over that interval:\n    $P(x_1 < x < x_2) = \\int_{x_1}^{x_2} |ψ_n(x)|^2 \\,dx$\n\n### Step 3: Apply the Given Parameters\n*   Quantum number: `n = 2`\n*   Interval start: $x_1 = 0.495a$\n*   Interval end: $x_2 = 0.505a$\n\nFirst, let's write the specific wavefunction and probability density for `n = 2`:\n*   Wavefunction: $ψ_2(x) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{a}} \\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x}{a}\\right)$\n*   Probability Density: $|ψ_2(x)|^2 = \\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{a}} \\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x}{a}\\right)\\right)^2 = \\frac{2}{a} \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x}{a}\\right)$\n\n### Step 4: Set Up the Probability Integral\nNow, we set up the definite integral for the probability in the interval $[0.495a, 0.505a]$:\n$P = \\int_{0.495a}^{0.505a} \\frac{2}{a} \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x}{a}\\right) \\,dx$\n\n### Step 5: Solve the Integral\nTo solve this integral, we use the trigonometric power-reduction identity: $\\sin^2(\\theta) = \\frac{1 - \\cos(2\\theta)}{2}$.\nIn our case, $\\theta = \\frac{2\\pi x}{a}$, so $2\\theta = \\frac{4\\pi x}{a}$.\n\nSubstitute the identity into the integral:\n$P = \\int_{0.495a}^{0.505a} \\frac{2}{a} \\left(\\frac{1 - \\cos\\left(\\frac{4\\pi x}{a}\\right)}{2}\\right) \\,dx$\n$P = \\frac{1}{a} \\int_{0.495a}^{0.505a} \\left(1 - \\cos\\left(\\frac{4\\pi x}{a}\\right)\\right) \\,dx$\n\nNow, find the antiderivative:\n$\\int \\left(1 - \\cos\\left(\\frac{4\\pi x}{a}\\right)\\right) \\,dx = x - \\frac{a}{4\\pi}\\sin\\left(\\frac{4\\pi x}{a}\\right)$\n\nEvaluate the definite integral using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus:\n$P = \\frac{1}{a} \\left[x - \\frac{a}{4\\pi}\\sin\\left(\\frac{4\\pi x}{a}\\right)\\right]_{0.495a}^{0.505a}$\n$P = \\frac{1}{a} \\left( \\left(0.505a - \\frac{a}{4\\pi}\\sin\\left(\\frac{4\\pi (0.505a)}{a}\\right)\\right) - \\left(0.495a - \\frac{a}{4\\pi}\\sin\\left(\\frac{4\\pi (0.495a)}{a}\\right)\\right) \\right)$\n\nGroup the terms:\n$P = \\frac{1}{a} \\left( (0.505a - 0.495a) - \\frac{a}{4\\pi} \\left( \\sin(4\\pi \\cdot 0.505) - \\sin(4\\pi \\cdot 0.495) \\right) \\right)$\n$P = \\frac{1}{a} \\left( 0.01a - \\frac{a}{4\\pi} \\left( \\sin(2.02\\pi) - \\sin(1.98\\pi) \\right) \\right)$\n\nSimplify by dividing by `a`:\n$P = 0.01 - \\frac{1}{4\\pi} \\left( \\sin(2.02\\pi) - \\sin(1.98\\pi) \\right)$\n\n### Step 6: Evaluate the Trigonometric Functions\nUse the angle addition/subtraction properties of sine:\n*   $\\sin(2.02\\pi) = \\sin(2\\pi + 0.02\\pi) = \\sin(0.02\\pi)$\n*   $\\sin(1.98\\pi) = \\sin(2\\pi - 0.02\\pi) = -\\sin(0.02\\pi)$\n\nSubstitute these back into the expression for P:\n$P = 0.01 - \\frac{1}{4\\pi} (\\sin(0.02\\pi) - (-\\sin(0.02\\pi)))$\n$P = 0.01 - \\frac{1}{4\\pi} (2\\sin(0.02\\pi))$\n$P = 0.01 - \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\sin(0.02\\pi)$\n\n### Step 7: Calculate the Final Numerical Value\nNow, we calculate the numerical value. We must use radians for the argument of the sine function.\n*   Argument of sine: $0.02\\pi \\approx 0.02 \\times 3.14159 = 0.0628318$ radians.\n*   $\\sin(0.02\\pi) \\approx \\sin(0.0628318) \\approx 0.0627905$\n*   $P \\approx 0.01 - \\frac{1}{2 \\times 3.14159} \\times 0.0627905$\n*   $P \\approx 0.01 - (0.159155) \\times (0.0627905)$\n*   $P \\approx 0.01 - 0.00999342$\n*   $P \\approx 0.000006578$\n\nThis can be written in scientific notation as $6.578 \\times 10^{-6}$.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n1.  **Approximation:** A common quick approximation for small intervals is $P \\approx |ψ(x_c)|^2 \\Delta x$, where $x_c$ is the center of the interval. Here, $x_c = 0.5a$. For n=2, the probability density at this point is $|ψ_2(0.5a)|^2 = \\frac{2}{a} \\sin^2(\\frac{2\\pi (0.5a)}{a}) = \\frac{2}{a}\\sin^2(\\pi) = 0$. This approximation would incorrectly yield a probability of zero. The failure occurs because the center of the interval is a node (a point of zero probability), and the function is not constant around this point.\n2.  **Units:** Ensure that calculations involving trigonometric functions use radians, not degrees.\n3.  **Accuracy:** Since the result involves subtracting two very close numbers ($0.01$ and $\\frac{\\sin(0.02\\pi)}{2\\pi}$), it is important to maintain high precision during intermediate calculations to avoid rounding errors. Using Taylor series expansion is an alternative method that confirms this result.\n\nThe probability is approximately $6.58 \\times 10^{-6}$.\n\n<<<6.58e-6>>>"
