    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which animal might be able to hear human muscle twitches.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the sound produced by human muscle twitches.\nFirst, we need to know the characteristics of the sound in question. When a human muscle tenses or contracts, it produces a very low-frequency vibration or rumble. This sound is generally in the range of 25 to 50 Hertz (Hz). For context, the lowest note on a standard piano is about 27.5 Hz. This is a very deep, low-pitched sound. Frequencies below 20 Hz are considered \"infrasound.\"\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the hearing range of each animal in the answer choices.\nNow, let's examine the typical hearing range for each animal listed to see if the 25-50 Hz frequency falls within their audible spectrum.\n\n*   **A. Dog:** A dog's hearing range is approximately 67 Hz to 45,000 Hz. Their hearing is excellent at high frequencies (ultrasound), which is why they can hear dog whistles that are silent to humans. However, their ability to hear low frequencies is worse than humans. Since muscle twitches are below 67 Hz, a dog would not be able to hear them.\n*   **B. Bat:** Bats are famous for using echolocation, which involves producing and hearing extremely high-frequency sounds (ultrasound), often ranging from 2,000 Hz up to 110,000 Hz or even higher. Their hearing is specialized for these high frequencies and they are effectively deaf to the very low frequencies of muscle twitches.\n*   **C. Herring:** Some species of fish, including herring, have exceptionally sensitive low-frequency hearing. The herring possesses a direct connection between its swim bladder (which vibrates in response to sound) and its inner ear. This adaptation allows it to detect sounds in the infrasound range (below 20 Hz) and other low frequencies. Scientific studies have shown that some fish can detect the low-frequency sounds produced by the contracting muscles of an approaching predator. This gives them an early warning. The 25-50 Hz range of a muscle twitch falls comfortably within a herring's hearing capabilities.\n*   **D. Whale:** Whales can be divided into two groups with different hearing specializations. Toothed whales (like dolphins) hear well at high frequencies. Baleen whales (like blue and fin whales), however, are specialists in low-frequency sound, using it to communicate over vast ocean distances. Their hearing range can extend down to 7 Hz. Therefore, a baleen whale could certainly hear a sound in the 25-50 Hz range if it were close enough and the sound were loud enough.\n*   **E. Human:** The standard range of human hearing is 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz. While the 25-50 Hz of a muscle twitch is technically within our hearing range, the sound is usually too faint for our ears to perceive. Some people can hear their own muscle rumble by plugging their ears and tensing their jaw or neck muscles, but it's not something humans can generally hear from others.\n\n### Step 3: Compare the viable options and select the best answer.\nBoth herring and baleen whales have the physiological ability to hear frequencies in the range of a human muscle twitch. However, the herring is a classic and well-documented example of an animal whose survival strategy involves detecting these specific types of low-frequency sounds to evade predators. The context implies detecting a subtle, nearby sound, which is a better fit for a small animal like a herring detecting a predator than a massive whale. For this reason, the herring is considered the best and most precise answer.\n\n### Final Conclusion:\nBased on the analysis, the herring has a specialized hearing system that makes it highly sensitive to the very low frequencies produced by muscle contractions.\n\n<<<C>>>"
