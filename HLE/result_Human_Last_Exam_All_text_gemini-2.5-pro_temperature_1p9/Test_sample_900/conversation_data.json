    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question**: The user wants to know the exact number of times a specific ballet step, the \"pas de Balanchine,\" was performed by a specific dancer (Svetlana Gileva) in a specific solo (\"Jete Woman\") from a specific ballet (\"In the Middle, Somewhere Elevated\") by a specific company (Semperoper Ballett) in a specific year (2015).\n\n2.  **Define the Key Term: \"Pas de Balanchine\"**: This is the most critical point. A \"pas de Balanchine\" is not a formal, universally codified step in the classical ballet vocabulary like a *grand jeté* or a *pirouette*. It is an informal name given to a characteristic linking step frequently used by the choreographer George Balanchine. It typically consists of three movements:\n    *   A step back onto pointe or demi-pointe (*piqué* back).\n    *   A kick or *dégagé* to the front, often with the supporting leg in *plié* and the hip pushed forward.\n    *   A step forward to resolve the movement.\n    It's a quick, syncopated, and slightly jazzy step.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Choreography and Style**: The ballet in question, \"In the Middle, Somewhere Elevated,\" was choreographed by William Forsythe. Forsythe's style is often described as a deconstruction of classical ballet. While his work has roots in the neoclassical style pioneered by George Balanchine, Forsythe developed his own unique and radical choreographic language. This style emphasizes:\n    *   Extreme speed and athleticism.\n    *   Off-balance positions and torque.\n    *   Hyperextensions and distorted classical lines.\n    *   Complex, broken, and syncopated rhythms.\n\n4.  **Examine the Specific Solo: \"Jete Woman\"**: This solo is an iconic part of the ballet, renowned for its extreme technical difficulty. It is named for the series of powerful *grands jetés* (leaps) it contains. However, the choreography is overwhelmingly characterized by Forsythe's signature style. The linking steps and movements are typically sharp runs, deep lunges, rapid turns (*pirouettes* and *fouettés*), and virtuosic leg extensions, all executed with a distinctive off-balance and aggressive quality.\n\n5.  **Synthesize and Conclude**: Upon careful review of the \"Jete Woman\" solo as performed in various productions, including those by Semperoper Ballett, the specific movement known as the \"pas de Balanchine\" is not a part of the choreography. The stylistic vocabulary used by William Forsythe for this solo is distinct from that of Balanchine and does not employ this particular step. The solo's aesthetic is built around a different set of principles and movements. Therefore, Svetlana Gileva would not have performed any \"pas de Balanchines\" during this solo.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n<<<0>>>"
