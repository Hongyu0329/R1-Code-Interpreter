    "Answering this question requires combining several key results from continuum theory and general topology. Let's break down the problem into a series of logical steps.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the objects in question.**\n*   **$X$**: A hereditary indecomposable metric continuum.\n    *   A **continuum** is a non-empty, compact, connected metric space.\n    *   **Indecomposable** means it cannot be expressed as the union of two proper subcontinua.\n    *   **Hereditarily indecomposable** means every subcontinuum of $X$ is also indecomposable. A famous example is the pseudo-arc.\n    *   **Metric** implies that distances are defined and the topology comes from this metric. A key consequence is that every point is a $G_\\delta$-set (i.e., can be written as a countable intersection of open sets).\n*   **$x$**: An arbitrary point in $X$. Since a continuum must be non-empty, we can assume $X$ is not a single point (otherwise $X\\setminus\\{x\\}$ is empty and the question is trivial).\n*   **$Y = X \\setminus \\{x\\}$**: The space we are studying. This is a topological space with one point removed from a continuum.\n*   **Stone-Čech Compactification $\\beta Y$**: The maximal compactification of $Y$.\n*   **Stone-Čech Remainder $Y^* = \\beta Y \\setminus Y$**: This is the set of \"new\" points added to $Y$ to make it compact. We need to find the number of aomposants of this remainder.\n*   **Composant**: In an indecomposable continuum, a composant is a maximal set of points that can be connected by proper subcontinua. An indecomposable continuum is partitioned into its disjoint aomposants.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the topological nature of the remainder $Y^*$.**\n\n1.  **Is $Y^*$ a continuum?**\n    *   The space $Y = X \\setminus \\{x\\}$ is connected. This is because in an indecomposable continuum, no point is a cut point. If removing $x$ disconnected $X$, $X$ would be the union of two separated sets joined at $x$, making it decomposable.\n    *   $Y$ is also locally compact (since it's an open subset of a compact space $X$) and non-compact (unless $X$ was a single point).\n    *   It is a standard theorem in topology that for a connected, locally compact, non-compact space $Y$, its Stone-Čech remainder $Y^*$ is a continuum (i.e., it is compact, connected, and non-empty).\n\n2.  **Is $Y^*$ non-degenerate (i.e., not a single point)?**\n    *   There is a continuous surjective map $f: \\beta Y \\to X$ which is the identity on $Y$ and maps the entire remainder $Y^*$ to the single point $\\{x\\}$.\n    *   If $Y^*$ were a single point, say $Y^* = \\{p\\}$, then this map $f$ would be a bijection between the compact Hausdorff spaces $\\beta Y$ and $X$. A continuous bijection between compact Hausdorff spaces is a homeomorphism. So, $\\beta Y \\cong X$.\n    *   The statement $\\beta(X \\setminus \\{x\\}) \\cong X$ means that every bounded continuous real-valued function on $X \\setminus \\{x\\}$ can be extended continuously to the point $x$.\n    *   However, because $X$ is a metric space, the singleton set $\\{x\\}$ is a $G_\\delta$-set. A known theorem states that if a point $x$ in a compactification $X$ of a space $Y = X \\setminus \\{x\\}$ is a $G_\\delta$-set, then not all bounded continuous functions on $Y$ can be extended to $x$. This implies $\\beta Y$ is not homeomorphic to $X$.\n    *   This contradiction shows that our initial assumption was false. $Y^*$ cannot be a single point. It is a non-degenerate continuum.\n\n3.  **Is $Y^*$ indecomposable?**\n    *   A significant theorem by David P. Bellamy (1973) states that if $X$ is an indecomposable metric continuum and $x \\in X$, then the remainder $Y^* = \\beta(X \\setminus \\{x\\}) \\setminus (X \\setminus \\{x\\})$ is an indecomposable continuum.\n    *   Since our $X$ is hereditary indecomposable, it is certainly indecomposable. Thus, Bellamy's theorem applies, and we can conclude that $Y^*$ is an indecomposable continuum.\n\n**Step 3: Count the number of aomposants of $Y^*$.**\n\n*   We have established that $Y^*$ is a non-degenerate indecomposable continuum.\n*   A fundamental theorem of continuum theory states that any non-degenerate indecomposable continuum has uncountably many pairwise disjoint aomposants.\n*   More specifically, the number of aomposants is equal to $c$, the cardinality of the continuum ($c = 2^{\\aleph_0}$).\n\n**Step 4: Consider the \"maximum possible\" condition.**\n\n*   The analysis above holds for *any* hereditary indecomposable metric continuum $X$ (that is not a single point) and *any* point $x \\in X$.\n*   In every such case, the remainder $Y^*$ is a non-degenerate indecomposable continuum.\n*   The number of aomposants for any such space is always $c=2^{\\aleph_0}$.\n*   Therefore, the number of aomposants is constant across all possible choices of $X$ and $x$. The maximum possible number is this constant value.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n\n*   The \"metric\" property of $X$ is crucial for the argument that the remainder is non-degenerate.\n*   The \"indecomposable\" property of $X$ is crucial for the argument that the remainder is indecomposable.\n*   The \"hereditarily indecomposable\" property is a stronger condition than what is needed for the main steps of the argument. It's known that this property also passes to the remainder (i.e., $Y^*$ is also hereditarily indecomposable), but this does not change the number of aomposants. The number of aomposants of a non-degenerate hereditarily indecomposable continuum is the same as for a non-degenerate indecomposable one.\n*   The number of aomposants is an infinite cardinality, not a finite integer.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis, for any given hereditary indecomposable metric continuum $X$ and point $x \\in X$, the Stone-Čech remainder of $X \\setminus \\{x\\}$ is a non-degenerate indecomposable continuum. Any such continuum has exactly $c = 2^{\\aleph_0}$ aomposants. As this number is constant for all valid choices, the maximum possible number is $2^{\\aleph_0}$."
