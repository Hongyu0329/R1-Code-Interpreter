No. Spontaneous parametric downconversion (SPDC) is a second-order nonlinear optical process that requires a material with a non-zero second-order susceptibility, $\chi^{(2)}$. This property is only present in materials that lack a center of inversion symmetry (i.e., are non-centrosymmetric). The most stable and commonly studied phases of free-standing boron nanosheets (borophene), such as the $\beta_{12}$ and $\chi_3$ phases, are centrosymmetric. Due to this inherent inversion symmetry, their bulk $\chi^{(2)}$ is zero, and therefore they are not expected to exhibit intrinsic SPDC.
