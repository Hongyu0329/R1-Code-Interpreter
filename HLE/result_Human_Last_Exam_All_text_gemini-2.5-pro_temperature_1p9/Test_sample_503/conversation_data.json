    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of internal adjunctions in the simplex category $\\Delta$ from $[23]$ to $[37]$.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the context and definitions\n1.  **The Simplex Category $\\Delta$**: The objects of $\\Delta$ are the finite ordinals, denoted by $[n] = \\{0, 1, 2, \\dots, n\\}$ for $n \\ge 0$. A morphism $f: [n] \\to [m]$ is a non-decreasing function, i.e., if $i \\le j$ in $[n]$, then $f(i) \\le f(j)$ in $[m]$.\n2.  **Locally posetal 2-subcategory of $\\mathsf{Pos}$**: This tells us how to view $\\Delta$ as a 2-category.\n    *   The objects are the objects of $\\Delta$, i.e., the posets $[n]$.\n    *   The 1-morphisms are the morphisms of $\\Delta$, i.e., non-decreasing functions.\n    *   For any two morphisms $f, g: [n] \\to [m]$, there is a 2-morphism from $f$ to $g$ if and only if $f \\le g$ in the pointwise order. That is, $f(i) \\le g(i)$ for all $i \\in [n]$. This means that the hom-category $\\text{Hom}_{\\Delta}([n], [m])$ is a poset.\n3.  **Internal Adjunction**: An adjunction is \"internal\" to $\\Delta$. This means it is defined in terms of the objects, 1-morphisms, and 2-morphisms of $\\Delta$. An adjunction from an object $A$ to an object $B$ consists of a pair of 1-morphisms, a left adjoint $f: A \\to B$ and a right adjoint $g: B \\to A$, along with two 2-morphisms: the unit $\\eta: \\text{id}_A \\to g \\circ f$ and the counit $\\epsilon: f \\circ g \\to \\text{id}_B$, which must satisfy the triangle identities.\n\n### Step 2: Translate the definition of an adjunction to the specific context of $\\Delta$\nLet's apply the definition of an adjunction from $A = [23]$ to $B = [37]$.\n*   The left adjoint is a non-decreasing map $f: [23] \\to [37]$.\n*   The right adjoint is a non-decreasing map $g: [37] \\to [23]$.\n*   The unit $\\eta$ is a 2-morphism $\\text{id}_{[23]} \\to g \\circ f$. By the definition of 2-morphisms in $\\Delta$, this means $\\text{id}_{[23]}(i) \\le (g \\circ f)(i)$ for all $i \\in [23]$. In other words:\n    (i) $i \\le g(f(i))$ for all $i \\in \\{0, \\dots, 23\\}$.\n*   The counit $\\epsilon$ is a 2-morphism $f \\circ g \\to \\text{id}_{[37]}$. This means $(f \\circ g)(j) \\le \\text{id}_{[37]}(j)$ for all $j \\in [37]$. In other words:\n    (ii) $f(g(j)) \\le j$ for all $j \\in \\{0, \\dots, 37\\}$.\n\nThe triangle identities state that certain composite 2-morphisms must be identity 2-morphisms. In a locally posetal 2-category, this means certain inequalities must be equalities. Specifically, we need $f \\circ g \\circ f = f$ and $g \\circ f \\circ g = g$. These equalities are in fact consequences of conditions (i) and (ii):\n*   Apply $f$ (which is non-decreasing) to (i): $f(i) \\le f(g(f(i)))$. This shows $f \\le f \\circ g \\circ f$.\n*   Let $i' = f(i)$ in inequality (ii): $f(g(f(i))) \\le f(i)$. This shows $f \\circ g \\circ f \\le f$.\n*   Since we have both inequalities, we must have $f \\circ g \\circ f = f$.\n*   A similar argument shows $g \\circ f \\circ g = g$.\nThus, an adjunction from $[23]$ to $[37]$ is completely determined by a pair of non-decreasing maps $(f,g)$ satisfying the two inequalities (i) and (ii). This is the standard definition of a Galois connection or an adjunction between posets.\n\n### Step 3: Characterize adjoint maps between linear orders\nA key result from order theory states that an adjunction between posets is uniquely determined by either the left or the right adjoint.\n*   **Characterization of Left Adjoints**: A non-decreasing map $f: [n] \\to [m]$ has a right adjoint if and only if for every $j \\in [m]$, the set $\\{ i \\in [n] \\mid f(i) \\le j \\}$ has a maximum element. Since $[n]$ is a finite totally ordered set, this condition is equivalent to the set being non-empty for all $j$. For this to hold, we need to ensure the set is non-empty for $j=0$. This requires the existence of an $i \\in [n]$ such that $f(i) \\le 0$, which implies $f(i)=0$. As $f$ is non-decreasing, this means $f(0)=0$.\n    So, a non-decreasing map $f: [n] \\to [m]$ is a left adjoint if and only if $f(0)=0$.\n\n*   **Characterization of Right Adjoints**: Similarly, a non-decreasing map $g: [m] \\to [n]$ has a left adjoint if and only if for every $i \\in [n]$, the set $\\{ j \\in [m] \\mid i \\le g(j) \\}$ has a minimum element. This is equivalent to this set being non-empty for all $i$. For this to hold, we need to ensure the set is non-empty for $i=n$. This requires the existence of a $j \\in [m]$ such that $n \\le g(j)$, which implies $g(j)=n$. As $g$ is non-decreasing, this means $g(m)=n$.\n    So, a non-decreasing map $g: [m] \\to [n]$ is a right adjoint if and only if $g(m)=n$.\n\n### Step 4: Formulate the counting problem\nThe number of adjunctions is the number of possible left adjoints $f$, which is also the number of possible right adjoints $g$. We can choose whichever is easier to count. Let's count the number of right adjoints.\nWe need to count the number of non-decreasing maps $g: [37] \\to [23]$ that are right adjoints. Based on Step 3, this is the number of non-decreasing functions $g: \\{0, 1, \\dots, 37\\} \\to \\{0, 1, \\dots, 23\\}$ satisfying the condition $g(37) = 23$.\n\nLet's analyze this counting problem:\n*   The function $g$ must be non-decreasing: $g(0) \\le g(1) \\le \\dots \\le g(36) \\le g(37)$.\n*   The value of $g(37)$ is fixed at 23.\n*   The non-decreasing condition implies $g(i) \\le g(37) = 23$ for all $i \\le 37$. This condition is already satisfied by the definition of the codomain, $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 23\\}$.\n*   Therefore, the problem reduces to counting the number of non-decreasing sequences $g(0), g(1), \\dots, g(36)$ where each value is chosen from $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 23\\}$.\n*   This is equivalent to counting the number of non-decreasing maps from $[36]$ to $[23]$.\n\n### Step 5: Solve the counting problem\nThis is a classic combinatorial problem that can be solved using \"stars and bars\".\n*   We need to determine the values of a non-decreasing sequence of length 37 (from $g(0)$ to $g(36)$).\n*   The values are chosen from the set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 23\\}$, which has $24$ elements.\n*   This is equivalent to choosing 37 items from 24 categories with repetition allowed. The number of ways to do this is given by the multiset coefficient formula:\n    $$ \\binom{n+k-1}{k} $$\n*   Here, $k$ is the number of items to choose, which is the size of the domain $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 36\\}$. So, $k=37$.\n*   And $n$ is the number of categories to choose from, which is the size of the codomain $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 23\\}$. So, $n=24$.\n*   The total number of such maps is:\n    $$ \\binom{24+37-1}{37} = \\binom{60}{37} $$\n*   Using the identity $\\binom{N}{K} = \\binom{N}{N-K}$, this is also:\n    $$ \\binom{60}{60-37} = \\binom{60}{23} $$\n\nAs a check, we can count the number of left adjoints $f: [23] \\to [37]$. These are non-decreasing maps satisfying $f(0)=0$. This means we only need to choose the values for $f(1), \\dots, f(23)$ in a non-decreasing sequence from the codomain $\\{0, \\dots, 37\\}$.\n*   Domain size $k=23$.\n*   Codomain size $n=38$.\n*   Number of maps: $\\binom{38+23-1}{23} = \\binom{60}{23}$.\nThe results match, confirming our reasoning.\n\nThe number of internal adjunctions is $\\binom{60}{23}$.\n\n<<<27503756880415350>>>"
