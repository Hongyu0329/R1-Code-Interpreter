    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of each ballet step to determine which one ends in the same leg position as it starts.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core question.**\nThe question asks to identify the ballet step from the given list where the final leg position is identical to the initial leg position. This means if the step starts in fifth position with the right foot in front, it must also end in fifth position with the right foot in front.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze each answer choice.**\n\n*   **A. Entrechat six**\n    *   **Starting Position:** Fifth position (e.g., right foot front).\n    *   **Execution:** \"Entrechat\" means interweaving or braided. It is a vertical jump where the legs beat against each other in the air. The number indicates the number of movements (crossings/openings). Even-numbered entrechats (quatre, six, huit) are defined as landing on two feet in the *same position* from which they started. Odd-numbered entrechats (trois, cinq) land on one foot. Therefore, an entrechat six begins in fifth and lands in the exact same fifth position.\n    *   **Ending Position:** Same as the starting position.\n\n*   **B. Échappé battu changé**\n    *   **Starting Position:** Fifth position (e.g., right foot front).\n    *   **Execution:**\n        *   \"Échappé\" means escaped; it's a jump from a closed position (fifth) to an open one (second).\n        *   \"Battu\" means beaten; the legs beat together before opening into second position.\n        *   \"Changé\" means changed. This is the key part of the name. It indicates that when jumping from second position back to fifth, the feet will land in the *opposite* configuration.\n    *   **Ending Position:** The opposite fifth position from the start (e.g., left foot front). The legs have changed.\n\n*   **C. Assemblé**\n    *   **Starting Position:** Typically fifth position.\n    *   **Execution:** \"Assemblé\" means to assemble. One leg brushes out, the dancer pushes off the supporting leg, and the legs join (\"assemble\") in the air before landing simultaneously in fifth position. The most common forms are `assemblé dessus` (over) and `assemblé dessous` (under), both of which cause the feet to change positions. For example, in an `assemblé dessus`, the back leg travels over to land in front.\n    *   **Ending Position:** Usually the opposite fifth position. While a non-changing version exists, it's not the default assumption for the general term \"assemblé\".\n\n*   **D. Glissade derrière**\n    *   **Starting Position:** Fifth position (e.g., right foot front).\n    *   **Execution:** \"Glissade\" means to glide. It is a traveling, connecting step. The modifier \"derrière\" (behind) is crucial. Starting from fifth with the right foot front, the back (left) foot glides out. Weight is transferred, and the original front (right) foot closes *behind* the left foot.\n    *   **Ending Position:** The opposite fifth position (left foot front). The legs have changed.\n\n*   **E. Gargouillade**\n    *   **Starting Position:** Fifth position (e.g., right foot front).\n    *   **Execution:** This is a complex, decorative jump similar to a pas de chat, involving a rond de jambe (circular movement) from each leg while in the air. The standard execution of this step results in landing in the opposite fifth position from the start.\n    *   **Ending Position:** The opposite fifth position. The legs have changed.\n\n**Step 3: Conclude based on the analysis.**\n\nAfter analyzing each step, it's clear that `Entrechat six` is the only one on the list that, by its fundamental definition, requires the dancer to land in the identical leg position from which they started. The other steps either explicitly state a change (`changé`) or have a standard execution that results in the feet swapping their front/back placement (`derrière`, `assemblé dessus/dessous`, `gargouillade`).\n\n<<<A>>>"
