No. It is not possible. The mathematical framework of quantum mechanics (Hilbert spaces, operators) is designed to model physical systems and observables. The central concepts of GÃ¶del's proof (e.g., "positive property," "necessary existence" as a property) are abstract, metaphysical predicates from modal logic. There is no non-arbitrary way to translate these concepts into the language of quantum mechanics, making it impossible to formulate, let alone prove, the theorem within that mathematical setting. The two systems address fundamentally different domains and are conceptually incompatible.
