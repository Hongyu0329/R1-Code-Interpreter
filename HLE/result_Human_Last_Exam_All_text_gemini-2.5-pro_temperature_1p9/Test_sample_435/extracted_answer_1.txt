It would be predicted that CAR T cells manufactured in the presence of interleukin-15 would exhibit significantly increased release of key effector cytokines, such as IFN-γ and TNF-α, upon antigen stimulation compared to T cells manufactured without interleukin-15. This is because IL-15 promotes a less-differentiated, more persistent, and functionally potent memory T cell phenotype, leading to a more robust effector response upon activation.
