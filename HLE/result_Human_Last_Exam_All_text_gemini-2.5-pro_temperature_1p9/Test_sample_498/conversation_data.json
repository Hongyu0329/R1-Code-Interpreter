    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the sequence to determine the next letter.\n\n**Step 1: Initial Observation of the Sequence**\nThe sequence provided is `ZXXCVYBN_`.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Primary Pattern**\nLet's examine the letters in the sequence. We can quickly notice that most of them (`Z`, `X`, `C`, `V`, `B`, `N`) appear consecutively on the bottom row of a standard QWERTY keyboard.\n*   Bottom row of a QWERTY keyboard: `Z X C V B N M`\n\nThis suggests that the core of the sequence is based on the letters of the bottom keyboard row, read from left to right.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Anomalies**\nThe sequence is `ZXXCVYBN`. If it were just the keyboard row, it would be `ZXCVBN`. The letters that don't fit this simple pattern are the second `X` and the `Y`.\n\n**Step 4: Hypothesize a Composite Pattern Structure**\nThe sequence seems to be formed by combining two separate sequences in a regular pattern. Let's break it down:\n*   The sequence starts with `Z, X`, which are the first two letters of the keyboard's bottom row.\n*   Then, an extra `X` appears.\n*   Next are `C, V`, the next two letters of the keyboard's bottom row.\n*   Then, a `Y` appears.\n*   Finally, we have `B, N`, the next two letters of the keyboard's bottom row.\n\nThis reveals a consistent structure: \"Take two letters from the keyboard row, then add one letter from a different source.\"\n\n**Step 5: Analyze the Two Interleaved Sequences**\n*   **Sequence 1 (The Main Sequence):** The letters from the bottom row of the QWERTY keyboard.\n    *   `S1 = (Z, X, C, V, B, N, M, ...)`\n*   **Sequence 2 (The Insertion Sequence):** The letters that were inserted.\n    *   The first inserted letter is `X`.\n    *   The second inserted letter is `Y`.\n    *   This forms the sequence `X, Y, ...` which is a simple alphabetical progression. The next letter in this sequence would be `Z`.\n\n**Step 6: Combine the Patterns to Predict the Next Letter**\nLet's reconstruct the original sequence using this rule: [Take 2 from S1], [Take 1 from S2], repeat.\n\n1.  Take the first two from S1: `Z, X`\n2.  Take the first from S2: `X`\n3.  Combine: `ZXX`\n\n4.  Take the next two from S1: `C, V`\n5.  Take the next from S2: `Y`\n6.  Combine: `ZXXCVY`\n\n7.  Take the next two from S1: `B, N`\n8.  The sequence given is `ZXXCVYBN`. The next step in the pattern is to take the next letter from the insertion sequence (S2).\n\nThe next letter in S2 (`X, Y, ...`) is `Z`.\n\nTherefore, the letter that should appear next after `N` is `Z`.\n\n<<<Z>>>"
