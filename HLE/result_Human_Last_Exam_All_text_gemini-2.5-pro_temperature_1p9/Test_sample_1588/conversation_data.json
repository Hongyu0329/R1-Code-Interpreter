    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of non-zero coefficients of order 10 in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) expansion.\n\n**1. Understand the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) Formula**\n\nThe BCH formula provides an expression for Z in the equation $e^X e^Y = e^Z$, where X and Y are non-commuting entities (like matrices or elements of a Lie algebra). Z is given as a series of nested commutators of X and Y.\n\n$Z = \\log(e^X e^Y) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} Z_n(X, Y)$\n\nEach term $Z_n(X, Y)$ is a homogeneous Lie polynomial of degree n. This means it is a linear combination of all possible nested commutators of X and Y that have a total of n variables (e.g., for n=3, terms like $[X,[X,Y]]$ are included).\n\n**2. Relate \"Coefficients\" to a Basis**\n\nThe question asks for the \"number of nonzero coefficients of order 10\". This refers to the term $Z_{10}(X, Y)$. To count coefficients, we must express $Z_{10}(X, Y)$ as a linear combination of basis elements. The space of all homogeneous Lie polynomials of degree 10 in two variables (X and Y) is a vector space, which is a graded component of the free Lie algebra on two generators, denoted $L_{10}(X, Y)$.\n\nThe number of terms in the expansion is the number of basis vectors of $L_{10}(X, Y)$ that have a non-zero rational coefficient in the specific expression for $Z_{10}(X, Y)$.\n\n**3. Find the Dimension of the Space**\n\nThe first step is to find the dimension of the vector space $L_{10}(X, Y)$. This tells us the maximum possible number of non-zero coefficients. The dimension of the space of homogeneous Lie polynomials of degree *n* in *k* variables is given by Witt's formula:\n\n$dim(L_n) = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{d|n} \\mu(d) k^{n/d}$\n\nHere:\n*   n = 10 (the order we are interested in)\n*   k = 2 (the number of variables, X and Y)\n*   The sum is over all positive divisors *d* of *n*.\n*   $\\mu(d)$ is the Möbius function.\n\n**4. Apply Witt's Formula for n=10 and k=2**\n\n*   **Divisors of n=10:** The divisors are d = {1, 2, 5, 10}.\n*   **Möbius function values:** We need to find $\\mu(d)$ for each divisor:\n    *   $\\mu(1) = 1$\n    *   $\\mu(2) = -1$ (2 is a prime)\n    *   $\\mu(5) = -1$ (5 is a prime)\n    *   $\\mu(10) = \\mu(2 \\cdot 5) = \\mu(2)\\mu(5) = (-1)(-1) = 1$ (since 10 is a product of distinct primes)\n\n*   **Perform the calculation:**\n    $dim(L_{10}) = \\frac{1}{10} \\left[ \\mu(1) \\cdot 2^{10/1} + \\mu(2) \\cdot 2^{10/2} + \\mu(5) \\cdot 2^{10/5} + \\mu(10) \\cdot 2^{10/10} \\right]$\n    $dim(L_{10}) = \\frac{1}{10} \\left[ (1) \\cdot 2^{10} + (-1) \\cdot 2^{5} + (-1) \\cdot 2^{2} + (1) \\cdot 2^{1} \\right]$\n    $dim(L_{10}) = \\frac{1}{10} \\left[ 1 \\cdot 1024 - 1 \\cdot 32 - 1 \\cdot 4 + 1 \\cdot 2 \\right]$\n    $dim(L_{10}) = \\frac{1}{10} \\left[ 1024 - 32 - 4 + 2 \\right]$\n    $dim(L_{10}) = \\frac{1}{10} \\left[ 992 - 4 + 2 \\right]$\n    $dim(L_{10}) = \\frac{1}{10} \\left[ 988 + 2 \\right]$\n    $dim(L_{10}) = \\frac{1}{10} [990]$\n    $dim(L_{10}) = 99$\n\nThis calculation tells us that there are 99 linearly independent commutators of total degree 10. The term $Z_{10}(X, Y)$ is a linear combination of these 99 basis elements.\n\n**5. Check for Vanishing Coefficients**\n\nThe final and most crucial point is to determine if any of the coefficients for these 99 basis elements are actually zero. The question is not just about the dimension of the space, but about the number of terms that *actually appear* with a non-zero weight in the BCH series.\n\nA significant theorem in this area, proven by K. Goldberg in 1956, states that for $n > 1$, when the BCH series is expanded in a canonical basis (like a Hall or Lyndon basis), none of the rational coefficients are zero.\n\nTherefore, the component $Z_{10}(X, Y)$ is a sum where all 99 basis elements of $L_{10}(X, Y)$ are present with a non-zero coefficient.\n\n**6. Conclusion**\n\nThe number of non-zero coefficients of order 10 in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff expansion is equal to the dimension of the space of homogeneous Lie polynomials of degree 10 in two variables. Based on the calculation using Witt's formula, this number is 99.\n\n<<<99>>>"
