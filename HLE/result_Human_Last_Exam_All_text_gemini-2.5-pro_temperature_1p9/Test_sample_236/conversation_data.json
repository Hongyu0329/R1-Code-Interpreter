    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of elements of the homology cobordism group that can be represented by an integral surgery on a knot with at most four crossings.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem's Components\n\n1.  **Homology Cobordism Group ($\\Theta_3^H$)**: This is a group where elements are equivalence classes of oriented integral homology 3-spheres. Two such spheres, $Y_1$ and $Y_2$, are in the same class (or are homology cobordant) if the disjoint union $Y_1 \\cup -Y_2$ (where $-Y_2$ is $Y_2$ with the opposite orientation) forms the boundary of a 4-manifold $W$ that has the same integer homology as a cylinder ($S^3 \\times [0,1]$). The group operation is the connected sum (#).\n2.  **Integral Surgery on a Knot**: This is a procedure that creates a 3-manifold from $S^3$ by removing a tubular neighborhood of a knot $K$ and gluing it back differently. For the resulting manifold to be an *integral homology sphere* (i.e., its first homology group $H_1$ is trivial), the surgery coefficient must be an integer $p = \\pm 1$. The resulting manifolds are denoted $S^3_{+1}(K)$ and $S^3_{-1}(K)$.\n3.  **Knots with at most four crossings**: We need to list all knots with a crossing number of 4 or less. From standard knot tables, these are:\n    *   0 crossings: The **unknot (0_1)**.\n    *   3 crossings: The **trefoil knot (3_1)**. This knot is chiral, meaning it is distinct from its mirror image. So we must consider both the right-handed trefoil and the left-handed trefoil.\n    *   4 crossings: The **figure-eight knot (4_1)**. This knot is amphichiral, meaning it is equivalent to its mirror image.\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing the Surgeries for Each Knot\n\nWe will now examine the homology spheres generated by $\\pm 1$ surgery on each of these knots and determine their class in the homology cobordism group $\\Theta_3^H$. We will use key invariants like the Rohlin invariant ($\\mu$) and the Casson invariant ($\\lambda$) to distinguish between classes.\n\n*   $\\mu: \\Theta_3^H \\to \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$ is a homomorphism. A class $[Y]$ has order 2 if and only if $\\mu([Y])=1$.\n*   $\\lambda: \\Theta_3^H \\to \\mathbb{Z}$ is a homomorphism (on a large part of the group). $\\lambda(S^3)=0$.\n\n#### 1. The Unknot (0_1)\n\n*   Both $+1$ and $-1$ surgery on the unknot result in the standard 3-sphere, $S^3$.\n*   $S^3$ represents the identity element in the homology cobordism group.\n*   **Result**: 1 element (the identity), with invariants $(\\mu=0, \\lambda=0)$.\n\n#### 2. The Trefoil Knot (3_1)\n\nWe must consider both the right-handed trefoil ($T_R$) and the left-handed trefoil ($T_L$).\n*   **Surgery on $T_L$**:\n    *   $S^3_{+1}(T_L)$ produces the Poincaré homology sphere, often denoted $\\Sigma(2,3,5)$ or simply $P$.\n    *   $S^3_{-1}(T_L)$ also produces the Poincaré sphere $P$.\n*   **Surgery on $T_R$**:\n    *   $S^3_{+1}(T_R)$ produces the Poincaré sphere with its orientation reversed, $-\\Sigma(2,3,5)$ or $-P$.\n    *   $S^3_{-1}(T_R)$ also produces $-P$.\nSo, surgeries on the trefoil knots generate two distinct manifolds: $P$ and $-P$. Now we must determine their homology cobordism classes, $[P]$ and $[-P]$.\n*   **Invariants**: The Poincaré sphere is known to have a Rohlin invariant $\\mu(P)=1$ and Casson invariant $\\lambda(P)=0$.\n*   Since $\\mu(P)=1$, the class $[P]$ is non-trivial and has order 2 in $\\Theta_3^H$.\n*   The property of having order 2 means that $[P] + [P] = [0]$ (where [0] is the identity class), which implies $[P] = -[P]$.\n*   **Result**: Although two distinct manifolds ($P$ and $-P$) are created, they both belong to the **same** non-trivial homology cobordism class.\n*   This gives us a second element, $[P]$, with invariants $(\\mu=1, \\lambda=0)$.\n\n#### 3. The Figure-Eight Knot (4_1)\n\nThis knot is amphichiral, so we only need to consider one version.\n*   **+1 Surgery**: Let $F = S^3_{+1}(4_1)$.\n    *   The figure-eight knot has signature $\\sigma(4_1)=0$ and Arf invariant $Arf(4_1)=0$.\n    *   The Rohlin invariant is $\\mu(F) = Arf(4_1) \\pmod 2 = 0$.\n    *   The Casson invariant is $\\lambda(F) = \\Delta''_{4_1}(1)/2$. The Alexander polynomial is $\\Delta_{4_1}(t) = t^{-1} - 3 + t$. Its second derivative at $t=1$ is $\\Delta''_{4_1}(1) = 2$. Thus, $\\lambda(F) = 2/2 = 1$.\n    *   Since $\\lambda(F) = 1 \\ne 0$, the manifold $F$ represents a non-trivial element $[F]$ in $\\Theta_3^H$. Since $\\mu([F])=0$, this element has infinite order.\n*   **-1 Surgery**: The resulting manifold is $-F = S^3_{-1}(4_1)$.\n    *   Its class is $[-F]$. The invariants are $\\mu([-F])=\\mu(F)=0$ and $\\lambda([-F])=-\\lambda(F)=-1$.\n    *   Since the class $[F]$ has infinite order, it is not equal to its inverse, so $[F] \\ne [-F]$.\n*   **Result**: The figure-eight knot gives us two new, distinct elements:\n    *   A third element, $[F]$, with invariants $(\\mu=0, \\lambda=1)$.\n    *   A fourth element, $[-F]$, with invariants $(\\mu=0, \\lambda=-1)$.\n\n### Step 3: Count the Distinct Elements\n\nLet's list the distinct homology cobordism classes we have found:\n\n1.  **[S³]**: The identity element. Invariants $(\\mu=0, \\lambda=0)$. From surgery on the unknot.\n2.  **[P]**: The class of the Poincaré sphere. Invariants $(\\mu=1, \\lambda=0)$. From surgery on the trefoil knots.\n3.  **[F]**: The class from $+1$ surgery on the figure-eight knot. Invariants $(\\mu=0, \\lambda=1)$.\n4.  **[-F]**: The class from $-1$ surgery on the figure-eight knot. Invariants $(\\mu=0, \\lambda=-1)$.\n\nThese four classes are all distinct, as shown by their unique pairs of $(\\mu, \\lambda)$ invariants. Therefore, there are a total of four such elements.\n\n<<<4>>>"
