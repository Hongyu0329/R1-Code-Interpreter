    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the volume of the intersection of two cubes.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**Step 1: Understand and Define the Geometry of the Cubes**\n\n*   We have two identical cubes. Let's call them Cube A and Cube B.\n*   The side length of each cube is 1.\n*   To make the problem easy to analyze, we can place Cube A in a standard position in a 3D Cartesian coordinate system. Let's define Cube A as the set of all points (x, y, z) such that:\n    *   `0 ≤ x ≤ 1`\n    *   `0 ≤ y ≤ 1`\n    *   `0 ≤ z ≤ 1`\n*   The volume of Cube A is `1 × 1 × 1 = 1`.\n\n**Step 2: Interpret the Shift**\n\n*   The problem states that one cube is \"shifted by 1/2 along the main diagonal\" relative to the other.\n*   For Cube A at `[0,1] x [0,1] x [0,1]`, the main diagonal connects the origin `(0,0,0)` to the opposite vertex `(1,1,1)`. The vector representing this diagonal is **v** = (1, 1, 1).\n*   The phrase \"shifted by 1/2 along the main diagonal\" is best interpreted as a shift of 1/2 unit along each of the coordinate axes, which corresponds to a displacement vector of **s** = (1/2, 1/2, 1/2). This is a standard interpretation for this type of geometric problem, ensuring the resulting shape remains aligned with the axes.\n*   So, Cube B is simply Cube A translated by the vector **s**.\n\n**Step 3: Define the Geometry of the Shifted Cube**\n\n*   Cube B occupies the region found by adding the shift vector **s** = (1/2, 1/2, 1/2) to the coordinates of Cube A.\n*   The new range for each coordinate will be `[0+1/2, 1+1/2]`.\n*   Therefore, Cube B is the set of all points (x, y, z) such that:\n    *   `1/2 ≤ x ≤ 3/2`\n    *   `1/2 ≤ y ≤ 3/2`\n    *   `1/2 ≤ z ≤ 3/2`\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Shape and Dimensions of the Intersection**\n\n*   The intersection of the two cubes is the region of space that belongs to both Cube A and Cube B. To find this region, we need to find the overlap for each coordinate range.\n*   **For the x-coordinate:** The range for Cube A is `[0, 1]` and for Cube B is `[1/2, 3/2]`. The intersection of these two ranges is `[1/2, 1]`. The length of this intersection is `1 - 1/2 = 1/2`.\n*   **For the y-coordinate:** The range for Cube A is `[0, 1]` and for Cube B is `[1/2, 3/2]`. The intersection of these two ranges is `[1/2, 1]`. The length of this intersection is `1 - 1/2 = 1/2`.\n*   **For the z-coordinate:** The range for Cube A is `[0, 1]` and for Cube B is `[1/2, 3/2]`. The intersection of these two ranges is `[1/2, 1]`. The length of this intersection is `1 - 1/2 = 1/2`.\n*   The resulting intersection is a cuboid defined by `1/2 ≤ x ≤ 1`, `1/2 ≤ y ≤ 1`, and `1/2 ≤ z ≤ 1`. Since all its side lengths are equal (1/2), the intersection is itself a smaller cube.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Volume of the Intersection**\n\n*   The volume of a cube (or cuboid) is the product of its side lengths.\n*   Volume = (side length in x) × (side length in y) × (side length in z)\n*   Volume = `(1/2) × (1/2) × (1/2)`\n*   Volume = `1/8`\n\n### **Careful Points to Consider**\n\n1.  **Interpretation of the Shift:** The most critical point is correctly interpreting \"shifted by 1/2 along the main diagonal\". While it could ambiguously mean a *distance* of 1/2, the standard interpretation in this context is a component-wise shift of 1/2 along each axis that comprises the main diagonal vector. This leads to a simple, clean solution, which is typical for such problems. The alternative interpretation would result in irrational coordinates and a much more complex calculation.\n2.  **Coordinate System Setup:** Placing the first cube at the origin with its sides aligned with the coordinate axes simplifies the problem immensely. Any other placement or orientation would make finding the intersection region much harder.\n3.  **Intersection Logic:** The intersection of two cuboids aligned with the axes can be found by taking the intersection of their respective intervals on each axis independently. This breaks the 3D problem down into three simple 1D problems.\n4.  **Final Shape:** It's helpful to visualize or determine that the intersection is also a cube, which confirms the symmetry of the problem.\n\nBy following these steps and considering these points, we arrive at the final answer.\n\n<<<1/8>>>"
