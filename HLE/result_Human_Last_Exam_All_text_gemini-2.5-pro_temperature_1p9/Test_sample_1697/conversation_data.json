    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction to determine the final product.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Analyze the Starting Material**\n*   The starting compound is **N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide**.\n*   Let's break down the structure:\n    *   **Benzamide**: A benzene ring attached to a carbonyl group (C=O) which is connected to a nitrogen atom (-CONH-).\n    *   **N,N-diethyl**: Two ethyl groups (-CH₂CH₃) are attached to the nitrogen atom of the amide, making it a tertiary amide: -CON(CH₂CH₃)₂.\n    *   **3-dimethylamino**: A dimethylamino group (-N(CH₃)₂) is located at position 3 on the benzene ring, relative to the amide group which is at position 1.\n*   The structure has the following substituents on a benzene ring:\n    *   At position 1: a N,N-diethylcarboxamide group, -CONEt₂\n    *   At position 3: a dimethylamino group, -NMe₂\n    *   The remaining ring positions (2, 4, 5, 6) are initially occupied by hydrogen atoms.\n\n**2. Analyze the First Set of Reagents and Reaction Conditions**\n*   **Reagents**: sec-Butyllithium (sec-BuLi) and TMEDA (tetramethylethylenediamine).\n*   **Solvent**: THF (tetrahydrofuran).\n*   **Reaction Type**: This set of reagents is standard for **Directed Ortho-Metalation (DoM)**.\n    *   **sec-BuLi**: A very strong base that can deprotonate C-H bonds, particularly those made acidic by nearby functional groups.\n    *   **TMEDA**: A chelating agent for the lithium cation (Li⁺). It breaks down the aggregates of sec-BuLi, increasing its basicity, and coordinates to the lithium ion, which helps to position the base near a deprotonation site coordinated by a heteroatom on the substrate.\n*   **Identifying the Site of Deprotonation (Lithiation)**: We need to identify the most acidic proton on the aromatic ring. This acidity is determined by the \"directing groups\".\n    *   The starting material has two directing groups: the amide (-CONEt₂) and the amino (-NMe₂). Both groups can direct lithiation to their *ortho* positions by coordinating the lithium atom.\n    *   The **N,N-diethylcarboxamide group** is a very powerful directing group. It directs deprotonation to its ortho positions, C2 and C6.\n    *   The **dimethylamino group** is also a good directing group. It directs deprotonation to its ortho positions, C2 and C4.\n*   **Synergistic Effect**: The proton at the **C2 position** is *ortho to both* directing groups. This cooperative or synergistic effect makes the C2 proton significantly more acidic than any other proton on the ring (C4, C5, or C6). The resulting aryllithium intermediate is stabilized by chelation involving the lithium atom with both the amide's carbonyl oxygen and the amino's nitrogen.\n*   **Conclusion of Step 1**: The sec-BuLi will selectively deprotonate the C2 position to form an aryllithium intermediate.\n\n**3. Analyze the Second Reagent and Reaction**\n*   **Reagent**: Methyl iodide (CH₃I).\n*   **Reaction Type**: The aryllithium formed in the first step is a potent nucleophile (a carbanion). Methyl iodide is an excellent electrophile for SN2 reactions.\n*   **Mechanism**: The nucleophilic carbon at C2 of the aryllithium attacks the electrophilic methyl carbon of CH₃I. The iodide ion (I⁻) acts as the leaving group. This reaction is often called an \"electrophilic quench\" or \"trapping\" of the organometallic intermediate.\n\n**4. Determine the Final Product**\n*   The lithiation at C2 followed by methylation results in the replacement of the hydrogen atom at C2 with a methyl group (-CH₃).\n*   The core structure of N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide remains intact.\n*   The final product is therefore **N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide**.\n\n### Summary of Careful Points\n*   **Correctly identify both directing groups:** -CONEt₂ and -NMe₂.\n*   **Recognize the reaction as Directed Ortho-Metalation:** The combination of a strong organolithium base (sec-BuLi) and a chelating agent (TMEDA) is a classic recipe for this reaction.\n*   **Determine the most reactive site:** The C2 position is doubly activated (synergistic effect) as it is ortho to both directing groups, making it the exclusive site of deprotonation.\n*   **Identify the role of the second reagent:** Methyl iodide is an electrophile that alkylates the nucleophilic carbanion formed in the first step.\n*   **Combine the steps to draw the final structure:** Place a methyl group at the C2 position of the starting material's aromatic ring.\n\nThe compound obtained is N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide.\n\n<<<N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide>>>"
