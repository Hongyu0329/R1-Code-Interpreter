    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the first winner of the Academy Award for Best Picture to depict a Luxor Obelisk on-screen.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Key Elements of the Question**\n\n*   **\"Academy Award for Best Picture\":** We need to consider the official list of winners for this specific category, in chronological order.\n*   **\"First winner\":** The crucial part is identifying the earliest film on that list that meets the criteria.\n*   **\"depict... on-screen\":** The obelisk must be visually present in the film, not just mentioned or part of the setting in theory.\n*   **\"a Luxor Obelisk\":** This is a very specific detail. There are two obelisks originally from the Luxor Temple in Egypt. One remains in Luxor, Egypt. The other was transported to Paris, France, in the 1830s and now stands in the center of the Place de la Concorde. Therefore, a film showing either of these locations would qualify.\n\n**Step 2: List Potential Candidates by Chronological Order and Setting**\n\nWe will scan the list of Best Picture winners, starting from the first awards (1927/1928), and flag any that have settings in Paris or Egypt.\n\n*   **1920s-1930s:**\n    *   *The Life of Emile Zola* (won for 1937): Set in Paris. This is a potential candidate. However, the film focuses on historical events like the Dreyfus affair, which was centered at the Ã‰cole Militaire, not the Place de la Concorde. A visual review confirms the obelisk is not shown.\n\n*   **1940s:**\n    *   *Casablanca* (won for 1942): Features famous flashback sequences in Paris. While these scenes show iconic locations like the Arc de Triomphe, the montage does not include a clear depiction of the Place de la Concorde or its obelisk.\n\n*   **1950s:**\n    This decade provides several strong candidates set in Paris.\n    *   ***An American in Paris*** (won for 1951): The film is a musical romance set entirely in Paris. Its famous 17-minute climactic ballet sequence is an artistic tour of the city, styled after the works of famous French painters. In the portion inspired by painter Raoul Dufy, there is a clear and stylized depiction of the Place de la Concorde, with the Luxor Obelisk featured prominently in the center. This is a confirmed visual depiction.\n    *   ***Around the World in 80 Days*** (won for 1956): This film's global journey includes a stop in Paris. However, it was released five years after *An American in Paris*. Even if it showed the obelisk, it would not be the *first*.\n    *   ***Gigi*** (won for 1958): This film is also set in Paris and features many outdoor scenes. However, having won for 1958, it comes after *An American in Paris*.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Egyptian Obelisk Possibility**\n\nNow, we must consider if any film showed the obelisk in Luxor, Egypt, *before* 1951.\n*   Reviewing the list of Best Picture winners before 1951 (e.g., *Wings*, *Gone with the Wind*, *Rebecca*, *The Best Years of Our Lives*), none have a setting in Egypt that would include a depiction of the Luxor Temple.\n*   Major epics set in ancient Egypt, like *The Ten Commandments* (1956) or *Cleopatra* (1963), either did not win Best Picture or were released after 1951.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude the Findings**\n\nBased on the chronological review, no Best Picture winner prior to 1951 features an on-screen depiction of either the Luxor Obelisk in Paris or the one in Luxor. The first film to do so is *An American in Paris*, which won the award for 1951. It clearly shows the obelisk located in the Place de la Concorde during its final ballet sequence.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n1.  **The existence of two Luxor Obelisks:** The query could be satisfied by a film showing the obelisk in Paris *or* Luxor. This broadens the search but ultimately leads to Paris being the first depicted location.\n2.  **Visual Confirmation vs. Setting:** A film being \"set\" in Paris is not enough. The landmark must actually appear on screen, which is a key distinction for movies like *Casablanca*.\n3.  **Chronological Order is Paramount:** The question is about the \"first\" winner, making the year of the win the most critical sorting factor. Later films, no matter how prominently they feature the obelisk, are irrelevant once the first one is found.\n4.  **Stylized Depictions Count:** The obelisk in *An American in Paris* is part of an artistic, painted backdrop within a ballet sequence, not a live-action shot of the actual location. This still counts as a depiction.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nThe process definitively identifies *An American in Paris* (1951) as the first Best Picture winner to show a Luxor Obelisk (the one in Paris).\n\n<<<An American in Paris"
