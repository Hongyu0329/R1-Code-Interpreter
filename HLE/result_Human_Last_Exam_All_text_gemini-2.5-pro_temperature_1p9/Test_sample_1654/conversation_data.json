    "To analyze this question, we must carefully examine Anton Chekhov's short story \"The Chameleon\" and count every instance where the main character Otchumyelov's coat is mentioned or becomes a point of action. The coat's handling is a key literary device used to symbolize his rapidly changing attitude based on the perceived social status of the dog's owner.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of each time the coat is described or mentioned:\n\n1.  **Initial Description:** At the very beginning of the story, Chekhov introduces the Police Superintendent and his attire.\n    *   **Quote:** \"Police Superintendent Otchumyelov is walking across the market-square. He is wearing a **new greatcoat** and carrying a parcel under his arm.\"\n    *   **Analysis:** This is the first mention. It establishes his official, authoritative presence.\n\n2.  **First Action - Taking it Off:** As Otchumyelov gets worked up by the initial incident and believes the dog's owner is insignificant, he complains about the heat.\n    *   **Quote:** \"Come, **take off my coat**, Yeldyrin... It's frightfully hot!\"\n    *   **Analysis:** This is the second mention. Removing the coat symbolizes him shedding his formal authority to deal with what he assumes is a trivial matter involving commoners. He feels flustered and overheated.\n\n3.  **Second Action - Putting it On:** The moment someone in the crowd suggests the dog belongs to the powerful General Zhigalov, Otchumyelov's demeanor changes instantly.\n    *   **Quote:** \"Help **me on with my coat**, Yeldyrin, my lad... The wind's getting up... I am cold.\"\n    *   **Analysis:** This is the third mention. The sudden \"chill\" is a physical manifestation of his fear and subservience to authority. He needs to put the coat back on to regain his sense of official composure and show respect.\n\n4.  **Third Action - Taking it Off Again:** When the policeman suggests that the dog is not the General's, Otchumyelov reverses his position again.\n    *   **Quote:** \"**Take my coat off**, my lad... It's soffocating!\"\n    *   **Analysis:** This is the fourth mention. His false authority returns, and with it, the feeling of being \"hot\" and oppressed by the coat now that he thinks he's dealing with an inferior again.\n\n5.  **Fourth Action - Putting it On Again:** The situation shifts once more when it is suggested the dog belongs to the General's brother. This is still a connection to power.\n    *   **Quote:** \"**Put my coat on**, brother Yeldyrin... There seems to be a wind getting up.\"\n    *   **Analysis:** This is the fifth mention. His fear of offending someone important makes him \"cold\" again, and he retreats back into the formality and protection of his greatcoat.\n\n6.  **Final Description:** After the matter is settled in favor of the General's brother, Otchumyelov walks away. Chekhov gives us a final image of him.\n    *   **Quote:** \"He wraps **his greatcoat** more closely about him and... goes on his way through the market-square.\"\n    *   **Analysis:** This is the sixth and final mention. He wraps the coat tightly, symbolizing his retreat back into his secure, official, and cowardly shell, having successfully navigated the socially dangerous situation.\n\nBy counting each distinct time Chekhov uses the coat to describe Otchumyelov's changing state of mind, we arrive at a total of six instances.\n\n<<<6>>>"
