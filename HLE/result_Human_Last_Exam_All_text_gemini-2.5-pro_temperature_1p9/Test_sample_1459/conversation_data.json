    "Answering this question involves finding the Gromov-Hausdorff distance, denoted $d_{GH}(X,Y)$, between two specific metric spaces:\n1.  **Space X**: The closed interval $[0,1]$ with the standard absolute value metric, $d_X(x_1, x_2) = |x_1 - x_2|$.\n2.  **Space Y**: The unit circle $S^1$ with its intrinsic metric, which is the shortest arc-length distance. The circumference of the unit circle is $2\\pi$.\n\nThe Gromov-Hausdorff distance can be defined using correspondences. A correspondence is a relation $R \\subseteq X \\times Y$ such that for every $x \\in X$, there is a $y \\in Y$ with $(x,y) \\in R$, and for every $y \\in Y$, there is an $x \\in X$ with $(x,y) \\in R$. The distortion of a correspondence $R$ is given by:\n$\\text{dis}(R) = \\sup_{(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2) \\in R} |d_X(x_1, x_2) - d_Y(y_1, y_2)|$.\n\nThe Gromov-Hausdorff distance is then given by:\n$d_{GH}(X, Y) = \\frac{1}{2} \\inf_R \\text{dis}(R)$,\nwhere the infimum is taken over all possible correspondences $R$ between $X$ and $Y$.\n\nTo find the value of $d_{GH}(X,Y)$, we can establish an upper bound and a lower bound. If these bounds match, we have found the exact distance.\n\n**Step 1: Finding an Upper Bound**\n\nWe can find an upper bound by constructing a specific correspondence and calculating its distortion. Consider the \"folding\" correspondence $R_{fold}$, which relates points in the interval to points on the circle by \"folding\" the interval at its midpoint.\n\nLet a point on the circle $S^1$ be denoted by $y(\\theta)$, where $\\theta \\in [0, 2\\pi)$ is the angle in radians. The correspondence $R_{fold}$ is defined as:\n$R_{fold} = \\{(x, y) \\in [0,1] \\times S^1 \\mid y = y(2\\pi x) \\text{ or } y = y(-2\\pi x)\\}$.\n\nLet's check that this is indeed a correspondence:\n*   For any $x \\in [0,1]$, the pairs $(x, y(2\\pi x))$ and $(x, y(-2\\pi x))$ are in $R_{fold}$. So every point in $X$ is related to some point in $Y$.\n*   For any $y(\\theta) \\in S^1$, we can find $x_1 = \\theta/(2\\pi) \\in [0,1)$ and $x_2 = 1-\\theta/(2\\pi) \\in (0,1]$. Then $(x_1, y(2\\pi x_1)) = (x_1, y(\\theta))$ is in $R_{fold}$, and $(x_2, y(-2\\pi x_2)) = (x_2, y(-2\\pi+\\theta))=(x_2, y(\\theta))$ is in $R_{fold}$. So every point in $Y$ is related to some point in $X$.\n\nNow, we calculate the distortion of $R_{fold}$. We need to find the supremum of $|d_X(x_1, x_2) - d_Y(y_1, y_2)|$ over all pairs of points $(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2) \\in R_{fold}$.\n\nConsider the following two points in $R_{fold}$:\n*   Let $(x_1, y_1) = (1/4, y(2\\pi \\cdot 1/4)) = (1/4, y(\\pi/2))$.\n*   Let $(x_2, y_2) = (1/4, y(-2\\pi \\cdot 1/4)) = (1/4, y(-\\pi/2))$.\n\nThe distance between the points in $X$ is $d_X(x_1, x_2) = |1/4 - 1/4| = 0$.\nThe distance between the corresponding points in $Y$ is the distance between $y(\\pi/2)$ and $y(-\\pi/2)$, which are antipodal points on the circle. The arc-length distance is $\\pi$. So, $d_Y(y_1, y_2) = \\pi$.\n\nThe distortion for this specific choice of points is:\n$|d_X(x_1, x_2) - d_Y(y_1, y_2)| = |0 - \\pi| = \\pi$.\n\nSince the distortion of the correspondence is the supremum over all pairs, it must be at least $\\pi$.\n$\\text{dis}(R_{fold}) \\ge \\pi$.\nIn fact, it can be shown that the distortion is exactly $\\pi$. This provides an upper bound for the Gromov-Hausdorff distance:\n$d_{GH}(X, Y) \\le \\frac{1}{2} \\text{dis}(R_{fold}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\pi = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\n\n**Step 2: Finding a Lower Bound**\n\nTo find a lower bound, we use a topological argument. A known result (a consequence of the Borsuk-Ulam theorem adapted for correspondences) states that for any correspondence $R$ between the interval $[0,1]$ and the circle $S^1$, there must exist a point $x \\in [0,1]$ which is related to a pair of antipodal points on the circle.\n\nThat is, for any correspondence $R$, there exists an $x_0 \\in [0,1]$ and a $y_0 \\in S^1$ such that both $(x_0, y_0) \\in R$ and $(x_0, -y_0) \\in R$, where $-y_0$ is the antipode of $y_0$.\n\nLet's calculate the contribution of this pair of points to the distortion of any such correspondence $R$.\nLet $(x_1, y_1) = (x_0, y_0)$ and $(x_2, y_2) = (x_0, -y_0)$.\n*   The distance in $X$ is $d_X(x_1, x_2) = |x_0 - x_0| = 0$.\n*   The distance in $Y$ is $d_Y(y_1, y_2) = d_Y(y_0, -y_0) = \\pi$.\n\nThe distortion contribution is $|d_X(x_1, x_2) - d_Y(y_1, y_2)| = |0 - \\pi| = \\pi$.\nThis implies that for *any* correspondence $R$, its distortion must be at least $\\pi$:\n$\\text{dis}(R) \\ge \\pi$.\n\nSince this holds for all correspondences, the infimum over all of them must also be at least $\\pi$.\n$\\inf_R \\text{dis}(R) \\ge \\pi$.\n\nUsing the formula for the Gromov-Hausdorff distance, we get the lower bound:\n$d_{GH}(X, Y) = \\frac{1}{2} \\inf_R \\text{dis}(R) \\ge \\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\n\n**Step 3: Conclusion**\n\nFrom Step 1, we found an upper bound: $d_{GH}(X, Y) \\le \\pi/2$.\nFrom Step 2, we found a lower bound: $d_{GH}(X, Y) \\ge \\pi/2$.\n\nSince the upper bound and the lower bound are equal, we can conclude the exact value of the Gromov-Hausdorff distance.\n\n$d_{GH}([0,1], S^1) = \\pi/2$."
