    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rarest noble gas on Earth.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Noble Gases**\nFirst, we need to list the elements that are classified as noble gases. These are the elements in Group 18 of the periodic table. In order of increasing atomic number, they are:\n*   Helium (He)\n*   Neon (Ne)\n*   Argon (Ar)\n*   Krypton (Kr)\n*   Xenon (Xe)\n*   Radon (Rn)\n*   Oganesson (Og)\n\n**Careful Point:** Oganesson is a purely synthetic element created in laboratories. It does not exist naturally on Earth and is extremely unstable. Therefore, it should be excluded from consideration as part of Earth's \"terrestrial matter\" in 2002.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Scope of \"Terrestrial Matter\" and Abundance**\nThe question asks for the rarest gas as a \"percentage of all terrestrial matter.\" This includes the Earth's atmosphere, crust, mantle, and core. However, the noble gases are, by definition, gases under standard conditions and are chemically inert. Their primary reservoir on Earth is the atmosphere. While some are trapped in the crust or mantle, their relative abundances are best compared by looking at their well-documented atmospheric concentrations. Comparing their concentrations in the atmosphere will accurately reflect their overall relative rarity on Earth. The specific year, 2002, does not significantly impact the abundances of these elements, which are stable over geological timescales (with the exception of Radon).\n\n**Step 3: Compare the Abundances of Stable Noble Gases**\nLet's look at the typical concentrations of the stable (non-radioactive) noble gases in the Earth's dry atmosphere, measured in parts per million (ppm) by volume:\n*   **Argon (Ar):** ~9,340 ppm (or 0.934%). This is by far the most abundant noble gas.\n*   **Neon (Ne):** ~18.18 ppm.\n*   **Helium (He):** ~5.24 ppm.\n*   **Krypton (Kr):** ~1.14 ppm.\n*   **Xenon (Xe):** ~0.087 ppm.\n\n**Careful Point:** Among the stable noble gases, Xenon (Xe) is clearly the rarest. The next step is to compare it to the remaining noble gas, Radon.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze Radon (Rn)**\nRadon is fundamentally different from the other noble gases because it is radioactive.\n*   **Source:** It is not a primordial element from the Earth's formation. Instead, it is continuously generated by the radioactive decay of uranium and thorium found in the Earth's crust.\n*   **Stability:** Its most stable isotope, Radon-222, has a very short half-life of only 3.8 days.\n*   **Abundance:** Because it decays so quickly after being formed, its average concentration in the atmosphere is extraordinarily low. Its concentration is highly variable but is typically measured in atoms per liter of air, not ppm. The average concentration is on the order of 1 part per quintillion (10^21), which is about 1 x 10⁻¹⁵ ppm.\n\n**Step 5: Final Comparison and Conclusion**\nWe need to compare the abundance of the rarest stable noble gas, Xenon, with the abundance of Radon.\n*   **Xenon (Xe) abundance:** ~0.087 ppm = 8.7 x 10⁻⁸ (as a fraction of the atmosphere)\n*   **Radon (Rn) abundance:** ~1 x 10⁻¹⁵ ppm = 1 x 10⁻²¹ (as a fraction of the atmosphere)\n\nComparing these two values, Radon's concentration is more than a trillion times smaller than Xenon's. Even though the question asks for a percentage of *all terrestrial matter*, this scaling factor applies to all gases and does not change their relative rarity. The extremely short half-life of Radon ensures that its total amount on Earth at any given time is minuscule compared to any other noble gas.\n\nTherefore, Radon was the rarest noble gas on Earth in 2002.\n\n<<<Radon>>>"
