    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Reactants and Reagent**\n*   **Substrate:** (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane. This is a chiral secondary alkyl halide on a cyclohexane ring.\n*   **Reagent/Solvent:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK) in tert-butyl alcohol (t-BuOH). Potassium tert-butoxide is a strong, sterically bulky base. Tert-butyl alcohol is a polar protic solvent, often used with its conjugate base.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Reaction Type**\n*   The reaction of a secondary alkyl halide with a strong, bulky base strongly favors an **E2 (bimolecular elimination)** reaction. Substitution (SN2/SN1) is disfavored. SN2 is hindered by the secondary carbon and the bulky base. SN1/E1 would require carbocation formation, which is less likely with a strong base that promotes a concerted E2 pathway.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Stereochemistry of the Substrate**\n*   To predict the outcome of an E2 reaction on a cyclohexane ring, we must first determine the relative stereochemistry (cis or trans) of the substituents. We need to find the spatial arrangement for the (1S, 2R) stereoisomer.\n*   Let's draw a cyclohexane ring and place the substituents. For a 1,2-disubstituted cyclohexane, the (1S, 2R) configuration corresponds to the **cis** isomer (where both substituents are on the same face of the ring, e.g., both \"up\" or both \"down\").\n*   So, our substrate is *cis*-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane.\n\n**Step 4: Draw the Chair Conformations**\n*   Cyclohexane rings exist as rapidly interconverting chair conformations. For a cis-1,2-disubstituted cyclohexane, one conformer will have the substituents in (axial, equatorial) positions, and the other will have them in (equatorial, axial) positions.\n    *   **Conformer A:** Bromine is axial (ax), and the methyl group is equatorial (eq).\n    *   **Conformer B:** Bromine is equatorial (eq), and the methyl group is axial (ax).\n*   **Stability:** Conformer A is more stable than Conformer B because the larger methyl group occupies the less crowded equatorial position. The equilibrium will favor Conformer A.\n\n**Step 5: Apply the Requirement for E2 Elimination**\n*   A crucial requirement for the E2 mechanism in a cyclohexane ring is that the leaving group (Bromine) and the hydrogen being removed (β-hydrogen) must be in a **trans-diaxial** (anti-periplanar) arrangement.\n*   This means the reaction can only proceed from the conformation where the bromine atom is in an **axial** position.\n*   Therefore, the reaction must occur via **Conformer A** (Br is axial, CH₃ is equatorial).\n\n**Step 6: Identify Possible β-Hydrogens for Elimination**\n*   In Conformer A, the bromine is axial on C1. We look for axial hydrogens on the adjacent carbons (β-carbons), C2 and C6.\n    *   **At C2:** The methyl group is equatorial. This means the hydrogen on C2 is **axial**. This hydrogen is trans-diaxial to the bromine and is available for elimination.\n    *   **At C6:** This carbon has two hydrogens. One is axial and one is equatorial. The **axial** hydrogen is trans-diaxial to the bromine and is also available for elimination.\n\n**Step 7: Predict the Regioselectivity (Major Product)**\n*   Since there are two different β-hydrogens that meet the stereochemical requirement, two different products are possible.\n    *   **Pathway 1 (Zaitsev):** If the base removes the axial hydrogen from C2, the double bond forms between C1 and C2. The product is **1-methylcyclohexene** (a trisubstituted, more stable alkene).\n    *   **Pathway 2 (Hofmann):** If the base removes the axial hydrogen from C6, the double bond forms between C1 and C6. The product is **3-methylcyclohexene** (a disubstituted, less stable alkene).\n*   The choice between these pathways is determined by the base. Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK) is a **sterically bulky base**. Bulky bases have difficulty accessing sterically hindered protons.\n    *   The proton on C2 is more sterically hindered than the proton on C6.\n    *   Therefore, the bulky base will preferentially remove the more accessible proton from C6.\n*   This means the major product will be the less substituted alkene, the Hofmann product.\n\n**Step 8: Identify the Final Product**\n*   The major product of the reaction is formed via elimination of the proton from C6.\n*   The name of this product is **3-methylcyclohexene**.\n\n<<<3-methylcyclohexene>>>"
