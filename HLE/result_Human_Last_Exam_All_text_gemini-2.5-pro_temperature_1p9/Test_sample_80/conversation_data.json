    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Total Number of Edge Squares**\n\nAn 8x8 chessboard has a total of 64 squares. The \"edge squares\" are those on the first rank, eighth rank, 'a' file, and 'h' file.\n*   The top row (8th rank) has 8 squares.\n*   The bottom row (1st rank) has 8 squares.\n*   The left column ('a' file) has 8 squares.\n*   The right column ('h' file) has 8 squares.\n\nIf we simply add these (8 + 8 + 8 + 8 = 32), we double-count the four corner squares (a1, h1, a8, h8). To get the correct total, we subtract the corners we've counted twice.\n*   Total Edge Squares = (8 + 8 + 6 + 6) = 28.\n*   Alternatively: (8 * 4) - 4 = 28.\n\nSo, there are 28 edge squares available for placing bishops.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Constraint of Placing Bishops**\n\nThe goal is to place as many bishops as possible on these 28 squares so that no bishop attacks another.\n*   A bishop moves and attacks along diagonals.\n*   A crucial property of a bishop is that it always stays on squares of the same color. A bishop on a white square can only ever move to and attack pieces on other white squares. The same applies to bishops on black squares.\n*   Therefore, to place the maximum number of non-attacking bishops, we can place them all on squares of the same color. If all bishops are on white squares, none can attack another. If all are on black squares, none can attack another.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Color Distribution of the Edge Squares**\n\nWe need to find out how many of the 28 edge squares are white and how many are black. On a standard chessboard, the colors of the squares are perfectly balanced.\n*   Total squares on the board: 64 (32 white, 32 black).\n*   Total edge squares: 28.\n*   Due to the alternating pattern, the 28 edge squares are also perfectly balanced. There are **14 white edge squares** and **14 black edge squares**.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Maximum Number of Bishops**\n\nTo place the maximum number of non-attacking bishops on the edge, we should choose one color and occupy all the edge squares of that color.\n*   We can place one bishop on each of the 14 white edge squares. No bishop will attack another.\n*   Alternatively, we can place one bishop on each of the 14 black edge squares. Again, no bishop will attack another.\n*   Therefore, the maximum number of bishops that can be successfully placed is **14**.\n\n**Step 5: Find the Number of Empty Edge Squares**\n\nThe question asks for the number of edge squares that would lack bishops, not the number of bishops placed.\n*   Total number of edge squares: 28\n*   Maximum number of bishops placed: 14\n*   Number of empty edge squares = Total edge squares - Number of placed bishops\n*   Number of empty edge squares = 28 - 14 = 14\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n1.  **Counting Edge Squares:** Be sure not to double-count the four corner squares when calculating the total number of edge squares.\n2.  **Bishop's Rule:** The key insight is that bishops on squares of the same color can never attack each other. This is the fundamental principle for maximizing their number on the board.\n3.  **The Question:** Pay close attention to the final question. It asks for the number of *empty* squares, not the number of bishops.\n4.  **Color Symmetry:** The board's symmetry simplifies the problem. Knowing there are an equal number of white and black edge squares is a helpful shortcut.\n\nBy placing bishops on all 14 edge squares of one color (e.g., white), the other 14 edge squares (of the opposite color, black) will remain empty.\n\n<<<14>>>"
