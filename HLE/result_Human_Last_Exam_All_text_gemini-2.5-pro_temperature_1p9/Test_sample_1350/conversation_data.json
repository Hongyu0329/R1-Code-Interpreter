    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe core components of the question are:\n*   **Text:** William Morris's *The House of the Wolfings*.\n*   **Action 1:** A character visited a Roman city.\n*   **Action 2:** This character describes the religious practices of the Romans.\n*   **Key Detail:** The description contains a clear reference to the myth of Romulus and Remus (founders of Rome, famously suckled by a she-wolf).\n*   **Goal:** Identify the name of this character.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Potential Candidates**\nThe narrative of *The House of the Wolfings* focuses on the Gothic Wolfing tribe's conflict with the Roman army. The main characters include:\n*   **Thiodolf:** The war-leader of the Wolfings. His story is central, but it's primarily focused on his leadership and a magical hauberk (mail shirt).\n*   **Hall-Sun (also known as the Wood-Sun):** Thiodolf's foster-daughter, a maiden of the tribe who is also a divine being. Her focus is on her love for Thiodolf and the moral dilemma of the hauberk.\n*   **Otter:** The brother of a previous chieftain and a wise, well-traveled elder of the tribe. His role often involves providing counsel and historical context.\n\nGiven the requirement for a character who has traveled to Roman lands and observed their culture, Otter is the most likely candidate. He is presented as someone who has ventured beyond the lands of the Wolfings.\n\n**Step 3: Locate the Relevant Passage in the Text**\nWe need to find the specific scene where a character recounts their travels and describes Roman customs. This occurs in Chapter VII, titled \"Otter Addresses the Folk.\" In this chapter, Otter speaks to the assembled tribe to rally them against the approaching Roman legions.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Character's Speech for the Key Details**\nIn his speech, Otter describes the Romans to his fellow tribespeople. He directly confirms that he has visited their cities and observed their religion.\n\n*   **Confirmation of Visit:** Otter says, \"I have been in their cities and their temples, and I have seen their altars...\" This satisfies the first part of the question.\n*   **Description of Religious Practices (Romulus and Remus):** He then describes what he saw on those altars: \"...what have I seen? An Altar of the Wolf, and the she-wolf giving suck to the man-cubs.\"\n*   **Careful Point - The Connection:** The phrase \"she-wolf giving suck to the man-cubs\" is a direct and unmistakable reference to the Roman foundation myth of Romulus and Remus being nursed by the Capitoline Wolf. Readers, especially in Morris's time, would have instantly recognized this iconic image of Roman identity.\n*   **Careful Point - The Thematic Irony:** Otter uses this observation to create a powerful rhetorical point. He asks his people, \"What say ye to it, children of the Wolf?\" He contrasts the Wolfings, who have a real, living connection to the wolf as their totem, with the Romans, who in his view only have a \"painted image\" of the beast on an altar.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude the Analysis**\nThe character who fulfills all the conditions set out in the question is Otter. He is the one who traveled to a Roman city, saw their religious art, and described the scene of the she-wolf nursing human babies, which is the core of the Romulus and Remus legend.\n\n<<<Otter>>>"
