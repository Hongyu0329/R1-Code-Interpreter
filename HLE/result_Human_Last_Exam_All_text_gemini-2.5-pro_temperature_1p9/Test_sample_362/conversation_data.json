    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the Wittig reaction to determine the final product.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Identify the Reactants**\n\n*   **Carbonyl Compound:** The first reactant is **pivalaldehyde**. Its systematic IUPAC name is 2,2-dimethylpropanal. The structure consists of a formyl group (-CHO) attached to a tert-butyl group (-C(CH₃)₃).\n    *   Structure: (CH₃)₃C-CHO\n*   **Wittig Reagent (Phosphorus Ylide):** The second reactant is **(2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ⁵-phosphane**. This is a phosphorus ylide.\n    *   `triphenyl-λ⁵-phosphane`: Indicates a phosphorus atom double-bonded to a carbon atom and single-bonded to three phenyl groups (Ph₃P=).\n    *   `(2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)`: This describes the group attached to the phosphorus via the double bond. \"Ethylidene\" is a two-carbon group (=CH-CH₃). The substituent \"2-(2-chlorophenyl)\" is on the second carbon of this group.\n    *   Structure: Ph₃P=CH-CH₂-(C₆H₄Cl), where the substituent on the benzene ring is at position 2 (ortho).\n\n**2. Understand the Wittig Reaction Mechanism**\n\nThe Wittig reaction is a powerful method for synthesizing alkenes. The core transformation involves the reaction of an aldehyde or a ketone with a phosphorus ylide. The oxygen atom of the carbonyl group and the triphenylphosphine group of the ylide are swapped, forming a carbon-carbon double bond and triphenylphosphine oxide as a stable byproduct.\n\nThe general reaction is:\nR¹R²C=O + Ph₃P=CR³R⁴  →  R¹R²C=CR³R⁴ + Ph₃P=O\n\n**3. Apply the Reaction to the Specific Reactants**\n\nWe will combine the carbon part of the aldehyde with the carbon part of the ylide.\n*   From pivalaldehyde, we take the `(CH₃)₃C-CH=` part.\n*   From the ylide, we take the `=CH-CH₂-(2-chlorophenyl)` part.\n\nConnecting these two fragments forms the basic structure of the alkene product:\n(CH₃)₃C-CH=CH-CH₂-(2-chlorophenyl)\n\n**4. Analyze the Stereochemistry of the Product**\n\nA new double bond is formed. We must determine if E/Z isomers are possible and which one would be the major product.\n\n*   **Substituents on the double bond:**\n    *   On the carbon from pivalaldehyde: a Hydrogen atom (H) and a tert-butyl group ((CH₃)₃C).\n    *   On the carbon from the ylide: a Hydrogen atom (H) and a 2-chlorobenzyl group (-CH₂-C₆H₄Cl).\n*   Since each carbon of the double bond has two different substituents, E/Z isomerism is possible.\n\n*   **Predicting the major isomer:** The stereochemical outcome of a Wittig reaction depends on the stability of the ylide.\n    *   **Stabilized ylides** (with electron-withdrawing groups like -C=O, -CN on the ylidic carbon) typically give the (E)-alkene (thermodynamic control).\n    *   **Unstabilized ylides** (with alkyl or hydrogen groups on the ylidic carbon) typically give the (Z)-alkene as the major product (kinetic control).\n*   Our ylide, Ph₃P=CH-CH₂-(2-chlorophenyl), has an alkyl-type group (2-chlorobenzyl) attached to the ylidic carbon. There are no groups that can stabilize the negative charge of the carbanion precursor via resonance. Therefore, it is an **unstabilized ylide**.\n*   **Conclusion:** The reaction will preferentially form the **(Z)-alkene**.\n\n**5. Determine and Name the Final Product**\n\nTo confirm the (Z) configuration, we use the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules.\n\n*   On the `(CH₃)₃C-CH=` carbon: The tert-butyl group has higher priority than the hydrogen atom.\n*   On the `=CH-CH₂-(2-chlorophenyl)` carbon: The 2-chlorobenzyl group has higher priority than the hydrogen atom.\n\nIn the **(Z)-isomer**, the two high-priority groups (tert-butyl and 2-chlorobenzyl) are on the **same side** of the double bond.\n\nFinally, we name the product using IUPAC nomenclature:\n1.  Find the longest carbon chain containing the double bond: This is a 5-carbon chain (pentene).\n    `C₅-C₄(CH₃)₂-C₃H=C₂H-C₁H₂-(2-chlorophenyl)`\n2.  Number the chain to give the double bond the lowest possible locant. Numbering from the phenyl side gives the double bond at C2 (`pent-2-ene`).\n3.  Identify and name the substituents: a `2-chlorophenyl` group at C1, and two `methyl` groups at C4.\n4.  Combine the parts: `1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene`.\n5.  Add the stereochemical descriptor: `(Z)`.\n\nThe major product of the reaction is **(Z)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene**."
