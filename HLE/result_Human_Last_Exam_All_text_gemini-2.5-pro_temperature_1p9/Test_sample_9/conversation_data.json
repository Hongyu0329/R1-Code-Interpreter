    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the first homology group $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z})$ of the moduli space $X$ of nondegenerate lattices in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ with unit area.\n\n**Step 1: Define the space X mathematically**\n\n*   A **lattice** $\\Lambda$ in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ is a discrete subgroup of rank 2. It can be defined by a basis $\\{v_1, v_2\\}$ of $\\mathbb{R}^2$, as $\\Lambda = \\mathbb{Z}v_1 + \\mathbb{Z}v_2$.\n*   We can represent such a basis by a matrix $A = (v_1 | v_2)$, whose columns are the basis vectors. Since the lattice is **nondegenerate**, $v_1$ and $v_2$ are linearly independent, so $A \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{R})$.\n*   The **area** of the fundamental parallelogram of the lattice is given by $|\\det(A)|$. The condition of **unit area** means $|\\det(A)| = 1$. The set of such matrices is $SL^{\\pm}(2, \\mathbb{R}) = \\{A \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{R}) : \\det(A) = \\pm 1\\}$.\n*   Two bases, represented by matrices $A_1$ and $A_2$, define the same lattice if they are related by a change of basis over the integers. This means $A_2 = A_1 M$ for some matrix $M \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$, the group of integer matrices with determinant $\\pm 1$.\n*   Therefore, the space of all unit-area lattices is the quotient space $\\mathcal{L} = SL^{\\pm}(2, \\mathbb{R}) / GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n*   The term **\"moduli space\"** implies that we should identify lattices that are equivalent under isometries of the ambient space $\\mathbb{R}^2$. The group of linear isometries (which preserve the origin) is the orthogonal group $O(2)$. The action of an isometry $k \\in O(2)$ on a lattice $\\Lambda$ defined by a basis matrix $A$ transforms it to a new lattice $k\\Lambda$ with basis matrix $kA$.\n*   Thus, the moduli space $X$ is the space of orbits of $\\mathcal{L}$ under the action of $O(2)$. This is the double quotient space:\n    $X = O(2) \\backslash SL^{\\pm}(2, \\mathbb{R}) / GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\n**Step 2: Simplify the space X**\n\n*   First, we can simplify the space $SL^{\\pm}(2, \\mathbb{R})$. Let $g \\in SL^{\\pm}(2, \\mathbb{R})$. If $\\det(g)=-1$, we can write $g=g'j$ where $j=\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$ and $g' \\in SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$.\n*   Since $j \\in O(2)$ and also $j \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$, for any element represented by $g \\in SL^\\pm(2,\\mathbb{R})$, its equivalence class $[g]$ in $X$ is the same as the class of $[gj^{-1}]$. If $\\det(g)=-1$, then $\\det(gj^{-1})=1$. This means every orbit in $X$ has a representative in $SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$.\n*   Therefore, we can restrict the middle group to $SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$ without loss of generality:\n    $X = O(2) \\backslash SL(2, \\mathbb{R}) / GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the quotient space $O(2) \\backslash SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$**\n\n*   This is a quotient by a left group action. Consider the map $\\phi: SL(2, \\mathbb{R}) \\to \\mathcal{P}_1$, where $\\mathcal{P}_1$ is the space of symmetric positive-definite matrices with determinant 1, given by $\\phi(A) = A^T A$.\n*   Let's see when two matrices $A_1, A_2 \\in SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$ have the same image under $\\phi$.\n    $A_1^T A_1 = A_2^T A_2 \\iff (A_2 A_1^{-1})^T (A_2 A_1^{-1}) = I$.\n    This means the matrix $k = A_2 A_1^{-1}$ is orthogonal, i.e., $k \\in O(2)$.\n    So, $A_2 = k A_1$ for some $k \\in O(2)$.\n*   This shows that the fibers of the map $\\phi$ are precisely the left cosets of $O(2)$. The map $\\phi$ is surjective because any matrix in $\\mathcal{P}_1$ has a unique positive-definite square root, which lies in $SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$.\n*   Hence, there is a bijection $O(2) \\backslash SL(2, \\mathbb{R}) \\cong \\mathcal{P}_1$.\n*   The space $\\mathcal{P}_1$ is topologically simple. It can be identified with the upper half-plane model of hyperbolic 2-space, $\\mathbb{H}^2$, which is contractible. A contractible space has trivial homotopy groups.\n\n**Step 4: Relate the homology of X to the fundamental group**\n\n*   Using the result from Step 3, we can write $X$ as a quotient of a contractible space:\n    $X = \\mathcal{P}_1 / GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n*   The action of $GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ on $\\mathcal{P}_1$ is induced from the right action $A \\mapsto AM$ on $SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$. This gives the action on $\\mathcal{P}_1$ as $P \\mapsto M^T P M$ for $P \\in \\mathcal{P}_1$ and $M \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n*   Since $\\mathcal{P}_1$ is contractible, it serves as the universal cover for the orbifold $X$. The fundamental group of the orbifold $X$ is the group of deck transformations, which is precisely $GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n    $\\pi_1(X, \\text{basepoint}) \\cong GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n*   The first homology group with integer coefficients, $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z})$, is the abelianization of the fundamental group:\n    $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\pi_1(X)^{ab} \\cong (GL(2, \\mathbb{Z}))^{ab}$.\n\n**Step 5: Compute the abelianization of $GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$**\n\n*   Let $G = GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$. The abelianization $G^{ab}$ is the quotient group $G/[G,G]$, where $[G,G]$ is the commutator subgroup.\n*   $G$ is generated by matrices like $S = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$, $T = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$, and a matrix with determinant -1, for instance $J = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$. Note that $SL(2, \\mathbb{Z}) = \\langle S, T \\rangle$.\n*   To find the abelianization, we impose the relations that all generators commute. Let $s, t, j$ be the images of $S, T, J$ in the abelian group.\n*   From $SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$, we have the relations $S^4=I$ and $(ST)^3 = S^2$. In the abelianization, this becomes $s^4=1$ and $s^3 t^3 = s^2$, which simplifies to $s t^3 = 1$. From this, we have $s = t^{-3}$. Substituting this into $s^4=1$ gives $(t^{-3})^4 = t^{-12}=1$. So the abelianization of $SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ is generated by $t$ with $t^{12}=1$, i.e., $SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})^{ab} \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_{12}$.\n*   Now consider the relations involving $J$. We have $J^2=I$, $JTJ = T^{-1}$, and $JSJ=S^{-1}$ (or $JSJS=I$). In the abelian group where $j,s,t$ commute, these relations become:\n    1.  $j^2=1$.\n    2.  $jtj = t^{-1} \\implies j^2 t = t^{-1} \\implies t = t^{-1} \\implies t^2=1$.\n    3.  $jsj = s^{-1} \\implies j^2 s = s^{-1} \\implies s = s^{-1} \\implies s^2=1$.\n*   We must satisfy all these relations simultaneously. The relation $t^2=1$ implies $t^{12}=1$, so this is consistent.\n*   The relation $s=t^{-3}$ becomes $s=t^{-1}=t$. So $s=t$. Then $s^2=1$ is the same as $t^2=1$.\n*   Thus, the abelian group is generated by $t$ and $j$, subject to the relations $t^2=1$ and $j^2=1$, with $t$ and $j$ commuting.\n*   This group is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n    $(GL(2, \\mathbb{Z}))^{ab} \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n\n**Final Answer Calculation**\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, we have found that $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong (GL(2, \\mathbb{Z}))^{ab} \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n\nFinal Answer should be presented directly.\n\nFinal Answer is $\\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n\n<<<$\\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2$>>>"
