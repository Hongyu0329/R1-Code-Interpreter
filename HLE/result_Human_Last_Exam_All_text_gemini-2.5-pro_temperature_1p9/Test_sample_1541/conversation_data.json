    "An elegant explanation of how to solve the problem with a focus on memory efficiency.\n\n### Step-by-Step Question Analysis\n\n1.  **The Goal:** The core task is to reorder the numbers in a given sum. The input is a string like `3+2+1`, and the output should be the same numbers sorted non-decreasingly, joined by `+`, like `1+2+3`.\n2.  **Input Details:** The input is a single string. It contains only digits ('1', '2', '3', '4') and the `+` symbol. The string length is at most 1000 characters. It represents a valid mathematical sum.\n3.  **Output Details:** The output must be the sorted version of the sum, in the same format.\n4.  **The Key Constraint:** The solution must be the \"most memory-efficient C program\". This means we must minimize the total amount of memory (RAM) used by our program's variables.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Sorting Algorithm:** Since the numbers to be sorted are only from a very small set {1, 2, 3, 4}, a standard comparison-based sort like quicksort or merge sort is overkill. A **counting sort** is vastly more efficient in both time and memory for this scenario. We can simply count how many 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s appear in the sum.\n2.  **Input Handling:** The most significant portion of memory in a naive solution would be an array to store the input string, which could be up to 1001 bytes (`char s[1001]`). To be maximally memory-efficient, we should question if storing the entire string is necessary. Since we only need the counts of each number, we can process the input stream character-by-character without storing the whole string.\n3.  **Variable Sizing:** In C, different integer types use different amounts of memory (e.g., `char`, `short`, `int`). To minimize memory usage, we should choose the smallest data type that can safely hold the required range of values for each variable.\n    *   A number can appear at most `(1000 + 1) / 2 = 501` times (for an input like `1+1+...+1`). Therefore, our counters must be able to hold a value of at least 501. A `signed char` (typically -128 to 127) is too small, but a `short int` (typically -32768 to 32767) is sufficient.\n    *   `getchar()` function in C returns an `int`, not a `char`, so it can handle the special `EOF` (End-of-File) value. The variable reading its result must be an `int`.\n\n### Step-by-Step Path to the Final Answer\n\nBased on the points above, we can devise a highly memory-efficient algorithm and calculate the memory usage.\n\n1.  **Algorithm Design:**\n    *   **Phase 1: Counting.** Do not declare a large character array for the input. Instead, read the input one character at a time using `getchar()`. In a loop, check if the character is a digit ('1' through '4'). If it is, increment the corresponding counter in a `counts` array of size 4.\n    *   **Phase 2: Printing.** After counting is complete (the input stream ends), print the sorted sum. Iterate from 1 to 4. For each number, print it the number of times indicated by its counter. Print `+` symbols between the numbers. A simple flag variable can be used to ensure `+` is only printed *between* numbers, not at the beginning or end. Use `putchar()` for printing, as it's a lightweight function.\n\n2.  **Memory Calculation (m):** We now sum the memory used by all variables in this optimized C program. We assume a standard environment where `sizeof(char)` is 1, `sizeof(short)` is 2, and `sizeof(int)` is 4.\n\n    *   **Counters (`counts` array):** We need 4 counters. As determined, each must be a `short`.\n        *   `short counts[4];` -> `4 * sizeof(short)` = `4 * 2` = **8 bytes**.\n    *   **Input character holder:** The variable to hold the result of `getchar()`. It must be an `int`.\n        *   `int c;` -> `sizeof(int)` = **4 bytes**.\n    *   **Auxiliary variables:** We need loop counters and a flag for printing.\n        *   Outer loop counter (for numbers 1 to 4): Its range is 0-3. A `char` is sufficient. -> `sizeof(char)` = **1 byte**.\n        *   Inner loop counter (for printing `count` times): Its range can go up to 501. A `short` is required. -> `sizeof(short)` = **2 bytes**.\n        *   Flag for `+` printing: Can be 0 or 1. A `char` is sufficient. -> `sizeof(char)` = **1 byte**.\n\n3.  **Total Memory (`m`):**\n    `m` = (memory for `counts`) + (memory for `c`) + (memory for outer loop counter) + (memory for inner loop counter) + (memory for flag)\n    `m` = 8 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 1 = **16 bytes**.\n\nThis approach avoids the ~1KB buffer for the input string and uses the smallest appropriate data types, making it extremely memory-efficient and directly answering the problem's primary constraint.\n\n<<<16>>>"
