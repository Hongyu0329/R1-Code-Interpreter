    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the current Vietnamese province where Ming General Mu Sheng experienced his first major defeat.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Historical Context:** The question refers to the period of the Ming Dynasty's occupation of Vietnam in the early 15th century and the subsequent Lam Sơn Uprising (1418–1427) led by Lê Lợi to regain independence. Ming General Mu Sheng (Vietnamese: Mộc Thạnh) was a key figure in the Ming campaigns during this era.\n\n2.  **Pinpoint Mu Sheng's Major Defeat:** While the Ming army suffered several setbacks during the long rebellion, we need to find a *major* defeat where Mu Sheng was the principal commander of the defeated army.\n    *   The initial Ming invasion (1406-1407) was largely successful.\n    *   The most significant Ming defeats occurred towards the end of the Lam Sơn Uprising. The two most prominent are the Battle of Tốt Động – Chúc Động (1426) and the Chi Lăng – Xương Giang Campaign (1427).\n    *   At the Battle of Tốt Động – Chúc Động, the Ming commander who was decisively defeated was Wang Tong (Vương Thông). Although Mu Sheng held a high rank in the occupation administration, this was not his personal defeat as a field commander.\n    *   This leaves the campaign of 1427. The Ming Emperor sent two large reinforcement armies to quell the rebellion once and for all. One army advanced from Guangxi under the command of Liu Sheng (Liễu Thăng). The second army advanced from Yunnan under the command of **Mu Sheng**. This is the key event.\n\n3.  **Analyze the 1427 Campaign:**\n    *   Liu Sheng's army was ambushed and completely destroyed first in a series of battles, culminating at Chi Lăng Pass (in modern Lạng Sơn province).\n    *   Mu Sheng's army was advancing from the west, along the Thao River (the upper section of the Red River). When news of Liu Sheng's total annihilation reached Mu Sheng's camp, his army's morale plummeted.\n    *   The Vietnamese forces, commanded by generals Phạm Văn Xảo and Trịnh Khả, then moved to intercept Mu Sheng's army. They engaged Mu Sheng's forces near the river crossings at **Lãnh Câu** and **Đan Xá**.\n    *   Faced with determined Vietnamese resistance and terrified by the fate of the other Ming army, Mu Sheng's forces broke and began a chaotic retreat back to Yunnan. They were pursued and suffered heavy losses. This rout of his entire army was unequivocally a major defeat for Mu Sheng as a commander. As it was the primary campaign he personally led that ended in disaster, it qualifies as his first major defeat.\n\n4.  **Identify the Modern Location:**\n    *   The key battle sites where Mu Sheng's army was engaged and broken before its retreat were Lãnh Câu and Đan Xá.\n    *   Historical sources place these locations along the Thao River (Sông Thao).\n    *   Mapping these historical events to modern geography places the battlefields within the territory of what is now **Phú Thọ Province**.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **\"First\" Major Defeat:** It is crucial to distinguish this event from earlier skirmishes or battles where Mu Sheng was not the primary field commander. The 1427 campaign was the first time an army under his direct command was comprehensively defeated in a major engagement during this war.\n*   **Distinguishing between Commanders:** It is important not to confuse Mu Sheng's defeat with Liu Sheng's more famous defeat at Chi Lăng Pass, which occurred in Lạng Sơn Province just before Mu Sheng's own army was routed.\n*   **Historical vs. Modern Geography:** The analysis requires connecting the 15th-century battle locations (Lãnh Câu, Đan Xá on the Thao River) to the current provincial map of Vietnam.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe major defeat of Ming General Mu Sheng occurred in 1427 when his relief army from Yunnan was routed by Lam Sơn forces. The key engagements that broke his army's morale and forced its retreat took place at Lãnh Câu and Đan Xá, which are located in modern-day Phú Thọ Province.\n\n<<<Phú Thọ Province>>>"
