    "This is a fascinating and very specific movie puzzle. Let's break it down to find the correct film.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Clues:**\n    *   **Film Property:** It must be an Oscar-nominated film.\n    *   **Character Action:** A character says the words \"Thank you.\"\n    *   **Location/Context:** This happens while or just before boarding a bus (or a similar mode of public transport).\n    *   **Consequence:** This specific act seals the character's fate, meaning it leads to a negative outcome like getting caught, having their cover blown, or being forced into a dangerous situation.\n\n2.  **Initial Brainstorming and Common Misconceptions:**\n    *   A very common answer that comes to mind for a \"small mistake blows a character's cover\" scene is from ***Inglourious Basterds*** (2009). In a tavern, a British spy posing as a German officer (Lt. Archie Hicox) orders three drinks using the wrong hand gesture. This seals his fate. However, this doesn't match the specific clues: he doesn't say \"Thank you\" as the giveaway, and it's in a tavern, not on a bus.\n    *   Another possibility is ***The Great Escape*** (1963). An Allied POW, MacDonald, says \"Good luck\" in English at a checkpoint, which exposes him. This is closer, but the phrase is wrong, it's at a checkpoint, and the film was only nominated for one Oscar (Best Film Editing).\n    *   These examples show that the \"small mistake reveals a hidden identity\" is a common trope, but the specific details of \"Thank you\" and \"bus\" are crucial.\n\n3.  **Identifying the Correct Film:**\n    *   The clues point directly to a classic Alfred Hitchcock thriller: ***North by Northwest*** (1959). This film was nominated for three Academy Awards, including Best Original Screenplay.\n    *   **The Scene:** The protagonist, Roger Thornhill (played by Cary Grant), is on the run from both the police and a criminal syndicate. To escape, he disguises himself as a Red Cap porter at a train station in Chicago.\n    *   **The Fatal Mistake:** He helps the spy Eve Kendall with her bags. To help him maintain his cover, she diverts the attention of a real porter. Thinking he is in the clear, Thornhill accepts the tip she gives him and instinctively says, **\"Thank you.\"** A suspicious porter overhears this out-of-place remark, which immediately blows Thornhill's cover.\n    *   **The Consequence:** The police are alerted, and Thornhill is forced to abandon his hiding spot and flee by jumping aboard the 20th Century Limited train. This action seals his fate, as it leads him directly into a trap set by Eve Kendall and the very villains he was trying to escape.\n\n### Careful Points:\n\n*   **Bus vs. Train:** The user's query mentions a \"bus,\" while the scene in *North by Northwest* takes place at a train station and involves boarding a train. This is a minor and very common type of memory substitution, as both are large, public transport vehicles central to the escape.\n*   **Sealing his Fate:** Saying \"Thank you\" is the direct trigger for his disguise being compromised. This forces him onto the train, which is a pivotal moment that propels the rest of the plot and puts him in immense danger.\n*   **Oscar Nomination:** *North by Northwest* fits the criterion of being an Oscar-nominated film.\n\nBased on this step-by-step analysis, the specific and unique combination of clues points definitively to one film.\n\n<<<North by Northwest>>>"
