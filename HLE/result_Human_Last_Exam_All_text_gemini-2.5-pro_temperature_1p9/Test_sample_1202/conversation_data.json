    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question and the provided options:\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**1. Understand the core concept: Gene Duplication and its Fates**\n\n*   **Gene Duplication:** This is an event where a region of a chromosome containing a gene is copied, resulting in two identical copies of that gene in the genome. These copies are known as paralogs.\n*   **Initial State:** Immediately after duplication, both gene copies are identical. Since one copy is usually sufficient to perform the original function, the second copy is redundant. This redundancy means there is relaxed selective pressure on the duplicate copy, allowing it to accumulate mutations.\n*   **The Question's Focus:** The question asks for the mechanism that explains two key outcomes:\n    1.  **Retention:** The duplicate gene is kept in the genome over evolutionary time, not lost.\n    2.  **Divergence:** The sequence of the duplicate gene changes and becomes different from the original gene.\n\n**2. Evaluate Each Answer Choice**\n\n*   **A. Gene conversion:** This is a molecular process where one of the duplicate genes copies its sequence over the other, effectively making them identical or very similar again. This mechanism works *against* divergence and promotes homogenization. Therefore, it does not explain the retention of *diverged* genes.\n\n*   **B. Pseudogenization:** This is the most common fate of a duplicate gene. The redundant copy accumulates inactivating mutations (like stop codons or frameshifts) and becomes a non-functional \"pseudogene\". While this involves divergence (the sequence changes), it leads to the *loss* of function and ultimately the loss of the gene from the functional parts of the genome, not its *retention* as a working gene.\n\n*   **C. Neofunctionalization:** In this model, the original gene continues to perform its ancestral function. The duplicate copy, free from strong purifying selection, acquires mutations that give it a completely new, beneficial function.\n    *   **Retention:** Both genes are kept because one performs the old essential function, and the new one performs a new beneficial function.\n    *   **Divergence:** The sequences diverge as one copy evolves its new function.\n    *   **Careful Point:** This mechanism requires a rare event—a beneficial, gain-of-function mutation—to occur before the gene becomes a pseudogene.\n\n*   **D. Subfunctionalization:** This model applies when the ancestral gene had multiple, distinct functions (i.e., it was pleiotropic). After duplication, each of the two copies accumulates different degenerative mutations, knocking out different sub-functions. For example, copy 1 loses sub-function B but retains A, while copy 2 loses sub-function A but retains B.\n    *   **Retention:** Both genes are now essential and must be retained because together they perform the full set of functions of the original ancestral gene.\n    *   **Divergence:** The genes diverge as they accumulate different inactivating mutations in different parts of their regulatory or coding regions.\n    *   **Careful Point:** This mechanism relies on common loss-of-function mutations, which are statistically more probable than the rare gain-of-function mutations required for neofunctionalization. This makes it a more likely \"default\" pathway for preserving duplicate genes immediately after duplication.\n\n*   **E. Adaptive radiation:** This is a large-scale evolutionary pattern where a single lineage rapidly diversifies into many new species. While gene duplication can provide the genetic raw material that facilitates adaptive radiation, it is a macroevolutionary outcome, not a *molecular mechanism* for retaining and diverging a single gene pair. It describes the fate of species, not genes.\n\n**3. Compare the most plausible options (Neofunctionalization vs. Subfunctionalization)**\n\n*   Both neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization explain both the retention and divergence of duplicate genes.\n*   The question asks which is **\"most likely\"**.\n*   The subfunctionalization model (also called the Duplication-Degeneration-Complementation model) provides a passive route to preservation. It doesn't require a rare, special, beneficial mutation. Instead, it relies on the much more common occurrence of random, degenerative mutations. As long as these mutations affect different sub-functions in the two copies, both copies become necessary and are preserved.\n*   Because it relies on more frequent mutational events, subfunctionalization is considered by many evolutionary biologists to be a more common and thus more *likely* mechanism for the initial retention of duplicate genes. It acts as a \"safe harbor,\" preventing the duplicate from being lost and giving it more evolutionary time to potentially evolve a new function later on (neofunctionalization).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nSubfunctionalization provides a more probable and widespread pathway for the initial preservation and divergence of duplicate genes because it is driven by common degenerative mutations, whereas neofunctionalization depends on rare beneficial mutations.\n\n<<<D>>>"
