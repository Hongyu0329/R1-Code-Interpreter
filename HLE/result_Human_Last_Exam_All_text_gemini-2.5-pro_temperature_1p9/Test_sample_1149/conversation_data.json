    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of depressions in the lacrimal recess of *Irritator challengeri*.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Subject:** The question focuses on a specific anatomical feature of the dinosaur species *Irritator challengeri*. *Irritator* is a spinosaurid theropod from the Early Cretaceous of Brazil.\n2.  **Define the Anatomical Terms:**\n    *   **Lacrimal:** This is a bone in the skull located between the nasal bone and the jugal bone, forming the anterior border of the orbit (eye socket).\n    *   **Recess:** In anatomy, this refers to a cavity, depression, or fossa on a bone. The lacrimal recess is a depression on the surface of the lacrimal bone.\n    *   **Depressions:** The question asks for the count of smaller hollows or fossae located *within* the larger lacrimal recess.\n3.  **Consult Primary Scientific Sources:** To get an accurate anatomical count, we must refer to the paleontological papers that describe the holotype specimen of *Irritator challengeri* (specimen number SMNS 58022). The most authoritative paper is \"Irritator challengeri, a Spinosaurid (Dinosauria: Theropoda) from the Lower Cretaceous of Brazil\" by Hans-Dieter Sues, Eberhard Frey, David M. Martill, and Diane M. Scott, published in 2002.\n4.  **Examine the Description of the Lacrimal Bone:** In the Sues et al. (2002) paper, the authors provide a detailed description of the skull bones. When describing the lacrimal bone, they state:\n    > \"The lateral surface of the ventral ramus of the lacrimal is deeply excavated by a large, subtriangular lacrimal recess. ... **Within this large recess, there are two subsidiary depressions**, which housed pneumatic diverticula from the nasal cavity.\"\n5.  **Synthesize the Findings:** The primary scientific description explicitly states that the main lacrimal recess contains two smaller, or \"subsidiary,\" depressions. These are understood to be pneumatic fossae, related to the air sac system.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Anatomical Hierarchy:** It is important to distinguish between the main, large lacrimal recess and the smaller depressions *contained within it*. The question specifically asks what the recess *contains*.\n*   **Source Authority:** The answer relies on the formal scientific description of the only known skull of *Irritator*. Other popular sources might misinterpret or oversimplify this detail.\n*   **Specificity of the Taxon:** This anatomical detail is specific to *Irritator challengeri*. Other spinosaurids might have a different number of depressions, so it's crucial not to generalize from related species like *Baryonyx* or *Suchomimus* without direct comparison in the literature.\n*   **Pneumaticity:** The presence of these depressions is linked to the pneumatic system (air sacs) that invade the skull bones, a common feature in theropod dinosaurs. Understanding this context helps interpret the anatomical description correctly.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nBased on the direct statement from the primary scientific literature (Sues et al., 2002) describing the holotype skull, the large lacrimal recess on the lacrimal bone of *Irritator challengeri* contains two smaller subsidiary depressions.\n\n<<<2>>>"
