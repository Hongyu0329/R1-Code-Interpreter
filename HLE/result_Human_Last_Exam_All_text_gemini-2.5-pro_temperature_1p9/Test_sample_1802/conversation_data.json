    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the maximal rank of the complementary channel of a Pauli channel.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Define a Qudit Pauli Channel**\n\nA qudit is a quantum system in a d-dimensional Hilbert space, denoted as $\\mathcal{H} \\cong \\mathbb{C}^d$. The generalized Pauli operators (or Weyl-Heisenberg operators) form a basis for operators on this space. They are defined as:\n$U_{ab} = X^a Z^b$ for $a, b \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, d-1\\}$, where:\n*   $X |k\\rangle = |(k+1) \\pmod d \\rangle$ is the shift operator.\n*   $Z |k\\rangle = \\omega^k |k\\rangle$ is the clock operator, with $\\omega = e^{2\\pi i/d}$.\n\nThese $d^2$ operators are unitary ($U_{ab}^\\dagger U_{ab} = I$) and form an orthogonal basis for the space of $d \\times d$ matrices under the Hilbert-Schmidt inner product, i.e., $\\text{Tr}(U_{ab}^\\dagger U_{cd}) = d \\cdot \\delta_{ac}\\delta_{bd}$.\n\nA Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ is a quantum channel that can be expressed in the form:\n$\\Lambda(\\rho) = \\sum_{a,b=0}^{d-1} p_{ab} U_{ab} \\rho U_{ab}^\\dagger$\nwhere $\\rho$ is a density matrix.\n\nFor $\\Lambda$ to be a valid quantum channel, it must be completely positive and trace-preserving (CPTP).\n*   **Trace-Preserving (TP):** The sum of the Kraus operators squared must be the identity. The Kraus operators for this channel can be written as $K_{ab} = \\sqrt{p_{ab}} U_{ab}$. The TP condition is $\\sum_{a,b} K_{ab}^\\dagger K_{ab} = I$.\n    $\\sum_{a,b} (\\sqrt{p_{ab}} U_{ab})^\\dagger (\\sqrt{p_{ab}} U_{ab}) = \\sum_{a,b} p_{ab} U_{ab}^\\dagger U_{ab} = \\sum_{a,b} p_{ab} I = (\\sum_{a,b} p_{ab}) I$.\n    For this to equal $I$, we must have $\\sum_{a,b} p_{ab} = 1$.\n*   **Completely Positive (CP):** A map is CP if it has a Kraus representation. Here, we can write $\\Lambda$ in the Kraus form as long as the coefficients $p_{ab}$ are real and non-negative, i.e., $p_{ab} \\ge 0$.\n\nTherefore, a Pauli channel is defined by a probability distribution $\\{p_{ab}\\}$ over the $d^2$ Pauli operators.\n\n**Step 2: Define the Complementary Channel and its Rank**\n\nAny quantum channel $\\Lambda$ can be described using a Stinespring dilation. This means there exists an isometry $V: \\mathcal{H}_S \\to \\mathcal{H}_S \\otimes \\mathcal{H}_E$ (where S is the system and E is the environment) such that $\\Lambda(\\rho) = \\text{Tr}_E[V \\rho V^\\dagger]$. The Kraus operators of $\\Lambda$ are given by $K_i = \\langle e_i | V$, where $\\{|e_i\\rangle\\}$ is an orthonormal basis for $\\mathcal{H}_E$.\n\nThe complementary channel $\\Lambda^c$ is defined by tracing over the system instead of the environment:\n$\\Lambda^c(\\rho) = \\text{Tr}_S[V \\rho V^\\dagger]$\n\nThe rank of a quantum channel is defined as the rank of its Choi matrix. The Choi matrix of a channel $\\Phi: \\mathcal{L}(\\mathcal{H}_A) \\to \\mathcal{L}(\\mathcal{H}_B)$ is given by $J(\\Phi) = (I_A \\otimes \\Phi)(|\\Phi^+\\rangle\\langle\\Phi^+|)$, where $|\\Phi^+\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{d}} \\sum_{i=0}^{d-1} |i\\rangle_A \\otimes |i\\rangle_A$ is the maximally entangled state.\n\n**Step 3: Relate the Rank of the Channel and its Complement**\n\nA fundamental result in quantum information theory states that the ranks of the Choi matrices of a channel and its complementary channel are equal.\nThis is because if $| \\Psi_V \\rangle = (V \\otimes I) |\\Phi^+\\rangle$ is a pure state tripartite system, then $J(\\Lambda) = \\text{Tr}_E[|\\Psi_V\\rangle\\langle\\Psi_V|]$ and $J(\\Lambda^c) = \\text{Tr}_S[|\\Psi_V\\rangle\\langle\\Psi_V|]$. The ranks of the partial traces of a pure state are equal (this is related to the Schmidt decomposition).\nTherefore, we have the crucial identity:\n$\\text{rank}(\\Lambda) = \\text{rank}(\\Lambda^c)$\n\nThis simplifies our problem immensely. We now need to find the maximal rank of a Pauli channel $\\Lambda$.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Rank of a Pauli Channel**\n\nThe rank of a channel $\\Lambda$ is equal to the minimum number of Kraus operators needed in any Kraus representation $\\Lambda(\\rho) = \\sum_i A_i \\rho A_i^\\dagger$. This is known as the Choi rank.\n\nFor a Pauli channel, we have the representation $\\Lambda(\\rho) = \\sum_{a,b} (\\sqrt{p_{ab}} U_{ab}) \\rho (\\sqrt{p_{ab}} U_{ab})^\\dagger$. The operators $\\{U_{ab}\\}$ are linearly independent. This means that if we want to represent $\\Lambda$, we cannot combine them into a smaller set of operators. Consequently, the minimum number of Kraus operators needed is exactly the number of non-zero probabilities $p_{ab}$.\n\nSo, the rank of a Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ is given by:\n$\\text{rank}(\\Lambda) = |\\{ (a,b) | p_{ab} > 0 \\}|$\n\n**Step 5: Maximize the Rank**\n\nTo find the maximal rank, we need to find the maximum possible number of non-zero probabilities $p_{ab}$ that form a valid CPTP Pauli channel.\nThe conditions are:\n1.  $p_{ab} \\ge 0$ for all $a, b$.\n2.  $\\sum_{a,b=0}^{d-1} p_{ab} = 1$.\n\nThere are a total of $d \\times d = d^2$ distinct Pauli operators $U_{ab}$. To maximize the number of non-zero $p_{ab}$, we can choose a probability distribution with full support, meaning $p_{ab} > 0$ for all $d^2$ possible index pairs $(a,b)$.\n\nA simple example is the uniform distribution:\n$p_{ab} = \\frac{1}{d^2}$ for all $a,b \\in \\{0, \\dots, d-1\\}$.\n\nThis distribution satisfies the conditions:\n1.  $p_{ab} = 1/d^2 > 0$ for all $(a,b)$.\n2.  $\\sum_{a,b} p_{ab} = \\sum_{a,b} \\frac{1}{d^2} = d^2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{d^2} = 1$.\n\nFor this choice of probabilities, the channel is the completely depolarizing channel, $\\Lambda(\\rho) = \\frac{I}{d}$. The number of non-zero probabilities is $d^2$. Therefore, the rank of this channel is $d^2$.\n\nSince there are only $d^2$ Pauli operators in total, the rank cannot exceed $d^2$. Thus, the maximal possible rank is $d^2$.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe rank of the complementary channel $\\Lambda^c$ is equal to the rank of the original channel $\\Lambda$. The rank of a Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ is the number of non-zero probabilities $p_{ab}$ in its definition. To maximize this number, we can choose a probability distribution where all $d^2$ probabilities are non-zero (e.g., the uniform distribution). This leads to a maximal rank of $d^2$."
