The nonabelian filled groups of order 2q^m, for an odd prime q and a natural number m, are the generalized dihedral groups D(A), where A is any abelian group of order q^m. A group in this family is constructed as the semidirect product A ⋊ C₂, where the action of the non-identity element of C₂ on A is the inversion map, i.e., it sends every element a ∈ A to its inverse a⁻¹.
