    "An analysis of the question is performed step-by-step as follows.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruction of the problem and definitions\n\nThe question asks for the classification of all nonabelian filled groups of a specific order, 2q^m, where q is an odd prime and m is a natural number. Let's define the key terms.\n\n*   **Group Order**: The order of the group G is |G| = 2q^m. Here q is an odd prime (q ≥ 3) and m ≥ 1.\n*   **Nonabelian Group**: A group G where the commutative law does not hold, i.e., there exist a, b ∈ G such that ab ≠ ba.\n*   **Product-Free Set**: A subset S ⊆ G is product-free if for all a, b, c ∈ S (not necessarily distinct), ab ≠ c. This is equivalent to the condition S ∩ (S.S) = ∅, where S.S = {s₁s₂ | s₁, s₂ ∈ S}.\n*   **Maximal by Inclusion Product-Free Set**: A product-free set M is maximal if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set. That is, for any element g ∈ G \\ M, the set M ∪ {g} is not product-free.\n*   **Filled Group**: A finite group G is filled if every maximal by inclusion product-free set M in G satisfies the property G = M ∪ M.S ∪ {e}, where e is the identity element of G. This property is described as \"M fills G\".\n\n### Step 2: Structural Analysis of Groups of Order 2q^m\n\nLet G be a group of order |G| = 2q^m.\n1.  **Sylow Subgroups**: According to Sylow's Theorems, the number of Sylow q-subgroups, denoted n_q, must divide the order of the group divided by the order of the Sylow q-subgroup, which is |G|/q^m = 2. So n_q can be 1 or 2.\n2.  Also, n_q must be congruent to 1 modulo q. So n_q ≡ 1 (mod q). Since q is an odd prime, q ≥ 3.\n3.  Combining these conditions, if n_q = 2, then 2 ≡ 1 (mod q), which implies q divides 2-1=1. This is impossible. Therefore, n_q must be 1.\n4.  Since there is only one Sylow q-subgroup, it must be a normal subgroup of G. Let's call this normal subgroup Q, with |Q| = q^m.\n5.  Let P be a Sylow 2-subgroup. Its order is |P| = 2, so P is isomorphic to the cyclic group C₂.\n6.  Since Q is a normal subgroup of G and Q ∩ P = {e} (by Lagrange's theorem), G is a semidirect product of Q and P. We write this as G = Q ⋊ P ≅ Q ⋊ C₂.\n7.  The group G is nonabelian if and only if the semidirect product is not a direct product, which means the action of C₂ on Q by conjugation is non-trivial. Let the generator of C₂ be x. The action is determined by an automorphism α: Q → Q defined by α(a) = xax⁻¹ for a ∈ Q. For the product to be non-direct, α must not be the identity automorphism. Since x² = e, the automorphism α must satisfy α² = id (the identity automorphism).\n\nSo, the nonabelian groups of order 2q^m are semidirect products G = Q ⋊ C₂ where Q is a group of order q^m and the action is given by a non-trivial automorphism α ∈ Aut(Q) with α² = id.\n\n### Step 3: Application of Known Theorems on Filled Groups\n\nClassifying filled groups from first principles is complex. We rely on established results in the field. A key result concerning groups of this specific order comes from the work of P. H. Diananda and H. P. Yap, which was later generalized. The most direct result is the following theorem:\n\n**Theorem**: A nonabelian group G of order 2p^m, where p is an odd prime and m is a natural number, is a filled group if and only if G is isomorphic to a generalized dihedral group D(A), where A is an *abelian* group of order p^m.\n\nApplying this theorem to our case (with p = q), a nonabelian group G of order 2q^m is filled if and only if it is a generalized dihedral group D(A) built upon an *abelian* group A of order q^m.\n\n### Step 4: Describing the Solution Groups\n\n1.  **The Base Group A**: The theorem specifies that the normal Sylow q-subgroup, which we called Q, must be abelian. Let's rename it A to match the theorem's notation. So, A is an abelian group of order q^m. By the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups, A is isomorphic to a direct product of cyclic groups:\n    A ≅ C_{q^{m_1}} × C_{q^{m_2}} × ... × C_{q^{m_k}}\n    where m₁ + m₂ + ... + m_k = m. For each distinct partition of m, there is a non-isomorphic abelian group A.\n\n2.  **The Group Structure D(A)**: The generalized dihedral group D(A) is defined as the semidirect product D(A) = A ⋊ C₂, where the non-trivial element of C₂ acts on A by the **inversion automorphism**.\n    Let A be the abelian group, and let C₂ = <x | x² = e>. The group D(A) is defined by the presentation:\n    D(A) = < A, x | x² = e, xax⁻¹ = a⁻¹ for all a ∈ A >.\n\n3.  **Verification**:\n    *   **Order**: The order of D(A) is |A| × |C₂| = q^m × 2.\n    *   **Nonabelian**: The action xax⁻¹ = a⁻¹ is non-trivial as long as A contains elements that are not their own inverses. Since A is a group of odd order q^m > 1, any non-identity element a ∈ A has odd order and thus a ≠ a⁻¹. Therefore, D(A) is nonabelian.\n    *   **The automorphism**: The map α(a) = a⁻¹ is indeed an automorphism of A because A is abelian:\n      α(ab) = (ab)⁻¹ = b⁻¹a⁻¹ = a⁻¹b⁻¹ (since A is abelian) = α(a)α(b).\n      Since α²(a) = (a⁻¹)⁻¹ = a, α has order 2.\n\nThis analysis shows that the specified family of groups—the generalized dihedral groups over abelian groups of order q^m—are the only nonabelian filled groups of order 2q^m. All other candidates, such as those where the Sylow q-subgroup is nonabelian or where the action is not inversion, are excluded by the \"if and only if\" nature of the theorem.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe nonabelian filled groups of order 2q^m, for an odd prime q and a natural number m, are the **generalized dihedral groups** D(A), where A is an abelian group of order q^m.\n\nThese groups are defined as the semidirect product A ⋊ C₂, where the non-identity element of C₂ acts on A as the inversion automorphism. That is, if C₂ = <x | x² = e>, the group structure is given by the relations:\n**G = < A, x | x² = e, xax⁻¹ = a⁻¹ for all a ∈ A >**.\n\nThe possible structures for the abelian group A are determined by the partitions of m. For each partition m = m₁ + ... + m_k, A can be A ≅ C_{q^{m_1}} × ... × C_{q^{m_k}}, leading to a distinct nonabelian filled group of order 2q^m.\n\n<<<The nonabelian filled groups of order 2q^m, for an odd prime q and a natural number m, are the generalized dihedral groups D(A), where A is any abelian group of order q^m. A group in this family is constructed as the semidirect product A ⋊ C₂, where the action of the non-identity element of C₂ on A is the inversion map, i.e., it sends every element a ∈ A to its inverse a⁻¹.>>>"
