    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core components of the question.**\nThe question asks to identify a specific \"unique architectural feature\" that was present in the \"Piazza della Rotonda\" (the square in front of the Pantheon in Rome) but was removed in the year 1950.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the key elements.**\n*   **Location:** Piazza della Rotonda, Rome.\n*   **Permanent Landmark:** The Pantheon church.\n*   **Object in Question:** A \"unique architectural feature\". This implies something man-made that contributed to the square's appearance and structure.\n*   **Action:** It was \"removed\".\n*   **Timeframe:** The removal happened \"until 1950,\" which implies it was dismantled around that year.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the permanent features of the Piazza.**\nThe main, enduring features of the piazza are the Pantheon itself and the Fontana del Pantheon (the fountain with the obelisk at its center). These were clearly not removed in 1950. Therefore, the feature in question must be something else that was added and later taken away.\n\n**Step 4: Investigate the history of the piazza's urban development.**\nIn the late 19th and first half of the 20th century, many European cities, including Rome, developed extensive public transport systems, most notably tramways. These networks often ran directly through historic city centers and famous squares. We must investigate if such a system existed in Piazza della Rotonda.\n\n**Step 5: Find historical evidence.**\nHistorical photographs and city plans of Rome from the period before 1950 show that a tram line did indeed run through the Piazza della Rotonda.\n\n**Step 6: Identify what made the feature \"unique\".**\nThe tramway in this specific piazza was not just a straight track passing through. It was constructed as a prominent loop, an \"anello tranviario\" in Italian, that encircled the central fountain. The tracks, along with the necessary overhead electrical lines, created a very distinctive, and by modern standards, intrusive feature within the historic square. This \"tram ring\" is a strong candidate for the \"unique architectural feature\".\n\n**Step 7: Confirm the removal date.**\nFollowing World War II, the Rome city administration began a program to modernize traffic flow and to \"restore\" the monumental appearance of its historical center. This involved dismantling many tram lines in the central districts and replacing them with buses. The tram ring around the Pantheon was part of this network that was removed during this post-war period. The year 1950 falls precisely within this timeframe of tramway removal from Rome's historic heart.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the analysis, the unique architectural feature removed from Piazza della Rotonda around 1950 was the tramway ring that encircled the central fountain.\n\n<<<A tramway ring (anello tranviario) that looped around the central fountain.>>>"
