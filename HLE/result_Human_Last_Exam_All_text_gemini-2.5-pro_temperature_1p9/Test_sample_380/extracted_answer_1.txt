The local magnetic field at the L1 point is generally not considered radial. It follows the Parker Spiral and is typically angled at about 45 degrees to the radial direction. The calculation of normalized magnetic helicity using components perpendicular to the radial direction (Y and Z in a GSE-like system) is therefore an approximation. This approximation is justified because, for large statistical studies, it is computationally convenient and, most importantly, it correctly identifies the polarization sense (i.e., the sign of the helicity, indicating left or right-handedness). The sign remains robust because the sense of rotation of the wave's magnetic field vector is preserved when projected onto the Y-Z plane, even though the true propagation direction is not purely radial. The magnitude of the calculated helicity will, however, be underestimated. The most rigorous method involves transforming the data into a local Field-Aligned Coordinate system where the calculation is performed in a plane truly perpendicular to the local magnetic field.
