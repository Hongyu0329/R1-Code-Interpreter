    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the oligomeric state of the protein coiled-coil sequence.\n\n**1. Identify the Heptad Repeat Structure**\n\nCoiled-coils are formed by α-helices that wrap around each other. Their sequences are characterized by a repeating pattern of seven amino acids, known as a heptad repeat, denoted as `(abcdefg)n`. The positions in this repeat have specific roles:\n*   **`a` and `d` positions:** These are typically hydrophobic residues (like Leucine (L), Isoleucine (I), Valine (V), Alanine (A)). They face inward and form the hydrophobic core that holds the helices together. The nature of these residues is the primary determinant of the oligomeric state.\n*   **`e` and `g` positions:** These are often charged or polar residues (like Lysine (K), Arginine (R), Glutamic acid (E)). They are located on the periphery of the hydrophobic core and can form stabilizing salt bridges between helices.\n*   **`b`, `c`, and `f` positions:** These are typically solvent-exposed and are usually occupied by polar or charged amino acids.\n\n**2. Assign Heptad Positions to the Sequence**\n\nThe given sequence is: `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG`\n\nWe need to find the correct `abcdefg` register. The key is to find a repeating pattern where hydrophobic residues consistently fall into the `a` and `d` positions. These positions are separated by two amino acids (`a-x-x-d`) and three amino acids (`d-x-x-x-a`).\n\nLet's test an alignment by assigning the first major hydrophobic residue, Isoleucine (I) at position 3, to a core `d` position.\n*   If `I` at pos 3 is `d`, then `L` at pos 7 would be `a`. (`d-e-f-g-a`)\n*   Let's check if this pattern propagates:\n    *   Sequence: `G E **I** A Q S **L** K E **I** A K S **L** K E **I** A W S **L** K E **I** A Q S **L** K G`\n    *   Core positions `a`: `L` (pos 7), `L` (pos 14), `L` (pos 21), `L` (pos 28). This is perfectly consistent.\n    *   Core positions `d`: `I` (pos 3), `I` (pos 10), `I` (pos 17), `I` (pos 24). This is also perfectly consistent.\n\nThis gives us the following confirmed assignment for the core residues:\n*   **`a` positions:** All are **Leucine (L)**.\n*   **`d` positions:** All are **Isoleucine (I)**.\n\n**3. Analyze Packing Efficiency (Knobs-into-Holes)**\n\nThe \"knobs-into-holes\" model describes how side chains from one helix (the \"knobs\") pack into cavities formed by side chains on the adjacent helix/helices (the \"holes\"). The size and shape of the `a` and `d` residues dictate the optimal packing arrangement, and thus the number of helices in the coil.\n\nBased on seminal studies by Harbury and others, the identity of residues at the `a` and `d` positions strongly predicts the oligomeric state:\n*   **Dimer (2 helices):** In a dimer, the `a` position of one helix packs against the `a` position of the other helix, and `d` packs against `d`. This arrangement is very sensitive to steric clashes. The β-branched side chain of Isoleucine (branched at the second carbon of the side chain) creates significant steric hindrance when placed at the `d` position, as two `I` residues would clash head-on. The combination `a=L, d=I` strongly disfavors a dimeric structure.\n*   **Trimer (3 helices):** In a trimer, the packing is different. Each \"knob\" from one helix packs into a \"hole\" formed by residues on the other two helices. This arrangement is more accommodating to bulky side chains. The `a=L, d=I` pattern fits very well into a trimeric coiled-coil structure. The bulky Isoleucine at the `d` position can be comfortably accommodated in the hydrophobic core of a trimer without the steric clashes found in a dimer.\n*   **Tetramer (4 helices):** In a tetramer, the four `d` positions form a very tight, buried central core. This requires a very small residue at the `d` position, almost exclusively Alanine (A). A bulky residue like Isoleucine at the `d` position would cause severe steric clashes and is highly unfavorable for a tetramer.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\n*   The sequence has a consistent `a=L` and `d=I` pattern in its heptad repeats.\n*   This specific pattern (`a=L, d=I`) is known to cause steric hindrance in dimeric and tetrameric arrangements due to the bulky, β-branched Isoleucine at the `d` position.\n*   The trimeric coiled-coil provides the most efficient and sterically favorable packing for this combination of core residues.\n\nTherefore, the protein is most likely to form a trimer.\n\n<<<B>>>"
