    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the lowest of the last three notes for the first violin in Dvořák's Symphony No. 2, Op. 4.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Musical Piece and Section**\nThe question asks about Antonín Dvořák's \"Symphony No. 2, Op. 4\". Specifically, it focuses on the final three notes played by the first violin section at the very end of the piece. A symphony typically ends with its final movement, which in this case is the fourth movement, \"Finale: Allegro con fuoco\".\n\n**Step 2: Consult the Musical Score**\nTo find the notes, we must refer to the orchestral score. The first violin (Violino I) part is typically located at the top of the string section in the score.\n\n**Step 3: Locate the Final Measures**\nNavigating to the end of the fourth movement, we find the concluding bars. The piece ends with a grand, triumphant flourish (marked \"Grandioso\"). We need to identify the last three distinct notes played sequentially by the first violins.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Last Three Notes**\nLooking at the final three measures of the first violin part:\n1.  The third-to-last note is an **F-sharp** (F♯). In standard pitch notation, this is F♯5.\n2.  The second-to-last note is a **D**. In standard pitch notation, this is D5.\n3.  The very last note of the symphony for the first violin is a long, held **B**. In standard pitch notation, this is B4.\n\nSo, the sequence of the last three notes is F♯5, D5, B4.\n\n**Step 5: Compare the Pitches**\nNow we compare these three notes to find the lowest one:\n*   F♯5 (F-sharp in the 5th octave)\n*   D5 (D in the 5th octave)\n*   B4 (B in the 4th octave)\n\nWhen comparing pitches, a note with a lower octave number is always lower. Therefore, B4 is lower than both D5 and F♯5.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe last three notes played by the first violin are F-sharp, D, and B. Of these three, B is the lowest in pitch.\n\n<<<B>>>"
