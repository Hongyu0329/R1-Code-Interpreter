    "**Step-by-step analysis of the question:**\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to find the greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of two given 2x2 polynomial matrices, P1(s) and P2(s).\n\n2.  **Define GCRD:**\n    *   A matrix R(s) is a **right divisor** of P(s) if P(s) = Q(s)R(s) for some polynomial matrix Q(s).\n    *   A matrix G(s) is a **common right divisor** of P1(s) and P2(s) if it is a right divisor of both.\n    *   A matrix G(s) is a **GCRD** if it's a common right divisor, and any other common right divisor D(s) is a right divisor of G(s) (i.e., G(s) = L(s)D(s) for some polynomial matrix L(s)).\n    *   The GCRD is unique only up to left-multiplication by a unimodular matrix (a square polynomial matrix with a constant non-zero determinant).\n\n3.  **Choose a Method:** A standard method to find the GCRD is to use a procedure analogous to the Euclidean algorithm. This involves forming a stacked matrix and reducing it using elementary row operations.\n\n4.  **Form the Stacked Matrix:** We stack the two matrices P1 and P2 to form a single 4x2 matrix M(s).\n    M(s) = [ P1(s) ]\n           [ P2(s) ]\n\n    M(s) =\n    Row 1: [ s^2 + s   -s      ]\n    Row 2: [ -s^2 - 1  s^2     ]\n    Row 3: [ s         0       ]\n    Row 4: [ -s - 1    1       ]\n\n5.  **Perform Elementary Row Operations:** The goal is to apply elementary row operations (which correspond to left-multiplication by a unimodular matrix) to transform M(s) into a form where two rows are zero and the other two rows form the GCRD.\n\n6.  **Identify Careful Points:**\n    *   Elementary row operations for polynomial matrices include swapping rows, multiplying a row by a non-zero constant, and adding a *polynomial* multiple of one row to another. Division by a non-constant polynomial is not allowed.\n    *   The choice of pivot is crucial for an efficient calculation. Elements with the lowest degree, especially constants like '1', make excellent pivots.\n    *   If the resulting GCRD is a unimodular matrix, it means the original matrices P1 and P2 are **right coprime**. In this case, the identity matrix I is also a valid GCRD and is often the preferred representation.\n\n---\n**Acquiring the Final Answer with Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n**Step 1: Set up the matrix for reduction.**\nLet's start with the stacked matrix M(s):\nM(s) =\nR1: [ s^2 + s   -s      ]\nR2: [ -s^2 - 1  s^2     ]\nR3: [ s         0       ]\nR4: [ -s - 1    1       ]\n\n**Step 2: Choose an optimal pivot.**\nThe element in Row 4, Column 2 is `1`. This is the best pivot to start with as it allows us to eliminate the other entries in Column 2 without introducing fractions.\n\n**Step 3: Eliminate other elements in Column 2 using R4.**\n*   **Perform R1 → R1 + s * R4:**\n    [ (s^2 + s) + s*(-s - 1),  -s + s*(1) ] = [ s^2 + s - s^2 - s, 0 ] = [ 0, 0 ]. Let's call this new row R1'.\n*   **Perform R2 → R2 - s^2 * R4:**\n    [ (-s^2 - 1) - s^2*(-s - 1),  s^2 - s^2*(1) ] = [ -s^2 - 1 + s^3 + s^2, 0 ] = [ s^3 - 1, 0 ]. Let's call this new row R2'.\n*   R3 does not need to be changed as its second element is already zero.\n\n**Step 4: Update the matrix.**\nThe matrix M(s) is now transformed into M'(s):\nM'(s) =\nR1': [ 0         0       ]\nR2': [ s^3 - 1   0       ]\nR3:  [ s         0       ]\nR4:  [ -s - 1    1       ]\n\n**Step 5: Reduce the rows that have a zero in Column 2.**\nWe now focus on R2' and R3. This sub-problem is equivalent to finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the polynomials `s^3 - 1` and `s` using the Euclidean algorithm.\n*   Divide `s^3 - 1` by `s`: (s^3 - 1) = s^2 * (s) - 1. The remainder is -1.\n*   We can represent this division as a row operation: **R2' → R2' - s^2 * R3**.\n    [ (s^3 - 1) - s^2*(s), 0 - s^2*(0) ] = [ -1, 0 ]. Let's call this new row R2''.\n\n**Step 6: Update the matrix again.**\nThe matrix is now M''(s):\nM''(s) =\nR1': [ 0         0       ]\nR2'': [ -1        0       ]\nR3:  [ s         0       ]\nR4:  [ -s - 1    1       ]\n\n**Step 7: Use the new pivot in R2'' to simplify further.**\nThe element `-1` in R2'' is an excellent pivot to eliminate other elements in Column 1.\n*   **Perform R3 → R3 + s * R2'':**\n    [ s + s*(-1), 0 + s*(0) ] = [ 0, 0 ]. Let's call this new row R3'.\n*   **Perform R4 → R4 - (s + 1) * R2'':**\n    [ (-s - 1) - (s + 1)*(-1), 1 - (s + 1)*(0) ] = [ -s - 1 + s + 1, 1 ] = [ 0, 1 ]. Let's call this new row R4'.\n\n**Step 8: Final reduced matrix.**\nThe matrix is now M'''(s):\nM'''(s) =\nR1': [ 0   0 ]\nR2'':[ -1  0 ]\nR3': [ 0   0 ]\nR4': [ 0   1 ]\n\n**Step 9: Identify the GCRD.**\nThe non-zero rows form the GCRD. By arranging them, we get:\nG(s) = [ -1  0 ]\n       [ 0   1 ]\n\nThe determinant of this matrix is `(-1)*(1) - 0*0 = -1`, which is a non-zero constant. Therefore, G(s) is a unimodular matrix.\n\nSince the GCRD is unimodular, the matrices P1(s) and P2(s) are right coprime. By convention, the simplest representation for the GCRD of right coprime matrices is the identity matrix, `I`. We can obtain `I` from our G(s) by a unimodular transformation (e.g., multiplying the first row by -1), so `I` is also a valid GCRD.\n\n<<<[1, 0; 0, 1]>>>"
