    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Parametric Curve:**\n    The curve is defined piecewise based on the parameter `t`. We need to understand the shape of each piece.\n    *   **Piece 1: For `t \\in [0, \\pi]`**\n        The equations are $x = \\cos t$ and $y = \\sin t$ (since $b=1$). This is the standard parametric representation of the unit circle, $x^2 + y^2 = 1$. As `t` goes from 0 to $\\pi$, $\\cos t$ goes from 1 to -1, and $\\sin t$ is always non-negative. This traces the upper semi-circle of the unit circle, from point (1, 0) to (-1, 0).\n    *   **Piece 2: For `t \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)`**\n        The equations are $x = \\cos t$ and $y = 5\\sin t$ (since $b=5$). This corresponds to the ellipse defined by the equation $x^2 + (y/5)^2 = 1$, or $x^2 + y^2/25 = 1$. As `t` goes from $\\pi$ to $2\\pi$, $\\cos t$ goes from -1 to 1, and $\\sin t$ is always negative. This traces the lower semi-ellipse, from a point approaching (-1, 0) to a point approaching (1, 0). The lowest point is at $t=3\\pi/2$, which is $(0, 5\\sin(3\\pi/2)) = (0, -5)$.\n\n2.  **Determine the Extents (Bounding Box) of the Figure:**\n    To find the smallest square that encloses the figure, we first need to find the overall dimensions of the figure.\n    *   **X-dimension (Width):** For both pieces, the x-coordinate is given by $x = \\cos t$. As `t` varies from 0 to $2\\pi$, the cosine function covers its full range of values from -1 to 1.\n        *   Maximum x-value: $x_{max} = 1$\n        *   Minimum x-value: $x_{min} = -1$\n        *   Width of the figure = $x_{max} - x_{min} = 1 - (-1) = 2$.\n    *   **Y-dimension (Height):** We need to consider the range of y-values from both pieces.\n        *   From the upper semi-circle, $y = \\sin t$ ranges from 0 to 1.\n        *   From the lower semi-ellipse, $y = 5\\sin t$ ranges from -5 to 0.\n        *   Combining these, the total range for y is from -5 to 1.\n        *   Maximum y-value: $y_{max} = 1$\n        *   Minimum y-value: $y_{min} = -5$\n        *   Height of the figure = $y_{max} - y_{min} = 1 - (-5) = 6$.\n\n3.  **Determine the Smallest Enclosing Square:**\n    The figure is contained within a rectangular region (the bounding box) defined by $-1 \\le x \\le 1$ and $-5 \\le y \\le 1$. This rectangle has a width of 2 and a height of 6.\n    The smallest square that can enclose this rectangle must have a side length equal to the larger of these two dimensions.\n    *   Side length of the square, S = $\\max(\\text{Width}, \\text{Height}) = \\max(2, 6) = 6$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Area of the Square:**\n    The area of a square is the square of its side length.\n    *   Area = $S^2 = 6^2 = 36$.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Understanding the piecewise definition:** It's crucial to analyze the two parts of the curve separately and then combine their extents.\n*   **Interpretation of \"outcircles\":** This term is not standard. In geometric problems, unless rotation is explicitly allowed, \"smallest enclosing square\" refers to the smallest axis-aligned square. This is the most straightforward and common interpretation. A more complex interpretation involving rotated squares would likely be specified more clearly.\n*   **Finding the bounding box:** Carefully determine the minimum and maximum values for both x and y coordinates over the entire range of the parameter `t`. For `y`, this involves combining the ranges from both pieces of the curve.\n*   **Square side length:** The side of the smallest axis-aligned square that contains a rectangle is determined by the longer side of the rectangle.\n\nBy following these steps, we arrive at the final answer.\n\n<<<36>>>"
