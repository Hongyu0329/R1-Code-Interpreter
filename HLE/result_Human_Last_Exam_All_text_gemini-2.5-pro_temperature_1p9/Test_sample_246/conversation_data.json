    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the minimal number of generators of the fundamental group of the double branched cover of $S^4$ over the 5-twist-spun knot of the trefoil.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the object and its fundamental group\n\nLet $K$ be the trefoil knot ($3_1$) in $S^3$.\nLet $K_5$ be the 5-twist-spun knot of the trefoil. This is a knotted 2-sphere embedded in $S^4$.\nLet $M$ be the double branched cover of $S^4$ branched over $K_5$. This is a closed, orientable 4-manifold. We want to find the minimal number of generators of its fundamental group, $\\pi_1(M)$.\n\nThe calculation of $\\pi_1(M)$ relies on a sequence of standard results in knot theory and low-dimensional topology.\n\n1.  **Fundamental group of the knot complement:** Let $G_K = \\pi_1(S^3 \\setminus K)$ be the fundamental group of the trefoil knot complement. A standard presentation for the trefoil group is $G_K = \\langle a, b \\mid aba=bab \\rangle$. The generators $a$ and $b$ can be chosen to be meridians of the knot. The minimal number of generators for this group, denoted $d(G_K)$, is 2, since its abelianization is $G_K/[G_K, G_K] \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n2.  **Fundamental group of the twist-spun knot complement:** The fundamental group of the complement of the $m$-twist-spun knot $K_m$ in $S^4$ is given by an HNN extension of $G_K$.\n    $\\pi_1(S^4 \\setminus K_m) = \\langle G_K, t \\mid t g t^{-1} = \\phi_m(g) \\text{ for all } g \\in G_K \\rangle$,\n    where $\\phi_m$ is the automorphism of $G_K$ given by conjugation by the $m$-th power of a meridian $\\mu$. Let's choose the meridian $\\mu=a$. So, $\\phi_m(g) = a^m g a^{-m}$. For our case, $m=5$.\n\n3.  **Fundamental group of the double branched cover:** The double branched cover $M$ of $S^4$ over $K_5$ has a fundamental group $\\pi_1(M)$ which is a subgroup of $\\pi_1(S^4 \\setminus K_5)$. Specifically, there is a homomorphism $\\rho: \\pi_1(S^4 \\setminus K_5) \\to \\mathbb{Z}_2$ that sends the meridian of the 2-knot $K_5$ to the non-trivial element. The generator $t$ of the HNN extension represents a loop that links $K_5$ once, so it is a meridian. Loops in $G_K$ do not link $K_5$. So we have $\\rho(t)=-1$ and $\\rho(g)=1$ for all $g \\in G_K$. The fundamental group $\\pi_1(M)$ is the kernel of this homomorphism, $\\ker(\\rho)$.\n\nUsing the Reidemeister-Schreier method, we can find a presentation for this kernel. The result of this standard computation gives another HNN extension, this time corresponding to the automorphism $\\phi_{2m}$.\nThe group is:\n$\\pi_1(M) = \\langle G_K, \\tau \\mid \\tau g \\tau^{-1} = \\phi_{2m}(g) \\text{ for all } g \\in G_K \\rangle$.\nWith $m=5$ and $\\mu=a$, this becomes:\n$\\pi_1(M) = \\langle G_K, \\tau \\mid \\tau g \\tau^{-1} = a^{10} g a^{-10} \\rangle$.\n\nSince $G_K = \\langle a, b \\mid aba=bab \\rangle$, the presentation for $\\pi_1(M)$ is:\n$\\pi_1(M) = \\langle a, b, \\tau \\mid aba=bab, \\tau a \\tau^{-1} = a^{10}a a^{-10}, \\tau b \\tau^{-1} = a^{10}b a^{-10} \\rangle$.\nThe relation $\\tau a \\tau^{-1} = a^{10}a a^{-10}$ simplifies to $\\tau a \\tau^{-1} = a$, which means $\\tau$ and $a$ commute.\nSo, the fundamental group is $H = \\langle a, b, \\tau \\mid aba=bab, a\\tau=\\tau a, \\tau b \\tau^{-1} = a^{10}b a^{-10} \\rangle$.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the structure of the group $\\pi_1(M)$\n\nThe group structure of $H = \\pi_1(M)$ can be recognized as a semidirect product.\nLet $K = G_K = \\langle a, b \\mid aba=bab \\rangle$.\nLet $\\alpha: K \\to K$ be the automorphism defined by $\\alpha(g) = a^{10} g a^{-10}$. We must check this is a valid automorphism. We only need to check it preserves the relation $aba=bab$.\n$\\alpha(a)\\alpha(b)\\alpha(a) = (a^{10}aa^{-10})(a^{10}ba^{-10})(a^{10}aa^{-10}) = a(a^{10}ba^{-10})a = a^{11}ba^{-9}$.\n$\\alpha(b)\\alpha(a)\\alpha(b) = (a^{10}ba^{-10})(a^{10}aa^{-10})(a^{10}ba^{-10}) = (a^{10}ba^{-10}) a (a^{10}ba^{-10}) = a^{10}b a b a^{-10}$.\nWe check if $a^{11}ba^{-9} = a^{10}bab a^{-10}$ holds in $K$.\nMultiply by $a^{-10}$ on the left and $a^{10}$ on the right:\n$a b a = b a b$.\nThis is the relation in $K$, so it holds. $\\alpha$ is a valid automorphism.\nThe group $H$ is therefore the semidirect product $H \\cong K \\rtimes_\\alpha \\mathbb{Z}$, where the generator of $\\mathbb{Z}$ acts on $K$ via the automorphism $\\alpha$.\n\n### Step 3: Compute the minimal number of generators, $d(H)$\n\nThe minimal number of generators of a group $G$, denoted $d(G)$, is at least the minimal number of generators of its abelianization, $d(G_{ab})$.\nLet's compute the abelianization $H_{ab} = H/[H,H]$.\nThe generators $a, b, \\tau$ are made to commute.\n1.  $aba=bab \\implies a^2b = ab^2 \\implies a=b$ in the abelianization.\n2.  $a\\tau=\\tau a$ is already abelian.\n3.  $\\tau b \\tau^{-1} = a^{10}b a^{-10} \\implies b=b$ in the abelianization.\nSo the abelian group $H_{ab}$ is generated by the images of $a$ and $\\tau$, with no other relations between them.\n$H_{ab} \\cong \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}$.\nThe minimal number of generators for $\\mathbb{Z}^2$ is 2. Therefore, $d(H) \\ge 2$.\n\nTo determine if $d(H)$ is 2, we can use a theorem by J. Wiegold. For a semidirect product $G = K \\rtimes_\\phi C$ where $C$ is an infinite cyclic group, $d(G) = d(K)$ if and only if $\\phi(K)K' = K$, where $K'$ is the commutator subgroup of $K$. This condition is equivalent to the induced automorphism $\\phi_*: K_{ab} \\to K_{ab}$ being surjective.\n\nLet's check this condition for our group $H = K \\rtimes_\\alpha \\mathbb{Z}$.\n-   $K = G_{3_1}$, the trefoil group. Its abelianization is $K_{ab} = K/K' \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$, generated by the image of $a$ (or $b$, since they become equal).\n-   $\\alpha$ is the automorphism $\\alpha(g) = a^{10}g a^{-10}$.\n-   The induced map $\\alpha_*: K_{ab} \\to K_{ab}$ maps the generator $[a]$ to $[\\alpha(a)] = [a^{10}aa^{-10}]=[a]$. Since $\\alpha_*$ maps the generator to itself, it is the identity map on $K_{ab}$.\n-   The identity map is surjective. So, the condition $\\alpha_*(K_{ab}) = K_{ab}$ is satisfied.\n\nAccording to Wiegold's theorem, we have $d(H) = d(K)$.\nThe minimal number of generators for the trefoil group $K=G_{3_1}$ is $d(K)=2$.\n\nTherefore, the minimal number of generators for $\\pi_1(M)$ is 2.\n\nFinal conclusion: $d(\\pi_1(M)) = 2$.\n\n<<<2>>>"
