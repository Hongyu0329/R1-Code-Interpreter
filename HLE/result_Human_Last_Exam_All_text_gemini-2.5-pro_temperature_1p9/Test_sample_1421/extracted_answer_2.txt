The formula for the fermionic partition function $Z$ in the imaginary time path integral formalism is $Z = \int \mathcal{D}\bar{\psi} \mathcal{D}\psi \exp\left(-\int_0^\beta d\tau \left[ \bar{\psi}(\tau) \partial_\tau \psi(\tau) + H(\bar{\psi}(\tau), \psi(\tau)) \right]\right)$, where the integral is over all Grassmann fields that satisfy the anti-periodic boundary condition $\psi(\beta) = -\psi(0)$. For a non-interacting system with a quadratic Hamiltonian matrix $h$, this simplifies to $Z = \det(\partial_\tau + h)$.
