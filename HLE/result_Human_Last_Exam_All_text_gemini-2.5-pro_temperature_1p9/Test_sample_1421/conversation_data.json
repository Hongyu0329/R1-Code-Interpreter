    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the formula for the fermionic partition function in the imaginary time path integral formalism.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: The Starting Point - The Partition Function in Quantum Statistical Mechanics**\n\nThe fundamental definition of the canonical partition function ($Z$) for any quantum system in thermal equilibrium at a temperature $T$ is given by the trace of the statistical operator:\n\n$Z = \\text{Tr}(e^{-\\beta \\hat{H}})$\n\nwhere:\n*   $\\hat{H}$ is the Hamiltonian operator of the system.\n*   $\\beta = 1/(k_B T)$ is the inverse temperature ($k_B$ is Boltzmann's constant).\n*   $\\text{Tr}(\\cdot)$ denotes the trace, which is a sum over a complete set of states in the system's Hilbert space. For fermions, this is the fermionic Fock space.\n\n**Step 2: The Path Integral Approach - Slicing Imaginary Time**\n\nThe core idea of Feynman's path integral is to evaluate the trace by breaking the imaginary time evolution operator $e^{-\\beta \\hat{H}}$ into a large number $N$ of small steps.\n\n$e^{-\\beta \\hat{H}} = (e^{-\\epsilon \\hat{H}})^N$, where $\\epsilon = \\beta/N$.\n\nWe then insert a complete set of states between each of these small steps.\n$Z = \\text{Tr}((e^{-\\epsilon \\hat{H}})^N) = \\sum_{\\psi_0} \\langle \\psi_0 | (e^{-\\epsilon \\hat{H}}) \\cdots (e^{-\\epsilon \\hat{H}}) | \\psi_0 \\rangle$\n\n**Step 3: A Crucial Point for Fermions - Grassmann Variables**\n\nUnlike bosons, fermions are described by operators that anti-commute: $\\{\\hat{\\psi}_i, \\hat{\\psi}_j^\\dagger \\} = \\delta_{ij}$ and $\\{\\hat{\\psi}_i, \\hat{\\psi}_j \\} = \\{\\hat{\\psi}_i^\\dagger, \\hat{\\psi}_j^\\dagger \\} = 0$. To represent the eigenvalues of these operators in a path integral, we cannot use ordinary numbers. We must introduce **Grassmann numbers** (anti-commuting numbers).\n\n*   **Definition:** For any two Grassmann numbers $\\eta_1, \\eta_2$, their product anti-commutes: $\\eta_1 \\eta_2 = -\\eta_2 \\eta_1$.\n*   **Consequence:** The square of any Grassmann number is zero: $\\eta^2 = 0$. This mathematically represents the Pauli Exclusion Principle (no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state).\n\nWe use these Grassmann numbers, $\\psi$ and $\\bar{\\psi}$, to define \"fermionic coherent states,\" which are the states we insert at each time slice.\n\n**Step 4: Constructing the Action**\n\nBy inserting complete sets of fermionic coherent states at each time slice and taking the limit as $N \\to \\infty$ ($\\epsilon \\to 0$), the product of matrix elements turns into an integral of an exponential. The exponent is called the **Euclidean action**, $S_E$.\n\nThe resulting action for a system of fermions described by fields $\\psi(\\tau)$ and $\\bar{\\psi}(\\tau)$ is:\n\n$S_E[\\bar{\\psi}, \\psi] = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\left[ \\sum_i \\bar{\\psi}_i(\\tau) \\partial_\\tau \\psi_i(\\tau) + H(\\bar{\\psi}(\\tau), \\psi(\\tau)) \\right]$\n\nHere:\n*   $\\tau$ is the imaginary time variable, from $0$ to $\\beta$.\n*   $\\bar{\\psi}(\\tau)$ and $\\psi(\\tau)$ are independent Grassmann-valued fields representing the fermions.\n*   The term $\\bar{\\psi}\\partial_\\tau\\psi$ is the \"kinetic\" term arising from the overlap of coherent states at adjacent time slices.\n*   $H(\\bar{\\psi}(\\tau), \\psi(\\tau))$ is the classical Hamiltonian function corresponding to the normal-ordered operator $\\hat{H}$, where creation and annihilation operators have been replaced by the Grassmann fields $\\bar{\\psi}$ and $\\psi$.\n\n**Step 5: A Second Crucial Point - Anti-Periodic Boundary Conditions**\n\nWhen evaluating the trace for fermions, a peculiarity arises from the anti-commuting nature of the fields. To correctly calculate the trace $\\sum_{\\psi_0} \\langle -\\psi_0 | \\dots |\\psi_0\\rangle$, the field at the beginning of the imaginary time interval must be the negative of the field at the end.\n\nThis imposes **anti-periodic boundary conditions** on the Grassmann fields:\n\n$\\psi(\\tau = \\beta) = -\\psi(\\tau = 0)$\n\nThis is a defining feature of the fermionic path integral at finite temperature and distinguishes it sharply from the bosonic case, which has periodic boundary conditions.\n\n**Step 6: The Final Formula**\n\nCombining all the pieces, the partition function is expressed as a functional integral over all possible anti-periodic Grassmann field configurations:\n\n$Z = \\int_{\\psi(\\beta) = -\\psi(0)} \\mathcal{D}\\bar{\\psi} \\mathcal{D}\\psi \\, e^{-S_E[\\bar{\\psi}, \\psi]}$\n\nwhere:\n*   $\\mathcal{D}\\bar{\\psi} \\mathcal{D}\\psi$ is the functional integration measure, representing the product of differentials for all fields at all points in imaginary time.\n*   The subscript on the integral sign explicitly notes the anti-periodic boundary conditions.\n\n**Step 7: A Third Crucial Point - Evaluating the Integral (The Determinant)**\n\nFor a non-interacting system, the Hamiltonian is quadratic, for example, $\\hat{H} = \\sum_{ij} \\hat{\\psi}_i^\\dagger h_{ij} \\hat{\\psi}_j$. The action becomes a quadratic form:\n\n$S_E = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\sum_{ij} \\bar{\\psi}_i(\\tau) (\\delta_{ij}\\partial_\\tau + h_{ij}) \\psi_j(\\tau) = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\, \\bar{\\psi} (\\partial_\\tau + h) \\psi$\n\nDue to the rules of Grassmann integration (Berezin integral), this Gaussian integral evaluates to the **determinant** of the operator in the action, not its inverse (as in the bosonic case).\n\n$Z = \\det(\\partial_\\tau + h)$\n\nThe determinant is evaluated over the function space with anti-periodic boundary conditions. In practice, this is done by expanding in a Fourier series (Matsubara expansion). The anti-periodic boundary condition dictates that the allowed frequencies must be **fermionic Matsubara frequencies**:\n$\\omega_n = \\frac{(2n+1)\\pi}{\\beta}$, where $n$ is any integer.\n\nIn this frequency basis, the operator $\\partial_\\tau$ becomes $-i\\omega_n$, so the partition function becomes:\n\n$Z = \\prod_n \\det_s(-i\\omega_n + h)$\nwhere $\\det_s$ is the determinant over the single-particle state space (the space on which the matrix $h$ acts).\n\n---\n### Final Answer\n\nThe formula for the fermionic partition function $Z$ in the imaginary time path integral formalism is given by a functional integral over anti-commuting Grassmann fields $\\psi(\\tau)$ and $\\bar{\\psi}(\\tau)$:\n\n$Z = \\int \\mathcal{D}\\bar{\\psi} \\mathcal{D}\\psi \\exp\\left(-\\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\left[ \\bar{\\psi}(\\tau) (\\partial_\\tau)\\psi(\\tau) + H(\\bar{\\psi}(\\tau), \\psi(\\tau)) \\right]\\right)$\n\nThis integral is performed subject to **anti-periodic boundary conditions** in imaginary time $\\tau$:\n$\\psi(\\beta) = -\\psi(0)$ and $\\bar{\\psi}(\\beta) = -\\bar{\\psi}(0)$\n\nFor a non-interacting system described by a single-particle Hamiltonian matrix $h$, this integral evaluates to the functional determinant of the operator $(\\partial_\\tau + h)$:\n\n$Z = \\det(\\partial_\\tau + h) = \\prod_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\det_s(-i\\omega_n + h)$\n\nwhere $\\det_s$ is the determinant over the single-particle state space, and $\\omega_n = \\frac{(2n+1)\\pi}{\\beta}$ are the fermionic Matsubara frequencies.\n\n<<<The formula for the fermionic partition function $Z$ in the imaginary time path integral formalism is $Z = \\int \\mathcal{D}\\bar{\\psi} \\mathcal{D}\\psi \\exp\\left(-\\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\left[ \\bar{\\psi}(\\tau) \\partial_\\tau \\psi(\\tau) + H(\\bar{\\psi}(\\tau), \\psi(\\tau)) \\right]\\right)$, where the integral is over all Grassmann fields that satisfy the anti-periodic boundary condition $\\psi(\\beta) = -\\psi(0)$. For a non-interacting system with a quadratic Hamiltonian matrix $h$, this simplifies to $Z = \\det(\\partial_\\tau + h)$.>>>"
