    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Define the function F₃(x)**\nWe are given a sequence of functions:\n*   F₀(x) = x\n*   F₁(x) = sin(F₀(x)) = sin(x)\n*   F₂(x) = e^(F₁(x)) = e^(sin(x))\n*   F₃(x) = ln(1 + F₂(x)) = ln(1 + e^(sin(x)))\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Integrand**\nThe question asks to evaluate the integral of `F₃'(x) / F₃(x)`.\nThis expression is in the form `u'/u`, where `u = F₃(x)`. The integral of `u'/u` with respect to x is a standard result:\n∫ (u'(x) / u(x)) dx = ln|u(x)| + C\n\nSo, the indefinite integral is:\n∫ (F₃'(x) / F₃(x)) dx = ln|F₃(x)| + C\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the Definite Integral**\nWe need to evaluate the integral from 0 to 1. Using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus:\n∫ (from 0 to 1) [F₃'(x) / F₃(x)] dx = [ln|F₃(x)|] (from x=0 to x=1)\n= ln|F₃(1)| - ln|F₃(0)|\n\nThis can also be written using logarithm properties as:\n= ln( |F₃(1)| / |F₃(0)| )\n\n**Step 4: Calculate F₃(0) and F₃(1)**\nFirst, we find the value of F₃(x) at the lower limit, x = 0:\n*   F₃(0) = ln(1 + e^(sin(0)))\n*   sin(0) = 0\n*   e⁰ = 1\n*   F₃(0) = ln(1 + 1) = ln(2)\n\nNext, we find the value of F₃(x) at the upper limit, x = 1 (note: the argument of sin is in radians):\n*   F₃(1) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))\n\n**Step 5: Check the signs of F₃(0) and F₃(1)**\nWe need to determine if we can remove the absolute value signs.\n*   For F₃(0): ln(2) ≈ 0.693, which is positive. So, |F₃(0)| = F₃(0) = ln(2).\n*   For F₃(1): The angle 1 radian is in the first quadrant (0 < 1 < π/2), so sin(1) is positive. This means e^(sin(1)) > e⁰ = 1. Therefore, 1 + e^(sin(1)) > 2, and ln(1 + e^(sin(1))) > ln(2), which is positive. So, |F₃(1)| = F₃(1).\n\nThe value of the integral, V, is:\nV = ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0))\nV = ln(ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))) - ln(ln(2))\n\nUsing the logarithm property `ln(a) - ln(b) = ln(a/b)`:\nV = ln[ (ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))) / ln(2) ]\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the Numerical Value of V**\nWe now compute the numerical value using a calculator, keeping several decimal places for accuracy.\n*   sin(1) ≈ 0.841471\n*   e^(sin(1)) ≈ e^0.841471 ≈ 2.320117\n*   F₃(1) = ln(1 + 2.320117) = ln(3.320117) ≈ 1.200004\n*   F₃(0) = ln(2) ≈ 0.693147\n\nNow substitute these values back into the expression for V:\nV = ln( F₃(1) / F₃(0) )\nV = ln( 1.200004 / 0.693147 )\nV = ln(1.731253)\nV ≈ 0.548846\n\n**Step 7: Final Calculation**\nThe problem asks for the closest integer to 10000 * V.\n*   10000 * V ≈ 10000 * 0.548846\n*   10000 * V ≈ 5488.46\n\nThe closest integer to 5488.46 is 5488."
