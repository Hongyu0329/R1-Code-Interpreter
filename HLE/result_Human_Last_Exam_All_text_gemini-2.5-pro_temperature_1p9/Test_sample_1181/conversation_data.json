    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The core of the question is to identify a specific character from the 1972 film *Solaris* based on a particular line of dialogue or sentiment: being \"ashamed to miss the sound of leaves rustling on Earth.\" This points to a character who is not only homesick but also reflective about that feeling, seeing it almost as a weakness or a contradiction to their role as a space explorer.\n\n2.  **Recall the Film's Plot and Characters:**\n    *   **Kris Kelvin:** The protagonist psychologist sent to the station. He is deeply connected to his past on Earth, especially through memories of his wife, Hari, and his father's home. The film opens with him on Earth, surrounded by nature.\n    *   **Hari:** Kris's deceased wife, recreated by the Solaris ocean. She is a \"visitor\" and not human. She wouldn't have authentic memories of Earth to miss. Her struggle is with her own identity and existence.\n    *   **Snaut:** One of the two surviving scientists. He is weary, cynical, and highly philosophical, often acting as a guide who explains the station's strange reality to Kris.\n    *   **Sartorius:** The other scientist. He is cold, rational, and obsessed with a purely scientific approach to Solaris, viewing emotional responses as contamination.\n    *   **Gibarian:** A scientist who committed suicide before Kris's arrival. He appears in video logs and visions, expressing despair.\n\n3.  **Locate the Specific Dialogue/Scene:** The sentiment in question is part of a famous monologue. The character explains the paradox of space exploration, stating that humanity isn't truly seeking other worlds, but rather a \"mirror\" of itself. Within this speech, he says:\n\n    > \"You know, in a way, I am ashamed to be missing the rustle of leaves.\"\n\n4.  **Attribute the Dialogue to the Correct Character:** This philosophical monologue is delivered by **Dr. Snaut** to Kris Kelvin. It serves as a cornerstone of the film's themes. Snaut has been on the station for a long time and has had years to contemplate the futility and irony of their mission. His shame comes from the realization that for all their cosmic ambition, what he truly longs for is a simple, terrestrial experience, a feeling that seems beneath the dignity of a pioneer of the universe.\n\n5.  **Evaluate Other Options:**\n    *   Kris feels the loss of Earth deeply, but he is the *recipient* of this monologue, not its speaker. Snaut is verbalizing a complex feeling that Kris is only beginning to grapple with.\n    *   Sartorius is the antithesis of this sentiment. He would see such a feeling as a weakness and would be the last person to admit it.\n    *   Hari has no Earth to miss.\n    *   Gibarian is deceased, and his messages are of warning and personal torment, not this specific philosophical reflection.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Film vs. Novel:** The question is specifically about Andrei Tarkovsky's 1972 film. This particular dialogue and its deep philosophical bent are characteristic of Tarkovsky's adaptation and are not present in the same way in Stanis≈Çaw Lem's original novel.\n*   **The Speaker's Role:** The character who says this is not just being homesick; they are articulating a complex critique of humanity's ambitions. It is a moment of profound insight from the station's resident philosopher, Snaut.\n*   **Protagonist vs. Speaker:** It's common to attribute a film's central ideas to its protagonist. However, in *Solaris*, many of the most important philosophical statements are made by the supporting characters, particularly Snaut, to challenge and enlighten the protagonist, Kris.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nBased on the analysis, the character who says he is ashamed to miss the sound of rustling leaves is Dr. Snaut. This corresponds to answer choice C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
