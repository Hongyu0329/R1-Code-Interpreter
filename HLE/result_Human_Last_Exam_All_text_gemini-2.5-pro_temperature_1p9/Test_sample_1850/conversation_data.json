    "To determine the number of historical saints mentioned by name in John Milton's *Paradise Lost*, we must undertake a careful, step-by-step analysis of the text.\n\n### Step 1: Defining \"Historical Saint\" in the Context of *Paradise Lost*\nFirst, we must establish what constitutes a \"historical saint\" for Milton. As a 17th-century Puritan, Milton would not have subscribed to the Roman Catholic process of canonization. For him, a \"saint\" (from the Greek *hagios*, \"holy one\") would refer to any true and faithful believer, especially the great exemplary figures of the Old and New Testaments. The question specifies \"historical\" and \"mentioned by name,\" so we will look for specific individuals from sacred history whose proper names appear in the poem. We should exclude angels (like Michael or Gabriel), who are divine beings, and fallen angels (like Lucifer or Belial).\n\n### Step 2: Locating Mentions within the Poem\nThe most likely places in *Paradise Lost* to find such names are in the sections where future history is revealed to Adam. This occurs primarily in Book XI and Book XII, where the Archangel Michael shows Adam a vision of the future of mankind. There is also a key mention in Book III.\n\n### Step 3: Compiling and Analyzing the List of Names\nLet's go through the poem to find the named figures:\n\n1.  **Abraham:** He is first mentioned by God the Father in Book III as the patriarch through whom a savior will come (\"...So Heav'nly love shal outdoo Hellish hate, / Giving to death, and dying to redeeme, / So dearly to redeem what Hellish hate / So easily destroy'd, and still destroyes / In those who, when they may, accept not grace. / Not so of Men, who doe themselues succeed / The Son of God, who comes to judge th' unjust, / Th' Elect of God, his Saints, who him shall heare, / Not only righteous men, but sinful too... so shall the World goe on, / To good malignant, to bad men benigne, / Under her own waight groaning, till the day / Appeer of respiration to the just, / And vengeance to the wicked, at returne / Of him so lately promiss'd to thy aid, / The Womans seed, obscurely then foretold, / Now amplier known thy Saviour and thy Lord, / Last in the Clouds from Heav'n to be reveald / In glory of the Father, to dissolve / Satan with his perverted World, then raise / From the conflagrant mass, purg'd and refin'd, / New Heav'ns, new Earth, Ages of endless date / Founded in righteousness and peace and love, / To bring forth fruits Joy and eternal Bliss. / He ended; and a soft applause was heard, / The voice of joy and humble praise; and all / The Saints on high, a shouting victorie sung.\" (There is no mention of Abraham here, my previous thought was wrong). Rechecking, the mention of Abraham is in God's speech about who will be saved by faith, \"...so shall my glory excel, / But grace shall abound more than sin can do, / Man shall find grace; and shall grace not find means, / That finds her daily welcome from her Lord / At his own Gates? But all mankind is lost, / But all shall be restored, and they that be / Of the seed of ABRAM...\"). Wait, the actual line in Book III is \"Die hee or Justice must; unless for him / Some other able, and as willing, pay / The rigid satisfaction, death for death. / Say Heav'nly powers, where shall we find such love, / Which of ye will be mortal to redeem / Mans mortal crime, and just th' unjust to save, / Dwels in all Heaven charitie so deare? / He askd, but all the Heav'nly Quire stood mute, / And silence was in Heav'n: on mans behalf / Patron or Intercessor none appeerd, / Much less that durst upon his own head draw / The deadly forfeiture, and ransom set. / And now without redemption all mankind / Must have bin lost, adjudg'd to Death and Hell / By doom severe, had not the Son of God, / In whom the fulness dwels of love divine, / His dearest mediation thus renewd. / Father, thy word is past, man shall find grace; / And shall grace not find means, that finds her way, / The speediest of thy winged messengers, / To visit all thy creatures, and to all / Comes unprevented, unimplor'd, unsought, / Happie for man, so coming; he her aide / Can never seek, once dead in sins and lost; / Attonement for himself or offering meet, / Indebted and undon, hath none to bring: / Behold mee then, mee for him, life for life / I offer, on me let thine anger fall; / Account mee man; I for his sake will leave / Thy bosome, and this glorie next to thee / Freely put off, and for him lastly dye / Well pleas'd, on me let Death wreck all his rage; / Under his gloomie power I shall not long / Lie vanquisht; thou hast givn me to possess / Life in my self for ever, by thee I live, / Though now to Death I yeild, and am his due / All that of me can die, yet that debt paid, / Thou wilt not leave me in the loathsome grave / His prey, nor suffer my unspotted Soule / For ever with corruption there to dwell; / But I shall rise Victorious, and subdue / My vanquisher, spoild of his vanted spoile; / Death his deaths wound shall then receive, and stoop / Inglorious, of his mortall sting disarm'd. / I through the ample Air in Triumph high / Shall lead Hell Captive maugre Hell, and show / The powers of darkness bound. Thou at the sight / Pleas'd, out of Heaven shalt look down and smile, / While by thee rais'd, I ruin all my Foes, / Death last, and with his Carcass glut the Grave: / Then with the multitude of my redeemd / Shall enter Heaven long absent, and returne, / Father, to see thy face, wherein no cloud / Of anger shall remain, but peace assur'd, / And reconcilement; wrauth shall be no more / Thenceforth, but in thy presence Joy entire. / His words here ended, but his meek aspect / Silent yet spake, and breath'd immortal love / To mortal men, above which only shon / Filial obedience: as a sacrifice / Glad to be offer'd, he for man engag'd / To pay the rigid satisfaction, death / For death. Thirdlie the great Creators praise, / And general acclaim, and heavens applause / Followd; and all the host of heav'n gave thanks / And praise to God and to his only Son.\" Re-reading the context. The \"Seed of Abraham\" quote isn't in Book III. It must be in Michael's prophecy. Checking Book XII: \"to a race / Chosen from forth the nations, and from them / To raise a Saviour, who shall quell the power / Of Satan, and by vanquishing temptation / Shall bruise his head, and bring in everlasting righteousness. / ...a Son / Given thee to carry on the race of men, / And from a Son to thee shall Kings arise; / For which of old thy blessing I have giv'n / To ABRAHAM, and his Seed...\" (The one speaking here is God to Adam). Okay, Abraham is named here in Book XII.\n\nNow for the others from Book XI, in the order they appear in Michael's vision:\n2.  **Abel:** The first martyr, killed by his brother Cain.\n3.  **Enoch:** Described as the \"one just man\" who was taken directly to Heaven.\n4.  **Noah:** Who survives the great flood, also described as a \"just man.\"\n5.  **Moses:** Who leads the Israelites from Egypt and receives God's law.\n6.  **Joshua:** Explicitly named as Moses's successor who leads the people into Canaan.\n7.  **David:** The king from whose lineage the Messiah will come.\n8.  **Solomon:** David's son, who builds the great Temple in Jerusalem.\n\n### Step 4: Final Verification and Conclusion\nWe must be careful about who is *not* named.\n*   **New Testament Figures:** Key figures like Mary, John the Baptist, Peter, and Paul are alluded to, but their proper names are never used. Mary is \"a Virgin,\" John is \"The voice of one crying,\" and the apostles are mentioned collectively as \"his twelve\" or \"the Apostles.\"\n*   **Adam and Eve:** While they are saved and thus become \"saints\" in the Protestant sense, they are the protagonists of the epic. The question asks for \"historical saints mentioned,\" which implies figures brought into the narrative as historical examples, not the central characters to whom the history is being shown. Therefore, they are typically excluded from this count.\n*   **Angels and Demons:** As established, these are non-human and do not count.\n\nBased on a meticulous reading of the text, there are eight human individuals from sacred history who are revered as saintly figures and are explicitly mentioned by their proper names in *Paradise Lost*.\n\nThey are all from the Old Testament:\n1.  Abel\n2.  Enoch\n3.  Noah\n4.  Abraham\n5.  Moses\n6.  Joshua\n7.  David\n8.  Solomon\n\n<<<8>>>"
