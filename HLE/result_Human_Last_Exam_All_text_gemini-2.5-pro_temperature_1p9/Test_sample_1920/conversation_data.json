    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters $\\chi$ of conductor $d = 53599$ and order $6$.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the conductor $d$\nThe first step is to find the prime factorization of the conductor $d = 53599$.\n1.  Check for small prime factors: $d$ is not divisible by 2, 3, or 5.\n2.  Try dividing by 7: $53599 \\div 7 = 7657$.\n3.  Now, we factorize 7657. Let's test prime divisors.\n    *   $7657 \\div 11 = 696.09...$\n    *   $7657 \\div 13 = 589$.\n4.  Finally, we factorize 589. The square root of 589 is approximately 24.2, so we test primes up to 23.\n    *   $589 \\div 19 = 31$.\nBoth 19 and 31 are prime numbers.\nThus, the prime factorization of the conductor is $d = 7 \\times 13 \\times 19 \\times 31$.\n\n**Careful Point:** The conductor $d$ is a product of four distinct primes. This is a crucial property, as it means $d$ is square-free.\n\n### Step 2: Decompose the Dirichlet Character\nFor a square-free conductor $d = p_1 p_2 \\dots p_r$, any Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $d$ can be uniquely expressed as a product of characters $\\chi_i$ modulo each prime factor:\n$\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\dots \\chi_r$\nIn our case, $d = 7 \\times 13 \\times 19 \\times 31$, so any character $\\chi \\pmod{53599}$ can be written as:\n$\\chi = \\chi_7 \\chi_{13} \\chi_{19} \\chi_{31}$\nwhere $\\chi_p$ is a Dirichlet character modulo $p$.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Conditions on the Character $\\chi$\n\nWe have two conditions on $\\chi$: it must be **primitive** with conductor $d$, and its **order** must be 6.\n\n1.  **Primitivity Condition:** A character $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\dots \\chi_r$ with a square-free conductor $d = p_1 p_2 \\dots p_r$ is primitive if and only if each of its component characters $\\chi_i$ is primitive modulo $p_i$. For a character $\\chi_p$ modulo a prime $p$, it is primitive if and only if it is not the principal character $\\chi_0$ (the character that is 1 for all inputs coprime to $p$). The principal character is the only character of order 1. Thus, for $\\chi$ to be primitive, each component $\\chi_p$ must have an order strictly greater than 1.\n\n2.  **Order Condition:** The order of the product character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters:\n    $\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_7), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{13}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{19}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{31}))$\n    We are given that $\\text{ord}(\\chi) = 6$.\n\n### Step 4: Determine the Possible Orders of Component Characters\n\nLet $k_p = \\text{ord}(\\chi_p)$.\n*   From the primitivity condition, $k_p > 1$ for each prime $p \\in \\{7, 13, 19, 31\\}$.\n*   From the order condition, $\\text{lcm}(k_7, k_{13}, k_{19}, k_{31}) = 6$. This implies that each $k_p$ must be a divisor of 6.\n*   The divisors of 6 are {1, 2, 3, 6}. Since $k_p > 1$, the possible orders for each component character are $k_p \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$.\n\nThe order of a character $\\chi_p$ must divide the order of the group $(\\mathbb{Z}/p\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$, which is $\\phi(p) = p-1$. Let's check if the orders {2, 3, 6} are valid for each component.\n*   For $p=7$: $\\phi(7) = 6$. Orders {2, 3, 6} are all divisors of 6.\n*   For $p=13$: $\\phi(13) = 12$. Orders {2, 3, 6} are all divisors of 12.\n*   For $p=19$: $\\phi(19) = 18$. Orders {2, 3, 6} are all divisors of 18.\n*   For $p=31$: $\\phi(31) = 30$. Orders {2, 3, 6} are all divisors of 30.\nSo, for each component $\\chi_p$, its order $k_p$ can be 2, 3, or 6.\n\n### Step 5: Count the Number of Component Characters for Each Valid Order\n\nThe number of characters modulo $p$ of a specific order $k$ (where $k$ divides $p-1$) is given by Euler's totient function, $\\phi(k)$.\nFor each of our primes $p \\in \\{7, 13, 19, 31\\}$, the number of characters for the possible orders are:\n*   Number of characters of order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$.\n*   Number of characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n*   Number of characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$.\n\n### Step 6: Count the Total Number of Valid Character Tuples\n\nWe need to count the number of tuples of characters $(\\chi_7, \\chi_{13}, \\chi_{19}, \\chi_{31})$ such that their orders $(k_7, k_{13}, k_{19}, k_{31})$ satisfy $\\text{lcm}(k_7, k_{13}, k_{19}, k_{31}) = 6$. We can solve this using the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion.\n\nLet $S$ be the set of all possible tuples of primitive characters $(\\chi_7, \\chi_{13}, \\chi_{19}, \\chi_{31})$ where the order of each component divides 6.\n*   For each component $\\chi_p$, the possible orders are {2, 3, 6}.\n*   The number of choices for each $\\chi_p$ is $\\phi(2) + \\phi(3) + \\phi(6) = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5$.\n*   Since there are 4 components, the total number of tuples in $S$ is $5 \\times 5 \\times 5 \\times 5 = 5^4 = 625$.\n\nNow, we must subtract the tuples where the lcm is not 6. The lcm of the orders will be a proper divisor of 6 if it divides 2 or if it divides 3.\n\n*   **Case A: lcm divides 3.** This happens if and only if the order of every component character divides 3. The only possible order greater than 1 is 3.\n    *   Number of choices for each $\\chi_p$ of order 3 is $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n    *   Number of such tuples = $2^4 = 16$.\n\n*   **Case B: lcm divides 2.** This happens if and only if the order of every component character divides 2. The only possible order greater than 1 is 2.\n    *   Number of choices for each $\\chi_p$ of order 2 is $\\phi(2) = 1$.\n    *   Number of such tuples = $1^4 = 1$.\n\n*   **Intersection:** The case where the lcm divides both 2 and 3 means it divides $\\gcd(2,3) = 1$. This would mean all characters have order 1, but we excluded those for primitivity. So the intersection is empty (size 0).\n\nBy the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion, the number of tuples where the lcm is exactly 6 is:\nTotal tuples in $S$ - (tuples with lcm dividing 3) - (tuples with lcm dividing 2)\n$= 625 - 16 - 1 = 608$.\n\nEach unique valid tuple of component characters $(\\chi_7, \\chi_{13}, \\chi_{19}, \\chi_{31})$ corresponds to a unique primitive Dirichlet character $\\chi$ of conductor $d$ and order 6.\n\nTherefore, the total number of such characters is 608.\n\n<<<608>>>"
