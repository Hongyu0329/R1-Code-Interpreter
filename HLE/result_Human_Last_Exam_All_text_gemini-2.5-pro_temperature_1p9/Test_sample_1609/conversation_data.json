    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the value of a(4).\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Core Concepts**\n\n*   **Boolean Function:** A function with `n` binary variables (inputs) that produces a single binary output (0 or 1). There are $2^{2^n}$ such functions for `n` variables.\n*   **Implicant:** A product term (an AND of literals, e.g., $x_1x_2'x_3$) is an implicant of a function `f` if, whenever the product term evaluates to 1, the function `f` also evaluates to 1. In a Karnaugh map (K-map), an implicant corresponds to any valid rectangular grouping of 1s.\n*   **Prime Implicant (PI):** An implicant is a prime implicant if it cannot be generalized further by removing a literal. If we remove any literal from a prime implicant, the resulting product term is no longer an implicant of the function. In a K-map, this corresponds to a rectangular grouping of 1s that is not fully contained within any single larger rectangular grouping of 1s.\n*   **a(n):** This term represents the **maximal number of prime implicants** that any Boolean function of `n` variables can have. To find a(n), one must find the specific function (or one of the functions) of `n` variables that has more prime implicants than any other function of `n` variables.\n\n### **Step 2: Analysis for Small Values of n**\n\nTo understand how the number of prime implicants can be maximized, let's analyze the cases for n=1, n=2, and n=3.\n\n*   **Case n=1:** The variables is $x$. The functions are $f=0, f=1, f=x, f=x'$.\n    *   For $f=0$, there are 0 PIs.\n    *   For $f=1$, there is 1 PI (the term '1').\n    *   For $f=x$, there is 1 PI (the term 'x').\n    *   For $f=x'$, there is 1 PI (the term 'x'').\n    The maximum is 1. So, **a(1) = 1**.\n\n*   **Case n=2:** The variables are $x, y$. A function that generates many PIs is the XOR function, $f = x \\oplus y = xy' + x'y$.\n    *   The two product terms, $xy'$ and $x'y$, are its prime implicants. You cannot remove any literals from them without invalidating them as implicants.\n    The maximum is 2. So, **a(2) = 2**.\n\n*   **Case n=3:** The variables are $x, y, z$. Let's consider the function `f` that is true for all input combinations *except* when all inputs are the same (i.e., not 000 and not 111).\n    *   This function can be expressed as: $f = (x+y+z)(x'+y'+z')$.\n    *   If we multiply this out to its Sum-of-Products form, we get:\n        $f = xy' + xz' + yx' + yz' + zx' + zy'$\n    *   Let's verify if $xy'$ is a prime implicant. It covers the minterms $xy'z$ (101) and $xy'z'$ (100). Both of these input combinations are in the function's ON-set (they are not 000 or 111). If we try to expand $xy'$ to just $x$, it would have to cover $xyz$ (111), which is not in the function's ON-set. If we expand to $y'$, it would have to cover $x'y'z'$ (000), also not in the ON-set. Thus, $xy'$ is a prime implicant.\n    *   By symmetry, all 6 terms in the expression are prime implicants.\n    This function has 6 prime implicants. This is known to be the maximum for n=3. So, **a(3) = 6**.\n\n### **Step 3: Analysis for n=4**\n\nFor `n=4`, we are looking for a(4). We could try extending the logic from n=3. Let's consider a function of 4 variables (w, x, y, z) that is true for all inputs except 0000 and 1111.\n*   $f = (w+x+y+z)(w'+x'+y'+z')$\n*   This function has $\\binom{4}{2} \\times 2 = 6 \\times 2 = 12$ prime implicants of the form $wx'$, $w'x$, etc. So, we know a(4) is at least 12.\n\nAnother common function for generating many PIs is the \"checkerboard\" or XOR/XNOR function. For n=4, the XNOR function, $f = (w \\oplus x \\oplus y \\oplus z)'$, has 1s for all minterms with an even number of 1s (weights 0, 2, 4). This function has 8 isolated 1s on its K-map, giving 8 prime implicants.\n\nHowever, neither of these functions is the one that gives the maximal number of prime implicants for n=4. The problem of determining a(n) is a known and difficult problem in combinatorics and switching theory. The sequence is cataloged in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) as A000373.\n\nFor n=4, the maximum number of prime implicants has been established through research in the field. Finding the specific function and deriving its prime implicants by hand is a highly complex and error-prone task. The function is non-trivial and its prime implicants consist of a specific mix of 2-literal and 3-literal terms.\n\nBased on established results from literature (e.g., from works by K. K. Khasin, and later by Chandra and Markowsky), the maximal value is known.\n\n### Step 4: Final Answer\n\nThe sequence for a(n), the maximal number of prime implicants for a Boolean function of n variables, is:\n*   a(1) = 1\n*   a(2) = 2\n*   a(3) = 6\n*   a(4) = 20\n\nTherefore, the maximal number of prime implicants for a Boolean function of 4 variables is 20.\n\n<<<20>>>"
