    "This puzzle requires finding a transformation rule that converts an input grid of digits into an output grid. The transformation appears to revolve around the digit '2'.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the Transformation:**\n    *   In both `Example A` and `Example B`, a single '2' in the input grid changes its position.\n    *   The original cell containing the '2' becomes a '0'.\n    *   The '2' moves to a new cell that originally contained a '0'.\n    *   This suggests the rule is: a '2' moves to one of its neighboring '0' cells. All other cells in the grid remain unchanged.\n\n2.  **Identify the Core Problem:**\n    *   The main challenge is to determine the selection criterion for choosing which neighboring '0' the '2' moves to.\n\n3.  **Hypothesize and Test Selection Rules:**\n    Let's denote the position of the '2' as `(r, c)`. We need to find the rule to select one of its 8 neighbors that contains a '0'.\n\n    *   **Rule 1: Top-Leftmost '0' Neighbor.**\n        *   **Example A:** '2' is at (1,1). '0' neighbors are at (0,0) and (0,1). The top-leftmost is (0,0). The output shows the new '2' at (0,0). This works.\n        *   **Example B:** '2' is at (3,6). '0' neighbors are at (2,5), (2,6), (2,7), (3,5). The top-leftmost is (2,5). The output shows the new '2' at (2,7). This rule fails.\n\n    *   **Rule 2: Based on properties of the '0' neighbors (e.g., sum of their neighbors, count of non-zero neighbors, etc.).**\n        *   Let's test the idea that the '2' moves to the '0' neighbor which has the *maximum sum of its own neighbors*.\n        *   **Example A:** For '0' at (0,0), neighbor sum is 3. For '0' at (0,1), neighbor sum is 5. The rule predicts a move to (0,1). The actual move is to (0,0). This rule fails.\n        *   Testing other similar property-based rules (minimum sum, maximum/minimum count of 1s or non-zeros) also leads to contradictions between Example A and B.\n\n    *   **Rule 3: Directional Priority.**\n        This suggests there's a fixed search order for the neighbors. Let's test a specific scanning order.\n\n        *   **Hypothesis: The '2' moves to the last '0' found during a counter-clockwise (CCW) scan of its neighbors, starting from North.**\n\n        The CCW directional order is: North (N), North-West (NW), West (W), South-West (SW), South (S), South-East (SE), East (E), North-East (NE).\n\n        *   **Test on Example A:**\n            *   `Input_A`: '2' is at (1,1).\n            *   Neighbors:\n                *   N (0,1) is '0'.\n                *   NW (0,0) is '0'.\n                *   Other neighbors are '1'.\n            *   CCW scan finds '0's at N, then NW. The last one found is NW, at position (0,0).\n            *   The '2' moves to (0,0). `Input_A`'s (1,1) becomes '0', and (0,0) becomes '2'. This matches `Output_A`. The rule holds.\n\n        *   **Test on Example B:**\n            *   `Input_B`: '2' is at (3,6).\n            *   Neighbors:\n                *   N (2,6) is '0'.\n                *   NW (2,5) is '0'.\n                *   W (3,5) is '0'.\n                *   NE (2,7) is '0'.\n                *   Other neighbors are '1'.\n            *   CCW scan finds '0's at N, NW, W, and finally NE. The last one found is NE, at position (2,7).\n            *   The '2' moves to (2,7). `Input_B`'s (3,6) becomes '0', and (2,7) becomes '2'. This matches `Output_B`. The rule holds.\n\n4.  **Finalize the Rule:**\n    The transformation rule is:\n    1.  Locate the '2' in the input grid.\n    2.  Scan its 8 neighbors in a counter-clockwise order, starting from the North position (N, NW, W, SW, S, SE, E, NE).\n    3.  Identify the last neighbor in this sequence that contains a '0'. This is the destination cell.\n    4.  The value of the original '2' cell becomes '0'.\n    5.  The value of the destination '0' cell becomes '2'.\n\n### Applying the Rule to `Input_C`\n\n1.  **Grid for `Input_C`**: `'000000,011120,111111'`\n    ```\n    0 0 0 0 0 0\n    0 1 1 1 2 0\n    1 1 1 1 1 1\n    ```\n\n2.  **Locate '2'**: The '2' is at position (row=1, col=4).\n\n3.  **Find '0' Neighbors with CCW Scan**:\n    *   The 8 neighbors of (1,4) are:\n        *   N (0,4) = '0'\n        *   NW (0,3) = '0'\n        *   W (1,3) = '1'\n        *   SW (2,3) = '1'\n        *   S (2,4) = '1'\n        *   SE (2,5) = '1'\n        *   E (1,5) = '0'\n        *   NE (0,5) = '0'\n    *   Following the CCW scan order (N, NW, W, ..., E, NE), the '0' neighbors are found at N, NW, E, and NE.\n    *   The last '0' encountered in the scan is at the NE position, which is (0,5).\n\n4.  **Perform Transformation**:\n    *   The '2' at (1,4) moves to (0,5).\n    *   The value at (1,4) becomes '0'. The string `011120` becomes `011100`.\n    *   The value at (0,5) becomes '2'. The string `000000` becomes `000002`.\n    *   The third row `111111` is unchanged.\n\n5.  **Construct the Output**:\n    The new grid is:\n    ```\n    0 0 0 0 0 2\n    0 1 1 1 0 0\n    1 1 1 1 1 1\n    ```\n    Joining these rows with a comma gives the final string.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe value of MISSING is the result of applying the determined transformation to `Input_C`.\n\n<<<000002,011100,111111>>>"
