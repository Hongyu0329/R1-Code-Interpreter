    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of wallpaper groups with a point group of order 2.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Core Concepts\n\n*   **Wallpaper Groups:** These are the 17 distinct groups of symmetries (isometries) of a two-dimensional repeating pattern, like a wallpaper. They are also known as plane crystallographic groups. Each group is a combination of translations, rotations, reflections, and glide reflections.\n*   **Point Group:** For any wallpaper group, the point group is the set of all rotational and reflectional symmetries when you consider them acting around a single, fixed point, ignoring the translational aspect. Formally, if `G` is a wallpaper group and `T` is its subgroup of pure translations, the point group is the quotient group `G/T`. The order of a point group is the number of distinct symmetry operations in it (e.g., identity, rotation, reflection).\n*   **The Question:** We need to find how many of the 17 wallpaper groups have a point group containing exactly two elements (i.e., order 2).\n\n### Step 2: Identify the 2D Crystallographic Point Groups and their Orders\n\nThe crystallographic restriction theorem limits the possible rotational symmetries in a crystal lattice to 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6-fold rotations. This leads to 10 possible 2D point groups. Let's list them and their orders.\n\n1.  **1** (or C₁): Contains only the identity operation. Order = 1.\n2.  **2** (or C₂): Contains identity and a 180° rotation. Order = 2.\n3.  **m** (or Cₛ): Contains identity and a single reflection. Order = 2.\n4.  **3** (or C₃): Contains identity and 120°, 240° rotations. Order = 3.\n5.  **4** (or C₄): Contains rotations of 0°, 90°, 180°, 270°. Order = 4.\n6.  **2mm** (or C₂ᵥ): Contains identity, a 180° rotation, and two perpendicular reflections. Order = 4.\n7.  **6** (or C₆): Contains rotations in multiples of 60°. Order = 6.\n8.  **3m** (or C₃ᵥ): Point group of an equilateral triangle. Order = 6.\n9.  **4mm** (or C₄ᵥ): Point group of a square. Order = 8.\n10. **6mm** (or C₆ᵥ): Point group of a regular hexagon. Order = 12.\n\nFrom this list, we can see that the only point groups with an order of 2 are **2** and **m**.\n\n### Step 3: Count the Wallpaper Groups for each Point Group of Order 2\n\nNow we must go through the 17 wallpaper groups and identify which ones have a point group of **2** or **m**. Wallpaper groups are often classified by their point group.\n\n**A. Wallpaper groups with Point Group 2:**\n*   This point group consists of the identity and a 180° rotation. The simplest lattice that has this symmetry is the oblique lattice. When 2-fold rotation centers are added to a lattice of translations, they form a specific arrangement.\n*   There is only **one** wallpaper group whose point group is **2**. It is denoted as **p2**.\n\n**B. Wallpaper groups with Point Group m:**\n*   This point group consists of the identity and a reflection. A single reflection line symmetry is incompatible with an oblique lattice and requires a rectangular lattice system (which includes rhombic as a special case).\n*   For a **primitive rectangular** lattice:\n    1.  We can have true reflection lines. This results in the group **pm**.\n    2.  We can have only glide reflections (where the linear part is a reflection, but there is an associated translation parallel to the axis). This results in the group **pg**.\n*   For a **centered rectangular** (or rhombic) lattice:\n    3.  Adding reflection lines to a centered lattice necessarily creates glide reflections as well. This single, distinct group is called **cm**.\n*   Thus, there are **three** wallpaper groups whose point group is **m**: **pm**, **pg**, and **cm**.\n\n### Step 4: Final Calculation\n\nTo get the total count, we sum the numbers of groups found for each relevant point group.\n*   Number of groups with point group **2**: 1 (the group p2)\n*   Number of groups with point group **m**: 3 (the groups pm, pg, cm)\n*   Total = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nTherefore, there are 4 wallpaper groups that have a point group of order 2.\n\n<<<4>>>"
