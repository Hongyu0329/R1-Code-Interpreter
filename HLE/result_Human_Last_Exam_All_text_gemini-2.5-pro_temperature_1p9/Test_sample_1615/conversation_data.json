    "This problem asks for the maximum chromatic number, denoted $\\chi(G)$, for a graph $G$ with 12345 vertices, given that $G$ is not a complete graph.\n\nLet $n = 12345$ be the number of vertices in the graph $G$.\nThe condition is that $G$ is not the complete graph $K_n$.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the maximum number of colors required.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the definition of chromatic number and properties of the graph G.**\n*   The chromatic number $\\chi(G)$ is the minimum number of colors needed for a proper vertex coloring of $G$. A proper coloring is an assignment of colors to vertices such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.\n*   The graph $G$ has $n = 12345$ vertices.\n*   $G$ is not a complete graph ($G \\neq K_{12345}$). A complete graph $K_n$ is a graph where every pair of distinct vertices is connected by an edge.\n\n**Step 2: Establish an upper bound for the chromatic number $\\chi(G)$.**\nLet $G$ be any graph with $n$ vertices that is not complete.\nSince $G$ is not a complete graph, there must exist at least one pair of vertices that are not connected by an edge. Let's call these two non-adjacent vertices $u$ and $v$.\n\nWe can define a coloring strategy for any such graph $G$ using at most $n-1$ colors. This will prove that $\\chi(G) \\leq n-1$.\nThe existence of the non-adjacent pair $(u, v)$ allows us to place them in the same \"color class\". In a proper coloring, all vertices in a color class form an independent set (a set of vertices where no two are adjacent).\n\nLet's construct a partition of the vertex set $V$ into $n-1$ independent sets:\n1.  Create one set $S_1 = \\{u, v\\}$. Since $u$ and $v$ are not adjacent, this is an independent set.\n2.  Let the remaining $n-2$ vertices of the graph be $w_1, w_2, \\ldots, w_{n-2}$.\n3.  Create $n-2$ more sets, each containing a single vertex: $S_2 = \\{w_1\\}$, $S_3 = \\{w_2\\}$, ..., $S_{n-1} = \\{w_{n-2}\\}$. A set with a single vertex is always an independent set.\n\nNow we have partitioned the entire vertex set $V$ into $n-1$ independent sets: $V = S_1 \\cup S_2 \\cup \\cdots \\cup S_{n-1}$.\nWe can assign a distinct color to each of these independent sets. For example, all vertices in $S_1$ get color 1, all in $S_2$ get color 2, and so on, up to color $n-1$ for the vertices in $S_{n-1}$.\nThis constitutes a proper coloring of $G$ using $n-1$ colors. To see why it's proper, consider any two adjacent vertices $x$ and $y$. They cannot both belong to the same set $S_i$, because each $S_i$ is an independent set. Therefore, they must belong to different sets, say $x \\in S_i$ and $y \\in S_j$ with $i \\neq j$. According to our coloring scheme, they will receive different colors (color $i$ and color $j$).\n\nSince we have shown that any graph $G$ with $n$ vertices that is not complete can be colored with $n-1$ colors, its chromatic number must be at most $n-1$.\nSo, $\\chi(G) \\leq n-1$.\nFor $n = 12345$, this means $\\chi(G) \\leq 12344$.\n\n**Step 3: Show that this upper bound is achievable.**\nTo show that $n-1$ is the maximum possible value, we need to find at least one graph $G$ that satisfies the conditions ($n=12345$ vertices, not complete) and has a chromatic number of exactly $n-1$.\n\nConsider a graph $G^*$ constructed as follows:\n*   Take a complete graph $K_{n-1}$ (a clique of size $n-1$). This requires $n-1 = 12344$ vertices.\n*   Add one more vertex, say $z$, to the graph, but do not add any edges connecting $z$ to any of the vertices in the $K_{n-1}$. So $z$ is an isolated vertex.\nThe resulting graph $G^*$ is the disjoint union of $K_{n-1}$ and a single vertex, which can be written as $G^* = K_{n-1} \\cup K_1$.\n\nLet's check the properties of $G^*$:\n*   **Number of vertices:** $G^*$ has $(n-1) + 1 = n = 12345$ vertices.\n*   **Completeness:** $G^*$ is not a complete graph because the vertex $z$ is not connected to any other vertex.\nSo, $G^*$ is a valid graph for our problem.\n\nNow, let's determine the chromatic number of $G^*$.\nThe subgraph $K_{n-1}$ contains a clique of size $n-1$. A clique of size $k$ requires $k$ distinct colors. Therefore, we need at least $n-1$ colors to properly color the vertices of the $K_{n-1}$ subgraph. This provides a lower bound for the chromatic number of $G^*$: $\\chi(G^*) \\geq n-1$.\n\nWe can properly color $G^*$ using exactly $n-1$ colors:\n*   Color the $n-1$ vertices of the $K_{n-1}$ subgraph with $n-1$ distinct colors.\n*   The isolated vertex $z$ is not adjacent to any other vertex, so it can be colored with any of these $n-1$ colors. For instance, we can give it the same color as one of the vertices in $K_{n-1}$.\nThis shows that $\\chi(G^*) \\leq n-1$.\n\nCombining the lower and upper bounds for $\\chi(G^*)$, we have $\\chi(G^*) = n-1 = 12344$.\n\n**Step 4: Final Conclusion.**\nWe have shown that for any graph $G$ with $n=12345$ vertices that is not complete, its chromatic number is at most $12344$.\nWe have also constructed a specific graph that meets the criteria and has a chromatic number of exactly $12344$.\nTherefore, the maximum number of colors that could be needed is $12344$.\n\nFinal Answer Calculation:\nNumber of vertices $n = 12345$.\nThe maximum required number of colors is $n-1$.\n$12345 - 1 = 12344$."
