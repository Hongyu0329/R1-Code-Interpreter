    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Interpreting the Question\n\nThe question asks for \"the partition function Z for a system with Hamiltonian $H^\\wedge=−μN^\\wedge$ in the grand canonical ensemble\". This phrasing can be interpreted in a few ways, so we must first clarify the setup.\n\n1.  **Grand Canonical Ensemble:** In this ensemble, the system can exchange energy and particles with a reservoir at constant temperature T and chemical potential $\\mu$. The partition function, denoted $Z_G$, is defined as:\n    $Z_G = \\text{Tr}[e^{-\\beta(H - \\mu N)}]$\n    where $\\beta = 1/(k_B T)$, $H$ is the system's intrinsic Hamiltonian (describing kinetic and potential energies), and $N$ is the particle number operator.\n\n2.  **System's Hamiltonian:** The problem states that the system's Hamiltonian is $H^\\wedge = -\\mu N^\\wedge$. The most reasonable physical interpretation of this statement is that the intrinsic Hamiltonian $H$ is zero. That is, the particles are non-interacting and have no kinetic energy (or all single-particle energy states are degenerate at zero energy). So, we set $H=0$.\n\n3.  **The Calculation:** Based on this interpretation, the quantity we need to calculate is the grand canonical partition function with $H=0$:\n    $Z_G = \\text{Tr}[e^{-\\beta(0 - \\mu N)}] = \\text{Tr}[e^{\\beta\\mu N}]$\n\n### Step 2: Evaluation using the Fock Space Trace\n\nThe trace ($\\text{Tr}$) is a sum over a complete set of basis states for the system. In the grand canonical ensemble, the trace is over the entire Fock space, which includes states with any number of particles. We use the basis of occupation number states, $| \\{n_k\\} \\rangle = |n_1, n_2, \\dots \\rangle$, where $n_k$ is the number of particles in the single-particle state $k$.\n\n1.  **Operator Action:** The particle number operator $N$ is the sum of the number operators for each single-particle state, $N = \\sum_k N_k$. This operator is diagonal in the Fock basis:\n    $N |\\{n_k\\}\\rangle = (\\sum_k n_k) |\\{n_k\\}\\rangle$\n\n2.  **Evaluating the Trace:** We can now write the trace explicitly as a sum over all possible occupation number configurations $\\{n_k\\}$:\n    $Z_G = \\sum_{\\{n_k\\}} \\langle \\{n_k\\} | e^{\\beta\\mu N} | \\{n_k\\} \\rangle = \\sum_{\\{n_k\\}} e^{\\beta\\mu (\\sum_k n_k)}$\n\n3.  **Separating the Sum:** The exponential of a sum can be written as a product of exponentials. We can also interchange the sum over configurations with the product over states:\n    $Z_G = \\sum_{\\{n_k\\}} \\prod_k e^{\\beta\\mu n_k} = \\prod_k \\left( \\sum_{n_k} (e^{\\beta\\mu})^{n_k} \\right)$\n    This simplifies the problem: we just need to calculate the sum for a single state (the term in the parenthesis) and then take the product over all available single-particle states. The allowed values for the occupation number $n_k$ depend on whether the particles are bosons or fermions.\n\n### Step 3: Considering Particle Statistics\n\nThe question does not specify the particle type, so we must consider both cases. Let $M$ be the total number of available single-particle states.\n\n#### Case A: The particles are Bosons\nFor bosons, any number of particles can occupy a given state, so $n_k \\in \\{0, 1, 2, \\dots\\}$. The sum for a single state is an infinite geometric series:\n$\\sum_{n_k=0}^{\\infty} (e^{\\beta\\mu})^{n_k} = 1 + e^{\\beta\\mu} + e^{2\\beta\\mu} + \\dots$\nThis series converges to $\\frac{1}{1 - e^{\\beta\\mu}}$ provided that the common ratio is less than 1, i.e., $|e^{\\beta\\mu}| < 1$. Since $\\beta=1/(k_BT) > 0$, this requires $e^{\\beta\\mu}<1$, which implies the chemical potential must be negative ($\\mu < 0$).\n\nThe total partition function is the product over all $M$ states:\n$Z_{G, \\text{Bosons}} = \\prod_{k=1}^{M} \\left( \\frac{1}{1 - e^{\\beta\\mu}} \\right) = \\left( \\frac{1}{1 - e^{\\beta\\mu}} \\right)^M$\n\n#### Case B: The particles are Fermions\nFor fermions, the Pauli exclusion principle dictates that a single state can be occupied by at most one particle, so $n_k \\in \\{0, 1\\}$. The sum becomes a simple two-term expression:\n$\\sum_{n_k=0}^{1} (e^{\\beta\\mu})^{n_k} = (e^{\\beta\\mu})^0 + (e^{\\beta\\mu})^1 = 1 + e^{\\beta\\mu}$\n\nThe total partition function is the product over all $M$ states:\n$Z_{G, \\text{Fermions}} = \\prod_{k=1}^{M} \\left( 1 + e^{\\beta\\mu} \\right) = (1 + e^{\\beta\\mu})^M$\n\n### Step 4: Connection to the Path Integral Formalism\n\nThe question specifically asks to use path integrals. The path integral formulation of the grand canonical partition function is:\n$Z_G = \\int \\mathcal{D}[\\psi^*, \\psi] e^{-S[\\psi^*, \\psi]}$\nwhere the action for this problem (with $H=0$, so single-particle energies $\\epsilon_k=0$) is:\n$S = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\sum_k \\psi_k^*(\\tau) (\\partial_\\tau - \\mu) \\psi_k(\\tau)$\n\nThis path integral is a Gaussian integral over the fields $\\psi_k$ and can be formally evaluated. The result is given by the functional determinant of the operator in the action:\n$Z_G = \\left(\\text{det}[\\partial_\\tau - \\mu]\\right)^{-s}$\nwhere the product is taken over all $M$ states, and $s=1$ for bosons (commuting fields) and $s=-1$ for fermions (anti-commuting Grassmann fields).\nEvaluating this functional determinant involves summing over the eigenvalues (Matsubara frequencies) of the $\\partial_\\tau$ operator, which leads to infinite sums/products. After proper regularization, this formal procedure correctly reproduces the results derived above using the operator method. The operator method is more direct for this particular problem.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe final answer depends on the statistics of the particles. Let $M$ be the total number of single-particle states.\n\n**For a system of Bosons:**\nThe partition function is\n$Z_G = \\left( \\frac{1}{1 - e^{\\beta\\mu}} \\right)^M$\nThis result is valid under the condition that the chemical potential $\\mu < 0$.\n\n**For a system of Fermions:**\nThe partition function is\n$Z_G = (1 + e^{\\beta\\mu})^M$\n\nSince the question is general, the full answer should include both possibilities.\n\n<<<\nThe partition function depends on the statistics of the particles. Let M be the total number of available single-particle states.\n\nFor a system of **Bosons**, the partition function is:\n$Z = \\left( \\frac{1}{1 - e^{\\beta\\mu}} \\right)^M$, where a necessary condition for convergence is $\\mu < 0$.\n\nFor a system of **Fermions**, the partition function is:\n$Z = (1 + e^{\\beta\\mu})^M$\n>>>"
