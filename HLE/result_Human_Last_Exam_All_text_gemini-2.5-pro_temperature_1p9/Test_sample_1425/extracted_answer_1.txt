The partition function depends on the statistics of the particles. Let M be the total number of available single-particle states.

For a system of **Bosons**, the partition function is:
$Z = \left( \frac{1}{1 - e^{\beta\mu}} \right)^M$, where a necessary condition for convergence is $\mu < 0$.

For a system of **Fermions**, the partition function is:
$Z = (1 + e^{\beta\mu})^M$
