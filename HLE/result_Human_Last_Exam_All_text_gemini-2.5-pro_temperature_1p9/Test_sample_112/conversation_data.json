    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Question:** The question asks to identify a specific \"book of manners\" that was preserved in the same source as the Middle English romance poem, \"Sir Launfal.\"\n\n2.  **Understand \"Preserved Alongside\":** In the context of medieval literature, texts were \"preserved\" by being copied by scribes into manuscripts. Often, a single manuscript would contain several different works bound together. This collection of texts in one volume is called a miscellany. Therefore, the question is asking what book of manners is found in the same manuscript as \"Sir Launfal.\"\n\n3.  **Identify the Manuscript:** The poem \"Sir Launfal,\" written by Thomas Chestre in the late 14th century, survives in only one manuscript. This manuscript is designated as **Cotton Caligula A.ii**. It is part of the famous Cotton collection, now held in the British Library.\n\n4.  **Examine the Contents of the Manuscript:** The Cotton Caligula A.ii manuscript is a miscellany containing a variety of texts, primarily Middle English romances and historical chronicles. To answer the question, we need to look at a list of its contents and find the one that fits the description of a \"book of manners.\"\n\n5.  **Identify the Book of Manners:** When we examine the contents of Cotton Caligula A.ii, we find the following major works:\n    *   *La Estorie del anceleis* (a historical work)\n    *   *The Chronicle of Peter Langtoft* (a historical work)\n    *   Several Middle English Romances, including *Sir Launfal*, *Lybeaus Desconus*, *Emar√©*, and *The southern Octavian*.\n    *   A text titled **\"The Boke of Curtasye\"** (which translates to *The Book of Courtesy*).\n\n6.  **Confirm the Identification:** A \"book of courtesy\" is a genre of medieval literature that provided instructions on etiquette, good behavior, and proper conduct, especially for pages, squires, or others serving in a noble household. This precisely matches the description of a \"book of manners.\"\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Manuscript Specificity:** It's crucial to know that the poem exists in a single, specific manuscript. The answer depends entirely on the other contents of that particular volume.\n*   **Genre Identification:** One must correctly identify \"The Boke of Curtasye\" as a book of manners or a conduct book.\n*   **Spelling:** Medieval spellings can vary. \"Curtasye\" is the Middle English spelling for \"Courtesy.\"\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBy tracing the preservation of \"Sir Launfal\" to the manuscript Cotton Caligula A.ii and then examining the other texts within that same manuscript, we can identify the book of manners preserved alongside it. That book is \"The Boke of Curtasye.\"\n\n<<<The Boke of Curtasye (The Book of Courtesy)>>>"
