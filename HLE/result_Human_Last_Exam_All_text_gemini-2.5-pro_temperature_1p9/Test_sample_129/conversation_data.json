    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of true boolean expressions of length 5.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Goal and Constraints\nThe objective is to find the number of unique, syntactically valid boolean expression **strings** of exactly 5 symbols that evaluate to **True**.\n- **Allowed Symbols:** `T`, `F`, `!`, `&`, `|`, `(`, `)`\n- **Expression Length:** Exactly 5 symbols.\n- **Symbol Repetition:** Allowed.\n- **Operator Precedence:** `!` (highest), then `&`, then `|` (lowest).\n- **Evaluation:** We are counting expressions that result in `True`.\n\nA key point is that we are counting distinct strings. For example, `(T)` is a 3-symbol string, while `T` is a 1-symbol string, even though they evaluate to the same value.\n\n### Step 2: Method - Enumerate Valid Skeletons\nThe most systematic approach is to identify all possible valid structures (skeletons) of a 5-symbol expression string, and then for each skeleton, count how many ways it can be instantiated with `T` and `F` to evaluate to `True`.\n\nLet `V` represent an operand (`T` or `F`), `B` represent a binary operator (`&` or `|`), `U` represent the unary operator (`!`), `L` represent `(`, and `R` represent `)`.\n\nWe will list all valid 5-symbol skeletons and analyze them.\n\n### Step 3: Analysis of Expression Skeletons\n\n#### Skeletons without Parentheses (L=0, R=0)\nA valid expression without parentheses and with binary operators must have one more operand than operators.\n1.  **`V B V B V`** (e.g., `T&F|T`)\n    -   This skeleton has 3 operands and 2 binary operators. `2^3=8` ways to choose operands, `2^2=4` ways to choose operators.\n    -   **`o1 & o2 & o3`**: True only for `T&T&T`. (1)\n    -   **`o1 | o2 | o3`**: True unless all are `F`. `2^3 - 1 = 7` ways.\n    -   **`(o1 & o2) | o3`**: True if `o3=T` (4 ways) or if `o1=T, o2=T, o3=F` (1 way). `4+1=5` ways.\n    -   **`o1 | (o2 & o3)`**: True if `o1=T` (4 ways) or if `o1=F, o2=T, o3=T` (1 way). `4+1=5` ways.\n    -   Total: `1 + 7 + 5 + 5 = 18`\n\n2.  **`U V B U V`** (e.g., `!T & !F`, parsed as `(!T)&(!F)`)\n    -   `!o1 & !o2`: True only for `!F&!F`. (1)\n    -   `!o1 | !o2`: True unless both operands are false. True for `!T|!F`, `!F|!T`, `!F|!F`. (3)\n    -   Total: `1 + 3 = 4`\n\n3.  **`U U V B V`** (e.g., `!!T & F`, parsed as `(!!T)&F`)\n    -   `!!o1 & o2`: True only for `!!T&T`. (1)\n    -   `!!o1 | o2`: True for `!!T|T`, `!!T|F`, `!!F|T`. (3)\n    -   Total: `1 + 3 = 4`\n\n4.  **`V B U U V`** (e.g., `T & !!F`, parsed as `T&(!!F)`)\n    -   Symmetrical to the previous case.\n    -   Total: `4`\n\n5.  **`U U U U V`** (e.g., `!!!!T`)\n    -   `!!!!o1`: `!!!!T` is True, `!!!!F` is False.\n    -   Total: `1`\n\n#### Skeletons with Parentheses\nThe parentheses `L...R` must enclose a valid sub-expression.\n\n6.  **`L V B V R`** (e.g., `(T&F)`)\n    -   `(o1 & o2)`: True only for `(T&T)`. (1)\n    -   `(o1 | o2)`: True for `(T|T)`, `(T|F)`, `(F|T)`. (3)\n    -   Total: `1 + 3 = 4`\n\n7.  **`L L V R R`** (e.g., `((T))`)\n    -   `((o1))`: True for `((T))`.\n    -   Total: `1`\n\n8.  **`L U U V R`** (e.g., `(!!T)`)\n    -   `(!!o1)`: True for `(!!T)`.\n    -   Total: `1`\n\n9.  **`L V R B V`** (e.g., `(T)&F`)\n    -   This is parsed as `(o1) B o2`, which is equivalent in value to `o1 B o2`.\n    -   `(o1) & o2`: True for `(T)&T`. (1)\n    -   `(o1) | o2`: True for `(T)|T`, `(T)|F`, `(F)|T`. (3)\n    -   Total: `1 + 3 = 4`\n\n10. **`V B L V R`** (e.g., `T&(F)`)\n    -   Symmetrical to the previous case.\n    -   Total: `4`\n\n11. **`U L U V R`** (e.g., `!(!T)`)\n    -   `!(!o1)`: The sub-expression `(!o1)` evaluates to `False` for `o1=T` and `True` for `o1=F`.\n    -   `!(!T)` evaluates to `!(F)` which is `True`.\n    -   `!(!F)` evaluates to `!(T)` which is `False`.\n    -   Total: `1`\n\n### Step 4: Final Summation\nNow we sum the counts from all the valid skeletons we identified.\n1.  `VBVBV`: 18\n2.  `UVBUV`: 4\n3.  `UUVBV`: 4\n4.  `VBUUV`: 4\n5.  `UUUUV`: 1\n6.  `(VBV)`: 4\n7.  `((V))`: 1\n8.  `(!!V)`: 1\n9.  `(V)BV`: 4\n10. `VB(V)`: 4\n11. `!(!V)`: 1\n\nTotal Count = `18 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1`\nTotal Count = `18 + (4 * 4) + (1 * 3) + 4 + 4 + 1`\nTotal Count = `18 + 16 + 3 + 8 + 1`\nTotal Count = `34 + 3 + 8 + 1`\nTotal Count = `37 + 8 + 1`\nTotal Count = `45 + 1`\nTotal Count = `46`\n\nThere are 46 such true boolean expressions.\n\n<<<46>>>"
