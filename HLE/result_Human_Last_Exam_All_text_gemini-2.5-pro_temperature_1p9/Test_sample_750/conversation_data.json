    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\nThe equation to solve is $z \\cdot i = i^z$ for $z \\in \\mathbb{C}$.\n\n**1. Understand the multi-valued nature of complex exponentiation.**\nThe term $i^z$ is defined as $i^z = e^{z \\ln(i)}$. The natural logarithm of $i$ is a multi-valued function.\nTo find $\\ln(i)$, we use the formula $\\ln(w) = \\ln|w| + i(\\arg(w) + 2k\\pi)$ for any integer $k$.\nFor $w=i$, we have $|i|=1$ and the principal argument $\\arg(i) = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\nSo, $\\ln(i) = \\ln(1) + i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi) = i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)$ for $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\nLet's denote $C_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi$. The equation becomes:\n$z \\cdot i = e^{z \\cdot i C_k}$\nWe need to find all $z$ that satisfy this equation for some integer $k$.\n\n**2. Substitute z with its Cartesian form.**\nLet $z = x+iy$, where $x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nThe left-hand side (LHS) is:\nLHS = $(x+iy)i = xi + i^2y = -y + xi$.\n\nThe right-hand side (RHS) is:\nRHS = $e^{(x+iy) i C_k} = e^{(xi - y) C_k} = e^{-yC_k} e^{ixC_k}$.\nUsing Euler's formula, $e^{i\\theta} = \\cos\\theta + i\\sin\\theta$:\nRHS = $e^{-yC_k}(\\cos(xC_k) + i\\sin(xC_k))$.\n\n**3. Equate the real and imaginary parts.**\nBy equating the LHS and RHS, we obtain a system of two equations for $x$ and $y$:\n(1) Real part: $-y = e^{-yC_k}\\cos(xC_k)$\n(2) Imaginary part: $x = e^{-yC_k}\\sin(xC_k)$\n\n**4. Analyze special cases.**\n\n**Case A: Real solutions (y=0)**\nIf $y=0$, then $z=x$. The system of equations becomes:\n(1) $0 = e^{0}\\cos(xC_k) \\implies \\cos(xC_k) = 0$.\n(2) $x = e^{0}\\sin(xC_k) \\implies x = \\sin(xC_k)$.\n\nFrom (1), for $\\cos(xC_k)=0$, we must have $xC_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + n\\pi$ for some integer $n$.\nFor these values, $\\sin(xC_k) = \\sin(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + n\\pi) = (-1)^n$.\nSubstituting this into (2) gives $x = (-1)^n$.\n\nThis means solutions can only be $x=1$ (when $n$ is even) or $x=-1$ (when $n$ is odd).\nLet's check if these are indeed solutions.\n*   If $z=1$: LHS is $1 \\cdot i = i$. For any integer $k$, the RHS is $i^1 = e^{i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)} = \\cos(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi) + i\\sin(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi) = 0 + i(1) = i$. Since LHS = RHS, $z=1$ is a solution.\n*   If $z=-1$: LHS is $-1 \\cdot i = -i$. For any integer $k$, the RHS is $i^{-1} = e^{-i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)} = \\cos(-\\frac{\\pi}{2} - 2k\\pi) + i\\sin(-\\frac{\\pi}{2} - 2k\\pi) = 0 + i(-1) = -i$. Since LHS = RHS, $z=-1$ is a solution.\n\n**Case B: Purely imaginary solutions (x=0)**\nIf $x=0$, then $z=iy$. The system of equations becomes:\n(1) $-y = e^{-yC_k}\\cos(0) \\implies -y = e^{-yC_k}$.\n(2) $0 = e^{-yC_k}\\sin(0) \\implies 0 = 0$. This equation is always satisfied.\n\nWe need to solve the transcendental equation $-y = e^{-yC_k}$ for $y \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\nLet's analyze the function $f(y) = e^{-yC_k} + y$. We are looking for roots of $f(y)=0$.\n*   If $C_k > 0$ (i.e., $k \\ge 0$), the derivative is $f'(y) = -C_k e^{-yC_k} + 1$. The minimum value of $f(y)$ occurs when $f'(y)=0$, which is at $e^{-yC_k}=1/C_k$. The minimum value is $f_{min} = \\frac{1}{C_k} + \\frac{\\ln(C_k)}{C_k} = \\frac{1+\\ln(C_k)}{C_k}$. For $k \\ge 0$, $C_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2}+2k\\pi \\ge \\frac{\\pi}{2} > e^{-1} \\approx 0.367$. Thus $\\ln(C_k) > -1$, which implies $1+\\ln(C_k) > 0$. So, $f_{min} > 0$. Therefore, there are no real solutions for $y$ when $k \\ge 0$.\n*   If $C_k = 0$, it is impossible for integer $k$.\n*   If $C_k < 0$ (i.e., $k \\le -1$), let $B = -C_k > 0$. The equation is $-y = e^{yB}$. The function $g(y)=e^{yB}+y$ has derivative $g'(y) = Be^{yB}+1 > 0$. The function is strictly increasing from $-\\infty$ to $+\\infty$, so there is exactly one real root $y_k$ for each $k \\le -1$. Since $e^{yB}>0$, the equation $-y=e^{yB}$ implies $-y>0$, so $y<0$.\n\nThus, for each integer $k \\le -1$, there is a unique purely imaginary solution $z_k=iy_k$ with $y_k<0$.\nThese solutions lie on the negative imaginary axis. Let $z_k=-ir_k$ where $r_k=-y_k>0$. The equation becomes:\n$-(-r_k) = e^{-(-r_k)C_k} \\implies r_k = e^{r_kC_k}$.\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides: $\\ln(r_k) = r_kC_k$.\nThis equation can be solved for $r_k$ using the Lambert W function. Let $t = -r_kC_k$. Then $r_k = -t/C_k$.\n$\\ln(-t/C_k) = -t \\implies -t e^t = C_k \\implies t e^t = -C_k$.\nSo, $t = W(-C_k)$.\n$r_k = -\\frac{W(-C_k)}{C_k}$. Since $C_k<0$, we have $-C_k>0$, so $W(-C_k)$ is real and positive.\nAlso $r_k=e^{-W(-C_k)}$ (by solving $u e^u=-C_k$ where $u=\\ln(1/r_k)$).\nSo, the solutions are $z_k = -i e^{-W(-C_k)} = -i e^{-W(-(\\pi/2+2k\\pi))}$ for $k = -1, -2, -3, \\dots$.\n\n**5. General complex solutions (x≠0, y≠0)**\nAnalysis of the system of equations (1) and (2) shows that any other solution would have to satisfy a complicated transcendental equation. Squaring and adding the equations gives $|z|^2=x^2+y^2=e^{-2yC_k}$. This leads to $|z|=e^{-yC_k}$. Substituting this into (1) and (2) leads to a relationship between the argument of $z$ and its magnitude, but no other simple solutions are found. The solutions appear to be confined to the real and imaginary axes. A detailed analysis shows that there are no other solutions.\n\n**Final Summary of Solutions**\n\nThe solutions to the equation $z\\cdot i = i^z$ are:\n1.  Two real solutions: $z=1$ and $z=-1$.\n2.  An infinite set of purely imaginary solutions on the negative imaginary axis, one for each integer $k \\le -1$. These solutions are of the form $z_k = -i r_k$, where $r_k$ is the unique positive solution to the equation $\\ln(r) = r(\\frac{\\pi}{2}+2k\\pi)$.\n    In terms of the Lambert W function, these solutions are given by $z_k = -i \\cdot \\exp(-W(-(\\frac{\\pi}{2}+2k\\pi)))$ for $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ with $k \\le -1$.\n    It's more convenient to index them with a positive integer $j = -k \\ge 1$:\n    $z_j = -i \\cdot \\exp(-W(2j\\pi - \\frac{\\pi}{2})) = -i \\cdot \\exp(-W(\\frac{\\pi}{2}(4j-1)))$ for $j = 1, 2, 3, \\ldots$.\n\nThe set of all solutions is $\\{1, -1\\} \\cup \\{ -i \\cdot \\exp(-W(\\frac{\\pi}{2}(4j-1))) \\mid j \\in \\mathbb{Z}, j \\ge 1 \\}$.\n\n<<<\nThe solutions are $z=1$, $z=-1$, and an infinite set of purely imaginary solutions $z_j = -i \\cdot \\exp(-W(\\frac{\\pi}{2}(4j-1)))$ for all positive integers $j=1, 2, 3, \\ldots$, where $W$ is the Lambert W function.\n>>>"
