    "### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Question\n\n1.  **\"Which physicist...\"**: The request is to identify a specific person, a physicist.\n2.  **\"...better known for work in the microscopy field...\"**: This is a major clue. The person's primary fame comes from their contributions to microscopy, even if the initial discovery happened in a different context. This points towards someone who significantly advanced the way we use microscopes.\n3.  **\"...discovered an optical effect in real imagery...\"**: The discovery is a specific physical phenomenon related to optics and the formation of images that are \"real\" (meaning they can be projected onto a surface).\n4.  **\"...after it was accidentally observed...\"**: This indicates a serendipitous discovery, not one that was planned or predicted by theory beforehand.\n5.  **\"...by a custodial worker cleaning concave mirrors?\"**: This is the most specific and unique part of the story. The initial observation was made by a non-scientist, and the specific equipment involved was a concave mirror.\n\n### Listing Careful Points\n\n*   The physicist's main area of recognition must be microscopy. This rules out general-purpose physicists like Newton or Huygens, even though they made contributions to optics.\n*   The effect itself relates to making invisible features visible. A concave mirror forms a real image, and the story implies that something normally unseen on the mirror's surface (like fine scratches or dust) was made visible through a particular optical setup.\n*   The anecdote about the custodial worker is key; it is a well-known story in the history of science that directly links to a specific discovery and person.\n*   The connection between the concave mirror observation and microscopy must be clear. The physicist had to make the intellectual leap from the macro-scale observation on a mirror to its micro-scale application in a microscope.\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer\n\n1.  **Identify Potential Candidates**: We need a physicist famous for microscopy. Names that come to mind include Ernst Abbe (diffraction limit), Georges Nomarski (DIC microscopy), and Frits Zernike (phase-contrast microscopy).\n\n2.  **Evaluate the Anecdote**: Let's search for the story involving a custodial worker, a concave mirror, and an optical discovery. This story is famously associated with the Dutch physicist **Frits Zernike**.\n\n3.  **Connect the Story to the Discovery**: Zernike was investigating imperfections in diffraction gratings using a telescope setup that included a concave mirror. A janitor cleaning the lab remarked that they could see all the tiny scratches on the mirror. Zernike realized that the specific optical arrangement was making these imperfections (which are essentially transparent objects that only shift the phase of reflected light, not its amplitude) visible as bright and dark features.\n\n4.  **Connect the Discovery to Microscopy**: Zernike made the crucial connection that this same principle could be applied to microscopy. Living biological cells are mostly transparent; they don't absorb much light but do shift the phase of the light that passes through them. By developing a system to convert these invisible phase shifts into visible changes in brightness (amplitude), he invented the phase-contrast microscope.\n\n5.  **Verify the Credentials**:\n    *   **Physicist?**: Yes, Frits Zernike was a physicist.\n    *   **Better known for microscopy?**: Yes, he won the 1953 Nobel Prize in Physics specifically \"for his demonstration of the phase-contrast method, especially for his phase-contrast microscope.\" This is his most celebrated work.\n    *   **Conclusion**: All the conditions of the question are met. Frits Zernike is the physicist who applied an observation related to concave mirrors, first noted by a custodial worker, to invent the revolutionary phase-contrast microscope.\n\n<<<Frits Zernike>>>"
