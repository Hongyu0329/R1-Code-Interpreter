    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the specific artwork and its context.**\nThe question refers to a self-portrait painted by Curt Querner in 1933. The crucial piece of context is that it was created *after* he had been arrested and interrogated by the Nazi SA (who were performing the functions of the Gestapo at that early stage of the regime) due to his membership in the Communist Party and the Association of Revolutionary Visual Artists (ASSO). This context is key to understanding the symbolism in the painting. The specific painting is titled \"Selbstbildnis mit Mohnblume\" or \"Self-Portrait with Poppy Flower\".\n\n**Step 2: Observe the details of the painting.**\nIn this self-portrait, Curt Querner depicts himself with a stern, tired, yet unbroken and defiant expression. He is holding a single, vibrant red flower in his right hand, which he holds up prominently.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the object being held.**\nThe object Querner holds in his hand is a **red poppy flower**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the symbolism of the object in this specific context.**\nTo understand why this is a symbol of resistance, we need to consider the following careful points:\n*   **The Color Red:** The most important symbolic element is the color of the poppy. Red was the international color of the labor movement, socialism, and communism. By holding a bright red flower, Querner was making a clear and dangerous political statement.\n*   **A Political Statement:** The Nazis were actively and brutally suppressing communists and all left-wing political opposition in 1933. By painting himself with a symbol of his political convictions immediately after being released from custody, Querner was demonstrating that his spirit was not broken.\n*   **An Act of Defiance:** It was an act of quiet but powerful defiance. He was not holding a weapon, but a symbol of his ideology. It declared his continued allegiance to the cause for which he had just been persecuted. The flower represents his unbroken will and political identity in the face of totalitarian threat.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBy combining the historical context of his arrest with the strong political connotations of the color red, the red poppy in Curt Querner's 1933 self-portrait is unequivocally a symbol of his continued resistance and allegiance to his communist beliefs.\n\n<<<A red poppy flower>>>"
