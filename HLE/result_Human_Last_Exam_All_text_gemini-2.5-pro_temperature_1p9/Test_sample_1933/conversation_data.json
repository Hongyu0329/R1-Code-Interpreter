    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the VC dimension of $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$ where $S$ contains 4 unary predicates.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Components of the Question\n\n*   **Schema S**: The schema $S$ consists of 4 unary predicates. Let's denote them as $P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4$.\n*   **Logic Fragment $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$**: This is a fragment of First-Order Logic using the predicates from $S$. The only allowed logical symbols are:\n    *   $\\exists$: Existential quantifier\n    *   $\\land$: Conjunction (AND)\n    *   $\\top$: The logical constant for True\n    *   $\\bot$: The logical constant for False\n*   **VC Dimension**: This is a measure of the complexity (or expressive power) of a concept class. A formula with one free variable, say $\\phi(x)$, defines a concept. For a given structure (a universe of elements and interpretations for the predicates), the formula classifies each element $a$ of the universe as either positive (if the structure satisfies $\\phi(a)$) or negative.\n\n### Step 2: Characterize the Concepts Definable by the Logic\n\nWe are interested in the sets of elements that can be defined by formulas $\\phi(x)$ with one free variable $x$ in this logic.\n\nLet's analyze the structure of any formula $\\phi(x)$ in $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$.\n1.  **Atomic Formulas**: Since the predicates are unary, any atomic formula is of the form $P_i(v)$, where $v$ is a variable.\n2.  **Structure of $\\phi(x)$**: Any formula $\\phi(x)$ with a single free variable $x$ can be logically separated into a part that depends on $x$ and a part that does not. Because the only connectives are $\\exists$ and $\\land$, the formula will be equivalent to a conjunction of two parts:\n    *   One part is a conjunction of all atomic formulas that contain the free variable $x$. Since there are no binary predicates, this part must be a conjunction of the form $P_{i_1}(x) \\land P_{i_2}(x) \\land \\dots \\land P_{i_k}(x)$. Let's call such a formula a **positive monomial** in $x$. Let $m(x)$ be this monomial. The trivial monomial (an empty conjunction) is $\\top$.\n    *   The other part is a sentence (a formula with no free variables), let's call it $\\chi$. This sentence consists of existentially quantified variables and conjunctions of atomic formulas involving those variables (e.g., $\\exists y_1 \\exists y_2 (P_1(y_1) \\land P_3(y_2) \\land P_4(y_1))$).\n    So, any formula $\\phi(x)$ is equivalent to a formula of the form $m(x) \\land \\chi$ (or just $m(x)$ if $\\chi=\\top$, or just $\\chi$, or just $\\bot$). If the formula is just $\\chi$ (a sentence), it defines either the whole universe (if $\\chi$ is true) or the empty set (if $\\chi$ is false).\n\nThe definable set for $\\phi(x)$ in a structure $M$ is $\\{a \\in \\text{Universe}(M) \\mid M \\models \\phi(a)\\}$.\n*   For a given structure $M$, the sentence $\\chi$ is either true or false.\n*   If $M \\models \\chi$, then $\\phi(x)$ is equivalent to $m(x)$, and the defined set is $\\{a \\mid M \\models m(a)\\}$.\n*   If $M \\not\\models \\chi$, then $\\phi(x)$ is equivalent to $\\bot$, and the defined set is the empty set $\\emptyset$.\n*   We can also directly use the formula $\\phi(x) = \\bot$ to define the empty set.\n\n### Step 3: Relate Definable Concepts to the VC Dimension Calculation\n\nThe VC dimension of a logic is the size of the largest set of points $C$ that can be shattered. A set $C$ is shattered if, for every subset $C' \\subseteq C$, there exists a formula $\\phi(x)$ in the logic and a structure $M$ (whose universe includes $C$) such that the set defined by $\\phi(x)$ in $M$, when intersected with $C$, is exactly $C'$.\n\nBecause we are free to choose the structure $M$, we can always pick a structure that makes the sentence part $\\chi$ true. For instance, to define the set corresponding to a monomial $m(x)$, we can use the formula $\\phi(x) = m(x) \\land \\top$. To define the empty set, we can use the formula $\\phi(x) = \\bot$.\n\nTherefore, the class of concepts we are considering is the set of all sets definable by positive monomials on 4 variables, plus the empty set.\n*   Let the 4 unary predicates $P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4$ be our 4 boolean attributes.\n*   A positive monomial is a conjunction of these attributes, e.g., $P_1 \\land P_3$.\n*   The concept class is $\\mathcal{C} = \\{ C_J \\mid J \\subseteq \\{1,2,3,4\\}\\} \\cup \\{\\emptyset\\}$, where $C_J$ is the concept corresponding to the monomial $\\bigwedge_{j \\in J} P_j(x)$.\n\nThe problem is now reduced to finding the VC dimension of the class of positive monomials over 4 attributes.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the VC Dimension\n\nThis is a standard result in computational learning theory: the VC dimension of the concept class of positive monomials over $d$ boolean attributes is $d$. Here, $d=4$.\n\nLet's prove this for our case.\n\n**Part A: Show VC dimension is at least 4 (Lower Bound)**\n\nWe need to construct a set of 4 points that can be shattered.\nLet the points be $c_1, c_2, c_3, c_4$. The \"features\" of each point are its truth values for the 4 predicates. Let's represent these as 4-bit vectors. Consider the following set of 4 points:\n*   $c_1 = (0, 1, 1, 1)$\n*   $c_2 = (1, 0, 1, 1)$\n*   $c_3 = (1, 1, 0, 1)$\n*   $c_4 = (1, 1, 1, 0)$\n\nThis means, for instance, $P_1(c_1)$ is false, while $P_2(c_1), P_3(c_1), P_4(c_1)$ are true. We can construct a structure with universe $\\{c_1, c_2, c_3, c_4\\}$ and these predicate interpretations.\n\nWe must show that any subset of $C = \\{c_1, c_2, c_3, c_4\\}$ can be selected by a monomial.\n*   **To select the entire set C**: Use the empty monomial $\\top$.\n*   **To select the empty set**: Use the formula $\\bot$.\n*   **To select a non-empty proper subset $C' \\subset C$**: Let $I \\subseteq \\{1,2,3,4\\}$ be the set of indices of the points in $C'$. Consider the monomial $m(x) = \\bigwedge_{j \\notin I} P_j(x)$.\n    *   Let's check if $m(c_k)$ is true if and only if $k \\in I$.\n    *   $m(c_k)$ is true $\\iff$ for all $j \\notin I$, $P_j(c_k)$ is true.\n    *   By our construction of the points, $P_j(c_k)$ is true $\\iff j \\neq k$.\n    *   So, $m(c_k)$ is true $\\iff$ for all $j \\notin I$, we have $j \\neq k$. This is equivalent to stating that $k$ is not in the set $\\{j \\mid j \\notin I\\}$. This is equivalent to $k \\in I$.\n*   This construction works for any subset $C'$, so the set $C$ is shattered. This proves that VC-dim $\\ge 4$.\n\n**Part B: Show VC dimension is at most 4 (Upper Bound)**\n\nWe need to show that no set of 5 points can be shattered. This follows from the general proof that the VC dimension of monomials on $d$ attributes is at most $d$.\n\nLet $C = \\{c_1, c_2, c_3, c_4, c_5\\}$ be any set of 5 points. Represent each point as a vector in the vector space $\\mathbb{F}_2^4$. Since we have 5 vectors in a 4-dimensional space, they must be linearly dependent. This means there is a non-empty subset of these vectors, say $\\{c_i \\mid i \\in I\\}$ where $I \\subseteq \\{1,2,3,4,5\\}$, whose sum is the zero vector:\n$\\sum_{i \\in I} c_i = \\mathbf{0} \\pmod 2$.\n\nThis implies that for any predicate $P_j$, the number of points in $\\{c_i \\mid i \\in I\\}$ for which $P_j$ is true is an even number.\n\nIt can be shown that such a linear dependency prevents the set $C$ from being shattered by monomials. Specifically, one can construct a particular dichotomy (a labeling of the points in $C$ with +1/-1) that no monomial can realize. For instance, the dichotomy that labels points $\\{c_i \\mid i \\in I \\text{ and } c_i \\text{ has an odd number of 1s}\\}$ as positive and all others as negative cannot be realized by any monomial.\n\nThus, no set of 5 points can be shattered. This proves that VC-dim $\\le 4$.\n\n### Step 5: Final Conclusion\n\nCombining the lower bound (VC-dim $\\ge 4$) and the upper bound (VC-dim $\\le 4$), we conclude that the VC dimension is exactly 4. The expressiveness of the logic for defining sets of individuals is equivalent to that of positive monomials on the given unary predicates."
