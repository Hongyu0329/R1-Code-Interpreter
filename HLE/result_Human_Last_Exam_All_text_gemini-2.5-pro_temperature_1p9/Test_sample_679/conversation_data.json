    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the IUPAC name of the compound.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Molecular Formula**\nThe molecular formula is $C_7H_{14}$.\nTo determine the degree of unsaturation (DoU), we compare this to the formula for a saturated acyclic hydrocarbon, which is $C_nH_{2n+2}$.\nFor n=7, a saturated hydrocarbon is $C_7H_{16}$.\nThe given formula has 2 fewer hydrogens ($16 - 14 = 2$).\nEach degree of unsaturation (one double bond or one ring) corresponds to a loss of two hydrogens.\nTherefore, the DoU = $(16-14)/2 = 1$. The molecule contains either one double bond or one ring.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the $^{13}$C NMR Data**\nThe provided data is: $^{13}C$ NMR: 145(s), 112(t), 48(t), 27(d), 22(q), 21(q).\n*   **Number of Signals:** There are 6 distinct signals for a molecule with 7 carbon atoms. This means that two carbon atoms are chemically equivalent, and their signal overlaps with one of the given peaks. The problem hint also points this out.\n*   **Chemical Shifts and Multiplicities (DEPT information):**\n    *   **145 ppm (s):** The chemical shift is in the alkene region (100-150 ppm). The multiplicity 's' (singlet) indicates a quaternary carbon (a carbon with no attached hydrogens). This fragment is a quaternary carbon in a double bond: `>C=`.\n    *   **112 ppm (t):** The chemical shift is also in the alkene region. The multiplicity 't' (triplet) indicates a CH₂ group. This fragment is a terminal alkene carbon: `=CH₂`.\n    *   Combining these two alkene signals gives us a `>C=CH₂` (disubstituted terminal alkene) unit. This confirms the DoU of 1 is due to a double bond, not a ring.\n    *   **48 ppm (t):** This signal is in the alkane region. The multiplicity 't' indicates a CH₂ group (`-CH₂-`). The relatively high shift for an alkane CH₂ suggests it might be attached to the double bond.\n    *   **27 ppm (d):** This signal is in the alkane region. The multiplicity 'd' (doublet) indicates a CH group (`>CH-`).\n    *   **22 ppm (q):** This signal is in the alkane region. The multiplicity 'q' (quartet) indicates a CH₃ group (`-CH₃`).\n    *   **21 ppm (q):** This is another signal for a CH₃ group.\n\n**Step 3: Assemble the Structure**\nLet's list the structural fragments we've identified from the unique signals:\n1.  `>C=` (quaternary, s)\n2.  `=CH₂` (t)\n3.  `-CH₂-` (t)\n4.  `>CH-` (d)\n5.  `-CH₃` (q)\n6.  `-CH₃` (q)\n\nWe have 7 total carbons. The 6 signals imply either accidental equivalence (overlap) or that one signal represents two symmetrical carbons. Let's try to assemble the structure assuming we have a total of 7 carbons with the types suggested by the multiplicities. We need one more carbon than we have unique signals.\nThe observed multiplicities are: one s, two t, one d, two q. We have 7 carbons in total.\n*   The number of non-protonated carbons is 1 (from the 's' signal).\n*   The number of CH carbons is 1 (from the 'd' signal).\n*   The number of CH₂ carbons is 2 (from the two 't' signals).\n*   The number of CH₃ carbons is 3 (this would require three 'q' signals, but we only see two).\n\nThis discrepancy (expecting three CH₃ groups for a C7 total but seeing only two 'q' signals) is the key. It means two of the three CH₃ groups are chemically so similar that their signals overlap (accidental equivalence). So our total carbon inventory for the molecule is:\n*   1 x `>C=` (quaternary)\n*   1 x `=CH₂`\n*   1 x `-CH₂-`\n*   1 x `>CH-`\n*   3 x `-CH₃`\n\nLet's try to assemble these 7 carbons and 14 hydrogens into a single molecule.\n*   The core is the `>C=CH₂` unit.\n*   The remaining 5 carbons and 11 hydrogens must form alkyl groups attached to the quaternary carbon `>C=`. The fragments for this part are: one `-CH₂-`, one `>CH-`, and three `-CH₃`.\n*   A `>CH-` group and two `-CH₃` groups strongly suggest the presence of an **isopropyl group**, `-CH(CH₃)₂`. This uses up the `>CH-` and two of the `-CH₃` fragments.\n*   The remaining fragments are one `-CH₂-` and one `-CH₃`. These can only be connected to form an **ethyl group**, `-CH₂-CH₃`.\n*   Now, we attach the isopropyl group and the ethyl group to the quaternary carbon of the `>C=CH₂` unit.\n\nThe resulting structure is:\n        (CH₃)₂CH — C — CH₂CH₃\n                  ||\n                  CH₂\n\n**Step 4: Determine the IUPAC Name**\nTo name this structure, we find the longest continuous carbon chain that contains the double bond.\n1.  Chain 1: `¹CH₂=C²(isopropyl)-C³H₂-C⁴H₃`. This is a 1-butene chain with an isopropyl group at C-2. The name would be **2-isopropyl-1-butene**. This chain has one substituent.\n2.  Chain 2: `¹CH₂=C²(ethyl)-C³H(CH₃)-C⁴H₃`. This is a 1-butene chain with a methyl group at C-3. The name would be **2-ethyl-3-methyl-1-butene**. This chain has two substituents (ethyl and methyl).\n\nIUPAC rules state that if there is a tie for the longest chain, choose the one with the greatest number of substituents. Chain 2 gives two substituents, while Chain 1 gives only one. Therefore, the correct IUPAC name is based on Chain 2.\n\nThe IUPAC name is **2-ethyl-3-methyl-1-butene**.\n\n**Step 5: Final Check**\nLet's verify that 2-ethyl-3-methyl-1-butene matches all the data.\n*   **Formula:** The structure `CH₂=C(CH₂CH₃)CH(CH₃)₂` has 7 carbons and 14 hydrogens. Correct.\n*   **NMR Prediction:**\n    *   `=CH₂` (t) -> matches 112(t)\n    *   `=C<` (s) -> matches 145(s)\n    *   Ethyl `-CH₂-` (t) -> matches 48(t)\n    *   Isopropyl `>CH-` (d) -> matches 27(d)\n    *   Ethyl `-CH₃` (q)\n    *   Isopropyl two `-CH₃` groups (q, q) - these two methyls are diastereotopic and should have different signals.\n*   The structure is predicted to have 7 signals (s, t, t, d, q, q, q).\n*   The observed spectrum has 6 signals because two of the three methyl groups have accidentally identical chemical shifts, resulting in the two 'q' signals observed at 22 and 21 ppm. This is a very common occurrence.\n\nThe structure is fully consistent with all the given information.\n\n<<<2-ethyl-3-methyl-1-butene>>>"
