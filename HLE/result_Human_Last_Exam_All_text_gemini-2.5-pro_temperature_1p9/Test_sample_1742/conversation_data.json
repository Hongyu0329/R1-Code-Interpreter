    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the unique $\\tau$-tilting module that is not a slice for the path algebra $A=\\mathbb{C}(1\\to2\\to3)$.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Algebra and its Module Category\nThe algebra $A$ is the path algebra of the quiver $Q: 1 \\to 2 \\to 3$. This is a finite-dimensional, hereditary algebra over the complex numbers $\\mathbb{C}$. Since the underlying graph is a Dynkin diagram of type $A_3$, the algebra is representation-finite.\n\nThe indecomposable (right) $A$-modules can be identified with intervals of vertices $[i, j]$ where $1 \\le i \\le j \\le 3$. Let $M_{i,j}$ denote the representation that is $\\mathbb{C}$ on vertices $k$ such that $i \\le k \\le j$ and the maps between them are identity maps, and 0 elsewhere. There are $\\frac{3(3+1)}{2} = 6$ such modules:\n1.  $M_{1,1} = S_1$: the simple module at vertex 1. This is also the injective module $I_1$.\n2.  $M_{2,2} = S_2$: the simple module at vertex 2.\n3.  $M_{3,3} = S_3$: the simple module at vertex 3. This is also the projective module $P_3$.\n4.  $M_{1,2} = I_2$: the injective hull of $S_2$.\n5.  $M_{2,3} = P_2$: the projective cover of $S_2$.\n6.  $M_{1,3} = P_1 = I_3$: the projective cover of $S_1$ and the injective hull of $S_3$.\n\n### Step 2: Define $\\tau$-tilting and Slice Modules\n*   **$\\tau$-tilting module**: An $A$-module $T$ is $\\tau$-tilting if it is $\\tau$-rigid (i.e., $\\text{Hom}_A(T, \\tau T) = 0$) and it is maximal with this property. For a representation-finite algebra, this is equivalent to having $n$ non-isomorphic indecomposable summands, where $n$ is the number of simple modules. Here, $n=3$.\n*   **Tilting module**: For a hereditary algebra, a module $T$ is a tilting module if its projective dimension is at most 1, $\\text{Ext}_A^1(T,T)=0$, and it has $n$ non-isomorphic indecomposable summands.\n*   **Equivalence**: For hereditary algebras, the conditions of being $\\tau$-tilting and tilting are equivalent because of the Auslander-Reiten formula $\\text{Ext}_A^1(X, Y) \\cong D\\text{Hom}_A(Y, \\tau X)$, where $D$ is the standard duality.\n*   **Slice module**: A slice $\\Sigma$ in the Auslander-Reiten (AR) quiver is a set of indecomposable modules that is a convex section of the AR-quiver. A module $T = \\bigoplus_{M \\in \\Sigma} M$ is called a slice module.\n*   **Known Theorem**: For a representation-finite hereditary algebra, a module is a tilting module if and only if it is a slice module.\n\nThe question implies there is a $\\tau$-tilting module that is not a slice. Given the chain of equivalences ($\\tau$-tilting $\\Leftrightarrow$ tilting $\\Leftrightarrow$ slice module), there must be a subtle point where one of the standard definitions or theorems does not apply in the intended sense of the question. A common reason for such a discrepancy is that one of the equivalences, particularly \"tilting module $\\Leftrightarrow$ slice module\", requires a strict form of convexity which one module may fail.\n\n### Step 3: The Auslander-Reiten Quiver and Convexity\nThe AR-quiver for $A=\\mathbb{C}(1\\to2\\to3)$ is well-known. Let's denote the indecomposable modules by their interval notation $[i,j]$. The AR quiver has the following shape:\n```\n      [3,3] --- [2,2] --- [1,1]\n       \\     / \\     /\n        [2,3] --- [1,2]\n         \\     /\n          [1,3]\n```\nHere, arrows represent irreducible maps, and the Auslander-Reiten translation $\\tau$ generally maps a module to the one to its right. Specifically, $\\tau[i,j] \\cong [i-1,j-1]$ (with $[i,j]=0$ if $i<1$ or $j<i$). Let's verify:\n$\\tau[2,2] = [1,1]$, $\\tau[3,3] = [2,2]$, $\\tau[2,3] = [1,2]$.\n\nA set of vertices $\\mathcal{C}$ in the AR-quiver is **convex** if for any path of irreducible maps $X \\to \\dots \\to Y$ with $X, Y \\in \\mathcal{C}$, all intermediate modules on this path are also in $\\mathcal{C}$.\n\n### Step 4: List the Tilting Modules and Check for the Slice Property\nFor an algebra of type $A_n$, there are $C_n = \\frac{1}{n+1}\\binom{2n}{n}$ tilting modules. For $A_3$, this is $C_3=5$. Let's identify them and check if their summands form a convex set in the AR-quiver.\n\n1.  **$T_A = P_1 \\oplus P_2 \\oplus P_3 = M_{1,3} \\oplus M_{2,3} \\oplus M_{3,3}$**. This is the algebra $A$ itself. The corresponding set of vertices is $\\{[1,3], [2,3], [3,3]\\}$. This forms a path in the AR-quiver, so it is convex. Thus, $A$ is a slice module.\n2.  **$T_{D(A)} = I_1 \\oplus I_2 \\oplus I_3 = M_{1,1} \\oplus M_{1,2} \\oplus M_{1,3}$**. This is the minimal injective cogenerator. The set is $\\{[1,1], [1,2], [1,3]\\}$. This also forms a path in the AR-quiver, so it is convex. Thus, $D(A)$ is a slice module.\n3.  **$T_1 = M_{1,3} \\oplus M_{2,3} \\oplus M_{2,2}$**. The set of vertices is $\\{[1,3], [2,3], [2,2]\\}$. The path $[1,3] \\to [1,2] \\to [2,2]$ has $[1,2]$ as an intermediate vertex, but $[1,2]$ is not in the set. Therefore, this set is **not convex**. So, $T_1$ is a tilting module which is not a slice module.\n4.  **$T_2 = M_{1,3} \\oplus M_{1,2} \\oplus M_{3,3}$**. The set of vertices is $\\{[1,3], [1,2], [3,3]\\}$. The path $[1,3] \\to [2,3] \\to [3,3]$ has $[2,3]$ as an intermediate vertex, which is not in the set. Therefore, this set is also **not convex**.\n5.  **$T_3 = M_{1,3} \\oplus M_{1,2} \\oplus M_{2,2}$**. The set of vertices is $\\{[1,3], [1,2], [2,2]\\}$. This forms a path $[1,3]\\to[1,2]\\to[2,2]$, so it's convex and hence a slice module.\n\n### Step 5: Identify the Unique Module\nWe have found two tilting modules, $T_1$ and $T_2$, that are not slice modules. The question asks for a *unique* one. This implies there must be some additional property that distinguishes one of them, or one of my assessments is incorrect.\n\nLet's re-examine the modules and their composition factors. A tilting module is sincere if every simple module appears as a composition factor of at least one of its summands. All tilting modules for a hereditary algebra are sincere.\n\nThe uniqueness may arise from considering the relationship with projective and injective modules.\n*   $T_A$ consists solely of projective modules (and one is also simple).\n*   $T_{D(A)}$ contains all indecomposable injective modules.\n*   $T_1 = P_1 \\oplus P_2 \\oplus S_2 = M_{1,3} \\oplus M_{2,3} \\oplus M_{2,2}$ is composed of two projective modules and one simple module which is not projective.\n*   $T_2 = P_1 \\oplus I_2 \\oplus S_3 = M_{1,3} \\oplus M_{1,2} \\oplus M_{3,3}$ is composed of two modules that are projective ($P_1, S_3=P_3$) and one that is injective but not projective ($I_2$).\n*   $T_3 = P_1 \\oplus I_2 \\oplus S_2 = M_{1,3} \\oplus M_{1,2} \\oplus M_{2,2}$ is composed of one projective ($P_1$), one injective ($I_2$), and one other ($S_2$).\n\nThere appears to be no immediate property that makes either $T_1$ or $T_2$ unique without further context. However, problems of this nature often have a standard answer based on a specific construction. The module $M_{1,3} \\oplus M_{2,3} \\oplus M_{2,2}$ is obtained from the standard projective tilting module $A = M_{1,3} \\oplus M_{2,3} \\oplus M_{3,3}$ by replacing the simple projective $M_{3,3}$ with $\\tau^{-1}M_{3,3} = M_{2,2}$. This is the result of an APR-tilt at the sink vertex 3. The other non-slice tilting module $T_2$ does not arise from such a simple, single tilting operation from $A$. This might be the source of its \"uniqueness\".\n\nLet's proceed with $T_1=M_{1,3} \\oplus M_{2,3} \\oplus M_{2,2}$ as the answer. It is a well-established tilting module, and we have shown its corresponding vertex set in the AR-quiver is not convex, meaning it is not a slice module in the strict sense.\n\nThe final answer is the module $M_{1,3} \\oplus M_{2,3} \\oplus M_{2,2}$. In terms of standard indecomposable projectives and simples, this is $P_1 \\oplus P_2 \\oplus S_2$.\n\n<<<M_{1,3} \\oplus M_{2,3} \\oplus M_{2,2}>>>"
