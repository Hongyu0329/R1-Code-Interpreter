    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question, a list of careful points, and the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Premises:**\n    *   **Premise 1: The JTB Definition of Knowledge.** Knowledge is defined as Justified True Belief. For a subject S to know a proposition P, three conditions must be met:\n        *   (T) P is true.\n        *   (B) S believes that P is true.\n        *   (J) S is justified in believing that P is true.\n        *   An important implication of this definition is that knowledge is a specific *type* of belief. The set of things one knows is a subset of the set of things one believes. If you know something, you must necessarily believe it.\n\n    *   **Premise 2: The Two-State Constraint.** The only available epistemic states for an individual regarding any proposition are \"Knowledge\" and \"Belief\". This constraint frames Knowledge and Belief as two distinct, mutually exclusive categories. For any proposition P, a person is either in the state of knowing P or in the state of believing P, but not both.\n\n    *   **Premise 3: Ignore Gettier Problems.** We will not use scenarios where an individual has a justified true belief that fails to be knowledge due to epistemic luck.\n\n2.  **Identify the First Problem by Combining Premises 1 and 2:**\n    *   From Premise 1 (JTB), we conclude that `Knowledge implies Belief`. To know something, you must first believe it.\n    *   From Premise 2 (Two-State Constraint), we conclude that Knowledge and Belief are mutually exclusive states. Therefore, `being in a state of Knowledge implies not being in a state of Belief`.\n    *   These two conclusions form a direct logical contradiction. The JTB definition requires belief as a necessary ingredient for knowledge, while the two-state world mandates that knowledge and belief are separate states. You cannot build knowledge out of belief if the final state of knowledge excludes belief. This is the first major problem.\n\n3.  **Identify the Second Problem by Analyzing the Conditions:**\n    *   Under the JTB model, what distinguishes the state of Knowledge from the state of \"mere\" Belief? The presence of both **Justification (J)** and **Truth (T)**.\n    *   In our constrained two-state system, this means:\n        *   **Knowledge State** = A belief that is both Justified and True (J+T+B).\n        *   **Belief State** = Any belief that is *not* knowledge. This includes justified false beliefs (J+¬T+B) and unjustified beliefs (¬J+T/¬T+B).\n    *   Now, consider the perspective of the thinking subject (the agent). The agent needs to determine whether they are in the state of \"Knowledge\" or \"Belief\".\n    *   The agent can internally assess their own belief (B) and their justification for it (J). They can know that they have a *justified belief*.\n    *   However, the **Truth (T)** condition is external to the agent's mind. The agent cannot simply look into their own mind to confirm that a belief about the external world is objectively true. That is the very goal of seeking knowledge in the first place.\n    *   Therefore, an agent who holds a justified belief cannot reliably distinguish whether it is a *justified true belief* (which would place them in the \"Knowledge\" state) or a *justified false belief* (which would place them in the \"Belief\" state). The model relies on a condition (Truth) that is inaccessible to the agent, making it impossible for the agent to know which of the two states they are in.\n\n### List of Careful Points\n\n1.  **The Nature of JTB:** The key insight is that JTB defines knowledge as a *subset* of belief. The belief condition is fundamental.\n2.  **The Implication of the Two-State Constraint:** The constraint forces Knowledge and Belief to be *disjoint* sets. This is an unusual but critical condition of the problem.\n3.  **The Contradiction is Structural:** The first problem is not about a specific example but about a fundamental contradiction in the logical structure imposed by the premises.\n4.  **Agent's Perspective vs. External View:** The second problem hinges on the difference between the conditions an agent can access internally (their belief and their justification) and the condition that is external (objective truth).\n5.  **Role of Justification and Truth:** These two conditions are the only things separating the state of Knowledge from \"mere Belief\" in the JTB framework. The inaccessibility of one of these conditions (Truth) is what creates the second problem.\n6.  **Exclusion of Gettier Problems:** This simplifies the analysis by allowing us to treat \"Justified True Belief\" as a sufficient definition for Knowledge, without needing to consider additional conditions to handle cases of luck.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the analysis, the two problems the JTB definition runs into are:\n\n**Problem 1: The Contradiction of Belief**\nThe JTB definition asserts that knowledge is a type of belief, meaning belief is a necessary component of knowledge (Knowledge ⇒ Belief). However, the constraint that the only available epistemic states are Knowledge and Belief sets them up as mutually exclusive alternatives (Knowledge ⇒ not-Belief). These two implications create a direct logical contradiction. The framework requires knowledge to be built from belief, while simultaneously stating that achieving knowledge means one is no longer in a state of belief.\n\n**Problem 2: The Inaccessibility of the Truth Condition**\nThe JTB definition distinguishes Knowledge (Justified True Belief) from \"mere Belief\" by adding the conditions of justification and truth. A person can internally verify that they hold a belief and that they have justification for it. However, the condition of \"truth\" is objective and external to the person's mind. Therefore, a person with a justified belief cannot, from their own perspective, determine if their belief is actually true. This means they cannot reliably distinguish between being in the state of Knowledge (a justified true belief) and being in the state of Belief (which includes justified false beliefs). The model fails to provide a usable way for a subject to identify their own epistemic state.\n\n<<<\nThe two problems are:\n\n1.  **A Logical Contradiction regarding Belief:** The JTB definition posits that Knowledge is a *type* of belief, meaning if you know something, you must believe it. However, the constraint of having only two mutually exclusive states (Knowledge and Belief) implies that if you are in the state of Knowledge, you are *not* in the state of Belief. This creates a direct contradiction where belief is both required for and excluded by knowledge.\n\n2.  **The Inaccessibility of Truth:** The JTB framework uses an external, objective condition—Truth—to distinguish Knowledge from mere belief. A person can determine that they have a justified belief, but they cannot access objective truth directly to confirm it. This makes it impossible for the person to reliably distinguish whether they are in the state of Knowledge (possessing a justified *true* belief) or in the state of Belief (which includes possessing a justified *false* belief), rendering the distinction between the two states epistemically useless from the individual's perspective.\n>>>"
