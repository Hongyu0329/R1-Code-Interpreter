The two problems are:

1.  **A Logical Contradiction regarding Belief:** The JTB definition posits that Knowledge is a *type* of belief, meaning if you know something, you must believe it. However, the constraint of having only two mutually exclusive states (Knowledge and Belief) implies that if you are in the state of Knowledge, you are *not* in the state of Belief. This creates a direct contradiction where belief is both required for and excluded by knowledge.

2.  **The Inaccessibility of Truth:** The JTB framework uses an external, objective condition—Truth—to distinguish Knowledge from mere belief. A person can determine that they have a justified belief, but they cannot access objective truth directly to confirm it. This makes it impossible for the person to reliably distinguish whether they are in the state of Knowledge (possessing a justified *true* belief) or in the state of Belief (which includes possessing a justified *false* belief), rendering the distinction between the two states epistemically useless from the individual's perspective.
