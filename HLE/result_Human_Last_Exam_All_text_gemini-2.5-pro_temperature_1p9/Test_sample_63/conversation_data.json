    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe question asks for the name of a specific person based on three key clues:\n1.  The observation that he \"looks like a porcupine in all the pictures\" was made by the author Kurt Vonnegut.\n2.  The name must consist of two words.\n3.  Both words in the name must start with the same letter.\n\n**Step 2: Trace the Quote to its Source**\nThe central clue is the quote attributed to Kurt Vonnegut. The first step is to find where Vonnegut made this statement. A search for `\"Kurt Vonnegut\" \"looks like a porcupine\"` will be the most direct way to find the source.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Subject of the Quote**\nResearch reveals that the quote appears in Kurt Vonnegut's 1974 collection of non-fiction, *Wampeters, Foma & Granfalloons*. Specifically, in the introduction to his short play \"Fortitude,\" Vonnegut writes: \"It has been noted that Mr. Bacharach looks like a porcupine in all his pictures. I might as well note that here, too.\" The person he is referring to is the famous American composer and pianist.\n\n**Step 4: Verify the Name against the Constraints**\nThe man identified is Burt Bacharach. Let's check this name against the remaining clues:\n*   **Is it a two-word name?** Yes, \"Burt Bacharach\" consists of two words.\n*   **Do both words start with the same letter?** Yes, both \"Burt\" and \"Bacharach\" start with the letter 'B'.\n\nAll the conditions given in the question have been met. The man's appearance, particularly his distinct spiky hair in photos from the era, aligns with Vonnegut's description of a porcupine.\n\n**Step 5: Formulate the Final Answer**\nBased on the analysis, the man's name is Burt Bacharach.\n\n<<<Burt Bacharach>>>"
