The product is a complex tricyclic ketone formed via an anionic oxy-Cope rearrangement. The reaction involves the deprotonation of the alcohol, followed by a [3,3]-sigmatropic shift that breaks the C1-C2 bond of the norbornene skeleton and forms a new C-C bond between C5 of the norbornene and C2' of the cyclopentenyl ring. Subsequent workup protonates the resulting enolate to yield the ketone.

The final product has the following key structural features:
- The bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene ring is opened.
- A ketone group is present at the C2 position.
- A new C-C bond exists between C5 and C2'.
- A C=C double bond is now between C1 and C6.
- The resulting structure is a fused tricyclic system, whose skeleton can be described as a fusion of a 5-membered ring (C1-C7-C4-C5-C6), a 6-membered ring (C2-C3-C4-C5-C2'-C1'), and another 5-membered ring (the original cyclopentyl moiety).
