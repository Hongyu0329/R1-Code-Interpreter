    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the two languages.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstructing the Question**\nThe core requirements for the two languages are:\n1.  **Origin:** Both must be from Asia.\n2.  **Cultural Contact:** They must belong to cultures with no direct historical contact. This implies they should be from different language families and geographically distant regions of Asia. This suggests the word similarities are likely coincidental (false cognates) rather than from borrowing.\n3.  **Vocabulary Match:** The words for \"broom\", \"mom\", and \"dad\" must be \"nearly identical or highly similar\".\n\n**Step 2: Analyzing the Words**\n*   **\"Mom\" and \"Dad\":** Words like \"mama,\" \"papa,\" \"amma,\" \"appa,\" and \"baba\" are extremely common across unrelated languages worldwide. This is a well-known linguistic phenomenon called \"nursery words\" or \"papa/mama words,\" linked to the simple sounds (like /m/, /p/, /b/, /a/) that infants first learn to make. Finding languages that share these words will be relatively easy.\n*   **\"Broom\":** This is the key word. Unlike \"mom\" or \"dad,\" the word for a cultural object like a broom is arbitrary. A coincidental similarity in this word, combined with the other two, would make for a very strong answer.\n\n**Step 3: Brainstorming and Testing Language Pairs**\nWe need a pair of languages from distant corners of Asia, for example, West Asia and East Asia.\n\n*   **Candidate Pair 1: Tamil (South Asia) and Korean (East Asia)**\n    *   **Contact:** No direct contact. They belong to unrelated families (Dravidian and Koreanic).\n    *   **Words:**\n        *   Mom: Tamil `Amma` (அம்மா) | Korean `Eomma` (엄마) -> **Excellent match.**\n        *   Dad: Tamil `Appa` (அப்பா) | Korean `Appa` (아빠) -> **Identical.**\n        *   Broom: Tamil `Thudappam` (துடைப்பம்) | Korean `Bitjaru` (빗자루) -> **No match.**\n    *   **Conclusion:** This pair fails on the word for \"broom\".\n\n*   **Candidate Pair 2: Persian/Farsi (West Asia) and Korean (East Asia)**\n    *   **Contact:** No direct, sustained cultural contact to influence basic vocabulary. They belong to unrelated families (Indo-European and Koreanic). This pair fits the separation criteria.\n    *   **Words:**\n        *   **Mom:** Persian `Mâmân` (مامان) | Korean `Eomma` (엄마). Both are classic \"mama\" forms and sound very similar.\n        *   **Dad:** Persian `Bâbâ` (بابا) | Korean `Appa` (아빠). Both are classic \"papa/baba\" forms with a repeated syllable using a labial stop (`b`/`p`) and the vowel /a/. They are highly similar in structure and sound.\n        *   **Broom:** Persian `Jâru` (جارو) | Korean `Bitjaru` (빗자루). This is a remarkable similarity. The Korean word is a compound of `bit` (\"comb\") and `jaru` (which can mean \"handle\" or refer to the tool itself). The Persian word for the entire object is `Jâru`. The core component for the tool is nearly identical.\n\n**Step 4: Final Verification**\nThe Korean and Persian/Farsi language pair meets all the conditions:\n1.  **Asian Cultures:** Korea is in East Asia, and Iran (Persia) is in West Asia.\n2.  **No Direct Contact:** They are genealogically and geographically separate. The similarities are coincidental, not due to borrowing.\n3.  **Similar Words:**\n    *   **Broom:** Korean `(-jaru)` and Persian `Jâru` are nearly identical.\n    *   **Mom:** Korean `Eomma` and Persian `Mâmân` are highly similar \"mama\" forms.\n    *   **Dad:** Korean `Appa` and Persian `Bâbâ` are highly similar \"papa/baba\" forms.\n\nThis pair provides a compelling answer to the question.\n\n<<<**Korean** and **Persian (Farsi)** are two such languages.\n\n1.  **Broom:**\n    *   Korean: `Bitjaru` (빗자루) — where `jaru` refers to the implement.\n    *   Persian: `Jâru` (جارو)\n    The core word component is nearly identical.\n\n2.  **Mom:**\n    *   Korean: `Eomma` (엄마)\n    *   Persian: `Mâmân` (مامان)\n    Both are highly similar \"mama\" type words common in nursery language.\n\n3.  **Dad:**\n    *   Korean: `Appa` (아빠)\n    *   Persian: `Bâbâ` (بابا)\n    Both are highly similar \"papa/baba\" type words, using a repeated labial consonant and the vowel 'a'.>>>"
