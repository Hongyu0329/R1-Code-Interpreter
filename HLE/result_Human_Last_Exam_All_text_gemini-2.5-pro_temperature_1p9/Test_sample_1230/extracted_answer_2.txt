Charles needs to first adjust his diet. The current diet, which limits animal protein, fat, and carbohydrates simultaneously, is overly restrictive and likely unsustainable.

He should adjust his diet to be more balanced—for instance, by ensuring adequate intake of lean protein and healthy fats for satiety while managing overall calorie intake—to make it more manageable for long-term adherence, especially with his travel-intensive lifestyle.
