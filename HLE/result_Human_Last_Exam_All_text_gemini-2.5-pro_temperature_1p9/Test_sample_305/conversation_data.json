    "An associative and commutative binary operation on a set is also known as a commutative semigroup. We need to find the number of distinct such operations on a set S with 3 elements. Let S = {a, b, c}. A binary operation is a function f: S × S → S. We are looking for the number of such functions that satisfy the commutative (x*y = y*x) and associative ((x*y)*z = x*(y*z)) properties.\n\nWe can solve this problem by classifying the possible structures based on the number of idempotent elements. An element x is idempotent if x*x = x. Let E be the set of idempotent elements. For any finite semigroup, the set E is non-empty. So, for our set S of 3 elements, the number of idempotents |E| can be 1, 2, or 3.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the case where all elements are idempotent (|E|=3)\n\nIf every element is idempotent (a*a=a, b*b=b, c*c=c), the operation is a semilattice. The number of such operations is the number of distinct semilattices that can be defined on a labeled set of 3 elements. A semilattice structure is equivalent to a partial order where every pair of elements has a meet (greatest lower bound) or a join (least upper bound).\n\nThe possible partial order structures (up to isomorphism) on 3 elements that form semilattices are:\n1.  **The chain:** The elements are totally ordered (e.g., a < b < c). A chain is both a meet- and join-semilattice.\n    *   There are 3! = 6 possible linear orderings of {a, b, c}.\n    *   For each ordering, we can define a `meet` operation (x*y = min(x,y)) and a `join` operation (x*y = max(x,y)).\n    *   The `meet` operation for an order (e.g., a<b<c) results in the same multiplication table as the `join` operation for the reverse order (c>b>a).\n    *   So, we have 6 distinct orderings, giving 3 pairs of (order, reverse_order). Each pair gives rise to one meet-type table and one join-type table. For example, `meet(a<b<c)` is different from `join(a<b<c)`. And `meet(a<b<c)` is different from `meet(a<c<b)`. So the 6 orderings give 6 distinct semilattice operations.\n    *   **Count: 6**\n2.  **The 'V' shape:** One element is the maximum, and the other two are incomparable (e.g., a<c, b<c). This is a join-semilattice.\n    *   We can choose the maximum element in 3 ways (a, b, or c). The other two elements are interchangeable.\n    *   This gives 3 distinct labeled operations.\n    *   **Count: 3**\n3.  **The 'Lambda' (^) shape:** One element is the minimum, and the other two are incomparable (e.g., c<a, c<b). This is a meet-semilattice.\n    *   Similar to the V-shape, we can choose the minimum element in 3 ways.\n    *   This gives 3 distinct labeled operations.\n    *   **Count: 3**\n\nTotal for |E|=3: 6 + 3 + 3 = 12 operations.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the case with exactly two idempotent elements (|E|=2)\n\nLet the idempotents be {a, b}, so a*a=a and b*b=b. The third element c is not idempotent, so c*c must be either a or b.\nA key class of structures with two idempotents is one that has both an identity element (1) and a zero element (0). Both the identity and zero are always idempotent.\nLet a=1 and b=0. Then the operation has to satisfy 1*x = x and 0*x = 0 for all x. The third element c is not idempotent, so c*c = 0 or c*c = 1. For the operation to be associative, it turns out that c*c must be the zero element.\n*   Structure: S={1, 0, c} with c*c = 0.\n*   Counting them: We need to assign the roles of '1', '0', and 'c' to the elements {a, b, c}.\n    *   Choose the two idempotent elements: C(3, 2) = 3 ways ({a,b}, {a,c}, {b,c}).\n    *   For each pair, choose which is the identity and which is the zero: 2 ways.\n    *   The remaining element plays the role of 'c'.\n    *   This gives 3 * 2 = 6 distinct operations.\n*   **Count: 6**\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the case with exactly one idempotent element (|E|=1)\n\nLet the single idempotent be 'a', so a*a=a. The elements b and c are not idempotent.\nThere are two main families of structures that fit this description:\n\n1.  **The cyclic group of order 3 (Z₃):**\n    *   In a finite group, only the identity element is idempotent. So for Z₃, |E|=1.\n    *   To count the number of such tables on {a,b,c}, we can choose which element acts as the identity in 3 ways. Once the identity is chosen (e.g., 'a'), the rest of the table is fixed (b*b=c, c*c=b, b*c=a). The choice of which non-identity element is the generator doesn't change the resulting table.\n    *   Number of such distinct operations = 3! / |Aut(Z₃)| = 6 / 2 = 3.\n    *   **Count: 3**\n2.  **The constant semigroup:**\n    *   The operation is defined as x*y = z for a fixed element z ∈ S.\n    *   Let's check idempotency: x*x=z. An element x is idempotent if and only if x=z. So there is exactly one idempotent, z.\n    *   This operation is commutative and associative: (x*y)*z' = z*z' = z, and x*(y*z') = x*z = z.\n    *   We can choose the constant element z in 3 ways.\n    *   **Count: 3**\n\n### Step 4: Summing the results\n\nThe classes of semigroups are disjoint based on the number of their idempotent elements. We sum the counts from each case:\n*   From |E|=3 (semilattices): 12 operations\n*   From |E|=2 (identity and zero): 6 operations\n*   From |E|=1 (groups and constant): 3 + 3 = 6 operations\n\nTotal number of associative and commutative binary operations = 12 + 6 + 6 = 24."
