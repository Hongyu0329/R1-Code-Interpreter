    "This problem requires us to perform a case-insensitive lexicographical comparison of two strings of the same length. The main challenge specified is to devise a solution that is \"the most memory-efficient\" and to calculate the total memory in bytes used for the variables in that solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The primary objective is to compare two strings (`s1`, `s2`) lexicographically, ignoring case. We need to output -1 if `s1 < s2`, 1 if `s1 > s2`, and 0 if `s1 == s2`. The secondary, but crucial, objective is to minimize the memory used by variables.\n\n2.  **Analyze Input and Constraints:**\n    *   Two strings are provided on two separate lines.\n    *   They consist of uppercase and lowercase Latin letters.\n    *   Their lengths are equal and range from 1 to 100.\n    *   The case-insensitive comparison is the key rule (e.g., 'a' == 'A').\n\n3.  **Strategy for Memory Efficiency:**\n    *   A standard approach would use two character arrays, `char s1[101]` and `char s2[101]`, to store both strings. This would consume `101 + 101 = 202` bytes just for the buffers.\n    *   To optimize memory, we must question if storing both strings is necessary. The input is sequential: first `string1`, then `string2`. To compare the characters at a specific position `i`, `s1[i]` and `s2[i]`, we need both available. When our program is reading `s2[i]` from the input stream, it has already passed `s1[i]`. This means we cannot have access to `s1[i]` unless we have stored it.\n    *   Therefore, **storing the first string is unavoidable**.\n    *   However, we **can avoid storing the second string**. We can read it one character at a time and perform the comparison \"on the fly\" against the corresponding character from the stored first string.\n\n4.  **The Most Memory-Efficient Algorithm:**\n    1.  Declare a buffer to store the first string. Since the maximum length is 100, we need a `char` array of size 101 to accommodate the string and its null terminator (`\\0`). This is our largest necessary memory allocation.\n    2.  Read the first string into this buffer. `scanf(\"%s\", ...)` is a simple way to do this.\n    3.  After reading the first string, a newline character (`\\n`) remains in the input stream. We must consume it before reading the second string. A call to `getchar()` can do this.\n    4.  Declare an index variable to iterate through our stored string. The index will range from 0 to 99. The most memory-efficient standard integer type for this is `unsigned char`, which uses only **1 byte** and can hold values from 0 to 255.\n    5.  Declare a variable to hold the characters being read from the second string. Since we'll use `getchar()` for this, the variable must be an `int` to correctly handle the special `EOF` (End-of-File) value. An `int` typically uses **4 bytes**.\n    6.  Loop, reading one character at a time from the second string. In each iteration, compare the character from the input with the character at the current index of the stored first string. Use the `tolower()` function from `<ctype.h>` for case-insensitive comparison.\n    7.  If a difference is found, print -1 or 1 immediately and exit the program.\n    8.  If the loop completes without finding any difference, it means the strings are equal, so print 0.\n\n### Careful Points and Variable Memory Calculation\n\nFollowing the memory-efficient algorithm, let's list the variables required and their sizes on a typical competitive programming platform (e.g., a system where `sizeof(char)` is 1 and `sizeof(int)` is 4).\n\n1.  **Buffer for the first string:** `char s1[101];`\n    *   This is an array of 101 characters.\n    *   Memory = `101 * sizeof(char)` = `101 * 1` byte = **101 bytes**.\n\n2.  **Index for the buffer:** `unsigned char i;`\n    *   An `unsigned char` is sufficient for an index up to 100 and is the smallest integer type.\n    *   Memory = `sizeof(unsigned char)` = **1 byte**.\n\n3.  **Variable to read from the second string:** `int c2;`\n    *   This must be an `int` to properly handle the return value of `getchar()`, which includes the `EOF` constant.\n    *   Memory = `sizeof(int)` = **4 bytes**.\n\nNo other variables are strictly necessary for the program's logic.\n\n**Total Memory (m):**\nThe total memory `m` is the sum of the memory used by all these variables.\n`m` = (memory for `s1`) + (memory for `i`) + (memory for `c2`)\n`m` = 101 bytes + 1 byte + 4 bytes = 106 bytes.\n\n<<<106>>>"
