    "Answering this question requires understanding several key concepts from the field of topology, specifically continuum theory. Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Definitions\n\n*   **Continuum:** A continuum is a compact, connected, Hausdorff topological space. The question specifies \"not necessarily metric,\" so we must use this more general definition rather than one requiring a metric space.\n*   **Indecomposable Continuum:** A continuum $X$ is said to be indecomposable if it cannot be expressed as the union of two of its proper subcontinua. Formally, if $X = A \\cup B$ where $A$ and $B$ are subcontinua (compact, connected subspaces) of $X$, then either $A=X$ or $B=X$.\n*   **Composant:** For a given point $p$ in a continuum $X$, the composant of $p$, denoted $C(p)$, is the set of all points $q \\in X$ for which there exists a proper subcontinuum of $X$ containing both $p$ and $q$. The relation \"being in the same composant\" is an equivalence relation, so the composants of a continuum form a partition of the space.\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing Composants in an Indecomposable Continuum\n\nWe need to determine the possible number of these composants for an indecomposable continuum and find the minimum value.\n\n**Key Property 1: Every proper subcontinuum is contained in a single composant.**\nLet $K$ be a proper subcontinuum of $X$. If we pick any two points $x, y \\in K$, then by definition, $K$ itself is a proper subcontinuum containing both $x$ and $y$. This means that $y$ is in the composant of $x$. Since this holds for any pair of points in $K$, all points of $K$ must belong to the same composant.\n\n**Key Property 2: Every composant of an indecomposable continuum is dense.**\nThis is a fundamental theorem in continuum theory. Let's sketch the reasoning. Let $C$ be a composant of an indecomposable continuum $X$. If $C$ were not dense in $X$, its closure $\\bar{C}$ would be a proper subcontinuum of $X$. By definition, $C$ is the union of all proper subcontinua containing one of its points, say $p$. Since $\\bar{C}$ is a proper subcontinuum containing $p$, we must have $\\bar{C} \\subseteq C$. Combined with $C \\subseteq \\bar{C}$, this implies $C=\\bar{C}$, so $C$ is a proper subcontinuum. It can then be shown that this leads to a contradiction with the indecomposability of $X$. While the full proof is intricate, the result is standard and holds for non-metric continua as well.\n\nSince all composants are dense in $X$ and they are pairwise disjoint, it immediately follows that there must be more than one composant. If there were only one, it would have to be the entire space $X$, but we can create a more rigorous argument.\n\n### Step 3: Determining the Lower Bound on the Number of Composants\n\nLet's assume an indecomposable continuum $X$ has only one composant.\n1.  If $X$ has only one composant, it means that for any two distinct points $p, q \\in X$, there exists a proper subcontinuum $K \\subset X$ such that $\\{p, q\\} \\subseteq K$.\n2.  A continuum with this property is called an **aposyndetic** continuum.\n3.  A major theorem in continuum theory, originally proved by F. B. Jones for metric continua and later extended to the non-metric case by C. L. Hagopian, states that **every aposyndetic continuum is decomposable**.\n4.  Our continuum $X$ is stipulated to be indecomposable. This directly contradicts the conclusion from point (3).\n5.  Therefore, our initial assumption must be false. An indecomposable continuum cannot have only one composant.\n6.  Since the number of composants must be an integer greater than 1 (or an infinite cardinal), the minimum possible number of composants is at least 2.\n\n### Step 4: Showing the Lower Bound is Achievable\n\nNow we need to confirm whether it is possible for an indecomposable continuum to have exactly two composants.\n\n1.  The existence of such continua is a classic result in continuum theory.\n2.  There are several known constructions of indecomposable continua with a finite number of composants. A common method involves creating \"Lakes of Wada\" type boundaries. For instance, one can construct two disjoint open regions in the plane whose boundaries are identical, and this common boundary forms an indecomposable continuum.\n3.  In such a construction with two \"lakes\", the set of points on the boundary accessible from the first lake forms one composant, and the set of points accessible from the second lake forms the other composant. The entire boundary is the union of these two disjoint, dense composants.\n4.  More generally, for any integer $n \\ge 2$, it is possible to construct an indecomposable continuum with exactly $n$ composants. Such continua also exist with countably infinite ($\\aleph_0$) or continuum-many ($2^{\\aleph_0}$) composants.\n\nSince it is possible to construct an indecomposable continuum with exactly 2 composants, the lower bound of 2 is achievable.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   An indecomposable continuum must have more than one composant. The minimum number is therefore at least 2.\n*   Constructions of indecomposable continua with exactly 2 composants exist.\n*   Therefore, the smallest number of composants an indecomposable continuum can have is 2.\n\n<<<2>>>"
