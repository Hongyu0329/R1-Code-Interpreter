    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the minimum number of non-top-facing stickers required to identify a PLL case.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Goal\nThe question asks for the minimum number of stickers on the side faces of the last layer that must be observed to uniquely identify any of the 21 PLL (Permutation of the Last Layer) cases, plus the solved state. The solver is in the final step of the CFOP method. The top face (e.g., yellow) is already oriented correctly, but the 8 pieces of the last layer (4 corners and 4 edges) are not yet in their final positions. We need to determine the permutation by looking at the side stickers. There are 12 such stickers in total (one on each edge piece, two on each corner piece).\n\n### Step 2: The Core of the Problem - Eliminating Ambiguity\nTo \"fully identify\" a case, our set of observed stickers must provide a unique signature for each of the 22 possibilities (21 PLLs + solved). If any two different cases could produce the same signature with our chosen stickers, then that number of stickers is insufficient. The challenge is that we can rotate the top layer (an \"AUF\" or Adjust Upper Face move), so we must be able to identify the case regardless of its orientation.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Information Required (Theoretical Minimum)\n*   There are 22 states to distinguish.\n*   In information theory, this requires at least `log₂(22)` bits of information, which is approximately 4.46 bits.\n*   Each side sticker can be one of four possible colors (e.g., Red, Orange, Green, Blue). The information from one sticker is `log₂(4) = 2` bits.\n*   Therefore, theoretically, we need at least `ceil(4.46 / 2) = 3` stickers. This assumes perfect information distribution, which is not guaranteed. We must test if 3 stickers are sufficient in practice.\n\n### Step 4: Testing the Sufficiency of 3 Stickers\nThe key question is: Is it possible to be \"fooled\" if you only look at 3 stickers? If we can find a single scenario where two different PLL cases look identical through the \"window\" of 3 chosen stickers, then 3 is not enough.\n\nLet's construct a counterexample.\n1.  **Consider the \"Na-Permutation\" PLL case.** This case swaps the diagonal corners UBR-UFL and the diagonal corners ULB-URF, along with a 5-piece cycle for the edges. From one specific angle (after an AUF), the Na-perm results in one entire face (e.g., the Front face) being completely solved. This means the `UFL` corner, `UF` edge, and `URF` corner are all in their correct positions and appear solved.\n2.  **Compare this with the \"Solved\" state.** In the solved state, every piece is in its correct position.\n3.  **Observe with 3 stickers.** Imagine our method for identifying the PLL is to look at the three stickers on the Front face.\n    *   In the **Solved** state, all three stickers on the Front face will match the color of that face's center piece.\n    *   In the **Na-perm** (viewed from the specific angle mentioned above), the three stickers on the Front face will *also* match the color of that face's center piece.\n4.  **The Ambiguity.** Based only on these 3 stickers, the Na-perm and the Solved state are indistinguishable. The permutation of the other 5 pieces on the layer remains unseen and unknown.\n\nSince there exists a valid scenario where looking at 3 stickers is insufficient to guarantee the correct identification, 3 cannot be the minimum number required.\n\n### Step 5: Concluding the Minimum Number\nWe have proven that 3 stickers are not enough. The minimum number must be an integer, so it must be at least 4.\nIt can be demonstrated (though it is extremely tedious to show for all 231 pairs of cases) that a carefully chosen set of 4 stickers (e.g., the front and right stickers of the URF corner, the front sticker of the UF edge, and the right sticker of the UR edge) is sufficient to provide a unique signature for every PLL case. Because 3 is insufficient and 4 is sufficient, the minimum number required is 4.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   **PLL Identification:** This involves recognizing the permutation pattern, allowing for rotation of the top layer (AUF).\n*   **The \"Must Be Seen\" clause:** This implies a number that is guaranteed to work in all situations, preventing any possible ambiguity.\n*   **The Na-perm Counterexample:** This is a powerful argument because it shows that a significant part of the last layer (3 adjacent pieces) can be correct while the rest is permuted. Any observation method that looks at a small, localized area can be fooled by this. The observation \"window\" must be large enough to avoid seeing only the \"solved\" part of such a case.\n\nFinal Answer Analysis:\nThe logical proof demonstrates that any system relying on observing only 3 stickers is fallible. Therefore, a minimum of 4 stickers must be observed to ensure 100% accuracy in identifying any PLL case.\n\n<<<4>>>"
