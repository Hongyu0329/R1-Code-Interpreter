    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the statement.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Define SNP Heritability (h²_SNP):**\n    *   SNP heritability is a population-level parameter.\n    *   It represents the proportion of total phenotypic variance that is explained by the additive effects of *all* common SNPs being considered, assuming their *true* effects are known.\n    *   It is a *theoretical upper bound* or ceiling on the amount of variance that can be explained by these SNPs.\n    *   It is often estimated using methods like GREML (Genome-based Restricted Maximum Likelihood), which use the genetic relationships between all individuals in a sample to estimate the total variance explained by the SNPs, without building a predictive model for out-of-sample testing.\n\n2.  **Define a Polygenic Score (PGS) and its Predictive Ability (R²):**\n    *   A polygenic score is a practical tool. It is a single value that summarizes the genetic liability for a trait for a specific individual.\n    *   It is constructed as a weighted sum of an individual's genotypes, where the weights are the *estimated* effect sizes from a Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS).\n    *   Its predictive ability is measured as the proportion of variance explained (R²) when the score is used to predict the phenotype in a *new, independent* test sample. This measures how well the PGS actually performs in practice.\n\n3.  **Compare SNP Heritability and PGS Predictive Ability:**\n    *   **Theoretical Maximum vs. Practical Performance:** SNP heritability (h²_SNP) is the theoretical maximum potential for prediction. The PGS predictive ability (R²) is the actual, achieved prediction in a real-world scenario.\n    *   **True Effects vs. Estimated Effects:** The calculation of SNP heritability conceptually relies on the *true* underlying effect sizes of all SNPs. The calculation of a PGS relies on the *estimated* effect sizes derived from a GWAS of a finite sample size.\n\n4.  **Identify Why PGS Predictive Ability is Lower:**\n    The predictive ability of a PGS is necessarily lower than the SNP heritability because the information used to build it is imperfect. The key reasons for this imperfection are:\n    *   **Finite GWAS Sample Size:** Any GWAS has a finite sample size. This means that the effect size estimates for each SNP are subject to statistical noise and sampling error. They are not the \"true\" effect sizes.\n    *   **Winner's Curse:** When selecting SNPs for a PGS based on statistical significance, the estimated effects for the selected SNPs are often overestimated, which reduces predictive accuracy in a new sample.\n    *   **Imperfect Linkage Disequilibrium (LD) Modeling:** PGS methods must account for the fact that nearby SNPs are correlated (in LD). These models are not perfect, leading to further loss of information.\n    *   **Mismatch in Populations:** If the genetic ancestry of the GWAS discovery sample and the prediction target sample differ, the predictive ability will be further reduced.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe SNP heritability represents the \"perfect world\" scenario where we know the true contribution of all SNPs. A polygenic score is a \"real world\" application built on imperfect estimates from finite data. Because these estimates are not perfect, the resulting PGS cannot capture all the theoretically available genetic variance. Therefore, its predictive ability (R²) must be lower than the SNP heritability (h²_SNP). The gap between R² and h²_SNP shrinks as GWAS sample sizes increase and methods improve, but for any realistic scenario, a gap will always exist.\n\nThe statement is **True**.\n\n<<<True"
