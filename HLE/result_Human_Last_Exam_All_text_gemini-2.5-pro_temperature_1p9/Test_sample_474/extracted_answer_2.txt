No, this approach is not valid. The ecological function of mimicry syndromes in bees is to signal to predators, primarily birds. Avian predators have tetrachromatic vision and can perceive ultraviolet (UV) light, which humans cannot. Two bee species that appear visually similar to a human may have different UV patterns and thus appear distinct to a bird, and vice versa. By using human observers and standard photographs (which don't capture UV), the study fails to measure the warning signal as it is actually perceived by its ecologically relevant audience, making the resulting clusters biologically meaningless in the context of mimicry function.
