    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### **1. Understand the Goal**\n\nThe core of the problem is to find the 4-point Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) of a sequence `y(n)` which is formed by interleaving two 4-point sequences `x(n)` and `h(n)`.\n\n*   The sequence to be transformed is `y(n) = {x(0), h(0), x(1), h(1), x(2), h(2), x(3), h(3)}`. This is an 8-point sequence.\n*   The task is to find a **4-point DFT** of this 8-point sequence. This implies a process of time-domain aliasing (or decimation-in-time).\n*   We are given the 4-point DFTs of `x(n)` and `h(n)`, which are `X(k)` and `H(k)` respectively.\n\n### **2. Time-Domain Aliasing**\n\nTo find the 4-point DFT of an 8-point sequence `y(n)`, we must first create a 4-point sequence, let's call it `z(n)`, by wrapping `y(n)` around and summing the values. This process is called aliasing.\n\nThe formula for `z(n)` is:\n`z(n) = y(n) + y(n + 4)` for `n = 0, 1, 2, 3`.\n\nLet's substitute the values from `y(n) = {x(0), h(0), x(1), h(1), x(2), h(2), x(3), h(3)}`:\n*   `z(0) = y(0) + y(4) = x(0) + x(2)`\n*   `z(1) = y(1) + y(5) = h(0) + h(2)`\n*   `z(2) = y(2) + y(6) = x(1) + x(3)`\n*   `z(3) = y(3) + y(7) = h(1) + h(3)`\n\nThe problem is now reduced to finding the 4-point DFT of this new sequence `z(n)`. To do this, we first need to find the time-domain sequences `x(n)` and `h(n)`.\n\n### **3. Finding x(n) via Inverse DFT**\n\nWe can find `x(n)` by taking the 4-point Inverse DFT (IDFT) of `X(k) = [1, j, -1, -j]`.\nThe formula for the IDFT is:\n`x(n) = (1/N) * Σ [X(k) * W_N^(-nk)]` where `N=4` and `W_4 = e^(-j2π/4) = -j`. Thus, `W_4^(-1) = j`.\n\n*   **For n=0:**\n    `x(0) = (1/4) * [X(0) + X(1) + X(2) + X(3)]`\n    `x(0) = (1/4) * [1 + j + (-1) + (-j)] = (1/4) * 0 = 0`\n\n*   **For n=1:**\n    `x(1) = (1/4) * [X(0)W_4^0 + X(1)W_4^(-1) + X(2)W_4^(-2) + X(3)W_4^(-3)]`\n    `x(1) = (1/4) * [1(1) + j(j) + (-1)(j^2) + (-j)(j^3)] = (1/4) * [1 - 1 + (-1)(-1) + (-j)(-j)] = (1/4) * [0 + 1 - 1] = 0`\n\n*   **For n=2:**\n    `x(2) = (1/4) * [X(0)W_4^0 + X(1)W_4^(-2) + X(2)W_4^(-4) + X(3)W_4^(-6)]`\n    `x(2) = (1/4) * [1(1) + j(j^2) + (-1)(j^4) + (-j)(j^6)] = (1/4) * [1 + j(-1) + (-1)(1) + (-j)(-1)] = (1/4) * [1 - j - 1 + j] = 0`\n\n*   **For n=3:**\n    `x(3) = (1/4) * [X(0)W_4^0 + X(1)W_4^(-3) + X(2)W_4^(-6) + X(3)W_4^(-9)]`\n    `x(3) = (1/4) * [1(1) + j(j^3) + (-1)(j^6) + (-j)(j^9)] = (1/4) * [1 + j(-j) + (-1)(-1) + (-j)(j)] = (1/4) * [1 + 1 + 1 + 1] = 1`\n\nSo, the sequence `x(n)` is **`[0, 0, 0, 1]`**.\n\n### **4. Finding h(n) via Inverse DFT**\n\nNext, we find `h(n)` by taking the 4-point IDFT of `H(k) = [0, 1+j, 1, 1-j]`.\n\n*   **For n=0:**\n    `h(0) = (1/4) * [H(0) + H(1) + H(2) + H(3)]`\n    `h(0) = (1/4) * [0 + (1+j) + 1 + (1-j)] = (1/4) * 3 = 3/4`\n\n*   **For n=1:**\n    `h(1) = (1/4) * [H(0)W_4^0 + H(1)W_4^(-1) + H(2)W_4^(-2) + H(3)W_4^(-3)]`\n    `h(1) = (1/4) * [0(1) + (1+j)(j) + 1(j^2) + (1-j)(j^3)] = (1/4) * [j-1 -1 -j-1] = -3/4`\n\n*   **For n=2:**\n    `h(2) = (1/4) * [H(0)W_4^0 + H(1)W_4^(-2) + H(2)W_4^(-4) + H(3)W_4^(-6)]`\n    `h(2) = (1/4) * [0(1) + (1+j)(j^2) + 1(j^4) + (1-j)(j^6)] = (1/4) * [-1-j + 1 -1+j] = -1/4`\n\n*   **For n=3:**\n    `h(3) = (1/4) * [H(0)W_4^0 + H(1)W_4^(-3) + H(2)W_4^(-6) + H(3)W_4^(-9)]`\n    `h(3) = (1/4) * [0(1) + (1+j)(j^3) + 1(j^6) + (1-j)(j^9)] = (1/4) * [-j+1 -1 +j+1] = 1/4`\n\nSo, the sequence `h(n)` is **`[3/4, -3/4, -1/4, 1/4]`**.\n\n### **5. Constructing the Sequence z(n)**\n\nNow we construct the aliased sequence `z(n)` using the values of `x(n)` and `h(n)`.\n*   `z(0) = x(0) + x(2) = 0 + 0 = 0`\n*   `z(1) = h(0) + h(2) = 3/4 + (-1/4) = 2/4 = 1/2`\n*   `z(2) = x(1) + x(3) = 0 + 1 = 1`\n*   `z(3) = h(1) + h(3) = -3/4 + 1/4 = -2/4 = -1/2`\n\nSo, the sequence `z(n)` to be transformed is **`[0, 1/2, 1, -1/2]`**.\n\n### **6. Finding the 4-point DFT of z(n)**\n\nFinally, we compute the 4-point DFT of `z(n)`, which we'll call `Z(k)`.\nThe formula for the DFT is:\n`Z(k) = Σ [z(n) * W_N^(nk)]` where `N=4` and `W_4 = -j`.\n\n*   **For k=0:**\n    `Z(0) = z(0) + z(1) + z(2) + z(3)`\n    `Z(0) = 0 + 1/2 + 1 - 1/2 = 1`\n\n*   **For k=1:**\n    `Z(1) = z(0)W_4^0 + z(1)W_4^1 + z(2)W_4^2 + z(3)W_4^3`\n    `Z(1) = 0(1) + (1/2)(-j) + 1(-1) + (-1/2)(j)`\n    `Z(1) = -j/2 - 1 - j/2 = -1 - j`\n\n*   **For k=2:**\n    `Z(2) = z(0)W_4^0 + z(1)W_4^2 + z(2)W_4^4 + z(3)W_4^6`\n    `Z(2) = 0(1) + (1/2)(-1) + 1(1) + (-1/2)(-1)`\n    `Z(2) = -1/2 + 1 + 1/2 = 1`\n\n*   **For k=3:**\n    `Z(3) = z(0)W_4^0 + z(1)W_4^3 + z(2)W_4^6 + z(3)W_4^9`\n    `Z(3) = 0(1) + (1/2)(j) + 1(-1) + (-1/2)(-j)`\n    `Z(3) = j/2 - 1 + j/2 = -1 + j`\n\nThe final 4-point DFT is the sequence `[Z(0), Z(1), Z(2), Z(3)]`.\n\nFinal Answer: `[1, -1-j, 1, -1+j]`\n\n<<<[1, -1-j, 1, -1+j]>>>"
