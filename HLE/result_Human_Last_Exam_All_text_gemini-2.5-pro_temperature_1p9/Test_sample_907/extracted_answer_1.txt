**a) No interaction between molecules:**
The absorption cross-section, as a function of the laser central frequency $\omega_L$, is given by:
$\sigma_a(\omega_L) = \frac{2\sqrt{\pi}\tau \omega_{eg}}{c\epsilon_0 \hbar} N |\vec{\mu}_{eg} \cdot \vec{\epsilon}|^2 e^{-(\omega_{eg} - \omega_L)^2 \tau^2}$
Where:
- $N$ is the number of molecules in the chain.
- $\tau$ is the duration of the Gaussian laser pulse.
- $\omega_{eg}$ is the electronic transition frequency of a single molecule.
- $\vec{\mu}_{eg}$ is the transition dipole moment of a single molecule.
- $\vec{\epsilon}$ is the laser field polarization vector.
- $c, \epsilon_0, \hbar$ are the speed of light, vacuum permittivity, and reduced Planck's constant.

**b) Nearest-neighbor interaction considered:**
The absorption cross-section is given by the transition to the bright $k=0$ Frenkel exciton state:
$\sigma_b(\omega_L) = \frac{2\sqrt{\pi}\tau \omega_{k=0}}{c\epsilon_0 \hbar} N |\vec{\mu}_{eg} \cdot \vec{\epsilon}|^2 e^{-(\omega_{k=0} - \omega_L)^2 \tau^2}$
Where the parameters are the same as above, with the key di
