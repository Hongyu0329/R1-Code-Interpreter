    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode with an infinite number of players, according to the Terraria source code.\n\n### Step 1: Identify Base Health in Expert Mode\nFirst, we need the base health value for the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode for a single player. This value serves as the starting point for multiplayer scaling.\n*   **Normal Mode Base Health:** 2800 HP\n*   **Expert Mode Base Health (1 Player):** 3640 HP\n\nWe will use 3640 HP as the base for our multiplayer calculation.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Health Scaling Formula\nIn Terraria's Expert Mode, the health of bosses increases for each additional player in the world. The formula used for this scaling, as derived from the game's source code, is as follows:\n\n`Total Health = BaseExpertHealth * (1 + 0.35 * (NumberOfPlayers - 1))`\n\nWhere:\n*   `BaseExpertHealth` is the boss's health for one player in Expert Mode (3640 for the Eye of Cthulhu).\n*   `NumberOfPlayers` is the number of active players (`N`).\n*   `0.35` is the additional health multiplier (35%) applied for each player beyond the first.\n\nLet's simplify this formula:\n`Total Health(N) = 3640 * (1 + 0.35N - 0.35)`\n`Total Health(N) = 3640 * (0.65 + 0.35N)`\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Formula for an Infinite Number of Players\nThe question asks for the theoretical maximum health given an infinite number of players. Mathematically, this means we need to find the limit of the `Total Health(N)` function as `N` approaches infinity (∞).\n\n`lim (N -> ∞) [3640 * (0.65 + 0.35N)]`\n\nAs `N` becomes infinitely large, the term `0.35N` also becomes infinitely large. The constant `0.65` becomes insignificant in comparison. Therefore, the entire expression inside the parentheses trends towards infinity. When multiplied by 3640, the result is still infinity.\n\nMathematically, the health would be infinite.\n\n### Step 4: Consider the Technical Limitations of the Game Engine\nThis is the most critical step. While the mathematical formula has no upper bound, the game itself is a piece of software with technical limitations. The health of any Non-Player Character (NPC) in Terraria is stored in a variable. By examining the source code, we find that NPC health (`life` and `lifeMax` properties) is stored as a 32-bit signed integer (`int`).\n\nA 32-bit signed integer has a specific maximum value it can represent. Any number larger than this will either be clamped to this maximum value or cause an \"integer overflow,\" which can lead to crashes or unexpected behavior (like the number wrapping around to be negative). Modern C# conventions, used by Terraria's engine, clamp floating-point numbers to the integer's maximum value upon casting to prevent overflow.\n\nThe maximum value for a 32-bit signed integer is **2,147,483,647**.\n\n### Step 5: Final Conclusion\nBecause the game engine cannot store a health value greater than the maximum value of a 32-bit signed integer, the scaling of the Eye of Cthulhu's health is effectively capped at this number. No matter how many more players are added beyond the point where this cap is reached (which would require approximately 1.7 million players), the health cannot increase further.\n\nTherefore, the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu is limited by its data type in the source code.\n\n<<<2147483647>>>"
