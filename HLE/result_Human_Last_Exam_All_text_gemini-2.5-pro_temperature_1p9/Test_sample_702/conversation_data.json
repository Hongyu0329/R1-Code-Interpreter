    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the connectivity of the map $f: \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Spaces and the Map**\n\n*   **Spaces:** The source space is the suspension of the smash product of the loop spaces of $S^4$ and $S^6$. The target space is the loop space of the smash product of $S^4$ and $S^6$.\n*   **Simplification:** We use the standard homotopy equivalences:\n    *   $\\Omega X$ denotes the based loop space of $X$.\n    *   $\\Sigma X$ denotes the reduced suspension of $X$.\n    *   $S^p \\wedge S^q \\simeq S^{p+q}$.\n    *   Thus, the target space $\\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$ is homotopy equivalent to $\\Omega S^{10}$.\n*   **The Map:** The map $f: \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega S^{10}$ is a well-known map in homotopy theory, often referred to as a generalized Samelson product or a James-Hopf invariant. The phrase \"induced by a map of homotopy fibers\" alludes to its construction from the path space fibrations $\\Omega S^n \\to * \\to S^n$.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Connectivity of the Source and Target Spaces**\n\n*   **Connectivity of a space:** A space $X$ is $k$-connected if its homotopy groups $\\pi_i(X)$ are trivial for all $i \\le k$.\n*   **Connectivity of Loop Spaces:** The loop space functor $\\Omega$ decreases connectivity by 1. Since $S^n$ is $(n-1)$-connected, $\\Omega S^n$ is $(n-2)$-connected.\n    *   $\\Omega S^4$ is $(4-2) = 2$-connected.\n    *   $\\Omega S^6$ is $(6-2) = 4$-connected.\n*   **Connectivity of Smash Products:** If $X$ is $k$-connected and $Y$ is $l$-connected, their smash product $X \\wedge Y$ is $(k+l+1)$-connected.\n    *   The space $\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6$ is $(2+4+1) = 7$-connected.\n*   **Connectivity of Suspensions:** The suspension functor $\\Sigma$ increases connectivity by 1.\n    *   The source space, $\\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$, is $(7+1) = 8$-connected.\n*   **Connectivity of the Target Space:** The target space $\\Omega S^{10}$ is $(10-2) = 8$-connected.\n*   **Conclusion:** Both the source and target spaces are 8-connected. This means the map $f$ induces isomorphisms on $\\pi_i$ for $i < 9$ (since all these groups are trivial). The connectivity of the map is therefore at least 9.\n\n**Step 3: Apply the Relevant Theorem on the Connectivity of the Map**\n\nTo determine the precise connectivity, we must analyze the map $f$ on non-trivial homotopy groups (for $i \\ge 9$). This requires deep results from homotopy theory, as simple calculations using the Hurewicz theorem can be misleading beyond the first non-trivial homotopy group.\n\nThe map in question is a standard construction whose connectivity is known. There is a homotopy equivalence (due to Sugawara) $\\Sigma(\\Omega X \\wedge \\Omega Y) \\simeq \\Omega X * \\Omega Y$, where $*$ denotes the join. So we can analyze the connectivity of the map $h: \\Omega S^4 * \\Omega S^6 \\to \\Omega S^{10}$.\n\nA classical result, stated in Toda's \"Composition Methods in Homotopy Theory\" (Theorem 11.13), describes the homotopy fiber of the map $h: \\Omega S^p * \\Omega S^q \\to \\Omega S^{p+q}$.\n*   **Toda's Theorem:** For $p, q \\ge 2$, the homotopy fiber of the map $h: \\Omega S^p * \\Omega S^q \\to \\Omega S^{p+q}$ has the homotopy type of a CW-complex with cells only in dimensions $d \\ge \\min(2p+q-1, p+2q-1)$.\n*   This means the homotopy fiber is $(\\min(2p+q-1, p+2q-1)-1)$-connected.\n*   **Definition of Map Connectivity:** A map $f$ is $k$-connected if its homotopy fiber $F_f$ is $(k-1)$-connected. This is equivalent to $f_*:\\pi_i(X) \\to \\pi_i(Y)$ being an isomorphism for $i<k$ and a surjection for $i=k$.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Connectivity**\n\nLet's apply Toda's theorem to our case with $p=4$ and $q=6$.\n\n1.  Calculate the dimension bound from the theorem:\n    *   $2p+q-1 = 2(4)+6-1 = 8+6-1 = 13$.\n    *   $p+2q-1 = 4+2(6)-1 = 4+12-1 = 15$.\n2.  Find the minimum of these values:\n    *   $\\min(13, 15) = 13$.\n3.  Determine the connectivity of the fiber:\n    *   The fiber has cells only in dimensions $d \\ge 13$.\n    *   Therefore, the fiber is $(13-1) = 12$-connected.\n4.  Determine the connectivity of the map:\n    *   Since the fiber is 12-connected, the map itself is $(12+1) = 13$-connected.\n\n**Final Answer Summary:**\n\n*   The map is $f: \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6) \\simeq \\Omega S^{10}$.\n*   Both source and target spaces are 8-connected.\n*   A key theorem by Toda establishes that the homotopy fiber of this map is 12-connected.\n*   This implies that the map is 13-connected, meaning it induces isomorphisms on homotopy groups $\\pi_i$ for $i < 13$ and a surjection for $i = 13$.\n\n<<<13>>>"
