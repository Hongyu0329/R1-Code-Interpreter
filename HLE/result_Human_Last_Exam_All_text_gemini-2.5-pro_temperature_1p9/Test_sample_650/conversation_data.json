    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the algorithm's computational time complexity.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the basic operations:** The algorithm consists of assignments (`:=`), arithmetic operations (division `/`, multiplication `*`, subtraction `-`, addition `+`), and comparisons (`>`). In a standard model of computation (like the RAM model), we assume these basic operations on integers that fit within a machine's word size take constant time, denoted as O(1).\n\n2.  **Analyze the code outside the loop (Initialization and Return):**\n    *   **Step 1:** `i := 0; x := n; q := ⌊x/c⌋; a_{0} := x — qc;`\n        *   This step involves four basic operations: one assignment for `i`, one for `x`, one division and assignment for `q`, and one multiplication, one subtraction, and one assignment for `a_0`.\n        *   Each of these operations takes constant time, O(1).\n        *   Therefore, the total time for Step 1 is O(1).\n    *   **Step 3:** `return ($(a_{i}a_{i - 1}, …, a_{1}  a_{0})$)`\n        *   This step returns the computed representation. The time to construct and return the result depends on the number of digits, which we will determine by analyzing the loop. However, even if it takes time proportional to the number of digits, it won't be larger than the complexity of the loop that generates those digits. For simplicity, we can consider the return of a reference to be O(1), or acknowledge its cost will be dominated by the loop's cost.\n\n3.  **Analyze the `while` loop:**\n    *   The complexity of the algorithm is dominated by the `while` loop. To find its complexity, we need to determine two things:\n        a. How many times the loop iterates.\n        b. How much work is done in each iteration.\n\n    *   **b. Work per iteration:**\n        *   Inside the loop (Step 2.1), we have the following operations:\n            *   `i := i + 1`: one increment (O(1)).\n            *   `x := q`: one assignment (O(1)).\n            *   `q :=. ⌊x/c⌋`: one division (O(1)).\n            *   `a_{i} := x — qc`: one multiplication, one subtraction, one assignment (O(1)).\n        *   The total work inside each iteration is a sum of a constant number of O(1) operations. Thus, the time complexity of a single iteration is O(1).\n\n    *   **a. Number of iterations:**\n        *   The loop continues as long as `q > 0`. The value of `q` is updated in each iteration.\n        *   Let's trace the value of `q`. Before the loop, `q` is initialized to `q_0 = ⌊n/c⌋`.\n        *   In the first iteration, `x` becomes `q_0`, and the new `q` becomes `q_1 = ⌊x/c⌋ = ⌊(⌊n/c⌋)/c⌋`. This is equivalent to `⌊n/c²⌋`.\n        *   In the second iteration, `q` becomes `q_2 = ⌊q_1/c⌋ = ⌊(⌊n/c²⌋)/c⌋ = ⌊n/c³⌋`.\n        *   After `k` iterations of the loop, the value of `q` will be `q_k = ⌊n/c^(k+1)⌋`.\n        *   The loop terminates when `q` becomes 0. This happens when `⌊n/c^(k+1)⌋ = 0`, which is true if `n/c^(k+1) < 1`, or `n < c^(k+1)`.\n        *   Taking the base-`c` logarithm of both sides gives `log_c(n) < k+1`, which means `k > log_c(n) - 1`.\n        *   So, the number of iterations `k` is the smallest integer greater than `log_c(n) - 1`. This means `k` is approximately `log_c(n)`. More precisely, the number of iterations is `⌊log_c n⌋` (for `n ≥ c`).\n        *   Therefore, the number of iterations is proportional to `log_c n`. We can say the number of iterations is `O(log_c n)`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Total Complexity:**\n    *   The total time complexity is the sum of the complexities of the parts:\n        *   `T(n, c) = (Time for Step 1) + (Number of Iterations) * (Time per Iteration) + (Time for Step 3)`\n        *   `T(n, c) = O(1) + O(log_c n) * O(1) + O(1)`\n        *   `T(n, c) = O(1) + O(log_c n) + O(1)`\n        *   `T(n, c) = O(log_c n)`\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Assumption on Arithmetic:** The primary assumption is that arithmetic operations like division and multiplication are O(1). This holds true for numbers that fit into a computer's native word size. If `n` is an arbitrarily large number (requiring bignum arithmetic), the cost of these operations would depend on the number of bits in `n` (which is `O(log n)`), and the analysis would be more complex, likely leading to `O((log n)²)`. However, for a standard analysis, the O(1) assumption is conventional.\n*   **Base of Logarithm:** The complexity depends on the base `c`. It is important to write `log_c n`. While in big-O notation `O(log_c n)` is equivalent to `O(log n)` for any constant base `c > 1` (since `log_c n = log n / log c`, and `1/log c` is a constant factor), writing `log_c n` is more precise as it shows the dependency on `c`.\n*   **Edge Cases:** The algorithm behaves correctly for small `n` (e.g., `n < c`). In this case, `q` is 0 initially, the loop does not run, and the complexity is O(1). The formula `O(log_c n)` is consistent with this, as `log_c n` is a small constant for small `n`.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nBased on the analysis, the algorithm's runtime is dominated by the `while` loop. The loop runs a number of times proportional to the number of digits in the base `c` representation of `n`, which is `O(log_c n)`. Each iteration of the loop performs a constant amount of work. Thus, the total computational time complexity is `O(log_c n)`.\n\n<<<O(log_c n)>>>"
