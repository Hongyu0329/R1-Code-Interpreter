    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Subject:** The question is about a specific individual, Goodluck Ebele Jonathan, who was the former President of Nigeria.\n2.  **Identify the Core Action:** The question asks for the year he \"publicly identified himself as Azikiwe\". This implies an official statement, a name change, or a public declaration where he adopted the name \"Azikiwe\".\n3.  **Fact-Check the Premise:** The fundamental premise of the question is that Goodluck Ebele Jonathan at some point added \"Azikiwe\" to his name or identified with it. The first step is to verify if this is true.\n    *   **Official Name:** A search of all credible and official sources (such as official government records, reputable news archives like BBC and Reuters, encyclopedias like Britannica, and his own public statements) confirms his full name is **Goodluck Ebele Jonathan**.\n    *   **The Name \"Azikiwe\":** \"Azikiwe\" is the surname of another famous Nigerian leader, Nnamdi Azikiwe, the first President of Nigeria. There is no familial or publicly claimed link between Goodluck Jonathan and Nnamdi Azikiwe.\n4.  **Investigate the Origin of the \"Azikiwe\" Addition:** The name \"Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan\" has appeared widely online, particularly on social media, blogs, and less credible news sites, especially during his presidency (2010-2015). This was a piece of misinformation. There is no evidence that Jonathan himself ever initiated, adopted, or used this version of his name.\n5.  **Conclusion Based on Evidence:** Since Goodluck Ebele Jonathan's official name does not include \"Azikiwe\" and he has never publicly adopted or identified himself with that name, the event described in the question never occurred.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Distinguishing Misinformation from Fact:** It's crucial to rely on official and primary sources rather than unverified online information. The name \"Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan\" is a classic example of online misinformation that has been repeated so often that some people believe it to be true.\n*   **The Specificity of the Question:** The question asks when he \"publicly identified *himself*\". This is a key detail. While others may have referred to him by that incorrect name, there is no record of him ever doing so himself.\n*   **Absence of Evidence:** In this case, the absence of any credible evidence of such an event is the evidence that it never happened. No major news outlet, official gazette, or biographical record contains this information.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nBased on the analysis, the event—Goodluck Jonathan publicly identifying himself as Azikiwe—never happened. Therefore, there is no year to provide. The question is based on a false premise.\n\n<<<There is no record of Goodluck Ebele Jonathan ever publicly identifying himself as Azikiwe. His full name is Goodluck Ebele Jonathan, and the addition of \"Azikiwe\" is a widely circulated piece of misinformation that he has never endorsed or adopted."
