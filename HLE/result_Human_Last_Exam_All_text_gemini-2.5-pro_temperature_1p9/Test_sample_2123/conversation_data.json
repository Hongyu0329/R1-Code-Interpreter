    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to arrive at the final answer.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Subject:** An essay.\n    *   **Context:** Its Russian translation.\n    *   **Setting:** Description of the wide boulevards of Vienna.\n    *   **The Core Clue:** The surname of an English poet appears in this description.\n    *   **Objective:** Identify this surname in English.\n\n2.  **Identify Careful Points and Key Inferences:**\n    *   The mention of a \"Russian translation\" is a significant hint. It suggests the author might be Russian or has a strong connection to Russian literature, and that the wordplay or reference might be specific to or highlighted in that version.\n    *   \"Wide boulevards of Vienna\" strongly points to the Ringstrasse, the grand circular boulevard that replaced the old city walls. A common observation about these boulevards is their monumental scale, which can make them feel somewhat empty or vast, especially after the fall of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.\n    *   The appearance of a poet's surname is unlikely to be a simple statement of fact (e.g., \"a statue of poet X is here\"). It is more likely to be part of a literary device, such as a pun or a clever comparison.\n    *   We need to find an intersection between a specific essay about Vienna, the Russian language, and the name of an English poet that could be used in a pun related to \"wide\" or \"empty\" spaces.\n\n3.  **Connecting the Clues to Find the Source:**\n    *   The combination of a sophisticated literary essay, Vienna, and deep references to English poetry strongly points to the work of the Russian-American Nobel laureate Joseph Brodsky.\n    *   Brodsky wrote a famous essay about Vienna titled \"A Guide to a Renamed City\" (\"Путеводитель по переименованному городу\" in its Russian translation).\n    *   In this essay, Brodsky reflects on the city's past imperial grandeur and its present state. He describes the vast, empty feel of its architecture and open spaces.\n\n4.  **Solving the Pun:**\n    *   When describing the monumental, vacant feel of Vienna's boulevards and squares, Brodsky uses the German word for \"empty,\" which is **\"leer.\"** The use of a German word is natural given the setting is Vienna.\n    *   This word, \"leer,\" sounds exactly like the surname of an English poet and artist.\n    *   The English poet with this surname is **Edward Lear**, who was famous for his literary nonsense and limericks.\n    *   In the essay, Brodsky explicitly makes this pun, connecting the \"leer\" (empty) quality of the Viennese landscape to the name \"Lear,\" simultaneously referencing both the poet Edward Lear and Shakespeare's *King Lear*. The question asks for the surname of a poet, making Edward Lear the precise answer.\n\n5.  **Final Confirmation:**\n    *   All conditions of the question are met:\n        *   **Essay:** Joseph Brodsky's \"A Guide to a Renamed City.\"\n        *   **Russian translation:** The pun is preserved and understood in the Russian context.\n        *   **Location:** The wide boulevards of Vienna.\n        *   **Clue:** A pun on the German word for \"empty\" (\"leer\") reveals the poet's surname.\n        *   **Surname:** Lear.\n\n<<<Lear>>>"
