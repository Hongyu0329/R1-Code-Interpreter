    "This problem asks for `a(3)`, where `a(n)` is the number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams of order `2n` for the electron or the photon propagators in Quantum Electrodynamics (QED).\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to arrive at the solution:\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the question\n\n*   **`a(n)`**: A function representing the number of a specific class of Feynman diagrams.\n*   **Order `2n`**: In QED, the order of a diagram in the perturbative expansion is half the number of its vertices. So, order `2n` corresponds to `2n` vertices.\n*   **Electron or the photon propagators**: This refers to self-energy diagrams (for the electron) or vacuum polarization diagrams (for the photon). The use of \"or\" implies that the number `a(n)` is the same for both cases, which is a known property in QED. We can focus on the electron self-energy case, as it's often easier to visualize and count.\n*   **Non-vanishing diagrams**: In this context, this typically means topologically distinct, connected, and one-particle irreducible (1PI) diagrams. A diagram is 1PI if it cannot be separated into two disconnected pieces by cutting a single internal line.\n*   **Goal**: We need to find the value of `a(3)`, which corresponds to diagrams of order `2 * 3 = 6`, meaning diagrams with 6 vertices.\n\n### Step 2: Modeling the problem for electron self-energy\n\nAn electron self-energy diagram represents corrections to the electron propagator. It consists of an incoming electron line, an outgoing electron line, and a \"blob\" in between where interactions happen. For an order `2n` diagram, this blob contains `2n` vertices.\n\nIn QED, each vertex connects two electron lines and one photon line. In a self-energy diagram, the `2n` vertices can be thought of as lying on a single main electron path. From each of these `2n` vertices, a photon line originates. To form internal propagators, these `2n` photon connection points must be paired up, forming `n` internal photon lines.\n\nThis simplifies the problem to a combinatorial one:\n*   We have `2n` points arranged on a line (representing the vertices on the electron path).\n*   We need to connect these points in pairs with `n` arcs (representing the photons).\n*   The diagrams must be 1PI.\n\n### Step 3: Total number of diagrams (reducible and irreducible)\n\nLet's first find the total number of ways to connect `2n` vertices with `n` photon lines, without considering the 1PI condition. This is equivalent to the number of ways to partition a set of `2n` items into `n` pairs. This quantity is given by the double factorial `(2n-1)!!`.\n\n`T(n) = (2n-1)!! = (2n-1) * (2n-3) * ... * 3 * 1`\n\n*   For `n=1` (2 vertices): `T(1) = (2*1 - 1)!! = 1!! = 1`. There is only one way to connect two vertices.\n*   For `n=2` (4 vertices): `T(2) = (2*2 - 1)!! = 3!! = 3 * 1 = 3`.\n*   For `n=3` (6 vertices): `T(3) = (2*3 - 1)!! = 5!! = 5 * 3 * 1 = 15`.\n\n### Step 4: Applying the 1PI (irreducible) condition using a recurrence relation\n\nA diagram is reducible if it can be separated into two or more smaller self-energy diagrams by cutting the electron line. This means that a contiguous block of vertices `{k, k+1, ..., l}` on the electron path is connected by photons only among themselves, and is isolated from the rest.\n\nAny diagram can be uniquely decomposed as a sequence of 1PI diagrams. Let `a(n)` be the number of 1PI diagrams of order `2n`.\nThe total number of diagrams `T(n)` can be expressed as a sum over the possible sizes of the first 1PI component. If the first 1PI component has `2k` vertices (order `2k`), there are `a(k)` ways to form it. The remaining `2(n-k)` vertices can form any diagram, giving `T(n-k)` possibilities.\n\nThis leads to the recurrence relation:\n`T(n) = a(1)T(n-1) + a(2)T(n-2) + ... + a(n)T(0)`\nor `T(n) = Î£_{k=1 to n} a(k)T(n-k)`\nwhere we define `T(0) = 1`.\n\n### Step 5: Calculating a(3)\n\nWe can now use the recurrence relation to find `a(n)` step-by-step.\n\n1.  **For n=1 (2 vertices):**\n    `T(1) = a(1)T(0)`\n    `1 = a(1) * 1`\n    `a(1) = 1`\n\n2.  **For n=2 (4 vertices):**\n    `T(2) = a(1)T(1) + a(2)T(0)`\n    We know `T(2)=3`, `a(1)=1`, `T(1)=1`, and `T(0)=1`.\n    `3 = (1)*(1) + a(2)*(1)`\n    `3 = 1 + a(2)`\n    `a(2) = 2`\n\n3.  **For n=3 (6 vertices):**\n    `T(3) = a(1)T(2) + a(2)T(1) + a(3)T(0)`\n    We know `T(3)=15`, `a(1)=1`, `T(2)=3`, `a(2)=2`, `T(1)=1`, and `T(0)=1`.\n    `15 = (1)*(3) + (2)*(1) + a(3)*(1)`\n    `15 = 3 + 2 + a(3)`\n    `15 = 5 + a(3)`\n    `a(3) = 10`\n\nThus, there are 10 non-vanishing (1PI) Feynman diagrams of order 6."
