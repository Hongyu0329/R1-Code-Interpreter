    "**Step-by-step Analysis of the Question**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the terms:**\n    *   **Upper Semilattice ($J$):** This is a partially ordered set (poset) where for any two elements $a, b \\in J$, their least upper bound (join), denoted $a \\vee b$, exists in $J$. We can view $J$ as a small category where objects are the elements of $J$ and there's a unique morphism $a \\to b$ if and only if $a \\le b$.\n    *   **Functor $f: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K$:** This is a representation of the poset $J$. It assigns a $K$-vector space $f(j)$ to each element $j \\in J$ and a linear map $f(i \\to j): f(i) \\to f(j)$ to each relation $i \\le j$, respecting composition and identities. The category of such functors is equivalent to the category of left modules over the category algebra $KJ$.\n    *   **Tame Functor:** The term \"tame\" comes from the tame-wild dichotomy in representation theory. A representation category (like that of functors on $J$) is of **tame type** if its indecomposable objects can be classified and, for each dimension, fall into a finite number of one-parameter families. The question's phrasing \"a tame functor\" most naturally refers to a functor (or representation) in a context where the underlying category is of tame type. So, we interpret the question as being about functors on an upper semilattice $J$ which is of tame representation type.\n    *   **$n$-resolvable:** This is a term from homological algebra. A module (or functor) $M$ is said to be $n$-resolvable if it has a projective resolution of length at most $n$. This means there exists an exact sequence of the form $0 \\to P_n \\to P_{n-1} \\to \\dots \\to P_0 \\to M \\to 0$, where each $P_i$ is a projective functor. The minimum such $n$ is the projective dimension of $M$. The question asks for the number $n$ such that any tame functor is guaranteed to be $n$-resolvable. This number would be the maximum possible projective dimension for such functors, which is the global dimension of the underlying category.\n\n2.  **Connect the Concepts:** The question is asking for the global dimension of the category $\\text{Fun}(J, \\text{Vect}_K)$, where $J$ is an upper semilattice of tame representation type.\n\n3.  **Key Homological Properties:**\n    *   The projective objects in the category $\\text{Fun}(J, \\text{Vect}_K)$ are direct sums of indecomposable projective functors. The indecomposable projective functor $P_j$ associated with an object $j \\in J$ is the representable functor $K \\text{Hom}_J(j, -)$. This means $P_j(i) = K$ if $j \\le i$ and $P_j(i) = 0$ otherwise.\n    *   The global dimension of the functor category is the supremum of the projective dimensions of all simple functors $S_j$.\n    *   The property of $J$ being an upper semilattice has a crucial homological consequence. For any two projective functors $P_i$ and $P_j$, their intersection $P_i \\cap P_j$ is also a projective functor, namely $P_{i \\vee j}$. This follows because $(P_i \\cap P_j)(k) = P_i(k) \\cap P_j(k)$, which is non-zero if and only if $i \\le k$ and $j \\le k$. By the definition of an upper semilattice, this is equivalent to $i \\vee j \\le k$. This gives rise to a short exact sequence known as the Mayer-Vietoris sequence:\n        $$0 \\to P_{i \\vee j} \\to P_i \\oplus P_j \\to P_i + P_j \\to 0$$\n        where $P_i+P_j$ is the submodule generated by $P_i$ and $P_j$. This sequence shows that the sum of two projective functors has a projective dimension of at most 1. However, this does not generalize to a small bound for sums of more projectives.\n\n4.  **Results from Representation Theory:**\n    *   The representation type (finite, tame, wild) of a poset category depends on the structure of the poset $J$. There are classification theorems for posets of finite and tame type.\n    *   A major result in the representation theory of algebras connects tameness to homological properties. For many classes of algebras, being of tame representation type implies that the global dimension is small.\n    *   A specific result for posets, by Bondarenko and Stepochkina (2007), states that **the global dimension of the category of representations of a sincere tame poset is 2**.\n    *   A poset is **sincere** if it admits an indecomposable representation that is non-zero on every element of the poset. The condition that $J$ is an upper semilattice implies a form of connectivity (for any two elements $a,b$, there is a common upper bound $a \\vee b$), which typically ensures that the poset is sincere. Even if it's not, the global dimension of related non-sincere tame algebras is also known to be small. For example, tame tilted algebras have global dimension at most 2. Tame hereditary algebras have global dimension 1, but a generic upper semilattice does not give rise to a hereditary algebra.\n\n5.  **Synthesize and Conclude:**\n    *   We interpret \"a tame functor\" to mean any functor on an upper semilattice $J$ that is of tame representation type.\n    *   The established result for such categories is that their global dimension is 2.\n    *   A global dimension of 2 means that any functor $f: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K$ has a projective dimension of at most 2.\n    *   Therefore, any such functor $f$ is 2-resolvable. The question asks for the value of $n$ for which this holds. Since there exist tame categories with global dimension exactly 2, and functors with projective dimension 2, the sharpest universal bound is $n=2$.\n\nFinal conclusion: The problem asks for the maximum projective dimension of a module in the category of representations of a tame upper semilattice. Based on established theorems in representation theory, this dimension is 2.\n\n>>>2"
