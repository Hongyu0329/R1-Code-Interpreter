    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of let-7 family members in humans.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The user wants to know the total number of \"members\" of the \"let-7 family\" of microRNAs that have been identified in \"humans\" to date.\n\n2.  **Identify the Ambiguity (A Careful Point):** The term \"member\" can be interpreted in two primary ways in the context of miRNA families:\n    *   **Distinct Mature miRNA Sequences:** Counting each unique mature miRNA sequence as one member.\n    *   **Distinct Precursor Genes (loci):** Counting each individual gene that encodes a let-7 family miRNA as one member. Since some distinct genes can produce identical or nearly identical mature miRNAs, these two counting methods can yield different numbers. In genomics and molecular biology literature, it is very common to refer to the number of genes when discussing the size of a family.\n\n3.  **Identify the Core let-7 Family:** The canonical let-7 family in humans is widely accepted to consist of miRNAs named `let-7` and the closely related `miR-98`. This includes:\n    *   let-7a\n    *   let-7b\n    *   let-7c\n    *   let-7d\n    *   let-7e\n    *   let-7f\n    *   let-7g\n    *   let-7i\n    *   miR-98\n\n4.  **Analyze Based on \"Distinct Mature miRNA Sequences\":** If we count the number of unique mature miRNA sequences produced by the core family members listed above, we find that `let-7a`, `let-7b`, `let-7c`, `let-7d`, `let-7e`, `let-7f`, `let-7g`, `let-7i`, and `miR-98` all have distinct mature sequences (though they are highly similar, often differing by only 1-2 nucleotides). This interpretation would lead to an answer of **9 members**.\n\n5.  **Analyze Based on \"Distinct Precursor Genes\" (The Standard Method):** This method counts the number of distinct gene locations (loci) in the human genome that encode for let-7 miRNAs. This is the more common and scientifically precise way to count family members, as each gene is a separate unit of transcription and regulation. Using the primary microRNA database, miRBase, we can count the precursor genes:\n    *   **let-7a:** is encoded by *three* distinct genes (paralogs): `hsa-let-7a-1`, `hsa-let-7a-2`, and `hsa-let-7a-3`.\n    *   **let-7f:** is encoded by *two* distinct genes: `hsa-let-7f-1` and `hsa-let-7f-2`.\n    *   **let-7b:** is encoded by *one* gene: `hsa-let-7b`.\n    *   **let-7c:** is encoded by *one* gene: `hsa-let-7c`.\n    *   **let-7d:** is encoded by *one* gene: `hsa-let-7d`.\n    *   **let-7e:** is encoded by *one* gene: `hsa-let-7e`.\n    *   **let-7g:** is encoded by *one* gene: `hsa-let-7g`.\n    *   **let-7i:** is encoded by *one* gene: `hsa-let-7i`.\n    *   **miR-98:** is encoded by *one* gene: `hsa-miR-98`.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Total Number of Genes:**\n    Summing the number of genes from Step 5:\n    3 (from let-7a) + 2 (from let-7f) + 1 (from let-7b) + 1 (from let-7c) + 1 (from let-7d) + 1 (from let-7e) + 1 (from let-7g) + 1 (from let-7i) + 1 (from miR-98) = **12**\n\n7.  **Final Conclusion:** Based on counting the distinct precursor genes, which is the standard convention in the scientific community for defining the size of a miRNA family, the human let-7 family consists of 12 members. This number is widely cited in review articles and research papers on the topic.\n\n<<<12>>>"
