    "To find the number of 2-vertex-connected simple nonisomorphic graphs with 5 vertices, we will analyze the possible number of edges (`m`) for such a graph.\n\n### Step 1: Define the problem and identify key properties.\n\n*   **Simple graph:** No loops or multiple edges.\n*   **5 vertices:** Let the set of vertices be V, with |V|=5.\n*   **2-vertex-connected (or biconnected):** The graph is connected, and it remains connected after the removal of any single vertex. This is equivalent to saying the graph has no cut vertices (articulation points).\n*   **Non-isomorphic:** We are counting structurally unique graphs.\n\nA necessary condition for a graph to be 2-vertex-connected is that the minimum degree of any vertex (`δ(G)`) must be at least 2. If a vertex had a degree of 1, its only neighbor would be a cut vertex (unless the graph is just K2, which is not the case for n=5).\n\n### Step 2: Determine the range of possible edges `m`.\n\n*   **Minimum edges:** For a graph with `n=5` vertices and `δ(G) >= 2`, the sum of degrees is at least `5 * 2 = 10`. By the handshaking lemma, the number of edges `m` is half the sum of degrees, so `m >= 10 / 2 = 5`. The cycle graph C5 is 2-vertex-connected and has 5 edges, so the minimum is `m=5`.\n*   **Maximum edges:** The maximum possible number of edges in a simple graph with 5 vertices is the complete graph K5, which has `C(5,2) = 10` edges. K5 is 4-vertex-connected, which implies it is also 2-vertex-connected. So the maximum is `m=10`.\n\nWe need to count the number of 2-vertex-connected graphs for `m = 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10`.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze each case based on the number of edges `m`.\n\n**m = 5:**\n*   The sum of degrees is `2 * 5 = 10`. With 5 vertices and `δ(G) >= 2`, the only possible degree sequence is (2, 2, 2, 2, 2).\n*   The only graph with this degree sequence is the cycle graph, **C5**.\n*   **Connectivity Check:** Removing any vertex from C5 leaves a path P4, which is connected. Thus, C5 is 2-vertex-connected.\n*   Number of graphs = **1**.\n\n**m = 6:**\n*   The sum of degrees is `2 * 6 = 12`. We only need to consider graphs with `δ(G) >= 2`. The possible degree sequences are (3, 3, 2, 2, 2) and (4, 2, 2, 2, 2).\n*   For the sequence (4, 2, 2, 2, 2), a graph would be constructed from a central vertex connected to all 4 others (K1,4), with one more edge added between two of the outer vertices. The central vertex remains a cut vertex. So, no graph with this degree sequence is 2-connected.\n*   For (3, 3, 2, 2, 2), the graph can be formed by adding one edge (a chord) to C5. All possible chords in C5 result in isomorphic graphs. This graph is often called the \"house graph\".\n*   **Connectivity Check:** This graph is 2-vertex-connected (removing a degree-2 vertex leaves a C4 with a pendant edge; removing a degree-3 vertex leaves a C4).\n*   Number of graphs = **1**.\n\n**m = 7:**\n*   A 2-connected graph with `m=7` can be constructed by adding edges to the 2-connected graphs with `m=5` or `m=6`. We can add 2 edges to C5.\n*   C5 has 5 non-edges, all of which are chords of length 2 (e.g., (1,3)). We need to add two such chords. There are three non-isomorphic ways to do this:\n    1.  **Chords share a vertex:** e.g., (1,3) and (1,4). This gives a graph with degree sequence (4, 3, 3, 2, 2). It is 2-connected.\n    2.  **Chords are \"crossing\":** e.g., (1,3) and (2,4). This gives a graph with degree sequence (3, 3, 3, 3, 2). It is 2-connected. This graph is non-planar.\n    3.  **Chords are \"parallel\" (non-crossing):** e.g., (1,3) and (2,5). This also gives a degree sequence of (3, 3, 3, 3, 2). It is 2-connected. This graph is planar, so it is non-isomorphic to the previous one.\n*   These are the only three possibilities.\n*   Number of graphs = **3**.\n\n**m = 8:**\n*   For graphs with a large number of edges, it's easier to consider their complements. A graph with `m=8` has a complement with `m' = 10 - 8 = 2` edges.\n*   There are two non-isomorphic graphs with 5 vertices and 2 edges:\n    1.  **Two disjoint edges (P2 U P2 U K1):** The complement is K5 minus two disjoint edges. This graph is 2-vertex-connected.\n    2.  **A path of length 2 (P3 U K1 U K1):** The complement is K5 minus two edges that share a vertex. This graph is also 2-vertex-connected.\n*   Since the original 2-edge graphs are non-isomorphic, their complements are as well.\n*   Number of graphs = **2**.\n\n**m = 9:**\n*   The complement has `m' = 10 - 9 = 1` edge.\n*   There is only one non-isomorphic graph with 1 edge (P2 U 3K1).\n*   The complement is **K5 with one edge removed (K5-e)**.\n*   **Connectivity Check:** K5-e is 3-vertex-connected, so it is also 2-vertex-connected.\n*   Number of graphs = **1**.\n\n**m = 10:**\n*   The only graph is the **complete graph K5**.\n*   **Connectivity Check:** K5 is (5-1) = 4-vertex-connected, hence it is 2-vertex-connected.\n*   Number of graphs = **1**.\n\n### Step 4: Sum the results.\n\nTotal number of 2-vertex-connected simple nonisomorphic graphs with 5 vertices is the sum of the counts for each case:\nTotal = 1 (for m=5) + 1 (for m=6) + 3 (for m=7) + 2 (for m=8) + 1 (for m=9) + 1 (for m=10) = 9.\n\n<<<9>>>"
