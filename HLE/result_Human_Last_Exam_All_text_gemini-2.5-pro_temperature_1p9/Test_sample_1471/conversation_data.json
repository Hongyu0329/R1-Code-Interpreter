    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the equation.\n\n**Question Analysis**\nThe user wants to find the solution to the equation `XV / C - CMXCI = ?`. This equation is written using Roman numerals. The task is to convert the Roman numerals to modern numbers, solve the resulting arithmetic expression, and provide the final answer.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**Step 1: Convert the Roman numerals to modern numbers.**\n\n*   **XV**: This Roman numeral consists of two parts: `X` (10) and `V` (5). Since the smaller value (`V`) comes after the larger value (`X`), we add them.\n    *   `XV = 10 + 5 = 15`.\n\n*   **C**: This is the Roman numeral for `100`.\n    *   `C = 100`.\n\n*   **CMXCI**: This is a more complex numeral. We can break it down as follows:\n    *   `CM`: The smaller value `C` (100) comes before the larger value `M` (1000), so we subtract `C` from `M`. This gives `1000 - 100 = 900`.\n    *   `XC`: The smaller value `X` (10) comes before the larger value `C` (100), so we subtract `X` from `C`. This gives `100 - 10 = 90`.\n    *   `I`: This is the Roman numeral for `1`.\n    *   Combining these parts, we get `CMXCI = 900 + 90 + 1 = 991`.\n    *   **Careful point**: A common mistake is to add all the values. It is essential to correctly apply the subtractive principle for pairs like `CM` and `XC`.\n\n**Step 2: Rewrite the equation using modern numbers.**\n\nSubstituting the converted values back into the equation:\n`XV / C - CMXCI = ?`\nbecomes\n`15 / 100 - 991 = ?`\n\n**Step 3: Solve the equation following the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS).**\n\nThe order of operations requires that we perform division before subtraction.\n\n1.  **Division**: First, calculate `15 / 100`.\n    *   `15 / 100 = 0.15`\n\n2.  **Subtraction**: Now, substitute this result back into the expression.\n    *   `0.15 - 991`\n    *   **Careful point**: We are subtracting a larger number from a smaller number, so the result will be negative.\n    *   `0.15 - 991 = -990.85`\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe solution to the equation is -990.85.\n\n<<<-990.85>>>"
