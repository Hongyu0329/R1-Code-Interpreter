    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the first statute in the modern State of Israel to explicitly introduce the concept of \"good faith\".\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Key Terms of the Question**\n\n*   **\"Modern State of Israel\":** This refers to the period from the state's establishment in 1948 onwards. The law must be a statute passed by the Knesset.\n*   **\"First statute\":** This requires a chronological analysis. We need to find the earliest law that meets the criteria, not necessarily the most famous or comprehensive one.\n*   **\"Explicitly introduce\":** This is a crucial point. The concept must be written directly into the text of the law. It cannot be a principle that was later read into the law by judges through interpretation. The Hebrew term for \"good faith\" is \"Tom Lev\" (תום לב). We are looking for the first appearance of this term or its direct equivalent in the statutory text.\n*   **\"Concept of 'good faith'\":** This refers to the legal principle requiring parties to act honestly, fairly, and without seeking to deceive or mislead others in their dealings.\n\n**Step 2: Survey Relevant Israeli Legislation Chronologically**\n\nMany people associate the principle of good faith in Israeli law with the **Contracts (General Part) Law, 1973**. Its sections 12 (duty to negotiate in good faith) and 39 (duty to perform contractual obligations in good faith) are cornerstones of Israeli civil law. However, the question asks for the *first* statute, so we must investigate legislation enacted prior to 1973.\n\nThe 1960s saw a significant wave of original Israeli legislation aimed at replacing the old Ottoman and British Mandate laws. This is the most likely period to find the answer. Let's examine key civil statutes from that era:\n\n1.  **Agency Law, 1965 (חוק השליחות, תשכ\"ה-1965):**\n    *   Let's examine its text. Section 8, titled \"Duty of Loyalty,\" states: \"An agent shall be loyal to his principal and shall act in accordance with his instructions; in any matter not covered by instructions, he shall act in the manner that is customary and **in good faith**...\"\n    *   The original Hebrew uses the exact term: \"...בדרך המקובלת ובתום-לב\".\n    *   This law from 1965 clearly and explicitly introduces the duty of good faith.\n\n2.  **Sale Law, 1968 (חוק המכר, תשכ\"ח-1968):**\n    *   Section 6 of this law states: \"An obligation arising from a contract of sale shall be fulfilled in the customary manner and **in good faith**.\"\n    *   The Hebrew again uses the term: \"...בדרך מקובלת ובתום-לב\".\n    *   While this law includes the term, it was enacted in 1968, three years *after* the Agency Law.\n\n3.  **Land Law, 1969 (חוק המקרקעין, תשכ\"ט-1969):**\n    *   Section 10 of this law provides protection to a \"purchaser **in good faith**\" (\"רכישה בתום לב\").\n    *   This also explicitly uses the term, but it is from 1969, which is later than the Agency Law.\n\n**Step 3: Synthesize the Findings and Conclude**\n\n*   We have identified several statutes that explicitly use the term \"good faith\" (Tom Lev).\n*   The Contracts (General Part) Law, 1973, is a very important statute for this principle, but it is not the first.\n*   Comparing the enactment dates of the earlier laws:\n    *   **Agency Law:** 1965\n    *   **Sale Law:** 1968\n    *   **Land Law:** 1969\n*   The chronological order clearly shows that the Agency Law of 1965 was the first among these major civil statutes to explicitly codify the duty of good faith. There are no major civil statutes prior to 1965 that introduce this specific formulation.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Distinguishing \"explicit\" from \"implicit\":** It is important not to confuse the explicit statutory introduction of the term \"good faith\" with earlier judicial recognitions of similar equitable principles derived from British or Jewish law. The question is strictly about the statutory text.\n*   **The Importance of the 1960s Codification:** The answer lies within the context of the legislative project in the 1960s to create a modern, independent Israeli civil code. The Agency Law was a vanguard of this movement.\n*   **Avoiding the Common Pitfall:** The most common incorrect answer would be the Contracts (General Part) Law because of its broad and famous application of the good faith principle. The key to the correct answer is the word \"first.\"\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the first statute in the modern State of Israel to explicitly introduce the concept of \"good faith\" is the Agency Law, which was enacted in 1965. As per the instructions, the year should not be included in the final answer.\n\n<<<Agency Law>>>"
