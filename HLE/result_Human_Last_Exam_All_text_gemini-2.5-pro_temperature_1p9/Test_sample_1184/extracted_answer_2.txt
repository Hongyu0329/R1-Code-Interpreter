Based on structural and functional studies, the key amino acid residues in the human beta-1 subunit (CACNB1, UniProt: Q02641) are as follows:

**1) Hotspots for Interaction with the Alpha-1 Subunit:**
These residues are located in the Guanylate Kinase-like (GK) domain and form the Alpha Interaction Domain-Binding Pocket (ABP) that physically holds the alpha-1 subunit's AID motif.

*   **Y235:** Located in the 'hook' region of the GK domain, critical for binding affinity.
*   **L264, I268, V297:** Form the upper part of the hydrophobic binding groove.
*   **D300 and R338:** Form key electrostatic salt-bridge interactions with the AID.
*   **Y327, F330, L355, M359, W363:** Line the deep, hydrophobic portion of the binding groove.

**2) Hotspots for Fine-Tuning Gating Properties of the Alpha-1 Subunit:**
These residues are critical for modulating the channel's electrophysiological behavior, often through allosteric mechanisms that are distinct from the primary binding interaction.

*   **R157:** Located in the SH3 domain. This residue is a key determinant for shifting the voltage-dependence of activation to more negative potentials. Its mutation reduces this modulatory effect without abolishing binding.
*   **E274:** Located in the GK domain, adjacent to the main binding groove. This residue is a specific and critical regulator of the rate of fast inactivation for the Cav2.3 channel. Its mutation slows inactivation kinetics.
