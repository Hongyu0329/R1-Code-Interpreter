    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the Iliad, after Mount Olympus.\n\n**Step 1: Identify all mountains mentioned in the Iliad.**\nFirst, we must compile a list of all mountains that are explicitly named in the text of Homer's *Iliad*. These include:\n\n*   **Mount Olympus:** The home of the gods, central to the epic but explicitly excluded by the question.\n*   **Mount Ida:** Located in Anatolia (modern-day Turkey), this mountain overlooks the plain of Troy. Zeus frequently travels here to watch the battle between the Achaeans and Trojans.\n*   **Mount Samothrace:** The highest peak on the island of Samothrace, from which the god Poseidon watches the Trojan War.\n*   **Mount Athos:** In Book 14, the goddess Hera is described as passing over the peak of Athos on her journey from Olympus to Mount Ida.\n*   **Mount Pelion and Mount Ossa:** These two mountains in Thessaly, Greece, are mentioned together in a story told in Book 5. It recounts the myth of the giants Otus and Ephialtes, who attempted to pile Pelion on top of Ossa to attack the gods on Olympus.\n\n**Step 2: Verify these mountains are \"historical\".**\nAll the mountains listed above are real, physical locations that can be identified on a modern map.\n*   Mount Olympus is in Greece.\n*   Mount Ida is now known as Kaz Dağı in Turkey.\n*   The peak of Samothrace is called Fengari.\n*   Mount Athos is a mountain and peninsula in northeastern Greece.\n*   Mount Pelion and Mount Ossa are mountains in Thessaly, Greece.\n\n**Step 3: Find the modern elevation of each mountain.**\nTo determine the tallest, we need to find their actual heights:\n\n*   **Mount Olympus:** 2,918 meters (9,573 ft) - This is our baseline, to be excluded from the final answer.\n*   **Mount Athos:** 2,033 meters (6,670 ft).\n*   **Mount Ossa (modern Kissavos):** 1,978 meters (6,490 ft).\n*   **Mount Ida (modern Kaz Dağı):** 1,774 meters (5,820 ft).\n*   **Mount Pelion:** 1,624 meters (5,328 ft).\n*   **Mount Samothrace (peak Fengari):** 1,611 meters (5,285 ft).\n\n**Step 4: Compare the elevations and identify the tallest.**\nNow we arrange the mountains (excluding Olympus) from tallest to shortest:\n\n1.  **Mount Athos:** 2,033 m\n2.  **Mount Ossa:** 1,978 m\n3.  **Mount Ida:** 1,774 m\n4.  **Mount Pelion:** 1,624 m\n5.  **Mount Samothrace:** 1,611 m\n\n**Conclusion**\nAfter Mount Olympus, the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the *Iliad* is Mount Athos.\n\n<<<Mount Athos>>>"
