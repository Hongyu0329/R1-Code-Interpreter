    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the value of X-Y:\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Subject:** The question is about Pavel Milyukov (1859-1943), a major figure in Russian politics and intellectual life before and during the 1917 Revolution. He was the leader of the liberal Constitutional Democratic Party (Kadets) and a distinguished historian.\n\n2.  **Analyze Milyukov's Position:** The question states he \"frequently accused the Western culture of his time.\" This is a key point. While Milyukov was a political \"Westernizer\" who advocated for a constitutional, parliamentary system in Russia based on Western models, his cultural tastes were more conservative. He was a strong proponent of the 19th-century tradition of Realism in art and literature, which he believed should serve a clear social and civic purpose.\n\n3.  **Identify the Target of His Criticism:** Milyukov was a vocal and harsh critic of the new artistic movements that flourished in Russia around the turn of the 20th century, a period often called the \"Silver Age.\" He saw these movements—broadly encompassing Modernism, Decadence, and Symbolism—as a departure from the healthy, socially-engaged tradition of Realism. He viewed them as elitist, individualistic, esoteric, and a symptom of cultural decay, heavily influenced by what he considered the negative aspects of contemporary Western culture.\n\n4.  **Interpret the Metaphor \"Stagnant Swamp\":** The phrase \"stagnant swamp\" (`стоячее болото` in Russian) powerfully conveys Milyukov's critique. A swamp is stagnant, murky, unproductive, and disconnected from the flowing river of mainstream social life. This metaphor perfectly encapsulates his view of the new art and poetry as being self-absorbed, sterile, and having no positive direction or contribution to society's progress.\n\n5.  **Connect to \"X-Y\":** The placeholder \"X-Y\" represents a specific group that Milyukov targeted with this criticism. His polemics were directed against the entire modernist trend, but he specifically engaged in public disputes with its leading figures. This included artists of the *Mir Iskusstva* (World of Art) movement and, perhaps most famously, the writers who formed the school of Russian Symbolism.\n\n6.  **Determine the Specific Term:** The most prominent literary group embodying the \"decadent\" and \"art for art's sake\" principles that Milyukov reviled were the **Symbolist poets**. Leaders of this movement, such as Valery Bryusov and Konstantin Balmont, championed a new kind of poetry that was mystical, musical, and focused on individual spiritual and aesthetic experience rather than public concerns. Milyukov saw them as the primary example of this cultural \"stagnant swamp.\"\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   It's important to distinguish between Milyukov's political Westernism and his cultural conservatism. He wanted Russia to adopt Western political institutions but was wary of what he saw as decadent Western cultural trends.\n*   The \"Silver Age\" in Russia was a period of immense artistic innovation, but it was also met with strong opposition from traditionalists and rationalist liberals like Milyukov.\n*   The term \"stagnant swamp\" was a polemical insult, reflecting the deep cultural divides of the era.\n*   While his criticism also applied to painters and other artists, the Symbolist poets were a central and highly visible target for his denunciations of modernism.\n\nBy putting these pieces together, we can confidently identify \"X-Y\".\n\n<<<Symbolist poets>>>"
