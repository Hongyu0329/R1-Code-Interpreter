    "This is a classic and deep problem in point-set topology, specifically in continuum theory. To answer it, we need to analyze the properties of such spaces and use several key classification theorems developed over many decades.\n\n### Step 1: Define the key terms\n\n*   **Continuum:** A non-empty, compact, connected metric space.\n*   **Planar Continuum:** A continuum that can be embedded in the Euclidean plane, $\\mathbb{R}^2$. This means it is homeomorphic to some subset of $\\mathbb{R}^2$.\n*   **Homogeneous Space:** A topological space $X$ is homogeneous if for any two points $x, y \\in X$, there exists a homeomorphism $h: X \\to X$ such that $h(x) = y$. Intuitively, the space \"looks the same\" at every point.\n*   **Homeomorphism Class:** A collection of topological spaces that are all homeomorphic to each other. The question asks for the number of such classes for homogeneous planar continua.\n\n### Step 2: Handle the degenerate case\n\nA continuum can be degenerate (consisting of a single point) or non-degenerate (containing more than one point).\n*   **The Point:** A single point is a compact, connected metric space, clearly embeddable in the plane. It is also trivially homogeneous. This gives us our first homeomorphism class.\n\n### Step 3: Classify based on local connectedness\n\nFor non-degenerate continua, a crucial property is local connectedness.\n\n*   **Case 1: Locally Connected Homogeneous Planar Continua**\n    A theorem by G.T. Whyburn (1929) states that any locally connected, non-degenerate, homogeneous, planar continuum is homeomorphic to a simple closed curve (i.e., a circle).\n    *   **The Circle (SÂ¹):** The circle is a planar continuum (e.g., the unit circle in $\\mathbb{R}^2$). It is homogeneous, as any point can be mapped to any other point by a rotation. It is also locally connected.\n    Combining this with the degenerate case, the locally connected homogeneous planar continua are precisely the point and the circle. This gives us two distinct homeomorphism classes.\n\n*   **Case 2: Homogeneous Planar Continua that are NOT Locally Connected**\n    These are the more exotic \"fractal-like\" continua. Any such continuum must be **indecomposable**, meaning it cannot be written as the union of two proper subcontinua. If it were decomposable, it would be a simple closed curve, which is locally connected. So, we are looking for non-degenerate, indecomposable, homogeneous planar continua. The search for these objects was a major research program in the 20th century.\n\n### Step 4: Apply the grand classification theorem\n\nA major breakthrough by L.G. Oversteegen and E.D. Tymchatyn (1982) provided a powerful structural dichotomy:\n**Every homogeneous planar continuum is either tree-like or circle-like.**\n\n*   A continuum is **tree-like** if it can be represented as an inverse limit of finite trees. A key property is that it contains no simple closed curves.\n*   A continuum is **circle-like** if it can be represented as an inverse limit of circles.\n\nWe can now classify the non-locally connected cases based on this theorem.\n\n*   **Subcase 2a: Tree-like, indecomposable, homogeneous planar continua**\n    The point is the only degenerate tree-like continuum. For the non-degenerate case, a deep result in continuum theory states that the only such object is the **pseudo-arc**. The pseudo-arc was discovered by B. Knaster in 1922. R.H. Bing proved in 1951 that it is homogeneous. It is known to be tree-like and embeddable in the plane. It has also been shown to be the *unique* homogeneous tree-like continuum up to homeomorphism (besides the point). This gives us our third class.\n\n*   **Subcase 2b: Circle-like, indecomposable, homogeneous planar continua**\n    The classification of circle-like homogeneous continua is also a deep result, due to J. T. Rogers Jr., J. C. Mayer, and others. The general homogeneous circle-like continua include the circle itself, the solenoids, and a class of continua called circles of pseudo-arcs.\n    *   **Solenoids:** These are non-degenerate, indecomposable, circle-like, and homogeneous continua. However, a crucial result is that **no solenoid can be embedded in the plane**. Thus, they are not planar continua.\n    *   **The Circle:** This is circle-like, but as we saw, it is decomposable and locally connected. We have already counted it.\n    *   This leaves any remaining candidates. It turns out there is exactly one other such object that is planar: the **circle of pseudo-arcs**. This object was first constructed by Bing and Jones in 1960. It is non-degenerate, indecomposable, not locally connected, circle-like, and homogeneous. It was later proved that all such continua with these properties are homeomorphic, so they form a single class.\n\n### Step 5: Final Count\n\nBy combining all the cases, we have found four distinct homeomorphism classes of homogeneous planar continua. Let's list them with their distinguishing properties:\n\n1.  **The Point:** Degenerate, locally connected, tree-like.\n2.  **The Circle:** Non-degenerate, locally connected, decomposable, circle-like.\n3.  **The Pseudo-arc:** Non-degenerate, not locally connected, indecomposable, tree-like.\n4.  **The Circle of Pseudo-arcs:** Non-degenerate, not locally connected, indecomposable, circle-like.\n\nThese four classes are topologically distinct, and the classification theorems referenced show that this list is exhaustive. Therefore, there are exactly four such homeomorphism classes.\n\n<<<4>>>"
