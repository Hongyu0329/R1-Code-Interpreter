    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Define the function and the problem**\n\nWe are given two polynomials, $f(x)$ and $g(x)$, both of degree 3.\nThe conditions are that their derivatives, $f'(x)$ and $g'(x)$, are positive for all real numbers $x$. This means both $f$ and $g$ are strictly increasing functions.\n\nWe are looking for the maximum number of fixed points of the composite function $h(x) = f(g(x))$. A fixed point is a solution to the equation $h(x) = x$, or $f(g(x)) = x$.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the degree of the equation**\n\n*   $f(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 3. Let $f(x) = a_3x^3 + a_2x^2 + a_1x + a_0$ with $a_3 \\neq 0$.\n*   $g(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 3. Let $g(x) = b_3x^3 + b_2x^2 + b_1x + b_0$ with $b_3 \\neq 0$.\n*   The composite function $h(x) = f(g(x))$ is also a polynomial. Its degree is the product of the degrees of $f$ and $g$, which is $3 \\times 3 = 9$.\n*   The fixed point equation is $f(g(x)) = x$. We can write this as $P(x) = f(g(x)) - x = 0$.\n*   $P(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 9. By the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, a polynomial of degree $n$ can have at most $n$ real roots.\n*   Therefore, the equation $f(g(x))=x$ can have at most 9 solutions. The maximum number of fixed points is at most 9.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the constraints and determine if 9 is achievable**\n\nNow we must check if it's possible to construct functions $f$ and $g$ that satisfy the given constraints ($f' > 0$ and $g' > 0$) and for which $f(g(x)) = x$ has 9 distinct real roots.\n\n*   For $P(x) = f(g(x)) - x$ to have 9 distinct real roots, its graph must cross the x-axis 9 times. By Rolle's Theorem, between any two roots of $P(x)$, there must be a point where its derivative $P'(x)$ is zero. Thus, if $P(x)$ has 9 distinct real roots, its derivative $P'(x)$ must have at least 8 distinct real roots.\n*   Let's find the derivative $P'(x)$:\n    $P'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(f(g(x)) - x) = f'(g(x))g'(x) - 1$.\n*   For $P'(x)$ to have 8 real roots, the equation $f'(g(x))g'(x) = 1$ must have 8 real roots. Let's call the function $H(x) = f'(g(x))g'(x)$.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the function $H(x) = f'(g(x))g'(x)$**\n\n*   Since $f(x)$ is a degree 3 polynomial, its derivative $f'(x)$ is a degree 2 polynomial (a quadratic).\n*   Since $g(x)$ is a degree 3 polynomial, its derivative $g'(x)$ is a degree 2 polynomial.\n*   The conditions $f'(x)>0$ and $g'(x)>0$ for all $x$ mean that these quadratic functions are parabolas that open upwards and lie entirely above the x-axis.\n*   Now, let's find the degree of $H(x)$.\n    *   The degree of $g(x)$ is 3.\n    *   The degree of $f'(x)$ is 2. So the degree of the composite part $f'(g(x))$ is $2 \\times 3 = 6$.\n    *   The degree of $g'(x)$ is 2.\n    *   The degree of $H(x) = f'(g(x))g'(x)$ is the sum of the degrees of $f'(g(x))$ and $g'(x)$, which is $6 + 2 = 8$.\n*   So, $H(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 8. We need to know if the equation $H(x) = 1$ can have 8 distinct real solutions.\n\n**Step 5: Analyze the derivative of $H(x)$**\n\n*   A polynomial of degree 8 can intersect a horizontal line (like $y=1$) at most 8 times. For it to do so, it must have 7 local extrema (4 minima and 3 maxima, or vice versa) with the values at these extrema alternating on either side of the line $y=1$.\n*   The existence of 7 distinct local extrema for $H(x)$ requires its derivative, $H'(x)$, to have 7 distinct real roots. Let's find the degree of $H'(x)$.\n*   $H'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx} [f'(g(x))g'(x)]$. Using the product rule:\n    $H'(x) = [f''(g(x))g'(x)] \\cdot g'(x) + f'(g(x)) \\cdot g''(x)$\n    $H'(x) = f''(g(x))(g'(x))^2 + f'(g(x))g''(x)$\n*   Let's determine the degrees of the components:\n    *   $f(x)$: degree 3 $\\implies f'(x)$: degree 2 $\\implies f''(x)$: degree 1.\n    *   $g(x)$: degree 3 $\\implies g'(x)$: degree 2 $\\implies g''(x)$: degree 1.\n*   Now let's find the degree of each term in $H'(x)$:\n    *   First term: $f''(g(x))(g'(x))^2$. Degree is (deg $f'' \\circ g$) + 2(deg $g'$) = (1 $\\times$ 3) + 2(2) = $3+4=7$.\n    *   Second term: $f'(g(x))g''(x)$. Degree is (deg $f' \\circ g$) + (deg $g''$) = (2 $\\times$ 3) + 1 = $6+1=7$.\n*   Since both terms are of degree 7 and their leading coefficients can be shown to have the same sign (they are both positive if the leading coefficients of $f$ and $g$ are positive, which is required by $f'>0, g'>0$), they do not cancel out. Thus, $H'(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 7.\n\n**Step 6: Conclusion**\n\n1.  A polynomial of degree 7, like $H'(x)$, can have up to 7 distinct real roots.\n2.  It is possible to choose the parameters of the polynomials $f$ and $g$ (which control the coefficients of $H'(x)$) such that $H'(x)$ indeed has 7 distinct real roots.\n3.  This would mean $H(x)$ (the degree 8 polynomial) can have 7 local extrema.\n4.  By further adjusting the parameters of $f$ and $g$, we can scale and shift the graph of $H(x)$ so that its 7 local extrema lie alternately above and below the line $y=1$.\n5.  This construction ensures that the equation $H(x) = f'(g(x))g'(x) = 1$ has 8 distinct real roots.\n6.  This means that $P'(x) = H(x) - 1$ has 8 distinct real roots.\n7.  By Rolle's Theorem, this allows $P(x) = f(g(x)) - x$ to have up to 9 distinct real roots.\n8.  Since the degree of $P(x)$ is 9, it cannot have more than 9 roots.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of fixed points that $f(g(x))$ can have is 9."
