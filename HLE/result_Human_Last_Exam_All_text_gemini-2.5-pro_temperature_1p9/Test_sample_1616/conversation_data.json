    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of each word to determine which one has not undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n**1. Understand Trisyllabic Laxing**\n\nTrisyllabic Laxing (TSL) is a sound change rule in English with two main conditions:\n*   **The word must have at least three syllables.**\n*   The rule affects a **long (tense) vowel** that falls in the **antepenultimate syllable** (the third syllable from the end).\n*   The result is that this long vowel becomes **short (lax)**.\n\nA classic example is the change from *ser**e**ne* (/iː/, long vowel) to *ser**e**nity* (/ɛ/, short vowel). In *serenity* (se-ren-i-ty), the vowel in question is in the '-ren-' syllable, which is the third from the end.\n\n**2. Step-by-Step Analysis of Each Word**\n\nLet's examine each word based on the criteria for TSL.\n\n*   **southern**\n    *   **Syllable Count:** Two syllables (*south-ern*).\n    *   **Analysis:** Since the word has only two syllables, it does not have an antepenultimate (third-from-last) syllable. Therefore, it cannot undergo trisyllabic laxing. The vowel change from *south* (/aʊ/) to *southern* (/ʌ/) is a different historical shortening process, not TSL.\n\n*   **derivative**\n    *   **Syllable Count:** Four syllables (*de-riv-a-tive*).\n    *   **Analysis:** This word meets the syllable count requirement. Let's look for a base word. The base is *derive* (/dɪˈraɪv/), which has a long diphthong /aɪ/. In *derivative*, the corresponding syllable is '-riv-', which is the antepenultimate syllable. The vowel has shortened to /ɪ/. This is a classic example of TSL.\n\n*   **serenity**\n    *   **Syllable Count:** Four syllables (*se-ren-i-ty*).\n    *   **Analysis:** This word meets the syllable count requirement. The base word is *serene* (/səˈriːn/), which has a long vowel /iː/. In *serenity*, the corresponding syllable is '-ren-', the antepenultimate syllable. The vowel has shortened (or laxed) to /ɛ/. This is another classic example of TSL.\n\n*   **pleasant**\n    *   **Syllable Count:** Two syllables (*pleas-ant*).\n    *   **Analysis:** This word has only two syllables and thus lacks an antepenultimate syllable. It cannot have undergone trisyllabic laxing. The vowel change from *please* (/pliːz/) to *pleasant* (/plɛzənt/) is an example of a different rule called *pre-cluster shortening*, where a long vowel shortens before a consonant cluster.\n\n*   **gratitude**\n    *   **Syllable Count:** Three syllables (*grat-i-tude*).\n    *   **Analysis:** This word meets the syllable count requirement. The relevant syllable is the first one, *grat-*, which is the antepenultimate syllable. We can compare it to the related word *grateful* (/ˈɡreɪtfʊl/), where the root vowel is long (/eɪ/). In *gratitude*, this vowel is short (/æ/). This pattern fits the definition of TSL.\n\n*   **shadow**\n    *   **Syllable Count:** Two syllables (*shad-ow*).\n    *   **Analysis:** Like *southern* and *pleasant*, this word has only two syllables and does not have an antepenultimate syllable. Therefore, the conditions for trisyllabic laxing are not met, and the rule could not have applied. Furthermore, looking at its history (from Old English *sceadu*), the first syllable vowel has always been short, so it hasn't undergone the kind of shortening seen in the other words either.\n\n**3. Conclusion**\n\nThe words that have clearly undergone trisyllabic laxing are *derivative*, *serenity*, and *gratitude*.\n\nThe words that have *not* undergone trisyllabic laxing are *southern*, *pleasant*, and *shadow*, primarily because they do not have three or more syllables. However, the question asks for a single word. While all three are technically correct, *southern* and *pleasant* do show a vowel shortening process (just not TSL). *Shadow*, on the other hand, is a two-syllable word whose vowel was historically short and does not participate in a clear shortening alternation with a base word. This makes it the most straightforward and unambiguous example of a word that has not undergone this type of sound change.\n\n<<<shadow>>>"
