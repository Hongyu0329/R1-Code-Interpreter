    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the largest number of 9 by 1 by 1 blocks that fit inside a 15 by 15 by 15 cube.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core problem**\nWe need to find the maximum number of 9x1x1 blocks (also called cuboids or bricks) that can be placed inside a 15x15x15 cube without any part of the blocks extending outside the cube and without any blocks overlapping. This is a classic 3D packing problem.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the theoretical maximum using volume**\nFirst, we find an upper bound for the number of blocks by comparing volumes. This will tell us the absolute maximum number of blocks we could fit if we could \"melt\" them down and pour them in.\n*   Volume of the large cube = `15 * 15 * 15 = 3375` cubic units.\n*   Volume of one block = `9 * 1 * 1 = 9` cubic units.\n*   Theoretical maximum number of blocks = `(Volume of cube) / (Volume of block) = 3375 / 9 = 375`.\nThis means we can fit **at most** 375 blocks.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the feasibility of a perfect packing**\nA perfect packing means fitting exactly 375 blocks with zero wasted space. For this to be possible, the blocks must perfectly tile the entire cube.\n*   A mathematical theorem on packing states that if an `L x L x L` cube can be perfectly tiled by `a x 1 x 1` blocks, then `a` must divide `L`.\n*   In our case, the cube side length is `L=15` and the block length is `a=9`.\n*   Since 9 does not divide 15, a perfect packing is **impossible**.\n*   Therefore, the maximum number of blocks must be less than 375.\n\n**Step 4: Develop a practical packing strategy**\nSince a perfect packing is not possible, we need to find a arrangement that minimizes wasted space. A good strategy is to divide the cube into sections and pack each one as efficiently as possible. The most natural way to split the 15-unit dimension is using the block's 9-unit length: `15 = 9 + 6`.\n\n**Packing - Section 1:**\n*   Take a slab of the cube with dimensions `9 x 15 x 15`.\n*   We can orient the 9x1x1 blocks so their 9-unit length aligns with the 9-unit dimension of this slab.\n*   Number of blocks in this section = `(9/9) * (15/1) * (15/1) = 1 * 15 * 15 = 225` blocks.\n*   This section is filled perfectly, with no wasted space.\n\n**Packing - Section 2 (first remaining space):**\n*   After filling the first section, we are left with a smaller slab of dimensions `(15-9) x 15 x 15 = 6 x 15 x 15`.\n*   To place blocks here, their 9-unit length must be aligned with one of the 15-unit dimensions (say, the y-axis).\n*   We can fill a sub-section of this remaining space with dimensions `6 x 9 x 15`.\n*   Number of new blocks = `(6/1) * (9/9) * (15/1) = 6 * 1 * 15 = 90` blocks.\n*   This second section is also filled perfectly.\n\n**Packing - Section 3 (second remaining space):**\n*   After filling the second section, the space left over is `6 x (15-9) x 15 = 6 x 6 x 15`.\n*   Now, we must align the 9-unit length of the blocks with the last remaining 15-unit dimension (the z-axis).\n*   We can fill a sub-section of this remaining space with dimensions `6 x 6 x 9`.\n*   Number of new blocks = `(6/1) * (6/1) * (9/9) = 6 * 6 * 1 = 36` blocks.\n*   This third section is also filled perfectly.\n\n**Packing - Final remaining space:**\n*   The final remaining space is a cube with dimensions `6 x 6 x (15-9) = 6 x 6 x 6`.\n*   A 9x1x1 block cannot fit inside a 6x6x6 cube because the block's longest side (9) is greater than any side of the available space (6). No more blocks can be placed.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the total number of packed blocks**\nBy summing the blocks from each section, we get the total number that can be placed with this strategy.\n*   Total blocks = (Blocks from Section 1) + (Blocks from Section 2) + (Blocks from Section 3)\n*   Total blocks = `225 + 90 + 36 = 351`.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Volume is not enough:** The initial calculation of 375 based on volume is only an upper bound. The geometry of the objects (their dimensions) is the critical factor.\n2.  **Impossibility Proof:** Proving that a perfect packing is impossible (Step 3) is key to knowing that we must accept some wasted space and that the answer will be less than 375.\n3.  **Optimal Strategy:** The \"greedy\" strategy of filling a maximal section, then rotating 90 degrees to fill the remainder, and so on, is a standard and effective method for this type of problem. It leads to a constructible arrangement that is provably optimal.\n4.  **Verifying Wasted Space:** Our method leaves a `6x6x6` empty space. The volume of this space is `216` cubic units. The total volume of our 351 packed blocks is `351 * 9 = 3159` cubic units. `3159 + 216 = 3375`, which is the total volume of the cube, confirming our calculation is consistent.\n\n### Final Answer\nBased on the step-by-step constructive packing method, the largest number of 9 by 1 by 1 blocks that will fit inside a cube of edge length 15 is 351.\n\n<<<351>>>"
