    "This problem asks for the size of the smallest algebraic structure that allows for a non-trivial coloring of the figure-eight knot. Let's break down the analysis into clear steps.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding Knot Coloring and the Algebraic Structure\n\nKnot coloring is a method used to create knot invariants. The standard approach, known as Wirtinger coloring, assigns a \"color\" to each arc of a knot diagram. These colors are elements from a set, which is equipped with a binary operation that defines the coloring rule.\n\n1.  **The Colors:** The colors are typically taken from the set of integers modulo `n`, which is `Z_n = {0, 1, 2, ..., n-1}`. The number `n` is the number of colors.\n2.  **The Coloring Rule:** At each crossing in the knot diagram, three arcs meet. Let the color of the over-passing arc be `c`, and the colors of the two under-passing arcs be `a` and `b`. The coloring rule requires that the relation `2c ≡ a + b (mod n)` must hold.\n3.  **The Algebraic Structure:** The set `Z_n` with the binary operation `x * y = 2y - x (mod n)` forms an algebraic structure called a **dihedral quandle**, denoted `R_n`. A quandle is the formal structure that captures the essence of knot coloring, ensuring the number of colorings is invariant under Reidemeister moves.\n4.  **Non-trivial Coloring:** A coloring is considered \"trivial\" if all arcs have the same color. A \"non-trivial\" coloring must use at least two different colors. The question is asking for the smallest `n` (`n >= 2`) that allows for a non-trivial coloring of the figure-eight knot.\n\n### Step 2: Setting up Equations for the Figure-Eight Knot\n\nTo determine if a knot can be colored with `n` colors, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the coloring rule for each crossing. The figure-eight knot (denoted `4_1`) has a standard diagram with 4 arcs and 4 crossings.\n\nLet the colors of the four arcs be `x₁`, `x₂`, `x₃`, and `x₄`. By carefully labeling the arcs and applying the rule `2 * (over-arc) = (under-arc 1) + (under-arc 2)` at each crossing, we arrive at the following system of linear equations (modulo `n`):\n\n*   Crossing 1: `2x₁ = x₂ + x₄`\n*   Crossing 2: `2x₂ = x₃ + x₁`\n*   Crossing 3: `2x₃ = x₁ + x₄`\n*   Crossing 4: `2x₄ = x₂ + x₃`\n\nThis can be written in matrix form `M * x = 0 (mod n)`, where `x` is the column vector of colors and `M` is the coefficient matrix:\n`M = [[ 2, -1,  0, -1], [-1,  2, -1,  0], [-1,  0,  2, -1], [ 0, -1, -1,  2]]`\n\n### Step 3: The Condition for Non-Trivial Colorability\n\nA non-trivial solution to this system of equations exists if and only if the number of colors `n` shares a common factor (greater than 1) with a special value associated with the knot, called the **knot determinant**.\n\nThe knot determinant, `det(K)`, is the absolute value of the determinant of any `(k-1)x(k-1)` submatrix of the `k x k` coloring matrix `M`. (All such `(k-1)x(k-1)` determinants have the same absolute value).\n\nSo, the condition for a non-trivial `n`-coloring is: `gcd(det(K), n) > 1`.\n\n### Step 4: Calculating the Determinant for the Figure-Eight Knot\n\nLet's calculate `det(K)` for the figure-eight knot using its `4x4` matrix `M`. We remove one row and one column, for example, the last row and the last column, to get a `3x3` submatrix `M'`.\n\n`M' = [[ 2, -1,  0], [-1,  2, -1], [-1,  0,  2]]`\n\nNow, we compute the determinant of `M'`:\n`det(M') = 2 * det([[2, -1], [0, 2]]) - (-1) * det([[-1, -1], [-1, 2]]) + 0`\n`det(M') = 2 * (2*2 - (-1)*0) + 1 * ((-1)*2 - (-1)*(-1))`\n`det(M') = 2 * (4) + 1 * (-2 - 1)`\n`det(M') = 8 + 1 * (-3)`\n`det(M') = 8 - 3 = 5`\n\nThe knot determinant of the figure-eight knot is `det(K) = |5| = 5`.\n(This result can be confirmed using the Alexander polynomial `Δ_K(t)` of the figure-eight knot, as `det(K) = |Δ_K(-1)| = |(-1)^-1 - 3 + (-1)| = |-5| = 5`).\n\n### Step 5: Finding the Smallest Number of Colors\n\nWe are looking for the smallest integer `n >= 2` such that `gcd(det(K), n) > 1`.\nSince `det(K) = 5`, we need to find the smallest `n >= 2` such that `gcd(5, n) > 1`.\n\n*   For `n = 2`: `gcd(5, 2) = 1`. No non-trivial coloring.\n*   For `n = 3`: `gcd(5, 3) = 1`. No non-trivial coloring. (The figure-eight knot is not tricolorable).\n*   For `n = 4`: `gcd(5, 4) = 1`. No non-trivial coloring.\n*   For `n = 5`: `gcd(5, 5) = 5`. Since `5 > 1`, a non-trivial coloring exists.\n\nThe smallest integer `n` that allows a non-trivial coloring is 5.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe smallest algebraic structure that allows coloring the figure-eight knot is the dihedral quandle `R_5`. This structure is the set of colors `{0, 1, 2, 3, 4}`. The number of elements in this set is 5.\n\n<<<5>>>"
