    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question, leading to the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Core Concepts**\n\n*   **Feynman Path Integral Formalism:** This is a method in quantum field theory where physical quantities, like transition amplitudes or correlation functions, are calculated by summing over all possible \"histories\" or paths a system can take between initial and final states. Each path is weighted by a phase factor $e^{iS/\\hbar}$, where $S$ is the classical action for that path.\n*   **Bare Green's Function ($G_0$):** This is also known as the non-interacting propagator. It describes the probability amplitude for a single, non-interacting particle to propagate from one spacetime point to another. In the path integral formalism, it is calculated using the action of the non-interacting system, $S_0$.\n*   **Single-Particle Energy Eigenvalues ($\\epsilon_k$):** For a non-interacting system, the quantum states are described by a single-particle Hamiltonian, $\\hat{H}_0$. The energy eigenvalues $\\epsilon_k$ and their corresponding eigenfunctions $\\phi_k(x)$ are the solutions to the time-independent Schrödinger equation: $\\hat{H}_0 \\phi_k(x) = \\epsilon_k \\phi_k(x)$. The index $k$ represents the set of quantum numbers (e.g., momentum, spin) that uniquely identify a single-particle state.\n\n**Step 2: Formulate the Path Integral for the Bare Green's Function**\n\nThe bare Green's function is a two-point correlation function calculated from the path integral using the non-interacting action $S_0$.\n\n1.  **The Non-Interacting Action ($S_0$):** The action for a free (non-interacting) field $\\psi(x,t)$ is given by:\n    $S_0[\\psi^*, \\psi] = \\int dt \\, d^d x \\, \\psi^*(x,t) \\left( i\\hbar \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} - \\hat{H}_0 \\right) \\psi(x,t)$\n\n2.  **Change of Basis:** To see the dependence on $\\epsilon_k$, it is essential to work in the basis that diagonalizes the Hamiltonian $\\hat{H}_0$. This is the basis of its eigenfunctions $\\phi_k(x)$. We expand the field $\\psi(x,t)$ in this basis:\n    $\\psi(x,t) = \\sum_k c_k(t) \\phi_k(x)$\n    Here, $c_k(t)$ are time-dependent Grassmann numbers (for fermions) representing the amplitude of the system being in state $k$ at time $t$.\n\n3.  **Diagonalize the Action:** Substituting this expansion into the action and using the orthonormality of the eigenfunctions ($\\int d^dx \\, \\phi_{k'}^*(x) \\phi_k(x) = \\delta_{k'k}$) and the eigenvalue equation ($\\hat{H}_0 \\phi_k = \\epsilon_k \\phi_k$), the action simplifies and decouples for each mode $k$:\n    $S_0 = \\sum_k \\int dt \\, c_k^*(t) \\left( i\\hbar \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} - \\epsilon_k \\right) c_k(t)$\n\n**Step 3: Move to Frequency Space**\n\nThe relationship becomes most transparent in the frequency-energy domain. We perform a Fourier transform from time $t$ to frequency $\\omega$. Under this transform, the time derivative becomes algebraic: $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\rightarrow -i\\omega$.\n\n1.  **Fourier Transformed Action:** The action in frequency space becomes:\n    $S_0 = \\sum_k \\int \\frac{d\\omega}{2\\pi} c_k^*(\\omega) \\left( \\hbar\\omega - \\epsilon_k \\right) c_k(\\omega)$\n    This is now a simple quadratic form, diagonal in both the quantum numbers $k$ and the frequency $\\omega$.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Green's Function**\n\nIn the path integral formalism, the Green's function (or propagator) is the inverse of the quadratic kernel in the action.\n\n1.  **Inverse of the Kernel:** The kernel for the mode $(k, \\omega)$ is $(\\hbar\\omega - \\epsilon_k)$. A naive inversion gives:\n    $G_0(k, \\omega) \\propto \\frac{1}{\\hbar\\omega - \\epsilon_k}$\n\n2.  **The Feynman Prescription ($i\\eta$ term):** This naive result is incomplete. It has a pole on the real axis at $\\hbar\\omega = \\epsilon_k$, making integrals over frequency ill-defined. The Feynman path integral implicitly includes boundary conditions that correspond to time-ordering. This is mathematically implemented by shifting the pole slightly off the real axis with an infinitesimal imaginary term, often denoted $i\\eta$ or $i\\delta$.\n\n3.  **Dependence on the Ground State:** The sign of the $i\\eta$ term depends on the physics of the ground state. The ground state (or \"vacuum\") is the state where all single-particle energy levels up to the chemical potential $\\mu$ (or Fermi energy $\\epsilon_F$) are filled, and all levels above are empty.\n    *   **Particle Propagation:** For an empty state ($\\epsilon_k > \\mu$), the Green's function describes the propagation of an added particle. The pole is shifted into the lower half of the complex frequency plane to ensure correct time evolution.\n    *   **Hole Propagation:** For a filled state ($\\epsilon_k < \\mu$), the Green's function describes the propagation of a \"hole\" created by removing a particle. The pole is shifted into the upper half of the complex plane.\n\n**Step 5: The Final Result**\n\nCombining these points gives the full expression for the bare Green's function in the frequency-momentum representation. Let's define the energy relative to the chemical potential as $\\xi_k = \\epsilon_k - \\mu$. The sign of $\\xi_k$ determines if the state is particle-like or hole-like.\n\nThe functional dependence of the bare Green's function $G_0$ for mode $k$ and frequency $\\omega$ on the single-particle energy eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$ is:\n\n$G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\hbar\\omega - (\\epsilon_k - \\mu) + i\\eta \\, \\text{sgn}(\\epsilon_k - \\mu)}$\n\nwhere:\n*   $\\omega$ is the frequency.\n*   $\\mu$ is the chemical potential.\n*   $\\eta$ is a positive infinitesimal ($\\eta \\to 0^+$).\n*   $\\text{sgn}(x)$ is the sign function, which is +1 for $x>0$ and -1 for $x<0$.\n\nThis expression shows that **$G_0$ has a simple pole structure.** The functional dependence on $\\epsilon_k$ is such that the **real part of the pole's location in the energy domain ($\\hbar\\omega$) is precisely the single-particle energy $\\epsilon_k$, shifted by the chemical potential $\\mu$.**\n\n***\n\nThe functional dependence of the bare Green's function $G_0$ on the single-particle energy eigenvalues $\\epsilon_k$, in frequency ($\\omega$) and momentum/quantum number ($k$) space, is that of an inverse linear function, defining a simple pole. The location of this pole in the complex energy plane is determined by $\\epsilon_k$. Specifically, the relationship is given by:\n\n<<<\n$G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\hbar\\omega - (\\epsilon_k - \\mu) + i\\eta \\, \\text{sgn}(\\epsilon_k - \\mu)}$\n>>>"
