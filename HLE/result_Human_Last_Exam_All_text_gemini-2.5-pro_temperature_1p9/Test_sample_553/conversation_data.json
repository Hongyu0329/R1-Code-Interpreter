    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct song.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstructing the Musical Question\n\nFirst, let's break down the key terms in the question:\n\n*   **The Beatles:** The band whose music we are analyzing.\n*   **Starts with:** The chord change must happen at the very beginning of the song, as a primary feature of its introduction or opening theme.\n*   **Tonic Chord (I):** This is the \"home\" chord of the song's key. It's the chord built on the first note of the scale. For example, in the key of A major, the tonic chord is A major.\n*   **Minor Fifth Chord (v):** This is a chord built on the fifth note of the scale, but it's a minor chord. This is an unusual and distinct sound. In a major key, the chord on the fifth degree is typically major (written as V). For example, in the key of A major, the standard fifth chord (V) is E major. The minor fifth chord (v) would be E minor. This technique is known as \"modal interchange,\" as it borrows a chord from the parallel minor key.\n\nSo, we are looking for a Beatles song that starts with the progression **I -> v**.\nLet's use the key of F Major as an example:\n*   **Tonic (I):** F Major chord (F-A-C)\n*   **Fifth degree:** C\n*   **Minor Fifth Chord (v):** C minor chord (C-Eb-G)\nThe progression would be from **F Major to C minor**.\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing Beatles Songs\n\nNow, let's think about famous Beatles intros and their chord progressions.\n\n*   **\"A Hard Day's Night\":** Starts with a famous, complex dissonant chord. Not a I -> v progression.\n*   **\"Help!\":** Starts with a cappella vocals. When the band enters, the progression is Bm -> G -> A. In the key of A, this is ii -> bVII -> I. Not correct.\n*   **\"I Feel Fine\":** Starts with guitar feedback leading into a riff. The chords are G -> C -> G -> D. In the key of G, this is I -> IV -> I -> V. The V chord (D major) is major, not minor.\n*   **\"Can't Buy Me Love\":** Starts with the chorus. The chords are C -> G7. In the key of C, this is I -> V7. The V7 chord (G7) is major-based, not minor.\n*   **\"All My Loving\":** The intro/verse progression is C#m -> G#m -> A -> E. In the key of E, this is vi -> iii -> IV -> I. Not correct.\n\n### Step 3: Identifying the Correct Song\n\nLet's carefully analyze the song **\"Michelle\"** from the album *Rubber Soul* (1965).\n\n1.  **The Introduction:** The song begins with a short instrumental on an acoustic guitar featuring a descending bassline.\n2.  **The Opening Vocal Phrase:** The very first line Paul McCartney sings is the memorable \"Michelle, ma belle...\".\n3.  **Chord Analysis:**\n    *   On the word \"**Michelle**\", the harmony is an **F Major** chord. This chord functions as the tonic (I) for this opening section.\n    *   On the words \"**ma belle**\", the chord immediately changes to a **C minor** chord (Cm).\n4.  **Applying the Theory:**\n    *   The established key for the phrase is F major.\n    *   The tonic (I) is **F Major**.\n    *   The fifth degree of the F major scale is C.\n    *   The chord played is **C minor**, which is the minor fifth (v) chord.\n\nThus, the chord progression at the start of the vocal theme is **F Major -> C minor**, which is precisely **I -> v**. This specific and sophisticated chord change is responsible for the song's distinctive, wistful, and slightly melancholic character right from the outset.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe Beatles song that starts with a chord jump from the tonic (I) to the minor fifth chord (v) is \"Michelle\".\n\n<<<Michelle>>>"
