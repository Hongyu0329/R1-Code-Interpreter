    "Step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Analyze the movement:** The question asks about *cambré derrière*, which is a backward bend of the upper body from the waist. This movement requires flexibility in the spine and strength in the core and back muscles.\n\n2.  **Analyze the methods:** We need to compare the Vaganova method and the Balanchine method.\n    *   **Vaganova Method:** Developed by Agrippina Vaganova in Russia, this method is known for its systematic and progressive approach. It emphasizes core strength, stability, and precise, harmonious movement. Key principles include total body awareness and the idea that every movement originates from a stable core.\n    *   **Balanchine Method:** Developed by choreographer George Balanchine for his New York City Ballet, this method (often called a \"style\" or \"technique\" rather than a full \"method\") is known for its speed, musicality, and unconventional lines. It often pushes the boundaries of classical technique to achieve a specific neo-classical aesthetic.\n\n3.  **Compare the execution of *cambré derrière* in both methods:**\n    *   **Vaganova:** In a Vaganova cambré derrière, the primary rule is to maintain a stable, square pelvis. The dancer must lift the torso up out of the hips and bend backward from the upper and middle spine. The hips do not tilt back; they remain directly over the supporting leg(s). This approach builds immense upper back strength and ensures the bend is controlled and anatomically sound, protecting the lower back. The focus is on a pure spinal arch.\n    *   **Balanchine:** In the Balanchine style, achieving a specific visual line is often prioritized over maintaining strict anatomical alignment. To create a deeper and more dynamic backbend, the Balanchine method often permits or encourages the dancer to \"break\" the hip line. This means the hips may push forward slightly as the torso bends back, or if in a position like arabesque, the hip of the working leg may lift to allow for a deeper penchée (a form of cambré). This creates a different, often more extreme, aesthetic line.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the answer choices based on the comparison:**\n    *   **A. Arm placement during allongé:** While arm styling (port de bras) does differ between the methods, it is not the most fundamental or defining difference in the mechanics of the *cambré* itself. The core of the movement is in the torso and pelvis.\n    *   **B. Placement of hip:** This is the critical difference. Vaganova insists on square, stable hips. Balanchine allows for the hip line to be \"broken\" to achieve a different aesthetic and greater range. This is a foundational, mechanical distinction.\n    *   **C. Speed:** While Balanchine choreography is famously fast, a cambré can be performed at any speed in either style, depending on the specific exercise (adagio vs. allegro). Speed is a general characteristic of the style, not a defining mechanical difference of this particular step.\n    *   **D. Degree of backbend:** The degree of the bend is a *result* of the technique used. Allowing the hips to move in the Balanchine style can facilitate a deeper backbend, but the *cause* of this difference in degree is the hip placement. Therefore, hip placement is the more fundamental difference.\n    *   **E. Placement of head:** Head placement is part of the overall styling and epaulement, which certainly differs. However, the use of the hips dictates the entire structure and potential of the bend, making it a more primary distinction than the head position.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The most significant and technically defining difference between a cambré derrière in the Vaganova and Balanchine methods is the rule regarding the placement and stability of the hips.\n\n<<<B>>>"
