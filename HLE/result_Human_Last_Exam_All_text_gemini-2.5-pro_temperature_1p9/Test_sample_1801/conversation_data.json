    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe core components of the question are:\n*   **Who:** Two Nobel laureates.\n*   **What:** They were featured in a commercial.\n*   **For Whom:** The company was Enron.\n*   **When:** The year was 2000.\n*   **Which campaign:** The commercial had the tagline \"Ask Why.\"\n*   **Infamous:** The commercial is now considered infamous, which relates to Enron's subsequent collapse in a massive fraud scandal in 2001.\n\n**Step 2: Research the Enron \"Ask Why\" Campaign**\nIn 2000, Enron launched a major advertising campaign with the theme \"Ask Why.\" The campaign's purpose was to rebrand Enron from a simple energy pipeline company to a global, innovative tech and financial powerhouse. The ads were known for their intellectual, questioning tone and featured respected thinkers and academics. The campaign became infamous due to the deep irony of its tagline, as asking \"why\" about Enron's finances a year later would unravel one of the largest corporate frauds in U.S. history.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Featured Individuals and Verify their Nobel Status**\nResearch into this specific campaign reveals that several prominent economists were filmed for the commercials. The two most widely cited participants who are also Nobel laureates are:\n\n1.  **Paul Krugman:** A distinguished economist and public intellectual.\n2.  **Merton Miller:** A renowned financial economist.\n\n**Step 4: List Careful Points and Nuances**\n*   **Careful Point 1: Timing of the Nobel Prize.** While the question asks for two \"Nobel laureates,\" it's crucial to examine when they received the award.\n    *   **Merton Miller** was already a Nobel laureate when the commercial was made. He received the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in **1990**.\n    *   **Paul Krugman**, however, was not yet a Nobel laureate in 2000. He was a well-respected economist at MIT at the time, but he was awarded his Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences eight years later, in **2008**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The question refers to their status as \"Nobel laureates\" from a present-day perspective. Both are now Nobel laureates who appeared in the ad, so they are the correct answers.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Other Participants.** The \"Ask Why\" campaign featured other notable academics as well. For instance, Amartya Sen, who won the Nobel Prize in 1998 (and thus was a laureate at the time), also reportedly appeared in a spot for the campaign. However, the commercials featuring Krugman and Miller are the most frequently discussed in retrospectives about the infamous campaign.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: The Infamy.** The reason the commercials are \"infamous\" is directly tied to the Enron scandal. The company spent millions on a campaign that encouraged questioning and transparency, while simultaneously engaging in massive accounting fraud. The participation of respected figures like future (and current) Nobel laureates lent the company an unearned air of legitimacy, which they have since had to address. Paul Krugman, for instance, has publicly expressed his regret over his participation.\n\n**Step 5: Synthesize the Final Answer**\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the two Nobel laureates featured in Enron's infamous 2000 \"Ask Why\" commercial were Paul Krugman and Merton Miller. Merton Miller was already a Nobel laureate at the time, while Paul Krugman would receive his prize several years later.\n\n<<<Paul Krugman and Merton Miller>>>"
