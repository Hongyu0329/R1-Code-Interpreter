    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to design the observer.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Problem\nWe are given a discrete-time linear time-invariant (LTI) system:\nx(k + 1) = Ax(k) + Bu(k)\ny(k) = Cx(k)\n\nwith matrices:\nA = [[-1, 0, 0, 1], [1, 0, 0, 2], [0, 1, 0, -1], [-1, 0, 1, -1]]\nB = [[0], [1], [-1], [1]]\nC = [[1, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 1]]\n\nThe state vector dimension is n = 4, and the output vector dimension is m = 2.\n\nWe need to design a full-state observer:\nx̂(k + 1) = Ax̂(k) + Bu(k) + L(y(k) - ŷ(k))\nwhere L is the observer gain matrix.\n\nThe objective is to make the observation error, e(k) = x(k) - x̂(k), equal to zero in the shortest possible number of steps. This is known as a deadbeat observer design.\n\n### Step 2: Error Dynamics\nThe dynamics of the observation error are given by:\ne(k + 1) = (A - LC)e(k)\n\nFor the error to go to zero in a finite number of steps (deadbeat response), the observer error dynamics matrix, (A - LC), must be nilpotent. This means that for some integer ν, (A - LC)^ν = 0. This is achieved by placing all the eigenvalues (poles) of the matrix (A - LC) at the origin (z=0). The desired characteristic polynomial is p(z) = z^n = z^4.\n\n### Step 3: Check for Observability\nA condition for being able to place the observer poles arbitrarily is that the system must be observable. The system is observable if the observability matrix O has full rank (rank n = 4).\nO = [C; CA; CA^2; ...; CA^(n-1)] = [C; CA; CA^2; CA^3]\n\nWe check the rank of sub-matrices of O to find the observability index ν, which is the smallest integer for which rank([C; CA; ...; CA^(ν-1)]) = n. This index represents the minimum number of steps required to determine the state, and thus the shortest possible time for the error to become zero.\n\n- C = [[1, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 1]]. Rank(C) = 2.\n- CA = [[-1, 0, 0, 1], [-2, 0, 1, 0]]. Rank([C; CA]) = 3.\n- CA^2 = [[0, 0, 1, -2], [2, -1, 2, -3]]. Rank([C; CA; CA^2]) = 4.\n\nSince the rank reaches n=4 at the CA^2 term, the system is observable and the observability index is ν = 3. This confirms that an observer can be designed to make the error zero in 3 steps. A deadbeat observer placing all poles at z=0 will make the error zero in at most n=4 steps, and possibly in ν=3 steps, depending on the resulting Jordan form of (A-LC). Designing for poles at zero is the standard approach for a deadbeat observer.\n\n### Step 4: Observer Gain Design using Pole Placement\nThe design problem is to find the 4x2 gain matrix L such that the eigenvalues of (A - LC) are all zero. The characteristic polynomial must be det(zI - (A - LC)) = z^4.\n\nThis is a multi-output pole placement problem. Since we have more outputs than required for observability (m > 1), there is an infinite number of solutions for L. We can simplify the problem by choosing a simpler form for L.\n\nLet's test if the system is observable using only the first output, y1. This corresponds to the first row of C, c1' = [1, 0, 0, 0]. We must check if the pair (A, c1') is observable.\nThe observability matrix for (A, c1') is:\nO1 = [c1'; c1'A; c1'A^2; c1'A^3]\n- c1' = [1, 0, 0, 0]\n- c1'A = [-1, 0, 0, 1]\n- c1'A^2 = [0, 0, 1, -2]\n- c1'A^3 = [2, 1, -2, 1]\n\nO1 = [[1, 0, 0, 0], [-1, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1, -2], [2, 1, -2, 1]]\nThe determinant of O1 is -1, so it has full rank. The pair (A, c1') is observable.\n\nThis means we can design the observer using only the first output y1. This is equivalent to setting the second column of the gain matrix L to zero. Let L = [l, 0], where l is a 4x1 vector and 0 is a 4x1 zero vector.\n\nNow, A - LC = A - [l, 0] * C = A - l * c1'. This is a standard single-output pole placement problem.\n\n### Step 5: Solving for the Gain Vector l\nWe can use duality to solve this problem. The poles of A - l*c1' are the same as the poles of (A - l*c1')' = A' - c1*l'. This is a state-feedback controller design problem for the controllable pair (A', c1). Let the feedback gain be k' = l'. We need to find k' such that the poles of A' - c1*k' are at zero.\n\nThe desired characteristic polynomial for A' - c1*l' is p(z) = z^4.\nLet l = [l1; l2; l3; l4].\nA' - c1*l' =\n[[-1, 1, 0, -1],    [[1,0,0,0]*[l1,l2,l3,l4]],    [[-1-l1, 1-l2, -l3, -1-l4],\n [0,  0, 1,  0],  - [     zeros      ],  = [  0,     0,     1,      0  ],\n [0,  0, 0,  1],    [     zeros      ],    [  0,     0,     0,      1  ],\n [1,  2,-1, -1]]    [     zeros      ]]    [  1,     2,    -1,     -1  ]]\n\nThe characteristic polynomial det(zI - (A' - c1*l')) is:\np(z) = | z+1+l1   l2-1   l3    l4+1 |\n       |   0       z     -1      0   |\n       |   0       0      z     -1   |\n       |  -1      -2      1    z+1  |\n\nExpanding the determinant gives:\np(z) = z^4 + (2+l1)z^3 + (3+l1+l4)z^2 + (-1+l1+l3)z + (-3-2l1+l2)\n\nWe want this to be equal to the desired polynomial z^4. By equating the coefficients, we get a system of linear equations:\n1.  Coeff of z^3:  2 + l1 = 0   => l1 = -2\n2.  Coeff of z^2:  3 + l1 + l4 = 0   => 3 + (-2) + l4 = 0 => 1 + l4 = 0 => l4 = -1\n3.  Coeff of z^1:  -1 + l1 + l3 = 0  => -1 + (-2) + l3 = 0 => -3 + l3 = 0 => l3 = 3\n4.  Coeff of z^0:  -3 - 2l1 + l2 = 0 => -3 - 2(-2) + l2 = 0 => -3 + 4 + l2 = 0 => 1 + l2 = 0 => l2 = -1\n\nSo the gain vector is l = [-2; -1; 3; -1].\n\n### Step 6: Final Observer Gain Matrix\nSince we chose L = [l, 0], the final gain matrix is:\nL = [[-2, 0],\n     [-1, 0],\n     [ 3, 0],\n     [-1, 0]]\n\nThis observer gain matrix L places all the poles of the error dynamics at the origin, ensuring the observation error converges to zero in at most 4 steps, thus achieving a deadbeat response.\n\n<<<\n[[-2, 0], [-1, 0], [3, 0], [-1, 0]]\n>>>"
