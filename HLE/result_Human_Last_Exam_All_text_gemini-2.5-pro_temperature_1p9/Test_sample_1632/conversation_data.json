    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the value of a(10), the number of 10-step self-avoiding walks on a Manhattan lattice.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\n*   **Manhattan Lattice:** This is a 2D square grid where movement is restricted to four directions: up, down, left, and right. It's like navigating the streets of Manhattan.\n*   **n-step Walk:** A sequence of n connected moves on the lattice. A walk of n steps involves n+1 distinct points (vertices).\n*   **Self-Avoiding Walk (SAW):** A walk that never visits the same point more than once.\n*   **a(n):** The total number of unique n-step self-avoiding walks starting from a fixed point (usually the origin, (0,0)). The final number is independent of the starting point.\n\n### Step 2: Analysis for Small Values of n\n\nLet's calculate the number of walks for the first few steps to understand the process. We assume the walk starts at (0,0).\n\n*   **n = 1: a(1)**\n    *   From the origin (0,0), you can make one step in 4 possible directions: (1,0), (-1,0), (0,1), or (0,-1).\n    *   All these walks are unique and self-avoiding.\n    *   **a(1) = 4**\n\n*   **n = 2: a(2)**\n    *   Consider any 1-step walk, for example, to (1,0). From (1,0), you have 4 possible directions.\n    *   However, one direction, back to (0,0), is forbidden because the walk must be self-avoiding.\n    *   This leaves 3 valid moves: to (2,0), (1,1), or (1,-1).\n    *   Since there were 4 possible first steps, and each has 3 valid subsequent steps:\n    *   **a(2) = 4 * 3 = 12**\n\n*   **n = 3: a(3)**\n    *   At the end of any 2-step walk, we consider the next move.\n    *   Let's check if a 3-step walk can intersect with its starting point. The closest a 2-step walk's endpoint can be to the origin is at coordinates like (1,1) or (2,0). A single move from these points cannot reach the origin (0,0).\n    *   Therefore, the only forbidden move at step 3 is the one that immediately reverses step 2. This leaves 3 valid moves from the endpoint of any 2-step walk.\n    *   **a(3) = a(2) * 3 = 12 * 3 = 36**\n\n### Step 3: Listing Careful Points (The Breakdown of Simple Multiplication)\n\nOne might assume a(n) = a(n-1) * 3, but this pattern does not hold. The key complication arises when a walk can get close enough to intersect with a point it visited earlier (other than the immediately preceding one).\n\n*   **Careful Point for n = 4:**\n    *   Let's analyze a specific 3-step path: (0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1) → (0,1).\n    *   The walk has visited points {(0,0), (1,0), (1,1), (0,1)}. The current position is (0,1).\n    *   The possible moves from (0,1) are to (1,1), (-1,1), (0,2), and (0,0).\n    *   We cannot move to (1,1) because that was the previous point.\n    *   We also cannot move to (0,0) because that was the starting point of the walk.\n    *   So, for this specific path, there are only **2** valid choices for the 4th step, not 3.\n*   **Conclusion:** The number of available moves at any step `k` depends on the entire geometry of the walk from step 0 to `k-1`, not just the last move.\n\n### Step 4: Acquiring the Final Answer for a(10)\n\nCalculating a(n) for larger `n` requires a computer algorithm. There is no simple closed-form formula for a(n). The problem is a classic in computational physics and combinatorics, and the values have been determined by extensive computer enumerations (typically using a recursive backtracking algorithm).\n\nThese well-established values are cataloged in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS). The sequence for n-step SAWs on a square lattice is A001411.\n\nLet's list the known values of a(n) from this sequence:\n*   a(0) = 1\n*   a(1) = 4\n*   a(2) = 12\n*   a(3) = 36\n*   a(4) = 100\n*   a(5) = 284\n*   a(6) = 780\n*   a(7) = 2,172\n*   a(8) = 5,916\n*   a(9) = 16,268\n*   **a(10) = 44,100**\n\nThe value for a(10) is the 11th term in this sequence (as it starts with n=0). Based on these reliable, computationally-derived results, we can find the answer.\n\n<<<44100>>>"
