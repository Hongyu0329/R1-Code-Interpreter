    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the scaling exponent $\\alpha$ for the specific heat in $d=3$ using the epsilon expansion.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Theoretical Context and the Question**\n\nThe question asks for the critical exponent $\\alpha$ for the specific heat ($C \\sim |t|^{-\\alpha}$, where $t$ is the reduced temperature). The theoretical framework is the Renormalization Group (RG) and the specific technique is the epsilon ($\\epsilon$) expansion. The system is in a spatial dimension of $d=3$.\n\n**Careful Point:** The epsilon expansion is a perturbative technique valid near the upper critical dimension, $d_c$. The results are expressed as a power series in $\\epsilon = d_c - d$. The question implies we should use this method and then evaluate the result for our specific case where $d=3$.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Upper Critical Dimension and Epsilon**\n\nFor a wide range of standard models of critical phenomena (like the Ising, XY, and Heisenberg models, collectively known as O(n) models), the upper critical dimension is $d_c = 4$. This is the dimension above which mean-field theory exponents become correct.\n\nThe expansion parameter $\\epsilon$ is defined as:\n$\\epsilon = d_c - d$\n\nFor the given spatial dimension $d=3$:\n$\\epsilon = 4 - 3 = 1$\n\n**Careful Point:** Using the expansion for $\\epsilon=1$ is an extrapolation. The $\\epsilon$ expansion is formally an asymptotic series, and for $\\epsilon=1$, the leading order term provides an estimate, but its accuracy is not guaranteed to be high. However, the question specifically asks for the result from this method.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Universality Class**\n\nCritical exponents depend on the universality class, which is primarily determined by the spatial dimension $d$ and the symmetry of the order parameter (described by the number of components, $n$). The problem does not specify the model. In such cases, the standard convention is to assume the simplest and most common case, the **Ising universality class**, which has a scalar order parameter.\n\nFor the Ising model, the number of components of the order parameter is $n=1$.\n\n**Step 4: Use Scaling Relations and Known Expansions**\n\nThe critical exponents are connected by scaling relations. One of the most important is the **hyperscaling relation**, which connects the specific heat exponent $\\alpha$, the correlation length exponent $\\nu$, and the spatial dimension $d$:\n\n$2 - \\alpha = \\nu d$\n\nTo find $\\alpha$, we first need the epsilon expansion for $\\nu$. The one-loop (first order in $\\epsilon$) result for the correlation length exponent $\\nu$ in the O(n) model is a standard result from RG theory:\n\n$\\nu = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{n+2}{4(n+8)}\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n\n**Careful Point:** The coefficients in the expansion are universal (they don't depend on the microscopic details of the system) and independent of the specific regularization scheme used in the RG calculation. We are using the well-established one-loop result.\n\n**Step 5: Derive the Epsilon Expansion for α**\n\nNow, we substitute the expansion for $\\nu$ and the relation $d = 4 - \\epsilon$ into the hyperscaling formula:\n\n$2 - \\alpha = \\left( \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{n+2}{4(n+8)}\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2) \\right) (4 - \\epsilon)$\n\nWe expand the right-hand side and keep terms up to the first order in $\\epsilon$. Higher-order terms like $\\epsilon^2$ are neglected in a first-order calculation.\n\n$2 - \\alpha \\approx \\left( \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{n+2}{4(n+8)}\\epsilon \\right) \\times 4 - \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right) \\times \\epsilon$\n$2 - \\alpha \\approx 2 + \\frac{4(n+2)}{4(n+8)}\\epsilon - \\frac{1}{2}\\epsilon$\n$2 - \\alpha \\approx 2 + \\left( \\frac{n+2}{n+8} - \\frac{1}{2} \\right)\\epsilon$\n\nNow, we can solve for $\\alpha$:\n$-\\alpha \\approx \\left( \\frac{n+2}{n+8} - \\frac{1}{2} \\right)\\epsilon$\n$\\alpha \\approx \\left( \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{n+2}{n+8} \\right)\\epsilon$\n\nLet's combine the terms in the parenthesis:\n$\\alpha \\approx \\left( \\frac{1(n+8) - 2(n+2)}{2(n+8)} \\right)\\epsilon$\n$\\alpha \\approx \\left( \\frac{n+8 - 2n - 4}{2(n+8)} \\right)\\epsilon$\n$\\alpha \\approx \\frac{4-n}{2(n+8)}\\epsilon$\n\nThis is the general first-order expression for $\\alpha$ for the O(n) model.\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the Final Answer**\n\nFinally, we substitute the specific values for our problem: $n=1$ (Ising model) and $\\epsilon=1$ ($d=3$).\n\n$\\alpha \\approx \\frac{4-1}{2(1+8)} \\times 1$\n$\\alpha \\approx \\frac{3}{2(9)}$\n$\\alpha \\approx \\frac{3}{18}$\n$\\alpha = \\frac{1}{6}$\n\n**Final Careful Check:** The result $\\alpha = 1/6 \\approx 0.167$ is the canonical first-order $\\epsilon$-expansion result. For comparison, more precise experimental and numerical results for the 3D Ising model yield $\\alpha \\approx 0.110$. The discrepancy highlights that $\\epsilon=1$ is not particularly \"small,\" but the first-order calculation correctly predicts a small positive value for $\\alpha$, indicating a divergent specific heat.\n\n***\n\nThe final answer is derived by calculating the first-order term in the epsilon expansion for the specific heat exponent α in the Ising universality class ($n=1$) and evaluating it at $d=3$ ($\\epsilon=1$).\n\n<<<1/6>>>"
