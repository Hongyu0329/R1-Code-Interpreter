    "Of course. Let's break down the question and analyze the poem 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam to find the precise answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understanding the Question:**\nThe user wants to know the specific range of verses (from which *bayt* to which *bayt*) in the poem *'Aqeedat al-'Awaam* where the names of the 25 Prophets mentioned in the Quran are listed.\n\n**2. Context of the Poem:**\n*'Aqeedat al-'Awaam'* (The Creed of the Laymen) is a famous didactic poem by Sayyid Ahmad al-Marzuqi. Its purpose is to teach the essential articles of Islamic faith (`aqeedah`) in a simple, rhyming format that is easy to memorize. The poem is structured, moving from the attributes of Allah to the attributes of His Messengers, and then listing the Prophets by name.\n\n**3. Locating the Relevant Section:**\nThe poem systematically discusses various tenets. The section on the Messengers (`rusul`) has two parts:\n*   First, it mentions the four necessary attributes (Sidiq, Amanah, Tabligh, Fatanah), the four impossible attributes, and the one permissible attribute for them.\n*   Second, it states that it is obligatory to know the names of 25 specific Prophets and then proceeds to list them. We need to find the start and end of this list.\n\n**4. Finding the Starting Verse:**\nTo find the start, we look for the verse that introduces the list and the one that begins naming the prophets.\n\n*   **Bayt (Verse) 39** serves as an introduction. It states:\n    > وَتَفْصِيلُ خَمْسَةٍ وَعِشْرِينَ لَزِمْ ** كُلَّ مُكَلَّفٍ فَحَقِّقْ وَاغْتَنِمْ\n    > (Wa tafseelu khamsatin wa 'ishreena lazim ** Kulla mukallafin fa-haqqiq w'aghtanim)\n    > **Translation:** \"And the details of twenty-five (prophets) are binding ** Upon every accountable person, so verify and take this opportunity.\"\n\n*   This verse *tells* us that a list is coming, but it doesn't contain any names. The question asks from which bayt the *names are mentioned*. The actual mentioning of names begins in the very next verse.\n\n*   **Bayt (Verse) 40** is where the enumeration starts:\n    > هُمْ آدَمٌ اِدْرِيسُ نُوحٌ هُودُ مَعْ ** صَالِحٍ وَإِبْرَاهِيمُ كُلٌّ مُتَّبَعْ\n    > (Hum Adamun Idreesu Noohun Hoodu ma' ** Salihin wa Ibraheemu kullun muttaba')\n    > **Translation:** \"They are Adam, Idris, Nuh, Hud along with ** Salih, and Ibrahim—each one is to be followed.\"\n\nTherefore, the starting point for the list of names is **Bayt 40**.\n\n**5. Finding the Ending Verse:**\nWe now need to follow the list until it concludes. The list ends with the final prophet, Muhammad (peace be upon him).\n\n*   **Bayt (Verse) 41** continues the list:\n    > لُوطٌ وَاِسْمَاعِيلُ اِسْحَاقُ كَذَا ** يَعْقُوبُ يُوسُفُ وَأَيُّوبُ احْتَذَى\n    > **Prophets mentioned:** Lut, Isma'il, Ishaq, Ya'qub, Yusuf, Ayyub.\n\n*   **Bayt (Verse) 42** continues:\n    > شُعَيْبُ هَارُونُ وَمُوسَى وَالْيَسَعْ ** ذُو الْكِفْلِ دَاوُدُ سُلَيْمَانُ اتَّبَعْ\n    > **Prophets mentioned:** Shu'ayb, Harun, Musa, Al-Yasa', Dhu'l-Kifl, Dawud, Sulayman.\n\n*   **Bayt (Verse) 43** concludes the list:\n    > إِلْيَاسُ يُونُسُ زَكَرِيَّا يَحْيَى ** عِيسَى وَطَهَ خَاتِمٌ دَعْ غَيَّا\n    > ('Ilyasu Yoonusu Zakariyya Yahya ** 'Eesa wa Taha khaatimun da' ghayya)\n    > **Translation:** \"Ilyas, Yunus, Zakariyya, Yahya, ** 'Isa, and Taha (a name for Prophet Muhammad ﷺ), the seal (of the prophets), so leave deviation.\"\n\nThe list ends here with the mention of Prophet Muhammad ﷺ (as \"Taha\") and the declaration that he is the \"seal\" (*khaatim*). The next verse, Bayt 44, moves on to a different topic (the angels).\n\nTherefore, the ending point for the list of names is **Bayt 43**.\n\n### Careful Points to Note:\n\n1.  **Verse Numbering:** The numbering (39, 40, 41, 42, 43) is standard in most well-known publications and commentaries of the poem. However, very slight variations might exist in obscure manuscripts, but the sequence of verses remains the same.\n2.  **Introductory Verse:** It is crucial to distinguish between Bayt 39, which introduces the list, and Bayt 40, where the names actually begin to be mentioned. The question is specific about where the *names* are listed.\n3.  **Name of Prophet Muhammad ﷺ:** In Bayt 43, Prophet Muhammad is referred to by the name \"Taha\" (طه), which are letters from the opening of Surah Taha in the Quran and are used as one of his honorable titles.\n4.  **Completeness:** These four verses (40-43) contain all 25 prophets whose names are obligatory for a Muslim to know according to this school of thought.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nThe analysis confirms that the list of the prophets' names begins in Bayt 40 and concludes in Bayt 43.\n\n<<<From Bayt 40 to Bayt 43>>>"
