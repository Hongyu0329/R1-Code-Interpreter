    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the definitions\n\nFirst, we need to be precise about the two key concepts in the question: \"Sidon set\" and \"Hausdorff dimension\".\n\n*   **Sidon Set:** A subset `A` of an additive abelian group (in this case, the real numbers `(ℝ, +)`) is called a Sidon set (or a $B_2$ set) if all pairwise sums of its elements are unique up to the order of summands. Formally, for any `a₁, a₂, a₃, a₄ ∈ A`, if `a₁ + a₂ = a₃ + a₄`, then the multiset `{a₁, a₂}` must be equal to the multiset `{a₃, a₄}`. This means either (`a₁ = a₃` and `a₂ = a₄`) or (`a₁ = a₄` and `a₂ = a₃`). A simple consequence is that a Sidon set cannot contain a non-trivial three-term arithmetic progression (i.e., `x, x+d, x+2d` with `d ≠ 0`), because `x + (x+2d) = (x+d) + (x+d)`.\n\n*   **Hausdorff Dimension:** The Hausdorff dimension, denoted `dim_H(S)`, is a way to assign a (possibly non-integer) dimension to any set `S` in a metric space. It generalizes the standard notion of dimension. For example, a point has dimension 0, a line segment has dimension 1, and a square has dimension 2. Fractal sets, like the Cantor set, can have non-integer dimensions. The set in our question is a subset of `[0, 1]`, so its Hausdorff dimension must be between 0 and 1.\n\nThe question asks for the maximum possible value of `dim_H(A)` for any set `A ⊆ [0, 1]` that is a Sidon set.\n\n### Step 2: Search for an upper bound\n\nIs there a theoretical limit on how \"large\" a Sidon set can be? A set with a higher Hausdorff dimension is, in a sense, \"larger\" or \"denser\" than a set with a lower dimension. The Sidon property, which restricts additive patterns, seems to imply a certain \"sparseness\" that should limit the dimension.\n\nThis intuition turns out to be correct. A key result in this area is a theorem by the Hungarian mathematician Tamás Keleti. In his 2009 paper, \"Hausdorff dimension of Sidon sets\", he proved the following:\n\n**Theorem (Keleti, 2009):** If `A` is a Sidon set in `ℝ^d`, then `dim_H(A) ≤ d/2`.\n\nFor the specific question asked, the set `A` is a subset of the real numbers `ℝ`, so the ambient space is `ℝ¹` (`d=1`). Applying Keleti's theorem, we get:\n`dim_H(A) ≤ 1/2`.\n\nThis establishes an upper bound: the Hausdorff dimension of a Sidon set in `[0, 1]` can be no more than 1/2.\n\n### Step 3: Search for a lower bound and check for sharpness\n\nNow we know the answer is at most 1/2. The next question is whether this bound can be achieved. Is there an example of a Sidon set `A ⊆ [0, 1]` that actually has a Hausdorff dimension of 1/2? If such a set exists, then the maximum is exactly 1/2.\n\nConstructing such sets is not trivial. Simple fractal constructions like the standard middle-third Cantor set are not Sidon sets. A more intricate construction is needed.\n\nSuch a construction was provided by Renzo Tesoro in his 2012 PhD thesis. He explicitly constructed a set `A ⊆ [0, 1]` and proved two things about it:\n1.  The set `A` is a Sidon set.\n2.  The Hausdorff dimension of `A` is exactly 1/2.\n\nTesoro's construction is based on a Cantor-like set of numbers in base 4 whose digits are restricted to `{0, 1}`, but with additional constraints on the digits to enforce the Sidon property. The underlying Cantor set has dimension `log(2)/log(4) = 1/2`, and the extra constraints are carefully chosen so as not to reduce the dimension.\n\nSince there exists a Sidon set with dimension 1/2, the maximum possible dimension must be at least 1/2.\n\n### Step 4: Combine the results and conclude\n\nFrom Step 2, we have an upper bound: `dim_H(A) ≤ 1/2` for any Sidon set `A ⊆ [0, 1]`.\nFrom Step 3, we know this upper bound is achievable: there exists a Sidon set `A₀` with `dim_H(A₀) = 1/2`.\n\nCombining these two facts, we can conclude that the maximum Hausdorff dimension of a Sidon set in `[0, 1]` is exactly 1/2.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   It is crucial to use the combinatorial definition of a Sidon set, as this is standard in number theory and for sets of real numbers. There are other notions, like \"Sidon sets of integers\" in harmonic analysis, which are different concepts.\n*   One might encounter older or conflicting claims, some attributed to J.-P. Kahane, suggesting that Sidon sets with dimensions arbitrarily close to 1 could exist. These claims often refer to different concepts or are based on unpublished work, whereas the `1/2` result is rigorously proven and published.\n\nFinal Answer Summary:\n1.  The Sidon property imposes a strong structural constraint on a set.\n2.  T. Keleti proved that this constraint limits the Hausdorff dimension of any Sidon set in `ℝ` to be at most `1/2`.\n3.  R. Tesoro constructed a specific Sidon set in `[0, 1]` whose Hausdorff dimension is exactly `1/2`.\n4.  Therefore, the maximum is `1/2`.\n\n<<<0.5>>>"
