    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understanding the Question:**\n    The question asks for the \"exact number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori\" of a reductive group $G$ of type $E_8$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$.\n    In the context of algebraic groups, \"number of\" a certain type of subgroup (like maximal tori) is almost always understood to mean the number of **conjugacy classes** of such subgroups under the action of the rational points of the group, $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$. If the question meant the absolute total number of such subgroups, the answer would be a complex polynomial in $q$. The phrasing \"the exact number\" suggests a constant integer, independent of $q$, which reinforces the interpretation of counting conjugacy classes.\n\n2.  **Relating Tori to the Weyl Group:**\n    There is a fundamental theorem in the theory of reductive groups over a field $k$. Let $G$ be a connected reductive group over $k$. The $G(k)$-conjugacy classes of maximal tori defined over $k$ are in one-to-one correspondence with the Galois cohomology set $H^1(\\text{Gal}(\\bar{k}/k), W)$, where $W$ is the Weyl group of $G$.\n    When the field is a finite field $k = \\mathbb{F}_q$, the Galois group $\\text{Gal}(\\overline{\\mathbb{F}_q}/\\mathbb{F}_q)$ is topologically generated by the Frobenius automorphism $F$. The cohomology set $H^1(F, W)$ is the set of so-called **$F$-conjugacy classes** in the Weyl group $W$. An $F$-conjugacy class of an element $w \\in W$ is the set $\\{g^{-1}wF(g) \\mid g \\in W\\}$.\n\n3.  **Analyzing the Group G of Type E_8 over F_q:**\n    A reductive group over a non-algebraically closed field can have different \"forms\" (or \"twists\") that become isomorphic over the algebraic closure. These forms are classified by the action of the Galois group on the Dynkin diagram of the group.\n    *   The Dynkin diagram of type $E_8$ has a trivial automorphism group. This means that there are no \"outer\" automorphisms of the group $G$. Consequently, all forms of $E_8$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ are \"inner twists\" of the split form.\n    *   A theorem of Steinberg states that for a connected linear algebraic group $H$ over a finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$, the Galois cohomology set $H^1(\\mathbb{F}_q, H)$ is trivial. Applying this to the adjoint group $G_{\\text{ad}}$, we find that $H^1(\\mathbb{F}_q, G_{\\text{ad}})$ is trivial. This implies that all inner forms of $G$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ are isomorphic to each other.\n    *   Therefore, up to isomorphism, there is only one reductive group of type $E_8$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$: the **split form**.\n\n4.  **Frobenius Action on the Weyl Group:**\n    For a split group over $\\mathbb{F}_q$, the associated Frobenius morphism $F$ acts trivially on the root datum, and therefore acts trivially on the Weyl group $W$.\n    *   This means that for any element $w \\in W$, we have $F(w) = w$.\n\n5.  **Counting the Conjugacy Classes:**\n    With a trivial Frobenius action ($F(w) = w$), the definition of an $F$-conjugacy class simplifies:\n    *   The $F$-conjugacy class of $w$ is $\\{g^{-1}wF(g) \\mid g \\in W\\} = \\{g^{-1}wg \\mid g \\in W\\}$.\n    *   This is precisely the definition of the ordinary **conjugacy class** of $w$ in the group $W$.\n    *   Therefore, the number of $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$-conjugacy classes of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori is equal to the number of ordinary conjugacy classes in the Weyl group $W(E_8)$.\n\n6.  **Finding the Number of Conjugacy Classes of W(E_8):**\n    The problem is now reduced to a question about the finite Coxeter group $W(E_8)$. This is a well-known result in computational group theory and representation theory. The number of conjugacy classes for Weyl groups of exceptional Lie types are standard tabulated values.\n    *   The number of conjugacy classes in $W(E_6)$ is 25.\n    *   The number of conjugacy classes in $W(E_7)$ is 60.\n    *   The number of conjugacy classes in $W(E_8)$ is 112.\n\n    This result can be found in sources such as R.W. Carter's \"Finite Groups of Lie Type: Conjugacy Classes and Complex Characters\" or the Atlas of Finite Group Representations and other computational algebra systems like GAP or MAGMA.\n\n### Summary of Careful Points:\n*   The question must be interpreted as counting $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$-conjugacy classes of tori, not the absolute number of subgroups.\n*   One must establish a link between these conjugacy classes and the structure of the Weyl group $W$. The correct link is the set of $F$-conjugacy classes in $W$.\n*   It's crucial to determine the specific form of the group $E_8$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$. The triviality of the automorphism group of the $E_8$ Dynkin diagram and Steinberg's theorem simplify this, leading to the conclusion that we only need to consider the split group.\n*   For the split group, the Frobenius action on the Weyl group is trivial.\n*   A trivial Frobenius action means $F$-conjugacy classes are the same as ordinary conjugacy classes.\n*   The final step is to find the known number of conjugacy classes of the finite group $W(E_8)$.\n\nBased on this step-by-step analysis, the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori (up to $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$-conjugacy) is the number of conjugacy classes in the Weyl group $W(E_8)$.\n\nFinal Answer Acquisition:\nThe number of conjugacy classes in the Weyl group of type $E_8$ is a standard, tabulated result in mathematics. That number is 112.\n\n<<<112>>>"
