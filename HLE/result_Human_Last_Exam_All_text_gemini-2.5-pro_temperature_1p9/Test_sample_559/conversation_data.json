    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the separatrix of the given system of differential equations.\n\n**1. Understand the System and Separatrices**\n\nWe are given the system:\n$$d'(t)=2d^2(t)+(-3u(t)+5u^2(t))d(t)-u(t)^3(1-u(t))$$\n$$u'(t)=(u(t)-1)u^2(t)$$\nThe analysis is restricted to the upper half-plane, $u \\geq 0$.\n\nA separatrix is a curve in the phase plane that separates trajectories with different long-term behaviors. Separatrices are typically the stable and unstable manifolds of saddle points.\n\n**2. Find the Equilibrium Points**\n\nEquilibrium points occur where $d'(t) = 0$ and $u'(t) = 0$.\nFirst, solve $u'(t) = 0$:\n$$(u-1)u^2 = 0 \\implies u=0 \\text{ or } u=1$$\n\nNow, substitute these values of $u$ into the equation for $d'(t) = 0$.\n\n*   **Case 1: u = 0**\n    $d' = 2d^2 + (-3(0)+5(0)^2)d - 0^3(1-0) = 2d^2 = 0 \\implies d=0$.\n    This gives the equilibrium point **(0, 0)**.\n\n*   **Case 2: u = 1**\n    $d' = 2d^2 + (-3(1)+5(1)^2)d - 1^3(1-1) = 2d^2 + 2d = 2d(d+1) = 0 \\implies d=0 \\text{ or } d=-1$.\n    This gives the equilibrium points **(0, 1)** and **(-1, 1)**.\n\nSo, the equilibrium points are (0, 0), (0, 1), and (-1, 1).\n\n**3. Classify the Equilibrium Points using Linearization**\n\nWe compute the Jacobian matrix $J(d, u)$:\nLet $F(d,u) = 2d^2 + (-3u + 5u^2)d - u^3 + u^4$ and $G(d,u) = u^3 - u^2$.\n$$J(d, u) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial d} & \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial u} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial d} & \\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial u} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 4d - 3u + 5u^2 & (-3 + 10u)d - 3u^2 + 4u^3 \\\\ 0 & 3u^2 - 2u \\end{pmatrix}$$\n\n*   **At (0, 1):**\n    $$J(0, 1) = \\begin{pmatrix} 4(0) - 3(1) + 5(1)^2 & (-3 + 10(1))(0) - 3(1)^2 + 4(1)^3 \\\\ 0 & 3(1)^2 - 2(1) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$$\n    The eigenvalues are the diagonal entries, $\\lambda_1 = 2$ and $\\lambda_2 = 1$. Since both are positive, **(0, 1) is an unstable node (a source)**.\n\n*   **At (-1, 1):**\n    $$J(-1, 1) = \\begin{pmatrix} 4(-1) - 3(1) + 5(1)^2 & (-3 + 10(1))(-1) - 3(1)^2 + 4(1)^3 \\\\ 0 & 3(1)^2 - 2(1) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -2 & -6 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$$\n    The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1 = -2$ and $\\lambda_2 = 1$. Since they are real and have opposite signs, **(-1, 1) is a saddle point**.\n\n*   **At (0, 0):**\n    $J(0,0)$ is the zero matrix. Linearization is inconclusive. This point is non-hyperbolic.\n\n**4. Find the Manifolds of the Saddle Point**\n\nThe separatrices are the stable and unstable manifolds associated with the saddle point (-1, 1).\n\n*   **Stable Manifold (for $\\lambda_1 = -2$):**\n    The eigenvector $v_s$ is found from $(J - \\lambda_1 I)v_s = 0$.\n    $$\\begin{pmatrix} -2 - (-2) & -6 \\\\ 0 & 1 - (-2) \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\\\ v_2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -6 \\\\ 0 & 3 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\\\ v_2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$$\n    This implies $-6v_2 = 0$, so $v_2 = 0$. We can choose $v_1=1$. The eigenvector is $v_s = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$. This vector is horizontal, so the stable manifold is tangent to the line $u=1$ at the point (-1, 1). In fact, the line $u=1$ is an invariant manifold of the system. This line is one separatrix.\n\n*   **Unstable Manifold (for $\\lambda_2 = 1$):**\n    The eigenvector $v_u$ is found from $(J - \\lambda_2 I)v_u = 0$.\n    $$\\begin{pmatrix} -2 - 1 & -6 \\\\ 0 & 1 - 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\\\ v_2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -3 & -6 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\\\ v_2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$$\n    This implies $-3v_1 - 6v_2 = 0$, or $v_1 = -2v_2$. We can choose $v_2 = -1$, so $v_1 = 2$. The eigenvector is $v_u = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    The unstable manifold leaves the saddle point (-1, 1) tangent to this vector.\n\n**5. Determine the Equation of the Unstable Manifold**\n\nWe look for an invariant curve (a trajectory) that passes through (-1, 1) and has the correct tangent. Let's test if a simple algebraic curve of the form $d=f(u)$ is a solution. A good candidate must pass through `(-1, 1)`. Let's test the parabolic curve $d = -u^2$.\n1.  **Check if it passes through the saddle point:** At $u=1$, $d = -(1)^2 = -1$. So the curve $d=-u^2$ passes through (-1, 1).\n2.  **Check if it is an invariant curve:** An invariant curve satisfies the system's dynamics. If $d(t) = -[u(t)]^2$, then by the chain rule, $d'(t) = -2u(t) u'(t)$. We must check if this relation holds when we substitute the original differential equations for $d'$ and $u'$.\n\n    LHS: $d' = 2d^2 + (-3u+5u^2)d - u^3(1-u)$. Substituting $d = -u^2$:\n    $d' = 2(-u^2)^2 + (-3u+5u^2)(-u^2) - (u^3-u^4)$\n    $d' = 2u^4 + (3u^3 - 5u^4) - u^3 + u^4$\n    $d' = (2-5+1)u^4 + (3-1)u^3 = -2u^4 + 2u^3$\n\n    RHS: $-2u u' = -2u((u-1)u^2) = -2u(u^3-u^2) = -2u^4+2u^3$\n\n    Since LHS = RHS, the curve $d = -u^2$ is an invariant manifold. As it passes through the saddle point, it must be the unstable manifold (since it's not the line $u=1$).\n\nThis curve $d=-u^2$ connects the saddle point $(-1,1)$ to the equilibrium point $(0,0)$. This curve separates the phase plane into regions of different dynamic behavior, and is therefore the other separatrix. Usually, when asked for \"the\" separatrix in this context, the more complex, non-linear one is expected.\n\nThe separatrix is the curve defined by the equation $d = -u^2$.\n\n<<<d = -u^2>>>"
