    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the novel and author Borges was referencing.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Clues:** The question provides two distinct and powerful clues:\n    *   **The Quote:** A description of a novel (or novels) having \"the intensity of a tiger and the variety that a chess duel can achieve.\" This suggests a work that is both viscerally powerful and intellectually complex.\n    *   **The Author Description:** The author is referred to as a \"continuator (and simplifier) of Faulkner.\" This points to a 20th-century writer influenced by William Faulkner's narrative techniques (like complex timelines or the creation of a mythical, self-contained fictional territory) but perhaps with a more direct or less ornate prose style.\n\n2.  **Identify the Author:** The description of a \"continuator (and simplifier) of Faulkner\" is a well-known assessment that Borges made of the Uruguayan writer **Juan Carlos Onetti**. Borges saw Onetti's creation of the mythical city of Santa María as a parallel to Faulkner's Yoknapatawpha County, establishing Onetti as a foundational figure in modern Latin American literature who adapted and built upon Faulkner's legacy.\n\n3.  **Locate the Source Text:** With the author identified as Onetti, the next step is to find where Borges wrote the specific quote about the \"tiger\" and \"chess.\" The quote and the author description both appear in the same text: the **prologue that Jorge Luis Borges wrote for *Un sueño realizado y otros cuentos* (*A Dream Come True and Other Stories*)**, a collection of Onetti's stories. This prologue was written for the \"Biblioteca Personal\" (\"Personal Library\") series that Borges curated in the 1980s.\n\n4.  **Identify the Novel(s):** In this prologue, Borges praises Onetti's entire body of work. When he uses the \"tiger and chess\" metaphor, he is not referring to the short story collection itself but is reflecting on what he considers to be Onetti's masterpieces. Borges explicitly states (translated from Spanish):\n\n    > \"I think of *The Shipyard* (*El astillero*) and of **Body Snatcher** (*Juntacadáveres*), which have the intensity of a tiger and the variety that a chess duel can achieve.\"\n\n    Therefore, Borges applies this high praise to two of Onetti's most famous novels.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Author:** The author is definitively Juan Carlos Onetti.\n*   **Source:** The source is Borges's prologue to a collection of Onetti's *short stories*, not a prologue to the novels themselves. In it, he discusses Onetti's work more broadly.\n*   **Plural vs. Singular:** The question asks for \"Which novel\" (singular), but Borges's original quote explicitly names **two** novels: *El astillero* (*The Shipyard*) and *Juntacadáveres* (*Body Snatcher*). Both are correct answers.\n*   **Common Association:** While both novels are mentioned, *Juntacadáveres* is very frequently cited in connection with this specific praise from Borges and is one of Onetti's most celebrated works within the Santa María cycle.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe author is Juan Carlos Onetti. Borges uses the quote to refer to two of his novels. Of the two, *Juntacadáveres* is a quintessential example that fits the description perfectly.\n\n<<<Juntacadáveres (Body Snatcher)>>>"
