    "This is a fascinating question of counter-factual historical linguistics. To determine the most likely Modern English word for \"sister\" without Norse influence, we must trace the path of the native Old English word through the centuries.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the current word's origin:** The Modern English word \"sister\" is not a direct descendant of the native Old English word. It comes from the Middle English word *sister*, which was borrowed directly from the Old Norse word *systir*. The Vikings, who spoke Old Norse, introduced this word, and its 's' and hard 'k'-like sound (represented by the 't' in Old Norse and the second 's' in Middle English) eventually displaced the native English form.\n\n2.  **Identify the native Old English word:** The original Anglo-Saxon (Old English) word for a female sibling was **sweoster** (pronounced roughly \"SWEH-os-ter\"). This word, like the Old Norse *systir*, descended from a common ancestor, the Proto-Germanic word **\\*swestÄ“r**.\n\n3.  **Establish the counter-factual premise:** In a history where the Norse never invaded or settled in England, the Old Norse word *systir* would never have entered the English vocabulary. Therefore, the native word, *sweoster*, would have continued its natural evolution into Middle and then Modern English.\n\n4.  **Trace the likely evolution of \"sweoster\":** We can predict its path by observing how similarly structured Old English words changed over time.\n\n    *   **Old English to Middle English:** The vowel cluster \"eo\" in *sweoster* was a short diphthong. In the transition to Middle English, such short diphthongs typically smoothed into a simple short vowel, usually /e/ (as in \"bed\").\n        *   Compare OE *heorte* -> ME *herte* (heart).\n        *   Compare OE *feoh* -> ME *fe* (fee).\n        *   Following this pattern, OE *sweoster* would have become **swester** in Middle English.\n\n    *   **Middle English to Modern English:** The word *swester* would have then undergone further changes.\n        *   **Vowel Sounds:** The stressed vowel is a short /e/. The Great Vowel Shift, which dramatically altered English pronunciation between 1400 and 1700, primarily affected long vowels. Therefore, the short /e/ sound in *swester* would likely have remained stable, just as it did in words like \"bed,\" \"fetch,\" and \"hem.\"\n        *   **Consonant Sounds:** The \"sw-\" cluster at the beginning is stable in English (e.g., \"swear,\" \"sweet\"). The \"-st-\" in the middle is also stable.\n        *   **Ending:** The \"-er\" ending is very common and stable in English (e.g., \"brother,\" \"mother,\" \"father\").\n\n5.  **Conclusion on the final form:** Based on the standard rules of phonetic evolution from Old English, the word *sweoster* would have evolved into **swester**. The spelling and pronunciation would be very straightforward, rhyming with words like \"jester\" or \"tester.\" This word actually survived in some dialects for centuries, but was pushed out of the standard language by the Norse-derived \"sister.\"\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n*   **Counter-factual Nature:** This is an educated prediction. Language evolution can be unpredictable, but this is the most likely outcome based on known patterns.\n*   **Analogy:** The word might have been influenced by analogy with *brother*. However, since both would end in \"-er\" and share a similar familial context, this would likely reinforce the predicted *swester* form rather than change it.\n*   **Norman French Influence:** The Norman Conquest also had a massive impact, but it's unlikely a common Germanic word for a core family member would have been replaced by a Latin-derived French equivalent.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nFollowing the natural linguistic path from the native Old English word *sweoster*, without the influence of the Old Norse *systir*, the Modern English word for \"sister\" would most likely be **swester**.\n\n<<<swester>>>"
