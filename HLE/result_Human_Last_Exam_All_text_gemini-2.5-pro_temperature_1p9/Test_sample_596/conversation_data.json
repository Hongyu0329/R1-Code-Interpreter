    "This question asks for the number of \"higher dimensional rooted forests\" on a specific simplicial complex (the standard triangulation of a Möbius band) that have a certain topological property (failing to collapse to the root). To solve this, we need to carefully define the objects in question and then apply a relevant counting theorem from algebraic combinatorics.\n\n**Step 1: Analyzing the Object \"Higher Dimensional Rooted Forest\"**\n\nThe term \"higher dimensional rooted forest\" suggests a generalization of spanning trees or forests from graphs to simplicial complexes. There are several non-equivalent definitions in the literature. A particularly powerful and relevant definition is that of a \"d-spanning tree\" (or \"d-tree\") for a d-dimensional simplicial complex K. This concept arises in the context of higher-dimensional matrix-tree theorems.\n\nA **d-spanning tree** of a d-complex K is a d-dimensional subcomplex T that satisfies certain properties. A common definition requires:\n1.  T contains the full (d-1)-skeleton of K, denoted $K^{(d-1)}$.\n2.  The (d-1)-th homology group of T, $H_{d-1}(T)$, is torsion-free.\n\nThe term \"rooted\" can be interpreted in several ways, but in some advanced contexts, the property of having torsion-free homology serves as a high-dimensional analogue of being \"rooted\" or \"acyclic\". Let's assume this is the intended definition. A \"forest\" would then be a collection of such trees on components of a complex, but since the Möbius band is connected, we are concerned with a single tree.\n\n**Step 2: Identifying the Simplicial Complex and its Properties**\n\nThe question specifies K as the \"standard triangulation of the Möbius band\". A Möbius band is a 2-dimensional surface, so we are dealing with a 2-complex (d=2). Its key topological properties, which are independent of the specific triangulation, are its homology groups over the integers $\\mathbb{Z}$:\n*   $H_0(K, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$ (it's connected).\n*   $H_1(K, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$ (it has one essential \"loop\", its centerline).\n*   $H_2(K, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong 0$ (it has no volume and is non-orientable).\n\nThe crucial part for our analysis is the first homology group, $H_1(K, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\n**Step 3: Applying the Higher-Dimensional Matrix-Tree Theorem**\n\nA fundamental result in algebraic combinatorics, generalizing the famous matrix-tree theorem for graphs, counts the number of d-spanning trees in a d-complex. The theorem, due to the work of Adin, Kalai, Lyons, and Duval-Klivans-Martin, states:\n\nThe number of d-spanning trees in a d-complex K, denoted $t_d(K)$, is given by the square of the order of the torsion subgroup of its (d-1)-th homology group:\n$t_d(K) = |\\text{Tor } H_{d-1}(K, \\mathbb{Z})|^2$\n\nFor our problem:\n*   K is the triangulation of the Möbius band.\n*   The dimension is d=2.\n*   We need to find the number of 2-spanning trees, $t_2(K)$.\n*   The formula requires us to look at the torsion subgroup of $H_{2-1}(K, \\mathbb{Z}) = H_1(K, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\nAs stated in Step 2, $H_1(K, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$. The group of integers is torsion-free. This means its torsion subgroup consists only of the identity element, $\\{0\\}$. The order (size) of this trivial group is 1.\n\nApplying the theorem:\n$t_2(K) = |\\text{Tor}(\\mathbb{Z})|^2 = |\\{0\\}|^2 = 1^2 = 1$.\n\nThis stunning result means there is exactly **one** \"higher dimensional forest\" (2-spanning tree) for the Möbius band.\n\n**Step 4: Analyzing the Collapse Property**\n\nNow we must check if this unique forest F fails to collapse onto its root R.\n*   What is F? A 2-spanning tree F must contain the entire 1-skeleton $K^{(1)}$ and be a subcomplex of K such that $H_1(F)$ is torsion-free. Let's consider the entire complex K itself. F = K. It contains $K^{(1)}$. Its first homology group is $H_1(K) = \\mathbb{Z}$, which is torsion-free. Since the theorem guarantees there is only one 2-spanning tree, it must be that F is the entire complex K itself.\n*   What is R? A \"root\" R is typically a vertex or a simple subcomplex.\n*   Does F collapse to R? The forest F is the simplicial complex of the Möbius band itself. A simplicial complex can only be simplicially collapsed to a subcomplex R if it deformation retracts to R. If we take R to be a point (a single vertex), collapsing to R implies the complex is contractible.\n*   The Möbius band is not contractible. Its first homology group ($H_1(M) = \\mathbb{Z}$) is non-trivial, so it cannot be collapsed to a point.\n\nTherefore, the unique higher-dimensional forest F fails to simplicially collapse onto a root R.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion**\n\nWe are asked for the number of such forests that fail to collapse.\n1.  We established that under a standard and powerful definition from algebraic combinatorics, there is exactly one \"higher dimensional forest\" for the standard triangulation of the Möbius band.\n2.  We showed that this unique forest is the triangulation of the Möbius band itself.\n3.  This complex is not contractible and therefore fails to collapse.\n\nSo, there is exactly one such object, and it has the property of failing to collapse. The number of such objects is 1."
