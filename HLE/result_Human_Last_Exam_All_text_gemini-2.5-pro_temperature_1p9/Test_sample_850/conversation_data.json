    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the crystal classes that are achiral, non-polar, and have the correct symmetry for optical activity.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Symmetry Requirement for Optical Activity\n\nOptical activity is the phenomenon where a material rotates the plane of linearly polarized light. The possibility of this effect is determined by the material's crystal structure, specifically its point group symmetry.\n\n*   **Symmetry Rule:** A crystal class is optically active if, and only if, its point group symmetry does not include a center of inversion (`i`, also denoted `overline{1}`) or a mirror plane (`m`, also denoted `overline{2}`).\n*   There are 32 crystallographic point groups. 11 are centrosymmetric (contain `i`) and are thus not optically active. Of the remaining 21 non-centrosymmetric classes, 9 contain mirror planes (`m`).\n*   This leaves 12 classes that are optically active: `1`, `2`, `222`, `3`, `32`, `4`, `422`, `6`, `622`, `23`, `432`, and `overline{4}`.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Symmetry Requirement for being Achiral\n\nChirality refers to an object or structure that is not superimposable on its mirror image. In crystallography, a chiral crystal class is one that does not possess any roto-inversion symmetry operations.\n\n*   **Symmetry Rule:** A crystal class is **achiral** if its point group contains at least one roto-inversion axis (`overline{n}`). Roto-inversion operations include the center of inversion (`overline{1}` or `i`), the mirror plane (`overline{2}` or `m`), and higher-order roto-inversions (`overline{3}`, `overline{4}`, `overline{6}`).\n*   A crystal class is **chiral** if it lacks all such operations. The 11 chiral classes are `1`, `2`, `222`, `3`, `32`, `4`, `422`, `6`, `622`, `23`, and `432`.\n\n### Step 3: Combine the Conditions for \"Achiral\" and \"Optically Active\"\n\nWe need to find crystal classes that satisfy both conditions simultaneously.\n*   From Step 1, the class must not have `i` or `m`.\n*   From Step 2, the class must be achiral, meaning it must have a roto-inversion axis (`overline{n}`).\n\nLet's reconcile these two rules: The crystal class must possess a roto-inversion axis (`overline{3}`, `overline{4}`, or `overline{6}`), but this symmetry element cannot be, or imply the existence of, a center of inversion (`i`) or a mirror plane (`m`).\n\nLet's examine the relevant point groups:\n*   Groups with `overline{3}` symmetry: `overline{3}` and `overline{3}m`. The point group `overline{3}` is equivalent to a 3-fold axis plus a center of inversion (`3 + i`). Since it has an inversion center, it is not optically active. The point group `overline{3}m` contains mirror planes, so it is also not optically active.\n*   Groups with `overline{6}` symmetry: `overline{6}` and `overline{6}m2`. The operation `overline{6}` is equivalent to a 3-fold rotation followed by a reflection in a plane perpendicular to the axis (`3/m`). Since it contains a mirror plane, it is not optically active. The point group `overline{6}m2` also contains mirror planes and is not optically active.\n*   Groups with `overline{4}` symmetry: `overline{4}`, `overline{4}2m`, and `overline{4}3m`. The `overline{4}` operation itself does not imply an inversion center or a mirror plane.\n    *   The class **`overline{4}`** (Schoenflies notation `S₄`) has symmetry elements {E, `overline{4}`, 2, (`overline{4}`)³}. It does not have an inversion center or a mirror plane. Therefore, it is **optically active** and **achiral**.\n    *   The classes `overline{4}2m` and `overline{4}3m` both contain mirror planes (`m`) in addition to the `overline{4}` axis. Therefore, they are not optically active.\n\nConclusion of this step: The only crystal class that is both achiral and optically active is `overline{4}`.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the Symmetry Requirement for being Non-polar\n\nA crystal class is polar if there is at least one direction in the crystal that has different properties from its opposite direction, and this direction is not related to an equivalent direction by any symmetry operation.\n\n*   **Symmetry Rule:** A crystal class is **non-polar** if it is not one of the 10 polar crystal classes.\n*   The 10 polar crystal classes are: `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, `6`, `m`, `mm2`, `3m`, `4mm`, `6mm`.\n\n### Step 5: Apply the Non-polar Condition to the Candidate Class\n\nWe have one candidate class from Step 3: `overline{4}`. We must now check if it is non-polar.\n\n*   Is the point group `overline{4}` in the list of 10 polar classes? No.\n*   Therefore, the class `overline{4}` is **non-polar**.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nBy analyzing all three conditions step-by-step, we find that there is only one crystal class that satisfies all criteria.\n1.  **Optically Active**: Class `overline{4}` has no `i` or `m`. (✓)\n2.  **Achiral**: Class `overline{4}` possesses a `overline{4}` roto-inversion axis. (✓)\n3.  **Non-polar**: Class `overline{4}` is not one of the 10 polar classes. (✓)\n\nThe only crystal class that is achiral, non-polar, and has the correct symmetry for optical activity is `overline{4}`.\n\n<<<overline{4}>>>"
