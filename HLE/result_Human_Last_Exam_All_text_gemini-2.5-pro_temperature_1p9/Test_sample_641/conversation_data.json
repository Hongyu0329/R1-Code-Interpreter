    "An involution in a group G is an element `x` such that `x^2 = 1` and `x \\neq 1`. We want to find the number of such elements in the projective special unitary group `G = PSU(4, 997)`.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine this number.\n\n### Step 1: Relate involutions in PSU(n, q) to elements in SU(n, q)\n\nThe group `PSU(n, q)` is the quotient group `SU(n, q) / Z(SU(n, q))`, where `SU(n, q)` is the special unitary group and `Z = Z(SU(n, q))` is its center. Let's denote `SU(4, 997)` by `\\bar{G}`. An element of `G` is a coset `gZ`, where `g \\in \\bar{G}`.\n\nThe identity element in `G` is the coset `Z`. An element `gZ` is an involution if it is not the identity and its square is the identity:\n1.  `gZ \\neq Z \\implies g \\notin Z`\n2.  `(gZ)^2 = Z \\implies g^2 Z = Z \\implies g^2 \\in Z`\n\nSo, we need to count the number of cosets `gZ` where `g \\in \\bar{G} \\setminus Z` and `g^2 \\in Z`.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the center Z(SU(4, 997))\n\nThe center of `SU(n, q)` consists of scalar matrices `\\lambda I` such that `\\lambda^n = 1` (since they are in `SU(n,q)`) and `\\lambda^{q+1} = 1` (since they are in `U(n,q)`). The second condition `(\\lambda I)^* (\\lambda I) = \\lambda^q \\lambda I = \\lambda^{q+1}I = I` implies `\\lambda^{q+1} = 1`. Thus, `\\lambda` must be a `d`-th root of unity, where `d = gcd(n, q+1)`.\n\nFor our case, `n = 4` and `q = 997`.\n`d = gcd(4, 997 + 1) = gcd(4, 998)`.\nSince `998 = 2 \\times 499` and 499 is prime, `gcd(4, 998) = 2`.\nSo, the center `Z` has order 2. It consists of scalar matrices `\\lambda I` with `\\lambda^2 = 1`, which means `\\lambda = \\pm 1`.\n`Z = \\{I, -I\\}`.\n\n### Step 3: Classify elements `g \\in SU(4, 997)` such that `g^2 \\in Z`\n\nThe condition `g^2 \\in Z` means `g^2 = I` or `g^2 = -I`. The matrix `g` is in `SU(4, 997)`, so it is unitary and has determinant 1. As a unitary matrix, `g` is diagonalizable over `\\mathbb{F}_{997^2}`.\n\n**Case A: `g^2 = -I`**\nThe minimal polynomial of `g` must divide `x^2 + 1`. So, the eigenvalues of `g` must be roots of `x^2 + 1 = 0`. Let these be `i` and `-i`, where `i^2 = -1`.\nSince `q = 997` and `997 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}`, the roots `i, -i` are in the base field `\\mathbb{F}_{997}`.\nHowever, for a matrix `g` to be unitary, its eigenvalues `\\mu` must satisfy the condition `\\mu^{q+1} = 1`.\nLet's check this for `\\mu = i`:\n`i^{q+1} = i^{998} = (i^2)^{499} = (-1)^{499} = -1`.\nSince `i^{997+1} = -1 \\neq 1`, `i` cannot be an eigenvalue for any matrix in `U(n, 997)`. This seems to imply no such `g` exists.\n\nA more detailed analysis shows that eigenspaces `V_\\mu` where `\\mu^{q+1} \\neq 1` must be totally isotropic. In our case `V_i` and `V_{-i}` are totally isotropic subspaces. For such a unitary matrix to exist, the whole space `V` must be a direct sum of two totally isotropic subspaces, `V=V_i \\oplus V_{-i}`. This is possible and `det(g)=i^k(-i)^{4-k}=1` implies k must be 2. So we have eigenvalues `{i,i,-i,-i}`. Such elements exist and form a single conjugacy class in `SU(4, q)`. The centralizer in `U(4, q)` is isomorphic to `GL(2, q^2)`.\nThe number of such elements is `N_1 = |SU(4,q)|/|C_{SU(4,q)}(g)|`. The centralizer size is `|C_{SU(4,q)}(g)| = |SL(2,q^2)|(q-1) = q^2(q^4-1)(q-1)`.\nSo, the number of such elements is:\n`N_1 = \\frac{q^6(q^2-1)(q^3+1)(q^4-1)}{q^2(q^4-1)(q-1)} = q^4(q+1)(q^3+1) = q^4(q+1)^2(q^2-q+1)`.\n\n**Case B: `g^2 = I`**\nHere, `g` is an involution. Its eigenvalues can only be `1` or `-1`.\nLet `k` be the multiplicity of the eigenvalue `-1`.\nSince `g \\in SU(4, q)`, its determinant is 1. `det(g) = (-1)^k = 1`. This means `k` must be even.\nThe possible values for `k` are 0, 2, 4.\n*   `k=0`: Eigenvalues are `(1,1,1,1)`. This means `g = I`. This element is in `Z`.\n*   `k=4`: Eigenvalues are `(-1,-1,-1,-1)`. This means `g = -I`. This element is in `Z`.\n*   `k=2`: Eigenvalues are `(1,1,-1,-1)`. `g` is not a scalar matrix, so `g \\notin Z`. These are the elements we need to count.\n\nThese elements form a single conjugacy class in `SU(4,q)`. The centralizer of such an element in `U(4,q)` is `U(2,q) \\times U(2,q)`.\nThe number of such elements, `N_2`, is `|SU(4,q)|/|C_{SU(4,q)}(g)|`.\n`|C_{SU(4,q)}(g)| = |U(2,q)|^2 / (q+1) = q^2(q+1)(q^2-1)^2`.\nSo, `N_2 = \\frac{q^6(q^2-1)(q^3+1)(q^4-1)}{q^2(q+1)(q^2-1)^2} = q^4(q^2-q+1)(q^2+1)`.\n\n### Step 4: Count the number of involutions in PSU(4, 997)\n\nThe elements `g \\in SU(4,997) \\setminus Z` with `g^2 \\in Z` are of two types, as calculated above. Let `T_1` be the set of elements from Case A (`g^2 = -I`) and `T_2` be the set from Case B (`g^2 = I, g \\notin Z`).\n`|T_1| = N_1 = q^4(q+1)^2(q^2-q+1)`\n`|T_2| = N_2 = q^4(q^2-q+1)(q^2+1)`\n\nThe total number of preimages of involutions is `|T| = |T_1| + |T_2|`.\n`|T| = q^4(q^2-q+1)(q+1)^2 + q^4(q^2-q+1)(q^2+1)`\n`|T| = q^4(q^2-q+1) [(q+1)^2 + (q^2+1)]`\n`|T| = q^4(q^2-q+1) [q^2+2q+1 + q^2+1]`\n`|T| = q^4(q^2-q+1) (2q^2+2q+2)`\n`|T| = 2q^4(q^2-q+1)(q^2+q+1)`\nWe can simplify the product: `(q^2-q+1)(q^2+q+1) = (q^2+1-q)(q^2+1+q) = (q^2+1)^2 - q^2 = q^4+2q^2+1-q^2 = q^4+q^2+1`.\nSo, `|T| = 2q^4(q^4+q^2+1)`.\n\nEach involution in `PSU(4, 997)` corresponds to a coset `gZ` where `g \\in T`. The set `T` is a union of such cosets. Since `Z` has order 2, each coset `gZ` contains two elements (`g` and `-g`). Both `g` and `-g` are in `T`. Therefore, the number of involutions is `|T|/|Z|`.\nNumber of involutions = `|T| / 2 = \\frac{2q^4(q^4+q^2+1)}{2} = q^4(q^4+q^2+1)`.\n\n### Step 5: Final calculation\n\nSubstituting `q = 997`:\nThe number of involutions is `997^4 (997^4 + 997^2 + 1)`."
