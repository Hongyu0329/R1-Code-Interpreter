    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the first clue.**\nThe first clue is a quote from the poet Andrei Voznesensky, who called a man \"a joy-discovering sailor\". This is a poetic metaphor. \"Sailor\" points to someone involved with exploration or sea travel. \"Joy-discovering\" suggests his work was about discovery, progress, or perhaps a romantic quest.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the second clue.**\nThe second clue is another line from Voznesensky about the same man: \"Where is your grave, even a mound?\". This tells us two critical things:\n1.  The man is deceased.\n2.  At the time the poem was written, the location of his grave was unknown or lost.\n\n**Step 3: Connect the clues to a specific work.**\nBoth of these quotes come from a famous poem by Voznesensky which became the libretto for the Russian rock opera \"Juno and Avos\" (\"Юнона и Авось\"). This opera tells the story of a real historical figure.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the historical figure.**\nThe protagonist of \"Juno and Avos\" is Count Nikolai Petrovich Rezanov, a Russian nobleman, diplomat, and one of the founders of the Russian-American Company. His story involves commanding an expedition on the ships *Juno* and *Avos* to California, which fits the \"sailor\" description. His tragic romance with Concepción Argüello can be seen as the source of the \"joy-discovering\" part of the quote.\n\n**Step 5: Verify the \"lost grave\" clue with the historical figure.**\nNikolai Rezanov died in Krasnoyarsk, Siberia, in 1807 on his journey back to St. Petersburg. He was buried there, but the cathedral and cemetery where he was laid to rest were destroyed during the Soviet era. For a long time, the exact location of his grave was lost, which perfectly matches Voznesensky's line, \"Where is your grave...?\".\n\n**Step 6: Analyze the final clue.**\nThe question states that \"The answer to this question emerged in the late 1980s.\" Fueled by the immense popularity of the rock opera, a renewed interest in Rezanov's story grew in the USSR. During the late 1980s, in the era of Glasnost, historians and local researchers in Krasnoyarsk undertook efforts to find the lost grave. They were successful in pinpointing the location where Rezanov had been buried. This discovery directly answers the poetic question posed by Voznesensky and matches the timeline given in the prompt.\n\n**Conclusion**\nAll clues point unequivocally to the Russian explorer and diplomat Nikolai Rezanov. The question asks for his last name.\n\n<<<Rezanov>>>"
