    "Answering this question involves classifying quadratic forms $Q(x,y) = ax^2 + bxy + cy^2$ where $a, b, c$ are in the ring $R = \\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$, under the action of the group $GL_2(R)$ of invertible linear transformations. Two forms $Q_1$ and $Q_2$ are equivalent if $Q_2(v) = Q_1(Pv)$ for some invertible matrix $P \\in GL_2(R)$.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n**Step 1: Partitioning the problem using an invariant**\n\nA crucial invariant for a quadratic form $Q$ under this group action is the ideal generated by its coefficients, $I(Q) = (a,b,c)$. If $Q_1 \\sim Q_2$, then $I(Q_1) = I(Q_2)$. The ideals of $\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$ are principal and form a chain: $(0) \\subset (4) \\subset (2) \\subset (1)$. This allows us to partition the set of all quadratic forms into four disjoint sets based on their content ideal. We can count the number of equivalence classes in each set.\n\n1.  **$I(Q) = (0)$**: This means $a=b=c=0$. This is the zero form, $Q=0$. It is in a class by itself. This gives **1** class.\n2.  **$I(Q) = (4)$**: The coefficients $a,b,c$ are all in $(4) = \\{0,4\\}$, and not all are 0. Any such form can be written as $Q=4Q'$, where $Q' = a'x^2+b'xy+c'y^2$ with coefficients $a',b',c' \\in \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} = \\{0,1\\}$, and not all are zero. Two such forms $4Q'_1$ and $4Q'_2$ are equivalent over $\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$ if and only if $Q'_1$ and $Q'_2$ are equivalent over $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$. The problem is thus reduced to finding the number of classes of *primitive* forms over $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$.\n3.  **$I(Q) = (2)$**: The coefficients $a,b,c$ are all in $(2) = \\{0,2,4,6\\}$, and not all are in $(4)$. Any such form can be written as $Q=2Q'$, where $Q'$ has coefficients in $\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$ that are not all even. This means $Q'$ is a *primitive* form over $\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$. The number of classes is the number of classes of primitive forms over $\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$.\n4.  **$I(Q) = (1)$**: At least one coefficient $a,b,c$ is a unit (odd). These are the *primitive* forms over $\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$. We need to count the number of classes of these forms.\n\n**Step 2: Counting primitive classes in each case**\n\n*   **Classes of primitive forms over $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$**\n    Over the field $\\mathbb{F}_2 = \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$, the non-zero quadratic forms fall into three equivalence classes, represented by:\n    1.  $x^2$ (rank 1, degenerate)\n    2.  $xy$ (rank 2, non-degenerate, hyperbolic)\n    3.  $x^2+xy+y^2$ (rank 2, non-degenerate, elliptic)\n    All non-zero forms over a field are primitive. So there are **3** classes of this type.\n\n*   **Classes of primitive forms over $\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$**\n    We classify the primitive forms $ax^2+bxy+cy^2$ over $\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$. A detailed analysis distinguishes forms based on their discriminant ($b^2-4ac$) and value sets. This yields 6 classes:\n    1.  Forms with $b$ even: A primitive form must have $a$ or $c$ as a unit. Assuming $a=1$, these are equivalent to one of $x^2+cy^2$ for $c \\in \\{0,1,2,3\\}$. These four forms are inequivalent.\n    2.  Forms with $b$ odd: Any such form is equivalent to one of $xy$ or $x^2+xy$. These two are inequivalent.\n    In total, there are $4+2 = \\textbf{6}$ classes of primitive forms over $\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n*   **Classes of primitive forms over $\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$**\n    We classify primitive forms over $\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$. The analysis is similar to the $\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$ case but more extensive.\n    1.  Forms with $b$ even: $Q = ax^2+2kxy+cy^2$. For the form to be primitive, at least one of $a, c$ must be a unit. Assume $a$ is a unit. Then we can simplify the form to $x^2+dy^2$. By testing for equivalence, it can be shown that the forms $x^2+cy^2$ are distinct for each choice of $c \\in \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\\}$. This gives **8** classes.\n    2.  Forms with $b$ odd: $Q=ax^2+bxy+cy^2$. Any such form is equivalent to one where $a$ is a unit and $b=1$. These fall into two classes based on their discriminant $D=1-4ac \\pmod 8$. The discriminant can be 1 or 5, leading to two inequivalent classes, represented by $x^2+xy$ and $x^2+xy+y^2$. This gives **2** classes.\n    In total, there are $8+2 = \\textbf{10}$ classes of primitive forms over $\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n**Step 3: Summing the counts**\n\nThe total number of equivalence classes is the sum of the counts from each case:\n*   Number of classes for $I(Q)=(0)$: 1\n*   Number of classes for $I(Q)=(4)$: 3 (from primitive forms over $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$)\n*   Number of classes for $I(Q)=(2)$: 6 (from primitive forms over $\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$)\n*   Number of classes for $I(Q)=(1)$: 10 (primitive forms over $\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$)\n\nTotal number of classes = $1 + 3 + 6 + 10 = 20$.\n\nFinal Answer Calculation:\n1.  **Zero form:** 1 class.\n2.  **Content (4):** 3 classes ($4x^2, 4xy, 4(x^2+xy+y^2)$).\n3.  **Content (2):** 6 classes ($2x^2$, $2(x^2+y^2)$, $2(x^2+2y^2)$, $2(x^2+3y^2)$, $2xy$, $2(x^2+xy)$).\n4.  **Content (1) (Primitive):** 10 classes ($x^2+cy^2$ for $c=0..7$, plus $x^2+xy$ and $x^2+xy+y^2$).\n\nTotal = $1 + 3 + 6 + 10 = 20$.\n\n<<<20>>>"
