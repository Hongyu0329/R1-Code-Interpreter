    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of power subgroups in the semidihedral group of size 512.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Question and Define the Group\nThe question asks for the number of power subgroups in the semidihedral group of size 512.\n\n1.  **Semidihedral Group of size 512**:\n    The semidihedral group of order $2^n$ (for $n \\ge 4$) is denoted as $SD_{2^n}$.\n    Since the size is 512, we have $2^n = 512$, which means $n=9$.\n    The group is $G = SD_{2^9}$.\n    Its presentation is given by:\n    $G = \\langle r, s \\mid r^{2^{n-1}} = s^2 = 1, srs = r^{2^{n-2}-1} \\rangle$\n    Substituting $n=9$:\n    $G = \\langle r, s \\mid r^{2^8} = s^2 = 1, srs = r^{2^7-1} \\rangle$\n    This means $o(r) = 2^8 = 256$, and $o(s)=2$.\n    The elements of $G$ are of the form $r^i$ or $r^is$ for $0 \\le i < 256$.\n\n2.  **Power Subgroup**:\n    A subgroup $H$ of a group $G$ is called a power subgroup if it is generated by the $k$-th powers of all elements in $G$ for some positive integer $k$. We denote this subgroup by $G[k]$.\n    $G[k] = \\langle g^k \\mid g \\in G \\rangle$.\n    Our goal is to find the number of distinct subgroups in the set $\\{G[k] \\mid k \\in \\mathbb{Z}^+\\}$.\n\n### Step 2: Compute the $k$-th Powers of Elements\nWe need to compute $g^k$ for every $g \\in G$. There are two forms of elements.\n\n1.  **Powers of $r^i$**:\n    $(r^i)^k = r^{ik}$. The set of all such powers for $i=0, \\dots, 255$ generates the subgroup $\\langle r^k \\rangle = \\langle r^{\\gcd(k, 256)} \\rangle$.\n\n2.  **Powers of $r^is$**:\n    We first find the square of $r^is$:\n    $(r^is)^2 = r^i s r^i s = r^i (srs) s^{-1} r^i s = r^i (r^{2^7-1}) s^{-1} r^i s$. This is getting complicated.\n    Let's use the relation $sr^i s^{-1} = (srs^{-1})^i = (r^{2^7-1})^i = r^{i(2^7-1)}$.\n    $(r^is)^2 = r^i(sr^is^{-1}) = r^i r^{i(2^7-1)} = r^{i(1 + 2^7-1)} = r^{i \\cdot 2^7} = r^{128i}$.\n    With this, we can compute $(r^is)^k$:\n    *   If $k$ is even (let $k=2j$):\n        $(r^is)^k = ((r^is)^2)^j = (r^{128i})^j = r^{128ij} = r^{i \\cdot (k/2) \\cdot 128} = r^{64ik}$.\n    *   If $k$ is odd (let $k=2j+1$):\n        $(r^is)^k = ((r^is)^2)^j (r^is) = (r^{128i})^j (r^is) = r^{128ij}r^is = r^{i(128j+1)}s$.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Power Subgroups $G[k]$\nWe now determine the structure of $G[k]$ by considering the parity of $k$.\n\n**Case 1: $k$ is odd**\nThe generators of $G[k]$ are $\\{(r^i)^k\\}_{i=0..255}$ and $\\{(r^is)^k\\}_{i=0..255}$.\n*   The first set generates $\\langle r^k \\rangle = \\langle r^{\\gcd(k, 256)} \\rangle$. Since $k$ is odd, $\\gcd(k, 256)=1$. So, this part generates $\\langle r \\rangle$.\n*   The second set consists of elements of the form $r^J s$. For example, taking $i=1$, we get $(rs)^k \\in G[k]$, which is an element of the form $r^J s$.\n\nSo, $G[k]$ contains the entire cyclic subgroup $\\langle r \\rangle$ and at least one element not in $\\langle r \\rangle$ (e.g., $(rs)^k$). Any subgroup of $G$ that properly contains $\\langle r \\rangle$ must be $G$ itself. Therefore, for any odd $k$, $G[k]=G$.\nThis gives us one power subgroup: $G$.\n\n**Case 2: $k$ is even**\nThe generators of $G[k]$ are $\\{(r^i)^k\\}_i$ and $\\{(r^is)^k\\}_i$.\n*   The first set generates $\\langle r^k \\rangle = \\langle r^{\\gcd(k, 256)} \\rangle$.\n*   The second set, $\\{ r^{64ik} \\}_i$, generates the subgroup $\\langle r^{64k} \\rangle = \\langle r^{\\gcd(64k, 256)} \\rangle$.\n\nSo, $G[k] = \\langle r^{\\gcd(k, 256)}, r^{\\gcd(64k, 256)} \\rangle$. Since both generators are powers of $r$, the resulting subgroup is cyclic and contained in $\\langle r \\rangle$. The generator is $r^d$, where $d=\\gcd(\\gcd(k,256), \\gcd(64k, 256)) = \\gcd(k, 64k, 256)$.\nSince $k$ is a divisor of $64k$, $\\gcd(k, 64k) = k$. So, $d=\\gcd(k, 256)$.\nThus, for any even $k$, the power subgroup is $G[k] = \\langle r^{\\gcd(k, 256)} \\rangle$.\n\n### Step 4: Count the Distinct Power Subgroups\n\n1.  From the odd values of $k$, we get exactly **one** power subgroup: $G$.\n\n2.  From the even values of $k$, we get subgroups of the form $\\langle r^d \\rangle$ where $d = \\gcd(k, 256)$ and $k$ is even.\n    Let $v_2(x)$ be the exponent of the highest power of 2 that divides $x$.\n    $d = \\gcd(k, 2^8) = 2^{\\min(v_2(k), 8)}$.\n    Since $k$ is even, $v_2(k)$ can be any integer $\\ge 1$.\n    The possible values for $\\min(v_2(k), 8)$ are therefore $1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8$.\n    This leads to the following distinct subgroups:\n    *   $v_2(k)=1$ (e.g., $k=2$): $\\langle r^2 \\rangle$\n    *   $v_2(k)=2$ (e.g., $k=4$): $\\langle r^4 \\rangle$\n    *   $v_2(k)=3$ (e.g., $k=8$): $\\langle r^8 \\rangle$\n    *   $v_2(k)=4$ (e.g., $k=16$): $\\langle r^{16} \\rangle$\n    *   $v_2(k)=5$ (e.g., $k=32$): $\\langle r^{32} \\rangle$\n    *   $v_2(k)=6$ (e.g., $k=64$): $\\langle r^{64} \\rangle$\n    *   $v_2(k)=7$ (e.g., $k=128$): $\\langle r^{128} \\rangle$\n    *   $v_2(k) \\ge 8$ (e.g., $k=256$): $\\langle r^{256} \\rangle = \\{1\\}$ (the trivial subgroup)\n\n    There are **8** distinct subgroups arising from even values of $k$.\n\nThese 8 subgroups are all cyclic (and therefore abelian), whereas the subgroup $G$ from the odd $k$ case is non-abelian. Thus, the two sets of subgroups are disjoint.\n\nTotal number of power subgroups = (Subgroups from odd $k$) + (Subgroups from even $k$) = $1 + 8 = 9$.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe distinct power subgroups of the semidihedral group of size 512 ($SD_{2^9}$) are the group $G$ itself, and the 8 cyclic subgroups $\\langle r^2 \\rangle, \\langle r^4 \\rangle, \\dots, \\langle r^{256} \\rangle = \\{1\\}$. This gives a total of 9 power subgroups.\n\n<<<9>>>"
