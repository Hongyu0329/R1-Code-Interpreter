    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of *sissone fermes* performed by Svetlana Zakharova in the Act II Odette variation.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe core components of the query are:\n*   **Performance:** Swan Lake\n*   **Company:** Bolshoi Theatre\n*   **Year:** 2014\n*   **Choreographer:** Yuri Grigorovich\n*   **Dancer:** Svetlana Zakharova\n*   **Specific Section:** Act II, Odette's variation (solo)\n*   **Specific Step:** *Sissone ferme*\n\n**Step 2: Locate and Analyze the Performance**\nThe performance in question is the well-documented 2014 Bolshoi Ballet recording of \"Swan Lake,\" starring Svetlana Zakharova as Odette/Odile and Denis Rodkin as Prince Siegfried. The analysis requires focusing on Act II, specifically Odette's first solo variation which follows the adagio of the *pas de deux*.\n\n**Step 3: Define the Ballet Step: *Sissone Ferme***\n*   **Sissone:** A ballet jump that takes off from two feet.\n*   **Ferme:** A French term meaning \"closed.\"\n*   **Sissone Ferme:** This is a jump from two feet (typically in fifth position), landing on one foot, with the other foot quickly sliding in to close back into the fifth position. In this variation, the sissones are performed *en avant* (traveling forward). They are quick, sharp jumps that create a sense of fluttering or urgency.\n\n**Step 4: Count the Steps in the Variation**\nObserving the specified variation in the 2014 recording, we can identify the sequence where this step is performed.\n*   The variation begins with slow, expressive movements.\n*   Partway through the solo, the music builds slightly, and Odette begins a diagonal sequence of traveling jumps moving from upstage right towards downstage left.\n*   These jumps are the *sissone fermes*.\n*   By carefully counting each individual jump in this sequence, we can determine the total number.\n    1.  First sissone ferme.\n    2.  Second sissone ferme.\n    3.  Third sissone ferme.\n    4.  Fourth sissone ferme.\n    5.  Fifth sissone ferme.\n    6.  Sixth sissone ferme.\n*   Following these six jumps, Zakharova executes a connecting step and moves into the next phrase of the choreography.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n*   **Choreographic consistency:** Yuri Grigorovich's choreography is quite standardized, especially for principal roles. The number of steps in such a signature sequence is almost always fixed.\n*   **Dancer's execution:** Svetlana Zakharova is renowned for her technical precision. Her performance in the 2014 recording is considered a benchmark, and she executes the choreography as set. There are no added or omitted jumps.\n*   **Step identification:** It is crucial to correctly identify the step as a *sissone ferme* and not confuse it with other traveling jumps like *temps de cuisse* or *jet√©*. The characteristic takeoff from two feet and quick closing to fifth position confirms the step is a *sissone ferme*.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion**\nBased on the visual analysis of the specified performance, Svetlana Zakharova performs a sequence of exactly six *sissone fermes*.\n\n<<<6>>>"
