    "Answering this question requires a multi-part analysis: first, evaluating the correctness of the provided Java program, and second, if it's incorrect, determining the characteristics of an optimal C implementation.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Analysis of the Problem Statement**\n\n*   **Objective:** Compute the final value of a variable `x` which starts at 0.\n*   **Variable:** A single integer variable `x`.\n*   **Initial State:** `x = 0`.\n*   **Operations:** `++` increments `x` by 1; `--` decrements `x` by 1.\n*   **Statements:** The operations can appear before or after the variable `X`. This results in four possible valid statements:\n    1.  `++X` (increment)\n    2.  `X++` (increment)\n    3.  `--X` (decrement)\n    4.  `X--` (decrement)\n*   **Input:** An integer `n`, followed by `n` lines, each containing one of the four statements.\n*   **Output:** The final integer value of `x`.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Provided Java Program**\n\nThe core logic of the submitted program lies within its `while` loop:\n\n```java\nString test = inpt.next();\nif (test.contains(\"++X\"))\n{\n    tresult++;\n}\nif (test.contains(\"--X\"))\n{\n    tresult--;\n}\n```\n\nLet's test this logic against all four possible inputs:\n*   `test = \"++X\"`: `test.contains(\"++X\")` is **true**. `tresult` is incremented. **(Correct)**\n*   `test = \"X++\"`: `test.contains(\"++X\")` is **false**. No action is taken. **(Incorrect)**\n*   `test = \"--X\"`: `test.contains(\"--X\")` is **true**. `tresult` is decremented. **(Correct)**\n*   `test = \"X--\"`: `test.contains(\"--X\")` is **false**. No action is taken. **(Incorrect)**\n\n**Conclusion:** The Java program is **flawed**. It fails to process statements where the operator comes after the variable (`X++` and `X--`). Therefore, it does not solve the problem correctly.\n\n**3. Designing an Optimal C Solution and Calculating 'x' and 'y'**\n\nSince the program is incorrect, we must determine the properties of an optimal C solution as per the instructions.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Finding the most efficient operation check.**\n    All four statements (`++X`, `X++`, `--X`, `X--`) are three characters long. A crucial observation is that the middle character (at index 1) uniquely identifies the operation:\n    *   In `++X` and `X++`, the middle character is `+`.\n    *   In `--X` and `X--`, the middle character is `-`.\n    Therefore, the most efficient way to determine the operation is to read the statement and inspect only the character at index 1. This avoids more complex string comparisons.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Calculating `x` (smallest character comparisons).**\n    The problem asks for `x`, the smallest number of character comparisons for an input of 100 instructions. Using the efficient method described above, we perform exactly one character comparison (e.g., `is the character at index 1 a '+'?`) for each of the 100 instructions. This is the absolute minimum, as some part of each statement must be inspected to know whether to increment or decrement.\n    *   Number of comparisons = `1 comparison/instruction * 100 instructions = 100`.\n    *   **Thus, x = 100.**\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Calculating `y` (smallest memory size).**\n    The problem asks for `y`, the smallest memory size in bytes (B) needed to run the program. We must choose the smallest C data types that can hold the required values.\n    *   **Variable for `n`**: The number of statements is between 1 and 150. An `unsigned char` (range 0-255) is sufficient and uses **1 byte**.\n    *   **Variable for `x`**: The final value of `x` will be between -150 and +150. A `signed char` (range -128 to 127) is not sufficient. The next smallest standard type is `short` (range -32,768 to 32,767), which uses **2 bytes**.\n    *   **Input Handling**: To read the input statement, we can use `fgetc` or `getchar` to read characters one by one. Since we only need the second character, we don't need to store the entire string. We can read the first character, then read the second character into a temporary `char` variable for the comparison, and then discard the rest. This temporary variable requires **1 byte**.\n    *   Total minimum memory for variables = `sizeof(n)` + `sizeof(x)` + `sizeof(temp_char)` = 1 B + 2 B + 1 B = 4 B.\n    *   **Thus, y = 4.**\n\n**4. Final Answer Formulation**\n\n*   The Java program is incorrect, so the answer must begin with **'N'**.\n*   The format is `Nx+y`.\n*   Substituting our calculated values: `x = 100` and `y = 4`.\n*   The final answer is `N100+4`.\n\n<<<N100+4>>>"
