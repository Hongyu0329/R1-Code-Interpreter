    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the observer canonical form of the given discrete-time system using duality.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Duality Principle\n\nThe principle of duality in linear systems states that the controllability of a system (A, B) is equivalent to the observability of its dual system (A^T, B^T). Similarly, the observability of a system (A, C) is equivalent to the controllability of its dual system (A^T, C^T).\n\nTo find the observer canonical form for the system `(A, C)`, we can follow these steps:\n1.  Formulate the dual system, which is described by the pair `(A_d, B_d) = (A^T, C^T)`.\n2.  Find the controllable canonical form for this dual system. This involves finding a similarity transformation matrix `P` such that `A_c = P^{-1}A_d P` and `B_c = P^{-1}B_d` are in a controllable canonical form.\n3.  The observer canonical form of the original system, `(A_o, C_o)`, is then obtained by transposing the matrices of the controllable canonical form of the dual system:\n    *   `A_o = A_c^T`\n    *   `C_o = B_c^T`\n\n### Step 2: Formulate the Dual System\n\nThe original system matrices are:\nA = [[1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 1], [0, 2, 0]]\nC = [[0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0]]\n\nThe dual system matrices `(A_d, B_d) = (A^T, C^T)` are:\n`A_d = A^T = [[1, 2, 0], [1, 1, 2], [0, 1, 0]]`\n`B_d = C^T = [[0, 1], [1, 1], [0, 0]]`\n\nLet the two columns of `B_d` be `b_1 = [0, 1, 0]^T` and `b_2 = [1, 1, 0]^T`.\n\n### Step 3: Find the Controllable Canonical Form for the Dual System\n\nFirst, we check the controllability of the dual system by constructing the controllability matrix `W_c = [B_d, A_d B_d, A_d^2 B_d]`. The rank of `W_c` must be equal to the state dimension, `n=3`.\n\n`A_d b_1 = [[1,2,0],[1,1,2],[0,1,0]] * [0,1,0]^T = [2,1,1]^T`\n`A_d b_2 = [[1,2,0],[1,1,2],[0,1,0]] * [1,1,0]^T = [3,2,1]^T`\n\n`W_c = [b_1, b_2, A_d b_1, A_d b_2, ...] = [[0, 1, 2, 3, ...], [1, 1, 1, 2, ...], [0, 0, 1, 1, ...]]`\n\nTo check the rank, we can take the first three columns: `[b_1, b_2, A_d b_1]`.\n`det([[0, 1, 2], [1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1]]) = 0 - 1(1*1 - 0*1) + 2(1*0 - 0*1) = -1 ≠ 0`.\nSince the determinant is non-zero, these three vectors are linearly independent, and the rank of `W_c` is 3. The dual system is controllable, which means the original system is observable.\n\n**Controllability Indices and Transformation Matrix `P`:**\nWe select `n=3` linearly independent vectors from `W_c` by following the standard procedure: `b_1, b_2, A_d b_1, ...`.\n1.  Select `b_1`.\n2.  Select `b_2` (linearly independent from `b_1`).\n3.  Select `A_d b_1` (linearly independent from `{b_1, b_2}`).\n\nThe selected vectors are `{b_1, A_d b_1}` from the first input's chain and `{b_2}` from the second input's chain. This gives us the controllability indices `μ_1 = 2` and `μ_2 = 1`.\n\nA transformation matrix `P` can be constructed from these linearly independent vectors. A common choice for ordering is `P = [b_1, A_d b_1, b_2]`.\n`P = [[0, 2, 1], [1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 0]]`\n\nWe now find the inverse of `P`:\n`det(P) = 0 - 2(0 - 0) + 1(1 - 0) = 1`\n`P^{-1} = adj(P) / det(P) = [[-1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1], [1, 0, -2]]`\n\nNow, we compute the controllable canonical form matrices `B_c` and `A_c`.\n\n**Calculate `B_c`:**\n`B_c = P^{-1} B_d = [[-1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1], [1, 0, -2]] * [[0, 1], [1, 1], [0, 0]]`\n`B_c = [[-1*0+1*1+1*0, -1*1+1*1+1*0], [0*0+0*1+1*0, 0*1+0*1+1*0], [1*0+0*1-2*0, 1*1+0*1-2*0]]`\n`B_c = [[1, 0], [0, 0], [0, 1]]`\n\n**Calculate `A_c`:**\nFirst, `A_d P = [[1,2,0],[1,1,2],[0,1,0]] * [[0,2,1],[1,1,1],[0,1,0]] = [[2,4,3],[1,5,2],[1,1,1]]`\nThen, `A_c = P^{-1} (A_d P) = [[-1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1], [1, 0, -2]] * [[2,4,3],[1,5,2],[1,1,1]]`\n`A_c = [[-2+1+1, -4+5+1, -3+2+1], [0+0+1, 0+0+1, 0+0+1], [2+0-2, 4+0-2, 3+0-2]]`\n`A_c = [[0, 2, 0], [1, 1, 1], [0, 2, 1]]`\n\n### Step 4: Obtain Observer Canonical Form from Duality\n\nThe matrices for the observer canonical form, `(A_o, C_o)`, are the transposes of `(A_c, B_c)`.\n`A_o = A_c^T = [[0, 1, 0], [2, 1, 2], [0, 1, 1]]`\n`C_o = B_c^T = [[1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1]]`\n\nThe question asks for the value of the new matrix C, which is `C_o`.\n\nFinal verification: We can check that the characteristic polynomial of `A` and `A_o` are the same, ensuring `A_o` is a valid similarity transformation of `A`.\n`det(λI - A) = λ^3 - 2λ^2 - 3λ + 2`\n`det(λI - A_o) = λ^3 - 2λ^2 - 3λ + 2`\nThe polynomials match.\n\nThe final answer is the matrix `C_o`.\n\n`C_o = [[1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1]]`\n\n<<<[[1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1]]>>>"
