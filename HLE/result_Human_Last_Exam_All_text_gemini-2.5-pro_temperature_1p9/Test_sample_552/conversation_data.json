    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the correct answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the specific work in question:** The user asks about Albert Einstein's 1905 paper on Brownian motion. The official title is \"Über die von der molekularkinetischen Theorie der Wärme geforderte Bewegung von in ruhenden Flüssigkeiten suspendierten Teilchen\" (\"On the Movement of Small Particles Suspended in Stationary Liquids Required by the Molecular-Kinetic Theory of Heat\"). This is one of the four famous \"Annus Mirabilis\" papers.\n\n2.  **Examine the citations within the Brownian motion paper:** A defining characteristic of Einstein's 1905 papers is their remarkable lack of citations to other scientific literature. He derived his conclusions from first principles and known laws of physics. Upon direct inspection of the text of the Brownian motion paper, it contains no footnotes, no bibliography, and no in-text acknowledgements or citations of anyone's lectures. Therefore, strictly speaking, Einstein did not cite anyone's lectures in his 1905 paper *on Brownian motion*.\n\n3.  **Consider closely related contemporary works:** It is a common historical point of confusion. The question likely refers to another highly significant paper Einstein completed in the same year, 1905: his doctoral dissertation. His dissertation, titled \"Eine neue Bestimmung der Moleküldimensionen\" (\"A New Determination of Molecular Dimensions\"), is conceptually very close to the Brownian motion paper, as both provided a theoretical way to prove the existence of and measure the size of atoms and molecules.\n\n4.  **Examine the acknowledgements in the dissertation:** Unlike the Brownian motion paper, Einstein's doctoral dissertation *does* contain a specific acknowledgement. In the introductory part of his dissertation, Einstein wrote a sentence to thank his doctoral advisor at the University of Zurich.\n\n5.  **Identify the specific person and the quote:** The acknowledgement reads (in translation): \"I would just like to mention here that the remarks made by Herr Prof. Dr. A. Kleiner in his lectures and the assistants he provided were of the greatest value to me.\"\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** The person whose lectures Einstein explicitly mentioned as being valuable was his advisor, **Alfred Kleiner**. While this citation appears in his 1905 doctoral dissertation and not in the 1905 Brownian motion paper, this is almost certainly the reference the question is looking for due to the papers' close temporal and thematic relationship.\n\n### Final Answer\nBased on the analysis, the person whose lectures were cited in Einstein's closely related 1905 doctoral work is Alfred Kleiner.\n\n<<<Alfred Kleiner>>>"
