    "To solve this problem, we will analyze the second-order vacuum bubble diagrams in $\\phi^4$ scalar field theory, calculate the symmetry factor for each, and then sum these factors.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Context: $\\phi^4$ Theory and Vacuum Bubbles**\n\n*   The theory is the scalar field theory with a quartic interaction term. The interaction part of the Lagrangian is $\\mathcal{L}_{int} = -\\frac{\\lambda}{4!}\\phi^4$.\n*   \"Second-order\" means we are considering diagrams proportional to $\\lambda^2$. This requires two interaction vertices.\n*   \"Vacuum bubble\" diagrams are diagrams with no external lines. All internal lines form closed loops. These diagrams contribute to the vacuum energy. In general, physicists focus on *connected* diagrams due to the linked-cluster theorem, which states that the sum of all vacuum diagrams (connected and disconnected) is the exponential of the sum of connected vacuum diagrams. We will assume the question asks for the symmetry factors of the **connected** diagrams, which are the fundamental building blocks.\n\n**2. Identify the Diagrams**\n\nAt second order ($\\lambda^2$), we have two vertices. Each vertex originates from the $\\phi^4$ interaction, so it has 4 legs. To form a vacuum bubble, we must connect all 8 legs (4 from each of the two vertices) to each other, forming propagators. There are two topologically distinct ways to form a connected diagram:\n\n*   **Diagram 1: The \"Quadruple-Edge\" Diagram**\n    All four legs from the first vertex connect to the four legs of the second vertex. This results in a diagram with two vertices connected by four propagators.\n\n*   **Diagram 2: The \"Figure-Eight\" Diagram**\n    Two legs from the first vertex connect to two legs of the second vertex. The remaining two legs of the first vertex connect to each other, forming a self-loop. Likewise, the remaining two legs of the second vertex also form a self-loop. This diagram has two vertices, two propagators connecting them, and one self-loop on each vertex.\n\n**3. Define the Symmetry Factor (S)**\n\nThe symmetry factor $S$ of a Feynman diagram is a correction factor that accounts for the indistinguishability of vertices and propagators. It is the order of the automorphism group of the graph, which is the number of permutations of its elements (vertices and lines) that leave the graph's structure unchanged. The contribution of a diagram to a physical quantity is inversely proportional to its symmetry factor ($1/S$).\n\n**4. Calculate the Symmetry Factor for Diagram 1**\n\nLet's analyze the symmetries of the \"quadruple-edge\" diagram:\n*   **Vertex Symmetry:** The two vertices are of the same type and can be interchanged without altering the diagram. This gives a factor of **2**.\n*   **Propagator Symmetry:** The four propagators connect the same two vertices, making them indistinguishable. They can be permuted among themselves in any way. This gives a factor of $4! = 24$.\n\nThe total symmetry factor $S_1$ is the product of these factors:\n$S_1 = 2 \\times 4! = 2 \\times 24 = 48$.\n\n**5. Calculate the Symmetry Factor for Diagram 2**\n\nLet's analyze the symmetries of the \"figure-eight\" diagram:\n*   **Vertex Symmetry:** The two vertices are structurally identical (each has one self-loop and two lines connecting to the other vertex). Swapping the two vertices leaves the diagram invariant. This gives a factor of **2**.\n*   **Connecting Propagator Symmetry:** The two propagators connecting the two vertices are equivalent. They can be swapped. This gives a factor of $2! = 2$.\n*   **Self-Loop Symmetry:** Each self-loop (propagator starting and ending on the same vertex) has a symmetry. A propagator connects two field operators from the vertex term ($\\phi^4$). Swapping which field operator corresponds to which \"end\" of the propagator line does not change the contraction. This gives a factor of **2** for the loop on the first vertex.\n*   **Self-Loop Symmetry (2):** The same symmetry applies to the loop on the second vertex. This gives another factor of **2**.\n\nThe total symmetry factor $S_2$ is the product of all these individual symmetry factors:\n$S_2 = 2 \\times 2! \\times 2 \\times 2 = 16$.\n\n**A Careful Point: Confirmation via Combinatorics**\n\nThe symmetry factor $S_k$ for a diagram of order $n$ (here $n=2$) with a vertex of valence $p$ (here $p=4$) can also be calculated from the number of Wick contractions ($N_c$) that form the diagram: $S_k = \\frac{n! (p!)^n}{N_{ck}}$.\n*   For Diagram 1, the number of ways to connect 4 fields at vertex 1 to 4 fields at vertex 2 is $N_{c1} = 4! = 24$. Thus, $S_1 = \\frac{2! (4!)^2}{24} = \\frac{2 \\times 576}{24} = 48$. This confirms our result.\n*   For Diagram 2, the number of ways to choose 2 fields for a self-loop at vertex 1 is $\\binom{4}{2}=6$, similarly 6 ways at vertex 2. The remaining two fields at each vertex can be connected in 2 ways. Total contractions $N_{c2} = 6 \\times 6 \\times 2 = 72$. Thus, $S_2 = \\frac{2! (4!)^2}{72} = \\frac{2 \\times 576}{72} = 16$. This also confirms our result.\n\n**Another Careful Point: Disconnected Diagrams**\nThere exists a third second-order vacuum diagram, which is disconnected. It consists of two separate single-vertex diagrams, where each vertex has two self-loops. As discussed, the standard framework of QFT evaluates connected diagrams first. The symmetry factor for this disconnected diagram is 128, but it is not typically included in this type of summation for the reason explained by the linked-cluster theorem. Thus, we only sum the factors for the connected diagrams.\n\n**6. Sum the Symmetry Factors**\n\nThe final step is to sum the symmetry factors for the two connected diagrams we have analyzed.\nSum = $S_1 + S_2$\nSum = $48 + 16$\nSum = $64$\n\n<<<64>>>"
