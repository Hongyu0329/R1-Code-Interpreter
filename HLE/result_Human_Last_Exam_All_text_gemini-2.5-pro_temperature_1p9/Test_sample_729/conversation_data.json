    "Answering this question requires understanding the definition of a power subgroup and the structure of the generalized quaternion group $Q_{128}$.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the definition of a power subgroup.**\nA subgroup $H$ of a group $G$ is called a power subgroup if there exists an integer $m$ such that $H$ consists of all the $m$-th powers of the elements of $G$. In other words, $H = G^m = \\{g^m | g \\in G\\}$.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the generalized quaternion group of size 128.**\nThe generalized quaternion group of order $2^n$ (for $n \\ge 3$) is denoted $Q_{2^n}$. For size 128, we have $128 = 2^7$, so we are considering the group $Q_{2^7}$.\nThe presentation of this group, let's call it $G$, is:\n$G = Q_{128} = \\langle x, y \\mid x^{64} = 1, y^2 = x^{32}, y^{-1}xy = x^{-1} \\rangle$.\n\nLet's analyze the elements and their properties:\n*   The group $G$ has 128 elements.\n*   The subgroup $\\langle x \\rangle$ is a cyclic group of order 64. Its elements are $\\{1, x, x^2, \\ldots, x^{63}\\}$.\n*   The other 64 elements are of the form $x^i y$ for $0 \\le i \\le 63$. These form the coset $\\langle x \\rangle y$.\n*   The order of an element $x^i$ is $64/\\gcd(i, 64)$.\n*   The order of an element $g = x^i y$ is 4, because $g^2 = (x^i y)(x^i y) = x^i(yx^i)y = x^i(x^{-i}y)y = y^2 = x^{32}$, and $g^4 = (x^{32})^2 = x^{64} = 1$.\n*   The exponent of the group $G$ is the least common multiple of the orders of all its elements. The orders are divisors of 64 or are 4. Thus, the exponent is $\\text{lcm}(64, 4) = 64$.\n\n**Step 3: Compute the set of m-th powers, G^m.**\nWe need to calculate $G^m = \\{g^m \\mid g \\in G\\}$ for an integer $m$. We can split this into two parts: powers of elements in $\\langle x \\rangle$ and powers of elements in $\\langle x \\rangle y$.\n\nLet's compute the powers of an element $g = x^i y$:\n*   If $m$ is even, say $m=2k$, then $(x^i y)^m = ((x^i y)^2)^k = (x^{32})^k = x^{32k}$.\n*   If $m$ is odd, say $m=2k+1$, then $(x^i y)^m = (x^i y)^{2k}(x^i y) = x^{32k}(x^i y) = x^{32k+i}y$.\n\nNow we can determine $G^m$ based on the parity of $m$.\n\n**Case 1: m is odd.**\nLet $m = 2k+1$.\n*   The set of $m$-th powers of elements in $\\langle x \\rangle$ is $\\{(x^i)^m \\mid 0 \\le i \\le 63\\} = \\{x^{im} \\mid 0 \\le i \\le 63\\}$. Since $m$ is odd, $\\gcd(m, 64)=1$. This means the mapping $i \\mapsto im \\pmod{64}$ is a permutation of $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 63\\}$. Therefore, this set of powers is the entire subgroup $\\langle x \\rangle$.\n*   The set of $m$-th powers of elements in $\\langle x \\rangle y$ is $\\{(x^i y)^m \\mid 0 \\le i \\le 63\\} = \\{x^{32k+i}y \\mid 0 \\le i \\le 63\\}$. The mapping $i \\mapsto 32k+i \\pmod{64}$ is also a permutation of $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 63\\}$. Therefore, this set of powers is the entire coset $\\langle x \\rangle y$.\n*   Combining these, $G^m = \\langle x \\rangle \\cup \\langle x \\rangle y = G$.\n*   So, for any odd integer $m$, the power subgroup is the group $G=Q_{128}$ itself. This gives us **one** power subgroup.\n\n**Case 2: m is even.**\nLet $m=2k$.\n*   The set of $m$-th powers of elements in $\\langle x \\rangle$ is $\\{(x^i)^m\\} = \\{x^{im}\\} = \\{x^{i(2k)}\\} = \\langle x^{2k} \\rangle$.\n*   The set of $m$-th powers of elements in $\\langle x \\rangle y$ is $\\{(x^i y)^m\\} = \\{(x^i y)^{2k}\\} = \\{x^{32k}\\}$. This set contains only a single element.\n*   Combining these, $G^m = \\langle x^{2k} \\rangle \\cup \\{x^{32k}\\}$.\n*   Is the element $x^{32k}$ already in the subgroup $\\langle x^{2k} \\rangle$? An element $x^a$ is in $\\langle x^b \\rangle$ if $a$ is a multiple of $\\gcd(b, 64)$. We need to check if $x^{32k}$ is a power of $x^{2k}$. This is equivalent to checking if the congruence $32k \\equiv (2k)j \\pmod{64}$ has a solution for $j$. This simplifies to $16k \\equiv kj \\pmod{32}$. Let $d = \\gcd(k, 32)$. The congruence has a solution for $j$ if and only if $d$ divides $16k$. Since $d$ divides $k$, it must divide $16k$. So a solution always exists (for example $j=16$ works if $d=1$). Therefore, $x^{32k} \\in \\langle x^{2k} \\rangle$.\n*   So, for any even integer $m=2k$, the power subgroup is $G^m = \\langle x^{2k} \\rangle$.\n\n**Step 4: Count the distinct subgroups obtained in Case 2.**\nThe subgroups obtained are of the form $\\langle x^{2k} \\rangle$ for $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. The subgroup generated by $x^j$ is the same as the one generated by $x^{\\gcd(j, 64)}$. So we are looking for the set of distinct subgroups $\\{\\langle x^{\\gcd(2k, 64)} \\rangle \\mid k \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}$.\n\nLet $d = \\gcd(2k, 64)$.\nSince 64 is a power of 2, its divisors are $1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64$.\nThe term $2k$ is always even, so $d = \\gcd(2k, 64)$ must be an even number (unless $2k$ is a multiple of 64, in which case gcd is 64). So $d$ cannot be 1.\nThe possible values for $d$ are the even divisors of 64: $\\{2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64\\}$.\nWe can achieve each of these values for $d$:\n*   $d=2$: choose $2k=2$ (i.e., $k=1, m=2$). $G^2 = \\langle x^2 \\rangle$.\n*   $d=4$: choose $2k=4$ (i.e., $k=2, m=4$). $G^4 = \\langle x^4 \\rangle$.\n*   $d=8$: choose $2k=8$ (i.e., $k=4, m=8$). $G^8 = \\langle x^8 \\rangle$.\n*   $d=16$: choose $2k=16$ (i.e., $k=8, m=16$). $G^{16} = \\langle x^{16} \\rangle$.\n*   $d=32$: choose $2k=32$ (i.e., $k=16, m=32$). $G^{32} = \\langle x^{32} \\rangle$.\n*   $d=64$: choose $2k=64$ (i.e., $k=32, m=64$). $G^{64} = \\langle x^{64} \\rangle = \\{1\\}$.\n\nThese are 6 distinct cyclic subgroups of $G$.\n1.  $\\langle x^2 \\rangle$ (order 32)\n2.  $\\langle x^4 \\rangle$ (order 16)\n3.  $\\langle x^8 \\rangle$ (order 8)\n4.  $\\langle x^{16} \\rangle$ (order 4)\n5.  $\\langle x^{32} \\rangle$ (order 2, this is the center of $G$)\n6.  $\\{1\\}$ (the trivial subgroup)\n\n**Step 5: Final Count.**\nFrom Case 1 (m is odd), we have one power subgroup: $Q_{128}$.\nFrom Case 2 (m is even), we have six distinct power subgroups: $\\langle x^2 \\rangle, \\langle x^4 \\rangle, \\langle x^8 \\rangle, \\langle x^{16} \\rangle, \\langle x^{32} \\rangle, \\{1\\}$.\n\nThe total number of distinct power subgroups is $1 + 6 = 7$."
