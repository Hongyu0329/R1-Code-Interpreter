    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of a given conductor and order.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the core concepts\n\n1.  **Dirichlet Character:** A Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $N$ is a function from integers to complex numbers, satisfying certain properties. It's built upon the group of units modulo $N$, denoted $(\\mathbb{Z}/N\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$.\n2.  **Decomposition of Characters:** If the conductor $N$ has a prime factorization $N = p_1^{k_1} p_2^{k_2} \\cdots p_r^{k_r}$, any character $\\chi \\pmod{N}$ can be uniquely expressed as a product $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\cdots \\chi_r$, where each $\\chi_i$ is a character modulo $p_i^{k_i}$.\n3.  **Primitive Character:** A character $\\chi \\pmod{N}$ is primitive if its conductor is exactly $N$. This means it cannot be induced from a character modulo a proper divisor of $N$. For a decomposed character $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\cdots \\chi_r$, $\\chi$ is primitive if and only if each component character $\\chi_i$ is primitive modulo its own prime-power modulus $p_i^{k_i}$.\n4.  **Order of a Character:** The order of $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\cdots \\chi_r$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its components: $\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_1), \\dots, \\text{ord}(\\chi_r))$.\n\nOur goal is to find the number of primitive characters $\\chi \\pmod{36036}$ such that $\\text{ord}(\\chi) = 6$.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the given conductor N\n\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of $N$.\n$N = 36036 = 36 \\times 1001 = (2^2 \\times 3^2) \\times (7 \\times 11 \\times 13)$.\nSo, $N = 2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7^1 \\cdot 11^1 \\cdot 13^1$.\n\nA character $\\chi \\pmod{36036}$ is a product $\\chi = \\chi_4 \\chi_9 \\chi_7 \\chi_{11} \\chi_{13}$. For $\\chi$ to be primitive with conductor $N$, each component $\\chi_{p^k}$ must be a primitive character modulo its respective conductor $p^k$.\n\n### Step 3: Count valid primitive characters for each prime-power factor\n\nWe need to find the number of primitive characters $\\psi \\pmod{p^k}$ whose order divides 6. Let's analyze each factor of $N$.\n\n*   **Modulo 4 ($2^2$):**\n    The group of characters mod 4 is of order $\\phi(4)=2$. It has one principal character (order 1, conductor 1) and one non-principal character (order 2). The non-principal character is primitive, and its conductor is 4. Its order is 2, which divides 6.\n    *   Number of valid choices for $\\chi_4$: 1 (the one of order 2).\n\n*   **Modulo 9 ($3^2$):**\n    The group of characters mod 9 is cyclic of order $\\phi(9) = 3^1(3-1)=6$. A character mod 9 is primitive if it is not induced from a character mod 3. This is true if its order $d$ divides $\\phi(9)=6$ but does not divide $\\phi(3)=2$.\n    So, the order of a primitive character mod 9 must not divide 2. Possible orders are 3 and 6. Both of these divide 6.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = \\phi(2)\\phi(3) = 1 \\cdot 2 = 2$.\n    *   Total valid choices for $\\chi_9$: $2+2=4$. The order of $\\chi_9$ must be 3 or 6.\n\n*   **Modulo 7 ($7^1$):**\n    A character mod 7 is primitive if it is non-principal (i.e., its order is greater than 1). The character group is of order $\\phi(7)=6$. So, the order of any primitive character must divide 6. This condition is automatically satisfied.\n    *   Number of primitive characters mod 7: $\\phi(7)-1 = 6-1=5$. (There are $\\phi(d)$ characters for each $d|6, d>1$. $\\phi(2)+\\phi(3)+\\phi(6) = 1+2+2=5$).\n    *   Total valid choices for $\\chi_7$: 5. The order of $\\chi_7$ can be 2, 3, or 6.\n\n*   **Modulo 11 ($11^1$):**\n    A primitive character mod 11 must have an order $d>1$ that divides $\\phi(11)=10$. We also need its order to divide 6. The only common divisor of 10 and 6 greater than 1 is 2.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 2: $\\phi(2)=1$.\n    *   Total valid choices for $\\chi_{11}$: 1. The order of $\\chi_{11}$ must be 2.\n\n*   **Modulo 13 ($13^1$):**\n    A primitive character mod 13 must have an order $d>1$ that divides $\\phi(13)=12$. We need its order to divide 6. The common divisors of 12 and 6 greater than 1 are 2, 3, and 6.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 2: $\\phi(2)=1$.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 3: $\\phi(3)=2$.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 6: $\\phi(6)=2$.\n    *   Total valid choices for $\\chi_{13}$: $1+2+2=5$. The order of $\\chi_{13}$ can be 2, 3, or 6.\n\n### Step 4: Combine the choices and verify the final order\n\nWe have found the number of choices for each primitive component. Let's summarize the possible orders $(d_4, d_9, d_7, d_{11}, d_{13})$:\n*   $d_4 = 2$\n*   $d_9 \\in \\{3, 6\\}$\n*   $d_7 \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$\n*   $d_{11} = 2$\n*   $d_{13} \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$\n\nThe order of the final character $\\chi$ is $\\text{lcm}(d_4, d_9, d_7, d_{11}, d_{13})$. Let's check if this lcm is always 6.\n1.  All possible orders $d_i$ are divisors of 6. Therefore, their lcm must also divide 6.\n2.  The set of orders always includes $d_4=2$, so the lcm is always divisible by 2.\n3.  The set of orders always includes $d_9 \\in \\{3, 6\\}$, so the lcm is always divisible by 3.\n\nAn integer that is divisible by 2 and 3, and also divides 6, must be exactly 6.\nThus, any combination of our valid choices for the component characters will result in a primitive character of conductor $N$ and order exactly 6.\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the total number\n\nThe total number of such characters is the product of the number of choices for each component:\nTotal Number = (choices for $\\chi_4$) $\\times$ (choices for $\\chi_9$) $\\times$ (choices for $\\chi_7$) $\\times$ (choices for $\\chi_{11}$) $\\times$ (choices for $\\chi_{13}$)\nTotal Number = $1 \\times 4 \\times 5 \\times 1 \\times 5 = 100$."
