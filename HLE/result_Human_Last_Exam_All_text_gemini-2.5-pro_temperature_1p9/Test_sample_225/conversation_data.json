    "Answering the question step-by-step:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the curve.**\nThe curve is defined by the parametric equations:\nx(t) = cos(9t)\ny(t) = sin(5t)\nThis is a type of curve known as a Lissajous curve. These curves describe the complex harmonic motion where the x and y components have different frequencies.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the concept of self-intersection.**\nA self-intersection point is a point (x, y) on the curve that is reached at two or more different parameter values (times) t. That is, we are looking for the number of distinct points P for which P = (x(t1), y(t1)) = (x(t2), y(t2)) for some t1 ≠ t2 within the primary period of the curve.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the period of the curve.**\nThe period of the x-component, T_x, is 2π/9.\nThe period of the y-component, T_y, is 2π/5.\nThe curve will trace its complete path and then start repeating over the least common multiple (LCM) of the individual periods.\nT = LCM(2π/9, 2π/5) = 2π * LCM(1/9, 1/5) = 2π * (1/GCD(9, 5)) = 2π / 1 = 2π.\nSo, we need to find the number of self-intersection points for t in the interval [0, 2π).\n\n**Step 4: Use the standard formula for Lissajous curves.**\nFor Lissajous curves of the form x(t) = cos(at) and y(t) = sin(bt), where 'a' and 'b' are coprime integers, there is a well-established formula to calculate the number of self-intersection points.\n\nThe conditions for the formula are:\n- The curve is x(t) = cos(at), y(t) = sin(bt).\n- 'a' and 'b' are coprime integers.\n\nIn our case, a = 9 and b = 5.\n- Let's check if they are coprime: The greatest common divisor of 9 and 5 is GCD(9, 5) = 1. So they are coprime.\nThe conditions are met.\n\n**Step 5: Apply the formula.**\nThe formula for the number of self-intersection points (N) for a Lissajous curve x=cos(at), y=sin(bt) where a and b are both odd coprime integers is:\nN = (a - 1)(b - 1) / 2\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the result.**\nSubstitute the values a = 9 and b = 5 into the formula:\nN = (9 - 1)(5 - 1) / 2\nN = (8)(4) / 2\nN = 32 / 2\nN = 16\n\n**Careful points considered:**\n1.  The curve is correctly identified as a Lissajous curve.\n2.  The full period of the curve is correctly determined to be 2π.\n3.  The values of a=9 and b=5 are correctly identified.\n4.  The condition that 'a' and 'b' must be coprime is verified (GCD(9,5)=1).\n5.  The correct formula for this specific type of Lissajous curve (where both a and b are odd integers) is used. Direct calculation from first principles (solving trigonometric equations for t1, t2) is complex and prone to errors in counting distinct points, so using the established formula is the most reliable method.\n\nThe number of self-intersection points for the given curve is 16.\n\n<<<16>>>"
