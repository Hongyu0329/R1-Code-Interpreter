    "### Step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The question asks for the name of a specific mushroom *genus*. The key characteristic provided is that it is the *only* genus known to produce a \"distinctly blue spore print.\"\n\n2.  **Understanding Spore Prints:** A spore print is a critical tool for mushroom identification. It is made by allowing the microscopic spores of a mushroom cap to fall onto a surface, creating a macroscopic print. The color of this print is a key diagnostic feature. Common colors include white, cream, pink, yellow, various shades of brown, and black.\n\n3.  **Investigating the \"Blue Spore Print\" Claim:** The claim of a \"blue\" spore print is highly unusual. Most mycological guides and experts state that truly blue spore prints do not exist in the world of gilled mushrooms (Agaricales). Green spore prints are known and are very rare (famously produced by *Chlorophyllum molybdites*), which makes the idea of a blue print plausible, but it remains unconfirmed in a strict scientific sense.\n\n4.  **Identifying the Most Likely Candidate:** While a truly blue spore print is considered non-existent by experts, there is one genus strongly associated with the color blue. This is the genus *Lactarius*.\n    *   **The specific species:** *Lactarius indigo*, commonly known as the Indigo Milk Cap, is a striking mushroom that is blue throughout its structure (cap, gills, stem).\n    *   **The blue \"milk\":** When cut or damaged, it exudes a deep blue latex, or \"milk.\"\n    *   **The misconception:** Because the mushroom itself and its latex are so vividly blue, it is a very common misconception that its spore print must also be blue. People seeing the blue latex staining the paper during a spore print attempt may also mistake this for a blue spore color.\n\n5.  **Fact-Checking the Candidate:** Despite its overwhelmingly blue appearance, the actual spore print of *Lactarius indigo* is **creamy white to yellowish**. This is a crucial point of mycological accuracy.\n\n6.  **Considering Other \"Blue\" Mushrooms:** Other genera contain blue mushrooms, but their spore prints are not blue.\n    *   *Entoloma* (e.g., *E. hochstetteri*): Has a pink spore print.\n    *   *Stropharia* (e.g., *S. aeruginosa*): Has a purplish-brown spore print.\n    *   Blue-staining Boletes: The blue color is a bruising reaction; their spore prints are typically olive-brown.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** The question is based on a common, yet technically incorrect, piece of information. There is no known mushroom genus with a genuinely blue spore print. However, the question asks for the genus *known* to produce one, which points to the one that is famously associated with this trait, even if it's a misconception. The genus containing the Indigo Milk Cap, *Lactarius indigo*, is the undisputed source of this belief. Therefore, *Lactarius* is the intended answer to this trivia question.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n<<<Lactarius>>>"
