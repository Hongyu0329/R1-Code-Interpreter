    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of irreducible representations (irreps) of the symmetric group $S_{25}$ with a dimension strictly less than 500,000.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the correspondence between irreps and partitions.\nThe irreducible representations (irreps) of the symmetric group $S_n$ are in a one-to-one correspondence with the partitions of the integer $n$. A partition of $n$ is a way of writing $n$ as a sum of positive integers. For $S_{25}$, we need to consider the partitions of 25.\n\n### Step 2: Use the Hook-Length Formula for dimension.\nThe dimension of the irrep corresponding to a partition $\\lambda$ of $n$ is given by the hook-length formula:\n$$ \\dim(V_\\lambda) = \\frac{n!}{\\prod_{(i,j) \\in \\lambda} h_{i,j}} $$\nwhere the product is over all boxes $(i,j)$ in the Young diagram of $\\lambda$, and $h_{i,j}$ is the hook length of the box. The hook length of a box is the number of boxes to its right plus the number of boxes below it, plus one for the box itself.\n\nA key property is that a partition $\\lambda$ and its conjugate partition $\\lambda'$ (obtained by flipping the Young diagram along its main diagonal) correspond to irreps of the same dimension. So, non-self-conjugate partitions contribute to the count in pairs.\n\n### Step 3: Systematically search for partitions with small dimensions.\nThe dimensions of irreps are smallest for partitions whose Young diagrams are \"long and thin\" (e.g., those with only one or two rows, or a long first column). As the shape of the diagram becomes more \"square-like,\" the dimension grows very rapidly. We will search for partitions with dimensions less than 500,000 by starting with these \"thin\" partitions.\n\n#### A. Trivial and Sign Representations\n1.  **$\\lambda = (25)$**: This is a single row of 25 boxes. The dimension is $\\frac{25!}{25!} = 1$.\n2.  **$\\lambda = (1^{25})$**: This is a single column of 25 boxes (the conjugate of (25)). The dimension is also $\\frac{25!}{25!} = 1$.\n**(Count: 2)**\n\n#### B. Two-Row Partitions: $\\lambda = (25-k, k)$ for $k \\ge 1$\nWe calculate the dimensions for these partitions and their conjugates. The conjugate of $(n-k, k)$ is $(2^k, 1^{n-2k})$.\n*   **k=1: $\\lambda=(24, 1)$**. Dimension is $25-1=24$. Conjugate $\\lambda'=(2, 1^{23})$ also has dim=24.\n*   **k=2: $\\lambda=(23, 2)$**. Dim = 275. Conjugate $\\lambda'=(2^2, 1^{21})$ has dim=275.\n*   **k=3: $\\lambda=(22, 3)$**. Dim = 2,000. Conjugate $\\lambda'=(2^3, 1^{19})$ has dim=2,000.\n*   **k=4: $\\lambda=(21, 4)$**. Dim = 10,350. Conjugate $\\lambda'=(2^4, 1^{17})$ has dim=10,350.\n*   **k=5: $\\lambda=(20, 5)$**. Dim = 40,480. Conjugate $\\lambda'=(2^5, 1^{15})$ has dim=40,480.\n*   **k=6: $\\lambda=(19, 6)$**. Dim = 123,970. Conjugate $\\lambda'=(2^6, 1^{13})$ has dim=123,970.\n*   **k=7: $\\lambda=(18, 7)$**. Dim = 303,600. Conjugate $\\lambda'=(2^7, 1^{11})$ has dim=303,600.\n*   **k=8: $\\lambda=(17, 8)$**. Dim = 600,875, which is > 500,000. So we stop here.\nThis gives us 7 pairs of partitions.\n**(Count: 2 + 2*7 = 16)**\n\n#### C. Hook-Shaped Partitions: $\\lambda = (25-k, 1^k)$ for $k \\ge 1$\nThese partitions have a \"hook\" shape. The dimension is given by $\\binom{n-1}{k} = \\binom{24}{k}$. Note that for k=1, this is the partition (24,1) which we have already counted. We list the new partitions (k>1). The conjugate of $(n-k, 1^k)$ is $(k+1, 1^{n-k-1})$.\n*   **k=2: $\\lambda=(23, 1^2)$**. Dim = $\\binom{24}{2} = 276$. Conjugate $\\lambda'=(3, 1^{22})$ has dim=276.\n*   **k=3: $\\lambda=(22, 1^3)$**. Dim = $\\binom{24}{3} = 2,024$. Conjugate $\\lambda'=(4, 1^{21})$ has dim=2,024.\n*   **k=4: $\\lambda=(21, 1^4)$**. Dim = $\\binom{24}{4} = 10,626$. Conjugate $\\lambda'=(5, 1^{20})$ has dim=10,626.\n*   **k=5: $\\lambda=(20, 1^5)$**. Dim = $\\binom{24}{5} = 42,504$. Conjugate $\\lambda'=(6, 1^{19})$ has dim=42,504.\n*   **k=6: $\\lambda=(19, 1^6)$**. Dim = $\\binom{24}{6} = 134,596$. Conjugate $\\lambda'=(7, 1^{18})$ has dim=134,596.\n*   **k=7: $\\lambda=(18, 1^7)$**. Dim = $\\binom{24}{7} = 346,104$. Conjugate $\\lambda'=(8, 1^{17})$ has dim=346,104.\n*   **k=8: $\\lambda=(17, 1^8)$**. Dim = $\\binom{24}{8} = 735,471$, which is > 500,000. We stop here.\nThis gives us 6 new pairs of partitions.\n**(Count: 16 + 2*6 = 28)**\n\n#### D. Partitions with Three or More Parts\nWe now need to check \"thicker\" partitions, which are more computationally intensive. We continue to be systematic, starting with partitions that have a long first row.\n*   **$\\lambda=(22, 2, 1)$**. Dim = 4,025. Conjugate $\\lambda'=(3, 2, 1^{20})$ also has dim=4,025.\n*   **$\\lambda=(21, 3, 1)$**. Dim = 31,350. Conjugate $\\lambda'=(3, 2^2, 1^{18})$ also has dim=31,350.\n*   **$\\lambda=(21, 2, 2)$**. Dim = 21,000. Conjugate $\\lambda'=(3^2, 1^{19})$ also has dim=21,000.\n*   **$\\lambda=(21, 2, 1^2)$**. Dim = 31,625. Conjugate $\\lambda'=(4, 2, 1^{19})$ also has dim=31,625.\n*   **$\\lambda=(20, 4, 1)$**. Dim = 164,220. Conjugate $\\lambda'=(3, 2^3, 1^{16})$ also has dim=164,220.\n*   **$\\lambda=(20, 3, 2)$**. Dim = 207,000. Conjugate $\\lambda'=(3^2, 2, 1^{17})$ also has dim=207,000.\n*   **$\\lambda=(20, 3, 1^2)$**. Dim = 249,480. Conjugate $\\lambda'=(4, 2^2, 1^{17})$ also has dim=249,480.\n*   **$\\lambda=(20, 2, 2, 1)$**. Dim = 209,000. Conjugate $\\lambda'=(4, 3, 1^{18})$ also has dim=209,000.\nFurther checks on partitions like (19,5,1), (19,4,2), (18,6,1), and others show their dimensions exceed 500,000. This suggests we have found all such partitions.\nThis gives us 8 new pairs of partitions.\n**(Count: 28 + 2*8 = 44)**\n\n### Final Count\nLet's tally the number of partitions found:\n*   2 partitions from section A: (25) and (1^25).\n*   14 partitions from section B: 7 partitions and their 7 distinct conjugates.\n*   12 partitions from section C: 6 partitions and their 6 distinct conjugates.\n*   16 partitions from section D: 8 partitions and their 8 distinct conjugates.\n\nTotal number of irreducible representations = 2 + 14 + 12 + 16 = 44."
