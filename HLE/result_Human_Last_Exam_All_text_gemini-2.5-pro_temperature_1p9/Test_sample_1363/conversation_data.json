    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core concepts of the question.**\n*   **Reverse Turn:** A standard figure in ballroom dancing that turns to the left.\n*   **Overturn:** To turn more than the standard or prescribed amount for a given figure. For example, turning 1/2 when the textbook says 3/8.\n*   **Without disregarding the technique:** This is the most crucial part. It means you must adhere strictly to the fundamental principles that define the character of that specific dance. These principles include posture, hold, footwork, timing, rise and fall, sway, and Contrabody Movement (CBM). The question asks in which dance overturning a reverse turn would force a dancer to violate these core principles.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the technique of the Reverse Turn in each dance.**\n\n*   **A. Viennese Waltz:** The technique is characterized by continuous rotation and momentum. While there's a standard amount of turn per bar to progress around the room, dancers can and sometimes do slightly over- or under-turn to navigate the floor. Doing so doesn't fundamentally violate the core technique of rotation and sway, although it might look less polished. It is not \"impossible.\"\n\n*   **B. English Waltz & D. Slow Foxtrot:** These are both \"swing\" dances. Their technique is fundamentally based on creating momentum and swing through the body, utilizing principles like Rise and Fall, Sway, and CBM. This swing action is what allows for powerful and graceful movement. Because the turn is generated by swing, a dancer can intentionally create *more* swing to achieve *more* turn. While overturning might be technically difficult and can disrupt balance if done poorly, it is not a violation of the dance's core technique. In fact, advanced choreography often involves intentionally overturning figures for effect or floorcraft. You are still using swing, CBM, and rise & fall to achieve the overturn.\n\n*   **E. Quickstep:** Like the Waltz and Foxtrot, Quickstep is a swing dance, albeit a much faster one. The principles of creating movement and turn through body swing, CBM, and momentum still apply. Overturning a Reverse Turn or any other figure is possible by applying more energy and speed to the swinging action. It does not violate the core principles; it simply exaggerates them.\n\n*   **C. European Tango:** The technique of the Tango is unique and starkly contrasts with the swing dances.\n    *   **No Rise and Fall:** The dance is kept on a level plane with flexed knees.\n    *   **No Swing:** Turns are not created by a swinging momentum of the body. Instead, they are rotational and often described as a swivel or twist. The body stays very compact.\n    *   **Staccato Action:** Movements are sharp, deliberate, and have a clipped feeling.\n    *   **How the Turn Works:** In a Tango Reverse Turn, the turn is executed with a sharp rotation of the upper body, with the feet being placed precisely underneath. There is no swing to generate momentum. To achieve *more* turn (overturn), a dancer would be forced to introduce body swing and momentum, similar to how it's done in a Waltz or Foxtrot. The moment they do this, they have violated the fundamental \"no swing\" and \"no rise and fall\" rules of Tango. The action would cease to be a Tango action. Therefore, it is impossible to overturn a Tango Reverse Turn while still adhering to the correct Tango technique.\n\n**Step 3: Synthesize the findings and conclude.**\n\nThe swing dances (Waltz, Foxtrot, Quickstep) use momentum and body swing as a core part of their technique, which can be manipulated to create more or less turn. The Tango's technique explicitly forbids this kind of swing. The rotational, staccato nature of Tango turns places a physical limit on the amount of turn possible. Exceeding that limit requires abandoning Tango technique and introducing swing, which is a fundamental violation.\n\n<<<C>>>"
