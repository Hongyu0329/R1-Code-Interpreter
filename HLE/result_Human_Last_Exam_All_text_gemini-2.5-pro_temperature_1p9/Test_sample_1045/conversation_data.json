    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of contracted Gaussian functions for a 6-31G calculation of toluene.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Molecular Formula\n*   The molecule is toluene.\n*   The chemical formula for toluene is **C7H8**.\n*   This means the molecule consists of 7 Carbon (C) atoms and 8 Hydrogen (H) atoms.\n\n### Step 2: Understand the Basis Set Notation (6-31G)\nThe 6-31G basis set is a Pople-style split-valence basis set. We need to break down the notation to understand how many functions are used for each atom. The hyphen separates the description of core orbitals from valence orbitals.\n\n*   **\"6-\"**: This part describes the core orbitals. Each core atomic orbital is represented by **one contracted Gaussian function**, which is formed from a linear combination of 6 primitive Gaussian functions (PGFs).\n*   **\"-31G\"**: This part describes the valence orbitals. The valence shell is \"split\" into two parts, meaning each valence atomic orbital is represented by **two contracted Gaussian functions**:\n    *   An \"inner\" part, represented by one contracted function made from 3 PGFs.\n    *   An \"outer\" part, represented by a second contracted function made from 1 PGF (the G simply stands for Gaussian).\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Number of Functions per Carbon (C) Atom\nA carbon atom (atomic number 6) has the electron configuration 1s²2s²2p².\n*   **Core Orbital:** The 1s orbital is the core orbital. According to the \"6-\" notation, it is described by **1 contracted function**.\n*   **Valence Orbitals:** The 2s and three 2p (2px, 2py, 2pz) orbitals are the valence orbitals. There are 1 (s-type) + 3 (p-type) = 4 valence orbitals in total.\n*   According to the \"-31G\" notation, each of these 4 valence orbitals is described by **2 contracted functions**.\n*   Total functions for the 4 valence orbitals = 4 orbitals × 2 functions/orbital = **8 contracted functions**.\n*   **Total functions per Carbon atom** = (Functions for core) + (Functions for valence) = 1 + 8 = **9 contracted functions**.\n\n### Step 4: Determine the Number of Functions per Hydrogen (H) Atom\nA hydrogen atom (atomic number 1) has the electron configuration 1s¹.\n*   **Core Orbitals:** Hydrogen has no core electrons. The 1s orbital is its only orbital and it is a valence orbital.\n*   **Valence Orbital:** The 1s orbital is the single valence orbital.\n*   According to the \"-31G\" notation, this valence orbital is described by **2 contracted functions**.\n*   **Total functions per Hydrogen atom** = **2 contracted functions**.\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the Total Number of Functions for Toluene (C7H8)\nNow, we sum the functions for all the atoms in the molecule.\n*   Total functions from 7 Carbon atoms = 7 C atoms × 9 functions/C atom = **63 functions**.\n*   Total functions from 8 Hydrogen atoms = 8 H atoms × 2 functions/H atom = **16 functions**.\n*   **Total contracted Gaussian functions for C7H8** = 63 + 16 = **79 functions**.\n\n### Careful Points to Note:\n1.  **Molecule Composition:** Be sure to have the correct number of atoms (7 C, 8 H).\n2.  **Core vs. Valence:** Correctly identify which orbitals are core and which are valence for each element (C has a 1s core; H has none).\n3.  **Basis Set Interpretation:** The hyphen is the key separator. The numbers \"3\" and \"1\" in \"31G\" correspond to the number of primitives in each of the two contracted valence functions, but the count we need is the number of contracted functions themselves (which is 2 for each valence orbital).\n4.  **Contracted vs. Primitive:** The question asks for the number of *contracted* functions, not the more numerous *primitive* functions. Our calculation correctly tallies the contracted functions.\n\nFinal calculation: (7 atoms of C * 9 functions/C) + (8 atoms of H * 2 functions/H) = 63 + 16 = 79.\n\n<<<79>>>"
