    "Answering this question requires a careful analysis of archaeological evidence from pre-Columbian Mesoamerica, the region where the most sophisticated writing and calendrical systems were developed.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the earliest known recorded date:\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Core of the Question**\nThe question asks for the \"earliest known date recorded\" in an \"aboriginal writing system.\" This means we are not looking for the oldest civilization or the oldest piece of writing in general, but specifically the oldest inscription that marks a precise point in time using a native calendar that can be correlated with our own. The key is a decipherable, specific date.\n\n**Step 2: Identifying Potential Cultures and Calendar Systems**\nThe most advanced calendrical system in the pre-Columbian Americas was the Long Count, a system that counts days continuously from a fixed mythological starting point. This system allows for the recording of absolute, non-repeating dates within a cycle of approximately 5,125 years. The system was used by several Mesoamerican cultures, including the Epi-Olmec and the Maya.\n\n**Step 3: Examining the Main Candidates for the Earliest Recorded Date**\n\n*   **Zapotec Civilization (Monte Albán):** Stelae from Monte Albán contain very early calendrical glyphs, possibly dating as far back as 600 BCE. However, these dates are recorded using a 260-day calendar, which is cyclical. While the carvings are ancient, the dates they record are not absolute and cannot be definitively fixed to a single day in history without a Long Count component.\n*   **Maya Civilization (e.g., Tikal):** The Maya are famous for their use of the Long Count. However, their earliest known Long Count dates are from a later period. For instance, Stela 29 at Tikal carries a Long Count date corresponding to **July 6, 292 CE**. While early, this is not the earliest known.\n*   **A recent discovery at San Bartolo, Guatemala:** In 2022, scholars announced the discovery of a painted plaster fragment featuring the day-name glyph for \"7 Deer\". The fragment was radiocarbon-dated to between 300 and 200 BCE, making it the earliest known *physical example* of calendrical writing found to date.\n    *   **Careful Point:** Similar to the Zapotec example, \"7 Deer\" is a date from the 260-day ritual calendar. This date repeats every 260 days. While the act of writing the date is very old (c. 250 BCE), the date itself is not absolute. We cannot know which specific \"7 Deer\" day in history it refers to based on the inscription alone.\n\n*   **Epi-Olmec Civilization (Tres Zapotes):** This culture, which flourished in the Veracruz region of Mexico between the Olmec and the Classic Maya periods, provides the strongest candidate. The key artifact is **Stela C from Tres Zapotes**.\n    *   **The Artifact and its Date:** Stela C is a carved stone monument that contains a date in the Long Count system. The legible portion of the date is 16.6.16.18. The first and most significant number, the Baktun (a 144,000-day cycle), was broken off. However, based on the artistic style and archaeological context, epigraphers have confidently reconstructed the missing number as 7.\n    *   **The Full Date:** The complete Long Count date is therefore **7.16.6.16.18**.\n    *   **Correlation to our Calendar:** The Long Count calendar begins on a date equivalent to August 11, 3114 BCE. By calculating the total number of days from this starting point, the date 7.16.6.16.18 on Stela C corresponds to **September 3, 32 BCE** in the Proleptic Gregorian calendar.\n\n**Step 4: Conclusion**\n\nWhile the San Bartolo fragment represents the oldest *act* of writing a calendrical day (c. 250 BCE), the inscription on Tres Zapotes Stela C is the earliest known *absolute date* recorded. It pinpoints a specific, unique day in history using the Long Count system. Therefore, the date recorded on Stela C is recognized as the earliest definitive date from a pre-Columbian writing system.\n\nThe final answer is the date itself.\n\n<<<September 3, 32 BCE>>>"
