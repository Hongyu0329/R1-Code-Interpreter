    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to arrive at the solution.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Context\nThe question asks about the representations of the quantum group $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$ where $q$ is a primitive third root of unity. The key information is that $q$ is a root of unity.\n\nWhen $q$ is not a root of unity (the generic case), the representation theory of $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$ is very similar to that of the classical Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C}$. In particular, the category of finite-dimensional representations is **semisimple**. This means every representation can be decomposed into a direct sum of irreducible (simple) representations. In a semisimple category, the indecomposable objects are precisely the irreducible objects. If this were the case, 100% of indecomposable objects would be irreducible.\n\nHowever, when $q$ is a root of unity, the category is **not semisimple**. This means there exist indecomposable representations that are reducible (i.e., they have non-trivial submodules but cannot be written as a direct sum of them). The question is to determine the proportion of these two types of indecomposable objects.\n\n### Step 2: Defining the parameter $\\ell$\nLet $q = e^{2\\pi i / 3}$. The relevant integer for the representation theory at a root of unity is the smallest positive integer $\\ell$ such that the quantum integer $[\\ell]_q = 0$. The quantum integer $[n]_q$ is defined as $\\frac{q^n - q^{-n}}{q - q^{-1}}$.\nFor $q = e^{2\\pi i / 3}$:\n*   $[1]_q = 1$\n*   $[2]_q = q + q^{-1} = 2\\cos(2\\pi/3) = -1$\n*   $[3]_q = q^2 + q^0 + q^{-2} = \\frac{q^3 - q^{-3}}{q - q^{-1}} = \\frac{1-1}{q-q^{-1}} = 0$\nSo, for this problem, $\\ell = 3$.\n\n### Step 3: Classifying the Indecomposable Representations\nThe full classification of indecomposable representations for $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$ at a root of unity is complex and includes infinite families of representations, some of which are parametrized by continuous variables (complex numbers).\nThese families include:\n1.  **Simple (irreducible) modules:** These include a finite set of modules of dimension less than $\\ell$ and a continuous family of modules of dimension $\\ell$.\n2.  **Reducible indecomposable modules:** These include a finite set of projective modules and several continuous families of modules.\n\nThe phrase \"What percentage of the objects of C\" is ambiguous when dealing with a category that has infinitely many non-isomorphic objects, including continuously-parameterized families. A literal calculation would lead to an ill-defined result like $\\infty / \\infty$ or a trivial result like $0\\%$.\n\n### Step 4: A Natural Interpretation of the Question\nGiven the ambiguity, the question most likely refers to a specific, natural, and finite subset of indecomposable representations that are considered fundamental building blocks of the theory. In representation theory, the most fundamental indecomposable objects are the **simple modules** and their **indecomposable projective covers**.\n*   **Simple modules** (denoted $L_k$): These are the irreducible representations. By definition, they are indecomposable.\n*   **Indecomposable projective covers** (denoted $P_k$): For each simple module $L_k$, there is a unique indecomposable projective module $P_k$ that has $L_k$ as its quotient. In a non-semisimple category like this one, the projective modules are not simple, and therefore they are reducible.\n\nLet's assume the question is asking for the percentage of irreducible objects within this fundamental set of indecomposables: {simples, projectives}.\n\n### Step 5: Counting the Fundamental Objects for $\\ell=3$\n1.  **Simple Modules:** For $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$ with $\\ell=3$, there are $\\ell-1 = 3-1=2$ isomorphism classes of simple modules of dimension less than $\\ell$. Let's call them $L_1$ and $L_2$ (with dimensions 1 and 2, respectively).\n    *   These 2 objects are **irreducible**.\n\n2.  **Indecomposable Projective Covers:** Corresponding to each of the $\\ell-1=2$ simple modules, there is an indecomposable projective cover. Let's call them $P_1$ and $P_2$.\n    *   Since the category is not semisimple and the dimensions of $P_1$ and $P_2$ (which are $2\\ell = 6$) are larger than the dimensions of $L_1$ and $L_2$, these projective modules are not simple. Therefore, they are **reducible**.\n\n### Step 6: Calculating the Percentage\nBased on the interpretation in Step 4, we consider the set of fundamental indecomposable objects to be $\\{L_1, L_2, P_1, P_2\\}$.\n*   Total number of object types in this set = 4.\n*   Number of irreducible object types = 2 (namely $L_1, L_2$).\n*   Number of reducible object types = 2 (namely $P_1, P_2$).\n\nThe percentage of objects that are irreducible is:\n$$ \\frac{\\text{Number of irreducible types}}{\\text{Total number of types}} = \\frac{2}{4} = 0.5 $$\nConverting this to a percentage gives $50\\%$.\n\nThis interpretation provides a clean, non-trivial answer that relies on the fundamental structure of the representation category, avoiding the complexities of counting infinite families of objects.\n\n<<<50>>>"
