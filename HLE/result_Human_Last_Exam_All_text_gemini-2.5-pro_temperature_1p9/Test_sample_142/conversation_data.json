    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of Configuration State Functions (CSFs) for a full CI calculation of $\\mathrm{CH}_2 \\mathrm{SiHF}$ with the 6-31G** basis set.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the total number of electrons ($N$)\n\nFirst, we identify the atoms in the molecule and sum their atomic numbers (which equals the number of electrons for a neutral molecule).\nThe molecule is $\\mathrm{CH}_2 \\mathrm{SiHF}$.\nThe constituent atoms are:\n*   1 Carbon (C), Atomic Number = 6\n*   3 Hydrogen (H), Atomic Number = 1\n*   1 Silicon (Si), Atomic Number = 14\n*   1 Fluorine (F), Atomic Number = 9\n\nThe total number of electrons is:\n$N = (1 \\times 6) + (3 \\times 1) + (1 \\times 14) + (1 \\times 9) = 6 + 3 + 14 + 9 = 32$ electrons.\n\nFor a singlet state ($S=0$), which is typical for the ground state of such a molecule, the electrons are divided equally between alpha and beta spins:\n*   Number of alpha electrons ($N_\\alpha$) = $N/2 = 32 / 2 = 16$\n*   Number of beta electrons ($N_\\beta$) = $N/2 = 32 / 2 = 16$\n\n### Step 2: Determine the total number of basis functions (orbitals, $K$)\n\nNext, we need to count the number of basis functions for each atom in the 6-31G** basis set. The notation `**` is equivalent to `(d,p)`, meaning d-type polarization functions are added to heavy atoms (non-hydrogen) and p-type polarization functions are added to hydrogen atoms. We assume the standard 6 Cartesian d-functions ($d_{xx}, d_{yy}, d_{zz}, d_{xy}, d_{xz}, d_{yz}$).\n\n*   **Hydrogen (H):**\n    *   The 6-31G part means the valence 1s orbital is described by two basis functions (a split-valence representation).\n    *   The second `*` (or the 'p' in (d,p)) adds a set of three p-type polarization functions ($p_x, p_y, p_z$).\n    *   Total for H = 2 (from 6-31G) + 3 (from p-polarization) = 5 basis functions.\n    *   Since there are 3 H atoms, they contribute $3 \\times 5 = 15$ basis functions.\n\n*   **Carbon (C, a 2nd-row heavy atom):**\n    *   The 6-31G basis represents the core (1s) and split-valence (2s, 2p) shells. This results in 9 basis functions (1 core s, 2 valence s, 2x3 valence p).\n    *   The first `*` (or the 'd' in (d,p)) adds a set of six d-type polarization functions.\n    *   Total for C = 9 (from 6-31G) + 6 (from d-polarization) = 15 basis functions.\n\n*   **Fluorine (F, a 2nd-row heavy atom):**\n    *   The count is the same as for Carbon.\n    *   Total for F = 9 (from 6-31G) + 6 (from d-polarization) = 15 basis functions.\n\n*   **Silicon (Si, a 3rd-row heavy atom):**\n    *   The 6-31G basis represents the core (1s, 2s, 2p) and split-valence (3s, 3p) shells. This results in 13 basis functions (1 for 1s, 1 for 2s, 3 for 2p, 2 for 3s, 2x3 for 3p).\n    *   The first `*` (or the 'd' in (d,p)) adds a set of six d-type polarization functions.\n    *   Total for Si = 13 (from 6-31G) + 6 (from d-polarization) = 19 basis functions.\n\n*   **Total number of basis functions ($K$):**\n    *   $K = (\\text{functions for C}) + (\\text{functions for 3H}) + (\\text{functions for F}) + (\\text{functions for Si})$\n    *   $K = 15 + 15 + 15 + 19 = 64$ basis functions (orbitals).\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the number of singlet CSFs\n\nThe number of Configuration State Functions (CSFs) for a system with $N$ electrons in $K$ orbitals for a total spin $S$ is given by a well-known formula. For a singlet state ($S=0$), and an even number of electrons ($N=2n$), the formula is often written in two equivalent ways:\n\n**Formula 1:**\n$N_{CSF}(S=0) = \\frac{1}{K+1} \\binom{K+1}{n} \\binom{K+1}{n+1}$\n\n**Formula 2:**\n$N_{CSF}(S=0) = \\binom{K}{n}^2 - \\binom{K}{n-1}\\binom{K}{n+1}$\n\nWe will use Formula 2 as it is a direct calculation involving differences of integers and avoids potential division issues with large numbers.\n\nWe have:\n*   $K = 64$\n*   $N = 32$, so $n = N/2 = 16$.\n\nPlugging these values into Formula 2:\n$N_{CSF} = \\binom{64}{16}^2 - \\binom{64}{15}\\binom{64}{17}$\n\n### Step 4: Compute the binomial coefficients and the final answer\n\nNow, we calculate the required binomial coefficients:\n*   $\\binom{64}{15} = 12,193,421,890,424$\n*   $\\binom{64}{16} = 38,104,443,907,575$\n*   $\\binom{64}{17} = 107,775,438,834,900$\n\nSubstitute these values back into the CSF formula:\n*   First term: $\\binom{64}{16}^2 = (38,104,443,907,575)^2 = 1,451,949,964,580,227,180,608,5625$\n*   Second term: $\\binom{64}{15}\\binom{64}{17} = (12,193,421,890,424) \\times (107,775,438,834,900) = 1,314,640,476,442,651,479,600$\n\nFinally, calculate the difference:\n$N_{CSF} = 1,451,949,964,580,227,180,608,5625 - 1,314,640,476,442,651,479,600$\n$N_{CSF} = 1,450,635,324,103,784,529,128,9625$\n\nThe number of CSFs is approximately $1.45 \\times 10^{25}$.\n\n<<<14506353241037845291289625>>>"
