    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the determinant of the given matrix.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nThe question asks for the determinant of a specific 3x3 matrix A.\n\\[\nA = \\begin{bmatrix}\n2 & -1 & -1 \\\\\n-1 & 2 & -1 \\\\\n-1 & -1 & 2\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\nWhile the question provides context (\"adjacency matrix of the Markov quiver for \\( m_{1/2} = 13 \\)\"), the matrix `A` is explicitly given. Therefore, the task is a direct computation of the determinant of `A`. We do not need to delve into the theory of Markov quivers to solve this problem.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n1.  **Correctly identify the matrix**: The matrix is explicitly defined, so there is no ambiguity.\n2.  **Choose a valid method**: There are several standard methods to compute a determinant:\n    *   Cofactor expansion (or Sarrus' rule for 3x3 matrices).\n    *   Row reduction to triangular form.\n    *   Observing properties of the matrix, such as linear dependence of its rows or columns.\n3.  **Execute the calculation accurately**: Pay close attention to arithmetic, especially the signs.\n\nLet's use two different methods to ensure the result is correct.\n\n### Method 1: Checking for Linear Dependence\n\nA fundamental property of determinants is that if the rows or columns of a matrix are linearly dependent, the determinant is zero. Linear dependence means that one row (or column) can be written as a linear combination of the others, or equivalently, that a non-trivial linear combination of the rows (or columns) equals the zero vector.\n\n1.  Let the three columns of the matrix `A` be \\(C_1, C_2, C_3\\):\n    \\[\n    C_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ -1 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad C_2 = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad C_3 = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\\\ -1 \\\\ 2 \\end{pmatrix}\n    \\]\n\n2.  Let's add the three columns together:\n    \\[\n    C_1 + C_2 + C_3 = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 + (-1) + (-1) \\\\ -1 + 2 + (-1) \\\\ -1 + (-1) + 2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 - 1 - 1 \\\\ -1 + 2 - 1 \\\\ -1 - 1 + 2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n    \\]\n\n3.  Since the sum of the three columns is the zero vector (\\(1 \\cdot C_1 + 1 \\cdot C_2 + 1 \\cdot C_3 = 0\\)), the columns are linearly dependent.\n\n4.  **Conclusion**: Because the columns of matrix `A` are linearly dependent, its determinant must be 0. This method is the quickest and least prone to calculation errors.\n\n### Method 2: Cofactor Expansion\n\nTo verify the result, let's also compute the determinant using the standard cofactor expansion formula along the first row.\n\n1.  The formula for the determinant of a 3x3 matrix is:\n    \\[ \\det(A) = a \\begin{vmatrix} e & f \\\\ h & i \\end{vmatrix} - b \\begin{vmatrix} d & f \\\\ g & i \\end{vmatrix} + c \\begin{vmatrix} d & e \\\\ g & h \\end{vmatrix} \\]\n    For our matrix `A`:\n    \\[\n    A = \\begin{bmatrix}\n    2 & -1 & -1 \\\\\n    -1 & 2 & -1 \\\\\n    -1 & -1 & 2\n    \\end{bmatrix}\n    \\]\n    So, \\(a=2, b=-1, c=-1\\).\n\n2.  Calculate the determinant:\n    \\[\n    \\det(A) = 2 \\begin{vmatrix} 2 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 2 \\end{vmatrix} - (-1) \\begin{vmatrix} -1 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 2 \\end{vmatrix} + (-1) \\begin{vmatrix} -1 & 2 \\\\ -1 & -1 \\end{vmatrix}\n    \\]\n\n3.  Evaluate the 2x2 determinants:\n    *   \\( \\begin{vmatrix} 2 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 2 \\end{vmatrix} = (2)(2) - (-1)(-1) = 4 - 1 = 3 \\)\n    *   \\( \\begin{vmatrix} -1 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 2 \\end{vmatrix} = (-1)(2) - (-1)(-1) = -2 - 1 = -3 \\)\n    *   \\( \\begin{vmatrix} -1 & 2 \\\\ -1 & -1 \\end{vmatrix} = (-1)(-1) - (2)(-1) = 1 - (-2) = 1 + 2 = 3 \\)\n\n4.  Substitute these values back into the main formula:\n    \\[\n    \\det(A) = 2(3) + 1(-3) - 1(3)\n    \\]\n    \\[\n    \\det(A) = 6 - 3 - 3\n    \\]\n    \\[\n    \\det(A) = 0\n    \\]\n\nBoth methods yield the same result.\n\n### Final Answer Acquisition\n\nBoth analyses consistently show that the determinant of the matrix `A` is 0. The fact that the sum of the columns is the zero vector is the most direct way to see this. This corresponds to the fact that \\(\\lambda = 0\\) is an eigenvalue of the matrix `A`, which immediately implies that the determinant (the product of all eigenvalues) is 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
