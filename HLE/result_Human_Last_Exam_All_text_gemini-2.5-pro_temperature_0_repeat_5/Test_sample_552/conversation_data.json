    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the core of the question.**\nThe question asks to identify the person whose *lectures* were cited by Albert Einstein in his specific 1905 paper on Brownian motion. The key elements are \"Albert Einstein,\" \"1905 paper on Brownian motion,\" \"cited,\" and \"lectures.\"\n\n**Step 2: Locate the specific paper.**\nThe paper in question is one of Einstein's four \"Annus Mirabilis\" (miracle year) papers. Its title is \"Über die von der molekularkinetischen Theorie der Wärme geforderte Bewegung von in ruhenden Flüssigkeiten suspendierten Teilchen\" (\"On the Motion of Small Particles Suspended in a Stationary Liquid, as Required by the Molecular-Kinetic Theory of Heat\").\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the citations within that specific paper.**\nA careful examination of the 1905 Brownian motion paper reveals a notable feature: it contains no formal bibliography, footnotes, or citations to the work of other scientists. Einstein developed his argument from fundamental thermodynamic and statistical principles. This lack of citation is often pointed out as a testament to the paper's originality and Einstein's independent working style at the time.\n\n**Step 4: Consider closely related work from the same period.**\nWhile the Brownian motion paper itself lacks citations, it's crucial to look at Einstein's other major work from that year, his doctoral thesis, titled \"A New Determination of Molecular Dimensions.\" Einstein submitted this thesis to the University of Zurich in July 1905, just two months after submitting the Brownian motion paper. The two works are deeply connected thematically and theoretically, both dealing with the statistical behavior of molecules.\n\n**Step 5: Examine the citations in the doctoral thesis.**\nUnlike the Brownian motion paper, Einstein's 1905 doctoral thesis *does* include a formal bibliography. In this bibliography, he cites several key scientific works that influenced his thinking.\n\n**Step 6: Identify the specific citation of \"lectures.\"**\nAmong the works listed in the bibliography of his thesis is **\"Vorlesungen über Gastheorie\"** by **Ludwig Boltzmann**. The German word \"Vorlesungen\" translates directly to **\"Lectures.\"** This work, \"Lectures on Gas Theory,\" was a foundational text in statistical mechanics and was crucial to the theoretical framework Einstein used.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAlthough the citation does not appear in the famous Brownian motion paper itself, it is present in his doctoral thesis from the very same year on a closely related subject. It is a common and understandable historical simplification to associate this citation with his 1905 work on Brownian motion as a whole. Therefore, the person whose lectures he cited was Ludwig Boltzmann.\n\n***\n\n<<<Ludwig Boltzmann>>>"
