    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Understand Critical-Level Views\n\nCritical-level views are a family of theories in population ethics. They assess the value of a population by summing up a value for each individual life. The value of an individual's life is not simply their welfare (or utility), but their welfare minus a certain positive constant, `c`, known as the \"critical level\".\n\n*   **Value of a population** = Σ (uᵢ - c), where uᵢ is the utility of person *i* and *c* is the critical level.\n*   **Key Implication:** Adding a new person with utility `u` to the population is considered an improvement only if `u > c`. If the person's utility is positive but below the critical level (0 < u < c), adding them makes the population worse off, even though they have a life worth living from their own perspective.\n\n### Step 2: Understand the Conditions of Arrhenius's Sixth Impossibility Theorem\n\nArrhenius's theorem shows that a set of five seemingly plausible conditions for a population axiology are mutually inconsistent. Any coherent theory must therefore violate at least one of them. Let's analyze each condition:\n\n*   **A. Egalitarian Dominance:** If two populations, A and B, have the same number of people, and population A has a higher total (and average) utility and is more equally distributed than B, then A is better than B.\n*   **B. General Non-Extreme Priority:** For any two welfare levels `w1 > w2 > 0`, there is some number of people `n` such that a population of `n` people all at the lower welfare level `w2` is better than a population of one person at the higher welfare level `w1`. This captures the intuition that numbers matter and we should prioritize helping a large number of less well-off people over a single very well-off person.\n*   **C. Non-Elitism:** There is some number of people `n` and some welfare level `w > 0` such that a population of `n` people at level `w` is at least as good as a population of one person at a very high welfare level. This prevents the value of one \"super-life\" from always outweighing any number of moderately good lives.\n*   **D. Weak Non-Sadism:** An equally distributed population is better than another population with the same number of people but at a lower welfare level. This is a very basic condition stating that, all else equal, more welfare is better.\n*   **E. Weak Quality Addition (WQA):** For any population, there is at least one positive welfare level `w` such that adding a person with that welfare level results in a better population. This ensures that adding *some* good life is always considered an improvement.\n\n### Step 3: Test Critical-Level Views Against Each Condition\n\nNow, let's see which of these conditions the critical-level view violates.\n\n*   **A. Egalitarian Dominance:** **Satisfied.** If populations A and B have size `n`, and Total Utility(A) > Total Utility(B), then the value of A is `Total Utility(A) - n*c` and the value of B is `Total Utility(B) - n*c`. Since `Total Utility(A) > Total Utility(B)`, it follows that `Value(A) > Value(B)`.\n*   **C. Non-Elitism:** **Satisfied.** The condition requires that for some `n` and `w > 0`, a population of `n` people at `w` is better than one person at a high level `h`. In critical-level terms: `n * (w - c) > 1 * (h - c)`. We can satisfy this by choosing any welfare level `w` that is greater than the critical level `c`. This makes `(w - c)` a positive number. We can then simply choose a large enough `n` to make the inequality true, no matter how large `h` is.\n*   **D. Weak Non-Sadism:** **Satisfied.** If population A has `n` people at welfare `w_A` and population B has `n` people at welfare `w_B`, with `w_A > w_B`, then `Value(A) = n * (w_A - c)` and `Value(B) = n * (w_B - c)`. Since `w_A > w_B`, it follows that `Value(A) > Value(B)`.\n*   **E. Weak Quality Addition:** **Satisfied.** The condition requires that we can always find *some* life worth adding. For a critical-level view, we can always choose a welfare level `w` that is greater than the critical level `c`. Adding a person with this welfare level `w` adds `(w - c)` to the total value, which is a positive amount, thus making the new population better.\n*   **B. General Non-Extreme Priority:** **Violated.** This condition states that for *any* pair of welfare levels `w1 > w2 > 0`, there is a number `n` where `n` lives at `w2` are better than one life at `w1`. Let's test this with a critical-level view.\n    *   We need to find an `n` such that: `Value(n people at w2) > Value(1 person at w1)`.\n    *   This translates to: `n * (w2 - c) > 1 * (w1 - c)`.\n    *   The condition must hold for *any* pair `w1, w2`. Let's choose a pair specifically to challenge the condition. Let the critical level `c = 10`. Now, choose welfare levels such that `w1 > c > w2`. For example, let `w1 = 20` and `w2 = 5`.\n    *   The inequality becomes: `n * (5 - 10) > 1 * (20 - 10)`.\n    *   This simplifies to: `n * (-5) > 10`, or `-5n > 10`.\n    *   This inequality can **never** be satisfied for any positive number of people `n`. A negative number can never be greater than a positive number.\n    *   Since we have found a pair of welfare levels (`w1=20, w2=5`) for which the condition fails, the critical-level view violates General Non-Extreme Priority.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe analysis shows that critical-level views satisfy all the conditions of Arrhenius's sixth theorem except for one: General Non-Extreme Priority. The violation occurs because lives below the critical level contribute negatively to the population's value, so no number of such lives can ever outweigh the positive value of a single life above the critical level.\n\n<<<B>>>"
