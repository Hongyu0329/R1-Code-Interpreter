    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to arrive at the final answer.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the core subject:** The question is about a specific individual, Andre Vernault, a Belgian refugee in the UK during World War II.\n2.  **Identify the central conflict:** UK counterintelligence (MI5) suspected him of being a German spy.\n3.  **Identify the reason for suspicion:** The text explicitly states the suspicion arose because he \"concealed from interrogators his true profession.\"\n4.  **Identify the goal:** The question asks to identify what this \"true profession\" was.\n5.  **Research the case:** This historical event is documented in books about WWII espionage, particularly those covering the work of MI5 and the Double-Cross System. A key source is Ben Macintyre's book, \"Double Cross: The True Story of the D-Day Spies.\"\n6.  **Synthesize the findings:** According to historical accounts, Andre Vernault was indeed a Belgian refugee who was intensely interrogated by MI5. His evasiveness and refusal to state his occupation made his interrogators highly suspicious. They believed he was a trained agent trying to hide his background.\n7.  **Uncover the truth:** The reality was that Vernault was not a spy. He was simply embarrassed by his profession, believing it sounded so absurd that no one would believe him and he would be ridiculed. After prolonged interrogation, he finally confessed his true profession.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n*   **The nature of counterintelligence:** During wartime, security services are on high alert. Any unusual behavior, such as being secretive about one's past, is a major red flag. Vernault's behavior fit the profile of a potential enemy agent.\n*   **The individual's perspective:** Vernault's motive for concealment was personal (embarrassment and fear of ridicule), not political or military. He feared that revealing he was a circus performer would make him seem frivolous or untrustworthy in a time of grave national crisis.\n*   **The resolution:** Once his profession was revealed and his story was verified, the suspicion against him was dropped. The case serves as a classic example of the difficulties and potential misjudgments involved in vetting people during wartime.\n\n**Acquiring the Final Answer:**\n\nBased on the historical records of this case, Andre Vernault's true profession, which he hid from his British interrogators out of fear of being laughed at, was a **lion tamer**.\n\n<<<Lion tamer>>>"
