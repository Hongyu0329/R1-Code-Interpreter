    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of each ballet step to determine which one ends in the same leg position as it starts. The \"leg position\" in this context refers to the configuration of the feet, specifically which foot is in front in a crossed position like fifth position.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the starting and ending position of each option.**\n\n*   **A. Entrechat six:**\n    *   **Starting Position:** The step typically begins in fifth position (e.g., right foot in front).\n    *   **Execution:** \"Entrechat\" means \"interweaving\" or \"braiding.\" The number \"six\" refers to six movements of the legs in the air. The dancer jumps vertically, and the legs beat rapidly. For an even-numbered entrechat like *quatre* or *six*, the dancer beats the legs and returns to the original starting position.\n    *   **Ending Position:** The dancer lands in the same fifth position they started from (e.g., right foot remains in front).\n    *   **Conclusion:** The starting and ending positions are the same.\n\n*   **B. Échappé battu changé:**\n    *   **Starting Position:** Begins in fifth position (e.g., right foot in front).\n    *   **Execution:**\n        *   *Échappé* means \"to escape.\" The dancer jumps from fifth position to second position.\n        *   *Battu* means \"beaten.\" As the legs close back to fifth, they beat together.\n        *   *Changé* means \"changed.\" This is the key word. It explicitly indicates that the feet will change their position.\n    *   **Ending Position:** The dancer lands in fifth position with the opposite foot in front (e.g., left foot in front).\n    *   **Conclusion:** The starting and ending positions are different.\n\n*   **C. Assemblé:**\n    *   **Starting Position:** Typically begins in fifth position (e.g., right foot in front).\n    *   **Execution:** \"Assemblé\" means \"to assemble.\" The dancer brushes one leg out, pushes off the supporting leg, and brings (\"assembles\") both legs together in the air before landing. In the most common forms, like *assemblé dessus* (over) or *dessous* (under), the feet change position. For example, in an *assemblé dessus*, the back foot brushes to the side and lands in front.\n    *   **Ending Position:** The dancer lands in fifth position, but with the feet switched (e.g., left foot in front).\n    *   **Conclusion:** The starting and ending positions are different.\n\n*   **D. Glissade derrière:**\n    *   **Starting Position:** Begins in fifth position (e.g., right foot in front).\n    *   **Execution:** \"Glissade\" means \"to glide.\" \"Derrière\" means \"behind.\" The dancer glides the back foot (the left foot) out to the side, transfers weight, and then closes the other foot (the right foot) *behind* the new standing leg.\n    *   **Ending Position:** The foot that was originally in front (right foot) is now in the back. The dancer ends in fifth position with the left foot in front.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The starting and ending positions are different.\n\n*   **E. Gargouillade:**\n    *   **Starting Position:** Begins in fifth position (e.g., right foot in front).\n    *   **Execution:** This is a complex, decorative step, similar to a *pas de chat* but with circular movements (*ronds de jambe*) of both legs in the air. The standard execution of a gargouillade involves a change of feet. The leading leg performs its circle and lands, and the following leg performs its circle and closes in front.\n    *   **Ending Position:** The dancer lands in fifth position with the opposite foot in front (e.g., left foot in front).\n    *   **Conclusion:** The starting and ending positions are different.\n\n**Step 2: Final Comparison**\n\nAfter analyzing all the options, the only step where the dancer lands in the exact same fifth position from which they started is the **Entrechat six**. All the other steps listed involve a *changement*, or change of feet.\n\n<<<A>>>"
