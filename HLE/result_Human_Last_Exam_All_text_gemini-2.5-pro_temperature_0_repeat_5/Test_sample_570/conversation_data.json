    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the minimal area of a convex domain that intersects all lines with the equation `px + qy = 1`, where `p` and `q` are coprime integers.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the set of lines**\n\nThe set of lines is `L = {l_{p,q} | px + qy = 1, p, q ∈ Z, gcd(p, q) = 1}`.\nA key property of these lines can be understood using Bezout's identity. The equation `pm + qn = 1` has integer solutions for `m` and `n` if and only if `gcd(p, q) = 1`. This means that a line `px + qy = 1` belongs to the set `L` if and only if it passes through at least one integer lattice point `(m, n) ∈ Z^2`.\nSo, the problem is to find the minimal area of a convex domain `K` that intersects every line passing through at least one integer lattice point.\n\n**Step 2: Identify necessary conditions for the convex domain K**\n\nLet `K` be such a convex domain.\nConsider the following lines from the set `L`:\n*   `p=1, q=0`: `x = 1`. `K` must intersect this line.\n*   `p=-1, q=0`: `-x = 1` or `x = -1`. `K` must intersect this line.\n*   `p=0, q=1`: `y = 1`. `K` must intersect this line.\n*   `p=0, q=-1`: `-y = 1` or `y = -1`. `K` must intersect this line.\n\nLet `x_max = sup{x | (x,y) ∈ K}` and `x_min = inf{x | (x,y) ∈ K}`.\nFor a convex set `K`, intersecting the line `x=c` is equivalent to `x_min ≤ c ≤ x_max`.\n*   `K` intersects `x=1` implies `x_min ≤ 1 ≤ x_max`.\n*   `K` intersects `x=-1` implies `x_min ≤ -1 ≤ x_max`.\nCombining these, we must have `x_min ≤ -1` and `x_max ≥ 1`.\n\nSimilarly, for the y-coordinates:\n*   `K` intersects `y=1` implies `y_min ≤ 1 ≤ y_max`.\n*   `K` intersects `y=-1` implies `y_min ≤ -1 ≤ y_max`.\nCombining these, we must have `y_min ≤ -1` and `y_max ≥ 1`.\n\n**Step 3: A crucial argument about specific points**\n\nConsider the point `P = (1, 0)`. Let's analyze the subset of lines in `L` that pass through `P`. A line through `P` can be written as `a(x-1) + by = 0`. For this to be in the form `px+qy=1`, we need `ax+by=a`. This requires `p=ka, q=kb, 1=ka`. So `k=1/a`, which means `p=1` and `q=b/a` must be an integer.\nThus, the lines `x + qy = 1` for any integer `q` all pass through `P=(1,0)`. Since `gcd(1, q) = 1` for any integer `q`, this entire family of lines belongs to `L`.\n\nNow, assume the point `P=(1,0)` is not in the convex domain `K`. Since `K` is convex, there must exist a separating line `l_s` that passes through `P` such that `K` lies entirely in one of the closed half-planes defined by `l_s`. Let this half-plane be `H`.\nThe family of lines `x+qy=1` for `q \\in Z` \"pivots\" around `P`. This family includes lines with a variety of slopes `-1/q` (covering slopes between -1 and 1, plus vertical). For `K` to intersect every line in this family, it cannot lie on only one side of `P`. If `K` is contained in the half-plane `H`, it will fail to intersect the lines from the family that lie in the opposite half-plane (except for `l_s` itself). This leads to a contradiction. Therefore, the point `P=(1,0)` must be contained in `K`.\n\nBy symmetry of the set of lines `L` (if `(p,q)` is a valid pair, so are `(-p,q)`, `(p,-q)`, `(q,p)`), the same argument applies to the points:\n*   `(-1, 0)` (pivot for lines `-x+qy=1`)\n*   `(0, 1)` (pivot for lines `px+y=1`)\n*   `(0, -1)` (pivot for lines `px-y=1`)\n\nSo, any valid convex domain `K` must contain the four points `(1,0), (-1,0), (0,1), (0,-1)`.\n\n**Step 4: Find the lower bound for the area**\n\nSince `K` is a convex set and must contain the points `(1,0), (-1,0), (0,1), (0,-1)`, it must also contain their convex hull.\nThe convex hull of these four points is the square `SQ` with vertices at these points. The boundary of this square is given by the lines `x+y=1`, `x-y=1`, `-x+y=1`, and `-x-y=1`. The region can be described by the inequality `|x| + |y| ≤ 1`.\nThe area of this square `SQ` can be calculated as half the product of its diagonals. The diagonals run from `(-1,0)` to `(1,0)` (length 2) and from `(0,-1)` to `(0,1)` (length 2).\nArea(SQ) = (1/2) * 2 * 2 = 2.\nTherefore, the area of any valid convex domain `K` must be at least 2. `Area(K) ≥ 2`.\n\n**Step 5: Verify if the lower bound is achievable**\n\nWe need to check if the square `SQ = {(x,y) | |x|+|y| ≤ 1}` is a valid domain, i.e., if it intersects every line `px+qy=1` with `gcd(p,q)=1`.\nA convex set intersects a line if and only if the set is not entirely on one side of the line. This means the minimum value of the function `f(x,y) = px+qy` on the set must be less than or equal to 1, and the maximum value must be greater than or equal to 1.\n`min_{SQ}(px+qy) ≤ 1 ≤ max_{SQ}(px+qy)`\nSince `f(x,y)` is a linear function, its extrema on the convex polygon `SQ` will occur at the vertices: `(1,0), (-1,0), (0,1), (0,-1)`.\nThe values at the vertices are:\n*   `f(1,0) = p`\n*   `f(-1,0) = -p`\n*   `f(0,1) = q`\n*   `f(0,-1) = -q`\nSo, `max_{SQ}(px+qy) = max(p, -p, q, -q) = max(|p|, |q|)`.\nAnd `min_{SQ}(px+qy) = -max(|p|, |q|)`.\nThe condition for intersection becomes `-max(|p|, |q|) ≤ 1 ≤ max(|p|, |q|)`. This simplifies to `max(|p|, |q|) ≥ 1`.\nSince `p` and `q` are coprime integers, they cannot both be zero. Therefore, at least one of `|p|` or `|q|` must be at least 1. This means `max(|p|, |q|) ≥ 1` is always true for any pair of coprime integers `(p,q)`.\nThus, the square `SQ` intersects every line in the set `L`.\n\n**Step 6: Conclusion**\n\nWe have shown that any valid convex domain must have an area of at least 2. We have also shown that the square `SQ = {(x,y) | |x|+|y| ≤ 1}` is a valid domain and has an area of exactly 2.\nTherefore, the minimal area is 2."
