    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Question\nThe question asks for the smallest possible number of isometric embeddings from a finite ultrametric space $X$ into a Banach space $B$ of cardinality $K$.\n\nLet's define the key terms:\n*   **Finite Ultrametric Space $(X, d)$**: A finite set $X$ with a metric $d$ that satisfies the strong triangle inequality: $d(x, z) \\le \\max\\{d(x, y), d(y, z)\\}$ for all $x, y, z \\in X$.\n*   **Banach Space $B$**: A complete normed vector space. The norm is $\\| \\cdot \\|$, and the induced metric is $d_B(u, v) = \\|u - v\\|$.\n*   **Isometric Embedding**: A function $f: X \\to B$ such that for all $x_1, x_2 \\in X$, we have $\\|f(x_1) - f(x_2)\\| = d(x_1, x_2)$.\n*   **Smallest Possible Number**: This asks for the minimum value of the number of isometric embeddings, where we can choose any finite ultrametric space $X$ and any suitable Banach space $B$.\n\nLet $N(X, B)$ be the number of isometric embeddings from $X$ to $B$. The question asks for the value of $\\min_{X, B} N(X, B)$.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Possibilities for the Number of Embeddings\n\nThe number of embeddings could be zero, a finite positive integer, or infinite.\n\n**Possibility 1: The number of embeddings is 0.**\nAn isometric embedding from a space $X$ to a space $B$ does not always exist. It depends on the specific structures of $X$ and $B$. We can construct a case where no such embedding exists.\n\n*   **Choose the space X**: Let $X = \\{x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4\\}$ be a set of four points. Define the metric $d(x_i, x_j) = 1$ for $i \\neq j$ and $d(x_i, x_i) = 0$. This is a valid ultrametric space because for any distinct $i, j, k$, the inequality $d(x_i, x_k) \\le \\max\\{d(x_i, x_j), d(x_j, x_k)\\}$ becomes $1 \\le \\max\\{1, 1\\}$, which is true.\n*   **Choose the Banach space B**: Let $B = \\mathbb{R}$, the real numbers with the standard absolute value norm, $\\|v\\| = |v|$. This is a Banach space.\n*   **Look for embeddings**: An isometric embedding $f: X \\to \\mathbb{R}$ would require finding four points $y_1, y_2, y_3, y_4 \\in \\mathbb{R}$ such that $|y_i - y_j| = 1$ for all $i \\neq j$.\n*   **Show non-existence**: Let $y_1$ be any point. Without loss of generality, let $y_1 = 0$. Then for $j=2, 3, 4$, we must have $|y_j - y_1| = |y_j| = 1$. This means $y_2, y_3, y_4$ must all belong to the set $\\{-1, 1\\}$. By the Pigeonhole Principle, since we are choosing three points from a set of two, at least two of the points must be identical. Let's say $y_i = y_j$ for $i, j \\in \\{2,3,4\\}, i \\neq j$. Then $|y_i - y_j| = 0$. However, an isometric embedding requires $|y_i - y_j| = d(x_i, x_j) = 1$. This is a contradiction ($0 \\neq 1$).\n*   **Conclusion**: No isometric embedding exists for this choice of $X$ and $B$. Therefore, $N(X, B) = 0$.\n\nSince we have found a case where the number of embeddings is 0, and this is the lowest possible non-negative integer, the absolute minimum is 0.\n\n### Step 3: Re-evaluating the Intent of the Question\n\nOften, when a question asks for the \"smallest possible number\", it implicitly assumes the existence of the object in question to avoid a trivial answer like 0. For example, \"What is the smallest number of sides a polygon can have?\" implies we are considering actual polygons, so the answer is 3, not 0.\n\nLet's adopt this interpretation: **What is the smallest possible number of isometric embeddings, given that at least one exists?**\nThis means we are looking for $\\min \\{ N(X, B) \\mid N(X, B) > 0 \\}$.\n\n### Step 4: Analyzing the Case Where Embeddings Exist\n\nLet's assume for a given pair $(X, B)$, there exists at least one isometric embedding, say $f: X \\to B$.\n\n*   **Translations**: Let $v$ be any vector in the Banach space $B$. Define a new function $f_v: X \\to B$ by $f_v(x) = f(x) + v$. This is a translation of the image of $X$.\n*   **Translations are Isometries**: Let's check if $f_v$ is also an isometric embedding:\n    $\\|f_v(x_1) - f_v(x_2)\\| = \\|(f(x_1) + v) - (f(x_2) + v)\\| = \\|f(x_1) - f(x_2)\\| = d(x_1, x_2)$.\n    So, $f_v$ is indeed an isometric embedding for any $v \\in B$.\n*   **Number of Embeddings in a Non-Trivial Banach Space**: If $B$ is a non-trivial Banach space (i.e., $B \\neq \\{0\\}$), it contains infinitely many distinct vectors. For each distinct vector $v \\in B$, we get a distinct embedding $f_v$. Therefore, if an embedding exists into a non-trivial Banach space, there must be infinitely many embeddings.\n*   **Finding a Finite Number**: To find a finite, non-zero number of embeddings, we must escape the conclusion above. This is only possible if the number of available translations is finite. This forces us to consider the **trivial Banach space**, $B = \\{0\\}$.\n\n### Step 5: The Trivial Banach Space Case\n\nLet's analyze the case where $B = \\{0\\}$.\n*   **Is B a Banach Space?**: The set $\\{0\\}$ is a vector space over any field. With the only possible norm, $\\|0\\|=0$, it is complete. So it is a Banach space. Its cardinality is $K=1$.\n*   **Embedding into B = {0}**: Suppose an isometric embedding $f: X \\to \\{0\\}$ exists. The only possible function is the one that maps every point in $X$ to the zero vector: $f(x) = 0$ for all $x \\in X$.\n*   **Condition for Isometric Embedding**: For $f$ to be isometric, the condition $\\|f(x_1) - f(x_2)\\| = d(x_1, x_2)$ must hold for all $x_1, x_2 \\in X$.\n    The left side is $\\|0 - 0\\| = 0$. So, the condition simplifies to $d(x_1, x_2) = 0$ for all $x_1, x_2 \\in X$.\n*   **Condition on X**: From the definition of a metric, $d(x_1, x_2) = 0$ if and only if $x_1 = x_2$. For this to hold for all pairs of points in $X$, $X$ must contain only one point.\n*   **The Minimal Case**: Let's choose $X$ to be a single-point space, $X = \\{x_0\\}$. This is a finite ultrametric space with the metric $d(x_0, x_0) = 0$.\n*   **Counting the Embeddings**: For $X = \\{x_0\\}$ and $B = \\{0\\}$, the only map is $f(x_0) = 0$. This map is an isometric embedding because $\\|f(x_0) - f(x_0)\\| = \\|0-0\\| = 0$ and $d(x_0, x_0) = 0$. There is exactly one such embedding.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nWe have found a pair $(X, B)$—namely, $X$ being a single-point space and $B$ being the trivial Banach space $\\{0\\}$—for which the number of isometric embeddings is exactly 1.\n\nBased on the analysis:\n1.  The absolute smallest possible number of embeddings is 0, as some spaces cannot be embedded in others.\n2.  If we exclude cases with zero embeddings (a common practice for such questions), the number of embeddings is infinite for any non-trivial Banach space.\n3.  A finite, non-zero number of embeddings is only possible if the Banach space is the trivial space $B=\\{0\\}$. In this case, an embedding exists only if $X$ is a single-point space, and the number of embeddings is exactly 1.\n\nTherefore, the smallest possible *positive* number of isometric embeddings is 1. Given the phrasing, this is the most reasonable interpretation of the question.\n\n<<<1>>>"
