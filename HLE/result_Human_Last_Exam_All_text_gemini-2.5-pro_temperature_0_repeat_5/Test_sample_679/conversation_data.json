    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the IUPAC name of the compound.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Molecular Formula**\n*   The molecular formula is $C_7H_{14}$.\n*   To determine the degree of unsaturation (DoU), we use the formula: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2).\n*   DoU = 7 + 1 - (14/2) = 8 - 7 = 1.\n*   A DoU of 1 indicates the presence of either one double bond or one ring in the structure.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the $^{13}C$ NMR Data**\nThe provided data is: 145(s), 112(t), 48(t), 27(d), 22(q), 21(q).\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Number of Signals vs. Number of Carbons.**\n    *   There are 6 distinct signals in the spectrum.\n    *   The molecular formula has 7 carbon atoms.\n    *   This discrepancy means that two carbon atoms in the molecule are chemically equivalent, resulting in one overlapping signal.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Chemical Shifts and Functional Groups.**\n    *   The signals at 145 ppm and 112 ppm are in the typical range for sp$^2$ hybridized carbons of an alkene (100-150 ppm). This confirms the presence of a C=C double bond, which accounts for the DoU of 1. The compound is an alkene, not a cycloalkane.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Signal Multiplicity (DEPT information).**\n    *   The multiplicity tells us the number of hydrogens attached to each carbon:\n        *   (s) = singlet = Quaternary carbon (C, no H)\n        *   (d) = doublet = Methine carbon (CH)\n        *   (t) = triplet = Methylene carbon (CH$_2$)\n        *   (q) = quartet = Methyl carbon (CH$_3$)\n    *   Let's break down the signals:\n        *   **145 (s):** A quaternary carbon (C) in the alkene region. This is a carbon in the double bond with no hydrogens attached (>C=).\n        *   **112 (t):** A methylene carbon (CH$_2$) in the alkene region. This must be a terminal vinyl group (=CH$_2$).\n        *   **48 (t):** An aliphatic methylene carbon (CH$_2$).\n        *   **27 (d):** An aliphatic methine carbon (CH).\n        *   **22 (q):** An aliphatic methyl carbon (CH$_3$).\n        *   **21 (q):** Another aliphatic methyl carbon (CH$_3$).\n\n**Step 3: Identify All Fragments and Account for All Atoms**\n*   From the signals, we have the following fragments: one >C=, one =CH$_2$, one -CH$_2$-, one -CH<, and two -CH$_3$.\n*   Let's count the atoms from these 6 signals:\n    *   Carbons: 1(s) + 1(t) + 1(t) + 1(d) + 1(q) + 1(q) = 6 carbons.\n    *   Hydrogens: 0(s) + 2(t) + 2(t) + 1(d) + 3(q) + 3(q) = 11 hydrogens.\n*   We are missing 1 carbon and 3 hydrogens (C$_7$H$_{14}$ - C$_6$H$_{11}$ = CH$_3$).\n*   This means the overlapping signal must be a methyl group (CH$_3$), which has a quartet (q) multiplicity. Therefore, one of the quartet signals (at 22 or 21 ppm) represents two chemically equivalent methyl groups.\n*   Our final list of fragments is:\n    *   One >C=CH$_2$ unit (from 145 s and 112 t)\n    *   One -CH$_2$- group (from 48 t)\n    *   One -CH< group (from 27 d)\n    *   Three -CH$_3$ groups (from 22 q and 21 q, with one signal representing two equivalent methyls)\n\n**Step 4: Assemble the Structure**\n*   **Careful Point 4: Recognizing common structural motifs.** The presence of a methine (CH) group and two equivalent methyl (CH$_3$) groups strongly suggests an **isopropyl group**, -CH(CH$_3$)$_2$. This accounts for the CH at 27 ppm and the overlapping signal for two CH$_3$ groups.\n*   Let's see what fragments are left:\n    *   The >C=CH$_2$ unit.\n    *   The -CH$_2$- group.\n    *   One remaining -CH$_3$ group.\n*   These remaining fragments (-CH$_2$- and -CH$_3$) must form an **ethyl group**, -CH$_2$CH$_3$.\n*   Now we assemble the final pieces: the >C=CH$_2$ unit, the isopropyl group, and the ethyl group.\n*   The quaternary carbon (>C=) from the alkene unit needs to be bonded to two other groups. The only way to connect the isopropyl and ethyl groups is to attach them both to this quaternary carbon.\n*   The proposed structure is:\n    ```\n          CH3-CH2   CH(CH3)2\n                   \\ /\n                    C\n                    ||\n                    CH2\n    ```\n*   Let's verify this structure with the NMR data:\n    *   **=C<:** Quaternary (s), attached to three other carbons. Expected shift is high. **145 (s)** fits perfectly.\n    *   **=CH$_2$:** Methylene (t). **112 (t)** fits perfectly.\n    *   **-CH$_2$CH$_3$:** Methylene (t). It is allylic (adjacent to the double bond) and attached to a substituted sp$^2$ carbon, which causes a significant downfield shift. **48 (t)** is a reasonable value for this environment.\n    *   **-CH(CH$_3$)$_2$:** Methine (d). It is also allylic. **27 (d)** is a good fit.\n    *   **-CH(CH$_3$)$_2$:** The two methyl groups are equivalent. They are quartets (q). **22 (q)** or **21 (q)** fits.\n    *   **-CH$_2$CH$_3$:** The terminal methyl group. It is a quartet (q). **22 (q)** or **21 (q)** fits.\n    *   The structure is fully consistent with all the data.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the IUPAC Name**\n*   **Careful Point 5: Applying IUPAC Naming Rules for Alkenes.**\n    1.  Find the longest continuous carbon chain that *includes* both carbons of the double bond.\n        *   Structure: CH$_3$-CH$_2$-C(=CH$_2$)-CH(CH$_3$)$_2$\n        *   There are two possible chains of equal length (4 carbons):\n            *   Chain A: CH$_2$=C(-CH(CH$_3$)$_2$)-CH$_2$-CH$_3$ (Parent: but-1-ene)\n            *   Chain B: CH$_2$=C(-CH$_2$CH$_3$)-CH(CH$_3$)-CH$_3$ (Parent: but-1-ene)\n    2.  If there is a choice, select the chain with the maximum number of substituents.\n        *   Chain A has one substituent: an isopropyl group.\n        *   Chain B has two substituents: an ethyl group and a methyl group.\n        *   Therefore, we must choose Chain B.\n    3.  Number the chain starting from the end that gives the double bond the lowest possible number. The double bond starts at C1.\n        ```\n              CH3 (substituent)\n              |\n        CH2 = C -- CH -- CH3  (Main chain: 4 carbons)\n              |\n              CH2-CH3 (substituent)\n        ```\n        Numbering: C1(=CH$_2$)-C2-C3-C4\n    4.  Identify and name the substituents.\n        *   An ethyl group is on C2.\n        *   A methyl group is on C3.\n    5.  Assemble the name, listing substituents alphabetically.\n        *   2-ethyl\n        *   3-methyl\n        *   but-1-ene\n*   The final IUPAC name is **2-ethyl-3-methylbut-1-ene**.\n\n<<<2-ethyl-3-methylbut-1-ene>>>"
