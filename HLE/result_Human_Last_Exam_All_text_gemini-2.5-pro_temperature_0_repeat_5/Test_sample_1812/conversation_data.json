    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the determinant of the given matrix.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the core task and the given matrix**\n\nThe problem asks us to compute the determinant of a specific matrix, which is provided in the question. The matrix is:\n\\[\nA = \\begin{bmatrix} \n2 & -1 & -1 \\\\ \n-1 & 2 & -1 \\\\ \n-1 & -1 & 2 \n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nThe context \"adjacency matrix of the Markov quiver for \\( m_{1/2} = 13 \\)\" serves to identify the matrix in a specific mathematical context, but the matrix `A` whose determinant we need to compute is explicitly given. Therefore, our primary task is to calculate det(A).\n\n**Step 2: Choose a method to compute the determinant**\n\nThere are several methods to compute the determinant of a 3x3 matrix. We can use:\n1.  The Sarrus' rule (the standard formula for 3x3 determinants).\n2.  Row or column operations to simplify the matrix into a triangular form.\n3.  Checking for linear dependence among the rows or columns.\n\nWe will use Method 3 as it is often the quickest, and then verify with Method 1.\n\n**Step 3: Analysis using linear dependence of rows/columns**\n\nA fundamental property of determinants is that if the rows or columns of a matrix are linearly dependent, its determinant is zero. Let's examine the rows and columns of matrix `A`.\n\n*   Let \\(R_1, R_2, R_3\\) be the row vectors of `A`:\n    *   \\(R_1 = [2, -1, -1]\\)\n    *   \\(R_2 = [-1, 2, -1]\\)\n    *   \\(R_3 = [-1, -1, 2]\\)\n\n*   Let's compute the sum of the row vectors:\n    \\(R_1 + R_2 + R_3 = [2 + (-1) + (-1), -1 + 2 + (-1), -1 + (-1) + 2]\\)\n    \\(R_1 + R_2 + R_3 = [0, 0, 0]\\)\n\nSince the sum of the row vectors is the zero vector, the rows are linearly dependent. A matrix with linearly dependent rows is singular, and its determinant is 0.\n\n*   **Careful Point:** The same dependency exists for the columns. The sum of the three column vectors is also the zero vector. This confirms the linear dependence. This property means that the vector \\((1, 1, 1)\\) is in the null space of the matrix `A`, which implies that 0 is an eigenvalue of `A`, and thus the determinant (which is the product of eigenvalues) must be 0.\n\n**Step 4: Verification using the Sarrus' Rule**\n\nThe formula for the determinant of a 3x3 matrix\n\\[\nB = \\begin{bmatrix} \na & b & c \\\\ \nd & e & f \\\\ \ng & h & i \n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nis det(B) = \\(a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg)\\).\n\nFor our matrix `A`:\n*   a = 2, b = -1, c = -1\n*   d = -1, e = 2, f = -1\n*   g = -1, h = -1, i = 2\n\nLet's substitute these values into the formula:\ndet(A) = \\(2 \\cdot ((2)(2) - (-1)(-1)) - (-1) \\cdot ((-1)(2) - (-1)(-1)) + (-1) \\cdot ((-1)(-1) - (2)(-1))\\)\ndet(A) = \\(2 \\cdot (4 - 1) - (-1) \\cdot (-2 - 1) + (-1) \\cdot (1 - (-2))\\)\ndet(A) = \\(2 \\cdot (3) + 1 \\cdot (-3) - 1 \\cdot (1 + 2)\\)\ndet(A) = \\(6 - 3 - 1 \\cdot (3)\\)\ndet(A) = \\(6 - 3 - 3\\)\ndet(A) = 0\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion**\n\nBoth methods confirm that the determinant of the matrix `A` is 0. The information about the Markov quiver, while providing context for the origin of this matrix (it is the Cartan matrix for the affine Lie algebra \\(\\tilde{A}_2\\)), does not alter the calculation for the explicitly provided matrix.\n\nThe final answer is the value of the determinant.\n\n<<<0>>>"
