    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the value of \\(av_{333}^3(1324)\\).\n\n### Step 1: Understand the notation\nThe notation \\(av_n^k(\\sigma)\\) represents the number of permutations of length \\(n\\) that have exactly \\(k\\) inversions and avoid the pattern \\(\\sigma\\).\nIn this problem, we need to find \\(av_{333}^3(1324)\\), which is the number of permutations of length \\(n=333\\) with exactly \\(k=3\\) inversions that avoid the pattern \\(\\sigma=1324\\).\n\nA permutation \\(\\pi\\) avoids the pattern 1324 if there are no indices \\(i_1 < i_2 < i_3 < i_4\\) such that \\(\\pi(i_1) < \\pi(i_3) < \\pi(i_2) < \\pi(i_4)\\).\n\n### Step 2: Classify permutations with 3 inversions\nWe need to find all possible structures of permutations in \\(S_n\\) that have exactly 3 inversions. A permutation with a small number of inversions can be formed by slightly disordering the identity permutation \\(1, 2, ..., n\\). The permutations with 3 inversions can be classified into the following disjoint types based on the structure of the elements that are not in their natural position. For \\(n \\ge 6\\), the classification is as follows:\n\n*   **Type A:** Permutations that are the identity except for a block of three adjacent elements which are completely reversed.\n    \\(\\pi = 1... (i-1) (i+2)(i+1)i (i+3) ... n\\).\n    The inversions are \\((\\pi(i), \\pi(i+1))\\), \\((\\pi(i), \\pi(i+2))\\), and \\((\\pi(i+1), \\pi(i+2))\\).\n    The position \\(i\\) can range from \\(1\\) to \\(n-2\\). There are \\(n-2\\) such permutations.\n\n*   **Type B:** Permutations that are the identity except for a block of four elements permuted in the `4123` pattern.\n    \\(\\pi = 1... (j-4) j(j-3)(j-2)(j-1) (j+1) ... n\\).\n    The inversions are \\((\\pi(j-3), \\pi(j-2))\\), \\((\\pi(j-3), \\pi(j-1))\\), and \\((\\pi(j-3), \\pi(j))\\).\n    The value \\(j\\) can range from \\(4\\) to \\(n\\). There are \\(n-3\\) such permutations.\n\n*   **Type C:** Permutations that are the identity except for a block of four elements permuted in the `2341` pattern.\n    \\(\\pi = 1... (j-1) (j+1)(j+2)(j+3)j (j+4) ... n\\).\n    The inversions are \\((\\pi(j), \\pi(j+3))\\), \\((\\pi(j+1), \\pi(j+3))\\), and \\((\\pi(j+2), \\pi(j+3))\\).\n    The value \\(j\\) can range from \\(1\\) to \\(n-3\\). There are \\(n-3\\) such permutations.\n\n*   **Type D:** Permutations consisting of three disjoint adjacent transpositions (swaps).\n    \\(\\pi = ... (i+1)i ... (j+1)j ... (k+1)k ...\\) where the three swaps are at non-overlapping positions.\n    The number of such permutations is \\(\\binom{n-3}{3}\\).\n\n*   **Type E:** Permutations that are the identity except for a block of four elements permuted in the `2413` pattern.\n    \\(\\pi = 1... (i-1) (i+1)(i+3)i(i+2) (i+4) ... n\\).\n    The inversions are \\((\\pi(i), \\pi(i+2))\\), \\((\\pi(i+1), \\pi(i+2))\\), and \\((\\pi(i+1), \\pi(i+3))\\).\n    The position \\(i\\) can range from \\(1\\) to \\(n-3\\). There are \\(n-3\\) such permutations.\n\n*   **Type F:** Permutations that are the identity except for a block of four elements permuted in the `3142` pattern.\n    \\(\\pi = 1... (i-1) (i+2)i(i+3)(i+1) (i+4) ... n\\).\n    The inversions are \\((\\pi(i), \\pi(i+1))\\), \\((\\pi(i), \\pi(i+3))\\), and \\((\\pi(i+2), \\pi(i+3))\\).\n    The position \\(i\\) can range from \\(1\\) to \\(n-3\\). There are \\(n-3\\) such permutations.\n\nFor \\(n=333\\), all these types are possible.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze each type for the 1324 pattern\nNow we check each type of permutation to see which ones avoid the 1324 pattern.\n\n*   **Type A:** \\(\\pi = 1... (i+2)(i+1)i ...n\\).\n    If \\(1 < i < n-2\\), we can form a 1324 pattern. For example, with indices \\(i_1=i-1, i_2=i, i_3=i+1, i_4=i+3\\), the values are \\(\\pi(i_1)=i-1, \\pi(i_2)=i+2, \\pi(i_3)=i+1, \\pi(i_4)=i+3\\). The values \\(i-1, i+1, i+2, i+3\\) form a 1324 pattern.\n    This pattern is avoided only at the boundaries:\n    1.  When \\(i=1\\): \\(\\pi = 3,2,1,4,5,...,n\\). This permutation avoids 1324.\n    2.  When \\(i=n-2\\): \\(\\pi = 1,2,...,n-3,n,n-1,n-2\\). This permutation avoids 1324.\n    So, there are **2** avoiding permutations of Type A.\n\n*   **Type B:** \\(\\pi = 1... j(j-3)(j-2)(j-1) ...n\\).\n    If \\(4 < j < n\\), a 1324 pattern can be formed. For example, with indices \\(i_1=1, i_2=j-3, i_3=j-2, i_4=j+1\\), the values are \\(\\pi(i_1)=1, \\pi(i_2)=j, \\pi(i_3)=j-3, \\pi(i_4)=j+1\\). The values \\(1, j-3, j, j+1\\) form a 1324 pattern.\n    This pattern is avoided only at the boundaries:\n    1.  When \\(j=4\\): \\(\\pi = 4,1,2,3,5,...,n\\). This avoids 1324.\n    2.  When \\(j=n\\): \\(\\pi = 1,2,...,n-4,n,n-3,n-2,n-1\\). This avoids 1324.\n    So, there are **2** avoiding permutations of Type B.\n\n*   **Type C:** \\(\\pi = 1... (j+1)(j+2)(j+3)j ...n\\).\n    If \\(1 < j < n-3\\), a 1324 pattern can be formed. For example, with indices \\(i_1=j-1, i_2=j, i_3=j+3, i_4=j+4\\), the values are \\(\\pi(i_1)=j-1, \\pi(i_2)=j+1, \\pi(i_3)=j, \\pi(i_4)=j+4\\). The values \\(j-1, j, j+1, j+4\\) form a 1324 pattern.\n    This pattern is avoided only at the boundaries:\n    1.  When \\(j=1\\): \\(\\pi = 2,3,4,1,5,...,n\\). This avoids 1324.\n    2.  When \\(j=n-3\\): \\(\\pi = 1,2,...,n-4,n-2,n-1,n,n-3\\). This avoids 1324.\n    So, there are **2** avoiding permutations of Type C.\n\n*   **Type D:** Three disjoint adjacent transpositions.\n    Any such permutation contains a 1324 pattern. For example, let the swaps be at positions \\(i, j, k\\) with \\(i+1 < j\\) and \\(j+1 < k\\). The indices \\(i, j, j+1, k\\) and their corresponding values \\(\\pi(i)=i+1, \\pi(j)=j+1, \\pi(j+1)=j, \\pi(k)=k+1\\) form a 1324 pattern.\n    So, there are **0** avoiding permutations of Type D.\n\n*   **Type E:** \\(\\pi = 1... (i+1)(i+3)i(i+2) ...n\\).\n    If \\(i < n-3\\), a 1324 pattern can be formed. For example, with indices \\(i_1=i, i_2=i+1, i_3=i+3, i_4=i+4\\), the values are \\(\\pi(i_1)=i+1, \\pi(i_2)=i+3, \\pi(i_3)=i+2, \\pi(i_4)=i+4\\). The values \\(i+1, i+2, i+3, i+4\\) form a 1324 pattern.\n    This pattern is avoided only at the boundary:\n    1.  When \\(i=n-3\\): \\(\\pi = 1,2,...,n-4, n-2,n,n-3,n-1\\). This permutation avoids 1324.\n    The other boundary case \\(i=1\\) contains a 1324 pattern for \\(n \\ge 5\\).\n    So, there is **1** avoiding permutation of Type E.\n\n*   **Type F:** \\(\\pi = 1... (i+2)i(i+3)(i+1) ...n\\).\n    For \\(n \\ge 5\\), any such permutation contains a 1324 pattern. For \\(i>1\\), one can use indices \\(i-1, i, i+1, i+2\\). For \\(i=1\\), one can use indices \\(2, 3, 4, 5\\).\n    So, there are **0** avoiding permutations of Type F.\n\n### Step 4: Sum the results\nThe total number of 1324-avoiding permutations of length \\(n=333\\) with \\(k=3\\) inversions is the sum of the counts from each type:\nTotal = (from Type A) + (from Type B) + (from Type C) + (from Type D) + (from Type E) + (from Type F)\nTotal = 2 + 2 + 2 + 0 + 1 + 0 = 7.\n\nThe value of \\(n=333\\) is large enough for all the boundary conditions and general case analyses to hold.\n\nThe final answer is 7.\n\n<<<7>>>"
