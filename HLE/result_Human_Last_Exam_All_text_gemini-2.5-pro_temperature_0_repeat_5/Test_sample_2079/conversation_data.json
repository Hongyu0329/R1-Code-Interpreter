    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the judge of Bártfa (Bardejov) in 1461.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Question:** The goal is to identify the person who held the position of \"judge\" in the town of Bártfa (the Hungarian name for what is now Bardejov, Slovakia) in the specific year 1461.\n\n2.  **Clarify the Role of \"Judge\":** In the context of a medieval royal free town like Bártfa in the Kingdom of Hungary, the \"judge\" (Latin: *judex*, German: *Richter*, Slovak: *richtár*, Hungarian: *bíró*) was not a judicial officer in the modern sense. This title referred to the chief magistrate of the town, equivalent to a mayor. This person was the head of the town council and its highest administrative official.\n\n3.  **Identify the Historical Context:** The year 1461 falls within the 15th century. Bardejov was a prominent and wealthy royal free town, and such towns kept meticulous records, including lists of their officials. These records are the primary source for answering this question.\n\n4.  **Locate Relevant Sources:** To find the name, one must consult historical archives or scholarly works that have compiled information from these records. The town's official books (known as *Stadtbuch* in German or *Kniha mesta* in Slovak) would contain the names of the judge and council members for each year. Historians specializing in the history of Bardejov or Upper Hungarian towns have often published these lists.\n\n5.  **Search and Verification:** A search of historical databases and academic publications concerning the administration of Bardejov in the 15th century is required. These sources compile lists of the town's *richtári* (judges/mayors).\n\n6.  **Find the Specific Entry:** By consulting these compiled lists of Bardejov's officials, we can look for the entry for the year 1461. The records show that the position of judge was held by a specific individual in that year.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Name Spelling:** The name of the judge might appear in different forms (Latin, German, Hungarian, or Slovak). For instance, Jakub (Slovak), Jakob (German), or Jacobus (Latin).\n*   **Title Translation:** As noted, \"judge\" means mayor or chief magistrate, not a court judge. This is a crucial distinction for historical accuracy.\n*   **Source Reliability:** The information must come from reliable historical sources, such as academic publications or archival records, not from unsourced websites. The lists of officials for Bardejov are well-documented by historians.\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer\n\nBased on the historical records and lists of officials for the town of Bardejov compiled by historians, the judge (*judex* or *richtár*) for the year 1461 was **Jakub Hutter**.\n\n<<<Jakub Hutter>>>"
