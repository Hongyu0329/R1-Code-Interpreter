Yes. The Generality Constraint requires that understanding a proposition `Fa` involves possessing a separable concept of the property `F`. This separable concept `F` is then available as an input for other conceptual operations. Since you are assumed to understand universal quantification (`∀x`), you possess the conceptual operation that takes a property as input to form a general proposition. Therefore, you have all the necessary conceptual components and the ability to combine them, meaning you should be able to understand `∀x Fx`.
