1.  **Perform a Paired Differential Expression (DE) Analysis:** Using your raw gene count matrix, run a DE analysis with a tool like DESeq2 or edgeR. Critically, model the paired nature of your experiment by including the donor information in the design formula (e.g., `~ donor + condition`). Set the comparison to identify genes upregulated in the `CAR-T only` condition relative to the `CAR-T + IL15` condition.

2.  **Identify Contaminant Genes based on LFC and Significance:** From the DE analysis output, filter for genes that meet two criteria:
    *   A large positive log2 fold change (LFC). Start with a stringent threshold, for example: `log2FoldChange > 5`.
    *   A high statistical significance, for example: `padj < 0.01`.
    The genes that satisfy both criteria are your list of highly probable cancer cell contaminants.

3.  **Create a Gene Blacklist:** Extract the gene identifiers (e.g., Ensembl IDs or Gene Symbols) from the filtered list generated in Step 2. Save this list to a plain text file (e.g., `contaminant_blacklist.txt`). This file will contain one gene ID per line.

4.  **Filter the Original Count Matrix:** Use a command-line script (e.g., using `grep`, `awk`, or a simple Python/R script) to remove all rows from your original, full count matrix that correspond to the gene IDs in your `contaminant_blacklist.txt` file. This creates a new, clean count matrix.

5.  **Perform Final Biological Analysis:** Use the new, filtered count matrix from Step 4 as the input for your definitive downstream analyses. Re-run the paired differential expression analysis on this clean data to accurately identify the true transcriptional differences between your CAR-T only and CAR-T + IL15 cells without the confounding effect of the contamination.
