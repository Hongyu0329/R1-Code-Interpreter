    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the specific products in question.**\nThe request is to compare the imprints on two specific medications:\n1.  Teva brand fluoxetine 10mg capsules.\n2.  Teva brand fluoxetine 20mg capsules.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the constraints and exclusions.**\nThe analysis must focus only on the *numbers* imprinted on the capsules. The following information must be explicitly excluded from the final answer:\n*   Color differences.\n*   The word \"PLIVA\".\n*   Size differences.\n\n**Step 3: Research the imprint for the Teva brand fluoxetine 10mg capsule.**\nBy consulting reliable drug identification databases (such as the FDA's National Drug Code Directory or Drugs.com), we can find the official imprint for this specific capsule. The imprint is \"TEVA 3108\".\n\n**Step 4: Isolate the number from the 10mg capsule's imprint.**\nThe full imprint is \"TEVA 3108\". According to the question's constraints, we must only consider the numerical part. Therefore, the number for the 10mg capsule is **3108**.\n\n**Step 5: Research the imprint for the Teva brand fluoxetine 20mg capsule.**\nUsing the same reliable sources, we find the official imprint for the 20mg version of the Teva fluoxetine capsule. The imprint is \"TEVA 3109\".\n\n**Step 6: Isolate the number from the 20mg capsule's imprint.**\nThe full imprint is \"TEVA 3109\". Following the instructions, we isolate the numerical part. The number for the 20mg capsule is **3109**.\n\n**Step 7: Final Comparison and Answer Formulation.**\nBy comparing the numbers isolated in the previous steps, we can identify the different numbers imprinted on the two capsules.\n*   Teva fluoxetine 10mg has the number **3108**.\n*   Teva fluoxetine 20mg has the number **3109**.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n*   **Brand Specificity:** It is crucial to only look at \"Teva\" brand products, as other manufacturers (e.g., Sandoz, Dexcel) use entirely different imprint codes for their fluoxetine capsules.\n*   **Adherence to Exclusions:** The prompt strictly forbids mentioning color, size, or the word \"PLIVA\". The analysis must carefully filter out this information.\n*   **Focus on \"Numbers\":** The question asks for the \"numbers\", not the full imprint code. This means text like \"TEVA\" must be omitted from the final answer.\n\n<<<The number imprinted on the 10mg capsule is 3108, and the number imprinted on the 20mg capsule is 3109.>>>"
