    "An internal adjunction in a 2-category is a pair of 1-morphisms $L: A \\to B$ and $R: B \\to A$ equipped with 2-morphisms (the unit and counit) $\\eta: \\mathrm{id}_A \\to R \\circ L$ and $\\epsilon: L \\circ R \\to \\mathrm{id}_B$ that satisfy the triangle identities. We are asked to find the number of such adjunctions from $[23]$ to $[37]$ in the simplex category $\\Delta$.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the structure of $\\Delta$ as a locally posetal 2-category.**\n*   **Objects:** The objects are the finite ordinals $[k] = \\{0, 1, \\dots, k\\}$ for $k \\ge 0$.\n*   **1-morphisms:** A 1-morphism $f: [m] \\to [n]$ is an order-preserving map, meaning if $i \\le j$ in $[m]$, then $f(i) \\le f(j)$ in $[n]$.\n*   **2-morphisms:** For any two parallel 1-morphisms $f, g: [m] \\to [n]$, there is a unique 2-morphism $f \\Rightarrow g$ if and only if $f(i) \\le g(i)$ for all $i \\in [m]$. This defines a partial order on the set of morphisms $\\Delta([m], [n])$, making $\\Delta$ a locally posetal 2-category.\n\n**Step 2: Translate the definition of an adjunction into this specific context.**\nAn adjunction from $[m]$ to $[n]$ consists of:\n*   A left adjoint 1-morphism $L: [m] \\to [n]$.\n*   A right adjoint 1-morphism $R: [n] \\to [m]$.\n*   A unit 2-morphism $\\eta: \\mathrm{id}_{[m]} \\Rightarrow R \\circ L$. This translates to the inequality $\\mathrm{id}_{[m]}(i) \\le (R \\circ L)(i)$ for all $i \\in [m]$, which is $i \\le R(L(i))$.\n*   A counit 2-morphism $\\epsilon: L \\circ R \\Rightarrow \\mathrm{id}_{[n]}$. This translates to the inequality $(L \\circ R)(j) \\le \\mathrm{id}_{[n]}(j)$ for all $j \\in [n]$, which is $L(R(j)) \\le j$.\n\nIn a locally posetal 2-category, the triangle identities for the unit and counit are automatically satisfied if they exist. The two inequalities, $i \\le R(L(i))$ and $L(R(j)) \\le j$, define what is known as a Galois connection between the posets $[m]$ and $[n]$. This is equivalent to the condition that for all $i \\in [m]$ and $j \\in [n]$:\n$L(i) \\le j \\iff i \\le R(j)$.\n\n**Step 3: Characterize the left adjoints $L: [m] \\to [n]$.**\nAn adjunction is uniquely determined by its left adjoint $L$ (or its right adjoint $R$). We can count the number of possible left adjoints. A map between posets is a left adjoint if and only if it preserves all suprema (joins).\n\nThe poset $[m]$ is a complete lattice. Its suprema are given by:\n*   For a non-empty subset $S \\subseteq [m]$, $\\sup(S) = \\max(S)$.\n*   For the empty set, $\\sup(\\emptyset) = 0$ (the bottom element of $[m]$).\n\nFor an order-preserving map $L: [m] \\to [n]$ to be a left adjoint, it must satisfy:\n1.  $L(\\sup \\emptyset) = \\sup(L(\\emptyset))$. In our context, $L(\\emptyset)$ is the empty set in $[n]$. So, this condition becomes $L(0) = \\sup(\\emptyset) = 0$.\n2.  For any non-empty $S \\subseteq [m]$, $L(\\sup S) = \\sup(L(S))$. This means $L(\\max S) = \\max(L(S))$. Since $L$ is order-preserving, for any $s \\in S$, we have $s \\le \\max S$, which implies $L(s) \\le L(\\max S)$. This means $L(\\max S)$ is an upper bound for the set $L(S)$, so $\\max(L(S)) \\le L(\\max S)$. Thus, the condition $L(\\max S) = \\max(L(S))$ is always satisfied for any order-preserving map.\n\nTherefore, an order-preserving map $L: [m] \\to [n]$ is a left adjoint if and only if it satisfies the single condition $L(0) = 0$.\n\n**Step 4: Count the number of such left adjoints.**\nWe need to count the number of order-preserving maps $L: [m] \\to [n]$ such that $L(0)=0$. An order-preserving map is defined by a non-decreasing sequence of values $L(0), L(1), \\dots, L(m)$.\nThe condition is $0 = L(0) \\le L(1) \\le L(2) \\le \\dots \\le L(m) \\le n$.\nThis is equivalent to choosing a non-decreasing sequence of $m$ values $L(1), \\dots, L(m)$ from the set $[n] = \\{0, 1, \\dots, n\\}$. The size of this set is $n+1$.\n\nThis is a classic stars-and-bars problem, equivalent to choosing $m$ items from $n+1$ categories with replacement. The number of ways to do this is given by the multiset coefficient formula $\\binom{s+k-1}{k}$, where $s$ is the number of categories and $k$ is the number of items.\n*   Number of items to choose, $k = m$.\n*   Number of categories to choose from, $s = n+1$.\n\nThe number of such maps is $\\binom{(n+1)+m-1}{m} = \\binom{n+m}{m}$.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the final answer.**\nThe question asks for the number of internal adjunctions from $[23]$ to $[37]$. So we have $m=23$ and $n=37$.\nPlugging these values into the formula, we get:\nNumber of adjunctions = $\\binom{37+23}{23} = \\binom{60}{23}$.\n\nThis binomial coefficient represents the total number of possible internal adjunctions.\n\n$\\binom{60}{23} = \\frac{60!}{23!(60-23)!} = \\frac{60!}{23!37!}$\n\nThe question asks for the number, which is this value.\n\n<<<$\\binom{60}{23}$>>>"
