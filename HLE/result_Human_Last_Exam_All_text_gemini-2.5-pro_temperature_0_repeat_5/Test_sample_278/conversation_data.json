    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the area of the smallest square that outcircles the given figure.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the parametric curve in two parts.**\n\nThe curve is defined by $x = \\cos t$ and $y = b \\sin t$ for $t \\in [0, 2\\pi]$. The parameter $b$ changes based on the value of $t$.\n\n*   **Part 1: For $t \\in [0, \\pi]$**\n    *   In this interval, $b=1$. The equations are $x = \\cos t$ and $y = \\sin t$.\n    *   We can see that $x^2 + y^2 = \\cos^2 t + \\sin^2 t = 1$. This is the equation of a unit circle centered at the origin.\n    *   As $t$ goes from $0$ to $\\pi$, $y = \\sin t \\ge 0$. This means this part of the curve is the upper semi-circle of the unit circle.\n    *   The range of coordinates for this part are:\n        *   $x$ ranges from $\\cos(0)=1$ to $\\cos(\\pi)=-1$. So, $x \\in [-1, 1]$.\n        *   $y$ ranges from $\\sin(0)=0$ to a maximum of $\\sin(\\pi/2)=1$ and back to $\\sin(\\pi)=0$. So, $y \\in [0, 1]$.\n\n*   **Part 2: For $t \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$**\n    *   In this interval, $b=5$. The equations are $x = \\cos t$ and $y = 5 \\sin t$.\n    *   We can write this as $x^2 + (y/5)^2 = \\cos^2 t + \\sin^2 t = 1$. This is the equation of an ellipse centered at the origin with a semi-minor axis of 1 along the x-axis and a semi-major axis of 5 along the y-axis.\n    *   As $t$ goes from $\\pi$ to $2\\pi$, $y = 5 \\sin t \\le 0$. This means this part of the curve is the lower semi-ellipse.\n    *   The range of coordinates for this part are:\n        *   $x$ ranges from $\\cos(\\pi)=-1$ to $\\cos(2\\pi)=1$. So, $x \\in [-1, 1]$.\n        *   $y$ ranges from $5\\sin(\\pi)=0$ to a minimum of $5\\sin(3\\pi/2)=-5$ and back to $5\\sin(2\\pi)=0$. So, $y \\in [-5, 0]$.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the overall dimensions of the figure.**\n\nTo find the smallest square that outcircles the figure, we first need to find the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates of the entire figure. This will define the smallest bounding rectangle.\n\n*   **X-dimension (Width):**\n    *   From Part 1, the x-values are in the interval $[-1, 1]$.\n    *   From Part 2, the x-values are in the interval $[-1, 1]$.\n    *   Combining both parts, the overall range for $x$ is $[-1, 1]$.\n    *   The width of the figure is $x_{max} - x_{min} = 1 - (-1) = 2$.\n\n*   **Y-dimension (Height):**\n    *   From Part 1, the y-values are in the interval $[0, 1]$.\n    *   From Part 2, the y-values are in the interval $[-5, 0]$.\n    *   Combining both parts, the overall range for $y$ is $[-5, 1]$.\n    *   The height of the figure is $y_{max} - y_{min} = 1 - (-5) = 6$.\n\n**Step 3: Find the side length of the smallest outcircling square.**\n\nThe figure is contained within a rectangle of width 2 and height 6. A square that encloses this rectangle must have a side length that is at least as large as the largest dimension of the rectangle.\n\n*   Side length of the square = $\\max(\\text{width}, \\text{height})$\n*   Side length of the square = $\\max(2, 6) = 6$.\n\nTherefore, the smallest square that can outcircle the entire figure has a side length of 6.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the area of the square.**\n\nThe area of a square is the side length squared.\n\n*   Area = (Side length)Â²\n*   Area = $6^2 = 36$.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n1.  The parameter `b` is not constant, which means the curve is not a single simple shape. It's a composite figure.\n2.  The intervals for `t` are crucial. $[0, \\pi]$ for $\\sin t$ gives non-negative values (upper half), while $(\\pi, 2\\pi)$ gives non-positive values (lower half).\n3.  The smallest \"outcircling\" square is determined by the bounding box of the figure. The side of this square must be equal to the larger of the figure's width and height.\n4.  The final question asks for the area, not the side length. Ensure you square the side length for the final answer.\n\n<<<36>>>"
