    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the first Academy Award for Best Picture winner to depict a Luxor Obelisk on-screen.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe question has three key components:\n1.  **The film must have won the Academy Award for Best Picture.** This creates a specific, finite list of films to check.\n2.  **It must be the *first* one on that list to meet the criteria.** This means we must search chronologically from the first Best Picture winner (for 1927/28) onwards.\n3.  **The film must depict a Luxor Obelisk.** This is the visual requirement.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Luxor Obelisks and Their Locations**\nTo know what to look for, we must identify the Luxor Obelisks. Originally, a pair of obelisks stood at the entrance to the Luxor Temple in Egypt. Today, their locations are:\n*   One obelisk remains at the **Luxor Temple in Luxor, Egypt**.\n*   The other obelisk stands in the center of the **Place de la Concorde in Paris, France**. It was gifted to France in the 19th century.\n\nTherefore, a film can satisfy the condition by showing a scene set in either Luxor, Egypt (featuring the temple) or Paris, France (featuring the Place de la Concorde).\n\n**Step 3: Chronological Analysis of Best Picture Winners**\nWe will now go through the list of Best Picture winners in order, looking for films set in or featuring scenes in Paris or Luxor.\n\n*   **1920s-1930s:** Winners like *Wings* (1927/28), *All Quiet on the Western Front* (1929/30), and *The Life of Emile Zola* (1937) are set at least partially in France. However, a review of these films shows they do not feature clear, establishing shots of the Place de la Concorde. Their focus is on battlefields, interiors, or other parts of Paris. No winners from this era are set in Luxor.\n\n*   **1940s:**\n    *   ***Casablanca* (1943):** This film is a strong potential candidate. It features a famous flashback sequence set in Paris. However, the iconic shots in this montage are of the Arc de Triomphe and the Eiffel Tower. The Place de la Concorde and its obelisk are not shown.\n    *   Other winners of the 1940s like *Rebecca*, *How Green Was My Valley*, and *The Best Years of Our Lives* are not set in France or Egypt.\n\n*   **1950s:**\n    *   ***An American in Paris* (1951):** The title itself points to the correct location. The film is a musical romance set entirely in Paris and is famous for its vibrant depiction of the city. It features numerous shots of iconic Parisian landmarks. Crucially, the Place de la Concorde, with the Luxor Obelisk at its center, is clearly depicted on-screen. As this is the winner for 1951, it is the first film we have encountered that definitively meets the criteria.\n\n**Step 4: Confirming \"First\" Status**\nTo be certain that *An American in Paris* is the first, we must ensure no earlier film qualifies and consider prominent later films.\n*   **Earlier Films:** As established in Step 3, no winner before 1951 has a confirmed depiction of a Luxor Obelisk.\n*   **Later Films:**\n    *   ***Around the World in 80 Days* (1956):** This film features travel through both Paris and Egypt. However, the Paris scenes are brief, and the Egypt sequence is set in Suez, not Luxor. More importantly, it won five years *after* *An American in Paris*.\n    *   ***Lawrence of Arabia* (1962):** Features scenes in Cairo, but not Luxor.\n    *   ***Cleopatra* (1963):** This film was nominated for Best Picture but lost to *Tom Jones*. Therefore, it does not qualify as a Best Picture winner.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion**\nBased on the chronological analysis, *An American in Paris* (winner for the year 1951) is the first film that won the Academy Award for Best Picture to feature a Luxor Obelisk on-screen, specifically the one located in the Place de la Concorde in Paris.\n\n<<<An American in Paris>>>"
