    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the minimal number of generators of the fundamental group of the double branched cover of $S^4$ over the 5-twist-spun knot of the trefoil.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the manifold and its fundamental group**\n\nLet $M$ be the manifold in question. It is the 2-fold branched cover of the 4-sphere, $S^4$, over a branching locus $L$. The branching locus $L$ is the 5-twist-spun knot of the trefoil. Let $T$ denote the trefoil knot in $S^3$. The 5-twist-spun knot of the trefoil is a 2-sphere embedded in $S^4$, denoted $\\tau_5(T)$.\n\nA key result, established by Viro and cited by others (e.g., Budney and Gabai in \"Knotted 3-balls in $S^4$\"), provides a presentation for the fundamental group of such a branched cover.\n\n**Theorem:** Let $M_n(K)$ be the 2-fold cover of $S^4$ branched over the $n$-twist-spun knot of a knot $K \\subset S^3$. Then the fundamental group of $M_n(K)$ is given by:\n$$ \\pi_1(M_n(K)) \\cong \\pi_1(S^3 \\setminus K) / \\langle\\langle \\mu^n = 1 \\rangle\\rangle $$\nwhere $\\pi_1(S^3 \\setminus K)$ is the group of the knot $K$, $\\mu$ is a meridian of $K$, and $\\langle\\langle \\cdot \\rangle\\rangle$ denotes the normal closure of the relation.\n\nIn our case, the knot $K$ is the trefoil knot $T$, and the number of twists is $n=5$. So, the fundamental group of our manifold $M$ is:\n$$ G = \\pi_1(M) \\cong \\pi_1(S^3 \\setminus T) / \\langle\\langle \\mu^5 = 1 \\rangle\\rangle $$\n\n**Step 2: Find a presentation for the fundamental group G**\n\nFirst, we need a presentation for the group of the trefoil knot, $G_T = \\pi_1(S^3 \\setminus T)$. A standard presentation is:\n$$ G_T = \\langle x, y \\mid x^2 = y^3 \\rangle $$\nNext, we need to identify a meridian $\\mu$ in terms of these generators. The abelianization of $G_T$ is $H_1(S^3 \\setminus T) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$. The abelianization map sends $\\bar{x} \\mapsto 3$ and $\\bar{y} \\mapsto 2$ (or vice versa, up to sign). A meridian must map to a generator (i.e., $\\pm 1$) of this $\\mathbb{Z}$. Let's test the element $\\mu = x^{-1}y$. Its image in the abelianization is $-\\bar{x} + \\bar{y} = -3 + 2 = -1$. This is a generator, so $\\mu = x^{-1}y$ is a valid choice for a meridian.\n\nNow, we impose the relation $\\mu^5 = 1$ on $G_T$. This gives the presentation for our group $G$:\n$$ G = \\langle x, y \\mid x^2 = y^3, (x^{-1}y)^5 = 1 \\rangle $$\n\n**Step 3: Determine the minimal number of generators of G**\n\nThe minimal number of generators of a group $G$ is denoted by $d(G)$.\nFrom the presentation $G = \\langle x, y \\mid \\dots \\rangle$, we can see that the group can be generated by two elements, $x$ and $y$. Therefore, we have an upper bound:\n$$ d(G) \\le 2 $$\nTo find the minimal number, we need to determine if $G$ can be generated by one element or zero elements.\n*   $d(G)=0$ implies $G$ is the trivial group.\n*   $d(G)=1$ implies $G$ is a cyclic group.\n\nLet's analyze the group $G$. We can compute its abelianization, $G_{ab} = G/[G,G]$.\nThe relations in the abelian group $G_{ab}$ are:\n1.  $2\\bar{x} = 3\\bar{y}$\n2.  $5(-\\bar{x} + \\bar{y}) = 0$\n\nFrom the first relation, we can express $\\bar{x}$ and $\\bar{y}$ in terms of a single generator. Let $\\bar{m} = \\bar{y} - \\bar{x}$. Then the second relation is simply $5\\bar{m}=0$.\nFrom $\\bar{m} = \\bar{y} - \\bar{x}$, we have $\\bar{y} = \\bar{x} + \\bar{m}$. Substituting this into the first relation:\n$2\\bar{x} = 3(\\bar{x} + \\bar{m}) \\implies 2\\bar{x} = 3\\bar{x} + 3\\bar{m} \\implies \\bar{x} = -3\\bar{m}$.\nThen $\\bar{y} = -3\\bar{m} + \\bar{m} = -2\\bar{m}$.\nThe relations are satisfied for any choice of $\\bar{m}$ such that $5\\bar{m}=0$. The resulting group is generated by $\\bar{m}$ subject to this relation.\nSo, the abelianization of $G$ is:\n$$ G_{ab} \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_5 $$\nSince the abelianization is non-trivial, $G$ is not the trivial group, so $d(G) > 0$.\n\nNow we check if $G$ can be cyclic ($d(G)=1$).\nIf $G$ were cyclic, it would be abelian, and thus isomorphic to its abelianization. This would mean $G \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_5$.\nHowever, the group $G = \\langle x, y \\mid x^2 = y^3, (x^{-1}y)^5 = 1 \\rangle$ is known to be an infinite group. One way to see this is to change generators to $a=x$ and $b=x^{-1}y$. Then $y=xb=ab$. The relations become $a^2=(ab)^3$ and $b^5=1$. This group, $\\langle a, b \\mid a^2=(ab)^3, b^5=1 \\rangle$, is a well-known infinite group that surjects onto the finite icosahedral group $A_5$.\nSince $G$ is an infinite group, it cannot be isomorphic to the finite group $\\mathbb{Z}_5$. Therefore, $G$ is not cyclic.\n\nThis means that the minimal number of generators for $G$ must be greater than 1:\n$$ d(G) > 1 $$\n\n**Step 4: Conclude the minimal number of generators**\n\nWe have established two facts:\n1.  $d(G) \\le 2$\n2.  $d(G) > 1$\n\nCombining these, the only integer value for $d(G)$ is 2.\n\nThe minimal number of generators of the fundamental group of the double branched cover of $S^4$ over the 5-twist-spun knot of the trefoil is 2."
