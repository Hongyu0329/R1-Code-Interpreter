    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of power subgroups in the semidihedral group of size 512.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Group and the Question\n\n*   **The Group:** The group in question is the semidihedral group of size 512. The semidihedral group of order $2^n$, denoted $SD_{2^n}$, is defined for $n \\ge 4$.\n    *   The size is $512 = 2^9$, so we are dealing with $G = SD_{2^9}$. Here, $n=9$.\n    *   The presentation of this group is given by:\n        $G = \\langle r, s \\mid r^{2^{n-1}} = s^2 = 1, srs = r^{2^{n-2}-1} \\rangle$.\n    *   For $n=9$, this becomes:\n        $G = \\langle r, s \\mid r^{256} = s^2 = 1, srs = r^{127} \\rangle$.\n    *   The group $G$ has a maximal cyclic subgroup $\\langle r \\rangle$ of order $2^{n-1} = 256$. The elements of $G$ are of the form $r^i$ (for $0 \\le i < 256$) and $sr^i$ (for $0 \\le i < 256$).\n\n*   **The Question:** We need to find the number of \"power subgroups\" in $G$. The standard interpretation of \"the power subgroups of a group G\" is the set of subgroups of the form $G^k = \\langle g^k \\mid g \\in G \\rangle$ for integers $k$. The question asks for the number of distinct subgroups in this set, i.e., the size of $\\{G^k \\mid k \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}$.\n\n### Step 2: Simplify the Problem\n\n*   The set of subgroups $\\{G^k\\}$ forms a chain under inclusion. We need to find how many distinct subgroups are in this collection.\n*   The **exponent** of a group $G$, denoted $\\exp(G)$, is the smallest positive integer $m$ such that $g^m = 1$ for all $g \\in G$. For any integer $k$, the power subgroup $G^k$ is equal to $G^{\\gcd(k, \\exp(G))}$.\n*   Therefore, we only need to consider the subgroups $G^k$ where $k$ is a divisor of $\\exp(G)$.\n*   Let's find the exponent of $G = SD_{512}$. We need the orders of all elements.\n    *   The order of $r^i$ is $256/\\gcd(256, i)$. The maximum order is 256.\n    *   The order of elements of the form $sr^i$ needs to be calculated. Let's find the square of such an element:\n        $(sr^i)^2 = sr^i s r^i$.\n        From the relation $srs = r^{127}$, we can deduce $s r s^{-1} = r^{127}$. Since $s=s^{-1}$, we have $srs = r^{127}$.\n        Also, $sr^i s = (srs)^i = (r^{127})^i = r^{127i}$.\n        So, $(sr^i)^2 = (sr^i s) r^i = r^{127i} r^i = r^{128i}$.\n        The order of $(sr^i)^2$ is the order of $r^{128i}$, which is $\\frac{o(r)}{\\gcd(o(r), 128i)} = \\frac{256}{\\gcd(256, 128i)} = \\frac{256}{128\\gcd(2, i)}$.\n        *   If $i$ is odd, $\\gcd(2, i)=1$. The order of $(sr^i)^2$ is $256/128 = 2$. This means $(sr^i)^2 = r^{128}$ (the unique element of order 2 in $\\langle r \\rangle$). Then $(sr^i)^4 = (r^{128})^2 = 1$. So, $o(sr^i) = 4$.\n        *   If $i$ is even, $\\gcd(2, i)=2$. The order of $(sr^i)^2$ is $256/256 = 1$. This means $(sr^i)^2 = 1$. So, $o(sr^i) = 2$.\n    *   The orders of elements in $G$ are powers of 2, up to a maximum of 256 (the order of $r$).\n    *   The exponent of $G$ is $\\text{lcm}(\\text{orders of all elements}) = \\text{lcm}(1, 2, 4, \\dots, 256) = 256 = 2^8$.\n*   Since $\\exp(G) = 256$, we only need to find the distinct subgroups among $G^k$ for $k$ being the divisors of 256. The divisors are $2^j$ for $j = 0, 1, 2, \\dots, 8$.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Power Subgroups $G^{2^j}$\n\nWe will now compute the subgroups $G^{2^j}$ for $j=0, 1, \\dots, 8$.\n\n*   **For j=0:**\n    $G^{2^0} = G^1 = \\langle g^1 \\mid g \\in G \\rangle = G = SD_{512}$.\n\n*   **For j â‰¥ 1:**\n    $G^{2^j} = \\langle g^{2^j} \\mid g \\in G \\rangle$. The generators $g^{2^j}$ come from two types of elements $g$:\n    1.  **Powers of r:** For $g = r^i$, the powers are $(r^i)^{2^j} = r^{i \\cdot 2^j}$. As $i$ ranges from $0$ to $255$, these elements generate the cyclic subgroup $\\langle r^{2^j} \\rangle$.\n    2.  **Elements sr^i:** For $g = sr^i$, we need to compute $(sr^i)^{2^j}$. Since $j \\ge 1$, we can write $2^j = 2 \\cdot 2^{j-1}$.\n        $(sr^i)^{2^j} = ((sr^i)^2)^{2^{j-1}}$.\n        We found earlier that $(sr^i)^2 = r^{128i}$.\n        So, $(sr^i)^{2^j} = (r^{128i})^{2^{j-1}} = r^{128i \\cdot 2^{j-1}} = r^{i \\cdot 2^7 \\cdot 2^{j-1}} = r^{i \\cdot 2^{j+6}}$.\n        As $i$ ranges from $0$ to $255$, these elements generate the subgroup $\\langle r^{\\gcd(0, 2^{j+6}, 2 \\cdot 2^{j+6}, \\dots)} \\rangle = \\langle r^{2^{j+6}} \\rangle$.\n\n    Combining these two sets of generators, for $j \\ge 1$:\n    $G^{2^j} = \\langle \\langle r^{2^j} \\rangle, \\langle r^{2^{j+6}} \\rangle \\rangle = \\langle r^{2^j}, r^{2^{j+6}} \\rangle$.\n    Since $j \\ge 1$, we have $j+6 > j$. This means $r^{2^{j+6}}$ is a power of $r^{2^j}$ (specifically, $r^{2^{j+6}} = (r^{2^j})^{2^6}$). Therefore, the subgroup generated by both is simply the larger one.\n    $G^{2^j} = \\langle r^{2^j} \\rangle$.\n\n### Step 4: List the Distinct Subgroups and Count Them\n\nNow we list the subgroups we found:\n*   $j=0: G^1 = SD_{512}$\n*   $j=1: G^2 = \\langle r^2 \\rangle$\n*   $j=2: G^4 = \\langle r^4 \\rangle$\n*   $j=3: G^8 = \\langle r^8 \\rangle$\n*   $j=4: G^{16} = \\langle r^{16} \\rangle$\n*   $j=5: G^{32} = \\langle r^{32} \\rangle$\n*   $j=6: G^{64} = \\langle r^{64} \\rangle$\n*   $j=7: G^{128} = \\langle r^{128} \\rangle$\n*   $j=8: G^{256} = \\langle r^{256} \\rangle = \\{1\\}$ (the trivial subgroup)\n\nWe need to check if these 9 subgroups are distinct.\n*   $G^1 = SD_{512}$ is a non-abelian group of order 512.\n*   The other 8 subgroups, $G^{2^j} = \\langle r^{2^j} \\rangle$ for $j=1, \\dots, 8$, are all cyclic (and therefore abelian). So $G^1$ is distinct from the rest.\n*   Let's find the orders of these cyclic subgroups:\n    $|G^{2^j}| = |\\langle r^{2^j} \\rangle| = \\text{order of } r^{2^j} = \\frac{o(r)}{2^j} = \\frac{256}{2^j} = 2^{8-j}$.\n    *   $|G^2| = 2^7 = 128$\n    *   $|G^4| = 2^6 = 64$\n    *   ...\n    *   $|G^{128}| = 2^1 = 2$\n    *   $|G^{256}| = 2^0 = 1$\n*   Since all these 8 cyclic subgroups have different orders, they are all distinct from each other.\n\nThus, we have found 9 distinct subgroups in total: $SD_{512}$ and the 8 distinct cyclic subgroups $\\langle r^2 \\rangle, \\langle r^4 \\rangle, \\dots, \\langle r^{256} \\rangle$.\n\nThe total number of power subgroups is 9."
