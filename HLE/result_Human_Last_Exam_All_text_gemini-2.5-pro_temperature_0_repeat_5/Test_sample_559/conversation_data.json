    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the separatrix of the given system of differential equations.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the system of differential equations**\nThe system is given by:\n1.  $d'(t) = 2d^2(t) + (-3u(t) + 5u^2(t))d(t) - u(t)(1-u(t))u^2(t)$\n2.  $u'(t) = (u(t)-1)u^2(t)$\n\nWe are considering the phase plane for $u \\geq 0$.\n\n**Step 2: Find the equilibrium points**\nEquilibrium points (or critical points) are the points $(d, u)$ where both $d'(t)=0$ and $u'(t)=0$.\n\nFrom the second equation, $u'(t) = u^2(u-1) = 0$, we find the possible values for $u$:\n$u = 0$ or $u = 1$.\n\nNow we substitute these values into the first equation, $d'(t)=0$, to find the corresponding values for $d$.\n\n*   **Case 1: u = 0**\n    Substitute $u=0$ into the equation for $d'$:\n    $d' = 2d^2 + (-3(0) + 5(0)^2)d - 0^3(1-0) = 0$\n    $2d^2 = 0$\n    $d = 0$\n    So, one equilibrium point is **(0, 0)**.\n\n*   **Case 2: u = 1**\n    Substitute $u=1$ into the equation for $d'$:\n    $d' = 2d^2 + (-3(1) + 5(1)^2)d - 1^3(1-1) = 0$\n    $2d^2 + (2)d - 0 = 0$\n    $2d(d+1) = 0$\n    $d = 0$ or $d = -1$\n    So, two more equilibrium points are **(0, 1)** and **(-1, 1)**.\n\nIn summary, the equilibrium points in the region $u \\geq 0$ are (0, 0), (0, 1), and (-1, 1).\n\n**Step 3: Classify the equilibrium points**\nTo understand the behavior of the system, we classify these points by linearizing the system. We compute the Jacobian matrix $J(d, u)$.\nLet $f(d, u) = 2d^2 + (-3u + 5u^2)d - u^3 + u^4$ and $g(d, u) = u^3 - u^2$.\nThe Jacobian matrix is:\n$J(d, u) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial d} & \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial u} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial d} & \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial u} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 4d - 3u + 5u^2 & (-3+10u)d - 3u^2 + 4u^3 \\\\ 0 & 3u^2 - 2u \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n*   **At point (-1, 1):**\n    $J(-1, 1) = \\begin{pmatrix} 4(-1) - 3(1) + 5(1)^2 & (-3+10(1))(-1) - 3(1)^2 + 4(1)^3 \\\\ 0 & 3(1)^2 - 2(1) \\end{pmatrix}$\n    $J(-1, 1) = \\begin{pmatrix} -4 - 3 + 5 & (7)(-1) - 3 + 4 \\\\ 0 & 3 - 2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -2 & -6 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    The eigenvalues are the diagonal entries, $\\lambda_1 = -2$ and $\\lambda_2 = 1$. Since one eigenvalue is positive and the other is negative, the point **(-1, 1) is a saddle point**.\n\n*   **At point (0, 1):**\n    $J(0, 1) = \\begin{pmatrix} 4(0) - 3(1) + 5(1)^2 & (-3+10(1))(0) - 3(1)^2 + 4(1)^3 \\\\ 0 & 3(1)^2 - 2(1) \\end{pmatrix}$\n    $J(0, 1) = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & -3 + 4 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1 = 2$ and $\\lambda_2 = 1$. Since both are positive, the point **(0, 1) is an unstable node (source)**.\n\n*   **At point (0, 0):**\n    $J(0, 0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$. The linearization is inconclusive. This is a degenerate point.\n\n**Step 4: Find the separatrix**\nA separatrix is a trajectory that separates regions of different qualitative behavior. The stable and unstable manifolds of a saddle point are always separatrices. Our saddle point is at (-1, 1). We need to find its stable or unstable manifolds. These are special trajectories that either approach or leave the saddle point.\n\nLet's search for an invariant curve of the form $d = f(u)$ that passes through the saddle point (-1, 1). We can try a simple polynomial form, for instance, $d = au^2 + bu + c$.\nIf this is an invariant curve (a trajectory), then the relationship must hold for all time, so we can differentiate it with respect to $t$:\n$d' = (2au + b)u'$\nNow, substitute the expressions for $d'$, $u'$, and $d$:\n$(2au + b)(u^3 - u^2) = 2(au^2+bu+c)^2 + (-3u+5u^2)(au^2+bu+c) - u^3 + u^4$\n\nLet's expand both sides and compare the coefficients of the powers of $u$.\nLHS: $2au^4 + (b-2a)u^3 - bu^2$\nRHS: $2(a^2u^4 + 2abu^3 + (b^2+2ac)u^2 + \\dots) + (5au^4 + (5b-3a)u^3 + (5c-3b)u^2 + \\dots) - u^3 + u^4$\nRHS: $(2a^2+5a+1)u^4 + (4ab+5b-3a-1)u^3 + \\dots$\n\nComparing the coefficients of $u^4$:\n$2a = 2a^2 + 5a + 1 \\implies 2a^2 + 3a + 1 = 0 \\implies (2a+1)(a+1) = 0$\nThis gives two possible values for $a$: $a = -1$ or $a = -1/2$.\n\nLet's test $a = -1$:\nComparing the coefficients of $u^3$:\n$b - 2a = 4ab + 5b - 3a - 1$\n$b - 2(-1) = 4(-1)b + 5b - 3(-1) - 1$\n$b + 2 = -4b + 5b + 3 - 1$\n$b + 2 = b + 2$\nThis is an identity, which means our choice of $a=-1$ is consistent.\n\nNow let's try to find $b$ and $c$. Let's assume a simpler form $d = -u^2$. This corresponds to $a=-1, b=0, c=0$. Let's check if this is an invariant curve.\nSubstitute $d = -u^2$ into the original system's equation for $dd/du$:\n$\\frac{dd}{du} = \\frac{d'}{u'} = \\frac{2d^2 + (-3u + 5u^2)d - u^3(1-u)}{u^2(u-1)}$\nIf $d=-u^2$, then $dd/du = -2u$. So we need to check if:\n$-2u = \\frac{2(-u^2)^2 + (-3u + 5u^2)(-u^2) - u^3(1-u)}{u^2(u-1)}$\n$-2u(u^2(u-1)) = 2u^4 - u^2(-3u+5u^2) - u^3+u^4$\n$-2u^4 + 2u^3 = 2u^4 + 3u^3 - 5u^4 - u^3 + u^4$\n$-2u^4 + 2u^3 = (2-5+1)u^4 + (3-1)u^3$\n$-2u^4 + 2u^3 = -2u^4 + 2u^3$\nThis identity holds true. Therefore, the curve $d = -u^2$ is an invariant manifold (a trajectory) of the system.\n\n**Step 5: Verify that the curve is a separatrix**\nWe must check if this invariant curve passes through the saddle point (-1, 1).\nSubstitute $u=1$ into the equation $d = -u^2$:\n$d = -(1)^2 = -1$.\nThe curve passes through the point (-1, 1), which is our saddle point. An invariant curve passing through a saddle point is, by definition, part of its stable or unstable manifold, and is therefore a separatrix.\n\nThe curve $d = -u^2$ is the unstable manifold of the saddle point. It separates the phase plane into two regions with distinct long-term behaviors. For instance, it separates trajectories that are attracted towards the stable line $u=0$ from those that are repelled towards infinity.\n\nThus, the separatrix is the parabola given by the equation $d = -u^2$.\n\n<<<d = -u^2>>>"
