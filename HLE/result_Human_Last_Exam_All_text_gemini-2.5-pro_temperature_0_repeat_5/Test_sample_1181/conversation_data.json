    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe question asks to identify a specific character from Andrei Tarkovsky's 1972 film *Solaris*. The key detail is that this character expresses a specific sentiment: being \"ashamed to miss the sound of leaves rustling on Earth.\" This requires knowledge of the film's dialogue and character motivations.\n\n**Step 2: List Careful Points and Character Analysis**\n*   **Source Specificity:** The question is explicitly about the 1972 Tarkovsky film, not the Stanislaw Lem novel or the 2002 American remake. The dialogue and character emphasis can differ significantly between these versions. Tarkovsky's film, for instance, adds a lengthy prologue on Earth, making the theme of connection to one's home planet particularly strong.\n*   **Character Profiles:**\n    *   **A. Kris Kelvin:** The protagonist. The film begins with him on Earth, surrounded by nature. He is deeply connected to his past and the natural world. While he certainly misses Earth, the specific emotion of *shame* about missing it is the crucial detail to verify.\n    *   **B. Hari:** She is a \"visitor,\" a physical manifestation of Kris's memories of his deceased wife, created by the Solaris ocean. She has never been on Earth and has no authentic memories of it, so she cannot miss its sounds.\n    *   **C. Snaut:** A cyberneticist who has been on the station for a long time. He is weary, cynical, and philosophical. He often acts as a guide for Kris, explaining the strange phenomena. His long isolation makes him a plausible candidate for expressing deep-seated alienation from Earth.\n    *   **D. Sartorius:** A biologist who is cold, rational, and obsessed with studying the Solaris phenomenon scientifically. He is generally portrayed as detached from sentimentality and emotion, making it unlikely he would voice such a poetic and personal feeling of shame.\n    *   **E. Gibarian:** A friend of Kris who commits suicide before Kris arrives. We only see him in a recorded video message. His message is one of despair and warning, but it is focused on the immediate horror of the situation on the station.\n\n**Step 3: Acquiring the Answer Through Scene and Dialogue Analysis**\n1.  We can immediately eliminate **Hari (B)** as she is not from Earth. We can also consider **Sartorius (D)** highly unlikely due to his cold, scientific demeanor which is consistently maintained throughout the film.\n2.  The choice is primarily between Kris, Snaut, and Gibarian. While Gibarian expresses despair, his message doesn't contain this specific line. Kris is the character most connected to Earth, but his primary emotional turmoil revolves around Hari.\n3.  The sentiment is expressed during a long, philosophical conversation between Kris and Snaut in the station's library. Snaut is trying to explain the psychological toll that long-term space travel and the encounter with Solaris have taken on the crew.\n4.  In this scene, Snaut confesses his feelings of alienation. He says to Kris, \"We've lost our sense of the cosmic. In a situation like this, you begin to miss the most trivial, the most earthly things.\" He then pauses and admits, almost reluctantly, \"I don't know... I'm ashamed to say it, but I miss the sound of rustling leaves.\"\n5.  This dialogue directly matches the question. It is Dr. Snaut who explicitly states he is \"ashamed\" to miss this simple, natural sound from Earth, highlighting his profound sense of loss and disconnection from his own humanity.\n\n**Conclusion**\nBased on the specific dialogue from the film, the character who is ashamed to miss the sound of rustling leaves is Dr. Snaut.\n\n<<<C>>>"
