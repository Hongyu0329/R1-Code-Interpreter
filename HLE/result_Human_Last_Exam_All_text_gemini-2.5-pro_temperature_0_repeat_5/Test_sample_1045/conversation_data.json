    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of contracted Gaussian functions for a 6-31G calculation of toluene (C7H8).\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Identify the molecular formula and atom count.**\nThe molecule is toluene, which has the chemical formula C7H8.\n*   Number of Carbon (C) atoms = 7\n*   Number of Hydrogen (H) atoms = 8\n\n**Step 2: Understand the 6-31G basis set notation.**\nThe 6-31G basis set is a Pople-style split-valence basis set. The notation describes how atomic orbitals are represented by contracted Gaussian functions (CGFs). The interpretation depends on whether the atom is hydrogen or a \"heavy\" atom (like carbon).\n\n**Step 3: Determine the number of contracted Gaussian functions per Carbon (C) atom.**\nFor a second-row atom like Carbon, the 6-31G notation is interpreted as follows:\n*   **Core Orbitals (1s):** The '6' indicates that the core 1s orbital is represented by a single contracted Gaussian function (CGF), which is a linear combination of 6 primitive Gaussian functions (PGFs).\n    *   Contribution from core: 1 CGF.\n*   **Valence Orbitals (2s, 2p):** The '31' indicates that the valence orbitals are \"split\" into two parts (an inner and an outer part), each represented by a separate CGF.\n    *   **Inner Valence:** The '3' means the inner part of the valence orbitals is described by CGFs made from 3 PGFs each. This applies to the 2s and the three 2p (2px, 2py, 2pz) orbitals.\n        *   Contribution: 1 CGF for 2s + 3 CGFs for 2p = 4 CGFs.\n    *   **Outer Valence:** The '1' means the outer part of the valence orbitals is described by CGFs made from 1 PGF each (i.e., a single uncontracted Gaussian). This also applies to the 2s and the three 2p orbitals.\n        *   Contribution: 1 CGF for 2s + 3 CGFs for 2p = 4 CGFs.\n\n*   **Total for one Carbon atom:**\n    *   Number of functions for 1s orbital: 1\n    *   Number of functions for 2s orbital: 2 (one inner, one outer)\n    *   Number of functions for 2p orbitals: 2 sets of 3 (px,py,pz) = 6 (one inner set, one outer set)\n    *   Total CGFs per C atom = 1 (for 1s) + 2 (for 2s) + 6 (for 2p) = **9 CGFs**.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the number of contracted Gaussian functions per Hydrogen (H) atom.**\nFor a Hydrogen atom, there are no core electrons. The notation '31' applies directly to its single 1s valence orbital.\n*   **Valence Orbital (1s):** The '31' splits the 1s orbital into two CGFs.\n    *   **Inner part:** Represented by one CGF made from 3 PGFs.\n    *   **Outer part:** Represented by one CGF made from 1 PGF.\n*   **Total for one Hydrogen atom:**\n    *   Total CGFs per H atom = 1 (inner) + 1 (outer) = **2 CGFs**.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the total number of contracted Gaussian functions for the toluene molecule (C7H8).**\nNow, we sum the CGFs from all the atoms in the molecule.\n*   Total CGFs from Carbon = (Number of C atoms) × (CGFs per C atom)\n    *   7 × 9 = 63 CGFs\n*   Total CGFs from Hydrogen = (Number of H atoms) × (CGFs per H atom)\n    *   8 × 2 = 16 CGFs\n*   **Total for Toluene** = (Total from C) + (Total from H)\n    *   63 + 16 = **79 CGFs**\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Atom Identification:** Ensure the correct count of each type of atom in the molecule (7 Carbons, 8 Hydrogens).\n2.  **Basis Set Interpretation:** The main point of confusion can be how to interpret the Pople notation (X-YZG). It's crucial to remember that the interpretation differs for first-row atoms (H, He) and second-row atoms (Li-Ne).\n3.  **Core vs. Valence:** For heavy atoms like Carbon, the first number ('6') applies only to the non-valence core orbitals. The subsequent numbers ('31') apply to the valence orbitals.\n4.  **Split Valence:** The term \"split-valence\" means each valence atomic orbital (like 2s or 2p) is represented by more than one basis function (in this case, two: an inner and an outer one).\n5.  **p-Orbitals:** Remember that for each \"p\" shell, there are three orbitals (px, py, pz). So, when the valence p-shell is split, it contributes 2 × 3 = 6 functions, not just 2.\n\nBy carefully following these steps and points, we arrive at the final answer.\n\n<<<79>>>"
