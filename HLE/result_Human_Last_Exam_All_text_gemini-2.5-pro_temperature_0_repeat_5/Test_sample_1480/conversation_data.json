    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Core Task:** Calculate the \"rule activation level\".\n    *   **Fuzzy System Type:** Interval Type-3 Fuzzy Set (IT3 FS).\n    *   **Given Values:**\n        *   `Phi_k(x′) = 0.7`: This value represents the firing strength or membership degree of the first part of the antecedent (the \"IF\" part) of the k-th rule for a given input `x'`.\n        *   `μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9`: This value represents the membership degree of another part of the rule. Given the task is to find the overall activation level, this is most likely the second clause in the antecedent (e.g., \"IF part_1 IS A **AND** part_2 IS B\").\n    *   **Operation:** A t-norm operation is specified. A t-norm is a mathematical function used to model the logical \"AND\" in fuzzy logic.\n\n2.  **Interpret the Context (Interval Type-3 Fuzzy Set):**\n    *   An Interval Type-3 Fuzzy Set is a very advanced concept with multiple layers of uncertainty. In a full IT3 system, the membership grades would not be simple numbers like 0.7 and 0.9. They would be Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Sets.\n    *   The fact that we are given crisp scalar values (0.7, 0.9) strongly implies that the problem has been simplified. We are likely calculating the activation level for a specific *vertical slice* or a specific point within the complex IT3 structure, which reduces the calculation to a Type-1 level for this specific instance. We should therefore proceed with the numbers as given.\n\n3.  **Understand the \"Rule Activation Level\" and \"t-norm\":**\n    *   The activation level (or firing strength) of a fuzzy rule is determined by evaluating its antecedent (the \"IF\" part).\n    *   When the antecedent consists of multiple clauses connected by \"AND\", their individual membership values are combined using a t-norm.\n    *   There are several types of t-norms. The most common are:\n        *   **Minimum t-norm:** `T(a, b) = min(a, b)`\n        *   **Product t-norm:** `T(a, b) = a * b`\n    *   Since the specific t-norm is not mentioned in the question, the standard convention is to use the **minimum** t-norm, as it is the most widely used, especially in Mamdani-type fuzzy systems.\n\n4.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    *   The rule activation level is the result of applying the t-norm to the membership values of the antecedent clauses.\n    *   **Rule Activation Level = t-norm(Phi_k(x′), μG_k_j(y_j))**\n    *   Using the assumed minimum t-norm:\n    *   **Rule Activation Level = min(0.7, 0.9)**\n    *   Comparing the two values, 0.7 is the smaller one.\n    *   **Rule Activation Level = 0.7**\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Simplification of IT3 FS:** The main point of caution is not to be confused by the term \"Interval Type-3 Fuzzy Set\". The problem provides scalar values, effectively reducing a complex problem to a simple Type-1 fuzzy logic calculation.\n2.  **Ambiguity of Notation:** The notation `μG_k_j(y_j)` typically refers to the consequent (the \"THEN\" part) of a rule. However, to calculate a single \"rule activation level\" using both given values, it's necessary to interpret both as inputs to the antecedent's t-norm operation.\n3.  **Unspecified T-Norm:** The question does not specify which t-norm to use. The choice of t-norm (e.g., `min` vs. `product`) would change the result. The standard and most common assumption in such cases is the `min` operator.\n4.  **Focus on the Operation:** The key is to recognize that the problem is a direct application of a t-norm to two numbers, regardless of the complex terminology surrounding it.\n\n### Final Answer Calculation\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis and assuming the standard minimum t-norm:\n\n*   **Inputs:** 0.7 and 0.9\n*   **Operation:** t-norm (assumed to be `min`)\n*   **Calculation:** `min(0.7, 0.9)`\n*   **Result:** 0.7\n\n<<<0.7>>>"
