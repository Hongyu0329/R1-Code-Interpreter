    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Objects of Study\n\nThe question asks about the category $C$ of indecomposable finite-dimensional representations of the quantum group $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$, where $q$ is a primitive third root of unity (e.g., $q = e^{2\\pi i / 3}$). The key properties of $q$ are $q^3=1$ and $q \\neq 1$. The smallest positive integer $l$ such that $q^l=1$ is $l=3$.\n\nThe category of all finite-dimensional representations of $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$ at a root of unity is complex. It contains continuous families of non-isomorphic simple (and thus indecomposable) modules. For instance, there are families of simple modules parameterized by non-zero complex numbers. This makes the phrase \"what percentage\" ill-defined if we consider all possible indecomposable representations, as we would be comparing cardinalities of continuous, infinite sets.\n\nTherefore, to arrive at a definite numerical answer, we must assume the question refers to a specific, natural, and discrete class of representations within this larger category.\n\n### Step 2: Identifying a Natural Class of Representations\n\nThe most natural class of representations to consider are the \"standard\" highest-weight modules, denoted $V_d$ for $d \\ge 0$. These are the quantum analogues of the $(d+1)$-dimensional irreducible representations of the classical Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C}$. The module $V_d$ is generated by a highest-weight vector $v_0$ and has dimension $d+1$.\n\n### Step 3: Analyzing the Properties of Standard Modules ($V_d$)\n\nWe need to determine which of these standard modules $V_d$ are indecomposable and which are irreducible.\n\n*   **Indecomposability:** Each $V_d$ is a highest-weight module generated by a single vector $v_0$. Its highest-weight space is one-dimensional. If $V_d$ were decomposable, say $V_d = M_1 \\oplus M_2$, the highest-weight vector $v_0$ would have to lie in one of the summands (say $M_1$). But since the entire module $V_d$ is generated from $v_0$ by the action of the algebra, this would imply $M_1 = V_d$ and $M_2 = 0$. Thus, each $V_d$ is indecomposable. All the modules $V_d$ are objects in the category $C$.\n\n*   **Irreducibility:** A standard module $V_d$ is irreducible if and only if the quantum integer $[n]_q$ is non-zero for all $n=1, 2, \\dots, d+1$. The crucial condition simplifies to whether $[d+1]_q \\neq 0$. The quantum integer is defined as:\n    $$[n]_q = \\frac{q^n - q^{-n}}{q - q^{-1}}$$\n    For $q=e^{2\\pi i/3}$, we have $l=3$. The quantum integer $[n]_q$ is zero if and only if $n$ is a multiple of $l=3$.\n    Therefore, the module $V_d$ is irreducible if and only if $d+1$ is not a multiple of 3.\n\n### Step 4: Calculating the Percentage\n\nWe can now interpret the question \"What percentage...\" in two consistent ways:\n\n**Method 1: The \"First Period\" of Representations**\nThe representation theory of $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$ exhibits a periodic behavior with period $l=3$. It is natural to analyze the first block of representations, i.e., for $d=0, 1, \\dots, l-1$. For $l=3$, this is the set $\\{V_0, V_1, V_2\\}$.\n\n*   **$V_0$ (d=0):** The dimension is $0+1=1$. We check irreducibility with $d+1=1$. $[1]_q = 1 \\neq 0$. So, $V_0$ is **irreducible**.\n*   **$V_1$ (d=1):** The dimension is $1+1=2$. We check irreducibility with $d+1=2$. $[2]_q = q+q^{-1} = e^{2\\pi i/3} + e^{-2\\pi i/3} = 2\\cos(2\\pi/3) = -1 \\neq 0$. So, $V_1$ is **irreducible**.\n*   **$V_2$ (d=2):** The dimension is $2+1=3$. We check irreducibility with $d+1=3$. $[3]_q = \\frac{q^3-q^{-3}}{q-q^{-1}} = \\frac{1-1}{q-q^{-1}} = 0$. So, $V_2$ is **reducible**.\n\nWe have a set of 3 indecomposable modules $\\{V_0, V_1, V_2\\}$. Among these, 2 are irreducible ($V_0$ and $V_1$).\nThe percentage of irreducible modules in this set is $\\frac{2}{3} \\times 100\\% = 66.666...\\%$.\n\n**Method 2: Asymptotic Density**\nThis method considers the entire infinite sequence of standard modules $\\{V_d\\}_{d \\ge 0}$ and calculates the density of the irreducible ones.\n\n*   $V_d$ is irreducible if and only if $d+1$ is not a multiple of 3.\n*   $V_d$ is reducible (but still indecomposable) if and only if $d+1$ is a multiple of 3. This occurs for $d=2, 5, 8, 11, \\dots$.\n\nIn any sequence of 3 consecutive values for $d$, say $(k, k+1, k+2)$, the corresponding values for $d+1$ are $(k+1, k+2, k+3)$. Exactly one of these is a multiple of 3. Thus, for every three consecutive standard modules, one is reducible and two are irreducible.\nThe asymptotic density of irreducible modules in the set of all standard modules is $\\frac{2}{3}$.\nThe percentage is $\\frac{2}{3} \\times 100\\% = 66.666...\\%$.\n\nBoth reasonable interpretations yield the same result.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe total number of indecomposable standard representations we consider in the fundamental period is 3 ($V_0, V_1, V_2$).\nThe number of these that are irreducible is 2 ($V_0, V_1$).\nThe percentage is $\\frac{2}{3} \\times 100\\%$.\n\n$66.666...$\n\n<<<66.666667>>>"
