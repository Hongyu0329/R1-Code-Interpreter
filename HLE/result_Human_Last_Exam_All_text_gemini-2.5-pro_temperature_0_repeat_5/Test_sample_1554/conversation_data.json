    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Core Subject:** A specific philosophical concept.\n    *   **The Concept:** The decomposition of the notion of \"hallmark\" into \"symptoms\" and \"signals\".\n    *   **The Context:** The philosopher must belong to the \"Lviv-Warsaw School\".\n\n2.  **Identify the Lviv-Warsaw School:**\n    *   This was a highly influential school of logic and analytic philosophy in Poland during the interwar period (1918-1939).\n    *   Key figures include its founder Kazimierz Twardowski, and his students such as Jan Łukasiewicz, Stanisław Leśniewski, Alfred Tarski, Tadeusz Kotarbiński, and Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz.\n    *   The school was known for its emphasis on clarity, logical rigor, and the analysis of language and meaning.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Key Terms: \"Hallmark,\" \"Symptom,\" and \"Signal\":**\n    *   This terminology points towards the field of **semiotics** (the theory of signs) or **epistemology** (the theory of knowledge), specifically how we recognize things or gain knowledge from signs.\n    *   A **hallmark** is a general term for a distinguishing characteristic or sign.\n    *   A **symptom** suggests a natural, causal connection. For example, a fever is a symptom of an illness. Smoke is a symptom of fire. The connection is not arbitrary.\n    *   A **signal** suggests a conventional, rule-based, or intentional connection. For example, a red traffic light is a signal to stop. The word \"cat\" is a signal for the animal. The connection is established by agreement or convention.\n\n4.  **Connect the Concepts to a Philosopher from the School:**\n    *   We need to find which philosopher from the Lviv-Warsaw School worked on the theory of signs and made this specific distinction.\n    *   While many members worked on the philosophy of language, the philosopher most famously associated with this particular semiotic distinction is **Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz**.\n\n5.  **Verify Ajdukiewicz's Contribution:**\n    *   In his work on epistemology and the philosophy of language, Ajdukiewicz provided a detailed analysis of signs.\n    *   He distinguished between different kinds of signs, most notably between what he called *oznaka* (symptom or index) and *sygnał* (signal).\n    *   **Oznaka (Symptom):** A natural sign. The relationship between the sign and what it signifies is based on a natural, often causal, correlation. An observer infers the existence of one thing from the presence of another.\n    *   **Sygnał (Signal):** A conventional sign. The relationship is established by a set of rules or a convention. This category includes human language, traffic signs, and other symbolic systems created for communication.\n    *   This framework is a precise way to analyze the broader, more general notion of a \"hallmark\" or \"sign\" by breaking it down into its constituent types based on the nature of the relationship between the sign and the signified.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe philosopher from the Lviv-Warsaw School who analyzed the general concept of a sign or hallmark and decomposed it into the specific categories of \"symptoms\" (natural signs) and \"signals\" (conventional signs) is Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz.\n\n<<<Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz>>>"
