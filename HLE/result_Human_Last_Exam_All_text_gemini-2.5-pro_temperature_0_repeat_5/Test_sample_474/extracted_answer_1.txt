No, this approach is not valid. The core ecological function of mimicry syndromes in bees is to provide a warning signal to natural predators, such as birds. The validity of a mimicry ring is therefore dependent on the perception of these predators, not humans.

The primary flaw is using human undergraduates as the judges of similarity. Human vision is fundamentally different from that of many key predators. For instance, birds can perceive ultraviolet (UV) light, which is invisible to humans. Color patterns on bees often include UV signals, meaning two species that appear identical to a human might be easily distinguishable to a bird, and vice-versa. Therefore, clusters based on human perception may not reflect the functional mimicry rings that have evolved under predator selection pressure.

Furthermore, using "untrained" individuals introduces high subjectivity, and relying on static images ignores dynamic cues like flight patterns which can also be part of the warning signal. The study incorrectly equates human-perceived similarity with ecological function, making its methodology and any resulting conclusions invalid for understanding mimicry.
