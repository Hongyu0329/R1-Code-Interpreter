    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the first clue.**\nThe first clue mentions the poet Andrei Voznesensky and a quote describing a man as \"a joy-discovering sailor.\" This points to a famous work by Voznesensky about a historical figure associated with the sea. Voznesensky's most famous work fitting this description is the rock opera \"Juno and Avos\" (Юнона и Авось), which is about a real historical expedition.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the second clue.**\nThe second clue is a direct question from Voznesensky's work: \"Where is your grave, even a mound?\" This line is from the epilogue of \"Juno and Avos.\" It highlights that the burial place of the opera's protagonist was unknown for a very long time. The protagonist of \"Juno and Avos\" is the Russian diplomat and explorer Nikolai Rezanov.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the third clue.**\nThe third clue states that the answer to the question about the grave \"emerged in the late 1980s.\" This provides a specific timeframe for the rediscovery of the grave. Nikolai Rezanov died in Krasnoyarsk in 1807 and was buried in the Voskresensky Cathedral. The cathedral was demolished in the 1930s by the Soviet government, and the exact location of his grave was lost. Fueled by the immense popularity of the rock opera, a movement to find and honor Rezanov's resting place gained momentum. In the late 1980s, the presumed site of his grave was located, and in 1989, a monument was erected there. This event perfectly matches the clue.\n\n**Step 4: Synthesize the information.**\nAll three clues point to the same historical figure:\n*   He was the subject of Voznesensky's famous work about a sailor/explorer (\"Juno and Avos\").\n*   His grave was lost, a fact lamented in the work itself.\n*   His presumed grave site was rediscovered and memorialized in the late 1980s.\n\nThis man is Nikolai Petrovich Rezanov. The question asks for his last name.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n*   The phrase \"joy-discovering sailor\" is a poetic characterization, not necessarily a literal title. It captures the spirit of Rezanov's portrayal in the opera as a visionary and romantic figure.\n*   The \"answer\" emerging in the late 1980s refers to the public rediscovery and memorialization of the grave site, not necessarily the exhumation and positive identification of the remains.\n*   The connection between all three clues (Voznesensky, the lost grave, and the 1980s discovery) is crucial and uniquely identifies the person in question.\n\n**Final Answer Derivation:**\nThe man described is Nikolai Rezanov, the protagonist of Voznesensky's \"Juno and Avos.\" His last name is Rezanov.\n\n<<<Rezanov>>>"
