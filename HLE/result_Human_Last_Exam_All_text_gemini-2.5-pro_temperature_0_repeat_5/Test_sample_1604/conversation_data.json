    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the latest historical battle depicted in a painting by Lady Butler.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Question:** The goal is to find the battle, among all those painted by Elizabeth Thompson, Lady Butler, that occurred most recently in history. This requires distinguishing between the date a painting was created and the date of the historical event it portrays.\n\n2.  **Compile a List of Lady Butler's Battle Paintings:** We need to list her significant works that depict specific battles or military actions.\n\n3.  **Determine the Historical Date of Each Depicted Event:** For each painting, we must research the date of the battle or campaign shown.\n\n4.  **Compare the Dates:** Finally, we will compare the dates of all the historical events to identify the latest one.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Painting Date vs. Event Date:** The question is about the *historical* event, not when the painting was made. For example, *Scotland Forever!* was painted in 1881, but it depicts the Battle of Waterloo from 1815.\n*   **Completeness of the List:** It is important to consider Lady Butler's entire career, including her later works, as these are more likely to depict more recent conflicts.\n*   **Specificity of the Event:** Some paintings depict a specific action within a larger war. The date of that specific action is the relevant one.\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer\n\nLet's apply the steps to a list of Lady Butler's notable battle paintings:\n\n*   ***The 28th Regiment at Quatre Bras*** (painted 1875)\n    *   **Depicted Event:** The Battle of Quatre Bras.\n    *   **Historical Date:** June 16, 1815.\n\n*   ***Scotland Forever!*** (painted 1881)\n    *   **Depicted Event:** The charge of the Royal Scots Greys at the Battle of Waterloo.\n    *   **Historical Date:** June 18, 1815.\n\n*   ***The Remnants of an Army*** (painted 1879)\n    *   **Depicted Event:** The arrival of William Brydon, the sole survivor of a 4,500-man column, at Jalalabad during the 1842 retreat from Kabul.\n    *   **Historical Date:** January 1842.\n\n*   ***The Roll Call*** (painted 1874)\n    *   **Depicted Event:** An aftermath scene from the Battle of Inkerman during the Crimean War.\n    *   **Historical Date:** November 5, 1854.\n\n*   ***The Defence of Rorke's Drift*** (painted 1880)\n    *   **Depicted Event:** The Battle of Rorke's Drift during the Anglo-Zulu War.\n    *   **Historical Date:** January 22–23, 1879.\n\n*   ***Floreat Etona!*** (painted 1882)\n    *   **Depicted Event:** An incident involving Lieutenant Robert Elwes at the Battle of Laing's Nek during the First Boer War.\n    *   **Historical Date:** January 28, 1881.\n\n*   ***The Camel Corps*** (painted 1886)\n    *   **Depicted Event:** The Gordon Relief Expedition during the Mahdist War.\n    *   **Historical Date:** 1884–1885.\n\n*   ***A Detachment of the D.C.L.I. in Action in South Africa*** (painted 1905)\n    *   **Depicted Event:** An action during the Second Boer War.\n    *   **Historical Date:** 1899–1902.\n\n*   ***The Charge of the Dorset Yeomanry at Agagia, 26th February 1916*** (painted 1917)\n    *   **Depicted Event:** The Battle of Agagia, part of the Senussi Campaign during the First World War.\n    *   **Historical Date:** February 26, 1916.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nComparing the historical dates of the events:\n*   1815 (Quatre Bras, Waterloo)\n*   1842 (Retreat from Kabul)\n*   1854 (Inkerman)\n*   1879 (Rorke's Drift)\n*   1881 (Laing's Nek)\n*   1884-1885 (Gordon Relief Expedition)\n*   1899-1902 (Second Boer War)\n*   **1916** (Battle of Agagia)\n\nThe latest historical event is the Battle of Agagia, which occurred in 1916.\n\n<<<The Battle of Agagia>>>"
