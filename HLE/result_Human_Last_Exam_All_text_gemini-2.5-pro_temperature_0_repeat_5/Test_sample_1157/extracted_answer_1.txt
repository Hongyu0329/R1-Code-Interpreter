**1. Management Procedures:** The appropriate management involves a multi-phase approach.
    *   **Phase 1 (Emergency):** Immediate referral to a physician to start treatment for the uncontrolled diabetes. Dental emergency care includes wound irrigation of the sockets, suturing of soft tissues, prescription of systemic antibiotics and analgesics, and administration of a tetanus booster.
    *   **Phase 2 (Healing):** A healing period of 3-6 months is required to allow for tissue maturation and bone remodeling, during which the patient's diabetes must be brought under control (target HbA1c < 7%). A full periodontal evaluation and treatment of the remaining teeth must also be completed.
    *   **Phase 3 (Definitive):** The most appropriate prosthetic replacement is a removable partial denture, planned after her medical and periodontal conditions are stable.

**2. Cells of Interest:** The cells of interest are those critical to wound healing and the immune response, whose functions are impaired by hyperglycemia. These include **Neutrophils, Macrophages, Fibroblasts, Osteoblasts, and Osteoclasts.**

**3. Denture Replacement Details:**
    *   **Denture Type and Material:** A **Cast Metal Framework Removable Partial Denture** made from a **Cobalt-Chromium alloy** with acrylic resin teeth and base.
    *   **Abutment Teeth:** The primary abutment teeth will be the **left central incisor** and the **left second premolar**.
    *   **Reasons:** These teeth are chosen for their **proximity** to the edentulous space, allowing them to provide optimal **support** (via rests), **retention** (via clasps), and **stability** for the denture. This is conditional on them being periodontally and structurally sound.
