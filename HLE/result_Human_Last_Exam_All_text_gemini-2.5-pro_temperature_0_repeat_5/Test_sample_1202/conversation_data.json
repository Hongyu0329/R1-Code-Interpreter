    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question and answer choices.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Question**\n\nThe question asks for the mechanism that is \"most likely responsible for the retention and divergence of duplicate genes in eukaryotic genomes.\" Let's break this down:\n*   **Gene Duplication:** A process that creates a second copy of a gene. Initially, this second copy is redundant.\n*   **Retention:** The process by which this second copy avoids being lost. The most common fate of a redundant gene is to accumulate disabling mutations and become a non-functional pseudogene. For retention to occur, there must be some selective pressure to keep both copies.\n*   **Divergence:** The process by which the two gene copies accumulate mutations over time, causing their DNA sequences (and potentially their functions) to become different from each other.\n*   **Most Likely:** This qualifier suggests we should choose the mechanism that is considered the most common or probable pathway for retention.\n\n**2. Analyze the Answer Choices**\n\n*   **A. Gene conversion:** This is a mechanism where one DNA sequence replaces another homologous sequence, making them identical. This process causes *homogenization*, which is the opposite of divergence. While it occurs between duplicate genes, it works against their long-term retention as two distinct entities. Therefore, it is not the correct answer.\n\n*   **B. Pseudogenization:** This is the process where one of the duplicate genes accumulates mutations that render it non-functional. This is a mechanism of gene *loss*, not *retention* of a functional gene pair. It is the most common fate of duplicate genes, but it doesn't explain how both copies are kept.\n\n*   **C. Neofunctionalization:** This model proposes that after duplication, one copy maintains the original ancestral function, while the other copy is free to accumulate mutations. By chance, one of these mutations may result in a new, beneficial function. Natural selection would then preserve both copiesâ€”one for the original function and one for the new one. This model successfully explains both retention and divergence. However, it relies on the occurrence of a rare beneficial, gain-of-function mutation.\n\n*   **D. Subfunctionalization:** This model (also known as the Duplication-Degeneration-Complementation or DDC model) proposes that the ancestral gene had multiple functions or complex regulatory elements (e.g., it was expressed in different tissues or at different times). After duplication, each copy can accumulate degenerative mutations that disable *different* subfunctions. For example, copy 1 might lose function A but retain function B, while copy 2 loses function B but retains function A. Now, both copies are required to perform the full range of the original gene's functions. This model also explains both retention and divergence.\n\n*   **E. Adaptive radiation:** This is a large-scale evolutionary process where a single lineage rapidly diversifies into many new species to fill available ecological niches. While gene duplication can provide the raw genetic material that fuels adaptive radiation, it is not the specific molecular mechanism that explains how an individual pair of duplicate genes is retained and diverges within a genome. It describes a pattern at the species level, not the gene level.\n\n**3. Compare the Strongest Candidates (C and D)**\n\nBoth neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization are valid and important mechanisms for the retention of duplicate genes. The question asks which is \"most likely.\"\n\n*   **Likelihood of Mutations:** Subfunctionalization relies on the accumulation of relatively common *loss-of-function* mutations in different parts of the two gene copies. Neofunctionalization, in contrast, requires a much rarer *gain-of-function* mutation that creates a new, beneficial role.\n*   **Probability of Retention:** Because degenerative mutations are far more common than beneficial, novel-function mutations, the subfunctionalization pathway is considered a more frequent and probable mechanism for the *initial* preservation of duplicate genes. It provides a passive route to retention that doesn't require a rare, lucky event. Once preserved by subfunctionalization, a gene pair might later undergo neofunctionalization, but subfunctionalization is a more likely initial step.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nGiven that subfunctionalization relies on more common mutational events (degeneration) compared to neofunctionalization (novel gain-of-function), it is considered the more likely and widespread mechanism for the initial retention and subsequent divergence of duplicate genes.\n\n<<<D>>>"
