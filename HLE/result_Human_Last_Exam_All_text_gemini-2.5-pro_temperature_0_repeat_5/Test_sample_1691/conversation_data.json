    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to derive the analytical formula for the integral $I(\\epsilon)$ in the small $\\epsilon$ regime.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the integral and the integrand**\n\nThe integral is given by:\n$I(\\epsilon) = \\int_0^{15.00} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9.0 x^{5.0} + 5.0 x^{6.0} + 9.0 x^{8.0}} dx$\n\nLet the denominator be $D(x, \\epsilon) = \\epsilon + g(x)$, where $g(x) = 9x^5 + 5x^6 + 9x^8$.\nWe are interested in the behavior of $I(\\epsilon)$ for small positive $\\epsilon$ (i.e., $\\epsilon \\to 0^+$).\n\nFirst, we examine the function $g(x)$ in the integration interval $[0, 15]$.\n$g(x) = x^5(9 + 5x + 9x^3)$.\nFor $x \\in (0, 15]$, $g(x)$ is strictly positive.\nAt $x=0$, we have $g(0) = 0$.\n\nAs $\\epsilon \\to 0^+$, the term $\\epsilon$ in the denominator becomes very small. The denominator $D(x, \\epsilon)$ approaches $g(x)$. Since $g(0)=0$, the integrand $\\frac{1}{D(x, \\epsilon)}$ becomes very large near $x=0$. This indicates that the dominant contribution to the integral comes from the region near $x=0$. This is a classic singular perturbation problem.\n\n**Step 2: Approximate the integrand in the dominant region**\n\nSince the behavior of the integral is dominated by the region near $x=0$, we can approximate $g(x)$ by its behavior for small $x$. For $x \\to 0$, the lowest power of $x$ dominates.\n$g(x) = 9x^5 + 5x^6 + 9x^8 \\approx 9x^5$.\n\nWe can therefore approximate the integral by replacing $g(x)$ with its leading term:\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\int_0^{15} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9x^5} dx$.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the approximate integral using scaling**\n\nThe integral is still not straightforward to evaluate. We can simplify it by a change of variables that captures the essential scaling of the problem. The \"inner region\" or \"boundary layer\" is where the two terms in the denominator are of the same order, i.e., $\\epsilon \\approx 9x^5$. This suggests the scaling $x \\sim (\\epsilon/9)^{1/5}$.\n\nLet's introduce a dimensionless variable $y$ such that:\n$x = \\left(\\frac{\\epsilon}{9}\\right)^{1/5} y$\nThen, $dx = \\left(\\frac{\\epsilon}{9}\\right)^{1/5} dy$.\n\nNow, we change the variable of integration from $x$ to $y$:\nThe lower limit remains $x=0 \\implies y=0$.\nThe upper limit becomes $x=15 \\implies y = 15 / (\\epsilon/9)^{1/5} = 15 \\cdot (9/\\epsilon)^{1/5}$.\nAs $\\epsilon \\to 0^+$, the upper limit for $y$ tends to infinity.\n\nSubstituting into the approximate integral:\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\int_0^{15(9/\\epsilon)^{1/5}} \\frac{\\left(\\frac{\\epsilon}{9}\\right)^{1/5} dy}{\\epsilon + 9 \\left( \\left(\\frac{\\epsilon}{9}\\right)^{1/5} y \\right)^5} = \\int_0^{15(9/\\epsilon)^{1/5}} \\frac{(\\epsilon/9)^{1/5} dy}{\\epsilon + 9 \\left(\\frac{\\epsilon}{9}\\right) y^5}$\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\int_0^{15(9/\\epsilon)^{1/5}} \\frac{(\\epsilon/9)^{1/5} dy}{\\epsilon(1 + y^5)} = \\frac{1}{\\epsilon} \\left(\\frac{\\epsilon}{9}\\right)^{1/5} \\int_0^{15(9/\\epsilon)^{1/5}} \\frac{1}{1+y^5} dy$\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx 9^{-1/5} \\epsilon^{1/5 - 1} \\int_0^{15(9/\\epsilon)^{1/5}} \\frac{1}{1+y^5} dy = 9^{-1/5} \\epsilon^{-4/5} \\int_0^{15(9/\\epsilon)^{1/5}} \\frac{1}{1+y^5} dy$\n\n**Step 4: Finalize the approximation**\n\nSince the upper limit of the integral $15(9/\\epsilon)^{1/5} \\to \\infty$ as $\\epsilon \\to 0$, we can replace the integral with a definite integral from $0$ to $\\infty$. The error introduced by this approximation is of a lower order in $\\epsilon$ than the leading term we are calculating.\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx 9^{-1/5} \\epsilon^{-4/5} \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{1+y^5} dy$.\n\nThe integral $\\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{1+y^n} dy$ is a standard result given by $\\frac{\\pi/n}{\\sin(\\pi/n)}$.\nFor our case, $n=5.0$. So, the value of the integral is $\\frac{\\pi/5}{\\sin(\\pi/5)}$.\n\nSubstituting this result back into our expression for $I(\\epsilon)$:\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx 9^{-1/5} \\epsilon^{-4/5} \\left( \\frac{\\pi/5}{\\sin(\\pi/5)} \\right)$.\n\nThis can be written in a more organized way:\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\frac{\\pi}{5 \\cdot 9^{1/5} \\sin(\\pi/5)} \\epsilon^{-4/5}$.\n\nThe problem statement uses floating-point numbers (e.g., 5.0, 9.0), so it is appropriate to express the exponents as decimals:\n$1/5 = 0.2$\n$-4/5 = -0.8$\n\nThe final analytical formula is:\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\frac{\\pi}{5 \\cdot (9.0)^{0.2} \\sin(\\pi/5)} \\epsilon^{-0.8}$.\n\nThis formula describes the leading-order asymptotic behavior of the integral for small $\\epsilon$.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n1.  **Identifying the singularity:** The key is to recognize that the integral's behavior for small $\\epsilon$ is dominated by the point $x=0$ where the non-epsilon part of the denominator vanishes.\n2.  **Local Approximation (Dominant Balance):** Near the singularity, only the lowest power of $x$ in $g(x)$ is important. Higher-order terms ($5x^6, 9x^8$) are negligible in this region compared to the leading term ($9x^5$).\n3.  **Extending Integration Limits:** The change of variables transforms the fixed integration interval $[0, 15]$ into a variable interval $[0, 15(9/\\epsilon)^{1/5}]$. As $\\epsilon \\to 0$, this interval expands to cover $[0, \\infty)$. The contribution from the tail end is small, justifying the replacement of the upper limit with $\\infty$. This is a standard technique in asymptotic analysis.\n4.  **Standard Integral Formula:** Knowledge of the standard integral $\\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{1+y^n} dy$ is crucial for obtaining the final closed-form expression for the coefficient. This integral is related to the Gamma or Beta function, specifically $B(1/n, 1-1/n)$.\n\nThe derived formula is the leading term in the asymptotic expansion of $I(\\epsilon)$ and provides a very good approximation for sufficiently small $\\epsilon$.\n\n<<<I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\frac{\\pi}{5 \\cdot 9^{1/5} \\sin(\\pi/5)} \\epsilon^{-4/5}>>>"
