    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Key Concepts:**\n    *   **All-or-Nothing Vaccine:** This type of vaccine confers complete immunity to a certain fraction of the vaccinated individuals, while providing no protection at all to the remaining fraction.\n    *   **Per-Exposure Vaccine Efficacy (VE):** This is the proportional reduction in the risk of infection from a single exposure to an infectious source. For an all-or-nothing vaccine, this value represents the fraction of the vaccinated population that becomes completely immune. Let's denote the true vaccine efficacy as `VE_true`.\n    *   **Incidence Rate (λ):** This is the rate at which new cases of a disease occur in a population over a given period of person-time.\n    *   **Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR):** This is the ratio of the incidence rate in the vaccinated group (`λ_v`) to the incidence rate in the unvaccinated group (`λ_u`). `IRR = λ_v / λ_u`.\n    *   **Estimated Vaccine Efficacy:** The standard formula to calculate vaccine efficacy from an incidence rate ratio is `VE_estimated = 1 - IRR`.\n\n2.  **Model the Populations:**\n    *   **Unvaccinated Population:** The incidence rate in this group is `λ_u`. This rate represents the underlying force of infection in the community.\n    *   **Vaccinated Population:** This population is a mixture of two subgroups based on the all-or-nothing model:\n        *   A fraction `VE_true` is fully protected. Their risk of infection is zero, so their incidence rate is 0.\n        *   The remaining fraction, `1 - VE_true`, is completely unprotected. Their risk of infection is the same as the unvaccinated population, so their incidence rate is `λ_u`.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Overall Incidence Rate in the Vaccinated Group (`λ_v`):**\n    The overall incidence rate for the entire vaccinated group is the weighted average of the rates of its subgroups.\n    `λ_v = (Fraction Protected * Rate for Protected) + (Fraction Unprotected * Rate for Unprotected)`\n    `λ_v = (VE_true * 0) + ((1 - VE_true) * λ_u)`\n    `λ_v = (1 - VE_true) * λ_u`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR):**\n    Now, we can calculate the IRR using the incidence rates for the vaccinated and unvaccinated groups.\n    `IRR = λ_v / λ_u`\n    Substitute the expression for `λ_v` from the previous step:\n    `IRR = ((1 - VE_true) * λ_u) / λ_u`\n    The `λ_u` term cancels out from the numerator and the denominator:\n    `IRR = 1 - VE_true`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Estimated Vaccine Efficacy (`VE_estimated`):**\n    We use the standard formula `1 - IRR` to estimate the vaccine efficacy.\n    `VE_estimated = 1 - IRR`\n    Substitute the expression for `IRR` that we just derived:\n    `VE_estimated = 1 - (1 - VE_true)`\n    Simplify the expression:\n    `VE_estimated = 1 - 1 + VE_true`\n    `VE_estimated = VE_true`\n\n6.  **Compare the Estimate to the True Value:**\n    The result of our calculation shows that the vaccine efficacy estimated using the `1 - IRR` formula (`VE_estimated`) is exactly equal to the true per-exposure vaccine efficacy (`VE_true`) of the all-or-nothing vaccine.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Model Assumption:** This analysis relies on the \"all-or-nothing\" model of vaccine action. The conclusion would be the same for a \"leaky\" (or partial efficacy) vaccine, but the biological interpretation is different.\n*   **Constant Hazard:** The analysis assumes that the force of infection (hazard rate) is constant over the study period and is the same for both the unvaccinated group and the non-protected individuals in the vaccinated group.\n*   **No Confounding:** It is assumed that there are no other differences (like behavior, age, or underlying health conditions) between the vaccinated and unvaccinated groups that would affect their risk of infection. In a real-world study, these factors would need to be controlled for.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the formula `1 - incidence rate ratio` **correctly estimates** the per-exposure vaccine efficacy for an all-or-nothing vaccine.\n\n<<<C>>>"
