    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the identity of \"X-Y\".\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Key Figure and Context:** The question centers on Pavel Milyukov, a prominent Russian historian and liberal politician who was a leader of the Constitutional Democratic Party (the Kadets). The context is his criticism of Western culture, specifically his denunciation of something called \"X-Y\" as a \"stagnant swamp.\"\n\n2.  **Analyze Milyukov's Stance on Culture:** While Milyukov was a political \"Westernizer\" who advocated for Russia to adopt a Western-style constitutional democracy, his views on art and culture were notably conservative. He was a staunch defender of 19th-century realism and was highly critical of the new, experimental art movements emerging at the turn of the 20th century.\n\n3.  **Connect the Criticism to Specific Events:** Milyukov's most famous public denunciation of modern art occurred in a speech he gave to the Russian State Duma on March 1, 1913. In this speech, he attacked the Ministry of the Imperial Court for its decision to purchase paintings by contemporary avant-garde artists for a state museum.\n\n4.  **Identify the Target of the \"Stagnant Swamp\" Insult:** The specific group of artists Milyukov was targeting in his speech was the **\"Jack of Diamonds\"** (in Russian: *Бубновый валет*, *Bubnovy Valet*). This was a group of Russian avant-garde artists who held a famous exhibition in 1910 and were heavily influenced by Western European movements like French Post-Impressionism, Fauvism, and Cubism. Milyukov saw their work not as innovative but as a form of \"artistic hooliganism\" and referred to it as a \"stagnant swamp.\"\n\n5.  **Match the Target to the \"X-Y\" Placeholder:** The name of the art group, \"Jack of Diamonds,\" is a two-word phrase that perfectly fits the \"X-Y\" structure provided in the question. His criticism of this Russian group was, in effect, a criticism of the broader modernist trends emanating from Western Europe, which he saw as decadent.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Political vs. Cultural Views:** It is crucial to distinguish between Milyukov's political alignment (pro-Western) and his cultural tastes (conservative and traditionalist). This apparent contradiction is central to understanding the quote.\n*   **Russian Group, Western Influence:** The \"Jack of Diamonds\" was a Russian art group, but their style was deeply intertwined with the international avant-garde movement centered in Paris. Therefore, Milyukov's attack on them was an attack on what he perceived as a corrupting Western cultural influence.\n*   **The Specificity of the Quote:** The phrase \"stagnant swamp\" is a direct and well-documented part of Milyukov's critique of this specific art movement, confirming the connection.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBy analyzing Pavel Milyukov's known cultural views and pinpointing the specific historical event where he used the phrase \"stagnant swamp,\" we can confidently identify the target of his criticism. The \"X-Y\" in the question refers to the Russian avant-garde art group that was heavily influenced by Western modernism.\n\n<<<Jack of Diamonds>>>"
