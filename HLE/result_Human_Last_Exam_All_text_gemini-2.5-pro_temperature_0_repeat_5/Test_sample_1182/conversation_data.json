    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of double points on the stable reduction of the curve $y^2=8x+x^2+4x^3+4x^4+8x^5$ above 2.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the curve and the problem.**\nThe curve is a hyperelliptic curve $C$ given by the equation $y^2 = f(x)$, where $f(x) = 8x^5 + 4x^4 + 4x^3 + x^2 + 8x$.\nThe genus of this curve is $g = \\lfloor (\\deg(f)-1)/2 \\rfloor = \\lfloor (5-1)/2 \\rfloor = 2$.\nWe need to find the number of double points (nodes) on its stable reduction over the 2-adic integers $\\mathbb{Z}_2$. The stable reduction is a specific type of model for the curve whose special fiber (the reduction modulo 2) consists of a connected curve with only ordinary double points as singularities. The arithmetic genus of the stable reduction must be equal to the genus of the original curve, which is 2.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the branch points of the curve.**\nThe branch points of the hyperelliptic curve are the roots of the polynomial $f(x)$ and the point at infinity, as the degree of $f(x)$ is odd. Let the set of branch points be $B$.\nThe polynomial is $f(x) = x(8x^4 + 4x^4 + 4x^3 + x + 8)$. One root is $\\alpha_0 = 0$.\nTo find the 2-adic valuations of the other roots, we use the Newton polygon for the polynomial $g(x) = 8x^4 + 4x^3 + 4x^2 + x + 8$. The vertices of the Newton polygon are given by the points $(i, v_2(a_i))$, where $a_i$ are the coefficients of $g(x)$.\nThe points are $(0, v_2(8))=(0,3)$, $(1, v_2(1))=(1,0)$, $(2, v_2(4))=(2,2)$, $(3, v_2(4))=(3,2)$, $(4, v_2(8))=(4,3)$.\nThe lower convex hull of these points consists of two segments:\n1.  From $(0,3)$ to $(1,0)$: The slope is $(0-3)/(1-0) = -3$. The horizontal length is 1. This corresponds to one root, let's call it $\\alpha_1$, with valuation $v_2(\\alpha_1) = -(-3) = 3$.\n2.  From $(1,0)$ to $(4,3)$: The slope is $(3-0)/(4-1) = 1$. The horizontal length is 3. This corresponds to three roots, $\\alpha_2, \\alpha_3, \\alpha_4$, each with valuation $v_2(\\alpha_i) = -(1) = -1$.\n\nSo, the finite branch points are $\\alpha_0=0$, $\\alpha_1$ with $v_2(\\alpha_1)=3$, and $\\alpha_2, \\alpha_3, \\alpha_4$ with $v_2(\\alpha_i)=-1$. The last branch point is $\\alpha_5 = \\infty$.\n\n**Step 3: Cluster the branch points.**\nWe group the branch points based on their reduction modulo 2.\n*   $\\alpha_0 = 0$ reduces to $0 \\pmod 2$.\n*   $v_2(\\alpha_1) = 3 > 0$, so $\\alpha_1$ is in $2\\mathbb{Z}_2$ and reduces to $0 \\pmod 2$.\n*   $v_2(\\alpha_i) = -1 < 0$ for $i=2,3,4$. These points are not in $\\mathbb{Z}_2$. In the projective line $\\mathbb{P}^1(\\mathbb{Q}_2)$, they reduce to the point at infinity.\n*   $\\alpha_5 = \\infty$ also corresponds to the point at infinity.\n\nThis gives us two clusters of branch points:\n*   Cluster $S_0 = \\{\\alpha_0, \\alpha_1\\} = \\{0, \\alpha_1\\}$, which reduces to $0 \\in \\mathbb{P}^1(\\mathbb{F}_2)$. This cluster has size $\\#S_0 = 2$.\n*   Cluster $S_\\infty = \\{\\alpha_2, \\alpha_3, \\alpha_4, \\infty\\}$, which reduces to $\\infty \\in \\mathbb{P}^1(\\mathbb{F}_2)$. This cluster has size $\\#S_\\infty = 4$.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the structure of the stable reduction.**\nThe structure of the stable reduction is determined by this clustering. When the branch points partition into clusters, the stable reduction is typically formed by components corresponding to these clusters.\nThe theory of stable reduction for hyperelliptic curves indicates that if the branch points partition into two sets $B_1$ and $B_2$ of even size, the stable reduction consists of two components, $C_1$ and $C_2$.\n*   The genus of component $C_1$ is $g_1 = (\\#B_1/2) - 1$.\n*   The genus of component $C_2$ is $g_2 = (\\#B_2/2) - 1$.\n*   These two components intersect in two points, creating two nodes.\n\nIn our case, we have $B_1 = S_0$ and $B_2 = S_\\infty$.\n*   $\\#B_1 = 2$, which is even. The corresponding component $C_1$ has genus $g_1 = (2/2) - 1 = 0$.\n*   $\\#B_2 = 4$, which is even. The corresponding component $C_2$ has genus $g_2 = (4/2) - 1 = 1$.\n\nSo, the stable reduction consists of a genus 0 curve (a rational curve, $\\mathbb{P}^1$) and a genus 1 curve (an elliptic curve) intersecting at two points.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the number of double points.**\nThe double points (nodes) of the stable reduction are the points where its components intersect. In the configuration determined in Step 4, the two components intersect at two distinct points. Therefore, the stable reduction has 2 double points.\n\n**Step 6: Verify the arithmetic genus.**\nThe arithmetic genus of the stable reduction must equal the genus of the original curve ($g=2$). Let's verify this for our proposed model.\nThe formula for the arithmetic genus of a reducible curve is $p_a = \\sum g_i + \\delta - N + 1$, where:\n*   $g_i$ are the genera of the components.\n*   $\\delta$ is the number of double points (nodes).\n*   $N$ is the number of components.\n\nIn our case:\n*   $g_1 = 0$, $g_2 = 1$.\n*   $\\delta = 2$.\n*   $N = 2$.\n\n$p_a = (g_1 + g_2) + \\delta - N + 1 = (0 + 1) + 2 - 2 + 1 = 2$.\nThis matches the genus of the original curve, which gives us confidence in this model of the stable reduction.\n\nThe number of double points in the stable reduction is the number of nodes, which is $\\delta$.\n\nFinal Answer: The stable reduction has 2 double points."
