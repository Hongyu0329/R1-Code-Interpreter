    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the correct Beyond-Use Date (BUD).\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\n*   **Item:** Single-dose container ampule.\n*   **Action:** Punctured (or opened, in the case of an ampule).\n*   **Environment:** Sterile environment.\n*   **Goal:** Determine the Beyond-Use Date (BUD).\n\n**Step 2: Define Key Terms**\n*   **Single-Dose Container/Ampule:** This is a container holding a sterile medication intended for a single use in one patient. A critical characteristic is that it **lacks an antimicrobial preservative**. An ampule is a sealed glass container that is broken open and cannot be resealed.\n*   **Beyond-Use Date (BUD):** This is the date or time after which a compounded sterile preparation (CSP) or, in this case, a punctured container, must not be used. It is determined based on the risk of microbial contamination.\n*   **Sterile Environment:** In the context of pharmaceutical compounding, this refers to an ISO Class 5 Primary Engineering Control (PEC), such as a laminar airflow workbench (LAFW) or a biological safety cabinet (BSC).\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Governing Standard**\nThe standards for sterile compounding and the assignment of BUDs are set by the **United States Pharmacopeia (USP) General Chapter <797> \"Pharmaceutical Compoundingâ€”Sterile Preparations\"**. We must refer to the rules outlined in this chapter.\n\n**Step 4: Apply the Specific USP <797> Rule**\nAccording to the current USP <797> guidelines (the 2022 version, official as of November 1, 2023), the rule for single-dose containers is as follows:\n*   When a single-dose container (such as an ampule or a vial) is opened or punctured **inside an ISO Class 5 PEC**, the contents may be used for up to **12 hours** after the initial entry.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Environment is Crucial:** The 12-hour BUD is **only** applicable when the ampule is opened and maintained within the sterile, controlled environment of an ISO Class 5 PEC. If the same ampule were opened outside of a PEC (e.g., at a patient's bedside), the BUD would be only **1 hour**.\n2.  **Ampule vs. Vial Practicality:** While the USP <797> rule applies to all single-dose containers, there is a practical difference. A vial has a rubber stopper that reseals after being punctured. An ampule, once broken, is an open container. Even in the sterile air of a PEC, leaving an ampule open for an extended period increases the risk of contamination. Therefore, best practice is to withdraw the necessary contents from an ampule immediately after opening and then discard the ampule and any remaining contents. The 12-hour rule is more practically applied to re-entering a single-dose *vial* within the PEC.\n3.  **Source Container vs. Final Product:** This 12-hour BUD applies to the source container (the ampule) itself. If the contents of the ampule are used to make a Compounded Sterile Preparation (CSP), that final product (e.g., an IV bag or a syringe) will have its own, separate BUD based on its ingredients, risk level, and storage conditions.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nBased on the specific rule in USP <797> for a single-dose container opened in an ISO Class 5 environment, the maximum allowable time for use is 12 hours.\n\n<<<12 hours>>>"
