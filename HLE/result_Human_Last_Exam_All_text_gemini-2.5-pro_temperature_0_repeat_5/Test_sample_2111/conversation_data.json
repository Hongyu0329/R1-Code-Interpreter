    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe question asks to identify a specific \"conceptual entity.\" We are given several clues about this entity:\n*   It was discussed by the historian Fernand Braudel.\n*   Braudel was quoting another writer, Paul Morand.\n*   The entity is described as something that \"should be inscribed within a sphere.\"\n*   The \"symbol of a nation\" is given as an example or symbol of this entity.\n\n**Step 2: Locate the Source of the Quote**\nThe reference to Fernand Braudel, a global perspective, and the specific phrasing points towards his major work, *Civilization and Capitalism, 15th-18th Century*. The quote in question appears in the foreword to the third volume, *The Perspective of the World*.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Original Quote and its Context**\nIn the foreword, Braudel discusses the concept of the \"world-economy\" (*Ã©conomie-monde*) and the need to define its spatial boundaries. He first cites Paul Morand:\n*   **Morand's assertion:** \"Paul Morand was right to say that 'for a nation, as for a man, to be is to be within bounds'.\"\nThis sets up the idea of defined limits, using the nation as the subject.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze Braudel's Extension of the Idea**\nBraudel then explicitly states that he wants to take this idea further and apply it to a broader concept. He writes:\n*   **Braudel's extension:** \"I would go further and say that **a civilization**, symbolized by a nation, should be inscribed within a sphere, or rather a series of concentric spheres, which would have to be drawn on a map.\"\n\n**Step 5: Identify the Conceptual Entity**\nBy directly examining Braudel's text, we can pinpoint the entity he is referring to.\n*   The question asks for the \"conceptual entity.\"\n*   Braudel's text says, \"...**a civilization**, symbolized by a nation, should be inscribed within a sphere...\"\n*   Therefore, the conceptual entity that is symbolized by a nation and should be inscribed within a sphere is **civilization**.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n*   It is crucial to distinguish between what Morand said and what Braudel said. Morand's quote is about the \"nation.\" Braudel uses that as a springboard to talk about the larger entity.\n*   The nation is not the entity itself, but a *symbol* of it, according to Braudel's formulation.\n*   The \"sphere\" is a metaphor used by Braudel to describe the spatial and influential boundaries of this entity.\n\n**Conclusion**\nBased on the direct quote from Fernand Braudel's *The Perspective of the World*, the conceptual entity he argues should be inscribed within a sphere, and which is symbolized by a nation, is a civilization.\n\n<<<Civilization>>>"
