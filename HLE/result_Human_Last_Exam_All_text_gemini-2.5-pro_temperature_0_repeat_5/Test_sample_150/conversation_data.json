    "Answering this question requires a multi-step analysis.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Problem Statement\n\n1.  **Initial State:** A single integer variable `x` starts at `0`.\n2.  **Input:**\n    *   An integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 150), representing the number of statements.\n    *   `n` lines, each containing one statement.\n3.  **Statements:** There are four possible statements:\n    *   `++X` (pre-increment)\n    *   `X++` (post-increment)\n    *   `--X` (pre-decrement)\n    *   `X--` (post-decrement)\n4.  **Operations:**\n    *   Any statement containing `++` increases `x` by 1.\n    *   Any statement containing `--` decreases `x` by 1.\n5.  **Goal:** Calculate and print the final value of `x` after executing all `n` statements.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Submitted Java Program\n\n```java\n// ... imports and class definition ...\npublic static void main(String[] args)\n{\n    Scanner inpt = new Scanner(System.in);\n\n    int t = inpt.nextInt(); // Reads n\n    int tresult = 0;        // This is our x, initialized to 0\n    while (t-- > 0)\n    {\n        String test = inpt.next(); // Reads a statement like \"X++\"\n        \n        // This block checks ONLY for \"++X\"\n        if (test.contains(\"++X\")) \n        {\n            tresult++;\n        }\n        // This block checks ONLY for \"--X\"\n        if (test.contains(\"--X\"))\n        {\n            tresult--;\n        }  \n    }\n    System.out.println(tresult);\n    inpt.close();\n}\n```\n\n**Careful Points & Flaws:**\n\n1.  **Incomplete Logic:** The core logic is flawed. The problem states the operation and variable can be in any order. The code checks for `++X` and `--X` but completely ignores `X++` and `X--`.\n2.  **`String.contains()`:** While `test.contains(\"++X\")` would technically work for the string \"++X\", it's not the most robust or efficient check. A more fundamental issue is that it doesn't account for all valid inputs.\n3.  **Conclusion on Correctness:** The program is **incorrect**. It will produce the wrong answer if the input contains `X++` or `X--`. For example, if the input is `1` followed by `X++`, the program will output `0` instead of the correct answer `1`.\n\n### Step 3: Design the Most Efficient C Program\n\nSince the provided program is incorrect, we need to design a new one in C that is both fast and memory-efficient, as per the prompt.\n\n**Efficiency Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Fastest Operation Check:** The key is to distinguish between an increment and a decrement. All four possible statements (`++X`, `X++`, `--X`, `X--`) are three characters long. The character at the middle index (index 1) is unique to the operation:\n    *   For `++X` and `X++`, the middle character is `+`.\n    *   For `--X` and `X--`, the middle character is `-`.\n    Therefore, we only need to read the input string and check the character at index 1. This is the fastest possible check, requiring only a single character comparison per statement.\n\n2.  **Least Memory Usage:** To minimize memory, we should only declare the essential variables.\n    *   An `int` to store `n`.\n    *   An `int` to store the result `x`.\n    *   A loop structure. Using `while (n-- > 0)` avoids the need for a separate loop counter variable (like `i` in a `for` loop).\n    *   A way to read the input. Instead of allocating a character array (e.g., `char s[4];` which takes 4 bytes), we can read character by character using `getchar()` and only store the one character we need to inspect, which requires a single `char` variable (1 byte).\n\n**Optimal C Implementation Logic:**\n\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main() {\n    int n;\n    scanf(\"%d\", &n); // Read n\n    getchar(); // Consume the newline character left by scanf\n\n    int x = 0;\n    while (n-- > 0) {\n        getchar(); // Read and discard the first character\n        char op = getchar(); // Read the middle character\n        if (op == '+') {\n            x++;\n        } else { // It must be '-'\n            x--;\n        }\n        getchar(); // Read and discard the third character\n        getchar(); // Read and discard the newline for this line\n    }\n    printf(\"%d\\n\", x);\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Step 4: Calculate `x` (Character Comparisons) and `y` (Memory Size)\n\nBased on the optimal C program design:\n\n*   **`x` (Smallest number of character comparisons for 100 instructions):**\n    *   The logic `if (op == '+')` performs exactly **one** character comparison per statement.\n    *   For 100 instructions, the total number of comparisons is `100 * 1 = 100`.\n    *   Therefore, `x = 100`.\n\n*   **`y` (Smallest memory size in Bytes):**\n    *   We need to account for the memory used by the variables declared in our most memory-efficient design. (Assuming a standard 32/64-bit system where `int` is 4 bytes and `char` is 1 byte).\n    *   `int n;`: 4 bytes\n    *   `int x;`: 4 bytes\n    *   `char op;`: 1 byte\n    *   Total memory for variables = `4 + 4 + 1 = 9` bytes.\n    *   Therefore, `y = 9`.\n\n### Step 5: Final Answer Formulation\n\nThe final answer must be in the format `Nx+y`.\n\n*   The program is incorrect, so we start with `N`.\n*   `x` is `100`.\n*   `y` is `9`.\n\nCombining these parts gives the final answer.\n\n<<<N100+9>>>"
