    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the equilibrium values of entropy and mean energy for the Bose case of light quanta (photons).\n\n### **Analysis of the Question and Method**\n\nThe question asks for the equilibrium entropy and mean energy of a photon gas, using the framework of large deviation theory (Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramer-Chernoff theorems).\n\n**Careful Points:**\n1.  **System:** The system is a gas of light quanta (photons). Photons are bosons, so they obey Bose-Einstein statistics.\n2.  **Indistinguishability:** Photons are indistinguishable particles.\n3.  **Non-conservation of Particle Number:** A crucial property of a photon gas in thermal equilibrium is that the total number of photons is not conserved (photons can be created and absorbed by the walls of the container). This implies that the chemical potential, $\\mu$, is zero.\n4.  **Large Deviation Theory Connection:** The Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramer-Chernoff theorems provide a rigorous mathematical foundation for the principles of statistical mechanics.\n    *   **Sanov's Theorem** relates the probability of observing a particular empirical distribution of particles among energy states to the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. The equilibrium state is the most probable one, which corresponds to the distribution that minimizes this divergence.\n    *   This minimization principle is equivalent to the **Principle of Maximum Entropy**: The equilibrium distribution of a system is the one that maximizes the system's entropy, subject to macroscopic constraints (like fixed mean energy).\n    *   Therefore, the role of these theorems is to justify the use of the maximum entropy method to find the equilibrium state.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Derivation**\n\n**Step 1: Define the Entropy for a Bose Gas**\n\nFor a system of indistinguishable bosons distributed among energy levels $\\epsilon_i$ with degeneracy $g_i$ (number of states at that energy level), the number of microstates for a given set of occupation numbers $\\{n_i\\}$ is:\n$\\Omega_{BE} = \\prod_i \\frac{(n_i + g_i - 1)!}{n_i! (g_i - 1)!}$\n\nThe entropy of the system is given by the Boltzmann formula, $S = k_B \\ln \\Omega$. Using Stirling's approximation ($\\ln N! \\approx N \\ln N - N$) for large $n_i$ and $g_i$, the entropy becomes:\n$S = k_B \\sum_i \\left[ (n_i + g_i) \\ln(n_i + g_i) - n_i \\ln n_i - g_i \\ln g_i \\right]$\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Macroscopic Constraints**\n\n1.  **Fixed Mean Energy:** The system is in thermal equilibrium, which is characterized by a constant total mean energy, $E$.\n    $E = \\sum_i n_i \\epsilon_i$\n2.  **No Particle Number Constraint:** As mentioned, the number of photons $N = \\sum_i n_i$ is not conserved, so there is no constraint on $N$.\n\n**Step 3: Apply the Principle of Maximum Entropy**\n\nTo find the equilibrium values, we maximize the entropy $S$ subject to the energy constraint. We use the method of Lagrange multipliers. We define a function $\\mathcal{L}$ to be maximized:\n$\\mathcal{L} = \\frac{S}{k_B} - \\beta \\left( \\sum_i n_i \\epsilon_i - E \\right)$\nHere, $\\beta$ is the Lagrange multiplier associated with the energy constraint. We will later identify it with $1/(k_B T)$.\n\n**Step 4: Perform the Maximization**\n\nWe find the maximum by setting the partial derivative of $\\mathcal{L}$ with respect to each $n_i$ to zero:\n$\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial n_i} = \\frac{1}{k_B} \\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial n_i} - \\beta \\epsilon_i = 0$\n\nLet's compute the derivative of the entropy term:\n$\\frac{1}{k_B} \\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial n_i} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial n_i} \\left[ (n_i + g_i) \\ln(n_i + g_i) - n_i \\ln n_i - g_i \\ln g_i \\right]$\n$= \\left[ \\ln(n_i + g_i) + 1 \\right] - \\left[ \\ln n_i + 1 \\right] = \\ln\\left(\\frac{n_i + g_i}{n_i}\\right)$\n\nSubstituting this back into the maximization condition:\n$\\ln\\left(\\frac{n_i + g_i}{n_i}\\right) - \\beta \\epsilon_i = 0 \\implies \\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{g_i}{n_i}\\right) = \\beta \\epsilon_i$\n\n**Step 5: Find the Equilibrium Occupation Number**\n\nSolving for $n_i$ from the equation above:\n$1 + \\frac{g_i}{n_i} = e^{\\beta \\epsilon_i} \\implies \\frac{g_i}{n_i} = e^{\\beta \\epsilon_i} - 1$\n$n_i = \\frac{g_i}{e^{\\beta \\epsilon_i} - 1}$\n\nThis is the **Bose-Einstein distribution** for particles with zero chemical potential, which describes the equilibrium occupation of energy levels for a photon gas.\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the Equilibrium Mean Energy (E)**\n\nTo find the total energy $E$, we sum over all energy levels. For a continuous spectrum of energies, we replace the sum with an integral and use the density of states $g(\\epsilon)$ for photons in a 3D box of volume $V$. This density includes a factor of 2 for the two possible polarizations:\n$g(\\epsilon) d\\epsilon = \\frac{8 \\pi V}{h^3 c^3} \\epsilon^2 d\\epsilon$\n\nThe total energy is:\n$E = \\int_0^\\infty \\epsilon \\cdot n(\\epsilon) d\\epsilon = \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{\\epsilon \\cdot g(\\epsilon)}{e^{\\beta \\epsilon} - 1} d\\epsilon = \\frac{8 \\pi V}{h^3 c^3} \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{\\epsilon^3}{e^{\\beta \\epsilon} - 1} d\\epsilon$\n\nTo solve the integral, we make the substitution $x = \\beta \\epsilon$:\n$E = \\frac{8 \\pi V}{h^3 c^3} \\frac{1}{\\beta^4} \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{x^3}{e^x - 1} dx$\n\nThe definite integral is a standard form related to the Riemann zeta function: $\\int_0^\\infty \\frac{x^3}{e^x - 1} dx = \\Gamma(4)\\zeta(4) = 6 \\cdot \\frac{\\pi^4}{90} = \\frac{\\pi^4}{15}$.\nSubstituting this value and $\\beta = 1/(k_B T)$:\n\n$E = \\frac{8 \\pi V}{h^3 c^3} (k_B T)^4 \\frac{\\pi^4}{15} = \\left( \\frac{8 \\pi^5 k_B^4}{15 h^3 c^3} \\right) V T^4$\n\nThis is the **Stefan-Boltzmann Law** for the total energy of black-body radiation.\n\n**Step 7: Calculate the Equilibrium Entropy (S)**\n\nWe can find the entropy by substituting the equilibrium distribution back into the entropy formula. A more direct thermodynamic relation for a photon gas is $E = F + TS$, where the Helmholtz free energy is $F = -k_B T \\ln Z$. For photons ($\\mu=0$), the grand potential and Helmholtz free energy are equal.\nA simpler relation can be derived:\n$S = \\frac{E - F}{T} = \\frac{E}{T} + k_B \\ln Z$\n$\\ln Z = -\\sum_i g_i \\ln(1 - e^{-\\beta \\epsilon_i})$\n\nBy integrating by parts, one can show that the integral for $F$ is related to the integral for $E$, leading to a simple relationship between $S$ and $E$:\n$F = -E/3$\n\nTherefore, $S = \\frac{E - F}{T} = \\frac{E - (-E/3)}{T} = \\frac{4E}{3T}$.\n\nSubstituting the expression for $E$:\n$S = \\frac{4}{3T} \\left[ \\left( \\frac{8 \\pi^5 k_B^4}{15 h^3 c^3} \\right) V T^4 \\right] = \\left( \\frac{32 \\pi^5 k_B^4}{45 h^3 c^3} \\right) V T^3$\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nThe equilibrium values for a photon gas in a volume $V$ at temperature $T$ are:\n\n*   **Mean Energy (E):**\n    $E = \\left( \\frac{8 \\pi^5 k_B^4}{15 h^3 c^3} \\right) V T^4$\n\n*   **Entropy (S):**\n    $S = \\left( \\frac{32 \\pi^5 k_B^4}{45 h^3 c^3} \\right) V T^3$\n\nwhere $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, $h$ is the Planck constant, and $c$ is the speed of light.\n\n<<<**Mean Energy:** $E = \\left( \\frac{8 \\pi^5 k_B^4}{15 h^3 c^3} \\right) V T^4$\n**Entropy:** $S = \\left( \\frac{32 \\pi^5 k_B^4}{45 h^3 c^3} \\right) V T^3$>>>"
