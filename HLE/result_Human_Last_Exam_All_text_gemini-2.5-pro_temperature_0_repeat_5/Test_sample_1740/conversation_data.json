    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of let-7 family members in humans.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Question:** The core of the question is to find the total count of members belonging to the \"let-7 family\" of microRNAs that have been identified specifically in humans (*Homo sapiens*). The phrase \"to date\" implies we should use the most current, established scientific consensus.\n\n2.  **Define \"let-7 Family Member\":** In molecular biology, a gene family consists of several similar genes that arose from duplication events. For microRNAs (miRNAs), a \"family\" includes distinct miRNA genes that produce mature miRNAs with highly similar sequences, particularly in the critical \"seed region.\" Therefore, a \"member\" of the let-7 family is best defined as a distinct gene that codes for a let-7 precursor miRNA. This is a more precise count than counting the mature miRNA sequences, as some distinct genes can produce the same mature miRNA.\n\n3.  **Identify the Main Types of let-7 Mature miRNAs:** The human let-7 family is composed of several closely related mature miRNAs. The canonical types are:\n    *   let-7a\n    *   let-7b\n    *   let-7c\n    *   let-7d\n    *   let-7e\n    *   let-7f\n    *   let-7g\n    *   let-7i\n    *   miR-98 (which is structurally and functionally part of the let-7 family)\n\n    This gives us 9 distinct types of mature let-7 miRNAs.\n\n4.  **Count the Genes (Precursor miRNAs) for Each Type:** The next and most crucial step is to count how many distinct genes (loci) in the human genome code for these miRNAs. We consult authoritative databases like miRBase for this information.\n\n    *   **let-7a:** is encoded by **3** separate genes (`hsa-let-7a-1`, `hsa-let-7a-2`, `hsa-let-7a-3`).\n    *   **let-7b:** is encoded by **1** gene (`hsa-let-7b`).\n    *   **let-7c:** is encoded by **1** gene (`hsa-let-7c`).\n    *   **let-7d:** is encoded by **1** gene (`hsa-let-7d`).\n    *   **let-7e:** is encoded by **1** gene (`hsa-let-7e`).\n    *   **let-7f:** is encoded by **2** separate genes (`hsa-let-7f-1`, `hsa-let-7f-2`).\n    *   **let-7g:** is encoded by **1** gene (`hsa-let-7g`).\n    *   **let-7i:** is encoded by **1** gene (`hsa-let-7i`).\n    *   **miR-98:** is encoded by **1** gene (`hsa-mir-98`).\n\n5.  **Calculate the Total Number of Members:** To get the total number of family members, we sum the number of genes identified in the previous step.\n\n    Total members = (genes for let-7a) + (genes for let-7b) + (genes for let-7c) + (genes for let-7d) + (genes for let-7e) + (genes for let-7f) + (genes for let-7g) + (genes for let-7i) + (genes for miR-98)\n    Total members = 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 = **12**\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Ambiguity of \"Member\":** The term \"member\" could be interpreted as either the number of distinct mature miRNAs (which is 9) or the number of distinct genes (which is 12). In genetics and genomics, \"family member\" almost always refers to the distinct gene loci. Therefore, 12 is the more accurate and standard answer.\n*   **Data Source:** It is critical to rely on an authoritative and up-to-date database. miRBase is the primary repository for miRNA sequences and annotation and is the standard reference in the field. The count of 12 is based on the current version of miRBase.\n*   **Excluding Other miRNAs:** Some other miRNAs might have sequence similarities or be located near let-7 genes, but they are not considered canonical members of the family (e.g., miR-202, miR-4500). The analysis focuses only on the well-established members.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the analysis of distinct genes encoding for the let-7 family of microRNAs in the human genome, there are 12 members.\n\n<<<12>>>"
