    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the System\nThe problem describes a quantum memory system based on the surface code. We need to break down the description into its fundamental components:\n*   **Code Type:** Surface Code. This is a topological quantum error-correcting code defined on a 2D surface.\n*   **Number of Components:** \"Two patches\". This means we have two physically separate and independent surface code systems. The total number of logical qubits will be the sum of the logical qubits from each patch.\n*   **Topology of Each Component:** Each patch has \"two holes\". A standard surface code \"patch\" is a planar surface, which is topologically equivalent to a disk. Adding holes changes its topology.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze a Single Patch\nLet's first determine how many logical qubits can be encoded in a single patch of surface code with two holes.\n\n*   **Topological Properties:** A single patch can be thought of as a 2D plane (which has a genus, `g=0`). It has an outer boundary. Creating a \"hole\" in the surface code means defining an additional, inner boundary where the code lattice is terminated.\n*   **Counting Boundaries:** A patch with two holes has:\n    1.  One outer boundary.\n    2.  Two inner boundaries (one for each hole).\n    This gives a total of `b = 3` boundaries.\n*   **Formula for Logical Qubits:** For a single, connected surface code, the number of logical qubits (`k`) it can encode is determined by its topology, specifically its genus (`g`) and number of boundaries (`b`). The formula is:\n    `k = 2g + b - 1`\n*   **Calculation for a Single Patch:**\n    *   The genus `g` of a planar patch is 0.\n    *   The number of boundaries `b` is 3.\n    *   Plugging these values into the formula:\n        `k_patch = (2 * 0) + 3 - 1 = 2`\n    *   Therefore, a single patch of surface code with two holes can encode **2 logical qubits**.\n\n*   **Intuitive Understanding:** The number of logical qubits is related to the number of independent, non-trivial paths (for logical operators) that can be drawn on the surface. For a planar surface with `b` boundaries, there are `b-1` independent ways to connect pairs of boundaries. Each such connection, along with its dual counterpart, forms a logical qubit. With 3 boundaries, we can form `3-1 = 2` independent logical qubits.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Total Number of Logical Qubits\nNow we can calculate the total capacity of the entire system described in the question.\n\n*   The system consists of two identical, independent patches.\n*   The total number of logical qubits is the sum of the logical qubits from each patch.\n*   Number of qubits from Patch 1: `k_1 = 2`\n*   Number of qubits from Patch 2: `k_2 = 2`\n*   Total logical qubits `k_total = k_1 + k_2 = 2 + 2 = 4`.\n\n### Summary of Careful Points\n1.  **Independent Systems:** Recognize that \"two patches\" implies two separate systems whose capacities add up.\n2.  **Holes as Boundaries:** Understand that creating a hole in a surface code is equivalent to adding an inner boundary.\n3.  **Correctly Count Boundaries:** A patch with `N` holes has `N+1` total boundaries (N inner + 1 outer). For this problem, `N=2`, so there are `2+1=3` boundaries per patch.\n4.  **Apply the Correct Formula:** Use the formula `k = 2g + b - 1`. For a planar patch, `g=0`, so the formula simplifies to `k = b - 1`.\n5.  **Final Summation:** Do not forget to sum the capacities of both patches to get the final answer.\n\n### Final Answer\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, two patches of surface code, each with two holes, can encode a total of 4 logical qubits.\n\n<<<4>>>"
