    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the linguistic development of the Proto-Indo-European (PIE) root `*seh₂g-` into Proto-Germanic, Old Norse, Old English, and Old High German.\n\n### **Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n1.  **PIE Root and Form:** The starting point is the PIE verb `*seh₂gieti`. The crucial part is the root `*seh₂g-`. The `h₂` is a laryngeal consonant which affects the quality and length of the preceding vowel. The `*-ie-` suffix indicates a specific present tense formation.\n2.  **Grimm's Law:** This is the First Germanic Consonant Shift, which systematically changed PIE stop consonants in Proto-Germanic. The relevant change here is PIE `*g` > PGmc `*k`.\n3.  **Laryngeal Vocalization:** The PIE laryngeal `h₂` colors an adjacent `*e` vowel to `*a` and lengthens it when it disappears. The sequence `*eh₂` becomes `*ā`.\n4.  **Germanic Vowel Shifts:** Proto-Germanic underwent its own vowel shifts, distinct from later changes in individual languages. The key one here is PIE `*ā` > PGmc `*ō`.\n5.  **Verb Classification:** The PIE `*-ie-` suffix leads to the verb becoming a Class 1 weak verb in Germanic, characterized by a `*-j-` element in the suffix. The reconstructed Proto-Germanic infinitive is `*-janą`.\n6.  **I-Umlaut (I-Mutation):** The `*-j-` in the suffix of Class 1 weak verbs causes the root vowel to become \"fronted\" in the North and West Germanic languages (Old Norse, Old English, Old High German). The specific outcome of umlaut depends on the original vowel and the language.\n7.  **Palatalization (Old English):** In Old English, velar consonants like `k` and `g` became palatal sounds (like `ch` and `y`) when they came before front vowels.\n8.  **High German Consonant Shift:** This is the Second Consonant Shift, which distinguishes Old High German from the other Germanic languages. The relevant change here is PGmc `*k` > OHG `hh` (pronounced /x/) after a vowel.\n9.  **Diphthongization (Old High German):** Long vowels in Proto-Germanic often became diphthongs in Old High German. Here, PGmc `*ō` > OHG `uo`.\n\n---\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**Step 1: From PIE to Proto-Germanic (PGmc)**\n\n*   **Initial PIE Root:** `*seh₂g-`\n*   **Laryngeal Effect:** The sequence `*eh₂` becomes `*ā`. The root becomes `*sāg-`.\n*   **Grimm's Law:** The voiced stop `*g` becomes the voiceless stop `*k`. The root becomes `*sāk-`.\n*   **Germanic Vowel Shift:** The long vowel `*ā` becomes `*ō`. The root is now `*sōk-`.\n*   **Verb Formation:** As a Class 1 weak verb, the infinitive is formed with the suffix `*-janą`.\n*   **Proto-Germanic Result:** **`*sōkijaną`** ('to seek').\n\n**Step 2: From Proto-Germanic to Old Norse (ON)**\n\n*   **Starting Form:** PGmc `*sōkijaną`\n*   **I-Umlaut:** The `*j` causes the root vowel `*ō` to front to `œ` (written as `æ` in normalized spelling).\n*   **Syncope & Ending:** The `*j` is lost after causing umlaut. The infinitive ending `*-aną` reduces to `-a`.\n*   **Old Norse Result:** **`sækja`** ('to seek').\n\n**Step 3: From Proto-Germanic to Old English (OE)**\n\n*   **Starting Form:** PGmc `*sōkijaną`\n*   **I-Umlaut:** The `*j` causes the root vowel `*ō` to front to `ē`. The stem becomes `*sēk-`.\n*   **Palatalization:** The velar consonant `k` is now preceded by `s` and followed by the new front vowel `ē`. This environment causes `k` to palatalize to the affricate /tʃ/, written as `c`.\n*   **Syncope & Ending:** The `*j` is lost. The infinitive ending `*-aną` becomes `-an`.\n*   **Old English Result:** **`sēcan`** ('to seek').\n\n**Step 4: From Proto-Germanic to Old High German (OHG)**\n\n*   **Starting Form:** PGmc `*sōkijaną`\n*   **High German Consonant Shift:** The `*k` after a vowel shifts to the voiceless fricative `hh` (pronounced /x/). The stem becomes `*sōhh-`.\n*   **Diphthongization:** The long vowel `*ō` breaks into the diphthong `uo`. The stem is now `*suohh-`.\n*   **Ending:** The infinitive ending `*-aną` becomes `-an` or `-en`. The `*j` is lost. (Note: I-umlaut of `uo` to `üe` occurs in other parts of the verb's conjugation but is often not written in the standard infinitive form).\n*   **Old High German Result:** **`suohhen`** ('to seek, to visit').\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n*   **Proto-Germanic:** `*sōkijaną`\n*   **Old Norse:** `sækja`\n*   **Old English:** `sēcan`\n*   **Old High German:** `suohhen`\n\n<<<Proto-Germanic: *sōkijaną; Old Norse: sækja; Old English: sēcan; Old High German: suohhen>>>"
