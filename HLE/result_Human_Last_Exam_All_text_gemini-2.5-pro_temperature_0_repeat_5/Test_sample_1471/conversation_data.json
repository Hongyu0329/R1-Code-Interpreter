    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Question**\nThe question asks to solve the mathematical equation `XXIV / CCC - CCCLXXXI = ?`. The equation is written using Roman numerals and involves division and subtraction. The answer should be provided in modern (Arabic) numbers.\n\n**Step 2: List Careful Points**\n1.  **Roman Numeral Conversion:** Each Roman numeral must be accurately converted to its modern number equivalent.\n    *   `XXIV`\n    *   `CCC`\n    *   `CCCLXXXI`\n2.  **Rules of Roman Numerals:** Remember the additive principle (e.g., `XX` = 10+10) and the subtractive principle (e.g., `IV` = 5-1).\n3.  **Order of Operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS):** The calculation must follow the correct mathematical order. In this case, division must be performed before subtraction.\n\n**Step 3: Step-by-Step Analysis to Acquire the Final Answer**\n\n1.  **Convert each Roman numeral to a modern number:**\n    *   `XXIV` = `X` (10) + `X` (10) + `IV` (5 - 1) = 20 + 4 = **24**\n    *   `CCC` = `C` (100) + `C` (100) + `C` (100) = **300**\n    *   `CCCLXXXI` = `CCC` (300) + `LXXX` (50 + 10 + 10 + 10) + `I` (1) = 300 + 80 + 1 = **381**\n\n2.  **Rewrite the equation using modern numbers:**\n    The original equation `XXIV / CCC - CCCLXXXI` becomes `24 / 300 - 381`.\n\n3.  **Perform the calculation according to the order of operations:**\n    *   **First, perform the division:**\n        `24 / 300 = 0.08`\n    *   **Next, perform the subtraction:**\n        `0.08 - 381 = -380.92`\n\n**Step 4: Final Answer**\nThe solution to the equation is -380.92.\n\n<<<-380.92>>>"
