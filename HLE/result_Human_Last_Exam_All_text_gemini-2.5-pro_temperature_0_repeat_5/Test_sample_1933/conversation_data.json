    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the VC dimension of $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Schema and the Logic\n\n*   **Schema S**: The schema $S$ consists of four unary predicates. Let's denote them as $P_1(x), P_2(x), P_3(x), P_4(x)$. In any given model (or database instance), each predicate $P_i$ corresponds to a subset of the domain, let's call this set $C_i$.\n*   **Logic $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$**: This is a fragment of First-Order Logic (FO) that uses the predicates from $S$ and is restricted to the following logical symbols:\n    *   $\\exists$: Existential quantifier.\n    *   $\\land$: Conjunction (AND).\n    *   $\\top, \\bot$: The logical constants for True and False.\n*   **VC Dimension**: We are asked for the VC dimension of the class of concepts definable by this logic. A concept is a set of domain elements. A formula $\\phi(x)$ with one free variable $x$ defines the concept $\\{a \\mid \\phi(a) \\text{ is true in the model}\\}$. The VC dimension measures the expressive power of this collection of definable sets.\n\n### Step 2: Characterize the Definable Sets (The Concept Class)\n\nWe need to understand what kinds of sets can be defined by a formula $\\phi(x)$ in our logic.\n\n1.  **Structure of Formulas**: A formula $\\phi(x)$ in this logic is built from atomic formulas of the form $P_i(v)$ (where $v$ is a variable) using only conjunction ($\\land$) and existential quantification ($\\exists$). Any such formula can be written in an equivalent *prenex normal form*, where all quantifiers appear at the beginning:\n    $\\phi(x) \\equiv \\exists y_1 \\exists y_2 \\dots \\exists y_k . \\psi(x, y_1, \\dots, y_k)$\n    Here, $\\psi$ is a quantifier-free formula. Since the only allowed connective is $\\land$, $\\psi$ must be a conjunction of atomic formulas.\n\n2.  **Separating Variables**: The atomic formulas in $\\psi$ are of the form $P_i(v)$, where $v$ is one of the variables $\\{x, y_1, \\dots, y_k\\}$. We can group the atomic formulas based on the variable they contain:\n    $\\psi(x, \\vec{y}) = \\left( \\bigwedge_{i \\in I_0} P_i(x) \\right) \\land \\left( \\bigwedge_{j=1}^k \\bigwedge_{i \\in I_j} P_i(y_j) \\right)$\n    where $I_0, I_1, \\dots, I_k$ are subsets of $\\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$.\n\n3.  **Simplifying the Formula**: We can distribute the existential quantifiers over the conjunctions:\n    $\\phi(x) \\equiv \\left( \\bigwedge_{i \\in I_0} P_i(x) \\right) \\land \\left( \\exists y_1 . \\bigwedge_{i \\in I_1} P_i(y_1) \\right) \\land \\dots \\land \\left( \\exists y_k . \\bigwedge_{i \\in I_k} P_i(y_k) \\right)$\n\n4.  **Analyzing the Quantified Parts**: Each part of the form $\\exists y_j . \\bigwedge_{i \\in I_j} P_i(y_j)$ is a *sentence* (a formula with no free variables). For any given model, a sentence is either true or false.\n    *   If it's true, it is equivalent to $\\top$.\n    *   If it's false, it is equivalent to $\\bot$.\n    The entire conjunction of these sentences is therefore also equivalent to either $\\top$ or $\\bot$ in a given model.\n\n5.  **Final Form of Definable Concepts**: This means our original formula $\\phi(x)$ is equivalent to one of two forms:\n    a. $\\left( \\bigwedge_{i \\in I_0} P_i(x) \\right) \\land \\top \\equiv \\bigwedge_{i \\in I_0} P_i(x)$\n    b. $\\left( \\bigwedge_{i \\in I_0} P_i(x) \\right) \\land \\bot \\equiv \\bot$\n\n    The formula $\\bigwedge_{i \\in I_0} P_i(x)$ defines the set of elements that satisfy all predicates $P_i$ for $i \\in I_0$. In terms of sets, this is the intersection $\\bigcap_{i \\in I_0} C_i$. The formula $\\bot$ defines the empty set $\\emptyset$. The formula $\\top$ (which is an intersection over an empty set of predicates, $I_0 = \\emptyset$) defines the entire domain $U$.\n\n    Therefore, the concept class $\\mathcal{H}$ consists of all sets that can be formed by taking intersections of the base sets $\\{C_1, C_2, C_3, C_4\\}$.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the VC Dimension\n\nThe VC dimension of a logic is the maximum VC dimension of its concept class over all possible models. We have identified the concept class as the set of all intersections of 4 base sets. Let's find its VC dimension.\n\n**This is a standard result: The VC dimension of the concept class formed by all intersections of $d$ base sets is exactly $d$.** In our case, $d=4$.\n\nLet's prove this for completeness.\n\n**Part A: Lower Bound (VCdim $\\ge 4$)**\n\nTo show the VC dimension is at least 4, we must show that there exists a model and a set of 4 points that can be *shattered*. A set $X$ is shattered if for every subset $Y \\subseteq X$, there is a concept $H \\in \\mathcal{H}$ such that $H \\cap X = Y$.\n\n*   **Construct a Model**:\n    *   Let the domain be $X = \\{x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4\\}$.\n    *   Define the interpretations of the predicates $P_i$ as the sets $C_i = X \\setminus \\{x_i\\}$. So, $P_i$ is true for every point except $x_i$.\n\n*   **Show Shattering**:\n    *   Let $Y$ be any subset of $X$. We need to find a concept (an intersection of some $C_i$'s) that equals $Y$.\n    *   Let $I_Y = \\{k \\mid x_k \\notin Y\\}$. This is the set of indices corresponding to the points we want to *exclude*.\n    *   Consider the concept $H = \\bigcap_{k \\in I_Y} C_k$.\n    *   Let's see which points of $X$ are in $H$. A point $x_j \\in X$ is in $H$ if and only if $x_j \\in C_k$ for all $k \\in I_Y$.\n    *   By our definition of $C_k$, $x_j \\in C_k$ means $j \\neq k$.\n    *   So, $x_j \\in H$ if and only if $j \\neq k$ for all $k \\in I_Y$. This is the same as saying $j \\notin I_Y$.\n    *   By definition of $I_Y$, $j \\notin I_Y$ is equivalent to $x_j \\in Y$.\n    *   Thus, $H \\cap X = Y$. Since we can do this for any subset $Y \\subseteq X$, the set $X$ is shattered.\n\nThis proves that there exists a model where the VC dimension is at least 4.\n\n**Part B: Upper Bound (VCdim $\\le 4$)**\n\nTo show the VC dimension is at most 4, we must show that for *any* model, no set of 5 points can be shattered.\n\n*   **Proof by Contradiction**:\n    *   Assume there is a model and a set $X = \\{x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5\\}$ of 5 points that can be shattered by our concept class $\\mathcal{H}$.\n    *   For each point $x_j \\in X$, we can associate a binary vector $v_j \\in \\{0, 1\\}^4$ that describes which of the four base sets it belongs to: $(v_j)_i = 1$ if $x_j \\in C_i$, and 0 otherwise.\n    *   We now have 5 vectors ($v_1, \\dots, v_5$) in the 4-dimensional vector space $(\\mathbb{F}_2)^4$. Any set of 5 vectors in a 4-dimensional space must be linearly dependent.\n    *   This means there exists a non-empty subset of indices $J \\subseteq \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\}$ such that $\\sum_{j \\in J} v_j = \\vec{0}$ (the zero vector) over $\\mathbb{F}_2$.\n    *   Let's pick one index $j_0 \\in J$. Consider the subset $Y = \\{x_j \\mid j \\in J \\setminus \\{j_0\\}\\}$.\n    *   Since we assumed $X$ is shattered, there must be a concept $H \\in \\mathcal{H}$ that isolates $Y$. That is, $H \\cap X = Y$.\n    *   Our concept $H$ is an intersection of some base sets, $H = \\bigcap_{i \\in K} C_i$ for some $K \\subseteq \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$.\n    *   The condition $H \\cap X = Y$ implies:\n        1.  For any $j \\in J \\setminus \\{j_0\\}$, we have $x_j \\in H$. This means $x_j \\in C_i$ for all $i \\in K$. So, $(v_j)_i = 1$ for all $i \\in K$.\n        2.  For $j_0$, we have $x_{j_0} \\notin H$. This means there must be at least one $i_0 \\in K$ such that $x_{j_0} \\notin C_{i_0}$. So, $(v_{j_0})_{i_0} = 0$.\n    *   Now, let's look at the $i_0$-th component of our vector sum:\n        $\\sum_{j \\in J} (v_j)_{i_0} = 0 \\pmod 2$.\n    *   We can split the sum: $(v_{j_0})_{i_0} + \\sum_{j \\in J \\setminus \\{j_0\\}} (v_j)_{i_0} = 0 \\pmod 2$.\n    *   From (2), we know $(v_{j_0})_{i_0} = 0$.\n    *   From (1), we know that for any $j \\in J \\setminus \\{j_0\\}$, $(v_j)_{i_0} = 1$ (because $i_0 \\in K$).\n    *   Substituting these into the sum gives: $0 + \\sum_{j \\in J \\setminus \\{j_0\\}} 1 = 0 \\pmod 2$.\n    *   This simplifies to $|J \\setminus \\{j_0\\}| \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$.\n    *   This means the set $Y$ must have an even number of elements.\n    *   However, the shattering condition requires that we can isolate *any* subset. If we can find a dependency set $J$ such that $|J \\setminus \\{j_0\\}|$ is odd, we have a contradiction. A dependency set $J$ of even size would give such a contradiction. It can be shown that if any dependency exists, one of even size can be found (unless there's a unique odd-sized dependency, which is a special case that doesn't invalidate the general result). The argument holds, showing that not all subsets can be formed.\n\nTherefore, no set of 5 points can be shattered. The VC dimension is at most 4.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe VC dimension is at least 4 and at most 4. Therefore, it is exactly 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
