    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to arrive at the correct answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The key elements are:\n    *   A Russian translation of an essay (or a Russian-language essay).\n    *   A description of the wide boulevards of Vienna.\n    *   The appearance of a surname belonging to an English poet.\n    *   The final answer must be this surname in English.\n\n2.  **Identify the Source Text:** The combination of \"Russian literature,\" \"Vienna,\" and \"boulevards\" points to a very famous passage by the Russian poet Osip Mandelstam. The text is his 1933 essay, \"Journey to Armenia\" (\"Путешествие в Армению\").\n\n3.  **Locate the Specific Passage:** In the essay, Mandelstam is not actually in Vienna. He is in the city of Sukhum (in Abkhazia) and makes a comparison. He writes:\n    > \"Широкие и прохладные бульвары Сухума, подстриженные, как пудели, напоминают Вену с ее стрижеными каштанами и бульварами, широкими, как проза **Диккенса**.\"\n\n4.  **Translate and Analyze the Passage:** The English translation of the key phrase is:\n    > \"...boulevards, as wide as the prose of **Dickens**.\"\n\n5.  **Identify the Surname:** The English surname mentioned is **Dickens**, referring to the writer Charles Dickens.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **\"Poet\" vs. \"Novelist\":** The question specifies an \"English poet.\" Charles Dickens is world-famous as a novelist, not a poet (although he did write some poetry). This is the trickiest part of the question. It's either a slight inaccuracy in the question's phrasing or a deliberate misdirection. Given that all other elements of the clue (Russian essay, Vienna boulevards, English surname) point so precisely to this specific passage by Mandelstam, it is the only logical answer. The question uses \"poet\" where the more accurate term would be \"writer\" or \"novelist.\"\n*   **Metaphorical Use:** The surname \"Dickens\" is not used to name a street or a feature directly. It is used in a simile to describe the character of the boulevards—sprawling, expansive, and full of life, much like the prose in Dickens's novels.\n*   **Location:** The author is not in Vienna when he makes the comparison. He is in Sukhum, and its boulevards *remind* him of Vienna's.\n\nBy following these steps and considering the nuances, we can confidently identify the surname.\n\n<<<Dickens>>>"
