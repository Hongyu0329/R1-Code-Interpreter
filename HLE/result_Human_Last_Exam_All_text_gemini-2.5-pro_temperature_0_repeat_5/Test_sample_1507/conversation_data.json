    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the minimal number of triangles needed for triangulating the outer-hull of the great icosahedron.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Great Icosahedron**\nThe great icosahedron is one of the four Kepler-Poinsot polyhedra, which are non-convex regular polyhedra. It is composed of 20 intersecting equilateral triangular faces. It has 12 vertices and 30 edges. The key feature is that its faces intersect each other, meaning it is not a simple, convex shape.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the \"Outer-Hull\"**\nThe \"outer-hull\" of a non-convex object is its convex hull. The convex hull is the smallest convex shape that completely contains the object. To find the convex hull of the great icosahedron, we consider its vertices. The 12 vertices of the great icosahedron are arranged in space in the exact same positions as the 12 vertices of a regular (convex) icosahedron. Therefore, the convex hull of the great icosahedron is a regular icosahedron.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the \"Triangulation of the Outer-Hull\"**\nThe question asks for the minimal number of triangles needed to triangulate this outer-hull. The outer-hull is a regular icosahedron. A regular icosahedron is a Platonic solid, and its surface is, by definition, already composed of triangles. Specifically, it is made up of 20 equilateral triangles.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Minimal Number of Triangles**\nSince the surface of the regular icosahedron is already a perfect triangulation made of its own faces, the minimal number of triangles required is simply the number of faces the regular icosahedron has. There is no way to form this closed, convex surface with the same vertices using fewer triangles. This can be confirmed using Euler's formula for polyhedra (V - E + F = 2).\n*   For the icosahedron, the number of vertices (V) is 12.\n*   In any triangulation, each edge is shared by two triangles (2E = 3F).\n*   Substituting E = 3F/2 into Euler's formula: V - (3F/2) + F = 2\n*   12 - F/2 = 2\n*   10 = F/2\n*   F = 20\nThis confirms that any triangulation of a sphere-like surface with 12 vertices arranged like an icosahedron must have exactly 20 triangular faces.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude the Final Answer**\nThe \"visible triangles from the outside\" are the faces of the convex hull. The convex hull is a regular icosahedron, which has 20 triangular faces. Therefore, the minimal number of triangles needed is 20.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   Do not confuse the 20 intersecting faces of the great icosahedron itself with the 20 non-intersecting faces of its convex hull. The question is about the hull.\n*   The term \"triangulating\" does not imply adding new divisions. Since the surface is already made of triangles, the existing faces form the minimal triangulation.\n*   The phrase \"visible from the outside\" is a clear indicator that we should be considering the convex hull, not the complex, self-intersecting structure of the great icosahedron.\n\nThe final answer is the number of faces on a regular icosahedron.\n\n<<<20>>>"
