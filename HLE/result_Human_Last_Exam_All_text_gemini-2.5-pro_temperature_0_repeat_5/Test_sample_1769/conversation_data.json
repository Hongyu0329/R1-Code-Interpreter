    "This is a fascinating question that delves into the historical phonology of the English language. To determine the answer, we must trace the likely evolution of the original Old English word for \"sister\" without the influence of Old Norse.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Modern English word and its origins.**\n    The current word is \"sister\". It comes from Middle English *sister*, which was heavily influenced by the Old Norse word *systir*. The original native Old English word was *sweostor*. These words are cognates, meaning they both descend from the same Proto-Germanic root, *\\*swestēr*. The question is what form *sweostor* would have taken if it had evolved naturally into Modern English.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Old English word: *sweostor*.**\n    The word is pronounced roughly as \"SWE-os-tor\". It has an initial /sw/ consonant cluster, a diphthong (two-part vowel) *eo*, and an unstressed second syllable.\n\n3.  **Trace the likely phonological changes from Old English to Middle English.**\n    In the development from Old to Middle English, several changes would likely have occurred to *sweostor*:\n    *   **Simplification of the initial cluster:** The initial *sw-* before a vowel was sometimes simplified to *s-*. This can be seen in the word \"so\" from Old English *swā*.\n    *   **Vowel change:** The diphthong *eo* would have changed. More importantly, a common variant of *sweostor* already existed in late Old English and became widespread in Middle English: ***suster***. This form shows the loss of the *-w-* and a change in the vowel. This change is a native English development, not a result of borrowing.\n    *   **Reduction of the unstressed vowel:** The *-or* at the end would have its vowel reduced to a schwa sound (/ə/), resulting in a pronunciation like \"-er\", just as it did in *brōþor* (brother) and *mōdor* (mother).\n\n4.  **Establish the most likely Middle English form.**\n    Based on the points above, the most probable native form to survive into Middle English would have been ***suster***. This form is well-attested in Middle English texts from areas with less Scandinavian influence and appears to be a natural internal development of the word.\n\n5.  **Trace the development from Middle English to Modern English.**\n    Now we must project how Middle English *suster* (pronounced roughly \"SOOS-ter\") would evolve into Modern English. We can use the words \"brother\" and \"mother\" as a direct analogy.\n    *   The Middle English word for brother was *brother* (from OE *brōþor*).\n    *   The Middle English word for mother was *moder* (from OE *mōdor*).\n    *   The Middle English word for sister would have been *suster*.\n    *   During a major sound change called the \"foot-strut split,\" the /ʊ/ vowel sound (as in \"put\" or \"foot\") in words like *suster*, *brother*, and *mother* changed to the /ʌ/ vowel sound (as in \"strut\" or \"cut\").\n    *   Therefore, just as *brother* became our modern \"brother\" /brʌðər/ and *moder* became \"mother\" /mʌðər/, *suster* would have become \"suster\" /sʌstər/.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n*   **Cognate Influence vs. Borrowing:** This is not a simple case of borrowing a new word. It's a case of a closely related Old Norse word (*systir*) influencing and ultimately replacing the native Old English form (*sweostor*/*suster*) because of the similarity and the high degree of contact between the two languages. The /i/ vowel sound and the \"i\" spelling in \"sister\" are the key giveaways of the Norse influence.\n*   **Internal Variation:** Old and Middle English had significant dialectal variation. While *suster* is the most likely candidate to have become the standard, other forms like *sester* also existed and could theoretically have survived. However, the parallel with *brother* and *mother* makes *suster* the strongest contender.\n*   **Analogy is Key:** The most reliable method for this kind of counterfactual linguistics is to find parallel developments in words with similar structures that were *not* affected by the same external influence. The evolution of *brother* and *mother* provides a perfect template.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nWithout the influence of the Old Norse *systir*, the native Old English *sweostor* would have most likely evolved through the common Middle English form *suster*. Following the same phonological path as \"mother\" and \"brother,\" the Modern English word would be \"suster\".\n\n<<<suster>>>"
