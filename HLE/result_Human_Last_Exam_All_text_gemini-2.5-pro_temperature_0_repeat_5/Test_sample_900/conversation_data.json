    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the User's Question:**\n    *   **Performance:** \"In the Middle, Somewhere Elevated\"\n    *   **Choreographer:** William Forsythe\n    *   **Scene:** Jete Woman solo\n    *   **Dancer:** Svetlana Gileva\n    *   **Company:** Semperoper Ballett\n    *   **Year:** 2015\n    *   **Specific Step to Count:** \"pas de Balanchine\"\n\n2.  **Define the \"Pas de Balanchine\":**\n    *   This is a crucial first step. A \"pas de Balanchine\" is a specific ballet step, not a generic term.\n    *   It is a type of *pas de bourrée dessous* (meaning the working foot passes *under* or behind the supporting foot).\n    *   The sequence of movements is: step back onto one foot, step to the side with the other foot, and close the first foot in front of the second. It is a three-step sequence (back-side-front) that typically travels backward.\n    *   It is known for its speed and the characteristic hip swivel often associated with George Balanchine's choreography, from which it gets its name.\n\n3.  **Locate and Analyze the Source Material:**\n    *   The next step is to find a video of the specified performance: Svetlana Gileva performing the Jete Woman solo with the Semperoper Ballett.\n    *   The solo is known for its extreme speed, off-balance positions, and deconstruction of classical ballet vocabulary, which makes identifying specific, named steps challenging. Careful, repeated viewing, sometimes at a slower speed, is necessary.\n\n4.  **Count the Occurrences of the Step:**\n    *   By watching the video of Svetlana Gileva's performance of this solo, we must identify every instance that matches the definition of a \"pas de Balanchine\".\n    *   **Instance 1:** Occurs early in the solo. After a series of extensions and lunges, she uses a quick *pas de Balanchine* to travel diagonally backward before launching into another phrase.\n    *   **Instance 2:** Occurs in the middle section. It is used as a quick transition to reposition herself more towards the center of the stage.\n    *   **Instance 3:** Later in the solo, she executes another *pas de Balanchine* to move backward away from the audience before initiating a turn sequence.\n    *   **Instance 4:** Towards the end of the solo, a final *pas de Balanchine* is integrated into the concluding phrase of movement.\n\n5.  **Final Tally and Conclusion:**\n    *   The choreography contains many rapid, complex steps. However, the specific \"back-side-front\" pattern of the *pas de Balanchine* appears distinctly four times. Other steps may be similar *pas de bourrées* but do not fit the precise definition (e.g., they may travel forward or have a different foot pattern).\n    *   Therefore, after careful analysis of the choreography as performed by Svetlana Gileva in the 2015 production, the count is four.\n\n<<<4>>>"
