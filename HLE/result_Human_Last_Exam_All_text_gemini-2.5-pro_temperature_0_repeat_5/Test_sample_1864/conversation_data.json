    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the essential controls needed for your flow cytometry sorting experiment.\n\n### **Analysis of the Experimental Setup**\n\n*   **Technique:** Flow Cytometry Sorting. This requires high precision and purity, making controls especially important.\n*   **Fluorophores/Channels (5 total):** AF350, GFP, PE, AF647, AF750. This is a multi-color experiment, so spectral overlap is a major concern.\n*   **Key Reagent Mentioned:** \"Streptavidin beads\". In the context of a multi-color experiment, this most commonly refers to compensation beads used to set up the instrument to correct for spectral overlap. Some compensation beads are coated with streptavidin to easily capture biotinylated antibodies, while others capture antibodies directly. We will assume these beads are for compensation controls.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Breakdown of Essential Controls**\n\nTo ensure accurate and reproducible sorting results, a series of controls are required to address different aspects of the experiment: baseline fluorescence, spectral overlap, accurate gating, and cell viability.\n\n**1. Baseline and Viability Controls (2 controls)**\n\n*   **Unstained Control (1 tube):**\n    *   **Purpose:** To measure the baseline autofluorescence of your cells. This is the fundamental negative control used to determine where the signal from an actual fluorophore begins.\n    *   **Careful Point:** This sample should contain only your cells in the final buffer, treated identically to your stained samples (e.g., same incubation times, temperatures, and washes) but without any fluorescent reagents.\n\n*   **Viability Control (1 tube):**\n    *   **Purpose:** To establish a gate to exclude dead cells. Dead cells can non-specifically bind antibodies and exhibit increased autofluorescence, leading to false-positive results and contamination of the sorted population. This control is typically a sample of heat-killed or chemically-treated cells stained with the viability dye to create a bright \"dead\" positive population.\n    *   **Careful Point:** A viability dye (e.g., DAPI, PI, or a fixable viability dye) should be added to *all* your cell samples (unstained, FMOs, and fully stained). This single control tube is just to set the gate for it. For sorting, this is absolutely essential.\n\n**2. Compensation Controls (5 controls)**\n\n*   **Single-Stain Controls (1 tube for each fluorophore):**\n    *   **Purpose:** To correct for spectral overlap, which is the signal from one fluorophore \"spilling over\" into another's detector. The software uses these single-positive samples to calculate a compensation matrix. With five colors, this is mandatory.\n    *   **Samples Needed:**\n        1.  Beads (or cells) + AF350 reagent\n        2.  Beads (or cells) + GFP reagent (or GFP-expressing cells)\n        3.  Beads (or cells) + PE reagent\n        4.  Beads (or cells) + AF647 reagent\n        5.  Beads (or cells) + AF750 reagent\n    *   **Careful Point:** The prompt's mention of \"Streptavidin beads\" strongly suggests using compensation beads. This is best practice, as beads provide a bright, clean signal. You must use the exact same fluorescent antibody/reagent on the beads as you use on your cells, and it must be at least as bright as the signal on your cells.\n\n**3. Gating Controls (5 controls)**\n\n*   **Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls (1 tube for each fluorophore):**\n    *   **Purpose:** To accurately set the boundaries (gates) for your positive populations. An FMO control contains all the stains in your panel *except for one*. This reveals the cumulative effect of spectral spread from all other fluorophores into the empty channel, which is often much wider than the signal from the unstained sample.\n    *   **Samples Needed:**\n        1.  FMO for AF350 (cells stained with everything *except* the AF350 reagent)\n        2.  FMO for GFP (cells stained with everything *except* the GFP reagent)\n        3.  FMO for PE (cells stained with everything *except* the PE reagent)\n        4.  FMO for AF647 (cells stained with everything *except* the AF647 reagent)\n        5.  FMO for AF750 (cells stained with everything *except* the AF750 reagent)\n    *   **Careful Point:** For a sorting experiment where the goal is to isolate a pure population defined by one or more of these markers, FMO controls are essential for accurate gating. Without them, you risk including false positives or excluding true positives from your sort gate.\n\n### **Summary of Essential Controls**\n\nBy summing up the controls from each category, we get the total number required for a robust experiment.\n\n*   Unstained Control: **1**\n*   Viability Positive Control: **1**\n*   Single-Stain Compensation Controls: **5** (one for each fluorophore)\n*   Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Gating Controls: **5** (one for each fluorophore)\n\n**Total Essential Controls = 1 + 1 + 5 + 5 = 12**\n\nIn addition to these 12 control tubes, you will have your fully stained experimental sample(s) that you intend to sort.\n\n<<<12>>>"
