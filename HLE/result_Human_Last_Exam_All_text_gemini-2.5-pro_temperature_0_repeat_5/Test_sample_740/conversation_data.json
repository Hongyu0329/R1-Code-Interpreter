    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Integral Equation**\nThe given equation is a Fredholm integral equation of the second kind:\n`u(x) = f(x) + λ ∫ₐᵇ K(x, y) u(y) dy`\nIn our case, `f(x) = 1`, `a=0`, `b=1`, and the kernel is `K(x, y) = (xⁿ - yⁿ) / (x - y)`. We assume `n` is a positive integer.\n\n**Step 2: Simplify the Kernel**\nThe kernel can be simplified using the formula for the difference of powers:\n`xⁿ - yⁿ = (x - y)(xⁿ⁻¹ + xⁿ⁻²y + ... + xyⁿ⁻² + yⁿ⁻¹)`.\nSo, for `x ≠ y`, the kernel is:\n`K(x, y) = xⁿ⁻¹ + xⁿ⁻²y + ... + yⁿ⁻¹ = ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) x^(n-1-k) y^k`.\nThis is a degenerate (or separable) kernel, as it is a finite sum of products of functions of `x` and functions of `y`.\n\n**Step 3: Convert the Integral Equation to a System of Linear Equations**\nSubstitute the expanded kernel back into the equation:\n`u(x) = 1 + λ ∫₀¹ [∑_(k=0)^(n-1) x^(n-1-k) y^k] u(y) dy`\nWe can swap the integral and the sum:\n`u(x) = 1 + λ ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) x^(n-1-k) ∫₀¹ y^k u(y) dy`\nLet's define the constants `c_k` as the moments of `u(y)`:\n`c_k = ∫₀¹ y^k u(y) dy` for `k = 0, 1, ..., n-1`.\nThe solution `u(x)` must then have the form of a polynomial of degree at most `n-1`:\n`u(x) = 1 + λ ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) c_k x^(n-1-k)`\nTo find the unknown constants `c_j`, we substitute this form of `u(x)` back into their definition:\n`c_j = ∫₀¹ y^j [1 + λ ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) c_k y^(n-1-k)] dy`\n`c_j = ∫₀¹ y^j dy + λ ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) c_k ∫₀¹ y^(j + n - 1 - k) dy`\nPerforming the integrations gives:\n`c_j = 1/(j+1) + λ ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) c_k / (j + n - k)`\nThis is a system of `n` linear equations for the `n` unknowns `c₀, ..., c_(n-1)`. We can write it in matrix form as `(I - λA)c = b`, where:\n*   `c` is the column vector `[c₀, ..., c_(n-1)]ᵀ`.\n*   `b` is the column vector `[1/1, 1/2, ..., 1/n]ᵀ`, with `b_j = 1/(j+1)`.\n*   `A` is the `n x n` matrix with entries `A_jk = 1/(j + n - k)`.\n\n**Step 4: Apply the Fredholm Alternative Theorem**\nThe system of linear equations `(I - λA)c = b` has a unique solution if the matrix `(I - λA)` is invertible, i.e., `det(I - λA) ≠ 0`.\nIf `det(I - λA) = 0`, the equation may have no solution or infinitely many solutions. This condition is equivalent to `det(A - (1/λ)I) = 0`, which means `μ = 1/λ` must be an eigenvalue of the matrix `A`. The corresponding values of `λ` are called the characteristic values of the integral equation.\n\nAccording to the Fredholm alternative theorem, for a characteristic value `λ`, the inhomogeneous equation has a solution if and only if the forcing term `b` is orthogonal to every vector in the null space of the adjoint operator `(I - λA)ᵀ`.\nThe null space of `(I - λA)ᵀ = I - λAᵀ` consists of the eigenvectors `d` of the matrix `Aᵀ` corresponding to the eigenvalue `μ = 1/λ`.\nSo, for a given characteristic value `λ`, a solution exists if and only if `dᵀb = 0` for all eigenvectors `d` of `Aᵀ` with eigenvalue `1/λ`. If `dᵀb ≠ 0`, there is no solution.\n\n**Step 5: Analyze the Solvability Condition `dᵀb = 0`**\nWe need to determine if `dᵀb` is zero or not. Let's analyze the matrices and vectors involved.\n*   `A_jk = 1/(j+n-k)`.\n*   `Aᵀ_jk = A_kj = 1/(k+n-j)`.\n*   `b_j = 1/(j+1)`.\nThe eigenvector equation for `Aᵀ` is `Aᵀd = μd`, which is `∑_(k=0)^(n-1) A_kj d_k = μ d_j`.\n\nLet's introduce the Hilbert matrix `H`, where `H_jk = 1/(j+k+1)`. `H` is symmetric and invertible.\nLet `J` be the anti-identity matrix (`J_jk = 1` if `j+k = n-1`, `0` otherwise). `J` is its own inverse (`J²=I`).\nWe can express `A` and `b` in terms of `H` and `J`:\n*   `A = HJ`. Check: `(HJ)_jk = ∑_p H_jp J_pk = H_j,n-1-k = 1/(j + (n-1-k) + 1) = 1/(j+n-k)`. This is correct.\n*   `b` is the first column of `H`. `b = He₀`, where `e₀ = [1, 0, ..., 0]ᵀ`.\n\nThe adjoint matrix is `Aᵀ = (HJ)ᵀ = JᵀHᵀ = JH` (since `J` and `H` are symmetric).\nThe eigenvector equation is `JHd = μd`.\nThe solvability condition is `dᵀb = 0`. Let's transform this expression:\n`dᵀb = dᵀ(He₀) = (dᵀH)e₀`.\nFrom the eigenvector equation, `JHd = μd`. Multiplying by `J` from the left gives `Hd = μJd`.\nSo, `dᵀH = (Hd)ᵀ = (μJd)ᵀ = μdᵀJᵀ = μdᵀJ`.\nSubstituting this back into the expression for `dᵀb`:\n`dᵀb = (μdᵀJ)e₀ = μ(dᵀ(Je₀))`.\n`Je₀` is the vector `e_(n-1) = [0, ..., 0, 1]ᵀ`.\nSo, `dᵀ(Je₀) = dᵀe_(n-1) = d_(n-1)`, the last component of the vector `d`.\nThis gives the crucial relationship: `dᵀb = μ d_(n-1)`.\n\n**Step 6: Prove that the Solvability Condition is Never Met**\nThe equation has no solution if `dᵀb ≠ 0`. Since `A=HJ` is a product of invertible matrices, it is invertible, so its eigenvalues `μ` are all non-zero. Thus, `dᵀb ≠ 0` is equivalent to `d_(n-1) ≠ 0`.\nWe will now show that for any eigenvector `d` of `Aᵀ`, its last component `d_(n-1)` must be non-zero.\nAssume, for the sake of contradiction, that `d_(n-1) = 0` for some eigenvector `d`.\nThe eigenvector equation `Aᵀd = μd` is `∑_(k=0)^(n-1) d_k / (k+n-j) = μ d_j` for `j=0, ..., n-1`.\nIf `d_(n-1) = 0`, the sum goes up to `n-2`.\nFor `j=n-1`, the equation becomes `∑_(k=0)^(n-2) d_k / (k+1) = μ d_(n-1) = 0`.\nThis equation `∑_(k=0)^(n-2) d_k / (k+1) = 0` can be written as `(d')ᵀb' = 0`, where `d'` and `b'` are the corresponding vectors for the problem of size `n-1`.\nFrom our crucial relation `dᵀb = μ d_(n-1)`, applied to the `(n-1)`-dimensional problem, we have `(d')ᵀb' = μ' d'_(n-2)`.\nThe eigenvalue `μ` must also be an eigenvalue for the subproblem (this can be shown by analyzing the matrix structure of the eigenvalue problem for `d` with `d_(n-1)=0`). So `μ' = μ`.\nThus, `(d')ᵀb' = 0` implies `μ d'_(n-2) = 0`. Since `μ ≠ 0`, we must have `d'_(n-2) = 0`, which means `d_(n-2) = 0`.\nBy repeating this argument, `d_(n-1)=0` implies `d_(n-2)=0`, which implies `d_(n-3)=0`, and so on, until we get `d_0=0`.\nThis means `d` must be the zero vector, which cannot be an eigenvector.\nThis contradiction shows that our assumption was false. Therefore, `d_(n-1)` can never be zero for any eigenvector `d`.\n\n**Step 7: Final Conclusion**\nSince `d_(n-1) ≠ 0` for any eigenvector `d` of `Aᵀ`, the solvability condition `dᵀb = 0` is never satisfied for any characteristic value `λ`.\nTherefore, the equation has no solution for every characteristic value `λ`.\n\nThe values of `λ` for which the equation has no solution are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the `n x n` matrix `A` defined by `A_jk = 1/(j+n-k)` for `j, k = 0, 1, ..., n-1`.\n\n<<<The values of λ for which the equation has no solution are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the n x n matrix A whose elements are given by A_jk = 1/(j + n - k), for j, k = 0, 1, ..., n-1.>>>"
