    "This is a mate-in-3 puzzle.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Initial Position:** The white king is on g5, which is a very exposed and dangerous position. Black's pieces, particularly the knight on e5, the rook on e8, and the pawn on g6, are perfectly placed to launch a decisive attack. White's queen on a5 and rook on d8 are too far away to help defend the king.\n\n2.  **Black's First Move: `f6+`**\n    *   This is the most forcing move. The pawn on f6 delivers a check to the white king on g5.\n    *   We must analyze all of white's possible responses. The king cannot move to h5 (controlled by the rook on e8), f5 (controlled by the knight on e5), or h4 (controlled by the pawn on g6).\n    *   This leaves only one legal move for white.\n\n3.  **White's Forced Response: `Kxg6`**\n    *   White is forced to capture the checking pawn on g6 with the king. Any other move is illegal.\n\n4.  **Black's Second Move: `R8e6+`**\n    *   With the white king now on g6, black continues the attack. The rook from a8 moves to e6 to deliver another check.\n    *   This rook on e6 is crucially protected by the black knight on e5.\n    *   Let's examine the white king's options. It cannot capture the rook on e6 due to the knight's protection. It cannot move to f7 or h7 (controlled by the black king on h8). It cannot move to f5 (controlled by the knight on e5).\n    *   Again, white has only one legal move.\n\n5.  **White's Second Forced Response: `Kh5`**\n    *   The white king is forced to move to the h5 square to escape the check.\n\n6.  **Black's Third and Final Move: `R6e5#`**\n    *   This is the checkmating move. The rook that just moved to e6 now slides over to e5, delivering the final check.\n    *   Let's verify that this is mate:\n        *   The king on h5 is under attack from the rook on e5.\n        *   The king cannot capture the rook on e5 because it is still protected by the knight on e5.\n        *   The king has no escape squares: h4 and h6 are controlled by the black pawn on g6, while g4 and g5 are controlled by the black knight and rook on e5, respectively.\n        *   The check cannot be blocked.\n    *   This is a checkmate.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   The white king's initial exposed position is the critical factor.\n*   Each of black's moves must be a check to maintain the initiative and force a quick mate.\n*   The coordination between black's pieces (rooks, knight, pawn, and even the king restricting squares) is essential for the mating sequence to work.\n*   It's important to verify at each step that white has no alternative moves that could prolong the game. In this sequence, all of white's responses are forced.\n\n**Final Mating Sequence:**\n\nThe shortest mating sequence is a mate in 3 moves. The moves are as follows:\n\n1.  ... f6+\n2.  Kxg6 R8e6+\n3.  Kh5 R6e5#\n\n<<<f6+, Kxg6, R8e6+, Kh5, R6e5#>>>"
