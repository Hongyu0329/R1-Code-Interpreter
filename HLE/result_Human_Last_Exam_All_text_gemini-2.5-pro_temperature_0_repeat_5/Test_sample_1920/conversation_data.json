    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters $\\chi$ of conductor $d = 53599$ and order $6$.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**1. Factorize the Conductor `d`**\n\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of the conductor $d = 53599$.\n*   We can test small prime divisors. $d$ is not divisible by 2, 3, or 5.\n*   Dividing by 7: $53599 = 7 \\times 7657$.\n*   Now we factor 7657. Dividing by 13: $7657 = 13 \\times 589$.\n*   Finally, we factor 589. Dividing by 19: $589 = 19 \\times 31$.\n*   The primes are 7, 13, 19, and 31.\nSo, the prime factorization of the conductor is $d = 7 \\times 13 \\times 19 \\times 31$.\n\n**Careful Point:** The conductor $d$ is a square-free integer. This is a crucial piece of information that simplifies the problem.\n\n**2. Structure of the Group of Dirichlet Characters**\n\nThe group of Dirichlet characters modulo $d$, let's call it $G_d$, is isomorphic to the direct product of the groups of characters for each prime factor of $d$.\nIf $d = p_1 p_2 p_3 p_4$, then a character $\\chi$ modulo $d$ can be uniquely represented as a product:\n$\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\chi_3 \\chi_4$\nwhere $\\chi_i$ is a Dirichlet character modulo the prime $p_i$.\n\n**3. Condition for a Character to be Primitive**\n\nFor a square-free conductor $d$, a character $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\dots \\chi_k$ is **primitive** if and only if each of its component characters $\\chi_i$ is non-trivial. The trivial character is the character of order 1.\nTherefore, for $\\chi$ to be primitive, we must have $\\text{ord}(\\chi_i) > 1$ for each component $i=1, 2, 3, 4$.\n\n**4. Condition on the Order of the Character**\n\nWe are looking for characters $\\chi$ of order 6. The order of the product character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its components:\n$\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_1), \\text{ord}(\\chi_2), \\text{ord}(\\chi_3), \\text{ord}(\\chi_4)) = 6$.\n\nFor the lcm to be 6, two conditions must be met:\n*   The order of each component, $\\text{ord}(\\chi_i)$, must be a divisor of 6. So, $\\text{ord}(\\chi_i) \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 6\\}$.\n*   The set of orders must contain at least one multiple of 2 (i.e., 2 or 6) and at least one multiple of 3 (i.e., 3 or 6).\n\n**5. Combining Conditions and Counting Component Characters**\n\nCombining the conditions for primitivity and order, for a primitive character of order 6:\n*   The order of each component $\\chi_i$ must be in the set $\\{2, 3, 6\\}$.\n\nNow, we need to count how many characters of these orders exist for each prime factor. The group of characters modulo a prime $p$ is cyclic of order $\\phi(p) = p-1$. The number of elements of order $k$ in a cyclic group of order $n$ is $\\phi(k)$, provided $k$ divides $n$.\n\nLet's check this for our primes $p_1=7, p_2=13, p_3=19, p_4=31$:\n*   For $p_1=7$, the character group has order $\\phi(7)=6$.\n*   For $p_2=13$, the character group has order $\\phi(13)=12$.\n*   For $p_3=19$, the character group has order $\\phi(19)=18$.\n*   For $p_4=31$, the character group has order $\\phi(31)=30$.\n\n**Careful Point:** For all four primes, the order of the character group ($p-1$) is divisible by 6. This means that for each prime, characters of order 2, 3, and 6 exist.\n\nLet's count the number of characters for the required orders:\n*   Number of characters of order 2: $N_2 = \\phi(2) = 1$.\n*   Number of characters of order 3: $N_3 = \\phi(3) = 2$.\n*   Number of characters of order 6: $N_6 = \\phi(6) = \\phi(2)\\phi(3) = 1 \\times 2 = 2$.\n\nThis count is the same for each of the four prime components.\n\n**6. Final Calculation using the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion**\n\nWe need to count the number of ways to choose four characters $(\\chi_1, \\chi_2, \\chi_3, \\chi_4)$ such that:\n1.  $\\text{ord}(\\chi_i) \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$ for all $i$.\n2.  $\\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_1), \\text{ord}(\\chi_2), \\text{ord}(\\chi_3), \\text{ord}(\\chi_4)) = 6$.\n\nWe can solve this by finding all combinations that satisfy the first condition and then subtracting the ones that do not satisfy the second.\n\n*   **Total primitive characters whose orders divide 6:**\n    For each component $\\chi_i$, the order can be 2, 3, or 6. The number of choices for each component is $N_2 + N_3 + N_6 = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5$.\n    Since there are four components, the total number of such combinations is $5 \\times 5 \\times 5 \\times 5 = 5^4 = 625$.\n\n*   **Subtract characters whose lcm is not 6:**\n    This set of 625 characters includes those where the lcm is 2 or 3.\n    *   **Case A: lcm is 2.** This occurs if and only if all component orders are 2.\n        The number of choices for each component is $N_2 = 1$.\n        Total characters with lcm=2 is $1 \\times 1 \\times 1 \\times 1 = 1^4 = 1$.\n    *   **Case B: lcm is 3.** This occurs if and only if all component orders are 3.\n        The number of choices for each component is $N_3 = 2$.\n        Total characters with lcm=3 is $2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 2^4 = 16$.\n\nThe number of primitive characters of order exactly 6 is the total count minus the exceptions:\nNumber of characters = (Total with order dividing 6) - (Total with order 2) - (Total with order 3)\nNumber = $625 - 1 - 16 = 608$."
