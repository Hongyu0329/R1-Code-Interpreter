    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Definitions\n\n*   **Continuum:** The question specifies a \"not necessarily metric\" continuum. In topology, a continuum is defined as a **compact, connected Hausdorff space**. If it is also metrizable, it is called a metric continuum.\n*   **Indecomposable Continuum:** A continuum $X$ is called indecomposable if it cannot be expressed as the union of two proper subcontinua. A proper subcontinuum is a subset of $X$ that is a continuum itself but is not equal to $X$.\n*   **Composant:** For a point $x$ in a continuum $X$, the composant of $x$, denoted $C(x)$, is the union of all proper subcontinua of $X$ that contain the point $x$.\n*   **Properties of Composants:**\n    1.  The relation \"$y$ is in the same composant as $x$\" (i.e., there exists a proper subcontinuum containing both $x$ and $y$) is an equivalence relation on an indecomposable continuum.\n    2.  The equivalence classes of this relation are the composants.\n    3.  Therefore, the set of all distinct composants forms a partition of the continuum $X$. Every point of $X$ belongs to exactly one composant.\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing the Number of Composants\n\nThe question asks for the *smallest possible number* of composants for an indecomposable continuum. Let's analyze the possibilities.\n\n**Can an indecomposable continuum have only one composant?**\n\nLet's assume, for the sake of contradiction, that an indecomposable continuum $X$ has exactly one composant.\n\n1.  If there is only one composant, then this single composant must be the entire space $X$.\n2.  This means that for any two points $x, y \\in X$, there exists a proper subcontinuum of $X$ that contains both $x$ and $y$.\n3.  Let's take any proper subcontinuum $K$ of $X$. (Such a subcontinuum must exist, otherwise $X$ would be a single point and thus decomposable, unless it's an irreducible continuum between any two of its points, but even then singletons are proper subcontinua if the space is not a singleton).\n4.  Consider the family $\\mathcal{F}$ of all proper subcontinua of $X$ that contain $K$. This family is partially ordered by set inclusion.\n5.  By the Kuratowski-Zorn Lemma (which applies here due to the compactness of $X$), every chain in $\\mathcal{F}$ has an upper bound. Therefore, $\\mathcal{F}$ must contain a maximal element, let's call it $M$.\n6.  $M$ is a proper subcontinuum of $X$ which contains $K$, and it cannot be contained in any larger proper subcontinuum of $X$.\n7.  Since $M$ is a proper subcontinuum, there must be a point $y \\in X \\setminus M$. Let's pick any point $x \\in M$.\n8.  By our initial assumption (that $X$ has only one composant), there must be a proper subcontinuum, let's call it $A$, that contains both $x$ and $y$.\n9.  Now consider the union $M \\cup A$.\n    *   It is a continuum because $M$ and $A$ are continua and their intersection is non-empty (it contains $x$).\n    *   Since $X$ is indecomposable, and both $M$ and $A$ are proper subcontinua, their union $M \\cup A$ must also be a proper subcontinuum of $X$.\n    *   The set $M \\cup A$ contains $M$ and also contains the point $y$, which is not in $M$. Thus, $M$ is a proper subset of $M \\cup A$.\n10. This means we have found a proper subcontinuum ($M \\cup A$) that properly contains $M$. This contradicts the fact that $M$ is a maximal element in $\\mathcal{F}$.\n\nThe contradiction arose from the assumption that $X$ has only one composant. Therefore, **any indecomposable continuum must have at least two composants.**\n\n### Step 3: Distinguishing Between Metric and Non-Metric Continua\n\nThis is a crucial point. The properties of composants can differ significantly between metric and non-metric continua.\n\n*   **Metric Case:** For any indecomposable *metric* continuum, it is a famous theorem by Stefan Mazurkiewicz (1930) that the number of composants is always $\\mathfrak{c}$ (the cardinality of the continuum, i.e., the number of real numbers). The proof relies on the Baire Category Theorem and the fact that every composant in a metric indecomposable continuum is a meager set (a countable union of nowhere-dense sets). A space cannot be the countable union of meager sets, so the number of composants must be uncountable. A further argument shows the cardinality is exactly $\\mathfrak{c}$. If the question were restricted to metric continua, the answer would be $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n\n*   **Non-Metric Case:** The question explicitly allows for non-metric continua. In this general setting, the argument that a composant must be meager fails. A composant is a union of proper subcontinua (which are nowhere-dense), but this union is not necessarily countable, so the composant itself is not necessarily meager. This opens the possibility for a finite number of composants.\n\n### Step 4: Finding the Minimum Number\n\nFrom Step 2, we know the number of composants must be at least 2. The question now is whether an indecomposable continuum with exactly 2 composants can exist.\n\nThe answer is **yes**. The construction of such spaces is a non-trivial result in continuum theory.\n\n*   In 1967, Howard Cook published a paper (\"Continua with a finite number of composants\") where he constructed, for each integer $n \\ge 2$, an indecomposable (non-metric) continuum with exactly $n$ composants.\n*   David P. Bellamy also provided a well-known construction of an indecomposable continuum with exactly two composants in 1970.\n\nSince an indecomposable continuum must have at least 2 composants, and examples with exactly 2 composants exist, the smallest possible number is 2.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\n1.  An indecomposable continuum must have more than one composant. The minimum is at least 2.\n2.  For general (not necessarily metric) continua, examples have been constructed that have exactly 2 composants.\n3.  Therefore, the smallest number of composants an indecomposable continuum can have is 2.\n\n<<<2>>>"
