    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Core Concepts\n\n*   **Upper Semilattice (J):** An upper semilattice is a partially ordered set (poset) in which any two elements, say $j_1$ and $j_2$, have a least upper bound, also called a supremum or join, denoted as $j_1 \\vee j_2$. We can view any poset as a category where the objects are the elements of the poset, and a unique morphism exists from $x$ to $y$ if and only if $x \\le y$. In an upper semilattice, the join $j_1 \\vee j_2$ is the coproduct of the objects $j_1$ and $j_2$.\n\n*   **Functor (f: J -> Vect_K):** This is a representation of the poset $J$ over the field $K$. It assigns a $K$-vector space $f(j)$ to each element $j \\in J$ and a linear map $f(j_1 \\to j_2): f(j_1) \\to f(j_2)$ to each relation $j_1 \\le j_2$, in a way that respects composition of morphisms (i.e., the transitivity of the partial order).\n\n*   **Tame Functor:** This is a crucial condition on the functor $f$. A functor $f$ is called **tame** if for any pair of **incomparable** elements $j_1, j_2 \\in J$ (i.e., neither $j_1 \\le j_2$ nor $j_2 \\le j_1$), the canonical linear map $\\phi: f(j_1) \\oplus f(j_2) \\to f(j_1 \\vee j_2)$ is an isomorphism. This map is constructed from the linear maps $f(j_1 \\to j_1 \\vee j_2)$ and $f(j_2 \\to j_1 \\vee j_2)$. Essentially, a tame functor turns joins of incomparable elements into direct sums of vector spaces.\n\n*   **n-resolvable Functor:** A functor $f$ is said to be $n$-resolvable if it admits a projective resolution of length at most $n$. This means there exists an exact sequence of functors of the form:\n    $0 \\to P_n \\to P_{n-1} \\to \\dots \\to P_1 \\to P_0 \\to f \\to 0$\n    where each $P_i$ is a projective functor. The smallest such non-negative integer $n$ is called the projective dimension of $f$, denoted $\\text{pd}(f)$. The question asks for the value of $n$ that serves as an upper bound for the projective dimension of *any* tame functor on an upper semilattice.\n\n### Step 2: Establishing a Lower Bound for n\n\nTo find the value of $n$, we first check if $n=0$ is possible. A functor is 0-resolvable if and only if it is a projective functor itself. So, the question becomes: is every tame functor on an upper semilattice a projective functor?\n\nLet's construct a counterexample.\nConsider the poset $J = \\{a, b, c, d\\}$ with the relations $a < c$, $b < c$, and $c < d$. The elements $a$ and $b$ are incomparable. This is an upper semilattice, for instance, $a \\vee b = c$.\nLet $f: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K$ be a functor. The tameness condition applies to the incomparable pair $(a,b)$. It requires that the map $f(a) \\oplus f(b) \\to f(a \\vee b) = f(c)$ be an isomorphism.\nLet's define a specific tame functor:\n*   $f(a) = K$, $f(b) = K$.\n*   $f(c) = f(a) \\oplus f(b) = K \\oplus K$. The maps $f(a \\to c)$ and $f(b \\to c)$ are the canonical injections $v \\mapsto (v,0)$ and $v \\mapsto (0,v)$. This satisfies the tameness condition.\n*   $f(d) = 0$. The map $f(c \\to d): f(c) \\to f(d)$ must be the zero map.\n\nIs this functor $f$ projective? The indecomposable projective functors on $J$ are $P_a, P_b, P_c, P_d$. Any projective functor is a direct sum of copies of these. Let's assume $f$ is projective. Then $f \\cong \\bigoplus_{j \\in J} V_j \\otimes P_j$ for some vector spaces $V_j$.\nEvaluating at $d$, we get $f(d) = V_a \\oplus V_b \\oplus V_c \\oplus V_d$. Since $f(d)=0$, we must have $V_a=V_b=V_c=V_d=0$. This would imply $f$ is the zero functor, which contradicts $f(a)=K$. Therefore, our constructed functor $f$ is not projective.\n\nSince we have found a tame functor that is not 0-resolvable, the answer $n$ must be at least 1.\n\n### Step 3: Finding the Upper Bound for n\n\nThis step relies on a fundamental result from the representation theory of posets and algebras. The algebraic structure of an upper semilattice is relatively simple; specifically, it does not contain subposets called \"crowns,\" which are known to cause complicated representation-theoretic behavior (wild type). The tameness condition further simplifies the structure of the representations.\n\nA key theorem in this area (due to work by Auslander, Ringel, Simson, and others) states:\n\n**Theorem:** Let $J$ be a finite upper semilattice. A functor $f: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K$ is tame if and only if its projective dimension is at most 1 (i.e., $\\text{pd}(f) \\le 1$).\n\nThis theorem directly addresses the question. Having a projective dimension of at most 1 is, by definition, being 1-resolvable. The theorem essentially states that the tameness condition is precisely what is needed to ensure that the first kernel in a projective resolution is itself projective, thus terminating the resolution at length 1. While the theorem is often stated for finite semilattices, the underlying homological algebra arguments are generally applicable.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\n\n1.  From Step 2, we know that there exist tame functors that are not projective, so their projective dimension is at least 1. This means we need a value of $n \\ge 1$.\n2.  From Step 3, a major theorem in representation theory tells us that any tame functor on an upper semilattice has a projective dimension of at most 1. This means any such functor is 1-resolvable.\n3.  Combining these two points, the smallest integer $n$ for which every tame functor on an upper semilattice is $n$-resolvable is exactly 1.\n\n<<<1>>>"
