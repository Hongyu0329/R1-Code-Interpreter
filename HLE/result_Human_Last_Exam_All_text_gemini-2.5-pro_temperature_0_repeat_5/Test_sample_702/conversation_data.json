    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Spaces and the Map\n\n*   **Domain:** $A = \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$.\n    *   $\\Omega X$ is the loop space of $X$. $\\pi_i(\\Omega X) = \\pi_{i+1}(X)$.\n    *   $S^n$ is $(n-1)$-connected.\n    *   $\\Omega S^4$ is $(4-1-1)=2$-connected.\n    *   $\\Omega S^6$ is $(6-1-1)=4$-connected.\n    *   For CW complexes, if $X$ is $m$-connected and $Y$ is $n$-connected, their smash product $X \\wedge Y$ is $(m+n+1)$-connected.\n    *   Connectivity of $\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6$ is $2 + 4 + 1 = 7$. So it is 7-connected.\n    *   $\\Sigma X$ is the suspension of $X$. If $X$ is $k$-connected, $\\Sigma X$ is $(k+1)$-connected.\n    *   Connectivity of the domain $A = \\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$ is $7+1=8$. So, $\\pi_i(A) = 0$ for $i \\le 8$.\n\n*   **Codomain:** $B = \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$.\n    *   $S^4 \\wedge S^6 = S^{10}$.\n    *   The codomain is $B = \\Omega S^{10}$.\n    *   The connectivity of $\\Omega S^{10}$ is $(10-1-1)=8$. So, $\\pi_i(B) = 0$ for $i \\le 8$.\n\n*   **The Map:** $\\phi: \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$.\n    *   This map is a specific instance of a generalized Whitehead J-homomorphism, which can be constructed in several ways. One way is as the adjoint of the composition of the Samelson product and the evaluation map. Another is via a diagram of fibrations as described in the thought process. Regardless of the construction, its properties on low-dimensional homotopy groups are standard results in homotopy theory.\n\n### Step 2: Define and Determine the Connectivity of the Map\n\n*   **Definition of Connectivity:** A map $f: A \\to B$ is said to be $k$-connected if the induced map on homotopy groups, $f_*: \\pi_i(A) \\to \\pi_i(B)$, is an isomorphism for all $i < k$ and a surjection (epimorphism) for $i=k$. This is equivalent to the homotopy fiber of $f$ being $(k-1)$-connected.\n\n*   **Connectivity for $i \\le 8$:**\n    *   Both the domain $A$ and codomain $B$ are 8-connected.\n    *   This means for $i \\le 8$, $\\pi_i(A) = 0$ and $\\pi_i(B) = 0$.\n    *   The map $f_*: 0 \\to 0$ is trivially an isomorphism for $i \\le 8$.\n    *   According to the definition, this means the map is at least 8-connected. To find the precise connectivity, we must check higher homotopy groups.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Map on $\\pi_9$\n\n*   We need to analyze the map $\\phi_*: \\pi_9(A) \\to \\pi_9(B)$.\n*   **Homotopy group of the domain:**\n    *   By the Freudenthal Suspension Theorem, $\\pi_i(\\Sigma X) \\cong \\pi_{i-1}(X)$ for $i < 2 \\cdot \\text{conn}(X) + 2$.\n    *   Here $X = \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6$, which is 7-connected. The range of isomorphism is $i < 2(7)+2 = 16$.\n    *   So, $\\pi_9(A) = \\pi_9(\\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)) \\cong \\pi_8(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$.\n    *   Since $\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6$ is 7-connected, the Hurewicz Theorem applies, and $\\pi_8(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\cong H_8(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$.\n    *   By the KÃ¼nneth formula for smash products, the lowest degree non-trivial homology group is $H_{3+5}(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) = H_3(\\Omega S^4) \\otimes H_5(\\Omega S^6)$.\n    *   $H_3(\\Omega S^4) \\cong \\pi_3(\\Omega S^4) = \\pi_4(S^4) = \\mathbb{Z}$.\n    *   $H_5(\\Omega S^6) \\cong \\pi_5(\\Omega S^6) = \\pi_6(S^6) = \\mathbb{Z}$.\n    *   Thus, $H_8(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$ contains a $\\mathbb{Z} \\otimes \\mathbb{Z} = \\mathbb{Z}$ summand and is in fact isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}$.\n    *   So, $\\pi_9(A) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n*   **Homotopy group of the codomain:**\n    *   $\\pi_9(B) = \\pi_9(\\Omega S^{10}) = \\pi_{10}(S^{10}) = \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n*   **The map on $\\pi_9$:**\n    *   The map $\\phi_*: \\pi_9(A) \\to \\pi_9(B)$ is a homomorphism $\\mathbb{Z} \\to \\mathbb{Z}$.\n    *   A key result in homotopy theory (related to the work of Whitehead, James, and Samelson) states that this map is an isomorphism. It essentially relates the Samelson product of loops to the Whitehead product of spheres. The generator of $\\pi_9(A)$ is mapped to a generator of $\\pi_9(B)$.\n    *   Since $\\phi_*$ is an isomorphism on $\\pi_9$, the map $\\phi$ is an isomorphism for $i < 10$.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the Map on $\\pi_{10}$ and Conclude\n\n*   Since $\\phi_*$ is an isomorphism for all $i < 10$, the map is at least 9-connected.\n*   To determine if it is 10-connected, we must check if $\\phi_*: \\pi_{10}(A) \\to \\pi_{10}(B)$ is a surjection.\n*   **Homotopy group of the domain:** $\\pi_{10}(A) \\cong \\pi_9(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$. This is a complicated group, but it is known to be non-trivial.\n*   **Homotopy group of the codomain:** $\\pi_{10}(B) = \\pi_{10}(\\Omega S^{10}) = \\pi_{11}(S^{10}) = \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n*   The map $\\phi_*: \\pi_{10}(A) \\to \\pi_{10}(B)$ is known to be non-surjective (in fact, it is often the zero map in such cases). The reasoning is deep and relates to higher order Whitehead products and Toda brackets.\n*   Since $\\phi_*$ is not surjective on $\\pi_{10}$, the map is not 10-connected.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\n*   The map $\\phi_*$ is an isomorphism for $i < 10$.\n*   The map $\\phi_*$ is not a surjection for $i=10$.\n*   By the definition of connectivity, the map is 9-connected."
