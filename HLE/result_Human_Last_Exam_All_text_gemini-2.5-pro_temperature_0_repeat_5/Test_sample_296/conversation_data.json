    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of subgroups of index 4 in the Grigorchuk group.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Problem and the Grigorchuk Group (G)\n\nThe question asks for the total number of subgroups of index 4 in the Grigorchuk group, denoted by `G`. To answer this, we need to leverage the specific structural properties of `G`.\n\n**Key Properties of the Grigorchuk Group:**\n1.  **Self-Similarity and Branch Structure:** The Grigorchuk group `G` acts on an infinite binary rooted tree. This action endows it with a self-similar structure. A crucial consequence of this is that `G` is a **regular branch group** over the cyclic group `C_2`. This property is fundamental for understanding its subgroup structure.\n2.  **Abelianization:** The abelianization of `G`, which is the quotient group `G/[G,G]` (where `[G,G]` is the commutator subgroup), is known to be isomorphic to the direct product of three cyclic groups of order 2.\n    `G/[G,G] ≅ C_2 × C_2 × C_2 ≅ (C_2)^3`.\n3.  **Torsion Group:** `G` is an infinite 2-group, meaning every element has an order that is a power of 2.\n\n### Step 2: Use the Subgroup Growth Formula for Branch Groups\n\nFor regular branch groups, there is a powerful recurrence relation that describes the number of subgroups of a given index. Let `s_n(K)` denote the number of subgroups of index `n` in a group `K`.\n\n*   **Theorem:** For a regular branch group `G` over `C_m`, the number of subgroups follows the relation `s_{mn}(G) = s_n(G^m)`.\n\nThe Grigorchuk group `G` is a regular branch group over `C_2`, so we have `m=2`. The formula becomes:\n`s_{2n}(G) = s_n(G × G)`\n\nWe want to find `s_4(G)`, the number of subgroups of index 4. We can set `n=2` in the formula:\n`s_{2×2}(G) = s_2(G × G)`\n`s_4(G) = s_2(G × G)`\n\nThis simplifies the problem significantly: finding the number of subgroups of index 4 in `G` is equivalent to finding the number of subgroups of index 2 in the direct product group `G × G`.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Number of Subgroups of Index 2 in G × G\n\nA subgroup of index 2 in any group is always a normal subgroup. There is a one-to-one correspondence between subgroups of index 2 and surjective homomorphisms from the group to the cyclic group of order 2, `C_2`.\n\nSo, `s_2(G × G)` is equal to the number of surjective homomorphisms `φ: G × G → C_2`.\n\n1.  **Find the number of all homomorphisms `Hom(G × G, C_2)`:**\n    The group `C_2` is abelian, so any homomorphism to it factors through the abelianization of the domain.\n    `Hom(G × G, C_2) ≅ Hom((G × G)/[G × G, G × G], C_2)`\n\n    The commutator subgroup of a direct product is the direct product of the commutator subgroups:\n    `[G × G, G × G] = [G,G] × [G,G]`\n\n    So, the abelianization of `G × G` is:\n    `(G × G)/([G,G] × [G,G]) ≅ (G/[G,G]) × (G/[G,G])`\n\n    Using the known abelianization of `G` (`G/[G,G] ≅ (C_2)^3`), we get:\n    `(G × G)/[G × G, G × G] ≅ (C_2)^3 × (C_2)^3 ≅ (C_2)^6`\n\n    Therefore, we need to count the homomorphisms from `(C_2)^6` to `C_2`:\n    `Hom(G × G, C_2) ≅ Hom((C_2)^6, C_2)`\n\n    A homomorphism from `(C_2)^6` to `C_2` is determined by where it sends the 6 generators. Each generator can be mapped to either of the 2 elements in `C_2`. Thus, the total number of homomorphisms is `2^6 = 64`.\n\n2.  **Find the number of surjective homomorphisms:**\n    A homomorphism `φ: K → C_2` is surjective if and only if it is not the trivial homomorphism (the one that maps every element to the identity).\n    Out of the 64 total homomorphisms from `G × G` to `C_2`, exactly one is the trivial homomorphism.\n    Number of surjective homomorphisms = Total homomorphisms - 1 = `64 - 1 = 63`.\n\n3.  **Conclusion for `s_2(G × G)`:**\n    Since each surjective homomorphism corresponds to a unique subgroup of index 2, the number of subgroups of index 2 in `G × G` is 63.\n    `s_2(G × G) = 63`.\n\n### Step 4: Final Answer\n\nFrom Step 2, we established that `s_4(G) = s_2(G × G)`.\nFrom Step 3, we calculated `s_2(G × G) = 63`.\n\nTherefore, the number of subgroups of index 4 in the Grigorchuk group is 63.\n\n### Careful Points Checklist:\n*   The solution relies on the deep structural property that `G` is a regular branch group. A direct enumeration of homomorphisms to `S_4` would be extremely difficult.\n*   The distinction between all subgroups and only normal subgroups is important. The formula `s_{2n}(G) = s_n(G × G)` correctly counts all subgroups, not just the normal ones. (For reference, there are 7 normal subgroups of index 4, and thus `63 - 7 = 56` non-normal ones).\n*   The calculation of `Hom(G, C_2)` requires knowing the abelianization `G/[G,G]`.\n*   The final count of surjective homomorphisms is `|Hom| - 1` only when the target group is `C_2`.\n\nThe step-by-step analysis confirms the result.\n\n<<<63>>>"
