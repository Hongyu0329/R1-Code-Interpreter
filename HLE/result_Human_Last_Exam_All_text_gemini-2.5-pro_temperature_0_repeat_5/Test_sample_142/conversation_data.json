    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of Configuration State Functions (CSFs) for a full Configuration Interaction (CI) calculation of the molecule $\\mathrm{CH}_2 \\mathrm{SiHF}$ using the 6-31G** basis set.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the total number of electrons (N)\nFirst, we identify the atoms in the molecule and sum their electrons.\n-   Carbon (C): 1 atom, 6 electrons/atom = 6 electrons\n-   Hydrogen (H): 3 atoms, 1 electron/atom = 3 electrons\n-   Silicon (Si): 1 atom, 14 electrons/atom = 14 electrons\n-   Fluorine (F): 1 atom, 9 electrons/atom = 9 electrons\n\nTotal number of electrons, N = 6 + 3 + 14 + 9 = 32.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the total number of basis functions (K)\nNext, we determine the number of basis functions contributed by each atom for the 6-31G** basis set.\n\n-   **6-31G**: This describes the core and valence shells. It's a split-valence basis set.\n-   **\\*\\***: This indicates polarization functions. The first `*` adds d-functions to heavy (non-hydrogen) atoms, and the second `*` adds p-functions to hydrogen atoms. We will assume the use of 6 Cartesian d-functions, which is common.\n\nLet's count the functions for each atom type:\n\n-   **Hydrogen (H)**:\n    -   The 1s orbital is described by a split-valence set (inner and outer), giving 2 basis functions.\n    -   The second `*` adds a set of p-type polarization functions (p_x, p_y, p_z), which is 3 functions.\n    -   Total for one H atom = 2 + 3 = 5 basis functions.\n    -   For 3 H atoms, the total is 3 * 5 = 15 basis functions.\n\n-   **Carbon (C)** (a 2nd-period heavy atom):\n    -   The 6-31G part gives 1 function for the 1s core and 2 sets of functions (inner and outer) for the 2s and 2p valence orbitals. Each valence set has one s-type and three p-type functions. So, 1 (core) + 4 (inner valence) + 4 (outer valence) = 9 basis functions.\n    -   The first `*` adds a set of d-type polarization functions, which is 6 functions.\n    -   Total for C atom = 9 + 6 = 15 basis functions.\n\n-   **Fluorine (F)** (a 2nd-period heavy atom):\n    -   The counting is identical to Carbon.\n    -   Total for F atom = 9 + 6 = 15 basis functions.\n\n-   **Silicon (Si)** (a 3rd-period heavy atom):\n    -   The 6-31G part gives functions for the 1s, 2s, 2p core orbitals (1 s-type + 1 s-type + 3 p-type = 5 functions) and 2 sets of functions for the 3s and 3p valence orbitals (2 * 4 = 8 functions). So, 5 (core) + 8 (valence) = 13 basis functions.\n    -   The first `*` adds a set of d-type polarization functions, which is 6 functions.\n    -   Total for Si atom = 13 + 6 = 19 basis functions.\n\nNow, we sum the basis functions for all atoms in the molecule:\nTotal number of basis functions, K = (functions for C) + (functions for 3H) + (functions for Si) + (functions for F)\nK = 15 + 15 + 19 + 15 = 64.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the number of CSFs\nFor a full CI calculation, the number of CSFs for a system with K spatial orbitals, N electrons, and a total spin S is given by the Weyl formula. Since $\\mathrm{CH}_2 \\mathrm{SiHF}$ has an even number of electrons (N=32), its ground state is a singlet state, so S=0.\n\nThe Weyl formula for a singlet state (S=0) is:\n$N_{CSF}(S=0) = \\frac{1}{K+1} \\binom{K+1}{N/2} \\binom{K+1}{N/2 + 1}$\n\nWe substitute our calculated values:\n-   K = 64\n-   N = 32\n-   N/2 = 16\n\n$N_{CSF} = \\frac{1}{64+1} \\binom{64+1}{16} \\binom{64+1}{16 + 1}$\n$N_{CSF} = \\frac{1}{65} \\binom{65}{16} \\binom{65}{17}$\n\n### Step 4: Perform the calculation\nNow we compute the values of the binomial coefficients and the final result.\n\n-   $\\binom{65}{16} = \\frac{65!}{16! \\cdot (65-16)!} = 72,284,476,868,414,044$\n-   $\\binom{65}{17} = \\frac{65!}{17! \\cdot (65-17)!} = 20,484,345,082,933,440$\n\nNow, multiply these two large numbers and divide by 65:\n$N_{CSF} = \\frac{72,284,476,868,414,044 \\times 20,484,345,082,933,440}{65}$\n$N_{CSF} = \\frac{1,480,690,131,388,383,538,998,803,334,1440}{65}$\n$N_{CSF} = 22,779,848,175,205,900,599,981,589,7560$\n\nThis is the total number of singlet configuration state functions for the full CI calculation.\n\n***\n**Careful Points:**\n1.  **Correct Electron Count:** Ensure all electrons from all atoms are counted.\n2.  **Correct Basis Function Count:** The definition of the basis set (6-31G**) must be interpreted correctly for each type of atom (H, 2nd period, 3rd period). The number of polarization functions (p on H, d on heavy atoms) and whether they are Cartesian (6d) or spherical (5d) is a key detail. The standard is Cartesian.\n3.  **Correct Formula:** The Weyl formula is the standard for calculating the number of CSFs. There are other equivalent formulas (like the genealogical formula), but they should yield the same result.\n4.  **Correct State:** The calculation is for a singlet state (S=0), which is the ground state for this molecule.\n5.  **Large Number Arithmetic:** The calculation involves extremely large numbers, requiring a calculator or software capable of arbitrary-precision integer arithmetic to avoid overflow and rounding errors.\n\n<<<227798481752059005999815897560>>>"
