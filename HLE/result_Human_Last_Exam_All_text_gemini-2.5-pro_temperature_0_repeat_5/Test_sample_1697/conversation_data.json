    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction to determine the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Starting Material**\nThe starting material is N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide. Let's break down its structure:\n*   **Benzamide:** A benzene ring attached to a carboxamide group, -C(=O)N-.\n*   **N,N-diethyl:** Two ethyl groups (-CH2CH3) are attached to the nitrogen atom of the amide, giving -C(=O)N(CH2CH3)2. This group is at position 1 of the benzene ring.\n*   **3-dimethylamino:** A dimethylamino group [-N(CH3)2] is attached to position 3 of the benzene ring.\n\nThe structure has two key functional groups on the benzene ring: the N,N-diethylcarboxamide group at C1 and the dimethylamino group at C3.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the First Reaction Step (Reagents: sec-BuLi and TMEDA in THF)**\n*   **sec-BuLi (sec-butyllithium):** This is a very strong organolithium base. Its primary role in this context is to remove an acidic proton (deprotonation).\n*   **TMEDA (N,N,N',N'-tetramethylethylenediamine):** This is a bidentate chelating ligand. It coordinates strongly with the lithium cation (Li+), breaking up the oligomeric aggregates of sec-BuLi. This makes the sec-butyl anion more reactive (a \"superbase\") and helps to direct the deprotonation.\n*   **Reaction Type:** This set of reagents is characteristic of a **Directed Ortho Metalation (DoM)** reaction. In a DoM reaction, a functional group on the aromatic ring (a Directing Metalation Group, DMG) coordinates to the lithium ion, directing the base to deprotonate a C-H bond at a position *ortho* (adjacent) to it.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Site of Lithiation (Deprotonation)**\nWe need to determine which proton on the benzene ring is the most acidic and most likely to be removed. This is determined by the directing ability of the functional groups present.\n*   **N,N-diethylcarboxamide group (-CONEt2) at C1:** This is a very powerful directing group. The carbonyl oxygen is an excellent Lewis base that coordinates strongly with the Li+ ion. It directs deprotonation to its ortho positions, which are C2 and C6.\n*   **Dimethylamino group (-NMe2) at C3:** This is also a directing group, but it is significantly weaker than the amide group. The nitrogen lone pair can coordinate with Li+, directing deprotonation to its ortho positions, which are C2 and C4.\n\n**Careful Point:** The relative strength of directing groups is crucial. The established order is -CONR2 >> -NR2. Therefore, the -CONEt2 group will primarily control the position of the reaction.\n\n*   **Predicting the site:**\n    *   The strongest directing group (-CONEt2 at C1) directs to C2 and C6.\n    *   The weaker directing group (-NMe2 at C3) directs to C2 and C4.\n    *   The C2 position is ortho to *both* directing groups. This is a synergistic effect, making the proton at C2 exceptionally acidic and sterically accessible for deprotonation. The lithiation will occur selectively at this position.\n\nThe product of the first step is an aryllithium intermediate, where the hydrogen at C2 has been replaced by lithium.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Second Reaction Step (Reagent: Methyl Iodide, CH3I)**\n*   **Aryllithium Intermediate:** The intermediate formed in Step 3 has a carbanion at C2, making it a strong nucleophile.\n*   **Methyl Iodide (CH3I):** This is an electrophile. The carbon atom of the methyl group is electron-deficient and susceptible to nucleophilic attack.\n*   **Reaction Type:** The nucleophilic carbanion at C2 will attack the electrophilic methyl group of CH3I in an SN2 reaction, displacing the iodide ion (I-).\n\n**Step 5: Determine the Final Product**\nThis reaction results in the formation of a new carbon-carbon bond between C2 of the benzene ring and the methyl group.\n*   The N,N-diethylcarboxamide group remains at C1.\n*   The dimethylamino group remains at C3.\n*   A new methyl group (-CH3) is attached to C2.\n\nThe final compound is therefore **N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide**.\n\n<<<N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide>>>"
