    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the central pixel of the line using Bresenham's algorithm.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Define the Line and Calculate Deltas**\n\n*   Start point (x1, y1) = (1, 1)\n*   End point (x2, y2) = (11, 5)\n*   Calculate the change in x (dx) and y (dy):\n    *   `dx = x2 - x1 = 11 - 1 = 10`\n    *   `dy = y2 - y1 = 5 - 1 = 4`\n\n**Careful Point:** We observe that `dx > dy` and both are positive. This means the slope of the line is between 0 and 1. In Bresenham's algorithm for this case, we will always increment `x` by 1 in each step and decide whether to increment `y`.\n\n**Step 2: Initialize Bresenham's Algorithm**\n\n*   The first pixel to be plotted is the starting point: **(1, 1)**.\n*   Calculate the initial decision parameter, `p`:\n    *   `p = 2 * dy - dx`\n    *   `p = 2 * 4 - 10 = 8 - 10 = -2`\n*   We also need two constants for updating `p` in each iteration:\n    *   If `p < 0`, we use: `2 * dy = 2 * 4 = 8`\n    *   If `p >= 0`, we use: `2 * dy - 2 * dx = 8 - 20 = -12`\n\n**Step 3: Iterate and Generate All Pixels**\n\nWe will iterate `dx` (10) times to find the subsequent pixels.\n\n*   **Initial State:** Pixel = (1, 1), p = -2\n\n*   **Iteration 1:**\n    *   `p = -2` which is less than 0.\n    *   The next pixel is (x+1, y) -> (1+1, 1) = **(2, 1)**.\n    *   Update `p`: `p = p + 2*dy = -2 + 8 = 6`.\n\n*   **Iteration 2:**\n    *   `p = 6` which is greater than or equal to 0.\n    *   The next pixel is (x+1, y+1) -> (2+1, 1+1) = **(3, 2)**.\n    *   Update `p`: `p = p + (2*dy - 2*dx) = 6 - 12 = -6`.\n\n*   **Iteration 3:**\n    *   `p = -6` which is less than 0.\n    *   The next pixel is (x+1, y) -> (3+1, 2) = **(4, 2)**.\n    *   Update `p`: `p = p + 2*dy = -6 + 8 = 2`.\n\n*   **Iteration 4:**\n    *   `p = 2` which is greater than or equal to 0.\n    *   The next pixel is (x+1, y+1) -> (4+1, 2+1) = **(5, 3)**.\n    *   Update `p`: `p = p + (2*dy - 2*dx) = 2 - 12 = -10`.\n\n*   **Iteration 5:**\n    *   `p = -10` which is less than 0.\n    *   The next pixel is (x+1, y) -> (5+1, 3) = **(6, 3)**.\n    *   Update `p`: `p = p + 2*dy = -10 + 8 = -2`.\n\n*   **Iteration 6:**\n    *   `p = -2` which is less than 0.\n    *   The next pixel is (x+1, y) -> (6+1, 3) = **(7, 3)**.\n    *   Update `p`: `p = p + 2*dy = -2 + 8 = 6`.\n\n*   **Iteration 7:**\n    *   `p = 6` which is greater than or equal to 0.\n    *   The next pixel is (x+1, y+1) -> (7+1, 3+1) = **(8, 4)**.\n    *   Update `p`: `p = p + (2*dy - 2*dx) = 6 - 12 = -6`.\n\n*   **Iteration 8:**\n    *   `p = -6` which is less than 0.\n    *   The next pixel is (x+1, y) -> (8+1, 4) = **(9, 4)**.\n    *   Update `p`: `p = p + 2*dy = -6 + 8 = 2`.\n\n*   **Iteration 9:**\n    *   `p = 2` which is greater than or equal to 0.\n    *   The next pixel is (x+1, y+1) -> (9+1, 4+1) = **(10, 5)**.\n    *   Update `p`: `p = p + (2*dy - 2*dx) = 2 - 12 = -10`.\n\n*   **Iteration 10:**\n    *   `p = -10` which is less than 0.\n    *   The next pixel is (x+1, y) -> (10+1, 5) = **(11, 5)**. This is our endpoint.\n\n**Step 4: List All Pixels and Find the Center**\n\nThe complete list of pixels generated by the algorithm is:\n(1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 2), (4, 2), (5, 3), **(6, 3)**, (7, 3), (8, 4), (9, 4), (10, 5), (11, 5)\n\n*   **Careful Point:** The total number of pixels is `dx + 1 = 10 + 1 = 11`.\n*   Since there are 11 pixels (an odd number), the central pixel is the `(11 + 1) / 2 = 6th` pixel in the sequence.\n*   Counting through our list, the 6th pixel is (6, 3).\n\n**Alternative Method (Sanity Check)**\n\nThe geometric midpoint of a line segment is `((x1+x2)/2, (y1+y2)/2)`.\n*   Midpoint x = (1 + 11) / 2 = 6\n*   Midpoint y = (1 + 5) / 2 = 3\nThe geometric midpoint is (6, 3). Since the midpoint has integer coordinates, it must be one of the pixels on the line and is, by definition, the central pixel. This confirms our result from the algorithm trace.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe central pixel is the 6th pixel in the sequence of 11 pixels.\n\nCoordinates of the central pixel: **(6, 3)**\n\n<<<(6, 3)>>>"
