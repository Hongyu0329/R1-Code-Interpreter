    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the probability of finding the particle in the specified interval.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the System and State**\n*   **System:** A particle confined to a one-dimensional (1D) box. The box has a length 'a' and extends from x = 0 to x = a.\n*   **State:** The particle is in the second energy eigenstate, which corresponds to the principal quantum number n = 2.\n\n**2. Write Down the Wavefunction**\nThe normalized wavefunction for a particle in a 1D box is given by:\n   ψ_n(x) = √(2/a) * sin(nπx / a)\nFor the n = 2 state, the wavefunction is:\n   ψ_2(x) = √(2/a) * sin(2πx / a)\n\n**3. Determine the Probability Density**\nThe probability of finding the particle at a specific position x is given by the probability density, P(x), which is the square of the magnitude of the wavefunction:\n   P(x) = |ψ_2(x)|² = [√(2/a) * sin(2πx / a)]²\n   P(x) = (2/a) * sin²(2πx / a)\n\n**4. Set Up the Probability Integral**\nThe probability of finding the particle in an interval from x₁ to x₂ is the integral of the probability density over that interval:\n   Prob(x₁ ≤ x ≤ x₂) = ∫[from x₁ to x₂] P(x) dx\nIn this problem, the interval is from x₁ = 0.495a to x₂ = 0.505a.\n   Prob = ∫[from 0.495a to 0.505a] (2/a) * sin²(2πx / a) dx\n\n**5. Analyze the Interval and Choose an Approach**\n*   **Careful Point 1:** The interval is Δx = 0.505a - 0.495a = 0.01a. This is a very small interval.\n*   **Careful Point 2:** The interval is centered at x = (0.495a + 0.505a) / 2 = 0.5a = a/2.\n*   **Careful Point 3:** For the n=2 state, the wavefunction has a node at the center of the box, x = a/2. This means ψ₂(a/2) = 0 and the probability density P(a/2) = 0. A simple approximation like `Prob ≈ P(center) * Δx` would yield an incorrect result of 0. We must perform the integration.\n\n**6. Perform the Integration**\nTo solve the integral, we use the trigonometric identity: sin²(θ) = (1 - cos(2θ)) / 2.\nLet θ = 2πx / a. Then 2θ = 4πx / a.\n   P(x) = (2/a) * [1 - cos(4πx / a)] / 2 = (1/a) * [1 - cos(4πx / a)]\nNow, we integrate this expression:\n   Prob = ∫[from 0.495a to 0.505a] (1/a) * [1 - cos(4πx / a)] dx\n   Prob = (1/a) * [ ∫[from 0.495a to 0.505a] 1 dx - ∫[from 0.495a to 0.505a] cos(4πx / a) dx ]\nThe integral of the cosine term is: ∫cos(kx)dx = (1/k)sin(kx). Here, k = 4π/a.\n   Prob = (1/a) * [ x - (a / 4π) * sin(4πx / a) ] evaluated from 0.495a to 0.505a.\n\n**7. Evaluate the Integral at the Limits**\n   Prob = (1/a) * { [0.505a - (a/4π)sin(4π(0.505a)/a)] - [0.495a - (a/4π)sin(4π(0.495a)/a)] }\n   Prob = (1/a) * { (0.505a - 0.495a) - (a/4π) * [sin(2.02π) - sin(1.98π)] }\n   Prob = 0.01 - (1/4π) * [sin(2.02π) - sin(1.98π)]\n\n**8. Simplify the Trigonometric Terms**\nUsing the identities sin(2π + θ) = sin(θ) and sin(2π - θ) = -sin(θ):\n*   sin(2.02π) = sin(2π + 0.02π) = sin(0.02π)\n*   sin(1.98π) = sin(2π - 0.02π) = -sin(0.02π)\nSubstitute these back into the expression for probability:\n   Prob = 0.01 - (1/4π) * [sin(0.02π) - (-sin(0.02π))]\n   Prob = 0.01 - (1/4π) * [2 * sin(0.02π)]\n   Prob = 0.01 - (1/2π) * sin(0.02π)\n\n**9. Calculate the Final Numerical Value**\n*   **Careful Point 4:** The argument of the sine function, 0.02π, is a small angle. We can use the Taylor series expansion for sin(u) where u is small: sin(u) ≈ u - u³/6. Using only sin(u) ≈ u would lead to an incorrect result of 0.\nLet u = 0.02π.\n   Prob ≈ 0.01 - (1/2π) * [ (0.02π) - (0.02π)³/6 ]\n   Prob ≈ 0.01 - [ (1/2π)(0.02π) - (1/2π)(0.02π)³/6 ]\n   Prob ≈ 0.01 - [ 0.01 - (1/12π)(0.02π)³ ]\n   Prob ≈ (1/12π) * (0.02π)³\n   Prob ≈ (1/12π) * (0.000008 * π³)\n   Prob ≈ (0.000008 * π²) / 12\n   Prob ≈ (2/3) * 10⁻⁶ * π²\nUsing π ≈ 3.14159, so π² ≈ 9.8696:\n   Prob ≈ (2/3) * 10⁻⁶ * 9.8696\n   Prob ≈ 6.5797 * 10⁻⁶\n\nThis result can be confirmed by approximating the integrand P(x) with its Taylor series around x=a/2 before integrating, which yields the same result.\n\nThe probability is approximately 6.58 x 10⁻⁶.\n\n<<<6.58e-6>>>"
