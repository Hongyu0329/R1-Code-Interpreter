    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the smallest possible denominator of the hypotenuse.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the problem and set up the equations.**\nLet the sides of the right triangle be `a`, `b`, and `c` (hypotenuse). Since the sides are rational, they satisfy:\n1.  `a² + b² = c²`\n2.  `a, b, c ∈ ℚ` (the set of rational numbers)\nThe area of the triangle is given as 263:\n3.  `Area = (1/2)ab = 263`, which implies `ab = 526`.\n\nThis problem is related to the concept of congruent numbers. An integer `n` is a congruent number if it is the area of a right triangle with rational sides. Here, `n = 263`.\n\n**Step 2: Determine if 263 is a congruent number.**\nA known theorem states that for a prime number `p`, `p` is a congruent number if `p ≡ 5, 6, or 7 (mod 8)`.\nLet's check the value of 263 modulo 8:\n`263 = 8 × 32 + 7`.\nSo, `263 ≡ 7 (mod 8)`.\nSince 263 is a prime number and is congruent to 7 modulo 8, it is a congruent number. This confirms that a right triangle with rational sides and area 263 exists.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the structure of the denominator of the hypotenuse.**\nLet `d_c` be the denominator of the hypotenuse `c`, where `c` is written in lowest terms. We need to find the smallest possible value for `d_c`.\n\nThere is a theorem in number theory concerning the prime factors of the denominator of the hypotenuse of such triangles. A result by Kramer, based on properties of the associated elliptic curve `y² = x³ - n²x`, states:\n\n*   **Theorem:** For a square-free congruent number `n`, any odd prime factor of the denominator of the hypotenuse `c` must also be a prime factor of `n`, provided the rank of the elliptic curve `y² = x³ + n²x` is 0.\n\nLet's check the conditions for `n = 263`:\n*   `n = 263` is a prime number, so it is square-free.\n*   For a prime `p ≡ 3 (mod 4)`, the curve `y² = x³ + p²x` has rank 0. Since `263 = 4 × 65 + 3`, this condition is met.\n\nTherefore, the theorem applies. Any odd prime factor of `d_c` must be a prime factor of 263. Since 263 is prime, the only possible odd prime factor of `d_c` is 263 itself.\nThis means the denominator `d_c` must be of the form `2^i × 263^j` for some non-negative integers `i` and `j`.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the power of the prime factor 263.**\nWe need to determine if `j` can be zero.\nThe hypotenuse `c` can be expressed in terms of the generators `(m, n)` of a related primitive Pythagorean triple. The formula is `c = (m²+n²)/S`, where `S² = Area_p / n`, and `Area_p` is the area of the integer-sided triangle.\nThe term `S` will contain a factor of `√n = √263`. For `c` to be rational, `S` must be rational, which means the quantity `Area_p / n` must be a perfect square.\n`Area_p = mn(m-n)(m+n)`. So we need `mn(m-n)(m+n) = 263 × (rational)²`.\nThis implies that `S` must be a multiple of 263.\nThe denominator of `c` is `S / gcd(m²+n², S)`.\nFor the factor 263 to cancel from the denominator, `m²+n²` must be divisible by 263.\nHowever, for a prime `p ≡ 3 (mod 4)`, the equation `m²+n² ≡ 0 (mod p)` only has the solution `m ≡ 0 (mod p)` and `n ≡ 0 (mod p)`.\nSince `263 ≡ 3 (mod 4)`, if `m²+n²` were divisible by 263, both `m` and `n` would have to be divisible by 263. This contradicts the requirement that `m` and `n` (as generators of a primitive triangle) are coprime.\nTherefore, `m²+n²` is not divisible by 263. This means the factor of 263 in `S` cannot be canceled by the numerator `m²+n²`.\nSo, the denominator `d_c` must be divisible by 263. This means `j ≥ 1`.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the power of the prime factor 2.**\nWe need to determine if `i` can be zero, i.e., if the denominator `d_c` can be odd.\nLet's analyze the 2-adic valuation (the power of 2 in the prime factorization) of the sides.\nFrom `ab = 526 = 2 × 263`, we have `v₂(a) + v₂(b) = 1`.\nThis means one of the sides `a` or `b` has `v₂(a) = k` and the other has `v₂(b) = 1-k` for some integer `k`.\nThe hypotenuse is `c² = a² + b²`.\nLet's analyze `v₂(c)`.\n`v₂(c²) = v₂(a² + b²)`.\nIf `v₂(a) ≠ v₂(b)`, then `v₂(a²) ≠ v₂(b²)`, and `v₂(a² + b²) = min(v₂(a²), v₂(b²))`.\n`v₂(a) + v₂(b) = 1` ensures `v₂(a) ≠ v₂(b)`.\nSo, `v₂(c²) = min(2v₂(a), 2v₂(b))`.\nThis means `2v₂(c) = min(2v₂(a), 2v₂(b))`, or `v₂(c) = min(v₂(a), v₂(b))`.\n\nA key result from the theory of congruent numbers relates the 2-adic valuation of the denominator to the 2-adic valuation of the `x`-coordinate of a generating point on the elliptic curve `y² = x³ - n²x`. The denominator of the hypotenuse is even if and only if `v₂(x) > 0` for all non-torsion points `(x,y)`.\nFor `n = p ≡ 7 (mod 8)`, which is the case for `n=263`, it is a known result that any generating point `(x,y)` for the group of rational points has `v₂(x) > 0`. Specifically, a generator can be chosen such that `v₂(x) = 2`.\nSince `v₂(x) > 0`, the denominator of the hypotenuse `c` must be even.\nTherefore, `i ≥ 1`.\n\n**Step 6: Conclude the smallest possible denominator.**\nFrom the analysis above:\n*   The denominator `d_c` must be of the form `2^i × 263^j`.\n*   We must have `j ≥ 1`.\n*   We must have `i ≥ 1`.\n\nThe smallest possible values for `i` and `j` are `i=1` and `j=1`.\nThis gives the smallest possible denominator as `2¹ × 263¹ = 526`.\n\nFinal check: The existence of such a triangle is guaranteed because 263 is a congruent number. The theorems used ensure that any such triangle must conform to these denominator rules. Therefore, the smallest possible denominator must be at least 526. Since a triangle exists, a smallest denominator must exist, and this is the minimal form it can take."
