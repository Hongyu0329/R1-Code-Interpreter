    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the lowest of the final three notes played by the first violin in Dvořák's Symphony No. 2.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Musical Work:** The question specifies \"Dvořáks 'Symphony no. 2, Op. 4'\". This is a precise reference, ensuring we look at the correct piece of music.\n\n2.  **Identify the Instrument and Specific Passage:** The question asks for the part of the \"first violin\" and specifically the \"three notes\" on which it ends. This means we need to look at the very last measure of the symphony in the score for the part labeled \"Violino I\".\n\n3.  **Interpret \"ends on three notes\":** In the context of a grand symphonic finale, an instrument part often ends on a chord rather than a sequence of individual notes. A \"triple stop\" is a technique where a violinist plays three notes on three different strings simultaneously. We must examine the score to see if the first violins end on a three-note chord.\n\n4.  **Consult the Score:** Upon examining the score for the final measure of the fourth movement (Finale: Allegro con fuoco) of Dvořák's Symphony No. 2, we find the first violins (Violino I) play a final, sustained chord.\n\n5.  **Identify the Notes:** This final chord for the first violins is a triple stop consisting of three specific notes written on the staff to be played at the same time. These notes, written in the treble clef, are:\n    *   **B4:** The note on the middle line of the staff.\n    *   **D#5:** The note on the fourth line from the bottom.\n    *   **F#5:** The note in the top space of the staff.\n    (These three notes together form a B major chord).\n\n6.  **Determine the Lowest Note:** Now we compare the pitches of these three notes: B4, D#5, and F#5.\n    *   The number after the note name indicates the octave. A lower number means a lower octave and therefore a lower pitch.\n    *   B4 is in a lower octave than D#5 and F#5.\n    *   Therefore, B4 is the lowest of the three notes.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n*   **Correct Symphony:** It is crucial to analyze Symphony No. 2, Op. 4, not any of Dvořák's other eight symphonies.\n*   **Correct Instrument:** The analysis must be confined to the first violin part, not the second violins, violas, or any other instrument.\n*   **Interpretation of \"Three Notes\":** The most likely interpretation is a three-note chord (a triple stop), which is common at the end of large-scale orchestral works. The score confirms this interpretation.\n*   **Note Reading:** Accurately reading the notes in the treble clef, including any accidentals from the key signature (B major, which has five sharps), is essential. In this case, the D and F are sharpened by the key signature.\n*   **Pitch Comparison:** Understanding that B4 is lower than D#5 and F#5 is the final step in identifying the correct answer.\n\nBy following these steps, we can confidently determine the lowest note.\n\n<<<B>>>"
