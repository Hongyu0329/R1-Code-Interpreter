    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe core components of the question are:\n*   **Subject:** Two individuals.\n*   **Distinction:** They are both Nobel laureates.\n*   **Context:** They were featured in a commercial.\n*   **Company:** The commercial was for Enron.\n*   **Timeframe:** The year was 2000.\n*   **Key Detail:** The commercial had the tagline \"Ask Why\".\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Advertising Campaign**\nThe \"Ask Why\" campaign was a high-profile advertising effort by Enron in 2000. It was intended to portray the company as an innovative, forward-thinking entity that questioned traditional business models. The campaign became infamous after Enron's spectacular collapse in 2001 due to a massive accounting scandal, making the tagline deeply ironic.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Nobel Laureates Involved**\nThe campaign featured several notable personalities. Research into the specific commercials from this campaign reveals the two economists who were featured.\n\n*   **Individual 1: Paul Krugman**\n    *   He is a prominent economist and columnist.\n    *   He appeared in one of the \"Ask Why\" commercials.\n    *   **Careful Point:** At the time the commercial aired in 2000, Paul Krugman was not yet a Nobel laureate. He was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 2008. However, he is now a Nobel laureate, and the question asks which two laureates were featured, not which two people who were laureates *at the time* were featured. He has since publicly expressed his regret for participating.\n\n*   **Individual 2: Merton Miller**\n    *   He was a distinguished economist from the University of Chicago.\n    *   He also appeared in an \"Ask Why\" commercial.\n    *   **Careful Point:** Unlike Krugman, Merton Miller was already a Nobel laureate when the commercial was made. He received the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 1990. He passed away in June 2000, the same year the campaign was running.\n\n**Step 4: Synthesize the Final Answer**\nBased on the analysis, the two individuals who fit the description of \"Nobel laureates\" featured in the infamous 2000 Enron \"Ask Why\" commercials are Paul Krugman and Merton Miller.\n\n<<<Paul Krugman and Merton Miller>>>"
