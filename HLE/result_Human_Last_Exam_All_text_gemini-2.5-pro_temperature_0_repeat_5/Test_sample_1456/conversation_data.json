    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the largest possible number of composants of the product of two nondegenerate continua.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Core Concepts\n\n*   **Continuum:** A compact, connected metric space. Since it's a metric space, it is also separable.\n*   **Nondegenerate Continuum:** A continuum containing more than one point. A key property of a nondegenerate continuum `X` is that its cardinality `|X|` is `c`, the cardinality of the continuum (`c = 2^{\\aleph_0}`).\n*   **Composant:** For a point `p` in a continuum `X`, the composant of `p`, denoted `Comp(p)`, is the union of all proper subcontinua of `X` that contain `p`. A subcontinuum is a subset that is also a continuum. A proper subcontinuum of `X` is a subcontinuum that is not equal to `X`.\n*   **Properties of Composants:**\n    1.  The set of all composants of a continuum `X` forms a partition of `X`.\n    2.  Each composant is a dense subset of `X`.\n    3.  The number of composants of a continuum `X`, denoted `n(X)`, can be 1, a finite integer greater than 1, or `c`. It is a known theorem by S. Mazurkiewicz that a continuum cannot have a countably infinite number of composants.\n*   **Types of Continua and their Number of Composants:**\n    *   **Locally connected continua:** `n(X) = 1`. Example: `[0, 1]`, the n-sphere `S^n`.\n    *   **Decomposable, but not locally connected continua:** `n(X)` can be a finite number greater than 1. Example: The closure of the topologist's sine curve has `n(X) = 2`.\n    *   **Indecomposable continua:** `n(X) = c`. An indecomposable continuum is one that cannot be written as the union of two of its proper subcontinua. Example: The pseudo-arc, the buckethandle continuum.\n\n### Step 2: Setting up the Problem\n\nLet `X` and `Y` be two nondegenerate continua. We are interested in the product space `Z = X \\times Y`.\n*   Since `X` and `Y` are compact, connected, and metric, their product `Z = X \\times Y` is also a compact, connected, metric space, i.e., a continuum.\n*   We want to find the maximum possible value for `n(X \\times Y)`, the number of composants of `Z`.\n\n### Step 3: Establishing an Upper Bound\n\nThe number of composants of any space is at most the cardinality of that space. This is because the composants form a disjoint partition of the space, and each composant is non-empty.\n1.  Since `X` and `Y` are nondegenerate continua, their cardinalities are `|X| = c` and `|Y| = c`.\n2.  The cardinality of the product space is `|Z| = |X \\times Y| = |X| \\cdot |Y| = c \\cdot c = c`.\n3.  Therefore, the number of composants of `Z` must be less than or equal to `c`.\n    `n(X \\times Y) \\le c`.\nThis means the largest possible number of composants is at most `c`.\n\n### Step 4: Finding an Example to Achieve the Upper Bound\n\nTo show that `c` is the largest *possible* number, we need to find an example of two nondegenerate continua `X` and `Y` such that their product `X \\times Y` has exactly `c` composants.\n\nLet's use a known theorem from continuum theory:\n**Theorem (J. M. Lysko, 1977):** If `X` is a continuum and `Y` is a locally connected continuum, then the composants of the product space `X \\times Y` are precisely the sets of the form `C \\times Y`, where `C` is a composant of `X`.\n\nThis theorem implies that under these conditions, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the composants of `X` and the composants of `X \\times Y`. Therefore, `n(X \\times Y) = n(X)`.\n\nNow, we can choose `X` and `Y` to maximize this number.\n1.  Choose `Y` to be a nondegenerate, locally connected continuum. A simple choice is the closed interval `Y = [0, 1]`.\n2.  Choose `X` to be a continuum with the maximum possible number of composants. As mentioned in Step 1, an indecomposable continuum has `c` composants. Let's choose `X` to be the **pseudo-arc**, which is a well-known indecomposable continuum. For the pseudo-arc, `n(X) = c`.\n\nApplying the theorem to this choice of `X` and `Y`:\n*   `X` is the pseudo-arc (a continuum).\n*   `Y = [0, 1]` (a locally connected continuum).\n*   The number of composants of their product is `n(X \\times Y) = n(X)`.\n*   Since `n(X) = c`, we have `n(X \\times Y) = c`.\n\nThis example demonstrates that it is possible for the product of two nondegenerate continua to have `c` composants.\n\n### Step 5: Conclusion\n\n1.  We established that the number of composants of `X \\times Y` can be no more than `c`.\n2.  We found a specific example where the number of composants is exactly `c`.\n\nTherefore, the largest possible number of composants of the product of two nondegenerate continua is `c`, the cardinality of the continuum.\n\n<<<c>>>"
