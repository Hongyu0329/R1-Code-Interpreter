    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of true boolean expressions of exactly 5 symbols.\n\n**Symbols:** {T, F, !, &, |, (, )}\n**Length:** 5\n**Value:** True\n**Precedence:** ! > & > |\n\nLet's break down the problem by analyzing all possible valid syntactic structures for an expression of length 5. We can categorize them into expressions without parentheses and expressions with parentheses.\n\n### Part 1: Expressions without Parentheses\n\nThese expressions are formed using operands (T, F), unary operator (!), and binary operators (&, |).\n\n1.  **Structure: `O B O B O`** (3 operands, 2 binary operators)\n    *   This structure represents expressions like `T & F | T`. The evaluation depends on operator precedence.\n    *   **Case 1.1: `O & O & O`**: Evaluates to True only for `T & T & T`. (1 expression)\n    *   **Case 1.2: `O | O | O`**: Evaluates to False only for `F | F | F`. Since there are `2^3 = 8` operand combinations, there are `8 - 1 = 7` true expressions.\n    *   **Case 1.3: `O & O | O`**: Parsed as `(O & O) | O`. This is true if the third operand is `T` (4 combinations), or if the third is `F` and the first two are `T` (1 combination: `T & T | F`). Total: `4 + 1 = 5` true expressions.\n    *   **Case 1.4: `O | O & O`**: Parsed as `O | (O & O)`. This is true if the first operand is `T` (4 combinations), or if the first is `F` and the last two are `T` (1 combination: `F | T & T`). Total: `4 + 1 = 5` true expressions.\n    *   Total for this structure: `1 + 7 + 5 + 5 = 18`.\n\n2.  **Structure: `! ! ! ! O`** (1 operand, 4 unary operators)\n    *   `!!!!O` simplifies to `O`.\n    *   It is true only if `O` is `T`. The expression is `!!!!T`. (1 expression)\n\n3.  **Structure: `! ! O B O`** (2 operands, 1 binary, 2 unary)\n    *   Parsed as `(!!O) B O`, which simplifies to `O B O`.\n    *   **Case 3.1: `!!O & O`**: True only for `!!T & T`. (1 expression)\n    *   **Case 3.2: `!!O | O`**: True for 3 of 4 operand combinations (`!!T|T`, `!!T|F`, `!!F|T`). (3 expressions)\n    *   Total: `1 + 3 = 4`.\n\n4.  **Structure: `O B ! ! O`** (Symmetric to the previous structure)\n    *   Parsed as `O B (!!O)`, which simplifies to `O B O`.\n    *   Total: `1 + 3 = 4`.\n\n5.  **Structure: `! O B ! O`**\n    *   Parsed as `(!O) B (!O)`.\n    *   **Case 5.1: `!O & !O`**: True only for `!F & !F`. (1 expression)\n    *   **Case 5.2: `!O | !O`**: True for 3 of 4 operand combinations (`!T|!F`, `!F|!T`, `!F|!F`). (3 expressions)\n    *   Total: `1 + 3 = 4`.\n\n**Total for unparenthesized expressions:** `18 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 31`.\n\n### Part 2: Expressions with Parentheses\n\nThese expressions must contain one pair of `()`.\n\n1.  **Structure: `( E )` where E has length 3**\n    *   **Case 1.1: `(O B O)`**: Simplifies to `O B O`.\n        *   `(O & O)`: True only for `(T & T)`. (1 expression)\n        *   `(O | O)`: True for 3 combinations (`(T|T)`, `(T|F)`, `(F|T)`). (3 expressions)\n        *   Total: `1 + 3 = 4`.\n    *   **Case 1.2: `(!!O)`**: Simplifies to `O`. True only for `(!!T)`. (1 expression)\n    *   **Case 1.3: `((O))`**: Simplifies to `O`. True only for `((T))`. (1 expression)\n    *   Total for this structure: `4 + 1 + 1 = 6`.\n\n2.  **Structure involving `!` and `()`**\n    *   **Case 2.1: `!(!O)`**: Length is 5 (`! ( ! O )`). Simplifies to `O`. True only for `!(!T)`. (1 expression)\n    *   **Case 2.2: `!!(O)`**: Length is 5 (`! ! ( O )`). Simplifies to `O`. True only for `!!(T)`. (1 expression)\n    *   Total for this structure: `1 + 1 = 2`.\n\n3.  **Structure with a parenthesized sub-expression and an outer operator**\n    *   **Case 3.1: `(O) B O`**: Simplifies to `O B O`.\n        *   `(O) & O`: True only for `(T) & T`. (1 expression)\n        *   `(O) | O`: True for 3 combinations. (3 expressions)\n        *   Total: `1 + 3 = 4`.\n    *   **Case 3.2: `O B (O)`**: Symmetric to the previous case. Total: 4.\n    *   **Case 3.3: `(!O) B O`**:\n        *   `(!O) & O`: True only for `(!F) & T`. (1 expression)\n        *   `(!O) | O`: True for 3 combinations (`(!T)|T`, `(!F)|T`, `(!F)|F`). (3 expressions)\n        *   Total: `1 + 3 = 4`.\n    *   **Case 3.4: `O B (!O)`**: Symmetric to the previous case. Total: 4.\n    *   Total for this structure: `4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 16`.\n\n**Total for parenthesized expressions:** `6 + 2 + 16 = 24`.\n\n### Final Calculation\n\nTotal True Expressions = (Unparenthesized) + (Parenthesized)\nTotal True Expressions = 31 + 24 = 55.\n\nFinal Answer:\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{55}$.\n<<<55>>>"
