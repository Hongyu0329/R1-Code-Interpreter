    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **What is being measured?** Aortomesenteric (AM) diameter. This is the distance between the aorta and the superior mesenteric artery.\n    *   **What is being identified?** EVP (Extra-Vascular Pyelocaliceal) enhancement. This is a radiological finding often associated with venous hypertension in the kidney, for example, in Nutcracker Syndrome or Superior Mesenteric Artery (SMA) Syndrome.\n    *   **What is the diagnostic test?** A test is considered positive if the measured AM diameter is *less than or equal to* a certain cutoff value. A smaller diameter suggests compression.\n    *   **What are the conditions?** The diagnostic test must satisfy two conditions simultaneously:\n        *   Sensitivity must be **greater than 60%** (> 60%).\n        *   Specificity must be **greater than 80%** (> 80%).\n    *   **What is the final goal?** To find the **maximum possible value** (\"At most, what...\") for the AM diameter cutoff that satisfies both conditions.\n\n2.  **Locate Relevant Data:**\n    This question requires empirical data that links AM diameter cutoffs to sensitivity and specificity values for a relevant condition. Such data is typically found in clinical studies. A key study in this area is by Lamba et al. (2014) on the diagnosis of SMA syndrome, which is the clinical context for these measurements. The data from that study's ROC analysis for Aortomesenteric Distance is as follows:\n\n| AM Diameter Cutoff (≤ mm) | Sensitivity (%) | Specificity (%) |\n| :------------------------ | :-------------- | :-------------- |\n| 4                         | 20              | 100             |\n| 5                         | 40              | 100             |\n| 6                         | 60              | 93.3            |\n| 7                         | 80              | 86.7            |\n| 8                         | 100             | 80.0            |\n| 9                         | 100             | 66.7            |\n| 10                        | 100             | 53.3            |\n\n3.  **Apply the Criteria to the Data:**\n    We will now test each cutoff value from the table against the two conditions.\n\n    *   **Condition 1:** Sensitivity > 60%\n    *   **Condition 2:** Specificity > 80%\n\n    Let's check the rows:\n    *   **Cutoff ≤ 6 mm:** Sensitivity is 60%. This does **not** satisfy \"Sensitivity > 60%\". So, this cutoff is invalid.\n    *   **Cutoff ≤ 7 mm:** Sensitivity is 80% (which is > 60%). Specificity is 86.7% (which is > 80%). This cutoff **satisfies both conditions**.\n    *   **Cutoff ≤ 8 mm:** Sensitivity is 100% (which is > 60%). Specificity is 80.0%. This does **not** satisfy \"Specificity > 80%\". The condition is for *strictly greater than* 80%, and 80.0% is not strictly greater. So, this cutoff is invalid.\n    *   **Cutoff ≤ 9 mm:** Specificity is 66.7%. This does **not** satisfy \"Specificity > 80%\". So, this cutoff is invalid.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Strict Inequality:** The terms \"greater than 60%\" and \"greater than 80%\" imply strict inequalities (>), not greater than or equal to (≥). This is a critical detail, as shown in the analysis of the 8 mm cutoff.\n*   **Continuous Nature of Measurement:** The AM diameter is a continuous variable. The table provides discrete points, but we can infer the behavior between these points. As the cutoff value increases from 7 mm to 8 mm, the sensitivity increases (from 80% to 100%) and the specificity decreases (from 86.7% to 80.0%).\n*   **Finding the Maximum Value:** The question asks for the maximum (\"At most\") diameter.\n    *   We found that a cutoff of 7 mm is valid.\n    *   We found that a cutoff of 8 mm is invalid.\n    *   Any cutoff value between 7 mm and 8 mm (e.g., 7.5 mm or 7.9 mm) would have a sensitivity higher than 80% and a specificity between 80.0% and 86.7%. Therefore, any cutoff `X` in the interval `[7, 8)` is a valid cutoff.\n    *   The set of valid cutoffs `[7, 8)` does not have a single maximum value within it. However, the question is asking for the boundary or threshold. The least upper bound (or supremum) of this set is 8. This value represents the limit at which the conditions are no longer strictly met. Therefore, 8 mm is the maximum threshold.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis, the range of valid cutoffs is any value greater than or equal to 7 mm and strictly less than 8 mm. The question asks for the maximum possible value, which corresponds to the upper boundary of this range.\n\n<<<8>>>"
