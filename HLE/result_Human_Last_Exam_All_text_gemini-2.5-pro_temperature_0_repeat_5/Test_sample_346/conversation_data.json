    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the SKI combinator expression to find the value of `n` and then `log_2(n)`.\n\n**The Expression:**\n`E = S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(S(S(K(S))(K))(I)))))(S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I))))`\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\nThe expression `E` represents a Church numeral `n`. A Church numeral `n` is a function that takes another function `f` and a value `x`, and applies `f` to `x` a total of `n` times. This can be written as `n f x = f^n(x)`. Our goal is to find the value of `n` by reducing the expression `E f x`.\n\n**Step 2: Define the Basic SKI Combinators**\n*   `S x y z = x z (y z)`\n*   `K x y = x`\n*   `I x = x`\n\n**Step 3: Deconstruct the Expression**\nLet's break down the expression `E` into a more manageable structure. The expression has the form `S A B C`, but it's nested. Let's apply it to `f` and `x` to see how it reduces.\n\nLet's define two complex sub-expressions to simplify the notation:\n*   Let `Z = K(S(S(K(S))(K))(I))`\n*   Let `W = S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I))`\n\nNow, the expression `E` can be written as:\n`E = S(I)(S(I)(S(I) Z)) W`\n\n**Step 4: Reduce `E f x`**\nWe will apply `E` to `f` and `x` and use the reduction rules.\n\n1.  `E f x = [S(I)(S(I)(S(I) Z)) W] f x`\n    Using the `S` rule `S a b c = a c (b c)` where `a = I`, `b = S(I)(S(I) Z) W`, and `c = f`:\n    `= (I f) ( (S(I)(S(I) Z)) W f ) x`\n\n2.  Since `I f = f`, this simplifies to:\n    `= f ( (S(I)(S(I) Z)) W f x )`\n    This is the first application of `f`.\n\n3.  Now let's reduce the inner part: `(S(I)(S(I) Z)) W f x`.\n    This is equivalent to `[S(I)(S(I) Z) W] f x`. Using the `S` rule again where `a = I`, `b = S(I) Z W`, and `c = f`:\n    `= (I f) ( (S(I) Z) W f ) x`\n    `= f ( (S(I) Z) W f x )`\n    Substituting this back into our main expression:\n    `E f x = f ( f ( (S(I) Z) W f x ) )`\n    This is the second application of `f`.\n\n4.  Let's reduce the next inner part: `(S(I) Z) W f x`.\n    Using the `S` rule one more time where `a = I`, `b = Z W`, and `c = f`:\n    `= (I f) ( (Z W) f ) x`\n    `= f ( (Z W) f x )`\n    Substituting this back into the main expression:\n    `E f x = f ( f ( f ( (Z W) f x ) ) )`\n    This is the third application of `f`. We can write this as `f^3((Z W) f x)`.\n\n**Step 5: Evaluate the Innermost Term `(Z W) f x`**\nNow we need to figure out what `(Z W) f x` evaluates to.\n\n1.  Recall the definitions of `Z` and `W`:\n    *   `Z = K(S(S(K(S))(K))(I))`\n    *   `W = S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I))`\n\n2.  The expression is `(Z W) f x = Z W f x`. Let's apply `Z` to `W`.\n    `Z W = [K(S(S(K(S))(K))(I))] W`\n\n3.  Here we use the `K` combinator rule: `K a b = a`.\n    In our case, `a = S(S(K(S))(K))(I)` and `b = W`.\n    So, `Z W = K a b = a`. The entire complex expression `W` is discarded.\n    `Z W = S(S(K(S))(K))(I)`\n\n4.  Therefore, `(Z W) f x` simplifies to `[S(S(K(S))(K))(I)] f x`.\n\n**Step 6: Evaluate `[S(S(K(S))(K))(I)] f x`**\nThis remaining expression is a known combinator.\n\n1.  Let's identify the composition combinator `B = S(K S) K`. The `B` combinator composes two functions: `B f g x = f(g x)`.\n2.  The expression `S(S(K S) K)` is `S(B)`, which is the Phoenix combinator `Φ`.\n3.  So, `S(S(K(S))(K))(I)` is `(S(B)) I` or `Φ I`.\n\nLet's evaluate `(Φ I) f x`:\n`(Φ I) f x = (S(B) I) f x`\nUsing the `S` rule `S a b c = a c (b c)`:\n`= (B I) (f I) x`\nUsing the `B` rule `B a b c = a (b c)`:\n`= I ( (f I) x )`\nUsing the `I` rule `I a = a`:\n`= (f I) x`\nBy the definition of function application:\n`= f (I x)`\nUsing the `I` rule again:\n`= f x`\n\nSo, the entire inner expression `(Z W) f x` reduces to `f x`.\n\n**Step 7: Final Calculation**\nLet's substitute our result from Step 6 back into the expression from Step 4.\n\n`E f x = f^3 ( (Z W) f x )`\n`E f x = f^3 ( f x )`\n`E f x = f(f(f(f x)))`\n`E f x = f^4 x`\n\nThis shows that the expression `E` represents the Church numeral for `n = 4`.\n\nThe question asks for `log_2(n)`.\n`log_2(n) = log_2(4) = 2`\n\n<<<2>>>"
