    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the earliest known recorded date from a pre-Columbian civilization.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe question asks for four key things:\n1.  An **earliest known date**.\n2.  It must be **recorded** (written down).\n3.  By a **pre-Columbian civilization** in the Americas.\n4.  Using an **aboriginal writing system**.\n\nThis means we are not looking for the earliest evidence of writing itself, but for the earliest specific calendar date that was inscribed. This points us toward civilizations that used an absolute dating system, not just a cyclical one.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Potential Civilizations and their Dating Systems**\nSeveral pre-Columbian Mesoamerican cultures developed writing and complex calendars. The main candidates for the earliest recorded date are:\n\n*   **Zapotec:** Developed one of the earliest writing systems in Mesoamerica (around 600-400 BCE). They used a 260-day sacred calendar and a 365-day solar calendar. However, their dates are recorded within a 52-year cycle (the Calendar Round), making it difficult to assign them an absolute year in our modern calendar without other context.\n*   **Epi-Olmec:** This culture, which followed the Olmec, used a writing system and a calendar known as the Mesoamerican Long Count. The Long Count is an absolute calendar that counts days from a mythical starting point (equivalent to August 11, 3114 BCE), allowing for the precise dating of events over long periods.\n*   **Maya:** The Maya are famous for their sophisticated hieroglyphic writing and their extensive use of the Long Count calendar.\n\n**Step 3: Compare the Earliest Recorded Dates from Each Civilization**\n\n*   **Zapotec:** While monuments at Monte Albán (like Stela 12) have calendar glyphs dating to as early as 500 BCE, they represent dates within the 52-year Calendar Round. We cannot definitively say, for example, that a date corresponds to \"450 BCE\" rather than \"398 BCE\" (52 years later). Therefore, they do not represent the earliest known *absolute* date.\n\n*   **Maya:** The earliest widely accepted Long Count date from a Maya artifact is found on **Tikal Stela 29**. The date recorded is **8.12.14.8.15**, which correlates to **July 6, 292 CE** in the Gregorian calendar.\n\n*   **Epi-Olmec:** This culture provides the earliest known absolute dates. The key artifact is **Tres Zapotes Stela C**. This monument has a date inscribed in the Long Count system. The date is **7.16.6.16.18**.\n\n**Step 4: Correlate the Earliest Date to the Gregorian Calendar**\nThe Long Count date on Tres Zapotes Stela C, **7.16.6.16.18**, is significantly earlier than the first known Maya Long Count date (it starts with a 7 in the highest position, or *b'ak'tun*, while the Tikal stela starts with an 8).\n\nUsing the standard GMT (Goodman-Martínez-Thompson) correlation to convert this Long Count date to our calendar, we get:\n*   **7.16.6.16.18** = **September 3, 32 BCE**.\n\nAnother Epi-Olmec artifact, the Tuxtla Statuette, has a later date of 8.6.2.4.17, which corresponds to 162 CE. This confirms that the date on Stela C is the earlier of the two key Epi-Olmec examples.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Writing vs. Dated Text:** The earliest evidence of writing in the Americas is the Cascajal Block (Olmec, c. 900 BCE), but it does not contain a calendar date. The question specifically asks for a recorded date.\n2.  **Absolute vs. Relative Dating:** The Long Count provides an absolute date, whereas the Zapotec Calendar Round provides a relative date within a 52-year cycle. For the \"earliest known date,\" an absolute date is required.\n3.  **Artifact and Culture:** The artifact is Tres Zapotes Stela C, and the culture is Epi-Olmec, not Olmec or Maya. This is a common point of confusion.\n4.  **Correlation Constant:** The conversion to a Gregorian date depends on a correlation constant (the GMT correlation). While this is the overwhelming scholarly consensus, it is technically a correlation, not a direct translation. However, it is the standard for answering this question.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBy comparing the evidence, the date recorded on the Epi-Olmec monument, Tres Zapotes Stela C, is the earliest known absolute date recorded in a native writing system in the Americas.\n\n<<<September 3, 32 BCE>>>"
