The pharmacist should advise Allison to contact her doctor to discuss her new headaches. It should be explained that new or worsening headaches, especially with unusual triggers like a specific smell (which could be a migraine aura), are important to evaluate while taking an estrogen-containing birth control like Junel Fe. This is because migraine with aura is a contraindication for this medication due to an increased risk of stroke, and her doctor needs to determine if Junel Fe is still a safe option for her.
