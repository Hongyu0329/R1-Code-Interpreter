To be functionally accurate, the picnic table must change its shape in response to sunlight. When the sun rises, the UV light should cause the table to convert from its flat, extended form (representing the stable *trans*-isomer) into a bent or folded form (representing the *cis*-isomer). When the sun sets and the UV light disappears, the table should relax back from its bent/folded state to its original flat, extended form, mimicking the *cis*-to-*trans* thermal relaxation.
