    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of Triple Crown winners in MLB history.\n\n### Step 1: Define the MLB Batting Triple Crown\nThe Triple Crown in Major League Baseball refers to a batter leading their respective league (American League or National League) in three specific offensive categories in the same season:\n1.  **Batting Average**\n2.  **Home Runs (HR)**\n3.  **Runs Batted In (RBI)**\n\n### Step 2: List All Instances of a Triple Crown Win\nTo find the number of winners, we must first list every time a player has achieved this feat. It's helpful to separate them by league.\n\n**American League (AL) Triple Crown Wins:**\n*   **1901:** Nap Lajoie\n*   **1909:** Ty Cobb\n*   **1933:** Jimmie Foxx\n*   **1934:** Lou Gehrig\n*   **1942:** Ted Williams\n*   **1947:** Ted Williams\n*   **1956:** Mickey Mantle\n*   **1966:** Frank Robinson\n*   **1967:** Carl Yastrzemski\n*   **2012:** Miguel Cabrera\n\n**National League (NL) Triple Crown Wins:**\n*   **1878:** Paul Hines\n*   **1887:** Tip O'Neill*\n*   **1894:** Hugh Duffy\n*   **1912:** Heinie Zimmerman\n*   **1922:** Rogers Hornsby\n*   **1925:** Rogers Hornsby\n*   **1933:** Chuck Klein\n*   **1937:** Joe Medwick\n\n### Step 3: Identify Careful Points and Considerations\n1.  **Number of Wins vs. Number of Winners:** The question asks for the number of *winners* (i.e., the number of unique players), not the total number of times the Triple Crown has been won. Two players have won it twice:\n    *   Ted Williams (1942, 1947)\n    *   Rogers Hornsby (1922, 1925)\n    These two players should only be counted once each in the final tally of winners.\n\n2.  **Historical Leagues:** The list includes players from baseball's early history.\n    *   Paul Hines' 1878 Triple Crown is recognized by MLB, although some historical records from that era can be inconsistent.\n    *   Tip O'Neill won his Triple Crown in 1887 while playing in the American Association. MLB officially recognizes the American Association (1882â€“1891) as a major league, so his achievement is included.\n\n3.  **Rarity:** The Triple Crown is an exceptionally rare feat. Note the 45-year gap between Carl Yastrzemski's win in 1967 and Miguel Cabrera's in 2012, highlighting its difficulty in the modern era.\n\n### Step 4: Count the Unique Winners\nNow, we will count the number of unique individuals from the lists in Step 2.\n\n**American League Winners (9 unique players):**\n1.  Nap Lajoie\n2.  Ty Cobb\n3.  Jimmie Foxx\n4.  Lou Gehrig\n5.  Ted Williams (won twice)\n6.  Mickey Mantle\n7.  Frank Robinson\n8.  Carl Yastrzemski\n9.  Miguel Cabrera\n\n**National League Winners (7 unique players):**\n1.  Paul Hines\n2.  Tip O'Neill\n3.  Hugh Duffy\n4.  Heinie Zimmerman\n5.  Rogers Hornsby (won twice)\n6.  Chuck Klein\n7.  Joe Medwick\n\n**Total Unique Winners:**\nAdding the unique winners from both leagues: 9 (from AL) + 7 (from NL) = 16.\n\n### Final Answer\nBy listing all the times the Triple Crown has been won and then counting each player only once, we arrive at the final number.\n\n<<<16>>>"
