No, the local magnetic field at the L1 point is generally not considered to be radial. The justification for using magnetic field components perpendicular to the radial direction to calculate normalized magnetic helicity is based on a common and practical approximation.

1.  **Field Direction at L1:** The magnetic field at L1 is the Interplanetary Magnetic Field (IMF). Due to the Sun's rotation and the outward flow of the solar wind, the IMF forms a spiral shape (the Parker Spiral). At the distance of L1 (1 AU), the average angle between the IMF and the radial direction is approximately 45 degrees. Therefore, the field is distinctly non-radial.

2.  **Justification for the Calculation Method:** The practice of using components perpendicular to the radial direction (e.g., the Y and Z components in the GSE coordinate system) is an approximation rooted in **Taylor's Hypothesis**.
    *   Taylor's Hypothesis assumes that the solar wind flows much faster than the waves within it. This allows a time series from a single spacecraft to be interpreted as a spatial measurement along the solar wind flow direction, which is predominantly radial.
    *   Consequently, this method calculates the magnetic helicity in the plane perpendicular to the **solar wind velocity vector ($\vec{V}_{sw}$)**, not the plane perpendicular to the **local magnetic field vector ($\vec{B}_0$)**.
    *   This introduces a projection effect. The measured helicity is an underestimation of the true physical helicity, reduced by a factor of roughly $\cos(\theta_{VB})$, where $\theta_{VB}$ is the angle between the solar wind velocity and the magnetic field.
    *   This approximation is considered acceptable because:
        *   It is computationally simple for analyzing large datasets.
        *   It correctly preserves the sign of the helicity (left vs. right polarization), which is often the most critical piece of information.
        *   For more rigorous analyses, scientists often filter the data to only use intervals where the magnetic field is nearly aligned with the radial flow direction (small $\theta_{VB}$), making the approximation highly accurate.
