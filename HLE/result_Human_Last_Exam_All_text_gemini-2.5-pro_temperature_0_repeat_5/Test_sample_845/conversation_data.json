    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the name of the value computed between heartbeats for HRV analysis.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The core of the question is to identify the name of the measurement taken *between* individual heartbeats, which is then used to calculate Heart Rate Variability (HRV). The method of capture is specified as PPG (Photoplethysmography).\n\n2.  **Understand the Basic Measurement:**\n    *   Heart Rate (HR) is typically an average, like 60 beats *per minute*.\n    *   Heart Rate Variability (HRV), however, looks at the precise timing *between each beat*. If your heart beats, there is a specific duration of time until the next beat. This duration is not perfectly constant; it varies slightly from beat to beat.\n    *   This time duration between two consecutive heartbeats is the fundamental data point.\n\n3.  **Identify the Technical Term:**\n    *   The general technical term for the time elapsed between two consecutive heartbeats is the **Inter-Beat Interval (IBI)**. This term is universal and applies regardless of the measurement technology (like PPG or ECG).\n    *   The prompt itself uses the descriptive phrase \"beat-to-beat intervals,\" and IBI is the formal name for this.\n\n4.  **Consider Technology-Specific Terms (Careful Points):**\n    *   **ECG (Electrocardiogram):** This is the clinical gold standard. It measures the heart's electrical signals. The most prominent part of this signal is the \"QRS complex,\" with the \"R-wave\" being the highest peak. The time between two consecutive R-waves is called the **R-R Interval**. This is a very common term for IBI in clinical and research contexts.\n    *   **PPG (Photoplethysmography):** This is the technology used in most smartwatches and fitness trackers. It measures changes in blood volume by shining a light on the skin. The time between the peaks of the pulse waves detected by PPG is also a measure of the Inter-Beat Interval. Sometimes this is referred to as a **Peak-to-Peak (P-P) Interval**.\n    *   **NN Interval (Normal-to-Normal Interval):** This is a refined version of the R-R Interval or IBI. In a series of beat-to-beat intervals, some beats might be abnormal (e.g., premature ventricular contractions or other arrhythmias). For accurate HRV analysis, these abnormal beats are often filtered out. The remaining intervals, which are between two consecutive \"normal\" sinus rhythm beats, are called NN intervals. Most HRV metrics (like SDNN, RMSSD) are calculated using these filtered NN intervals.\n\n5.  **Synthesize and Conclude:**\n    *   The question asks for the \"value between heartbeats.\"\n    *   The most direct and general answer is **Inter-Beat Interval (IBI)**.\n    *   While R-R Interval is also correct, it is specific to ECG. Since the prompt mentions PPG, IBI is a more appropriate and general term.\n    *   NN Interval is a *filtered* version of the IBI, used for calculation, but the fundamental measurement itself is the IBI.\n    *   Therefore, the value captured between heartbeats is the Inter-Beat Interval.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe value computed between heartbeats is called the **Inter-Beat Interval (IBI)**. In the context of an ECG, this is more specifically known as the **R-R Interval**.\n\n<<<Inter-Beat Interval (IBI)"
