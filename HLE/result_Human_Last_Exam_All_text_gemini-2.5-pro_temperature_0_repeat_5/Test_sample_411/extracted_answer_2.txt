(a) The diversity order for code $\mathbf{S}_a$ is 1, for code $\mathbf{S}_b$ is 1, and for code $\mathbf{S}_c$ is 2.
(b) Code $\mathbf{S}_c$ provides the maximum directivity. This is because it is an Orthogonal Space-Time Block Code (OSTBC), which achieves full diversity and allows for simple linear decoding, a highly desirable property not shared by $\mathbf{S}_a$ or $\mathbf{S}_b$.
