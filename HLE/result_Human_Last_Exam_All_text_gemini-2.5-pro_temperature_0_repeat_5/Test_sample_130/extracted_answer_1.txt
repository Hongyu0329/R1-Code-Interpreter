The edges of the image will be smoothed. Specifically, any sharp corners will be rounded, and any concave indentations will be filled in. The iterative process will continue until the image reaches a fixed point where all remaining boundaries are either straight lines or curves whose radius of curvature is everywhere greater than the filter's radius, Î´. Small or thin shapes with dimensions smaller than the filter size will be eliminated entirely.
