    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the computational time complexity of the given algorithm `IMAG(n, c)`.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Algorithm's Goal:**\n    The algorithm `IMAG(n, c)` takes a non-negative integer `n` and an integer base `c` (where `c ≥ 2`) and computes the representation of `n` in base `c`. For example, `IMAG(13, 2)` would produce the binary representation `(1101)`. The algorithm works by repeatedly taking the remainder (`x mod c`) to find the next digit and then updating the number by integer division (`x / c`).\n\n2.  **Decompose the Algorithm into Basic Steps:**\n    The algorithm can be broken down into three main parts:\n    *   **Step 1: Initialization.** This part is executed once before the loop.\n    *   **Step 2: The `while` loop.** This is the core of the algorithm, and its execution time depends on how many times it iterates.\n    *   **Step 3: Return.** This step simply returns the computed result.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Cost of Each Part:**\n    We will analyze the complexity assuming the standard computational model where basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) on numbers that fit within a machine's word size take constant time, which is denoted as `O(1)`.\n\n    *   **Cost of Initialization (Step 1):**\n        `i := 0; x := n; q := ⌊x/c⌋; a_{0} := x — qc;`\n        This step involves a few assignments, one integer division, one multiplication, and one subtraction. All of these are considered `O(1)` operations. Therefore, the total time for the initialization step is constant: **`O(1)`**.\n\n    *   **Cost of the `while` loop (Step 2):**\n        The total cost of the loop is the number of times the loop runs multiplied by the cost of the operations inside the loop.\n        *   **Cost of the loop body (Step 2.1):**\n            `i := i + 1; x := q; q :=. ⌊x/c⌋; a_{i} := x — qc`\n            The body of the loop consists of an increment, an assignment, an integer division, a multiplication, and a subtraction. Each of these operations takes `O(1)` time. Thus, the cost of a single iteration of the loop is constant: **`O(1)`**.\n        *   **Number of Iterations:**\n            The loop continues as long as `q > 0`. Let's analyze how the value of `q` changes.\n            - Before the loop, `q` is `⌊n/c⌋`.\n            - In each iteration, the old value of `q` is used to calculate the new `q` as `⌊old_q / c⌋`.\n            - This means the value of `q` is reduced by a factor of `c` in each iteration.\n            - The process of repeatedly dividing a number `n` by a constant `c` until it becomes 0 takes a number of steps proportional to the logarithm of `n` to the base `c`, i.e., `log_c(n)`.\n            - More formally, the loop runs `k` times. After `k` iterations, the value of `q` will be `⌊n / c^(k+1)⌋`. The loop stops when this value becomes 0. This occurs when `n / c^(k+1) < 1`, or `n < c^(k+1)`. The number of iterations `k` is the smallest integer that satisfies `k > log_c(n) - 1`. Therefore, the number of iterations is `⌊log_c(n)⌋` (for `n ≥ c`).\n            - Asymptotically, the number of iterations is **`O(log_c(n))`**.\n\n    *   **Cost of Return (Step 3):**\n        Returning the final result is a constant time operation, **`O(1)`**.\n\n4.  **Combine the Costs to Find Total Complexity:**\n    The total time complexity `T(n)` is the sum of the costs of all parts:\n    `T(n) = Cost(Initialization) + Cost(Loop) + Cost(Return)`\n    `T(n) = O(1) + (Number of Iterations) × (Cost per Iteration) + O(1)`\n    `T(n) = O(1) + O(log_c(n)) × O(1) + O(1)`\n    `T(n) = O(1) + O(log_c(n)) + O(1)`\n    `T(n) = O(log_c(n))`\n\n5.  **Simplify the Final Expression:**\n    In Big-O notation, the base of the logarithm does not affect the asymptotic complexity class because logarithms of different bases are related by a constant factor (`log_c(n) = log_2(n) / log_2(c)`). Since `c` is a constant (`c ≥ 2`), `log_2(c)` is also a constant. Constant factors are ignored in Big-O notation.\n    Therefore, `O(log_c(n))` is equivalent to `O(log n)`.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Model of Computation:** The analysis relies on the assumption that basic arithmetic operations are `O(1)`. This is standard for numbers that fit in a fixed-size machine word. If `n` were an arbitrarily large number requiring a variable number of words to store, the complexity of arithmetic operations would depend on the size of `n` (i.e., `log n`), leading to a higher overall complexity of `O((log n)^2)`. However, without this specification, the standard `O(1)` assumption is used.\n*   **Loop Termination:** The key to the analysis is correctly identifying that the controlling variable `q` decreases geometrically (by a factor of `c`) in each iteration, which directly leads to a logarithmic number of iterations.\n*   **Base of Logarithm:** Remember that in the context of asymptotic complexity, `O(log_c n)` is the same as `O(log n)` for any constant base `c > 1`.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe computational time complexity of the algorithm is determined by the number of iterations of the `while` loop. The loop divides the number by the base `c` in each step. This process is repeated until the number becomes zero. The number of such divisions is proportional to `log_c(n)`. Since each iteration takes constant time, the total time complexity is `O(log_c(n))`, which is simplified to `O(log n)`.\n\n<<<O(log n)>>>"
