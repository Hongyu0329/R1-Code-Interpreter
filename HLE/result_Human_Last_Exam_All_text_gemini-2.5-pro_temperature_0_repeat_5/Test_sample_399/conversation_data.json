    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the type of differential equation and separate the variables.**\nThe given initial value problem is:\n$$\nx'(t) = (t-1)x^2(t), \\quad x(0) = -8\n$$\nThe differential equation can be written as $\\frac{dx}{dt} = (t-1)x^2$. This is a first-order separable ordinary differential equation. We can separate the variables by moving all terms involving $x$ to the left side and all terms involving $t$ to the right side.\n\n$$\n\\frac{dx}{x^2} = (t-1)dt\n$$\n\n**Careful Point:** This separation involves division by $x^2$. This is permissible only if $x \\neq 0$. We can check if $x(t)=0$ is a solution to the ODE. If $x(t)=0$, then $x'(t)=0$, and the right side is $(t-1)(0)^2=0$. So, $x(t)=0$ is an equilibrium solution. However, the initial condition is $x(0)=-8$, which is non-zero. Therefore, the solution to this specific initial value problem will not be the zero function, and our division by $x^2$ is valid.\n\n**Step 2: Integrate both sides.**\nNow we integrate both sides of the separated equation:\n$$\n\\int \\frac{1}{x^2} dx = \\int (t-1) dt\n$$\nPerforming the integration on both sides:\n$$\n\\int x^{-2} dx = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + C\n$$\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + C\n$$\nwhere $C$ is the constant of integration.\n\n**Careful Point:** A common mistake is to forget the negative sign when integrating $x^{-2}$. The integral is $\\frac{x^{-2+1}}{-2+1} = \\frac{x^{-1}}{-1} = -\\frac{1}{x}$.\n\n**Step 3: Use the initial condition to determine the constant C.**\nThe initial condition is $x(0) = -8$. We substitute $t=0$ and $x=-8$ into the general solution we found.\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{(-8)} = \\frac{(0)^2}{2} - (0) + C\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{1}{8} = C\n$$\nSo, the value of the constant of integration is $C = \\frac{1}{8}$.\n\n**Step 4: Write the particular solution.**\nNow we substitute the value of $C$ back into the general solution to get the particular solution for this initial value problem.\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + \\frac{1}{8}\n$$\n\n**Step 5: Find the value of x(1).**\nThe question asks for the value of $x(1)$. We can find this by substituting $t=1$ into the particular solution.\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{(1)^2}{2} - (1) + \\frac{1}{8}\n$$\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{1}{2} - 1 + \\frac{1}{8}\n$$\nTo combine the terms on the right side, we find a common denominator, which is 8.\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{4}{8} - \\frac{8}{8} + \\frac{1}{8}\n$$\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{4 - 8 + 1}{8}\n$$\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{-3}{8}\n$$\nNow, we solve for $x(1)$. We can multiply both sides by -1.\n$$\n\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{3}{8}\n$$\nFinally, take the reciprocal of both sides to find $x(1)$.\n$$\nx(1) = \\frac{8}{3}\n$$\n\n**Careful Point:** Ensure accuracy in the final arithmetic calculation. The sum $4-8+1$ is correctly evaluated as $-3$.\n\n<<<8/3>>>"
