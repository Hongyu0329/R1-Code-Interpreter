    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the crystal classes that are achiral, non-polar, and have the correct symmetry for optical activity.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Conditions\n\nThe question asks for crystal classes (point groups) that satisfy three specific criteria:\n1.  **Achiral:** An object is achiral if it is superimposable on its mirror image. In terms of symmetry, a crystal class is achiral if its point group contains at least one improper rotation (or rotoinversion) axis (`-n`). Improper rotations include the center of symmetry (`ī`, which is equivalent to `-1`) and the mirror plane (`m`, which is equivalent to `-2`).\n2.  **Non-polar:** A crystal class is non-polar if it does not have a unique direction (a polar axis) that is left invariant by all symmetry operations in the group. There are 10 polar crystal classes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, and 6mm. Any class not in this list is non-polar.\n3.  **Have the correct symmetry for optical activity:** This is the most critical and potentially ambiguous condition.\n    *   **Strict Definition:** Optical activity (the rotation of the plane of polarized light) is fundamentally linked to chirality. Therefore, strictly speaking, only the 11 chiral (enantiomorphic) crystal classes can be optically active. These classes contain only proper rotation axes (1, 2, 3, 4, 6) and lack all improper rotation axes (`-n`).\n    *   **The Contradiction:** The question asks for classes that are **achiral** but also have the symmetry for **optical activity**. According to the strict definition, these two conditions are mutually exclusive. No crystal class can be both achiral and chiral.\n    *   **Resolving the Contradiction:** The question is likely probing a finer point of symmetry. The most common symmetry elements that forbid optical activity are the inversion center (`ī`) and the mirror plane (`m`). It is possible for a crystal class to be achiral (due to a higher-order rotoinversion axis like `-4` or `-6`) without possessing an inversion center or a mirror plane as separate symmetry elements. We will therefore interpret \"have the correct symmetry for optical activity\" as **lacking an inversion center (`ī`) and mirror planes (`m`)**.\n\n### Step 2: Systematic Analysis of Crystal Classes\n\nWe will now search for crystal classes that meet all three conditions based on our interpretation.\n*   **Condition 1:** Must be achiral.\n*   **Condition 2:** Must be non-polar.\n*   **Condition 3:** Must lack an inversion center (`ī`) and mirror planes (`m`).\n\nLet's examine the 21 achiral crystal classes and filter them.\n\n1.  **Classes with an inversion center (`ī`):** These are immediately eliminated by Condition 3.\n    *   `ī`, `2/m`, `mmm`, `4/m`, `4/mmm`, `-3`, `-3m`, `6/m`, `6/mmm`, `m-3`, `m-3m`.\n    *   All these classes are eliminated.\n\n2.  **Remaining achiral classes (those without an inversion center):**\n    *   `m`, `mm2`, `4mm`, `3m`, `6mm`\n    *   `-4`\n    *   `-42m`\n    *   `-6`\n    *   `-6m2`\n    *   `-43m`\n\n3.  **Apply Condition 2 (must be non-polar):**\n    *   The classes `m`, `mm2`, `4mm`, `3m`, `6mm` are all polar. They are eliminated.\n\n4.  **Remaining achiral, non-polar classes (without an inversion center):**\n    *   `-4`\n    *   `-42m`\n    *   `-6`\n    *   `-6m2`\n    *   `-43m`\n\n5.  **Apply Condition 3 (must lack mirror planes `m`):**\n    *   **`-4`**: The symmetry elements are {1, -4, 2, -4³}. This group does not contain a mirror plane (`m`) or an inversion center (`ī`). It is achiral due to the `-4` axis and is non-polar. **This class is a candidate.**\n    *   **`-42m`**: The `m` in the Hermann-Mauguin symbol indicates the presence of a mirror plane. This class is eliminated.\n    *   **`-6`**: A `-6` axis is equivalent to a 3-fold rotation axis with a mirror plane perpendicular to it (`3/m`). Therefore, this class contains a mirror plane. This class is eliminated.\n    *   **`-6m2`**: The `m` in the symbol indicates a mirror plane. This class is eliminated.\n    *   **`-43m`**: The `m` in the symbol indicates a mirror plane. This class is eliminated.\n\n### Step 3: Final Conclusion\n\nAfter systematically applying all three conditions with the most plausible interpretation of the question, only one crystal class remains.\n\n*   **Class `-4` (S₄ in Schoenflies notation):**\n    *   It is **achiral** because it contains the `-4` (S₄) rotoinversion axis.\n    *   It is **non-polar**.\n    *   It **lacks an inversion center and mirror planes**, thus satisfying the interpreted symmetry condition for optical activity.\n\nWhile conventional optical activity is forbidden in class `-4` (the gyration tensor is zero), it is the only class that fits the unique combination of being achiral and non-polar while lacking the primary symmetry elements (`ī` and `m`) that forbid gyrotropy. It does allow for higher-order gyrotropic effects not found in other achiral classes that possess `ī` or `m`.\n\n<<<The only crystal class that is achiral, non-polar, and lacks an inversion center and mirror planes is -4.>>>"
