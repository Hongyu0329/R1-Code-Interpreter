No. Spontaneous parametric downconversion (SPDC) is a second-order nonlinear optical process that requires the material to have a non-zero second-order susceptibility ($\chi^{(2)}$). A non-zero bulk $\chi^{(2)}$ is only present in materials that lack a center of inversion (are non-centrosymmetric). The common, stable phases of free-standing boron nanosheets (borophene) possess crystal structures that are centrosymmetric. Due to this inversion symmetry, their bulk $\chi^{(2)}$ is zero, and therefore they are not expected to exhibit SPDC.
