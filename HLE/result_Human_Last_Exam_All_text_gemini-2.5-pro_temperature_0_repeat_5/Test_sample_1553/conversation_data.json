    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the novel and its main character.**\nThe novel in question is \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość\" (\"Perfect Imperfection\") by Jacek Dukaj. The main character is Adam Zamoyski, a man from the 21st century who is resurrected in the far future.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the key relationships of the main character.**\nThroughout the story, Adam Zamoyski's most significant and developed relationship is with a post-human entity who acts as his guide and protector. This character is central to his journey and adaptation to the future world.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the name of this key character.**\nThe name of this post-human guide, who belongs to a class of beings called \"phoebes,\" is Angelika.\n\n**Step 4: Confirm the nature of their relationship's culmination.**\nThe bond between Adam and Angelika evolves from a professional arrangement to a deep, personal, and romantic connection. This culminates in a formal union.\n\n**Step 5: Verify the marriage event.**\nThe plot of the novel includes the marriage of Adam Zamoyski and Angelika. This is a significant event in the latter part of the book, representing a union between a \"stah\" (standard human) and a powerful post-human.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n*   The main character's name is Adam Zamoyski, not Jacek Dukaj (who is the author).\n*   The concept of \"marriage\" in the novel's far-future setting is complex and has political dimensions beyond a simple romantic union.\n*   Angelika is not a standard human; she is a post-human entity, which is a crucial aspect of their relationship and the story's themes.\n\nBased on this analysis, the name of the character that the main character marries is Angelika.\n\n<<<Angelika>>>"
