  "question": "In a recent excavation of an ancient Chinese tomb, people found two books called Ching and Shu. The Ching contains exactly 9999 symbols of yinyang-wuxing, such as yin-water or yang-fire. The Shu contains around 3000 ancient Chinese characters. Using advanced language modeling and computer vision technologies, people discover that the Shu is written with only 120 most common Chinese characters at that time. The computer vision tool can recognize such a character in 12 ms. Computation time for each operation on integers and floats is 10 ns and 30 ns, respectively.\n\nPeople believe that the Ching has a secret message encrypted with its symbols. This message is also written using the letters in the Shu. What is the max length of this message?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>.",

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Goal**\nThe primary objective is to determine the *maximum possible length* of a secret message. The length is measured by the number of characters in the message.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Components of the Encryption**\n*   **Ciphertext (The Encrypted Data):** The book Ching contains \"exactly 9999 symbols\". The problem states that the secret message is \"encrypted with its symbols\". This means the 9999 symbols are the encrypted form of the message.\n*   **Plaintext (The Decrypted Message):** This is the secret message we are interested in.\n*   **Plaintext Alphabet (The characters used in the message):** The message is \"written using the letters in the Shu\", and the Shu uses \"120 most common Chinese characters\". This tells us the set of characters that make up the decrypted message.\n\n**Step 3: Establish the Relationship Between Ciphertext and Plaintext Length**\nThe process of decryption converts the ciphertext into the plaintext. We need to find the maximum length of the plaintext that can be generated from the given ciphertext.\n*   The ciphertext consists of a sequence of 9999 symbols.\n*   The plaintext consists of a sequence of characters.\n*   To maximize the length of the resulting message, we must assume the most efficient possible encoding. The most direct and information-dense encoding is a one-to-one mapping, where each symbol in the ciphertext corresponds to exactly one character in the plaintext.\n    *   **Scenario A (1-to-1 mapping):** 1 symbol -> 1 character. With 9999 symbols, this yields a 9999-character message.\n    *   **Scenario B (Many-to-1 mapping):** For example, if 2 symbols -> 1 character, the message length would be `9999 / 2`, which is shorter.\n    *   **Scenario C (1-to-Many mapping):** For example, if 1 symbol -> 2 characters, this would be a form of data expansion, which is the opposite of encryption or data hiding. It's not a plausible interpretation of \"encryption\".\n\nTherefore, the maximum length is achieved with a one-to-one mapping.\n\n**Step 4: Identify and Discard Irrelevant Information (Careful Points)**\nThe problem contains several numerical details that are not relevant to finding the message length. It's crucial to identify these as distractors.\n*   **\"Shu contains around 3000 ancient Chinese characters\":** The total size of the Shu is irrelevant. The key information is the size of the alphabet (120 characters) derived from it.\n*   **\"120 most common Chinese characters\":** This information is useful to understand what the message is made of, but it does not constrain its length. The length is constrained by the container (the Ching), not the content (the character set).\n*   **\"Computer vision tool can recognize such a character in 12 ms\":** This is a measure of processing speed for reading the Shu, not for decrypting the Ching. It is irrelevant to the message length.\n*   **\"Computation time for each operation on integers and floats is 10 ns and 30 ns\":** This is a measure of a computer's processing speed, which might be relevant for calculating decryption *time*, but not the message *length*. It is irrelevant.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion**\nThe length of the encrypted message (ciphertext) is 9999 symbols. The maximum length of the decrypted message (plaintext) is achieved when there is a one-to-one correspondence between the symbols of the ciphertext and the characters of the plaintext. Any other encoding scheme (like multiple symbols for one character) would result in a shorter message. Therefore, the maximum length of the secret message is equal to the number of symbols in the Ching.\n\nFinal Answer Calculation:\nNumber of symbols in the Ching = 9999\nMaximum characters per symbol = 1\nMaximum message length = 9999 symbols * 1 character/symbol = 9999 characters.\n\n<<<9999>>>"
