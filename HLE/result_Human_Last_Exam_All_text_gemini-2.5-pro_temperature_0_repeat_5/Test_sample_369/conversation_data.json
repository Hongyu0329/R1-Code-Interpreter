    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the scansion for the Latin hexameter line: \"verum ubi equi atque hominis casu convenit imago.\"\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Basics of Hexameter\nA line of dactylic hexameter consists of six feet.\n*   The first four feet can be either a **dactyl** (one long syllable followed by two short syllables, — ∪ ∪) or a **spondee** (two long syllables, — —).\n*   The fifth foot is almost always a dactyl. A spondee in the fifth foot is rare.\n*   The sixth foot is always treated as a spondee. The final syllable is considered long by convention (*syllaba anceps*).\n*   We will represent dactyls with \"D\" and spondees with \"S\".\n\n### Step 2: Identify Vowel Quantities and Elisions\nFirst, we must determine the length (quantity) of each vowel and identify any elisions (where a vowel at the end of a word is dropped before a word starting with a vowel or 'h').\n\nThe line is: `verum ubi equi atque hominis casu convenit imago.`\n\n1.  **Elisions:**\n    *   `verum ubi`: The `-um` at the end of `verum` elides with the `u-` at the beginning of `ubi`. The line is scanned as `ver' ubi`.\n    *   `equi atque`: The `-i` at the end of `equi` elides with the `a-` at the beginning of `atque`. The line is scanned as `equ' atque`.\n    *   `convenit imago`: There is no elision here, as `convenit` ends with a consonant (`-t`).\n\n2.  **Vowel Quantities:**\n    *   `verum`: The `e` is long by nature (`vērus`).\n    *   `ubi`: Both the `u` and `i` are short.\n    *   `equi`: The `e` is short. The final `i` (`equī`) is naturally long, but it is elided.\n    *   `atque`: The `a` is long by position because it's followed by two consonants (`t` and `qu`). The `-que` ending is always short.\n    *   `hominis`: All three syllables are short.\n    *   `casu`: Both the `a` and the `u` are long by nature (`cāsū`).\n    *   `convenit`: `con-` is long by position. `-ve-` is short. `-nit` is short. The word scans as a dactyl (`— ∪ ∪`).\n    *   `imago`: The `i` is short. The `a` and `o` are long by nature (`imāgō`).\n\n### Step 3: Scan the Line Foot by Foot\n\nNow we assemble the feet based on the syllables and their quantities.\n\n**Line with elisions:** `vēr' ubi equ' atque hominis cāsū convenit imāgō`\n\n*   **Foot 1: `vēr' ubi`**\n    *   `vēr` (long) `u` (short) `bi` (short) = `— ∪ ∪`\n    *   This is a **Dactyl (D)**.\n\n*   **Foot 2: `equ' atque`**\n    *   The syllables are `e-quat-que`.\n    *   `e` (short) `quat` (long) `que` (short) = `∪ — ∪`.\n    *   This sequence presents a problem, as a hexameter foot cannot begin with a short syllable. This indicates the line is likely irregular or corrupt. However, to solve the puzzle, we must assume a poetic license. The most common \"fix\" for such a problem is to treat the initial short syllable as long (*metri gratia*, for the sake of the meter). If we treat the `e` as long (`ē`), we get:\n    *   `ē-quat-` = `— —`\n    *   This forms a **Spondee (S)**.\n\n*   **Foot 3: `que hominis`**\n    *   This foot begins with the leftover `-que` from `atque`.\n    *   The syllables are `que ho-mi-nis`. The syllable `-nis` is long by position because it is followed by the two consonants `c` and `s` from `casu`.\n    *   `que` (short) `ho` (short) `mi` (short) `nis` (long) = `∪ ∪ ∪ —`. This is also not a valid foot.\n    *   Again, we must assume a poetic license. The most likely solution is that `hominis` undergoes syncope (loss of an internal vowel) to become `hom'nis`.\n    *   The foot would then be `que hom'nis`. `que` (short) `hom'nis` (long). This still doesn't form a valid foot.\n    *   Given the repeated problems, the most logical approach is to identify the most plausible feet and see what remains. Let's work from the back.\n\n*   **Foot 6: `imāgō`**\n    *   The last two syllables are `mā-gō`.\n    *   `mā` (long) `gō` (long) = `— —`\n    *   This is a **Spondee (S)**.\n\n*   **Foot 5: `convenit i-`**\n    *   The fifth foot is expected to be a dactyl (`— ∪ ∪`).\n    *   The syllables before `māgō` are `con-ve-nit i-`.\n    *   `con` (long) `ve` (short) `nit` (short) = `— ∪ ∪`.\n    *   This is a perfect **Dactyl (D)**. This leaves the `i-` from `imago` stranded. This suggests a prodelision (elision of the initial vowel of the second word), where `convenit imago` is scanned as `convenit'mago`. This is a plausible poetic device.\n\n*   **Foot 4: `cāsū`**\n    *   `cā` (long) `sū` (long) = `— —`\n    *   This is a **Spondee (S)**.\n\n*   **Revisiting Feet 2 and 3:**\n    *   We have `D | ?? | ?? | S | D | S`.\n    *   The remaining words are `equi atque hominis`.\n    *   With elision, this is `e-quat-que ho-mi-nis`. The syllable `-nis` is long before `casu`.\n    *   Sequence: `∪ — ∪ ∪ ∪ —`. This cannot be divided into two valid feet.\n    *   The line as written is not a standard classical hexameter. To provide a complete scansion, we must assume significant poetic license. The most common pattern to fit the remaining space would be two spondees (S S). Although the syllables do not fit this pattern, it is the most probable intended structure for a line of this type.\n\n### Final Answer Construction\nBased on the analysis, the most plausible intended scansion, despite the metrical issues in the second and third feet, is:\n*   Foot 1: Dactyl (D)\n*   Foot 2: Spondee (S)\n*   Foot 3: Spondee (S)\n*   Foot 4: Spondee (S)\n*   Foot 5: Dactyl (D)\n*   Foot 6: Spondee (S)\n\nThis results in the pattern D S S S D S.\n\n<<<D S S S D S>>>"
