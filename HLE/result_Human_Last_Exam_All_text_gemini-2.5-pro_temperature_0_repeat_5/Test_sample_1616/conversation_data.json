    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**1. Understand the Core Concept: Trisyllabic Laxing (TSL)**\n\nTrisyllabic Laxing is a historical sound change in English. The rule states that a tense vowel (like the \"i\" in `divine` or the \"a\" in `sane`) becomes a lax vowel (like the \"i\" in `divinity` or the \"a\" in `sanity`) when it is in the antepenultimate syllable, which is the third syllable from the end of a word. For this rule to apply, a word must have at least three syllables.\n\n**2. Analyze Each Word Against the Rule**\n\nWe will examine each word to see if it fits the pattern of Trisyllabic Laxing. This involves checking its syllable count and comparing its vowel sound to a related base word.\n\n*   **derivative**:\n    *   Syllables: `de-riv-a-tive` (4 syllables).\n    *   Related Word: `derive` (pronounced /dɪˈraɪv/, with a tense /aɪ/ sound).\n    *   Analysis: In `derivative` (/dɪˈrɪvətɪv/), the corresponding vowel is in the syllable `riv`, which is the third from the end (ante-pen-ultimate). The tense /aɪ/ sound from `derive` has become a lax /ɪ/ sound.\n    *   Conclusion: This is a classic example of Trisyllabic Laxing. The word **has** undergone TSL.\n\n*   **serenity**:\n    *   Syllables: `se-ren-i-ty` (4 syllables).\n    *   Related Word: `serene` (pronounced /səˈriːn/, with a tense /iː/ sound, like \"ee\").\n    *   Analysis: In `serenity` (/səˈrɛnɪti/), the corresponding vowel is in the syllable `ren`, which is the third from the end. The tense /iː/ sound from `serene` has become a lax /ɛ/ sound (as in \"bed\").\n    *   Conclusion: This is another classic example of Trisyllabic Laxing. The word **has** undergone TSL.\n\n*   **gratitude**:\n    *   Syllables: `grat-i-tude` (3 syllables).\n    *   Related Word: `grateful` (pronounced /ˈɡreɪtfʊl/, with a tense /eɪ/ sound, as in \"late\").\n    *   Analysis: In `gratitude` (/ˈɡrætɪtjuːd/), the vowel is in the syllable `grat`, which is the third from the end. The tense /eɪ/ sound seen in `grateful` corresponds to the lax /æ/ sound (as in \"cat\") in `gratitude`.\n    *   Conclusion: This word also shows the effects of Trisyllabic Laxing. The word **has** undergone TSL.\n\n*   **southern**, **pleasant**, **shadow**:\n    *   Syllables: `south-ern` (2), `pleas-ant` (2), `shad-ow` (2).\n    *   Analysis: These three words are all disyllabic (they have only two syllables). By definition, Trisyllabic Laxing cannot apply to them because the rule requires a vowel to be in the third-to-last syllable, and these words don't have one.\n    *   Conclusion: None of these three words have undergone *Trisyllabic* Laxing.\n\n**3. Distinguish Among the Remaining Candidates**\n\nSince the question asks for a single answer, we must find a deeper reason to select one from `southern`, `pleasant`, and `shadow`. The key is to look at whether any laxing process occurred at all.\n\n*   **southern**: The base word `south` (/saʊθ/) has a tense vowel. The word `southern` (/ˈsʌðərn/) has a lax vowel. A laxing process did occur, but it was due to the following consonant cluster (`-thern`), not TSL.\n*   **pleasant**: The base word `please` (/pliːz/) has a tense vowel. The word `pleasant` (/ˈplɛzənt/) has a lax vowel. A laxing process did occur, but it was due to the following consonant cluster (`-sant`), not TSL.\n*   **shadow**: The related word is `shade` (/ʃeɪd/), which has a tense vowel. However, looking at the history, the Old English word for `shadow` (*sceadwe*) always had a short (lax) vowel. The word for `shade` (*sceadu*) also had a short vowel that only became long (tense) later in history. Therefore, the vowel in `shadow` was never tense to begin with. It did not \"undergo\" a laxing process because it was already lax.\n\n**4. Final Conclusion**\n\nWhile `southern` and `pleasant` did not undergo *Trisyllabic* Laxing, they did undergo other forms of vowel laxing. `shadow` is unique in this list because its vowel was never tense in its history, so it could not have undergone any laxing process at all. It is the most definitive answer.\n\n<<<shadow>>>"
