    "Here is the most memory-efficient C program to solve the problem.\n\n### C Program\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <ctype.h>\n\nint main() {\n    // Declare two character arrays to hold the strings.\n    // The maximum length is 100, so we need 101 bytes for each \n    // to include the null terminator ('\\0').\n    char s1[101];\n    char s2[101];\n\n    // Read the two strings from standard input.\n    scanf(\"%s\", s1);\n    scanf(\"%s\", s2);\n\n    // Loop through the strings. Since they are guaranteed to be the same length,\n    // we only need to check one for the null terminator.\n    // We use a 'char' type for the loop counter 'i' because it only needs to\n    // store values from 0 to 99. A char (1 byte) is more memory-efficient\n    // than an int (usually 4 bytes).\n    for (char i = 0; s1[i] != '\\0'; i++) {\n        // Get the lowercase version of the characters at the current position.\n        char char1_lower = tolower(s1[i]);\n        char char2_lower = tolower(s2[i]);\n\n        // Perform the comparison.\n        if (char1_lower < char2_lower) {\n            printf(\"-1\\n\");\n            return 0; // Exit as soon as the result is known.\n        }\n        if (char1_lower > char2_lower) {\n            printf(\"1\\n\");\n            return 0; // Exit as soon as the result is known.\n        }\n    }\n\n    // If the loop completes without finding any difference, the strings are equal.\n    printf(\"0\\n\");\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Memory Usage Calculation (m)\n\nThe total memory `m` used for variables in this program is calculated as follows:\n\n1.  **`char s1[101];`**: This is a character array to store the first string. It reserves space for 100 characters plus one null terminator. The size of a `char` is 1 byte.\n    *   Memory = 101 * 1 byte = **101 bytes**.\n2.  **`char s2[101];`**: This is a character array for the second string, with the same size requirements.\n    *   Memory = 101 * 1 byte = **101 bytes**.\n3.  **`char i;`**: This is the loop counter. Since the string length is at most 100, the counter `i` will go from 0 to 99. A `char` type, which can hold values from -128 to 127 (or 0 to 255 for `unsigned char`), is sufficient and uses only **1 byte**. This is more memory-efficient than using an `int`, which typically uses 4 bytes.\n4.  **`char char1_lower;`**: A temporary variable inside the loop to hold the lowercase version of a character from `s1`. It uses **1 byte**.\n5.  **`char char2_lower;`**: A temporary variable inside the loop to hold the lowercase version of a character from `s2`. It uses **1 byte**.\n\nTotal memory `m` is the sum of the memory used by all these variables:\nm = (memory for s1) + (memory for s2) + (memory for i) + (memory for char1_lower) + (memory for char2_lower)\nm = 101 + 101 + 1 + 1 + 1 = **205 bytes**\n\n<<<205>>>"
