    "To find the greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of the polynomial matrices:\nP1 = [[s^2 + s, -s], [-s^2 - 1, s^2]]\nP2 = [[s, 0], [-s - 1, 1]]\n\nWe can use the Euclidean algorithm by performing elementary row operations on the stacked matrix M = [P1; P2] or M = [P2; P1]. The goal is to reduce this matrix to the form [D; 0], where D is a GCRD. The elementary row operations are:\n1.  Swapping two rows.\n2.  Multiplying a row by a non-zero constant.\n3.  Adding a polynomial multiple of one row to another.\n\nLet's form the matrix M by stacking P2 on top of P1:\nM =\n[ s,      0    ]  (Row 1)\n[ -s-1,   1    ]  (Row 2)\n[ s^2+s,  -s   ]  (Row 3)\n[ -s^2-1, s^2  ]  (Row 4)\n\n**Step 1: Simplify the first column.**\nWe can simplify the matrix by adding Row 1 to Row 2.\n*   R2' = R2 + R1 = [-s-1+s, 1+0] = [-1, 1]\n\nNow the matrix is:\nM' =\n[ s,      0    ]\n[ -1,     1    ]\n[ s^2+s,  -s   ]\n[ -s^2-1, s^2  ]\n\n**Step 2: Use the new Row 2 (R2') to eliminate the first element in other rows.**\n*   R1' = R1 + s*R2' = [s + s(-1), 0 + s(1)] = [0, s]\n*   R3' = R3 + (s^2+s)*R2' = [s^2+s + (s^2+s)(-1), -s + (s^2+s)(1)] = [0, s^2]\n*   R4' = R4 - (s^2+1)*R2' = [-s^2-1 - (s^2+1)(-1), s^2 - (s^2+1)(1)] = [-s^2-1 + s^2+1, s^2 - s^2-1] = [0, -1]\n\nThe matrix becomes:\nM'' =\n[ 0,      s    ]\n[ -1,     1    ]\n[ 0,      s^2  ]\n[ 0,      -1   ]\n\n**Step 3: Reorder the rows and simplify the second column.**\nLet's reorder the rows to group the non-zero elements in the first column:\nM''' =\n[ -1,     1    ]  (Row a)\n[ 0,      -1   ]  (Row b)\n[ 0,      s    ]  (Row c)\n[ 0,      s^2  ]  (Row d)\n\nNow, use Row b to eliminate the second element in the other rows.\n*   R_a' = R_a + R_b = [-1, 1 + (-1)] = [-1, 0]\n*   R_c' = R_c + s*R_b = [0, s + s(-1)] =\n*   R_d' = R_d + s^2*R_b = [0, s^2 + s^2(-1)] =\n\nThe final matrix is:\nM_final =\n[ -1,     0    ]\n[ 0,      -1   ]\n[ 0,      0    ]\n[ 0,      0    ]\n\nThe non-zero part of this matrix is the GCRD.\nD = [[-1, 0], [0, -1]]\n\nThe determinant of D is (-1)(-1) - (0)(0) = 1. Since the determinant is a non-zero constant, the matrix D is unimodular. This means that the original matrices P1 and P2 are right coprime.\n\nAny unimodular matrix is a valid GCRD for right coprime matrices. For instance, the identity matrix I = [,] is also a GCRD. However, the matrix derived directly from the Euclidean algorithm is the one shown above.\n\n<<<[[ -1, 0 ], [ 0, -1 ]]>>>"
