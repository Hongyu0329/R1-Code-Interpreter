    "When the ketal represented by the SMILES string `CC12COC(OC1)(OC2)C1=CC=CC=C1` is added to an acidic aqueous solution (0.01 M TFA in water), it undergoes hydrolysis. This reaction cleaves the ketal protecting group, yielding the original ketone and alcohol from which it was formed.\n\nThe products of this hydrolysis reaction are:\n1.  **Acetophenone**: This is the ketone component.\n    *   Chemical Formula: C₈H₈O\n    *   Molar Mass: Approximately 120.15 g/mol\n    *   SMILES String: `CC(=O)C1=CC=CC=C1`\n2.  **1,2,4-Butanetriol**: This is the alcohol component (a triol).\n    *   Chemical Formula: C₄H₁₀O₃\n    *   Molar Mass: Approximately 106.12 g/mol\n    *   SMILES String: `OCC(O)CCO`\n\nComparing the molar masses, acetophenone (120.15 g/mol) has a higher molar mass than 1,2,4-butanetriol (106.12 g/mol).\n\n<<<CC(=O)C1=CC=CC=C1>>>"
