    "In Major League Baseball, the number of Triple Crown winners varies depending on the inclusion of different leagues and eras. In the American and National Leagues since RBIs became an official statistic in 1920, 10 players have won the batting Triple Crown a total of 12 times. The Triple Crown requires a player to lead their league in batting average, home runs, and runs batted in (RBIs) in the same season.\n\nIf you include earlier baseball leagues and the Negro Leagues, the total number of players to have won a Triple Crown is higher. Including the Negro Leagues, there have been 27 or 28 Triple Crown winners, depending on the source. Four players have won the award multiple times.\n\nThe winners in the American and National Leagues are:\n*   **Paul Hines** (1878, Providence Grays, NL)\n*   **Tip O'Neill** (1887, St. Louis Browns, AA)\n*   **Hugh Duffy** (1894, Boston Beaneaters, NL)\n*   **Nap Lajoie** (1901, Philadelphia Athletics, AL)\n*   **Ty Cobb** (1909, Detroit Tigers, AL)\n*   **Heinie Zimmerman** (1912, Chicago Cubs, NL)\n*   **Rogers Hornsby** (1922 & 1925, St. Louis Cardinals, NL)\n*   **Chuck Klein** (1933, Philadelphia Phillies, NL)\n*   **Jimmie Foxx** (1933, Philadelphia Athletics, AL)\n*   **Lou Gehrig** (1934, New York Yankees, AL)\n*   **Joe Medwick** (1937, St. Louis Cardinals, NL)\n*   **Ted Williams** (1942 & 1947, Boston Red Sox, AL)\n*   **Mickey Mantle** (1956, New York Yankees, AL)\n*   **Frank Robinson** (1966, Baltimore Orioles, AL)\n*   **Carl Yastrzemski** (1967, Boston Red Sox, AL)\n*   **Miguel Cabrera** (2012, Detroit Tigers, AL)\n\nThe most recent player to win the Triple Crown was Miguel Cabrera in 2012, ending a 45-year gap since the previous winner. Ted Williams and Rogers Hornsby are the only two players in AL/NL history to have won the Triple Crown twice.\n\nIncluding the Negro Leagues adds several more winners, with Oscar Charleston winning three times and Josh Gibson winning twice.\n\n<<<17>>>"
