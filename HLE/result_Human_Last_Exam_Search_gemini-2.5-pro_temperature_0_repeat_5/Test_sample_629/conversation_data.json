    "The minimal grid number for a trefoil knot is 5. The grid number, also known as the arc index, is the size of the smallest square grid on which the knot can be represented. Nontrivial knots, such as the trefoil, first appear on 5x5 grids.\n\nThe grid number is the same for a knot and its mirror image. Therefore, both the left-hand and right-hand trefoil knots have a minimal grid number of 5. A study of grid diagrams found that for a grid number of 5, there are a total of 10 diagrams that form a trefoil knot, which includes both left- and right-handed versions.\n\nResearch that illustrates the minimal grid diagrams for the right-hand trefoil knot shows there are 5 such distinct diagrams. Since the properties of grid diagrams are the same for a knot and its mirror image, the left-hand trefoil knot also has 5 minimal grid diagrams.\n\n<<<E>>>"
