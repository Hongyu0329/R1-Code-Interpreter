    "The latest battle depicted in a painting by Lady Butler is the **Charge at Huj**, which took place on **November 8, 1917**.\n\nThe painting is titled *The Charge of the Warwickshire and Worcestershire Yeomanry at Huj*. This engagement was part of the Sinai and Palestine Campaign during the First World War. The charge was carried out by the British 5th Mounted Brigade against a rearguard position of German, Austrian, and Turkish artillery and infantry. It is considered one of the last great cavalry charges in British military history.\n\nOther battles from the First World War painted by Lady Butler include the Retreat from Mons in 1914 and the Action of Agagia in February 1916. However, the Charge at Huj in November 1917 is the latest of these historical events that she depicted.\n\n<<<The Charge at Huj>>>"
