    "The reaction of (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane with potassium tert-butoxide in tert-butyl alcohol is an E2 elimination reaction. For an E2 reaction to occur in a cyclohexane ring, the leaving group (bromine) and a hydrogen atom on an adjacent carbon (a β-hydrogen) must be in an anti-periplanar conformation, which means they must both be in axial positions and on opposite sides of the ring (one pointing up, one pointing down).\n\nThe starting material, (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane, is a trans-disubstituted cyclohexane. It exists as an equilibrium between two chair conformations:\n1.  A more stable conformer where both the bromo group and the methyl group are in equatorial positions.\n2.  A less stable conformer where both groups are in axial positions.\n\nThe E2 elimination must proceed through the less stable diaxial conformer because only in this conformation is the bromine atom in the required axial position.\n\nIn the diaxial conformation, let's consider the bromine at C1 to be axial. The methyl group at C2 is also axial. We now look for axial β-hydrogens:\n*   **At carbon C2:** The methyl group is in the axial position, which means the hydrogen on C2 is in the equatorial position. Since there is no axial hydrogen on C2, elimination to form a double bond between C1 and C2 (to give 1-methylcyclohexene, the Zaitsev product) cannot occur.\n*   **At carbon C6:** This carbon has two hydrogens. One is axial and one is equatorial. The axial hydrogen at C6 is anti-periplanar to the axial bromine at C1.\n\nBecause only the axial hydrogen at C6 is available for elimination, the potassium tert-butoxide (a strong, bulky base) will abstract this proton. This results in the formation of a double bond between C1 and C6.\n\nTherefore, the sole product of this reaction is **3-methylcyclohexene**.\n\n<<<3-methylcyclohexene>>>"
