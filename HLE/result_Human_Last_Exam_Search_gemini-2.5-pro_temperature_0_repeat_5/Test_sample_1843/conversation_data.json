    "The search results confirm the general theory I used. Specifically, a character $\\chi$ modulo $N = p_1^{a_1} \\cdots p_r^{a_r}$ is primitive if and only if it can be uniquely written as a product of primitive characters $\\chi_i$ modulo $p_i^{a_i}$. The order of $\\chi$ is the least common multiple of the orders of the $\\chi_i$. My approach of breaking down the problem into finding the number of appropriate primitive characters for each prime power factor and then combining them is correct. The search results did not provide a direct formula for the number of primitive characters of a specific conductor and order, but they reinforce the foundational principles I have relied on. My calculations for the number of primitive characters of specific orders for each prime power factor are based on standard results in number theory, which the search results also allude to. Therefore, I am confident in my step-by-step derivation.\n\nThe final calculation is as follows:\n$N = 36036 = 2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 13$.\nLet $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\chi_3 \\chi_4 \\chi_5$ be a primitive character modulo $N$. This requires each $\\chi_i$ to be a primitive character modulo the corresponding prime power factor of $N$.\nThe order of $\\chi$ is $\\text{lcm}(o(\\chi_1), o(\\chi_2), o(\\chi_3), o(\\chi_4), o(\\chi_5))$, which must be 6.\n\nThe number of choices for each primitive character $\\chi_i$ such that its order divides 6 are:\n*   **Modulo 4 ($2^2$)**: There is 1 primitive character, and its order is 2. This order divides 6. So there is 1 choice for $\\chi_1$.\n*   **Modulo 9 ($3^2$)**: There are 4 primitive characters. Their orders are 3 (two characters) and 6 (two characters). All these orders divide 6. So there are 4 choices for $\\chi_2$.\n*   **Modulo 7**: There are 5 primitive characters. Their orders are 2 (one character), 3 (two characters), and 6 (two characters). All these orders divide 6. So there are 5 choices for $\\chi_3$.\n*   **Modulo 11**: The orders of primitive characters are 2, 5, and 10. The only order that divides 6 is 2. There is 1 such character. So there is 1 choice for $\\chi_4$.\n*   **Modulo 13**: The orders of primitive characters are 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12. The orders that divide 6 are 2, 3, and 6. The number of such characters is $1 + 2 + 2 = 5$. So there are 5 choices for $\\chi_5$.\n\nThe total number of tuples $(\\chi_1, \\chi_2, \\chi_3, \\chi_4, \\chi_5)$ of primitive characters where each $o(\\chi_i)$ divides 6 is $1 \\times 4 \\times 5 \\times 1 \\times 5 = 100$.\n\nNow, we must verify that for every such tuple, the least common multiple of the orders is exactly 6.\nLet the orders be $(k_1, k_2, k_3, k_4, k_5)$.\n*   $k_1 = 2$.\n*   $k_2 \\in \\{3, 6\\}$.\n*   $k_3 \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$.\n*   $k_4 = 2$.\n*   $k_5 \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$.\n\nThe lcm must be a multiple of $k_1=2$ and a multiple of $k_2 \\in \\{3, 6\\}$. Since $k_2$ is always a multiple of 3, the lcm is a multiple of $\\text{lcm}(2, 3) = 6$.\nSince all individual orders divide 6, their lcm must also divide 6.\nTherefore, the lcm is exactly 6 for any combination of the chosen characters.\n\nThe number of such characters is the product of the number of choices for each component, which is 100.\n\n<<<100>>>"
