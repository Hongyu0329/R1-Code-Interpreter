    "In the dwarf cuttlefish (*Sepia bandensis*), the brain regions that lie adjacent and posterior to the palliovisceral lobe are the **posterior chromatophore lobes** and the **fin lobes**.\n\nThe brain of the dwarf cuttlefish, like other cephalopods, is organized into several masses, with the palliovisceral lobe being a key component of the posterior subesophageal mass (PSEM). This mass is situated in the posterior region of the subesophageal brain.\n\nStudies on the brain of *Sepia* species, the genus to which the dwarf cuttlefish belongs, have identified several lobes within the PSEM. These include the palliovisceral lobe, the posterior chromatophore lobes, the fin lobes, and the magnocellular lobes. The palliovisceral lobe itself is involved in controlling locomotion, such as escape movements and inking.\n\nAnatomical studies and diagrams of the *Sepia* brain show the relative positioning of these lobes. The posterior chromatophore lobes and the fin lobes are located within the same posterior subesophageal mass as the palliovisceral lobe and are situated posterior to it. Specifically, the posterior chromatophore lobes are involved in controlling the chromatophores on the mantle, while the fin lobes innervate the muscles of the fins. The entire posterior aspect of the brain is encased in rigid cartilage.\n\n<<<The brain regions that lie adjacent posteriorly to the palliovisceral lobe in the dwarf cuttlefish are the posterior chromatophore lobes and the fin lobes."
