    "In the framework of renormalization group theory, the scaling exponent α for the specific heat is determined using the epsilon (ε) expansion near the upper critical dimension. For a broad class of systems, including those in the Ising universality class, the upper critical dimension is d_c = 4. The ε-expansion is a perturbative calculation in the small parameter ε = 4 - d, where d is the spatial dimension.\n\nThe critical exponents are related through hyperscaling relations. The exponent α is connected to the correlation length exponent ν and the spatial dimension d by the relation: α = 2 - νd.\n\nFor a general n-vector model, which describes systems with an n-component order parameter, the correlation length exponent ν can be calculated as a series in ε. To the first order in ε, it is given by:\n\nν = 1/2 + [ (n+2) / (4(n+8)) ] * ε + O(ε²)\n\nSubstituting this expression and d = 4 - ε into the hyperscaling relation yields the first-order expression for α:\n\nα = 2 - (1/2 + [ (n+2) / (4(n+8)) ] * ε) * (4 - ε)\nα = [ (4-n) / (2(n+8)) ] * ε + O(ε²)\n\nWhile the problem does not specify the number of components 'n' for the order parameter, a common case to consider is the Ising model, for which n=1. For the Ising model, the expression for α simplifies to:\n\nα = ( (4-1) / (2(1+8)) ) * ε + O(ε²) = (3 / 18) * ε + O(ε²) = (1/6) * ε + O(ε²)\n\nThe question specifies a spatial dimension of d=3, which corresponds to ε = 4 - 3 = 1. It is important to note that using ε=1 is a significant extrapolation from the ε → 0 limit where the expansion is formally justified. However, within this approximation, the numerical value for α is:\n\nα ≈ 1/6\n\nThus, to the leading order in the epsilon expansion, the scaling exponent α for the specific heat in a three-dimensional system is 1/6.\n\n<<<1/6>>>"
