    "In a surface code, the number of logical qubits that can be encoded is determined by the topology of the surface, specifically the number of holes. For a planar surface code patch, which can be thought of as a surface with a boundary, introducing holes increases its capacity to store logical information.\n\nA standard planar surface code with no holes encodes a single logical qubit. A clear rule for adding logical qubits is that for a planar lattice with *b* closed holes, the code can encode *k = b* logical qubits. Therefore, a single patch of surface code with two holes can encode two logical qubits.\n\nWhen using multiple patches, the total number of logical qubits is simply the sum of the logical qubits in each individual patch. While techniques like lattice surgery are required to perform operations between these qubits, the total number of encoded qubits is additive.\n\nFollowing this, the calculation is straightforward:\n*   Number of logical qubits in the first patch with two holes = 2\n*   Number of logical qubits in the second patch with two holes = 2\n*   Total number of logical qubits = 2 + 2 = 4\n\nTherefore, at most, four logical qubits can be encoded in two patches of surface code with two holes each.\n\n<<<4>>>"
