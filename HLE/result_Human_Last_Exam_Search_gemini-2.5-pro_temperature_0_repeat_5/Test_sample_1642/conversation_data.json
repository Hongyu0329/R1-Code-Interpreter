    "The problem of placing `m` white queens and `m` black queens on a 16x16 chessboard without any queen attacking another is equivalent to the problem of placing `2m` queens on a 16x16 board under the same non-attacking condition. The color of the queens does not alter the fundamental constraints of the N-Queens problem.\n\nThe N-Queens problem seeks to determine the maximum number of queens that can be placed on an N×N chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other. It is a well-established fact that for an N×N board, it is possible to place N non-attacking queens.\n\nIn this specific case, the chessboard size is 16x16, meaning N=16. Therefore, the maximum total number of non-attacking queens that can be placed on the board is 16.\n\nThe total number of queens in this problem is the sum of the white and black queens, which is `m + m = 2m`.\n\nTo find the maximum value of `m`, we set the total number of queens equal to the maximum possible for a 16x16 board:\n`2m = 16`\n\nSolving for `m`, we get:\n`m = 16 / 2`\n`m = 8`\n\nThus, the maximum number `m` is 8, allowing for 8 white queens and 8 black queens to coexist on a 16x16 chessboard without attacking each other.\n\n<<<8>>>"
