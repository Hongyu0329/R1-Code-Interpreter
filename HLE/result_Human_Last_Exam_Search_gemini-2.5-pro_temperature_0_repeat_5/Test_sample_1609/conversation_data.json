    "The maximal number of prime implicants for a Boolean function of n variables, denoted as a(n), is given by the formula 2^(n-1). This formula is derived from arranging the minterms in a Karnaugh map in a checkerboard pattern, which prevents the combination of adjacent minterms into larger groups.\n\nFor a Boolean function with 4 variables (n=4), the calculation is as follows:\n\na(4) = 2^(4-1) = 2^3 = 8.\n\nTherefore, the maximal number of prime implicants for a Boolean function of 4 variables is 8. An example of a function that achieves this maximum is the 4-variable XOR function (A ⊕ B ⊕ C ⊕ D), which has 8 essential prime implicants. Since all essential prime implicants are also prime implicants, this demonstrates a function with 8 prime implicants.\n\n<<<8>>>"
