    "There are five wallpaper groups with a point group of order 2.\n\nThe symmetry of a two-dimensional repeating pattern is classified by one of the 17 wallpaper groups. Each wallpaper group is associated with a point group, which describes the rotational and reflectional symmetries that leave at least one point fixed. The order of a group refers to the number of symmetry operations it contains. A point group of order 2, therefore, has two such operations: the identity operation and one other.\n\nIn two dimensions, there are two types of crystallographic point groups of order 2:\n*   **C₂**: This group contains the identity and a 180-degree rotation (a rotation of order 2).\n*   **D₁**: This group contains the identity and a single reflection.\n\nThe 17 wallpaper groups can be classified based on their associated point group. The wallpaper groups that have a point group of order 2 are:\n\n*   **p2**: This group has a point group of C₂. It features 180-degree rotations but no reflections or glide reflections.\n*   **pm**: This group has a point group of D₁. Its symmetries include reflections in parallel axes.\n*   **pg**: This group also has a point group of D₁. It contains glide reflections but no rotations.\n*   **cm**: This group's point group is D₁. It has reflections and glide reflections, where some glide-reflection axes are not reflection axes.\n*   **pgg**: This group has a point group of D₂. It contains two rotation centres of order two and glide reflections in two perpendicular directions.\n\nBased on a detailed analysis of the 17 wallpaper groups, the following five have a point group of order 2: p2, pm, pg, cm, and pgg.\n\n<<<5>>>"
