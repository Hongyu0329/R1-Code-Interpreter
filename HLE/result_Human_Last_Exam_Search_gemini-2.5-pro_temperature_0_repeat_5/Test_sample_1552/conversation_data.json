    "The second coefficient in the heat kernel expansion of the spectral action for a massless gauged Dirac spinor field is denoted as `a₂`. The spectral action is constructed from the heat kernel associated with the square of the Dirac operator, `D²`. The Dirac operator `D` couples the spinor field to both the gravitational background (via the spin connection) and the gauge field `A`.\n\nThe coefficient `a₂` is a local geometric invariant built from the curvature of the spacetime and the field strength of the gauge field. For a Dirac spinor in four dimensions, the operator is `D²`, and the coefficient `a₂(x)` is an endomorphism on the spinor bundle at point `x`. Its trace, `Tr(a₂(x))`, is the quantity that appears in the spectral action.\n\nThe standard result for the trace of the second Seeley-DeWitt coefficient `a₂` for the square of the massless gauged Dirac operator in 4-dimensional Euclidean space is given by:\n\n`Tr(a₂(x)) = (1/ (16π²)) * tr_V [ (5/6) F_μν F^μν - (1/30) R_μν R^μν - (1/60) R_μνρσ R^μνρσ + (1/15) R² ]`\n\nA more common expression found in the literature, for instance in works by Avramidi and others, after using the Gauss-Bonnet topological identity (`R_μνρσ R^μνρσ - 4R_μν R^μν + R²` is a total derivative) to simplify the gravitational terms, gives the coefficient `a₂(x)` as an endomorphism:\n\n`a₂(x) = tr_G [ (1/12) F_μν F^μν + (1/240) R_μνρσ R^μνρσ - (1/240) R_μν R^μν - (1/144) R² ] ⊗ I_S`\n\nwhere:\n*   `x` is a point on the 4-dimensional manifold.\n*   `F_μν` is the field strength tensor of the gauge field.\n*   `R` is the scalar curvature of the spacetime.\n*   `R_μν` is the Ricci curvature tensor.\n*   `R_μνρσ` is the Riemann curvature tensor.\n*   `tr_G` denotes the trace over the gauge group's Lie algebra. `F_μν F^μν` is understood as `tr_G(F_μν F^μν)`.\n*   `I_S` is the identity matrix in the 4-dimensional spinor space.\n\nThe full coefficient, which is a scalar density, is obtained by taking the trace over the spinor space as well, which multiplies the expression by `tr_S(I_S) = 4`.\n\n<<<The second coefficient in the heat kernel expansion for the square of the massless gauged Dirac operator in four dimensions, `a₂(x)`, is given by the endomorphism:\n`a₂(x) = tr_G [ (1/12) F_μν F^μν + (1/240) R_μνρσ R^μνρσ - (1/240) R_μν R^μν - (1/144) R² ] ⊗ I_S`\nwhere `F_μν` is the gauge field strength, `R`, `R_μν`, `R_μνρσ` are the scalar, Ricci, and Riemann curvature tensors respectively, `tr_G` is the trace over the gauge group, and `I_S` is the identity on the spinor space.>>>"
