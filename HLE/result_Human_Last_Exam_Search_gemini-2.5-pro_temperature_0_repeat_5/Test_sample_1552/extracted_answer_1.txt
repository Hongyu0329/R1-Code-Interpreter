The second coefficient in the heat kernel expansion for the square of the massless gauged Dirac operator in four dimensions, `a₂(x)`, is given by the endomorphism:
`a₂(x) = tr_G [ (1/12) F_μν F^μν + (1/240) R_μνρσ R^μνρσ - (1/240) R_μν R^μν - (1/144) R² ] ⊗ I_S`
where `F_μν` is the gauge field strength, `R`, `R_μν`, `R_μνρσ` are the scalar, Ricci, and Riemann curvature tensors respectively, `tr_G` is the trace over the gauge group, and `I_S` is the identity on the spinor space.
