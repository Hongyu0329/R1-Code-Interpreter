The approximate number of non-Clifford gates required to produce a single logical non-Clifford gate on a distance-3 surface code is about 15. For a distance-5 surface code with a high 1% physical error rate, this number increases dramatically to several hundred or even over a thousand due to the need for multiple rounds of magic state distillation.
