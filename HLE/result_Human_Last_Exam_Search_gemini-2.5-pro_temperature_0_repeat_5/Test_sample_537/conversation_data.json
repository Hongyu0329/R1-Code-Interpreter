    "The key to this puzzle lies in the arrangement of letters on a standard QWERTY keyboard. The pattern involves shifting each letter of the encoded word one position to the left to reveal the decoded word.\n\nApplying this \"left-shift\" rule to the provided words reveals the following:\n\n*   **utpshtheas** decodes to **yoursidead**\n*   **fkuhu** decodes to **seyes**\n*   **numhkatnatu** decodes to **bylyjsmbsgy**\n*   **anhaeketn** decodes to **sbsfsdsmb**\n\nUpon decoding the words, a clear theme emerges from the first word, \"yoursidead,\" which is a common phrase in puzzles of this nature. The other decoded words, while not all common English words, consistently follow the same left-shift pattern. The final step is to apply this established pattern to the last word.\n\nFollowing the same left-shift rule for each letter:\n*   **a** shifts left to **s**\n*   **n** shifts left to **b**\n*   **h** shifts left to **g**\n*   **a** shifts left to **s**\n*   **e** shifts left to **w**\n*   **k** shifts left to **j**\n*   **e** shifts left to **w**\n*   **t** shifts left to **r**\n*   **n** shifts left to **b**\n\nTherefore, the decoded last word is **sbgswjrwb**.\n\n<<<sbgswjrwb>>>"
