    "The problem asks for the minimum total number of vertices in a collection of bipartite graphs whose edges cover all the edges of the complete graph \\( K_{35} \\). This is a known problem in graph theory, and the quantity to be determined is often called the **biclique cover size** of the complete graph \\( K_n \\), denoted as \\(bc(K_n)\\).\n\nA biclique is a complete bipartite graph. It can be shown that for covering the edges of a complete graph, one can restrict the bipartite graphs to be bicliques without loss of generality. The \"number of vertices in a family of graphs\" is interpreted as the sum of the number of vertices over all graphs in the family. If a biclique has parts \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\), its vertex set is \\(X \\cup Y\\), and its size is defined as \\(|X| + |Y|\\).\n\nThe value of \\(bc(K_n)\\) is given by a formula that depends on the value of \\(n\\) relative to powers of 2. The formula, established by Fishburn and Hammer, is as follows:\n\nLet \\(m = \\lceil \\log_2 n \\rceil\\).\n- If \\(n = 2^m\\), then \\(bc(K_n) = mn\\).\n- If \\(2^{m-1} < n < 2^m\\), let \\(k = n - 2^{m-1}\\). Then \\(bc(K_n) = (m-1)n + k\\).\n\nFor the given problem, \\(n = 35\\).\n\n1.  First, we determine the value of \\(m\\):\n    \\(m = \\lceil \\log_2 35 \\rceil\\).\n    Since \\(2^5 = 32\\) and \\(2^6 = 64\\), we have \\(5 < \\log_2 35 < 6\\).\n    Therefore, \\(m = 6\\).\n\n2.  Next, we check which case of the formula applies.\n    The condition is \\(2^{6-1} < 35 < 2^6\\), which is \\(32 < 35 < 64\\). This is true, so we use the second case of the formula.\n\n3.  Now, we calculate \\(k\\):\n    \\(k = n - 2^{m-1} = 35 - 2^{6-1} = 35 - 2^5 = 35 - 32 = 3\\).\n\n4.  Finally, we apply the formula for \\(bc(K_{35})\\):\n    \\(bc(K_{35}) = (m-1)n + k\\)\n    \\(bc(K_{35}) = (6-1) \\times 35 + 3\\)\n    \\(bc(K_{35}) = 5 \\times 35 + 3\\)\n    \\(bc(K_{35}) = 175 + 3 = 178\\).\n\nThus, the minimum number of vertices in a family of bipartite graphs covering all the edges of \\( K_{35} \\) is 178.\n\n<<<178>>>"
