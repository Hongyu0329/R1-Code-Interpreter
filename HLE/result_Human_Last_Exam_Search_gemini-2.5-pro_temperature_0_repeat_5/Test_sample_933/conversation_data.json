    "The most common and efficient method for synthesizing Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF4) is by the direct reaction of xenon and fluorine gas. This process involves heating a mixture of xenon and fluorine, typically in a 1:5 molar ratio, within a nickel container. The nickel vessel is used because it forms a protective, non-reactive layer of nickel(II) fluoride on its surface.\n\nThe reaction is typically carried out at a temperature of 400°C and elevated pressure, such as 6 atmospheres. While the temperature can range from 350°C to 450°C, 400°C is the most frequently cited temperature for efficient production. At temperatures that are too low, the formation of xenon difluoride (XeF2) is favored, whereas higher temperatures and a larger excess of fluorine favor the formation of xenon hexafluoride (XeF6).\n\nOther methods exist, such as using an electric discharge at low temperatures or photochemical synthesis, but these can result in significant contamination with other xenon fluorides. A method for producing XeF2 involves trapping the product at -78°C to prevent its further fluorination into XeF4, indicating that -78°C is not a production temperature for xenon tetrafluoride. Therefore, based on the established and efficient synthesis methods, 400°C is the standard temperature.\n\n<<<B>>>"
