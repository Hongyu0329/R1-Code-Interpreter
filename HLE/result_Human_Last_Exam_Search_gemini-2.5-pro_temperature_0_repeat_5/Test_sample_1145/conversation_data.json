    "To determine the probability that a particle in a one-dimensional box is located in the interval from 0.495a to 0.505a for the n=2 state, we must integrate the probability density function, |ψ(x)|², over this interval.\n\nThe normalized wave function for a particle in a 1D box is given by:\nψn(x) = √(2/a) * sin(nπx/a)\n\nFor the n=2 state (the first excited state), the wave function is:\nψ₂(x) = √(2/a) * sin(2πx/a)\n\nThe probability density, P(x), is the square of the wave function:\nP(x) = |ψ₂(x)|² = (2/a) * sin²(2πx/a)\n\nThe probability of finding the particle in the interval [0.495a, 0.505a] is the integral of the probability density over this range:\nP = ∫ [from 0.495a to 0.505a] (2/a) * sin²(2πx/a) dx\n\nTo solve this integral, we use the trigonometric identity sin²(θ) = (1 - cos(2θ))/2. In our case, θ = 2πx/a, so 2θ = 4πx/a.\n\nP = (2/a) ∫ [from 0.495a to 0.505a] (1/2) * (1 - cos(4πx/a)) dx\nP = (1/a) [x - (a/4π)sin(4πx/a)] evaluated from 0.495a to 0.505a\n\nNow, we substitute the limits of integration:\nP = (1/a) * [(0.505a - (a/4π)sin(4π(0.505a)/a)) - (0.495a - (a/4π)sin(4π(0.495a)/a))]\nP = (1/a) * [0.01a - (a/4π)(sin(2.02π) - sin(1.98π))]\nP = 0.01 - (1/4π)(sin(2.02π) - sin(1.98π))\n\nUsing the properties of the sine function, sin(2π + x) = sin(x) and sin(2π - x) = -sin(x), we can simplify the expression:\nsin(2.02π) = sin(2π + 0.02π) = sin(0.02π)\nsin(1.98π) = sin(2π - 0.02π) = -sin(0.02π)\n\nSubstituting these back into the equation for P:\nP = 0.01 - (1/4π)(sin(0.02π) - (-sin(0.02π)))\nP = 0.01 - (1/4π)(2sin(0.02π))\nP = 0.01 - (1/2π)sin(0.02π)\n\nNow, we can calculate the numerical value:\nP ≈ 0.01 - (1 / (2 * 3.14159)) * sin(0.06283)\nP ≈ 0.01 - 0.159155 * 0.062791\nP ≈ 0.01 - 0.00999342\nP ≈ 0.00000658\n\nThe probability is approximately 6.58 x 10⁻⁶. This very low probability is expected, as the interval is centered around x = a/2, which is a node for the n=2 state, meaning the probability of finding the particle at exactly this point is zero.\n\n<<<6.58e-6>>>"
