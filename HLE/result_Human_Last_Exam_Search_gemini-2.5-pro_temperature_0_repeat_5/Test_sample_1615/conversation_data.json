    "The problem asks for the maximum number of colors needed for a proper vertex coloring of a graph $G$ with 12345 vertices, with the condition that $G$ is not a complete graph. The number of colors needed for a proper vertex coloring of a graph is called its chromatic number, denoted $\\chi(G)$. We are looking for the maximum possible value of $\\chi(G)$ for a non-complete graph with $n=12345$ vertices.\n\nFirst, let's establish an upper bound for the chromatic number of such a graph. A complete graph with $n$ vertices, denoted $K_n$, requires $n$ colors, as every vertex is connected to every other vertex. For any graph $G$ with $n$ vertices that is not a complete graph, there must exist at least one pair of vertices, say $u$ and $v$, that are not adjacent. Because they are not connected, $u$ and $v$ can be assigned the same color in a proper coloring.\n\nWe can construct a coloring with at most $n-1$ colors. By identifying the non-adjacent vertices $u$ and $v$ into a single new vertex, we form a new graph with $n-1$ vertices. This new graph can be colored with at most $n-1$ colors (one for each vertex in the worst case). This coloring provides a valid coloring for the original graph $G$, where $u$ and $v$ share the same color. Thus, for any graph $G$ with $n$ vertices that is not complete, its chromatic number is at most $n-1$.\n\nNext, we need to determine if this upper bound of $n-1$ can be achieved. Consider a graph $G$ constructed by taking a complete graph on $n-1$ vertices, $K_{n-1}$, and adding a single isolated vertex.\n*   This graph has $n$ vertices.\n*   It is not a complete graph because the isolated vertex is not connected to any other vertices.\n*   The subgraph $K_{n-1}$ requires $n-1$ colors for a proper coloring.\n*   The isolated vertex can be colored with any of these $n-1$ colors.\n*   Therefore, the chromatic number of this graph is $n-1$.\n\nFor the specific case of a graph with $n=12345$ vertices, this construction yields a non-complete graph with a chromatic number of $12345 - 1 = 12344$.\n\nThis result is also supported by Brooks's Theorem, which states that for any connected graph $G$, the chromatic number $\\chi(G)$ is at most its maximum degree $\\Delta(G)$, unless $G$ is a complete graph or an odd cycle. In the case of a complete graph $K_n$, $\\chi(K_n) = n$ and $\\Delta(K_n) = n-1$, so $\\chi(K_n) = \\Delta(K_n) + 1$. For any non-complete graph, the chromatic number cannot exceed its number of vertices, and as shown, cannot exceed $n-1$.\n\nSince we have found a graph that is not complete and has a chromatic number of $n-1$, the maximum number of colors required is $n-1$.\n\nGiven $n = 12345$, the maximum number of colors is $12345 - 1 = 12344$.\n\n<<<12344>>>"
