    "The exact value of the angle $\\alpha$ for the A($\\alpha$)-stability of the BDF4 numerical scheme is determined by the boundary of its stability region. The boundary is described by the root locus curve, and the angle $\\alpha$ is the angle of the tangent from the origin to this curve.\n\nThe stability of linear multistep methods, such as the Backward Differentiation Formulas (BDF), is analyzed by applying the method to the test equation $y' = \\lambda y$. This leads to a stability polynomial whose roots determine the stability region in the complex plane for $z = h\\lambda$, where $h$ is the step size. A method is considered A($\\alpha$)-stable if its stability region contains the angular sector $\\{z \\in \\mathbb{C} : |\\arg(-z)| < \\alpha\\}$.\n\nFor the k-step BDF method, the boundary of the stability region is given by the set of complex numbers $w(z) = \\sum_{j=1}^{k} \\frac{1}{j}(1-z^{-1})^j$, where $z$ lies on the unit circle. The angle $\\alpha$ is found by maximizing the ratio of the imaginary part of $w(z)$ to the negative of its real part.\n\nRecent research by Akrivis & Katsoprinakis and simplified by Gander & Wanner has led to the exact analytical expression for this angle for BDF methods. For the BDF4 method (where k=4), the square of the tangent of the stability angle $\\alpha$ has been found to be an algebraic number of degree 2, involving the square root of 2033.\n\nThe exact value for the square of the tangent of the angle $\\alpha$ for BDF4 is:\n$$ \\tan^2(\\alpha) = \\frac{1225 + 24\\sqrt{2033}}{242} $$\nTherefore, the exact value of the angle $\\alpha$ in radians is given by:\n$$ \\alpha = \\arctan\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{1225 + 24\\sqrt{2033}}{242}}\\right) $$\n\n<<<$\\arctan\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{1225 + 24\\sqrt{2033}}{242}}\\right)$>>>"
