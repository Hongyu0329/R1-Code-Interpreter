    "When a gene is duplicated in a eukaryotic genome, it creates a redundant copy. This redundancy means that one copy is often free from the selective pressure that maintained the original gene. Over evolutionary time, this duplicate gene can have several fates. Understanding these fates is key to identifying the most likely mechanism for both the retention and divergence of these genes.\n\n### Analysis of Potential Mechanisms:\n\n*   **A. Gene Conversion:** This is a process of nonreciprocal genetic exchange where one DNA sequence replaces a homologous sequence, making them identical. Rather than promoting divergence, gene conversion works to homogenize duplicated genes, counteracting the accumulation of differences. Therefore, it is not a primary mechanism for divergence.\n\n*   **B. Pseudogenization:** This is the most common fate for a duplicated gene. One copy accumulates mutations that render it non-functional, turning it into a \"pseudogene\". While this involves divergence from the functional copy, it represents the *loss* of a gene, not its *retention* as a functional part of the genome.\n\n*   **C. Neofunctionalization:** In this model, one copy of the duplicated gene retains the original ancestral function, while the other copy accumulates mutations that give it an entirely new, beneficial function. This process leads to both the retention of the duplicate (because of its new, advantageous role) and its divergence from the original gene.\n\n*   **D. Subfunctionalization:** This model, also known as the Duplication-Degeneration-Complementation (DDC) model, proposes that the ancestral gene had multiple functions or complex regulatory patterns. After duplication, each copy loses a different subset of the original functions through degenerative mutations. As a result, both genes are now required to perform the complete set of functions that the single ancestral gene once did. This \"division of labor\" ensures the retention of both copies and allows them to diverge.\n\n*   **E. Adaptive Radiation:** This is a macroevolutionary concept describing the rapid diversification of a species into multiple new forms, particularly when a change in the environment makes new resources available. It is not a molecular mechanism that acts on individual genes.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nBoth neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization are accepted models for the retention and divergence of duplicated genes. However, neofunctionalization requires the rare occurrence of a beneficial, gain-of-function mutation before the duplicate is lost to pseudogenization. In contrast, subfunctionalization can occur through more common, neutral, or nearly neutral degenerative mutations. Because this process relies on a more probable series of mutational events, many evolutionary biologists consider subfunctionalization a more likely initial mechanism for preserving duplicate genes from being lost, providing a pathway for their long-term retention and subsequent divergence.\n\n<<<D>>>"
