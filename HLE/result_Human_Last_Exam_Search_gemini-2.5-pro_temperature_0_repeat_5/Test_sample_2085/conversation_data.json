    "The French equivalent of the Gaulish name \"Odobeccus\" is not a direct translation but can be understood through the etymology of its components. The name is composed of two Gaulish elements: \"odo-\" and \"beccus\".\n\nThe element \"beccus\" translates to \"beak\" in Gaulish. This word was adopted into Latin and subsequently evolved into the modern French word \"bec,\" which also means \"beak.\" Several sources confirm that \"bec\" is one of the few hundred words in modern French that are of Gaulish origin. The term was historically used to describe a bird's beak and, by extension, a person's nose or mouth in a figurative or pejorative sense.\n\nThe prefix \"odo-\" most likely derives from the Proto-Celtic \"*ud-,\" which means \"out\" or \"away\". This prefix is found in various contexts indicating separation or movement outwards.\n\nTherefore, the name \"Odobeccus\" can be interpreted as \"one with a prominent beak\" or \"one with a beak that juts out.\" Given that \"beccus\" could refer to a person's nose or mouth, the name was likely a descriptive nickname.\n\nWhile there is no single modern French given name that is a direct equivalent of \"Odobeccus,\" the component parts have clear linguistic descendants. A literal, though not used, modern French construction would be something akin to \"Bec-en-dehors\" (beak sticking out). A historical figure named Odobeccus (also spelled Edobicus) was a general in Roman Gaul, which confirms the name's use in that period.\n\nA direct, though unverified, source suggests the French equivalent \"Sent-du-Bec,\" with the meaning \"one that has bad breath\". However, the etymological evidence for \"odo-\" meaning \"bad\" is not strongly supported by authoritative linguistic sources. The interpretation of \"outward-jutting beak/nose\" is more likely based on the established meanings of the name's components.\n\n<<<Odobeccus, meaning \"prominent beak\" or \"jutting beak,\" does not have a direct single-word equivalent in modern French, but its components survive in the French word \"bec\" (beak).>>>"
