    "\"Mercedesbenzene\" is a fictitious molecule and a chemistry joke that combines the name of the car brand Mercedes-Benz with the chemical compound benzene. The humorous depiction shows a benzene ring, which is a hexagon of six carbon atoms, with the internal bonds drawn to resemble the three-pointed star logo of Mercedes-Benz.\n\nA standard benzene molecule has the chemical formula C₆H₆, meaning it consists of six carbon atoms and six hydrogen atoms. The \"mercedes\" part of the name is a visual pun and does not represent any additional atoms. Therefore, the fictitious molecule \"mercedesbenzene\" would have the same number of carbon atoms as a regular benzene molecule.\n\n<<<6>>>"
