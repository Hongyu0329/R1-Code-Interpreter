    "To date, the human let-7 family of microRNAs consists of 10 to 13 members, depending on whether one is counting the unique mature miRNA sequences or the genomic loci that encode them.\n\nIn humans, there are 10 identified unique mature let-7 family member sequences: let-7a, let-7b, let-7c, let-7d, let-7e, let-7f, let-7g, let-7i, miR-98, and miR-202. These mature miRNAs are encoded by 12 or 13 different precursor genes located on various chromosomes. For example, the mature let-7a sequence is produced from three distinct genomic loci (let-7a-1, let-7a-2, and let-7a-3).\n\nThe let-7 family is highly conserved across many species and plays a crucial role in developmental regulation and cell differentiation. Dysregulation of the let-7 family has been linked to the development of various cancers, where it often acts as a tumor suppressor.\n\n<<<10-13>>>"
