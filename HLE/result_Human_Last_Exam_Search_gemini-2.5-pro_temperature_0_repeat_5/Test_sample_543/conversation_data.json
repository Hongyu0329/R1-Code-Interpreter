    "The reaction between 1,3-dibromo-2-iodobenzene and excess phenyl magnesium bromide involves a selective Grignard cross-coupling. The reactivity of aryl halides in such reactions is dictated by the strength of the carbon-halogen bond, with the order of reactivity being C-I > C-Br > C-Cl. The carbon-iodine bond is the weakest and therefore the most reactive site on the starting material.\n\nGiven the significant difference in reactivity, the phenyl group from the phenyl magnesium bromide will preferentially substitute the iodine atom at the 2-position. The use of \"excess\" reagent and reflux conditions in THF (tetrahydrofuran) ensures this primary reaction goes to completion. While further reaction at the less reactive C-Br positions is conceivable under harsh conditions, it is unlikely to be the major pathway without a specific catalyst, especially due to the steric hindrance from the newly introduced phenyl group. The aqueous work-up step serves to quench any unreacted Grignard reagent.\n\nThe resulting major product has a central benzene ring with two bromine atoms at positions 1 and 3, and a phenyl group at position 2.\n\nTo determine the IUPAC name, the substituents (bromo and phenyl) are listed alphabetically. The benzene ring is numbered to give the substituents the lowest possible locants, which is the 1, 2, 3 set. Therefore, the IUPAC name of the product is 1,3-dibromo-2-phenylbenzene.\n\n<<<1,3-dibromo-2-phenylbenzene>>>"
