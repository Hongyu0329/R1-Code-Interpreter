    "The cardinality of the set of continuous functions $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ that satisfy the equation $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$ is the cardinality of the continuum, denoted by $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n\nHere is a step-by-step derivation of this result.\n\n### 1. Properties of the function *f*\n\nLet the given equation be $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$.\n\n*   **Injectivity:** If $f(x_1) = f(x_2)$, then $f(f(x_1)) = f(f(x_2))$. This implies $\\exp(x_1) = \\exp(x_2)$, which means $x_1 = x_2$. Therefore, the function $f$ must be injective.\n*   **Monotonicity:** A continuous and injective function on $\\mathbb{R}$ must be strictly monotonic. Thus, $f$ is either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing.\n*   **Range:** The range of $\\exp(x)$ is $(0, \\infty)$. Since $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$, the range of the outer function $f$ is $(0, \\infty)$. This means that the values $f(x)$ are always positive.\n\n### 2. Ruling out strictly decreasing solutions\n\nLet's assume $f$ is strictly decreasing.\n1.  If $f$ is strictly decreasing, then for $x_1 < x_2$, we have $f(x_1) > f(x_2)$. Applying $f$ again, we get $f(f(x_1)) < f(f(x_2))$. This means that $f(f(x))$ is a strictly increasing function. This is consistent with $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$, which is strictly increasing.\n2.  Since $f$ is a strictly decreasing function on $\\mathbb{R}$, its range is an open interval $(L, M)$, where $L = \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} f(x)$ and $M = \\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} f(x)$.\n3.  The range of $f(f(x))$ is the image of the range of $f$ under $f$. So, $f((L, M)) = (0, \\infty)$.\n4.  Since $f$ is strictly decreasing, $f((L, M)) = (\\lim_{y \\to M^-} f(y), \\lim_{y \\to L^+} f(y))$.\n5.  This implies $\\lim_{y \\to M^-} f(y) = 0$ and $\\lim_{y \\to L^+} f(y) = \\infty$.\n6.  A continuous function $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ can only approach infinity if its argument approaches $\\pm\\infty$. From $\\lim_{y \\to L^+} f(y) = \\infty$, it must be that $L$ is not a finite number. Since $f$ is decreasing, $L < M$, so we must have $L = -\\infty$.\n7.  However, we established that the range of $f$ must be a subset of $(0, \\infty)$, which implies that $f(x) > 0$ for all $x$. This means its limit $L$ must be greater than or equal to 0.\n8.  The conclusion $L = -\\infty$ from point 6 contradicts the conclusion $L \\ge 0$ from point 7. Therefore, there are no strictly decreasing continuous solutions.\n\n### 3. Constructing strictly increasing solutions\n\nSince $f$ must be strictly increasing, we can deduce a key property:\n$f(f(f(x))) = f(\\exp(x))$.\nAlso, $f(f(f(x))) = \\exp(f(x))$.\nThus, $f$ must satisfy the commutation relation: $f(\\exp(x)) = \\exp(f(x))$.\n\nThe construction of such functions, often called \"functional square roots\" or \"half-exponentials\", relies on defining the function over a specific interval and then extending it to all of $\\mathbb{R}$ using the commutation relation.\n\nA standard way to construct these solutions is as follows:\n1.  **Choose a starting point.** Let's analyze the function's behavior based on its value at $x=0$. Let $f(0) = c$.\n2.  From the original equation, $f(f(0)) = \\exp(0) = 1$, so $f(c) = 1$.\n3.  From the commutation relation at $x=0$, $f(\\exp(0)) = \\exp(f(0))$, which means $f(1) = \\exp(c)$.\n4.  Since $f$ is strictly increasing, $0 < c < 1$. If $c \\le 0$, then $f(c) \\le f(0) = c \\le 0$, which contradicts $f(c)=1$. If $c \\ge 1$, then $f(c) \\ge f(1) = \\exp(c) > 1$, which also contradicts $f(c)=1$. So, $c$ must be in $(0, 1)$.\n5.  The construction of a solution $f$ is determined by its behavior on the interval $$. We can define $f$ on $$ by specifying its behavior on the sub-intervals $[0, c]$ and $[c, 1]$.\n    *   Choose an arbitrary continuous, strictly increasing function $g_1: [0, c] \\to [c, 1]$ such that $g_1(0) = c$ and $g_1(c) = 1$.\n    *   This choice of $g_1$ then determines the function on $[c, 1]$. For $x \\in [0, c]$, we have $f(x) = g_1(x)$. Then $f(f(x)) = f(g_1(x)) = \\exp(x)$. Let $y = g_1(x) \\in [c, 1]$. Then $x = g_1^{-1}(y)$. So, for $y \\in [c, 1]$, we must define $f(y) = \\exp(g_1^{-1}(y))$.\n6.  This defines $f$ on the interval $$. The function can then be uniquely extended to all of $\\mathbb{R}$ using the relations $f(\\exp(x)) = \\exp(f(x))$ and $f(\\ln(x)) = \\ln(f(x))$.\n\n### 4. Determining the Cardinality\n\nThe set of all such continuous functions is determined by the possible choices made during the construction.\n1.  **Choice of *c***: The parameter $c = f(0)$ can be any real number in the interval $(0, 1)$. The cardinality of this set of choices is $|\\(0, 1)| = \\mathfrak{c}$ (the cardinality of the continuum).\n2.  **Choice of the function *g‚ÇÅ***: For each fixed $c$, we can choose any continuous, strictly increasing function from $[0, c]$ to $[c, 1]$. The set of such functions is equivalent to the set of homeomorphisms of $$ onto itself, which has cardinality $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n\nSince for each of the $\\mathfrak{c}$ choices of $c$, there are $\\mathfrak{c}$ choices for the function $g_1$, the total number of distinct solutions is the product of these cardinalities. The sets of solutions for different values of $c$ are disjoint, since $f(0)=c$.\n\nTherefore, the total cardinality is $\\mathfrak{c} \\times \\mathfrak{c} = \\mathfrak{c}$.\n\nThe set of solutions is a subset of the set of all continuous functions from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$, which itself has cardinality $\\mathfrak{c}$. Our construction shows that the cardinality is at least $\\mathfrak{c}$, so it must be exactly $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n\n<<<The cardinality of the continuum, $\\mathfrak{c}$.>>>"
