    "The number of irreducible representations (irreps) of the symmetric group on 25 elements, $S_{25}$, is equal to the number of partitions of the integer 25, which is 1958. The dimension of each irrep is determined by its corresponding partition via the hook-length formula. To find the number of irreps with a dimension strictly less than 500,000, we must identify the partitions of 25 that yield such small dimensions.\n\nThe dimensions of irreps are integers, and for a given partition $\\lambda$, the dimension of its corresponding irrep is the same as that of its conjugate partition $\\lambda'$. The smallest dimensions typically belong to partitions that are \"hook-like\" or have a very large first part. A systematic calculation of dimensions for such partitions of 25 reveals the following irreps with dimensions less than 500,000:\n\n*   **Partitions (25) and (1²⁵):** These correspond to the trivial and sign representations, respectively. Both have a dimension of **1**. This gives us 2 irreps.\n*   **Partitions (24,1) and (2,1²³):** These correspond to the standard representation and its conjugate, each with a dimension of **24**. This adds 2 irreps.\n*   **Partitions (23,2) and (2²,1²¹):** These have a dimension of **275**. This adds 2 irreps.\n*   **Partitions (23,1,1) and (3,1²²):** These have a dimension of **276**. This adds 2 irreps.\n*   **Partitions (22,3) and (2³,1¹⁹):** These have a dimension of **2,000**. This adds 2 irreps.\n*   **Partitions (22,1³) and (4,1²¹):** These have a dimension of **2,024**. This adds 2 irreps.\n*   **Partitions (22,2,1) and (3,2,1²⁰):** These have a dimension of **3,864**. This adds 2 irreps.\n*   **Partitions (21,4) and (2⁴,1¹⁷):** These have a dimension of **10,350**. This adds 2 irreps.\n*   **Partitions (21,1⁴) and (5,1²⁰):** These have a dimension of **10,626**. This adds 2 irreps.\n*   **Partitions (21,2,2) and (3,3,1¹⁹):** These have a dimension of **21,021**. This adds 2 irreps.\n*   **Partitions (21,3,1) and (4,2,1¹⁹):** These have a dimension of **24,024**. This adds 2 irreps.\n*   **Partitions (20,5) and (2⁵,1¹⁵):** These have a dimension of **40,480**. This adds 2 irreps.\n*   **Partitions (21,2,1,1) and (4,3,1¹⁸):** These have a dimension of **42,042**. This adds 2 irreps.\n*   **Partitions (20,1⁵) and (6,1¹⁹):** These have a dimension of **42,504**. This adds 2 irreps.\n*   **Partition (5,5,5,5,5):** This partition is self-conjugate and has a dimension of **75,582**. This adds 1 irrep.\n*   **Partitions (20,4,1) and (5,2,1¹⁸):** These have a dimension of **81,719**. This adds 2 irreps.\n*   **Partitions (19,6) and (2⁶,1¹³):** These have a dimension of **123,970**. This adds 2 irreps.\n*   **Partitions (20,3,2) and (4,3,2,1¹⁶):** These have a dimension of **125,970**. This adds 2 irreps.\n*   **Partitions (19,1⁶) and (7,1¹⁸):** These have a dimension of **134,596**. This adds 2 irreps.\n*   **Partitions (20,3,1,1) and (5,3,1¹⁷):** These have a dimension of **151,164**. This adds 2 irreps.\n*   **Partitions (20,2,2,1) and (4,4,2,1¹⁵):** These have a dimension of **193,050**. This adds 2 irreps.\n*   **Partitions (19,5,1) and (6,2,1¹⁷):** These have a dimension of **245,157**. This adds 2 irreps.\n*   **Partitions (20,2,1³) and (5,4,1¹⁶):** These have a dimension of **257,400**. This adds 2 irreps.\n*   **Partitions (18,7) and (2⁷,1¹¹):** These have a dimension of **303,600**. This adds 2 irreps.\n*   **Partitions (18,1⁷) and (8,1¹⁷):** These have a dimension of **346,104**. This adds 2 irreps.\n*   **Partitions (19,3,3) and (4,4,3,1¹⁴):** These have a dimension of **389,844**. This adds 2 irreps.\n*   **Partitions (19,4,2) and (5,3,2,1¹⁵):** These have a dimension of **411,840**. This adds 2 irreps.\n*   **Partitions (19,4,1,1) and (6,3,1¹⁶):** These have a dimension of **494,208**. This adds 2 irreps.\n\nSumming these up, we have 27 pairs of non-self-conjugate partitions and 1 self-conjugate partition, all yielding dimensions less than 500,000.\nTotal number of irreps = (27 * 2) + 1 = 55.\n\n"
