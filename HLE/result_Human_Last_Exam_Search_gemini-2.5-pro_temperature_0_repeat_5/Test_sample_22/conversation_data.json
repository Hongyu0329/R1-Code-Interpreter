    "True.\n\nSNP heritability (h²<sub>snp</sub>) is defined as the total proportion of phenotypic variance that can be explained by the additive effects of a specific set of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). It represents the theoretical upper limit of prediction accuracy for a linear model using only those genetic variants.\n\nA polygenic score (PGS) is a tool used to predict a phenotype by summing up the effects of many SNPs, with each SNP's contribution weighted by its effect size estimated from a genome-wide association study (GWAS).\n\nThe predictive ability of a PGS is measured by the amount of variance in the phenotype it can account for (R²). In practice, this predictive power is almost always lower than the SNP heritability. This is because the effect sizes used to create the score are estimated from a finite GWAS sample and are therefore subject to estimation error. If the SNP effect sizes could be estimated without any error, the variance explained by the PGS could theoretically equal the SNP heritability. However, due to these inevitable errors in estimation, the predictive power of a PGS is substantially lower than the SNP heritability.\n\n<<<True>>>"
