    "The human GABAAρ1 homomeric receptor has one Cysteine residue located in the TM3-TM4 linker domain of each subunit.\n\nThe GABAAρ1 receptor subunit, encoded by the GABRR1 gene, has a total of three cysteine residues. Two of these are located in the extracellular N-terminal domain and form the characteristic Cys-loop (C177 and C191). The third cysteine residue (C364) is the only one located intracellularly, specifically within the large loop connecting the third and fourth transmembrane domains (TM3-TM4 linker). This intracellular loop is a site for protein interactions and post-translational modifications that can modulate the receptor's activity.\n\nSince the receptor is a homomer, meaning it is composed of five identical ρ1 subunits, the entire receptor complex contains a total of five intracellular cysteine residues, with one in each subunit's TM3-TM4 linker.\n\n<<<1>>>"
