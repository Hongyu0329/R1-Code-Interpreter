    "The product of the Favorskii rearrangement of 2-chlorocyclohexanone, when treated with a base such as sodium ethoxide in ethanol, is **ethyl cyclopentanecarboxylate**. This reaction involves a characteristic ring contraction of the six-membered cyclohexanone ring into a five-membered cyclopentane ring.\n\nThe **Böttcher Molecular Complexity (C_m)** is a quantitative index used to describe the structural complexity of a molecule. It is calculated based on principles of information theory, where the complexity is the sum of the information content of each atom's chemical microenvironment. This additive method considers several molecular features, including:\n*   Branching and connectivity\n*   The diversity of elements and isotopes\n*   Unsaturated bonds\n*   Stereochemistry\n*   Molecular symmetry\n\nCalculating the Böttcher Molecular Complexity is a complex process that requires specialized software or web-based tools, such as the Böttcher Score calculator provided by the Forli lab. These tools analyze the molecular structure to compute the score based on the defined parameters for each atom.\n\nDue to the need for specific computational tools to perform the analysis, the exact numerical Böttcher Molecular Complexity value for ethyl cyclopentanecarboxylate cannot be provided here.\n\nThe chemical structure of the product, ethyl cyclopentanecarboxylate, is:\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C₈H₁₄O₂\n*   **Structure:** A cyclopentane ring attached to a carboxylic acid ethyl ester group.\n\nWhile other complexity indices exist, such as the PubChem complexity score (which is 114 for this molecule), this value is calculated using a different methodology (Cactvs) and is not the same as the Böttcher Molecular Complexity.\n\n<<<The Böttcher Molecular Complexity of ethyl cyclopentanecarboxylate requires calculation using specialized software and is not publicly available in the searched literature.>>>"
