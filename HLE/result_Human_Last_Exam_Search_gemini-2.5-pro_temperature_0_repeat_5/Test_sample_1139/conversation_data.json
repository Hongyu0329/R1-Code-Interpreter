    "The number of non-Grassman (bosonic) variables required to parametrize the bosonic sector of the supersymmetric sigma-model for disordered systems of symmetry class D with n replicas is determined by the dimensionality of the bosonic part of the model's target space.\n\nFor symmetry class D, the target space is the supermanifold `SpO(2n, R|2n)/U(n|n)`. The non-Grassman (bosonic) sector of this space is the symmetric space given by the coset of the corresponding bosonic subgroups, which is `(Sp(2n, R) x O(2n)) / (U(n) x U(n))`. This space can be decomposed into the product of two symmetric spaces: `[Sp(2n, R) / U(n)] x [O(2n) / U(n)]`.\n\nThe number of variables is the dimension of this manifold, which is calculated as follows:\n*   The dimension of the special symplectic group `Sp(2n, R)` is `n(2n+1)`.\n*   The dimension of the orthogonal group `O(2n)` is `n(2n-1)`.\n*   The dimension of the unitary group `U(n)` is `n^2`.\n\nThe dimension of the bosonic manifold is the sum of the dimensions of its two component spaces:\n`dim = [dim(Sp(2n, R)) - dim(U(n))] + [dim(O(2n)) - dim(U(n))]`\n`dim = [n(2n+1) - n^2] + [n(2n-1) - n^2]`\n`dim = [2n^2 + n - n^2] + [2n^2 - n - n^2]`\n`dim = (n^2 + n) + (n^2 - n)`\n`dim = 2n^2`\n\nFor the specific case of two replicas, we set `n=2`:\n`dim = 2 * (2^2) = 2 * 4 = 8`\n\nTherefore, 8 non-Grassman variables are needed.\n\n<<<8>>>"
