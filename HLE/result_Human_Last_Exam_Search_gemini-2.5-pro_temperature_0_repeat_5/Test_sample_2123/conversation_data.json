    "The surname of the English poet that appears in the Russian translation of an essay describing the wide boulevards of Vienna is Pope.\n\nThe essay in question is \"The Third Tower\" (*A harmadik torony*) by the Hungarian writer Antal Szerb, who wrote about his travels in Italy and Austria in 1936. In the Russian translation of the essay, a sentence describing the clean streets of Vienna reads: \"Улицы чисты, словно их **поп**рыскали святой водой\" (\"The streets are clean, as if they had been sprinkled with holy water\").\n\nThe Russian word for \"sprinkled\" is \"попрыскали\" (popryskali), which contains the letters \"Поп\" (Pop), the Russian rendering of the surname of the 18th-century English poet Alexander Pope.\n\n<<<Pope>>>"
