    "To find the number of stable equilibrium points, we first need to find the equilibrium points of the differential equation $x'(t) = -x^{3}(t) + 2x^{2}(t) - x(t)$. The equilibrium points are the values of $x$ for which $x'(t) = 0$.\n\nLet $f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 - x$. We set $f(x) = 0$ to find the equilibrium points:\n$-x^3 + 2x^2 - x = 0$\n$-x(x^2 - 2x + 1) = 0$\n$-x(x-1)^2 = 0$\n\nThe equilibrium points are $x = 0$ and $x = 1$.\n\nNext, we need to determine the stability of these equilibrium points. The stability can be determined by analyzing the sign of the derivative of $f(x)$, denoted as $f'(x)$, at each equilibrium point. An equilibrium point $x^*$ is stable if $f'(x^*) < 0$ and unstable if $f'(x^*) > 0$.\n\nThe derivative of $f(x)$ is:\n$f'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(-x^3 + 2x^2 - x) = -3x^2 + 4x - 1$\n\nNow, we evaluate $f'(x)$ at the equilibrium points:\nFor $x = 0$:\n$f'(0) = -3(0)^2 + 4(0) - 1 = -1$\nSince $f'(0) < 0$, the equilibrium point $x = 0$ is stable.\n\nFor $x = 1$:\n$f'(1) = -3(1)^2 + 4(1) - 1 = -3 + 4 - 1 = 0$\nWhen $f'(x^*) = 0$, the stability test using the first derivative is inconclusive. We need to analyze the sign of $f(x)$ in the neighborhood of $x=1$.\nThe function is $f(x) = -x(x-1)^2$.\nFor values of $x$ slightly less than 1 (e.g., $x = 0.9$), $f(x) = -0.9(0.9-1)^2 = -0.9(-0.1)^2 = -0.009 < 0$. This means that to the left of $x=1$, the solution $x(t)$ is decreasing, moving away from $x=1$.\nFor values of $x$ slightly greater than 1 (e.g., $x = 1.1$), $f(x) = -1.1(1.1-1)^2 = -1.1(0.1)^2 = -0.011 < 0$. This means that to the right of $x=1$, the solution $x(t)$ is decreasing, moving towards $x=1$.\n\nSince solutions starting near $x=1$ on one side move away from it, the equilibrium point $x=1$ is not stable. It is classified as a semi-stable equilibrium. Therefore, the only stable equilibrium point is $x=0$.\n\nThe number of stable equilibrium points is $m=1$.\n\nThe problem asks to find the value of $m - 2^{4048}$.\nSubstituting $m=1$, we get:\n$1 - 2^{4048}$\n\n<<<1 - 2^4048>>>"
