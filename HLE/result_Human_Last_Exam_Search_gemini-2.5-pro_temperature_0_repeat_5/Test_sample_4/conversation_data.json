    "The Poincaré polynomial of a Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$ is defined as the generating function for the dimensions of its homology groups with trivial coefficients, $P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\dim \\mathfrak{g}} \\dim H_k(\\mathfrak{g}, \\mathbb{R}) x^k$.\n\nFor a nilpotent Lie algebra over a field of characteristic zero, the homology is given by the exterior algebra of its abelianization. That is, $H_k(\\mathfrak{g}, \\mathbb{R}) \\cong \\Lambda^k(\\mathfrak{g}/[\\mathfrak{g}, \\mathfrak{g}])$. This simplifies the computation of the Poincaré polynomial significantly. The dimension of the $k$-th homology group is given by the binomial coefficient $\\binom{d}{k}$, where $d$ is the dimension of the abelianization $\\mathfrak{g}_{ab} = \\mathfrak{g}/[\\mathfrak{g}, \\mathfrak{g}]$.\n\nThe Poincaré polynomial is then $P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{d} \\binom{d}{k} x^k = (1+x)^d$.\n\nWe first verify that the given Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$ is nilpotent. The lower central series is defined by $\\mathfrak{g}^1 = \\mathfrak{g}$ and $\\mathfrak{g}^{i+1} = [\\mathfrak{g}, \\mathfrak{g}^i]$.\n*   $\\mathfrak{g}^1 = \\mathfrak{g} = \\text{span}\\{e_1, \\ldots, e_6\\}$\n*   $\\mathfrak{g}^2 = [\\mathfrak{g}, \\mathfrak{g}] = \\text{span}\\{[e_1, e_2], [e_1, e_3], [e_1, e_5]\\} = \\text{span}\\{e_3, e_4, e_6\\}$\n*   $\\mathfrak{g}^3 = [\\mathfrak{g}, \\mathfrak{g}^2] = \\text{span}\\{[e_1, e_3]\\} = \\text{span}\\{e_4\\}$\n*   $\\mathfrak{g}^4 = [\\mathfrak{g}, \\mathfrak{g}^3] = [\\mathfrak{g}, \\text{span}\\{e_4\\}] = \\{0\\}$\nSince the series terminates at $\\{0\\}$, the Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$ is nilpotent.\n\nNext, we compute the dimension of the abelianization, $d = \\dim(\\mathfrak{g}_{ab})$.\nThe abelianization is the quotient of the Lie algebra by its derived algebra, $\\mathfrak{g}_{ab} = \\mathfrak{g} / [\\mathfrak{g}, \\mathfrak{g}]$.\nThe derived algebra $[\\mathfrak{g}, \\mathfrak{g}]$ is the subspace spanned by all Lie brackets of elements in $\\mathfrak{g}$. From the given commutation relations, we have:\n$[\\mathfrak{g}, \\mathfrak{g}] = \\text{span}\\{e_3, e_4, e_6\\}$.\nThe dimension of the derived algebra is $\\dim([\\mathfrak{g}, \\mathfrak{g}]) = 3$, as $e_3, e_4, e_6$ are basis vectors and thus linearly independent.\n\nThe dimension of the abelianization is:\n$d = \\dim(\\mathfrak{g}) - \\dim([\\mathfrak{g}, \\mathfrak{g}]) = 6 - 3 = 3$.\n\nTherefore, the Poincaré polynomial of $\\mathfrak{g}$ is:\n$P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = (1+x)^3$.\n\nExpanding this expression, we get:\n$P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = 1 + 3x + 3x^2 + x^3$.\n\n<<<$(1+x)^3$>>>"
