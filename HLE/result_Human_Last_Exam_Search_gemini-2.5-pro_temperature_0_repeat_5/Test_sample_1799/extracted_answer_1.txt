It is not definitively true that the second postulate is superfluous; its necessity is a subject of debate and depends on the foundational assumptions one is willing to accept. While it can be derived from the first postulate combined with Maxwell's equations or with principles of homogeneity and isotropy of space, many argue that an equivalent assumption is still required to complete the theory.
