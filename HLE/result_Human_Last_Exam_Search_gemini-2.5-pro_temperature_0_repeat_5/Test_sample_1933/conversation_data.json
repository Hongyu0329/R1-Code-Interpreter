    "The VC dimension of a class of functions (or concepts) is a measure of its complexity or expressive power. For a given logic and a signature, we can consider the set of all definable subsets of a structure's domain as a concept class. The VC dimension of the logic is the maximum VC dimension of this concept class over all possible structures.\n\nThe logic in question is $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$, where the signature $S$ contains 4 unary predicates, say $P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4$. The formulas in this logic are constructed from atomic formulas using only existential quantifiers ($\\exists$), conjunction ($\\land$), and the logical constants for true ($\\top$) and false ($\\bot$).\n\nLet's analyze the concepts definable by this logic. A concept is a subset of the domain of a structure, typically defined by a formula with one free variable, say $\\phi(y)$.\n\nA formula $\\phi(y)$ in $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$ has the general form:\n$\\exists x_1 \\dots \\exists x_m (\\psi(y, x_1, \\dots, x_m))$\nwhere $\\psi$ is a quantifier-free formula built using only $\\land$, $\\top$, and $\\bot$. Since the predicates in $S$ are all unary, the atomic formulas inside $\\psi$ can only be of the form $P_i(y)$ or $P_i(x_j)$.\n\nThe formula $\\psi$ can be separated into a part that depends on $y$ and a part that depends on the existentially quantified variables $\\bar{x}$:\n$\\psi(y, \\bar{x}) = \\psi_y(y) \\land \\psi_{\\bar{x}}(\\bar{x})$\nwhere $\\psi_y(y)$ is a conjunction of atomic formulas involving $y$, and $\\psi_{\\bar{x}}(\\bar{x})$ is a conjunction of atomic formulas involving the variables in $\\bar{x}$.\n\nThe full formula becomes:\n$\\phi(y) = \\psi_y(y) \\land \\exists \\bar{x} (\\psi_{\\bar{x}}(\\bar{x}))$\n\nFor any given structure, the sentence $\\exists \\bar{x} (\\psi_{\\bar{x}}(\\bar{x}))$ is either true or false.\n*   If it is false, the entire formula $\\phi(y)$ is equivalent to $\\bot$ (false), defining the empty set.\n*   If it is true, the formula $\\phi(y)$ is equivalent to $\\psi_y(y)$.\n\nThe formula $\\psi_y(y)$ is a conjunction of the unary predicates applied to $y$. For example, it could be $P_1(y) \\land P_3(y)$. An empty conjunction is equivalent to $\\top$ (true), defining the entire domain.\n\nTherefore, any concept definable in $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$ is equivalent to a concept defined by a formula of the form $\\bigwedge_{i \\in I} P_i(y)$ for some subset of indices $I \\subseteq \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$. This type of concept is known as a \"monotone monomial\" in learning theory.\n\nThe VC dimension of the class of all monotone monomials over $k$ variables is known to be $k$. In our case, the 4 unary predicates act as the $k=4$ variables.\n\nTo demonstrate this, we can show two things:\n1.  The VC dimension is at most 4.\n2.  The VC dimension is at least 4.\n\n**Upper Bound:** The set of definable concepts is formed by taking all possible conjunctions of the 4 base predicates. There are $2^4 = 16$ such conjunctions (including the empty conjunction which represents $\\top$). These formulas can define at most 16 distinct subsets of the domain. To shatter a set of size $d$, one needs to be able to generate all $2^d$ of its subsets. This requires at least $2^d$ distinct concepts. Therefore, $2^d \\le 16$, which implies $d \\le 4$. Thus, the VC dimension cannot be greater than 4.\n\n**Lower Bound:** To show the VC dimension is at least 4, we need to construct a set of 4 elements that can be shattered. Let the set be $Y = \\{y_1, y_2, y_3, y_4\\}$. We need to define the properties of these elements with respect to the predicates $P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4$ in a way that allows shattering. Let's define the truth value of $P_i(y_j)$ as follows:\n$P_i(y_j)$ is true if and only if $i \\neq j$.\n\nNow, for any subset $S \\subseteq Y$, we must find a concept (a conjunction of predicates) that selects exactly the elements in $S$. Let's define the concept $C_I$ by the formula $\\bigwedge_{i \\in I} P_i(y)$. To select a specific subset $S$, we choose the set of indices for our conjunction to be $I_S = \\{j \\mid y_j \\notin S\\}$.\n\nLet's verify this construction. An element $y_k$ is selected by the concept $C_{I_S}$ if and only if for all $i \\in I_S$, $P_i(y_k)$ is true.\n*   If $y_k \\in S$, then by definition of $I_S$, $k \\notin I_S$. For any $i \\in I_S$, we have $i \\neq k$. By our construction of the predicates, $P_i(y_k)$ is true for all $i \\neq k$. Thus, $y_k$ is selected.\n*   If $y_k \\notin S$, then by definition of $I_S$, $k \\in I_S$. We must check if there is an $i \\in I_S$ for which $P_i(y_k)$ is false. We can choose $i=k$. By our construction, $P_k(y_k)$ is false. Thus, $y_k$ is not selected.\n\nSince we can form a concept that corresponds to any subset of $Y$, the set $Y$ is shattered. The size of this set is 4, so the VC dimension is at least 4.\n\nCombining the upper and lower bounds, the VC dimension is exactly 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
