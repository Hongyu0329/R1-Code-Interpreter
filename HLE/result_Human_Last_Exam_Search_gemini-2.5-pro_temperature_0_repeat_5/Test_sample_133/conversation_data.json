    "Based on the analysis of the board, the optimal moves for O to win as fast as possible are c4 and f4.\n\nHere is the reasoning:\nThe current state of row 4 has two of O's pieces next to each other in columns d and e (`..OO..`).\n\n*   **Playing at c4:** Placing a piece in column c at row 4 creates a line of three (`.O O O..`). This line has open, playable spaces at both ends: b4 and f4. This creates a double threat. The opponent, X, can only block one of these spots on their next turn. If X blocks b4, O will play in f4 and win. If X blocks f4, O will play in b4 and win. This guarantees a win for O on the next turn.\n*   **Playing at f4:** Similarly, placing a piece in column f at row 4 creates a line of three (`..O O O.`). This line has open, playable spaces at both ends: c4 and g4. This also creates a double threat. If X blocks c4, O will play in g4 to win. If X blocks g4, O will play in c4 to win. This also guarantees a win for O on the next turn.\n\nBoth of these moves lead to a win in the shortest possible time. Other available moves do not create an immediate, unstoppable threat.\n\n<<<c4, f4>>>"
