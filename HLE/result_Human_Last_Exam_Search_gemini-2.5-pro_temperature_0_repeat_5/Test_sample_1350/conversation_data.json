    "I have been unable to identify a character in William Morris's *The House of the Wolfings* who visited a Roman city and described its religious practices in a way that refers to Romulus and Remus.\n\nWhile the novel depicts the conflict between the Gothic House of the Wolfings and the Roman Empire, and characters do describe Roman cities, none of the available plot summaries, character analyses, or even the full text of the novel that were consulted contain a passage where a character describes Roman religious practices with a clear allusion to the myth of Romulus and Remus.\n\nOne Wolfing warrior does offer a description of a Roman city, mentioning the \"heaped houses, dim and black as the face of hell\" and the opulent \"walls of marble\" where the Roman leaders reside, but there is no mention of their religious beliefs or founding myths in this passage. The central conflict of the book focuses on the cultural and martial clash between the two groups, with the Romans portrayed as a wealthy and powerful, yet ultimately corrupting, force.\n\nTherefore, based on the available information, it is not possible to name a character who fits the user's description. It is possible that the user is mistaken about the content of this particular book.\n\n<<<I am unable to answer this question as I cannot find any character in *The House of the Wolfings* who visited a Roman city and described their religious practices in a way that refers to Romulus and Remus.>>>"
