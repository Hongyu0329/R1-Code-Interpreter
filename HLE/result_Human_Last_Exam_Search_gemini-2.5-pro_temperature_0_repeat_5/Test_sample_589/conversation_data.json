    "There is no widely known Hollywood feature film produced by a major film studio that contains a scene where a teenager rides a pink bike and pedals directly toward an oncoming car.\n\nExtensive searches for this specific scene have not yielded a match within major Hollywood productions. While numerous films feature teenagers on bicycles, and some include scenes with pink bikes or car-related incidents, the precise combination of a teenager on a pink bike deliberately riding towards an oncoming car is not a recognized or frequently cited scene in popular cinema.\n\nIt is possible that such a scene exists in a lesser-known independent film, a foreign film, a television show, or that the details of the scene as remembered are not entirely accurate. For instance, the color of the bike or the exact nature of the confrontation with the car might differ in the actual film.\n\nSeveral coming-of-age movies and films with memorable bicycle scenes were reviewed, including classics like \"E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial,\" \"The Goonies,\" \"Now and Then,\" and \"Pee-wee's Big Adventure,\" but none contain the specific sequence described. Similarly, searches for movies involving \"playing chicken\" with cars did not reveal a scene with a teenager on a pink bicycle.\n\nTherefore, based on available information, a Hollywood feature film from a major studio with this exact scene does not appear to exist or is not prominent enough to be readily identified.\n\n<<<There is no identifiable Hollywood feature film from a major studio with this specific scene.>>>"
