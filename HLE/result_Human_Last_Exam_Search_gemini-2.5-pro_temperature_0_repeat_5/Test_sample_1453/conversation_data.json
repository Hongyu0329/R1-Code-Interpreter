    "To determine the oligomeric state of the coiled-coil sequence `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG`, we must first identify the heptad repeat pattern and then analyze the residues at the core positions based on the principles of \"knobs-into-holes\" packing.\n\n### 1. Identifying the Heptad Repeat\n\nA coiled-coil is characterized by a repeating seven-amino-acid sequence, denoted by the letters `abcdefg`. The positions 'a' and 'd' are typically occupied by hydrophobic amino acids that form the core of the structure, driving oligomerization. The given sequence is 30 amino acids long, which corresponds to approximately four heptad repeats.\n\nBy analyzing the pattern of hydrophobic residues (I, L, A, W) in the sequence, we can assign the `abcdefg` positions. The most consistent and stable arrangement is achieved when Alanine (A) is at the 'a' position and Leucine (L) is at the 'd' position.\n\nLet's align the sequence to the heptad repeat, starting the first full heptad at Alanine-4:\nSequence: `G E I **A** Q S **L** K E I **A** K S **L** K E I **A** W S **L** K E I **A** Q S **L** K G`\nRegister: `  f g **a** b c **d** e f g a b c **d** e f g a b c **d** e f g a b c **d** e f g`\n\nThis alignment reveals a consistent pattern for the four full heptad repeats:\n*   **'a' positions:** Alanine (A), Alanine (A), Alanine (A), Alanine (A)\n*   **'d' positions:** Leucine (L), Leucine (L), Leucine (L), Leucine (L)\n\nThe Tryptophan (W) at position 19 falls into a 'b' position (`a=A, b=W, c=S, d=L`), which is on the solvent-exposed face of the helix, not in the hydrophobic core.\n\n### 2. Applying Knobs-into-Holes Packing Principles\n\nThe identity of the amino acids at the 'a' and 'd' positions is the primary determinant of the oligomeric state due to packing efficiency in the hydrophobic core.\n\n*   **Dimer vs. Tetramer:** Studies have shown that the size of the amino acid side chains at the core positions is critical. A well-established rule relates to the presence of the small amino acid Alanine. When multiple Alanine residues align in the same layer of the hydrophobic core in a potential higher-order oligomer (like a tetramer), they create a large, energetically unfavorable cavity.\n*   In the given sequence, the 'a' position is consistently Alanine. If this peptide were to form a tetramer, each layer of the core would have four Alanine residues at the 'a' positions. This would create a significant void, destabilizing the tetrameric structure.\n*   A dimeric (two-stranded) structure is therefore favored. In a dimer, the packing arrangement can more easily accommodate the small Alanine side chains without creating a large central cavity, leading to a more stable conformation.\n*   **Trimer:** Trimeric coiled-coils typically have a different pattern of hydrophobic residues, often Isoleucine at both the 'a' and 'd' positions (`a=I, d=I`) or contain polar residues like Asparagine in the core to specify the trimeric state. The `a=A, d=L` pattern is not characteristic of a trimer.\n\nBased on the consistent `a=A, d=L` pattern and the principle that a layer of small Alanine residues in the core destabilizes a tetramer in favor of a dimer, the most likely oligomeric state for this sequence is 2.\n\n<<<A>>>"
