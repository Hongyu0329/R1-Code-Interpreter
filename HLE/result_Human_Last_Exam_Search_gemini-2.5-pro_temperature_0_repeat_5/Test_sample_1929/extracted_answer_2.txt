The reaction between butadiene and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene results in a mixture of two primary products: **4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohexene** from a [4+2] cycloaddition (Diels-Alder reaction) and **1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoro-3-vinylcyclobutane** from a [2+2] cycloaddition. The [2+2] adduct is generally the major product under kinetic control (lower temperatures), while the [4+2] adduct is favored under thermodynamic control (higher temperatures).
