    "In a 6-31G basis set calculation of toluene (C7H8), a total of 79 contracted Gaussian functions are used. This is determined by summing the number of functions for each atom in the molecule.\n\nHere is the breakdown of the calculation:\n\n*   **For each Carbon (C) atom:** The 6-31G basis set is a split-valence basis set. For second-row atoms like carbon, it uses:\n    *   One contracted function for the core (1s) orbital.\n    *   Two contracted functions for the valence 2s orbital.\n    *   Two sets of three contracted functions for the valence 2p orbitals (2px, 2py, 2pz).\n    *   This results in a total of 1 + 2 + (2 * 3) = 9 contracted basis functions per carbon atom.\n\n*   **For each Hydrogen (H) atom:** As hydrogen has no core electrons, the 6-31G basis set uses two contracted functions to describe its 1s valence orbital.\n\nThe toluene molecule consists of 7 carbon atoms and 8 hydrogen atoms.\n\nTherefore, the total number of contracted Gaussian functions is calculated as follows:\n\n(7 Carbon atoms × 9 functions/atom) + (8 Hydrogen atoms × 2 functions/atom) = 63 + 16 = 79 functions.\n\n<<<79>>>"
