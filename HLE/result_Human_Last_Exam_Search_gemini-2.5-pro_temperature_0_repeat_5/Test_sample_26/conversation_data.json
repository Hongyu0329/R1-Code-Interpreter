    "Let $X$ be a smooth quintic hypersurface in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$. We want to determine the rank of its third homotopy group, $\\pi_3(X)$.\n\n1.  **Topological Nature of X**: A hypersurface in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$ is a complex surface, which corresponds to a real, closed, oriented 4-manifold.\n\n2.  **Connectivity**: By the Lefschetz Hyperplane Theorem, the inclusion map $i: X \\hookrightarrow \\mathbb{CP}^3$ induces isomorphisms on homotopy groups $\\pi_k$ for $k < n-1$, where $n=3$ is the complex dimension of the ambient space. Thus, $\\pi_1(X) \\cong \\pi_1(\\mathbb{CP}^3)$. Since $\\mathbb{CP}^3$ is simply connected, its fundamental group $\\pi_1(\\mathbb{CP}^3)$ is trivial. Therefore, $\\pi_1(X) = 0$, meaning $X$ is a simply connected space.\n\n3.  **Betti Numbers**: To understand the topology of this 4-manifold, we compute its Betti numbers ($b_k = \\text{rank}(H_k(X))$).\n    *   Since $X$ is connected, $b_0 = 1$.\n    *   By Poincaré duality for a 4-manifold, $b_4 = b_0 = 1$.\n    *   Since $\\pi_1(X)=0$, the first homology group $H_1(X)$ is also trivial, so $b_1 = 0$.\n    *   For a compact Kähler manifold, the Betti numbers are related to the Hodge numbers $h^{p,q}$. Specifically, $b_1 = h^{1,0} + h^{0,1}$. As $b_1=0$, we have $h^{1,0}=h^{0,1}=0$.\n    *   By Serre duality for a complex surface, $h^{p,q} = h^{2-p, 2-q}$. This implies $h^{2,1} = h^{0,1} = 0$ and $h^{1,2} = h^{1,0} = 0$.\n    *   The third Betti number is given by $b_3 = h^{2,1} + h^{1,2} = 0 + 0 = 0$.\n    *   The Euler characteristic $\\chi(X)$ is given by the sum $\\sum_{k=0}^4 (-1)^k b_k = b_0 - b_1 + b_2 - b_3 + b_4 = 1 - 0 + b_2 - 0 + 1 = 2 + b_2$.\n    *   The Euler characteristic can also be computed using Chern classes. For a degree $d=5$ hypersurface in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$, the Euler characteristic is $\\chi(X) = 55$.\n    *   Equating the two expressions for $\\chi(X)$, we get $55 = 2 + b_2$, which implies $b_2 = 53$.\n\n4.  **Homotopy Groups of 4-Manifolds**: For a simply connected, closed 4-manifold $M$, its homotopy type is closely related to its second Betti number, $k=b_2$. A theorem by Basu and Basu states that for $j \\ge 3$, the $j$-th homotopy group of such a manifold is given by $\\pi_j(M) \\cong \\pi_j(\\#_{k-1}(S^2 \\times S^3))$, where $\\#$ denotes the connected sum.\n    *   In our case, $k = b_2 = 53$.\n    *   Therefore, $\\pi_3(X) \\cong \\pi_3(\\#_{52}(S^2 \\times S^3))$.\n\n5.  **Rank Calculation**: The rank of a homotopy group of a connected sum is the sum of the ranks of the individual homotopy groups.\n    *   $\\text{rank}(\\pi_3(X)) = 52 \\times \\text{rank}(\\pi_3(S^2 \\times S^3))$.\n    *   Using the Künneth formula for homotopy groups, $\\pi_3(S^2 \\times S^3) \\cong \\pi_3(S^2) \\oplus \\pi_3(S^3)$.\n    *   It is a standard result that $\\pi_3(S^2) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$ (generated by the Hopf fibration) and $\\pi_3(S^3) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n    *   Thus, $\\pi_3(S^2 \\times S^3) \\cong \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}$, which has a rank of 2.\n    *   Finally, the rank of $\\pi_3(X)$ is $52 \\times 2 = 104$.\n\n<<<104>>>"
