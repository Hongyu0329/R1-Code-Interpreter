    "Without the influence of Norse invaders, the Modern English word for \"sister\" would likely be **\"suster\"** or perhaps **\"swester.\"**\n\nHere's a breakdown of why:\n\n*   **The Original Anglo-Saxon Word:** The native Old English word for a female sibling was *sweoster* (with variations like *swustor* and *soester*). This word comes from the Proto-Germanic **swestÄ“r*, which is also the ancestor of the German word *Schwester* and the Dutch *zuster*.\n\n*   **The Norse Influence:** Between the 9th and 11th centuries, extensive contact and settlement by Norse speakers introduced their word, *systir*, into the English language. Over time, the pronunciation and spelling of the Old English *sweoster* were heavily influenced by the similar-sounding Old Norse *systir*, eventually giving us the modern word \"sister\". This was part of a broader linguistic impact where thousands of Norse words entered the English vocabulary, including core words like *egg*, *leg*, *sky*, and *take*.\n\n*   **A Different Evolutionary Path:** Had the Norse never arrived, *sweoster* would have followed a natural evolutionary path into Middle and then Modern English. In many dialects, the Old English *sweoster* became *suster*. This form would likely have continued. Looking at the evolution of similar words and the development in related languages not as heavily impacted by Norse, \"suster\" is the most probable modern form. This is supported by the Dutch cognate *zuster*. Another possibility is that it could have become \"swester,\" similar to the German *Schwester*."
