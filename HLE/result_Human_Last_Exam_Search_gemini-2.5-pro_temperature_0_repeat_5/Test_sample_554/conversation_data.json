    "Hypothetically, a perfluoronanocar would contain 274 fluorine atoms.\n\nThis calculation is based on the chemical formula of a well-documented nanocar developed at Rice University, which is C430H274O12. The term \"perfluorinated\" signifies that all hydrogen (H) atoms in a hydrocarbon have been replaced with fluorine (F) atoms. Therefore, by replacing the 274 hydrogen atoms in this specific nanocar structure with fluorine atoms, one arrives at the number 274.\n\nIt is worth noting that the term \"nanocar\" can refer to various molecular structures. These single-molecule machines are composed of a chassis and wheels, often made of fullerene, and are designed to roll across surfaces. Different designs possess different chemical formulas, which would result in a different number of fluorine atoms in their perfluorinated state. However, the C430H274O12 structure is a frequently cited example.\n\n<<<274>>>"
