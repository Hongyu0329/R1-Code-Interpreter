In the context of Interval Type-3 Membership Functions (IT3 MFs) using a Gaussian-based paradigm, the mathematical formulation for the vertical cross-section at a fixed primary input `x'` is an Interval Type-2 Membership Function (IT2 MF) defined for a secondary input `u`. This IT2 MF is characterized by its upper and lower membership functions, `μ̄_Ã(x', u)` and `μ̲_Ã(x', u)`, respectively.

The formulation is as follows:

The vertical cross-section `μ̃_Ã(x', u)` is given by the interval:
`μ̃_Ã(x', u) = [μ̲_Ã(x', u), μ̄_Ã(x', u)]`

where the upper and lower bounds are defined by Gaussian functions whose parameters can depend on the primary input `x'`:

**Upper Membership Function (UMF) of the vertical cross-section:**
`μ̄_Ã(x', u) = exp(-1/2 * ((u - c_u(x')) / σ_u(x'))²) `

**Lower Membership Function (LMF) of the vertical cross-section:**
`μ̲_Ã(x', u) = s_u(x') * exp(-1/2 * ((u - c_l(x')) / σ_l(x'))²) `

Here:
*   `u` is the secondary input variable, with its domain defined by the footprint of uncertainty of the primary membership function at `x'`.
*   `c_u(x')` and `c_l(x')` are the centers (means) of the Gaussian functions for the upper and lower bounds of the vertical slice, expressed as functions of `x'`.
*   `σ_u(x')` and `σ_l(x')` are the standard deviations (widths) of these Gaussian functions, also dependent on `x'`.
*   `s_u(x')` is a scaling factor for the lower membership function of the vertical slice, where `0 ≤ s_u(x') ≤ 1`, and can also be a function of `x'`.
