    "### The Role of Large Deviation Theory\n\nThe equilibrium state of a physical system, such as a gas of light quanta (photons), is the macroscopic state that is overwhelmingly the most probable. Large deviation theorems provide the formal mathematical framework to understand this principle.\n\n*   **Boltzmann-Sanov Theorem**: This theorem deals with the probability that the empirical distribution of a large number of particles deviates from the true, underlying probability distribution. It states that this probability decreases exponentially, with a rate determined by the relative entropy (or Kullback-Leibler divergence). In statistical mechanics, this implies that the system will almost certainly be found in the macroscopic configuration that maximizes the entropy, as all other configurations are exponentially less likely. This provides a rigorous foundation for Boltzmann's principle, `S = k log W`, and the principle of maximum entropy.\n\n*   **Cramér-Chernoff Theorem**: This theorem is a specific case of the large deviation principle, focusing on the probability that the average of a set of random variables (like the energy per particle) deviates from its expected value. For a physical system, it quantifies the probability of observing a mean energy that is different from the equilibrium mean energy, showing this probability to be exponentially small.\n\nIn essence, these theorems justify the core method of equilibrium statistical mechanics: to find the equilibrium properties of a system, one must find the macroscopic state that maximizes the entropy subject to the system's physical constraints. For the Bose case of light quanta, this means we must find the state of maximum entropy for a gas of bosons where the particle number is not conserved.\n\n### The Photon Gas in Equilibrium\n\nA gas of light quanta (a photon gas) is a collection of bosons. A key characteristic, particularly in the context of black-body radiation, is that photons are continuously emitted and absorbed by the walls of their container. This means the total number of photons is not a conserved quantity. A direct consequence of the non-conserved particle number is that the chemical potential (μ) of a photon gas in thermodynamic equilibrium is zero.\n\nApplying the principle of maximum entropy, as justified by large deviation theory, the equilibrium distribution for the average number of photons `<n(ν)>` in a mode with frequency ν is the Bose-Einstein distribution with μ=0:\n\n<center>\n&lt;n(ν)&gt; = 1 / (e<sup>hν/k<sub>B</sub>T</sup> - 1)\n</center>\n\nwhere:\n*   `h` is Planck's constant\n*   `k_B` is the Boltzmann constant\n*   `T` is the absolute temperature\n\n### Equilibrium Mean Energy\n\nThe equilibrium mean energy (`U`) of the photon gas is found by integrating the energy of each mode (`hν`) multiplied by the average number of photons in that mode and the density of states over all frequencies. The density of electromagnetic modes in a volume `V` is given by `g(ν)dν = (8πV/c³)ν²dν`.\n\nThe total mean energy is therefore:\n`U = ∫₀^∞ hν <n(ν)> g(ν) dν = ∫₀^∞ hν * (1 / (e^(hν/k_B T) - 1)) * (8πV/c³)ν² dν`\n\nEvaluating this integral yields the Stefan-Boltzmann law for the total energy of black-body radiation.\n\n<<<The equilibrium mean energy is given by:\n**U(V, T) = (8π⁵k<sub>B</sub>⁴ / 15h³c³) * V * T⁴**\n\nThis shows that the mean energy is proportional to the volume `V` and the fourth power of the temperature `T`.\n\n### Equilibrium Entropy\n\nThe entropy (`S`) can be determined from the fundamental thermodynamic relation `dU = TdS - PdV`, where the pressure `P` of a photon gas is related to its energy density by `P = U / 3V`. Rearranging for `dS` gives:\n\n`dS = (1/T)dU + (P/T)dV = (1/T)dU + (U/3VT)dV`\n\nSubstituting the expression for `U` and integrating yields the equilibrium entropy.\n\n<<<The equilibrium entropy is given by:\n**S(V, T) = (32π⁵k<sub>B</sub>⁴ / 45h³c³) * V * T³**\n\nThe entropy of the photon gas at equilibrium is proportional to the volume `V` and the third power of the temperature `T`."
