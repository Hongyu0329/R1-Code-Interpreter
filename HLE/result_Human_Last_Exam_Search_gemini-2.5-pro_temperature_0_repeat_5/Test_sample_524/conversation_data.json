    "There are four homeomorphism classes of homogeneous planar continua.\n\nA complete classification of these mathematical objects shows that any such continuum is homeomorphic to one of the following four spaces:\n\n*   **The point:** This is the simplest, degenerate case of a continuum.\n*   **The simple closed curve (or circle):** This was for a time thought to be the only non-degenerate example.\n*   **The pseudo-arc:** Discovered by R. H. Bing in 1948, this was the second known example of a non-degenerate homogeneous planar continuum. It is a one-dimensional, hereditarily indecomposable continuum.\n*   **The circle of pseudo-arcs:** Introduced by Bing and F. B. Jones in 1959, this is the third and final non-degenerate example. It can be thought of as a continuous collection of pseudo-arcs arranged in a circle.\n\nThe question of whether other such continua existed was a long-standing problem in topology, first posed by Knaster and Kuratowski in 1920. The classification was finally completed in 2014 by L. Hoehn and L. G. Oversteegen, who proved that the three non-degenerate examples—the circle, the pseudo-arc, and the circle of pseudo-arcs—are the only ones.\n\n<<<4>>>"
