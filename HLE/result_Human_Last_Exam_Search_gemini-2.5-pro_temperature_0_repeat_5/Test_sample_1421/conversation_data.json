    "The formula for the fermionic partition function Z in the imaginary time representation using Feynman's path integral formalism is given by a functional integral over anti-commuting Grassmann fields. This formulation is a cornerstone of quantum statistical mechanics and many-body theory.\n\nThe partition function in quantum statistical mechanics is defined as the trace of the thermal density matrix:\n\n**Z = Tr(e⁻βᴴ)**\n\nwhere:\n*   **Z** is the partition function.\n*   **Tr** denotes the trace over the system's Hilbert space.\n*   **β = 1/(kᵦT)** is the inverse temperature, with kᵦ being the Boltzmann constant and T the temperature.\n*   **Ĥ** is the Hamiltonian operator of the system.\n\nTo express this in the path integral formalism, the following steps are taken:\n\n1.  **Imaginary Time:** The time variable *t* is analytically continued to imaginary time τ via a Wick rotation, *t* → -iτ. This transforms the quantum mechanical time evolution operator, e⁻ⁱᴴᵗ, into the statistical mechanical Boltzmann factor, e⁻βᴴ. The integration over imaginary time τ runs from 0 to β.\n\n2.  **Fermionic Fields and Grassmann Numbers:** Due to the Pauli exclusion principle, fermionic fields are described by anti-commuting numbers, known as Grassmann numbers, rather than ordinary complex numbers. Any two Grassmann variables, ηᵢ and ηⱼ, satisfy the anti-commutation relation: {ηᵢ, ηⱼ} = ηᵢηⱼ + ηⱼηᵢ = 0.\n\n3.  **Path Integral over Grassmann Fields:** The trace operation is expressed as an integral over all possible configurations of the fermionic fields, which are represented by Grassmann-valued functions ψ(x, τ) and their conjugates ψ*(x, τ).\n\n4.  **Anti-periodic Boundary Conditions:** A crucial feature for fermions is that the fields must satisfy anti-periodic boundary conditions in the imaginary time direction. This means that a field configuration at imaginary time τ=0 is related to the configuration at τ=β by a minus sign:\n\n    **ψ(x, τ=0) = -ψ(x, τ=β)**\n    **ψ*(x, τ=0) = -ψ*(x, τ=β)**\n\nCombining these elements, the fermionic partition function Z is expressed as a functional integral:\n\n<<<Z = ∫ D[ψ*]D[ψ] exp(-Sₑ[ψ*, ψ])>>>\n\nwhere:\n*   **∫ D[ψ*]D[ψ]** represents the functional integral over all possible configurations of the Grassmann fields ψ* and ψ, subject to the anti-periodic boundary conditions in imaginary time.\n*   **Sₑ[ψ*, ψ]** is the Euclidean action of the system, obtained by integrating the Euclidean Lagrangian density Lₑ over imaginary time and space:\n\n    **Sₑ = ∫₀ᵝ dτ ∫ dᵈx Lₑ(ψ*, ψ, ∂τψ, ∇ψ)**\n\nThe Euclidean Lagrangian, Lₑ, is derived from the standard Lagrangian by the Wick rotation. For a typical non-relativistic fermion system, the Euclidean action takes the form:\n\n**Sₑ = ∫₀ᵝ dτ ∫ dᵈx ψ*(x, τ) (∂τ - (∇²/2m) - μ) ψ(x, τ) + V[ψ*, ψ]**\n\nHere, ∂τ is the partial derivative with respect to imaginary time, ∇² is the Laplacian operator, *m* is the fermion mass, *μ* is the chemical potential, and *V[ψ*, ψ]* represents the interaction terms. The integral over the Grassmann fields evaluates to the determinant of the operator in the action for non-interacting systems."
