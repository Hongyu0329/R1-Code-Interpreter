Yes, changing the amide group to a PEG group is a very likely solution to the observed precipitation problem. By replacing the amide linkage and extending the existing short PEG-like motif with a longer PEG chain, the probe's overall hydrophilicity would be significantly increased, and the tendency for intermolecular aggregation would be reduced. This should allow the probe to remain soluble in the cell culture medium at the desired concentration. However, the student should be aware that this structural modification could also impact the probe's biological activity and cell permeability, which would need to be experimentally re-evaluated.
