To apply the Banach fixed-point theorem, you should define the set **M** as a closed ball of radius R within the space of continuous functions on that satisfy the boundary conditions. Specifically:

**M = {u ∈ C() | u(0) = u(1) = 0 and ||u||_∞ ≤ R}**

where the radius R is a positive constant chosen to ensure the operator T is a contraction mapping from M to M. This requires R to satisfy the condition:

**R < ln(8)**

**Derivation of the condition on R:**

To be a contraction, the operator T must satisfy ||Tu - Tv||_∞ ≤ k ||u - v||_∞ for some constant k < 1. For u, v ∈ M:

|(Tu)(x) - (Tv)(x)| ≤ ∫₀¹ |G(x, s)| |exp(u(s)) - exp(v(s))| ds

By the Mean Value Theorem, |exp(u(s)) - exp(v(s))| ≤ exp(c) |u(s) - v(s)| for some c between u(s) and v(s). Since u, v ∈ M, ||u||_∞ ≤ R and ||v||_∞ ≤ R, which implies |c| ≤ R. Thus, exp(c) ≤ exp(R).

This leads to:
||Tu - Tv||_∞ ≤ exp(R) ||u - v||_∞ * max_x ∫₀¹ |G(x, s)| ds

The integral term max_x ∫₀¹ |G(x, s)| ds can be calculated to be 1/8. Therefore, the inequality becomes:
||Tu - Tv||_∞ ≤ (exp(R)/8) ||u - v||_∞

For T to be a contraction, the Lipschitz constant k = exp(R)/8 must be less than 1.
exp(R)/8 < 1  =>  exp(R) < 8  =>  **R < ln(8)**

Additionally, we must ensure that T maps M into itself (i.e., if u ∈ M, then Tu ∈ M). This requires ||Tu||_∞ ≤ R, which leads to the condition exp(R)/8 ≤ R. Any R satisfying 0 < R < ln(8) also satisfies this second, less strict, condition. Therefore, the defining constraint for the set M is R < ln(8).
