    "The reaction described is a classic example of a directed ortho-metalation (DoM) followed by an electrophilic quench.\n\n**Step 1: Directed ortho-Metalation**\n\nThe first step involves the reaction of N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide with sec-butyllithium (sec-BuLi) and tetramethylethylenediamine (TMEDA) in tetrahydrofuran (THF).\n\n*   **N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide** is the aromatic substrate. It has two directing metalation groups (DMGs) on the benzene ring: the N,N-diethylcarboxamide group (-CONEt₂) and the dimethylamino group (-NMe₂).\n*   **sec-BuLi** is a strong organolithium base used to deprotonate an acidic proton on the aromatic ring. It is more basic and sterically hindered than n-butyllithium.\n*   **TMEDA** is a chelating agent that complexes with the lithium ion, increasing the basicity and reactivity of the organolithium reagent.\n*   **THF** is the solvent for the reaction.\n\nThe reaction is a directed ortho-metalation, where the deprotonation (lithiation) occurs at a position ortho (adjacent) to a directing group. In this molecule, there are two directing groups. The N,N-diethylcarboxamide group is at position 1, and the dimethylamino group is at position 3. To determine the site of lithiation, we must consider the relative directing strength of these two groups.\n\nThe generally accepted order of directing ability for common groups is: -CONR₂ > -OMe > -NR₂. The amide group is a significantly stronger directing group than the amino group. Therefore, the lithiation will occur at one of the positions ortho to the stronger N,N-diethylcarboxamide group, which are the C2 and C6 positions.\n\nBetween C2 and C6, the C2 position is also ortho to the weaker dimethylamino directing group at C3. When two directing groups are in a meta-relationship (1,3-), they often work cooperatively to direct metalation to the position between them (C2). This cooperative effect, combined with the strong directing nature of the amide, makes the proton at the C2 position the most acidic and the most likely to be removed.\n\nThe intermediate formed is 2-lithio-N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide.\n\n**Step 2: Electrophilic Quench**\n\nThe second step is the reaction of the lithiated intermediate with methyl iodide (CH₃I).\n\n*   The aryllithium compound is a potent nucleophile.\n*   Methyl iodide is an electrophile.\n\nThe nucleophilic carbanion at the C2 position of the benzene ring attacks the electrophilic methyl group of methyl iodide, displacing the iodide ion in a nucleophilic substitution reaction. This results in the formation of a new carbon-carbon bond.\n\n**Final Product**\n\nThe final compound obtained is **N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide**.\n\nThe overall transformation is the regioselective methylation of the aromatic ring at the position ortho to the amide group and ortho to the dimethylamino group.\n\n<<<N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide>>>"
