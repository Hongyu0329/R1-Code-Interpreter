    "There are exactly **36** finite groups that contain maximal by inclusion product-free sets of size 3.\n\nA subset *S* of a group *G* is called \"product-free\" if for any two elements *a* and *b* in *S* (including the case where *a* = *b*), their product *ab* is not in *S*. A product-free set is \"maximal by inclusion\" (also known as \"locally maximal\") if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set within the same group.\n\nThe classification of finite groups containing such sets of size 3 was completed by Chimere Anabanti and Sarah Hart. In their 2015 paper, \"Locally Maximal Product-free Sets of Size 3,\" they proved a conjecture by Michael Giudici and Hart that the order of any such group is at most 24. This confirmed that the list of such groups is finite.\n\nThe complete list of these groups, compiled from the tables in the aforementioned research papers, is as follows:\n\n**Cyclic Groups (14 groups):**\n*   C₆, C₇, C₈, C₉, C₁₀, C₁₁, C₁₂, C₁₃, C₁₄, C₁₅, C₁₆, C₁₈, C₂₀, C₂₄\n\n**Dihedral Groups (7 groups):**\n*   D₆ (isomorphic to S₃), D₈, D₁₀, D₁₂, D₁₄, D₁₈, D₂₀\n\n**Dicyclic and Quaternion Groups (5 groups):**\n*   Q₈ (the quaternion group), Q₁₂ (dicyclic group of order 12), Q₁₆, Q₂₀, Q₂₄\n\n**Other Abelian Groups (4 groups):**\n*   C₂ × C₄, C₂ × C₆, C₂ × C₈, C₃ × C₃\n\n**Other Non-Abelian Groups (6 groups):**\n*   A₄ (the alternating group on 4 elements)\n*   C₂ × C₁₂\n*   C₃ × S₃\n*   C₅ × S₃\n*   SL(2,3) (the special linear group of 2x2 matrices over the field with 3 elements)\n*   C₂ × C₂ × C₂ (the elementary abelian group of order 8)\n\nCounting these distinct groups gives a total of 36.\n\n<<<36>>>"
