**Function f:**
The function $f$ maps a natural number $w$ to a linear logic formula.
$$
f(w) = \bigotimes_{i=1}^{w} \bot = \bot^w
$$
where $\bot^0 = 1$. This formula represents a resource of size $w$.

**Formula C:**
The formula $C$, which depends on $m$ and $b$, is:
$$
C(W, m, b) = \left( \left( \bigotimes_{i=1}^{b} \bot \right) \multimap 1 \right)^m \multimap 1
$$
This can be written more compactly as:
$$
C(W, m, b) = (\bot^b \multimap 1)^m \multimap 1
$$
This formula represents the assertion that if one is provided with $m$ "bins" (each requiring resources of size $b$ to produce a success token $1$), one can successfully fill all of them, resulting in a final success state $1$.
