    "In the world of ballroom dancing, precise technique is paramount. For the reverse turn, a fundamental figure in many dances, the amount of rotation is strictly defined. While some dances allow for variations in turn, in one particular dance, overturning a reverse turn is considered a technical impossibility that would disrupt the fundamental mechanics of the figure.\n\nThe dance in which it is impossible to overturn a reverse turn without disregarding the technique is the **Slow Foxtrot**.\n\nThe technical reason for this lies in the lady's heel turn, which is an integral part of the reverse turn in Slow Foxtrot. For the figure to be executed correctly, the lady must complete her turn on the heel to a specific alignment, but not overturn it. One of the key technical descriptions states that the lady's step following the heel turn should be straight forward between the man's legs. This is only possible if she has completed the turn precisely and has not overturned. Overturning the heel turn would misalign the lady, making it impossible for her and her partner to proceed with the correct footwork and body positioning for the remainder of the figure, thus fundamentally breaking the technique.\n\nIn contrast, other dances listed have technical provisions for overturning turns:\n*   **Viennese Waltz:** While it is exceptionally difficult and generally avoided, with dancers preferring to under-turn a natural turn to navigate corners, some sources suggest that a slight overturning of the reverse turn is necessary at corners. The difficulty makes it impractical, but not strictly impossible by definition within all technical interpretations.\n*   **English Waltz:** This dance includes figures such as the \"overturned running spin turn,\" indicating that overturning is a recognized part of its advanced technique.\n*   **European Tango:** The technique includes variations like the \"overturned Progressive Side Step,\" which is part of a specific reverse turn figure.\n*   **Quickstep:** Figures like the \"overturned Progressive Chass√©\" are used in amalgamations, demonstrating that overturning is a technical option.\n\nTherefore, the Slow Foxtrot stands out as the dance where the established technique of the reverse turn, specifically the lady's heel turn, cannot be overturned without fundamentally violating the mechanics of the dance.\n\n<<<D>>>"
