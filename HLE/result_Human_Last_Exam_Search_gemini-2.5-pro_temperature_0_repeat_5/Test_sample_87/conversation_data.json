    "To find the largest possible value of $I(X;Y|W)$, we will use the fundamental identities of information theory.\n\nFirst, let's establish the relationship between the quantities we want to find and the given information. The chain rule for mutual information can be expressed in two ways:\n$I(A; B, C) = I(A; B) + I(A; C | B)$\n$I(A; B, C) = I(A; C) + I(A; B | C)$\n\nEquating these gives the identity:\n$I(A; B) + I(A; C | B) = I(A; C) + I(A; B | C)$\n\nLet's apply this identity to the variables $X, Y, W$:\n$I(X; Y) + I(X; W | Y) = I(X; W) + I(X; Y | W)$\n\nWe want to find the value of $I(X;Y|W)$. Let's rearrange the equation to solve for it:\n$I(X; Y | W) = I(X; Y) + I(X; W | Y) - I(X; W)$\n\nWe are given that $I(X;Y) = 3$. Substituting this value, we get:\n$I(X; Y | W) = 3 + I(X; W | Y) - I(X; W)$\n\nTo maximize $I(X;Y|W)$, we need to maximize the difference $I(X; W | Y) - I(X; W)$. Let's analyze this difference term. Using another standard identity, we can express this difference in another form:\n$I(X; W | Y) - I(X; W) = I(Y; W | X) - I(Y; W)$\n\nSo, our expression for $I(X;Y|W)$ becomes:\n$I(X; Y | W) = 3 + I(Y; W | X) - I(Y; W)$\n\nTo find the maximum possible value of $I(X;Y|W)$, we need to maximize $I(Y; W | X)$ and minimize $I(Y; W)$.\n\n1.  **Bounding $I(Y; W | X)$**: The random variable $W$ is a deterministic function of $Z$. This means that any information carried by $W$ is also present in $Z$. The Data Processing Inequality states that for any function $f$, $I(A; f(B) | C) \\le I(A; B | C)$. Applying this here with $A=Y$, $B=Z$, $C=X$, and $W=f(Z)$, we get:\n    $I(Y; W | X) \\le I(Y; Z | X)$\n\n2.  **Bounding $I(Y; W)$**: The mutual information $I(Y;W)$ is always non-negative, so its minimum possible value is 0. This occurs if $W$ and $Y$ are independent.\n\nCombining these, the maximum value of the difference term is bounded by:\n$I(Y; W | X) - I(Y; W) \\le I(Y; Z | X) - 0 = I(Y; Z | X)$\n\nTherefore, the largest possible value of $I(X;Y|W)$ is:\n$I(X; Y | W)_{max} = 3 + I(Y; Z | X)$\n\nNow, we need to calculate $I(Y;Z|X)$ from the given values. We can use the interaction information $I(X;Y;Z)$ as an intermediate step.\n$I(X;Y;Z) = I(X;Y) - I(X;Y|Z)$\n$I(X;Y;Z) = 3 - 2 = 1$\n\nThe interaction information can also be expressed as:\n$I(X;Y;Z) = I(Y;Z) - I(Y;Z|X)$\nThis gives us:\n$I(Y;Z|X) = I(Y;Z) - I(X;Y;Z) = I(Y;Z) - 1$\n\nTo find $I(Y;Z)$, we use the chain rule on the total information $X$ has about the pair $(Y,Z)$:\n$I(X; Y, Z) = I(X; Y) + I(X; Z | Y) = 3 + 5 = 8$\n\nWe can also express this as:\n$I(X; Y, Z) = I(X; Z) + I(X; Y | Z) = I(X;Z) + 2$\nFrom this, we find $I(X;Z) = 8 - 2 = 6$.\n\nNow, consider the information that $Z$ has about the pair $(X,Y)$:\n$I(Z; X, Y) = I(Z; Y) + I(Z; X | Y)$\nSince $I(A;B)=I(B;A)$, we have $I(Z;X,Y) = I(X,Y;Z)$. And from our earlier calculation, $I(X;Y,Z) = 8$.\nSo, $8 = I(Y;Z) + I(X;Z|Y)$.\n$8 = I(Y;Z) + 5$\n$I(Y;Z) = 3$\n\nNow we can calculate $I(Y;Z|X)$:\n$I(Y;Z|X) = I(Y;Z) - I(X;Y;Z) = 3 - 1 = 2$\n\nFinally, we can find the largest possible value of $I(X;Y|W)$:\n$I(X; Y | W)_{max} = 3 + I(Y; Z | X) = 3 + 2 = 5$\n\nThis maximum value is achievable if a function $W=f(Z)$ can be chosen such that $I(Y;W)=0$ (W is independent of Y) and $I(Y;W|X) = I(Y;Z|X) = 2$. Such a construction is possible in principle.\n\nThe largest possible value of $I(X;Y|W)$ is 5.\n\n<<<5>>>"
