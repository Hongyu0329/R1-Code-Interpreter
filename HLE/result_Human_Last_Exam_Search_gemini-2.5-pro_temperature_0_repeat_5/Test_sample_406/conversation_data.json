    "An FGH-tripled fixed point for the functions F: X × Y × Z → X, G: Y × X × Y → Y, and H: Z × Y × X → Z is a point (x, y, z) ∈ X × Y × Z such that:\n\n*   F(x, y, z) = x\n*   G(y, x, y) = y\n*   H(z, y, x) = z\n\nThe existence and uniqueness of such a point are typically guaranteed under a set of conditions established within the framework of partially ordered metric spaces. These conditions ensure that sequences generated by iterating the functions converge to the fixed point.\n\nThe primary conditions for the existence of an FGH-tripled fixed point are:\n\n**1. Complete Metric Spaces:**\nThe sets X, Y, and Z must be equipped with metrics d_X, d_Y, and d_Z, respectively, forming complete metric spaces. A complete metric space is one in which every Cauchy sequence of points has a limit that is also a point within the space.\n\n**2. Partial Order:**\nThe spaces (X, ≤), (Y, ≤), and (Z, ≤) must be partially ordered sets. This means there is a relation ≤ defined on each set that is reflexive, antisymmetric, and transitive.\n\n**3. Mixed Monotone Property:**\nThe functions F, G, and H must satisfy a \"mixed monotone property.\" This property relates the ordering of the inputs to the ordering of the outputs. For F: X × Y × Z → X, G: Y × X × Y → Y, and H: Z × Y × X → Z, this property is defined as follows:\n*   **F** is monotone non-decreasing in its first argument and non-increasing in its second and third arguments.\n*   **G** is monotone non-decreasing in its first and third arguments and non-increasing in its second argument.\n*   **H** is monotone non-decreasing in its second argument and non-increasing in its first and third arguments.\n\n**4. Contractive Condition:**\nThe functions F, G, and H must satisfy a contractive condition. This condition ensures that the distances between the images of two points under the functions are smaller than the distances between the original points, scaled by some factor. A common form of this condition is:\nd_X(F(x₁, y₁, z₁), F(x₂, y₂, z₂)) + d_Y(G(y₁, x₁, y₁), G(y₂, x₂, y₂)) + d_Z(H(z₁, y₁, x₁), H(z₂, y₂, x₂)) ≤ k(d_X(x₁, x₂) + d_Y(y₁, y₂) + d_Z(z₁, z₂))\nfor all x₁, x₂ ∈ X, y₁, y₂ ∈ Y, z₁, z₂ ∈ Z for which x₁ ≤ x₂, y₂ ≤ y₁, z₁ ≤ z₂, where 0 ≤ k < 1 is a constant.\n\n**5. Existence of an Initial Point:**\nThere must exist initial points x₀ ∈ X, y₀ ∈ Y, and z₀ ∈ Z that satisfy the following order relations with their images under F, G, and H:\n*   x₀ ≤ F(x₀, y₀, z₀)\n*   y₀ ≥ G(y₀, x₀, y₀)\n*   z₀ ≤ H(z₀, y₀, x₀)\n\n**6. Continuity or Regularity:**\nEither the functions F, G, and H are continuous, or the space has a regularity property that ensures convergence. For instance, if a non-decreasing sequence converges, its limit is its supremum.\n\nWhen these conditions are met, the iterative sequences defined by:\n*   x_{n+1} = F(x_n, y_n, z_n)\n*   y_{n+1} = G(y_n, x_n, y_n)\n*   z_{n+1} = H(z_n, y_n, x_n)\n\nwill converge to a unique FGH-tripled fixed point (x, y, z). The concept of an FGH-tripled fixed point is a generalization of the tripled fixed point and an extension of the FG-coupled fixed point. These theoretical results have applications in solving systems of integral and differential equations.\n\n<<<An FGH-tripled fixed point for the functions F: X × Y × Z → X, G: Y × X × Y → Y, and H: Z × Y × X → Z is a point (x, y, z) such that F(x, y, z) = x, G(y, x, y) = y, and H(z, y, x) = z. The conditions for the existence of such a point are typically established in the context of partially ordered complete metric spaces and involve the following:\n\n1.  **Completeness of the Metric Spaces:** The spaces (X, d_X), (Y, d_Y), and (Z, d_Z) must be complete metric spaces.\n2.  **Mixed Monotone Property:** The functions F, G, and H must possess a mixed monotone property with respect to a partial order defined on the spaces.\n3.  **Contractive Condition:** The mappings must satisfy a contractive inequality that reduces the \"distance\" between triples of points.\n4.  **Existence of an Initial Point:** There must exist an initial triple (x₀, y₀, z₀) that satisfies a specific order relationship with its image under F, G, and H.\n5.  **Continuity:** The functions F, G, and H are often required to be continuous, or the space must satisfy a regularity condition to ensure the convergence of sequences to the fixed point.>>>"
