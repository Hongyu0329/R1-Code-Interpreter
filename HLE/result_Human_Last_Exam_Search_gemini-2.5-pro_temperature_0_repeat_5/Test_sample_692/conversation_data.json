    "## Earliest Recorded Date in the Americas Traced to Olmec Civilization\n\nThe earliest known date recorded by a pre-Columbian civilization in the Americas using an aboriginal writing system is believed to be **\"3 Ajaw,\"** corresponding to a day in the 260-day sacred calendar. This inscription was discovered on a ceramic cylinder seal from the Olmec site of San Andrés in the present-day Mexican state of Tabasco and is dated to approximately **650 BCE**.\n\nThe artifact depicts a bird with speech scrolls emanating from its beak, which contain the glyphs for the date. This discovery is significant as it suggests that the Olmec, considered the \"mother culture\" of Mesoamerica, had developed a sophisticated system of writing and calendrics centuries earlier than previously thought. The interpretation of the glyphs as a date is supported by many archaeologists, who also note that \"3 Ajaw\" could have functioned as the personal name of a ruler, a common practice in later Mesoamerican cultures.\n\nWhile the **Cascajal Block**, also from the Olmec civilization and dated to around 900 BCE, is widely considered the oldest example of writing in the New World, it does not contain any calendrical dates.\n\nOther early recorded dates in the Americas include a Zapotec monument from San José Mogote in Oaxaca, which bears the possible date \"1 Earthquake\" and is dated to before 500 BCE. This is later than the San Andrés find.\n\nAdditionally, the earliest known Maya calendar notation, \"7 Deer,\" was found on mural fragments at San Bartolo, Guatemala. These fragments are securely dated to between 300 and 200 BCE, making them significantly more recent than the Olmec inscription from San Andrés.\n\nAlthough there is some scholarly debate regarding the interpretation of the San Andrés glyphs, with a minority suggesting they could be purely iconographic, the prevailing view among many experts is that they represent the earliest known recorded date in the Americas.\n\n<<<\"3 Ajaw\" from the Olmec civilization, circa 650 BCE.>>>"
