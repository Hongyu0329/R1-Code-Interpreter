    "In the semidihedral group of size 512, there are 9 power subgroups.\n\nThe semidihedral group of order 512, denoted as SD_512, can be described by the presentation G = ⟨a, x | a²⁵⁶ = 1, x² = 1, xax⁻¹ = a¹²⁷⟩. A power subgroup Gⁿ is the subgroup generated by all n-th powers of the elements in G.\n\nThe set of power subgroups is determined by the powers of 2. For any integer q, if we write q = 2ᵏm where m is an odd number, the power subgroup G^q is the same as G^(2ᵏ). This is because the map g ↦ gᵐ is an automorphism for any 2-group, so it does not change the generated subgroup.\n\nTherefore, we only need to identify the distinct subgroups in the sequence G¹, G², G⁴, G⁸, and so on.\n\nThe elements of SD_512 are of the form aⁱ or aⁱx. The powers of these elements are as follows:\n*   (aⁱ)ⁿ = aⁱⁿ\n*   (aⁱx)² = a¹²⁸ⁱ, and consequently (aⁱx)ⁿ is the identity element if n is a multiple of 4.\n\nBased on this, the sequence of power subgroups is:\n*   **G¹ = G**: The entire semidihedral group of order 512.\n*   **G²**: This subgroup is generated by the squares of all elements. The squares are of the form a²ⁱ and a¹²⁸ⁱ. This generates the cyclic subgroup ⟨a²⟩, which has an order of 128.\n*   **G⁴**: This subgroup is generated by the fourth powers of all elements. The fourth powers are of the form a⁴ⁱ and the identity element. This generates the cyclic subgroup ⟨a⁴⟩, which has an order of 64.\n*   **G⁸ = ⟨a⁸⟩**: A cyclic subgroup of order 32.\n*   **G¹⁶ = ⟨a¹⁶⟩**: A cyclic subgroup of order 16.\n*   **G³² = ⟨a³²⟩**: A cyclic subgroup of order 8.\n*   **G⁶⁴ = ⟨a⁶⁴⟩**: A cyclic subgroup of order 4.\n*   **G¹²⁸ = ⟨a¹²⁸⟩**: A cyclic subgroup of order 2.\n*   **G²⁵⁶ = {e}**: The trivial subgroup of order 1, as the order of every element divides 256.\n\nThese nine subgroups are all distinct, and any other power subgroup Gⁿ will be identical to one of these.\n\n<<<9>>>"
