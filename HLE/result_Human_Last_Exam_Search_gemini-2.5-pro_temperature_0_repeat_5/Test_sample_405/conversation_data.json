    "Pure allotropes of phosphorus can be observed in four main colors: white, red, violet, and black.\n\nThe most common allotropes are white and red phosphorus. White phosphorus is a translucent, waxy solid that appears white, but can yellow with exposure to light, leading to it sometimes being called yellow phosphorus. However, this yellow coloration is due to the degradation of white phosphorus into red phosphorus.\n\nRed phosphorus is an amorphous or crystalline solid that is less reactive than the white form. Its color is, as the name suggests, red.\n\nViolet phosphorus, also known as Hittorf's phosphorus, is a crystalline form that can be produced by annealing red phosphorus at high temperatures. Its color is described as red/purple or violet.\n\nBlack phosphorus is the most stable allotrope and has a graphite-like appearance, being black and flaky. It exists in two forms, α-black and β-black, both of which are black in color.\n\nIn addition to these solid allotropes, gaseous diphosphorus (P₂) exists, and at very high temperatures, it dissociates into atomic phosphorus. However, the observable colors are primarily associated with the solid allotropes. Therefore, the distinct colors of pure phosphorus allotropes are white, red, violet, and black.\n\n<<<4>>>"
