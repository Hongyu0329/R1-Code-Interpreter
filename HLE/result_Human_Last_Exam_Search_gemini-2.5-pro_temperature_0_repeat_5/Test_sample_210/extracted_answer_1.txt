Between 1803 and 1823, the number of settlers on Colonel Thomas Talbot's land grant grew to encompass at least 804 families by 1817, though a precise figure for 1823 is not available. By 1821, Talbot had expanded his personal land holdings to over 65,000 acres, making it more than 60,000 acres larger than his original 5,000-acre grant.
