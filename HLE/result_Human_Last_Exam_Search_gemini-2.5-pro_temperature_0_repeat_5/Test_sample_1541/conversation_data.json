    "Here is the most memory-efficient C program to solve the problem, along with an explanation of its memory usage.\n\nThe optimal approach is to read the input sum character by character, without storing the entire string in memory. This avoids the need for a large buffer (which could be up to 1001 bytes). We can use a small array to count the occurrences of each number (1, 2, 3, and 4). This method is a form of Counting Sort.\n\nAfter counting, we can directly print the sorted sum by iterating through our counts and printing the numbers in non-decreasing order. To minimize memory usage further, the smallest possible standard data types are used for each variable.\n\n### Most Memory-Efficient C Program\n\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n\n/**\n * This program rearranges the summands in a given sum string (containing only\n * numbers 1, 2, 3, 4) in non-decreasing order.\n *\n * It employs a memory-efficient strategy by processing the input character\n * by character, avoiding the need to store the entire string.\n */\nint main() {\n    // Use 'short' for the counts array. The maximum number of any digit is\n    // less than 1000, which fits within a short's range.\n    // Memory: 4 * sizeof(short) = 4 * 2 = 8 bytes.\n    short counts[4] = {0};\n\n    // 'getchar()' returns an 'int' to handle the special EOF value.\n    // Memory: sizeof(int) = 4 bytes.\n    int c;\n\n    // Read the input character by character until the end of the line or file.\n    while ((c = getchar()) != '\\n' && c != EOF) {\n        // If the character is a digit, increment the corresponding counter.\n        // '1' is mapped to index 0, '2' to 1, and so on.\n        if (c >= '1' && c <= '4') {\n            counts[c - '1']++;\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Use 'char' for the flag, as it only needs to store 0 or 1.\n    // Memory: sizeof(char) = 1 byte.\n    char is_first_term = 1;\n\n    // Loop variables can be 'short' as their values will be very small.\n    // Memory: sizeof(short) = 2 bytes.\n    short i;\n    // Memory: sizeof(short) = 2 bytes.\n    short j;\n\n    // Construct and print the new sum.\n    for (i = 0; i < 4; i++) {\n        for (j = 0; j < counts[i]; j++) {\n            // For the very first number, don't print a '+' before it.\n            if (is_first_term) {\n                printf(\"%d\", i + 1);\n                is_first_term = 0;\n            } else {\n                printf(\"+%d\", i + 1);\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    printf(\"\\n\");\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Memory Usage Calculation (m)\n\nThe total memory `m` is the sum of the memory allocated for all variables in the `main` function. The calculation assumes a common architecture where `sizeof(int)` is 4 bytes, `sizeof(short)` is 2 bytes, and `sizeof(char)` is 1 byte.\n\n*   **`short counts[4]`**: An array of 4 short integers to count the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n    *   Memory = 4 * `sizeof(short)` = 4 * 2 = 8 bytes.\n*   **`int c`**: An integer variable to store the character read by `getchar()`. It must be an `int` to correctly handle the `EOF` (End-of-File) value.\n    *   Memory = `sizeof(int)` = 4 bytes.\n*   **`char is_first_term`**: A character used as a boolean flag (0 or 1) to manage the printing of the `+` symbol.\n    *   Memory = `sizeof(char)` = 1 byte.\n*   **`short i`**: A short integer for the outer loop counter (from 0 to 3).\n    *   Memory = `sizeof(short)` = 2 bytes.\n*   **`short j`**: A short integer for the inner loop counter.\n    *   Memory = `sizeof(short)` = 2 bytes.\n\nThe total memory `m` is the sum of these amounts:\n\nm = 8 (counts) + 4 (c) + 1 (is\\_first\\_term) + 2 (i) + 2 (j) = **17 bytes**\n\n<<<17>>>"
