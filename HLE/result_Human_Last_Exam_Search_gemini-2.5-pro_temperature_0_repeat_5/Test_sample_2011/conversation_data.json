    "The maximum possible number of different clique sizes that can simultaneously appear as induced subgraphs of a single graph on n=128 vertices is 128.\n\nHere is a step-by-step determination of this value:\n\n1.  **Understanding the Terminology**:\n    *   A **clique** in a graph is a subset of vertices where every two distinct vertices are connected by an edge.\n    *   An **induced subgraph** on a subset of vertices consists of those vertices and all the edges that connect them in the original graph.\n    *   A \"clique of size k\" that is an \"induced subgraph\" means there is a set of `k` vertices in the graph such that the subgraph induced by them is a complete graph (K_k).\n\n2.  **Relating Different Clique Sizes**:\n    A crucial observation is that if a graph `G` contains an induced clique of a certain size `k`, it must also contain induced cliques of all smaller integer sizes from 1 to `k`. This is because if you have a set of `k` vertices that form a complete graph, any subset of these `k` vertices will also form a complete graph. For any integer `j` between 1 and `k`, you can simply select `j` vertices from the `k`-vertex clique to form an induced clique of size `j`.\n\n3.  **Simplifying the Problem**:\n    From the point above, the set of all possible induced clique sizes in any graph `G` will always be of the form `{1, 2, 3, ..., ω(G)}`, where `ω(G)` (the clique number) is the size of the largest possible clique in `G`. Therefore, the number of different clique sizes is equal to the clique number, `ω(G)`. The problem is now reduced to finding the maximum possible clique number for a graph with 128 vertices.\n\n4.  **Maximizing the Clique Number**:\n    For any graph with `n` vertices, the size of the largest clique cannot exceed `n`. In this case, for a graph with 128 vertices, the clique number `ω(G)` must be less than or equal to 128.\n\n5.  **Achieving the Maximum**:\n    This maximum possible clique number is achieved by the **complete graph** on 128 vertices, denoted as `K_128`. In this graph, all 128 vertices are connected to each other, so the entire set of vertices forms a clique of size 128. Thus, `ω(K_128) = 128`.\n\n6.  **Conclusion**:\n    Since the complete graph `K_128` has a clique number of 128, it contains induced cliques of all sizes from 1 to 128. This gives a total of 128 different clique sizes. As no graph on 128 vertices can have a clique number greater than 128, this is the maximum possible number.\n\nIt is important to note that this question is about all possible induced cliques, not just *maximal* cliques (cliques that cannot be extended). The problem of finding the maximum number of different *maximal* clique sizes is a more complex and different question.\n\n<<<128>>>"
