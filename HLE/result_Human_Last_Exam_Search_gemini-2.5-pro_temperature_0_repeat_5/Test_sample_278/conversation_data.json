    "To determine the area of the smallest square that encloses the figure, we first need to find the extent of the curve in the x and y directions.\n\nThe curve is defined in two parts:\n\n**Part 1: For $t \\in [0, \\pi]$**\nThe parametric equations are $x = \\cos t$ and $y = \\sin t$.\nThis represents the upper half of a unit circle centered at the origin.\n*   The x-values range from $\\cos(\\pi) = -1$ to $\\cos(0) = 1$.\n*   The y-values range from $\\sin(0) = 0$ to a maximum of $\\sin(\\pi/2) = 1$ and back to $\\sin(\\pi) = 0$.\nSo, for this part, the range of x is $[-1, 1]$ and the range of y is $$.\n\n**Part 2: For $t \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$**\nThe parametric equations are $x = \\cos t$ and $y = 5\\sin t$.\nThis represents the lower half of an ellipse centered at the origin with a horizontal semi-axis of 1 and a vertical semi-axis of 5.\n*   The x-values range from $\\cos(\\pi) = -1$ to $\\cos(2\\pi) = 1$.\n*   The y-values range from $5\\sin(\\pi) = 0$ to a minimum of $5\\sin(3\\pi/2) = -5$ and back to $5\\sin(2\\pi) = 0$.\nSo, for this part, the range of x is $[-1, 1]$ and the range of y is $[-5, 0]$.\n\n**Combining both parts:**\nTo find the full extent of the figure, we combine the ranges for x and y.\n*   The total range for x is the union of $[-1, 1]$ and $[-1, 1]$, which is $[-1, 1]$. The width of the figure is the difference between the maximum and minimum x-values: $1 - (-1) = 2$.\n*   The total range for y is the union of $$ and $[-5, 0]$, which is $[-5, 1]$. The height of the figure is the difference between the maximum and minimum y-values: $1 - (-5) = 6$.\n\nThe figure is contained within a bounding rectangle of width 2 and height 6. The smallest square that can enclose this rectangle must have a side length equal to the larger of these two dimensions.\n\nSide length of the smallest enclosing square = $\\max(\\text{width}, \\text{height}) = \\max(2, 6) = 6$.\n\nThe area of this square is the side length squared.\n\nArea = $6^2 = 36$.\n\n<<<36>>>"
