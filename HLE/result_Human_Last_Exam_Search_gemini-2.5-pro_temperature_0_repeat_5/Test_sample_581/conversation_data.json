    "The best-known lower bound for the size of a cap set in dimension $n$, denoted as $C(n,3)$, is the size of the largest known subset of the affine space $AG(n,3) = (\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z})^n$ that contains no three points on a line. For dimensions greater than 6, the exact maximum size is not known, and researchers rely on constructions to establish lower bounds.\n\nThe sizes of maximal caps for dimensions up to 6 are known:\n*   $C(1,3) = 2$\n*   $C(2,3) = 4$\n*   $C(3,3) = 9$\n*   $C(4,3) = 20$\n*   $C(5,3) = 45$\n*   $C(6,3) = 112$\n\nA straightforward method to find a lower bound for higher dimensions is the product construction, where $C(n+m, 3) \\ge C(n,3) \\times C(m,3)$. For dimension 8, this yields:\n$C(8,3) \\ge C(2,3) \\times C(6,3) = 4 \\times 112 = 448$.\n\nHowever, more advanced methods can provide better bounds. One such method is the \"doubling construction,\" which states that a cap of size $n$ in the projective space $PG(d,q)$ can be used to construct a cap of size $2n$ in the affine space $AG(d+1,q)$.\n\nTo find a lower bound for $AG(8,3)$, we can use a known large cap from $PG(7,3)$. According to tables of best-known cap sizes maintained by experts in the field, such as Yves Edel, there is a known cap of size at least 248 in $PG(7,3)$. This result is attributed to a construction by Davydov and Östergård.\n\nApplying the doubling construction to this cap:\nSize in $AG(8,3) \\ge 2 \\times (\\text{Size in } PG(7,3)) = 2 \\times 248 = 496$.\n\nThis construction gives a lower bound of 496, which is better than the 448 obtained from the simple product construction. Among the given choices, 496 is the best-known lower bound presented.\n\n<<<F>>>"
