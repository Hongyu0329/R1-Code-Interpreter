    "The question asks for the exact number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a reductive group $G$ of type $E_8$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$.\n\nFirst, it is important to clarify whether the question is about the total number of such tori or the number of conjugacy classes of such tori. In the context of algebraic groups, \"the number of\" a certain type of subgroup often refers to the number of conjugacy classes. All maximal tori in a connected reductive group over an algebraically closed field are conjugate. However, over a non-algebraically closed field like $\\mathbb{F}_q$, this is not necessarily true. The $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori fall into a finite number of conjugacy classes under the action of the group of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational points, $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$.\n\nThe set of $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$-conjugacy classes of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori is in one-to-one correspondence with the set of $F$-conjugacy classes of the Weyl group $W$, where $F$ is the Frobenius endomorphism associated with the $\\mathbb{F}_q$-structure.\n\nFor a group of type $E_8$, the Dynkin diagram has no non-trivial automorphisms. This implies that any reductive group of type $E_8$ over a field is split. For a split group, the Frobenius endomorphism acts trivially on the Weyl group. In this case, the $F$-conjugacy classes are simply the ordinary conjugacy classes of the Weyl group $W$.\n\nTherefore, the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational conjugacy classes of maximal tori of $G$ is equal to the number of conjugacy classes of the Weyl group of $E_8$, denoted $W(E_8)$.\n\nThe Weyl group $W(E_8)$ is a finite group of order 696,729,600. The number of its conjugacy classes has been computed. According to R.W. Carter's work in 1972, the number of conjugacy classes in the Weyl group of type $E_8$ is 112.\n\nThus, there are 112 distinct conjugacy classes of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori in a reductive group of type $E_8$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$.\n\nIf the question were to be interpreted as the total number of such tori (as subgroups), the answer would be a polynomial in $q$. The number of tori in each conjugacy class is given by the index of the normalizer of a torus in that class within the group $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$. The order of $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$ is a well-known polynomial in $q$, and the orders of the normalizers of the tori are also polynomials in $q$. Summing these up over all 112 conjugacy classes would give the total number, which would be a rather complicated polynomial in $q$. Given the phrasing, it is most likely that the question refers to the number of conjugacy classes.\n\n<<<112>>>"
