    "In the ϕ⁴ theory near four dimensions, specifically in d = 4 - ε dimensions, the renormalization group flow of the coupling constant, u, is described by the beta function, β(u). The fixed points of the theory are the values of the coupling, u*, for which the beta function is zero, i.e., β(u*) = 0. These fixed points govern the critical behavior of the system.\n\nThe one-loop beta function for the ϕ⁴ theory with a single scalar field (N=1) is given by:\n\nβ(u) = -εu + (3u²)/(16π²)\n\nSetting the beta function to zero allows us to solve for the non-trivial fixed point, known as the Wilson-Fisher fixed point:\n\n-εu* + (3(u*)²)/(16π²) = 0\n\nIgnoring the trivial solution u* = 0, we find the leading order expression for the fixed point coupling u* in terms of ε:\n\nu* = (16π²/3)ε\n\nThis result is valid to the first order in the ε-expansion. Higher-order corrections in ε can be calculated to obtain a more accurate value for the fixed point.\n\n<<<u* = (16π²/3)ε>>>"
