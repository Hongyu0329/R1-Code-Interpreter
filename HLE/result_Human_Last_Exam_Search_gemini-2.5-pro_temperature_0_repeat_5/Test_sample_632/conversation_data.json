    "Until 1883, the Pantheon in Rome's Piazza della Rotonda was flanked by two small bell towers. These were removed by the city administration, significantly altering the building's silhouette.\n\nThe bell towers were added in the 17th century, likely during the papacy of Urban VIII, and are often attributed to the famous architect Gian Lorenzo Bernini. However, they were not a universally beloved addition. In fact, they were unpopular with the Roman populace, who gave them the derogatory nickname \"le orecchie d'asino,\" which translates to \"the ass's ears.\"\n\nIn the late 19th century, between 1881 and 1883, a series of architectural interventions were carried out to \"free\" the Pantheon from various additions and isolate it from surrounding structures. It was during this period that the two bell towers were demolished. This action was part of a broader effort to restore the Pantheon to a perceived earlier, more classical appearance.\n\nWhile the user's query specifies the year 1950, historical records indicate the removal of this unique architectural feature occurred in the 1880s. It is possible the date in the query was a slight inaccuracy, with the \"ass's ears\" being the prominent feature that was removed.\n\n<<<the two bell towers, nicknamed \"the ass's ears\">>>"
