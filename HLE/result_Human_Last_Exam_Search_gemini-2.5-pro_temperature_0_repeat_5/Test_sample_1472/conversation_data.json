    "The symmetry point group of bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper depends on the oxidation state of the copper atom, which determines the overall geometry of the molecule. The two most common forms are the copper(I) and copper(II) complexes, each with a distinct structure and point group.\n\n### Bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper(I)\n\nThe copper(I) complex, [Cu(2,5-dithiahexane)₂]⁺, features a copper ion coordinated to two bis(2,5-dithiahexane) ligands. The geometry around the copper(I) ion is described as a distorted tetrahedron. The cation possesses a four-fold improper rotation axis (S₄), and its point group is **S₄**. The structure has a compact, nearly spherical shape which results from the folding of the ligands around the central copper atom.\n\n### Bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper(II)\n\nThe copper(II) complex, often found as [Cu(2,5-dithiahexane)₂(anion)₂] such as with tetrafluoroborate (BF₄⁻) or perchlorate (ClO₄⁻) anions, exhibits a different geometry. In this case, the copper(II) ion is in a distorted octahedral environment. The four sulfur atoms from the two dithiahexane ligands are arranged in a plane around the copper atom, with two anions weakly coordinated in the axial positions. Crucially, the copper atom is located on a center of inversion. The presence of an inversion center as the primary symmetry element (besides identity) assigns the molecule to the **Cᵢ** point group.\n\nIn summary, the point group of bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper is:\n*   **S₄** for the copper(I) complex.\n*   **Cᵢ** for the copper(II) complex.\n\n<<<S₄ for the copper(I) complex and Cᵢ for the copper(II) complex.>>>"
