    "Ni-Ceria nanoparticles have emerged as highly promising catalysts for both the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction and water splitting (WS) applications, owing to the synergistic interaction between nickel and ceria. However, the ideal Ni/Ce ratio to maximize catalytic performance is not a single value but rather depends on the specific reaction and the preparation method of the catalyst.\n\n### Water Gas Shift (WGS) Reaction\n\nFor the WGS reaction, which is crucial for producing high-purity hydrogen, the optimal nickel content generally falls within a range of 7 to 15 wt%.\n\n-  A study on Ni/CeO₂ catalysts found that while there was no significant difference in the initiation temperature for the WGS reaction for nickel content ranging from 5 to 12.5 wt%, catalysts with 10 and 12.5 wt% Ni demonstrated nearly identical and high CO conversion rates of 94.7% and 95.3%, respectively, at 400 °C. The highest CO conversion of 97.8% was achieved with the 12.5 wt% Ni/CeO₂ catalyst at 400 °C.\n-  In the context of the reverse WGS (rWGS) reaction, research on Ni/La-doped Ceria catalysts identified an optimal nickel proportion of around 7% molar.\n-  Another investigation into NiO/CeO₂ catalysts for CO oxidation, a related reaction, reported that a 15 wt% NiO/CeO₂ catalyst was both active and stable. In contrast, catalysts with higher NiO concentrations of 20 and 30 wt% showed deactivation at temperatures of 130 °C and above.\n\n### Water Splitting (WS)\n\nIn the case of water splitting, which involves the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), the ideal Ni/Ce ratio can vary significantly.\n\n-  For the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), a study on NiyCe100−yOx electrocatalysts revealed that catalysts with atomic ratios of Ni75Ce25Ox (a 3:1 Ni/Ce ratio) and Ni50Ce50Ox (a 1:1 Ni/Ce ratio) exhibited the highest OER activities. This enhanced performance was attributed to a larger concentration of oxygen vacancies, leading to lower Tafel slopes and greater electrochemical surface areas.\n-  For the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), research on Ni₃N-CeO₂/NF nanoparticles indicated that a Ce/Ni molar ratio of 2, which corresponds to a **Ni/Ce ratio of 0.5**, yielded the best performance.\n-  A computational study investigating Ni-Ceria nanoparticles for water splitting suggested that a **3Ni/1Ce ratio** (Ni/Ce = 3) results in more favorable adsorption energy, indicating better catalytic properties for the overall water-splitting reaction.\n-  In a more complex system involving Ni and Fe co-doping in ceria, a high level of 20 mol% total dopants with a 1:1 ratio of Ni to Fe showed excellent HER and OER activities.\n\nIn summary, the ideal Ni/Ce ratio is highly dependent on the target application. For the WGS reaction, a nickel content in the range of **7-12.5 wt%** appears to be optimal. For water splitting, the ideal ratio differs for the HER and OER half-reactions, with a **Ni/Ce ratio of 0.5** being favorable for HER and ratios of **1:1 to 3:1** showing promise for OER. Computational studies also support a **3:1 Ni/Ce ratio** for overall water splitting.\n\n<<<The ideal Ni/Ce ratio for maximizing catalytic performance in Ni-Ceria nanoparticles differs for the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction and water splitting (WS). For the WGS reaction, an optimal range is typically between 7 and 12.5 wt% of Nickel. For water splitting, the ideal ratio varies further depending on the specific half-reaction: a Ni/Ce ratio of approximately 0.5 is optimal for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), while ratios between 1:1 and 3:1 are more effective for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER).>>>"
