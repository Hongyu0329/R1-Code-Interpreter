The ideal Ni/Ce ratio for maximizing catalytic performance in Ni-Ceria nanoparticles differs for the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction and water splitting (WS). For the WGS reaction, an optimal range is typically between 7 and 12.5 wt% of Nickel. For water splitting, the ideal ratio varies further depending on the specific half-reaction: a Ni/Ce ratio of approximately 0.5 is optimal for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), while ratios between 1:1 and 3:1 are more effective for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER).
