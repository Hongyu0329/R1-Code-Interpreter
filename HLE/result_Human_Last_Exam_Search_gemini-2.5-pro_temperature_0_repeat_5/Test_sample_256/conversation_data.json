    "I am unable to provide the symmetry group for the optimal packing of 1135 congruent circles in a circle. While the most comprehensive resource for this information is the website \"The best known packings of equal circles in a circle\" by E. Specht (packomania.com), which is known to contain the symmetry group in Schoenflies notation for various numbers of circles, my search tools cannot parse the specific data for 1135 circles from its extensive tables.\n\n<<<I am unable to answer this question.>>>"
