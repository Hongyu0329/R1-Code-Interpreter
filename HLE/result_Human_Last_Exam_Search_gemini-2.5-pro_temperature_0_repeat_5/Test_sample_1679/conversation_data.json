    "An American in Paris, the 1951 Academy Award winner for Best Picture, is the first film to hold that honor and feature a depiction of the Luxor Obelisk. The film includes an extended ballet sequence set in a stylized representation of various Parisian locations, including the Place de la Concorde, where the Luxor Obelisk is prominently situated.\n\nThe seventeen-minute ballet finale of the musical, starring Gene Kelly and Leslie Caron, showcases a dance number around a fountain in the Place de la Concorde. A model of the fountain was created for the production to plan the choreography and camera angles for this scene. While much of the film was shot on meticulously crafted sets at MGM studios in California, the inclusion of this iconic Parisian landmark is a key feature of the film's celebrated closing sequence.\n\nPrior Best Picture winners were set in various locations around the world, but none featured the famous Egyptian monument. Earlier films either had no scenes in Paris or, if they did, did not include shots of the Place de la Concorde. For instance, *Around the World in 80 Days* (1956) and *Gigi* (1958), both subsequent Best Picture winners set in Paris, do not feature the obelisk in their depicted locations.\n\n<<<An American in Paris>>>"
