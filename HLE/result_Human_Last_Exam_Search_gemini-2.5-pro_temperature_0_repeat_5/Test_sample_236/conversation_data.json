    "### Four Distinct Elements in Homology Cobordism Group from Simple Knots\n\nFrom the set of knots with four or fewer crossings, precisely four distinct elements of the homology cobordism group can be generated through the process of integral surgery. These elements arise from ±1 surgery on the unknot, the trefoil knot, and the figure-eight knot.\n\nThe knots with a crossing number of four or less are the unknot (0₁), the trefoil knot (3₁), and the figure-eight knot (4₁). For an integral surgery on a knot to produce a 3-manifold with the same integer homology as a 3-sphere (an integral homology sphere), the surgery coefficient must be either +1 or -1. Analyzing these specific surgeries for each knot yields the following distinct elements in the homology cobordism group, which classifies 3-dimensional homology spheres based on when their difference forms the boundary of a 4-dimensional homology \"cylinder\".\n\nThe four elements are:\n1.  **The 3-sphere (S³)**: This is the identity element of the group. It is produced by both +1 and -1 surgery on the unknot.\n2.  **The Poincaré Homology Sphere**: This manifold is generated by performing a +1 surgery on the right-handed trefoil knot (3₁). It is a well-known homology sphere with an infinite order in the homology cobordism group.\n3.  **The Mirror Poincaré Homology Sphere**: The inverse element to the Poincaré sphere is obtained by performing a -1 surgery on the right-handed trefoil knot. This results in a manifold that is the mirror image of the one from +1 surgery, and it is distinct from it in the homology cobordism group.\n4.  **The Weber-Seifert Dodecahedral Space**: This homology sphere is the result of both +1 and -1 surgery on the figure-eight knot (4₁). The figure-eight knot is amphichiral (indistinguishable from its mirror image), which leads to both surgeries producing the same manifold. This element is distinct from the others and has an order of 2 in the homology cobordism group, meaning the connected sum of the space with itself bounds a homology cylinder.\n\nThe classification of these elements relies on sophisticated invariants such as the Rokhlin invariant and Heegaard Floer homology correction terms (d-invariants). While both the 3-sphere and the Weber-Seifert space have a Rokhlin invariant of 0, they are known to be distinct elements. The Poincaré sphere and its mirror have non-trivial Rokhlin invariants, distinguishing them from the other two and each other.\n\n<<<4>>>"
