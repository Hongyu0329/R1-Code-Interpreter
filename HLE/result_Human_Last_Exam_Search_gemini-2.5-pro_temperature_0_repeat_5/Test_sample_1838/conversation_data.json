    "To find the central pixel of the line between (1,1) and (11,5) using Bresenham's line algorithm, we first need to generate all the pixel coordinates that form the line.\n\nThe line starts at (x1, y1) = (1, 1) and ends at (x2, y2) = (11, 5).\n\nFirst, we calculate the change in x and y:\n*   Δx = x2 - x1 = 11 - 1 = 10\n*   Δy = y2 - y1 = 5 - 1 = 4\n\nSince Δx > Δy and both are positive, the line's slope is between 0 and 1. In each step of the algorithm, we will increment x by 1 and decide whether to increment y based on a decision parameter.\n\nThe initial decision parameter (p) is calculated as:\np = 2 * Δy - Δx = 2 * 4 - 10 = -2\n\nThe algorithm proceeds as follows, starting from the initial point (1,1):\n\n1.  **Point (1,1):** The starting point.\n2.  **x = 2:** Since p (-2) < 0, the next point is (2,1). The new p = -2 + (2 * Δy) = -2 + 8 = 6.\n3.  **x = 3:** Since p (6) >= 0, the next point is (3,2). The new p = 6 + (2 * Δy) - (2 * Δx) = 6 + 8 - 20 = -6.\n4.  **x = 4:** Since p (-6) < 0, the next point is (4,2). The new p = -6 + 8 = 2.\n5.  **x = 5:** Since p (2) >= 0, the next point is (5,3). The new p = 2 + 8 - 20 = -10.\n6.  **x = 6:** Since p (-10) < 0, the next point is (6,3). The new p = -10 + 8 = -2.\n7.  **x = 7:** Since p (-2) < 0, the next point is (7,3). The new p = -2 + 8 = 6.\n8.  **x = 8:** Since p (6) >= 0, the next point is (8,4). The new p = 6 + 8 - 20 = -6.\n9.  **x = 9:** Since p (-6) < 0, the next point is (9,4). The new p = -6 + 8 = 2.\n10. **x = 10:** Since p (2) >= 0, the next point is (10,5). The new p = 2 + 8 - 20 = -10.\n11. **x = 11:** Since p (-10) < 0, the next point is (11,5).\n\nThe complete list of pixels generated by the algorithm is:\n(1,1), (2,1), (3,2), (4,2), (5,3), (6,3), (7,3), (8,4), (9,4), (10,5), (11,5)\n\nThere are a total of 11 pixels in this line. The central pixel is the 6th one in the sequence.\n\nThe 6th pixel in the list is (6,3).\n\nInterestingly, the mathematical midpoint of the line segment is ((1+11)/2, (1+5)/2) = (6, 3), which in this case coincides with one of the pixels generated by the algorithm.\n\n<<<(6, 3)>>>"
