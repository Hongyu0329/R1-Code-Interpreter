    "Let C be a Riemann surface of genus g=3 and X be its 15th symmetric power, denoted as C^(15). The rank of the Néron-Severi group of X, denoted by ρ(X), is also known as the Picard number.\n\nFor a symmetric power of a curve C^(d), when the degree d is greater than or equal to the genus g, the Picard number of C^(d) is equal to the Picard number of the Jacobian variety of the curve, J(C). In this case, d=15 and g=3, so the condition d ≥ g is satisfied. Therefore, we have ρ(C^(15)) = ρ(J(C)). The problem is thus reduced to finding the smallest and largest possible values for the rank of the Néron-Severi group of the Jacobian of a genus 3 curve.\n\n### Smallest Possible Rank\n\nThe rank of the Néron-Severi group of an abelian variety is always at least 1, with the class of the principal polarization being a non-trivial element. For a \"very general\" curve C of genus g, the endomorphism ring of its Jacobian J(C) is simply the integers, End(J(C)) = ℤ. In this situation, the Néron-Severi group is generated by the class of the theta divisor, and its rank is 1. Therefore, the smallest possible rank of the Néron-Severi group of X is 1.\n\n### Largest Possible Rank\n\nThe rank of the Néron-Severi group of an abelian variety A of dimension g is bounded by the Hodge number h¹¹(A), which is equal to g². For the Jacobian of a genus 3 curve, this upper bound is 3² = 9. This maximum rank is achieved if the Jacobian is of CM-type, meaning it has complex multiplication.\n\nThe existence of a genus 3 curve whose Jacobian has a Néron-Severi group of rank 9 is well-established. A prominent example is the Fermat quartic curve, defined by the equation x⁴ + y⁴ + z⁴ = 0. This is a smooth curve of genus 3. Its Jacobian is known to be isogenous to the cube of an elliptic curve with complex multiplication by the Gaussian integers ℤ[i]. For this specific Jacobian, the rank of the Néron-Severi group is indeed 9.\n\nTherefore, the largest possible rank for the Néron-Severi group of X is 9.\n\n<<<The smallest possible rank is 1, and the largest possible rank is 9.>>>"
