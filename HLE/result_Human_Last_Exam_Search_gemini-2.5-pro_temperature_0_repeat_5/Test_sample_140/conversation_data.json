    "The largest number of 9 by 1 by 1 blocks that will fit inside a cube of edge length 15 is 351.\n\nThis can be determined by a logical packing strategy. The volume of the cube is 15x15x15 = 3375 cubic units, and the volume of each block is 9x1x1 = 9 cubic units. Dividing the total volume of the cube by the volume of a block gives a theoretical maximum of 3375 / 9 = 375 blocks. However, this does not account for the geometric constraints of packing.\n\nA practical method to fit the blocks is as follows:\n1.  First, a section of the cube measuring 15x15x9 can be filled. By aligning the 9-unit length of the blocks with the 9-unit dimension of this section, we can fit 15 x 15 x 1 = 225 blocks. This leaves a remaining space of 15x15x6.\n\n2.  Next, within the remaining 15x15x6 space, no block can be aligned along the 6-unit dimension. We can, however, fill a subsection of 15x9x6. By aligning the blocks' 9-unit length with the 9-unit dimension, we can fit 15 x 1 x 6 = 90 blocks. This leaves a smaller space of 15x6x6.\n\n3.  In the remaining 15x6x6 space, the blocks must be aligned along the 15-unit dimension. We can fill a 9x6x6 section, which accommodates 1 x 6 x 6 = 36 blocks.\n\n4.  This leaves a final remaining space of 6x6x6. No 9x1x1 block can fit into this volume, as all its dimensions are smaller than 9.\n\nSumming the blocks from each step gives the total: 225 + 90 + 36 = 351 blocks.\n\n<<<351>>>"
