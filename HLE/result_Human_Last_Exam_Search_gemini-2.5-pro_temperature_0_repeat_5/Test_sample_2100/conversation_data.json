    "Andrei Voznesensky's poem, which later became the rock opera \"Juno and Avos,\" tells the story of the Russian diplomat and explorer Nikolai Rezanov. The work chronicles his ill-fated romance with María de la Concepción Argüello, the daughter of the Spanish governor of Alta California.\n\nThe line \"Where is your grave, even a mound?\" refers to Rezanov, who died of fever and exhaustion in Krasnoyarsk, Siberia, in 1807 while on his return journey to St. Petersburg. His original gravesite was lost. In the late 20th century, interest in Rezanov's story was revived, and a new memorial was erected on his presumed burial site in Krasnoyarsk in October 2000.\n\n<<<Rezanov>>>"
