    "The search results confirm the initial interpretation.\n\n*   **Barbell Graph Structure:** A barbell graph with `2n` nodes is formed by two complete graphs (cliques) of `n` nodes, `K_n`, connected by a single edge, called a bridge or bottleneck. For a 10-node barbell graph, we have two `K_5` cliques.\n*   **Randomized Uniform Gossiping:** The standard model, also referred to as uniform pairwise gossiping, involves a node being selected uniformly at random from the entire network, which then contacts one of its neighbors, also chosen uniformly at random. This matches the process assumed in the initial calculation. The process is also equivalent to a random walk on the graph.\n\nThe calculation steps are as follows:\n\n1.  **Define the Graph:**\n    *   Total nodes `N = 10`.\n    *   The graph consists of two `K_5` cliques (let's call them A and B).\n    *   A single \"bottleneck\" edge connects one node from clique A (let's call it `u`) to one node from clique B (let's call it `v`).\n\n2.  **Determine Node Degrees:**\n    *   In a `K_5`, each node is connected to the other 4 nodes.\n    *   Node `u` is connected to 4 nodes in clique A and to node `v`. So, `degree(u) = 4 + 1 = 5`.\n    *   Similarly, node `v` is connected to 4 nodes in clique B and to node `u`. So, `degree(v) = 4 + 1 = 5`.\n    *   Any other node in clique A (4 of them) is connected only to the other 4 nodes within clique A. Their degree is 4.\n    *   Any other node in clique B (4 of them) is connected only to the other 4 nodes within clique B. Their degree is 4.\n\n3.  **Define the Gossiping Process:**\n    *   At each step, a node `i` is chosen uniformly at random from the 10 nodes. The probability of choosing any specific node is `1/10`.\n    *   The chosen node `i` then selects a neighbor `j` to communicate with, uniformly at random from its set of neighbors. The probability of this is `1 / degree(i)`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Probability of Sampling the Bottleneck Edge:**\n    *   The bottleneck edge `(u, v)` is \"sampled\" if either node `u` chooses to contact `v`, or node `v` chooses to contact `u`. These are the only two ways this can happen.\n    *   **Case 1: Node `u` contacts node `v`**\n        *   The probability of selecting node `u` is `1/10`.\n        *   Given `u` is selected, the probability it contacts `v` is `1 / degree(u) = 1/5`.\n        *   The probability of this entire event is `(1/10) * (1/5) = 1/50`.\n    *   **Case 2: Node `v` contacts node `u`**\n        *   The probability of selecting node `v` is `1/10`.\n        *   Given `v` is selected, the probability it contacts `u` is `1 / degree(v) = 1/5`.\n        *   The probability of this entire event is `(1/10) * (1/5) = 1/50`.\n    *   Since these two cases are mutually exclusive (only one node is chosen to initiate gossip in a single step), the total probability is the sum of their individual probabilities.\n    *   Total Probability = P(Case 1) + P(Case 2) = `1/50 + 1/50 = 2/50 = 1/25`.\n\nThe probability can also be expressed as a decimal (0.04) or a percentage (4%). The fraction 1/25 is the most precise form.\n\nFinal check of the logic. The logic is sound and directly follows from the standard definitions of the components of the problem. The search results confirm these definitions. No other interpretation seems more plausible given the standard terminology.\n\nFinal answer is 1/25.\nThe probability of sampling the bottleneck edge in a randomized uniform gossiping protocol on a 10-node barbell graph is 1/25.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the calculation:\n\n1.  **Graph Structure**: A 10-node barbell graph consists of two 5-node complete graphs (K5 cliques), connected by a single edge, known as the bottleneck or bridge. Let's call the two cliques A and B, and the bottleneck edge connects node `u` in clique A to node `v` in clique B.\n\n2.  **Node Degrees**:\n    *   Within each K5 clique, a node is connected to 4 other nodes.\n    *   The node `u` is connected to 4 nodes in its own clique and to node `v` via the bottleneck. Therefore, the degree of `u` is `4 + 1 = 5`.\n    *   Similarly, the degree of node `v` is `5`.\n    *   All other 8 nodes (4 in each clique) are only connected within their respective cliques, so their degree is 4.\n\n3.  **Randomized Uniform Gossiping**: This process involves two steps at each iteration:\n    *   A node is selected uniformly at random from all 10 nodes in the network. The probability of picking any specific node is 1/10.\n    *   The selected node then chooses one of its neighbors to communicate with, uniformly at random. The probability of choosing a specific neighbor is `1 / degree(selected_node)`.\n\n4.  **Probability Calculation**: The bottleneck edge is sampled if communication happens between node `u` and node `v`. This can occur in two mutually exclusive ways:\n\n    *   **Scenario 1: Node `u` contacts node `v`**.\n        *   The probability of selecting node `u` is 1/10.\n        *   Given `u` is selected, the probability it contacts `v` is `1 / degree(u)` = 1/5.\n        *   The total probability for this scenario is `(1/10) * (1/5) = 1/50`.\n\n    *   **Scenario 2: Node `v` contacts node `u`**.\n        *   The probability of selecting node `v` is 1/10.\n        *   Given `v` is selected, the probability it contacts `u` is `1 / degree(v)` = 1/5.\n        *   The total probability for this scenario is `(1/10) * (1/5) = 1/50`.\n\nThe total probability of sampling the bottleneck edge is the sum of the probabilities of these two scenarios:\n\nTotal Probability = `1/50 + 1/50 = 2/50 = 1/25`.\n\n<<<1/25>>>"
