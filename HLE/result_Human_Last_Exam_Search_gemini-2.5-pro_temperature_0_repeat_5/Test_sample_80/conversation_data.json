    "A standard chessboard has 8 squares on each of its four sides. The four corner squares are counted in two sides each, so the total number of edge squares is (8 * 4) - 4 = 28.\n\nThe goal is to place the maximum number of bishops on these 28 edge squares so that no two bishops attack each other. A bishop attacks any other piece along a diagonal of the same color. This means that bishops on light-colored squares can only attack bishops on other light-colored squares, and bishops on dark-colored squares can only attack those on other dark-colored squares.\n\nThe maximum number of non-attacking bishops that can be placed on a standard 8x8 chessboard is 14. This is achieved by placing bishops on all the squares of the first rank (a1 to h1) and all the squares of the second rank (a2 to h2) is an incorrect statement, as they would attack each other. A correct placement for 14 non-attacking bishops is to place them all on the squares of a single color, for instance all 14 white squares on the edge of the board. However, this is not a valid arrangement as some of these bishops would attack each other. For example, the bishop on square b1 would attack a bishop on square a2.\n\nA valid arrangement for placing the maximum number of non-attacking bishops on the edge squares is to place 10 bishops on the light-colored squares and 4 on the dark-colored squares, or vice-versa, for a total of 14 bishops. One such configuration is to place bishops on all the squares of the first rank (8 bishops) and on all the squares of the last rank except for the two corner squares (6 bishops). This gives a total of 14 bishops. Let's verify that these bishops do not attack each other:\n*   Bishops on the same rank do not attack each other.\n*   A bishop on a1 attacks h8, but there is no bishop on h8.\n*   A bishop on h1 attacks a8, but there is no bishop on a8.\n*   No other bishop on the first rank can attack any bishop on the eighth rank.\n\nSince the maximum number of non-attacking bishops on a chessboard is 14, and we have found a configuration with 14 bishops all on edge squares, this is the maximum number of bishops that can be placed on the edge squares.\n\nThe number of edge squares that would lack bishops is the total number of edge squares minus the number of squares occupied by bishops:\n28 (total edge squares) - 14 (bishops placed) = 14.\n\nTherefore, 14 edge squares would lack bishops.\n\n<<<14>>>"
