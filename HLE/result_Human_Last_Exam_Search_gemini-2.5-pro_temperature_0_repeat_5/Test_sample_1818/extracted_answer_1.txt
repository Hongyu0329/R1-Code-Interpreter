The optimal Spreading Factor is **SF7**, as it provides the lowest Time on Air and therefore the lowest energy consumption for any given link budget it can satisfy. The optimal Transmission Power is the minimum level required to overcome the specific path loss for the device's location, ranging from **2 dBm to 14 dBm**, as determined by the ADR algorithm.
