    "There are exactly **five** finite groups that contain maximal by inclusion product-free sets of size 2.\n\nA subset *S* of a group *G* is called product-free if for any two elements *a* and *b* in *S* (including the case where *a* = *b*), their product *ab* is not in *S*. A product-free set is maximal by inclusion (or a locally maximal product-free set) if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set in *G*.\n\nThe classification of finite groups containing such sets of size 2 was established by Michael Giudici and Sarah Hart. Their findings show that a finite group *G* possesses a maximal by inclusion product-free set of size 2 if and only if *G* is isomorphic to one of the following five groups:\n\n*   **C₅**: The cyclic group of order 5.\n*   **C₆**: The cyclic group of order 6.\n*   **S₃**: The symmetric group of order 6 (also isomorphic to the dihedral group of order 6, D₆).\n*   **D₈**: The dihedral group of order 8.\n*   **Q₈**: The quaternion group of order 8.\n\nThe analysis in the research paper \"Small maximal sum-free sets\" considers different cases based on the structure of the set of size 2 and the subgroup it generates to arrive at this complete classification.\n\n<<<5>>>"
