    "The space-time, double Fourier transform of the generalized pair correlation function, commonly known as the Van Hove correlation function, is called the **dynamic structure factor**.\n\nThe generalized pair correlation function, often denoted as G(r, t), describes the probability of finding a particle at a position **r** at a time **t**, given that there was a particle at the origin at t=0. This function is fundamental in describing the structure and dynamics of many-particle systems.\n\nWhen a space-time double Fourier transform is applied to the Van Hove correlation function, it yields the dynamic structure factor, S(Q, Ï‰). The dynamic structure factor is a crucial quantity in the analysis of scattering experiments, such as inelastic neutron scattering, as it contains information about the energy and momentum transfers in the scattering process. The relationship between the Van Hove function and the dynamic structure factor allows experimentalists to probe the microscopic dynamics of a system.\n\nIn the context of nuclear systems, the dynamic structure factor provides insights into the collective excitations and correlations of nucleons.\n\n<<<dynamic structure factor>>>"
