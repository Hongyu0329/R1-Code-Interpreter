    "For a five-channel flow cytometry sorting experiment using the detection channels AF350, GFP, PE, AF647, and AF750, and involving a streptavidin-based detection system, you should prepare a minimum of 12 essential control samples.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the necessary controls:\n\n**1. Basic Controls (1 tube):**\n*   **Unstained Cells:** This is the most fundamental control. It consists of cells that have gone through all the processing steps but without the addition of any fluorescent reagents. This control is essential to assess the baseline autofluorescence of your cells and to set the initial forward and side scatter gates to identify your cell population of interest.\n\n**2. Compensation Controls (5 tubes):**\nFor any multicolor flow cytometry experiment, you must correct for the spectral overlap between different fluorochromes. This process, called compensation, requires single-stain controls for every fluorochrome in your panel.\n*   **AF350 Single Stain (1 tube):** Cells stained only with the AF350-conjugated reagent. If this is a viability dye, this control sets the gate for live versus dead cells.\n*   **GFP Single Stain (1 tube):** This will be your GFP-positive cells (if it's a reporter) or cells stained only with a GFP-conjugated antibody.\n*   **PE Single Stain (1 tube):** Since you are using a streptavidin system, this control will likely consist of cells (or compensation beads) stained with your biotinylated antibody followed by Streptavidin-PE.\n*   **AF647 Single Stain (1 tube):** Cells stained only with the AF647-conjugated antibody.\n*   **AF750 Single Stain (1 tube):** Cells stained only with the AF750-conjugated antibody.\n\n**3. Gating Controls (5 tubes):**\n*   **Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls:** FMO controls are critical for accurately setting the gates to distinguish between positive and negative populations, especially when signals are dim or expression is continuous. An FMO control includes all the stains in your panel except for one. For a new five-color panel, it is highly recommended to prepare an FMO for each channel.\n    *   **FMO-AF350 (1 tube):** Cells stained with GFP, PE, AF647, and AF750 (but not AF350).\n    *   **FMO-GFP (1 tube):** Cells stained with AF350, PE, AF647, and AF750 (but not GFP).\n    *   **FMO-PE (1 tube):** Cells stained with AF350, GFP, AF647, and AF750 (but not the PE-streptavidin).\n    *   **FMO-AF647 (1 tube):** Cells stained with AF350, GFP, PE, and AF750 (but not AF647).\n    *   **FMO-AF750 (1 tube):** Cells stained with AF350, GFP, PE, and AF647 (but not AF750).\n\n**4. Streptavidin System Specificity Control (1 tube):**\n*   **Streptavidin-PE Only Control:** This sample consists of cells incubated only with the Streptavidin-PE conjugate (without any biotinylated antibody). This is essential to determine if the streptavidin conjugate itself is binding non-specifically to your cells, which can be a source of background signal.\n\nIn addition to these 12 control tubes, you will also have your fully stained experimental sample. It is also good practice to include biological controls, such as cells known to be positive or negative for your markers, to confirm antibody specificity.\n\n<<<12>>>"
