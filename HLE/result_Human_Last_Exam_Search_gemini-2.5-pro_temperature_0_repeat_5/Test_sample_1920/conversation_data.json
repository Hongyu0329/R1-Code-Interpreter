    "To find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters $\\chi$ of conductor $d=53599$ and order 6, we follow these steps:\n\n### 1. Prime Factorization of the Conductor\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of the conductor $d = 53599$.\n$d = 53599 = 7 \\times 13 \\times 19 \\times 31$.\nLet the prime factors be $p_1=7$, $p_2=13$, $p_3=19$, and $p_4=31$.\n\n### 2. Structure of Primitive Characters\nA Dirichlet character $\\chi$ with a square-free conductor $d = p_1 p_2 \\cdots p_r$ is primitive if and only if it can be written as a product of non-principal primitive characters $\\chi_i$ with conductor $p_i$.\nSo, $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\chi_3 \\chi_4$, where each $\\chi_i$ is a non-principal character modulo $p_i$. A character modulo a prime $p$ is primitive if its conductor is $p$, which is true for any non-principal character. The principal character has a conductor of 1.\n\n### 3. Order of the Character\nThe order of the character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters $\\chi_i$. Let $k_i = \\text{ord}(\\chi_i)$. We require:\n$\\text{lcm}(k_1, k_2, k_3, k_4) = 6$.\n\nThe order $k_i$ of a character $\\chi_i$ modulo $p_i$ must divide $\\phi(p_i) = p_i - 1$, where $\\phi$ is Euler's totient function. Also, since each $\\chi_i$ must be non-principal, its order $k_i$ must be greater than 1.\n\nLet's check the values of $p_i - 1$:\n*   $p_1 - 1 = 7 - 1 = 6$\n*   $p_2 - 1 = 13 - 1 = 12$\n*   $p_3 - 1 = 19 - 1 = 18$\n*   $p_4 - 1 = 31 - 1 = 30$\n\nThe condition $\\text{lcm}(k_1, k_2, k_3, k_4) = 6$ implies that the prime factors of each $k_i$ can only be 2 and 3, and the highest power of these primes dividing any $k_i$ must be $2^1$ and $3^1$. This means each $k_i$ must be a divisor of 6. Since $k_i > 1$, the possible orders for each component character are $k_i \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$.\n\nAll these orders are valid for each prime factor, as 6 divides $p_i-1$ for all $i=1,2,3,4$.\n\n### 4. Counting the Characters\nThe number of primitive characters of order $k$ modulo a prime $p$ (where $k | p-1$) is given by $\\phi(k)$.\n*   Number of characters of order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$.\n*   Number of characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n*   Number of characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$.\n\nFor each prime factor $p_i$, there are $\\phi(2) + \\phi(3) + \\phi(6) = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5$ possible choices for the character $\\chi_i$ to have an order in $\\{2, 3, 6\\}$. Since there are four prime factors, the total number of combinations of such characters is $5^4 = 625$.\n\nHowever, we must only count the combinations where the least common multiple of the orders is exactly 6. This means:\n1.  At least one of the orders $k_i$ must be divisible by 2.\n2.  At least one of the orders $k_j$ must be divisible by 3.\n\nWe use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. We subtract the cases where the lcm is not 6 from the total of 625. The lcm is not 6 if:\n*   **Case A: The lcm is not divisible by 3.** This occurs if all $k_i$ are chosen from the set of orders not divisible by 3, which is just $\\{2\\}$. In this case, all four characters $\\chi_i$ must have order 2. The number of such combinations is $(\\phi(2))^4 = 1^4 = 1$. The resulting lcm is 2.\n*   **Case B: The lcm is not divisible by 2.** This occurs if all $k_i$ are chosen from the set of orders not divisible by 2, which is just $\\{3\\}$. In this case, all four characters $\\chi_i$ must have order 3. The number of such combinations is $(\\phi(3))^4 = 2^4 = 16$. The resulting lcm is 3.\n\nThe two cases are mutually exclusive. Therefore, the number of combinations where the lcm is not 6 is $1 + 16 = 17$.\n\nThe final number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor 53599 and order 6 is the total number of possibilities minus the excluded cases:\n$625 - 17 = 608$.\n\n<<<608>>>"
