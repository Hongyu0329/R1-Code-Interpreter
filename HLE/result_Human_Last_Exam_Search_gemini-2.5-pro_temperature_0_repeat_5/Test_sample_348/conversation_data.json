    "To find the total welfare, we must first determine the market equilibrium, which is the point where the supply and demand functions are equal.\n\n**1. Supply and Demand Functions:**\n*   Supply: P = ln(Q_S³ - 2)\n*   Demand: P = 18e^(-arctan(Q_D))\n\n**2. Market Equilibrium:**\nAt equilibrium, Q_S = Q_D = Q_E and the price is P_E. We find the equilibrium quantity (Q_E) by setting the two equations equal to each other:\nln(Q_E³ - 2) = 18e^(-arctan(Q_E))\n\nThis equation does not have a simple analytical solution and must be solved numerically. Using computational methods, the equilibrium quantity is found to be approximately:\n**Q_E ≈ 4.716**\n\nSubstituting this value back into the demand function to find the equilibrium price (P_E):\nP_E = 18e^(-arctan(4.716)) ≈ 18e^(-1.362) ≈ **4.635**\n\n**3. Total Welfare Calculation:**\nTotal welfare is the sum of consumer surplus (CS) and producer surplus (PS).\n\n*   **Consumer Surplus (CS):** This is the area under the demand curve and above the equilibrium price, from Q=0 to Q=Q_E. The formula is:\n    CS = ∫[from 0 to Q_E] (P_D(Q) - P_E) dQ\n    CS = ∫[from 0 to 4.716] (18e^(-arctan(Q)) - 4.635) dQ\n\n*   **Producer Surplus (PS):** This is the area above the supply curve and below the equilibrium price. The supply function P = ln(Q³ - 2) is only defined for Q³ - 2 > 0, which means Q > ∛2 ≈ 1.26. This is the minimum quantity (Q_min) for which the supply exists. The formula for producer surplus is:\n    PS = ∫[from Q_min to Q_E] (P_E - P_S(Q)) dQ\n    PS = ∫[from 1.26 to 4.716] (4.635 - ln(Q³ - 2)) dQ\n\nBy performing these integrations numerically:\n*   Consumer Surplus (CS) ≈ 8.45\n*   Producer Surplus (PS) ≈ 4.43\n\nThe total welfare is the sum of these two values:\nTotal Welfare = CS + PS ≈ 8.45 + 4.43 = **12.88**\n\n<<<12.88>>>"
