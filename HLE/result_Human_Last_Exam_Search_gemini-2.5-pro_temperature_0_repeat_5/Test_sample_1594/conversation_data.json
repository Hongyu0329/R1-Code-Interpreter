    "When viewed from above, the buildings of the Istituto Galilei-Pacinotti and the Istituto Ulisse Dini in Pisa form the letter 'H'.\n\nThe two high schools are located next to each other on Via Benedetto Croce. The Istituto Galilei-Pacinotti is composed of two adjacent buildings, the Liceo Classico \"Galileo Galilei\" at Via Benedetto Croce, 32, and the Istituto Tecnico Economico \"Antonio Pacinotti\". Next to them is the Liceo Scientifico \"Ulisse Dini\" at number 36 of the same street. The schools share an internal courtyard. An aerial view of the complex reveals that the two main buildings run parallel to each other and are connected by a smaller central structure, thus creating the distinct shape of the letter 'H'.\n\n<<<H>>>"
