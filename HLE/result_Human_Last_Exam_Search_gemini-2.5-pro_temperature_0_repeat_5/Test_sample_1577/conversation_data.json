    "The ground space degeneracy (GSD) of the toric code is determined by the number of logical qubits (`k`) it can encode, with the relationship being GSD = 2^k. The number of logical qubits is, in turn, determined by the topology of the surface on which the code is defined.\n\n1.  **Toric Code on a Closed Surface**: For a closed surface without boundaries, such as a torus, the number of logical qubits is `k = 2g`, where `g` is the genus of the surface (the number of \"handles\"). A standard torus has `g=1`, so it encodes `k=2` logical qubits, resulting in a ground space degeneracy of 2^2 = 4.\n\n2.  **Toric Code on a Surface with Boundaries (Holes)**: When the toric code is implemented on a surface with boundaries, such as a plane with holes (punctures), it is often referred to as a planar code. These holes act as boundaries, and their properties affect the number of logical qubits.\n\n3.  **Smooth and Rough Boundaries**: There are two primary types of boundaries for the toric code:\n    *   **Smooth Boundary**: Created by measuring a set of Pauli-X stabilizers. At a smooth boundary, electric excitations (`e`-anyons) can be absorbed or created.\n    *   **Rough Boundary**: Created by measuring a set of Pauli-Z stabilizers. At a rough boundary, magnetic excitations (`m`-anyons) can be absorbed or created.\n\n4.  **Calculating Logical Qubits with Holes**: For a toric code on a plane (which is topologically a sphere with one large boundary), introducing additional holes increases the number of logical qubits. It is a known result that for a planar code with `b` holes of a single type (either all smooth or all rough), the number of encoded logical qubits is `k = b`. This means each hole effectively contributes one logical qubit to the system.\n\n5.  **Combining Smooth and Rough Holes**: When we have `n` smooth holes and `m` rough holes, the logical operators associated with the smooth holes are of a different type (e.g., logical `Z` strings terminate on smooth holes) than those associated with the rough holes (e.g., logical `X` strings terminate on rough holes). These two sets of logical operators commute with each other, meaning the qubits encoded by the smooth holes are independent of the qubits encoded by the rough holes.\n\n    *   The `n` smooth holes contribute `n` logical qubits.\n    *   The `m` rough holes contribute `m` logical qubits.\n\n    Therefore, the total number of logical qubits is the sum of the contributions from each type of hole:\n    `k = n + m`\n\n6.  **Final Degeneracy**: With `k = n + m` logical qubits, the ground space degeneracy is:\n    GSD = 2^k = 2^(n+m)\n\nThis corresponds to answer choice A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
