    "During World War II, the largest French ship by displacement to be sunk by a U-boat before the armistice of June 22, 1940, was the passenger liner **SS *Brazza***.\n\nThe *Brazza*, with a gross register tonnage of 10,387 tons, was torpedoed and sunk by the German submarine U-37 on May 28, 1940. At the time of its sinking, the *Brazza* was in service as an auxiliary cruiser.\n\nSeveral other French vessels were also sunk by U-boats during this period. The German submarine U-9 was responsible for the sinking of the submarine *Doris* (615 tons surfaced displacement) on May 9, 1940, as well as the merchant ships *Vulcain* (4,362 GRT) and *Tringa* (1,930 GRT) in the same month. U-37 also sank the smaller French ships *Julien* (116 GRT) and *Marie Jos√©* (2,477 GRT) in May 1940.\n\nOther notable French naval losses during the Battle of France, such as the destroyer *Jaguar* and the torpedo boat *Orage*, were not caused by U-boats. The *Jaguar* was sunk by a German E-boat (motor torpedo boat), and the *Orage* was sunk by German aircraft.\n\nTherefore, with a displacement significantly larger than any other French vessel sunk by a U-boat in the specified timeframe, the SS *Brazza* holds this distinction.\n\n<<<SS Brazza>>>"
