    "To find the separatrix of the system of differential equations, we first need to analyze its phase plane portrait, which includes finding the equilibrium points and determining their stability.\n\nThe given system is:\n1.  $d'(t) = 2d^2(t) + (-3u(t) + 5u^2(t))d(t) - u(t)(1-u(t))u^2(t)$\n2.  $u'(t) = (u(t)-1)u^2(t)$\n\nWe are considering the phase plane for $u \\geq 0$.\n\n**Step 1: Find the equilibrium points**\nEquilibrium points (or critical points) are found by setting the derivatives to zero: $d'(t) = 0$ and $u'(t) = 0$.\n\nFrom $u'(t) = (u-1)u^2 = 0$, we find the u-coordinates of the equilibrium points to be $u=0$ or $u=1$.\n\nNow, we substitute these values into the equation for $d'(t) = 0$:\n*   **Case 1: u = 0**\n    $2d^2 + (-3(0) + 5(0)^2)d - 0(1-0)(0)^2 = 0$\n    $2d^2 = 0 \\implies d = 0$\n    This gives the equilibrium point $(0, 0)$.\n\n*   **Case 2: u = 1**\n    $2d^2 + (-3(1) + 5(1)^2)d - 1(1-1)(1)^2 = 0$\n    $2d^2 + 2d = 0$\n    $2d(d+1) = 0 \\implies d = 0$ or $d = -1$\n    This gives the equilibrium points $(1, 0)$ and $(1, -1)$.\n\nSo, the system has three equilibrium points in the region $u \\geq 0$: $(0, 0)$, $(1, 0)$, and $(1, -1)$.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the stability of the equilibrium points**\nWe compute the Jacobian matrix $J(u, d)$ of the system:\n$J(u, d) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial u} & \\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial d} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial d'}{\\partial u} & \\frac{\\partial d'}{\\partial d} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 3u^2 - 2u & 0 \\\\ (-3 + 10u)d - 3u^2 + 4u^3 & 4d - 3u + 5u^2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nNow we evaluate the Jacobian at each equilibrium point:\n*   **At (1, 0):**\n    $J(1, 0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 3(1)^2 - 2(1) & 0 \\\\ (-3 + 10)(0) - 3(1)^2 + 4(1)^3 & 4(0) - 3(1) + 5(1)^2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    The eigenvalues are the diagonal entries, $\\lambda_1 = 1$ and $\\lambda_2 = 2$. Since both are positive, $(1, 0)$ is an **unstable node**.\n\n*   **At (1, -1):**\n    $J(1, -1) = \\begin{pmatrix} 3(1)^2 - 2(1) & 0 \\\\ (-3 + 10)(-1) - 3(1)^2 + 4(1)^3 & 4(-1) - 3(1) + 5(1)^2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ -6 & -2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1 = 1$ and $\\lambda_2 = -2$. Since the eigenvalues have opposite signs, $(1, -1)$ is a **saddle point**.\n\n*   **At (0, 0):**\n    $J(0, 0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    The linearization is inconclusive, so this is a degenerate critical point.\n\n**Step 3: Find the separatrix**\nA separatrix is a trajectory that separates regions of different long-term behavior. Separatrices are typically the stable and unstable manifolds of saddle points. We have a saddle point at $(1, -1)$.\n\nLet's find the manifolds of this saddle point. The eigenvectors of $J(1, -1)$ give the directions of the manifolds.\n*   For the unstable manifold (eigenvalue $\\lambda_1 = 1$):\n    $(J - I)v = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ -6 & -3 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\implies -6x - 3y = 0 \\implies y = -2x$.\n    The eigenvector is proportional to $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -2 \\end{pmatrix}$. The unstable manifold leaves the saddle point with a slope of $-2$.\n\n*   For the stable manifold (eigenvalue $\\lambda_2 = -2$):\n    $(J + 2I)v = \\begin{pmatrix} 3 & 0 \\\\ -6 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\implies 3x = 0 \\implies x = 0$.\n    The eigenvector is proportional to $\\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$. The stable manifold approaches the saddle point along the vertical direction, i.e., along the line $u=1$.\n\nThe stable manifold is the line $u=1$ (excluding the point (1,0)). This line separates the phase plane into two regions: one where $u(t) \\to 0$ (for $u<1$) and one where $u(t) \\to \\infty$ (for $u>1$).\n\nThe unstable manifold is a trajectory that leaves the saddle point. Let's test for a simple solution of the form $d = f(u)$. The equation for the trajectories is:\n$\\frac{dd}{du} = \\frac{d'(t)}{u'(t)} = \\frac{2d^2 + (-3u + 5u^2)d - u^3(1-u)}{u^2(u-1)}$\n\nLet's test the specific curve $d = -u^2$.\nIf $d = -u^2$, then $\\frac{dd}{du} = -2u$.\nSubstituting $d = -u^2$ into the right-hand side of the trajectory equation:\n$\\frac{2(-u^2)^2 + (-3u + 5u^2)(-u^2) - u^3(1-u)}{u^2(u-1)} = \\frac{2u^4 + 3u^3 - 5u^4 - u^3 + u^4}{u^2(u-1)} = \\frac{-2u^4 + 2u^3}{u^2(u-1)} = \\frac{-2u^3(u-1)}{u^2(u-1)} = -2u$.\nSince the left-hand side equals the right-hand side, the curve $d = -u^2$ is an exact trajectory of the system.\n\nLet's check if this trajectory corresponds to the unstable manifold of the saddle point $(1, -1)$.\n*   At $u=1$, $d = -(1)^2 = -1$. The curve passes through the saddle point.\n*   The slope of the curve at $u=1$ is $\\frac{dd}{du} = -2(1) = -2$. This matches the slope of the unstable manifold we calculated from the eigenvector.\n*   The curve also passes through the equilibrium point $(0,0)$.\n\nThus, the curve $d = -u^2$ is the unstable manifold of the saddle point $(1, -1)$. It is a heteroclinic orbit connecting the saddle point $(1, -1)$ to the degenerate equilibrium point $(0, 0)$.\n\nSuch a special trajectory, which is the unstable manifold of a saddle point and connects two equilibria, is a key separatrix of the system. It governs the boundaries of basins of attraction. In this system, it can be shown that this curve acts as an attractor for all trajectories in the strip $0 < u < 1$, and it separates different asymptotic behaviors in the region $u > 1$.\n\nGiven the options of the stable manifold ($u=1$) and the unstable manifold ($d=-u^2$), the unstable manifold represents a more specific and detailed feature of the system's dynamics and is often what is referred to when \"the separatrix\" is requested in such a problem.\n\nThe separatrix is the curve given by the equation $d = -u^2$.\n\n<<<The separatrix is the curve defined by the equation $d = -u^2$.>>>"
