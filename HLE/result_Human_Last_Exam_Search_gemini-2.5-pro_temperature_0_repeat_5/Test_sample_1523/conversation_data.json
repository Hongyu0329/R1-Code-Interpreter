    "In finite-temperature field theory, the partition function `Z` for a neutral scalar field `ϕ` is expressed through the functional integral formalism. This representation is a cornerstone for studying the statistical mechanics of quantum fields. The partition function is given by:\n\n`Z = ∫ Dϕ exp(-S_E[ϕ])`\n\nHere, `∫ Dϕ` denotes the functional integral over all possible field configurations that are periodic in imaginary time `τ` with a period `β = 1/T`, where `T` is the temperature. `S_E[ϕ]` is the Euclidean action for the scalar field.\n\nThe Euclidean action for a free, neutral scalar field with mass `m` is:\n\n`S_E[ϕ] = ∫_0^β dτ ∫ d³x [ (1/2)(∂_τ ϕ)² + (1/2)(∇ϕ)² + (1/2)m²ϕ² ]`\n\nTo identify the inner product `(ϕ, D_ϕ)`, we can rewrite the action by performing an integration by parts on the kinetic terms. Assuming the field `ϕ` vanishes at spatial infinity, the spatial derivative term becomes:\n\n`∫ d³x (∇ϕ)² = -∫ d³x ϕ(∇²ϕ)`\n\nFor the temporal derivative term, the periodicity of the field in imaginary time, `ϕ(0, x) = ϕ(β, x)`, ensures that the boundary terms from integration by parts cancel out:\n\n`∫_0^β dτ (∂_τ ϕ)² = -∫_0^β dτ ϕ(∂_τ²ϕ)`\n\nSubstituting these back into the action, we get:\n\n`S_E[ϕ] = (1/2) ∫_0^β dτ ∫ d³x ϕ(-∂_τ² - ∇² + m²)ϕ`\n\nThis expression is of the form `(1/2)(ϕ, D_ϕ)`. The inner product `(f, g)` for two fields `f` and `g` in this context is defined as the integral over the Euclidean spacetime volume:\n\n`(f, g) = ∫_0^β dτ ∫ d³x f(τ, x)g(τ, x)`\n\nFrom this, we can identify the operator `D_ϕ` as the Euclidean Klein-Gordon operator:\n\n`D_ϕ = -∂_τ² - ∇² + m²`\n\nTherefore, the inner product `(ϕ, D_ϕ)` is the integral of the field `ϕ` multiplied by the action of the Euclidean Klein-Gordon operator on `ϕ` over the Euclidean spacetime volume. This quadratic form in the exponent of the functional integral is fundamental for calculations in finite-temperature field theory, such as determining the propagator and thermodynamic quantities.\n\n<<<In finite-temperature field theory, for a neutral scalar field `ϕ`, the inner product `(ϕ, D_ϕ)` in the functional integral representation of the partition function is given by the Euclidean action for the free field. Specifically, it is:\n\n`(ϕ, D_ϕ) = ∫_0^β dτ ∫ d³x ϕ(τ, x) [-∂_τ² - ∇² + m²] ϕ(τ, x)`\n\nwhere:\n*   `τ` is the imaginary time, integrated from `0` to `β = 1/T`, with `T` being the temperature.\n*   `x` represents the spatial coordinates.\n*   `m` is the mass of the scalar field.\n*   The operator `D_ϕ = -∂_τ² - ∇² + m²` is the Euclidean Klein-Gordon operator.\n\nThe inner product itself is defined as `(f, g) = ∫_0^β dτ ∫ d³x f(τ, x)g(τ, x)`. The partition function `Z` for the free field is then proportional to the inverse square root of the determinant of the operator `D_ϕ`.>>>"
