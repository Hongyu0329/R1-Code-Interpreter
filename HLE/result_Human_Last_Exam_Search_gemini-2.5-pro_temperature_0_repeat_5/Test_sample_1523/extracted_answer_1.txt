In finite-temperature field theory, for a neutral scalar field `ϕ`, the inner product `(ϕ, D_ϕ)` in the functional integral representation of the partition function is given by the Euclidean action for the free field. Specifically, it is:

`(ϕ, D_ϕ) = ∫_0^β dτ ∫ d³x ϕ(τ, x) [-∂_τ² - ∇² + m²] ϕ(τ, x)`

where:
*   `τ` is the imaginary time, integrated from `0` to `β = 1/T`, with `T` being the temperature.
*   `x` represents the spatial coordinates.
*   `m` is the mass of the scalar field.
*   The operator `D_ϕ = -∂_τ² - ∇² + m²` is the Euclidean Klein-Gordon operator.

The inner product itself is defined as `(f, g) = ∫_0^β dτ ∫ d³x f(τ, x)g(τ, x)`. The partition function `Z` for the free field is then proportional to the inverse square root of the determinant of the operator `D_ϕ`.
