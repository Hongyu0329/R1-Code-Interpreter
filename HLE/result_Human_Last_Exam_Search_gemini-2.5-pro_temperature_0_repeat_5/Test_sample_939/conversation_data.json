    "The ROMM RGB color space, also known as ProPhoto RGB, has a significantly wider gamut than the sRGB color space. This means that ROMM RGB can represent more saturated colors, particularly in the green and blue regions, than sRGB can display or encode. When a color from the larger ROMM RGB gamut is converted to the smaller sRGB gamut, colors that lie outside the sRGB boundaries are considered \"out-of-gamut\" and cannot be accurately represented.\n\nThe boundaries of a color space are defined by its primary colors (the purest red, green, and blue). A comparison of the chromaticity coordinates of the primaries for both spaces shows that the ROMM RGB primaries are more saturated than the sRGB primaries.\n\n*   **ROMM RGB Green Primary**: The pure green in ROMM RGB, represented as `RGB(0, 1, 0)`, lies far outside the triangle formed by the sRGB primaries. Therefore, it cannot be represented in sRGB.\n*   **ROMM RGB Blue Primary**: The pure blue in ROMM RGB, `RGB(0, 0, 1)`, is also more saturated than the sRGB blue primary and falls outside the sRGB gamut.\n*   **Achromatic and Less Saturated Colors**: The color `RGB(1, 1, 1)` represents white, which is a color present in both gamuts. The colors `RGB(0, 0.5, 0.6)` and `RGB(0.4, 0.5, 0.6)` are less saturated as they are mixtures of primaries. These colors fall within the interior of the ROMM RGB gamut and are located inside the smaller sRGB gamut, making them representable.\n\nTherefore, the highly saturated primary colors `RGB(0, 0, 1)` and `RGB(0, 1, 0)` from the ROMM RGB space cannot be represented by an sRGB hex code.\n\n<<<1, 2>>>"
