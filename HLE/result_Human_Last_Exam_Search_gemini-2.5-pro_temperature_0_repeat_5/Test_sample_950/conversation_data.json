    "The user is asking for the rank of the torsion subgroup of the integral cohomology ring of the space of 3-subspaces of $\\mathbb{R}^5$.\n\nFirst, let's identify the space in question. The space of 3-subspaces of $\\mathbb{R}^5$ is the real Grassmannian manifold, denoted as $G(3, 5)$ or $Gr(3, \\mathbb{R}^5)$.\n\nThe integral cohomology ring is $H^*(G(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z})$. The torsion subgroup of an abelian group consists of all elements of finite order. The torsion subgroup of the entire cohomology ring is the direct sum of the torsion subgroups of each cohomology group $H^k(G(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\nThe rank of an abelian group is the rank of its free part. A torsion group, being a group where every element has finite order, has a rank of 0. Therefore, the rank of the torsion subgroup is, by definition, 0.\n\nIt is possible the user is asking for a different property, such as the structure or order of the torsion subgroup. Let's investigate the structure of $H^*(G(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\nThe integral cohomology of real Grassmannians is known to have only 2-torsion. The space $G(k, n)$ is homeomorphic to $G(n-k, n)$. In our case, $G(3, 5)$ is homeomorphic to $G(2, 5)$. The integral cohomology groups of $G(2, 5)$ have been computed. A MathOverflow answer references a paper by Casian and Kodama which computes the cohomology groups for $G(2, \\mathbb{R}^5)$.\n\nThe integral cohomology groups of $G(2, 5)$ are given as:\n*   $H^0(G(2,5); \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}$\n*   $H^1(G(2,5); \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$\n*   $H^2(G(2,5); \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}_2$\n*   $H^3(G(2,5); \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}_2$\n*   $H^4(G(2,5); \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2$\n*   $H^5(G(2,5); \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}_2$\n*   $H^6(G(2,5); \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$\n\nThe dimension of the manifold $G(3, 5)$ is $k(n-k) = 3(5-3) = 6$. The manifold $G(k,n)$ is orientable if and only if $n$ is even, or if $n$ is odd and $\\binom{n-1}{k-1}$ is even. For $G(3,5)$, $n=5$ is odd, and we check $\\binom{5-1}{3-1} = \\binom{4}{2} = 6$, which is even. Therefore, $G(3,5)$ is orientable. This contradicts the result from the MathOverflow source which states $H^6(G(2,5);\\mathbb{Z}) = 0$ and implies non-orientability. Let's re-verify the orientability. Another source states that $G_k(\\mathbb{R}^n)$ is orientable if and only if $n$ is even. Let's assume the first, more detailed criterion is correct.\n\nLet's look at another source for the cohomology groups. A paper by He provides the PoincarÃ© polynomial for the torsion part of the homology of $G_k(\\mathbb{R}^n)$. The torsion part of the cohomology is isomorphic to the torsion part of the homology of one degree lower.\nFor $G(3,5)$, the Betti numbers and torsion coefficients are needed.\n\nLet's assume the computation from the MathOverflow source is accurate for $G(2,5) \\cong G(3,5)$. The torsion subgroup of the integral cohomology ring is the direct sum of the torsion parts of each group:\n$T = H^2_{tors} \\oplus H^3_{tors} \\oplus H^4_{tors} \\oplus H^5_{tors} = \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n\nThe question asks for the \"rank\" of this torsion subgroup. As an abelian group, the rank of $T$ is the dimension of the vector space $T \\otimes_{\\mathbb{Z}} \\mathbb{Q}$. Since every element in $T$ is a torsion element, for any $t \\in T$, there is an integer $n>1$ such that $nt=0$. In the tensor product, $t \\otimes q = t \\otimes (n \\frac{q}{n}) = (nt) \\otimes \\frac{q}{n} = 0 \\otimes \\frac{q}{n} = 0$. Thus, $T \\otimes_{\\mathbb{Z}} \\mathbb{Q} = 0$, and the rank is 0.\n\nIf the question is interpreted as the number of cyclic components in the torsion subgroup, the answer would be 4. If it is interpreted as the size (order) of the torsion subgroup, the answer would be $2^4 = 16$. However, the mathematical definition of the rank of a torsion group is strictly 0.\n\nGiven the precise language of the question, the only mathematically correct answer is 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
