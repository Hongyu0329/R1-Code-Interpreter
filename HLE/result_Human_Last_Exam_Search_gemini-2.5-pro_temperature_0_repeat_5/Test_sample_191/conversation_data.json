    "When the protein **CD47** is broken down or its interaction with another protein is blocked, it allows for the engulfment of amyloid by macrophages.\n\nCD47 is a protein found on the surface of many cells in the body. It interacts with a receptor on macrophages called SIRPα (Signal-Regulatory Protein Alpha). This interaction sends a \"don't eat me\" signal to the macrophages, which prevents them from engulfing the cell.\n\nBy breaking down CD47 or blocking the CD47-SIRPα interaction, for example with antibodies against CD47, this inhibitory signal is removed. The absence of the \"don't eat me\" signal allows macrophages to recognize and engulf particles like amyloid-beta, which are protein aggregates associated with diseases like Alzheimer's. This process is a key area of research for developing new therapies for amyloid-related diseases.\n\nIn addition to the CD47-SIRPα pathway, other proteins are also involved in the complex process of amyloid clearance by macrophages. For instance, the protein SHARPIN has been shown to regulate both the phagocytosis of amyloid-beta and the subsequent inflammatory response. Macrophages utilize a variety of surface receptors to recognize and bind to amyloid fibrils for engulfment, including CD36, Toll-like receptors (TLRs), and integrins. The efficiency of this engulfment and subsequent degradation of amyloid can be influenced by various factors and signaling pathways within the macrophage.\n\n<<<CD47>>>"
