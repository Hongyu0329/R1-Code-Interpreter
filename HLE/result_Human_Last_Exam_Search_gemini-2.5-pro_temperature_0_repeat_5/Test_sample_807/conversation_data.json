    "The Crayola crayon color that contains 9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride is **Shocking Pink**.\n\nThe chemical compound 9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride is more commonly known as Rhodamine B. Rhodamine B is a synthetic dye with a vibrant, fluorescent pinkish-red color. It is also identified by the Colour Index number C.I. 45170.\n\nCrayola introduced a line of fluorescent crayons in 1972, which included the color \"Ultra Pink\". This color was renamed \"Shocking Pink\" in 1990. Given that Rhodamine B is a well-known and widely used fluorescent pink dye, it is the pigment responsible for the bright, fluorescent quality of the \"Shocking Pink\" crayon. Crayola itself produces a range of fluorescent products, including paints and markers, that feature the \"Shocking Pink\" color.\n\n<<<Shocking Pink>>>"
