    "The value computed between heartbeats, derived from the beat-to-beat intervals captured by PPG, is most commonly called the **Interbeat Interval (IBI)**.\n\nWhile several terms are used, IBI is a general term that applies to measurements from both PPG and ECG. When using PPG, this interval is also sometimes referred to as the Pulse-to-Pulse Interval (PPI) or Beat-to-Beat Interval (BBI).\n\nThis is distinct from the \"R-R interval,\" which specifically refers to the time between the R-peaks on an ECG waveform. However, for practical purposes in HRV analysis, these terms are often used interchangeably to describe the time duration between consecutive heartbeats. The analysis of the variation in these successive IBIs is what constitutes Heart Rate Variability (HRV).\n\n<<<Interbeat Interval (IBI)>>>"
