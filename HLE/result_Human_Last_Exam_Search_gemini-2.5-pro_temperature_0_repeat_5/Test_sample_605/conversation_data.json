    "To determine the Crawley-Nordström invariant for the specified Calabi-Yau link, a careful analysis of the provided polynomial and weights is necessary.\n\nThe Calabi-Yau link is defined by the polynomial equation:\n$0=z_1^8z_3+z_1^4z_2^3z_3+z_1z_2^7+z_1z_2z_3z_4z_5+z_2z_3^4+z_4^3z_5+z_5^3$\n\nAnd the ambient space is defined by the weights:\n$w = (w_1, w_2, w_3, w_4, w_5) = (22, 29, 49, 50, 75)$\n\nFor a variety in a weighted projective space to be well-defined, the defining polynomial must be weighted-homogeneous. This means each monomial term must have the same weighted degree. Let's calculate the degree `d` for each monomial:\n*   $z_1^8z_3 \\implies d = 8 \\cdot 22 + 1 \\cdot 49 = 176 + 49 = 225$\n*   $z_1^4z_2^3z_3 \\implies d = 4 \\cdot 22 + 3 \\cdot 29 + 1 \\cdot 49 = 88 + 87 + 49 = 224$\n*   $z_1z_2^7 \\implies d = 1 \\cdot 22 + 7 \\cdot 29 = 22 + 203 = 225$\n*   $z_1z_2z_3z_4z_5 \\implies d = 22 + 29 + 49 + 50 + 75 = 225$\n*   $z_2z_3^4 \\implies d = 1 \\cdot 29 + 4 \\cdot 49 = 29 + 196 = 225$\n*   $z_4^3z_5 \\implies d = 3 \\cdot 50 + 1 \\cdot 75 = 150 + 75 = 225$\n*   $z_5^3 \\implies d = 3 \\cdot 75 = 225$\n\nThere is a discrepancy: the second monomial has a weighted degree of 224, while all others have a degree of 225. This suggests a typographical error in the problem statement, as the polynomial is not weighted-homogeneous as given.\n\nHowever, the Calabi-Yau condition for such a hypersurface is that the sum of the weights equals the degree of the polynomial (`Σ w_i = d`). Let's check the sum of the weights:\n`Σ w_i = 22 + 29 + 49 + 50 + 75 = 225`\n\nThis sum matches the degree of the majority of the monomials. It is therefore reasonable to assume that the intended degree of the polynomial is `d = 225` and that the second monomial is erroneous. The calculation of the Crawley-Nordström invariant for the link of a weighted homogeneous polynomial singularity depends only on the weights and the degree, not the specific coefficients of the polynomial.\n\nFor a Calabi-Yau link where `Σ w_i = d`, the formula for the Crawley-Nordström invariant `cn(L)` simplifies to:\n`cn(L) = (Σ w_i² - d) / (24d)`\n\nWe can now proceed with the calculation:\n1.  **Degree `d`**: `d = 225`\n2.  **Sum of the squares of the weights `Σ w_i²`**:\n    `Σ w_i² = 22² + 29² + 49² + 50² + 75²`\n    `Σ w_i² = 484 + 841 + 2401 + 2500 + 5625 = 11851`\n3.  **Substitute these values into the formula**:\n    `cn(L) = (11851 - 225) / (24 * 225)`\n    `cn(L) = 11626 / 5400`\n4.  **Simplify the fraction**:\n    `cn(L) = 5813 / 2700`\n\nThe fraction cannot be simplified further.\n\n<<<5813/2700>>>"
