The appropriate management for this patient involves a multi-phased approach. Immediately, her diabetes must be addressed through a medical consultation, and the avulsed teeth should be treated and replanted as a temporary measure to preserve the alveolar bone, accompanied by antibiotics and analgesics. The intermediate phase focuses on glycemic control and oral hygiene to ensure proper wound healing. For long-term restoration, considering her prognathic mandible (SNB of 88‚Å∞), a cast partial denture made of a Cobalt-Chromium framework with acrylic teeth is a suitable option. The abutment teeth would include the left central incisor and second premolar as primary abutments, and the right canine and first premolar for cross-arch stabilization. The cells of interest in the healing process are platelets, neutrophils, macrophages, fibroblasts, osteoblasts, and osteoclasts, whose function may be compromised by her diabetic condition.
