    "A power subgroup is another term for a cyclic subgroup, which is a subgroup generated by a single element. To determine the number of power subgroups in the generalized quaternion group of size 128, denoted as Q_128, we first need to understand its structure.\n\nThe generalized quaternion group of order 2<sup>n</sup> (where n ≥ 3) can be defined by the presentation:\nQ<sub>2<sup>n</sup></sub> = ⟨a, x | a<sup>2<sup>n-1</sup></sup> = 1, x<sup>2</sup> = a<sup>2<sup>n-2</sup></sup>, xax<sup>-1</sup> = a<sup>-1</sup>⟩\n\nFor Q_128, the order is 128 = 2<sup>7</sup>, so we have n=7. The group Q_128 has a presentation:\nQ<sub>128</sub> = ⟨a, x | a<sup>64</sup> = 1, x<sup>2</sup> = a<sup>32</sup>, xax<sup>-1</sup> = a<sup>-1</sup>⟩\n\nThe subgroups of a generalized quaternion group are either cyclic or themselves generalized quaternion groups. To find the number of power subgroups, we need to count the number of distinct cyclic subgroups.\n\nThe elements of Q_128 consist of:\n*   The 64 elements of the cyclic subgroup ⟨a⟩, which is isomorphic to the cyclic group C_64.\n*   The 64 elements of the form a<sup>i</sup>x for i = 0, 1, ..., 63.\n\nThe power subgroups can be determined as follows:\n1.  **Subgroups within ⟨a⟩**: The subgroup ⟨a⟩ is a cyclic group of order 64. The number of subgroups of a cyclic group of order *m* is equal to the number of divisors of *m*. The divisors of 64 (which is 2<sup>6</sup>) are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64. This gives a total of 7 cyclic subgroups, one for each divisor. These are the subgroups generated by powers of 'a'.\n\n2.  **Subgroups generated by elements outside of ⟨a⟩**: The elements not in ⟨a⟩ are of the form a<sup>i</sup>x. Every element of this form has an order of 4. Each of these 64 elements generates a cyclic subgroup of order 4. A cyclic group of order 4 has two generators (φ(4)=2). Therefore, these 64 elements form 64 / 2 = 32 distinct cyclic subgroups of order 4. These subgroups are distinct from the cyclic subgroups contained within ⟨a⟩ because they contain elements not in ⟨a⟩.\n\nCombining these, the total number of power (cyclic) subgroups is the sum of the subgroups from ⟨a⟩ and the additional subgroups generated by the other elements.\n\nTotal number of power subgroups = (Subgroups from ⟨a⟩) + (Subgroups from elements a<sup>i</sup>x)\nTotal = 7 + 32 = 39.\n\nTherefore, the generalized quaternion group of size 128 has 39 power subgroups.\n\n<<<39>>>"
