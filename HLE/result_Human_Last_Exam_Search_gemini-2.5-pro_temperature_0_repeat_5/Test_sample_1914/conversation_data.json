    "There are 21 non-isomorphic categories with 2 objects and 4 morphisms. This result is established in the field of enumerative category theory. The classification can be broken down by considering how the morphisms are distributed among the objects and how they compose.\n\nA category with two objects, let's call them A and B, must have at least two morphisms: the identity morphisms $id_A$ and $id_B$. This leaves two additional non-identity morphisms to be placed. The structure of the category is determined by the domains and codomains of these two morphisms, and by the rules of composition.\n\nThe 21 categories can be grouped into two main types:\n\n### Disconnected Categories (10 categories)\nThese are categories where there are no morphisms between the two objects A and B. The category is essentially a disjoint union of two separate categories, one for each object.\n\n*   **7 categories** arise when one object has three endomorphisms (morphisms from the object to itself) and the other has only the identity. The three endomorphisms must form a monoid of order 3. There are 7 non-isomorphic monoids of order 3, giving rise to 7 distinct categories of this type.\n*   **3 categories** arise when both objects have one non-identity endomorphism each. These two endomorphisms must form a monoid of order 2. There are two such monoids (one where the morphism is its own inverse, and one where it is idempotent). This gives three combinations: ($C_2$, $C_2$), ($C_2$, $U_1$), and ($U_1$, $U_1$), where $C_2$ is the cyclic group of order 2 and $U_1$ is the idempotent monoid.\n\n### Connected Categories (11 categories)\nThese are categories where there are morphisms connecting the objects A and B.\n\n*   **1 category** where both non-identity morphisms go from A to B. This is the \"parallel arrows\" category.\n*   **1 category** where there is one morphism from A to B and one from B to A, making the two objects isomorphic.\n*   **8 categories** that involve a morphism between A and B as well as an endomorphism on either A or B. These are further distinguished by the structure of the endomorphism monoid (of order 2) and the composition rules between the morphisms. For instance, one such category has a morphism $f: A \\to B$ and an endomorphism $g: B \\to B$ where $g \\circ g = id_B$ and the composition $g \\circ f = f$. The other categories in this group are variations of this theme, including their duals.\n*   **1 category** which is a more subtle construction. It is the free category generated by a pair of morphisms $f: A \\to B$ and $g: B \\to A$ with the relations $f \\circ g \\circ f = f$ and $g \\circ f \\circ g = g$. This structure is related to the concept of a regular semigroup.\n\nThis complete classification demonstrates the variety of simple categorical structures that can exist even with a small number of objects and morphisms.\n\n<<<21>>>"
