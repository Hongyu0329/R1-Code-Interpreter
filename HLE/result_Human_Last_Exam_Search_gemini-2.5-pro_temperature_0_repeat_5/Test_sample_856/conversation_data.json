    "A closed, orientable 3-manifold with a finite fundamental group is known as a spherical 3-manifold. According to the geometrization theorem, these are precisely the manifolds that can be written as the quotient of the 3-sphere, S³, by a finite group of isometries acting freely and orientation-preservingly. The group of orientation-preserving isometries of S³ is the special orthogonal group SO(4). Thus, the fundamental group of such a manifold must be isomorphic to a finite subgroup of SO(4) that can act freely on S³.\n\nThe structure of SO(4) is well understood. It is doubly covered by the direct product of two copies of the special unitary group SU(2), with the relationship being SO(4) ≅ (SU(2) × SU(2)) / {±(I, I)}. This means that any finite subgroup of SO(4) is the image of a finite subgroup of SU(2) × SU(2) under the covering map.\n\nThe finite subgroups of SU(2) are also completely classified and are known as the binary polyhedral groups. These include:\n*   Cyclic groups (Cₙ)\n*   Binary dihedral groups (BD₄ₙ)\n*   The binary tetrahedral group (order 24)\n*   The binary octahedral group (order 48)\n*   The binary icosahedral group (order 120)\n\nThe largest possible order for a finite subgroup of SU(2) is 120, the order of the binary icosahedral group. Consequently, the largest possible order for a finite subgroup of SU(2) × SU(2) is the product of the orders of the largest subgroups of each factor, which is 120 × 120 = 14,400.\n\nSince SO(4) is a quotient of SU(2) × SU(2) by a group of order 2, the maximum possible order for a finite subgroup of SO(4) is 14,400 / 2 = 7,200.\n\nThe question asks for the number of closed orientable 3-manifolds whose fundamental group has a cardinality of 10!. The value of 10! is:\n10! = 10 × 9 × 8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 3,628,800.\n\nThis number is significantly larger than the maximum possible order of 7,200 for a finite fundamental group of a 3-manifold. Therefore, no such group exists.\n\nFurthermore, for a finite group to act freely on S³, it must satisfy the condition that all of its abelian subgroups are cyclic. The symmetric group S₁₀, which has order 10!, contains a subgroup generated by the disjoint transpositions (1 2) and (3 4). This subgroup is isomorphic to the Klein four-group (ℤ/2ℤ × ℤ/2ℤ), which is an abelian but not a cyclic group. Therefore, S₁₀ cannot be the fundamental group of a closed orientable 3-manifold. This property provides an alternative reason why many large groups, including S₁₀, are ruled out.\n\nSince no group of cardinality 10! can be the fundamental group of a closed orientable 3-manifold, the number of such manifolds is zero.\n\n<<<0>>>"
