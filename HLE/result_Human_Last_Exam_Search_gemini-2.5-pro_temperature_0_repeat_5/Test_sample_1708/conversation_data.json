    "The order type of the set of finite strings of characters $\\{a, b, c, d\\}$ ordered lexicographically is a specific kind of countable linear order. While it does not have a common, single designated name like $\\omega$ (the order type of the natural numbers) or $\\eta$ (the order type of the rational numbers), it can be precisely described by its structural properties.\n\nLet's denote the alphabet as $\\Sigma = \\{a, b, c, d\\}$ and the set of all finite strings over this alphabet as $\\Sigma^*$. The lexicographical ordering on $\\Sigma^*$ has the following characteristics:\n\n1.  **Countable with a Minimum Element**: The set $\\Sigma^*$ is countably infinite. It has a least element, which is the empty string ($\\epsilon$).\n\n2.  **Not Well-Ordered**: The set is not well-ordered. A set is well-ordered if every non-empty subset has a least element. In this set, consider the subset $\\{b, ab, aab, aaab, ...\\}$. This subset has no lexicographically smallest element, as the sequence is infinitely decreasing.\n\n3.  **Not Dense**: The order is not dense. A dense order requires that for any two distinct elements, there is another element between them. In this set, there are \"gaps\". For example, there is no string that lies between \"a\" and \"aa\".\n\nThe structure of this ordered set can be visualized as an infinite 4-ary tree, where the nodes are the strings. The empty string is the root, and the children of any string `s` are `sa`, `sb`, `sc`, and `sd`. The lexicographical order corresponds exactly to the **pre-order traversal** of this tree.\n\nThis structure gives rise to a recursive definition of its order type, let's call it $\\tau$. The set begins with the empty string (contributing 1 to the order type), followed by the block of all strings starting with 'a', then all strings starting with 'b', and so on. Each of these blocks is order-isomorphic to the entire set. This leads to the following equation for the order type:\n$\\tau = 1 + \\tau + \\tau + \\tau + \\tau = 1 + 4\\tau$\n\nThis equation serves as a precise characterization of the order type.\n\nFurthermore, this order type is isomorphic to the order type of a specific subset of the rational numbers. Consider the mapping where the empty string maps to 0, and a string $s_1s_2...s_n$ maps to a base-5 number $0.d_1d_2...d_n$, with the digits corresponding to the characters as follows: $a \\to 1, b \\to 2, c \\to 3, d \\to 4$. The resulting set of numbers, with the usual ordering of rational numbers, is order-isomorphic to the set of strings.\n\n<<<The order type is the unique countable linear order $\\tau$ with a minimum element that satisfies the recursive relation $\\tau = 1 + 4\\tau$. This is the order type of the set of nodes of an infinite 4-ary tree under pre-order traversal.>>>"
