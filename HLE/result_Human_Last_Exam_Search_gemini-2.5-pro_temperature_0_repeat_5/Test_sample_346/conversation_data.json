    "The provided expression in SKI combinator logic, `S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(S(S(K(S))(K))(I)))))(S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I))))`, represents a Church integer `n`. To find the value of `log_2(n)`, we must first determine the integer `n`.\n\nA direct, step-by-step reduction of this complex expression is highly prone to error. A more effective approach is to recognize the higher-level arithmetic operations on Church numerals that the combinators represent. Church numerals are a way to represent natural numbers as functions in lambda calculus and SKI combinator calculus.\n\nThe given expression can be interpreted as a formula involving the addition, multiplication, and exponentiation of Church numerals. The structure of the expression corresponds to the formula:\n\n`n = (pow 2) ((pow 2) (add 1 (mul 2 2)))`\n\nHere, `add`, `mul`, and `pow` are the functions for addition, multiplication, and exponentiation, respectively, operating on Church numerals. The numbers `1` and `2` are also represented as Church numerals. The evaluation of this formula proceeds as follows:\n\n1.  **Multiplication:** `mul 2 2` corresponds to the multiplication of the Church numerals for 2 and 2, which results in the Church numeral for 4.\n2.  **Addition:** `add 1 4` is the addition of the Church numerals for 1 and 4, yielding the Church numeral for 5.\n3.  **First Exponentiation:** `pow 2 5` represents the exponentiation `2^5`. In Church numeral arithmetic, `m^n` is represented by the application `n m`. Thus, `pow 2 5` is equivalent to `5 2`, which evaluates to the Church numeral for `2^5 = 32`.\n4.  **Second Exponentiation:** `pow 2 32` is equivalent to `32 2`, which evaluates to the Church numeral for `2^32`.\n\nTherefore, the integer `n` represented by the SKI expression is `2^32`.\n\nTo find `log_2(n)`, we perform the final calculation:\n\n`log_2(n) = log_2(2^32) = 32`\n\n<<<32>>>"
