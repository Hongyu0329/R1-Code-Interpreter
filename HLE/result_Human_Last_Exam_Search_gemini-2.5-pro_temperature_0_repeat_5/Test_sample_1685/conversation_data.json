    "To find an analytical expression that approximates the solution for the ordinary differential equation (ODE) in the large $x$ regime, we first analyze the behavior of each term as $x \\to \\infty$.\n\nThe given ODE is:\n$y''' = y^{4} + y'^{4} - \\frac{y''}{3 x^{2} + 2} + \\frac{1}{\\tan{\\left(x \\right)} + 1}$\n\nFor large values of $x$:\n*   The term $\\frac{y''}{3 x^{2} + 2}$ becomes negligible, provided that $y''$ does not grow faster than $x^2$.\n*   The term $\\frac{1}{\\tan{\\left(x \\right)} + 1}$ is a bounded, oscillating function (except at its singularities). In the context of finding a dominant asymptotic behavior, such an oscillating term is often considered subdominant compared to terms that might grow or decay according to a power law.\n\nTherefore, for large $x$, we can approximate the ODE by considering the dominant nonlinear terms:\n$y''' \\approx y^{4} + y'^{4}$\n\nWe look for a solution of the form $y(x) = A x^n$. Let's substitute this into the simplified equation.\n*   $y'(x) = A n x^{n-1}$\n*   $y''(x) = A n (n-1) x^{n-2}$\n*   $y'''(x) = A n (n-1) (n-2) x^{n-3}$\n\nThe equation becomes:\n$A n (n-1) (n-2) x^{n-3} \\approx (A x^n)^4 + (A n x^{n-1})^4 = A^4 x^{4n} + A^4 n^4 x^{4n-4}$\n\nTo find the dominant balance, we must match the power of $x$ on the left-hand side with the dominant power on the right-hand side.\n\n**Case 1: Balancing $y'''$ with $y^4$**\nThis assumes the $y^4$ term is dominant on the right-hand side. This occurs if $4n > 4n-4$, which is always true.\nWe set the powers equal:\n$n - 3 = 4n \\implies 3n = -3 \\implies n = -1$.\n\nWith $n=-1$, let's check the powers of the terms in our approximate equation:\n*   $y'''$: $x^{n-3} = x^{-4}$\n*   $y^4$: $x^{4n} = x^{-4}$\n*   $y'^4$: $x^{4n-4} = x^{-8}$\n\nFor large $x$, the $x^{-4}$ terms are dominant over the $x^{-8}$ term. Thus, the balance $y''' \\approx y^4$ is self-consistent.\nNow, we balance the coefficients for $n=-1$:\n$A(-1)(-1-1)(-1-2) = A^4$\n$A(-1)(-2)(-3) = A^4$\n$-6A = A^4$\nAssuming $A \\neq 0$, we have $A^3 = -6$.\n$A = \\sqrt{-6}$\n\n**Case 2: Balancing $y'''$ with $y'^4$**\nThis assumes the $y'^4$ term is dominant on the right. This would require $n$ to be such that $4n-4 > 4n$, which is impossible. Let's check the balance anyway.\n$n - 3 = 4n - 4 \\implies 3n = 1 \\implies n = 1/3$.\n\nWith $n=1/3$, let's check the powers:\n*   $y'''$: $x^{n-3} = x^{-8/3}$\n*   $y^4$: $x^{4n} = x^{4/3}$\n*   $y'^4$: $x^{4n-4} = x^{-8/3}$\n\nHere, the $y^4$ term ($x^{4/3}$) is dominant on the right-hand side for large $x$. Our assumption to balance $y'''$ with $y'^4$ is therefore inconsistent.\n\nThe only consistent power-law solution for $x \\to \\infty$ is $y(x) \\sim A x^{-1}$ with $A = \\sqrt{-6}$.\n\nNow, we calculate the numerical value of A and round it to two decimal places.\n$A = \\sqrt{-6} \\approx -1.81712$\nRounding to two decimal places, we get $A \\approx -1.82$.\n\nThus, the analytical expression that approximates the solution for large $x$ is:\n$y(x) \\approx -\\frac{1.82}{x}$\n\nNote: The initial conditions suggest the solution will initially grow rapidly, likely leading to a finite-time singularity. In that context, the \"large $x$\" regime would be the behavior as $x$ approaches the singularity point. However, that analysis does not yield a single analytical expression without unknown constants ($x_0$ and an integration constant). The decaying solution $y(x) \\sim A/x$ is the only viable asymptotic solution for $x \\to \\infty$ that can be extracted from the dominant terms of the ODE.\n\n<<<y(x) = -1.82/x>>>"
