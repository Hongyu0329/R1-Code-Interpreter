    "When two Chern insulators, each with a Chern number of 1, are connected laterally with a negligible tunneling barrier, the Chern number of the resulting junction is 2.\n\nA Chern insulator is a two-dimensional material characterized by a topological invariant known as the Chern number. This number is an integer and dictates the number of protected, one-way conducting edge states that exist at the boundary of the material.\n\nWhen two topological systems are combined, their topological invariants, such as the Chern number, are generally additive. In this scenario, the two Chern insulators are brought into close contact, as indicated by the \"negligible tunneling barrier,\" effectively forming a single, larger topological system. The total Chern number of this composite system is the sum of the Chern numbers of its individual components.\n\nThis principle is supported by theoretical and experimental studies of composite topological systems. For instance, a bilayer system composed of two Chern insulators is characterized by a total Chern number that is the sum of the individual layer's Chern numbers. Similarly, for systems with multiple distinct components, the overall Chern number can be broken down into the sum of winding numbers associated with each subsystem.\n\nTherefore, for the given junction of two Chern insulators, each with a Chern number of 1, the total Chern number of the combined system is 1 + 1 = 2.\n\n<<<2>>>"
