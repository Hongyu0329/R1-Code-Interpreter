    "A tame functor $f: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K$ from an upper semilattice $J$ to the category of $K$-vector spaces is **n-resolvable for some finite integer n**.\n\nIn homological algebra, a functor is called \"n-resolvable\" if it has a projective resolution of length at most $n$. The smallest such $n$ is known as the projective dimension of the functor.\n\nHere is a breakdown of why this is the case:\n\n*   **Tame Functors:** A functor is called \"tame\" if its behavior is determined by its values on a finite sub-poset. This finiteness property is crucial for ensuring that homological invariants, like the length of a resolution, are finite.\n\n*   **Upper Semilattices:** An upper semilattice is a type of partially ordered set (poset) where every finite, non-empty set of elements has a least upper bound. This structure is particularly well-behaved for homological algebra.\n\n*   **Projective Resolutions:** In the category of functors from a poset to vector spaces, every functor has a projective resolution. For functors defined on an upper semilattice, it is a known result that every object admits a *finite* projective resolution. This means that for any given functor $f$, there exists a finite integer $n$ such that it is $n$-resolvable.\n\nThe specific value of $n$ for a given tame functor $f$ depends on the complexity of the functor itself, particularly on the finite poset that defines it. However, the key property is that this number $n$ is always finite.\n\n<<<a finite integer>>>"
