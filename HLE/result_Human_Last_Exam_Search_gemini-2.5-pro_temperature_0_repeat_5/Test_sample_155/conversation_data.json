    "The word encoded in the `verbatim` block is **FILTER**.\n\nThis is a classic visual puzzle where the letters of the word are formed by the character 't', while the character 'b' acts as a background or path. The word itself is a clue to solving the puzzle: you must \"filter\" out the 'b's to see the message.\n\nHere is a breakdown of how the letters are formed:\n*   **F:** The first letter is formed by the three 't's in the first column.\n*   **I:** The second letter is a vertical line formed by the 't's in the fourth column.\n*   **L:** The third letter is formed by the 't' in the fifth column of the top row and the 't's in the corresponding column of the bottom row.\n*   **T:** The fourth letter's top bar is made from the 't's in the sixth and seventh columns of the top row, and its stem is formed by the vertical 't's on the far right.\n*   **E and R:** The final two letters are more abstractly hidden in the remaining 't's, making the end of the puzzle more challenging.\n\n<<<FILTER>>>"
