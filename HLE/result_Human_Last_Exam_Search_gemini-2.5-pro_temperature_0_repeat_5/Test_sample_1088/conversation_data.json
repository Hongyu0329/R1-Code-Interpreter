    "The number of primitive Gaussian functions in a 6-311G** basis set is not a single, fixed value; it is dependent on the specific atom being described. The notation \"6-311G**\" provides the recipe for how many primitives are used for different parts of an atom's electronic structure.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the notation:\n*   **Primitive vs. Contracted Functions**: A basis set is a set of mathematical functions used to build molecular orbitals. In many computational chemistry methods, these basis functions are constructed from a combination of more fundamental functions called primitive Gaussian functions. A basis function can be a single primitive or a linear combination of several primitives, which is then called a contracted Gaussian function.\n*   **6-311G**: This part of the name describes a \"split-valence, triple-zeta\" basis set.\n    *   The first number, **6**, indicates that each core atomic orbital (like the 1s orbital in Carbon) is represented by a single contracted basis function composed of 6 primitive Gaussians.\n    *   The numbers **311** indicate that the valence orbitals are \"split\" into three basis functions of different sizes (a triple-zeta representation). For each valence atomic orbital, there is one contracted function made of 3 primitives, a second function made of 1 primitive, and a third function also made of 1 primitive.\n*   **\\*\\***: The two asterisks denote the addition of polarization functions, which improve the description of chemical bonding by allowing orbitals to change shape.\n    *   The first asterisk (`*`) adds a set of d-type polarization functions to all \"heavy\" atoms (i.e., atoms other than hydrogen and helium). This set consists of uncontracted primitive Gaussians. For Pople-style basis sets, this typically means 6 Cartesian d-functions are added (d<sub>x²</sub>, d<sub>y²</sub>, d<sub>z²</sub>, d<sub>xy</sub>, d<sub>xz</sub>, d<sub>yz</sub>), which corresponds to 6 primitive Gaussians.\n    *   The second asterisk (`*`) adds a set of p-type polarization functions to light atoms (hydrogen and helium). This adds 3 uncontracted p-functions (p<sub>x</sub>, p<sub>y</sub>, p<sub>z</sub>), corresponding to 3 primitive Gaussians.\n\n### Calculation for Specific Atoms:\n\nBased on this breakdown, we can calculate the number of primitive Gaussians for specific atoms:\n\n*   **For a Hydrogen (H) atom:**\n    *   Hydrogen has only a 1s valence orbital. According to the \"311\" split, this is described by 3 + 1 + 1 = 5 primitive Gaussians.\n    *   The second asterisk adds a set of p-type polarization functions, which consists of 3 primitive Gaussians.\n    *   **Total for Hydrogen = 5 (for s) + 3 (for p) = 8 primitive Gaussians.**\n\n*   **For a second-row atom (e.g., Carbon, Nitrogen, Oxygen):**\n    *   **Core (1s orbital):** Described by **6** primitive Gaussians.\n    *   **Valence (2s orbital):** Described by 3 + 1 + 1 = **5** primitive Gaussians.\n    *   **Valence (2p orbitals):** There are three 2p orbitals (p<sub>x</sub>, p<sub>y</sub>, p<sub>z</sub>). Each is described by 3 + 1 + 1 = 5 primitives, for a total of 3 × 5 = **15** primitive Gaussians.\n    *   **Polarization:** The first asterisk adds a set of d-type polarization functions, which consists of **6** primitive Gaussians.\n    *   **Total for a second-row atom = 6 (1s) + 5 (2s) + 15 (2p) + 6 (d) = 32 primitive Gaussians.**\n\nIt is important to note that for third-row atoms (like Sulfur or Chlorine), the 6-311G basis set often uses a different, more complex scheme, such as the McLean-Chandler basis sets, rather than following the simple \"6-311\" rule. For example, a Sulfur atom in a 6-311G** basis set has 27 primitive Gaussians.\n\n<<<For a Hydrogen atom, there are 8 primitive Gaussians. For a second-row atom like Carbon, there are 32 primitive Gaussians.>>>"
