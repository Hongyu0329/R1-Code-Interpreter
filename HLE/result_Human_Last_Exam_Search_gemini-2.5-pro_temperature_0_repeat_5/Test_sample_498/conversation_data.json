    "The sequence ZXXCVYBN_ is a pattern based on the standard QWERTY keyboard layout.\n\nThe main sequence of letters, Z, X, C, V, B, N, corresponds to the letters on the bottom row of the keyboard, read from left to right. The sequence is interrupted by two other letters, an extra 'X' and a 'Y'.\n\nThe complete pattern can be understood as two interleaved sequences:\n*   **Sequence 1:** The first, third, fifth, and seventh letters (Z, X, V, B) are from the bottom row of the keyboard.\n*   **Sequence 2:** The second, fourth, and sixth letters (X, C, Y, N) also follow a pattern, but it is less straightforward.\n\nHowever, a simpler and more common interpretation of such puzzles is that they follow a single, continuous path on the keyboard. If we trace the letters Z -> X -> X -> C -> V -> Y -> B -> N on a QWERTY keyboard, we can observe the typist's finger movements.\n\nA more direct interpretation is that the sequence lists letters from the keyboard rows, with some variation. The core of the sequence is Z, X, C, V, B, N, which are the first six letters of the bottom row. The next letter in this primary sequence would be M.\n\nLet's re-examine the given sequence: ZXXCVYBN. It appears to be a combination of two distinct sequences.\n*   One sequence is Z, X, C, V, B, N... which are the letters on the bottom row of a QWERTY keyboard.\n*   The other letters, X and Y, are interspersed.\n\nGiven the strong evidence of the QWERTY keyboard's bottom row forming the primary pattern, the most logical next letter is the one that follows N on that row.\n\nTherefore, the next letter in the sequence is M.\n\n<<<M>>>"
