    "Adult Raphidiopterans, commonly known as snakeflies, are primarily predatory insects. They have been recorded feeding on a diet that includes both other insects and plant-based substances.\n\nSpecifically, their diet includes:\n*   **Aphids**: Adult snakeflies are known predators of small, soft-bodied arthropods, with a distinct preference for aphids.\n*   **Nectar and Pollen**: In addition to being predatory, some adult snakeflies feed on nectar, pollen, or honeydew. Pollen has been found in the digestive tracts of snakeflies, although it is not definitively known if it is an essential part of their diet.\n\nBased on the provided choices, snakeflies have been recorded feeding on both nectar and aphids. They have not been documented feeding on fungus or leaf tissue. While they do eat pollen, and Māhoe is a source of pollen, and they do eat aphids, which could be found on a Tōtara tree, the most accurate and encompassing choice is the one that combines their known primary food sources.\n\n<<<F>>>"
