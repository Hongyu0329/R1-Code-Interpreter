    "Based on available mycological information, there is no known genus of mushroom that produces a distinctly blue spore print.\n\nWhile several species of mushrooms exhibit a blue coloration on their caps or stems, their spore prints are of different colors. For instance, the strikingly blue *Entoloma hochstetteri* from New Zealand has a pink spore print. Similarly, the *Lactarius indigo*, a North American mushroom with a blue cap and blue latex, produces a yellowish-cream spore print.\n\nOther mushrooms, such as the *Stropharia caerulea* (Blue Roundhead), have a blue-green cap but their spore print is purple-brown to purple-black. Some mushrooms are known for bruising blue, a characteristic often associated with psilocybin-containing species, but this coloration change in the flesh is not related to their spore color. For example, many species in the genus *Psilocybe* bruise blue but have a dark purple-brown spore print.\n\nTherefore, despite the existence of blue-colored mushrooms, a blue spore print is not a known characteristic of any fungal genus.\n\n<<<There is no known mushroom genus that produces a distinctly blue spore print.>>>"
