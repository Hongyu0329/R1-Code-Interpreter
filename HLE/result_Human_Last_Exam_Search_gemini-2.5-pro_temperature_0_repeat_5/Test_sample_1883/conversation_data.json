    "Under thermal conditions, the electrocyclization of \\((2Z,4Z,6Z,8E)\\)-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene is governed by the principles of Frontier Molecular Orbital (FMO) theory, as explained by the Woodward-Hoffmann rules.\n\n1.  **Electron Count and Reaction Type**: Deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene is a polyene containing 8 π-electrons. An electrocyclic reaction involving 8 π-electrons is classified as a 4n system, where n=2.\n\n2.  **FMO Analysis and Mode of Cyclization**: For a thermal pericyclic reaction in a 4n π-electron system, FMO theory predicts that the reaction proceeds through a **conrotatory** ring closure. This is because the Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO) of the ground-state tetraene has terminal p-orbitals with lobes of the same phase on opposite sides of the molecular plane. A conrotatory motion, where both termini rotate in the same direction (either both clockwise or both counter-clockwise), is required to bring these lobes of like phase together to form the new sigma (σ) bond.\n\n3.  **Stereochemical Outcome**: The specific stereochemistry of the starting material, \\((2Z,4Z,6Z,8E)\\)-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene, dictates the stereochemistry of the product.\n    *   The substituents at the ends of the conjugated system are methyl groups.\n    *   In a conrotatory closure, both methyl groups will rotate in the same direction. Due to the specific Z and E configurations of the double bonds in the starting material, both possible conrotatory pathways (clockwise or counter-clockwise) result in the two methyl groups ending up on the same side of the newly formed eight-membered ring.\n    *   This leads exclusively to the formation of the *cis*-isomer, which is *cis*-7,8-dimethylcycloocta-1,3,5-triene (Isomer A).\n\n4.  **Product Ratio**: The formation of the *trans*-isomer (Isomer B) would necessitate a disrotatory ring closure, which is symmetry-forbidden under thermal conditions for an 8π-electron system. Therefore, FMO theory predicts that the reaction is highly stereospecific, and Isomer B is not formed.\n\nBased on this analysis, the reaction should yield 100% of the *cis*-isomer (A) and 0% of the *trans*-isomer (B).\n\n<<<The reaction exclusively produces the cis-isomer A. Therefore, the ratio of A to B is 1:0.>>>"
