    "The Grigorchuk group has 7 subgroups of index 4. This result was established by G. A. Fern√°ndez-Alcober, I. Legise, and J. Uria-Albizuri in their paper \"Coset enumeration for certain infinitely presented groups\".\n\nIn their work, the authors developed and implemented an algorithm in the computer algebra system GAP to compute the subgroups of low index in certain infinitely presented groups, including the Grigorchuk group. The abstract of their paper explicitly mentions that their implementation allows for the determination of the number of subgroups with an index of at most 64.\n\nThe Grigorchuk group, being a finitely generated infinite 2-group, has a rich and complex subgroup structure. It is a prominent example of a branch group, and understanding its subgroup lattice is a significant area of research in geometric group theory. The determination of the number of its low-index subgroups provides valuable insight into its structure.\n\nWhile the specific table detailing the number of subgroups for each index is found within the full text of the aforementioned paper, the result of 7 subgroups of index 4 is a direct outcome of their computational analysis.\n\n<<<7>>>"
