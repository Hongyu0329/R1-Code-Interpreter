    "To determine which flags of African nations have the same linear algebraic rank as the flag of Denmark, we must first establish the rank of the Danish flag and then analyze the flags of African nations.\n\n### 1. Rank of the Flag of Denmark\n\nThe flag of Denmark, the Dannebrog, features a white Nordic cross on a red field. To analyze its rank, we can represent it as a matrix where different colors correspond to different, linearly independent values. A simplified 3x3 matrix that captures the essence of the design is:\n\n```\n[ R, W, R ]\n[ W, W, W ]\n[ R, W, R ]\n```\n\nHere, 'R' represents the red field and 'W' represents the white cross. To maximize the rank, we assume R and W are distinct non-zero numbers. In this matrix, the first and third rows are identical. This linear dependence means the rank cannot be 3. However, the first and second rows are linearly independent (as one is not a scalar multiple of the other, assuming R â‰  W). Therefore, the maximal rank of the Danish flag, when viewed as a matrix, is **2**.\n\n### 2. Analysis of African Flags\n\nWe now seek African national flags that also have a maximal rank of 2. This requires analyzing their geometric structures. A flag's design will result in a rank of 2 if it has some form of repetition or alignment in its pattern, causing linear dependence in its matrix representation, but is not as simple as basic horizontal or vertical stripes (which have a rank of 1).\n\nThe following African nations have flags whose geometric patterns result in a rank of 2:\n\n*   **Flags with a Triangle at the Hoist:** Nations whose flags feature horizontal stripes with a triangle at the hoist. This design creates a matrix where one column (representing the triangle) is distinct, but the other columns (representing the stripes) are linearly dependent.\n    *   **Sudan:** Red, white, and black horizontal stripes with a green triangle.\n    *   **South Sudan:** Black, red, and green horizontal stripes (separated by white fimbriations) with a blue triangle.\n    *   **Mozambique:** Green, black, and yellow horizontal stripes (separated by white fimbriations) with a red triangle.\n    *   **Equatorial Guinea:** Green, white, and red horizontal stripes with a blue triangle.\n    *   **Zimbabwe:** Seven horizontal stripes with a white triangle at the hoist.\n    *   **Comoros:** Four horizontal stripes with a green triangle.\n    *   **Djibouti:** Light blue and green horizontal stripes with a white triangle.\n\n*   **Flags with a Central Vertical Element:** Flags that feature a central emblem or stripe overlaying horizontal bands. This creates identical columns on either side of the central element.\n    *   **Kenya:** A horizontal tricolor with a large Maasai shield and spears in the center.\n    *   **Uganda:** Six horizontal stripes with a central white disc containing a grey crowned crane.\n    *   **Eswatini (formerly Swaziland):** Five horizontal stripes with a large shield and spears in the center.\n\n*   **Flags with Intersecting Stripes:**\n    *   **Central African Republic:** Four horizontal stripes are crossed by a single vertical red stripe, creating linear dependence among the columns on either side of the central stripe.\n\n*   **Flags with a Pall (Y-shape):**\n    *   **South Africa:** The distinctive Y-shape (or pall) creates a design where the structure on the hoist side can be represented by linearly dependent columns.\n\nThese flags, through their specific geometric compositions of triangles, palls, or central emblems over striped fields, share the same linear algebraic rank of 2 as the flag of Denmark.\n\n<<<Sudan, South Sudan, Mozambique, Equatorial Guinea, Zimbabwe, Comoros, Djibouti, Kenya, Uganda, Eswatini, Central African Republic, South Africa>>>"
