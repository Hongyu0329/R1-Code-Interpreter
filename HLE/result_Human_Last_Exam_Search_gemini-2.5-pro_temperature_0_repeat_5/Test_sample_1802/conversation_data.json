    "A Pauli channel, denoted as $\\Lambda$, acting on a $d$-dimensional quantum system (a qudit), is a quantum channel that can be described by Kraus operators proportional to the generalized Pauli operators. The maximal rank of the complementary channel of $\\Lambda$ is $d^2$.\n\nHere is a step-by-step derivation of this result:\n\n### 1. The Pauli Channel and its Kraus Operators\nA qudit is a quantum system with a $d$-dimensional Hilbert space. The generalized Pauli operators, $\\{U_k\\}_{k=0}^{d^2-1}$, form a complete orthogonal basis for the space of $d \\times d$ matrices. A Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ can be expressed in the Kraus representation as:\n$\\Lambda(\\rho) = \\sum_{k=0}^{d^2-1} p_k U_k \\rho U_k^\\dagger$\nwhere $\\rho$ is the density matrix of the qudit, the coefficients $p_k$ are non-negative probabilities that sum to one ($\\sum_k p_k = 1$), and $U_k$ are the generalized Pauli operators. The Kraus operators for this channel are $A_k = \\sqrt{p_k} U_k$.\n\n### 2. The Complementary Channel\nAny quantum channel can be understood as a system interacting with an environment, after which the environment is discarded. The complementary channel describes the resulting state of the environment when the original system is traced out.\n\nGiven a set of Kraus operators $\\{A_k\\}$ for a channel $\\Lambda$, the Choi matrix of its complementary channel $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$ is a matrix $M$ whose elements are given by:\n$M_{ij} = \\text{Tr}(A_i^\\dagger A_j)$\n\nThe rank of the complementary channel is the rank of this matrix $M$.\n\n### 3. Calculating the Rank\nLet's compute the matrix elements $M_{ij}$ for the Pauli channel:\n$M_{ij} = \\text{Tr}((\\sqrt{p_i} U_i)^\\dagger (\\sqrt{p_j} U_j))$\n$M_{ij} = \\sqrt{p_i p_j} \\text{Tr}(U_i^\\dagger U_j)$\n\nA key property of the generalized Pauli operators is their orthogonality under the trace inner product. Specifically:\n$\\text{Tr}(U_i^\\dagger U_j) = d \\cdot \\delta_{ij}$\nwhere $d$ is the dimension of the qudit and $\\delta_{ij}$ is the Kronecker delta, which is 1 if $i=j$ and 0 otherwise.\n\nSubstituting this into the expression for $M_{ij}$:\n$M_{ij} = \\sqrt{p_i p_j} \\cdot d \\cdot \\delta_{ij}$\n\nThis equation shows that $M$ is a diagonal matrix. Its diagonal entries are:\n$M_{ii} = p_i \\cdot d$\nAnd its off-diagonal entries ($i \\neq j$) are zero.\n\n### 4. Determining the Maximal Rank\nThe rank of a diagonal matrix is equal to the number of its non-zero diagonal entries. The $i$-th diagonal entry of $M$ is $d \\cdot p_i$. Since the dimension $d$ is at least 2, this entry is non-zero if and only if the probability $p_i$ is non-zero.\n\nThe rank of the complementary channel is therefore the number of non-zero probabilities $p_k$ in the definition of the Pauli channel. To find the *maximal* possible rank, we consider the case where all possible Pauli errors can occur, meaning all $p_k$ can be greater than zero.\n\nThere are $d^2$ generalized Pauli operators for a $d$-dimensional system. If we construct a Pauli channel that is a mixture of all $d^2$ of these operators with non-zero probabilities (for example, the depolarizing channel), then all $d^2$ values of $p_k$ will be non-zero. In this case, the rank of the matrix $M$ will be $d^2$.\n\nTherefore, the maximal rank of the complementary channel of a Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ on a qudit of dimension $d$ is $d^2$.\n\n<<<d^2>>>"
