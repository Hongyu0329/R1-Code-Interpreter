    "The Oscar-nominated film in which a character's fate is sealed in a bus scene is the 2010 Canadian film *Incendies*, directed by Denis Villeneuve. The film was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film in 2011.\n\nThe pivotal and harrowing bus scene in *Incendies* does not feature a character sealing their fate by saying \"Thank you.\" Instead, the protagonist, Nawal Marwan, is traveling on a bus with other Muslim refugees when it is attacked by Christian nationalists during a civil war. The attackers shoot the driver and then open fire on the passengers. Nawal survives by showing the attackers her crucifix, proving that she is a Christian. She attempts to save a young girl by claiming her as her own, but the girl is tragically killed when she runs towards the burning bus, calling for her mother. This traumatic event is a turning point for Nawal, leading her to join the Muslim fighters.\n\nWhile the bus scene is a crucial and fateful moment in the film, the detail about the phrase \"Thank you\" is not a part of this sequence. The scene's significance lies in the brutal violence Nawal witnesses and survives, which profoundly impacts the course of her life.\n\n<<<Incendies>>>"
