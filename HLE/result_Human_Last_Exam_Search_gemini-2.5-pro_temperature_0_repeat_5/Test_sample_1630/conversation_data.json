    "To determine the maximum number of fixed points that $f(g(x))$ can have, we need to find the maximum number of real solutions to the equation $f(g(x)) = x$.\n\n1.  **Analyze the function and its properties:**\n    *   Let $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ be polynomials of degree 3.\n    *   The composition $h(x) = f(g(x))$ is a polynomial of degree $3 \\times 3 = 9$.\n    *   The fixed points of $h(x)$ are the roots of the polynomial equation $h(x) - x = 0$.\n    *   A polynomial of degree 9 can have at most 9 real roots. Therefore, the number of fixed points is at most 9.\n\n2.  **Analyze the constraints on the derivatives:**\n    *   We are given that $f'(x) > 0$ and $g'(x) > 0$ for all real numbers $x$.\n    *   This means that both $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are strictly increasing functions.\n    *   The derivative of the composite function $h(x)$ is given by the chain rule: $h'(x) = f'(g(x)) \\cdot g'(x)$.\n    *   Since $f'(y) > 0$ for any real number $y$ and $g'(x) > 0$ for all $x$, their product $h'(x)$ must also be positive for all $x$.\n    *   Thus, $h(x) = f(g(x))$ is also a strictly increasing function. A strictly increasing function can intersect the line $y=x$ multiple times.\n\n3.  **Investigate if 9 fixed points are achievable:**\n    *   We want to determine if it's possible for the equation $h(x) - x = 0$ to have 9 distinct real roots, given the constraints on $f$ and $g$.\n    *   Let $P(x) = h(x) - x$. For $P(x)$ to have 9 distinct real roots, by Rolle's Theorem, its derivative $P'(x)$ must have at least 8 distinct real roots.\n    *   The derivative is $P'(x) = h'(x) - 1$.\n    *   Let's determine the degree of $h'(x)$.\n        *   Since $f(x)$ is a degree 3 polynomial, its derivative $f'(x)$ is a degree 2 polynomial.\n        *   Since $g(x)$ is a degree 3 polynomial, its derivative $g'(x)$ is a degree 2 polynomial.\n        *   The term $f'(g(x))$ involves substituting a degree 3 polynomial into a degree 2 polynomial, resulting in a polynomial of degree $2 \\times 3 = 6$.\n        *   Therefore, $h'(x) = f'(g(x)) \\cdot g'(x)$ is a polynomial of degree $6 + 2 = 8$.\n    *   So, $P'(x) = h'(x) - 1$ is a polynomial of degree 8. A polynomial of degree 8 can have at most 8 real roots.\n    *   Thus, it is possible for $P'(x)$ to have 8 distinct real roots, which is a necessary condition for $P(x)$ to have 9 distinct real roots.\n\n4.  **Further conditions for 9 fixed points:**\n    *   For $P(x) = h(x) - x$ to have 9 distinct real roots, its 8 local extrema (which occur at the roots of $P'(x)=0$) must have alternating signs (e.g., local max > 0, local min < 0).\n    *   The roots of $P'(x)=0$ are the solutions to $h'(x) = 1$. This means the graph of the polynomial $y=h'(x)$ must intersect the horizontal line $y=1$ at 8 distinct points.\n    *   As $h'(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 8 with a positive leading coefficient (since the leading coefficients of $f$ and $g$ can be chosen to be positive, which is required for $f'$ and $g'$ to be positive for large $x$), its graph starts at $+\\infty$ for $x \\to -\\infty$ and goes to $+\\infty$ for $x \\to +\\infty$. For it to intersect a horizontal line 8 times, it must have 7 local extrema (4 local minima and 3 local maxima). The values at the local minima must be less than 1, and the values at the local maxima must be greater than 1.\n    *   The existence of such polynomials $f$ and $g$ is not immediately obvious, but there is no clear mathematical principle that forbids it. The constraints that $f'(x)$ and $g'(x)$ are positive quadratics are not restrictive enough to prevent $h'(x)$ from oscillating in a way that allows for 8 roots of $h'(x)=1$. By carefully choosing the coefficients of $f$ and $g$, one can construct such a function. For instance, one can create \"wiggles\" in the graph of $h(x)$ by making its slope $h'(x)$ pass above and below 1. The constant terms in the polynomials can then be adjusted to shift the graph of $h(x)$ vertically to ensure it intersects $y=x$ at 9 distinct points.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    The number of fixed points is the number of roots of the polynomial equation $f(g(x)) - x = 0$, which is of degree 9. Therefore, the maximum possible number of fixed points is 9. The analysis shows that the conditions imposed on $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ do not fundamentally restrict this maximum number. It is theoretically possible to construct polynomials $f$ and $g$ that satisfy the given conditions and result in a composite function $f(g(x))$ with 9 fixed points.\n\nThe maximum number of fixed points that $f(g(x))$ can have is 9.\n\n<<<9>>>"
