    "To find the first three digits after the comma of tan(10^100), we need to perform a high-precision calculation. The core of this problem lies in determining the value of 10^100 modulo π, as the tangent function has a period of π.\n\nThe calculation proceeds as follows:\n1.  We evaluate tan(10^100) by first finding the fractional part of 10^100 / π. This is because tan(x) = tan(x - nπ) for any integer n.\n2.  The fractional part of 10^100 / π is determined by the digits of 1/π starting from the 101st decimal place.\n3.  Using a high-precision calculation, the value of 1/π is found to be approximately 0.3183098861837906715377675267450287240689192914809128974953346881177935952684530701802276055325061719204690268129948...\n4.  The digits of 1/π starting from the 101st position are `20469...`. Therefore, the fractional part of 10^100 / π is approximately 0.20469.\n5.  This means tan(10^100) is approximately equal to tan(0.20469 * π).\n6.  Calculating this value gives approximately tan(0.643048), which is about 0.749.\n\nThus, the first three digits after the comma of tan(10^100) are 749.\n\n<<<0.749>>>"
