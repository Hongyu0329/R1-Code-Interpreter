    "Following the application of cellular automaton Rule 110 for 20 successive iterations starting from a single cell in state 1, the resulting binary pattern is `11011101101111111101`.\n\nThe evolution of the pattern is governed by the following rules, where the state of a cell in the next generation is determined by its current state and the state of its two immediate neighbors:\n\n*   **111** → 0\n*   **110** → 1\n*   **101** → 1\n*   **100** → 0\n*   **011** → 1\n*   **010** → 1\n*   **001** → 1\n*   **000** → 0\n\nStarting with a single '1' (generation 0), the pattern expands and evolves with each iteration. The sequence of patterns, omitting leading and trailing zeros, corresponds to the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) sequence A070887. The 20th term in this evolutionary process yields the aforementioned binary string.\n\n<<<11011101101111111101>>>"
