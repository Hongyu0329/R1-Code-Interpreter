    "### The Three Longest Rivers Mentioned in Virgil's Aeneid\n\nVirgil's epic poem, the Aeneid, weaves a narrative rich with geographical references, both real and mythological. Among the numerous bodies of water mentioned, three real-world rivers stand out for their significant length: the Aras (referred to as the Araxes), the Meriç (anciently known as the Hebrus), and the Tiber.\n\nThe longest of these is the **Aras River**, which flows for approximately 1,072 kilometers (666 miles). In the Aeneid, it is mentioned as the \"Araxes,\" a river in Armenia that was famously difficult for the Romans to bridge, symbolizing a distant and formidable boundary of the Roman world.\n\nThe second longest is the **Meriç River**, known in antiquity as the Hebrus. It has a length of about 480 kilometers (300 miles). The Hebrus is located in the Balkans and is associated with the myth of Orpheus.\n\nThe third is the **Tiber River**, the most prominent river in the Aeneid as it is central to the founding of Rome. The Tiber flows for approximately 406 kilometers (252 miles) through Italy. In the epic, the river god Tiberinus appears to Aeneas in a dream, confirming his destiny in Italy.\n\nAnother river mentioned is the Gela in Sicily, but it is significantly shorter, with a length of about 59 to 74 kilometers, and therefore not among the longest.\n\nIn addition to these real-world rivers, the Aeneid also features the mythological rivers of the Underworld: the Styx, Acheron, Phlegethon, Cocytus, and Lethe. As these are mythical, their lengths are not quantifiable and thus are not included in this ranking of the longest rivers.\n\n<<<The three longest rivers mentioned in the Aeneid are the Aras (Araxes), the Meriç (Hebrus), and the Tiber.>>>"
