    "The puzzle is a transformation rule applied to a grid of numbers. Let's deduce the rule from the given examples.\n\n### Analysis of the Transformation Rule\n\n1.  **Identify the Changes:**\n    *   In **Input_A** (`001111,121111,111111`) to **Output_A** (`201111,101111,111111`), the `2` at position (row 1, column 1) becomes a `0`, and the `0` at position (row 0, column 0) becomes a `2`.\n    *   In **Input_B** (`...111100211...`) to **Output_B** (`...111100021...`), the `2` at (row 3, column 6) becomes a `0`, and the `0` at (row 2, column 7) becomes a `2`.\n\n2.  **Formulate a Hypothesis:**\n    The transformation involves the number `2` moving to a new position. The original position of the `2` becomes a `0`, and the new position, which was originally a `0`, becomes a `2`. The core of the puzzle is to determine the destination of the `2`.\n\n3.  **Determine the Movement Rule:**\n    Let's analyze the relationship between the `2`'s starting position and its destination. The destination is always one of the eight neighboring cells.\n\n    *   **Example A:** The `2` is at `(1,1)`. Its neighbors containing `0` are at `(0,0)` (North-West) and `(0,1)` (North). The `2` moves to `(0,0)`, which is North-West.\n    *   **Example B:** The `2` is at `(3,6)`. Its neighbors containing `0` are at `(2,5)` (North-West), `(2,6)` (North), `(2,7)` (North-East), and `(3,5)` (West). The `2` moves to `(2,7)`, which is North-East.\n\n    This suggests a priority order for the direction of movement. Let's test a priority order:\n    1.  North-East (NE)\n    2.  North-West (NW)\n    3.  (and so on...)\n\n    *   **Applying to Example A:** The `2` is at `(1,1)`.\n        *   Is the NE neighbor `(0,2)` a `0`? No, it's `1`.\n        *   Is the NW neighbor `(0,0)` a `0`? Yes.\n        *   The `2` moves to the NW position. This matches the output.\n\n    *   **Applying to Example B:** The `2` is at `(3,6)`.\n        *   Is the NE neighbor `(2,7)` a `0`? Yes.\n        *   The `2` moves to the NE position. This matches the output.\n\n    The rule is confirmed: The `2` moves to the first available `0` in its neighborhood, checking in the order of priority, starting with North-East, then North-West.\n\n### Solving for Input_C\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to `Input_C`.\n\n*   **Input_C:**\n    ```\n    000000\n    011120\n    111111\n    ```\n\n1.  **Locate the '2'**: The `2` is at position (row 1, column 4).\n\n2.  **Check Neighbors for '0' based on priority**:\n    *   **North-East (NE)**: The cell at (row 0, column 5). The value is `0`.\n    *   Since we found a `0` at the first priority direction (NE), this will be the destination for the `2`.\n\n3.  **Perform the Transformation**:\n    *   The `2` at `(1,4)` moves to `(0,5)`.\n    *   The value at `(1,4)` becomes `0`.\n    *   The value at `(0,5)` becomes `2`.\n\n4.  **Construct the Output**:\n    *   **Row 0**: `000000` becomes `000002`.\n    *   **Row 1**: `011120` becomes `011100`.\n    *   **Row 2**: `111111` remains unchanged.\n\nCombining these rows gives the final result.\n\n<<<000002,011100,111111>>>"
