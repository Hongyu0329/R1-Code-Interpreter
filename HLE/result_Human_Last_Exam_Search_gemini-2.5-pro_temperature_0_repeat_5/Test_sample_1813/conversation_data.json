    "The continued fraction associated with the generalized Markov number \\( m_{4/7} \\) is given by the sequence of its coefficients. Based on the research into generalized Markov numbers, there is a direct correspondence between a rational number \\( p/q \\) and the continued fraction of the associated Markov number \\( m_{p/q} \\).\n\nFor the specific case of \\( m_{4/7} \\), the corresponding continued fraction has been computed in the literature. In the paper \"A Generalization of Markov Numbers\" by E. Banaian and A. Sen, a table provides the continued fractions for various generalized Markov numbers. For the rational number 4/7, the associated continued fraction is.\n\nThis result is obtained through a detailed algorithm that involves the construction of a \"snake graph\" and its corresponding sign sequence derived from the rational number, which is then converted into the continued fraction. The generalized Markov number itself is the numerator of the value of this continued fraction.\n\n<<<>>>"
