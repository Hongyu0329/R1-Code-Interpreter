The highest concentration of an individual chemical reaching the spring is **Atrazine at 0.061 Î¼g/L**.

The effect of the mixture is assessed using the Toxic Unit model, which assumes **additivity**. The calculated Mixture Toxic Unit (MTU) at the time of the peak concentration is approximately **0.00063**. As this value is substantially less than 1, no significant toxic effect on the protected algal community is predicted from the chemical mixture.
