    "The group G is generated by permutations on a set of 12 elements. The generators are:\n*   a = (1, 3, 2, 5, 4, 7, 6, 9, 8, y, x)\n*   b = (1, 8, 5, 9)(4, x, 7, 6)\n*   c = (1, 2)(3, z)(4, 8)(5, 6)(7, y)(9, x)\n\nBy their structure, particularly the presence of an 11-cycle, these generators strongly suggest that the group G is the Mathieu group M₁₂. The Mathieu group M₁₂ is a sporadic simple group of order 95,040.\n\nThe Schur multiplier, denoted here as A, is the second homology group H₂(G, ℤ). For the Mathieu group M₁₂, the Schur multiplier is a cyclic group of order 2, denoted as ℤ₂. There was some initial confusion in the literature, with an early paper claiming the multiplier was trivial, but this was later corrected.\n\nThe group A is therefore isomorphic to ℤ₂, the cyclic group of order 2. The subgroups of ℤ₂ are the trivial subgroup {e} and the group ℤ₂ itself. A proper subgroup of a group is a subgroup that is not equal to the group itself. Therefore, the only proper subgroup of ℤ₂ is the trivial subgroup.\n\nUp to isomorphism, there is only one trivial group. Thus, there is only one proper subgroup of A up to isomorphism.\n\n<<<1>>>"
