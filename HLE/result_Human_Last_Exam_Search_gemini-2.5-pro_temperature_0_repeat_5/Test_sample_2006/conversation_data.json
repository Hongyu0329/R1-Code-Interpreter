    "The haiku describes the events of 1978 in the Catholic Church, a year known as the \"Year of Three Popes\".\n\n*   **\"An August tempest\"** refers to the death of Pope Paul VI on August 6, 1978. His death created a significant and unexpected upheaval within the church.\n*   **\"Twice fifteen brings winds of change\"** alludes to the subsequent papacy of Pope John Paul I, which lasted only 33 days, a period of approximately \"twice fifteen\" or 30 days. His brief reign and sudden death brought further \"winds of change\" to the Vatican.\n*   **\"A divine one yields\"** signifies the death of a pope, who is considered a \"divine one\" or the Vicar of Christ on Earth. This line can refer to the death of Pope Paul VI and then the subsequent death of Pope John Paul I.\n\nThe title, \"The Bays,\" is a metaphorical question. \"Bays\" can refer to a laurel wreath, a symbol of honor or a crown. In this context, \"The Bays\" is a poetic way of asking, \"Who were the crowned heads?\" or \"Who were the Popes?\".\n\nThe answer to this question is the list of the three popes who reigned in 1978. In alphabetical order, they are:\n\n<<<John Paul I, John Paul II, Paul VI>>>"
