    "The symmetry group of the molecule with the SMILES string C#Cc1cc2ccc3c(C#C)cc4ccc5c(C#C)cc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67 is **D3h**.\n\nThis molecule is a derivative of a class of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons known as triangulenes. The core structure of triangulene possesses D3h symmetry. The SMILES string describes a large, planar, triangular-shaped molecule where three ethynyl (-C≡CH) groups are attached to the \"corners\" of the triangulene core in a symmetric fashion.\n\nA visualization of the molecule generated from the SMILES string confirms this high-symmetry structure. The key symmetry elements that define the D3h point group for this molecule are:\n\n*   **A principal C3 axis of rotation:** This axis is perpendicular to the plane of the molecule and passes through its center. A rotation of 120 degrees around this axis leaves the molecule unchanged.\n*   **Three C2 axes of rotation:** These axes are perpendicular to the C3 axis and lie within the molecular plane. Each C2 axis passes through the center of the molecule and one of the ethynyl-substituted corners.\n*   **A horizontal mirror plane (σh):** This is the plane in which all the atoms of the molecule lie.\n*   **Three vertical mirror planes (σv):** Each of these planes contains the principal C3 axis and one of the C2 axes.\n*   **An S3 improper rotation axis:** This involves a 120-degree rotation followed by a reflection through the horizontal mirror plane.\n\nThe combination of these symmetry elements unequivocally places the molecule in the D3h point group.\n\n<<<D3h>>>"
