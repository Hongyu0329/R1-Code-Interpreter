    "A notable distinction between the Vaganova and Balanchine methods in the execution of a *cambré derrière* (a bend backwards) lies in the placement of the hips.\n\nIn the Balanchine method, there is a characteristic use of an open hip. George Balanchine believed that allowing the hip of the working leg to open creates the illusion of a higher and more extended line in movements like an arabesque, which is closely related to the *cambré derrière*. This technique results in a more modern and neoclassical aesthetic, sometimes described as having \"swaying hips.\" Some dancers are taught in the Balanchine style to lift the leg as high as possible, even if it means sacrificing a perfectly square hip alignment.\n\nConversely, the Vaganova method places a strong emphasis on maintaining a square and level placement of the hips. This Russian method prioritizes precision and the development of strength and stability from a correctly aligned core and pelvis. In a Vaganova-style arabesque or backbend, the ideal is to keep the hips \"squared off\" to build a strong and elegant line from the foundation of the supporting leg.\n\nWhile there are also differences in arm and head placement between the two styles, the approach to the hips is a more fundamental and defining distinction in movements that involve lifting the leg to the back. The Balanchine method is often noted for its speed and the Vaganova method for its meticulous and powerful adagio, but in the specific mechanics of a *cambré derrière*, the hip placement is a key differentiator.\n\n<<<B>>>"
