    "The number of self-intersection points for a Lissajous curve defined by the parametric equations x(t) = cos(at) and y(t) = sin(bt), where 'a' and 'b' are integers, can be determined by a well-established formula.\n\nThe given curve is (cos(9t), sin(5t)), which is a Lissajous curve with frequencies a = 9 and b = 5.\n\nFor a Lissajous curve where 'a' and 'b' are coprime integers, the number of self-intersection points depends on the parity of 'a' and 'b'. In this case, a = 9 and b = 5 are both odd integers and they are coprime (their greatest common divisor is 1).\n\nThe formula for the number of self-intersection points when both 'a' and 'b' are odd and coprime is:\nNumber of self-intersections = (a - 1)(b - 1) / 2\n\nSubstituting the given values of a = 9 and b = 5 into the formula:\nNumber of self-intersections = (9 - 1)(5 - 1) / 2\nNumber of self-intersections = (8)(4) / 2\nNumber of self-intersections = 32 / 2\nNumber of self-intersections = 16\n\nThe use of cosine for the x-component and sine for the y-component introduces a phase shift, but for generic Lissajous curves where the frequencies are coprime, this does not alter the number of self-intersection points.\n\nTherefore, the curve consisting of all points (cos(9t), sin(5t)) has 16 self-intersection points.\n\n<<<16>>>"
