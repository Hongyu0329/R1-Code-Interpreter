    "The number of involutions in the projective special unitary group PSU(4,997) is given by the formula `q^4 * (q^4 + q^2 + 1)`, where `q = 997`.\n\nAn involution in a group is an element that is its own inverse. In the context of PSU(4,997), these are elements of order 2. The calculation involves analyzing the structure of the special unitary group SU(4,997) and its center. The involutions in PSU(4,997) arise from elements `g` in SU(4,997) such that `g^2` is in the center of SU(4,997).\n\nFor the specific group PSU(4,997), we have `q = 997`. Plugging this value into the formula gives:\n\nNumber of involutions = `997^4 * (997^4 + 997^2 + 1)`\n\nCalculating the numerical value:\n*   `997^2 = 994,009`\n*   `997^4 = (997^2)^2 = 988,053,848,081`\n*   `997^4 + 997^2 + 1 = 988,053,848,081 + 994,009 + 1 = 988,054,842,091`\n*   Number of involutions = `988,053,848,081 * 988,054,842,091 = 976,219,899,931,653,778,115,871`\n\n<<<976219899931653778115871>>>"
