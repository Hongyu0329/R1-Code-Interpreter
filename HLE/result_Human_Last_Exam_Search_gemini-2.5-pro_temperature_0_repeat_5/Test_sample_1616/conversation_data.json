    "Of the words listed, **southern** has not undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\nTrisyllabic laxing is a sound change process in English where a tense (or long) vowel becomes lax (or short) when it is in the third-to-last syllable of a word, often as a result of adding a suffix.\n\nHere is an analysis of each word:\n*   **derivative**: This word shows trisyllabic laxing. The vowel in the root word *derīve* (/aɪ/) becomes lax in *der**i**vative* (/ɪ/). The affected syllable is the third from the end.\n*   **serenity**: This is a classic example of trisyllabic laxing. The tense vowel in *ser**e**ne* (/iː/) becomes a lax vowel in *ser**e**nity* (/ɛ/).\n*   **gratitude**: This word also underwent trisyllabic laxing. The tense vowel in the related word *gr**a**teful* (/eɪ/) is lax in *gr**a**titude* (/æ/).\n*   **pleasant**: This word has not undergone *trisyllabic* laxing because it only has two syllables. The vowel shortening that occurs between *please* and *pleasant* is due to a different rule, often called pre-cluster shortening.\n*   **shadow**: This word is also disyllabic and therefore not subject to trisyllabic laxing. The vowel difference between *shade* and *shadow* is an ancient change that dates back to different inflected forms in Old English.\n*   **southern**: This word has not undergone trisyllabic laxing because it is disyllabic. The vowel shortening in *southern* (/ʌ/) compared to its root word *south* (/aʊ/) is an example of a different historical sound change. Furthermore, trisyllabic laxing primarily affects words of Latin or French origin, whereas `southern` is a native Germanic word.\n\nWhile `pleasant` and `shadow` are also not examples of trisyllabic laxing, `southern` is a distinct case due to its Germanic etymology and the specific type of vowel shortening it demonstrates.\n\n<<<southern>>>"
