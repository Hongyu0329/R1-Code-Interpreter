(a) No. The correct relationship is \(d_n(t) = t H(\mathcal{U}_{n-1, E})(t)\). The degree of the Hilbert series \(H(\mathcal{U}_{n-1, E})(t)\) is the rank of the matroid minus one. Since the rank of \(\mathcal{U}_{n-1, E}\) is \(n-1\), the degree of \(H(\mathcal{U}_{n-1, E})(t)\) is \((n-1) - 1 = n-2\).

(b) Yes. The degree of the derangement polynomial \(d_n(t)\) is \(n-1\) for \(n \geq 1\). This degree corresponds to the maximum number of excedances a derangement in \(S_n\) can have. The leading coefficient is the number of derangements that achieve this maximum. For \(n \geq 2\), the
