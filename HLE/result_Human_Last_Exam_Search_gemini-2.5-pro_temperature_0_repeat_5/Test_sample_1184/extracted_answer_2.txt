The interaction between the human alpha-1 and beta-1 subunits of the voltage-gated calcium channel 2.3 is primarily mediated by the Alpha-Interaction Domain (AID) on the alpha-1 subunit and the Alpha-Binding Pocket (ABP) within the guanylate kinase (GK) domain of the beta-1 subunit. While a comprehensive list of hotspot residues on the human beta-1 subunit is not fully detailed in the provided search results, the GK domain is the critical interaction site. One key residue identified in the highly similar beta-3 subunit is Arginine-307, suggesting a corresponding residue in the beta-1 subunit is a hotspot for this interaction.

The fine-tuning of the alpha-1 subunit's gating properties by the beta-1 subunit is a complex process involving multiple domains. The GK domain itself is sufficient to modulate gating. The N-terminus of the beta-1 subunit is also crucial, particularly for regulating inactivation kinetics. Furthermore, the Src Homology 3 (SH3) domain and the connecting HOOK region play significant roles in the overall modulation of the channel's function. The precise amino acid residues within these domains of the human beta-1 subunit that act as hotspots for gating modulation of Cav2.3 are still an active area of research.
