    "It is not possible to determine the exact number of *pas de Balanchine* Svetlana Gileva performed in the Jete Woman solo scene of William Forsythe's \"In the Middle, Somewhat Elevated\" with the Semperoper Ballett in 2015.\n\nA video of this specific performance, which would be required for a precise count of the choreographic steps, is not publicly available. While reviews from the period and subsequent tours confirm that Svetlana Gileva performed in this role to great acclaim, they do not provide a detailed breakdown of the choreography.\n\nFurthermore, William Forsythe's choreographic style is renowned for its deconstruction and extension of classical ballet technique, often transforming traditional steps into something new and complex. This makes the identification of a specific, conventional step like a *pas de Balanchine* within his work challenging.\n\nInterestingly, the solo is often referred to as the \"jeté pas,\" which emphasizes a different ballet step—the *jeté*, a type of jump. This suggests the solo's signature movement may not be the *pas de Balanchine* at all. Without visual evidence or a choreographic score, any count would be purely speculative.\n\n<<<0>>>"
