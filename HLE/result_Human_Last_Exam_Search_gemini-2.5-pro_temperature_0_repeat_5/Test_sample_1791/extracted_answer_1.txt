The effective electron-electron interaction, mediated by phonons, for a given momentum transfer $\mathbf{q}$ and Matsubara frequency $i\omega_n$ is:
$V_{eff}(\mathbf{q}, i\omega_n) = - \frac{g^2 q^2/m}{\omega_n^2 + w_q^2}$
This interaction is attractive (since $V_{eff} < 0$) and retarded, meaning it depends on the frequency (i.e., the time difference between the interacting electrons). In the static limit ($\omega_n=0$), the interaction is $V_{eff}(\mathbf{q}) = - \frac{g^2 q^2}{m w_q^2}$.
