    "Here is the scansion of the Latin hexameter line: \"verum ubi equi atque hominis casu convenit imago.\"\n\nThe line is scanned as follows, with \"D\" representing a dactyl (long-short-short) and \"S\" representing a spondee (long-long):\n\n**D - S - S - S - D - S**\n\nHere is a foot-by-foot breakdown:\n\n1.  **vē-r(um) u-bĭ**: Dactyl. The first syllable is long. The final \"-um\" of *verum* is elided with the initial \"u\" of *ubi*.\n2.  **ē-qu(i) āt-que**: Spondee. This foot presents a known difficulty. For the line to scan, the short \"e\" in *equi* is treated as long (a poetic license known as substitution), and the final \"-i\" is elided with the initial \"a\" of *atque*. The syllable *at-* is long by position.\n3.  **hŏ-mĭ-nīs**: Spondee. The final syllable, \"-nis,\" is long by position as it is followed by the two consonants \"c\" and \"s\" from *casu*.\n4.  **cā-sū cōn-**: Spondee. The syllables *cā-* and *-sū* are both long by nature.\n5.  **vē-nĭt ĭ-**: Dactyl. The *vē-* in *convenit* is long by nature (perfect tense). The *-nit* is short, and the initial \"i\" of *imago* is short.\n6.  **mā-gō**: Spondee. The \"-ma-\" in *imago* is long by nature (ablative singular), and the final \"-o\" is treated as long.\n\n<<<D S S S D S>>>"
