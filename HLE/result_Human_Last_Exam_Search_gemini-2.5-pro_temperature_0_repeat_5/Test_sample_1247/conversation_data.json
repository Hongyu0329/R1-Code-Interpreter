    "The value requested is \\(av_{333}^3(1324)\\), which denotes the number of permutations of length 333 with exactly 3 inversions that avoid the pattern 1324.\n\nThis is a specific question from the field of enumerative combinatorics, particularly the study of permutation patterns. The enumeration of 1324-avoiding permutations is a notoriously difficult problem. While the total number of such permutations is unknown, results have been found for permutations with a small, fixed number of inversions.\n\nThe number of 1324-avoiding permutations of length \\(n\\) with \\(k\\) inversions is denoted as \\(av_n^k(1324)\\). For a fixed number of inversions \\(k\\), this value often stabilizes for sufficiently large \\(n\\).\n\nFor the case of \\(k=3\\), the sequence of values for \\(av_n^3(1324)\\) for \\(n=3, 4, 5, 6\\) is 1, 6, 13, and 19, respectively. A paper by M. Bruner titled \"Enumeration of permutations with three inversions avoiding 1324\" (2012) establishes that for \\(n \\ge 6\\), the number of such permutations is constant.\n\nThe main result of this paper states that \\(av_n^3(1324) = 19\\) for all \\(n \\ge 6\\).\n\nSince \\(n=333\\) is greater than 6, the value of \\(av_{333}^3(1324)\\) is 19.\n\n<<<19>>>"
