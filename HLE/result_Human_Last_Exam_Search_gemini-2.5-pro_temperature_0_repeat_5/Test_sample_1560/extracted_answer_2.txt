The final state of the system after the measurement of ququint A is not a single state but a probabilistic distribution of five possible states. Depending on the measurement outcome for ququint A, the combined system collapses into one of the following configurations:
1.  With a probability of 2/10, the final state is $|0\rangle_A \otimes \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|1\rangle_B + |3\rangle_B)$.
2.  With a probability of 2/10, the final state is $|1\rangle_A \otimes \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rangle_B + |2\rangle_B)$.
3.  With a probability of 3/10, the final state is $|2\rangle_A \otimes \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}(|0\rangle_B + |3\rangle_B + |4\rangle_B)$.
4.  With a probability of 2/10, the final state is $|3\rangle_A \otimes \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|1\rangle_B + |4\rangle_B)$.
5.  With a probability of 1/10, the final state is $|4\rangle_A \otimes |2\rangle_B$.
