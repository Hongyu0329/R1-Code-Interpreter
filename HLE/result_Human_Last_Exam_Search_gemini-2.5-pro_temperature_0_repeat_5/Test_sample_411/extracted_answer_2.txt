**(a) Diversity Order:**
*   The diversity order for code $\mathbf{S}_a$ is 1.
*   The diversity order for code $\mathbf{S}_b$ is 1.
*   The diversity order for code $\mathbf{S}_c$ is 2.

**(b) Maximum Directivity:**
*   Code $\mathbf{S}_c$ provides the maximum directivity (interpreted as coding gain). This is because it is an orthogonal space-time block code that achieves full diversity and guarantees a non-zero coding gain, unlike codes $\mathbf{S}_a$ and $\mathbf{S}_b$.
