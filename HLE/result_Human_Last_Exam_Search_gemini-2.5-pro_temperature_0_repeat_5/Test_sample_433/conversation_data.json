    "For a single-dose container ampule, the Beyond-Use Date (BUD) from the time of puncture in a sterile environment is immediate use. Any remaining contents must be discarded and cannot be stored for any period.\n\nOnce an ampule is opened, it becomes an open system, which makes it susceptible to microbial contamination. Therefore, to ensure patient safety, the contents must be used right away.\n\nAccording to the United States Pharmacopeia (USP) and the National Association of Pharmacy Regulatory Authorities (NAPRA), opened single-dose ampules should not be stored. This is a critical guideline in sterile compounding to prevent the administration of contaminated medications.\n\nIt is important to distinguish between a single-dose ampule and a single-dose vial. While both are intended for a single use, a single-dose vial with a septum may be used for up to 12 hours after the initial puncture if it remains in an ISO Class 5 or cleaner air quality environment. However, this does not apply to ampules, which cannot be resealed.\n\n<<<Immediate use; any unused portion must be discarded.>>>"
