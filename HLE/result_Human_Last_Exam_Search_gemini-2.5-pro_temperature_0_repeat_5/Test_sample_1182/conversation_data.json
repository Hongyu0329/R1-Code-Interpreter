    "The stable reduction of the curve $y^2=8x+x^2+4x^3+4x^4+8x^5$ over the 2-adic numbers has **2** double points (nodes).\n\nHere is a summary of the derivation:\n1.  **Curve Transformation:** The given equation can be transformed into a more convenient model. By letting $Y = y-x$ and then $Y = 2Y_1$, the original equation is shown to be birationally equivalent to the integral model:\n    $Y_1^2 + xY_1 = x^3+x^4+2x+2x^5$\n    This transformation simplifies the analysis of the curve's reduction modulo 2.\n\n2.  **Reduction Modulo 2:** The special fiber of this new model is obtained by reducing the equation modulo 2:\n    $Y_1^2 + xY_1 = x^3+x^4$\n    This equation defines a singular algebraic curve over the field $\\mathbb{F}_2$.\n\n3.  **Analysis of Singularities:** The singularities of this reduced curve are investigated.\n    *   At the origin $(0,0)$, the lowest degree terms are $Y_1^2 + xY_1 = Y_1(Y_1+x)$, which corresponds to an ordinary double point (a node).\n    *   The curve also has a singularity at the point at infinity. An analysis of the projective closure of the curve reveals that this singularity is a cusp.\n\n4.  **Stable Reduction:** A stable curve, by definition, can only have ordinary double points as singularities. The presence of a cusp in our reduced model means it is not yet stable. The process of stable reduction involves resolving this cusp.\n    *   The node at the origin is a stable type of singularity and will persist in the stable reduction, contributing one double point.\n    *   The resolution of the cusp singularity will replace it with a configuration of rational curves, which introduces new double points at the intersection points. A detailed analysis of the cusp's resolution shows that it resolves into a single rational curve that intersects the main component of the curve at one new point, which is a node.\n\n5.  **Counting the Double Points:** The total number of double points in the stable reduction is the sum of the nodes from the original stable singularities and the new nodes created during the resolution process.\n    *   1 node from the original singularity at the origin.\n    *   1 new node from the resolution of the cusp at infinity.\n\nTherefore, the stable reduction of the curve has a total of 2 double points. The resulting stable curve has an arithmetic genus of 2, which is consistent with the genus of the original curve.\n\n<<<2>>>"
