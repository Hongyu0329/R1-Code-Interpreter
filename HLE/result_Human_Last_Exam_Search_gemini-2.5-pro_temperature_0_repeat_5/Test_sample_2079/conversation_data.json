    "I am unable to definitively identify the judge of Bártfa (now Bardejov) in 1461 based on the available search results.\n\nHistorical records confirm that Bártfa had a town council, a judge (*richtár*), and lay judges during this period. For instance, in 1461, Andrzej Trzeszko sent a formal invitation to the lay judges of Bártfa for talks. Furthermore, documents from July and September 1461 show correspondence with the \"citizens of Bártfa\" and mention István Cromer as the judge of Kassa, indicating the typical administrative structure of the time.\n\nScholarly research, particularly the work of Polish historian Stanisław Andrzej Sroka and Slovak historians Ferdinand Uličný and Mária Fedorčáková, has delved into the administration of medieval Bardejov. Specifically, Sroka's book, \"Średniowieczny Bardiów i jego kontakty z Małopolską\" (Medieval Bardejov and its contacts with Lesser Poland), is cited as containing a list of the town's 15th-century judges on pages 66-68. However, the specific name of the judge for the year 1461 is not mentioned in the accessible search snippets of this or other related academic works.\n\nWhile it is clear that a judge held office in Bártfa in 1461, the name of the individual is not available in the provided search results. Accessing the specific pages of Stanisław Andrzej Sroka's book would likely provide the definitive answer.\n\n<<<I am unable to answer the question.>>>"
