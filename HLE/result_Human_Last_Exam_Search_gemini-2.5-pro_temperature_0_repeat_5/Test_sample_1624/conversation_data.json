    "Yes, there is an upper bound on the cardinality of such a space $X$. The upper bound is $2^{\\aleph_0}$, the cardinality of the continuum.\n\nHere is a step-by-step justification:\n\n1.  The dense open subset $U$ is a subspace of the metric space $X$, and therefore, $U$ is itself a metric space. The condition that each point in $U$ has a neighborhood homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}$ means that $U$ is a 1-dimensional topological manifold.\n\n2.  A key theorem in topology states that any metrizable manifold is second-countable. Some definitions of a manifold even include second-countability as a requirement. Since $U$ is a metrizable 1-manifold, it must be second-countable.\n\n3.  A space is second-countable if it has a countable basis for its topology. A property of second-countable spaces is that they are also separable, which means they contain a countable dense subset. Let's call this countable dense subset of $U$ by the name $D_U$.\n\n4.  Since $D_U$ is dense in $U$ and $U$ is dense in $X$, it follows that $D_U$ is also dense in $X$. To see this, take any non-empty open set $O$ in $X$. Because $U$ is dense in $X$, the intersection $O \\cap U$ is non-empty and open. Since $D_U$ is dense in $U$, it must intersect every non-empty open subset of $U$, so $D_U \\cap (O \\cap U)$ is non-empty. This implies that $D_U \\cap O$ is non-empty, which proves that $D_U$ is dense in $X$.\n\n5.  We have now established that $X$ is a separable metric space because it contains the countable dense subset $D_U$.\n\n6.  For any separable metric space, there is an upper bound on its cardinality. The cardinality of a separable metric space is at most $2^{\\aleph_0}$. This can be shown by constructing an injective map from the space into the set of real-valued functions on its countable dense subset, which has cardinality $(2^{\\aleph_0})^{\\aleph_0} = 2^{\\aleph_0}$.\n\n7.  This upper bound is achievable. For example, if we take $X = \\mathbb{R}$ (the set of real numbers), it is a connected metric space with cardinality $2^{\\aleph_0}$. We can choose $U = X = \\mathbb{R}$, which is a dense open subset where every point has a neighborhood homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}$. Therefore, the upper bound of $2^{\\aleph_0}$ can be reached.\n\nIn summary, the properties of the dense open subset $U$ are strong enough to imply that the entire space $X$ must be separable, which in turn imposes a strict upper limit on its cardinality.\n\n<<<The cardinality of the space $X$ is at most $2^{\\aleph_0}$.>>>"
