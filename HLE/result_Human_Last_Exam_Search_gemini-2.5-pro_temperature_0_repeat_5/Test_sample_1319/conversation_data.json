    "After Mount Olympus, the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the *Iliad* is **Mount Parnassus**.\n\nWith its highest peak reaching 2,457 meters (8,061 feet), Mount Parnassus is a significant mountain in central Greece. It is mentioned in Homer's *Iliad* as home to several ancient communities. In Greek mythology, it was sacred to the gods Apollo and Dionysus and was considered the home of the Muses.\n\nFor comparison, Mount Olympus, the mythical abode of the Greek gods, stands as the highest mountain in Greece at approximately 2,917 meters (9,570 feet).\n\nAnother prominent mountain mentioned in the context of the *Iliad* and Greek mythology is Mount Ida. There are two mountains with this name: one on the island of Crete and another in modern-day Turkey, near the ancient city of Troy. The Mount Ida on Crete is the island's highest point at 2,456 meters (8,058 feet). The Mount Ida in Turkey, from which the gods were said to have witnessed the Trojan War, has an elevation of about 1,774 meters (5,820 feet).\n\nOther mountains mentioned in the epic include:\n*   **Mount Athos**: 2,033 meters (6,670 feet)\n*   **Mount Pelion**: 1,624 meters (5,328 feet)\n*   **Mount Samothrace (Fengari)**: 1,611 meters (5,285 feet), from which Poseidon is said to have watched the Trojan War.\n*   **Mount Neritum** on Ithaca: 800 meters (2,625 feet)\n\n<<<Mount Parnassus>>>"
