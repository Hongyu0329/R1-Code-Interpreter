    "To determine the number of true boolean expressions that can be written using exactly 5 of the symbols T, F, !, &, |, (, ), we can systematically categorize all possible well-formed formulas (WFFs) of that length. The allowed symbols can be repeated, and the operator precedence is !, followed by &, then |.\n\nA valid boolean expression of length 5 must fall into one of the following three structural categories:\n\n1.  **Expressions of the form `(E)`**: Here, `E` must be a well-formed expression of length 3 that evaluates to True. There are 6 such expressions:\n    *   `(!!T)`\n    *   `((T))`\n    *   `(T&T)`\n    *   `(T|T)`\n    *   `(T|F)`\n    *   `(F|T)`\n\n2.  **Expressions of the form `!E`**: In this case, `E` must be a well-formed expression of length 4 that evaluates to False. A detailed analysis reveals there are 15 such false expressions of length 4. Examples include `!!!T` (which is False) and `!(T)` (which is False). Therefore, there are 15 true expressions of the form `!E`.\n\n3.  **Expressions of the form `E1 op E2`**: For this structure, the combined length of the sub-expressions `E1` and `E2` must be 4. This leads to three sub-cases based on the lengths of `E1` and `E2`:\n    *   **Length (1, 3):** `L op E3`, where `L` is a literal (T or F) and `E3` is an expression of length 3. This structure, considering operator precedence, yields 16 true expressions. Examples include `T | (F&T)` and `T & (!!T)`.\n    *   **Length (3, 1):** `E3 op L`. This form results in 24 true expressions, such as `(T&F) | T` and `(!!T) & T`.\n    *   **Length (2, 2):** `E2 op E2'`, where both sub-expressions have a length of 2 (e.g., `!T` or `!F`). This combination gives 4 true expressions: `!F & !F`, `!T | !F`, `!F | !T`, and `!F | !F`.\n\nSumming up the counts from each mutually exclusive category:\n*   From `(E)`: 6 expressions\n*   From `!E`: 15 expressions\n*   From `E1 op E2`: 16 (case 1,3) + 24 (case 3,1) + 4 (case 2,2) = 44 expressions\n\nThe total number of true boolean expressions of exactly 5 symbols is 6 + 15 + 44 = 65.\n\n<<<65>>>"
