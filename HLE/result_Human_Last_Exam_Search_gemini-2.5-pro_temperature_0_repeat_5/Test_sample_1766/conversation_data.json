    "In the problem of spin-orbit coupling for a p-electron, the total angular momentum operator, **J**, is the sum of the orbital angular momentum operator, **L**, and the spin angular momentum operator, **S**. The operators for the square of the total angular momentum, **J²**, and the z-component of the total angular momentum, **Jz**, commute with each other, which means they share a common set of eigenstates. The eigenvalues of these operators are quantized and can be determined by the corresponding quantum numbers.\n\nFor a p-electron, the orbital angular momentum quantum number is *l* = 1. As an electron, its spin angular momentum quantum number is *s* = 1/2. The total angular momentum quantum number, *j*, can take values ranging from |*l* - *s*| to *l* + *s* in integer steps.\n\nTherefore, for a p-electron:\n*   *j* can be |1 - 1/2| = 1/2\n*   *j* can be 1 + 1/2 = 3/2\n\nThis results in two possible sets of states, one for *j* = 3/2 and another for *j* = 1/2.\n\nThe eigenvalues of the **J²** operator are given by the formula *j*(*j* + 1)ħ², where ħ is the reduced Planck constant. The eigenvalues of the **Jz** operator are given by *m*<sub>*j*</sub>ħ, where the magnetic quantum number *m*<sub>*j*</sub> can take values from -*j* to +*j* in integer steps.\n\nThe common eigenvalues for **J²** and **Jz** are therefore determined for each possible value of *j*:\n\n### For the state with j = 3/2:\n\n*   The eigenvalue of **J²** is (3/2)(3/2 + 1)ħ² = **(15/4)ħ²**.\n*   The possible values for *m*<sub>*j*</sub> are -3/2, -1/2, 1/2, and 3/2.\n*   The corresponding eigenvalues for **Jz** are **(-3/2)ħ, (-1/2)ħ, (1/2)ħ, and (3/2)ħ**.\n\nThus, the common eigenvalues for the *j* = 3/2 state are the pairs:\n*   ((15/4)ħ², (3/2)ħ)\n*   ((15/4)ħ², (1/2)ħ)\n*   ((15/4)ħ², (-1/2)ħ)\n*   ((15/4)ħ², (-3/2)ħ)\n\n### For the state with j = 1/2:\n\n*   The eigenvalue of **J²** is (1/2)(1/2 + 1)ħ² = **(3/4)ħ²**.\n*   The possible values for *m*<sub>*j*</sub> are -1/2 and 1/2.\n*   The corresponding eigenvalues for **Jz** are **(-1/2)ħ and (1/2)ħ**.\n\nThus, the common eigenvalues for the *j* = 1/2 state are the pairs:\n*   ((3/4)ħ², (1/2)ħ)\n*   ((3/4)ħ², (-1/2)ħ)\n\nThese two sets of eigenvalues represent the possible quantized values of the square of the total angular momentum and its z-component for a p-electron undergoing spin-orbit coupling.\n\n<<<For a p-electron with spin-orbit coupling, there are two possible values for the total angular momentum quantum number, j: 3/2 and 1/2.\n\nFor j = 3/2, the common eigenvalues are:\n- J² eigenvalue: (15/4)ħ²\n- Jz eigenvalues: (3/2)ħ, (1/2)ħ, (-1/2)ħ, (-3/2)ħ\n\nFor j = 1/2, the common eigenvalues are:\n- J² eigenvalue: (3/4)ħ²\n- Jz eigenvalues: (1/2)ħ, (-1/2)ħ>>>"
