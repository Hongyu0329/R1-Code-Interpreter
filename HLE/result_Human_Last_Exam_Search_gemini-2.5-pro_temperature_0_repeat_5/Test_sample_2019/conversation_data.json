    "The initial search has provided some very relevant information, but not the direct answer. Here's a summary of what has been found and what is still needed:\n\n**Information Found:**\n*   The problem of placing *n* non-attacking queens on an *n*x*n* toroidal board is solvable if and only if *n* is not divisible by 2 or 3. This is a theorem by George Pólya.\n*   For a 5x5 board, a solution with 5 non-attacking queens exists.\n*   The problem of placing *k* queens on an *n*x*n* board is a known combinatorial problem, but the toroidal aspect adds complexity.\n*   There is a related problem of placing 5 non-attacking knights on a 5x5 toroidal board, and the number of ways is 5! (120). This is because the graphs of rooks, bishops, and knights are isomorphic on this specific board. It is unclear if this applies to queens.\n*   A book by Vaclav Kotesovec, \"Non-attacking chess pieces,\" appears to be a comprehensive resource on such problems, but the specific answer for 4 queens on a 5x5 toroidal board is not in the provided snippets.\n*   There are discussions about the *n*-queens problem and its variations, including domination problems (covering the board) and solutions on standard boards.\n\n**Information Still Needed:**\n*   The exact number of ways to place **4** non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard. The existing results are for *n* queens on an *n*x*n* board.\n\nThe initial search was broad. Now, a more focused search is needed to find the specific number of arrangements for 4 queens. It's possible this is a known result that can be found in online encyclopedias of integer sequences or in specific mathematical papers.The second round of searches provided more specific and useful information, although a direct answer is still not explicitly stated. Here's a breakdown of the findings:\n\n*   **Pólya's Theorem:** It's reconfirmed that placing *n* non-attacking queens on an *n*x*n* toroidal board is possible if and only if *n* is not divisible by 2 or 3. This applies to placing 5 queens on a 5x5 board, but the current question is about 4 queens.\n*   **Counting Quasipolynomials:** The number of ways to place *q* non-attacking pieces on an *n*x*n* board can be described by a quasipolynomial in *n* of degree 2*q*. This is a general and powerful result from the work of Chaiken, Hanusa, and Zaslavsky. This suggests that a formula for 4 queens on an *n*x*n* board exists, and from that, the value for n=5 could be determined. The search did not, however, provide the specific quasipolynomial for 4 queens.\n*   **OEIS (Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences):** A search for a relevant OEIS sequence (A178619) was performed, but the description of the sequence is highly technical and it's not immediately clear if it directly answers the question. It seems related to binomial coefficients and might require deeper mathematical understanding to apply.\n*   **Related Problems:** The problem of 5 non-attacking knights on a 5x5 toroidal board is mentioned multiple times and has a known answer (120). The isomorphism between rooks, bishops, and knights on this specific board is highlighted, but queens are not included in this isomorphism.\n*   **Vaclav Kotesovec's Work:** The book \"Non-attacking chess pieces\" is again identified as a key resource. The snippets confirm it contains formulas for various non-attacking piece problems, including for *k* queens on an *n*x*n* board. It's highly probable the answer is in this book.\n\nThe next logical step is to try and find the specific formula or a direct statement of the result from a reliable source, likely Kotesovec's work or a specific paper that has calculated this value. Since I cannot directly access and read the book, I will try to find a direct quote or a table from his work or a related academic source that gives the number.The search results have consistently pointed to the work of Vaclav Kotesovec as a primary source for this type of problem. While a direct answer was not found in the snippets, the repeated references to his comprehensive book, \"Non-attacking chess pieces,\" strongly suggest the answer lies within. The searches also confirmed the complexity of the problem and the existence of formulas (quasipolynomials) for calculating these numbers, though the specific formula for 4 queens on a toroidal board was not retrieved. The consistent mention of Pólya's theorem for n queens on an n x n toroidal board is a useful piece of context but does not directly answer the question for k < n queens. Given the high likelihood of the answer being in Kotesovec's work and the inability to directly query the book's content, I will now try to find an online table or a direct quotation from his work that provides the specific number. This will be the final attempt to locate the exact value before concluding that it is not readily available through web search.The final search successfully located a crucial document: a PDF of Vaclav Kotesovec's \"Non-Attacking Chess Pieces, 3rd Edition, 2011\". Within the search snippets from this document, the key information was found. Specifically, a snippet mentions \"A172519 - 4 Queens, toroidal board nxn: (V. Kotovec, 5.2.2010)\". It states that the number of ways to place 4 non-attacking queens on a toroidal board can be expressed by a single formula or by 12 formulas corresponding to the board size modulo 12. While the snippet doesn't give the explicit formula for n=5, it confirms that the calculation is known and has been recorded. By searching for the OEIS sequence A172519, I can find the exact value for n=5.\n\nBased on the available information, I am now confident in providing the final answer.\n\nI will now search for the OEIS sequence A172519 to find the value for n=5.The search for OEIS A172519 did not directly yield a page for that specific sequence. However, the previous search confirmed that Vaclav Kotesovec has calculated the number of ways to place 4 non-attacking queens on an n x n toroidal board and that this sequence is cataloged as A172519. The most reliable way to find the specific value for n=5 is to search for a table of values for this sequence, likely within Kotesovec's work or the OEIS database itself. Since a direct lookup of A172519 was not immediately successful, a broader search for tables of non-attacking queen placements on toroidal boards is the next logical step. It is highly probable that the answer is documented, and a persistent search for these tables will uncover it.The search results from step 5, particularly the direct reference to Vaclav Kotesovec's comprehensive work \"Non-attacking chess pieces\" and the existence of OEIS sequences for these types of problems, confirm that the answer is likely documented. Although the specific value for 4 queens on a 5x5 toroidal board was not explicitly found in the snippets, the repeated mentions of Kotesovec's book and the cataloging of these problems in the OEIS provide a clear path to the solution. The problem is well-defined within the mathematical community, and the number of configurations has been calculated. Based on the high confidence that the answer is in these established resources, I can proceed to the final step. I will perform one last targeted search for the specific OEIS sequence value.\n\nFinal Answer: I will now search for the value of n=5 in the OEIS sequence A172519, which corresponds to the number of ways to place 4 non-attacking queens on an n x n toroidal board. This should provide the definitive answer."
