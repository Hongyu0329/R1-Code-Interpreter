    "In fuzzy logic, the activation level of a rule is determined by applying a t-norm operation to the firing strength of the antecedent and the membership degree of the consequent. The firing strength, represented as `Phi_k(x′)`, is given as 0.7, and the membership degree of the consequent, `μG_k_j(y_j)`, is 0.9.\n\nA t-norm, or triangular norm, is a function that generalizes the logical 'AND' operation for fuzzy logic. While there are several types of t-norms, the most common are the minimum t-norm and the product t-norm. In the absence of a specified t-norm, the minimum operator is often used by default as it represents the basic intersection of fuzzy sets.\n\nUsing the minimum t-norm, the calculation is as follows:\nRule Activation Level = min(Φ_k(x′), μG_k_j(y_j))\nRule Activation Level = min(0.7, 0.9)\nRule Activation Level = 0.7\n\nIf the product t-norm were to be used, the calculation would be:\nRule Activation Level = Φ_k(x′) * μG_k_j(y_j)\nRule Activation Level = 0.7 * 0.9\nRule Activation Level = 0.63\n\nAssuming the standard and most frequently used minimum t-norm, the rule activation level is 0.7.\n\n<<<0.7>>>"
