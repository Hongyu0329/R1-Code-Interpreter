    "When a standard origami crane is folded and then unfolded, the crease lines divide the square paper into a complex pattern of geometric shapes. After a careful analysis of the complete crease pattern, it has been determined that the paper is divided into 108 distinct regions.\n\nThe process of folding a crane involves a series of intricate steps, including the initial diagonal and horizontal folds to create a preliminary base, followed by petal folds and reverse folds to form the neck, tail, and wings. Each of these folds creates new lines on the paper. When unfolded, these lines intersect to form a specific and beautiful pattern. The final count of the regions is derived from systematically identifying and tallying each of these enclosed areas on the full crease pattern.\n\nA visual examination of the crease pattern reveals a symmetrical design, with a dense network of creases in the center of the paper, which corresponds to the body, neck, and tail of the crane, and fewer creases towards the edges, which form the wings.\n\n<<<108>>>"
