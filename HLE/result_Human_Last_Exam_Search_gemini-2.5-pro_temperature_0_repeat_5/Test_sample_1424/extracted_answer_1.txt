In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function G_0, in its momentum-frequency representation G_0(k, ω), is inversely proportional to the difference between the frequency ω and the single-particle energy eigenvalue ϵ_k. The functional form is typically expressed as G_0(k, ω) = 1 / (ω - ϵ_k + iδ), where iδ is an infinitesimal imaginary part that ensures causality.
