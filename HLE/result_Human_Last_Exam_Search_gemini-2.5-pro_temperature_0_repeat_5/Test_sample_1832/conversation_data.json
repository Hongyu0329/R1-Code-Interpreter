    "In the empty space outside a spherically symmetric gravitating body of mass $M$, the geometry of spacetime is described by the Schwarzschild metric. The Christoffel symbols, which are derived from the metric tensor, describe the gravitational field.\n\nFor the Schwarzschild metric, there are 9 distinct non-zero Christoffel symbols. These symbols are coefficients in the geodesic equations, which describe the motion of particles in the gravitational field. The non-zero Christoffel symbols are a consequence of the curvature of spacetime and the choice of a curvilinear coordinate system (spherical coordinates).\n\nThe 9 unique non-zero Christoffel symbols are:\n*   $\\Gamma_{tt}^r = \\frac{M(r-2M)}{r^3}$\n*   $\\Gamma_{rr}^r = -\\frac{M}{r(r-2M)}$\n*   $\\Gamma_{\\theta\\theta}^r = -(r-2M)$\n*   $\\Gamma_{\\phi\\phi}^r = -(r-2M)\\sin^2\\theta$\n*   $\\Gamma_{rt}^t = \\frac{M}{r(r-2M)}$\n*   $\\Gamma_{r\\theta}^\\theta = \\frac{1}{r}$\n*   $\\Gamma_{\\phi\\phi}^\\theta = -\\sin\\theta\\cos\\theta$\n*   $\\Gamma_{r\\phi}^\\phi = \\frac{1}{r}$\n*   $\\Gamma_{\\theta\\phi}^\\phi = \\cot\\theta$\n\nDue to the symmetry of the Christoffel symbols in their lower indices ($\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^\\rho = \\Gamma_{\\nu\\mu}^\\rho$), some of these represent more than one non-zero component. For instance, $\\Gamma_{rt}^t$ is equal to $\\Gamma_{tr}^t$. If all non-zero components are counted individually, the total number is 13. However, the standard practice is to count the number of unique, non-zero functions, which is 9.\n\n<<<9>>>"
