    "The Wittig reaction is a chemical process that converts aldehydes or ketones into alkenes. This is achieved by reacting the carbonyl compound with a phosphorus ylide, also known as a Wittig reagent. The reaction results in the exchange of the carbonyl oxygen atom with the carbon group from the ylide, forming a new carbon-carbon double bond at a precisely defined location.\n\nIn this specific reaction, the reactants are:\n*   **Pivalaldehyde** (also known as 2,2-dimethylpropanal), which is an aldehyde with the structure (CH₃)₃C-CHO.\n*   **The Wittig reagent**, (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ⁵-phosphane. This is a phosphorus ylide with the structure Ph₃P=CH-CH₂-(C₆H₄Cl).\n\nThe reaction proceeds as follows: the carbon-oxygen double bond of pivalaldehyde breaks and a new double bond forms between the aldehyde's carbon and the ylide's carbon. The oxygen atom from the pivalaldehyde binds to the triphenylphosphine part of the ylide, forming triphenylphosphine oxide (Ph₃P=O) as a byproduct.\n\nThe main organic product formed is an alkene. By connecting the tert-butyl group from the pivalaldehyde to the ethylidene chain from the ylide, the resulting structure is (CH₃)₃C-CH=CH-CH₂-(C₆H₄Cl).\n\nThe systematic IUPAC name for this product is **1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene**. Depending on the reaction conditions, this product can exist as a mixture of E and Z stereoisomers.\n\n<<<1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene>>>"
