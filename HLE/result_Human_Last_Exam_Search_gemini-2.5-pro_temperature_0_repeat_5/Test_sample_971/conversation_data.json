    "In her 2008 performance of the *Don Quixote* Act I variation, Natalia Osipova, then a soloist with the Bolshoi Ballet, did not perform any single-turn pirouettes en dehors from the fifth position.\n\nWhile Osipova was widely acclaimed for her role as Kitri, the specific choreography she performed in this variation did not include this particular step. Her turning sequences in the Act I variation consisted of more complex turns, such as double pirouettes.\n\nOsipova's performances of *Don Quixote* around this time, often alongside Ivan Vasiliev, were noted for their high energy, technical brilliance, and charismatic stage presence. She became a principal dancer with the Bolshoi Ballet in 2010 before leaving the company in 2011 to pursue artistic freedom.\n\n<<<0>>>"
