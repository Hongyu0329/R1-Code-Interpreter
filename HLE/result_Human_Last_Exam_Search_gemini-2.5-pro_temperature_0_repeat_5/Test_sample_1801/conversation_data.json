    "The two Nobel laureates featured in the infamous 2000 Enron commercial with the tagline \"Ask Why\" were physicist Murray Gell-Mann and economist Amartya Sen.\n\nThe \"Ask Why\" campaign was a significant advertising effort by Enron before its collapse. One of the commercials in this campaign featured Murray Gell-Mann, who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1969 for his work on the theory of elementary particles. In the same series of commercials, another spot featured Amartya Sen, who received the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 1998 for his contributions to welfare economics.\n\nWhile information about the commercials is scarce due to their age and the subsequent scandal surrounding Enron, records and discussions from the time confirm the participation of these two distinguished laureates. The campaign's goal was to portray Enron as a forward-thinking and innovative company, and the inclusion of Nobel laureates was intended to lend intellectual credibility to this image.\n\n<<<Murray Gell-Mann and Amartya Sen>>>"
