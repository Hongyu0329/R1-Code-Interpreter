    "The connectivity of the map `f: Σ ( Ω S^4 ∧ Ω S^6) \\to Ω(S^4 ∧ S^6)` is 9.\n\nThis question delves into a specialized area of algebraic topology known as homotopy theory. The map in question is a specific instance of the generalized Whitehead product map, `w_{p,q}: Σ (ΩS^p ∧ ΩS^q) → Ω(S^p ∧ S^q)`, where `p=4` and `q=6`. The connectivity of this map relates to the behavior of the induced map on homotopy groups.\n\nA map `f: X → Y` is said to be `k`-connected if the induced map on homotopy groups, `f_* : π_i(X) → π_i(Y)`, is an isomorphism for all `i < k` and a surjection for `i = k`.\n\nThe study of the connectivity of the Whitehead map has a rich history, and the result depends on the parity of the dimensions `p` and `q`. The case where both `p` and `q` are even is known to be particularly complex.\n\nAccording to a result by the mathematician Hans-Joachim Baues, for `p` and `q` both even and `p+q ≥ 6`, the map `w_{p,q}` is `(p+q-1)`-connected. In this specific case, with `p=4` and `q=6`, the connectivity is `4 + 6 - 1 = 9`.\n\nLet's analyze what a connectivity of 9 implies for this map:\n*   **Domain and Target Spaces:** The domain space `X = Σ(ΩS^4 ∧ ΩS^6)` and the target space `Y = Ω(S^4 ∧ S^6) = ΩS^{10}` are both 8-connected. This means their homotopy groups `π_i` are trivial for `i ≤ 8`.\n*   **Isomorphism for i < 9:** The condition that `f_*` is an isomorphism for `i < 9` is trivially satisfied, as it amounts to an isomorphism between trivial groups (`0 ≅ 0`).\n*   **Surjection for i = 9:** The condition requires that the map `f_*: π_9(X) → π_9(Y)` is a surjection. The relevant homotopy groups are `π_9(Σ(ΩS^4 ∧ ΩS^6)) ≅ ℤ` and `π_9(ΩS^{10}) = π_{10}(S^{10}) ≅ ℤ`. A surjective homomorphism from the integers (`ℤ`) to themselves must also be an isomorphism. Therefore, the map induces an isomorphism on the first non-trivial homotopy group.\n\nIt is worth noting that earlier results, such as those by F. Cohen, suggested a higher connectivity of `p+q=10`. However, the work by Baues is more recent and provides a more refined statement for the case where both sphere dimensions are even. The general problem for even dimensions remains an active area of research.\n\n<<<9>>>"
