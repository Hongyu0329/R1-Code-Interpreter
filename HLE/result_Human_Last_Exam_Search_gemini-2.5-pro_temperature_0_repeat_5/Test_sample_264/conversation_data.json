    "The search results confirm that for axis-aligned cubes, the intersection is also an axis-aligned rectangular prism (in this case, a cube). The volume can be found by determining the overlap on each axis. The core of the problem lies in interpreting the phrase \"shifted by 1/2 along the main diagonal\".\n\nLet's analyze the two interpretations again:\n\n**Interpretation 1: The components of the shift vector are (1/2, 1/2, 1/2).**\n*   Let the first cube (C1) be defined by the region 0 ≤ x ≤ 1, 0 ≤ y ≤ 1, and 0 ≤ z ≤ 1.\n*   The main diagonal can be represented by the vector starting from the origin (0,0,0) and ending at the opposite vertex (1,1,1).\n*   A shift \"along the main diagonal\" implies the shift vector is in the direction of (1,1,1).\n*   A shift \"by 1/2\" in this context suggests the components of the vector are each 1/2. So, the shift vector is (1/2, 1/2, 1/2).\n*   The second cube (C2) is then defined by the region 1/2 ≤ x ≤ 3/2, 1/2 ≤ y ≤ 3/2, and 1/2 ≤ z ≤ 3/2.\n*   The intersection of these two cubes is the region where both sets of inequalities hold true.\n    *   For the x-axis, the overlap is [1/2, 1].\n    *   For the y-axis, the overlap is [1/2, 1].\n    *   For the z-axis, the overlap is [1/2, 1].\n*   This intersection forms a smaller cube with a side length of 1 - 1/2 = 1/2.\n*   The volume of this intersection is (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/8.\n\n**Interpretation 2: The magnitude of the shift vector is 1/2.**\n*   The main diagonal of a unit cube has a length of √(1² + 1² + 1²) = √3.\n*   The direction of the main diagonal is given by the unit vector (1/√3, 1/√3, 1/√3).\n*   A shift of distance 1/2 in this direction results in a shift vector of (1/2) * (1/√3, 1/√3, 1/√3) = (1/(2√3), 1/(2√3), 1/(2√3)).\n*   Let s = 1/(2√3). The second cube (C2) is defined by s ≤ x ≤ 1+s, s ≤ y ≤ 1+s, and s ≤ z ≤ 1+s.\n*   The intersection with the first cube (C1:³) is the region [s, 1] x [s, 1] x [s, 1].\n*   The side length of this intersection cube is (1 - s) = (1 - 1/(2√3)).\n*   The volume would be (1 - 1/(2√3))³.\n\nThe phrasing \"shifted by [value] along [axis/direction]\" in coordinate geometry problems most commonly refers to the components of the displacement vector. For example, \"shifted by 5 along the x-axis\" means a shift vector of (5, 0, 0), not a shift of magnitude 5 along a potentially non-unit x-axis vector. Therefore, Interpretation 1 is the most direct and standard reading of the problem statement. The problem is designed to be straightforward if the setup is correct. The intersection of two axis-aligned cubes is found by finding the intersection of the intervals on each axis.\n\nLet's proceed with the first, more standard interpretation.\n\n1.  **Define the first cube (C1):** Let its coordinates be 0 ≤ x ≤ 1, 0 ≤ y ≤ 1, 0 ≤ z ≤ 1.\n2.  **Define the shift:** The main diagonal connects opposite vertices, for instance, (0,0,0) and (1,1,1). A shift of 1/2 along this diagonal corresponds to a displacement vector of (1/2, 1/2, 1/2).\n3.  **Define the second cube (C2):** Applying the shift to C1, the coordinates for C2 are 0 + 1/2 ≤ x ≤ 1 + 1/2, 0 + 1/2 ≤ y ≤ 1 + 1/2, and 0 + 1/2 ≤ z ≤ 1 + 1/2. This simplifies to 1/2 ≤ x ≤ 3/2, 1/2 ≤ y ≤ 3/2, and 1/2 ≤ z ≤ 3/2.\n4.  **Find the intersection:** The volume of intersection is a region where a point (x,y,z) belongs to both C1 and C2. This requires satisfying both sets of inequalities.\n    *   For x: max(0, 1/2) ≤ x ≤ min(1, 3/2)  =>  1/2 ≤ x ≤ 1\n    *   For y: max(0, 1/2) ≤ y ≤ min(1, 3/2)  =>  1/2 ≤ y ≤ 1\n    *   For z: max(0, 1/2) ≤ z ≤ min(1, 3/2)  =>  1/2 ≤ z ≤ 1\n5.  **Calculate the volume:** The intersection is a cube with a side length of (1 - 1/2) = 1/2. The volume is (1/2)³ = 1/8.\n\nThis result is clean and comes from a direct interpretation of the geometric language used.\n\nFinal check of the logic. The problem specifies two identical cubes. They are axis-aligned in their initial state. One is shifted relative to the other. Since the shift is along the main diagonal (1,1,1), the cubes remain axis-aligned. The calculation for the intersection of two axis-aligned boxes is straightforward and was performed correctly. The ambiguity of the phrasing is the main challenge, but the component-wise interpretation is the most standard one.\n\nFinal answer is 1/8.\n\n<<<1/8>>>"
