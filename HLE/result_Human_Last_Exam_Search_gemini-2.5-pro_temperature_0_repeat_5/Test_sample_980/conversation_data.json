    "This sequence does not follow a simple mathematical rule such as an arithmetic or geometric progression. The differences between consecutive numbers do not reveal a straightforward pattern. The numbers are not all prime, nor do they appear to be squares or cubes.\n\nHowever, a possible pattern emerges when analyzing the end of the sequence: ..., 10, 36, 36, 36, 124, 124, 124, 36, 124.\n\nThere is a clear repetition of numbers. We see a block of three 36s followed by a block of three 124s. After this, the sequence continues with a single 36 and a single 124. This suggests that the underlying pattern may involve repetitions of the numbers 36 and 124.\n\nOne interpretation is that the sequence is now alternating between 36 and 124. If this is the case, the next number would be 36.\n\nAnother interpretation is based on the common theme of repetition throughout the sequence. The last number is 124. It is plausible that this number repeats, as has happened with other numbers in the sequence (e.g., 67, 67, 67; 111, 111; 62, 62; 36, 36).\n\nConsidering the immediate preceding numbers, we have a block of three 124s, followed by a 36, and then a 124. A simple continuation of this pattern could be another 124, mirroring the earlier block of 124s.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, and the lack of a clear mathematical algorithm, the most reasonable guess is based on the most recent prominent feature, which is the repetition of the number 124.\n\n<<<124>>>"
