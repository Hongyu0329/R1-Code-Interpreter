    "The question asks for the minimal number of triangles needed for triangulating the outer-hull of the great icosahedron. This is equivalent to asking for the number of faces of the convex hull of the great icosahedron.\n\nBased on the search results, the convex hull of the great icosahedron is a regular icosahedron. A regular icosahedron is a Platonic solid with 20 faces, and these faces are equilateral triangles.\n\nTherefore, the outer hull of the great icosahedron is a regular icosahedron, which is already triangulated by its 20 triangular faces.\n\nThe minimal number of triangles needed for triangulating the outer-hull of the great icosahedron is 20.\n\n<<<20>>>"
