    "I am unable to provide a definitive count of the sissone fermes performed by Svetlana Zakharova in the Act II Odette variation of the 2014 Bolshoi Theatre's *Swan Lake* choreographed by Yuri Grigorovich.\n\nDespite extensive research for a video of the specified performance and detailed choreographic analyses, a source providing this exact number could not be located. Access to and analysis of the full performance video would be required to accurately count the steps. Reviews and discussions of the production focus on overall artistic interpretation and technical skill rather than a granular breakdown of the individual ballet steps.\n\n<<<I am unable to provide an answer.>>>"
