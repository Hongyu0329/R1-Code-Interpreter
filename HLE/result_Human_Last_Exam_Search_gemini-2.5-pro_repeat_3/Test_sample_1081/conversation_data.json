    "Let $G$ be a reductive group of type $E_8$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$. The number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of $G$ is given by a specific formula derived from the structure of the group.\n\nA key result in the theory of finite reductive groups states that the number of maximal tori defined over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ in a connected reductive group $G$ is the $p'$-part of the order of the group of its $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational points, $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$, where $p$ is the characteristic of $\\mathbb{F}_q$.\n\nFor a group of type $E_8$, the Dynkin diagram has no non-trivial automorphisms, which implies that the group is always split over any field, including $\\mathbb{F}_q$. Therefore, we consider the split Chevalley group of type $E_8$, denoted as $E_8(q)$.\n\nThe order of the finite group $E_8(q)$ is given by the formula:\n$$|E_8(q)| = q^{120} (q^2-1)(q^8-1)(q^{12}-1)(q^{14}-1)(q^{18}-1)(q^{20}-1)(q^{24}-1)(q^{30}-1)$$\nThe exponents in the formula (2, 8, 12, 14, 18, 20, 24, 30) are the degrees of the fundamental invariants of the Weyl group of type $E_8$. The term $q^{120}$ corresponds to the dimension of the unipotent radical of a Borel subgroup, where 120 is the number of positive roots in the $E_8$ root system.\n\nTo find the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori, we need to determine the $p'$-part of $|E_8(q)|$. Let $q=p^k$ for some prime $p$ and integer $k \\ge 1$. The term $q^{120}$ is a power of $p$. For each of the other factors, $(q^d-1)$, since $q$ is a power of $p$, $q^d$ is also a power of $p$. Therefore, $q^d-1$ is not divisible by $p$. Consequently, the product of all $(q^d-1)$ terms is the $p'$-part of the order of the group.\n\nThus, the exact number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of $G$ is the product of these factors.\n\n<<<$(q^2-1)(q^8-1)(q^{12}-1)(q^{14}-1)(q^{18}-1)(q^{20}-1)(q^{24}-1)(q^{30}-1)$>>>"
