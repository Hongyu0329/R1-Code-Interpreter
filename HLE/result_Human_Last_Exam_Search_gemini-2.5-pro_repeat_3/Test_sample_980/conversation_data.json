    "This sequence is derived from the Collatz conjecture, also known as the 3x + 1 problem, with a starting number of 27. The Collatz sequence is generated by repeatedly applying the following rules: if a number is even, the next number is half of it; if it's odd, the next is 3 times the number plus 1.\n\nThe number 111, which appears multiple times in the sequence, is the total number of steps it takes for the Collatz sequence starting from 27 to reach 1. Several other numbers in the provided sequence, such as 142, 41, 62, 155, 10, and 124, are terms that appear in the Collatz sequence for 27.\n\nThe sequence given is:\n111, 142, 111, 41, 67, 67, 67, 93, 111, 111, 62, 62, 111, 111, 36, 36, 49, 155, 49, 62, 49, 49, 62, 62, 10, 36, 36, 36, 124, 124, 124, 36, 124\n\nThe Collatz sequence for 27 includes the following subsequence: ..., 41, 124, 62, ... The provided sequence ends with the number 124. The next number in the Collatz sequence for 27 after 124 is 62. The other numbers in the sequence that are not part of the Collatz sequence for 27 (e.g., 67, 93, 36, 49) and the repetitions likely represent specific features or a form of encoding of the path of the Collatz sequence, but the underlying progression follows the Collatz sequence itself.\n\nTherefore, the next number in the sequence is the next term in the Collatz sequence for 27 after 124.\n\n<<<62>>>"
