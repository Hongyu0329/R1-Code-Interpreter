    "The probability that a particle in a one-dimensional box is located in a specific interval is found by integrating the probability density function, |ψ(x)|², over that interval.\n\nFor a particle in a 1D box of length 'a', the normalized wave function for the n-th energy level is given by:\n\nψn(x) = √(2/a) sin(nπx/a)\n\nIn this case, we are interested in the n=2 energy state. The wave function is:\n\nψ₂(x) = √(2/a) sin(2πx/a)\n\nThe probability density, |ψ₂(x)|², is therefore:\n\n|ψ₂(x)|² = (2/a) sin²(2πx/a)\n\nThe problem asks for the probability of finding the particle in the interval from x = 0.495a to x = 0.505a. This requires solving the following integral:\n\nP = ∫₀.₄₉₅ₐ⁰.₅₀₅ₐ (2/a) sin²(2πx/a) dx\n\nBecause the interval is very small and centered around the point x = 0.5a, we can use an approximation. For n=2, there is a node at the exact center of the box (x = 0.5a), meaning the probability of finding the particle at that precise point is zero. The probability of finding it in a small interval around this node, while small, is not zero.\n\nBy approximating the probability density function near the node and then integrating, we can find the probability. The result of this integration yields:\n\nP ≈ 6.58 x 10⁻⁶\n\nThis extremely low probability is expected because the interval is centered on a node of the n=2 wave function.\n\n<<<6.58e-6>>>"
