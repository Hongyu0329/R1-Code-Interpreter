    "An internal adjunction in the simplex category $\\Delta$, viewed as a locally posetal 2-subcategory of $\\mathsf{Pos}$, between objects $[m]$ and $[n]$ is a pair of order-preserving maps $f: [m] \\to [n]$ and $g: [n] \\to [m]$ that satisfy the conditions:\n1.  $f \\circ g \\le \\mathrm{id}_{[n]}$\n2.  $\\mathrm{id}_{[m]} \\le g \\circ f$\n\nHere, $[k]$ denotes the finite ordinal $\\{0, 1, \\dots, k\\}$, and for two maps $h_1, h_2: [a] \\to [b]$, the relation $h_1 \\le h_2$ means $h_1(x) \\le h_2(x)$ for all $x \\in [a]$. The triangle identities for adjunctions are automatically satisfied in a posetal 2-category, so these two inequalities are sufficient.\n\nSuch a pair of maps $(f, g)$ is what is known as a (monotone) Galois connection between the posets $[m]$ and $[n]$. An adjunction is uniquely determined by the choice of two subsets $A \\subseteq [m]$ and $B \\subseteq [n]$ that are isomorphic as posets, along with a specific isomorphism between them. Since any subset of a totally ordered set is also totally ordered (i.e., a chain), two such subsets are isomorphic if and only if they have the same size. Furthermore, for any two finite chains of the same size, there is a unique order-preserving isomorphism between them.\n\nThe maps $f$ and $g$ are determined by these subsets. Let $A \\subseteq [m]$ and $B \\subseteq [n]$ be subsets of the same size $k$, with $\\phi: A \\to B$ the unique order-isomorphism. The construction of $f$ and $g$ requires that for any element $i \\in [m]$, the set $\\{a \\in A \\mid i \\le a\\}$ is non-empty, and for any $j \\in [n]$, the set $\\{b \\in B \\mid b \\le j\\}$ is non-empty.\n*   The first condition implies that the maximum element of $[m]$, which is $m$, must be in $A$.\n*   The second condition implies that the minimum element of $[n]$, which is $0$, must be in $B$.\n\nThus, counting the number of internal adjunctions from $[m]$ to $[n]$ is equivalent to counting the number of pairs of subsets $(A, B)$ such that:\n*   $A \\subseteq [m] = \\{0, 1, \\dots, m\\}$ and $B \\subseteq [n] = \\{0, 1, \\dots, n\\}$.\n*   $|A| = |B|$.\n*   $m \\in A$.\n*   $0 \\in B$.\n\nIn this specific problem, we have $m=23$ and $n=37$. Let's count the number of such pairs of subsets.\n\nLet $k$ be the common size of the subsets $A$ and $B$.\n1.  **Choosing subset A**: We need to choose a subset $A \\subseteq$ of size $k$ that contains the element 23. This means we must choose the remaining $k-1$ elements from the set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 22\\}$, which has $23$ elements. The number of ways to do this is $\\binom{23}{k-1}$. For this to be possible, $0 \\le k-1 \\le 23$, which means $1 \\le k \\le 24$.\n\n2.  **Choosing subset B**: We need to choose a subset $B \\subseteq$ of size $k$ that contains the element 0. This means we must choose the remaining $k-1$ elements from the set $\\{1, 2, \\dots, 37\\}$, which has $37$ elements. The number of ways to do this is $\\binom{37}{k-1}$. For this to be possible, $0 \\le k-1 \\le 37$, which means $1 \\le k \\le 38$.\n\nTo find the total number of adjunctions, we must sum the product of these counts over all possible values of $k$. The common range for $k$ is $1 \\le k \\le 24$.\nTotal number of adjunctions = $\\sum_{k=1}^{24} \\binom{23}{k-1} \\binom{37}{k-1}$.\n\nLet $j = k-1$. The sum becomes:\nTotal = $\\sum_{j=0}^{23} \\binom{23}{j} \\binom{37}{j}$.\n\nThis sum can be calculated using a corollary of Vandermonde's Identity, which states $\\sum_{k} \\binom{r}{k}\\binom{s}{k} = \\binom{r+s}{r}$. This can be proven by comparing the coefficient of $x^r$ in $(1+x)^{r+s} = (1+x)^r (1+x)^s$. An alternative form of Vandermonde's identity is $\\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{r}{k}\\binom{m}{n-k} = \\binom{r+m}{n}$. Using the identity $\\binom{n}{k} = \\binom{n}{n-k}$, our sum becomes $\\sum_{j=0}^{23} \\binom{23}{j} \\binom{37}{37-j}$, which equals $\\binom{23+37}{37} = \\binom{60}{37}$.\n\nThe total number of internal adjunctions is therefore $\\binom{60}{37}$, which is also equal to $\\binom{60}{23}$.\n\n<<<$\\binom{60}{23}$>>>"
