    "I have conducted a thorough search for an island town that meets all three of your specific criteria and have concluded that no such place exists. The combination of extreme isolation, being situated on a bay formed by a volcanic caldera, and having the town and bay share the same name does not correspond to any known location.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the closest candidates and why they do not fully match your query:\n\n*   **Tristan da Cunha:** Its settlement, Edinburgh of the Seven Seas, is on the most remote inhabited island in the world, far exceeding the 500-kilometer isolation requirement. However, the town is situated on a coastal plain, not within a caldera bay, and its harbor is named Calshot Harbour, not Edinburgh of the Seven Seas.\n\n*   **Easter Island (Rapa Nui):** This island is also extremely isolated. Its main town, Hanga Roa, is named after the bay it sits on (\"Hanga Roa\" means \"long bay\"). While the island is volcanic, the bay of Hanga Roa itself is not a volcanic caldera.\n\n*   **Pitcairn Island:** This is another very remote inhabited island. Its only settlement, Adamstown, lies within a volcanic basin near Bounty Bay. It meets the isolation and arguably the caldera criteria, but the town and bay names are different.\n\n*   **Aogashima, Japan:** The village on this volcanic island is famously located inside a large crater. However, as part of the Izu Islands, it is not more than 500 kilometers from another inhabited island and the town does not share its name with a bay.\n\n*   **Santorini, Greece:** The towns here are famous for sitting on the rim of a spectacular caldera bay. However, the island is part of the Cyclades group and is close to many other inhabited islands, failing the isolation criterion.\n\nTherefore, based on available information, there is no island town that satisfies all the conditions of your question."
