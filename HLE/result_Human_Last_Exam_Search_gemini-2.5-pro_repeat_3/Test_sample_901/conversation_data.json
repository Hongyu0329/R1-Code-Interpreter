    "The reaction of (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane with potassium tert-butoxide (KOtBu) in tert-butyl alcohol is an E2 elimination reaction. The product of this reaction is **3-methylcyclohexene**.\n\nHere is a step-by-step explanation for this outcome:\n\n1.  **Reagents and Reaction Type**: The substrate is a secondary alkyl halide. Potassium tert-butoxide is a strong, sterically bulky base, and tert-butyl alcohol is a polar protic solvent. These conditions strongly favor an E2 (bimolecular elimination) reaction mechanism. Bulky bases like potassium tert-butoxide tend to form the less substituted alkene, known as the Hofmann product.\n\n2.  **Stereochemistry of the Substrate**: The starting material is (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane. This is a *trans* isomer. In substituted cyclohexanes, there is an equilibrium between two chair conformations. For a trans-1,2-disubstituted cyclohexane, the two conformations are one with both substituents in axial positions (diaxial) and one with both substituents in equatorial positions (diequatorial). The diequatorial conformation is significantly more stable because it minimizes steric strain.\n\n3.  **The E2 Elimination Requirement**: The E2 reaction has a strict stereochemical requirement: the hydrogen atom to be eliminated and the leaving group (bromine) must be in an anti-periplanar arrangement. In a cyclohexane ring, this means they must be in a trans-diaxial orientation (both in axial positions, one pointing up and one pointing down).\n\n4.  **Analysis of Conformations**:\n    *   **Stable Conformation (Diequatorial)**: In the more stable chair conformation of trans-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane, both the bromine and the methyl group are in equatorial positions. Since the bromine is not axial, an E2 reaction cannot occur from this conformation.\n    *   **Unstable Conformation (Diaxial)**: For the reaction to proceed, the molecule must flip to its less stable diaxial conformation, where both the bromine and the methyl group are in axial positions. Although this conformation is present in only a small amount at equilibrium, the reaction proceeds through it.\n\n5.  **Product Determination**: In the reactive diaxial conformation (let's assume axial-down bromine and axial-up methyl), we must look for an axial beta-hydrogen.\n    *   **Hydrogen at C2**: The carbon bearing the methyl group (C2) has only one hydrogen, and it is in an equatorial position. It is not anti-periplanar to the axial bromine, so elimination cannot occur here to form 1-methylcyclohexene (the Zaitsev product).\n    *   **Hydrogen at C6**: The other beta-carbon (C6) has an axial hydrogen that is anti-periplanar to the axial bromine. The bulky base, potassium tert-butoxide, can abstract this proton.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Elimination can only occur by removing a proton from C6. This stereochemical constraint forces the reaction to form the less substituted alkene.\n\nTherefore, due to the strict trans-diaxial requirement of the E2 mechanism, only one product can be formed. The reaction is forced to proceed through the less stable diaxial conformer and remove the only available anti-periplanar proton, which is on C6. This results in the exclusive formation of 3-methylcyclohexene, the Hofmann product. The use of a bulky base also favors this outcome.\n\n<<<3-methylcyclohexene>>>"
