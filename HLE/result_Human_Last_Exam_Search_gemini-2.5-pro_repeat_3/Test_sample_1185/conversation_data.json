    "The number of different types of stable reduction for curves of genus 2 is not a single, fixed number but depends on the level of detail and the context of the classification. The foundational work in this area was done by Namikawa and Ueno.\n\nA high-level classification based on the geometric structure of the reduced curve identifies seven main types:\n*   **Type I:** The stable reduction is a smooth genus 2 curve.\n*   **Type II:** The stable reduction is an elliptic curve with an ordinary double point.\n*   **Type III:** The stable reduction is a projective line with two ordinary double points.\n*   **Type IV:** The stable reduction consists of two projective lines that intersect transversally at three points.\n*   **Type V:** The stable reduction is the union of two elliptic curves intersecting transversally at a single point.\n*   **Type VI:** The stable reduction is composed of an elliptic curve and a projective line that has an ordinary double point, with the two components intersecting transversally at one point.\n*   **Type VII:** This type is similar to VI, but both the elliptic curve and the projective line components are singular.\n\nHowever, this is a simplified overview. The complete classification by Namikawa and Ueno is much more detailed, taking into account further invariants. This more detailed classification leads to a significantly larger number of types, with some sources indicating 104 families of reduction types for genus 2 curves.\n\nFurthermore, recent research has provided even more granular classifications, especially when considering specific arithmetic contexts. For example, the classification of the stable marked reduction of genus 2 hyperelliptic curves in residue characteristic 2 has identified 54 distinct types. This classification considers not just the geometric configuration but also additional arithmetic data.\n\nIn summary, while there are seven broad structural categories for the stable reduction of genus 2 curves, more detailed and technical classifications, such as the original one by Namikawa-Ueno and more modern refinements, identify a much larger number of types, ranging from 54 to 104, depending on the specific properties being classified.\n\n<<<There are at least seven broad structural types of stable reduction for curves of genus 2. However, more detailed classifications provide a much larger number of types, with the Namikawa-Ueno classification listing 104 families, and modern classifications in specific contexts, such as for marked hyperelliptic curves in residue characteristic 2, identifying 54 types.>>>"
