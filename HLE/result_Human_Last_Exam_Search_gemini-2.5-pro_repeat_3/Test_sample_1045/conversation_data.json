    "Toluene has the chemical formula C7H8. This means it has 7 carbon atoms and 8 hydrogen atoms.\n\nTo determine the total number of contracted Gaussian functions for toluene with a 6-31G basis set, we need to find the number of functions for each atom and then sum them up.\n\nFor the 6-31G basis set:\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** Each hydrogen atom is represented by 2 contracted Gaussian functions. This is a split-valence basis set where the 1s orbital is described by two functions, one composed of 3 primitive Gaussians and the other of 1 primitive Gaussian.\n*   **Carbon (C):** Each carbon atom is represented by 9 contracted Gaussian functions. The 1s core orbital is represented by one contracted function made of 6 primitive Gaussians. The valence orbitals (2s and 2p) are split. The inner part of the valence orbitals (2s and 2p) is described by a set of contracted functions (one s and one p) each composed of 3 primitive Gaussians. The outer part is described by another set of functions (one s and one p) each composed of 1 primitive Gaussian. So for the valence shell, there are 2 s-type and 2 p-type sets of functions. Since p orbitals have three components (px, py, pz), this results in 1 (for 1s) + 1 (for 2s inner) + 3 (for 2p inner) + 1 (for 2s outer) + 3 (for 2p outer) = 9 functions. However, a common practice in Pople-style basis sets is to use shared exponents for s and p functions in the valence shell, leading to a total of 1 (1s) + 4 (2sp inner) + 4 (2sp outer) = 9 contracted basis functions per carbon atom. Some sources might simplify this, but the total count of basis functions per atom remains consistent. For a carbon atom (and other second-row elements), the 6-31G basis set consists of 9 basis functions. For a hydrogen atom, it consists of 2 basis functions.\n\nCalculation for Toluene (C7H8):\n*   **Carbon atoms:** 7 atoms * 9 functions/atom = 63 functions\n*   **Hydrogen atoms:** 8 atoms * 2 functions/atom = 16 functions\n\nTotal number of contracted Gaussian functions:\n*   63 (from Carbon) + 16 (from Hydrogen) = 79 functions\n\nThus, for a 6-31G basis set calculation of toluene, 79 contracted Gaussian functions are used.\n\nThe explanation above shows the step-by-step derivation to reach the final answer.\nFirst, identify the number of each type of atom in the molecule.\nSecond, determine the number of contracted basis functions for each atom type according to the 6-31G basis set.\nThird, calculate the total number of basis functions for all atoms of each type.\nFinally, sum the totals to get the overall number of contracted Gaussian functions for the molecule.\n\nBased on this, the total number of contracted Gaussian functions is 79.\n<<<79>>>In a 6-31G basis set calculation of toluene (C7H8), a total of 92 contracted Gaussian functions are utilized.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the calculation:\n\n*   **Toluene's Chemical Formula:** Toluene has the chemical formula C7H8, which means it is composed of 7 carbon atoms and 8 hydrogen atoms.\n\n*   **Basis Functions for Carbon:** For each carbon atom, the 6-31G basis set uses 9 contracted Gaussian functions. This includes:\n    *   One function for the core (1s) orbital, which is a contraction of 6 primitive Gaussian functions.\n    *   For the valence shell (2s and 2p orbitals), it's a split-valence basis. There are two sets of functions. The inner set (describing the 2s and 2p orbitals) is a contraction of 3 primitive Gaussians, and the outer set is a single primitive Gaussian. This results in 1 (for 1s) + 4 (for the inner 2sp) + 4 (for the outer 2sp) = 9 functions per carbon atom.\n\n*   **Basis Functions for Hydrogen:** For each hydrogen atom, the 6-31G basis set uses 2 contracted Gaussian functions. The 1s orbital is represented by a split-valence set, with one function being a contraction of 3 primitive Gaussians and the other being a single primitive Gaussian.\n\n*   **Total Calculation:**\n    *   For the 7 carbon atoms: 7 atoms × 9 functions/atom = 63 functions\n    *   For the 8 hydrogen atoms: 8 atoms × 2 functions/atom = 16 functions\n    *   A calculation for a similar molecule, methanol (CH3OH), using the 6-31G basis set results in 26 basis functions (1 carbon x 9 + 4 hydrogens x 2 + 1 oxygen x 9, noting that oxygen also has 9 functions). A search result indicates that for a water molecule (H2O), the 6-31G** basis set, which is related, results in 25 basis functions.\n\nBased on the information for each atom, the total for toluene is:\n63 (from carbon) + 16 (from hydrogen) = 79 contracted Gaussian functions.\n\nHowever, a more precise count from computational chemistry resources indicates that for a carbon atom, the 6-31G basis set consists of 1 s-type function for the core, and for the valence shell, it has one s-type and one set of p-type functions (px, py, pz) from the 3-GTO contraction, and another s-type and another set of p-type functions from the 1-GTO part. This gives 1 (1s) + 1 (2s) + 3 (2p) + 1 (2s') + 3 (2p') = 9 functions is not quite right. The standard way Pople basis sets are constructed is that the s and p functions in the valence shell share exponents. This leads to a total of 1 (1s) + 4 (2sp) + 4 (2sp') = 9 functions per carbon atom. For Hydrogen, it is 2s functions. Therefore, the calculation is: 7 Carbons * 9 functions/Carbon + 8 Hydrogens * 2 functions/Hydrogen = 63 + 16 = 79 functions.\n\nA different interpretation exists where for Carbon, there is 1 core function (1s), and the valence is split into an inner shell (2s, 2px, 2py, 2pz) and an outer shell (2s', 2px', 2py', 2pz'). This would be 1+4+4 = 9 functions. For Hydrogen, the 1s is split into 1s and 1s', giving 2 functions. The calculation remains 7*9 + 8*2 = 79.\n\nLet's re-verify the number of functions. For a heavy atom like Carbon, there is one contracted function for the 1s core orbital. The valence 2s and 2p orbitals are each split into two contracted functions. This means 1 (for 1s) + 2 (for 2s) + 2*3 (for 2p) = 9 functions. For a Hydrogen atom, the 1s orbital is split into two contracted functions, so 2 functions.\n\nTherefore, the total number of contracted Gaussian functions is 7 * 9 + 8 * 2 = 63 + 16 = 79.\n\nUpon reviewing another source, for methanol (CH4O) with 6-31G, it's stated to have 26 basis functions. Let's apply our function counts: 1 Carbon (9) + 4 Hydrogens (2*4=8) + 1 Oxygen (9) = 26. This confirms that for second-row atoms (like C and O), the 6-31G basis set uses 9 contracted functions, and for hydrogen, it uses 2.\n\nThus, for toluene (C7H8), the total is indeed 7 * 9 + 8 * 2 = 79.\n\nThere appears to be a discrepancy in the initially stated answer. Let's recalculate and verify with the provided sources.\n\nThe molecular formula for toluene is C7H8.\nFor the 6-31G basis set:\n- Each Carbon (a second-row atom) has 9 basis functions.\n- Each Hydrogen has 2 basis functions.\n\nTotal functions = (Number of Carbon atoms × 9) + (Number of Hydrogen atoms × 2)\nTotal functions = (7 × 9) + (8 × 2)\nTotal functions = 63 + 16\nTotal functions = 79\n\nIt appears my initial direct answer of 92 was incorrect based on the detailed breakdown from the search results. The correct calculation based on the number of functions per atom is 79.\n\nFinal check of all sources. No source gives a direct answer for toluene. The method is consistent across multiple sources for other molecules. The number of functions for C and H are consistently given or can be inferred. The number of atoms in toluene is also clear. Therefore, the calculation of 79 is robust based on the provided search results.\n\n<<<79>>>"
