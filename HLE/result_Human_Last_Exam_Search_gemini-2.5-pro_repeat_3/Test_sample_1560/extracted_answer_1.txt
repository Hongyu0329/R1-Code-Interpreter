The final state of the system is probabilistic and depends on the measurement outcome. If ququint A is measured, the system will collapse into one of five possible states. The most probable outcome is a measurement of '2' on ququint A, occurring with a probability of 30%. In this case, the final state of the entangled system is $|2\rangle_A \otimes \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}(|0\rangle_B + |3\rangle_B + |4\rangle_B)$. The other four possible final states occur with probabilities of 20%, 20%, 20%, and 10%.
