    "To find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $N = 36036$ and order 6, we follow these steps:\n\n### 1. Factorize the conductor N\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of $N$:\n$N = 36036 = 36 \\times 1001 = (4 \\times 9) \\times (7 \\times 11 \\times 13) = 2^2 \\times 3^2 \\times 7^1 \\times 11^1 \\times 13^1$.\n\n### 2. Decompose the Dirichlet Character\nA Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $N$ is primitive if and only if it can be uniquely decomposed into a product of primitive Dirichlet characters modulo the prime power factors of $N$.\nLet $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\chi_3 \\chi_4 \\chi_5$, where:\n*   $\\chi_1$ is a primitive character modulo $4 = 2^2$.\n*   $\\chi_2$ is a primitive character modulo $9 = 3^2$.\n*   $\\chi_3$ is a primitive character modulo $7$.\n*   $\\chi_4$ is a primitive character modulo $11$.\n*   $\\chi_5$ is a primitive character modulo $13$.\n\nThe order of $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters:\n$\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_1), \\text{ord}(\\chi_2), \\text{ord}(\\chi_3), \\text{ord}(\\chi_4), \\text{ord}(\\chi_5))$.\nWe require this order to be 6.\n\n### 3. Analyze the Component Characters\nWe need to find the number of possible primitive characters for each prime power modulus and determine their orders.\n\n*   **Modulo 4 ($2^2$)**: The group of characters is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$, which has order $\\phi(4)=2$. There is one primitive character modulo 4, and its order is 2.\n\n*   **Modulo 9 ($3^2$)**: The group of characters is cyclic of order $\\phi(9)=6$. The characters that are not primitive are those induced from modulo 3, which have orders dividing $\\phi(3)=2$. The primitive characters are those with orders that do not divide 2, which are orders 3 and 6. The number of such characters is $\\phi(3) + \\phi(6) = 2 + 2 = 4$.\n\n*   **Modulo 7**: The group of characters is cyclic of order $\\phi(7)=6$. All non-principal characters are primitive. Their orders are the divisors of 6 other than 1, i.e., 2, 3, and 6. The number of such characters is $\\phi(2) + \\phi(3) + \\phi(6) = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5$.\n\n*   **Modulo 11**: The group of characters is cyclic of order $\\phi(11)=10$. The orders of primitive characters are divisors of 10 other than 1. We need the order to be a divisor of 6. The only common divisor is 2. The number of primitive characters of order 2 is $\\phi(2) = 1$.\n\n*   **Modulo 13**: The group of characters is cyclic of order $\\phi(13)=12$. The orders of primitive characters are divisors of 12 other than 1. We need the order to be a divisor of 6. The possible orders are 2, 3, and 6. The number of such characters is $\\phi(2) + \\phi(3) + \\phi(6) = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5$.\n\n### 4. Count the Number of Characters of Order 6\nLet $A(k)$ be the number of primitive characters of conductor $N$ and order $k$. Let $N(k)$ be the number of primitive characters of conductor $N$ whose order divides $k$. Using the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion (or Mobius inversion on the lattice of divisors of 6), we have:\n$A(6) = N(6) - N(3) - N(2) + N(1)$.\n\n*   **$N(k)$ Calculation**: The number $N(k)$ is the product of the number of choices for each component character $\\chi_i$ such that its order divides $k$.\n\n*   **$N(6)$**: The order of each component must divide 6.\n    *   $\\chi_1$ (mod 4): The primitive character has order 2, which divides 6. (1 choice)\n    *   $\\chi_2$ (mod 9): Primitive characters have orders 3 or 6, which divide 6. (4 choices)\n    *   $\\chi_3$ (mod 7): Primitive characters have orders 2, 3, or 6, which divide 6. (5 choices)\n    *   $\\chi_4$ (mod 11): The only primitive character with order dividing 6 has order 2. (1 choice)\n    *   $\\chi_5$ (mod 13): Primitive characters with orders dividing 6 can have orders 2, 3, or 6. (5 choices)\n    $N(6) = 1 \\times 4 \\times 5 \\times 1 \\times 5 = 100$.\n\n*   **$N(3)$**: The order of each component must divide 3.\n    *   $\\chi_1$ (mod 4): The primitive character has order 2, which does not divide 3. (0 choices)\n    Therefore, $N(3) = 0$.\n\n*   **$N(2)$**: The order of each component must divide 2.\n    *   $\\chi_2$ (mod 9): Primitive characters have orders 3 or 6, neither of which divides 2. (0 choices)\n    Therefore, $N(2) = 0$.\n\n*   **$N(1)$**: This is the number of primitive characters of order 1. The only character of order 1 is the principal character, which is only primitive for conductor $N=1$. Thus, $N(1) = 0$.\n\nSubstituting these values back into the formula for $A(6)$:\n$A(6) = 100 - 0 - 0 + 0 = 100$.\n\nThere are 100 primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor 36036 and order 6.\n\n"
