Within the theoretical framework of planar Birkhoff billiard dynamics, an asymptotic analysis of the generating function H(s,s′) that encapsulates the billiard map's symplectic structure reveals that the leading-order behavior of H(s,s′) in the limit as the arc-length parameter separation ∣s′−s∣ approaches zero is given by:

H(s,s′) ≈ -(s′−s) [1 + ⅛κ(s)²(s′−s)²]

Here, κ(s) represents the local curvature of the boundary at the point parameterized by s.

To derive this, we begin with the definition of the generating function, H(s,s′) = -||γ(s′) - γ(s)||, where γ(s) is the arc-length parameterization of the billiard boundary. A Taylor expansion of the position vector γ(s′) around s yields:
γ(s′) = γ(s) + (s′−s)γ′(s) + ½(s′−s)²γ′′(s) + O((s′−s)³)

According to the Frenet-Serret formulas for a plane curve, γ′(s) is the unit tangent vector T(s), and γ′′(s) = κ(s)N(s), where N(s) is the unit normal vector. The squared distance between the two points is:
||γ(s′)−γ(s)||² = ||(s′−s)T(s) + ½(s′−s)²κ(s)N(s) + ...||²

Expanding the dot product and using the orthogonality of T(s) and N(s) (T(s) · N(s) = 0), we get:
||γ(s′)−γ(s)||² = (s′−s)²||T(s)||² + ¼(s′−s)⁴κ(s)²||N(s)||² + ...
Since ||T(s)|| = 1 and ||N(s)|| = 1, this simplifies to:
||γ(s′)−γ(s)||² = (s′−s)² [1 + ¼κ(s)²(s′−s)² + ...]

Taking the square root to find the Euclidean distance gives:
||γ(s′)−γ(s)|| = |s′−s| [1 + ¼κ(s)²(s′−s)² + ...]^(½)

Using the binomial approximation (1+x)ⁿ ≈ 1+nx for small x, we expand the square root:
||γ(s′)−γ(s)|| ≈ |s′−s| [1 + ⅛κ(s)²(s′−s)²]

Assuming s′ > s without loss of generality, so |s'-s| = s'-s, the generating function H(s,s′) becomes:
H(s,s′) ≈ -(s′−s) [1 + ⅛κ(s)²(s′−s)²]

This expansion rigorously demonstrates that the local curvature κ(s) introduces a crucial cubic correction term to the generating function. This term, while small, is of fundamental importance as its derivatives determine the finer details of the billiard map for near-grazing trajectories, thereby directly linking the geometric properties of the boundary to the system's dynamical behavior in this asymptotic regime. The curvature dictates the deviation from the trivial "flat space" dynamics, influencing the stability of orbits and the emergence of chaotic or regular behavior.
