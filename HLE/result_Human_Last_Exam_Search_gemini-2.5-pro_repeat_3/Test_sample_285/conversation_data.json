    "To determine the largest $p$ such that the function $I$ is not in $L^p(\\mathbb{R}^9)$, we need to analyze the decay of the integral $I(\\mathbf{a})$ as $|\\mathbf{a}| \\to \\infty$. The $L^p$-integrability of $I(\\mathbf{a})$ is determined by the slowest possible decay rate.\n\nThe integral is given by\n$I(\\mathbf{a}) = \\int_{^2} e^{2\\pi i P(x, y)} dxdy$, where $\\mathbf{a} = (a_1, \\dots, a_9)$ and the phase is the polynomial $P(x, y) = \\sum_{j=1}^9 a_j \\phi_j(x, y)$ with $\\{\\phi_j\\}$ being the monomial basis $\\{x, y, x^2, xy, y^2, x^3, x^2y, xy^2, y^3\\}$.\n\nThis integral is the Fourier transform of a measure supported on the surface $S = \\{(\\phi_1(x,y), \\dots, \\phi_9(x,y)) \\mid (x,y) \\in^2\\}$ in $\\mathbb{R}^9$. The decay of such an integral is governed by the geometry of the surface, specifically by how \"flat\" the surface can be in certain directions. This corresponds to finding directions $\\mathbf{a}$ for which the phase polynomial $P(x,y)$ has highly degenerate critical points.\n\nThe decay rate of $I(\\mathbf{a})$ is not uniform over $\\mathbb{R}^9$. We must find the subspaces of $\\mathbf{a}$ that lead to the slowest decay and determine if these are significant enough to make the integral of $|I(\\mathbf{a})|^p$ over $\\mathbb{R}^9$ diverge.\n\nThe general method involves these steps:\n1.  Identify a subspace of parameters $\\mathbf{a}$ where the phase polynomial $P(x,y)$ is maximally degenerate. This happens when we can choose $\\mathbf{a}$ to make as many low-order terms of the Taylor series of $P(x,y)$ around a point $(x_0, y_0)$ vanish.\n2.  Determine the dimension, $k$, of this subspace and the decay rate, $|I(\\mathbf{a})| \\sim |\\mathbf{a}|^{-\\alpha}$, for $\\mathbf{a}$ in this subspace.\n3.  The integral $\\int_{\\mathbb{R}^9} |I(\\mathbf{a})|^p d\\mathbf{a}$ will diverge if the integral over a tubular neighborhood of this $k$-dimensional subspace diverges. This leads to the condition $p \\le k/\\alpha$.\n4.  We repeat this for different types of degeneracies and find the maximum value of $k/\\alpha$. This maximum value will give the threshold for $p$.\n\nLet's analyze the degeneracies. For simplicity, we consider the point $(x_0, y_0) = (0, 0)$.\nThe Taylor expansion of $P(x,y)$ at $(0,0)$ is simply the polynomial itself.\n- **Critical point at (0,0):** The gradient $\\nabla P(0,0)$ must be zero.\n  $\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial x}(0,0) = a_1 = 0$\n  $\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial y}(0,0) = a_2 = 0$\n- **Degenerate critical point at (0,0):** The Hessian matrix at (0,0) must be singular. To achieve higher degeneracy, we can make the entire Hessian vanish.\n  $\\frac{\\partial^2 P}{\\partial x^2}(0,0) = 2a_3 = 0 \\implies a_3=0$\n  $\\frac{\\partial^2 P}{\\partial y^2}(0,0) = 2a_5 = 0 \\implies a_5=0$\n  $\\frac{\\partial^2 P}{\\partial x \\partial y}(0,0) = a_4 = 0$\nThis leaves us with the subspace $V$ where $a_1=a_2=a_3=a_4=a_5=0$. This is a subspace of dimension $k=4$, with coordinates $(a_6, a_7, a_8, a_9)$. For $\\mathbf{a} \\in V$, the phase is a cubic form: $P(x,y) = a_6 x^3 + a_7 x^2 y + a_8 x y^2 + a_9 y^3$.\n\nNow we find the decay rate $\\alpha$ on this subspace $V$.\nFor a generic $\\mathbf{a} = (0,0,0,0,0, a_6, \\dots, a_9)$, the cubic form is non-degenerate.\nLet $\\mathbf{a} = r \\omega$ for $r > 0$ and $\\omega$ on the unit sphere in $V$.\n$I(r\\omega) = \\int_{^2} e^{2\\pi i r ( \\omega_6 x^3 + \\dots + \\omega_9 y^3)} dx dy$.\nUsing the scaling substitution $u=r^{1/3}x, v=r^{1/3}y$, the integral becomes:\n$I(r\\omega) = r^{-2/3} \\int_{[0,r^{1/3}]^2} e^{2\\pi i (\\omega_6 u^3 + \\dots + \\omega_9 v^3)} du dv$.\nAs $r \\to \\infty$, the integral converges to a constant (for generic $\\omega$). Thus, the decay rate is $|I(\\mathbf{a})| \\sim |\\mathbf{a}|^{-2/3}$. So, $\\alpha = 2/3$.\n\nFor this 4-dimensional subspace ($k=4$) with decay rate $\\alpha=2/3$, the condition for the divergence of $\\int |I|^p$ is $p \\le k/\\alpha = 4/(2/3) = 6$.\n\nWe should also check for special, more degenerate directions within this subspace $V$:\n*   Consider the line where only $a_6 \\ne 0$. The phase is $a_6 x^3$. The integral becomes $\\int_0^1 dy \\int_0^1 e^{2\\pi i a_6 x^3} dx = \\int_0^1 e^{2\\pi i a_6 x^3} dx$. By van der Corput's lemma, this decays as $|a_6|^{-1/3}$. Here we have a 1-dimensional subspace ($k=1$) with decay $\\alpha=1/3$. The condition for divergence is $p \\le k/\\alpha = 1/(1/3) = 3$.\n*   Consider the line where only $a_7 \\ne 0$. The phase is $a_7 x^2 y$. The integral is $I(a_7) = \\int_0^1 \\int_0^1 e^{2\\pi i a_7 x^2 y} dy dx$. The inner integral gives $\\frac{e^{2\\pi i a_7 x^2}-1}{2\\pi i a_7 x^2}$. The subsequent integral over $x$ yields a decay of $|a_7|^{-1/2}$. Here we have a 1-dimensional subspace ($k=1$) with decay $\\alpha=1/2$. The condition for divergence is $p \\le k/\\alpha = 1/(1/2) = 2$.\n*   Consider the plane where only $a_7, a_8 \\ne 0$. This is a 2D subspace ($k=2$) where the decay rate is generically $\\alpha=1/2$. This gives the condition $p \\le k/\\alpha = 2/(1/2)=4$.\n\nThe integral $\\int_{\\mathbb{R}^9} |I(\\mathbf{a})|^p d\\mathbf{a}$ diverges if the integral over a neighborhood of any of these subspaces diverges. This means the condition for divergence of the whole integral is the union of the individual conditions.\n$p \\le 3$ or $p \\le 4$ or $p \\le 6$.\nThis is equivalent to the single condition $p \\le 6$.\n\nThus, the integral $\\int_{\\mathbb{R}^9} |I(\\mathbf{a})|^p d\\mathbf{a}$ diverges for all $p \\le 6$. This means that $I$ is not in $L^p(\\mathbb{R}^9)$ for $p \\in (0, 6]$. The largest value of $p$ for which $I \\notin L^p$ is the supremum of this set, which is 6.\n\n"
