    "In a fuzzy logic system, the rule activation level is determined by applying a t-norm operation to the firing strength of the antecedent (the \"if\" part of the rule) and the membership degree of the consequent (the \"then\" part). The term `Phi_k(x′)` represents the firing strength of the rule's antecedent, and `μG_k_j(y_j)` is the membership degree of the rule's consequent.\n\nA t-norm, or triangular norm, is a function that models the logical \"AND\" operation in fuzzy logic. While several t-norms exist, the most common are the minimum t-norm and the product t-norm. In the absence of a specified t-norm, the minimum operator is often the default choice.\n\nThe level of activation for a rule is the result of the t-norm operation between the firing strength and the membership of the consequent.\n\nGiven the values:\n*   Firing strength `Phi_k(x′) = 0.7`\n*   Consequent membership degree `μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9`\n\nThe rule activation level is calculated as follows:\n\n*   **Using the Minimum t-norm:** `min(0.7, 0.9) = 0.7`\n*   **Using the Product t-norm:** `0.7 * 0.9 = 0.63`\n\nSince the problem does not specify which t-norm to use, and to provide a single value, the most standard interpretation uses the minimum t-norm.\n\nTherefore, the rule activation level is 0.7.\n\n<<<0.7>>>"
