    "### Small Molecules Targeting the SARS-CoV-2 Main Protease, the Same Target as CHEMBL4803817\n\nThe chemical compound represented by ChEMBL ID: CHEMBL4803817 is an inhibitor of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro), also known as 3C-like protease (3CLpro), which is cataloged in ChEMBL with the ID CHEMBL2364037. This enzyme is a critical component for the replication of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Therefore, other small molecules that interact with this same protein target are also inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease.\n\nA significant number of small molecules have been identified as inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease, and they can be broadly categorized as either covalent or non-covalent inhibitors.\n\n**Notable small molecule inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease include:**\n\n*   **PF-07321332 (Nirmatrelvir):** A key component of the antiviral drug Paxlovid, this is a potent inhibitor of the main protease.\n*   **Boceprevir and Telaprevir:** Originally developed as inhibitors for the hepatitis C serine protease, these have been found to be active against the SARS-CoV-2 main protease.\n*   **GC376:** A well-known covalent antiviral that serves as a positive control in many experimental assays for Mpro inhibition.\n*   **Ensitrelvir, Leritrelvir, and Simnotrelvir:** These are also authorized inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro.\n*   **Dipyridamole, Hydroxychloroquine, and Chloroquine:** Identified through virtual screening and confirmed by in vitro assays, these existing drugs have been shown to potently inhibit the main protease.\n*   **Candesartan:** This angiotensin II receptor blocker has also been identified as an inhibitor of the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro.\n*   **Cephalosporins (Cefadroxil and Cefoperazone) and Betrixaban:** These have been identified as potential repurposed antiviral compounds against the main protease.\n*   **HIV protease inhibitors (Lopinavir, Ritonavir, and Nelfinavir):** These have been investigated as non-covalent inhibitors of Mpro.\n\nIn summary, a diverse range of small molecules, from specifically designed antivirals to repurposed drugs, have been demonstrated to form protein-ligand interactions with the SARS-CoV-2 main protease, the same biological target as CHEMBL4803817."
