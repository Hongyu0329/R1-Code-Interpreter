    "The generalized quaternion group of size 128, denoted as Q_128, has 7 power subgroups.\n\nA power subgroup of a group G is a subgroup H that can be expressed as H = G^k = {g^k | g ∈ G} for some integer k. The generalized quaternion group Q_128 is defined by the presentation Q_128 = <x, y | x^64 = 1, x^32 = y^2, yxy⁻¹ = x⁻¹>.\n\nThe power subgroups of Q_128 are determined by the integer exponent k:\n\n*   **When k is an odd integer:** The mapping g → g^k is a bijection on the group, which means that G^k = G. This results in a single power subgroup, which is Q_128 itself.\n*   **When k is an even integer:** The set of k-th powers G^k forms a cyclic subgroup generated by x^k, which is G^k = <x^k>. The specific subgroup only depends on the greatest common divisor of k and 64. For even k, these gcds must be even divisors of 64.\n*   **When k=0:** The set of 0-th powers is the trivial subgroup containing only the identity element, {1}.\n\nThis leads to the following distinct power subgroups:\n1.  **Q_128**: The entire group (for any odd k).\n2.  **<x²>**: A cyclic subgroup of order 32 (for k=2, 6, 10, ...).\n3.  **<x⁴>**: A cyclic subgroup of order 16 (for k=4, 12, 20, ...).\n4.  **<x⁸>**: A cyclic subgroup of order 8 (for k=8, 24, 40, ...).\n5.  **<x¹⁶>**: A cyclic subgroup of order 4 (for k=16, 48, ...).\n6.  **<x³²>**: A cyclic subgroup of order 2 (for k=32). This is the center of the group, Z(Q_128).\n7.  **{1}**: The trivial subgroup (for k=64 or k=0).\n\nCounting these distinct subgroups gives a total of 7 power subgroups.\n\n<<<7>>>"
