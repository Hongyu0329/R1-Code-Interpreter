In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function \(G_0\) is inversely proportional to the difference between the frequency (\(\omega\) or energy) and the single-particle energy eigenvalues (\(\epsilon_k\)). The general form in frequency-momentum space is \(G_0(k, \omega) \propto \frac{1}{\omega - \epsilon_k}\), where an appropriate infinitesimal imaginary term is added to the denominator to handle the pole and enforce causality.
