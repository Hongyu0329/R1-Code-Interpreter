    "In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function \\(G_0\\) for a non-interacting system has a distinct functional dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalues \\(\\epsilon_k\\). This relationship arises from the fundamental structure of the path integral for a free theory.\n\nThe two-point Green's function is defined as the vacuum expectation value of the time-ordered product of field operators. In the path integral formalism, this is expressed as a functional integral over all possible field configurations:\n\n\\(G_0(x_1, x_2) = \\frac{\\int \\mathcal{D}\\phi \\, \\phi(x_1) \\phi(x_2) e^{iS_0[\\phi]}}{\\int \\mathcal{D}\\phi \\, e^{iS_0[\\phi]}}\\)\n\nHere, \\(S_0[\\phi]\\) is the action for a non-interacting (\"bare\") theory, which is quadratic in the field \\(\\phi\\).\n\nTo determine the functional dependence on the energy eigenvalues, it is most convenient to work in frequency-momentum space. The derivation involves the following key steps:\n\n1.  **Quadratic Action:** For a non-interacting system, the action \\(S_0\\) is quadratic. For a non-relativistic particle, after a Fourier transform to momentum space, the action can be written in a form involving an operator that is a function of frequency \\(\\omega\\) and momentum \\(k\\).\n\n2.  **Gaussian Integral:** The path integral with a quadratic action is a form of Gaussian integral. The result of such an integral for the two-point function is proportional to the inverse of the operator appearing in the quadratic part of the action.\n\n3.  **The Resulting Propagator:** Performing the path integral yields the bare propagator (or Green's function) in frequency-momentum space, \\(G_0(k, \\omega)\\).\n\nFor a system of non-interacting fermions, the bare Green's function in the frequency-momentum domain is found to be:\n\n\\(G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\delta \\cdot \\text{sgn}(\\epsilon_k - \\mu)}\\)\n\nwhere:\n*   \\(\\omega\\) is the frequency.\n*   \\(\\epsilon_k\\) represents the single-particle energy eigenvalues for a given momentum \\(k\\).\n*   \\(\\mu\\) is the chemical potential.\n*   \\(\\delta\\) is an infinitesimal positive number that ensures proper causal ordering by shifting the pole slightly off the real axis. The sign of the imaginary part depends on whether the state is occupied or unoccupied relative to the Fermi level.\n\nFor a free scalar field in quantum field theory, the expression is analogous:\n\n\\(G_0(p) = \\frac{i}{p^2 - m^2 + i\\epsilon} = \\frac{i}{(p_0)^2 - (\\vec{p}^2 + m^2) + i\\epsilon}\\)\n\nHere, \\(p = (p_0, \\vec{p})\\) is the four-momentum. The single-particle energy eigenvalues are given by \\(\\epsilon_{\\vec{p}} = \\sqrt{\\vec{p}^2 + m^2}\\), so the denominator has poles when the energy component \\(p_0\\) is equal to \\(\\pm \\epsilon_{\\vec{p}}\\).\n\nTherefore, the fundamental functional dependence of the bare Green's function \\(G_0\\) on the single-particle energy eigenvalues \\(\\epsilon_k\\) is that of an inverse, with poles occurring when the frequency or energy variable equals the single-particle energy eigenvalues.\n\n<<<In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function \\(G_0\\) is inversely proportional to the difference between the frequency (\\(\\omega\\) or energy) and the single-particle energy eigenvalues (\\(\\epsilon_k\\)). The general form in frequency-momentum space is \\(G_0(k, \\omega) \\propto \\frac{1}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k}\\), where an appropriate infinitesimal imaginary term is added to the denominator to handle the pole and enforce causality.>>>"
