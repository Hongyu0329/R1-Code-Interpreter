    "The connectivity of the map `f: Σ ( Ω S⁴ ∧ Ω S⁶ ) → Ω(S⁴ ∧ S⁶)` is 7.\n\nThis result is derived from the field of algebraic topology, specifically the study of homotopy theory. The argument proceeds as follows:\n\n1.  **Identifying the Map:** The map in question, `f: Σ ( Ω S⁴ ∧ Ω S⁶ ) → Ω(S⁴ ∧ S⁶)`, is best understood as the adjoint of a related map `h: Ω S⁴ ∧ Ω S⁶ → Ω(S⁴ ∧ S⁶)`. The space `S⁴ ∧ S⁶` is homotopy equivalent to the 10-sphere, `S¹⁰`, so the target space is `ΩS¹⁰`. The map `h` is constructed from two fundamental concepts in homotopy theory:\n    *   The **Samelson product** `S: Ω S⁴ ∧ Ω S⁶ → Ω(S⁴ ∨ S⁶)`, which arises from the commutator operation in the loop space `Ω(S⁴ ∨ S⁶)`.\n    *   The **pinch map** `q: S⁴ ∨ S⁶ → S⁴ ∧ S⁶ ≃ S¹⁰`, which collapses the wedge sum to the smash product.\n    The map `h` is the composition `(Ωq) ◦ S`.\n\n2.  **Connectivity of Maps:** The connectivity of a map is determined by the homotopy groups of its homotopy fiber. The connectivity of the original map `f` is related to the connectivity of its adjoint `h` by the formula: `conn(f) = conn(h) + 1`.\n\n3.  **Analyzing the Fiber of h:** To find the connectivity of `h`, we examine the long exact sequence of homotopy groups associated with its fiber, `F_h`.\n    `... → πᵢ₊₁(ΩS¹⁰) → πᵢ(F_h) → πᵢ(Ω S⁴ ∧ Ω S⁶) → πᵢ(ΩS¹⁰) → ...`\n\n4.  **Low-Dimensional Homotopy Groups:**\n    *   The source space `X = Ω S⁴ ∧ Ω S⁶` is 7-connected (its homotopy groups are trivial up to dimension 7).\n    *   The target space `Y = ΩS¹⁰` is 8-connected.\n\n5.  **Calculating the Connectivity:**\n    *   For `i ≤ 6`, all surrounding homotopy groups in the long exact sequence are trivial, which implies `πᵢ(F_h) = 0`. This shows that `conn(h) ≥ 6`.\n    *   For `i = 7`, the sequence becomes `... → π₈(Y) → π₇(F_h) → π₇(X) → ...`. Since `π₇(X) = 0`, `π₇(F_h)` is a quotient of `π₈(Y) = π₉(S¹⁰) ≅ ℤ`.\n    *   The map `π₈(X) → π₈(Y)` determines whether `π₇(F_h)` is trivial. This map on `π₈` is induced by the composition of the Samelson product and the pinch map, which corresponds to the suspended Whitehead product `E[id₄, id₆]` in `π₉(S¹⁰)`.\n    *   This Whitehead product represents an integer multiple of the generator of `π₉(S¹⁰) ≅ ℤ`, but it is not a generator itself (it is not `±1`). Classical results show this map is multiplication by an integer `k` where `|k| > 1`.\n    *   Because the map `h_*: π₈(X) → π₈(Y)` is not surjective, its cokernel is non-trivial (`ℤ/kℤ`). From the exact sequence, `π₇(F_h)` is isomorphic to this cokernel.\n    *   Since `π₇(F_h) ≠ 0`, the connectivity of `h` is exactly 6.\n\n6.  **Final Result:** With `conn(h) = 6`, the connectivity of the original map `f` is `conn(h) + 1 = 7`.\n\n<<<7>>>"
