    "To determine which ballet step ends in the same leg position as it starts, each step must be analyzed from its beginning to its end.\n\n*   **A. Entrechat six:** An entrechat is a jump in which the dancer's legs interweave in the air. For even-numbered entrechats (deux, quatre, six), the dancer starts in fifth position and lands on two feet in the same fifth position they started in. For an entrechat six, there are six movements in total, with the legs beating three times, but the feet return to their original configuration.\n\n*   **B. Échappé battu changé:** *Échappé* means \"escaped\" and involves a jump from a closed position (like fifth) to an open one (like second), and back to a closed position. *Battu* means the step is \"beaten,\" and *changé* explicitly means the feet \"change\" positions. Therefore, a dancer starting with the right foot in front will finish with the left foot in front.\n\n*   **C. Assemblé:** This step means \"to assemble.\" A dancer typically starts on one foot, brushes the other leg out, and then jumps, \"assembling\" the legs in the air to land on both feet simultaneously in fifth position. Because it starts on one leg and lands on two, the start and end positions are different.\n\n*   **D. Glissade derrière:** *Glissade* means \"to glide.\" In a *glissade derrière* (gliding behind), a dancer starting in fifth position with one foot in front will end up changing feet. While some forms of glissade, like *glissade devant*, can finish in the starting position, *glissade derrière* typically involves a change.\n\n*   **E. Gargouillade:** This is an embellished *pas de chat* that involves a rond de jambe (circular movement of the leg) with each leg while jumping. The step generally starts in fifth position and ends in fifth position, but with the feet having switched places.\n\nBased on these definitions, the only step listed that concludes in the exact same starting leg position is the Entrechat six.\n\n<<<A>>>"
