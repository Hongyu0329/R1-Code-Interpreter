    "True.\n\nThe predictive ability of a polygenic score (PGS), measured by the proportion of variance it explains (R²), is necessarily lower than the SNP heritability (h²_SNP) of a trait under typical conditions.\n\nHere's the breakdown of why this is the case:\n*   **SNP Heritability (h²_SNP):** This is a theoretical measure that quantifies the total proportion of phenotypic variation in a population that can be attributed to all the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) considered together. It represents the *theoretical upper limit* or ceiling for how much of a trait's variance can be predicted using only SNP data.\n\n*   **Polygenic Score (PGS) R²:** A PGS is a practical tool. It is a single score calculated for an individual by adding up the effects of many genetic variants (SNPs). The effect of each SNP is estimated from a large-scale genetic study called a Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS). The predictive power of this score is then tested in an independent group of people and measured by R², the percentage of variance in the trait that the score can predict.\n\nThe PGS R² is nearly always lower than h²_SNP for several key reasons:\n*   **Estimation Error:** The SNP effects used to build a PGS are derived from a GWAS with a finite sample size. This means the effect sizes are not known perfectly and contain statistical noise or error. Only a GWAS with an infinite sample size could theoretically estimate the effects without error.\n*   **Methodological Limitations:** The statistical methods used to create a PGS, such as selecting which SNPs to include and how to weight them, have their own limitations and may not perfectly capture the true genetic architecture of the trait.\n*   **\"Missing Heritability\":** Current PGS models, even when based on very large studies, do not yet capture the full SNP heritability. This gap is often referred to as \"missing heritability.\"\n\nIn essence, SNP heritability is the theoretical maximum predictive power, while a PGS is a real-world, imperfect attempt to achieve that prediction. Therefore, its predictive power (R²) will be lower than this theoretical maximum. While some research has explored specific, complex scenarios (like unaccounted for heterogeneity between study cohorts) where R² could mathematically exceed an estimated h²_SNP, these are exceptions to the generally accepted rule.\n\n<<<True>>>"
