    "While John Milton's epic poem *Paradise Lost* is deeply rooted in Christian theology, it does not mention a large number of historical saints by name. The narrative focuses primarily on the biblical story of the Fall of Man, featuring characters from the Book of Genesis and the celestial hierarchy.\n\nThe most prominent figures who could be considered \"saints\" in a broader sense and are named in the poem are the archangels. In particular, **Michael** and **Raphael** have significant roles. Michael leads the heavenly army against Satan and later reveals the future of mankind to Adam. Raphael acts as a divine messenger, warning Adam and Eve of the impending danger. The archangels **Gabriel** and **Uriel** also appear by name. While these are angelic beings and not historical human saints, Michael is referred to as a saint in some Christian traditions.\n\nIn the later books of the poem, as the Archangel Michael recounts future biblical history to Adam, several key figures from the Old Testament are named. These include **Enoch**, described as \"the only righteous in a World perverse\" whom God took to be with him. Also mentioned are **Abraham**, **Moses**, **Joshua** (whom Michael notes is called \"Jesus\" by the Gentiles), and **David**.\n\nThe term \"saints\" is used more generally within the poem to refer to the host of angels who remained loyal to God. However, in terms of named historical individuals who are venerated as saints in Christian tradition, the number is very limited.\n\nTherefore, counting the named archangels with saintly status and the mentioned Old Testament figures revered as saints, there are a handful of such individuals named. However, if the query is strictly limited to canonized historical saints post-Christ, none are mentioned by name.\n\n<<<6>>>"
