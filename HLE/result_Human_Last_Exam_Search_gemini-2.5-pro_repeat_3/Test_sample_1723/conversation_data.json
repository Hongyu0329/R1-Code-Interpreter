    "While many mushrooms exhibit a blue coloration on their caps or stems, and some even bruise blue when handled, there is no known genus of mushroom that produces a distinctly blue spore print. Spore prints are a crucial tool for mushroom identification, and their colors are typically in shades of white, cream, pink, brown, black, and occasionally green or orange.\n\nSeveral well-known blue-colored mushrooms have spore prints of other colors. For instance, the striking *Lactarius indigo* has a cream-colored spore print. Another vividly blue mushroom, *Entoloma hochstetteri*, a native of New Zealand, is known for its pink spore print.\n\nThe genus *Stropharia* includes species like the Blue Roundhead (*Stropharia caerulea*), which, despite its name, has a purple-brown to purple-black spore print. Similarly, some species within the large genus *Cortinarius* have blue caps but are characterized by their rusty-brown spore prints.\n\nMushrooms in the genera *Panaeolus* and *Psilocybe* are famous for their blue-bruising reaction, but this is a chemical change in the mushroom's flesh and not related to the spore color. *Panaeolus cyanescens*, for example, has a black spore print, while *Psilocybe cyanescens* produces a dark purplish-brown spore print.\n\nTherefore, the characteristic of a blue spore print is not known to exist in the fungal kingdom.\n\n<<<There is no known mushroom genus that produces a distinctly blue spore print.>>>"
