    "In finite-temperature field theory, the partition function for a neutral scalar field `ϕ` is given by a functional integral over all field configurations that are periodic in imaginary time with a period `β = 1/T`, where `T` is the temperature. The expression is:\n\n`Z = ∫ Dϕ exp(-S_E[ϕ])`\n\nHere, `S_E[ϕ]` is the Euclidean action for the scalar field. For a free, neutral scalar field with mass `m`, the Euclidean action in `d+1` dimensions (d spatial dimensions and one imaginary time dimension) is:\n\n`S_E[ϕ] = ∫_0^β dτ ∫ d^d x [ 1/2 (∂_τ ϕ)^2 + 1/2 (∇ϕ)^2 + 1/2 m^2 ϕ^2 ]`\n\nThis action can be written in a more compact form using a quadratic operator `D_ϕ`. To do this, we can perform an integration by parts on the kinetic terms. Assuming the fields vanish at spatial infinity and are periodic in the imaginary time `τ`, the boundary terms vanish. This gives:\n\n`S_E[ϕ] = 1/2 ∫_0^β dτ ∫ d^d x ϕ(-∂_τ^2 - ∇^2 + m^2)ϕ`\n\nThe inner product of two real functions `f(x)` and `g(x)` over a given domain is generally defined as `(f, g) = ∫ dx f(x)g(x)`. In the context of the functional integral for a scalar field at finite temperature, the fields `ϕ(τ, x)` are real functions on the Euclidean spacetime `[0, β] × R^d`. The inner product is therefore defined as an integral over this spacetime:\n\n`(f, g) = ∫_0^β dτ ∫ d^d x f(τ, x) g(τ, x)`\n\nUsing this definition, the quadratic part of the action can be expressed as `1/2 (ϕ, D_ϕ)`.\n\nTherefore, the inner product `(ϕ, D_ϕ)` in the functional integral representation of the partition function for a neutral scalar field at finite temperature is:\n\n` (ϕ, D_ϕ) = ∫_0^β dτ ∫ d^d x ϕ(τ, x) (-∂_τ^2 - ∇^2 + m^2) ϕ(τ, x) `\n\nHere, `τ` is the imaginary time coordinate, `x` represents the spatial coordinates, `∇^2` is the spatial Laplacian, and `m` is the mass of the scalar field. The operator `D_ϕ = -∂_τ^2 - ∇^2 + m^2` is the differential operator that governs the dynamics of the free scalar field in Euclidean spacetime.\n\n<<<In finite-temperature field theory, for a neutral scalar field `ϕ`, the inner product `(ϕ, D_ϕ)` in the functional integral representation of the partition function is given by:\n\n`(ϕ, D_ϕ) = ∫_0^β dτ ∫ d^d x ϕ(τ, x) (-∂_τ^2 - ∇^2 + m^2) ϕ(τ, x)`\n\nwhere:\n*   `ϕ(τ, x)` is the neutral scalar field, which is a function of imaginary time `τ` and spatial coordinates `x`.\n*   The integration is over imaginary time `τ` from 0 to `β = 1/T` (where `T` is the temperature) and over all spatial dimensions `d`.\n*   `D_ϕ = -∂_τ^2 - ∇^2 + m^2` is the differential operator acting on the field `ϕ`.\n*   `∂_τ^2` is the second partial derivative with respect to imaginary time.\n*   `∇^2` is the Laplacian operator with respect to the spatial coordinates.\n*   `m` is the mass of the scalar field.\n\nThis inner product represents the quadratic part of the Euclidean action for the free neutral scalar field in the path integral formulation of the partition function.>>>"
