In finite-temperature field theory, for a neutral scalar field `ϕ`, the inner product `(ϕ, D_ϕ)` in the functional integral representation of the partition function is given by:

`(ϕ, D_ϕ) = ∫_0^β dτ ∫ d^d x ϕ(τ, x) (-∂_τ^2 - ∇^2 + m^2) ϕ(τ, x)`

where:
*   `ϕ(τ, x)` is the neutral scalar field, which is a function of imaginary time `τ` and spatial coordinates `x`.
*   The integration is over imaginary time `τ` from 0 to `β = 1/T` (where `T` is the temperature) and over all spatial dimensions `d`.
*   `D_ϕ = -∂_τ^2 - ∇^2 + m^2` is the differential operator acting on the field `ϕ`.
*   `∂_τ^2` is the second partial derivative with respect to imaginary time.
*   `∇^2` is the Laplacian operator with respect to the spatial coordinates.
*   `m` is the mass of the scalar field.

This inner product represents the quadratic part of the Euclidean action for the free neutral scalar field in the path integral formulation of the partition function.
