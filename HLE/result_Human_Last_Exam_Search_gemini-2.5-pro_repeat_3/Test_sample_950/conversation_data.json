    "The rank of the torsion subgroup of the integral cohomology ring of the space of $3$-subspaces of $\\mathbb{R}^5$ is 3.\n\n### Detailed Explanation\n\nThe space of $3$-subspaces of $\\mathbb{R}^5$ is the real Grassmannian manifold, denoted as $G(3, 5)$ or $Gr_3(\\mathbb{R}^5)$. The integral cohomology ring is the direct sum of its cohomology groups, $H^*(G(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z}) = \\bigoplus_{k \\ge 0} H^k(G(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\n**1. Interpretation of the Question:**\nThe \"rank\" of a torsion group (a group where every element has finite order) is, by definition, zero. However, in the context of algebraic topology, the torsion subgroup of the integral cohomology of a real Grassmannian is known to be an elementary abelian 2-group, which is a direct sum of copies of $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$. The question is most likely asking for the number of these $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$ summands, which is the dimension of the torsion subgroup considered as a vector space over the field of two elements, $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n**2. Cohomology of G(3, 5):**\nThe Grassmannian $G(3, 5)$ is diffeomorphic to $G(2, 5)$ by taking the orthogonal complement of the subspaces. The integral cohomology groups of $G(2, 5)$ have been computed. According to multiple sources, including a result by TerziÄ‡ cited by Akbari and Zare, the integral cohomology groups of $G(2, 5)$ are as follows:\n*   $H^0(G(2, 5); \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}$\n*   $H^1(G(2, 5); \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$\n*   $H^2(G(2, 5); \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$\n*   $H^3(G(2, 5); \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$\n*   $H^4(G(2, 5); \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}$\n*   $H^5(G(2, 5); \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$\n*   $H^6(G(2, 5); \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$\n*   $H^k(G(2, 5); \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$ for $k > 6$.\n\n**3. Torsion Subgroup Calculation:**\nThe torsion subgroup of the entire cohomology ring is the direct sum of the torsion subgroups of each cohomology group. The torsion subgroup of an abelian group consists of all elements of finite order.\n*   $Tors(H^0) = \\{0\\}$\n*   $Tors(H^1) = \\{0\\}$\n*   $Tors(H^2) = \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$\n*   $Tors(H^3) = \\{0\\}$\n*   $Tors(H^4) = \\{0\\}$\n*   $Tors(H^5) = \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$\n*   $Tors(H^6) = \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$\n\nSumming these up, the total torsion subgroup of the integral cohomology ring is:\n$T = Tors(H^2) \\oplus Tors(H^5) \\oplus Tors(H^6) = \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\cong (\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^3$.\n\n**4. Final Answer:**\nThis torsion subgroup is a direct sum of three copies of $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$. Therefore, the number of summands, or its dimension as a vector space over $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$, is 3.\n\n<<<3>>>"
