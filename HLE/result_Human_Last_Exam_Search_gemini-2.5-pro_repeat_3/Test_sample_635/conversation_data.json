    "To find a left coprime factorization of the transfer function\n\\[\nH(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{s-1}{s+1} & 1 \\\\ \\frac{2}{s^2-1} & 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nwe are looking for two polynomial matrices, $D(s)$ and $N(s)$, such that $H(s) = D^{-1}(s) N(s)$ and they are left coprime.\n\nThe relation $H(s) = D^{-1}(s) N(s)$ is equivalent to $D(s) H(s) = N(s)$. Let the polynomial matrices $D(s)$ and $N(s)$ be:\n\\[\nD(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} d_{11}(s) & d_{12}(s) \\\\ d_{21}(s) & d_{22}(s) \\end{bmatrix}, \\quad N(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} n_{11}(s) & n_{12}(s) \\\\ n_{21}(s) & n_{22}(s) \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nThe equation $D(s)H(s) = N(s)$ becomes:\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix} d_{11}(s) & d_{12}(s) \\\\ d_{21}(s) & d_{22}(s) \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{s-1}{s+1} & 1 \\\\ \\frac{2}{s^2-1} & 0 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} n_{11}(s) & n_{12}(s) \\\\ n_{21}(s) & n_{22}(s) \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nMultiplying the matrices on the left side gives:\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix} d_{11}(s)\\frac{s-1}{s+1} + d_{12}(s)\\frac{2}{s^2-1} & d_{11}(s) \\\\ d_{21}(s)\\frac{s-1}{s+1} + d_{22}(s)\\frac{2}{s^2-1} & d_{21}(s) \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} n_{11}(s) & n_{12}(s) \\\\ n_{21}(s) & n_{22}(s) \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nFor $N(s)$ to be a polynomial matrix, all its elements must be polynomials.\nFrom the second column, we see that $n_{12}(s) = d_{11}(s)$ and $n_{22}(s) = d_{21}(s)$. This implies that $d_{11}(s)$ and $d_{21}(s)$ must be polynomials.\n\nFrom the first column, the following expressions must be polynomials:\n1.  $n_{11}(s) = \\frac{d_{11}(s)(s-1)^2 + 2d_{12}(s)}{(s-1)(s+1)}$\n2.  $n_{21}(s) = \\frac{d_{21}(s)(s-1)^2 + 2d_{22}(s)}{(s-1)(s+1)}$\n\nFor these expressions to be polynomials, the numerators must be divisible by the denominator $(s-1)(s+1)$. This implies the numerators must be zero at $s=1$ and $s=-1$.\n\nFor the first numerator:\n-   At $s=1$: $d_{11}(1)(1-1)^2 + 2d_{12}(1) = 0 \\implies 2d_{12}(1) = 0 \\implies d_{12}(1)=0$. So, $(s-1)$ must be a factor of $d_{12}(s)$.\n-   At $s=-1$: $d_{11}(-1)(-1-1)^2 + 2d_{12}(-1) = 0 \\implies 4d_{11}(-1) + 2d_{12}(-1) = 0 \\implies 2d_{11}(-1) + d_{12}(-1) = 0$.\n\nFor the second numerator:\n-   At $s=1$: $d_{21}(1)(1-1)^2 + 2d_{22}(1) = 0 \\implies 2d_{22}(1) = 0 \\implies d_{22}(1)=0$. So, $(s-1)$ must be a factor of $d_{22}(s)$.\n-   At $s=-1$: $d_{21}(-1)(-1-1)^2 + 2d_{22}(-1) = 0 \\implies 4d_{21}(-1) + 2d_{22}(-1) = 0 \\implies 2d_{21}(-1) + d_{22}(-1) = 0$.\n\nWe need to find the simplest polynomial solutions for $d_{ij}(s)$ that satisfy these conditions and also result in a non-singular $D(s)$.\n\nLet's construct the first row of $D(s)$. Let's try simple polynomials. Let $d_{11}(s) = 1$. From $2d_{11}(-1) + d_{12}(-1) = 0$, we get $2(1) + d_{12}(-1) = 0 \\implies d_{12}(-1) = -2$. Also, $d_{12}(s)$ must have a factor of $(s-1)$. Let's try the simplest form for $d_{12}(s)$ that satisfies these conditions: $d_{12}(s) = c(s-1)$. At $s=-1$, we have $c(-1-1) = -2c = -2$, so $c=1$. This gives $d_{12}(s) = s-1$.\nWith $d_{11}(s)=1$ and $d_{12}(s)=s-1$, we find the first row of $N(s)$:\n$n_{12}(s) = d_{11}(s) = 1$.\n$n_{11}(s) = \\frac{1 \\cdot (s-1)^2 + 2(s-1)}{(s-1)(s+1)} = \\frac{(s-1)(s-1+2)}{(s-1)(s+1)} = \\frac{s+1}{s+1} = 1$.\nSo, the first row of $D(s)$ is $\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & s-1 \\end{bmatrix}$ and the first row of $N(s)$ is $\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}$.\n\nNow let's construct the second row of $D(s)$. We need $d_{22}(1)=0$, so let $d_{22}(s) = c'(s-1)$. The condition $2d_{21}(-1) + d_{22}(-1) = 0$ becomes $2d_{21}(-1) + c'(-2) = 0 \\implies d_{21}(-1) = c'$.\nWe must choose $d_{21}(s)$ and $c'$ so that $\\det(D(s)) \\neq 0$.\n$\\det(D(s)) = d_{11}d_{22} - d_{12}d_{21} = 1 \\cdot c'(s-1) - (s-1)d_{21}(s) = (s-1)(c' - d_{21}(s))$.\nIf we choose $d_{21}(s)$ to be a constant, say $k$, then $k = c'$, which makes $\\det(D(s))=0$. So, $d_{21}(s)$ must be a polynomial of degree at least 1. Let's try $d_{21}(s) = as+b$.\nThe condition $d_{21}(-1)=c'$ gives $-a+b=c'$.\nLet's choose $a=1$ and $c'=1$. Then $-1+b=1 \\implies b=2$. So $d_{21}(s) = s+2$.\nThis gives $d_{22}(s) = 1 \\cdot (s-1) = s-1$.\nWith $d_{21}(s)=s+2$ and $d_{22}(s)=s-1$, we find the second row of $N(s)$:\n$n_{22}(s) = d_{21}(s) = s+2$.\n$n_{21}(s) = \\frac{(s+2)(s-1)^2 + 2(s-1)}{(s-1)(s+1)} = \\frac{(s-1)[(s+2)(s-1)+2]}{(s-1)(s+1)} = \\frac{s^2+s-2+2}{s+1} = \\frac{s(s+1)}{s+1} = s$.\nSo, the second row of $D(s)$ is $\\begin{bmatrix} s+2 & s-1 \\end{bmatrix}$ and the second row of $N(s)$ is $\\begin{bmatrix} s & s+2 \\end{bmatrix}$.\n\nThus, we have a candidate factorization:\n\\[\nD(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & s-1 \\\\ s+2 & s-1 \\end{bmatrix}, \\quad N(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ s & s+2 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nWe check the determinant of $D(s)$:\n$\\det(D(s)) = 1(s-1) - (s-1)(s+2) = (s-1)(1 - (s+2)) = (s-1)(-s-1) = -(s^2-1) = 1-s^2$.\nSince the determinant is not zero, $D^{-1}(s)$ exists.\n\nFinally, we must check for left coprimeness. The matrices $D(s)$ and $N(s)$ are left coprime if the matrix $[D(s) \\quad N(s)]$ has full row rank (rank 2) for all complex numbers $s$.\n\\[\n[D(s) \\quad N(s)] = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & s-1 & 1 & 1 \\\\ s+2 & s-1 & s & s+2 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nThe rank can drop below 2 only if the two rows are linearly dependent for some value of $s$. The rank drops if one row is a multiple of the other. Let's check for which $s$ the second row could be a multiple of the first. This would require $s+2 = k\\cdot1$, $s-1=k(s-1)$, $s=k\\cdot1$, and $s+2=k\\cdot1$.\nFrom $s-1=k(s-1)$, we get $k=1$ for $s \\neq 1$.\nSubstituting $k=1$ into the other equations gives $s+2=1 \\implies s=-1$ and $s=1$. These are contradictory. Thus, the rows are linearly independent for all $s$ except possibly at $s=1$.\nWe check the problematic points, which are the roots of $\\det(D(s))$, i.e., $s=1$ and $s=-1$.\n-   At $s=1$: $[D(1) \\quad N(1)] = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\\\ 3 & 0 & 1 & 3 \\end{bmatrix}$. This matrix has rank 2 (e.g., the submatrix from columns 1 and 3 has determinant $1-3=-2 \\neq 0$).\n-   At $s=-1$: $[D(-1) \\quad N(-1)] = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & -2 & 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & -2 & -1 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}$. This matrix also has rank 2 (e.g., the submatrix from columns 1 and 3 has determinant $-1-1=-2 \\neq 0$).\n\nSince the matrix $[D(s) \\quad N(s)]$ has full row rank for all $s$, the matrices $D(s)$ and $N(s)$ are left coprime.\n\nTherefore, a valid left coprime factorization is:\n\\[\nD(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & s-1 \\\\ s+2 & s-1 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\\[\nN(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ s & s+2 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\n<<<\n\\[\nD(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & s-1 \\\\ s+2 & s-1 \\end{bmatrix}, \\quad N(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ s & s+2 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n>>>"
