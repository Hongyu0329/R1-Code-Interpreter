    "The equivalent of the Gaulish name \"Odobeccus\" in French is not a direct one-for-one translation but can be understood by breaking down its constituent parts and tracing their evolution into modern French. The name is composed of two elements: \"Odo-\" and \"-beccus\".\n\nThe second part of the name, **-beccus**, is of Gaulish origin and means \"beak\". This term was adopted into Latin and subsequently evolved into the modern French word **\"bec\"**. The meaning of \"bec\" in French is \"beak\".\n\nThe first element, **Odo-**, is not of Gaulish but of Germanic origin, meaning \"wealth\" or \"riches\". This name element was common among Germanic tribes and gave rise to several French names, including **Odon** and **Eudes**. The historical figure Odobeccus was a general in Roman Gaul who was sent to get aid from the Franks and Alemans, both Germanic peoples, which could explain the combination of a Germanic first name with a Gaulish-origin second element.\n\nTherefore, a literal breakdown of \"Odobeccus\" would combine these meanings, suggesting a name like \"Wealthy Beak\" or \"Rich Beak\". While there is no single attested French name that is a direct descendant of \"Odobeccus\", the French equivalents of its components are **Odon** (or **Eudes**) and **bec**.\n\nAn unverified source suggests the equivalent is \"Sent-du-Bec\", however, the etymological evidence for the components of \"Odobeccus\" does not support this translation.\n\n<<<Odon-Bec or Eudes-Bec>>>"
