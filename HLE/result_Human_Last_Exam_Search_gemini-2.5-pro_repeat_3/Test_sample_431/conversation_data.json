    "There are three Cysteine residues located in the TM3-TM4 linker domains of the human GABAAρ1 homomeric receptor.\n\nThe human Gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor subunit rho-1 (GABAAρ1), also known as GABRR1, is cataloged in the UniProt database under the accession number P24046. This receptor, like other GABAA receptor subunits, features four transmembrane (TM) domains.\n\nThe specific locations of the third and fourth transmembrane domains are:\n*   **TM3:** Amino acid positions 294-315\n*   **TM4:** Amino acid positions 432-453\n\nThe region connecting these two domains, known as the TM3-TM4 linker, spans from amino acid 316 to 431. The amino acid sequence of this linker is:\nRRAASLKVPSLNLMHPSSDVAVPAKNKPAPTPNDSDAALYSCRARFPQAHSLVSRRSLSPEHSTEIKVIDRHSNRAVQLQISSHNASPARTSVLYALHQQDSGCSVSLPVSLGPSLLDPLAPGPRCVLTGESAIP\n\nWithin this specific sequence, there are three cysteine (C) residues.\n\n<<<3>>>"
