    "Within the Lviv-Warsaw School of philosophy, it is **Tadeusz Kotarbiński** who is credited with decomposing the notion of signs into symptoms and signals. This distinction is a key element of his work in praxeology, the theory of efficient action.\n\nThis philosophical breakdown can be traced back to the foundational work of his teacher and the founder of the Lviv-Warsaw School, **Kazimierz Twardowski**. Twardowski's descriptive semiotics included the concepts of \"symptoms and indicators/signals\" (*objawy i wskaźniki*), as well as \"characteristic features\" (*cechy charakterystyczne*), which are akin to hallmarks. Twardowski laid the groundwork by analyzing how psychophysical products could serve as signs of mental life.\n\nBuilding upon this, Kotarbiński, in the development of his praxeology, formalized the division of signs. In his framework, signs are categorized into two primary types: symptoms and signals. Signals are further subdivided into asemantic appeals and semantic signals. This classification helps to analyze communication and action in a precise and logical manner, a characteristic pursuit of the Lviv-Warsaw School.\n\n<<<Tadeusz Kotarbiński>>>"
