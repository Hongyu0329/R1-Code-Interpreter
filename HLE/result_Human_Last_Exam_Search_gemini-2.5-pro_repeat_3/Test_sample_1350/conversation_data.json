    "In William Morris's *The House of the Wolfings*, it is not a specific character who visits a Roman city and describes their religious practices, but rather the omniscient narrator of the novel who draws a direct parallel to the Roman founding myth of Romulus and Remus.\n\nThe novel centers on the conflict between the Goths of the House of Wolfing and the invading Roman army. The Wolfings, as their name suggests, use a wolf as their emblem. The narrator explicitly contrasts this with the Roman symbol of the she-wolf that suckled Romulus and Remus.\n\nThis comparison is most clearly stated in a passage describing a battle at the Wolfings' main hall. The narrator observes: \"So fiercely on that fair morning burned the hatred of men about the dwellings of the children of the Wolf of the Goths, wherein the children of the Wolf of Rome were shut up as in a penfold of slaughter.\" This line directly refers to the Romans as \"children of the Wolf of Rome,\" a clear allusion to their mythological origins.\n\nWhile the novel describes the Romans as \"city-dwelling,\" no character from the House of the Wolfings is depicted as having visited a Roman city and then reporting back on their religious customs. The allusion to Romulus and Remus is a literary device employed by the narrator to create a symbolic opposition between the two warring cultures.\n\n<<<The narrator of the novel.>>>"
