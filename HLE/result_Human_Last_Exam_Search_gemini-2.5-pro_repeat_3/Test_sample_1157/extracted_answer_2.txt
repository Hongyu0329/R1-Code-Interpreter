The appropriate management for the patient involves a phased approach. Initially, emergency care will focus on managing the trauma and her uncontrolled diabetes, without replanting the avulsed teeth due to the 28-hour delay. The cells of interest are primarily those involved in wound healing, such as osteoclasts, osteoblasts, and fibroblasts, whose function is compromised by her diabetic state. For long-term restoration, a cast metal (cobalt-chromium) removable partial denture is recommended. The abutment teeth for this denture would be the left central incisor and the left second premolar, chosen for their strategic position adjacent to the missing teeth, provided they are periodontally sound.
