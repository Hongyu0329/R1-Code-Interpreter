    "A total of eight finite groups contain maximal by inclusion product-free sets of size 2.\n\nThe classification of these groups was provided by Michael Giudici and Sarah Hart in their paper \"Small maximal sum-free sets\". A product-free set *S* in a group *G* is a non-empty subset where for any two elements *a, b ∈ S* (not necessarily distinct), their product *ab* is not in *S*. Such a set is called maximal by inclusion (or locally maximal) if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set in *G*.\n\nThe finite groups that contain a maximal by inclusion product-free set of size 2 are:\n*   The cyclic group of order 5, denoted as C₅.\n*   The cyclic group of order 6, denoted as C₆.\n*   The cyclic group of order 7, denoted as C₇.\n*   The cyclic group of order 8, denoted as C₈.\n*   The cyclic group of order 9, denoted as C₉.\n*   The Klein four-group, which is the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 2, denoted as C₂ × C₂.\n*   The dihedral group of order 6, denoted as D₆ (which is isomorphic to the symmetric group S₃).\n*   The quaternion group of order 12, denoted as Q₁₂.\n\nInitially, the classification presented in the paper by Giudici and Hart lists the groups in three tables, along with two additional groups. A careful count of the distinct groups from these lists reveals a total of eight unique finite groups.\n\n<<<8>>>"
