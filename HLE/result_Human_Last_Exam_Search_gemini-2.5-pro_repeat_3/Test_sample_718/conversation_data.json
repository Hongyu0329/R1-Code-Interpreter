    "A tame functor $f: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K$, where $J$ is an upper semilattice, is $n$-resolvable for $n=1$. This is because the projective dimension of any such functor is at most 1.\n\nAn object is defined as *n*-resolvable if it has a projective resolution of length at most *n*. The smallest such integer *n* is known as the object's projective dimension. For a functor category like $\\text{Fun}(J, \\text{Vect}_K)$, where $J$ is a poset, the projective objects are direct sums of representable functors.\n\nA functor is called \"tame\" if its behavior is determined by its values on a finite subposet; more formally, it is a left Kan extension of a functor from a finite subposet. When the indexing poset $J$ is an upper semilattice, the category of tame functors has particularly strong homological properties.\n\nFor any tame functor $F$ from an upper semilattice to the category of vector spaces, one can construct a minimal free resolution. A key result in the homological algebra of such functors is that the first syzygy—that is, the kernel of the epimorphism from a projective cover $P_0$ to $F$—is itself a projective functor. This means the projective resolution is of the form:\n\n$0 \\to P_1 \\to P_0 \\to F \\to 0$\n\nwhere $P_0$ and $P_1$ are projective functors. The existence of such a resolution of length 1 implies that the projective dimension of $F$ is at most 1. Consequently, any such functor is 1-resolvable. The ability to use tools like Koszul complexes for the computation of homological invariants for functors on upper semilattices underscores their well-behaved nature.\n\n<<<1>>>"
