    "The puzzle describes a transformation rule applied to a grid of numbers. Let's deduce the rule from the given examples.\n\n### Analysis of the Transformation Rule\n\n1.  **Grid Representation**: The input and output strings can be seen as grids of numbers, where commas separate the rows. The numbers are '0', '1', and '2'.\n\n2.  **Core Operation**: In both `Example A` and `Example B`, the transformation involves a single '2' swapping its position with a single '0'.\n    *   In `Example A`, the '2' at position (row=1, col=1) swaps with the '0' at (row=0, col=0).\n    *   In `Example B`, the '2' at position (row=3, col=6) swaps with the '0' at (row=2, col=7).\n\n3.  **Identifying the Pattern**: The key is to determine why a specific '0' is chosen for the swap. The choice appears to depend on the position of the '2'.\n    *   Let the position of '2' be `(r, c)`, using 0-based indexing.\n    *   In **Example A**: The '2' is at `(1, 1)`. The sum of its coordinates is `1 + 1 = 2` (an even number). The '0' it swaps with is at `(0, 0)`, which is the North-West (NW) neighbor `(r-1, c-1)`.\n    *   In **Example B**: The '2' is at `(3, 6)`. The sum of its coordinates is `3 + 6 = 9` (an odd number). The '0' it swaps with is at `(2, 7)`, which is the North-East (NE) neighbor `(r-1, c+1)`.\n\n### The Discovered Rule\n\nThe transformation rule is as follows:\n*   Find the position `(r, c)` of each '2' in the input grid.\n*   If the sum of its coordinates `r + c` is **even**, it attempts to swap with its North-West neighbor at `(r-1, c-1)`.\n*   If the sum of its coordinates `r + c` is **odd**, it attempts to swap with its North-East neighbor at `(r-1, c+1)`.\n*   The swap only occurs if the target neighbor cell contains a '0'.\n\n### Applying the Rule to Input_C\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to `Input_C` to find the value of `MISSING`.\n\n*   **Input_C**: `'000000,011120,111111'`\n*   **Grid Representation**:\n    ```\n    000000\n    011120\n    111111\n    ```\n*   **Find the '2'**: The number '2' is located at `(r, c) = (1, 4)`.\n*   **Check the coordinate sum**: The sum is `1 + 4 = 5`, which is an **odd** number.\n*   **Determine the target**: For an odd sum, the rule is to target the North-East (NE) neighbor at `(r-1, c+1)`, which is `(1-1, 4+1) = (0, 5)`.\n*   **Check the target cell**: The value in the grid at position `(0, 5)` is the last character of the first row, which is '0'.\n*   **Perform the swap**: Since the target cell contains a '0', the swap is executed. The '2' from `(1, 4)` moves to `(0, 5)`, and the '0' from `(0, 5)` moves to `(1, 4)`.\n\n### Calculating the Output\n\n*   **Original Row 0**: `000000`\n*   **Original Row 1**: `011120`\n*   **Original Row 2**: `111111`\n\nAfter swapping the values at `(0, 5)` and `(1, 4)`:\n*   **New Row 0**: The '0' at index 5 becomes a '2' -> `000002`\n*   **New Row 1**: The '2' at index 4 becomes a '0' -> `011100`\n*   **New Row 2**: No change -> `111111`\n\nCombining the new rows gives the final output string.\n\n<<<000002,011100,111111>>>"
