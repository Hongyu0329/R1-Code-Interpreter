    "In the surface code, the number of logical qubits that can be encoded on a given surface is determined by its topology. For a simple, planar patch of surface code without any defects, one logical qubit can be stored.\n\nWhen holes (also referred to as punctures or defects) are introduced into the surface, they create additional boundaries. Each independent hole provides the topological resources to encode one additional logical qubit. Therefore, a single patch of surface code with two holes can encode two logical qubits.\n\nSince there are two such independent patches, the total number of logical qubits is the sum of the qubits in each patch.\n\n*   **Patch 1:** Contains two holes, encoding 2 logical qubits.\n*   **Patch 2:** Contains two holes, encoding 2 logical qubits.\n\nThe total maximum number of logical qubits that can be encoded is 2 + 2 = 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
