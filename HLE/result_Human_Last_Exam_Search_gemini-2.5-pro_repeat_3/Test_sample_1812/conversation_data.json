    "The determinant of the given matrix is 0.\n\nThe matrix provided is:\n\\[ A = \\begin{bmatrix} 2 & -1 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 2 & -1 \\\\ -1 & -1 & 2 \\end{bmatrix} \\]\n\nTo compute the determinant of this 3x3 matrix, we can use the Sarrus rule or cofactor expansion.\n\nUsing the formula for a 3x3 matrix:\ndet(A) = 2 * (2 * 2 - (-1) * (-1)) - (-1) * ((-1) * 2 - (-1) * (-1)) + (-1) * ((-1) * (-1) - 2 * (-1))\ndet(A) = 2 * (4 - 1) + 1 * (-2 - 1) - 1 * (1 + 2)\ndet(A) = 2 * 3 - 3 - 3\ndet(A) = 6 - 6\ndet(A) = 0\n\nAlternatively, one can observe that the sum of the elements in each row is zero (e.g., for the first row, 2 + (-1) + (-1) = 0). A property of square matrices states that if the sum of the elements in any row or column is zero, the determinant of the matrix is zero.\n\nThe context provided about the \"Markov quiver for \\( m_{1/2} = 13 \\)\" relates to advanced topics in cluster algebras and representation theory. The Markov equation is x² + y² + z² = 3xyz, and 13 is one of the Markov numbers, which are integer solutions to this equation. The \"Markov quiver\" is a specific directed graph associated with this equation. The matrix A is the Cartan matrix for the affine Dynkin diagram of type Ã₂, and it is also related to the Markov quiver. However, for the specific question of computing the determinant of the provided matrix, this context does not alter the matrix or the result.\n\n<<<0>>>"
