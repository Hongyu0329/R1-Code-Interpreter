    "The minimal number of triangles needed for triangulating the outer hull of the great icosahedron corresponds to the number of faces of its convex hull. The convex hull of the great icosahedron is a regular icosahedron. A regular icosahedron is a Platonic solid with 20 faces, all of which are equilateral triangles. Therefore, the outer hull is already triangulated by these 20 faces.\n\nThe great icosahedron itself is a non-convex polyhedron with 20 intersecting triangular faces. When considering its \"outer-hull,\" we are looking at the smallest convex shape that encloses it, which is the regular icosahedron. Since a regular icosahedron is composed of 20 triangular faces, this is the minimal number of triangles required.\n\n<<<20>>>"
