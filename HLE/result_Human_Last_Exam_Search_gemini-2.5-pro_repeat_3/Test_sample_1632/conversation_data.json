    "The number of n-step self-avoiding walks, denoted as a(n), on a Manhattan lattice (also known as a square lattice) has been a subject of significant interest in combinatorics and statistical physics. While a closed-form formula for a(n) is not known, the values for small n have been computed through various algorithmic methods.\n\nA self-avoiding walk is a path on a lattice that does not visit the same point more than once. The number of such walks of a given length 'n' grows exponentially. For a square lattice, the number of self-avoiding walks for small 'n' are:\n*   a(1) = 4\n*   a(2) = 12\n*   a(3) = 36\n*   a(4) = 100\n\nFor a 10-step self-avoiding walk, the value a(10) has been calculated to be 44,100. This value is part of a sequence that has been computed for up to n=79, though the computational effort required increases significantly with n.\n\n<<<44100>>>"
