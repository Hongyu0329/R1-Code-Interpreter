It is not definitively true that the second postulate of special relativity is superfluous and can be deduced from the first without additional assumptions. While applying the first postulate to Maxwell's equations of electromagnetism leads to the constancy of the speed of light, the first postulate alone can also be consistent with Galilean relativity. Therefore, the second postulate, or an equivalent assumption, is generally considered necessary to uniquely establish the framework of special relativity.
