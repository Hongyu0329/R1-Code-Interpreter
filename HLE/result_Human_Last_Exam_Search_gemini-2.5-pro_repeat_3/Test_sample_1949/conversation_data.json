    "Of the rivers mentioned in Virgil's epic poem, the *Aeneid*, the three longest that can be measured are a mix of real-world and mythological waterways, with the latter's lengths being more symbolic than literal. The longest terrestrial river mentioned is the Aras, followed by the Tiber. The mythological rivers of the Underworld, while central to the narrative, do not have specified lengths.\n\nThe three longest rivers mentioned in the *Aeneid* are:\n\n*   **The Aras River:** This is the longest real-world river mentioned in the *Aeneid*. It flows through Turkey, Armenia, Iran, and Azerbaijan. Its total length is 1,072 kilometers (666 miles).\n*   **The Tiber River:** As the main river of Rome, the Tiber is a significant feature in the latter half of the *Aeneid*. It is the third-longest river in Italy, with a length of 406 kilometers (252 miles).\n*   **The Acheron:** While a real river in Greece with a length of 52 kilometers, the Acheron is more prominently featured in the *Aeneid* as one of the principal rivers of the Underworld. In the mythological context, its size is vast and symbolic, representing the boundary to the afterlife.\n\nThe other mythological rivers of the Underworld mentioned in the *Aeneid* include the Styx, Lethe, Phlegethon, and Cocytus. Ancient sources describe these rivers in relation to each other; for instance, the Styx is said to circle the Underworld seven times, and the Cocytus is a branch of the Styx. However, their lengths are not quantified in a way that allows for a direct comparison with terrestrial rivers.\n\n<<<The three longest rivers mentioned in the Aeneid are the Aras River, the Tiber River, and the Acheron.>>>"
