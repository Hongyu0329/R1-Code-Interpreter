**1. The Agrippan Trilemma (or The Regress Problem of Justification)**

The JTB definition requires a belief to be justified, but it fails to specify how this justification is supposed to work without running into a logical dead end. This issue is known as the Agrippan Trilemma, which presents three exhaustive but problematic options for the structure of justification:
*   **Infinite Regress:** For a belief to be justified, it must be supported by another justified belief, which in turn must be supported by another, and so on, creating an infinite chain. This is problematic because a belief at the end of an infinite chain can never be fully justified.
*   **Circularity:** A belief's justification eventually loops back on itself (e.g., A is justified by B, and B is justified by A). This is a form of fallacious circular reasoning that provides no actual grounding for the belief.
*   **Axiomatic/Dogmatic Assumption:** The chain of justification stops at a certain belief that is asserted to be true without further justification. This is an arbitrary, dogmatic endpoint that undermines the claim of the entire chain being justified.

The JTB model, by simply stating "justification" is a necessary condition, does not solve this trilemma. It does not provide a mechanism to ground justification, leaving the "J" component foundationless and making it a significant problem for the definition itself.

**2. The Problem of Fallibility (or The Internalism/Externalism Divide)**

This problem arises from the relationship between the subject's internal state (their mind) and the external world. The "Truth" condition of the JTB definition is an externalist condition; it depends on the actual state of the world, which is external to the believer's mind. The "Justification" condition, however, is often interpreted as an internalist concept, meaning it depends on factors within the subject's cognitive grasp, like their evidence and reasoning.

The problem is that, from the first-person perspective, a Justified *True* Belief (Knowledge) and a Justified *False* Belief can be indistinguishable. A person can have excellent reasons and feel entirely justified in a belief that, due to factors unknown to them, turns out to be false. Since the only available epistemic states are "Knowledge" and "Belief," this person is in a state of "Belief," yet their internal cognitive state is identical to that of someone who possesses "Knowledge."

This creates a critical issue:
*   It makes knowledge inaccessible from the first-person perspective. A person can never be certain that they are in a state of "Knowledge" rather than a state of "Justified False Belief" because they cannot step outside their own mind to infallibly check the "Truth" condition against reality.
*   It means the JTB definition provides an observer's, or "God's-eye," view of knowledge rather than a useful criterion for the believer themselves. Because fallibilism—the view that our beliefs and knowledge are inherently open to being wrong—is widely accepted, the JTB model's reliance on an inaccessible external truth condition is a fundamental flaw.
