(a) Diversity Order:**
*   **$\mathbf{S}_a$:** The diversity order is 1.
*   **$\mathbf{S}_b$:** The diversity order is 1.
*   **$\mathbf{S}_c$:** The diversity order is 2.

**(b) Maximum Directivity (Diversity Gain):**
*   Code **$\mathbf{S}_c$** provides the maximum diversity gain because it is the only code among the three to achieve the full diversity order of 2.
