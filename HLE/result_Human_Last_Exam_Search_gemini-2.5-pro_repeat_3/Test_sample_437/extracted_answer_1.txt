The evaluation of the integral $\langle \phi_i | \frac{1}{r} | \phi_j\rangle$ for two 1s Slater-type orbitals with exponents $\zeta_i$ and $\zeta_j$ centered on the same atom is $\frac{4(\zeta_i \zeta_j)^{3/2}}{(\zeta_i + \zeta_j)^2}$. In the specific case where the orbitals are identical ($\phi_i = \phi_j$, and thus $\zeta_i = \zeta_j = \zeta$), the integral simplifies to $\zeta$.
