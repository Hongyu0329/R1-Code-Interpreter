The proposed approach is not valid because it relies on human visual perception, which is fundamentally different from the visual system of the primary predators (birds) that drive the evolution of bumblebee mimicry. The inability of humans and standard photographs to perceive ultraviolet light—a key component of avian vision—means the resulting similarity rankings would not reflect the ecologically relevant signals.
