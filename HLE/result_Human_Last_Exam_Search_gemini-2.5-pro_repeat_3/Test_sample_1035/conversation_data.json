    "The problem asks for the minimum total number of vertices in a family of bipartite graphs that cover all edges of the complete graph \\( K_{35} \\). This problem has two common interpretations in graph theory:\n\n1.  **Edge Covering:** The union of the edge sets of the bipartite graphs is the edge set of \\(K_{35}\\). Overlapping edges are allowed.\n2.  **Edge Partition (Decomposition):** The edge sets of the bipartite graphs are mutually disjoint, and their union is the edge set of \\(K_{35}\\).\n\nThe phrasing \"covering all the edges\" can be ambiguous, but in many combinatorial contexts, it implies a partition. Furthermore, the problem of finding the minimum sum of vertices for a covering is a known open problem for \\( n=35 \\), whereas for a partition, there is a well-established construction that is conjectured to be optimal. Let's analyze the partition problem.\n\nA well-known result by Graham and Pollak states that any decomposition of the edges of \\(K_n\\) into complete bipartite subgraphs requires at least \\(n-1\\) subgraphs. Tverberg later generalized this, showing that at least \\(n-1\\) bipartite subgraphs are needed, even if they are not complete. For \\(K_{35}\\), this means at least 34 bipartite graphs are required.\n\nWe seek to minimize the sum of the number of vertices of these bipartite subgraphs. Let's consider a specific construction for partitioning \\(K_n\\) into \\(n-1\\) bipartite graphs. This method is often called the \"star decomposition.\"\n\nLet the vertices of \\(K_{35}\\) be \\(v_1, v_2, \\dots, v_{35}\\).\n1.  The first bipartite graph, \\(B_1\\), is a star graph with \\(v_1\\) as the center and edges connecting to all other 34 vertices \\(\\{v_2, \\dots, v_{35}\\}\\). This graph, \\(K_{1,34}\\), is bipartite, contains 34 edges, and has 35 vertices. The remaining edges form a complete graph \\(K_{34}\\) on the vertices \\(\\{v_2, \\dots, v_{35}\\}\\).\n2.  The second bipartite graph, \\(B_2\\), is a star centered at \\(v_2\\) with edges to the remaining 33 vertices in the \\(K_{34}\\). This graph has 34 vertices.\n3.  This process continues, where each step peels off a star graph from the remaining complete subgraph.\n4.  The final graph, \\(B_{34}\\), will be a single edge connecting \\(v_{34}\\) and \\(v_{35}\\), which is a bipartite graph with 2 vertices.\n\nThe total number of vertices in this family of 34 bipartite graphs is the sum of the number of vertices in each graph:\n\\(S = 35 + 34 + 33 + \\dots + 2\\)\n\nThis is an arithmetic series. The sum can be calculated as:\n\\(S = \\sum_{i=2}^{35} i = \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{35} i\\right) - 1 = \\frac{35 \\times (35+1)}{2} - 1\\)\n\\(S = \\frac{35 \\times 36}{2} - 1 = 35 \\times 18 - 1 = 630 - 1 = 629\\)\n\nThis value of \\(\\binom{n+1}{2} - 1\\) is conjectured to be the minimum for all odd \\(n\\) (the Krasikov-Roditty conjecture) and has been proven for several small values of \\(n\\). While the conjecture remains open for \\(n=35\\), the star decomposition provides a strong upper bound and is the most likely intended answer.\n\n<<<629>>>"
