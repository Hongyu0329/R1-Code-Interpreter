The number of non-Clifford gates for a simulation is algorithm-dependent and cannot be specified as a single number. For implementation with a distance-5 code and a 1% error rate, the overhead from magic state distillation would be exceptionally high, likely requiring hundreds of physical non-Clifford gates to create one logical gate. For a large-scale algorithm, this would result in a total of hundreds of billions to trillions of physical non-Clifford gates.
