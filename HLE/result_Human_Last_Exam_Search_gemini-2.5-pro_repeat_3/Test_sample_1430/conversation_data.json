    "### Smallest and Largest Rank of the Néron-Severi Group Determined\n\nThe smallest and largest possible ranks of the Néron-Severi group of the 15th symmetric power, X, of a genus 3 Riemann surface, C, are 2 and 10, respectively. This conclusion is reached by analyzing the relationship between the Néron-Severi group of X and the Jacobian of C.\n\nThe Néron-Severi group, denoted NS(X), consists of divisors on a variety X modulo algebraic equivalence, and its rank is known as the Picard number, ρ(X). For the d-th symmetric power of a smooth projective curve C of genus g, where d ≥ g-1, the rank of the Néron-Severi group is given by the formula ρ(Sym^d(C)) = ρ(J(C)) + 1. In this case, with C being a genus 3 curve (g=3) and X being its 15th symmetric power (d=15), the condition is satisfied, and thus the rank of the Néron-Severi group of X is ρ(X) = ρ(J(C)) + 1.\n\nThe problem is therefore reduced to finding the minimum and maximum possible values for the rank of the Néron-Severi group of the Jacobian variety J(C) of a genus 3 curve.\n\n**Smallest Possible Rank**\n\nFor a \"very general\" curve C of genus 3, its Jacobian J(C) possesses only the trivial endomorphisms, which are multiplications by integers. In such cases, the Néron-Severi group of the Jacobian, NS(J(C)), is isomorphic to the integers (ℤ), and its rank is 1. This is the minimum possible rank for the Jacobian of a genus 3 curve.\n\nConsequently, the smallest possible rank for NS(X) is:\nρ_min(X) = ρ_min(J(C)) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2.\n\n**Largest Possible Rank**\n\nThe largest possible rank of the Néron-Severi group occurs for special curves whose Jacobians have complex multiplication (CM) and are of a specific type. The rank of the Néron-Severi group of a g-dimensional abelian variety is bounded by the Hodge number h¹¹, which is equal to g². For a genus 3 curve, the Jacobian J(C) has dimension g=3, so the maximum possible rank is 3² = 9.\n\nThis maximum rank is achieved for curves whose Jacobian is isogenous to the product of three copies of an elliptic curve with complex multiplication (E³). Examples of such genus 3 curves include the Fermat quartic curve (x⁴ + y⁴ + z⁴ = 0) and the Klein quartic curve (x³y + y³z + z³x = 0). The Jacobian of the Fermat quartic is isogenous to the product of three copies of the elliptic curve with CM by the Gaussian integers ℤ[i]. Similarly, the Jacobian of the Klein quartic is isogenous to the product of three elliptic curves with CM by the Eisenstein integers ℤ[(-1+√-7)/2]. For these curves, the rank of the Néron-Severi group of their Jacobian is 9.\n\nTherefore, the largest possible rank for NS(X) is:\nρ_max(X) = ρ_max(J(C)) + 1 = 9 + 1 = 10.\n\n<<<Smallest rank: 2, Largest rank: 10>>>"
