An FGH-tripled fixed point for the functions F: X × Y × Z → X, G: Y × X × Z → Y, and H: Z × Y × X → Z is a point (x, y, z) ∈ X × Y × Z such that F(x, y, z) = x, G(y, x, z) = y, and H(z, y, x) = z. The conditions for the existence and uniqueness of such a point are typically established in the framework of partially ordered complete metric spaces. The primary conditions are: the spaces X, Y, and Z must be partially ordered complete metric spaces; the functions F, G, and H must satisfy a mixed monotone property and a contractive condition; there must exist an initial triplet of points (x₀, y₀, z₀) that satisfies an ordered relationship with the functions; and either the functions are continuous or the spaces are regular. For uniqueness, an additional comparability condition is needed.
