    "An FGH-tripled fixed point for the functions F: X × Y × Z → X, G: Y × X × Z → Y, and H: Z × Y × X → Z is a point (x, y, z) ∈ X × Y × Z such that:\n*   F(x, y, z) = x\n*   G(y, x, z) = y\n*   H(z, y, x) = z\n\nThe conditions for the existence and uniqueness of such a point are typically established in the framework of partially ordered metric spaces. These conditions relate to the properties of the spaces X, Y, and Z, the nature of the functions F, G, and H, and the fulfillment of a contractive inequality.\n\nThe primary conditions are as follows:\n\n### **1. Properties of the Spaces**\n\nThe sets X, Y, and Z must be **partially ordered complete metric spaces**. This means that for each set, there is a defined partial order relation (e.g., ≤ₓ, ≤ᵧ, ≤₂), a metric (e.g., dₓ, dᵧ, d₂), and every Cauchy sequence in the space converges to a point within that space.\n\n### **2. Mixed Monotone Property**\n\nThe functions F, G, and H must satisfy a **mixed monotone property**. This property links the ordering in the domain of the functions to the ordering in their codomain. For F: X × Y × Z → X, G: Y × X × Z → Y, and H: Z × Y × X → Z, the mixed monotone property is defined as follows:\n\n*   **For F:** For any y ∈ Y and z ∈ Z, the function F is monotone non-decreasing in its first argument (from X) and monotone non-increasing in its third argument (from Z).\n*   **For G:** For any x ∈ X and z ∈ Z, the function G is monotone non-decreasing in its first argument (from Y) and monotone non-increasing in its second argument (from X).\n*   **For H:** For any y ∈ Y and x ∈ X, the function H is monotone non-decreasing in its first argument (from Z) and monotone non-increasing in its third argument (from X).\n\nMore formally, for any x₁, x₂ ∈ X, y₁, y₂ ∈ Y, and z₁, z₂ ∈ Z:\n\n*   If x₁ ≤ₓ x₂, then F(x₁, y, z) ≤ₓ F(x₂, y, z) for any y ∈ Y, z ∈ Z.\n*   If y₁ ≤ᵧ y₂, then F(x, y₁, z) is not specified to be monotone.\n*   If z₁ ≤₂ z₂, then F(x, y, z₁) ≥ₓ F(x, y, z₂) for any x ∈ X, y ∈ Y.\n*   And similarly for G and H according to their specified domains and monotonicity.\n\n### **3. Contractive Condition**\n\nThe functions F, G, and H must jointly satisfy a **contractive condition**. This condition ensures that when the functions are applied iteratively, the distances between successive points decrease, leading to convergence. A common form of this condition is that for all x, u ∈ X, y, v ∈ Y, and z, w ∈ Z with x ≥ u, y ≤ v, and z ≥ w, the following inequality holds:\n\ndₓ(F(x, y, z), F(u, v, w)) + dᵧ(G(y, x, z), G(v, u, w)) + d₂(H(z, y, x), H(w, v, u)) ≤ k [dₓ(x, u) + dᵧ(y, v) + d₂(z, w)]\n\nwhere k is a constant in the range [0, 1). More complex contractive conditions involving functions can also be used.\n\n### **4. Existence of an Initial Point**\n\nThere must exist an initial triplet of points **(x₀, y₀, z₀) ∈ X × Y × Z** that satisfies the following ordered relationship with the functions:\n\n*   x₀ ≤ₓ F(x₀, y₀, z₀)\n*   y₀ ≥ᵧ G(y₀, x₀, z₀)\n*   z₀ ≤₂ H(z₀, y₀, x₀)\n\nThis condition provides a starting point for the iterative process that will converge to the FGH-tripled fixed point.\n\n### **5. Continuity or Regularity**\n\nTo guarantee the existence of the fixed point, one of the following conditions must hold:\n\n*   **Continuity:** The functions F, G, and H are continuous.\n*   **Regularity of the Space:** If the functions are not necessarily continuous, the partially ordered metric spaces must be *regular*. A partially ordered metric space is regular if for any non-decreasing sequence {xₙ} that converges to x, we have xₙ ≤ x for all n, and for any non-increasing sequence {yₙ} that converges to y, we have y ≤ yₙ for all n.\n\nUnder these conditions, there exists at least one FGH-tripled fixed point. For the **uniqueness** of the fixed point, an additional condition is typically required: for any two triplets (x, y, z) and (x*, y*, z*) in X × Y × Z, there exists a third triplet (u, v, w) that is comparable to both.\n\n<<<An FGH-tripled fixed point for the functions F: X × Y × Z → X, G: Y × X × Z → Y, and H: Z × Y × X → Z is a point (x, y, z) ∈ X × Y × Z such that F(x, y, z) = x, G(y, x, z) = y, and H(z, y, x) = z.
