    "The dance in which it is impossible to overturn a reverse turn without disregarding the technique is the European Tango. This is due to the fundamental principles that define the dance, which are in direct opposition to the mechanics required for an overturned turn.\n\nThe core characteristics of European Tango technique include:\n*   **No Rise and Fall:** Tango is a \"flat\" dance, meaning there is no vertical elevation of the body as in the waltz. The movement is grounded and level.\n*   **No Sway:** The body does not sway from side to side. The upper body is kept toned and moves as a block.\n*   **Staccato Movement:** Tango is known for its sharp, staccato actions and footwork, often with a \"stealthy, almost cat-like\" quality. This is in contrast to the continuous, flowing movement of swing dances.\n*   **No Continuous Flow:** The dance is about controlled, precise movements and stops, not continuous, swinging rotation.\n\nTo \"overturn\" a turn, a dancer would need to create continuous, flowing momentum. This is typically achieved in dances like the Waltz, Foxtrot, and Quickstep by using sway, rise and fall, and a continuous swinging motion of the body. Introducing these elements into a Tango reverse turn would fundamentally violate its core technical principles. The resulting movement would no longer be recognizable as Tango.\n\nWhile some advanced Tango figures are labeled as \"overturned,\" such as the \"Overturned Five Step\" or an \"overturned Natural Twist Turn,\" these are specific, choreographed figures with a defined amount of extra rotation and do not represent a general technical possibility of overturning standard turns at will. The technique for a standard Tango Reverse Turn does not allow for a continuous, flowing overturn in the way a Waltz or Foxtrot does. In those swing dances, overturning a reverse turn is a common variation used to navigate the dance floor. In Tango, the specific technique of rotation and foot placement makes such an action impossible without breaking the characteristic style of the dance.\n\n<<<C>>>"
