    "## Five Colors Distinguish the Pure Allotropes of Phosphorus\n\nAt least five distinct colors and color phenomena can be observed in the pure allotropes of the element phosphorus: white (which can appear yellow), red, violet, black, and a greenish glow. These variations in appearance are due to the different atomic arrangements in each allotrope.\n\nThe most common allotropes of phosphorus are white, red, and black. **White phosphorus**, when pure, is a translucent, waxy solid that is white or colorless. However, it often takes on a yellowish hue due to impurities or gradual degradation into red phosphorus, leading to the common name \"yellow phosphorus\". A notable characteristic of white phosphorus is its ability to glow greenish in the dark when exposed to air, a phenomenon known as chemiluminescence.\n\n**Red phosphorus** is known for its characteristic deep red color. This allotrope can exhibit a range of shades, including orange-red, reddish-violet, and dark red-purple. It can also have an iron-grey luster.\n\n**Black phosphorus** is the most thermodynamically stable form of the element and has a black, flaky appearance similar to graphite, often with a metallic luster. It can also be found as a grey crystalline solid.\n\n**Violet phosphorus**, also known as Hittorf's phosphorus, displays a range of colors including violet, red-purple, and brown. It has been described as having a steely blue luster and can appear as purple-red or red-brown flakes. When ground into a fine powder, violet phosphorus can look red.\n\nOther allotropes include **blue phosphorus** and **diphosphorus**. The term \"blue phosphorus\" primarily refers to its atomic structure rather than its visible color, and there is no clear evidence that the bulk material appears blue. **Diphosphorus** is a gaseous form of the element that exists at very high temperatures and does not have a distinct color under normal observational conditions. There is also mention of phosphorus nanorods that appear red/brown.\n\nIn summary, the observable colors of pure phosphorus allotropes are:\n*   **White**, which can also appear **yellow**.\n*   **Red**, with shades ranging from orange-red to dark red-purple.\n*   **Black**, which may also appear grey.\n*   **Violet**, encompassing shades of purple, brown, and steely blue.\n*   A **greenish glow** emitted by white phosphorus.\n\n<<<5>>>"
