    "When the ligand 2,5-di(2-pyridyl)thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole reacts with *cis*-dichlorobis(bipyridine)ruthenium(II), it forms a dinuclear complex, not a simple mononuclear one. The ligand, which we can abbreviate as `dptztz`, acts as a bridging ligand, connecting two `[Ru(bpy)2]` units.\n\nThe structure of `dptztz` shows that it is a symmetric molecule. It has two equivalent bidentate coordination sites, each consisting of a pyridyl nitrogen and a thiazole nitrogen. The reaction of two equivalents of *cis*-[Ru(bpy)2Cl2] with one equivalent of `dptztz` displaces the chloride ions and forms the dinuclear complex `[(bpy)2Ru(dptztz)Ru(bpy)2]4+`.\n\nIn this dinuclear complex, each ruthenium center is octahedrally coordinated to two bipyridine (`bpy`) ligands and one of the bidentate sites of the bridging `dptztz` ligand. This creates two chiral `[Ru(bpy)2(N,N')]` centers. The chirality of each metal center is designated as either Delta (Δ) or Lambda (Λ).\n\nBecause the bridging ligand connects two such chiral centers, diastereomers can be formed. The possible combinations of the chiralities at the two ruthenium centers are:\n*   **Δ,Δ** and its enantiomer **Λ,Λ**. This pair constitutes the racemic or *rac* form.\n*   **Δ,Λ**. This is a *meso* compound because it contains a center of inversion and is achiral.\n\nTherefore, the reaction produces two distinct diastereomers: a *meso* form (Δ,Λ) and a *rac* form (the Δ,Δ/Λ,Λ enantiomeric pair). These two diastereomers have been successfully separated and characterized. While the *rac* form consists of two enantiomers, they are typically isolated together as a racemic mixture. Thus, the reaction yields two separable products, the *meso* and the *rac* diastereomers.\n\nIf the question is interpreted as the total number of stereoisomers formed, the answer would be three: the two enantiomers of the *rac* form (Δ,Δ and Λ,Λ) and the single *meso* form (Δ,Λ). However, in practice, this is considered as two isomers that can be isolated: the meso isomer and the racemic mixture. Based on the common interpretation in stereochemistry, which counts distinct separable products, two isomers are formed.\n\n<<<2>>>"
