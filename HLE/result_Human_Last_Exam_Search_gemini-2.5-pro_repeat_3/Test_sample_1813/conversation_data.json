    "Based on the research paper \"A Generalization of Markov Numbers,\" the generalized Markov number \\( m_{p/q} \\) is associated with a rational number \\( p/q \\). For the specific case of \\( p/q = 4/7 \\), the paper provides a value for the number itself and an associated continued fraction.\n\nIn Table 1 of the paper, the generalized Markov number \\( m_{4/7} \\) is listed as 5. The continued fraction of the integer 5 is simply \\(\\).\n\nHowever, the paper also defines a continued fraction, denoted \\(x_{p/q}\\), which is algorithmically derived from the continued fraction of \\(p/q\\). The authors state that \\(m_{p/q}\\) is the numerator of this continued fraction \\(x_{p/q}\\). In Table 2 of the same paper, the continued fraction associated with \\(p/q = 4/7\\) is given as \\(\\).\n\nThere is an inconsistency in the source paper, as the numerator of the continued fraction \\(\\) is 8 (since \\(2 + 1/(1+1/2) = 8/3\\)), while the table of generalized Markov numbers lists \\(m_{4/7}\\) as 5.\n\nGiven that the question asks for the \"continued fraction associated with\" the generalized Markov number, the more specific and non-trivial answer from the developed theory is the continued fraction provided in Table 2 of the paper.\n\n<<<>>>"
