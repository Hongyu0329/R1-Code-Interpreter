    "I am unable to determine the exact number of *sissone fermes* Svetlana Zakharova performed in the Act II Odette variation of the 2014 Bolshoi Theatre's *Swan Lake* choreographed by Yuri Grigorovich.\n\nDespite extensive research, a video of the complete and unedited variation from this specific production is not publicly available for analysis. While recordings of the 2015 production with the same cast and choreographer exist on various platforms, access to the full performance is required to accurately count the specific ballet steps. Reviews and other written documentation of the performance do not provide this level of choreographic detail.\n\n<<<I am unable to provide an answer to the question.>>>"
