    "The rank of the flag of Denmark, when viewed as a matrix with values chosen to maximize the rank, is 2. The Danish flag has two colors, red and white, and its design consists of a red field with a white Nordic cross. This composition results in two distinct, linearly independent row patterns: the rows containing the horizontal white stripe, and the rows containing parts of the red field and the vertical white stripe. By assigning different numerical values to red and white, these two patterns can be made linearly independent, resulting in a maximal rank of 2.\n\nTo find which flags of African nations have the same linear algebraic rank, we need to identify those with designs that also result in exactly two linearly independent row patterns. This is generally true for flags with simple geometric compositions, such as:\n*   A plain field with a central emblem.\n*   Horizontal stripes with an emblem on one of the stripes.\n*   Bicolor or tricolor flags with a simple emblem or a vertical stripe that creates a second type of row pattern.\n\nAfter analyzing the flags of all 54 sovereign states in Africa, the following nations have flags with a maximal linear algebraic rank of 2:\n\n*   **Benin**: The flag features a vertical green band at the hoist and two horizontal bands (yellow and red) on the fly side. This creates two distinct row patterns: one with green and yellow, and another with green and red. These two patterns are linearly independent.\n\n*   **Burkina Faso**: The flag is composed of two horizontal bands of red and green, with a yellow star in the center. The rows with the star are distinct from the plain red and green rows, but all row patterns can be expressed as a linear combination of just two basis vectors, resulting in a rank of 2.\n\n*   **Cameroon**: This is a vertical tricolor of green, red, and yellow, with a yellow star in the central red stripe. The rows containing the star are linearly independent from the rows without the star, leading to a rank of 2.\n\n*   **Egypt**: A horizontal tricolor of red, white, and black, with the Eagle of Saladin on the central white stripe. The presence of the eagle creates a second linearly independent row pattern in addition to the uniform stripes (which are all linearly dependent on each other), resulting in a rank of 2.\n\n*   **Ghana**: The flag is a horizontal tricolor of red, yellow, and green, with a black star on the central yellow stripe. Similar to Egypt, the star introduces a second linearly independent pattern, giving the flag a rank of 2.\n\n*   **Lesotho**: This flag has three horizontal stripes of blue, white, and green, with a black *mokorotlo* (Basotho hat) in the center of the white stripe. The hat emblem creates a second linearly independent row pattern, resulting in a rank of 2.\n\n*   **Libya**: A horizontal tricolor of red, black, and green, with a white star and crescent on the central (and wider) black stripe. The emblem on the black stripe introduces a second linearly independent row pattern, giving a rank of 2.\n\n*   **Madagascar**: The flag has a vertical white band at the hoist and two horizontal bands of red and green. This design creates two different row patterns (white and red; white and green), which are linearly independent.\n\n*   **Malawi**: A horizontal tricolor of black, red, and green, with a red rising sun emblem on the top black stripe. The emblem creates a second linearly independent row pattern, resulting in a rank of 2.\n\n*   **Mauritania**: The flag has a green field with a gold crescent and star, and red bands at the top and bottom. The plain red rows are linearly dependent on the plain green rows, but the rows with the crescent and star create a second linearly independent pattern.\n\n*   **Morocco**: The flag features a red field with a green pentagram in the center. The rows containing the green pentagram are linearly independent from the plain red rows, resulting in a rank of 2.\n\n*   **Niger**: A horizontal tricolor of orange, white, and green, with an orange circle in the center of the white stripe. The orange circle creates a second linearly independent row pattern, giving the flag a rank of 2.\n\n*   **Rwanda**: This flag has horizontal stripes of blue, yellow, and green, with a yellow sun in the top-right corner on the blue stripe. The sun emblem creates a new row pattern that is linearly independent from the plain stripes, resulting in a rank of 2.\n\n*   **Senegal**: A vertical tricolor of green, yellow, and red, with a green star on the central yellow stripe. This is analogous to the flag of Cameroon, with the star creating a second linearly independent row pattern.\n\n*   **Somalia**: The flag consists of a light blue field with a white five-pointed star in the center. The rows that intersect the star are linearly independent from the plain blue rows, which results in a rank of 2.\n\n<<<Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Egypt, Ghana, Lesotho, Libya, Madagascar, Malawi, Mauritania, Morocco, Niger, Rwanda, Senegal, Somalia>>>"
