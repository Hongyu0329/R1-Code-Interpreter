    "I am unable to identify a Hollywood feature film produced by a major film studio in which a teenager rides a pink bike and pedals directly toward an oncoming car based on the information available.\n\nWhile the film \"Now and Then\" (1995), produced by New Line Cinema, prominently features four teenage girls and their bicycles as central to the story, there is no evidence in the detailed plot summaries or scene descriptions to suggest that any of the characters ride a pink bicycle or engage in a scene where they pedal directly toward an oncoming vehicle. The main characters are Samantha, Roberta (played by Christina Ricci), Teeny, and Chrissy. The film explores their friendship and adventures during the summer of 1970.\n\nSearches for scenes involving a pink bike and a confrontation with a car in other major Hollywood films have also not yielded any matching results. Therefore, I cannot confirm the existence of such a scene in a major feature film.\n\n<<<I am unable to answer this question.>>>"
