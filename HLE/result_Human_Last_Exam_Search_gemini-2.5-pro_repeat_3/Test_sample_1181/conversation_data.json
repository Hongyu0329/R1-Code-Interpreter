    "In Andrei Tarkovsky's 1972 film *Solaris*, it is the protagonist, Kris Kelvin, who is ashamed to miss the sound of rustling leaves on Earth.\n\nWhile on the space station orbiting the planet Solaris, Kris, despite appearing detached from nature, attaches strips of paper to the air vents in an attempt to replicate the sound of leaves rustling in the wind.
