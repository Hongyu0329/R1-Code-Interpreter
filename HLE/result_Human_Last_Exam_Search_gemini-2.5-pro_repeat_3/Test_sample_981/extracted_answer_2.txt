*   **Only property B:** None of the listed experiments use only property B.

*   **Both B and C:**
    *   **LHD (Large Helical Device):** LHD is a heliotron-type stellarator. It primarily uses the elongation and poloidal rotation of flux surfaces (property B) to create the magnetic twist. Although considered a planar-axis stellarator, it has a slight helical ripple in its magnetic axis which is crucial for its performance, meaning it also incorporates property (C). It does not rely on a net toroidal current (A).
    *   **Wendelstein 7-X:** This is a "Helias" (helical-axis advanced stellarator). It is explicitly designed to have a non-planar magnetic axis (property C) and complex, shaped flux surfaces that rotate poloidally (property B). It is designed to operate with virtually no toroidal current (A).
    *   **NCSX (National Compact Stellarator Experiment):** This was a compact stellarator designed with non-planar modular coils to create a quasi-axisymmetric magnetic field. This design inherently involves complex, rotating flux surfaces (property B) and a non-planar magnetic axis (property C). It was designed to operate without a significant toroidal current (A).

*   **A, B, and C:** One source suggests NCSX was designed with the flexibility to use all three properties, though its primary operational mode as a stellarator relies on B and C.

*   **A and B (Not explicitly asked for, but for clarity):**
    *   **Tokamaks:** These devices use a strong toroidal current (property A) to generate the main confining poloidal field. They also feature elongated, D-shaped flux surfaces (property B) for improved stability and confinement, but have a planar magnetic axis (no C).
    *   **Reversed Field Pinches (RFPs):** RFPs are similar to tokamaks in that they are toroidally symmetric and use a large toroidal current to create the magnetic field (property A). They also have shaped flux surfaces (property B), but a planar magnetic axis (no C).
