    "Integral surgery on a knot can only produce an integral homology 3-sphere if the surgery coefficient is +1 or -1. For a manifold to be an element of the homology cobordism group, it must be an integral homology 3-sphere. Therefore, we only need to consider +1 and -1 surgeries on knots with four or fewer crossings.\n\nThe knots with at most four crossings are:\n*   **Unknot (0₁):** Surgery on the unknot with coefficients +1 or -1 results in the standard 3-sphere (S³). The 3-sphere represents the trivial element of the homology cobordism group.\n*   **Trefoil Knot (3₁):** This is the simplest non-trivial knot and it is chiral, meaning it is distinct from its mirror image. We consider both the right-handed and left-handed trefoils.\n    *   **Right-handed trefoil:** -1 surgery on the right-handed trefoil produces the Poincaré homology sphere. The Poincaré sphere generates a ℤ summand in the homology cobordism group and is therefore a non-trivial element. In contrast, +1 surgery on the right-handed trefoil results in a manifold that is homology cobordant to S³, representing the trivial element.\n    *   **Left-handed trefoil:** The results are reversed. +1 surgery produces the Poincaré homology sphere (a non-trivial element), while -1 surgery yields the trivial element.\n*   **Figure-eight Knot (4₁):** This is the only knot with a crossing number of four. The figure-eight knot has a signature of 0. Manifolds created by any integral surgery on the figure-eight knot bound rational homology balls, which implies they are homology cobordant to S³. Thus, they represent the trivial element in the homology cobordism group.\n\nCounting the distinct elements generated:\n1.  **The trivial element:** This is produced by surgery on the unknot, the figure-eight knot, +1 surgery on the right-handed trefoil, and -1 surgery on the left-handed trefoil.\n2.  **The non-trivial element represented by the Poincaré homology sphere:** This is produced by -1 surgery on the right-handed trefoil and +1 surgery on the left-handed trefoil.\n\nIn total, two distinct elements of the homology cobordism group can be represented by integral surgery on a knot with at most four crossings.\n\n<<<2>>>"
