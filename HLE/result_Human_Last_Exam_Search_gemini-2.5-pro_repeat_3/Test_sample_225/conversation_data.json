    "For a Lissajous curve defined by x(t) = cos(at) and y(t) = sin(bt), where 'a' and 'b' are integers, a self-intersection point occurs when the same coordinates are produced for two different values of t in the interval [0, 2π). The number of self-intersection points can be determined by specific formulas depending on the parity of 'a' and 'b'.\n\nIn this case, the curve is given by (cos(9t), sin(5t)), so a = 9 and b = 5. Both 'a' and 'b' are odd integers.\n\nFor Lissajous curves where both 'a' and 'b' are odd and coprime (the greatest common divisor of a and b is 1), the number of self-intersection points is given by the formula:\nNumber of self-intersections = (a - 1)(b - 1) / 2\n\nHere, a = 9 and b = 5. They are coprime since their only common positive divisor is 1. Applying the formula:\nNumber of self-intersections = (9 - 1)(5 - 1) / 2\n= 8 * 4 / 2\n= 32 / 2\n= 16\n\nThus, the curve has 16 self-intersection points. This formula is applicable for \"non-degenerate\" Lissajous curves, and the given curve falls into this category.\n\n<<<16>>>For a Lissajous curve defined by x(t) = cos(at) and y(t) = sin(bt), where 'a' and 'b' are integers, a self-intersection point occurs when the same coordinates are produced for two different values of t in the interval [0, 2π).
