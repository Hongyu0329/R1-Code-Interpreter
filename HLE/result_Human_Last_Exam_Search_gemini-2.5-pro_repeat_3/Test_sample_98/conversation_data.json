    "An icosahedron is a polyhedron with 20 faces, 30 edges, and 12 vertices. When it is standing on one of its triangular faces, it has a corresponding parallel triangular face at the top. Due to its symmetry, when the icosahedron is half-filled with water, the water surface will be a horizontal plane that is exactly halfway between the bottom and top faces.\n\nThe shape of the water surface is the cross-section of the icosahedron created by this horizontal mid-plane. The plane intersects six of the icosahedron's faces. The resulting shape of this cross-section is a hexagon. Because the cutting plane is a plane of symmetry of the icosahedron in this orientation, the resulting hexagonal shape of the water surface is a regular hexagon.\n\n<<<A regular hexagon>>>"
