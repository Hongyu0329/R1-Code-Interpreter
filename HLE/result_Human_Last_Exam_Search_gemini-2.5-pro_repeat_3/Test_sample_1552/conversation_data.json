    "The second coefficient in the heat kernel expansion of the spectral action for a massless gauged Dirac spinor field, often denoted as the Seeley-DeWitt coefficient $a_2$, is a local geometric invariant that plays a crucial role in determining the Yang-Mills part of the spectral action. For a Dirac operator $D_A$ coupled to a gauge field $A$ on a four-dimensional Riemannian manifold, the heat kernel of its square, $D_A^2$, has an asymptotic expansion for small 'time' $t$:\n\n$Tr(e^{-tD_A^2}) \\sim \\frac{1}{(4\\pi t)^2} \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} t^n \\int_M a_n(x) dvol(x)$\n\nThe coefficient $a_2(x)$ is a density that can be calculated using the Lichnerowicz formula and standard heat kernel techniques.\n\nThe square of the gauged Dirac operator can be expressed as a generalized Laplacian operator of the form $-\\Delta - E$, where $\\Delta$ is the Bochner Laplacian constructed from the full covariant derivative (including the spin and gauge connections) and $E$ is an endomorphism term. The formula for the $a_2$ coefficient for such an operator is well-established in the literature.\n\nBy identifying the relevant terms and performing the trace over the spinor and gauge group indices, the portion of the $a_2$ coefficient density that depends on the gauge field strength, $F_{\\mu\\nu}$, for a single massless Dirac spinor field is found to be:\n\n$-\\frac{1}{6} \\text{Tr}(F_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu})$\n\nHere, $F_{\\mu\\nu}$ is the field strength tensor of the gauge field, and the trace, $\\text{Tr}$, is taken over the representation of the gauge group. This result is consistent with calculations for a Dirac fermion, which can be thought of as composed of two Weyl fermions, with each contributing $-\\frac{1}{12} \\text{Tr}(F_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu})$ to the coefficient.\n\nThis term is fundamental as its integral, when multiplied by the appropriate moment of the test function from the spectral action definition, gives rise to the Yang-Mills action functional for the gauge field.\n\n<<<$- \\frac{1}{6} \\text{Tr}(F_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu})$>>>"
