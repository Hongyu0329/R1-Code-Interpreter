    "A smooth quintic hypersurface $X$ can be interpreted in two ways based on the ambient space, which is specified as $\\mathbb{CP}^3$ in the prompt. However, the term \"quintic threefold\" commonly refers to a quintic hypersurface in $\\mathbb{CP}^4$. Let's analyze both interpretations.\n\n### Interpretation 1: $X$ is a smooth quintic hypersurface in $\\mathbb{CP}^4$ (a quintic threefold)\n\nThis is the most common interpretation in algebraic geometry and string theory, where the \"quintic threefold\" is a primary example of a Calabi-Yau manifold.\n\n1.  **Topological Preliminaries**:\n    *   Let $X$ be a smooth hypersurface of degree 5 in $\\mathbb{CP}^4$. It is a complex manifold of dimension 3 (a real manifold of dimension 6).\n    *   The **Lefschetz Hyperplane Theorem** relates the homotopy groups of $X$ to those of the ambient space $\\mathbb{CP}^4$. It implies that the inclusion map $i: X \\to \\mathbb{CP}^4$ induces isomorphisms $\\pi_k(X) \\cong \\pi_k(\\mathbb{CP}^4)$ for $k < \\dim_{\\mathbb{C}}(X) - 1 = 3 - 1 = 2$.\n    *   The homotopy groups of $\\mathbb{CP}^4$ are known: $\\pi_1(\\mathbb{CP}^4) = 0$ and $\\pi_2(\\mathbb{CP}^4) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n    *   Therefore, for the quintic threefold $X$, we have $\\pi_1(X) \\cong \\pi_1(\\mathbb{CP}^4) = 0$ (it is simply connected) and the Lefschetz theorem also implies $\\pi_2(X) \\cong \\pi_2(\\mathbb{CP}^4) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n2.  **Homology Groups**:\n    *   From the Lefschetz theorem, $H_2(X; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong H_2(\\mathbb{CP}^4; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$, so its second Betti number is $b_2(X)=1$.\n    *   The third Betti number, $b_3(X)$, can be computed from the Hodge diamond of a quintic threefold, which is a standard result. The Hodge numbers are $h^{3,0}=1, h^{2,1}=101, h^{1,2}=101, h^{0,3}=1$. The third Betti number is the sum: $b_3(X) = h^{3,0} + h^{2,1} + h^{1,2} + h^{0,3} = 1 + 101 + 101 + 1 = 204$. For a smooth hypersurface, the third homology group $H_3(X; \\mathbb{Z})$ is known to be torsion-free, so $H_3(X; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^{204}$.\n\n3.  **Calculating the Rank of $\\pi_3(X)$**:\n    *   To relate the homotopy groups to homology groups, we use the **Hurewicz theorem** and the **Whitehead tower**.\n    *   Since $X$ is simply connected ($\\pi_1(X)=0$) but not 2-connected ($\\pi_2(X)\\cong\\mathbb{Z}$), we cannot directly apply the simple version of the Hurewicz theorem for $\\pi_3$.\n    *   We can construct the Whitehead tower for $X$. Let $X_2$ be the 2-connected cover of $X$, which is the fiber of the map $X \\to K(\\pi_2(X), 2)$. A more direct construction involves a fibration $K(\\pi_2(X), 1) \\to X_2 \\to X$. Since $\\pi_2(X) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$, the fiber is $K(\\mathbb{Z}, 1)$, which is homotopically equivalent to a circle $S^1$.\n    *   The long exact sequence in homotopy for the fibration $S^1 \\to X_2 \\to X$ shows that $\\pi_k(X_2) \\cong \\pi_k(X)$ for $k \\ge 3$. Thus, $\\pi_3(X_2) \\cong \\pi_3(X)$.\n    *   Since $X_2$ is 2-connected (both $\\pi_1(X_2)$ and $\\pi_2(X_2)$ are trivial), the Hurewicz theorem states that $\\pi_3(X_2) \\cong H_3(X_2; \\mathbb{Z})$.\n    *   The homology of $X_2$ can be related to the homology of $X$ using the Serre spectral sequence for the fibration $S^1 \\to X_2 \\to X$. This sequence gives rise to a short exact sequence of groups:\n        $0 \\to H_3(X; \\mathbb{Z}) \\to H_3(X_2; \\mathbb{Z}) \\to H_2(X; \\mathbb{Z}) \\to 0$.\n    *   This means that the rank of $H_3(X_2; \\mathbb{Z})$ is the sum of the ranks of the other two groups.\n    *   The rank of $\\pi_3(X)$ is therefore:\n        $\\text{rank}(\\pi_3(X)) = \\text{rank}(\\pi_3(X_2)) = \\text{rank}(H_3(X_2; \\mathbb{Z}))$\n        $\\text{rank}(\\pi_3(X)) = \\text{rank}(H_3(X; \\mathbb{Z})) + \\text{rank}(H_2(X; \\mathbb{Z}))$\n        $\\text{rank}(\\pi_3(X)) = 204 + 1 = 205$.\n\n### Interpretation 2: $X$ is a smooth quintic hypersurface in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$ (a surface)\n\nIf we take the prompt literally, $X$ is a smooth surface of degree 5 in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$.\n\n1.  **Topological and Homological Properties**:\n    *   $X$ is a complex surface (real dimension 4).\n    *   By the Lefschetz Hyperplane Theorem, $\\pi_1(X) \\cong \\pi_1(\\mathbb{CP}^3) = 0$, so $X$ is simply connected.\n    *   Since $X$ is simply connected, the Hurewicz theorem implies that $\\pi_2(X) \\cong H_2(X; \\mathbb{Z})$.\n    *   The Betti numbers can be calculated using formulas from algebraic geometry. The Euler characteristic is $\\chi(X) = 55$, and since $b_0=1, b_1=b_3=0, b_4=1$, we find $b_2(X)=53$.\n    *   The third homology group is trivial: $H_3(X; \\mathbb{Z})=0$.\n\n2.  **Calculating the Rank of $\\pi_3(X)$**:\n    *   The rational homotopy groups $\\pi_k(X) \\otimes \\mathbb{Q}$ are determined by the rational cohomology algebra of $X$.\n    *   Since $X$ is a smooth projective variety, it is a formal space. For a simply connected formal space, rational homotopy theory shows that if $H^3(X; \\mathbb{Q})=0$, then the rational third homotopy group $\\pi_3(X) \\otimes \\mathbb{Q}$ must also be zero.\n    *   The rank of an abelian group $G$ is the dimension of the vector space $G \\otimes \\mathbb{Q}$.\n    *   Since $\\pi_3(X) \\otimes \\mathbb{Q} = 0$, the rank of $\\pi_3(X)$ must be 0. This implies that $\\pi_3(X)$ is a torsion group.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe phrasing of the question is ambiguous. However, the term \"quintic\" in algebraic geometry very often implies the famous quintic threefold in $\\mathbb{CP}^4$. Under this standard interpretation, the rank is 205. If the question is taken literally, the rank is 0. Given the context of such questions, the first interpretation is more probable.\n\nFinal Answer based on the standard interpretation of a \"quintic threefold\" residing in $\\mathbb{CP}^4$.\n\n<<<205>>>"
