    "After Mount Olympus, the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the context of the *Iliad* is **Mount Ida** on the island of Crete, with an elevation of 2,456 meters (8,058 feet).\n\nSeveral mountains are mentioned in the *Iliad* and its surrounding mythology, each playing a role in the epic's narrative and the world of the ancient Greeks. Here are the most notable ones, ranked by height:\n\n1.  **Mount Ida (Crete):** The highest mountain on Crete, Mount Ida, stands at 2,456 meters (8,058 feet). In Greek mythology, it is renowned as the birthplace of Zeus, where he was hidden from his father, Cronus. While the *Iliad* more frequently refers to the Trojan Mount Ida, the name \"Ida\" itself, meaning \"wooded hill,\" is deeply rooted in Minoan and Greek mythology.\n\n2.  **Mount Athos:** Located on the Chalcidice peninsula in northern Greece, Mount Athos has a peak that reaches 2,033 meters (6,670 feet). Homer mentions Mount Athos in the *Iliad*. According to mythology, the mountain was formed when the giant Athos threw a massive rock at the god Poseidon during the Gigantomachy.\n\n3.  **Mount Ida (Turkey):** This mountain, also known as Kazdağı, is located in northwestern Turkey, southeast of the ruins of Troy. Its highest peak is approximately 1,774 meters (5,820 feet). This is the Mount Ida from which the gods, particularly Zeus, are said to have watched the Trojan War. It is frequently mentioned throughout the *Iliad* as a significant setting.\n\n4.  **Mount Pelion:** Situated in Thessaly, Greece, Mount Pelion's highest summit is 1,624 meters (5,328 feet). In the *Iliad*, it is mentioned as the source of the wood for Achilles' formidable spear, which was a gift from the centaur Chiron.\n\n5.  **Mount Saos (Fengari) on Samothrace:** The highest peak on the island of Samothrace, Mount Saos (also called Fengari), reaches an elevation of 1,611 meters (5,285 feet). According to the *Iliad*, the sea god Poseidon watched the events of the Trojan War from this mountain.\n\nWhile the Mount Ida in Turkey plays a more direct narrative role in the *Iliad*, the Cretan Mount Ida is the tallest of these historically and mythologically significant mountains.\n\n<<<Mount Ida (Crete)>>>"
