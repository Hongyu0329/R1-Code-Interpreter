    "The left-hand trefoil knot has 2 grid diagrams with a minimal grid number, considered up to translation and rotation.\n\nThe trefoil knot, also known as knot 3_1, has a minimal grid number of 3. This means the smallest square grid on which it can be represented is 3x3. Within this minimal grid size, there are a total of 12 distinct grid diagrams when considering translations.\n\nThese 12 diagrams are evenly split between the two chiral forms of the trefoil knot. Six of these diagrams represent the right-handed trefoil, and the other six represent the left-handed trefoil.\n\nThe question requires considering the diagrams \"up to translation and rotation.\" When rotational symmetry is taken into account, the six diagrams for the left-handed trefoil are found to belong to two distinct classes. In other words, the six diagrams can be grouped into two sets, where the diagrams within each set are just rotations of each other. Therefore, there are 2 unique grid diagrams for the left-handed trefoil knot under these equivalences.\n\n<<<B>>>"
