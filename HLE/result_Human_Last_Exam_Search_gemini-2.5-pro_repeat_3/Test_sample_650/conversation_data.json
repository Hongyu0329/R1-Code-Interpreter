    "To determine the computational time complexity of the IMAG(n, c) algorithm, we analyze the number of fundamental operations performed as a function of the input size.\n\n### Algorithm Breakdown\n\nThe algorithm consists of three main parts:\n1.  **Initialization (Step 1):** A fixed number of basic operations (assignments, division, multiplication, subtraction) are performed. These are:\n    *   `i := 0`\n    *   `x := n`\n    *   `q := ⌊x/c⌋`\n    *   `a₀ := x - qc`\n    Assuming that for numbers that fit into a computer's word size, these arithmetic operations take constant time, this step has a time complexity of O(1).\n\n2.  **The `while` loop (Step 2):** This is the core of the algorithm. The loop continues as long as `q > 0`. Let's analyze the number of iterations.\n    *   The value of `q` is initialized to `⌊n/c⌋`.\n    *   Inside the loop, `x` takes the value of the previous `q`, and the new `q` is calculated as `⌊x/c⌋`.\n    *   Effectively, the value controlling the loop (`q`) is divided by `c` in each iteration. The sequence of values for `q` is approximately `n/c`, `n/c²`, `n/c³`, and so on.\n    *   The loop terminates when `q` becomes 0. This occurs when the value being divided, which started at `n`, becomes less than `c`. The number of times you can divide `n` by `c` until the result is less than 1 is given by the logarithm `log_c(n)`.\n    *   Therefore, the number of iterations of the `while` loop is proportional to `log_c(n)`.\n    *   Within each iteration of the loop, a constant number of basic operations are performed (`i := i + 1`, `x := q`, `q := ⌊x/c⌋`, `aᵢ := x - qc`). Each of these takes O(1) time.\n    *   Thus, the total time complexity of the loop is the number of iterations multiplied by the time per iteration, which is `O(log_c(n)) * O(1) = O(log_c(n))`.\n\n3.  **Return (Step 3):** Returning the result is a single operation, which takes O(1) time.\n\n### Overall Complexity\n\nThe total time complexity of the algorithm is the sum of the complexities of its parts:\n`T(n) = O(1) (initialization) + O(log_c(n)) (loop) + O(1) (return)`\n`T(n) = O(log_c(n))`\n\nUsing the change of base formula for logarithms (`log_c(n) = log(n) / log(c)`), we can express the complexity in terms of the natural logarithm (or any other base). Since `c` is a constant greater than or equal to 2, `log(c)` is also a constant. In Big O notation, constant factors are ignored. Therefore, the complexity can be simplified to `O(log n)`.\n\nThe time complexity of the algorithm is logarithmic with respect to the value of the input `n`.\n\n<<<O(log n)>>>"
