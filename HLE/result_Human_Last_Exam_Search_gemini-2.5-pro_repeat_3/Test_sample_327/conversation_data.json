    "To represent the number $\\frac{13}{16}$ in Red-Blue Hackenbush, we use its binary representation and the principle of game addition. In combinatorial game theory, the value of a collection of disjoint game positions is the sum of their individual values.\n\nFirst, we express the number $\\frac{13}{16}$ as a sum of fractions whose denominators are powers of two. This is equivalent to finding its binary representation:\n$\\frac{13}{16} = \\frac{8}{16} + \\frac{4}{16} + \\frac{1}{16} = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{16}$\n\nThis means the Hackenbush representation for $\\frac{13}{16}$ is the disjoint sum of the games representing $\\frac{1}{2}$, $\\frac{1}{4}$, and $\\frac{1}{16}$.\n\nThe standard construction for a number of the form $\\frac{1}{2^k}$ (for k > 0) is a single stalk. The value $\\frac{1}{2}$ is represented by a game whose options are 0 for the Left player (Red) and 1 for the Right player (Blue), which is written as {0|1}. This is constructed as a red edge connected to the ground, with a single blue edge stacked on top of it.\n\n*   **Game for $\\frac{1}{2}$**: This corresponds to k=1. It is a stalk made of 1 red piece at the base and 1 blue piece on top. This requires 2 pieces.\n\nThe value $\\frac{1}{4}$ is represented by the game $\\{0 | \\frac{1}{2}\\}$. This is constructed by placing a blue edge on top of the game for $\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\n*   **Game for $\\frac{1}{4}$**: This corresponds to k=2. It is a stalk made of 1 red piece at the base and 2 blue pieces on top. This requires 3 pieces.\n\nGenerally, the game for $\\frac{1}{2^k}$ is a stalk consisting of one red piece at the base and *k* blue pieces stacked on top.\n\n*   **Game for $\\frac{1}{16}$**: This corresponds to k=4. It is a stalk made of 1 red piece at the base and 4 blue pieces on top. This requires 5 pieces.\n\nTo get the representation for $\\frac{13}{16}$, we place these three stalks side-by-side, all connected to the ground. The total number of pieces is the sum of the pieces in each stalk:\n*   Total red pieces = 1 (from $\\frac{1}{2}$) + 1 (from $\\frac{1}{4}$) + 1 (from $\\frac{1}{16}$) = 3 red pieces.\n*   Total blue pieces = 1 (from $\\frac{1}{2}$) + 2 (from $\\frac{1}{4}$) + 4 (from $\\frac{1}{16}$) = 7 blue pieces.\n\nThe total number of pieces needed is the sum of the red and blue pieces:\nTotal pieces = 3 + 7 = 10.\n\n<<<10>>>"
