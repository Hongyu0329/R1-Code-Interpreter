The iterative application of the local median filter on a binary image causes the edges to evolve in a process analogous to mean curvature flow. This results in the smoothing of sharp corners and the shrinking of any closed shapes. As the number of iterations approaches infinity, these shapes will shrink until they disappear, causing the image to converge to a single uniform color (either entirely black or entirely white), unless it contains perfectly straight edges that span the entire image grid.
