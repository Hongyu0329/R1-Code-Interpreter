    "The number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams of order 2n for processes in quantum electrodynamics (QED) is a well-studied problem in physics and mathematics. The quantity `a(n)` corresponds to the number of these diagrams at a given order of perturbation theory. For the case of `a(3)`, we are looking for the number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams of order 2 * 3 = 6.\n\nThese numbers are generated by a function whose series expansion coefficients correspond to `a(n)`. According to the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS), the generating function for the number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams in QED can be expressed as a series in terms of the squared coupling constant.\n\nThe series is given by:\n`1 + x + 7x^2 + 72x^3 + 891x^4 + ...`\n\nIn this expansion, the term `x^n` corresponds to the order `2n`. Therefore, `a(n)` is the coefficient of `x^n`.\n- For n=0 (order 0), there is 1 diagram.\n- For n=1 (order 2), there is 1 diagram.\n- For n=2 (order 4), there are 7 diagrams.\n- For n=3 (order 6), there are 72 diagrams.\n\nThus, a(3) is the coefficient of xÂ³, which is 72.\n\n<<<72>>>"
