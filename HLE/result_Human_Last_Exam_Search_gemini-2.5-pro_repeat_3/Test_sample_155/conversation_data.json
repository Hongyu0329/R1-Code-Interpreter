    "This puzzle is a visual brain teaser where the encoded word is formed by the arrangement of the letter 't'. The 'b's and spaces act as the background. This type of puzzle is designed to be solved by mapping the characters onto a grid and observing the resulting image.\n\nBy plotting the 't' characters from the `verbatim` block onto a grid that respects the spacing and line breaks, a distinct shape emerges. The 't's represent \"on\" pixels, and the 'b's represent \"off\" pixels.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the character positions on a grid:\n\n*   **Line 1**: `t`'s appear at columns 1, 7, 9, 11, and 13.\n*   **Line 5**: A `t` appears at column 1.\n*   **Line 7**: `t`'s are located at columns 1, 5, and 7.\n*   **Lines 10 and 11**: A `t` appears at column 19 on both lines.\n*   **Line 13**: `t`'s are positioned at columns 5, 7, 9, 11, and 17.\n\nWhen these coordinates are plotted, they form a large, stylized representation of a single letter. The resulting image is the word encoded in the puzzle.\n\n<<<GHOST>>>"
