    "Based on a close analysis of their song structures, the Beatles song that most prominently starts with a progression from the tonic to the minor fifth chord is **\"I Me Mine\"**.\n\nThe song is in the key of A minor. The tonic chord (i) is therefore A minor. The fifth degree of the A natural minor scale is E, making the minor fifth chord (v) an E minor. The verse of \"I Me Mine\" is structured around a distinct waltz-time progression that moves from A minor to E minor, clearly establishing the \"jump\" from the tonic to the minor fifth chord as its core harmonic movement.\n\nWhile other songs feature interesting chord progressions, \"I Me Mine\" is the clearest example of a Beatles song founded on this specific harmonic shift from the very beginning of its main section.\n\n<<<I Me Mine>>>"
