    "As of August 2022, the single known integer value that completes the sequence 24663, 35005, 119261, 196219, 211770, 227296 is **35791**.\n\nThis sequence is related to a mathematical puzzle concerning the representation of numbers as the sum of three cubes. Specifically, the problem is to find integer solutions (x, y, z) to the Diophantine equation x³ + y³ + z³ = k for a given integer k.\n\nIt has been conjectured that a number *k* can be written as the sum of three cubes if and only if *k* is not of the form 9n ± 4. The numbers in the provided sequence are values of *k* for which solutions have been found. The final number, 35791, was a previously unsolved case for which a solution was found around August 2022.\n\nThe solution for k = 35791 is:\n35791 = (-22165)³ + (-18485)³ + 25281³\n\n<<<35791>>>"
