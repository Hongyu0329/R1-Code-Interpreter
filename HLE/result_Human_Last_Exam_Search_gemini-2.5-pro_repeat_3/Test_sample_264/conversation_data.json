    "The volume of the intersection of the two cubes is 1/8.\n\nHere is a step-by-step explanation of how to arrive at this answer:\n\n**1. Define the Cubes and the Shift**\n\n*   Let the first cube (Cube 1) be a unit cube with one corner at the origin (0,0,0) and the opposite corner at (1,1,1). Its boundaries are defined by:\n    *   0 ≤ x ≤ 1\n    *   0 ≤ y ≤ 1\n    *   0 ≤ z ≤ 1\n*   The main diagonal of this cube is the line segment connecting the corners (0,0,0) and (1,1,1). The vector representing this diagonal is (1, 1, 1).\n*   The second cube (Cube 2) is identical to the first but is shifted \"by 1/2 along the main diagonal.\" This is interpreted as a shift by a vector that is half of the main diagonal vector. Therefore, the shift vector is (1/2) * (1, 1, 1) = (1/2, 1/2, 1/2).\n*   Applying this shift to Cube 1, the boundaries of Cube 2 are:\n    *   0 + 1/2 ≤ x ≤ 1 + 1/2  =>  1/2 ≤ x ≤ 3/2\n    *   0 + 1/2 ≤ y ≤ 1 + 1/2  =>  1/2 ≤ y ≤ 3/2\n    *   0 + 1/2 ≤ z ≤ 1 + 1/2  =>  1/2 ≤ z ≤ 3/2\n\n**2. Determine the Intersection**\n\nThe intersection of the two cubes is the region where a point satisfies the boundary conditions for both cubes. For each axis, we find the overlapping range:\n\n*   **x-axis:** The overlap between and [1/2, 3/2] is [1/2, 1].\n*   **y-axis:** The overlap between and [1/2, 3/2] is [1/2, 1].\n*   **z-axis:** The overlap between and [1/2, 3/2] is [1/2, 1].\n\nThis method of finding the intersection of two axis-aligned boxes is a standard approach in geometry and computer graphics.\n\n**3. Calculate the Volume of the Intersection**\n\nThe resulting intersection is a smaller cube with its boundaries defined by:\n*   1/2 ≤ x ≤ 1\n*   1/2 ≤ y ≤ 1\n*   1/2 ≤ z ≤ 1\n\nThe side length of this new cube is the difference between the upper and lower bounds for each axis, which is 1 - 1/2 = 1/2.\n\nThe volume of a cube is the side length cubed. Therefore, the volume of the intersection is:\n\nVolume = (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/8.\n\n<<<1/8>>>"
