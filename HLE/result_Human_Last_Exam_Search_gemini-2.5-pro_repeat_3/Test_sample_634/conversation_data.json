    "The greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of two polynomial matrices P1 and P2 is a polynomial matrix G that is a right divisor of both P1 and P2, and any other common right divisor of P1 and P2 is also a right divisor of G. The GCRD can be found using a procedure analogous to the Euclidean algorithm for scalar polynomials, which involves elementary row operations on a stacked matrix formed from P1 and P2.\n\nThe given polynomial matrices are:\nP1 = [s^2 + s, -s; -s^2 - 1, s^2]\nP2 = [s, 0; -s - 1, 1]\n\nTo find the GCRD, we can form a stacked matrix M = [P1; P2] and reduce it to a row-echelon form using elementary row operations. The non-zero rows of the resulting matrix will form the GCRD.\n\n1.  **Form the stacked matrix M:**\n    M =\n    [ s^2 + s,  -s   ]\n    [ -s^2 - 1, s^2  ]\n    [    s    ,   0   ]\n    [  -s - 1 ,   1   ]\n\n2.  **Perform elementary row operations to simplify the matrix.** The goal is to obtain an upper triangular form.\n\n    *   Swap R1 and R3:\n        [    s    ,   0   ]\n        [ -s^2 - 1, s^2  ]\n        [ s^2 + s,  -s   ]\n        [  -s - 1 ,   1   ]\n\n    *   R2 ← R2 + s*R1\n    *   R3 ← R3 - (s+1)*R1\n    *   R4 ← R4 + R1\n        [ s,   0    ]\n        [ -1,  s^2  ]\n        [ 0,   -s   ]\n        [ -1,   1    ]\n\n    *   Swap R1 and R2, then negate the new R1:\n        [ 1,  -s^2  ]\n        [ s,    0   ]\n        [ 0,   -s   ]\n        [ -1,   1    ]\n\n    *   R2 ← R2 - s*R1\n    *   R4 ← R4 + R1\n        [ 1,  -s^2  ]\n        [ 0,   s^3  ]\n        [ 0,   -s   ]\n        [ 0,  1-s^2 ]\n\n    *   Now, focus on the submatrix formed by rows 2, 3, and 4. Swap R2 and R3, and negate the new R2:\n        [ 1,  -s^2  ]\n        [ 0,    s   ]\n        [ 0,   s^3  ]\n        [ 0,  1-s^2 ]\n\n    *   R3 ← R3 - s^2*R2\n    *   R4 ← R4 + s*R2\n        [ 1,  -s^2  ]\n        [ 0,    s   ]\n        [ 0,    0   ]\n        [ 0,    1   ]\n\n    *   Swap R2 and R4:\n        [ 1,  -s^2  ]\n        [ 0,    1   ]\n        [ 0,    s   ]\n        [ 0,    0   ]\n\n    *   R1 ← R1 + s^2*R2\n    *   R3 ← R3 - s*R2\n        [ 1,    0   ]\n        [ 0,    1   ]\n        [ 0,    0   ]\n        [ 0,    0   ]\n\n3.  **Identify the GCRD.** The non-zero part of the reduced matrix is the GCRD. In this case, the resulting matrix is the identity matrix.\n\nThis result indicates that the matrices P1 and P2 are right co-prime.\n\nAn alternative check is to verify if the stacked matrix M(s) has full rank (rank 2) for all complex values of s. The rank of M(s) is 2 unless all of its 2x2 minors are zero for some s.\nThe minor formed by rows 3 and 4 is det(P2) = s. This is zero only at s = 0.\nThe minor formed by rows 2 and 4 is det([-s^2-1, s^2; -s-1, 1]) = -s^2 - 1 - s^2(-s-1) = s^3 - 1. This is zero at s = 1 and the complex cube roots of unity.\nSince there is no value of s for which both of these minors (and all other minors) are simultaneously zero, the rank of the stacked matrix is always 2. This confirms that P1 and P2 are right co-prime.\n\nThe greatest common right divisor is unique up to left-multiplication by a unimodular matrix (a polynomial matrix with a non-zero, constant determinant). The simplest such matrix is the identity matrix.\n\n<<<\n[1, 0;\n0, 1]\n>>>"
