Let $r_A(n)$ be the fraction of red liquid in cup A after $n$ repetitions of the procedure, and $r_B(n)$ be the fraction of red liquid in cup B. Initially, at $n=0$, we have $r_A(0) = 1$ and $r_B(0) = 0$. The volume in each cup is assumed to be 1.

The procedure involves moving a $\delta$-fraction of liquid between the cups. This is modeled as a simultaneous exchange. After one step, the fraction of red liquid in cup A is what remains from A, $(1-\delta)r_A(n)$, plus what arrives from B, $\delta r_B(n)$. This gives the following system of recurrence relations:
$r_A(n+1) = (1-\delta)r_A(n) + \delta r_B(n)$
$r_B(n+1) = \delta r_A(n) + (1-\delta)r_B(n)$

Since the total amount of red liquid is conserved, we have $r_A(n) + r_B(n) = 1$ for all $n$. Substituting $r_B(n) = 1 - r_A(n)$ into the first equation gives a single recurrence for $r_A(n)$:
$r_A(n+1) = (1-\delta)r_A(n) + \delta(1 - r_A(n)) = (1-2\delta)r_A(n) + \delta$

This is a linear first-order recurrence relation. The equilibrium state (the fixed point) is $r^* = 1/2$. The solution to this recurrence with the initial condition $r_A(0)=1$ is:
$r_A(n) = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2}(1-2\delta)^n$

Consequently, the fraction of red liquid in cup B is:
$r_B(n) = 1 - r_A(n) = \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{2}(1-2\delta)^n$

The liquids are considered "the same" if they differ by at most an $\epsilon$-fraction of their contents. This means the absolute difference in the concentration of red liquid (and equivalently, white liquid) between the two cups must be no more than $\epsilon$.
$|r_A(n) - r_B(n)| \le \epsilon$

Substituting the solutions for $r_A(n)$ and $r_B(n)$:
$|\left(\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2}(1-2\delta)^n\right) - \left(\frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{2}(1-2\delta)^n\right)| \le \epsilon$
$|(1-2\delta)^n| \le \epsilon$
$|1-2\delta|^n \le \epsilon$

To find the number of repetitions, $n$, we solve this inequality.

**Case 1: $\delta = 1/2$**
If $\delta = 1/2$, then $|1-2\delta| = 0$. After one step ($n=1$), the difference is 0, which is less than or equal to any $\epsilon \in (0, 1)$. Thus, for this specific case, the number of repetitions needed is 1.

**Case 2: $\delta \neq 1/2$**
Since $\delta \in (0,1)$, we have $0 < |1-2\delta| < 1$. We can take the natural logarithm of both sides of the inequality:
$n \ln(|1-2\delta|) \le \ln(\epsilon)$

Because $|1-2\delta| < 1$, its natural logarithm is negative. Therefore, when we divide by $\ln(|1-2\delta|)$, we must reverse the inequality sign:
$n \ge \frac{\ln(\epsilon)}{\ln(|1-2\delta|)}$

Since $n$ must be an integer, we need the smallest integer that satisfies this condition, which is the ceiling of the expression on the right.

The number of times the procedure must be repeated, $n$, is given by:
For $\delta = 1/2$:
$n = 1$

For $\delta \neq 1/2$:
$n = \left\lceil \frac{\ln(\epsilon)}{\ln(|1-2\delta|)} \right\rceil$
