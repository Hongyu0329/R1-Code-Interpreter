    "To determine the possible degrees of normal field extensions $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ such that $\\mathbb{Q} \\subsetneq L \\subsetneq K$, we first need to understand the structure of the splitting field $K$ and its Galois group over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n### 1. Factoring the Polynomial\nThe given polynomial is $P(x) = x^7 - 2x^5 - 9x^3 + 3x^2 + 18x - 6$. We can factor this polynomial by grouping terms:\n$P(x) = (x^7 - 2x^5) - (9x^3 - 18x) + (3x^2 - 6)$\nThis initial grouping is not the most helpful. A more insightful grouping reveals a common factor of $(x^2-2)$:\n$P(x) = x(x^6 - 2x^4 - 9x^2 + 18) + 3(x^2 - 2)$\nLet's factor the term in the first parenthesis:\n$x^6 - 2x^4 - 9x^2 + 18 = x^4(x^2 - 2) - 9(x^2 - 2) = (x^4 - 9)(x^2 - 2)$\nSubstituting this back, we get:\n$P(x) = x(x^4 - 9)(x^2 - 2) + 3(x^2 - 2)$\nNow, we can factor out the term $(x^2 - 2)$:\n$P(x) = (x(x^4 - 9) + 3)(x^2 - 2) = (x^5 - 9x + 3)(x^2 - 2)$\n\nSo, the polynomial $P(x)$ is a product of two polynomials: $f(x) = x^2 - 2$ and $g(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$.\n\n### 2. Galois Groups of the Factors\nThe splitting field $K$ of $P(x)$ is the compositum of the splitting fields of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$. Let's denote these as $K_f$ and $K_g$ respectively.\n\n*   **For $f(x) = x^2 - 2$**: The roots are $\\pm\\sqrt{2}$. The splitting field is $K_f = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. This is a degree 2 extension, and its Galois group is $G_f = \\text{Gal}(K_f/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong C_2$ (the cyclic group of order 2).\n\n*   **For $g(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$**:\n    *   **Irreducibility**: By Eisenstein's criterion with the prime $p=3$, since 3 divides all coefficients except the leading one, and $3^2=9$ does not divide the constant term 3, the polynomial $g(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n    *   **Galois Group**: Since $g(x)$ is an irreducible polynomial of degree 5, its Galois group $G_g$ is a subgroup of $S_5$. To determine which subgroup, we analyze the roots of $g(x)$. The derivative is $g'(x) = 5x^4 - 9$, which has two real roots, meaning $g(x)$ has exactly two critical points. This implies $g(x)$ has three real roots and two complex conjugate roots. A 5-cycle exists because the group acts transitively on the five roots of an irreducible quintic. The complex conjugation provides a transposition. A 5-cycle and a transposition together generate the entire symmetric group $S_5$. Thus, the Galois group of $g(x)$ is $G_g = \\text{Gal}(K_g/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong S_5$.\n\n### 3. The Galois Group of the Splitting Field K\nThe Galois group of $K$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$, denoted by $G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$, is a subgroup of the direct product $G_f \\times G_g \\cong C_2 \\times S_5$. The structure of $G$ depends on the intersection of the fields $K_f$ and $K_g$. The intersection $K_f \\cap K_g$ is a normal extension of $\\mathbb{Q}$. As $K_f = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ is the only non-trivial intermediate field, the intersection is either $\\mathbb{Q}$ or $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n\nThe intersection is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ if and only if $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ is a subfield of $K_g$. The only quadratic subfield of $K_g$ is the one associated with the square root of the discriminant of $g(x)$. The discriminant of $x^5+ax+b$ is $\\Delta = (-1)^{n(n-1)/2}(n^n b^{n-1} + (-1)^{n-1}(n-1)^{n-1}a^n)$. For $g(x)$, we have $n=5, a=-9, b=3$.\n$\\Delta = 5^5 \\cdot 3^4 + 4^4 \\cdot (-9)^5 = 3125 \\cdot 81 - 256 \\cdot 59049 = 253125 - 15116544 = -14,863,419$.\nThe quadratic subfield of $K_g$ is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-14,863,419})$. Since this is not $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, the intersection $K_f \\cap K_g = \\mathbb{Q}$.\nTherefore, the Galois group of $K$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is the direct product of the individual Galois groups:\n$G \\cong C_2 \\times S_5$.\nThe order of $G$ is $|G| = |C_2| \\cdot |S_5| = 2 \\cdot 120 = 240$.\n\n### 4. Normal Subgroups and Degrees of Extensions\nAccording to the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory, normal extensions $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ contained in $K$ correspond to normal subgroups of $G$. The degree of such an extension $[L:\\mathbb{Q}]$ is the index of the corresponding normal subgroup $H$ in $G$, i.e., $[G:H]$. We are looking for degrees of extensions where $\\mathbb{Q} \\subsetneq L \\subsetneq K$, which corresponds to proper, non-trivial normal subgroups of $G=C_2 \\times S_5$.\n\nThe normal subgroups of $S_5$ are $\\{e\\}$, $A_5$, and $S_5$. The normal subgroups of $C_2$ are $\\{e\\}$ and $C_2$. The normal subgroups of the direct product $C_2 \\times S_5$ are:\n1.  **Product subgroups**:\n    *   $C_2 \\times \\{e\\}$: The index is $240/2 = 120$.\n    *   $\\{e\\} \\times A_5$: The index is $240/60 = 4$.\n    *   $\\{e\\} \\times S_5$: The index is $240/120 = 2$.\n    *   $C_2 \\times A_5$: The index is $240/120 = 2$.\n\n2.  **\"Skew\" subgroups**: There can be other normal subgroups. A full analysis reveals one other normal subgroup, which is of the form $N_{sgn} = \\{(\\text{sgn}(\\sigma), \\sigma) \\mid \\sigma \\in S_5\\}$, where sgn is the sign homomorphism. The order of this subgroup is 120, and its index is $240/120 = 2$.\n\nThe proper, non-trivial normal subgroups of $C_2 \\times S_5$ lead to the following indices:\n*   Index of $C_2 \\times \\{e\\}$ is 120.\n*   Index of $\\{e\\} \\times A_5$ is 4.\n*   Index of $\\{e\\} \\times S_5$ is 2.\n*   Index of $C_2 \\times A_5$ is 2.\n*   Index of $N_{sgn}$ is 2.\n\nThe set of possible degrees for these normal extensions $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is the set of these indices.\n\nThe possible degrees are 2, 4, and 120.\n\n<<<>>>"
