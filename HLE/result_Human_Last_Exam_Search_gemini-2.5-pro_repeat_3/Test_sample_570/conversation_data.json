    "I am unable to answer this question. The problem of finding the minimal area of a convex domain that intersects all lines with the equation px+qy=1, where p and q are coprime integers, is a specialized topic in geometry. Despite multiple search attempts using various keywords related to convex geometry, integer lattices, and line arrangements, no direct solution or relevant literature providing the specific minimal area could be found within the scope of the available tools. This suggests that the problem might be a niche research question, possibly unsolved or with a solution that is not widely documented in easily accessible sources.\n\nThe search results provided information on related but distinct mathematical problems, such as Moser's worm problem, properties of convex polygons, and the geometry of numbers. However, none of these results directly address the specific conditions and constraints of the user's question. Without a definitive source, it is not possible to provide an accurate and factual answer.\n\nTherefore, the minimal area for this specific problem is not available through the conducted searches.\n\n<<<I am unable to answer this question.>>>"
