    "Hypothetically, a perfluoronanocar would contain 274 fluorine atoms. This is based on the molecular formula of a nanocar, which is C430H274O12.\n\nThe term \"perfluoro\" indicates that all of the hydrogen atoms in the original molecule have been replaced by fluorine atoms. Therefore, the number of fluorine atoms in a perfluoronanocar would be equal to the number of hydrogen atoms in a standard nanocar. The given molecular formula shows 274 hydrogen atoms, meaning a perfluorinated version would have 274 fluorine atoms.\n\nIt is worth noting that different designs and molecular formulas for nanocars exist. For instance, a nanocar dubbed the \"Green Buggy\" has the chemical formula C184H116. In this case, a perfluorinated version would contain 116 fluorine atoms. However, the most cited nanocar structure has the formula with 274 hydrogen atoms.\n\n<<<274>>>"
