    "Here is the step-by-step derivation to find the 4-point DFT.\n\n### 1. Define the Sequence\n\nLet the 8-point sequence be denoted by `y(n)`:\n`y(n) = {x(0), h(0), x(1), h(1), x(2), h(2), x(3), h(3)}`\n\nWe are asked to find the 4-point Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) of this 8-point sequence. Let's call this `Z(k)`.\n\n### 2. Relate N-point DFT to M-point DFT\n\nThe N-point DFT of a longer M-point sequence (where M > N) can be found using the aliasing property in the time domain, or equivalently, by sampling in the frequency domain.\n\nLet `Y(k)` be the 8-point DFT of the 8-point sequence `y(n)`. The 4-point DFT of `y(n)`, which we call `Z(k)`, is obtained by sampling the even-indexed components of the 8-point DFT `Y(k)`.\n\n`Z(k) = Y(2k)` for `k = 0, 1, 2, 3`.\n\nSo, we need to find `Y(0)`, `Y(2)`, `Y(4)`, and `Y(6)`.\n\n### 3. Use the Decimation-in-Time FFT Property\n\nThe 8-point sequence `y(n)` is formed by interleaving the 4-point sequences `x(n)` and `h(n)`.\n*   The even-indexed terms of `y(n)` are `y(2m) = x(m)` for `m = 0, 1, 2, 3`.\n*   The odd-indexed terms of `y(n)` are `y(2m+1) = h(m)` for `m = 0, 1, 2, 3`.\n\nThe 8-point DFT `Y(k)` of `y(n)` can be calculated from the 4-point DFTs of its even and odd parts (`X(k)` and `H(k)`, respectively) using the following formulas derived from the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm:\n\nFor `k = 0, 1, 2, 3`:\n`Y(k) = X(k) + W_8^k * H(k)`\n`Y(k+4) = X(k) - W_8^k * H(k)`\n\nwhere `W_N^k = e^(-j*2*pi*k/N)` is the DFT twiddle factor.\n\n### 4. Calculate the Required Components of Y(k)\n\nWe need to find `Y(0)`, `Y(2)`, `Y(4)`, and `Y(6)`.\n\n*   **For Y(0):** Use the first formula with `k=0`.\n    `Y(0) = X(0) + W_8^0 * H(0)`\n\n*   **For Y(2):** Use the first formula with `k=2`.\n    `Y(2) = X(2) + W_8^2 * H(2)`\n\n*   **For Y(4):** Use the second formula with `k=0`.\n    `Y(0+4) = Y(4) = X(0) - W_8^0 * H(0)`\n\n*   **For Y(6):** Use the second formula with `k=2`.\n    `Y(2+4) = Y(6) = X(2) - W_8^2 * H(2)`\n\n### 5. Substitute Values and Compute\n\n**Given DFTs:**\n*   `X(k) = [1, j, -1, -j]`\n*   `H(k) = [0, 1+j, 1, 1-j]`\n\n**Twiddle Factors:**\n*   `W_8^0 = e^0 = 1`\n*   `W_8^2 = e^(-j * 2 * pi * 2 / 8) = e^(-j * pi / 2) = -j`\n\nNow, let's compute the values:\n\n*   **Z(0) = Y(0)**\n    `Y(0) = X(0) + W_8^0 * H(0) = 1 + (1)(0) = 1`\n\n*   **Z(1) = Y(2)**\n    `Y(2) = X(2) + W_8^2 * H(2) = -1 + (-j)(1) = -1 - j`\n\n*   **Z(2) = Y(4)**\n    `Y(4) = X(0) - W_8^0 * H(0) = 1 - (1)(0) = 1`\n\n*   **Z(3) = Y(6)**\n    `Y(6) = X(2) - W_8^2 * H(2) = -1 - (-j)(1) = -1 + j`\n\n### 6. Final Result\n\nCombining these results, the 4-point DFT `Z(k)` is:\n`Z(k) = {Y(0), Y(2), Y(4), Y(6)}`\n\n<<<[1, -1-j, 1, -1+j]>>>"
