    "**The names of the Prophets in the poem 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam' (The Creed of the Laymen) by Sayyid Ahmad al-Marzuqi are mentioned in a sequence of four bayts (verses).**\n\nDue to variations in the numbering of the poem across different publications, it is most accurate to identify the verses by their content rather than by a specific number. The section detailing the names of the Prophets begins with the verse starting \"هم أدم إدريس نوح هود مع\" and concludes with the verse ending \"عيسى وطه خاتم دعه غيا\".\n\nThe specific verses are as follows:\n\n**هُمُ آدَمٌ إِدْرِيسُ نُوحٌ هُودٌ مَعَ * صَالِحْ وَإِبْرَاهِيمُ كُلٌّ مُتَّبَعْ**\n(They are Adam, Idris, Nuh, Hud, along with Salih and Ibrahim, each to be followed)\n\n**لُوطٌ وَإِسْمَاعِيلُ إِسْحَاقُ كَذَا * يَعْقُوبُ يُوسُفُ وَأَيُّوبُ احْتَذَى**\n(Lut and Isma'il, Ishaq as well, Ya'qub, Yusuf, and Ayyub who followed)\n\n**شُعَيْبُ هَارُونُ وَمُوسَى وَالْيَسَعْ * ذُو الْكِفْلِ دَاوُدُ سُلَيْمَانُ اتَّبَعْ**\n(Shu'ayb, Harun, and Musa, and al-Yasa', Dhul-Kifl, Dawud, Sulayman who followed)\n\n**إِلْيَاسُ يُونُسُ زَكَرِيَّا يَحْيَى * عِيسَى وَطَهَ خَاتَمٌ دَعْ غَيَّا**\n(Ilyas, Yunus, Zakariyya, Yahya, 'Isa, and Taha [an appellation for Prophet Muhammad], the seal, leave deviation)\n\nThese four bayts dedicated to listing the names of the twenty-five prophets mentioned in the Quran follow a preceding verse that introduces the topic: \"تَفْصِيلُ خَمْسَةٍ وَعِشْرِينَ لَزِمْ * كُلَّ مُكَلَّفٍ فَحَقِّقْ وَاغْتَنِمْ\" (The detailed account of twenty-five is necessary for every accountable person, so verify and seize the opportunity)."
