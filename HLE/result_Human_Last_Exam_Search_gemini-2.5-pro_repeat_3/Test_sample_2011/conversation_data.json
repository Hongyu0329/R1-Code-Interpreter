    "To determine the maximum possible number of different clique sizes that can simultaneously appear as induced subgraphs of a single graph with n = 128 vertices, we first need to understand the key terms.\n\n*   **Graph:** A collection of vertices and edges, where each edge connects a pair of vertices. The graph in question has 128 vertices.\n*   **Clique:** A subset of vertices in a graph where every two distinct vertices are connected by an edge. A clique of size *k* is often denoted as Kₖ.\n*   **Induced Subgraph:** For a subset of vertices, the induced subgraph consists of those vertices and *all* the edges from the original graph that connect pairs of vertices within that subset. The question specifies that we are looking for induced subgraphs that are themselves cliques. This is the standard definition of a clique in a graph.\n\nLet G be a graph with 128 vertices. We are looking for the maximum size of the set S = {k | G has an induced clique of size k}.\n\nConsider a graph G that contains an induced clique of a certain maximum size, let's call it k_max. This means there is a set of k_max vertices where every vertex is connected to every other vertex in the set. Let this set of vertices be C. The subgraph induced by C is a complete graph, Kₖ_max.\n\nNow, if we take any subset C' of C with size k (where 1 ≤ k < k_max), the subgraph induced by C' will also be a complete graph, Kₖ. This is because all vertices in C' are part of C, and since all vertices in C are interconnected, all vertices in C' must also be interconnected.\n\nThis leads to a crucial insight: if a graph has an induced clique of size k_max, it necessarily has induced cliques of all integer sizes from 1 to k_max. Consequently, the number of different clique sizes in a graph is equal to the size of its largest clique. This size is known in graph theory as the clique number, denoted by ω(G).\n\nThe problem is now reduced to finding the maximum possible clique number for a graph with 128 vertices. The size of any clique in a graph cannot exceed the total number of vertices in the graph. For a graph with n = 128 vertices, the clique number ω(G) can be at most 128.\n\nTo see if this maximum can be achieved, we can consider the complete graph on 128 vertices, denoted K₁₂₈. In a complete graph, every pair of distinct vertices is connected by an edge.\n\nIn the K₁₂₈ graph:\n*   The entire set of 128 vertices forms a clique of size 128.\n*   By the logic above, since there is a clique of size 128, there must also be induced cliques of all sizes from 1 to 128. To form an induced clique of any size k (where 1 ≤ k ≤ 128), we can simply select any k vertices from the graph.\n\nThus, the complete graph K₁₂₈ contains induced cliques of sizes {1, 2, 3, ..., 128}. The number of different clique sizes is 128.\n\nSince the number of possible clique sizes cannot exceed 128, and we have found a graph that achieves this number, the maximum possible number of different clique sizes is 128.\n\n<<<128>>>"
