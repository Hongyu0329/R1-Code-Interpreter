    "In a 2008 performance of the *Don Quixote* Act I variation, Natalia Osipova, then a soloist with the Bolshoi Ballet, did not perform any single-turn pirouettes en dehors from the fifth position.\n\nAnalysis of video footage from a 2008 performance reveals that the choreography for Kitri's Act I variation as performed by Osipova featured a series of rapid piqué turns rather than single pirouettes from the fifth position. While she was celebrated for her powerful turns and high jumps in the role of Kitri, this specific type of pirouette was not part of the showcased solo.\n\nHer performances of *Don Quixote* from that period were widely acclaimed for their energy and technical brilliance, often described as breathtaking and full of sparkling personality. Reviews from around that time frequently mention her remarkable turning ability, including multiple pirouettes and impressive fouetté sequences in other acts of the ballet. However, the specific variation in Act I highlighted other aspects of her technical skills.\n\n<<<0>>>"
