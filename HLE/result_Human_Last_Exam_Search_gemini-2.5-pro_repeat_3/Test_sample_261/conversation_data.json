    "The archimandrite of the Pskov-Caves Monastery from 1730 to 1731 was Markell (Radyshevsky).\n\nMarkell was appointed archimandrite of the Pskov-Caves Monastery in 1724. However, his tenure was tumultuous. In 1725, he was accused of stealing valuables from the monastery, which initiated a prolonged legal case. This evolved into a major conflict where he accused the influential Archbishop Feofan Prokopovich of heresy. As a result of these events, Markell was held under guard and was likely not physically present or governing the monastery for parts of his tenure, including the years 1730-1731, before being formally sentenced to exile in another monastery in 1732. Despite his probable absence, historical records list him as the archimandrite during this period until his official replacement.\n\n<<<F>>>"
