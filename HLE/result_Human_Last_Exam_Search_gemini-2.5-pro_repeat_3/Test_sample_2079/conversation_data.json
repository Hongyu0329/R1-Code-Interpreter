    "An exact identification of the judge of Bártfa (now Bardejov) in the year 1461 is not available in the consulted historical sources.\n\nBártfa, a free royal town, had the privilege of electing its own judge (richtár) and town council since 1376. While historical records confirm a functioning town administration during this period, a specific list of judges for each year is not readily accessible in online and digitized documents. For instance, in 1461, the town council of Nowy Sącz in Poland sent a letter to the town council of Bártfa regarding a dispute, indicating the presence of a formal town leadership.\n\nResearch into the town's history mentions that during the latter half of the 15th century, a relatively small circle of individuals held positions of power. Over a 50-year period, only ten different people served as the town's judge. This suggests that the name of the judge for 1461 would be recorded in the town's archives. However, without access to these specific, likely non-digitized, archival records, the name of the individual holding the office of judge in that particular year remains unconfirmed.\n\nOne source mentions a \"Stenzl György\" as a \"városbíró\" (the Hungarian term for judge) at the beginning of the 15th century, but a precise year is not provided. Other prominent figures, such as Juraj Winter, served as judge, but in a later period during the 17th century.\n\nTherefore, while it is certain that Bártfa had a judge in 1461, their name is not found in the available historical literature and online records.\n\n<<<The judge of Bártfa (now Bardejov) in 1461 cannot be definitively identified from the available search results.>>>"
