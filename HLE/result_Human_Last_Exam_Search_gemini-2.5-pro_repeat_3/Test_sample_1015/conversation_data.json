    "A key distinction between the Vaganova and Balanchine methods in the execution of a *cambré derrière* lies in the placement of the hips. While other elements such as arm and head placement, speed, and the degree of the backbend also show stylistic variations, the use of the hips is a fundamental difference in the mechanics and aesthetic of the movement.\n\nIn the Vaganova method, which emphasizes a stable core and precise, controlled movements, the hips are generally kept square and aligned with the shoulders. The backbend is initiated from the upper and middle back, with the goal of creating a long, elegant curve without disturbing the placement of the hips and legs. The *port de bras* (carriage of the arms) and the movement of the head are strictly codified and coordinated with the backbend. For instance, in the third *port de bras*, the focus remains on the downstage forearm as the dancer bends backward, ensuring the upper body works in a specific, contained manner.\n\nConversely, the Balanchine method is characterized by its speed, dynamism, and a more daring and expressive use of the body to create exciting lines. This style often features a deeper *cambré* and introduces a \"swaying\" or released hip. This deliberate use of the hip allows for a greater range of motion and a more dramatic, three-dimensional quality in the upper body. This approach is consistent with Balanchine's broader aesthetic, which includes open arabesques and a stylized use of the head and arms to create a more modern and visually impactful look.\n\nTherefore, the placement of the hip is a primary distinguishing factor. The Vaganova method maintains a more classical, stable hip alignment, while the Balanchine method often incorporates a released hip to achieve a deeper and more dynamic backbend.\n\n<<<B>>>"
