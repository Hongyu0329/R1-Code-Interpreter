Based on the evidence, CAR T cells manufactured with interleukin-15 are predicted to exhibit a more robust and sustained release of effector cytokines, such as IFN-γ and TNF-α, compared to those manufactured without it. This is due to IL-15's role in promoting a more persistent, less-differentiated stem cell memory phenotype, leading to enhanced anti-tumor activity. While this heightened cytokine response is crucial for therapeutic efficacy, it may also contribute to an increased risk of cytokine release syndrome.
