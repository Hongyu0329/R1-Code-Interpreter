    "Based on the research, adult Raphidiopterans (snakeflies) have a varied diet.\n\n*   **Predation on Aphids:** Many sources confirm that adult snakeflies are predators of soft-bodied insects, with aphids being specifically and frequently mentioned. Adult Raphidiidae, a family within the order, show a distinct preference for aphids.\n*   **Nectar and Pollen Consumption:** Several sources also state that adult snakeflies feed on pollen and, in some cases, nectar. Pollen has been found in the guts of dissected adults, although it's not always clear if it is a required food source. Some species that are not predatory are noted to feed on nectar, pollen, or honeydew.\n*   **Specific Plants:** The options include plants native to New Zealand (Māhoe, Karamū, Totara). Raphidioptera are not native to the Southern Hemisphere, although there was a failed attempt to introduce a species to New Zealand for pest control in the early 20th century. Therefore, feeding on Māhoe pollen or Karamū leaf tissue in the wild is not recorded. However, the option \"Totara Aphids\" refers to an insect prey type, which is consistent with their diet, even if the specific combination is context-dependent.\n*   **Other Food Sources:** There is no evidence they feed on fungus or leaf tissue. [C, D] They are primarily carnivorous or feed on pollen/nectar.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe evidence strongly supports that adult Raphidiopterans have been recorded feeding on both aphids (like Totara Aphids) and nectar.\n\n*   **A. Nectar:** Supported by multiple sources.\n*   **E. Totara Aphids:** As they are well-documented aphid predators, this is a valid food source.\n\nTherefore, the most comprehensive and accurate answer is the combination of A and E.\n\n<<<F>>>"
