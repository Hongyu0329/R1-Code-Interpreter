The general representation for the infinitesimal transformation on `x` is:

`ξ(t, x) = A x e^{k₁t} + B x + C e^{k₁t} + D`

where `A`, `B`, `C`, and `D` are arbitrary constants. This represents all possible forms for the infinitesimal transformation on the spatial variable `x` that leave the given differential equation invariant.
