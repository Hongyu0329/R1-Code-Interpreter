    "The space-time, double Fourier transform of the generalized pair correlation function is commonly called the **dynamic structure factor** in the nuclear criticality community. This term is also sometimes referred to as the scattering law or scattering function.\n\nThe generalized pair correlation function, often denoted as G(r,t), describes the probability of finding a particle at a position **r** at time **t**, given that another particle (or the same particle) was at the origin at time t=0. Its double Fourier transform with respect to space and time yields the dynamic structure factor, S(k,ω), where **k** is the wavevector (related to momentum transfer) and ω is the frequency (related to energy transfer).\n\nThis relationship is fundamental in the field of neutron scattering, a critical experimental technique in nuclear science and engineering. The dynamic structure factor is directly proportional to the double differential scattering cross-section, which is the quantity measured in inelastic neutron scattering experiments. Therefore, it provides crucial information about the microscopic dynamics and structure of the material being studied, which is essential for understanding neutron transport and behavior in a nuclear system.\n\n<<<dynamic structure factor>>>"
