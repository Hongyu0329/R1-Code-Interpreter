    "The cardinality of the set of continuous functions $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ that satisfy the equation $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$ is the cardinality of the continuum, denoted by $\\mathfrak{c}$ or $2^{\\aleph_0}$.\n\nHere is a summary of the reasoning:\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Properties of *f*\n\nFirst, we analyze the properties that any such continuous function $f$ must have.\n*   **Injectivity:** The function $g(x) = e^x$ is injective (one-to-one). If $f(x_1) = f(x_2)$, then $f(f(x_1)) = f(f(x_2))$, which implies $e^{x_1} = e^{x_2}$, so $x_1 = x_2$. Therefore, $f$ must be an injective function.\n*   **Monotonicity:** A continuous and injective function on $\\mathbb{R}$ must be strictly monotonic (either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing).\n\n### 2. Case 1: *f* is Strictly Decreasing\n\nIf $f$ is a strictly decreasing continuous function from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$, its graph must cross the line $y=x$. This can be shown by considering the function $h(x) = f(x) - x$. As $x \\to -\\infty$, $f(x)$ approaches some limit $L \\in (-\\infty, \\infty]$ and so $h(x) \\to +\\infty$. As $x \\to \\infty$, $f(x)$ approaches some limit $M \\in [-\\infty, \\infty)$ with $M<L$, so $h(x) \\to -\\infty$. By the Intermediate Value Theorem, there must be a point $c$ such that $h(c)=0$, which means $f(c)=c$.\n\nIf such a fixed point $c$ exists, then $f(f(c)) = f(c) = c$. From the original equation, this means $e^c = c$. However, the equation $e^c = c$ has no real solutions. This is a contradiction, so **no strictly decreasing continuous solutions exist**.\n\n### 3. Case 2: *f* is Strictly Increasing\n\nIf $f$ is strictly increasing, then $f(f(x))$ is also strictly increasing, which is consistent with $e^x$.\n*   If there were a point $x_0$ such that $f(x_0) \\le x_0$, then due to $f$ being strictly increasing, $f(f(x_0)) \\le f(x_0) \\le x_0$. This would mean $e^{x_0} \\le x_0$, which is never true for any real $x$. Thus, we must have $f(x) > x$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n*   This implies $f(f(x)) > f(x) > x$, which is consistent with $e^x > x$.\n\n### 4. Constructing Solutions and Determining Cardinality\n\nThe problem of finding such a function $f$ is known as finding the functional square root (or half-iterate) of the exponential function. This problem was famously solved by Hellmuth Kneser in 1950. The existence of solutions is non-trivial, and it turns out there are infinitely many.\n\nA standard method to analyze the number of solutions is to use a conjugacy argument. The equation $f(f(x)) = e^x$ can be transformed into a simpler functional equation. Let $f(x) = \\phi(F(\\phi^{-1}(x)))$, where $\\phi$ is an invertible function. Then $f(f(x)) = \\phi(F(F(\\phi^{-1}(x))))$. If we can choose $\\phi$ such that the original problem is equivalent to finding $F$ for a simpler equation, we can count the solutions.\n\nBy conjugating with the logarithm function, the problem can be related to solving $F(F(y))=y+1$. More precisely, if one sets up the appropriate conjugacy $\\phi$ satisfying Abel's equation $\\phi(y+1) = e^{\\phi(y)}$, the problem reduces to finding solutions for $F(F(y))=y+1$.\n\nThe number of solutions can be determined by the degrees of freedom in constructing them:\n1.  **Existence of Solutions:** The construction of a single solution proves that the set is not empty. This can be done by defining the function on a specific interval and then extending it to all of $\\mathbb{R}$ using the properties of the exponential function.\n2.  **Number of Solutions:** The construction of these functions allows for choices at certain steps. For instance, one can choose an arbitrary continuous, strictly increasing bijection from an interval $[a, b]$ to $[b, e^a]$ (where $b$ itself is a choice within $(a, e^a)$).\n3.  **Cardinality of Choices:** The set of continuous functions on an interval has the cardinality of the continuum, $\\mathfrak{c}$. The freedom to choose such a function at the heart of the construction leads to a set of solutions with cardinality $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n4.  **Upper Bound:** The set of all continuous functions from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$ has cardinality $\\mathfrak{c}$. Therefore, the set of solutions cannot have a cardinality greater than $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n\nSince there are at least $\\mathfrak{c}$ solutions and at most $\\mathfrak{c}$ solutions, the cardinality of the set is exactly $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n\n<<<C>>>The cardinality of the set of continuous functions $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ that satisfy the equation $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$ is the cardinality of the continuum, denoted by $\\mathfrak{c}$ or $2^{\\aleph_0}$.\n\nHere is a summary of the reasoning:\n\n### 1.
