    "The exact value of the angle $\\alpha$ for the A($\\alpha$) stability of the BDF4 numerical scheme is given by:\n$\\alpha = \\arctan\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{3(23 + \\sqrt{2033})}{2}}\\right)$\n\nThe concept of A($\\alpha$)-stability is crucial for analyzing the behavior of numerical methods when applied to stiff ordinary differential equations. A numerical method is defined as A($\\alpha$)-stable, with $\\alpha \\in (0, \\pi/2]$, if its region of absolute stability contains the infinite sector $S_{\\alpha} = \\{ z \\in \\mathbb{C} : |\\arg(-z)| \\leq \\alpha, z \\neq 0 \\}$. The angle $\\alpha$ therefore represents the largest sector of the left half of the complex plane that is contained within the method's stability region.\n\nFor the Backward Differentiation Formula of order 4 (BDF4), the boundary of its stability region is a curve in the complex plane. The angle $\\alpha$ is the angle of the tangent line drawn from the origin to this curve. For many years, the value of this angle was known only through numerical approximation, with $\\alpha \\approx 73.35^\\circ$.\n\nIn 2019, Georgios Akrivis and Emmanouil Katsoprinakis were able to find the exact analytical expressions for the maximum angles of A($\\alpha$)-stability for BDF methods of orders 3 through 6. Their work showed that for BDF4, the square of the tangent of the stability angle, $\\tan^2(\\alpha)$, is a rational expression involving a specific algebraic number.\n\nSubsequently, in 2020, Martin J. Gander and Gerhard Wanner simplified the derivation and the final expressions using the computer algebra system Maple. Their work confirmed the findings of Akrivis and Katsoprinakis and presented the exact values in a more direct form. They showed that for BDF4, the expression for the tangent of the stability angle involves the square root of 2033.\n\nThe derivation involves parametrizing the boundary of the stability region and finding the maximum of the ratio of the imaginary part to the negative of the real part of the points on this boundary. This leads to solving a polynomial equation to find the point of tangency, which for BDF4 results in the expression involving $\\sqrt{2033}$.\n\n<<<$\\arctan\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{3(23 + \\sqrt{2033})}{2}}\\right)$>>>"
