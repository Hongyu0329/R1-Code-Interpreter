    "The major reduction product of di(perylene-3-yl) disulfide is perylene-3-thiol. This is because the reduction of a disulfide bond (R-S-S-R) cleaves the sulfur-sulfur bond and adds a hydrogen atom to each sulfur, resulting in two thiol molecules (R-SH).\n\nThe chemical structure of the product is perylene-3-thiol, which has the molecular formula C₂₀H₁₂S. To calculate the topological indices including hydrogen atoms, we must consider the full molecular graph:\n*   20 Carbon atoms\n*   1 Sulfur atom\n*   11 Hydrogen atoms attached to the perylene ring system\n*   1 Hydrogen atom attached to the sulfur atom\n\nThis results in a molecular graph with a total of 33 vertices.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of two well-known topological indices:\n\n1.  **Wiener Index (W):** This index is the sum of the lengths of the shortest paths between all non-ordered pairs of vertices in the graph.\n2.  **Szeged Index (Sz):** For each edge (u,v) in the graph, one calculates the number of vertices closer to u (nᵤ) and the number of vertices closer to v (nᵥ). The Szeged index is the sum of the products nᵤ * nᵥ over all edges in the graph.\n\nFor any graph that is not a tree, the Szeged index is greater than the Wiener index.\n\n**Calculation:**\nThe calculation of these indices for a complex, 33-vertex graph like perylene-3-thiol (including hydrogens) is a computationally intensive task. It requires:\n1.  Generating the adjacency matrix for the full 33-vertex graph of the molecule.\n2.  Using algorithms to compute the shortest path distance matrix between all 528 pairs of vertices for the Wiener index.\n3.  For the Szeged index, iterating through each edge and partitioning all 33 vertices to calculate the contributions for that edge.\n\nSuch calculations are typically performed using specialized computational chemistry or graph theory software and are beyond the scope of manual calculation or standard database lookup. The available scientific literature and search results do not contain pre-calculated Wiener or Szeged indices for perylene-3-thiol with the inclusion of hydrogen atoms.\n\nTherefore, while the procedure to find the Szeged/Wiener index ratio is well-defined, providing the precise numerical value is not possible without performing a dedicated computational analysis.\n\n<<<A precise numerical value for the Szeged/Wiener index ratio for the major reduction product of di(perylene-3-yl) disulfide (including H) cannot be provided without specialized computational software to analyze the 33-vertex molecular graph of perylene-3-thiol.>>>"
