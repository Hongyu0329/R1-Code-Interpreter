The one-step transformation of the probability distribution is given by $P_{t+1}(i) = \frac{1}{2} P_t((i-1) \pmod N) + \frac{1}{2} P_t((i+1) \pmod N)$. The transition probability matrix $\hat{A}$ is a circulant matrix with $A_{i, (i-1)\pmod N} = 1/2$ and $A_{i, (i+1)\pmod N} = 1/2$ and all other entries being zero. The eigenvectors of this matrix are shown to be vectors $v_n$ with components $(v_n)_j = e^{ij k_n}$ where $k_n = 2\pi n/N$ for $n = 0, 1, \dots, N-1$. The corresponding eigenvalues are $\lambda_n = \cos(2\pi n / N)$. The largest eigenvalue is $\lambda_0 = 1$, corresponding to the stationary distribution. The second-largest eigenvalue is $\lambda_1 = \lambda_{N-1} = \cos(2\pi/N)$. The rate of relaxation to the stationary distribution is determined by this second-largest eigenvalue, specifically by the spectral gap $1 - \cos(2\pi/N)$.
