    "To determine the smallest number $n$ for which a set $G$ of $n$ elements with a binary operation is not a group, we must first consider the definition of a group and what set sizes are permissible.\n\n### The Definition of a Group\n\nA group is a set $G$, combined with a binary operation $\\cdot$, that satisfies four properties:\n1.  **Closure:** For any two elements $a$ and $b$ in $G$, the result $a \\cdot b$ is also in $G$. The prompt assumes this by stating that $\\cdot$ is a binary operation on $G$.\n2.  **Associativity:** For all $a, b, c$ in $G$, the equation $(a \\cdot b) \\cdot c = a \\cdot (b \\cdot c)$ holds.\n3.  **Identity element:** There must be an element $e$ in $G$ such that for every element $a$ in $G$, the equation $e \\cdot a = a \\cdot e = a$ holds.\n4.  **Inverse element:** For each element $a$ in $G$, there must be an element $b$ in $G$ such that $a \\cdot b = b \\cdot a = e$, where $e$ is the identity element.\n\nCritically, most standard definitions of a group explicitly state that the set $G$ must be non-empty. The axiom requiring the existence of an identity element implies this, as a non-existent element cannot be found in an empty set.\n\n### Analyzing Possible Values of $n$\n\nLet's examine the possible sizes of the set $G$:\n\n*   **Case: $n=0$**\n    The set is the empty set, $G = \\emptyset$. A binary operation on $\\emptyset$ is a function from $\\emptyset \\times \\emptyset$ to $\\emptyset$, which is the empty function. The closure and associativity properties are vacuously true because there are no elements to test. However, the identity element axiom fails because there is no element $e$ in the empty set. Therefore, the empty set with its binary operation is not a group. If we were to ignore the non-empty requirement, $n=0$ would be the smallest number. However, the standard definition in group theory requires the set to be non-empty.\n\n*   **Case: $n=1$**\n    Let's consider a set with a single element, $G = \\{a\\}$. The only possible binary operation on this set is $a \\cdot a = a$. Let's check if this forms a group:\n    *   **Closure:** $a \\cdot a = a$, which is in $G$. Satisfied.\n    *   **Associativity:** $(a \\cdot a) \\cdot a = a \\cdot (a \\cdot a)$ becomes $a \\cdot a = a \\cdot a$. Satisfied.\n    *   **Identity Element:** The element $a$ acts as the identity, since $a \\cdot a = a$. Satisfied.\n    *   **Inverse Element:** The inverse of $a$ is $a$ itself, since $a \\cdot a = a$ (the identity element). Satisfied.\n    Since all axioms are satisfied, any set of size 1 with a binary operation forms a group (this is known as the trivial group). It is impossible to define a binary operation on a one-element set that results in a non-group structure.\n\n*   **Case: $n=2$**\n    Let's consider a set with two elements, $G = \\{a, b\\}$. We need to see if it's possible to define a binary operation $\\cdot$ that fails at least one of the group axioms (other than closure).\n    Consider the following operation: for any two elements $x, y \\in G$, let $x \\cdot y = a$.\n    Let's test the group axioms:\n    *   **Closure:** All results are $a$, which is in $G$. Satisfied.\n    *   **Associativity:** $(x \\cdot y) \\cdot z = a \\cdot z = a$. And $x \\cdot (y \\cdot z) = x \\cdot a = a$. The operation is associative.\n    *   **Identity Element:** We need an element $e$ such that $e \\cdot x = x$ for all $x \\in G$.\n        *   If we test $e=a$, then $a \\cdot b$ must be $b$. But our rule defines $a \\cdot b = a$. So $a$ is not the identity.\n        *   If we test $e=b$, then $b \\cdot a$ must be $a$. This part of the condition is met by our rule. However, $b \\cdot b$ must be $b$. Our rule defines $b \\cdot b = a$. So $b$ is not the identity either.\n    Since there is no identity element, this structure is not a group. This provides an example of a set of size 2 with a binary operation that is not a group.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the standard, non-empty definition of a group, we have:\n- For $n=1$, any set with a binary operation is always a group.\n- For $n=2$, it is possible to define a binary operation on a set that does not form a group.\n\nTherefore, the smallest number $n$ such that a set of $n$ elements can form a non-group is 2.\n\n<<<2>>>"
