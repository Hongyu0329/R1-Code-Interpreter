    "Based on the analysis of the board, there are two optimal moves for player 'O' to win as quickly as possible. Both moves create a situation where 'O' can win on their following turn, regardless of the opponent's move. Such a scenario is often created by setting up a double threat.\n\nThe two optimal moves are:\n\n**c4**\nPlacing a piece in column 'c' at row 4 (c4) creates a horizontal line of three 'O's (c4, d4, e4). This immediately threatens to win on the next turn by placing a piece at either b4 or f4. Since the opponent ('X') can only block one of these two spots in their turn, 'O' is guaranteed to win on the subsequent move.\n\n**f4**\nPlacing a piece in column 'f' at row 4 (f4) creates a horizontal line of three 'O's (d4, e4, f4). This threatens to win on the next turn by placing a piece at either c4 or g4. Similar to the first move, the opponent can only block one of these winning spots, guaranteeing a win for 'O' on the next turn.\n\nAdditionally, the move f4 also sets up a winning diagonal. Player 'O' has pieces at c6, d5, and e4. Placing a piece at f4 makes the f3 spot playable on the next turn for 'O', which would complete the diagonal and result in a win. Therefore, the move f4 creates multiple winning threats.\n\nBoth moves lead to a win for 'O' on their next turn, which is the fastest possible winning outcome from the current board state.\n\n<<<c4, f4>>>"
