# Let's use the standard one as it is more likely to be correct.
# Actually, the problem is more complex due to gamma correction.
# ROMM RGB uses a gamma of 1.8. sRGB is more complex.
# First, let's linearize the ROMM values.

# Let's try an online converter to verify, as the full process is complex.
# Using a known online converter (e.g., Bruce Lindbloom's calculator) is the most reliable way.

# 1) RGB(0, 0, 1) - Pure Blue in ROMM
# 2) RGB(0, 1, 0) - Pure Green in ROMM
# 3) RGB(0, 0.5, 0.6)
# 4) RGB(0.4, 0.5, 0.6)
# 5) RGB(1, 1, 1) - White

# Let's check the pure primaries. The primaries of ROMM RGB are outside the sRGB gamut, except for red.
# ROMM RGB Primaries (in CIE xy):
# Red: (0.7347, 0.2653)
# Green: (0.1596, 0.8404)
# Blue: (0.0366, -0.0001) - This is an imaginary primary.

# sRGB Primaries (in CIE xy):
# Red: (0.64, 0.33)
# Green: (0.30, 0.60)
# Blue: (0.15, 0.06)

# From this, the ROMM green (0,1,0) and blue (0,0,1) are definitely outside the sRGB gamut.
# Let's verify this with the conversion matrix.

# Let's apply the matrix to the linearized ROMM values.

# This simplified analysis shows that (1) and (2) are out of gamut.
# (3) and (4) appear to be in-gamut based on this linear check.
# (5) is white, which is a shared point between the color spaces and should be convertible.

# The pure green (0, 1, 0) and pure blue (0, 0, 1) in ROMM RGB are known to be highly saturated colors that fall outside the much smaller sRGB gamut.
# The color (0, 0.5, 0.6) is a mix of blue and green, but with lower saturation, making it more likely to be within the sRGB gamut.
# The color (0.4, 0.5, 0.6) is a desaturated color, close to a neutral gray, which is very likely to be within the sRGB gamut.
# The color (1, 1, 1) represents the white point, which is convertible between color spaces (though the exact white point might differ, D50 for ROMM and D65 for sRGB, the conversion handles this).

Therefore, the colors that cannot be represented are (1) and (2).
