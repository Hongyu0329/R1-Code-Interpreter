    "An \"all-or-nothing\" vaccine is a type of vaccine that provides complete protection to a portion of vaccinated individuals, while offering no protection to the rest. In this model, if a vaccine has an efficacy of, for example, 80%, it means that 80% of those vaccinated are fully immune, and the remaining 20% have no more protection than an unvaccinated person.\n\nVaccine efficacy (VE) is commonly calculated as 1 minus the relative risk (RR), where the relative risk can be the ratio of incidence rates between the vaccinated and unvaccinated groups (Incidence Rate Ratio or IRR). So, VE = 1 - IRR.\n\nIn an all-or-nothing scenario, the incidence rate in the vaccinated group is determined solely by the proportion of individuals for whom the vaccine did not provide protection. Let's say a fraction, *p*, of the vaccinated population is fully protected. The remaining fraction, 1-*p*, is still susceptible. The incidence rate in the vaccinated group (IRv) will be proportional to the force of infection (the rate at which susceptible individuals get infected) multiplied by this susceptible fraction (1-*p*). The incidence rate in the unvaccinated group (IRu) is proportional to the same force of infection, as the entire group is susceptible.\n\nTherefore:\n*   IRR = IRv / IRu = (1-*p*) / 1 = 1-*p*\n*   Vaccine Efficacy (calculated as 1 - IRR) = 1 - (1-*p*) = *p*\n\nThe \"per-exposure vaccine efficacy\" for an all-or-nothing vaccine is the proportion of vaccinated individuals who are rendered completely immune, which is *p*. Since the calculation of vaccine efficacy using the incidence rate ratio (1 - IRR) also results in *p*, the 1-incidence rate ratio correctly estimates the per-exposure vaccine efficacy for this type of vaccine.\n\nThis is in contrast to a \"leaky\" vaccine, where the vaccine provides partial protection to all recipients, reducing their risk per exposure by a certain percentage. In the case of a leaky vaccine, the relationship between 1-IRR and per-exposure efficacy can be more complex and may not always be a direct one-to-one estimation, especially over time.\n\n<<<C>>>"
