    "The search results confirm the initial analysis.\n\n1.  **Directed *ortho*-Metalation (DoM):** This is a well-established reaction where a directing metalation group (DMG) guides a strong base, typically an organolithium reagent, to deprotonate the aromatic ring at the position *ortho* (adjacent) to the DMG. The DMG coordinates to the lithium ion, bringing the base into proximity of the ortho proton and increasing its kinetic acidity.\n\n2.  **Directing Groups:** Both the tertiary amide group (`-CONEt₂`) and the tertiary amine group (`-NMe₂`) are known and effective DMGs. The N,N-diethylamide group is considered a very strong directing group.\n\n3.  **Synergistic Effect:** When two directing groups are located *meta* to each other on a benzene ring (at positions 1 and 3), they both direct metalation to the C2 position. This is referred to as a synergistic or cooperative effect, making the proton at C2 the most favorable site for deprotonation. In the starting material, N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide, the amide is at C1 and the dimethylamino group is at C3. Both direct lithiation to the C2 position.\n\n4.  **Reagents:** The combination of *sec*-BuLi (a strong alkyllithium base) and TMEDA (a chelating agent that enhances the base's reactivity) is a classic and powerful system for performing directed *ortho*-metalation reactions.\n\n5.  **Electrophilic Quench:** The aryllithium intermediate formed after deprotonation is a strong nucleophile. It readily reacts with electrophiles. Methyl iodide (`CH₃I`) is a common electrophile used to introduce a methyl group. The reaction proceeds via nucleophilic attack of the carbanion on the methyl group, displacing the iodide ion.\n\nBased on these principles, the reaction proceeds as follows:\n*   First, the N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide is deprotonated by *sec*-BuLi/TMEDA at the C2 position, which is *ortho* to both the amide and the dimethylamino directing groups.\n*   Second, the resulting aryllithium intermediate reacts with methyl iodide, which adds a methyl group to the C2 position.\n\nTherefore, the final product is N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide.\n\n<<<N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide>>>"
