    "**Radon was the rarest noble gas on Earth in 2002, measured as a percentage of all terrestrial matter.**\n\nRadon (Rn) is an extremely rare element due to its radioactive nature. Its most stable isotope, radon-222, has a very short half-life of just 3.8 days. This rapid decay means that despite being continuously generated from the radioactive decay of radium-226 found in rocks and soil, its overall abundance at any given moment is exceptionally low.\n\nThe concentration of radon in the Earth's atmosphere is minuscule, estimated to be around 1 part in 10^21, which is a concentration of 1 x 10<sup>-15</sup> parts per million (ppm) by volume. In the Earth's crust, its abundance is estimated at approximately 4 x 10<sup>-13</sup> milligrams per kilogram. When considering the total mass of the Earth (approximately 5.97 x 10<sup>24</sup> kg), radon's contribution is infinitesimally small.\n\nFor comparison, the second-rarest noble gas is xenon (Xe). While also scarce, xenon is a stable element. Its concentration in the atmosphere is about 0.087 parts per million by volume, which is many orders of magnitude greater than that of radon.\n\nThe scientific understanding of noble gas abundances was well-established by 2002, and the fundamental radioactive properties of radon that make it the rarest noble gas have not changed. Therefore, radon held this distinction in 2002.\n\n<<<Radon>>>"
