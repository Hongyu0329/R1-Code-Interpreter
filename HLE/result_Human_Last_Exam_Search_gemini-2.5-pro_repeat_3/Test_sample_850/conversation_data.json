    "There are four crystal classes that are achiral and non-enantiomorphic, yet still possess the necessary symmetry for optical activity. These are:\n\n*   **m** (monoclinic)\n*   **mm2** (orthorhombic)\n*   **4̅** (tetragonal)\n*   **4̅2m** (tetragonal)\n\nOptical activity is the ability of a substance to rotate the plane of polarized light. While this property is commonly associated with chiral molecules, which lack an internal plane of symmetry and are non-superimposable on their mirror images, certain achiral crystal structures can also exhibit this phenomenon.\n\nFor a crystal to be optically active, it must not have a center of inversion. The four crystal classes listed above—m (C<sub>s</sub>), mm2 (C<sub>2v</sub>), 4̅ (S<sub>4</sub>), and 4̅2m (D<sub>2d</sub>)—do not possess a center of inversion, which allows for optical activity. However, they do contain other symmetry elements, such as mirror planes or rotoinversion axes, which make them achiral.\n\nIt is important to note that while these crystal classes are non-polar, the observation of optical activity in them can be challenging because it is often overshadowed by birefringence (double refraction). Nevertheless, optical rotation has been experimentally confirmed in crystals belonging to these classes, such as in silver thiogallate (AgGaS<sub>2</sub>) which is in the 4̅2m class, and cadmium gallium sulfide (CdGa<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub>) which belongs to the 4̅ class."
