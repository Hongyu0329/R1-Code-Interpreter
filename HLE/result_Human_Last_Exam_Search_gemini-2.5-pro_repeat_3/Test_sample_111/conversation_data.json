    "Blanche of Lancaster, the first wife of John of Gaunt, died on September 12, 1368. She passed away at Tutbury Castle in Staffordshire, England, likely a victim of the plague.\n\nDuring that same year, Geoffrey Chaucer was traveling on the continent on \"the King's service.\" Historical records and timelines indicate he was likely in France. Blanche's husband, John of Gaunt, was also abroad in Picardy at the time of her death. Chaucer's famous poem, \"The Book of the Duchess,\" was written in her honor around 1369, commissioned by John of Gaunt.
