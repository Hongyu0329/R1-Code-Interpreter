**1. Amlodipine**
*   **Rationale:** Amlodipine is a long-acting dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker (CCB). CCBs are a first-line recommendation for hypertension in African American patients, according to major guidelines like the 2017 ACC/AHA guidelines. The initial pharmacologic approach for resistant hypertension typically includes a long-acting CCB. This medication addresses high blood pressure by relaxing blood vessels.

**2. Valsartan**
*   **Rationale:** Valsartan is an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB). For patients with hypertension and diabetes (MM's A1C is 6.7%), an ARB or an ACE inhibitor is recommended to protect kidney function. ARBs are often preferred over ACE inhibitors in Black patients due to a lower risk of side effects like cough and angioedema. This class of medication blocks the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, a key pathway in blood pressure regulation.

**3. Spironolactone**
*   **Rationale:** MM has resistant hypertension, defined as blood pressure above goal despite using three different medications. For this condition, adding a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA) like spironolactone is the recommended next step. The landmark PATHWAY-2 trial demonstrated that spironolactone was more effective at lowering blood pressure in patients with resistant hypertension compared to other add-on therapies like beta-blockers or alpha-blockers. Its effectiveness is thought to be due to its ability to counteract sodium retention, which is often a primary driver of resistant hypertension. MM has no contraindications, as her kidney function is normal (SCr = 0.9) and eplerenone (another MRA) is the only one she is unable to take.
