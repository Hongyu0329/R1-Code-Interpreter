    "To solve the equation $z\\cdot i=i^z$ for all $z\\in\\mathbb{C}$, we let $z = x+iy$ where $x,y \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nThe left side of the equation is:\n$z \\cdot i = (x+iy)i = xi + i^2y = -y + xi$.\n\nThe right side of the equation involves a complex exponent. The multi-valued complex logarithm is used here. We can write $i$ in exponential form as $e^{i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)}$ for any integer $k$.\n$i^z = i^{x+iy} = e^{(x+iy)\\ln(i)} = e^{(x+iy)i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)}$\n$i^z = e^{ix(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi) - y(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)}$\n$i^z = e^{-y(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)} \\cdot e^{ix(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)}$\nUsing Euler's formula, this becomes:\n$i^z = e^{-y(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)} \\left[ \\cos\\left(x\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi\\right)\\right) + i\\sin\\left(x\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi\\right)\\right) \\right]$\n\nEquating the real and imaginary parts of $-y+xi = i^z$:\n1.  $-y = e^{-y(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)} \\cos\\left(x\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi\\right)\\right)$\n2.  $x = e^{-y(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)} \\sin\\left(x\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi\\right)\\right)$\n\nWe analyze three cases for the nature of $z$.\n\n**Case 1: $z$ is a real number ($y=0$)**\nIf $y=0$, the equations simplify to:\n1.  $0 = \\cos\\left(x\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi\\right)\\right)$\n2.  $x = \\sin\\left(x\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi\\right)\\right)$\n\nFrom equation (1), for the cosine to be zero, its argument must be an odd multiple of $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\n$x\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi\\right) = \\frac{(2m+1)\\pi}{2}$ for some integer $m$.\n$x(1+4k) = 2m+1$.\n\nFrom equation (2), $x$ must be equal to the sine of this argument. The sine of an odd multiple of $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ can only be $1$ or $-1$.\n*   If $x=1$: The sine condition requires $\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi\\right) = 1$, which is true for all integers $k$. Checking with the cosine argument condition: $1 \\cdot (1+4k) = 2m+1 \\implies 4k=2m \\implies m=2k$. This is a valid relationship between integers. Thus, $z=1$ is a solution.\n*   If $x=-1$: The sine condition requires $\\sin\\left(-(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)\\right) = -1$, which is $-\\sin(\\frac{\\pi}{2}+2k\\pi)=-1$, also true for all integers $k$. Checking with the cosine argument condition: $-1 \\cdot (1+4k) = 2m+1 \\implies -1-4k=2m+1 \\implies m=-1-2k$. This is a valid relationship. Thus, $z=-1$ is a solution.\n\n**Case 2: $z$ is a purely imaginary number ($x=0$)**\nIf $x=0$, the equations become:\n1.  $-y = e^{-y(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)} \\cos(0) = e^{-y(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)}$\n2.  $0 = e^{-y(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)} \\sin(0) = 0$. This equation is always satisfied and provides no constraint on $y$.\n\nWe need to solve the first equation: $-y = e^{-yC_k}$, where $C_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi$.\nLet's analyze the possibility of solutions for $y$.\n*   If $y>0$, then $-y<0$. However, the right side $e^{-yC_k}$ can only be negative if the exponent is complex, which is not the case here. So we must have $e^{-yC_k} > 0$. Thus, no solutions exist for $y>0$.\n*   If $y<0$, let $y = -b$ where $b>0$. The equation becomes $b = e^{bC_k}$.\n    *   If $k \\ge 0$, then $C_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi \\ge \\frac{\\pi}{2} > 1$. For $b>0$, the exponential function $f(b) = e^{bC_k}$ starts at $f(0)=1$ and its slope $f'(b)=C_ke^{bC_k}$ is always greater than 1 (the slope of the line $g(b)=b$). Therefore, $e^{bC_k} > b$ for all $b>0$, and there are no solutions.\n    *   If $k \\le -1$, then $C_k < 0$. Let $C_k = -D_k$ where $D_k = -(\\frac{\\pi}{2}+2k\\pi) > 0$. The equation becomes $b = e^{-bD_k}$. The function $f(b)=e^{-bD_k}$ starts at $f(0)=1$ and decreases towards 0. The function $g(b)=b$ starts at $g(0)=0$ and increases. A graphical analysis shows that they must intersect for exactly one value $b_k > 0$. Thus, for each integer $k \\le -1$, there is a unique solution $z_k = iy_k = -ib_k$.\n\nThese solutions can be expressed using the Lambert W function. The equation $b=e^{-bD_k}$ can be rewritten as $bD_k e^{bD_k} = D_k$. Let $v=bD_k$, then $ve^v=D_k$. The solution is $v = W(D_k)$, where $W$ is the Lambert W function. Since $D_k > 0$, the principal branch $W_0$ gives a unique real solution. So, $b_k D_k = W_0(D_k)$, which gives $b_k = \\frac{W_0(D_k)}{D_k}$.\nThe solutions are $z_k = -i \\frac{W_0(-(\\frac{\\pi}{2}+2k\\pi))}{-(\\frac{\\pi}{2}+2k\\pi)} = i \\frac{W_0(-C_k)}{C_k}$ for $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}, k \\le -1$.\n\n**Case 3: $z$ is a complex number with $x \\ne 0$ and $y \\ne 0$**\nA more detailed analysis of the system of equations for the real and imaginary parts shows that no other solutions exist. The argument of both sides of the equation must match, which imposes strong constraints on the possible values of $z$, leading back to the cases already identified.\n\nThe solutions to the equation $z\\cdot i=i^z$ are:\n1.  $z=1$\n2.  $z=-1$\n3.  An infinite set of purely imaginary numbers $z_k = iy_k$ for each integer $k \\le -1$, where $y_k$ is the unique negative solution to the transcendental equation $-y = e^{-y(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)}$.\n\n<<<\nThe solutions for $z\\in\\mathbb{C}$ are:\n1.  $z = 1$\n2.  $z = -1$\n3.  For each integer $k \\le -1$, there is a unique purely imaginary solution $z_k = iy_k$, where $y_k$ is the negative real number that satisfies the equation $-y = e^{-y(\\frac{\\pi}{2}+2k\\pi)}$. These solutions can be expressed using the principal branch of the Lambert W function as $y_k = \\frac{W_0(-(\\frac{\\pi}{2}+2k\\pi))}{\\frac{\\pi}{2}+2k\\pi}$.\n>>>"
