The solutions for $z\in\mathbb{C}$ are:
1.  $z = 1$
2.  $z = -1$
3.  For each integer $k \le -1$, there is a unique purely imaginary solution $z_k = iy_k$, where $y_k$ is the negative real number that satisfies the equation $-y = e^{-y(\frac{\pi}{2}+2k\pi)}$. These solutions can be expressed using the principal branch of the Lambert W function as $y_k = \frac{W_0(-(\frac{\pi}{2}+2k\pi))}{\frac{\pi}{2}+2k\pi}$.
