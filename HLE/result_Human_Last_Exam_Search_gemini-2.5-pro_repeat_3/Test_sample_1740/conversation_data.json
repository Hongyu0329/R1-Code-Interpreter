    "To date, the let-7 family in humans is understood to consist of a set of unique mature microRNA (miRNA) sequences that are encoded by a larger number of precursor genes.\n\nIn humans, between nine and ten mature let-7 family members have been identified. These include let-7a, let-7b, let-7c, let-7d, let-7e, let-7f, let-7g, let-7i, and miR-98. Some sources also include miR-202 in this group, bringing the total to ten unique sequences.\n\nThese mature miRNAs are produced from 12 to 13 precursor genes, which are located at various sites across the human genome. For instance, the mature let-7a sequence is encoded by three separate genes (let-7a-1, let-7a-2, and let-7a-3). The let-7 family is highly conserved across many species and plays a crucial role in regulating cell differentiation and development. Misregulation of the let-7 family has been linked to the development of cancers.\n\n<<<10 mature members derived from 13 precursor genes>>>"
