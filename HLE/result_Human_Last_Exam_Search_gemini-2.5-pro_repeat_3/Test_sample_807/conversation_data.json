    "The Crayola crayon color that contains 9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride is **Shocking Pink**.\n\nThe chemical name 9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride is more commonly known as Rhodamine B. Rhodamine B is a synthetic dye recognized for its vibrant and fluorescent pink color. When in powder form, it appears green, but it transforms into a bright fluorescent pink when it comes into contact with water.\n\nCrayola has a history of producing fluorescent crayons, with \"Shocking Pink\" being a prominent example. This color was first introduced in 1972 under the name \"Ultra Pink\" and was officially renamed \"Shocking Pink\" in 1990. While Crayola does not typically disclose the specific pigments used for each crayon color, the properties of Rhodamine B align with the fluorescent nature of Shocking Pink. A patent filed by Crayola for colored bubbles also lists Rhodamine B as a suitable fluorescent dye. Additionally, a safety data sheet for another crayon brand lists Rhodamine B as a colorant, demonstrating its use in crayon manufacturing.\n\n<<<Shocking Pink>>>"
