    "To determine the number of submatrices accessed during the multiplication of two Hierarchical Semi-separable (HSS) matrices, we first need to understand the structure of an HSS matrix and the algorithm for its multiplication. An HSS matrix is defined by a hierarchical partitioning of the matrix, which can be represented by a tree. The matrix is not stored explicitly; instead, a set of smaller submatrices, called generators, is stored. These generators can be used to reconstruct any element of the full matrix.\n\n### HSS Matrix Structure\n\nFor a given matrix, an HSS representation is associated with a hierarchical tree. In this case, we consider a full binary tree of depth 4. Such a tree has 5 levels (from level 0, the root, to level 4, the leaves).\n\nThe generators of an HSS matrix are:\n*   **D matrices:** These are dense diagonal blocks stored at each leaf node of the tree.\n*   **U and V matrices:** These are basis matrices that are used to compress the off-diagonal blocks. They are stored for every node that is a child of another node (i.e., all nodes except the root).\n*   **B matrices:** These are small coupling matrices that represent the interaction between sibling blocks. They are stored for each pair of sibling nodes.\n\n### Counting the Submatrices for a Depth-4 Tree\n\nLet's calculate the number of these generator submatrices for a single HSS matrix with a depth-4 tree:\n\n1.  **Leaf Nodes (Level 4):** A full binary tree of depth 4 has `2^4 = 16` leaf nodes. Each leaf node stores one **D** matrix.\n    *   Number of D matrices = 16.\n\n2.  **Child Nodes (Levels 1, 2, 3, 4):** All nodes from level 1 to level 4 are children of a parent node. The number of nodes at these levels is `2^1 + 2^2 + 2^3 + 2^4 = 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 = 30`. Each of these 30 nodes has a **U** matrix and a **V** matrix.\n    *   Number of U matrices = 30.\n    *   Number of V matrices = 30.\n\n3.  **Sibling Pairs (Levels 1, 2, 3, 4):** The B matrices are associated with pairs of siblings.\n    *   At level 1, there is 1 pair of siblings, requiring 2 **B** matrices (`B_12`, `B_21`).\n    *   At level 2, there are 2 pairs of siblings, requiring 4 **B** matrices.\n    *   At level 3, there are 4 pairs of siblings, requiring 8 **B** matrices.\n    *   At level 4, there are 8 pairs of siblings, requiring 16 **B** matrices.\n    *   Total number of B matrices = `2 + 4 + 8 + 16 = 30`.\n\nSo, for a single HSS matrix, the total number of submatrices (generators) is `16 (D) + 30 (U) + 30 (V) + 30 (B) = 106`.\n\n### HSS Matrix Multiplication\n\nThe multiplication of two HSS matrices, say `A` and `B`, to produce `C = A * B`, is performed using a recursive algorithm. This algorithm computes the generators of the resulting HSS matrix `C` by using the generators of `A` and `B`. The computation typically involves an upward pass through the tree, from the leaves to the root. At each node, the calculation of the generators for `C` requires the generators from the corresponding nodes and their children in both `A` and `B`.\n\nBecause the algorithm relies on the generator representations of the input matrices to construct the generator representation of the output, all generator submatrices of both `A` and `B` must be accessed during the computation.\n\n### Total Number of Accessed Submatrices\n\nSince the multiplication algorithm accesses all the generators of both input matrices, the total number of submatrices accessed is the sum of the submatrices in `A` and the submatrices in `B`.\n\n*   Number of submatrices in matrix A = 106\n*   Number of submatrices in matrix B = 106\n*   Total accessed submatrices = 106 + 106 = 212\n\n<<<212>>>"
