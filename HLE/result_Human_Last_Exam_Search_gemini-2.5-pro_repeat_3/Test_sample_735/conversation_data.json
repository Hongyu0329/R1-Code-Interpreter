    "There are **26** finite groups that contain maximal by inclusion product-free sets of size 3.\n\nA subset *S* of a group *G* is called \"product-free\" if for all elements *a* and *b* in *S*, their product *ab* is not in *S*. A product-free set is \"maximal by inclusion\" (or \"locally maximal\") if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set in the same group.\n\nThe classification of finite groups containing such sets of size 3 was completed by Chimere Anabanti and Sarah Hart. They proved that any finite group containing a maximal by inclusion product-free set of size 3 must have an order of 24 or less. Their work confirmed the completeness of a list of all such groups.\n\nThe 26 finite groups are:\n*   **Cyclic Groups (13 groups):** C₅, C₆, C₇, C₈, C₉, C₁₀, C₁₁, C₁₂, C₁₄, C₁₅, C₁₈, C₂₀, C₂₄\n*   **Dihedral Groups (5 groups):** D₈, D₁₀, D₁₂, D₁₄, D₁₈\n*   **Other Abelian Groups (4 groups):** C₂ × C₂ × C₂, C₃ × C₃, C₂ × C₄, C₂ × C₆\n*   **Other Non-Abelian Groups (4 groups):** The Alternating group A₄, the Special Linear group SL(2,3), the Quaternion group Q₈, and the direct product C₃ × S₃.\n\n<<<26>>>"
