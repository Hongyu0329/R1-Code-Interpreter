    "## A Crowning Achievement: Unpacking the Numbers of MLB's Triple Crown Winners\n\nIn the long and storied history of Major League Baseball, a total of **17** players have achieved the prestigious batting Triple Crown. This coveted honor is awarded to a player who leads their league in three key offensive categories in a single season: batting average, home runs, and runs batted in (RBI). However, the total number of Triple Crown-winning seasons is **22**, as four players have accomplished this remarkable feat on multiple occasions.\n\nThe landscape of baseball's historical records underwent a significant change in 2020 when MLB officially incorporated statistics from the Negro Leagues (1920-1948). This decision rightfully added several incredible players to the list of Triple Crown winners, expanding the honor roll and offering a more complete picture of baseball's greatest single-season performances.\n\n### The Elite Club of Triple Crown Winners\n\nHere is the complete list of the 17 players who have won the batting Triple Crown, recognized by Major League Baseball:\n\n| Year | Player | Team | League |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| 1878 | Paul Hines | Providence Grays | National League |\n| 1887 | Tip O'Neill | St. Louis Browns | American Association |\n| 1901 | Nap Lajoie | Philadelphia Athletics | American League |\n| 1909 | Ty Cobb | Detroit Tigers | American League |\n| 1921 | Oscar Charleston | Homestead Grays | Negro National League |\n| 1922 | Rogers Hornsby | St. Louis Cardinals | National League |\n| 1923 | Heavy Johnson | Kansas City Monarchs | Negro National League |\n| 1924 | Oscar Charleston | Harrisburg Giants | Eastern Colored League |\n| 1925 | Rogers Hornsby | St. Louis Cardinals | National League |\n| 1925 | Oscar Charleston | Harrisburg Giants | Eastern Colored League |\n| 1926 | Mule Suttles | St. Louis Stars | Negro National League |\n| 1930 | Willie Wells | St. Louis Stars | Negro National League |\n| 1933 | Jimmie Foxx | Philadelphia Athletics | American League |\n| 1933 | Chuck Klein | Philadelphia Phillies | National League |\n| 1934 | Lou Gehrig | New York Yankees | American League |\n| 1936 | Josh Gibson | Pittsburgh Crawfords | Negro National League |\n| 1937 | Joe Medwick | St. Louis Cardinals | National League |\n| 1937 | Josh Gibson | Homestead Grays | Negro National League |\n| 1942 | Ted Williams | Boston Red Sox | American League |\n| 1947 | Ted Williams | Boston Red Sox | American League |\n| 1956 | Mickey Mantle | New York Yankees | American League |\n| 1966 | Frank Robinson | Baltimore Orioles | American League |\n| 1967 | Carl Yastrzemski | Boston Red Sox | American League |\n| 2012 | Miguel Cabrera | Detroit Tigers | American League |\n\n*Note: The American Association is considered a historical major league.*\n\n### Multiple-Time Winners\n\nFour players have the distinguished honor of winning the Triple Crown more than once:\n\n*   **Oscar Charleston:** 3 times (1921, 1924, 1925)\n*   **Rogers Hornsby:** 2 times (1922, 1925)\n*   **Ted Williams:** 2 times (1942, 1947)\n*   **Josh Gibson:** 2 times (1936, 1937)\n\n### Clarifying the Numbers: The Case of Hugh Duffy\n\nSome historical records may include outfielder Hugh Duffy as a Triple Crown winner for his phenomenal 1894 season with the Boston Beaneaters. While he definitively led the National League with a still-record .440 batting average and 18 home runs, modern research has revised his RBI total for that season, placing him second in that category. Consequently, official MLB records do not recognize Duffy as a Triple Crown winner.\n\nThe inclusion of Negro League statistics has led to some discrepancies in reported totals, with some sources still catching up to the official changes. The definitive list provided here reflects the current, officially recognized winners across all of what MLB now considers its Major Leagues.\n\n<<<17>>>"
