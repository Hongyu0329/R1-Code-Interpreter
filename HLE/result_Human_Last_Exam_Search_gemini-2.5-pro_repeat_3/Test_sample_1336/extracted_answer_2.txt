The total number of such smooth coverings for a given prime `p > 5` is given by the formula `(p - (5/p))/2`, where `(5/p)` denotes the Legendre symbol.

This result is derived from the study of regular dessins d'enfants, which are graph embeddings on surfaces. A dessin `D(G, b, w)` is constructed from a group `G` and two generators `b` and `w`. In this context, `G` is the special linear group `SL(2, p)`.

A "smooth covering" in this context refers to a covering map from the dessin `D(SL(2, p), b, w)` to the dessin `D(PSL(2, p), b, w)` that preserves the valencies of the vertices and faces. This condition is met if and only if the order of the element `bw` in `SL(2, p)` is the same as the order of its image in `PSL(2, p)`. For `SL(2, p)`, this is equivalent to the condition that the order of the element `bw` must be odd.

The problem then reduces to counting how many choices of `w` (from a specific set of generators) result in `bw` having an odd order. By analyzing the trace of the resulting matrices, which involves Lucas numbers, the number of such instances can be calculated. The final count depends on whether the prime `p` is a quadratic residue modulo 5.

The formula can be broken down as follows:
*   The number of smooth coverings is `(p - 1)/2` if `p \equiv \pm 1 \pmod{5}`.
*   The number of smooth coverings is `(p + 1)/2` if `p \equiv \pm 2 \pmod{5}`.

These two cases are concisely expressed using the Legendre symbol `(5/p)`.
