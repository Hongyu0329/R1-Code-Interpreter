    "The category of finite-dimensional representations of the quantum group $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$ for $q$ a primitive third root of unity has a rich and complex structure. To determine the percentage of its indecomposable objects that are irreducible, we must first clarify the precise set of representations under consideration.\n\nThe full category of finite-dimensional representations of $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$ contains infinitely many isomorphism classes of objects. The majority of these are \"generic\" representations which form semisimple blocks, meaning each block contains a single simple (irreducible) object which is, by definition, also indecomposable. If these generic representations are included, the total number of both irreducible and indecomposable objects is infinite, and their ratio is 100%.\n\nHowever, the representation theory at a root of unity is primarily concerned with the non-semisimple aspects, which are captured in a finite number of \"singular\" blocks. It is a common convention in this area to analyze the structure of these non-semisimple blocks. When $q$ is a primitive third root of unity (so the order is $\\ell=3$), there are three such non-semisimple blocks.\n\nThe objects of the category $C$ are therefore interpreted as the indecomposable representations within these non-semisimple blocks.\n\nThe three non-semisimple blocks are:\n1.  **The Principal Block ($\\mathcal{C}_0$)**: This block is equivalent to the category of representations for the *small quantum group* $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$. It contains two simple (irreducible) objects. The total number of indecomposable objects in this block has been determined to be nine.\n2.  **Two Other Non-semisimple Blocks ($\\mathcal{C}_1, \\mathcal{C}_{-1}$)**: These two blocks are equivalent to each other. Their structure is described by the representation theory of the Taft algebra $T_2$. The category of representations of the Taft algebra $T_n$ is known to have $n$ simple objects and $n^2$ indecomposable objects. For $n=2$, each of these blocks therefore contains two simple objects and four indecomposable objects.\n\nBy combining the objects from all non-semisimple blocks, we can calculate the overall percentage:\n\n*   **Total Number of Irreducible Objects**:\n    *   From the principal block: 2\n    *   From the other two blocks: 2 + 2 = 4\n    *   Total: 2 + 4 = 6\n\n*   **Total Number of Indecomposable Objects**:\n    *   From the principal block: 9\n    *   From the other two blocks: 4 + 4 = 8\n    *   Total: 9 + 8 = 17\n\nThe percentage of indecomposable objects that are irreducible is the ratio of these two totals:\n\nPercentage = (Total Irreducible / Total Indecomposable) × 100 = (6 / 17) × 100\n\nCalculating this value gives approximately 35.29%.\n\n<<<35.29>>>"
