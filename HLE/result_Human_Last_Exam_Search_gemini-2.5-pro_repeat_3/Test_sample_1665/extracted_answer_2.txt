The magnetic field will be more strong in the situations where the cylinder is made of a ferromagnetic material (scenario 1), consists of a ferromagnetic core surrounded by a superconducting shell (scenario 3), and consists of a superconducting core surrounded by a ferromagnetic shell (scenario 4). The strongest enhancement is expected in scenario 3.
