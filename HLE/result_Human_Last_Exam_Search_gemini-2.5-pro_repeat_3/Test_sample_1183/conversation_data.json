    "The symmetry group of the molecule with the SMILES string `C#Cc1cc2ccc3c(C#C)cc4ccc5c(C#C)cc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67` is D3h.\n\nThe molecule in question is a derivative of triangulene, a class of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons known for their triangular shape and high symmetry. The core of the molecule, triangulene, is a planar structure with a threefold axis of rotation (C3). Scientific studies have confirmed the threefold symmetric molecular structure of triangulenes.\n\nThe SMILES string indicates that three linear ethynyl (`-C≡C-H`) groups are attached to the corners of this triangular core. The placement of these substituents maintains the overall symmetry of the molecule. Key symmetry elements of the D3h point group present in this molecule are:\n*   A principal C3 axis of rotation.\n*   Three C2 axes of rotation perpendicular to the C3 axis.\n*   A horizontal mirror plane (σh) that contains the entire molecule, as it is planar.\n*   Three vertical mirror planes (σv).\n*   An S3 improper rotation axis.\n\nGiven that the triangulene core is planar and has D3h symmetry, and the symmetric substitution with linear ethynyl groups does not reduce this symmetry, the entire molecule belongs to the D3h point group.\n\n<<<D3h>>>"
