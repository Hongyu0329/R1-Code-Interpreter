    "A power subgroup is a subgroup that is generated by a single element, which is the definition of a cyclic subgroup. The question asks for the number of cyclic subgroups in the semidihedral group of order 512.\n\nThe semidihedral group of order 512, denoted as SD₂₅₆, has the presentation:\nSD₂₅₆ = <a, b | a²⁵⁶ = 1, b² = 1, bab = a¹²⁷>\n\nThe cyclic subgroups can be categorized into those entirely contained within the cyclic subgroup `<a>` and those that are not.\n\n1.  **Cyclic subgroups within `<a>`**: The subgroup `<a>` is a cyclic group of order 256. A cyclic group of order *n* has exactly one cyclic subgroup for each divisor of *n*. The number of divisors of 256 (which is 2⁸) is 8 + 1 = 9. These subgroups correspond to the orders 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, and 256.\n\n2.  **Cyclic subgroups involving the element `b`**: These subgroups are generated by elements of the form `aⁱb`. We analyze the order of these elements:\n    *   **(aⁱb)² = aⁱ(baⁱb) = aⁱ(a⁻¹²⁷b)ⁱb = aⁱ(a⁻¹²⁷)ⁱb² = aⁱa⁻¹²⁷ⁱ = aⁱ(¹⁻¹²⁷) = a⁻¹²⁶ⁱ**.\n        *   Correction on relation: `bab = a¹²⁷` implies `ba = a¹²⁷b`. So, `baⁱb = (ba)ⁱb = (a¹²⁷b)ⁱb`. This is not straightforward.\n        *   Let's use conjugation: `bab⁻¹ = a¹²⁷`. Then `baⁱb⁻¹ = (bab⁻¹)ⁱ = (a¹²⁷)ⁱ = a¹²⁷ⁱ`.\n        *   (aⁱb)² = aⁱ(baⁱb) = aⁱ(a¹²⁷ⁱb)b = aⁱa¹²⁷ⁱb² = aⁱ⁽¹⁺¹²⁷⁾ = a¹²⁸ⁱ.\n    *   **Case 1: `i` is even**. Let `i = 2j`. Then `(a²ʲb)² = a¹²⁸⁽²ʲ⁾ = a²⁵⁶ʲ = e`. The elements `a²ʲb` have an order of 2. There are 128 such elements (for j = 0 to 127). Each of these generates a distinct cyclic subgroup of order 2. These are distinct from the order-2 subgroup `<a¹²⁸>` found in `<a>`. This gives 128 new cyclic subgroups.\n    *   **Case 2: `i` is odd**. Let `i = 2j+1`. Then `(aⁱb)² = a¹²⁸ⁱ = a¹²⁸` (since i is odd). This element has order 2. Therefore, `(aⁱb)⁴ = (a¹²⁸)² = e`. The elements `aⁱb` with odd `i` have an order of 4. There are 128 such elements. A cyclic group of order 4 has φ(4) = 2 generators. Thus, these 128 elements form 128 / 2 = 64 distinct cyclic subgroups of order 4. These subgroups are different from the order-4 subgroup `<a⁶⁴>` from `<a>` because they contain elements outside of `<a>`. This adds another 64 cyclic subgroups.\n\nIn total, the number of power subgroups is the sum of these counts:\nTotal = (subgroups from `<a>`) + (subgroups from `aⁱb` with `i` even) + (subgroups from `aⁱb` with `i` odd)\nTotal = 9 + 128 + 64 = 201.\n\n<<<201>>>"
