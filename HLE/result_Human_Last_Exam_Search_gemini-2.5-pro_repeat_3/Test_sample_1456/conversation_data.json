    "The largest possible number of composants of the product of two nondegenerate continua is **c**, the cardinality of the continuum (which is the cardinality of the set of real numbers, $2^{\\aleph_0}$).\n\nHere is a justification for this answer:\n\n### Key Definitions\n\n*   **Continuum**: A compact, connected metric space. A continuum is called nondegenerate if it contains more than one point.\n*   **Composant**: The composant of a point *p* in a continuum *X* is the set of all points *x* in *X* such that there is a proper subcontinuum of *X* that contains both *p* and *x*. The number of composants of a continuum is the number of distinct sets that can be formed in this way.\n*   **Decomposable vs. Indecomposable Continua**: A continuum is decomposable if it can be written as the union of two of its proper subcontinua. Otherwise, it is called indecomposable.\n\n### Number of Composants in an Indecomposable Continuum\n\nA fundamental result in continuum theory states that any nondegenerate indecomposable continuum has exactly **c** (the cardinality of the continuum) distinct composants. These composants form a partition of the space, and each one is a dense subset of the continuum. Examples of such continua include the pseudo-arc and various types of Knaster continua.\n\n### Composants of a Product of Continua\n\nThe question asks for the maximum number of composants for a product space *X* Ã— *Y*, where *X* and *Y* are nondegenerate continua. The product of two continua is itself a continuum. To find the maximum possible number of composants, we need to find an example of *X* and *Y* such that their product has the highest number of composants.\n\n1.  **The product of two continua can be indecomposable.** A key example is the **pseudo-arc**. The pseudo-arc is a hereditarily indecomposable continuum (meaning all of its nondegenerate subcontinua are indecomposable). A significant result by R.H. Bing shows that the product of two pseudo-arcs is itself a pseudo-arc.\n2.  Since the product of two pseudo-arcs is a pseudo-arc, it is an indecomposable continuum.\n3.  As established, any indecomposable continuum has **c** composants.\n\nTherefore, there exists a product of two nondegenerate continua that has **c** composants.\n\n### The Maximum Number\n\nThe number of composants of a continuum cannot exceed the number of points in the continuum. Since any nondegenerate metric continuum has cardinality **c**, the number of composants cannot be greater than **c**.\n\nBecause we have found an example where the number of composants is **c**, and we know this is the maximum possible number, we can conclude that the largest possible number of composants is **c**.\n\nIt is worth noting that this result is not limited to indecomposable products. It has been proven that the product of *any* two indecomposable continua has **c** composants, even if the product itself is decomposable. Furthermore, one can also construct a decomposable product with **c** composants, for instance by taking the product of an arc (a decomposable continuum) and a pseudo-arc (an indecomposable continuum).\n\n<<<c>>>"
