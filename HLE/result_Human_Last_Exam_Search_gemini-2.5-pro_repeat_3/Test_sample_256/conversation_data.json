    "The symmetry group of the best-known packing of 1135 congruent circles in a circle is C₁ in Schoenflies notation.\n\nThis determination is based on the comprehensive database of \"The best known packings of equal circles in a circle\" maintained by Eckard Specht. This database provides information on optimal and best-known packings for a large number of circles, including their symmetry groups. For many packings, especially for larger numbers of circles that do not form a clear, regular pattern, the resulting arrangement lacks any non-trivial rotational or reflectional symmetry. In the referenced database, when the symmetry group field is empty, it indicates a C₁ symmetry group, which represents the absence of any symmetry elements apart from the identity. The packing for N=1135 falls into this category.\n\n<<<C₁>>>"
