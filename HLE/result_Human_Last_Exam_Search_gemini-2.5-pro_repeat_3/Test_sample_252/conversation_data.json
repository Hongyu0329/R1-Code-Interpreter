    "A Computed Tomography Imaging Spectrometer (CTIS) constructs a three-dimensional dataset, known as a spectral volume or data cube (two spatial dimensions and one spectral dimension), from a single two-dimensional image. This is achieved by using a diffractive optical element to project multiple, spectrally dispersed images onto a single detector array. These projections are then used in a tomographic reconstruction algorithm to compute the full data cube.\n\nThe core principle of computed tomography requires multiple \"projections\" or \"views\" through the object to reconstruct it in a higher dimension. In the case of a CTIS, the object is the 3D data cube, and the projections are the dispersed images.\n\n*   **Single 1D Grating:** A single one-dimensional diffraction grating would only disperse light along one axis. This provides only one set of projections, which is insufficient for a full tomographic reconstruction. This situation leads to a \"missing cone\" problem in the data, where a significant portion of the object's information is not captured, making a full reconstruction impossible.\n*   **Two or more Gratings:** To obtain the necessary views for reconstruction, the light must be dispersed in at least two different directions. This can be accomplished by using a pair of crossed one-dimensional gratings. Often, a single optical component known as a 2D computer-generated hologram (CGH) is used, which functions as two crossed gratings. This 2D dispersion creates a pattern of diffraction orders (e.g., a 3x3 or 5x5 array) on the detector, providing the multiple, angularly distinct projections necessary for the algorithm to reconstruct the spectral volume.\n\nTherefore, to create the 2D dispersion pattern required for single-shot tomographic reconstruction, a minimum of two diffraction gratings (or a single 2D grating that performs the function of two) is necessary.\n\n<<<B>>>"
