    "The user is asking for the coldest temperature at which Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF4) can be still produced efficiently.\n\nBased on the search results, here's a summary of the synthesis methods and temperatures:\n\n*   **Standard Method:** Heating a mixture of xenon and fluorine (typically in a 1:5 molar ratio) in a nickel container at **400 °C**. This appears to be the most common and repeatedly cited method for producing good yields of XeF4.\n*   **Flow Methods:** Passing a mixture of xenon and fluorine through a nickel tube at **300-500°C**. However, this method can result in contamination with XeF2.\n*   **Electric Discharge:** Using an electric discharge at low temperatures. This method is also noted to result in contamination with XeF2.\n*   **Catalyzed Reaction:** In the presence of a nickel difluoride catalyst, it's possible to synthesize XeF6 at **120 °C**. The text mentions that with this catalyst, the reaction between xenon and fluorine can occur at lower temperatures, implying it could also be applicable for XeF4, though it explicitly states XeF6 synthesis at 120°C.\n*   **Combustion Method:** A Russian patent describes a method where a combustion initiator is heated to **650-700 °C** to start the reaction. This is a higher temperature.\n*   **Low Temperature Reaction with O2F2:** XeF4 can react with O2F2 between 140 and 195 K (which is -133.15 °C to -78.15 °C) to form XeF6. This is a reaction *of* XeF4, not a synthesis *of* it from xenon and fluorine.\n\nThe most frequently cited efficient synthesis method is heating xenon and fluorine at 400 °C. While other methods exist, they either result in significant impurities or are for different xenon fluorides. One source mentions the possibility of a catalyzed reaction at 120 °C, but this was for XeF6. Another mentions reaction products are observed at temperatures as low as 270°C. A patent for a combustion method uses a much higher initiation temperature.\n\nConsidering the provided options:\nA. 600 C\nB. 400 C\nC. 200 C\nD. 78 C\nE. 0 C\nF. -78 C\n\nThe most common and efficient temperature mentioned is 400°C. While lower temperatures are mentioned in some contexts, they are either for different products or lead to significant impurities, which goes against the \"produced efficiently\" part of the question. Therefore, 400°C is the most reliable answer based on the provided search results.\n\nI have sufficient information to answer the question.The most common and efficient method for the synthesis of Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF₄) involves the direct reaction of xenon (Xe) and fluorine (F₂) gas. This process is typically carried out by heating a mixture of xenon and fluorine, in a 1:5 molar ratio, within a sealed nickel vessel at a temperature of approximately 400 °C and a pressure of 6 atmospheres. The nickel container is used because it forms a protective layer of nickel(II) fluoride on its surface, which prevents corrosion from the highly reactive fluorine gas.\n\nWhile the reaction between xenon and fluorine can occur over a range of temperatures, 400 °C is widely cited as the optimal temperature to produce XeF₄ efficiently, minimizing the formation of other xenon fluorides like xenon difluoride (XeF₂) and xenon hexafluoride (XeF₆). Lower temperatures tend to favor the formation of XeF₂, while higher temperatures and an excess of fluorine favor XeF₆.\n\nOther synthesis methods have been explored:\n*   Flow methods, where xenon and fluorine are passed through a heated nickel tube at 300-500°C, have been used but can lead to contamination with XeF₂.\n*   Synthesis using electric discharge at low temperatures also tends to produce impurities.\n*   A Russian patent describes a combustion method initiated by heating a component to 650-700 °C.\n\nConsidering the efficiency and purity of the final product, the thermal method at 400 °C remains the standard.\n\n<<<B>>>"
