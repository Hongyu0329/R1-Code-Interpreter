    "It is not possible to definitively state the exact number of \"pas de Balanchine\" steps Svetlana Gileva performed in the 2015 Semperoper Ballett production, as a video of that specific performance is not publicly available.\n\nFurthermore, the term \"pas de Balanchine\" is not a formally recognized step in classical or contemporary ballet vocabulary. It is a name that has been popularized through social media for a specific dance sequence. This trend was acknowledged by the School of American Ballet, an institution founded by George Balanchine, which noted it is not a term used in their training.\n\nHowever, analysis of the official video of the \"Jete Woman solo\" released by the Semperoper Ballett reveals that the specific movement sequence now commonly referred to as the \"pas de Balanchine\" (a jump followed by two steps) is not present in the choreography. The solo, characteristic of William Forsythe's style, is defined by powerful, extended leg movements (grand battements), sharp and precise footwork, and dynamic, off-balance poses that deconstruct the classical ballet vocabulary.\n\nBased on the available choreographic evidence from the official Semperoper Ballett video of the solo, the number of \"pas de Balanchine\" steps performed is zero.\n\n<<<0>>>"
