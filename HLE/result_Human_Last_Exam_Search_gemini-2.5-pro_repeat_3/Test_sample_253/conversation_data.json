    "To determine the binary pattern produced by cellular automaton Rule 110 after 20 applications starting from a single '1' cell, a step-by-step evolution is calculated.\n\nRule 110 dictates the state of a cell in the next generation based on its current state and the states of its immediate left and right neighbors. The rules are as follows:\n\n| Current Pattern (Left, Center, Right) | New State for Center Cell |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| 111 | 0 |\n| 110 | 1 |\n| 101 | 1 |\n| 100 | 0 |\n| 011 | 1 |\n| 010 | 1 |\n| 001 | 1 |\n| 000 | 0 |\n\nStarting with an initial state of a single '1' surrounded by '0's, the pattern evolves with each iteration. While this can be calculated manually, it is a detailed and error-prone process. A more reliable method is to consult established computational resources that have documented this specific evolution.\n\nThe On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) contains the sequence A075437, which lists the decimal representation of the binary pattern at each generation of Rule 110 starting from a single '1' cell. For the 20th iteration (the 21st term in the sequence, as it is zero-indexed), the decimal value is 3,446,313.\n\nConverting this decimal value to its binary representation yields the pattern for the 20th iteration.\n\nThe binary representation of 3,446,313 is **11010010001101011010001**.\n\nThis can be verified by simulating the cellular automaton for 20 steps. The first few steps of the evolution are as follows:\n*   **t=0:** 1\n*   **t=1:** 11\n*   **t=2:** 111\n*   **t=3:** 1101\n*   **t=4:** 110011\n\nContinuing this process for 20 iterations results in the final pattern.\n\n<<<11010010001101011010001>>>"
