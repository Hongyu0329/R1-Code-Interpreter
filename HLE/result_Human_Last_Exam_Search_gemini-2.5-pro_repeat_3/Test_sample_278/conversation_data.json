    "The parametric curve is defined in two parts.\n\n**Part 1: For the interval $t \\in [0, \\pi]$**\nThe equations are $x = \\cos t$ and $y = \\sin t$ (since $b=1$). These equations describe the upper half of a unit circle centered at the origin.\n*   The x-values range from $\\cos(\\pi) = -1$ to $\\cos(0) = 1$.\n*   The y-values range from $\\sin(\\pi/2) = 1$ (the maximum) down to $\\sin(0) = \\sin(\\pi) = 0$.\nSo, for this part, the range of coordinates is $x \\in [-1, 1]$ and $y \\in$.\n\n**Part 2: For the interval $t \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$**\nThe equations are $x = \\cos t$ and $y = 5\\sin t$ (since $b=5$). These equations describe the lower half of an ellipse centered at the origin, with a semi-horizontal axis of 1 and a semi-vertical axis of 5.\n*   The x-values range from $\\cos(t)$ which for this interval still covers $[-1, 1]$.\n*   The y-values are given by $5\\sin t$. Since $\\sin t$ is negative in this interval, the range for y goes from $5\\sin(3\\pi/2) = -5$ up to 0.\nSo, for this part, the range of coordinates is $x \\in [-1, 1]$ and $y \\in [-5, 0)$.\n\n**Overall Figure Dimensions**\nTo find the dimensions of the entire figure, we combine the ranges from both parts:\n*   **Total range for x:** The union of $[-1, 1]$ and $[-1, 1]$ is $[-1, 1]$. The width of the figure is $1 - (-1) = 2$.\n*   **Total range for y:** The union of $$ and $[-5, 0)$ is $[-5, 1]$. The height of the figure is $1 - (-5) = 6$.\n\n**Smallest Circumscribing Square**\nA square that \"outcircles\" or circumscribes this figure must have a side length large enough to contain both the width and the height of the figure. The smallest such square will have a side length equal to the larger of these two dimensions.\n*   Width = 2\n*   Height = 6\n*   Side length of the smallest square, $s = \\max(2, 6) = 6$.\n\n**Area of the Square**\nThe area of a square is the side length squared.\n*   Area = $s^2 = 6^2 = 36$.\n\n<<<36>>>The parametric curve is defined in two parts.\n\n**Part 1: For the interval $t \\in [0, \\pi]$**\nThe equations are $x = \\cos t$ and $y = \\sin t$ (since $b=1$).
