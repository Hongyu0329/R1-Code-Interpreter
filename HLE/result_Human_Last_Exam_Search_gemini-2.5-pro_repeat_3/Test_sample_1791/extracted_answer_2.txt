The effective electron-electron interaction, for a given momentum transfer **q**, mediated by phonons, is given by the potential:
$V_{eff}(\mathbf{q}, \omega_n) = - \frac{g^2 |\mathbf{q}|^2}{m (\omega_n^2+w_q^2)}$
This represents an attractive interaction between electron densities, where $\omega_n$ is the Matsubara frequency corresponding to the energy transferred in the interaction.
