    "A unique architectural feature of the \"Piazza della Rotonda\" that was removed, though not in 1950 but rather between 1881 and 1883, were the twin bell towers on the Pantheon.\n\nThese bell towers were added to the Pantheon in 1628 by order of Pope Urban VIII and their design is often attributed to the famous artist Gian Lorenzo Bernini. However, they were not well-received by the public and were given the derogatory nickname \"le orecchie d'asino\" (the ass's ears). The removal of these towers was part of a series of efforts to restore the Pantheon to what was believed to be its original appearance and to clear the area around it.\n\nOver the centuries, the Piazza della Rotonda has undergone numerous transformations. In the early 19th century, Pope Pius VII ordered the demolition of many of the market stalls and shops that had crowded the square for years. Before that, in the 17th century, three missing columns on the east side of the Pantheon's portico were replaced. The well-known fountain in the center of the piazza was built in 1575, with the Egyptian obelisk being added in 1711.\n\n<<<The twin bell towers on the Pantheon.>>>"
