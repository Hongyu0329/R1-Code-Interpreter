    "To find the value of $m - 2^{4048}$, we first need to determine $m$, which represents the number of stable equilibrium points of the given differential equation:\n$$\nx'(t) = -x^{3}(t) + 2x^{2}(t) - x(t)\n$$\nEquilibrium points are the constant solutions to the differential equation, which are the values of $x$ for which $x'(t) = 0$. Let $f(x) = -x^{3} + 2x^{2} - x$. We need to solve $f(x) = 0$:\n$$\n-x^{3} + 2x^{2} - x = 0\n$$\nFactoring out $-x$ from the expression gives:\n$$\n-x(x^{2} - 2x + 1) = 0\n$$\nThe quadratic term is a perfect square, $(x-1)^2$. Thus, the equation becomes:\n$$\n-x(x - 1)^{2} = 0\n$$\nThe equilibrium points are the roots of this equation, which are $x = 0$ and $x = 1$.\n\nNext, we need to determine the stability of each equilibrium point. The stability can be analyzed by examining the sign of the derivative of $f(x)$, denoted as $f'(x)$, at each equilibrium point. The derivative of $f(x)$ is:\n$$\nf'(x) = -3x^{2} + 4x - 1\n$$\n\nFor the equilibrium point $x = 0$:\nWe evaluate $f'(0)$:\n$$\nf'(0) = -3(0)^{2} + 4(0) - 1 = -1\n$$\nSince $f'(0) < 0$, the equilibrium point $x = 0$ is stable.\n\nFor the equilibrium point $x = 1$:\nWe evaluate $f'(1)$:\n$$\nf'(1) = -3(1)^{2} + 4(1) - 1 = -3 + 4 - 1 = 0\n$$\nSince $f'(1) = 0$, the first derivative test is inconclusive. We must analyze the sign of $f(x)$ in the neighborhood of $x = 1$ to determine its stability.\nThe function is $f(x) = -x(x-1)^2$.\n*   For a value of $x$ slightly less than 1 (e.g., $x = 1 - \\epsilon$ for a small $\\epsilon > 0$), $f(x) = -(1-\\epsilon)(1-\\epsilon-1)^2 = -(1-\\epsilon)(-\\epsilon)^2 = -(1-\\epsilon)\\epsilon^2 < 0$. Since $x'(t) < 0$, the solution moves away from $x=1$.\n*   For a value of $x$ slightly greater than 1 (e.g., $x = 1 + \\epsilon$ for a small $\\epsilon > 0$), $f(x) = -(1+\\epsilon)(1+\\epsilon-1)^2 = -(1+\\epsilon)\\epsilon^2 < 0$. Since $x'(t) < 0$, the solution moves toward $x=1$.\n\nSince solutions starting on one side of $x=1$ (the left side) move away from it, the equilibrium point is not stable. Such an equilibrium point is called semi-stable, which is considered a type of unstable equilibrium.\n\nTherefore, there is only one stable equilibrium point, which is $x=0$. This means the number of stable equilibrium points, $m$, is 1.\n\nFinally, we need to calculate $m - 2^{4048}$:\n$$\nm - 2^{4048} = 1 - 2^{4048}\n$$\n\n<<<1 - 2^4048>>>"
