    "The Wittig reaction is a chemical process that converts aldehydes and ketones into alkenes using a phosphonium ylide (also known as a Wittig reagent). The reaction involves the replacement of the carbonyl oxygen atom with the carbon group from the ylide.\n\nTo determine the product of the reaction between pivalaldehyde and (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ5-phosphane, we must first identify the structures of the reactants.\n\n*   **Pivalaldehyde:** Also known as trimethylacetaldehyde, its structure is (CH₃)₃C-CHO. It is an aldehyde with a bulky tert-butyl group.\n*   **Wittig Reagent:** (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ5-phosphane. The `triphenyl-l5-phosphane` portion refers to PPh₃, and the `ethylidene` group is a two-carbon chain. Based on IUPAC nomenclature, the structure of the ylide is Ph₃P=CH-CH₂-(2-ClC₆H₄).\n\nThe mechanism of the Wittig reaction involves the nucleophilic attack of the ylide's carbon on the aldehyde's carbonyl carbon. This leads to the formation of a four-membered ring intermediate called an oxaphosphetane, which then decomposes to yield the final alkene product and triphenylphosphine oxide (Ph₃P=O).\n\nThe carbonyl group (C=O) of pivalaldehyde is replaced by the carbon-carbon double bond from the ylide (=CH-CH₂-(2-ClC₆H₄)). The resulting product connects the pivalaldehyde carbon to the ylide carbon, forming a new alkene.\n\nThe structure of the product is: (CH₃)₃C-CH=CH-CH₂-(C₆H₄Cl)\n\nThe systematic IUPAC name for this structure is **1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene**.\n\nThe reaction will likely produce a mixture of (E) and (Z) stereoisomers, as is common for Wittig reactions.\n\n<<<1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene>>>"
