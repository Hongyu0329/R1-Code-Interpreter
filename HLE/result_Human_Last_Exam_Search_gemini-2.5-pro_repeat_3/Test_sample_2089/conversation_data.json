    "The Oscar-nominated film in which a character's fate is sealed in a harrowing bus scene is Denis Villeneuve's 2010 masterpiece, *Incendies*. The film was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film.\n\nThe pivotal and deeply disturbing scene in question does not involve a character sealing their fate by saying \"Thank you\" upon boarding. Instead, the protagonist, Nawal Marwan, is traveling on a bus filled with Muslim refugees when it is ambushed by Christian nationalists during a brutal civil war. The attackers mercilessly open fire on the passengers.\n\nNawal survives the massacre by revealing a crucifix, proving she is a Christian. She attempts to save a young Muslim girl by pretending the child is hers, but the girl runs back towards the burning bus calling for her mother and is shot. This traumatic event becomes a turning point for Nawal, setting her on a path of retaliation and ultimately sealing her tragic fate, which her children uncover years later. The horror of this scene is a catalyst for the devastating revelations that follow.\n\nWhile a review of the film notes that the movie's emotional impact will make viewers say \"thank you,\" there is no instance of a character speaking this line to seal their fate within the narrative of the bus scene itself.\n\n<<<*Incendies*>>>"
