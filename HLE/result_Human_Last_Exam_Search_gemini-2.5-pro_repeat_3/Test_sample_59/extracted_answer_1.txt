The probability to draw a link \(y_{ij}\) between nodes `i` and `j` in a jointly exchangeable random graph is given by **W(\(U_i\), \(U_j\))**, where \(U_i\) and \(U_j\) are independent random variables drawn from a uniform distribution on, and `W` is a symmetric measurable function (a graphon) determined by the random measure `F`.
