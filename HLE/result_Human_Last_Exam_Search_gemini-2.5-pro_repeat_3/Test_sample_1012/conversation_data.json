    "An arbitrarily powerful quantum computer could theoretically crack a symmetric key using Grover's algorithm, which provides a quadratic speedup compared to classical brute-force attacks. This means that a quantum computer effectively halves the security level, or the \"bit strength,\" of a symmetric key.\n\nTo counter this, the key length must be doubled to maintain the same level of security against a quantum attack. For instance, a 128-bit key, which is traditionally considered strong, would only offer 64 bits of security against a quantum computer, which is not sufficient for long-term protection.\n\nTo achieve a security level of 128 bits against a quantum attack—a level widely considered secure for the foreseeable future—a symmetric key length of 256 bits is required. An attack on a 256-bit key using Grover's algorithm would necessitate roughly 2^128 operations, a task that remains computationally infeasible.\n\nOrganizations like the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the National Security Agency (NSA) indicate that while current symmetric key algorithms like AES are still secure, the move towards 256-bit keys is the necessary step for quantum resistance. The NSA already mandates the use of 256-bit AES keys for data classified as Top Secret.\n\nTherefore, a symmetric key needs to be at least 256 bits long to be secure against an attack from an arbitrarily powerful quantum computer.\n\n<<<A>>>"
