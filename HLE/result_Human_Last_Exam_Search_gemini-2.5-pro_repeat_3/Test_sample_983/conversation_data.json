    "The sequence is:\n1014, 1020, 1032, 1050, 1104, 1224, 1230, 1290, 1410, 1440, 1452, 1482, 1500, 1512, 1560, 1584, 1602, 1734, 1812, 1890, 1902, 1932, 1974, 2004, 2040, 2064, 2070, 2130, 2142, 2274, 2340, 2352\n\nFirst, let's analyze the differences between consecutive terms:\n*   1020 - 1014 = 6\n*   1032 - 1020 = 12\n*   1050 - 1032 = 18\n*   1104 - 1050 = 54\n*   1224 - 1104 = 120\n*   1230 - 1224 = 6\n*   1290 - 1230 = 60\n*   1410 - 1290 = 120\n*   1440 - 1410 = 30\n*   1452 - 1440 = 12\n*   1482 - 1452 = 30\n*   1500 - 1482 = 18\n*   1512 - 1500 = 12\n*   1560 - 1512 = 48\n*   1584 - 1560 = 24\n*   1602 - 1584 = 18\n*   1734 - 1602 = 132\n*   1812 - 1734 = 78\n*   1890 - 1812 = 78\n*   1902 - 1890 = 12\n*   1932 - 1902 = 30\n*   1974 - 1932 = 42\n*   2004 - 1974 = 30\n*   2040 - 2004 = 36\n*   2064 - 2040 = 24\n*   2070 - 2064 = 6\n*   2130 - 2070 = 60\n*   2142 - 2130 = 12\n*   2274 - 2142 = 132\n*   2340 - 2274 = 66\n*   2352 - 2340 = 12\n\nThe sequence of differences does not follow a simple arithmetic or geometric progression. However, a pattern emerges from the last three differences: 132, 66, 12. The second to last difference (66) is half of the third to last difference (132). This suggests a relationship where a difference is followed by its half.\n\nIf we apply this observation, we might speculate on the next difference. However, the last difference is 12, which is not half of 66. Let's look at the relationship between 66 and 12.\n66 / 5.5 = 12. This is not a simple relationship.\n\nLet's consider another possibility. The last difference is 12. A simple continuation would be for the difference to repeat.\n\nLet's assume the next difference is also 12.\n2352 + 12 = 2364.\n\nLet's explore another possibility. A key characteristic of the sequence is that all numbers are multiples of 6. Let's divide the sequence by 6:\n169, 170, 172, 175, 184, 204, 205, 215, 235, 240, 242, 247, 250, 252, 260, 264, 267, 289, 302, 315, 317, 322, 329, 334, 340, 344, 345, 355, 357, 379, 390, 392\n\nThe differences of this new sequence are:\n1, 2, 3, 9, 20, 1, 10, 20, 5, 2, 5, 3, 2, 8, 4, 3, 22, 13, 13, 2, 5, 7, 5, 6, 4, 1, 10, 2, 22, 11, 2\n\nThe last three differences are 22, 11, 2. We see the pattern of a number followed by its half (22, 11). The next difference is 2. There is no obvious simple rule to get 2 from 11.\n\nGiven the complexity and the lack of a clear mathematical progression, and without further context, a definitive answer is not possible. However, if a simple continuation is assumed, repeating the last difference is a plausible guess.\n\nThe last difference is 12.\nNext Number = 2352 + 12 = 2364.\n\n<<<2364>>>"
