    "For a higher dimensional rooted forest $(F,R)$ of a triangulated d-manifold to simplicially collapse onto its root $R$, the relative homology group $H_{d-1}(F, R)$ must be trivial. The standard triangulation of the Möbius band is a 2-manifold (d=2), so the relevant condition is that the relative homology group $H_1(F, R)$ must be trivial.\n\nThe Möbius band is a non-orientable manifold. For non-orientable manifolds, it is possible to have rooted forests that do not simplicially collapse. This occurs when the forest $F$ contains torsion in its homology that is not present in the root $R$.\n\nIn the case of the standard triangulation of the Möbius band, there is precisely one such rooted forest that fails to simplicially collapse onto its root. This specific case is the rooted forest $(F, R)$ where the forest $F$ consists of all the 2-simplices (the triangles) of the entire triangulation, and its corresponding root $R$ is the boundary of the Möbius strip. For this pair, the relative homology group $H_1(F, R)$ is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$, which is non-trivial. The existence of this single non-collapsible rooted forest is a direct consequence of the non-orientability of the Möbius strip.\n\n<<<1>>>"
