    "In the framework of renormalization group theory, the scaling exponent α for the specific heat of a system near its critical point can be determined using the epsilon (ε) expansion. This method involves carrying out calculations in d = 4 - ε dimensions, where 4 is the upper critical dimension for the system, and then setting ε to the desired value.\n\nFor a system with a one-component order parameter, such as the Ising model, in a spatial dimension d=3, the parameters are:\n*   The number of spin components, n = 1.\n*   The upper critical dimension, d_c = 4.\n*   The expansion parameter, ε = d_c - d = 4 - 3 = 1.\n\nThe epsilon expansion for the specific heat exponent α for the O(n)-vector model is given, to the first order in ε, by the formula:\nα = (4 - n) / (2 * (n + 8)) * ε + O(ε²)\n\nSubstituting the values n=1 and ε=1 for the three-dimensional Ising model universality class, we get:\n\nα = (4 - 1) / (2 * (1 + 8)) * 1\nα = 3 / (2 * 9)\nα = 3 / 18\nα = 1/6\n\nIt is important to note that the epsilon expansion is an asymptotic series. While setting ε=1 is a significant extrapolation from ε << 1, the first-order result provides a good qualitative estimate that differs from the mean-field prediction (α=0). Higher-order corrections can be calculated, but they do not necessarily improve the numerical accuracy when ε=1 without using more sophisticated resummation techniques. Based on the direct application of the first-order epsilon expansion, the value is 1/6.\n\n<<<1/6>>>"
