    "To determine the central pixel of a line between coordinates (1,1) and (11,5) using Bresenham's line algorithm, we first need to calculate all the integer pixel coordinates along the line's path. Bresenham's algorithm is a method that efficiently determines which pixels on a two-dimensional grid should be plotted to form a close approximation of a straight line between two points. It achieves this using only integer addition, subtraction, and bit shifting, making it a fast and widely used algorithm in computer graphics.\n\nHere are the steps to find the pixel coordinates for the line from (1,1) to (11,5):\n\n1.  **Calculate the change in x and y:**\n    *   Δx = 11 - 1 = 10\n    *   Δy = 5 - 1 = 4\n\n2.  **Initialize the decision parameter:**\n    *   The initial decision parameter (p) is calculated as p = 2 * Δy - Δx.\n    *   p = 2 * 4 - 10 = -2\n\n3.  **Iterate and determine each pixel:**\n    *   Starting from (1,1), we plot each subsequent pixel by incrementing x by 1. The y-coordinate is either incremented or remains the same based on the value of the decision parameter.\n    *   If the parameter `p` is less than 0, the next point is (x+1, y), and the new `p` becomes `p + 2 * Δy`.\n    *   If the parameter `p` is greater than or equal to 0, the next point is (x+1, y+1), and the new `p` becomes `p + 2 * Δy - 2 * Δx`.\n\nFollowing these rules, the sequence of pixels generated for the line is:\n(1,1), (2,1), (3,2), (4,2), (5,3), (6,3), (7,3), (8,4), (9,4), (10,5), (11,5)\n\nThere are a total of 11 pixels in the line. The central pixel is the 6th pixel in this sequence.\n\nThe coordinates of the 6th pixel are (6,3).\n\n<<<(6, 3)>>>"
