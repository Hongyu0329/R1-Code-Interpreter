    "Andrei Voznesensky immortalized Nikolai Rezanov in his 1970 poem \"Avos!\" (\"Авось!\"), which was later adapted into the famous rock opera \"Juno and Avos.\" The English translation of the poem was published under the title \"Story Under Full Sail.\"\n\nThe question of Rezanov's final resting place was a long-standing mystery. He died in Krasnoyarsk in 1807, and while a monument was erected in 1831, his original grave at the Voskresensky Cathedral was destroyed by the Bolsheviks. For many years, the exact location of his remains was unknown, prompting Voznesensky's poignant line.\n\nThe answer to the poet's question began to emerge in the late 1980s, during the period of Glasnost, which allowed for greater historical inquiry. It was during this time that archival research and archaeological work intensified, leading to the confirmation of the site of Rezanov's grave. This culminated in the eventual re-interment of his remains and the dedication of a new monument at the Trinity Churchyard in Krasnoyarsk in 2000.\n\n<<<Rezanov>>>"
