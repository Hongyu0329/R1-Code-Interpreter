    "This is a problem concerning the chromatic number of a graph. Let $n=12345$ be the number of vertices in the graph $G$. We are given that $G$ is not a complete graph. We want to find the maximum possible value for the chromatic number, $\\chi(G)$.\n\nFirst, let's establish an upper bound for the number of colors.\nSince $G$ is not a complete graph, there must exist at least one pair of vertices, let's call them $u$ and $v$, that are not connected by an edge. Because there is no edge between $u$ and $v$, they can be assigned the same color in a proper coloring.\n\nWe can define a coloring strategy based on this. Let's merge the vertices $u$ and $v$ into a single new vertex, let's call it $w$. The resulting graph, $G'$, has $n-1$ vertices. The maximum number of colors needed for any graph with $n-1$ vertices is $n-1$ (for example, by assigning a unique color to each vertex). So, we can find a proper coloring for $G'$ using at most $n-1$ colors.\n\nThis coloring of $G'$ can be directly translated back to a proper coloring of the original graph $G$. We assign the color of the merged vertex $w$ to both $u$ and $v$, and all other vertices in $G$ retain their colors from $G'$. This is a proper coloring for $G$ because:\n1.  Any two adjacent vertices in $G$ (neither of which is $u$ or $v$) are also adjacent in $G'$ and thus have different colors.\n2.  Any vertex adjacent to $u$ or $v$ in $G$ is adjacent to $w$ in $G'$ and will have a different color.\n3.  Since $u$ and $v$ are not adjacent in $G$, assigning them the same color is valid.\n\nTherefore, any graph with $n=12345$ vertices that is not complete can be colored with at most $n-1 = 12344$ colors.\n\nNext, we need to show that this maximum of 12344 is achievable. To do this, we must construct a graph with 12345 vertices that is not complete and requires exactly 12344 colors.\n\nConsider the graph $G$ formed by the disjoint union of a complete graph on 12344 vertices ($K_{12344}$) and a single isolated vertex ($K_1$).\n*   This graph has a total of $12344 + 1 = 12345$ vertices.\n*   It is not a complete graph because the isolated vertex is not connected to any other vertex.\n*   The chromatic number of this graph is the maximum of the chromatic numbers of its connected components. The two components are $K_{12344}$ and $K_1$.\n    *   A complete graph with $k$ vertices, $K_k$, requires $k$ colors for a proper coloring. Thus, $\\chi(K_{12344}) = 12344$.\n    *   A single vertex, $K_1$, requires 1 color. Thus, $\\chi(K_1) = 1$.\n*   The chromatic number of our constructed graph $G$ is therefore $\\max(12344, 1) = 12344$.\n\nSince we have shown that any such graph needs at most 12344 colors, and we have found a specific graph that needs exactly 12344 colors, the maximum number of colors is 12344.\n\n<<<12344>>>"
