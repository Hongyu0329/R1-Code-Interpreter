    "A wooden stick, hanging a square box, a ladder placed in the center is a riddle that refers to the Chinese character **困** (kùn).\n\nThis character is a pictogram that visually represents the elements described in the riddle:\n\n*   **The square box:** The outer radical \"囗\" (wéi) depicts an enclosure or a box.\n*   **The wooden stick and the ladder:** The inner radical \"木\" (mù) means \"wood\" or \"tree\". In the context of the riddle, \"木\" is creatively interpreted as both a wooden stick and a ladder in the center of the box.\n\nThe character **困 (kùn)** has several meanings, including \"to be trapped,\" \"to be surrounded,\" \"hard-pressed,\" or \"sleepy.\" The visual representation of a tree being confined within a box vividly conveys this sense of being restricted or in a difficult situation.\n\nWord riddles, known as \"字谜\" (zì mí) in Chinese, are a common and playful way to teach and understand the composition of Chinese characters. These riddles often break down characters into their constituent parts and use descriptive and sometimes metaphorical language to hint at the final answer.\n\n<<<困>>>"
