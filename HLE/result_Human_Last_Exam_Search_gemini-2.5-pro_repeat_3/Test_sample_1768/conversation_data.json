    "To determine the correct reading frame and translate the provided nucleotide sequence, we must translate it in all three possible forward reading frames. Since the sequence is from the middle of an Open Reading Frame (ORF), the correct frame will be the one that does not contain any stop codons (TAA, TAG, or TGA).\n\nThe provided nucleotide sequence is:\n`ggacattgttgttagcgaagacttgaatggaacggtgaagttttcaagctctttaccctaccccaataatcttaacagtgtcctggctgagcgactggagaagtggc`\n\nLet's analyze the three reading frames:\n\n*   **Frame 1 (starting from the 1st nucleotide):**\n    `gga cat tgt tgt tag cga aga...`\n    The fifth codon, `tag`, is a stop codon. Therefore, this is not the correct reading frame.\n\n*   **Frame 2 (starting from the 2nd nucleotide):**\n    `gac att gtt gtt agc gaa gac ttg aat gga acg gtg aag ttt tca agc tct tta ccc tac ccc aat aat ctt aac agt gtc ctg gct gag cga ctg gag aag tgg`\n    Translating these codons using the standard genetic code gives the following amino acid sequence:\n    D - I - V - V - S - E - D - L - N - G - T - V - K - F - S - S - L - Y - P - T - P - N - N - L - N - S - V - L - A - E - R - L - E - K - W\n    This frame has no stop codons.\n\n*   **Frame 3 (starting from the 3rd nucleotide):**\n    `aca ttg ttg tta gcg aag act tga atg gaa...`\n    The eighth codon, `tga`, is a stop codon. Therefore, this is not the correct reading frame.\n\nBased on this analysis, the second reading frame is the only one that is \"open\" (free of stop codons), which is consistent with the sequence being from the middle of an ORF.\n\nThe correct frame is Frame 2, and the resulting protein sequence is:\n<<<DIVVSEDLNGTVKFSSLYPTPNNLNSVLAERLEKW>>>"
