    "The number of subgroups of index 4 in the Grigorchuk group is 7.\n\nThe Grigorchuk group, denoted by G, is a finitely generated group. The number of subgroups of a given index can be determined by considering the possible quotient groups of that order. For index 4, the possible quotient groups are the cyclic group of order 4 (denoted as Z₄) and the Klein four-group (denoted as V₄, which is isomorphic to Z₂ × Z₂).\n\nThe number of subgroups of a specific index is calculated by determining the number of surjective homomorphisms from the Grigorchuk group to each of the possible quotient groups of that order, and then dividing by the order of the automorphism group of the quotient group.\n\n1.  **Abelianization of the Grigorchuk Group:** A crucial step is to determine the abelianization of the Grigorchuk group, which is the quotient group G/[G,G], where [G,G] is the commutator subgroup. The Grigorchuk group is generated by four involutions (elements of order 2) denoted as a, b, c, and d. A smaller generating set is {a, b, c}. In the abelianization, all elements commute. Since the generators are all of order 2, the abelianization must be an abelian group where every non-trivial element has order 2. Such a group is a vector space over the field of 2 elements, F₂. The abelianization of the Grigorchuk group is (Z₂)³, which is the direct product of three cyclic groups of order 2.\n\n2.  **Homomorphisms to Z₄:** Any homomorphism from the Grigorchuk group to an abelian group must factor through its abelianization, G/[G,G] = (Z₂)³. Thus, we consider homomorphisms from (Z₂)³ to Z₄. Let φ be such a homomorphism. For any element g in (Z₂)³, g² is the identity. Therefore, φ(g)² must be the identity in Z₄. The elements in Z₄ whose order divides 2 are 0 and 2. This means the image of any homomorphism from (Z₂)³ to Z₄ must be a subgroup of {0, 2}, which is isomorphic to Z₂. Consequently, there are no surjective homomorphisms from the Grigorchuk group to Z₄. This implies there are no subgroups of index 4 with a quotient isomorphic to Z₄.\n\n3.  **Homomorphisms to V₄ (Klein four-group):** The Klein four-group V₄ is isomorphic to Z₂ × Z₂. We need to find the number of surjective homomorphisms from the Grigorchuk group G to V₄. This is equivalent to finding the number of surjective homomorphisms from its abelianization, (Z₂)³, to V₄ ≅ (Z₂)².\n\nA homomorphism from (Z₂)³ to (Z₂)² is determined by where it maps the three generators of (Z₂)³. Each generator can be mapped to any of the four elements of (Z₂)², leading to a total of 4³ = 64 possible homomorphisms.\n\nTo find the number of *surjective* homomorphisms, we can subtract the number of non-surjective ones. A homomorphism is not surjective if its image is a proper subgroup of (Z₂)². The proper subgroups are the trivial group {e} and the three subgroups of order 2.\n*   **Trivial image:** There is only one homomorphism that maps every element to the identity.\n*   **Image of order 2:** There are three subgroups of order 2 in V₄. For each of these, there are 2³ - 1 = 7 non-trivial homomorphisms from (Z₂)³ to it. This gives a total of 3 × 7 = 21 homomorphisms whose image is a subgroup of order 2.\n\nTherefore, the number of non-surjective homomorphisms is 1 + 21 = 22. The number of surjective homomorphisms is the total number of homomorphisms minus the non-surjective ones: 64 - 22 = 42.\n\nThe number of subgroups of index 4 with a quotient isomorphic to V₄ is the number of surjective homomorphisms divided by the order of the automorphism group of V₄. The automorphism group of V₄ is Aut(Z₂ × Z₂) ≅ GL₂(F₂), which has an order of (2² - 1)(2² - 2¹) = 6.\n\nSo, the number of subgroups of index 4 is 42 / 6 = 7.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   Number of subgroups with quotient Z₄: 0\n*   Number of subgroups with quotient V₄: 7\n\nThe total number of subgroups of index 4 in the Grigorchuk group is 0 + 7 = 7.\n\n<<<7>>>"
