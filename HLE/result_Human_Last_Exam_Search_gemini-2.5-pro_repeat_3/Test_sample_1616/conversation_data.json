    "Trisyllabic laxing is a sound change in English where a tense vowel (a long vowel or diphthong) becomes a lax vowel (a short vowel) when it is in the antepenultimate (third from the end) syllable of a word. This process is responsible for the vowel differences in word pairs like *serene* /səˈriːn/ → *serenity* /səˈrɛnəti/ and *divine* /dɪˈvaɪn/ → *divinity* /dɪˈvɪnɪti/.\n\nLet's analyze the given words:\n*   **southern**: This two-syllable word is derived from \"south.\" The vowel changes from the diphthong /aʊ/ to the lax vowel /ʌ/. While this is a vowel shortening process, it is not *trisyllabic* laxing because the word is not three syllables long.\n*   **derivative**: This word comes from \"derive,\" where the vowel is a tense diphthong /aɪ/. In \"derivative\" /dɪˈrɪvətɪv/, the vowel in the antepenultimate syllable has become the lax vowel /ɪ/, which is a clear example of trisyllabic laxing.\n*   **serenity**: This word is derived from \"serene,\" which has a tense vowel /iː/. In \"serenity\" /səˈrɛnəti/, this vowel becomes the lax vowel /ɛ/ in the third-to-last syllable, a classic case of trisyllabic laxing.\n*   **pleasant**: This two-syllable word comes from \"please,\" which has a tense vowel /iː/. \"Pleasant\" /ˈplɛzənt/ contains a lax vowel /ɛ/. Like \"southern,\" this demonstrates vowel shortening in a two-syllable word, not trisyllabic laxing.\n*   **gratitude**: This three-syllable word's first syllable contains the lax vowel /æ/. It is related to words like \"grateful,\" which has a tense vowel /eɪ/, and the Latin root *grātus*, which had a long (tense) 'a'. The change to a lax vowel in the antepenultimate syllable fits the pattern of trisyllabic laxing.\n*   **shadow**: This two-syllable word comes from the Old English *sceadu*. Its vowel was short in Old English and there is no related form with a tense vowel from which it was derived through suffixation that would trigger laxing. Therefore, it has not undergone this phonological process.\n\nBased on the analysis, `derivative`, `serenity`, and `gratitude` have undergone trisyllabic laxing. `Southern` and `pleasant` have undergone a similar process of vowel shortening, but in disyllabic (two-syllable) words, so it is not technically *trisyllabic* laxing. `Shadow` is the only word on the list whose historical development does not involve this type of vowel shortening from a tense counterpart at all.\n\n<<<shadow>>>"
