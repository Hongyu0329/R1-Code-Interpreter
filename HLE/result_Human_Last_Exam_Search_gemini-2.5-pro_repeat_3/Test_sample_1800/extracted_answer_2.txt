The ideal Ni/Ce ratio for Ni-Ceria nanoparticles is dependent on the specific application. For the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction, an optimal range is typically between 7-12.5% nickel loading. For water splitting, particularly the Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER), a higher nickel content is favored, with optimal Ni/Ce molar ratios being reported at 1:1 and 3:1. For overall water splitting using bifunctional catalysts, a Ni/Ce molar ratio of 0.5 has also been identified as ideal.
