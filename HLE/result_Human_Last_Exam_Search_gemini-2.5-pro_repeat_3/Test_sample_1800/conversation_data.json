    "Determining the ideal Ni/Ce ratio for maximizing the catalytic performance of Ni-Ceria nanoparticles is crucial for both the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction and water splitting (WS). The optimal ratio is highly dependent on the specific reaction, preparation method, and the presence of other promoting elements.\n\n### Water Gas Shift (WGS) Reaction\n\nFor the WGS reaction, the ideal nickel content is generally found in the range of 7 to 12.5% in relation to ceria.\n\n*   **Optimal Ni Molar Proportion**: Research on Ni/La-doped Ceria catalysts for the reverse WGS reaction identified an optimal Ni molar proportion of around 7% (molar ratio y = 0.07). Increasing the Ni loading to 10% molar resulted in similar CO2 conversion and CO selectivity.\n*   **Higher Nickel Loadings**: Studies using Ni/CeO2 catalysts without additional dopants have shown that CO conversion increases with nickel content from 5 to 12.5 wt %. Specifically, at 400 °C, catalysts with 10 and 12.5 wt % Ni exhibited nearly identical high conversion rates of 94.7% and 95.3%, respectively.\n*   **Influence of Co-dopants**: When tungsten is introduced as a co-dopant, a catalyst with a composition of Ni0.2W0.1Ce0.7O2 (a Ni/Ce molar ratio of approximately 0.286) displayed the highest catalytic activity. Other studies have also shown excellent performance with 4-5% Ni loadings when promoted with other elements like Rhenium or Gadolinium.\n\n### Water Splitting (WS)\n\nIn the case of water splitting, particularly the Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER) which is often the performance-limiting step, a significantly different range of Ni/Ce ratios has been found to be optimal. The ideal ratio often favors a higher nickel content to create more active sites and oxygen vacancies.\n\n*   **High Nickel Content for OER**: A series of Ni<sub>y</sub>Ce<sub>100−y</sub>O<sub>x</sub> electrocatalysts were synthesized to find the best ratio for the OER. The Ni<sub>75</sub>Ce<sub>25</sub>O<sub>x</sub> (Ni/Ce molar ratio of 3) and Ni<sub>50</sub>Ce<sub>50</sub>O<sub>x</sub> (Ni/Ce molar ratio of 1) catalysts showed the highest activities. The enhanced performance was attributed to a larger concentration of oxygen vacancies. The Ni<sub>75</sub>Ce<sub>25</sub>O<sub>x</sub> catalyst, in particular, demonstrated remarkable long-term stability.\n*   **Optimal Ratio for Overall Water Splitting**: For bifunctional catalysts designed for overall water splitting (both Hydrogen Evolution Reaction, HER, and OER), a different optimum has been reported. In one study on Ni<sub>3</sub>N-CeO<sub>2</sub> catalysts, a Ce/Ni molar ratio of 2 (corresponding to a **Ni/Ce ratio of 0.5**) was found to be optimal for HER. The same catalyst, prepared with a Ni to Ce precursor molar ratio of 1:2, also showed excellent efficiency for overall water splitting.\n*   **Co-doped Ceria for Water Splitting**: In systems where ceria is co-doped with nickel and iron, a total dopant level of 20 mol% (with a Ni:Fe ratio of 1:1) into CeO<sub>2</sub> showed excellent HER and OER activities. This corresponds to a Ce:Ni:Fe molar ratio of 8:1:1, meaning a Ni/Ce ratio of 0.125. Another study on a NiFe-Ce catalyst reported a Ni:Fe:Ce molar ratio of 1:1:1 (a Ni/Ce ratio of 1) for effective water splitting.\n\nIn summary, the ideal Ni/Ce ratio is highly application-specific:\n\n*   For the **Water Gas Shift reaction**, a lower nickel content, typically in the range of **7-12.5%** (by weight or molar), is often optimal.\n*   For **water splitting**, especially for the OER, a significantly higher nickel content with **Ni/Ce molar ratios of 1 to 3** has proven most effective. However, for overall water splitting with bifunctional catalysts, an optimal **Ni/Ce molar ratio of 0.5** has also been reported as highly efficient.\n\n<<<The ideal Ni/Ce ratio for Ni-Ceria nanoparticles is dependent on the specific application. For the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction, an optimal range is typically between 7-12.5% nickel loading. For water splitting, particularly the Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER), a higher nickel content is favored, with optimal Ni/Ce molar ratios being reported at 1:1 and 3:1. For overall water splitting using bifunctional catalysts, a Ni/Ce molar ratio of 0.5 has also been identified as ideal.>>>"
