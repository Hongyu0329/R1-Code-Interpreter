    "The haiku describes the events leading to the surrender of Japan in August 1945.\n\n*   **\"An August tempest\"**: Refers to the \"storm\" of events in August 1945, including the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the Soviet invasion of Manchuria.\n*   **\"Twice fifteen brings winds of change\"**: This points to August 15, 1945, the date Emperor Hirohito's surrender announcement was broadcast to the Japanese people, ushering in the \"winds of change.\"\n*   **\"A divine one yields\"**: This is a reference to Emperor Hirohito, who was considered a divine figure in Japan, yielding to the Allied demands for surrender.\n\nThe title, \"The Bays,\" is a question referring to the location of the formal surrender ceremony. This event took place aboard the USS *Missouri* in Tokyo Bay on September 2, 1945. The question likely asks for the names of the Allied battleships present in the bay for this historic ceremony.\n\nThe Allied battleships present in Tokyo Bay were:\n*   USS Colorado (BB-45)\n*   HMS Duke of York (17)\n*   USS Idaho (BB-42)\n*   USS Iowa (BB-61)\n*   HMS King George V (41)\n*   USS Mississippi (BB-41)\n*   USS Missouri (BB-63)\n*   USS New Mexico (BB-40)\n*   USS South Dakota (BB-57)\n*   USS West Virginia (BB-48)\n\nIn alphabetical order, the answer is:\n<<<Colorado, Duke of York, Idaho, Iowa, King George V, Mississippi, Missouri, New Mexico, South Dakota, West Virginia>>>"
