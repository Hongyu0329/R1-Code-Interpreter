    "To determine the value of `log_2(n)`, we must first evaluate the Church integer `n` represented by the given SKI combinator expression. The process involves parsing the expression and applying the reduction rules of SKI calculus, particularly as they apply to Church numerals.\n\nThe expression is:\n`S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(S(S(K(S))(K))(I)))))(S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I)))`\n\n**1. Identifying the Church Numerals:**\n\nFirst, we identify the standard combinators for the successor function and the numerals 1, 2, and 3.\n*   **Successor (Succ):** The combinator `S(S(K(S))(K))` acts as the successor function (`n -> n+1`) when applied to a Church numeral.\n*   **One (I):** The identity combinator `I` is the standard representation of the Church numeral 1.\n*   **Two:** The expression contains two equivalent representations for the numeral 2:\n    *   `S(I)(I)` which reduces as `(S(I)(I)) f x = I f (I f) x = f (f x)`.\n    *   `Succ(I)` which is `S(S(K(S))(K))(I)`.\n*   **Three:** This is represented as `Succ(Two)`, which corresponds to the sub-expression `S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I))`.\n\nFor clarity, let's denote `TWO` as the Church numeral 2 and `THREE` as the Church numeral 3.\n\n**2. Simplifying the Expression:**\n\nSubstituting these back into the main expression, we get:\n`S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(TWO)))))(THREE)`\n\n**3. Parsing and Reduction:**\n\nIn SKI calculus, application is left-associative. The expression is parsed as `((S A) B) C`, which reduces to `A C (B C)`. However, the expression given is `S(I)(...)`, where `S(I)` itself can be treated as a single combinator. Let's analyze the expression as `(S(I) A) B`.\n\n*   `A = S(I)(S(I)(K(TWO)))`\n*   `B = THREE`\n\nThe combinator `S(I)` has the reduction rule: `S(I) f g = I f (f g) = f (f g)`.\nTherefore, `(S(I) A) B` reduces to `A (A B)`. So, the integer `n` is `A (A B)`.\n\nLet's evaluate the inner term `A B` first, which is `A(THREE)`.\n*   `A(THREE) = (S(I)(S(I)(K(TWO)))) (THREE)`\n*   This again has the form `(S(I) G) H` where `G = S(I)(K(TWO))` and `H = THREE`.\n*   This reduces to `G (G H)`.\n\nNow, let's evaluate `G H`, which is `G(THREE)`.\n*   `G(THREE) = (S(I)(K(TWO))) (THREE)`\n*   This reduces to `K(TWO) (K(TWO) THREE)`.\n*   The `K` combinator rule is `K x y = x`. So, `K(TWO) THREE = TWO`.\n*   Substituting back, we get `K(TWO) (TWO)`, which again reduces to `TWO`.\n*   Therefore, `G(THREE) = TWO`.\n\nNow we can evaluate `G (G H) = G(TWO)`.\n*   `G(TWO) = (S(I)(K(TWO))) (TWO)`\n*   This reduces to `K(TWO) (K(TWO) TWO) = K(TWO) (TWO) = TWO`.\n*   So, we have found that `A(THREE) = TWO`.\n\nFinally, we can evaluate the full expression `n = A (A B) = A(TWO)`.\n*   `A(TWO) = (S(I)(S(I)(K(TWO)))) (TWO)`\n*   This is the same function `A` we just evaluated, but applied to `TWO` instead of `THREE`. The result is the same.\n*   `A(TWO)` reduces to `G (G TWO)`.\n*   `G(TWO)` reduces to `K(TWO) (K(TWO) TWO) = TWO`.\n*   `G(G TWO)` becomes `G(TWO)`, which is `TWO`.\n*   So, `n = TWO`.\n\n**4. Calculating the Final Answer:**\n\nThe Church integer `n` represented by the complex expression simplifies to the Church numeral for 2. The question asks for the value of `log_2(n)`.\n*   `n = 2`\n*   `log_2(2) = 1`\n\n<<<1>>>"
