    "To determine the oligomeric state of the protein coiled-coil sequence `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG`, we must first identify the heptad repeat (`abcdefg`) pattern and then analyze the residues at the core `a` and `d` positions. These positions are typically occupied by hydrophobic residues and their specific identity and packing efficiency, through \"knobs-into-holes\" interactions, are the primary determinants of the oligomerization state.\n\n### 1. Identifying the Heptad Repeat\n\nA coiled-coil sequence is characterized by a seven-residue repeat, labeled `a` through `g`. The `a` and `d` positions form the hydrophobic core where the helices pack together. To find the correct \"frame\" for the repeat, we look for an alignment that places hydrophobic residues (like L, I, A, W) consistently at the `a` and `d` positions.\n\nLet's test different starting frames for the sequence `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG`:\n\n*   **Frame 1 (starting with `a`):** `G(a) E(b) I(c) A(d) ...` This places `G` and `K` at the `a` positions, which is unfavorable as `K` (Lysine) is charged.\n*   **Frame 2 (starting with `b`):** `G(b) E(c) I(d) A(e) ...` This places `I` (Isoleucine) at `d` and `L` (Leucine) at `a`. This is a very favorable hydrophobic pairing.\n\nLet's analyze the entire sequence with Frame 2:\n`G` `E I A Q S L` `K E I A K S L` `K E I A W S L` `K E I A Q S L` `K G`\n`b` `c d e f g a` `b c d e f g a` `b c d e f g a` `b c d e f g a` `b c d`\n\nThis alignment gives the following residues at the core `a` and `d` positions:\n*   **Position `a`:** L, L, L, L\n*   **Position `d`:** A, A, W, A\n\nThis registration results in a highly consistent and hydrophobic core, making it the most likely correct assignment.\n\n### 2. Analyzing Core Residues and Packing Efficiency\n\nThe identity of the amino acids at the `a` and `d` positions strongly influences the number of helices that will pack together.\n\n*   **Dimers (2 helices):** Are often formed when large hydrophobic residues like Leucine (L) are at the `d` position.\n*   **Trimers (3 helices):** Are often favored when beta-branched amino acids like Isoleucine (I) or Valine (V) are present at the `a` position, or when there is an even distribution of I and L at both `a` and `d` positions.\n*   **Tetramers (4 helices):** Are strongly indicated by having a small hydrophobic residue, specifically Alanine (A), at the `d` position and a larger one, like Leucine (L) or Isoleucine (I), at the `a` position.\n\nIn the given sequence, the overwhelming pattern is **Leucine (L) at the `a` position** and **Alanine (A) at the `d` position**. The small size of Alanine at the `d` position creates a \"hole\" that is too large to be efficiently packed in a dimer or trimer. However, it is perfectly suited for the tighter packing arrangement of a four-helix bundle, where the \"knob\" of a Leucine side chain from a neighboring helix fits snugly. The single bulky Tryptophan (W) at one `d` position can be accommodated within the tetrameric core formed by the other helices.\n\nTherefore, based on the principles of knobs-into-holes packing and the specific `a=L`, `d=A` pattern, the sequence is predicted to form a four-helix bundle.\n\nThe oligomeric state would be 4.\n\n<<<C>>>"
