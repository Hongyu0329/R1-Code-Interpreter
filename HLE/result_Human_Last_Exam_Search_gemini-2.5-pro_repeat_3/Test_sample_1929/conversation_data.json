    "The reaction between butadiene and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene results in a competitive cycloaddition, yielding two main products: a [4+2] cycloaddition product and a [2+2] cycloaddition product. This indicates that both a Diels-Alder reaction and a formal 1,2-addition take place.\n\nThe two products formed are:\n*   **4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohex-1-ene**: This is the product of the [4+2] cycloaddition, also known as the Diels-Alder reaction. In this reaction, the 1,3-butadiene acts as the diene and the 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene acts as the dienophile, forming a six-membered ring.\n*   **2,2-dichloro-1,1-difluoro-3-vinylcyclobutane**: This is the product of the [2+2] cycloaddition (or 1,2-addition). This reaction forms a four-membered ring.\n\nWhile both reactions occur, studies on the cycloaddition of 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene with various dienes indicate that the formation of the [2+2] adduct is a significant and often predominant pathway. This preference for the formation of a cyclobutane derivative is a known characteristic of many fluoroalkenes in cycloaddition reactions. These reactions are thought to proceed through a diradical intermediate.\n\nTherefore, the reaction produces a mixture of 4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohex-1-ene and 2,2-dichloro-1,1-difluoro-3-vinylcyclobutane.\n\n<<<The reaction between butadiene and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene yields a mixture of two main products: 4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohex-1-ene and 2,2-dichloro-1,1-difluoro-3-vinylcyclobutane."
