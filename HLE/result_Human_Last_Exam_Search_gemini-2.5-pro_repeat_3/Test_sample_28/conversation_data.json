    "The search results confirm the basic definitions of VC dimension and provide examples for various hypothesis classes. They do not, however, contain a direct answer for the specific class $H_{z-ones}$. My derivation from first principles seems to be the correct approach. The logic I used is consistent with the methods described in the search results for calculating VC dimension: to find the largest $d$ for which a set of that size can be shattered, one must show that there exists a set of size $d$ that can be shattered and that no set of size $d+1$ can be shattered.\n\nMy analysis did exactly this:\n1.  I showed that for a set of size $d$ to be shattered, the conditions $d \\le z$ and $d \\le T-z$ must hold for all possible labelings. This implies that the VC dimension is at most $\\min(z, T-z)$.\n2.  I then showed that any set of size $d = \\min(z, T-z)$ can be shattered by demonstrating that for any labeling of such a set, a valid hypothesis exists in $H_{z-ones}$. This implies that the VC dimension is at least $\\min(z, T-z)$.\n\nCombining these two points confirms that the VC dimension is exactly $\\min(z, T-z)$. The reasoning is sound and requires no external, class-specific theorems, relying only on the fundamental definition of VC dimension.\n\nThe problem is defined over a finite domain $X$ of size $T$. The hypothesis class $H_{z-ones}$ consists of all functions $h: X \\to \\{0,1\\}$ such that the number of inputs mapped to 1 is exactly $z$, i.e., $|\\{x \\in X : h(x)=1\\}| = z$.\n\nTo determine the VC dimension, we need to find the size of the largest set of points $S \\subseteq X$ that can be shattered by $H_{z-ones}$. A set $S$ of size $d$ is shattered if for every possible binary labeling of the points in $S$, there is a hypothesis $h \\in H_{z-ones}$ that produces this labeling.\n\nLet $S$ be a set of $d$ points from $X$. For $S$ to be shattered, for any of the $2^d$ possible labelings of $S$, we must be able to find a corresponding function in $H_{z-ones}$.\n\nConsider a specific labeling for the points in $S$. Let this labeling have $k$ points assigned the value '1' and $d-k$ points assigned '0', where $0 \\le k \\le d$. For this labeling to be realized by a hypothesis $h \\in H_{z-ones}$, two conditions must be met:\n1. The hypothesis $h$ must match the labeling on $S$.\n2. The total number of points in $X$ for which $h(x)=1$ must be exactly $z$.\n\nFrom the first condition, $h$ must assign '1' to $k$ points within $S$. To satisfy the second condition, $h$ must therefore assign '1' to exactly $z-k$ points in the complement set $X \\setminus S$. The size of this complement set is $T-d$.\n\nFor it to be possible to assign $z-k$ ones to the points in $X \\setminus S$, the number of points we need to select ($z-k$) must be between 0 and the number of available points ($T-d$). This gives us the inequalities:\n1.  $z-k \\ge 0 \\implies k \\le z$\n2.  $z-k \\le T-d \\implies d-k \\le T-z$\n\nFor the set $S$ of size $d$ to be shattered, these two inequalities must hold for *every* possible labeling of $S$, which means they must hold for all possible values of $k$ from $0$ to $d$.\n\nLet's analyze the constraints on $d$:\n1.  The inequality $k \\le z$ must hold for all $k \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, d\\}$. The most stringent case is when $k$ is maximal, i.e., $k=d$. This implies we must have $d \\le z$.\n2.  The inequality $d-k \\le T-z$ must also hold for all $k \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, d\\}$. The left side is maximized when $k$ is minimal, i.e., $k=0$. This implies we must have $d-0 \\le T-z$, which simplifies to $d \\le T-z$.\n\nFor a set of size $d$ to be shattered, both conditions must be met. Therefore, $d$ must be less than or equal to both $z$ and $T-z$. This means the size of any shatterable set is bounded by $\\min(z, T-z)$. Consequently, the VC dimension is at most $\\min(z, T-z)$.\n\nNow, we must show that a set of size $d = \\min(z, T-z)$ *can* be shattered. Let's pick any set $S$ of this size. For any labeling of $S$ with $k$ ones (where $0 \\le k \\le d$), we need to show that we can extend it to a valid hypothesis in $H_{z-ones}$. This requires us to be able to choose $z-k$ points from $X \\setminus S$ to be labeled '1'. This is possible if $0 \\le z-k \\le T-d$.\n\nLet's verify these two conditions for $d = \\min(z, T-z)$:\n*   Is $k \\le z$? Yes, because $k \\le d$ and by our choice of $d$, we have $d \\le z$.\n*   Is $z-k \\le T-d$? This is equivalent to $d-k \\le T-z$. The maximum value of the left side is $d$ (when $k=0$). By our choice of $d$, we have $d \\le T-z$. Thus, the inequality holds for all $k \\le d$.\n\nSince both conditions hold for any labeling, any set of size $d=\\min(z, T-z)$ can be shattered.\n\nThis establishes that the VC dimension of $H_{z-ones}$ is exactly $\\min(z, T-z)$.\n\n<<<$\\min(z, T-z)$>>>"
