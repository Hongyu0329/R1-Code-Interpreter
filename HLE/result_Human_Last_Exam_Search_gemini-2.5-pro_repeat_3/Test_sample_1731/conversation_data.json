    "Using the framework of large deviation theory, the equilibrium properties of a gas of light quanta (photons), which are bosons, can be determined by finding the most probable macroscopic state. This is achieved by applying the Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramér-Chernoff theorems. These theorems provide a rigorous mathematical foundation for the principles of statistical mechanics, where equilibrium corresponds to the state of maximum entropy under given constraints. A recent study specifically utilizes these theorems to analyze the distributions of a Bose gas of photons, reproducing the foundational results of Bose and Planck within the large deviation framework.\n\n### Equilibrium Distribution via Boltzmann-Sanov Theorem\n\nThe Boltzmann-Sanov theorem is concerned with the probability that the empirical distribution of a sequence of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables deviates from the true underlying distribution. In the context of statistical mechanics, we consider the distribution of photons over various energy levels. The theorem states that the probability of observing a particular macroscopic distribution of particles, characterized by the occupation numbers `{n_i}` in energy states `{E_i}`, is exponentially small for any distribution that is not the equilibrium one. The rate of this exponential decay is governed by the relative entropy (or Kullback-Leibler divergence), which acts as the large deviation rate function.\n\nAt thermodynamic equilibrium, the system will be found in the macroscopic state that is most probable, which corresponds to the state that maximizes the entropy. For a system of bosons, the entropy S is given by:\nS = k_B * Σ_i [ (n_i + g_i - 1) * ln(n_i + g_i - 1) - n_i * ln(n_i) - (g_i - 1) * ln(g_i - 1) ]\nwhere `n_i` is the number of photons in the energy level `E_i`, `g_i` is the degeneracy of that level (the number of states with energy `E_i`), and `k_B` is the Boltzmann constant.\n\nFor a gas of light quanta, this maximization of entropy is subject to the constraint that the total energy of the system is constant:\nΣ_i n_i * E_i = U (Total Energy)\n\nA crucial characteristic of a photon gas in thermal equilibrium (such as black-body radiation) is that the number of photons is not conserved. Photons can be created and absorbed by the walls of the container. This lack of conservation of particle number means that the chemical potential (μ) for a photon gas is zero.\n\nMaximizing the entropy under the constraint of constant total energy (and with μ=0) using the method of Lagrange multipliers leads to the most probable distribution, which is the **Bose-Einstein distribution** for the average occupation number `n_i` of an energy state `E_i`:\n**n_i = g_i / (exp(E_i / (k_B * T)) - 1)**\n\nHere, `T` is the absolute temperature, which is introduced as the Lagrange multiplier associated with the energy constraint.\n\n### Equilibrium Values of Entropy and Mean Energy\n\nOnce the equilibrium distribution is known, the equilibrium values for entropy and mean energy can be calculated.\n\n**Equilibrium Entropy:**\n\nThe entropy of a Bose gas at equilibrium can be expressed in terms of the average occupation numbers `n_i`. By substituting the equilibrium values of `n_i` into the general formula for entropy, we obtain the equilibrium entropy of the photon gas. A common expression for the entropy of a Bose system is:\nS = k_B * Σ_i [ -n_i * ln(n_i) + (n_i + g_i) * ln(n_i + g_i) ]\n\nFor a continuous spectrum of energies, this sum becomes an integral over the density of states. For a photon gas in a volume V, the entropy is found to be:\n**S = (16 * σ * V * T^3) / (3 * c)**\nwhere σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant and c is the speed of light.\n\n**Equilibrium Mean Energy via Cramér-Chernoff Theorem:**\n\nThe Cramér-Chernoff theorem deals with large deviations of the sample mean of i.i.d. random variables. In statistical mechanics, this can be applied to the total energy of the system, which is the sum of the energies of the individual photons. The theorem provides the rate function for the probability that the average energy per particle deviates from its expected value. At equilibrium, the system will have the mean energy that minimizes this rate function.\n\nThe mean energy (U) of the photon gas is found by summing the energy of all occupied states, weighted by the Bose-Einstein distribution:\nU = Σ_i n_i * E_i = Σ_i (g_i * E_i) / (exp(E_i / (k_B * T)) - 1)\n\nFor a continuous distribution of energy states in a volume V, this sum is replaced by an integral over all frequencies, using the density of states for photons. This integration yields the Stefan-Boltzmann law for the total energy of black-body radiation:\n**U = (4 * σ / c) * V * T^4**\n\nThis is the celebrated result for the mean energy of a photon gas in equilibrium, which is directly obtained from the Bose-Einstein statistics derived through the large deviation framework.\n\n<<<\nThe equilibrium values for a Bose gas of light quanta, derived using large deviation theorems, are determined by the Bose-Einstein distribution which arises from maximizing the system's entropy.\n\nThe **equilibrium mean number of photons** `n_i` in an energy state `E_i` with degeneracy `g_i` at temperature `T` is given by the Bose-Einstein distribution:\n`n_i = g_i / (exp(E_i / (k_B * T)) - 1)`\n\nFrom this distribution, the **equilibrium mean energy (U)** for a photon gas in a volume V is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\n`U = (4 * σ / c) * V * T^4`\nwhere `σ` is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, `c` is the speed of light, and `T` is the absolute temperature.\n\nThe **equilibrium entropy (S)** is given by:\n`S = (16 * σ * V * T^3) / (3 * c)`\n>>>"
