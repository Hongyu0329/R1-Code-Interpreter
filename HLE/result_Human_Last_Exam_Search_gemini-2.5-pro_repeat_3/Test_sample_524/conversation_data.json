    "There are three homeomorphism classes of non-degenerate homogeneous planar continua. These are:\n\n*   **The circle:** The familiar simple closed curve.\n*   **The pseudo-arc:** A fractal-like, arc-like, and hereditarily indecomposable continuum. This means that it cannot be broken down into a finite union of proper subcontinua, and every one of its subcontinua that contains more than one point is also indecomposable. R. H. Bing showed in 1948 that the pseudo-arc is homogeneous.\n*   **The circle of pseudo-arcs:** This continuum can be thought of as a circle where each point is replaced by a pseudo-arc. It was shown to be a homogeneous planar continuum by Bing and Jones in 1959.\n\nThis complete classification was a long-standing problem in topology, finally solved by Logan Hoehn and Lex Oversteegen in 2014.\n\nIf one also considers degenerate continua (those consisting of a single point), then there is one additional homeomorphism class:\n\n*   **A point**\n\nThus, including the degenerate case, there are a total of four homeomorphism classes of homogeneous planar continua.\n\n<<<4>>>"
