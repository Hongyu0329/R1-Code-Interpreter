    "Under thermal conditions, the electrocyclization of (2Z,4Z,6Z,8E)-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene is a pericyclic reaction governed by the principles of Frontier Molecular Orbital (FMO) theory, which are also encapsulated in the Woodward-Hoffmann rules.\n\n### 1. Determining the Mode of Ring Closure\n\nFirst, we must determine the mode of ring closure (conrotatory or disrotatory). This is dictated by the number of π-electrons involved in the cyclization and the reaction conditions (thermal or photochemical).\n\n*   The reactant, (2Z,4Z,6Z,8E)-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene, has four double bonds in conjugation, which means it is an 8π-electron system.\n*   The number of π-electrons can be classified according to the Woodward-Hoffmann rules as either 4n or 4n+2, where n is an integer. An 8π-electron system corresponds to the 4n rule, with n=2.\n*   For thermal electrocyclic reactions, systems with 4n π-electrons undergo a **conrotatory** ring closure. This is because the Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO) of an 8π system (ψ₄) has terminal p-orbitals with opposite phases (antisymmetric). To achieve constructive, in-phase overlap to form the new sigma bond, the termini of the conjugated system must rotate in the same direction (conrotation).\n\n### 2. Predicting the Stereochemical Outcome\n\nElectrocyclic reactions are highly stereospecific. This means that a single stereoisomer of the reactant will form a single stereoisomer of the product (or a pair of enantiomers). The specific stereochemistry of the starting material, (2Z,4Z,6Z,8E)-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene, dictates the stereochemistry of the product.\n\nThe question states that two isomeric products, a *cis*-isomer (A) and a *trans*-isomer (B), are formed. This premise contradicts the fundamental principle of stereospecificity in pericyclic reactions, which predicts the formation of only one diastereomer. However, the task is to use FMO theory to predict the ratio. The most direct application of FMO theory leads to a prediction of a single, kinetically controlled product. The statement that two isomers are formed may be intended to test the understanding that the theory predicts a specific outcome, regardless of potential real-world complexities like thermodynamic control or competing reaction pathways not described by simple FMO theory.\n\nTo predict whether the product is *cis* or *trans*, we can analyze the steric interactions during the two diastereomeric conrotatory transition states, a concept known as torquoselectivity. This analysis is complex, but we can make a prediction based on analogy with similar systems.\n\nResearch has shown that the thermal conrotatory cyclization of a similar isomer, (2**E**,4Z,6Z,8E)-decatetraene, yields the **trans**-7,8-dimethyl-1,3,5-cyclooctatriene. Our starting material is (2**Z**,4Z,6Z,8E)-decatetraene. The only difference is the stereochemistry of the double bond at the C2 terminus.\n\nChanging the configuration of a double bond at one end of the reacting π-system from E to Z will reverse the orientation of the substituent (the methyl group) relative to the rest of the molecule as it enters the transition state. In a stereospecific reaction, changing the configuration of a reactant stereocenter will change the configuration of the product stereocenter. Therefore, if the (2E...) isomer gives the *trans* product, the (2Z...) isomer is predicted to give the *cis* product.\n\n### Conclusion based on FMO Theory\n\nFMO theory predicts that the thermal cyclization of (2Z,4Z,6Z,8E)-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene is a conrotatory process. This process is stereospecific, meaning it should yield a single diastereomeric product. By analogy with a closely related isomer, the predicted product is the *cis*-isomer A. Therefore, FMO theory predicts that the reaction should exclusively form isomer A.\n\nThe predicted ratio of A (cis-isomer) to B (trans-isomer) is **100:0**.\n\n<<<100:0>>>"
