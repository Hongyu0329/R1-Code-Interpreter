    "An 8x8 chessboard has 28 edge squares. This is calculated by counting the 8 squares on each of the four sides and subtracting the 4 corner squares that are counted twice (8 * 4 - 4 = 28).\n\nThe goal is to place the maximum number of bishops on these 28 squares so that no two bishops can attack each other. Bishops attack along diagonals of the same color. This means that the problem can be broken down into placing bishops on the 14 white edge squares and the 14 black edge squares independently.\n\nThe maximum number of non-attacking bishops that can be placed on an entire 8x8 board is 14. This number cannot be exceeded even when only using the edge squares. A valid arrangement that achieves this maximum on the edge squares is to place a bishop on every square of the 'a' file and every square of the 'h' file, except for two opposite corners that would attack each other. For instance, one can place bishops on squares a1 through a7 and h1 through h7. This places 14 bishops on the board, all on edge squares, and no two bishops attack one another.\n\nWith the maximum of 14 bishops placed on the edge squares, the number of edge squares that lack a bishop is:\n\nTotal edge squares - Number of placed bishops = 28 - 14 = 14.\n\nTherefore, 14 edge squares would be without a bishop.\n\n<<<14>>>"
