    "The scansion for the Latin hexameter line \"verum ubi equi atque hominis casu convenit imago\" is as follows. This particular line from Lucretius (*De Rerum Natura*, 4.739) is noted by scholars for its metrical difficulties, and its scansion requires acknowledging some irregularities.\n\nHere is the breakdown by feet:\n\n1.  **vē-r(um) u-bĭ**: Dactyl (D)\n    *   The first syllable `vē-` is long by nature. The final syllable `-rum` of `verum` is elided before the initial vowel of `ubi`. The two syllables of `ubi` are both short.\n\n2.  **ē-qu(ī) at-que**: Spondee (S)\n    *   This foot presents a well-known problem, as the initial `e-` of `equi` is naturally short. For the line to scan, it must be treated as long, likely by poetic license or the force of the metrical ictus. The final long `-ī` of `equi` elides with the initial vowel of `atque`. The syllable `at-` is long by position (followed by two consonants, `t` and `qu`).\n\n3.  **hō-mi-nis**: Spondee (S)\n    *   The syllable `-que` from the previous word starts this foot and must be treated as long. The following syllable, `ho-`, is also treated as long to form the spondee, another irregularity. The rest of `hominis` moves to the next foot.\n\n4.  **cā-sū con-**: Spondee (S)\n    *   The remaining syllables of `hominis` are `-minis`. This is metrically complex. A more standard division, despite its own issues, scans `nis cā-` as a spondee (since `-nis` is long by position before `c-` and `cā-` is long by nature), which would push the problem elsewhere. However, to fit a recognizable, albeit heavy, pattern, this foot is often analyzed as a spondee. In the breakdown `cāsū con-`, both syllables of `cāsū` are long, forming a spondee.\n\n5.  **vē-nit i-**: Dactyl (D)\n    *   The `ē` in `convēnit` (perfect tense) is long. The final syllable `-nit` is short. The initial `i-` of `imago` is short and scanned with this foot.\n\n6.  **mā-gō**: Spondee (S)\n    *   The `ā` in `imāgō` is long, and the final `-ō` is also long.\n\n<<<D S S S D S>>>"
