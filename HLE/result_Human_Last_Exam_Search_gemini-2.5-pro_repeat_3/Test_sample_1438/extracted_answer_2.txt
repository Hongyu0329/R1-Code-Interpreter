The value of the measure for a Grassmann variable integral is not a numerical constant but is defined by the anti-commuting property of the Grassmann variables (`ψᵢψⱼ = -ψⱼψᵢ` and `ψ² = 0`) and the Berezin integration rules (`∫ dψ = 0` and `∫ dψ ψ = 1`). These properties together enforce the anti-symmetrization of fermionic wavefunctions, which is the mathematical expression of the Pauli exclusion principle.
