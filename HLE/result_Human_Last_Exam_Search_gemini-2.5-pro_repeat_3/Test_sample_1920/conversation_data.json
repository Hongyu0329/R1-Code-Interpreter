    "To find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters $\\chi$ of conductor $d=53599$ and order 6, we first need to analyze the conductor and the structure of the character group.\n\n### 1. Prime Factorization of the Conductor\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of the conductor $d = 53599$.\nThrough calculation, we find that:\n$d = 53599 = 13 \\times 4123$\n\nTo ensure 4123 is a prime number, one could test for divisibility by primes up to $\\sqrt{4123} \\approx 64.2$. Checking these primes reveals that 4123 is indeed a prime number.\n\n### 2. Structure of Dirichlet Characters\nA Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $d = p_1 p_2$ (where $p_1$ and $p_2$ are distinct odd primes) can be uniquely expressed as a product of characters $\\chi_1$ and $\\chi_2$, where $\\chi_1$ is a character modulo $p_1$ and $\\chi_2$ is a character modulo $p_2$.\n\nThe character $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2$ is primitive modulo $d$ if and only if both $\\chi_1$ and $\\chi_2$ are primitive characters modulo their respective moduli. The conductor of a character modulo a prime $p$ is $p$ if the character is non-principal, and 1 if it is the principal character. Therefore, for $\\chi_1$ and $\\chi_2$ to be primitive, they must be non-principal characters.\n\n### 3. Order of the Character\nThe order of the character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of the component characters $\\chi_1$ and $\\chi_2$. We are looking for characters of order 6, so we need:\n$\\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_1), \\text{ord}(\\chi_2)) = 6$\n\nThe group of characters modulo a prime $p$, denoted $(\\mathbb{Z}/p\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$, is cyclic of order $\\phi(p) = p-1$. The number of characters of a specific order $k$ (where $k$ divides $p-1$) is $\\phi(k)$.\n\nFor our specific conductor $d = 13 \\times 4123$:\n*   The group of characters modulo 13 is cyclic of order $\\phi(13) = 12$.\n*   The group of characters modulo 4123 is cyclic of order $\\phi(4123) = 4122$.\n\nWe need to find the number of pairs of non-principal characters $(\\chi_1, \\chi_2)$ such that $\\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_1), \\text{ord}(\\chi_2)) = 6$. Let $o_1 = \\text{ord}(\\chi_1)$ and $o_2 = \\text{ord}(\\chi_2)$. The possible pairs of orders $(o_1, o_2)$ that result in an lcm of 6 are:\n*   (1, 6)\n*   (2, 3)\n*   (2, 6)\n*   (3, 2)\n*   (3, 6)\n*   (6, 1)\n*   (6, 2)\n*   (6, 3)\n*   (6, 6)\n\nThe number of characters $\\chi_i$ of order $k$ is $\\phi(k)$, provided that $k$ divides the order of the character group.\n\nFor the modulus $p_1=13$, the order of the character group is 12. The divisors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12. The number of characters for each possible order $o_1$ are:\n*   $N_1(1) = \\phi(1) = 1$ (This is the principal character, which is not primitive)\n*   $N_1(2) = \\phi(2) = 1$\n*   $N_1(3) = \\phi(3) = 2$\n*   $N_1(6) = \\phi(6) = 2$\n\nFor the modulus $p_2=4123$, the order of the character group is 4122. The prime factorization of 4122 is $2 \\times 3 \\times 687 = 2 \\times 3 \\times 3 \\times 229 = 2 \\times 3^2 \\times 229$. The divisors of 4122 include 1, 2, 3, and 6. The number of characters for each possible order $o_2$ are:\n*   $N_2(1) = \\phi(1) = 1$ (This is the principal character, which is not primitive)\n*   $N_2(2) = \\phi(2) = 1$\n*   $N_2(3) = \\phi(3) = 2$\n*   $N_2(6) = \\phi(6) = 2$\n\nSince a primitive character modulo a prime $p$ is any non-principal character, we must exclude cases where $o_1=1$ or $o_2=1$. This is because a character of order 1 is the principal character, which has a conductor of 1 and is thus not primitive.\n\nWe now calculate the number of pairs for the valid combinations of orders $(o_1, o_2)$:\n*   $N_1(2) \\times N_2(3) = 1 \\times 2 = 2$\n*   $N_1(2) \\times N_2(6) = 1 \\times 2 = 2$\n*   $N_1(3) \\times N_2(2) = 2 \\times 1 = 2$\n*   $N_1(3) \\times N_2(6) = 2 \\times 2 = 4$\n*   $N_1(6) \\times N_2(2) = 2 \\times 1 = 2$\n*   $N_1(6) \\times N_2(3) = 2 \\times 2 = 4$\n*   $N_1(6) \\times N_2(6) = 2 \\times 2 = 4$\n\nThe total number of primitive characters of order 6 is the sum of these counts:\nTotal = $2 + 2 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 4 + 4 = 20$.\n\n"
