    "An excellent competitive programming problem that tests fundamental C programming concepts, especially memory management. Here is the most memory-efficient C program to solve this task.\n\n### The C Program\n\nThe strategy for maximum memory efficiency is to:\n1.  Use character arrays (C-style strings) of the exact minimum required size. Since the strings can be up to 100 characters long, we need a buffer of size 101 to accommodate the string and the terminating null character (`\\0`).\n2.  Use the smallest possible data type for loop counters. As the string length is at most 100, a `char` type (1 byte) is sufficient for the loop index, instead of a more common `int` (typically 4 bytes).\n3.  Avoid creating extra variables to store intermediate results, such as the lowercase versions of characters, by performing the conversion and comparison in the same expression.\n\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <ctype.h>\n\n/*\n * This program compares two strings lexicographically, ignoring case.\n * It is designed to be as memory-efficient as possible.\n */\nint main() {\n    // Two character arrays to store the input strings.\n    // Size 101 is necessary for 100 characters + 1 for the null terminator.\n    // sizeof(char) is 1 byte. So, each array takes 101 bytes.\n    char s1[101];\n    char s2[101];\n\n    // Read both strings from standard input.\n    scanf(\"%s\", s1);\n    scanf(\"%s\", s2);\n\n    // A loop counter. 'char' is the most memory-efficient type for a counter\n    // up to 100, using only 1 byte.\n    char i = 0;\n\n    // Iterate through the strings character by character.\n    // The loop continues as long as we haven't reached the end of the string (the null terminator).\n    while (s1[i]) {\n        // Compare the lowercase versions of the characters at the current position.\n        if (tolower(s1[i]) < tolower(s2[i])) {\n            printf(\"-1\\n\");\n            return 0; // First string is smaller, print -1 and exit.\n        }\n        if (tolower(s1[i]) > tolower(s2[i])) {\n            printf(\"1\\n\");\n            return 0; // First string is larger, print 1 and exit.\n        }\n        // If characters are equal, move to the next one.\n        i++;\n    }\n\n    // If the loop finishes, it means all characters were identical.\n    printf(\"0\\n\");\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Memory Usage Calculation\n\nThe total memory `m` used for the variables in this program is calculated by summing the sizes of all declared variables. On a typical system, the sizes are:\n\n*   **`char s1[101];`**: An array of 101 characters, where each `char` is 1 byte.\n    *   Memory = `101 * sizeof(char)` = `101 * 1` = 101 bytes.\n*   **`char s2[101];`**: An array of 101 characters, where each `char` is 1 byte.\n    *   Memory = `101 * sizeof(char)` = `101 * 1` = 101 bytes.\n*   **`char i;`**: A single character variable used as a loop index.\n    *   Memory = `sizeof(char)` = 1 byte.\n\nThe total memory `m` is the sum of the memory used by these variables:\n\n`m = 101 (for s1) + 101 (for s2) + 1 (for i) = 203 bytes`\n\n<<<203>>>"
