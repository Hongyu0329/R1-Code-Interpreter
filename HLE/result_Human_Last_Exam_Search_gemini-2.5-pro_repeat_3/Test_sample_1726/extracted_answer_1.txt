In an alternative theory of relativity with a Euclidean spacetime metric, all five relativistic effects—relativity of simultaneity, length contraction, time dilation, the invariance of the speed of light, and non-Newtonian velocity addition—are generally considered to be true, although their conceptual origins differ from special relativity.

**1. Relativity of Simultaneity:** Yes, this would still be true.
**2. Relativity of Lengths:** Yes, this would still be true.
**3. Relativity of Time:** Yes, this would still be true.
**4. Invariance of the Speed of Light:** Yes, this is a feature, often re-contextualized as a universal 4D speed.
**5. Non-Newtonian Addition of Speeds:** Yes, this is necessary to respect the speed of light as a limit.

**6. Formula for Relativity of Lengths:**
$L = L_0 \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}$

**7. Formula for Relativity of Time:**
$Δt = \frac{Δt_0}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}$

**8. Formula for Non-Newtonian Addition of Speeds:**
The standard formula is often recovered: $u = \frac{v + u'}{1 + \frac{vu'}{c^2}}$
However, alternative formulations exist within different Euclidean models.
