R(s[n]) is not a simple recurrence relation based on a fixed number of preceding terms. Instead, it is an additive arithmetic function, where the value of the function for a number `n` is the sum of the function's values for the prime factors of `n`. Let `n = p_1^{a_1} * p_2^{a_2} * ... * p_k^{a_k}` be the prime factorization of `n`. Then `s[n] = a_1*s[p_1] + a_2*s[p_2] + ... + a_k*s[p_k]`. The values for the primes `s[p]` are taken from their first appearance in the sequence: `s[2]=1, s[3]=2, s[5]=2, s[7]=3, s[11]=8`, and so on. Note that the provided sequence S4 has some internal inconsistencies with this rule (e.g., for n=6, `s[6] = s[2] + s[3] = 1 + 2 = 3`, but the sequence lists 4).
