    "If the Norse had never invaded and interacted with the Anglo-Saxons, the Modern English word for \"sister\" would likely be **swester** or perhaps **suster**.\n\nThe modern word \"sister\" entered the English language in the mid-13th century, a result of the linguistic influence of the Norse (Viking) settlers. It comes from the Old Norse word *systir*. This imported word eventually replaced the native Old English term for a female sibling, which was ***sweostor*** or ***swuster***.\n\nBoth the Old Norse *systir* and the Old English *sweostor* originated from the same ancient source: the Proto-Germanic word **swestēr*, which itself came from the Proto-Indo-European **swésōr*. This shared ancestry is why many related languages have similar-sounding words for \"sister.\"\n\nTo understand what *sweostor* would have become in Modern English, we can look at two key factors:\n1.  **Natural Phonological Change:** Over centuries, unstressed vowel sounds at the end of English words often weakened. The final `-or` in *sweostor* would most likely have softened to an `-er` sound, a common evolution seen in words like *mōdor* (mother) and *fæder* (father). The `eo` vowel sound in the first syllable would have also changed, likely simplifying to an `e`.\n2.  **Cognates in Other Germanic Languages:** We can observe how the same Proto-Germanic root word evolved in other languages that did not have the same level of Norse influence. In modern German, the word is *Schwester*, and in Dutch, it is *zuster*, both of which are very close to the Old English *sweostor*.\n\nConsidering these linguistic pathways, the Old English *sweostor* would have most plausibly evolved into **\"swester.\"** A less likely, but still possible, development could have been **\"suster,\"** mirroring the Dutch form.\n\n<<<swester>>>"
