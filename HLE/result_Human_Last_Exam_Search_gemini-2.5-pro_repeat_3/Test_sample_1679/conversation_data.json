    "**\"An American in Paris,\" the 1951 Academy Award winner for Best Picture, is the first film to hold that honor and feature a depiction of the Luxor Obelisk.** The iconic Parisian landmark is visible in the movie's opening sequence, which establishes the film's setting.\n\nWhile the majority of \"An American in Paris\" was filmed on Hollywood soundstages, the production included several establishing shots of the French capital. One of these shots explicitly captures the Place de la Concorde, where the ancient Egyptian obelisk stands. A prop oil painting of the Luxor Obelisk at the Place de la Concorde was also created for the film, though it was not ultimately used in the final cut.\n\nPrior Best Picture winners, even those with storylines set in France such as \"The Life of Emile Zola\" (1937), were typically filmed on studio-built sets in the United States and do not feature on-location footage of the monument. For instance, \"The Life of Emile Zola\" was filmed on sets constructed by Warner Bros. in California, with no evidence of filming in Paris.\n\nThe Luxor Obelisk in Paris, originally from the Luxor Temple in Egypt, was erected in the Place de la Concorde in 1836. Its appearance in \"An American in Paris\" marks its first known on-screen presence in a film that would go on to win the Academy's highest honor.\n\nLater Best Picture winner, \"Around the World in 80 Days\" (1956), also features scenes in Paris, but there is no indication that the Place de la Concorde or the Luxor Obelisk are depicted.\n\n<<<An American in Paris>>>"
