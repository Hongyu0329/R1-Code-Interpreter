    "In the ϕ⁴ theory near four dimensions, specifically in d = 4 - ϵ dimensions, the leading order expression for the non-trivial fixed point coupling u∗, also known as the Wilson-Fisher fixed point, is given by:\n\nu∗ = (6ϵ) / (N+8)\n\nHere, ϵ = 4 - d is the small parameter controlling the expansion, and N is the number of components of the scalar field ϕ. This result is obtained by finding the non-trivial zero of the one-loop beta function for the coupling constant.\n\nThe beta function, which describes how the coupling constant u changes with the energy scale, is given to one-loop order by:\n\nβ(u) = -ϵu + [(N+8)/6]u² + O(u³)\n\nSetting β(u∗) = 0 yields two fixed points: the trivial Gaussian fixed point at u∗ = 0 and the non-trivial Wilson-Fisher fixed point which describes the critical behavior. For a single-component scalar field (N=1), the expression simplifies to:\n\nu∗ = (6ϵ) / 9 = (2/3)ϵ.\n\n<<<u* = 6ε / (N+8)>>>"
