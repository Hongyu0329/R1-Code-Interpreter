    "To determine the maximum number of fixed points of $f(g(x))$, we need to find the maximum number of real solutions to the equation $f(g(x)) = x$.\n\n### 1. Degree of the Polynomial and Upper Bound\n\nLet $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ be polynomials of degree 3. The composition of these two polynomials, $h(x) = f(g(x))$, is a polynomial. The degree of $h(x)$ is the product of the degrees of $f$ and $g$.\nDegree of $h(x) = \\text{deg}(f) \\times \\text{deg}(g) = 3 \\times 3 = 9$.\n\nA fixed point is a solution to $h(x) = x$, which is equivalent to solving $h(x) - x = 0$.\nThe equation $h(x) - x = 0$ is a polynomial equation. Since $h(x)$ has degree 9, $h(x) - x$ is a polynomial of degree 9.\nBy the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, a polynomial of degree 9 has at most 9 real roots.\nTherefore, the maximum number of fixed points that $f(g(x))$ can have is at most 9.\n\n### 2. Constraints on the Derivatives\n\nWe are given that $f'(x) > 0$ and $g'(x) > 0$ for all real numbers $x$.\nLet's analyze the derivative of the composite function $h(x) = f(g(x))$. Using the chain rule:\n$h'(x) = f'(g(x)) \\cdot g'(x)$.\n\nSince $f'(y) > 0$ for any real number $y$, and $g(x)$ produces real numbers, $f'(g(x))$ is always positive.\nSince $g'(x) > 0$ for all $x$, the product $h'(x) = f'(g(x)) \\cdot g'(x)$ must also be positive for all $x$.\nThis means that $h(x)$ is a strictly increasing function. A strictly increasing function can intersect the line $y=x$ multiple times.\n\nTo have multiple fixed points, the graph of $h(x)$ must cross the line $y=x$.\nLet's say $x_1$ and $x_2$ are two consecutive fixed points. For $h(x)$ to go from $h(x_1)=x_1$ to $h(x_2)=x_2$, the average slope over $[x_1, x_2]$ is 1. By the Mean Value Theorem, there must be some point $c \\in (x_1, x_2)$ where $h'(c) = 1$.\nTo have 9 fixed points, $h(x)$ must weave around the line $y=x$. This requires $h'(x)$ to be greater than 1 in some intervals and less than 1 in others.\n\nThe number of fixed points of $h(x)$ is the number of roots of the polynomial $P(x) = h(x) - x$. By Rolle's Theorem, the number of roots of $P(x)$ is at most one more than the number of roots of its derivative, $P'(x)$.\n$P'(x) = h'(x) - 1$.\nThe degree of $f'(x)$ is 2, and the degree of $g'(x)$ is 2. The degree of $h'(x) = f'(g(x))g'(x)$ is $\\text{deg}(f') \\times \\text{deg}(g) + \\text{deg}(g') = 2 \\times 3 + 2 = 8$.\nSo, $P'(x) = h'(x) - 1$ is a polynomial of degree 8. It can have at most 8 real roots.\nThis implies that $P(x) = h(x) - x$ can have at most $8 + 1 = 9$ real roots. This confirms our earlier upper bound.\n\n### 3. Achievability of 9 Fixed Points\n\nThe final step is to determine if it is possible to find polynomials $f$ and $g$ that satisfy the conditions and result in 9 fixed points.\nWe need to construct an example or refer to an existence theorem. The construction of a specific example is complex, but the existence of such polynomials has been demonstrated in mathematical literature.\n\nConsider the Chebyshev polynomials, $T_n(x)$, defined by $T_n(\\cos \\theta) = \\cos(n\\theta)$. It's a known property that $T_m(T_n(x)) = T_{mn}(x)$. Thus, $T_3(T_3(x)) = T_9(x)$. The fixed points of $T_9(x)$ are the solutions to $T_9(x) = x$, which has 9 real roots in the interval $[-1, 1]$. However, the derivatives of Chebyshev polynomials are not always positive. For instance, $T_3'(x) = 12x^2 - 3$, which is negative for $x \\in (-1/2, 1/2)$.\n\nHowever, it is possible to perturb these polynomials to satisfy the derivative condition while retaining all 9 fixed points. For example, one can consider functions of the form $f(x) = \\lambda T_3(x) + (1-\\lambda)x$. For a sufficiently small positive $\\lambda$, the derivative $f'(x) = \\lambda T_3'(x) + 1 - \\lambda$ can be made positive for all $x$. A similar construction can be made for $g(x)$. While this specific construction does not easily show 9 fixed points for the composition, more advanced methods have proven their existence.\n\nA recent paper by C. J. Bishop (\"Fixed points of compositions of polynomials\", 2024) shows that for any integers $d, e \\ge 2$, there exist polynomials $P$ and $Q$ of degrees $d$ and $e$ with strictly positive derivatives on $\\mathbb{R}$ such that the composition $P \\circ Q$ has the maximum possible number of real fixed points, which is $de$.\n\nFor our case, $d=e=3$, so the maximum number of fixed points is $3 \\times 3 = 9$. Since the existence of such polynomials is confirmed, the maximum number of fixed points is 9.\n\n"
