    "The number of involutions in the projective special unitary group PSU(4, 997) is given by the formula `q^4(q^2+1)(q^2-q+1)/2`, where `q = 997`.\n\nAn involution in a group is an element that is its own inverse. In the context of the projective special unitary group `PSU(n, q)`, involutions are elements `g` such that `g^2` is the identity. These elements arise from elements `x` in the special unitary group `SU(n, q)` where `x^2` is in the center of `SU(n, q)`.\n\nFor PSU(4, 997), the center of SU(4, 997) has two elements, `I` and `-I` (the identity matrix and its negative). Thus, an involution in PSU(4, 997) corresponds to a coset of an element `x` from SU(4, 997) where `x^2 = I` or `x^2 = -I`.\n\nA detailed analysis of the algebraic properties of the unitary group over the finite field with 997Â² elements reveals a crucial point: there are no elements `x` in SU(4, 997) such that `x^2 = -I`. This is because 997 is a prime congruent to 1 modulo 4.\n\nConsequently, all involutions in PSU(4, 997) must arise from elements `x` in SU(4, 997) for which `x^2 = I`. These are the involutions of SU(4, 997). These involutions are of two types: the central involution `-I`, and non-central involutions whose eigenvalues are `{-1, -1, 1, 1}`. The central involution corresponds to the identity element in PSU(4, 997) and is therefore not counted.\n\nThe number of non-central involutions in SU(4, 997) is given by the formula `q^4(q^2+1)(q^2-q+1)`, where `q=997`. Each pair of these involutions, `{x, -x}`, forms a single involution in PSU(4, 997). Therefore, the total number is half of the number of non-central involutions in SU(4, 997).\n\nSubstituting `q = 997` into the formula yields the number of involutions:\n\n`997^4 * (997^2 + 1) * (997^2 - 997 + 1) / 2`\n\nThis calculates to the specific value:\n\n`487,640,941,865,485,433,550,365`\n\n<<<487640941865485433550365>>>"
