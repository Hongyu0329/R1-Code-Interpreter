    "The largest number of components of the intersection of two closed connected subsets of the plane whose union is the unit square can be uncountably infinite, specifically having the cardinality of the continuum.\n\nThis can be demonstrated with the following construction:\n\n1.  **Define the sets:** Let the unit square be denoted by S = ×. We will use the standard ternary Cantor set, denoted by C, which is a subset of the interval.\n\n2.  **Construct the intersecting sets:**\n    *   Let the first set, A, be the union of the closed upper rectangle of the square and the points on the horizontal midline whose x-coordinates are in the Cantor set.\n        *   Mathematically, A = ( × [1/2, 1]) ∪ (C × {1/2}).\n    *   Let the second set, B, be the closed lower rectangle of the square.\n        *   Mathematically, B = × [0, 1/2].\n\n3.  **Verify the conditions:**\n    *   **Closed:** Both A and B are unions of closed sets, and are therefore closed.\n    *   **Connected:**\n        *   B is a rectangle, which is clearly connected.\n        *   A is connected because any two points in the upper rectangle can be connected within it. Any point in C × {1/2} can be connected to the upper rectangle via a vertical line, as the entire line segment × {1/2} is the lower boundary of the upper rectangle.\n    *   **Union is the unit square:** The union of A and B is ( × [1/2, 1]) ∪ (C × {1/2}) ∪ ( × [0, 1/2]). Since the Cantor set C is a subset of, the set C × {1/2} is contained within the union of the two rectangles, which is the entire square S. Thus, A ∪ B = S.\n\n4.  **Determine the intersection:** The intersection of A and B is the intersection of their defining parts:\n    *   A ∩ B = (( × [1/2, 1]) ∪ (C × {1/2})) ∩ ( × [0, 1/2]).\n    *   The intersection of the upper and lower rectangles is the midline, × {1/2}.\n    *   The intersection of C × {1/2} with the lower rectangle is also C × {1/2}.\n    *   Therefore, the total intersection is ( × {1/2}) ∩ (C × {1/2}), which simplifies to C × {1/2}.\n\n5.  **Count the components of the intersection:** The intersection is a copy of the Cantor set. A key property of the Cantor set is that it is totally disconnected, meaning its only connected components are its individual points. The number of points in the Cantor set is equal to the cardinality of the continuum, which is uncountably infinite (denoted as 2<sup>ℵ₀</sup>).\n\nSince the number of components can be uncountably infinite and cannot exceed the number of points in the square itself, the largest possible number of components is the cardinality of the continuum.\n\n<<<The cardinality of the continuum>>>"
