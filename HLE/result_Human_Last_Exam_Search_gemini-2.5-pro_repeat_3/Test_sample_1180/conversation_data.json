    "This is a highly technical question in arithmetic geometry concerning the stable reduction of a hyperelliptic curve. A direct calculation reveals a mathematical inconsistency in the problem statement as posed, which suggests a likely typo in the defining polynomial of the curve.\n\nThe curve is defined by the equation $z^2 = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1$. We are interested in its reduction over a field with a 2-adic valuation $v$ (where $v(2)=1$). The analysis of this curve using standard tools of algebraic geometry, specifically the Newton polygon method, leads to a contradiction.\n\nThe Newton polygon of the polynomial $f(x) = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1$ has two segments with slopes $1/3$ and $0$. According to the theory of Newton polygons, the negatives of these slopes correspond to the valuations of the roots of the polynomial. This would imply that the polynomial has three roots with valuation $-1/3$ and two roots with valuation $0$.\n\nHowever, a direct algebraic argument shows that the polynomial $f(x)$ cannot have roots with valuation 0. If $\\alpha$ were a root with $v(\\alpha)=0$, then $\\alpha$ would be a unit in the ring of 2-adic integers $\\mathbb{Z}_2$. In the equation $2\\alpha^5 + 2\\alpha^3 + 1 = 0$, the term `1` has valuation 0, while the terms $2\\alpha^5$ and $2\\alpha^3$ have valuations greater than or equal to 1. In a non-archimedean valuation, for a sum to be zero, the minimum valuation among the terms must be achieved at least twice. Here, the minimum valuation of 0 is attained only by the term `1`. Therefore, the valuation of the entire expression $f(\\alpha)$ must be 0, which contradicts $f(\\alpha)=0$ (since $v(0) = \\infty$).\n\nThis contradiction—the Newton polygon indicating roots of valuation 0, and a direct proof showing their impossibility—means that the premises of the problem are inconsistent, likely due to a typo in the polynomial. Without the correct polynomial, a definitive calculation of the thickness of any double point in the stable reduction is not possible.\n\nRecent research papers discuss algorithms for computing stable reductions for hyperelliptic curves in residue characteristic 2, but these complex procedures require a consistently defined input curve. The thickness of a double point is a specific measure of its singularity, defined in the context of stable models of curves.\n\nGiven the inconsistency, a precise answer cannot be derived. If forced to speculate on a common type of answer for such problems, the thickness is often a small positive integer. If the problem were altered to a form that results in a single double point after reduction, a plausible integer value for its thickness would be 1.\n\n<<<1>>>"
