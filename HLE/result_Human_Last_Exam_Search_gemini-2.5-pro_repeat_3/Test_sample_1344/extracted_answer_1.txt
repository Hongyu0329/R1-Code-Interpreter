An optimal single-site catalyst for both polyolefin degradation and olefin polymerization consists of a Group IV metal, specifically zirconium (Zr) or hafnium (Hf), supported on sulfated alumina (AlS). The catalyst precursor is typically an organometallic compound with simple alkyl ligands, such as tetrakis(neopentyl)zirconium (`Zr(CH₂C(CH₃)₃)₄`). The sulfated alumina acts as a highly Brønsted acidic support that generates the active cationic single-site species. This system is efficient for the hydrogenolysis of polyolefins into short saturated alkanes in the presence of hydrogen gas at elevated temperatures (150-200°C). The same catalytic site can perform olefin polymerization at lower temperatures and in the absence of significant hydrogen, following the principles of Ziegler-Natta catalysis. The direction of the reaction (polymerization vs. degradation) is primarily controlled by adjusting the reaction temperature and the partial pressure of hydrogen. For more precise control over the polymer properties during polymerization, the use of more complex ligands, such as those found in metallocene or post-metallocene catalysts, could be integrated, though their stability under the harsh hydrogenolysis conditions needs to be considered.
