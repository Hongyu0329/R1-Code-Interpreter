    "In Anton Chekhov's \"The Chameleon,\" the descriptions of Police Superintendent Otchumyelov's greatcoat serve as a recurring motif, symbolizing his vacillating and servile mentality. Chekhov describes the coat and Otchumyelov's interaction with it six times throughout the short story.\n\nThe six descriptions of the coat are:\n\n1.  **\"The police superintendent Otchumyelov is walking across the market square wearing a new overcoat...\"** This initial description establishes his official status and sense of self-importance.\n\n2.  **\"H'm! ... take off my coat, Yeldyrin... It's frightfully hot!\"** The first instance of the coat being removed coincides with the first shift in his opinion, when he believes the dog might belong to the General. His supposed overheating is a physical manifestation of his sudden panic and desire to appease a superior.\n\n3.  **\"Help me on with my overcoat, Yeldyrin, my lad... the wind's getting up... I'm cold...\"** When it seems the dog is not the General's, Otchumyelov's internal state shifts back. He feels a metaphorical \"chill\" at the prospect of having wrongly sided against the crowd and quickly has his coat put back on, reassuming his authoritative demeanor.\n\n4.  **\"Take it off... my coat.\"** Upon hearing again that the dog might be the General's, he once more feels \"hot\" and orders the coat to be removed, shedding his official skin to show deference.\n\n5.  **\"And you, you blockhead... put on my coat.\"** After the General's cook says the dog is not their master's, Otchumyelov quickly reverses his stance again, and the coat goes back on as he berates the victim.\n\n6.  **\"I'll make you smart yet!' Otchumyelov threatens him, and wrapping himself in his greatcoat, goes on his way across the square.\"** In the final scene, after it is revealed the dog belongs to the General's brother, Otchumyelov wraps himself in his coat, a final gesture of asserting his authority, now that he is confident in his alignment with the powerful.\n\nEach of these instances directly ties the state of the overcoat to Otchumyelov's rapidly changing judgments, making it a clear and effective symbol of his \"chameleon\" nature.\n\n<<<6>>>"
