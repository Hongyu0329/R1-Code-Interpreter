    "For a single-dose container ampule, the Beyond-Use Date (BUD) from the time of puncture in a sterile environment is for immediate use only. Once an ampule is opened, it cannot be stored for any period. Any unused portion of the medication must be discarded immediately after the preparation for the individual patient is complete.\n\nThis guideline is in place because ampules are designed for single use and cannot be sealed after being opened, which increases the risk of microbial contamination. This directive applies regardless of the air quality in which the ampule is opened.\n\nIt is important to distinguish between single-dose ampules and single-dose vials. While opened single-dose ampules must be used immediately, single-dose vials that have been punctured in a sterile environment (ISO Class 5 or better) may be used for up to 12 hours, according to some recent USP <797> guidelines, as long as storage requirements are met. However, if a single-dose vial is opened in an environment with air quality less than ISO Class 5, it must be used within one hour.\n\n<<<immediate use only>>>"
