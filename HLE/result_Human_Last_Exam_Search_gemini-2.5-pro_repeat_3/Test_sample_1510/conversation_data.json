    "There are four wallpaper groups with a point group of order 2.\n\nA wallpaper group is a mathematical classification of a two-dimensional repetitive pattern based on the symmetries within the pattern. In total, there are 17 distinct wallpaper groups. Each wallpaper group is associated with a point group, which describes the rotational and reflectional symmetries of the pattern.\n\nThe order of a point group refers to the number of symmetry operations it contains. A point group of order 2 has two symmetry operations: the identity operation and one other operation, which can be either a 180-degree rotation or a reflection.\n\nThe wallpaper groups are categorized based on their point groups. The point groups with an order of 2 are C₂ and D₁. The C₂ point group consists of the identity and a 180-degree rotation. The D₁ point group consists of the identity and a single reflection.\n\nThe four wallpaper groups that have a point group of order 2 are:\n*   **p2**: This group has a point group of C₂. Its symmetries include 180-degree rotations, but no reflections or glide reflections.\n*   **pm**: This group's point group is D₁. It contains reflection axes that are parallel to each other.\n*   **pg**: This group also has a point group of D₁. It is characterized by glide reflections.\n*   **cm**: The point group for this wallpaper group is also D₁. It features both reflections and glide reflections.\n\n<<<4>>>"
