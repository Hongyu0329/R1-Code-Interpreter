    "The maximal rank of the complementary channel of a Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ acting on a $d$-dimensional qudit is $d^2$.\n\nHere is a step-by-step derivation of this result:\n\n1.  **Pauli Channel and its Kraus Operators:**\n    A Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ acting on a $d$-dimensional quantum system (qudit) is defined as:\n    $\\Lambda(\\rho) = \\sum_{j=0}^{d^2-1} p_j U_j \\rho U_j^\\dagger$\n    where $\\{p_j\\}$ is a probability distribution ($p_j \\ge 0$ and $\\sum_j p_j = 1$), and $\\{U_j\\}_{j=0}^{d^2-1}$ are the generalized Pauli operators. These $d^2$ operators form a complete orthonormal basis for the space of $d \\times d$ matrices. The Kraus operators for this channel are $K_j = \\sqrt{p_j} U_j$.\n\n2.  **Complementary Channel and its Rank:**\n    For a channel $\\Lambda$ with Kraus operators $\\{K_j\\}$, the complementary channel $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$ describes the information that leaks to the environment. A key result in quantum information theory states that the rank of the complementary channel $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$ is equal to the rank of the Gram matrix $G$ of its Kraus operators. The entries of the Gram matrix are given by the Hilbert-Schmidt inner product of the Kraus operators:\n    $G_{ij} = \\text{Tr}(K_i^\\dagger K_j)$\n\n3.  **Calculating the Gram Matrix for a Pauli Channel:**\n    Substituting the Kraus operators for the Pauli channel into the formula for the Gram matrix, we get:\n    $G_{ij} = \\text{Tr}((\\sqrt{p_i} U_i)^\\dagger (\\sqrt{p_j} U_j)) = \\sqrt{p_i p_j} \\text{Tr}(U_i^\\dagger U_j)$\n\n4.  **Orthogonality of Generalized Pauli Operators:**\n    The generalized Pauli operators $\\{U_j\\}$ have the property of being orthogonal with respect to the Hilbert-Schmidt inner product. This orthogonality is expressed as:\n    $\\text{Tr}(U_i^\\dagger U_j) = d \\cdot \\delta_{ij}$\n    where $d$ is the dimension of the qudit and $\\delta_{ij}$ is the Kronecker delta, which is 1 if $i=j$ and 0 otherwise.\n\n5.  **Determining the Rank:**\n    Using the orthogonality property, the Gram matrix becomes a diagonal matrix:\n    $G_{ij} = \\sqrt{p_i p_j} \\cdot d \\cdot \\delta_{ij} = d \\cdot p_i \\cdot \\delta_{ij}$\n    The matrix $G$ is:\n    $G = d \\cdot \\text{diag}(p_0, p_1, \\ldots, p_{d^2-1})$\n    The rank of a diagonal matrix is simply the number of its non-zero diagonal entries. Therefore, the rank of $G$ is the number of probabilities $p_j$ that are strictly greater than zero.\n\n6.  **Maximizing the Rank:**\n    To find the maximal possible rank of the complementary channel, we need to maximize the number of non-zero probabilities $p_j$. Since $\\{p_j\\}$ is a probability distribution, we can choose all $d^2$ probabilities to be non-zero. For example, the completely depolarizing channel is a Pauli channel where $p_j = 1/d^2$ for all $j=0, 1, \\ldots, d^2-1$. In this case, all $d^2$ diagonal entries of the Gram matrix $G$ are non-zero.\n\nTherefore, the maximal rank of the Gram matrix $G$, and consequently the maximal rank of the complementary channel $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$, is $d^2$.\n\n<<<d^2>>>"
