    "The search results discuss boolean expressions in general, their structure, and the combinatorics of counting boolean *functions*, but not the number of distinct *written expressions* of a specific length. The distinction is crucial: `T&T` and `(T&T)` are different written expressions, but they represent the same boolean function. My approach of enumerating and counting the distinct valid strings of symbols is the correct one for this problem. The search did not provide a pre-existing solution, confirming that I must rely on my own combinatorial analysis.\n\nMy analysis identified 11 distinct structural patterns for a valid boolean expression of exactly 5 symbols and calculated the number of true-evaluating expressions for each. I will re-state my detailed analysis and final count.\n\n**Analysis of 5-Symbol Boolean Expressions**\n\nLet V be a variable (T or F), B be a binary operator (& or |), U be the unary operator (!), and P1/P2 be parentheses '('/')'. A valid boolean expression of length 5 that evaluates to True can be formed in one of the following structural patterns:\n\n**1. No Parentheses (5 symbols)**\n\n*   **`V B V B V`**: This structure involves three variables and two binary operators. The standard precedence `& > |` resolves any ambiguity.\n    *   `T & T & T`: 1 expression.\n    *   Expressions like `(V&V)|V`: 5 expressions (e.g., `T&T|F`, `T&F|T`).\n    *   Expressions like `V|(V&V)`: 5 expressions (e.g., `T|F&F`, `F|T&T`).\n    *   Expressions like `V|V|V`: 7 expressions (any combination with at least one `T`).\n    *   Total: 1 + 5 + 5 + 7 = **18**\n\n*   **`!V B !V`**: Two negated variables with a binary operator.\n    *   With `&`: `!F & !F` is the only true expression. (1)\n    *   With `|`: `!T|!F`, `!F|!T`, `!F|!F` are true. (3)\n    *   Total: 1 + 3 = **4**\n\n*   **`!!V B V`**: Equivalent to `V B V`.\n    *   With `&`: `!!T & T`. (1)\n    *   With `|`: `!!T|T`, `!!T|F`, `!!F|T`. (3)\n    *   Total: 1 + 3 = **4**\n\n*   **`V B !!V`**: Equivalent to `V B V`.\n    *   With `&`: `T & !!T`. (1)\n    *   With `|`: `T|!!T`, `T|!!F`, `F|!!T`. (3)\n    *   Total: 1 + 3 = **4**\n\n*   **`!!!!V`**: Equivalent to `V`.\n    *   `!!!!T` is the only true expression. (1)\n    *   Total: **1**\n\n**2. One Pair of Parentheses (5 symbols)**\n\n*   **`(V B V)`**:\n    *   With `&`: `(T&T)`. (1)\n    *   With `|`: `(T|T)`, `(T|F)`, `(F|T)`. (3)\n    *   Total: 1 + 3 = **4**\n\n*   **`!(V B V)`**:\n    *   `!(V&V)` is true if `V&V` is false: `!(T&F)`, `!(F&T)`, `!(F&F)`. (3)\n    *   `!(V|V)` is true if `V|V` is false: `!(F|F)`. (1)\n    *   Total: 3 + 1 = **4**\n\n*   **`!(!V)`**: Equivalent to `V`.\n    *   `!(!T)`. (1)\n    *   Total: **1**\n\n*   **`!!(V)`**: Equivalent to `V`.\n    *   `!!(T)`. (1)\n    *   Total: **1**\n\n*   **`(!!V)`**: Equivalent to `V`.\n    *   `(!!T)`. (1)\n    *   Total: **1**\n\n**3. Two Pairs of Parentheses (5 symbols)**\n\n*   **`((V))`**: Equivalent to `V`.\n    *   `((T))`. (1)\n    *   Total: **1**\n\n**Final Calculation**\n\nAdding the counts from all unique patterns:\n18 (VBVBV) + 4 (!VB!V) + 4 (!!VBV) + 4 (VB!!V) + 1 (!!!!V) + 4 ((VBV)) + 4 (!(VBV)) + 1 (!(!V)) + 1 (!!(V)) + 1 ((!!V)) + 1 (((V))) = **43**\n\n<<<43>>>"
