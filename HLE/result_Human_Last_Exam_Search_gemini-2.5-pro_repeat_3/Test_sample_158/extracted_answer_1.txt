Based on the principles of magnetostatics, a non-trivial solution for the required permeability does not exist. The mathematical formulation of the problem, which requires satisfying the electromagnetic boundary conditions at both the inner (R₁) and outer (R₂) surfaces of the shell while keeping the external field undistorted, leads to a contradiction unless the shell has zero thickness (R₁ = R₂) or its permeability is the same as the surrounding space (μ = μ₀). Both of these are trivial cases, and the latter is explicitly excluded by the problem statement.

Consequently, since no such permeability exists, the magnetic field in the interior region, H_int, cannot be determined for a non-trivial configuration.
