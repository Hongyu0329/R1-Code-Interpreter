    "The Christian theologian who first developed specialized terminology to describe changes in the laws of nature, applicable to both the virgin birth of Jesus and the possible alterations in natural laws at the Fall, was **Augustine of Hippo**.\n\nAugustine developed the concept of \"**seminal reasons**\" (in Latin, *rationes seminales*). This philosophical and theological framework posits that God embedded \"hidden causes\" or potentialities within creation from the very beginning. From this perspective, events that appear to be changes or violations of natural law are not contrary to nature itself, but only contrary to our limited understanding of it.\n\nThis terminology can be applied to both theological concepts mentioned in the question:\n*   **The Virgin Birth**: Augustine argued that the virgin birth of Jesus was a \"notable miracle\" and a unique event necessary for Christ to be born without the stain of original sin, which he taught was transmitted through the normal process of human procreation. The virgin birth can be understood as the activation of a special \"seminal reason\" placed within nature by God, allowing for a unique mode of human conception that was otherwise dormant.\n*   **The Fall**: Augustine taught that when Adam sinned, the \"seminal nature\" of all humanity, which was present in Adam, was \"vitiated\" or corrupted. This alteration of human nature led to consequences like disordered desires (concupiscence) and death, which then became a \"natural consequence\" for all of Adam's descendants. This represents a change in the state of nature, explained through the corruption of its seminal principles.\n\nTherefore, Augustine's doctrine of seminal reasons provided a sophisticated theological language to explain how extraordinary events like the virgin birth and fundamental shifts in nature due to the Fall could occur within a world governed by God's providential order, without viewing them as arbitrary violations of that order.\n\n<<<Augustine of Hippo>>>"
