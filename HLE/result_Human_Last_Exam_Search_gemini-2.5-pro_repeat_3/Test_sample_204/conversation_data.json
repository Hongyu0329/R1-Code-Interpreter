    "The Hopf charge, also known as the Hopf invariant, is a topological invariant that classifies maps from the 3-sphere (S³) to the 2-sphere (S²). The given vector field `n=(nx,ny,nz)` is a unit vector field defined in 3D space (ℝ³). By considering that the field approaches a constant value at infinity, the space ℝ³ can be compactified to S³, making the vector field a map `n: S³ → S²`.\n\nThe Hopf charge can be determined using the Whitehead integral formula, but a more intuitive and equivalent method is to calculate the linking number of the preimages of two distinct points on the target sphere S².\n\n**1. Identifying the Preimages:**\n\nLet's find the preimages of the south and north poles of the sphere S².\n\n*   **Preimage of the South Pole (-1, 0, 0):**\n    The south pole corresponds to `n = (0, 0, -1)`. This occurs when the polar angle `G` is equal to π.\n    From the definition `G = π * exp(-10*r2)`, we set `G = π`:\n    `π = π * exp(-10*r2)`\n    `1 = exp(-10*r2)`\n    This implies `r2 = 0`.\n    The variable `r2` is defined as `r2 = sqrt((x*x+y*y-0.5)² + z*z)`. For `r2` to be zero, both terms under the square root must be zero:\n    *   `z = 0`\n    *   `x² + y² - 0.5 = 0`  => `x² + y² = 0.5`\n    This describes a circle in the xy-plane with a radius of `sqrt(0.5)`, centered at the origin. This circle is the preimage of the south pole.\n\n*   **Preimage of the North Pole (1, 0, 0):**\n    The north pole corresponds to `n = (0, 0, 1)`. This occurs when the polar angle `G` is equal to 0.\n    `0 = π * exp(-10*r2)`\n    This is only true in the limit where `r2 → ∞`. This means the preimage of the north pole is the \"point at infinity\".\n\nFor a field configuration like the one given, which has a singularity along the z-axis (since the azimuthal angle `f = atan2(y,x)` is ill-defined for x=0 and y=0), the z-axis itself acts as a preimage line singularity. In a physically regularized version of this field, the z-axis would map to the north pole.\n\n**2. Calculating the Linking Number:**\n\nThe Hopf charge is the linking number of the preimages of these two poles. We have:\n*   A circle of radius `sqrt(0.5)` in the xy-plane.\n*   The z-axis.\n\nThe z-axis passes directly through the center of the circle in the xy-plane. A line passing through a circle has a linking number of 1. Therefore, the Hopf charge of this field is 1.\n\nThis result is consistent with analyses of similar topological structures, often called \"torons\" or \"hopfions,\" where the Hopf charge is found by multiplying the winding numbers in the azimuthal (`f`) and poloidal (`G`) directions. In this case, both winding numbers are 1, giving a total Hopf charge of 1 * 1 = 1.\n\n<<<1>>>"
