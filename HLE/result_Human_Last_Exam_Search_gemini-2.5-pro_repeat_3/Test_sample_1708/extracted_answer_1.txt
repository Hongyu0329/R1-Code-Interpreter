The order type of the set of finite strings of characters {a,b,c,d} ordered lexically is that of a countable, totally ordered set with a least element and no greatest element. It is not a well-ordering (and thus not an ordinal number) because it contains infinite descending chains. Furthermore, the ordering is not dense, as there are elements that have immediate successors. This specific order type does not have a common standard name like ω or η, but can be precisely described by the properties of the set.
