    "Based on my research, the premise of your question is incorrect. Goodluck Ebele Jonathan's full name does not include \"Azikiwe,\" and he has never publicly identified himself as such. You might be confusing him with Nnamdi Azikiwe, who was the first President of Nigeria.\n\nSince the event you're asking about never happened, there is no year to provide. I will provide a Python script to clarify this.\n\n```python\ndef clarify_name():\n    \"\"\"\n    Addresses the user's question about when Goodluck Jonathan identified as Azikiwe.\n    \"\"\"\n    person_in_question = \"Goodluck Ebele Jonathan\"\n    confused_name = \"Nnamdi Azikiwe\"\n    \n    print(f\"The user's question is based on a misunderstanding.\")\n    print(f\"The full name of the former Nigerian President is {person_in_question}.\")\n    print(f\"He has never publicly identified himself with the name 'Azikiwe'.\")\n    print(f\"This is likely a confusion with {confused_name}, the first President of Nigeria.\")\n    print(f\"Therefore, there is no year in which this event occurred because it never happened.\")\n\nclarify_name()\n```\n<<<This event never occurred. Goodluck Ebele Jonathan has never publicly identified himself as Azikiwe.>>>"
