    "To solve for the common eigenvalues of the total angular momentum operators $J^2$ and $J_z$ for a p-electron, we first need to determine the relevant quantum numbers.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify Quantum Numbers**: For a p-electron, the orbital angular momentum quantum number is $l=1$, and the spin quantum number is $s=1/2$.\n2.  **Determine Total Angular Momentum (j)**: The total angular momentum quantum number, $j$, is obtained by coupling $l$ and $s$. The possible values of $j$ range from $|l-s|$ to $l+s$ in integer steps.\n    *   $j_{min} = |1 - 1/2| = 1/2$\n    *   $j_{max} = 1 + 1/2 = 3/2$\n    *   Thus, the possible values for $j$ are $1/2$ and $3/2$.\n3.  **Determine Magnetic Quantum Number (m_j)**: For each value of $j$, the magnetic quantum number, $m_j$, can take values from $-j$ to $+j$ in integer steps.\n4.  **Calculate Eigenvalues**:\n    *   The eigenvalues of the $J^2$ operator are given by the formula $\\hbar^2 j(j+1)$.\n    *   The eigenvalues of the $J_z$ operator are given by the formula $\\hbar m_j$.\n5.  **Implement in Python**: Write a script that iterates through each possible value of $j$ and its corresponding $m_j$ values. For each pair $(j, m_j)$, it will calculate and print the eigenvalues for $J^2$ and $J_z$. For simplicity, we will express the eigenvalues in units of $\\hbar$ and $\\hbar^2$.\n\nThe following Python code will execute this plan and print the results.\n\n```python\ndef solve_spin_orbital_coupling():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the common eigenvalues of J^2 and J_z for a p-electron.\n    \"\"\"\n    # For a p-electron, orbital angular momentum quantum number l=1\n    l = 1\n    # For an electron, spin quantum number s=1/2\n    s = 0.5\n\n    print(f\"Solving for a p-electron with l={l} and s={s}\\n\")\n\n    # The total angular momentum quantum number j can take values from |l-s| to l+s\n    j_values = [abs(l - s), l + s]\n\n    # Iterate through each possible j value\n    for j in j_values:\n        print(f\"--- For states with total angular momentum j = {j} ---\")\n        \n        # The eigenvalue of J^2 depends only on j\n        j2_eigenvalue = j * (j + 1)\n        print(f\"The eigenvalue of J^2 is j(j+1)ħ^2 = {j} * ({j} + 1)ħ^2 = {j2_eigenvalue}ħ^2\")\n        \n        # The magnetic quantum number m_j ranges from -j to +j in integer steps\n        m_j = -j\n        while m_j <= j:\n            # The eigenvalue of J_z depends on m_j\n            jz_eigenvalue = m_j\n            print(f\"  For m_j = {m_j: >4.1f}, the eigenvalue of J_z is m_jħ = {jz_eigenvalue: >4.1f}ħ\")\n            m_j += 1\n        print(\"\")\n\nsolve_spin_orbital_coupling()\n<<<\n--- For states with total angular momentum j = 0.5 ---\nThe eigenvalue of J^2 is j(j+1)ħ^2 = 0.5 * (0.5 + 1)ħ^2 = 0.75ħ^2\n  For m_j = -0.5, the eigenvalue of J_z is m_jħ = -0.5ħ\n  For m_j =  0.5, the eigenvalue of J_z is m_jħ =  0.5ħ\n\n--- For states with total angular momentum j = 1.5 ---\nThe eigenvalue of J^2 is j(j+1)ħ^2 = 1.5 * (1.5 + 1)ħ^2 = 3.75ħ^2\n  For m_j = -1.5, the eigenvalue of J_z is m_jħ = -1.5ħ\n  For m_j = -0.5, the eigenvalue of J_z is m_jħ = -0.5ħ\n  For m_j =  0.5, the eigenvalue of J_z is m_jħ =  0.5ħ\n  For m_j =  1.5, the eigenvalue of J_z is m_jħ =  1.5ħ\n>>>"
