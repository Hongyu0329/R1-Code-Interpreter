    "This is a classic Chinese character riddle that plays on the visual components of the character. Let's break it down step by step.\n\n1.  **\"A wooden stick\"**: This refers to the character for wood or tree, which is **木** (mù).\n2.  **\"a square box\"**: This refers to the character for mouth or an enclosure, which is **口** (kǒu).\n3.  **\"a ladder placed in the center\"**: A square box with a \"ladder\" (represented by a cross) in the center forms the character for a field, **田** (tián).\n4.  **Putting it together**: The riddle describes combining these parts. If you place the \"box with a ladder\" (**田**) on top of the \"wooden stick\" (**木**), you form the character **果** (guǒ).\n\nThe following Python code will print this logic.\n\n```python\ndef solve_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the Chinese character riddle by breaking it down\n    into its visual components and printing the logic.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Analyzing the riddle: 'A wooden stick, hanging a square box, a ladder placed in the center.'\")\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n\n    # Part 1: The wooden stick\n    part1_char = \"木\"\n    part1_desc = \"A wooden stick\"\n    print(f\"The phrase '{part1_desc}' refers to the character for wood/tree: {part1_char}\")\n\n    # Part 2: The box with a ladder\n    part2_char = \"田\"\n    part2_desc = \"a square box, a ladder placed in the center\"\n    print(f\"The phrase '{part2_desc}' describes the character for field: {part2_char}\")\n    print(\"  - The 'square box' is the outer frame of 田.\")\n    print(\"  - The 'ladder' is the cross '+' inside the box.\")\n\n    # Part 3: Combining the parts\n    final_char = \"果\"\n    print(\"\\nCombining these components by placing the 'box with a ladder' (田) on top of the 'wooden stick' (木) gives us the final character.\")\n    \n    # Final Equation\n    print(f\"\\nFinal Equation: {part1_char} + {part2_char} = {final_char}\")\n    print(f\"\\nThe character is {final_char} (guǒ), which means 'fruit'.\")\n\nsolve_riddle()\n```\n<<<果>>>"
