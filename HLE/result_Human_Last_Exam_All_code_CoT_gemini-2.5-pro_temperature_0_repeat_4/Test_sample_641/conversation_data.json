    "To find the number of involutions in the projective special unitary group PSU(4, 997), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the Group and its Properties**: The group is PSU(n, q) with n=4 and q=997. An involution is an element *g* such that *g*² is the identity and *g* is not the identity.\n\n2.  **Relate Involutions in PSU(n,q) to elements in SU(n,q)**: PSU(n,q) is the quotient group SU(n,q) / Z(SU(n,q)), where Z is the center. An element *gZ* in PSU is an involution if (*gZ*)² = Z, which means *g*² must be in the center Z.\n    *   For SU(4, 997), the center Z has order gcd(4, 997+1) = gcd(4, 998) = 2. The center is Z = {I, -I}, where I is the 4x4 identity matrix.\n    *   So, we need to find elements *g* in SU(4, 997) such that *g*² = I or *g*² = -I.\n\n3.  **Analyze the case *g*² = -I**: An element *g* in a unitary group U(n,q) must have eigenvalues λ that satisfy λ^(q+1) = 1. If *g*² = -I, its eigenvalues must also satisfy λ² = -1.\n    *   From λ² = -1, we have λ⁴ = 1.\n    *   We need both λ^(q+1) = 1 and λ⁴ = 1 to hold. This implies λ^gcd(q+1, 4) = 1.\n    *   For q=997, q+1=998. We need λ^gcd(998, 4) = λ² = 1.\n    *   This contradicts λ² = -1 (since q is odd, 1 ≠ -1).\n    *   Therefore, there are no elements *g* in SU(4, 997) such that *g*² = -I.\n\n4.  **Analyze the case *g*² = I**: These are the true involutions in SU(4, 997).\n    *   An involution in SU(n,q) must have determinant 1. Since the eigenvalues are ±1, the dimension of the (-1)-eigenspace, let's call it *s*, must be even.\n    *   For n=4, possible values for *s* are 2 and 4.\n    *   If *s*=4, the element is -I. This is the central involution. Its image in PSU(4, 997) is the identity element, so we do not count it.\n    *   If *s*=2, these are the non-central involutions. They all belong to a single conjugacy class in SU(4, 997). Let's call this set of involutions *X*.\n\n5.  **Count the number of these involutions**: The number of such involutions, |*X*|, can be calculated using the formula for the size of a conjugacy class in the unitary group U(4,q).\n    *   The number of involutions with a (-1)-eigenspace of dimension 2 in U(4,q) is given by |U(4,q)| / (|U(2,q)| * |U(2,q)|).\n    *   Using the order formulas for unitary groups, this simplifies to:\n        |*X*| = q⁴(q²+1)(q²-q+1)\n\n6.  **Count the involutions in PSU(4, 997)**: The set of involutions in PSU(4, 997) is the image of the set *X* under the projection map from SU to PSU.\n    *   This map sends an element *g* to the coset *gZ*.\n    *   For any involution *g* in *X*, the element *g*(-I) is also an involution in *X*, and *g* ≠ *g*(-I).\n    *   The map is 2-to-1, meaning each involution in PSU(4, 997) corresponds to a pair of involutions {*g*, *g*(-I)} in SU(4, 997).\n    *   Therefore, the total number of involutions in PSU(4, 997) is |*X*| / 2.\n\n7.  **Final Formula**: The number of involutions is (1/2) * q⁴(q²+1)(q²-q+1).\n\nThe following Python code calculates this value for q=997 and prints the final equation and result.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of involutions in PSU(4, 997).\n    \"\"\"\n    q = 997\n\n    # The number of involutions in PSU(4, q) for q=1 (mod 4) is\n    # (1/2) * q^4 * (q^2 + 1) * (q^2 - q + 1)\n\n    q_2 = q * q\n    q_4 = q_2 * q_2\n\n    term1 = q_2 + 1\n    term2 = q_2 - q + 1\n\n    # Use integer division\n    result = (q_4 * term1 * term2) // 2\n\n    print(f\"The number of involutions is given by the formula:\")\n    print(f\"(q^4 * (q^2 + 1) * (q^2 - q + 1)) / 2\")\n    print(f\"Substituting q = {q}:\")\n    print(f\"({q_4} * {term1} * {term2}) // 2 = {result}\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<4860993104999411055>>>"
