    "To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum number of non-top-facing stickers that must be seen to distinguish between all 21 possible Permutations of the Last Layer (PLLs). The key is to find the \"worst-case scenario\": two different PLL cases that look the most similar from a certain angle. The number of stickers required to tell these two specific cases apart will be the minimum number required for all cases.\n\nOur plan is as follows:\n1.  We will analyze two PLL cases that are known to be difficult to distinguish: the **Ua-perm** and the **Z-perm**.\n2.  We will examine the three non-top-facing stickers on the front face of the cube for each case, assuming a standard color scheme (Front=Green, Right=Red, Back=Blue, Left=Orange).\n3.  We will show that for a specific orientation, these three stickers can be identical for both the Ua-perm and the Z-perm. This proves that seeing only three stickers is insufficient.\n4.  We will then examine a fourth sticker—the sticker on the right-side edge—to show that it resolves the ambiguity.\n5.  This will demonstrate that a minimum of four stickers is necessary to guarantee the identification of any PLL case.\n\n```python\ndef solve_pll_sticker_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the minimum number of non-top-facing stickers\n    needed to identify any PLL case on a 3x3 Rubik's Cube.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    print(\"Analyzing the worst-case scenario to determine the minimum number of stickers.\")\n    print(\"The chosen cases are the Ua-perm and the Z-perm.\")\n    print(\"Standard color scheme: Front=Green, Right=Red, Back=Blue, Left=Orange.\\n\")\n\n    # --- Step 1: Analyze the 3 stickers on the Front Face ---\n    \n    # For a Ua-perm with the solved block at the back, the front corners are solved,\n    # but the front edge is part of a 3-cycle.
