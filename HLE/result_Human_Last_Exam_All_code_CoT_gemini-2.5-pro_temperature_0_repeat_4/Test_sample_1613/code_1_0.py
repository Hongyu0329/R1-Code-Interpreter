def calculate_max_children():

    Calculates the maximum possible number of children based on the geometric constraints.

    The number of children corresponds to the number of ordered pairs of trees (X, Y)
    from the set {A, B, C, D} that can simultaneously block the view to trees E and F.
    This is possible if and only if the line segment XY intersects the line segment EF.

    To maximize this, we partition the four trees {A, B, C, D} by the line passing
    through E and F. Let k be the number of trees on one side. The number of pairs
    of trees on opposite sides is 2 * k * (4-k). We want to maximize this value.
