    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Analyze the function `f(a, b, c)`:** The recursive definition `f(a,b,c) = f(a-1,b,c) + f(a,b-2,c) + f(a,b,c-3)` with `f(0,0,0)=1` implies that `f(a,b,c)` counts the number of ways to form `(a,b,c)` using steps `(1,0,0)`, `(0,2,0)`, and `(0,0,3)`. This is non-zero only if `b` is an even integer and `c` is a multiple of 3. In that case, `f(a,b,c)` is given by the multinomial coefficient:\n    `f(a, b, c) = (a + b/2 + c/3)! / (a! * (b/2)! * (c/3)!)`\n\n2.  **Use Modular Arithmetic Properties:** We need to compute `f(\\alpha_p, \\beta_p, \\gamma_p) \\pmod p`. A key property for this type of recurrence, related to Lucas's Theorem, is that the function value for large arguments can be broken down based on their base-`p` digits:\n    `f(a, b, c) \\equiv \\prod_{i=0}^{k} f(a_i, b_i, c_i) \\pmod p`\n    where `a = \\sum a_i p^i`, `b = \\sum b_i p^i`, and `c = \\sum c_i p^i` are the base-`p` expansions. This requires that for each digit `i`, `b_i` is even and `c_i` is a multiple of 3.\n\n3.  **Determine the Base-`p` Digits:** We need to find the base-`p` digits of `\\alpha_p`, `\\beta_p`, and `\\gamma_p`.\n    Let's analyze `\\alpha_p`:\n    `\\alpha_p = \\sum_{i=0}^{\\frac{3p-1}{2}}{(p^{3i}+3p^{3i+1}+4p^{3i+2}})`\n    This is a polynomial in `p`. Since `p = 2^{127}-1` is very large, the coefficients `1, 3, 4` are less than `p`. This expression is effectively the base-`p` expansion of `\\alpha_p`. The digits `(\\alpha_p)_k` are a repeating sequence: `(1, 3, 4, 1, 3, 4, ...)`.\n    Similarly, for `\\beta_p`, the digits are `(8, 4, 4, 8, 4, 4, ...)`. All these digits are even.\n    For `\\gamma_p`, the digits are `(3, 9, 12, 3, 9, 12, ...)`. All these digits are multiples of 3.\n    The conditions for the product formula are met.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Product:** The product of `f` values will be a power of the product of the `f` values for one repeating block of digits.\n    Let `F_0 = f(1, 8, 3)`, `F_1 = f(3, 4, 9)`, and `F_2 = f(4, 4, 12)`.\n    The total result is `(F_0 \\cdot F_1 \\cdot F_2)^E \\pmod p`, where `E` is the number of repeating blocks.\n    The summation runs from `i=0` to `(3p-1)/2`, which means there are `(3p-1)/2 + 1 = (3p+1)/2` terms in the sum, and thus `(3p+1)/2` blocks of digits. So, `E = (3p+1)/2`.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Power Modulo `p`:** Let `K = F_0 \\cdot F_1 \\cdot F_2`. We need to compute `K^{(3p+1)/2} \\pmod p`.\n    Using Fermat's Little Theorem (`a^{p-1} \\equiv 1 \\pmod p`):\n    `K^{(3p+1)/2} = K^{3(p-1)/2 + 2} = (K^{(p-1)/2})^3 \\cdot K^2 \\pmod p`.\n    `K^{(p-1)/2}` is the Legendre symbol `(K/p)`. So the expression is `(K/p)^3 \\cdot K^2 = (K/p) \\cdot K^2 \\pmod p`.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Legendre Symbol `(K/p)`:**\n    *   `K = f(1,8,3) \\cdot f(3,4,9) \\cdot f(4,4,12) = 30 \\cdot 560 \\cdot 3150 = 52,920,000`.\n    *   The prime factorization of `K` is `2^6 \\cdot 3^3 \\cdot 5^4 \\cdot 7^2`.\n    *   `(K/p) = (2^6/p)(3^3/p)(5^4/p)(7^2/p)`. The terms with even powers are 1.\n    *   `(K/p) = (3^3/p) = (3/p)`.\n    *   Using the law of quadratic reciprocity: `(3/p) = (p/3)(-1)^{((p-1)/2)((3-1)/2)} = (p/3)(-1)^{(p-1)/2}`.\n    *   `p = 2^{127}-1 \\equiv (-1)^{127}-1 = -2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3`. So `(p/3)=1`.\n    *   `p = 2^{127}-1 \\equiv -1 \\equiv 3 \\pmod 4`. So `(p-1)/2` is odd, and `(-1)^{(p-1)/2}=-1`.\n    *   Therefore, `(K/p) = (3/p) = 1 \\cdot (-1) = -1`.\n\n7.  **Final Calculation:** The result is `(-1) \\cdot K^2 \\pmod p`, which is `p - K^2`. The following Python code will compute this value.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef multinomial(n, *k):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the multinomial coefficient C(n, k1, k2, ...)\"\"\"\n    if sum(k) != n:\n        return 0\n    res = math.factorial(n)\n    for val in k:\n        res //= math.factorial(val)\n    return res\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the f values for the repeating block of digits.\n# Digits for (alpha_p, beta_p, gamma_p) repeat as (1,8,3), (3,4,9), (4,4,12)\n\n# F_0 = f(1, 8, 3)\na0, b0, c0 = 1, 8, 3\nf0 = multinomial(a0 + b0//2 + c0//3, a0, b0//2, c0//3)\n\n# F_1 = f(3, 4, 9)\na1, b1, c1 = 3, 4, 9\nf1 = multinomial(a1 + b1//2 + c1//3, a1, b1//2, c1//3)\n\n# F_2 = f(4, 4, 12)\na2, b2, c2 = 4, 4, 12\nf2 = multinomial(a2 + b2//2 + c2//3, a2, b2//2, c2//3)\n\nprint(f\"f(1, 8, 3) = C(1+4+1, 1, 4, 1) = {f0}\")\nprint(f\"f(3, 4, 9) = C(3+2+3, 3, 2, 3) = {f1}\")\nprint(f\"f(4, 4, 12) = C(4+2+4, 4, 2, 4) = {f2}\")\n\n# Step 2: Calculate K, the product of the f values.\nK = f0 * f1 * f2\nprint(f\"K = {f0} * {f1} * {f2} = {K}\")\n\n# Step 3: Calculate K^2.\nK_squared = K**2\nprint(f\"K^2 = {K_squared}\")\n\n# Step 4: Define the prime p.\np = 2**127 - 1\nprint(f\"p = 2^127 - 1 = {p}\")\n\n# Step 5: The final result is p - K^2.\n# As derived in the explanation, f(alpha_p, beta_p, gamma_p) mod p = -K^2 mod p\nresult = p - K_squared\nprint(f\"The final result is p - K^2 = {result}\")\n\n```\n<<<170141183460469231731687303715884105727>>>"
