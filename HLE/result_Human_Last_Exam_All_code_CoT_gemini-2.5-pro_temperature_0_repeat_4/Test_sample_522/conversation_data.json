    "My thinking process to solve this puzzle is as follows:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Input/Output Format:** The inputs and outputs are strings representing a grid of numbers. Each comma-separated part is a row in the grid.\n\n2.  **Deconstruct the Transformation:** I'll compare the input and output grids for the given examples (A and B) to find the rule.\n    *   **Example A:**\n        *   Input: `001111,121111,111111` (Grid: `[[0,0,1,1,1,1], [1,2,1,1,1,1], [1,1,1,1,1,1]]`)\n        *   Output: `201111,101111,111111` (Grid: `[[2,0,1,1,1,1], [1,0,1,1,1,1], [1,1,1,1,1,1]]`)\n        *   Changes: The `2` at `(row=1, col=1)` becomes a `0`. The `0` at `(0,0)` becomes a `2`.\n    *   **Example B:**\n        *   Input: `...1111000011110,1111002111111...`\n        *   Output: `...1111000211110,1111000111111...`\n        *   Changes: The `2` at `(3,6)` becomes a `0`. The `0` at `(2,7)` becomes a `2`.\n\n3.  **Formulate a Hypothesis:** The number `2` seems to \"jump\" to a nearby `0`, swapping places. The jump is always to a diagonal cell. Let's analyze the jump direction.\n    *   In A: `2` is at `(1,1)`. It jumps to `(0,0)`. The jump vector is `(-1, -1)`.\n    *   In B: `2` is at `(3,6)`. It jumps to `(2,7)`. The jump vector is `(-1, +1)`.\n\n4.  **Refine the Hypothesis:** The jump direction is not constant. It might depend on the coordinates of the `2`. Let's check the parity (even/odd) of the coordinates (using 0-based indexing).\n    *   In A: `(1,1)` -> `r=1` (odd), `c=1` (odd). Jump is `(-1, -1)`.\n    *   In B: `(3,6)` -> `r=3` (odd), `c=6` (even). Jump is `(-1, +1)`.\n    *   This suggests a pattern:\n        *   `r` odd, `c` odd -> jump `(-1, -1)` (up-left)\n        *   `r` odd, `c` even -> jump `(-1, +1)` (up-right)\n    *   I can extrapolate this to other parities:\n        *   `r` even, `c` odd -> jump `(+1, -1)` (down-left)\n        *   `r` even, `c` even -> jump `(+1, +1)` (down-right)\n    *   The jump only occurs if the target cell contains a `0`.\n\n5.  **Test the Hypothesis on the Target Case (Input_C):**\n    *   Input_C: `000000,011120,111111`\n    *   Grid: `[[0,0,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,1,2,0], [1,1,1,1,1,1]]`\n    *   The `2` is at `(r=1, c=4)`.\n    *   `r=1` is odd, `c=4` is even. The rule is `(r odd, c even) -> jump (-1, +1)`.\n    *   The target coordinates are `(1-1, 4+1) = (0, 5)`.\n    *   The value at `grid[0][5]` is `0`. The condition is met.\n    *   Therefore, the `2` at `(1,4)` becomes `0`, and the `0` at `(0,5)` becomes `2`.\n    *   New Grid: `[[0,0,0,0,0,2], [0,1,1,1,0,0], [1,1,1,1,1,1]]`\n    *   This translates to the string: `000002,011100,111111`.\n\n6.  **Construct the Code:** I will write a Python script to implement this logic. The script will parse the input string into a grid, apply the transformation rule, and then format the resulting grid back into a string for printing.\n\n```python\ndef solve_puzzle(input_str):\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the puzzle by transforming the grid based on the position of '2'.\n\n    The rule is:\n    1. A '2' at position (r, c) becomes '0'.\n    2. A '0' at a target diagonal position becomes '2'.\n    3. The direction of the diagonal jump depends on the parity of (r, c):\n       - (odd, odd):   up-left (-1, -1)\n       - (odd, even):  up-right (-1, +1)\n       - (even, odd):  down-left (+1, -1)\n       - (even, even): down-right (+1, +1)\n    4.
