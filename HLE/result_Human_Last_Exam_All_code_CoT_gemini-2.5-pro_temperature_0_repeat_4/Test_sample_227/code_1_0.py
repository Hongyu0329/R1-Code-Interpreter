    This function calculates the maximal distance the snail could have advanced.
    The logic is based on constructing an optimal arrangement of overlapping observers.

    1. Base Case: If observers do not overlap, e.g., [0,1], [1,2], ..., [6,7],
       the total distance is 7 meters.

    2. Overlapping Observers: To maximize the distance, we can overlap the
       1-minute observation intervals. Consider a 1.5-minute block of time, e.g., [0, 1.5].
       We can cover this with two observers, one watching [0, 1] and another
       watching [0.5, 1.5].
       - Let d(t) be the distance at time t. We set d(0) = 0.
       - Observer on [0, 1] means: d(1) - d(0) = 1  => d(1) = 1.
       - Observer on [0.5, 1.5] means: d(1.5) - d(0.5) = 1.
       - To maximize the distance, the snail should travel as fast as possible.
         Let's assume the snail covers 1 meter instantly at t=0.5.
         So, d(0.5) = 1. This is consistent with d(1)=1 as d(t) is non-decreasing.
       - From the second condition, d(1.5) = d(0.5) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2.
       - So, in a 1.5-minute interval, the snail can travel 2 meters.

    3. Chaining the Blocks: We can chain these 1.5-minute blocks.
       - [0, 1.5] min: distance = 2 m
       - [1.5, 3.0] min: distance = 2 m, total distance d(3) = 4 m
       - [3.0, 4.5] min: distance = 2 m, total distance d(4.5) = 6 m
       - [4.5, 6.0] min: distance = 2 m, total distance d(6) = 8 m

    4. Final Minute: The interval [0, 6.0] is covered. We are left with [6.0, 7.0].
       - We place a final observer on [6, 7].
       - This means d(7) - d(6) = 1.
       - Since d(6) = 8, we get d(7) = 8 + 1 = 9.

    This arrangement of observers covers the full 7 minutes and results in a
    total distance of 9 meters.
