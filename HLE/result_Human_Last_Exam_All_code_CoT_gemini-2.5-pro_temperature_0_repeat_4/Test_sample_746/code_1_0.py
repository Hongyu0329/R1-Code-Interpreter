    print("\nStep 1: Assume the set of dispersion points, D, has a cardinality of at least 2.")
    print("Let p1 and p2 be two distinct dispersion points in X.")
    print("-" * 30)

    print("\nStep 2: Use the properties of X to construct a contradiction.")
    print("Since X is a connected metric space with at least two points, it must be uncountable. We can therefore choose a point 'a' in X that is different from both p1 and p2.")
    
    print("\nSince p2 is a dispersion point, the space X \\ {p2} is totally disconnected.")
    print("The points 'a' and 'p1' are distinct points within this totally disconnected space.")
    print("Therefore, there exists a partition of X \\ {p2} into two disjoint non-empty sets, U and V, that are both open in X \\ {p2}, such that 'a' is in U and 'p1' is in V.")
    
    print("\nBecause X \\ {p2} is an open subset of X, the sets U and V are also open in X.")

    print("Consider the set C = U union {p2}. This set is the closure of U in X, i.e., C = cl(U).")
    print("We can prove that C is a connected set. If C were not connected, it could be written as a union of two non-empty disjoint closed sets. This would imply that X itself is not connected, which contradicts our initial condition.")
    print("So, C = U union {p2} is a connected subset of X.")
    print("-" * 30)

    print("\nStep 4: The Contradiction.")
    print("The connected set C contains the point 'a' (which is in U) and the point p2. Since a and p2 are distinct, C is not a single point.")
    print("The set C does not contain p1, because p1 is in V, and V is disjoint from both U and {p2}.")
    
    print("\nNow, let's use the fact that p1 is also a dispersion point. This means X \\ {p1} is totally disconnected.")

    print("\nStep 5: Conclusion of the Proof.")
    print("Our initial assumption that there are at least two dispersion points must be false.")
    print("Therefore, the number of dispersion points, |D|, must be less than 2. This means |D| can be 0 or 1.")
    print("-" * 30)

    print("\nStep 6: Existence of a Space with One Dispersion Point.")
    print("To show that the maximum is 1, we need an example. The Knaster-Kuratowski fan is a well-known example of a compact connected metric space that has exactly one dispersion point.")
