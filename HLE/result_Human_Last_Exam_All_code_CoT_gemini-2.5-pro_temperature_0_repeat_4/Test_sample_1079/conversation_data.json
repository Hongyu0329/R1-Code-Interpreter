    "This problem requires understanding the properties of Coxeter elements within a finite reflection group, specifically the group of type H3. Here is a step-by-step plan to solve it:\n\n1.  **Relate the problem to Coxeter elements:** A key theorem in the theory of reflection groups states that an element has a regular eigenvector (an eigenvector not lying on any of the reflection hyperplanes) if and only if it is a **Coxeter element**. Therefore, the problem is asking for the number of Coxeter elements that have an eigenvalue of order 10.\n\n2.  **Examine the eigenvalues of Coxeter elements:** For any finite Coxeter group, the eigenvalues of a Coxeter element are given by the formula `exp(2 * π * i * m_j / h)`, where `h` is the Coxeter number and `m_j = d_j - 1` are the exponents of the group (derived from the degrees `d_j` of the fundamental invariants).\n    *   For the group H3, the Coxeter number `h` is 10.\n    *   The degrees are `d_1=2`, `d_2=6`, `d_3=10`.\n    *   The exponents are `m_1=1`, `m_2=5`, `m_3=9`.\n    *   Thus, the eigenvalues of any Coxeter element in H3 are `exp(2πi/10)`, `exp(10πi/10) = -1`, and `exp(18πi/10)`.\n\n3.  **Check the eigenvalue order condition:** The orders of these eigenvalues are 10, 2, and 10, respectively. This shows that every Coxeter element in H3 has two eigenvalues of order 10.\n\n4.  **Confirm the eigenvector regularity:** Another theorem states that the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue `exp(2 * π * i * k / h)` is regular if and only if `gcd(k, h) = 1`.\n    *   For the eigenvalues with order 10, the `k` values are 1 and 9.\n    *   `gcd(1, 10) = 1` and `gcd(9, 10) = 1`.\n    *   This confirms that the eigenvectors corresponding to the eigenvalues of order 10 are indeed regular.\n\n5.  **Count the Coxeter elements:** Since every Coxeter element in H3 satisfies the given conditions, the problem reduces to finding the total number of Coxeter elements in H3. The number of Coxeter elements in a finite Coxeter group `W` is given by the formula `|W| / h`, where `|W|` is the order of the group.\n    *   For H3, the order `|W|` is 120.\n    *   The Coxeter number `h` is 10.\n\nThe following Python code performs the final calculation based on this plan.\n\n```python\ndef count_h3_elements():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of elements of the reflection group of type H3\n    that have a regular eigenvector with a corresponding eigenvalue of order 10.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Properties of the H3 reflection group\n    # The order of the group H3 is 120.\n    order_W = 120\n    # The Coxeter number for H3 is 10.\n    coxeter_number_h = 10\n\n    print(\"The problem is to find the number of elements in H3 that are Coxeter elements.\")\n    print(\"This is because only Coxeter elements have regular eigenvectors, and for H3,\")\n    print(\"their corresponding eigenvalues are guaranteed to have order 10.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe number of Coxeter elements is the order of the group divided by the Coxeter number.\")\n    \n    # Calculate the number of Coxeter elements\n    num_elements = order_W // coxeter_number_h\n    \n    print(\"\\nFinal Calculation:\")\n    # The final output must show the numbers in the equation.\n    print(f\"{order_W} / {coxeter_number_h} = {num_elements}\")\n\ncount_h3_elements()\n```\n<<<12>>>"
