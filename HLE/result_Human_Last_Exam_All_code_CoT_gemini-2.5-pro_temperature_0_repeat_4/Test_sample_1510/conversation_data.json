    "To find the number of wallpaper groups with a point group of order 2, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Understand the terms:**\n    *   **Wallpaper Groups:** These are the 17 possible two-dimensional symmetry groups that describe repeating patterns in a plane.\n    *   **Point Group:** For each wallpaper group, there is an associated point group, which describes the symmetries of the pattern around a single point (like rotations and reflections), ignoring translations.\n    *   **Order of a Group:** This is the number of symmetry operations in the group. A point group of order 2 has exactly two operations: the identity (doing nothing) and one other operation (either a 180-degree rotation or a reflection).\n\n2.  **Identify the Point Groups of Order 2:** The possible point groups in 2D crystallography with order 2 are:\n    *   Group '2' (also called C₂): Contains the identity and a 180-degree rotation.\n    *   Group 'm' (also called Cₛ): Contains the identity and a single reflection.\n\n3.  **Map Wallpaper Groups to their Point Group Orders:** We will list the 17 wallpaper groups and identify the order of their corresponding point groups.\n\n4.  **Count the Matches:** We will count how many wallpaper groups have a point group of order 2.\n\nI will use a Python script to perform this task. The script will store the data for all 17 wallpaper groups and their point group orders in a dictionary. It will then iterate through this data to find and count the ones with an order of 2, printing the names of the groups and the final calculation.\n\n```python\ndef count_wallpaper_groups():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script identifies and counts the wallpaper groups whose point group has an order of 2.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A dictionary mapping the 17 wallpaper groups (IUC notation) to the order of their point group.\n    wallpaper_group_data = {\n        # Group Name: Point Group Order\n        'p1': 1,\n        'p2': 2,\n        'pm': 2,\n        'pg': 2,\n        'cm': 2,\n        'pmm': 4,\n        'pmg': 4,\n        'pgg': 4,\n        'cmm': 4,\n        'p4': 4,\n        'p4m': 8,\n        'p4g': 8,\n        'p3': 3,\n        'p3m1': 6,\n        'p31m': 6,\n        'p6': 6,\n        'p6m': 12\n    }\n\n    # Find the groups with a point group of order 2\n    groups_with_order_2 = []\n    for group, order in wallpaper_group_data.items():\n        if order == 2:\n            groups_with_order_2.append(group)\n\n    # Print the names of the identified groups\n    print(f\"The wallpaper groups with a point group of order 2 are: {', '.join(groups_with_order_2)}\")\n\n    # Create and print the equation showing the count\n    count = len(groups_with_order_2)\n    equation_numbers = ['1'] * count\n    equation_str = \" + \".join(equation_numbers)\n    \n    print(f\"The calculation for the total count is: {equation_str} = {count}\")\n\n# Execute the function\ncount_wallpaper_groups()\n```\n<<<4>>>"
