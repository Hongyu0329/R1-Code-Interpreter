    "My plan is to first establish the context of the problem, which is the functional integral representation of the partition function for a neutral scalar field at finite temperature.\n1.  I will start with the standard Euclidean action $S_E$ for a free scalar field.\n2.  Then, I will rewrite this action in a quadratic form, $S_E = \\frac{1}{2}(\\phi, D_\\phi \\phi)$, by using integration by parts. This step is crucial as it naturally defines the operator $D_\\phi$ and the inner product structure.\n3.  From this form, the operator $D_\\phi$ is identified as the Euclidean Klein-Gordon operator, $(-\\partial^2 + m^2)$.\n4.  The inner product $(\\phi, D_\\phi)$ is then simply the integral $\\int d^4x \\, \\phi(x) (-\\partial^2 + m^2) \\phi(x)$.\n5.  Finally, the Python script will print this final expression in a clear, symbolic format, explicitly showing all the numerical constants involved in the equation as requested. It will also highlight the important relationship $(\\phi, D_\\phi) = 2S_E[\\phi]$.\n\n```python\n# This script provides the expression for the inner product (phi, D_phi).\n\n# Explanation\nprint(\"In the functional integral formalism for a neutral scalar field at finite temperature, the Euclidean action, S_E, is central.\")\nprint(\"The action for a free field phi with mass m is:\")\nprint(\"  S_E[phi] = Integral[d^4x] * [ (1/2)*(del_mu phi)^2 + (1/2)*m^2*phi^2 ]\")\nprint(\"\\nAfter integration by parts, this action can be written in a quadratic form:\")\nprint(\"  S_E[phi] = (1/2) * Integral[d^4x] * phi(x) * (-del^2 + m^2) * phi(x)\")\nprint(\"where del^2 is the Euclidean Laplacian operator.\")\nprint(\"\\nThis quadratic form is denoted as S_E = (1/2) * (phi, D_phi * phi), which defines the operator D_phi and the inner product.\")\nprint(\"The operator is D_phi = -del^2 + m^2.\")\nprint(\"The inner product is (f, g) = Integral[d^4x] f(x)*g(x).\")\nprint(\"\\nTherefore, the inner product (phi, D_phi) is given by the following equation:\")\n\n# Define the numerical components of the final equation\nintegration_dim = 4\nkinetic_coeff = -1\nop_exponent = 2\nmass_exponent = 2\n\n# Print the final equation, showing each numerical component\nprint(\"\\n--- Final Equation ---\")\nprint(\"(phi, D_phi) = Integral[d^\", integration_dim, \"x] * phi(x) * (\",\n      kinetic_coeff, \" * del^\", op_exponent, \" + m^\", mass_exponent,\n      \") * phi(x)\", sep='')\n\nprint(\"\\nNote that this expression is exactly twice the Euclidean action:\")\nprint(\"(phi, D_phi) = 2 * S_E[phi]\")\n```\n<<<Integral[d^4x] * phi(x) * (-del^2 + m^2) * phi(x)>>>"
