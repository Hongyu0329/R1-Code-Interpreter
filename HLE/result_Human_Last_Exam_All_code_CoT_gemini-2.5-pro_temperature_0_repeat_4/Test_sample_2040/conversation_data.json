    "This is a physics question rather than a coding task. To answer it, we need to analyze the physical properties of boron nanosheets, specifically their crystal symmetry, and understand the requirements for the optical phenomenon of spontaneous parametric downconversion (SPDC).\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Define Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion (SPDC) and identify the key material property required for it to occur. The key property is the lack of inversion symmetry, which allows for a non-zero second-order nonlinear susceptibility (χ⁽²⁾).\n2.  Examine the crystal structure of free-standing boron nanosheets (borophene). I will check if the common, stable phases of borophene possess inversion symmetry.\n3.  Based on the symmetry analysis, I will conclude whether SPDC is expected in this material under normal conditions.\n4.  I will also mention potential exceptions or alternative scenarios where a similar effect might be observed (e.g., through strain, defects, or higher-order processes).\n5.  Finally, as requested, I will present this explanation within a Python code block using a `print()` statement.\n\n```python\ndef explain_spdc_in_boron_nanosheets():\n    \"\"\"\n    Explains whether free-standing boron nanosheets are expected to exhibit\n    spontaneous parametric downconversion (SPDC).\n    \"\"\"\n    explanation = \"\"\"\nSpontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion (SPDC) is a second-order nonlinear optical process. A fundamental requirement for a material to exhibit second-order nonlinear effects is that its crystal structure must lack a center of inversion symmetry.\n\nBoron nanosheets, also known as borophene, are 2D materials that can exist in several different atomic structures, or phases. The most commonly studied and synthesized phases of borophene (such as the β₁₂ and χ₃ phases) are known to be centrosymmetric. This means they possess a center of inversion symmetry.\n\nIn any material with inversion symmetry, the second-order nonlinear susceptibility tensor, χ⁽²⁾, is identically zero. Since the strength of SPDC is dependent on this χ⁽²⁾ value, the process is considered forbidden in the bulk of such materials.\n\nTherefore, pristine, unstrained, free-standing boron nanosheets are generally not expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric downconversion.\n\nIt is worth noting a few caveats:\n1.  **Symmetry Breaking:** If the material's inversion symmetry were to be broken, SPDC could be enabled. This could potentially be achieved by applying mechanical strain, introducing defects, interacting with a substrate, or applying a strong external DC electric field.\n2.  **Higher-Order Processes:** While the second-order process (SPDC) is forbidden, centrosymmetric materials can still exhibit third-order nonlinear processes (governed by χ⁽³⁾). A process called Spontaneous Four-Wave Mixing (SFWM), for example, can also generate pairs of photons and occurs in centrosymmetric materials like silicon and graphene.\n\"\"\"\n    print(explanation)\n\nexplain_spdc_in_boron_nanosheets()\n```\n<<<No, because the common phases of free-standing boron nanosheets are centrosymmetric. This symmetry forbids second-order nonlinear optical processes like spontaneous parametric downconversion.>>>"
