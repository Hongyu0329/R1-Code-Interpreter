    # The problem is to find a container for N>=27 balls with surface area < 864 cm^2.
    # The 3x3x3 simple cubic packing is the known optimal packing for 27 spheres in a cube.
    # This packing requires a cube of side length 3 * diameter = 3 * 4 = 12 cm.
    # The volume required for this packing is 12*12*12 = 1728 cm^3.

    # For any container holding these 27 balls with this packing, it must have a volume of at least 1728 cm^3.
    # A cube is the shape with the minimum surface area for a given volume.
    # Any other rectangular box shape with the same volume of 1728 cm^3 will have a larger surface area.
    # For example, a 10x12x14.4 box has V=1728, but SA = 2*(10*12 + 12*14.4 + 14.4*10) = 873.6, which is > 864.

    # To reduce the surface area, we would need to pack the 27 balls into a smaller volume.
    # This requires a packing denser than simple cubic.
    # However, the constraint that ball centers must be on a 0.5 cm grid prevents the use of
    # ideal dense packings (like FCC), which involve irrational coordinates.
    # Attempts to create denser, staggered packings on the grid lead to larger, not smaller, bounding boxes.
    # For example, a staggered 3x3x3 packing requires a 14x14x10 box, with a surface area of 952 cm^2.

    # Since no packing of 27 balls seems to fit in a container with a smaller surface area under the given
    # constraints, the answer is 0.
