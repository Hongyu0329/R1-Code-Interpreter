    This function determines the smallest possible number of complements a topology can have.

    Based on the reasoning provided:
    1. We interpret the question as asking for the minimum non-zero number of complements.
    2. There exists a known construction of a topology on a set X (where |X| is the cardinality of the continuum)
       that has exactly one complement.
    3. An example is partitioning X into two sets E and O of the same cardinality, and defining the topology T as
       T = {A subset of X | E is a subset of A or A has an empty intersection with E}.
    4. This topology T has a unique complement S = {B subset of X | O is a subset of B or B has an empty intersection with O}.
    5. Since a topology with exactly one complement exists, the minimum possible number of complements (greater than zero) is 1.
