    "To find the greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of the two polynomial matrices P1 and P2, we can use a method analogous to the Euclidean algorithm.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Form an Augmented Matrix:** We'll start by creating a single matrix `M` by stacking `P1` on top of `P2`.\n    `M = [P1; P2]`\n2.  **Perform Elementary Row Operations:** We will apply elementary row operations to `M` to reduce it to a simpler form (specifically, a row-echelon form). The allowed operations are:\n    *   Swapping two rows.\n    *   Multiplying a row by a non-zero constant.\n    *   Adding a polynomial multiple of one row to another.\n3.  **Identify the GCRD:** The goal of the reduction is to introduce zero rows. The remaining non-zero rows at the end of this process will form the GCRD matrix.\n4.  **Implementation:** We will use Python with the `sympy` library to handle the symbolic polynomial calculations. The code will perform the row reduction step-by-step and print the final resulting GCRD matrix.\n\nHere is the Python code to carry out this plan:\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\ndef solve_gcrd():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the Greatest Common Right Divisor (GCRD)\n    of two polynomial matrices P1 and P2.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the symbolic variable 's'\n    s = sp.Symbol('s')\n\n    # Define the polynomial matrices P1 and P2\n    P1 = sp.Matrix([[s**2 + s, -s],\n                    [-s**2 - 1, s**2]])\n\n    P2 = sp.Matrix([[s, 0],\n                    [-s - 1, 1]])\n\n    # Step 1: Form the augmented matrix M by stacking P1 and P2\n    M = P1.col_join(P2)\n    print(\"Initial augmented matrix M = [P1; P2]:\")\n    sp.pprint(M)\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 2: Perform elementary row operations to reduce M.\n    # Let the rows be R0, R1, R2, R3.\n    \n    # Operation: R3 -> R3 + R2\n    # This creates a row with constant entries, which is an excellent pivot.\n    M[3, :] = M[3, :] + M[2, :]\n    print(\"After R3 -> R3 + R2:\")\n    sp.pprint(M)\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    \n    # Now, use the new R3 = [-1, 1] to eliminate the first column in other rows.\n    # Operation: R0 -> R0 + (s**2 + s) * R3\n    M[0, :] = M[0, :] + (s**2 + s) * M[3, :]\n    # Operation: R1 -> R1 - (s**2 + 1) * R3\n    M[1, :] = M[1, :] - (s**2 + 1) * M[3, :]\n    # Operation: R2 -> R2 + s * R3\n    M[2, :] = M[2, :] + s * M[3, :]\n    \n    print(\"After using R3 to eliminate other entries in the first column:\")\n    sp.pprint(M)\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # The matrix is now:\n    # [  0,   s**2]\n    # [  0,     -1]\n    # [  0,      s]\n    # [ -1,      1]\n    # Let's use R1 = [0, -1] as the pivot for the second column.\n    \n    # Operation: R0 -> R0 + s**2 * R1\n    M[0, :] = M[0, :] + (s**2) * M[1, :]\n    # Operation: R2 -> R2 + s * R1\n    M[2, :] = M[2, :] + s * M[1, :]\n    # Operation: R3 -> R3 + 1 * R1\n    M[3, :] = M[3, :] + M[1, :]\n\n    print(\"After using R1 to eliminate other entries in the second column:\")\n    sp.pprint(M)\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # The matrix is now:\n    # [  0, 0]\n    # [  0,-1]\n    # [  0, 0]\n    # [ -1, 0]\n    # The non-zero rows are [-1, 0] and [0, -1].\n    \n    # Step 3: Extract the non-zero rows to form the GCRD.\n    GCRD = sp.Matrix([M[3, :], M[1, :]])\n\n    print(\"The final non-zero rows form the GCRD matrix.\")\n    print(\"Greatest Common Right Divisor (GCRD):\")\n    \n    # Print the final matrix elements as requested\n    row1 = GCRD.row(0)\n    row2 = GCRD.row(1)\n    print(f\"[{int(row1[0])}, {int(row1[1])}]\")\n    print(f\"[{int(row2[0])}, {int(row2[1])}]\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve_gcrd()\n```\n<<<[[-1, 0], [0, -1]]>>>"
