The key to this question lies in the difference between "swing" and "non-swing" dances.

1.  The English Waltz, Viennese Waltz, Slow Foxtrot, and Quickstep are all swing dances. Their technique is built on generating momentum, body swing, and sway to create movement and rotation. In these dances, overturning a figure is an advanced application of this core technique. It uses more swing and momentum, but it doesn't violate the dance's principles.

2.  The European Tango is fundamentally different. It is a "non-swing" dance characterized by a staccato action, no rise and fall, and a complete lack of body swing. Turns are sharp and created by swiveling, not by continuous rotation.

3.  To "overturn" a reverse turn, a dancer must generate continuous rotational momentum, which is the definition of swing. Introducing swing into the Tango is a direct contradiction and disregard for its core technique.

Therefore, the European Tango is the dance in which it is impossible to overturn a reverse turn without disregarding the technique.
