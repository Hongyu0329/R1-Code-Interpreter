# The geometric analysis leads to a quadratic equation for the radius r:
# r^2 - 12r + 4 = 0.
# This equation has two possible solutions for r, let's call them r1 and r2.
# The problem asks for a single value for r^2, which is ambiguous.
# A standard interpretation for such problems is to find a symmetric combination
# of the solutions. We calculate the sum of the squares of the possible radii, r1^2 + r2^2.

# From Vieta's formulas for a quadratic equation ax^2 + bx + c = 0:
# sum of roots (r1 + r2) = -b/a
# product of roots (r1 * r2) = c/a

a = 1
b = -12
c = 4

# Sum of the possible radii
sum_of_radii = -b / a

# Product of the possible radii
product_of_radii = c / a

# The sum of the squares of the radii is (r1 + r2)^2 - 2*r1*r2
sum_of_squares_of_radii = sum_of_radii**2 - 2 * product_of_radii
