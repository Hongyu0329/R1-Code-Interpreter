    "To find a(10), the number of 10-step self-avoiding walks on a Manhattan (2D square) lattice, we can use a computational approach. A direct enumeration is feasible for a number of steps as small as 10.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Model the Walk:** A walk starts at an origin, say (0,0), on a 2D grid. At each step, the walk can move to one of the four adjacent grid points (North, South, East, or West).\n2.  **Self-Avoiding Constraint:** The key rule is that the walk cannot visit any point more than once. We can keep track of all visited points in a set for efficient checking.\n3.  **Recursive Backtracking Algorithm:** We can define a recursive function that explores all possible paths.\n    - The function takes the current path (the set of visited points) and the current position as input.\n    - It tries to extend the walk by one step in all four directions.\n    - If a potential next point is already in the path, that direction is invalid.\n    - If the move is valid, the function calls itself with the updated path and new position.\n    - The recursion stops when the walk reaches the desired length of 10 steps. When this happens, we have found one valid walk.\n4.  **Symmetry Optimization:** The grid is symmetrical. The number of walks starting with a step to the right is the same as starting with a step left, up, or down. Therefore, we can calculate the number of walks for just one starting direction (e.g., right) and multiply the result by 4 to get the total number of walks. This reduces the total computation by a factor of four.\n\nThis plan leads to a Python script that implements the recursive search to find the value of a(10).\n\n```python\ndef solve_saw_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates a(10), the number of 10-step self-avoiding walks on a Manhattan lattice.\n\n    A self-avoiding walk is a path on a lattice that does not visit the same point\n    more than once. This function uses a recursive backtracking algorithm to count\n    all such walks of a specified length.\n\n    To optimize, it uses the symmetry of the square lattice. The total number of\n    walks is 4 times the number of walks starting in a specific direction (e.g., East).\n    \"\"\"\n    n = 10\n\n    def count_walks_recursive(path, x, y, length):\n        \"\"\"\n        Recursively counts self-avoiding walks from a given state.\n\n        Args:\n            path: A set of (x, y) tuples representing visited points.\n            x, y: The current coordinates of the head of the walk.\n            length: The current number of steps taken.\n\n        Returns:\n            The number of valid n-step self-avoiding walks from the current state.\n        \"\"\"\n        # Base case: If the walk has reached the desired length, we found one valid walk.\n        if length == n:\n            return 1\n\n        count = 0\n        # Explore the four possible moves (North, South, East, West).\n        moves = [(x, y + 1), (x, y - 1), (x + 1, y), (x - 1, y)]\n\n        for next_x, next_y in moves:\n            # Check if the next point has already been visited.\n            if (next_x, next_y) not in path:\n                # If not, add the new point to the path and recurse.\n                path.add((next_x, next_y))\n                count += count_walks_recursive(path, next_x, next_y, length + 1)\n                # Backtrack: remove the point to allow exploration of other branches.\n                path.remove((next_x, next_y))\n        return count\n\n    # Start the walk at (0,0).\n    # To use symmetry, we fix the first step, for example, to (1,0).\n    # The path now contains two points, and the length of the walk is 1.\n    start_path = {(0, 0), (1, 0)}\n    \n    # We need to find the number of walks of length n-1 starting from (1,0),\n    # with (0,0) already visited.\n    count_one_direction = count_walks_recursive(start_path, 1, 0, 1)\n    \n    # The total number of walks is 4 times this count.\n    total_walks = 4 * count_one_direction\n\n    print(f\"For n = {n}:\")\n    print(f\"Number of walks starting in one fixed direction = {count_one_direction}\")\n    print(f\"a({n}) = 4 * {count_one_direction} = {total_walks}\")\n\nsolve_saw_problem()\n<<<44100>>>\n```"
