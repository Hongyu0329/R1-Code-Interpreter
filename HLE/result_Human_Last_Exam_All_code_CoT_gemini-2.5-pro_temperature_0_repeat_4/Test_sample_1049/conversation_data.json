    "To find a closed form for the sum $S_n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n}((2k+1)^5\\binom{2k}{k}\\binom{2n-2k}{n-k})$, we can use the method of generating functions.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the convolution:** The sum is a convolution of two sequences. Let $c_k = \\binom{2k}{k}$. The sum is $S_n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} a_k c_{n-k}$, where $a_k = (2k+1)^5 c_k$.\n2.  **Find the generating functions:** The generating function for the sequence $\\{S_n\\}$ is the product of the generating functions for $\\{a_k\\}$ and $\\{c_k\\}$.\n    *   The generating function for $c_k = \\binom{2k}{k}$ is well-known:\n        $C(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\binom{2k}{k} x^k = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-4x}}$.\n    *   The generating function for $a_k = (2k+1)^5 \\binom{2k}{k}$ can be obtained by applying a differential operator to $C(x)$. Let $D = x \\frac{d}{dx}$. Then the generating function for $\\{k^m c_k\\}$ is $D^m C(x)$. The generating function for $a_k$ is $A(x) = (2D+1)^5 C(x)$.\n3.  **Calculate the product:** We compute $A(x)$ and then the generating function for the sum, $G(x) = A(x)C(x)$.\n    *   Let $H_m(x) = (2D+1)^m C(x)$. We can compute this iteratively.\n    *   $H_0(x) = C(x) = (1-4x)^{-1/2}$\n    *   $H_1(x) = (2D+1)H_0(x) = (1-4x)^{-3/2}$\n    *   $H_2(x) = (2D+1)H_1(x) = \\frac{8x+1}{(1-4x)^{5/2}}$\n    *   ...and so on, until we find $H_5(x)$.\n    *   $A(x) = H_5(x) = \\frac{4096x^4 + 18752x^3 + 8256x^2 + 464x + 1}{(1-4x)^{11/2}}$.\n    *   Then, $G(x) = A(x)C(x) = \\frac{4096x^4 + 18752x^3 + 8256x^2 + 464x + 1}{(1-4x)^{6}}$.\n4.  **Extract the coefficient:** We find $S_n$, which is the coefficient of $x^n$ in $G(x)$, denoted as $[x^n]G(x)$.\n    *   Using the generalized binomial theorem, $[x^k](1-z)^{-m} = \\binom{k+m-1}{m-1} z^k$, we have $[x^k](1-4x)^{-6} = \\binom{k+5}{5} 4^k$.\n    *   $S_n = [x^n]G(x) = 4096 \\binom{n+1}{5}4^{n-4} + 18752 \\binom{n+2}{5}4^{n-3} + 8256 \\binom{n+3}{5}4^{n-2} + 464 \\binom{n+4}{5}4^{n-1} + \\binom{n+5}{5}4^n$.\n5.  **Simplify the expression:** The expression for $S_n$ is a polynomial in $n$ of degree 5, multiplied by $4^n$. We can simplify this expression to a more compact form.\n    *   After simplification, the polynomial can be expressed as:\n        $S_n = 4^n \\frac{(n+1)(314n^4 + 911n^3 + 869n^2 + 306n + 40)}{40}$.\n\nThe following Python code will print the derived closed-form formula.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function prints the closed form for the given sum.\n    The formula is derived using generating functions.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The closed form for the sum S_n = sum_{k=0 to n} (2k+1)^5 * C(2k,k) * C(2n-2k, n-k)\n    # is a polynomial in n of degree 5, multiplied by 4^n.\n    \n    # The formula is:\n    # S_n = 4^n * P(n)\n    # where P(n) is a polynomial in n.\n    \n    # The polynomial P(n) can be written as:\n    # P(n) = (n+1)/40 * (314*n^4 + 911*n^3 + 869*n^2 + 306*n + 40)\n    \n    print(\"The closed form for the sum is:\")\n    print(\"S_n = 4**n * ( (n+1) * (314*n**4 + 911*n**3 + 869*n**2 + 306*n + 40) / 40 )\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<$S_n = 4^n \\frac{(n+1)(314n^4 + 911n^3 + 869n^2 + 306n + 40)}{40}$>>>"
