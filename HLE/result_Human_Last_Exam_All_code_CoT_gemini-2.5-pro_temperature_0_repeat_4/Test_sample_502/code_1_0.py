# Define the given parameters from the problem.
# The order of the group G.
group_order = 10000
# The number of variables in the polynomial ring R.
num_variables = 10

# A fundamental theorem in invariant theory states that for a finite group G,
# the dimension of the coinvariant algebra (R/I) is equal to the order of the group.
# This gives us the equation: dim(R/I) = |G|.
# This result is independent of the specific structure of G or its representation,
# as long as G is a finite group.

# The problem asks for the largest possible dimension of R/I.
# Since the dimension is always equal to the group's order, which is fixed,
# the dimension is constant.
dimension_of_ring = group_order

# As requested, we output the numbers in the final equation.
