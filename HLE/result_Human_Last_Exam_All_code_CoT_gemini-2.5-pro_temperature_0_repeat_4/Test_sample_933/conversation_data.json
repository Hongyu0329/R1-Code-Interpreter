    "To determine the coldest temperature for the efficient synthesis of Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF₄), we need to examine the standard methods of its production.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Synthesis Reaction:** The primary method for producing Xenon tetrafluoride is the direct reaction between xenon (Xe) and fluorine (F₂) gas.\n2.  **Analyze Reaction Conditions:** The product of the reaction between xenon and fluorine is highly dependent on the reaction conditions, such as temperature, pressure, and the molar ratio of the reactants.\n    *   To produce XeF₂, a large excess of Xenon is typically used at around 400 °C.\n    *   To produce XeF₄, a molar ratio of approximately 1:5 (Xenon to Fluorine) is heated to **400 °C**.\n    *   To produce XeF₆, a higher pressure, a large excess of fluorine (e.g., 1:20 ratio), and higher temperatures (250-300 °C, but often requiring higher temperatures like 500-600 °C for good rates) are needed.\n3.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   At temperatures significantly lower than 400 °C (like 200 °C or below), the reaction rate becomes very slow, making the process inefficient.\n    *   At temperatures significantly higher than 400 °C (like 600 °C), the reaction tends to favor the formation of Xenon hexafluoride (XeF₆), especially if fluorine is not the limiting reactant.\n4.  **Conclusion:** Therefore, 400 °C is the optimal and most commonly cited temperature for the efficient synthesis of XeF₄. It provides a good balance between reaction rate and selectivity for the desired product.\n\nThe following Python code will outline these conditions and identify the correct answer from the choices provided.\n\n```python\ndef find_synthesis_temperature():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides information on the synthesis of Xenon Fluorides\n    and determines the optimal temperature for producing Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF4).\n    \"\"\"\n    # Data on the synthesis of different Xenon Fluorides\n    synthesis_data = {\n        \"Xenon difluoride (XeF2)\": {\n            \"conditions\": \"Excess Xenon gas reacted with Fluorine gas.\",\n            \"temperature_C\": 400,\n            \"notes\": \"Although the temperature is 400 C, the product is controlled by using a large excess of Xenon.\"\n        },\n        \"Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF4)\": {\n            \"conditions\": \"Xenon and Fluorine gases in a 1:5 molar ratio.\",\n            \"temperature_C\": 400,\n            \"notes\": \"This temperature provides an efficient rate of reaction and yield for XeF4.\"\n        },\n        \"Xenon hexafluoride (XeF6)\": {\n            \"conditions\": \"Xenon reacted with a large excess of Fluorine gas at high pressure.\",\n            \"temperature_C\": 600, # Often cited as >300 C, but 500-600 C is used for good rates.\n            \"notes\": \"Higher temperatures and excess fluorine favor the formation of XeF6.\"\n        }\n    }\n\n    target_compound = \"Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF4)\"\n    \n    if target_compound in synthesis_data:\n        data = synthesis_data[target_compound]\n        temp = data[\"temperature_C\"]\n        \n        print(f\"Synthesizing {target_compound}:\")\n        print(f\"  - Conditions: {data['conditions']}\")\n        print(f\"  - Optimal Temperature: {temp}°C\")\n        print(f\"  - Notes: {data['notes']}\")\n        print(\"\\nComparing this with the given answer choices:\")\n        \n        answer_choices = {\n            \"A\": 600,\n            \"B\": 400,\n            \"C\": 200,\n            \"D\": 78,\n            \"E\": 0,\n            \"F\": -78\n        }\n        \n        correct_choice = None\n        for choice, value in answer_choices.items():\n            print(f\"  {choice}. {value}°C\")\n            if value == temp:\n                correct_choice = choice\n        \n        if correct_choice:\n            print(f\"\\nThe temperature {temp}°C corresponds to choice {correct_choice}.\")\n        else:\n            print(\"\\nThe optimal temperature is not listed in the choices.\")\n\nfind_synthesis_temperature()\n<<<B>>>\n```"
