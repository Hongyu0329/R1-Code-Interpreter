    # The space is composed of a segment L and a series of segments L_n.

    # The problem states "each L_n be the line segment from p_1 to the origin".

    # This means L_1, L_2, L_3, ... are all the same segment, from (1, 1) to (0, 0).

    # a line segment with one endpoint removed, which is a connected set.
