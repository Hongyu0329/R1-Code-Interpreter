    "Of course. Here is my plan to solve the equation:\n\n1.  First, I need to convert the Roman numerals in the equation (`XL`, `CCC`, and `CCMCMXCIX`) into modern numbers.\n2.  I will create a Python function to handle this conversion. While `XL` (40) and `CCC` (300) are standard, `CCMCMXCIX` is not. A standard programmatic approach would parse it from left to right, applying subtraction rules. This interprets `CCMCMXCIX` as `C + CM + CM + XC + IX`, which calculates to `100 + 900 + 900 + 90 + 9 = 1999`. I will use this value.\n3.  Once all numbers are converted, the equation becomes `40 / 300 - 1999`.\n4.  Finally, I will write the Python code to perform this calculation and print the result. The code will also display the equation with the converted numbers as requested.\n\n```python\ndef roman_to_int(s):\n    \"\"\"Converts a Roman numeral string to an integer.\"\"\"\n    rom_val = {'I': 1, 'V': 5, 'X': 10, 'L': 50, 'C': 100, 'D': 500, 'M': 1000}\n    int_val = 0\n    i = 0\n    while i < len(s):\n        # Check for subtractive notation (e.g., IV, IX, XL, XC, CD, CM)\n        if i + 1 < len(s) and rom_val[s[i]] < rom_val[s[i+1]]:\n            int_val += rom_val[s[i+1]] - rom_val[s[i]]\n            i += 2\n        else:\n            int_val += rom_val[s[i]]\n            i += 1\n    return int_val\n\n# Roman numerals from the equation\nr1 = \"XL\"\nr2 = \"CCC\"\nr3 = \"CCMCMXCIX\"\n\n# Convert Roman numerals to integers\nn1 = roman_to_int(r1)\nn2 = roman_to_int(r2)\nn3 = roman_to_int(r3)\n\n# Perform the calculation\nresult = n1 / n2 - n3\n\n# Print the equation with modern numbers\nprint(f\"The equation is: {n1} / {n2} - {n3} = ?\")\n\n# Print the final answer\nprint(f\"The solution is: {result}\")\n\n# The final answer in the required format\nprint(f\"<<<{result}>>>\")\n```"
