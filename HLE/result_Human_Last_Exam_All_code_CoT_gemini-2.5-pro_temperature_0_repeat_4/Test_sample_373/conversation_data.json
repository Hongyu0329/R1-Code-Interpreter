    "To solve this problem, we first need to understand the structure of the specified barbell graph and the process of randomized uniform gossiping.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Define the Barbell Graph:** A barbell graph with 10 nodes is typically constructed by taking two complete graphs (cliques) of 5 nodes each and connecting them with a single edge. This connecting edge is the \"bottleneck.\"\n2.  **Understand the Gossiping Process:** In randomized uniform gossiping, the sampling of an edge `(u, v)` happens in two steps:\n    *   First, a node `u` is selected uniformly at random from all `N` nodes in the graph. The probability of selecting any specific node is `1/N`.\n    *   Second, the selected node `u` chooses one of its neighbors `v` uniformly at random. The probability of choosing a specific neighbor `v` is `1/deg(u)`, where `deg(u)` is the degree (number of neighbors) of node `u`.\n3.  **Identify the Bottleneck Edge:** Let the two cliques be C1 and C2, and let the bottleneck edge connect node `u` in C1 to node `v` in C2.\n4.  **Calculate Node Degrees:**\n    *   Node `u` is connected to 4 other nodes within its K5 clique and to node `v`. So, `deg(u) = 4 + 1 = 5`.\n    *   Similarly, node `v` is connected to 4 other nodes within its K5 clique and to node `u`. So, `deg(v) = 4 + 1 = 5`.\n5.  **Calculate the Probability:** The bottleneck edge `(u, v)` can be sampled in two ways:\n    *   Node `u` is selected, and it chooses `v`. The probability of this is `P(select u) * P(u chooses v) = (1/10) * (1/5)`.\n    *   Node `v` is selected, and it chooses `u`. The probability of this is `P(select v) * P(v chooses u) = (1/10) * (1/5)`.\n    *   The total probability is the sum of these two probabilities: `(1/10) * (1/5) + (1/10) * (1/5) = 1/50 + 1/50 = 2/50 = 0.04`.\n\nThe following Python code will perform this calculation and print the final equation and result.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_bottleneck_probability():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the probability of sampling the bottleneck edge in a barbell graph\n    with 10 nodes during randomized uniform gossiping.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Total number of nodes in the graph\n    total_nodes = 10\n\n    # A standard 10-node barbell graph consists of two 5-node cliques.\n    clique_size = 5\n\n    # The bottleneck edge connects one node from each clique.\n    # Let's find the degree of a node connected to the bottleneck edge.\n    # It's connected to (clique_size - 1) nodes in its own clique\n    # and 1 node (the other end of the bottleneck) in the other clique.\n    degree_of_bottleneck_node = (clique_size - 1) + 1\n\n    # The probability of selecting any single node is 1 / total_nodes\n    p_select_node = 1 / total_nodes\n\n    # The probability of a selected bottleneck node choosing its neighbor\n    # across the bottleneck is 1 / its degree.\n    p_choose_bottleneck_neighbor = 1 / degree_of_bottleneck_node\n\n    # The total probability is the sum of two scenarios:\n    # 1.
