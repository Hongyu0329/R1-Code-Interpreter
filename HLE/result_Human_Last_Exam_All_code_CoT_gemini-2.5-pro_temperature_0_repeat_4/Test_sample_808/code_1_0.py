    Solves the problem of identifying which modified Platonic solids become non-planar.

    The problem considers the five Platonic solids, which are the only graphs that are
    3-connected, regular, and have regular faces. They are ordered by their number of vertices.

    The modification procedure takes a single face (a cycle of k vertices) and adds edges
    to make it a complete graph (K_k).

    A graph is non-planar if it contains a K_5 or K_{3,3} minor.
