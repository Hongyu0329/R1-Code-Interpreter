    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n1.  First, I will analyze the given sequence to find the relationship between consecutive numbers.\n2.  I will calculate the differences between each pair of consecutive numbers in the sequence.\n3.  Then, I will analyze the new sequence of differences to find its underlying pattern. It appears that the pattern is of the form `d(n) = 2 * d(n-1) + c(n)`.\n4.  I will identify the pattern for the added term `c(n)`, which seems to be a geometric progression.\n5.  Using these discovered patterns, I will calculate the next difference in the sequence.\n6.  Finally, I will add this calculated difference to the last number in the original sequence to find the missing number.\n\n```python\ndef find_next_number():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the number sequence puzzle by finding the pattern in the differences.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The given sequence\n    sequence = [2, 11, 23, 51, 119]\n    print(f\"The original sequence is: {', '.join(map(str, sequence))}\")\n\n    # Step 1: Calculate the differences between consecutive terms\n    differences = [sequence[i+1] - sequence[i] for i in range(len(sequence)-1)]\n    print(f\"The differences between consecutive terms are: {', '.join(map(str, differences))}\")\n    print(\"Let's find the pattern in this new sequence of differences: 9, 12, 28, 68.\")\n\n    # Step 2: Analyze the pattern in the differences\n    # d(n) = 2 * d(n-1) + c\n    # 28 = 2 * 12 + 4\n    # 68 = 2 * 28 + 12\n    c1 = differences[2] - 2 * differences[1]\n    c2 = differences[3] - 2 * differences[2]\n    print(f\"The pattern for the differences seems to be d(n) = 2 * d(n-1) + c(n).\")\n    print(f\"Let's check:\")\n    print(f\"{differences[2]} = 2 * {differences[1]} + {c1}\")\n    print(f\"{differences[3]} = 2 * {differences[2]} + {c2}\")\n    \n    # The added terms c(n) form a geometric progression: 4, 12, ...\n    # The common ratio is 12 / 4 = 3\n    common_ratio = c2 / c1\n    print(f\"The added terms are {c1}, {c2}, ...
