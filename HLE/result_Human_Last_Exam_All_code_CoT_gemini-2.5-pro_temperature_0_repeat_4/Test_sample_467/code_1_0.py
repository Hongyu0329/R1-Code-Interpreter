# Step 1: Define the degree of the Gauss map.
# The Gauss map is g(z) = z / (z^3 + 2).
# The degree 'd' is the maximum of the degrees of the numerator and the denominator.
# deg(z) = 1
# deg(z^3 + 2) = 3
# d = max(1, 3)
d = 3

# Step 2: Calculate the Morse index using the formula for surfaces of genus 0 with one end.
# The formula is Index = 2d - 1.
index = 2 * d - 1

# Step 3: Print the final equation with all the numbers.
print(f"The degree of the Gauss map is d = {d}.")
print("Using the formula Index = 2d - 1, the calculation is:")
print(f"2 * {d} - 1 = {index}")
