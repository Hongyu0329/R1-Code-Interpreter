    "Of course, I can help with that. This is a problem in algebraic topology, specifically homotopy theory. The solution involves determining the connectivity of the spaces involved, identifying their first non-trivial homotopy groups, and then analyzing the map's effect on these groups.\n\nHere is my plan to solve this problem:\n1.  **Analyze the Spaces**: I will first determine the connectivity of the source space, $A = \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$, and the target space, $B = \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$. Connectivity of a space $X$ is the largest integer $k$ such that all homotopy groups $\\pi_i(X)$ are trivial for $i \\le k$.\n2.  **Compute First Homotopy Groups**: I will then compute the first non-trivial homotopy group for both the source and target spaces. This will occur in dimension $k+1$, where $k$ is the connectivity.\n3.  **Analyze the Map**: The map $f: A \\to B$ is a standard map in homotopy theory, related to the Whitehead product. I will explain its construction as a lift of the Whitehead product map $W: \\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to S^4 \\vee S^6$ through the fibration with fiber $\\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$.\n4.  **Determine the Map's Connectivity**: By analyzing the map's effect on the first non-trivial homotopy groups, I will determine if it is an isomorphism in that dimension. The connectivity of the map $f$ is the largest integer $k$ such that $f_*: \\pi_i(A) \\to \\pi_i(B)$ is an isomorphism for all $i < k$ and a surjection for $i = k$.\n5.  **Code the Solution**: I will write a Python script that automates the calculations from steps 1 and 2 and prints the entire reasoning, including the theoretical argument from step 3, to arrive at the final answer.\n\nHere is the Python code that carries out this plan.\n\n```python\nimport re\n\n# A simple cache for our recursive functions\nmemo_conn = {}\nmemo_pi = {}\n\ndef get_connectivity(space_str):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the connectivity of a space defined by a string representation.\n    This function uses standard rules from homotopy theory.\n    \"\"\"\n    if space_str in memo_conn:\n        return memo_conn[space_str]\n\n    # Base case: Sphere S^n\n    match = re.fullmatch(r\"S\\^(\\d+)\", space_str)\n    if match:\n        n = int(match.group(1))\n        # A sphere S^n is (n-1)-connected.\n        result = n -
