    "To compute the Poincaré polynomial of the given Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Lie Algebra Structure**: The Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$ is 6-dimensional, with the non-zero commutation relations $[e_1, e_2] = e_3$, $[e_1, e_3] = e_4$, and $[e_1, e_5] = e_6$. We first check if this algebra is nilpotent by computing its descending central series:\n    *   $\\mathfrak{g}^1 = [\\mathfrak{g}, \\mathfrak{g}] = \\text{span}\\{e_3, e_4, e_6\\}$.\n    *   $\\mathfrak{g}^2 = [\\mathfrak{g}, \\mathfrak{g}^1] = \\text{span}\\{[e_1, e_3]\\} = \\text{span}\\{e_4\\}$.\n    *   $\\mathfrak{g}^3 = [\\mathfrak{g}, \\mathfrak{g}^2] = \\text{span}\\{[e_1, e_4]\\} = \\{0\\}$.\n    Since the series terminates at the zero ideal, the Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$ is nilpotent.\n\n2.  **Apply the Theorem for Nilpotent Lie Algebras**: For a nilpotent Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$, its homology $H_*(\\mathfrak{g}, \\mathbb{R})$ is isomorphic to the exterior algebra of its abelianization, $\\Lambda^*(\\mathfrak{g}/[\\mathfrak{g}, \\mathfrak{g}])$. The Poincaré polynomial is the generating function for the dimensions of the homology groups (the Betti numbers, $b_k = \\dim H_k(\\mathfrak{g})$).\n\n3.  **Calculate Betti Numbers**: The dimension of the abelianization is $b_1 = \\dim(\\mathfrak{g}/[\\mathfrak{g}, \\mathfrak{g}]) = \\dim(\\mathfrak{g}) - \\dim([\\mathfrak{g}, \\mathfrak{g}])$.\n    *   $\\dim(\\mathfrak{g}) = 6$.\n    *   The derived algebra $[\\mathfrak{g}, \\mathfrak{g}]$ is spanned by $\\{e_3, e_4, e_6\\}$, which are linearly independent. So, $\\dim([\\mathfrak{g}, \\mathfrak{g}]) = 3$.\n    *   Therefore, $b_1 = 6 - 3 = 3$.\n    The Betti numbers are then given by the binomial coefficients $b_k = \\binom{b_1}{k} = \\binom{3}{k}$.\n    *   $b_0 = \\binom{3}{0} = 1$\n    *   $b_1 = \\binom{3}{1} = 3$\n    *   $b_2 = \\binom{3}{2} = 3$\n    *   $b_3 = \\binom{3}{3} = 1$\n    *   $b_k = 0$ for $k > 3$.\n\n4.  **Construct the Poincaré Polynomial**: The polynomial is $P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\dim \\mathfrak{g}} b_k x^k$.\n    *   $P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = b_0 + b_1 x + b_2 x^2 + b_3 x^3 = 1 + 3x + 3x^2 + x^3$.\n\nThe following Python code automates this calculation and prints the resulting polynomial.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef compute_poincare_polynomial():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes and prints the Poincaré polynomial for the specified Lie algebra.\n\n    The Lie algebra g is 6-dimensional with relations:\n    [e1, e2] = e3, [e1, e3] = e4, [e1, e5] = e6.\n\n    This algebra is nilpotent.
