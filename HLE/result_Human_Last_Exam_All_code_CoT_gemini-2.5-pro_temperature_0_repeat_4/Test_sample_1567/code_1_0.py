# The problem asks for the maximal integer k such that for any set of k
# d-dimensional (d>=3) probability measures with mean 0 and bounded support,
# a controlled random walk cannot be guaranteed to be recurrent.

# As explained in the reasoning above, a key property of this walk is that
# the expected squared distance from the origin, E[||X_n||^2], grows at least
# linearly with the number of steps, n.
# This holds true regardless of the control strategy or the number of measures k,
# as long as k is finite.

# This behavior is a strong indicator of transience. More rigorous arguments
# from potential theory confirm that it is not possible to force recurrence
# for such a walk in dimensions d>=3. The walk is always transient.

# Therefore, the statement "we are not able to guarantee that the controlled
# random walk will return to the origin" is true for any finite k.

# The question asks for the maximal k for which this statement is true.
# Since the statement is true for k=1, k=2, k=3, ..., and for all integers,
# there is no largest integer k. The answer is therefore infinity.

# This is a conceptual problem, so the code simply prints the reasoned answer.
# There is no equation with numbers to output.
answer = "infinity"
