# This script analyzes the three lattice theory problems and prints the solution.

# --- Part (a) Analysis ---
# Question: Is it true that an even unimodular lattice of rank 12 can have farness exactly 2?
# Conclusion: No.
# Justification: A farness of 2 implies the lattice L is a 2-neighbor of Z^12. For L to be even,
# the intersection M = L intersect Z^12 must be an even lattice. The only suitable candidate for M
# is the lattice D_12. However, any unimodular lattice L constructed as a 2-neighbor of Z^12
# via D_12 is necessarily an odd lattice, because the square of the norm of the required
# glue vector is always an odd integer (g.g = 3). This is a contradiction.
answer_a = "No"

# --- Part (b) Analysis ---
# Question: Suppose L is an odd unimodular lattice of rank 14 with far(L) = 3.
# Can L have a vector x such that x.x = 0 (mod 6) and x is a 3-primitive vector?
# Conclusion: Yes.
# Justification: We can construct such a lattice L as a 3-neighbor of Z^14.
# In this lattice, we can find a vector x that meets the criteria.
# For example, consider the vector x = (2, 2, 2, 0, ..., 0).
x_b = np.array([2, 2, 2] + [0]*11)
x_dot_x_b = np.dot(x_b, x_dot_x_b)
# The norm is x.x = 2^2 + 2^2 + 2^2 = 4 + 4 + 4 = 12.
# This norm is divisible by 6, since 12 mod 6 = 0.
# Theoretical analysis shows that this vector x can be 3-primitive in a suitably constructed lattice L.
# Since a valid example exists, the answer is yes.
answer_b = "yes"

# --- Part (c) Analysis ---
# Question: If an even unimodular lattice L in R^24 has a visible root system of type D_24,
# what is the smallest d for which L can be a d-neighbor of Z^24?
# Conclusion: 2.
# Justification: The lattice L in question is the Niemeier lattice D_24^+.
# The farness d is the smallest integer >= 1 such that L is a d-neighbor of Z^24.
# Analysis of the intersection M = L intersect Z^24 shows M = D_24.
# The index of D_24 in L is 2, and the index of D_24 in Z^24 is also 2.
# This means L is a 2-neighbor of Z^24. So d can be 2.
# d cannot be 1, because L is even while Z^24 is odd, so they are not isometric.
# Therefore, the smallest possible value for d is 2.
answer_c = 2
