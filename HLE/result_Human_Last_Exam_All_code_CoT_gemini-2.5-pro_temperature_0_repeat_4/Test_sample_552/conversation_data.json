    "I will find the answer to this historical question and then present it in a Python code block as requested.\n\nThe question asks whose lectures Albert Einstein cited in his 1905 paper on Brownian motion. This paper, one of his four *Annus Mirabilis* (miracle year) papers, was titled \"Über die von der molekularkinetischen Theorie der Wärme geforderte Bewegung von in ruhenden Flüssigkeiten suspendierten Teilchen\" (\"On the Motion of Small Particles Suspended in a Stationary Liquid, as Required by the Molecular-Kinetic Theory of Heat\").\n\nEinstein's work on this topic was heavily based on the principles of statistical mechanics and the kinetic theory of heat. The primary pioneer and most significant figure in this field was Ludwig Boltzmann. While Einstein's paper was groundbreaking in its own right and had very few citations, it was built upon the theoretical framework established by Boltzmann, whose ideas were famously disseminated through his publications and lectures, such as his \"Lectures on Gas Theory.\"\n\nTherefore, the code will print the name of this influential physicist.\n\n```python\ndef get_cited_lecturer():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function returns the name of the physicist whose work and lectures\n  on statistical mechanics and the kinetic theory of heat were a\n  foundational basis for Albert Einstein's 1905 paper on Brownian motion.\n  \"\"\"\n  lecturer_name = \"Ludwig Boltzmann\"\n  print(f\"The lectures and works of Ludwig Boltzmann on the kinetic theory of heat were a key foundation for Albert Einstein's 1905 paper on Brownian motion.\")\n\nget_cited_lecturer()\n```\n<<<Ludwig Boltzmann>>>"

Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
