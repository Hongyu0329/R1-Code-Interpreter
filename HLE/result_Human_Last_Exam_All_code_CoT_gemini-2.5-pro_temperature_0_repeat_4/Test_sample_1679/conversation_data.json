    "To solve this, I will identify the first Academy Award winner for Best Picture that features a Luxor Obelisk. There are two such obelisks: one in Luxor, Egypt, and one at the Place de la Concorde in Paris, France. My approach is to chronologically review the Best Picture winners and their settings to find the first movie that depicts either of these locations.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Create a chronological list of early Best Picture winners.\n2.  For each film, identify its primary setting.\n3.  Check if the setting is Paris or Egypt, where a Luxor Obelisk is located.\n4.  The first film on the list that is known to visually feature the obelisk will be the answer. While some earlier films might be set in Paris (like *The Life of Emile Zola*), *An American in Paris* is famous for its stylized musical sequences that explicitly showcase Parisian landmarks, including the Place de la Concorde with its obelisk.\n\nThe following Python script automates this search through a predefined list of movie data.\n\n```python\ndef find_first_movie_with_obelisk():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function searches through a chronological list of early Academy Award\n    Best Picture winners to find the first one known to depict a Luxor Obelisk.\n    The two obelisks are in Luxor, Egypt, and Paris, France.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Data structure: (Year of Award, \"Title\", \"Primary Setting\", Known to Feature Obelisk)\n    # The list is ordered chronologically by the award year.\n    best_picture_winners = [\n        (1928, \"Wings\", \"France/USA\", False),\n        (1929, \"The Broadway Melody\", \"USA\", False),\n        (1930, \"All Quiet on the Western Front\", \"Germany\", False),\n        (1931, \"Cimarron\", \"USA\", False),\n        (1932, \"Grand Hotel\", \"Germany\", False),\n        (1933, \"Cavalcade\", \"UK\", False),\n        (1934, \"It Happened One Night\", \"USA\", False),\n        (1935, \"Mutiny on the Bounty\", \"Ocean/Tahiti\", False),\n        (1936, \"The Great Ziegfeld\", \"USA\", False),\n        (1937, \"The Life of Emile Zola\", \"Paris\", False),\n        (1938, \"You Can't Take It with You\", \"USA\", False),\n        (1939, \"Gone with the Wind\", \"USA\", False),\n        (1940, \"Rebecca\", \"UK\", False),\n        (1941, \"How Green Was My Valley\", \"UK\", False),\n        (1942, \"Mrs. Miniver\", \"UK\", False),\n        (1943, \"Casablanca\", \"Morocco\", False),\n        (1944, \"Going My Way\", \"USA\", False),\n        (1945, \"The Lost Weekend\", \"USA\", False),\n        (1946, \"The Best Years of Our Lives\", \"USA\", False),\n        (1947, \"Gentleman's Agreement\", \"USA\", False),\n        (1948, \"Hamlet\", \"Denmark\", False),\n        (1949, \"All the King's Men\", \"USA\", False),\n        (1950, \"All About Eve\", \"USA\", False),\n        (1951, \"An American in Paris\", \"Paris\", True),\n        (1952, \"The Greatest Show on Earth\", \"USA\", False),\n        (1953, \"From Here to Eternity\", \"USA\", False),\n        (1954, \"On the Waterfront\", \"USA\", False),\n        (1955, \"Marty\", \"USA\", False),\n        (1956, \"Around the World in 80 Days\", \"Global\", True),\n    ]\n\n    # Iterate through the list to find the first match\n    for year, title, setting, features_obelisk in best_picture_winners:\n        if features_obelisk:\n            print(f\"Searching for the first Best Picture winner featuring a Luxor Obelisk...\")\n            print(f\"Found a match: '{title}' ({year})\")\n            print(f\"This film is set in {setting} and is known to depict the Luxor Obelisk at the Place de la Concorde.\")\n            return title\n    return None\n\n# Run the search and print the final answer\nfound_movie = find_first_movie_with_obelisk()\nif not found_movie:\n    print(\"Could not determine the answer from the provided data.\")\n\n```\n<<<An American in Paris>>>"
