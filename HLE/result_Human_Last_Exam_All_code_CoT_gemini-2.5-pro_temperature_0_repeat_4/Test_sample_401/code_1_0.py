1.  **Core Concepts**:
    *   A **continuum** is a compact, connected Hausdorff space.
    *   An **indecomposable continuum** is a continuum that cannot be written as the union of two of its proper subcontinua. A proper subcontinuum is a subset that is a continuum itself but is not the entire space.
    *   A **composant** of a continuum is a specific type of path-connected subset. The collection of all composants of a continuum forms a partition of the space (i.e., they are disjoint and their union is the entire space).
"""

    # Step 2: State the theorem that provides a lower bound.
    explanation_part2 = """
2.  **A Key Theorem**:
    A fundamental theorem in the study of continua states that a continuum is indecomposable if and only if it has more than one composant. This means that any indecomposable continuum must have at least 2 composants. This establishes that the smallest possible number is greater than 1.
"""

    # Step 3: Discuss the role of the metric property.
    explanation_part3 = """
3.  **Metric vs. Non-Metric Spaces**:
    The properties of composants depend on whether the space is metric (has a distance function).
    *   For any **metric** indecomposable continuum (e.g., the pseudo-arc), it is a known result that it must have uncountably many composants.
    *   However, the question explicitly states "not necessarily metric". This allows for the consideration of more general topological spaces.
"""

    # Step 4: State the existence of a minimal example.
    explanation_part4 = """
4.  **Existence of a Minimum**:
    In the field of general topology, mathematicians have constructed examples of **non-metric** indecomposable continua that have a finite number of composants. Specifically, it is possible to construct an indecomposable continuum that has exactly 2 composants.
"""

    # Step 5: Conclude and state the final answer.
    explanation_part5 = """
5.  **Conclusion**:
    Given that an indecomposable continuum must have more than 1 composant, and that examples with exactly 2 composants are known to exist (in the non-metric case), the smallest possible number of composants is 2.
