    "This is a question from the field of point-set topology. While it's a theoretical question, I will provide the answer and the reasoning within a Python script as requested.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Define the key terms from the question: \"continuum\", \"indecomposable continuum\", and \"composant\".\n2.  State the fundamental theorem that connects the number of composants to whether a continuum is indecomposable. This will establish a lower bound.\n3.  Discuss the difference between metric and non-metric continua, as this is crucial to the answer.\n4.  State the existence of continua that meet the lower bound.\n5.  Conclude and print the final numerical answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_smallest_number_of_composants():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides a step-by-step explanation to determine the smallest\n    number of composants an indecomposable continuum can have.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Define the relevant topological terms.\n    explanation_part1 = \"\"\"\n1.  **Core Concepts**:\n    *   A **continuum** is a compact, connected Hausdorff space.\n    *   An **indecomposable continuum** is a continuum that cannot be written as the union of two of its proper subcontinua. A proper subcontinuum is a subset that is a continuum itself but is not the entire space.\n    *   A **composant** of a continuum is a specific type of path-connected subset. The collection of all composants of a continuum forms a partition of the space (i.e., they are disjoint and their union is the entire space).\n\"\"\"\n\n    # Step 2: State the theorem that provides a lower bound.\n    explanation_part2 = \"\"\"\n2.  **A Key Theorem**:\n    A fundamental theorem in the study of continua states that a continuum is indecomposable if and only if it has more than one composant. This means that any indecomposable continuum must have at least 2 composants. This establishes that the smallest possible number is greater than 1.\n\"\"\"\n\n    # Step 3: Discuss the role of the metric property.\n    explanation_part3 = \"\"\"\n3.  **Metric vs. Non-Metric Spaces**:\n    The properties of composants depend on whether the space is metric (has a distance function).\n    *   For any **metric** indecomposable continuum (e.g., the pseudo-arc), it is a known result that it must have uncountably many composants.\n    *   However, the question explicitly states \"not necessarily metric\". This allows for the consideration of more general topological spaces.\n\"\"\"\n\n    # Step 4: State the existence of a minimal example.\n    explanation_part4 = \"\"\"\n4.  **Existence of a Minimum**:\n    In the field of general topology, mathematicians have constructed examples of **non-metric** indecomposable continua that have a finite number of composants. Specifically, it is possible to construct an indecomposable continuum that has exactly 2 composants.\n\"\"\"\n\n    # Step 5: Conclude and state the final answer.\n    explanation_part5 = \"\"\"\n5.  **Conclusion**:\n    Given that an indecomposable continuum must have more than 1 composant, and that examples with exactly 2 composants are known to exist (in the non-metric case), the smallest possible number of composants is 2.\n\"\"\"\n\n    final_answer = 2\n\n    print(\"Here is the reasoning to find the answer:\")\n    print(explanation_part1)\n    print(explanation_part2)\n    print(explanation_part3)\n    print(explanation_part4)\n    print(explanation_part5)\n    print(\"-----------------------------------------------------------------\")\n    print(f\"The final answer is the number: {final_answer}\")\n\n\n# Execute the function to print the explanation and the answer.\nfind_smallest_number_of_composants()\n```\n<<<2>>>"
