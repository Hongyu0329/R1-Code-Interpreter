    "Of course, I can help with that. This is a historical question, so I will first find the information and then present it to you using a Python script as requested.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Research historical records to identify the name of the judge (also known as a magistrate or *richtár*) of the town of Bártfa (modern-day Bardejov) for the year 1461.\n2.  Create a Python script that stores the year, the town's names, and the judge's name in variables.\n3.  Use a `print()` function to output a clear sentence stating the answer, ensuring the year `1461` is included in the final output.\n\n```python\ndef find_judge_of_bartfa():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides the name of the judge of Bártfa (Bardejov) in 1461.\n    \"\"\"\n    year = 1461\n    city_hungarian = \"Bártfa\"\n    city_slovak = \"Bardejov\"\n    judge_name = \"Jakub Gocz\"\n\n    print(f\"The judge of {city_hungarian} (now {city_slovak}) in the year {year} was {judge_name}.\")\n\nfind_judge_of_bartfa()\n```\n<<<Jakub Gocz>>>"
