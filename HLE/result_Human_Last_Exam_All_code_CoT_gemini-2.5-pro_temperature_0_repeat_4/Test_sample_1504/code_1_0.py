    This function provides the solution to the Turan-type extremal problem.
    The reasoning is as follows:
    (a) True. A graph G not being a union of K2s implies it has a component with at least 3 vertices.
        General results show that for any such G, ex(n; G, K_{1,t}-ind) is O(n). A construction of disjoint
        cliques provides a lower bound of Omega(n). Thus, the function is Theta(n).
    (b) True. A graph being sK2-free implies it has a vertex cover of size at most 2(s-1). This means
        all edges are incident to a finite set of vertices, and the K_{1,t}-ind condition bounds the
        number of edges connected to this set. The total number of edges is therefore bounded by a
        function of s and t, independent of n.
    (c) The upper bound is determined by finding the maximum number of edges in a graph that is both
        sK2-free and K_{1,t}-ind-free. We consider two main candidates for the extremal graph:
        1. The complete graph K_{2s-1}, which has binom(2s-1, 2) edges.
        2. The graph join of K_{s-1} and t-1 independent vertices, which has
           binom(s-1, 2) + (s-1)(t-1) edges.
        The extremal function is the maximum of these two values.
