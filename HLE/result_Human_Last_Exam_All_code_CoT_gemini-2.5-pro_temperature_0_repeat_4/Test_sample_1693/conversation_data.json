    "To answer this question, I will write a Python script that processes a pre-compiled list of notable French ships sunk by German U-boats between September 1939 and the armistice on June 22, 1940.\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  I will create a list of Python dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a ship and contains its name, type, and displacement in tons. The displacement for cargo ships and tankers is considered at full load, as this best represents their maximum size.\n2.  The script will then iterate through this list to identify the ship with the largest displacement.\n3.  Finally, it will print the name and displacement of that ship to the console.\n\n```python\ndef find_largest_sunk_ship():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the largest French ship by displacement sunk by a U-boat\n    before the armistice of June 22, 1940.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Data on notable French ships sunk by U-boats in the specified period.\n    # Displacement is the most relevant metric for \"largest\" and is estimated\n    # at full load for cargo/tanker vessels.\n    ships_sunk = [\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Bretagne\",\n            \"type\": \"Passenger Liner\",\n            \"displacement_tons\": 14115\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Brazza\",\n            \"type\": \"Passenger Liner\",\n            \"displacement_tons\": 14000\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Sheherazade\",\n            \"type\": \"Tanker\",\n            \"displacement_tons\": 27200  # Estimated full load displacement (Lightship + Deadweight)\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Champagne\",\n            \"type\": \"Cargo Ship\",\n            \"displacement_tons\": 18000 # Estimated full load displacement\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Doris\",\n            \"type\": \"Submarine\",\n            \"displacement_tons\": 600\n        }\n    ]\n\n    if not ships_sunk:\n        print(\"No ship data available.\")\n        return\n\n    # Find the ship with the maximum displacement\n    largest_ship = None\n    max_displacement = 0\n\n    for ship in ships_sunk:\n        if ship[\"displacement_tons\"] > max_displacement:\n            max_displacement = ship[\"displacement_tons\"]\n            largest_ship = ship\n\n    # Print the result\n    if largest_ship:\n        print(\"The largest French ship by displacement to be sunk by a U-boat before the 1940 armistice was:\")\n        print(f\"Name: {largest_ship['name']}\")\n        print(f\"Type: {largest_ship['type']}\")\n        print(f\"Displacement: {largest_ship['displacement_tons']} tons\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Could not determine the largest ship.\")\n\nfind_largest_sunk_ship()\n```\n<<<Sheherazade>>>"
