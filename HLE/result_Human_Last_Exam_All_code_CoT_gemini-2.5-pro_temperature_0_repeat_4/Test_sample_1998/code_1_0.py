def solve_quadratic_form_problem():
    """
    This script solves for the smallest natural number N with the property that,
    for every anisotropic quadratic form Q in N variables over a specific field K,
    the map defined by Q is surjective.

    The field K is a complete discretely valued field of characteristic 2,
    whose residue field, let's call it k, is a local field of characteristic 2.
    This means K is a 2-dimensional local field, which can be represented as k((t)).

    The problem asks for the smallest N such that any N-dimensional anisotropic
    quadratic form over K is surjective (universal). This number N is equal to the
    u-invariant of the field K, denoted u(K).

    We use two key results from the algebraic theory of quadratic forms:
    1. The u-invariant of a local field k of characteristic 2 is 4.
    2. The u-invariant of a Laurent series field k((t)) over a field k of
       characteristic 2 is 2 * u(k).

    # The u-invariant of the residue field k (a local field of characteristic 2).
    u_k = 4
    print(f"The u-invariant of the residue field k, u(k), is: {u_k}")

    # The field K is k((t)). We use the formula u(K) = 2 * u(k).
    # Let's calculate u(K).
    u_K = 2 * u_k

    print(f"The u-invariant of K is calculated as: u(K) = 2 * u(k)")
    print(f"Substituting the value of u(k): u(K) = 2 * {u_k}")
    print(f"Therefore, u(K) = {u_K}")

    # The number N is equal to u(K).
    N = u_K
    print(f"\nThe smallest natural number N with the given property is equal to u(K).")
    print(f"So, the final answer is N = {N}.")
