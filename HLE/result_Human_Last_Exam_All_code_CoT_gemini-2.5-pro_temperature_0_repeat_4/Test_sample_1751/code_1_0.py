    # Step 1: Define the lipids and their key structural features.
    # C16-dihydroceramide has two fully saturated hydrocarbon chains (d18:0 and 16:0).
    # C16-ceramide has one unsaturated chain (d18:1, with a trans double bond) and one saturated chain (16:0).
    lipid_1 = "C16-dihydroceramide"
    lipid_2 = "C16-ceramide"

    # Step 2: Explain the relationship between structure and molecular packing.
    # Saturated chains are straight and can pack together very tightly and in an ordered fashion.
    # The trans double bond in C16-ceramide introduces a rigid kink, which disrupts this tight packing,
    # leading to a less ordered arrangement. This is consistent with the experimental observation provided.

    # Step 3: Relate molecular packing to surface area.
    # Tighter packing means that the molecules occupy less space. Therefore, the lipid that
    # packs more tightly will have a lower area per molecule and a lower overall surface area
    # when compressed in a monolayer.

    # Step 4: Conclude which lipid has the lower surface area.
    # Because its saturated chains allow for tighter packing, C16-dihydroceramide will have a lower surface area.
