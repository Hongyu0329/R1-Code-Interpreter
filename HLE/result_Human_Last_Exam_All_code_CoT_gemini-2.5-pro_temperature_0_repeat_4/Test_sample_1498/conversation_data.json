    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a Python script that provides the answer.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  First, I will identify the specific verses (bayt) in the poem 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam' that list the names of the prophets.\n2.  The poem introduces the list of 25 prophets in bayt 27.\n3.  The actual enumeration of the names begins in the subsequent bayt, number 28, which starts with \"هُمْ آدَمٌ إِدْرِيسُ نُوحٌ هُودُ مَعْ...\" (They are Adam, Idris, Nuh, Hud, along with...).\n4.  The list of names concludes in bayt 31, which ends with \"...عِيسَى وَطَهَ خَاتِمٌ دَعْ غَيَّا\" (...Isa and Taha [Muhammad], the seal, so leave misguidance).\n5.  I will write a Python script to store these starting and ending numbers in variables and then print a clear statement indicating the range.\n\n```python\ndef find_prophets_verses():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the range of verses (bayt)\n    in 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam' that mention the names of the prophets.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The bayt where the list of prophets' names begins\n    start_bayt = 28\n\n    # The bayt where the list of prophets' names ends\n    end_bayt = 31\n\n    print(\"In the poem 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam' by Sayyid Ahmad al-Marzuqi, the names of the Prophets are mentioned in the following range:\")\n    print(f\"From bayt: {start_bayt}\")\n    print(f\"To bayt: {end_bayt}\")\n\nfind_prophets_verses()\n<<<From bayt 28 to bayt 31>>>\n```"
