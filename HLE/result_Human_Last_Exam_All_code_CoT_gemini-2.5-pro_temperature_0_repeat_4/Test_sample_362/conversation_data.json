    "To determine the product of the Wittig reaction between pivalaldehyde and (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ⁵-phosphane, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants**: We have an aldehyde (pivalaldehyde) and a phosphorus ylide (the Wittig reagent).\n2.  **Analyze the Structures**:\n    *   Pivalaldehyde is (CH₃)₃C-CHO. The key feature is the carbonyl group (C=O). The part attached to the carbonyl carbon is a tert-butyl group, (CH₃)₃C-.\n    *   The Wittig reagent is (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ⁵-phosphane. The structure is Ph₃P=CH-CH₂-(C₆H₄Cl). The key feature is the carbon-phosphorus double bond (C=P). The carbon part that will form the new alkene is -CH-CH₂-(C₆H₄Cl).\n3.  **Simulate the Reaction**: The Wittig reaction mechanism involves the exchange of the oxygen atom from the aldehyde with the carbon group from the ylide. The C=O double bond of the aldehyde and the C=P double bond of the ylide break, and a new C=C double bond forms between the two carbon atoms, along with a P=O double bond (forming triphenylphosphine oxide as a byproduct).\n4.  **Construct the Product**: We combine the aldehyde's carbon skeleton with the ylide's carbon skeleton via a new double bond:\n    *   From pivalaldehyde: `(CH₃)₃C-CH=`\n    *   From the ylide: `=CH-CH₂-(C₆H₄Cl)`\n    *   Product: `(CH₃)₃C-CH=CH-CH₂-(C₆H₄Cl)`\n5.  **Name the Product**: The IUPAC name for this alkene is **1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene**. The numbers in the name indicate the positions of the substituents and the double bond on the main five-carbon (pentene) chain.\n\nThe following Python code formalizes this process and prints the final reaction equation and product name.\n\n```python\ndef solve_wittig_reaction():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script determines the product of a Wittig reaction by identifying the\n    reactants, breaking them down into their reacting fragments, and combining\n    the fragments to form the final product.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # 1.
