# The problem asks for the value of n, which is the length of a resolution for a functor F.
# Based on the analysis of the problem's terminology, the term "tame functor"
# is best interpreted as an indecomposable regular representation in a tame category.
# In the representation theory of posets and quivers, such regular representations
# typically have a projective dimension of 1.
# This leads to the conclusion that n = 1.
# The final equation is n = 1.
# The number to be output from this equation is 1.
