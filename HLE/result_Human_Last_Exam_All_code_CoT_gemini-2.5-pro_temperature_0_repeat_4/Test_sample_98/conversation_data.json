    "To determine the shape of the water surface in a half-filled icosahedron tank standing on a face, we can use principles of symmetry and geometry.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Analyze the Icosahedron's Geometry and Orientation:** A regular icosahedron is a polyhedron with 20 identical equilateral triangular faces, 30 edges, and 12 vertices. The tank is \"standing on one of its faces,\" which means this triangular face is horizontal and forms the base. Due to the icosahedron's symmetry, there is another triangular face perfectly parallel to the base at the top of the tank.\n2.  **Understand the \"Half-Filled\" Condition:** When the tank is half-filled, the water occupies half of the total volume. Because of the symmetry between the top and bottom of the icosahedron in this orientation, the plane that bisects the volume is the horizontal plane exactly halfway between the top and bottom faces. This plane represents the water's surface.\n3.  **Identify the Shape of the Cross-Section:** We need to find the shape formed by the intersection of this horizontal mid-plane with the icosahedron.\n    *   An icosahedron has 12 vertices. In this orientation, 3 vertices form the base triangle, and 3 vertices form the top triangle.\n    *   The remaining 6 vertices are situated around the \"equator\" of the icosahedron, between the top and bottom.\n    *   The horizontal mid-plane is a plane of reflection symmetry. For the arrangement of vertices to be symmetrical, these 6 equatorial vertices must lie exactly on this mid-plane.\n    *   Therefore, the vertices of the water's surface are these 6 equatorial vertices of the icosahedron.\n4.  **Determine if the Polygon is Regular:** The shape is a hexagon. To determine if it's a regular hexagon, we check its sides and angles.\n    *   **Sides:** By inspecting the structure of an icosahedron, we find that these 6 equatorial vertices are connected to each other by the icosahedron's edges. Since all edges of a regular icosahedron are equal in length, the hexagon is equilateral (all sides are equal).\n    *   **Angles:** The icosahedron, when stood on a face, has a 3-fold rotational symmetry axis passing vertically through the center of the base and top faces. This symmetry ensures that all internal angles of the hexagon are equal.\n5.  **Conclusion:** A hexagon that is both equilateral (equal sides) and equiangular (equal angles) is a **regular hexagon**.\n\nThe following Python code summarizes and prints this conclusion.\n\n```python\ndef solve_icosahedron_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines and prints the shape of the water surface in a half-filled icosahedron tank.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # An icosahedron is a regular polyhedron with 20 identical equilateral triangular faces.\n    # It is standing on one face, which is horizontal.\n    # By symmetry, there is a parallel face at the top.\n\n    # When the tank is half-filled, the water level is at a horizontal plane\n    # that bisects the volume.
