    "To determine the scaling exponent α for the specific heat in a system with spatial dimension d=3 using the epsilon expansion, we follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the Upper Critical Dimension (d_c):** For the universality class that includes the Ising model, the upper critical dimension is `d_c = 4`. Above this dimension, mean-field theory provides the correct critical exponents.\n2.  **Define the Expansion Parameter (ϵ):** The epsilon expansion is a perturbative approach in the small parameter `ϵ = d_c - d`. For our case, `d = 3`, so `ϵ = 4 - 3 = 1`.\n3.  **Use the Epsilon Expansion Formula for α:** The formula for the specific heat exponent α for the O(n) model, to the first order in ϵ, is:\n    `α = (4 - n) / (2 * (n + 8)) * ϵ`\n    For the Ising model, the order parameter has a single component, so we set `n = 1`.\n4.  **Calculate α:** We will substitute `n = 1` and `ϵ = 1` into the formula to find the value of α.\n\nThe following Python code implements this calculation, showing each step as requested.\n\n```python\nimport fractions\n\ndef calculate_alpha_exponent():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the specific heat scaling exponent alpha using the epsilon expansion.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Parameters for the calculation\n    d = 3      # Spatial dimension\n    d_c = 4    # Upper critical dimension for the Ising universality class\n    n = 1      # Number of components of the order parameter for the Ising model\n\n    # 1.
