    "My plan is to identify the specific movie scene the user is describing. The key elements are a major Hollywood film, a teenager, a pink bicycle, and the act of riding it directly toward an oncoming car. This distinctive scene is from a well-known 1980s horror film. I will provide a Python script to print the title of this movie.\n\n```python\ndef find_movie_with_pink_bike_scene():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the name of the Hollywood film\n    featuring a scene where a teenager on a pink bike confronts an oncoming car.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The film is the second installment in a famous horror franchise.\n    # The scene involves the character Grady riding his sister's pink bike\n    # in a game of \"chicken\" with another character's car.\n    movie_title = \"A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge\"\n    print(movie_title)\n\nfind_movie_with_pink_bike_scene()\n```\n<<<A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge>>>"
