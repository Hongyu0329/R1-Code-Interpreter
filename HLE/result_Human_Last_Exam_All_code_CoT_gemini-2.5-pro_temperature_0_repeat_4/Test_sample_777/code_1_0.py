# This problem asks for a complexity-theoretic analysis, not a direct coding solution.
# The user wants to know which statement about the complexity of the DisjointCycles problem is true.
#
# My analysis concluded the following:
# 1. The problem is Fixed-Parameter Tractable (FPT) on planar graphs.
#    - This is because planar graphs with large treewidth contain large grid subgraphs,
#      which in turn contain the desired k disjoint cycles of length at least k.
#    - If the treewidth is small (bounded by a function of k), dynamic programming can solve it in FPT time.
#
# 2. The problem is W[1]-complete on general graphs.
#    - The FPT argument based on treewidth fails for general graphs because large treewidth
#      only guarantees a grid *minor*, not a subgraph, which is not sufficient.
#    - The problem is related to other known W[1]-hard problems like finding k disjoint cycles
#      of length at least L (for fixed L), and a reduction from a canonical W[1]-complete
#      problem like Grid Tiling is plausible.
#
# This corresponds to answer choice B.

# The user wants me to provide a python block, so I will print the reasoning and the final answer.
