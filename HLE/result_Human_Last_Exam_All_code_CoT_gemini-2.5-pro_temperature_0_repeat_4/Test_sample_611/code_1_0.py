    Solves the probability problem about the Wiener sausage of a conditioned Brownian motion.

    The solution proceeds in the following steps:
    1.  The process X_t is a complex Brownian motion conditioned to never hit the unit disk D_0.
        This is a Doob's h-transform with h(z) = ln|z|.
    2.  We apply the transformation W_t = ln(X_t). This maps the domain C \\ D_0 to the
        right half-plane {w | Re(w) > 0}.
    3.  The process W_t, after a time change, has a generator L' = (1/2) * Delta + (1/u) * d/du,
        where w = u + iv.
    4.  The real part U'_t and imaginary part V'_t of this time-changed process are independent.
        - U'_t is a 3-dimensional Bessel process (BES(3)). Its range, starting from U'_0 > 0,
          is [U'_0, infinity) almost surely.
        - V'_t is a standard 1-dimensional Brownian motion. Its range is (-infinity, infinity)
          almost surely.
    5.  The trace of W_t is the same as W'_t, which is the product of the ranges of its
        independent components. So, the trace of W_t is the half-plane [ln|X_0|, infinity) x (-infinity, infinity).
    6.  Transforming back via X_t = exp(W_t), the trace of X_t is the set of all complex numbers
        outside the disk of radius |X_0|, i.e., X_[0,inf) = C \\ D(0, |X_0|).
    7.  The sausage is S = X_[0,inf) + D_0 = (C \\ D(0, |X_0|)) + D(0, 1) = C \\ D(0, |X_0| - 1).
        Since |X_0| > 1, the sausage covers the entire complex plane except for a disk of radius |X_0|-1 > 0.
    8.  The disks B_n = {z | |z-n| <= n/3} move out to infinity. For any fixed starting point X_0,
        there is an N such that for all n > N, the disk B_n is completely contained in the sausage S.
    9.  For n > N, the relative area V_n = |B_n intersect S| / |B_n| is equal to 1.
    10. Therefore, the limit of V_n as n -> infinity is 1.
    11. We need to find lim_{n->inf} P[V_n > 2/3]. Since V_n converges to 1, for any n large enough,
        V_n will be greater than 2/3. The probability of this event thus converges to 1.
