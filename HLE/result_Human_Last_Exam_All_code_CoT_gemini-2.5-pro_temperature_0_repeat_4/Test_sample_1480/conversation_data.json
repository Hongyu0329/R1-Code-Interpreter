    "To calculate the rule activation level of an interval type-3 fuzzy set, we need to combine the firing level of the rule's antecedent with the membership degree of the consequent. This combination is performed using a t-norm operation, which acts as a fuzzy logic AND operator.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  Identify the given values: The antecedent firing level `Phi_k(x′)` is 0.7, and the consequent membership degree `μG_k_j(y_j)` is 0.9.\n2.  Choose a t-norm: The problem specifies using \"a t-norm operation\". The most common and standard t-norm is the minimum operator, which I will use for this calculation.\n3.  Apply the t-norm: The rule activation level is the minimum of the antecedent firing level and the consequent membership degree.\n4.  Write a Python script to perform this calculation and print the result, showing the values used in the equation.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_rule_activation():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the rule activation level for a fuzzy set using a t-norm.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Given values\n    # Phi_k(x') is the firing level of the antecedent part of the rule.\n    phi_k_x_prime = 0.7\n    # μG_k_j(y_j) is the membership degree of the consequent part of the rule.\n    mu_G_k_j_y_j = 0.9\n\n    # A t-norm is used to combine the antecedent and consequent.\n    # The most common t-norm is the minimum operator.\n    activation_level = min(phi_k_x_prime, mu_G_k_j_y_j)\n\n    # Print the explanation and the final equation with the result\n    print(\"The rule activation level is calculated by applying a t-norm (minimum operator) to the antecedent firing level and the consequent membership degree.\")\n    print(f\"Activation Level = min(Phi_k(x'), μG_k_j(y_j))\")\n    print(f\"Activation Level = min({phi_k_x_prime}, {mu_G_k_j_y_j})\")\n    print(f\"The calculated rule activation level is: {activation_level}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    calculate_rule_activation()\n```\n<<<0.7>>>"
