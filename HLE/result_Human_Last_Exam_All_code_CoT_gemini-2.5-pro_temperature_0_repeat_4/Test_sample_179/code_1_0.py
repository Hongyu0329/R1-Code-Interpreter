# Define the given parameters from the problem statement

# The differential equation for X0(t) is X0'(t) = -(B + 1) * X0(t) + A.
# This can be rewritten as X0'(t) + (B + 1) * X0(t) = A.
# This is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation.

# Let's define the coefficients of the ODE:
# a = B + 1
# b = A
# The ODE is X0'(t) + a*X0(t) = b
a = B + 1
b = A

# The general solution to this ODE is X0(t) = (b/a) + C1 * exp(-a*t),
# where C1 is an integration constant.
# The term (b/a) is the particular solution, which is a constant value.
K = b / a

# Now, we use the boundary condition X0(0) - X0(T) = alpha1 to find C1.
# Since alpha1 = 0, the condition is X0(0) = X0(T).

# Let's express X0(0) and X0(T) using the general solution:
# X0(0) = K + C1 * exp(-a * 0) = K + C1
# X0(T) = K + C1 * exp(-a * T)

# Setting them equal:
# K + C1 = K + C1 * exp(-a * T)
# C1 = C1 * exp(-a * T)
# C1 * (1 - exp(-a * T)) = 0

# The term (1 - exp(-a*T)) is non-zero because a*T = (1e-5)*(1e20) = 1e15, which is positive.
# For the product to be zero, the constant C1 must be zero.
C1 = 0

# With C1 = 0, the solution for X0(t) simplifies to the constant particular solution.
# X0(t) = K
# Therefore, the value of X0(t) is constant for all t.
X0_at_T = K

# The final equation for the solution X0(t) is X0(t) = A / (B + 1)
final_A = A
final_B_plus_1 = B + 1
final_X0 = X0_at_T
