    "Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Integral:** The expression to be integrated is `F₃'(x)/F₃(x)`. This is a standard form `f'(x)/f(x)`, whose integral is `ln|f(x)|`. In our case, `f(x) = F₃(x)`.\n2.  **Evaluate the Definite Integral:** The definite integral from 0 to 1 is `[ln|F₃(x)|]` evaluated from 0 to 1. This gives `ln|F₃(1)| - ln|F₃(0)|`. We will show that `F₃(x)` is positive for `x` in `[0, 1]`, so the absolute value can be removed.\n3.  **Calculate `F₃(0)`:**\n    *   `F₀(0) = 0`\n    *   `F₁(0) = sin(0) = 0`\n    *   `F₂(0) = e⁰ = 1`\n    *   `F₃(0) = ln(1 + 1) = ln(2)`\n4.  **Calculate `F₃(1)`:**\n    *   `F₀(1) = 1`\n    *   `F₁(1) = sin(1)`\n    *   `F₂(1) = e^(sin(1))`\n    *   `F₃(1) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))`\n5.  **Compute the Value V:** The value of the integral is `V = ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0))`.\n6.  **Final Calculation:** I will write a Python script to compute the numerical value of `V`, multiply it by 10000, and round it to the nearest integer as requested. The script will also print the equation with the numerical values of `F₃(1)` and `F₃(0)`.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The integral of F₃'(x)/F₃(x) from 0 to 1 is V = ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0)).\n# We need to calculate F₃(0) and F₃(1) first.\n\n# Calculate F₃(0)\n# F₃(0) = ln(1 + e^(sin(0))) = ln(1 + e^0) = ln(2)\nF3_0 = math.log(2)\n\n# Calculate F₃(1)\n# F₃(1) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))\n# Note: math.sin() takes the angle in radians.\nF3_1 = math.log(1 + math.exp(math.sin(1)))\n\n# Calculate the value of the integral V\nV = math.log(F3_1) - math.log(F3_0)\n\n# Calculate the final result: the closest integer to 10000 * V\nfinal_result = round(10000 * V)\n\n# As requested, output the numbers in the final equation for V\nprint(\"The integral V is calculated as ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0)).\")\nprint(f\"F₃(0) = ln(2) ≈ {F3_0}\")\nprint(f\"F₃(1) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1))) ≈ {F3_1}\")\nprint(\"\\nThe final equation for V with these numbers is:\")\nprint(f\"V = ln({F3_1}) - ln({F3_0})\")\nprint(f\"V ≈ {V}\")\nprint(\"\\nThe value of 10000 * V is approximately:\")\nprint(10000 * V)\nprint(\"\\nThe closest integer to 10000 * V is:\")\nprint(final_result)\n\n```\n<<<5487>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant.
