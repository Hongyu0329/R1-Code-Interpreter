    "To determine what the Modern English word for \"sister\" would be without Norse influence, we need to trace the development of the original Old English word.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Identify the current word's origin:** The modern word \"sister\" comes from the Old Norse word \"systir,\" which was introduced during the Viking Age and eventually replaced the native English term.\n2.  **Find the native Old English word:** The original word for sister in Old English (the language of the Anglo-Saxons) was \"sweostor.\"\n3.  **Trace the linguistic evolution:** We will follow the known sound changes that occurred between Old English and Modern English. The word \"sweostor\" evolved into \"suster\" in Middle English. This form was common but ultimately lost out to the Norse-derived \"sister.\"\n4.  **Determine the modern form:** If \"suster\" had continued to evolve naturally into Modern English, it would have kept its spelling and its vowel would be pronounced like the 'u' in \"cup\" or \"duster.\"\n\nThe following Python code will print this explanation and the final resulting word.\n\n```python\ndef find_hypothetical_word():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains and prints the hypothetical Modern English word for \"sister\"\n    if the Norse had not influenced the English language.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"This script determines the hypothetical Modern English word for 'sister' without Norse influence.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 80)\n\n    # Step 1: Explain the origin of the current word \"sister\"\n    current_word = \"sister\"\n    origin_language = \"Old Norse\"\n    origin_word = \"systir\"\n    print(f\"1. The current English word, '{current_word}', is a loanword from {origin_language}.\")\n    print(f\"   It comes from the word '{origin_word}', which replaced the native term during the Viking Age.\")\n    print()\n\n    # Step 2: Identify the native Old English word\n    old_english_word = \"sweostor\"\n    print(f\"2. The original Old English (Anglo-Saxon) word was '{old_english_word}'.\")\n    print()\n\n    # Step 3: Trace the linguistic evolution\n    middle_english_word = \"suster\"\n    print(f\"3. Through normal sound changes, '{old_english_word}' became '{middle_english_word}' in Middle English.\")\n    print(f\"   This native form existed for centuries but was eventually outcompeted by '{current_word}'.\")\n    print()\n\n    # Step 4: Determine the final modern form\n    hypothetical_word = \"suster\"\n    print(f\"4. If the Norse word had never been introduced, '{middle_english_word}' would have continued into Modern English.\")\n    print(f\"   Its pronunciation would rhyme with 'duster' or 'muster'.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 80)\n    print(\"Therefore, the hypothetical Modern English word would be:\")\n    print(hypothetical_word)\n\nfind_hypothetical_word()\n```\n<<<suster>>>"
