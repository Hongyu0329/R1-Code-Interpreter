    """
    This function calculates the limit by analyzing the dominant case of the equation.
    
    The limit lim_{N->inf} p(N)/N is determined by the average number of solutions
    contributed per value of m. As explained in the text, for large m, the only
    case that contributes to the solution count is when the coefficients a, b, c, d, e, f are all zero.
    
    In this case, the equation simplifies to F_n + g = 0, or F_n = -g.
    We need to count the number of integer pairs (n, g) that satisfy this,
    given -25 <= g <= 25 and n >= 0. This is equivalent to counting the number of
    Fibonacci numbers F_n such that 0 <= F_n <= 25, accounting for multiplicity of n.
