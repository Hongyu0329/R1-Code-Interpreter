    "To determine the solubility of Al(OH)3 in pure water, we need to consider two simultaneous equilibria: the dissolution of Al(OH)3 and the formation of the hydroxo complex, Al(OH)4^-.\n\n**1. Chemical Reactions and Equilibrium Constants:**\n\n*   **Dissolution:** The solid Al(OH)3 dissolves to form aluminum ions (Al³⁺) and hydroxide ions (OH⁻).\n    `Al(OH)3(s) <=> Al³⁺(aq) + 3OH⁻(aq)`\n    The solubility product constant is `K_sp = [Al³⁺][OH⁻]³ = 5.3 * 10⁻²⁷`.\n\n*   **Complex Formation:** The dissolved aluminum ions react with hydroxide ions to form the tetrahydroxoaluminate(III) complex ion.\n    `Al³⁺(aq) + 4OH⁻(aq) <=> Al(OH)₄⁻(aq)`\n    The formation constant is `K_f = [Al(OH)₄⁻] / ([Al³⁺][OH⁻]⁴) = 1.1 * 10³¹`.\n\n*   **Overall Reaction for Complex Formation:** We can combine these two reactions to describe the dissolution of the solid directly into the complex ion.\n    `Al(OH)3(s) + OH⁻(aq) <=> Al(OH)₄⁻(aq)`\n    The equilibrium constant for this reaction, let's call it K_c, is the product of K_sp and K_f:\n    `K_c = K_sp * K_f = (5.3 * 10⁻²⁷) * (1.1 * 10³¹) = 5.83 * 10⁴`.\n    So, `K_c = [Al(OH)₄⁻] / [OH⁻]`.\n\n**2. Defining Solubility (S):**\n\nThe total solubility (S) is the sum of the concentrations of all dissolved aluminum-containing species in the solution.\n`S = [Al³⁺] + [Al(OH)₄⁻]`\n\n**3. Finding the Hydroxide Concentration [OH⁻]:**\n\nTo solve for S, we first need to find the equilibrium concentration of hydroxide ions, [OH⁻]. We can do this by using the charge balance equation for the solution: the sum of positive charges must equal the sum of negative charges.\n`3[Al³⁺] + [H⁺] = [OH⁻] + [Al(OH)₄⁻]`\n\nWe can express each term as a function of [OH⁻]:\n*   `[Al³⁺] = K_sp / [OH⁻]³`\n*   `[Al(OH)₄⁻] = K_c * [OH⁻]`\n*   `[H⁺] = K_w / [OH⁻]` (where K_w = 1.0 * 10⁻¹⁴ is the ion product of water)\n\nSubstituting these into the charge balance equation gives a polynomial equation for [OH⁻], which can be solved.\n\n**4. Calculation Plan:**\n\nThe following Python code will execute this plan:\n1.  Define the constants K_sp, K_f, and K_w.\n2.  Solve the charge balance equation to find the equilibrium [OH⁻]. This simplifies to solving a quadratic equation for `[OH⁻]²`.\n3.  Use the calculated [OH⁻] to find the concentrations of [Al³⁺] and [Al(OH)₄⁻].\n4.  Sum these concentrations to find the total solubility, S.\n5.  Print the final equation showing the sum of the species concentrations.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Known constants\nK_sp = 5.3e-27\nK_f = 1.1e31\nK_w = 1.0e-14\n\n# Calculate the combined equilibrium constant K_c\nK_c = K_sp * K_f\n\n# The charge balance equation leads to a quadratic equation for x = [OH-]^2:\n# (1 + K_c) * x^2 - K_w * x - 3 * K_sp = 0\n# where x = [OH-]^2\na = 1 + K_c\nb = -K_w\nc = -3 * K_sp\n\n# Solve the quadratic equation for x using the quadratic formula\n# x = [-b + sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)] / 2a (we take the positive root since concentration must be positive)\ndiscriminant = math.sqrt(b**2 - 4 * a * c)\nx = (-b + discriminant) / (2 * a)\n\n# Calculate [OH-]\nconc_OH = math.sqrt(x)\n\n# Calculate the concentrations of the dissolved aluminum species\nconc_Al3_plus = K_sp / (conc_OH**3)\nconc_Al_OH_4_minus = K_c * conc_OH\n\n# Calculate the total solubility S\nsolubility = conc_Al3_plus + conc_Al_OH_4_minus\n\n# Print the results\nprint(\"The solubility of Al(OH)3 is determined by the sum of the concentrations of the dissolved aluminum species: S = [Al^3+] + [Al(OH)4-].\")\nprint(f\"The equilibrium concentration of [Al^3+] is: {conc_Al3_plus:.3e} mol L^-1\")\nprint(f\"The equilibrium concentration of [Al(OH)4-] is: {conc_Al_OH_4_minus:.3e} mol L^-1\")\nprint(\"\\nThe final equation for solubility is:\")\nprint(f\"S = {conc_Al3_plus:.3e} mol L^-1 + {conc_Al_OH_4_minus:.3e} mol L^-1\")\nprint(f\"The total solubility of Al(OH)3 is: {solubility:.3e} mol L^-1\")\n\n# Final answer in the required format\nprint(f\"\\n<<<{solubility:.3e}>>>\")\n```"
