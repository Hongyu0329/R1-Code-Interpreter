    "My plan is to deduce the structure of the hydrocarbon by systematically analyzing the provided information.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Formula ($C_7H_{14}$):** I will first calculate the degree of unsaturation. This will tell me if the compound contains double bonds or rings. The general formula for an alkane is $C_nH_{2n+2}$. For n=7, this would be $C_7H_{16}$. The given formula has two fewer hydrogens, indicating one degree of unsaturation.\n\n2.  **Analyze the $^{13}C$ NMR Data:** I will interpret each signal:\n    *   **Chemical Shift (ppm):** The values of 145 and 112 ppm are in the typical range for alkene carbons (C=C), which confirms the degree of unsaturation is a double bond.\n    *   **Multiplicity (s, d, t, q):** This information (derived from a DEPT experiment) tells me the number of hydrogen atoms attached to each carbon (s=0H, d=1H, t=2H, q=3H). This allows me to identify the specific fragments, such as a `>C=` (quaternary, singlet) and a `=CH2` (triplet).\n\n3.  **Reconcile Carbon and Hydrogen Counts:** The molecular formula has 7 carbons, but there are only 6 NMR signals. This means two carbons in the molecule are chemically equivalent and produce a single overlapping signal. I will also sum the hydrogens indicated by the multiplicities and compare it to the 14 hydrogens in the formula to determine which signal is the overlapping one.\n\n4.  **Assemble the Structure:** Using the identified fragments (`>C=CH2`, and the remaining aliphatic carbons), I will piece together the only structure that is consistent with all the data. I will consider different isomers and rule them out if they don't match the observed NMR data (e.g., number of signals, multiplicities, or plausible chemical shifts).\n\n5.  **Assign Signals and Name the Compound:** Once the correct structure is determined, I will assign each NMR signal to its corresponding carbon in the molecule to confirm the fit. Finally, I will provide the official IUPAC name for the deduced structure.\n\n```python\ndef identify_hydrocarbon():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the provided molecular formula and 13C NMR data to determine the\n    IUPAC name of the hydrocarbon.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Starting analysis to identify the hydrocarbon with molecular formula C7H14.\")\n    \n    print(\"\\n--- Step 1: Analyze Molecular Formula ---\")\n    print(\"The molecular formula is C7H14.\")\n    print(\"For a saturated alkane with 7 carbons, the formula would be C7H(2*7+2) = C7H16.\")\n    print(\"The given formula has two fewer hydrogens, which indicates one degree of unsaturation (i.e., one double bond or one ring).\")\n\n    print(\"\\n--- Step 2: Analyze 13C NMR Data ---\")\n    print(\"The 13C NMR data is: 145(s), 112(t), 48(t), 27(d), 22(q), 21(q).\")\n    print(\"Multiplicity Key: (s) = singlet (0H), (t) = triplet (CH2), (d) = doublet (CH), (q) = quartet (CH3).\")\n    print(\"The signals at 145 ppm and 112 ppm are in the alkene region (100-150 ppm), confirming a C=C double bond.\")\n    print(\" - 145(s): A quaternary (0H) carbon in the double bond, >C=\")\n    print(\" - 112(t): A CH2 (2H) carbon in the double bond, =CH2\")\n    print(\"This combination points to a >C=CH2 structural unit.\")\n\n    print(\"\\n--- Step 3: Reconcile Carbon and Hydrogen Count ---\")\n    print(\"There are 6 NMR signals for 7 carbons, so one signal must represent two equivalent carbons.\")\n    print(\"Counting hydrogens from the 6 signals: 0 (from 145s) + 2 (from 112t) + 2 (from 48t) + 1 (from 27d) + 3 (from 22q) + 3 (from 21q) = 11 hydrogens.\")\n    print(\"The molecular formula requires 14 hydrogens.
