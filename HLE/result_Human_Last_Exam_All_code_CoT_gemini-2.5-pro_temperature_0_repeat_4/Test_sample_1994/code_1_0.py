# The number to represent
N = 10**100

# 1. Count the number of terms in the sequence.
# This is equivalent to the number of set bits (1s) in the binary
# representation of N. The bit_count() method efficiently calculates this.
count = N.bit_count()

# 2. Find the values of a1 and b1 for the largest multiplication in the sequence.
# The largest multiplication corresponds to the most significant bit (MSB) of N.
# First, we find the exponent 'k' of the MSB.
k = N.bit_length() - 1

# Now, we need to represent 2^k as tet(2, a1) * pow(2, b1).
# This means the exponent k is decomposed as k = 2**(a1 - 1) + b1,
# with the constraint that b1 < 2**(a1 - 1).

# To find a1, we find the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to k.
# The exponent of this power of 2 will be (a1 - 1).
# In other words, a1 - 1 = floor(log2(k)).
a1_minus_1 = k.bit_length() - 1
a1 = a1_minus_1 + 1

# b1 is the remainder of the exponent k after subtracting the tetration part.
# b1 = k - 2**(a1 - 1)
b1 = k - (1 << a1_minus_1)

# 3. Print the final result as requested.
# The output shows the count of sequences, followed by a1 and b1.
