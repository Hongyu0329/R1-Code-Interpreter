    "To find the smallest and largest possible rank of the Néron-Severi group of $X = C^{(15)}$, where $C$ is a genus 3 Riemann surface, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Relate the Rank of NS(X) to the Jacobian of C**: The variety $X = C^{(15)}$ is the 15th symmetric power of the curve $C$. For a curve of genus $g$ and its $d$-th symmetric power $C^{(d)}$, there is a key result when $d \\ge 2g - 1$. In this case, $C^{(d)}$ is a projective bundle over the Jacobian of the curve, $J(C)$. The rank of the Néron-Severi group (also known as the Picard number, $\\rho$) of a $\\mathbb{P}^n$-bundle over a base $B$ is $\\rho(B) + 1$.\n    *   Here, $g=3$ and $d=15$. The condition $d \\ge 2g - 1$ becomes $15 \\ge 2(3) - 1 = 5$, which is true.\n    *   Therefore, $\\rho(X) = \\rho(C^{(15)}) = \\rho(J(C)) + 1$.\n    *   Our problem is now reduced to finding the minimum and maximum possible values for $\\rho(J(C))$.\n\n2.  **Determine the Bounds for the Rank of NS(J(C))**: The Jacobian $J(C)$ is a principally polarized abelian variety of dimension $g=3$. The rank of the Néron-Severi group of an abelian variety $A$ of dimension $g$ is bounded by $1 \\le \\rho(A) \\le h^{1,1}(A)$, where $h^{1,1}(A)$ is a Hodge number. For an abelian variety of dimension $g$, $h^{1,1}(A) = g^2$.\n    *   For $J(C)$, this means $1 \\le \\rho(J(C)) \\le 3^2 = 9$.\n\n3.  **Find the Smallest Possible Rank**: The minimum value, $\\rho(J(C)) = 1$, is achieved for a \"very general\" curve $C$. In this case, the Néron-Severi group of its Jacobian is generated solely by the class of the principal polarization (the theta divisor).\n    *   Therefore, the minimum rank for $X$ is $\\rho(X)_{\\min} = \\rho(J(C))_{\\min} + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2$.\n\n4.  **Find the Largest Possible Rank**: The maximum value, $\\rho(J(C)) = 9$, is achieved for special curves whose Jacobians have complex multiplication (CM). It is a known result that such curves exist for genus 3 (a famous example is the Fermat quartic curve, $x^4+y^4=z^4$). For these curves, the Néron-Severi group is as large as possible.\n    *   Therefore, the largest rank for $X$ is $\\rho(X)_{\\max} = \\rho(J(C))_{\\max} + 1 = 9 + 1 = 10$.\n\nThe following Python code formalizes this reasoning and calculates the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_neron_severi_rank():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the smallest and largest possible rank of the Neron-Severi group\n    of the 15th symmetric power of a genus 3 Riemann surface.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the parameters from the problem statement\n    g = 3  # Genus of the Riemann surface C\n    d = 15 # Degree of the symmetric power X = C^(d)\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Check the condition for the projective bundle structure.\")\n    condition_value = 2 * g - 1\n    print(f\"The genus g is {g}, and the degree d is {d}.\")\n    print(f\"The condition is d >= 2*g - 1, which is {d} >= {condition_value}.\")\n    if d >= condition_value:\n        print(\"The condition holds.
