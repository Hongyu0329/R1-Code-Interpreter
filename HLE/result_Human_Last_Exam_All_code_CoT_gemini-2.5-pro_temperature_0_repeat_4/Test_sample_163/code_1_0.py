    # The clinical question is about the best follow-up after SFA stenting.
    # The key considerations are the type of test (ABI vs. Duplex) and the frequency.

    # 1. Choice of Test:
    # Arterial Duplex Ultrasound is the gold standard for post-intervention surveillance.
    # It can directly visualize the stent and measure blood flow velocities to detect
    # in-stent restenosis early, before it becomes hemodynamically significant
    # enough to lower the ABI or cause symptoms. ABI alone is not sensitive enough.
    # This eliminates options A and C.

    # 2. Frequency of Surveillance:
    # The risk of restenosis is highest in the first year. Therefore, surveillance
    # should be more frequent during this period. Annual surveillance (Option E) is too infrequent initially.
    # A standard schedule is at 3, 6, and 12 months.

    # 3. Evaluating the remaining options:
    # Option B (Duplex at 1, 3, 12 months) is reasonable but misses the 6-month mark.
    # Option D (Duplex at 3, 6, 12 months, and 2 years) provides a robust schedule
    # covering the most critical period (first year) and includes appropriate long-term follow-up.
    # This is the most comprehensive and standard approach.

        "The most appropriate surveillance program uses arterial duplex ultrasonography, "
        "as it is the most sensitive test for detecting in-stent restenosis. "

        "A schedule of follow-ups at 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months is standard. "
