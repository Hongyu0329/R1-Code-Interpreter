    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to identify \"X-Y\":\n\nFirst, I will analyze the key figure, Pavel Milyukov. He was a prominent Russian historian and liberal politician, a leader of the Constitutional Democratic (Kadet) Party. While he was a \"Westernizer\" who advocated for Russia to adopt a Western-style constitutional monarchy, he held more conservative views on culture and art.\n\nSecond, I will investigate his cultural critiques. His criticism was not aimed at Western culture as a whole, but at specific artistic and literary movements of the late 19th and early 20th centuries that he considered to be in decline or decay. The phrase \"stagnant swamp\" is a strong metaphor for such a view.\n\nThird, I will identify the specific two-word term (X-Y) that Milyukov and other critics of his time used to label these movements. This term encapsulates the fusion of two major artistic trends he opposed.\n\nFinally, I will write a simple Python script to present the answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_milyukov_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the term Pavel Milyukov used to denounce\n    certain cultural movements of his time.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Pavel Milyukov was a cultural conservative who was highly critical of\n    # modernism in art and literature. He saw these movements as a sign of\n    # decay and irrationality, a departure from the classical traditions he valued.\n    \n    # The term \"X-Y\" refers to the label he and other critics applied to\n    # these interconnected artistic and literary schools.\n    \n    x = \"Symbolist\"\n    y = \"Decadents\"\n    \n    print(f\"The term X-Y, which Pavel Milyukov denounced as a 'stagnant swamp', stands for: {x}-{y}\")\n\nsolve_milyukov_riddle()\n```\n<<<Symbolist-Decadents>>>"
