    Counts k-matchings in a graph using a brute-force approach.
    
    A k-matching is a set of k edges with no shared vertices. This function
    demonstrates the problem by iterating through all combinations of k edges
    and checking if they form a matching.

    Note: This algorithm is simple but inefficient. Its time complexity is
    O(|E|^k * k), where |E| is the number of edges. For dense graphs, this is
    O(n^(2k)), which is not subcubic for k >= 2. The state-of-the-art algorithms
    for small k are much faster but significantly more complex.
    
    Args:
        graph_edges (list of tuples): The list of edges in the graph.
        k (int): The size of the matching to count.

    Returns:
        int: The number of k-matchings in the graph.

    #    4-matchings requires at least cubic time. This is due to a known reduction
    #    from APSP to counting 4-matchings. Therefore, k must be less than 4.
