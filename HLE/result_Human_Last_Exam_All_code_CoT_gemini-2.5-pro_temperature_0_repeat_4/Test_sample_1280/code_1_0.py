    This function determines the maximum number of differing energy levels
    between two partner Hamiltonians in supersymmetric quantum mechanics.

    The reasoning is as follows:
    1. The spectra of the two partner Hamiltonians, H_0 and H_1, are related
       by a supersymmetry transformation.
    2. This transformation maps every energy level of H_0 to a level with the
       same energy in H_1, and vice-versa.
    3. The mapping can fail for a special energy level, E = -alpha, if there
       exists a state annihilated by the operators L or L+.
    4. For the given first-order operators, there can be at most one such
       unpaired state for H_0 and at most one for H_1.
    5. Therefore, the set of energy levels for H_0 and H_1 can differ by at
       most one element (the value -alpha).
    6. The maximum number of differing levels is thus 1.
