def solve_five_points_problem():
    """
    Calculates the largest real number r based on the geometric configuration.

    The problem is to find the largest r such that there is a configuration of 5 points
    in a unit square with no monochromatic triangles, where edges are colored
    based on their length being < r or >= r. This is related to the Ramsey number
    R(3,3)=6, and the distance graph must be a 5-cycle.

    The optimal configuration leads to a value of r derived from the geometry of
    placing a specific 5-point set (a pentastar) in the square.
    The value r is given by the expression: sqrt(2 - 2*sqrt(5)/5).
