    "Of course. Here is my plan to solve this problem, followed by the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Identify the Theory and Diagrams:** The problem is set in $\\phi^4$ scalar field theory. The interaction vertex involves four fields ($\\phi^4$). We are looking for second-order diagrams, which means diagrams with two such vertices. These are \"vacuum bubble\" diagrams, meaning they have no external lines. All lines are internal propagators.\n\n2.  **Topological Classification:** I will identify all possible ways to connect the 8 \"legs\" (4 from each of the two vertices) to form valid diagrams. This analysis reveals three distinct topologies:\n    *   **Diagram 1 (The \"Lantern\"):** The two vertices are connected to each other by all four propagators.\n    *   **Diagram 2 (The \"Dumbbell\"):** Each vertex has a self-loop (a \"tadpole\"), and the two vertices are connected by two propagators.\n    *   **Diagram 3 (The \"Disconnected Figure-Eights\"):** This is a disconnected diagram consisting of two separate first-order vacuum bubbles. Each component has one vertex and two self-loops.\n\n3.  **Calculate Individual Symmetry Factors (S):** The symmetry factor of a Feynman diagram is the order of its automorphism group, which counts the number of permutations of vertices and propagators that leave the diagram's structure unchanged. I will calculate this for each of the three diagrams.\n    *   **For the Lantern Diagram ($S_1$):** The calculation involves the permutations of the two identical vertices and the four identical propagators connecting them.\n    *   **For the Dumbbell Diagram ($S_2$):** The calculation involves permutations of the two vertices, the two propagators connecting them, and the \"flipping\" of the lines within each self-loop.\n    *   **For the Disconnected Diagram ($S_3$):** The calculation is done in two steps. First, I'll find the symmetry factor of a single \"figure-eight\" component. Then, for the full diagram with two such identical components, the total symmetry factor is the product of the individual factors multiplied by the factorial of the number of identical components (2!).\n\n4.  **Sum the Factors:** Finally, I will sum the symmetry factors of the three distinct diagrams to get the total value as requested.\n\n5.  **Implement in Python:** I will write a Python script to perform these calculations. The script will clearly define the factors for each diagram, compute the individual symmetry factors, and then compute the final sum. The output will explicitly show the numbers for each part of the calculation and the final summation equation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_and_print_symmetry_factors():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the symmetry factors for all second-order vacuum bubble diagrams\n    in phi^4 theory and prints the sum.\n    \"\"\"\n    # In phi^4 theory, second-order vacuum diagrams have 2 vertices.\n    # Each vertex has 4 lines.
