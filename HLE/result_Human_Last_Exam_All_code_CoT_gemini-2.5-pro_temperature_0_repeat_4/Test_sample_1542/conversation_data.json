    "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of equivalence classes of quadratic forms in two variables over the ring $R = \\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Define Quadratic Forms**: A quadratic form in two variables over $R$ is a polynomial $Q(x, y) = ax^2 + bxy + cy^2$, where the coefficients $a, b, c$ are in $R = \\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$. Since each coefficient can take 8 values, there are $8 \\times 8 \\times 8 = 512$ distinct quadratic forms.\n\n2.  **Define Equivalence**: Two quadratic forms, $Q_1$ and $Q_2$, are considered equivalent if there exists an invertible linear transformation $T$ such that $Q_2(v) = Q_1(T(v))$ for all vectors $v = (x, y)$ in $R^2$. Such a transformation $T$ can be represented by a 2x2 matrix $P$ with entries in $R$. The transformation is invertible if and only if the determinant of $P$, $\\det(P)$, is a unit in $R$. The units in $\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$ are the odd numbers: $\\{1, 3, 5, 7\\}$. The set of all such invertible matrices forms the group $GL_2(\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z})$.\n\n3.  **Group Action**: The group $GL_2(\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z})$ acts on the set of 512 quadratic forms. The number of equivalence classes is the number of orbits of this group action.\n\n4.  **Computational Approach**: We can determine the number of orbits by a direct computational search. The algorithm is as follows:\n    a. Create a set containing all 512 quadratic forms, each represented by a tuple of its coefficients $(a, b, c)$.\n    b. Generate all invertible 2x2 matrices over $\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$ to get the group $GL_2(\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z})$.\n    c. Initialize a class counter to zero.\n    d. Loop until the set of forms is empty:\n        i. Increment the class counter.\n        ii. Pick an arbitrary form from the set to be the representative of a new class.\n        iii. Calculate all forms equivalent to this representative by applying every transformation matrix from $GL_2(\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z})$. This set of equivalent forms is the orbit of the representative.\n        iv. Remove all forms in this orbit from the main set of forms.\n    e. The final value of the counter is the number of equivalence classes.\n\n5.  **Output**: The code will implement this algorithm. To satisfy the request to \"output each number in the final equation\", the code will also calculate the size of each orbit. The sum of the sizes of all orbits must equal the total number of forms, 512. The code will print this sum, showing how the set of all forms is partitioned into these equivalence classes.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to find the number of classes.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef count_quadratic_form_classes():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of equivalence classes of quadratic forms in two\n    variables over the ring Z/8Z.\n\n    The method is to perform a brute-force orbit enumeration.\n    1. Generate all 512 quadratic forms ax^2 + bxy + cy^2.\n    2. Generate all invertible 2x2 matrices over Z/8Z, which form the group GL(2, Z/8Z).\n    3.
