def solve_attack_graph_question():
    """
    This function identifies and prints the incorrect statements about
    State Enumeration Graphs (SEG) and Logical Attack Graphs (LAG).

    The analysis of each statement is as follows:
    A. Correct. Generating both graph types is exponential in the worst case.
    B. Correct. SEGs are more expressive and can represent non-monotonic paths that LAGs cannot.
    C. Incorrect. The primary reason for the size difference is the abstraction from states to facts, not the monotonicity assumption itself, which is an enabler for that abstraction.
    D. Incorrect. This is an overly strong claim. While difficult, probabilities in cyclic graphs can be calculated or approximated using advanced methods like Dynamic Bayesian Networks or simulation.
    E. Correct. Standard LAGs struggle with negation due to the monotonicity assumption, whereas SEGs can handle it easily.

    The incorrect statements are C and D.
