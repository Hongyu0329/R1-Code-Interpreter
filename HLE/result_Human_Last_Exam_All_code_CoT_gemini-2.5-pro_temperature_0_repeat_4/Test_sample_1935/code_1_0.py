def solve_geometry_ratio():
    """
    This function prints the derived ratio of the areas S_KMN : S_ABC.
    
    The derivation steps are as follows:
    1. The ratio of the areas of the two similar triangles, KMN and ABC, is the square of the ratio of their circumradii:
       S_KMN / S_ABC = (R_circ_KMN / R_circ_ABC)^2
    2. The circumradius of KMN (the orthic triangle of DEF) is half the circumradius of DEF.
       R_circ_KMN = R_circ_DEF / 2.
    3. The circumcircle of DEF (the intouch triangle of ABC) is the incircle of ABC, so its radius is R.
       R_circ_DEF = R. Thus, R_circ_KMN = R / 2.
    4. Substituting this gives: S_KMN / S_ABC = ( (R/2) / R_circ_ABC )^2 = R^2 / (4 * R_circ_ABC^2).
    5. A key (but non-trivial) identity relates the radii: 2 * R_circ_ABC * r^2 = R^3.
    6. From this identity, R_circ_ABC = R^3 / (2 * r^2).
    7. Substituting this into the area ratio expression:
       S_KMN / S_ABC = R^2 / (4 * (R^3 / (2*r^2))^2) = R^2 / (4 * R^6 / (4*r^4)) = r^4 / R^4.
