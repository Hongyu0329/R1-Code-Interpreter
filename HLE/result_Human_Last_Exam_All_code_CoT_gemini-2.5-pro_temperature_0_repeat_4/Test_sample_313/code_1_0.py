# This script prints the solution to the language identification puzzle.

# Language a: Identified as Scottish Gaelic.
# Clues: No 'k' or 'w' in its native orthography, contains 'Ã ', and is a recognized minority language.
# Scottish Gaelic fits these clues more strictly than other candidates like Italian because it
# systematically respells loanwords to fit its own alphabet.
language_a = "Scottish Gaelic"

# Language b: Identified as Norwegian.
# Clues: The letter combinations "ggj" and "skt" are very widely used.
# These combinations are characteristic of West Scandinavian languages.
# "ggj" is found in common verbs (e.g., 'byggja' - to build).
# "skt" is a very common adjectival ending (e.g., 'norskt' - Norwegian).
language_b = "Norwegian"
