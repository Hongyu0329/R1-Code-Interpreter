  Analyzes the given mathematical statements about the set L = {(x,y) in R^2 : y = |x|}.
  
  The analysis of each statement is as follows:
  A. True. L is the image of a smooth immersion from the disjoint union of two copies of [0, infinity).
  B. True. A smooth curve parametrizing L can be constructed, e.g., using bump functions.
  C. False. A manifold has a single, well-defined dimension. It cannot be diffeomorphic to S^n for all n.
  D. True. L is homeomorphic to R, and can thus be given the Lie group structure of (R, +).
  E. True. The origin (0,0) is the unique point whose removal results in a smooth manifold.
  
  The false statement is C.
