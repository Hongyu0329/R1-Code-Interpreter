    # Choice C: Septic Arthritis
    print("\nDiagnosis: Septic Arthritis")
    print("Evaluation: Unlikely. Septic arthritis is a joint infection. A synovial fluid analysis would show a very high white blood cell count and likely organisms on gram stain. This patient's fluid had no white blood cells or organisms.")

    # Choice E: Pseudogout (and by extension, Gout)
    print("\nDiagnosis: Pseudogout / Gout")
    print("Evaluation: Unlikely. These are crystal-induced arthropathies. The diagnosis requires finding crystals in the synovial fluid. This patient's fluid had no crystals. Furthermore, these conditions typically respond well to steroids, but this patient's symptoms worsened.")

    # Choice A: Osteoarthritis
    print("\nDiagnosis: Osteoarthritis")
    print("Evaluation: Less likely. While the patient's age is a risk factor, the acute, intensely inflammatory presentation (erythema) and negative X-rays are not typical. The complete failure of anti-inflammatory treatment also argues against this.")
    
    # Choice D: Chronic osteomyelitis
    print("\nDiagnosis: Chronic osteomyelitis")
    print("Evaluation: Unlikely. This is a bone infection. It would likely cause an inflammatory reaction in the adjacent joint, leading to elevated white blood cells in the synovial fluid, which was not seen. X-rays would also likely show bony changes over time.")

    # Choice B: Charcot Arthropathy
    print("\nDiagnosis: Charcot Arthropathy")
    print("Evaluation: Most likely. This condition results from nerve damage (neuropathy) leading to joint destruction. The acute phase classically presents with a red, hot, swollen joint, mimicking infection. Key features that match this case are:")
    print("  - Early X-rays are often normal.")
    print("  - It does NOT respond to anti-inflammatory medications like NSAIDs or steroids.")
    print("  - The synovial fluid is characteristically non-inflammatory (no/low white blood cells), which is the most definitive clue in this case.")

    # --- Step 3: State the final conclusion ---
    print("\n--- Conclusion ---")
    print("The combination of an acute, swollen, red joint with non-inflammatory synovial fluid and a failure to respond to anti-inflammatory treatment is classic for Charcot Arthropathy.")
