    "In the path integral formalism for fermionic systems, the Pauli exclusion principle is fundamentally encoded by using anti-commuting numbers known as Grassmann variables. For any two Grassmann variables, `η₁` and `η₂`, their product anti-commutes: `η₁η₂ = -η₂η₁`. A direct consequence of this is that the square of any single Grassmann variable is zero: `η² = 0`. This mathematical property directly mirrors the physical principle that a quantum state cannot be occupied by two identical fermions.\n\nThe \"measure\" for an integral over a Grassmann variable `η`, denoted `dη`, is not a value in the traditional sense but is defined by the rules of Berezin integration. These rules are:\n\n1.  `∫ dη = 0`\n2.  `∫ η dη = 1`\n\nThe integral acts more like a differentiation than a traditional integration. The \"value\" of the measure that the question refers to is the normalization condition that makes these integrals well-defined and consistent. This is the second rule: the integral of the Grassmann variable itself is defined to be 1. This normalization is a cornerstone of the formalism.\n\nThe following Python script symbolically demonstrates this fundamental rule. It defines a simple class to represent expressions involving a single Grassmann variable and an integration function that follows the Berezin rules. It then computes `∫ η dη` to show it equals 1.\n\n```python\n# A simple class to represent a Grassmann expression of the form: c0 + c1*η\nclass GrassmannExpr:\n    \"\"\"\n    Represents a simple polynomial in a single Grassmann variable η.\n    Since η^2 = 0, any expression can be written as c0 + c1*η.\n    \"\"\"\n    def __init__(self, c0, c1):\n        # c0 is the constant part, c1 is the coefficient of η\n        self.c0 = c0\n        self.c1 = c1\n\n    def __repr__(self):\n        # A user-friendly string representation of the expression\n        if self.c0 == 0 and self.c1 == 0:\n            return \"0\"\n        \n        parts = []\n        if self.c0 != 0:\n            parts.append(str(self.c0))\n        \n        if self.c1 != 0:\n            if self.c1 == 1:\n                # Avoid printing 1η, just print η\n                parts.append(\"η\")\n            elif self.c1 == -1:\n                # Avoid printing + -1η, just print - η\n                parts.append(\"-η\")\n            else:\n                # Format the coefficient with the variable\n                parts.append(f\"{self.c1}η\")\n        \n        # Join the parts with a plus sign and clean up formatting\n        return \" + \".join(parts).replace(\" + -\", \" - \")\n\ndef berezin_integral(expr):\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies the Berezin integration rules for a single variable:\n    ∫ dη = 0\n    ∫ η dη = 1\n    This means the integral of an expression (c0 + c1*η) is simply c1.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The integral \"picks out\" the coefficient of η\n    return expr.c1\n\n# --- Main Demonstration ---\n\n# Represent the Grassmann variable η itself.\n# In our class notation, η is equivalent to the expression 0 + 1*η.\neta_variable = GrassmannExpr(c0=0, c1=1)\n\n# Perform the integral ∫ η dη using our defined function.\n# The function berezin_integral(eta_variable) will return the coefficient of η, which is 1.\nresult = berezin_integral(eta_variable)\n\n# Print the final equation as requested.\n# The integral symbol ∫ is represented by 'Integral'.\n# The measure dη is implied by the integration function.\nprint(\"The defining normalization for the Grassmann integral measure is:\")\nprint(f\"Integral( {eta_variable} dη ) = {result}\")\n\n```\n<<<1>>>"
