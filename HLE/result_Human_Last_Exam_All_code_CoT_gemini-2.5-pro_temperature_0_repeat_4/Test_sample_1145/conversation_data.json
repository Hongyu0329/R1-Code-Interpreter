    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of finding the particle in a specific interval within the 1D box. This is done by integrating the probability density function, `|ψ(x)|²`, over that interval.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **State the Formula:** The probability `P` is the integral of the probability density function `|ψ_n(x)|²` from `x1` to `x2`. The wave function for a particle in a 1D box is `ψ_n(x) = sqrt(2/a) * sin(n*π*x/a)`. Therefore, the probability density is `|ψ_n(x)|² = (2/a) * sin²(n*π*x/a)`.\n2.  **Identify the Parameters:** From the problem statement, we have:\n    *   Quantum state `n = 2`.\n    *   The interval is from `x1 = 0.495a` to `x2 = 0.505a`.\n3.  **Set up the Integral:** The probability `P` is given by the definite integral:\n    `P = ∫[from 0.495a to 0.505a] (2/a) * sin²(2*π*x/a) dx`\n4.  **Calculate the Integral:** We can solve this integral numerically using Python. The result is independent of the box length 'a', so we can set `a=1` for the calculation. The Python code will use the `scipy.integrate.quad` function to perform this numerical integration.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to find the probability.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.integrate import quad\n\n# 1. Define the parameters from the problem statement.\nn = 2\n# The length of the box 'a' cancels out in the final probability calculation,\n# so we can set a=1.0 for simplicity.\na = 1.0\nx1 = 0.495 * a\nx2 = 0.505 * a\n\n# 2. Define the probability density function, |ψ(x)|².\ndef probability_density(x, n_val, a_val):\n    \"\"\"\n    Probability density function |ψ_n(x)|² for a particle in a 1D box.\n    \"\"\"\n    return (2.0 / a_val) * (np.sin(n_val * np.pi * x / a_val))**2\n\n# 3. Calculate the probability by integrating the probability density function\n# from x1 to x2 using scipy.integrate.quad.\nprobability, error = quad(probability_density, x1, x2, args=(n, a))\n\n# 4. Print the final equation with all the numbers and the result.\nprint(\"The probability P is found by integrating the probability density function |ψ_n(x)|² over the interval.\")\nprint(\"The final equation to solve is:\")\nprint(f\"P = ∫ from x1={x1:.3f}a to x2={x2:.3f}a of (2/a) * sin²({n}*π*x/a) dx\")\nprint(\"\\nThe result of this integral is:\")\nprint(f\"{probability}\")\n```\n<<<6.579739561514222e-06>>>"
