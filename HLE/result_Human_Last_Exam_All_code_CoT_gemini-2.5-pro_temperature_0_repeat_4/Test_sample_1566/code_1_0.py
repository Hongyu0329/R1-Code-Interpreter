    This function provides the solution to the topological problem.

    The problem asks for the number of topologically distinct continua with two properties:
    1. More than one and finitely many "end points".
    2. Exactly two orbits under auto-homeomorphisms.

    The step-by-step reasoning leads to the following conclusion:
    - The space must be composed of two orbits: the set of end points (E) and the set of non-end points (I).
    - The set of non-end points (I) must be a homogeneous 1-dimensional manifold.
    - This leaves two possibilities for I: a circle or an open interval.
    - It cannot be a circle, as that would leave no end points.
    - It must be an open interval. The compactification of an open interval by adding its two boundary points is an arc.
    - An arc perfectly fits the two properties: it has two end points ({0, 1}) which form one orbit, and its interior ((0, 1)) forms the second orbit.
    - Any continuum satisfying the properties must be homeomorphic to an arc.

    Therefore, there is only one such topologically distinct continuum.
