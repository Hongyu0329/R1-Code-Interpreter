    "To find the minimum number of vertices in a two-loop Feynman diagram, we can use the topological relations that govern these diagrams.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  Start with the two fundamental formulas for a connected Feynman diagram:\n    *   The formula relating the number of loops (L), internal lines (I), and vertices (V): `L = I - V + 1`\n    *   The formula relating the number of vertices (V), lines per vertex (n), internal lines (I), and external lines (E): `n * V = 2 * I + E`\n2.  We are given that the diagram has two loops, so `L = 2`.\n3.  We will combine these two equations to derive a single formula for the number of vertices (V) in terms of `n` and `E`.\n4.  To find the *minimum* number of vertices, we will analyze this formula. We need to choose the number of external lines (E) and the type of interaction (n) to make V as small as possible, while ensuring V is a positive integer.\n5.  The number of external lines `E` must be a non-negative integer (`E >= 0`). The simplest diagrams have `E=0` (vacuum diagrams) or `E=2` (propagator corrections).\n6.  The number of lines per vertex `n` must be at least 3 for an interaction to occur (`n >= 3`).\n7.  By finding the combination of `E` and `n` that results in the smallest integer `V`, we will find our answer. The code will perform this analysis and print the final calculation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_and_explain():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the step-by-step derivation to find the minimum\n    number of vertices in a two-loop Feynman diagram and prints the final result.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: State the problem and the fundamental equations.\n    print(\"The task is to find the minimum number of vertices (V) in a two-loop (L=2) Feynman diagram.\")\n    print(\"We use two key topological relations for a connected Feynman graph:\")\n    print(\"  1) L = I - V + 1\")\n    print(\"  2) n * V = 2 * I + E\")\n    print(\"Where L=loops, I=internal lines, V=vertices, E=external lines, and n=lines per vertex (e.g., n=4 for a phi^4 theory).\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Combine the equations.\n    L = 2\n    print(f\"Given L={L}, we can express the number of internal lines (I) from the first equation:\")\n    print(f\"{L} = I - V + 1  =>  I = V + 1\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Substituting I = V + 1 into the second equation:\")\n    print(\"n * V = 2 * (V + 1) + E\")\n    print(\"n * V = 2*V + 2 + E\")\n    print(\"V * (n - 2) = 2 + E\")\n    print(\"Solving for V, we get the general formula:\")\n    print(\"V = (2 + E) / (n - 2)\\n\")\n\n    # Step 3: Minimize V.\n    print(\"To find the minimum integer V > 0, we must choose valid integer values for E and n.\")\n    print(\"  - The number of external lines E must be >= 0.\")\n    print(\"  - The number of lines per vertex n must be >= 3 for an interaction to occur.\")\n    print(\"To minimize V, we should minimize the numerator (2 + E) and maximize the denominator (n - 2).\")\n    print(\"The minimum value for E is 0 (a vacuum diagram).\\n\")\n\n    # Step 4: Calculate V with the minimal E.\n    E = 0\n    print(f\"Setting E = {E}, the equation becomes: V = 2 / (n - 2)\\n\")\n\n    print(\"For V to be a positive integer, (n - 2) must be a positive divisor of 2.
