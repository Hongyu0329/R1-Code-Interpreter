# This script simulates the measurement of the cost of gene flow in yeast.
# We will calculate the selection coefficient (s) for hybrid generations
# compared to a non-hybrid parental line.

# Step 1: Define hypothetical fitness values.
# Fitness is a measure of reproductive success. We normalize the parent's fitness to 1.
# A value > 1 indicates higher fitness (hybrid vigor), < 1 indicates lower fitness (outbreeding depression).
