    "Of course. Here is a plan to scan the provided Latin line, followed by the Python code to display the result.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the Line and Meter:** The line \"et tibi bene esse soli quom sibi sit male\" is from the Roman playwright Plautus. The meter is an **iambic senarius**, which consists of six iambic (`S L`) feet. This meter allows for common substitutions, such as a spondee (`L L`) or a trochee (`L S`).\n2.  **Handle Elisions:** The line has 15 syllables, but an iambic senarius typically has 12. To fit the meter, we must apply elisions, where a final vowel is dropped before a word starting with a vowel. In this line, three elisions occur:\n    *   `tib(i) bene` -> `tib' bene`\n    *   `ben(e) esse` -> `ben' esse`\n    *   `sol(i) quom` -> `sol' quom`\n    The line effectively becomes: `et tib' ben' esse sol' quom sibi sit male`.\n3.  **Determine Syllable Quantities:** I will analyze each of the 12 resulting syllables to determine if it is long (L) or short (S) based on Latin pronunciation rules (vowel length and position relative to consonants).\n4.  **Group into Feet:** I will group the syllables into six metrical feet and present the final scansion with spaces separating each foot.\n\n*   **Foot 1:** `et tib'` -> `L S` (Trochee)\n*   **Foot 2:** `ben' es-` -> `S L` (Iamb)\n*   **Foot 3:** `-se sol'` -> `L L` (Spondee)\n*   **Foot 4:** `quom si-` -> `L S` (Trochee)\n*   **Foot 5:** `-bi sit` -> `L L` (Spondee)\n*   **Foot 6:** `ma-le` -> `S S` (Pyrrhic)\n\nThis combination of feet is a valid iambic senarius with accepted substitutions.\n\n```python\ndef scan_latin_line():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function prints the scansion of the Latin line:\n    \"et tibi bene esse soli quom sibi sit male\"\n    L = Long syllable\n    S = Short syllable\n    Feet are separated by two spaces.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The scansion is determined by analyzing the meter (iambic senarius),\n    # applying elisions, and determining syllable quantity.\n    # Feet: (L S) (S L) (L L) (L S) (L L) (S S)\n    scansion = \"L S  S L  L L  L S  L L  S S\"\n    print(scansion)\n\nscan_latin_line()\n```\n<<<L S  S L  L L  L S  L L  S S>>>"
