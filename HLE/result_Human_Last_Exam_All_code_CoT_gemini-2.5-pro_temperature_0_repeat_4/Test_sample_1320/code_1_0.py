    # Step 1 & 2: Identify the pattern for helix size 'm' in alternating alpha/omega-peptides.

    # alpha/beta-peptides -> 14-helix
    # alpha/gamma-peptides -> 16-helix
    # alpha/delta-peptides -> 18-helix

    # Step 3: Establish a formula for 'm' based on the number of CH2 groups ('n') in the omega-amino acid.
    # Number of CH2 groups in the backbone (-NH-(CH2)n-CO-):
