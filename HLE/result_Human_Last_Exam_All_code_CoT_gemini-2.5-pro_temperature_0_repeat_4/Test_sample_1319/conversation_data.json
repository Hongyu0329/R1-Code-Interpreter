    "Here is a plan to determine the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the Iliad, after Mount Olympus:\n\n1.  **Identify Mountains:** First, I will compile a list of historical mountains that are mentioned in the Iliad.\n2.  **Gather Elevation Data:** For each mountain on the list, I will find its official elevation in meters.\n3.  **Filter and Compare:** I will create a data structure (a dictionary) in Python to hold the mountain names and their elevations. I will then programmatically remove Mount Olympus from consideration.\n4.  **Find the Maximum:** From the remaining mountains, I will identify the one with the highest elevation.\n5.  **Output the Result:** The script will print the name of the tallest mountain and its elevation.\n\n```python\ndef find_tallest_mountain_in_iliad():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the Iliad,\n    after Mount Olympus, and prints the result.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Data of mountains mentioned in the Iliad and their elevations in meters.\n    # Source: Encyclopedia Britannica, Wikipedia, and other geographical sources.\n    mountains = {\n        \"Mount Olympus\": 2918,\n        \"Mount Parnassus\": 2457,\n        \"Mount Tmolus\": 2157,\n        \"Mount Athos\": 2033,\n        \"Mount Ossa\": 1978,\n        \"Mount Ida (Turkey)\": 1774,\n        \"Mount Pelion\": 1624,\n        \"Mount Samothrace\": 1611,\n    }\n\n    # The problem asks for the tallest mountain *after* Mount Olympus.\n    # So, we remove it from our dictionary before comparison.\n    if \"Mount Olympus\" in mountains:\n        del mountains[\"Mount Olympus\"]\n\n    # Find the mountain with the highest elevation from the remaining list.\n    # The max() function with a key lambda function is perfect for finding the\n    # key in a dictionary corresponding to the maximum value.\n    tallest_mountain_name = max(mountains, key=mountains.get)\n    tallest_mountain_height = mountains[tallest_mountain_name]\n\n    print(f\"After Mount Olympus, the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the Iliad is {tallest_mountain_name}.\")\n    print(f\"It has an elevation of {tallest_mountain_height} meters.\")\n\nfind_tallest_mountain_in_iliad()\n```\n<<<Mount Parnassus>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    After Mount Olympus, what is the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the Iliad?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
