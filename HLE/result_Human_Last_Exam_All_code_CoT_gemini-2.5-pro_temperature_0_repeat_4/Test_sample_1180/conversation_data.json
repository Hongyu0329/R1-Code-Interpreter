    "To solve this problem, we need to find the stable reduction of the given hyperelliptic curve and then determine the thickness of the double point in its special fiber. The thickness can be calculated using the valuations of the roots of the polynomial defining the curve.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Curve and Model:** The curve is given by $C: z^2 = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1$. This is a model over $\\mathbb{Z}$. To analyze its reduction at prime 2, we work over the 2-adic integers $\\mathbb{Z}_2$. The valuation $v$ is the standard 2-adic valuation, normalized so that $v(2)=1$.\n\n2.  **Monic Model:** The calculations are simpler if the polynomial is monic. We can achieve this by a change of variables. Let $x = y/2$. Substituting this into the equation gives:\n    $z^2 = 2(y/2)^5 + 2(y/2)^3 + 1 = \\frac{y^5}{16} + \\frac{y^3}{4} + 1$.\n    To clear the denominators and obtain an equation over $\\mathbb{Z}_2$, we multiply by 16:\n    $16z^2 = y^5 + 4y^3 + 16$.\n    Let $Z = 4z$. The equation becomes $Z^2 = y^5 + 4y^3 + 16$. This gives a new model for the curve, defined by the monic polynomial $f(y) = y^5 + 4y^3 + 16$.\n\n3.  **Newton Polygon and Root Valuations:** The stable reduction is determined by the clustering of the roots of $f(y)$ in the algebraic closure of $\\mathbb{Q}_2$. The 2-adic valuations of these roots can be found from the Newton polygon of $f(y)$. The Newton polygon is constructed from the points $(i, v(a_i))$, where $a_i$ is the coefficient of $y^i$ in $f(y)$.\n    The coefficients of $f(y) = y^5 + 4y^3 + 16$ are $a_5=1, a_4=0, a_3=4, a_2=0, a_1=0, a_0=16$.\n    Their 2-adic valuations are: $v(a_5)=0, v(a_3)=v(4)=2, v(a_0)=v(16)=4$.\n    The points for the lower convex hull of the Newton polygon are $(5,0), (3,2), (0,4)$.\n    The slopes of the segments of the Newton polygon are the negatives of the valuations of the roots.\n\n4.  **Root Clusters:** The roots of $f(y)$ are partitioned into clusters based on their valuations. All roots with the same valuation belong to the same group of clusters.\n\n5.  **Thickness Calculation:** The stable reduction of the curve will have a component for each cluster of roots. If two clusters are \"adjacent\", the corresponding components intersect at a double point (a node). The thickness of this node is given by the formula:\n    $\\delta = \\lfloor \\frac{1}{2} \\pi(C_1, C_2) \\rfloor$\n    where $C_1$ and $C_2$ are the two clusters of roots, and $\\pi(C_1, C_2) = \\sum_{\\alpha \\in C_1, \\beta \\in C_2} v(\\alpha - \\beta)$ is the \"potential\" between them. When the valuations of roots in $C_1$ and $C_2$ are different, $v(\\alpha - \\beta)$ simplifies to the minimum of the two valuations.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to calculate the thickness.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef get_valuation(n):\n    \"\"\"Computes the 2-adic valuation of an integer.\"\"\"\n    if n == 0:\n        return float('inf')\n    valuation = 0\n    while n % 2 == 0:\n        valuation += 1\n        n //= 2\n    return valuation\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the thickness of the double point of the stable reduction of the curve\n    z^2 = 2*x^5 + 2*x^3 + 1.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Step 1: Define the polynomial from the curve equation.\")\n    # Original polynomial P(x) = 2*x^5 + 2*x^3 + 1\n    print(\"The curve is z^2 = 2*x^5 + 2*x^3 + 1.\")\n    print(\"\\nStep 2: Transform the polynomial to be monic.\")\n    print(\"We use the substitution x = y/2.\")\n    print(\"The equation becomes 16*z^2 = y^5 + 4*y^3 + 16.\")\n    print(\"Let Z = 4z, the new model is Z^2 = f(y), where f(y) = y^5 + 4*y^3 + 16.\")\n    \n    # Coefficients of f(y)\n    coeffs = {0: 16, 1: 0, 2: 0, 3: 4, 4: 0, 5: 1}\n    \n    print(\"\\nStep 3: Determine the Newton Polygon and root valuations.\")\n    points = []\n    for i, coeff in coeffs.items():\n        if coeff != 0:\n            points.append((i, get_valuation(coeff)))\n    \n    # Sort points by degree\n    points.sort()\n    print(f\"The points for the Newton Polygon are (degree, valuation): {points}\")\n    \n    # The points for the lower convex hull are (0,4), (3,2), (5,0)\n    hull_points = [(0, 4), (3, 2), (5, 0)]\n    print(f\"The vertices of the lower convex hull are: {hull_points}\")\n    \n    # Calculate slopes and lengths\n    slopes = []\n    for i in range(len(hull_points) - 1):\n        p1 = hull_points[i]\n        p2 = hull_points[i+1]\n        slope = (p2[1] - p1[1]) / (p2[0] - p1[0])\n        length = p2[0] - p1[0]\n        slopes.append({'slope': slope, 'length': length})\n        \n    print(\"The slopes of the Newton Polygon segments are:\")\n    for s in slopes:\n        print(f\"  Slope: {s['slope']}, horizontal length: {s['length']}\")\n        \n    root_valuations = {}\n    print(\"The valuations of the roots are the negatives of the slopes:\")\n    for s in slopes:\n        valuation = -s['slope']\n        num_roots = s['length']\n        root_valuations[valuation] = num_roots\n        print(f\"  Valuation: {valuation}, number of roots: {num_roots}\")\n        \n    print(\"\\nStep 4: Identify the clusters of roots.\")\n    # The valuations are 2/3 and 1.
