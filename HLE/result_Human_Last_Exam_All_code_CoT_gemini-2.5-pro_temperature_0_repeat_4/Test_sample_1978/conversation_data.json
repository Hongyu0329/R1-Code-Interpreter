    "To find the index of the considered boundary-value problem, we need to determine the number of linearly independent solutions to the corresponding homogeneous problem.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n\n1.  **Clarify Problem Dimensions:** The problem statement presents a contradiction in the dimensions of the system. The vector $x(t)$ is defined to have 2024 components, and the boundary conditions involve $x_{2024}$, suggesting the system's dimension is $n=2024$. However, the matrix $A$ and vector $I(t)$ are described with a dimension of 202000. We will assume the dimension is $n=2024$, as it is more consistent with the specific details of the boundary conditions. The number 202000 is likely a typo.\n\n2.  **Define the Homogeneous Problem:** The index is the dimension of the solution space for the homogeneous problem:\n    *   $x'(t) = Ax(t)$\n    *   With the given boundary conditions.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Homogeneous ODE:** Since $A$ is a diagonal matrix, the system of differential equations is decoupled into $n=2024$ independent equations:\n    $x_i'(t) = -\\frac{1}{R_i} x_i(t)$\n    The general solution for each component is $x_i(t) = c_i e^{-t/R_i}$, where $c_i = x_i(0)$ is the initial condition. The entire solution $x(t)$ is determined by the vector of initial conditions $c = (c_1, c_2, ..., c_{2024})^T$.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Boundary Conditions:** We need to find the number of linearly independent boundary conditions.\n    *   $x_{1}(T) - x_{1}(0) = 0 \\implies x_{1}(0) = x_{1}(T)$\n    *   The next four conditions all simplify to $x_{2}(0) = x_{2}(T)$. They are linearly dependent, so they count as a single unique constraint on $x_2$.\n    *   $100x_{2024}(T) - 100x_{2024}(0) = 0 \\implies x_{2024}(0) = x_{2024}(T)$\n    In total, we have 3 linearly independent boundary conditions, which constrain the components $x_1$, $x_2$, and $x_{2024}$.\n\n5.  **Determine the Number of Free Parameters:**\n    *   For each constrained component $i \\in \\{1, 2, 2024\\}$, the boundary condition $x_i(0) = x_i(T)$ implies $c_i = c_i e^{-T/R_i}$. Assuming $T > 0$ and $R_i$ are finite (the standard generic case), $e^{-T/R_i} \\neq 1$. This forces the initial condition $c_i$ to be zero.\n    *   Therefore, the 3 independent boundary conditions fix 3 of the initial conditions ($c_1, c_2, c_{2024}$) to be 0.\n    *   The remaining components $x_i(t)$ for $i \\in \\{3, 4, ..., 2023\\}$ have no boundary conditions. Their initial conditions $c_i$ can be any real number.\n    *   The number of these \"free\" parameters is the total number of components minus the number of constrained components.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Index:** The index of the problem is the number of free parameters, which is the dimension of the solution space for the homogeneous problem.\n    *   Index = (Total dimension) - (Number of independent constraints)\n    *   Index = 2024 - 3 = 2021.\n\nThe following Python code implements this calculation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_problem_index():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the index of the given boundary-value problem.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Determine the dimension of the system.\n    # Based on x(t) = (x1(t), ..., x2024(t)) and the boundary condition on x_2024,\n    # we conclude the dimension of the system is 2024.\n    system_dimension = 2024\n\n    # Step 2: Determine the number of linearly independent boundary conditions.\n    # The boundary conditions are:\n    # 1. x_1(T) - x_1(0) = 0                  --> Constraint on x_1\n    # 2. x_2(T) - x_2(0) = 0                  --> Constraint on x_2\n    # 3. 5*x_2(T) - 5*x_2(0) = 0              --> Linearly dependent with condition 2\n    # 4. 100*x_2(T) - 100*x_2(0) = 0            --> Linearly dependent with condition 2\n    # 5. 1000*x_2(0) - 1000*x_2(T) = 0         --> Linearly dependent with condition 2\n    # 6. 100*x_2024(T) - 100*x_2024(0) = 0      --> Constraint on x_2024\n    #\n    # The unique components being constrained are x_1, x_2, and x_2024.\n    # Thus, there are 3 linearly independent constraints.\n    num_independent_conditions = 3\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate the index.\n    # The index of a boundary-value problem is the number of linearly independent solutions\n    # to the homogeneous problem.
