    "To find the rank of the third homotopy group $\\pi_3(X)$ of a smooth quintic hypersurface $X$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$, we can use a series of standard results from algebraic topology concerning the homotopy of pairs of spaces.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  Relate $\\pi_3(X)$ to the relative homotopy groups of the pair $(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X)$ using the long exact sequence of homotopy.\n2.  Calculate the Betti numbers of $X$, specifically $b_2(X)$, using the formula for the Euler characteristic of a hypersurface.\n3.  Use the relative Hurewicz theorem and Whitehead's exact sequence for highly connected pairs to determine the structure of the relevant relative homotopy group.\n4.  Combine these results to calculate the rank of $\\pi_3(X)$.\n\n### Step-by-step Derivation:\n\n1.  **Long Exact Sequence of Homotopy:**\n    Let's consider the long exact sequence of homotopy groups for the pair $(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X)$:\n    $$ \\dots \\to \\pi_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3) \\to \\pi_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X) \\to \\pi_3(X) \\to \\pi_3(\\mathbb{CP}^3) \\to \\dots $$\n    The homotopy groups of complex projective spaces are well-known. From the fibration $S^1 \\to S^7 \\to \\mathbb{CP}^3$, we know $\\pi_k(\\mathbb{CP}^3) \\cong \\pi_k(S^7)$ for $k \\ge 2$.\n    Thus, $\\pi_3(\\mathbb{CP}^3) \\cong \\pi_3(S^7) = 0$.\n    The sequence simplifies to:\n    $$ \\pi_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3) \\to \\pi_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X) \\to \\pi_3(X) \\to 0 $$\n    This means $\\pi_3(X)$ is the cokernel of the map $\\pi_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3) \\to \\pi_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X)$.\n    We also have $\\pi_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3) \\cong \\pi_4(S^7) = \\mathbb{Z}_2$, which is a torsion group. Since the rank of a quotient group is less than or equal to the rank of the original group, and the kernel here is torsion, we have:\n    $$ \\text{rank}(\\pi_3(X)) = \\text{rank}(\\pi_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X)) $$\n\n2.  **Betti Numbers of X:**\n    The Euler characteristic $\\chi(X)$ of a smooth hypersurface of degree $d$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^n$ is given by the formula:\n    $$ \\chi(X) = \\frac{(1-d)^{n+1}-1}{d} + (n+1) $$\n    For our quintic surface ($d=5$) in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$ ($n=3$):\n    $$ \\chi(X) = \\frac{(1-5)^{3+1}-1}{5} + (3+1) = \\frac{(-4)^4 - 1}{5} + 4 = \\frac{256-1}{5} + 4 = 51 + 4 = 55 $$\n    The Betti numbers of a smooth complex surface are related by $\\chi(X) = b_0 - b_1 + b_2 - b_3 + b_4$. By the Lefschetz hyperplane theorem, $X$ is connected ($b_0=1$) and simply connected ($b_1=0$). By Poincar√© duality, $b_3 = b_1 = 0$ and $b_4 = b_0 = 1$.\n    $$ 55 = 1 - 0 + b_2 - 0 + 1 = 2 + b_2 \\implies b_2(X) = 53 $$\n\n3.  **Relative Homotopy and Homology Groups:**\n    The pair $(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X)$ is 2-connected. By the relative Hurewicz theorem, this implies $\\pi_3(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X) \\cong H_3(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X)$. From the long exact sequence of homology for the pair, we can show that $H_3(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X)$ is a free abelian group of rank $b_2(X) - 1 = 53 - 1 = 52$. So, $\\pi_3(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^{52}$.\n\n4.  **Whitehead's Exact Sequence:**\n    For a 2-connected pair like $(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X)$, a theorem by J.H.C. Whitehead provides the following exact sequence:\n    $$ 0 \\to H_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X) \\to \\pi_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X) \\to \\Gamma(\\pi_3(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X)) \\to 0 $$\n    Here, $\\Gamma(A)$ is Whitehead's universal quadratic functor. For a free abelian group $A = \\mathbb{Z}^k$, $\\Gamma(A)$ is a free abelian group of rank $k(k+1)/2$.\n    The sequence splits because $\\Gamma(\\pi_3(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X))$ is a free group. Thus:\n    $$ \\pi_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X) \\cong H_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X) \\oplus \\Gamma(\\pi_3(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X)) $$\n    From the long exact sequence of homology, $H_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/5\\mathbb{Z}$, which is a torsion group and has rank 0.\n    Therefore, the rank of $\\pi_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X)$ is the rank of $\\Gamma(\\pi_3(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X))$.\n\n5.  **Final Calculation:**\n    We found $\\pi_3(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^{52}$. Let $k = 52$.\n    The rank of $\\Gamma(\\mathbb{Z}^k)$ is given by the formula $\\frac{k(k+1)}{2}$.\n    $$ \\text{rank}(\\pi_3(X)) = \\text{rank}(\\pi_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X)) = \\text{rank}(\\Gamma(\\mathbb{Z}^{52})) = \\frac{52 \\times (52+1)}{2} $$\n    This gives the final answer.\n\nThe following Python code calculates this value and prints the steps.\n\n```python\n# Define parameters for the hypersurface X\nn = 3  # Ambient space is CP^n\nd = 5  # Degree of the hypersurface\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the Euler characteristic of X\n# Formula: chi = ((1-d)^(n+1) - 1)/d + (n+1)\nchi = (pow(1 - d, n + 1) - 1) // d + (n + 1)\nprint(f\"The Euler characteristic of X is chi = {chi}\")\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the second Betti number b2(X)\n# For a smooth complex surface, chi = b0 - b1 + b2 - b3 + b4\n# b0=1, b1=0, b3=0, b4=1. So, chi = 2 + b2.\nb2 = chi - 2\nprint(f\"The second Betti number of X is b2 = {b2}\")\n\n# Step 3: Determine the rank of the relative homotopy group pi_3(CP^3, X)\n# This rank, k, is equal to b2(X) - 1.\nk = b2 - 1\nprint(f\"The rank of the relative homotopy group pi_3(CP^3, X) is k = b2 - 1 = {k}\")\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the rank of pi_3(X)\n# The rank of pi_3(X) is equal to the rank of Gamma(Z^k), which is k*(k+1)/2.\nrank_pi3_X = k * (k + 1) // 2\nprint(f\"The rank of pi_3(X) is given by the formula k*(k+1)/2.\")\nprint(f\"rank(pi_3(X)) = {k} * ({k} + 1) / 2 = {rank_pi3_X}\")\n\n```\n<<<1378>>>"
