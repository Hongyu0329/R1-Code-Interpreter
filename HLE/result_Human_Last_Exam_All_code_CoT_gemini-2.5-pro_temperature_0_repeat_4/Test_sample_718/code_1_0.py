The question asks for the integer 'n' for which a tame functor on an upper semilattice is n-resolvable.

1.  **Interpretation of Terms:**
    *   An 'upper semilattice' J is a specific type of partially ordered set (poset).
    *   A 'functor' f: J -> Vect_K is a representation of this poset.
    *   'Tame' refers to the representation type of the associated incidence algebra KJ. It means the representations are classifiable.
    *   'n-resolvable' means having a projective dimension of at most n.

2.  **Reasoning:**
    The problem is to find a universal bound on the projective dimension of representations for any tame upper semilattice.
    *   If the algebra were hereditary (the simplest case), the global dimension would be 1. So n would be 1.
    *   However, there are tame upper semilattices that are not hereditary. For example, the poset J = {0,1} x {0,1} is an upper semilattice, and its incidence algebra is tame with a global dimension of 2. This implies n must be at least 2.
    *   A significant issue is that many tame algebras possess modules in so-called 'tubes', which have infinite projective dimension. This would suggest no finite n exists.
    *   This contradiction implies the question likely refers to a characteristic property of tame algebras, possibly ignoring modules with infinite projective dimension (i.e., asking for the finitistic dimension) or referring to a key class of tame algebras.
    *   A large and important class of non-hereditary tame algebras are the 'canonical algebras', which have a global dimension of exactly 2.
    *   This convergence of evidence on the number 2—from examples like J = {0,1} x {0,1} and from the theory of canonical algebras—suggests that 2 is the characteristic number for the homological complexity of this class of representations.

3.  **Conclusion:**
    A tame functor f is 2-resolvable. This means that the second syzygy in its projective resolution is projective, or the projective dimension is at most 2, under the interpretation that we are considering the characteristic homological dimension for this class of problems.
    
The final answer is n = 2.
