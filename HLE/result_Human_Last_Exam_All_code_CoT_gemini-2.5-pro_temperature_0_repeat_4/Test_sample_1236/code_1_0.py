# Plan:
# 1. The problem decouples into independent scalar ODEs for each component x_i.
# 2. There are two types of equations based on the coefficient a_i(t).
# 3. For i <= 2024, a_i(t) = th(t). The homogeneous solution is C*ch(t), which is unbounded.
#    This leads to two conditions for a solution to the boundary value problem to exist:
#    - One condition on f_i(t) for the existence of any bounded solution.
#    - A second condition to satisfy the boundary values.
#    So, there are 2 conditions for each of these components.
# 4. For i > 2024, a_i(t) = -th(t). The homogeneous solution is C/ch(t), which is bounded.
#    This means a bounded solution exists for any f_i(t), with a free parameter C.
#    The boundary condition uniquely determines this parameter C.
#    So, there are 0 conditions for each of these components.
# 5. The total number of conditions is the sum from the first 2024 components.
