    "To find the number of categories with 2 objects and 4 morphisms up to isomorphism, we can follow a systematic approach. This problem involves classifying small categories, which requires considering the objects, morphisms, and the composition rules that must satisfy associativity and identity laws.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Identify Fixed Morphisms**: A category with two objects, let's call them `A` and `B`, must have an identity morphism for each object. These are `id_A: A -> A` and `id_B: B -> B`. This accounts for 2 of the 4 total morphisms.\n2.  **Distribute Remaining Morphisms**: We have 2 remaining non-identity morphisms to place. The possible locations are the four \"Hom-sets\": `Hom(A, A)`, `Hom(A, B)`, `Hom(B, A)`, and `Hom(B, B)`.\n3.  **Case Analysis**: We can analyze the problem by breaking it down into cases based on where these two morphisms are placed. For each case, we determine the number of valid, non-isomorphic category structures. Isomorphism means we don't need to distinguish between a category and one where the objects `A` and `B` are swapped.\n4.  **Define Composition Rules**: For each case, we must define the composition of morphisms and ensure the rules are associative.\n5.  **Sum the Results**: The total number of categories is the sum of the counts from all distinct cases.\n\nThis process is a combinatorial and algebraic enumeration. The Python code below will walk through the cases as identified by this plan and sum the results to find the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_category_count():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of non-isomorphic categories with 2 objects and 4 morphisms.\n\n    The calculation is based on a case-by-case analysis of how the two non-identity\n    morphisms can be distributed and how their compositions can be defined.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"Finding the number of non-isomorphic categories with 2 objects and 4 morphisms.\")\n    print(\"Let the objects be A and B.
