    "My plan is to compute the determinant of the given 3x3 matrix. The reference to the \"Markov quiver\" is context for the origin of the matrix, but the calculation itself is a standard determinant computation.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  Define the 3x3 matrix `A` using the `numpy` library in Python.\n2.  The determinant of a 3x3 matrix\n    `[[a, b, c], [d, e, f], [g, h, i]]`\n    is calculated using the formula: `a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg)`.\n3.  I will substitute the values from the given matrix `A` into this formula.\n4.  I will print each step of the calculation, showing how the numbers are substituted and simplified.\n5.  Finally, I will print the resulting determinant.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# The task is to compute the determinant of the given matrix A.\n# The context about \"Markov quiver for m_{1/2} = 13\" is additional information\n# that does not change the matrix A, which is explicitly provided.\n\n# Step 1: Define the matrix A.\nA = np.array([\n    [2, -1, -1],\n    [-1, 2, -1],\n    [-1, -1, 2]\n])\n\n# Step 2: Extract the elements of the matrix for the formula.\n# The formula for the determinant of a 3x3 matrix [[a, b, c], [d, e, f], [g, h, i]] is:\n# det(A) = a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg)\na, b, c = A[0, 0], A[0, 1], A[0, 2]\nd, e, f = A[1, 0], A[1, 1], A[1, 2]\ng, h, i = A[2, 0], A[2, 1], A[2, 2]\n\n# Step 3: Print the calculation process step-by-step.\nprint(f\"The given matrix A is:\\n{A}\\n\")\nprint(\"The determinant is calculated using the formula: a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg)\")\nprint(\"Substituting the values from matrix A into the formula:\")\n\n# Print the formula with the numbers substituted\nprint(f\"det(A) = ({a}) * (({e}) * ({i}) - ({f}) * ({h})) - ({b}) * (({d}) * ({i}) - ({f}) * ({g})) + ({c}) * (({d}) * ({h}) - ({e}) * ({g}))\")\n\n# Calculate the values inside the parentheses (the cofactors)\nval1 = e * i - f * h\nval2 = d * i - f * g\nval3 = d * h - e * g\nprint(f\"       = {a} * ({val1}) - ({b}) * ({val2}) + ({c}) * ({val3})\")\n\n# Calculate the products\nprod1 = a * val1\nprod2 = -b * val2\nprod3 = c * val3\nprint(f\"       = {prod1} + ({prod2}) + ({prod3})\")\n\n# Calculate the final sum\ndeterminant = prod1 + prod2 + prod3\nprint(f\"       = {determinant}\")\n\n# As a verification, we can use numpy's built-in function\n# Note: numpy might return a very small floating point number close to 0 due to precision.\nfinal_determinant = round(np.linalg.det(A))\nprint(f\"\\nThe determinant of the adjacency matrix is: {final_determinant}\")\n```\n<<<0>>>"
