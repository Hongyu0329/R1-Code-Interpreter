    "Of course, I can help with that. The ideal Ni/Ce ratio is a critical parameter for maximizing catalytic performance, as it influences the dispersion of Ni, the formation of the crucial Ni-CeO₂ interface, and the concentration of oxygen vacancies.\n\nHere is my plan to answer your question:\n1.  I will first explain that the \"ideal\" ratio is not a single fixed number but typically falls within an optimal range found through experimental research. It depends heavily on the synthesis method and reaction conditions.\n2.  The key to high catalytic activity is maximizing the active sites at the interface between the nickel nanoparticles and the ceria support. Too much nickel can lead to the formation of larger Ni particles (sintering), which reduces the active surface area. Too little nickel results in an insufficient number of active sites.\n3.  Based on a review of scientific literature, a common optimal range for the **atomic molar ratio of Ni/Ce** has been identified.\n4.  I will provide a Python script that prints this explanation and highlights the generally accepted optimal ratio.\n\n```python\ndef find_ideal_ratio():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains and provides the ideal Ni/Ce ratio for catalytic reactions\n    based on findings from scientific literature.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"The ideal Ni/Ce ratio for Ni-Ceria catalysts is not a single, universal value.\")\n    print(\"It depends on factors like synthesis method, particle size, and specific reaction conditions (e.g., temperature, pressure).\")\n    print(\"\\nHowever, extensive research has identified an optimal range that maximizes catalytic performance for reactions like Water Gas Shift (WGS) and water splitting.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe goal is to achieve high dispersion of Ni atoms on the Ceria (CeO₂) support, maximizing the active Ni-CeO₂ interface.\")\n    \n    # Define the optimal range based on literature\n    # This is typically expressed as an atomic or molar ratio.\n    lower_bound_ratio = 0.1\n    upper_bound_ratio = 0.2\n    \n    print(\"\\n--- Key Finding ---\")\n    print(\"A low Ni loading is generally preferred to prevent the agglomeration (sintering) of Ni particles and to promote strong metal-support interactions.\")\n    print(f\"The most frequently reported optimal atomic molar ratio of Ni/Ce is in the range of {lower_bound_ratio} to {upper_bound_ratio}.\")\n    print(f\"This corresponds to an atomic composition of 1 Ni atom for every 5 to 10 Ce atoms.\")\n    \n    # Example of a highly cited ratio within this range\n    example_ratio = 0.11\n    \n    print(f\"\\nFor example, a ratio of approximately {example_ratio} (often prepared as 10 wt% Ni on CeO₂) is frequently cited for achieving high catalytic activity and stability.\")\n\n# Execute the function to print the information\nfind_ideal_ratio()\n```\n<<<A Ni/Ce molar ratio of approximately 0.1 to 0.2>>>"
