    "To scan the Latin hexameter line, we must determine the quantity (long or short) of each syllable and group them into six feet. Each foot is either a dactyl (long, short, short) or a spondee (long, long). This particular line from Virgil is famous for its metrical irregularities, which require applying some less common rules.\n\nHere is the step-by-step scansion:\n\n**Line:** `verum ubi equi atque hominis casu convenit imago.`\n\n1.  **Foot 1: `verum ubi` -> Dactyl (D)**\n    *   The `-um` of `verum` elides (is omitted) because the next word, `ubi`, starts with a vowel.\n    *   The `e` in `verum` (`vērum`) is naturally long.\n    *   The syllables `u` and `bi` in `ubi` are both short.\n    *   This forms a long-short-short pattern (— U U), which is a **Dactyl**.\n\n2.  **Foot 2: `equi atque` -> Spondee (S)**\n    *   This foot requires a special rule called **synizesis**, where the two vowels in `equi` are pronounced as a single syllable (`eqwī`). This syllable is treated as long.\n    *   The syllable `at-` in `atque` is long by position because its vowel `a` is followed by two consonants (`t` and `qu`).\n    *   This forms a long-long pattern (— —), which is a **Spondee**.\n\n3.  **Foot 3: `hominis` -> Dactyl (D)**\n    *   The `-que` at the end of `atque` elides with the `h` in `hominis`.\n    *   To fit the meter, the first syllable `ho-` (naturally short) is metrically lengthened to be long.\n    *   The syllables `-mi-` and `-nis` are treated as short.\n    *   This forms a long-short-short pattern (— U U), a **Dactyl**.\n\n4.  **Foot 4: `casu` -> Spondee (S)**\n    *   In `casu` (`cāsū`), both the `a` and the `u` are naturally long.\n    *   This forms a long-long pattern (— —), which is a **Spondee**.\n\n5.  **Foot 5: `convenit` -> Dactyl (D)**\n    *   The first syllable `con-` is long by position (followed by `n` and `v`).\n    *   The syllables `-ve-` and `-nit` are both short.\n    *   This forms a long-short-short pattern (— U U), which is a **Dactyl**.\n\n6.  **Foot 6: `imago` -> Spondee (S)**\n    *   The first syllable `i-` (naturally short) is metrically lengthened to be long.\n    *   The second syllable `-ma-` is naturally long. The final syllable of a hexameter line is always treated as long.\n    *   This forms a long-long pattern (— —), which is a **Spondee**.\n\nCombining these gives the final scansion.\n\n```python\ndef scan_hexameter_line():\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints the scansion of the specified Latin hexameter line.\n    D = Dactyl (— U U)\n    S = Spondee (— —)\n    \"\"\"\n    line = \"verum ubi equi atque hominis casu convenit imago.\"\n    foot_1 = \"D\"\n    foot_2 = \"S\"\n    foot_3 = \"D\"\n    foot_4 = \"S\"\n    foot_5 = \"D\"\n    foot_6 = \"S\"\n    \n    scansion = f\"{foot_1} {foot_2} {foot_3} {foot_4} {foot_5} {foot_6}\"\n    \n    print(f\"The line is: \\\"{line}\\\"\")\n    print(f\"The scansion is: {scansion}\")\n\nscan_hexameter_line()\n```\n<<<D S D S D S>>>"
