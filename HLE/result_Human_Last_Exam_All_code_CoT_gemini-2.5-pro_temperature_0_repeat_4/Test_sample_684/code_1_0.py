    This function finds and prints the integer values of n in the range [7, 55]
    for which it is possible to leave exactly one gift on a 5D hypercube.

    over the field F_2. The problem is solvable if and only if the dimension 'n'
    of the hypercube satisfies the condition n % 7 == 1.

    This code iterates through the given range and prints the values of n that
