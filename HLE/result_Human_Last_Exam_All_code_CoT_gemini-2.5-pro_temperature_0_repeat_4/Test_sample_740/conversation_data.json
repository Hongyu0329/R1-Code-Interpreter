    "To solve this problem, we first need to understand the nature of the integral equation. This is a Fredholm integral equation of the second kind with a degenerate (or separable) kernel.\n\nThe kernel is `K(x, y) = (xⁿ - yⁿ) / (x - y)`. Using the formula for the sum of a geometric series, we can expand the kernel as:\n`K(x, y) = xⁿ⁻¹ + xⁿ⁻²y + ... + xyⁿ⁻² + yⁿ⁻¹ = ∑_{i=1 to n} xⁿ⁻ⁱ yⁱ⁻¹`\n\nThe integral equation is `u(x) = 1 + λ ∫₀¹ K(x, y) u(y) dy`.\nSubstituting the expanded kernel, we get:\n`u(x) = 1 + λ ∑_{i=1 to n} xⁿ⁻ⁱ ∫₀¹ yⁱ⁻¹ u(y) dy`\n\nLet's define `n` constants `cᵢ = ∫₀¹ yⁱ⁻¹ u(y) dy` for `i = 1, ..., n`.\nThe solution `u(x)` must then be a polynomial of degree at most `n-1`:\n`u(x) = 1 + λ ∑_{i=1 to n} cᵢ xⁿ⁻ⁱ`\n\nTo find the constants `cᵢ`, we substitute this form of `u(x)` back into their definitions:\n`cⱼ = ∫₀¹ yʲ⁻¹ (1 + λ ∑_{i=1 to n} cᵢ yⁿ⁻ⁱ) dy`\n`cⱼ = ∫₀¹ yʲ⁻¹ dy + λ ∑_{i=1 to n} cᵢ ∫₀¹ yʲ⁻¹ yⁿ⁻ⁱ dy`\n`cⱼ = 1/j + λ ∑_{i=1 to n} cᵢ / (n + j - i)`\n\nThis is a system of `n` linear equations for the `n` unknowns `c₁, ..., cₙ`. We can write it in matrix form as:\n`(I - λA)c = b`\nwhere `c` is the vector of `cᵢ`, `b` is a vector with elements `bⱼ = 1/j`, and `A` is a matrix with elements `Aⱼᵢ = 1 / (n + j - i)`.\n\nThe equation has no unique solution if the determinant of the matrix `(I - λA)` is zero. This occurs when `λ` is the reciprocal of an eigenvalue `μ` of the matrix `A`.\n`det(I - λA) = 0  =>  det(A - (1/λ)I) = 0  =>  1/λ = μ`\n\nWhen `det(I - λA) = 0`, the system can have either no solutions or infinitely many solutions. According to the Fredholm alternative theorem, for a self-adjoint operator (which this is), the inhomogeneous equation has a solution if and only if the right-hand side (`f(x)=1` in our case) is orthogonal to the null space of the homogeneous equation.\nIt can be shown that for the eigenvalues of matrix `A`, this orthogonality condition is not met. Therefore, for any `λ` that is a reciprocal of an eigenvalue of `A`, the equation has no solution.\n\nThe problem is thus reduced to finding the eigenvalues of the matrix `A` for a given `n` and taking their reciprocals. Since `n` is not specified, I will provide a Python script that can solve for any given `n` and demonstrate its use for `n=2`.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport math\n\ndef find_lambda_no_solution(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the values of lambda for which the given integral equation has no solution for a specific n.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The exponent in the kernel of the integral equation.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of values for lambda.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n < 1:\n        return []\n\n    # Construct the matrix A\n    # A[j, i] = 1 / (n + j - i), for i,j from 1 to n.\n    A = np.zeros((n, n))\n    for j in range(1, n + 1):\n        for i in range(1, n + 1):\n            A[j - 1, i - 1] = 1.0 / (n + j - i)\n\n    # The values of lambda for which there is no unique solution are the\n    # reciprocals of the eigenvalues of A.\n    # We need to confirm that for these lambda, there are NO solutions,\n    # not infinitely many.
