    This function identifies the starting material for a given chemical reaction.

    The reaction is a Robinson annulation, which involves a Michael addition
    followed by an intramolecular aldol condensation.

    Product: ethyl 4-methyl-7-oxo-1,2,3,4,4a,5,6,7-octahydronaphthalene-4a-carboxylate
    Reagents: 1. A starting compound, 2. Methyl vinyl ketone, 3. Potassium methoxide, 4. Potassium carbonate

    By performing a retrosynthetic analysis of the Robinson annulation, we deduce
    the structure of the unknown starting material. The analysis shows that the
    starting material must be a cyclic beta-keto ester.

    The final name is constructed based on the positions of the functional groups
    (ketone, ester, and methyl) required to form the given product.
