    "To find the separatrix of the given system of differential equations, we will follow these steps. A separatrix is a special trajectory in the phase plane that separates regions of different long-term behavior. Such trajectories are often the stable or unstable manifolds of saddle points. A powerful method to find them is to look for an invariant curve, which is a curve $d=f(u)$ that is itself a solution trajectory.\n\nOur plan is as follows:\n1.  First, we will derive the differential equation for the trajectories in the $(u, d)$ phase plane by computing $\\frac{d(d)}{du} = \\frac{d'(t)}{u'(t)}$.\n2.  The resulting equation is a Riccati differential equation, which is generally difficult to solve. However, we can test if a simple particular solution exists. By inspecting the powers of $u$ and $d$ in the equations, we can hypothesize a solution of the form $d(u) = c \\cdot u^k$. The structure of the equation suggests that $k=2$ is a good candidate.\n3.  We will therefore test for a solution of the form $d(u) = c \\cdot u^2$. We will substitute this guess into the trajectory equation.\n4.  For our guess to be a valid solution, the resulting equation must hold true for all values of $u$. This will allow us to solve for the constant $c$.\n5.  We will use a Python script with the `sympy` library to perform these symbolic calculations and find the value of $c$. The resulting equation $d = c u^2$ will be the equation of the separatrix.\n\nHere is the Python code to execute this plan:\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\ndef find_separatrix_equation():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function finds the equation of the separatrix for the given system of ODEs.\n\n    The system is:\n    d'(t) = 2*d**2 + (5*u**2 - 3*u)*d - u**3*(1-u)\n    u'(t) = u**2 * (u - 1)\n\n    The method involves finding a particular solution to the trajectory equation\n    dd/du = d_prime / u_prime of the form d = c*u**2.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the symbolic variables for u and the constant c\n    u, c = sp.symbols('u c')\n\n    # 1.

Form the trajectory equation: dd/du = d_prime / u_prime\n    # We create an algebraic equation that must be true if our guess is correct.\n    # dd_du_guess * u_prime - d_prime = 0\n    equation = sp.simplify(dd_du_guess * u_prime - d_prime)\n\n    # 4. For the equation to hold for all u, it must be a zero polynomial in u.\n    # We extract the coefficients of the polynomial in u and set them to zero.\n    poly_in_u = sp.Poly(equation, u)\n    coefficients = poly_in_u.coeffs()\n\n    # 5.
