    "To determine which ballet step has the same ending and starting leg position, I will analyze each option. My plan is to describe the movement for each step, focusing on the position of the legs at the beginning and at the end of the movement. I will then use a Python script to print this analysis and identify the correct answer.\n\n1.  **Entrechat six**: This is a jump straight up from fifth position where the legs beat six times (three crossings for each leg) and land back in the original fifth position. The starting and ending positions are identical.\n2.  **Échappé battu changé**: This step starts in a closed position (like fifth), jumps to an open position (like second), and then jumps back to the closed position, but with the feet *changed* (*changé*). The ending position is different from the start because the other foot is now in front.\n3.  **Assemblé**: This step starts on one foot, with the other leg extended. The dancer jumps, brings the legs together (*assembles*) in the air, and lands on both feet in fifth position. The start (one foot) and end (two feet) positions are different.\n4.  **Glissade derrière**: This is a gliding, traveling step. It starts in fifth position, the back foot glides out, and the front foot closes *behind* it into fifth position. Because the feet have switched places, the ending position is different from the start.\n5.  **Gargouillade**: This is a complex jump similar to a *pas de chat* but with a circular movement (*rond de jambe*) from each leg. It typically involves changing the feet, so the ending fifth position is not the same as the starting one.\n\nBased on this analysis, the Entrechat six is the only step listed that finishes in the exact same position it started from.\n\n```python\ndef find_ballet_step():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes classical ballet steps to find which one has the same\n    starting and ending leg position.\n    \"\"\"\n    steps_analysis = {\n        'A': {\n            'name': 'Entrechat six',\n            'description': 'Starts in fifth position, jumps vertically, beats six times, and lands in the same fifth position.'\n        },\n        'B': {\n            'name': 'Échappé battu changé',\n            'description': 'Starts in fifth position, jumps to second, then lands back in fifth position but with the feet changed.'\n        },\n        'C': {\n            'name': 'Assemblé',\n            'description': 'Starts on one foot, jumps, and lands on two feet in fifth position.'\n        },\n        'D': {\n            'name': 'Glissade derrière',\n            'description': 'Starts in fifth position, travels, and closes in fifth position with the feet having changed places.'\n        },\n        'E': {\n            'name': 'Gargouillade',\n            'description': 'A complex jump that typically finishes with the feet changed from their starting position.'\n        }\n    }\n\n    correct_answer = 'A'\n    \n    print(\"Analysis of Ballet Steps:\")\n    for option, details in steps_analysis.items():\n        print(f\"\\nOption {option}: {details['name']}\")\n        print(f\"   - Movement: {details['description']}\")\n\n    print(\"\\nConclusion:\")\n    print(\"An Entrechat six is a vertical jump that begins and ends in the same position without traveling or changing the feet.\")\n    print(f\"Therefore, the correct option is {correct_answer}.\")\n\nfind_ballet_step()\n```\n<<<A>>>"
