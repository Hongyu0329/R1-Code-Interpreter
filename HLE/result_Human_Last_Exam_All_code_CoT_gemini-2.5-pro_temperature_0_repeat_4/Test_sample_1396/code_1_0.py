# The problem asks for the most realistic upper bound O for a connected
# ε-envy-free allocation for four agents. The state-of-the-art complexity
# bound for this problem, based on the work of Goldberg et al. (2020), is O(1/ε).

# This complexity is often analyzed in the form O((1/ε)^k), where the
# exponent 'k' is a crucial measure of the algorithm's efficiency.
# A smaller 'k' means the algorithm is less sensitive to the precision ε.

# For the bound O(1/ε), the exponent k is 1. This is the tightest known
# exponent for this problem. We identify this value as the most realistic
# numerical answer representing the upper bound's nature.
k = 1

# The final equation for the complexity bound is O((1/ε)^k).
# We print the value of the exponent k.
