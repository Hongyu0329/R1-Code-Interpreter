    "To solve this problem, we need to find the specific sequence of red and blue pieces that represents the value $\\frac{13}{16}$ in red-blue Hackenbush.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Understand the Value of a Hackenbush Stalk:** The value of a simple stalk of colored pieces (a \"flower\") in red-blue Hackenbush is calculated with the formula:\n    $V = \\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\frac{s_i}{2^{i-1}} = s_1 + \\frac{s_2}{2} + \\frac{s_3}{4} + \\dots + \\frac{s_k}{2^{k-1}}$\n    where:\n    *   `k` is the total number of pieces.\n    *   `i` is the position of the piece from the ground up (i=1 is the bottom piece).\n    *   `s_i` is `+1` if the piece is red and `-1` if the piece is blue.\n\n2.  **Find the Sequence for $\\frac{13}{16}$:** We need to find the sequence of signs ($s_1, s_2, \\dots, s_k$) that makes the sum `V` equal to $\\frac{13}{16}$. We can do this with an iterative algorithm:\n    *   Start with the target value, `val` = $\\frac{13}{16}$.\n    *   In each step, determine the sign of the next piece (`s_i`). The sign is chosen to be `+1` or `-1` based on the current `val`. The correct choice is the one that keeps the remaining value representable by the rest of the series. A simple rule that works is to choose `+1` if `val > 0` and `-1` if `val < 0`.\n    *   Add the chosen sign to our sequence.\n    *   Update the value for the next iteration using the formula: `new_val = 2 * (current_val - s_i)`.\n    *   Repeat until the value becomes 0. Since $\\frac{13}{16}$ is a dyadic rational (a fraction with a power of 2 in the denominator), this process is guaranteed to terminate with a finite number of pieces.\n\n3.  **Count the Pieces:** The total number of pieces is simply the length of the sequence of signs we found.\n\n4.  **Implement in Python:** I will provide a Python script that performs these calculations, prints the resulting equation for clarity, and outputs the final count.\n\n```python\nimport fractions\n\ndef solve_hackenbush_representation():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of pieces and the specific sequence required to\n    represent a given fraction in red-blue-Hackenbush.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The target number to represent\n    target_val = fractions.Fraction(13, 16)\n\n    # This list will store the sequence of signs (+1 for Red, -1 for Blue)\n    signs = []\n    # Start with the target value\n    current_val = target_val\n\n    # Loop to determine the sign of each piece in the stalk\n    # We add a limit to prevent accidental infinite loops, though it's not\n    # needed for dyadic rationals.\n    for _ in range(32):\n        # If the value is zero, we have perfectly represented the number.\n        if current_val == 0:\n            break\n\n        # Determine the sign for the current piece.
