    # Part (a): True or False: In the doubling construction, each element of Q x {0, 1}
    # is contained in exactly v - 1 ND-pairs.

    # Let's count the number of *distinct* ND-pairs containing a generic element, (x, 0).
    # These ND-pairs are formed by two rules:
    # Rule 1 (from the original SQS nesting): Generates pairs of the form {(x, 0), (y, 0)}
    # for each y in Q where y != x. There are (v - 1) such distinct pairs.
    num_distinct_pairs_type1 = "v - 1"

    # Rule 2 (from pairs in Q): Generates the pair {(x, 0), (x, 1)}.
    # This is 1 distinct pair.
    num_distinct_pairs_type2 = 1

    # The total number of distinct ND-pairs containing (x, 0) is the sum.
    # Total = (v - 1) + 1 = v.
    # The statement claims the number is v - 1.
    # Since v >= 4, v != v - 1. Thus, the statement is False.
    answer_a = "False"

    # Part (b): What is the multiplicity of an ND-pair {(x, 0), (y, 0)} if the
    # pair {x, y} had multiplicity mu in the original SQS(v)?

    # The ND-pair {(x, 0), (y, 0)} is generated only by Rule 1.
    # This rule creates one pair {(x, 0), (y, 0)} for each time {x, y} appears
    # as an ND-pair in the original system.
    # The multiplicity of {x, y} in the original system is given as mu.
    # Therefore, the multiplicity of {(x, 0), (y, 0)} is also mu.
    answer_b = "Î¼"

    # Part (c): Must there exist ND-pairs with multiplicity exactly v?

    # Let's determine the multiplicities of all types of ND-pairs.
    # Note: In a valid nested SQS(v), mu is always equal to v - 1.

    # 1. Multiplicity of {(x, 0), (y, 0)} (for x != y): From part (b), this is mu = v - 1.
    # 2. Multiplicity of {(x, 1), (y, 1)} (for x != y): By symmetry, this is also v - 1.
    # 3. Multiplicity of {(x, 0), (x, 1)}: This pair is generated by Rule 2.
    #    For each y != x, the block based on {x, y} generates one such pair.
    #    There are v - 1 choices for y, so the multiplicity is v - 1.
    # 4. Multiplicity of {(x, 0), (y, 1)} (for x != y): This pair is never generated. Multiplicity is 0.

    # The possible non-zero multiplicities are all v - 1.
    # We are asked if any multiplicity is exactly v.
    # Since v >= 4, v is never equal to v - 1.
    # Therefore, no ND-pair has a multiplicity of v.
    answer_c = "No"

    # Print the final formatted answer.
    print(f"(a) {answer_a}; (b) {answer_b}; (c) {answer_c}")
