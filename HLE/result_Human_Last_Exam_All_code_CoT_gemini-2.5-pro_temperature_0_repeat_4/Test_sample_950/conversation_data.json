    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  First, I will identify the mathematical space described in the question. The \"space of $3$-subspaces of $\\mathbb{R}^5$\" is a well-known object in mathematics called a Grassmannian manifold.\n2.  Next, I will recall the properties of the integral cohomology ring of this space. There is a fundamental theorem about the structure of the cohomology of Grassmannians.\n3.  This theorem states that the integral cohomology ring is a free abelian group. I will explain what this means in terms of torsion.\n4.  The torsion subgroup of a torsion-free group is the trivial group, which contains only the identity element.\n5.  The rank of a group is a measure of its \"size\". The rank of the trivial group is 0.\n6.  Finally, I will write a Python script that summarizes these points and prints the final numerical answer.\n\n```python\n# The user wants to find the rank of the torsion subgroup of the integral cohomology ring\n# of the space of 3-subspaces of R^5.\n\n# Step 1: Identify the space.\n# The space of k-dimensional subspaces of an n-dimensional vector space R^n is called\n# the real Grassmannian manifold, denoted G(k, n).\n# In this case, we are looking at the space of 3-subspaces of R^5, which is G(3, 5).\nspace_k = 3\nspace_n = 5\nprint(f\"The space is the Grassmannian G({space_k}, {space_n}).\")\n\n# Step 2: Recall the structure of the integral cohomology ring.\n# A fundamental theorem in algebraic topology states that the integral cohomology ring\n# of any real Grassmannian, H*(G(k, n); Z), is a free abelian group.\n# A free abelian group is, by definition, torsion-free.\nprint(\"The integral cohomology ring of a Grassmannian is known to be torsion-free.\")\n\n# Step 3: Characterize the torsion subgroup.\n# The torsion subgroup of an abelian group A is the subgroup consisting of all elements\n# of finite order.\n# For a torsion-free group, the only element of finite order is the identity element (0).\n# Therefore, the torsion subgroup is the trivial group {0}.\nprint(\"For a torsion-free group, the torsion subgroup is the trivial group {0}.\")\n\n# Step 4: Determine the rank of the torsion subgroup.\n# The rank of an abelian group is the dimension of the vector space obtained by tensoring\n# the group with the field of rational numbers.\n# The rank of the trivial group {0} is 0.\nrank = 0\nprint(f\"The rank of the torsion subgroup is therefore {rank}.\")\n```\n<<<0>>>"
