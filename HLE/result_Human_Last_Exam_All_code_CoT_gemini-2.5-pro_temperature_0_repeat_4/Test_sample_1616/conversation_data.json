    "Here is my plan to solve this linguistic puzzle.\n\n1.  **Define Trisyllabic Laxing:** First, I'll clarify the rule of Trisyllabic Laxing. It's a sound change in English where a long vowel or diphthong in a root word becomes a short vowel when a suffix is added, making the word at least three syllables long and placing that vowel in the antepenultimate (third-from-last) syllable. A classic example is `sane` (/eɪ/, long) becoming `sanity` (/æ/, short).\n\n2.  **Analyze Each Word:** I will examine each word from the list to see if it fits this pattern.\n    *   **southern:** From `south` (/aʊ/). The derived word is `southern` (/ʌ/). This shows vowel shortening, but the word is only two syllables, so it's not *trisyllabic* laxing.\n    *   **derivative:** From `derive` (/aɪ/). The derived word is `derivative` (/ɪ/). The vowel is in the antepenultimate syllable (`de-RIV-a-tive`). This is a perfect example of trisyllabic laxing.\n    *   **serenity:** From `serene` (/iː/). The derived word is `serenity` (/ɛ/). The vowel is in the antepenultimate syllable (`se-REN-i-ty`). This is also a perfect example.\n    *   **pleasant:** From `please` (/iː/). The derived word is `pleasant` (/ɛ/). This shows vowel shortening, but the word is only two syllables, so it's not *trisyllabic* laxing.\n    *   **gratitude:** From a root related to `grate(ful)` (/eɪ/). The derived word is `gratitude` (/æ/). The vowel is in the antepenultimate syllable (`GRAT-i-tude`). This is another clear example.\n    *   **shadow:** This word comes from Old English `sceadu`. Its first vowel was already short. It is not derived from a modern English root word with a long vowel (e.g., it is not derived from `shade`). Therefore, it has not undergone the process of laxing from a long vowel.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:** `Derivative`, `serenity`, and `gratitude` clearly show trisyllabic laxing. `Southern` and `pleasant` show vowel shortening but not in a trisyllabic environment. `Shadow` does not show this vowel alternation at all, as its root vowel was not long to begin with. Therefore, `shadow` is the word that has not undergone this sound change.\n\nI will now generate a Python script to present this analysis.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_trisyllabic_laxing():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes a list of words to determine which has not undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n    Trisyllabic laxing shortens a long vowel when it's in the third-to-last syllable of a word.\n    \"\"\"\n    words_analysis = {\n        \"southern\": {\n            \"root\": \"south (/aʊ/)\",\n            \"derived\": \"southern (/ʌ/)\",\n            \"syllables\": 2,\n            \"undergone_laxing\": \"No (not trisyllabic, only 2 syllables)\"\n        },\n        \"derivative\": {\n            \"root\": \"derive (/aɪ/)\",\n            \"derived\": \"derivative (/ɪ/)\",\n            \"syllables\": 4,\n            \"undergone_laxing\": \"Yes (de-RIV-a-tive)\"\n        },\n        \"serenity\": {\n            \"root\": \"serene (/iː/)\",\n            \"derived\": \"serenity (/ɛ/)\",\n            \"syllables\": 3,\n            \"undergone_laxing\": \"Yes (se-REN-i-ty)\"\n        },\n        \"pleasant\": {\n            \"root\": \"please (/iː/)\",\n            \"derived\": \"pleasant (/ɛ/)\",\n            \"syllables\": 2,\n            \"undergone_laxing\": \"No (not trisyllabic, only 2 syllables)\"\n        },\n        \"gratitude\": {\n            \"root\": \"grate (/eɪ/)\",\n            \"derived\": \"gratitude (/æ/)\",\n            \"syllables\": 3,\n            \"undergone_laxing\": \"Yes (GRAT-i-tude)\"\n        },\n        \"shadow\": {\n            \"root\": \"Old English 'sceadu' (short vowel)\",\n            \"derived\": \"shadow (/æ/)\",\n            \"syllables\": 2,\n            \"undergone_laxing\": \"No (vowel was not long in the root word)\"\n        }\n    }\n\n    print(\"Analyzing words for Trisyllabic Laxing:\\n\")\n    final_answer = \"\"\n    for word, analysis in words_analysis.items():\n        print(f\"Word: {word.capitalize()}\")\n        print(f\"  - Root Word (Vowel Sound): {analysis['root']}\")\n        print(f\"  - Derived Word (Vowel Sound): {analysis['derived']}\")\n        print(f\"  - Syllables: {analysis['syllables']}\")\n        print(f\"  - Undergone Trisyllabic Laxing?: {analysis['undergone_laxing']}\")\n        print(\"-\" * 20)\n        if analysis[\"undergone_laxing\"] == \"No (vowel was not long in the root word)\":\n            final_answer = word\n\n    print(\"\\nConclusion:\")\n    print(\"'Derivative', 'serenity', and 'gratitude' are clear examples of trisyllabic laxing.\")\n    print(\"'Southern' and 'pleasant' show vowel shortening, but not in a trisyllabic context.\")\n    print(\"'Shadow' is the only word that does not derive from a root with a long vowel that was shortened.\")\n    print(\"Therefore, 'shadow' has not undergone this sound change.\")\n    print(f\"\\n<<< {final_answer} >>>\")\n\nanalyze_trisyllabic_laxing()\n```"
