    "This is a historical/linguistic question rather than a computational one. My plan is to first find the modern French equivalent of the Gaulish name \"Odobeccus\" from historical sources. Then, I will write a Python script that stores both the original name and its French equivalent in variables and prints a sentence stating the relationship between them.\n\n```python\ndef find_french_equivalent():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides the French equivalent of the Gaulish name 'Odobeccus'.\n    \"\"\"\n    gaulish_name = \"Odobeccus\"\n    french_name = \"Eudouvac\"\n\n    print(f\"The French equivalent of the Gaulish name '{gaulish_name}' is '{french_name}'.\")\n\nfind_french_equivalent()\n```\n<<<Eudouvac>>>"
