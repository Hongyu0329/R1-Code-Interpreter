    # Let G be a graph with n vertices.
    # Let S be the set of all possible sizes of induced cliques in G.
    # We want to find the maximum possible value of |S|.

    # Key Insight: If a graph G has an induced clique of size k_max,
    # it must also have induced cliques of all sizes j where 1 <= j < k_max.
    # This is because any subset of vertices from a clique also induces a clique.
    # Therefore, the set of induced clique sizes S is always of the form {1, 2, ..., k_max},
    # where k_max is the size of the largest induced clique in G (the clique number).
    # The number of different clique sizes is |S| = k_max.

    # The problem is now to find the maximum possible value of k_max for a graph with n vertices.
    
    # The size of any clique in a graph cannot be larger than the total number of vertices.
    # This gives us the fundamental equation/constraint.
    # k_max <= n
    
    # The maximum possible value for k_max is therefore n.
    # This maximum is achieved by a specific graph: the complete graph K_n,
    # where all vertices are connected to each other. In this graph, the set of all
    # n vertices forms a clique of size n.
