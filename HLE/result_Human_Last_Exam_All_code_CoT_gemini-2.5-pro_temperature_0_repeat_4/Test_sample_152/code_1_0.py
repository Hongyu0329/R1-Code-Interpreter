# This script deduces the properties of Cell 9 based on the patterns observed in Cells 1-8.

# --- Step 1: Determine the Shape ---
# The shapes are grouped in threes: 3 Circles, 3 Squares, and then 3 Triangles.
# Cell 9 is the third cell in the third group, so its shape is a Triangle.
cell9_shape = "Triangle"
print(f"Shape Analysis: The pattern is 3 Circles, 3 Squares, 3 Triangles. Cell 9 is a {cell9_shape}.")

# --- Step 2: Determine the Number of Dots ---
# The relationship between the dot count of the second and third cell in each group alternates.
# - Circle Group (Cell 2 -> 3): 4 dots -> 2 dots. Operation is division by 2.
# - Square Group (Cell 5 -> 6): 1.5 dots -> 3 dots. Operation is multiplication by 2.
# The pattern of operations is /2, *2, /2. The Triangle group uses division.
# Cell 8 has 3 dots.
cell8_dots = 3
operand = 2
cell9_dots = cell8_dots / operand
print(f"Dots Analysis: The operation for the Triangle group is division by 2.")
print(f"Dots Calculation: {cell8_dots} / {operand} = {cell9_dots}")

# --- Step 3: Determine the Arrow Position ---
# The arrow position follows the same alternating operational pattern.
# - Circle Group (Cell 2 -> 3): 240° -> 120°. Operation is division by 2.
# - Square Group (Cell 5 -> 6): 90° -> 180°. Operation is multiplication by 2.
# The Triangle group will also use division by 2.
# Cell 8's arrow is at π radians, which is 180°.
cell8_angle_deg = 180
cell9_angle_deg = cell8_angle_deg / operand
print(f"Arrow Analysis: The operation for the Triangle group is division by 2.")
print(f"Arrow Calculation: {cell8_angle_deg}° / {operand} = {int(cell9_angle_deg)}°")

# --- Step 4: Format the Final Answer ---
# Format dots from 1.5 to "1½"
cell9_dots_str = "1½"

# Format angle based on rules: radians if divisible by π/3 (60°), degrees otherwise.
# 90° is not divisible by 60°, so we use degrees.
angle_str_part = f"in {int(cell9_angle_deg)}° position"

# Combine all parts into the final string.
final_answer = f"{cell9_shape}. {cell9_dots_str} dots. Arrow {angle_str_part}."

<<<Triangle. 1½ dots. Arrow in 90° position.>>>
