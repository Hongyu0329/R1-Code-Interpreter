    This script simulates the intended arithmetic logic from the obfuscated Javascript code.
    The obfuscated code uses complex patterns to generate numbers.
    For example:
    - The number 2 can be generated by: ! ![]+!![]
    - The number 3 can be generated by: !![]+!![]+!![]
    The script performs the likely intended multiplication to get the final result.
