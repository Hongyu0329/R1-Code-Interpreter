    # Option A
    print("A. Fitting a birth-death model with 10 constant pieces:")

    # Option B
    print("B. Incorporating prior information in a Bayesian framework:")
    print("   - This HELPS. Priors add external information that constrains the possible parameter values, making the estimation more stable and mitigating the identifiability problem.")
    print("-" * 70)

    # Option C
    print("C. Fitting a birth-death model with 10 pieces defined by polynomials of degree 5:")
    print("   - This does NOT HELP. This strategy introduces an enormous number of parameters (120 in total), leading to an overly flexible model. Extreme flexibility exacerbates identifiability issues, making it impossible to find a stable or meaningful solution. This is the opposite of a mitigation strategy.")
    print("-" * 70)

    # Option D & F
    print("D & F. Incorporating fossils (tips and/or sampled ancestors):")
    print("   - This HELPS. Fossils provide direct evidence of past diversity and extinction events. This crucial data breaks the mathematical ambiguity and allows for the separate estimation of λ(t) and μ(t).")
    print("-" * 70)

    # Option E & G
    print("E & G. Reparametrizing the model to infer pulled rates:")
    print("   - This HELPS. Instead of estimating the non-identifiable λ(t) and μ(t), we estimate combinations (like the pulled diversification rate) that have been shown to be identifiable from the data. This is a core strategy for dealing with the issue.")

    print("\nConclusion:")
    print("Strategies B, D, E, F, and G are all valid methods to help with the identifiability problem.")
    print("Strategy A doesn't help, but strategy C is actively counter-productive. By introducing massive over-parameterization, it makes the identifiability problem significantly worse.")
