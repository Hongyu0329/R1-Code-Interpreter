def solve_geology_quiz():
    """
    This function provides the solution to the geology quiz.

    The function evaluates 10 statements about the Cenozoic-Cretaceous geologic history
    of the North American Cordillera, classifying each as either a consensus view ("C")
    or a debated statement ("D").

    The classifications are as follows:
    1. The Morrison formation represents a foredeep deposit. -> C (Consensus)
    2. Metamorphic core complexes formed in response to a slab window. -> D (Debated)
    3. An orogenic plateau ("Nevadaplano") existed in Nevada by the end of the Cretaceous. -> D (Debated)
    4. An orogenic plateau in Arizona ("Arizonaplano") was constructed via magmatic thickening. -> D (Debated)
    5. Laramide-style structures are generally inboard of Sevier-style structures. -> C (Consensus)
    6. The Sierra Nevada and Idaho Batholiths were formed by the ancestral Cordilleran arc. -> C (Consensus)
    7. A series of large-magnitude ignimbrite eruptions began in Idaho/Montana and propagated southwest. -> C (Consensus)
    8. The Colorado Plateau reached modern elevations by the late Cretaceous. -> D (Debated)
    9. The Cascades arc reached modern elevation by the late Oligocene. -> D (Debated)
    10. Laramide-style deformation was caused by subduction of the Shatsky conjugate. -> D (Debated)

    The final answer is the concatenation of these classifications.
