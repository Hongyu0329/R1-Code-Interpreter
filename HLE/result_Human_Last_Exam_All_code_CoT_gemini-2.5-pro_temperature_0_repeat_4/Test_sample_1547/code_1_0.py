    """

    print("### The Argument ###")
    print("The answer is No. Here is the step-by-step reasoning:\n")

    # --- Step 1: The condition implies P_x(tau_A < infinity) = 1 for ALL x. ---
    print("--- Step 1: Analyze the given condition ---")
    print("Let h_A(x) = P_x(tau_A < infinity) be the probability of hitting set A starting from x.")
    print("The given condition is that the set Y = {x in Z^d | h_A(x) = 1} is an infinite set.")
    print("\nThe function h_A(x) has two key properties:")
    print("1. 0 <= h_A(x) <= 1 for all x.")
    print("2. h_A(x) is a discrete harmonic function on Z^d \\ A. This means for any x not in A, h_A(x) is the average of its neighbors' values.")
    print("\nLet's consider any point x_0 in Y. We have h_A(x_0) = 1.")
    print("Since h_A(x) is the average of its neighbors' values and cannot exceed 1, the only way the average can be 1 is if all neighbors also have the value 1.")
    print("This means: if a point is in Y, all its neighbors must also be in Y.")
    print("Since Y is non-empty (it's infinite) and the lattice Z^d is connected, this property implies that Y must be the entire space Z^d.")
    print("So, the initial condition implies a much stronger statement: h_A(x) = 1 for ALL x in Z^d.\n")

    # --- Step 2: h_A(x) = 1 for all x means A is recurrent, not transient. ---
    print("--- Step 2: Connect the condition to the definition of a transient set ---")
    print("A set A is called 'transient' if the expected number of visits to A, starting from the origin (E_0[N(A)]), is finite.")
    print("Let's see what 'h_A(x) = 1 for all x' implies for the number of visits.")
    print("\nFirst, it means the walk is guaranteed to hit A at least once, starting from anywhere: P_x(N(A) >= 1) = 1.")
    print("Now, consider the probability of returning to A, given the walk is already at a point 'a' in A.")
    print("This return probability is P_a(tau_A < infinity), where tau_A = min{n >= 1: S_n in A}.")
    print("This probability is the average of the hitting probabilities from the neighbors of 'a':")
    print("P_a(tau_A < infinity) = (1 / 2d) * sum_{y neighbor of a} h_A(y)")
    print("\nSince we found that h_A(y) = 1 for all y, we can calculate this value.")
    print("Let's use d=3 as an example (the logic holds for any d >= 3):")
    d = 3
    num_neighbors = 2 * d
    print(f"P_a(tau_A < infinity) = (1 / {num_neighbors}) * sum(1 for each of the {num_neighbors} neighbors)")
    print(f"P_a(tau_A < infinity) = (1 / {num_neighbors}) * {num_neighbors} = 1")
    print("\nThis means that once the walk hits A, it is guaranteed to return to A again.")
    print("By the strong Markov property, this process repeats. After each visit, a future visit is guaranteed.")
    print("This implies that the total number of visits to A is infinite, with probability 1.")
    print("So, P_x(N(A) = infinity) = 1 for any starting point x.\n")

    # --- Step 3: Conclusion ---
    print("--- Step 3: Conclusion ---")
    print("If an event happens with probability 1, its expectation cannot be finite (unless it's a constant).")
    print("Since the number of visits N(A) is almost surely infinite, its expectation must be infinite: E_0[N(A)] = infinity.")
    print("This directly contradicts the definition of a transient set (E_0[N(A)] < infinity).")
    print("\nTherefore, a set A with the given property cannot be transient.")
