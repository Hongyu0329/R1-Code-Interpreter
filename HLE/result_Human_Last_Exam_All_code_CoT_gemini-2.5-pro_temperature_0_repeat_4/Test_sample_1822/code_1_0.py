# The formula for the ratio of evidence (E_r) is derived by comparing
# the evidence for a true violation against the evidence for a statistical artifact.

# Calculate the numerator (Evidence for Violation, adjusted by bottleneck factor)
numerator = c * s * beta

# Calculate the final ratio E_r
E_r = numerator / c_prime
