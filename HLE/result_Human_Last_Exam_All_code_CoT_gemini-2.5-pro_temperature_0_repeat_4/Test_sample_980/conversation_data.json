    "Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n1.  First, I need to find the source text from which the sequence of numbers is generated. The prompt itself is the most likely source. The given sequence has 33 numbers. I will look for a contiguous block of 33 words in the prompt. The sentence \"Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\" contains exactly 33 words when punctuation is removed.\n2.  Next, I need to determine the function that maps each word in the source text to the corresponding number in the sequence. I will test several possible functions.\n3.  After trying various functions, I found a plausible one: `f(word) = sum(ord(c) for c in word if c in \"aeiouAEIOU\") % 181`. Let's verify this rule with the first few words and numbers:\n    *   For the first word \"Don't\", the only vowel is 'o'. `sum_vowels = ord('o') = 111`. `111 % 181 = 111`. This matches the first number.\n    *   For the second word \"include\", the vowels are 'i', 'u', 'e'. `sum_vowels = ord('i') + ord('u') + ord('e') = 105 + 117 + 101 = 323`. `323 % 181 = 142`. This matches the second number.\n4.  Although this rule may not hold for the entire sequence, it is the most consistent one I could find that works for the beginning of the sequence. I will proceed with this rule.\n5.  The task is to find the *next* number. This corresponds to the 34th word, which is the word immediately following the identified 33-word text block in the prompt. That word is \"Think\".\n6.  Finally, I will apply the discovered function to the word \"Think\" to calculate the next number in the sequence and construct the final output as requested.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_next_number():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the next number in the sequence based on a rule\n    derived from the prompt.\n    \"\"\"\n    word = \"Think\"\n    vowels = \"aeiouAEIOU\"\n    mod_value = 181\n\n    # Find the vowels in the word\n    vowels_in_word = [c for c in word if c in vowels]\n    \n    # Calculate the sum of the ASCII values of the vowels\n    vowel_sum = sum(ord(c) for c in vowels_in_word)\n    \n    # Apply the formula\n    result = vowel_sum % mod_value\n\n    # Print the equation step-by-step as requested\n    vowel_chars_str = \" + \".join([f\"ord('{c}')\" for c in vowels_in_word])\n    vowel_values_str = \" + \".join([str(ord(c)) for c in vowels_in_word])\n    \n    print(f\"The next word in the sequence is '{word}'.\")\n    print(\"The rule is: (sum of ASCII values of vowels) % 181\")\n    print(f\"Equation: ({vowel_chars_str}) % {mod_value}\")\n    print(f\"= ({vowel_values_str}) % {mod_value}\")\n    print(f\"= {vowel_sum} % {mod_value}\")\n    print(f\"= {result}\")\n\ncalculate_next_number()\n```\n<<<105>>>"
