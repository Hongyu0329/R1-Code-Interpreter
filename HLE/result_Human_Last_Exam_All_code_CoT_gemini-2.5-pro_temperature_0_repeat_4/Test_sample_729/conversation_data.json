    "To find the number of power subgroups in the generalized quaternion group of size 128, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the Group:** The generalized quaternion group of order $2^n$ is denoted as $Q_{2^n}$. For a size of 128, we have $2^n = 128$, which means $n = \\log_2(128) = 7$. So, we are dealing with the group $Q_{128}$.\n\n2.  **Understand Power Subgroups:** A subgroup $H$ of a group $G$ is called a power subgroup if it can be expressed as $H = G^k = \\{g^k \\mid g \\in G\\}$ for some integer $k$. We need to find how many distinct subgroups can be formed this way for $G = Q_{128}$.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Structure of Power Subgroups in $Q_{2^n}$:** The structure of the power subgroups of $Q_{2^n}$ depends on whether the exponent $k$ is odd or even.\n    *   **Case 1: $k$ is odd.** For any odd integer $k$, the set of $k$-th powers of all elements in $Q_{2^n}$ is the group $Q_{2^n}$ itself. So, $G^k = G$. This gives us one power subgroup, the group $G$ itself.\n    *   **Case 2: $k$ is even.** For any even integer $k$, the set $G^k$ forms a cyclic subgroup within the main cyclic subgroup of $Q_{2^n}$. Specifically, for $G = Q_{2^n}$, the power subgroup $G^k$ is a cyclic subgroup of the form $\\langle x^d \\rangle$, where $d$ is an even divisor of $2^{n-1}$.\n\n4.  **Count the Distinct Subgroups:**\n    *   For $Q_{128}$, we have $n=7$. The order of the cyclic subgroup $\\langle x \\rangle$ is $2^{n-1} = 2^6 = 64$.\n    *   The even divisors of 64 are $2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64$.\n    *   Each of these even divisors gives a distinct power subgroup: $\\langle x^2 \\rangle, \\langle x^4 \\rangle, \\langle x^8 \\rangle, \\langle x^{16} \\rangle, \\langle x^{32} \\rangle$, and $\\langle x^{64} \\rangle = \\{1\\}$ (the trivial subgroup).\n    *   This gives a total of $n-1 = 7-1 = 6$ distinct subgroups from the even powers.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Total:** The total number of power subgroups is the sum of the counts from both cases: 1 subgroup from the odd powers ($Q_{128}$ itself) and 6 subgroups from the even powers.\n\nThe following Python code implements this logic to calculate the final number.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef count_power_subgroups_in_q128():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the number of power subgroups in the\n    generalized quaternion group of size 128.\n    \"\"\"\n    group_size = 128\n\n    # For a generalized quaternion group Q_{2^n}, the size is 2^n.\n    # We find n for the given group size.\n    # 2^n = 128\n    n = int(math.log2(group_size))\n\n    print(f\"The group is the generalized quaternion group of size {group_size}, denoted Q_{{{group_size}}}.\")\n    print(f\"This corresponds to the general form Q_{{2^n}} with n = {n}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n    print(\"To find the number of power subgroups, we analyze G^k = {g^k | g in G}:\")\n    print(\"\")\n\n    # Case 1: k is odd\n    num_odd_k_subgroups = 1\n    print(f\"1.
