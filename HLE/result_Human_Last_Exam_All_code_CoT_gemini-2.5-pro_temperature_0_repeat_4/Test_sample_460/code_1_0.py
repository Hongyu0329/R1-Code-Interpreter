    Calculates the smallest integer u based on the given parameters m and t.

    The problem is to find the smallest u such that for all choices of agents
    and their preferences over m items, there exists a suitable subset O.
    A subset O is suitable if:
    1. For any item j in O, more than t agents prefer it over other items in O.
    2. For any item j' not in O, at most u agents prefer it over all items in O.

    The established theoretical result for this problem is that the smallest
    such u is given by the formula u = (m-1) * t.
