    print("The exterior derivative d commutes with pullbacks F*. So, F*(dη) = d(F*η).")

    print("\nStep 2: Structure of an invariant 2-form")
    print("Because the group of symmetries acts transitively, if ω is zero at one point, it must be zero everywhere.")
    print("Thus, ω is either identically zero or it is a volume form (nowhere zero).")
