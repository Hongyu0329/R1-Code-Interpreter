    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the task:\n\nFirst, I will write a Python script to solve the lexicographical string comparison problem. The script will read two strings, convert them to the same case (lowercase) to ensure the comparison is case-insensitive, and then determine if the first string is less than, greater than, or equal to the second.\n\nSecond, as per your request, I will analyze the memory usage for a *memory-efficient C program* designed for this task. This analysis will determine the value of `m`, the total memory in bytes required for the variables in such a program.\n\nThe C program would be designed as follows:\n1.  Declare two character arrays, each with a size of 101, to store the input strings (up to 100 characters plus a null terminator). `char s1[101]; char s2[101];`\n2.  Declare an integer variable `i` to be used as a loop counter.\n3.  Read the two strings from the input.\n4.  Iterate through the strings with the loop counter `i`. In each iteration, compare the lowercase versions of the characters `s1[i]` and `s2[i]`.\n5.  If a difference is found, print `-1` or `1` and terminate. If the loop completes without finding any difference, the strings are equal, and the program prints `0`.\n\nBased on this C program design, the memory usage `m` for the variables is calculated as:\n*   `s1` array: 101 characters * 1 byte/char = 101 bytes.\n*   `s2` array: 101 characters * 1 byte/char = 101 bytes.\n*   `i` loop counter: 1 integer * 4 bytes/int (on a typical system) = 4 bytes.\n*   Total memory `m` = 101 + 101 + 4 = 206 bytes.\n\nHere is the Python code to solve the problem:\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Reads two strings, compares them lexicographically ignoring case,\n    and prints -1, 1, or 0.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        # Read the first string from standard input\n        s1 = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n        # Read the second string from standard input\n        s2 = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n        # Convert both strings to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison\n        s1_lower = s1.lower()\n        s2_lower = s2.lower()\n\n        # Perform the comparison\n        if s1_lower < s2_lower:\n            print(\"-1\")\n        elif s1_lower > s2_lower:\n            print(\"1\")\n        else:\n            print(\"0\")\n\n    except Exception as e:\n        # Handle potential errors, though not expected with problem constraints\n        print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\", file=sys.stderr)\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<206>>>"
