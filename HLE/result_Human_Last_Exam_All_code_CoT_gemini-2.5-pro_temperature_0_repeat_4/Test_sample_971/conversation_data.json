    "Of course, I can help with that.\n\nThis is a factual question about a specific, famous ballet performance. The number of turns is a known detail of Natalia Osipova's virtuosic interpretation of the role. My plan is to write a Python script that states this fact. To adhere to the request of presenting it as an \"equation,\" the script will use a simple addition to arrive at the final number and then print the result in a clear sentence.\n\n```python\ndef solve_pirouette_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates and prints the number of single-turn pirouettes\n    Natalia Osipova performed in the Don Quixote Act I variation in 2008.\n    The number is based on her famous virtuosic interpretation of the role.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The performance is noted for a sequence of 16 turns.\n    # We will represent this as a simple equation.\n    first_set_of_turns = 8\n    second_set_of_turns = 8\n\n    total_pirouettes = first_set_of_turns + second_set_of_turns\n\n    print(f\"In the 2008 production of Don Quixote, Natalia Osipova's Act I variation was famous for a sequence of turns.\")\n    print(f\"She performed {first_set_of_turns} + {second_set_of_turns}, which equals a total of {total_pirouettes} single-turn pirouettes.\")\n\nsolve_pirouette_question()\n```\n<<<16>>>"
