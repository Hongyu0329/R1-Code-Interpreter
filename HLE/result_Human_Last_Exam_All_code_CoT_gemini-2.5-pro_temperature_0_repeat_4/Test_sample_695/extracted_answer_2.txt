Based on the calculations, the net accumulation rates at day 365 are:

PFOS Accumulation Rate Calculation:
= (C_water * Q_gills * AF_gills) + (C_food * IR_food * AF_food) - (kelim * C_fish_365 * M_fish)
= (1.462 ng/L * 100 L/day * 0.8) + (100 ng/g * 20 g/day * 0.9) - (0.069 1/day * 27.782 ng/g * 1000 g)
= (116.979 ng/day) + (1800.000 ng/day) - (1916.979 ng/day)
= 0.000 ng/day

PFOA Accumulation Rate Calculation:
= (C_water * Q_gills * AF_gills) + (C_food * IR_food * AF_food) - (kelim * C_fish_365 * M_fish)
= (118850.402 ng/L * 100 L/day * 0.8) + (100 ng/g * 20 g/day * 0.9) - (0.023 1/day * 413377.511 ng/g * 1000 g)
= (9508032.160 ng/day) + (1800.000 ng/day) - (9507682.752 ng/day)
= 2149.408 ng/day
