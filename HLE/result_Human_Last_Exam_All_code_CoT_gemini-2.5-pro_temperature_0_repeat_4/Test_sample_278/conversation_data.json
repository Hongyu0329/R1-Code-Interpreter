    "To solve this problem, we need to find the dimensions of the smallest rectangle that encloses the given figure, and then determine the smallest square that can contain this rectangle.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Find the range of x-values:** The x-coordinate is given by `x = cos(t)`. As `t` varies over the full interval `[0, 2π]`, the cosine function covers its complete range from -1 to 1. Therefore, the minimum x-value is -1 and the maximum x-value is 1.\n2.  **Find the range of y-values:** The y-coordinate is defined in two parts:\n    *   For `t` in `[0, π]`, `y = sin(t)`. The range of `sin(t)` on this interval is `[0, 1]`.\n    *   For `t` in `(π, 2π)`, `y = 5 * sin(t)`. The range of `sin(t)` on this interval is `(-1, 0]`, so the range of `5 * sin(t)` is `[-5, 0)`.\n    *   Combining these two ranges, the total range for `y` is `[-5, 1]`.\n3.  **Calculate the dimensions of the bounding box:**\n    *   The width of the figure is `x_max - x_min = 1 - (-1) = 2`.\n    *   The height of the figure is `y_max - y_min = 1 - (-5) = 6`.\n4.  **Determine the side of the smallest enclosing square:** The side length of the smallest square that can outcircle the figure must be equal to the larger of its width and height. In this case, `max(2, 6) = 6`.\n5.  **Calculate the area of the square:** The area is the side length squared.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to calculate the final area.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# 1. Define the ranges for x and y\n# For x = cos(t), as t goes from 0 to 2*pi, the range is [-1, 1]\nx_min = -1\nx_max = 1\n\n# For y, we have two cases:\n# Case 1: t in [0, pi], y = sin(t). Range is [0, 1].\n# Case 2: t in (pi, 2*pi), y = 5*sin(t). Range is [-5, 0).\n# The combined range for y is [-5, 1].\ny_min = -5\ny_max = 1\n\n# 2. Calculate the width and height of the bounding box\nwidth = x_max - x_min\nheight = y_max - y_min\n\n# 3. The side of the smallest enclosing square is the maximum of the width and height\nside_length = max(width, height)\n\n# 4. Calculate the area of the square\narea = side_length ** 2\n\nprint(f\"The width of the figure is {x_max} - ({x_min}) = {width}\")\nprint(f\"The height of the figure is {y_max} - ({y_min}) = {height}\")\nprint(f\"The side length of the smallest enclosing square is max({width}, {height}) = {side_length}\")\nprint(f\"The area of the square is {side_length} * {side_length} = {area}\")\n<<<36>>>\n```"
