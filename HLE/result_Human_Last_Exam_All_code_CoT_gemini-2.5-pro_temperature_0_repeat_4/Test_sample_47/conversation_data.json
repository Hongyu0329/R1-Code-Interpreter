    "To solve this problem, we can use a method based on overlaps in the target sequence. The expected number of trials `E` to obtain a specific sequence `S` of length `L` from an alphabet of size `A` is given by the formula:\n\n`E = sum(A^k)`\n\nThe sum is taken over all integers `k` (from 1 to `L`) for which the prefix of the sequence `S` of length `k` is identical to the suffix of `S` of length `k`.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan to calculate the expected time for the sequence \"TENETENET\":\n\n1.  **Identify the parameters**:\n    *   The target sequence is `S = \"TENETENET\"`.\n    *   The length of the sequence is `L = 9`.\n    *   The alphabet is English letters, so the alphabet size is `A = 26`.\n\n2.  **Find all overlaps**: We need to check for each length `k` from 1 to 9 if the prefix `S[0:k]` matches the suffix `S[L-k:L]`.\n    *   `k=1`: \"T\" == \"T\". This is an overlap.\n    *   `k=2`: \"TE\" != \"ET\".\n    *   `k=3`: \"TEN\" != \"NET\".\n    *   `k=4`: \"TENE\" != \"ENET\".\n    *   `k=5`: \"TENET\" == \"TENET\". This is an overlap.\n    *   `k=6`: \"TENETE\" != \"ETENET\".\n    *   `k=7`: \"TENETEN\" != \"NETENET\".\n    *   `k=8`: \"TENETENE\" != \"ENETENET\".\n    *   `k=9`: \"TENETENET\" == \"TENETENET\". The full string is always an overlap.\n\n3.  **Calculate the terms**: The lengths `k` with overlaps are 1, 5, and 9. We need to calculate `26^k` for each of these values.\n    *   `26^1`\n    *   `26^5`\n    *   `26^9`\n\n4.  **Sum the terms**: The expected time `E` is the sum of these values: `E = 26^9 + 26^5 + 26^1`.\n\nThe following Python code will perform these calculations and print the final equation and result.\n\n```python\ndef solve_expected_time():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the expected number of trials to see a specific sequence.\n    \"\"\"\n    sequence = \"TENETENET\"\n    alphabet_size = 26\n    L = len(sequence)\n\n    print(f\"The target sequence is S = \\\"{sequence}\\\" (length L={L}).\")\n    print(f\"The alphabet size is A = {alphabet_size}.\")\n    print(\"\\nWe need to find all lengths k (from 1 to L) where the prefix of S of length k matches the suffix of S of length k.\")\n\n    overlap_lengths = []\n    for k in range(1, L + 1):\n        prefix = sequence[:k]\n        suffix = sequence[L-k:]\n        if prefix == suffix:\n            overlap_lengths.append(k)\n            print(f\"  - For k={k}, prefix '{prefix}' == suffix '{suffix}'.
