# The user wants to solve the Diophantine equation:
# x^7 + (y^3-z^3)x^4 + (y^4+z^4-w^4)x^3+y^7-z^3y^4 + (z^4-w^4)y^3-z^7+w^4z^3 = 0
# for positive integers x, y, z, w.

# Step 1: Factor the equation.
# The equation can be rearranged and factored. Let's analyze its structure.
# Let A = y^3 - z^3
# Let B = y^4 + z^4 - w^4
# The equation can be rewritten by factoring the constant term (the part without x):
# y^7-z^3y^4 + (z^4-w^4)y^3-z^7+w^4z^3 = y^4(y^3-z^3) + (z^4-w^4)(y^3-z^3)
#                                       = (y^3-z^3)(y^4+z^4-w^4) = A*B
# So the full equation is:
# x^7 + A*x^4 + B*x^3 + A*B = 0
# This can be factored by grouping:
# x^4(x^3 + A) + B(x^3 + A) = 0
# (x^4 + B) * (x^3 + A) = 0
# Substituting A and B back gives:
# (x^4 + y^4 + z^4 - w^4) * (x^3 + y^3 - z^3) = 0

# Step 2: Analyze the factors.
# For the product of two terms to be zero, at least one of the terms must be zero.
# This gives us two separate equations to solve:
#
# Case 1: x^3 + y^3 - z^3 = 0  =>  x^3 + y^3 = z^3
# This is an instance of Fermat's Last Theorem for n=3. The theorem states that
# there are no positive integers x, y, z that can satisfy this equation.
# Therefore, this case yields no solutions.
#
# Case 2: x^4 + y^4 + z^4 - w^4 = 0  =>  x^4 + y^4 + z^4 = w^4
# This equation is a known counterexample to Euler's sum of powers conjecture.
# Solutions for this equation do exist. The problem asks for the solution
# (x, y, z, w) with the smallest maximum of {x, y, z, w}. For this equation,
# w will be the largest value, so we are looking for the solution with the smallest w.
#
# The smallest known solution was discovered by Roger Frye in 1988 via a computer search.
# It is believed to be the solution with the smallest possible positive integer values.
# The solution is: 95800^4 + 217519^4 + 414560^4 = 422481^4

# Step 3: Assign the solution and calculate the result.
# Based on this finding, we can set the values for x, y, z, and w.
# The variables x, y, and z are interchangeable.
x = 95800
y = 217519
z = 414560
w = 422481

# The problem asks to output the numbers in the final equation.
