    "Based on the guidelines from the United States Pharmacopeia (USP) Chapter <797> on Pharmaceutical Compounding â€“ Sterile Preparations, I will provide the Beyond-Use Date (BUD) for a single-dose ampule.\n\nMy plan is to create a Python script that:\n1.  Defines variables for the container type, the environment, and the corresponding BUD time limit according to USP <797>.\n2.  Prints a clear and informative statement that explains the BUD for a single-dose ampule opened in a sterile environment.\n3.  The explanation will clarify that while the medication drawn from the ampule has a specific BUD, the opened ampule itself cannot be stored and must be discarded.\n\n```python\ndef get_bud_for_ampule():\n    \"\"\"\n    Provides the Beyond-Use Date (BUD) for a single-dose ampule\n    based on USP <797> guidelines.\n    \"\"\"\n    # According to USP <797>, a sterile environment for compounding\n    # is typically an ISO Class 5 environment.\n    environment = \"ISO Class 5 or better sterile environment\"\n    container_type = \"single-dose container (e.g., an ampule)\"\n    \n    # The BUD for a single-dose container opened in an ISO Class 5 environment.\n    bud_hours = 12\n    \n    # Note: An ampule is a glass container that cannot be resealed after opening.\n    # Therefore, the ampule itself must be discarded immediately after drawing up the medication.\n    # The BUD applies to the medication that has been drawn from the ampule and maintained\n    # in a sterile state (e.g., in a syringe).\n    \n    print(f\"According to USP <797> guidelines:\")\n    print(f\"The Beyond-Use Date (BUD) for the contents of a {container_type}\")\n    print(f\"when opened in an {environment} is up to:\")\n    print(f\"\\n{bud_hours} hours from the time of puncture/opening.\")\n    print(\"\\nImportant Note: An opened ampule cannot be stored and must be discarded immediately after use.\")\n    print(\"The BUD applies to the medication drawn from the ampule, not the opened container itself.\")\n\nget_bud_for_ampule()\n```\n<<<12 hours>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What is the BUD for a single dose container ampule from the time of puncture in a sterile environment? \nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
