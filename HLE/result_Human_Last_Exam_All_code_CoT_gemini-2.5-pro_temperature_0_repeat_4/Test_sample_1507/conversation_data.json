    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of triangular faces on the outer surface of a great icosahedron.\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  Identify the shape of the \"outer-hull\" of a great icosahedron. The outer-hull, or convex hull, of a great icosahedron is a regular icosahedron.\n2.  The question asks for the number of triangles needed to triangulate this outer-hull. A regular icosahedron is a Platonic solid whose faces are already triangles. Therefore, the number of triangles is simply the number of faces of the regular icosahedron.\n3.  We can find the number of faces (F) of a regular icosahedron using Euler's polyhedron formula: `V - E + F = 2`, where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.\n4.  A regular icosahedron has 12 vertices (V) and 30 edges (E).\n5.  By rearranging Euler's formula, we can calculate the number of faces: `F = 2 - V + E`.\n6.  The Python script will perform this calculation and print the result.\n\n```python\n# A great icosahedron's outer-hull (or convex hull) is a regular icosahedron.\n# The faces of a regular icosahedron are already triangles.\n# We need to find the number of faces of a regular icosahedron.\n\n# We can use Euler's formula for polyhedra: V - E + F = 2\n# where V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, and F is the number of faces.\n\n# For a regular icosahedron:\n# Number of vertices (V)\nvertices = 12\n# Number of edges (E)\nedges = 30\n\n# We can rearrange Euler's formula to solve for F: F = 2 - V + E\nfaces = 2 - vertices + edges\n\n# Print the equation and the final result\nprint(\"The number of visible triangles is the number of faces (F) of the outer-hull (a regular icosahedron).\")\nprint(\"Using Euler's formula (F = 2 - V + E):\")\nprint(f\"F = 2 - {vertices} + {edges}\")\nprint(f\"The minimal number of triangles needed is: {faces}\")\n```\n<<<20>>>"
