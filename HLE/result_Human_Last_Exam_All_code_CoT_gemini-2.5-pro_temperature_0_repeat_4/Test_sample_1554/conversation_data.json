    "Of course, I can help with that.\n\nThe user is asking to identify a specific philosopher from the Lviv-Warsaw School based on their conceptual work. The key concepts are the decomposition of \"hallmark\" into \"symptoms\" and \"signals\". This is a factual retrieval task. I will find the correct philosopher and then present the answer in a Python script as requested.\n\n1.  **Identify the Philosopher:** The philosopher known for this distinction is Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz. In his work on epistemology and the philosophy of language, he analyzed different types of signs or indicators.\n2.  **Define the Concepts:**\n    *   **Symptom:** A natural sign that is causally linked to what it indicates (e.g., fever is a symptom of illness).\n    *   **Signal:** A conventional sign whose meaning is established by rules or agreement (e.g., a green light is a signal to go).\n3.  **Create the Script:** I will write a simple Python script that stores the philosopher's name in a variable and then prints a sentence containing the answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_philosopher():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the name of the Lviv-Warsaw School\n    philosopher who distinguished between symptoms and signals.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The philosopher is Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz. He made this distinction\n    # as part of his analysis of signs (or hallmarks).\n    philosopher_name = \"Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz\"\n\n    # The concepts in question\n    broader_notion = \"hallmark\"\n    component_1 = \"symptoms\"\n    component_2 = \"signals\"\n\n    print(f\"The Lviv-Warsaw School philosopher who decomposes the notion of '{broader_notion}' into '{component_1}' and '{component_2}' is:\")\n    print(philosopher_name)\n\n# Execute the function to provide the answer.\nfind_philosopher()\n```\n<<<Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz>>>"
