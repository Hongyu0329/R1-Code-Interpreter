    "To determine the dimension of the Lie group of symmetries of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$, we need to identify all the continuous transformations of time, space, velocity, and pressure that leave the equations unchanged. The dimension of the group is the number of independent parameters that define these transformations.\n\nMy plan is to:\n1.  List the fundamental, finite-dimensional symmetries of the 3D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations.\n2.  For each type of symmetry, determine its dimension (i.e., the number of independent parameters).\n3.  Sum these dimensions to obtain the total dimension of the finite-dimensional part of the symmetry group. Note that the full symmetry group also contains an infinite-dimensional part related to pressure gauge freedom, but the standard question refers to the finite-dimensional part.\n4.  Present this calculation in a Python script that prints the breakdown and the final result.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_navier_stokes_symmetry_dimension():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the dimension of the finite-dimensional Lie group of symmetries\n    for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in R^3.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The symmetry group is composed of several types of transformations.\n    # We sum the dimensions of each component group.\n\n    # 1.
