    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  **Combine the Integrals**: The expression involves the difference of two integrals, $I_1 - I_2$. Since they share the same denominator, I will combine them into a single integral.\n2.  **Simplify the Integral**: I will perform a variable substitution, $u = 1-x$, on the combined integral. This substitution simplifies the integrand significantly. Let's call the resulting simplified integral $I$.\n3.  **Find the Antiderivative**: The crucial step is to find the antiderivative of the simplified integrand. I will look for an antiderivative of the form $F(u) = G(u) \\cdot (\\text{denominator expression})^{1/4}$. By differentiating this form and matching coefficients with the integrand, I can determine the function $G(u)$.\n4.  **Evaluate the Definite Integral**: Using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, I will evaluate the definite integral $I$ by computing $F(1) - F(0)$, where $F(u)$ is the antiderivative found in the previous step.\n5.  **Calculate the Final Expression**: The original expression is of the form $(12)^4 \\cdot (I_1 - I_2)^4$, which simplifies to $(12)^4 \\cdot I^4$. I will substitute the calculated value of $I$ into this expression to find the final numerical answer.\n6.  **Construct the Python Code**: I will write a Python script that prints out each step of this analytical solution, showing how the expression is simplified and evaluated. The script will conclude by printing the final equation with all the numerical components, as requested.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_expression():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the mathematical expression by explaining the analytical steps.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"The problem is to compute the value of the expression:\")\n    print(\"(12)^4 * (integral_1 - integral_2)^4\")\n    print(\"where integral_1 = integral from 0 to 1 of ((1-x)^9 - (1-x)^5 + 1) / (3(1-x)^8 - 4(1-x)^4 + 6)^(3/4) dx\")\n    print(\"and integral_2 = integral from 0 to 1 of x / (3(1-x)^8 - 4(1-x)^4 + 6)^(3/4) dx\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nStep 1: Combine the two integrals.\")\n    print(\"Since the two integrals share the same denominator, we can combine their numerators:\")\n    print(\"integral_1 - integral_2 = integral from 0 to 1 of ((1-x)^9 - (1-x)^5 + 1 - x) / (3(1-x)^8 - 4(1-x)^4 + 6)^(3/4) dx\")\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 2: Simplify the integral with a substitution.\")\n    print(\"Let u = 1-x.
