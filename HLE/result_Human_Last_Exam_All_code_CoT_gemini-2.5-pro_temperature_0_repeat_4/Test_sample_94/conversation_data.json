    "This is a historical question about a specific discovery in physics. My plan is to identify the key elements from your question and use them to determine the correct physicist.\n\n1.  **Physicist known for microscopy:** This narrows the field to a few key figures.\n2.  **Optical effect in real imagery:** The discovery is related to how light forms images.\n3.  **Accidentally observed by a custodial worker cleaning concave mirrors:** This is a very specific and famous anecdote in the history of science.\n\nThese clues point directly to the Dutch physicist **Frits Zernike**. While observing a telescope's concave mirror, he noticed that imperfections on the mirror's surface, highlighted by a cleaning person's work, were visible due to the phase shift of the light they scattered. This led him to develop the phase-contrast microscope, for which he won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1953.\n\nI will now provide a Python script to print his name.\n\n```python\n# The physicist described is Frits Zernike.\n# He developed the phase-contrast microscope after observing an optical effect\n# related to light scattering from a concave mirror.\n# This script will store his name in a variable and print it.\n\nphysicist_name = \"Frits Zernike\"\nprint(physicist_name)\n```\n<<<Frits Zernike>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Which physicist better known for work in the microscopy field discovered an optical effect in real imagery after it was accidentally observed by a custodial worker cleaning concave mirrors?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
