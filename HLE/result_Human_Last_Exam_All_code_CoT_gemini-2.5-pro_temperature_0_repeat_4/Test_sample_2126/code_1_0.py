    Calculates the complex spacetime property by evaluating the derived expression at a small t.

    The full derivation shows the quantity to be calculated is:
    Q(t) = exp(-12*t) * erfi(sqrt(6*t))^2 + exp(-24*t) * erfi(sqrt(12*t))^2
    
    The problem asks for a single numerical value, which suggests taking the limit as t -> 0.
    We can show that lim_{t->0} Q(t) = 0.
    
    The final equation is lim(term1) + lim(term2) = result.
    lim(term1) = lim_{t->0} exp(-12*t) * erfi(sqrt(6*t))^2 = 0
    lim(term2) = lim_{t->0} exp(-24*t) * erfi(sqrt(12*t))^2 = 0
    Result = 0 + 0 = 0.
    
    This code prints the numbers in this final equation.
