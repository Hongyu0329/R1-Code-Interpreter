    "To find the smallest IP access control list entry that matches both networks, we need to perform a process called route summarization or supernetting. The goal is to find the smallest possible network that contains both of the given networks.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  **Convert to Binary:** We will first represent the network addresses in binary format. This allows us to visually identify the common bits between the two networks.\n    *   `172.20.96.0`  -> `10101100.00010100.01100000.00000000`\n    *   `172.20.128.0` -> `10101100.00010100.10000000.00000000`\n2.  **Find Common Prefix:** By comparing the binary representations, we find the longest sequence of matching bits from the left.\n    *   The first two octets (`172.20`) are identical.\n    *   The third octet (`01100000` and `10000000`) differs at the second bit.\n    *   This means the first 17 bits are common to both networks (`10101100.00010100.0`).\n3.  **Calculate Supernet:** The new summary network will have a prefix length equal to the number of common bits, which is `/17`. The network address is found by taking the common bits and setting all subsequent bits to zero.\n    *   Binary: `10101100.00010100.00000000.00000000`\n    *   Decimal: `172.20.0.0`\n4.  **Calculate Wildcard Mask:** The wildcard mask is the inverse of the subnet mask for a `/17` prefix.\n    *   Subnet Mask for /17: `255.255.128.0`\n    *   Wildcard Mask (inverse): `0.0.127.255`\n5.  **Code Implementation:** We will use Python's `ipaddress` library to programmatically perform these steps, ensuring accuracy and automating the calculation. The script will define the two networks, use the `collapse_addresses` function to find the summary route, and then print the resulting network address and wildcard mask.\n\n```python\nimport ipaddress\n\ndef calculate_summary_acl():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the smallest ACL entry (supernet) for a given list of networks.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The input networks from the problem description\n    network_strings = [\n        '172.20.96.0/19',\n        '172.20.128.0/19'\n    ]\n\n    # Convert the string representations into ipaddress network objects\n    networks = [ipaddress.ip_network(net) for net in network_strings]\n\n    # The collapse_addresses function summarizes a list of networks\n    # into the smallest possible list of covering networks.\n    # For these two networks, it will return a single summary network (supernet).\n    summary_list = list(ipaddress.collapse_addresses(networks))\n\n    # The result is the first (and only) network in the summarized list\n    supernet = summary_list[0]\n\n    # The network address of the supernet\n    summary_address = supernet.network_address\n\n    # The wildcard mask is the inverse of the netmask, which the ipaddress\n    # library provides as the 'hostmask' attribute.\n    wildcard_mask = supernet.hostmask\n\n    # Print the final ACL entry in the format: network_address wildcard_mask\n    print(f\"{summary_address} {wildcard_mask}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    calculate_summary_acl()\n```\n<<<172.20.0.0 0.0.127.255>>>"
