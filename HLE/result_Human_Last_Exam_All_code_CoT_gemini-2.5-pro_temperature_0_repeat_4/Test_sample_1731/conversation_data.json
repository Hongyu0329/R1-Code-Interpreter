    "Of course. Here is the plan to solve the task, followed by the Python code to derive and display the results.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **State the Physical System:** We are considering a gas of light quanta (photons), which are bosons. The key properties are that they are indistinguishable and any number of them can occupy the same energy state. Crucially for photons, their total number is not conserved.\n\n2.  **Apply Statistical Mechanics Principles:** The equilibrium state of a system corresponds to the macrostate with the maximum entropy (`S`). This is the core idea connecting thermodynamics to the large deviation principles mentioned (Boltzmann-Sanov). The task is to find the macrostate `{n_i}` (the set of occupation numbers for each energy level `ε_i`) that maximizes the entropy subject to the system's constraints.\n\n3.  **Formulate Entropy:** For bosons, the number of microstates (`W`) for a given macrostate `{n_i}` where `n_i` particles are in `g_i` degenerate states is given by the Bose-Einstein counting formula. The entropy is then `S = k_B * ln(W)`.\n\n4.  **Maximize Entropy:** We will maximize the entropy `S` subject to the single constraint of a fixed total mean energy, `E = Σ_i n_i * ε_i`. We use the method of Lagrange multipliers. This maximization will yield the famous Bose-Einstein distribution for the average occupation number per state, `<n_i> = n_i / g_i`.\n\n5.  **Derive Equilibrium Values:**\n    *   **Mean Energy (E):** Once we have the equilibrium distribution `<n_i>`, we can write the total mean energy `E` by summing the energy contributions from all levels.\n    *   **Entropy (S):** Similarly, we substitute the equilibrium distribution `<n_i>` back into the entropy formula to find the expression for the equilibrium entropy.\n\n6.  **Implement in Python:** A Python script using the `sympy` library will be created to define these physical quantities symbolically. The script will then print the final, derived equations for the equilibrium mean energy and entropy in a clear, readable format.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\ndef derive_bose_einstein_thermodynamics():\n    \"\"\"\n    Derives and prints the equilibrium values for mean energy and entropy\n    for a system of photons (Bose-Einstein statistics) using symbolic math.\n\n    The derivation is based on maximizing the entropy of the system, a principle\n    related to the large deviation theorems mentioned in the problem.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the symbolic variables for the equations.\n    # β (beta) = 1 / (k_B * T) is the inverse temperature, where k_B is the\n    # Boltzmann constant and T is the temperature.\n    # ε_i is the energy of the i-th level.\n    # g_i is the degeneracy of the i-th level (i.e., the number of states at that energy).\n    beta, epsilon_i, g_i, k_B = sp.symbols('β ε_i g_i k_B', real=True, positive=True)\n\n    # --- Step 1: The Bose-Einstein Distribution ---\n    # The equilibrium (most probable) average occupation number <n_i> for a single state\n    # at energy ε_i is found by maximizing the entropy for a system of bosons\n    # with a fixed total energy and non-conserved particle number (the case for photons).\n    # This is the core result from applying the entropy maximization principle.\n    # The average number of particles per state is denoted <n_i> = n_i / g_i.\n    avg_occupation_number = 1 / (sp.exp(beta * epsilon_i) - 1)\n\n    print(\"--- Equilibrium Values for the Bose Case of Light Quanta ---\")\n    print(\"\\nBased on the maximization of entropy, the equilibrium average occupation\")\n    print(\"number for a single state at energy ε_i is given by the Bose-Einstein distribution:\")\n    print(\"\\n<n_i> = n_i / g_i =\")\n    sp.pprint(avg_occupation_number, use_unicode=True)\n    print(\"\\nwhere:\")\n    print(\"  n_i: number of photons in energy level ε_i\")\n    print(\"  g_i: number of degenerate states in energy level ε_i\")\n    print(\"  β: 1 / (k_B * T), the inverse temperature\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    # --- Step 2: Equilibrium Mean Energy (E) ---\n    # The total mean energy of the system is the sum of the energies of all\n    # photons.
