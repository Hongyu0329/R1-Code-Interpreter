    "To calculate the Hopf charge of the given vector field, we will use the Whitehead formula. In this context, the formula can be interpreted as finding the linking number of the preimages of any two distinct points on the sphere S². A preimage of a point `p` on the sphere is the set of all points `(x,y,z)` in 3D space that map to `p`.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n\n1.  **Choose two points on S²**: We will choose the South Pole, `p1 = (0, 0, -1)`, and an equatorial point, `p2 = (1, 0, 0)`.\n2.  **Find the preimage of p1**: We will solve the equations `nx=0, ny=0, nz=-1` to find the set of points `(x,y,z)` that form the first curve, `C1`.\n3.  **Find the preimage of p2**: We will solve the equations `nx=1, ny=0, nz=0` to find the set of points `(x,y,z)` that form the second curve, `C2`.\n4.  **Calculate the linking number**: We will determine the linking number of the two curves, `Lk(C1, C2)`. A simple way to do this is to consider `C1` as the boundary of a surface (a disk) and count how many times `C2` pierces this surface, keeping track of the orientation. The resulting integer is the Hopf charge.\n\nThe following Python script will carry out these steps analytically and print the derivation.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_hopf_charge():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Hopf charge of the given vector field by finding the\n    linking number of the preimages of two points on the S^2 sphere.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
