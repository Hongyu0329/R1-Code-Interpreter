    # The question asks for the *initial* antioxidant response to high temperature stress.
    # In biological systems, sudden environmental stress often leads to the rapid
    # production of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS).

    # Let's analyze the options:
    # A. Liposoluble antioxidants (e.g., Vitamin E, carotenoids in membranes)
    # B. Hydrosoluble antioxidants (e.g., Vitamin C, glutathione in cytoplasm)
    # C. Enzymatic antioxidants (e.g., Superoxide Dismutase (SOD), Catalase (CAT))
    # D. Photosynthetic pigments (e.g., chlorophylls, phycobilins)
    # E. UV-protective compounds (e.g., mycosporine-like amino acids)

    reasoning = """
    The cell's first and most immediate line of defense against a burst of ROS is typically the enzymatic system. Enzymes like SOD and CAT are highly efficient and their activity can be upregulated very quickly to neutralize specific ROS molecules as they are formed. This represents the most rapid, or 'initial', activation.

    Other mechanisms, such as synthesizing new antioxidant molecules (liposoluble or hydrosoluble) or altering the composition of photosynthetic pigments, are generally slower processes and are considered part of a secondary response or longer-term acclimation. Therefore, the enzymatic antioxidants are the ones initially activated.
