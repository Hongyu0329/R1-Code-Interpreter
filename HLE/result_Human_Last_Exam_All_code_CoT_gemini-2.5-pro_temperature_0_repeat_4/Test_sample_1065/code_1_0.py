# This script calculates the coordinates of the center of mass for a string
# lying on a quarter-sphere of radius R, from its top to its edge.

# As derived in the explanation, the horizontal distance from the central axis (r_cm)
# and the vertical height from the base (z_cm) of the center of mass are both given by the formula:
# coordinate = 2 * R / pi

# The problem asks for a raw number, so we assume a unit radius.
R = 1.0

# The final equation for each coordinate is C = (2 * R) / pi.
# The numbers in this equation are 2, R, and pi.
numerator = 2.0
pi_value = math.pi

# Calculate the value of the coordinate.
coordinate_value = (numerator * R) / pi_value

# Print the horizontal and vertical coordinates, separated by a comma.
# The instruction "Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!"
# is interpreted as a requirement to show the components of the final answer, which are the two coordinates.
