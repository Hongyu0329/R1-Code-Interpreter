    Solves for the smallest positive integer n such that P_n is odd.
    P_n is the number of distinct partitions of the vertices of the n x n grid graph
    into 3 sets of equal size, each inducing connected subgraphs.

    The solution is based on a logical argument rather than direct computation,
    as the latter is computationally infeasible.
