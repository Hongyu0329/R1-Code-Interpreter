A tightly secure t-out-of-n threshold signature scheme with a two-round signing protocol can be designed based on the principles of Schnorr signatures. The design involves three main phases: a one-time setup for Distributed Key Generation (DKG) where a shared public key is created and secret shares are distributed; a first signing round where participating members exchange public commitments derived from secret nonces; and a second signing round where members compute and broadcast partial signatures based on the commitments and a shared challenge. The final signature is an aggregation of these partials. This structure is efficient and forms the basis for modern, formally proven schemes like FROST.
