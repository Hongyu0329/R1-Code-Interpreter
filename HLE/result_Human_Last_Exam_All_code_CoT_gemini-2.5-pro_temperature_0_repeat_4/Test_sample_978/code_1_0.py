# This script will print the final answer choice based on the legal analysis.

# The scenario involves two separate incidents of negligence by two different employees.
# The employer, Evergreen Grass Care Ltd., is vicariously liable for the torts
# (negligent acts) of its employees committed within the scope of their employment.

# Incident 1: Mark and the pool
# Mark is directly liable for his negligence.
# Evergreen is vicariously liable for Mark's negligence.
# Therefore, Evergreen and Mark are jointly and severally liable for the pool damage.

# Incident 2: Lincoln and the car
# Lincoln is directly liable for his negligence.
# Evergreen is vicariously liable for Lincoln's negligence.
# Therefore, Evergreen and Lincoln are jointly and severally liable for the car damage.

# The liability for each incident is separate. Mark is not liable for the car,
# and Lincoln is not liable for the pool.

# Evaluating the options:
# A is incorrect because the neighbours are not liable, and Evergreen is liable for Lincoln's actions.
# B is incorrect because liability is not shared among all parties for all damages; it's specific to each incident.
# C is incorrect because Evergreen is also liable for Lincoln's actions.
# D is incorrect because minimal damage does not negate liability.
# E correctly identifies that Evergreen and Mark are liable for the first incident,
# and Evergreen and Lincoln are liable for the second incident.
