    "My plan to identify the radical of the character 謄 is as follows:\n1.  First, I will visually deconstruct the kanji 謄 into its constituent parts. The character is composed of a left part and a right part.\n2.  The left part is 月 and the right part is 朕.\n3.  In kanji with a left-right structure (called hen-tsukuri), the left part is very often the radical (called hen), which indicates the character's general semantic category.\n4.  The radical is therefore the left-side component, 月.\n5.  It's important to note that the radical 月 can represent either \"moon\" (tsuki) or \"meat/flesh\" (niku). When it's a variant of the \"meat\" radical (肉), it is specifically called にくづき (nikuzuki). In the character 謄, this component is the \"meat\" radical.\n6.  The question asks for the Hepburn transcription of the radical's name, similar to how the radical 女 on the left side is called \"Onnahen\". For the radical 肉 on the left side (in the form of 月), the name is \"Nikuzuki\".\n7.  I will write a Python script to print this finding.\n\n```python\ndef find_radical_name():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the name of the radical for the kanji 謄.\n    \"\"\"\n    kanji_character = \"謄\"\n    # The radical is the left-side component 月, which is a form of the 肉 radical.\n    # This form is called にくづき (nikuzuki).\n    radical_name_hepburn = \"Nikuzuki\"\n\n    print(f\"The bushu (radical) in the Japanese character '{kanji_character}' is called: {radical_name_hepburn}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    find_radical_name()\n```\n<<<Nikuzuki>>>"
