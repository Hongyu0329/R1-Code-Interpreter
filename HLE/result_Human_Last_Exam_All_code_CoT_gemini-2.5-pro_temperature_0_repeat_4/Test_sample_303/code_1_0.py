print("Here is the step-by-step analysis to find the error in the Chef script:")
print("1. The script uses an auxiliary recipe, 'Caramel Sauce', to compute Fibonacci numbers. The problem description states this is done recursively.")
print("2. A correct recursive function must have a 'base case' that stops the recursion. For the Fibonacci sequence, the base cases are typically F(0) = 0 and F(1) = 1, which do not involve further recursion.")
print("3. In the 'Caramel Sauce' recipe, the lines 'Serve with caramel sauce' act as the recursive calls.")
print("4. The critical error is that these recursive calls are made unconditionally. There is no conditional logic (like an 'if' statement) to ensure they only execute for n > 1 and not for the base cases.")
print("5. Because the calls are unconditional, the recipe will call itself endlessly, even for n=0 or n=1. This creates an infinite recursion, which is a fatal program error.")
print("6. We must find the option that fixes this. The only option that deals with the erroneous recursive calls is F.")
print("7. Option F is: 'Remove the line \"Serve with caramel sauce.\" from the \"Caramel Sauce\" recipe'. By removing the recursive call from the unconditional part of the recipe, we fix the infinite loop. This is the correct way to handle a base case that incorrectly calls itself.")
print("\nThe Fibonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence relation F(n) = F(n - 1) + F(n - 2).")
print("The numbers in this equation are n, n-1, and n-2.")
