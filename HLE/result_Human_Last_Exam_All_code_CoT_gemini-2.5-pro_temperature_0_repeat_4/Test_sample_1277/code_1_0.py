# --- 2. Calculate Glycan Mass from MS1 data ---
mz_observed = 856.6638
charge = 3
# Calculate the neutral mass of the [M+3H]3+ conjugate
neutral_conjugate_mass = (mz_observed * charge) - (charge * mass_H)
# Calculate the neutral mass of the glycan by subtracting the RFMS tag
glycan_mass_from_ms1 = neutral_conjugate_mass - mass_RFMS

# --- 3. Use MS/MS data to deduce composition ---
# The fragment at m/z 2260.886 is likely a Y-ion from the loss of a single residue.
# Let's calculate the mass of the lost residue.
# A Y-ion is a fragment from the reducing end, so it includes the RFMS tag.
# We assume it's a singly charged ion [M_conjugate - Lost_Residue + H]+
# This is incorrect. A Y-ion is a fragment containing the reducing end.
# A better interpretation is that the fragment at m/z 2260.886 results from the neutral loss of a residue from the parent ion.
# Let's calculate the mass of the part that was lost to produce the Y-ion at m/z 2260.886
# Mass of the Y-ion's glycan component = (m/z_fragment * charge) - mass_RFMS - (charge * H+) is not correct if fragment charge is different.
# Let's assume the fragment at m/z 2260.886 is a +1 Y-ion.
# Mass of the glycan part in this fragment = 2260.886 - mass_H - mass_RFMS = 1885.7039 Da
# Mass of the part that was lost = glycan_mass_from_ms1 - 1885.7039 = 307.0896 Da
# This mass (307.09 Da) is a perfect match for N-Glycolylneuraminic acid (NeuGc).
# The fragment at m/z 673.231 corresponds to [Fuc(1)Hex(2)HexNAc(1)]+, indicating a fucosylated core.

# --- 4. Search for the full composition ---
# We now have strong evidence for Fuc(1) and NeuGc(1).
# We need to find the number of Hex (h) and HexNAc (n) residues.
# Target mass for (h*H + n*N) = glycan_mass_from_ms1 - F - G
sub_target = glycan_mass_from_ms1 - F - G

# Search for the best integer solution for h and n
best_fit = {'h': 0, 'n': 0, 'diff': float('inf')}
for h_count in range(3, 10):  # N-glycans have at least 3 Hex in the core
    for n_count in range(2, 10): # N-glycans have at least 2 HexNAc in the core
        # A common structural rule for complex N-glycans is n >= h - 1
        if n_count < h_count - 1 and h_count > 3:
            continue
        
        current_mass = h_count * H + n_count * N
        diff = abs(current_mass - sub_target)
        
        if diff < best_fit['diff']:
            best_fit['h'] = h_count
            best_fit['n'] = n_count
            best_fit['diff'] = diff

# --- 5. Final Output ---
final_h = best_fit['h']
final_n = best_fit['n']
final_f = 1
final_g = 1

# Calculate the final mass based on the determined composition
