    This function provides the upper-bound for the given mathematical expression based on the provided text.
    
    The problem asks for the upper-bound of ||B * Q_{0,M}||_inf. The provided text is an excerpt from a scientific paper,
    and the direct formula for this bound is not fully contained within the text. The formula relies on concepts
    like the coefficient of ergodicity, which determines a constant 'lambda'.

    Based on the context of the paper this text is from ("Understanding the Expressive Power and Asymptotic
    Behavior of Attention-based GNNs"), the upper-bound can be expressed by the following equation. This bound
    is tighter than the general bound of sqrt(N) because it leverages all the specific assumptions provided (A1-A4)
    and the condition beta > 0.

    The code below will print this equation and explicitly list the numbers it contains, as requested.
