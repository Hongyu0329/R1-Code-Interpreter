    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the SKI Expression:** I will first parse the complex SKI combinator expression. The notation `A(B)(C)` is interpreted as the left-associative application `((A B) C)`.\n2.  **Identify Church Numerals:** I will identify the parts of the expression that represent Church numerals and other known combinators. Key definitions are:\n    *   `I` (Identity) can represent the Church numeral 1.\n    *   `S(I)(I)` represents the Church numeral 2.\n    *   `succ = S(S(K(S))(K))` is the successor function, so `succ(n) = n+1`.\n    *   The application of one Church numeral `m` to another `n`, written as `m n`, corresponds to exponentiation, yielding the Church numeral for `n^m`.\n3.  **Step-by-Step Reduction:** I will evaluate the expression from the inside out, applying the reduction rules of SKI combinators and the properties of Church numerals. This process will simplify the expression until it resolves to a single Church numeral, `n`.\n4.  **Calculate the Final Value:** Once the value of `n` is determined in the form of a power, I will calculate `log_2(n)` using the logarithm property `log_b(x^y) = y * log_b(x)`.\n\nThe Python code below will implement this step-by-step evaluation, explaining each part of the calculation and printing the final equation and result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_church_numeral_log():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script evaluates a complex SKI expression representing a Church numeral 'n'\n    and then calculates log_2(n).\n\n    The expression is: S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(S(S(K(S))(K))(I)))))(S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I))))\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"--- Analyzing the SKI Expression ---\")\n\n    # The expression can be broken down using left-associative application f(g)(h) -> ((f g) h).\n    # The structure is E = A(B)(C) where:\n    # A = S(I)\n    # B = S(I)(S(I)(K(succ(I))))\n    # C = succ(S(I)(I))\n\n    # Step 1: Evaluate C\n    # S(I)(I) is the Church numeral 2.\n    # succ is the successor function.\n    # Therefore, C = succ(2) = 3.\n    C = 3\n    print(f\"Component C = succ(S(I)(I)) = succ(2), which is the Church numeral 3.\")\n\n    # Step 2: Evaluate B\n    # B is a function Î»y.
