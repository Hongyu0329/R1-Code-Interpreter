    "To find a(4), where a(n) is the maximal number of prime implicants of a Boolean function of n variables, we can use a known recurrence relation from the field of switching theory and combinatorics.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  Identify the correct recurrence relation for `a(n)`. The sequence for the maximal number of prime implicants (for non-constant functions) follows the relation:\n    `a(n) = 2 * a(n-1) + C(n-1, floor(n/2))`\n    where `C(n, k)` is the binomial coefficient \"n choose k\".\n2.  Establish the base case. For a function of 0 variables that is not constant 1 (i.e., constant 0), there are no implicants, so `a(0) = 0`.\n3.  Write a Python script to iteratively calculate the values of the sequence `a(1)`, `a(2)`, `a(3)`, and finally `a(4)`.\n4.  The script will then print the final calculation for `a(4)`, showing all the numerical components of the equation as requested.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef combinations(n, k):\n    \"\"\"\n    Helper function to calculate the binomial coefficient C(n, k),\n    also known as \"n choose k\".\n    \"\"\"\n    if k < 0 or k > n:\n        return 0\n    # math.comb is available in Python 3.8+\n    return math.comb(n, k)\n\n# The maximal number of prime implicants, a(n), is calculated using the recurrence:\n# a(n) = 2 * a(n-1) + C(n-1, floor(n/2))\n# with the base case a(0) = 0.\n\n# We compute the sequence up to n=4.\na = {}\na[0] = 0\n\n# Calculate a(1), a(2), a(3)\na[1] = 2 * a[0] + combinations(0, math.floor(1 / 2)) # 2*0 + C(0,0) = 1\na[2] = 2 * a[1] + combinations(1, math.floor(2 / 2)) # 2*1 + C(1,1) = 3\na[3] = 2 * a[2] + combinations(2, math.floor(3 / 2)) # 2*3 + C(2,1) = 8\n\n# Now, calculate the final value for a(4)\nn_final = 4\nprev_a = a[n_final - 1]\nn_comb = n_final - 1\nk_comb = math.floor(n_final / 2)\ncomb_val = combinations(n_comb, k_comb)\na[n_final] = 2 * prev_a + comb_val\n\n# Print the final equation showing each number in the calculation\nprint(f\"a(4) = 2 * a(3) + C({n_comb}, {k_comb}) = 2 * {prev_a} + {comb_val} = {a[n_final]}\")\n```\n<<<19>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    If a(n) is the maximal number of prime implicants of a Boolean function of n variables.
