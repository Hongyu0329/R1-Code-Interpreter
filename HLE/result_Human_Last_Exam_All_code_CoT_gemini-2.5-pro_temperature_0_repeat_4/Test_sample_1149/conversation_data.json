    "This is a factual question based on paleontological findings. The Python code below will store the known number and print the answer.\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  Create a variable to store the number of depressions found in the lacrimal recess of *Irritator challengeri* based on scientific literature.\n2.  Use a `print()` function to output the answer in a clear, descriptive sentence, ensuring the number is explicitly stated.\n\n```python\n# The number of depressions in the lacrimal recess of Irritator challengeri\n# is a known anatomical fact from paleontological studies.\n# This script stores that number and prints it as the answer.\n\nnumber_of_depressions = 2\n\n# The final answer is presented in a sentence.\n# The number '2' is explicitly part of the output string.\nprint(f\"The lacrimal recess in Irritator challengeri contains {number_of_depressions} depressions.\")\n```\n<<<2>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    How many depressions does the lacrimal recess in Irritator challengeri contain?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
