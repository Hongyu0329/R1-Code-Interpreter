    This function determines the minimum value of y (number of Sylow 5-subgroups)
    that guarantees a group G is nonsolvable, given n_3 (number of Sylow 3-subgroups) <= 9.

    Step 1: Analyze the conditions on the number of Sylow p-subgroups (n_p).
    By Sylow's Third Theorem, n_p must be congruent to 1 modulo p.
    - For p=5, y = n_5, so y must be in {1, 6, 11, 16, 21, ...}.
    - For p=3, n_3 must be in {1, 4, 7, 10, ...}. The problem states n_3 <= 9,
      so n_3 can be 1, 4, or 7.

    Step 2: Rephrase the problem.
    We are looking for the minimum y such that NO solvable group exists with
    n_3 <= 9 and n_5 = y.

    Step 3: Test the possible values of y, starting from the smallest.
    - Test y = 1: If n_5 = 1, the Sylow 5-subgroup is normal. A group with a
      normal Sylow p-subgroup is often solvable. For example, the group C_15
      (cyclic group of order 15) is solvable and has n_3 = 1 and n_5 = 1.
      So, y=1 does not guarantee nonsolvability.

    - Test y = 6: This is the next possible value for n_5. It is a known,
      non-trivial result in finite group theory that a group with exactly 6
      Sylow 5-subgroups cannot be solvable.
      Therefore, if a group G has n_5 = 6, it must be nonsolvable.
      This holds true regardless of the value of n_3.
      For example, the alternating group A_5 is nonsolvable (in fact, simple)
      and has n_5 = 6 (though its n_3 is 10, which doesn't meet the n_3 condition).
      The group PGL(2,5) is also nonsolvable and has n_5 = 6.

    Step 4: Conclude the minimum value.
    Since y=1 is ruled out, and y=6 guarantees nonsolvability, the minimum
    such value for y is 6.
    """
    
    # The minimum value of y is determined by the properties of solvable groups.
    # The smallest value of n_5 > 1 that forces a group to be nonsolvable is 6.
    y = 6
    
    print("The problem asks for the minimum value of y such that if n_3 <= 9 and n_5 = y, then G is nonsolvable.")
    print("The possible values for y = n_5 are congruent to 1 mod 5: 1, 6, 11, ...")
    print("For y = 1, a solvable group like C_15 exists with n_3=1 and n_5=1.")
    print("For y = 6, it is a known theorem that any group with n_5 = 6 must be nonsolvable.")
    print("Therefore, y=6 is the smallest value that guarantees nonsolvability.")
    print(f"The minimum value of y is: {y}")
