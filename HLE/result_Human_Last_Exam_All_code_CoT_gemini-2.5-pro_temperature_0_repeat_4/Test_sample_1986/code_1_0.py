# Step 2: Find k_Yuk
# We match the coefficient of the term f_abc * phi*_i^a * psi^biA * lambda_A^c
# From N=4 expansion, the coefficient is k_Yuk.
# From the given N=1 term, the coefficient is sqrt(2).
k_Yuk = sympy.sqrt(2)

# Step 3: Find k_D+F
# First, find the gauge coupling g.
# The standard D-term potential is V_D = (g**2 / 2) * (f_abc * phi*_i^b * phi^ic)**2
# The given term is L_D = (1/2) * (f_abc * phi*_i^b * phi^ic)**2
# Assuming L_D represents V_D, we equate them:
# g**2 / 2 = 1 / 2  => g**2 = 1 => g = 1
g = 1

# Next, find the coefficient of the full N=4 potential.
# The standard N=4 potential Lagrangian term is L_pot = -V_N=4 = -(g**2 / 2) * (f_abc * phi_i^b * phi_j^c)**2
# The problem gives the form L_{F+D} = k_{D+F} * (f_abc * phi_IJ^b * phi_KL^c) * (f_ab'c' * phi^IJ,b' * phi^KL,c')
# This structure corresponds to the standard potential term.
# By comparing the coefficients, we get k_{D+F} = -g**2 / 2
k_D_plus_F = - (g**2) / 2
