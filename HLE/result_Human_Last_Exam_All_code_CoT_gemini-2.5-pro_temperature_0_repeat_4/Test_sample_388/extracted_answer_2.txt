Hello Allison, I see you're picking up your Fluoxetine. I also understand you recently took Excedrin for a headache.

It's important for you to know that taking Fluoxetine together with Aspirin, which is an active ingredient in Excedrin, can increase your risk of bleeding, especially in the stomach.

For future headaches, it would be a safer choice to use a product that only contains acetaminophen (like Tylenol).

Please be sure to watch for any signs of unusual bleeding or bruising, like nosebleeds or dark stools, and contact your doctor if you notice any.
