# Define the variable k
k = sympy.Symbol('k')

# According to the heuristic derivation, the asymptotic behavior of h_k is k^{-4}.
# We can represent h_k as a function of k.
# For the purpose of calculation, we can write h_k = C * k**(-4) for some constant C.
# Let's choose C=1 for simplicity, as it won't affect the final limit calculation.
h_k = k**(-4)

# Now, we calculate the logarithm of h_k.
log_h_k = sympy.log(h_k)

# The problem asks for the limit of (ln h_k) / (ln k) as k approaches infinity.
expression = log_h_k / sympy.log(k)

# Calculate the limit
result = sympy.limit(expression, k, sympy.oo)

# The derivation steps suggest the exponent is -4.
# Let's print the final equation and the result.
# The asymptotic relationship is h_k ~ k^p
# We are finding p = lim_{k->inf} (ln h_k / ln k)
