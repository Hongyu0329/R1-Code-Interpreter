    "To solve this problem, I will first outline the plan for the Python script and the analysis for the C program's memory usage. Then, I will provide the Python code to solve the problem, followed by the final answer for the memory calculation.\n\n### Plan and Analysis\n\n1.  **Python Script Plan:** The task is to reorder the numbers in a sum string (e.g., \"3+2+1\") into non-decreasing order (e.g., \"1+2+3\"). The numbers involved are 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n    *   First, I will read the entire input string.\n    *   Next, I'll split the string by the `+` delimiter to get a list of the numbers as strings.\n    *   Then, I'll sort this list. Since the numbers are single digits, a standard lexicographical sort works correctly.\n    *   Finally, I'll join the sorted list of numbers back into a single string, using `+` as the separator, and print the result.\n\n2.  **C Program Memory Analysis:** The second part of the task is to determine the memory usage (`m`) for the most memory-efficient C program that solves this problem.\n    *   **Strategy:** To minimize memory, the program should not store the entire input string. Instead, it can read the input character by character. It also doesn't need to store the individual numbers. A counting sort approach is ideal: count the occurrences of each number ('1', '2', '3', '4').\n    *   **Variable Sizing:**\n        *   We need four counters, one for each number. The maximum length of the string is 1000, so the maximum count for any number is less than 1000. A `short` integer type (typically 2 bytes) is sufficient to store these counts.\n        *   We need a variable to read input using `getchar()`, which returns an `int` (typically 4 bytes) to handle the `EOF` value.\n        *   For the printing logic, we'll need a loop counter (`int`, 4 bytes) and a flag variable (`int`, 4 bytes) to correctly place the `+` signs.\n    *   **Calculation:**\n        *   Counters: 4 counters × 2 bytes/`short` = 8 bytes.\n        *   Input character variable: 1 × 4 bytes/`int` = 4 bytes.\n        *   Loop counter: 1 × 4 bytes/`int` = 4 bytes.\n        *   Printing flag: 1 × 4 bytes/`int` = 4 bytes.\n        *   **Total memory (m):** 8 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 20 bytes.\n\nNow, here is the Python code to solve the problem.\n\n```python\n# Read the input sum as a string from the user.\n# For example, if the input is \"3+2+1+4\", the variable 's' will hold this string.\ns = input()\n\n# The summands are separated by '+'. We use the split() method to separate the string\n# into a list of numbers. For \"3+2+1+4\", this creates the list ['3', '2', '1', '4'].\nnumbers = s.split('+')\n\n# Sort the list of numbers. For single-digit numbers, lexicographical sorting\n# (alphabetical) is the same as numerical sorting.\n# The list ['3', '2', '1', '4'] becomes ['1', '2', '3', '4'].\nnumbers.sort()\n\n# Join the elements of the sorted list back into a single string, with '+'\n# as the separator between the numbers.\n# The list ['1', '2', '3', '4'] becomes the string \"1+2+3+4\".\nnew_sum = '+'.join(numbers)\n\n# Print the final rearranged sum.\nprint(new_sum)\n```\n<<<20>>>"
