    "To solve the initial value problem, I will follow these steps:\n1.  **Separate the variables:** The given equation $x'(t) = (t-1)x^2(t)$ is a separable differential equation. I will rewrite it as $\\frac{dx}{dt} = (t-1)x^2$ and move all terms with $x$ to one side and all terms with $t$ to the other. This gives $\\frac{1}{x^2}dx = (t-1)dt$.\n2.  **Integrate both sides:** I will integrate the left side with respect to $x$ and the right side with respect to $t$. This will give a general solution with a constant of integration, $C$.\n    $\\int \\frac{1}{x^2}dx = \\int (t-1)dt$\n    $-\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + C$\n3.  **Find the constant C:** I will use the initial condition $x(0)=-8$ to find the value of the constant $C$.\n    $-\\frac{1}{-8} = \\frac{0^2}{2} - 0 + C \\implies C = \\frac{1}{8}$\n4.  **Write the particular solution:** I will substitute the value of $C$ back into the general solution.\n    $-\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + \\frac{1}{8}$\n    To simplify, I can solve for $x(t)$:\n    $x(t) = \\frac{-1}{\\frac{t^2}{2} - t + \\frac{1}{8}} = \\frac{-8}{4t^2 - 8t + 1}$\n5.  **Calculate x(1):** Finally, I will substitute $t=1$ into the particular solution to find the required value. The following Python code will perform this final calculation and print the steps.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\n# The particular solution derived is x(t) = -8 / (4*t^2 - 8*t + 1)\n# We need to find the value of x(1).\n\nt = 1\n\n# Numerator of the expression\nnumerator = -8\n\n# Calculate the terms in the denominator\nterm1 = 4 * (t**2)\nterm2 = -8 * t\nterm3 = 1\n\n# Calculate the denominator\ndenominator = term1 + term2 + term3\n\n# Calculate the final result\n# Using sympy.Rational to keep the result as a fraction\nresult = sympy.Rational(numerator, denominator)\n\n# Print the calculation steps\nprint(f\"The particular solution is x(t) = -8 / (4*t^2 - 8*t + 1).\")\nprint(f\"We substitute t = {t} to find x({t}):\")\nprint(f\"x({t}) = {numerator} / (4*({t})^2 - 8*({t}) + 1)\")\nprint(f\"x({t}) = {numerator} / ({term1} - {abs(term2)} + {term3})\")\nprint(f\"x({t}) = {numerator} / ({denominator})\")\nprint(f\"x({t}) = {result}\")\n```\n<<<8/3>>>"
