    "Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n1.  I will first analyze the biological question, which asks for the most likely mechanism for the retention and divergence of duplicated genes.\n2.  I will evaluate each of the five answer choices based on established principles of molecular evolution.\n    *   **Retention:** The mechanism must explain why both copies of the gene are kept in the genome over evolutionary time, avoiding being lost.\n    *   **Divergence:** The mechanism must explain how the two gene copies become different in their sequence and/or function.\n    *   **Most Likely:** I will compare the valid mechanisms to determine which is considered more probable from a population genetics standpoint (e.g., relying on common vs. rare types of mutations).\n3.  I will write a Python script to automate this evaluation. The script will assign a score to each option based on the criteria above and print a step-by-step analysis.\n4.  The script will conclude by identifying the best option. Subfunctionalization is often considered the most likely initial fate because it can result from common loss-of-function mutations, whereas neofunctionalization requires rarer gain-of-function mutations.\n5.  Finally, I will output the single letter corresponding to the correct answer in the specified format.\n\n```python\ndef solve_gene_duplication_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes different mechanisms for the fate of duplicate genes\n    to determine which is most likely responsible for their retention and divergence.\n    \"\"\"\n    options = {\n        'A': \"Gene conversion\",\n        'B': \"Pseudogenization\",\n        'C': \"Neofunctionalization\",\n        'D': \"Subfunctionalization\",\n        'E': \"Adaptive radiation\"\n    }\n\n    analysis_results = {\n        'A': {\n            'description': \"This mechanism homogenizes gene copies, making them more similar.
