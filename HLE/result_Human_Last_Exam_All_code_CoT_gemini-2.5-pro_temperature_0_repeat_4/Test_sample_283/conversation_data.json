    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of submatrix multiplications that occur when multiplying two matrices represented by a Hierarchical Semi-separable (HSS) tree structure of depth 4.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Understand HSS Matrix Multiplication:** An HSS matrix is partitioned recursively. A matrix `M` corresponding to a node in the HSS tree is split into a 2x2 block matrix:\n    ```\n    M = [[M_11, M_12],\n         [M_21, M_22]]\n    ```\n    The multiplication of two such matrices, `C = A * B`, is also a 2x2 block matrix multiplication:\n    ```\n    C_11 = A_11*B_11 + A_12*B_21\n    C_12 = A_11*B_12 + A_12*B_22\n    C_21 = A_21*B_11 + A_22*B_21\n    C_22 = A_21*B_12 + A_22*B_22\n    ```\n    This results in 8 smaller matrix multiplications and 4 matrix additions for each internal node in the tree.\n\n2.  **Formulate a Recurrence Relation:** Let `M(d)` be the total number of submatrix multiplications for an HSS tree of depth `d`.\n    *   The two diagonal block products (`A_11*B_11` and `A_22*B_22`) are recursive HSS multiplications on sub-trees of depth `d-1`. This contributes `2 * M(d-1)` to the total count.\n    *   The other 6 products involve off-diagonal blocks, which are represented in a compressed low-rank format. These are still considered submatrix multiplications in this context.\n    *   This gives us the recurrence relation: `M(d) = 2 * M(d-1) + 6`.\n\n3.  **Define the Base Case:** For a tree of depth `d=1`, the tree consists of a single node (a leaf), which represents a dense matrix. The multiplication is just one operation. So, `M(1) = 1`.\n\n4.  **Calculate for Depth 4:** We will use the recurrence relation and the base case to calculate the number of multiplications for `d=2`, `d=3`, and finally `d=4`. The term \"submatrices accessed\" is interpreted as the number of these fundamental multiplication operations.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to calculate the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_hss_multiplication():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of submatrix multiplications for an HSS matrix\n    multiplication with a tree of a given depth.\n    \"\"\"\n    depth = 4\n    print(f\"Calculating the number of submatrix multiplications for an HSS tree of depth {depth}.\")\n    print(\"The recurrence relation is M(d) = 2 * M(d-1) + 6, where d is the depth.\\n\")\n\n    # Base case: For a tree of depth d=1 (a single leaf), there is 1 multiplication.\n    m_prev = 1\n    print(f\"Base Case: For a tree of depth 1, the number of multiplications M(1) = {m_prev}\")\n\n    # Apply the recurrence relation for d = 2, 3, 4\n    for d in range(2, depth + 1):\n        m_curr = 2 * m_prev + 6\n        print(f\"Step d={d}: M({d}) = 2 * M({d-1}) + 6 = 2 * {m_prev} + 6 = {m_curr}\")\n        m_prev = m_curr\n\n    final_answer = m_prev\n    print(f\"\\nThus, for a Hierarchical Semi-separable tree with depth 4, a total of {final_answer} submatrix multiplications are performed.\")\n\nsolve_hss_multiplication()\n```\n<<<50>>>"
