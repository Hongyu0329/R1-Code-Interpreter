    # The core problem in sheet metal forming is managing the flow of material into the die.
    # - Too much material flow causes wrinkling (compressive stress).
    # - Too little material flow causes excessive thinning and tearing (tensile stress).

    # "Bypass notches" are features added to the blank's periphery to control this flow.
    # - Negative notches (cutouts) restrict flow to prevent wrinkles.
    # - Positive notches (tabs) encourage flow to prevent tearing.

    # This control is especially critical around complex geometries (e.g., sharp corners, deep sections)
    # where material flow is naturally uneven.

    # Let's evaluate the options based on this understanding:
    # A. Wrinkles: A correct symptom, but not the root cause.
    # D. Material inflow issues: This is the root cause. Controlling inflow prevents both wrinkles and tearing.
    # I. Excessive thinning: Another correct symptom, but not the root cause.

    # Option D is the most comprehensive and fundamental reason. It describes the underlying
    # mechanism (controlling material inflow) that is used to prevent the problems
    # described in A and I.
