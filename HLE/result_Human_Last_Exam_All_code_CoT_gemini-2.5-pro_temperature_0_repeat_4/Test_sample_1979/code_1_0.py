    print("A+A = {a+b | a, b in A} is a set of integers.")
    print("A x A = {(a,b) | a, b in A} is a set of ordered pairs.")

    print("The smallest element in A*A is a_1 * a_1 = a_1^2.")
    print("So, we must have 2*a_1 >= a_1^2, which simplifies to 2 >= a_1 (since a_1 > 0).")

    print("This leads to the inequality: 2 + a_2 >= 2*a_2, which implies 2 >= a_2.")
    print("This contradicts our assumption that a_2 > 2. Thus, no such set A exists with |A|>1 and min(A)=2.")

    print("For example, for A={1,2,3}, A+A={2,3,4,5,6} and A*A={1,2,3,4,6,9}. The sum 5 is not in A*A, so it's not a valid set.")
