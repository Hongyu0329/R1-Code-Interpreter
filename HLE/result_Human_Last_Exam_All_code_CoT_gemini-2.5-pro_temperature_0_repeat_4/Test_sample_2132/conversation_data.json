    "To determine the Böttcher Molecular Complexity of the product of the Favorskii rearrangement of 2-chlorocyclohexanone, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the Product:** The Favorskii rearrangement of an α-halo ketone, such as 2-chlorocyclohexanone, in the presence of a base leads to a ring contraction. The six-membered cyclohexanone ring rearranges to form a five-membered ring with a carboxylic acid group. The product is cyclopentanecarboxylic acid (C₆H₁₀O₂).\n\n2.  **Define Böttcher Molecular Complexity:** This complexity index is calculated using the formula:\n    `C = N * (N_b / N_a)²`\n    Where:\n    *   `N`: Total number of non-hydrogen atoms in the molecule.\n    *   `N_b`: Number of non-hydrogen atoms in the cyclic parts of the molecule.\n    *   `N_a`: Number of non-hydrogen atoms in the acyclic (non-ring) parts of the molecule.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Parameters for Cyclopentanecarboxylic Acid:**\n    *   **N (Total non-hydrogen atoms):** The molecule has 6 carbon atoms and 2 oxygen atoms. So, `N = 6 + 2 = 8`.\n    *   **N_b (Cyclic atoms):** The cyclopentane ring consists of 5 carbon atoms. So, `N_b = 5`.\n    *   **N_a (Acyclic atoms):** The acyclic carboxylic acid group (-COOH) consists of 1 carbon atom and 2 oxygen atoms. So, `N_a = 1 + 2 = 3`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Complexity:** We will now substitute these values into the formula and compute the result using a Python script.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Define the parameters for cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n\n# N: Total number of non-hydrogen atoms (6 carbons + 2 oxygens)\nN = 8\n\n# N_b: Number of non-hydrogen atoms in the cyclic part (5 carbons in the cyclopentane ring)\nN_b = 5\n\n# N_a: Number of non-hydrogen atoms in the acyclic part (1 carbon and 2 oxygens in the -COOH group)\nN_a = 3\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the Böttcher Molecular Complexity using the formula C = N * (N_b / N_a)^2.\nbottcher_complexity = N * (N_b / N_a)**2\n\n# Step 3: Print the final equation and the result.\nprint(\"The Böttcher Molecular Complexity (C) is calculated as follows:\")\nprint(f\"C = N * (N_b / N_a)^2\")\nprint(f\"C = {N} * ({N_b} / {N_a})^2\")\nprint(f\"C = {bottcher_complexity:.3f}\")\n```\n<<<22.222>>>"
