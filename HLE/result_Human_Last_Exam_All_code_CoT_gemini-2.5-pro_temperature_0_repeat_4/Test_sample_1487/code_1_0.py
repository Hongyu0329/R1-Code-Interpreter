# The problem asks to find the value of the expression:
# (2 * ||alpha||^2) / (pi^2/6 - 1) + 10^15
#
# Based on the mathematical derivation, the squared norm of the vector alpha is:
# ||alpha||^2 = (1/2) * (pi^2/6 - 1)
#
# When we substitute this into the expression, the term (pi^2/6 - 1) cancels out.
# The first part of the expression simplifies to:
# (2 * (1/2) * (pi^2/6 - 1)) / (pi^2/6 - 1) = 1
#
# Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 1 + 10^15.

# The first number in the final simplified equation
first_number = 1

# The second number in the final simplified equation
second_number = 10**15

# The final result of the addition
final_result = first_number + second_number

# As requested, we print each number in the final equation.
print(f"{first_number} + {second_number} = {final_result}")
