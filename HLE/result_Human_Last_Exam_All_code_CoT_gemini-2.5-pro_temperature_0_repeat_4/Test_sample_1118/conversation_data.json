    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to find the answer:\n\n1.  First, I will identify the specific self-portrait painted by Curt Querner in 1933. The context provided (after escaping the Gestapo) is key to pinpointing the correct artwork.\n2.  Next, I will research the details and art-historical analysis of this painting, specifically looking for descriptions of what the artist is holding.\n3.  Finally, I will determine the symbolic meaning of the object he holds, particularly in the context of resistance against the Nazi regime.\n4.  I will then present this information in a Python script.\n\n```python\ndef find_symbol_of_resistance():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides information about Curt Querner's 1933 self-portrait.\n    \"\"\"\n    artist = \"Curt Querner\"\n    year = 1933\n    context = \"after a brief arrest by the Gestapo\"\n    symbolic_object = \"a red cloth\"\n    meaning = \"a symbol of his leftist political beliefs and resistance\"\n\n    print(f\"In {year}, {artist} painted a self-portrait {context}.\")\n    print(f\"In his hand, he holds {symbolic_object}.\")\n    print(f\"This object is interpreted as {meaning}.\")\n\nfind_symbol_of_resistance()\n```\n<<<a red cloth>>>"
