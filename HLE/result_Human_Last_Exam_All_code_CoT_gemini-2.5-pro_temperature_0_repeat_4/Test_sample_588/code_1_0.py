    This function solves the mathematical puzzle presented.

    The problem asks for the lexicographically least tuple (a_1, b_1, ..., a_l, b_l),
    with l minimal, such that no M(a_i, b_i) is full, yet their connect-sum is full.

    1. A manifold is "full" if its tangent Stiefel-Whitney classes w_k are all 0 for k>0.
       This is equivalent to the total Stiefel-Whitney class w(TM) being 1.

    2. The manifold M(g), a closed orientable surface of genus g, is a 2-manifold.
       - w_1(M(g)) = 0 because it's orientable.
       - w_2(M(g)) is the mod 2 reduction of the Euler class. The Euler characteristic is
         chi(M(g)) = 2 - 2g, which is always even. Thus, w_2(M(g)) = 0.
       - So, w(M(g)) = 1 for all g. All M(g) are full.

    3. The manifold M(a,b) = M(a) x M(b) is a 4-manifold.
       - By the Whitney product formula, w(M(a,b)) = w(M(a)) * w(M(b)).
       - Since w(M(a)) = 1 and w(M(b)) = 1, it follows that w(M(a,b)) = 1.
       - Therefore, all manifolds M(a,b) are full.

    4. The problem requires us to find a list of M(a_i, b_i) that are *not* full.
       Since all M(a,b) are full, this condition cannot be satisfied for any M(a,b).

    5. The only way to satisfy the condition "no M(a_i, b_i) is full" is if the list
       of such manifolds is empty. This corresponds to l=0. In this case, the
       condition is vacuously true.

    6. If l=0, the connect-sum is, by convention, the 4-sphere S^4.
       The manifold S^4 is full (as w(TS^4) = 1).

    7. Thus, l=0 is the minimal length, and the corresponding tuple is the empty tuple.
