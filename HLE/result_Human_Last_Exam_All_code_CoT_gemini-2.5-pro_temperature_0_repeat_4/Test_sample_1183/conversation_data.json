    "To determine the symmetry group of the molecule, we will use a computational approach. The plan is as follows:\n\n1.  **Parse the SMILES String**: We will use the `rdkit` library, a powerful toolkit for cheminformatics, to read the provided SMILES string (`C#Cc1cc2ccc3c(C#C)cc4ccc5c(C#C)cc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67`) and create a digital representation of the molecule.\n\n2.  **Generate 3D Coordinates**: Symmetry is a property of a molecule's 3D shape. We will instruct `rdkit` to generate a 3D conformation for the molecule. Then, we'll use a molecular mechanics force field (UFF) to optimize the geometry, finding a stable, low-energy structure. Given the molecule's composition of spÂ² and sp hybridized carbons, we expect the final structure to be planar.\n\n3.  **Identify the Point Group**: With the optimized 3D coordinates, we will use the `pyscf` library, a suite for quantum chemistry calculations. It contains a function specifically designed to analyze atomic coordinates and determine the molecule's point group based on its symmetry elements (like rotation axes and mirror planes).\n\n4.  **Output the Result**: The script will print the identified symmetry group. Based on the molecule's trigonal and planar structure, the expected point group is D3h.\n\nThis process automates the task of visualizing and analyzing the complex molecular structure to find its symmetry.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# This script requires the RDKit and PySCF libraries.\n# You can install them using pip:\n# pip install rdkit pyscf\n\ntry:\n    from rdkit import Chem\n    from rdkit.Chem import AllChem\nexcept ImportError:\n    print(\"Error: RDKit library not found.\")\n    print(\"Please install it using: pip install rdkit\")\n    sys.exit(1)\n\ntry:\n    from pyscf import gto\n    from pyscf.symm import addons\nexcept ImportError:\n    print(\"Error: PySCF library not found.\")\n    print(\"Please install it using: pip install pyscf\")\n    sys.exit(1)\n\ndef find_molecule_point_group(smiles_string: str):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the point group of a molecule from its SMILES string.\n\n    Args:\n        smiles_string: The SMILES representation of the molecule.\n\n    Returns:\n        The Schoenflies symbol of the point group as a string, or None on failure.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(f\"Analyzing SMILES: {smiles_string}\")\n\n    # Step 1: Create molecule from SMILES and add hydrogens for realistic geometry\n    mol = Chem.MolFromSmiles(smiles_string)\n    if not mol:\n        print(\"Error: Failed to parse SMILES string.\")\n        return None\n    mol = Chem.AddHs(mol)\n\n    # Step 2: Generate a 3D structure and optimize it\n    print(\"Generating 3D structure...\")\n    # Use a reproducible random seed for embedding\n    status = AllChem.EmbedMolecule(mol, randomSeed=42)\n    if status == -1:\n        print(\"Warning: RDKit failed to generate an initial 3D conformation.
