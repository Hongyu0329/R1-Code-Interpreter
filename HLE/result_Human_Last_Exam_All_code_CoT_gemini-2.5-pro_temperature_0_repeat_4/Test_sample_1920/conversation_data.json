    "To find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters $\\chi$ of conductor $d=53599$ and order 6, we can follow these steps:\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Factorize the conductor `d`**: The structure of the group of Dirichlet characters modulo `d` depends on the prime factorization of `d`.\n2.  **Understand Primitive Characters for this `d`**: A character $\\chi$ modulo $d = p_1 p_2 \\cdots p_r$ (a square-free integer) is a product of characters $\\chi_i$ modulo each prime factor $p_i$, i.e., $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\cdots \\chi_r$. The character $\\chi$ is primitive if and only if each component character $\\chi_i$ is primitive. For a prime modulus $p_i$, a character is primitive if and only if it's not the trivial character (i.e., its order is greater than 1).\n3.  **Condition on the Order**: The order of the character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its components. We need this lcm to be 6. Let $g_i$ be the order of $\\chi_i$. We require $\\text{lcm}(g_1, g_2, \\dots, g_r) = 6$.\n4.  **Count Component Characters**: For each prime factor $p_i$ of $d$, we need to count the number of available primitive characters $\\chi_i$ whose orders are divisors of 6 (i.e., orders 2, 3, 6). The number of characters of order $g$ modulo a prime $p$ is given by Euler's totient function, $\\phi(g)$, provided that $g$ divides $p-1$.\n5.  **Combine the Counts**: We will use a combinatorial approach (specifically, the principle of inclusion-exclusion) to count the number of combinations of component characters $(\\chi_1, \\dots, \\chi_r)$ such that the lcm of their orders is exactly 6.\n    *   Total combinations where all orders $g_i$ divide 6.\n    *   Subtract combinations where all orders $g_i$ divide 2 (lcm would be 1 or 2).\n    *   Subtract combinations where all orders $g_i$ divide 3 (lcm would be 1 or 3).\n    *   The result is the number of combinations where the lcm is exactly 6.\n\nNow, let's execute this plan with a Python script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef get_prime_factorization(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns a dictionary of prime factors of n.\n    \"\"\"\n    factors = {}\n    d = 2\n    temp = n\n    while d * d <= temp:\n        while (temp % d) == 0:\n            factors[d] = factors.get(d, 0) + 1\n            temp //= d\n        d += 1\n    if temp > 1:\n       factors[temp] = factors.get(temp, 0) + 1\n    return factors\n\ndef phi(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates Euler's totient function phi(n).\n    \"\"\"\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    result = n\n    p = 2\n    temp = n\n    while p * p <= temp:\n        if temp % p == 0:\n            while temp % p == 0:\n                temp //= p\n            result -= result // p\n        p += 1\n    if temp > 1:\n        result -= result // temp\n    return int(result)\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the problem of finding the number of primitive Dirichlet characters\n    of a given conductor and order.\n    \"\"\"\n    d = 53599\n    required_order = 6\n\n    print(f\"Finding the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor d = {d} and order {required_order}.\")\n    \n    # Step 1: Factorize the conductor d\n    factors = get_prime_factorization(d)\n    primes = sorted(list(factors.keys()))\n    print(f\"\\nStep 1: The prime factorization of d is {d} = {' * '.join(map(str, primes))}.\")\n    \n    # For a square-free conductor, a character is primitive iff its components are non-trivial (order > 1).\n    print(\"Since d is square-free, a character is primitive if its components for each prime factor are non-trivial.\")\n\n    # Step 2 & 3: Count available component characters\n    print(f\"\\nStep 2: For each prime factor p, count primitive characters whose orders divide {required_order}.\")\n    print(\"The order of a component character must be > 1.
