    "This is a classic organic chemistry problem involving a two-step synthesis. The reaction is a directed ortho-metalation followed by an electrophilic quench. Here is my plan to determine the final product:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Starting Material**: The starting compound is N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide. I will identify the functional groups on the benzene ring, which are an N,N-diethylcarboxamide group (`-C(=O)N(Et)2`) and a dimethylamino group (`-N(Me)2`).\n2.  **Analyze Step 1 (Directed ortho-Metalation)**: The reagents are sec-BuLi (a strong base) and TMEDA (a chelating agent). This combination is used for directed ortho-metalation (DoM), where the base is directed to remove a proton from the position *ortho* (adjacent) to a directing group. I will determine which proton on the benzene ring is the most acidic by considering the directing effects of both the carboxamide and amino groups. The position that is ortho to both groups will be the most activated site for deprotonation.\n3.  **Analyze Step 2 (Electrophilic Quench)**: The intermediate from Step 1, an aryllithium species, is a strong nucleophile. It will react with the added electrophile, methyl iodide (`CH3I`). The nucleophilic carbanion will attack the methyl group, displacing the iodide ion.\n4.  **Determine the Final Product**: By combining these steps, I will determine the structure of the final product and provide its chemical name.\n\nThe following Python script executes this plan and prints a detailed explanation of the reaction, along with the final product's name and structure.\n\n```python\ndef solve_reaction():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes a two-step organic synthesis and determines the final product.\n    \"\"\"\n    # --- Define the reaction components ---\n    starting_material = \"N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide\"\n    reagents_step1 = \"sec-BuLi and TMEDA in THF\"\n    reagent_step2 = \"methyl iodide (CH3I)\"\n\n    print(\"--- Predicting the Product of a Two-Step Synthesis ---\")\n    print(f\"\\nStarting Material: {starting_material}\")\n    print(f\"Step 1 Reagents: {reagents_step1}\")\n    print(f\"Step 2 Reagent: {reagent_step2}\")\n\n    print(\"\\n--- Step-by-Step Chemical Analysis ---\")\n\n    # --- Step 1: Directed ortho-Metalation ---\n    print(\"\\nStep 1: Reaction with sec-BuLi and TMEDA\")\n    print(\"  - The starting material has two key functional groups on a benzene ring:\")\n    print(\"    - An N,N-diethylcarboxamide group [-C(=O)N(Et)2] at position 1.\")\n    print(\"    - A dimethylamino group [-N(Me)2] at position 3.\")\n    print(\"  - Both of these are 'Directed Metalation Groups' (DMGs).
