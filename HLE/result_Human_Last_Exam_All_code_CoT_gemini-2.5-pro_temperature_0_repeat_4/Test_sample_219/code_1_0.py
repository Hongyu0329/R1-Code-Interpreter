# Step 1: Define the signs for each path based on biological reasoning.
# A positive sign (+) indicates that an increase in the source variable causes an increase in the target variable.
# A negative sign (-) indicates that an increase in the source variable causes a decrease in the target variable.

# Path C -> a -> F: Nectar caffeine -> Flower level foraging duration
# Reasoning: Caffeine can enhance the perceived reward, making pollinators stay longer.
sign_a = '+'

# Path F -> b -> Y: Flower level foraging duration -> Total yield
# Reasoning: Longer foraging on a flower leads to better pollination and thus higher yield.
sign_b = '+'

# Path C -> c -> R: Nectar caffeine -> Pollinator retention
# Reasoning: Caffeine enhances pollinator memory, making them more likely to return.
sign_c = '+'

# Path R -> d -> Y: Pollinator retention -> Total yield
# Reasoning: Higher retention means more visits and more overall pollination, increasing yield.
sign_d = '+'

# Path C -> e -> Y: Nectar caffeine -> Total yield (direct effect)
# Reasoning: Caffeine can act as a defense chemical, protecting the plant and leading to higher yield.
sign_e = '+'

# Step 2: Print the final set of signs for the proposed equation.
# The "equation" here is the set of relationships in the path diagram.
print("The most likely set of signs for each path is:")
