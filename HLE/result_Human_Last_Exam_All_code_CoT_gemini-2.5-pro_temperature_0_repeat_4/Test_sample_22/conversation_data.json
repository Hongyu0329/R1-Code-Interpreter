    "The statement is True. Here is a step-by-step explanation:\n\n1.  **SNP Heritability (h²_snp):** This represents the proportion of phenotypic variance in a population that is explained by the additive effects of a specific set of SNPs (e.g., all common SNPs on a genotyping chip). It is a theoretical, population-level parameter that represents the *maximum possible* predictive power you could ever achieve using a linear model of just those SNPs. It's the \"ceiling\" or the upper bound.\n\n2.  **Polygenic Score (PGS):** A PGS is a practical tool built to *estimate* an individual's genetic predisposition for a phenotype. It is constructed using effect sizes (weights) for SNPs that are themselves estimated from a Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS).\n\n3.  **Predictive Ability (R²):** The predictive ability of a PGS is measured by its R-squared (R²) value, which is the proportion of variance it explains when applied to a *new, independent* dataset (i.e., a sample not used to create the PGS).\n\n4.  **Why R² < h²_snp:** The predictive ability (R²) of a PGS is almost always lower than the SNP heritability (h²_snp) for several key reasons:\n    *   **Finite GWAS Sample Size:** The SNP effect sizes used to build the PGS are *estimates*, not the true values. Because the GWAS discovery sample is finite, these estimates contain statistical noise/error. This error reduces the accuracy of the final PGS.\n    *   **Imperfect LD Modeling:** The methods used to build a PGS must account for Linkage Disequilibrium (LD), the correlation between nearby SNPs. This is a complex problem, and current methods are not perfect.\n    *   **Population Differences:** The PGS may be less accurate if the genetic ancestry or LD structure of the target sample differs from the GWAS discovery sample.\n\nIn essence, SNP heritability is the theoretical potential, while the PGS's R-squared is the actual, realized performance. Due to real-world statistical limitations, the realized performance will necessarily be lower than the theoretical potential.\n\n```python\ndef explain_pgs_heritability():\n    \"\"\"\n    Explains the relationship between SNP heritability and Polygenic Score (PGS) predictive ability.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the concepts\n    snp_heritability_explanation = \"SNP heritability (h²_snp) is the theoretical upper limit of phenotypic variance that can be explained by a set of SNPs.\"\n    pgs_r_squared_explanation = \"A Polygenic Score's predictive ability (R²) is the actual variance explained in a new sample using a model built from GWAS data.\"\n\n    # Explain the relationship\n    relationship_explanation = \"The PGS R² is necessarily lower than h²_snp because the PGS is built with estimated, not true, SNP effects from a finite-sized GWAS.
