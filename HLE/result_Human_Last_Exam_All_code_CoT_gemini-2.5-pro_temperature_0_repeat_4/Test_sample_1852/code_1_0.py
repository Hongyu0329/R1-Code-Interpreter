    # Based on the analysis, the set X contains all regular cardinals lambda
    # for which a tower of length lambda exists.

    # Lower bound for lambda in X:
    # Due to the distributivity of the algebra P(omega_1)/Fin_{omega_1},
    # any tower length lambda must be greater than omega_1.
    # Since lambda is a regular cardinal, lambda must be at least omega_2.
    # So, inf(X) >= omega_2.
    
    # Upper bound for lambda in X:
    # The length of a tower is bounded by the size of the algebra, which is 2^(omega_1).
    # Given 2^(omega_1) = omega_2, any lambda in X must be <= omega_2.

    # Combining the bounds, any lambda in X must be omega_2.
    # The existence of a tower of length omega_2 is guaranteed by the theorem
    # t(omega_1) <= 2^(omega_1), which means t(omega_1) = omega_2.
    # Therefore, the set X is exactly {omega_2}.
