    "In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare (or non-interacting) Green's function, $G_0$, describes the propagation of a single particle without any interactions. When we transform from the time domain to the frequency-momentum domain, the relationship between the Green's function and the single-particle energy eigenvalues becomes very simple and clear.\n\nThe functional dependence of the bare Green's function $G_0(\\mathbf{k}, \\omega)$ on the single-particle energy eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$ for a given momentum $\\mathbf{k}$ and frequency (energy) $\\omega$ is given by:\n\n$G_0(\\mathbf{k}, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\eta}$\n\nHere's a breakdown of the terms:\n-   **$G_0(\\mathbf{k}, \\omega)$**: The bare Green's function in frequency-momentum space.\n-   **$\\omega$**: The frequency (or energy) of the particle being propagated.\n-   **$\\epsilon_k$**: The energy eigenvalue of the single-particle state with momentum $\\mathbf{k}$. This is the energy the particle would have if it were a non-interacting eigenstate of the system.\n-   **$i\\eta$**: An infinitesimally small positive imaginary term ($ \\eta \\to 0^+ $). This term is crucial for ensuring causality; it correctly defines the contour of integration in the complex plane and ensures that particles propagate forward in time.\n\nEssentially, the Green's function has a pole (it diverges) when the external energy $\\omega$ matches the particle's intrinsic energy eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$. This pole represents a stable, long-lived particle. The functional dependence is an inverse relationship with the energy difference $(\\omega - \\epsilon_k)$.\n\nThe following Python code demonstrates this calculation for a given set of energy values.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the parameters\n# omega: The frequency (energy) of the propagating particle (in eV)\nomega = 2.5\n# epsilon_k: The single-particle energy eigenvalue (in eV)\nepsilon_k = 2.0\n# eta: A small positive infinitesimal for causal boundary conditions\neta = 1e-9\n\n# Calculate the denominator of the Green's function\ndenominator = (omega - epsilon_k) + 1j * eta\n\n# Calculate the bare Green's function G_0\nG0 = 1 / denominator\n\n# Print the explanation and the final equation with all values\nprint(\"The bare Green's function G_0 is calculated using the formula:\")\nprint(\"G_0(omega, epsilon_k) = 1 / (omega - epsilon_k + i*eta)\\n\")\nprint(\"For the given values:\")\nprint(f\"omega = {omega}\")\nprint(f\"epsilon_k = {epsilon_k}\")\nprint(f\"eta = {eta}\\n\")\nprint(\"The calculation is:\")\n# Using f-string formatting to display the full equation and result\n# We format the complex number to show both real and imaginary parts clearly\nprint(f\"G_0 = 1 / ({omega} - {epsilon_k} + i*{eta})\")\nprint(f\"G_0 = 1 / ({(omega - epsilon_k):.1f} + {eta}j)\")\nprint(f\"G_0 = {G0.real:.4f} + {G0.imag:.4f}j\")\n```\n<<<$G_0(\\mathbf{k}, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\eta}$>>>"
