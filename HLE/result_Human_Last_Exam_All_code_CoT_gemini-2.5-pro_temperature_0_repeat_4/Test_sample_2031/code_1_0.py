# The user wants to understand the significance of 'opals' in the provided poem.
# The poem describes a woman in her "bedbound years" reflecting on a vibrant, tumultuous past.
# Her memories, once "brass adornments," now return as "nightly fears."
# The final lines describe her: "Her keepsake eyes are opals, skin a moonstone / silver, always silver, always cold."

# Let's analyze the choices:
# A. Decay: While she is old and "cold," opals are vibrant and full of color, not typically symbols of decay.
# B. Transformation: The woman has transformed, but the key feature of an opal is its internal, shifting complexity, not just a change from one state to another.
# C. Complexity: Her life was complex, and opals are complex stones. This is a good fit.
# D. Complex emotions: Her memories evoke complex emotions (pride, fear). The shifting colors of an opal can represent this. Also a good fit.
# F. Bad luck: Opals can be associated with bad luck, but the poem focuses more on the nature of memory than on a simple curse.
# G. Secrecy and depth of character: The poem mentions "long-lost secrets," and opals have visible depth. This is also a strong contender.

# Let's compare the strongest options (C, D, E, G).
# The most specific and fitting choice is E. The poem is fundamentally about memory.
# The eyes are called "keepsake eyes," directly linking them to what is remembered.
# The most famous quality of an opal is its "play-of-color"â€”how its appearance shifts with the light and angle.
# This perfectly mirrors how memories can shift in their meaning and emotional impact over time. A "winning streak" can later be remembered with fear or regret.
# Therefore, the opals symbolize the shifting depth of her memories.

# The final answer is E.
print("The best answer is E. The metaphor of 'opals' for the woman's 'keepsake eyes' directly connects the physical properties of the gemstone to the poem's central theme of memory. Opals are known for their play-of-color, a phenomenon where the stone's appearance and colors shift depending on the angle of light. This quality serves as a perfect symbol for how memories are not static but have a shifting depth; their meaning and emotional weight can change over time, just as the woman's vibrant past now returns to her as 'nightly fears'.")
