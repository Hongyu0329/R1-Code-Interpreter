    "The user's question contains a contradiction. Let's break down the requirements to understand why.\n\n**Thinking Steps:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the term \"Optical Activity\":** A material is optically active if it can rotate the plane of polarized light. A fundamental requirement for a crystal to be optically active is that it must be **chiral**.\n2.  **Analyze the term \"Chiral\":** A chiral structure is one that is not superimposable on its mirror image. In crystallography, this means the crystal's point group symmetry must not contain any roto-inversion operations, which include a center of inversion (i or -1) and mirror planes (m).\n3.  **Analyze the term \"Achiral\":** An achiral structure is the opposite of a chiral one. It *is* superimposable on its mirror image because its point group symmetry *does* contain a center of inversion or a mirror plane.\n4.  **Identify the Contradiction:** The question asks for crystal classes that are **achiral** but also have the symmetry for **optical activity**.\n    *   To be optically active, a class must be **chiral**.\n    *   The question specifies the class must be **achiral**.\n    *   A crystal class cannot be both chiral and achiral at the same time.\n\nTherefore, the premise of the question is flawed. There are no achiral crystal classes that can exhibit optical activity.\n\nThe following Python code will programmatically check all 32 crystal classes against these conflicting criteria to demonstrate that no such class exists.\n\n```python\ndef find_crystal_classes():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the 32 crystal classes to find those that meet a specific set of criteria.\n    The code demonstrates that no crystal class can be simultaneously achiral and optically active.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Data for the 32 crystal classes (point groups)\n    # Format: (Hermann-Mauguin symbol, is_chiral, is_polar)\n    # Note: A class is optically active if and only if it is chiral.\n    crystal_classes = [\n        # Triclinic\n        ('1', True, True), ('-1', False, False),\n        # Monoclinic\n        ('2', True, True), ('m', False, True), ('2/m', False, False),\n        # Orthorhombic\n        ('222', True, False), ('mm2', False, True), ('mmm', False, False),\n        # Tetragonal\n        ('4', True, True), ('-4', False, False), ('4/m', False, False),\n        ('422', True, False), ('4mm', False, True), ('-42m', False, False), ('4/mmm', False, False),\n        # Trigonal\n        ('3', True, True), ('-3', False, False), ('32', True, False),\n        ('3m', False, True), ('-3m', False, False),\n        # Hexagonal\n        ('6', True, True), ('-6', False, False), ('6/m', False, False),\n        ('622', True, False), ('6mm', False, True), ('-6m2', False, False), ('6/mmm', False, False),\n        # Cubic\n        ('23', True, False), ('m-3', False, False), ('432', True, False),\n        ('-43m', False, False), ('m-3m', False, False)\n    ]\n\n    print(\"Analyzing the 32 crystal classes based on the following criteria:\")\n    print(\"1.
