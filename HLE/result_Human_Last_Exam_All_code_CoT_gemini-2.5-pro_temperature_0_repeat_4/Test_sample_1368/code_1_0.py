# The user wants the shortest sequence of commands to construct an inscribed square.
# Let's represent the construction steps as a sequence of 'C' for Circle and 'L' for Line.

# Step 1: We are given the center (P0) and a point on the circle (P1).
# Draw a line through P0 and P1 to define the first diameter. This line intersects the circle at a new point, P2.
# Command: L
# Current sequence: "L"

# Step 2: We need to construct the perpendicular bisector of the diameter P1-P2.
# To do this, we draw a circle centered at P1 with a radius equal to the diameter (distance P1 to P2).
# Command: C
# Current sequence: "LC"

# Step 3: Draw another circle centered at P2 with the same radius (distance P2 to P1).
# These two circles will intersect at two new points (P3 and P4).
# Command: C
# Current sequence: "LCC"

# Step 4: Draw a line connecting the two new intersection points, P3 and P4.
# This line is the second diameter, perpendicular to the first.
# The four points where the two diameters intersect the original circle form the square.
# Command: L
# Final sequence: "LCCL"

construction_sequence = "LCCL"
