    "Here is the plan to solve the problem:\n1.  **Identify Constants and Given Values:** We need the reduced Planck constant (ħ), the Bohr radius (a₀) for the first orbit, and the given uncertainty in position (Δx).\n2.  **Calculate Uncertainty in Momentum (Δp):** Using Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle, Δp * Δx ≥ ħ/2. We will use the minimum uncertainty, so the formula becomes Δp = ħ / (2 * Δx).\n3.  **Calculate Momentum in the First Bohr Orbit (p):** For the first Bohr orbit (n=1), the angular momentum is L = p * r = n * ħ. With n=1 and r = a₀ (Bohr radius), the linear momentum is p = ħ / a₀.\n4.  **Find the Ratio:** Calculate the ratio of the uncertainty in momentum to the momentum (Δp / p).\n5.  **Construct the Python Script:** The script will define the constants, perform the calculations from steps 2-4, and print out each step of the calculation along with the final ratio.\n\n```python\nimport scipy.constants\n\ndef calculate_momentum_ratio():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the ratio of the uncertainty of the momentum of an electron\n    to its momentum in the first Bohr orbit.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first.
