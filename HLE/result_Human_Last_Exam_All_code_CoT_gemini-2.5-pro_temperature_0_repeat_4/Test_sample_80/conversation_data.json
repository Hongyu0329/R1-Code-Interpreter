    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of non-attacking bishops that can be placed on the edge squares of a chessboard and then find out how many edge squares are left empty.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Calculate the total number of edge squares.** An 8x8 board has a perimeter. The number of squares on the perimeter is `(8 * 4) - 4` (for the double-counted corners), which is 28.\n2.  **Divide the problem by color.** Bishops can only attack other pieces on squares of the same color. The 28 edge squares are evenly divided into 14 white squares and 14 black squares. We can solve for the maximum number of bishops on each color set independently.\n3.  **Analyze the white edge squares.** We need to find the maximum number of non-attacking bishops we can place on the 14 white edge squares. Bishops attack along diagonals. We must check if any of the 14 white edge squares share a diagonal. The corner squares `a8` and `h1` are both white and lie on the same long diagonal. Therefore, we can only place a bishop on one of these two squares. All other white edge squares do not share a diagonal with another white edge square. This means we can place bishops on 13 of the 14 white edge squares.\n4.  **Analyze the black edge squares.** Similarly, we check the 14 black edge squares. The corner squares `a1` and `h8` are both black and lie on the other long diagonal. Thus, only one bishop can be placed between them. This means we can place bishops on 13 of the 14 black edge squares.\n5.  **Calculate the final result.** The total number of bishops that can be placed is the sum from both colors: 13 (white) + 13 (black) = 26.\n6.  The number of edge squares that lack bishops is the total number of edge squares minus the total number of bishops placed: 28 - 26 = 2.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements this logic and prints the result.\n\n```python\ndef solve_bishops_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates how many edge squares would lack bishops if the maximum\n    number of non-attacking bishops are placed on them.\n    \"\"\"\n    board_size = 8\n\n    # Step 1: Calculate the total number of edge squares.\n    # For an N x N board, this is 4 * (N - 1).\n    total_edge_squares = 4 * (board_size - 1)\n\n    # Step 2: Divide the squares by color.\n    # On a standard chessboard, edge squares are split evenly.\n    white_edge_squares = total_edge_squares // 2\n    black_edge_squares = total_edge_squares // 2\n\n    # Step 3: Analyze placement on white squares.\n    # The white corners a8 and h1 are on the same diagonal.\n    # This creates one conflict, so one square must remain empty.\n    white_conflicts = 1\n    max_white_bishops = white_edge_squares - white_conflicts\n\n    # Step 4: Analyze placement on black squares.\n    # The black corners a1 and h8 are on the same diagonal.\n    # This creates one conflict, so one square must remain empty.\n    black_conflicts = 1\n    max_black_bishops = black_edge_squares - black_conflicts\n\n    # Step 5: Calculate the total bishops and empty squares.\n    total_bishops_placed = max_white_bishops + max_black_bishops\n    empty_edge_squares = total_edge_squares - total_bishops_placed\n\n    # Step 6: Print the explanation and the final calculation.\n    print(f\"A chessboard has {total_edge_squares} edge squares ({white_edge_squares} white and {black_edge_squares} black).\")\n    print(\"To place the maximum number of non-attacking bishops, we analyze each color separately.\")\n    print(f\"For the {white_edge_squares} white edge squares, one bishop must be omitted because two squares ('a8' and 'h1') are on the same diagonal.\")\n    print(f\"For the {black_edge_squares} black edge squares, one bishop must be omitted because two squares ('a1' and 'h8') are on the same diagonal.\")\n    print(f\"\\nMaximum bishops that can be placed: ({white_edge_squares} - {white_conflicts}) + ({black_edge_squares} - {black_conflicts}) = {total_bishops_placed}\")\n    print(\"\\nThe number of edge squares lacking bishops is the total number of edge squares minus the total bishops placed.\")\n    print(f\"Final Equation: {total_edge_squares} - {total_bishops_placed} = {empty_edge_squares}\")\n\nsolve_bishops_puzzle()\n<<<2>>>\n```"
