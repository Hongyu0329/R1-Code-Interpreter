The predecessor cardinal of the cofinality of kappa, which we can denote as $(\text{cf}(\kappa))^-$. This value is well-defined provided that $\text{cf}(\kappa)$ is a successor cardinal. For example, if $\kappa = \aleph_1$, then $\text{cf}(\kappa) = \aleph_1$, and its predecessor is $\mu = \aleph_0$. If $\kappa = \aleph_\omega$, then $\text{cf}(\kappa) = \aleph_0$, which is a limit cardinal, so no such largest $\mu$ exists.
