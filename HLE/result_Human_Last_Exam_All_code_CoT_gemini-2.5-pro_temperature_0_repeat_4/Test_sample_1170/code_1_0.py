    Solves the tensor-triangulated geometry puzzle.

    Based on the analysis of the Balmer spectrum of the category K, the following conclusions are drawn:
    1. The set of prime tt-ideals is in bijection with the points of the projective line P^1_k,
       which includes a generic point, a point at infinity, and one point for each element of the field k.
    2. The objects that generate a prime tt-ideal are those that are "indecomposable" in the tt-sense and do not generate the whole category.
    3. Analysis of the list of 20 objects reveals the following candidates for prime generators:
       - Object 15 (S) generates the prime corresponding to the generic point.
       - Object 6 (gap^(p-1)(rad(kCp))) generates the prime at infinity.
       - Object 5 (gap^1(rad(kCp))) generates the prime at 0.
       - Object 7 (cone(τ)) generates a prime corresponding to a scalar λ in k*.
    4. Other objects on the list either generate the same primes or do not generate prime ideals:
       - Objects 1, 2, 3, 4 generate the whole category.
       - Objects 8, 9 are non-special tensor powers and do not generate primes.
       - Objects 13, 14, 18, 19, 20 are tensor products of generators for different primes and do not generate primes.
       - Objects 10, 11, 12, 16, 17 generate the same prime ideals as 7 or 15 due to properties of the tensor product and p-th powers in characteristic p.
    5. The list of objects that generate a prime ideal is therefore {5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 12, 15, 16, 17}.
    6. These objects generate 4 distinct prime ideals. The total number of prime ideals is |k|+2.
       For the number of non-generated primes to be a single integer, a specific field must be assumed.
       Assuming k=F_3 (the smallest odd prime field, making p=3), there are 3+2=5 primes.
       This leaves 5 - 4 = 1 prime ideal not generated by any object on the list.
