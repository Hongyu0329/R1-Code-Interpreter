# The riddle describes a preference for items with a "peculiar shape"
# and gives the starting letters of one such item as "Cafi."
# This points to the chemical molecule Caffeine, which has a complex
# and notable molecular structure (a "peculiar shape").
# The task is to write the name correctly.

# The fragment of the name provided in the riddle.
name_fragment = "Cafi"

# The part needed to complete the name correctly.
name_completion = "feine"

# The final, correctly spelled name is formed by combining the two parts.
# This can be seen as a simple string equation.
correct_name = name_fragment + name_completion
