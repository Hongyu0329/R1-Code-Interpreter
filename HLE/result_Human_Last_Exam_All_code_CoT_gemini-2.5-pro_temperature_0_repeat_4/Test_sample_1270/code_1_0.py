# The molecule "mercedesbenzene" is interpreted as 1,3,5-triphenylbenzene.
# This structure consists of a central benzene ring and three phenyl groups attached to it,
# resembling the Mercedes-Benz logo.

# 1. Carbons in the central benzene ring
carbons_in_central_ring = 6

# 2. Number of attached phenyl groups (representing the three-pointed star)
num_phenyl_groups = 3

# 3. Carbons in each attached phenyl group
carbons_per_phenyl_group = 6

# 4. Calculate the total number of carbons
total_carbons = carbons_in_central_ring + (num_phenyl_groups * carbons_per_phenyl_group)

# Print the equation with the final result
print(f"The total number of carbons in mercedesbenzene is calculated as follows:")
print(f"({carbons_in_central_ring}) + ({num_phenyl_groups} * {carbons_per_phenyl_group}) = {total_carbons}")
