    print("\nStep 1: Analyze the spaces and the question.")
    print("  - X is a compact connected metric space with more than one point (e.g., the interval [0, 1]).")
    print("  - 2^X is the hyperspace of non-empty closed subsets of X, which is a complete metric space because X is compact.")
    print("  - P(X) is the subspace of 2^X containing sets of the form {x_n} U {x}, where x_n -> x non-trivially.")
    print("  - The question asks for the cardinality of G = intersect(O_n for n in N), where each O_n is an open dense subset of P(X).")

    print("\nStep 2: Apply the Baire Category Theorem.")
    print("  - The Baire Category Theorem states that in a Baire space, any countable intersection of open dense subsets is dense.")
    print("  - To apply this, we must determine if P(X) is a Baire space.")
    print("  - A key result from descriptive set theory is that P(X) is a G_delta subset of the complete metric space 2^X.")
    print("  - A G_delta subset of a complete metric space is a Baire space (with the subspace topology).")
    print("  - Therefore, P(X) is a Baire space.")

    print("\nStep 3: Determine the cardinality of the intersection G.")
    print("  - Since P(X) is a Baire space, the intersection G is a dense subset of P(X).")
    print("  - The space P(X) has no isolated points. A dense subset of a T1 topological space with no isolated points must have at least the same cardinality as the space itself.")
    print("  - Thus, the cardinality of G is equal to the cardinality of P(X): |G| = |P(X)|.")

    print("\nStep 4: Calculate the cardinality of P(X).")
    print("  - First, the cardinality of X itself is c (the continuum, 2^aleph_0), because it's a connected metric space with more than one point.")
    print("  - An element of P(X) is a specific type of countable subset of X.")
    print("  - The total number of countable subsets of X is |X|^aleph_0 = c^aleph_0 = (2^aleph_0)^aleph_0 = 2^(aleph_0 * aleph_0) = 2^aleph_0 = c.")
    print("  - This means |P(X)| <= c.")
    print("  - We can also show |P(X)| >= c. For any point x in X (which is not isolated), we can construct a sequence converging to it, forming an element of P(X). This gives at least |X| = c such elements.")
    print("  - Therefore, the cardinality of P(X) is exactly c.")

    print("\nStep 5: Final Conclusion.")
    print("  - From the previous steps, we have |G| = |P(X)| = c.")
    print("  - This result holds for any space X that meets the problem's criteria.")
    print("  - The smallest possible cardinality is therefore c, the cardinality of the continuum.")

    print("\nThe final answer is the cardinality c, which is given by the equation c = 2^aleph_0.")
    print("The numbers in this equation are:")
