    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the core mathematical question:** The user is asking for the largest possible size (order) of a torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve, with the constraints that the curve is defined over the number field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ and the torsion subgroup is non-cyclic.\n\n2.  **Recall the relevant mathematical theorems:** The classification of possible torsion subgroups of elliptic curves over number fields is a deep and known result in arithmetic geometry. For general quadratic fields, the possible torsion structures were classified by Kamienny, Kenku, and Momose. For the specific field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$, the list of possible torsion subgroups is even more constrained and has been explicitly determined.\n\n3.  **List the possible non-cyclic groups:** Based on the known classification for $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$, the possible non-cyclic torsion subgroups are:\n    *   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$\n    *   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$\n    *   $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z}$\n    *   $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$\n\n4.  **Create a Python script:** I will write a Python script to calculate the order of each of these possible groups. The order of a group $\\mathbb{Z}/n_1\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/n_2\\mathbb{Z}$ is simply $n_1 \\times n_2$. The script will:\n    *   Store the pairs $(n_1, n_2)$ for the possible non-cyclic groups.\n    *   Iterate through these pairs, calculate the order for each, and print the group and its order.\n    *   Keep track of the maximum order found.\n    *   Finally, print the largest order and the group that produces it, showing the multiplication explicitly as requested.\n\n```python\ndef find_largest_torsion_order():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the largest order of a non-cyclic torsion subgroup of an\n    elliptic curve over the number field Q(sqrt(-3)).\n\n    The possible non-cyclic torsion subgroups for an elliptic curve over\n    Q(sqrt(-3)) are known from number theory.
