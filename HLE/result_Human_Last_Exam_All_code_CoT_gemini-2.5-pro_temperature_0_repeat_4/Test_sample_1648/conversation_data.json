    "To find the largest natural number `n` such that the `(2n)`-th K-group of `Z/27` is nonzero, we need to determine the structure of these groups.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  Identify the ring `R` and the K-groups in question. Here, `R = Z/27 = Z/3^3`, and we are interested in `K_{2n}(R)`.\n2.  State the main theorem that gives the order of these groups. The computation of the algebraic K-groups of `Z/p^k` is a deep result in mathematics, with the definitive calculations completed by Hesselholt and Madsen.\n3.  Apply the theorem to our specific case (`p=3`, `k=3`). The theorem gives the order of `K_{2n}(Z/3^3)` as a function of `n`.\n4.  Analyze the resulting order to see for which `n` the group is non-zero (i.e., has an order greater than 1).\n5.  Based on this analysis, determine if a largest such `n` exists.\n6.  Write a Python script to calculate the order for any given `n` to illustrate the result.\n\n### Execution:\nAccording to a theorem by Hesselholt and Madsen, for an odd prime `p` and integers `k \\ge 1, n \\ge 1`, the even algebraic K-groups of the ring `Z/p^k` are cyclic groups whose order is given by the formula:\n\n|`K_{2n}(Z/p^k)`| = `p^(k + v_p(n))`\n\nwhere `v_p(n)` is the p-adic valuation of `n`, which counts the number of factors of `p` in the prime factorization of `n`.\n\nFor this problem, we have:\n*   The ring is `Z/27`, so `p=3` and `k=3`.\n*   The K-group is `K_{2n}(Z/27)`.\n\nPlugging these values into the formula, we get the order of the group:\n\n|`K_{2n}(Z/27)`| = `3^(3 + v_3(n))`\n\nFor the group to be non-zero, its order must be greater than 1. Let's analyze the exponent:\n*   `n` is a natural number, so `n \\ge 1`.\n*   The 3-adic valuation `v_3(n)` is the exponent of 3 in the prime factorization of `n`. For any natural number `n`, `v_3(n) \\ge 0`.\n*   Therefore, the exponent `3 + v_3(n)` is always greater than or equal to `3 + 0 = 3`.\n*   This means the order of `K_{2n}(Z/27)` is always at least `3^3 = 27`.\n\nSince the order of `K_{2n}(Z/27)` is at least 27 for every natural number `n \\ge 1`, the group is never the zero group. Consequently, there is no largest natural number `n` for which the group is non-zero.\n\nThe following Python code demonstrates this by calculating the order of `K_{2n}(Z/27)` for any given `n`.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef p_adic_valuation(n, p):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the p-adic valuation of n, denoted v_p(n).\n    This is the exponent of the highest power of p that divides n.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n == 0:\n        return float('inf')\n    if n % p != 0:\n        return 0\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0 and n % p == 0:\n        count += 1\n        n //= p\n    return count\n\ndef get_k_group_order(n, p, k):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the order of the K_{2n}(Z/p^k) group.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not isinstance(n, int) or n <= 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"n must be a natural number (positive integer).\")\n    \n    vp_n = p_adic_valuation(n, p)\n    exponent = k + vp_n\n    order = p ** exponent\n    return order, vp_n, exponent\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function to explain and demonstrate the calculation.\n    \"\"\"\n    p = 3\n    k = 3\n    \n    print(\"The problem is to find the largest natural number n such that K_{2n}(Z/27) is nonzero.\")\n    print(f\"The ring is Z/27, which corresponds to Z/p^k with p={p} and k={k}.\")\n    print(\"\\nAccording to a theorem by Hesselholt and Madsen, the order of this group is given by the formula:\")\n    print(f\"|K_{2n}(Z/p^k)| = p^(k + v_p(n))\")\n    print(f\"For our case, this is |K_{2n}(Z/27)| = {p}^({k} + v_{p}(n)).\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nLet's test this for a few values of n:\")\n    \n    test_values = [1, 2, 3, 13, 18, 99]\n    for n_val in test_values:\n        order, vp_n, exponent = get_k_group_order(n_val, p, k)\n        print(f\"\\nFor n = {n_val}:\")\n        print(f\"The 3-adic valuation, v_3({n_val}), is {vp_n}.\")\n        # Output the equation with numbers as requested\n        print(f\"The order of K_{{2*n_val}}(Z/27) is {p}^({k} + {vp_n}) = {p}^{exponent} = {order}.\")\n\n    print(\"\\nAs the calculation shows, for any natural number n, v_3(n) >= 0.\")\n    print(f\"Therefore, the exponent (3 + v_3(n)) is always >= 3.\")\n    print(f\"This means the order of the group is always at least {p**k}.\")\n    print(\"Since the order is always greater than 1, the group is never zero.\")\n    print(\"\\nConclusion: There is no largest natural number n for which this group is nonzero.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\n```\n<<<There is no largest natural number n.>>>"
