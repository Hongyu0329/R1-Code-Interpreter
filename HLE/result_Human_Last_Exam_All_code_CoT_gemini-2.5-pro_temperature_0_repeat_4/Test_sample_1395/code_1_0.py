# Step 1: Determine the chromatic number of the Asian graph before the Soviet dissolution.
# A graph derived from a geographical map is planar. The Four Color Theorem states any planar graph has a chromatic number of at most 4.
# To see if it's exactly 4, we look for a subgraph that requires 4 colors.
# Consider Laos and its neighbors: China, Myanmar, Vietnam, Cambodia, and Thailand.
# These 5 neighbors form a cycle. Laos borders all 5 of them.
# This structure is a wheel graph (W6), which is known to require 4 colors.
# Since this subgraph existed before 1991, the entire Asian graph required 4 colors.
chromatic_number_before = 4
print(f"The chromatic number of the Asian graph before the dissolution was {chromatic_number_before}.")

# Step 2: Determine the chromatic number after the dissolution.
# The dissolution of the USSR added new countries and borders in Central Asia.
# However, the subgraph involving Laos and its neighbors was unaffected by this change.
# Since the graph still contains a subgraph that requires 4 colors, its chromatic number must be at least 4.
# By the Four Color Theorem, it cannot be more than 4.
# Therefore, the chromatic number remained 4.
chromatic_number_after = 4
print(f"The chromatic number of the Asian graph after the dissolution is {chromatic_number_after}.")

# Step 3: Calculate delta_soviet, the change in the chromatic number.
delta_soviet = chromatic_number_after - chromatic_number_before
print(f"The incremental change, delta_soviet, is the difference: {chromatic_number_after} - {chromatic_number_before} = {delta_soviet}.")

# Step 4: Determine beta by analyzing the graph's planarity.
# A graph where nodes are countries and edges represent shared land borders is planar by definition.
# The map of Asia before the dissolution was planar. The map after the dissolution is also planar.
# The property of being a planar graph did not change.
# As per the problem, if the planarity did not change, beta is 1.
beta = 1
print(f"The planarity of the graph did not change, so beta = {beta}.")

# Step 5: Calculate the final answer.
final_answer = beta * delta_soviet
print(f"The final answer is beta * delta_soviet = {beta} * {delta_soviet} = {final_answer}.")
