# The problem asks to identify the types of points in a specific subset of the Berkovich projective line.
# Based on the analysis, the construction describes the p-adic upper half-plane,
# which contains all non-classical points.
# Over the field Cp, these are the points of Type 2 and Type 3.

# Print the first type number
print(2)

# Print the second type number
print(3)

# The prompt requests to output the numbers and a "final equation".
# This equation represents the collection of the identified types.
