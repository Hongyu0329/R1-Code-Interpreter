    "My plan is to first identify the key theologian who addressed the concept of changes in natural law concerning both specific miracles and systemic shifts. I will search for a major figure in Christian history who was among the first to develop a systematic, philosophical framework for this idea. The most prominent candidate is Augustine of Hippo, who distinguished between the \"ordinary course of nature\" and God's higher will, which governs it. I will then write a Python script to print out the name of this theologian and a brief explanation of his relevant concepts.\n\n```python\ndef find_theologian():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and explains the theologian who developed terminology\n    for changes in the laws of nature applicable to the virgin birth and the Fall.\n    \"\"\"\n    theologian_name = \"Augustine of Hippo\"\n    \n    explanation = (\n        \"Augustine of Hippo (354â€“430 AD) was the first major Christian theologian to develop a sophisticated \"\n        \"framework to explain events that appear to alter the laws of nature. He did not see miracles as 'unnatural' \"\n        \"or 'against nature' in an absolute sense. Instead, he developed specialized terminology and concepts:\\n\\n\"\n        \"1.  **Ordinary Course of Nature (consuetudo naturae):** Augustine described this as the regular, \"\n        \"customary way the world works, which we observe and call 'natural law'.\\n\\n\"\n        \"2.  **God's Will:** He argued that nature's course is simply an expression of God's continuous will. A miracle, \"\n        \"therefore, is not contrary to nature as God ultimately ordained it, but only contrary to the *usual course* of nature \"\n        \"that we know.\\n\\n\"\n        \"3.  **Seminal Reasons (rationes seminales):** Augustine proposed that God placed latent potentialities or 'seeds' \"\n        \"within creation from the beginning, which could be activated by God's will at a later time to produce \"\n        \"extraordinary results.\\n\\n\"\n        \"This framework allowed him to explain both the virgin birth (as an act of God's will using a latent potential in creation) \"\n        \"and the changes to the natural world at the Fall (as a shift in the 'ordinary course of nature' from a pre-lapsarian to a post-lapsarian state).\"\n    )\n    \n    print(f\"Theologian: {theologian_name}\")\n    print(\"\\nExplanation:\")\n    print(explanation)\n\nfind_theologian()\n```\n<<<Augustine of Hippo>>>"
