    "To find the central pixel of the line using Bresenham's algorithm, we first need to generate all the pixels that form the line. Then, we can find the pixel in the middle of that sequence.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  **Implement Bresenham's Algorithm**: Write a function that takes the start and end coordinates `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)` and generates the list of all pixels on the line.\n2.  **Store the Pixels**: As the algorithm runs, store each pixel's coordinates in a list.\n3.  **Find the Central Pixel**: Once all pixels are generated, find the middle element in the list of coordinates. The number of pixels is `dx + 1` which is `11 - 1 + 1 = 11`. The middle index will be `(11 - 1) // 2 = 5`.\n4.  **Print the Result**: Display the coordinates of the central pixel.\n\n```python\ndef find_central_pixel(x1, y1, x2, y2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the central pixel of a line using Bresenham's algorithm.\n    This implementation is for slopes between 0 and 1.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Calculate the differences in x and y\n    dx = x2 - x1\n    dy = y2 - y1\n\n    # Initialize the decision parameter\n    # p = 2*dy - dx\n    p = 2 * dy - dx\n\n    # Initialize starting coordinates\n    x, y = x1, y1\n\n    # Store the pixels of the line\n    pixels = []\n\n    # Iterate from x1 to x2\n    while x <= x2:\n        # Add the current pixel to the list\n        pixels.append((x, y))\n\n        # Update x for the next iteration\n        x += 1\n\n        # Check the decision parameter to decide the next y\n        if p < 0:\n            # If p is negative, the next y is the same.
