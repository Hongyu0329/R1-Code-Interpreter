    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to identify the correct character.\n\n1.  **Analyze the question:** The user wants to identify a character from the 1972 film *Solaris* based on a specific feeling they express.\n2.  **Recall the characters and plot points:** The main characters on the space station are the protagonist Kris Kelvin, and the two surviving scientists, Dr. Snaut and Dr. Sartorius.\n3.  **Identify the specific sentiment:** The feeling described is being \"ashamed to miss the sound of leaves rustling on Earth.\" This points to a character who is homesick but views this emotion as a kind of weakness or an unscientific, primitive urge.\n4.  **Pinpoint the character:** While the protagonist Kris Kelvin is deeply nostalgic for Earth, it is the cynical scientist Dr. Snaut who explicitly confesses to being ashamed of this specific feeling. In a conversation with Kris, he admits to this \"atavistic\" longing, viewing it as an embarrassing weakness in their sterile, scientific environment.\n5.  **Match with answer choices:** The character is Dr. Snaut, which corresponds to option C.\n6.  **Generate the code:** I will write a simple Python script that declares the character's name and the corresponding answer choice and then prints them.\n\n```python\n# This script identifies the character from the 1972 movie \"Solaris\".\n# The question asks which character is ashamed to miss the sound of leaves rustling.\n# Based on the film's dialogue, this character is Dr. Snaut.\n\ncharacter_name = \"Snaut\"\nanswer_choice = \"C\"\n\nprint(f\"The character who is ashamed to miss the sound of leaves rustling is: {character_name}\")\nprint(f\"This corresponds to answer choice: {answer_choice}\")\n```\n<<<C>>>"
