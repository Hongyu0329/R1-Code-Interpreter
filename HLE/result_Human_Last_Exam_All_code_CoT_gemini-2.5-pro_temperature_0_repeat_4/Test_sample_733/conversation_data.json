    "Based on established mathematical literature, the number of finite groups that contain a maximal by inclusion product-free set of size 2 is exactly 8. These groups are the cyclic groups `C₄`, `C₅`, `C₆`, `C₇`, the Klein four-group `C₂ × C₂`, the symmetric group `S₃`, the dihedral group `D₅`, and the alternating group `A₅`.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Define the key terms**: A set `S = {a, b}` in a group `G` is product-free if `S² ∩ S = ∅`, meaning no product of two elements in `S` (including squares) is itself in `S`. It is maximal if it's not a proper subset of any other product-free set.\n2.  **State the mathematical condition**: A product-free set `S = {a, b}` is maximal if and only if the set of all other elements in the group, `G \\ S`, is exactly equal to a derived set, which we'll call `K`.\n3.  **Define the derived set K**: The set `K` is the union of several component sets:\n    *   `S⁻¹S = {s₁⁻¹s₂ | s₁, s₂ ∈ S}`\n    *   `SS⁻¹ = {s₁s₂⁻¹ | s₁, s₂ ∈ S}`\n    *   `R_S = {g ∈ G | g² ∈ S}` (the set of square roots of elements in S)\n    The full condition is `G \\ S = (S⁻¹S ∪ SS⁻¹ ∪ R_S)`.\n4.  **Provide Python Code**: I will write a Python script to verify this condition for one of the 8 groups, the cyclic group of order 6 (`C₆`). The script will use the `sympy` library to perform the group calculations. It will construct the sets `G \\ S` and `K` and print them to demonstrate they are equal, thus verifying that the chosen set `S` is a maximal product-free set of size 2 in `C₆`.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy.combinatorics.permutations import Permutation\nfrom sympy.combinatorics.named_groups import CyclicGroup\n\ndef verify_c6():\n    \"\"\"\n    Verifies that the cyclic group of order 6 (C6) has a maximal\n    product-free set of size 2.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
