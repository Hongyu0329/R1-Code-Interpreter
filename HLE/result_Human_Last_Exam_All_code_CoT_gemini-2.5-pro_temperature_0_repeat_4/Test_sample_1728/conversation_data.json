    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  **Deconstruct the Graph Definition**: I will first interpret the term \"sum of three cycles\". In graph theory, the \"sum\" or \"join\" of graphs \\(G_1\\) and \\(G_2\\), denoted \\(G_1 + G_2\\), is formed by taking disjoint copies of \\(G_1\\) and \\(G_2\\) and adding an edge between every vertex of \\(G_1\\) and every vertex of \\(G_2\\). The graph \\(G\\) in the problem is therefore the join of three cycles of length \\(n\\), i.e., \\(G = C_n + C_n + C_n\\).\n\n2.  **Use the Chromatic Number of a Graph Join**: I will use the well-known theorem for the chromatic number of a graph join, which states that \\(\\chi(G_1 + G_2) = \\chi(G_1) + \\chi(G_2)\\). This property extends to the join of multiple graphs, so for our graph \\(G\\), the chromatic number will be \\(\\chi(G) = \\chi(C_n) + \\chi(C_n) + \\chi(C_n) = 3 \\cdot \\chi(C_n)\\).\n\n3.  **Analyze the Chromatic Number of a Cycle (\\(\\chi(C_n)\\))**: The chromatic number of a cycle \\(C_n\\) depends on its length \\(n\\) (for \\(n \\ge 3\\)):\n    *   If \\(n\\) is even, the cycle is bipartite, and its chromatic number is 2.\n    *   If \\(n\\) is odd, the cycle is not bipartite, and its chromatic number is 3.\n\n4.  **Determine the Maximal Value**: The problem asks for the *maximal* chromatic number of \\(G\\). To maximize \\(\\chi(G) = 3 \\cdot \\chi(C_n)\\), I need to find the maximum possible value for \\(\\chi(C_n)\\). Based on the analysis in the previous step, the maximum value of \\(\\chi(C_n)\\) is 3.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Answer**: I will substitute the maximal value of \\(\\chi(C_n)\\) into the formula for \\(\\chi(G)\\) to get the final result. The code will print out this step-by-step reasoning and the final calculation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_maximal_chromatic_number():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates and explains the maximal chromatic number of a graph G\n    that is the sum (join) of three cycles of length n.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Introduction to the problem\n    print(\"The problem is to find the maximal chromatic number of a graph G, where G is the sum of three cycles of length n.\")\n    print(\"Let's denote a cycle of length n as C_n.\")\n    print(\"\\nStep 1: Understand the graph G\")\n    print(\"The 'sum' of graphs in this context refers to the graph join operation.
