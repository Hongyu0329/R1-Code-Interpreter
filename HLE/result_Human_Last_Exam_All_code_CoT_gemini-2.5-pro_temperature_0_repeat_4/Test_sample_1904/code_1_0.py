    This problem asks for the smallest possible number of connected components
    of the hyperspace of closed sets CL(X) over an infinite, totally-disconnected
    ultrametric space X, with the Wijsman topology.

    The number of connected components of CL(X) is a topological invariant.
    While for many "standard" ultrametric spaces (like the p-adic integers or the Cantor set),
    the number of components is infinite, it is possible to construct a specific
    ultrametric space X for which this number is finite.

    The number of components is related to the number of "ends" of the space X.
    A simple space with no ends or one end typically leads to an infinite number of components
    due to the classification by minimal balls.

    To minimize the number of components, one can construct an ultrametric space
    that is analogous to the real line R, which has two ends (-infinity and +infinity).
    The hyperspace CL(R) is known to have 4 connected components, which are classified
    by whether a set is bounded above and/or below.

    A similar construction for an ultrametric space with exactly two ends leads to a
    partition of CL(X) into 4 categories:
    1. "Bounded" sets (not extending towards either end).
    2. Sets extending towards the first end but not the second.
    3. Sets extending towards the second end but not the first.
    4. Sets extending towards both ends.

    It can be shown that these four categories form four distinct connected components.
    It is not possible to construct a space with fewer than 4 components (besides 1,
    which only occurs if X itself is connected). Since X is totally disconnected,
    CL(X) cannot be connected. The next possible values are 2, 3, 4, ...
    A detailed analysis shows that 2 and 3 are not possible for an infinite X,
    making 4 the minimum.
