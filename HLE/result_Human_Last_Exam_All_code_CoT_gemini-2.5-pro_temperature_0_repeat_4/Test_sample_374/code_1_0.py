    Calculates the highest possible order for the inertial quotient E.

    The problem asks for the highest possible order of the inertial quotient E of a block B,
    given that the defect group D is an elementary abelian group of order 16.

    1. The inertial quotient E is a subgroup of Out(D) = Aut(D)/Inn(D).
    2. Since D is abelian, Inn(D) is trivial, so E is a subgroup of Aut(D).
    3. The highest possible order for E is |Aut(D)|.
    4. D is an elementary abelian group of order 16 = 2^4.
       This means D is isomorphic to a 4-dimensional vector space over the field F_2.
    5. Aut(D) is therefore isomorphic to the general linear group GL(4, F_2).
    6. The order of GL(n, q) is given by the product:
       (q^n - q^0) * (q^n - q^1) * ... * (q^n - q^(n-1)).
    7. We calculate this for n=4 and q=2.
