    "To find the number of nonzero coefficients of order 10 in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) expansion, we can use a result from the theory of free Lie algebras. The BCH formula, `log(exp(X)exp(Y))`, is the generating function for the free Lie algebra on two generators (X and Y). The number of independent basis elements of degree `n` in this algebra corresponds to the number of nonzero coefficients in the BCH expansion at order `n`.\n\nThis number is given by Witt's formula for the dimension of the `n`-th graded component of a free Lie algebra on `k` generators:\n\n`L_n(k) = (1/n) * Σ_{d|n} μ(d) * k^(n/d)`\n\nWhere:\n*   `n` is the order, which is 10 in our case.\n*   `k` is the number of generators, which is 2 (X and Y).\n*   The sum is over all positive divisors `d` of `n`.\n*   `μ(d)` is the Möbius function.\n\nMy plan is to implement this formula in Python:\n1.  Set `n = 10` and `k = 2`.\n2.  Find all divisors of `n`. For `n=10`, the divisors are 1, 2, 5, 10.\n3.  Create a helper function to compute the Möbius function `μ(d)`.\n4.  Loop through each divisor `d`, calculate `μ(d) * k^(n/d)`, and add it to a running sum.\n5.  Multiply the final sum by `1/n`.\n6.  The script will print out each step of the calculation, showing how the final number is derived from the formula.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef get_prime_factorization(num):\n    \"\"\"Returns the prime factorization of a number as a dictionary.\"\"\"\n    factors = {}\n    d = 2\n    temp = num\n    while d * d <= temp:\n        while temp % d == 0:\n            factors[d] = factors.get(d, 0) + 1\n            temp //= d\n        d += 1\n    if temp > 1:\n        factors[temp] = factors.get(temp, 0) + 1\n    return factors\n\ndef mobius(n):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the Möbius function mu(n).\"\"\"\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    factors = get_prime_factorization(n)\n    for p in factors:\n        if factors[p] > 1:\n            return 0  # n has a squared prime factor, so mu(n) is 0\n    # If square-free, mu(n) is (-1)^k where k is the number of distinct prime factors\n    return (-1)**len(factors)\n\ndef get_divisors(n):\n    \"\"\"Returns a sorted list of divisors of n.\"\"\"\n    divs = set()\n    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            divs.add(i)\n            divs.add(n // i)\n    return sorted(list(divs))\n\ndef solve_bch_coefficients():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of nonzero BCH coefficients for a given order n\n    and number of generators k, and prints the detailed calculation.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = 10\n    k = 2\n\n    divisors = get_divisors(n)\n    total_sum = 0\n\n    # Build the string for the first line of the equation\n    # e.g., (1/10) * (1 * 2^10 - 1 * 2^5 - ...)\n    sum_str_parts = []\n    for d in divisors:\n        mu_d = mobius(d)\n        if mu_d == 0:\n            continue # Skip terms where mu(d) is 0\n        power = n // d\n        \n        sign = \" + \" if mu_d > 0 else \" - \"\n        if not sum_str_parts: # First term logic\n            sign = \"\" if mu_d > 0 else \"- \"\n            \n        sum_str_parts.append(f\"{sign}{abs(mu_d)} * {k}^{power}\")\n\n    # Build the string for the second line of the equation (with evaluated powers)\n    # e.g., (1/10) * (1024 - 32 - 4 + 2)\n    sum_val_parts = []\n    for d in divisors:\n        mu_d = mobius(d)\n        if mu_d == 0:\n            continue\n        power = n // d\n        term_val = k**power\n        total_sum += mu_d * term_val\n        \n        sign = \" + \" if mu_d > 0 else \" - \"\n        if not sum_val_parts: # First term logic\n            sign = \"\" if mu_d > 0 else \"- \"\n            \n        sum_val_parts.append(f\"{sign}{term_val}\")\n\n    final_result = total_sum // n\n\n    # Print the step-by-step calculation\n    print(f\"The number of nonzero coefficients of order {n} is given by Witt's formula L_n(k).\")\n    print(f\"For n={n} and k={k}, the divisors of {n} are {divisors}.\")\n    print(f\"The corresponding values of the Möbius function mu(d) are {[mobius(d) for d in divisors]}.\\n\")\n    \n    print(\"The calculation is as follows:\")\n    # Line 1: Symbolic form with values\n    print(f\"L_{n}({k}) = (1/{n}) * ({''.join(sum_str_parts)})\")\n    # Line 2: Evaluated powers\n    print(f\"       = (1/{n}) * ({''.join(sum_val_parts)})\")\n    # Line 3: Sum evaluated\n    print(f\"       = (1/{n}) * ({total_sum})\")\n    # Line 4: Final result\n    print(f\"       = {final_result}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    solve_bch_coefficients()\n```\n<<<99>>>"
