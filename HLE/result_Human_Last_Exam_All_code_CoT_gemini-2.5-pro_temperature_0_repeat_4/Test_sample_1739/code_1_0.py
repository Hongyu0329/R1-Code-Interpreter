def solve_bubble_frequency_correction():
    """
    This function calculates the 3rd term of the nonlinear correction to the
    linear oscillation frequency of a bubble described by the Rayleigh-Plesset equation.

    The derivation using the method of multiple scales shows that the
    amplitude-dependent part of the frequency correction, delta_omega_a, is given by:

    delta_omega_a = (A_R**2 * omega_0 / 48) * (8*omega_0**4 + 15*omega_0**2 + 6)

    where A_R is the amplitude of the radial oscillation and omega_0 is the linear frequency.

    The expression in the parenthesis can be viewed as a polynomial in y = omega_0**2:
    P(y) = 8*y**2 + 15*y + 6

    We interpret the "3rd term of the nonlinear correction" as the third term of this
    polynomial, ordered by descending powers of y.
