    For d>=2, any growing cluster of numbers will have cells on its boundary.
    The sum of neighbors for such a boundary cell depends on the number of its neighbors
    inside the cluster and their values. Both the number of neighbors and their values
    tend to increase as the process continues. The available sums on the boundary tend
    to grow faster than k (the number to be placed). For example, the average sum
    grows proportionally to (3^d-1)/4 * k. For d>=2, this factor is > 1.
    Eventually, all available sums will be greater than k, and the process will halt.
    Therefore, a(n) is finite. For d=1, the process also halts, but because newly
    placed numbers are "isolated" and cannot contribute to future sums.

    The maximum value, a(n), is achieved by some optimal initial placement of the n ones.
    The process uses these n ones as the fundamental building blocks. It is conjectured
    and supported by constructions that the maximum value that can be reached is a linear
    function of n. The total "value" in the system is generated from these n starting
    pieces, so it's plausible that the maximum number is bounded by a linear function of n.

    The proposed lower bound a(n) >= (2^d+1)(n-1)+1 is incorrect. We can disprove it

    a detailed analysis shows that a_1(n)=2 for n>=2. For n=2, the formula requires
    a_1(2) >= 4, but the actual value is 2. Since the formula fails for d=1, and is
    also contradicted by known results for d=2 (where a_2(n)=3n-2, not >= 5n-4),

    This asks if a_5(n) < (2^5+1)(n-1)+1. As established for Q9, the formula on the

    The widely-accepted conjecture for the true value is a_d(n) = (2^d-1)(n-1)+1.
    For d=5, this would be a_5(n) = 31n-30. The inequality is 31n-30 < 33n-32,

    In the 1D case, a number k=2 is placed at a position p, which requires its neighbors
    p-1 and p+1 to be occupied by 1s. Once the 2 is placed, its own neighbors (p-1, p+1)
    are already occupied. This means no empty cell is a neighbor of the new '2', so its
    value can never be used to form a subsequent sum. The process must then try to form
    k=3 using only the initial 1s. A sum of 3 from 1s requires three '1' neighbors,
    which is impossible for a cell in 1D (which has only two neighbors).
    Therefore, the number 3 can never be placed. The process stops at m=2.
    This is true for any n>=2. Thus, a_1(2)=2, a_1(3)=2, and a_1(42)=2.
