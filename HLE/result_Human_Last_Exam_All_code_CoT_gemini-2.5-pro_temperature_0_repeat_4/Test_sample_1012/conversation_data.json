    "To determine the minimum symmetric key length required to be secure against a quantum computer, we need to consider the most effective quantum attack against symmetric-key ciphers.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the Threat:** The primary quantum algorithm that threatens symmetric-key cryptography is Grover's algorithm.\n2.  **Understand the Impact:** Grover's algorithm provides a quadratic speedup for unstructured search problems, which includes brute-forcing a cryptographic key. This means that for a key of length *n*, a classical computer would take approximately 2^n operations, while a quantum computer using Grover's algorithm would take approximately sqrt(2^n) = 2^(n/2) operations. This effectively halves the security level of the key in bits.\n3.  **Establish a Security Benchmark:** A widely accepted minimum security level for modern cryptography against classical computers is 128 bits. This means an attacker would need to perform about 2^128 computations, which is considered infeasible. We want to maintain this same level of security against a quantum computer.\n4.  **Calculate the Required Key Length:** To achieve a 128-bit security level against a quantum attack, the quantum attack complexity must be at least 2^128.\n    *   Let *n* be the required symmetric key length.\n    *   Quantum attack complexity = 2^(n/2).\n    *   We set this equal to our target security level: 2^(n/2) = 2^128.\n    *   Solving for *n*, we get n/2 = 128, which means n = 256.\n5.  **Conclusion:** Therefore, a symmetric key needs to be at least 256 bits long to provide a 128-bit security level against an attack by a quantum computer.\n\nThe following Python code will demonstrate this calculation.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_quantum_resistant_key_length():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the minimum symmetric key length for post-quantum security.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A common security benchmark is 128-bit security.
