    "To determine the number of let-7 family members in humans, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Clarify the question:** The term \"members\" can be ambiguous. It could refer to mature microRNAs, precursor hairpins, or the genes that encode them. The most concrete and commonly cited number in scientific literature refers to the number of distinct genes. I will base my answer on this metric.\n2.  **Gather the data:** I will identify the specific genes belonging to the human let-7 family. This family includes several sub-families (let-7a, let-7b, etc.), some of which are encoded by more than one gene. The microRNA miR-98 is also considered a member of this family due to sequence similarity.\n3.  **Structure the code:** I will write a Python script to present this information clearly.\n    *   I'll use a dictionary to store the count of genes for each let-7 sub-family.\n    *   The script will then print the breakdown of gene counts for each sub-family.\n    *   Finally, it will construct and print an equation that sums these counts to arrive at the total number of let-7 family members (genes) in humans.\n\n```python\ndef count_human_let7_family_members():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and displays the number of let-7 family members in humans,\n    based on the count of distinct encoding genes.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The let-7 family members are typically counted by their distinct precursor genes.\n    # Some subfamilies (like let-7a and let-7f) are encoded by multiple genes.\n    # miR-98 is also considered a member of the let-7 family.\n    subfamily_gene_counts = {\n        \"let-7a\": 3,\n        \"let-7b\": 1,\n        \"let-7c\": 1,\n        \"let-7d\": 1,\n        \"let-7e\": 1,\n        \"let-7f\": 2,\n        \"let-7g\": 1,\n        \"let-7i\": 1,\n        \"miR-98\": 1\n    }\n\n    print(\"The number of human let-7 family members is determined by counting the distinct genes that encode them.\")\n    print(\"The breakdown by sub-family is as follows:\")\n    for subfamily, count in subfamily_gene_counts.items():\n        print(f\"- Genes for {subfamily}: {count}\")\n\n    # Calculate the total and create the equation string\n    total_members = sum(subfamily_gene_counts.values())\n    equation_parts = [str(count) for count in subfamily_gene_counts.values()]\n    equation_str = \" + \".join(equation_parts)\n\n    print(\"\\nThe final calculation is:\")\n    print(f\"{equation_str} = {total_members}\")\n\n    print(f\"\\nTo date, {total_members} members of the let-7 family, based on gene count, have been identified in humans.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    count_human_let7_family_members()\n```\n<<<12>>>"
