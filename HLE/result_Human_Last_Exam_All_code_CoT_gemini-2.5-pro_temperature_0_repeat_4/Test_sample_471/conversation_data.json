    "This problem is a classic application of Morse theory, which connects the analytic properties of a function (its critical points) to the topological properties of its domain (the 2-torus).\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the relevant topological invariants:** The key topological information about the 2-torus ($T^2$) is captured by its Betti numbers.\n2.  **State the Morse Inequalities:** These inequalities provide a fundamental link between the number of critical points of a function and the Betti numbers of the manifold. For a smooth Morse function $f$, the number of critical points of index $k$, denoted $c_k$, must be greater than or equal to the $k$-th Betti number, $b_k$.\n    *   $c_0$: Number of local minima.\n    *   $c_1$: Number of saddle points.\n    *   $c_2$: Number of local maxima.\n3.  **Apply the inequalities:** Use the Betti numbers for the torus to find the minimum required number of critical points of each type.\n4.  **Sum the results:** The total minimal number of critical points is the sum of the minimal numbers for each index. This result for Morse functions provides a lower bound for any smooth function. It is a known theorem that this bound is sharp, meaning there exists a function that achieves this minimum.\n5.  **Implement in Python:** Write a script that follows these steps, explains the reasoning, and prints the final calculation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_torus_critical_points():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the minimal number of critical points for a smooth function\n    on a 2-torus (T^2) using principles from Morse theory.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"To find the minimal number of critical points for a smooth function f: T^2 -> R, we use Morse theory.\")\n    print(\"This theory relates the number of critical points to the topology of the domain, the 2-torus.\")\n    print(\"\\nStep 1: Define the Betti numbers of the 2-torus (T^2).\")\n    print(\"Betti numbers describe the topological 'holes' of a space.\")\n\n    # Betti numbers for the 2-torus\n    b0 = 1  # Number of connected components\n    b1 = 2  # Number of one-dimensional 'circular' holes (the two fundamental loops of a torus)\n    b2 = 1  # Number of two-dimensional 'voids' (the surface itself)\n\n    print(f\" - b_0 = {b0} (The torus is one connected piece)\")\n    print(f\" - b_1 = {b1} (The torus has two independent loops, like latitude and longitude)\")\n    print(f\" - b_2 = {b2} (The torus encloses one surface)\")\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 2: Apply the Morse Inequalities.\")\n    print(\"The inequalities state that the number of critical points of index k (c_k) must be at least the k-th Betti number (b_k).\")\n    print(\" - c_0 (minima) >= b_0\")\n    print(\" - c_1 (saddles) >= b_1\")\n    print(\" - c_2 (maxima) >= b_2\")\n\n    # The minimal number of critical points of each type is given by the Betti numbers.\n    min_c0 = b0\n    min_c1 = b1\n    min_c2 = b2\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 3: Calculate the minimal number of each type of critical point.\")\n    print(f\" - Minimal number of minima (c_0) = {min_c0}\")\n    print(f\" - Minimal number of saddle points (c_1) = {min_c1}\")\n    print(f\" - Minimal number of maxima (c_2) = {min_c2}\")\n\n    # The total minimal number of critical points is the sum of these minima.\n    # This lower bound is achievable, for example, by the height function on a standard\n    # torus standing upright in R^3.\n    total_min_critical_points = min_c0 + min_c1 + min_c2\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 4: Sum the minima to find the total minimal number of critical points.\")\n    print(\"The final equation is the sum of the minimal number of minima, saddles, and maxima.\")\n    print(\"\\n--- Final Calculation ---\")\n    print(f\"{min_c0} + {min_c1} + {min_c2} = {total_min_critical_points}\")\n    print(\"-------------------------\")\n\n    print(f\"\\nConclusion: Any smooth function on the 2-torus must have at least {total_min_critical_points} critical points.\")\n\n# Execute the function to print the solution\nsolve_torus_critical_points()\n```\n<<<4>>>"
