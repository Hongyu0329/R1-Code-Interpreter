    "My plan is to determine the location of Geoffrey Chaucer at the time of Blanche of Lancaster's death by using established historical facts.\n\n1.  **Identify the date of death:** I will first establish the year Blanche of Lancaster died.\n2.  **Identify Chaucer's circumstances:** I will then find information about Chaucer's employment and known whereabouts during that specific year.\n3.  **Synthesize the information:** By combining these two pieces of information, I can deduce his most likely location. A key piece of evidence is his poem, *The Book of the Duchess*, which was written as an elegy for Blanche.\n4.  **Construct the code:** The Python code will store these historical facts as variables, print a logical explanation based on them, and present the final conclusion. To satisfy the prompt's unusual requirement for an equation, I will create a simple calculation using the digits of the year of death.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chaucer_location():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines where Geoffrey Chaucer was when Blanche of Lancaster died.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Establish the year of Blanche of Lancaster's death.\n    year_of_death = 1368\n\n    # Step 2: Establish Geoffrey Chaucer's known circumstances around that time.\n    chaucer_employment = \"an esquire in the court of King Edward III of England\"\n    key_evidence = \"his poem 'The Book of the Duchess', an elegy for Blanche written for the English court\"\n\n    # Step 3: Synthesize the information to form a conclusion.\n    print(f\"Blanche of Lancaster died in the year {year_of_death}.\")\n    print(f\"At this time, Geoffrey Chaucer was serving as {chaucer_employment}.\")\n    print(f\"Furthermore, a key piece of evidence is {key_evidence}.\")\n    print(\"This strongly places him in England, within the courtly circles that were mourning her death.\")\n    print(\"\\nTherefore, the most accurate answer is England.\")\n\n    # Step 4: Fulfill the requirement to output an equation with each number.\n    # We will use the digits from the year of death.\n    year_str = str(year_of_death)\n    d1 = int(year_str[0])\n    d2 = int(year_str[1])\n    d3 = int(year_str[2])\n    d4 = int(year_str[3])\n    result = d1 + d2 + d3 + d4\n\n    print(\"\\nTo fulfill the numerical requirement, here is an equation using the digits of the year:\")\n    print(f\"{d1} + {d2} + {d3} + {d4} = {result}\")\n\nsolve_chaucer_location()\n```\n<<<C>>>"
