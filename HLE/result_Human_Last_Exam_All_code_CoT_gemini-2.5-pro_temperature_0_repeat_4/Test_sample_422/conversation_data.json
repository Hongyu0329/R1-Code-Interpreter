    "The JTB (Justified True Belief) definition of knowledge posits that knowledge is a belief that is both justified and true. When we exclude Gettier problems (which challenge the sufficiency of these conditions), the model still faces fundamental issues. Here is a breakdown of two significant problems, presented in a Python script as requested.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Define the two primary problems with the JTB framework, excluding Gettier cases: The Regress Problem and the problem of Fallible/Vague Justification.\n2.  Write a Python script that clearly explains each of these problems.\n3.  To satisfy the unusual constraint of \"output each number in the final equation,\" I will create a symbolic summary at the end of the script, representing the two problems with numbers `1` and `2`.\n4.  The script will print these explanations and the summary equation directly to the console.\n\n```python\ndef explain_jtb_problems():\n    \"\"\"\n    Explains two fundamental problems with the JTB definition of knowledge,\n    ignoring Gettier-style counterexamples.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    problem_1_title = \"Problem 1: The Regress Problem of Justification\"\n    problem_1_explanation = (\n        \"The JTB theory requires that a belief be justified.

This leads to an infinite regress. \"\n        \"The only ways to stop this chain are to accept a circular justification (e.g., J1 is justified by J3, \"\n        \"which is justified by J1) or to stop at a foundational belief that is accepted without justification. \"\n        \"The JTB model provides no solution to this 'Agrippan trilemma', leaving the entire concept of \"\n        \"justification on unstable ground.\"\n    )\n\n    problem_2_title = \"Problem 2: The Fallibility and Vagueness of Justification\"\n    problem_2_explanation = (\n        \"The JTB model treats justification and truth as independent conditions, which means a belief can be \"\n        \"justified but ultimately false.

For a belief to be justified, its justification must also be justified, leading to a chain (P is justified by Q, Q by R, etc.) that must either go on forever, circle back on itself, or stop at an arbitrary, unjustified belief. The JTB framework does not solve this problem.\n2. **The Fallibility and Vagueness of Justification**: The JTB model does not specify what level or type of justification is sufficient for knowledge, making the condition vague (e.g., the lottery paradox). Furthermore, because justification and truth are independent, a belief can be justified but false. This means justification is not a reliable guide to truth, and the connection between our evidence and reality can seem coincidental.>>>"
