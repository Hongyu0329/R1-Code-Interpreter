    This function explains and prints the solution to the mathematical problem.

    The problem asks for the smallest possible number of accumulation points
    of a specific countable set of ultrafilters in the Stone-Cech remainder N*.

    The analysis shows that due to the problem's constraints, the set of
    accumulation points is always in one-to-one correspondence with the set of
    non-principal ultrafilters on a countable set.
