    # A: False. The momentum operator is a generator with a continuous spectrum.
    # B1: True. Scale invariance, represented by the conservation of the dilatation generator,
    #     implies a potential of the form V(r) proportional to 1/r^2.
    # B2: False. The scaling factors derived from the generator do not match the statement.
    # C: False. The condition [τ, H] = 0 is both necessary and sufficient for [S, H] = 0.
    # D: True. A direct consequence of [τ, H] = 0.
    # E: True. This is the definition of the angular momentum operator L_z as the generator of rotations.
    # F: True. This is a statement of Ehrenfest's theorem for a conserved quantity.
    # G: True. The generator of a unitary operator is Hermitian. The premise is always true and irrelevant.
    # H: False. An unbounded operator (like the QHO Hamiltonian) can have a discrete spectrum.
    # I: True. A consequence of the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula for non-commuting operators.
    # J: True. A direct consequence of [S, H] = 0.
