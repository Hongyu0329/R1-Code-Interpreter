    "To identify the three longest rivers mentioned in Virgil's Aeneid, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Compile a list of rivers:** I will search through the text of the Aeneid and classical sources to identify all the rivers mentioned by name.\n2.  **Find their lengths:** I will look up the modern geographical lengths of these identified rivers.\n3.  **Sort and select:** I will sort the rivers by length in descending order to find the top three.\n4.  **Generate Python code:** I will write a Python script that stores this data, performs the sorting, and prints the names and lengths of the three longest rivers.\n\n```python\ndef find_longest_rivers_in_aeneid():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the three longest rivers mentioned in Virgil's Aeneid,\n    sorts them by length, and prints the result.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Data: A list of tuples containing (River Name, Length in km, Mention in Aeneid)\n    # Note: Some rivers like Eridanus are mythical but often identified with real rivers (e.g., the Po).\n    rivers_in_aeneid = [\n        (\"Nile\", 6650, \"Book VIII\"),\n        (\"Danube (Ister)\", 2850, \"Book VIII\"),\n        (\"Euphrates\", 2800, \"Book VIII\"),\n        (\"Ganges\", 2525, \"Book IX\"),\n        (\"Don (Tanais)\", 1870, \"Book VIII\"),\n        (\"Tigris\", 1850, \"Book IX\"),\n        (\"Rhine\", 1233, \"Book VIII\"),\n        (\"Araxes\", 1072, \"Book VIII\"),\n        (\"Po (Eridanus)\", 652, \"Book VI\"),\n        (\"Hebrus (Maritsa)\", 480, \"Book I\"),\n        (\"Tiber\", 406, \"Throughout, esp.
