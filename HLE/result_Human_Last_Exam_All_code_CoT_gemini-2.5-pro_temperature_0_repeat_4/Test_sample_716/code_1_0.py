# Problem: Find the Hausdorff dimension of the curve defined by:
# x(t) = sin(pi * t)
# y(t) = sin(t)
# z(t) = cos(2t)

# Step 1: Analyze the smoothness of the curve.
# The vector function for the curve is r(t) = (sin(pi*t), sin(t), cos(2t)).
# The component functions are sines and cosines, which are infinitely
# differentiable (C^infinity). Thus, the curve is smooth.

# Step 2: Check if the curve is regular.
# A curve is regular if its tangent vector, r'(t), is never the zero vector.
# The derivative r'(t) is the vector of the derivatives of the components:
# r'(t) = (pi * cos(pi * t), cos(t), -2 * sin(2t))
# For r'(t) to be the zero vector, all components must be zero simultaneously:
#   1. pi * cos(pi * t) = 0  => t = 1/2 + n (for integer n)
#   2. cos(t) = 0           => t = pi/2 + m*pi (for integer m)
#   3. -2 * sin(2t) = 0      => t = k*pi/2 (for integer k)
#
# For conditions 1 and 2 to hold for the same t, we would need:
#   1/2 + n = pi/2 + m*pi
#   1 + 2n = pi * (1 + 2m)
#   pi = (1 + 2n) / (1 + 2m)
# This equation implies that pi is a rational number, which is a well-known
# contradiction. Therefore, the tangent vector r'(t) is never the zero vector.
# The curve is regular.

# Step 3: Apply the theorem for Hausdorff dimension.
# A regular, continuously differentiable (C^1) curve is a 1-dimensional
# differentiable manifold.
# A key theorem states that the Hausdorff dimension of a C^1 k-dimensional
# manifold is equal to its dimension, k.

# Step 4: Conclusion.
# Since our curve is a regular 1-dimensional C^1 manifold, its Hausdorff
# dimension is k=1.

    # The final answer is the dimension k.
