    "This is a fascinating question that combines color theory and music theory, based on Isaac Newton's work. Here is my plan to solve it:\n\n1.  **Recall Newton's Color Circle:** I will first establish the specific mapping that Isaac Newton proposed between the seven colors of the light spectrum and the seven notes of a diatonic musical scale.\n2.  **Analyze the Colors in the Question:**\n    *   The first color is \"the colour produced when combining yellow and blue.\" In color theory (both additive and subtractive), this combination produces **Green**.\n    *   The second color is simply **Blue**.\n3.  **Identify the Musical Range:** The question asks for the note corresponding to the range *between* Green and Blue.\n4.  **Interpret the \"Range\":** On Newton's circle, the colors are arranged in segments. The range from the start of the Green segment to the start of the Blue segment *is* the Green segment itself. The question asks for a single \"musical note,\" which points to the note associated with this specific segment.\n5.  **Determine the Final Note:** By looking up the note for the Green segment in Newton's mapping, I can find the answer.\n6.  **Construct the Code:** I will write a Python script that programmatically follows these steps, explains the logic, and prints the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_newton_color_music_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script solves the riddle by mapping Newton's color circle to the musical scale\n    and identifying the note corresponding to the specified color range.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Define Newton's mapping of colors to musical notes.\n    # This is a well-established correspondence from his work 'Opticks'.\n    newton_color_to_note = {\n        \"Red\": \"C\",\n        \"Orange\": \"D\",\n        \"Yellow\": \"E\",\n        \"Green\": \"F\",\n        \"Blue\": \"G\",\n        \"Indigo\": \"A\",\n        \"Violet\": \"B\"\n    }\n\n    # Step 2: Identify the colors from the user's question.\n    # The color produced when combining yellow and blue is Green.\n    start_color = \"Green\"\n    end_color = \"Blue\"\n\n    # Step 3: Find the corresponding musical notes for the start and end of the range.\n    start_note = newton_color_to_note[start_color]\n    end_note = newton_color_to_note[end_color]\n\n    # Step 4: Explain the logic and determine the final answer.\n    # The question asks for a single note for the \"range between\" Green and Blue.\n    # On Newton's color circle, the colors are segments. The segment that lies\n    # between the start of Green and the start of Blue is the Green segment itself.\n    # Therefore, the note for this range is the note associated with Green.\n    final_note = start_note\n\n    print(\"Isaac Newton's 'Opticks' proposed a link between the seven colors of the spectrum and the seven notes of a musical scale.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n    print(\"Step 1: The color produced by combining yellow and blue is Green.\")\n    print(f\"Step 2: The range in question is therefore from Green to Blue.\")\n    print(f\"Step 3: In Newton's mapping, the color Green corresponds to the musical note '{start_note}'.\")\n    print(f\"Step 4: The color Blue corresponds to the musical note '{end_note}'.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n    print(\"The question asks for the single note for the 'range between' Green and Blue.\")\n    print(\"This range on the color circle is the segment for Green itself.\")\n    print(f\"Thus, the corresponding musical note is the one for Green.\")\n    print(f\"\\nFinal Answer: The musical note is {final_note}.\")\n\nsolve_newton_color_music_riddle()\n```\n<<<F>>>"
