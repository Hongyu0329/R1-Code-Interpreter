    "To determine the rarest noble gas on Earth, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **List the Noble Gases**: I will identify all the naturally occurring noble gases: Helium (He), Neon (Ne), Argon (Ar), Krypton (Kr), Xenon (Xe), and Radon (Rn).\n2.  **Find Abundances**: I will use their standard abundances in Earth's atmosphere, which is the primary reservoir where they are found and their relative abundances are compared. The values from 2002 are not materially different from today's accepted values.\n3.  **Compare Abundances**: I will create a dataset with the gases and their percentage abundances. Radon (Rn) is radioactive with a very short half-life, making it exceptionally rare. Xenon (Xe) is the rarest of the stable (non-radioactive) noble gases. The question asks for the absolute rarest, which is Radon.\n4.  **Code Implementation**: I will write a Python script to store these abundance values, find the minimum value among them, and identify the corresponding gas. The script will print out the comparison and the final result, including the name of the gas and its percentage, to show how the conclusion was reached.\n\n```python\ndef find_rarest_noble_gas():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the rarest noble gas on Earth by finding the minimum\n    value among their atmospheric abundances.
