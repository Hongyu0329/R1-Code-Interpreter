    This function explains the primary reason for the significance of the film "Snow In Midsummer" for Malaysians.
    """
    explanation = """The most significant reason for the film's importance to Malaysians is that it addresses the deeply sensitive and politically charged May 13, 1969 racial riots, a topic often suppressed in the country's official history. The fact that it was produced without any funding from the National Film Development Corporation Malaysia (FINAS) highlights the official reluctance to confront this historical trauma.

Its subsequent success and international renown, including major nominations and awards, validated the importance of this suppressed story on a global stage. This combination of tackling a taboo subject, achieving it through independent means against institutional headwinds, and gaining international acclaim makes the film a landmark moment for artistic freedom and historical reckoning in Malaysia. It represents a powerful act of remembrance and a challenge to official silence."""
