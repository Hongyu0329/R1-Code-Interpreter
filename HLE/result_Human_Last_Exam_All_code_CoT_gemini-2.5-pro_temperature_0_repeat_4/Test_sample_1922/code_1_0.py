    analysis = {
        'A': "Correct. Augustine's later writings against Pelagianism emphasize divine grace and predestination to such a degree that they are widely seen as a major foundation for the later doctrines of John Calvin. The comparison is a common topic in historical theology.",
        'B': "Incorrect. This statement misrepresents the work of the historian R. A. Markus. While Markus did analyze Augustine's concept of freedom, a central part of his and other modern scholars' work is precisely to understand how Augustine's views on the will are shaped by and integrated with his doctrines of grace and predestination. A serious scholar like Markus would not simply 'ignore' these crucial, interconnected concepts.",
        'C': "Correct. The 'voluntas' (will) is a central faculty in Augustine's model of the human psyche. In works like 'On Free Will,' he establishes it as the source of moral action. He was well-read in classical philosophy and his thought shows engagement with Stoic ideas, including those of Seneca.",
        'D': "Correct. This is a hallmark of Augustinian thought. For Augustine, faith and reason are not separate but intertwined ('faith seeking understanding'). Philosophical problems, like free will, cannot be resolved without recourse to theological truths, such as the nature of God, sin, and grace.",
        'E': "Correct. Etienne Gilson was a prominent 20th-century historian of philosophy. This statement accurately reflects a nuanced scholarly interpretation of Augustine's view on grace, noting its powerful, or 'irresistible,' nature while correctly distinguishing it from the specific theological formulations of Jansenism, which were later condemned.",
        'F': "Correct. This accurately summarizes a key argument from Augustine's early dialogue, 'On Free Will' ('De libero arbitrio'), where his interlocutor is Evodius. Augustine argues that God is not the cause of evil; rather, evil arises from the misuse of the free will ('voluntas') that God gave to humans, making them responsible for their own actions."
