    "My plan to solve this problem is to interpret the given `verbatim` block as a visual representation of a word, where the characters 't' and 'b' are used to draw the shapes of letters.\n\nHere is the step-by-step breakdown of the plan:\n1.  **Parse the Input**: The text inside the `verbatim` block will be treated as a set of drawing instructions laid out on a grid. Each line of text corresponds to a row in this grid.\n2.  **Construct the Grid**: I will write a Python script to create a 2D grid. The script will first determine the necessary width and height from the input text. Then, it will populate the grid by placing each 't' and 'b' character at its correct `(row, column)` coordinate, preserving all spacing from the original text.\n3.  **Render the Image**: The script will then iterate through the constructed grid. It will print a '#' for every 't' or 'b' character found, and a space for everything else. This will effectively \"draw\" the encoded word on the console.\n4.  **Identify the Word**: By observing the output image generated by the script, the hidden word will be revealed.\n\nThe instruction \"output each number in the final equation\" seems to be a leftover from a different problem template and does not apply to this task, so it will be disregarded.\n\nHere is the Python code to decode and display the word:\n\n```python\ndef decode_word():\n    \"\"\"\n    Decodes and prints a word that is visually encoded in a block of text.\n    The 't' and 'b' characters are interpreted as pixels of block letters.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The encoded text from the verbatim block\n    encoded_text = \"\"\"t b b t t t t b b b\nb\nb\nb\nt\nb\nt b t t b b b b b b\n                  b\n                  b\n                  t\n                  t\n                  b\nb b t t t t b t b b\"\"\"\n\n    lines = encoded_text.split('\\n')\n\n    # Determine the grid dimensions from the input text\n    max_width = 0\n    for line in lines:\n        if len(line) > max_width:\n            max_width = len(line)\n    height = len(lines)\n\n    # Create a grid and initialize with spaces\n    grid = [[' ' for _ in range(max_width)] for _ in range(height)]\n\n    # Populate the grid with the characters from the input\n    for r, line in enumerate(lines):\n        for c, char in enumerate(line):\n            grid[r][c] = char\n\n    # Print the visual representation of the word\n    print(\"The decoded word is:\")\n    for row in grid:\n        output_line = \"\"\n        for char in row:\n            # Both 't' and 'b' represent a part of a letter\n            if char in ('t', 'b'):\n                output_line += '#'\n            else:\n                output_line += ' '\n        print(output_line)\n\n# Execute the function to solve the puzzle\ndecode_word()\n```\n<<<CODE>>>"
