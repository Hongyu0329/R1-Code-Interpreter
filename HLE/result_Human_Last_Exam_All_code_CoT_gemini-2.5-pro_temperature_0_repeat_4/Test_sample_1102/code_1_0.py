# --- Given Parameters ---
# The arc gap is a critical parameter for determining voltage.

# These are typical values for TIG welding with Argon shielding gas.
# We select values within the typical range that help illustrate the best choice.

# The voltage is the sum of the drop at the electrodes and the voltage across the arc column.
