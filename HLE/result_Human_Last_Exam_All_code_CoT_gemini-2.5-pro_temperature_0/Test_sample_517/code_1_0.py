    This function calculates the limit of p_n based on the theoretical derivation.

    The derivation shows that for large n, the probability p_n can be approximated by
    the product of two terms:
    1. A factor from the Doob's h-transform, which simplifies to 2 * log(n).
    2. The probability q_n for a standard random walk to hit the target region
       before the origin, which is approximately 1 / (4 * log(n)).

    The limit of p_n as n approaches infinity is the limit of the product of these
    approximations.
