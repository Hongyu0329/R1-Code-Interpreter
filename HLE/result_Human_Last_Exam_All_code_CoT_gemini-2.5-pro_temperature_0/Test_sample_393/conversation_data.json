    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Interpret the Geometric Problem:** The problem is posed in the language of geometry (Tverberg's theorem), but it describes a special situation. It states that for any integer partition `a_1, ..., a_r` of `n`, a set of points `X` can be found where the Tverberg partitions correspond exactly to the set partitions of `X` with part sizes `a_1, ..., a_r`. This means the geometric setup is a premise that transforms the problem into a purely combinatorial one.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Combinatorial Problem:** The task is to count the number of ways to partition a set of `n` distinct items into `r` unordered subsets, where the sizes of the subsets are given by the multiset `{a_1, ..., a_r}`.\n\n3.  **State the Counting Formula:** This is a standard problem in combinatorics. The number of such partitions is given by the formula:\n    $$ N = \\frac{n!}{ (a_1! a_2! \\cdots a_r!) \\cdot (m_1! m_2! \\cdots m_k!) } $$\n    where:\n    *   `n` is the total number of points, `n = a_1 + ... + a_r`.\n    *   `a_i!` are the factorials of the part sizes.\n    *   `m_j!` are the factorials of the counts of identical part sizes. For example, if a size `s` appears `m_s` times in the partition, we include `m_s!` in the denominator to account for the indistinguishability of these `m_s` parts.\n\n4.  **Implement in Python:** I will write a Python script that takes a list representing the partition `a` as input, calculates `n`, the products of factorials in the denominator, and computes the final result.\n\n5.  **Format the Output:** As requested, the script will print a single line showing the full equation with all the numbers involved, along with the final calculated number of partitions. I will use the partition `[3, 3, 2, 2]` as a working example.\n\nHere is the Python code to calculate the number of partitions.\n\n```python\nimport math\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef solve_tverberg_partitions():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of Tverberg partitions for a set X with the properties described.\n    The problem is equivalent to counting the number of set partitions of a specific type.\n    \"\"\"\n    # This list represents the partition a_1, a_2, ..., a_r.\n    # You can change this list to any other valid partition.\n    # Example: A partition of n=10 into 4 parts of sizes 3, 3, 2, 2.\n    a = [3, 3, 2, 2]\n\n    # Calculate n, the total number of points.\n    n = sum(a)\n\n    # Count the occurrences of each part size (for the m_j factorials).\n    counts = Counter(a)\n\n    # Calculate the numerator of the formula.\n    numerator = math.factorial(n)\n\n    # Calculate the denominator.\n    # It is the product of the factorials of the part sizes (a_i!)\n    # times the product of the factorials of the counts of identical sizes (m_j!).\n    denominator = 1\n    denom_parts_str = []\n\n    # Contribution from a_i!\n    for part_size in a:\n        denominator *= math.factorial(part_size)\n        denom_parts_str.append(f\"{part_size}!\")\n\n    # Contribution from m_j!\n    for count in counts.values():\n        if count > 1:\n            denominator *= math.factorial(count)\n            denom_parts_str.append(f\"{count}!\")\n\n    # The final result is n! / denominator.\n    result = numerator // denominator\n\n    # Sort the parts in the denominator string for consistent representation.\n    # We sort numerically by extracting the number before the '!'\n    denom_parts_str.sort(key=lambda s: int(s[:-1]), reverse=True)\n\n    # Print the final equation as requested.\n    print(f\"For the partition {a}, the number of Tverberg's partitions is:\")\n    print(f\"{n}! / ({' * '.join(denom_parts_str)}) = {result}\")\n\nsolve_tverberg_partitions()\n```\n<<<6300>>>"
