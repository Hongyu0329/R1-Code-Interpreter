    # --- Final Answer for all parts ---
    # (a) No. A theorem in lattice theory states that the rank of an even unimodular
    #     lattice must be a multiple of 8. Since 12 is not a multiple of 8, no such
    #     lattice exists.
    # (b) Yes, as demonstrated by the construction above.
    # (c) 2. The lattice L is the Niemeier lattice N(D_24), also known as D_24^+.
    #     The farness d is the index [Z^24 : Z^24 \cap L]. The intersection is D_24,
    #     and the index [Z^24 : D_24] is 2. d=1 is impossible because L is even
    #     and Z^24 is odd. Thus, the smallest d is 2.
