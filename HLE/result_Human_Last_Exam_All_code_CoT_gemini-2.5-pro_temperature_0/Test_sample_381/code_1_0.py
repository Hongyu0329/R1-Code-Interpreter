# The problem asks for the upper bound of ||B * Q_{0, M}||_inf, expressed as a factor of sqrt(N).
# Based on the provided mathematical context and established theorems on products of
# perturbed stochastic matrices, the upper bound takes the form C * sqrt(N),
# where C is a positive constant.
# The question asks for the factor of sqrt(N) in this expression.

# The factor is the constant C.
