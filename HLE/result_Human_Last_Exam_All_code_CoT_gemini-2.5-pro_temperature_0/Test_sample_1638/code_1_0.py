    Calculates the probability using a Monte Carlo simulation.

    A point p(x, y) is randomly chosen from the unit square [0,1]x[0,1].
    The vertices of the square are v1=(0,0), v2=(1,0), v3=(0,1), v4=(1,1).
    The distance from p to a vertex v is d(p,v).
    The problem asks for the probability that floor(1/d) = 1 for at least one vertex.
    This is equivalent to 1 <= 1/d < 2, which simplifies to 1/2 < d <= 1.
    Squaring this, we get the condition 1/4 < d^2 <= 1.

    This simulation generates a large number of random points in the unit square
    and checks what fraction of them satisfy the condition for at least one vertex.
    This fraction approximates the desired probability.
