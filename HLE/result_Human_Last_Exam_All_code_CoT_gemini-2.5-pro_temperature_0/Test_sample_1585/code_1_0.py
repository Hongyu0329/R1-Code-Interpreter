    n_2: Smallest n for the 2-planar graph.
         Based on the analysis, no such graph can exist because the geometric constraints
         require the graph to be bipartite, which cannot contain 5-cycles.
         Therefore, we assign n_2 = 0.

    n_3: Smallest n for the 3-planar graph.
         The properties suggest a graph based on a projective plane of order 4,
         leading to n = 21. This is a plausible candidate for a minimal tripartite graph
         with the given properties.
         Therefore, we assign n_3 = 21.
