    "To solve this puzzle, we first need to determine the total number of edge squares on a standard 8x8 chessboard and then find the maximum number of non-attacking bishops that can be placed on them.\n\n**Step-by-step plan:**\n\n1.  **Calculate the total number of edge squares:** An 8x8 board has 8 squares on each of its 4 sides. Since the 4 corner squares are counted in two sides each, the total number of unique edge squares is (8 * 4) - 4 = 28.\n2.  **Determine the maximum number of bishops:** To place the maximum number of bishops on the board such that none can attack another, we need an optimal placement strategy. A simple and effective strategy is as follows:\n    *   Place bishops on all 8 squares of a single column, for instance, the 'a' file (from a1 to a8). These are all edge squares, and since they are on the same file, none can attack another. This gives us 8 bishops.\n    *   Next, identify which other edge squares remain unattacked. The bishops on the 'a' file attack all the edge squares on the top and bottom rows (rank 1 and 8) and the opposite corners.\n    *   The only edge squares that are not attacked by the bishops on the 'a' file are the 6 squares on the 'h' file from h2 to h7.\n    *   We can place 6 more bishops on these squares (h2, h3, h4, h5, h6, h7). Since they are all on the same file, they do not attack each other. Also, they are not attacked by the bishops on the 'a' file.\n    *   This gives a total of 8 (on file 'a') + 6 (on file 'h') = 14 bishops. This is the maximum number of non-attacking bishops that can be placed on the edge squares.\n3.  **Calculate the number of empty edge squares:** Subtract the number of placed bishops from the total number of edge squares.\n\nThe following Python code will perform the calculation and print the result.\n\n```python\ndef solve_bishops_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of empty edge squares after placing the maximum\n    number of non-attacking bishops on the edges of a chessboard.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Calculate the total number of edge squares on an 8x8 board.\n    # An 8x8 board has 4 sides, each with 8 squares.
