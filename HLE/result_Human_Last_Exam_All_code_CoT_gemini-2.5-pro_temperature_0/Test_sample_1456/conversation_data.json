    "Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Define Key Terms**: I will start by clarifying the definitions of a \"continuum,\" \"nondegenerate,\" and \"composant\" as they are used in topology.\n2.  **State the Core Theorem**: The solution hinges on a fundamental theorem about the product of continua. The theorem states that the product space `X x Y` is indecomposable if and only if both continua `X` and `Y` are indecomposable.\n3.  **Analyze Decomposability and Composants**: I will explain the relationship between a continuum being decomposable or indecomposable and the number of its composants.\n    *   A decomposable continuum has exactly one composant (the space itself).\n    *   An indecomposable continuum has `c` (the cardinality of the continuum, which is uncountably infinite) composants.\n4.  **Examine the Cases**: Based on the theorem, there are two possible scenarios for the product space `X x Y`:\n    *   **Case 1**: At least one of `X` or `Y` is decomposable. This makes the product `X x Y` decomposable, resulting in 1 composant.\n    *   **Case 2**: Both `X` and `Y` are indecomposable. This makes the product `X x Y` indecomposable, resulting in `c` composants.\n5.  **Determine the Maximum**: By comparing the outcomes of the two cases (1 and `c`), the largest possible number of composants is clearly `c`.\n6.  **Construct the Python Code**: I will write a Python script that uses `print` statements to walk through this logical argument, display the final \"equation\" `max(1, c) = c`, and state the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_composants_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script explains the reasoning to find the largest possible number of\n    composants of the product of two nondegenerate continua.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Problem: What is the largest possible number of composants of the product of two nondegenerate continua, X and Y?\")\n    print(\"\\n--- Step 1: Definitions ---\")\n    print(\"A 'continuum' is a compact, connected metric space.\")\n    print(\"A 'nondegenerate' continuum has more than one point.\")\n    print(\"A 'composant' of a point p in a continuum is the union of all proper subcontinua containing p.\")\n    print(\"The number of composants depends on whether the continuum is decomposable or indecomposable.\")\n\n    print(\"\\n--- Step 2: Key Properties ---\")\n    print(\"1.
