    Solves the puzzle by calculating the values based on the provided text and constraints.
    The problem contains contradictory information, so a path of best-fit interpretation is chosen:
    1. Constraints are treated as primary rules.
    2. Fractional descriptions are used to determine values not explicitly set by constraints.
    3. The record counts for different categories do not need to sum to the total, as this leads to contradictions.
