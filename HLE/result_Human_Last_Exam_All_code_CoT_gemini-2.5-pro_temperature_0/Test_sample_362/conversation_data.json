    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to determine the product of the specified Wittig reaction.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:** The reaction involves an aldehyde (pivalaldehyde) and a phosphorus ylide ((2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ⁵-phosphane).\n2.  **Understand the Wittig Reaction:** This reaction converts a carbonyl group (C=O) into an alkene (C=C). The oxygen atom from the aldehyde is replaced by the carbon group from the ylide. The phosphorus atom from the ylide combines with the oxygen atom to form triphenylphosphine oxide as a by-product.\n3.  **Determine the Product Structure:**\n    *   The pivalaldehyde molecule is `(CH₃)₃C-CHO`. The reacting part is the `(CH₃)₃C-CH=` group.\n    *   The ylide is `Ph₃P=CH-CH₂(C₆H₄Cl)`. The reacting part is the `=CH-CH₂(C₆H₄Cl)` group.\n    *   Combining these two fragments at the double bond gives the product: `(CH₃)₃C-CH=CH-CH₂(C₆H₄Cl)`.\n4.  **Name the Product:** I will determine the systematic IUPAC name for the resulting alkene structure.\n5.  **Construct the Python Code:** The Python script will print the balanced chemical reaction, state the names of the products, and provide a breakdown of the IUPAC name for the main product, explaining the meaning of each number in the name as requested.\n\n```python\ndef solve_wittig_reaction():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines and explains the product of a Wittig reaction.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
