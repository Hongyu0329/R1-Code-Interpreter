# Define the numbers from the Roman numeral equation
num1 = 40
num2 = 300
num3 = 2161

# Calculate the result of the equation
# Following the order of operations (division then subtraction)
result = (num1 / num2) - num3

# Print the equation in modern numbers along with the solution
print(f"{num1} / {num2} - {num3} = {result}")
