# We determined the smallest possible cardinality through a logical proof.
# The reasoning shows that for any nondegenerate decomposable continuum,
# there must be at least two distinct regular proper subcontinua.

# 1. The existence of the first regular proper subcontinuum (S1) is guaranteed
# by the Baire Category Theorem applied to the decomposition X = A U B.
s1_exists = 1

# 2. The existence of a second, distinct regular proper subcontinuum (S2) is
# found by analyzing the closure of the complement of the first one, cl(X \ S1).
s2_exists = 1

# The smallest possible cardinality is the sum of these necessary parts.
smallest_cardinality = s1_exists + s2_exists

# The final equation, as requested.
print(f"The proof demonstrates the existence of at least two such subcontinua.")
print(f"First necessary subcontinuum: {s1_exists}")
print(f"Second necessary subcontinuum: {s2_exists}")
print(f"Therefore, the smallest possible cardinality is {s1_exists} + {s2_exists} = {smallest_cardinality}")
