    # Step 1: Define the problem and strategy.
    # We analyze the asymptotic speed of the leftmost particle in the branching random walk.
    # Let this speed be gamma(h). If gamma(h) > 0, the entire particle system drifts to +infinity,
    # meaning any fixed site is visited only finitely many times. In that case, the probability
    # of infinite visits to site 0 is 0.

    # Step 2: Analyze the system in the limit h -> 0.
    # As h -> 0, the probability of a site being red is 0, so the environment becomes entirely blue.
    # Also, the probability of branching is 0, so the process becomes a simple random walk.

    # Step 3: Define the parameters for the limiting random walk (h=0).
    # For a blue site, the probability of jumping right is p_R and left is p_L.

    # Step 4: Calculate the speed of the limiting random walk.
    # The speed is the expected displacement (drift) in one step.
    # E[Displacement] = (+1) * p_R + (-1) * p_L
