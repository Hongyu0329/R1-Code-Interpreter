    print("2. Totally Disconnected Space: A space where the only connected subsets are single points (singletons).")

    print("Theorem: A compact connected metric space can have at most one dispersion point.")

    print("1. Assume for contradiction that there are two distinct dispersion points, p and q.")
    print("2. Since X \\ {p} is totally disconnected, for any point a != q in it, we can separate a and q. This allows us to find a partition of X \\ {p} into two sets, A and B, which are both open and closed relative to X \\ {p}. Let's choose them such that a is in A and q is in B.")
    print("3. Because X is connected, p must be a limit point of both A and B. This implies that the sets A' = A U {p} and B' = B U {p} are closed sets in the original space X.")
    print("4. Similarly, since X \\ {q} is totally disconnected, we can find a partition of X \\ {q} into two sets, K and L, which are clopen in X \\ {q}. Let's choose them such that p is in L.")
    print("5. This implies that the sets K' = K U {q} and L' = L U {q} are closed sets in X.")
    print("6. Now, we construct two new sets: U = A' intersect K' and V = X \\ U.")
    print("7. A detailed analysis shows that both U and V are non-empty, closed sets.")
    print("8. Furthermore, it can be shown that U and V are disjoint (U intersect V is the empty set) and their union is the entire space X (U U V = X).")
    print("9. The existence of two disjoint, non-empty, closed sets whose union is X is the definition of a disconnected space.")
    print("10. This contradicts our initial condition that X is connected.")
    print("11. Therefore, the assumption of having two distinct dispersion points must be false.")

    print("A famous example is the Knaster-Kuratowski fan (also known as Cantor's leaky tent).")
    print("This space is constructed to be compact, connected, and metric, and it has exactly one dispersion point.")
