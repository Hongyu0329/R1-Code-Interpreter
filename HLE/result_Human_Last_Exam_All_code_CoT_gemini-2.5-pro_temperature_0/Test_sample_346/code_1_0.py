# Step 1: The problem asks to evaluate the church integer n from the expression:
# S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(S(S(K(S))(K))(I)))))(S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I))))

# Step 2: Simplify the expression by identifying known combinators.
# succ = S(S(K(S))(K))
# one = I
# two = S(I)(I)
# The expression becomes: n = S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(succ(one)))))(succ(two)))
# Since succ(one) is 2 and succ(two) is 3, this simplifies to:
# n = S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K 2))(3))

# Step 3: Use the reduction rule S I A B -> B (A B).
# Let's define the parts of the expression:
# Y = S I (K 2)
# X = S I Y 3
# n = S I X

# Step 4: Reduce the expression piece by piece.
# The term (Y 3) is (S I (K 2)) 3.
# Using the rule, this reduces to 3 ((K 2) 3).
# The term ((K 2) 3) reduces to 2.
# So, (Y 3) reduces to (3 2).

# Step 5: Evaluate the application of one Church numeral to another.
# The operation (m n) where m and n are Church numerals is equivalent to pow(n, m), or n^m.
# So, (3 2) is equal to 2^3.
val_y3 = 2**3
print(f"The sub-expression (S I (K 2)) 3 evaluates to 2^3 = {val_y3}")

# Step 6: Substitute this back.
# X reduces to (3 (Y 3)), which is (3 8).
# Using the exponentiation rule again, (3 8) is equal to 8^3.
val_x = val_y3**3
print(f"The sub-expression S(I)(S(I)(K 2))(3) evaluates to 8^3 = {val_x}")

# Step 7: Calculate the final value of n.
# n reduces to (S I X), which is (S I 512).
# The combinator (S I Z) is the successor function, so it evaluates to Z + 1.
n = val_x + 1
print(f"The full expression evaluates to n = 512 + 1 = {n}")

# Step 8: Calculate the final answer, log_2(n).
result = math.log2(n)
print(f"The final equation is log_2({n})")
print(f"The result of log_2({n}) is: {result}")
