    "To determine the number of let-7 family members identified in humans, I will perform the following steps:\n1.  Create a list containing the names of the mature human let-7 family microRNAs. This list is based on established biological databases like miRBase. The core members are let-7a, let-7b, let-7c, let-7d, let-7e, let-7f, let-7g, let-7i, and the closely related miR-98.\n2.  Calculate the total number of members by finding the length of the list.\n3.  Print each member's name. This fulfills the requirement to show the individual components leading to the final count.\n4.  Print the final calculated number.\n\n```python\ndef count_human_let7_family():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function lists the members of the human let-7 microRNA family\n    and prints the total count.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The let-7 family in humans consists of 9 distinct mature microRNAs.\n    # While some have multiple gene loci (e.g., let-7a-1, let-7a-2), they\n    # produce the same mature miRNA sequence. We count the distinct mature members.\n    # The list is based on information from primary miRNA databases (e.g., miRBase).\n    let7_family_members = [\n        \"let-7a\",\n        \"let-7b\",\n        \"let-7c\",\n        \"let-7d\",\n        \"let-7e\",\n        \"let-7f\",\n        \"let-7g\",\n        \"let-7i\",\n        \"miR-98\"  # miR-98 is considered a member of the let-7 family due to sequence homology.\n    ]\n\n    # Calculate the total number of members\n    count = len(let7_family_members)\n\n    print(\"The following members of the let-7 family have been identified in humans:\")\n    # This loop outputs each member, satisfying the \"output each number\" requirement\n    # by showing the individual items that contribute to the final sum.\n    for member in let7_family_members:\n        print(f\"- {member}\")\n\n    print(f\"\\nTotal count: {count}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    count_human_let7_family()\n```\n<<<9>>>"
