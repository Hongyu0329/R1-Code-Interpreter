# The problem is to find the cardinality of the coclassifier set for n=9.
# Based on the analysis of the structure of the coclassifier of the given functor,
# the cardinality is given by the formula (n!)^2.

# Set the value of n as specified in the problem.
n = 9

# Calculate n! (n factorial).
# The factorial of a non-negative integer n, denoted by n!,
# is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.
n_factorial = math.factorial(n)

# The cardinality of the coclassifier set is the square of n!.
result = n_factorial * n_factorial

# Print the explanation and the step-by-step calculation.
