# The user wants to identify the single grammatically incorrect sentence from a list.
# This is a logic puzzle that can be solved by deducing the language's grammar.
#
# Step 1: Analyze the word forms. We see pairs like 'Dokuje'/'Dokujet' and 'Ezsue'/'Ezsuet'.
# Let's hypothesize that the '-et' suffix marks the subject of a sentence.
#
# Step 2: Look for a rule governing sentences with multiple subjects.
# We identify all sentences that have two words ending in '-et':
#   - Sentence 7: Ezsuet kergoet esku otazsij kaij.
#   - Sentence 8: Kergoet dokujet esku otazsij kosaij.
#   - Sentence 11: Dokujet ezsuet esku otazsij kosaij.
#
# Step 3: A clear pattern emerges from these sentences. All correct sentences with two
# subjects (two '-et' words) also contain the word 'esku'. This implies a rule:
# "A sentence with two subjects must include the particle 'esku'."
#
# Step 4: Test all sentences against this rule. The rule holds for sentences 1 through 11.
# Now, we examine sentence 12:
#   - Sentence 12: Ketannet ezsuet otazsij gosa.
#
# Step 5: Sentence 12 has two subjects ('Ketannet' and 'ezsuet') but it does NOT contain
# the word 'esku'. This is a direct violation of the grammatical rule we discovered.
# Therefore, sentence 12 is the one that is not grammatically well-formed.

incorrect_sentence_number = 12

# The final equation is simply the number of the incorrect sentence.
print("The number of the sentence that isn't grammatically well-formed is:")
print(incorrect_sentence_number)
