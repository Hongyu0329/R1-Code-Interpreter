    # Phase A: Triggered Situational Interest
    # A student at this stage has a fleeting interest sparked by external stimuli.
    # Concrete feedback might be helpful, but the interest is not yet stable enough for the student
    # to be motivated to follow through on "next steps" for a long-term effect.
    print("Option A: Triggered Situational Interest")
    print("Analysis: The student's engagement is temporary. The feedback may not lead to long-term development as the initial interest itself is fragile and may fade quickly.\n")

    # Phase B: Maintained Situational Interest
    # A student here is engaged due to supportive external conditions (e.g., a group project, an engaging teacher).
    # Feedback is useful for completing the task at hand, but the interest is still dependent on the situation.
    # It helps maintain interest but doesn't guarantee the transition to a personal, individual interest.
    print("Option B: Maintained Situational Interest")
    print("Analysis: Feedback is effective for the current situation, but the interest is externally driven. The long-term impact is less certain.\n")

    # Phase C: Emerging Individual Interest
    # This is the crucial transition phase where interest starts to become internalized. The student begins to
    # see personal value and voluntarily seeks out more information. They are actively looking for ways to
    # build their competence. Concrete feedback with next steps is exactly what this student needs to
    # bridge the gap between their budding interest and the skills needed to pursue it independently.
    # This support is critical for solidifying the interest for the long term.
    print("Option C: Emerging Individual Interest")
    print("Analysis: This student is actively trying to build personal competence. Concrete, actionable feedback provides the perfect scaffold to turn a budding interest into a stable, self-driven one. This has the most significant long-term impact.\n")

    # Phase D: Well-Developed Individual Interest
    # A student at this stage already has a deep, self-sustaining interest. They can generate their own
    # goals and next steps. While feedback is still valuable, it is not as critical for the fundamental
    # *development* of their interest, which is already robust.
    print("Option D: Well-Developed Individual Interest")
    print("Analysis: The student is already self-regulating. Feedback is helpful, but the interest is already well-established, so the feedback has less of a formative, developmental impact.\n")

    # Option E: Good for every student
    # While true that this feedback is generally helpful, the question asks for the stage where it has the
    # *most significant long-term impact*. The effect is not uniform across all stages.
    print("Option E: Good for every student")
    print("Analysis: This statement is too general and ignores the differential impact of feedback based on the student's developmental stage.\n")
