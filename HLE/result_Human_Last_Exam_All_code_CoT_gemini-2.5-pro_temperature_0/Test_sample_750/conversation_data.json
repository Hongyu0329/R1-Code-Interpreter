    "To solve the complex equation $z \\cdot i = i^z$, we need to handle the multi-valued nature of the complex power $i^z$.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Express $i^z$ using the complex logarithm:** The expression $a^b$ for complex numbers $a, b$ is defined as $e^{b \\log a}$. The complex logarithm $\\log a$ is multi-valued. For $a=i$, we have:\n    $\\log i = \\ln|i| + i \\cdot \\arg(i) = \\ln(1) + i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi) = i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)$, where $k$ is any integer. Each value of $k$ defines a different branch of the power function.\n2.  **Rewrite the equation:** The original equation becomes $z \\cdot i = e^{z \\cdot \\log i} = e^{z \\cdot i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)}$.\n3.  **Search for solutions:** We will look for solutions of different forms.\n    *   **Real solutions ($z=x$):** By substituting $z=x$ and equating the real and imaginary parts of the equation, we can find that $z=1$ and $z=-1$ are solutions.\n    *   **Purely imaginary solutions ($z=yi$):** By substituting $z=yi$, we get a transcendental equation for $y$. We can show that solutions for $y$ exist for $k \\le -1$ and find them numerically.\n4.  **Implement in Python:** The Python script will find the two real solutions and the principal purely imaginary solution (corresponding to $k=-1$) and verify them. For the imaginary solution, we will use a numerical solver from the `scipy` library.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport cmath\nfrom scipy.optimize import fsolve\n\ndef solve_and_verify():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds and verifies solutions to the equation z*i = i^z.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Solving the equation z*i = i^z for complex numbers z.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    # --- Part 1: Real Solutions ---\n    # By analysis, we found two real solutions, z=1 and z=-1.\n    # These solutions hold true for any integer branch k of the complex logarithm.\n    \n    print(\"Found a real solution: z = 1\")\n    z1 = 1\n    # For z=1, the equation is (1)*i = i^(1)\n    # We use k=0 for the principal value, but it holds for any k.\n    log_i_k0 = 1j * (np.pi/2 + 2*0*np.pi)\n    lhs1 = z1 * 1j\n    rhs1 = cmath.exp(z1 * log_i_k0)\n    print(f\"Verifying the equation for z = {z1}:\")\n    print(f\"({z1}) * i = {lhs1}\")\n    print(f\"i^({z1}) = {rhs1}\")\n    print(f\"The equation holds: {np.isclose(lhs1, rhs1)}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    print(\"Found another real solution: z = -1\")\n    z2 = -1\n    # For z=-1, the equation is (-1)*i = i^(-1)\n    lhs2 = z2 * 1j\n    rhs2 = cmath.exp(z2 * log_i_k0)\n    print(f\"Verifying the equation for z = {z2}:\")\n    print(f\"({z2}) * i = {lhs2}\")\n    print(f\"i^({z2}) = {rhs2}\")\n    print(f\"The equation holds: {np.isclose(lhs2, rhs2)}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    # --- Part 2: Purely Imaginary Solutions ---\n    # A purely imaginary solution z = yi must satisfy -y = exp(-y * (pi/2 + 2*k*pi)).\n    # Solutions for y exist only for k <= -1.
