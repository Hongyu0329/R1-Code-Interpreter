    "To determine the value of \\(av_{333}^3(1324)\\), we need to find the number of permutations of length 333 with exactly 3 inversions that avoid the pattern 1324.\n\nAn inversion in a permutation \\(\\pi\\) is a pair of indices \\((i, j)\\) such that \\(i < j\\) and \\(\\pi_i > \\pi_j\\). A permutation \\(\\pi\\) contains the pattern 1324 if there exist four indices \\(a < b < c < d\\) such that \\(\\pi_a < \\pi_c < \\pi_b < \\pi_d\\).\n\nFor a permutation to have a 1324 pattern, there must be an inversion \\((b, c)\\) that is \"sandwiched\" by two other elements \\(\\pi_a\\) and \\(\\pi_d\\) in a specific way. That is, for an inversion \\((b, c)\\), if we can find an index \\(a < b\\) and an index \\(d > c\\) such that \\(\\pi_a < \\pi_c\\) and \\(\\pi_b < \\pi_d\\), then a 1324 pattern is formed.\n\nSince the number of inversions (k=3) is very small compared to the length of the permutation (n=333), the permutation must be very close to the identity permutation (1, 2, 3, ..., 333). The elements that are not in their natural positions (i.e., \\(\\pi_i \\neq i\\)) are called the \"support\" of the permutation. For such \"nearly sorted\" permutations, any 1324 pattern is typically formed when the support of the permutation is \"internal\", allowing us to pick fixed points from before and after the support to form the pattern.\n\nTo avoid the 1324 pattern, the permutation's support must be located at the extremities of the sequence. We find that for k=3, the support must either be a single contiguous block of indices, or be split into two disjoint blocks located at the beginning and the end of the permutation.\n\nLet's analyze these two cases for n=333:\n\n### Case 1: The support is a single contiguous block of indices.\n\nThe permutations with 3 inversions whose support is a contiguous block are based on \"core\" permutations of a small number of elements. We find three types of such core permutations that avoid 1324:\n1.  **Core permutation `321` on 3 elements**: This corresponds to a permutation like `...c, b, a...` on adjacent indices `{i, i+1, i+2}`. This structure has 3 inversions. It avoids the 1324 pattern only if it's placed at the beginning (`i=1`) or at the end (`i=n-2`).\n    *   `3, 2, 1, 4, 5, ...`\n    *   `1, 2, ..., 330, 333, 332, 331`\n    This gives 2 such permutations.\n\n2.  **Core permutation `1432` on 4 elements**: This corresponds to a permutation like `...a, d, c, b...` on adjacent indices `{i, i+1, i+2, i+3}`. This structure has 3 inversions. It avoids the 1324 pattern only if it's placed at the very end (`i=n-3`).\n    *   `1, 2, ..., 329, 330, 333, 332, 331`\n    This gives 1 such permutation.\n\n3.  **Core permutation `4123` on 4 elements**: This corresponds to a permutation like `...d, a, b, c...` on adjacent indices `{i, i+1, i+2, i+3}`. This structure has 3 inversions. It avoids the 1324 pattern only if it's placed at the beginning (`i=1`) or at the end (`i=n-3`).\n    *   `4, 1, 2, 3, 5, ...`\n    *   `1, 2, ..., 329, 333, 330, 331, 332`\n    This gives 2 such permutations.\n\nIn total, for Case 1, we have \\(2 + 1 + 2 = 5\\) permutations.\n\n### Case 2: The support is in two disjoint blocks at the ends.\n\nTo have 3 inversions, the permutation must be composed of a simple swap (1 inversion) at one end and a block with 2 inversions at the other end.\n1.  **Swap at the beginning, 2-inversion block at the end**: The swap is `(1,2)`. The 2-inversion block on `{n-2, n-1, n}` can be of two types (`...c,a,b...` or `...b,c,a...`). Both avoid the 1324 pattern.\n    *   `2, 1, 3, ..., 330, 333, 331, 332`\n    *   `2, 1, 3, ..., 331, 333, 332, 330` (This is not the right structure, the correct one is `2, 1, ..., 331, 330, 333`)\n    This gives 2 such permutations.\n\n2.  **2-inversion block at the beginning, swap at the end**: The swap is `(n-1, n)`. The 2-inversion block is on `{1, 2, 3}`. Symmetrically, this also gives 2 permutations.\n    *   `2, 3, 1, 4, ..., 331, 333, 332`\n    *   `3, 1, 2, 4, ..., 331, 333, 332`\n\nIn total, for Case 2, we have \\(2 + 2 = 4\\) permutations.\n\nCombining both cases, the total number of 1324-avoiding permutations of length 333 with 3 inversions is the sum of the counts from each case.\n\n```python\n# Plan:\n# 1.
