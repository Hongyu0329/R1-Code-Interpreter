    "An isometric embedding is a function $f$ from a metric space $(X, d_X)$ to another metric space $(Y, d_Y)$ that preserves distances, i.e., for any two points $x_1, x_2 \\in X$, we have $d_Y(f(x_1), f(x_2)) = d_X(x_1, x_2)$. In our case, $X$ is a finite ultrametric space and the target space is a Banach space $B$, whose distance is given by the norm: $d_B(v_1, v_2) = \\|v_1 - v_2\\|_B$.\n\nThe question asks for the smallest possible number of such embeddings. This number can be 0 if, for some choice of $X$ and $B$, no such embedding exists. Let's investigate if this is possible.\n\n1.  **Consider a simple finite ultrametric space.** Let $X$ be a space with two points, $x_1$ and $x_2$. For $X$ to be non-trivial, the distance between them must be positive. Let's set the distance $d(x_1, x_2) = 1$. This space is ultrametric because any three points from $\\{x_1, x_2\\}$ must include a repeated point, making the ultrametric inequality ($d(x,z) \\le \\max(d(x,y), d(y,z))$) trivially true.\n\n2.  **Consider a simple Banach space.** A vector space containing only the zero vector, $B = \\{0\\}$, is the simplest Banach space. Its norm is $\\|0\\| = 0$. The cardinality of this space is $K=1$.\n\n3.  **Check for isometric embeddings.** An isometric embedding $f: X \\to B$ must satisfy the condition $\\|f(x_1) - f(x_2)\\|_B = d(x_1, x_2)$.\n    *   Since the only point in $B$ is $0$, any map $f$ must have $f(x_1) = 0$ and $f(x_2) = 0$.\n    *   The left side of the condition becomes $\\|f(x_1) - f(x_2)\\|_B = \\|0 - 0\\|_B = 0$.\n    *   The right side of the condition is $d(x_1, x_2) = 1$.\n    *   So, for an embedding to exist, we must have $0 = 1$, which is a contradiction.\n\n4.  **Conclusion.** No isometric embedding exists for this choice of $X$ and $B$. Therefore, the number of embeddings is 0. Since the number of embeddings cannot be negative, 0 is the smallest possible number.\n\nThe following Python code demonstrates this reasoning.\n\n```python\ndef solve_embedding_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function demonstrates that the smallest possible number of isometric\n    embeddings from a finite ultrametric space X to a Banach space B is 0.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # 1.
