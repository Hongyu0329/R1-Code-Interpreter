    "To determine the Szeged/Wiener index ratio for the major reduction product of di(perylene-3-yl) disulfide, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the Molecule**: The reduction of a disulfide (R-S-S-R) yields two equivalents of the corresponding thiol (R-SH). Therefore, the major reduction product of di(perylene-3-yl) disulfide is perylene-3-thiol (C₂₀H₁₁SH).\n\n2.  **Create a Molecular Graph**: We will represent the perylene-3-thiol molecule as a graph where atoms are vertices and covalent bonds are edges. Crucially, all hydrogen atoms will be included as specified in the problem. We will use the RDKit library to generate this graph from a SMILES string, which is a standard way to represent chemical structures.\n\n3.  **Calculate Wiener Index (W)**: The Wiener index is the sum of the shortest path distances between all pairs of vertices in the graph. We will use the `networkx` library to compute this.\n\n4.  **Calculate Szeged Index (Sz)**: The Szeged index is calculated by summing the product `n_u * n_v` for every edge `(u, v)` in the graph. Here, `n_u` is the number of vertices closer to vertex `u` than to `v`, and `n_v` is the number of vertices closer to `v` than to `u`.\n\n5.  **Compute the Ratio**: Finally, we will calculate the ratio of the Szeged index to the Wiener index (Sz / W).\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan. You will need to have the `rdkit-pypi` and `networkx` libraries installed. You can install them using pip: `pip install rdkit-pypi networkx`.\n\n```python\nimport networkx as nx\nfrom rdkit import Chem\n\ndef solve_molecular_indices():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script calculates the Wiener and Szeged indices for perylene-3-thiol,\n    including all hydrogen atoms, and then computes their ratio.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the molecule using its SMILES string.\n    # The molecule is perylene-3-thiol (C20H11SH).\n    smiles = 'C1=CC=C2C3=C4C=CC5=C(C=C(C=C5)S)C4=C(C=C2)C2=C(C=CC=C12)C3'\n\n    # Step 2: Create a molecular graph including hydrogens.\n    # Create an RDKit molecule object from the SMILES string.\n    mol = Chem.MolFromSmiles(smiles)\n    # Add hydrogen atoms to the molecule.\n    mol_h = Chem.AddHs(mol)\n\n    # Convert the RDKit molecule to a NetworkX graph.\n    G = nx.Graph()\n    for atom in mol_h.GetAtoms():\n        G.add_node(atom.GetIdx())\n    for bond in mol_h.GetBonds():\n        G.add_edge(bond.GetBeginAtomIdx(), bond.GetEndAtomIdx())\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate the Wiener Index (W).\n    # The Wiener index is the sum of shortest path distances over all pairs of vertices.\n    W = nx.wiener_index(G)\n\n    # Step 4: Calculate the Szeged Index (Sz).\n    sz = 0\n    # Pre-calculate all-pairs shortest paths for efficiency.\n    path_lengths = dict(nx.all_pairs_shortest_path_length(G))\n\n    # Iterate over each edge (u, v) in the graph.\n    for u, v in G.edges():\n        n_u = 0\n        n_v = 0\n        # For the current edge, iterate through all vertices w to partition them.\n        for w in G.nodes():\n            dist_u = path_lengths[w][u]\n            dist_v = path_lengths[w][v]\n            if dist_u < dist_v:\n                n_u += 1\n            elif dist_v < dist_u:\n                n_v += 1\n        # The contribution of the edge (u, v) is n_u * n_v.\n        sz += n_u * n_v\n\n    # Step 5: Compute and print the final ratio.\n    if W != 0:\n        ratio = sz / W\n    else:\n        ratio = 0\n\n    print(\"Molecule: Perylene-3-thiol (C20H11SH)\")\n    print(f\"Total atoms (vertices): {G.number_of_nodes()}\")\n    print(f\"Total bonds (edges): {G.number_of_edges()}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    print(f\"Szeged Index (Sz) = {sz}\")\n    print(f\"Wiener Index (W) = {W}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    print(f\"Szeged/Wiener Ratio = {sz} / {W} = {ratio}\")\n\nsolve_molecular_indices()\n<<<3.2114593225704337>>>"
