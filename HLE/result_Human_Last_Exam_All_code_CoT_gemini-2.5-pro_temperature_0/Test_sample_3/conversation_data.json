    "To find the largest order of a non-cyclic torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve over the number field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify Possible Torsion Structures:** The possible structures of torsion subgroups of elliptic curves over quadratic number fields have been completely classified by the work of mathematicians like Kenku, Momose, Kamienny, and others. We will use the known classification for the specific field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$.\n\n2.  **Filter for Non-Cyclic Groups:** A torsion subgroup, which is a finite abelian group of the form $\\mathbb{Z}/m\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z}$ with $m$ dividing $n$, is non-cyclic if and only if $m > 1$. We will list all such possible groups for elliptic curves over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$.\n\n3.  **Calculate Orders:** For each possible non-cyclic group structure, we will calculate its order. The order of $\\mathbb{Z}/m\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z}$ is simply $m \\times n$.\n\n4.  **Find the Maximum:** We will then identify the largest order among all the possible non-cyclic torsion subgroups.\n\nThe known possible non-cyclic torsion subgroups $E(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3}))_{\\text{tors}}$ are:\n*   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/2N\\mathbb{Z}$ for $N \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\\}$\n*   $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/3N\\mathbb{Z}$ for $N \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$\n*   $\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$\n*   $\\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$\n\nThe following Python code will systematically calculate the order for each of these groups and find the maximum.\n\n```python\ndef find_largest_torsion_order():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the largest order of a non-cyclic torsion subgroup of an\n    elliptic curve over Q(sqrt(-3)) based on the known classification.\n    \"\"\"\n    # List of possible non-cyclic torsion groups, represented as pairs (m, n)\n    # for the group structure Z/mZ x Z/nZ.\n    # This list is derived from the complete classification of torsion subgroups\n    # of elliptic curves over Q(sqrt(-3)).\n    \n    # Groups of the form Z/2Z x Z/2NZ for N in {1, ..., 7}\n    groups_2n = [(2, 2 * n) for n in range(1, 8)]\n    \n    # Groups of the form Z/3Z x Z/3NZ for N in {1, 2, 3}\n    groups_3n = [(3, 3 * n) for n in range(1, 4)]\n    \n    # Other possible non-cyclic groups\n    other_groups = [(4, 4), (6, 6)]\n    \n    all_non_cyclic_groups = groups_2n + groups_3n + other_groups\n    \n    max_order = 0\n    group_with_max_order = None\n    \n    print(\"Calculating the order for each possible non-cyclic torsion group:\")\n    \n    for m, n in all_non_cyclic_groups:\n        order = m * n\n        print(f\"The group Z/{m}Z x Z/{n}Z has order {m} * {n} = {order}\")\n        if order > max_order:\n            max_order = order\n            group_with_max_order = (m, n)\n            \n    print(\"\\n--------------------------------------------------\")\n    print(f\"The largest order found is {max_order}, corresponding to the group Z/{group_with_max_order[0]}Z x Z/{group_with_max_order[1]}Z.\")\n    print(\"--------------------------------------------------\")\n    print(f\"The final answer is {max_order}\")\n\nfind_largest_torsion_order()\n```\n<<<36>>>"
