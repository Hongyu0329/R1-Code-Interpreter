# Part 1: Count compiler errors in the provided C code.
# Line 3: `unsigned long long` is not a valid type in XVM. (Error 1)

# Part 2: Calculate the minimum memory usage in an optimized program.
# The most memory-efficient version only needs variables for the inputs n, m, and a.
# n requires unsigned long (12D) because 4*10^9 is larger than the max of unsigned int (999,999).
# m requires unsigned long (12D) for the same reason.
# a requires unsigned int (6D) because a < 10^6, which fits within 0-999,999.
min_memory_in_D = 12 + 12 + 6

# Part 3: Determine if the problem can be solved without branching.
# Yes, by using integer arithmetic to calculate the ceiling of a division.
# ceil(x/y) can be calculated as (x + y - 1) // y, which avoids 'if' statements.
can_be_solved_without_branching = "Y"

# Part 4: Calculate the expected output for n = 4*10^9, m = 4*10^9, a = 1.
n = 4 * 10**9
m = 4 * 10**9
a = 1

# Calculate the number of flagstones for each dimension using ceiling division.
# Python's integer division `//` is used here.
flagstones_n = (n + a - 1) // a
flagstones_m = (m + a - 1) // a

# Calculate the total number of flagstones. Python handles large integers automatically.
total_flagstones = flagstones_n * flagstones_m
