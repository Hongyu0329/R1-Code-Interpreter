# This puzzle requires identifying a famous historical quote and related facts.
# 1. The quote "He is a X with his own Y!" refers to Winston Churchill's (Z)
#    comment about John Foster Dulles (W): "He is the only bull (X) I know
#    who carries his own china shop (Y) with him."
# 2. Churchill (Z) was famously nicknamed the "British Bulldog" (XK), which fits
#    the clue about being called an "XK".
# 3. The "K puns" (bulldog) lead to the food "bulgogi" (AK), a well-known dish
#    from "Korea" (G).
# 4. Option A correctly identifies all these elements:
#    Z = Churchill, W = Dulles, X = bull, Y = China shop, XK = bulldog,
#    AK = bulgogi, G = Korea.
# 5. The other options contain inaccuracies, most notably in the wording of the
#    idiom "China shop".

# The final answer is A.
