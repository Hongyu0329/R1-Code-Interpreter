    "To find the total welfare, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Find Market Equilibrium:** The market is in equilibrium when the quantity supplied equals the quantity demanded (`Q_S = Q_D = Q_e`). This happens at the price (`P_e`) where the supply and demand curves intersect. We will find this equilibrium point (`Q_e`, `P_e`) by setting the supply and demand equations equal to each other and solving for `Q_e` numerically.\n2.  **Define Total Welfare:** Total welfare is the sum of consumer surplus and producer surplus. Geometrically, it is the area between the demand curve and the supply curve, up to the equilibrium quantity.\n3.  **Calculate Total Welfare:** We can calculate total welfare by taking the integral of the demand function from 0 to `Q_e` and subtracting the integral of the supply function over its defined range up to `Q_e`.\n    *   Total Welfare = `∫ D(Q) dQ - ∫ S(Q) dQ`\n    *   The demand integral is from `0` to `Q_e`.\n    *   The supply function `P = ln(Q^3 - 2)` is defined for `Q^3 - 2 > 0`, which means `Q > 2^(1/3)`. So, its integral is from `2^(1/3)` to `Q_e`.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan using the `scipy` library for numerical calculations.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import fsolve\nfrom scipy.integrate import quad\n\n# Step 1: Define the supply and demand functions\n# Supply: P = ln(Q^3 - 2)\ndef supply_price(Q):\n    # The function is defined for Q^3 - 2 > 0.\n    # We need to handle cases where the argument to log is non-positive for the solver.\n    if np.any(Q**3 - 2 <= 0):\n        # Return a large value to push the solver away from this invalid region\n        return 1e9\n    return np.log(Q**3 - 2)\n\n# Demand: P = 18 * e^(-arctan(Q))\ndef demand_price(Q):\n    return 18 * np.exp(-np.arctan(Q))\n\n# Step 2: Find the market equilibrium\n# Equilibrium occurs when supply price equals demand price.\n# We need to find the root of the equation: demand_price(Q) - supply_price(Q) = 0\ndef equilibrium_equation(Q):\n    return demand_price(Q) - supply_price(Q)\n\n# Provide an initial guess for the solver. A quick check shows the\n# equilibrium quantity is likely between 3 and 4.\ninitial_guess = 3.5\n# fsolve returns an array, so we take the first element\nQ_e = fsolve(equilibrium_equation, initial_guess)[0]\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the components for the total welfare equation\n# The integral of the demand curve is from Q=0 to Q_e\nintegral_demand, _ = quad(demand_price, 0, Q_e)\n\n# The supply curve is only defined for Q > 2^(1/3).\n# So, the integral of the supply curve is from Q_start = 2^(1/3) to Q=Q_e.\nQ_supply_start = np.cbrt(2)\nintegral_supply, _ = quad(supply_price, Q_supply_start, Q_e)\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the final total welfare\ntotal_welfare = integral_demand - integral_supply\n\n# Step 5: Print the final equation with all its components\nprint(\"The total welfare is calculated as the area between the demand and supply curves.\")\nprint(\"Total Welfare = (Integral of Demand) - (Integral of Supply)\")\nprint(\"\\nHere are the numbers for the final equation:\")\nprint(f\"Integral of Demand from 0 to Q_e={Q_e:.4f}: {integral_demand:.4f}\")\nprint(f\"Integral of Supply from Q_start={Q_supply_start:.4f} to Q_e={Q_e:.4f}: {integral_supply:.4f}\")\nprint(\"\\nFinal Equation:\")\nprint(f\"Total Welfare = {integral_demand:.4f} - {integral_supply:.4f} = {total_welfare:.4f}\")\n\n<<<21.0399>>>\n```"
