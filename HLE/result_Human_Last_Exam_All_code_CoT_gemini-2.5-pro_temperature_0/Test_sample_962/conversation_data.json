    "Here is a design for a tightly secure t-out-of-n threshold signature scheme with a two-round signing protocol, followed by a Python implementation that simulates the scheme's core logic.\n\n### Design: Two-Round BLS Threshold Signature Scheme\n\nThe proposed scheme is based on the Boneh-Lynn-Shacham (BLS) signature scheme, which is exceptionally well-suited for threshold applications due to its algebraic properties. The security of this scheme is tightly related to the hardness of the Computational Diffie-Hellman (CDH) problem in cryptographic groups with bilinear pairings.\n\n**Core Components:**\n\n1.  **Shamir's Secret Sharing (SSS):** This is used to split the master private key. A `(t-1)`-degree polynomial `f(z)` is created where the master private key `x` is the constant term, i.e., `f(0) = x`. Each of the `n` parties receives a share `x_i = f(i)`. Any `t` shares can be used to reconstruct the original secret `x`, but any `t-1` shares reveal no information about it.\n2.  **BLS Signatures:** A standard BLS signature on a message `m` is `σ = H(m)^x`, where `x` is the private key and `H` is a hash function that maps the message to a point on an elliptic curve. Verification involves checking if a pairing equation holds: `e(σ, g) == e(H(m), P)`, where `P = g^x` is the public key, `g` is a generator, and `e` is a bilinear map.\n3.  **Lagrange Interpolation:** This mathematical technique allows for the reconstruction of the polynomial `f(z)` from any `t` points (shares). In our case, we use it in the exponent to combine partial signatures into a final, valid signature without ever reconstructing the master private key `x` itself.\n\n**Protocol Phases:**\n\n1.  **Setup Phase (Distributed Key Generation):**\n    *   A trusted dealer (or a more complex Distributed Key Generation protocol) generates the master private key `x` and the corresponding public key `P = g^x`.\n    *   The dealer uses SSS to create `n` private key shares `x_1, x_2, ..., x_n` from `x`.\n    *   Each party `i` securely receives its share `x_i` and computes its public verification key `P_i = g^{x_i}`.\n\n2.  **Signing Protocol (Two Rounds):**\n    Let's assume a set `S` of `t` parties is available to sign a message `m`.\n\n    *   **Round 1: Partial Signature Generation & Broadcast**\n        *   Each participating party `i ∈ S` computes its partial signature on the message `m` using its private key share `x_i`.\n        *   The partial signature is `σ_i = H(m)^{x_i}`.\n        *   Each party then broadcasts its partial signature `σ_i` to the other participants or to a designated aggregator. This round is performed in parallel by all signers.\n\n    *   **Round 2: Signature Aggregation**\n        *   An aggregator (which can be any party) collects at least `t` partial signatures `{σ_i | i ∈ S}`.\n        *   The aggregator computes the Lagrange coefficient `λ_i` for each signer `i ∈ S`. The coefficient is calculated as `λ_i = ∏_{j∈S, j≠i} j / (j - i)`.\n        *   The aggregator combines the partial signatures to produce the final signature `σ` using the formula:\n            `σ = ∏_{i ∈ S} (σ_i)^{λ_i}`\n        *   This final `σ` is a valid BLS signature for the master public key `P`, as `σ = H(m)^x`.\n\nThis design is highly secure and efficient. The signing protocol is non-interactive from the signers' perspective (they just broadcast their part), which constitutes the first round. The second round is a simple computation by an aggregator that does not require any further secret information.\n\n### Python Implementation\n\nThe following Python code simulates the BLS threshold signature scheme using modular arithmetic to represent the underlying group operations. This demonstrates the core principles without the complexity of implementing elliptic curve pairings.\n\n```python\nimport random\nimport functools\n\n# This is a simulation.
