    "To determine the standard Japanese pitch accent pattern of 「弟」 (otouto), I will use a Python script. My plan is as follows:\n\n1.  Create a Python dictionary that acts as a small database of Japanese words and their corresponding pitch accent patterns. This dictionary will include the target word 「弟」 and a few other examples for context.\n2.  The script will look up the word 「弟」 in this dictionary.\n3.  It will then print the word, its reading, its pitch accent pattern type (e.g., Heiban), and a brief explanation of that pattern.\n4.  Finally, it will identify which of the given answer choices corresponds to the found pattern.\n\n```python\ndef find_pitch_accent(word):\n    \"\"\"\n    Simulates looking up a word's pitch accent in a Japanese dictionary.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A small database of pitch accent patterns.\n    # L = Low pitch, H = High pitch\n    # The notation [n] indicates the position of the pitch drop.\n    # [0] = Heiban (平板): LHHHH... (no drop within the word)\n    # [1] = Atamadaka (頭高): HLLLL... (drop after the 1st mora)\n    # [2], [3], etc. = Nakadaka (中高): LHLL..., LHHLL... (drop in the middle)\n    # Odaka (尾高) is when the drop occurs after the last mora, on the particle.\n    pitch_accent_db = {\n        \"弟\": {\n            \"reading\": \"おとうと (o-to-u-to)\",\n            \"pattern_type\": \"Heiban\",\n            \"pattern_number\": 0,\n            \"explanation\": \"The pitch starts low, rises on the second mora, and stays high.
