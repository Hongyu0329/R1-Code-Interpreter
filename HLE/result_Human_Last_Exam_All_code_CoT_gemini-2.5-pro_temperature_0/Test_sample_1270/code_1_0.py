# Plan:
# 1. Define the number of carbons in a benzene ring.
# 2. Define the number of points in the Mercedes logo, representing additional carbons.
# 3. Sum these numbers to get the total carbon count for "mercedesbenzene".
# 4. Print the logic and the final calculation.

# Number of carbons in the core benzene structure
carbons_in_benzene_ring = 6

# The "Mercedes" part of the name implies a 3-pointed star,
# which we interpret as 3 additional single-carbon groups.
carbons_from_mercedes_points = 3

# Calculate the total number of carbons
total_carbons = carbons_in_benzene_ring + carbons_from_mercedes_points

print(f"The molecule 'mercedesbenzene' is imagined as a benzene ring ({carbons_in_benzene_ring} carbons) with three additional carbons representing the Mercedes logo's three points.")
print(f"The total number of carbons is the sum of the carbons from the benzene ring and the points.")
print(f"Total carbons = {carbons_in_benzene_ring} + {carbons_from_mercedes_points} = {total_carbons}")
