    "To find the computational time complexity of the `IMAG(n, c)` algorithm, we need to analyze how the number of elementary operations grows with the size of the input `n`.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n1.  **Initialization (Step 1):**\n    The first step involves a fixed number of assignments and arithmetic operations (`i := 0`, `x := n`, `q := ⌊x/c⌋`, `a_0 := x - qc`). These operations take a constant amount of time, regardless of the value of `n`. We can denote this as O(1).\n\n2.  **The `while` loop (Step 2):**\n    The core of the algorithm is the `while` loop, which continues as long as `q > 0`. The runtime of the algorithm is determined by how many times this loop executes.\n\n3.  **Analyzing the loop variable `q`:**\n    -   Before the loop, `q` is initialized to `⌊n/c⌋`.\n    -   Inside each iteration of the loop, `x` is updated to the current `q`, and then a new `q` is calculated as `q := ⌊x/c⌋`.\n    -   This means that in every iteration, the value of `q` is integer-divided by the base `c`. The value of `q` decreases exponentially.\n\n4.  **Counting the Iterations:**\n    The loop will stop when `q` becomes 0. The number of times you can divide `n` by `c` before the result is less than 1 is given by the logarithm base `c` of `n`, which is `log_c(n)`. The number of iterations is precisely `⌊log_c(n)⌋`. Therefore, the loop runs `O(log_c(n))` times.\n\n5.  **Work per Iteration:**\n    Inside the loop, a fixed number of elementary operations are performed: one increment, one assignment, one division, one multiplication, and one subtraction. The cost of these operations is constant and does not depend on `n` or `c`. So, the work done inside each iteration is O(1).\n\n6.  **Total Complexity:**\n    The total time complexity is the number of loop iterations multiplied by the cost of the work done in each iteration.\n    Total Complexity = (Number of Iterations) × (Work per Iteration)\n    Total Complexity = `O(log_c(n))` × `O(1)`\n    Total Complexity = `O(log_c(n))`\n\nThe following Python code will print the final conclusion.\n\n```python\ndef print_complexity_analysis():\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints the computational time complexity of the IMAG(n, c) algorithm.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The final equation for the time complexity\n    final_equation = \"O(log_c(n))\"\n    \n    print(\"The computational time complexity of the algorithm is:\")\n    print(final_equation)\n    \n    print(\"\\nExplanation of the components in the final equation:\")\n    \n    # Outputting each \"number\" or component of the final equation\n    component_O = \"O\"\n    component_log = \"log\"\n    component_c = \"c\"\n    component_n = \"n\"\n    \n    print(f\"'{component_O}': Stands for 'Order of' (Big O notation), which describes the upper bound of the algorithm's growth rate.\")\n    print(f\"'{component_log}': Represents the logarithm function. The runtime grows logarithmically, not linearly, with the input 'n'.\")\n    print(f\"'{component_c}': Represents the base. The number of iterations depends on the base 'c' used for the representation.\")\n    print(f\"'{component_n}': Represents the input number.
