def solve_tt_ideals():
    """
    This function solves the problem by determining which objects generate prime tt-ideals
    and counting the number of prime ideals not generated by any of the given objects.

    The analysis of the tensor-triangulated category K = D_b(E(C_p)) reveals the following:
    - The prime tt-ideals of K consist of the zero ideal {0} and a set of maximal ideals P_lambda,
      parametrized by the points lambda of the projective line P^1(k).
    - An object generates a prime ideal if its support is a single point in the tt-spectrum.
      This means we are looking for objects supported at exactly one point lambda in P^1(k).

    Analysis of the objects' supports:
    - 7. cone(tau): Supported at a single point lambda_tau determined by tau. Generates P_{lambda_tau}.
    - 8. cone(tau)^2: Support is Z(cone(tau)) cap Z(cone(tau)) = {lambda_tau}. Generates P_{lambda_tau}.
    - 9. cone(tau)^(p-1): Similarly, supported at {lambda_tau}. Generates P_{lambda_tau}.
    - 10. cone(tau)^p: Similarly, supported at {lambda_tau}. Generates P_{lambda_tau}.
    - 12. rad(kC_p) tensor cone(tau): Z(rad(kC_p)) is all of P^1(k). The intersection with Z(cone(tau))
      is {lambda_tau}. Generates P_{lambda_tau}.
    - 18. S tensor cone(tau): Z(S) is all of P^1(k). The intersection with Z(cone(tau))
      is {lambda_tau}. Generates P_{lambda_tau}.

    Other objects either have support that is empty, contains multiple points, or the entire space,
    or their support depends on a specific choice of tau in a way that doesn't guarantee it's a single point.
    For example, Z(gap^1(...)) is {0, infinity}, so its tensor product with cone(tau) has a single-point
    support only if lambda_tau is 0 or infinity, which is not true for a general tau.

    The list of objects that generate a prime tt-ideal is therefore [7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 18].

    For the second question:
    - The set of all prime ideals is {0} U {P_lambda | lambda in P^1(k)}.
    - The objects listed above can generate any P_lambda by choosing the appropriate tau.
    - Thus, the set of generated prime ideals is {P_lambda | lambda in P^1(k)}.
    - The only prime ideal not generated by any of these objects is the zero ideal, {0}.
    - The count of such ideals is 1.
