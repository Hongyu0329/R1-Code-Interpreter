    "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of equivalence classes of quadratic forms in two variables over the ring $R = \\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$. This is a classic algebraic problem that can be solved computationally by partitioning the set of all such quadratic forms into equivalence classes under the action of the general linear group $GL_2(R)$.\n\nA quadratic form $Q(x, y) = ax^2 + bxy + cy^2$ is defined by three coefficients $(a, b, c)$ from $R$. Two forms, $Q_1$ and $Q_2$, are equivalent if there exists an invertible linear transformation $T \\in GL_2(R)$ such that $Q_2(v) = Q_1(T(v))$ for all vectors $v=(x,y)$.\n\nMy plan is to implement an algorithm to count these equivalence classes directly:\n1.  **Represent Forms and Transformations**: A quadratic form is represented by a tuple of its coefficients `(a, b, c)`. A linear transformation is a 2x2 matrix with entries in $R$.\n2.  **Generate the Group of Transformations**: First, I will generate all invertible 2x2 matrices over $R=\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$, which form the group $GL_2(\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z})$. A matrix is invertible if and only if its determinant is a unit in $R$. The units in $\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$ are $\\{1, 3, 5, 7\\}$.\n3.  **Iterate and Classify**: I will iterate through all possible $8^3 = 512$ quadratic forms. For each form, I'll check if it has already been assigned to an equivalence class.\n4.  **Orbit Computation**: If a form is new, it represents a new equivalence class. I will then compute its entire orbit (the set of all equivalent forms) by applying every transformation in $GL_2(\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z})$. All forms in this orbit are marked as \"visited\".\n5.  **Classification by Invariant**: An invariant for this equivalence relation is the determinant of the associated bilinear form's matrix, $D = 4ac - b^2 \\pmod 8$. I will count the number of classes for each possible value of this invariant.\n6.  **Output the Result**: Finally, the code will print the number of classes for each determinant value and the total sum, presenting it as an equation.\n\nThis method systematically explores the entire space of quadratic forms and partitions it into disjoint equivalence classes, ensuring an accurate count.\n\n```python\nimport math\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef count_quadratic_form_classes():\n    \"\"\"\n    Counts the number of equivalence classes of quadratic forms in two variables\n    over the ring Z/8Z.\n    \"\"\"\n    N = 8\n\n    # Step 1: Generate the group GL(2, Z/8Z)\n    gl2n = []\n    units = {i for i in range(N) if math.gcd(i, N) == 1}\n    for p in range(N):\n        for q in range(N):\n            for r in range(N):\n                for s in range(N):\n                    det = (p * s - q * r) % N\n                    if det in units:\n                        gl2n.append(((p, q), (r, s)))\n\n    # Step 2: Use a set to keep track of visited forms\n    visited_forms = set()\n    \n    # Step 3: Use a dictionary to store counts for each determinant value\n    class_counts_by_det = defaultdict(int)\n\n    # Step 4: Iterate through all possible forms\n    for a_start in range(N):\n        for b_start in range(N):\n            for c_start in range(N):\n                start_form = (a_start, b_start, c_start)\n                \n                if start_form in visited_forms:\n                    continue\n\n                # Found a new equivalence class\n                # Calculate the determinant invariant D = 4ac - b^2 (mod N)\n                det_invariant = (4 * a_start * c_start - b_start**2) % N\n                class_counts_by_det[det_invariant] += 1\n                \n                # Compute the orbit of the new form\n                orbit = set()\n                queue = [start_form]\n                orbit.add(start_form)\n                \n                head = 0\n                while head < len(queue):\n                    a, b, c = queue[head]\n                    head += 1\n                    \n                    for T in gl2n:\n                        p, q = T[0]\n                        r, s = T[1]\n                        \n                        # Apply the transformation T to the form (a, b, c)\n                        # Q'(x,y) = Q(px+qy, rx+sy)\n                        # a' = a*p^2 + b*p*r + c*r^2\n                        # b' = 2*a*p*q + b*(p*s+q*r) + 2*c*r*s\n                        # c' = a*q^2 + b*q*s + c*s^2\n                        \n                        a_new = (a * p**2 + b * p * r + c * r**2) % N\n                        b_new = (2 * a * p * q + b * (p * s + q * r) + 2 * c * r * s) % N\n                        c_new = (a * q**2 + b * q * s + c * s**2) % N\n                        \n                        new_form = (a_new, b_new, c_new)\n                        \n                        if new_form not in orbit:\n                            orbit.add(new_form)\n                            queue.append(new_form)\n                \n                visited_forms.update(orbit)\n\n    # Step 5: Print the results\n    total_classes = 0\n    sorted_dets = sorted(class_counts_by_det.keys())\n    \n    print(\"Number of equivalence classes for each determinant invariant:\")\n    \n    equation_parts = []\n    for d in sorted_dets:\n        count = class_counts_by_det[d]\n        print(f\"D = {d}: {count} classes\")\n        total_classes += count\n        equation_parts.append(str(count))\n        \n    equation_str = \" + \".join(equation_parts)\n    print(\"\\nTotal number of equivalence classes:\")\n    print(f\"{equation_str} = {total_classes}\")\n\n\ncount_quadratic_form_classes()\n```\n<<<20>>>"
