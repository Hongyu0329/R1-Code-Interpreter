    "Of course, I can help with that. The question is about identifying a specific novel and its author based on a quote and a description by Jorge Luis Borges. I will use a Python script to present the answer clearly.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Identify the novel and author from the provided quote and description.\n2.  Store the novel's title, the author's name, and the context in Python variables.\n3.  Use the `print()` function to display the information in a complete, easy-to-read sentence.\n\n```python\ndef find_borges_reference():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the novel and author\n    Borges referred to with the given quote and description.\n    \"\"\"\n    novel_title = \"The Invention of Morel (La invenci√≥n de Morel)\"\n    author_name = \"Adolfo Bioy Casares\"\n    source_of_quote = \"Borges's prologue to the novel\"\n\n    print(f\"The novel Jorge Luis Borges refers to is '{novel_title}' by {author_name}.\")\n    print(f\"The quote comes from {source_of_quote}.\")\n    print(f\"In that same prologue, Borges describes the author, {author_name}, as a continuator (and simplifier) of Faulkner.\")\n\n# Execute the function to provide the answer\nfind_borges_reference()\n```\n<<<The Invention of Morel>>>"
