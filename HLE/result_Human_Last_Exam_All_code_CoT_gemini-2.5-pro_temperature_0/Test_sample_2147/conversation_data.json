    "Pavel Milyukov, a prominent Russian historian and liberal politician, was a traditionalist in his artistic tastes. He was highly critical of the avant-garde art movements that flourished in the early 20th century. He used the phrase \"stagnant swamp\" to describe what he saw as the decay and incomprehensibility of these new artistic trends. The term \"X-Ys\" in your question is a placeholder for the collective name he and others used for these movements.\n\nMy plan is to write a Python script that will:\n1.  Store the name of the historical figure in a variable.\n2.  Store the term he famously denounced in another variable.\n3.  Print a clear sentence that answers the question using these variables.\n\n```python\ndef solve_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script identifies the term Pavel Milyukov used to denounce\n    certain aspects of Western culture.\n    \"\"\"\n    historical_figure = \"Pavel Milyukov\"\n    denounced_term = \"isms\"\n    metaphor = \"stagnant swamp\"\n\n    # The term \"isms\" refers to the various modern art movements of the time,\n    # such as Cubism, Futurism, Suprematism, etc.\n    \n    print(f\"{historical_figure} denounced the modern art movements, collectively referred to as '{denounced_term}', as a '{metaphor}'.\")\n    print(f\"Therefore, X-Y is: {denounced_term}\")\n\nsolve_riddle()\n```\n<<<isms>>>"
