# The problem asks for the value of the sum Sum = sum_{(n, m) in S} 1/(4^n).
# As derived in the explanation, for each integer n >= 1, there are exactly
# two pairs in the set S, which are (n, 0) and (n, C_n), where C_n is the
# size of the set S_p for a given n.

# The sum can be calculated as follows:
# Sum = sum_{n=1 to infinity} (1/4^n + 1/4^n)
# Sum = 2 * sum_{n=1 to infinity} (1/4)^n

# This is a geometric series with first term a = 1/4 and ratio r = 1/4.
# The sum of an infinite geometric series starting from n=1 is a / (1 - r).
# sum_{n=1 to infinity} (1/4)^n = (1/4) / (1 - 1/4) = (1/4) / (3/4) = 1/3.

# Therefore, the total sum is 2 * (1/3) = 2/3.

# The final equation is Sum = 2 / 3.
# The numbers in this equation are the numerator and the denominator.
numerator = 2
denominator = 3
