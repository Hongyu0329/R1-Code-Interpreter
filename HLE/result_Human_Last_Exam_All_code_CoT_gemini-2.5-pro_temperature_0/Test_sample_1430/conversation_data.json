    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is the plan to solve this algebraic geometry problem, followed by the Python code that explains the steps and provides the final answer.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the core relationship:** The problem asks for the rank of the Néron-Severi group of $X = C^{(15)}$, the 15th symmetric power of a genus 3 curve $C$. The key is to relate this rank, denoted $\\rho(X)$, to the properties of the curve's Jacobian variety, $J(C)$. The fundamental formula is:\n    $\\rho(C^{(d)}) = 1 + \\rho(J(C))$\n    where $\\rho(J(C))$ is the rank of the Néron-Severi group of the Jacobian.\n\n2.  **Find the minimum rank for the Jacobian:** The rank $\\rho(J(C))$ depends on the algebraic structure of the endomorphism ring of $J(C)$. For a generic curve $C$ of genus $g=3$, the Jacobian $J(C)$ has the minimal possible number of endomorphisms (only multiplication by integers). In this case, the rank of its Néron-Severi group is minimal.\n    $\\rho_{min}(J(C)) = 1$.\n\n3.  **Find the maximum rank for the Jacobian:** The rank $\\rho(J(C))$ is bounded by the Hodge number $h^{1,1}(J(C))$. For an abelian variety of dimension $g$, $h^{1,1} = g^2$. Here, $g=3$, so the maximum possible rank is $3^2 = 9$. This maximum is achieved for very special curves, such as the Fermat quartic curve ($x^4 + y^4 = 1$), whose Jacobian has the largest possible amount of symmetry (maximal complex multiplication).\n    $\\rho_{max}(J(C)) = 9$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the final results:** Using the formula from step 1, we can now compute the smallest and largest possible ranks for $X = C^{(15)}$ by substituting the minimum and maximum values for $\\rho(J(C))$.\n\nHere is the Python code that carries out this plan.\n\n```python\ndef solve_neron_severi_rank():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the smallest and largest possible rank of the Neron-Severi group\n    of the 15th symmetric power of a genus 3 Riemann surface.\n    \"\"\"\n    g = 3  # Genus of the curve C\n    d = 15 # Degree of the symmetric power X = C^(d)\n\n    print(f\"Let C be a Riemann surface of genus g = {g}.\")\n    print(f\"Let X be its {d}th symmetric power, X = C^({d}).\")\n    print(\"We want to find the smallest and largest possible rank of the Neron-Severi group of X, denoted rho(X).\\n\")\n\n    # Step 1: State the key formula\n    print(\"Step 1: The rank of the Neron-Severi group of a symmetric power of a curve is related to the rank of the Neron-Severi group of its Jacobian, J(C).\")\n    print(\"The formula is: rho(C^(d)) = 1 + rho(J(C)).\")\n    print(\"So, the problem reduces to finding the minimum and maximum possible values for rho(J(C)) for a genus 3 curve.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Find the minimum rank of NS(J(C))\n    print(\"Step 2: Finding the smallest possible rank, rho_min(J(C)).\")\n    print(\"This occurs for a generic curve C, whose Jacobian J(C) has the minimal endomorphism ring (the integers).\")\n    rho_jc_min = 1\n    print(f\"For a generic genus {g} curve, rho(J(C)) = {rho_jc_min}.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 3: Find the maximum rank of NS(J(C))\n    print(\"Step 3: Finding the largest possible rank, rho_max(J(C)).\")\n    print(f\"The rank rho(J(C)) is bounded by the Hodge number h^(1,1)(J(C)), which is g*g.\")\n    h11_jc = g * g\n    print(f\"For g = {g}, the maximum theoretical rank is {g}*{g} = {h11_jc}.\")\n    print(\"This maximum is achieved for special curves with maximal complex multiplication (e.g., the Fermat quartic curve).\")\n    rho_jc_max = h11_jc\n    print(f\"Thus, the maximum possible rank is rho_max(J(C)) = {rho_jc_max}.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 4: Calculate the final results for X\n    print(\"Step 4: Calculate the smallest and largest ranks for X = C^(15).\\n\")\n\n    # Smallest rank\n    print(\"The smallest possible rank of NS(X) is:\")\n    smallest_rank = 1 + rho_jc_min\n    print(f\"rho_min(X) = 1 + rho_min(J(C)) = 1 + {rho_jc_min} = {smallest_rank}\")\n\n    # Largest rank\n    print(\"\\nThe largest possible rank of NS(X) is:\")\n    largest_rank = 1 + rho_jc_max\n    print(f\"rho_max(X) = 1 + rho_max(J(C)) = 1 + {rho_jc_max} = {largest_rank}\")\n\n    # Final answer in the required format\n    # The problem asks for two numbers, the smallest and the largest rank.\n    # We will provide them as a tuple.\n    final_answer = (smallest_rank, largest_rank)\n    return final_answer\n\n# Execute the function and print the final answer\nfinal_ranks = solve_neron_severi_rank()\nprint(f\"\\n<<<The smallest possible rank is {final_ranks[0]} and the largest is {final_ranks[1]}.>>>\")\n\n```"
