    "This problem involves determining the number of combinatorial types of stable reductions for a genus 4 curve whose Jacobian has good reduction. This is a problem in algebraic geometry that can be translated into a combinatorial graph theory problem.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Translate the geometric problem into a combinatorial one:**\n    *   A fundamental result by Raynaud states that if the Jacobian of a curve `C` has good reduction, the dual graph of its stable reduction `C_s` must be a tree.\n    *   The arithmetic genus of the stable reduction `C_s` is the sum of the geometric genera of its irreducible components, because the dual graph is a tree.\n    *   The components of `C_s` can only be elliptic curves (genus 1) or rational curves (genus 0).\n    *   Given that the total genus is 4, the sum of the genera of the components must be 4. This implies there must be exactly 4 components of genus 1 and any number (`n_0 >= 0`) of components of genus 0.\n    *   The stability condition for a component `C_i` with genus `g_i` and `k_i` nodes (where `k_i` is the degree of the corresponding vertex in the dual graph) is `2*g_i - 2 + k_i > 0`.\n        *   For a genus 1 component: `2*1 - 2 + k_i > 0` => `k_i > 0`, so its vertex must have degree at least 1.\n        *   For a genus 0 component: `2*0 - 2 + k_i > 0` => `k_i > 2`, so its vertex must have degree at least 3.\n\n2.  **Solve the combinatorial problem:**\n    *   We need to count the number of non-isomorphic trees with two types of vertices:\n        *   4 \"genus 1\" vertices, each with degree at least 1.\n        *   `n_0` \"genus 0\" vertices, each with degree at least 3.\n    *   We will analyze this by considering the number of genus 0 vertices (`n_0`) case by case.\n\n3.  **Implement in Python:**\n    *   The Python script will systematically go through the cases for `n_0`, explain the reasoning for each case, and sum the results to find the total number of types.\n\n```python\ndef solve_stable_reductions():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of types of stable reductions of genus 4 curves\n    with good reduction Jacobians by solving a combinatorial graph problem.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"This problem is equivalent to counting the number of certain types of trees.\")\n    print(\"The conditions for these trees are:\")\n    print(\"1.
