# This script calculates and prints the output of the provided Scheme code.
# The Scheme code uses continuations to create a complex control flow.
# By tracing the execution as described in the plan, we can determine the exact sequence of numbers printed.
# The final output sequence is 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 4.
# This script simply prints that sequence.

output_sequence = [1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 4]

# The prompt asks to output each number in the final result.
# We will print them separated by spaces.
