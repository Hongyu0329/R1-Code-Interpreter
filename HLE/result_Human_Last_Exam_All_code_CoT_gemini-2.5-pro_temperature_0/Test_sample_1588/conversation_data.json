    "To solve this problem, I will use Witt's formula, which calculates the number of basic Lie polynomials of a certain degree. The number of nonzero coefficients of order `n` in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) expansion for two non-commuting variables (X and Y) is precisely this value.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  **Identify the Formula**: The number of linearly independent Lie polynomials of degree `n` in `k` generators, denoted `L_k(n)`, is given by Witt's formula:\n    `L_k(n) = (1/n) * Σ_{d|n} [μ(d) * k^(n/d)]`\n    where the sum is over all positive divisors `d` of `n`, and `μ(d)` is the Möbius function.\n\n2.  **Set the Parameters**: For this specific problem:\n    *   The order `n` is 10.\n    *   The number of generators `k` is 2 (since the expansion is in terms of X and Y).\n\n3.  **Implement the Calculation in Python**:\n    *   I will write a helper function to find all divisors of `n=10`.\n    *   I will write a helper function to compute the Möbius function `μ(d)` for each divisor `d`.\n    *   The main part of the script will iterate through the divisors of 10, calculate each term `μ(d) * 2^(10/d)` in the sum, and add them up.\n    *   Finally, I will divide the total sum by `n=10` to get the result.\n\n4.  **Format the Output**: The script will print the entire calculation step-by-step, showing how each part of the formula is computed, leading to the final answer, as requested.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef get_prime_factorization(num):\n    \"\"\"Returns a dictionary of prime factors and their powers.\"\"\"\n    factors = {}\n    d = 2\n    temp = num\n    while d * d <= temp:\n        while temp % d == 0:\n            factors[d] = factors.get(d, 0) + 1\n            temp //= d\n        d += 1\n    if temp > 1:\n        factors[temp] = factors.get(temp, 0) + 1\n    return factors\n\ndef mobius(n):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the Mobius function mu(n).\"\"\"\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    factors = get_prime_factorization(n)\n    for p in factors:\n        if factors[p] > 1:\n            return 0\n    return (-1)**len(factors)\n\ndef get_divisors(n):\n    \"\"\"Returns a sorted list of divisors of n.\"\"\"\n    divs = set()\n    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            divs.add(i)\n            divs.add(n // i)\n    return sorted(list(divs))\n\ndef solve_bch_coefficients():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of nonzero coefficients of a given order in the\n    BCH expansion using Witt's formula and prints the detailed calculation.\n    \"\"\"\n    # For this problem, we need the number of coefficients of order 10.\n    n = 10  # The order\n    k = 2   # The number of generators (X and Y)\n\n    print(f\"The number of nonzero coefficients is given by Witt's formula:\")\n    print(f\"L_k(n) = (1/n) * sum_{{d|n}} (mu(d) * k^(n/d))\")\n    print(f\"For n={n} and k={k}:\\n\")\n\n    divisors = get_divisors(n)\n    total_sum = 0\n    \n    # To store parts of the equation for printing\n    line1_parts = []\n    line2_parts = []\n    line3_parts = []\n\n    for d in divisors:\n        mu_d = mobius(d)\n        power = n // d\n        k_power_val = k**power\n        term = mu_d * k_power_val\n        total_sum += term\n        \n        # Build strings for each step of the equation\n        line1_parts.append(f\"mu({d})*{k}^({n}/{d})\")\n        line2_parts.append(f\"({mu_d})*{k_power_val}\")\n        line3_parts.append(str(term))\n\n    # Format and print the calculation steps\n    line1 = f\"L_{k}({n}) = (1/{n}) * [ \" + \" + \".join(line1_parts) + \" ]\"\n    \n    # Replace \"+ -\" with \"-\" for cleaner output\n    line2_str = \" + \".join(line2_parts).replace(\"+ -\", \"- \")\n    line2 = f\"L_{k}({n}) = (1/{n}) * [ {line2_str} ]\"\n    \n    line3_str = \" + \".join(line3_parts).replace(\"+ -\", \"- \")\n    line3 = f\"L_{k}({n}) = (1/{n}) * [ {line3_str} ]\"\n    \n    line4 = f\"L_{k}({n}) = (1/{n}) * [ {total_sum} ]\"\n    \n    result = total_sum // n\n    line5 = f\"L_{k}({n}) = {result}\"\n\n    print(\"Calculation:\")\n    print(line1)\n    print(line2)\n    print(line3)\n    print(line4)\n    print(line5)\n    \n    print(f\"\\nThe number of nonzero coefficients of order 10 is {result}.\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve_bch_coefficients()\n<<<99>>>\n```"
