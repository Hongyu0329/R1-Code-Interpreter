To make the calculation easier, the sum only contains numbers 1, 2, 3 and 4. Still, that isn't enough for Xenia.

    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\nFirst, I will analyze the request to determine the most memory-efficient C program for the task. This involves choosing an algorithm that minimizes memory usage. I will detail the variables required for this optimal C program and calculate their total memory consumption in bytes, which will be our final answer `m`.\n\nThen, as requested, I will provide a Python script to solve the same problem. The script will read the sum, rearrange the numbers in non-decreasing order, and print the new sum.\n\n### Memory-Efficient C Program Analysis\n\nTo write the most memory-efficient C program, we should avoid storing the entire input string in memory, as it can be up to 1000 characters long. A better approach is to read the input character by character and process it on the fly.\n\nSince the numbers are limited to only '1', '2', '3', and '4', we can use the \"counting sort\" algorithm. We can maintain a counter for each type of number.\n\nHere is the step-by-step logic for the C program:\n1.  Initialize four integer counters to zero, one for each number (1, 2, 3, 4).\n2.  Read the input one character at a time in a loop until the end of the line.\n3.  Inside the loop, if the character is '1', '2', '3', or '4', increment the corresponding counter. Ignore the '+' characters.\n4.  After the loop finishes, we will have the total count for each number.\n5.  Print the numbers in sorted order. First, print all the '1's, then all the '2's, and so on, separated by '+' signs. A flag variable can be used to ensure '+' is only printed between numbers.\n\n### Variable Memory Calculation\n\nLet's calculate the total memory (`m`) required for the variables in this C program, assuming a standard environment where an `int` variable occupies 4 bytes:\n\n*   `int count1;`: To store the count of number 1. (4 bytes)\n*   `int count2;`: To store the count of number 2. (4 bytes)\n*   `int count3;`: To store the count of number 3. (4 bytes)\n*   `int count4;`: To store the count of number 4. (4 bytes)\n*   `int c;`: To store the character read from input using `getchar()`. `getchar()` returns an `int`. (4 bytes)\n*   `int i;`: A loop counter for the printing phase. (4 bytes)\n*   `int first_term;`: A flag to handle the '+' printing logic. (4 bytes)\n\nTotal variables = 7.\nTotal memory `m` = 7 variables * 4 bytes/variable = 28 bytes.\n\nThis approach is highly memory-efficient as its memory usage is constant and does not depend on the length of the input string.\n\n### Python Solution\n\nHere is the Python code to solve the problem.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Reads a sum as a string, sorts the numbers, and prints the new sum.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Read the input string, e.g., \"3+2+1+4\"\n    s = input()\n\n    # The numbers are separated by '+'. We can split the string to get them.\n    # Since '1' < '2' < '3' < '4' lexicographically, we don't need to convert to integers.\n    summands = s.split('+')\n\n    # Sort the list of numbers.\n    summands.sort()\n\n    # Join the sorted list back into a string with '+' as the separator.\n    # The final equation will have each number printed.\n    new_sum = '+'.join(summands)\n\n    # Print the final result.\n    print(new_sum)\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<28>>>"
