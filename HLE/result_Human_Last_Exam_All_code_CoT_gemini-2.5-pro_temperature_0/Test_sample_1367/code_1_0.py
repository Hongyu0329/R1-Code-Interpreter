    # Part (a): Is V(p) simple for all p in Z_{>=1}?
    # The vertex algebra V(p) is known in literature as the triplet W-algebra W(p).
    # It is a known result that W(p) is simple if and only if p = 1.
    # For any integer p >= 2, V(p) contains a non-trivial ideal and is therefore not simple.
    # Since the statement must hold for ALL p, the answer is No.
    answer_a = "No"

    # Part (b): If there exists a non-trivial ideal in V(p), what condition must be met?
    # In the theory of vertex operator algebras, a VOA is simple if and only if the vacuum
    # representation is irreducible. The existence of a proper submodule in the vacuum
    # representation is equivalent to the existence of a "singular vector".
    # A non-trivial ideal in the VOA is precisely the submodule generated by such a singular vector.
    # Therefore, a non-trivial ideal must contain a singular vector.
    answer_b = "must contain a singular vector"

    # Part (c): Does the simplicity of V(p) imply that it is also irreducible as an L_k(sl_2)-module?
    # We evaluate the implication P => Q, where P is "V(p) is simple" and Q is "V(p) is irreducible as an L_k(sl_2)-module".
    # We must check this for all p in Z_{>=1}.
    # Case 1: p >= 2. In this case, V(p) is not simple, so the premise P is False. In logic, if P is False, the implication P => Q is always True.
    # Case 2: p = 1. In this case, V(p) is simple, so the premise P is True. We must check if Q is true.
    # For p=1, V(1) is isomorphic to the simple affine vertex algebra L_k(sl_2) at level k = -2 + 1/1 = -1.
    # A simple vertex algebra is, by definition, irreducible as a module over itself.
    # So, V(1) is irreducible as an L_{-1}(sl_2)-module. The conclusion Q is True.
    # Since the implication holds for all p, the answer is Yes.
    answer_c = "Yes"

    # Print the final combined answer in the specified format.
    print(f"(a) {answer_a}; (b) {answer_b}; (c) {answer_c}")
