The problem is to find the order type of the set of finite strings over the alphabet {a, b, c, d}, ordered lexicographically.

1.  The set of strings, S, under lexicographical order is a well-ordered set. This means every non-empty subset has a least element. Therefore, its order type is an ordinal number.

2.  Let τ be the order type of S. The set S can be partitioned into:
    - The empty string ("").
    - The set of strings starting with 'a' (S_a).
    - The set of strings starting with 'b' (S_b).
    - The set of strings starting with 'c' (S_c).
    - The set of strings starting with 'd' (S_d).

3.  The order type is the ordered sum of the types of these parts. The empty string has type 1. Each subset S_x is order-isomorphic to S itself, so each has type τ. This gives the ordinal equation:
    τ = 1 + τ + τ + τ + τ
    τ = 1 + 4·τ

4.  We need to find the smallest infinite ordinal τ that solves this equation.
    - For any infinite ordinal τ, 1 + τ = τ. The equation becomes τ = 4·τ.
    - The ordinal ω (the type of natural numbers) is not a solution because 4·ω > ω.
    - The smallest infinite ordinal solution to τ = k·τ for any integer k >= 2 is ω^2 (omega squared).
    - Let's check for τ = ω^2:
      4·ω^2 = 4·(ω·ω) = (4·ω)·ω = (sup{4n | n<ω})·ω. This is incorrect.
      4·ω^2 = (ω+ω+ω+ω)·ω = sup{(ω+ω+ω+ω)·n | n<ω} = sup{ω·(4n) | n<ω} = ω·ω = ω^2.
    - So, 4·ω^2 = ω^2 is correct.
    - Since ω^2 is an infinite ordinal, 1 + ω^2 = ω^2.
    - Thus, 1 + 4·ω^2 = 1 + ω^2 = ω^2.
    - The equation τ = 1 + 4·τ holds for τ = ω^2.

The final equation is τ = 1 + 4·τ.
The numbers in this equation are 1 and 4.
