def solve_cardinality_problem():
    """
    This function explains and provides the solution to the question about the maximum cardinality of the set S.

    The problem asks for the maximum possible cardinality of a set S of Diophantine equations.
    These equations have no solutions, but their unsolvability is unprovable in ZFC,
    while being provable in ZFC + psi, where psi is a statement that can be forced to be true.

    1.  The set of all Diophantine equations is countably infinite. This means the cardinality of S
        is at most countably infinite, denoted as aleph_0.
        |S| <= aleph_0

    2.  To show that this maximum is achievable, we can choose a powerful axiom for psi,
        such as a large cardinal axiom. Let psi be the statement "there exists a measurable cardinal".
        This axiom is known to be forceable in the manner described.

    3.  The existence of a measurable cardinal implies the consistency of ZFC (Con(ZFC)),
        the consistency of ZFC + Con(ZFC), and so on.
        Let phi_0 = Con(ZFC), phi_1 = Con(ZFC + phi_0), ..., phi_{n+1} = Con(ZFC + phi_n + ...).
        Each phi_n is a true Pi_1^0 statement (and thus corresponds to an unsolvable Diophantine equation)
        that is unprovable in ZFC but becomes provable in ZFC + psi.

    4.  This constructs a countably infinite number of Diophantine equations that belong to S.
        |S| >= aleph_0

    5.  From |S| <= aleph_0 and |S| >= aleph_0, we conclude that the maximum possible cardinality is aleph_0.
