    "The task is to identify which of the provided ballet schools is known for having female dancers train at the barre predominantly in pointe shoes. This is a knowledge-based question related to the specific training methodologies of world-renowned ballet institutions.\n\nMy plan is to use a Python script to present the information about each school's training style, specifically concerning pointe work. This will serve as the reasoning for the final answer.\n\n1.  I will create a dictionary containing each ballet school and a brief description of its approach to pointe work at the barre.\n2.  The script will then print this information for the user.\n3.  Based on this information, the script will identify and print the correct school. The School of American Ballet, founded by George Balanchine, is famously known for this practice as the Balanchine technique requires a unique type of foot and ankle strength that is developed by doing barre work on pointe.\n4.  Finally, the script will state the correct answer choice.\n\n```python\ndef solve_ballet_school_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the training methodologies of different ballet schools\n    to determine which one is known for extensive pointe work at the barre.\n    \"\"\"\n    schools = {\n        'A. La Scala': 'Primarily follows the Italian (Cecchetti) method, which focuses on building strength in soft shoes before progressing to extensive pointe work.',\n        'B.

The Royal Ballet': 'Employs a hybrid English style. Like most traditional methods, it emphasizes building fundamental technique in soft shoes at the barre.',\n        'D. School of American Ballet': 'This school teaches the Balanchine method. A unique characteristic of this training is the emphasis on speed and articulation, for which dancers frequently do their barre exercises on pointe to build the necessary strength and technique.',\n        'E. Bolshoi': 'Follows the Russian method, similar to Vaganova. The focus is on creating a strong, solid foundation in soft shoes before dancers spend significant time on pointe.'\n    }\n\n    print(\"Analysis of Ballet School Training Methods (re: Pointe Work at the Barre):\")\n    print(\"=\"*70)\n    for school, description in schools.items():\n        print(f\"{school}: {description}\\n\")\n    \n    correct_answer = \"D.
