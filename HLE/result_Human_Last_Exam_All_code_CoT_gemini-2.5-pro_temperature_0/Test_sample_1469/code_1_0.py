def solve_dialect_puzzle():
    """
    This function solves a puzzle based on traditional sheep-counting dialects.

    The puzzle involves decoding the number "tyaan'eboon" from the Cumbrian dialect.
    - "Tyaan" (or Tyan) is the word for 2.
    - "Boon" (a variation of Bumfit) is the word for 15.
    - "Tyaan'eboon" means "two-and-fifteen", or 17.

    The question asks how many the person had. While a Derbyshireman would use
    a different word for it ("Tan-a-bumfit"), the numerical quantity is the same.

    # Values from the Cumbrian dialect
    tyaan = 2
    boon = 15

    # The total is the sum of the two parts
    total = tyaan + boon

    print("The term 'tyaan\'eboon' is from the Cumbrian counting system.")
