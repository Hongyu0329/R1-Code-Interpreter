    # Part (a): Existence and Uniqueness of hat(G)
    # The concept of hat(G) corresponds to the p-localization of G.
    # For any group G, the p-localization, if it exists, is unique up to isomorphism.
    # For the class of solvable groups, which G belongs to, the p-localization is known to exist.
    # Therefore, a unique minimal group hat(G) exists.
    answer_a = "Yes"

    # Part (b): Maximum possible derived length of hat(G)
    # The analysis hinges on a literal interpretation of the given subnormal series:
    # G = G_1 \triangleleft G_2 \triangleleft \dots \triangleleft G_n \triangleleft G_{n+1} = {1}
    # The notation A \triangleleft B means A is a normal subgroup of B.

    # Step 1: Analyze the end of the series.
    # The relation G_n \triangleleft G_{n+1} with G_{n+1} = {1} (the trivial group)
    # means G_n is a normal subgroup of the trivial group.
    # The only subgroup of {1} is {1} itself. So, G_n = {1}.

    # Step 2: Apply backward induction.
    # The relation G_{n-1} \triangleleft G_n, with G_n = {1}, implies G_{n-1} = {1}.
    # Continuing this process, we find that G_i = {1} for all i in {1, ..., n}.

    # Step 3: Determine G.
    # Since G = G_1, our analysis forces G to be the trivial group, G = {1}.

    # Step 4: Determine hat(G).
    # For G = {1}, any p-nonsingular system over G has solutions in G itself
    # (e.g., by setting all variables to the identity element).
    # Thus, the minimal group hat(G) is G itself. So, hat(G) = {1}.

    # Step 5: Calculate the derived length.
    # The derived length of a group H is the smallest k >= 0 such that H^(k) = {1}.
    # For hat(G) = {1}, the 0-th term of the derived series, hat(G)^(0), is {1}.
    # Therefore, the derived length is 0.
    answer_b = 0

    # Since the problem's premises force G to be the trivial group, the derived
    # length of hat(G) is always 0. The maximum possible value is thus 0.
