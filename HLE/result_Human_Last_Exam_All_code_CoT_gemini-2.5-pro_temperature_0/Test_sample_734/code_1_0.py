    """
    This function identifies the theologian who developed specialized terminology
    to describe changes in the laws of nature, applicable to the virgin birth
    and the Fall.

    The theologian is Augustine of Hippo. He developed the concept of
    "rationes seminales" (seminal reasons). He argued that God, at creation,
    embedded latent causal principles or potentialities within the natural world.

    - For the virgin birth: This was not a violation of nature, but the
      activation by God of a unique potential He had placed in creation from
      the beginning.
    - For the Fall: This event could be understood as altering the way these
      seminal reasons unfold, introducing death and decay into the natural order,
      which now operate as "natural laws" but were not part of the original design.
