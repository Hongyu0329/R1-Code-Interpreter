    "My plan is to identify the specific Christian theologian who developed a systematic framework and specialized terms to explain how miracles and historical events like the Fall could alter the \"laws of nature.\" This involves looking for a key figure in early or medieval theology who addressed the relationship between divine action and the natural order. The theologian I'm looking for proposed that miracles are not so much violations of nature as they are the unfolding of deeper, hidden potentials placed in creation by God. I will then provide the name of this theologian in a Python script.\n\n```python\ndef find_theologian():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the theologian who developed specialized terminology\n    to describe changes in the laws of nature, applicable to the virgin birth\n    and the Fall.\n\n    The theologian is Augustine of Hippo. He developed the concept of\n    \"rationes seminales\" (seminal reasons). He argued that God, at creation,\n    embedded latent causal principles or potentialities within the natural world.\n\n    - For the virgin birth: This was not a violation of nature, but the\n      activation by God of a unique potential He had placed in creation from\n      the beginning.\n    - For the Fall: This event could be understood as altering the way these\n      seminal reasons unfold, introducing death and decay into the natural order,\n      which now operate as \"natural laws\" but were not part of the original design.\n    \"\"\"\n    theologian_name = \"Augustine of Hippo\"\n    print(\"The Christian theologian who first developed specialized terminology for changes in the laws of nature is:\")\n    print(theologian_name)\n\nfind_theologian()\n```\n<<<Augustine of Hippo>>>"
