    # Step 1: Analyze the fitness landscape to find the required jump size.
    # Let k be the number of ones, |x|_1.
    # Fitness f(k) = k for k <= 3n/4
    # Fitness f(k) = k - n/4 + 1/2 for k > 3n/4
    # Local optimum is at k_loc = 3n/4, with fitness f(k_loc) = 3n/4.
    # To escape, an offspring with k' ones must have f(k') >= f(k_loc).
    # k' - n/4 + 1/2 >= 3n/4  =>  k' >= n - 1/2.
    # Since k' must be an integer, the only way to improve is to jump to k' = n.
    # The required jump size is d = n - 3n/4 = n/4.

    # Step 2: Analyze the runtime.
    # With a standard mutation operator, a jump of size d=n/4 takes exponential time.
    # The problem asks for an infimum c for a polynomial runtime O(n^c),
    # which implies a non-standard operator is needed.
    # We consider a heavy-tailed mutation operator, which is a standard tool in modern EA theory for such problems.

    # Step 3: Use known theoretical results for heavy-tailed operators on jump functions.
    # The runtime for a jump of size k is known to be O(n * k^(beta-1) * log n),
    # where beta > 1 is a parameter of the mutation operator.
    # Here, the jump size k is n/4.
    # Runtime T = O(n * (n/4)^(beta-1) * log n) = O(n^beta * log n).

    # Step 4: Determine the exponent c.
    # The complexity is O(n^c), where c = beta.
    # The theory requires beta > 1. We can choose beta arbitrarily close to 1.
    # For example, beta = 1 + epsilon for any epsilon > 0.
    # The set of possible values for c is the interval (1, infinity).

    # Step 5: Find the infimum of c.
    # The infimum (greatest lower bound) of the set (1, infinity) is 1.
    c = 1.0

    # The problem asks to round c to three significant digits.
    c_rounded = round(c, 2)

    # The problem asks to output the numbers in the final equation.
    # The final "equation" is the determination of c.
