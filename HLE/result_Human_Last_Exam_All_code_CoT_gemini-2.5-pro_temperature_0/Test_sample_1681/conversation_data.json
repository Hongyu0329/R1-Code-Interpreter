    "In the classical Prisoner's Dilemma, the rational choice for both players is to defect, leading to a suboptimal outcome of (1, 1) for each. This is the Nash Equilibrium. However, when the game is played in a quantum setting, this dilemma can be resolved.\n\nBy placing the two players in a maximally entangled initial state, a new Nash Equilibrium emerges that is Pareto optimal. This means both players can achieve a better outcome without anyone being worse off. We will set up the game with maximal entanglement and assume both players choose the optimal quantum strategy, which we'll call 'Q'. This strategy is different from the classical 'Cooperate' or 'Defect'.\n\nThe following Python code calculates the payoffs for this quantum equilibrium point. It uses the Eisert-Wilkens-Lewenstein protocol for quantum games. The code will:\n1.  Define the payoff values from the matrix.\n2.  Set up the quantum game operators for a maximally entangled state (`J`).\n3.  Define the optimal quantum strategy `Q` for both players.\n4.  Calculate the final state of the game after both players apply their strategy.\n5.  Determine the probabilities of the four classical outcomes (CC, CD, DC, DD).\n6.  Calculate the final expected payoffs for each player, which represents the equilibrium point.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_quantum_prisoners_dilemma():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the equilibrium point for the Quantum Prisoner's Dilemma\n    with maximal entanglement.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Payoff matrix values:\n    # R: Reward (C,C), S: Sucker (C,D), T: Temptation (D,C), P: Punishment (D,D)\n    R, S, T, P = 5, 0, 7, 1\n\n    # --- Quantum Game Setup ---\n\n    # Identity and Pauli-X gates\n    I = np.eye(2, dtype=complex)\n    sigma_x = np.array([[0, 1], [1, 0]], dtype=complex)\n\n    # Entangling operator J for maximal entanglement (gamma = pi/2)\n    gamma = np.pi / 2\n    J = (1/np.sqrt(2)) * (np.kron(I, I) + 1j * np.kron(sigma_x, sigma_x))\n    J_dagger = J.conj().T\n\n    # Initial state is |00>\n    psi_00 = np.array([1, 0, 0, 0], dtype=complex)\n\n    # --- Equilibrium Strategies ---\n\n    # The new equilibrium strategy 'Q' (a specific unitary operator)\n    # Q = i * sigma_z\n    Q = np.array([[1j, 0], [0, -1j]], dtype=complex)\n\n    # Both players adopt the optimal quantum strategy Q\n    U_A = Q\n    U_B = Q\n\n    # The combined strategy operator for both players\n    U_total = np.kron(U_A, U_B)\n\n    # --- Calculation ---\n\n    # 1.
