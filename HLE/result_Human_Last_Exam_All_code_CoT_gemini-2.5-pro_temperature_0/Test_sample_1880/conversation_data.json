    "To compute the order of the Galois group for the polynomial $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Check for Irreducibility**: I will first determine if the polynomial is irreducible over the rational numbers ($\\mathbb{Q}$). I'll use Eisenstein's criterion for this. An irreducible quartic polynomial's Galois group must be a transitive subgroup of $S_4$.\n2.  **Compute the Discriminant ($\\Delta$)**: The discriminant helps narrow down the possible Galois groups. The Galois group is a subgroup of the alternating group $A_4$ if and only if the discriminant is a perfect square of a rational number.\n3.  **Construct the Resolvent Cubic**: The properties of a related cubic polynomial, the resolvent cubic, will further distinguish the possible groups.\n4.  **Analyze the Resolvent Cubic**: I will check if the resolvent cubic is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$ by searching for rational roots.\n5.  **Determine the Group and its Order**: Based on the properties of the discriminant and the reducibility of the resolvent cubic, I will identify the specific Galois group and its order. The key criteria are:\n    *   If $\\Delta$ is not a square and the resolvent is irreducible, the group is $S_4$ (order 24).\n    *   If $\\Delta$ is not a square and the resolvent is reducible (has one rational root), the group is $D_4$ (order 8) or $C_4$ (order 4).\n    *   If $\\Delta$ is a square and the resolvent is irreducible, the group is $A_4$ (order 12).\n    *   If $\\Delta$ is a square and the resolvent is reducible, the group is $V_4$ (order 4).\n\nThe final distinction between $D_4$ and $C_4$ depends on whether the original polynomial $f(x)$ is reducible over the field generated by the rational root of the resolvent. Since our polynomial is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$, if the rational root is a rational number, the group will be $D_4$.\n\nI will now provide the Python code to perform these calculations.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef compute_galois_order():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the order of the Galois group for the polynomial x^4 + 8x + 14.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The polynomial is f(x) = x^4 + qx + r\n    # For f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14, we have q=8, r=14.\n    q = 8\n    r = 14\n\n    print(f\"The polynomial is f(x) = x^4 + {q}x + {r}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 1: Check for irreducibility (manual check)\n    # Using Eisenstein's criterion with prime p=2:\n    # 2 divides the coefficients 8 and 14.\n    # 2 does not divide the leading coefficient 1.\n    # 2^2 = 4 does not divide the constant term 14.\n    # Therefore, the polynomial is irreducible over the rational numbers Q.\n    print(\"Step 1: Check for irreducibility over Q.\")\n    print(\"By Eisenstein's criterion with p=2, the polynomial is irreducible.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 2: Compute the discriminant\n    # For x^4 + qx + r, the discriminant is Delta = -27*q^4 + 256*r^3\n    print(\"Step 2: Compute the discriminant (Delta).\")\n    q_pow_4 = q**4\n    r_pow_3 = r**3\n    term1 = -27 * q_pow_4\n    term2 = 256 * r_pow_3\n    delta = term1 + term2\n    \n    print(f\"Delta = -27 * q^4 + 256 * r^3\")\n    print(f\"Delta = -27 * {q}^4 + 256 * {r}^3\")\n    print(f\"Delta = -27 * {q_pow_4} + 256 * {r_pow_3}\")\n    print(f\"Delta = {term1} + {term2}\")\n    print(f\"Delta = {delta}\")\n\n    # Check if Delta is a perfect square\n    sqrt_delta_int = math.isqrt(delta)\n    is_square = (sqrt_delta_int**2 == delta)\n    \n    print(f\"\\nIs the discriminant a perfect square? {is_square}\")\n    if not is_square:\n        print(\"The Galois group is not a subgroup of A_4.
