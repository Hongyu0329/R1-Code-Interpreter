    explanation = """
The question asks for a fundamental limitation of using bulk melting experiments to study nucleic acid (NA) thermodynamics, a limitation that exists even under ideal conditions.

Let's break down the options:

A. Heat capacity change is assumed to be zero.
B. The NNBP parameters are T-independent.

These two points are related. They are limitations of the simplest version of the Nearest-Neighbor Base-Pair (NNBP) model, but not a fundamental limitation of the bulk experimental method itself. It is possible to use bulk calorimetric data to fit more complex models that account for heat capacity changes.

D. Temperature oscillations in bulk calorimetry are too large to capture T-dependence.
E. Temperature cannot be controlled in calorimetric experiments.

These points relate to experimental error or control. The prompt specifies we should consider "ideal experimental conditions," where temperature control is assumed to be precise. Therefore, these are not the correct answers.

C. Impossibility to capture heterogeneity in bulk experiments.

This is the correct answer. A 'bulk' experiment measures the average signal from a massive population of molecules (e.g., moles of DNA strands). If the population is heterogeneous—meaning it contains molecules in different states (e.g., perfectly matched duplexes, duplexes with mismatches, hairpins, etc.)—the bulk measurement will only report the ensemble average. It cannot distinguish the properties or melting behavior of these distinct subpopulations. This averaging effect masks the underlying complexity and is an inherent limitation of any bulk measurement technique.
