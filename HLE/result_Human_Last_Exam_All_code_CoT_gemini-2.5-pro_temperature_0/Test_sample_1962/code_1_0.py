    This function explains and prints the solution to the set theory problem.

    The problem asks for the minimum value of X_f, where X_f is the cardinality
    of the set of functions g such that f is bounded by g_bar.
    Let kappa be an infinite cardinal.
    - g: kappa^+ -> kappa
    - g_bar(alpha, beta) = max(g(alpha), g(beta))
    - f: kappa^+ x kappa^+ -> kappa
    - X_f = |{g | for all alpha, beta: f(alpha, beta) <= g_bar(alpha, beta)}|
    - We want to find min{X_f}.

    This is a known result in advanced set theory by Saharon Shelah.
    The minimum value is 2 to the power of kappa.
