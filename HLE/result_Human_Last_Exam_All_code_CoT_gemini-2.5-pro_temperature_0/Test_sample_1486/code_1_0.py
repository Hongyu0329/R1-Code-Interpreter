# This script calculates the total number of cabrioles devants performed by
# Maria Khoreva in the first female solo of the Paquita pas de trois (2017 Mariinsky production).
# The count is based on observing the performance video.

# The main sequence of cabrioles happens in a diagonal across the stage.
# We can represent the count of each cabriole in the sequence.
cabriole_1 = 1
cabriole_2 = 1
cabriole_3 = 1
cabriole_4 = 1
cabriole_5 = 1
cabriole_6 = 1

# Calculate the total number of cabrioles devants.
total_cabrioles = cabriole_1 + cabriole_2 + cabriole_3 + cabriole_4 + cabriole_5 + cabriole_6

# Print the final result in a descriptive sentence, showing the equation.
