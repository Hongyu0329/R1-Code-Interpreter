def find_circle_packing_symmetry(n):

    Finds the symmetry group for the optimal packing of n congruent circles in a circle.

    This function uses a pre-compiled dictionary of known results for specific values of n,
    as the general problem is computationally very hard. The data is based on the best-known
    packings from scientific literature and online databases.

    Args:
        n (int): The number of congruent circles.

    Returns:
        str: The symmetry group in Schoenflies notation, or a message if not found.
