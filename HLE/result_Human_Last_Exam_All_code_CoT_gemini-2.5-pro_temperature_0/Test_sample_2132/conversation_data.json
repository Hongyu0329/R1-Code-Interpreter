    "To determine the Böttcher Molecular Complexity of the product of the Favorskii rearrangement of 2-chlorocyclohexanone, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reaction Product:** The Favorskii rearrangement of an α-halo ketone, such as 2-chlorocyclohexanone, in the presence of a base (like sodium hydroxide) results in a ring contraction. The six-membered cyclohexanone ring becomes a five-membered cyclopentane ring with a carboxylic acid group. The product is **cyclopentanecarboxylic acid**.\n\n2.  **Define Böttcher Molecular Complexity (BMC):** This is a topological index calculated from the non-hydrogen molecular graph using the formula:\n    `BMC = N_bonds * (N_atoms^2) / N_paths`\n    where:\n    *   `N_atoms`: The number of non-hydrogen atoms.\n    *   `N_bonds`: The number of bonds between non-hydrogen atoms.\n    *   `N_paths`: The total number of all simple paths between every pair of non-hydrogen atoms in the molecule.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Molecular Graph of the Product:**\n    *   **`N_atoms`**: Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid (C₆H₁₀O₂) has 6 carbon atoms and 2 oxygen atoms. So, `N_atoms` = 8.\n    *   **`N_bonds`**: We count the connections in the non-hydrogen skeleton: 5 bonds in the cyclopentane ring, 1 bond connecting the ring to the carboxyl carbon, and 2 bonds within the carboxyl group (C=O and C-O, treated as distinct edges). So, `N_bonds` = 8.\n    *   **`N_paths`**: This requires counting every possible simple path (a path that doesn't repeat vertices) between all unique pairs of the 8 non-hydrogen atoms. This is a complex combinatorial task.\n\n4.  **Execution Plan:** We will use a Python script with the `networkx` library to accurately model the molecule's graph and compute the total number of paths (`N_paths`). The script will then use the determined values of `N_atoms`, `N_bonds`, and `N_paths` to calculate the final Böttcher Molecular Complexity. The final output will display the full calculation.\n\nNote: The following code requires the `networkx` library. You can install it by running `pip install networkx`.\n\n```python\nimport networkx as nx\nfrom itertools import combinations\n\ndef calculate_bottcher_complexity():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Böttcher Molecular Complexity for the product of the\n    Favorskii rearrangement of 2-chlorocyclohexanone (cyclopentanecarboxylic acid).\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
