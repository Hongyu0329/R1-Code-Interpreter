    "To find the Alon-Tarsi number of the complete bipartite graph $K_{1000,1000}$, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Understand the Alon-Tarsi Number:** The Alon-Tarsi number of a graph $G$, denoted $AT(G)$, is the smallest integer $k$ for which there exists an orientation $D$ of the edges of $G$ such that:\n    a. The number of even Eulerian subgraphs is not equal to the number of odd Eulerian subgraphs. (An Eulerian subgraph is one where every vertex has an even degree).\n    b. The out-degree of every vertex in the orientation $D$ is less than $k$.\n\n2.  **Apply to $K_{1000,1000}$:**\n    *   Let the two partitions of the graph be $A$ and $B$, each with 1000 vertices.\n    *   We can create an orientation $D$ by directing all edges from partition $A$ to partition $B$.\n    *   In this orientation, for any vertex $v \\in A$, its out-degree is 1000 and its in-degree is 0. For any vertex $u \\in B$, its out-degree is 0 and its in-degree is 1000.\n    *   The maximum out-degree in this orientation is $\\max(d^+(v)) = 1000$.\n\n3.  **Check the Eulerian Subgraph Condition:**\n    *   An Eulerian subgraph in this orientation $D$ must have the in-degree equal to the out-degree for every vertex.\n    *   Given our specific orientation, the only way this condition can be met is if the subgraph has no edges at all (the empty graph).\n    *   The empty graph has 0 edges. Since 0 is an even number, the empty graph is an even Eulerian subgraph.\n    *   Therefore, for this orientation $D$, the number of even Eulerian subgraphs is 1, and the number of odd Eulerian subgraphs is 0. Since $1 \\neq 0$, the first condition is satisfied.\n\n4.  **Determine the Alon-Tarsi Number:**\n    *   We need to find the smallest integer $k$ such that the maximum out-degree is less than $k$.\n    *   The maximum out-degree is 1000.\n    *   So, we need to find the smallest integer $k$ such that $1000 < k$.\n    *   This integer is $1001$.\n\nTherefore, the Alon-Tarsi number of $K_{1000,1000}$ is $1000 + 1 = 1001$. The following Python code calculates this value.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_alon_tarsi_number_k_n_n(n):\n  \"\"\"\n  Calculates the Alon-Tarsi number for a complete bipartite graph K_n,n.\n\n  The Alon-Tarsi number for K_n,n is n + 1.\n  \"\"\"\n  result = n + 1\n  # The problem asks to output each number in the final equation.\n  print(f\"The Alon-Tarsi number of K_{n},{n} is calculated as: {n} + 1 = {result}\")\n\n# For the graph K_1000,1000, the value of n is 1000.\nn_val = 1000\ncalculate_alon_tarsi_number_k_n_n(n_val)\n```\n<<<1001>>>"
