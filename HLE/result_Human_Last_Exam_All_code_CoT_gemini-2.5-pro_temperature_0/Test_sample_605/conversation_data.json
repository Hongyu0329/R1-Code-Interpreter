    "To determine the Crawley-Nordström invariant for the given Calabi-Yau link, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the Weights:** The weights of the ambient space are given as $(w_1, w_2, w_3, w_4, w_5) = (22, 29, 49, 50, 75)$.\n2.  **Determine the Degree (d):** For a hypersurface defined by a single polynomial equation to be Calabi-Yau, the degree of the polynomial, $d$, must equal the sum of the weights. This is known as the Calabi-Yau condition. We will calculate the sum of the given weights to find $d$.\n3.  **Calculate the Invariant:** The Crawley-Nordström invariant is defined by the formula $d - \\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i$. We will substitute the values of $d$ and the sum of the weights into this formula.\n\nThe provided polynomial is quasi-homogeneous with degree $d=225$ (as required by the Calabi-Yau condition, since the sum of weights is 225), although there is a likely typo in the second term of the polynomial expression. We can proceed by using the degree dictated by the Calabi-Yau condition.\n\nThe following Python code will execute these steps and print the final equation.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_crawley_nordstrom_invariant():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Crawley-Nordström invariant for a Calabi-Yau link.\n\n    The Crawley-Nordström invariant is defined as d - sum(w_i), where d is the\n    degree of the polynomial and w_i are the weights of the ambient space.\n    For a Calabi-Yau hypersurface, the degree d must equal the sum of the weights.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The weights of the ambient space\n    weights = [22, 29, 49, 50, 75]\n\n    # For a Calabi-Yau hypersurface, the degree d equals the sum of the weights.\n    sum_of_weights = sum(weights)\n    d = sum_of_weights\n\n    # Calculate the Crawley-Nordström invariant\n    invariant = d - sum_of_weights\n\n    # Format the weights as a string for printing the equation\n    weights_str = \" + \".join(map(str, weights))\n\n    # Print the final equation with all the numbers\n    print(f\"The Crawley-Nordström invariant is calculated as d - (w1 + w2 + w3 + w4 + w5).\")\n    print(f\"Given the Calabi-Yau condition, d = sum of weights.\")\n    print(f\"d = {weights_str} = {d}\")\n    print(f\"Final Equation: {d} - ({weights_str}) = {invariant}\")\n\ncalculate_crawley_nordstrom_invariant()\n```\n<<<0>>>"
