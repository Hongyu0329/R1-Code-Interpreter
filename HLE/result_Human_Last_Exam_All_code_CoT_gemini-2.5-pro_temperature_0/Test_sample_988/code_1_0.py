    # Reasoning for the correct choice
    # When Microcystis aeruginosa is exposed to high-temperature stress, it experiences
    # an increase in Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS), leading to oxidative stress.
    # The cell's most immediate and primary defense mechanism against a sudden surge of ROS
    # is the activation of specific enzymes designed to neutralize them.
    # This enzymatic system, including enzymes like Superoxide Dismutase (SOD) and Catalase (CAT),
    # provides a rapid and highly efficient response. While other antioxidants are important,
    # the enzymatic system is considered the initial line of defense.
