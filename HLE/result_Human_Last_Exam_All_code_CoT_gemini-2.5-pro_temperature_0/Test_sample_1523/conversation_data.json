    "Of course, I can help with that. The problem you're asking about is a fundamental concept in the path integral formulation of quantum field theory at finite temperature. Here is a step-by-step plan to arrive at the solution.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Start with the Partition Function:** The central object in finite-temperature field theory is the partition function, $Z$, which is expressed as a functional integral over all possible field configurations. The integrand is weighted by the exponential of the negative Euclidean action, $e^{-S_E}$.\n2.  **Define the Euclidean Action:** For a free, neutral scalar field $\\phi$ with mass $m$, the Euclidean action $S_E$ is the integral of the Euclidean Lagrangian density over imaginary time ($\\tau$ from $0$ to $\\beta=1/T$) and space.\n3.  **Identify the Inner Product:** By performing an integration by parts on the kinetic terms of the action, we can rewrite it into a compact quadratic form, $S_E = \\frac{1}{2}(\\phi, D\\phi)$. This form reveals the operator $D$ and defines the inner product $(\\phi, D\\phi)$ that you're asking about.\n4.  **Transform to Momentum Space:** The expression for the inner product is much simpler and more insightful in momentum space. We will use a Fourier series for the imaginary time dimension (leading to discrete Matsubara frequencies, $\\omega_n$) and a Fourier transform for the spatial dimensions.\n5.  **Derive the Final Expression:** By substituting the Fourier expansion of the field into the definition of the inner product and evaluating the integrals, we will arrive at the final expression in terms of a sum over Matsubara frequencies and an integral over spatial momentum.\n6.  **Generate Python Code:** Finally, I will provide a Python script that symbolically prints this final equation, clearly labeling all its components and the numbers involved as requested.\n\nFollowing this plan, let's derive the expression.\n\nThe Euclidean action is:\n$S_E[\\phi] = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d\\mathbf{x} \\left[ \\frac{1}{2}(\\partial_\\tau \\phi)^2 + \\frac{1}{2}(\\nabla\\phi)^2 + \\frac{1}{2}m^2\\phi^2 \\right]$\n\nAfter integration by parts, this becomes:\n$S_E[\\phi] = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d\\mathbf{x} \\, \\phi \\left( -\\partial_\\tau^2 - \\nabla^2 + m^2 \\right) \\phi$\n\nThis is in the form $\\frac{1}{2}(\\phi, D\\phi)$, where $D = -\\partial_\\tau^2 - \\nabla^2 + m^2$ is the Euclidean Klein-Gordon operator. The inner product is therefore $(\\phi, D\\phi) = 2S_E$.\n\nIn momentum space, using the Fourier expansion of $\\phi$, this inner product evaluates to the final expression that the following Python code will generate.\n\n```python\ndef print_inner_product_equation():\n    \"\"\"\n    Generates and prints the symbolic equation for the inner product (ϕ, D_ϕ)\n    in finite-temperature field theory for a neutral scalar field.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the symbolic components of the equation using unicode for clarity.\n    beta = \"β\"\n    sum_over_n = \"Σ_n\"\n    integral_numerator = \"dᵈk\"\n    integral_denominator = f\"(2π)ᵈ\"\n    integral = f\"∫ {integral_numerator}/{integral_denominator}\"\n    field_amplitude_sq = \"|φ̃(ωₙ, k)|²\"\n    omega_n_sq = \"ωₙ²\"\n    k_sq = \"k²\"\n    m_sq = \"m²\"\n\n    # Define the numbers that appear in the final equation and its components.\n    number_one = 1\n    number_two = 2\n\n    # Assemble the final equation string.\n    # The equation is (1/β) * Σ_n ∫ [d^d k / (2π)^d] * |φ̃(ω_n, k)|² * (ω_n² + k² + m²)\n    propagator_term = f\"({omega_n_sq} + {k_sq} + {m_sq})\"\n    full_equation = f\"({number_one}/{beta}) {sum_over_n} {integral} {field_amplitude_sq} {propagator_term}\"\n\n    print(\"In the functional integral representation for a neutral scalar field, the inner product (ϕ, D_ϕ) expressed in momentum space is:\")\n    print(f\"\\n(ϕ, D_ϕ) = {full_equation}\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Where:\")\n    print(f\"  - β = {number_one}/T is the inverse temperature.\")\n    print(f\"  - ωₙ = {number_two}πn/{beta} are the bosonic Matsubara frequencies (for integer n).\")\n    print(f\"  - k is the d-dimensional spatial momentum vector.\")\n    print(f\"  - m is the mass of the scalar field.\")\n    print(f\"  - φ̃(ωₙ, k) is the Fourier mode of the field ϕ.\")\n\n    print(\"\\nThe numbers present in the final equation are:\")\n    print(f\"  - The number '{number_one}' appears in the coefficient ({number_one}/{beta}).\")\n    print(f\"  - The number '{number_two}' appears as the exponent in the terms ωₙ², k², and m².\")\n    print(f\"  - The number '{number_two}' also appears in the definition of the Matsubara frequency (2πn/β) and in the denominator of the integral measure ((2π)ᵈ).\")\n\n# Execute the function to print the result.\nprint_inner_product_equation()\n```\n<<<$ (\\phi, D_\\phi) = \\frac{1}{\\beta} \\sum_{n} \\int \\frac{d^d\\mathbf{k}}{(2\\pi)^d} |\\tilde{\\phi}(\\omega_n, \\mathbf{k})|^2 (\\omega_n^2 + \\mathbf{k}^2 + m^2) $>>>"
