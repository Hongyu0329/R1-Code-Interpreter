    "Here is a Python script that analyzes the hearing ranges of different animals to determine which one could hear a human muscle twitch.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  First, I'll establish the frequency range of the sound produced by a human muscle twitch.\n2.  Next, I'll define the approximate hearing frequency ranges for each animal listed in the answer choices.\n3.  Then, the script will compare the muscle twitch frequency with each animal's hearing range.\n4.  Finally, based on this comparison, the script will print the conclusion. All the numbers used in the comparison will be explicitly printed.\n\n```python\ndef solve_animal_hearing_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes animal hearing ranges to determine which might hear a human muscle twitch.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the frequency of a human muscle twitch.\n    # The sound produced by muscle contraction is a very low-frequency vibration.\n    muscle_twitch_min_hz = 5\n    muscle_twitch_max_hz = 50\n    print(f\"The sound from a human muscle twitch is in the very low frequency range of {muscle_twitch_min_hz} Hz to {muscle_twitch_max_hz} Hz.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n\n    # Step 2: Define the hearing ranges for the animals.\n    print(\"Let's compare this to the hearing ranges of the animals in the choices:\")\n    \n    # A.
