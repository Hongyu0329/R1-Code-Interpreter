    "This is a well-known problem in mathematics called the \"circle packing in a circle\" problem. For 14 circles, the optimal arrangement and the formula for the radius of the larger circle have been determined. The radius `R` of the circumscribing circle for 14 circles of radius `r` is given by the formula:\n\nR/r = 1 + sqrt(2 + 4/sqrt(3))\n\nSince the radius of the small circles is given as `r = 1`, the formula simplifies to:\n\nR = 1 + sqrt(2 + 4/sqrt(3))\n\nI will now provide a Python script that calculates this value. The script will break down the calculation step-by-step, showing the value of each part of the formula, and then print the final result rounded to 4 significant digits as requested.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_packing_radius():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the radius of a circle that tightly packs fourteen circles of radius one.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The radius of the small circles\n    r = 1.0\n\n    # The formula for the radius R of the large circle for N=14 small circles is:\n    # R/r = 1 + sqrt(2 + 4/sqrt(3))\n    # We will calculate this step by step.\n\n    print(f\"The radius R is found by the equation: R = r * (1 + sqrt(2 + 4 / sqrt(3)))\")\n    print(f\"Given the small circle radius r = {r}\\n\")\n\n    # Step 1: Calculate the value of sqrt(3)\n    val_sqrt3 = math.sqrt(3)\n    print(f\"Step 1: Calculate sqrt(3)\")\n    print(f\"sqrt(3) = {val_sqrt3}\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Calculate the term 4 / sqrt(3)\n    term1 = 4 / val_sqrt3\n    print(f\"Step 2: Calculate the term 4 / sqrt(3)\")\n    print(f\"4 / {val_sqrt3} = {term1}\\n\")\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate the term inside the main square root\n    term2 = 2 + term1\n    print(f\"Step 3: Calculate the term inside the square root: 2 + (the result from Step 2)\")\n    print(f\"2 + {term1} = {term2}\\n\")\n\n    # Step 4: Take the square root of the result from Step 3\n    term3 = math.sqrt(term2)\n    print(f\"Step 4: Take the square root of the result from Step 3\")\n    print(f\"sqrt({term2}) = {term3}\\n\")\n\n    # Step 5: Complete the calculation for R\n    R = r * (1 + term3)\n    print(f\"Step 5: Complete the final calculation for R = r * (1 + result from Step 4)\")\n    print(f\"R = {r} * (1 + {term3}) = {R}\\n\")\n\n    # Round the result to 4 significant digits\n    # We use the .4g format specifier for 4 significant digits\n    rounded_R = f\"{R:.4g}\"\n\n    print(\"---\")\n    print(f\"The final calculated radius is: {R}\")\n    print(f\"The radius of the circle up to 4 significant digits is: {rounded_R}\")\n\ncalculate_packing_radius()\n```\n<<<3.076>>>"
