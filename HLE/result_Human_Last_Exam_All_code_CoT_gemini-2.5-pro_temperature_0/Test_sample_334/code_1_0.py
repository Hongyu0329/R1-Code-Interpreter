def solve_biometric_challenge():
    """
    This function analyzes the provided options and determines the best solution
    for the described biometric security flaws.

    The core problem is that biometrics are unique but not secret, leading to vulnerabilities:
    1. Spoofing/Replay Attacks: Using fakes (photos, recordings).
    2. Coercion/Duress: Forcing a user to authenticate.
    3. Data Exposure/Non-Revocability: Stolen biometric data is permanently compromised.

    The required solution must address all of the following:
    - Prevent spoofing and replay attacks.
    - Prevent authentication from an unwilling (coerced) user.
    - Remain secure even if biometric data is stolen (revocability).
    - Apply to a wide range of biometric types.

    Analysis of Options:
    - Options like Liveness Detection (D), Challenge-Response (F), and AI Anomaly Detection (E) help with spoofing but fail to protect against data exposure or duress.
    - Options like Hashing (J), ZKP (C), Fuzzy Vaults (M), and Blockchain (G) help protect the stored data but do not prevent live spoofing or duress attacks.
    - Context-Aware Authentication (H) helps with duress but not data exposure.
    - Multi-Factor Biometric Authentication (A) fails because combining multiple non-secret factors doesn't solve the core issue of them being non-secret.
    - The FIPS Module (N) describes a hypothetical perfect device with non-existent standards ("Level 5"), making it less credible.

    The best solution is Strong Multi-Factor Authentication (I).
    - It prevents spoofing/replay because an attacker also needs the PIN and/or hardware token.
    - It can handle duress via mechanisms like a duress PIN.
    - It solves the data exposure problem because the system remains secure thanks to the other factors, and the compromised biometric can be revoked.
    - It is an architectural solution that works with any biometric modality.

    Therefore, Strong Multi-Factor Authentication is the most comprehensive and practical solution.

    print("1. Prevents Spoofing: An attacker needs more than just the biometric.")
    print("2. Handles Duress: A duress PIN can be used to signal for help silently.")
    print("3. Resilient to Data Exposure: If the biometric data is stolen, the other factors keep the system secure, and the biometric can be revoked.")
    print("4. Widely Applicable: This architectural approach works with any biometric type.")
