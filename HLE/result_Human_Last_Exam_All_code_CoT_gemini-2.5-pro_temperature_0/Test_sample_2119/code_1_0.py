# The prompt contains historical clues pointing to a specific figure.
# The description of the minister as "seeking to restore order where he saw none"
# is characteristic of Konstantin Pobedonostsev, a powerful conservative
# statesman in late Imperial Russia.
# "Alexei's tragedy" likely refers to a play by author Alexei Tolstoy,
# specifically "Tsar Fyodor Ioannovich," which Pobedonostsev helped keep banned
# because he felt it undermined the authority of the Tsar.
