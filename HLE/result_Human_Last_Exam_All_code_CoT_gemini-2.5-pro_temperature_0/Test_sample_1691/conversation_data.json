    "For the given integral $I(\\epsilon) = \\int_0^{15.00} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9.0 x^{5.0} + 5.0 x^{6.0} + 9.0 x^{8.0}} dx$, we are looking for an approximation in the small $\\epsilon$ regime ($\\epsilon \\to 0^+$).\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the nature of the problem:** The integrand $\\frac{1}{\\epsilon + f(x)}$ with $f(x) = 9x^5 + 5x^6 + 9x^8$ has a potential divergence issue as $\\epsilon \\to 0$ because $f(x) = 0$ at $x=0$. This means the value of the integral for small $\\epsilon$ is dominated by the behavior of the integrand near $x=0$. This is a classic singular perturbation problem.\n\n2.  **Find the asymptotic expansion:** We can find an asymptotic expansion for $I(\\epsilon)$ for small $\\epsilon$. The form of the expansion is determined by the behavior of $f(x)$ near $x=0$.\n    For small $x$, $f(x) \\approx 9x^5$. The dominant balance in the denominator $\\epsilon + f(x)$ occurs when $\\epsilon \\sim 9x^5$, which implies a scaling $x \\sim \\epsilon^{1/5}$. This suggests an expansion in powers of $\\epsilon^{1/5}$. The leading term of the integral will be of the order $\\epsilon^{-4/5}$.\n\n3.  **Formulate the approximation:** A good analytical approximation can be obtained by taking the first two terms of the asymptotic series:\n    $I(\\epsilon) \\approx c_0 \\epsilon^{p_0} + c_1 \\epsilon^{p_1}$\n    where $p_0 = -4/5$ and $p_1 = -3/5$.\n\n4.  **Derive the coefficients:**\n    *   The leading coefficient $c_0$ is found by approximating the integral with its dominant part near $x=0$, extending the integration limit to infinity, and using the approximation $f(x) \\approx 9x^5$.\n        $I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{dx}{\\epsilon + 9x^5} = c_0 \\epsilon^{-4/5}$\n        This gives $c_0 = \\frac{1}{9^{1/5}} \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{du}{1+u^5}$.\n    *   The next coefficient $c_1$ is found by considering the next term in the expansion of $f(x)$, which is $5x^6$. This term acts as a perturbation. A careful analysis using the method of matched asymptotic expansions shows that:\n        $c_1$ is related to the integral of the first-order correction term.\n\n5.  **Calculate the coefficients:** The integrals for the coefficients are standard forms related to the Beta function, specifically $\\int_0^\\infty \\frac{t^{s-1}}{1+t^n} dt = \\frac{\\pi/n}{\\sin(\\pi s/n)}$.\n    *   For $c_0$, we have $n=5, s=1$, giving $\\int_0^\\infty \\frac{du}{1+u^5} = \\frac{\\pi/5}{\\sin(\\pi/5)}$.\n        $c_0 = \\frac{1}{9^{1/5}} \\frac{\\pi/5}{\\sin(\\pi/5)}$\n    *   For $c_1$, the derivation gives $c_1 = -\\frac{2}{9^{7/5}} \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{u}{1+u^5} du$. For this integral, $n=5, s=2$, so $\\int_0^\\infty \\frac{u}{1+u^5} du = \\frac{\\pi/5}{\\sin(2\\pi/5)}$.\n        $c_1 = -\\frac{2}{9^{7/5}} \\frac{\\pi/5}{\\sin(2\\pi/5)}$\n\n6.  **Implement in Python:** Write a Python script to compute these coefficients numerically and print the resulting analytical formula.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_integral_approximation():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function develops and presents an analytical formula that approximates the integral\n    I(eps) = integral from 0 to 15 of 1 / (eps + 9x^5 + 5x^6 + 9x^8) dx\n    for the small epsilon regime.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Explanation of the Method ---\n    explanation = \"\"\"\n### Method Explanation\n\nThe integral $I(\\epsilon) = \\int_0^{15.00} \\\\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9.0 x^{5.0} + 5.0 x^{6.0} + 9.0 x^{8.0}} dx$ is analyzed in the small $\\epsilon$ limit.\n\n1.  **Singular Behavior**: As $\\epsilon \\to 0^+$, the term $\\epsilon$ in the denominator vanishes. The function $f(x) = 9x^5 + 5x^6 + 9x^8$ is zero at $x=0$, causing the integrand to become very large near this point. This means the behavior of the integral is dominated by the region near $x=0$.\n\n2.  **Asymptotic Expansion**: This type of problem can be solved using asymptotic expansions. The leading behavior is determined by the lowest power of $x$ in $f(x)$, which is $9x^5$. The balance between $\\epsilon$ and $9x^5$ suggests a variable scaling $x \\sim \\epsilon^{1/5}$, which leads to an asymptotic series for $I(\\epsilon)$ in powers of $\\epsilon^{1/5}$.\n\n3.  **Approximation Formula**: We approximate the integral with the first two terms of this series, which provides a highly accurate formula for small $\\epsilon$:\n    $I(\\epsilon) \\approx c_0 \\cdot \\epsilon^{p_0} + c_1 \\cdot \\epsilon^{p_1}$\n\n4.  **Coefficient Calculation**: The coefficients $c_0, c_1$ and powers $p_0, p_1$ are derived from the expansion.\n    - The powers are $p_0 = -4/5$ and $p_1 = -3/5$.\n    - The coefficients are calculated from integrals of the form $\\int_0^\\infty \\\\frac{t^{s-1}}{1+t^n} dt = \\\\frac{\\pi/n}{\\sin(\\pi s/n)}$.\n      - $c_0 = \\\\frac{1}{9^{1/5}} \\int_0^\\infty \\\\frac{du}{1+u^5} = \\\\frac{1}{9^{1/5}} \\\\frac{\\pi/5}{\\sin(\\pi/5)}$\n      - $c_1 = -\\\\frac{2}{9^{7/5}} \\int_0^\\infty \\\\frac{u}{1+u^5} du = -\\\\frac{2}{9^{7/5}} \\\\frac{\\pi/5}{\\sin(2\\pi/5)}$\n\nThe code below computes the numerical values for these coefficients.\n\"\"\"\n    print(explanation)\n\n    # --- Numerical Calculation of Coefficients ---\n\n    # Powers\n    p0 = -4.0 / 5.0\n    p1 = -3.0 / 5.0\n\n    # Coefficient c0\n    c0_term1 = 9.0**(-1.0/5.0)\n    c0_term2 = (np.pi / 5.0) / np.sin(np.pi / 5.0)\n    c0 = c0_term1 * c0_term2\n\n    # Coefficient c1\n    c1_term1 = -2.0 / (9.0**(7.0/5.0))\n    c1_term2 = (np.pi / 5.0) / np.sin(2.0 * np.pi / 5.0)\n    c1 = c1_term1 * c1_term2\n\n    # --- Final Answer ---\n    print(\"### Analytical Formula\")\n    print(\"The analytical formula that approximates I(epsilon) for small epsilon is:\")\n    print(f\"I(eps) ≈ {c0:.6f} * eps^({p0}) + {c1:.6f} * eps^({p1})\")\n    print(\"\\nWhere the numbers in the equation are:\")\n    print(f\"First coefficient: {c0}\")\n    print(f\"First power: {p0}\")\n    print(f\"Second coefficient: {c1}\")\n    print(f\"Second power: {p1}\")\n\n\nsolve_integral_approximation()\n<<<I(eps) ≈ 0.688643 * eps^(-0.8) - 0.060956 * eps^(-0.6)>>>\n```"
