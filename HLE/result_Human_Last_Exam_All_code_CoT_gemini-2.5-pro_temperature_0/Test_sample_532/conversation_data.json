    "This is a fascinating question from abstract algebra. Let's break it down.\n\n### Step-by-step Plan\n\n1.  **Define the Concepts**: First, I'll clarify the definitions of a \"product-free set,\" a \"maximal by inclusion product-free set\" (MIPS), and a \"filled group.\" A crucial detail is that a group `G` is filled if the union of its MIPSs is equal to `G \\ {e}`, where `e` is the identity element. The identity element can never be in a product-free set, so it's excluded.\n2.  **State the Mathematical Result**: The classification of finite filled nilpotent groups is a known mathematical theorem. I will state this theorem clearly. The answer is a specific class of groups.\n3.  **Provide Demonstrative Code**: To satisfy the request for code, I will write a Python script that can check if a given finite group is filled. The script will:\n    *   Take a group's structure as input (specifically, its Cayley table or multiplication table).\n    *   Systematically find all product-free sets.\n    *   Identify which of these are maximal (MIPSs).\n    *   Calculate the union of all MIPSs.\n    *   Compare this union to the set of all non-identity elements to determine if the group is filled.\n4.  **Run Examples**: The script will be used to analyze two key examples to illustrate the theorem:\n    *   **The cyclic group C₄**: A nilpotent group of order 4 = 2². As a 2-group, the theorem predicts it **is** filled.\n    *   **The cyclic group C₆**: A nilpotent group of order 6. Since 6 is not a power of 2, the theorem predicts it **is not** filled.\n\nThe code will print its findings for these two cases, thereby demonstrating the theorem in action.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef is_product_free(s, table):\n    \"\"\"Checks if a subset s is product-free given a Cayley table.\"\"\"\n    if not s:\n        return True\n    for e1 in s:\n        for e2 in s:\n            product = table[e1][e2]\n            if product in s:\n                return False\n    return True\n\ndef find_mips_and_check_filled(group_name, order):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds all Maximal by Inclusion Product-Free Sets (MIPS) for the cyclic group C_n\n    and checks if the group is filled.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Generate the Cayley table for the cyclic group C_n (additive mod n)\n    table = [[(i + j) % order for j in range(order)] for i in range(order)]\n    \n    elements = list(range(order))\n    # The identity element is 0.
