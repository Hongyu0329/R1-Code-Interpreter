# The problem is to find the exponent alpha in the best upper bound N^alpha for the measure of the set X.
# |X| is the measure of the set {x in [0, 1] : max_t |sum a_n e^(2*pi*i*(n*x + n^2*t))| > N^(3/8)}

# From our analysis, we derived the relationship:
# |X| * (Threshold)^2 <= Integral_Bound
# where Threshold = N^(3/8) and Integral_Bound is approximately N^(1/4).

# Let's represent the powers of N.
# Threshold^2 = (N^(3/8))^2 = N^(2 * 3/8) = N^(3/4)
exponent_threshold_sq = 2 * (3/8)

# The integral bound is of the order N^(1/4).
exponent_integral_bound = 1/4

# The relationship in terms of exponents is:
# alpha + exponent_threshold_sq <= exponent_integral_bound
# alpha <= exponent_integral_bound - exponent_threshold_sq
alpha = exponent_integral_bound - exponent_threshold_sq
