# Step 1: Define the constants based on the derivation.

# From comparing the calculated denominator with the given form, we get:
# Calculated: (1/(4*sqrt(lambda))) * (2*l*sqrt(lambda) - sin(2*l*sqrt(lambda)))
# Given: (1/(K1*sqrt(lambda))) * (K2*l*sqrt(lambda) + K3*sin(K4*l*sqrt(lambda)))
K1 = 4
K2 = 2
K3 = -1
K4 = 2

# Step 2: Determine the value of K.
# The condition is sqrt(lambda_m) > K. Since lambda_m > 0 for the BVP,
# sqrt(lambda_m) is always positive. The condition is satisfied for any K <= 0.
# The problem is structured like a puzzle, and the most plausible assumption
# is that K is equal to one of the other derived constants.
# The only non-positive constant is K3. So we assume K = K3.
K = K3

# Step 3: Calculate the final product.
product = K * K1 * K2 * K3 * K4

# Step 4: Print the equation with the values.
print("Based on the analysis:")
print(f"K = {K}")
print(f"K1 = {K1}")
print(f"K2 = {K2}")
print(f"K3 = {K3}")
print(f"K4 = {K4}")
print("\nThe final equation is:")
print(f"{K} * {K1} * {K2} * {K3} * {K4} = {product}")

# Final Answer
print("\nThe value of the product is:")
print(product)
