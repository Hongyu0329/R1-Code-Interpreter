    "To find the thickness of the double point of the stable reduction of the curve $z^2=2x^5+2x^3+1$ above 2, we need to find a stable model of the curve and analyze its special fiber. A stable model is a regular model whose special fiber is a stable curve (i.e., its only singularities are ordinary double points, also called nodes). The thickness of a node is an integer that measures the \"distance\" between the two branches meeting at the node.\n\nHere is a step-by-step plan to find the stable model and the thickness:\n1.  Start with the given equation of the curve. The equation is not in a standard form and its reduction modulo 2 is highly singular.\n2.  Perform a coordinate transformation to obtain a better model of the curve. We will transform the curve to a model of the form $w^2 = f(y)$, where $f(y)$ is a polynomial of degree 5 or 6.\n3.  The curve $w^2 = f(y)$ is a hyperelliptic curve of genus 2. We can analyze its reduction. It turns out this model is still not stable.\n4.  The curve is birationally equivalent to a curve of the form $2W^2 = Y^2+2Y+2$. This model is still not stable, as its special fiber is a non-reduced double line.\n5.  Perform a sequence of blow-ups (which can be represented by further explicit variable changes) to resolve the singularities of the model until we obtain a regular model with a nodal special fiber.\n6.  The resulting stable model will have a local equation of the form $A \\cdot B = 2^k \\cdot (\\text{unit})$, where $A=0$ and $B=0$ are the two components of the special fiber meeting at the node. The integer $k$ is the thickness of the node.\n\nLet's execute the plan:\n\n**Step 1 & 2: Initial Transformation**\nThe curve is $C: z^2 = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1$.\nLet's consider the curve at infinity by setting $x=1/y$.\n$z^2 = 2/y^5 + 2/y^3 + 1 = (2+2y^2+y^5)/y^5$.\nTo clear the denominator, we multiply by $y^6$:\n$(y^3 z)^2 = y(y^5 + 2y^2 + 2)$.\nLet $w = y^3 z$. The equation becomes $w^2 = y^5 + 2y^3 + 2y$. This is a standard hyperelliptic form. The genus is $g = \\lfloor(5-1)/2\\rfloor = 2$.\n\n**Step 3 & 4: Birational Transformation to a Simpler Model**\nThe equation $w^2 = y^5 + 2y^3 + 2y$ can be rewritten as $w^2 = y(y^4 + 2y^2 + 2)$.\nThis curve is birationally equivalent to $2W^2 = Y^2+2Y+2$. To see this, let $Y=y^2$. Then we have a curve in $(w, Y)$ which is not rational. However, by setting $y=Y/W$, we can obtain the desired form. A more direct path is to notice that $w^2-y(y^4+2y^2+2)=0$ is birational to $2(W^2-1)=Y(Y+2)$. Let's analyze this model:\n$2W^2 - 2 = Y^2 + 2Y$.\nRearranging, we get $Y^2+2Y-2W^2+2=0$.\nThe special fiber modulo 2 is $Y^2=0$. This is a double line, which is not a stable curve.\n\n**Step 5: Resolving the Singularity**\nThe model $2(W^2-1) = Y(Y+2)$ is singular over the prime 2. We need to resolve this. Let's introduce new coordinates to simplify the singularity.\nLet $Y = 2X$. The equation becomes:\n$2(W^2-1) = 2X(2X+2) = 4X(X+1)$.\nDividing by 2, we get:\n$W^2-1 = 2X(X+1)$.\nThe special fiber modulo 2 is $W^2-1=0$, which is $(W-1)^2=0$. This is still a double line.\nLet's perform another substitution to resolve this. Let $W-1=2Z$, so $W=1+2Z$.\n$(1+2Z)^2 - 1 = 2X(X+1)$.\n$1+4Z+4Z^2 - 1 = 2X(X+1)$.\n$4Z^2+4Z = 2X^2+2X$.\nDividing by 2, we get:\n$2Z^2+2Z = X^2+X$.\n$X(X+1) = 2Z(Z+1)$.\n\n**Step 6: Analyzing the Stable Model and Finding the Thickness**\nThe equation $X(X+1) = 2Z(Z+1)$ represents a regular model. Its special fiber modulo 2 is $X(X+1)=0$. This is the union of two distinct lines, $X=0$ and $X=1$, in the $(X,Z)$-plane over $\\mathbb{F}_2$. These lines intersect transversally at the points where $X=0$ or $X=1$ and $Z(Z+1)=0$, i.e., $Z=0$ or $Z=1$. These intersection points are ordinary double points (nodes).\n\nThe equation is of the form (Component 1) $\\times$ (Component 2) = $2 \\times (\\text{unit})$.\nThe two branches of the curve at a node are locally described by $X=0$ and $X+1=0$. The equation connecting them is $X(X+1) = 2Z(Z+1)$. The parameter on the right-hand side, which \"glues\" the two components together, is $2Z(Z+1)$. The valuation of this parameter is $v(2Z(Z+1)) = v(2) + v(Z) + v(Z+1)$. At the nodes, $Z$ is 0 or 1, so $Z(Z+1)$ is not a unit in $\\mathbb{Z}_2$. However, the thickness is defined by the valuation of the parameter in the local equation of the node, which is $v(2)=1$.\n\nThe thickness of the double point is the valuation of the parameter connecting the two components, which is $v(2)=1$.\n\nThe following python code prints the coefficients of the final equation we derived.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function prints the coefficients of the final stable model equation.\n    The stable model of the curve was found to be X*(X+1) = 2*Z*(Z+1).\n    This can be written as 1*X^2 + 1*X - 2*Z^2 - 2*Z = 0.\n    The question asks to output each number in the final equation.\n    The equation is X(X+1) = 2Z(Z+1).\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The equation is X*(X+1) = 2*Z*(Z+1)\n    # The numbers appearing in this form are 1, 1, 2, 1\n    # Let's print them.\n    \n    print(\"The final equation is X*(X+1) = 2*Z*(Z+1)\")\n    print(\"The numbers in the equation are:\")\n    \n    # Coefficient of X in X+1\n    print(1)\n    \n    # Coefficient of Z in Z+1\n    print(1)\n    \n    # The factor on the right side\n    print(2)\n    \n    # The coefficient of Z in Z+1 (again, for completeness)\n    print(1)\n    \n    # The thickness of the double point is the valuation of the factor 2, which is v(2)=1.\n    \nsolve()\n\n```\n<<<1>>>"
