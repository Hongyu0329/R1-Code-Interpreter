    "To compute the first homology group $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z})$ of the moduli space $X$ of nondegenerate lattices in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ with unit area, we will follow these steps:\n1.  Identify the space $X$ as a quotient of a Lie group by a discrete subgroup.\n2.  Relate the first homology group to the fundamental group of $X$ using the Hurewicz theorem.\n3.  Determine the fundamental group $\\pi_1(X)$ using facts about Lie group quotients.\n4.
