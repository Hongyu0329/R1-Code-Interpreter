    "To find the number of wallpaper groups with a point group of order 2, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Define the Data:** I will create a data structure containing all 17 wallpaper groups and their corresponding point group orders. The order of a point group is the number of symmetry operations (like rotations and reflections) it contains.\n2.  **Filter the Groups:** I will iterate through this data and select only the wallpaper groups whose point group order is exactly 2.\n3.  **Count and Display:** I will count the number of selected groups and display their names. Finally, I will print the total count as a sum to show how the final number was reached.\n\n```python\ndef count_wallpaper_groups_by_point_group_order():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and counts the wallpaper groups\n    whose point group has a specific order.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the 17 wallpaper groups and their point group orders.\n    # The data is stored as a dictionary where the key is the wallpaper group name\n    # and the value is the order of its associated point group.\n    wallpaper_groups_data = {\n        'p1': 1, 'p2': 2, 'pm': 2, 'pg': 2, 'cm': 2, 'p2mm': 4,\n        'p2mg': 4, 'p2gg': 4, 'c2mm': 4, 'p4': 4, 'p4mm': 8,\n        'p4gm': 8, 'p3': 3, 'p3m1': 6, 'p31m': 6, 'p6': 6, 'p6mm': 12\n    }\n\n    target_order = 2\n    \n    # Step 2: Filter the groups to find those with a point group of order 2.\n    found_groups = []\n    for group, order in wallpaper_groups_data.items():\n        if order == target_order:\n            found_groups.append(group)\n            \n    # Step 3: Count and display the results.\n    count = len(found_groups)\n    \n    print(f\"The wallpaper groups with a point group of order {target_order} are: {', '.join(found_groups)}.\")\n    \n    # Create the equation string as requested\n    equation_parts = ['1'] * count\n    equation_str = \" + \".join(equation_parts)\n    \n    print(f\"The total number is {equation_str} = {count}.\")\n\n# Execute the function\ncount_wallpaper_groups_by_point_group_order()\n```\n<<<4>>>"
