    "To prevent the degradation of p-coumaric acid in *Corynebacterium glutamicum*, you should knock out the gene that initiates its catabolic pathway.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  Identify the metabolic pathway responsible for p-coumaric acid degradation in *Corynebacterium glutamicum*.\n2.  The first committed step in this pathway is the activation of p-coumaric acid to its corresponding CoA-thioester, p-coumaroyl-CoA.\n3.  This reaction is catalyzed by the enzyme p-coumarate-CoA ligase.\n4.  By knocking out the gene encoding this enzyme, you prevent p-coumaric acid from entering the degradation pathway, thus allowing it to accumulate.\n5.  In the well-studied strain *Corynebacterium glutamicum* ATCC 13032, this enzyme is encoded by the gene with the locus tag `cg2915`. This gene is part of a larger operon (`cg2915-cg2918`) responsible for p-coumarate degradation. Targeting `cg2915` is a direct and effective strategy.\n\nI will provide a Python script to print this answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_knockout_gene():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies and explains the gene to be knocked out in Corynebacterium glutamicum\n    to prevent p-coumaric acid degradation.\n    \"\"\"\n    gene_name = \"cg2915\"\n    enzyme_name = \"p-coumarate-CoA ligase\"\n    product = \"p-coumaric acid\"\n    organism = \"Corynebacterium glutamicum\"\n\n    print(f\"To prevent the degradation of {product} in {organism}, you should knock out the gene responsible for the first step in its catabolic pathway.\")\n    print(f\"This first step is the conversion of {product} to p-coumaroyl-CoA, a reaction catalyzed by the enzyme {enzyme_name}.\")\n    print(f\"The gene encoding this enzyme in {organism} ATCC 13032 is:\")\n    print(f\"\\nGene to knock out: {gene_name}\\n\")\n    print(\"Knocking out this gene will block the degradation pathway and should lead to the accumulation of your desired product, p-coumaric acid.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    find_knockout_gene()\n```\n<<<cg2915>>>"
