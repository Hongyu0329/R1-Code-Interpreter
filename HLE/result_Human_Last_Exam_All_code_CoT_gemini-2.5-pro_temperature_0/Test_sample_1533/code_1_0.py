# Let a, b, and c be the side lengths of the triangle ABC opposite to vertices A, B, and C.
# The problem asks for the ratio BM/MI.

# The derivation shows that the ratio can be expressed as (BI/MI) + 1.
# The term BI/MI, when expressed in terms of side lengths, simplifies to (a + c - b) / b.

# Define the components of the expression.
term1_numerator = "a + c - b"
term1_denominator = "b"

# Print the equation for the ratio before final simplification.
# This shows each part of the equation, including the number '1'.
