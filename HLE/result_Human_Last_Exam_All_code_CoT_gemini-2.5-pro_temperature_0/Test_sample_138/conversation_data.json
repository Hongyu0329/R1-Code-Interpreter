    "This is a problem from the mathematical theory of quadratic forms and lattices. The number of isomorphism classes of lattices with specific properties (like being positive definite, even, and having a certain dimension and determinant) is a known, but non-trivial, mathematical result.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Acknowledge the nature of the problem:** This is not a simple calculation. The answer comes from deep mathematical results, specifically the classification of integral lattices.\n2.  **Identify the source of the answer:** The primary tools for this classification are the Minkowski-Siegel mass formula and Kneser's neighboring method. The results are tabulated in standard mathematical references. I will rely on the authoritative \"Online Catalogue of Lattices\" by Gabriele Nebe and Neil Sloane, which is an extension of the tables in the book \"Sphere Packings, Lattices and Groups\" by J.H. Conway and N.J.A. Sloane.\n3.  **Formulate a script:** Since the calculation is too complex to perform from scratch in a simple script, the Python code will store and retrieve this known mathematical fact. The script will clearly state the parameters (dimension and determinant) and print the known number of lattices, citing the source of the information.\n4.  **Present the result:** The script will print the final answer in a clear, descriptive sentence and also as a simple equation-like statement, as requested.\n\n```python\ndef solve_lattice_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Provides the number of positive definite even lattices of a specific\n    dimension and determinant based on known mathematical results.\n    \"\"\"\n    dimension = 17\n    determinant = 2\n\n    # The problem of counting lattice classes is a deep mathematical question.\n    # The answer is not derived from a simple formula but is a known result\n    # from the classification of integral lattices, established by mathematicians\n    # using tools like the mass formula.\n    #\n    # This specific result can be found in the Online Catalogue of Lattices\n    # by G.
