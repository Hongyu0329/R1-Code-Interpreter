    "As there is no specific coding task provided, I will create a sample task that demonstrates the requested capabilities. The task will be to calculate the sum of a few numbers and print the full equation as the output.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  Define three variables representing the numbers to be added.\n2.  Calculate the sum of these three numbers.\n3.  Use the `print()` function to display the complete equation, including each of the original numbers and the final sum, to satisfy the requirement of outputting \"each number in the final equation\".\n\n```python\n# Define the numbers for our equation\nnum1 = 15\nnum2 = 25\nnum3 = 50\n\n# Calculate the sum\ntotal = num1 + num2 + num3\n\n# Print the final equation including each number and the result\nprint(f\"{num1} + {num2} + {num3} = {total}\")\n```\n<<<Music, Sound Effects, Speech>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    In film industry, what is the hierarchy of sound importance in dance scenes?
