    "Here is my plan to solve this riddle:\n1.  I will interpret the title, \"The Bays,\" as a pun on \"The Base.\" This suggests the core of the riddle is to find an unknown numerical base.\n2.  I will extract the numerical clues from the haiku:\n    *   \"An August tempest\": August is the 8th month, giving us the number **8**.\n    *   \"Twice fifteen\": This is a simple calculation, 2 * 15, which equals **30**.\n    *   \"A divine one\": This directly gives us the number **1**.\n3.  I will assemble these numbers into a base conversion equation. The phrase \"brings winds of change\" suggests a conversion is happening. The most logical equation is that a number in the unknown base (`x`) is being converted to base 10. The equation is `18` (base `x`) = `30` (base 10). This can be written algebraically as: `1*x + 8 = 30`.\n4.  I will solve this equation to find the value of the base, `x`.\n5.  The final instruction, \"in alphabetical order what is the answer?\", suggests converting the numerical result into its corresponding letter of the alphabet (where A=1, B=2, etc.).\n6.  The Python code will perform these calculations, print out the equation for clarity, and determine the final letter.\n\n```python\nimport string\n\ndef solve_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the haiku riddle by interpreting it as a mathematical equation\n    to find an unknown number base.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1 & 2: Extract numbers from the haiku clues.\n    # \"A divine one yields\"\n    num_from_line3 = 1\n    # \"An August tempest\"\n    num_from_line1 = 8\n    # \"Twice fifteen brings winds of change\"\n    num_from_line2 = 2 * 15\n\n    # Step 3: Formulate the equation.\n    # The riddle implies an equation for a base conversion:\n    # (num_from_line3 * base) + num_from_line1 = num_from_line2\n    # 1 * base + 8 = 30\n    print(f\"The riddle sets up a base conversion equation.
