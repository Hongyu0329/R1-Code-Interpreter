    This function determines the complexity class for the given MIS algorithm on three types of graphs.
    
    The algorithm is the random ranking variant of Luby's algorithm.
    The complexity of this algorithm on bounded-degree graphs is determined by modern results in distributed computing theory.

    1. For a cycle of length n:
       - The maximum degree is Delta = 2, which is a constant.
       - The lower bound for MIS on a cycle is Omega(log* n), and more tightly Omega(log log n) for randomized algorithms.
       - The upper bound for this algorithm on bounded-degree graphs is O(log^2(log n)).
       - This complexity falls into category 6.
       - d1 = 6

    2. For any tree on n vertices of degree at most 100:
       - The maximum degree is Delta <= 100, which is a constant.
       - A tight lower bound for randomized MIS on trees is Omega(log log n).
       - The upper bound is O(log^2(log n)).
       - This complexity falls into category 6.
       - d2 = 6

    3. For any graph on n vertices of degree at most 100:
       - The maximum degree is Delta <= 100, which is a constant.
       - The lower bound for randomized MIS on bounded-degree graphs is Omega(log log n).
       - The upper bound is O(log^2(log n)).
       - This complexity falls into category 6.
