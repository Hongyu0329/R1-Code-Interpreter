    "To solve this problem, I will simulate each of the three Turing Machines and count the number of steps they take before reaching the halt state 'H'.\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  I will write a Python script to perform the simulation.\n2.  The script will have a function, `simulate_turing_machine`, that takes the set of rules for a single machine as input.\n3.  This function will parse the rules into a dictionary for quick lookups, mapping `(state, symbol_read)` to `(new_state, symbol_to_write, direction_to_move)`.\n4.  It will then simulate the machine's execution step-by-step, starting with an empty tape (all zeros), the head at position 0, and the state as 'A'.\n5.  The simulation will continue until the machine's state becomes 'H'. The function will count every step and return the total.\n6.  The main part of the script will run this simulation for all three machines provided in the problem.\n7.  Finally, to satisfy the prompt's requirement to \"output each number in the final equation\", the script will print an equation showing the step counts for all three machines and identifying the maximum value. It will then state which machine corresponds to that maximum.\n\nThis approach will determine not only which machine runs the longest but also the exact number of steps for each, providing a complete answer.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Simulates three 5-state, 2-symbol Turing Machines to find which one\n    halts after the most steps, starting from an empty tape.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    def simulate_turing_machine(rules_string):\n        \"\"\"\n        Simulates a single Turing Machine based on a given rules string.\n        The rules are ordered by state (A-E) and then by symbol read (0, 1).\n        \"\"\"\n        # Parse the rules string into a structured dictionary for easy access.\n        rules = {}\n        rule_list = rules_string.split()\n        states = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E']\n        for i, state_char in enumerate(states):\n            # Rule for reading 0\n            rule0 = rule_list[i * 2]\n            # The rule format is: NewState WriteValue MoveDirection\n            # e.g., 'B1L' -> State B, Write 1, Move Left\n            rules.setdefault(state_char, {})[0] = (rule0[0], int(rule0[1]), rule0[2])\n            \n            # Rule for reading 1\n            rule1 = rule_list[i * 2 + 1]\n            rules.setdefault(state_char, {})[1] = (rule1[0], int(rule1[1]), rule1[2])\n\n        # Initialize the machine's state\n        # A defaultdict(int) is used for the tape, so any unvisited cell is automatically 0.\n        tape = collections.defaultdict(int)\n        position = 0\n        state = 'A'  # Per convention, the start state is 'A'\n        steps = 0\n        \n        # Set a high limit to prevent accidental infinite loops.
