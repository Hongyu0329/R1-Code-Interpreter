    "To answer this question, I will first identify the locations of the two Luxor Obelisks. Then, I will programmatically search through a list of the early Academy Award for Best Picture winners to find the first one set in a location that would feature one of these obelisks. The most likely candidate is the obelisk located in the Place de la Concorde in Paris, a frequently filmed landmark.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Create a data structure containing the early Best Picture winners, their award year, and their primary setting.\n2.  Iterate through this list chronologically.\n3.  The first film found that is set in Paris, France, will be our answer, as it is known to depict the Place de la Concorde.\n4.  Print the name of the film and the year it won the award.\n\n```python\ndef find_first_best_picture_with_luxor_obelisk():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the first Best Picture winner to depict a Luxor Obelisk.\n\n    The two Luxor Obelisks are located in:\n    1.
