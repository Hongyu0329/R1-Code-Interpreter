    "To determine the number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4, we need to consider both irreducible and reducible groups.\n\nA finite Weyl group's structure is defined by its Coxeter-Dynkin diagram, and its rank is the number of nodes in this diagram. Non-isomorphic groups correspond to distinct diagrams.\n\n1.  **Irreducible Groups**: These correspond to connected Coxeter-Dynkin diagrams. We list all such diagrams with 4 nodes.\n    *   A₄\n    *   B₄ (note: the Weyl group for C₄ is isomorphic to B₄)\n    *   D₄\n    *   F₄\n\n2.  **Reducible Groups**: These correspond to disconnected diagrams. The group is a direct product of smaller irreducible Weyl groups, and the total rank is the sum of the ranks of its components. To find all reducible groups of rank 4, we need to find all partitions of the number 4 into smaller integers and count the possible combinations of irreducible groups for each partition.\n\n    *   **Building Blocks**: First, we list the irreducible groups of ranks 1, 2, and 3.\n        *   Rank 1: A₁\n        *   Rank 2: A₂, B₂, G₂\n        *   Rank 3: A₃, B₃\n\n    *   **Partitions of 4**:\n        *   **3 + 1**: A rank-3 group combined with a rank-1 group.\n        *   **2 + 2**: Two rank-2 groups combined.\n        *   **2 + 1 + 1**: One rank-2 group and two rank-1 groups.\n        *   **1 + 1 + 1 + 1**: Four rank-1 groups.\n\nThe following Python code will systematically count the number of groups for each case (both irreducible and reducible) and sum them up to get the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\nfrom itertools import combinations_with_replacement\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\n\n    This is done by classifying and counting both irreducible and reducible groups.\n    - Irreducible groups correspond to connected Dynkin diagrams of rank 4.\n    - Reducible groups are direct products of smaller irreducible groups,\n      corresponding to partitions of the number 4.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Names of irreducible Weyl groups (by rank)\n    # W(B_n) is isomorphic to W(C_n), so we only list B_n.\n    irreducible_groups = {\n        1: ['A1'],\n        2: ['A2', 'B2', 'G2'],\n        3: ['A3', 'B3'],\n        4: ['A4', 'B4', 'D4', 'F4']\n    }\n\n    # Counts of irreducible groups by rank\n    irreducible_counts = {rank: len(groups) for rank, groups in irreducible_groups.items()}\n\n    print(\"Counting non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4:\\n\")\n\n    # 1.
