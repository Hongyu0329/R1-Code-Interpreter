    # Statement A
    print("A. The language contains 'red frogs swim swiftly', and it is not the longest sentence in the language.")

    print("   - However, as determined in Step 2, the language is finite, so there MUST be a longest sentence.")

    print("   => Statement A is FALSE.\n")

    # Statement B
    print("B. RD accepts 'snake big jump well.' but PR does not.")
    print("   - The grammar's terminals are 'snakes' (plural), not 'snake'.")
    print("   - The terminal 'big' is not in the grammar at all.")
    print("   - The sentence is not in the language L, so neither parser would accept it.")
    print("   => Statement B is FALSE.\n")

    # Statement C
    print("C. Both RD and PR accept 'jump or alike frog swiftly.' and do not run inifinitely.")
    print("   - The grammar 'L = S V C '.' EOF' requires sentences to start with a Subject (S).")
    print("   - This sentence starts with a Verb (V), 'jump'.")
    print("   - The sentence structure is invalid, so it is not in the language L.")
    print("   => Statement C is FALSE.\n")

    # Statement D
    print("D. Neither RD nor PR can be implemented because the grammar contains left recursion.")
    print("   - This claim is too strong. The parsers can be implemented.")
    print("   - They would simply fail (by looping infinitely) on inputs that require the left-recursive rule to be attempted.")
    print("   - They would succeed on valid inputs that do not trigger the problematic rule.")
    print("   => Statement D is FALSE.\n")

    print("Step 5: Final Conclusion")
