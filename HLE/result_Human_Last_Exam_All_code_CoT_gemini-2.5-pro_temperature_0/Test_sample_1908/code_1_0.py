# The problem asks for the smallest possible number of complements a topology T can have,
# given that T is a non-trivial, non-discrete topology on a set X of cardinality c.

# A topology S is a complement to T if:
# 1. The union of their open sets, T U S, generates the discrete topology.
# 2. The intersection of their open sets, T \cap S, is the trivial topology {empty_set, X}.

# This is a known problem in the field of general topology. The solution relies on
# established theorems rather than a direct calculation.

# Theorem 1: A non-trivial, non-discrete topology on a set of size at least 2,
# if it has any complements, must have at least two.
# This implies the answer is >= 2.

# Theorem 2: It is possible to construct a topology on a set of cardinality c
# that has exactly two complements. This is done by building a topology whose
# complements correspond to the automorphisms of a specially constructed
# "rigid" mathematical structure (a specific type of linearly ordered set).

# Combining these two results, the smallest possible number of complements is 2.

smallest_possible_number_of_complements = 2

# The final equation is simply that the number is 2.
# We print the number as the answer.
