    "This is a fascinating question that delves into a specific area of topology known as continuum theory. The answer is not what one might initially expect from studying common examples.\n\nHere is my step-by-step thinking process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Terms:** First, I need to understand the precise mathematical objects in the question.\n    *   **Continuum:** A compact, connected Hausdorff space. Think of a closed, bounded, and connected set in Euclidean space, but the definition is more general.\n    *   **Indecomposable Continuum:** A continuum that cannot be broken down into the union of two smaller, proper subcontinua. It's \"indecomposable\" in a very strong sense.\n    *   **Composant:** For a given point `x` in an indecomposable continuum, its composant is the set of all points that can be joined with `x` inside a proper subcontinuum. The set of all composants partitions the entire space.\n    *   **\"Not necessarily metric\":** This is a critical clue. It means we must consider abstract topological spaces, not just those with a standard distance function like the plane or 3D space.\n\n2.  **Analyze the \"Metric\" Case:** In the more familiar world of *metric* continua (like the famous \"pseudo-arc\" or \"solenoid\" examples), a classic theorem states that the number of composants is uncountably infinite. Specifically, it is `c`, the cardinality of the continuum. If the problem were restricted to metric spaces, the answer would be \"uncountably many.\"\n\n3.  **Address the \"Not Necessarily Metric\" Case:** The user's explicit inclusion of non-metric spaces is key. This opens the door to more exotic possibilities. For a long time, it was an open question in topology whether an indecomposable continuum could have a finite number of composants.\n\n4.  **Recall the Definitive Result:** The question was definitively answered by the mathematician H. Cook. In a 1970 paper, he demonstrated how to construct indecomposable continua with a finite number of composants. His work showed that for any integer `n` greater than or equal to 2, there exists an indecomposable continuum with exactly `n` composants.\n\n5.  **Determine the Minimum:** Since Cook's result proves that indecomposable continua can be constructed with 2, 3, 4, ... composants, the smallest possible number is the minimum value in this sequence.\n\n6.  **Formulate the Code:** I will write a Python script that uses `print` statements to walk through this reasoning and present the final answer clearly, as requested.\n\n```python\ndef solve_continuum_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script explains and solves the topological problem regarding the\n    smallest number of composants in an indecomposable continuum.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"Thinking Process to Solve the Problem:\")\n    print(\"=======================================\")\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 1: Defining the key terms from topology.\")\n    print(\" - A 'continuum' is a compact and connected space.\")\n    print(\" - An 'indecomposable continuum' is a continuum that cannot be split into two smaller (proper) subcontinua.\")\n    print(\" - A 'composant' is a specific type of subset.
