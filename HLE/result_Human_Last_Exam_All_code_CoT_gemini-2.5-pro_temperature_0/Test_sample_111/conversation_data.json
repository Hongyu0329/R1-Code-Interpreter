    "My plan is to use historical data to determine Geoffrey Chaucer's location at the time of Blanche of Lancaster's death.\n\n1.  **Establish the date of death:** I will first identify the year Blanche of Lancaster died. This is a key piece of information.\n2.  **Review Chaucer's timeline:** I will then cross-reference this date with known records of Geoffrey Chaucer's life and travels around that time.\n3.  **Synthesize the information:** Based on his service to the English court and the creation of his poem \"The Book of the Duchess\" in her memory, I will deduce his most probable location.\n4.  **Construct the code:** The Python code will present these facts. To satisfy the prompt's requirement to \"output each number in the final equation,\" I will use the year of death as the primary number in my explanation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chaucer_location():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script determines Geoffrey Chaucer's likely location\n    when Blanche of Lancaster died by analyzing historical facts.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Establish the date of Blanche of Lancaster's death.\n    year_of_death = 1368\n    \n    # Step 2: Present the historical context and reasoning.\n    print(f\"Blanche of Lancaster died in the year {year_of_death}.\")\n    print(\"At this time, Geoffrey Chaucer was an esquire in the English royal court of King Edward III.\")\n    print(\"While records show he traveled to the continent for diplomatic missions during that year, his primary duties and residence were in England.\")\n    print(\"Furthermore, shortly after her death, Chaucer wrote the poem 'The Book of the Duchess' in her honor.\")\n    print(\"This poem, written in English for the English court, strongly indicates he was in England to be part of the court's mourning and to compose the work.\")\n    \n    # Step 3: Conclude the most likely location.\n    print(\"\\nBased on his service to the crown and the writing of 'The Book of the Duchess', the most logical conclusion is that Chaucer was in England.\")\n\nsolve_chaucer_location()\n```\n<<<C>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Where was Geoffrey Chaucer when Blanche of Lancaster died?\n\nAnswer Choices:\nA.
