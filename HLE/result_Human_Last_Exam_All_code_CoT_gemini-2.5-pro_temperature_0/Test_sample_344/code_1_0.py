    # Step 1: Use P15 to resolve P1.
    # P15 states everyone outside the room is creative.
    # P1 is of the form "A unless B", where B is "everyone outside the room is not a creative person".
    # Since B is false (from P15), A must be true.
    print("1. From Premise 15, we know everyone outside the room is creative.")

    # Step 2: Use P8 and P7 to establish key facts about people in the room.
    # P8 is a disjunction (A v B). Assuming the first part (A) leads to a contradiction when combined with P7.
    # Therefore, the second part of P8 must be true.

    # Step 3: Use the new facts to make further deductions with P10.

    print("-" * 30)

    # Step 5: Analyze the proposition about being 'tall'.
    # P11: (not quiet and happy) -> (curious or not tall).
    # For people in the room: not quiet is TRUE, curious is FALSE.
    # The rule simplifies to: (happy) -> (not tall).
