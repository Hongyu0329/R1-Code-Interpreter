    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a plan to solve for the common eigenvalues of $J^2$ and $J_z$ for a p-electron.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify Quantum Numbers:** For a p-electron, the orbital angular momentum quantum number is $l=1$, and the spin quantum number is $s=1/2$.\n2.  **Determine Total Angular Momentum (j):** The total angular momentum quantum number, $j$, is obtained by coupling $l$ and $s$. The possible values of $j$ range from $|l-s|$ to $l+s$ in integer steps.\n3.  **State Eigenvalue Formulas:**\n    *   The eigenvalues of the $J^2$ operator are given by $\\hbar^2 j(j+1)$.\n    *   The eigenvalues of the $J_z$ operator are given by $\\hbar m_j$, where $m_j$ can take values from $-j$ to $+j$ in integer steps.\n4.  **Calculate Eigenvalues:** I will write a Python script to perform these calculations for each possible value of $j$. For simplicity, the script will calculate the eigenvalues in units where $\\hbar=1$. The script will print out the state, the calculation, and the resulting pair of eigenvalues for $J^2$ and $J_z$.\n\nHere is the Python code to carry out the plan:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_spin_orbital_coupling():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the common eigenvalues of J^2 and J_z\n    for a p-electron (l=1, s=1/2).\n    Eigenvalues are calculated in units where h_bar = 1.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define quantum numbers for a p-electron\n    l = 1\n    s = 0.5\n\n    print(f\"Solving for a p-electron with orbital quantum number l = {l} and spin s = {s}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    # Step 2: Determine possible total angular momentum quantum numbers (j)\n    j_min = abs(l - s)\n    j_max = l + s\n    # The values of j go from j_min to j_max in steps of 1\n    j_values = np.arange(j_min, j_max + 1, 1)\n\n    print(f\"The possible values for the total angular momentum quantum number j are from |l-s| to l+s.\")\n    print(f\"j can be: {list(j_values)}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n    print(\"The common eigenvalues for J^2 and J_z are found for each state |j, m_j>.\")\n    print(\"Eigenvalue of J^2 = j * (j + 1)\")\n    print(\"Eigenvalue of J_z = m_j\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    # Step 3 & 4: Calculate and print eigenvalues for each j\n    all_eigenvalues = []\n    for j in j_values:\n        # Calculate J^2 eigenvalue\n        j2_eigenvalue = j * (j + 1)\n        \n        print(f\"For the state with j = {j}:\")\n        print(f\"  The eigenvalue of J^2 is {j} * ({j} + 1) = {j2_eigenvalue}\")\n\n        # Determine possible m_j values for the current j\n        mj_values = np.arange(-j, j + 1, 1)\n        \n        print(f\"  The possible m_j values are: {list(mj_values)}\")\n\n        # Print the common eigenvalues for each m_j\n        for mj in mj_values:\n            # The J_z eigenvalue is simply mj\n            jz_eigenvalue = mj\n            print(f\"    For state |j={j}, m_j={mj}>, the (J^2, J_z) eigenvalues are ({j2_eigenvalue}, {jz_eigenvalue})\")\n            all_eigenvalues.append((j2_eigenvalue, jz_eigenvalue))\n        print()\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve_spin_orbital_coupling()\n<<<[(3.75, 1.5), (3.75, 0.5), (3.75, -0.5), (3.75, -1.5), (0.75, 0.5), (0.75, -0.5)]>>>\n```"
