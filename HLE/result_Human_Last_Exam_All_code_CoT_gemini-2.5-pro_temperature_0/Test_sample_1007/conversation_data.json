    "To determine which ballet step ends in the same leg position as it starts, let's analyze each option step-by-step. The \"leg position\" here refers to the specific configuration, including which foot is in front.\n\n1.  **Analyze Entrechat six:** This is a jump starting from fifth position. The dancer's legs beat three times in the air, resulting in six distinct movements. If a dancer starts with the right foot in front, they will land with the left foot in front. Therefore, the ending position is different from the starting one.\n\n2.  **Analyze Échappé battu changé:**\n    *   *Échappé* means to escape, typically from a closed position (like fifth) to an open one (like second).\n    *   *Battu* means beaten, indicating the legs beat together.\n    *   *Changé* means changed. This explicitly states that the feet will change position upon closing. The step starts in fifth, opens to second, and closes back to fifth, but with the opposite foot in front. The ending position is different.\n\n3.  **Analyze Assemblé:** The name means \"to assemble.\" In this step, the working leg brushes out, the dancer jumps off the supporting leg, and both legs are brought together (\"assembled\") in the air to land simultaneously in fifth position. A standard assemblé (e.g., *assemblé de côté*) will land with the same foot in front as it started. For example, if you start in fifth with the right foot back, you brush the right foot out, jump, and land back in fifth with the right foot back. The starting and ending positions are the same.\n\n4.  **Analyze Glissade derrière:** This means \"to glide behind.\" Starting from fifth position, the back foot glides out, and the front foot closes *behind* it into fifth position. This action causes the feet to change, so the foot that was in front is now in the back. The ending position is different.\n\n5.  **Analyze Gargouillade:** This is a complex decorative step, like a *pas de chat* but with a circular movement (*rond de jambe*) of each leg. It typically involves a change of feet upon landing, similar to an entrechat.\n\nBased on this analysis, the Assemblé is the step that, in its fundamental form, concludes in the exact same position from which it began.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_ballet_steps():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes classical ballet steps to find which one ends in the same position it starts.\n    \"\"\"\n    steps = {\n        \"A.

Assemblé\": \"Meaning 'to assemble,' this step involves brushing one leg out, jumping, and bringing both legs together to land in the same fifth position from which the step began. The starting and ending positions are identical.\",\n        \"D. Glissade derrière\": \"Meaning 'glide behind,' this step involves the front foot closing behind the other, which changes which foot is in front. The position changes.\",\n        \"E. Gargouillade\": \"A complex jump that, like an entrechat, typically involves a change of feet upon landing.
