    print("1. The White stones are enclosed by Black stones, forming a single large group that is fighting for 'life'. To survive, the group must create two separate empty spaces called 'eyes'.")
    print("2. Black's goal is to prevent this by playing on the 'vital point' of the White group's potential eye space.")
    print("3. The most critical empty point is (2, 4). This point is central to several White stones and is the key to collapsing their shape.")

    print("\nProposed Move: Black plays at (2, 4).")

    print("\nConsequences of this move:")
    print("1. Black's move at (2, 4) immediately puts the White stone at (2, 5) into 'atari' (a state of having only one liberty). The last liberty for W(2,5) is at (1, 5).")
    print("2. This forces White to respond by playing at (1, 5) to save the stone. If White plays anywhere else, Black captures the stone at (2, 5). This gives Black the initiative (sente).")
    print("3. After White plays at (1, 5), Black's next move is at (3, 2). This creates a decisive situation called 'miai'. White now has two weak groups that are threatened:")
    print("   - The top group around (1, 4) and (2, 5).")
    print("   - The bottom group around (3, 3) and (2, 2).")
    print("4. White can only defend one of these groups at a time. If White defends the bottom group, Black can proceed to attack and capture the top group. Once the top group is captured, the remaining bottom group does not have enough space to form two eyes and will also be captured.")

    print("\nConclusion:")
    print("The move at (2, 4) is the only choice that initiates a forced sequence leading to the capture of all White stones.")
