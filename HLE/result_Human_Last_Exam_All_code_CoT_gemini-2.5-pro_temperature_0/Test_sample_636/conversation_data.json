    "To solve this state feedback control problem, we need to find a gain matrix `F` that places the eigenvalues (poles) of the closed-loop system `A + BF` at the desired locations `-1 + j` and `-1 - j`.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Desired Characteristic Polynomial**: First, we determine the characteristic polynomial that corresponds to the desired eigenvalues. For eigenvalues `p1` and `p2`, the polynomial is `(s - p1)(s - p2) = 0`. For `p = -1 ± j`, this becomes `s² + 2s + 2 = 0`.\n2.  **System Characteristic Polynomial**: Next, we derive the characteristic polynomial of the closed-loop system matrix, `A_cl = A + BF`. Let `F` be a matrix of unknown variables: `F = [[f11, f12], [f21, f22]]`. The characteristic polynomial is `det(sI - (A + BF)) = 0`.\n3.  **Equate Coefficients**: By expanding `det(sI - (A + BF))` and collecting terms of `s`, we get a polynomial whose coefficients are functions of the elements of `F`. We then equate these coefficients with the coefficients of our desired polynomial (`s² + 2s + 2`). This gives us a system of equations.\n4.  **Solve for F**: The resulting system of equations is non-linear and underdetermined (more unknowns than equations), meaning there are infinite solutions for `F`. We can find one of the simplest solutions by setting some elements of `F` to zero (e.g., `f21 = 0` and `f22 = 0`), which simplifies the problem to a solvable 2x2 linear system.\n5.  **Verification**: Finally, we will use the calculated `F` to compute the closed-loop matrix `A + BF` and verify that its eigenvalues are indeed at the desired locations.\n\nThe code below implements this plan, calculates a valid `F`, and verifies the result.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# --- Introduction ---\n# We are given the system matrices A and B.\n# A = [[-1, 1], [1, 0]]\n# B = [[1, 2], [1, 0]]\n# We want to find a feedback gain matrix F such that the eigenvalues of the\n# closed-loop system A + B*F are at -1 + j and -1 - j.\n\n# --- Derivation Summary ---\n# 1. The desired characteristic polynomial for eigenvalues -1 ± j is s^2 + 2s + 2 = 0.\n# 2. The characteristic polynomial of A + B*F is found by calculating det(sI - (A + B*F)).\n#    Let F = [[f11, f12], [f21, f22]].\n#    This yields: s^2 + s*(1 - f11 - f12 - 2*f21) + (-1 - f11 - 2*f12 + 2*f12*f21 - 2*f22 - 2*f11*f22) = 0.\n# 3. Equating the coefficients with the desired polynomial gives two equations:\n#    (I)  f11 + f12 + 2*f21 = -1\n#    (II) -f11 - 2*f12 + 2*f12*f21 - 2*f22 - 2*f11*f22 = 3\n# 4. To find a simple solution, we set f21 = 0 and f22 = 0. The system becomes:\n#    (I)  f11 + f12 = -1\n#    (II) -f11 - 2*f12 = 3\n# 5. Solving this linear system gives f11 = 1 and f12 = -2.\n# 6. Thus, a valid feedback gain matrix is F = [[1, -2], [0, 0]].\n\n# --- Calculation and Verification ---\n\n# Define system matrices\nA = np.array([[-1., 1.],\n              [1., 0.]])\nB = np.array([[1., 2.],\n              [1., 0.]])\n\n# The calculated feedback gain matrix from our derivation\nF = np.array([[1., -2.],\n              [0.,  0.]])\n\n# Calculate the closed-loop system matrix A_cl = A + B*F\nA_cl = A + B @ F\n\n# --- Output ---\n\nprint(\"The final equation A + B*F = A_cl is shown below with the calculated matrices.\")\n\nprint(\"\\nA =\")\nprint(A)\n\nprint(\"\\nB =\")\nprint(B)\n\nprint(\"\\nCalculated F =\")\nprint(F)\n\nprint(\"\\nResulting A + B*F =\")\nprint(A_cl)\n\n# Verification step: Calculate eigenvalues of the resulting closed-loop system\neigenvalues, _ = np.linalg.eig(A_cl)\n\nprint(\"\\n--- Verification ---\")\nprint(\"The eigenvalues of the resulting matrix A + B*F are:\")\n# Use np.round to handle potential floating point inaccuracies\nprint(np.round(eigenvalues, 5))\nprint(\"These match the desired eigenvalues of -1 ± j.\")\n\n```\n<<<[[1.0, -2.0], [0.0, 0.0]]>>>"
