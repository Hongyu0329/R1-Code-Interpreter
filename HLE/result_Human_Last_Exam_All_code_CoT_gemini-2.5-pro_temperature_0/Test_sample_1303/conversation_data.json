    "Here is a plan to find the small molecules that interact with the specified ChEMBL ID:\n\n1.  **Install ChEMBL Client**: First, I need to ensure the `chembl_webresource_client` library is available. This library allows programmatic access to the ChEMBL database.\n2.  **Connect to ChEMBL**: I will use the library to connect to the ChEMBL database.\n3.  **Query for Activities**: I will query the 'activity' endpoint. The query will be filtered by the target ChEMBL ID (`CHEMBL4803817`).\n4.  **Filter for Potent Small Molecules**: To ensure the results are relevant, I will add filters to the query to select only 'Small molecule' types and those with a pChEMBL value of 5 or greater, which indicates a reasonably strong interaction.\n5.  **Extract and Print Molecule IDs**: From the query results, I will extract the ChEMBL ID for each interacting molecule and print them to the console.\n\n```python\n# First, ensure you have the ChEMBL web resource client installed:\n# pip install chembl_webresource_client\n\nfrom chembl_webresource_client.new_client import new_client\n\n# The ChEMBL ID for the target protein\ntarget_chembl_id = 'CHEMBL4803817'\n\ntry:\n    # Get the activity client\n    activity = new_client.activity\n\n    # Search for activities related to the target\n    # We filter for:\n    # - The specific target ChEMBL ID\n    # - Molecules of type 'Small molecule'\n    # - A pChEMBL value >= 5 to find reasonably potent interactions\n    res = activity.filter(\n        target_chembl_id=target_chembl_id,\n        pchembl_value__gte=5,\n        molecule_type='Small molecule'\n    ).only(['molecule_chembl_id', 'pchembl_value'])\n\n    if res:\n        print(f\"Found small molecules interacting with {target_chembl_id} (pChEMBL >= 5):\")\n        # Use a set to store unique molecule IDs\n        unique_molecule_ids = set()\n        for r in res:\n            unique_molecule_ids.add(r['molecule_chembl_id'])\n        \n        # Print each unique molecule ID\n        for molecule_id in sorted(list(unique_molecule_ids)):\n            print(molecule_id)\n        \n        print(f\"\\n<<<Found {len(unique_molecule_ids)} unique small molecules.>>>\")\n\n    else:\n        print(f\"No small molecule interactions with a pChEMBL value >= 5 found for {target_chembl_id}.\")\n        print(\"<<<No interacting small molecules found.>>>\")\n\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n    print(\"Please ensure you have an internet connection and the 'chembl_webresource_client' library is installed ('pip install chembl_webresource_client').\")\n    print(\"<<<Error occurred during execution.>>>\")\n\n```"
