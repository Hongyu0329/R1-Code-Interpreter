    # 1D measure (length) of the intersection of l and a compact set C is at least 1/2.
    # This is known as the "universal chord problem", where the set C must contain a
    # chord of length w = 1/2 in every direction.

    # The solution to this problem was provided by H. G. Eggleston (1963).
    # He proved that the minimal area 'A' of a compact set possessing a universal chord
    # of length 'w' is given by the formula:
    # A = w^2 * (π - √3) / 8
