# Part (a): Analysis
# The question asks to confirm the identity H(U_{n-1, E})(t) = t^(n-1) * d_n(t).
# A known result in algebraic combinatorics states that the Hilbert series of the
# Chow ring of the uniform matroid U_{n-1, n} is actually H(t) = t^(n-1) * d_n(1/t).
# Let's test the proposed identity for n=3. The derangements in S_3 are (2,3,1) and (3,1,2).
# The number of excedances are exc(2,3,1) = 2 and exc(3,1,2) = 1.
# So, the derangement polynomial is d_3(t) = t^2 + t^1.
# The right-hand side of the proposed identity is t^(3-1) * d_3(t) = t^2 * (t^2 + t) = t^4 + t^3.
# The actual Hilbert series is H(t) = t^2 * d_3(1/t) = t^2 * ((1/t)^2 + (1/t)) = 1 + t.
# Since t^4 + t^3 is not equal to 1 + t, the proposed identity is false.
answer_a = "No"

# Part (b): Analysis
# The degree of the derangement polynomial d_n(t) is the maximum number of excedances
# possible in a derangement of n elements. The maximum number of excedances for any
# permutation in S_n is n-1. This maximum is achieved by the unique permutation (2, 3, ..., n, 1).
# This permutation is a derangement for all n >= 2, since sigma(i) = i+1 != i for i<n,
# and sigma(n) = 1 != n.
# Since exactly one derangement has the maximum number of excedances, the
# coefficient of the highest power term t^(n-1) in d_n(t) is 1.
answer_b = "Yes"

# Part (c): Analysis
# The value d_3(1) is obtained by substituting t=1 into the polynomial d_3(t).
# This sum, d_n(1), is equivalent to the total number of derangements of n elements.
# For n=3, we use the polynomial derived in part (a): d_3(t) = t^2 + t^1.
# Evaluating this at t=1 gives the answer.
val_c = 1**2 + 1**1
