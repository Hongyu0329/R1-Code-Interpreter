The most likely reason is a lack of magnetic coupling due to the coil's specific field geometry. Many coils, especially volume coils like birdcage coils, are designed to confine their magnetic field internally, creating a "null" or zero-field region on the outside where the probe is being placed. The probe must be positioned where the coil's magnetic field lines can pass through it, which may require placing it inside the coil or at a specific location and orientation.
