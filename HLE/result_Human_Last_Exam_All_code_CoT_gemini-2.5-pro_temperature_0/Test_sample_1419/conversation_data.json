    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a step-by-step plan to determine the leading order expression for the fixed point coupling in φ⁴ theory.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the Theory and Method:** The problem concerns the `φ⁴` quantum field theory near four dimensions. The tool to find fixed points of the coupling constant is the Renormalization Group (RG).\n2.  **The Beta Function:** The core of the RG analysis is the beta function, `β(u)`, which describes how the dimensionless coupling `u` changes with the energy scale. A fixed point `u*` is a value of the coupling where this change is zero, i.e., `β(u*) = 0`.\n3.  **Beta Function in `d = 4 - ϵ`:** We use dimensional regularization, setting the spacetime dimension `d = 4 - ϵ`, where `ϵ` is a small positive parameter. For the standard dimensionless coupling `u` in `φ⁴` theory, the one-loop beta function is:\n    `β(u) = -ϵu + (3 / (16π²)) u²`\n    The `-ϵu` term comes from the classical scaling of the coupling, and the `u²` term is the one-loop quantum correction.\n4.  **Solve for the Fixed Point:** To find the fixed point `u*`, we set the beta function to zero:\n    `0 = -ϵu* + (3 / (16π²)) (u*)²`\n    This equation has a trivial solution `u* = 0` (the Gaussian fixed point) and a non-trivial one. We solve for the non-trivial solution, known as the Wilson-Fisher fixed point.\n5.  **Derive the Expression:**\n    `ϵu* = (3 / (16π²)) (u*)²`\n    Assuming `u* ≠ 0`, we can divide by `u*`:\n    `ϵ = (3 / (16π²)) u*`\n    Solving for `u*` gives the desired leading-order expression in terms of `ϵ`.\n6.  **Python Code:** I will provide a Python script that prints the final equation, showing its components and its approximate numerical value, as requested.\n\nHere is the Python code to present the result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef find_fixed_point_expression():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates and prints the leading order expression for the\n    Wilson-Fisher fixed point coupling u* in phi^4 theory near 4 dimensions.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The beta function for the dimensionless coupling u in d = 4 - epsilon dimensions is:\n    # beta(u) = -epsilon * u + (3 / (16 * pi^2)) * u^2\n\n    # A fixed point u* is found by setting beta(u*) = 0.
