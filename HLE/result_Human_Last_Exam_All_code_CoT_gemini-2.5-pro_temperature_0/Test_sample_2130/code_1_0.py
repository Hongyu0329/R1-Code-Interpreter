    # Step 1: Define the dimensionless parameter 'x' and pi.

    # Step 2: Express the ratio A^3 / V^2 as a function of x.
    # Based on the geometry of the paraboloid of revolution:
    # V = 2 * pi * a^3 * (x+1)^2
    # A = 4 * pi * a^2 * (x+1) + (8 * pi * a^2 / 3) * ((x+2)**(3/2) - 1)
    # The ratio F = A^3 / V^2 simplifies to (pi/4) * G(x), where G(x) is a function of x.
    
    # We define the core function G(x) whose minimum we need to find.
    # G(x) = ( [4(x+1) + (8/3)*((x+2)**(3/2) - 1)]**3 ) / (x+1)**4

    # Squaring both sides leads to the cubic equation: x^3 - 21*x^2 + 51*x + 73 = 0.
    # We solve this equation to find the critical points.
    critical_points = sympy.solve(dg_dx, x)

    # Step 4: Identify the correct physical solution.
    # The solutions are [-1, 11 - 4*sqrt(3), 11 + 4*sqrt(3)].
    # We discard x=-1 (since x>0) and x=11-4*sqrt(3) (it's an extraneous root).
    # The only valid solution that minimizes the ratio is x = 11 + 4*sqrt(3).

    # Step 5: Substitute x_min back into the full ratio expression F = (pi/4) * g(x)**3.
