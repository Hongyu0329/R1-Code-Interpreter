def count_subgroups_of_index_4_in_grigorchuk_group():
    """
    Calculates the number of subgroups of index 4 in the Grigorchuk group.

    This is based on two key properties of the Grigorchuk group (G):
    1. The abelianization of G is G_ab = G/[G,G] which is isomorphic to (Z/2Z)^3.
    2. A theorem states that all subgroups of index 4 in G are normal.

    Therefore, the problem reduces to finding the number of normal subgroups of index 4.
    These correspond to subgroups of index 4 in the abelianization G_ab.
    A subgroup of index 4 in G_ab = (Z/2Z)^3 (order 8) has order 8/4 = 2.
    The script calculates the number of subgroups of order 2 in (Z/2Z)^3.
