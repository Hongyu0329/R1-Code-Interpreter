    print("B. The strength of genetic drift: In small populations, drift is a powerful force. It can overwhelm weak selective pressures. The removal of a tiny, non-functional DNA fragment provides a very weak selective advantage. Strong drift makes selection inefficient, allowing these fragments to persist by chance. This is the most direct cause.")

    # C. The efficiency of natural selection
    print("C. The efficiency of natural selection: It is the *inefficiency* of selection that allows fragments to persist. This inefficiency is a direct result of strong genetic drift (Option B). Therefore, drift is the more fundamental factor.")

    # D. The presence of gene duplication

    # E. The level of environmental pressure

    print("Conclusion: The strength of genetic drift is the primary factor because it is magnified in the small populations where genomic decay occurs, and it directly counteracts the weak selective pressure that would otherwise remove non-functional DNA.")
