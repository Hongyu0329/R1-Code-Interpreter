  This function provides the solution to the specified problem in arithmetic geometry.
  The problem asks for the asymptotic ratio of two sets of points on a curve,
  which relates to deep results in number theory.

  The ratio of the number of irreducible degree d points lying in the special
  linear system (the g^r_d) to the total number of degree d points is
  determined by the structure of the map associated with the g^r_d.

  The final answer is given by the inverse of the order of the Galois group G.
