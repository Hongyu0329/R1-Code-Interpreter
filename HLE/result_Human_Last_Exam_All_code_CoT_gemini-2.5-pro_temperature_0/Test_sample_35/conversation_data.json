    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a Python script that analyzes the situation to determine the best hand to shove all-in.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  **Define the Scenario:** I'll start by outlining the key factors of the poker hand: your position (UTG+1), your stack size (16 big blinds), and the tournament stage (near the money bubble).\n2.  **Establish an Opponent's Calling Range:** Given the bubble pressure, opponents will only call an all-in from an early position with a very strong, or \"tight,\" range of hands. I will define a typical tight calling range for this situation.\n3.  **Calculate Equity:** I will present the equity for each of the hand choices (QJs, 99, AJo, AKo) against that tight calling range. Equity is the percentage of the pot a hand is likely to win if the all-in is called.\n4.  **Compare and Conclude:** By comparing the equities, I will determine which hand is the most profitable and robust shove in this specific scenario. The final output will show the comparison clearly.\n\n```python\ndef solve_poker_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes a poker scenario to determine the best hand to shove all-in.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Analyzing the optimal shoving hand from UTG+1 with 16bb on the money bubble.\")\n    print(\"--------------------------------------------------------------------------\")\n    \n    # Step 1: Define the scenario\n    position = \"UTG+1 (Early Position)\"\n    stack_size_bb = 16\n    situation = \"Near the money bubble\"\n    \n    print(f\"Scenario: {stack_size_bb}bb stack, {position}, {situation}.\")\n    print(\"This is a classic 'push-or-fold' spot.
