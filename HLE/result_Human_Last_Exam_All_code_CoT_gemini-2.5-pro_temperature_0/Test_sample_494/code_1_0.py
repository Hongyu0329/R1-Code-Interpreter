    # Step 1: What is Ammonia Tunneling?
    print("\n1. The Nature of Ammonia Tunneling:")
    print("- The ammonia molecule (NH3) has a pyramidal shape.")
    print("- The Nitrogen (N) atom can be on one side of the plane formed by the three Hydrogen (H) atoms, or on the other.")
    print("- These two positions are separated by an energy barrier. Quantum mechanically, the N atom can 'tunnel' through this barrier.")
    print("- This tunneling effect splits the ground vibrational state into two distinct energy levels: a lower-energy symmetric state and a higher-energy antisymmetric state.")
    print("- The existence of this energy split *is* the evidence of tunneling. The phenomenon itself is a result of the molecule's physical shape and the masses of its atoms, which define the potential energy surface.")

    # Step 2: The Role of Nuclear Spin and Particle Statistics
    print("\n2. The Role of Nuclear Spin (Pauli Principle):")
    print("- The Pauli exclusion principle dictates the overall symmetry of a molecule's total wavefunction when identical particles are exchanged.")
    print("- Ordinary Hydrogen (Proton): Has nuclear spin 1/2. It is a FERMION. The total wavefunction must be ANTISYMMETRIC upon exchange of any two protons.")
    print("- Exotic Hydrogen: Has nuclear spin 0. It is a BOSON. The total wavefunction must be SYMMETRIC upon exchange of any two exotic hydrogens.")

    # Step 3: Analysis for Exotic Ammonia
    print("\n3. Analysis for Exotic Ammonia (N(H_exotic)3):")
    print("- The potential energy surface, and thus the tunneling phenomenon, is determined by electromagnetic forces and particle masses. It is NOT dependent on nuclear spin. Therefore, the energy levels in exotic ammonia would still be split into a symmetric and an antisymmetric pair.")
    print("- The question then becomes: Does the symmetry rule for bosons prevent one of these states from existing?")
    print("- For the exotic ammonia, the total wavefunction must be symmetric.")
    print("- The nuclear spin part of the wavefunction for three spin-0 particles is inherently SYMMETRIC.")
    print("- Therefore, the product of the remaining parts of the wavefunction (vibrational x rotational) must also be SYMMETRIC.")
    print("- This means: ")
    print("  - The symmetric vibrational state (lower energy) can only combine with symmetric rotational states.")
    print("  - The antisymmetric vibrational state (higher energy) can only combine with antisymmetric rotational states.")

    # Step 4: Conclusion
    print("\n4. Conclusion:")
    print("- Since the ammonia molecule has both symmetric and antisymmetric rotational states available, it is possible for the molecule to exist in states corresponding to BOTH levels of the tunneling doublet.")
    print("- Therefore, the energy splitting due to tunneling would still be present and observable.")
    print("- The main effect of changing the hydrogens from fermions to bosons would be a change in the appearance of the rotational-vibrational spectrum (some spectral lines would be missing compared to ordinary ammonia), but the fundamental phenomenon of tunneling would persist.")
