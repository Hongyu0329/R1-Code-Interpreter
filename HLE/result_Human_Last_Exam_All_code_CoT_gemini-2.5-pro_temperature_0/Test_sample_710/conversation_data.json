    "My plan is to solve this problem by writing a Python script. The problem asks for the smallest number `N` such that any integer `x >= N` can be written as a sum of distinct numbers from the set `S = {2n^2 + 3n + 1 | n >= 1}`. This is equivalent to finding the largest number `g` that cannot be expressed as such a sum. The number `N` will then be `g + 1`.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan for the script:\n1.  **Generate the numbers**: The script will first generate a sequence of numbers of the form `a_n = 2n^2 + 3n + 1`. We need to generate enough terms so that the next term in the sequence is larger than the expected answer `g`.\n2.  **Compute all possible sums**: Using the generated numbers, the script will find all possible sums that can be made using distinct terms. I will use a dictionary to keep track of each sum and the terms that form it. This will be useful later for showing an example representation.\n3.  **Find the largest unreachable number (g)**: The script will then search for the largest integer `g` that is not in the set of reachable sums. To be certain that `g` is truly the largest unreachable number, we must ensure that any terms not used in the calculation are larger than `g`.\n4.  **Determine N**: Once `g` is found, `N` is simply `g + 1`.\n5.  **Output the result**: The script will print the largest unreachable number `g`, the value of `N`, and demonstrate that `N` can be formed by providing its representation as a sum of distinct terms, as requested.\n\nHere is the Python code to execute this plan:\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the smallest number N such that any number >= N can be written\n    as a sum of distinct numbers of the form 2n^2+3n+1.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Step 1: Generate the sequence a_n = 2n^2 + 3n + 1\n    # We generate enough terms to be confident in our result.\n    # If the largest unreachable number g is found, we must ensure that the\n    # next term in the sequence is greater than g.\n    # Let's generate terms for n from 1 to 10.\n    # a_10 = 2(100)+3(10)+1 = 231.
