    Solves the topological problem by reasoning about the connectivity of the defined space X.

    # Step 1: Deconstruct the space X.
    # The space X is composed of a central "spine" and several "limbs".
    # The spine is the line segment S1 = [0,1] x {0} x {0}.
    # The limbs are copies of the set P, placed at x-coordinates c in {0, 1/4, 1/2, 1}.
    # The notation {0, . . . 1/4, 1/2, 1} is interpreted as the discrete set {0, 1/4, 1/2, 1},
    # which means there are 4 limbs.
    # In total, we have 5 distinct pieces to consider: 1 spine and 4 limbs.
    num_limbs = 4
    num_spine = 1
    num_pieces = num_spine + num_limbs
    
    # Step 2: Analyze the connectivity of the pieces and their connections.
    # The spine S1 is a line segment, so it is a single connected piece.
    # The set P is a union of connected line segments that touch each other, so P is connected.
    # Thus, each limb P_c is also a single connected piece.
    #
    # A limb P_c connects to the spine S1 if they share a common point.
    # A point on the spine is of the form (x, 0, 0).
    # A point on a limb P_c is of the form (c, y, z), where (y,z) is in P.
    # An intersection occurs at x=c, y=0, z=0, i.e., at the point (c, 0, 0).
    # This requires the point (y,z)=(0,0) to be in P.
    # The definition of P includes the segment [0,1] x {0}, which contains (0,0).
    # Therefore, each of the 4 limbs connects to the spine at its corresponding x-coordinate.
    # We have 4 such connections, one for each limb.
    num_connections = 4
    
    # Step 3: Determine the number of connected components of X.
    # We can think of the structure of X as a graph where the 5 pieces are vertices
    # and the 4 connections are edges. These edges connect all pieces into a single structure.
    # The number of connected components of this structure is:
    num_components_of_X = num_pieces - num_connections
    
    # Step 4: Relate the connectivity of X to the question.
    # The question asks for the number of components of the "intersection of all
    # compact connected neighborhoods of a = (0,1,0)".
    # In a compact Hausdorff space like X, this set is precisely the connected component
    # of X that contains the point 'a'.
    # Our analysis in Step 3 shows that the entire space X is connected, meaning it has only one
    # connected component (itself).
    # The point 'a' is in X, so its connected component is the entire space X.
    
    # Step 5: Final Answer.
    # The question is equivalent to asking for the number of connected components of X.
    final_answer = num_components_of_X
