# Based on the analysis, the supremum of the angle alpha, M(theta), is
# achieved when the billiard trajectory connects a point x on the unit circle
# to one of the vertices of the side A, which are P=5 and Q=5*exp(i*theta).
#
# By using coordinate geometry and small-angle approximations for theta, we can
# derive the behavior of M(theta) as theta approaches 0.
#
# The derivation shows that for a small theta, M(theta) can be expressed
# by a simple equation involving theta.
#
# The equation for M(theta) for small theta is:
# M(theta) = (3/4) * theta
#
# We are asked to find the limit of M(theta) as theta goes to 0.
# lim_{theta->0} M(theta) = lim_{theta->0} (3 * theta / 4)

# The numbers in the final equation for M(theta) are:
numerator = 3
denominator = 4

# The limit is calculated as follows:
# As theta approaches 0, the expression (3/4) * theta also approaches 0.
