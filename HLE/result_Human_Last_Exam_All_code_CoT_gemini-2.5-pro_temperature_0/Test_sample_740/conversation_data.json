    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n1.  The given integral equation is a Fredholm integral equation of the second kind: `u(x) = f(x) + λ ∫ K(x,y) u(y) dy`, with `f(x) = 1` and the kernel `K(x,y) = (xⁿ - yⁿ) / (x - y)`.\n2.  The kernel can be expanded as a sum `K(x,y) = ∑_{k=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1-k} y^k`. This is a degenerate (or separable) kernel.\n3.  This implies that the solution `u(x)` must be a polynomial of degree at most `n-1`. We can write `u(x) = ∑_{j=0}^{n-1} a_j x^j`.\n4.  Substituting this form into the original equation leads to a system of `n` linear equations for the `n` unknown coefficients `a_0, ..., a_{n-1}`.\n5.  This system can be written in matrix form `M(λ)a = b`, where the matrix `M(λ)` depends on `λ`.\n6.  The equation has no solution if the determinant of the coefficient matrix is zero (`det(M(λ)) = 0`) and the system is inconsistent (which can be checked by analyzing the rank of the matrix and the augmented matrix).\n7.  By deriving the system and its determinant, we find that the condition `det(M(λ)) = 0` leads to a polynomial equation of degree `n` for `λ`. The roots of this polynomial are the characteristic values for which the equation may not have a unique solution.\n8.  Alternatively, using the Fredholm alternative theorem, the equation has no solution if `λ = 1/μ`, where `μ` is an eigenvalue of the integral operator `T[u] = ∫ K(x,y) u(y) dy`, and the function `f(x)=1` is not orthogonal to the corresponding eigenfunction of the adjoint operator `T*`.\n9.  Since the kernel `K(x,y)` is symmetric, the operator `T` is self-adjoint (`T* = T`). The condition for no solution simplifies to `∫ f(x)φ(x)dx ≠ 0`, where `φ` is an eigenfunction of `T` for the eigenvalue `μ`.\n10. We can find the eigenvalues `μ` by finding the eigenvalues of the matrix representation of the operator `T` in the monomial basis `{1, x, ..., xⁿ⁻¹}`. This matrix is `A` with elements `A_{ij} = 1/(n+j-i)` for `i,j` from `0` to `n-1`.\n11. The corresponding eigenvectors of `A` give the coefficients of the eigenfunctions `φ(x)`. The condition `∫ 1 * φ(x) dx ≠ 0` can then be checked for each eigenvector.\n12. The following Python code implements this procedure. It constructs the matrix `A`, finds its characteristic polynomial to form the equation for `λ`, and then calculates the specific values of `λ` for which no solution exists by computing the eigenvalues and eigenvectors and checking the orthogonality condition.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_for_n(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the integral equation for a given integer n.\n    Finds the values of lambda for which there is no solution.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not isinstance(n, int) or n < 1:\n        print(\"n must be a positive integer.\", file=sys.stderr)\n        return\n\n    print(f\"--- Results for n = {n} ---\")\n\n    # The problem reduces to analyzing the eigenvalues of the matrix A,\n    # where A[i, j] = 1 / (n + j - i) for i, j in {0, ..., n-1}.\n    # This matrix represents the integral operator in the basis {1, x, ..., x^(n-1)}.\n    A = np.zeros((n, n))\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            A[i, j] = 1.0 / (n + j - i)\n\n    # The characteristic values lambda are the roots of the polynomial\n    # det(I - lambda*A) = 0, which is equivalent to det(A - (1/lambda)*I) = 0.\n    # Let mu = 1/lambda.
