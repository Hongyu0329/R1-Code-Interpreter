    "My plan to solve this problem involves several steps based on Galois theory.\n\n1.  **Factor the Polynomial**: First, I will analyze the given polynomial $f(x) = x^7 - 2 x^5 - 9 x^3 + 3 x^2 + 18 x - 6$. I'll factor it over the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$ to understand its structure.\n\n2.  **Determine the Galois Group**: Once factored into irreducible polynomials, say $f(x) = g(x)h(x)$, I will determine the Galois group for each factor over $\\mathbb{Q}$. The Galois group of $f(x)$, let's call it $G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$, is related to the Galois groups of its factors. I will check if the splitting fields of the factors are disjoint (their intersection is $\\mathbb{Q}$). If they are, the Galois group $G$ is the direct product of the individual Galois groups.\n\n3.  **Apply the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory**: This theorem establishes a one-to-one correspondence between the subfields $L$ of the splitting field $K$ (where $\\mathbb{Q} \\subseteq L \\subseteq K$) and the subgroups $H$ of the Galois group $G$. A subfield extension $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is normal if and only if its corresponding subgroup $H$ is a normal subgroup of $G$. The degree of the extension, $[L:\\mathbb{Q}]$, is equal to the index of the subgroup, $[G:H] = |G|/|H|$.\n\n4.  **Find Normal Subgroups**: My task then becomes finding all proper, non-trivial normal subgroups $H$ of $G$ (i.e., $\\{e\\} \\subsetneq H \\subsetneq G$).\n\n5.  **Calculate Degrees**: For each normal subgroup $H$ found, I will calculate its index $|G|/|H|$. The set of these distinct index values will be the list of all possible degrees for the proper normal subfields $L$.\n\nI will use a Python script with the `sympy` library to perform the factorization and discriminant calculations, which are crucial for determining the structure of the Galois group. The script will then outline the group-theoretic arguments to find the normal subgroups and compute the corresponding degrees.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef find_possible_degrees():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function carries out the plan to find the possible degrees of normal subfields.\n    It prints the step-by-step reasoning and the final result.\n    \"\"\"\n    x = sympy.Symbol('x')\n    f = x**7 - 2*x**5 - 9*x**3 + 3*x**2 + 18*x - 6\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Factor the polynomial f(x) = x^7 - 2*x^5 - 9*x^3 + 3*x^2 + 18*x - 6\")\n    # A quick observation reveals a common factor:\n    # f(x) = x^5(x^2 - 2) - 9x(x^2 - 2) + 3(x^2 - 2)\n    # f(x) = (x^2 - 2)(x^5 - 9x + 3)\n    # We can confirm this with sympy.\n    factors = sympy.factor(f, domain='Q')\n    print(f\"The polynomial f(x) factors over Q as: {factors}\")\n    \n    g = x**2 - 2\n    h = x**5 - 9*x + 3\n    print(f\"Let g(x) = {g} and h(x) = {h}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Determine the Galois groups of the factors over Q.\")\n    # For g(x) = x^2 - 2\n    print(\"For g(x) = x^2 - 2:\")\n    print(\"The splitting field is K_g = Q(sqrt(2)).\")\n    print(\"The Galois group Gal(K_g/Q) is isomorphic to the cyclic group of order 2, Z_2.\")\n    \n    # For h(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3\n    print(\"\\nFor h(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3:\")\n    print(\"1.
