    "To determine the minimum number of vertices in a two-loop Feynman diagram for an interacting scalar field theory, we can use the topological relations that govern these diagrams.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the key formulas:** There are two fundamental formulas for a connected Feynman diagram:\n    *   `L = I - V + 1`, where `L` is the number of loops, `I` is the number of internal lines (propagators), and `V` is the number of vertices.\n    *   `n * V = 2 * I + E`, where `n` is the number of lines meeting at each vertex (e.g., n=4 for a $\\phi^4$ theory), and `E` is the number of external lines.\n\n2.  **Combine the formulas:** We can solve these two equations to express the number of vertices `V` in terms of the number of loops `L`, external lines `E`, and the interaction type `n`.\n\n3.  **Apply the problem's constraints:** We are given `L=2`. The problem asks for the *minimum* number of vertices, so we should consider the simplest interaction types (like `n=3` or `n=4`) and the minimum possible number of external lines (`E >= 0`).\n\n4.  **Calculate and Compare:** We will calculate the minimum `V` for different common theories and find the overall minimum. The simplest interacting scalar theory that is stable is the $\\phi^4$ theory, which often provides the minimum number of components for a given loop order. We will show the calculation for this case.\n\n```python\ndef solve_feynman_vertices():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the minimum number of vertices for a two-loop Feynman diagram\n    in an interacting scalar field theory.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"To find the minimum number of vertices (V), we use two topological formulas for a connected diagram:\")\n    print(\"1.
