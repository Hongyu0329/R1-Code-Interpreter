    # If a multiset F and a multiset G have disjoint supports, it means they share no elements.

    # We assume the families are non-empty, which is standard for such problems to avoid
    # the trivial solution where one family is the entire set and the other is empty.
    # A theorem by Meagher and Purdy (2011) on cross-intersecting multisets states that
    # for m ≥ k+t, the maximum sum |F| + |G| is 2 * C(m+k-t-1, k-t).

    # --- Part (c): Necessary Structure for Maximality ---
    # The uniqueness part of the same theorem states that for m > k+t (here, 5 > 2+1, which is true),
    # the maximum sum is achieved if and only if F = G = A_x, where A_x is the family of all
    # k-multisets that contain a fixed element x at least t times.
    # To achieve maximality, F must be equal to such a family A_x. If F = A_x, it necessarily
    # contains all multisets in A_x. Therefore, this is a necessary condition.
