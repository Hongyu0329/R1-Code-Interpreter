    "Of course. The ideal Ni/Ce ratio for catalytic performance is not a value that can be derived from a simple calculation but is determined through extensive experimental research found in scientific literature. The optimal ratio represents a balance between having enough active Ni sites and maintaining a strong, beneficial interaction with the ceria support, which promotes the reaction by creating oxygen vacancies.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify Optimal Loading:** Based on a review of scientific studies on Ni-Ceria catalysts for Water Gas Shift (WGS) and water splitting, an optimal loading of Nickel is frequently reported to be around **12 wt%** (weight percent).\n2.  **Convert to Atomic Ratio:** The user asked for the Ni/Ce atomic ratio. I will write a Python script to convert this 12 wt% loading into the corresponding atomic ratio (moles of Ni / moles of Ce).\n3.  **Perform the Calculation:** The script will use the molar masses of Nickel (Ni) and Cerium (Ce) to perform the conversion. It will assume a 100g sample of the catalyst for the calculation.\n4.  **Display the Steps:** As requested, the script will print out each step of the calculation, showing all the numbers involved in deriving the final ratio.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef calculate_ideal_ni_ce_ratio():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the ideal Ni/Ce atomic ratio based on an optimal weight percent\n    found in scientific literature for Ni-Ceria catalysts.\n\n    The calculation is based on a 100g sample of the catalyst.\n    \"\"\"\n    # --- Step 1: Define constants based on literature and chemical data ---\n    # Optimal Ni loading is often cited around 12 wt% for WGS reactions.\n    optimal_ni_wt_percent = 12.0\n\n    # Molar masses (g/mol)\n    molar_mass_ni = 58.69\n    molar_mass_ce = 140.12\n    molar_mass_o = 16.00\n    molar_mass_ceo2 = molar_mass_ce + 2 * molar_mass_o\n\n    print(\"--- Finding the Ideal Ni/Ce Atomic Ratio ---\")\n    print(f\"Based on experimental literature, an optimal Ni loading is ~{optimal_ni_wt_percent} wt%.\")\n    print(\"This script converts this weight percent to an atomic ratio.\\n\")\n\n    # --- Step 2: Calculate mass of each component in a 100g sample ---\n    mass_ni = optimal_ni_wt_percent\n    mass_ceo2 = 100.0 - mass_ni\n\n    print(\"--- Calculation Steps (for a 100g sample) ---\")\n    print(f\"1.
