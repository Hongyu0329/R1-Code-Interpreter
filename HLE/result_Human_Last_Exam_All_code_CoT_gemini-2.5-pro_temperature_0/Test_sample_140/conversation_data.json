    "To solve this problem, we need to figure out the most efficient way to pack 9x1x1 blocks into a 15x15x15 cube. A simple division of volumes (15*15*15 / 9*1*1 = 375) gives an upper limit, but it doesn't account for the wasted space due to the shapes not fitting perfectly.\n\nA better approach is to pack the blocks in stages, filling a section of the cube completely and then moving to the remaining space.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  **Stage 1:** We take the 15x15x15 cube and align the 9-unit length of the blocks with one of the 15-unit edges of the cube. This allows us to perfectly fill a 9x15x15 section of the cube.\n2.  **Stage 2:** This leaves a remaining space of (15-9)x15x15, which is 6x15x15. We can't align the 9-unit length of the blocks with the 6-unit edge, so we must align it with one of the 15-unit edges. This fills a 6x9x15 section of the remaining space.\n3.  **Stage 3:** Now, the remaining space is 6x(15-9)x15, which is 6x6x15. We must align the 9-unit length of the blocks with the 15-unit edge. This fills a 6x6x9 section.\n4.  **Final Step:** The space left is 6x6x(15-9), or 6x6x6. Since the largest dimension of this space is 6, no more 9x1x1 blocks can fit.\n5.  The total number of blocks is the sum of the blocks from each stage.\n\nThe following Python code calculates the number of blocks for each stage and then sums them up.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_packing():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the maximum number of 9x1x1 blocks that fit inside a 15x15x15 cube.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Stage 1: Pack a 9x15x15 section of the 15x15x15 cube.\n    # We align the block's length of 9 with a cube edge of 15.\n    # Number of blocks = floor(15/9) * floor(15/1) * floor(15/1)\n    blocks_stage1 = (15 // 9) * (15 // 1) * (15 // 1)\n\n    # This leaves a remaining space of (15-9) x 15 x 15 = 6x15x15.\n\n    # Stage 2: Pack the 6x15x15 remaining space.\n    # We must align the block's length of 9 with a 15-unit edge.\n    # Number of blocks = floor(6/1) * floor(15/9) * floor(15/1)\n    blocks_stage2 = (6 // 1) * (15 // 9) * (15 // 1)\n\n    # This leaves a remaining space of 6 x (15-9) x 15 = 6x6x15.\n\n    # Stage 3: Pack the 6x6x15 remaining space.\n    # We must align the block's length of 9 with the 15-unit edge.\n    # Number of blocks = floor(6/1) * floor(6/1) * floor(15/9)\n    blocks_stage3 = (6 // 1) * (6 // 1) * (15 // 9)\n\n    # The final remaining space is 6x6x(15-9) = 6x6x6, where no more blocks fit.\n\n    total_blocks = blocks_stage1 + blocks_stage2 + blocks_stage3\n\n    print(\"The maximum number of blocks is found by packing in stages:\")\n    print(f\"1. In a 9x15x15 section: {blocks_stage1} blocks\")\n    print(f\"2. In the remaining 6x15x15 space, we fill a 6x9x15 section with: {blocks_stage2} blocks\")\n    print(f\"3. In the final 6x6x15 space, we fill a 6x6x9 section with: {blocks_stage3} blocks\")\n    print(\"\\nThe total number of blocks is the sum of these stages:\")\n    print(f\"{blocks_stage1} + {blocks_stage2} + {blocks_stage3} = {total_blocks}\")\n\nsolve_packing()\n<<<351>>>\n```"
