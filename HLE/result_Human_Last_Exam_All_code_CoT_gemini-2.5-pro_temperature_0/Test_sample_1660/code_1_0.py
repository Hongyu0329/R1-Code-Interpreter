    # The core of the question is to compare the danger levels of two chemicals.
    # In toxicology, the most common and direct measure of acute toxicity is the LD50 value.
    # LD50 (Lethal Dose, 50%) is the amount of a substance that is lethal to 50% of a test population.
    # A lower LD50 value means a substance is more toxic.

    # LD50 values for the two compounds (oral, in rats, which is a standard model):
    ld50_tmt_cl = 12.6  # mg/kg
    ld50_tbt_cl = 129   # mg/kg

    print("Comparing the acute toxicity of Trimethyltin chloride (TMT-Cl) and Tributyltin chloride (TBT-Cl):")
    print(f"  - The oral LD50 for TMT-Cl in rats is approximately {ld50_tmt_cl} mg/kg.")
    print(f"  - The oral LD50 for TBT-Cl in rats is approximately {ld50_tbt_cl} mg/kg.")
    print("\nConclusion:")
    print("A significantly lower LD50 value indicates a much higher level of acute toxicity.")
    print("Since the LD50 of TMT-Cl is about ten times lower than that of TBT-Cl, it is considered substantially more dangerous.")
    print("While other factors like reactivity, cell permeability, and metabolism contribute to this difference, the LD50 value is the most direct and important quantitative measure of this danger.")
    print("\nTherefore, the most important factor is the significantly lower LD50 value of TMT-Cl.")
