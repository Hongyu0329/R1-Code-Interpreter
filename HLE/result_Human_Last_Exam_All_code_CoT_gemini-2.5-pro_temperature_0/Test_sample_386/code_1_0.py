    # The goal is to isolate corneal fibroblasts, which originate from stromal keratocytes.
    # The standard procedure involves several key steps.

    # Step 1: Isolate the stroma.
    # This requires removing the outer epithelial layer and the inner endothelial layer.
    isolation_procedure = "Debridement of both the epithelium and endothelium."

    # Step 2: Culture the stromal cells.
    # A medium containing serum is required to stimulate proliferation and transformation into fibroblasts.
    # A typical medium includes Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS) and antibiotics.

    expected_behavior = "Cells adhere to the bottom of the flask."

    # Evaluating the options:
    # A is incorrect because healthy cells should adhere, not prevent themselves from adhering.
    # B is incorrect because it uses limbal cells (epithelial origin) and a toxic (5%) antibiotic concentration.
    # D is incorrect because it confuses the origin of myofibroblasts (they come from stroma, not limbal cells).
    # E is incorrect because it omits the debridement of the endothelium and uses the contradictory term "serum-free medium" with a percentage.
