    "My plan is to solve the Sudoku puzzle and then print the top row.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the visual representation of the Sudoku puzzle into a 9x9 grid that my code can work with. The input is formatted like a LaTeX matrix. After careful inspection, I've determined a consistent rule for parsing: the grid is divided by `|` characters, and within each block, every two `&` separators correspond to one cell in the Sudoku grid. For example, in the first row of numbers, `& 5 &` corresponds to the first cell, `&  &  &` to the second, and so on.\n\nAfter parsing the entire matrix based on this rule, I will have the initial 9x9 grid with zeros representing the empty cells.\n\nNext, I will implement a standard backtracking algorithm to solve this Sudoku puzzle. The algorithm will:\n1.  Find an empty cell.\n2.  Try placing numbers from 1 to 9 in that cell.\n3.  For each number, it checks if placing it violates any Sudoku rules (i.e., the number already exists in the same row, column, or 3x3 block).\n4.  If the number is valid, it recursively calls itself to solve the rest of the puzzle.\n5.  If the recursion leads to a solution, the puzzle is solved. If not, it backtracks by resetting the cell to zero and tries the next number.\n\nOnce the solver finds the complete solution, I will extract the first row of the solved 9x9 grid and print the nine numbers separated by spaces, as requested.\n\n```python\ndef solve_sudoku():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the Sudoku puzzle provided in the problem description.\n    The puzzle is first parsed from its visual format into a 9x9 grid.\n    Then, a backtracking algorithm finds the solution.\n    Finally, it prints the top horizontal line of the solved puzzle.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The grid is parsed from the LaTeX-style matrix in the prompt.\n    # 0 represents an empty cell.\n    grid = [\n        [5, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 4, 9],\n        [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0],\n        [0, 6, 7, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1],\n        [1, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 8],\n        [7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 1, 5, 0],\n        [0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0],\n        [4, 9, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 3]\n    ]\n\n    def find_empty(bo):\n        \"\"\"Finds an empty cell in the board\"\"\"\n        for i in range(len(bo)):\n            for j in range(len(bo[0])):\n                if bo[i][j] == 0:\n                    return (i, j)  # row, col\n        return None\n\n    def is_valid(bo, num, pos):\n        \"\"\"Checks if a number is valid in a given position\"\"\"\n        # Check row\n        for i in range(len(bo[0])):\n            if bo[pos[0]][i] == num and pos[1] != i:\n                return False\n\n        # Check column\n        for i in range(len(bo)):\n            if bo[i][pos[1]] == num and pos[0] != i:\n                return False\n\n        # Check box\n        box_x = pos[1] // 3\n        box_y = pos[0] // 3\n\n        for i in range(box_y*3, box_y*3 + 3):\n            for j in range(box_x * 3, box_x*3 + 3):\n                if bo[i][j] == num and (i,j) != pos:\n                    return False\n        return True\n\n    def solve():\n        \"\"\"\n        Solves the sudoku board using backtracking\n        \"\"\"\n        find = find_empty(grid)\n        if not find:\n            return True\n        else:\n            row, col = find\n\n        for i in range(1,10):\n            if is_valid(grid, i, (row, col)):\n                grid[row][col] = i\n\n                if solve():\n                    return True\n\n                grid[row][col] = 0\n        return False\n\n    solve()\n    \n    # Print the top horizontal line of the solved sudoku\n    # The problem asks to output each number in the final equation.\n    # This is interpreted as printing the space-separated numbers of the first row.\n    print(' '.join(map(str, grid[0])))\n\nsolve_sudoku()\n```\n<<<5 1 2 7 8 3 6 4 9>>>"
