    "The earliest known date recorded by a pre-Columbian civilization is found on Stela 2 from the archaeological site of Chiapa de Corzo in Chiapas, Mexico. The date is inscribed using the Mesoamerican Long Count calendar system.\n\nThe Long Count date is **7.16.3.2.13**.\n\nThis calendar system counts the number of days that have passed since a mythological starting point, equivalent to August 11, 3114 BCE in the proleptic Gregorian calendar. The date 7.16.3.2.13 can be converted to a total number of days and then to a specific date in our calendar.\n\nThe following Python code calculates the total number of days represented by this Long Count date and states its equivalent in the Gregorian calendar.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_earliest_date():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the earliest recorded pre-Columbian date.\n    The date is 7.16.3.2.13 from Stela 2 at Chiapa de Corzo.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Long Count date components\n    baktun = 7\n    katun = 16\n    tun = 3\n    winal = 2\n    kin = 13\n\n    # Days per unit\n    days_in_kin = 1\n    days_in_winal = 20 * days_in_kin\n    days_in_tun = 18 * days_in_winal\n    days_in_katun = 20 * days_in_tun\n    days_in_baktun = 20 * days_in_katun\n\n    # Calculate total days for each component\n    total_days_from_baktun = baktun * days_in_baktun\n    total_days_from_katun = katun * days_in_katun\n    total_days_from_tun = tun * days_in_tun\n    total_days_from_winal = winal * days_in_winal\n    total_days_from_kin = kin * days_in_kin\n\n    # Calculate total days since the Long Count epoch\n    total_days = (total_days_from_baktun +\n                  total_days_from_katun +\n                  total_days_from_tun +\n                  total_days_from_winal +\n                  total_days_from_kin)\n\n    print(\"The earliest recorded date in a pre-Columbian writing system is 7.16.3.2.13 in the Mesoamerican Long Count calendar.\")\n    print(\"This date is found on Stela 2 from Chiapa de Corzo, Mexico.\")\n    print(\"\\nTo understand this date, we convert it into a total number of days since the calendar's starting point (August 11, 3114 BCE).\")\n    print(\"\\nThe calculation is as follows:\")\n    print(f\"{baktun} B'ak'tun = {baktun} * {days_in_baktun} = {total_days_from_baktun} days\")\n    print(f\"{katun} K'atun  = {katun} * {days_in_katun} = {total_days_from_katun} days\")\n    print(f\"{tun} Tun     = {tun} * {days_in_tun} = {total_days_from_tun} days\")\n    print(f\"{winal} Winal   = {winal} * {days_in_winal} = {total_days_from_winal} days\")\n    print(f\"{kin} K'in    = {kin} * {days_in_kin} = {total_days_from_kin} days\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nThe final equation for the total number of days is:\")\n    print(f\"{total_days_from_baktun} + {total_days_from_katun} + {total_days_from_tun} + {total_days_from_winal} + {total_days_from_kin} = {total_days} days\")\n\n    print(f\"\\nThis total of {total_days} days from the start date corresponds to a specific date in the Gregorian calendar.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe earliest known recorded date is: December 8, 36 BCE.\")\n\ncalculate_earliest_date()\n```\n<<<December 8, 36 BCE>>>"
