    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is the plan to solve this problem, followed by the Python code to execute the plan.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The request is to find the 4-point Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) of an 8-point sequence. This 8-point sequence, let's call it `y(n)`, is formed by interleaving two 4-point sequences, `x(n)` and `h(n)`. We are given the 4-point DFTs of `x(n)` and `h(n)`, which are `X(k)` and `H(k)`.\n\n2.  **Interpret the \"4-point DFT of an 8-point sequence\":** A standard N-point DFT is defined for an N-point sequence. Applying a 4-point DFT to an 8-point sequence is ambiguous. The most common interpretation in signal processing, especially given the interleaved structure of `y(n)`, is to find the even-indexed components of the 8-point DFT of `y(n)`. This is known as decimation in frequency. So, if `Y(k)` is the 8-point DFT of `y(n)`, we need to find `Z(k) = {Y(0), Y(2), Y(4), Y(6)}`.\n\n3.  **Relate DFTs:** The interleaved sequence is `y(n) = {x(0), h(0), x(1), h(1), x(2), h(2), x(3), h(3)}`. This means `y(2m) = x(m)` and `y(2m+1) = h(m)` for `m = 0, 1, 2, 3`. Using the decimation-in-time principle of the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), we can relate the 8-point DFT `Y(k)` to the 4-point DFTs `X(k)` and `H(k)`:\n    *   `Y(k) = X(k) + W_8^k * H(k)` for `k = 0, 1, 2, 3`\n    *   `Y(k+4) = X(k) - W_8^k * H(k)` for `k = 0, 1, 2, 3`\n    where `W_8^k = exp(-j*2*pi*k/8)` is the twiddle factor.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Required Components:** We need to compute `Y(0)`, `Y(2)`, `Y(4)`, and `Y(6)`.\n    *   `Z(0) = Y(0) = X(0) + W_8^0 * H(0)`\n    *   `Z(1) = Y(2) = X(2) + W_8^2 * H(2)`\n    *   `Z(2) = Y(4) = Y(0+4) = X(0) - W_8^0 * H(0)`\n    *   `Z(3) = Y(6) = Y(2+4) = X(2) - W_8^2 * H(2)`\n\n5.  **Execute the Calculation:** Substitute the given values for `X(k)`, `H(k)`, and the necessary twiddle factors (`W_8^0 = 1`, `W_8^2 = -j`) to find the final result. The code will perform these substitutions and calculations, printing each step as requested.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_dft_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the 4-point DFT for the interleaved sequence as described.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Given 4-point DFTs\n    X = np.array([1, 1j, -1, -1j], dtype=complex)\n    H = np.array([0, 1+1j, 1, 1-1j], dtype=complex)\n\n    print(\"The problem is to find the 4-point DFT of the 8-point sequence y(n) formed by interleaving x(n) and h(n).\")\n    print(\"This is interpreted as finding the even-indexed components of the 8-point DFT of y(n), which we call Z(k).\")\n    print(\"Z(k) = {Y(0), Y(2), Y(4), Y(6)}\\n\")\n    print(\"The calculation steps are as follows:\\n\")\n\n    # Twiddle factors needed: W_8^0 = 1 and W_8^2 = -j\n    W_8_0 = np.exp(-1j * 2 * np.pi * 0 / 8)\n    W_8_2 = np.exp(-1j * 2 * np.pi * 2 / 8)\n\n    # --- Calculate Z(0) = Y(0) ---\n    k0 = 0\n    # Y(0) = X(0) + W_8^0 * H(0)\n    Y0 = X[k0] + W_8_0 * H[k0]\n    print(f\"Z(0) = Y(0) = X(0) + W_8^0 * H(0) = {X[k0]} + (1) * {H[k0]} = {np.round(Y0, 10)}\")\n\n    # --- Calculate Z(1) = Y(2) ---\n    k2 = 2\n    # Y(2) = X(2) + W_8^2 * H(2)\n    Y2 = X[k2] + W_8_2 * H[k2]\n    print(f\"Z(1) = Y(2) = X(2) + W_8^2 * H(2) = {X[k2]} + (-1j) * {H[k2]} = {np.round(Y2, 10)}\")\n\n    # --- Calculate Z(2) = Y(4) ---\n    # Y(4) = X(0) - W_8^0 * H(0)\n    Y4 = X[k0] - W_8_0 * H[k0]\n    print(f\"Z(2) = Y(4) = X(0) - W_8^0 * H(0) = {X[k0]} - (1) * {H[k0]} = {np.round(Y4, 10)}\")\n\n    # --- Calculate Z(3) = Y(6) ---\n    # Y(6) = X(2) - W_8^2 * H(2)\n    Y6 = X[k2] - W_8_2 * H[k2]\n    print(f\"Z(3) = Y(6) = X(2) - W_8^2 * H(2) = {X[k2]} - (-1j) * {H[k2]} = {np.round(Y6, 10)}\")\n\n    # --- Final Result ---\n    Z = [Y0, Y2, Y4, Y6]\n    Z_cleaned = np.round(Z, 10)\n    \n    print(\"\\n--------------------------------------------------\")\n    print(\"The final resulting 4-point DFT is:\")\n    print(f\"Z = [{Z_cleaned[0]}, {Z_cleaned[1]}, {Z_cleaned[2]}, {Z_cleaned[3]}]\")\n    print(\"--------------------------------------------------\")\n\nsolve_dft_problem()\n<<<[1, (-1-1j), 1, (-1+1j)]>>>\n```"
