# The problem asks to evaluate the expression:
# (2 * ||alpha||^2) / ((pi^2 / 6) - 1) + 10^15
#
# Based on the derivation, we found that:
# ||alpha||^2 = (1/2) * ((pi^2 / 6) - 1)

# The final equation can be simplified as follows:
# (2 * (1/2) * ((pi^2 / 6) - 1)) / ((pi^2 / 6) - 1) + 10^15
# = ((pi^2 / 6) - 1) / ((pi^2 / 6) - 1) + 10^15
# = 1 + 10^15

# Define the numbers in the final simplified equation
term1 = 1
term2 = 10**15

# Calculate the final result
# We use integer arithmetic for precision with large numbers.
final_result = term1 + int(term2)

# As requested, we output each number in the final equation.
# We will show the components of the original expression.
