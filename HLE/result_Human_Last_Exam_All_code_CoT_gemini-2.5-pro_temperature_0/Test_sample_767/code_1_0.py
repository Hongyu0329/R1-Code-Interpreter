# The problem is to find the limit of p(N)/N as N approaches infinity.
# This limit can be found by determining the number of solutions for a very large m.

# Each of the 7 coefficients (a, b, c, d, e, f, g) can be an integer from -25 to 25.
# The number of choices for each coefficient is 25 - (-25) + 1.
num_choices_per_coeff = 51
num_coeffs = 7

# The total number of possible tuples of coefficients is (num_choices_per_coeff)^num_coeffs.
total_tuples = num_choices_per_coeff ** num_coeffs

# For large m, a solution for n exists if the polynomial P(F_m) <= 0.
# This happens if all coefficients are zero (1 case), or if the first non-zero coefficient is negative.
# By symmetry, half of the non-zero tuples have a negative first non-zero coefficient.
# Number of non-zero tuples is total_tuples - 1.
# Number of favorable tuples = 1 (for the zero tuple) + (total_tuples - 1) / 2
# This simplifies to (total_tuples + 1) / 2.
limit_value = (total_tuples + 1) // 2
