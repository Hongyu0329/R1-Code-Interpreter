    # --- Step 1: Calculate N (Guaranteed correct guesses in the simultaneous scenario) ---

    # For a single color dimension (e.g., Black/Yellow) and an odd number of people 'k',
    # the maximum number of guaranteed correct guesses is (k-1)/2.

    # The number of correct people is the size of the intersection of the sets of people
    # who are correct for the B/Y property and the Bl/W property.
    # Using the inclusion-exclusion principle, the minimum size of this intersection is:
    # max(0, |correct_set_1| + |correct_set_2| - total_people)
    # In the worst case, the number of correct people for each dimension is the minimum guaranteed, N_one_dimension.
    N = max(0, N_one_dimension + N_one_dimension - k)

    # --- Step 2: Calculate M (Guaranteed correct guesses in the sequential scenario) ---

    # One person guesses first. They can use their guess to convey information.
    # The guess has two parts (e.g., "Yellow, White"), so it can encode two bits of information.
    # Strategy: The first person communicates the parity of the other 8 people's hats for each of the two color dimensions.
    # This allows the remaining 8 individuals to deduce their own hat colors perfectly.
    # The first person's guess is not guaranteed to be correct.
    # Therefore, the number of guaranteed correct guesses is the number of people who guess second.
    M = num_individuals - 1
