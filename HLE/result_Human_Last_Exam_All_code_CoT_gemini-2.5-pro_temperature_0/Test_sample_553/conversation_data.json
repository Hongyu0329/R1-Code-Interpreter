    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to identify the song:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Music Theory:** The user is asking for a Beatles song with a specific opening chord progression.\n    *   **Tonic:** This is the \"home\" chord of the song's key, also known as the 'I' chord.\n    *   **Minor Fifth Chord:** In a major key, the chord built on the fifth scale degree is naturally a major chord (the 'V' chord). A \"minor fifth\" ('v' chord) is a borrowed chord, typically from the parallel minor key, which creates a very distinct, often melancholic sound.\n    *   **The Progression:** The song must start by moving directly from the I chord to the v chord.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Beatles' Catalog:** I will search for a song that matches this specific I -> v opening. This is a relatively uncommon progression, which makes it a strong identifier.\n\n3.  **Identify the Song:** The song \"Michelle\" from the 1965 album *Rubber Soul* is the most famous example of this. The song is in the key of F major.\n    *   The **tonic (I)** chord is F major.\n    *   The **minor fifth (v)** chord is C minor.\n    *   The song's iconic instrumental introduction begins with this exact F major to C minor chord change.\n\n4.  **Generate the Code:** I will create a Python script that prints out this information clearly.\n\n```python\ndef find_beatles_song():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and provides details about the Beatles song\n    that starts with a chord jump from the tonic to the minor fifth.\n    \"\"\"\n    song_title = \"Michelle\"\n    album = \"Rubber Soul\"\n    year = 1965\n    key = \"F Major\"\n    \n    # In the key of F Major:\n    # The tonic chord (I) is F Major.\n    # The fifth scale degree is C. A normal V chord would be C Major.\n    # A minor fifth chord (v) is C minor.\n    \n    tonic_chord_name = \"F Major\"\n    tonic_chord_number = 1 # Represents the 'I' chord\n    \n    minor_fifth_chord_name = \"C minor\"\n    minor_fifth_chord_number = 5 # Represents the 'v' chord\n    \n    print(f\"The song by The Beatles that starts with a chord jump from the tonic to the minor fifth is '{song_title}'.\")\n    print(\"\\n--- Musical Details ---\")\n    print(f\"Album: {album} ({year})\")\n    print(f\"Key of the song: {key}\")\n    print(\"\\nThe opening chord progression is:\")\n    \n    # The prompt requested to output each number in the final equation.\n    # We will represent the chord progression as an equation of chord numbers.\n    print(f\"Chord {tonic_chord_number} ({tonic_chord_name}) -> Chord {minor_fifth_chord_number} ({minor_fifth_chord_name})\")\n    print(\"\\nThis progression from the tonic (I) to a minor fifth (v) is a key element of the song's unique character.\")\n\nfind_beatles_song()\n```\n<<<Michelle>>>"
