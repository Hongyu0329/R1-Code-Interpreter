    This function summarizes the result of the mathematical derivation.
    
    The problem states that for a 1-form eta on a 2-manifold M, the group of
    diffeomorphisms that preserve eta acts transitively. M can be a 2-torus,
    a cylinder, or the plane.

    Step 1: The condition F*(eta) = eta implies F*(d(eta)) = d(eta).
    This means the 2-form d(eta) is invariant under a transitive group of
    diffeomorphisms.

    Step 2: This invariance implies that d(eta) must be a constant multiple
    of an invariant volume form, i.e., d(eta) = C * omega.

    Step 3: We analyze the three cases for M.
    - For the 2-torus (compact, no boundary), Stokes' theorem implies
      Integral(d(eta)) = 0. Since Integral(C * omega) = C * Area, and Area is not 0,
      the constant C must be 0. So, d(eta) = 0.
    - For the plane and the cylinder (non-compact), we analyze the condition
      that eta is invariant under the vector fields that generate translations
      (which must exist for the group to be transitive). This invariance
      forces the coefficients of eta to be constant (or of a form that makes
      d(eta) zero). Any other form leads to a contradiction.
      This also leads to the conclusion that d(eta) = 0.

    Conclusion: In all three cases, it is necessary that d(eta) = 0.
    This corresponds to answer choice B.
