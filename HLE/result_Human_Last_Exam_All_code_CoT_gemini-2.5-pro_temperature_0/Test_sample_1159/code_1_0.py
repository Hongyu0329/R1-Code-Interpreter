    # To correctly distinguish 0 from x_min, we must resolve events
    # on the scale of the interval that rounds to 0, which is [0, x_min / 2).
    # The probability 'p' of a uniform variable U in [0,1] falling into this
    # interval is p = x_min / 2.
    # p = 2^(1 - B - m) / 2 = 2^(-(B + m))

    # From information theory, the number of bits needed to specify an event
    # with probability 'p' is log2(1/p).
