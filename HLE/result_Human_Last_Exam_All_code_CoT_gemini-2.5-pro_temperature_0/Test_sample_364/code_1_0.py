    # Option A: Negative linear relationship between EPO and Barkovich score
    # EPO (Erythropoietin) is often investigated as a neuroprotective agent, so a negative relationship
    # (higher EPO, lower/better score) is biologically plausible. However, this specific association
    # is not the most consistently or strongly reported finding in major studies compared to others.
    print("A. Negative linear relationship between EPO and Barkovich score: This is not the most prominently cited association in the literature.")

    # Option B: Positive linear relationship between GM-CSF and Weeke grey matter score
    # A positive relationship between a pro-inflammatory cytokine like GM-CSF and an injury score is plausible.
    # However, this specific link is less frequently documented than the association in option D.
    print("B. Positive linear relationship between GM-CSF and Weeke grey matter score: This specific link is not as well-documented as other options.")

    # Option C: Negative linear relationship between IL-8 and NICHD NRN score
    # IL-8 is a pro-inflammatory cytokine. Higher levels are generally associated with more severe injury.
    # Therefore, a positive, not negative, relationship would be expected (higher IL-8, higher/worse injury score).
    print("C. Negative linear relationship between IL-8 and NICHD NRN score: This is biologically counter-intuitive as IL-8 is pro-inflammatory.")

    # Option D: Positive linear relationship between VEGF and Weeke white matter score
    # This association has been specifically reported in the literature. For instance, a 2018 study by
    # O'Dea et al. in 'Developmental Neuroscience' found a significant positive linear relationship
    # between umbilical cord blood VEGF (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor) concentrations and the
    # Weeke white matter injury score, indicating that higher VEGF levels were associated with more severe white matter injury.
    print("D. Positive linear relationship between VEGF and Weeke white matter score: This association is directly supported by published research.")

    # Option E: Positive linear relationship between GM-CSF and Barkovich score
    # Similar to option B, this is a plausible relationship, but the evidence for the association in option D is more direct and specific in key studies.
    print("E. Positive linear relationship between GM-CSF and Barkovich score: While plausible, the association in option D is more specifically reported in key studies.")
