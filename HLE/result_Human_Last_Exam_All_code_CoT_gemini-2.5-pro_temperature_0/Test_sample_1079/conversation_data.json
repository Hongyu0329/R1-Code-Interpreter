    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of elements in the H3 reflection group that satisfy a specific condition. Here is the step-by-step plan to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Interpret the Question:** The question asks for the number of elements in the H3 reflection group that have a \"regular eigenvector\" with a corresponding eigenvalue of order 10. The Coxeter number for H3 is indeed 10.\n\n2.  **Connect to Regular Elements:** In the theory of Coxeter groups, an element `w` is defined as \"regular\" if it possesses a regular eigenvector (a vector not lying on any of the reflection hyperplanes). A key theorem by T.A. Springer states that an element is regular if and only if it is conjugate to a power `c^k` of a Coxeter element `c`, where `k` is coprime to the Coxeter number `h`.\n\n3.  **Check Eigenvalues of Regular Elements:** For the H3 group, the Coxeter number is `h=10` and the degrees are `d_1=2, d_2=6, d_3=10`. The eigenvalues of any regular element `w` are of the form `exp(2πik(d_j-1)/h)` for `j=1,2,3`, where `gcd(k,h)=1`. For H3, this gives eigenvalues with orders `10/gcd(k,10)=10`, `2/gcd(k,2)=2`, and `10/gcd(9k,10)=10`. This means that *every* regular element in H3 automatically has eigenvalues of order 10.\n\n4.  **Simplify the Problem:** Therefore, the problem is reduced to finding the total number of regular elements in the H3 group.\n\n5.  **Apply the Formula:** The number of regular elements in a finite Coxeter group `W` is given by the well-known formula:\n    `Number of regular elements = |W| * φ(h) / h`\n    where:\n    *   `|W|` is the order of the group. For H3, `|W| = 120`.\n    *   `h` is the Coxeter number. For H3, `h = 10`.\n    *   `φ(h)` is Euler's totient function, which counts the positive integers up to `h` that are relatively prime to `h`.\n\n6.  **Execute the Calculation:** I will now provide a Python script to perform this calculation. The script will define the parameters for H3, compute `φ(10)`, and apply the formula to find the final answer, printing the equation as requested.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef euler_totient(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates Euler's totient function phi(n).\n    It counts the numbers from 1 to n that are relatively prime to n.\n    \"\"\"\n    count = 0\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        if math.gcd(i, n) == 1:\n            count += 1\n    return count\n\n# Define the parameters for the reflection group of type H3\ngroup_order = 120\ncoxeter_number = 10\n\n# The problem is equivalent to finding the number of regular elements in H3.\n# The formula is: N = |W| * phi(h) / h\n\n# Calculate Euler's totient function for the Coxeter number\nphi_h = euler_totient(coxeter_number)\n\n# Calculate the total number of elements\nnum_elements = (group_order * phi_h) // coxeter_number\n\n# Print the final equation and the result\nprint(\"The number of elements is found using the formula: |W| * phi(h) / h\")\nprint(f\"For the H3 group, the order |W| = {group_order}.\")\nprint(f\"The Coxeter number h = {coxeter_number}.\")\nprint(f\"Euler's totient function, phi({coxeter_number}), is {phi_h}.\")\nprint(f\"The final calculation is: {group_order} * {phi_h} / {coxeter_number} = {num_elements}\")\n```\n<<<48>>>"
