def find_closepact_sets():
    """
    This function determines which of the given sets are necessarily "closepact".

    The logic is based on the equivalence of "closepact" and "compact" for the
    given types of sets (subsets of R or C). A set is compact if and only if
    it is closed and bounded. The function identifies the choices that describe
    sets that are always closed and bounded.
