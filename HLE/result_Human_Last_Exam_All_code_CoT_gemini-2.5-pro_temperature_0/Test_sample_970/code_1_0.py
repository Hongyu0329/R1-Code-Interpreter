The question asks for the necessary assumption to prove that a Bayesian agent's expected information gain approaches zero as time goes to infinity. The expected information gain is the expected change in the agent's belief state from one time step to the next, measured by the KL divergence: $E[KL(posterior_{t+1} || posterior_t)]$.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1.  **Total Information Gain is Bounded by Prior Entropy:** A fundamental result in Bayesian statistics is that the total expected information gain an agent can acquire is bounded. The sum of all expected information gains over an infinite horizon is less than or equal to the entropy of the agent's initial prior distribution over models, H(prior).
    
    $E[\sum_{t=0}^{\infty} KL(posterior_{t+1} || posterior_t)] \leq H(prior)$

2.  **Convergence of a Sum of Non-Negative Terms:** The KL divergence is always non-negative. For an infinite sum of non-negative terms to be a finite number (as it must be if the prior entropy is finite), the terms themselves must converge to zero.

3.  **Conclusion on Necessary Assumption:** This entire argument relies on the upper bound, H(prior), being a finite number. If the prior has infinite entropy, the total information gain could also be infinite, and there would be no guarantee that the per-step information gain must approach zero. Therefore, the assumption that **(a) The prior has finite entropy** is necessary for the proof.

4.  **Why Other Options Are Not Necessary:**
    *   (b), (c): These are strong assumptions about the environment's structure and the agent's long-term behavior. While useful for proving that the agent learns the *true* model in complex interactive settings (like Reinforcement Learning), they are not required for the more general result that the agent simply *stops learning* (i.e., information gain goes to zero).
    *   (d): Assuming i.i.d. observations is a special case. The result holds more generally for interactive agents, so this is not a necessary assumption.
    *   (e): The posterior entropy approaching zero is a potential *result* of learning, indicating the agent has become certain. It is not a prerequisite *assumption* for the proof. The information gain can go to zero even if the agent remains uncertain between several models.

Based on this analysis, the only necessary assumption is (a). We will now format this answer into Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF).
