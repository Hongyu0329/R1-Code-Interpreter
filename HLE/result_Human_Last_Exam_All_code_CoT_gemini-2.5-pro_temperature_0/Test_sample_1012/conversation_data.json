    "The threat of quantum computers to cryptography varies depending on the type of cryptographic algorithm. For symmetric-key algorithms like AES, the primary threat comes from Grover's algorithm.\n\nGrover's algorithm can search an unstructured database (like the space of all possible cryptographic keys) quadratically faster than a classical computer. This means that for a symmetric key of length `N` bits, which has a keyspace of 2^N, a classical brute-force attack would take approximately 2^N operations. However, a quantum computer using Grover's algorithm could break it in approximately sqrt(2^N) = 2^(N/2) operations.\n\nThis effectively halves the security level in bits. To maintain a desired security level against a quantum computer, the key length must be doubled. The current standard for strong security against classical computers is 128 bits (e.g., AES-128). To achieve this same 128-bit level of security against a quantum computer, we need a key of 256 bits.\n\nThe following Python code calculates this minimum required key length.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_quantum_resistant_key_length():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the minimum symmetric key length required to be secure against\n    a quantum computer.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The desired security level in bits. 128 bits is the current standard\n    # for strong security against classical attacks.\n    target_security_level = 128\n\n    # Grover's algorithm provides a quadratic speedup, effectively halving the\n    # bit security of a symmetric key. So, we need to double the key length.\n    # The equation is: Required_Key_Length / 2 = Target_Security_Level\n    grover_factor = 2\n    required_key_length = target_security_level * grover_factor\n\n    print(\"The primary quantum attack on symmetric keys is Grover's algorithm.\")\n    print(\"It provides a quadratic speedup, effectively halving the key's security level in bits.\")\n    print(f\"To maintain a target security level of {target_security_level} bits against a quantum computer,\")\n    print(f\"the key length (N) must satisfy the equation: N / {grover_factor} = {target_security_level}.\")\n    print(f\"Therefore, the minimum required key length is {grover_factor} * {target_security_level} = {required_key_length} bits.\")\n\ncalculate_quantum_resistant_key_length()\n```\n<<<A>>>"
