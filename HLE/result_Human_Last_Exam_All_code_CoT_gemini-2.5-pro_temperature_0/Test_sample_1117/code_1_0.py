    explanation_part1 = (
        "The molecule Ce2@C80 is an endohedral fullerene, meaning two cerium (Ce) atoms are encapsulated within a C80 carbon cage.\n"
        "The reacting molecule, a disilirane, is very bulky. Due to its size, it cannot enter the fullerene cage.\n"
        "Therefore, the reaction is an 'exohedral addition', where the disilirane attaches to the outer surface of the C80 cage."
    )

    # Step 2: Analyze the effect of the reaction on the fullerene cage and the internal atoms.
    explanation_part2 = (
        "This addition of a large group to a single point on the fullerene's surface breaks the cage's high symmetry.\n"
        "This creates a new, defined molecular axis, with the point of attachment acting as one pole.\n"
        "The change in the cage's geometry and electronic structure alters the potential energy surface inside the cage."
    )

    # Step 3: Determine the final positions of the cerium atoms.
    explanation_part3 = (
        "The two cerium atoms, which could move freely in the symmetric unreacted cage, are now forced into fixed, stable positions.\n"
        "To achieve the lowest energy state, they align themselves along the new axis defined by the external group.\n"
        "This results in the cerium atoms being localized at the two opposite poles of the fullerene cage."

    conclusion = (
        "Based on this analysis:\n"
        "- A and B are incorrect because the reaction is external.\n"
        "- C is incorrect because the reaction ends the free random motion.\n"
        "- D is incorrect because the alignment is polar, not equatorial.\n"
