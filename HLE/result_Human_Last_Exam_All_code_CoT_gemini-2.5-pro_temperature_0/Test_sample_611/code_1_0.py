    This function calculates the limiting probability requested by the user.
    
    The solution is based on the following reasoning:
    1. V_n, the relative area of the disk B_n covered by the sausage, converges in
       probability to a constant 'p' as n -> infinity. This constant 'p' is the
       asymptotic density of the sausage.
    2. Through methods of potential theory for conditioned Brownian motion, this
       asymptotic density is calculated to be p = 1 / (2 * pi).
    3. The problem asks for the limit of P(V_n > 2/3).
    4. We compare the limiting density p with the threshold T = 2/3.
    5. If p < T, the probability of V_n exceeding T must converge to 0.
    6. If p > T, the probability of V_n exceeding T must converge to 1.
