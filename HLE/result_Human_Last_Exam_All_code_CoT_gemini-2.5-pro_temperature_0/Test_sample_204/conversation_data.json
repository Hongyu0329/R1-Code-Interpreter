    "To calculate the Hopf charge of the given vector field, we will use the Whitehead formula. For fields with the specific cylindrical symmetry present in this problem, the general 3D integral of the Whitehead formula can be simplified to a 2D integral over the `(ρ, z)` plane, where `ρ = sqrt(x² + y²)`.\n\nThe vector field is given by:\n`n = (sin(G)cos(f), sin(G)sin(f), cos(G))`\nwhere `f = atan2(y,x)` is the cylindrical angle `φ`, and `G` is a function of `ρ` and `z`:\n`G(ρ, z) = π * exp(-10 * sqrt((ρ² - 0.5)² + z²))`\n\nThe simplified formula for the Hopf charge `H` for this class of fields is:\n`H = - (1 / (2π)) * ∫[0 to ∞] dρ ∫[-∞ to ∞] dz [ (1 - cos(G(ρ,z))) * (∂G/∂ρ) ]`\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Define the function `G(ρ, z)` and its partial derivative with respect to `ρ`, `∂G/∂ρ`.\n2.  Create the integrand function, which is `(1 - cos(G)) * (∂G/∂ρ)`.\n3.  Use Python's `scipy.integrate.dblquad` function to numerically compute the 2D integral. The integration will be performed over `ρ` from 0 to infinity and `z` from negative infinity to positive infinity. In practice, the integrand decays very rapidly, so finite integration limits (e.g., `ρ` in `[0, 5]`, `z` in `[-5, 5]`) are sufficient for an accurate result.\n4.  Multiply the result of the integral by the prefactor `-1/(2π)` to obtain the final Hopf charge.\n5.  Print the intermediate and final results of the calculation. The result is expected to be an integer, as the Hopf charge is a topological invariant.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.integrate import dblquad\n\ndef calculate_hopf_charge():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Hopf charge for the given vector field using a \n    simplified 2D integral derived from the Whitehead formula.\n    \"\"\"\n    PI = np.pi\n\n    # Define the function G(rho, z)\n    def G(rho, z):\n        # To avoid division by zero or sqrt of negative numbers, handle small values\n        rho = max(rho, 1e-9)\n        r2_sq = (rho**2 - 0.5)**2 + z**2\n        if r2_sq < 1e-16:\n            # This is the center of the skyrmion ring, where G = pi\n            return PI\n        r2 = np.sqrt(r2_sq)\n        return PI * np.exp(-10.0 * r2)\n\n    # Define the partial derivative of G with respect to rho\n    def dG_drho(rho, z):\n        # By symmetry, the derivative is 0 on the z-axis (rho=0)\n        if rho < 1e-9:\n            return 0.0\n        \n        r2_sq = (rho**2 - 0.5)**2 + z**2\n        # Avoid division by zero at the singularity\n        if r2_sq < 1e-16:\n            # The integrand is handled separately at the singularity, \n            # but the derivative itself is undefined here.\n            # We return NaN and the integrand function will handle it.\n            return np.nan\n\n        r2 = np.sqrt(r2_sq)\n        exp_term = np.exp(-10.0 * r2)\n        \n        # Chain rule: dG/drho = dG/dr2 * dr2/drho\n        dG_dr2 = -10.0 * PI * exp_term\n        dr2_drho = (2.0 * rho * (rho**2 - 0.5)) / r2\n        \n        return dG_dr2 * dr2_drho\n\n    # Define the integrand for the double integral\n    # Note: dblquad expects the function signature func(y, x),\n    # so we map y -> z and x -> rho.\n    def integrand(z, rho):\n        # The integrand is singular at the point (rho=sqrt(0.5), z=0),\n        # but the singularity is integrable.
