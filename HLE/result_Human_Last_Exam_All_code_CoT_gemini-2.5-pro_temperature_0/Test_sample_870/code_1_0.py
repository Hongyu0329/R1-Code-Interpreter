# Define the four numbers for the puzzle
num1 = 10
num2 = 10
num3 = 4
num4 = 4

# The goal is to form an expression that equals 24.
# The solution is (10 * 10 - 4) / 4

# Calculate the result of the expression
result = (num1 * num2 - num3) / num4

# Print the final equation showing how the numbers are used.
# The problem asks to output each number in the final equation.
