# The problem is to find the Hausdorff dimension of a curve defined by:
# x(t) = sin(pi*t)
# y(t) = sin(t)
# z(t) = cos(2t)

# The Hausdorff dimension of a smooth curve is 1.
# A curve r(t) is smooth if its derivative vector r'(t) is continuous and never the zero vector.

# Let's define the parameter and the curve using sympy
t = sp.Symbol('t', real=True)
x = sp.sin(sp.pi * t)
y = sp.sin(t)
z = sp.cos(2*t)

# Step 1: Compute the derivative vector r'(t) = (x'(t), y'(t), z'(t))
dx_dt = sp.diff(x, t)
dy_dt = sp.diff(y, t)
dz_dt = sp.diff(z, t)

print("The components of the derivative vector r'(t) are:")
print(f"x'(t) = {dx_dt}")
print(f"y'(t) = {dy_dt}")
print(f"z'(t) = {dz_dt}")
print("-" * 40)

# Step 2: Check if the derivative vector can be the zero vector.
# This requires all components to be zero for the same value of t.
print("We check if r'(t) can be the zero vector [0, 0, 0].")
print("This requires all components to be zero simultaneously.")
print("\nCondition for x'(t) = 0:")
print(f"{dx_dt} = 0  =>  cos(pi*t) = 0")
print("This is true when t = n + 1/2, for any integer n.")

print("\nCondition for y'(t) = 0:")
print(f"{dy_dt} = 0  =>  cos(t) = 0")
print("This is true when t = m*pi + pi/2, for any integer m.")

print("\nFor both x'(t) and y'(t) to be zero, we would need:")
print("n + 1/2 = m*pi + pi/2")
print("n + 1/2 = pi * (m + 1/2)")
print("pi = (n + 1/2) / (m + 1/2)")
print("\nThis equation requires the irrational number pi to be a ratio of two rational numbers, which is impossible.")
print("Therefore, there is no value of t for which even the first two components of the derivative vector are simultaneously zero.")
print("This means the full derivative vector r'(t) can never be the zero vector.")
print("-" * 40)

# Step 3: Conclusion
print("The components of the derivative vector are continuous functions (sines and cosines), and the vector is never zero.")
print("Therefore, the curve is a smooth curve.")
print("The Hausdorff dimension of any smooth curve is 1.")
