# Step 1: Define the given weights.
# These are very large numbers, so we use Python's arbitrary-precision integers.
w13 = 10**400
w12 = 10**5

# Step 2: Derive the ratio tanh(c1)/tanh(c2).
# The solvability condition for the boundary value problem gives the equation:
# w12 * tanh(c1) + w13 * tanh(c2) = 0
# From this, we can find the ratio:
# tanh(c1) / tanh(c2) = -w13 / w12
# We perform integer division as the result is an integer.
ratio = -w13 // w12

# Step 3: Define the constants for the final expression.
# The expression to calculate is k * (ratio - subtrahend)**exponent
k = 1000
subtrahend = 1
exponent = 2

# Step 4: Calculate the final result.
# We use the calculated ratio and the defined constants.
result = k * (ratio - subtrahend)**exponent

# Step 5: Print the numbers from the final equation and the result.
# The final equation is: 1000 * ( (tanh(c1)/tanh(c2)) - 1 )**2
print(f"The equation to be solved is: {k} * ( (tanh(c1)/tanh(c2)) - {subtrahend} )**{exponent}")
