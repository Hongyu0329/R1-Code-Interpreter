    "To determine the length of the Second Great War in StarCraft lore, we need to find its start and end years.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Establish the Start Year:** The Second Great War begins with the events of the Brood War expansion, which starts in the year 2500.\n2.  **Establish the End Year:** The war concludes with the defeat of Amon at the end of the *Legacy of the Void* expansion, which takes place in the year 2506.\n3.  **Calculate the Duration:** Subtract the start year from the end year.\n4.  **Round Up:** Use Python's `math.ceil()` function to round the result up as requested, although in this case, the result is a whole number.\n5.  **Print the Equation:** Display the full calculation and the final rounded-up answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The Second Great War in StarCraft lore starts with the Brood War and ends with the conclusion of Legacy of the Void.\nstart_year = 2500\nend_year = 2506\n\n# Calculate the duration\nduration = end_year - start_year\n\n# Round the duration up to the nearest whole number\nrounded_duration = math.ceil(duration)\n\n# Print the explanation and the final equation\nprint(\"The Second Great War began in the year 2500 and concluded in 2506.\")\nprint(f\"Calculation: {end_year} - {start_year} = {duration}\")\nprint(f\"The total duration, rounded up, is {rounded_duration} years.\")\n```\n<<<6>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    How long was the Second Great War in StarCraft Lore (in years, rounded up)\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
