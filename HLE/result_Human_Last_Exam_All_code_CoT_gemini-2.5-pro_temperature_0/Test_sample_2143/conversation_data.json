    "My plan is to identify the person referred to as \"HE\" based on the provided clues.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Clues:** The prompt mentions \"HIS work,\" which contains a \"prohibition against representation\" and concludes with a rule about \"another's material possessions.\"\n2.  **Identify the \"Work\":** This description points directly to the Ten Commandments (the Decalogue).\n3.  **Identify the \"Prohibition\":** The \"prohibition against representation\" is the Second Commandment (\"You shall not make for yourself an idol...\").\n4.  **Identify the \"End of the Work\":** The rule about \"another's material possessions\" is the Tenth Commandment (\"You shall not covet your neighbor's house... or anything that belongs to your neighbor\"), which is the final commandment.\n5.  **Identify \"HE\":** The central human figure who, according to the biblical narrative (primarily in the Book of Exodus), received the Ten Commandments from God and delivered them to the people is Moses. The reference to Veronika Campan's interpretation points to a specific modern analysis of this ancient text, but the subject of the analysis remains the work attributed to Moses.\n6.  **Construct the Code:** I will write a simple Python script to print the full name.\n\n```python\ndef solve_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the riddle based on an analysis of the provided text.\n\n    The clues are:\n    1.  \"HIS work\": This refers to the Ten Commandments.\n    2.  \"prohibition against representation\": This is the Second Commandment.\n    3.  \"another's material possessions\" at the \"end of HIS work\": This is the Tenth Commandment (\"Thou shalt not covet...\").\n    4.  The person who received and wrote down the Ten Commandments is Moses.\n    \"\"\"\n    his_full_name = \"Moses\"\n    print(his_full_name)\n\nsolve_riddle()\n```\n<<<Moses>>>"
