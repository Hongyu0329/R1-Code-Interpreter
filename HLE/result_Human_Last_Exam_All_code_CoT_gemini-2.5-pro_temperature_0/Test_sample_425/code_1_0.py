    print("By Heesch's principle, the rotation group of the 3D object (A_4) must be a subgroup of the rotation group of the cylinder defined by the projection.")
    print("The rotation group of a cylinder with a circular base is O(2). The finite subgroups of O(2) are the cyclic groups (C_n) and dihedral groups (D_n).")
    print("A_4 is not a cyclic or dihedral group. For instance, A_4 has 8 elements of order 3, while no C_n or D_n group of order 12 has this property.")
