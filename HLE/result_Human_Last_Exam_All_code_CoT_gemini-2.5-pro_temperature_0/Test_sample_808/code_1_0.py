    Identifies which Platonic solids become non-planar after a specific modification.

    The problem describes the family of Platonic solids. We order them by their
    number of vertices to get their labels:
    1. Tetrahedron (V=4, k=3)
    2. Octahedron (V=6, k=3)
    3. Cube (V=8, k=4)
    4. Icosahedron (V=12, k=3)
    5. Dodecahedron (V=20, k=5)
    where k is the number of vertices on a face.

    The procedure is to take one face and add edges to make its vertices form a
    complete graph (K_k). We check which of the resulting graphs are non-planar.
