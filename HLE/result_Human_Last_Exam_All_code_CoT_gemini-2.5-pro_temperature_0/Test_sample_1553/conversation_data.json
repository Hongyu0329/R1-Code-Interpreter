    "Of course, I can help with that.\n\nThe user is asking for the name of a character from a novel. This is a factual question. I will find the name and then, as requested, present it within a Python script that prints the answer.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  Identify the main character of Jacek Dukaj's \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość\" (Perfect Imperfection), which is Adam Zamoyski.\n2.  Recall the plot points related to his significant relationships.\n3.  The character he forms the most profound bond with, akin to a marriage in the story's context, is an AI named Angelina.\n4.  Create a Python script that stores this name in a variable and then prints it in a descriptive sentence.\n\n```python\n# The main character of the novel \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość\" is Adam Zamoyski.\n# In the story, he forms a deep and complex partnership, which is the equivalent of a marriage,\n# with a powerful post-human entity.\n\n# The name of this character is stored in the variable below.\ncharacter_name = \"Angelina\"\n\nprint(f\"The character that the main character of 'Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość' marries is named: {character_name}\")\n```\n<<<Angelina>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What's the name of the character that the main character of Jacek Duke's novel \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonalość\" marries?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
