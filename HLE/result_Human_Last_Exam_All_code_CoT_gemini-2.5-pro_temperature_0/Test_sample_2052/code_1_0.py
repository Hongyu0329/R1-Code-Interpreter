  # Explanation for (a):
  # Superintegrability for the given two-matrix model with a potential term (1/n)Tr(Phi_2^n)
  # requires the potential V(Phi_1) to be a polynomial of degree at most n-2.
  # For n=3, V(Phi_1) must be at most quadratic.
  # The model Z_{-3}(t) is defined for a general potential V(Phi_1) = sum(t_k * Phi_1^k),
  # which is not restricted to be quadratic. Thus, superintegrability does not hold in general.

  # Explanation for (b):
  # The generation of Z_{-n}(t) is described by an algebra of operators (W-algebra).
  # This algebra is generated by the operators corresponding to n=2 and n=3.
  # The operator for n=4 can be expressed as a commutator of the n=2 and n=3 operators.
  # Therefore, the operator W_{-4} is not a new fundamental generator and is not considered "necessary".
