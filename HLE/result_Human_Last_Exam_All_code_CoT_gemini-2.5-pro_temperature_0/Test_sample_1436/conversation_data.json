    "To determine the symmetry factor of the described Feynman diagram, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the Diagram's Topology:** The description specifies a diagram with two vertices and four field contractions (which are internal lines or propagators). This means we have two points (vertices) connected to each other by four distinct lines. For this to be possible, each vertex must have four lines incident upon it, which corresponds to an interaction term like $\\phi^4$ in the Lagrangian. The resulting diagram is a vacuum bubble diagram.\n\n2.  **Understand the Symmetry Factor:** The symmetry factor, denoted by 'S', is a combinatorial number that corrects for overcounting when using Wick's theorem or summing diagrams. It is equal to the number of ways the elements of the diagram (vertices and lines) can be permuted without changing the diagram's overall structure.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Permutation Factors:**\n    *   **Vertex Permutations:** The two vertices are of the same type (both from the $\\phi^4$ interaction) and are connected symmetrically. Therefore, they are indistinguishable and can be swapped. This gives a permutation factor of 2! = 2.\n    *   **Line Permutations:** The four lines all connect the same two vertices, making them topologically identical. They can be permuted among themselves in 4! ways. This gives a permutation factor of 4! = 24.\n\n4.  **Compute the Total Symmetry Factor:** The total symmetry factor 'S' is the product of the factors from permuting the identical vertices and identical lines.\n\nThe Python code below will calculate this value and print the final equation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_symmetry_factor():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the symmetry factor for a Feynman diagram with two vertices\n    connected by four propagators.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The diagram has two identical vertices that can be swapped.\n    num_identical_vertices = 2\n    vertex_permutations = math.factorial(num_identical_vertices)\n\n    # The diagram has four identical lines connecting the two vertices.\n    # These lines can be permuted among themselves.\n    num_identical_lines = 4\n    line_permutations = math.factorial(num_identical_lines)\n\n    # The total symmetry factor is the product of the permutations of\n    # identical vertices and identical lines.\n    symmetry_factor = vertex_permutations * line_permutations\n\n    print(\"This Feynman diagram consists of two vertices connected by four internal lines.\")\n    print(\"The symmetry factor 'S' is the product of the number of permutations of its identical components.\")\n    print(f\"1.
