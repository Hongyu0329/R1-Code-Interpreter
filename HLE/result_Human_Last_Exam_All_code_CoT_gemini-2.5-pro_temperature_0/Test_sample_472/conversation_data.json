    "To scan the Latin line \"et tibi bene esse soli quom sibi sit male,\" we must determine the metrical length (long or short) of each syllable and group them into feet. This line is an iambic senarius, a common meter in Roman comedy, which consists of six iambic feet.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  **Syllabify the line**: Break the line into its constituent syllables.\n2.  **Handle Elisions and Contractions**: Plautine Latin often features elision (dropping a final vowel before an initial vowel) and other contractions.\n    *   `bene esse` elides to `ben' esse`.\n    *   A common Plautine feature is the shortening or dropping of a final short vowel before a consonant (apocope). Here, `sibi sit` is likely scanned as a contraction `sib' sit`.\n3.  **Determine Syllable Quantity**: Apply the rules of scansion to determine if each syllable is long (L) or short (S).\n    *   A syllable is long by position if its vowel is followed by two consonants.\n    *   A syllable is long by nature if it contains a long vowel or diphthong.\n    *   Plautus frequently uses \"iambic shortening,\" where a word with a short then long syllable (`S L`) is pronounced as two short syllables (`S S`). This applies to `tibi`.\n4.  **Group into Feet**: Assemble the syllables into six metrical feet. The base foot is an iamb (`S L`), but substitutions like a dactyl (`L S S`), spondee (`L L`), anapest (`S S L`), or pyrrhic (`S S`) are common.\n\nHere is the step-by-step scansion:\n\n*   **Line**: `et tibi bene esse soli quom sibi sit male`\n*   **Syllabification with contractions**: `et ti bi | be n'es | se so | li quom | sib' sit | ma le`\n*   **Analysis of Feet**:\n    1.  `et ti bi`: `et` is long by position (followed by 't' and 't'). `tibi` undergoes iambic shortening to `S S`. This forms a **dactyl** (`L S S`).\n    2.  `be n'es`: From the elided `ben' esse`. `be` is short. `n'es` is long by position (vowel 'e' followed by 'n' and 's'). This forms an **iamb** (`S L`).\n    3.  `se so`: `se` (from `esse`) is short. `so` (from `sōlī`) is long by nature. This forms an **iamb** (`S L`).\n    4.  `li quom`: `li` (from `sōlī`) is long by nature. `quom` is long by position. This forms a **spondee** (`L L`).\n    5.  `sib' sit`: From the contracted `sibi sit`. `sib'` is short. `sit` is long by position. This forms an **iamb** (`S L`).\n    6.  `ma le`: `ma` is short. `le` is short. This forms a **pyrrhic** (`S S`).\n\nThis results in the following scansion, with each foot separated by a space.\n\n```python\n# This script will print the scansion of the Latin line.\n# L represents a long syllable, S represents a short syllable.\n# Feet are separated by spaces.\n\nscansion = \"L S S S L S L L L S L S S\"\nprint(scansion)\n```\n<<<L S S S L S L L L S L S S>>>"
