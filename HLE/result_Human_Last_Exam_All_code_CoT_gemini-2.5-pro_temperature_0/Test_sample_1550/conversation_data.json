    "To find the number of real intersection points between the two given plane quadrics, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Define the Equations**: Let the two quadric equations be `Q1(x, y) = 0` and `Q2(x, y) = 0`.\n    *   `Q1: 164*x^2 - 216*x*y + 72*y^2 - 16*x + 31 = 0`\n    *   `Q2: 864*x^2 - 1056*x*y + 324*y^2 - 560*x + 324*y + 149 = 0`\n\n2.  **Simplify the System**: Solving this system directly is difficult. We'll look for a coordinate transformation to simplify the equations. By inspecting the quadratic part of `Q1`, `164*x^2 - 216*x*y + 72*y^2`, we can rewrite it as `2*x^2 + 18*(2*y - 3*x)^2`. This suggests the transformation:\n    *   `u = x`\n    *   `v = 2y - 3x`\n    The inverse transformation is `x = u` and `y = (v + 3u) / 2`.\n\n3.  **Transform the Equations**: We will substitute the inverse transformation into both `Q1` and `Q2`.\n    *   `Q1` transforms into a simple ellipse equation: `2*(u - 4)^2 + 18*v^2 = 1`.\n    *   `Q2` transforms into another, more complex, quadric equation in `u` and `v`.\n\n4.  **Solve the Transformed System**: We now have a system of two equations in `u` and `v`. We can solve this system algebraically.\n    *   By combining the two new equations, we can eliminate the quadratic terms (`u^2` and `v^2`) to obtain a simpler relation between `u` and `v`. This relation turns out to be a hyperbola: `v = (2*u - 9.5) / (162 - 42*u)`.\n    *   Substitute this expression for `v` back into the ellipse equation. This results in a single polynomial equation in the variable `u`.\n\n5.  **Find Real Solutions**: The resulting polynomial is of the 4th degree. We need to find its real roots.\n    *   For each real root `u`, we must check if it corresponds to a real intersection point. The ellipse equation `2*(u - 4)^2 + 18*v^2 = 1` only has real solutions for `v` if `2*(u - 4)^2 <= 1`. This gives a valid range for `u`.\n    *   The number of real roots of the polynomial that fall within this valid range is the number of real intersection points.\n\nThe following Python code implements this algebraic approach using the `sympy` library for symbolic manipulation and `numpy` to find the roots of the polynomial.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_quadric_intersections():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the number of real intersection points of two quadrics by using a\n    coordinate transformation to simplify the system and then solving it algebraically.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define symbolic variables\n    x, y, u, v = sp.symbols('x y u v')\n\n    # Define the two quadric equations from the user's prompt\n    Q1_expr = 164*x**2 - 216*x*y + 72*y**2 - 16*x + 31\n    Q2_expr = 864*x**2 - 1056*x*y + 324*y**2 - 560*x + 324*y + 149\n\n    # Define the inverse coordinate transformation: x = u, y = (v + 3u) / 2\n    transform = {x: u, y: (v + 3*u) / 2}\n\n    # Apply the transformation to the first equation and simplify\n    # This simplifies to 2*u**2 - 16*u + 18*v**2 + 31, which can be written as:\n    Q1_uv_std = 2*(u - 4)**2 + 18*v**2 - 1\n\n    # Apply the transformation to the second equation and simplify\n    Q2_uv = sp.simplify(Q2_expr.subs(transform))\n\n    # From the simplified Q1, we can express 18*v**2\n    # 18*v**2 = 1 - 2*(u - 4)**2\n    # We can use this to establish a simpler relationship between u and v from Q2\n    # The transformed Q2 is: 9*u**2 - 42*u*v - 74*u + 81*v**2 + 162*v + 149 = 0\n    # Substitute 81*v**2 = (9/2) * (1 - 2*(u-4)**2) into it.\n    # This leads to: -42*u*v - 2*u + 162*v + 9.5 = 0\n    # Solving for v gives:\n    v_in_terms_of_u = (2*u - 9.5) / (162 - 42*u)\n\n    # Substitute this expression for v back into the simplified ellipse equation\n    final_equation_in_u = Q1_uv_std.subs(v, v_in_terms_of_u)\n\n    # To solve final_equation_in_u = 0, we find the roots of its numerator\n    numerator_poly, denominator_poly = sp.fraction(sp.simplify(final_equation_in_u))\n\n    # To ensure integer coefficients for printing, we can clear the denominators (from 9.5)\n    # The expression for the numerator is:\n    # 72*(u-4)**2*(27-7*u)**2 + 18*(2*u-9.5)**2 - 36*(27-7*u)**2\n    # Multiplying by 4 clears the decimal from 9.5\n    final_poly_to_solve = sp.expand(numerator_poly * 4)\n\n    # Find the real roots of this polynomial\n    poly_coeffs = [float(c) for c in sp.Poly(final_poly_to_solve, u).all_coeffs()]\n    all_roots = np.roots(poly_coeffs)\n    real_roots_u = [r.real for r in all_roots if abs(r.imag) < 1e-9]\n\n    # For intersection points to be real, u must be in a specific range\n    # derived from 2*(u - 4)**2 <= 1\n    u_min = 4 - 1/np.sqrt(2)\n    u_max = 4 + 1/np.sqrt(2)\n\n    # Filter the roots to find those that correspond to real intersection points\n    valid_roots = sorted([r for r in real_roots_u if u_min <= r <= u_max])\n    \n    # The number of distinct valid roots gives the number of intersection points\n    # We use a tolerance to find distinct roots\n    distinct_valid_roots = []\n    if valid_roots:\n        distinct_valid_roots.append(valid_roots[0])\n        for i in range(1, len(valid_roots)):\n            if abs(valid_roots[i] - valid_roots[i-1]) > 1e-9:\n                distinct_valid_roots.append(valid_roots[i])\n\n    num_intersections = len(distinct_valid_roots)\n\n    # Print the explanation and the final polynomial equation\n    print(\"The system of two quadric equations is solved by a change of variables.\")\n    print(\"This simplifies the problem to finding the roots of a single polynomial.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe final polynomial equation in the variable u is:\")\n    \n    # Use sympy's pretty print to display the equation\n    final_poly_str = sp.pretty(sp.Poly(final_poly_to_solve, u), use_unicode=True)\n    print(f\"{final_poly_str} = 0\")\n    \n    print(f\"\\nThis is a 4th-degree polynomial.
