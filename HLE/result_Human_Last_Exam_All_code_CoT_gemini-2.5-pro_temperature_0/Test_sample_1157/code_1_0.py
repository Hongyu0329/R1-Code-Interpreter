    print("The patient's systemic condition is the top priority.")
    print("a) Medical Stabilization:")
    print(f"  - The HbA1c of {hba1c}% indicates uncontrolled diabetes, which severely impairs healing and increases infection risk.")
    print("  - Immediate consultation with an endocrinologist or general physician is required to start or adjust diabetes medication and stabilize blood glucose levels.")
    print("  - Prophylactic antibiotics are strongly indicated due to the traumatic injury, delayed presentation, and diabetic status.\n")
    print("b) Acute Dental & Trauma Management:")
    print(f"  - The 28-hour delay negates any possibility of tooth replantation.")
    print("  - Gently debride and irrigate the sockets (extraction sites) with saline or chlorhexidine.")
    print("  - Suture the soft tissues to control bleeding and promote primary healing.")
    print("  - A thorough clinical and radiographic (e.g., Periapical X-rays, CBCT) examination of the adjacent teeth and alveolar bone is necessary to assess for fractures or other damage.\n")

    # --- Step 2: Analysis of Key Clinical Findings ---
    print("### 2. ANALYSIS OF KEY CLINICAL FINDINGS ###\n")
    print(f"a) SNB Angle of {snb_angle}°:")
    print("  - A normal SNB angle is ~80°. An angle of 88° indicates a prognathic mandible (skeletal Class III relationship).")
    print("  - This significantly impacts the bite (occlusion) and must be a central consideration for any future prosthetic reconstruction.\n")
    print("b) Cells of Interest:")
    print("  - During the healing phase, key cells include:")
    print("    - Neutrophils & Macrophages: For initial wound cleaning and fighting infection (function may be impaired by diabetes).")
    print("    - Fibroblasts: For soft tissue repair and collagen synthesis.")
    print("    - Osteoblasts & Osteoclasts: For remodeling the alveolar bone at the site of tooth loss.\n")

    # --- Step 3: Definitive Prosthetic Management (After Stabilization) ---
    print("### 3. DEFINITIVE PROSTHETIC MANAGEMENT ###\n")
    print("This phase begins only after the patient is medically stable (improved glycemic control) and initial soft tissue healing is complete (typically 3-6 months).\n")
    print("Given the long span, loss of a key canine tooth, and skeletal discrepancy, a Removable Partial Denture (RPD) is a practical and appropriate choice.\n")
    print("a) Recommended Denture Type and Material:")
    print("  - Option 1 (Flexible): A flexible denture (e.g., Valplast). It offers good aesthetics and comfort, is less invasive, and can be a good long-term solution.")
    print("  - Option 2 (Rigid): A Cobalt-Chromium cast metal framework with acrylic teeth. This is more rigid, provides better support, and is more durable, which is beneficial given the Class III bite forces.\n")
    print("b) Abutment Teeth and Rationale:")
    print("  - Abutment Teeth: The left central incisor and the left second premolar.")
    print("  - Rationale: These are the teeth directly adjacent to the edentulous (toothless) space. They will be used to provide the essential support, stability, and retention for the partial denture by holding the clasps. Their periodontal health and structural integrity must be confirmed to be excellent before proceeding.\n")

    # --- Step 4: Clinical Data Equation ---
    print("### 4. CLINICAL COMPLEXITY EQUATION ###\n")
    print("To satisfy the prompt's request for an equation, we can represent the case's complexity by summarizing the key numerical data.")
    print("This is a conceptual representation, not a mathematical calculation.\n")
    print(f"Equation of Complexity: {lost_teeth_count} (lost teeth) + {delay_hours} (hours delay) + {hba1c} (HbA1c %) + {snb_angle} (SNB angle) = A highly complex clinical case requiring multi-disciplinary management.")
