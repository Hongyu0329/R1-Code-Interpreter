        "This is an absolutely essential step for completing DNA replication, particularly for joining the "

        "Step 2: Determine the consequence of a complete LIG1 knockout.\n"
        "A 'knockout' means the gene is completely inactivated. Because LIG1's role in DNA replication is "
        "fundamental and non-redundant in vertebrate cells, its absence is catastrophic. "
        "Cells cannot complete the replication of their genome, leading to cell cycle arrest and death. "

        "Somatic instability is a process that is observed over time in living, dividing cells. "
        "Since a LIG1 knockout is lethal to the cell or organism, it is not possible to measure any "
        "long-term effects on the stability of CTG repeats. The cells would not survive long enough "
