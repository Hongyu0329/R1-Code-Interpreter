    This function determines the smallest number of edges 'e' for a simple,
    connected graph with an automorphism group of size 3.

    The reasoning is as follows:
    1. The size of the automorphism group, |Aut(γ)|, is 3. This means the group
       must be the cyclic group C_3.
    2. Any non-trivial automorphism φ must have order 3.
    3. The set of edges is partitioned by the action of φ. For a simple graph,
       all edge orbits must have size 3. Thus, the number of edges 'e' must
       be a multiple of 3.
    4. We test the smallest multiples of 3:
       - e=3: Not possible. Connected graphs with 3 edges are P_4 (|Aut|=2) and
         K_1,3 (|Aut|=6).
       - e=6: Not possible. A systematic check shows that all candidate graphs
         have more than 3 automorphisms (e.g., |Aut|=6 or |Aut|=12).
       - e=9: This is possible. A graph with 9 vertices and 9 edges can be
         constructed to have exactly 3 automorphisms.

    Therefore, the smallest number of edges is 9.
