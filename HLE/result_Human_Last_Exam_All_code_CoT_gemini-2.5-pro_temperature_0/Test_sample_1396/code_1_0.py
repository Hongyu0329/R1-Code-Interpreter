# Set the number of agents
n = 4

# The state-of-the-art upper bound for query complexity is O(n * log(n) / epsilon).
# We calculate the n-dependent factor for n=4.
# We assume the logarithm is base 2, which is standard for complexities
# derived from algorithms involving binary search.
# The equation for this factor is: 4 * log2(4) = 8.

# Perform the calculation
log_base = 2
result = n * math.log(n, log_base)

# As requested, we output each number in the final equation.
