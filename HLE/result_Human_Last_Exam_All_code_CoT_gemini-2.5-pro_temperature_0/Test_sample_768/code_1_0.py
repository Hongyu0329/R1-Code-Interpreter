# First, let's define the constants and the integration limits.
# phi is the golden ratio.
phi = (1 + np.sqrt(5)) / 2
# The upper limit of integration is phi^3 - 1.
# We can use the property phi^2 = phi + 1 to simplify:
# phi^3 = phi * phi^2 = phi * (phi + 1) = phi^2 + phi = (phi + 1) + phi = 2*phi + 1
# So, phi^3 - 1 = 2*phi
upper_limit = 2 * phi

# Let's simplify the integrand.
# Let w = arctan(ln(cos(x/e))).
# For x in [0, 2*phi], x/e is in [0, 2*phi/e] approx [0, 1.19].
# In this range, cos(x/e) > 0, so ln(cos(x/e)) is real.
# Therefore, w is a real number.
# Let C = 1 + exp(w). Since w is real, C is a positive real number.
# The expression is Re[1 / C**i].
# C**i = exp(i * ln(C)) = cos(ln(C)) + i*sin(ln(C)).
# 1 / C**i = C**(-i) = exp(-i * ln(C)) = cos(ln(C)) - i*sin(ln(C)).
# The real part is cos(ln(C)).
# So the integrand simplifies to cos(ln(1 + exp(arctan(ln(cos(x/e)))))).
