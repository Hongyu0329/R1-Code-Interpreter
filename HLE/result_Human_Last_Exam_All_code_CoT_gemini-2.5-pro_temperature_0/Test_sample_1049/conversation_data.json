    "My plan to find the closed form for the given sum is as follows:\n\n1.  **Identify the structure of the sum.** The sum $S_n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n}((2k+1)^5\\binom{2k}{k}\\binom{2n-2k}{n-k})$ is a convolution of two sequences. Let $c_k = \\binom{2k}{k}$. The sum is the convolution of the sequence $a_k = (2k+1)^5 c_k$ with the sequence $b_k = c_k$.\n\n2.  **Use generating functions.** The coefficient of $x^n$ in the product of the generating functions for $a_k$ and $b_k$ will give the sum $S_n$.\n    *   The generating function for $b_k = c_k = \\binom{2k}{k}$ is a well-known result: $B(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\binom{2k}{k} x^k = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-4x}}$.\n    *   The generating function for $a_k = (2k+1)^5 c_k$ can be obtained by applying a differential operator to $B(x)$. Let $D = x \\frac{d}{dx}$. Then the generating function for $k \\cdot c_k$ is $D B(x)$. The generating function for $a_k$ is $A(x) = (2D+1)^5 B(x)$.\n\n3.  **Calculate the generating functions.** I will compute $A(x)$ by repeatedly applying the operator $(2D+1)$. This process reveals a pattern: applying the operator $(2D+1)$ to a function of the form $\\frac{P(x)}{(1-4x)^{m/2}}$ results in a function of the form $\\frac{Q(x)}{(1-4x)^{(m+2)/2}}$, where $P(x)$ and $Q(x)$ are polynomials.\n    After applying the operator five times, we find that $A(x) = \\frac{P_4(x)}{(1-4x)^{11/2}}$, where $P_4(x) = 4096x^4 + 20736x^3 + 8256x^2 + 464x + 1$.\n\n4.  **Find the generating function for the sum.** The generating function for the sum $S_n$ is the product $C(x) = A(x)B(x)$.\n    $C(x) = \\frac{4096x^4 + 20736x^3 + 8256x^2 + 464x + 1}{(1-4x)^{11/2}} \\cdot \\frac{1}{(1-4x)^{1/2}} = \\frac{P_4(x)}{(1-4x)^6}$.\n\n5.  **Extract the coefficient.** The sum $S_n$ is the coefficient of $x^n$ in the expansion of $C(x)$. We can find this by expanding $(1-4x)^{-6}$ and multiplying by the polynomial $P_4(x)$.\n    This results in an expression for $S_n$ which is $4^n$ times a polynomial in $n$ of degree 5.\n\n6.  **Simplify the expression.** To present the polynomial in a clean and structured way, I will express it in the basis of binomial coefficients, $\\binom{n}{k}$. This results in a form with integer coefficients.\n\n7.  **Final Code.** The Python code will print this final closed-form expression.\n\n```python\ndef print_closed_form():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function prints the derived closed form for the sum:\n    S_n = sum_{k=0 to n} (2k+1)^5 * C(2k, k) * C(2n-2k, n-k)\n    \n    The closed form is of the structure: 4^n * P(n),\n    where P(n) is a polynomial in n of degree 5.\n    We express P(n) in the basis of binomial coefficients C(n, k).\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The coefficients of the polynomial in the binomial basis C(n, k)\n    # for k from 5 down to 0 have been calculated.\n    coeffs = [973, 2681, 2578, 990, 121, 1]\n    \n    # Construct and print the formula string.\n    # The notation C(n, k) is used for the binomial coefficient \"n choose k\".\n    formula = (\n        f\"4**n * ({coeffs[0]}*C(n, 5) + {coeffs[1]}*C(n, 4) + \"\n        f\"{coeffs[2]}*C(n, 3) + {coeffs[3]}*C(n, 2) + \"\n        f\"{coeffs[4]}*C(n, 1) + {coeffs[5]}*C(n, 0))\"\n    )\n    \n    print(\"The closed form for the sum is:\")\n    print(formula)\n\nprint_closed_form()\n```\n<<<4**n * (973*C(n, 5) + 2681*C(n, 4) + 2578*C(n, 3) + 990*C(n, 2) + 121*C(n, 1) + 1*C(n, 0))>>>"
