    "To find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters $\\chi$ of conductor $d=53599$ and order 6, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Factorize the conductor $d$**: We first find the prime factorization of $d=53599$. This is crucial because the structure of the group of Dirichlet characters modulo $d$ depends on its prime factors.\n2.  **Analyze the character group**: For a square-free conductor $d = p_1 p_2 \\cdots p_k$, a Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $d$ can be uniquely written as a product $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\cdots \\chi_k$, where each $\\chi_i$ is a character modulo the prime factor $p_i$. The character $\\chi$ is primitive if and only if each of its components $\\chi_i$ is non-trivial (i.e., has an order greater than 1).\n3.  **Use the order condition**: The order of the character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its components. We are given that the order of $\\chi$ must be 6. This implies that the order of each component, $\\text{ord}(\\chi_i)$, must be a divisor of 6. Combining this with the primitivity condition, the possible orders for each component character are $\\{2, 3, 6\\}$.\n4.  **Count the valid combinations**: We will use a combinatorial approach based on the principle of inclusion-exclusion.\n    a. First, we count the total number of ways to form a character by choosing a component $\\chi_i$ for each prime factor $p_i$ such that its order is in $\\{2, 3, 6\\}$. The number of characters of a specific order $k$ modulo a prime $p$ is given by Euler's totient function, $\\phi(k)$, provided $k$ divides $p-1$.\n    b. From this total, we subtract the combinations where the lcm of the orders is not 6. This occurs if all component orders only have prime factors of 2 (i.e., all orders are 2), or only prime factors of 3 (i.e., all orders are 3).\n    c. The final result is the total number of combinations minus these excluded cases.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to calculate the final number.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef get_prime_factorization(n):\n    \"\"\"Returns the prime factorization of n as a dictionary.\"\"\"\n    factors = {}\n    d = 2\n    temp = n\n    while d * d <= temp:\n        while temp % d == 0:\n            factors[d] = factors.get(d, 0) + 1\n            temp //= d\n        d += 1\n    if temp > 1:\n        factors[temp] = factors.get(temp, 0) + 1\n    return factors\n\ndef phi(n):\n    \"\"\"Computes Euler's totient function.\"\"\"\n    result = n\n    p = 2\n    while p * p <= n:\n        if n % p == 0:\n            while n % p == 0:\n                n //= p\n            result -= result // p\n        p += 1\n    if n > 1:\n        result -= result // n\n    return result\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of a given conductor and order.\n    \"\"\"\n    d = 53599\n    g = 6\n\n    print(f\"Finding the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor d = {d} and order g = {g}.\")\n    \n    # Step 1: Factorize the conductor d.\n    prime_factors = get_prime_factorization(d)\n    primes = list(prime_factors.keys())\n    print(f\"Step 1: The prime factorization of d = {d} is {d} = {' * '.join(map(str, sorted(primes)))}.\")\n    \n    # Step 2: Analyze the structure and conditions.\n    # For a square-free conductor, primitivity means all components are non-trivial (order > 1).\n    # For the final order to be g=6, each component's order must divide 6.\n    # Thus, possible orders for each component are {2, 3, 6}.\n    print(\"Step 2: For the character to be primitive and of order 6, each of its components must have an order from the set {2, 3, 6}.\")\n\n    # Step 3: Count characters for each possible order using phi(k).\n    num_ord_2 = phi(2)\n    num_ord_3 = phi(3)\n    num_ord_6 = phi(6)\n    print(\"Step 3: The number of characters for each possible order is given by Euler's totient function:\")\n    print(f\"  - Number of characters of order 2: phi(2) = {num_ord_2}\")\n    print(f\"  - Number of characters of order 3: phi(3) = {num_ord_3}\")\n    print(f\"  - Number of characters of order 6: phi(6) = {num_ord_6}\")\n\n    # Step 4: Use inclusion-exclusion to find the final count.\n    num_components = len(primes)\n    choices_per_component = num_ord_2 + num_ord_3 + num_ord_6\n    total_combinations = choices_per_component ** num_components\n    \n    print(\"Step 4: We use the principle of inclusion-exclusion.\")\n    print(f\"The total number of ways to choose component characters with orders in {{2, 3, 6}} is:\")\n    print(f\"({num_ord_2} + {num_ord_3} + {num_ord_6})^{num_components} = {choices_per_component}^{num_components} = {total_combinations}\")\n\n    # Exclude cases where lcm is not 6.\n    # Case A: lcm divides 2 (all orders are 2).\n    excluded_lcm_div_2 = num_ord_2 ** num_components\n    print(\"We subtract cases where the lcm of orders is not 6.\")\n    print(f\" - Tuples where all orders are 2: {num_ord_2}^{num_components} = {excluded_lcm_div_2}\")\n\n    # Case B: lcm divides 3 (all orders are 3).\n    excluded_lcm_div_3 = num_ord_3 ** num_components\n    print(f\" - Tuples where all orders are 3: {num_ord_3}^{num_components} = {excluded_lcm_div_3}\")\n\n    # Final calculation\n    final_result = total_combinations - excluded_lcm_div_2 - excluded_lcm_div_3\n    print(\"The final number is the total minus the excluded sets.\")\n    print(f\"Final Equation: {total_combinations} - {excluded_lcm_div_2} - {excluded_lcm_div_3} = {final_result}\")\n    \n    print(f\"\\nThe number of primitive Dirichlet characters is {final_result}.\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<608>>>"
