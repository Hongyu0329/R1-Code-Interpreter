    # The set of n points, S = {P_1, P_2, ..., P_n}, are all equidistant from
    # point O. This means they all lie on a single circle.
    # A fundamental property of circles is that a single straight line can
    # intersect a circle at a maximum of two points.

    # The condition is that it's possible to get from any point in T to any other.
    # For a journey to start at a point, that point must lie on at least one of
    # the lines. Therefore, all n points from set S must lie on the union of the 9 lines.

    # Let's calculate the maximum possible number of points, n.
    # The total number of points 'n' is the number of points in the set S.
    # Since each of the 9 lines can contain at most 2 points from S, the total
    # number of points 'n' cannot exceed the sum of points on each line.
    # n <= (points on line 1) + (points on line 2) + ... + (points on line 9)
    # n <= 9 * 2
    # This gives us an upper bound for n.
    max_n = num_lines * max_points_from_circle_on_a_line

    # To confirm this is the maximum, we must show it's achievable.
    # Consider a configuration where all 9 lines pass through the center point O.
    # Each line is a diameter of the circle. Each line intersects the circle at 2 points.
    # This allows for 9 * 2 = 18 distinct points in S.
    # This configuration meets the connectivity rule:
    # 1. Any point P_i is on a line with O (1 line path).
    # 2. Any two points P_i and P_j on different lines (l_a and l_b) can be
    #    connected via the path P_i -> O -> P_j, which uses 2 lines.

    # Therefore, the maximum value of n is indeed the calculated upper bound.
    # The final equation is:
    print(f"The maximum value of n is calculated as:")
