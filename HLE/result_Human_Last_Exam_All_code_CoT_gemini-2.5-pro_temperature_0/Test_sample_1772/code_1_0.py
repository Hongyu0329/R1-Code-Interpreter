def solve_rational_subsets_equivalence():
    """
    Calculates the number of equivalence classes of subsets of the rational numbers.

    The equivalence relation is defined as A ~ B if A is homeomorphic to a subset of B
    and B is homeomorphic to a subset of A.

    The calculation is broken down as follows:
    1. Non-scattered subsets: All form a single equivalence class.
    2. Finite scattered subsets: Each cardinality n=0, 1, 2, ... forms a distinct class.
       This gives aleph_0 classes.
    3. Infinite scattered subsets: These form 2^aleph_0 (cardinality of the continuum) classes.

    The total number of classes is the sum of these cardinalities.
