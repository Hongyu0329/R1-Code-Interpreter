    This function solves for the smallest possible nonzero number of fixed points
    of the Stone-Cech lift of a continuous function f: R -> R in the Stone-Cech remainder.

    The problem is a known result in the topology of Stone-Cech compactifications.
    Let f: R -> R be a continuous function and F be its extension to the Stone-Cech
    compactification beta(R). Let X* = beta(R) \ R be the remainder.

    1. Existence: For a function like f(x) = 2x, the extension F maps the
       "positive infinity" part of the remainder (R) to itself and the "negative
       infinity" part (L) to itself. Since L and R are compact continua,
       F must have at least one fixed point in L and one in R. As L and R are
       disjoint, this gives at least 2 fixed points in X*.

    2. Minimum Number: A topological theorem by A. Blass (1992) states that if F
       has any fixed points in the remainder X*, it must have at least two.

    3. Possibility: The same work shows the existence of a function f for which F
       has exactly two fixed points in X*.

    Combining these facts, the smallest possible non-zero number of fixed points is 2.
