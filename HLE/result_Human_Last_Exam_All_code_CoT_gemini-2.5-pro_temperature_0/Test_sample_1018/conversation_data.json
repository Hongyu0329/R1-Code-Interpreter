    "To compute the simplicial volume of the product of two surfaces, $\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}$, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Recall the formula for the simplicial volume of a single surface.** For an oriented closed surface of genus $g \\ge 2$, denoted $\\Sigma_g$, its simplicial volume is given by the formula:\n    $\\|\\Sigma_g\\| = 2|\\chi(\\Sigma_g)| = 2(2g - 2) = 4g - 4$.\n    This formula applies because surfaces with genus $g \\ge 2$ are hyperbolic.\n\n2.  **Recall the product formula for simplicial volumes.** For two closed, oriented, hyperbolic manifolds, such as two surfaces $\\Sigma_g$ and $\\Sigma_h$ with $g, h \\ge 2$, the simplicial volume of their product is given by:\n    $\\|\\Sigma_g \\times \\Sigma_h\\| = \\binom{n+m}{n} \\|\\Sigma_g\\| \\|\\Sigma_h\\|$, where $n = m = 2$ are the dimensions of the surfaces.\n    The binomial coefficient is $\\binom{2+2}{2} = \\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 3}{2} = 6$.\n    So, the formula becomes $\\|\\Sigma_g \\times \\Sigma_h\\| = 6 \\|\\Sigma_g\\| \\|\\Sigma_h\\|$.\n\n3.  **Apply the formulas to the given genera.**\n    *   First, we calculate the simplicial volume for $\\Sigma_{31}$ (where $g=31$).\n    *   Second, we calculate the simplicial volume for $\\Sigma_{17}$ (where $h=17$).\n    *   Finally, we multiply these two values and the binomial coefficient to get the final result.\n\nThe following Python code will perform these calculations and print out each step of the process.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the genera of the surfaces\ng = 31\nh = 17\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the simplicial volume of the first surface, Sigma_g\n# The formula for the simplicial volume of a surface with genus g >= 2 is ||Sigma_g|| = 4*g - 4.\nsv_g = 4 * g - 4\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the simplicial volume of the second surface, Sigma_h\n# The formula for the simplicial volume of a surface with genus h >= 2 is ||Sigma_h|| = 4*h - 4.\nsv_h = 4 * h - 4\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the simplicial volume of the product Sigma_g x Sigma_h\n# The formula is ||Sigma_g x Sigma_h|| = C(4, 2) * ||Sigma_g|| * ||Sigma_h||\n# where C(4, 2) is the binomial coefficient \"4 choose 2\".\nn = 2  # Dimension of the surfaces\nm = 2\n# Using math.comb for binomial coefficient, which is C(n+m, n)\ncoeff = math.comb(n + m, n)\n\n# Calculate the final result\ntotal_sv = coeff * sv_g * sv_h\n\n# Print the step-by-step calculation\nprint(f\"The simplicial volume of an oriented closed surface of genus g >= 2 is given by the formula ||\\u03A3_g|| = 4g - 4.\")\nprint(f\"For g = {g}:\")\nprint(f\"||\\u03A3_{g}|| = 4 * {g} - 4 = {sv_g}\")\nprint(\"-\" * 20)\nprint(f\"For h = {h}:\")\nprint(f\"||\\u03A3_{h}|| = 4 * {h} - 4 = {sv_h}\")\nprint(\"-\" * 20)\nprint(f\"The simplicial volume of the product \\u03A3_{g} x \\u03A3_{h} is given by the formula:\")\nprint(f\"||\\u03A3_{g} x \\u03A3_{h}|| = C({n+m}, {n}) * ||\\u03A3_{g}|| * ||\\u03A3_{h}||\")\nprint(f\"where C({n+m}, {n}) = {coeff}.\")\nprint(\"The final calculation is:\")\nprint(f\"||\\u03A3_{g} x \\u03A3_{h}|| = {coeff} * {sv_g} * {sv_h} = {total_sv}\")\n```\n<<<46080>>>"
