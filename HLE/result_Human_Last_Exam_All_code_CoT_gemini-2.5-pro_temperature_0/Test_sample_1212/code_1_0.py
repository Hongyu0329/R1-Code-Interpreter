    Analyzes the Go puzzle to find White's killing move.

    The puzzle state is as follows:
    - Black stones: A2, B3, B4, C2, C1
    - White stones: B5, C3, C4, D1, D2, D5
    - It is White's turn to move.
    """

    # --- Strategic Analysis ---
    # The black stones are currently in three separate clusters: {C1, C2},
    # {B3, B4}, and {A2}. The point B2 is the vital connection point that
    # would unite all these stones into a single, large group.
    #
    # If Black gets to play at B2, the resulting group is strong enough to
    # create two eyes and live. Therefore, to kill the group, White's
    # critical move must be to occupy B2.

    # --- Move Verification ---
    # Let's analyze the sequence if White plays at B2.
    #
    # 1. White plays at B2:
    #    - This move successfully splits the black stones.
    #    - It also puts the black group {C1, C2} into 'atari' (a direct
    #      threat of capture), as its only remaining liberty is at B1.
    #
    # 2. Black's Response:
    #    - Black is now in a losing position. If Black tries to save the
    #      {C1, C2} group by playing at B1, White will play at A1, which
    #      captures the newly formed {B1, C1, C2} group.
    #    - If Black ignores the threat to {C1, C2} and tries to connect the
    #      other stones (e.g., by playing at A3), White will simply capture
    #      {C1, C2} by playing at B1.
    #
    # In all variations following White's move at B2, the separated black
    # groups do not have enough space or liberties to survive and are
    # eventually captured.

    # --- Analysis of Other Moves ---
    # If White plays any other move (e.g., A1, B1), Black will immediately
    # play at B2. This connects the black stones, and the resulting group
    # is too strong for White to kill.

    # --- Conclusion ---
    # The only move that initiates a guaranteed killing sequence for White is B2.
    killing_moves = ["B2"]

    # The final answer is the set of all possible killing moves.
    # The problem asks to output each move in the final set.
