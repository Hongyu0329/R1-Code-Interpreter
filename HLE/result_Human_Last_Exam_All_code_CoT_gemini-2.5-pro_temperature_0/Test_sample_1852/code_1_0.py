    # The infimum of the set of possible lengths of a tower is, by definition,
    # the tower number, denoted t(omega_1).

    # We are given 2^omega_1 = omega_2.
    # Substituting this into the inequality gives: omega_2 <= b(omega_1) <= omega_2.

    # From Step 1, we know that for any lambda in X, lambda >= delta_2 = omega_2.
    # Combining these, any lambda in X must be equal to omega_2.
    # Since omega_2 is a regular cardinal, the set X contains exactly one element.
