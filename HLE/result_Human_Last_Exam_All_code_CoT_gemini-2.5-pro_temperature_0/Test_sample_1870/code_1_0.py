    # The problem asks for the minimal length, delta, of a tower of uncountable
    # subsets of omega_1 that has no uncountable pseudo-intersection.

    # In set theory, this minimal length is a cardinal number. We need to determine
    # which cardinal it is.

    # 1. A lower bound for delta:
    # It can be proven in ZFC (the standard axioms of set theory) that any
    # tower of length omega_1 must have an uncountable pseudo-intersection.
    # This is shown using a diagonalization argument.
    # This means a tower of length omega_1 does not satisfy the required property.
    # Therefore, the length delta must be strictly greater than omega_1.
    # Since delta is a cardinal, the smallest cardinal greater than omega_1 is omega_2.
    # This gives us the lower bound: delta >= omega_2.

    # 2. An upper bound for delta:
    # It is also a theorem of ZFC that such a tower can be constructed. The standard
    # construction has a length equal to 2^(aleph_1), the number of all
    # uncountable subsets of omega_1.
    # This gives us the upper bound: delta <= 2^(aleph_1).

    # 3. Conclusion on the value of delta:
    # Combining these results, we have: omega_2 <= delta <= 2^(aleph_1).
    # A deep theorem by Saharon Shelah shows that, in fact, delta = 2^(aleph_1).

    # 4. Interpreting "minimal delta possible":
    # The value of 2^(aleph_1) is not determined by ZFC. For example, it is
    # consistent with ZFC that 2^(aleph_1) = omega_2 (the Generalized Continuum
    # Hypothesis at aleph_1), but it is also consistent that 2^(aleph_1) > omega_2.
    # The question asks for the "minimal delta possible". This is standardly
    # interpreted as the minimum value that delta can take in any model of ZFC.
    # From our lower bound, we know delta must be at least omega_2 in any model.
    # Since there are models of ZFC where delta is equal to omega_2, the minimal
    # possible value is indeed omega_2.

    # The final answer is the cardinal omega_2.
    # The number in this expression is 2.
    final_answer_index = 2
