    "To determine the number of isomers formed in the reaction, we need to analyze the stereochemistry of the product.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Product:** Determine the chemical structures of the reactants and predict the most likely product of the reaction.\n2.  **Analyze Product Structure:** The product is an octahedral coordination complex. We will identify its general formula type based on the ligands involved (e.g., `[M(AA)2(AB)]`).\n3.  **Identify Sources of Isomerism:** We will look for sources of stereoisomerism in the product complex. This includes chirality at the metal center and isomerism arising from the arrangement of unsymmetrical ligands.\n4.  **Calculate Total Isomers:** The total number of isomers is the product of the number of possibilities from each independent source of isomerism.\n\nThe following Python script executes this plan by printing the step-by-step chemical reasoning.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_isomer_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script explains the step-by-step reasoning to determine the number of\n    isomers formed in the given coordination chemistry reaction.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the reaction and the product\n    print(\"--- Step 1: The Reaction ---\")\n    reactant_complex = \"cis-dichlorobis(bipyridine)ruthenium(II), or cis-[Ru(bpy)2Cl2]\"\n    reactant_ligand = \"2,5-di(2-pyridyl)thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole, or dptzt\"\n    print(f\"The reaction involves '{reactant_complex}' and the ligand '{reactant_ligand}'.\")\n    print(\"This is a ligand substitution reaction where the two chloride (Cl-) ligands are replaced by one dptzt ligand.\")\n    product = \"[Ru(bpy)2(dptzt)]^2+\"\n    print(f\"The most likely product is the complex: {product}\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Analyze the product's structure\n    print(\"--- Step 2: Product Structure Analysis ---\")\n    print(f\"The product {product} is an octahedral complex with three bidentate ligands.\")\n    print(\" - Two ligands are bipyridine (bpy), which are symmetric chelating ligands (type AA).\")\n    print(\" - One ligand is dptzt, which chelates via one pyridyl nitrogen and one thiazole nitrogen.
