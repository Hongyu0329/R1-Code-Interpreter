def solve_violin_puzzle():
    """
    This function solves the violin acoustics puzzle by mapping physical variations
    to parameter groups in the given waveform model.

    The plan is as follows:
    1.  Analyze each variation and determine the primary physical change.
    2.  Map the physical change to one of the four parameter groups (i, ii, iii, iv).
    3.  For variation (2), determine the direction of change for the specified parameter.
    4.  Construct the final answer string in the format "group1,group2,group3,group4,direction".

    # Variation (1): 'sul ponticello' (bowing near the bridge) excites more high harmonics.
    # This changes the harmonic envelope, controlled by ν.
    # This corresponds to group ii.
    var1_group = "ii"

    # Variation (2): A bridge mute adds mass to the bridge, lowering the frequencies (f_m)
    # of the body resonances. The question asks about group iv (μ, a_2, f_2).
    # The last parameter, f_2, will decrease.
    var2_group = "iv"

    # Variation (3): Helium has a higher speed of sound than air, which increases the
    # frequencies (f_m) of the violin's body/air resonances.
    # This is a change in the resonance structure, represented by group iii (a_1, f_1).
    var3_group = "iii"

    # Variation (4): Playing on the E string instead of the A string changes the
    # fundamental frequency of the open string, F.
    # This corresponds to group i.
