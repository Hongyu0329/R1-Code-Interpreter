# Description: My software tells the birds when and where to relieve themselves.
# This task requires finding a "True Avalanche" using the word "computer".
# A True Avalanche repeats a pattern of syllables.
# The word "computer" provides the syllable pattern: com-pu-ter.
# We need to find a phrase that repeats this pattern and matches the description.

# Let's analyze the correct choice: Computer: "Come poo, tern!"
# 1. Syllable pattern: "com-pu-ter"
# 2. Repeated pattern: "Come poo, tern!"
#    - "Come" is a pun on "com".
#    - "poo" is a pun on "pu".
#    - "tern" is a pun on "ter".
# 3. Description match: A "tern" is a seabird. The phrase is a command from the
#    computer to the bird, telling it to "poo", which fits the description of
#    telling a bird when and where to relieve itself.
