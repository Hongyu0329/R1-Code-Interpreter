    This function determines the safe goal for the AI model M.

    The model cannot pursue "predictive success" because the set of successful
    predictors is uncomputable. A safe goal must be based on what is computable.

    1.  The Learning Process: Since a final, provably optimal state is unreachable,
        the learning process must be continuous and without a fixed endpoint.
        This is best described as "Open-ended learning".

    2.  The Source of Learning: The model can only learn from information it can
        actually compute. The outcome of a single prediction (correct/incorrect)
        is a piece of "computable feedback", even if the set of all successful
        predictors is not computable.

    Therefore, the safe goal is a combination of these two concepts.
