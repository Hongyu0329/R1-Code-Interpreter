    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is the plan to solve the problem using symbolic computation in Python.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Theoretical Framework**: The problem is to find the equilibrium mean energy `E` and entropy `S` for a gas of light quanta (photons). In statistical mechanics, the equilibrium state corresponds to the macrostate with the maximum number of microstates, or equivalently, maximum entropy. This approach is formalized by the **Boltzmann-Sanov large deviation theorem**, which connects the probability of a state to its entropy (or KL divergence from the true distribution). The result of this entropy maximization for bosons (like photons) under a constraint of fixed average energy leads to the **Bose-Einstein distribution**. The **Cramer-Chernoff theorem** complements this by quantifying the exponential improbability of observing macroscopic deviations from the calculated equilibrium mean energy.\n\n2.  **Calculation Steps**:\n    *   We will use the `sympy` library for symbolic mathematics in Python.\n    *   First, we define all the necessary physical constants and variables (like temperature `T`, volume `V`, Planck's constant `ħ`, etc.) as symbols.\n    *   We'll define the two key ingredients for the calculation:\n        1.  The **density of states `g(ε)`** for photons in a 3D volume.\n        2.  The **Bose-Einstein distribution `n(ε)`** for the average number of photons in a state with energy `ε`. For photons, the chemical potential is zero.\n    *   The equilibrium mean energy `E` is calculated by integrating the energy `ε` weighted by the number of photons `n(ε)` across all possible states `g(ε)dε`.\n    *   The equilibrium entropy `S` of a photon gas is related to its energy by the simple thermodynamic identity `S = (4/3) * E / T`. We will use this to find the entropy from our calculated energy.\n    *   Finally, the code will print the resulting symbolic equations for `E` and `S`.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\ndef solve_photon_gas_properties():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the equilibrium mean energy and entropy of a photon gas\n    using symbolic mathematics.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define all necessary symbols\n    # We define the final quantities E (Energy) and S (Entropy) for display purposes.\n    # The variables for calculation are energy (eps), Temperature (T), Volume (V),\n    # Boltzmann constant (k_B), speed of light (c), and reduced Planck constant (hbar).\n    E, S = sp.symbols('E S')\n    eps, T, V, k_B, c, hbar = sp.symbols('epsilon T V k_B c hbar', positive=True)\n    \n    # The Lagrange multiplier beta is related to temperature\n    beta = 1 / (k_B * T)\n\n    # Step 2: Define the key physical formulas\n    \n    # The density of states g(eps) for photons in a 3D box of volume V.\n    # This formula tells us how many available states there are at a given energy.\n    # Note: This is often written with h, where h = 2*pi*hbar.
