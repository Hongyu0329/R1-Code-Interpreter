# --- Given Parameters ---
E0 = 8.5  # Initial energy in MeV
R = 8.3   # Total range in cm
x = 4.0   # Distance from the source in cm

# --- Calculation ---
# Calculate the remaining range
R_remaining = R - x

# Calculate the magnitude of the energy loss per centimeter using the derived formula
# |dE/dx| = (2/3) * E0 * R^(-2/3) * (R - x)^(-1/3)
energy_loss = (2/3) * E0 * (R**(-2/3)) * (R_remaining**(-1/3))

# --- Output ---
