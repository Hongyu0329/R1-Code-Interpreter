# The task is to find the correct English translation for a Tzotzil sentence.
# Original Sentence: Oy `ox k`op ta batz`i k`op ta jna junabi.

# Analysis of the sentence components:
# Oy = "There was"
# 'ox k'op = "talk" or "conversation" (idiomatic use of 'ox, which means 3)
# ta = "in"
# batz'i k'op = "my native language" (literally "the true language")
# ta = "at"
# jna = "my house"
# junabi = "last year"

# Assembled Translation: "There was talk in my native language at my house last year."

# This translation matches option H.

# The instruction about an "equation" seems to be a template error for this type of question.
# I will fulfill the part about outputting the number from the sentence.
number_from_sentence = 3
word_for_number = "'ox"
chosen_answer = "H"
full_translation = "There was talk in my native language at my house last year."

print(f"The number in the original sentence is {word_for_number}, which means {number_from_sentence}.")
print(f"The full translation is: \"{full_translation}\"")
print(f"This corresponds to answer choice: {chosen_answer}")

<<<H>>>
