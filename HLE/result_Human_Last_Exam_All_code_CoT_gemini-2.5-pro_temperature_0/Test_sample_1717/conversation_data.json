    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my step-by-step plan to determine the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  First, I will establish the base health of the Eye of Cthulhu in single-player Expert Mode. This is our starting value.\n2.  Next, I will find the formula used by the game to scale boss health for additional players in Expert Mode. This is typically an additive percentage increase per player.\n3.  Then, I will construct the complete mathematical equation for the boss's health as a function of the number of players, `n`.\n4.  Finally, I will analyze this function as the number of players `n` approaches infinity. Since the health scaling is a linear function, it will increase without bound. This means the theoretical maximum health is infinite.\n5.  The Python code will define these values, print the final equation, and state the conclusion.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_eoc_health():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the base health for the Eye of Cthulhu in single-player Expert Mode.\n    # According to the official Terraria wiki, this value is 3640.\n    base_expert_health = 3640\n\n    # Step 2: Define the multiplayer health scaling factor.\n    # In Expert Mode, boss health increases by 35% for each player after the first.\n    per_player_increase = 0.35\n\n    # Step 3: Present the formula for health based on the number of players, 'n'.\n    # The formula is: Health = BaseHealth * (1 + PerPlayerIncrease * (n - 1))\n    print(\"The formula for the Eye of Cthulhu's health in Expert Mode for 'n' players is:\")\n    print(f\"Health(n) = {base_expert_health} * (1 + {per_player_increase} * (n - 1))\")\n    print(\"\\nThis can be simplified to the linear equation:\")\n    \n    # To simplify: Health(n) = 3640 * (1 + 0.35n - 0.35) = 3640 * (0.65 + 0.35n) = 2366 + 1274n\n    constant_part = base_expert_health * (1 - per_player_increase)\n    scaling_part = base_expert_health * per_player_increase\n    print(f\"Health(n) = {int(constant_part)} + {int(scaling_part)} * n\")\n\n    # Step 4: Analyze the formula for an infinite number of players.\n    # As 'n' (the number of players) approaches infinity, the term '1274 * n' also approaches infinity.\n    # A linear function with a positive slope increases without any upper bound.\n    print(\"\\nBecause the health scales linearly with the number of players, as the number of players approaches infinity, the health also increases without limit.\")\n    print(\"\\nTherefore, the theoretical maximum health is infinite.\")\n\ncalculate_eoc_health()\n```\n<<<infinity>>>"
