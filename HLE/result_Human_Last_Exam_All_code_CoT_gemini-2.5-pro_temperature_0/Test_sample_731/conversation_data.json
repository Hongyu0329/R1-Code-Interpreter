    "To find the number of power subgroups in the semidihedral group of size 512, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the Group:** The group in question is the semidihedral group of order 512. The semidihedral group of order $2^n$, denoted $SD_{2^n}$, has a specific structure. For size 512, we have $2^n = 512$, so $n=9$. We are dealing with $SD_{512}$.\n\n2.  **Understand \"Power Subgroup\":** A \"power subgroup\" is another name for a cyclic subgroup. It's a subgroup that can be generated by a single element of the group ($H = \\langle g \\rangle$ for some $g \\in G$). Our goal is to count the number of distinct cyclic subgroups in $SD_{512}$.\n\n3.  **Devise a Counting Strategy:** We can count the cyclic subgroups by analyzing the structure of $SD_{2^n}$. The group is generated by two elements, $r$ and $s$, with relations $r^{2^{n-1}} = s^2 = 1$ and $srs = r^{2^{n-2}-1}$. The elements of the group can be divided into three categories, which lead to distinct sets of cyclic subgroups:\n    *   **Type 1:** Subgroups generated by powers of $r$. These are all contained within the maximal cyclic subgroup $\\langle r \\rangle$ of order $2^{n-1} = 256$.\n    *   **Type 2:** Subgroups generated by elements of the form $sr^i$ where the exponent $i$ is an even number. These elements all have order 2.\n    *   **Type 3:** Subgroups generated by elements of the form $sr^i$ where the exponent $i$ is an odd number. These elements all have order 4.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Number of Subgroups for Each Type:**\n    *   **Type 1:** The number of subgroups in a cyclic group of order $2^{n-1}$ is the number of divisors of $2^{n-1}$, which is simply $(n-1)+1 = n$. For $n=9$, this is 9 subgroups.\n    *   **Type 2:** There are $2^{n-2}$ elements of the form $sr^i$ with $i$ even. Each of these generates a unique cyclic subgroup of order 2. For $n=9$, this is $2^{9-2} = 2^7 = 128$ subgroups.\n    *   **Type 3:** There are $2^{n-2}$ elements of the form $sr^i$ with $i$ odd. These elements of order 4 generate cyclic subgroups that come in pairs (i.e., two distinct elements generate the same subgroup). This results in $2^{n-2} / 2 = 2^{n-3}$ unique cyclic subgroups. For $n=9$, this is $2^{9-3} = 2^6 = 64$ subgroups.\n\n5.  **Sum the Counts:** The total number of power subgroups is the sum of the counts from these three disjoint sets of subgroups.\n\nThe following Python code implements this calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of power subgroups (cyclic subgroups) in the\n    semidihedral group of size 512.\n    \"\"\"\n    group_size = 512\n\n    # The semidihedral group SD_2^n has size 2^n.\n    # We find n for the given group size.\n    if group_size <= 0 or (group_size & (group_size - 1)) != 0:\n        print(f\"Error: Group size {group_size} is not a power of 2.\")\n        return\n\n    n = int(math.log2(group_size))\n\n    # The number of power subgroups (cyclic subgroups) in SD_2^n is the sum of:\n    # 1.
