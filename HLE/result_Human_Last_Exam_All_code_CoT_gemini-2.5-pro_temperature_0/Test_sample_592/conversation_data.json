    "My plan is to first identify the core question, which is a trivia question about the 1997 Italian film *Ovosodo*. I will find the answer by recalling the plot details of the movie. The character in question, Tommaso, is the protagonist's best friend who leaves their hometown of Livorno to pursue his dreams. I will determine the specific US city he moves to. Finally, I will write a simple Python script that stores this city name in a variable and then prints it to the console, fulfilling the user's request for a code-based solution.\n\n```python\ndef solve_movie_trivia():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides the answer to the trivia question about the movie Ovosodo.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The character Tommaso, played by Marco Cocci, moves to a specific US city to pursue a music career.\n    # Based on the movie's plot, that city is New York City.\n    us_city = \"New York City\"\n\n    print(f\"In the 1997 movie Ovosodo, the character Tommaso moves to: {us_city}\")\n\nsolve_movie_trivia()\n```\n<<<New York City>>>"
