    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve this riddle:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Clues:** I will break down the information provided in the prompt.\n    *   The person is described by Russian poet Andrei Voznesensky as \"a joy-discovering sailor.\"\n    *   Voznesensky's poem asks about the location of his grave, implying it was lost.\n    *   The location of the grave was discovered or became known in the late 1980s.\n\n2.  **Identify the Poem and Subject:** The famous lines are from Voznesensky's poem which formed the basis of the rock opera \"Juno and Avos.\" The central figure of this story is the Russian diplomat, explorer, and chamberlain, Nikolai Rezanov.\n\n3.  **Verify the Historical Facts:**\n    *   Nikolai Rezanov was a key figure in the Russian-American Company and led a major sea expedition, fitting the \"sailor\" description.\n    *   He died in Krasnoyarsk in 1807. His grave was at the Voskresensky Cathedral, which was destroyed in the 20th century, and the exact location of his burial was lost.\n    *   Interest in Rezanov surged with the popularity of the rock opera. In the late 1980s, a symbolic tombstone was placed in Krasnoyarsk at the presumed site of his grave, effectively \"answering\" the question from the poem.\n\n4.  **Formulate the Answer:** Based on these points, the man's last name is Rezanov. I will write a simple Python script to print this name.\n\n```python\n# The man described in the riddle is Nikolai Rezanov.\n# He was a Russian nobleman and statesman who promoted the project of Russian colonization of the Americas.\n# The poet Andrei Voznesensky wrote the poem \"Avos!\", which was adapted into the rock opera \"Juno and Avos\", romanticizing Rezanov's story.\n# Rezanov died in 1807 in Krasnoyarsk, and his grave was lost after the cathedral where he was buried was destroyed.\n# In the late 1980s, a memorial was erected at his presumed burial site.\n\nlast_name = \"Rezanov\"\nprint(last_name)\n```\n<<<Rezanov>>>"
