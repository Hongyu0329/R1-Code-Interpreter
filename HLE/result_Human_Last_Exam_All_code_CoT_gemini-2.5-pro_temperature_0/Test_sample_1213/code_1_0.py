def solve_go_puzzle():
    """
    This function analyzes the given Go puzzle and prints the solution.

    The board state is as follows:
    Black: A2, B3, B4, C2, C1
    White: B5, C3, C4, D1, D2, D5

      A B C D
    5 . O . O
    4 . X O .
    3 . X O .
    2 X . X O
    1 . . X O

    The black stones form a single group. To determine if White can kill this group,
    we must identify the group's liberties and see if White can fill them all.

    The liberties of the black group are the adjacent empty points:
    - A1 (adjacent to C1 and A2)
    - A3 (adjacent to A2 and B3)
    - A4 (adjacent to B4)
    - B1 (adjacent to C1)
    - B2 (adjacent to A2 and C2)

    The black shape is a "bulky five". This shape cannot make two eyes if White plays correctly.
    White can kill the group by playing on any of its five liberties. Let's analyze the general sequence:

    1. White plays on one of the liberties (e.g., A1).
    2. Black's best defensive move is to try and make an eye by playing on the vital point, B2.
    3. After Black plays at B2, the group has only three external liberties left (e.g., A3, A4, B1).
    4. White continues to play on these external liberties.
    5. Black will be put into atari (one liberty remaining) and will not be able to escape or form a second eye. The group will be captured.

    This logic applies if White starts on any of the five liberties (A1, A3, A4, B1, B2).
    Therefore, all five moves are valid starting points for a kill sequence.
    """
    # List of all moves for White that initiate a kill sequence.
    killing_moves = ["A1", "A3", "A4", "B1", "B2"]

    # Sort the moves alphanumerically as required.
    killing_moves.sort()

    # Format the output as a comma-separated string in curly brackets.
    result = "{" + ",".join(killing_moves) + "}"

    print(result)
