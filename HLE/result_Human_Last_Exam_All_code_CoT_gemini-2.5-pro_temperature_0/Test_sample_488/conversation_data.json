    "My plan to answer your question is as follows:\n1.  First, I will analyze the phrase \"my love for humanity\" to identify the underlying metaphorical concept at play.\n2.  Next, I will review the definitions of the different types of conceptual metaphors provided in the answer choices, based on the work of Lakoff and Johnson (\"Conceptual Metaphor in Everyday Language\" is a key chapter in their book \"Metaphors We Live By\").\n3.  I will then evaluate which category best describes the metaphor in the given phrase. The phrase treats \"love\" as a possession or a substance that one can have (\"my love\"). This points to a specific type of metaphor.\n4.  Finally, I will select the most accurate choice from the list and present the reasoning within a Python script, as requested.\n\n```python\ndef explain_metaphor_type():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the classification of the conceptual metaphor\n    in the phrase \"my love for humanity\".\n    \"\"\"\n    phrase = \"my love for humanity\"\n    \n    print(f\"Analyzing the phrase: '{phrase}'\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n    \n    # Step 1: Identify the underlying metaphor\n    print(\"Step 1: The core metaphorical concept.\")\n    print(\"The phrase treats 'love', which is an abstract emotion, as a tangible object or substance that can be possessed. The word 'my' indicates ownership.\")\n    print(\"This reveals the underlying metaphor: LOVE IS A POSSESSION.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n\n    # Step 2: Evaluate the options\n    print(\"Step 2: Evaluating the answer choices.\")\n    print(\"A. Conceptual metaphor: This is the name for the entire phenomenon, not a specific type. It is too general.\")\n    print(\"C. Orientational metaphor: This metaphor type organizes concepts spatially (e.g., UP/DOWN, IN/OUT). 'HAPPY IS UP' is an example. This does not apply here.\")\n    print(\"D. Structural metaphor: This type uses one well-understood concept to structure another, more abstract one. The metaphor LOVE IS A POSSESSION uses the concept of 'possession' to structure our understanding of 'love'. This is a perfect fit.\")\n    print(\"B and E are not standard classifications in the primary framework by Lakoff and Johnson.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n    \n    # Step 3: Conclusion\n    print(\"Conclusion:\")\n    print(\"Because the concept of LOVE is being structured by the concept of POSSESSION, the phrase expresses a structural metaphor.\")\n\nexplain_metaphor_type()\n```\n<<<D>>>"
