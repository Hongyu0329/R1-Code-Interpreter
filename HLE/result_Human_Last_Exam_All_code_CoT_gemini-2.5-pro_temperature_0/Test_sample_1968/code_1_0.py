### Detailed Explanation

The problem asks for which infinite cardinals $\kappa$ there exists a function $f : [\\kappa^+]^2 \\rightarrow \\kappa$ such that for every subset $x \\subseteq \\kappa^+$ with order type $\\text{otp}(x) = \\kappa+1$, the image of the pairs from $x$, denoted $f''([x]^2)$, has cardinality $\\kappa$.

The answer depends on whether the cardinal $\kappa$ is regular or singular.

#### Case 1: $\kappa$ is a regular cardinal.

For a regular cardinal $\kappa$, such a function **always exists**. We can construct one as follows:

1.  For each limit ordinal $\\beta < \\kappa^+$ with cofinality $\\text{cf}(\\beta) = \\kappa$, we fix a **club set** $C_\\beta \\subseteq \\beta$. A club set is a closed and unbounded subset of $\\beta$. We choose $C_\\beta$ to have order type $\\kappa$ and enumerate its elements as $C_\\beta = \\{\\gamma_\\xi : \\xi < \\kappa\\}$.

2.  We define the function $f(\\{\\alpha, \\beta\\})$ for $\\alpha < \\beta$ based on the cofinality of $\\beta$:
    *   If $\\text{cf}(\\beta) \\neq \\kappa$ (or if $\\beta$ is a successor), let $f(\\{\\alpha, \\beta\\}) = 0$.
    *   If $\\text{cf}(\\beta) = \\kappa$, we define $f(\\{\\alpha, \\beta\\}) = \\sup\\{\\xi < \\kappa : \\gamma_\\xi \\le \\alpha\\}$. This gives a value in $\\kappa$.

3.  Now, consider any set $x \\subseteq \\kappa^+$ with $\\text{otp}(x) = \\kappa+1$. Let $x = \\{x_\\eta : \\eta \\le \\kappa\\}$. The largest element is $\\beta = x_\\kappa = \\sup\\{x_\\eta : \\eta < \\kappa\\}$. Since $\\kappa$ is regular, the cofinality of $\\beta$ must be $\\kappa$.

4.  This means we use the second case of our function's definition for pairs involving $\\beta$. The set of values $\\{f(\\{x_\\eta, \\beta\\}) : \\eta < \\kappa\\}$ can be shown to be an unbounded subset of $\\kappa$, and thus has cardinality $\\kappa$. Therefore, $|f''([x]^2)| = \\kappa$.

#### Case 2: $\kappa$ is a singular cardinal.

For a singular cardinal $\kappa$, such a function **never exists**. This is a deep result from Saharon Shelah's PCF theory.

The relevant theorem states that for any singular cardinal $\\kappa$, the partition relation $\\kappa^+ \\rightarrow [\\kappa+1]^2_\\kappa$ holds.

This means that for **any** function $f : [\\kappa^+]^2 \\rightarrow \\kappa$, there is guaranteed to be a subset $x \\subseteq \\kappa^+$ with order type $\\kappa+1$ for which the image size $|f''([x]^2)|$ is **strictly less than** $\\kappa$.

This is the exact opposite of the property required by the question.

#### Conclusion

The existence of such a function is equivalent to the condition that $\\kappa$ is a regular cardinal.
