    print("   - Choice A (stapling the cecum) is too aggressive and creates a bigger, riskier operation.")
    print("   - Choice B (prying open laparoscopically) is very dangerous due to the high risk of tearing the bowel or blood vessels.")
    print("   - Choices E and F (making a new midline incision) are incorrect. The incision for an open appendectomy is in the right lower quadrant. Extending an existing port is the standard for conversion.")
    print("   - Choice C (extending the port just to pry) is an incomplete plan. The entire procedure needs to be completed safely.")
    print("   - Choice D (extending the port to complete an open appendectomy) is the safest and most definitive solution. It allows for direct control, safe removal of the failed instrument, and completion of the surgery under direct vision.")
