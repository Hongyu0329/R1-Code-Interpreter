    print("If you have a set of pieces that form a square, the number of distinct ways to assemble them is typically a divisor of 8 (i.e., 1, 2, 4, or 8).")

    print("This means the 5 assemblies cannot all be simple rotations/reflections of a single pattern.")

    print(f"To get {solutions_from_pattern_B} solution, the pattern must have 8 / {solutions_from_pattern_B} = 8 symmetries. This corresponds to a pattern that is fully symmetric, just like the square itself.")

    print("\nStep 5: Finding the Minimal Pieces (k)")

    print("Place the 2x2 square in a corner of the 4x4 grid. The four L-trominoes can tile the remaining L-shaped area. This pattern only has 180-degree rotational symmetry.")
