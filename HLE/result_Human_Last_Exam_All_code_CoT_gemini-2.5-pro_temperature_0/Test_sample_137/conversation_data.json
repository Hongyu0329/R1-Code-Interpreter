    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate a specific Hurwitz number, which counts certain types of branched covers of the Riemann sphere ($\\mathbb{P}^1$) by itself. The calculation involves two main steps:\n1.  **Apply the Riemann-Hurwitz formula** to confirm the genus of the covering space.\n2.  **Use the character formula of the symmetric group** to compute the number of such covers.\n\n### Step 1: Riemann-Hurwitz Formula\n\nFirst, we verify that the cover is indeed a map from $\\mathbb{P}^1$ to $\\mathbb{P}^1$. The genus of the covering curve, $g$, is given by the formula:\n$2g - 2 = d(2g' - 2) + \\sum_{i=1}^k (d - l(\\lambda_i))$\n\nHere:\n*   $d=7$ is the degree of the cover.\n*   $g'=0$ is the genus of the base space $\\mathbb{P}^1$.\n*   $k=4$ is the number of branch points.\n*   $\\lambda_i$ are the ramification profiles (partitions of $d=7$), and $l(\\lambda_i)$ is the number of parts in each partition.\n    *   $\\lambda_1 = (4,3) \\implies l(\\lambda_1) = 2$\n    *   $\\lambda_2 = (5,2) \\implies l(\\lambda_2) = 2$\n    *   $\\lambda_3 = (2,1,1,1,1,1) \\implies l(\\lambda_3) = 6$\n    *   $\\lambda_4 = (2,1,1,1,1,1) \\implies l(\\lambda_4) = 6$\n\nPlugging these values in:\n$2g - 2 = 7(2(0) - 2) + (7-2) + (7-2) + (7-6) + (7-6)$\n$2g - 2 = -14 + 5 + 5 + 1 + 1$\n$2g - 2 = -2$\n$2g = 0 \\implies g=0$.\nThis confirms the covering space has genus 0, so it is indeed $\\mathbb{P}^1$.\n\n### Step 2: Character Formula\n\nThe Hurwitz number for a genus 0 cover, $H_0$, can be calculated using the character theory of the symmetric group $S_d$. The formula is:\n$H_0(\\lambda_1, \\dots, \\lambda_k) = \\frac{1}{|\\text{Aut}|} \\frac{\\prod_{i=1}^k |C_{\\lambda_i}|}{d!} \\sum_{\\chi \\in \\text{Irr}(S_d)} \\frac{\\prod_{i=1}^k \\chi(\\lambda_i)}{\\chi(\\text{id})^{k-2}}$\n\nWhere:\n*   $|C_{\\lambda_i}|$ is the size of the conjugacy class in $S_d$ corresponding to the partition $\\lambda_i$.\n*   $|\\text{Aut}|$ is the size of the automorphism group of the tuple of ramification profiles. Since two profiles are identical, $|\\text{Aut}| = 2! = 2$.\n*   The sum is over all irreducible characters $\\chi$ of $S_d$.\n*   $\\chi(\\lambda_i)$ is the value of the character $\\chi$ on the conjugacy class $C_{\\lambda_i}$.\n*   $\\chi(\\text{id})$ is the dimension of the character $\\chi$.\n\nThe following Python code implements this formula to compute the Hurwitz number. It uses the `sympy` library to get the character table of $S_7$ and perform the calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\nfrom fractions import Fraction\nfrom sympy.combinatorics.permutations import Partition\nfrom sympy.combinatorics.symmetric import SymmetricGroup\nfrom sympy.combinatorics.group_numbers import conjugacy_class_size\n\ndef solve_hurwitz_number():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Hurwitz number for a degree 7 cover of P^1 with four specified branch points.\n    \"\"\"\n    d = 7\n    k = 4\n    \n    # Ramification profiles as partitions of d=7\n    p1 = Partition([4, 3])\n    p2 = Partition([5, 2])\n    p3 = Partition([2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1])\n    partitions = [p1, p2, p3, p3]\n\n    # The automorphism group size for the list of partitions.\n    # Two partitions are the same, so it's 2! = 2.\n    aut_factor = 2\n    \n    # Calculate sizes of the corresponding conjugacy classes in S_7\n    c1_size = conjugacy_class_size(p1)\n    c2_size = conjugacy_class_size(p2)\n    c3_size = conjugacy_class_size(p3)\n    \n    d_factorial = math.factorial(d)\n    \n    # Get the character table of the symmetric group S_7\n    S7 = SymmetricGroup(d)\n    char_table = S7.character_table()\n    \n    # Find the column indices for the required conjugacy classes\n    class_indices = {\n        p: char_table.conjugacy_classes.index(p) for p in set(partitions)\n    }\n    id_partition = Partition([1]*d)\n    id_class_idx = char_table.conjugacy_classes.index(id_partition)\n\n    # Sum over all irreducible characters of S_7\n    total_sum = 0\n    for i in range(len(char_table.conjugacy_classes)):\n        char_values = char_table[i]\n        \n        chi_id = char_values[id_class_idx]\n        chi_p1 = char_values[class_indices[p1]]\n        chi_p2 = char_values[class_indices[p2]]\n        chi_p3 = char_values[class_indices[p3]]\n        \n        # The formula term for this character\n        numerator = chi_p1 * chi_p2 * chi_p3**2\n        denominator = chi_id**(k - 2)\n        \n        total_sum += numerator / denominator\n\n    # Calculate the pre-factor for the formula\n    pre_factor_numerator = c1_size * c2_size * c3_size**2\n    pre_factor = pre_factor_numerator / d_factorial\n    \n    # Calculate the final Hurwitz number\n    hurwitz_number = (1 / aut_factor) * pre_factor * total_sum\n    \n    # The result must be an integer\n    final_result = round(hurwitz_number)\n\n    # Print the step-by-step calculation as requested\n    print(\"The Hurwitz number H is calculated using the formula:\")\n    print(\"H = (1/|Aut|) * (|C(4,3)| * |C(5,2)| * |C(2,1^5)|^2 / 7!) * Sum\")\n    print(\"\\nWhere Sum = sum over all irreducible characters chi of S7 of:\")\n    print(\"  (chi(C(4,3)) * chi(C(5,2)) * chi(C(2,1^5))^2) / chi(id)^2\\n\")\n    \n    # Use Fraction for a more precise representation of the sum\n    total_sum_fraction = Fraction(total_sum).limit_denominator()\n\n    print(\"Plugging in the numbers:\")\n    print(f\"H = (1/{aut_factor}) * ({c1_size} * {c2_size} * {c3_size}**2 / {d_factorial}) * {total_sum_fraction}\")\n    print(f\"H = {1/aut_factor} * ({pre_factor_numerator} / {d_factorial}) * {total_sum_fraction}\")\n    print(f\"H = {1/aut_factor} * {pre_factor} * {total_sum_fraction}\")\n    print(f\"H = {final_result}\")\n\nsolve_hurwitz_number()\n```\n<<<18522>>>"
