# Based on the analysis, the problem is structured in a way that implies the
# probability distributions of the determinants of matrices A and B are identical,
# i.e., P_det(A) = Q_det(B). If this were not the case, the function l(a)
# would depend on 'a', contradicting the request for a single "exact value".

# Let p(x) be the identical probability density function for both det(A) and det(B).
# The function l(a) is defined as:
# l(a) = log( integral( p(x)^a * p(x)^(1-a) dx ) )

# The expression inside the integral simplifies:
# p(x)^a * p(x)^(1-a) = p(x)^(a + 1 - a) = p(x)^1 = p(x)

# So the integral becomes the integral of the probability density function p(x)
# over its entire domain, which is always equal to 1.
# integral( p(x) dx ) = 1

# The value of the integral, a key number in the final calculation.
integral_value = 1

# Now, we can calculate l(a), which is the natural logarithm of the integral's value.
# l(a) = log(1)
final_answer = math.log(integral_value)

# The final equation is log(1) = 0.
# We print the numbers from this final calculation as requested.
print(f"The value of the integral is: {integral_value}")
print(f"The final result is the natural logarithm of the integral: log({integral_value}) = {final_answer}")

# The final exact value is 0.
