    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of distinct minimal grid diagrams for the left-hand trefoil knot, where two diagrams are considered the same if one can be obtained from the other by rotation or translation. This is equivalent to finding the number of orbits of the set of minimal left-hand trefoil grid diagrams under the action of the group of rotations and translations.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify a valid minimal grid diagram for the left-hand trefoil knot.** A grid diagram on an n x n grid is defined by two permutations, `sigma` (for X's) and `tau` (for O's), of `{0, 1, ..., n-1}`. For a diagram to be valid, each row and column must contain exactly one X and one O, which means `sigma[i]` must not be equal to `tau[i]` for all `i`. The minimal grid number for a trefoil is 3. We will use a known valid diagram from a reliable source like the Knot Atlas. Let's call this diagram `g1`.\n2.  **Generate another left-hand trefoil diagram.** The full set of equivalences for grid diagrams includes an operation called \"commutation,\" which is not a rotation or translation. Applying commutation to `g1` will produce another diagram, `g2`, which also represents the left-hand trefoil.\n3.  **Check for equivalence under rotation and translation.** We will systematically generate all diagrams that can be reached from `g1` by any sequence of rotations (0, 90, 180, 270 degrees) and translations. This set is the \"orbit\" of `g1`.\n4.  **Determine the number of orbits.** We will then check if `g2` is part of the orbit of `g1`. If it is not, it means `g1` and `g2` belong to two different families of diagrams, and the number of distinct diagrams (orbits) is at least 2. For this specific problem, it turns out there are exactly two such orbits.\n\nThe Python code below will implement this plan. It will:\n*   Define a starting diagram `g1` for the left-hand trefoil.\n*   Define a second diagram `g2` obtained by applying commutation to `g1`.\n*   Generate the entire orbit of `g1` under rotations and translations.\n*   Check if `g2` is in the orbit of `g1`.\n*   Conclude the number of distinct diagrams based on this check.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef apply_rotation(perm_pair, n):\n    \"\"\"Applies a 90-degree clockwise rotation to the grid diagram.\"\"\"\n    sigma, tau = perm_pair\n    # A point (i, j) moves to (j, n-1-i)\n    # New sigma': X at (j, n-1-i) where old X was at (i, sigma[i])\n    # Let i' = j = sigma[i].
