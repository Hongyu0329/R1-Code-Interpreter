    "To determine which condition of Arrhenius's sixth impossibility theorem is violated by critical-level views, let's first understand the core concepts.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  **Define Critical-Level Views:** In these views, the value of a population is calculated by summing up the welfare of each individual, but only after subtracting a certain \"critical level\" `c`. The value of adding a person with welfare `w` is `w - c`. This means adding a person with a positive welfare level can be bad if their welfare `w` is less than the critical level `c`.\n2.  **Define the Non-Elitism Condition:** This condition states that for any high level of welfare `w_high`, there is some number of people `n` at a low (but positive) welfare level `w_low` whose existence is better than the existence of one person at `w_high`. It essentially says that a large quantity of low-quality lives can outweigh a small quantity of high-quality lives.\n3.  **Demonstrate the Violation:** We will use a Python script to show that if we choose a low welfare level `w_low` that is below the critical level `c`, then no matter how many people `n` we add at that level, their collective value will always be negative and can never surpass the positive value of a single person with high welfare. This directly violates the Non-Elitism condition.\n\nThe following Python code will demonstrate this conflict.\n\n```python\ndef demonstrate_violation():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function demonstrates how critical-level views violate the Non-Elitism condition\n    of Arrhenius's impossibility theorem.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1. Define the parameters for our Critical-Level View example.\n    # Let's set a positive critical level.\n    critical_level = 10\n    print(f\"Let's assume a Critical-Level View where the critical level 'c' is {critical_level}.\")\n    print(\"According to this view, the value of a person with welfare 'w' is (w - c).\\n\")\n\n    # 2. Define the parameters for the Non-Elitism test.\n    # A single person with a very high quality of life.\n    w_high = 1000\n    # A group of people with a low, but positive, quality of life.\n    # CRUCIALLY, we choose a welfare level that is below the critical level.\n    w_low = 5\n    # Let's test for a large number of people.\n    n = 10000\n\n    print(\"Now, let's test the 'Non-Elitism' condition.\")\n    print(f\"Non-Elitism states that for a high welfare level (e.g., w_high = {w_high}),\")\n    print(f\"there must be some number 'n' of people at a low positive welfare level (e.g., w_low = {w_low})\")\n    print(\"such that the group of 'n' people is considered better than the single high-welfare person.\\n\")\n\n    # 3. Calculate the value of each population according to the critical-level view.\n    value_high_welfare_person = w_high - critical_level\n    value_low_welfare_group = n * (w_low - critical_level)\n\n    print(\"Let's calculate the values:\")\n    print(f\"Value of the single high-welfare person = w_high - c\")\n    print(f\"Value = {w_high} - {critical_level} = {value_high_welfare_person}\\n\")\n\n    print(f\"Value of the group of n={n} low-welfare people = n * (w_low - c)\")\n    print(f\"Value = {n} * ({w_low} - {critical_level}) = {n} * ({w_low - critical_level}) = {value_low_welfare_group}\\n\")\n\n    # 4. Check if the Non-Elitism condition holds.\n    # The condition is: value_low_welfare_group > value_high_welfare_person\n    print(\"The Non-Elitism condition requires that:\")\n    print(f\"Value of group > Value of single person\")\n    print(f\"{value_low_welfare_group} > {value_high_welfare_person}\\n\")\n\n    if value_low_welfare_group > value_high_welfare_person:\n        print(\"Conclusion: The condition holds.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Conclusion: The condition is VIOLATED.\")\n        print(f\"Because w_low ({w_low}) is less than the critical_level ({critical_level}), the term (w_low - c) is negative.\")\n        print(\"Therefore, as 'n' increases, the total value of the group becomes more negative and can never be greater than the positive value of the single high-welfare person.\")\n\ndemonstrate_violation()\n<<<C>>>\n```"
