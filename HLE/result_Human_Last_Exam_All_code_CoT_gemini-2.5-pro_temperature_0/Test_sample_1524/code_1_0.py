    # The core of the problem lies in the Bose-Einstein distribution function.
    # n(ε) = 1 / (exp((ε - μ) / (k_B * T)) - 1)
    # where:
    # n(ε) is the average occupation number of a state with energy ε
    # μ is the chemical potential
    # k_B is the Boltzmann constant
    # T is the temperature

    # A key physical principle is that the occupation number n(ε) must be non-negative.
    # For n(ε) >= 0, the denominator of the fraction must be positive.
    # exp((ε - μ) / (k_B * T)) - 1 > 0
    # This leads to: exp((ε - μ) / (k_B * T)) > 1

    # Taking the natural logarithm of both sides, we get:
    # (ε - μ) / (k_B * T) > 0

    # Since temperature T and k_B are positive, this simplifies to:
    # ε - μ > 0  or  μ < ε

    # This condition must hold for all possible energy states ε. The most restrictive
    # condition is for the lowest possible energy, the ground state energy ε_0.
    # Therefore, the chemical potential must be less than or equal to the ground state energy.
