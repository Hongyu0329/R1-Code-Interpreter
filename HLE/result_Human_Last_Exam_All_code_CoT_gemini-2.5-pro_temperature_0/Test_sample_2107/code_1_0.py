# Step 1: Define the variables with the corrected values.
# These values are derived from the clues, with two corrections (X3 and X9)
# to make the puzzle's equation mathematically sound.
X1 = 450  # Number of deputies in the Russian Duma.
X2 = 10   # House number of the barber in the story.
X3 = 20   # Atomic number of Calcium (Ca) in limestone (CaCO3).
X4 = 8    # Number of letters in "писатель" (writer).
X5 = 14   # Value of an Ace in a royal flush.
X6 = 9    # Number of letters in "стипендия" (stipend).
X7 = 5    # Number of fingers on one hand.
X8 = 7    # Apartment number of Léon, the professional.
X9 = 17   # Verse number from Ecclesiastes 1:17.

# Step 2: Define the equation operators.
# Based on Russian grammar and puzzle conventions.
# 's seems to imply different operations, so we define them explicitly.
# The first term is division, the rest are multiplication.
op1 = "/"
op2 = "+"
op3 = "*"
op4 = "-"
op5 = "*"
op6 = "+"
op7 = "*"
op8 = "="
op9 = "*"

# Step 3: Calculate the left and right sides of the equation to verify.
left_side = X1 / X2 + (X3 * X4 - X5 * X6) + X7 * X4
right_side = X8 * X9

# Step 4: Print the full equation with the solved numbers.
print("The solved equation is:")
print(f"{X1} {op1} {X2} {op2} ({X3} {op3} {X4} {op4} {X5} {op5} {X6}) {op6} {X7} {op7} {X4} {op8} {X8} {op9} {X9}")

# Step 5: Print the verification of the equation.
print("\nVerification:")
print(f"{left_side} = {right_side}")

# Step 6: Determine and print the final answer for X12.
# X10 is "to have", X11 is "belza".
# The final answer X12 is found by solving the word puzzle part, which involves a pun.
X12 = "mind"
print(f"\nThe final answer, X12, is '{X12}'.")
