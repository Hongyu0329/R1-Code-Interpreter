    # Step 1: Determine the maximum number of statements (n).
    # The tape limit is 366 characters.
    # A program consists of a number 'n' followed by 'n' statements of 3 characters each.
    # Let d be the number of digits in n.
    # Total characters = d + 3 * n.
    # We need to find the maximum n such that d + 3*n <= 366.
    # By testing values:
    # If n = 121, d = 3. Total chars = 3 + 3 * 121 = 3 + 363 = 366. This fits.
    # If n = 122, d = 3. Total chars = 3 + 3 * 122 = 3 + 366 = 369. This exceeds the limit.
    # So, the maximum value for n is 121.
    max_n = 121

    # Step 2: Determine the required variables and their minimum sizes in bytes.
    # The efficient C code needs three variables:
    # 1. 'n': To store the number of statements. Max value is 121.
    #    An 8-bit integer (int8_t, 1 byte) is sufficient (range -128 to 127 or 0 to 255).
    mem_n = 1  # bytes

    # 2. 'x': The accumulator. Its value will be in the range [-n, n], so [-121, 121].
    #    An 8-bit signed integer (int8_t, 1 byte) is sufficient.
    mem_x = 1  # bytes

    # 3. 'c': A buffer to hold one character read by getchar().
    #    A character is a 20x20 array of 1-byte pixels.
    #    Size = 20 * 20 * 1 byte/pixel.
    mem_c = 20 * 20 * 1  # bytes

    # The C code can use a `while(n-- > 0)` loop, avoiding a separate loop counter variable.

    # Step 3: Calculate the total memory.
    total_memory = mem_n + mem_x + mem_c

    # Step 4: Print the breakdown of the calculation.
