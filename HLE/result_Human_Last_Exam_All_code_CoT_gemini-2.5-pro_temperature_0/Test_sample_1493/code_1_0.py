    **Step 1: Analyzing the First Draft**
    The first draft is rich and descriptive. It establishes a harmony between the human-made arches and the natural world ("windows whisper shapes through to grass," "walls meet earth in a scuttle of insects"). The architect's presence is felt as a certainty ("echoes the art of an architect"). The observer feels "safe" and integrated into the scene, capturing a moment where past and present coexist. The overall tone is one of integration and stability.

    **Step 2: Analyzing the Fourth Draft**
    The fourth draft is stark, fragmented, and minimalist. It strips away most of the descriptive detail, leaving only "Stone," "moss," "glass," and "loss." The confident assertion of the architect's art is replaced with a doubtful question: "Was there an architect, once?" The sense of safety is gone, replaced by an "abyss of Past" and a feeling of searching for a lost answer. The tone is one of decay, uncertainty, and desolation.

    **Step 3: Comparing the Drafts to Find the Central Shift**
    The most significant change is the shift from a world of stable, meaningful order to one of decay and questioning. The first draft shows a human creation holding its own, its meaning intact. The fourth draft shows that same creation being overwhelmed by time and nature ("Moss. More moss, and stone."), its original purpose and creator now uncertain. This process of decay is a classic representation of entropyâ€”the tendency of order to break down into chaos over time.

    **Step 4: Evaluating the Answer Choices**
    *   A. Are remnants echoes of past architects? - This is part of the question, but too narrow. The first draft assumes 'yes', while the fourth asks the question. The *change* is about what happens to that echo over time.
    *   B. Can human-created order persist meaningfully against time's entropy? - This perfectly captures the core conflict introduced by the revision. The poem moves from a state of perceived order to a state of decay (entropy), forcing the reader to question if the original meaning can survive.
    *   C. Do our perceptions and memories shape our understanding of the world? - While true, this is not the central question highlighted by the *changes*. The focus shifts from the scene's harmony to its decay, a change in the external world more than the internal perception.
    *   D. Is there a God? - This is a possible metaphorical reading of "architect," but the poem's imagery is grounded in physical stone and moss. The most direct question is about human creation versus time.
    *   E. Should we think about the past as we capture aesthetically pleasing images? - This is a secondary theme. The core issue is the nature of the past itself (is it stable or lost?), not just how we photograph it.

    **Conclusion:**
    The revision from a full, integrated scene to a decaying, questioning fragment introduces the central metaphysical problem of order versus entropy. It asks whether the things we build and the meaning we imbue them with can possibly last.
