    # Plan:
    # 1. The problem is to find the number of homeomorphism classes of compact connected 
    #    metric spaces X with disconnection number D(X) = 4.
    # 2. We argue that such spaces must be finite graphs.
    # 3. For a graph G, the disconnection number is D(G) = m + 1, where m is the number 
    #    of edges in the graph after suppressing all vertices of degree 2.
    # 4. The problem requires D(X) = 4. Using the formula, we get the equation:
    #    4 = m + 1
    #    This implies m = 3.
    # 5. The task is now to count the number of non-homeomorphic connected graphs with 
    #    3 edges and no vertices of degree 2.
    # 6. This is equivalent to finding the number of valid degree sequences. The sum of 
    #    degrees must be 2 * m = 2 * 3 = 6. The degrees (parts of the partition of 6) 
    #    cannot be 2.
    # 7. We find all such partitions of 6 and confirm they correspond to unique connected graphs.
