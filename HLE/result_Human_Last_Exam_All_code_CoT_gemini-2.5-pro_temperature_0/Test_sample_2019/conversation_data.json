    "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of ways to place 4 queens on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard such that no two queens attack each other.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Understand Toroidal Attacks:** On a standard board, queens attack along the same row, column, and diagonals. On a toroidal (wrap-around) board, these attacks extend across the edges. For two queens at `(r1, c1)` and `(r2, c2)` on an `N x N` board, the attack conditions are:\n    *   **Row:** `r1 == r2`\n    *   **Column:** `c1 == c2`\n    *   **Diagonals:** This is equivalent to checking `(r1 - c1) % N == (r2 - c2) % N` and `(r1 + c1) % N == (r2 + c2) % N`.\n\n2.  **Choose an Algorithm:** The number of squares is small (25), so we can use a backtracking algorithm. This method systematically explores all possible placements, abandoning a path as soon as an attack is detected.\n\n3.  **Implement the Backtracking Algorithm:**\n    *   We'll write a recursive function that tries to place one queen at a time.\n    *   To avoid counting the same set of squares in a different order (permutations), we will process the board's 25 squares in a fixed order (e.g., from index 0 to 24). When placing a queen, we only consider squares with an index greater than the previously placed queen.\n    *   The main function will call a recursive helper, `_solve_recursive(k, start_index, placements)`, where `k` is the number of queens left to place, `start_index` is the starting square for the search, and `placements` is the list of current queen positions.\n    *   When `k` reaches 0, it means we have successfully placed all 4 queens, so we increment a solution counter.\n    *   Before placing a queen, we check if the new position is \"safe\" with respect to the queens already on the board using the toroidal attack rules.\n\n4.  **Final Output:** The script will execute the algorithm and print a sentence summarizing the problem and the final calculated number of ways, as requested.\n\n```python\nclass ToroidalQueensSolver:\n    \"\"\"\n    A solver to find the number of ways to place non-attacking queens\n    on a toroidal chessboard.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    def __init__(self, board_size, num_queens):\n        \"\"\"\n        Initializes the solver.\n        Args:\n            board_size (int): The size of the board (N for an NxN board).\n            num_queens (int): The number of queens to place.\n        \"\"\"\n        self.n = board_size\n        self.num_queens = num_queens\n        self.count = 0\n\n    def _is_safe(self, r, c, placements):\n        \"\"\"\n        Checks if placing a new queen at (r, c) is safe with respect\n        to the queens already in `placements`.\n        \"\"\"\n        for pr, pc in placements:\n            # Check for attacks on rows and columns\n            if r == pr or c == pc:\n                return False\n            # Check for attacks on toroidal diagonals\n            if (r - c) % self.n == (pr - pc) % self.n:\n                return False\n            if (r + c) % self.n == (pr + pc) % self.n:\n                return False\n        return True\n\n    def _solve_recursive(self, k, start_index, placements):\n        \"\"\"\n        The recursive backtracking function.\n        Args:\n            k (int): The number of queens remaining to be placed.\n            start_index (int): The board square index to start searching from.\n            placements (list): A list of (row, col) tuples for placed queens.\n        \"\"\"\n        # Base case: If all queens are placed, we found a valid solution.\n        if k == 0:\n            self.count += 1\n            return\n\n        # Optimization: If the number of remaining squares is less than the\n        # number of queens we still need to place, we can't succeed.\n        if (self.n * self.n - start_index) < k:\n            return\n\n        # Iterate through all possible squares starting from start_index.\n        for i in range(start_index, self.n * self.n):\n            r = i // self.n\n            c = i % self.n\n\n            # If the current square is safe, place a queen and recurse.\n            if self._is_safe(r, c, placements):\n                placements.append((r, c))\n                self._solve_recursive(k - 1, i + 1, placements)\n                placements.pop()  # Backtrack: remove the queen to try other paths.\n\n    def find_solutions(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        Starts the solving process and returns the total count of solutions.\n        \"\"\"\n        self._solve_recursive(self.num_queens, 0, [])\n        return self.count\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function to solve the problem and print the result.\n    \"\"\"\n    board_size = 5\n    num_queens = 4\n\n    solver = ToroidalQueensSolver(board_size, num_queens)\n    total_ways = solver.find_solutions()\n    \n    # The problem asks to output each number in the final equation.\n    # We will print a sentence that includes all the relevant numbers:\n    # the board size (5), the number of queens (4), and the result.\n    print(f\"On a {board_size}x{board_size} toroidal board, there are {total_ways} ways to place {num_queens} non-attacking queens.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n<<<200>>>"
