    "Here is a plan to determine the number of MLB Triple Crown winners:\n1.  First, I will define the two types of Triple Crowns in MLB: the Batting Triple Crown and the Pitching Triple Crown.\n2.  Next, I will create two separate lists in Python: one containing the names of all players who have won the Batting Triple Crown, and another for the Pitching Triple Crown winners. Note that some players have won multiple times, so their names will appear more than once in these initial lists.\n3.  To find the number of unique winners for each category, I will convert each list into a set, which automatically removes duplicates, and then count the number of elements in each set.\n4.  Finally, I will add the number of unique batting winners to the number of unique pitching winners to get the total number of players who have ever won a Triple Crown. The code will print this final calculation.\n\n```python\ndef count_triple_crown_winners():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates and prints the total number of unique MLB Triple Crown winners.\n    \"\"\"\n    # List of all instances of a player winning the Batting Triple Crown.\n    # Some players, like Rogers Hornsby and Ted Williams, won it more than once.\n    batting_winners_instances = [\n        \"Paul Hines\", \"Tip O'Neill\", \"Hugh Duffy\", \"Nap Lajoie\", \"Ty Cobb\",\n        \"Heinie Zimmerman\", \"Rogers Hornsby\", \"Rogers Hornsby\", \"Chuck Klein\",\n        \"Jimmie Foxx\", \"Lou Gehrig\", \"Joe Medwick\", \"Ted Williams\", \"Ted Williams\",\n        \"Mickey Mantle\", \"Frank Robinson\", \"Carl Yastrzemski\", \"Miguel Cabrera\"\n    ]\n\n    # List of all instances of a player winning the Pitching Triple Crown.\n    # Players like Walter Johnson, Sandy Koufax, and others won it multiple times.\n    pitching_winners_instances = [\n        \"Tommy Bond\", \"Old Hoss Radbourn\", \"Tim Keefe\", \"John Clarkson\", \"Amos Rusie\",\n        \"Cy Young\", \"Rube Waddell\", \"Christy Mathewson\", \"Christy Mathewson\",\n        \"Walter Johnson\", \"Pete Alexander\", \"Pete Alexander\", \"Walter Johnson\",\n        \"Pete Alexander\", \"Walter Johnson\", \"Dazzy Vance\", \"Lefty Grove\", \"Lefty Grove\",\n        \"Lefty Gomez\", \"Lefty Gomez\", \"Bucky Walters\", \"Bob Feller\", \"Hal Newhouser\",\n        \"Sandy Koufax\", \"Sandy Koufax\", \"Sandy Koufax\", \"Dwight Gooden\",\n        \"Roger Clemens\", \"Roger Clemens\", \"Pedro Martinez\", \"Randy Johnson\",\n        \"Johan Santana\", \"Clayton Kershaw\", \"Justin Verlander\", \"Shane Bieber\", \"Gerrit Cole\"\n    ]\n\n    # Use a set to get the count of unique players for each category\n    unique_batting_winners = set(batting_winners_instances)\n    num_unique_batting_winners = len(unique_batting_winners)\n\n    unique_pitching_winners = set(pitching_winners_instances)\n    num_unique_pitching_winners = len(unique_pitching_winners)\n\n    # Calculate the total number of unique winners\n    total_unique_winners = num_unique_batting_winners + num_unique_pitching_winners\n\n    print(\"To find the total number of MLB Triple Crown winners, we count the unique winners from both batting and pitching.\")\n    print(f\"Number of unique batting Triple Crown winners: {num_unique_batting_winners}\")\n    print(f\"Number of unique pitching Triple Crown winners: {num_unique_pitching_winners}\")\n    print(\"\\nFinal Calculation:\")\n    print(f\"{num_unique_batting_winners} + {num_unique_pitching_winners} = {total_unique_winners}\")\n\ncount_triple_crown_winners()\n```\n<<<42>>>"
