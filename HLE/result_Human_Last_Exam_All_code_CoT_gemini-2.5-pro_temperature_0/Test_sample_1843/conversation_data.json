    "To find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $N=36036$ and order 6, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Prime Factorization**: First, we find the prime factorization of the conductor $N$.\n    $N = 36036 = 2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7^1 \\cdot 11^1 \\cdot 13^1$.\n\n2.  **Character Decomposition**: A Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $N$ is primitive with conductor $N$ if and only if it can be uniquely decomposed into a product of primitive characters $\\chi = \\chi_{p_1^{a_1}} \\chi_{p_2^{a_2}} \\cdots \\chi_{p_k^{a_k}}$, where $N = p_1^{a_1} \\cdots p_k^{a_k}$ is the prime factorization of $N$. In our case, $\\chi = \\chi_4 \\chi_9 \\chi_7 \\chi_{11} \\chi_{13}$, where each $\\chi_{p^a}$ is a primitive character modulo $p^a$.\n\n3.  **Order of Characters**: The order of the character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters: $\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_4), \\text{ord}(\\chi_9), \\text{ord}(\\chi_7), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{11}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{13}))$. We require this lcm to be 6.\n\n4.  **Counting using Inclusion-Exclusion**: To find the number of characters with order exactly 6, we use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. The number of characters of order 6 is given by:\n    $C(6) = N(6) - N(3) - N(2) + N(1)$\n    where $N(d)$ is the number of primitive characters of conductor $N$ whose order divides $d$.\n\n5.  **Calculating N(d)**: The value of $N(d)$ is the product of the number of choices for each component character, i.e., $N(d) = N_4(d) \\cdot N_9(d) \\cdot N_7(d) \\cdot N_{11}(d) \\cdot N_{13}(d)$, where $N_{p^a}(d)$ is the number of primitive characters modulo $p^a$ whose order divides $d$.\n\n    -   For each prime power factor $p^a$ of $N$, we count the number of primitive characters whose order divides $d$ for $d \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 6\\}$.\n    -   We then multiply these counts for each $p^a$ to get the total $N(d)$.\n    -   Finally, we substitute these values into the inclusion-exclusion formula.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to calculate the final number.\n\n```python\nimport math\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef get_prime_factorization(n):\n    \"\"\"Computes the prime factorization of n.\"\"\"\n    factors = defaultdict(int)\n    d = 2\n    temp = n\n    while d * d <= temp:\n        while temp % d == 0:\n            factors[d] += 1\n            temp //= d\n        d += 1\n    if temp > 1:\n        factors[temp] += 1\n    return dict(factors)\n\ndef phi(n):\n    \"\"\"Computes Euler's totient function.\"\"\"\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    result = n\n    p = 2\n    temp = n\n    while p * p <= temp:\n        if temp % p == 0:\n            while temp % p == 0:\n                temp //= p\n            result -= result // p\n        p += 1\n    if temp > 1:\n        result -= result // temp\n    return result\n\ndef count_primitive_chars_order_divides(p, a, d):\n    \"\"\"\n    Counts the number of primitive characters mod p^a whose order divides d.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Case p=2\n    if p == 2:\n        if a == 1: # mod 2 has no primitive characters\n            return 0\n        if a == 2: # mod 4 has one primitive character of order 2\n            return 1 if 2 % d == 0 else 0\n        # For a >= 3, all primitive characters mod 2^a have order 2^(a-2)\n        order = 2**(a -
