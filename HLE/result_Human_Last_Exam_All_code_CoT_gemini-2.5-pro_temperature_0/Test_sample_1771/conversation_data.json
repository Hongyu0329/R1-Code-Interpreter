    "Of course. Here is the step-by-step derivation of the Proto-Indo-European form into its Germanic descendants.\n\nI will trace the etymological development of the Proto-Indo-European (PIE) form `*seh₂gieti` through several stages of the Germanic language family.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  **PIE to Proto-Germanic (PGmc):** I will apply Grimm's Law to the root consonant (`*g` > `*k`), account for the vowel changes caused by the laryngeal (`*eh₂` > `*ā` > `*ō`), and update the verbal ending to its PGmc equivalent for a Class 1 weak verb (`*-ieti` > `*-iþ`). This will result in the 3rd person singular form `*sōkiþ`.\n2.  **PGmc to Old Norse (ON):** From the PGmc form `*sōkiþ`, I will apply i-umlaut to the root vowel (`*ō` > `œ`) and the characteristic change of the verbal ending (`*-iþ` > `-ir`).\n3.  **PGmc to Old English (OE):** I will apply i-umlaut (`*ō` > `ē`) and palatalization (`*k` > `ċ`) to the root and update the verbal ending (`*-iþ` > `-eþ`).\n4.  **PGmc to Old High German (OHG):** I will apply the High German Consonant Shift to the root consonant (`*k` > `hh`), the characteristic vowel diphthongization (`*ō` > `uo`), and the change in the verbal ending (`*-iþ` > `-it`).\n5.  **Final Output:** The Python script will store these forms and print a step-by-step explanation, concluding with the full derivation chain showing each form.\n\n```python\ndef trace_etymology():\n    \"\"\"\n    Traces the PIE form *seh₂gieti through Germanic languages\n    and prints the derivation.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
