    "To answer this question, I will consult established paleontological research on the anatomy of *Irritator challengeri*. The plan is to find the specific description of the lacrimal bone in the scientific literature and extract the number of depressions mentioned within the lacrimal recess. This information will then be presented using a simple Python script.\n\nThe script will:\n1.  Store the number of depressions in a variable.\n2.  Print a sentence that clearly states the answer, incorporating the variable to show the result.\n\n```python\n# This script provides the answer to the question based on paleontological data.\n# The skull of Irritator challengeri, specifically the holotype specimen SMNS 58022,\n# has been described in detail in scientific papers.\n\n# According to the scientific literature (e.g., Sues et al., 2002),\n# the lacrimal recess on the side of the snout contains a specific number of depressions.\nnumber_of_depressions = 2\n\n# We print the final answer in a full sentence.\nprint(f\"The lacrimal recess in Irritator challengeri contains {number_of_depressions} depressions.\")\n```\n<<<2>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    How many depressions does the lacrimal recess in Irritator challengeri contain?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
