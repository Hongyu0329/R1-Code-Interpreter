    # The question asks for two pieces of information:
    # 1. The year of a shift in the French monarchy's stylization towards territoriality.
    #    - This refers to Philip II Augustus changing his title from "King of the Franks" to "King of France".
    #    - The key year for this event is 1190.
    # 2. The biographer who was the source for that monarch's epithet ("Augustus").
    #    - This was the chronicler Rigord.

    # The ideal answer would be (1190, Rigord), which is not an option.
    # We must evaluate the given choices.

    options = {
        'A': (1190, 'Suetonius'),
        'B': (1250, 'Joinville'),
        'C': (1223, 'Rigord'),
        'D': (1789, 'Voltaire'),
        'E': (1190, 'Baldwin')
    }

    # Analysis:
    # Option A has the correct year but a completely incorrect person (Roman historian).
    # Option E has the correct year but an incorrect person (modern historian, not the source).
    # Option C has the correct person (Rigord) but an imperfect year. 1223 is the year of Philip II's death,
    # which concluded the reign where the territorial transformation was cemented.
    # Given the choices, the specific and correct matching of the monarch's biographer (Rigord) in option C
    # makes it the most likely intended answer, despite the year being the end of the reign rather than the start of the event.
