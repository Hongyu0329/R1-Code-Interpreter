    Evaluating the options:
    - The combination of 'cold,' 'glass,' 'lace,' forming on plants, and being a temporary feature of Autumn strongly points to frost.
    - A spider's web is lace-like but isn't described as 'cold' or 'glass.'
    - The poem's subject is 'she,' while Autumn is a separate 'he' that destroys her creation.
    - The description is a metaphor, not a literal seamstress.

    The poem masterfully personifies frost, describing its delicate, crystalline patterns as if they were knitted lace, which is then destroyed by the full force of the Autumn season.
