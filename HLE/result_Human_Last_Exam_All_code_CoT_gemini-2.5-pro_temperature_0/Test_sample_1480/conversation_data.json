    "To calculate the rule activation level of an interval type-3 fuzzy set, we need to apply a t-norm operation to the antecedent firing level (`Phi_k(x′)`) and the consequent membership grade (`μG_k_j(y_j)`). A t-norm generalizes the logical AND operation. The most common t-norm is the minimum operator.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  Define variables for the given values: `Phi_k(x′) = 0.7` and `μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9`.\n2.  Apply the minimum t-norm to these two values.\n3.  Print the calculation and the final result.\n\n```python\n# Define the given values\nphi_k = 0.7\nmu_G_k_j = 0.9\n\n# The rule activation level is calculated using a t-norm operation.\n# We will use the most common t-norm, which is the minimum operator.\nactivation_level = min(phi_k, mu_G_k_j)\n\n# Print the final equation and the result\nprint(f\"The rule activation level is calculated using the minimum t-norm:\")\nprint(f\"Activation Level = min(Phi_k(x'), μG_k_j(y_j))\")\nprint(f\"Activation Level = min({phi_k}, {mu_G_k_j}) = {activation_level}\")\n```\n<<<0.7>>>"
