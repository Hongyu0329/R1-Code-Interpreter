The local magnetic field at the L1 point is generally not radial due to the Parker Spiral. For physically meaningful results, you must calculate helicity using the magnetic field components perpendicular to the local background magnetic field, which requires transforming the data into a Field-Aligned Coordinate (FAC) system.
