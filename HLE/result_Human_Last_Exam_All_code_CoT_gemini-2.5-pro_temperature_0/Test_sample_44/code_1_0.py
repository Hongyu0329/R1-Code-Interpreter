    # Explanation for the best-supported statement (F)
    print("Choice F states: 'It adopted an architectural style created for the self glorification of eastern dynasts, and the full and complete text of the Res Gestae Divi Augusti, the document describing Augustus' accomplishments and victories, was inscribed on it.'")
    print("\nThis statement has the most backing for two primary reasons:")
    print("1. Architectural Analysis: Scholars widely agree that the Mausoleum's massive circular tumulus form was influenced by the grand tombs of Hellenistic (Eastern) rulers, as well as earlier Etruscan traditions. This was a deliberate choice to position Augustus as a great dynastic founder.")
    print("2. The Res Gestae Inscription: This is a documented historical fact. In the introduction to the Res Gestae itself, it is stated that Augustus ordered a copy to be inscribed on two bronze pillars placed at the entrance to his Mausoleum. This text is the single most important document for understanding how Augustus wanted his reign to be remembered, making its placement at his tomb fundamentally important to the structure's meaning.")

    print("\nConclusion: Choice F combines a core architectural analysis with an undisputed fact about the monument's most significant textual element, making it the most comprehensive and well-supported statement.")
