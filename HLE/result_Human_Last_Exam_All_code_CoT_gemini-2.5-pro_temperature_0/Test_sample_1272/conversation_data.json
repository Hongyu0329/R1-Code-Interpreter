    "Here is a plan to identify the location of Ming General Mu Sheng's first major defeat in Vietnam.\n\n1.  **Identify the Historical Event**: The question refers to a specific battle during the Lam Sơn uprising (1418–1427), led by Lê Lợi against the occupying Ming forces in Vietnam.\n2.  **Pinpoint the Battle**: The first catastrophic defeat for the Ming army during this conflict was the Battle of Tốt Động – Chúc Động, which took place in late 1426. Although the Ming forces were under the direct field command of General Wang Tong (王通), it represented a major strategic defeat for the overall Ming campaign in the region.\n3.  **Locate the Battlefield**: The battle occurred at Tốt Động and Chúc Động.\n4.  **Find the Modern Location**: These historical sites are located in what is now the Chương Mỹ District.\n5.  **Identify the Current Province**: The Chương Mỹ District is an administrative unit of the city of Hanoi, which is a municipality with the same status as a province in Vietnam.\n\nThe following Python code will print out the name of the modern-day province.\n\n```python\ndef find_location_of_defeat():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the current Vietnamese province\n    where Ming General Mu Sheng's forces experienced their first major defeat\n    during the Lam Sơn uprising.\n    \"\"\"\n    battle = \"Battle of Tốt Động – Chúc Động\"\n    year = 1426\n    historical_location = \"Tốt Động and Chúc Động, Chương Mỹ District\"\n    modern_province = \"Hanoi\"\n\n    print(f\"The first major defeat for the Ming army during the Lam Sơn uprising was the {battle} in {year}.\")\n    print(f\"The battle took place at {historical_location}.\")\n    print(f\"Today, this area is part of the city of {modern_province}, which is a province-level municipality in Vietnam.\")\n    print(\"\\nTherefore, the current Vietnamese province is:\")\n    print(modern_province)\n\nfind_location_of_defeat()\n```\n<<<Hanoi>>>"
