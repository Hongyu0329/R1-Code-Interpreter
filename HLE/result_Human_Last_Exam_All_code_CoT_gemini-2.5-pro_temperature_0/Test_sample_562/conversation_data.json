    "My plan is to first identify the components of the Japanese character 謄. Then, I will determine which component is the radical (bushu). Finally, I will find the Hepburn romanization for the name of that radical and write a Python script to print the answer.\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the character**: The character 謄 can be broken down into two parts: the left side component `月` and the right side component `朕`.\n2.  **Identify the radical**: In this structure, the left-side component `月` is the radical. This specific radical is a variant of `肉` (niku), meaning \"meat\" or \"flesh\", and is called `にくづき` (nikuzuki). When a radical appears on the left side of a character, it is called a `へん` (hen).\n3.  **Determine the Hepburn name**: Combining the name of the radical (`Nikuzuki`) and its position (`hen`), the full name is `Nikuzukihen`.\n4.  **Create the script**: The Python script will store this information and print it out clearly.\n\n```python\ndef find_radical_name():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the radical for the kanji 謄 and prints its name\n    in Hepburn romanization.\n    \"\"\"\n    kanji = \"謄\"\n    # The radical for 謄 is 月, which is a variant of 肉 (niku, meat).\n    # When it appears on the left side (hen), it is called Nikuzukihen.\n    radical_name_hepburn = \"Nikuzukihen\"\n\n    print(f\"The radical (bushu) in the character '{kanji}' is '月'.\")\n    print(\"This is the 'nikuzuki' variant, derived from the character for meat (肉).\")\n    print(\"When it appears on the left side of a character, it is called a 'hen'.\")\n    print(f\"The Hepburn transcription for the radical's name is: {radical_name_hepburn}\")\n\nfind_radical_name()\n```\n<<<Nikuzukihen>>>"
