# This script calculates the answers to the questions about tropical moduli spaces
# and prints the results in the required format.

# Step 1: Define the numerical constants found in the expressions for the answers.
# For part (a), the minimum number of vertices is 1.
num_a = 1

# For part (c), the dimension is 3g - 3 + |A|. The numbers are 3 and -3.
num_c_coeff = 3
num_c_const = -3

# Step 2: Fulfill the requirement to output each number from the final equations.
print("The numerical constants found in the answer expressions are:")
print(f"From expression (a): {num_a}")
print(f"From expression (c): {num_c_coeff}, {num_c_const}")
print("-" * 30)

# Step 3: Construct the final answer string using these numbers and other components.
# Part (a) answer is the number itself.
ans_a = str(num_a)

# Part (b) answer is a 'yes' or 'no'.
ans_b = "yes"

# Part (c) answer has two components.
ans_c1 = "yes"
# Build the expression string from the numbers for clarity.
ans_c2 = f"{num_c_coeff}g - 3 + |A|"

# Combine all parts into the final required format.
final_answer_string = f"(a) {ans_a}; (b) {ans_b}; (c) {ans_c1}, {ans_c2}"

# Step 4: Print the final formatted answer.
print("The final formatted answer is:")
print(final_answer_string)
