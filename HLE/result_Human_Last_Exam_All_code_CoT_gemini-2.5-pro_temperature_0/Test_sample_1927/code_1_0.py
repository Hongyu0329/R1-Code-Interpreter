# Plan:
# 1. The root node is required to start the countermodel.
# 2. Falsifying the formula at the root forces the creation of a first level of successors.
#    This is because we need to falsify P1 = (A1 -> B1) v (~A1 -> B1), which requires two branches.
# 3. The conditions on the root propagate to the first-level successors, forcing them to falsify P0.
#    Falsifying P0 = (A0 -> B0) v (~A0 -> B0) at each of the two successors requires two new branches for each.
# 4. This creates a second level of successors.
# 5. The total number of nodes is the sum of nodes at all levels.

root_node = 1
level_1_nodes = 2
level_2_nodes = 2 * level_1_nodes # Each of the 2 nodes at level 1 needs 2 successors

total_nodes = root_node + level_1_nodes + level_2_nodes
