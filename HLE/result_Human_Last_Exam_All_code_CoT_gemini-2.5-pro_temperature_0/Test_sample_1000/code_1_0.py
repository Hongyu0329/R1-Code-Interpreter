    Solves the linear algebra problem about subspaces.

    Let n be the dimension of the ambient vector space V_0.
    Let d be the dimension of the subspaces in the set X.
    The problem is to find the smallest size k of a subset Y of X such that
    for any V in X, the sum of intersections of V with all W in Y equals V.

    This problem can be solved by transforming it into its dual form.
    Let n = 2023 and d = 2000.
    The dual subspaces V' and W' have dimension d' = n - d.
    d' = 2023 - 2000 = 23.

    The dual problem is to find the smallest k such that there exists a set
    of k d'-dimensional subspaces {W'_1, ..., W'_k} for which for any
    d'-dimensional subspace V', the following holds:
    Intersection(V' + W'_i for i=1..k) = V'

    A counterexample to this condition would be a subspace V' and a vector x not in V'
    such that x is in (V' + W'_i) for all i.
    This implies that all W'_i must be subspaces of a common (d'+1)-dimensional space H.

    To prevent a counterexample, we must choose the W'_i subspaces such that they
    do not all lie in a common (d'+1)-dimensional space.

    Lower Bound: If k <= d', one can construct a counterexample.
    Let k = d' = 23.
    Consider a (d'+1)-dimensional space H (dim 24). Let {e_1, ..., e_{24}} be its basis.
    Choose W'_i = span(H without e_i) for i=1..23.
    Choose V' = span(H without e_{24}).
    This construction fails the condition, so k must be at least d' + 1.

    Upper Bound: If k = d' + 1 = 24, we can choose the W'_i subspaces to be
    sufficiently "independent" such that their span is larger than d'+1.
    For example, choose them such that their sum is a direct sum.
    The dimension of their span would be k * d' = 24 * 23 = 552.
    Since 552 > 24, they cannot all lie in a 24-dimensional subspace H.
    Thus, no counterexample can be constructed.

    So, the minimum value for k is d' + 1.
