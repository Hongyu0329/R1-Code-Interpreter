    "My plan to answer your question is as follows:\n1.  I will first identify the film based on the specific scene you described.\n2.  The scene involves a protagonist on the run who boards a bus. A law enforcement officer checks on him but moves on. The protagonist, out of habit or to seem normal, says \"Thank you,\" which makes the officer turn back and recognize him, forcing him to flee again.\n3.  This memorable scene is from the 1993 film *The Fugitive*, which was nominated for seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture.\n4.  I will then write a Python script that prints the name of this film as the answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_movie_by_scene():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the name of the film based on a specific scene description.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The film is \"The Fugitive\" (1993).\n    # The character is Dr. Richard Kimble (Harrison Ford).\n    # While disguised and escaping on a bus, a transit cop checks on him.\n    # The cop starts to walk away, but Kimble's quiet \"Thank you\" makes the cop turn back,\n    # leading to his discovery. This act seals his immediate fate, forcing him back on the run.\n    film_title = \"The Fugitive\"\n    \n    print(f\"The Oscar-nominated film in which a character seals his fate by saying \\\"Thank you\\\" while boarding a bus is: {film_title}\")\n\nfind_movie_by_scene()\n```\n<<<The Fugitive>>>"

Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
