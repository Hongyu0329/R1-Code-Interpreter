# This plan analyzes the riddle to identify a Chinese character based on its strokes.

# 1. Deconstruct the riddle's clues.
# The clue "One horizontal stroke, another horizontal stroke..." implies there are 2 horizontal strokes.
num_horizontal_strokes = 2
print(f"The riddle describes {num_horizontal_strokes} horizontal strokes.")

# The clue "one vertical stroke, another vertical stroke..." implies there are 2 vertical strokes.
# The clue "one vertical on the left, one vertical on the right" confirms their placement.
num_vertical_strokes = 2
print(f"The riddle also describes {num_vertical_strokes} vertical strokes.")

# 2. Form an equation based on the stroke count.
total_strokes = num_horizontal_strokes + num_vertical_strokes
print("\nThis can be represented as a simple stroke count equation:")
# The following line prints each number in the final equation as requested.
print(f"{num_horizontal_strokes} + {num_vertical_strokes} = {total_strokes}")

# 3. Identify the character.
# The character with 2 horizontal and 2 vertical strokes in a grid is "井".
final_character = "井"
print(f"\nThe character formed by these strokes is '{final_character}' (pinyin: jǐng), which means 'well'.")
