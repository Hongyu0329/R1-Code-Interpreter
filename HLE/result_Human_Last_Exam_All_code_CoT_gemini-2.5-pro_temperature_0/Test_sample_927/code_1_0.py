    This function explains the reasoning behind the solution to the mathematical logic problem.
    The problem asks to identify the class of subsets of natural numbers (N) that are definable
    by existential formulas in the real numbers (R) with a predicate for N.
    """

    # Step 1: The problem is about the expressive power of a specific logical language.
    # The language allows polynomial equations and a predicate P(t) which is true if t is a natural number.
    # The formulas are existential, meaning of the form "there exist real numbers y_1, ..., y_k such that...".

    # Step 2: This setup is strongly related to the DPRM (Davis-Putnam-Robinson-Matiyasevich) theorem.
    # The DPRM theorem states that a set is recursively enumerable (RE) if and only if it is Diophantine.
    # A set S is Diophantine if n is in S <=> exists z_1, ..., z_k in N such that Q(n, z_1, ..., z_k) = 0
    # for some polynomial Q with integer coefficients.

    # Step 3: We show that any RE set is definable in the given system.
    # The Diophantine representation of an RE set can be directly translated into an existential formula:
    # exists z_1, ..., z_k (P(z_1) AND ... AND P(z_k) AND Q(n, z_1, ..., z_k) = 0)
    # This formula fits the required structure, proving that all RE sets are definable.

    # Step 4: The converse, that any definable set is RE, is a deep result in model theory.
    # It has been established that the existentially definable subsets of integers in the structure of the reals
    # are precisely the RE sets. The structure with a predicate for N is equivalent in power.
    # Therefore, the class of definable sets is exactly the class of RE sets.

    # Step 5: Based on this conclusion, we select the correct answer choice.
    # The correct choice must be "recursively enumerable subsets of N".

    answer = "D"
    explanation = "The set of subsets of N definable by an existential L-formula in R with real parameters corresponds precisely to the recursively enumerable (RE) subsets of N."

    print(explanation)
    print(f"This matches answer choice {answer}.")
