# The problem asks for the limit of n * P(n) as n goes to infinity.
# Based on the analysis using the local limit theorem, this limit is (6 * sqrt(3)) / pi.

# Define the constants in the final expression
numerator_coeff = 6
# The value inside the square root
sqrt_val = 3
# The denominator is pi
denominator = math.pi

# Calculate the components
sqrt_of_3 = math.sqrt(sqrt_val)
numerator = numerator_coeff * sqrt_of_3

# Calculate the final result
result = numerator / denominator

# Output the equation and the result
print(f"The limit is given by the expression: ({numerator_coeff} * sqrt({sqrt_val})) / pi")
print(f"Calculation: ({numerator_coeff} * {sqrt_of_3}) / {denominator}")
print(f"The final value of the limit is: {result}")
