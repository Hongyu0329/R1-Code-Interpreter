    This function determines the second smallest cardinal for the given tower definition.
    
    The problem describes a cardinal characteristic known as the distributivity number h(κ),
    for κ = ω₂. The set of possible tower lengths δ is [h(ω₂), ∞).

    1. A ZFC theorem by Shelah states h(κ) > κ for successor cardinals κ.
       Since ω₂ = (ω₁)^+, it is a successor cardinal. Thus, h(ω₂) > ω₂.
       This implies the smallest possible δ is at least ω₃.

    2. To find a specific value, we assume the Generalized Continuum Hypothesis (GCH).
       Under GCH, 2^κ = κ⁺.
       A general ZFC theorem states h(κ) ≤ 2^κ.
       For κ = ω₂, h(ω₂) ≤ 2^(ω₂) = ω₃ (under GCH).

    3. Combining these, h(ω₂) = ω₃ under GCH.
       The smallest cardinal δ is ω₃.

    4. The second smallest cardinal is the successor of ω₃, which is ω₄.
