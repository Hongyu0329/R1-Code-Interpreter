    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the structure of the category $C$ of indecomposable finite-dimensional representations of $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$ when $q$ is a primitive third root of unity.\n\n### Step-by-step Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the correct algebraic structure:** The question concerns representations of $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$ where $q$ is a root of unity. In this context, it is standard to consider the \"small quantum group,\" also denoted $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$, which is a finite-dimensional Hopf algebra. If we were to consider the full (infinite-dimensional) quantum group $U_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$, there would be an infinite number of indecomposable modules but only a finite number of irreducible ones, making the percentage 0. The structure of the small quantum group provides a finite and more interesting answer.\n\n2.  **Determine the key parameter:** For a primitive $l$-th root of unity, the representation theory depends on the integer $l$. Since $q$ is a primitive third root of unity, we have $l=3$.\n\n3.  **Count the total number of indecomposable modules:** For the small quantum group $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$, the number of non-isomorphic indecomposable modules is finite and equal to the number of non-isomorphic simple (irreducible) modules. This number is known to be $2l$.\n    *   For $l=3$, the total number of indecomposable modules is $2 \\times 3 = 6$.\n\n4.  **Count the number of irreducible indecomposable modules:** An indecomposable module is irreducible if and only if it is simple. In the context of the representation theory of $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$, this occurs when the simple module lies in a \"block\" of size one.\n\n5.  **Analyze the block structure:** The simple modules are partitioned into blocks based on the linkage principle. For $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$, the simple modules are indexed by a sign $\\epsilon \\in \\{\\pm 1\\}$ and an integer $n \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, l-1\\}$. Two indices $n_1$ and $n_2$ are in the same block if they are linked. The fundamental linkage rule connects the index $n$ with $l-1-n$.\n    *   A block will contain only one simple module (i.e., have size one) if the index $n$ is only linked to itself. This happens if $n = l-1-n$.\n    *   Solving for $n$, we get $2n = l-1$.\n\n6.  **Apply to the specific case $l=3$:**\n    *   We check for which $n \\in \\{0, 1, 2\\}$ the condition $2n = l-1$ holds.\n    *   $2n = 3-1 \\implies 2n = 2 \\implies n=1$.\n    *   So, for $n=1$, the corresponding simple module is in a block of size one.\n    *   For $n=0$, the linked index is $3-1-0=2$. So, indices $0$ and $2$ form a block of size two.\n    *   This structure exists for both sign choices, $\\epsilon=+1$ and $\\epsilon=-1$.\n    *   Therefore, there are two blocks of size one (one for $(\\epsilon, n)=(+1, 1)$ and one for $(\\epsilon, n)=(-1, 1)$).\n\n7.  **Calculate the final percentage:**\n    *   Total number of indecomposable modules = 6.\n    *   Number of irreducible indecomposable modules = Number of blocks of size one = 2.\n    *   The percentage is $(\\frac{2}{6}) \\times 100\\% = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 100\\% \\approx 33.33\\%$.\n\nThe following Python code implements this calculation.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_irreducible_percentage():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the percentage of irreducible objects in the category C.\n\n    The category C is interpreted as the category of indecomposable finite-dimensional\n    representations for the small quantum group u_q(sl_2), where q is a primitive\n    l-th root of unity.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The problem states q is a primitive third root of unity, so l=3.\n    l = 3\n    print(f\"The parameter l for the primitive root of unity is: {l}\")\n\n    # For the small quantum group u_q(sl_2), the total number of non-isomorphic\n    # indecomposable modules is 2*l.\n    total_indecomposables = 2 * l\n    print(f\"The total number of indecomposable modules is 2 * l = {total_indecomposables}.\")\n\n    # An indecomposable module is irreducible if and only if its corresponding simple\n    # module lies in a block of size one.
