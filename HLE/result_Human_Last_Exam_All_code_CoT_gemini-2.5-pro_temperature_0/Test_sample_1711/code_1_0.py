# Parameters from the problem
# The group is G = (Z/p^2Z)^n where p=7, n=2024.
p = 7
n = 2024

# The number of cyclic subgroups of order p is the number of 1-dimensional
# subspaces in the vector space (F_p)^n.
# The formula is (p^n - 1) / (p - 1).
# This is the minimum number of non-zero elements required.
numerator = p**n - 1
denominator = p - 1
num_nontrivial_elements = numerator // denominator

# We must also include the zero element to hit the trivial subgroup {0}.
# The total size of the set A is the number of non-trivial elements plus one.
final_size = num_nontrivial_elements + 1

# As requested, we output the final equation with its numbers and the result.
print(f"The final equation for the smallest size of set A is: (({p}^{n} - 1) / {denominator}) + 1")
print(f"Result: {final_size}")
