    "To determine the number of colors observed in pure allotropes of phosphorus, we need to identify the main allotropes and their characteristic colors.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  List the most common and distinct allotropes of phosphorus.\n2.  Identify the color of each allotrope.\n3.  Create a list of these unique colors.\n4.  Write a Python script to count the number of items in this list.\n5.  The script will print out each color and then show the final count as a sum, fulfilling the request to show the numbers in the final equation.\n\nThe primary allotropes and their colors are:\n*   **White Phosphorus:** A waxy solid that is white but can appear yellowish. We will count this as one color family: white/yellow.\n*   **Red Phosphorus:** An amorphous solid that is red.\n*   **Violet Phosphorus:** A crystalline form, also known as Hittorf's metallic phosphorus, which is violet.\n*   **Black Phosphorus:** The most stable form, which is black and flaky, similar in appearance to graphite.\n*   **Blue Phosphorus:** A more recently discovered two-dimensional allotrope.\n\nBased on this, we can identify 5 distinct colors. The following Python code will list these colors and provide the total count.\n\n```python\ndef count_phosphorus_colors():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and counts the colors of the main\n    allotropes of phosphorus.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A list of the distinct colors of phosphorus allotropes.\n    colors = [\n        \"White (or yellow)\",\n        \"Red\",\n        \"Violet\",\n        \"Black\",\n        \"Blue\"\n    ]\n\n    # Get the total number of colors.\n    num_colors = len(colors)\n\n    print(\"The distinct colors observed in the main allotropes of phosphorus are:\")\n    for color in colors:\n        print(f\"- {color}\")\n\n    # To represent the count as an equation, we show a sum of 1 for each color.\n    equation_parts = [\"1\" for _ in colors]\n    equation_str = \" + \".join(equation_parts)\n\n    print(\"\\nTo find the total, we count each distinct color:\")\n    print(f\"{equation_str} = {num_colors}\")\n\n    print(f\"\\nTherefore, {num_colors} distinct colors can be observed in pure allotropes of phosphorus.\")\n\ncount_phosphorus_colors()\n```\n<<<5>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    How many colors can be observed in pure allotropes of phosphorous?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
