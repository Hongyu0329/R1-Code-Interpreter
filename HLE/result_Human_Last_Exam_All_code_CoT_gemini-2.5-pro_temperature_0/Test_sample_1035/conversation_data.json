    "To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum value of $\\sum_{i=1}^k |V(G_i)|$, where $\\{G_1, G_2, \\dots, G_k\\}$ is a family of bipartite graphs whose edge sets cover the edge set of the complete graph $K_n$, with $n=35$.\n\nThis is a classic problem in extremal graph theory. The minimum total number of vertices required is given by the formula:\n$$ \\text{Minimum vertices} = n \\lceil \\log_2 n \\rceil $$\n\nHere's a brief explanation of why this formula holds:\n\n1.  **Construction (Upper Bound):** We can show that $n \\lceil \\log_2 n \\rceil$ vertices are sufficient. Let $k = \\lceil \\log_2 n \\rceil$. This means $2^{k-1} < n \\le 2^k$. We can assign a unique binary vector of length $k$ to each of the $n$ vertices. For each bit position $j \\in \\{1, \\dots, k\\}$, we define a bipartite graph $G_j$. The vertex set of $G_j$ is all $n$ vertices of $K_n$. We create a bipartition $(A_j, B_j)$ where $A_j$ contains all vertices whose $j$-th bit is 0, and $B_j$ contains all vertices whose $j$-th bit is 1. We add all edges between $A_j$ and $B_j$ to $G_j$.\n    Any edge $(u, v)$ from $K_n$ must be covered. Since $u \\neq v$, their binary vectors must differ in at least one position, say the $j$-th position. This means one vertex is in $A_j$ and the other is in $B_j$, so the edge $(u, v)$ is in $G_j$.\n    The total number of vertices in this construction is $\\sum_{j=1}^k |V(G_j)| = \\sum_{j=1}^k n = n \\times k = n \\lceil \\log_2 n \\rceil$.\n\n2.  **Lower Bound:** It has been proven (by Hansel, and also by Katona and Tverberg) that this value is indeed the minimum possible.\n\nNow, we will apply this formula to the case where $n=35$.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  Set the value of $n$ to 35.\n2.  Calculate $k = \\lceil \\log_2 35 \\rceil$.\n3.  Compute the final result by multiplying $n$ and $k$.\n4.  Print the steps of the calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_bipartite_covering():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the minimum number of vertices in a family of bipartite graphs\n    covering all the edges of the complete graph K_n.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = 35\n\n    # The formula for the minimum number of vertices is n * ceil(log2(n)).\n    \n    # Step 1: Explain the value of n.\n    print(f\"The number of vertices in the complete graph is n = {n}.\")\n    \n    # Step 2: Calculate ceil(log2(n)).\n    # We need to find the smallest integer k such that 2^k >= n.\n    # 2^5 = 32\n    # 2^6 = 64\n    # Since 32 < 35 <= 64, the ceiling of log2(35) is 6.\n    log_val = math.log2(n)\n    k = math.ceil(log_val)\n    \n    print(f\"To find the minimum number of bipartite graphs for the construction, we calculate ceil(log2(n)).\")\n    print(f\"log2({n}) is approximately {log_val:.4f}.\")\n    print(f\"The ceiling of {log_val:.4f} is {k}.\")\n    \n    # Step 3: Calculate the final result.\n    result = n * k\n    \n    # Step 4: Print the final equation and result.\n    print(\"\\nThe minimum total number of vertices is given by the formula n * ceil(log2(n)).\")\n    print(\"The final calculation is:\")\n    print(f\"{n} * {k} = {result}\")\n\nsolve_bipartite_covering()\n```\n<<<210>>>"
