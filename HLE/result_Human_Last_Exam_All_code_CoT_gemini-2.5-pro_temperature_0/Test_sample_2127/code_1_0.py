# The function is f(x) = f1(x) + f2(x).
# The 4th Maclaurin coefficient is the coefficient of x^4 in the series expansion.
# This is the sum of the coefficients from f1(x) and f2(x).

# Part 1: Analyze the first term f1(x)
# f1(x) = 9 * x**4 / (16 * e)
# The coefficient of x**4 in f1(x) is 9 / (16 * e).

f2 = 4 * N1 * N2 * N3 / (D1 * D2 * D3)

# The term f2(x) has a pole at x=0, so we compute its Laurent series.
# We need to find the coefficient of x**4 in this series.
# We compute the series up to O(x^5) to ensure we can extract the x^4 coefficient.

# The total coefficient is the sum of the two coefficients.
total_coeff = coeff1_val + coeff2_val

# The final equation for the coefficient is C = C1 + C2
# where C1 is from the first term and C2 is from the second.
# The prompt asks to output each number in the final equation.
# The equation is C = 9/(16*e) + 0
