    "Of course. This is a fascinating philosophical question that touches on logic, metaphysics, and physics. A direct computational proof is not possible, as this problem resides in the domain of formal logic and philosophy, not numerical computation or standard physics simulations. The mathematical language of quantum mechanics (linear algebra, Hilbert spaces) and the language of Gödel's ontological proof (higher-order modal logic) are not directly translatable. There is no established scientific or mathematical consensus that connects the two in a way that would allow for such a proof.\n\nHowever, I can provide a Python script that programmatically outlines the logical structure of Gödel's ontological proof. This will not *prove* the conclusion, but it will demonstrate the axioms and definitions that form the chain of reasoning, as you requested by asking to \"output each number in the final equation\" (which I will interpret as each step in the logical argument). This allows us to examine the argument's structure using code.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  Define a function to print the logical steps of the proof.\n2.  The function will use a series of `print` statements to clearly list each definition, axiom, and key theorem in the argument.\n3.  This will present Gödel's argument in a structured, step-by-step format, making the logical flow explicit.\n\n```python\ndef outline_goedels_ontological_proof():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function prints a step-by-step outline of the logical structure\n    of Gödel's ontological proof for the existence of a God-like being.\n    This is a representation of a formal logic argument, not a computational proof.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"--- An Outline of Gödel's Ontological Proof ---\")\n    print(\"\\nThis script outlines the definitions, axioms, and theorems of the proof.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"--- Part 1: Definitions ---\")\n    print(\"Step 1 (Definition 1): A being is 'God-like' if and only if it possesses all 'positive' properties.\")\n    print(\"Step 2 (Definition 2): A property 'A' is the 'essence' of a being 'x' if 'x' has property 'A', and 'A' necessarily entails every other property that 'x' has.\")\n    print(\"Step 3 (Definition 3): A being 'x' has 'necessary existence' if, for every essential property 'A' of 'x', there must necessarily exist a being with property 'A'.\")\n\n    print(\"\\n--- Part 2: Axioms ---\")\n    print(\"Step 4 (Axiom 1): For any property 'P', either 'P' is positive or its negation 'not-P' is positive, but not both.\")\n    print(\"Step 5 (Axiom 2): Any property that is necessarily entailed by a positive property is itself positive.\")\n    print(\"Step 6 (Axiom 3): The property of being 'God-like' is a positive property.\")\n    print(\"Step 7 (Axiom 4): If a property 'P' is positive, then the property of 'necessarily having P' is also positive.\")\n    print(\"Step 8 (Axiom 5): 'Necessary existence' is a positive property.\")\n\n    print(\"\\n--- Part 3: Main Logical Deductions (Theorems) ---\")\n    print(\"Step 9 (Theorem 1): If a property is positive, then it is possible for some being to have that property.\")\n    print(\"Step 10 (Conclusion 1): It is possible that a God-like being exists.\")\n    print(\"Step 11 (Theorem 2): If a being is God-like, then the property of being God-like is its essence.\")\n    print(\"Step 12 (Conclusion 2): Since a God-like being possesses all positive properties (by Def. 1), and necessary existence is a positive property (by Axiom 5), a God-like being must have the property of necessary existence.\")\n    print(\"Step 13 (Final Conclusion): Because it is possible that a God-like being exists (Conclusion 1), and since that being would have necessary existence (Conclusion 2), it must therefore necessarily exist in reality.\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    outline_goedels_ontological_proof()\n```\n<<<No>>>"
