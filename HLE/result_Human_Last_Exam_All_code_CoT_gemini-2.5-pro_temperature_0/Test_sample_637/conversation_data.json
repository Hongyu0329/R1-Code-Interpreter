    "To design a deadbeat observer for the given discrete-time system, we need to find an observer gain matrix `L` such that the state estimation error converges to zero in the shortest possible time. The error dynamics are governed by the equation `e(k+1) = (A - LC)e(k)`. For a deadbeat response, all eigenvalues of the matrix `(A - LC)` must be placed at the origin of the complex plane (i.e., all eigenvalues must be 0).\n\nThis is a pole placement problem. We can solve this by considering the dual control problem. The eigenvalues of `(A - LC)` are the same as the eigenvalues of its transpose, `(A - LC)^T = A^T - C^T L^T`. The problem is now to find a feedback gain matrix `K = L^T` for the dual system with state matrix `A_d = A^T` and input matrix `B_d = C^T`, such that the closed-loop matrix `A_d - B_d K` has all its eigenvalues at zero.\n\nThe dual system `(A_d, B_d)` is a multi-input system since `C` has two rows (i.e., the system has two outputs). Pole placement for multi-input systems can be complex. However, we can simplify the problem if the system is controllable through only one of the inputs. This would correspond to designing an observer that uses only one of the system's outputs.\n\nLet's test the controllability of the dual system using only the second input, which corresponds to the second row of `C`, `c2 = [1, 0, 0, 1]`. If the pair `(A^T, c2^T)` is controllable, we can place the poles using only the second output. A check confirms that this pair is indeed controllable.\n\nTherefore, we can design an observer that only uses the second output. The observer gain matrix `L` will have its first column as all zeros, and its second column will be a gain vector `l` that we need to determine. We will use Ackermann's formula for single-input systems to find the required gain `k` for the dual system `(A^T, c2^T)`. The observer gain vector will then be `l = k^T`.\n\nThe plan is as follows:\n1.  Define the system matrices `A` and `C`.\n2.  Select the second row of `C`, `c2`, to form a single-input dual system `(A^T, c2^T)`.\n3.  Compute the controllability matrix `Oc` for this single-input system.\n4.  Apply Ackermann's formula to find the state feedback gain `k` that places all poles of `(A^T - c2^T k)` at the origin. The formula is `k = [0, ..., 1] * inv(Oc) * (A^T)^n`.\n5.  The required observer gain vector is `l = k^T`.\n6.  Construct the final observer gain matrix `L` by setting its first column to zero and its second column to `l`.\n7.  The Python code below will perform these calculations and print the final gain matrix `L`.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Designs a deadbeat observer for the given discrete-time system.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the system matrices A and C.\n    A = np.array([[-1, 0, 0, 1],\n                  [1, 0, 0, 2],\n                  [0, 1, 0, -1],\n                  [-1, 0, 1, -1]])\n\n    C = np.array([[1, 0, 0, 0],\n                  [1, 0, 0, 1]])\n\n    n = A.shape[0]  # Dimension of the state\n\n    # Step 2: Form the single-input dual system using the second output.\n    # The state matrix of the dual system is A.T.\n    # The input vector of the dual system is the transpose of the second row of C.\n    Ad = A.T\n    c2 = C[1, :]\n    Bd = c2.reshape(-1, 1)\n\n    # Step 3: Compute the controllability matrix Oc for the dual system (Ad, Bd).\n    # Oc = [Bd, Ad*Bd, Ad^2*Bd, ..., Ad^(n-1)*Bd]\n    Oc = np.hstack([np.linalg.matrix_power(Ad, i) @ Bd for i in range(n)])\n\n    # Check if the system is controllable.
