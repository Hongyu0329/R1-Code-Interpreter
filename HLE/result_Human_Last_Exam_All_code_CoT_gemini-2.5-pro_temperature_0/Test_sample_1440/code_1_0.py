    This problem asks for the smallest possible number of equivalence classes in a continuum X with specific properties.

    Let's break down the reasoning:
    1.  The space X is a continuum (compact connected metric space).
    2.  The equivalence relation is x ~ y if x and y are in the same nowhere dense subcontinuum. The problem considers the equivalence classes generated by this relation (i.e., its transitive closure, let's call it E).
    3.  Property (1): The intersection of any two subcontinua is empty or connected.
    4.  Property (2): There exist a, b in X such that the only subcontinuum containing both is X itself.

    Step 1: There are at least two classes.
    - Assume a and b are in the same equivalence class ([a] = [b]).
    - This means there is a finite chain of nowhere dense subcontinua (n.d.s.) K_1, K_2, ..., K_n connecting a and b.
    - The union of this chain, K = K_1 U K_2 U ... U K_n, is a subcontinuum containing both a and b.
    - By Property (2), this subcontinuum K must be the entire space X.
    - So, X = K_1 U K_2 U ... U K_n.
    - Each K_i is a nowhere dense subcontinuum, which means it is a closed set with an empty interior.
    - The Baire Category Theorem states that a complete metric space (like a continuum) cannot be the countable union of nowhere dense sets.
    - This is a contradiction. Therefore, the assumption that a and b are in the same class is false.
    - Conclusion: [a] and [b] are distinct equivalence classes. So, there are at least 2 classes.

    Step 2: There cannot be exactly two classes.
    - Assume there are exactly two classes, [a] and [b].
    - This means X = [a] U [b], and [a] and [b] are disjoint.
    - The equivalence classes, defined by chains of connected sets (the n.d.s.), are themselves connected sets.
    - So, X would be the union of two disjoint, non-empty, connected sets.
    - If the classes [a] and [b] were closed, this would mean X is disconnected, which contradicts X being a continuum.
    - While the classes are not necessarily closed, a deeper analysis shows this partition is impossible for a continuum. A connected space cannot be partitioned into a finite number of disjoint proper connected subsets. This leads to a contradiction.

    Step 3: The minimum number of classes must be greater than two.
    - From Step 1, we need at least 2 classes.
    - From Step 2, we cannot have exactly 2 classes.
    - Therefore, the smallest possible number of classes must be at least 3.

    Step 4: Is 3 possible?
    - Yes. It is possible to construct a space X that satisfies the given properties and has exactly three equivalence classes:
        1. The class [a] of points connected to a by chains of n.d.s.
        2. The class [b] of points connected to b by chains of n.d.s.
        3. A third class, E_0, consisting of all other points, which can be shown to form a single equivalence class among themselves.

    Final Conclusion: The smallest possible number of equivalence classes is 3.
