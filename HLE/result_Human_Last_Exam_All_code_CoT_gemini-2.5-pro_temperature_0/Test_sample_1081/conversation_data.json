    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the type of the group:** The group $G$ is of type $E_8$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$. The Dynkin diagram of type $E_8$ has a trivial automorphism group. This implies that any algebraic group of type $E_8$ is split over its field of definition. Therefore, $G$ is a split reductive group.\n\n2.  **Find the formula for the number of rational maximal tori:** For a split connected reductive group $G$ defined over $\\mathbb{F}_q$, the total number of maximal tori that are rational over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is given by the formula:\n    $$ N = \\frac{|G(\\mathbb{F}_q)|}{|T_0(\\mathbb{F}_q)|} $$\n    where $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$ is the finite group of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational points of $G$, and $T_0$ is a split maximal torus of $G$.\n\n3.  **Find the order of the group |G(F_q)|:** The order of a split group of Lie type is given by the Chevalley formula:\n    $$ |G(\\mathbb{F}_q)| = q^N \\prod_{i=1}^{l} (q^{d_i} - 1) $$\n    where $N$ is the number of positive roots, $l$ is the rank of the group, and $d_i$ are the degrees of the fundamental invariants of its Weyl group.\n    For type $E_8$:\n    *   The rank is $l=8$.\n    *   The number of positive roots is $N=120$.\n    *   The degrees of the fundamental invariants are $d_i \\in \\{2, 8, 12, 14, 18, 20, 24, 30\\}$.\n\n4.  **Find the order of the split torus |T_0(F_q)|:** A split maximal torus $T_0$ of rank $l$ is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{G}_m)^l$ over the base field. The group of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational points is $T_0(\\mathbb{F}_q) \\cong (\\mathbb{F}_q^\\times)^l$.\n    The order is $|T_0(\\mathbb{F}_q)| = (q-1)^l$. For $E_8$, this is $(q-1)^8$.\n\n5.  **Combine the results:** Substitute the orders into the formula from step 2 to get the final expression for the number of tori.\n\n6.  **Construct Python code:** Write a Python script to assemble and print the final formula, ensuring all the numerical constants ($N$, $l$, and the degrees $d_i$) are explicitly shown in the output as requested.\n\n```python\ndef get_number_of_tori():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates and prints the formula for the exact number of\n    F_q-rational maximal tori of a reductive group of type E_8.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the parameters for the E_8 group type.\n    # The number of positive roots for E_8.\n    num_positive_roots = 120\n    # The rank of E_8.\n    rank = 8\n    # The degrees of the fundamental invariants for the Weyl group of type E_8.\n    degrees = [2, 8, 12, 14, 18, 20, 24, 30]\n\n    # Step 2: Explain the theoretical basis for the calculation.\n    print(\"A reductive group G of type E_8 over a finite field F_q is always split.\")\n    print(\"The number of F_q-rational maximal tori is given by the ratio |G(F_q)| / |T_0(F_q)|,\")\n    print(\"where T_0 is a split maximal torus.\")\n    print(\"\")\n\n    # Step 3: Present the formula for the order of the group G(F_q).\n    order_G_terms = [f\"q^{num_positive_roots}\"]\n    for d in degrees:\n        order_G_terms.append(f\"(q^{d} - 1)\")\n    print(f\"The order of the group is |G(F_q)| = {' * '.join(order_G_terms)}.\")\n\n    # Step 4: Present the formula for the order of the split torus T_0(F_q).\n    print(f\"The order of the split torus is |T_0(F_q)| = (q - 1)^{rank}.\")\n    print(\"\")\n\n    # Step 5: Construct and print the final formula for the number of tori.\n    print(\"The exact number of F_q-rational maximal tori is the ratio, which simplifies to:\")\n    \n    final_formula_terms = [f\"q^{num_positive_roots}\"]\n    for d in degrees:\n        # The term (q^d - 1) / (q - 1) is the sum of a geometric series.\n        # We present it in a way that makes the degree 'd' explicit.\n        final_formula_terms.append(f\"((q^{d} - 1)/(q - 1))\")\n    \n    final_formula = \" * \".join(final_formula_terms)\n    print(final_formula)\n\nget_number_of_tori()\n```\n<<<q^120 * ((q^2 - 1)/(q - 1)) * ((q^8 - 1)/(q - 1)) * ((q^12 - 1)/(q - 1)) * ((q^14 - 1)/(q - 1)) * ((q^18 - 1)/(q - 1)) * ((q^20 - 1)/(q - 1)) * ((q^24 - 1)/(q - 1)) * ((q^30 - 1)/(q - 1))>>>"
