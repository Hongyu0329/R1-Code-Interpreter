    # The problem asks for the smallest integer k such that Z(P, T), a specific subset of 
    # the zero set of a polynomial P of degree D, can always be covered by O(D^k) unit balls.

    # Let's analyze the set Z(P, T).
    # A point p is in Z(P, T) if it is in the zero set of P inside the cylinder T,
    # and the tangent plane at p forms an angle > 1/10 with the cylinder's direction (the z-axis).
    # This geometric condition on the angle translates to an algebraic condition on the partial derivatives of P.
    # Let n = grad(P) be the normal to the surface. The condition is |n_z| / ||n|| > sin(1/10).

    # Step 1: Finding an upper bound for k.
    # The number of balls needed to cover a surface depends on its geometric complexity.
    # Key results from real algebraic geometry bound the complexity of algebraic surfaces.
    #
    # 1. The set Z(P, T) is contained in a compact region. The condition on the angle,
    #    |P_z| / ||grad(P)|| > c > 0, cannot hold for very large |z|, because for a polynomial,
    #    derivatives with respect to x or y typically grow faster with |z| than P_z if the degree of P
    #    in z is less than D, or the ratio tends to 0 for other reasons. This means Z(P, T)
    #    is contained in a cylinder of finite height, say L.
    #
    # 2. The boundary of Z(P, T) on the surface is an algebraic curve defined by P=0 and
    #    |P_z| / ||grad(P)|| = sin(1/10). This curve has a degree of at most D * 2(D-1) = O(D^2).
    #
    # 3. The length of an algebraic curve of degree d in a compact set is O(d). So, the boundary
    #    of Z(P, T) has a total length of O(D^2).
    #
    # 4. The area of an algebraic surface of degree D in a compact set is O(D).
    #
    # 5. The number of unit balls needed to cover such a surface is bounded by a function of its
    #    area and boundary length, roughly O(Area + Boundary Length).
    #    This gives a bound of O(D + D^2) = O(D^2).
    #
    # From this, we conclude that k must be less than or equal to 2.

    # Step 2: Finding a lower bound for k.
    # To show that k=2 is the smallest possible value, we need to construct a "worst-case"
    # polynomial P for which we need at least Omega(D^2) balls.
    #
    # 1. Consider a polynomial of the form P(x, y, z) = Q(x, y) - z, where Q is a polynomial of degree D.
    #    The zero set is the graph of the function z = Q(x, y).
    #
    # 2. The angle condition for Z(P, T) on this surface simplifies to the gradient of Q being small:
    #    ||grad(Q)|| < C, for some constant C.
    #
    # 3. The regions where ||grad(Q)|| is small are located around the critical points of Q, where grad(Q) = 0.
    #
    # 4. By Bezout's theorem, Q can have up to (D-1)^2 critical points. It is possible to construct
    #    a polynomial Q of degree D with Omega(D^2) critical points inside the unit disk (the base of the cylinder T).
    #    Furthermore, these critical points can be made to be separated from each other by a distance
    #    greater than 2.
    #
    # 5. Each of these Omega(D^2) separated critical points corresponds to a small patch on the surface
    #    that belongs to Z(P, T). Since these patches are separated by a distance greater than 2,
    #    each one requires its own unit ball to be covered.
    #
    # 6. This construction implies that we need at least Omega(D^2) balls.
    #
    # From this, we conclude that k must be greater than or equal to 2.

    # Step 3: Conclusion.
    # The upper bound is k <= 2 and the lower bound is k >= 2.
    # Therefore, the smallest possible value for k is 2.
    
    k = 2
