    "Here is a plan to solve the problem:\n1.  **Identify Given Information:**\n    *   The electron is in the first Bohr orbit, so the principal quantum number `n = 1`.\n    *   The uncertainty in the electron's position is `Δx = 10 pm = 10 * 10^-12 m`.\n\n2.  **Determine Necessary Physical Principles and Constants:**\n    *   **Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle:** The minimum uncertainty in momentum `Δp` is related to the uncertainty in position `Δx` by the formula `Δp = ħ / (2 * Δx)`, where `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant.\n    *   **Momentum in a Bohr Orbit:** The momentum `p` of an electron in the n-th Bohr orbit is given by `p = n * ħ / r_n`, where `r_n` is the radius of the n-th orbit. For the first orbit (`n=1`), the radius `r_1` is the Bohr radius, `a₀`.\n    *   **Physical Constants:**\n        *   Reduced Planck constant (`ħ`) ≈ 1.05457 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n        *   Bohr radius (`a₀`) ≈ 5.29177 x 10⁻¹¹ m\n\n3.  **Formulate the Calculation:**\n    *   First, calculate the uncertainty in momentum: `Δp = ħ / (2 * Δx)`.\n    *   Second, calculate the momentum in the first Bohr orbit: `p = 1 * ħ / a₀`.\n    *   Finally, compute the desired ratio: `Ratio = Δp / p`.\n\n4.  **Execute the Calculation using Python:**\n    *   The Python script will define the constants and given values, perform the calculations as described above, and print the intermediate values (`Δp`, `p`) and the final ratio.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the physical constants and given values\n# Reduced Planck constant in J.s\nhbar = 1.054571817e-34\n# Bohr radius (radius of the first orbit, n=1) in meters\na0 = 5.29177210903e-11\n# Uncertainty in position in meters (10 pm = 10 * 10^-12 m)\ndelta_x = 10e-12\n# Principal quantum number for the first Bohr orbit\nn = 1\n\n# 1. Calculate the uncertainty in momentum (delta_p) using Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle\n# delta_p * delta_x >= hbar / 2\n# We use the minimum uncertainty: delta_p = hbar / (2 * delta_x)\ndelta_p = hbar / (2 * delta_x)\n\n# 2. Calculate the momentum (p) of the electron in the first Bohr orbit\n# Angular momentum L = mvr = n * hbar. Since p = mv, then p = n * hbar / r.\n# For the first orbit, n=1 and r = a0 (Bohr radius).\np = (n * hbar) / a0\n\n# 3. Calculate the ratio of the uncertainty in momentum to the momentum\nratio = delta_p / p\n\n# Print the results\nprint(f\"Uncertainty in position (Δx): {delta_x:.2e} m\")\nprint(f\"Momentum in the first Bohr orbit (p): {p:.4e} kg·m/s\")\nprint(f\"Uncertainty in momentum (Δp): {delta_p:.4e} kg·m/s\")\nprint(\"\\nThe final equation is: Ratio = Δp / p\")\nprint(f\"Ratio = {delta_p:.4e} / {p:.4e}\")\nprint(f\"The calculated ratio is: {ratio}\")\n\n<<<2.6458860545150004>>>\n```"
