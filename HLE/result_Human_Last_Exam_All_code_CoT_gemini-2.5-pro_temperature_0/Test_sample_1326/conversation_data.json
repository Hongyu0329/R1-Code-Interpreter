    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the definite integral of the piecewise function $p(x)$ over the interval $[0, 4]$. The function is defined differently on two sub-intervals, so we must split the integral at the point where the function definition changes, which is at $x=3$.\n\nThe integral can be expressed as:\n$I = \\int_{0}^{4} p(x) dx = \\int_{0}^{3} p(x) dx + \\int_{3}^{4} p(x) dx$\n\nFor the interval $0 \\le x \\le 3$, the function is $p(x) = \\frac{2x^3}{8} = \\frac{x^3}{4}$.\nFor the interval $3 \\le x \\le 4$, the function is $p(x) = \\frac{e^x(1+ \\sin x)}{(1+\\cos x)}$.\n\nSo, we need to calculate the two integrals separately and then add them together:\n1.  $I_1 = \\int_{0}^{3} \\frac{x^3}{4} dx$\n2.  $I_2 = \\int_{3}^{4} \\frac{e^x(1+ \\sin x)}{(1+\\cos x)} dx$\n\nThe first integral can be solved analytically:\n$I_1 = \\left[ \\frac{x^4}{16} \\right]_{0}^{3} = \\frac{3^4}{16} - \\frac{0^4}{16} = \\frac{81}{16} = 5.0625$\n\nThe second integral is more complex and is best solved using numerical methods. We can use Python's `scipy.integrate.quad` function for this purpose.\n\nHere is the plan for the Python script:\n1.  Import the necessary libraries (`numpy` for mathematical functions and `scipy.integrate` for numerical integration).\n2.  Define the two parts of the function $p(x)$.\n3.  Use `scipy.integrate.quad` to compute the value of the integral for the first part from 0 to 3.\n4.  Use `scipy.integrate.quad` to compute the value of the integral for the second part from 3 to 4.\n5.  Sum the results of the two integrals to get the final answer.\n6.  Print the breakdown of the calculation and the final equation with the numerical results.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.integrate import quad\n\n# Define the first part of the function for the interval [0, 3]\ndef p1(x):\n    \"\"\"\n    p(x) = 2*x^3 / 8 for 0 <= x <= 3\n    \"\"\"\n    return (2 * x**3) / 8\n\n# Define the second part of the function for the interval [3, 5]\ndef p2(x):\n    \"\"\"\n    p(x) = e^x * (1 + sin(x)) / (1 + cos(x)) for 3 <= x <= 5\n    \"\"\"\n    return (np.exp(x) * (1 + np.sin(x))) / (1 + np.cos(x))\n\n# Calculate the integral of the first part from 0 to 3\n# The result from quad is a tuple (value, error_estimate)\nintegral1, error1 = quad(p1, 0, 3)\n\n# Calculate the integral of the second part from 3 to 4\nintegral2, error2 = quad(p2, 3, 4)\n\n# The total integral is the sum of the two parts\ntotal_integral = integral1 + integral2\n\n# Print the results and the final equation\nprint(\"The integral is calculated by splitting it into two parts based on the function's definition.\")\nprint(f\"The integral from x=0 to x=3 is for the function p(x) = 2*x^3 / 8.\")\nprint(f\"The integral from x=3 to x=4 is for the function p(x) = e^x(1+sin(x))/(1+cos(x)).\")\nprint(\"\\n--- Calculation ---\")\nprint(f\"Value of the first integral (0 to 3): {integral1}\")\nprint(f\"Value of the second integral (3 to 4): {integral2}\")\nprint(\"\\nThe total integral is the sum of these two values.\")\nprint(f\"Final Equation: {integral1} + ({integral2}) = {total_integral}\")\n\n```\n<<<-397.4674000478316>>>"
