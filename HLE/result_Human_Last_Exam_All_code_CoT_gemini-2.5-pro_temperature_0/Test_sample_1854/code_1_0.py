# The problem asks for the smallest possible value of c.
# Based on the analysis, the exponent c is determined by the highest possible
# degree of the polynomials, which is d_max = 100.
# The formula for c in the worst-case scenario is c = 1 - 1/d.

d_max = 100

# Calculate the value of c
c = 1 - 1/d_max

# Output the final equation and the result
print("The smallest possible value for the exponent c is determined by the maximal polynomial degree d.")

# Using f-string formatting to display the equation and the result.
# The numbers in the equation are explicitly shown.
print(f"c = 1 - 1/{d_max} = {1.0} - {1/d_max} = {c}")
