    # Step 1: Define the problem state
    # Clauses:
    # C1: x1 \/ x6 \/ x7
    # C2: not x2 \/ not x3 \/ not x4
    # C3: x5 \/ not x2
    # C4: x4 \/ not x5 \/ not x6
    # C5: x6 \/ not x7
    #
    # Decisions:
    # Level 1: x1 = false (not x1 @ 1)
    # Level 2: x3 = true (x3 @ 2)
    # Level 3: x2 = true (x2 @ 3)

    # Step 2 & 3: BCP and Conflict Detection
    # After the decision x2=true@3, BCP proceeds as follows:
    # 1. x2@3 and C3 (x5 \/ not x2) => x5@3 is implied.
    # 2. x2@3, x3@2 and C2 (not x2 \/ not x3 \/ not x4) => not x4@3 is implied.
    # 3. x5@3, not x4@3 and C4 (x4 \/ not x5 \/ not x6) => not x6@3 is implied.
    # 4. not x6@3 and C5 (x6 \/ not x7) => not x7@3 is implied.
    # 5. The assignment {not x1@1, not x6@3, not x7@3} falsifies C1 (x1 \/ x6 \/ x7).
    # This is the conflict.

    # Step 4: Identify all UIPs
    # An implication u at the conflict level (3) is a UIP if all paths from the
    # decision literal (x2@3) to the conflict node pass through u.
    # The implication graph shows two paths from x2@3 to the conflict, which both
    # converge at not x6@3 and continue through not x7@3.
    # The UIPs are the decision literal itself and these common nodes.
    # Listed in order from decision to conflict:
    uips = ["x2@3", "not x6@3", "not x7@3"]

    # Step 5: Find the First UIP and Learned Clause via Resolution
    # The 1UIP learning scheme resolves the conflict clause with antecedents
    # until only one literal from the conflict level remains.
    # - Start with conflict clause C1: (x1 \/ x6 \/ x7)
    # - Resolve with antecedent of the last implication (not x7@3), which is C5: (x6 \/ not x7)
    # - resolve(C1, C5) on x7 gives the new clause: (x1 \/ x6)
    # This new clause contains only one literal (x6) from the conflict level (3).
    # The process stops here.
    # The First UIP is the asserting literal from the conflict level: not x6@3.
    first_uip = "not x6@3"
    
    # The learned clause is the result of the resolution.
    var1_in_clause = 1
    var2_in_clause = 6
    learned_clause = f"x{var1_in_clause} \/ x{var2_in_clause}"

    # Step 6: Determine Backtracking Level
    # The learned clause (x1 \/ x6) contains literals from levels 1 (for x1) and 3 (for x6).
    # The backtracking level is the second-highest level in the clause, which is 1.
    backtracking_level = 1

    # Step 7: Assemble the final answer
    # The request asks for the answers separated by commas. A possible interpretation is
    # to list all UIPs, then the first UIP, then the learned clause, and finally the level.
    
    # Answer 1: All UIPs
    all_uips_str = ", ".join(uips)
    
    # Answer 2: The First UIP
    first_uip_str = first_uip
    
    # Answer 3: The learned clause
    learned_clause_str = learned_clause
    
    # Answer 4: The backtracking level
    backtracking_level_str = str(backtracking_level)

    # Combine all answers into a single string, separating each answer with a comma.
    # The list of UIPs is itself a comma-separated list.
    final_answer_string = f"{all_uips_str}, {first_uip_str}, {learned_clause_str}, {backtracking_level_str}"
