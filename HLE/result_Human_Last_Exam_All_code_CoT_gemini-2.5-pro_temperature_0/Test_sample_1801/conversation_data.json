Finally, the script will use the `print` function to display the names in a sentence that directly answers your question.\n\n```python\ndef find_nobel_laureates():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the names of the two Nobel laureates\n    featured in a 2000 Enron commercial.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The two Nobel laureates featured in the commercial\n    laureate1 = \"Paul Krugman\"\n    laureate2 = \"Merton Miller\"\n\n    # Print the answer in a descriptive sentence\n    print(f\"The two Nobel laureates featured in the 2000 Enron commercial with the tagline 'Ask Why' were {laureate1} and {laureate2}.\")\n\n# Execute the function to print the answer\nfind_nobel_laureates()\n```\n<<<Paul Krugman and Merton Miller>>>"

Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
