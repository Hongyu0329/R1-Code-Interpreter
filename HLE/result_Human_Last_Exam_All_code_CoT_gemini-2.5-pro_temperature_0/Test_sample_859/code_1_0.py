    print("The goal is to find the minimal number of edges to add to graph G' to make it 2-edge-connected.")

    print("Here, L is the number of 'leaves' in the condensation graph of G'. The condensation graph is formed by shrinking each 2-edge-connected component (block) of G' into a single node; the bridges of G' become the edges of this new graph, which is a forest.")
    
    print("\nStep 3: Determine the maximum possible value of L (the worst case).")
    print("The problem asks for a single answer, which implies the result should hold for any graph G satisfying the conditions. This means we must find the number of edges for the worst-case scenario, which is the one that maximizes L.")

    print("Let B be any block in G'. Let d_T(B) be its number of bridges in G', and x_B be the number of edges connecting it to the removed vertices {v1, v2, v3}.")

    print("\nStep 6: Maximize L by creating as many leaves as possible.")
    print("A block B is a leaf if d_T(B) = 1 (or 0 for an isolated component).")
    print("For a leaf block B with d_T(B) = 1, the inequality from Step 4 becomes: 1 + x_B >= 2, which implies x_B >= 1.")

    print("With a total budget of 3d + 2 connections, we can create a maximum of L_max = (3d + 2) / 1 = 3d + 2 leaves.")
    print("This maximum is achievable by constructing a graph G where G' has a star-like condensation graph, confirming this is the correct worst case.")
    
    print("\nStep 7: Calculate the final number of edges to add.")
    print("Using the formula from Step 2 with L = L_max = 3d + 2:")
