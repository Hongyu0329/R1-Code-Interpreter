def solve_graph_arboricity_problem():
    """
    This function provides the solution to the graph arboricity problem.
    The reasoning is as follows:

    Case c=1: The sampling probability is p_u = 1/d_u.
    The expected number of edges in any sampled subgraph is at most its
    expected number of vertices. This strong sparsity condition implies that
    the arboricity is bounded by a constant, O(1), with high probability.
    This corresponds to category 1.

    Case c=2: The sampling probability is p_u = 1/d_u^2.
    A worst-case graph construction involving a disjoint clique of size
    A = Theta(log(n)/log(log(n))) shows that the arboricity can be at least
    Omega(A) with probability >= 1/n. This function grows faster than
    sqrt(log n) but slower than log n.
    This corresponds to category 4.
