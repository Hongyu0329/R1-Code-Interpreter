1. **The Regress Problem of Justification**: The requirement for justification creates a potential infinite regress. For a belief to be justified, its justification must also be justified, leading to a chain (P is justified by Q, Q by R, etc.) that must either go on forever, circle back on itself, or stop at an arbitrary, unjustified belief. The JTB framework does not solve this problem.
2. **The Fallibility and Vagueness of Justification**: The JTB model does not specify what level or type of justification is sufficient for knowledge, making the condition vague (e.g., the lottery paradox). Furthermore, because justification and truth are independent, a belief can be justified but false. This means justification is not a reliable guide to truth, and the connection between our evidence and reality can seem coincidental.
