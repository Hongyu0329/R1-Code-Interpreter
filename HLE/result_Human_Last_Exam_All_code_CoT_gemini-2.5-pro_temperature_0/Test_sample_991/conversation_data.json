    "This is a classic pictographic riddle. My plan is to break down the riddle's description into components that correspond to parts of a Chinese character. I will then assemble these parts to form the final character and use a Python script to print the step-by-step explanation and the resulting character.\n\n1.  **\"A wooden stick\"**: This directly refers to the Chinese character for wood or tree, which is **木** (mù).\n2.  **\"hanging a square box\"**: This describes adding a square shape, **口** (kǒu), on top of the wooden stick.\n3.  **\"a ladder placed in the center\"**: This is a creative description of the cross **十** (shí) inside the square box. A box (口) with a cross inside (十) forms the character for a field, **田** (tián).\n4.  **Assembly**: By placing the \"box with a ladder\" (**田**) on top of the \"wooden stick\" (**木**), we form the complete character **果** (guǒ).\n\nThe Python code below will print this breakdown.\n\n```python\ndef solve_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the Chinese character riddle by breaking it down into its components.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"This is a pictographic riddle. Let's break down the clues to find the Chinese character:\")\n    print(\"1. 'A wooden stick' refers to the character for wood: 木\")\n    print(\"2.
