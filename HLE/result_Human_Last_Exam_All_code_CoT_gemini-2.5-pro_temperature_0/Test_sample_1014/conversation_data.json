    "To find the largest prime divisor of 8139881, I will perform prime factorization on the number. Here is the plan:\n\n1.  **Initialization**: Start with the number `n = 8139881` and an empty list to store its prime factors.\n2.  **Trial Division**: I will use the trial division method to find the prime factors.\n    *   First, I'll handle the smallest prime, 2, by repeatedly dividing `n` by 2 until it's no longer even and adding 2 to our list of factors for each successful division.\n    *   Next, I'll iterate through odd numbers `d` (3, 5, 7, ...) up to the square root of the remaining `n`.\n    *   For each `d`, I'll check if it divides `n`. If it does, I'll add `d` to the list of factors and update `n` by dividing it by `d`. I'll repeat this until `n` is no longer divisible by `d`.\n3.  **Final Factor**: After the loop, if the value of `n` is still greater than 1, this remaining `n` is a prime factor itself and will be added to the list.\n4.  **Output**: Once the list of all prime factors is complete, I will construct the factorization equation as requested. Then, I will find and print the largest value from this list, which is the answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef find_largest_prime_divisor():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the largest prime divisor of a given number and prints the\n    factorization equation.\n    \"\"\"\n    num = 8139881\n    n = num\n    factors = []\n\n    # Handle division by 2\n    while n % 2 == 0:\n        factors.append(2)\n        n //= 2\n\n    # Handle division by odd numbers starting from 3\n    i = 3\n    while i * i <= n:\n        while n % i == 0:\n            factors.append(i)\n            n //= i\n        i += 2\n\n    # If n is a prime number greater than 2, it's the last factor\n    if n > 2:\n        factors.append(n)\n\n    # If the number was prime initially, its only factor is itself\n    if not factors:\n        factors.append(num)\n\n    # Print the factorization equation\n    equation_str = f\"{num} = \" + \" * \".join(map(str, factors))\n    print(equation_str)\n\n    # Find and print the largest prime factor\n    largest_prime = max(factors)\n    print(f\"The largest prime divisor of {num} is: {largest_prime}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    find_largest_prime_divisor()\n```\n<<<62137>>>"
