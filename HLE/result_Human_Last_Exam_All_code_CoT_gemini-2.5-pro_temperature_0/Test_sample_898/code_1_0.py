def solve_quantum_logic_problem():
    """
    This script analyzes the provided logic statements from the viewpoint of quantum logic.

    The problem defines three propositions:
    a: The particle's momentum is in [0, +1/6].
    b: The particle's position is in [-1, 1].
    c: The particle's position is in [-1, 3].

    Key Insight:
    In quantum mechanics, position and momentum are non-commuting observables.
    Quantum logic differs from classical logic primarily in that the distributive law
    is not universally true for non-commuting observables.

    The Distributive Law: p AND (q OR r) <-> (p AND q) OR (p AND r)

    Let's analyze the given options to see which one relates to this principle.

    # Analysis of Option C: (NOT(a AND b) -> (a AND c)) <-> (a AND (b OR c))
    # Let's simplify the left-hand side (LHS) of the equivalence.
    # The rule for implication is: (P -> Q) is equivalent to (NOT P OR Q).
    # So, (NOT(a AND b) -> (a AND c)) becomes (NOT(NOT(a AND b)) OR (a AND c)).
    # The double negation cancels out, leaving: (a AND b) OR (a AND c).
