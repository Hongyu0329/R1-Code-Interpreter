    explanation = """
In nonstandard analysis, the concept of continuity of a function f: X -> Y at a point is defined by how the function acts on points that are infinitesimally close.

1.  **Standard Definition of Continuity**: A function f is continuous at a point x_0 if for any open neighborhood V of f(x_0), there is an open neighborhood U of x_0 such that f(U) is a subset of V. The function is continuous if it is continuous at every point in its domain.

2.  **Nonstandard Analysis Equivalence**:
    - A point x_1 in the nonstandard extension X* is infinitesimally close to a standard point x_0 in X (written x_1 ~ x_0) if x_1 belongs to every standard open neighborhood of x_0. The set of all such x_1 is the monad of x_0.
    - The nonstandard criterion for continuity states that a standard function f is continuous at a standard point x_0 if and only if it maps the monad of x_0 into the monad of f(x_0).
    - For f to be continuous on the entire space X, this must hold for all standard points x_0 in X.

3.  **Analyzing the Options**:
    - **A. ∀ x_0, x_1 ∈ X: x_0 ~ x_1 ⇒ f(x_0) ~ f(x_1)**: This only considers standard points. For standard points in a Hausdorff space, x_0 ~ x_1 implies x_0 = x_1, making the statement trivially true for any function. It does not capture continuity.
    - **B. ∀ x_0 ∈ X, ∀ x_1 ∈ X*: x_0 ~ x_1 ⇒ f(x_0) ~ f(x_1)**: This says that for any standard point x_0, if a (possibly nonstandard) point x_1 is infinitesimally close to x_0, then their images are also infinitesimally close. This is the precise nonstandard characterization of f being continuous at every point in its domain X.
    - **C. ∀ x_0, x_1 ∈ X*: x_0 ~ x_1 ⇒ f(x_0) ~ f(x_1)**: This is a stronger condition, requiring the property to hold for any pair of infinitesimally close points, even if both are nonstandard. This is the nonstandard definition of *uniform continuity*. Since continuity is a weaker property than uniform continuity, this option is not equivalent.
    - **D, E, F**: These are converses of the first three options and relate to other properties like injectivity or being a uniform embedding, not continuity.

4.  **Conclusion**: The property that is equivalent to f being a continuous map is B.
