    This function calculates the value of K based on the analysis of the tensor's slice rank.

    The slice rank of the tensor T_n(x,y,z) = product_{i=1 to n}(x_i + y_i + z_i) - 1
    has the same asymptotic behavior as the slice rank of W_n(x,y,z) = product_{i=1 to n}(x_i + y_i + z_i).

    The slice rank of W_n can be shown to be exactly 2^n.
    This is established by finding a matching upper bound and lower bound.
    - Upper bound: Expanding the product gives 2^n slice terms, so SR(W_n) <= 2^n.
    - Lower bound: Using Fourier analysis, one can show that the dimension of the space
      spanned by the slices is 2^n, so SR(W_n) >= 2^n.

    Therefore, the asymptotic base of the slice rank is C = 2.

    The problem states the slice rank is of the form (3 / 2^K)^n * exp(o(n)).
    By equating the asymptotic bases, we get the equation:
    2 = 3 / 2^K

    Solving for K:
    2 * 2^K = 3
    2^(K+1) = 3
    K + 1 = log2(3)
    K = log2(3) - 1 = log2(3/2)
