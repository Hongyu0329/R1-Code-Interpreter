    "Here is a plan to solve the problem:\n1.  Let the given tensor be $T_n(x, y, z) = \\prod_{i=1}^n (x_i + y_i + z_i) - 1$. Let $W_n(x, y, z) = \\prod_{i=1}^n (x_i + y_i + z_i)$. The tensor $T_n$ is obtained from $W_n$ by subtracting the constant-one tensor $J(x,y,z)=1$. The slice rank of $J$ is 1. Using the property $SR(A+B) \\le SR(A) + SR(B)$, we have $SR(W_n) - 1 \\le SR(T_n) \\le SR(W_n) + 1$. This means that the asymptotic behavior of the slice rank of $T_n$ and $W_n$ is the same. We will therefore find the slice rank of $W_n$.\n\n2.  We will find the slice rank of $W_n$ by establishing a lower bound and an upper bound. The slice rank of a tensor is the minimum of its slice ranks with respect to each of the three variables (x, y, z). We will focus on the x-slice rank.\n\n3.  **Upper Bound:** We can expand the polynomial for $W_n$ by treating $(y_i+z_i)$ as a single term.\n    $W_n(x, y, z) = \\prod_{i=1}^n (x_i + (y_i+z_i)) = \\sum_{S \\subseteq \\{1,..,n\\}} \\left(\\prod_{i \\in S} x_i\\right) \\left(\\prod_{j \\in \\{1,..,n\\}\\setminus S} (y_j+z_j)\\right)$.\n    This expresses $W_n$ as a sum of $2^n$ terms. Each term is a product of a function of $x$ and a function of $(y, z)$, which is an x-slice. Thus, the x-slice rank is at most $2^n$.\n\n4.  **Lower Bound:** The x-slice rank is at least the dimension of the vector space spanned by the functions $\\{W_n(x, \\cdot, \\cdot)\\}_{x \\in \\{0,1\\}^n}$. We can show that these $2^n$ functions are linearly independent. A standard method is to apply a Fourier transform. The Fourier dual functions $g_a(y,z) = \\sum_{x \\in \\{0,1\\}^n} (-1)^{a \\cdot x} W_n(x,y,z)$ for $a \\in \\{0,1\\}^n$ can be shown to be linearly independent polynomials in variables $y_i, z_i$. Since the Fourier transform is invertible, the original $2^n$ functions must also be linearly independent. This implies the x-slice rank is at least $2^n$.\n\n5.  Combining the upper and lower bounds, the x-slice rank is exactly $2^n$. By symmetry, the y-slice rank and z-slice rank are also $2^n$. The slice rank is the minimum of these, so $SR(W_n) = 2^n$.\n\n6.  The asymptotic base for the slice rank is therefore $C=2$. We are given the formula for the slice rank is $(3/2^K)^n e^{o(n)}$. Equating the bases, we get the equation $2 = 3/2^K$.\n\n7.  We solve this equation for $K$:\n    $2 \\cdot 2^K = 3$\n    $2^{K+1} = 3$\n    $K+1 = \\log_2(3)$\n    $K = \\log_2(3) - 1 = \\log_2(3/2)$.\n\n8.  Finally, we will write a Python script to compute the value of $K$ and print the final equation and the result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_for_k():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the value of K based on the analysis of the tensor's slice rank.\n\n    The slice rank of the tensor T_n(x,y,z) = product_{i=1 to n}(x_i + y_i + z_i) - 1\n    has the same asymptotic behavior as the slice rank of W_n(x,y,z) = product_{i=1 to n}(x_i + y_i + z_i).\n\n    The slice rank of W_n can be shown to be exactly 2^n.\n    This is established by finding a matching upper bound and lower bound.\n    - Upper bound: Expanding the product gives 2^n slice terms, so SR(W_n) <= 2^n.\n    - Lower bound: Using Fourier analysis, one can show that the dimension of the space\n      spanned by the slices is 2^n, so SR(W_n) >= 2^n.\n\n    Therefore, the asymptotic base of the slice rank is C = 2.\n\n    The problem states the slice rank is of the form (3 / 2^K)^n * exp(o(n)).\n    By equating the asymptotic bases, we get the equation:\n    2 = 3 / 2^K\n\n    Solving for K:\n    2 * 2^K = 3\n    2^(K+1) = 3\n    K + 1 = log2(3)\n    K = log2(3) - 1 = log2(3/2)\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The numbers in the final equation are C, 3, and 2 (from 2^K).\n    # We solve for K.\n    C = 2\n    numerator = 3\n    \n    # Calculate K\n    K = math.log2(numerator / C) # K = log2(3/2)\n\n    print(\"The asymptotic base of the slice rank is C = 2.\")\n    print(\"The given formula for the slice rank has an asymptotic base of (3 / 2^K).\")\n    print(\"Equating these gives the final equation:\")\n    \n    # Output the numbers in the final equation as requested.\n    print(f\"Equation: {C} = {numerator} / (2^K)\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nSolving for K:\")\n    print(f\"K = log2({numerator}/{C})\")\n    print(f\"The value of K is: {K}\")\n\nsolve_for_k()\n```\n<<<1.584962500721156 - 1>>>"
