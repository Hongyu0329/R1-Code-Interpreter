    # A diffraction grating is used to create these projections.
    # A 1D grating only disperses light in one direction, which is not enough
    # for a robust tomographic reconstruction.

    # A 2D grating disperses light in two perpendicular directions, creating a
    # 2D grid of projections on the sensor. This provides the necessary data.
    # A 2D grating can be fabricated as a single physical component.

    print("\nExplanation:")
    print("1. The technique described is Computed Tomographic Imaging Spectrometry (CTIS), which captures a 3D spectral data cube (x, y, wavelength) on a 2D sensor.")
    print("2. To reconstruct a 3D volume from 2D projections, the projections must be taken from multiple different angles.")
    print("3. In CTIS, a diffraction grating creates these projections. A 2D 'crossed' grating is needed to disperse light in two dimensions, creating a grid of projections with sufficient angular diversity for reconstruction.")
