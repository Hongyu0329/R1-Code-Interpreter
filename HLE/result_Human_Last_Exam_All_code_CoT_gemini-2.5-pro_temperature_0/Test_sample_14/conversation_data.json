    "My plan is to identify the flying units from Tier 1 buildings in the game \"Beyond All Reason\" (BAR) that possess a weapon capable of stunning enemies. I will search my knowledge base for T1 air units for both factions (Armada and Cortex) and check their weapon properties. The units that fit these criteria are the gunships: the Armada Owl and the Cortex Locust.\n\nI will then write a Python script that stores the names and descriptions of these units and prints them out in a user-friendly format.\n\n```python\ndef find_bar_t1_stunning_flyers():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies and prints the T1 flying units in the game BAR\n    that have a weapon that can stun enemies.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Data for the T1 flying units that can shoot and stun.\n    # These are the gunships for each faction.\n    units = [\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Owl\",\n            \"faction\": \"Armada\",\n            \"building\": \"T1 Aeroplant\",\n            \"description\": \"A gunship that fires a continuous laser beam, which stuns and damages light ground units.\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Locust\",\n            \"faction\": \"Cortex\",\n            \"building\": \"T1 Air Factory\",\n            \"description\": \"A gunship that uses a stunning laser weapon, effective against ground targets.\"\n        }\n    ]\n\n    print(\"The T1 flying units in BAR that can shoot and stun are:\")\n    for unit in units:\n        print(f\"\\nUnit: {unit['name']}\")\n        print(f\"Faction: {unit['faction']}\")\n        print(f\"Produced from: {unit['building']}\")\n        print(f\"Description: {unit['description']}\")\n\n# Execute the function to print the information.\nfind_bar_t1_stunning_flyers()\n```\n<<<Owl and Locust>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Which flying unit from 1 tier building in BAR can shoot and stun enemy targets? \nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
