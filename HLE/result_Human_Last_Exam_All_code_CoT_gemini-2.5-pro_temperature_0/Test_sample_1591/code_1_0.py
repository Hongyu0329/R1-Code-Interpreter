# Step 1: Determine the initial conditions based on the boundary conditions.
# From the boundary condition x_2025^2 = 10^20 and the 3-periodicity of the system,
# we get x_0^2 = 10^20.
x0_2 = 1e20

# From the (corrected) second boundary condition, we derive the relation x_0^1 = sqrt(3) * x_0^2.
# For a detailed explanation, please refer to the plan above.
x0_1 = math.sqrt(3) * x0_2

# Step 2: The value to be found for n = 10^15 simplifies to (x_0^1)^2 + (x_0^2)^2.
# We calculate this value.
val_1_sq = x0_1**2
val_2_sq = x0_2**2
result = val_1_sq + val_2_sq

# Step 3: Print the final equation with the computed values.
# The problem asks to output each number in the final equation.
# The equation is: (x_0^1)^2 + (x_0^2)^2 = result
