    explanation = """
The primary scientific basis for adding bypass notches in sheet metal stamping is to manage the flow of material during the forming operation.

Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

1.  **Material Flow is Key:** In stamping, a flat sheet of metal is forced into a three-dimensional shape. The material must stretch, compress, and slide into the die cavity.
2.  **Complex Geometries:** Around features like tight corners, small radii, or deep sections, the material flow is complex. If too much material tries to flow into a small area, it has nowhere to go and will compress, leading to defects like wrinkles and folds.
3.  **The Role of Notches:** A "bypass notch" is a cutout in the blank that strategically removes material from an area where it is not needed or where it would cause problems. By removing this excess material, the notch:
    *   Prevents the material from bunching up and wrinkling.
    *   Allows the remaining material to flow more smoothly into the die cavity.
    *   Reduces the restraining forces on the sheet, which can help prevent tearing in other areas.

Therefore, the notches are a crucial tool for controlling and optimizing the inflow of material into the forming cavities, especially around challenging geometric features. This directly corresponds to option D.
