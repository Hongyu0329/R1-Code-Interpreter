    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n1.  **Identify the space**: The space $X$ is a smooth quintic hypersurface in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$. This means it's a complex surface (real dimension 4) defined by a single homogeneous polynomial of degree 5.\n\n2.  **Determine the homotopy groups using standard theorems**:\n    *   By the Lefschetz Hyperplane Theorem, the inclusion $i: X \\hookrightarrow \\mathbb{CP}^3$ induces isomorphisms on homotopy groups $\\pi_k$ for $k < \\dim_{\\mathbb{C}}(X) = 2$. Since $\\mathbb{CP}^3$ is simply connected ($\\pi_1(\\mathbb{CP}^3) = 0$), we have $\\pi_1(X) = 0$.\n    *   Since $X$ is simply connected, the Hurewicz Theorem tells us that $\\pi_2(X) \\cong H_2(X, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n    *   For a simply connected space like $X$, a theorem by J.H.C. Whitehead relates the third homotopy group to homology. The relevant exact sequence is $\\Gamma(\\pi_2(X)) \\to \\pi_3(X) \\to H_3(X) \\to 0$, where $\\Gamma$ is Whitehead's universal quadratic functor.\n    *   We need to compute the homology groups $H_2(X)$ and $H_3(X)$.\n\n3.  **Compute the Betti numbers of X**:\n    *   By PoincarÃ© Duality on the 4-manifold $X$, we have $b_0(X) = b_4(X)$ and $b_1(X) = b_3(X)$.\n    *   Since $\\pi_1(X)=0$, we have $H_1(X)=0$, so $b_1=0$. This implies $b_3=0$.\n    *   Since $X$ is connected, $b_0=1$, which implies $b_4=1$.\n    *   To find $b_2(X)$, we can compute the Euler characteristic $\\chi(X) = b_0 - b_1 + b_2 - b_3 + b_4 = 1 - 0 + b_2 - 0 + 1 = 2 + b_2$.\n    *   The Euler characteristic can be computed via Chern classes. For a hypersurface of degree $d$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^n$, the second Chern class $c_2(X)$ gives $\\chi(X) = \\int_X c_2(TX)$.\n    *   The formula for the Euler characteristic of a degree $d$ hypersurface in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$ is $\\chi(X) = d(d^2 - 4d + 6)$. For our quintic ($d=5$), this gives $\\chi(X) = 5(25 - 20 + 6) = 5(11) = 55$.\n    *   Equating the two expressions for $\\chi(X)$, we get $2 + b_2 = 55$, which means $b_2 = 53$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the rank of $\\pi_3(X)$**:\n    *   We have $H_2(X) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^{b_2} = \\mathbb{Z}^{53}$ (since $H_1(X)=0$, $H_2(X)$ is torsion-free).\n    *   So, $\\pi_2(X) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^{53}$.\n    *   We have $H_3(X)=0$ (since $b_3=0$).\n    *   Whitehead's exact sequence becomes $\\Gamma(\\mathbb{Z}^{53}) \\to \\pi_3(X) \\to 0$, which means $\\pi_3(X)$ is a quotient of $\\Gamma(\\mathbb{Z}^{53})$. In fact, the sequence can be refined to show $\\pi_3(X) \\cong \\Gamma(\\pi_2(X))$ when $H_3(X)=0$.\n    *   The group $\\Gamma(\\mathbb{Z}^n)$ is a free abelian group, and its rank is given by the formula $n(n-1)/2$.\n    *   Therefore, the rank of $\\pi_3(X)$ is the rank of $\\Gamma(\\mathbb{Z}^{53})$, which is $53 \\times (53-1) / 2$.\n\nNow, let's perform the final calculation using Python.\n\n```python\n# Let X be a smooth quintic hypersurface in CP^3.\n# We want to find the rank of the third homotopy group pi_3(X).\n\n# Step 1: Define the parameters of the hypersurface.\n# d is the degree of the hypersurface.\nd = 5\n# n is the dimension of the ambient complex projective space CP^n.\nn = 3\n\n# Step 2: Use topological properties to find the Betti numbers of X.\n# b_k = rank(H_k(X)).\n# By the Lefschetz Hyperplane Theorem, pi_1(X) = 0, so H_1(X) = 0 and b_1 = 0.\nb1 = 0\n# X is a compact orientable 4-manifold (complex dimension 2).\n# By Poincare Duality, b_3 = b_1 = 0.\nb3 = 0\n# X is connected, so b_0 = 1.\nb0 = 1\n# By Poincare Duality, b_4 = b_0 = 1.\nb4 = 1\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the second Betti number, b_2, using the Euler characteristic.\n# The Euler characteristic chi(X) is given by the sum of Betti numbers:\n# chi(X) = b_0 - b_1 + b_2 - b_3 + b_4 = 1 - 0 + b_2 - 0 + 1 = 2 + b_2.\n# The Euler characteristic can also be computed from the degree d using the formula:\n# chi(X) = d * (d^2 - (n+1)*d + (n+1)*n/2 + 1)\n# For n=3, this simplifies to chi(X) = d * (d^2 - 4*d + 6).\nchi = d * (d**2 - 4*d + 6)\n# Now we can solve for b_2: b_2 = chi - 2.\nb2 = chi - 2\n\nprint(f\"The Euler characteristic of X is chi(X) = {d} * ({d**2} - 4*{d} + 6) = {chi}.\")\nprint(f\"The second Betti number is b_2 = chi(X) - 2 = {chi} - 2 = {b2}.\")\n\n# Step 4: Relate the Betti numbers to homotopy groups.\n# Since pi_1(X) = 0, the Hurewicz theorem states pi_2(X) is isomorphic to H_2(X).\n# The rank of pi_2(X) is therefore b_2.\nrank_pi2 = b2\n\n# Step 5: Calculate the rank of pi_3(X).\n# For a simply connected space X, Whitehead's theorem states that if H_3(X) = 0 (which is true as b_3=0),\n# then pi_3(X) is isomorphic to Gamma(pi_2(X)), where Gamma is Whitehead's universal quadratic functor.\n# The rank of Gamma(Z^k) is given by the formula k * (k - 1) / 2.\nk = rank_pi2\nrank_pi3 = k * (k - 1) // 2\n\nprint(f\"\\nThe rank of pi_2(X) is {k}.\")\nprint(f\"The rank of pi_3(X) is given by the formula rank(Gamma(Z^k)) = k * (k - 1) / 2.\")\nprint(f\"Rank(pi_3(X)) = {k} * ({k} - 1) / 2 = {k} * {k-1} / 2 = {rank_pi3}\")\n\n```\n<<<1378>>>"
