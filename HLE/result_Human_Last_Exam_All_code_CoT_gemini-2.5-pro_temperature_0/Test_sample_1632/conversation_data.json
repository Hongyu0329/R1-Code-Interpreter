    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Problem**: The task is to find the number of self-avoiding walks of length 10 on a 2D square grid (Manhattan lattice). A self-avoiding walk is a path on the grid that never visits the same point more than once.\n\n2.  **Choose an Algorithm**: This is a classic combinatorial counting problem. For a relatively small number of steps like 10, we can use a method called **backtracking search**. This algorithm will explore every possible path of length 10 from a starting point, step by step.\n\n3.  **Implement the Backtracking Algorithm**:\n    *   I will create a recursive function, let's call it `count_walks`.\n    *   This function will take the number of steps remaining, the current position on the grid, and a set of already visited points as input.\n    *   The base case for the recursion is when there are no steps left. In this case, we have found one valid walk, so the function returns 1.\n    *   In the recursive step, the function will try to move to each of the four neighbors (up, down, left, right).\n    *   Before making a move, it checks if the neighbor has already been visited. If it has, that path is discarded (this is the \"self-avoiding\" part).\n    *   If the neighbor is a valid next step, the function calls itself for the new position with one less step remaining.\n    *   The function sums the results from all valid moves to get the total count of walks from the current state.\n\n4.  **Optimization**: A simple 2D grid has rotational symmetry. The number of walks starting with a step to the right is the same as starting up, left, or down. I can calculate the number of walks for just one initial direction (e.g., right) and multiply the result by 4. This reduces the total computation significantly.\n\n5.  **Final Output**: The script will execute the plan and print the final equation, showing how the total number was calculated.\n\nHere is the Python code to solve the problem:\n\n```python\ndef solve_self_avoiding_walks():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates a(n), the number of n-step self-avoiding walks on a \n    Manhattan (2D square) lattice.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = 10\n\n    def count_walks_recursive(steps_left, current_pos, visited):\n        \"\"\"\n        Recursively counts the number of self-avoiding walks from a given state.\n\n        Args:\n            steps_left: The number of steps remaining in the walk.\n            current_pos: The current (x, y) coordinates on the lattice.\n            visited: A set of (x, y) tuples representing visited points.\n\n        Returns:\n            The number of valid self-avoiding walks from the current state.\n        \"\"\"\n        # Base case: If no steps are left, we have successfully found one complete walk.\n        if steps_left == 0:\n            return 1\n\n        count = 0\n        x, y = current_pos\n\n        # Explore the four neighbors: up, down, right, left.\n        for dx, dy in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:\n            next_pos = (x + dx, y + dy)\n\n            # If the neighbor has not been visited, proceed with the walk.\n            if next_pos not in visited:\n                # Mark the neighbor as visited for the subsequent recursive calls.\n                visited.add(next_pos)\n                # Recursively call the function for the next step.\n                count += count_walks_recursive(steps_left - 1, next_pos, visited)\n                # Backtrack: Un-mark the neighbor as visited to explore other paths.\n                visited.remove(next_pos)\n        \n        return count\n\n    # A walk of 0 steps is just the starting point, so there's 1 such walk.\n    if n == 0:\n        result = 1\n        print(f\"a(0) = {result}\")\n        return\n\n    # Start the walk at the origin (0, 0).\n    start_pos = (0, 0)\n    \n    # Optimization: Exploit the symmetry of the grid.
