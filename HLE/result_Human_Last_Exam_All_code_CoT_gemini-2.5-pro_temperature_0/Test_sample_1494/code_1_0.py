# The decay of the squared L2 norm of the horizontal derivative of density is found to be proportional to t^(-3/2).
# We are interested in the decay of the L2 norm itself, which is the square root of the decay of the squared norm.
# So, the decay of ||d_x rho(t)||_L2 is proportional to (t^(-3/2))^(1/2) = t^(-3/4).
# The question asks for the time-decay rate, which is the exponent alpha in t^(-alpha).
