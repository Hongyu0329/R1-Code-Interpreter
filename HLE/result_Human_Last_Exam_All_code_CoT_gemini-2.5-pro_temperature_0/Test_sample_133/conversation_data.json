    "To find the optimal moves for 'O' to win as fast as possible, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Represent the Board**: I will first parse the game state into a 6x7 grid, which is a standard representation for Connect 4.\n2.  **Define the Goal**: The goal is to find the move for 'O' that leads to a win in the minimum number of turns.\n3.  **Analyze Winning Moves**:\n    *   First, I will check if 'O' can win in a single move (a \"win in 1\"). This involves checking if placing an 'O' in any valid column results in four 'O's in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).\n    *   If there's no immediate win, I will search for a move that guarantees a win on the subsequent turn (a \"win in 2\"). This typically involves creating a \"fork\" or a double threat, where 'O' creates two different lines of three, which the opponent ('X') cannot block simultaneously.\n4.  **Evaluate Candidate Moves**: I will systematically check each possible move for 'O'.\n    *   For each move, I'll simulate placing an 'O' in that column.\n    *   Then, I'll analyze the new board state to see if it constitutes a forced win. A move is a forced win if, for every possible counter-move by 'X', 'O' has a winning move on the next turn.\n5.  **Code Implementation**: I will write a Python script to automate this analysis. The script will:\n    *   Set up the initial board.\n    *   Contain functions to check for valid moves and winning conditions.\n    *   Iterate through all possible moves for 'O' and apply the logic described above to find the move(s) that secure the fastest win.\n    *   Print the name of the optimal move(s) in the format `column_letter` + `row_number`.\n\nBased on my analysis, there is a move that creates an unblockable horizontal threat, guaranteeing a win for 'O' in their next turn. The following Python code will programmatically find this move.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Constants\nROWS = 6\nCOLS = 7\nPLAYER_O = 'O'\nPLAYER_X = 'X'\nEMPTY = '.'\n\ndef create_board():\n    \"\"\"Creates the initial board state for the problem.\"\"\"\n    board = np.full((ROWS, COLS), EMPTY)\n    # The board is represented with row 0 at the top and row 5 at the bottom.\n    # The user's board is 1-indexed from the top.\n    # Row 6 in the prompt corresponds to index 5 here.\n    board[5] = ['X', 'O', 'O', 'X', 'X', 'O', 'X']\n    # Row 5 in the prompt corresponds to index 4 here.\n    board[4] = ['O', '.', 'X', 'O', 'X', 'X', 'X']\n    # Row 4 in the prompt corresponds to index 3 here.\n    board[3] = ['.', '.', '.', 'O', 'O', '.', '.']\n    return board\n\ndef is_valid_location(board, col):\n    \"\"\"Checks if a column is not full.\"\"\"\n    return board[0][col] == EMPTY\n\ndef get_next_open_row(board, col):\n    \"\"\"Gets the row a piece will fall to in a column.\"\"\"\n    for r in range(ROWS -
