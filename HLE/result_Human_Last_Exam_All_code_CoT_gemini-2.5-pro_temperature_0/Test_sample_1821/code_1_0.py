def solve_tree_cardinality():
    """
    This function calculates the number of cardinalities in the specified interval.
    
    Based on the problem's constraints, we can deduce the following:
    1. The condition that every level of the tree has a countable cardinality ($\aleph_0$) imposes a strong structural constraint, especially at limit ordinal levels.
    2. For any limit ordinal $\lambda < \omega_2$, the set of nodes at that level, Lev_λ(T), must be identifiable with the set of branches of the tree truncated at λ, [T|λ].
    3. This implies that for any limit λ < ω_2, the tree T|λ has countably many branches (|[T|λ]| = ℵ₀).
    4. Using Fodor's Pressing Down Lemma, we can show that this condition forces all "splitting" in the tree to occur below a fixed ordinal level β* < ω_2.
    5. This means the total number of branches in the entire tree is determined by the number of branches in the initial segment T|β*.
    6. The number of branches of T|β* is shown to be ℵ₀.
    7. Therefore, any tree satisfying the given conditions must have exactly ℵ₀ branches.
