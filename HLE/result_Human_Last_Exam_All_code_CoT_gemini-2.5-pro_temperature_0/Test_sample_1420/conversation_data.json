    "To determine the scaling exponent α for the specific heat in a system with spatial dimension d=3 using the epsilon expansion, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the theoretical framework:** The problem is situated within the renormalization group theory, specifically using the epsilon (ϵ) expansion for the O(N) model, which describes a wide class of critical phenomena.\n2.  **Define the expansion parameter ϵ:** The expansion is performed around the upper critical dimension, `d_c`. For the O(N) model, `d_c = 4`. The parameter ϵ is defined as `ϵ = d_c - d`.\n3.  **State the formula for α:** The specific heat exponent α, to the first order in ϵ, is given by the formula: `α = (4 - N) / (2 * (N + 8)) * ϵ`. Here, N is the number of components of the order parameter.\n4.  **Choose a value for N:** Since the problem does not specify the universality class (i.e., the value of N), we will use the most common case, the Ising model, for which `N = 1`.\n5.  **Calculate the result:** We will substitute `d=3`, `d_c=4`, and `N=1` into the formulas to compute the value of α.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef calculate_specific_heat_exponent():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the specific heat scaling exponent alpha using the epsilon expansion.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
