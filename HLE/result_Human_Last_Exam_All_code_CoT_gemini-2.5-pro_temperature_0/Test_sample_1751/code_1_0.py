    # Define the lipids
    dihydroceramide = "C16-dihydroceramide (d18:0/16:0)"
    ceramide = "C16-ceramide (d18:1/16:0)"

    # Step-by-step explanation

    1.  Analyze the structure of each lipid:
        -   {dihydroceramide}: This molecule's hydrocarbon chains (both the d18:0 sphingoid base and the 16:0 fatty acid) are fully saturated. They contain no double bonds.
        -   {ceramide}: This molecule contains one trans double bond in its d18:1 sphingoid base.

    2.  Relate structure to molecular packing:
        -   Saturated chains are straight and flexible, allowing them to pack together very tightly and efficiently. This maximizes the attractive van der Waals forces between chains, leading to a dense, highly ordered state.
        -   The trans double bond in the ceramide introduces a point of rigidity and a slight kink in the hydrocarbon chain. This disruption prevents the molecules from packing as closely together as the fully saturated dihydroceramide. This leads to a less dense, less ordered state.

    3.  Connect packing to surface area:
        -   Tighter packing means that a given number of molecules will occupy a smaller total area.
        -   Since {dihydroceramide} can pack more tightly due to its fully saturated chains, it will have a lower surface area per molecule when compressed in a monolayer.

    Conclusion:
    The lipid that will have a lower surface area is the one that can pack more densely.
