    # The experiment compares antibody binding in two conditions:
    # 1. Control (PBS buffer)
    # 2. Inhibitor (500 mM GalNAc)

    # The conclusion is that GalNAc inhibits the antibody.
    # A critical assumption is that the inhibitor does not affect the target protein's availability.

    # Let's analyze the choices based on standard experimental principles.

    # When to add the anti-FLAG antibody?
    # The anti-FLAG antibody binds directly to the FLAG-tagged MUC1 protein.
    # This makes it a 'primary' antibody.
    # Primary antibodies are added in the first antibody incubation step.
    # This eliminates choices B and E, which suggest adding it with 'secondary' antibodies.
    when_to_add = "With the primary antibodies"

    # Why add the anti-FLAG antibody?
    # The concentration of the inhibitor, 500 mM GalNAc, is very high.
    # Such a high concentration could cause osmotic stress or other off-target effects on the cells.
    # A plausible off-target effect is the internalization or shedding of surface proteins, including our MUC1 construct.
    # If MUC1 is removed from the surface, the main antibody signal will decrease, but this is an artifact, not inhibition.
    # The anti-FLAG antibody binds to the protein itself, not the sugar. Its binding is unaffected by the GalNAc inhibitor.
    # Therefore, it serves as a perfect control to measure the amount of MUC1 on the cell surface.
    # By checking that the anti-FLAG signal is the same in both PBS and GalNAc conditions, we can be confident
    # that the surface expression of MUC1 has not been altered.
    # This makes "verify GalNAc has not altered surface expression of MUC1" the specific and correct reason.
    why_to_add = "To verify GalNAc has not altered surface expression of MUC1"

    # Combining the 'when' and 'why':
    # The anti-FLAG antibody should be added with the primary antibodies.
    # Its purpose is to verify that GalNAc has not altered the surface expression of MUC1.
    # This corresponds exactly to choice C.
