    This function determines the minimal number of CCZ gates required to
    synthesize a CCCZ gate without ancilla qubits.

    The problem is equivalent to finding the minimal number of Toffoli (C^2-X)
    gates to synthesize a C^3-X gate, as they are related by Hadamard conjugation
    on the target qubit, and arbitrary single-qubit rotations are allowed.

    Based on established results in the quantum circuit synthesis literature,
    the minimal number of Toffoli gates to implement a C^3-X gate without
    ancillas is 6.
