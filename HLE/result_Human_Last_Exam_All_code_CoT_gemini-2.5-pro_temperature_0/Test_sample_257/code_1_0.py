    print("Analysis of Reason (3): Denying equity to drawing hands.")
    print("Denying equity means betting to force an opponent to fold a hand that has a chance to improve and beat you. This is a fundamental component of Expected Value (EV) in poker. A GTO strategy is designed to maximize EV, and part of that calculation involves the probability that your bet makes hands with equity fold. Therefore, denying equity is an integral part of GTO strategy and does NOT disappear.")

    print("In an exploitative game, you bet to see how your opponent reacts to narrow down their hand range. However, in a GTO vs. GTO game, your opponent's response is perfectly balanced. Their calling and raising ranges contain a precise mix of value hands and bluffs, designed to make them unexploitable. You don't gain any 'new' exploitable information because their reaction is already accounted for in the GTO equilibrium. Therefore, betting 'for information' is not a valid concept in pure GTO theory and this reason disappears.")

    print("This reason implies you are trying to hide your strategy or tendencies from your opponent. In a GTO world, your opponent is assumed to already know your complete strategy (e.g., they know exactly how often you bluff with certain hands). Since your strategy is already known and is unexploitable, there is no value in hiding the result of a single hand. You bluff because it is the highest EV action with that hand, not to conceal information. Therefore, this reason also disappears.")
