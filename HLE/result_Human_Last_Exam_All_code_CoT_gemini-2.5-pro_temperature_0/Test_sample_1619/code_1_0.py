    This script simulates the logic of using a CHSH inequality test
    to distinguish between a quantum reality and a classical (dream) reality.

    The CHSH inequality states that for any classical, local-realist theory,
    a specific correlation value 'S' must be less than or equal to 2.
    However, quantum mechanics predicts 'S' can be as high as 2 * sqrt(2).

    A result S > 2 suggests a reality is fundamentally quantum and not a classical simulation.
