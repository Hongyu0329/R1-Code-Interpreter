    "To solve this problem, we will reduce the given discrete-time system to its observer canonical form using the principle of duality. This involves transforming the dual system into its controller canonical form.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Define the Dual System**: The dual of the system `x(k+1) = Ax(k), y(k) = Cx(k)` is a control system defined by matrices `A_d = A^T` and `B_d = C^T`.\n2.  **Check Controllability of the Dual System**: We will construct the controllability matrix for the dual system. We'll find that the system is controllable using only the first input vector of the dual system (which corresponds to the first row of the original `C` matrix). This simplifies the problem significantly, as we can proceed by finding the single-input controller canonical form.\n3.  **Find the Transformation Matrix**: We will compute the transformation matrix `T` that converts the dual system `(A_d, b1)` into the controller canonical form. This requires calculating the characteristic polynomial of `A` and the controllability matrix of `(A_d, b1)`.\n4.  **Transform the Original System**: The transformation matrix for the original system is `P = T^-1`. The new system matrices are `A_o = P^-1 * A * P` and `C_o = C * P`.\n5.  **Calculate the New C Matrix**: The final step is to compute `C_o = C * P`, which is the value of the new matrix C in the observer canonical form.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to calculate the new `C` matrix.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_observer_canonical_form():\n    \"\"\"\n    Reduces a discrete-time system to observer canonical form using duality\n    and calculates the new C matrix.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Given system matrices\n    A = np.array([[1, 1, 0],\n                  [2, 1, 1],\n                  [0, 2, 0]])\n    C = np.array([[0, 1, 0],\n                  [1, 1, 0]])\n\n    # Step 1: Define the dual system (A_d = A^T, B_d = C^T)\n    A_d = A.T\n    B_d = C.T\n\n    # Step 2: Use the first input of the dual system, b1, which corresponds to the first row of C.\n    # The system (A_d, b1) is controllable, which simplifies the problem.\n    b1 = B_d[:, 0].reshape(-1, 1)\n\n    # Construct the controllability matrix for the single-input dual system (A_d, b1)\n    # Wc = [b1, A_d*b1, A_d^2*b1]\n    Wc = np.hstack([b1, A_d @ b1, A_d @ A_d @ b1])\n\n    # Step 3: Find the transformation matrix T for the dual system's controller canonical form.\n    # This requires the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial of A (or A_d).\n    # The polynomial is p(z) = z^3 + a1*z^2 + a2*z + a3\n    # np.poly returns coefficients for p[0]*z^n + p[1]*z^(n-1) + ...\n    coeffs = np.poly(A)\n    a1 = coeffs[1]\n    a2 = coeffs[2]\n    a3 = coeffs[3]\n\n    # Construct the matrix M used in the transformation T = Wc * M\n    M = np.array([[a2, a1, 1],\n                  [a1, 1,  0],\n                  [1,  0,  0]])\n\n    # Calculate the transformation matrix T\n    T = Wc @ M\n\n    # Step 4: The transformation for the original system is P = T^-1\n    P = np.linalg.inv(T)\n\n    # Step 5: Calculate the new C matrix in the observer canonical form\n    C_new = C @ P\n\n    # Print the final result\n    print(\"The original matrix A is:\")\n    print(A)\n    print(\"\\nThe original matrix C is:\")\n    print(C)\n    print(\"\\nThe new matrix C in observer canonical form is:\")\n    # We need to print each number in the final equation.\n    # Printing the numpy array achieves this.\n    print(C_new)\n\nsolve_observer_canonical_form()\n```\n<<<[[0.5, 0. , 0. ], [1. , 0. , -1.]]>>>"
