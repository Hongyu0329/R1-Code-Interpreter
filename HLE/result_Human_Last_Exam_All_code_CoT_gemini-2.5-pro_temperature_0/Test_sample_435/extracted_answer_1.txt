Interleukin-15 would be predicted to increase cytokine release in CAR T cells compared to T cells manufactured without it. This is because IL-15 promotes the development of a more persistent and functionally potent memory T cell phenotype, which mounts a more robust response, including greater cytokine secretion, upon antigen stimulation.
