def solve_for_d():
    """
    This function solves for the integer 'd' based on the condition that the map 'g'
    is a permutation on the set of vertices.

    Definitions:
    - The number of vertices is n.
    - The vertices are indexed from 0 to n-1, i.e., {0, 1, ..., n-1}.
    - The map g acts on a vertex i as g(i) = n - d - i.

    For g to be a permutation, the set of image vertices {g(0), ..., g(n-1)}
    must be the same as the set of vertices {0, ..., n-1}.

    The image set is {n-d, n-d-1, ..., 1-d}.
    The vertex set is {n-1, n-2, ..., 0}.

    Equating the minimum and maximum elements of these sets gives us two equations:
    1) min(image_set) = min(vertex_set) => 1 - d = 0
    2) max(image_set) = max(vertex_set) => n - d = n - 1

    Both equations must hold and should yield the same value for d.
