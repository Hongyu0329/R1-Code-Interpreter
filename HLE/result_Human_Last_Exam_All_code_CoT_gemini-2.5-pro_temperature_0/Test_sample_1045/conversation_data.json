    "To determine the total number of contracted Gaussian functions for a toluene (C7H8) molecule with a 6-31G basis set, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the number of each type of atom** in the molecule. Toluene (C7H8) has 7 Carbon (C) atoms and 8 Hydrogen (H) atoms.\n2.  **Determine the number of contracted basis functions for each atom type** in the 6-31G basis set.\n    *   **For each Hydrogen (H) atom:** The 6-31G basis set uses 2 contracted functions (one for the inner part of the valence shell, one for the outer part).\n    *   **For each Carbon (C) atom:** The 6-31G basis set uses 9 contracted functions (1 for the core 1s orbital, and 4 for the inner valence + 4 for the outer valence s and p orbitals).\n3.  **Calculate the total number of functions** by multiplying the count of each atom by its number of basis functions and summing the results.\n\nThe following Python code will perform this calculation and print the final equation.\n\n```python\n# Number of atoms in toluene (C7H8)\nnum_carbon_atoms = 7\nnum_hydrogen_atoms = 8\n\n# Number of contracted Gaussian functions per atom for the 6-31G basis set\nfunctions_per_carbon = 9  # 1s (core) + 2s (split) + 2p (split) -> 1 + 2 + (2*3) = 9\nfunctions_per_hydrogen = 2 # 1s (split) -> 2\n\n# Calculate the total number of functions for each element\ntotal_functions_carbon = num_carbon_atoms * functions_per_carbon\ntotal_functions_hydrogen = num_hydrogen_atoms * functions_per_hydrogen\n\n# Calculate the grand total for the molecule\ntotal_functions = total_functions_carbon + total_functions_hydrogen\n\n# Print the breakdown of the calculation and the final result\nprint(\"To calculate the total number of contracted Gaussian functions for toluene (C7H8) with a 6-31G basis set:\")\nprint(f\"1.

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    For a 6-31G basis set calculation of toluene, C7H8, how many contracted Gaussian functions are used\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
