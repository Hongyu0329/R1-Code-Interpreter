    "To determine the number of non-zero Christoffel symbols for the spacetime outside a spherically symmetric body, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the Metric:** The geometry of spacetime outside a spherically symmetric, non-rotating, uncharged body of mass $M$ is described by the Schwarzschild metric.\n\n2.  **Define the Metric Tensor:** In spherical coordinates $(x^0, x^1, x^2, x^3) = (t, r, \\theta, \\phi)$ and using natural units where the gravitational constant $G$ and the speed of light $c$ are set to 1, the metric tensor $g_{\\mu\\nu}$ is a diagonal matrix with the following components:\n    *   $g_{00} = -\\left(1 - \\frac{2M}{r}\\right)$\n    *   $g_{11} = \\left(1 - \\frac{2M}{r}\\right)^{-1}$\n    *   $g_{22} = r^2$\n    *   $g_{33} = r^2 \\sin^2\\theta$\n\n3.  **Use the Christoffel Symbol Formula:** The Christoffel symbols of the second kind, $\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^\\rho$, are calculated using the formula:\n    $\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^\\rho = \\frac{1}{2} g^{\\rho\\sigma} \\left( \\frac{\\partial g_{\\sigma\\mu}}{\\partial x^\\nu} + \\frac{\\partial g_{\\sigma\\nu}}{\\partial x^\\mu} - \\frac{\\partial g_{\\mu\\nu}}{\\partial x^\\sigma} \\right)$\n    where $g^{\\rho\\sigma}$ is the inverse metric tensor.\n\n4.  **Automate with Python:** Since calculating all $4 \\times 4 \\times 4 = 64$ symbols by hand is tedious and prone to error, we will use a Python script with the `sympy` library for symbolic mathematics. The script will:\n    a. Define the coordinates and the metric tensor symbolically.\n    b. Calculate the inverse metric tensor.\n    c. Iterate through all indices $(\\rho, \\mu, \\nu)$ and compute each Christoffel symbol using the formula.\n    d. Simplify the resulting expressions.\n    e. Count how many of these symbols are non-zero.\n    f. Print each non-zero symbol and its calculated expression, followed by the total count.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to find the exact number of non-zero Christoffel symbols.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_christoffel_symbols():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the Christoffel symbols for the Schwarzschild metric\n    and counts the number of non-zero components.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
