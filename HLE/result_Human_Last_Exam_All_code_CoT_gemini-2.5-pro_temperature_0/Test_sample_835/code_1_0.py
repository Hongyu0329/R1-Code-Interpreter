# This script provides the solution to two questions on Biblical Hebrew phonology.
# It identifies and prints the required syllables based on an analysis of the
# Tiberian pronunciation tradition.

# The final answer string is constructed based on the following analysis:
# 1) The primary stressed syllables in the first seven words of Psalm 74:1 are:
#    כִּ֗יל (stress and accent on 'kîl')
#    אָ֫ (stress and accent on 'ʾā')
#    לָ (stress on 'lā', accent is postpositive)
#    הִים (stress on 'hîm', accent is prepositive)
#    נַ֣ח (stress and accent on 'naḥ')
#    נֶ֑ (stress and accent on 'ne')
#    שַׁ֥ן (stress and accent on 'šan')
# 2) The last syllable with marked secondary stress (meteg) in 1 Chronicles 5:10 is:
#    עָֽ (in the word לַגִּלְעָֽד)
# The two parts are joined by a comma without a space.

final_answer = "כִּ֗יל אָ֫ לָ הִים נַ֣ח נֶ֑ שַׁ֥ן,עָֽ"
