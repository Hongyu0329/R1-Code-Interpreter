# This script calculates the derived lower bound 'a'.
# The problem is to find the lower bound of the expression:
# E = (d/dt + (1-2u)u_bar*d/dx) * u_bar
#
# The derivation, as outlined in the steps above, leads to a lower bound
# by analyzing the expression at a point where u_bar attains its minimum.
# The inequality obtained is:
# E_min >= u_bar_min * u(1-u)_max - u_bar_max * K[u(1-u)]_max
#
# We use the following bounds derived from the problem statement:
# u_bar_min >= -1/2
u_bar_min = -1/2

# u_bar_max <= 1/2
u_bar_max = 1/2

# u(1-u)_max = 1/4 (since 0 <= u <= 1)
u_term_max = 1/4

# K[u(1-u)]_max <= K[1/4] = 1/4
K_term_max = 1/4

# The final equation for the lower bound 'a' is:
# a = u_bar_min * u_term_max - u_bar_max * K_term_max
