    Calculates the theoretical completeness bound for the ontology alignment scenario.
    
    In this scenario, the conflict between O₁'s 'mergeable siblings' and O₂'s 'strict
    categorical structure' limits the completeness of the mapping. Statement D posits
    that this completeness is bounded by ln(b)/d, where 'b' is the branching factor
    and 'd' is the depth. This formula reflects how the ability to preserve logical
    constraints (like subsumption) diminishes as the hierarchy gets deeper and the
