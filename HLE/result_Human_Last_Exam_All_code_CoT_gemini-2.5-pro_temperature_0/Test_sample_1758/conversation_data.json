    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the phonological transformation from the English \"shock absorber\" to its likely pronunciation in Puerto Rican Spanish.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Analyze the English pronunciation:** The starting point is the Standard American English pronunciation, which is roughly /ʃɑk əbˈsɔrbər/.\n2.  **Adapt \"shock\":**\n    *   The English \"sh\" sound (/ʃ/) does not exist in Spanish. The most common adaptation is the \"ch\" sound (/tʃ/).\n    *   The English vowel /ɑ/ (as in \"cot\") is closest to the Spanish /o/.\n    *   The final /k/ sound exists in Spanish and is retained.\n    *   This transforms \"shock\" into `[tʃok]`.\n3.  **Adapt \"absorber\":** This requires applying several characteristic rules of Puerto Rican Spanish phonology.\n    *   **Vowels:** Spanish does not have the English schwa sound (/ə/). Unstressed vowels are pronounced fully. So, the 'a' becomes /a/ and the 'e' becomes /e/.\n    *   **Intervocalic /b/:** When a 'b' sound appears between two vowels, it softens from a hard stop [b] to a fricative [β] (a sound made by bringing the lips close but not fully stopping the air). Both 'b's in \"absorber\" are in this position.\n    *   **Lateralization of /r/:** A very distinct feature of Puerto Rican Spanish is changing an /r/ sound to an /l/ sound when it occurs at the end of a syllable (in the coda). The word \"absorber\" syllabifies in Spanish as `ab-sor-ber`. Both the 'r' in `sor` and the final 'r' in `ber` are at the end of their respective syllables, so they both change to an 'l' sound.\n    *   **The /s/ sound:** The /s/ in `ab-sor-ber` is at the beginning of the syllable `sor`. Therefore, it is pronounced as a clear [s] and is not aspirated to [h], a change that only happens to syllable-final /s/.\n4.  **Combine and Finalize:** Putting these steps together, \"shock\" becomes `[tʃok]` and \"absorber\" becomes `[aβsolˈbel]`. The code below will print this final transcription and the reasoning behind it.\n\n```python\ndef transcribe_puerto_rican_spanish():\n    \"\"\"\n    Provides a phonetic transcription of the English term \"shock absorber\"\n    based on the phonological rules of Puerto Rican Spanish.\n    \"\"\"\n    english_term = \"shock absorber\"\n    phonetic_transcription = \"[tʃok aβsolˈbel]\"\n\n    print(f\"English Term: {english_term}\")\n    print(f\"Phonetic Transcription in Puerto Rican Spanish: {phonetic_transcription}\\n\")\n    print(\"--- Phonological Explanation ---\")\n\n    # Explanation for \"shock\" -> [tʃok]\n    print(\"\\n1.
