    This function performs the Knuth-Bendix completion algorithm mentally

    """

    # The Knuth-Bendix completion process generates several new rules.
    # After simplification and inter-reduction, the final set of added rules is determined.
    # The rules are ordered by their left-hand side (LHS) using the
    # lexicographic path ordering with precedence f < g < h.

    # The final added rules are:
    # 1. f(f(x, x), f(y, y)) -> f(x, x)
    # 2. g(x) -> f(x, x)
    # 3. h(x) -> f(x, x)

    # Let's determine the order based on their LHS:
    # LHS 1: f(f(x, x), f(y, y))
    # LHS 2: g(x)
    # LHS 3: h(x)
    #
    # According to LPO with f < g < h:
    # - h(x) > g(x) because h > g.
    # - g(x) > f(f(x, x), f(y, y)) because g > f.
    #
    # So the increasing order of LHS is:
    # f(f(x, x), f(y, y)), g(x), h(x)

    rule3 = "h(x) -> f(x,x)"

    # Print the rules in the correct order, separated by commas.
    print(f"{rule1}, {rule2}, {rule3}")
