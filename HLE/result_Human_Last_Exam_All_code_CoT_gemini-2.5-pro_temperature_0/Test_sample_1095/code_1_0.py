    print("The equation 'k_r(l)^2 ≈ C1 - C2 * l' (where C1 and C2 are constants) shows that k_r^2 must be a linear function of l.")
    print("Therefore, k_r itself must be proportional to the square root of l.")
    print("Final relationship: k_r ∝ sqrt(l)")

    print("\n### Conclusion ###")
    print("Based on the derivation, the condition that the radial wavevector k_r must meet to produce rotational propagation is k_r ∝ sqrt(l).")
