# The riddle's clues point to an idiomatic expression.
# 1. "Smoky cities" vs. "Milan": This suggests something visible in a clear sky but not in a smoggy one, like clouds.
# 2. "did not have enough imagination": This points to seeing shapes or figures that aren't literally there.
# The expression for seeing fanciful things in the sky or having unrealistic dreams is "building castles in the air".
# In a city with polluted air, one cannot see the clouds to imagine castles in them.

# Define the components of the answer
word1 = "Castles"
word2 = "in"
word3 = "the"
word4 = "air"

# As requested, we will output each part of the final answer, like building an equation.
print("The first word of the answer is: " + word1)
print("The second word of the answer is: " + word2)
print("The third word of the answer is: " + word3)
print("The fourth word of the answer is: " + word4)

# Now, we print the final, complete answer.
final_answer = word1 + " " + word2 + " " + word3 + " " + word4
print("\nTherefore, the final answer is:")
print(final_answer)
