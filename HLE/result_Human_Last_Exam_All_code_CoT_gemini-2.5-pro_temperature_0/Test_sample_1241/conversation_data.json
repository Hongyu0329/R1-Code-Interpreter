    "To find the value of $P_{0}(+\\infty) + P_{1}(+\\infty)$, we need to determine the steady-state probabilities of the system. At steady state, as $t \\to +\\infty$, the probabilities $P_i(t)$ become constant, which we denote as $p_i$. This implies that their time derivatives, $P_i'(t)$, become zero.\n\nBy setting all derivatives to zero in the given system of equations, we get a system of linear algebraic equations:\n1.  $0 = -\\lambda_{01}p_{0} + \\lambda_{10}p_{1}$\n2.  $0 = \\lambda_{01}p_{0} - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12})p_{1} + \\lambda_{21}p_{2} + \\lambda_{31}p_{3}$\n3.  $0 = \\lambda_{12}p_{1} - (\\lambda_{21} + \\lambda_{23})p_{2}$\n4.  $0 = \\lambda_{23}p_{2} - \\lambda_{31}p_{3}$\n\nAdditionally, the sum of all probabilities must be 1:\n5.  $p_{0} + p_{1} + p_{2} + p_{3} = 1$\n\nNow, we substitute the given values of $\\lambda_{ij}$:\n$\\lambda_{01} = 0.019, \\lambda_{10} = 0.65, \\lambda_{12} = 0.4, \\lambda_{21} = 0.392, \\lambda_{23} = 0.008, \\lambda_{31} = 0.008$\n\nLet's solve the system:\nFrom equation (4): $0.008 p_2 = 0.008 p_3 \\implies p_2 = p_3$.\nFrom equation (3): $0.4 p_1 = (0.392 + 0.008) p_2 \\implies 0.4 p_1 = 0.4 p_2 \\implies p_1 = p_2$.\nSo, we have $p_1 = p_2 = p_3$.\n\nFrom equation (1): $0.019 p_0 = 0.65 p_1 \\implies p_0 = \\frac{0.65}{0.019} p_1$.\n\nNow, we use the normalization condition (5):\n$p_0 + p_1 + p_2 + p_3 = 1$\n$(\\frac{0.65}{0.019}) p_1 + p_1 + p_1 + p_1 = 1$\n$(\\frac{0.65}{0.019} + 3) p_1 = 1$\n$p_1 = \\frac{1}{\\frac{0.65}{0.019} + 3}$\n\nWe need to find $p_0 + p_1$:\n$p_0 + p_1 = (\\frac{0.65}{0.019}) p_1 + p_1 = (\\frac{0.65}{0.019} + 1) p_1$\nSubstituting the expression for $p_1$:\n$p_0 + p_1 = \\frac{\\frac{0.65}{0.019} + 1}{\\frac{0.65}{0.019} + 3}$\n\nThe following Python code will calculate this value and print the final equation with the numbers and the result.\n\n```python\ndef solve_steady_state_probability():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the sum of steady-state probabilities P0(+inf) + P1(+inf)\n    for the given Kolmogorov-Chepmen system.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Given parameters\n    lambda_01 = 0.019\n    lambda_10 = 0.65\n    \n    # The problem simplifies to solving a system of linear equations for the\n    # steady-state probabilities p_i = P_i(+inf).\n    # The derivation leads to the following expression for p0 + p1:\n    # p0 + p1 = ((lambda_10 / lambda_01) + 1) / ((lambda_10 / lambda_01) + 3)\n\n    # Calculate the ratio lambda_10 / lambda_01\n    ratio = lambda_10 / lambda_01\n\n    # Calculate the final result for p0 + p1\n    result = (ratio + 1) / (ratio + 3)\n\n    # Print the final equation with the numbers and the result\n    print(f\"The final equation for P0(+inf) + P1(+inf) is derived from the steady-state conditions.\")\n    print(f\"The calculation is as follows:\")\n    print(f\"P0(+inf) + P1(+inf) = (({lambda_10} / {lambda_01}) + 1) / (({lambda_10} / {lambda_01}) + 3) = {result}\")\n\nsolve_steady_state_probability()\n```\n<<<0.9462517680056581>>>"
