# The clinical presentation strongly supports a diagnosis of splenic laceration.
# This code will print the reasoning and the final answer.

# Key findings from the case report:
procedure = "Difficult colonoscopy"
pain_location = "Left Upper Quadrant (LUQ) and epigastric pain"
referred_pain = "Left-shoulder discomfort (Kehr's sign)"
initial_hemoglobin = 11.7
later_hemoglobin = 6.5
hemodynamic_status = "Developed tachycardia and hypotension (hemorrhagic shock)"
polypectomy_performed = False

# Analysis:
# 1. The location of pain (LUQ) points to the spleen.
# 2. Left shoulder pain (Kehr's sign) is classic for diaphragmatic irritation from splenic blood.
# 3. The drastic drop in hemoglobin (11.7 to 6.5) and hemodynamic collapse indicate massive internal bleeding, consistent with injury to a highly vascular organ like the spleen.
# 4. Splenic injury is a known, albeit rare, complication of a difficult colonoscopy.
# 5. Other options are less likely:
#    - Colonic perforation typically presents with sepsis/peritonitis, not primarily hemorrhagic shock.
#    - Lower GI bleeding would manifest with blood in the stool.
#    - Postpolypectomy syndrome is ruled out as no polypectomy was performed.
