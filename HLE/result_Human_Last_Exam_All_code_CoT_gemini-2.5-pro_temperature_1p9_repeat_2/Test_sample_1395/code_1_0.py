# The logic to solve the problem is based on established principles of graph theory concerning map coloring.

# Step 1: Establish the chromatic number of the Asian graph before the Soviet dissolution.
# A map of countries is a planar graph. By the Four-Color Theorem, its chromatic number is at most 4.
# A graph of the complexity of the pre-1991 Asian continent is known to require 4 colors.
chi_before = 4
print(f"The chromatic number of the Asian graph before Soviet dissolution (chi_before) was: {chi_before}")

# Step 2: Establish the chromatic number after the dissolution.
# The new map with additional Central Asian countries remains a complex planar graph, still requiring 4 colors.
chi_after = 4
print(f"The chromatic number of the Asian graph after Soviet dissolution (chi_after) is: {chi_after}")

# Step 3: Calculate the incremental change, delta_soviet.
delta_soviet = chi_after - chi_before
print(f"The incremental change delta_soviet is chi_after - chi_before = {chi_after} - {chi_before} = {delta_soviet}.")

# Step 4: Determine if the planarity of the graph changed.
# The political act of dissolving a country is a subdivision of a planar graph.
# The resulting graph remains planar. Thus, planarity did not change.
print("The dissolution of the Soviet Union did not change the planarity of the Asian country graph.")

# Step 5: Assign the value for beta.
# beta is 1 if planarity did not change, and 2 if it did.
beta = 1
print(f"As planarity did not change, beta = {beta}.")

# Step 6: Calculate and print the final result.
final_answer = beta * delta_soviet
print(f"The final answer is beta * delta_soviet = {beta} * {delta_soviet} = {final_answer}")
