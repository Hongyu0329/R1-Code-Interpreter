    "To find the steady-state solution for the given boundary-value problem, we need to find the values of $P_i(t)$ as $t \\to +\\infty$. Let's denote these steady-state probabilities as $p_i = P_i(+\\infty)$. In the steady state, the probabilities are constant, so their time derivatives are zero: $P_i'(t) = 0$ for all $i$.\n\nThe problem statement for the second equation, $P_{1}'(t) = -\\lambda_{01}P_{0}(t) - ...$, appears to have a typo. In the Kolmogorov-Chepman system (which describes continuous-time Markov chains), the rate of flow from state $j$ to state $i$ contributes a positive term $\\lambda_{ji}P_j(t)$ to $P_i'(t)$. The flow from state 0 to state 1 should add to the probability of being in state 1. Therefore, the term should be $\\lambda_{01}P_{0}(t)$, not $-\\lambda_{01}P_{0}(t)$. We will proceed with this standard and necessary correction.\n\nWith $P_i'(t) = 0$, the system of differential equations becomes a system of linear algebraic equations:\n1. $0 = -\\lambda_{01}p_{0} + \\lambda_{10}p_{1}$\n2. $0 = \\lambda_{01}p_{0} - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12})p_{1} + \\lambda_{21}p_{2} + \\lambda_{31}p_{3}$\n3. $0 = \\lambda_{12}p_{1} - (\\lambda_{21} + \\lambda_{23})p_{2}$\n4. $0 = \\lambda_{23}p_{2} - \\lambda_{31}p_{3}$\nAnd we also have the normalization condition:\n5. $p_{0} + p_{1} + p_{2} + p_{3} = 1$\n\nMy plan is to solve this system of linear equations to find the values of $p_0, p_1, p_2$, and $p_3$. I will express $p_0, p_2, p_3$ in terms of $p_1$ using equations 1, 3, and 4. Then, I will substitute these expressions into the normalization equation (5) to solve for $p_1$. Once $p_1$ is known, I can find $p_0$ and compute the required sum $p_0 + p_1$.\n\nThe following Python script automates this calculation.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the given lambda values\nlambda_01 = 0.019\nlambda_10 = 0.65\nlambda_12 = 0.4\nlambda_21 = 0.392\nlambda_23 = 0.008\nlambda_31 = 0.008\n\nprint(\"Solving for the steady-state probabilities p0, p1, p2, p3.\")\nprint(\"The system of equations is:\")\nprint(f\"1) 0 = -{lambda_01}*p0 + {lambda_10}*p1\")\nprint(f\"2) 0 = {lambda_12}*p1 - ({lambda_21} + {lambda_23})*p2\")\nprint(f\"3) 0 = {lambda_23}*p2 - {lambda_31}*p3\")\nprint(\"4) 1 = p0 + p1 + p2 + p3\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\n\n# Step 1: Express p0, p2, p3 in terms of p1\n# From equation 1: p0 = (lambda_10 / lambda_01) * p1\nk0 = lambda_10 / lambda_01\nprint(f\"From eq 1, p0 = ({lambda_10} / {lambda_01}) * p1 = {k0:.4f} * p1\")\n\n# From equation 2: p2 = (lambda_12 / (lambda_21 + lambda_23)) * p1\nk2_num = lambda_12\nk2_den = lambda_21 + lambda_23\nk2 = k2_num / k2_den\nprint(f\"From eq 2, p2 = ({lambda_12} / ({lambda_21} + {lambda_23})) * p1 = {k2:.4f} * p1\")\n\n# From equation 3: p3 = (lambda_23 / lambda_31) * p2\nk3 = lambda_23 / lambda_31\n# Since p2 = k2 * p1, then p3 = k3 * k2 * p1\nprint(f\"From eq 3, p3 = ({lambda_23} / {lambda_31}) * p2 = {k3:.4f} * p2 = {k3*k2:.4f} * p1\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\n\n# Step 2: Substitute into the normalization equation to find p1\n# p0 + p1 + p2 + p3 = 1\n# (k0 * p1) + p1 + (k2 * p1) + (k3 * k2 * p1) = 1\n# p1 * (k0 + 1 + k2 + k3 * k2) = 1\np1_coeff = k0 + 1 + k2 + (k3 * k2)\np1 = 1 / p1_coeff\n\n# Step 3: Calculate p0\np0 = k0 * p1\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the required sum p0 + p1\nresult = p0 + p1\n\nprint(\"Solving for p1 using the normalization equation p0 + p1 + p2 + p3 = 1:\")\nprint(f\"p1 * ({k0:.4f} + 1 + {k2:.4f} + {k3*k2:.4f}) = 1\")\nprint(f\"p1 * {p1_coeff:.4f} = 1\")\nprint(f\"p1 = {p1:.10f}\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\n\nprint(f\"Now we calculate p0:\")\nprint(f\"p0 = {k0:.4f} * p1 = {k0:.4f} * {p1:.10f} = {p0:.10f}\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\n\nprint(\"Finally, we calculate the required sum P0(inf) + P1(inf), which is p0 + p1.\")\nprint(\"The final equation is:\")\nprint(f\"p0 + p1 = {p0:.10f} + {p1:.10f}\")\nprint(f\"p0 + p1 = {result}\")\n\n```\n<<<0.9462517680339463>>>"
