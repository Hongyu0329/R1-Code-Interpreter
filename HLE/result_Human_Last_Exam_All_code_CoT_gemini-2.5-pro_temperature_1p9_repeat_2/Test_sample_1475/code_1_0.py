    Step-by-step derivation of the solution:

    1.  The space X is a compact connected metric space with more than one point.
        This implies X is a perfect Polish space (a complete, separable metric space
        with no isolated points). Examples include the interval [0, 1].

    2.  The space 2^X of non-empty closed subsets of X with the Hausdorff metric
        is a compact metric space, hence also a Polish space.

    3.  The space P(X) consists of sets that are closures of non-trivial convergent
        sequences. A set A is in P(X) if and only if its derived set A' (the set
        of its limit points) is a singleton, i.e., card(A') = 1.

    4.  It is a result from descriptive set theory that the set
        {A in 2^X | card(A') <= 1} is a G_delta subset of 2^X (a countable
        intersection of open sets). P(X) is this set minus the finite sets (for
        which A' is empty). The set of finite sets is an F_sigma set, so its
        complement is G_delta. Thus, P(X) is a G_delta subset of 2^X.

    5.  Since P(X) is a G_delta subset of a Polish space (2^X), P(X) is itself
        a Polish space (i.e., it is completely metrizable).

    6.  The space P(X) is non-empty (as X has non-trivial convergent sequences) and
        has no isolated points. Thus, P(X) is a perfect Polish space.

    7.  The Baire Category Theorem states that an intersection of countably many open
        dense subsets of a complete metric space is a dense G_delta subset.
        Let G be such an intersection in P(X).

    8.  Therefore, G is a dense G_delta subset of P(X). As a dense subset of a
        perfect space, G is also perfect. As a G_delta subset of a Polish space,
        G is also Polish. So, G is a non-empty perfect Polish space.

    9.  A fundamental theorem of topology (the Cantor-Bendixson theorem, generalized
        by Alexandrov and Hausdorff) states that any non-empty perfect Polish
        space has the cardinality of the continuum (c, or 2^aleph_0).

    10. Therefore, the cardinality of the intersection G is always the cardinality
        of the continuum. This is the only possible value, so it is also the
        smallest possible cardinality.
