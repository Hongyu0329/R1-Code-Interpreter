    "To find the separatrix of the given system of differential equations, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Find Equilibrium Points:** I'll start by finding the points `(d, u)` where both `d'(t)` and `u'(t)` are equal to zero. These are the points where the system is stationary.\n2.  **Analyze Stability:** For each equilibrium point, I will compute the Jacobian matrix of the system. The eigenvalues of the Jacobian evaluated at an equilibrium point determine its stability. A point with both positive and negative real eigenvalues is a saddle point.\n3.  **Identify the Separatrix:** Separatrices are special trajectories that often originate from saddle points and separate the phase plane into regions of different dynamic behavior. These are typically the stable or unstable manifolds of the saddle point. I will look for an invariant manifold of the system, which is a curve `d = f(u)` that is composed of system trajectories. I will test a polynomial form for `f(u)` and see if it satisfies the differential equations.\n4.  **Formulate the Equation:** Once the specific form of the invariant manifold that acts as a separatrix is found, I will state its equation.\n\nThe Python code below automates these steps using the `sympy` library for symbolic mathematics.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef find_separatrix():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the separatrix for the given system of differential equations.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define symbols\n    d, u = sympy.symbols('d u')\n\n    # Define the system of ODEs\n    # d'(t) = 2*d**2 + (-3*u + 5*u**2)*d - u**3*(1-u)\n    # u'(t) = (u-1)*u**2\n    d_prime = 2*d**2 + (-3*u + 5*u**2)*d - u**2*u*(1-u)\n    u_prime = (u-1)*u**2\n\n    print(\"--- Step 1: Finding Equilibrium Points ---\")\n    u_sols = sympy.solve(u_prime, u)\n    equilibria = []\n    for u_sol in u_sols:\n        # We are only interested in the u >= 0 half-plane\n        if u_sol.is_real and u_sol >= 0:\n            d_eq = d_prime.subs(u, u_sol)\n            d_sols = sympy.solve(d_eq, d)\n            for d_sol in d_sols:\n                equilibria.append((d_sol, u_sol))\n\n    print(f\"The equilibrium points (d, u) in the u>=0 plane are: {equilibria}\")\n    \n    print(\"\\n--- Step 2: Stability Analysis via Jacobian ---\")\n    system_matrix = sympy.Matrix([d_prime, u_prime])\n    vars_matrix = sympy.Matrix([d, u])\n    J = system_matrix.jacobian(vars_matrix)\n\n    saddle_points = []\n    for point in equilibria:\n        J_at_point = J.subs([(d, point[0]), (u, point[1])])\n        eigenvals = list(J_at_point.eigenvals().keys())\n        \n        # Check if eigenvalues have opposite signs (saddle point condition)\n        is_saddle = len(eigenvals) == 2 and eigenvals[0] * eigenvals[1] < 0\n        point_type = \"a saddle point\" if is_saddle else \"not a saddle point\"\n        \n        print(f\"Point {point} is {point_type} with eigenvalues {eigenvals}.\")\n        if is_saddle:\n            saddle_points.append(point)\n\n    print(f\"\\nThe saddle point is: {saddle_points[0]}\")\n    \n    print(\"\\n--- Step 3: Finding the Invariant Manifold ---\")\n    print(\"A separatrix is an invariant manifold, often related to a saddle point.\")\n    print(\"Let's test for a solution of the form d = c * u**2.\")\n\n    c = sympy.Symbol('c')\n    # Proposed solution d = c * u^2\n    # Its time derivative is d'(t) = d(c*u^2)/du * u'(t) = 2*c*u * u'(t)\n    d_test = c*u**2\n    d_prime_test = sympy.diff(d_test, u) * u_prime\n    \n    # Substitute d = c*u^2 into the original equation for d'(t)\n    d_prime_orig = d_prime.subs(d, d_test)\n    \n    # The equation must hold for all u, so the difference must be zero.\n    equation_for_c = sympy.simplify(d_prime_orig - d_prime_test)\n    \n    # Since this polynomial in u must be zero for all u, all its coefficients must be zero.\n    # Sympy can solve for c directly.\n    sol = sympy.solve(equation_for_c, c)\n    c_val = sol[0]\n    \n    print(f\"Substituting d = c*u^2 into the system yields the equation: {equation_for_c} = 0\")\n    print(f\"Solving for the constant c gives c = {c_val}.\")\n    \n    # Construct the final separatrix equation: d - c*u^2 = 0\n    separatrix_eq = d - c_val*u**2\n    \n    print(\"\\n--- Step 4: The Separatrix Equation ---\")\n    print(f\"The separatrix is given by the equation: {separatrix_eq} = 0\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nThe equation for the separatrix with explicit coefficients is:\")\n    d_coeff = separatrix_eq.coeff(d)\n    u2_coeff = separatrix_eq.coeff(u**2)\n    # The term u**2 has exponent 2.\n    print(f\"{d_coeff}*d(t) + {u2_coeff}*u(t)^2 = 0\")\n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    find_separatrix()\n```\n<<<d + u**2 = 0>>>"
