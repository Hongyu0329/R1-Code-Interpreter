    "Of course. Here is my plan to find the radical of the character \"謄\":\n\n1.  **Analyze the character:** First, I will break down the kanji \"謄\" into its constituent parts.\n2.  **Identify the radical:** The character \"謄\" is composed of two main parts: a left component \"月\" and a right component \"朕\". The radical (bushu) is the classifying element, which is typically on the left or top. In this case, the radical is \"月\".\n3.  **Determine the radical's name:** While \"月\" is the character for \"moon\" (tsuki), when used as a radical on the left side of characters related to the body or flesh (like in 謄, which relates to copying documents, historically involving animal skins), it is a variant of the \"meat\" radical, \"肉\" (niku). This specific form is called \"にくづき\" (nikuzuki).\n4.  **Transcribe to Hepburn:** I will convert the hiragana \"にくづき\" into its standard Hepburn romanization, which is \"Nikuzuki\".\n5.  **Create the script:** Finally, I will write a simple Python script to print this answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_radical_name():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the radical for the character 謄 and returns its name.\n    \n    Character: 謄\n    Radical: 月 (in this context, a variant of 肉 'niku', meaning flesh/meat)\n    Japanese Name: にくづき (Nikuzuki)\n    Hepburn Transcription: Nikuzuki\n    \"\"\"\n    radical_name = \"Nikuzuki\"\n    print(radical_name)\n\nfind_radical_name()\n```\n<<<Nikuzuki>>>"
