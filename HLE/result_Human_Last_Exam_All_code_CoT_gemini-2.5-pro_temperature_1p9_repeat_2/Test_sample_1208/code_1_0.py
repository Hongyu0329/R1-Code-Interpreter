    # II: A valid and strong option (methadone).
    # III: A poor option (rapid taper), generally unsafe.
    # IV: Best practice and essential for complex cases (multidisciplinary team).
    # V: An excellent, modern, and safe option (buprenorphine-naloxone) that addresses the patient's specific question.
