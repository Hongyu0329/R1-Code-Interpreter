# Step 1: Define the known values for the system.
# The pKa of Bromophenol blue is the pH where acidic and basic forms are in equal concentration.
pKa = 4.1
# The pH of the solution is given.
pH = 4.21
# The dimensions of the prism define the path lengths. We convert them to cm.
path_thin = 1 / 10.0  # 1mm = 0.1cm
path_thick = 10.0  # 10cm

# Step 2: Use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the ratio of the indicator's forms.
# pH = pKa + log10([In-]/[HIn]), where [In-] is the basic (blue) form and [HIn] is the acidic (yellow) form.
log_ratio = pH - pKa
# Calculate the ratio: [Blue Form] / [Yellow Form]
ratio = 10**log_ratio

# Step 3: Print the step-by-step reasoning.

print("The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation helps us find the proportion of the different colored forms of the indicator.")
print(f"The equation is: pH = pKa + log10([Blue Form]/[Yellow Form])")
print(f"Rearranging for the ratio: log10([Blue]/[Yellow]) = pH - pKa = {pH} - {pKa} = {log_ratio:.2f}")
print(f"This means the ratio of [Blue Form] to [Yellow Form] is 10^{log_ratio:.2f}, which is approximately {ratio:.2f} to 1.")
print("Since both the yellow and blue forms are present in significant amounts, their colors mix. A mix of yellow and blue light is perceived by the human eye as green.")
print("Therefore, the fundamental color of the solution is green.")

print("\nPart 2: Determining the Color Intensity (Effect of Path Length)")
print("The Beer-Lambert Law states that absorbance is proportional to the path length of light through the solution.")
print(f"Path length through the thin side = {path_thin} cm.")
print(f"Path length through the thick side = {path_thick} cm.")
print("A short path length (the thin side) results in low light absorbance, making the color appear light or pale.")
print("A long path length (the thick side) results in high light absorbance, making the color appear dark and intense.")

print("\n--- Conclusion ---")
print("Based on this analysis:")
print(f"The color viewed through the thin side ({path_thin} cm) will be light green.")
print(f"The color viewed through the thick side ({path_thick} cm) will be a darker, more saturated green.")
print("This matches the answer choice: Thin: light green, Thick: green.")
