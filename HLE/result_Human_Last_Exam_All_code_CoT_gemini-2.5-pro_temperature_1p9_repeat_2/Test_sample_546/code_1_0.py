# The value of p given in the problem
p = 18446744074401676349

# As per the analysis, the complex function f(p) is hypothesized to simplify
# to the expression p^2 + 4.
# This code calculates the value of this simplified expression.

# Calculate p squared
p_squared = p * p

# Calculate the final result
result = p_squared + 4

# Print the final equation with all the numbers involved, as requested.
# The equation shows the steps of calculating p^2 + 4.
