    "Here is my plan to solve the task.\n1.  First, I will identify the main, stable allotropes of phosphorus.\n2.  Next, I will determine the characteristic color of each of these allotropes.\n3.  I will then count the number of distinct colors identified.\n4.  Finally, I will write a Python script that defines a list of these colors, prints an equation showing the count of each color summing to the total, and states the final number.\n\n```python\n# The main allotropes of phosphorus exhibit distinct colors.\n# We will list these colors and then count them.\n\n# List of colors for the main phosphorus allotropes.\ncolors = [\"white\", \"red\", \"violet\", \"black\"]\n\n# Get the total number of colors.\nnum_colors = len(colors)\n\nprint(f\"The colors of pure phosphorus allotropes are {', '.join(colors)}.\")\nprint(\"This gives us a total count based on the following equation:\")\n\n# Create and print the equation as requested.\n# \"1\" represents the count for each distinct color.\nequation_parts = [\"1\"] * num_colors\nequation_str = \" + \".join(equation_parts)\nprint(f\"{equation_str} = {num_colors}\")\n\nprint(f\"\\nTherefore, there are {num_colors} distinct colors that can be observed in pure allotropes of phosphorus.\")\n```\n<<<4>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first.
