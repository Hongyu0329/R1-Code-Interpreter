    "Based on the primary scientific literature describing the skull of *Irritator challengeri*, specifically the 2002 paper by Sues et al., the lacrimal recess is a complex feature that is itself subdivided into smaller depressions, or fossae. My plan is to represent the number of these subdivisions as described in the paper and sum them to find the total.\n\n1.  **Identify Main Depression:** The literature describes a large, primary fossa (depression) located in the posterior part of the lacrimal recess.\n2.  **Identify Subsidiary Depressions:** Anterior to this main fossa, there are two smaller, subsidiary fossae.\n3.  **Calculate Total:** I will add the number of main fossae and subsidiary fossae to get the total count of depressions within the lacrimal recess.\n4.  **Present as an Equation:** I will print the breakdown and the final sum as an equation.\n\n```python\n# Based on the paleontological description of the Irritator challengeri skull (holotype SMNS 58022),\n# the lacrimal recess contains several distinct depressions (fossae).\n\n# The number of large, posterior fossae (depressions) within the lacrimal recess.\nnum_posterior_fossae = 1\n\n# The number of smaller, anterior fossae (depressions) within the lacrimal recess.\nnum_anterior_fossae = 2\n\n# Calculate the total number of depressions by adding them together.\ntotal_depressions = num_posterior_fossae + num_anterior_fossae\n\n# Print the final result in an equation format.\nprint(f\"The lacrimal recess in Irritator challengeri contains {num_posterior_fossae} main posterior fossa and {num_anterior_fossae} smaller anterior fossae.\")\nprint(f\"The total number of depressions is: {num_posterior_fossae} + {num_anterior_fossae} = {total_depressions}\")\n```\n<<<3>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    How many depressions does the lacrimal recess in Irritator challengeri contain?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
