# The calculation to estimate the mass is based on the formula:
# Mass = (4/3) * pi * r^3 * density
# We use the following values and approximations that the parrot can handle:
# Formula for volume of a sphere: 4/3
# Approximation for pi: 3
# Radius r = 0.5 cm, which is 1/2 cm. The cube is (1/2)*(1/2)*(1/2).
# Density = 0.9 kg/cm3, which is 9/10 kg/cm3.

# The final calculation using fractions with integers no larger than 10 is:
print("mass = (4 / 3) * 3 * (1 / 2) * (1 / 2) * (1 / 2) * (9 / 10)")
