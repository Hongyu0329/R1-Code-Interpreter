    print("Sentence A: 'She_i likes Mary_i and Jane.'")
    print("Violation: Principle C.")
    print("Explanation: The R-expression 'Mary_i' must be free (i.e., not c-commanded by a co-referential element).")
    print("In this sentence, the pronoun 'She_i' c-commands and refers to the same person as 'Mary_i'. This is a direct violation of Principle C.")

    # Analysis of Sentence B
    print("Sentence B: 'Whose does John like glasses?'")
    print("Violation: Empty Category Principle (ECP) / Left Branch Condition.")
    print("Explanation: This sentence is ungrammatical due to an invalid movement. The word 'Whose' has been extracted from the noun phrase 'Whose glasses'.")
    print("The trace (empty category) left by this movement is not properly licensed, violating the ECP, a core principle governing empty categories within the broader binding framework.")

    # Analysis of Sentence C
    print("Sentence C: 'Who does John like Mary and?'")
    print("Violation: Empty Category Principle (ECP) / Coordinate Structure Constraint.")
    print("Explanation: This sentence is ungrammatical because the wh-word 'Who' has been extracted from a coordinate structure ('Mary and Who').")
    print("Extraction from coordinate structures is prohibited. The resulting trace is not licensed, violating the ECP.")

    # Final Conclusion
    print("Conclusion: All three sentences (A, B, and C) are ungrammatical because they violate principles of binding theory.")
    print("A violates Principle C, while B and C violate the Empty Category Principle (ECP), which governs the licensing of traces.")
