# The user is asking about a property of a neural network that determines its
# optimal parameters under a specific theoretical interpretation.
# This interpretation, based on perturbation theory, often relates to the
# behavior of very large networks (infinite-width and/or infinite-depth limits).
# In this context, theories like the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) and its extensions
# show that the network's behavior is fundamentally governed by the relative
# scaling of its architectural dimensions.

# Let's define the primary architectural dimensions of a deep feedforward network.
# L = depth of the network (number of layers)
# N = width of the network (number of neurons per layer)

depth_L = 12
width_N = 1024

# In these advanced theories, the ratio of depth to width is not just an
# implementation detail but a critical hyperparameter that determines the
# 'phase' in which the network operates (e.g., lazy training vs. rich feature learning).
# This, in turn, dictates the nature of the optimal parameters the network can achieve.

# We can express this determining factor as a ratio.
critical_ratio = depth_L / width_N

# To illustrate how this property 'determines' the optimal parameters (Theta*),
# we can use a symbolic equation. This is not a real-world computation but an
# illustration of the theoretical principle.
# Symbolic Form: Theta* = Function(Data, Initial_Params, Critical_Architectural_Property)
