    1.  The question asks to identify the main source of damage repaired by a specific method: "manual TIG welding (GTAW) build-up of layers of filler material". This method is additive, meaning it is used to restore material that has been lost.

    2.  Let's analyze the answer choices based on this repair method:
        *   A, E (Cracking): These are fractures. While they can be weld-repaired, the primary process isn't described as "building up layers."
        *   D (Creep Deformation): This is the stretching of the entire blade due to heat and stress. A localized TIG build-up cannot fix this; it usually requires blade replacement.
        *   B, F (FOD, Corrosion): These cause material loss in nicks, gouges, or surface degradation. TIG welding is a valid repair method.
        *   C (Blade Tip Rub and Wear): This is a very common issue where thermal expansion causes the blade tips to rub against the engine casing, wearing them down. The standard, routine repair is to use TIG welding to add layers of material back onto the tip, which is then re-profiled.

    3.  Conclusion: The process of "build-up of layers" is a perfect description for repairing the material lost from blade tips due to rubbing and wear. It is one of the most common applications for this type of manual welding repair in engine MRO.
