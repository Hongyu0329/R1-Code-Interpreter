# The problem is to find the number of internal adjunctions from [23] to [37].
# This corresponds to counting order-preserving maps L: [23] -> [37]
# with the property L(0) = 0.
m = 23
n = 37

# This is a combination with repetition problem. We need to choose m values
# (L(1), ..., L(m)) from a set of n+1 possible values (0, ..., n) in a
# non-decreasing order.
# The formula is C(k+N-1, k) where k is the number of items to choose
# and N is the number of categories.
# Here k=m=23, N=n+1=38.
# So the number of combinations is C(23 + 38 - 1, 23) = C(60, 23).
k = m
N = n + 1
numerator_val = N + k - 1
denominator_val = k

# Calculate the binomial coefficient C(60, 23)
result = math.comb(numerator_val, denominator_val)

# The numbers in the final equation are 60 and 23.
