    "This problem asks for the maximum possible chromatic number, $\\chi(G)$, for a graph $G$ with $n=12345$ vertices, given that $G$ is not the complete graph, $K_n$.\n\nHere is my plan to solve this problem:\n1.  **Understand the Chromatic Number:** The chromatic number of a graph, $\\chi(G)$, is the minimum number of colors needed for a proper vertex coloring, where no two adjacent vertices share the same color.\n2.  **Recall the upper bound for Chromatic Number:** For any graph $G$ with $n$ vertices, the chromatic number is always less than or equal to the number of vertices, i.e., $\\chi(G) \\le n$.\n3.  **Identify the specific case of equality:** The equality $\\chi(G) = n$ holds if and only if the graph $G$ is the complete graph $K_n$, where every vertex is connected to every other vertex.\n4.  **Apply the problem's constraint:** The problem specifies that the graph $G$ is *not* the complete graph. Therefore, its chromatic number must be strictly less than $n$. This gives us the inequality $\\chi(G) < n$, which means $\\chi(G) \\le n-1$.\n5.  **Prove the maximum is achievable:** To show that $n-1$ is the maximum possible value, we need to demonstrate that there exists at least one graph with $n$ vertices which is not complete and has a chromatic number of exactly $n-1$.\n    *   Consider a graph constructed by taking a complete graph on $n-1$ vertices, $K_{n-1}$, and adding one more vertex as an isolated vertex.\n    *   This graph has a total of $n$ vertices. It is not a complete graph because the isolated vertex is not connected to the others.\n    *   The $K_{n-1}$ subgraph requires $n-1$ distinct colors. The isolated vertex can be colored with any of these $n-1$ colors without conflict. Thus, the chromatic number of this graph is exactly $n-1$.\n6.  **Calculate the final answer:** Based on the above reasoning, the maximum number of colors required is $n-1$. With $n=12345$, the value is $12345 - 1 = 12344$. I will write a simple Python script to perform this calculation and print the result.\n\n```python\ndef solve_graph_coloring_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the maximum number of colors needed to properly\n    color a graph G with n vertices, given that G is not a complete graph.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The number of vertices in the graph G.\n    num_vertices = 12345\n    \n    # According to graph theory, a graph with n vertices has a chromatic number of n\n    # if and only if it is the complete graph K_n.\n    # Since the graph G is not a complete graph, its chromatic number must be less than n.\n    # So, the maximum possible chromatic number is n - 1.\n    # This maximum is achieved, for example, by a graph composed of a complete\n    # subgraph K_{n-1} and one isolated vertex.\n    \n    max_colors = num_vertices - 1\n    \n    # Print the equation as requested.\n    print(f\"{num_vertices} - 1 = {max_colors}\")\n\nsolve_graph_coloring_problem()\n```\n<<<12344>>>"
