    "The Modern English word \"sister\" is a loanword from Old Norse \"systir,\" which replaced the native Old English word due to the extensive contact and linguistic exchange between the Anglo-Saxons and Viking invaders.\n\nTo figure out what the word would be without this influence, we must look at the original Old English word and trace its likely evolution based on known sound changes that occurred in English over the centuries.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  Identify the original Old English word for \"sister,\" which is \"sweostor.\"\n2.  Analyze how similar Old English words evolved into Modern English. For example, the final \"-or\" in kinship terms like `brōþor` and `mōdor` shifted to \"-er\" to become \"brother\" and \"mother.\"\n3.  Apply this phonological rule to \"sweostor.\"\n4.  Examine the evolution of the \"eo\" vowel sound, which often simplified.\n5.  Construct the most probable Modern English word based on these linguistic changes.\n6.  The Python script below will demonstrate this transformation step-by-step.\n\n```python\ndef find_hypothetical_word():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function demonstrates the likely linguistic evolution of the Old English\n    word for \"sister\" into a hypothetical Modern English equivalent, had it not\n    been replaced by a word from Old Norse.\n    \"\"\"\n    old_english_word = \"sweostor\"\n    \n    print(f\"The native Old English word for 'sister' was: {old_english_word}\")\n    \n    # Step 1: The 'eo' diphthong often simplified to 'e'.\n    # This is a common sound change from Old to Middle English.\n    middle_english_step1 = old_english_word.replace(\"eo\", \"e\")\n    print(f\"Step 1: The vowel 'eo' would likely simplify to 'e', resulting in: {middle_english_step1}\")\n\n    # Step 2: The unstressed ending '-or' in kinship terms like 'broþor' and 'modor'\n    # became '-er' in Modern English ('brother', 'mother').\n    hypothetical_modern_english_word = middle_english_step1[:-2] + \"er\"\n    print(f\"Step 2: The ending '-or' would likely shift to '-er', resulting in: {hypothetical_modern_english_word}\")\n    \n    print(\"\\n---\")\n    print(f\"Therefore, without the Norse influence that gave us 'sister', the Modern English word would likely have been '{hypothetical_modern_english_word}'.\")\n    print(f\"This is supported by the survival of 'suster' in some dialects and the Scots language.\")\n\nfind_hypothetical_word()\n```\n<<<swester>>>"
