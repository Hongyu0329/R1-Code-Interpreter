    print("Thinking Steps:")
    
    print("1. Analyze the Vaganova cambré derrière:")
    print("   - The Vaganova method emphasizes stability and control.")
    print("   - In a cambré derrière, the bend initiates from the upper back (thoracic spine), with the chest lifting upwards.")
    print("   - A key rule is that the hips must remain square and stable, staying vertically aligned over the supporting legs. There is no forward displacement of the pelvis.")

    print("\n2. Analyze the Balanchine cambré derrière:")
    print("   - The Balanchine style often exaggerates classical lines for aesthetic and dynamic effect.")
    print("   - In a cambré derrière, the dancer is typically encouraged to push the hips and pelvis forward as the upper body bends back.")
    print("   - This forward hip placement creates a deeper, more extreme backbend, forming a 'C' curve with the entire body.")

    print("\n3. Compare the two methods and evaluate the options:")
    print("   - A (Arm placement) and E (Placement of head): While subtle stylistic differences may exist, they are not the primary, defining technical distinction.")
    print("   - C (Speed): While Balanchine's general style is faster, the speed of an individual cambré is not its fundamental technical difference.")
    print("   - D (Degree of backbend): A greater degree of backbend in the Balanchine style is a *result* of the technique used, not the technique itself. The question asks for the difference in the method, not the outcome.")
    print("   - B (Placement of hip): This is the core mechanical difference. Vaganova requires stable hips, while Balanchine uses a forward hip placement. This fundamental difference in hip action dictates the entire look and feel of the movement in each style.")

    print("\nConclusion:")
    print("The most significant and fundamental difference between the two methods for a cambré derrière is the placement of the hip.")
    print(f"Therefore, the correct choice is: B. {options['B']}")
