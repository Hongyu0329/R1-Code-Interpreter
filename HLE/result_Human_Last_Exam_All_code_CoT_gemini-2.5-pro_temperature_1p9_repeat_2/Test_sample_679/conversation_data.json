    "My plan is to deduce the structure of the hydrocarbon step-by-step and then determine its IUPAC name.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Formula**: The formula C7H14 corresponds to a degree of unsaturation of 1, indicating one double bond or one ring in the structure.\n2.  **Analyze the ¹³C NMR Data**:\n    *   The presence of signals at 145 ppm and 112 ppm strongly suggests a C=C double bond, confirming the degree of unsaturation is due to an alkene.\n    *   The multiplicities (s, t, d, q) tell us about the number of hydrogens attached to each carbon: s=C (quaternary), t=CH₂ (methylene), d=CH (methine), q=CH₃ (methyl).\n    *   The compound has 7 carbons, but there are only 6 NMR signals. This means two of the carbons are chemically equivalent and share the same signal.\n3.  **Deduce Structural Fragments**: I will interpret each signal to build structural fragments. The 145(s) and 112(t) signals correspond to a `>C=CH₂` group. The other signals represent the aliphatic part of the molecule. The fact that there are two quartet signals and a doublet, with one signal overlapping, points towards an isopropyl group `(-CH(CH₃)₂)` and another methyl group.\n4.  **Assemble the Final Structure**: I will connect the deduced fragments to form a complete molecule that is consistent with the molecular formula and all the NMR data.\n5.  **Determine the IUPAC Name**: Based on the final structure, I will follow IUPAC nomenclature rules to assign the official name.\n6.  **Generate Python Code**: The Python code will print this entire reasoning process, showing the assignment of each NMR signal to a carbon in the final structure, and conclude with the IUPAC name.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_structure():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the provided molecular formula and 13C NMR data to determine the IUPAC name of the compound.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # --- Input Data ---\n    molecular_formula = \"C7H14\"\n    nmr_signals = {\n        145: 's', 112: 't', 48: 't', 27: 'd', 22: 'q', 21: 'q'\n    }\n\n    print(\"Step-by-step analysis to determine the IUPAC name:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    # --- Step 1: Analyze Molecular Formula ---\n    print(\"\\n1.
