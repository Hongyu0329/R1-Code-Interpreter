    "To determine the latest historical battle depicted in a painting by Lady Butler, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify Famous Battle Paintings:** I will create a list of well-known battle paintings by Elizabeth Thompson, Lady Butler.\n2.  **Map Paintings to Battle Dates:** For each painting, I will identify the specific battle it portrays and find the year in which that battle occurred.\n3.  **Determine the Latest Battle:** I will compare all the battle dates to find the one that occurred most recently in history.\n4.  **Generate Python Code:** I will write a Python script that stores this information in a dictionary, finds the maximum year, and prints the details of the corresponding painting and battle.\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef find_latest_battle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the latest historical battle depicted in a painting by Lady Butler.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Data of Lady Butler's paintings and the year of the battle depicted.\n    # Painting Title: Year of Battle\n    paintings = {\n        \"'Steady the Drums and Fifes' (Battle of Albuera)\": 1811,\n        \"'Scotland for Ever!'
