    "Here is the step-by-step thinking process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Request:** The user wants to know the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Terraria's Expert Mode, assuming an infinite number of players. The answer must be provided as a Python script that explains the calculation.\n\n2.  **Identify Base Stats:** First, I need the boss's base health in Expert Mode. According to the official Terraria Wiki, the Eye of Cthulhu has **3640** base HP in Expert Mode.\n\n3.  **Identify Health Scaling Formula:** Next, I need the multiplayer health scaling formula. For Expert Mode, boss health is increased by 35% of its base health for every player in the game after the first one.\n    *   Health increase per additional player = `Base Health * 0.35`\n    *   Health increase per additional player = `3640 * 0.35` = `1274`\n    *   The full formula is: `Total Health = 3640 + 1274 * (Number Of Players - 1)`\n\n4.  **Evaluate the \"Infinite Players\" Condition:** The user specifies an \"infinite number of players\". If we apply this to the formula, as the number of players approaches infinity, the Total Health also approaches infinity. This suggests there isn't a mathematical limit based on the gameplay formula alone.\n\n5.  **Consider Technical Limitations:** A \"theoretical maximum\" in a computer program is often limited by the data type used to store the value. Terraria is built on the C# programming language, which uses a 32-bit signed integer (`Int32`) to store NPC health. The maximum value a 32-bit signed integer can hold is `2^31 - 1`. This value acts as a hard cap for any NPC's health in the game, overriding any scaling formula that would result in a higher number.\n\n6.  **Formulate the Final Answer:** The true theoretical maximum health for any NPC in Terraria, including the Eye of Cthulhu, is the maximum value of a 32-bit signed integer. The Python code will not use the player scaling formula, as it's superseded by the engine's hard cap. Instead, the code will calculate and display this hard cap value, explaining why it is the correct answer. The equation shown will be the calculation for this integer limit.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_max_health():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the theoretical maximum health for an NPC in Terraria.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the base health and scaling factor for context.\n    base_health = 3640\n    scaling_per_player = 0.35\n    health_increase = base_health * scaling_per_player\n\n    print(f\"The health scaling formula for the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode is:\")\n    print(f\"Total Health = {base_health} (Base) + {int(health_increase)} * (Number of Players - 1)\\n\")\n    \n    print(\"With an infinite number of players, this formula would approach infinity.\")\n    print(\"However, Terraria's engine has a hard limit on NPC health based on its data type.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Define the components of the actual technical limit.\n    # Health is stored as a 32-bit signed integer, which has a maximum value of 2^31 - 1.\n    base = 2\n    exponent = 31\n    subtract = 1\n    \n    # Step 3: Calculate the maximum value.\n    max_health = int(math.pow(base, exponent)) - subtract\n\n    # Step 4: Print the final equation and the result.\n    print(\"The theoretical maximum health is capped by the maximum value of a 32-bit signed integer.\")\n    print(\"The equation for this limit is:\")\n    print(f\"{base} ** {exponent} - {subtract} = {max_health}\")\n    print(\"\\nTherefore, the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu is this value.\")\n\ncalculate_max_health()\n```\n<<<2147483647>>>"
