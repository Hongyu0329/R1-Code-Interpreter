The formula for the fermionic partition function Z in the imaginary time representation using the path integral formalism is:

Z = ∫ D[ψ*] D[ψ] * exp(-S_E[ψ*, ψ])

Where the terms in the equation are:

  Z: The Grand Canonical Partition Function. It is the fundamental quantity in quantum statistical mechanics from which thermodynamic properties can be derived.

  ∫ D[ψ*] D[ψ]: This represents the functional or path integral. It means we are summing over all possible configurations of the fermionic fields ψ* and ψ throughout spacetime.

  ψ*(τ, x) and ψ(τ, x): These are the fermionic fields, which are functions of imaginary time (τ) and position (x). Crucially, for fermions, these are not ordinary numbers but anti-commuting Grassmann numbers.

  exp(-S_E): The exponential factor is the statistical weight for each field configuration, analogous to the Boltzmann factor in classical statistical mechanics.

  S_E[ψ*, ψ]: This is the Euclidean action of the system. It is defined as:

    S_E = ∫[from 0 to β] dτ ∫ d³x  ψ*(τ, x) * [∂/∂τ + H₀] * ψ(τ, x)

    - S_E: Euclidean Action.
    - ∫[from 0 to β] dτ: Integral over imaginary time from 0 to β.
      - β = 1 / (k_B * T), where k_B is the Boltzmann constant and T is the temperature.
    - ∫ d³x: Integral over all of spatial volume.
    - ∂/∂τ: The partial derivative with respect to imaginary time.
    - H₀: The single-particle Hamiltonian operator. A common example is H₀ = -ħ²∇²/2m - μ, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant, m is the particle mass, ∇² is the Laplacian operator, and μ is the chemical potential.

A key feature for fermions is that the Grassmann fields must obey anti-periodic boundary conditions in the imaginary time direction:

  ψ(τ, x) = -ψ(τ + β, x)
