    "Of course. Here is my plan to solve this problem, followed by the Python code.\n\nThe number of independent components of the Riemann tensor depends on the symmetries of the tensor, which are determined by the geometric structure of the manifold.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **General Case (for context):** On a generic $n$-dimensional Riemannian manifold, the Riemann tensor $R_{ijkl}$ has a number of symmetries that reduce its independent components to $N(n) = \\frac{n^2(n^2 - 1)}{12}$.\n2.  **Kähler Manifold Case:** A Kähler manifold is a special type of Riemannian manifold that also has a complex structure. Its real dimension $n$ is always even, so we write $n = 2m$, where $m$ is the complex dimension. The compatibility between the Riemannian metric and the complex structure (the Kähler condition) imposes powerful additional symmetries on the Riemann tensor.\n3.  **The Formula:** These additional symmetries significantly reduce the number of independent components. For a Kähler manifold of complex dimension $m$, the number of independent real components of the Riemann tensor is given by the much simpler formula:\n    $$N_{\\text{Kähler}} = \\left( \\frac{m(m+1)}{2} \\right)^2$$\n4.  **Code Implementation:** Since the question is general, I will provide a Python script that calculates this value for a canonical and important example: a manifold of complex dimension **m=2**. A well-known example of such a manifold is a K3 surface. The code will explicitly show the value of each term in the formula as it computes the final answer.\n\nHere is the Python code for the calculation.\n\n```python\n# Set the complex dimension 'm'. We use m=2 as a canonical example for a Kähler manifold (e.g., a K3 surface).\nm = 2\n\nprint(f\"We will calculate the number of independent Riemann tensor components for a Kähler manifold of complex dimension m = {m}.\")\nprint(\"The formula is: (m * (m + 1) / 2)^2\")\nprint(\"---------------------------------------\")\n\n# Calculate each part of the equation step-by-step as requested.\n\n# 1.
