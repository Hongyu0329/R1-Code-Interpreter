    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n1.  **Analyze the Integral**: The integral is `∫ (F₃'(x)/F₃(x)) dx`. This is a standard logarithmic integral form. The integral of `f'(x)/f(x)` is `ln|f(x)|`. In our case, `f(x) = F₃(x)`.\n2.  **Evaluate the Definite Integral**: Applying the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, the definite integral from 0 to 1 is `[ln|F₃(x)|]` from 0 to 1, which equals `ln|F₃(1)| - ln|F₃(0)|`.\n3.  **Calculate F₃(x) at the limits**:\n    *   First, we determine the full expression for `F₃(x)`:\n        *   `F₀(x) = x`\n        *   `F₁(x) = sin(F₀(x)) = sin(x)`\n        *   `F₂(x) = e^(F₁(x)) = e^(sin(x))`\n        *   `F₃(x) = ln(1 + F₂(x)) = ln(1 + e^(sin(x)))`\n    *   Next, we calculate `F₃(1)`: `ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))`.\n    *   Then, we calculate `F₃(0)`: `ln(1 + e^(sin(0))) = ln(1 + e^0) = ln(1 + 1) = ln(2)`.\n    *   Since `e^(sin(x))` is always positive, `1 + e^(sin(x))` is always greater than 1, meaning `F₃(x)` is always positive. Therefore, the absolute value `|F₃(x)|` is equal to `F₃(x)`.\n4.  **Calculate the Value V**: The value of the integral is `V = ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0))`.\n5.  **Final Calculation**: Compute the value of `10000 * V` and find the closest integer.\n6.  **Code Implementation**: Write a Python script to perform these calculations using the `math` library and print the results as requested.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef F3(x):\n  \"\"\"Calculates the value of F₃(x) = ln(1 + e^(sin(x)))\"\"\"\n  return math.log(1 + math.exp(math.sin(x)))\n\n# The integral ∫ (F₃'(x)/F₃(x)) dx from 0 to 1 is equal to ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0)).\n# Let's calculate the components.\n\n# Calculate F₃(1)\nf3_at_1 = F3(1)\n\n# Calculate F₃(0)\nf3_at_0 = F3(0)\n\n# Calculate the value of the integral, V\n# V = ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0))\nV = math.log(f3_at_1) - math.log(f3_at_0)\n\n# The final value to report is the closest integer to 10000 * V\nfinal_value = 10000 * V\nclosest_integer = round(final_value)\n\nprint(\"The integral evaluates to ln|F₃(1)| - ln|F₃(0)|.\")\nprint(f\"F₃(1) = {f3_at_1}\")\nprint(f\"F₃(0) = {f3_at_0}\")\nprint(\"\\nFinal Equation:\")\n# Outputting each number in the final equation for V\nprint(f\"ln({f3_at_1}) - ln({f3_at_0}) = {V}\")\nprint(\"\\nThe value of V is approximately:\", V)\nprint(\"Multiplying by 10000 gives:\", final_value)\nprint(\"The closest integer to this value is:\", closest_integer)\n\nprint(f\"\\nFinal Answer: {closest_integer}\")\n<<<5740>>>\n```"
