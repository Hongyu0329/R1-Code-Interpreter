    # The question describes the shift in the French royal title from
    # "King of the Franks" (a title of a person over a people) to
    # "King of France" (a title of a person over a territory).
    # This was initiated by King Philip II Augustus.

    # --- Part 2: The Epithet and the Biographer ---
    # The monarch's epithet is "Augustus," originally given by the chronicler Rigord.
    # The question asks for the author of the "mainstay biography."
    # In modern English scholarship, the seminal work on Philip II is by John W. Baldwin.

    # --- Evaluation of Choices ---
    # Choice E aligns our key findings: the year 1190 for the shift
    # and Baldwin as the author of the mainstay modern biography.
    # Let's print the breakdown.
