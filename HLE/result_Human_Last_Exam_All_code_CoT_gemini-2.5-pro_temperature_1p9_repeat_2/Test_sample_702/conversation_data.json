    "To determine the connectivity of the map $\\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$, we need to use a result from advanced homotopy theory.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the spaces and the map:**\n    *   The source space is the suspension of the smash product of the loop spaces of $S^4$ and $S^6$.\n    *   The target space is the loop space of the smash product of $S^4$ and $S^6$. Since $S^p \\wedge S^q$ is homotopy equivalent to $S^{p+q}$, the target space is $\\Omega S^{10}$.\n    *   The map is a standard one in homotopy theory, constructed from the Samelson product associated with the inclusions of $S^4$ and $S^6$ into their wedge sum $S^4 \\vee S^6$.\n\n2.  **Apply the relevant theorem:**\n    A theorem by Hajime Oshima provides a formula for the connectivity of precisely this map. For spheres of dimension $p$ and $q$, the connectivity of the map $\\Sigma(\\Omega S^p \\wedge \\Omega S^q) \\to \\Omega S^{p+q}$ is given by the formula:\n    \n    Connectivity = $p + q + \\min(p, q) - 3$\n\n3.  **Perform the calculation:**\n    We will substitute $p=4$ and $q=6$ into the formula to calculate the specific connectivity for the given map.\n\n4.  **Implement in Python:**\n    The python script will define the values for $p$ and $q$, apply the formula, and print out each step of the calculation, including the final equation and the resulting connectivity value.\n\n```python\n# Set the dimensions of the spheres\np = 4\nq = 6\n\n# The connectivity of the map Sigma(Omega S^p wedge Omega S^q) -> Omega(S^p wedge S^q)\n# is given by the formula: p + q + min(p, q) - 3.\n# S^p wedge S^q is homotopy equivalent to S^{p+q}.\n\nprint(\"The connectivity of the map is calculated using the formula: p + q + min(p, q) - 3.\")\nprint(f\"Here, p = {p} and q = {q}.\")\nprint(\"\")\n\n# Calculate the minimum of p and q\nmin_val = min(p, q)\n\n# Calculate the connectivity using the formula\nconnectivity = p + q + min_val - 3\n\n# Print the step-by-step calculation\nprint(\"The final equation is:\")\nprint(f\"Connectivity = {p} + {q} + min({p}, {q}) - 3\")\nprint(f\"Connectivity = {p} + {q} + {min_val} - 3\")\nprint(f\"Connectivity = {p + q + min_val} - 3\")\nprint(f\"Connectivity = {connectivity}\")\n\n# The final answer in the required format is derived from this calculation.\n# print(f\"\\n<<<{connectivity}>>>\")\n```\n<<<11>>>"
