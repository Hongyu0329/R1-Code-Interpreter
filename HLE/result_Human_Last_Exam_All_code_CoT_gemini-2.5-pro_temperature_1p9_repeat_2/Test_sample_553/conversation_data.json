    "Of course. Here is my plan to identify the song:\n1.  I will first interpret the musical theory terms in your request. \"Tonic\" refers to the root chord of the song's key (often denoted as the 'I' chord). The \"minor fifth\" refers to a minor chord built on the fifth scale degree (the 'v' chord), which is a common but distinctive substitution for the more typical major dominant chord ('V').\n2.  I will then search my knowledge base of The Beatles' discography for a song whose opening chord progression matches this specific I -> v (or i -> v) movement.\n3.  The most famous example that fits this description is \"Michelle\" from the album *Rubber Soul*.\n4.  The song's iconic instrumental introduction begins on an F minor chord (the tonic of F minor) and immediately moves to a C minor chord (the minor fifth of F minor).\n5.  I will write a Python script to present this answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_beatles_song():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies and explains the Beatles song that starts with a specific chord progression.\n    \"\"\"\n    song_title = \"Michelle\"\n    key_context = \"F minor\"\n    tonic_chord = \"F minor\"\n    minor_fifth_chord = \"C minor\"\n\n    print(f\"The song by The Beatles that starts with a chord jump from the tonic to the minor fifth chord is '{song_title}'.\")\n    print(\"\\nHere is a brief musical analysis of the song's introduction:\")\n    print(f\"The song's intro is in the key of {key_context}.\")\n    print(f\"It begins on the tonic chord: {tonic_chord} (represented as 'i').\")\n    print(f\"It then jumps to the minor fifth chord: {minor_fifth_chord} (represented as 'v').\")\n    print(\"\\nThis creates the distinctive, melancholic opening that the song is known for.\")\n\nfind_beatles_song()\n```\n<<<Michelle>>>"
