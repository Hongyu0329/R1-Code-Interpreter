    "For a successful multicolor flow cytometry sorting experiment, it's critical to have the right set of controls. These controls ensure that you can properly set up the cytometer, compensate for spectral overlap between fluorophores, and accurately identify your target population(s).\n\nMy plan to calculate the number of essential controls is as follows:\n1.  **Unstained Control:** This is the baseline. You need one tube with just your streptavidin beads to measure their natural autofluorescence.\n2.  **Single-Color Compensation Controls:** To correct for the spectral spillover from each fluorophore into other channels, you need a separate control for each color in your panel. Since you have five fluorophores, you will need five single-color controls.\n3.  **Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls:** These controls are crucial for setting accurate gates, especially for sorting. An FMO control includes all the stains in your panel *except* for one. This reveals the spread of background fluorescence into the \"empty\" channel, allowing you to distinguish between true negative and dim positive signals. You will need one FMO control for each of the five fluorophores.\n\nBy summing the controls from these three categories, we can determine the total number of essential control tubes required for your experiment.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_flow_controls():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of essential controls for a flow cytometry\n    experiment based on the number of fluorophores.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the fluorophores for the five-channel experiment\n    fluorophores = [\"AF350\", \"GFP\", \"PE\", \"AF647\", \"AF750\"]\n    num_fluorophores = len(fluorophores)\n\n    print(\"Calculating the number of essential controls for a 5-color flow cytometry sorting experiment...\\n\")\n\n    # 1.
