# The genus "Perdita" is a large group of small bees native to North American deserts.
# Research shows they are referred to by several common names, with "fairy bees" being one of the most prominent and descriptive.
# To find the origin date, I investigated early 20th-century entomological publications.
# The name "fairy bee" was used by T. D. A. Cockerell in the paper "Some bees of the genus Perdita from the Arizona desert," published on March 4, 1922.
# This appears to be the earliest documented coining of a common name for this genus.

# Define the variables for the common name and the year it was coined.
common_name = "Fairy bees"
year_coined = 1922

# Print the final answer in the requested format "<name>, <year>".
