# The riddle asks to put five numbers in the correct order based on a series of clues.
# Let's break down the clues to find the sequence.

# The numbers involved are 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.

# Clue 1: "Number 1 is the first to have something but is the weakest;"
# This sets the first number in the sequence to 1.
# Sequence: [1, _, _, _, _]

# Clue 2: "...the fifth, who never had a thing and lastly follows."
# This sets the last number in the sequence to 5.
# Sequence: [1, _, _, _, 5]

# Clue 3: "Number three is the strongest and it protects the last;"
# "Protects the last" means 3 is positioned directly before the last number (5).
# Sequence: [1, _, _, 3, 5]

# Clue 4: "Number 4 likes two the most and it always goes behind."
# This means 4 comes directly after 2, forming a (2, 4) block.
# The only available spots for this block are positions 2 and 3.
# Sequence: [1, 2, 4, 3, 5]

# The final derived sequence is 1, 2, 4, 3, 5.
# Let's print each number of the final sequence.
final_sequence = [1, 2, 4, 3, 5]
