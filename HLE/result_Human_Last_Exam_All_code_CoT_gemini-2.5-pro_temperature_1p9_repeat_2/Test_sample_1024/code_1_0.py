# Define the answers for each part based on the reasoning.

# Part A: The Sherlock Holmes allusion is to "The Adventure of the Priory School".
# The key deception in this story was faking cow tracks.
part_a = 6

# Part B: The theme highlighted is the contrast between Holmes's masterful
# deduction (education) and Kinbote's delusional commentary (mis-education).
part_b = 3

# Part C: Nabokov's most intense experience with "meta-textual inter-reference"
# was his massive annotated translation of Pushkin's "Eugene Onegin".
part_c = 7

# Calculate the sum to verify it's a multiple of 8.
total = part_a + part_b + part_c

# Print the final equation as requested, showing each number.
print(f"The final equation is: {part_a} + {part_b} + {part_c} = {total}")

# Print the final answer in the required format.
