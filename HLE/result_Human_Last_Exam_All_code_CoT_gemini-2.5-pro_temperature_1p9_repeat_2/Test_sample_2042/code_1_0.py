The safest and most appropriate action is to convert the laparoscopic procedure to an open one in a controlled manner.

1.  Prying the device open (laparoscopically or open) is risky and could lead to an uncontrolled tear of the cecum.
2.  Resecting a portion of healthy cecum is an unnecessarily large operation with higher risks.
3.  A large midline incision is excessive for this localized problem.
4.  Extending the existing port incision over the appendix provides direct, safe access to the area. This allows the surgeon to resolve the stapler issue and complete the appendectomy under direct vision, which is the safest approach when faced with a significant equipment failure. This is the standard procedure for converting a laparoscopic appendectomy to an open one.
