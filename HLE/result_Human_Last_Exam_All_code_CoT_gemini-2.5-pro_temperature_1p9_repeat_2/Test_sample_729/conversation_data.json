    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is the step-by-step plan to solve the problem, followed by the Python code to calculate the answer.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Understand the Group:** The group in question is the generalized quaternion group of size 128, denoted as $Q_{128}$. This group is a non-abelian group of order $128 = 2^7$. It can be defined by the presentation $Q_{128} = \\langle x, y \\mid x^{64} = 1, y^2 = x^{32}, y^{-1}xy = x^{-1} \\rangle$.\n2.  **Define Power Subgroups:** A subgroup $H$ of a group $G$ is called a power subgroup if there exists an integer $k$ such that $H$ is the set of all $k$-th powers of elements in $G$. This set is denoted as $G^k = \\{g^k \\mid g \\in G\\}$.\n3.  **Identify the Power Subgroups of $Q_{128}$:** For a finite $p$-group like $Q_{128}$ (which is a 2-group), it's a known property that the set of all its power subgroups is given by $\\{G^{2^i} \\mid i = 0, 1, 2, \\dots \\}$. We need to find how many of these are distinct.\n4.  **Calculate the Chain of Power Subgroups:** We will compute the subgroups $Q_{128}^{2^i}$ for increasing values of $i$, starting from $i=0$.\n    *   For $i=0$, we have $Q_{128}^1 = Q_{128}$, the group itself.\n    *   For $i=1$, we get $Q_{128}^2 = \\langle x^2 \\rangle$, a cyclic subgroup of order 32.\n    *   For $i>1$, it can be shown that $Q_{128}^{2^i} = \\langle x^{2^i} \\rangle$.\n    *   This chain of subgroups continues with strictly decreasing orders until it reaches the trivial subgroup $\\{1\\}$.\n5.  **Count the Distinct Subgroups:** We will count the number of unique subgroups in this chain. Since the order of each subgroup in the sequence $Q_{128}, \\langle x^2 \\rangle, \\langle x^4 \\rangle, \\dots, \\{1\\}$ is strictly decreasing, all these subgroups are distinct. The counting stops when we reach the trivial subgroup, which cannot be reduced further.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to find the total number of power subgroups.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of power subgroups in the generalized quaternion group of size 128.\n    \"\"\"\n    group_size = 128\n    \n    # For a generalized quaternion group Q_{2^n}, the group size is 2^n.\n    # We find n by taking log base 2.\n    n = int(math.log2(group_size))\n\n    # The generalized quaternion group Q_{2^n} is given by the presentation:\n    # <x, y | x^(2^(n-1)) = 1, y^2 = x^(2^(n-2)), y*x*y^-1 = x^-1>\n    # For Q_128, n=7.\n    # The exponent of the group is the largest order of any element, which is 2^(n-1) = 64.\n\n    # The power subgroups of a p-group G (like Q_128) are of the form G^(p^i).\n    # Here p=2, so we look at the chain of subgroups Q_128^(2^i).\n    \n    print(f\"The group is Q_{group_size}, which is Q_(2^{n}).\")\n    print(\"We are counting the number of distinct power subgroups.\")\n    print(\"The distinct power subgroups form a chain: G > G^2 > G^4 > G^8 > ... > {1}\")\n    print(\"\\nLet's list these subgroups and their orders:\")\n\n    # i = 0: G^1 = G\n    count = 1\n    order = group_size\n    print(f\"1.
