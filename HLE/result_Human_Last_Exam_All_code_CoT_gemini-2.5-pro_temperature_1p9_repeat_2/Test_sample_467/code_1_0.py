# Step 1: Define the parameters from the problem description.
# The Gauss map is g(z) = z / (z^3 + 2).
# The surface M is conformally equivalent to the complex plane C.

# Step 2: Determine n, the number of poles of g(z) in C.
# The poles are the roots of the denominator: z^3 + 2 = 0.
# The degree of the polynomial z^3 + 2 is 3.
# By the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, there are 3 complex roots.
n = 3

# Step 3: Determine m, the number of zeros of g(z) in C.
# The zeros are the roots of the numerator: z = 0.
# There is one root.
m = 1

# Step 4: Determine k, the number of ends of the surface.
# Since M is conformally equivalent to C, there is one end (at infinity).
k = 1

# Step 5: Calculate the Morse Index using the formula Index = n + m - k.
morse_index = n + m - k

# Step 6: Print the final calculation and result.
print("The Morse index is calculated using the formula: Index = n + m - k")

print(f"Number of zeros of g(z) in C (m) = {m}")
