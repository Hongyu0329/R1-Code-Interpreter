    Calculates the critical exponent nu based on mean-field theory.

    The problem asks for the critical exponent ν for a "G₄-theoretical framework".
    This is interpreted as phi-4 (φ⁴) theory, which belongs to the Ising universality class.
    The '4' hints at the upper critical dimension, d=4, where mean-field theory is exact.

    In mean-field theory, the Gibbs free energy expansion near the critical temperature
    leads to a relationship between the correlation length (ξ) and the reduced
    temperature (t = |T - T_c| / T_c). The relationship is:
      ξ⁻² ∝ t¹

    The definition of the critical exponent ν is:
      ξ ∝ t⁻ᵛ

    Combining these gives:
      (t⁻ᵛ)⁻² ∝ t¹
      t²ᵛ ∝ t¹
      2ν = 1

    This script solves this final equation for ν.
