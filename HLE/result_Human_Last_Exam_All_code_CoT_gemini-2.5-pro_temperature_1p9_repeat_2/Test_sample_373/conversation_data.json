    "To solve this problem, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Model the Graph:** I will first model the specified barbell graph. A standard barbell graph with 10 nodes is constructed from two identical complete graphs (cliques) that are connected by a single bridge edge. This means the 10 nodes are split into two cliques of 5 nodes each.\n2.  **Count the Edges:** I will then calculate the total number of edges in this graph. The total number of edges is the sum of the edges in the first clique, the edges in the second clique, and the single connecting edge, which is the \"bottleneck\". The formula for the number of edges in a complete graph with 'm' nodes is `m * (m - 1) / 2`.\n3.  **Calculate the Probability:** \"Randomized uniform gossiping\" implies that at each step, one edge is selected uniformly at random from the set of all available edges. Therefore, the probability of selecting the specific bottleneck edge is `1 / (total number of edges)`.\n4.  **Generate Code:** Finally, I will provide a Python script that automates these calculations and prints the logic, the numbers used in the final equation, and the resulting probability.\n\n```python\ndef solve_barbell_probability():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the probability of sampling the bottleneck edge in a barbell graph\n    with 10 nodes using uniform gossiping.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
