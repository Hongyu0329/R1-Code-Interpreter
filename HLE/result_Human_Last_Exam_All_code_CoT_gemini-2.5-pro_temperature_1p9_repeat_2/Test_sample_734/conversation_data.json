    "My plan is to first identify the Christian theologian who developed a specific vocabulary to discuss alterations in natural law. This requires knowledge of historical theology. The key is to find a theologian who applied this thinking to both specific miracles, like the virgin birth, and to a fundamental shift in the natural order, such as the one described in the doctrine of the Fall.\n\nThe theologian I have identified is **Augustine of Hippo**. He made a crucial distinction between events that are \"contrary to nature\" (*contra naturam*) and events that are \"beyond what is known of nature\" (*praeter naturam* or *supra naturam*). For Augustine, a miracle like the virgin birth isn't a violation of the ultimate order God created, but an event that operates outside the usual, observable processes of nature. Similarly, the changes to the world after the Fall (e.g., the introduction of death and decay) could be understood as a shift in the operating state of nature, ordained by God as a consequence of sin, rather than a contradiction of His original design. This framework was foundational for later theological discussions on the topic.\n\nI will now write a simple Python script to print this answer.\n\n```python\n# This script identifies and prints the name of the Christian theologian\n# who first developed specialized terminology to describe changes in the laws of nature,\n# applying it to both the virgin birth and the consequences of the Fall.\n\ntheologian_name = \"Augustine of Hippo\"\nprint(theologian_name)\n```\n<<<Augustine of Hippo>>>"
