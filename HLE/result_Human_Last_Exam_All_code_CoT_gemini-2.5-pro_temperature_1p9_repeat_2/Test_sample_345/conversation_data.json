    "I will find the name of the museum by searching online art collection databases. My plan is to identify the artwork \"The Radionist\" by Kurt G端nther and find its acquisition history, specifically for the year 1967. Once found, I will create a Python script to print the name of the museum.\n\n```python\n# This script prints the name of the museum that acquired the specified artwork.\nmuseum_name = \"Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden (Dresden State Art Collections)\"\nartwork_name = \"The Radionist\"\nartist_name = \"Kurt G端nther\"\nacquisition_year = 1967\n\nprint(f'The museum that acquired the painting \"{artwork_name}\" by {artist_name} in {acquisition_year} is:')\nprint(museum_name)\n```\n<<<Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden (Dresden State Art Collections)>>>"
