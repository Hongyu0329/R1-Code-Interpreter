    "Based on my research, the user's question contains a factual inaccuracy. The former President of Nigeria is named Goodluck Ebele Jonathan, not Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan. Nnamdi Azikiwe was a different, prominent Nigerian statesman who served as the first President of Nigeria.\n\nThere is no public record of Goodluck Ebele Jonathan ever identifying himself with the name \"Azikiwe\".\n\nTherefore, I will provide a Python script to clarify this information.\n\n```python\ndef check_name_fact():\n    \"\"\"\n    Addresses the user's question about Goodluck Jonathan and the name 'Azikiwe'.\n    \"\"\"\n    person_in_question = \"Goodluck Ebele Jonathan\"\n    other_historical_figure = \"Nnamdi Azikiwe\"\n\n    print(\"The user's question is based on a common confusion of names.\")\n    print(f\"The full name of the former President of Nigeria is {person_in_question}.\")\n    print(\"His middle name is 'Ebele', not 'Azikiwe'.\")\n    print(f\"'{other_historical_figure}' was the first President of Nigeria, a separate individual.\")\n    print(\"\\nThere are no public records indicating that Goodluck Ebele Jonathan ever publicly identified himself as 'Azikiwe'.\")\n    print(\"Therefore, there is no year in which this event occurred.\")\n\ncheck_name_fact()\n```\n<<<There is no record of Goodluck Ebele Jonathan ever publicly identifying himself as Azikiwe, as that is not part of his name.>>>"

Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
