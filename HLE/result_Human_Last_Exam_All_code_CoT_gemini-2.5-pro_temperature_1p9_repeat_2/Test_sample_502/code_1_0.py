# The problem is about finding the largest possible dimension of a quotient ring R/I,
# which is known as the coinvariant algebra.

# Let G be a finite group acting on a vector space V over the complex numbers C.
# Let R be the ring of polynomial functions on V.
# Let I be the ideal generated by the homogeneous G-invariant polynomials of positive degree.

# According to a fundamental theorem in invariant theory, the dimension of the coinvariant
# algebra R/I is equal to the order of the group G.
# Dimension(R/I) = |G|

# In this problem, the variables are:
# - The polynomial ring is R = C[x_1, ..., x_10]. This means V has dimension 10.
# - The group G is a subgroup of GL_10(C) of order 10000.

group_order = 10000

# Using the theorem, the dimension of R/I is equal to the order of G.
dimension_R_mod_I = group_order

# The question asks for the largest possible dimension of R/I as G varies.
# Since the dimension is always equal to the order of the group, which is fixed at 10000,
# the dimension is constant.
largest_dimension = dimension_R_mod_I

# Final Equation Output:
# The equation for the dimension is: dim(R/I) = |G|
print("The dimension of the quotient ring R/I is given by the order of the group G.")
print(f"The order of group G is |G| = {group_order}")
print(f"Therefore, the dimension of R/I = {dimension_R_mod_I}")
print(f"Since this dimension is constant for any such group G, the largest possible dimension is {largest_dimension}.")
