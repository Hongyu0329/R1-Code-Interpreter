    "To determine the correct hand to jam all-in, we need to consider the key factors: your position, your stack size, and the tournament situation.\n\n**Our Plan:**\n1.  **Analyze the Scenario:**\n    *   **Position:** UTG+1 (Under The Gun + 1) is an early position. We have to be cautious because many players are yet to act behind us.\n    *   **Stack Size:** 16 big blinds (16bb) is a short stack, which means our primary moves are to either fold or go all-in (jam). This is often called a \"push/fold\" stack.\n    *   **Tournament Stage:** We are \"near the money bubble.\" This is a crucial detail. Many opponents will tighten up their calling ranges, afraid to bust out before making the money. This increased \"fold equity\" allows us to profitably jam with a wider range of hands than we normally could.\n\n2.  **Define a Shoving Range:** Based on standard poker strategy for this scenario (early position, 16bb stack, bubble pressure), a typical all-in range would include:\n    *   Medium to high pairs (like 77+)\n    *   Strong Aces (like AJo+, ATs+)\n    *   Strong suited Kings and Queens (like KQs, KJs)\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Options:** We will write a Python script to check each of the provided hands against this standard shoving range and explain the reasoning. The best answer will be the hand that is most clearly and profitably a jam.\n\n```python\ndef poker_hand_analysis():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the poker hand choices for an all-in situation.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
