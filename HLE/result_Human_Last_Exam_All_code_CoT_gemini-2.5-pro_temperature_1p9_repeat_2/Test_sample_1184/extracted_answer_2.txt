1) Hotspots for Interaction (Binding): The key residues on the beta-1 subunit that form the binding pocket for the alpha-1 subunit's Alpha Interaction Domain (AID) are primarily hydrophobic and include Leucine 186 (L186), Valine 223 (V223), Tyrosine 225 (Y225), Methionine 239 (M239), Valine 264 (V264), and Leucine 266 (L266).
2) Hotspots for Gating Modulation: The residues critical for fine-tuning the channel's gating properties include Tryptophan 140 (W140) in the SH3 domain, Aspartate 163 (D163) in the Hook region, Leucine 186 (L186) which has a dual role in binding and modulation, and Aspartate 356 (D356) in the GK domain.
