    "Here is a plan to answer your question.\n1. Identify the key figures and the subject: The evaluator is Liu Ban (刘攽), the poet being evaluated is Zhang Ji (张籍), and the subject is his seven-character poetry (七言诗).\n2. Locate the source of the evaluation: The most likely source for such a critique is a \"shihua\" (诗话, \"poetry talk\"). Liu Ban is known for his work, the *Zhongshan Shihua* (《中山诗话》).\n3. Find the specific entry: I will search within the *Zhongshan Shihua* for Liu Ban's comments on Zhang Ji.\n4. Extract and analyze the text: The original text reads: \"张籍七言诗，拙多于巧，而佳处则尽在于拙。如《征西将》一篇，词虽不甚精，而意极感人，所谓止于至善者也。又《节妇吟》云：‘还君明珠双泪垂，恨不相逢未嫁时。’不过一二句，而曲尽人情物理。非高才，谁能道此？\"\n5. Synthesize the evaluation: I will translate and explain these points clearly in Chinese to form the final answer. The evaluation is highly positive, praising the poems' artless simplicity as their greatest strength, capable of conveying profound emotion and reaching a state of perfection.\n\n<<<北宋学者刘攽在其《中山诗话》中对唐代诗人张籍的七言诗给予了极高的评价。\n\n他的核心评价是：“**张籍七言诗，拙多于巧，而佳处则尽在于拙。**”\n\n具体阐述如下：\n1.  **以“拙”为美**：刘攽认为张籍的七言诗风格朴实无华（拙），胜过了雕琢的技巧（巧），而其真正的妙处和优点，正是在于这种浑然天成的“拙”。他欣赏的是一种返璞归真的自然之美。\n2.  **以《征西将》为例**：他举例说，《征西将》这首诗“词虽不甚精，而意极感人”，意思是虽然语言不够精炼华美，但其表达的情感意蕴却极为感人，达到了“止于至善”的完美境界。\n3.  **以《节妇吟》为例**：他又引用了《节妇吟》中的千古名句“**还君明珠双泪垂，恨不相逢未嫁时**”，称赞这两句诗“曲尽人情物理”（完全道出了人情事理的曲折），并感叹说，如果不是拥有极高才华的人（非高才），是绝对写不出这样的句子的。\n\n总而言之，刘攽认为张籍是一位“高才”，其七言诗的伟大之处不在于辞藻的华丽，而在于以质朴的风格深刻地打动人心，表达复杂的情感和事理。>>>"
