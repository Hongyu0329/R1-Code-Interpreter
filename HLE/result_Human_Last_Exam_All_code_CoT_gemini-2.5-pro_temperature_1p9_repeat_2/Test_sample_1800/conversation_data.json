    "The ideal Nickel to Cerium (Ni/Ce) ratio in Ni-Ceria catalysts is a critical factor for maximizing performance, and it is determined through extensive experimental research. There isn't one single universal value, as the optimal ratio can depend on the specific reaction (Water Gas Shift vs. Water Splitting), reaction conditions, and the catalyst synthesis method.\n\nHowever, scientific literature provides a strong consensus. The goal is to have highly dispersed Nickel nanoparticles on the Ceria support to maximize the active sites at the Ni-CeO₂ interface, which are crucial for the catalytic activity. Too much Nickel leads to the formation of larger particles (sintering) and blocks the active sites on the Ceria support, reducing performance.\n\nBased on numerous studies, a relatively low Nickel content is preferable. An optimal atomic ratio of Nickel to Cerium atoms is often found in the range of 1:9 to 1:4. For the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction specifically, several prominent studies have identified an atomic ratio of **1:4** (or Ni/Ce = 0.25) as being highly effective.\n\nThe following Python script will define and present this ideal ratio, along with the scientific reasoning.\n\n```python\nimport textwrap\n\ndef get_optimal_ni_ce_ratio_info():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides information on the ideal Ni/Ce ratio for catalysis\n    based on scientific literature.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # --- Ideal Ratio Based on Literature ---\n    # The ideal ratio is often expressed as an atomic ratio. Studies show an\n    # optimal range, with a Ni:Ce ratio of 1:4 being highly effective for\n    # reactions like the Water Gas Shift (WGS).\n    ni_atoms = 1\n    ce_atoms = 4\n    \n    # --- Explanation ---\n    explanation = f\"\"\"\nThe ideal atomic ratio of Nickel (Ni) to Cerium (Ce) for Ni-Ceria catalysts is crucial for maximizing performance in reactions like the Water Gas Shift (WGS) and water splitting. While the exact optimum can vary, a widely cited effective ratio is {ni_atoms}:{ce_atoms}.\n\nScientific Rationale:\n1.  Maximizing Active Interface: The catalytic activity heavily relies on the interface between Ni nanoparticles and the Ceria (CeO₂) support. A ratio of {ni_atoms}:{ce_atoms} promotes high dispersion of Ni, creating a large interfacial area.\n2.  Preventing Sintering: Higher concentrations of Nickel can lead to the agglomeration (sintering) of Ni particles at high reaction temperatures, which deactivates the catalyst by reducing the number of active sites. A lower Ni content helps maintain small, stable nanoparticles.\n3.  Synergistic Effect: This ratio facilitates the synergistic effect where the Ceria support provides oxygen vacancies that participate in the catalytic cycle, and the Ni provides sites for reactant adsorption and dissociation.\n\nTherefore, an equation representing this ideal ratio is:\n\"\"\"\n    \n    # --- Print the results ---\n    print(textwrap.dedent(explanation).strip())\n    \n    ratio = ni_atoms / ce_atoms\n    print(\"\\nEquation for the ideal atomic ratio:\")\n    print(f\"Ni atoms / Ce atoms = {ni_atoms} / {ce_atoms} = {ratio}\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    get_optimal_ni_ce_ratio_info()\n```\n<<<0.25>>>"
