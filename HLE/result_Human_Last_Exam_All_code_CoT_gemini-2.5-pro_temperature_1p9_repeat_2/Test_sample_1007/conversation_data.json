    "To determine which ballet step has the same ending leg position as the starting position, we need to analyze the movement of the legs in each option. The \"position\" includes not just the type (e.g., fifth position) but also which foot is in front. A step that ends with the same foot in front as it started is called \"sans changer\" (unchanged).\n\nI will write a Python script to model this. The script will simulate each of the five ballet steps. We'll start with an initial position, for example, the 'Right' foot in front. For each step, a function will determine what the final position is based on the standard execution of that step. The script will then compare the starting and ending positions to find the correct answer.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_ballet_steps():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes classical ballet steps to find which one has the same\n    starting and ending leg position.\n\n    The state is represented by which foot is in front.
