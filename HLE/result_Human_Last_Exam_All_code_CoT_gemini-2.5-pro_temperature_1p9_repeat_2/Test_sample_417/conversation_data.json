    "To determine the number of expected peaks in the 1H NMR spectrum of 1,3,5-tri[((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl)methyl]-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene, we need to count the number of chemically non-equivalent proton environments in the molecule.\n\nHere is the step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Symmetry:** The molecule is constructed symmetrically. It has a central 2,4,6-trimethylbenzene core substituted at the 1,3,5 positions with three identical chiral groups. This arrangement gives the molecule a C3 axis of symmetry. Due to this symmetry, the three arms are chemically equivalent, so we only need to count the number of unique proton signals in the central core and one of the arms.\n\n2.  **Central Core Signals:** The central core is a 2,4,6-trimethylbenzene unit.\n    *   The protons that were on carbons 1, 3, and 5 have been substituted.\n    *   The three methyl groups at positions 2, 4, and 6 are chemically equivalent due to the C3 symmetry. They will produce a single resonance.\n    *   Number of signals from the core = **1**.\n\n3.  **Arm Signals:** We analyze one of the identical `[((...)-yl)methyl]` arms. This arm consists of a methylene (`-CH2-`) bridge and the large chiral ligand.\n    *   **Methylene Bridge (`-CH2-`):** The two protons on the methylene carbon are attached to a chiral molecule. This makes them diastereotopic. Diastereotopic protons are chemically non-equivalent and will resonate at different frequencies, typically splitting each other into a pair of doublets (an AB quartet). Thus, they account for **2** signals.\n    *   **Chiral Ligand Protons:** The ligand is `(4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl`. It's a rigid, chiral bicyclic system.\n        *   **Pyrazole Ring Proton:** There is one proton on the pyrazole ring (at C3). This gives **1** signal.\n        *   **Methyl Groups:** There are three methyl groups. One is on C7, and two are on C8. Since they are in a chiral environment and are not related by any symmetry element, they are all chemically distinct. The two methyls on C8 are diastereotopic. This gives **3** signals.\n        *   **Bicyclic Frame Protons:**\n            *   There is one proton at the bridgehead carbon C4. This gives **1** signal.\n            *   There is a methylene group at C5. Its two protons (exo and endo) are diastereotopic. This gives **2** signals.\n            *   There is a methylene group at C6. Its two protons (exo and endo) are also diastereotopic. This gives **2** signals.\n        *   Total signals from the chiral ligand = 1 (pyrazole H) + 3 (methyls) + 1 (C4-H) + 2 (C5-protons) + 2 (C6-protons) = **9** signals.\n\n4.  **Total Signals:** We sum the signals from all the unique environments.\n    *   Total Signals = (Core signals) + (Bridge signals) + (Ligand signals)\n    *   Total Signals = 1 + 2 + 9 = 12.\n\nThe following Python code calculates and explains this result.\n\n```python\ndef count_nmr_peaks():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of expected 1H NMR peaks for the given molecule based on its structure and symmetry.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
