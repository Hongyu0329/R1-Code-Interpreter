# The problem is to find the constant 'b' in the asymptotic formula 
# C(n) ~ b * n^(3/2) for the expected cover-and-return time on a 
# uniform random tree.
#
# Based on established results in probability theory, particularly from 
# David Aldous's work on the Continuum Random Tree and cited in papers 
# by Cooper and Frieze, the expected cover time averaged over random 
# trees and a uniform random starting vertex has the asymptotic behavior we need.
#
# The formula is E[C(n)] ~ sqrt(pi / 2) * n^(3/2).
#
# From this, we can identify the constant b.

# The equation is C(n) = b * n^(p/q)
# The components of the exponent p/q are:
exponent_numerator = 3
exponent_denominator = 2

# The constant b is given by sqrt(pi / d)
# The components of the expression for b are:
pi_val = math.pi
denominator_for_b = 2

# Calculate the value of b
b = math.sqrt(pi_val / denominator_for_b)
