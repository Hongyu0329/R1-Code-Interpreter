    "My plan to solve this organic chemistry problem is as follows:\n1.  **Identify Reactants**: I will first identify the two molecules involved in the Wittig reaction from the user's prompt: an aldehyde and a phosphonium ylide.\n2.  **Deconstruct Reactant Names**: I'll parse the chemical names to determine the precise molecular structures.\n    *   Pivalaldehyde is `(CH₃)₃C-CHO`.\n    *   The ylide, `(2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-l5-phosphane`, has the structure `(o-Cl-C₆H₄)-CH₂-CH=PPh₃`.\n3.  **Apply Wittig Reaction Logic**: The core of the Wittig reaction is the formation of a carbon-carbon double bond. The `C=O` group from the aldehyde and the `C=PPh₃` group from the ylide are swapped out to form a `C=C` bond and a stable byproduct, triphenylphosphine oxide (`O=PPh₃`).\n4.  **Assemble the Product**: I will combine the relevant fragments from the reactants: `(CH₃)₃C-CH` from pivalaldehyde and `CH-CH₂-(o-Cl-C₆H₄)` from the ylide. This yields the product's structure: `(CH₃)₃C-CH=CH-CH₂-(o-Cl-C₆H₄)`.\n5.  **Determine the IUPAC Name**: I will determine the systematic IUPAC name for the resulting alkene. This involves finding the longest carbon chain containing the double bond, numbering it correctly, and identifying all substituents. The correct name is `1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene`.\n6.  **Construct the Code**: I will write a Python script that lays out this process, clearly defines the reactants and products, and prints the final balanced chemical equation. As per the user's specific instruction, the script will also separately print each numerical locant found in the product's IUPAC name.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Define the reactants for the Wittig reaction.\naldehyde_name = \"pivalaldehyde\"\naldehyde_structure_condensed = \"(CH3)3C-CHO\"\n\nylide_name = \"(2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-l5-phosphane\"\nylide_structure_condensed = \"(2-Cl-C6H4)-CH2-CH=PPh3\"\n\n# Step 2: Explain the mechanism of the Wittig reaction.\n# The C=O double bond of the aldehyde and the C=PPh3 double bond of the ylide\n# are replaced by a new C=C double bond, forming an alkene.\n# The oxygen from the aldehyde and the PPh3 from the ylide combine to form the byproduct.\naldehyde_fragment = \"(CH3)3C-CH\"\nylide_fragment = \"CH-CH2-(2-Cl-C6H4)\"\nbyproduct_structure = \"O=PPh3\"\nbyproduct_name = \"triphenylphosphine oxide\"\n\n# Step 3: Form the product by combining the fragments.\nproduct_structure = f\"{aldehyde_fragment}={ylide_fragment}\"\n\n# Step 4: Determine the IUPAC name for the product.\n# The longest carbon chain containing the double bond is a pentene.\n# Numbering from the right gives the double bond the lowest number (position 2).\n# The substituents are a (2-chlorophenyl) group at position 1 and two methyl groups at position 4.\nproduct_iupac_name = \"1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene\"\n\n# Step 5: Display the full reaction equation.\nprint(\"--- Wittig Reaction ---\")\nprint(f\"Aldehyde: {aldehyde_name} ({aldehyde_structure_condensed})\")\nprint(f\"Ylide: {ylide_name} ({ylide_structure_condensed})\")\nprint(\"\\n--- Product Formation ---\")\nprint(f\"The reaction yields the alkene and a byproduct:\")\nprint(f\"Product: {product_structure}\")\nprint(f\"IUPAC Name: {product_iupac_name}\")\nprint(f\"Byproduct: {byproduct_structure} ({byproduct_name})\")\nprint(\"\\n--- Final Equation ---\")\nprint(f\"{aldehyde_structure_condensed} + {ylide_structure_condensed} ---> {product_structure} + {byproduct_structure}\")\n\n# Final Step: Output each number from the product's IUPAC name as requested.\nprint(\"\\nThe numbers in the final product's IUPAC name are:\")\nprint(\"1\")\nprint(\"2\")\nprint(\"4,4\")\nprint(\"2\")\n```\n<<<1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene>>>"
