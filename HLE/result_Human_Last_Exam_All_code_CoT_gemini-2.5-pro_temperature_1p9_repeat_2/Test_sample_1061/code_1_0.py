A long-term strengthening of the monsoon would lead to wetter conditions and less water stress. This allows trees to keep their stomata open, enhancing discrimination against 13C and causing a DECLINE in the 13C ratio. Among the choices, this is the only large-scale environmental factor that correctly predicts the direction of the trend. Therefore, it is the most plausible answer."
