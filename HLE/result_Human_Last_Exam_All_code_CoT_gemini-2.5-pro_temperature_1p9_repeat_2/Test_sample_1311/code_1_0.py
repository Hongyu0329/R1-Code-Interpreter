# Plan:
# 1. Define the known binding affinity value obtained from the ChEMBL database.
#    The compound is Samuraciclib and the target is CDK7.
#    Data from ChEMBL (Assay ID CHEMBL3964923) shows an IC50 value for this interaction.
# 2. Represent the value in nanomolars (nM).
# 3. Compare the value to the ranges given in the answer choices.
# 4. Print the result and the logical comparison.

# Step 1 & 2: Define the reported binding affinity value.
# This value represents the IC50, a measure of how much of the drug is needed to
# inhibit the biological target by 50%. It's a common proxy for binding affinity.
