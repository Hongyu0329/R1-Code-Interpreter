    "To find the total welfare, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Find Market Equilibrium**: The market is in equilibrium when the quantity supplied equals the quantity demanded (`Q_S = Q_D = Q_e`). At this point, the supply price also equals the demand price (`P_e`). We can find this equilibrium point by setting the supply and demand equations equal to each other:\n    `ln(Q_e^3 - 2) = 18 * e^(-arctan(Q_e))`\n    This equation is complex and must be solved numerically for the equilibrium quantity `Q_e`. Once we have `Q_e`, we can calculate the equilibrium price `P_e` by plugging `Q_e` into either function.\n\n2.  **Calculate Total Welfare**: Total welfare is the sum of consumer surplus and producer surplus. It represents the total benefit to society and can be calculated as the area between the demand curve and the supply curve up to the equilibrium quantity.\n    *   Total Welfare = (Area under the demand curve) - (Area under the supply curve).\n    *   Area under Demand Curve = `∫[0 to Q_e] P_D(Q) dQ = ∫[0 to Q_e] (18 * e^(-arctan(Q))) dQ`\n    *   Area under Supply Curve = `∫[Q_min to Q_e] P_S(Q) dQ = ∫[cbrt(2) to Q_e] (ln(Q^3 - 2)) dQ`\n        *Note: The supply function `P = ln(Q^3 - 2)` is only defined for `Q^3 - 2 > 0`, so `Q > cuberoot(2)`. This is the lower limit for the supply integral.*\n\n3.  **Execute the Plan**: The following Python code uses the `scipy` library to perform the numerical calculations: `root_scalar` to find `Q_e` and `quad` to perform the integrations for the areas under the curves. It will then calculate and print the values for the final welfare equation.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import root_scalar\nfrom scipy.integrate import quad\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script calculates the total welfare based on given supply and demand functions.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.

Calculate Total Welfare\n    # Total Welfare = (Area under Demand from 0 to Q_e) - (Area under Supply from Q_min to Q_e)\n\n    # Area under the demand curve from Q=0 to Q_e\n    area_demand, _ = quad(demand_p, 0, q_e)\n\n    # Area under the supply curve from its start (Q_min) to Q_e\n    area_supply, _ = quad(supply_p, q_min_supply, q_e)\n\n    # Calculate consumer and producer surplus for completeness\n    consumer_surplus = area_demand - p_e * q_e\n    producer_surplus = p_e * q_e - area_supply\n\n    # Total Welfare = Consumer Surplus + Producer Surplus\n    total_welfare = consumer_surplus + producer_surplus\n\n    # 4.
