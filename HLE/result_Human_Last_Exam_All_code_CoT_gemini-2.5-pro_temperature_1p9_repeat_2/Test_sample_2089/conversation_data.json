    "Of course. I can help with that.\n\nThe film you're referring to is *The Godfather Part II*. The character is Fredo Corleone. During the New Year's Eve party in Havana, Cuba, as the revolution forces them to flee, Michael Corleone realizes Fredo has betrayed him. Fredo, trying to get away, boards a bus. An associate of Michael's rival, Hyman Roth, says to Fredo, \"Michael Corleone says hello.\" Fredo's flustered response, \"Thank you,\" confirms to the watching Michael that Fredo knows this man and is indeed the traitor. This act seals his fate.\n\nTo meet the requirements of your request, I will provide a Python script that prints this answer and also provides a simple equation related to the film series, showing each number as requested. The equation will be formed using the release years of the first two films in the trilogy.\n\n```python\ndef solve_trivia():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides the answer to the film trivia question and\n    displays an equation as requested.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Information about the film\n    film_title = \"The Godfather Part II\"\n    character_name = \"Fredo Corleone\"\n    \n    # Numbers for the equation\n    release_year_part_2 = 1974\n    release_year_part_1 = 1972\n    resultant_part_number = 2\n    \n    # Print the answer to the user's question\n    print(f\"The Oscar-nominated film is '{film_title}'.\")\n    print(f\"In the film, the character {character_name} seals his fate by saying \\\"Thank you\\\" while boarding a bus.\")\n    \n    # Print the equation as requested\n    print(\"\\nHere is an equation using numbers related to the film series:\")\n    print(f\"{release_year_part_2} - {release_year_part_1} = {resultant_part_number}\")\n\n# Execute the function\nsolve_trivia()\n```\n<<<The Godfather Part II>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    In which Oscar-nominated film does a character seal his fate by saying \"Thank you\" while boarding a bus?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
