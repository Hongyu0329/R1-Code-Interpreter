CAR T cells manufactured with interleukin-15 would be predicted to exhibit enhanced cytokine release upon target antigen recognition compared to T cells manufactured without interleukin-15. This would manifest as significantly higher secretion of key effector cytokines such as Interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-α), reflecting a more potent anti-tumor functional state.
