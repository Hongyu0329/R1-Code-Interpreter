    "Trisyllabic laxing is a phonological rule in English where a tense (long) vowel becomes lax (short) when it is in the antepenultimate (third-to-last) syllable of a word. To solve this, I will analyze each word to see if it shows evidence of this sound change relative to its base form.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  For each word in the list, I will identify its simpler base word (e.g., for `serenity`, the base is `serene`).\n2.  I will compare the vowel sound in the relevant syllable of the base word with the vowel sound in the derived word.\n3.  I will check if the syllable count of the derived word is three or more, making the rule applicable.\n4.  The word that does not show this pattern of a tense vowel becoming lax due to suffixation will be the answer. Specifically, I'm looking for a word that either retains a long vowel or was not derived in a way that would trigger the rule in the first place.\n\nThe following Python code executes this analysis.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_trisyllabic_laxing():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes a list of words to determine which has not undergone\n    trisyllabic laxing.\n    \"\"\"\n    word_analysis = {\n        \"southern\": {\n            \"base_word\": \"south\",\n            \"base_vowel\": \"/aʊ/\",\n            \"derived_vowel\": \"/ʌ/\",\n            \"syllables\": 2,\n            \"analysis\": \"Vowel laxing occurred (from /aʊ/ to /ʌ/), but in a two-syllable word.
