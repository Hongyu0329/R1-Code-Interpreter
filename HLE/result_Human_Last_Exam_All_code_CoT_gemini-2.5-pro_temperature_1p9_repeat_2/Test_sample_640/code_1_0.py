# The problem asks to identify all correct statements about two-channel quantum scattering.
# Based on the analysis of the relationships between the potential matrix V(r),
# the Jost matrix F(E), and the scattering matrix S(E), the following conclusions were reached:

# Statement 1: Correct. A nontrivially coupled potential is required to produce a nontrivially coupled S-matrix.
# Statement 2: Correct. A diagonal S-matrix implies no scattering between channels, which requires a diagonal potential (uniqueness of inverse scattering).
# Statement 3: Correct. Follows from the chain: V(nontrivial) -> S(nontrivial) -> F(nontrivial).
# Statement 4: Correct. Follows from the chain: S(trivial) -> V(trivial) -> F(trivial), then taking the contrapositive.
# Statement 5: Incorrect. A diagonal Jost matrix implies a trivially coupled potential, which contradicts the statement's premise.
