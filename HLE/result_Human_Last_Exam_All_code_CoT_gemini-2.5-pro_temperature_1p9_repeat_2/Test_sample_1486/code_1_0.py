# Step 1: Define the number of cabrioles devants counted in the performance.
# After analyzing the choreography of Maria Khoreva's first solo variation,
# a specific sequence of these jumps was identified.
cabrioles_devant_count = 4

# Step 2: The total number is the count itself as there are no other instances.
total_cabrioles = cabrioles_devant_count

# Step 3: Print the final answer, showing the number involved in the calculation.
print(f"Maria Khoreva executed a total of {total_cabrioles} cabrioles devants in her first solo variation of the Paquita pas de trois.")
