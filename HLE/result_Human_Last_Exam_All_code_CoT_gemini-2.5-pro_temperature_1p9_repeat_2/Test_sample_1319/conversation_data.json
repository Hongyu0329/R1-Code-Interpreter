    "To determine the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the Iliad after Mount Olympus, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify Relevant Mountains:** I'll compile a list of mountains that are mentioned in the Iliad and are actual, historical locations. These include Mount Olympus, Mount Athos, Mount Ida (of Troad), and Mount Samothrace.\n2.  **Gather Elevation Data:** I will find the official elevation (in meters) for each of these mountains.\n3.  **Implement a Python Script:** I'll write a script to perform the comparison.\n    *   The script will store the mountains and their heights in a dictionary for easy access.\n    *   It will remove 'Mount Olympus' from the dictionary to exclude it from the final comparison, as requested.\n    *   It will then find the mountain with the maximum height among the remaining entries.\n    *   Finally, it will print the list of compared mountains with their heights and announce the tallest one.\n\n```python\ndef find_tallest_mountain():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the Iliad, excluding Mount Olympus.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A dictionary of prominent mountains from the Iliad and their real-world elevations in meters.\n    mountains = {\n        \"Mount Olympus\": 2918,\n        \"Mount Athos\": 2033,\n        \"Mount Ida (Troad)\": 1774,\n        \"Mount Samothrace\": 1611\n    }\n\n    print(\"Finding the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the Iliad (after Mount Olympus).\\n\")\n    print(\"The historical mountains and their elevations are:\")\n    # Create a new dictionary without Mount Olympus for the comparison\n    historical_mountains_for_comparison = {name: height for name, height in mountains.items() if name != \"Mount Olympus\"}\n\n    # Print each mountain being compared\n    for name, height in historical_mountains_for_comparison.items():\n        print(f\"- {name}: {height} m\")\n\n    # Find the mountain with the maximum height from the filtered list\n    tallest_mountain_name = max(historical_mountains_for_comparison, key=historical_mountains_for_comparison.get)\n    tallest_mountain_height = historical_mountains_for_comparison[tallest_mountain_name]\n\n    # Forming the \"equation\" or comparison string\n    comparison_values = sorted(historical_mountains_for_comparison.values(), reverse=True)\n    comparison_string = \" > \".join(map(str, comparison_values))\n    \n    print(f\"\\nThe height comparison is: {comparison_string}\")\n    print(f\"\\nThe tallest mountain after Mount Olympus is {tallest_mountain_name}.\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    find_tallest_mountain()\n```\n<<<Mount Athos>>>"
