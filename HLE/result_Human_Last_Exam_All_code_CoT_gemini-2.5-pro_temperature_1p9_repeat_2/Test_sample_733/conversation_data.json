    "To solve this problem, I will determine the number of finite groups that possess a maximal by inclusion product-free set of size 2.\n\n### Step-by-step plan:\n\n1.  **Define a \"Product-Free Set\"**: A non-empty subset `S` of a group `G` is called product-free if for any two elements `x, y` in `S` (including when `x=y`), their product `xy` is not in `S`. This is equivalent to the condition `S \\cap SS = \\emptyset`.\n\n2.  **Define a \"Maximal by Inclusion Product-Free Set\"**: A product-free set `S` is maximal by inclusion (or just \"maximal\") if it's not a proper subset of any other product-free set in `G`. This means for any element `g` in `G` but not in `S`, the new set `S \\cup \\{g\\}` is *not* product-free.\n\n3.  **The Goal**: We need to find how many distinct isomorphism classes of finite groups `G` contain at least one maximal product-free set `S` where `|S| = 2`.\n\n4.  **Computational Approach**: I will write a Python program to solve this. The program will:\n    a. Implement a function that takes a group's structure (specifically, its Cayley table) as input.\n    b. This function will iterate through all subsets `S` of size 2.\n    c. For each `S`, it first checks if `S` is product-free.\n    d. If `S` is product-free, it then checks if `S` is maximal by testing every element `g \\in G \\setminus S`.\n    e. The program will test all non-isomorphic groups up to a reasonable order (e.g., order 10) to identify the ones that satisfy the condition.\n\n5.  **Implementation Details**:\n    *   The groups will be represented by their Cayley (multiplication) tables.\n    *   I will pre-compute the tables for all non-isomorphic groups up to order 8, as this is where the known examples reside.\n    *   The code will print the names of the groups that satisfy the condition and provide a final count.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements this plan:\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef is_product_free(s, group_table, elements):\n    \"\"\"Checks if a set S is product-free.\"\"\"\n    s_indices = {elements.index(item) for item in s}\n    for x_idx in s_indices:\n        for y_idx in s_indices:\n            product_idx = group_table[x_idx][y_idx]\n            if elements[product_idx] in s:\n                return False\n    return True\n\ndef has_maximal_product_free_set_of_size_2(group_name, group_table):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a group has a maximal by inclusion product-free set of size 2.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = len(group_table)\n    elements = list(range(n))\n\n    # Iterate over all subsets of size 2\n    for s_tuple in itertools.combinations(elements, 2):\n        s = set(s_tuple)\n\n        # 1. Check if S is product-free\n        if not is_product_free(s, group_table, elements):\n            continue\n\n        # 2.
