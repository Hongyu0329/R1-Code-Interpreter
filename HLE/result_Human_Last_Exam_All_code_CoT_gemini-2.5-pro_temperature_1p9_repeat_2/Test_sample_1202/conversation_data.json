    "My plan is to analyze each of the provided options to determine the most suitable mechanism for the retention and divergence of duplicate genes. I will systematically evaluate each choice, eliminating the incorrect ones and then comparing the most plausible options to arrive at the final answer.\n\n1.  **Analyze the question:** The core of the question is to identify the most probable mechanism that explains two outcomes after a gene duplication event: 1) **Retention** (the gene copy is not lost) and 2) **Divergence** (the two gene copies become different over time).\n\n2.  **Evaluate each choice:**\n    *   **A. Gene conversion:** This process homogenizes sequences, making them more similar. This works against divergence, so it is incorrect.\n    *   **B. Pseudogenization:** This is when a gene copy becomes non-functional. While this is a very common fate for duplicated genes, it represents a failure to be retained in a functional form. Therefore, it's not a mechanism for retention.\n    *   **E. Adaptive radiation:** This is a macroevolutionary pattern of species diversification, not a molecular mechanism of gene evolution. It's the wrong level of analysis.\n    *   This leaves us with two main competing models: Neofunctionalization and Subfunctionalization.\n\n3.  **Compare C and D:**\n    *   **C. Neofunctionalization:** Proposes that one gene copy keeps the original function, while the other acquires a completely new function through mutation. This explains both retention (the new function is beneficial) and divergence. However, this relies on a rare beneficial mutation occurring before the redundant copy is silenced by other mutations.\n    *   **D. Subfunctionalization:** Proposes that the ancestral gene had multiple functions (or expression patterns). After duplication, each copy loses a different sub-function through mutation. Now, both copies are required to perform the original, complete set of functions. This model provides a direct path to retention because as soon as complementary functions are lost, selection acts to preserve both copies.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** The main challenge for a new duplicate gene is to avoid becoming a pseudogene (Choice B). Subfunctionalization provides a more immediate and probable route to retention than neofunctionalization because it relies on relatively common degenerative mutations to make both copies indispensable. Neofunctionalization requires a much rarer gain-of-function mutation to occur. Therefore, subfunctionalization is often considered the more likely mechanism for the initial preservation and subsequent divergence of duplicate genes.\n\n```python\nimport textwrap\n\ndef analyze_gene_duplication_fates():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the potential mechanisms for the retention and divergence of duplicate genes.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    title = \"Analysis of Mechanisms for Duplicate Gene Retention\"\n    print(title)\n    print(\"=\" * len(title))\n\n    # Define the options\n    options = {\n        'A': 'Gene conversion: A process that makes gene copies identical, preventing divergence.',\n        'B': 'Pseudogenization: The inactivation of a gene copy, which is a failure of retention, not a mechanism for it.',\n        'C': 'Neofunctionalization: One copy retains the original function, while the other evolves a new one.',\n        'D': 'Subfunctionalization: The original functions of an ancestral gene are partitioned between the two copies.',\n        'E': 'Adaptive radiation: A pattern of species evolution, not a molecular mechanism for genes.'\n    }\n\n    # Step 1: Eliminate incorrect options\n    print(\"\\nStep 1: Evaluating and eliminating unlikely options.\\n\")\n    print(f\"Choice {list(options.keys())[0]} ({options['A']}) is incorrect because it works against divergence.\")\n    print(f\"Choice {list(options.keys())[1]} ({options['B']}) is the most common fate (loss), not a mechanism for retention of function.\")\n    print(f\"Choice {list(options.keys())[4]} ({options['E']}) is a macroevolutionary concept, not a molecular mechanism.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Compare the main contenders\n    print(\"Step 2: Comparing the two primary models for retention: Neofunctionalization and Subfunctionalization.\\n\")\n    \n    neofunc_desc = textwrap.fill(\n        f\"Neofunctionalization (C): In this model, one gene copy maintains the ancestral function, while the second copy is free to accumulate mutations.
