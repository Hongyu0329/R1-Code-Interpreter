# Final Answer
# The mechanism described in option D, Subfunctionalization, is considered most likely.
# The original gene has multiple functions: Function 1 and Function 2.
# After duplication, Gene Copy A might perform Function 1.
# Gene Copy B might perform Function 2.
# Both are now required, ensuring retention. The final answer is D.
