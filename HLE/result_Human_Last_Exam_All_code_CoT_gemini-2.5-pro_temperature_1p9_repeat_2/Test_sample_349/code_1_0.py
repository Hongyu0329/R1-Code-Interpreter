# The problem is asking for the smallest 'z' that satisfies the given matrix
# decomposition property. This value is known to be the Grothendieck constant, K_G.
# While the exact value of K_G is unknown, a tight and famous upper bound,
# conjectured to be the true value, is given by Krivine's formula:
# K_G <= pi / (2 * ln(1 + sqrt(2)))
# This script calculates the value of this upper bound.

# As per the instruction to output each number in the final equation,
# the numbers involved in Krivine's formula are pi, 2, and 1.
print("Numbers in the calculation for Krivine's bound:")
print(f"The value of pi is: {math.pi}")
print("The value of 2 is: 2")

print("------------------------------------------")

# Calculate the value of the bound
pi_val = math.pi
two_val = 2
one_val = 1

sqrt_2 = math.sqrt(two_val)
log_arg = one_val + sqrt_2
denominator = two_val * math.log(log_arg)
krivine_bound = pi_val / denominator

print(f"The equation for Krivine's bound is: pi / (2 * ln(1 + sqrt(2)))")
print(f"The calculated numerical value of this bound is: {krivine_bound}")

# This calculated value (~1.7822) is very close to option C (1.783), which is a
# rounded-up approximation. However, the exact answer to the question is the
# symbolic constant K_G itself.
