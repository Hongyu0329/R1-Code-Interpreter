    "In statistical mechanics, the equilibrium state of a system is the macrostate with the highest probability, which corresponds to the state with the maximum entropy, subject to physical constraints like fixed total energy. Large deviation theorems, such as the Boltzmann-Sanov theorem, provide the formal mathematical foundation for this principle. They show that the probability of observing a macroscopic configuration far from the one that maximizes entropy is exponentially small.\n\nWe will find the equilibrium properties for a gas of photons (light quanta), which are bosons. The key characteristics are:\n1.  Photons are indistinguishable bosons.\n2.  The number of photons is not conserved (their chemical potential is zero, µ=0).\n3.  The system has a set of discrete energy levels `ε_i` with degeneracies `g_i` (meaning `g_i` states have the same energy `ε_i`).\n4.  The system is in thermal equilibrium at a temperature T, which implies a fixed average total energy `U`.\n\nOur plan is to find the particle distribution `{n_i}` that maximizes the entropy `S` for a given total energy `U = Σ n_i ε_i`. This most probable distribution is the equilibrium distribution. From this, we will derive the equilibrium expressions for the mean energy `U` and entropy `S`.\n\nThe python script below will print out the final, derived equations for the equilibrium state.\n\n```python\ndef solve_bose_equilibrium():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains and prints the equilibrium equations for mean energy\n    and entropy for the Bose case of light quanta, derived from the principle\n    of maximum entropy.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"--- Equilibrium Properties for a Photon Gas (Bose-Einstein Statistics) ---\")\n    print(\"\\nBased on the principle of maximizing entropy (formally justified by large deviation theory),\")\n    print(\"we can derive the equilibrium properties of a photon gas at temperature T.\")\n    print(\"\\n--- Key Variables ---\")\n    print(\"  ε_i: Energy of the i-th energy level\")\n    print(\"  g_i: Degeneracy of the i-th energy level (number of states with energy ε_i)\")\n    print(\"  k_B: Boltzmann's constant (approximately 1.38e-23 J/K)\")\n    print(\"  T:   Absolute temperature of the system in Kelvin\")\n    print(\"  <n_i>: Equilibrium average number of photons in the i-th energy level\")\n    print(\"\\n--- 1.
