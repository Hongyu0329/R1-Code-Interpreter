    step1 = "1. The key problem with limited recombination is the accumulation of deleterious mutations over time, a process known as Muller's Ratchet."
    step2 = "2. A 'compensatory mechanism' must therefore provide robustness against these mutations, for instance by providing backup copies of genes."
    step3 = "3. Let's evaluate the options based on this requirement:"
    analysis_a = "   - (A) Tandem repeats do not provide functional backups for genes."
    analysis_b = "   - (B) Chromosomal inversions *suppress* recombination, they don't compensate for a lack of it."
    analysis_c = "   - (C) Transposable elements are often mutagenic themselves and not a solution."
    analysis_d = "   - (D) Multigene families arise from gene duplication and provide redundancy, which is a plausible mechanism."
    analysis_e = "   - (E) Polyploidy (having multiple sets of chromosomes) provides massive, genome-wide gene redundancy. If a gene is lost to mutation on one chromosome, functional copies exist on the others."
    step4 = "4. Comparing D and E: Polyploidy is a major genome-wide architectural feature strongly associated with long-term asexual lineages. It offers a powerful and immediate buffer against Muller's ratchet, making it the best-described compensatory mechanism among the choices."
