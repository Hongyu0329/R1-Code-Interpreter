    "This is a problem that can be solved using the properties of the Fourier transform on Schwartz functions. The answer is yes, the function must be the zero function.\n\nHere is my plan to demonstrate this:\n1.  Define the Fourier transform, $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$, of the function $f(x)$. A key property is that the Fourier transform of a Schwartz function is also a Schwartz function.\n2.  Calculate the k-th derivative of the Fourier transform, $\\hat{f}^{(k)}(\\xi)$.\n3.  Evaluate these derivatives at $\\xi = 0$ and show that they are directly proportional to the moments of the original function $f(x)$, i.e., $\\int_{\\mathbb{R}} x^k f(x) \\, dx$.\n4.  Use the given condition that all moments are zero to show that all derivatives of $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$ at $\\xi = 0$ are also zero.\n5.  A Schwartz function is not only smooth but also analytic. This means it is equal to its Taylor series expansion around any point. Since all Taylor coefficients of $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$ at $\\xi=0$ are zero, the function $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$ must be identically zero.\n6.  Finally, by the injectivity of the Fourier transform on the space of Schwartz functions, if $\\hat{f}=0$, then $f$ must also be the zero function.\n\nI will now provide a Python script that prints out this reasoning step-by-step.\n\n```python\ndef solve_schwartz_function_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script explains the solution to the following problem:\n    Suppose f: R -> R is a Schwartz class function such that the integral of x^k * f(x)\n    over R is 0 for all non-negative integers k.
