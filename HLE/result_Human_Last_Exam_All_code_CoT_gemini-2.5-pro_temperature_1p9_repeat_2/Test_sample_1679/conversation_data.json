    "To answer this question, I will first identify the locations of the Luxor Obelisks. There are two: one in Luxor, Egypt, and one in the Place de la Concorde in Paris, France. Then, I will review a chronological list of Academy Award for Best Picture winners to find the first film that features either of these locations.\n\nMy plan is to create a Python script that will:\n1.  Store a list of early Best Picture winners along with relevant location information (e.g., if it's set in Paris or Egypt).\n2.  Iterate through this list chronologically.\n3.  Check each film for the presence of the key locations.\n4.  Stop and identify the first film that meets the criteria.\n5.  Print the name of the movie as the final answer.\n\nThe most likely candidates will be films set in Paris, as the obelisk in the Place de la Concorde is a famous landmark.\n\n```python\ndef find_first_winner_with_obelisk():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the first Academy Award Best Picture winner to depict a Luxor Obelisk.\n    The script uses a pre-researched list of early winners and their settings.\n    One Luxor Obelisk is in Luxor, Egypt.
