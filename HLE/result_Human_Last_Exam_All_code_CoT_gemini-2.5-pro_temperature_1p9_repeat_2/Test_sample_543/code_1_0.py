# The reaction described is a multiple Grignard cross-coupling reaction.
# 1. Starting material: 1,3-dibromo-2-iodobenzene
# 2. Reagent: Excess phenyl magnesium bromide (PhMgBr)
# 3. Conditions: Reflux in THF, followed by aqueous work-up.

# The reactivity of the carbon-halogen bonds is I > Br.
# Step 1: The iodine at position 2 is replaced by a phenyl group.
# Step 2: Since the PhMgBr is in excess and the reaction is heated (reflux),
#         the two less-reactive bromine atoms at positions 1 and 3 are also replaced by phenyl groups.

# The final product is a benzene ring with phenyl groups at positions 1, 2, and 3.
# IUPAC name: 1,2,3-triphenylbenzene
