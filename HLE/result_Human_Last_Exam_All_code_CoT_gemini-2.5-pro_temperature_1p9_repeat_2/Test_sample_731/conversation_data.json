    "To find the number of power subgroups in the semidihedral group of size 512, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the Group and its Properties**: The group is the semidihedral group $SD_{512}$. This group is of the form $SD_{2^n}$ where $n=9$. A standard presentation is $\\langle r, s \\mid r^{2^{n-1}} = 1, s^2 = 1, srs = r^{2^{n-2}-1} \\rangle$. For $n=9$, this becomes $\\langle r, s \\mid r^{256} = 1, s^2 = 1, srs = r^{127} \\rangle$.\n\n2.  **Determine the Group Exponent**: The exponent of a group is the least common multiple (LCM) of the orders of all its elements.\n    *   The elements in the cyclic subgroup $\\langle r \\rangle$ have orders that are divisors of 256. The maximum order is 256.\n    *   The other elements are of the form $sr^i$. Their orders can be shown to be either 2 or 4.\n    *   The exponent of $SD_{512}$ is therefore $\\text{lcm}(256, 4) = 256$.\n\n3.  **Identify Power Subgroups**: A power subgroup is a subgroup of the form $G^d = \\langle g^d \\mid g \\in G \\rangle$ for some integer $d$. The number of distinct power subgroups is found by examining $G^d$ for all $d$ that are divisors of the group's exponent. The divisors of the exponent 256 are $1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256$.\n\n4.  **Count the Distinct Subgroups**: We analyze the structure of $G^d$ for each divisor $d$:\n    *   $G^1 = SD_{512}$, with order 512.\n    *   $G^2 = \\langle r^2 \\rangle$, a cyclic subgroup of order 128.\n    *   $G^4 = \\langle r^4 \\rangle$, a cyclic subgroup of order 64.\n    *   In general, for $d=2^k$ where $k \\geq 1$, we can show that $G^{2^k}$ is a cyclic subgroup generated by a power of $r$. For $k \\geq 2$, $G^{2^k} = \\langle r^{2^k} \\rangle$.\n    *   The resulting subgroups are $\\{SD_{512}, \\langle r^2 \\rangle, \\langle r^4 \\rangle, \\dots, \\langle r^{128} \\rangle, \\{1\\}\\}$. Each of these subgroups has a different order (512, 128, 64, ..., 2, 1), so they are all distinct.\n\n5.  **Final Count**: Since each divisor of the exponent 256 gives a unique power subgroup, the total number of power subgroups is equal to the number of divisors of 256. Since $256 = 2^8$, it has $8+1=9$ divisors.\n\nThe following Python code implements this logic to calculate the answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_semidihedral_power_subgroups():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the number of power subgroups in the semidihedral\n    group of size 512.\n    \"\"\"\n    group_size = 512\n    \n    # Step 1: Identify the group parameters based on its size.\n    # The semidihedral group SD_N has size N = 2^n.\n    # For N = 512 = 2^9, we have n = 9.\n    n = int(math.log2(group_size))\n    \n    print(f\"The semidihedral group SD_{group_size} is part of the family SD_(2^n), with n = {n}.\")\n    print(\"Its structure is defined by generators 'r' and 's'.\")\n    \n    # Step 2: Determine the exponent of the group.\n    # The exponent is the LCM of the orders of all elements.\n    # The order of 'r' is 2^(n-1), and other elements have orders 2 or 4.\n    exponent = 2**(n - 1)\n    \n    print(f\"\\nThe exponent of the group is the LCM of all element orders, which is {exponent}.\")\n\n    # Step 3: Find the number of divisors of the exponent.\n    # For an exponent of the form 2^k, the number of divisors is k+1.\n    k = n - 1\n    num_divisors = k + 1\n\n    print(f\"The number of power subgroups is the number of distinct subgroups G^d,\")\n    print(f\"where 'd' is a divisor of the exponent ({exponent}).\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nThe analysis shows that each divisor of the exponent yields a distinct power subgroup:\")\n    print(f\"  - d=1: G^1 = SD_{group_size}, Order = {group_size}\")\n    for i in range(1, k + 1):\n        d = 2**i\n        order = exponent // d\n        if i == 1:\n            print(f\"  - d={d}: G^{d} = <r^{d}>, a cyclic subgroup of order {order}\")\n        elif i > 1 and d <= exponent:\n            print(f\"  - d={d}: G^{d} = <r^{d}>, a cyclic subgroup of order {order}\")\n            \n    # Step 4: Final calculation and output.\n    print(\"\\nSince all these subgroups are distinct, the total count is the number of divisors of the exponent.\")\n    print(\"\\n--- FINAL EQUATION ---\")\n    print(f\"Number of power subgroups = Number of divisors of exponent({exponent}) = {num_divisors}\")\n\nsolve_semidihedral_power_subgroups()\n<<<9>>>\n```"
