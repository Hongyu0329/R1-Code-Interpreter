# This script models the cellular response to two electrophilic compounds.
# The core logic is based on the Keap1-Nrf2 pathway.
# 1. Base level of ALDH is set.
# 2. Relative potency for each compound is assigned based on scientific literature.
#    - 4-OI is a more potent Nrf2 activator than HNY.
# 3. A simple linear formula calculates the increase in ALDH.
#    - Formula: New Level = Base Level + (Base Level * (Potency * Concentration) / Normalization_Factor)
#    - This demonstrates that a higher potency leads to a greater increase.

# --- Parameters ---
concentration = 50  # uM, as given in the problem
base_aldh_level = 100.0 # Using a baseline of 100 for easy percentage-like comparison.

# Assigning relative potency scores based on scientific knowledge
# 4-OI is a stronger Nrf2 activator than HNY.
