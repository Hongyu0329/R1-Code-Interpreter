    "Of course. To determine the scaling exponent α for the specific heat in a system with spatial dimension d=3 using the epsilon expansion, we can follow these steps:\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify Key Parameters**: In the context of the Renormalization Group and ε-expansion, the upper critical dimension for many common models (like the Ising, XY, and Heisenberg models) is `d_c = 4`. The problem specifies the spatial dimension `d = 3`.\n2.  **Calculate Epsilon (ϵ)**: The expansion parameter `ϵ` is defined as the deviation from the upper critical dimension: `ϵ = d_c - d`.\n3.  **State the Epsilon Expansion Formula**: The formula for the specific heat exponent `α` to the first order in `ϵ` is given by:\n    `α = (4 - n) * ϵ / (2 * (n + 8))`\n    Here, `n` represents the number of components of the order parameter. Since the specific model (universality class) is not mentioned, we will use the simplest and most common case, the Ising model, where `n = 1`.\n4.  **Substitute and Calculate**: We will substitute the values of `n`, `d`, and `d_c` into the formulas to calculate `ϵ` and then `α`.\n5.  **Generate Python Code**: A Python script will be created to perform these calculations and print the steps and the final result clearly.\n\nNow, here is the Python code to execute this plan.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef calculate_alpha_exponent():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the specific heat exponent alpha using the epsilon expansion.\n\n    In renormalization group theory, the epsilon expansion is a technique to\n    calculate critical exponents as a power series in the parameter epsilon.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Step 1: Define the parameters\n    d_c = 4  # Upper critical dimension for the n-vector model\n    d = 3    # Spatial dimension as given in the problem\n    n = 1    # Number of components of the order parameter for the Ising model\n\n    # Step 2: Calculate epsilon\n    epsilon = d_c - d\n    \n    # Step 3: Calculate the alpha exponent using the first-order formula\n    # alpha = (4 - n) * epsilon / (2 * (n + 8))\n    # We will use SymPy to represent the result as an exact fraction.\n    numerator = (4 - n) * epsilon\n    denominator = 2 * (n + 8)\n    \n    alpha = sympy.Rational(numerator, denominator)\n\n    # Step 4: Print the results and the calculation steps\n    print(\"Calculation of the Specific Heat Exponent (α) via Epsilon Expansion\")\n    print(\"-\" * 65)\n    print(f\"Upper critical dimension, d_c = {d_c}\")\n    print(f\"Spatial dimension, d = {d}\")\n    print(f\"Order parameter components (Ising model), n = {n}\\n\")\n    \n    print(\"The expansion parameter, epsilon (ε), is calculated as:\")\n    print(f\"ε = d_c - d = {d_c} - {d} = {epsilon}\\n\")\n    \n    print(\"The first-order epsilon expansion formula for α is:\")\n    print(\"α = (4 - n) * ε / (2 * (n + 8))\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Substituting the values into the formula:\")\n    final_equation = f\"α = (4 - {n}) * {epsilon} / (2 * ({n} + {8}))\"\n    calculation_steps = f\" = {4-n} / (2 * {n+8}) = {numerator} / {denominator}\"\n    final_result = f\" = {alpha}\"\n    \n    print(final_equation + calculation_steps + final_result)\n\ncalculate_alpha_exponent()\n```\n<<<1/6>>>"
