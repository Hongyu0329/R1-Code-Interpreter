    "To find the leading order expression for the fixed point coupling `u*` in the `ϕ⁴` theory near four dimensions, we will follow the standard procedure of the renormalization group (RG) analysis.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Introduce the Beta Function**: The core of the RG analysis is the beta function, `β(u)`, which describes how the dimensionless coupling `u` of the theory changes with the energy scale.\n2.  **State the One-Loop Beta Function**: For `ϕ⁴` theory in `d = 4 - ϵ` dimensions, the beta function is calculated using perturbation theory. We will use the standard one-loop result.\n3.  **Apply the Fixed Point Condition**: A fixed point, `u*`, represents a scale-invariant point in the theory's parameter space. This is where the beta function is zero, i.e., `β(u*) = 0`.\n4.  **Solve for u***: We will solve the equation `β(u*) = 0` to find the expression for the non-trivial fixed point (known as the Wilson-Fisher fixed point) in terms of `ϵ`.\n\nThe following Python script will carry out this plan and print the derivation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_fixed_point_coupling():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the derivation of the leading order expression for the\n    Wilson-Fisher fixed point coupling u* in phi^4 theory near d=4 dimensions.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"Derivation of the Wilson-Fisher Fixed Point Coupling u*\")\n    print(\"======================================================\")\n\n    # Step 1: Explain the beta function\n    print(\"\\nStep 1: The Beta Function β(u)\")\n    print(\"In the renormalization group analysis of ϕ⁴ theory in d = 4 - ϵ dimensions,\")\n    print(\"the beta function describes the running of the dimensionless coupling constant 'u'.\")\n    print(\"To one-loop order, the beta function is:\")\n    print(\"\\n  β(u) = -ϵ*u + (3 / (16 * π²)) * u²\\n\")\n    print(\"The first term, -ϵ*u, arises from the classical scaling of the coupling.\")\n    print(\"The second term, proportional to u², is the one-loop quantum correction.\")\n\n    # Step 2: Explain the fixed point condition\n    print(\"\\nStep 2: The Fixed Point Condition\")\n    print(\"A fixed point u* is a value of the coupling where the theory becomes scale-invariant.\")\n    print(\"This occurs when the coupling stops 'running', which means the beta function is zero:\")\n    print(\"\\n  β(u*) = 0\\n\")\n\n    # Step 3: Solve the equation\n    print(\"\\nStep 3: Solving for u*\")\n    print(\"We set the beta function expression to zero to find u*:\")\n    print(\"  -ϵ*u* + (3 / (16 * π²)) * (u*)² = 0\")\n    print(\"\\nFactoring out u*, we get:\")\n    print(\"  u* * [ -ϵ + (3 / (16 * π²)) * u* ] = 0\")\n    print(\"\\nThis equation has two solutions:\")\n    print(\"1. u* = 0 (the trivial Gaussian fixed point)\")\n    print(\"2. -ϵ + (3 / (16 * π²)) * u* = 0 (the non-trivial Wilson-Fisher fixed point)\")\n    print(\"\\nSolving the second equation for u*:\")\n    print(\"  (3 / (16 * π²)) * u* = ϵ\")\n    print(\"\\nRearranging the terms gives the final expression for the Wilson-Fisher fixed point.\")\n    \n    # Final Answer Section\n    numerator = 16\n    denominator = 3\n    \n    print(\"\\n-----------------------------------------------------------\")\n    print(\"The leading order expression for the fixed point coupling is:\")\n    print(f\"\\n  u* = ({numerator} * π² / {denominator}) * ϵ\\n\")\n    print(\"-----------------------------------------------------------\")\n\n# Run the function to display the derivation\nsolve_fixed_point_coupling()\n```\n<<<(16 * pi**2 / 3) * epsilon>>>"
