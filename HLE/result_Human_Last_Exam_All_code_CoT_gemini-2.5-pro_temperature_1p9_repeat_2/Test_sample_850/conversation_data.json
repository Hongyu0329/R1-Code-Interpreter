    "The question you're asking contains a contradiction based on the definitions of the terms in crystallography. Let's break it down:\n\n*   **Optical Activity:** This is the ability of a material to rotate the plane of polarized light. A fundamental requirement for a crystal to be optically active is that it must be **chiral**.\n*   **Chiral Crystal:** A crystal is chiral if its structure cannot be superimposed on its mirror image. In terms of symmetry, this means its point group (crystal class) **must not contain a center of inversion or a mirror plane**. There are 11 chiral crystal classes.\n*   **Achiral Crystal:** This is the opposite of chiral. An achiral crystal's structure *is* superimposable on its mirror image. This means its point group **must contain a center of inversion or a mirror plane**.\n\nTherefore, a crystal class cannot be both **achiral** and **optically active** at the same time. The two conditions are mutually exclusive. Optical activity is a definitive property of chiral structures.\n\nThe following Python code clarifies this principle by defining the different categories of crystal classes and explaining why no crystal class can meet your criteria.\n\n```python\ndef find_contradictory_crystal_classes():\n    \"\"\"\n    Explains the relationship between chirality, achirality, and optical activity in crystal classes.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The 11 chiral crystal classes.
