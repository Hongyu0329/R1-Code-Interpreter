# Based on the symbolic derivation, the value of the integral is 2**(15/16).
# The code below calculates this value.

# The final equation for the answer is base**(numerator/denominator)
base = 2
numerator = 15
denominator = 16

# Calculate the result
value = base**(numerator/denominator)

# As requested, printing the numbers in the final equation and the result
print(f"The integral evaluates to an equation with the following numbers: base={base}, numerator={numerator}, denominator={denominator}.")
print(f"The final equation is: {base}**({numerator}/{denominator})")
print(f"The calculated value of the definite integral is: {value}")
