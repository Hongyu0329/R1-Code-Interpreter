    Analyzes the properties of a class of graphs C with bounded degree and unbounded treewidth.

    The properties of class C are:
    1. Maximum degree is at most d (a constant).
    2. Treewidth is unbounded.

    Let's analyze the options:
    A. For each k, there is a graph in C containing an induced cycle of length k.
       This is false. A grid graph is a counterexample, as it has bounded degree and unbounded treewidth but no odd induced cycles.

    B. For each k, there is a graph in C containing the k-by-k-grid as a subgraph.
       This is false. It is a major open problem in graph theory. A subdivided grid is a counterexample.

    C. C is a family of expander graphs.
       This is false. The class of grid graphs is a counterexample.

    D. For each k, there is a graph in C containing an induced matching of size k.
       This is true. Unbounded treewidth implies an unbounded number of vertices (|V|). For a graph with |V| vertices and max degree d, a greedy algorithm can find an induced matching of size at least |V| / (2d). Since |V| is unbounded and d is constant, the induced matching size is unbounded. This conclusion uses both premises.

    E. The graphs in C contain clique-minors of unbounded size.
       This is true. A cornerstone of graph theory (the Grid Minor Theorem) states that having unbounded treewidth is equivalent to having unbounded grid minors. Having an unbounded grid minor, in turn, implies having an unbounded clique minor. This conclusion follows from the unbounded treewidth premise alone.

    Comparing D and E: Both are provably true. However, E is a more fundamental consequence and is essentially equivalent to the definition of unbounded treewidth in structural graph theory. Unbounded treewidth implies unbounded clique minors (E), and unbounded treewidth combined with bounded degree implies an unbounded induced matching (D). Therefore, E is the more direct and fundamental property. In the hierarchy of graph properties, E is a direct characterization of unbounded treewidth, from which D can be derived given the extra condition of bounded degree. Thus, E is the best answer.
