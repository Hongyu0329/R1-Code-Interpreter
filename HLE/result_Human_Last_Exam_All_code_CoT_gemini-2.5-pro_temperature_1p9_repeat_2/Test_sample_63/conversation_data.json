    "My plan is to solve this riddle by breaking down the clues and finding the person who fits all of them.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Clues:**\n    *   The person is described as looking \"like a porcupine\". This suggests someone with famously wild, spiky hair.\n    *   The description is attributed to Kurt Vonnegut.\n    *   The person's name is two words, and both words begin with the same letter.\n\n2.  **Evaluate Candidates:**\n    *   The Vonnegut quote is often linked to the writer Ambrose Bierce, whose photos show him with unruly hair. However, his name (\"Ambrose Bierce\") does not fit the same-letter rule (A & B).\n    *   Another common association with \"porcupine hair\" is Albert Einstein, but his name also fails the letter rule (A & E).\n    *   Considering both the visual description and the name pattern leads to the German playwright and poet **Bertolt Brecht**. His photos show him with iconic spiky hair, and his name perfectly matches the \"two words, same letter\" rule (B & B). While the direct Vonnegut quote might be a slight misattribution or a conflation of facts, Bertolt Brecht is the only figure who strongly fits all parts of the riddle.\n\n3.  **Code Implementation:**\n    I will write a simple Python script to store the first and last names in variables and then print the full name to the console.\n\n```python\n# The person described as looking like a porcupine with a name\n# where both words start with the same letter is the German\n# playwright and poet, Bertolt Brecht.\n\nfirst_name = \"Bertolt\"\nlast_name = \"Brecht\"\n\n# Print the full name as the answer\nprint(first_name + \" \" + last_name)\n```\n<<<Bertolt Brecht>>>"
