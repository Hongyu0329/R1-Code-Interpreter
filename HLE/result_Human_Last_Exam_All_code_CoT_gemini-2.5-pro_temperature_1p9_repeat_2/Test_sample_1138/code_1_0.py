    # Step 1: Analyze the Premise
    print("\n[Step 1: Premise Analysis]")
    print("The question introduces an 'existentially forgeable' digital signature scheme, citing ECDSA as an example.")
    print("This is a confusing premise, as ECDSA is designed to be 'existentially *un*forgeable'. A scheme is secure if forgery is computationally infeasible (has negligible probability), and insecure ('forgeable') if forgery has a non-negligible probability.")
    print("We will evaluate each statement based on the standard security goals and properties of ECDSA.")

    # Step 2: Evaluate Option A
    print("\n[Step 2: Option A Analysis]")
    print("Statement A: 'For ECDSA: Given m, sig, pk, a computationally bounded adversary can create a new, different signature sig' that is verifiable given pk with no more than negligible probability.'")
    print("Analysis: This states that it's computationally hard to find a *second* signature for a given message. This is a crucial security property of a robust signature scheme like ECDSA. If an attacker could do this, the scheme's unforgeability would be compromised. Thus, this statement correctly describes a security goal of ECDSA.")
    print("Verdict: Statement A is TRUE.")

    # Step 3: Evaluate Option B
    print("\n[Step 3: Option B Analysis]")
    print("Statement B: 'For ECDSA: Given m, sig, pk, a computationally bounded adversary can recover the secret key sk with no more than negligible probability.'")
    print("Analysis: This states that it's computationally hard to find the private key. This is the most fundamental security requirement of any public-key cryptosystem. If an attacker could recover the secret key, they could forge signatures for any message. The security of ECDSA against this is based on the presumed hardness of the Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem (ECDLP).")
    print("Verdict: Statement B is TRUE.")

    # Step 4: Evaluate Option C
    print("\n[Step 4: Option C Analysis]")
    print("Statement C: 'For some existentially forgeable digital signature schemes: Only given m, pk, a computationally bounded adversary can generate sig' that (sig', m) is verifiable against pk with non-negligible probability.'")
    print("Analysis: This statement is about the existence of certain types of insecure schemes. It is not about ECDSA directly. It asks if schemes vulnerable to selective forgery (where an attacker can sign a pre-determined message) exist. Yes, such insecure or 'broken' schemes exist in cryptographic literature. Any scheme vulnerable to selective forgery is, by definition, also existentially forgeable.")
    print("Verdict: Statement C is TRUE.")
    
    # Step 5: Evaluate Option D
    print("\n[Step 5: Option D Analysis]")
    print("Statement D: 'For all existentially forgeable digital signature schemes: Only given sig, pk, a computationally bounded adversary can figure out m with no more than negligible probability.'")
    print("Analysis: This claims that recovering the message from the signature is hard for *all* forgeable schemes. Signature schemes are primarily for authenticity, not confidentiality. While many modern schemes effectively hide the message by signing its hash, it is not a required property. It is easy to construct a 'forgeable' scheme that does not hide the message. The claim 'for all' is too strong.")
    print("Verdict: Statement D is FALSE.")

    # Step 6: Conclusion
    print("\n[Step 6: Conclusion]")
    print("We have established that statements A, B, and C are all true.")
    print(" - A and B are true statements about the security goals of ECDSA.")
    print(" - C is a true statement regarding the existence of a specific class of insecure schemes.")
    print("Since more than one statement from A-D is true, the correct option is E.")
