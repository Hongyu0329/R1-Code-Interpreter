    "To determine the total number of contracted Gaussian functions for toluene (C7H8) with a 6-31G basis set, we need to calculate the number of functions for each atom and then sum them up.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the atoms in the molecule:** Toluene is C7H8, so it has 7 Carbon atoms and 8 Hydrogen atoms.\n2.  **Determine basis functions per Carbon (C) atom with 6-31G:**\n    *   Carbon is a second-row element.\n    *   The core 1s orbital is represented by 1 contracted function (from the '6' in 6-31G).\n    *   The valence 2s and 2p orbitals are \"split-valence\" (from the '31' in 6-31G). This means each valence atomic orbital is represented by two basis functions.\n    *   Valence orbitals for C are 2s, 2px, 2py, and 2pz (a total of 4 orbitals).\n    *   Number of valence basis functions = 4 orbitals * 2 basis functions/orbital = 8 functions.\n    *   Total functions for one Carbon atom = 1 (core) + 8 (valence) = 9 contracted functions.\n3.  **Determine basis functions per Hydrogen (H) atom with 6-31G:**\n    *   Hydrogen only has a 1s valence orbital and no core orbitals.\n    *   The 1s orbital is split into two basis functions (from the '31' in 6-31G).\n    *   Total functions for one Hydrogen atom = 2 contracted functions.\n4.  **Calculate the total for the molecule:**\n    *   Total = (Number of C atoms × Functions per C) + (Number of H atoms × Functions per H)\n    *   Total = (7 × 9) + (8 × 2)\n5.  **Implement in Python:** A Python script will be created to perform this calculation and print the final equation and result.\n\n```python\n# Toluene molecule composition\nnum_carbon = 7\nnum_hydrogen = 8\n\n# Number of contracted Gaussian functions for each atom type with a 6-31G basis set\n# For Carbon (C): 1s(core) + 2s(valence) + 2p(valence) -> 1 + 2 + (2*3) = 9 functions\n# For Hydrogen (H): 1s(valence) -> 2 functions\nfuncs_per_carbon = 9\nfuncs_per_hydrogen = 2\n\n# Calculate the total number of functions from Carbon atoms\ntotal_carbon_funcs = num_carbon * funcs_per_carbon\n\n# Calculate the total number of functions from Hydrogen atoms\ntotal_hydrogen_funcs = num_hydrogen * funcs_per_hydrogen\n\n# Calculate the total for the molecule\ntotal_funcs = total_carbon_funcs + total_hydrogen_funcs\n\n# Print the breakdown of the calculation\nprint(f\"For toluene (C{num_carbon}H{num_hydrogen}) with a 6-31G basis set:\")\nprint(f\"Number of basis functions per Carbon atom = {funcs_per_carbon}\")\nprint(f\"Number of basis functions per Hydrogen atom = {funcs_per_hydrogen}\")\nprint(\"\\nCalculating the total number of contracted Gaussian functions:\")\nprint(f\"Total Functions = ({num_carbon} C atoms * {funcs_per_carbon} funcs/C) + ({num_hydrogen} H atoms * {funcs_per_hydrogen} funcs/H)\")\nprint(f\"Total Functions = ({num_carbon} * {funcs_per_carbon}) + ({num_hydrogen} * {funcs_per_hydrogen})\")\nprint(f\"Total Functions = {total_carbon_funcs} + {total_hydrogen_funcs}\")\nprint(f\"Total Functions = {total_funcs}\")\n\n```\n<<<79>>>"
