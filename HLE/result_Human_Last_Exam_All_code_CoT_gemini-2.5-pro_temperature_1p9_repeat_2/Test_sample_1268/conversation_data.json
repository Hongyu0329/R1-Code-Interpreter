    "This problem requires connecting concepts from number theory, specifically the study of Bianchi groups, which are groups of the form $PSL_2(\\mathcal{O}_N)$ for the ring of integers $\\mathcal{O}_N$ of an imaginary quadratic field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-N})$ with $N$ being a squarefree natural number.\n\nMy interpretation of your question is as follows:\n1.  The term $(k_{k,\\infty})$ is a non-standard notation. A plausible interpretation is that it represents the **height of the principal cusp**, often denoted $h_\\infty$, for the Bianchi group corresponding to the field $k = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-N})$. This height is a geometric measure of the fundamental domain of the group and can be considered a \"maximum\" value among the heights of all cusps.\n2.  The covolume $(V)$ is the volume of the quotient space $\\mathbb{H}^3 / PSL_2(\\mathcal{O}_N)$.\n3.  The task is to find the mathematical relationship that acts as an upper bound between these two quantities.\n\nI will provide a Python script that states this relationship. The script does not compute a value for a specific $N$, but rather programmatically prints the general formula that holds for any squarefree natural number $N$. The formula is derived from standard results in number theory.\n\n### The Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify Key Formulas:** I will use the established formulas for the principal cusp height ($h_\\infty$) and the covolume ($V$) of a Bianchi group.\n    *   $h_\\infty = \\frac{\\sqrt{|D_N|}}{2w_N}$\n    *   $V = \\frac{|D_N|^{3/2}}{4\\pi^2} \\zeta_{\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-N})}(2)$\n2.  **Relate the Quantities:** I will algebraically manipulate these two formulas to express $h_\\infty$ in terms of $V$. This involves eliminating the discriminant $D_N$.\n3.  **Construct Python Code:** The Python code will print the resulting formula in a clear and readable format. It will also provide explanations for each term in the formula, fulfilling the requirement to \"output each number in the final equation\".\n\nHere is the Python script to be executed:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef display_upper_bound_formula():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script presents the formula for the upper bound of the maximum cusp height\n    in relation to the covolume for Bianchi groups.\n\n    The script assumes the user's notation (k_k,inf) refers to the height\n    of the principal cusp (h_inf) for the Bianchi group associated with the\n    squarefree integer N.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Formula Derivation Explanation ---\n    # The height of the principal cusp (h_inf) is given by:\n    # h_inf = sqrt(|D_N|) / (2 * w_N)\n    #\n    # The covolume (V) is given by:\n    # V = |D_N|^(3/2) * zeta_k(2) / (4 * pi^2)\n    #\n    # where zeta_k(2) = zeta(2) * L(2, chi_D_N) = (pi^2 / 6) * L(2, chi_D_N).\n    #\n    # By expressing |D_N| in terms of V from the second formula and substituting\n    # into the first, we arrive at the relationship.\n    # From the volume formula: |D_N| = ( (4 * pi^2 * V) / zeta_k(2) )^(2/3)\n    # Substituting zeta_k(2): |D_N| = ( (24 * V) / L(2, chi_D_N) )^(2/3)\n    #\n    # Then h_inf = (1 / (2*w_N)) * sqrt(|D_N|)\n    # h_inf = (1 / (2*w_N)) * ( (24 * V) / L(2, chi_D_N) )^(1/3)\n\n    print(\"Based on the interpretation of (k_k,inf) as the maximal cusp height (h_inf),\")\n    print(\"the relationship with the covolume (V) for a squarefree integer N is:\")\n    print(\"\\n\" + \"=\"*80)\n\n    # --- Printing the Final Formula ---\n    term1_num = 24\n    term2_num = 1\n    term2_den = 3\n    term3_num = 2\n\n    print(f\"\\n              (    {term1_num} * V    )^({term2_num}/{term2_den})\")\n    print( \"k_k,inf  <=   ----------------------------\")\n    print(f\"            ( {term3_num} * w_N * [L(2, chi_D_N)]^({term2_num}/{term2_den}) )\")\n\n    print(\"\\n\" + \"=\"*80)\n\n    # --- Explanation of Terms ---\n    print(\"\\nWhere the terms are defined as follows:\")\n    print(\"  V: The covolume of the Bianchi group PSL_2(O_N).\")\n    print(\"  N: A squarefree natural number defining the imaginary quadratic field k = Q(sqrt(-N)).\")\n    print(\"  D_N: The discriminant of the field k.
