    "The task is to find the dimension of the Lie group of symmetries of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in 3-dimensional Euclidean space ($\\mathbb{R}^3$). A symmetry of a differential equation is a continuous transformation of its independent and dependent variables that maps any solution to another solution. These symmetries form a Lie group, and its dimension is a key characteristic.\n\nMy plan to determine this dimension is as follows:\n1.  I will identify the fundamental physical symmetries that the equations respect. These transformations are well-established in the study of fluid dynamics and differential equations.\n2.  For each type of symmetry transformation (time translation, spatial translations, rotations, Galilean boosts, and scaling), I will state the number of independent parameters, which corresponds to the dimension of that symmetry subgroup.\n3.  The total dimension of the maximal finite-dimensional symmetry group is the sum of these individual dimensions. It's worth noting that the Navier-Stokes equations also have an infinite-dimensional symmetry group related to the pressure term, but the question conventionally refers to the finite-dimensional part.\n4.  I will provide a Python script that carries out this summation and prints the final calculation, showing how each symmetry component contributes to the total dimension, as requested.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_lie_group_dimension():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates and explains the dimension of the Lie group of\n    symmetries for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in R^3.\n\n    The dimension is found by summing the dimensions of the independent\n    symmetry transformations that leave the equations invariant.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
