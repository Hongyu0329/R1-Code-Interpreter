    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the dimension of the bosonic part of the target manifold for the supersymmetric sigma-model corresponding to symmetry class D with two replicas.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the Target Manifold:** For symmetry class D with `N` replicas, the target space is a symmetric superspace given by the coset `OSp(2N|2N) / (OSp(N|N) x OSp(N|N))`. The question asks for the number of non-Grassman (bosonic) variables, which corresponds to the dimension of the bosonic part of this superspace.\n2.  **Identify the Bosonic Subspace:** The bosonic part of the target manifold is the coset space `G_B / H_B`, where:\n    *   `G_B` is the bosonic part of `OSp(2N|2N)`, which is `O(2N) x Sp(2N, R)`.\n    *   `H_B` is the bosonic part of `OSp(N|N) x OSp(N|N)`, which is `(O(N) x Sp(N, R)) x (O(N) x Sp(N, R))`.\n3.  **Calculate the Dimension:** The number of variables is the dimension of this coset space, which is calculated as `dim(G_B) - dim(H_B)`. We will use the following standard formulas for the dimensions of the Lie groups:\n    *   Dimension of the orthogonal group `O(p)`: `p * (p - 1) / 2`\n    *   Dimension of the real symplectic group `Sp(2n, R)`: `n * (2n + 1)`\n4.  **Implement in Python:** Write a Python script that performs this calculation for `N=2` replicas and prints out each step of the calculation, including the dimensions of the individual groups, the total dimensions `dim(G_B)` and `dim(H_B)`, and the final subtraction.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef dim_orthogonal(p):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the dimension of the orthogonal group O(p).\"\"\"\n    return p * (p - 1) // 2\n\ndef dim_symplectic_real(p):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the dimension of the real symplectic group Sp(p,R).\n    p must be an even integer.
