    Calculates the dimension of a log blowup using toric geometry methods.

    The problem asks for the dimension of the log blowup of P in I, where:
    - P is a point with log structure N^3. This corresponds to the affine space A^3,
      whose associated toric fan has a single 3-dimensional cone sigma.
    - The cone sigma is generated by the standard basis vectors e1, e2, e3.
    - I is the log ideal generated by (1,0,0) and (0,1,0), corresponding to e1 and e2.

    The log blowup corresponds to a subdivision of the cone sigma.
