        ("Disease Context", "In Myotonic Dystrophy (DM), disease severity is linked to the expansion of a CTG repeat sequence. This expansion, occurring over time in somatic cells, is termed 'somatic instability'."),
        ("LIG1 Function", "LIG1 (DNA Ligase I) is a crucial enzyme that repairs nicks in DNA, particularly during the replication of the lagging DNA strand. This is a process where the repetitive CTG sequence is thought to be vulnerable to errors."),
        ("Mechanism of Instability", "Scientific models suggest that the expansion of the CTG repeat is an active process that occurs during DNA replication/repair, promoted by a specific set of proteins, including LIG1."),
        ("Impact of LIG1 Knockout", "When LIG1 is removed (knocked out) or reduced, this expansion-promoting machinery is disrupted. Experimental evidence from mouse and cell models shows that LIG1 deficiency suppresses the rate and degree of CTG repeat expansions."),
        ("Overall Effect", "While the absence of LIG1 can sometimes lead to contractions of the repeat, the primary effect on the disease-relevant instability is a strong reduction in harmful expansions. Therefore, the overall somatic instability is considered reduced."),
        ("Conclusion", "Based on the evidence, knocking out LIG1 reduces CTG somatic instability by preventing the pathological expansions characteristic of Myotonic Dystrophy.")
