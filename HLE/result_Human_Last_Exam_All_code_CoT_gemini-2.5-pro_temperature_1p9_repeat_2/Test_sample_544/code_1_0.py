# The reaction is a Pummerer rearrangement.
# 1. The sulfoxide (methyl phenyl sulfoxide) is activated by triflic anhydride.
# 2. A proton is lost from the alpha-carbon (the methyl group) to form a thionium ion intermediate [Ph-S+=CH2].
# 3. The cyanide nucleophile (from TMSCN) attacks the thionium ion.
# 4. The final product is Ph-S-CH2-CN.

# Now, we determine the IUPAC name for Ph-S-CH2-CN.
# The principal functional group is nitrile (-CN).
# The parent chain is acetonitrile.
# A phenylthio group (Ph-S-) is a substituent at position 2.
# Therefore, the name is 2-(phenylthio)acetonitrile.
