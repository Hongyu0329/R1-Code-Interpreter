    High temperature exposure in cyanobacteria like Microcystis aeruginosa disrupts normal cellular processes, leading to the rapid formation of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS). The cell's first and most immediate line of defense against this oxidative burst is the enzymatic antioxidant system.

    1.  **Initial ROS Formation:** The primary ROS formed under stress is the superoxide radical (O₂⁻).

    2.  **Enzymatic Response:** The enzyme Superoxide Dismutase (SOD) specifically and very rapidly catalyzes the dismutation of superoxide radicals into oxygen (O₂) and hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂). Subsequently, enzymes like Catalase (CAT) or peroxidases neutralize the hydrogen peroxide.

    3.  **Speed and Efficiency:** This enzymatic response is extremely fast and catalytic, making it the ideal initial defense mechanism to prevent widespread damage.

    4.  **Other Systems:** While non-enzymatic antioxidants (both liposoluble like carotenoids and hydrosoluble like glutathione) are also vital, they typically act in concert with or subsequent to the initial enzymatic wave of detoxification.
