    1.  The poem describes moths that are now just "eyes and dust" inside "oval frames". They have been "caught behind silvered dislocation". This phrase poetically describes the reflective glass of the frame, which acts as a trap.

    2.  The poem states that this trap is equivalent to "that strange tarnished logic of their discipline."

    3.  Breaking down the phrase:
        *   "Their discipline": The pronoun "their" refers to the moths. A moth's "discipline" is its instinct—its rigid, ordered pattern of behavior.
        *   "Logic": The specific instinct at play is phototaxis, the attraction to light or reflections. This is the moth's biological "logic": If light, then fly towards it.
        *   "Strange": This logic is "strange" because a survival instinct becomes self-destructive when tricked by an artificial object like glass.
        *   "Tarnished": This word evokes the decay on old silver ("silvered"). It means the moth's logic has been corrupted or spoiled, leading to a tarnished outcome: death and dust.

    4.  Conclusion: The phrase describes how the moths' own instinct—their biological logic—is flawed in the face of human artifacts and becomes a self-destructive, corrupted force. This directly matches option E.
