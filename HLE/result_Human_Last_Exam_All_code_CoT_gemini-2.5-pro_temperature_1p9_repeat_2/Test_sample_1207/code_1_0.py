    1.  **Analyze the Clinical Triad:** The patient presents with a classic triad of symptoms:
        *   **Neurologic:** Pulsatile headaches, suggestive of encephalopathy.
        *   **Ophthalmologic:** Transient monocular vision loss, suggesting branch retinal artery occlusions (BRAO).
        *   **Auditory:** Hearing loss, suggesting cochlear involvement.

    2.  **Identify the Likely Syndrome:** This triad is the hallmark of Susac's Syndrome, a rare autoimmune endotheliopathy that affects the microvasculature of the brain, retina, and inner ear.

    3.  **Match with Imaging Findings:** The characteristic and often pathognomonic findings for Susac's Syndrome on a brain MRI are:
        *   Central corpus callosum lesions that are hyperintense on T2/FLAIR sequences, famously described as "snowball" lesions.
        *   Leptomeningeal enhancement can also be present due to inflammation.

    4.  **Evaluate Answer Choices:**
        *   (A) Fits rheumatoid arthritis, but not the primary triad.
        *   (B) Perfectly describes the classic MRI findings in Susac's Syndrome.
        *   (C) Is a non-specific finding and does not explain the neurological/ocular/auditory symptoms.
        *   (D) The lesions are microinfarcts, not typically hemorrhage.
        *   (E) A pituitary mass would cause different visual field defects and not the other symptoms.

    Conclusion: The patient's presentation strongly points to Susac's Syndrome, making the corresponding MRI findings the expected result.
