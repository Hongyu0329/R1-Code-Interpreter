    "This is a biological question about the neuroanatomy of the dwarf cuttlefish. My plan is to identify the relevant brain structures based on established cephalopod brain atlases and neurobiological research. The dwarf cuttlefish shares its basic brain structure with other well-studied cuttlefish species, so I can use that information to determine which lobes are situated posterior to the palliovisceral lobe.\n\nTo meet the user's request for a code-based solution, I will provide the answer within a Python script that prints the information clearly.\n\n```python\ndef find_adjacent_brain_regions():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the brain regions adjacent posteriorly\n    to the palliovisceral lobe in a cuttlefish.\n    \n    The brain anatomy of cephalopods is complex. The palliovisceral lobe is\n    part of the posterior subesophageal mass, a region controlling the mantle,\n    funnel, and internal organs.\n    \n    Based on scientific brain atlases for Sepia (cuttlefish), the brain regions\n    located immediately posterior to the palliovisceral lobe are the\n    posterior basal lobe and the median basal lobe.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    target_lobe = \"palliovisceral lobe\"\n    adjacent_posterior_regions = [\n        \"posterior basal lobe\",\n        \"median basal lobe\"\n    ]\n\n    print(f\"The brain regions that lie adjacent posteriorly to the {target_lobe} are:\")\n    for region in adjacent_posterior_regions:\n        print(f\"- {region}\")\n\n# Execute the function to provide the answer.\nfind_adjacent_brain_regions()\n```\n<<<The brain regions that lie adjacent posteriorly to the palliovisceral lobe are the posterior basal lobe and the median basal lobe.>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Which brain regions lie adjacent posteriorly to the palliovisceral lobe in the dwarf cuttlefish?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
