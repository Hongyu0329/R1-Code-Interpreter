    "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori in a reductive group $G$ of type $E_8$.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Recall the relevant theorem:** A key result by R. Steinberg states that for any connected reductive algebraic group $G$ defined over a finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$, the total number of maximal tori of $G$ that are rational over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is given by the formula $q^N$.\n2.  **Identify N:** In this formula, $N$ represents the number of positive roots in the root system associated with the group $G$. For a group of type $E_8$, we use the $E_8$ root system.\n3.  **Calculate N for E8:** The number of positive roots ($N$) is half the total number of roots. The total number of roots can be calculated from the dimension and the rank of the simple Lie algebra of the same type.\n    *   The dimension of the Lie algebra of type $E_8$ is 248.\n    *   The rank of the Lie algebra of type $E_8$ is 8.\n    *   Total number of roots = Dimension - Rank.\n    *   Number of positive roots (N) = (Total number of roots) / 2.\n4.  **Final Calculation:** Substitute the calculated value of $N$ back into the formula $q^N$ to get the final answer.\n\nI will now provide a Python script that carries out these calculations and prints each step clearly.\n\n```python\ndef solve_tori_count():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of Fq-rational maximal tori for a reductive group\n    of type E8 over a finite field Fq with q elements.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Group properties for type E8\n    group_type = \"E8\"\n    dimension = 248\n    rank = 8\n\n    print(f\"Finding the number of rational maximal tori for a group of type {group_type} over the finite field Fq.\")\n    print(\"The number is given by the formula q^N, where N is the number of positive roots.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    # Step 1: Calculate the total number of roots\n    print(\"Step 1: Calculate the total number of roots for the E8 root system.\")\n    print(f\"The dimension of the Lie algebra of type {group_type} is {dimension}.\")\n    print(f\"The rank of the Lie algebra of type {group_type} is {rank}.\")\n    total_roots = dimension - rank\n    print(f\"The total number of roots = Dimension - Rank = {dimension} - {rank} = {total_roots}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    # Step 2: Calculate the number of positive roots (N)\n    print(\"Step 2: Calculate the number of positive roots, N.\")\n    positive_roots = total_roots // 2\n    print(f\"The number of positive roots (N) is half the total number of roots.\")\n    print(f\"N = Total Roots / 2 = {total_roots} / 2 = {positive_roots}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    # Step 3: State the final answer\n    print(\"Step 3: State the final formula for the number of tori.\")\n    print(f\"The number of Fq-rational maximal tori is q^N.\")\n    print(f\"Substituting N = {positive_roots}, we get the final answer.\")\n    print(f\"\\nFinal Answer Equation: Number of Tori = q^{positive_roots}\")\n\nsolve_tori_count()\n\n```\n<<<q^120>>>"
