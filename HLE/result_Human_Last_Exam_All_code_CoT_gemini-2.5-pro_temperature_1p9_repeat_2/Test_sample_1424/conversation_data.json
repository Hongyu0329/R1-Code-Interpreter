    "In the Feynman path integral formalism, the Green's function (or propagator) describes the probability amplitude for a particle to travel between two spacetime points. For a *non-interacting* system, this is called the **bare Green's function**, denoted as $G_0$.\n\nThe functional dependence of $G_0$ on the single-particle energy eigenvalues $\\epsilon_k$ is most clearly seen in the frequency-momentum representation. The derivation from the path integral involves a Fourier transform from imaginary time to Matsubara frequencies, which can then be analytically continued to real frequencies.\n\nThe final result for the retarded bare Green's function at zero temperature is:\n\n$G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\eta}$\n\nHere is a breakdown of the terms and the dependence:\n*   $G_0(k, \\omega)$: The bare Green's function for a particle with momentum $k$ and frequency (energy) $\\omega$.\n*   $\\epsilon_k$: The single-particle energy eigenvalue. This is the energy of a particle with momentum $k$ when it is not interacting with any other particles.\n*   $\\omega$: The frequency variable. You can think of this as the energy you are using to \"probe\" the system.\n*   $i\\eta$: A small imaginary part, where $\\eta$ is a positive infinitesimal ($ \\eta \\to 0^+ $). It is a mathematical convenience that ensures causality (effects cannot precede their causes) and gives the particle a finite lifetime.\n\nThe functional dependence is an **inverse relationship**. The Green's function has a **simple pole** when the probing energy $\\omega$ is exactly equal to the particle's intrinsic energy $\\epsilon_k$. This pole signifies the existence of a stable, well-defined particle with energy $\\epsilon_k$.\n\nThe following Python script will define example values for these variables and print out the equation to demonstrate this relationship explicitly.\n\n```python\nimport cmath\n\n# In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function G_0\n# for a non-interacting particle with energy eigenvalue epsilon_k\n# is expressed in the frequency-momentum domain.\n\n# --- Parameters ---\n# Let's choose some example values for the variables.\n# The units would typically be electron-volts (eV) in solid-state physics.\n\n# The energy of the single-particle state (e.g., for a specific momentum k)\nepsilon_k = 1.5\n\n# The frequency (probing energy) at which we evaluate the Green's function\nomega = 1.4\n\n# A small positive infinitesimal value for the imaginary part\neta = 0.1\n\n# --- Functional Dependence ---\n# The dependence of the bare Green's function G_0 on the energy\n# eigenvalue epsilon_k is given by the following formula for the\n# retarded Green's function:\n#\n# G_0(k, omega) = 1 / (omega - epsilon_k + i*eta)\n\nprint(\"The functional form of the bare Green's function G_0 is:\")\nprint(\"  G_0(k, ω) = 1 / (ω - ε_k + iη)\")\nprint(\"-\" * 40)\nprint(\"Substituting the example numerical values:\")\nprint(f\"  Probing Frequency (ω) = {omega}\")\nprint(f\"  Single-particle Energy (ε_k) = {epsilon_k}\")\nprint(f\"  Infinitesimal (η) = {eta}\")\nprint(\"-\" * 40)\n\n# We construct the final equation string using the values.\n# This clearly shows each number in its place within the equation.\nprint(\"The final equation is:\")\nprint(f\"  G_0 = 1 / ({omega} - {epsilon_k} + i*{eta})\")\n\n# Let's also compute the numerical result for completeness.\ndenominator = (omega - epsilon_k) + 1j * eta\ng0_value = 1 / denominator\n\nprint(\"\\nCalculating the result:\")\nprint(f\"  G_0 = 1 / ({denominator.real} + {denominator.imag}i)\")\nprint(f\"  G_0 ≈ {g0_value.real:.2f} {g0_value.imag:+.2f}i\")\n\n```\n<<<$G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\eta}$>>>"
