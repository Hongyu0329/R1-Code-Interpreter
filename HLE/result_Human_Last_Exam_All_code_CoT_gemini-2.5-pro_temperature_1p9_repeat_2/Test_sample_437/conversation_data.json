    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a plan for solving the problem:\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the Expression:** The expression $\\langle \\phi_i | \\frac{1}{r} | \\phi_j\\rangle$ represents a quantum mechanical integral. For a single 1s Slater orbital, this means $i=j$, and we are calculating the expectation value of the potential energy operator $1/r$ for an electron in that orbital. This is a one-center integral.\n2.  **Analytical Derivation:**\n    *   The normalized 1s Slater-type orbital (STO) is given by $\\phi_{1s}(r) = \\left( \\frac{\\zeta^3}{\\pi} \\right)^{1/2} e^{-\\zeta r}$, where $\\zeta$ (zeta) is the orbital exponent.\n    *   The integral to evaluate is $I = \\int \\phi_{1s}^* \\left(\\frac{1}{r}\\right) \\phi_{1s} dV$.\n    *   We will solve this integral in spherical coordinates, where the volume element is $dV = r^2 \\sin\\theta \\, dr \\, d\\theta \\, d\\varphi$.\n    *   The integral becomes $I = \\frac{\\zeta^3}{\\pi} \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\int_0^\\pi \\int_0^\\infty e^{-2\\zeta r} \\frac{1}{r} r^2 \\sin\\theta \\, dr \\, d\\theta \\, d\\varphi$.\n    *   We can separate this into angular and radial parts:\n        *   **Angular part:** $\\int_0^{2\\pi} d\\varphi \\int_0^\\pi \\sin\\theta d\\theta = (2\\pi)(2) = 4\\pi$.\n        *   **Radial part:** $\\int_0^\\infty r e^{-2\\zeta r} dr$. This can be solved using standard integrals and gives the result $\\frac{1}{(2\\zeta)^2} = \\frac{1}{4\\zeta^2}$.\n    *   **Final Result:** Combining all parts, $I = \\left(\\frac{\\zeta^3}{\\pi}\\right) \\times (4\\pi) \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{4\\zeta^2}\\right) = \\zeta$.\n    The analytical result is simply the orbital exponent, $\\zeta$.\n3.  **Python Code for Numerical Verification:**\n    *   I will write a Python script to verify this analytical result by performing numerical integration.\n    *   The script will break down the calculation into its components (Normalization Constant, Angular Integral, Radial Integral) as derived above.\n    *   It will use `scipy.integrate.quad` for high-precision numerical integration of the radial part.\n    *   Finally, it will assemble the parts and print the result, showing how each number contributes to the final equation, and compare it with the expected analytical value.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the evaluation.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.integrate import quad\n\ndef evaluate_integral(zeta):\n    \"\"\"\n    Evaluates the integral <phi_1s| 1/r |phi_1s> for a given zeta.\n\n    The integral is broken down into three parts based on the analytical derivation:\n    Result = (Normalization Constant)^2 * (Angular Integral) * (Radial Integral)\n\n    Args:\n        zeta (float): The orbital exponent of the 1s Slater orbital.\n    \n    Returns:\n        float: The numerically calculated value of the integral.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # 1.
