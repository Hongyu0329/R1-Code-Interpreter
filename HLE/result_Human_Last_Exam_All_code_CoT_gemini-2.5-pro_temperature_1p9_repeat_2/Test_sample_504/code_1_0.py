# The plan to find the largest number of vectors is to decompose the space
# and use known maximal sets of vectors in the subspaces.
# Let N(d) be the maximum number of vectors in C^d satisfying the conditions.
# Let M(d) be the maximum number of equiangular lines in C^d with angle pi/3.
# The total number of vectors can be found by combining sets from orthogonal subspaces.
# A robust strategy is to decompose C^6 into C^4 and C^2.
# So, N(6) >= N(4) + M(2).

# Step 1: Determine N(4), the maximum number of vectors in C^4.
# A set of vectors in C^4 satisfying the conditions (angles pi/2 or pi/3, with at least one orthogonal pair)
# can be constructed from Mutually Unbiased Bases (MUBs).
# In C^4, there are d+1 = 5 MUBs. Each basis contains d=4 vectors.
# The union of these 5 bases forms a set of 5 * 4 = 20 vectors.
# The angle between any two vectors from the same basis is pi/2 (orthogonal).
# The angle between any two vectors from different bases is arccos(1/sqrt(4)) = arccos(1/2) = pi/3.
# This set of 20 vectors meets all the requirements. It is widely believed to be the maximum.
n_4 = 20

# Step 2: Determine M(2), the maximum number of equiangular lines in C^2.
# For angle arccos(1/2), the maximum number of equiangular lines in C^2 is 3.
# This is a known result from the theory of complex equiangular lines.
m_2 = 3

# Step 3: Combine the results to get a lower bound for N(6).
# We place the N(4) vectors in a C^4 subspace and M(2) vectors in its orthogonal complement C^2.
# Let S1 be the set of N(4) vectors in C^4 and S2 be the set of M(2) vectors in C^2.
# The union S = S1 U S2 is a set in C^6.
# - Any two vectors from S1 have the correct angle property.
# - Any two vectors from S2 have the correct angle property.
# - Any vector from S1 is orthogonal to any vector from S2 (angle pi/2).
# The set S has orthogonal pairs (e.g., within S1, and any pair from S1 and S2).
# So the total number is the sum of the sizes of the two sets.
total_vectors = n_4 + m_2
