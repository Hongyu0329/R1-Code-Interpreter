    "The names of the prophets in Islam are mentioned over several verses in the poem 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam'. My plan is to identify the starting verse number and the ending verse number where this list of names is located. Then, I will write a simple Python script to store these numbers and print the answer in a clear sentence, fulfilling the request to use code and output the specific numbers.\n\n```python\ndef find_prophet_verses():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies and prints the range of verses (bayt) in 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam'\n    that list the names of the Prophets.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The verse where the list of prophets' names begins.\n    start_bayt = 29\n\n    # The verse where the list of prophets' names ends.\n    end_bayt = 32\n\n    print(\"In the poem 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam' by Sayyid Ahmad al-Marzuqi, the names of the Prophets are mentioned from:\")\n    print(f\"Bayt number: {start_bayt}\")\n    print(\"to\")\n    print(f\"Bayt number: {end_bayt}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    find_prophet_verses()\n```\n<<<29 to 32>>>"
