    "When porting the Prisoner's Dilemma to a quantum environment, the players' strategies and the initial state of the game can be designed to overcome the classical dilemma. In the classical version, the Nash Equilibrium is for both players to defect, leading to a suboptimal payoff of (1, 1). In the quantum version, we can achieve a Pareto-optimal outcome where the dilemma is resolved.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Quantum Game Setup:** We model the game using the Eisert-Wilkens-Lewenstein (EWL) scheme. The game starts with two qubits, one for each player, prepared in an entangled initial state.\n2.  **Design the Initial State:** The problem allows us to design the initial state for an optimal outcome. We will use an entangling operator `J` that links the players' qubits. A specific choice of `J` can dramatically change the game's dynamics. We will choose `J = exp(i * π/4 * σ_y ⊗ σ_y)`, which creates a maximally entangled state.\n3.  **Define Player Strategies:** The classical strategies \"Cooperate\" (C) and \"Defect\" (D) are represented by quantum operators. We will use the standard representations: `C` is the Identity operator `I`, and `D` is the quantum equivalent `iσ_x` (where `σ_x` is the Pauli-X matrix).\n4.  **Calculate the Outcome:** The players apply their chosen strategy operators (`U_A` and `U_B`) to the initial state. The final state is then measured after being passed through a disentangling operator `J†`.\n5.  **Find the Equilibrium Payoff:** We will calculate the payoff for the strategy pair `(D, D)`. In this specifically designed quantum game, we'll see that players choosing their classical \"Defect\" strategy paradoxically leads to the \"Cooperate-Cooperate\" outcome, yielding the highest possible mutual payoff of (5, 5). This becomes a new Nash Equilibrium, effectively resolving the dilemma.\n\nThe Python code below will use the `sympy` library to perform the quantum calculations symbolically and demonstrate this result. It will construct the operators and states, compute the final state for the `(D,D)` strategy profile, and calculate the resulting payoff based on the provided matrix.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\nfrom sympy.physics.quantum import TensorProduct, Dagger\n\ndef solve_quantum_prisoners_dilemma():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the equilibrium point for a quantum Prisoner's Dilemma\n    by designing an optimal initial entangled state.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Payoff matrix values\n    # (Cooperate, Cooperate)\n    R = 5\n    # (Cooperate, Defect) - Sucker (A), Temptation (B)\n    S_A = 0\n    T_B = 7\n    # (Defect, Cooperate) - Temptation (A), Sucker (B)\n    T_A = 7\n    S_B = 0\n    # (Defect, Defect)\n    P = 1\n\n    # Define necessary quantum operators using sympy\n    I = sympy.eye(2)\n    sx = sympy.Matrix([[0, 1], [1, 0]])\n    sy = sympy.Matrix([[0, -1j], [1j, 0]])\n\n    # Define player strategies: C (Cooperate) and D (Defect)\n    C = I\n    D = 1j * sx\n\n    # 1.
