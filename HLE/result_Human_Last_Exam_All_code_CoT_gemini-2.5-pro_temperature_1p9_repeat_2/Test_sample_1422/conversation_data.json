    "To solve this problem, we need to use the topological relations for Feynman diagrams. I will assume the most common type of interacting scalar field theory, the $\\phi^4$ theory, where each interaction vertex connects four lines.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the relevant formulas:** There are two key equations that relate the number of loops (L), vertices (V), internal lines (I), and external lines (E) in a Feynman diagram.\n    *   The first formula is a general topological relation for any connected graph: `L = I - V + 1`\n    *   The second formula depends on the type of interaction. For a $\\phi^4$ theory, each vertex has four lines attached. These lines can be either internal or external. Counting all line ends gives us: `4 * V = 2 * I + E`\n\n2.  **Set up the system of equations:** We are given that the diagram has two loops, so `L = 2`. We want to find the minimum possible value for `V`.\n\n3.  **Solve for V:** I will write a Python script to manipulate these two equations to express the number of vertices `V` in terms of the number of external lines `E`.\n\n4.  **Find the minimum:** The number of vertices `V` will depend on `E`. To minimize `V`, we must find the minimum possible value for `E`. In a scalar field theory, the simplest diagrams are vacuum bubbles, which have no external lines (`E=0`).\n\n5.  **Calculate the final answer:** The script will substitute `E=0` into the derived equation to calculate the minimum number of vertices and print the final equation with all numbers.\n\n```python\ndef solve_feynman_vertices():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the minimum number of vertices in a two-loop Feynman diagram\n    for an interacting scalar phi^4 theory.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # We start with two fundamental formulas for Feynman diagrams:\n    # 1.
