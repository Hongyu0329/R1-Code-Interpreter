    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my analysis of the conditions and a Python script to demonstrate finding a tripled fixed point.\n\n### Plan and Analysis\n\nFirst, let's clarify the problem. You are asking for the conditions under which three functions, `F`, `G`, and `H`, have a \"tripled fixed point.\" Based on your function signatures, and assuming a typo in your prompt (the second `G` should likely be `H`), we have:\n\n*   `F: X × Y × Z → X`\n*   `G: Y × X × Y → Y`\n*   `H: Z × Y × X → Z`\n\nAn **FGH-tripled fixed point** is a triplet of points `(x, y, z)` where `x` is in set `X`, `y` is in `Y`, and `z` is in `Z`, that simultaneously satisfies the following system of equations:\n1.  `x = F(x, y, z)`\n2.  `y = G(y, x, y)`\n3.  `z = H(z, y, x)`\n\nThe primary conditions for the existence and uniqueness of such a point come from a generalization of the **Banach Fixed-Point Theorem**. In essence, the conditions are:\n1.  **Metric Space:** The sets `X`, `Y`, and `Z` must be complete metric spaces (which means they have a consistent notion of \"distance,\" and sequences that look like they should converge actually do). The real numbers (`R`) are a common example.\n2.  **Contraction Mapping:** The system of functions `(F, G, H)` must collectively act as a **contraction mapping** on the combined space `X × Y × Z`. This means that when you apply the functions to any two different input triplets, the resulting output triplets are closer to each other than the original inputs were. This \"shrinking\" property guarantees that if we start with any guess and repeatedly apply the functions, we will converge to a single, unique fixed point.\n\nI will now provide a Python script that defines a set of functions `F`, `G`, and `H` that satisfy the contraction condition on the set of real numbers. The script will then use an iterative method to find the numerical value of the tripled fixed point `(x, y, z)` and verify that it satisfies the three equations, printing each number involved.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef F(x, y, z, c1=5, k=0.2, l=0.1, m=0.3):\n    \"\"\"Defines the function F: R x R x R -> R\"\"\"\n    return c1 + k * x + l * y + m * z\n\ndef G(y, x, y2, c2=6, k=0.2, l=0.1):\n    \"\"\"\n    Defines the function G: R x R x R -> R.\n    As per the signature G:Y*X*Y->Y, there are two y inputs.\n    In a linear model, this is y_new = c2 + k*y + l*x. The second y is ignored.\n    \"\"\"\n    return c2 + k * y + l * x\n\ndef H(z, y, x, c3=7, k=0.2, l=0.1, m=0.1):\n    \"\"\"Defines the function H: R x R x R -> R\"\"\"\n    return c3 + k * z + l * y + m * x\n\ndef find_tripled_fixed_point():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the FGH-tripled fixed point using an iterative method.\n    The coefficients are chosen to ensure the mapping is a contraction.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Initial guess\n    x, y, z = 0.0, 0.0, 0.0\n    \n    # Number of iterations for convergence\n    iterations = 100\n    \n    # Iteratively apply the functions\n    for _ in range(iterations):\n        x_new = F(x, y, z)\n        y_new = G(y, x, y) # The third argument is the same y\n        z_new = H(z, y, x)\n        \n        # Update the points\n        x, y, z = x_new, y_new, z_new\n        \n    return x, y, z\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function to find the fixed point and print the verification.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Finding the FGH-tripled fixed point for a sample system...\")\n\n    # Define the constants for our example system\n    c1, f_k, f_l, f_m = 5, 0.2, 0.1, 0.3\n    c2, g_k, g_l = 6, 0.2, 0.1\n    c3, h_k, h_l, h_m = 7, 0.2, 0.1, 0.1\n\n    # Find the fixed point\n    x_fp, y_fp, z_fp = find_tripled_fixed_point()\n    \n    print(f\"\\nFound the tripled fixed point (x, y, z) after 100 iterations:\")\n    print(f\"x = {x_fp:.4f}\")\n    print(f\"y = {y_fp:.4f}\")\n    print(f\"z = {z_fp:.4f}\")\n    \n    print(\"\\n---------------------------------------------------------\")\n    print(\"Verifying the fixed point conditions: x=F(x,y,z), y=G(y,x,y), z=H(z,y,x)\")\n    print(\"---------------------------------------------------------\")\n    \n    # 1.

This means the functions \"shrink\" the distance between any two points, guaranteeing that an iterative process will converge to a single unique solution.>>>"
