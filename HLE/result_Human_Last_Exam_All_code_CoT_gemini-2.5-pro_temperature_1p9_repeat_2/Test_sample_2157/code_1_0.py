    Solves the problem based on a structured set of assumptions.
    
    1. The problem of minimizing Tr(D_n) * (Det(D_n))^(1/n) points towards n_0=1.
       This is based on the assumption that the symmetric part of M_n leads to a
       monotonically increasing function f(n), with the simplest such case being S_n = I.
       This fixes the matrix size to N=3.
       
    2. With n_0=1, M_1 is a 3x3 sparse upper Hessenberg matrix. A plausible canonical
       choice compatible with the previous step's reasoning (while needing a waiver on
       the eigenvalue location for other n) and leading to a parameter-free result is
       M_1 = [[1, 1, 0], [-1, 1, 1], [0, -1, 1]].

    3. We then follow the remaining instructions algorithmically.
