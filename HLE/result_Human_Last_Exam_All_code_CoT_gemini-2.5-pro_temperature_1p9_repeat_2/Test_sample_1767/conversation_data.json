    "In this problem, we are asked to determine the Chern number of a combined system, which is formed by joining two Chern insulators side-by-side.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the key physical principle:** The Chern number is a topological invariant. For a system composed of non-interacting or weakly interacting subsystems, the Chern number of the total system is the sum of the Chern numbers of the individual subsystems. This is known as the additivity of the Chern number.\n2.  **Define the given values:** We have two Chern insulators.\n    *   Chern insulator 1 has a Chern number, C₁ = 1.\n    *   Chern insulator 2 has a Chern number, C₂ = 1.\n3.  **Calculate the total Chern number:** The Chern number of the junction, C_total, will be the sum of the individual Chern numbers: C_total = C₁ + C₂.\n4.  **Write a Python script:** The script will define the variables for C₁ and C₂, calculate their sum, and then print the entire equation, including the initial numbers, the operation, and the final result.\n\nThis principle can be understood by considering the edge states. Each C=1 insulator contributes one chiral edge state. At the interface between the two insulators, these two edge states propagate in opposite directions and will typically gap out, leaving the interface insulating. However, along the outer boundary of the combined system, the edge states from both insulators co-propagate, resulting in a total of two chiral edge modes. According to the bulk-boundary correspondence, a system with two chiral edge modes must have a bulk Chern number of 2.\n\n```python\n# Define the Chern numbers of the two individual insulators.\nC1 = 1\nC2 = 1\n\n# The Chern number of a combined system is the sum of the Chern numbers\n# of its constituent parts. This is a fundamental property of topological invariants.\nC_total = C1 + C2\n\n# Print the explanation and the calculation.\nprint(\"The Chern number of a system formed by joining two subsystems is the sum of their individual Chern numbers.\")\nprint(\"Given two Chern insulators with Chern numbers C1 and C2:\")\nprint(f\"C1 = {C1}\")\nprint(f\"C2 = {C2}\")\nprint(\"The Chern number of the junction (the total system) is C_total = C1 + C2.\")\nprint(f\"Therefore, the calculation is:\")\nprint(f\"C_total = {C1} + {C2} = {C_total}\")\n```\n<<<2>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response.
