    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the integral:\n\n### Plan\n1.  **Simplify the Integrand**: The expression inside the integral, $f(x) = (\\csc x)(\\mathrm{arccsc}\\sqrt{1+\\csc^2 x})$, looks complex. I will simplify it using trigonometric identities. The key identity is that for $x \\in (0, \\pi)$, the term $\\mathrm{arccsc}\\sqrt{1+\\csc^2 x}$ can be shown to be equivalent to $\\arctan(\\sin x)$.\n    - Let $\\theta = \\mathrm{arccsc}(\\sqrt{1+\\csc^2 x})$. Then $\\csc \\theta = \\sqrt{1+\\csc^2 x}$.\n    - Squaring both sides gives $\\csc^2 \\theta = 1+\\csc^2 x$.\n    - Using the identity $\\csc^2 \\theta = 1 + \\cot^2 \\theta$, we get $1+\\cot^2 \\theta = 1+\\csc^2 x$, which simplifies to $\\cot^2 \\theta = \\csc^2 x$.\n    - Taking the square root, we have $\\cot \\theta = |\\csc x|$. Since the integral is from $0$ to $\\pi$, $\\sin x > 0$ and thus $\\csc x > 0$. So, $\\cot \\theta = \\csc x$.\n    - This means $\\theta = \\mathrm{arccot}(\\csc x)$.\n    - Using the identity $\\mathrm{arccot}(y) = \\arctan(1/y)$, we have $\\theta = \\arctan(1/\\csc x) = \\arctan(\\sin x)$.\n2.  **Rewrite the Integral**: With the simplification, the integral becomes $I = \\int_0^{\\pi} \\csc(x) \\arctan(\\sin x) dx$, which can be written as $I = \\int_0^{\\pi} \\frac{\\arctan(\\sin x)}{\\sin x} dx$.\n3.  **Solve the Integral**: This new form of the integral is a classic and can be solved using techniques like Feynman's trick (differentiation under the integral sign). However, for this task, I will use Python's symbolic mathematics library, `SymPy`, to compute the exact value.\n4.  **Present the Final Answer**: The code will calculate the value and then print the final equation `I = value` and extract and print all the numbers present in the final expression as requested.\n\nHere is the Python code to execute this plan.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\nfrom sympy import Symbol, integrate, csc, acsc, sqrt, pi, log, atan, pretty\n\ndef solve_integral():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the definite integral I = ∫[0,π] csc(x) * arccsc(sqrt(1 + csc(x)^2)) dx.\n    It first simplifies the integrand and then computes the integral's value using SymPy.\n    \"\"\"\n    x = Symbol('x')\n    \n    # Define the original integrand\n    original_integrand = csc(x) * acsc(sqrt(1 + csc(x)**2))\n    \n    print(\"The integral to solve is:\")\n    # Using pretty print for a nicer display of the integral expression\n    pretty_integral = pretty(integrate(original_integrand, (x, 0, pi)), use_unicode=True)\n    print(pretty_integral)\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Simplify the integrand.
