    print("Black's defense is centered around the Knight on b6 (controlling a8) and the active King on f5.")

    print("Evaluating Candidate Moves:\n")

    print("Choice A: a8=Q")
    print("Analysis: After 1. a8=Q, Black must play 1...Nxa8. White exchanges the powerful passed pawn for the knight. In the resulting endgame, Black's active king and pawn structure give them excellent drawing chances, and White may even be worse. This move squanders the winning advantage.\n")

    print("Choice B: Nc5")
    print("Analysis: This is an outstanding positional move. It attacks the e6 pawn and, more importantly, severely restricts Black's knight. If the knight moves off the b-file (e.g., to d7), White plays a8=Q and wins. This move puts Black in zugzwang (a situation where any move worsens their position) without giving up any advantage or allowing counterplay. It is a clean, systematic path to victory.\n")
    
    print("Choice C: Kd4")
    print("Analysis: This is another strong move. It improves the position of White's king, preparing it to support the knight and control key squares. While it is also winning, it may allow Black more counterplay than Nc5. For instance, after 1. Kd4 g3, the position can become sharp.\n")

    print("Choice D: Kf2")
    print("Analysis: This move is too passive. The king moves away from the key central area, allowing Black's king to become more dominant. It does not help White's plan.\n")
    
    print("Choice E: Nf4")
    print("Analysis: This is a tactical solution. The idea is that after 1...Kxf4, White plays 2. a8=Q. While this results in a winning Queen vs. Knight endgame for White, it is not the most efficient path. It gives Black's king a very active post on f4 and allows immediate counterplay with 2...g3+. The conversion is much more difficult than with other moves.\n")
    
    print("Choice F: b4")
    print("Analysis: This move is not helpful. It creates a potential weakness on b4 for White's pawn structure and doesn't pose any significant problems for Black.\n")

    print("-" * 50)
    print("Conclusion:")
    print("While several moves are winning for White, Nc5 is the most precise. It improves White's position, creates threats, and suffocates Black's defenses without allowing counterplay. It demonstrates the principle of not rushing to 'cash in' an advantage when a positional squeeze is more effective.")
    print("\nThe best move is B. Nc5.")
