    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of ordinary double points (nodes) in the stable reduction of the given curve modulo 2.\n\n**1. Identify the type of curve and its genus.**\n\nThe curve is given by the equation $y^2 = 8x^5 + 4x^4 + 4x^3 + x^2 + 8x$.\nThis is a hyperelliptic curve of the form $y^2 = f(x)$. The genus of such a curve is determined by the degree of the polynomial $f(x)$, which we'll call $d$.\n\nThe degree of $f(x)$ is $d=5$.\n\nFor a hyperelliptic curve defined by $y^2 = f(x)$, the genus $g$ is calculated using the formula $g = \\lfloor \\frac{d-1}{2} \\rfloor$.\nIn our case, $d=5$, so the genus is:\n$g = \\frac{5-1}{2} = 2$.\n\n**2. Understand the Stable Reduction.**\n\nThe stable reduction of a curve over a prime (in this case, $p=2$) is a \"simpler\" curve that shares the same fundamental properties, like its arithmetic genus. The stable reduction may consist of one or more components, and its only singularities are ordinary double points (nodes), where two branches of the curve cross transversally.\n\nThe arithmetic genus of the original curve is conserved in the stable reduction. Let $C_{red}$ be the stable reduction. The arithmetic genus of $C_{red}$ must be equal to the genus of the original curve, which is 2.\n\n**3. Determine the structure of the Stable Reduction.**\n\nLet's assume the stable reduction is a single irreducible curve. The arithmetic genus of an irreducible curve is given by the formula $p_a = p_g + \\delta$, where $p_g$ is the geometric genus (the genus of its smooth model or normalization) and $\\delta$ is the number of double points.\n\nFor many curves over number fields, the stable reduction is a rational curve (a curve of geometric genus $p_g=0$). If we assume this is the case for our curve, its stable reduction is an irreducible rational curve.\n\nFor such a curve, we have:\n$p_a(C_{red}) = p_g(C_{red}) + \\delta = 0 + \\delta = \\delta$.\n\n**4. Calculate the number of double points.**\n\nSince the arithmetic genus must be conserved, we have:\n$g = p_a(C_{red})$\n$2 = \\delta$\n\nThis implies that the stable reduction has 2 double points. This is a common scenario for a genus 2 curve to reduce to a rational curve with two nodes.\n\nThe calculation is as follows:\n- The degree of the polynomial $f(x)$ is $d=5$.\n- The genus of the curve is $g = (d-1)/2 = (5-1)/2 = 2$.\n- The number of double points in the stable reduction is equal to the genus, which is 2.\n\n```python\n# The equation of the curve is y^2 = f(x), where\n# f(x) = 8*x**5 + 4*x**4 + 4*x**3 + 1*x**2 + 8*x\n#\n# Step 1: Find the genus of the curve.\n# The degree 'd' of the polynomial f(x) is 5.\nd = 5\n\n# The genus 'g' of a hyperelliptic curve y^2 = f(x) is given by g = floor((d-1)/2).\n# Since d=5 is odd, g = (d-1)/2.\ng = (d - 1) / 2\n\n# Step 2: Relate the genus to the stable reduction.\n# The arithmetic genus of a curve is preserved under stable reduction.\n# Let's assume the stable reduction of this curve is a single irreducible rational curve.\n# A rational curve has geometric genus 0.\n# The arithmetic genus of an irreducible curve is the sum of its geometric genus\n# and its number of double points (delta).\n# p_a_reduced = p_g_reduced + delta\n#\n# Step 3: Calculate the number of double points.\n# By equating the genus of the original curve with the arithmetic genus of its stable reduction:\n# g = p_a_reduced = 0 + delta\n# Thus, delta = g.\nnum_double_points = g\n\n# The final equation determines the number of double points based on the degree of the polynomial.\nprint(\"The number of double points is found by first calculating the genus of the curve.\")\nprint(\"The calculation for the number of double points is:\")\nprint(f\"{int(num_double_points)} = ({d} - 1) / 2\")\n\n```\n<<<2>>>"
