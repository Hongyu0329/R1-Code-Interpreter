    "To solve this problem, we will use a known theorem from knot theory that relates the HOMFLY polynomial of a knot to its minimum number of Seifert circles.\n\n**My Plan:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Key Formula:** The minimum number of Seifert circles of a knot K, denoted $s(K)$, is bounded below by its HOMFLY polynomial, $P(K; a, z)$, according to the inequality:\n    $s(K) \\geq \\text{span}_a(P) + 1$\n    Here, $\\text{span}_a(P)$ is the breadth of the polynomial in the variable 'a', calculated as the difference between the highest and lowest powers of 'a' appearing in the polynomial.\n\n2.  **Obtain the HOMFLY Polynomial:** I will use the Python library `spherogram` to programmatically find the HOMFLY polynomial for the knot $9_{23}$. This library is specifically designed for calculations in knot theory.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Polynomial:** The polynomial will be returned as a `sympy` symbolic expression. I will use `sympy`'s functions to identify the highest and lowest degree terms with respect to the variable 'a'.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Bound:** I will subtract the lowest degree from the highest degree to get the span. Then, I will add 1 to the span to find the lower bound for the number of Seifert circles.\n\n5.  **Present the Result:** The script will print out the computed polynomial, the values used in the calculation (highest degree, lowest degree, span), and the final equation for the lower bound, making the process clear and transparent.\n\n```python\n# The user needs to have the 'spherogram' library installed.\n# It can be installed using pip: pip install spherogram\nimport spherogram as sp\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_knot_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates a lower bound for the minimum number of Seifert circles\n    of the 9_23 knot using its HOMFLY polynomial.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        # Define the knot by its Rolfsen notation\n        knot_name = '9_23'\n        knot = sp.Knot(knot_name)\n\n        # Define the variables for the HOMFLY polynomial\n        a, z = sympy.symbols('a, z')\n\n        # Calculate the HOMFLY polynomial P(a, z)\n        homfly_poly = knot.homfly_polynomial(variables=(a, z))\n        \n        # Expand the polynomial to ensure all terms are distinct\n        homfly_poly_expanded = sympy.expand(homfly_poly)\n        \n        print(f\"For the knot {knot_name}, the HOMFLY polynomial P(a, z) is:\")\n        print(homfly_poly_expanded)\n        print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n        # To find the span of 'a', we need the highest and lowest powers of 'a'.\n        # We can treat the expression as a polynomial in 'a'.\n        poly_in_a = sympy.Poly(homfly_poly_expanded, a)\n        \n        # Get all degrees of 'a' present in the polynomial\n        degrees = poly_in_a.degrees()[0] # .degrees() for multivariable Poly\n        \n        max_degree_a = max(degrees)\n        min_degree_a = min(degrees)\n        \n        # Calculate the span of 'a'\n        span_a = max_degree_a - min_degree_a\n        \n        # The lower bound for the number of Seifert circles is span_a + 1\n        lower_bound = span_a + 1\n        \n        print(\"A lower bound for the minimum number of Seifert circles is given by span_a(P) + 1.\")\n        print(f\"The highest power of 'a' is: {max_degree_a}\")\n        print(f\"The lowest power of 'a' is: {min_degree_a}\")\n        print(f\"The span of 'a' is: max_degree - min_degree = {max_degree_a} - ({min_degree_a}) = {span_a}\")\n        print(\"\\nThe final equation for the lower bound is:\")\n        print(f\"Lower bound = {span_a} + 1 = {lower_bound}\")\n\n    except ImportError:\n        print(\"The 'spherogram' library is required.
