    "To answer your question, I will first identify the person whose lectures Albert Einstein cited in his 1905 paper on Brownian motion. Then, I will write a Python script to print out this information. The prompt also asks to include numbers from a final equation, so I will also include the main equation for the diffusion coefficient from that same paper and print the numerical constants from it.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  Store the name of the cited scientist in a variable.\n2.  Print a sentence stating that this scientist's lectures were cited by Einstein.\n3.  Display the formula for the diffusion coefficient as presented in Einstein's paper.\n4.  Explicitly print the numerical constants found in that formula to satisfy the prompt's requirement.\n\n```python\ndef solve_einstein_citation():\n    # Step 1: Identify the scientist whose lectures were cited.\n    # In his 1905 paper \"Über die von der molekularkinetischen Theorie der Wärme geforderte Bewegung\n    # von in ruhenden Flüssigkeiten suspendierten Teilchen\", Einstein's work on Brownian motion\n    # was heavily based on the principles of statistical mechanics, pioneered by Ludwig Boltzmann.\n    # Einstein's work can be seen as a direct application and validation of Boltzmann's statistical theories.\n    cited_lecturer = \"Ludwig Boltzmann\"\n\n    # Step 2: Print the answer to the user's question.\n    print(f\"In his 1905 paper on Brownian motion, Albert Einstein's work was fundamentally based on the principles from the lectures and theories of: {cited_lecturer}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # Step 3: Display the key equation from the paper.\n    # One of the paper's core results is the formula for the diffusion coefficient (D).\n    # This equation provided a theoretical way to calculate Avogadro's number (N_A) by observing Brownian motion.\n    print(\"A key equation from the paper is the formula for the diffusion coefficient (D):\")\n    print(\"D = (R * T) / (N_A * 6 * \\u03c0 * \\u03b7 * a)\")\n    print(\"Where:\")\n    print(\"  R = Gas constant\")\n    print(\"  T = Absolute temperature\")\n    print(\"  N_A = Avogadro's number\")\n    print(\"  \\u03b7 = Viscosity of the fluid\")\n    print(\"  a = Radius of the particle\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n    \n    # Step 4: Output the numbers from the final equation as requested.\n    number_in_equation = 6\n    print(\"The numerical constant explicitly mentioned in the denominator of this equation is:\")\n    print(number_in_equation)\n\nsolve_einstein_citation()\n```\n<<<Ludwig Boltzmann>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Whose lectures did Albert Einstein cite in his 1905 paper on Brownian motion?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
