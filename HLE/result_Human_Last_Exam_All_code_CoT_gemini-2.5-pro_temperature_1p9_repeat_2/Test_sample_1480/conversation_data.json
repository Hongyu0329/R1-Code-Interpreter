    "To calculate the rule activation level of an interval type-3 fuzzy set, we need to apply a t-norm operation to the firing level of the rule's antecedent, `Phi_k(x′)`, and the membership grade of the consequent, `μG_k_j(y_j)`. The most common t-norm used for this purpose is the minimum (min) operation.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  Assign the given values to variables: `phi = 0.7` and `mu = 0.9`.\n2.  Calculate the t-norm of these two values. We will use the `min` function: `activation_level = min(phi, mu)`.\n3.  Print the equation showing the values used and the final result.\n\n```python\n# Given values\nphi = 0.7\nmu = 0.9\n\n# The rule activation level is calculated using a t-norm,\n# typically the minimum operator.\nactivation_level = min(phi, mu)\n\n# Print the equation and the result\nprint(f\"Rule Activation Level = t-norm(Phi_k(x'), μG_k_j(y_j))\")\nprint(f\"Rule Activation Level = min({phi}, {mu})\")\nprint(f\"Rule Activation Level = {activation_level}\")\n\n```\n<<<0.7>>>"
