In summary: No, the local magnetic field at the L1 point is generally not radial due to the Parker spiral nature of the interplanetary magnetic field. Therefore, for an accurate calculation of properties of field-aligned waves like AIC waves, you must transform the magnetic field data into a Field-Aligned Coordinate (FAC) system and use the components perpendicular to the local mean magnetic field, rather than using components perpendicular to the radial direction.
