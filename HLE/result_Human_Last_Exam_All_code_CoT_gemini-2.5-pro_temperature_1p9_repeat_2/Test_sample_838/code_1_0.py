Here is the detailed analysis of each reaction step:

Step 1: Elimination Reaction (Formation of Product A)
*   Starting Material: [(3S)-3-bromobutyl]benzene. Its structure is a butane chain with a phenyl group at position 1 and a bromine atom at position 3, with (S) stereochemistry at C3.
*   Reagent: Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK) is a strong, sterically hindered base.
*   Reaction Details: This reaction is an E2 elimination. Due to the large size of the t-BuOK base, it preferentially abstracts a proton from the least sterically hindered adjacent carbon. In this case, it removes a proton from the terminal methyl group (C4) rather than the internal methylene group (C2). This is known as Hofmann elimination.
*   Product A: The major product is 4-phenylbut-1-ene. During this elimination reaction, the double bond is formed and the chiral center at C3 is destroyed. Therefore, Product A is achiral.

Step 2: Hydroboration-Oxidation (Formation of Product B)
*   Starting Material: 4-phenylbut-1-ene (Product A).
*   Reagents: The reaction is a two-step process: 1. Borane in THF (BH3/THF), followed by 2. Oxidation with hydrogen peroxide and sodium hydroxide (H2O2/NaOH).
*   Reaction Details: This is a hydroboration-oxidation reaction that adds H and OH across the double bond. The reaction exhibits anti-Markovnikov regioselectivity, meaning the hydroxyl (-OH) group adds to the less-substituted carbon of the double bond (C1).
*   Product B: The resulting product is 4-phenylbutan-1-ol. This molecule is a primary alcohol and is achiral as no new stereocenters are formed.

Step 3: Bromination (Formation of Product C)
*   Starting Material: 4-phenylbutan-1-ol (Product B).
*   Reagent: Phosphorus tribromide (PBr3).
*   Reaction Details: PBr3 is a standard reagent used to convert primary and secondary alcohols into their corresponding alkyl bromides via an SN2-type reaction.
*   Product C: The primary alcohol group (-OH) is substituted by a bromine atom.

Identity and Name of Final Product (C)
*   Structure: The final product has a phenyl group at one end of a four-carbon chain and a bromine atom at the other end (Ph-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-Br).
*   IUPAC Name: 1-bromo-4-phenylbutane.
*   Chirality: The final product, 1-bromo-4-phenylbutane, is achiral. The original chiral center was eliminated in the first step. The subsequent reactions did not create any new chiral centers, as no carbon atom in the final structure is bonded to four different substituents.

The numbers in the final IUPAC name equation, 1-bromo-4-phenylbutane, are 1 and 4.
