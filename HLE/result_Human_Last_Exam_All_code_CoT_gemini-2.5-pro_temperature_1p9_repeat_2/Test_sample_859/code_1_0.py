    Calculates the minimal number of new edges to make G' 2-edge-connected.
    Let d be an even integer. The degrees of the three vertices v1, v2, v3 are d, d+1, d+1.
    We demonstrated a construction for G that results in G' having l = d + 2 leaf blocks.
    The number of edges to add is ceil(l/2) = ceil((d+2)/2).
    Since d is even, d+2 is even, so the number of edges is (d+2)/2 = d/2 + 1.

    This function prints the derivation steps and the final formula.
