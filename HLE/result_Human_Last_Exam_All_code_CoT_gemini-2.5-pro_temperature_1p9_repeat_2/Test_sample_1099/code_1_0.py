def calculate_simulation_resources():
    """
    Calculates the minimal resources to simulate singlet state correlations with an LHV model.

    The problem can be framed using the CHSH inequality, where different models
    achieve different maximum scores (S):
    - Local Hidden Variable (LHV) models: S_LHV <= 2
    - Quantum Mechanics (Singlet State): S_Quantum <= 2 * sqrt(2) (Tsirelson's bound)
    - Non-signaling PR-Box: S_PR_Box <= 4

    To simulate the quantum correlations, we need to mix a classical LHV strategy
    with a non-local resource (like a PR-Box or communication).

    Scenario 1: Using a PR-Box
    We can create a mixed strategy that uses a PR-Box with probability 'p' and a
    local strategy with probability '1-p'. We need to find the minimal 'p'
    such that the average score equals the quantum maximum.
    
    The equation is:
    S_Quantum = p * S_PR_Box + (1-p) * S_LHV
    
    Solving for p:
    p = (S_Quantum - S_LHV) / (S_PR_Box - S_LHV)

    Scenario 2: Using Communication
    It has been proven that simulating these correlations requires, on average,
    exactly 1 bit of classical communication between the parties.

    This code will calculate the value of 'p' for the PR-Box scenario.
