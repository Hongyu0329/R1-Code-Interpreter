# The problem requires calculating the value of the expression:
# E = (2 * ||alpha||^2) / (pi^2/6 - 1) + 10^15
# From the derivation, we have found that ||alpha||^2 = 0.5 * (pi^2/6 - 1).

# Let's define the parts of the final expression based on this derivation.

# The term derived from the Basel series, which forms the denominator.
denominator = (math.pi**2 / 6) - 1

# The numerator of the fraction.
# Based on the derivation, numerator = 2 * ||alpha||^2 = 2 * 0.5 * (pi^2/6 - 1) = denominator.
numerator = 2 * (0.5 * denominator)

# The constant term to be added.
constant_term = 10**15

# As the derivation shows, the fraction part numerator/denominator simplifies to 1.
# The final result is an exact integer.
final_result = 1 + constant_term
