    "This problem requires an understanding of stereochemistry and elimination reaction mechanisms (E2) in cyclic systems. Let's break down the process step-by-step.\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type**: We are given (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane as the substrate and potassium tert-butoxide as the reagent. Potassium tert-butoxide is a strong, bulky base. This combination strongly suggests an E2 (bimolecular elimination) reaction.\n\n2.  **E2 Reaction Requirements**: The E2 mechanism has a strict stereochemical requirement, especially in cyclohexane rings. The leaving group (Bromine) and a proton on an adjacent carbon (a β-proton) must be in an *anti-periplanar* (or trans-diaxial) orientation. This means both must be in axial positions, pointing in opposite directions.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Substrate Conformation**:\n    *   The substrate is (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane. The (1S, 2R) configuration indicates that the bromine and methyl groups are *trans* to each other.\n    *   A cyclohexane ring exists in two primary chair conformations that are in equilibrium. For a *trans*-1,2-disubstituted cyclohexane, the substituents can be either both equatorial (e,e) or both axial (a,a). Wait, a *trans*-1,2-disubstituted cyclohexane is (axial, equatorial) or (equatorial, axial).\n    *   Let's analyze the two possible chair conformations:\n        *   **Conformation A**: The larger methyl group is in the more stable equatorial position, which forces the bromine atom into the axial position (ax, eq).\n        *   **Conformation B**: The methyl group is in the axial position, and the bromine is in the equatorial position (eq, ax).\n    *   Conformation A is significantly more stable because the bulky methyl group avoids unfavorable 1,3-diaxial interactions. Therefore, the molecule will predominantly exist in the conformation where the bromine is axial and the methyl group is equatorial.\n\n4.  **Determine Possible Products**: Since the reaction proceeds from Conformation A where the bromine is axial, we look for available β-protons that are also axial.\n    *   The carbons adjacent (β) to the bromine-bearing carbon (C1) are C2 and C6.\n    *   **β-proton at C2**: This carbon has a methyl group (equatorial) and a proton. This proton is in the axial position, making it trans-diaxial to the axial bromine. Elimination involving this proton would create a double bond between C1 and C2, yielding **1-methylcyclohexene** (the Zaitsev product, more substituted).\n    *   **β-proton at C6**: This carbon has two protons. One is axial, and one is equatorial. The axial proton is trans-diaxial to the axial bromine. Elimination involving this proton would create a double bond between C1 and C6, yielding **3-methylcyclohexene** (the Hofmann product, less substituted).\n\n5.  **Apply Hofmann's Rule**: The reagent, potassium tert-butoxide, is a very bulky base. Bulky bases have difficulty accessing sterically hindered protons.\n    *   The β-proton at C2 is sterically hindered by the adjacent equatorial methyl group.\n    *   The β-proton at C6 is sterically accessible.\n    *   Therefore, the bulky base will preferentially abstract the less hindered proton from C6. This leads to the formation of the less substituted alkene, the Hofmann product.\n\n**Conclusion**: The major product of the reaction is **3-methylcyclohexene**.\n\nThe following Python code outlines this reasoning to arrive at the final product.\n\n```python\ndef solve_reaction():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the E2 reaction of (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane\n    with potassium tert-butoxide to identify the major product.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Identify reactants and reaction conditions\n    substrate = \"(1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane\"\n    reagent = \"Potassium tert-butoxide (a strong, bulky base)\"\n    reaction_type = \"E2 elimination\"\n\n    print(f\"Analyzing the reaction of {substrate} with {reagent}.\")\n    print(f\"The conditions point towards an {reaction_type} mechanism.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 2: Explain the stereochemical requirement for E2 on a cyclohexane\n    print(\"Step 2: E2 Reaction Stereochemistry\")\n    print(\"An E2 reaction on a cyclohexane ring requires the leaving group (Br) and a beta-proton (H) to be in a trans-diaxial (anti-periplanar) orientation.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 3: Analyze the substrate's stable conformation\n    print(\"Step 3: Substrate Conformation Analysis\")\n    print(\"The substrate has a 'trans' relationship between the Br and methyl groups.\")\n    print(\"The most stable chair conformation places the larger methyl group in the equatorial position.\")\n    print(\"This forces the leaving group, Bromine, into the required AXIAL position.\")\n    print(\"This axial-Br conformation is reactive for E2 elimination.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    \n    # Step 4: Identify possible beta-protons and products\n    print(\"Step 4: Identify Possible Products\")\n    print(\"With an axial Bromine at C1, we look for axial protons on adjacent carbons (C2 and C6).\")\n    print(\"Path A (Zaitsev): Removing the axial proton from C2 yields 1-methylcyclohexene (a tri-substituted alkene).\")\n    print(\"Path B (Hofmann): Removing the axial proton from C6 yields 3-methylcyclohexene (a di-substituted alkene).\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 5: Determine the major product using Hofmann's Rule\n    print(\"Step 5: Applying Hofmann's Rule\")\n    print(\"Potassium tert-butoxide is a BULKY base.\")\n    print(\"Bulky bases preferentially attack the least sterically hindered proton.\")\n    print(\"The proton on C2 is hindered by the adjacent methyl group.\")\n    print(\"The proton on C6 is not hindered.\")\n    print(\"Therefore, the base will primarily remove the proton from C6, leading to the Hofmann product.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Final Conclusion\n    major_product = \"3-methylcyclohexene\"\n    print(f\"Final Answer: The major product of the reaction is {major_product}.\")\n\nsolve_reaction()\n```\n<<<3-methylcyclohexene>>>"
