    "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of linearly independent commutators of degree 10 that can be formed from two non-commuting variables, typically denoted as X and Y. This number corresponds to the dimension of the degree-10 homogeneous subspace of the free Lie algebra on two generators.\n\nThe most direct way to calculate this is by using Witt's formula, which gives the dimension `L_n(k)` of the `n`-th graded component of the free Lie algebra on `k` generators:\n\n`L_n(k) = (1/n) * Σ_{d|n} μ(d) * k^(n/d)`\n\nWhere:\n*   `n` is the degree, which is 10 in our case.\n*   `k` is the number of generators, which is 2 (for X and Y).\n*   The sum is over all positive divisors `d` of `n`.\n*   `μ(d)` is the Möbius function.\n\nOur plan is as follows:\n1.  Set `n=10` and `k=2`.\n2.  Find all positive divisors `d` of 10.\n3.  For each divisor `d`, calculate the value of the Möbius function `μ(d)`.\n4.  For each `d`, calculate the term `μ(d) * k^(n/d)`.\n5.  Sum all these terms and divide the result by `n=10`.\n6.  The Python script below will implement these steps and print out the detailed calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef get_prime_factors(num):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns a dictionary of prime factors and their multiplicities.\n    e.g., get_prime_factors(12) -> {2: 2, 3: 1}\n    \"\"\"\n    factors = {}\n    d = 2\n    temp = num\n    while d * d <= temp:\n        while temp % d == 0:\n            factors[d] = factors.get(d, 0) + 1\n            temp //= d\n        d += 1\n    if temp > 1:\n        factors[temp] = factors.get(temp, 0) + 1\n    return factors\n\ndef moebius(n):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the Moebius function μ(n).\"\"\"\n    if not isinstance(n, int) or n < 1:\n        raise ValueError(\"Input must be a positive integer.\")\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    \n    factors = get_prime_factors(n)\n    # If any prime factor has a power greater than 1, μ(n) is 0\n    if any(p > 1 for p in factors.values()):\n        return 0\n    \n    # Otherwise, μ(n) is (-1)^k where k is the number of distinct prime factors\n    return (-1) ** len(factors)\n\ndef get_divisors(n):\n    \"\"\"Returns a sorted list of all positive divisors of n.\"\"\"\n    divs = set()\n    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            divs.add(i)\n            divs.add(n // i)\n    return sorted(list(divs))\n\ndef solve_bch_nonzero_coeffs(n, k):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the number of nonzero coefficients of order n in the BCH expansion\n    using Witt's formula for a free Lie algebra with k generators.\n    \"\"\"\n    divs = get_divisors(n)\n    \n    total_sum = 0\n    symbolic_parts = []\n    calculated_parts = []\n    \n    for d in divs:\n        mu_d = moebius(d)\n        power = n // d\n        base_power_val = k ** power\n        term_val = mu_d * base_power_val\n        total_sum += term_val\n        \n        # Build symbolic part for the equation, e.g., \"(-1)*(2^5)\"\n        symbolic_parts.append(f\"({mu_d})*({k}^{power})\")\n        \n        # Build calculated part, e.g., \"- 32\"\n        if term_val >= 0:\n            calculated_parts.append(f\"+ {term_val}\")\n        else:\n            calculated_parts.append(f\"- {-term_val}\")\n\n    result = total_sum // n\n    \n    # Adjust the first calculated part to remove the leading \"+\"\n    if calculated_parts[0].startswith('+ '):\n        calculated_parts[0] = calculated_parts[0][2:]\n\n    # Construct the final equation string for printing\n    symbolic_str = \" + \".join(symbolic_parts)\n    calculated_str = \" \".join(calculated_parts)\n    \n    print(f\"The number of nonzero coefficients of order {n} is: {result}\")\n    print(\"\\nThis is found using Witt's formula L_n(k) = (1/n) * Σ_{d|n} μ(d) * k^(n/d)\")\n    print(f\"For n={n} and k={2}, the divisors are {divs}.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe full calculation is:\")\n    print(f\"(1/{n}) * ( {symbolic_str} )\")\n    print(f\"= (1/{n}) * ( {calculated_str} )\")\n    print(f\"= (1/{n}) * ({total_sum})\")\n    print(f\"= {result}\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    # Order of the expansion\n    order_n = 10\n    # Number of generators (X and Y)\n    generators_k = 2\n    solve_bch_nonzero_coeffs(order_n, generators_k)\n<<<99>>>\n```"
