    Solves the topology problem about the number of homeomorphism classes.
    
    The reasoning is as follows:
    
    1.  The problem asks for the number of distinct homeomorphism classes for a compact
        topological space X with two properties relating it to the long ray R = [0, ω₁).
    
    2.  Property (1) states that X contains a dense copy of R. This means X is a 
        'compactification' of R.
    
    3.  Property (2) states that every bounded continuous function f: R → ℝ extends to 
        a unique continuous function on X. This is the universal mapping property that
        uniquely defines the Stone-Čech compactification of R, denoted βR.
        
    4.  The Stone-Čech compactification of a Tychonoff space (like R) is unique up to
        a homeomorphism. This means that any two spaces, X₁ and X₂, that satisfy the
        given conditions must both be homeomorphic to βR.
        
    5.  By the transitive property of homeomorphism (if X₁ is homeomorphic to βR and
        βR is homeomorphic to X₂), it follows that X₁ is homeomorphic to X₂.
        
    6.  Therefore, all spaces X satisfying the given properties belong to the same
        homeomorphism class. This means there is only one such class.
