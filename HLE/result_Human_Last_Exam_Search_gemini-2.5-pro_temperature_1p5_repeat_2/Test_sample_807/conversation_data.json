    "The Crayola crayon color that likely contains 9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride is **Shocking Pink**.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the evidence:\n\n*   **Chemical Identity**: The chemical compound 9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride is more commonly known as **Rhodamine B**.\n\n*   **Color Properties of Rhodamine B**: Rhodamine B is a synthetic dye recognized for its vibrant, fluorescent pink to reddish-violet hue. It is also identified by other names such as C.I. Pigment Violet 1 and Basic Violet 10. One of its applications is in the creation of bright pink watercolors.\n\n*   **Crayola's Ingredients**: Crayola states that their crayons are primarily made of paraffin wax and various color pigments. However, the specific formulas for their crayon colors are considered proprietary information and are not publicly disclosed.\n\n*   **Fluorescent Crayons**: Crayola manufactures a line of \"Neon\" and \"Fluorescent\" crayons. These crayons are known to fluoresce under a black light, a characteristic feature of Rhodamine B. Among the fluorescent colors produced by Crayola are \"Shocking Pink,\" \"Ultra Pink,\" and \"Hot Magenta,\" which align with the color profile of Rhodamine B.\n\nBased on the bright, fluorescent pink color of Rhodamine B and its properties, it is highly probable that it is used as the pigment in the \"Shocking Pink\" Crayola crayon, or other similarly colored fluorescent crayons.\n\n<<<Shocking Pink>>>"
