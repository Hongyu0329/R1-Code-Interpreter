    "To determine the number of contracted Gaussian functions for toluene (C7H8) with a 6-31G basis set, we need to calculate the number of functions for each atom and then sum them up.\n\n### Analysis of the 6-31G Basis Set:\n\nThe notation \"6-31G\" describes how atomic orbitals are represented. It is a split-valence basis set:\n*   **Core Orbitals (e.g., 1s for Carbon):** Are described by a single contracted function.\n*   **Valence Orbitals (e.g., 2s, 2p for Carbon; 1s for Hydrogen):** Are \"split\" into two parts, an inner and an outer part, each represented by a separate contracted function.\n\n### Contracted Functions per Atom:\n\n*   **For each Hydrogen (H) atom:**\n    *   The 1s valence orbital is split into two functions (1s' and 1s'').\n    *   Total for H: **2 contracted functions**\n\n*   **For each Carbon (C) atom:**\n    *   **Core (1s orbital):** 1 contracted function.\n    *   **Valence (2s and 2p orbitals):**\n        *   The 2s orbital is split into two functions (2s' and 2s'').\n        *   The three 2p orbitals (2px, 2py, 2pz) are each split into two functions (e.g., 2px' and 2px''). This results in 3 * 2 = 6 functions for the p orbitals.\n    *   Total for C: 1 (for 1s) + 2 (for 2s) + 6 (for 2p) = **9 contracted functions**\n\n### Calculation for Toluene (C7H8):\n\nToluene has the chemical formula C7H8, which means it contains:\n*   7 Carbon atoms\n*   8 Hydrogen atoms\n\nNow, we can calculate the total number of contracted Gaussian functions:\n*   **From Carbon:** 7 atoms × 9 functions/atom = 63 functions\n*   **From Hydrogen:** 8 atoms × 2 functions/atom = 16 functions\n*   **Total:** 63 + 16 = 79 functions\n\nTherefore, a 6-31G basis set calculation for toluene uses a total of 79 contracted Gaussian functions.\n\n<<<79>>>"
