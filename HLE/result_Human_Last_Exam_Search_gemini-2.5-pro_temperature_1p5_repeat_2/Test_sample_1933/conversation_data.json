    "Answering this question involves a four-step process:\n1.  **Characterize the Class of Concepts:** We first need to understand the structure of the sets (concepts) that can be defined by the formulas in the given logical fragment.\n2.  **Define the Concept Class:** Based on this structure, we identify the overall concept class whose Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) dimension we need to compute.\n3.  **Establish a Lower Bound:** We show that the VC dimension is at least 4 by constructing a model and a set of 4 points that is shattered by the concept class.\n4.  **Establish an Upper Bound:** We show that the VC dimension is at most 4 by arguing that no set of 5 points can be shattered.\n\n### 1. Characterizing the Formulas\nThe logical fragment is $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$, where the schema $S$ contains four unary predicates, let's call them $P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4$.\n\nA formula $\\phi(x)$ in this fragment has one free variable, $x$, and is built using only existential quantifiers ($\\exists$), conjunction ($\\land$), and the constants for truth ($\\top$) and falsity ($\\bot$).\n\nAny such formula $\\phi(x)$ can be written in the form:\n$\\phi(x) \\equiv \\exists y_1, ..., y_k. \\psi(x, y_1, ..., y_k)$\nwhere $\\psi$ is a conjunction of atomic formulas. Since the predicates are unary, an atomic formula is of the form $P_i(z)$, where $z$ is one of the variables $\\{x, y_1, ..., y_k\\}$.\n\nWe can separate the conjuncts in $\\psi$ based on whether they involve the free variable $x$:\n$\\psi(x, \\vec{y}) = \\psi_x(x) \\land \\psi_{\\vec{y}}(\\vec{y})$\nwhere $\\psi_x(x)$ is the conjunction of all atoms involving $x$ (e.g., $P_1(x) \\land P_4(x)$), and $\\psi_{\\vec{y}}(\\vec{y})$ is the conjunction of all atoms that do not involve $x$.\n\nThe formula can then be rewritten as:\n$\\phi(x) \\equiv (\\exists \\vec{y}. \\psi_x(x) \\land \\psi_{\\vec{y}}(\\vec{y})) \\equiv \\psi_x(x) \\land (\\exists \\vec{y}. \\psi_{\\vec{y}}(\\vec{y}))$\nThe part $\\exists \\vec{y}. \\psi_{\\vec{y}}(\\vec{y})$ is a sentence (a formula with no free variables). For any given model (a universe with interpretations for the predicates), this sentence is either true or false for the entire model.\n*   If the sentence is true in a model, $\\phi(x)$ is equivalent to $\\psi_x(x)$.\n*   If the sentence is false in a model, $\\phi(x)$ is equivalent to $\\bot$ (False).\n\nThe formula $\\psi_x(x)$ is simply a conjunction of some subset of the base predicates applied to $x$, such as $\\bigwedge_{i \\in I} P_i(x)$ for some index set $I \\subseteq \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$. The empty conjunction (when $I=\\emptyset$) is $\\top$ (True).\n\n### 2. The Concept Class\nA model for this schema consists of a universe $U$ and four subsets $S_1, S_2, S_3, S_4$ of $U$, which are the interpretations of the predicates $P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4$.\n\nThe set of concepts (subsets of $U$) definable in any given model is therefore a subset of:\n$\\mathcal{C} = \\left\\{ \\bigcap_{i \\in I} S_i \\mid I \\subseteq \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\} \\right\\} \\cup \\{\\emptyset\\}$\nThis collection of sets includes:\n*   The entire universe $U$ (by choosing $I=\\emptyset$, corresponding to the formula $\\top$).\n*   The 4 base sets $S_1, S_2, S_3, S_4$.\n*   All possible intersections of these base sets.\n*   The empty set $\\emptyset$ (definable by $\\bot$).\n\nThe VC dimension of the logic is the maximum VC dimension of this concept class $\\mathcal{C}$ over all possible choices of the model (i.e., the universe $U$ and the sets $S_i$).\n\n### 3. Lower Bound (VC-dim $\\ge 4$)\nTo show that the VC dimension is at least 4, we must find a model and a set of 4 points $Y = \\{y_1, y_2, y_3, y_4\\}$ that is shattered by the corresponding concept class. Shattering means that for every one of the $2^4=16$ subsets of $Y$, there is a concept in our class that selects exactly that subset.\n\nLet's construct such a model:\n*   Let the universe be $U = Y = \\{y_1, y_2, y_3, y_4\\}$.\n*   For each $i \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$, define the interpretation of predicate $P_i$ as the set $S_i = Y \\setminus \\{y_i\\}$.\n\nNow, we must show that any subset $Y' \\subseteq Y$ can be generated as an intersection of some of the sets $S_i$. Let $Y'$ be an arbitrary subset of $Y$. Define an index set $I_{Y'} = \\{j \\mid y_j \\notin Y'\\}$. Consider the concept formed by the intersection $\\bigcap_{j \\in I_{Y'}} S_j$:\n$C = \\bigcap_{j \\in I_{Y'}} S_j = \\bigcap_{j \\in I_{Y'}} (Y \\setminus \\{y_j\\})$\n\nAn element $y_k \\in Y$ belongs to this set $C$ if and only if $y_k \\in Y \\setminus \\{y_j\\}$ for all $j \\in I_{Y'}$. This is equivalent to saying that $k \\neq j$ for all $j \\in I_{Y'}$, which in turn means $k \\notin I_{Y'}$. By our definition of $I_{Y'}$, $k \\notin I_{Y'}$ is equivalent to $y_k \\in Y'$.\n\nThus, $y_k \\in C \\iff y_k \\in Y'$, which means $C = Y'$.\nSince we can generate any subset $Y'$ of $Y$, the set $Y$ is shattered. This demonstrates that the VC dimension is at least 4.\n\n### 4. Upper Bound (VC-dim $\\le 4$)\nTo show that the VC dimension is at most 4, we must prove that no set of size 5 can be shattered.\nLet $Y = \\{y_1, y_2, y_3, y_4, y_5\\}$ be any set of 5 points in any model.\n\nThe number of distinct concepts available in our class $\\mathcal{C}$ is at most the number of ways to choose a subset $I \\subseteq \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$ plus one for the empty set. There are $2^4 = 16$ possible subsets $I$. This means that the concept class $\\mathcal{C}$ can contain at most $16 + 1 = 17$ distinct sets.\n\nTo shatter the set $Y$ of size 5, we would need to be able to generate every single one of its $2^5 = 32$ subsets. However, our concept class can only provide at most 17 different subsets. Since $17 < 32$, there are not enough concepts available to distinguish all the required subsets of $Y$.\n\nTherefore, no set of 5 points can be shattered by this concept class, regardless of the model. This implies that the VC dimension cannot be 5 or greater.\n\n### Conclusion\nFrom our analysis, we have established that the VC dimension is at least 4 and at most 4. Therefore, the VC dimension must be exactly 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
