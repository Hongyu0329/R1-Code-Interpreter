    "In a game of chess where the goal is to place the maximum number of bishops on the edge squares of the board without any attacking each other, a total of 14 bishops can be placed.\n\nA standard 8x8 chessboard has 28 edge squares. The problem of placing the maximum number of non-attacking bishops on a chessboard is a well-known mathematical puzzle. The maximum number of non-attacking bishops that can be placed on an n√ón board is 2n-2. For a standard 8x8 board, this number is 2 * 8 - 2 = 14. It has been established that in such configurations, the bishops must be placed on the edge squares.\n\nWith 14 bishops placed on the 28 available edge squares, there would be 14 edge squares left without bishops.\n\n<<<14>>>"
