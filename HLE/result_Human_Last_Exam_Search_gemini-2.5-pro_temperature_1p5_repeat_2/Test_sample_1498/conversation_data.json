    "In Sayyid Ahmad al-Marzuqi's poem, 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam' (The Creed of the Laymen), the names of the Prophets in Islam are mentioned from the 16th to the 19th bayt (verse).\n\nThe section begins after a verse that calls for the knowledge of the twenty-five prophets mentioned in the Quran. The four subsequent verses then list their names:\n\n**Verse 16:**\nهُمْ آدَمٌ إِدْرِيْسُ نُوْحٌ هُوْدٌ مَعْ ... صَالِحٍ وَإِبْرَاهِيْمُ كُلٌّ مُتَّبَعْ\n(They are Adam, Idris, Nuh, Hud, along with Salih and Ibrahim, each is followed)\n\n**Verse 17:**\nلُوْطٌ وَإِسْمَاعِيْلُ إِسْحَاقُ كَذَا ... يَعْقُوْبُ يُوْسُفُ وَأَيُّوْبُ احْتَذَى\n(Lut and Isma'il, Ishaq as well, Ya'qub, Yusuf, and Ayyub followed)\n\n**Verse 18:**\nشُعَيْبُ هَارُوْنُ وَمُوْسَى وَالْيَسَعْ ... ذُو الْكِفْلِ دَاوُدُ سُلَيْمَانُ اتَّبَعْ\n(Shu'ayb, Harun, and Musa and al-Yasa', Dhul-Kifl, Dawud, Sulayman followed)\n\n**Verse 19:**\nإِلْيَاسُ يُوْنُسُ زَكَرِيَّا يَحْيَى ... عِيْسَى وَطَهَ خَاتِمٌ دَعْ غَيَّا\n(Ilyas, Yunus, Zakariyya, Yahya, 'Isa, and Taha [a name for Prophet Muhammad], the seal, leave misguidance)\n\nThese verses are part of a larger section on the messengers, but these four specifically contain the enumeration of their names.\n\n<<<From the 16th to the 19th bayt.>>>"
