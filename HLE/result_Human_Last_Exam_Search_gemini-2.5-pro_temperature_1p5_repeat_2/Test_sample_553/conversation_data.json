    "The Beatles song that starts with a chord jump from the tonic to an altered fifth chord is \"Michelle\".\n\nThe song's introduction begins in the key of F minor. The opening chord progression features a move from the tonic F minor to a C augmented chord. In the key of F minor, the fifth degree is C, and a standard major fifth chord would be C major, while a minor fifth would be C minor. The use of a C augmented chord—an altered fifth—is a sophisticated and unusual harmonic choice that creates a distinct tension right at the start of the song.\n\nWhile not a direct jump from a tonic to a *minor* fifth, this progression from the tonic to an augmented fifth is a prominent and unique feature of the song's opening. Adding to the song's harmonic complexity, the verses of \"Michelle\" begin on an F major chord, creating an interesting ambiguity between the major and minor tonality. Much of the song's distinct French-influenced character comes from these advanced harmonic choices.\n\n<<<Michelle>>>"
