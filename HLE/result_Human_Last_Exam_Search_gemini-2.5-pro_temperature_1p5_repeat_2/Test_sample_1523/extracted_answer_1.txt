In finite-temperature field theory for a neutral scalar field `ϕ`, the inner product `(ϕ, D_ϕ)` in the functional integral representation of the partition function is given by the functional:

`(ϕ, D_ϕ) = ∫_0^β dτ ∫ d³x ϕ(x) [(-∂_τ² - ∇² + m²)ϕ(x)]`

where:
*   `β = 1/T` is the inverse temperature.
*   `τ` is the imaginary time coordinate.
*   `∇²` is the spatial Laplacian operator.
*   `m` is the mass of the scalar field.

This expression is equivalent to twice the free part of the Euclidean action for the scalar field.
