For a p-electron experiencing spin-orbit coupling, the common eigenvalues of the total angular momentum squared operator, $J^2$, and the z-component of the total angular momentum operator, $J_z$, are determined by the possible values of the total angular momentum quantum number, j. For a p-electron, l=1 and s=1/2, which gives j = 3/2 and j = 1/2.

The eigenvalues of $J^2$ are of the form ħ²j(j+1) and the eigenvalues of $J_z$ are m_jħ, where m_j ranges from -j to +j in integer steps.

For the j = 3/2 state:
The eigenvalue of $J^2$ is (15/4)ħ².
The eigenvalues of $J_z$ are (3/2)ħ, (1/2)ħ, (-1/2)ħ, and (-3/2)ħ.
The common eigenvalues are the pairs: ((15/4)ħ², (3/2)ħ), ((15/4)ħ², (1/2)ħ), ((15/4)ħ², (-1/2)ħ), and ((15/4)ħ², (-3/2)ħ).

For the j = 1/2 state:
The eigenvalue of $J^2$ is (3/4)ħ².
The eigenvalues of $J_z$ are (1/2)ħ and (-1/2)ħ.
The common eigenvalues are the pairs: ((3/4)ħ², (1/2)ħ) and ((3/4)ħ², (-1/2)ħ).
