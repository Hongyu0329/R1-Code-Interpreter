    "### Unraveling the Eigenvalues of a p-electron in Spin-Orbit Coupling\n\nIn the quantum mechanical problem of a p-electron, the interaction between its orbital angular momentum and spin angular momentum, a phenomenon known as spin-orbit coupling, leads to a splitting of energy levels. The common eigenvalues of the square of the total angular momentum operator, $J^2$, and the z-component of the total angular momentum operator, $J_z$, characterize these new states.\n\nFor a p-electron, the orbital angular momentum quantum number is **l = 1**, and the electron's intrinsic spin quantum number is **s = 1/2**. The total angular momentum, **J**, is the sum of the orbital and spin angular momenta, **J = L + S**. The quantum number **j** for the total angular momentum can take values from |l - s| to l + s in integer steps. In this case, the possible values for j are:\n\n*   j = 1 + 1/2 = **3/2**\n*   j = |1 - 1/2| = **1/2**\n\nThese two values of j correspond to two distinct energy levels, often referred to as a doublet.\n\nThe eigenvalues of the $J^2$ operator are given by the formula **ħ²j(j+1)**, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant. The eigenvalues of the $J_z$ operator are given by **m_jħ**, where the magnetic quantum number **m_j** can take values from -j to +j in integer steps.\n\nFor the state with **j = 3/2**, the eigenvalues are:\n*   Eigenvalue of $J^2$: ħ² * (3/2) * (3/2 + 1) = **(15/4)ħ²**\n*   Eigenvalues of $J_z$: For j = 3/2, m_j can be **-3/2, -1/2, 1/2, 3/2**. This results in four eigenvalues for $J_z$: **(-3/2)ħ, (-1/2)ħ, (1/2)ħ, (3/2)ħ**.\n\nFor the state with **j = 1/2**, the eigenvalues are:\n*   Eigenvalue of $J^2$: ħ² * (1/2) * (1/2 + 1) = **(3/4)ħ²**\n*   Eigenvalues of $J_z$: For j = 1/2, m_j can be **-1/2, 1/2**. This results in two eigenvalues for $J_z$: **(-1/2)ħ, (1/2)ħ**.\n\nTherefore, the common sets of eigenvalues for ($J^2$, $J_z$) are:\n\n*   For j = 3/2: **((15/4)ħ², (-3/2)ħ), ((15/4)ħ², (-1/2)ħ), ((15/4)ħ², (1/2)ħ), ((15/4)ħ², (3/2)ħ)**\n*   For j = 1/2: **((3/4)ħ², (-1/2)ħ), ((3/4)ħ², (1/2)ħ)**\n\nThese sets of eigenvalues define the possible states of a p-electron when considering spin-orbit coupling, with the degeneracy of the original p-orbital energy level being lifted into two distinct manifolds corresponding to j=3/2 and j=1/2.\n\n<<<For a p-electron experiencing spin-orbit coupling, the common eigenvalues of the total angular momentum squared operator, $J^2$, and the z-component of the total angular momentum operator, $J_z$, are determined by the possible values of the total angular momentum quantum number, j. For a p-electron, l=1 and s=1/2, which gives j = 3/2 and j = 1/2.\n\nThe eigenvalues of $J^2$ are of the form ħ²j(j+1) and the eigenvalues of $J_z$ are m_jħ, where m_j ranges from -j to +j in integer steps.\n\nFor the j = 3/2 state:\nThe eigenvalue of $J^2$ is (15/4)ħ².\nThe eigenvalues of $J_z$ are (3/2)ħ, (1/2)ħ, (-1/2)ħ, and (-3/2)ħ.\nThe common eigenvalues are the pairs: ((15/4)ħ², (3/2)ħ), ((15/4)ħ², (1/2)ħ), ((15/4)ħ², (-1/2)ħ), and ((15/4)ħ², (-3/2)ħ).\n\nFor the j = 1/2 state:\nThe eigenvalue of $J^2$ is (3/4)ħ².\nThe eigenvalues of $J_z$ are (1/2)ħ and (-1/2)ħ.\nThe common eigenvalues are the pairs: ((3/4)ħ², (1/2)ħ) and ((3/4)ħ², (-1/2)ħ).>>>"
