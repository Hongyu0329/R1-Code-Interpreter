The ideal Ni/Ce ratio to maximize catalytic performance is not a single value, but depends on the specific reaction and catalyst formulation. For the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction, the optimal range for nickel content is generally between 7 and 12.5 wt%. For water splitting, the optimal ratio is often expressed in molar terms and has been reported to be around a Ce/Ni molar ratio of 2 or a 1:1:1 molar ratio for Ni:Fe:Ce in more complex systems.
