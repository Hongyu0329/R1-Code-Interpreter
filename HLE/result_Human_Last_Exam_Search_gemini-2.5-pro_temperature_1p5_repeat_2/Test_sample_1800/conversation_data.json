    "### Optimal Nickel-Ceria Ratio Varies for Water Gas Shift and Water Splitting Reactions\n\nThe ideal ratio of nickel to cerium in Ni-Ceria nanoparticles for maximizing catalytic performance is not a single value but rather falls within a range that is dependent on the specific reaction—be it the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction or water splitting—as well as the catalyst's formulation and synthesis method.\n\nFor the **Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction**, research indicates that the optimal nickel content generally lies between **7 and 12.5 weight percent (wt%)**. Studies have shown high carbon monoxide (CO) conversion rates within this range. For instance, one study focusing on the reverse WGS (rWGS) reaction identified an optimum nickel proportion of around 7 molar percent. Another investigation into Ni/CeO2 catalysts for the WGS reaction found that CO conversion was nearly identical and high for samples with 10 and 12.5 wt% Ni. Furthermore, in carbon-supported Ni-Ceria catalysts, a 10 wt.% CeO2 loading was found to be effective, underlining the importance of the metallic phase for good performance.\n\nIn the context of **water splitting**, the ideal Ni/Ce ratio appears to differ and is often expressed as a molar ratio. One study on Ni3N-CeO2/NF nanoparticles for electrolytic water splitting found that a **Ce/Ni molar ratio of 2** was optimal for both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In a different approach using Ni, Fe co-doped ceria, a high doping level of 20 mol% with a 1:1 ratio of Ni to Fe in CeO2 showed excellent water splitting activity. Another investigation on a complex catalyst, NiCo2S4@Ce-NiFe LDH/CeO2, highlighted the beneficial role of cerium in enhancing the performance for overall water splitting, although a specific optimal ratio was not detailed. A separate study on a NiCe-2 catalyst reported a **Ni:Fe:Ce molar ratio of 1:1:1** as being the most effective for water electrolysis.\n\nThe variation in the ideal ratio is attributed to the synergistic interaction between nickel and ceria. Ceria's ability to store and release oxygen creates oxygen vacancies, which are crucial for the catalytic cycles of both the WGS reaction and water splitting. The optimal Ni/Ce ratio represents a balance where nickel dispersion is maximized, and the interaction with ceria is enhanced, leading to improved catalytic activity and stability. The specific synthesis method and the presence of other dopants or support materials also play a significant role in determining the most effective catalyst composition.\n\n<<<The ideal Ni/Ce ratio to maximize catalytic performance is not a single value, but depends on the specific reaction and catalyst formulation. For the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction, the optimal range for nickel content is generally between 7 and 12.5 wt%. For water splitting, the optimal ratio is often expressed in molar terms and has been reported to be around a Ce/Ni molar ratio of 2 or a 1:1:1 molar ratio for Ni:Fe:Ce in more complex systems.>>>"
