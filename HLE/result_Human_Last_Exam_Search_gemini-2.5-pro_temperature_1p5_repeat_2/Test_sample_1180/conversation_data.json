    "To determine the thickness of the double point of the stable reduction, we must first find a suitable model of the curve and resolve its singularities in the special fiber over the residue field $\\mathbb{F}_2$.\n\nThe curve is given by the equation $C: z^2 = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1$. We work over a 2-adic field $K$ with a valuation $v$ normalized such that $v(2)=1$. The ring of integers is $\\mathcal{O}_K$ (e.g., $\\mathbb{Z}_2$) and the residue field is $k = \\mathbb{F}_2$.\n\n1.  **Initial Model and its Reduction:**\n    The equation over $\\mathcal{O}_K$ is $z^2 - 2x^5 - 2x^3 - 1 = 0$.\n    Reducing this equation modulo 2, we get:\n    $z^2 - 1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2}$, which is $(z-1)^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2}$.\n    This shows that the special fiber of this model is a non-reduced line defined by $z=1$. The model is singular, and the singular locus is the entire line.\n\n2.  **Change of Coordinates:**\n    To analyze the singularity, we perform a change of variables to center the singular line at 0. Let $y = z-1$. Substituting $z = y+1$ into the original equation gives:\n    $(y+1)^2 = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1$\n    $y^2 + 2y + 1 = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1$\n    $y^2 + 2y = 2x^5 + 2x^3$\n    $y(y+2) = 2x^3(x^2+1)$\n    This is the equation for a new model of the curve. The special fiber is now given by $y^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2}$, which is the line $y=0$.\n\n3.  **Blowing up a Singular Point:**\n    The model is still singular. To resolve the singularity, we perform a blow-up. A standard technique is to blow up a point on the singular locus, for instance, the origin $(x,y)=(0,0)$. The blow-up of the affine plane $\\mathbb{A}^2$ at the origin is covered by two affine charts.\n\n    *   **Chart 1:** Let $x_1 = x$ and $y_1 = y/x$. This means $y = x_1y_1$.\n        Substituting this into the equation $y^2 + 2y - 2x^5 - 2x^3 = 0$:\n        $(x_1y_1)^2 + 2(x_1y_1) - 2x_1^5 - 2x_1^3 = 0$\n        $x_1^2y_1^2 + 2x_1y_1 - 2x_1^3(x_1^2+1) = 0$\n        We can divide by $x_1$ to get the equation of the strict transform of the curve:\n        $x_1y_1^2 + 2y_1 - 2x_1^2(x_1^2+1) = 0$\n        The reduction of this equation modulo 2 is $x_1y_1^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$. The special fiber in this chart is the union of two lines: $x_1=0$ (the exceptional divisor) and $y_1=0$ (the strict transform), but the component $y_1=0$ has multiplicity 2. This means the intersection at $(x_1, y_1)=(0,0)$ is not a simple node, so the model is not yet semi-stable.\n\n    *   **Chart 2:** Let $x_2 = x/y$ and $y_2 = y$. This means $x=x_2y_2$.\n        Substituting into $y(y+2) = 2x^3(x^2+1)$:\n        $y_2(y_2+2) = 2(x_2y_2)^3((x_2y_2)^2+1)$\n        Dividing by $y_2$ (for the strict transform):\n        $y_2+2 = 2x_2^3y_2^2((x_2y_2)^2+1)$\n        Reducing modulo 2: $y_2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$. This component does not intersect the exceptional divisor in this chart.\n\n4.  **Second Blow-up:**\n    We need to resolve the singularity at $(x_1, y_1)=(0,0)$ in Chart 1. Let $u=x_1, v=y_1$. The equation is $uv^2 + 2v - 2u^2(u^2+1) = 0$. We blow up the origin $(u,v)=(0,0)$.\n\n    *   We analyze the chart where $u' = u/v$ and $v'=v$. So $u=u'v'$.\n        Substituting into the equation:\n        $(u'v') (v')^2 + 2v' - 2(u'v')^2( (u'v')^2+1 ) = 0$\n        $u'(v')^3 + 2v' - 2(u')^2(v')^2 (\\dots) = 0$\n        Dividing by $v'$ gives the strict transform:\n        $u'(v')^2 + 2 - 2(u')^2v'(\\dots) = 0$\n        Let's rewrite this as:\n        $u'(v')^2 = 2( (u')^2v'(\\dots) - 1 )$\n        Let $\\epsilon = (u')^2v'(\\dots) - 1$. At the singular point we are analyzing, $(u', v') \\to (0,0)$, so $\\epsilon$ is a 2-adic unit, $v(\\epsilon)=0$.\n        The local equation of the singularity is now of the form $u'(v')^2 = 2\\epsilon$.\n\n5.  **Interpretation and Thickness:**\n    A singularity of the form $XY=t$ corresponds to a node of thickness $v(t)$. Our singularity is of the form $UV^2=t$, which is a cusp. In the context of stable reductions, to resolve such a singularity and obtain a node, a quadratic extension is typically needed, corresponding to taking a square root. This process transforms the equation into something of the form $X Y = \\sqrt{t}$. The thickness of the resulting node is then $v(\\sqrt{t}) = v(t)/2$.\n\n    In our case, the local equation is $u'(v')^2 = 2\\epsilon$. So we have $t = 2\\epsilon$. The valuation is $v(t) = v(2\\epsilon) = v(2) + v(\\epsilon) = 1+0=1$.\n    The thickness of the double point in the stable reduction is therefore $v(t)/2 = 1/2$.\n\n>>>\n1/2"
