    "The first Academy Award for Best Picture winner to depict a Luxor Obelisk on-screen is challenging to definitively identify through available text-based and image search results. However, the 1951 Best Picture winner, ***An American in Paris***, is the most probable candidate.\n\nThe film features an extended seventeen-minute ballet sequence that is celebrated for its artistry and serves as the film's climax. This sequence includes a scene set in a stylized representation of the Place de la Concorde in Paris, the location of the Luxor Obelisk. The set for this part of the ballet was designed in the artistic style of French painter Raoul Dufy and prominently features the fountain of the Place de la Concorde. A model of this fountain set is preserved in the National Museum of American History. While descriptions repeatedly highlight the fountain and the overall artistic vision of the square, they do not explicitly mention the depiction of the obelisk itself.\n\nThe subsequent Best Picture winner with a Parisian setting, *Around the World in 80 Days* (1956), includes scenes in Paris. The narrative in the film follows Phileas Fogg's arrival at the Gare du Nord and a visit to a travel agency on the rue de Rivoli before departing by balloon from a set built on a studio backlot. The available information on this film does not indicate any scenes were filmed at or depict the Place de la Concorde.\n\nAlthough visual confirmation of the Luxor Obelisk in *An American in Paris* is not available through the conducted research, the presence of a scene set in its specific location makes it the most likely first Best Picture winner to have depicted the monument.\n\n<<<An American in Paris>>>"
