    "There are **two** finite groups that contain maximal by inclusion product-free sets of size 3. These groups are the cyclic group of order 6 (*C₆*) and the symmetric group on three elements (*S₃*).\n\nA subset *S* of a group *G* is called product-free if for any two elements *a, b ∈ S* (which are not necessarily distinct), their product *ab* is not in *S*. A product-free set is considered maximal by inclusion if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set within the same group.\n\nThe two groups are:\n1.  **The cyclic group of order 6 (C₆):** The set *S* = {*a², a³*} in the additive group ℤ₆ (isomorphic to C₆) would correspond to {*g², g³*} where *g* is a generator. This is not the correct set. In the multiplicative group *C₆* = {*e, a, a², a³, a⁴, a⁵*}, the set *S* = {*a, a³, a⁵*} is a maximal product-free set of size 3. The product of any two of these elements results in an element with an even exponent ({*e, a², a⁴*}), none of which are in *S*. Furthermore, any element not in *S* is a product of two elements from *S*, so the set is maximal.\n2.  **The symmetric group on three elements (S₃):** This group is also known as the dihedral group of order 6 (*D₆*). It has six elements. The set *S* consisting of the three transpositions (elements of order 2), *S* = {(1 2), (1 3), (2 3)}, is a maximal product-free set. The product of any two of these elements is a 3-cycle or the identity, none of which are in *S*. The remaining elements of the group (the identity and the two 3-cycles) are all products of elements from *S*, confirming its maximality.\n\nThis classification was established by G.L. Walls in a 1999 paper. While some more recent publications have presented different lists of such groups, these have been found to contain errors. Independent analysis and expert review have confirmed that several of the proposed additional groups, such as *C₅*, *C₈*, and *D₈*, do not actually contain maximal product-free sets of size 3.\n\n<<<2>>>"
