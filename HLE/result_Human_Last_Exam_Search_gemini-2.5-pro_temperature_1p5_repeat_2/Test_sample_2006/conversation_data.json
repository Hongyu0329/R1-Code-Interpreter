    "This haiku is a riddle pointing to a specific set of items that need to be alphabetized. Here is a breakdown of the clues:\n\n*   **\"An August tempest\"**: This points to the historical figure of Emperor Augustus. The month of August was named in his honor. A \"tempest\" can refer to the political upheaval and civil wars from which he emerged as the sole ruler of Rome.\n*   **\"Twice fifteen brings winds of change\"**: \"Twice fifteen\" equals thirty. This refers to the year 30 BC, a pivotal year when Augustus (then Octavian) defeated Mark Antony and Cleopatra, annexing Egypt and bringing a massive \"wind of change\" that marked the end of the Roman Republic and the beginning of the Roman Empire.\n*   **\"A divine one yields\"**: This alludes to Cleopatra, who was considered a goddess by her people. She yielded to Augustus by taking her own life.\n\nThe title, \"The Bays,\" is a pun on \"The Bees.\" The question, therefore, is \"What are the bees?\" The bee was a significant symbol for Emperor Augustus and was also used by other rulers to symbolize industry and order. While there is no definitive, universally recognized list of Augustus's bees, the riddle likely refers to the different types of bees within a hive, which would be a fitting symbol for the new order Augustus brought to Rome.\n\nThe answer, a list of types of bees in alphabetical order, is:\n\n<<<Drone, Queen, Worker>>>"
