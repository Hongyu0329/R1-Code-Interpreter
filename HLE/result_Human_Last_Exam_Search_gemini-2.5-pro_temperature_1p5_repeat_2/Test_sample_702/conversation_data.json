    "I have gathered information about the definitions of the spaces and maps, connectivity, loop spaces, suspension spectra, and smash products. The initial search has provided some context on the EHP sequence, which is relevant for computing homotopy groups of spheres and understanding maps between them. However, I need to specifically address the connectivity of the map $\\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$. To do this, I will need to understand the connectivity of the domain and codomain separately and then use properties of the map, which is induced by a map of homotopy fibers. I need to find out more about the relationship between the loop space of a smash product and the smash product of loop spaces.\n\nI will now update the plan to focus on these more specific questions.I have gathered some initial information about the spaces and the map in question. I understand that the connectivity of a map is determined by the vanishing of the lower homotopy groups of its homotopy fiber. To analyze the connectivity of $\\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$, I need to understand the connectivity of the domain and codomain, and then the properties of the map itself.\n\nThe domain is the suspension of a smash product of loop spaces. The codomain is the loop space of a smash product of spheres.\n\nFrom the search results, I know the following:\n- The homotopy groups of a loop space are the shifted homotopy groups of the original space: $\\pi_i(\\Omega X) \\cong \\pi_{i+1}(X)$.\n- The smash product of spheres is a sphere: $S^4 \\wedge S^6 \\simeq S^{10}$.\n- The homotopy groups of spheres are generally non-trivial.\n- A map induced by homotopy fibers relates the homotopy fibers of two maps in a commutative diagram.\n\nHowever, I still need more specific information to determine the connectivity. My current understanding is insufficient to determine the connectivity of the domain and codomain and the effect of the map on homotopy groups. Specifically, I need to find information about:\n\n1.  The homotopy type of $\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6$. In particular, its connectivity.\n2.  The connectivity of $\\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$. How does suspension affect the connectivity of a smash product of loop spaces?\n3.  The connectivity of $\\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6) \\simeq \\Omega S^{10}$.\n4.  The nature of the map $\\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$ and how a \"map of homotopy fibers\" is defined in this context and how it affects connectivity.\n\nI will update my plan to search for this more specific information.I have gathered more information. Here's a summary of what I've found and what's still missing.\n\n**Known:**\n\n*   **Connectivity of Loop Spaces and Spheres:** I know that $\\pi_i(\\Omega S^n) \\cong \\pi_{i+1}(S^n)$. This tells me that $\\Omega S^4$ is 2-connected (since $\\pi_i(S^4)=0$ for $i<4$) and $\\Omega S^6$ is 4-connected. The codomain, $\\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6) \\simeq \\Omega S^{10}$, is 8-connected.\n*   **Suspension and Connectivity:** The suspension of a space generally increases its connectivity. The Freudenthal suspension theorem provides a precise statement about this.\n*   **Smash Products and Connectivity:** The connectivity of a smash product $X \\wedge Y$ is related to the connectivity of $X$ and $Y$.\n*   **EHP Sequence and James-Hopf Invariants:** The EHP sequence relates the homotopy groups of spheres through a series of fibrations, and the maps in this sequence are related to James-Hopf invariants. These invariants are maps of the form $\\Omega \\Sigma X \\to \\Omega \\Sigma (X^{\\wedge n})$. The problem seems to be related to these concepts.\n*   **Map of Homotopy Fibers:** This suggests the map in question arises from a larger homotopy commutative diagram, and its properties are determined by the other maps in the diagram.\n\n**Missing Information:**\n\n*   **Connectivity of the domain $\\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$:** While I know the connectivity of the individual loop spaces, I need to determine the connectivity of their smash product, $\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6$, and how the suspension functor $\\Sigma$ then affects this connectivity. There isn't a simple formula for the connectivity of a smash product of arbitrary spaces.\n*   **Precise definition of the map:** The phrase \"induced by a map of homotopy fibers\" is still too general. I need to find a more concrete description of the map $\\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$. It's likely related to the James-Hopf invariants or a similar construction that connects loop spaces of spheres. I suspect there's a natural map from $\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6$ to $\\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$ whose suspension is the map in question.\n*   **Relationship between $\\Omega X \\wedge \\Omega Y$ and $\\Omega(X \\wedge Y)$:** There are maps between these spaces, but they are not generally homotopy equivalences. Understanding the connectivity of the map between them is crucial.\n\nMy next step will be to focus on the relationship between the smash product of loop spaces and the loop space of a smash product, as this seems to be the core of the problem. I will also look for specific constructions of maps between these spaces.I'm getting closer to a solution. Hereâ€™s a summary of my progress:\n\n**1. Connectivity of the Codomain:**\n\nThe codomain is $\\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$. Since $S^4 \\wedge S^6$ is homotopy equivalent to $S^{10}$, the codomain is $\\Omega S^{10}$. The space $\\Omega S^{10}$ is $(10-2) = 8$-connected because $\\pi_i(\\Omega S^{10}) \\cong \\pi_{i+1}(S^{10})$, and the homotopy groups of $S^{10}$ vanish for indices less than 10.\n\n**2. Connectivity of the Domain:**\n\nThe domain is $\\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$.\n*   $\\Omega S^4$ is $(4-2) = 2$-connected.\n*   $\\Omega S^6$ is $(6-2) = 4$-connected.\n*   The connectivity of the smash product $\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6$ is more complex. A general formula for the connectivity of a smash product $X \\wedge Y$ is $\\text{conn}(X \\wedge Y) \\ge \\text{conn}(X) + \\text{conn}(Y) + 1$. In our case, this would be $2 + 4 + 1 = 7$. So, $\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6$ is at least 7-connected.\n*   The suspension $\\Sigma$ of a $k$-connected space is $(k+1)$-connected. Therefore, the domain $\\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$ is at least $(7+1) = 8$-connected.\n\n**3. The Map and its Properties:**\n\nThe map in question, $\\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$, is likely related to the James-Hopf invariants and the EHP sequence, which deals with fibrations involving loop spaces and smash products. Specifically, there is a natural map $\\Omega X \\wedge \\Omega Y \\to \\Omega(X \\wedge Y)$ which is a component of the Hilton-Milnor theorem. The map in the problem is the suspension of this natural map.\n\n**Remaining Gaps and Plan:**\n\nThe key to solving this problem lies in determining the precise connectivity of the smash product of the two loop spaces and understanding the \"map of homotopy fibers\" context. The lower bound of 8-connectivity for the domain matches the connectivity of the codomain, suggesting the map might induce an isomorphism on the first non-trivial homotopy group. To confirm this and find the precise connectivity of the map, I need to:\n\n1.  Find a more precise result for the connectivity of $\\Omega S^n \\wedge \\Omega S^m$ than the general formula.\n2.  Identify the specific \"map of homotopy fibers\" and the larger commutative diagram it belongs to. This is crucial for understanding the map's effect on homotopy groups. The context likely comes from a standard construction in stable homotopy theory.\n3.  Combine these pieces of information to analyze the homotopy fiber of the map $\\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$. The connectivity of the map is one less than the connectivity of its homotopy fiber.\n\nMy next step will be to search for more specific literature on the Hilton-Milnor theorem and its relation to the James-Hopf invariants, focusing on the connectivity of the maps involved. I will also search for computations of the homotopy groups of smash products of loop spaces of spheres.To determine the connectivity of the map $f: \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$, we first analyze the connectivity of the domain and the codomain. The connectivity of a map is determined by the homotopy groups of its homotopy fiber. A map is $k$-connected if it induces an isomorphism on homotopy groups $\\pi_i$ for $i < k$ and an epimorphism for $i=k$.\n\n### Connectivity of the Codomain\n\nThe codomain is $\\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$. The smash product of spheres is homotopy equivalent to a sphere:\n$S^4 \\wedge S^6 \\simeq S^{10}$.\nTherefore, the codomain is homotopy equivalent to $\\Omega S^{10}$.\n\nThe homotopy groups of a loop space are given by $\\pi_i(\\Omega X) \\cong \\pi_{i+1}(X)$. A sphere $S^n$ is $(n-1)$-connected, meaning its homotopy groups $\\pi_i(S^n)$ are trivial for $i < n$.\nThus, $S^{10}$ is $(10-1) = 9$-connected.\nThe loop space $\\Omega S^{10}$ is therefore $(9-1) = 8$-connected. Its first non-trivial homotopy group is in dimension 9:\n$\\pi_9(\\Omega S^{10}) \\cong \\pi_{10}(S^{10}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n### Connectivity of the Domain\n\nThe domain is $\\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$.\n1.  **Connectivity of Loop Spaces:**\n    *   $S^4$ is $(4-1)=3$-connected. Thus, $\\Omega S^4$ is $(3-1)=2$-connected. Its first non-trivial homotopy group is $\\pi_3(\\Omega S^4) \\cong \\pi_4(S^4) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n    *   $S^6$ is $(6-1)=5$-connected. Thus, $\\Omega S^6$ is $(5-1)=4$-connected. Its first non-trivial homotopy group is $\\pi_5(\\Omega S^6) \\cong \\pi_6(S^6) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n2.  **Connectivity of the Smash Product:**\n    For CW complexes $X$ and $Y$ that are $c_X$-connected and $c_Y$-connected respectively, their smash product $X \\wedge Y$ is $(c_X + c_Y + 1)$-connected.\n    The connectivity of $\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6$ is therefore at least $(2 + 4 + 1) = 7$.\n    The Hurewicz theorem and the KÃ¼nneth formula for homology imply that the first non-trivial homotopy group of $\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6$ occurs at dimension $3+5=8$, so $\\pi_8(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$. Thus, $\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6$ is exactly 7-connected.\n\n3.  **Connectivity of the Suspension:**\n    The suspension of a $k$-connected space is $(k+1)$-connected.\n    Therefore, the domain $\\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$ is $(7+1) = 8$-connected. Its first non-trivial homotopy group is in dimension 9:\n    $\\pi_9(\\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)) \\cong \\pi_8(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n### The Map and its Connectivity\n\nThe map $f: \\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$ is described as being \"induced by a map of homotopy fibers\". This suggests it is a natural map arising from standard constructions in homotopy theory. The most relevant construction is the one formalized by the Hilton-Milnor theorem, which describes the loop space of a wedge sum. This involves maps related to Samelson and Whitehead products.\n\nLet's consider the adjoint of the map $f$, which is $\\tilde{f}: \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6 \\to \\Omega^2(S^4 \\wedge S^6) \\simeq \\Omega^2 S^{10}$. The codomain $\\Omega^2 S^{10}$ is $(10-2-1) = 7$-connected, and its first non-trivial homotopy group is $\\pi_8(\\Omega^2 S^{10}) \\cong \\pi_{10}(S^{10}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$. The domain is also 7-connected with $\\pi_8(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nThe map in question is deeply related to the James-Hopf invariants, which are central to the EHP sequence that computes homotopy groups of spheres. A key result, due to G.W. Whitehead, is that the fiber of the natural map (the Samelson product) $j: \\Omega X \\wedge \\Omega Y \\to \\Omega(X \\wedge Y)$ is the loop space of the join, $\\Omega(X*Y)$.\n\nFor our case, let $X=S^4$ and $Y=S^6$. The join $S^4 * S^6$ is homotopy equivalent to $S^{4+6+1}=S^{11}$. The homotopy fiber of the map $j: \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6 \\to \\Omega S^{10}$ is therefore $\\Omega S^{11}$. Since $\\Omega S^{11}$ is 9-connected, the map $j$ is $(9+1) = 10$-connected.\n\nThe map in the prompt is not $j$, but a related map from a suspension. However, the foundational map is $j$. An analysis of the long exact sequence of homotopy groups for the fibration $\\Omega S^{11} \\to \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6 \\to \\Omega S^{10}$ shows that the map $j$ induces an isomorphism on $\\pi_i$ for $i \\leq 9$.\n\nSince the domain and codomain of the original map $f$ are both 8-connected and their first non-trivial homotopy groups occur at dimension 9 and are both isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}$, a natural map arising from fundamental homotopy constructions is expected to be an isomorphism on this first non-trivial group. This would make the map 9-connected.\n\n<<<The map is 9-connected.>>>"
