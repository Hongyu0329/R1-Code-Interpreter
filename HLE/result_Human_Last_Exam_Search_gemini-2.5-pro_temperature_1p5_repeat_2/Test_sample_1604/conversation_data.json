    "### The Battle of Agagia in 1916 is the latest historical battle depicted in a painting by the artist Lady Butler.\n\nElizabeth Butler, a renowned British painter of military scenes, created a significant body of work throughout her career, capturing moments from various conflicts involving the British Army. While many of her famous pieces portray 19th-century battles such as the Napoleonic Wars and the Crimean War, she continued to paint well into the 20th century, documenting events from the First World War.\n\nAmong her paintings of World War I is \"The Charge of the Dorset Yeomanry at Agagia,\" which portrays a battle that took place on February 26, 1916, in Egypt during the Senussi Campaign. This painting depicts a cavalry charge by the Dorset Yeomanry against Senussi tribesmen who were allied with the Ottoman and German Empires.\n\nOther notable battles from earlier periods captured by Lady Butler include:\n*   **The Battle of Waterloo (1815)**, depicted in her famous work \"Scotland Forever!\".\n*   **The Battle of Quatre Bras (1815)**, shown in \"The 28th Regiment at Quatre Bras\".\n*   **The First Anglo-Afghan War (1842)**, with her painting \"Remnants of an Army\".\n*   **The Crimean War (1853-1856)**, illustrated in paintings like \"The Roll Call,\" \"Balaclava,\" and \"The Return from Inkerman\".\n*   **The Anglo-Zulu War (1879)**, with \"The Defence of Rorke's Drift\".\n*   **The First Boer War (1881)**, in \"Floreat Etona!\", which depicts an incident at the Battle of Laing's Nek.\n*   **The Anglo-Egyptian War (1882)**, in her painting of the Battle of Tel-el-Kebir.\n*   **The early stages of World War I**, including \"In the Retreat from Mons: The Royal Horse Guards,\" showing events of August and September 1914.\n\nWhile she also painted a scene from the Battle of Loos which took place in September 1915, the Battle of Agagia in February 1916 remains the latest historical battle scene identified among her works.\n\n<<<The Battle of Agagia>>>"
