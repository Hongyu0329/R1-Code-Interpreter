    "The space-time, double Fourier transform of the generalized pair correlation function is commonly called the **dynamic structure factor**, denoted as S(k, ω), in the nuclear criticality community and related fields of neutron physics and condensed matter physics.\n\nThe generalized pair correlation function, G(r, t), describes the probability of finding a particle at a position **r** at a time **t**, given that there was a particle at the origin (r=0) at time t=0. When a double Fourier transform is applied to this function—one transform over space **r** and another over time **t**—the resulting function is the dynamic structure factor, S(k, ω). The variable **k** represents the wavevector (momentum transfer), which is the Fourier conjugate to the spatial variable **r**. The variable **ω** represents the angular frequency (energy transfer), the Fourier conjugate to the time variable **t**.\n\nIn the context of nuclear criticality and reactor physics, this quantity is fundamental for describing the scattering of neutrons in a medium. The intensity of inelastic neutron scattering, a key experimental technique, is directly proportional to the dynamic structure factor. This relationship is crucial for understanding the thermal motion and correlation of nuclei in reactor materials.\n\nThe thermal scattering law, often denoted as S(α, β) in nuclear data libraries used for criticality safety calculations, is essentially the dynamic structure factor expressed in dimensionless units of momentum (α) and energy (β) transfer. This information is vital for the accurate modeling of neutron transport and behavior in nuclear systems, which is a cornerstone of nuclear criticality safety analysis.\n\n<<<dynamic structure factor>>>"
