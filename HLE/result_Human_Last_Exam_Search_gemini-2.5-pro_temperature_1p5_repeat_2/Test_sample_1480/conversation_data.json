    "In the context of fuzzy logic systems, including interval type-3 fuzzy sets, the activation level of a rule is determined by a t-norm (triangular norm) operation. The term `Phi_k(x′)` represents the firing strength of the antecedent (the \"IF\" part) of the k-th rule, and `μG_k_j(y_j)` represents the membership degree of the output variable `y_j` in the consequent fuzzy set (the \"THEN\" part). The t-norm is used to combine these two values.\n\nA t-norm generalizes the logical AND operation for fuzzy sets. Since the problem specifies \"a t-norm operation\" without naming a specific one, the result depends on which t-norm is chosen. The most common t-norms are the minimum and the product.\n\nHere are the calculations for the most prominent t-norms using the provided values: `Phi_k(x′)=0.7` and `μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9`.\n\n1.  **Minimum t-norm:** This is the most frequently used t-norm in Mamdani fuzzy systems.\n    *   **Formula:** `T_min(a, b) = min(a, b)`\n    *   **Calculation:** `min(0.7, 0.9) = 0.7`\n\n2.  **Product t-norm:** This t-norm is also widely used and scales the consequent membership function.\n    *   **Formula:** `T_prod(a, b) = a * b`\n    *   **Calculation:** `0.7 * 0.9 = 0.63`\n\n3.  **Lukasiewicz t-norm:** This is another common t-norm.\n    *   **Formula:** `T_L(a, b) = max(0, a + b - 1)`\n    *   **Calculation:** `max(0, 0.7 + 0.9 - 1) = max(0, 0.6) = 0.6`\n\nWithout further specification, the activation level using the most common t-norm (minimum) is 0.7.\n\n<<<0.7>>>"
