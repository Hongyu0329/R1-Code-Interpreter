    "The value computed between heartbeats when tracking HR and HRV using PPG is called the **inter-beat interval (IBI)**. This is the time duration between two consecutive heartbeats, typically measured in milliseconds.\n\nWhile HRV is a measure of the variation of these intervals, the interval itself is the fundamental value. In the context of an electrocardiogram (ECG), this same value is often referred to as the **R-R interval**, which is the time between successive R-peaks in the QRS complex of the heart's electrical cycle. When using photoplethysmography (PPG), which detects changes in blood volume, the term inter-beat interval (IBI) is more commonly used. Other terms used for this value include \"beat-to-beat interval\" and \"cycle length\".\n\n<<<inter-beat interval (IBI)>>>"
