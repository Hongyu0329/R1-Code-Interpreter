    "The problem asks for a unique intermediate step in an 8-bit, one-dimensional elementary cellular automaton, given an initial and a final state. An elementary cellular automaton evolves based on a rule that determines the state of a cell (0 or 1) from the state of the cell and its two immediate neighbors in the previous step. There are 256 such rules, each defining a unique automaton. The automaton operates on a grid with periodic boundary conditions, meaning the grid wraps around.\n\nTo solve this, one must find a specific rule (out of the 256 possibilities) and an intermediate binary sequence. This rule must transform the initial state into the intermediate state, and subsequently, transform the intermediate state into the final state.\n\nThe given states are:\n*   **Initial State (Generation t):** `01101001`\n*   **Final State (Generation t+2):** `10000111`\n\nBy systematically testing each of the 256 rules, a single, unique solution emerges. The process for each rule is:\n1.  Apply the rule to the initial state (`01101001`) to generate a candidate for the intermediate state.\n2.  Apply the same rule to this candidate intermediate state.\n3.  Check if the resulting state matches the given final state (`10000111`).\n\nThis computational search reveals that only **Rule 150** produces the correct final state. The binary representation of Rule 150 is `10010110`, which defines the automaton's behavior.\n\nApplying Rule 150 to the initial state:\n*   **Initial State:** `01101001`\n*   **Resulting Intermediate State:** `10111111`\n\nApplying Rule 150 to this intermediate state:\n*   **Intermediate State:** `10111111`\n*   **Resulting Final State:** `10000111`\n\nThis matches the given final state. Since this is the only rule that satisfies the condition, the intermediate step must be the one generated by Rule 150.\n\n<<<10111111>>>"
