    "To fully identify the Permutation of the Last Layer (PLL) case in the CFOP method for a 3x3 Rubik's Cube, a solver needs to observe a minimum of five non-top-facing stickers.\n\nWhen solving the last layer, the initial step is to orient all the pieces so that the top face is a solid color. This leaves 21 possible permutations of the pieces within that layer, known as PLL cases. To distinguish between these cases, it is necessary to examine the stickers on the side faces of the top layer.\n\nIt is a common technique to recognize all PLL cases by looking at only two adjacent sides of the cube. These two faces have a total of six stickers (three on each face, excluding the top-oriented stickers). However, not all six of these stickers are required to uniquely identify the PLL case.\n\nThe minimum information needed is as follows:\n*   **One sticker from each of the three visible corner pieces.** This helps to determine the permutation of the corners.\n*   **The stickers of the two visible edge pieces.** This determines the permutation of the edges.\n\nThis totals five stickers. With the knowledge of the color scheme of the cube, the information from these five stickers is sufficient to deduce the positions of all the pieces in the last layer and, therefore, identify the specific PLL case.\n\n<<<5>>>"
