The value of the measure for a Grassmann variable integral is not a constant number but is defined by the fundamental integration rules: the integral of the measure itself is zero (∫ dη = 0), and the integral of the Grassmann variable is one (∫ dη η = 1). These rules, along with the anticommuting nature of Grassmann variables (η²=0), enforce the Pauli exclusion principle.
