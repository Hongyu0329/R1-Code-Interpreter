    "Recent work in algebraic K-theory provides methods to compute the K-groups of rings like $\\mathbb{Z}/p^k\\mathbb{Z}$. For the ring in question, $\\mathbb{Z}/27\\mathbb{Z}$, we have $p=3$ and $k=3$.\n\nThe algebraic K-groups of $\\mathbb{Z}/p^k\\mathbb{Z}$ can be calculated, and theoretical results describe their structure. According to a result by Angeltveit, for the unramified case of $\\mathbb{Z}/p^n\\mathbb{Z}$, the order of the K-groups can be related by the formula: $\\#K_{2i-1}(\\mathbb{Z}/p^n; \\mathbb{Z}_p) \\cdot \\#K_{2i-2}(\\mathbb{Z}/p^n; \\mathbb{Z}_p) = p^{i(n-1)}$. This formula connects the sizes of consecutive K-groups.\n\nA significant recent development is the \"even vanishing conjecture\". This conjecture posits that for $i > p\\lceil\\frac{k}{p-1}\\rceil - 1$, the even K-groups $K_{2i-2}(\\mathbb{Z}/p^k\\mathbb{Z})$ are zero. This conjecture has been verified in the specific case required here. For $\\mathbb{Z}/27\\mathbb{Z}$, we have $p=3$ and $k=3$. The formula gives:\n\n$i > 3 \\cdot \\lceil\\frac{3}{3-1}\\rceil - 1 = 3 \\cdot \\lceil 1.5 \\rceil - 1 = 3 \\cdot 2 - 1 = 5$\n\nThis implies that $K_{2i-2}(\\mathbb{Z}/27\\mathbb{Z})$ should be zero for $i > 5$. This means the even K-groups $K_m$ are predicted to be zero for $m = 2i-2 > 2(5)-2 = 8$. Therefore, $K_{10}, K_{12}, K_{14}, \\dots$ are all expected to be zero.\n\nThe largest value of $2n$ for which the K-group is non-zero would be when $2n=8$, which corresponds to $i=5$. Thus, the largest natural number $n$ such that $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/27\\mathbb{Z})$ is nonzero is $n=4$.\n\n"
