    "The search results are about packing puzzles in general and do not contain a specific answer to this problem. They confirm that \"packing problems\" are a category of puzzles and that finding the optimal solution can be complex. My logical derivation seems to be the appropriate way to solve this.\n\nThe two partitioning methods I explored both yielded the same result of 351 blocks.\n\nMethod 1:\n1.  Fill a 9x15x15 region with blocks aligned along the 9-unit dimension: `(9/9) * (15/1) * (15/1) = 225` blocks.\n2.  The remaining space is a 6x15x15 block. In this space, fill a 6x9x15 region with blocks aligned along the new 9-unit dimension: `(6/1) * (9/9) * (15/1) = 90` blocks.\n3.  The remaining space is a 6x6x15 block. In this space, fill a 6x6x9 region with blocks aligned along the last 9-unit dimension: `(6/1) * (6/1) * (9/9) = 36` blocks.\n4.  The final remaining space is a 6x6x6 cube, into which no 9x1x1 block can fit.\n5.  Total blocks: 225 + 90 + 36 = 351.\n\nMethod 2:\nPartition the 15x15x15 cube with planes at x=9, y=9, and z=9, creating 8 sub-blocks. Then, pack each sub-block optimally.\n*   One 9x9x9 block: `(9/9)*(9/1)*(9/1) = 81` blocks.\n*   Three 9x9x6 blocks: `3 * [(9/9)*(9/1)*(6/1)] = 3 * 54 = 162` blocks.\n*   Three 9x6x6 blocks: `3 * [(9/9)*(6/1)*(6/1)] = 3 * 36 = 108` blocks.\n*   One 6x6x6 block: 0 blocks.\n*   Total blocks: 81 + 162 + 108 = 351.\n\nBoth logical and systematic approaches give the same result, which strongly suggests that 351 is the correct answer. The total volume of these blocks is `351 * 9 = 3159` cubic units. The volume of the cube is `15*15*15 = 3375` cubic units. The wasted volume is `3375 - 3159 = 216` cubic units, which corresponds to the 6x6x6 sub-volume that is left unpacked in both partitioning schemes.\n\n<<<351>>>"
