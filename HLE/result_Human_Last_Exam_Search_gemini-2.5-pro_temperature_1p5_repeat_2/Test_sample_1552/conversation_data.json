    "The second coefficient in the heat kernel expansion, known as the Seeley-DeWitt coefficient `a₂`, is a local geometric invariant that plays a crucial role in quantum field theory and the spectral action formalism. For a massless gauged Dirac spinor field on a four-dimensional Riemannian manifold, this coefficient is computed from the square of the Dirac operator, which is an operator of Laplace type.\n\nThe general form of the second Seeley-DeWitt coefficient `a₂(x)` for a Laplace-type operator `Δ = -g^{μν}∇_μ∇_ν + E` acting on sections of a vector bundle over a curved manifold is given by the trace of a combination of curvature tensors and the field strength of the gauge connection.\n\nFor a massless Dirac spinor coupled to a gauge field, the relevant operator is the square of the gauged Dirac operator, `D²`. The heat kernel expansion is then an asymptotic series in powers of a parameter 't':\n\n`Tr[exp(-t D²)] ~ (4πt)⁻² ∫ d⁴x √g [a₀(x) + t a₁(x) + t² a₂(x) + ...]`\n\nThe coefficients `a₀` and `a₁` correspond to the cosmological constant and the Einstein-Hilbert action, respectively. The second coefficient, `a₂(x)`, for a massless Dirac spinor in four dimensions is given by:\n\n<<<`a_2(x) = tr( (1/12) F_{μν} F^{μν} ) + (1/240) C_{μνρσ} C^{μνρσ} - (1/360) R^2 + (1/30) R_{μν} R^{μν}`>>>"
