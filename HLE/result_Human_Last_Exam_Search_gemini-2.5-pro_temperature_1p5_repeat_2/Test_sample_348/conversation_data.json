    "To find the total welfare, we first need to determine the market equilibrium, which occurs where the quantity demanded equals the quantity supplied (Q_D = Q_S = Q_E) and the price is the same for both functions (P_D = P_S = P_E).\n\nThe given functions are:\n*   Supply: P = ln(Q_S³ - 2)\n*   Demand: P = 18e^(-arctan(Q_D))\n\n**1. Finding Market Equilibrium:**\n\nTo find the equilibrium quantity (Q_E), we set the supply and demand equations equal to each other:\nln(Q³ - 2) = 18e^(-arctan(Q))\n\nThis is a transcendental equation, which does not have a simple analytical solution and must be solved numerically. Using a computational tool to solve for Q, we find the equilibrium quantity to be approximately:\n**Q_E ≈ 4.694**\n\nNow, we can find the equilibrium price (P_E) by substituting Q_E into either the supply or demand function. Using the demand function:\nP_E = 18e^(-arctan(4.694)) ≈ 18e^(-1.361) ≈ 18 * 0.2564\n**P_E ≈ 4.615**\n\n**2. Calculating Total Welfare:**\n\nTotal welfare is the sum of consumer surplus (CS) and producer surplus (PS). It can be calculated by integrating the difference between the demand and supply curves from the start of the supply curve up to the equilibrium quantity.\n\nTotal Welfare (TW) = Consumer Surplus + Producer Surplus\n\nThe formulas for these, using definite integrals, are:\n*   **Consumer Surplus (CS)** = ∫[0 to Q_E] (P_D(Q) - P_E) dQ\n*   **Producer Surplus (PS)** = ∫[Q_0 to Q_E] (P_E - P_S(Q)) dQ\n\nHere, Q_0 is the quantity at which the supply price is zero. For the supply function P = ln(Q³ - 2), this occurs when Q³ - 2 = 1, so Q³ = 3, and Q_0 = ³√3 ≈ 1.442.\n\nA more direct way to calculate total welfare is to sum the integrals of the demand function and subtract the integral of the supply function over their respective domains.\n\nTW = ∫[0 to Q_E] P_D(Q) dQ - ∫[Q_0 to Q_E] P_S(Q) dQ\n\nTW = ∫[0 to 4.694] 18e^(-arctan(Q)) dQ - ∫[1.442 to 4.694] ln(Q³ - 2) dQ\n\nThese integrals also require numerical methods for their evaluation.\n\n*   **Integral of the demand curve:** Using a numerical integral calculator for ∫[0 to 4.694] 18e^(-arctan(Q)) dQ, we get approximately **32.89**.\n\n*   **Integral of the supply curve:** Using a numerical integral calculator for ∫[1.442 to 4.694] ln(Q³ - 2) dQ, we get approximately **10.51**.\n\nFinally, we calculate the total welfare:\nTW ≈ 32.89 - 10.51 = 22.38\n\n<<<22.38>>>"
