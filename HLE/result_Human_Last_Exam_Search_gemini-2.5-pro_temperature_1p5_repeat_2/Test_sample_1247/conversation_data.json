    "The number of 1324-avoiding permutations of length n with k inversions, denoted \\(av_n^k(1324)\\), is a subject of combinatorial research. For a small number of inversions (k), and for a sufficiently large length (n), this quantity can be expressed as a polynomial in n.\n\nFor the case of k=3 inversions, the number of such permutations for n=3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 is given by the sequence 1, 6, 16, 35, 66, 112. An analysis of the differences between consecutive terms reveals that for n ≥ 4, the sequence can be described by a cubic polynomial.\nThe differences are as follows:\n*   First differences: 5, 10, 19, 31, 46\n*   Second differences: 5, 9, 12, 15\n*   Third differences: 4, 3, 3, 3\n\nThe third differences become constant for n ≥ 5, indicating a cubic polynomial relationship for \\(av_n^3(1324)\\) for n ≥ 4. By fitting a polynomial to these values, we can derive the formula:\n\n\\(av_n^3(1324) = \\frac{n^3 - 6n^2 + 13n - 8}{2}\\) for n ≥ 4.\n\nWe can verify this formula for the first few values:\n*   For n=4: \\(\\frac{4^3 - 6(4^2) + 13(4) - 8}{2} = \\frac{64 - 96 + 52 - 8}{2} = \\frac{12}{2} = 6\\).\n*   For n=5: \\(\\frac{5^3 - 6(5^2) + 13(5) - 8}{2} = \\frac{125 - 150 + 65 - 8}{2} = \\frac{32}{2} = 16\\).\n*   For n=6: \\(\\frac{6^3 - 6(6^2) + 13(6) - 8}{2} = \\frac{216 - 216 + 78 - 8}{2} = \\frac{70}{2} = 35\\).\n\nThis formula holds for the known values. We can now use it to determine \\(av_{333}^3(1324)\\) by substituting n=333:\n\n\\(av_{333}^3(1324) = \\frac{333^3 - 6(333^2) + 13(333) - 8}{2}\\)\n\\(av_{333}^3(1324) = \\frac{333(333^2 - 6 \\times 333 + 13) - 8}{2}\\)\n\\(av_{333}^3(1324) = \\frac{333(110889 - 1998 + 13) - 8}{2}\\)\n\\(av_{333}^3(1324) = \\frac{333(108904) - 8}{2}\\)\n\\(av_{333}^3(1324) = \\frac{36265032 - 8}{2}\\)\n\\(av_{333}^3(1324) = \\frac{36265024}{2}\\)\n\\(av_{333}^3(1324) = 18,132,512\\)\n\n<<<18132512>>>"
