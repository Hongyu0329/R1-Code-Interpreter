    "The number of 10-step self-avoiding walks on a Manhattan lattice, denoted as a(10), is 44,100.\n\nA self-avoiding walk is a path on a lattice that does not visit the same point more than once. The \"Manhattan lattice\" is another term for the square lattice. For a square lattice, the number of self-avoiding walks has been calculated for various step lengths. The initial values in the sequence are:\n*   a(1) = 4\n*   a(2) = 12\n*   a(3) = 36\n*   a(4) = 100\n\nContinuing this sequence, the value for a 10-step self-avoiding walk is 44,100.\n\n<<<44100>>>"
