    "<<<Yes, it follows that $f = 0$.\n\nHere is a step-by-step justification:\n\n1.  **The Fourier Transform and its Derivatives:**\n    Let $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ be a Schwartz class function. The Fourier transform of $f$, denoted by $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$, is defined as:\n    $$ \\hat{f}(\\xi) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(x) e^{-2\\pi i x \\xi} dx $$\n    A key property of Schwartz functions is that the Fourier transform maps the Schwartz space onto itself. This means if $f$ is a Schwartz function, then so is $\\hat{f}$. In particular, $\\hat{f}$ is an infinitely differentiable function ($C^\\infty$).\n\n2.  **Relating Moments to Derivatives of the Fourier Transform:**\n    The derivatives of the Fourier transform can be computed by differentiating under the integral sign:\n    $$ \\frac{d^k \\hat{f}}{d\\xi^k}(\\xi) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} (-2\\pi i x)^k f(x) e^{-2\\pi i x \\xi} dx $$\n    Evaluating these derivatives at $\\xi = 0$ gives a direct relationship with the moments of the function $f$:\n    $$ \\hat{f}^{(k)}(0) = (-2\\pi i)^k \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x^k f(x) dx $$\n    This relationship is a cornerstone in the study of wavelets and signal processing, where the vanishing of moments is a crucial property.\n\n3.  **Applying the Given Condition:**\n    The problem states that $\\int_{\\mathbb{R}} x^k f(x) dx = 0$ for all non-negative integers $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$. Using the formula from the previous step, this implies that:\n    $$ \\hat{f}^{(k)}(0) = 0 \\quad \\text{for all } k \\in \\mathbb{N} $$\n    So, the Fourier transform of $f$ has all of its derivatives at the origin equal to zero.\n\n4.  **Taylor's Theorem and the Properties of Schwartz Functions:**\n    Since $\\hat{f}$ is a $C^\\infty$ function, we can use Taylor's theorem with an integral remainder to express $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$ around the origin. For any integer $N > 0$, we have:\n    $$ \\hat{f}(\\xi) = \\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} \\frac{\\hat{f}^{(k)}(0)}{k!} \\xi^k + R_N(\\xi) $$\n    As all derivatives at the origin are zero, this simplifies to $\\hat{f}(\\xi) = R_N(\\xi)$. The remainder term is given by:\n    $$ R_N(\\xi) = \\frac{\\xi^N}{(N-1)!} \\int_0^1 (1-t)^{N-1} \\hat{f}^{(N)}(t\\xi) dt $$\n    Since $\\hat{f}$ is a Schwartz function, all of its derivatives are bounded on $\\mathbb{R}$. Let $C_N = \\sup_{u \\in \\mathbb{R}} |\\hat{f}^{(N)}(u)| < \\infty$. We can then bound the remainder:\n    $$ |\\hat{f}(\\xi)| = |R_N(\\xi)| \\le \\frac{|\\xi|^N}{(N-1)!} C_N \\int_0^1 (1-t)^{N-1} dt = \\frac{C_N}{N!} |\\xi|^N $$\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    This inequality, $|\\hat{f}(\\xi)| \\le \\frac{C_N}{N!} |\\xi|^N$, holds for any integer $N$. For any fixed value of $\\xi$, the term on the right-hand side tends to zero as $N \\to \\infty$, because the factorial $N!$ grows much faster than $|\\xi|^N$. Therefore, for any $\\xi \\in \\mathbb{R}$, we must have:\n    $$ |\\hat{f}(\\xi)| = 0 $$\n    This means that $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$ is identically the zero function. Since the Fourier transform is an isomorphism on the Schwartz space, if $\\hat{f}=0$, then the original function $f$ must also be the zero function."
