The product of the Favorskii rearrangement of 2-chlorocyclohexanone is cyclopentanecarboxylic acid. While a precise numerical value for its BÃ¶ttcher Molecular Complexity cannot be provided without direct calculation, it is estimated to be a relatively low value, likely well under 60 mcbit, reflecting its simple cyclic structure and common functional group.
