    "### Conditions for an FGH-Tripled Fixed Point Established\n\nFor the functions F: X × Y × Z → X, G: Y × X × Y → Y, and H: Z × Y × X → Z to have a tripled fixed point, specific conditions must be met within the framework of partially ordered metric spaces. The concept, termed an \"FGH-tripled fixed point,\" was introduced by Deepa Karichery and Shaini Pulickakunnel in their 2017 paper, \"Generalized Form of Tripled Fixed Point Theorems in Partially Ordered Metric Spaces.\" This concept serves as a generalization of a standard tripled fixed point and an extension of an FG-coupled fixed point.\n\nAn element (x, y, z) in the Cartesian product X × Y × Z is defined as an **FGH-tripled fixed point** if the following three conditions are satisfied:\n*   F(x, y, z) = x\n*   G(y, x, y) = y\n*   H(z, y, x) = z\n\nThe existence and uniqueness of such a point are primarily guaranteed by two main conditions: a **mixed monotone property** and a **contractive condition**.\n\n#### Core Conditions:\n\n1.  **Partially Ordered Metric Spaces:** The sets X, Y, and Z must be partially ordered metric spaces. This means each set is equipped with a partial order relation (≤) and a metric (d) that makes it a complete metric space. The Cartesian product X × Y × Z is endowed with a partial order and a metric derived from the individual spaces.\n\n2.  **Mixed Monotone Property:** The mappings F, G, and H must satisfy a \"mixed monotone property.\" This property dictates how the functions behave with respect to the partial order. For a function F(x, y, z), it is generally expected to be monotone non-decreasing in its first and third arguments and non-increasing in its second argument. Analogous properties must hold for G and H with respect to their arguments.\n\n3.  **Contractive Condition:** The functions must satisfy a contractive-type condition. This condition ensures that when the mappings are applied iteratively, the distance between successive points decreases, leading to convergence to a fixed point. A typical contractive condition for an FGH-tripled fixed point would look like:\n    *d(F(x,y,z), F(u,v,w)) + d(G(y,x,y), G(v,u,v)) + d(H(z,y,x), H(w,v,u)) ≤ k * [d(x,u) + d(y,v) + d(z,w)]*\n    for all x ≥ u, y ≤ v, and z ≥ w, where k is a constant in [0, 1).\n\n4.  **Existence of an Initial Point:** There must exist an initial point (x₀, y₀, z₀) in X × Y × Z that satisfies a specific relationship with the functions F, G, and H, which serves as the starting point for the iterative sequence that will converge to the fixed point. For example, a condition could be x₀ ≤ F(x₀, y₀, z₀), y₀ ≥ G(y₀, x₀, y₀), and z₀ ≤ H(z₀, y₀, x₀).\n\n5.  **Continuity or Regularity of the Space:** Either the functions F, G, and H are continuous, or the partially ordered metric spaces (X, Y, Z) must have a property that ensures convergence of monotone sequences. This condition is necessary to guarantee that the limit of the iterative sequence is indeed a fixed point.\n\n#### Uniqueness:\n\nFor the FGH-tripled fixed point to be unique, an additional condition is typically required. This condition often states that for any two tripled points, there exists a third point in the space that is comparable to both. This ensures that the contractive condition can be applied to any pair of fixed points, forcing them to be identical.\n\nIn essence, the existence of an FGH-tripled fixed point is guaranteed when the mappings contract distances between comparable elements in complete, partially ordered metric spaces, and there is a suitable starting point for an iterative process.### Conditions for an FGH-Tripled Fixed Point Established\n\nFor the functions F: X × Y × Z → X, G: Y × X × Y → Y, and H: Z × Y × X → Z to have a tripled fixed point, specific conditions must be met within the framework of partially ordered metric spaces.
