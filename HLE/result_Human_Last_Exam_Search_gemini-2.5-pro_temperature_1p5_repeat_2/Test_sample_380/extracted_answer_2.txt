The local magnetic field at the L1 point is not considered radial for the calculation of normalized magnetic helicity. The Interplanetary Magnetic Field (IMF) at L1 typically forms a Parker spiral, making an angle of about 45 degrees with the radial direction. The definition of normalized magnetic helicity using magnetic field components perpendicular to the radial direction (Y and Z) is a simplification that assumes the local magnetic field is aligned with the radial (X) axis. In practice, researchers perform a coordinate transformation to a system aligned with the local mean magnetic field and use the components perpendicular to that local field for the calculation. Your expectation that components perpendicular to the local magnetic field should be used is correct, and this is the standard scientific practice.
