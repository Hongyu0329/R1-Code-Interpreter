    "The continued fraction associated with the generalized Markov number \\( m_{4/7} \\) is determined by the methods described in the paper \"A Generalization of Markov Numbers\" by Esther Banaian and Archan Sen. In their work, they define a generalized Markov equation as \\( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + xy + xz + yz = 6xyz \\).\n\nThe authors provide an algorithm and a corresponding table that lists the continued fractions for the generalized Markov numbers \\( m_{p/q} \\) for various rational numbers \\( p/q \\). The continued fraction for \\( m_{4/7} \\) is explicitly listed in this table.\n\nThe continued fraction associated with the generalized Markov number \\( m_{4/7} \\) is ****.\n\n<<<>>>"
