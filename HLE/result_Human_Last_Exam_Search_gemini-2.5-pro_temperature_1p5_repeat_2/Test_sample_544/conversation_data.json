    "The reaction described is a Pummerer rearrangement. In this type of reaction, a sulfoxide is activated by an anhydride, in this case, triflic anhydride. Triflic anhydride is a particularly powerful activator.\n\nThe general steps of the reaction are:\n1.  **Activation**: The oxygen atom of the methyl phenyl sulfoxide attacks the triflic anhydride, forming a good leaving group and a sulfonium intermediate.\n2.  **Formation of a thionium ion**: A base abstracts a proton from the methyl group, which is alpha to the sulfur. This is followed by the elimination of the leaving group to form a reactive electrophilic intermediate called a thionium ion.\n3.  **Nucleophilic attack**: The cyanide ion, provided by the trimethylsilyl cyanide (TMSCN), then attacks the electrophilic carbon of the thionium ion.\n\nThis sequence of reactions results in the formation of a new carbon-sulfur and carbon-cyanide bond, yielding an Î±-cyano sulfide. The specific product from the reaction of methyl phenyl sulfoxide is 2-(phenylsulfanyl)ethanenitrile, which is also commonly known as (phenylthio)acetonitrile.\n\nThe IUPAC name for the product, Ph-S-CH2-CN, is 2-(phenylsulfanyl)ethanenitrile.\n\n<<<2-(phenylsulfanyl)ethanenitrile>>>"
