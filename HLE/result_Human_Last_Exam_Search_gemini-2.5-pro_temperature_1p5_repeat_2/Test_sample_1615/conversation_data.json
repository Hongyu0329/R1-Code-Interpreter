    "Let $G$ be a graph with $n = 12345$ vertices and a maximum degree of $\\Delta(G)$. The graph $G$ is not a complete graph ($K_n$). We need to find the maximum number of colors required for a proper vertex coloring of $G$, which is also known as the chromatic number, $\\chi(G)$.\n\nA complete graph with $n$ vertices, denoted $K_n$, requires $n$ colors for a proper coloring, since every vertex is connected to every other vertex. For this problem, the graph $G$ has 12345 vertices but is not a complete graph.\n\nAccording to Brooks's Theorem, for any connected graph $G$ that is not a complete graph or an odd cycle, its chromatic number is at most its maximum degree, i.e., $\\chi(G) \\le \\Delta(G)$. If $G$ is a complete graph or an odd cycle, the chromatic number is $\\Delta(G) + 1$.\n\nLet's analyze the properties of graph $G$:\n*   Number of vertices $n = 12345$.\n*   The graph is not the complete graph $K_{12345}$.\n\nWe consider the possibilities based on Brooks's Theorem:\n\n1.  **If G is an odd cycle:** The number of vertices is 12345, which is an odd number. An odd cycle with 12345 vertices has a maximum degree $\\Delta(G) = 2$ and requires 3 colors. This is a possible chromatic number, but we are looking for the *maximum* possible number of colors.\n\n2.  **If G is not an odd cycle and not a complete graph:** By Brooks's Theorem, the chromatic number is at most the maximum degree, $\\chi(G) \\le \\Delta(G)$. The maximum possible degree for any vertex in a graph with 12345 vertices is $12344$. Therefore, for any such graph, $\\chi(G) \\le \\Delta(G) \\le 12344$.\n\nTo find the maximum number of colors, we need to determine if a chromatic number of 12344 is achievable.\n\nConsider a graph $G$ created by taking the complete graph $K_{12345}$ and removing a single edge between two vertices, let's call them $u$ and $v$.\n*   This graph is not complete.\n*   The maximum degree of this graph is $\\Delta(G) = 12344$. For any vertex other than $u$ and $v$, it is still connected to 12344 other vertices.\n*   This graph is not an odd cycle.\n*   Therefore, by Brooks's Theorem, $\\chi(G) \\le \\Delta(G) = 12344$.\n\nNow we need to find the minimum number of colors required for this specific graph. Let's try to color it:\n*   Since vertices $u$ and $v$ are not connected, we can assign them the same color, say Color 1.\n*   All the other 12343 vertices are connected to each other (forming a $K_{12343}$ subgraph) and are also connected to both $u$ and $v$.\n*   This means none of the other 12343 vertices can use Color 1.\n*   Furthermore, since these 12343 vertices are all mutually connected, they each require a unique color.\n*   Thus, we need 1 color for vertices $u$ and $v$, and 12343 additional, distinct colors for the other vertices.\n\nThe total number of colors required is $1 + 12343 = 12344$.\n\nSince we have constructed a graph with 12345 vertices that is not a complete graph and has a chromatic number of 12344, this is the maximum possible value.\n\n<<<12344>>>"
