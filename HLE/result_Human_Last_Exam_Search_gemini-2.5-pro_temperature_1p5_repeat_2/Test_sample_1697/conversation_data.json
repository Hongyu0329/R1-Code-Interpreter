    "The reaction of N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide with sec-butyllithium (sec-BuLi) and tetramethylethylenediamine (TMEDA) in tetrahydrofuran (THF), followed by quenching with methyl iodide, results in the formation of **N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide**.\n\n### Reaction Analysis:\n\nThis two-step process is a classic example of a directed *ortho*-metalation (DoM) followed by an electrophilic quench.\n\n1.  **Directed *ortho*-Metalation:**\n    *   The starting material, N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide, possesses two functional groups capable of directing the metalation: the N,N-diethylamide group (-CONEt₂) and the dimethylamino group (-NMe₂).\n    *   In directed *ortho*-metalation reactions, a strong base, in this case, the highly reactive sec-BuLi/TMEDA complex, selectively removes a proton from the position *ortho* (adjacent) to a directing metalation group (DMG). The heteroatoms in the DMG coordinate to the lithium ion, directing the deprotonation to a nearby C-H bond.\n    *   The N,N-dialkylamide group is one of the most powerful DMGs available, significantly stronger than the dimethylamino group. The dimethylamino group is considered a moderate director.\n    *   The powerful amide group at position 1 directs metalation to the C2 and C6 positions. The amino group at position 3 directs to the C2 and C4 positions.\n    *   Since both groups direct to the C2 position, and this position is located between the two directors, the proton at C2 is particularly activated and will be preferentially removed. This is known as a synergistic directing effect. The sec-BuLi, a strong base suited for deprotonating weak carbon acids, accomplishes this deprotonation to form a nucleophilic aryllithium intermediate.\n\n2.  **Electrophilic Quench:**\n    *   The aryllithium species formed in the first step is a potent nucleophile.\n    *   When methyl iodide (CH₃I), an electrophile, is added to the reaction, the aryllithium attacks the methyl group, displacing the iodide ion.\n    *   This results in the substitution of the lithium atom at the C2 position with a methyl group.\n\nThe final product of this sequence is the methylation of the aromatic ring at the position between the two directing groups.\n\n<br>\n**Structure of the final product:**\n<br>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/3Z8z2Vn.png\" alt=\"Chemical structure of N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide\" width=\"400\"/>\n<br>\n\n<<<N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide>>>"
