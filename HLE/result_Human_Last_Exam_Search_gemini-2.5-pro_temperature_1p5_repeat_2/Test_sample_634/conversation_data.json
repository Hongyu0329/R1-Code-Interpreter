    "To find the greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of the two polynomial matrices P1 and P2, we can use the Euclidean algorithm adapted for matrices. This involves performing elementary row operations on a block matrix formed by P1 and P2 to reduce it to a simpler form. The resulting non-zero matrix at the end of the process will be the GCRD.\n\nThe given matrices are:\nP1 = [[s^2 + s, -s], [-s^2 - 1, s^2]]\nP2 = [[s, 0], [-s - 1, 1]]\n\nWe form the augmented matrix M by stacking P1 on top of P2:\nM = [[s^2 + s, -s],\n     [-s^2 - 1, s^2],\n     [s,          0],\n     [-s - 1,     1]]\n\nThe goal is to simplify this matrix using elementary row operations, where we can add a polynomial multiple of one row to another.\n\n1.  **Use the '1' in the last row for simplification.** We swap the first and fourth rows to bring the row with a constant '1' to the top.\n    M becomes:\n    [[-s - 1,  1],\n     [-s^2 - 1, s^2],\n     [s^2 + s, -s],\n     [s,       0]]\n\n2.  **Eliminate the second column entries.**\n    *   Add s^2 times the first row to the second row.\n    *   Add s times the first row to the third row.\n    The matrix transforms to:\n    [[-s - 1,      1],\n     [s^3 - 1,     0],\n     [0,           0],\n     [s,           0]]\n\n3.  **Simplify the rows with zero in the second column.** We now have two rows, [s^3 - 1, 0] and [s, 0]. We can apply the standard Euclidean algorithm for the polynomials `s^3 - 1` and `s`.\n    *   `s^3 - 1 = s^2 * (s) - 1`. The greatest common divisor (GCD) of `s^3 - 1` and `s` is 1.\n    *   This means we can perform row operations to obtain a row `[1, 0]`. Subtract `s^2` times the last row from the second row: `[s^3 - 1, 0] - s^2 * [s, 0] = [-1, 0]`.\n\n4.  **The matrix is now:**\n    [[-s - 1, 1],\n     [-1,     0],\n     [s,      0]]\n    (The zero row is removed).\n\n5.  **Further simplification.** Use the new second row `[-1, 0]` to eliminate other entries.\n    *   Add `s` times the second row to the third row: `[s, 0] + s * [-1, 0] = [0, 0]`.\n    *   Subtract `(s+1)` times the second row from the first row: `[-s - 1, 1] - (s+1) * [-1, 0] = [0, 1]`.\n\n6.  **Final Result.** After these operations, the matrix becomes:\n    [,\n     [-1, 0],\n    ]\n\nBy removing the zero row and reordering, we obtain the matrix `[[-1, 0], [0, 1]]`, which is unimodularly equivalent to the identity matrix `[[1, 0], [0, 1]]`.\n\nA GCRD that is equivalent to the identity matrix implies that the original matrices are \"right coprime\".\n\nTherefore, the greatest common right divisor of P1 and P2 is the identity matrix.\n\n<<<[,]>>>"
