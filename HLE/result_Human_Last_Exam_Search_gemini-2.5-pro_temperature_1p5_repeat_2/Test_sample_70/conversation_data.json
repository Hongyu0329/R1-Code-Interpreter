    "To determine which flags of African nations have the same linear algebraic rank as the flag of Denmark, we must first establish the rank of the Danish flag. When representing a flag as a matrix, numerical values are assigned to its colors. The problem states we should choose these values to maximize the rank.\n\nThe Danish flag consists of a red field with a white cross. When modeled as a matrix, it will have two types of linearly independent rows: rows representing the solid red portions of the flag and rows containing the white horizontal bar of the cross. Because these two types of rows are not scalar multiples of each other, they are linearly independent. This means the row space is spanned by two basis vectors, and therefore, the maximal rank of the Danish flag is 2.\n\nThe task is now to identify African flags with a maximal rank of 2. A flag's design dictates its rank:\n*   **Rank 1:** Flags with designs consisting solely of horizontal or vertical stripes have a rank of 1, as all row (or column) vectors are scalar multiples of a single vector.\n*   **Rank 2:** Flags whose designs are not simple parallel stripes but are not overly complex. This category includes flags with a simple emblem on a plain or striped background, designs with a canton (a distinct rectangle in the corner), or designs with intersecting vertical and horizontal bands. These features introduce a second linearly independent row or column.\n*   **Rank > 2:** Flags with more complex geometric features, such as diagonal stripes, triangles, or chevrons, tend to create multiple distinct, linearly independent row patterns, resulting in a rank greater than 2.\n\nBased on this classification, the following African nations have flags with a linear algebraic rank of 2, the same as the flag of Denmark:\n\n*   **Algeria:** The flag has vertical green and white bands with a central red star and crescent. This emblem disrupts the simple bicolor pattern, creating at least two linearly independent column vectors.\n*   **Angola:** A horizontal bicolor of red and black with a central emblem (a gear, machete, and star). The emblem ensures the flag is not composed of simple horizontal stripes.\n*   **Benin:** The design features a vertical green band at the hoist and two horizontal yellow and red bands on the fly side, creating two linearly independent column types.\n*   **Burkina Faso:** This flag is a horizontal bicolor of red and green with a yellow star in the center. The central star creates a second type of linearly independent row.\n*   **Cameroon:** A vertical tricolor of green, red, and yellow with a central yellow star. The star ensures the columns are not all simple scalar multiples.\n*   **Central African Republic:** This flag combines four horizontal stripes with an intersecting vertical red stripe. This combination of horizontal and vertical elements results in a rank of 2.\n*   **Egypt:** A horizontal tricolor of red, white, and black with the Eagle of Saladin emblem in the central white stripe.\n*   **Eswatini (formerly Swaziland):** Features horizontal bands of blue, yellow, and red, with a large traditional shield and spears in the center.\n*   **Ethiopia:** A horizontal tricolor of green, yellow, and red with the national emblem in the center.\n*   **Ghana:** This flag is a horizontal tricolor (red, yellow, green) with a black star in the middle stripe, making it a rank-2 design.\n*   **Guinea-Bissau:** A vertical red band with a black star on the hoist side and two horizontal bands (yellow and green) on the fly side.\n*   **Lesotho:** A horizontal tricolor of blue, white, and green with a black *mokorotlo* (Basotho hat) in the center.\n*   **Liberia:** The flag's eleven horizontal stripes are disrupted by a blue canton in the upper hoist corner, which creates rows that are not scalar multiples of the simple striped rows.\n*   **Libya:** A horizontal tricolor with a central white star and crescent in the wider middle black stripe.\n*   **Madagascar:** Similar to Benin's flag, it has a vertical white band at the hoist with horizontal red and green bands on the fly side.\n*   **Malawi:** A horizontal tricolor of black, red, and green with a red rising sun emblem in the top stripe.\n*   **Mauritania:** A green field with a central gold crescent and star, framed by red horizontal bands at the top and bottom.\n*   **Morocco:** A solid red field with a green pentagram (the Seal of Solomon) in the center.\n*   **Niger:** A horizontal tricolor of orange, white, and green with an orange circle in the center.\n*   **Rwanda:** Composed of horizontal stripes of blue, yellow, and green, with a sun emblem in the top-right corner.\n*   **Senegal:** A vertical tricolor of green, yellow, and red with a green star in the central stripe.\n*   **Somalia:** The flag has a light blue field with a single white five-pointed star in the center.\n*   **Togo:** Features five horizontal stripes with a red canton in the corner bearing a white star.\n*   **Uganda:** Six horizontal stripes are overlaid with a central white disk containing a grey crowned crane emblem.\n\n<<<Algeria, Angola, Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Egypt, Eswatini, Ethiopia, Ghana, Guinea-Bissau, Lesotho, Liberia, Libya, Madagascar, Malawi, Mauritania, Morocco, Niger, Rwanda, Senegal, Somalia, Togo, Uganda>>>"
