    "I have performed initial searches to understand the key concepts.\nFrom the search results, I have gathered the following:\n- A category consists of objects and morphisms (arrows) between them, satisfying certain properties like associativity of composition and existence of identity morphisms.\n- Two categories are isomorphic if there exists a functor between them that is bijective on both objects and morphisms. This means they have the same structure.\n- A category with two objects, say O1 and O2, will have four sets of morphisms: Hom(O1, O1), Hom(O2, O2), Hom(O1, O2), and Hom(O2, O1).\n- The total number of morphisms is the sum of the sizes of these four sets.\n- For a category with 2 objects and 4 morphisms, we must have identity morphisms for each object. Let's call them id1 for O1 and id2 for O2. This leaves 2 additional morphisms to be distributed among the four Hom-sets.\n\nThe initial searches have provided a foundational understanding but have not directly answered the question of how many such categories exist up to isomorphism. The next steps will need to be more focused on enumeration and classification. I need to figure out the possible structures these 4 morphisms can form while satisfying the category axioms.\n\nI will now update the plan to reflect a more detailed approach to enumerating these categories.\n\nUpdated plan:\nSystematically enumerate all possible distributions of the 4 morphisms (which include the two required identity morphisms) among the four Hom-sets (Hom(O1, O1), Hom(O2, O2), Hom(O1, O2), Hom(O2, O1)).\nFor each distribution, determine all possible valid composition rules that satisfy the category axioms (associativity and identity).\nFor each valid category structure found, check if it is isomorphic to any of the others already found.\nSearch for existing classifications or enumerations of small categories, particularly those with 2 objects, to verify the results.\nFinally, consolidate the distinct isomorphism classes of categories and provide the total count.The previous search results have not yielded a direct answer to the question. While they provide general information about small categories, isomorphisms, and the OEIS, they do not specifically enumerate categories with 2 objects and 4 morphisms. The search for \"enumeration of categories with 2 objects and 4 morphisms\" did not return a specific document with the answer. The OEIS sequence A000112 is for posets, which are a specific type of category, but not all categories are posets, so this is not the answer. The other results are too general.\n\nTherefore, the next steps need to be very methodical and involve manual enumeration and classification. I will break down the problem into smaller pieces, considering the possible distributions of the non-identity morphisms and then analyzing the composition rules for each case. I will then need to check for isomorphisms between the resulting categories. This appears to be a combinatorial problem that requires careful case-by-case analysis rather than a simple lookup.\n\nBecause of the combinatorial nature of this problem, I'm adjusting the plan to be more explicit about the case analysis. I will need to be very systematic to avoid missing any cases or double-counting. After generating the possible category structures, I'll need a clear way to determine if they are isomorphic.From the previous searches, it is clear that there is no readily available \"catalog\" that lists the number of categories for a given number of objects and morphisms. The search results provide a good theoretical understanding of what a category is, what it means for two categories to be isomorphic, and some examples of small categories. One of the search results mentions \"the walking isomorphism\" which has 2 objects and 4 morphisms. This provides one potential candidate category. However, to determine the total number, a systematic enumeration seems unavoidable.\n\nThe previous plan to \"Systematically enumerate all possible distributions of the 4 morphisms\" is the correct approach. I need to execute this plan carefully. I will have to consider all the ways to place the two non-identity morphisms and then, for each placement, determine the valid composition rules. Finally, I will have to identify and count the non-isomorphic categories among the ones I've constructed. This process is essentially a manual, case-by-case analysis.\n\nGiven the nature of the problem, further general searches are unlikely to yield a direct answer. I will now proceed with the enumeration and analysis based on the information I already have.\n\nFinal Plan:\n1.  Let the two objects be $O_1$ and $O_2$. Every category with two objects must have at least two identity morphisms, $id_1: O_1 \\to O_1$ and $id_2: O_2 \\to O_2$. This accounts for two of the four morphisms.\n2.  Let the two non-identity morphisms be $f$ and $g$. I will systematically list all possible assignments for the domain and codomain of $f$ and $g$.\n3.  For each assignment, I will determine the possible composition rules that satisfy the axioms of a category (associativity of composition and the identity laws). This involves defining the result of all possible compositions of non-identity morphisms.\n4.  After defining the composition rules for each case, I will have a list of potential categories.\n5.  I will then analyze this list and identify which of these categories are isomorphic to each other. Two categories are isomorphic if there is a functor that is a bijection on objects and morphisms, preserving the composition and identity structure.\n6.  Finally, I will count the number of non-isomorphic categories.\n\nI will now proceed with the execution of this plan. No further search queries are needed at this point.\n\nExecution of the plan:\n\nLet the objects be $A$ and $B$. The identity morphisms are $id_A: A \\to A$ and $id_B: B \\to B$. We have two additional non-identity morphisms, $f$ and $g$.\n\n**Case 1: Both non-identity morphisms are endomorphisms.**\n-  **1a: Both are endomorphisms on A.** So, $f, g: A \\to A$. The morphisms are $\\{id_A, id_B, f, g\\}$.\n    - Compositions: We need to define $f \\circ f$, $f \\circ g$, $g \\circ f$, and $g \\circ g$. Each of these must be a morphism from $A \\to A$, so they can be $id_A$, $f$, or $g$. There are many possibilities here, forming different monoids on the set $\\{id_A, f, g\\}$. However, we are looking for categories up to isomorphism. The set of endomorphisms on $A$ forms a monoid with 3 elements. The endomorphisms on B form a trivial monoid with 1 element. There are 7 non-isomorphic monoids of order 3. So, there are 7 categories of this type.\n-  **1b: One is an endomorphism on A, the other on B.** So, $f: A \\to A$ and $g: B \\to B$. The morphisms are $\\{id_A, id_B, f, g\\}$.\n    - Compositions: $f \\circ f$ must be in $\\{id_A, f\\}$, so $f \\circ f = id_A$ or $f \\circ f = f$. Similarly, $g \\circ g = id_B$ or $g \\circ g = g$. This gives $2 \\times 2 = 4$ possible categories.\n-  By symmetry (swapping A and B), the case where both are endomorphisms on B is isomorphic to 1a.\n\n**Case 2: One non-identity morphism is an endomorphism, the other is not.**\n- Let $f: A \\to A$ and $g: A \\to B$.\n    - Compositions: We must define $f \\circ f \\in \\{id_A, f\\}$. We must also define $g \\circ f: A \\to B$, so $g \\circ f = g$. Any other composition is not possible. This gives 2 categories.\n-  By symmetry, we have cases like $f: A \\to A$ and $g: B \\to A$, $f: B \\to B$ and $g: A \\to B$, and $f: B \\to B$ and $g: B \\to A$. These will lead to isomorphic categories.\n\n**Case 3: Neither non-identity morphism is an endomorphism.**\n-  **3a: $f: A \\to B$ and $g: B \\to A$.**\n    - Compositions: We must define $g \\circ f: A \\to A$ and $f \\circ g: B \\to B$.\n    - Subcase 3a-i: $g \\circ f = id_A$ and $f \\circ g = id_B$. This is the \"walking isomorphism\" category. This gives 1 category.\n    - Subcase 3a-ii: $g \\circ f = id_A$ and $f \\circ g \\neq id_B$. Then $f \\circ g$ must be an endomorphism on B, but there are none other than the identity. So if we had more morphisms this could be different, but here $f \\circ g = id_B$ is the only possibility if we have no non-identity endomorphisms. So this leads to the same category as 3a-i.\n    - Let's assume we can have $f \\circ g = \\text{something else}$. If we had a third non-identity endomorphism on B, say h, we could have $f \\circ g = h$. But we only have 4 morphisms in total. Let's reconsider. What if $f \\circ g$ is a new morphism? No, the set of morphisms is fixed at 4. So $g \\circ f \\in \\{id_A\\}$ and $f \\circ g \\in \\{id_B\\}$. The only non-trivial choice is $g \\circ f = id_A$ and $f \\circ g = id_B$. So 1 category here.\n- **3b: $f: A \\to B$ and $g: A \\to B$.**\n    - No compositions are possible besides with identities. This is essentially a graph with two parallel arrows. This forms a valid category. This is 1 category.\n- **3c: $f: A \\to B$ and $g: B \\to C$ where C is a third object - not possible as we only have two objects.** This case is not applicable.\n- **3d: $f, g$ form a chain: $f: A \\to B$ and no other non-identity arrow from B.** And no non-identity arrow from A to A. This is not possible, we need to place g. Let's be more systematic.\n\nLet's restart the enumeration with a more rigorous structure based on the hom-sets.\nLet the objects be 1, 2. The morphisms are $\\{id_1, id_2, f, g\\}$.\n$|\\text{Hom}(1,1)| + |\\text{Hom}(1,2)| + |\\text{Hom}(2,1)| + |\\text{Hom}(2,2)| = 4$.\nSince each hom-set containing an identity is non-empty, $|\\text{Hom}(1,1)| \\ge 1$ and $|\\text{Hom}(2,2)| \\ge 1$.\n\nThe sizes of the hom-sets $(|\\text{Hom}(1,1)|, |\\text{Hom}(1,2)|, |\\text{Hom}(2,1)|, |\\text{Hom}(2,2)|)$ for the 2 non-identity morphisms can be partitions of 2:\n- (2,0,0,0): Both $f,g \\in \\text{Hom}(1,1)$. The hom-sets sizes are (3,0,0,1) or (1,0,0,3) by symmetry. We need to classify 3-element monoids. There are 7 non-isomorphic monoids of order 3.\n- (1,1,0,0): $f \\in \\text{Hom}(1,1)$, $g \\in \\text{Hom}(1,2)$. Sizes are (2,1,0,1).\n    - Composition: $f \\circ f$ must be in $\\{id_1, f\\}$. $g \\circ f$ must be $g$. 2 possibilities.\n- (1,0,1,0): $f \\in \\text{Hom}(1,1)$, $g \\in \\text{Hom}(2,1)$. Sizes are (2,0,1,1).\n    - Composition: $f \\circ f \\in \\{id_1, f\\}$. $f \\circ g$ is not defined. $g \\circ id_2 = g$. This gives 2 categories.\n- (1,0,0,1): $f \\in \\text{Hom}(1,1)$, $g \\in \\text{Hom}(2,2)$. Sizes are (2,0,0,2).\n    - Compositions: $f\\circ f \\in \\{id_1, f\\}$ and $g \\circ g \\in \\{id_2, g\\}$. $2 \\times 2 = 4$ categories.\n- (0,2,0,0): $f,g \\in \\text{Hom}(1,2)$. Sizes are (1,2,0,1). No non-identity compositions possible. 1 category.\n- (0,1,1,0): $f \\in \\text{Hom}(1,2)$, $g \\in \\text{Hom}(2,1)$. Sizes are (1,1,1,1).\n    - Compositions: $g \\circ f \\in \\{id_1\\}$ and $f \\circ g \\in \\{id_2\\}$. So $g \\circ f = id_1$ and $f \\circ g = id_2$. This is the \"walking isomorphism\". 1 category. What if $g \\circ f = \\text{a non-identity endomorphism on 1}$? But there are none. What if one composition is identity and the other is not? Let $g \\circ f = id_1$. $f \\circ g$ must be an endomorphism on 2, so it has to be $id_2$. So this seems to be the only option.\n    What if $g \\circ f$ is not identity? For this we need endomorphisms. Let's reconsider. Maybe a non-identity endomorphism exists.\n    Let's refine the partitions based on the total number of morphisms in each hom-set:\n    - (3, 0, 0, 1) and (1, 0, 0, 3) - 7 categories (from monoids of order 3).\n    - (2, 1, 0, 1) and (1, 1, 0, 2) and (2, 0, 1, 1) and (1, 0, 1, 2) - Let's analyze (2,1,0,1). Hom(1,1)={id1, f}, Hom(1,2)={g}, Hom(2,1) empty, Hom(2,2)={id2}. $f \\circ f$ can be $id_1$ or $f$. $g \\circ f$ must be in Hom(1,2), so it must be g. This gives 2 categories. All four configurations are isomorphic, so 2 categories here.\n    - (2, 0, 0, 2) - Hom(1,1)={id1, f}, Hom(2,2)={id2, g}. $f\\circ f \\in \\{id_1,f\\}$, $g\\circ g \\in \\{id_2,g\\}$. $2 \\times 2=4$ categories.\n    - (1, 2, 0, 1) and (1, 0, 2, 1) - Let's analyze (1,2,0,1). Hom(1,1)={id1}, Hom(1,2)={f,g}, Hom(2,1) empty, Hom(2,2)={id2}. No compositions possible. This is a single category. By symmetry (reversing arrows), (1,0,2,1) gives an isomorphic category. So 1 category.\n    - (1, 1, 1, 1) - Hom(1,2)={f}, Hom(2,1)={g}. Compositions $g \\circ f \\in Hom(1,1) = \\{id_1\\}$, and $f \\circ g \\in Hom(2,2)=\\{id_2\\}$. So $g \\circ f = id_1$ and $f \\circ g = id_2$. This is the groupoid with two elements, also known as \"the walking isomorphism\". 1 category.\n    - (1, 1, 2, 0) - not possible as Hom(2,2) must have id2.\n    - We are missing the case where we have a chain. For instance, Hom(1,2)={f} and Hom(2,1) is empty, but maybe Hom(1,1) has a non-identity. No, this was covered.\n\nLet's try a different approach. List known categories with 2 objects and see if they fit.\n1. The discrete category with 2 objects. This has 2 morphisms. Not 4.\n2. The category with two objects and a single non-identity arrow between them (and no other non-identity arrows). This has 3 morphisms.\n3. The \"walking isomorphism\" is a groupoid with two objects, with an isomorphism $f: A \\to B$ and its inverse $g: B \\to A$. Morphisms are $\\{id_A, id_B, f, g\\}$. Compositions are $f \\circ g = id_B$ and $g \\circ f = id_A$. This is one category with 2 objects and 4 morphisms.\n4. The parallel arrows category. Two objects A and B, and two parallel morphisms $f,g: A \\to B$. Morphisms are $\\{id_A, id_B, f, g\\}$. No non-trivial compositions. This is another category.\n5. The category with two objects A and B, and a morphism $f: A \\to B$ and a morphism $g: B \\to A$ such that $g \\circ f = id_A$ but $f \\circ g \\ne id_B$. For this to happen, $f \\circ g$ must be an endomorphism on B. But since we only have 4 morphisms in total and two are identities, there are no non-identity endomorphisms available. This case is not possible with only 4 morphisms.\n6. A category where the two objects are not isomorphic.\n    - Let objects be A, B. Hom(A,A)={idA}, Hom(B,B)={idB, g}, with $g \\circ g = g$. Let there also be a morphism $f: A \\to B$. To have 4 morphisms, that's it. Compositions: $g \\circ f: A \\to B$. So we must have $g \\circ f = f$. This is one category.\n    - Same as above but $g \\circ g = id_B$. Then $g \\circ f = f$. Another category.\n7. The two objects are discrete, but one has a non-identity endomorphism. E.g., Hom(A,A)={idA, f, g}, Hom(B,B)={idB}. Total morphisms is 4. The compositions on {idA, f, g} form a 3-element monoid. There are 7 such non-isomorphic monoids. So this gives 7 categories.\n8. Two non-identity endomorphisms, one on each object. Hom(A,A)={idA,f}, Hom(B,B)={idB,g}. Compositions are $f \\circ f$ and $g \\circ g$. Four cases:\n   - $f \\circ f = f$, $g \\circ g = g$.\n   - $f \\circ f = f$, $g \\circ g = id_B$.\n   - $f \\circ f = id_A$, $g \\circ g = g$.\n   - $f \\circ f = id_A$, $g \\circ g = id_B$.\n   These are 4 distinct categories.\n\nLet's summarize the list of non-isomorphic categories found so far:\n1. \"The walking isomorphism\" (a groupoid). (1 category)\n2. Two parallel arrows from A to B (no compositions). (1 category)\n3. A preorder with one arrow from A to B, and one from B to A (so A and B are equivalent), but it is not a groupoid. This is not possible with only 4 morphisms, as seen above.\n4. Two separate, non-trivial monoids on each object are not possible with only 4 morphisms in total.\n5. A trivial monoid on B, and a 3-element monoid on A. There are 7 such non-isomorphic monoids, which gives 7 categories.\n6. A 2-element monoid on A and a 2-element monoid on B. We have two choices for the composition in each monoid ($f^2=f$ or $f^2=id$). This gives $2 \\times 2 = 4$ categories.\n7. A single arrow $f: A \\to B$ and an endomorphism $g: B \\to B$.\n   - $g \\circ g = g$. Then $g \\circ f$ must be $f$. (1 category)\n   - $g \\circ g = id_B$. Then $g \\circ f$ must be $f$. (1 category)\n8. A single arrow $f: B \\to A$ and an endomorphism $g: B \\to B$. (Isomorphic to the previous case by reversing the non-endo arrow).\n9. A single arrow $f: A \\to B$ and an endomorphism $g: A \\to A$.\n   - $g \\circ g = g$. Then $f \\circ g$ must be $f$. (1 category)\n   - $g \\circ g = id_A$. Then $f \\circ g$ must be $f$. (1 category)\n10. A single arrow $f: B \\to A$ and an endomorphism $g: A \\to A$. (Isomorphic to the previous case).\n\nSo far the count is:\n1 (walking isomorphism) + 1 (parallel arrows) + 7 (3-element monoid on one object) + 4 (two 2-element monoids) + 2 (arrow and endo on codomain) + 2 (arrow and endo on domain) = 17.\n\nLet's double-check the isomorphisms between cases.\n- A category with a non-trivial endomorphism on only one object (case 5, 7 categories) cannot be isomorphic to one with non-trivial endomorphisms on both (case 6, 4 categories), or with no endomorphisms (cases 1, 2).\n- The walking isomorphism (case 1) and parallel arrows (case 2) are not isomorphic as one is a groupoid and the other is not.\n- Case 7 (arrow $A \\to B$ and endo on B) is not isomorphic to Case 9 (arrow $A \\to B$ and endo on A). The pattern of morphisms is different. In case 7 we have Hom(B,B) has size 2, in case 9 Hom(A,A) has size 2. A functor must preserve this. If the objects are swapped, then the direction of the arrow f changes. So we need to consider if F maps A to B and B to A.\n\nLet's consider two categories from case 7 and 9. C7 has sizes (1,1,0,2). C9 has sizes (2,1,0,1). They can't be isomorphic if the functor maps A to A and B to B. If F maps A to B and B to A, then F would map Hom_C9(A,A) to Hom_C7(B,B), and Hom_C9(A,B) to Hom_C7(B,A), etc. This would map (2,1,0,1) to (1,0,1,2). The target sizes are (1,1,0,2). They do not match. So case 7 and case 9 are distinct.\n\nThis gives:\n1 (walking iso)\n1 (parallel arrows A->B)\n1 (parallel arrows B->A - isomorphic to above, so no new one)\n1 (A->B and B->A, but not iso, compositions are zero, which means we have endomorphisms f.g=f, g.f=g. Need to re-examine this) Let's assume a zero morphism if composition is not one of the existing ones - this adds more morphisms. The question assumes exactly 4.\n\nLet's revisit the case of $f: A \\to B, g: B \\to A$.\n$g \\circ f: A \\to A$ must be $id_A$.\n$f \\circ g: B \\to B$ must be $id_B$.\nThis gives the walking isomorphism.\n\nWhat if we have two non-identity morphisms $f:A \\to B$ and $g:A \\to A$? This is case 9. Hom-set sizes (2,1,0,1).\n$g \\circ g \\in \\{id_A, g\\}$. This gives two categories.\n- $g \\circ g = g$.\n- $g \\circ g = id_A$.\n$f \\circ g \\in \\{f\\}$. So this composition is fixed.\n\nBy symmetry (reversing the roles of A and B), we have two more categories where $f:B \\to A$ and $g:B \\to B$. Hom-set sizes (1,0,1,2). These are not isomorphic to the previous two.\n\nTotal so far:\n1. Walking Isomorphism (groupoid): Hom-set sizes (1,1,1,1)\n2. Parallel arrows $A \\to B$: Hom-set sizes (1,2,0,1)\n3. Parallel arrows $B \\to A$: Hom-set sizes (1,0,2,1)\n4. A to B to A chain: $f: A \\to B$, $g: B \\to A$. $g \\circ f=id_A$, $f \\circ g$ is not defined (no endo on B). This is not right. $f \\circ g \\in Hom(B,B)=\\{id_B\\}$, so it must be $id_B$. Back to walking iso.\n5. Endomorphisms only:\n   - On one object: A 3-element monoid on A, trivial on B. Sizes (3,0,0,1). 7 categories. Isomorphic to the case with the monoid on B.\n   - On both objects: A 2-element monoid on each. Sizes (2,0,0,2). $2 \\times 2 = 4$ categories.\n6. Mixed morphisms:\n   - $f: A \\to B$, $g:A \\to A$. Sizes (2,1,0,1). Two categories based on $g \\circ g$.\n   - $f: B \\to A$, $g:A \\to A$. Sizes (2,0,1,1). Isomorphic to previous.\n   - $f: A \\to B$, $g:B \\to B$. Sizes (1,1,0,2). Two categories based on $g \\circ g$.\n   - $f: B \\to A$, $g:B \\to B$. Sizes (1,0,1,2). Isomorphic to previous.\n\nLet's recount, checking for isomorphisms more carefully.\nLet's label categories by their hom-set size vectors $(|H(A,A)|, |H(A,B)|, |H(B,A)|, |H(B,B)|)$.\n1. (1,1,1,1) -> Walking isomorphism. 1 cat.\n2. (1,2,0,1) -> Parallel arrows from A to B. 1 cat.\n3. (1,0,2,1) -> Parallel arrows from B to A. 1 cat.\n4. (3,0,0,1) -> A 3-element monoid on A. 7 cats.\n5. (1,0,0,3) -> A 3-element monoid on B. Isomorphic to case 4. So no new ones.\n6. (2,0,0,2) -> A 2-element monoid on each object. 4 cats.\n7. (2,1,0,1) -> Endo on A, arrow A to B. 2 cats.\n8. (1,1,0,2) -> Endo on B, arrow A to B. 2 cats.\n9. (2,0,1,1) -> Endo on A, arrow B to A. 2 cats.\n10. (1,0,1,2) -> Endo on B, arrow B to A. 2 cats.\n\nNow check for isomorphisms between these sets of categories.\n- An isomorphism of categories is a bijective functor F. If F maps A->A and B->B, then hom-set sizes must match. If F maps A->B and B->A, the tuple of sizes gets swapped.\n- Are (1,2,0,1) and (1,0,2,1) isomorphic? Yes, by swapping the labels of the objects. So this is 1 class of categories. (Parallel arrows).\n- Are (2,1,0,1) and (1,0,1,2) isomorphic? Let C1 be from (2,1,0,1) and C2 from (1,0,1,2). A functor F:C1->C2 mapping A->B, B->A would require sizes of Hom(A,A) in C1 to match Hom(B,B) in C2 (size 2), Hom(A,B) in C1 to match Hom(B,A) in C2 (size 1), Hom(B,A) in C1 to match Hom(A,B) in C2 (size 0, but C2 has size 1, so not isomorphic), and Hom(B,B) in C1 to match Hom(A,A) in C2 (size 1). So (2,1,0,1) -> (1,1,0,2) upon swapping, which doesn't match the original.  Wait, if $F$ maps $A \\to B'$ and $B \\to A'$, then $F: \\text{Hom}_C(A,B) \\to \\text{Hom}_{C'}(B',A')$. So the vector $(|H(A,A)|, |H(A,B)|, |H(B,A)|, |H(B,B)|)$ for C would correspond to $(|H(B',B')|, |H(B',A')|, |H(A',B')|, |H(A',A')|)$ for C'. This is $(s_4, s_3, s_2, s_1)$. So we must check if the reversed vector is in our list.\n- (2,1,0,1) reverses to (1,0,1,2). So the 2 cats from (2,1,0,1) are isomorphic to the 2 cats from (1,0,1,2) with objects swapped. So only 2 distinct classes.\n- (2,0,1,1) reverses to (1,1,0,2). So the 2 cats from (2,0,1,1) are isomorphic to the 2 cats from (1,1,0,2) with objects swapped. So only 2 distinct classes.\n\nMy set of distinct classes so far, with their size vectors and counts:\n1. (1,1,1,1) - groupoid: 1\n2. (1,2,0,1) and its reverse (1,0,2,1) - parallel arrows: 1\n3. (3,0,0,1) and its reverse (1,0,0,3) - 3-element monoid on one object: 7\n4. (2,0,0,2) - self-reverse - 2-element monoid on each: 4\n5. (2,1,0,1) and its reverse (1,0,1,2) - endo on A, arrow A->B: 2\n6. (1,1,0,2) and its reverse (2,0,1,1) - endo on B, arrow A->B: 2\n\nTotal: 1 + 1 + 7 + 4 + 2 + 2 = 17.\n\nThere is also the case of a category from a poset. A poset on 2 elements can be discrete (2 morphisms, not 4), a linear order (3 morphisms, not 4), or have two incomparable elements (2 morphisms). So no posets have 4 morphisms with 2 objects.\n\nA paper by V.A. Tsalenko mentions the classification of small categories, but it is not readily accessible. Another source mentions that for 2 objects and n morphisms, the number of categories is known for small n.\n\nLet's check my logic again. It's easy to miss a case or mis-classify isomorphisms.\nThe paper \"Enumeration of finite categories\" by G. Longo and E. Moggi seems relevant but isn't providing a direct number. A different paper by Allouch and Simpson gives counts for categories associated with matrices of 2s, which is a very specific case.\n\nA key insight might be from a math stackexchange answer: \"there is a category (the walking isomorphism) with two objects and an isomorphism between them, {a↔b}. It has exactly 4 morphisms.\" This is my case 1.\n\nAnother post talks about the \"interval category\" also called \"the walking arrow\". This has two objects, 0 and 1, and one non-identity morphism $0 \\to 1$. Total of 3 morphisms. Not 4.\n\nMy enumeration of hom-set size distributions seems solid. The analysis of each case:\n- For endomorphism-only categories, the number is the number of non-isomorphic monoids of the given sizes, which is well-established. So 7 and 4 seem correct.\n- For the other cases, I'm defining the composition rules. Let's re-verify the \"mixed\" cases.\n  - (2,1,0,1): $H(A,A) = \\{id_A, g\\}$, $H(A,B)=\\{f\\}$. Composition $f \\circ g$ must be in $H(A,B)$, so $f \\circ g = f$. Composition $g \\circ f$ is not defined. $g \\circ g$ can be $id_A$ or $g$. So 2 categories.\n  - (1,1,0,2): $H(A,B) = \\{f\\}$, $H(B,B) = \\{id_B, g\\}$. Composition $g \\circ f$ must be in $H(A,B)$, so $g \\circ f = f$. Composition $f \\circ g$ is not defined. $g \\circ g$ can be $id_B$ or $g$. So 2 categories.\nThese seem correct.\n\nThe total is 17. Is it possible there are more complex composition rules I missed? For instance, in the (3,0,0,1) case, where Hom(A,A) = {id_A, f, g}. The compositions are not just $f \\circ f$ etc, but also $f \\circ g$, $g \\circ f$. This is why the number of non-isomorphic monoids of order 3 is used. It is indeed 7.\n\nSo, the reasoning seems to hold. The number appears to be 17. There are also online resources that allow computational enumeration of small structures. I will do a final search for such a tool or a direct confirmation of this number.I have performed a thorough manual enumeration and classification of categories with 2 objects and 4 morphisms. The process involved:\n1.  Identifying that any such category must have two identity morphisms, leaving two non-identity morphisms to be placed.\n2.  Systematically considering all possible distributions of these two non-identity morphisms into the four possible Hom-sets: Hom(A,A), Hom(B,B), Hom(A,B), and Hom(B,A).\n3.  For each distribution, determining the possible valid composition rules consistent with the axioms of category theory.\n4.  Grouping the resulting categories by the sizes of their Hom-sets, which is an invariant under isomorphism.\n5.  Analyzing each group for internal isomorphisms and isomorphisms with other groups by considering functors that swap the objects.\n6.  The detailed case-by-case analysis yielded a total of 17 non-isomorphic categories.\n\nThe final search did not provide a direct numerical answer from an online encyclopedia or a specific paper, but the mention of \"the walking isomorphism\" as a category with 2 objects and 4 morphisms provided a concrete example that was also found in my enumeration. This gives some confidence in the manual process. The problem seems to be one of combinatorial construction rather than a simple lookup.\n\nMy enumeration, which breaks the problem down by the structure of the endomorphism monoids and the connections between the objects, appears to be exhaustive.\n\nThe final list of non-isomorphic categories is:\n*   The groupoid where the two objects are isomorphic (the \"walking isomorphism\").\n*   The category with two parallel arrows from one object to another.\n*   Categories where all non-identity morphisms are endomorphisms of one object (isomorphic to a 3-element monoid on one object and a trivial monoid on the other). There are 7 such non-isomorphic monoids.\n*   Categories with one non-identity endomorphism on each of the two objects. There are 4 such categories, depending on whether the endomorphisms are idempotent or compose to the identity.\n*   Categories with one endomorphism and one morphism between the two objects. This leads to 4 more distinct categories (2 where the arrow goes from the object with the endomorphism, and 2 where it goes to it).\n\nSumming these up: 1 (groupoid) + 1 (parallel arrows) + 7 (3-element monoid) + 4 (two 2-element monoids) + 4 (mixed case) = 17.  Ah, I recounted the mixed case and it should be 4, not 2+2, because the isomorphism check A->B vs B->A needs to be done carefully.\n\nLet's recheck the isomorphism for the mixed cases.\n- Case A: Hom-set sizes (2,1,0,1). $g:A \\to A$, $f: A \\to B$. Two categories depending on $g^2$.\n- Case B: Hom-set sizes (1,1,0,2). $g:B \\to B$, $f: A \\to B$. Two categories depending on $g^2$.\n- Case C: Hom-set sizes (2,0,1,1). $g:A \\to A$, $f: B \\to A$. Two categories.\n- Case D: Hom-set sizes (1,0,1,2). $g:B \\to B$, $f: B \\to A$. Two categories.\n\nAre A and B isomorphic? Let's take $C_A$ from case A. Its size vector is (2,1,0,1). For an isomorphism to $C_B$ with size vector (1,1,0,2), we must swap objects. The swapped vector for $C_A$ is (1,0,1,2). This is the vector for case D, not B. So A is isomorphic to D.\nAre B and C isomorphic? $C_B$ vector is (1,1,0,2). Swapped it's (2,0,1,1), which is case C.\nSo we have two pairs of isomorphic sets of categories. (A is isomorphic to D, and B is isomorphic to C).\nThus, the total number of non-isomorphic categories from these mixed cases is 2 (from A/D) + 2 (from B/C) = 4.\n\nSo the final count remains:\n1 (walking isomorphism)\n1 (parallel arrows)\n7 (3-element monoid on one object)\n4 (2-element monoids on each object)\n4 (mixed cases as explained above)\nTotal = 1 + 1 + 7 + 4 + 4 = 17.\n\nThe reasoning seems to hold up after re-verification.\n\nFinal Answer should be 17.\nI have systematically enumerated all possibilities and checked for isomorphisms. The problem breaks down into analyzing the structure of endomorphism monoids and the connecting morphisms, and the number of non-isomorphic monoids is a known result. The analysis of how these structures can be combined and whether the resulting categories are isomorphic appears to cover all cases without double counting.\n\nTherefore, I am confident in the result of 17.There are 17 categories with 2 objects and 4 morphisms, up to isomorphism.\n\nLet the two objects be $O_1$ and $O_2$. Any category with two objects must have at least two identity morphisms, $id_1: O_1 \\to O_1$ and $id_2: O_2 \\to O_2$. This leaves two non-identity morphisms, let's call them $f$ and $g$. The structure of the category is determined by the domains and codomains of $f$ and $g$, and by the rules of composition.\n\nThe classification of these categories can be broken down into cases based on the distribution of the two non-identity morphisms among the four possible Hom-sets: $\\text{Hom}(O_1, O_1)$, $\\text{Hom}(O_2, O_2)$, $\\text{Hom}(O_1, O_2)$, and $\\text{Hom}(O_2, O_1)$. An isomorphism of categories requires a functor that is a bijection on both objects and morphisms, which means the sizes of these Hom-sets are important invariants to consider.\n\nA systematic enumeration leads to the following non-isomorphic categories:\n\n1.  **The \"Walking Isomorphism\":** This is a category where the two objects are isomorphic. It consists of the two identity morphisms and two morphisms $f: O_1 \\to O_2$ and $g: O_2 \\to O_1$ which are inverses of each other ($g \\circ f = id_1$ and $f \\circ g = id_2$). This forms a groupoid and accounts for **1** category.\n\n2.  **Parallel Morphisms:** This category has two parallel non-identity morphisms from one object to another, for example, $f: O_1 \\to O_2$ and $g: O_1 \\to O_2$. There are no possible non-trivial compositions to define. The case with two parallel morphisms from $O_2$ to $O_1$ is isomorphic. This gives **1** category.\n\n3.  **Endomorphisms on a Single Object:** In this case, both non-identity morphisms are endomorphisms of the same object, for instance, $f, g: O_1 \\to O_1$. The set of endomorphisms on $O_1$, $\\{id_1, f, g\\}$, must form a 3-element monoid. The number of non-isomorphic monoids of order 3 is 7. Each of these defines a distinct category where the other object, $O_2$, only has its identity morphism. This accounts for **7** categories.\n\n4.  **Endomorphisms on Both Objects:** Here, there is one non-identity endomorphism on each object, $f: O_1 \\to O_1$ and $g: O_2 \\to O_2$. The composition rules are determined by $f \\circ f$ and $g \\circ g$. Each of these compositions can either be the respective identity morphism or the morphism itself. This gives $2 \\times 2 = 4$ possible non-isomorphic categories.\n\n5.  **Mixed Morphisms:** These categories have one endomorphism and one morphism between the two objects. A careful analysis of the possible domains and codomains and the resulting compositions, while accounting for isomorphisms (such as by swapping the objects), reveals **4** more distinct categories. These are:\n    *   An endomorphism on $O_1$ and a morphism from $O_1$ to $O_2$ (2 categories, based on the composition of the endomorphism with itself).\n    *   An endomorphism on $O_2$ and a morphism from $O_1$ to $O_2$ (2 categories, based on the composition of the endomorphism with itself).\n\nIn total, the number of non-isomorphic categories with 2 objects and 4 morphisms is $1 + 1 + 7 + 4 + 4 = 17$.\n\n<<<17>>>"
