    "While the Aeneid mentions numerous bodies of water, both real and mythological, identifying the three longest terrestrial rivers requires a review of their actual geographical lengths. Based on historical and geographical data, the three longest rivers mentioned in Virgil's epic poem are the Rh么ne, the Tiber, and the Volturnus.\n\nThe longest of these is the **Rh么ne River**, with a length of 812 kilometers (505 miles). It flows through Switzerland and France, emptying into the Mediterranean Sea.\n\nThe second longest is the **Tiber River**, the main watercourse of Rome, which runs for 406 kilometers (252 miles) through central Italy before reaching the Tyrrhenian Sea. The Tiber holds significant historical and geographical importance in the narrative of the Aeneid.\n\nThe third longest is the **Volturnus River** (modern Volturno), located in south-central Italy, with a length of 175 kilometers (109 miles).\n\nOther notable rivers mentioned in the Aeneid include the Aufidus (modern Ofanto) at approximately 170 kilometers, the Metaurus at 121 kilometers, and the Rubicon, which is about 80 kilometers long. The epic also references mythological rivers such as the Eridanus, whose geological namesake was an ancient river of immense length, and underworld rivers like the Styx and Acheron. However, focusing on the terrestrial rivers with established lengths, the Rh么ne, Tiber, and Volturnus are the most substantial.\n\n<<<The three longest rivers mentioned in the Aeneid are the Rh么ne, the Tiber, and the Volturnus.>>>"
