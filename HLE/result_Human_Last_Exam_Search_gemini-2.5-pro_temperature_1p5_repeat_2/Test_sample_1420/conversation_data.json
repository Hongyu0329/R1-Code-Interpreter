    "In the framework of renormalization group theory, the scaling exponent α for the specific heat of a system is determined using the epsilon (ϵ) expansion. This method calculates critical exponents as a power series in the parameter `ϵ = d_c - d`, where `d_c` is the upper critical dimension and `d` is the spatial dimension of the system.\n\nFor a broad class of systems, including those in the same universality class as the O(N) model (such as the Ising model), the upper critical dimension is `d_c = 4`. The specific heat, C, is expected to diverge near the critical temperature, T_c, following the power law `C ∝ |T - T_c|⁻ᵃ`.\n\nThe problem specifies a spatial dimension `d=3`, which means the expansion parameter is `ϵ = 4 - 3 = 1`.\n\nThe epsilon expansion for the specific heat exponent α for an O(N)-symmetric model is given to second order as:\n\n`α = (4 - N) / (2(N+8)) * ϵ - (N+2)² * (N+28) / (4(N+8)³) * ϵ² + O(ϵ³)`\n\nHere, N represents the number of components of the order parameter. For the common case of a system in the Ising universality class (e.g., a simple uniaxial magnet or a liquid-gas transition), N=1.\n\nSubstituting N=1 and ϵ=1 into the formula, we can calculate the value for α:\n\n**First-order approximation:**\nPlugging in N=1 and ϵ=1 into the first term:\n`α ≈ (4 - 1) / (2(1+8)) * 1`\n`α ≈ 3 / 18`\n`α ≈ 1/6 ≈ 0.167`\n\n**Second-order approximation:**\nIncluding the second-order term provides a more refined estimate:\n`α ≈ (1/6) - (1+2)² * (1+28) / (4(1+8)³) * 1²`\n`α ≈ (1/6) - (9 * 29) / (4 * 729)`\n`α ≈ (1/6) - 261 / 2916`\n`α ≈ (1/6) - 29 / 324`\n`α ≈ 0.1667 - 0.0895`\n`α ≈ 0.0772`\n\nThe first-order epsilon expansion gives a value of α ≈ 1/6. Including the second-order correction adjusts this value to approximately 0.077. For comparison, more advanced techniques and numerical simulations for the 3D Ising model place the value of α at approximately 0.110. The epsilon expansion provides a systematic, albeit approximate, way to calculate these exponents away from the upper critical dimension.\n\nTo the first order in the epsilon expansion, the scaling exponent is 1/6.\n\n<<<1/6>>>"
