    "**San José Mogote, Oaxaca, Mexico –** The earliest known date recorded by a pre-Columbian civilization in the Americas using an aboriginal writing system is **\"1 Earthquake,\"** which corresponds to a day in the 260-day ritual calendar. This glyph is carved on Monument 3, a stone monument discovered at the Zapotec site of San José Mogote. Archaeological evidence dates the monument to the Rosario phase, between **600 and 500 BCE**.\n\nThe monument depicts a slain and bloodied captive, believed to be a sacrificed war prisoner. The \"1 Earthquake\" glyph is located between the figure's legs and is widely considered by scholars to be a calendrical notation. There is some debate as to whether the glyph represents the personal name of the individual, which would have been their birthdate in accordance with Zapotec custom, or the date on which they were sacrificed. Regardless of its specific function as a name or an event marker, it stands as the first documented use of the 260-day calendar and the earliest recorded date in a Mesoamerican writing system.\n\nOther early examples of dated inscriptions in the Americas are notably later. For instance, the earliest securely dated evidence of the Maya calendar is the \"7 Deer\" glyph found on mural fragments in San Bartolo, Guatemala, which date to between 300 and 200 BCE. The Olmec civilization also has evidence of an early writing system around 650 BCE, with some artifacts bearing glyphs that may represent dates, but this interpretation is not as certain as the Zapotec example.\n\nThe well-known Long Count calendar, used by the Maya and other Mesoamerican cultures, appears even later. The earliest confirmed Long Count date is found on Stela 2 from Chiapa de Corzo, Mexico, and corresponds to **36 BCE**. Another early Long Count date is on Stela C from Tres Zapotes, dating to 32 BCE.\n\nTherefore, the Zapotec glyph \"1 Earthquake\" from San José Mogote predates other recorded dates by several centuries, marking a pivotal moment in the intellectual and cultural development of the ancient Americas.\n\n<<<1 Earthquake>>>"
