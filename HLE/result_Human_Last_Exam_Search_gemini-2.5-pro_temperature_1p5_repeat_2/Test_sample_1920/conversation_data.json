    "To find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters $\\chi$ of conductor $d=53599$ and order 6, we follow these steps:\n\n**1. Factorize the conductor $d$**\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of the conductor $d = 53599$.\nThrough calculation, we find that $d = 7 \\times 13 \\times 19 \\times 31$.\nThe conductor is a product of distinct odd primes. Let $d = p_1 p_2 p_3 p_4$, where $p_1=7$, $p_2=13$, $p_3=19$, and $p_4=31$.\n\n**2. Structure of Primitive Characters**\nA Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $d$ is primitive if and only if it can be written as a product of primitive characters $\\chi_i$ modulo each prime factor $p_i$ of the conductor.\nSo, $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\chi_3 \\chi_4$, where each $\\chi_i$ is a primitive character modulo $p_i$.\nThe order of $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of the component characters: $\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_1), \\text{ord}(\\chi_2), \\text{ord}(\\chi_3), \\text{ord}(\\chi_4))$.\n\n**3. Orders of Component Characters**\nWe need the order of $\\chi$ to be 6. This requires that for each $\\chi_i$, its order must be a divisor of 6. Also, at least one $\\chi_i$ must have an order divisible by 2, and at least one must have an order divisible by 3.\n\nFor a prime $p$, the group of primitive characters modulo $p$ is cyclic of order $\\phi(p) = p-1$. The number of primitive characters of order $k$ is $\\phi(k)$, provided that $k$ divides $p-1$.\n\nLet's check the values of $p_i-1$ for our prime factors:\n*   $p_1 - 1 = 7 - 1 = 6$\n*   $p_2 - 1 = 13 - 1 = 12$\n*   $p_3 - 1 = 19 - 1 = 18$\n*   $p_4 - 1 = 31 - 1 = 30$\n\nFor each prime factor $p_i$, $p_i-1$ is divisible by 6. Therefore, for each $p_i$, there exist primitive characters of orders 1, 2, 3, and 6. The number of characters for each order $k$ is given by Euler's totient function, $\\phi(k)$:\n*   Number of characters of order 1: $\\phi(1) = 1$\n*   Number of characters of order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$\n*   Number of characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$\n*   Number of characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$\n\n**4. Counting the Characters using Inclusion-Exclusion**\n\nWe want to find the number of tuples of characters $(\\chi_1, \\chi_2, \\chi_3, \\chi_4)$ such that $\\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_1), \\text{ord}(\\chi_2), \\text{ord}(\\chi_3), \\text{ord}(\\chi_4)) = 6$.\nWe can solve this using the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion.\n\nLet $S_k$ be the set of characters $\\chi = \\chi_1\\chi_2\\chi_3\\chi_4$ where the order of each $\\chi_i$ divides $k$. The total number of such characters is $|S_k|$. The number of choices for each $\\chi_i$ is the sum of $\\phi(j)$ for all $j$ that divide $k$. By Gauss's identity, this sum is equal to $k$.\n\n*   Let $N_6$ be the number of characters where the order of each component $\\chi_i$ divides 6. For each component, there are $\\phi(1)+\\phi(2)+\\phi(3)+\\phi(6) = 1+1+2+2 = 6$ choices.\n    $N_6 = 6 \\times 6 \\times 6 \\times 6 = 6^4 = 1296$.\n\n*   Let $N_3$ be the number of characters where the order of each component $\\chi_i$ divides 3 (i.e., the orders are from the set {1, 3}). This means the lcm of the orders will not have a factor of 2. For each component, there are $\\phi(1)+\\phi(3) = 1+2 = 3$ choices.\n    $N_3 = 3 \\times 3 \\times 3 \\times 3 = 3^4 = 81$.\n\n*   Let $N_2$ be the number of characters where the order of each component $\\chi_i$ divides 2 (i.e., the orders are from the set {1, 2}). This means the lcm of the orders will not have a factor of 3. For each component, there are $\\phi(1)+\\phi(2) = 1+1 = 2$ choices.\n    $N_2 = 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 2^4 = 16$.\n\n*   Let $N_1$ be the number of characters where the order of each component $\\chi_i$ divides 1 (i.e., the order is 1). This corresponds to the intersection of the two sets above. For each component, there is $\\phi(1) = 1$ choice.\n    $N_1 = 1 \\times 1 \\times 1 \\times 1 = 1^4 = 1$.\n\nThe number of characters with order exactly 6 is given by:\nNumber = $N_6 - N_3 - N_2 + N_1$\nNumber = $1296 - 81 - 16 + 1 = 1200$.\n\n<<<1200>>>"
