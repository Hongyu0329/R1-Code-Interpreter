The clearance of amyloid by macrophages is not facilitated by the breakdown of a single shielding protein. Instead, it is a complex process involving multiple factors. A key aspect is the enzymatic degradation of the **amyloid-β (Aβ) protein** itself by enzymes such as neprilysin and angiotensin-converting enzyme, which can be expressed by macrophages. Additionally, certain proteins like **LRPAP1** and **C1q** can inhibit macrophage engulfment of amyloid; their presence hinders clearance, and their absence or inhibition would promote it. Therefore, the process is more about the active degradation of Aβ and overcoming inhibitory signals rather than breaking down a protective shield.
