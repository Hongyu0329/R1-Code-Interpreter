    "My methodical breakdown of the problem into syntactic structures of length 5 appears sound. The search results confirm that counting boolean expressions is a known, complex problem, often related to Catalan numbers or requiring recursive solutions (dynamic programming) for more general cases. For a fixed, small length like 5, a direct enumeration of the valid syntactic forms is a feasible approach. My detailed casework seems to cover all possibilities without overlap, assuming that any syntactically valid string of 5 symbols counts as a distinct expression.\n\nI will re-verify my calculations for each case one final time before presenting the answer.\n\n*   **Type B: `(c b c)`**: `(T&T)`, `(T|T)`, `(T|F)`, `(F|T)`. Correct, **4** true expressions.\n*   **Type C: `c1 b1 c2 b2 c3`**:\n    *   `& |`: `(c&c)|c`. True for: (T&T)|T, (T&T)|F, (T&F)|T, (F&T)|T, (F&F)|T. Correct, **5**.\n    *   `| &`: `c|(c&c)`. True for: T|any, F|(T&T). T|... gives 4 combos. F|(T&T) is 1. Total **5**.\n    *   `& &`: `c&c&c`. Only `T&T&T` is true. Correct, **1**.\n    *   `| |`: `c|c|c`. Only `F|F|F` is false. Correct, **7**.\n    *   Total: 5+5+1+7 = **18**. Correct.\n*   **Type D: One unary, one binary**:\n    *   `!(c b c)`: `!(T&F)`, `!(F&T)`, `!(F&F)` are T. `!(F|F)` is T. Total **4**. Correct.\n    *   `(!c) b c`: `(!F)&T` is T. `(!T)|T`, `(!F)|T`, `(!F)|F` are T. 1+3=**4**. Correct.\n    *   `c b (!c)`: Symmetric to the previous case. **4**. Correct.\n    *   Total: 4+4+4 = **12**. Correct.\n*   **Type E: Two unary, one binary**:\n    *   `!c & !c`: `!F&!F` is T. **1**. Correct.\n    *   `!c | !c`: All but `!T|!T` are T. **3**. Correct.\n    *   `!!c & c` (`c&c`): `!!T&T` is T. **1**. Correct.\n    *   `!!c | c` (`c|c`): `!!T|T`, `!!T|F`, `!!F|T`. **3**. Correct.\n    *   `c & !!c`: `T&!!T`. **1**. Correct.\n    *   `c | !!c`: `T|!!T`, `F|!!T`, `T|!!F`. **3**. Correct.\n    *   Total: 1+3+1+3+1+3 = **12**. Correct.\n*   **Type F: Pure unary/grouping**:\n    *   `((c))`: `((T))` is T. **1**. Correct.\n    *   `!(!c)`: string `!(!T)`. `!(!T)` is `!F` which is T. **1**. Correct.\n    *   `!!(c)`: string `!!(T)`. `!!(T)` is T. **1**. Correct.\n    *   `(!!c)`: string `(!!T)`. `(T)` is T. **1**. Correct.\n    *   `!((c))`: string `!((F))`. `!((F))` is `!F` which is T. **1**. Correct.\n    *   Total: **5**. Correct.\n\nFinal sum: 4 + 18 + 12 + 12 + 5 = 51. The detailed enumeration appears to be correct and self-consistent.\n\n<<<51>>>"
