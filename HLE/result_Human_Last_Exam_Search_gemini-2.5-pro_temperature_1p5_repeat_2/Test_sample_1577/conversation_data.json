    "The ground state degeneracy (GSD) of the toric code is a property determined by the topology of the surface on which it is defined. Specifically, it depends on the genus (`g`) of the surface and the number of boundaries (or \"holes\") (`b`).\n\nThe number of logical qubits (`k`) that can be encoded is given by the formula `k = 2g + b - 1`. The ground state degeneracy is then `2^k`.\n\nIn the context of this problem, we are considering a system with `n` smooth holes and `m` rough holes. A common setting for this is a planar surface, which is topologically a sphere with one large puncture that forms the outer boundary. The genus of such a surface is `g=0`.\n\nThe total number of boundaries, `b`, is the sum of the explicitly mentioned holes and the implicit outer boundary of the plane.\n- Number of smooth inner holes = `n`\n- Number of rough inner holes = `m`\n- Number of outer boundaries = 1\n\nThus, the total number of boundaries is `b = n + m + 1`.\n\nNow, we can calculate the number of logical qubits `k` using the formula:\n`k = 2g + b - 1`\nSubstituting `g=0` and `b = n + m + 1`:\n`k = 2(0) + (n + m + 1) - 1`\n`k = n + m`\n\nThe ground space degeneracy is `2^k`, which equals `2^(n+m)`.\n\nThis result is consistent with the understanding that for a planar code, each additional hole (or defect) can be used to encode a logical qubit when referenced against the outer boundary or other holes.\n\nComparing this result with the given answer choices:\nA. 2^(m+n)\nB. 2^(m+n-2)\nC. 2^(m+n+2)\nD. 2^(2m)\nE. 2^(2n)\nF. 2^(\\delta_{m,0}+\\delta_{n,0}+m+n)\n\nThe derived ground space degeneracy `2^(n+m)` matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
