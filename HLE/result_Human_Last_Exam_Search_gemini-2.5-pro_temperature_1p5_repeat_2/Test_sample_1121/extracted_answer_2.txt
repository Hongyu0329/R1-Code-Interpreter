A specific number of non-Clifford gates cannot be provided because it is not a fixed quantity. For a distance-3 code, the concept is ill-defined as the code is too weak for robust universal computation at the given error rate. For a distance-5 code, the number of required non-Clifford gates is entirely dependent on the complexity of the specific quantum algorithm to be executed and the desired precision of the final output.
