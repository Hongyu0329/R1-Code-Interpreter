The best choice for the pair of step sizes $(\gamma_1, \gamma_2)$ is given by the reciprocals of the roots of the appropriately scaled Chebyshev polynomial of degree 2. The values are:
$$ \gamma_1 = \frac{2}{M+1 + \frac{M-1}{\sqrt{2}}} $$
$$ \gamma_2 = \frac{2}{M+1 - \frac{M-1}{\sqrt{2}}} $$
The order of the step sizes $\gamma_1$ and $\gamma_2$ is interchangeable.
