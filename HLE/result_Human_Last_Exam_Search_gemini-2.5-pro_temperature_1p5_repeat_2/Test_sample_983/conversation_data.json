    "The next number in the sequence is likely 2364.\n\nThe provided sequence is: 1014, 1020, 1032, 1050, 1104, 1224, 1230, 1290, 1410, 1440, 1452, 1482, 1500, 1512, 1560, 1584, 1602, 1734, 1812, 1890, 1902, 1932, 1974, 2004, 2040, 2064, 2070, 2130, 2142, 2274, 2340, 2352.\n\nUpon analysis, a clear and simple mathematical progression is not immediately apparent. The differences between consecutive numbers are not constant, nor do they follow a simple pattern.\n\nHowever, a key characteristic of all the numbers in the sequence is that they are divisible by 6. A number is divisible by 6 if it is divisible by both 2 (i.e., it is an even number) and 3 (i.e., the sum of its digits is divisible by 3). All numbers in the sequence meet these criteria.\n\nSince the sequence is composed of a specific selection of numbers divisible by 6, and without a discernible rule for this selection, a definitive prediction of the next term is challenging. The gaps between the numbers appear irregular.\n\nHowever, if we examine the difference between the last two numbers:\n2352 - 2340 = 12\n\nA plausible, though not certain, continuation of the sequence would be to add this difference to the last term.\n\n2352 + 12 = 2364\n\nThe number 2364 is also divisible by 6 (it is even, and the sum of its digits, 2 + 3 + 6 + 4 = 15, is divisible by 3), which is consistent with the known properties of the sequence. While other more complex patterns might exist, this represents a logical continuation based on the immediate preceding terms.\n\n<<<2364>>>"
