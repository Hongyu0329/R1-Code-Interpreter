To be functionally accurate, the picnic table must transition from a flat, straight (trans) form to a bent (cis) form at sunrise due to UV light. At sunset, it must return from the bent shape back to the flat, straight shape, a process driven by visible light or the absence of UV light (thermal relaxation).
