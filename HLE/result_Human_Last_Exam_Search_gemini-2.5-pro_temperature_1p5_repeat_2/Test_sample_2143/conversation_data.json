    "The initial search for \"Veronika Campan\" was not successful. The results show \"Veronica Campanucci\", \"Veronika Lancikova\", \"Mihaela Campan\", \"Veronika Piscov√°\", \"Veronika Prinzo\", and \"Veronika Miller\", none of whom seem to be working in a field related to philosophy, theology, or legal interpretation concerning the described topic. The search results are primarily in the fields of medicine, biology, design, and environmental science. It seems there might be a misspelling of the name.\n\nLet's try to find the \"HE\" and \"HIS work\" through the concepts mentioned: \"end of work\", \"another's material possessions\", and \"prohibition against representation\". This combination strongly points to an analysis of the Ten Commandments, specifically the last one (\"thou shalt not covet\"). The \"prohibition against representation\" likely refers to the second commandment (\"thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image\").\n\nSo, I am looking for a thinker who analyzed the last commandment in relation to the second. I will search for interpretations of the Ten Commandments that connect coveting with the prohibition of images. The name \"Campan\" might be a red herring or a misspelling. A search for interpretations of the Decalogue (Ten Commandments) seems more promising.\n\nGiven the academic and interpretive nature of the question, I will focus on prominent philosophers or theologians known for their work on the Decalogue. I'll search for analyses that connect the tenth commandment to the second commandment.According to the interpretation cited, the thinker who addressed the issue of another's material possessions at the end of his work, by engaging with the prohibition against representation, is Jacques Lacan.\n\nThis interpretation refers to Lacan's analysis of the Ten Commandments, particularly in his work *Seminar VII: The Ethics of Psychoanalysis*. In the seminar, Lacan examines the final commandments, which prohibit coveting your neighbor's wife and possessions.\n\nThe \"prohibition against representation\" refers to the Second Commandment, which forbids the making of graven images. Lacan's interpretation suggests this prohibition is crucial for installing the subject into the symbolic order (language) at the expense of the imaginary (images). However, when he analyzes the final commandment concerning \"another's material possessions,\" Lacan links it to the unattainable desire and enjoyment (*jouissance*) of the other, which he calls *das Ding* (the Thing). His analysis posits that this primal object of desire is what the prohibition against images was meant to hold at a distance. Therefore, in discussing the commandment not to covet, Lacan is seen as returning to the core issue that the prohibition on representation attempts to manage.\n\n<<<Jacques Lacan>>>"
