    "The given equation is a Fredholm integral equation of the second kind:\n`u(x) = 1 + λ ∫₀¹ K(x, y) u(y) dy`, where the kernel is `K(x, y) = (xⁿ - yⁿ) / (x - y)`.\n\nThe kernel `K(x, y)` can be expanded as a finite sum:\n`K(x, y) = xⁿ⁻¹ + xⁿ⁻²y + ... + xyⁿ⁻² + yⁿ⁻¹`\nThis shows that `K(x,y)` is a degenerate (or separable) kernel.\n\nThe equation belongs to a class of problems that can be analyzed using the Fredholm alternative theorem. A solution `u(x)` exists for any `λ` unless `λ` is a *characteristic value*. A characteristic value is a `λ` for which the homogeneous equation `p(x) = λ ∫₀¹ K(x, y) p(y) dy` has a non-trivial solution `p(x)`. These solutions `p(x)` are called eigenfunctions of the integral operator.\n\nIf `λ` is a characteristic value, the original inhomogeneous equation has a solution if and only if the forcing term (in this case, the function `f(x) = 1`) is orthogonal to all the eigenfunctions `p(x)` corresponding to `λ`. That is, `∫₀¹ 1 * p(x) dx = 0`. If this condition is not met, the equation has no solution.\n\nHere, the analysis shows two key points:\n1.  The eigenfunctions `p(x)` of the integral operator are polynomials of degree at most `n-1`.\n2.  It can be proven that for any eigenfunction `p(x)` of this specific operator, the integral `∫₀¹ p(x) dx` is never zero.\n\nThis means that the orthogonality condition for the existence of a solution is never met for any characteristic value `λ`. Therefore, the equation has **no solution** for every characteristic value of `λ`.\n\nThe problem then reduces to finding these characteristic values. They are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues `μ` of the integral operator `L[p](x) = ∫₀¹ K(x,y) p(y) dy`. These eigenvalues can be found by solving the matrix eigenvalue problem `Mc = μc`, where `M` is an `n x n` matrix.\n\nThe values of `λ` for which the equation has no solutions are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the `n x n` matrix `M` whose entries are given by `Mᵢⱼ = 1/(n+i-j)` for `i, j = 1, ..., n`.\n\nFor example:\n*   For `n=1`, `M = [1]`. The only eigenvalue is `μ=1`, so `λ = 1/1 = 1`.\n*   For `n=2`, `M` is the matrix `[[1/2, 1], [1/3, 1/2]]`. The eigenvalues are `μ = (3 ± 2√3) / 6`, which leads to `λ = 1/μ = -6 ± 4√3`.\n\nThus, the values of `λ` for which the equation has no solution are the reciprocals of the `n` real, non-zero eigenvalues of the matrix `M`.\n\n<<<The values of λ for which the equation has no solution are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the n x n matrix M with entries Mᵢⱼ = 1/(n+i-j).>>>"
