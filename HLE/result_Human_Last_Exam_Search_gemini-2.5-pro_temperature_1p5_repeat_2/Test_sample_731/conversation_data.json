    "The semidihedral group $SD_{512}$ is a non-abelian group of order 512. Its structure is defined by the presentation $\\langle r, s \\mid r^{256} = s^2 = 1, srs = r^{127} \\rangle$. A power subgroup of a group $G$ is a subgroup that can be expressed as $G^k = \\{g^k \\mid g \\in G\\}$ for some integer $k$.\n\nTo determine the number of distinct power subgroups, we analyze the structure of $G^k$ for different values of $k$. The elements of $SD_{512}$ consist of two types: powers of $r$ (forming a cyclic subgroup of order 256), and elements of the form $sr^i$.\n\n1.  **When k is an odd integer:**\n    *   For any element $g = r^i$, its $k$-th power is $(r^i)^k = r^{ik}$. Since $k$ is odd, it is coprime to the order of $r$ (which is 256, a power of 2). This means that the set of all $k$-th powers of elements in $\\langle r \\rangle$ is $\\langle r \\rangle$ itself.\n    *   For the element $s$, its $k$-th power is $s^k = s$, since $k$ is odd.\n    *   The power subgroup $G^k$ therefore contains both the subgroup $\\langle r \\rangle$ and the element $s$. Since a subgroup must be closed under the group operation, any subgroup containing both $\\langle r \\rangle$ and $s$ must contain all elements generated by them, which is the entire group $SD_{512}$.\n    *   Thus, for any odd value of $k$, the power subgroup $G^k$ is the group $SD_{512}$ itself. This accounts for one power subgroup.\n\n2.  **When k is an even integer:**\n    *   Let $k = 2m$ for some integer $m$.\n    *   For any element $g = r^i$, its $k$-th power is $(r^i)^k = r^{ik} = r^{2mi}$. The set of all such powers forms the cyclic subgroup $\\langle r^k \\rangle = \\langle r^{\\gcd(k, 256)} \\rangle$.\n    *   For an element $g = sr^i$, we first compute its square: $(sr^i)^2 = sr^i s r^i$. Using the relation $sr^is = r^{127i}$, this simplifies to $(sr^i)^2 = r^{127i}r^i = r^{128i}$. The $k$-th power is then $(sr^i)^k = ((sr^i)^2)^m = (r^{128i})^m = r^{128im}$.\n    *   Therefore, for an even $k$, the set of all $k$-th powers $G^k$ consists only of powers of $r$. Specifically, $G^k$ is the union of the sets $\\{r^{ik} \\mid i \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}$ and $\\{r^{128im} \\mid i \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}$. This union is simply the larger of the two subgroups, which is $\\langle r^{\\gcd(k, 256)} \\rangle$, because $\\gcd(128m, 256)$ is a multiple of $\\gcd(k,256) = \\gcd(2m, 256)$.\n    *   Since $k$ must be even, the value of $d = \\gcd(k, 256)$ must be an even divisor of 256. The divisors of 256 are $1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256$. The even divisors are $2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256$.\n    *   For each of these 8 even divisors $d$, we can find an even integer $k$ (for instance, $k=d$) such that $\\gcd(k, 256) = d$. This gives 8 distinct power subgroups: $\\langle r^2 \\rangle, \\langle r^4 \\rangle, \\langle r^8 \\rangle, \\langle r^{16} \\rangle, \\langle r^{32} \\rangle, \\langle r^{64} \\rangle, \\langle r^{128} \\rangle,$ and $\\langle r^{256} \\rangle = \\{1\\}$.\n\nIn total, we have 1 power subgroup from the case where k is odd (the group itself) and 8 power subgroups from the case where k is even (all of which are cyclic subgroups of $\\langle r \\rangle$).\n\nThe distinct power subgroups are: $SD_{512}$, $\\langle r^2 \\rangle$, $\\langle r^4 \\rangle$, $\\langle r^8 \\rangle$, $\\langle r^{16} \\rangle$, $\\langle r^{32} \\rangle$, $\\langle r^{64} \\rangle$, $\\langle r^{128} \\rangle$, and $\\{1\\}$.\n\nCounting these subgroups, we find there are $1 + 8 = 9$ power subgroups.\n\n<<<9>>>"
