    "The exact value of the angle $\\alpha$ for the A($\\alpha$)-stability of the fourth-order Backward Differentiation Formula (BDF4) has been determined through analytical methods. For a numerical method to be A($\\alpha$)-stable, its stability region must contain the angular sector $S_\\alpha = \\{z \\in \\mathbb{C} : |\\arg(-z)| \\le \\alpha, z \\ne 0\\}$. The maximum angle $\\alpha$ is found by determining the tangent from the origin to the boundary of the stability region in the left half-plane.\n\nThe stability of BDF methods has been a subject of study for half a century. While initial calculations provided numerical approximations, more recent work has led to the discovery of exact expressions for these angles.\n\nFor the BDF4 scheme, the maximum angle of stability, often denoted as $\\vartheta_4$ or $\\alpha_4$, is given by the expression:\n$\\alpha = \\arcsin\\left(\\frac{699\\sqrt{3}}{25\\sqrt{2555}}\\right)$\n\nThis value is approximately 73.35Â°. The derivation of this exact value involves analyzing the boundary of the stability region of the BDF4 method. BDF methods are widely used for solving stiff differential equations due to their strong stability properties. While BDF1 and BDF2 are A-stable (meaning $\\alpha=90^\\circ$), methods of order higher than 2 cannot be A-stable, but they possess a property called A($\\alpha$)-stability.\n\n<<<$\\arctan\\left(\\frac{699\\sqrt{3}}{\\sqrt{8525}}\\right)$>>>"
