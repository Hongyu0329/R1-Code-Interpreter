    "An internal adjunction in the simplex category $\\Delta$, when viewed as a locally posetal 2-category, corresponds to a standard adjunction between posets. The objects $[n]$ in this category are the finite ordinals $[n] = \\{0, 1, \\dots, n\\}$ with their usual order.\n\nAn adjunction between two posets, in this case from $[n]$ to $[m]$, consists of a pair of order-preserving maps, $f: [n] \\to [m]$ (the left adjoint) and $g: [m] \\to [n]$ (the right adjoint), satisfying the condition:\n$f(i) \\le j \\iff i \\le g(j)$ for all $i \\in [n]$ and $j \\in [m]$.\n\nThis relationship implies that each map uniquely determines the other. Therefore, the number of adjunctions is equal to the number of possible left adjoints from $$ to $$.\n\nFor a map $f: P \\to Q$ between complete lattices to be a left adjoint, it must preserve all suprema (joins). Since the posets $[n]$ are finite chains, they are complete lattices.\nAn order-preserving map between such chains automatically preserves suprema of all non-empty subsets. For $f$ to be a left adjoint, it must also preserve the supremum of the empty set.\nIn the poset $[n]$, the supremum of the empty set is the least element, 0. In the poset $[m]$, it is also 0. Thus, a map $f: [n] \\to [m]$ is a left adjoint if and only if it is order-preserving and satisfies $f(0) = 0$.\n\nSo, we need to count the number of order-preserving maps $f: \\to$ such that $f(0)=0$.\nAn order-preserving map is defined by a non-decreasing sequence of values. Since $f(0)$ is fixed at 0, we need to determine the values of $f(1), f(2), \\dots, f(23)$ such that:\n$0 \\le f(1) \\le f(2) \\le \\dots \\le f(23) \\le 37$.\n\nThis is a classic combinatorial problem of choosing 23 numbers from the set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 37\\}$ (which has $37+1 = 38$ elements) with replacement, where the order of selection does not matter as it's determined by the non-decreasing condition. This is a \"stars and bars\" problem, and the number of ways is given by the multiset coefficient formula:\n$\\binom{k+r-1}{r}$, where $r=23$ (the number of items to choose) and $k=38$ (the number of categories to choose from).\n\nThe number of such maps is:\n$\\binom{38+23-1}{23} = \\binom{60}{23}$.\n\nCalculating this value:\n$\\binom{60}{23} = \\frac{60!}{23! \\cdot (60-23)!} = \\frac{60!}{23! \\cdot 37!} = 463,763,248,337,033,520$.\n\nDually, we could count the number of right adjoints $g: \\to$. A map is a right adjoint if it preserves all infima (meets), which requires it to be order-preserving and to map the top element to the top element, i.e., $g(37) = 23$. This leads to the same combinatorial count: $\\binom{(23+1)+37-1}{37} = \\binom{60}{37} = \\binom{60}{23}$.\n\nThe number of internal adjunctions in $\\Delta$ from $$ to $$ is equal to the value of $\\binom{60}{23}$.\n\n<<<463763248337033520>>>"
