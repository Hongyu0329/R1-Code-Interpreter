    "The problem asks for the minimum total number of vertices in a collection of bipartite graphs whose edges cover all the edges of a complete graph \\( K_n \\) with n = 35. This is a classic problem in graph theory related to the concept of the capacity of a bipartite covering.\n\nThe minimum number of bipartite graphs required to cover all edges of \\( K_n \\) is known to be \\( \\lceil \\log_2(n) \\rceil \\). A standard construction for this involves assigning a unique binary vector of length \\( k = \\lceil \\log_2(n) \\rceil \\) to each vertex of \\( K_n \\). Then, for each of the \\( k \\) bit positions, a bipartite graph is formed where the vertices are partitioned based on whether they have a 0 or a 1 in that position.\n\nIn this construction, each of the \\( k \\) bipartite graphs utilizes all \\( n \\) vertices of the original complete graph. The sum of the number of vertices over all bipartite graphs in this family, also known as the capacity of the covering, is therefore \\( n \\times k \\), or \\( n \\times \\lceil \\log_2(n) \\rceil \\). This is known to be the minimum possible sum.\n\nFor the specific case where n = 35, we first calculate the value of \\( \\lceil \\log_2(35) \\rceil \\):\n*   \\( 2^5 = 32 \\)\n*   \\( 2^6 = 64 \\)\n\nSince 35 is between 32 and 64, the base-2 logarithm of 35 is between 5 and 6. Therefore, the smallest integer greater than or equal to \\( \\log_2(35) \\) is 6.\n\\( \\lceil \\log_2(35) \\rceil = 6 \\)\n\nNow, we multiply this value by n to find the minimum total number of vertices:\nMinimum number of vertices = \\( 35 \\times 6 = 210 \\)\n\n<<<210>>>"
