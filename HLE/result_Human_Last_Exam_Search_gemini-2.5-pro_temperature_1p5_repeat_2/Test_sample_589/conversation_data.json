    "After conducting an extensive search for a Hollywood feature film produced by a major film studio in which a teenager rides a pink bike and pedals directly toward an oncoming car, no definitive match could be found.\n\nNumerous search queries were executed using various keyword combinations, including \"teenager on pink bike pedals toward oncoming car movie,\" \"movie scene girl on pink bike rides into car,\" and \"coming-of-age film pink bike car chicken.\" The search results included a range of media such as TikTok videos with movie clips, discussions on forums like Reddit where users attempted to identify films with similar themes, and articles about movies from the 80s and 90s that feature bicycles.\n\nSome search results referenced the dangerous real-life trend of teenagers playing \"chicken\" with cars on their bikes, and others discussed films with general themes of teenage rebellion or bike stunts. The movie *The Driver* (1978) features a \"playing chicken\" scene in a warehouse involving a car and a truck, but not a teenager on a pink bike. A blog post on Medium titled \"Playing Chicken\" describes a personal anecdote of a childhood game of chicken on a pink bike, but does not reference a film.\n\nWhile many films feature teenagers and bicycles, and some touch upon themes of daredevilry, no specific scene matching the user's detailed description from a major Hollywood feature film could be identified within the search results.\n\n<<<I am unable to identify a Hollywood feature film produced by a major film studio that depicts a teenager riding a pink bike and pedaling directly toward an oncoming car.>>>"
