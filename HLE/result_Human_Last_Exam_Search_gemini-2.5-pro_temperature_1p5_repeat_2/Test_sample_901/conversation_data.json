    "The reaction of (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane with potassium tert-butoxide results in a major product of **3-methylcyclohexene**. This outcome is dictated by the specific stereochemical requirements of the E2 elimination reaction.\n\nHere is a step-by-step explanation of the reaction:\n*   **Reaction Type**: The substrate is a secondary alkyl halide reacting with potassium tert-butoxide, a strong, sterically hindered base. These conditions strongly favor an E2 (bimolecular elimination) reaction.\n*   **Stereochemistry of the Reactant**: The (1S,2R) designation indicates that the bromine atom and the methyl group are *trans* to each other on the cyclohexane ring.\n*   **E2 Reaction Requirement**: A crucial requirement for E2 reactions in cyclohexane rings is that the leaving group (in this case, bromine) and the hydrogen atom being removed must be in a *trans-diaxial* (or anti-periplanar) conformation. This means they must both be in axial positions, oriented on opposite faces of the ring.\n*   **Chair Conformations**:\n    1.  The most stable chair conformation of a *trans*-1,2-disubstituted cyclohexane has both substituents in equatorial positions. However, in this conformation, the bromine is not axial, so no E2 reaction can occur.\n    2.  The molecule must flip to its less stable chair conformation, where both the bromine atom and the methyl group are in axial positions. This places the leaving group (bromine) in the necessary axial orientation for elimination.\n*   **Identifying the Product**: In the reactive (diaxial) conformation, the base, potassium tert-butoxide, looks for an anti-periplanar proton to abstract.\n    *   The hydrogen on the carbon with the methyl group (C2) is in an equatorial position, not anti-periplanar to the axial bromine. Therefore, elimination cannot occur toward this carbon to form the more substituted 1-methylcyclohexene (the Zaitsev product).\n    *   The hydrogen on carbon-6 (C6) is in an axial position and is perfectly aligned (anti-periplanar) for elimination with the axial bromine.\n    *   Consequently, the base abstracts this proton from C6, and the double bond forms between C1 and C6. This results in the formation of 3-methylcyclohexene, which is the less substituted alkene (the Hofmann-like product).\n\nEven though potassium tert-butoxide typically favors the formation of the less substituted (Hofmann) product due to steric hindrance, in this specific case, the stereochemical constraint of the anti-periplanar arrangement is the deciding factor, leading exclusively to the formation of 3-methylcyclohexene.\n\n<<<3-methylcyclohexene>>>"
