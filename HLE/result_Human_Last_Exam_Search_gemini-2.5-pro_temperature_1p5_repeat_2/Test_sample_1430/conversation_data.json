    "Let C be a Riemann surface of genus g=3 and X be its 15th symmetric power, denoted as X = Sym^15(C). The rank of the Néron-Severi group of X, also known as the Picard number ρ(X), depends on the nature of the curve C. We can determine the smallest and largest possible values for this rank by examining the relationship between X and the Jacobian variety of C.\n\nThe key result that connects the Néron-Severi group of the symmetric power of a curve to its Jacobian is an isomorphism that holds for d ≥ g. In our case, d=15 and g=3, so the condition is met. The rank of the Néron-Severi group of X is given by the formula:\n\nρ(X) = 1 + ρ(Jac(C))\n\nHere, Jac(C) is the Jacobian variety of the curve C, which is a 3-dimensional abelian variety, and ρ(Jac(C)) is its Néron-Severi rank. Therefore, the problem reduces to finding the smallest and largest possible values of ρ(Jac(C)) for a genus 3 curve.\n\n### Smallest Possible Rank\n\nThe smallest possible rank occurs for a \"generic\" curve. For a generic curve C of genus 3, its Jacobian Jac(C) is a simple abelian variety whose ring of endomorphisms is just the integers, i.e., End(Jac(C)) = ℤ. The Néron-Severi group's rank, in this case, corresponds to the rank of the group of symmetric endomorphisms, which is 1. This rank corresponds to the divisor class of the canonical principal polarization of the Jacobian.\n\nThus, the minimum possible value for ρ(Jac(C)) is 1.\nThis leads to the smallest possible rank for NS(X):\n\n**Smallest rank ρ(X) = 1 + 1 = 2.**\n\n### Largest Possible Rank\n\nThe rank of the Néron-Severi group of an abelian variety of dimension g is bounded above by g^2. For Jac(C), this means ρ(Jac(C)) ≤ 3^2 = 9. This maximum is achieved for curves with special properties, specifically those with complex multiplication (CM).\n\nA curve C has a Jacobian with maximal Néron-Severi rank if Jac(C) is isogenous to the cube of an elliptic curve E that has complex multiplication, i.e., Jac(C) ~ E³. The existence of such genus 3 curves is known. For example, the Jacobian of the Fermat quartic curve, given by the equation x⁴ + y⁴ + z⁴ = 0, is a genus 3 curve whose Jacobian is isogenous to the cube of the elliptic curve with j-invariant 1728 (CM by Z[i]).\n\nWhen Jac(C) is isogenous to E³, the rank of its Néron-Severi group is g², which is 9. This is the maximum possible rank for the Jacobian of a genus 3 curve.\n\nThus, the maximum possible value for ρ(Jac(C)) is 9.\nThis gives the largest possible rank for NS(X):\n\n**Largest rank ρ(X) = 1 + 9 = 10.**\n\nIn summary, the rank of the Néron-Severi group of the 15th symmetric power of a genus 3 Riemann surface C varies depending on the endomorphism algebra of its Jacobian. It is minimal for generic curves and maximal for certain curves with complex multiplication.\n\nThe smallest possible rank is 2.\nThe largest possible rank is 10.\n\n<<<The smallest possible rank is 2 and the largest possible rank is 10.>>>"
