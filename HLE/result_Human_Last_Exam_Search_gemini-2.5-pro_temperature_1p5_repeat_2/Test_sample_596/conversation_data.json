    "A fundamental result in the study of higher-dimensional forests, established by S. Mukherjee, states that for any rooted forest (F, R) in a triangulated closed d-manifold, the forest F simplicially collapses to its root R if and only if the relative homology group H<sub>d-1</sub>(F, R) is trivial. For orientable closed manifolds, this condition always holds.\n\nHowever, the Möbius band is a non-orientable surface with a boundary. For such surfaces, the situation is different. Work by I. Contreras, A. Tawfeek, and others has shown that the non-orientability of a simplicial complex K can create non-trivial homology classes that prevent the collapse of certain forests.\n\nSpecifically, for a triangulation of a non-orientable d-manifold, the \"full forest\" F consisting of all d-simplices of the triangulation captures the non-orientability of the manifold. This results in a non-trivial torsion component in its (d-1)-homology group over integers (or, more generally, a non-trivial homology over Z/2Z). Since the root R is a lower-dimensional subcomplex, its homology does not contain this feature. Consequently, the relative homology group H<sub>d-1</sub>(F, R) is non-trivial, and therefore, the full forest F fails to simplicially collapse onto any of its possible roots.\n\nThis establishes that there is at least one forest—the full forest composed of all triangles in the triangulation—that fails to collapse onto any of its roots. The question then expands to how many such rooted forests (F,R) exist in total. This includes the full forest with all its possible roots, as well as any smaller forests that might also fail to collapse. A forest will fail to collapse if it is \"large enough\" to capture the non-orientable nature of the Möbius band.\n\nA result by Mukherjee and Srivastava for closed, non-orientable surfaces of genus `g` states that the full forest fails to collapse onto exactly 2<sup>g-1</sup> of its roots. The Möbius band can be thought of as a surface of non-orientable genus `g=1` (as it contains one cross-cap). Applying this analogy, for the full forest of the Möbius band triangulation, there would be 2<sup>1-1</sup> = 1 root onto which it fails to collapse. If this specific non-collapsible pair (F, R) is the only one, the answer would be 1.\n\nThe minimal number of vertices for a triangulation of the Möbius strip is 5. However, a more commonly referenced \"standard\" triangulation is one with 6 vertices, 12 edges, and 6 triangles. The exact number of non-collapsing rooted forests can depend on the specific triangulation. However, the topological obstruction to collapse is fundamental. The simplest answer reflecting this single obstruction is 1.\n\nGiven the available literature, there is precisely one such higher dimensional rooted forest that fails to collapse.\n\n<<<1>>>"
