    "The Wittig reaction is a chemical process that converts aldehydes or ketones into alkenes through the reaction with a phosphorus ylide, also known as a Wittig reagent. This reaction is a reliable method for forming a carbon-carbon double bond at a specific location.\n\nThe reactants in question are:\n*   **Pivalaldehyde**: Also known as 2,2-dimethylpropanal, this is an aldehyde with a tert-butyl group attached to the carbonyl group. Its structure is (CH₃)₃C-CHO.\n*   **(2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ⁵-phosphane**: This is the phosphorus ylide. The ylide is formed from the corresponding phosphonium salt, (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethyl)triphenylphosphonium bromide. The structure of the ylide is Ph₃P=CHCH₂(2-ClC₆H₄).\n\nIn the Wittig reaction, the oxygen atom of the aldehyde is exchanged for the carbon group of the ylide, leading to the formation of an alkene and triphenylphosphine oxide (Ph₃P=O) as a byproduct.\n\nThe reaction proceeds as follows:\n(CH₃)₃C-CHO + Ph₃P=CHCH₂(2-ClC₆H₄) → (CH₃)₃C-CH=CH-CH₂(2-ClC₆H₄) + Ph₃P=O\n\nThe resulting product is an alkene. To name this product, the longest carbon chain containing the double bond is identified, which is a pentene chain. Numbering the carbons, the structure is `(CH₃)₃C-C⁴H=C³H-C²H₂-C¹(C₆H₄Cl)`.\n\nThe systematic IUPAC name for this product is **1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene**.\n\nThe stereochemistry of the double bond (E/Z configuration) depends on the specific reaction conditions and the nature of the ylide. Unstabilized ylides, like the one in this reaction, typically favor the formation of the Z-alkene. However, the steric hindrance from the pivalaldehyde may influence this outcome. Without more details on the reaction conditions, predicting the exact stereoisomer is not possible.\n\n<<<1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene>>>"
