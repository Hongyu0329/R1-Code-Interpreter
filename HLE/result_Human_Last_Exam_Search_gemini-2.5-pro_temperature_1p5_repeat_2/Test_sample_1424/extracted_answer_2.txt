In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function \( G_0 \) depends inversely on the single-particle energy eigenvalues \( \epsilon_k \). In frequency-momentum space, this relationship is expressed as: \[ G_0(\omega, k) = \frac{1}{\omega - \epsilon_k + i\eta} \] where \( \omega \) is the frequency and \( i\eta \) is an infinitesimal term to ensure proper time-ordering.
