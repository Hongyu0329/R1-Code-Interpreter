    "### A Deeper Dive into Baseball's Triple Crown Winners\n\nIn the history of Major League Baseball, a Triple Crown is one of the most challenging feats for a hitter to accomplish. To earn the distinction, a player must lead their respective league—American or National—in three key statistical categories: batting average, home runs, and runs batted in (RBIs) in the same season.\n\nSince RBIs became an official statistic in 1920, there have been 10 players who have won a total of 12 batting Triple Crowns in the American and National Leagues. The most recent player to achieve this was Miguel Cabrera in 2012 with the Detroit Tigers, who ended a 45-year gap since the previous winner.\n\nTwo players in this group have won the Triple Crown twice:\n*   **Ted Williams** with the Boston Red Sox in 1942 and 1947.\n*   **Rogers Hornsby** with the St. Louis Cardinals in 1922 and 1925.\n\nIn 2024, Major League Baseball officially incorporated statistics from the Negro Leagues, which has expanded the list of Triple Crown winners. This has led to the recognition of several other players who achieved this milestone. Including the Negro Leagues, there have been a total of 27 Triple Crown winners. Four players have won multiple Triple Crowns when considering this expanded list.\n\nHere is a list of the American and National League Triple Crown winners and their respective seasons:\n\n| Year | Player | Team | League |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| 2012 | Miguel Cabrera | Detroit Tigers | American |\n| 1967 | Carl Yastrzemski | Boston Red Sox | American |\n| 1966 | Frank Robinson | Baltimore Orioles | American |\n| 1956 | Mickey Mantle | New York Yankees | American |\n| 1947 | Ted Williams | Boston Red Sox | American |\n| 1942 | Ted Williams | Boston Red Sox | American |\n| 1937 | Joe Medwick | St. Louis Cardinals | National |\n| 1934 | Lou Gehrig | New York Yankees | American |\n| 1933 | Jimmie Foxx | Philadelphia Athletics| American |\n| 1933 | Chuck Klein | Philadelphia Phillies| National |\n| 1925 | Rogers Hornsby | St. Louis Cardinals | National |\n| 1922 | Rogers Hornsby | St. Louis Cardinals | National |\n| 1912 | Heinie Zimmerman | Chicago Cubs | National |\n| 1909 | Ty Cobb | Detroit Tigers | American |\n| 1901 | Nap Lajoie | Philadelphia Athletics| American |\n| 1894 | Hugh Duffy | Boston Beaneaters | National |\n| 1887 | Tip O'Neill | St. Louis Browns | American Association |\n| 1878 | Paul Hines | Providence Grays | National |\n\nIt is also worth noting that there is a Triple Crown for pitchers, which is awarded for leading the league in wins, strikeouts, and earned run average (ERA).<<<17>>>"
