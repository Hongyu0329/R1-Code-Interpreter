    "After a thorough search for a choreographic analysis of Svetlana Zakharova's performance in the 2014 Bolshoi Theatre production of \"Swan Lake\" choreographed by Yuri Grigorovich, a definitive count of the *sissone fermes* in the Act II Odette variation could not be found in available written materials.\n\nReviews of the production, performed in July 2014, praise Zakharova for her technical brilliance and artistry as Odette. Articles mention the existence of a video recording of this production, sometimes dated as a 2015 release, which would be the only certain method to determine the exact number of the specified ballet steps. However, detailed choreographic notes or a step-by-step breakdown of the variation that would include this specific count are not available in the public domain.\n\nAnalysis of different ballerinas' interpretations of Odette, including Zakharova's, have been conducted, but they either focus on different performances or do not provide the granular detail required to answer the question. Similarly, general information about Yuri Grigorovich's \"Swan Lake\" choreography does not include specific counts of steps within individual variations.\n\nWithout access to view the performance directly, or a document with a precise choreographic transcript, it is impossible to provide the exact number of *sissone fermes* performed.\n\n<<<I am unable to answer this question as the information is not available in any of the search results.>>>"
