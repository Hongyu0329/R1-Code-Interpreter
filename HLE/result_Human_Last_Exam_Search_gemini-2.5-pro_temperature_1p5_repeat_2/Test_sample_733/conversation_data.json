    "### Infinitely Many Finite Groups Can Contain Maximal Product-Free Sets of Size 2\n\nThere are infinitely many finite groups that contain maximal by inclusion product-free sets of size 2. These groups, however, fall into a finite number of specific structural families. A product-free set in a group G is a subset S such that for any two elements a and b in S (not necessarily distinct), their product ab is not in S. A maximal by inclusion product-free set is a product-free set that is not properly contained within any other product-free set in the group.\n\nThe classification of finite groups containing such sets of size 2 was completed by Michael Giudici and Sarah Hart. Their work, along with related research, shows that if a finite group G contains a maximal by inclusion product-free set S of size 2, then the structure of G is specifically constrained.\n\nLet S be a maximal by inclusion product-free set of size 2 in a finite group G. A key result is that the subgroup generated by S, denoted as `<S>`, is a normal subgroup of G, and the quotient group G/`<S>` is either trivial or an elementary abelian 2-group (a group where every element is its own inverse).\n\nThe possible structures for the subgroup `<S>` generated by a maximal product-free set S = {a, b} of size 2 are as follows:\n\n*   **If S contains no involutions:** The subgroup `<S>` must be a cyclic group generated by one of the elements in S. The specific cyclic groups are C₅, C₆, C₇, C₈, C₉, or C₁₀.\n*   **If S contains an involution:** Let 'a' be the involution (an element of order 2). The possible structures for `<S>` are:\n    *   The cyclic group of order 6, C₆. In this case, 'a' is the unique involution and 'b' is an element of order 3.\n    *   The dihedral group of order 6, D₆ (which is isomorphic to the symmetric group S₃). Here, 'a' can be any involution and 'b' any element of order 3.\n    *   The Klein four-group, C₂ × C₂. In this case, 'a' and 'b' can be any pair of distinct involutions.\n\nSince G can be any extension of these specified subgroups `<S>` by an elementary abelian 2-group, and there are infinitely many non-isomorphic elementary abelian 2-groups (C₂)^n for n ≥ 0, there are infinitely many finite groups that contain a maximal by inclusion product-free set of size 2.\n\nFor instance, if `<S>` is C₆, then not only C₆ itself, but also C₆ × C₂, C₆ × C₂ × C₂, and so on, are all groups that possess a maximal by inclusion product-free set of size 2. Each of these represents a distinct isomorphism class, leading to an infinite number of such groups. The classification, therefore, lies in defining these families of groups based on the structure of the subgroup generated by the set and its relationship with the entire group.\n\n<<<There are infinitely many finite groups, which fall into a finite number of families, that contain maximal by inclusion product-free sets of size 2."
