    "In the Oscar-nominated film *Michael Clayton*, the character Arthur Edens, played by Tom Wilkinson in a role that earned him a Best Supporting Actor nomination, effectively seals his fate shortly after a scene involving a bus.\n\nArthur, a brilliant but mentally unstable lawyer, has a manic episode and decides to expose a multi-billion dollar cover-up by his firm's client, the agrochemical company U-North. After being bailed out of jail by the firm's \"fixer,\" Michael Clayton (George Clooney), Arthur's erratic behavior continues. In a key sequence, he is seen interacting with strangers and is present as a bus arrives. While the specific line \"Thank you\" as he boards is not explicitly detailed in search results, his subsequent murder is a direct consequence of his actions to expose U-North. The operatives, hired by U-North's general counsel Karen Crowder (Tilda Swinton, who won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress), break into his apartment and murder him, making it look like a suicide.\n\nThe 2007 film was nominated for a total of seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay, Best Actor for Clooney, Best Supporting Actor for Wilkinson, and Best Original Score, with Swinton winning for Best Supporting Actress.\n\n<<<Michael Clayton>>>"
