    "The space of 3-subspaces of $\\mathbb{R}^5$ is the real Grassmannian manifold $G(3, 5)$. The integral cohomology ring $H^*(G(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z})$ is a graded abelian group, and its torsion subgroup is the direct sum of the torsion parts of each integral cohomology group $H^k(G(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\nThe additive structure of the integral cohomology of $G(3, 5)$, which is homeomorphic to $G(2, 5)$, is known. The cohomology groups are as follows:\n*   $H^0(G(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}$\n*   $H^1(G(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$\n*   $H^2(G(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}_2$\n*   $H^3(G(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2$\n*   $H^4(G(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}_2$\n*   $H^5(G(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}_2$\n*   $H^6(G(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}_2$\n\nThe torsion subgroup of the integral cohomology ring is the direct sum of the torsion components from each degree. All torsion is 2-torsion. Summing the torsion parts gives the total torsion subgroup $T$:\n\n$T = \\text{Tors}(H^2) \\oplus \\text{Tors}(H^3) \\oplus H^4 \\oplus H^5 \\oplus H^6$\n$T = \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2 = (\\mathbb{Z}_2)^5$\n\nThe rank of an abelian group is the dimension of the free part of the group, which is the number of copies of $\\mathbb{Z}$ in its decomposition into a direct sum of cyclic groups. A torsion group, by definition, is a group where every element has a finite order. Such a group has no free part. Therefore, the rank of any torsion group is 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
