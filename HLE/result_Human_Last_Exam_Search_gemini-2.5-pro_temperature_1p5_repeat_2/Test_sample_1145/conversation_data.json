    "The probability of finding a particle in a one-dimensional box in a specific interval is calculated by integrating the probability density function, |ψ(x)|², over that interval. For a particle in a 1D box of length 'a', the normalized wave function for the n=2 energy state is given by:\n\nψ₂(x) = √(2/a) * sin(2πx/a)\n\nThe probability density function, P(x), is the square of the wave function:\n\nP(x) = |ψ₂(x)|² = (2/a) * sin²(2πx/a)\n\nThe problem asks for the probability of finding the particle in the interval from x₁ = 0.495a to x₂ = 0.505a. This requires solving the following integral:\n\nP = ∫ [from 0.495a to 0.505a] (2/a) * sin²(2πx/a) dx\n\nTo solve this integral, the trigonometric identity sin²(θ) = (1 - cos(2θ))/2 is used. Substituting θ = 2πx/a, the integral becomes:\n\nP = (1/a) ∫ [from 0.495a to 0.505a] (1 - cos(4πx/a)) dx\n\nEvaluating this integral yields the expression:\n\nP = [x/a - sin(4πx/a)/(4π)] evaluated from 0.495a to 0.505a\n\nPlugging in the limits of integration:\n\nP = (0.505 - 0.495) - [sin(4π * 0.505) - sin(4π * 0.495)] / (4π)\nP = 0.01 - [sin(2.02π) - sin(1.98π)] / (4π)\n\nUsing trigonometric identities, this simplifies to:\n\nP = 0.01 - sin(0.02π) / (2π)\n\nCalculating the numerical value of this expression gives the probability. For n=2, the wave function has a node (a point of zero probability) at the center of the box, x = 0.5a. Since the interval [0.495a, 0.505a] is a small region centered around this node, the probability is expected to be very small.\n\nUsing computational tools to evaluate the final expression:\n\nP ≈ 0.01 - sin(0.06283) / 6.283\nP ≈ 0.01 - 0.06279 / 6.283\nP ≈ 0.01 - 0.0099934\nP ≈ 0.00000658\n\nThis can also be expressed as 6.58 x 10⁻⁶ or approximately 0.000658%.\n\n<<<6.58e-6>>>"
