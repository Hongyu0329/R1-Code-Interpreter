    "Two Nobel laureates were featured in Enron's infamous 2000 \"Ask Why\" advertising campaign. The two individuals were physicist and Nobel laureate Murray Gell-Mann and a second person who has been identified in some online discussions as an \"Indian commentator.\"\n\nMurray Gell-Mann, who won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1969 for his work on the theory of elementary particles, is consistently cited as having appeared in the commercials. In one of the \"Ask Why\" commercials, Gell-Mann is seen speaking about the importance of questioning assumptions.\n\nThe identity of the second Nobel laureate is less clear. Some online discussions refer to an \"Indian commentator\" also being in the commercial, but do not provide a specific name. Despite searches, the name and Nobel laureate status of this second individual could not be definitively confirmed from the available information.\n\nThe \"Ask Why\" campaign was a major advertising effort by Enron before its scandalous collapse. The commercials aimed to portray the company as innovative and a challenger of conventional wisdom.\n\n<<<Murray Gell-Mann and an unidentified individual believed to be an Indian commentator.>>>"
