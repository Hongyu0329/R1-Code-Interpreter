    "An open reading frame (ORF) is a continuous stretch of codons that do not contain a stop codon. Since the provided nucleotide sequence is from the middle of an ORF, translating it in the correct reading frame should result in an amino acid sequence with no interruptions from stop codons (TAA, TAG, or TGA). The process involves reading the sequence in groups of three nucleotides, starting from the first, second, or third nucleotide to establish the three possible forward reading frames.\n\nThe nucleotide sequence is:\n`ggacattgttgttagcgaagacttgaatggaacggtgaagttttcaagctctttaccctaccccaataatcttaacagtgtcctggctgagcgactggagaagtggc`\n\nThe three possible reading frames are:\n\n*   **Frame 1**: Starting from the 1st nucleotide (`g`):\n    `gga cat tgt tgt tag ...`\n    This frame translates to `G C C C *...` (where * is a stop codon). The fifth codon, `tag`, is a stop codon, which contradicts the fact that the sequence is from the middle of an ORF.\n\n*   **Frame 2**: Starting from the 2nd nucleotide (`g`):\n    `gac att gtt gtt agc gaa gac ttg aat gga acg gtg aag ttt tca agc tct tta ccc tac ccc aat aat ctt aac agt gtc ctg gct gag cga ctg gag aag tgg c`\n    This frame translates to a continuous sequence of amino acids with no stop codons.\n\n*   **Frame 3**: Starting from the 3rd nucleotide (`a`):\n    `aca ttg ttg tta gcg aag act tga ...`\n    This frame translates to `T L L L A K T *...` (where * is a stop codon). The eighth codon, `tga`, is a stop codon, which also contradicts the given information.\n\nTherefore, Frame 2 is the correct reading frame.\n\n**Frame:** Frame 2\n**Protein Sequence:**\n<<<DIVVVSEDLNGTVKFSSSLPYPNNLNSVLPAERLEKW>>>"
