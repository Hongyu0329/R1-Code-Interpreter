    "There are four wallpaper groups with a point group of order 2.\n\nThe crystallographic point groups are the symmetry groups of a crystal lattice that leave at least one point fixed. For a two-dimensional plane, these are also known as rosette groups. The order of a group is the number of elements it contains. The point groups of order 2 are C₂ and D₁.\n\nThe 17 wallpaper groups are classified by their symmetry elements, which in turn determine their point group. The wallpaper groups that have a point group of order 2 are:\n\n*   **p2**: This group has 2-fold rotational symmetry, and its point group is C₂.\n*   **pm**: This group has reflection symmetry across parallel lines. Its point group is D₁.\n*   **pg**: This group's symmetries include glide reflections. The corresponding point group, which considers only the rotational and reflectional symmetries at a point, is D₁.\n*   **cm**: This group also has reflection symmetry and its point group is D₁.\n\nTherefore, there are a total of four wallpaper groups with a point group of order 2.\n\n<<<4>>>"
