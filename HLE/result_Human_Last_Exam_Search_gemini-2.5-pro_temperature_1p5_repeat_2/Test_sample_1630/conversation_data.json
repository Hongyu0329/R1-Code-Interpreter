    "Let's analyze the problem. We need to find the maximum number of fixed points for the function $h(x) = f(g(x))$, where $f$ and $g$ are cubic polynomials. A fixed point is a solution to the equation $h(x) = x$.\n\n1.  **Degree of the polynomial:**\n    *   Since $f$ and $g$ are both polynomials of degree 3, their composition, $h(x) = f(g(x))$, is a polynomial of degree $3 \\times 3 = 9$.\n    *   The fixed points are the roots of the equation $f(g(x)) - x = 0$. This is a polynomial equation of degree 9.\n    *   According to the fundamental theorem of algebra, a polynomial of degree $n$ has at most $n$ real roots. Therefore, the equation $f(g(x)) - x = 0$ can have at most 9 real roots. This means $f(g(x))$ can have a maximum of 9 fixed points.\n\n2.  **Constraints on the polynomials:**\n    *   We are given that the derivatives, $f'(x)$ and $g'(x)$, are positive for all real numbers $x$.\n    *   Let $f(x) = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d$. Then $f'(x) = 3ax^2 + 2bx + c$. For $f'(x) > 0$ for all $x$, we must have the leading coefficient $3a > 0$ (so $a > 0$) and the discriminant must be negative: $(2b)^2 - 4(3a)(c) < 0$, which simplifies to $b^2 < 3ac$.\n    *   Similarly, if $g(x) = px^3 + qx^2 + rx + s$, then for $g'(x) > 0$ we need $p > 0$ and $q^2 < 3pr$.\n    *   These conditions mean that both $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are strictly increasing functions.\n\n3.  **Analysis of the composite function:**\n    *   Let $h(x) = f(g(x))$. The derivative of the composite function is $h'(x) = f'(g(x)) \\cdot g'(x)$.\n    *   Since $f'(y) > 0$ for any value $y$, and $g(x)$ can take any real value, $f'(g(x))$ is always positive.\n    *   Since $g'(x)$ is always positive, the product $h'(x) = f'(g(x)) \\cdot g'(x)$ is also always positive.\n    *   This implies that $h(x) = f(g(x))$ is a strictly increasing function.\n\n4.  **Finding the number of fixed points:**\n    *   We are looking for the number of solutions to $h(x) = x$. Graphically, this corresponds to the number of intersection points between the graph of the strictly increasing function $y = h(x)$ and the line $y = x$.\n    *   To analyze the number of roots of $h(x) - x = 0$, let's consider the function $k(x) = h(x) - x$. The roots of $k(x)$ are the fixed points of $h(x)$.\n    *   The derivative is $k'(x) = h'(x) - 1 = f'(g(x))g'(x) - 1$.\n    *   For $k(x)$ to have multiple roots, its derivative $k'(x)$ must change sign. This means $k'(x)$ must be able to take both positive and negative values.\n    *   $k'(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 8, since $f'(g(x))$ has degree $2 \\times 3 = 6$ and $g'(x)$ has degree 2.\n    *   A polynomial of degree 8 can have at most 8 real roots. These roots correspond to the critical points of $k(x)$.\n    *   If $k'(x)$ has 8 distinct real roots, then $k(x)$ can have at most $8+1=9$ real roots.\n    *   Since $k(x) = f(g(x)) - x$ is a polynomial of degree 9, and the leading coefficient is positive ($ap^3 > 0$), we have $k(x) \\to -\\infty$ as $x \\to -\\infty$ and $k(x) \\to +\\infty$ as $x \\to \\infty$.\n    *   To achieve 9 roots, the graph of $k(x)$ must have 4 local maxima that are positive and 4 local minima that are negative. This is possible for a general polynomial of degree 9.\n\nThe conditions $f'(x) > 0$ and $g'(x) > 0$ do not preclude the existence of 9 fixed points. We have established that the problem is equivalent to finding the maximum number of real roots of a specific type of degree 9 polynomial. As a general polynomial of degree 9 can have 9 real roots, and there are no obvious constraints from the properties of $f$ and $g$ that would limit this number below 9, the maximum number is 9. It is possible to construct such polynomials $f$ and $g$ where $f(g(x)) - x = 0$ has 9 real solutions.\n\n<<<9>>>"
