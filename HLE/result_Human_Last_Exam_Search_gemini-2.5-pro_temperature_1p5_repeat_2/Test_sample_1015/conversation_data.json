    "A defining difference between a cambré derrière in the Vaganova and Balanchine methods lies in the placement and use of the hips.\n\nIn the Vaganova method, a strong emphasis is placed on maintaining a stable and \"square\" torso and hip alignment throughout the movement. The backbend, or cambré, is initiated from the upper back, while the hips are meant to remain steady to avoid displacement. This adherence to a strict alignment of the shoulders and hips is a core principle of the technique.\n\nConversely, the Balanchine method is known for a more neoclassical and athletic approach, which often involves breaking the traditional \"box\" of the squared torso and hips to create dynamic lines. A notable characteristic of the Balanchine style is the use of an open hip in arabesque to achieve a longer, more extended look. This principle extends to other movements, including the cambré derrière, where the hips may be used more freely, sometimes described as \"swaying,\" to create a specific aesthetic. Therefore, the Balanchine technique allows for the hip to be less fixed than in the Vaganova method.\n\nWhile arm and head placement are specific in both techniques, and Balanchine is known for speed, the fundamental difference in the execution of a cambré derrière is rooted in the divergent philosophies on hip placement. The degree of the backbend is more dependent on an individual dancer's flexibility rather than a stylistic requirement of either method.\n\n<<<B>>>"
