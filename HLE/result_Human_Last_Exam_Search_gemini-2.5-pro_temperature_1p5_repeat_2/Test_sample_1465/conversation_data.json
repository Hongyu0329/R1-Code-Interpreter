    "Based on established principles of coiled-coil design, the oligomeric state of these protein sequences can be predicted by analyzing the amino acid residues at the core 'a' and 'd' positions of the heptad repeat (`abcdefg`).\n\n1.  **EIAQALKEIAKALKEIAWALKEIAQALK**: The residues at the 'a' positions are consistently Alanine (A), and at the 'd' positions are predominantly Leucine (L). This combination of a small hydrophobic residue at 'a' and a larger one at 'd' is a known design principle for forming **dimers**.\n\n2.  **EIAALKQEIAALKKENAALKQEIAALKQ**: This sequence also features Alanine at all 'a' positions and primarily Leucine at the 'd' positions, with a single polar Asparagine (N) substitution. This pattern is characteristic of a **dimer**.\n\n3.  **EIAAIKQEIAAIKKEIAAIKWEIAAIKQ**: Here, the 'a' positions are occupied by Alanine, while the 'd' positions are occupied by Isoleucine (I), with one Tryptophan (W). The combination of Isoleucine at the 'd' positions with another hydrophobic residue at the 'a' position is a well-established motif for promoting the formation of **tetramers**.\n\n4.  **EIQKQLKEIQKQLKEIQWQLKEIQKQLK**: This sequence has polar Glutamine (Q) residues at the 'a' positions and Leucine at the 'd' positions. The presence of a consistent hydrophobic residue like Leucine at the 'd' position strongly directs the structure, and in this context, it favors a **dimer**.\n\n5.  **EIAQTLKEIAKTLKEIAWTLKEIAQTLK**: This sequence has Leucine residues consistently at the 'd' positions. The 'a' positions are varied, including polar (Q) and charged (K) residues. The pattern of consistent Leucine at 'd' with varied 'a' positions is a feature used in the design of **trimers**.\n\nTherefore, the predicted oligomeric states for the given sequences are 2, 2, 4, 2, and 3.\n\n<<<D>>>"
