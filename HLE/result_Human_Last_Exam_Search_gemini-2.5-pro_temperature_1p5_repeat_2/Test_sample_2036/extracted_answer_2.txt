In practice, the most critical factor is ensuring the aircraft on the circling approach is in a position where it will not conflict with the departure path of Runway 30. A distance of approximately 4.2 nautical miles, corresponding to the edge of the PANS-OPS circling area for a Category C aircraft, from the threshold of Runway 12 would place the aircraft on the boundary of the protected area. To ensure separation with a departing aircraft from Runway 30, whose flight path would be to the northwest, the arriving aircraft would need to be established on the southern or eastern portion of its circling pattern, away from the departure corridor. There is no single mileage from the VOR that can be universally applied; however, ensuring the arriving aircraft is at least 3 nautical miles from the departure's flight path is the overriding requirement. Based on the geometry of the airport, for a takeoff from runway 30, the circling aircraft would need to be south of the airport, established on its downwind for runway 12. A common technique is to use visual reporting points or to ensure the aircraft is past the extended centerline of the departure runway. A definitive mileage from the VOR is not the primary separation tool in this dynamic situation.
