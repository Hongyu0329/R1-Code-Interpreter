    "### Wilson-Fisher Fixed Point Coupling in $\\phi^4$ Theory\n\nIn the framework of the renormalization group (RG) applied to the $\\phi^4$ scalar field theory near four spatial dimensions, the behavior of the system is governed by the RG flow of the coupling constant, denoted as $u$. The change of this coupling with respect to the energy scale is described by the beta function, $\\beta(u)$. A fixed point, $u^*$, of this flow is a value of the coupling for which the beta function is zero, meaning the coupling constant ceases to change with the energy scale.\n\nThe Wilson-Fisher fixed point is a non-trivial (i.e., non-zero) infrared fixed point that controls the critical behavior of the theory in dimensions $d = 4 - \\epsilon$, where $\\epsilon$ is a small positive parameter. To find the leading order expression for this fixed point coupling, one calculates the one-loop beta function for the dimensionless coupling $u$.\n\nThe one-loop beta function for the coupling $u$ in the $\\phi^4$ theory is given by:\n$\\beta(u) = -\\epsilon u + \\frac{3}{16\\pi^2} u^2 + O(u^3)$\n\nSetting the beta function to zero, $\\beta(u^*) = 0$, allows us to solve for the fixed point coupling $u^*$:\n$-\\epsilon u^* + \\frac{3}{16\\pi^2} (u^*)^2 = 0$\n\nThis equation has two solutions. The first is the trivial Gaussian fixed point, $u^* = 0$. The second, non-trivial solution is the Wilson-Fisher fixed point. Factoring out $u^*$, we get:\n$u^* (-\\epsilon + \\frac{3}{16\\pi^2} u^*) = 0$\n\nSolving for the non-zero root gives the leading order expression for the fixed point coupling:\n$u^* = \\frac{16\\pi^2}{3} \\epsilon$\n\nThis result is valid to the leading order in the $\\epsilon$ expansion. It's important to note that different conventions for the definition of the coupling constant can lead to different numerical prefactors in the expression for the beta function and consequently for the fixed point coupling. For instance, using a coupling `v` defined differently, the beta function can be expressed as $\\beta(v) = \\epsilon v - \\frac{3}{2} v^2$, which leads to a fixed point at $v^* = \\frac{2}{3}\\epsilon$. The physically relevant quantities, such as critical exponents, are independent of these conventions.\n\n<<<The leading order expression for the fixed point coupling $u^*$ in the $\\phi^4$ theory near four dimensions in terms of $\\epsilon = 4-d$ is $u^* = \\frac{16\\pi^2}{3} \\epsilon$.>>>"
