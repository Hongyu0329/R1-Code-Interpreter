In the theoretical framework of planar Birkhoff billiard dynamics, the generating function H(s,s′) that encapsulates the billiard map's symplectic structure is given by the negative of the Euclidean distance between the boundary points parameterized by the arc-lengths s and s', i.e., H(s,s′) = -||γ(s') - γ(s')||. An asymptotic analysis in the limit as the arc-length separation |s′−s| approaches zero reveals the influence of the boundary's local curvature κ(s). The leading-order behavior of H(s,s′) is characterized by the expansion:

H(s,s′) = -|s′−s| + (κ(s)² / 24) * |s′−s|³ + O(|s′−s|⁴)

The leading term, -|s′−s|, signifies that for infinitesimal separations, the generating function approximates the negative of the arc-length distance. The first and most significant correction term, (κ(s)²/24)|s′−s|³, elucidates the nuanced interplay between the boundary's geometry and the system's dynamics. This term is cubic in the separation and proportional to the square of the local curvature. It demonstrates that a higher curvature induces a larger deviation of the chord length from the arc length for a given small step, which in turn more strongly influences the action functional that governs the billiard trajectories in this near-grazing asymptotic regime. This highlights how geometric curvature effects are fundamentally embedded within the symplectic description of the billiard system's dynamical properties.
