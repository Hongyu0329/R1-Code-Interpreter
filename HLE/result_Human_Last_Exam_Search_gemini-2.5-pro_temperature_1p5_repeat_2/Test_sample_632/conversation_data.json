    "**A Unique Architectural Feature Removed from Piazza della Rotonda**\n\nUntil the late 19th century, the Piazza della Rotonda in Rome, famous for the Pantheon, had a distinctive and much-debated architectural feature: a pair of twin bell towers flanking the top of the Pantheon's portico. These were removed in 1883, not 1950 as is sometimes mistakenly believed.\n\nThe bell towers, often erroneously attributed to the famed Baroque artist Gian Lorenzo Bernini, were actually added in the 17th century under Pope Urban VIII. Their purpose was to give the ancient pagan temple, which had been converted into the church of Santa Maria ad Martyres, a more church-like appearance.\n\nHowever, the addition was not well-received by the Roman populace, who bestowed upon the towers the unflattering nickname \"the ass's ears.\" For over two centuries, these towers were a prominent, if criticized, feature of the Roman skyline.\n\nIn the late 1800s, as part of an effort to restore the Pantheon to a semblance of its original classical appearance, the decision was made to demolish the controversial bell towers. This removal was one of several alterations made to the piazza and the Pantheon over the centuries, which also included the clearing of medieval shops and sheds from the front of the monument and the addition of the central fountain and obelisk.\n\nWhile other demolitions and urban planning projects have affected the area around the Pantheon, the removal of the \"ass's ears\" remains the most significant and well-documented case of a unique architectural feature being permanently taken away from the immediate vicinity of the Piazza della Rotonda.\n\n<<<The twin bell towers on the Pantheon>>>"
