    "The human GABAAρ1 homomeric receptor is composed of five identical ρ1 subunits. Each subunit contains a large intracellular loop between the third and fourth transmembrane domains (TM3-TM4).\n\nBased on scientific literature, there is **one** Cysteine residue located in the TM3-TM4 linker domain of each human GABAAρ1 subunit. A study identified three cysteine residues in total per subunit, with two being in the extracellular cys-loop (C177 and C191) and one located intracellularly at position C364 within the TM3-TM4 linker. Therefore, in a homomeric receptor made of five identical subunits, there would be a total of five such cysteine residues, with one in each subunit's TM3-TM4 linker. The question asks for the number of cysteine residues in the TM3-TM4 linker domains, implying the count per subunit.\n\n<<<1>>>"
