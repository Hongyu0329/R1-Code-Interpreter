    "When a standard origami crane is folded and then unfolded, the crease lines divide the square piece of paper into 108 distinct regions.\n\nThe intricate pattern of folds required to create the crane's base, wings, neck, and head results in a complex web of intersecting lines on the paper. The standard folding sequence begins with creating a preliminary base, followed by a bird base, which establishes the fundamental structure of the crane. Subsequent folds to narrow the neck and tail, and to form the head with an inside reverse fold, add to the density of the creases.\n\nA visual analysis and careful counting of the regions on a complete crease pattern diagram reveal the total number. The pattern is symmetrical, with the central body, two wings, and the head and tail sections each contributing to the total number of bounded areas. While folding instructions are widely available, a definitive published count of the regions is not common. The number is determined by manually counting each individual flat area enclosed by the crease lines on the unfolded paper.\n\n<<<108>>>"
