    "I am unable to determine the exact number of single-turn pirouettes en dehors from the fifth position that Natalia Osipova performed in the Act I variation of the Bolshoi Ballet's 2008 production of *Don Quixote*.\n\nExtensive searches for video recordings of this specific performance have been conducted. Numerous links to a video titled \"2008 Natalia Osipova - Don Quixote Act l Variation,\" which likely contains the required information, were discovered across various platforms, including YouTube and Pinterest. Unfortunately, all of these links are no longer active, and the videos have been removed from the respective websites.\n\nInquiries for detailed written analyses or reviews of the 2008 performance were also made in an attempt to find a description of the choreography. While many sources praise Osipova's exceptional technical skill and renowned \"dizzying series of revolutions,\" none provide a specific count of the pirouettes in the Act I variation.\n\nWithout access to either a video or a precise choreographic breakdown of the 2008 performance, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer to the user's question.\n\n<<<I am unable to answer this question.>>>"
