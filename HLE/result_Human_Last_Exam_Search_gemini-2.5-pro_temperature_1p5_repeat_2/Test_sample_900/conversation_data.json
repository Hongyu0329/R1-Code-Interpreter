    "## The specific number of \"pas de Balanchines\" performed by Svetlana Gileva in the Jete Woman solo of William Forsythe's \"In the Middle, Somewhat Elevated\" with the Semperoper Ballett in 2015 cannot be determined.\n\nDespite a thorough search for video documentation and written analysis of Svetlana Gileva's performance, the required visual evidence to count the specific ballet steps is unavailable. While several sources confirm Ms. Gileva danced the role of the Jete Woman with the Semperoper Ballett in 2015, including production listings and reviews, the videos of this particular solo are no longer accessible.\n\nCritical reviews of the Semperoper Ballett's performances of \"In the Middle, Somewhat Elevated\" praise Svetlana Gileva's interpretation of the role, highlighting her powerful technique and stage presence. For instance, a 2018 review of a London performance described her technique as having \"the clarity of cut crystal\" and noted how she \"injects ecstasy into the Vaganova textbook\". Another review from the same year mentioned that her \"huge jump arrives in midair with photosharp precision\". However, these descriptions do not provide a detailed breakdown of the choreography that would allow for an accurate count of a specific step like the \"pas de Balanchine.\"\n\nPhotographs from the 2015 production confirm Svetlana Gileva in the role, but static images are insufficient for the user's specific request. Without a viewable video of the Jete Woman solo from the 2015 Semperoper Ballett production, any attempt to quantify the number of \"pas de Balanchines\" would be speculative.\n\n<<<Unable to provide a number as video evidence is not available.>>>"
