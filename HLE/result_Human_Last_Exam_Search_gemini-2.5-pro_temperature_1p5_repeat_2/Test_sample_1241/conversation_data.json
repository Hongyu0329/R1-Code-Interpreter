    "To find the value of $P_{0}(+\\infty) + P_{1}(+\\infty)$, we need to analyze the steady-state behavior of the system. In the steady state, as $t \\to +\\infty$, the probabilities $P_i(t)$ approach constant values, which we denote as $p_i$. This implies that their time derivatives, $P_i'(t)$, approach zero.\n\nThe given system of differential equations thus transforms into a system of linear algebraic equations:\n1.  $0 = -0.019 p_0 + 0.65 p_1$\n2.  $0 = 0.019 p_0 - (0.65 + 0.4) p_1 + 0.392 p_2 + 0.008 p_3$\n3.  $0 = 0.4 p_1 - (0.392 + 0.008) p_2$\n4.  $0 = 0.008 p_2 - 0.008 p_3$\n\nAdditionally, the sum of all probabilities must equal 1:\n5.  $p_0 + p_1 + p_2 + p_3 = 1$\n\nWe can solve this system of equations.\n\nFrom equation (4):\n$0.008 p_2 = 0.008 p_3 \\implies p_2 = p_3$\n\nFrom equation (3):\n$0.4 p_1 = (0.392 + 0.008) p_2$\n$0.4 p_1 = 0.4 p_2 \\implies p_1 = p_2$\n\nCombining these results, we get:\n$p_1 = p_2 = p_3$\n\nFrom equation (1):\n$0.019 p_0 = 0.65 p_1 \\implies p_0 = \\frac{0.65}{0.019} p_1$\n\nNow, we substitute these relationships into the normalization equation (5):\n$p_0 + p_1 + p_2 + p_3 = 1$\n$\\left(\\frac{0.65}{0.019}\\right) p_1 + p_1 + p_1 + p_1 = 1$\n$\\left(\\frac{0.65}{0.019} + 3\\right) p_1 = 1$\n\nTo find the value of $p_1$:\n$p_1 \\left(\\frac{0.65 + 3 \\times 0.019}{0.019}\\right) = 1$\n$p_1 \\left(\\frac{0.65 + 0.057}{0.019}\\right) = 1$\n$p_1 \\left(\\frac{0.707}{0.019}\\right) = 1$\n$p_1 = \\frac{0.019}{0.707}$\n\nNow we can calculate $p_0$:\n$p_0 = \\frac{0.65}{0.019} p_1 = \\frac{0.65}{0.019} \\times \\frac{0.019}{0.707} = \\frac{0.65}{0.707}$\n\nThe quantity we need to find is $p_0 + p_1$:\n$p_0 + p_1 = \\frac{0.65}{0.707} + \\frac{0.019}{0.707} = \\frac{0.65 + 0.019}{0.707} = \\frac{0.669}{0.707}$\n\nFinally, we perform the division:\n$\\frac{0.669}{0.707} \\approx 0.946251768$\n\n<<<0.946251768>>>"
