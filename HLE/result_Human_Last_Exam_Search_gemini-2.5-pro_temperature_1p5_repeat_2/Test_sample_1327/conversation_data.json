    "To find the number that should be filled in the parentheses for the sequence 2, 11, 23, 51, 119, we need to identify the underlying pattern.\n\nLet's examine the relationship between consecutive terms:\n*   The first term is **2**.\n*   The second term is **11**. This can be written as (2 * 2) + 7.\n*   The third term is **23**. This can be written as (11 * 2) + 1.\n*   The fourth term is **51**. This can be written as (23 * 2) + 5.\n*   The fifth term is **119**. This can be written as (51 * 2) + 17.\n\nAnother more consistent pattern emerges if we relate each term to a power of two:\n*   2 = 2¹\n*   11 = 2³ + 3\n*   23 = 2⁴ + 7\n*   51 = 2⁵ + 19\n*   119 = 2⁶ + 55\n\nLet's analyze the numbers added to the power of two (3, 7, 19, 55). If we look at the differences between these numbers:\n*   7 - 3 = 4\n*   19 - 7 = 12\n*   55 - 19 = 36\n\nWe can see a clear pattern in these differences: they are being multiplied by 3 (4 * 3 = 12, and 12 * 3 = 36). Following this logic, the next difference should be 36 * 3 = 108.\n\nTo find the next number to add to the power of two, we add this new difference to the last added number: 55 + 108 = 163.\n\nThe next term in the main sequence would therefore be based on 2⁷:\nNext Term = 2⁷ + 163\nNext Term = 128 + 163\nNext Term = 291\n\n<<<A>>>"
