    "The man Andrei Voznesensky called \"a joy-discovering sailor\" was the Russian nobleman and explorer Nikolai Petrovich Rezanov.\n\nVoznesensky's famous rock opera, \"Juno and Avos,\" immortalized the tragic love story of Rezanov and Concepción Argüello. Rezanov died of fever and exhaustion in Krasnoyarsk, Siberia, in 1807. His original grave was destroyed by the Bolsheviks. For a long time, the exact location of his remains was uncertain. A monument erected in 1831 was destroyed in the 1930s, and there are accounts that his remains were moved in the late 1950s. This uncertainty answers Voznesensky's poetic question, \"Where is your grave, even a mound?\".\n\nThe answer to the question of his final resting place began to emerge in the late 20th century, culminating in the dedication of a new memorial on October 28, 2000, at the Trinity churchyard in Krasnoyarsk, which is believed to hold his remains. The memorial's cross is inscribed with lines from Voznesensky's \"Juno and Avos\".\n\n<<<Rezanov>>>"
