    "To find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $N = 36036$ and order 6, we first need to factorize the conductor $N$.\n$N = 36036 = 36 \\times 1001 = 6^2 \\times 7 \\times 11 \\times 13 = 2^2 \\times 3^2 \\times 7 \\times 11 \\times 13$.\n\nA Dirichlet character $\\chi$ with conductor $N = p_1^{a_1} \\cdots p_r^{a_r}$ is primitive if and only if it can be uniquely decomposed into a product of primitive characters $\\chi_i$ with conductor $p_i^{a_i}$:\n$\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\chi_3 \\chi_4 \\chi_5$, where\n*   $\\chi_1$ is a primitive character modulo $2^2 = 4$.\n*   $\\chi_2$ is a primitive character modulo $3^2 = 9$.\n*   $\\chi_3$ is a primitive character modulo $7$.\n*   $\\chi_4$ is a primitive character modulo $11$.\n*   $\\chi_5$ is a primitive character modulo $13$.\n\nThe order of the character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of the component characters:\n$\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_1), \\text{ord}(\\chi_2), \\text{ord}(\\chi_3), \\text{ord}(\\chi_4), \\text{ord}(\\chi_5))$.\n\nWe are looking for characters of order 6. This means we require:\n$\\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_1), \\text{ord}(\\chi_2), \\text{ord}(\\chi_3), \\text{ord}(\\chi_4), \\text{ord}(\\chi_5)) = 6$.\n\nLet's determine the possible orders for each primitive character $\\chi_i$. The order of a character modulo $M$ must divide the order of the group $(\\mathbb{Z}/M\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$, which is $\\phi(M)$.\n\n1.  **Characters modulo 4**: The group of characters modulo 4 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_2$. There is one primitive character modulo 4, and its order is 2. So, for $\\chi_1$, there is 1 choice, and its order is $o_1=2$.\n\n2.  **Characters modulo 9**: The group of characters modulo 9 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/9\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_{\\phi(9)} = C_6$. The number of primitive characters is $\\phi(9) - \\phi(3) = 6 - 2 = 4$. The orders of elements in $C_6$ are 1, 2, 3, 6. The non-primitive characters are those induced from modulo 3, which have orders 1 and 2. Thus, the primitive characters modulo 9 must have orders 3 or 6. In a cyclic group of order 6, there are $\\phi(3)=2$ elements of order 3 and $\\phi(6)=2$ elements of order 6. So for $\\chi_2$, there are 2 characters of order 3 and 2 characters of order 6.\n\n3.  **Characters modulo 7**: The group of characters is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_6$. All non-principal characters are primitive. We need the order to divide 6. The number of such characters of order $d$ is $\\phi(d)$.\n    *   Order 2: $\\phi(2)=1$ character.\n    *   Order 3: $\\phi(3)=2$ characters.\n    *   Order 6: $\\phi(6)=2$ characters.\n    In total, there are $1+2+2=5$ choices for $\\chi_3$.\n\n4.  **Characters modulo 11**: The group of characters is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/11\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_{10}$. We need the order to divide 6. The only common divisor of 10 and 6 greater than 1 is 2. All non-principal characters are primitive. There is $\\phi(2)=1$ character of order 2. So for $\\chi_4$, there is 1 choice, and its order is $o_4=2$.\n\n5.  **Characters modulo 13**: The group of characters is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/13\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_{12}$. We need the order to divide 6. The divisors of 12 that also divide 6 are 2, 3, and 6. All are possible orders for primitive characters.\n    *   Order 2: $\\phi(2)=1$ character.\n    *   Order 3: $\\phi(3)=2$ characters.\n    *   Order 6: $\\phi(6)=2$ characters.\n    In total, there are $1+2+2=5$ choices for $\\chi_5$.\n\nNow we need to find the number of tuples of these characters $(\\chi_1, \\dots, \\chi_5)$ such that the lcm of their orders is 6.\nLet the orders be $(o_1, o_2, o_3, o_4, o_5)$. The possible orders for each character are:\n*   $o_1 = 2$\n*   $o_2 \\in \\{3, 6\\}$\n*   $o_3 \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$\n*   $o_4 = 2$\n*   $o_5 \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$\n\nFor the lcm to be 6, two conditions must be met:\n1.  The lcm must be a multiple of 2. This means at least one order $o_i$ must be divisible by 2.\n2.  The lcm must be a multiple of 3. This means at least one order $o_i$ must be divisible by 3.\n\nLet's check these conditions:\n1.  For any choice of characters, the order of $\\chi_1$ is $o_1=2$. Thus, the lcm of the orders will always be divisible by 2.\n2.  For any choice of characters, the order of $\\chi_2$ must be 3 or 6, both of which are divisible by 3. Thus, the lcm of the orders will always be divisible by 3.\n\nSince the lcm is always divisible by both 2 and 3, it is always divisible by 6. Furthermore, all possible orders are divisors of 6, so their lcm cannot be a multiple of a larger number. Therefore, the lcm of the orders for any valid combination of characters is exactly 6.\n\nThe problem then reduces to finding the total number of possible combinations of these primitive characters. We multiply the number of choices for each component character:\n*   Number of choices for $\\chi_1$ (order 2): 1.\n*   Number of choices for $\\chi_2$ (orders 3 or 6): $2 + 2 = 4$.\n*   Number of choices for $\\chi_3$ (orders 2, 3, or 6): $1 + 2 + 2 = 5$.\n*   Number of choices for $\\chi_4$ (order 2): 1.\n*   Number of choices for $\\chi_5$ (orders 2, 3, or 6): $1 + 2 + 2 = 5$.\n\nThe total number of such characters is the product of the number of choices for each component:\nTotal number = $1 \\times 4 \\times 5 \\times 1 \\times 5 = 100$.\n\n<<<100>>>"
