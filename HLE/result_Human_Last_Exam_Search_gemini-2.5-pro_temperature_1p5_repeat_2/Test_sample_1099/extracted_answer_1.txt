To simulate the correlations from a set of POVM measurements on a singlet bipartite quantum state using a local hidden variable model, the minimal resources required are, on average, either a specific amount of classical communication or the use of a non-signaling PR-Box. For classical communication, one trit is sufficient for general POVMs. Alternatively, a single non-signaling PR-Box is sufficient to simulate the correlations for all possible measurements.
