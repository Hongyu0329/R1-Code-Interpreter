    "**Radon was the rarest noble gas on Earth in 2002, with an abundance in the Earth's crust of approximately 4 x 10<sup>-13</sup> milligrams per kilogram.**\n\nOf the naturally occurring noble gases—helium, neon, argon, krypton, xenon, and radon—radon is the least abundant. Its extreme rarity is a result of its radioactivity; it has no stable isotopes and its longest-lived isotope, radon-222, has a half-life of only 3.8 days.\n\nThe abundances of the other noble gases in Earth's dry atmosphere are significantly higher:\n*   **Argon (Ar):** 0.934%\n*   **Neon (Ne):** 0.001818%\n*   **Helium (He):** 0.000524%\n*   **Krypton (Kr):** 0.000114%\n*   **Xenon (Xe):** 0.0000087%\n\nRadon is continuously formed from the radioactive decay of uranium and thorium in the Earth's crust. However, due to its short half-life, its concentration remains exceptionally low at any given time.\n\nAnother noble gas, oganesson, was first synthesized in 2002. However, as a synthetic element that does not occur naturally, it is not considered in the context of natural terrestrial abundance. Therefore, radon stands as the rarest naturally occurring noble gas on Earth.\n\n<<<Radon>>>"
