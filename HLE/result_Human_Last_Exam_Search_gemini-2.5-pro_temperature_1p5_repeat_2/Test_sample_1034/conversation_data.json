    "To determine the number of integer values for the side length AC for which there are two possible values for side length AB, we can use the Law of Sines and the ambiguous case (SSA).\n\nLet the sides of the triangle be $a$, $b$, and $c$ opposite to angles $A$, $B$, and $C$ respectively.\nWe are given:\n*   $a = BC = S$\n*   $\\mathrm{m} \\angle B = 30^{\\circ}$\n*   Let $b = AC$ be the side whose integer values we are counting.\n*   Let $c = AB$ be the side with two possible values.\n\nThe Law of Sines states:\n$\\frac{a}{\\sin A} = \\frac{b}{\\sin B}$\n\nSubstituting the known values:\n$\\frac{S}{\\sin A} = \\frac{b}{\\sin 30^{\\circ}}$\n\nFrom this, we can express $\\sin A$:\n$\\sin A = \\frac{S \\cdot \\sin 30^{\\circ}}{b} = \\frac{S \\cdot (1/2)}{b} = \\frac{S}{2b}$\n\nFor there to be two possible triangles, and thus two possible lengths for side AB, two conditions must be met for angle A:\n1.  There must be two possible values for angle A. This happens when $0 < \\sin A < 1$.\n2.  Both possible values of A must result in a valid triangle.\n\nLet's analyze the first condition:\n$0 < \\frac{S}{2b} < 1$\n\nSince S and b are side lengths, they are positive, so $\\frac{S}{2b} > 0$ is always true.\nThe second part of the inequality is $\\frac{S}{2b} < 1$, which simplifies to $S < 2b$, or $b > \\frac{S}{2}$.\n\nNow, let's analyze the second condition. If $0 < \\sin A < 1$, there are two possible angles for A: $A_1 = \\arcsin\\left(\\frac{S}{2b}\\right)$ and $A_2 = 180^{\\circ} - A_1$.\nFor the second triangle to be valid, the sum of its angles must be less than $180^{\\circ}$.\n$A_2 + B < 180^{\\circ}$\n$(180^{\\circ} - A_1) + B < 180^{\\circ}$\n$B < A_1$\n\nSince angle $B$ and $A_1$ are both acute, this inequality is equivalent to $\\sin B < \\sin A_1$:\n$\\sin 30^{\\circ} < \\frac{S}{2b}$\n$\\frac{1}{2} < \\frac{S}{2b}$\nThis simplifies to $b < S$.\n\nCombining the two conditions, for there to be two possible values for side AB, the length of side AC (which is $b$) must satisfy the inequality:\n$\\frac{S}{2} < b < S$\n\nThe problem asks for the number of *integer values* of $AC$ (or $b$) in this interval. The integers must be greater than $S/2$ and less than $S$.\nThe number of integers in this range can be calculated as:\nNumber of integers = (largest integer) - (smallest integer) + 1\n*   The largest possible integer value for $b$ is $S-1$ (assuming S is an integer).\n*   The smallest possible integer value for $b$ is $\\lfloor \\frac{S}{2} \\rfloor + 1$.\n\nSo, the number of integer values is $(S-1) - (\\lfloor \\frac{S}{2} \\rfloor + 1) + 1 = S - 1 - \\lfloor \\frac{S}{2} \\rfloor$.\n\nThis formula can be simplified:\n*   If $S$ is an even number, let $S = 2k$. The number is $2k - 1 - k = k - 1 = \\frac{S}{2} - 1$.\n*   If $S$ is an odd number, let $S = 2k+1$. The number is $(2k+1) - 1 - k = k = \\frac{S-1}{2}$.\n\nBoth of these cases can be expressed by the single formula $\\lfloor \\frac{S-1}{2} \\rfloor$.\n\nThe term $S = SNYWR$ stands for \"Substitute Number You Will Receive\", which implies its value is determined by a previous problem in a competition. Without this preceding information, a specific numerical answer cannot be calculated. The final answer must be expressed in terms of $S$.\n\n<<<floor((S-1)/2)>>>"
