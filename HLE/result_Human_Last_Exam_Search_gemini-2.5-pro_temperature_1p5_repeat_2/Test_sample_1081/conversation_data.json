    "The number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a reductive group $G$ of type $E_8$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is determined by the classification of these tori up to $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational conjugacy. This classification is given by the Galois cohomology set $H^1(\\text{Gal}(\\overline{\\mathbb{F}_q}/\\mathbb{F}_q), W)$, where $W$ is the Weyl group of $G$.\n\nFor a finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$, the Galois group is generated by the Frobenius endomorphism $F$. The cohomology set is therefore the set of $F$-conjugacy classes in the Weyl group $W$. An $F$-conjugacy class is an orbit of the action $w \\mapsto v \\cdot w \\cdot F(v)^{-1}$ for $v, w \\in W$.\n\nA key property of the Lie group of type $E_8$ is that its Dynkin diagram has no non-trivial automorphisms. This implies that any reductive group of type $E_8$ over a finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is a split group. For a split group, the action of the Frobenius endomorphism $F$ on the Weyl group $W$ is trivial.\n\nWhen the Frobenius action is trivial, the $F$-conjugacy classes are simply the standard conjugacy classes of the Weyl group $W$. Thus, the problem reduces to finding the number of conjugacy classes in the Weyl group of type $E_8$, denoted $W(E_8)$.\n\nThe number of conjugacy classes of the Weyl group $W(E_8)$ has been computed and is a known result in mathematics. There are 112 conjugacy classes in $W(E_8)$. Each of these conjugacy classes corresponds to a unique class of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori.\n\nTherefore, the exact number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a reductive group $G$ of type $E_8$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is 112.\n\n<<<112>>>"
