    "A power subgroup of a group G is a subgroup generated by the n-th powers of all elements of G for some positive integer n. For the generalized quaternion group of size 128, denoted Q128, we can determine the number of such distinct subgroups.\n\nThe generalized quaternion group Q128 is given by the presentation:\nQ_128 = < a, x | a^{64} = 1, x^2 = a^{32}, xax^{-1} = a^{-1} >\n\nThe elements of Q128 consist of elements of the form `a^i` for `0 ≤ i < 64` and `a^i * x` for `0 ≤ i < 64`.\n\nThe power subgroups, which we can denote as `G^n`, are generated by the set of all `g^n` where `g` is an element of Q128. We analyze these based on whether `n` is even or odd.\n\n**Case 1: `n` is an odd integer**\nWhen `n` is odd, the subgroup `G^n` is the entire group Q128 itself.\n*   The n-th powers of elements of the form `a^i` generate the cyclic subgroup `<a>`, because `n` and 64 are coprime.\n*   The n-th powers of elements of the form `a^i * x` include the element `x` (by choosing `i` appropriately).\nSince the generators `a` and `x` are in `G^n`, `G^n` must be the whole group Q128. This accounts for one power subgroup.\n\n**Case 2: `n` is an even integer**\nWhen `n` is an even integer, the subgroup `G^n` is a cyclic subgroup generated by a power of `a`. Specifically, `G^n` is equal to `<a^d>`, where `d` is the greatest common divisor of `n` and 64.\nThe possible values for `d = gcd(n, 64)` when `n` is even are the even divisors of 64. The divisors of 64 are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64. The even divisors are:\n*   2\n*   4\n*   8\n*   16\n*   32\n*   64\n\nEach of these even divisors corresponds to a distinct power subgroup:\n1.  `<a^2>`, a cyclic subgroup of order 32.\n2.  `<a^4>`, a cyclic subgroup of order 16.\n3.  `<a^8>`, a cyclic subgroup of order 8.\n4.  `<a^16>`, a cyclic subgroup of order 4.\n5.  `<a^32>`, a cyclic subgroup of order 2.\n6.  `<a^64>`, which is the trivial subgroup `{1}`.\n\nThis gives a total of 6 distinct subgroups for even values of `n`.\n\nCombining the results from both cases (odd and even `n`), the set of all distinct power subgroups of Q128 is {Q128, `<a^2>`, `<a^4>`, `<a^8>`, `<a^16>`, `<a^32>`, {1}}.\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 7 power subgroups in the generalized quaternion group of size 128.\n\n<<<7>>>"
