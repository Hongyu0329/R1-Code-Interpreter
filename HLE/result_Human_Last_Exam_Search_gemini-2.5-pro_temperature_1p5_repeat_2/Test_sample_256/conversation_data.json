    "The symmetry group of the best-known packing of 1135 congruent circles in a circle is C_1.\n\nThis information is based on the comprehensive catalogue of circle packings compiled by Eckard Specht, which provides data on the densest known packings for up to 2,600 circles. For a packing of 1135 circles, the listed symmetry group is C_1, indicating a lack of rotational or reflectional symmetry. The C_1 symmetry group, in Schoenflies notation, represents the lowest possible symmetry, containing only the identity operation.\n\n<<<C_1>>>"
