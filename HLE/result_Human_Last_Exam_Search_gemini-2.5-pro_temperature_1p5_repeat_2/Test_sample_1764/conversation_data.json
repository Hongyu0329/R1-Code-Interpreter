    "Let $X$ be a finite ultrametric space and $B$ be a Banach space of cardinality $K$. The smallest possible number of isometric embeddings of $X$ in $B$ can be 0, 1, or a number dependent on the structure of $X$ and $B$. The answer hinges on the properties of the Banach space $B$, which are constrained by its cardinality $K$, and on the notion of when two embeddings are considered distinct.\n\nAn isometric embedding is a map $f: X \\to B$ that preserves distances. Two embeddings, $f_1$ and $f_2$, are typically considered equivalent if there exists an isometry $\\phi: B \\to B$ of the Banach space onto itself such that $f_2 = \\phi \\circ f_1$. We are interested in the number of non-equivalent isometric embeddings.\n\n### Case 1: $B$ is an infinite-dimensional Banach space\n\nIt is a known result that any finite ultrametric space can be isometrically embedded into any infinite-dimensional Banach space. Let's assume such a Banach space $B$ exists with cardinality $K$.\n\nFor a finite ultrametric space $X$ with at least two points, its group of self-isometries, $\\text{Iso}(X)$, is non-trivial. If $f: X \\to B$ is one isometric embedding, then for any isometry $g \\in \\text{Iso}(X)$, the composition $f \\circ g$ produces another isometric embedding. The images $f(X)$ and $(f \\circ g)(X)$ are congruent finite metric spaces within $B$.\n\nIn many \"classical\" infinite-dimensional Banach spaces, such as Hilbert spaces ($L_2$) and $L_p$ spaces, the isometry group of the space is very rich. For an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space, any two finite congruent subsets are images of one another under an isometry of the entire space. This property is known as ultrahomogeneity for isometries of finite subspaces. Therefore, if $f_1$ and $f_2$ are two isometric embeddings of $X$ into such a Banach space, their images $f_1(X)$ and $f_2(X)$ are congruent and thus there exists an isometry $\\phi$ of the Banach space such that $f_2(X) = \\phi(f_1(X))$. This implies that all isometric embeddings are equivalent. In this scenario, the number of non-equivalent isometric embeddings is 1.\n\n### Case 2: The Banach space $B$ has a finite cardinality $K$\n\nIf the cardinality $K$ is finite, then $B$ must be a finite-dimensional vector space over a finite field. The existence of even a single isometric embedding is not guaranteed and depends on the specific metric structure of $X$ and the norm on $B$. For instance, the distances in $X$ (which are real numbers) would need to correspond to norms of vectors in a space where the norm is derived from a finite field, which presents foundational issues unless a specific non-Archimedean framework is assumed. If no isometric embedding exists for a given pair $(X, B)$, the number of embeddings is 0.\n\n### The \"Smallest Possible\" Number\n\nThe question asks for the *smallest possible* number of isometric embeddings. This phrasing invites us to consider the most accommodating circumstances for the existence of embeddings, which points towards Case 1. Since an isometric embedding is known to exist for any finite ultrametric space into any infinite-dimensional Banach space, the number of embeddings is at least one. In the context of standard, highly symmetric Banach spaces like Hilbert spaces, all these embeddings become equivalent. Therefore, the smallest possible number of non-equivalent isometric embeddings is 1.\n\nIf $X$ consists of a single point, there is trivially only one embedding up to translation. If $X$ is the empty set, there is only one embedding (the empty function). Assuming $X$ is a non-empty, finite ultrametric space, the smallest possible number of non-equivalent isometric embeddings into a suitable Banach space is 1.\n\n<<<1>>>"
