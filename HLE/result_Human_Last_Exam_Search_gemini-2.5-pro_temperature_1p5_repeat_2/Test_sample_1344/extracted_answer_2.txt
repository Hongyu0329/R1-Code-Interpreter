An optimal single-site catalyst for both efficient polyolefin polymerization and subsequent hydrogenolysis would consist of a Group IV metal, specifically **zirconium (Zr) or hafnium (Hf)**, supported on a **highly Brønsted acidic support like sulfated alumina (AlS)**. The active catalyst would be generated in-situ from an organometallic precursor, such as tetrabenzylzirconium or tetraneopentylzirconium.

For **olefin polymerization**, the organometallic precursor reacts with the acidic support to create a single-site cationic alkyl-metal complex, which is a potent initiator for olefin insertion and chain growth.

For **polyolefin hydrogenolysis**, the introduction of hydrogen gas at elevated temperatures would transform the active site into a metal hydride. This hydride species is highly effective in cleaving the carbon-carbon bonds of the polymer backbone through a mechanism involving σ-bond metathesis and β-alkyl elimination, resulting in short-chain saturated alkanes.

This combination of a Group IV metal and a strongly acidic support provides a "switchable" catalytic system where the function can be toggled between polymer synthesis and degradation by controlling the reaction atmosphere (presence or absence of H₂).
