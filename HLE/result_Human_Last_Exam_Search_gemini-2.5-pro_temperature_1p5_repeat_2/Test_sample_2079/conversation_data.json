    "I have been unable to identify the name of the judge of Bártfa (now Bardejov) in 1461. While my research confirms that the town had its own judicial rights and a town judge (\"városbíró\") during that period, the available online resources and historical documents do not specifically name the individual who held this position in that particular year.\n\nHistorical records, such as the \"Archives of the Free Royal Town of Bártfa\" (Bártfa szabad királyi város levéltára), likely contain this information, but these archives are not directly accessible through the performed searches. The search results do mention other town officials from different time periods, such as judge Andrew Rawber at the turn of the 16th century, but a definitive identification for the year 1461 remains elusive.\n\nTherefore, I cannot provide a name for the judge of Bártfa in 1461.\n\n<<<I am unable to answer this question.>>>"
