    "To solve this problem with the utmost memory efficiency, we need to minimize the amount of data stored in variables. The core of the problem is to compare two strings lexicographically, ignoring case.\n\n### Analysis of Memory Optimization\n\n1.  **Input Storage**: The problem provides two strings on separate lines. A program must read the first string entirely before it can access the second string. Therefore, at least the first string must be stored in memory. The maximum length is 100 characters, so we need a character array of size 101 to accommodate the string and its null terminator (`\\0`).\n2.  **Second String**: To save memory, we can avoid storing the second string in its entirety. Instead, we can read it one character at a time and compare it with the corresponding character of the already-stored first string.\n3.  **Variable Sizes**: In C, the memory usage for standard data types on most competitive programming platforms (which typically use a 32-bit or 64-bit architecture like Linux with GCC) is as follows:\n    *   `char`: 1 byte\n    *   `int`: 4 bytes\n    *   pointer: 4 bytes (on 32-bit systems) or 8 bytes (on 64-bit systems)\n\n### The Most Memory-Efficient C Program\n\nThe most efficient approach involves storing the first string and then processing the second string character-by-character. This avoids allocating a second buffer.\n\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <ctype.h>\n\n/**\n * This program compares two strings lexicographically, ignoring their case.\n * It is designed to be highly memory-efficient by only storing the first string\n * in a buffer and processing the second string one character at a time from\n * standard input.\n */\nint main() {\n    // A buffer to store the first input string. Its size is 101 to hold\n    // a maximum of 100 characters plus the null terminator.\n    char first_string[101];\n\n    // An index variable to iterate through the first_string.\n    int i = 0;\n\n    // A variable to hold characters read from the second string. It is of\n    // type int to correctly handle the End-Of-File (EOF) value, which is\n    // returned by getchar() at the end of input.\n    int second_char;\n\n    // Read the first string from standard input.\n    scanf(\"%s\", first_string);\n\n    // Consume the newline character left in the input buffer by scanf.\n    // This positions the input stream at the beginning of the second string.\n    getchar();\n\n    // Iterate through the first string until its end (the null terminator).\n    while (first_string[i] != '\\0') {\n        // Read the next character from the second string.\n        second_char = getchar();\n\n        // Compare the lowercase versions of the characters.\n        if (tolower((unsigned char)first_string[i]) < tolower((unsigned char)second_char)) {\n            printf(\"-1\\n\");\n            return 0; // The first string is smaller.\n        }\n        if (tolower((unsigned char)first_string[i]) > tolower((unsigned char)second_char)) {\n            printf(\"1\\n\");\n            return 0; // The second string is smaller.\n        }\n\n        // Move to the next character.\n        i++;\n    }\n\n    // If the loop finishes, the strings are equal.\n    printf(\"0\\n\");\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Calculation of Memory Usage (m)\n\nWe calculate the total memory (`m`) by summing the sizes of all variables declared in the `main` function:\n\n1.  **`char first_string[101]`**: An array of 101 characters.\n    *   Memory = 101 * `sizeof(char)` = 101 * 1 = 101 bytes.\n2.  **`int i`**: An integer variable used as a loop index.\n    *   Memory = `sizeof(int)` = 4 bytes.\n3.  **`int second_char`**: An integer variable to store the character from the second string read via `getchar()`.\n    *   Memory = `sizeof(int)` = 4 bytes.\n\nThe total memory `m` is the sum of the memory used by these variables.\n\nm = (memory for `first_string`) + (memory for `i`) + (memory for `second_char`)\nm = 101 + 4 + 4\nm = 109 bytes\n\n<<<109>>>"
