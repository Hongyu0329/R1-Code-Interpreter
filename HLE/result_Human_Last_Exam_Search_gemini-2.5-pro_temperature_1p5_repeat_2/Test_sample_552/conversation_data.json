    "In his 1905 paper on Brownian motion, titled \"On the Movement of Small Particles Suspended in Stationary Liquids Required by the Molecular-Kinetic Theory of Heat,\" Albert Einstein did not cite any lectures.\n\nThe paper, one of his four groundbreaking \"Annus Mirabilis\" papers published in the scientific journal *Annalen der Physik*, does not contain a formal bibliography or a list of references to other publications. While his work built upon the established principles of thermodynamics and the molecular-kinetic theory of heat, Einstein did not explicitly name or cite any specific lectures from other scientists within the text of this particular paper. This was not unusual for his papers from this period.\n\nTherefore, there is no record of Einstein citing any lectures in his seminal 1905 work on Brownian motion.\n\n<<<Albert Einstein did not cite any lectures in his 1905 paper on Brownian motion.>>>"
