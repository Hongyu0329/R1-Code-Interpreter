    "In the dwarf cuttlefish (*Sepia bandensis*), the brain regions that lie adjacent and posterior to the palliovisceral lobe are primarily the **posterior chromatophore lobes** and the **fin lobes**.\n\nThe palliovisceral lobe is a central component of the posterior subesophageal mass, a major division of the cuttlefish brain. This lobe is part of a larger functional group known as the palliovisceral lobe complex. Within this complex, several lobes are situated around the palliovisceral lobe.\n\nBased on 3D brain atlas reconstructions of the dwarf cuttlefish, the posterior chromatophore lobes and the fin lobes are located dorsally and posteriorly relative to the palliovisceral lobe. Specifically, visualizations from the brain atlas of *Sepia bandensis* show the palliovisceral lobe positioned ventrally, with the fin lobes and posterior chromatophore lobes situated above and behind it. This arrangement is consistent with descriptions in other *Sepia* species, where the fin lobes and posterior chromatophore lobes are described as being in the dorsal region of the posterior subesophageal mass.\n\nThe palliovisceral lobe itself is involved in controlling escape movements and the expulsion of ink. The adjacent posterior chromatophore lobes are responsible for controlling the chromatophores (color-changing cells) and papillae on the mantle, fin, and visceral mass, while the fin lobes control the movements of the fins. Other components of the palliovisceral lobe complex include the lateral ventral palliovisceral lobes and the vasomotor lobes. Additionally, the magnocellular lobes are also located within the posterior subesophageal mass.\n\n<<<The brain regions that lie adjacent posteriorly to the palliovisceral lobe in the dwarf cuttlefish are the posterior chromatophore lobes and the fin lobes."
