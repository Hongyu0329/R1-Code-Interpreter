    "On Isaac Newton's color circle, the musical note that corresponds to the range between the color produced when combining yellow and blue, and blue itself is G.\n\nWhen yellow and blue are mixed, the resulting color is green. Isaac Newton, in his work on optics, created a color circle where he associated the seven colors of the spectrum with the seven notes of a musical scale. The scale he used was the Dorian mode starting on the note D.\n\nThe correlation between the colors and the musical notes in Newton's system is as follows:\n*   Red - D\n*   Orange - E\n*   Yellow - F\n*   Green - G\n*   Blue - A\n*   Indigo - B\n*   Violet - C\n\nThe color produced by mixing yellow and blue is green. Therefore, the range on Newton's color circle between green and blue corresponds to the musical note G.\n\n<<<G>>>"
