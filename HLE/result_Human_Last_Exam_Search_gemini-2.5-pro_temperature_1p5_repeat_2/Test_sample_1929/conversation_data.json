    "**The reaction between butadiene and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene yields 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoro-3-vinylcyclobutane.**\n\nThis reaction is a [2+2] cycloaddition, a process where two molecules with double bonds react to form a four-membered ring. While the Diels-Alder reaction, a [4+2] cycloaddition, is common for conjugated dienes like butadiene, the presence of the halogen substituents on 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene favors a stepwise [2+2] pathway.\n\nThe reaction proceeds as follows: one of the double bonds of butadiene reacts with the double bond of 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene. This results in the formation of a cyclobutane ring. The remaining double bond from the butadiene becomes a vinyl group attached to the cyclobutane ring. The structure of the resulting product is 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoro-3-vinylcyclobutane. Research on the cycloaddition of 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethylene with various dienes confirms the formation of such [2+2] adducts.\n\n<<<1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoro-3-vinylcyclobutane"
