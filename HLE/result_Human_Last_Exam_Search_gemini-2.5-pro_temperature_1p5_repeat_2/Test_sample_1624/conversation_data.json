    "Yes, there is an upper bound on the cardinality of $X$. The cardinality of $X$ is at most the cardinality of the continuum, $2^{\\aleph_0}$.\n\nHere is a justification for this conclusion:\n\n1.  Let $U$ be the dense open subset of $X$. The condition that each point in $U$ has a neighborhood homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}$ means that $U$ is a 1-dimensional topological manifold.\n\n2.  Since $U$ is a subspace of a metric space $X$, $U$ itself is a metrizable space. A metrizable manifold is second-countable, which means it has a countable basis for its topology.\n\n3.  A topological space with a countable basis is separable, meaning it contains a countable dense subset. Let's call this countable dense subset of $U$ by the name $D$.\n\n4.  We are given that $U$ is dense in $X$. Since $D$ is dense in $U$, and $U$ is dense in $X$, it follows that $D$ is dense in $X$.\n\n5.  Therefore, $X$ is a separable metric space, as it contains a countable dense subset $D$.\n\n6.  Every separable metric space has a cardinality of at most $2^{\\aleph_0}$, the cardinality of the continuum. This can be shown by constructing an injective map from the space into the set of real-valued functions on the countable dense set, which has cardinality $(2^{\\aleph_0})^{\\aleph_0} = 2^{\\aleph_0}$.\n\n7.  Furthermore, since $X$ is a connected metric space with more than one point (which it must be to contain an open subset homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}$), its cardinality must be at least $2^{\\aleph_0}$.\n\nCombining these points, the cardinality of $X$ is exactly $2^{\\aleph_0}$. Therefore, an upper bound on the cardinality of $X$ is the cardinality of the continuum.\n\n<<<Yes, the cardinality of the continuum, $2^{\\aleph_0}$.>>>"
