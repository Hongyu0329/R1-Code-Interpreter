    "While it is a fundamental principle that optical activity is a property of chiral substances, which by definition lack roto-inversion symmetry elements like mirror planes and centers of inversion, there are specific instances where achiral crystal classes can exhibit optical rotation. This phenomenon occurs in what are known as non-enantiomorphous crystal classes.\n\nThe crystal classes that are achiral and can still display optical activity are:\n*   **m**\n*   **mm2**\n*   **4 (S₄)**\n*   **42m (D₂d)**\n\nHere is a breakdown of the concepts:\n\n*   **Optical Activity:** This is the rotation of the plane of polarized light as it passes through a material. It is most commonly associated with chiral molecules and crystal structures. The absence of a center of symmetry is a key requirement for a crystal to exhibit optical activity.\n\n*   **Chiral vs. Achiral:** Chiral structures lack improper rotation axes (such as mirror planes or a center of inversion) and cannot be superimposed on their mirror image. Achiral structures possess at least one improper rotation axis. All 11 enantiomorphic crystal classes are chiral and demonstrate optical activity.\n\n*   **Non-polar Crystal Classes:** These classes do not have a unique polar axis.\n\n*   **Non-enantiomorphous Optically Active Crystals:** While chirality is the common prerequisite for optical activity, theoretical work dating back to J. Willard Gibbs predicted that certain achiral (non-enantiomorphous) crystal classes could also rotate polarized light. This has been experimentally verified in materials like silver thiogallate (AgGaS₂) and cadmium gallium sulfide (CdGa₂S₄), which belong to the 42m and 4 crystal classes, respectively. In the mm2 class, sodium nitrite (NaNO₂) has been shown to be optically active. For these achiral classes, optical activity is typically observed along specific directions where the effect is not overshadowed by strong birefringence (double refraction).\n\nTherefore, despite the general rule linking chirality and optical activity, four specific achiral, non-enantiomorphous crystal classes possess the correct symmetry to exhibit this property.\n\n<<<m, mm2, 4, 42m>>>"
