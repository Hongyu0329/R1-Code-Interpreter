    "The first step of identifying the properties of the great icosahedron has been completed. The search results indicate that the great icosahedron is a non-convex polyhedron, one of the four Kepler-Poinsot polyhedra. It is composed of 20 intersecting triangular faces. Crucially, the search results also state that the convex hull of the great icosahedron is a regular icosahedron. The outer-hull of the great icosahedron would be its convex hull. A regular icosahedron has 20 triangular faces. Therefore, the minimal number of triangles needed for triangulating the outer-hull of the great icosahedron is the number of faces of its convex hull, which is a regular icosahedron. This appears to be 20. I believe I have sufficient information to answer the user's request.\n\nThe minimal number of triangles required to triangulate the outer-hull of the great icosahedron is 20.\n\nThe great icosahedron is a non-convex polyhedron, one of the four Kepler-Poinsot polyhedra, and is composed of 20 intersecting triangular faces. The outer-hull of a non-convex polyhedron is its convex hull. For the great icosahedron, its convex hull is a regular icosahedron.\n\nA regular icosahedron is a Platonic solid with 20 faces, all of which are equilateral triangles. Therefore, the \"visible\" surface from the outside, which is the surface of its convex hull, is already triangulated by these 20 faces.\n\n<<<20>>>"
