    "The Christian theologian who first developed specialized terminology to describe changes in the laws of nature, applicable to both the virgin birth of Jesus and the possible alterations in natural laws at the Fall, was **Augustine of Hippo** (354-430 C.E.).\n\nAugustine was the first to create a sophisticated philosophical framework to explain how events that appear contrary to nature could occur without suggesting that God's created order is inconsistent. He introduced specific concepts and terms to articulate this:\n\n*   ***Rationes Seminales*** **(Seminal Reasons):** Augustine proposed that at the moment of creation, God embedded \"seminal reasons\" or latent potentialities into the fabric of the natural world. These are not fully formed beings but the hidden causal principles for things that would emerge later in time. According to this view, miracles are not a violation of nature's order, but the activation by God of a potentiality that has been present since creation. This framework allows for unique events like the virgin birth, which Augustine saw as a notable miracle where Christ was born of a virgin to signify that His followers would be born of the virgin Church. It can also be applied to changes in the natural world after the Fall, where the \"curse\" on creation could be understood as an alteration in how these seminal reasons unfold, leading to things like pain in childbirth and the need to toil for food.\n\n*   ***Contra Quam Est Nota Natura*** **(Contrary to What is Known of Nature):** Augustine famously argued that a miracle (or \"portent\") is not *contra naturam* (contrary to nature), but *contra quam est nota natura* (contrary to what is *known* of nature). He reasoned that because the will of God is the true nature of any created thing, nothing that happens by God's will can be fundamentally contrary to nature. What we perceive as a violation of natural law is simply an event whose cause is hidden from our limited human understanding. This terminology distinguishes between the natural order as it truly exists in God's plan and the natural order as humans observe it.\n\nBy developing the concepts of *rationes seminales* and the principle of *contra quam est nota natura*, Augustine provided the earliest and a highly influential theological vocabulary for explaining apparent alterations to the laws of nature, fully applicable to miracles like the virgin birth and systemic changes to the natural order like those described in the account of the Fall.\n\n<<<Augustine of Hippo>>>"
