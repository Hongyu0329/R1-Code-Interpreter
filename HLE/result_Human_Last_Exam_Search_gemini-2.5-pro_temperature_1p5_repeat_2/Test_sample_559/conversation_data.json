    "To find the separatrix of the given system of differential equations, we first identify the equilibrium points and their stability. A separatrix is a curve in the phase plane that separates regions of different qualitative behavior, and they are typically associated with saddle points.\n\nThe system of differential equations is:\n$$d'(t)=2d^2(t)+(-3u(t)+5u^2(t))d(t)-u(t)(1-u(t))u^2(t)$$\n$$u'(t)=(u(t)-1)u^2(t)$$\n\n**1. Finding Equilibrium Points**\n\nEquilibrium points $(u, d)$ are found by setting both derivatives to zero:\n1.  $u'(t) = u^2(u-1) = 0$\n2.  $d'(t) = 2d^2 + (5u^2 - 3u)d - u^3(1-u) = 0$\n\nFrom the first equation, we get $u = 0$ or $u = 1$.\n\n*   **Case 1: u = 0**\n    Substituting into the second equation gives $2d^2 = 0$, so $d=0$. This gives the equilibrium point **(0, 0)**.\n\n*   **Case 2: u = 1**\n    Substituting into the second equation gives $2d^2 + (5-3)d - 0 = 0$, which simplifies to $2d^2 + 2d = 0$, or $2d(d+1)=0$. This gives $d=0$ or $d=-1$. We have two more equilibrium points: **(1, 0)** and **(1, -1)**.\n\n**2. Classifying the Equilibrium Points**\n\nWe analyze the Jacobian matrix of the system, $J(u,d)$, to classify these points.\nThe Jacobian is:\n$$ J(u, d) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial u} & \\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial d} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial d'}{\\partial u} & \\frac{\\partial d'}{\\partial d} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 3u^2 - 2u & 0 \\\\ (10u - 3)d - 3u^2 + 4u^3 & 4d + 5u^2 - 3u \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe eigenvalues are the diagonal entries: $\\lambda_1 = 3u^2 - 2u$ and $\\lambda_2 = 4d + 5u^2 - 3u$.\n\n*   At **(1, 0)**:\n    $\\lambda_1 = 3(1)^2 - 2(1) = 1$\n    $\\lambda_2 = 4(0) + 5(1)^2 - 3(1) = 2$\n    Since both eigenvalues are positive, the point (1, 0) is an **unstable node**.\n\n*   At **(1, -1)**:\n    $\\lambda_1 = 3(1)^2 - 2(1) = 1$\n    $\\lambda_2 = 4(-1) + 5(1)^2 - 3(1) = -4 + 5 - 3 = -2$\n    Since the eigenvalues are real and of opposite sign ($\\lambda_1=1, \\lambda_2=-2$), the point (1, -1) is a **saddle point**.\n\n*   At **(0, 0)**:\n    Both eigenvalues are zero, so this is a degenerate point that cannot be classified by linearization.\n\n**3. Finding the Separatrix**\n\nSeparatrices are the stable and unstable manifolds of a saddle point. We look for the invariant curves passing through the saddle point (1, -1). We can try to find an analytical solution for a trajectory of the form $d=f(u)$. By differentiating $d(t) = f(u(t))$ with respect to $t$, we get $d' = f'(u)u'$. Substituting the expressions for $d'$ and $u'$, we obtain the differential equation for the trajectories in the phase plane:\n$$ \\frac{dd}{du} = \\frac{2d^2 + (5u^2 - 3u)d - u^3(1-u)}{u^2(u-1)} $$\nWe can test if a simple polynomial solution exists. Let's try the form $d = -u^2$.\nTo verify if this is a solution, we can substitute $d = -u^2$ and its derivative $\\frac{dd}{du} = -2u$ into the trajectory equation.\n\nAlternatively, we can substitute $d=-u^2$ directly into the original system of differential equations. We need to check if $d'(t)$ calculated from the first equation is equal to $\\frac{d}{dt}(-u(t)^2) = -2u(t)u'(t)$.\nFrom the first equation, with $d=-u^2$:\n$d' = 2(-u^2)^2 + (5u^2-3u)(-u^2) - u^3(1-u) = 2u^4 - 5u^4 + 3u^3 - u^3 + u^4 = -2u^4 + 2u^3$.\nUsing the chain rule and the second equation:\n$\\frac{d}{dt}(-u^2) = -2u \\cdot u' = -2u \\cdot (u^2(u-1)) = -2u^3(u-1) = -2u^4 + 2u^3$.\nSince both expressions for $d'$ are identical, the curve **$d = -u^2$** is an exact invariant curve (a trajectory) of the system.\n\nThis curve passes through the equilibrium points:\n*   If $u=0$, then $d = -(0)^2 = 0$. It passes through (0, 0).\n*   If $u=1$, then $d = -(1)^2 = -1$. It passes through the saddle point (1, -1).\n\nAn invariant curve passing through a saddle point must be one of its manifolds. The slope of this curve at the saddle point is $\\frac{dd}{du}|_{u=1} = -2(1) = -2$. The eigenvector for the unstable eigenvalue $\\lambda_1 = 1$ at the saddle point (1, -1) is $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -2 \\end{pmatrix}$, which corresponds to a slope of -2. Thus, the curve $d = -u^2$ is the unstable manifold of the saddle point (1, -1). Unstable manifolds of saddle points are separatrices.\n\n<<<The separatrix is the curve defined by the equation $d = -u^2$.>>>"
