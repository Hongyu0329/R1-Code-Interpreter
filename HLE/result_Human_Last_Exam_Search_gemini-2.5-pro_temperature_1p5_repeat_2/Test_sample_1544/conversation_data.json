    "In the given chess position, determined by the FEN string 8/3p4/1kpP4/p1q5/P7/8/5Q2/6K1 w - - 0 1, White is in a winning position. The key to victory lies in the powerful passed d-pawn on d6, which is only two squares away from promoting to a queen. Black's primary defense rests on their active queen on c5.\n\nWhite's optimal move is to eliminate Black's queen, thereby removing the main obstacle to the d-pawn's advance.\n\nTherefore, White's next move should be:\n\n<<<Qxc5>>>"
