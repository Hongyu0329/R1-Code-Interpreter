    "During World War II, the largest French ship by displacement to be sunk by a U-boat before the armistice of 22 June 1940 was the oil tanker ***Brumaire***.\n\nThe *Brumaire*, with a gross register tonnage of 7,638 tons, was part of the French merchant fleet. On June 19, 1940, the tanker was torpedoed and damaged by the German submarine U-25. The following day, on June 20, 1940, the crippled *Brumaire* was sunk by an attack from the German air force (Luftwaffe). Although the final blow was delivered by aircraft, the initial torpedo attack by the U-boat was the precipitating cause of its loss.\n\nAnother significant loss for the French merchant marine during this period was the steam tanker *Monique*, which had a gross register tonnage of 7,011 tons. It was sunk by the German U-boat U-65 on June 22, 1940. The French Navy also lost the submarine *Doris* (525/765 tons), which was sunk by the German U-boat U-9 on May 8, 1940.\n\nComparing the tonnages of the known French vessels sunk or fatally damaged by U-boats in the specified timeframe, the *Brumaire* stands out as the largest.\n\n<<<Brumaire>>>"
