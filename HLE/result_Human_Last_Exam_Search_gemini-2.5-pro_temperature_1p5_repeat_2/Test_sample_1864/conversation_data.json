    "For a successful five-channel flow cytometry sorting experiment using Streptavidin beads with detection channels for AF350, GFP, PE, AF647, and AF750, preparing a comprehensive set of controls is crucial for obtaining accurate and reproducible results. Here is a breakdown of the essential controls you should prepare:\n\n### 1. Instrument and Gating Controls\n\n*   **Unstained Control (1 tube):** This sample contains only your cells, without any fluorescent labels or streptavidin beads. It is essential for:\n    *   Determining the baseline autofluorescence of your cells.\n    *   Setting the initial forward scatter (FSC) and side scatter (SSC) voltages and gates to identify your cell population of interest while excluding debris.\n\n### 2. Compensation Controls\n\n*   **Single-Stained Controls (5 tubes):** To correct for spectral overlap where the fluorescence of one dye is detected in another's channel, you need a single-stained control for each fluorochrome in your panel. For this experiment, that means one tube for each of the following:\n    *   AF350\n    *   GFP\n    *   PE\n    *   AF647\n    *   AF750\n    These controls can use either cells or compensation beads stained with a single fluorescent label. The positive signal in your compensation control should be at least as bright as what you expect in your fully stained sample.\n\n### 3. Gating Controls for Positive Populations\n\n*   **Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls (5 tubes):** In multicolor experiments, the spread of fluorescence from multiple fluorochromes can make it difficult to set accurate gates for positive populations. FMO controls are critical for this and are prepared by staining cells with all the fluorochromes in your panel except for one. You should prepare an FMO control for each of your five channels. For example, the \"FMO for PE\" tube would contain cells stained with AF350, GFP, AF647, and AF750, but not PE.\n\n### 4. Sample Quality and Specificity Controls\n\n*   **Viability Control (at least 1 additional control tube):** Dead cells can bind antibodies non-specifically and exhibit high autofluorescence, leading to false-positive results. It is highly recommended to include a viability dye in your panel that allows you to exclude dead cells from your analysis. This will add a sixth color to your experiment, and therefore you will need:\n    *   **An additional single-stain compensation control** for the viability dye itself.\n    *   **An additional FMO control** for the viability dye channel is also best practice.\n\n*   **Streptavidin Bead Control (1 tube):** To control for non-specific binding of the streptavidin beads themselves, you should prepare a sample of cells incubated with the fluorescently labeled streptavidin beads but *without* the biotinylated molecule that targets your cells.\n\n*   **Biological Controls (optional, but highly recommended; at least 1-2 tubes):** These controls validate your staining protocol.\n    *   **Positive Control:** Cells that are known to express the target antigen.\n    *   **Negative Control:** Cells that are known *not* to express the target antigen.\n\n### Summary of Essential Controls\n\nBased on best practices, which include the use of a viability dye (making it a 6-color panel for control purposes), you should prepare a minimum of **14 control tubes**.\n\nHere's the tally:\n*   **Unstained Control:** 1\n*   **Single-Stain Compensation Controls:** 6 (5 for your markers + 1 for viability dye)\n*   **Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls:** 6 (5 for your markers + 1 for viability dye)\n*   **Streptavidin Bead Non-Specific Binding Control:** 1\n\nThis brings the total to 14 essential control tubes. This number does not include optional but recommended biological or isotype controls. While this may seem like a large number, these controls are fundamental for a high-quality, reliable cell sorting experiment.\n\n<<<14>>>"
