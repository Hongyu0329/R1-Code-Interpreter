    "To determine the oligomeric state of the protein coiled-coil sequence `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG`, we must first identify the heptad repeat pattern, denoted `(abcdefg)n`, and specifically the residues at the core `a` and `d` positions. These positions are typically occupied by hydrophobic amino acids and their identity is the primary determinant of the oligomeric state through \"knobs-into-holes\" packing.\n\n1.  **Identifying the Heptad Repeat:**\n    A coiled-coil is characterized by a repeating pattern of seven amino acids, with hydrophobic residues typically at positions `a` and `d`. We can scan the sequence for a repeating `HxxH` pattern, where `H` is a hydrophobic residue and `x` is any residue.\n\n    The sequence is: `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG`\n    The hydrophobic residues are Isoleucine (I), Alanine (A), Leucine (L), and Tryptophan (W).\n\n    Let's test potential `a` and `d` assignments:\n    *   If we examine the segment `...AQSL...`, we see a pattern of `A-x-x-L`. This matches the `a-b-c-d` spacing. Let's see if this repeats.\n    *   Heptad 1 (residues 4-10): `A Q S L K E I`. Here `a=A`, `d=L`.\n    *   Heptad 2 (residues 11-17): `A K S L K E I`. Here `a=A`, `d=L`.\n    *   Heptad 3 (residues 18-24): `A W S L K E I`. Here `a=A`, `d=L`. (The `W` is at the `b` position).\n    *   Heptad 4 (residues 25-29): `A Q S L K`. This is a partial heptad, but consistently shows `a=A`, `d=L`.\n\n    This parsing is consistent across the sequence. Therefore, the core of this coiled-coil is defined by having **Alanine (A) at the `a` positions** and **Leucine (L) at the `d` positions**.\n\n2.  **Determining Oligomeric State from Core Residues:**\n    The specific amino acids at the `a` and `d` positions dictate the packing geometry and, consequently, the number of helices in the coil. Seminal studies on the GCN4 coiled coil established key rules:\n    *   **Dimer (2 helices):** Favored by Isoleucine at `a` and Leucine at `d` (`I-L`).\n    *   **Trimer (3 helices):** Favored by Isoleucine at both `a` and `d` (`I-I`).\n    *   **Tetramer (4 helices):** Favored by Leucine at `a` and Isoleucine at `d` (`L-I`).\n\n    Our sequence has an `A-L` pattern. This specific combination is not in the simple rules above, so we must rely on the principles of packing efficiency:\n\n    *   **Trimers:** The packing at the `a` and `d` positions in a trimer is quite similar. Therefore, trimers prefer residues of similar size and shape at both positions (e.g., Isoleucine in both). The significant size difference between the small Alanine and the bulky Leucine makes a stable, efficient trimeric core unlikely.\n    *   **Tetramers:** The `a` positions form a tight, central core that favors small residues to avoid steric clashes. Alanine is small and would fit well. However, the established motif for tetramers is `L-I`. The `A-L` pattern of our sequence does not match this.\n    *   **Dimers:** The packing environments for the `a` and `d` layers are different (\"parallel\" vs. \"perpendicular\" knobs-into-holes), which readily accommodates residues of different sizes. The canonical dimer-forming sequence GCN4 has an `I-L` pattern. Replacing the bulky Isoleucine at the `a` position with the small Alanine (`A-L`) would reduce the buried hydrophobic surface, possibly lowering stability, but it is sterically compatible with a dimeric structure. Furthermore, studies have shown that substituting core positions with alanine can result in dimer formation. The presence of polar residues at other positions, such as the `K` and `E` in the first heptad which could form salt bridges, also often supports a dimeric state.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the analysis, the `A(a)-L(d)` pattern is most consistent with a dimeric structure. The asymmetry in side-chain size (`Ala` vs. `Leu`) disfavors the symmetric core of a trimer, and the pattern does not match the specific requirements for a tetramer. Therefore, the most stable oligomeric state would be a dimer.\n\n<<<A>>>"
