Yes, changing the amide group to a PEG group is a promising strategy to solve the precipitation problem. The original probe has significant hydrophobic regions (the thioxanthenone core and the chloro-hexyl chain) that likely cause it to have low solubility in the aqueous cell culture medium, leading to precipitation at the high concentration of 100 uM. PEGylation, the process of attaching a polyethylene glycol (PEG) chain, is a well-established method for increasing the water solubility and stability of hydrophobic molecules. By replacing the amide group with a hydrophilic PEG chain, the overall polarity of the probe would be increased, which should improve its solubility and prevent it from precipitating in the cell culture medium.
