The equilibrium values of entropy and mean energy for the Bose case of the light quanta are given by the well-known expressions for a photon gas in thermal equilibrium, which can be derived from the fundamental principles of statistical mechanics that are rigorously established by large deviation theorems. The mean energy (U) is proportional to the fourth power of the temperature (T) and the volume (V), as described by the Stefan-Boltzmann law. The entropy (S) is proportional to the volume and the cube of the temperature. Specifically:

*   **Mean Energy (U):**  `U ∝ V * T^4`
*   **Entropy (S):** `S ∝ V * T^3`

These relationships are a direct consequence of the system being described by the Bose-Einstein statistics with zero chemical potential, leading to Planck's distribution for the energy density at equilibrium.
