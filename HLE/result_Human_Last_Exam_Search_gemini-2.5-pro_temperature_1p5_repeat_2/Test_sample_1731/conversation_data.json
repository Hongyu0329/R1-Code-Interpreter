    "### Equilibrium State of Light Quanta: A Large Deviation Perspective\n\nThe equilibrium values of entropy and mean energy for the Bose case of light quanta, commonly known as a photon gas, can be determined using the principles of large deviation theory, specifically through the application of the Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramer-Chernoff theorems. These theorems provide a framework for understanding the statistical behavior of large systems and identifying their most probable macroscopic states, which correspond to thermodynamic equilibrium.\n\nA photon gas in a cavity is a collection of non-interacting bosons (light quanta) where the number of particles is not conserved. A crucial characteristic of a photon gas in thermal equilibrium is that its chemical potential is zero. The system's state is defined by the number of photons at different energy levels.\n\nTo apply large deviation theory, we consider the energy levels of the photons. According to Planck's hypothesis, the energy of a photon is quantized and is given by `E = hν`, where `h` is Planck's constant and `ν` is the frequency. For a system with a large number of photons, we can analyze the empirical distribution of these energy states.\n\n**Applying the Boltzmann-Sanov Theorem**\n\nSanov's theorem deals with the probability of an empirical measure being close to a certain distribution. In the context of the photon gas, the \"microscopic variables\" can be considered the energy states of individual photons. The theorem states that the probability of observing a particular macroscopic state (defined by a distribution of photons over energy levels) is exponentially related to the relative entropy (or Kullback-Leibler divergence) between the observed distribution and the underlying a priori distribution.\n\nThe equilibrium state is the one that maximizes the entropy for a given average energy, or equivalently, the one that minimizes the large deviation rate function under the constraint of a fixed mean energy. The rate function in Sanov's theorem is the relative entropy. The distribution that minimizes this rate function subject to the constraint on the mean energy is the celebrated **Bose-Einstein distribution** for a gas with zero chemical potential, which for photons gives the **Planck's law** for the energy density spectrum.\n\n**Equilibrium Mean Energy and Entropy**\n\nFrom the derived equilibrium distribution (Planck's law), the mean energy and entropy of the photon gas can be calculated.\n\nThe **mean energy (U)** of a photon gas in a volume V at temperature T is found by integrating the energy of photons over all frequencies, weighted by the Planck distribution. The result is proportional to the fourth power of the temperature, a relationship known as the Stefan-Boltzmann law.\n\nThe **entropy (S)** of the photon gas can also be calculated from the equilibrium distribution. Using the thermodynamic relation between energy, temperature, and entropy, it is found that the entropy is proportional to the volume and the cube of the temperature. For a photon gas, the following relations hold for the total energy U and entropy S in a volume V at temperature T:\n\n*   **Mean Energy (U):** `U = a * V * T^4`, where 'a' is the radiation constant.\n*   **Entropy (S):** `S = (4/3) * a * V * T^3`\n\nHere, `a = (8 * π^5 * k^4) / (15 * c^3 * h^3)`, where `k` is the Boltzmann constant, `c` is the speed of light, and `h` is the Planck constant.\n\n**The Role of Cramer-Chernoff Theorem**\n\nThe Cramer-Chernoff theorem is closely related to Sanov's theorem and provides the rate function for the large deviations of the sample mean of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables. In this context, if we consider the energies of the individual photons as i.i.d. random variables, the Cramer-Chernoff theorem allows us to calculate the probability of the average energy deviating from its expected value at equilibrium. The equilibrium mean energy determined via the Boltzmann-Sanov approach corresponds to the expected value in the Cramer-Chernoff framework.\n\nIn essence, these large deviation theorems provide a rigorous mathematical foundation for the principles of statistical mechanics discovered by Boltzmann. They demonstrate that the equilibrium state of a system like a photon gas is not just a postulate but a consequence of the overwhelming probability of observing the macroscopic state with the highest multiplicity, a concept elegantly captured by the rate function in large deviation theory.\n\n<<<The equilibrium values of entropy and mean energy for the Bose case of the light quanta are given by the well-known expressions for a photon gas in thermal equilibrium, which can be derived from the fundamental principles of statistical mechanics that are rigorously established by large deviation theorems. The mean energy (U) is proportional to the fourth power of the temperature (T) and the volume (V), as described by the Stefan-Boltzmann law. The entropy (S) is proportional to the volume and the cube of the temperature. Specifically:\n\n*   **Mean Energy (U):**  `U ∝ V * T^4`\n*   **Entropy (S):** `S ∝ V * T^3`\n\nThese relationships are a direct consequence of the system being described by the Bose-Einstein statistics with zero chemical potential, leading to Planck's distribution for the energy density at equilibrium.>>>"
