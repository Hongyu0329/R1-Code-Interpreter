    "### No Storage Permitted for Opened Single-Dose Ampules in a Sterile Environment\n\nOnce a single-dose glass ampule is opened, it must be used immediately and cannot be stored for any period, even if opened in a sterile environment such as an ISO Class 5 cleanroom. This is a critical distinction from single-dose vials, which have different guidelines.\n\nThe guidance from United States Pharmacopeia (USP) and other regulatory bodies is clear on this matter. Opened ampules cannot be resealed, leaving the contents exposed to potential microbial contamination. Therefore, to ensure patient safety, any unused portion of the medication from a single-dose ampule must be discarded immediately after the initial dose is drawn.\n\nFor the sake of comparison, single-dose *vials* that have been punctured under sterile conditions (ISO Class 5 or better) can have a Beyond-Use Date (BUD) of up to 12 hours, provided they remain within that sterile environment and are stored according to the manufacturer's labeling. If a single-dose vial is punctured in an environment with air quality less than ISO Class 5, it should be discarded within one hour.\n\nHowever, for a single-dose **ampule**, the rule is absolute: there is no permissible storage time after it has been opened.\n\n<<<Opened single-dose ampules must not be stored for any time period and must be discarded immediately after use.>>>"
