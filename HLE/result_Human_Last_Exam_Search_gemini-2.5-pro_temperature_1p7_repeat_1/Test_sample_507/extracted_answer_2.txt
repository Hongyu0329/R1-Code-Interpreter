Two languages from different Asian cultures with nearly identical words for "mom" and "dad" are Tamil and Korean. In Tamil, "mom" is "Amma" and "dad" is "Appa". In Korean, "mom" is "Eomma" and "dad" is "Appa". While these cultures are geographically distant and their languages belong to different families, some historical theories suggest ancient maritime contact. However, the word for "broom" in these two languages is not similar; it is "thudaippam" in Tamil and "bi" or "bisjalu" in Korean. The similarity in parental terms is likely due to the commonality of babbling sounds made by infants across all cultures.
