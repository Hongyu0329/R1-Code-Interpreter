    "The smallest possible number of isometric embeddings of a finite ultrametric space $X$ into a Banach space $B$ is 0.\n\nTo determine the smallest possible number of such embeddings, we need to find the minimum number of embeddings over all possible choices of a finite ultrametric space $X$ and a Banach space $B$. If we can find a specific pair $(X, B)$ for which the number of isometric embeddings is zero, then this must be the minimum possible number, as the number of embeddings cannot be negative.\n\nConsider the following choice for the finite ultrametric space $X$ and the Banach space $B$:\n\n1.  **The Finite Ultrametric Space $X$**: Let $X$ be a set of three distinct points, say $X = \\{a, b, c\\}$. Define a metric $d$ on $X$ such that the distance between any two distinct points is 1. That is, $d(a, b) = d(b, c) = d(c, a) = 1$. This space is ultrametric because for any three points $x, y, z \\in X$, the strong triangle inequality $d(x, z) \\le \\max\\{d(x, y), d(y, z)\\}$ holds. For example, $d(a, c) = 1 \\le \\max\\{d(a, b), d(b, c)\\} = \\max\\{1, 1\\} = 1$.\n\n2.  **The Banach Space $B$**: Let $B$ be the set of real numbers $\\mathbb{R}$ with the standard norm, i.e., the absolute value $| \\cdot |$. The space $\\mathbb{R}$ is a 1-dimensional Banach space. The cardinality of this Banach space is $K = c$, the cardinality of the continuum.\n\nNow, let's determine the number of isometric embeddings of this specific $X$ into this specific $B$. An isometric embedding is a function $f: X \\to B$ such that for any two points $p_1, p_2 \\in X$, the equality $\\|f(p_1) - f(p_2)\\| = d(p_1, p_2)$ is satisfied.\n\nLet's assume such an embedding $f: X \\to \\mathbb{R}$ exists. We would need to find three real numbers $f(a)$, $f(b)$, and $f(c)$ such that:\n*   $|f(a) - f(b)| = 1$\n*   $|f(b) - f(c)| = 1$\n*   $|f(a) - f(c)| = 1$\n\nWithout loss of generality, we can place the image of point $a$ at the origin, so $f(a) = 0$.\nFrom the first condition, we have $|0 - f(b)| = 1$, which implies $f(b) = 1$ or $f(b) = -1$. Let's choose $f(b) = 1$.\n\nNow we use the other two conditions to find $f(c)$:\n*   $|1 - f(c)| = 1$\n*   $|0 - f(c)| = 1$\n\nThe condition $|f(c)| = 1$ means that $f(c) = 1$ or $f(c) = -1$.\n*   If we test $f(c) = 1$, the condition $|1 - f(c)| = |1 - 1| = 0$. This is not equal to 1, so this choice is invalid.\n*   If we test $f(c) = -1$, the condition $|1 - f(c)| = |1 - (-1)| = |2| = 2$. This is not equal to 1, so this choice is also invalid.\n\nSince both possible values for $f(c)$ lead to a contradiction, no such real number $f(c)$ exists. Therefore, there are no isometric embeddings of the chosen space $X$ into the Banach space $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\nConclusion: We have found an example of a finite ultrametric space $X$ and a Banach space $B$ for which the number of isometric embeddings is 0. Since the number of embeddings cannot be negative, the smallest possible number is 0.\n\nThis holds even though it is known that any finite ultrametric space can be isometrically embedded into other Banach spaces, such as a sufficiently high-dimensional Euclidean space $\\mathbb{R}^n$ (for $n \\ge 2$ in this example) or any infinite-dimensional Banach space. The question asks for the minimum possible number, which allows for the selection of a specific space $B$ that fails to accommodate a specific space $X$.\n\n<<<0>>>"
