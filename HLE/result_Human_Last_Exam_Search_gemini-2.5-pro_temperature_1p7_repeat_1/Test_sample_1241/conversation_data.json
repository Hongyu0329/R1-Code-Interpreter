    "An analysis of the provided system of equations reveals an inconsistency when applying the conservation of probability principle, which states that the sum of the probabilities of all states must equal 1 at all times. This suggests a likely typographical error in the problem statement.\n\n### Inconsistency in the Original Problem\n\nThe sum of the probabilities is given as:\n$P_{0}(t) + P_{1}(t) + P_{2}(t) + P_{3}(t) = 1$\n\nDifferentiating this with respect to time $t$ implies that the sum of the derivatives of the probabilities must be zero:\n$P_{0}'(t) + P_{1}'(t) + P_{2}'(t) + P_{3}'(t) = 0$\n\nHowever, summing the given differential equations yields:\n$P_{0}' + P_{1}' + P_{2}' + P_{3}' = -0.038 P_{0}(t)$\n\nFor the sum of the derivatives to be zero, it must be that $P_{0}(t) = 0$ for all time $t$. If $P_{0}(t)=0$, the first equation ($P_{0}'(t) = -\\lambda_{01}P_{0}(t) + \\lambda_{10}P_{1}(t)$) implies that $P_{1}(t) = 0$. Following this logic through the system leads to the conclusion that all probabilities must be zero in the steady state ($t \\to +\\infty$). This contradicts the condition that the probabilities must sum to 1.\n\n### Corrected System and Solution\n\nThis type of inconsistency typically arises from a sign error in the formulation of the equations for a physical or probabilistic system. The \"Kolmogorov-Chapman system\" (more commonly known as Kolmogorov-Chapman equations) describes the evolution of probabilities in a continuous-time Markov chain. In such a system, the flow of probability out of one state contributes positively to the rate of change of the destination state's probability.\n\nThe original second equation is:\n$P_{1}'(t) = -\\lambda_{01}P_{0}(t) - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12})P_{1}(t) + \\lambda_{21}P_{2}(t) + \\lambda_{31}P_{3}(t)$\n\nThe term $-\\lambda_{01}P_{0}(t)$ represents the transition from state 0 to state 1 and should be positive. Correcting this sign yields the standard form:\n$P_{1}'(t) = +\\lambda_{01}P_{0}(t) - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12})P_{1}(t) + \\lambda_{21}P_{2}(t) + \\lambda_{31}P_{3}(t)$\n\nWith this correction, the sum of the derivatives becomes identically zero, and the system is consistent. We can now find the steady-state probabilities ($P_i = P_i(+\\infty)$) by setting all derivatives to zero.\n\nThe corrected steady-state equations are:\n1. $0 = -0.019 P_0 + 0.65 P_1$\n2. $0 = 0.019 P_0 - (0.65 + 0.4) P_1 + 0.392 P_2 + 0.008 P_3$\n3. $0 = 0.4 P_1 - (0.392 + 0.008) P_2 \\implies 0.4 P_1 = 0.4 P_2 \\implies P_1 = P_2$\n4. $0 = 0.008 P_2 - 0.008 P_3 \\implies P_2 = P_3$\n5. $P_0 + P_1 + P_2 + P_3 = 1$\n\nFrom equations (3) and (4), we have $P_1 = P_2 = P_3$.\nFrom equation (1), we get $P_0 = \\frac{0.65}{0.019} P_1$.\n\nNow, we use the normalization condition (5):\n$\\frac{0.65}{0.019} P_1 + P_1 + P_1 + P_1 = 1$\n$(\\frac{0.65}{0.019} + 3) P_1 = 1$\n$P_1 = \\frac{1}{\\frac{0.65 + 3 \\times 0.019}{0.019}} = \\frac{0.019}{0.65 + 0.057} = \\frac{0.019}{0.707}$\n\nNow we can find $P_0$:\n$P_0 = \\frac{0.65}{0.019} P_1 = \\frac{0.65}{0.019} \\left( \\frac{0.019}{0.707} \\right) = \\frac{0.65}{0.707}$\n\nThe quantity to be found is $P_0(+\\infty) + P_1(+\\infty) = P_0 + P_1$:\n$P_0 + P_1 = \\frac{0.65}{0.707} + \\frac{0.019}{0.707} = \\frac{0.65 + 0.019}{0.707} = \\frac{0.669}{0.707}$\n\nThis fraction can be calculated as a decimal:\n$\\frac{0.669}{0.707} \\approx 0.946251768$\n\nBased on the assumption of a typographical error standard in such problems, the result is derived from the corrected, consistent system.\n\n<<<0.946251768>>>"
