    "<<<In the grand canonical ensemble, the partition function Z is defined as:\n\nZ = Tr[e^(-β(H^ - μN^))]\n\nwhere:\n*   `Tr` is the trace over all states in the Fock space.\n*   β = 1/(k_B T) is the inverse temperature, with k_B being the Boltzmann constant and T the absolute temperature.\n*   H^ is the Hamiltonian operator of the system.\n*   μ is the chemical potential of the reservoir.\n*   N^ is the particle number operator.\n\nThe problem specifies the Hamiltonian as H^ = -μN^. Substituting this into the general definition gives:\n\nZ = Tr[e^(-β(-μN^ - μN^))] = Tr[e^(-β(-2μN^))] = Tr[e^(2βμN^)]\n\nThis expression can be formulated as a path integral over fields ψ(x,τ). The path integral representation of the partition function is given by a functional integral over all possible field configurations in imaginary time τ, which ranges from 0 to β.\n\nZ = ∫ D[ψ*, ψ] e^(-S[ψ*, ψ])\n\nThe action S[ψ*, ψ] is given by:\n\nS[ψ*, ψ] = ∫₀^β dτ ∫ dᵈx L(ψ*, ψ)\n\nwhere the Lagrangian L corresponds to the grand canonical operator K^ = H^ - μN^. In this specific case, K^ = -2μN^. In a field representation, where N^ corresponds to ∫ dᵈx ψ*(x, τ)ψ(x, τ), the Lagrangian density is:\n\nL = ψ*(x, τ)∂_τψ(x, τ) - 2μ ψ*(x, τ)ψ(x, τ)\n\nCombining these terms gives the action:\n\n**S[ψ*, ψ] = ∫₀^β dτ ∫ dᵈx ψ*(x, τ) (∂_τ - 2μ) ψ(x, τ)**\n\nTherefore, the partition function Z for the system with Hamiltonian H^ = -μN^ in the grand canonical ensemble, expressed using path integrals, is:\n\n**Z = ∫ D[ψ*, ψ] exp( - ∫₀^β dτ ∫ dᵈx ψ*(x, τ) (∂_τ - 2μ) ψ(x, τ) )**\n\nThe properties of the fields ψ and the boundary conditions for the integral depend on the statistics of the particles:\n*   For **bosons**, ψ are complex-valued fields, and they must satisfy periodic boundary conditions in imaginary time: ψ(x, 0) = ψ(x, β).\n*   For **fermions**, ψ are Grassmann-valued fields (anti-commuting numbers), and they must satisfy anti-periodic boundary conditions in imaginary time: ψ(x, 0) = -ψ(x, β)."
