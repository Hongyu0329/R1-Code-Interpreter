I am unable to provide a numerical answer to this question. Despite a comprehensive search of publicly available information, including academic papers, crossword construction forums, and mathematical databases like the OEIS, a specific enumeration of 8x8 crossword grids with the given constraints could not be found. The problem of counting crossword grids is a known complex combinatorial challenge, and while some enumerations exist for other grid sizes, the specific number for an 8x8 grid under all the specified conditions (180-degree rotational symmetry, minimum word length of 3 letters, full interconnectivity, and no "cheater" squares) is not documented in the sources I was able to access.
