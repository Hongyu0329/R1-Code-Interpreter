    "The Grigorchuk group has 7 subgroups of index 4.\n\nThis result is obtained by counting the number of surjective homomorphisms from the Grigorchuk group, denoted as *G*, to groups of order 4. Any subgroup of index 4 is the kernel of such a homomorphism. The possible groups of order 4 are the cyclic group of order 4 (ℤ₄) and the Klein four-group (V₄ ≅ ℤ₂ × ℤ₂).\n\nThe Grigorchuk group is a 2-group, which means that every element has an order that is a power of 2. This property implies that there can be no surjective homomorphism from *G* to ℤ₄, because ℤ₄ contains an element of order 4. Therefore, any subgroup of index 4 in the Grigorchuk group must be the kernel of a surjective homomorphism to the Klein four-group, V₄.\n\nTo find the number of these subgroups, we first count the number of homomorphisms from *G* to V₄. Any homomorphism from a group *G* to an abelian group (like V₄) factors through the abelianization of *G*, which is the quotient group *G*/[*G*,*G*]. The abelianization of the Grigorchuk group is known to be isomorphic to (ℤ/2ℤ)³, a group of order 8.\n\nThe number of homomorphisms from *G* to V₄ is therefore equal to the number of homomorphisms from (ℤ/2ℤ)³ to V₄ ≅ (ℤ/2ℤ)². A homomorphism from (ℤ/2ℤ)³ to (ℤ/2ℤ)² is determined by where it sends the three generators of the domain. Each generator can be mapped to any of the four elements of the codomain, so there are 4³ = 64 possible homomorphisms.\n\nNext, we determine how many of these homomorphisms are surjective. A homomorphism is not surjective if its image is a proper subgroup of V₄. The proper subgroups of V₄ are the trivial group and three distinct subgroups of order 2.\n*   There is only **1** homomorphism whose image is the trivial subgroup.\n*   For each of the **3** subgroups of order 2, the number of non-trivial homomorphisms from (ℤ/2ℤ)³ to it is 2³ - 1 = 7. This gives 3 × 7 = **21** homomorphisms with an image of order 2.\n\nThus, the number of surjective homomorphisms is 64 - (1 + 21) = 42.\n\nThese 42 surjective homomorphisms define subgroups of index 4. However, different homomorphisms can have the same kernel. Two surjective homomorphisms, φ₁ and φ₂, from *G* to V₄ have the same kernel if and only if they are related by an automorphism of V₄, i.e., φ₂ = α ∘ φ₁ for some α ∈ Aut(V₄). The automorphism group of V₄ is GL(2, ℤ₂), which has an order of (2² - 1)(2² - 2) = 6.\n\nFinally, the number of distinct subgroups of index 4 is the number of surjective homomorphisms divided by the order of the automorphism group of V₄:\n\nNumber of subgroups of index 4 = 42 / 6 = 7.\n\n<<<7>>>"
