    "To find the probability that a particle in a one-dimensional box is located in a specific interval, one must integrate the probability density function, |ψ(x)|², over that interval. For a particle in a 1D box of length *a*, the normalized wavefunction for the n-th energy state is given by:\n\nψn(x) = √(2/a) * sin(nπx/a)\n\nThe probability density, |ψn(x)|², is therefore:\n\nP(x) = (2/a) * sin²(nπx/a)\n\nFor this problem, we are interested in the n=2 state (the first excited state) and the interval from x₁ = 0.495a to x₂ = 0.505a. For n=2, there is a node at the center of the box (x = a/2), meaning the probability of finding the particle at this exact point is zero.\n\nThe probability (P) is calculated by the definite integral:\n\nP = ∫₀.₄₉₅ₐ⁰.⁵⁰⁵ₐ (2/a) * sin²(2πx/a) dx\n\nThe indefinite integral of (2/a) * sin²(nπx/a) is:\n\n(x/a) - [sin(2nπx/a) / (2nπ)]\n\nSubstituting n=2 and evaluating this integral from 0.495a to 0.505a gives:\n\nP = [x/a - sin(4πx/a)/(4π)] from x = 0.495a to x = 0.505a\n\nEvaluating at the limits:\n\nP = [0.505 - sin(4π * 0.505) / (4π)] - [0.495 - sin(4π * 0.495) / (4π)]\nP = 0.01 - [sin(2.02π) - sin(1.98π)] / (4π)\nP = 0.01 - [sin(0.02π) - (-sin(0.02π))] / (4π)\nP = 0.01 - [2sin(0.02π)] / (4π)\nP = 0.01 - sin(0.02π) / (2π)\n\nUsing a calculator for the final value:\n\n*   0.02 * π ≈ 0.06283\n*   sin(0.06283) ≈ 0.06281\n*   0.06281 / (2π) ≈ 0.009997\n*   P ≈ 0.01 - 0.009997 = 0.000003\n\nThe probability of finding the particle in the interval from 0.495a to 0.505a for n=2 is approximately 3.24 x 10⁻⁶.\n\n<<<3.2429e-6>>>"
