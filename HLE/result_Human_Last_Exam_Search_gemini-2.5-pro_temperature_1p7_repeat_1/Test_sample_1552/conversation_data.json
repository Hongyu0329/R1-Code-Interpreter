    "### Second Coefficient in Heat Kernel Expansion for a Massless Gauged Dirac Spinor Field\n\nThe second coefficient, denoted as a‚ÇÇ, in the heat kernel expansion of the spectral action for a massless gauged Dirac spinor field on a four-dimensional Riemannian manifold is a crucial quantity in quantum field theory and geometry. It encapsulates information about the one-loop divergences of the theory and is constructed from local geometric invariants.\n\nFor a Dirac operator ùê∑ coupled to a gauge field, the heat kernel of its square, D¬≤, has an asymptotic expansion in the limit of small \"time\" parameter *t*:\n\nTr(e^(-tD¬≤)) ~ (1 / (4œÄt)¬≤) * Œ£(n=0 to ‚àû) t‚Åø * a‚Çô\n\nThe coefficients a‚Çô are known as the Seeley-DeWitt coefficients.\n\nThe second of these coefficients, a‚ÇÇ, for a massless Dirac spinor field minimally coupled to a gauge field is given by:\n\n**a‚ÇÇ = (1/12) tr(F<sub>ŒºŒΩ</sub>F<sup>ŒºŒΩ</sup>) + (1/6) R ‚ãÖ I**\n\nWhere:\n\n*   **F<sub>ŒºŒΩ</sub>** is the field strength tensor of the gauge field.\n*   **R** is the Ricci scalar curvature of the spacetime manifold.\n*   **tr** denotes the trace over the spinor and gauge group indices.\n*   **I** is the identity in the space of spinors.\n\nThis expression is a standard result in the study of quantum fields in curved spacetime and has applications in understanding anomalies and the effective action of the theory. The first term, involving the field strength, represents the contribution from the gauge field, while the second term, with the Ricci scalar, accounts for the coupling to the gravitational background.\n\nThe computation of these coefficients is a standard procedure in the field, often presented in textbooks and review articles on quantum field theory in curved space and the heat kernel expansion. The coefficient `a2` is particularly important as it is related to the logarithmic divergences of the one-loop effective action in four dimensions.\n\n<<<**a‚ÇÇ = (1/12) tr(F<sub>ŒºŒΩ</sub>F<sup>ŒºŒΩ</sup>) + (1/6) R ‚ãÖ I**>>>"
