    "A self-avoiding walk on a lattice is a path from one point to another that does not visit the same point more than once. The \"Manhattan lattice\" is another name for the square lattice. The number of n-step self-avoiding walks, denoted as a(n), is a sequence of numbers that is difficult to calculate with a simple formula.\n\nFor a square lattice, the initial values of the sequence are:\n*   a(1) = 4\n*   a(2) = 12\n*   a(3) = 36\n*   a(4) = 100\n\nWhile there is no simple formula to determine a(n) for any given n, computer-intensive methods have been used to calculate the exact number of self-avoiding walks for specific lengths. For a 10-step self-avoiding walk on a square lattice, the value has been calculated.\n\nThe number of 10-step self-avoiding walks on a Manhattan (square) lattice is 44,100.\n\n<<<44100>>>"
