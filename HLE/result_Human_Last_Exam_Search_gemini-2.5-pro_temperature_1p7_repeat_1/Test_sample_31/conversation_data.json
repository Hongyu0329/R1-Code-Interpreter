    "To fully identify the Permutation of the Last Layer (PLL) case when using the CFOP method on a 3x3 Rubik's Cube, it is possible to do so by observing a minimum of **5** non-top-facing stickers.\n\nWhile many solvers learn to recognize PLL cases by looking at the six stickers on two adjacent sides of the last layer, more advanced techniques have established that only five of these stickers are necessary to distinguish between all 21 PLL cases.\n\nThe standard method for fast PLL recognition is known as two-sided recognition, where the solver looks at the stickers on the front and right faces of the top layer. This initially involves observing the three vertical stickers on the front (a corner, an edge, and a corner) and the three vertical stickers on the right side. However, for minimal recognition, one of these sticker views is redundant. By observing the non-top-facing stickers of three corner pieces and two edge pieces, a solver can deduce the entire permutation of the last layer. For example, looking at the front stickers of the front-left and front-right corners and the front edge, along with the side stickers of the front-right and back-right corners, provides enough information.\n\nTherefore, with efficient recognition, only five non-top-facing stickers must be seen to identify any PLL case.\n\n<<<5>>>"
