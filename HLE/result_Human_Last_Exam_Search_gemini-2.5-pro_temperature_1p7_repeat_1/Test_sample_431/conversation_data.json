    "Based on structural and sequence analysis from the UniProt database, there is **one** cysteine residue located in the large intracellular loop between the third and fourth transmembrane domains (TM3 and TM4) of the human GABAAρ1 receptor subunit.\n\nThe human GABAAρ1 receptor, also known as GABRR1, has the UniProt accession number P24046. The protein contains a total of three cysteine residues. Two of these (C177 and C191) are located in the extracellular N-terminal domain and form a characteristic \"Cys-loop.\"\n\nThe third cysteine is located at position 364 (C364). This residue is situated within the large intracellular loop that connects the TM3 and TM4 domains. While UniProt's computational model places this residue at the very end of the TM3 helix, functional studies identify it as an intracellular residue within the TM3-TM4 loop, crucial for modulation by reactive oxygen species. The TM3-TM4 loop is the only intracellular domain that contains a cysteine residue.\n\nTherefore, the TM3-TM4 linker domain of the human GABAAρ1 homomeric receptor contains one cysteine residue.\n\n<<<1>>>"
