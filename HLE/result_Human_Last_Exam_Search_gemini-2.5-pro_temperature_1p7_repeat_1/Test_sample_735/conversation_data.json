    "There are 40 finite groups that contain maximal by inclusion product-free sets of size 3.\n\nThis classification is the result of work by Giudici, Hart, and Anabanti. A crucial finding was that any group G containing a locally maximal product-free set of size 3 must have an order of |G| â‰¤ 24. This result confirmed a conjecture by Giudici and Hart and allowed for the completion of the classification.\n\nThe full list of these groups is provided in a table within the paper \"Locally Maximal Product-free Sets of Size 3\" by Anabanti and Hart, which revised and completed an earlier table by Giudici and Hart. The groups identified are:\n\n*   **Cyclic Groups:** C5, C6, C7, C8, C9, C10, C11, C12, C13, C14, C15, C16, C17, C18, C20, C21, C22, C24\n*   **Dihedral Groups:** D8, D10, D12, D14, D16, D18, D20, D22, D24 (Note: S3 is isomorphic to D6 and is on the list)\n*   **Quaternion and Dicyclic Groups:** Q8, Q12 (also denoted Dic3), Q16\n*   **Abelian but not Cyclic Groups:** C2 x C4, C2 x C8, C4 x C4\n*   **Other Groups:**\n    *   A4 (Alternating group on 4 letters)\n    *   SL(2,3) (Special linear group)\n    *   S3 x C3\n    *   C2 x Q8\n    *   Modular group of order 16\n    *   Frobenius group of order 20 (also denoted F20 or AGL(1,5))\n\nCounting these distinct groups gives a total of 40.\n\n<<<40>>>"
