    "To find the central pixel of the line between (1,1) and (11, 5) using Bresenham's line algorithm, we first need to determine all the pixels that form the line. Bresenham's algorithm is an efficient way to do this using integer arithmetic.\n\nHere are the steps for the given line:\n\n1.  **Calculate the differences** in the x and y coordinates:\n    *   dx = x2 - x1 = 11 - 1 = 10\n    *   dy = y2 - y1 = 5 - 1 = 4\n\n2.  **Calculate the initial decision parameter**. The formula for the initial decision parameter (p) is `p = 2 * dy - dx`.\n    *   p = 2 * 4 - 10 = -2\n\n3.  **Iterate and determine the pixel coordinates**. We start at (1,1) and move towards the end point. At each step, we increment x and decide whether to increment y based on the decision parameter.\n\n    The generated pixels are:\n    *   (1, 1)\n    *   (2, 1)\n    *   (3, 2)\n    *   (4, 2)\n    *   (5, 3)\n    *   **(6, 3)**\n    *   (7, 3)\n    *   (8, 4)\n    *   (9, 4)\n    *   (10, 5)\n    *   (11, 5)\n\nThere are a total of 11 pixels that make up the line. The central pixel is the 6th one in this sequence.\n\nThe coordinates of the central pixel are (6, 3).\n\n<<<**(6, 3)**>>>"
