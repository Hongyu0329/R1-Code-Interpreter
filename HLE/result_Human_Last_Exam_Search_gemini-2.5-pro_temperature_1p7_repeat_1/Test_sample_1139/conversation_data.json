    "For the supersymmetric sigma-model describing disordered systems of symmetry class D, the target space of the theory is a supermanifold. For a model with *n* replicas, this supermanifold is the quotient space SpO(2n, R|2n)/U(n|n). The non-Grassmann (bosonic) variables are the coordinates that parametrize the bosonic part of this supermanifold.\n\nThe bosonic part of this target space is itself composed of two sectors: a Bose-Bose (BB) sector and a Fermi-Fermi (FF) sector. The total number of non-Grassmann variables is the sum of the dimensions of these two sectors.\n\nFor the specific case of two replicas (*n*=2), the supermanifold is SpO(4, R|4)/U(2|2).\n*   The Bose-Bose sector is the symmetric space Sp(4,R)/U(2).\n*   The Fermi-Fermi sector is the symmetric space O(4)/U(2).\n\nTo find the total number of non-Grassmann variables, we calculate the dimension of each of these spaces. The dimension of a quotient manifold G/H is given by dim(G) - dim(H).\n\nThe dimensions of the relevant Lie groups are:\n*   dim(Sp(4,R)) = 10\n*   dim(O(4)) = 6\n*   dim(U(2)) = 4\n\nUsing these values, we can determine the dimensions of the BB and FF sectors:\n1.  **Dimension of the Bose-Bose sector (Sp(4,R)/U(2))**:\n    dim(Sp(4,R)) - dim(U(2)) = 10 - 4 = 6.\n\n2.  **Dimension of the Fermi-Fermi sector (O(4)/U(2))**:\n    dim(O(4)) - dim(U(2)) = 6 - 4 = 2.\n\nThe total number of non-Grassmann variables is the sum of the dimensions of these two sectors:\nTotal bosonic dimension = Dimension(BB sector) + Dimension(FF sector) = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nTherefore, 8 non-Grassmann variables are needed to parametrize the bosonic sector of the supersymmetric sigma-model with two replicas for disordered systems of symmetry class D.\n\n<<<8>>>"
