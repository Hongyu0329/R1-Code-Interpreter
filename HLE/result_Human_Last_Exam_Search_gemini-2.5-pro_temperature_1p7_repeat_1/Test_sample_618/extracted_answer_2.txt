The general representation for the infinitesimal transformation on the variable `x` is given by:
`ξ(t) = c₁ * exp(k₁t) + c₃`

where `c₁` and `c₃` are arbitrary constants.

This representation consists of two distinct forms of transformation for the spatial variable `x`:
1.  **Spatial Translation:** The term `c₃` corresponds to a simple translation in `x`, generated by the vector field `∂_x`. The transformation is `x' = x + ε`.
2.  **Time-Dependent Translation:** The term `c₁ * exp(k₁t)` corresponds to a translation in `x` where the magnitude of the shift depends exponentially on time `t`. This transformation is `x' = x + ε * exp(k₁t)`.

Therefore, the most general infinitesimal transformation on `x` is a linear combination of a constant translation and an exponentially time-varying translation.
