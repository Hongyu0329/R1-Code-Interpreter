    "Despite a thorough search for a Hollywood feature film from a major studio depicting a teenager on a pink bike pedaling directly toward an oncoming car, a definitive match could not be found.\n\nNumerous searches were conducted using a variety of keywords related to the scene, including \"teenager pink bike oncoming car,\" \"movie scene girl on pink bike plays chicken with car,\" and \"Hollywood film with a game of chicken between a pink bike and a car.\" The search results did not yield any specific film from a major Hollywood studio that includes this exact sequence of events.\n\nThe investigation did uncover several related, but ultimately incorrect, findings. For example, the upcoming reboot of \"The Naked Gun\" will reportedly feature a scene where a man rides a very small pink bicycle as a comedic gag. Additionally, discussions on forums such as Reddit show that other users have tried to recall films with similar themes, but none have been definitively identified as a major Hollywood production matching the user's description. The independent experimental film *Gummo* (1997) includes scenes with boys on bicycles, but it does not contain the specific \"game of chicken\" with a car and was not produced by a major studio.\n\nThe search also returned numerous news reports and social media videos of real-life incidents where teenagers engage in the dangerous activity of playing \"chicken\" with vehicles, which may be the source of some confusion. However, these are not scenes from fictional feature films.\n\nIt is possible that the user is recalling a scene from a television show, an independent film, a foreign film, or is misremembering certain details of the movie. Without more specific information, it is not possible to definitively identify the Hollywood feature film in question.\n\n<<<I am unable to definitively identify a Hollywood feature film from a major studio that contains the specific scene described.>>>"
