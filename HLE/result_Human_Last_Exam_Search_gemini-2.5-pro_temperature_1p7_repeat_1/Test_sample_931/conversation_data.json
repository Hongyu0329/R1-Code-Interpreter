    "Adult Raphidiopterans, commonly known as snakeflies, are primarily predators of soft-bodied insects like aphids. Several sources also indicate that pollen has been found in their digestive tracts. Some non-predatory species have been noted to feed on nectar, pollen, or honeydew.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the provided options:\n*   **A. Nectar:** While primarily predatory, some species of adult snakeflies also feed on sugary substances like nectar.\n*   **B. Māhoe pollen:** Studies have repeatedly found pollen in the gut of adult snakeflies, but whether it is a required food source is not fully understood. Māhoe is a plant native to New Zealand, and while snakeflies were introduced there, they failed to establish a population. However, feeding on pollen in general is recorded.\n*   **C. Fungus:** There is no evidence to suggest that adult snakeflies feed on fungus.\n*   **D. Karamū leaf tissue:** Adult snakeflies are not recorded as feeding on leaf tissue.\n*   **E. Totara Aphids:** Adult snakeflies are significant predators of aphids. Totara is a tree native to New Zealand. If snakeflies were present where Totara Aphids exist, they would likely be a food source.\n\nBased on the evidence, adult Raphidiopterans feed on both nectar and aphids. Therefore, option F, which includes both A and E, is the most comprehensive answer.\n\n<<<F>>>"
