    "There have been 12 triple crowns won by 10 different players in the American and National Leagues of Major League Baseball since the RBI became an official statistic in 1920. However, with the recent incorporation of Negro League statistics into MLB records, the total number of triple crown winners recognized by MLB is 27.\n\nThe Triple Crown for hitting is achieved when a player leads their league in batting average, home runs, and runs batted in (RBIs) in the same season.\n\nHere is a list of the triple crown winners in the American and National Leagues:\n*   **Miguel Cabrera** (2012, Detroit Tigers)\n*   **Carl Yastrzemski** (1967, Boston Red Sox)\n*   **Frank Robinson** (1966, Baltimore Orioles)\n*   **Mickey Mantle** (1956, New York Yankees)\n*   **Ted Williams** (1942 & 1947, Boston Red Sox)\n*   **Joe Medwick** (1937, St. Louis Cardinals)\n*   **Lou Gehrig** (1934, New York Yankees)\n*   **Jimmie Foxx** (1933, Philadelphia Athletics)\n*   **Chuck Klein** (1933, Philadelphia Phillies)\n*   **Rogers Hornsby** (1922 & 1925, St. Louis Cardinals)\n\nTed Williams and Rogers Hornsby are the only two players to have won the triple crown twice in the American and National Leagues.\n\nBefore RBIs were an official stat, several other players led their league in these three categories:\n*   **Heinie Zimmerman** (1912, Chicago Cubs)\n*   **Ty Cobb** (1909, Detroit Tigers)\n*   **Nap Lajoie** (1901, Philadelphia Athletics)\n*   **Hugh Duffy** (1894, Boston Beaneaters)\n*   **Tip O'Neill** (1887, St. Louis Browns)\n*   **Paul Hines** (1878, Providence Grays)\n\nThe inclusion of Negro League records adds several more winners to the list, including Oscar Charleston, who won it three times, and Josh Gibson, who won it twice.\n\n<<<17>>>"
