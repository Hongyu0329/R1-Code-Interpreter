    "The Wittig reaction is a chemical process that converts aldehydes or ketones into alkenes. It involves the reaction of an aldehyde or ketone with a phosphorus ylide, also known as a Wittig reagent. The key feature of this reaction is the replacement of the carbonyl (C=O) group with a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C), resulting in the formation of an alkene and triphenylphosphine oxide as a byproduct. The exact position of the new double bond is determined by the position of the original carbonyl group.\n\nIn the specified reaction, the two reactants are:\n*   **Pivalaldehyde:** An aldehyde with a bulky tert-butyl group, its structure is (CH₃)₃C-CHO.\n*   **(2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ⁵-phosphane:** This is the phosphorus ylide. Its structure consists of a triphenylphosphine group attached to a two-carbon chain, which has a 2-chlorophenyl group at its end: (2-Cl-C₆H₄)-CH₂-CH=PPh₃.\n\nDuring the reaction, the oxygen atom of the pivalaldehyde's carbonyl group and the `(2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)` part of the ylide are exchanged. This exchange forms a new alkene.\n\nThe resulting product is **1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene**.\n\nThe stereochemistry of the resulting alkene (whether it is the E or Z isomer) depends on the nature of the ylide. Ylides are classified as stabilized, semi-stabilized, or unstabilized. Unstabilized ylides, like the one in this reaction (where the carbon atom of the ylide is attached to alkyl groups), typically lead to the formation of the (Z)-alkene. However, the presence of sterically bulky groups on both the aldehyde (pivalaldehyde) and the ylide can influence the stereochemical outcome, often favoring the more stable (E)-alkene. Without specific reaction conditions, a mixture of E and Z isomers is often produced.\n\nTriphenylphosphine oxide is also formed as a byproduct of the reaction.\n\n<<<1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene>>>"
