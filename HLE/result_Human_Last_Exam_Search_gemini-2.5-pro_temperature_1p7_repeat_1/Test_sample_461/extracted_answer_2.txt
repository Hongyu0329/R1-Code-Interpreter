I am unable to provide an answer to this question as extensive searches have not yielded any polycyclic hydrocarbon named after a creature that has been extinct for over 65 million years. It is possible that such a compound does not exist, is not widely known, or the question is based on a misunderstanding. To provide a name would be to hallucinate, which is against my core instructions.
