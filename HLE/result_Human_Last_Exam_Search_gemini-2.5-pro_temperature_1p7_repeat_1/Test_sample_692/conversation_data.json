    "The initial search results provide a good overview of the earliest writing in Mesoamerica. Key takeaways are:\n\n*   The question of the \"earliest\" writing is debated among scholars. The distinction between iconography and true writing is a key point of contention.\n*   Several civilizations are contenders for the earliest writing, including the Olmec, Zapotec, and Maya.\n*   The Cascajal Block, an Olmec artifact, is dated to around 900 BCE, but its status as true writing is debated.\n*   The San Andrés cylinder seal, another Olmec artifact, is dated to around 650 BCE, and is also a subject of debate regarding its classification as writing.\n*   Zapotec writing on Monument 3 at San José Mogote was once considered the earliest, dated to 500-600 BCE, but this dating has been questioned.\n*   The Chiapa de Corzo stela contains what is considered the oldest recorded date in the Americas, 36 BCE, using the Long Count calendar in an Epi-Olmec script.\n*   Early Maya writing has been found at San Bartolo, dating back to 200-300 BCE.\n\nBased on this, the next steps should focus on clarifying the specific dates and the nature of the writing on these key artifacts. I need to get more specific information about the calendar systems used and how the dates are recorded.The previous steps have revealed a lot of information about potential early writing systems in Mesoamerica. Here's a summary of the findings and the plan going forward:\n\n**Key Findings:**\n\n*   **Cascajal Block (Olmec, ~900 BCE):** The dating is based on associated ceramics, and its status as true writing is debated. It does not contain a calendrical date.\n*   **San Andrés Cylinder Seal (Olmec, ~650 BCE):** Contains glyphs that some researchers interpret as \"3 Ajaw,\" a day in the 260-day calendar. This interpretation is not universally accepted.\n*   **San José Mogote Monument 3 (Zapotec, ~600 BCE):** Contains a glyph that is interpreted as the day name \"1 Earthquake\" in the 260-day calendar. There is some debate about the monument's date.\n*   **Chiapa de Corzo Stela 2 (Epi-Olmec, 36 BCE):** This artifact contains the oldest widely accepted Long Count calendar date, which is 7.16.3.2.13. This corresponds to a specific day in December 36 BCE.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n\nIt is now clear that the Chiapa de Corzo stela holds the earliest deciphered **specific date**. The other artifacts, while potentially older examples of writing, do not contain a date that can be definitively pinpointed to a single day in the same way the Long Count date on the Chiapa de Corzo stela can. The debates around the Cascajal Block and the San Andrés seal revolve around whether they represent true writing at all. While the San José Mogote monument likely contains a day name, the 260-day calendar is cyclical and doesn't anchor the date in a linear count like the Long Count. Therefore, I can now proceed to formulate the final answer.\n\nThe research is now sufficient to provide a comprehensive answer. The initial searches identified the key contenders for the earliest recorded date and the associated writing systems and civilizations. Subsequent research clarified the nature of these early records. The crucial distinction is between cyclical calendar notations and specific, absolute dates. While Olmec and Zapotec sites have earlier evidence of glyphs that may represent days in the 260-day calendar, these do not pinpoint a specific year. The Chiapa de Corzo stela, with its Long Count date, provides the earliest known specific date. I have gathered enough information to formulate a final answer that explains this distinction and presents the definitive earliest recorded date.\n\nThe earliest known specific date recorded by a pre-Columbian civilization in the Americas using an aboriginal writing system is **December 7, 36 BCE**. This date is inscribed on Stela 2 at the archaeological site of Chiapa de Corzo in Chiapas, Mexico, and is attributed to the Epi-Olmec civilization.\n\nThe inscription on Stela 2 utilizes the Mesoamerican Long Count calendar, a sophisticated system that allowed for the precise recording of dates over long periods. The date is recorded as 7.16.3.2.13, which correlates to the specific day in 36 BCE. This makes it the oldest confirmed Long Count date yet discovered. While other artifacts from civilizations like the Olmec and Zapotec may contain earlier forms of writing and calendrical notations, they do not represent a specific, absolute date in the same way the Long Count does.\n\nSeveral other artifacts are contenders for the earliest *writing* in general, but they do not feature a definitively deciphered date that can be pinpointed to a single day:\n\n*   **The Cascajal Block:** An Olmec artifact dated to around 900 BCE, it contains 62 glyphs. However, its authenticity and status as true writing are still debated among scholars, and it does not contain any calendrical information.\n*   **The San Andrés Cylinder Seal:** Another Olmec artifact, dated to about 650 BCE, features glyphs that some archaeologists interpret as \"3 Ajaw,\" a day in the 260-day sacred calendar. If this interpretation is correct, it would be the earliest known calendrical writing. However, the 260-day calendar is cyclical, so this inscription does not specify a particular year.\n*   **San José Mogote Monument 3:** This Zapotec monument, dated to around 600 BCE, displays a glyph interpreted as the day name \"1 Earthquake\" from the 260-day calendar. Similar to the San Andrés seal, this represents a day in a repeating cycle, not a fixed date in a linear count.\n\nTherefore, while the practice of writing and calendrical records existed earlier, the inscription on Stela 2 from Chiapa de Corzo remains the earliest known instance of a precise date being recorded in a pre-Columbian writing system.\n\n<<<December 7, 36 BCE>>>"
