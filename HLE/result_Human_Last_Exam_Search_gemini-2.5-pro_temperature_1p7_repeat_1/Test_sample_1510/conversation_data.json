    "There are **four** wallpaper groups with a point group of order 2.\n\nThe point groups of order 2 are the cyclic group C2 and the dihedral group D1. The wallpaper groups corresponding to these point groups are:\n\n*   **p2:** This group has a point group C2, which consists of a rotation of order 2 (180-degree rotation). It does not contain reflections or glide reflections.\n*   **pm:** This group has a point group D1, which represents a reflection.\n*   **pg:** This group also has a point group D1. In this case, the symmetry is represented by a glide reflection.\n*   **cm:** This group also has a point group D1, which includes a reflection.\n\nThese four groups (p2, pm, pg, and cm) are the only wallpaper groups whose point groups have an order of 2. Other wallpaper groups have point groups of different orders, such as order 1, 3, 4, 6, or 8.\n\n<<<4>>>"
