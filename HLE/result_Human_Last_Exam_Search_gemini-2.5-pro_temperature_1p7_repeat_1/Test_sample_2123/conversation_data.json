Auden played a significant role in helping Brodsky settle in the West.\n\nIn the Russian translation of the essay, when describing his time in Vienna, Brodsky mentions Auden's surname. Specifically, in \"To Please a Shadow,\" which was included in his collection of essays \"Less Than One,\" Brodsky recounts his meeting with Auden in Austria.\n\n<<<Auden>>>"
