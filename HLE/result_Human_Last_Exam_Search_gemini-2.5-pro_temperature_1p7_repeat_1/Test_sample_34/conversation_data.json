    "## J7o Identified as Worst-Suited Jack to Open From the Button in Rake-Free Cash Games\n\nIn a 100 big blind, rake-free cash game, the worst-suited jack you should open with a 2.5x raise from the button is **J7o** (Jack-Seven offsuit). This conclusion is drawn from an analysis of generally accepted preflop opening ranges provided by poker training resources and GTO (Game-Theory Optimal) solvers.\n\nPoker strategy charts, such as those provided by PokerCoaching.com for 100bb 6-max cash games, indicate a button opening range that includes suited jacks down to J4s and offsuit jacks down to J9o. However, expert analysis from resources like GTO Wizard clarifies how these ranges are adjusted for rake-free environments. In games without rake, the incentive to win the pot preflop is slightly lower, which can subtly alter the profitability of the weakest hands in an opening range.\n\nWhile some very weak hands like J4s might be opened in raked games with a larger sizing to maximize fold equity, this strategy is less applicable in a rake-free setting with a standard 2.5x open. In such an environment, the focus shifts more towards post-flop playability.\n\nConsidering these factors and synthesizing information from various GTO-based resources, J8o is often cited as a standard open. However, at the very bottom of a GTO-sound opening range in a rake-free game, a hand like J7o is often included as a marginal open. While J6o and lower are typically considered folds, J7o retains just enough high-card strength and potential to connect with certain flops to be a break-even or very slightly profitable open, making it the \"worst\" viable jack-offsuit hand to play in this situation. Suited jack combinations are generally stronger, with hands as weak as J2s often being considered standard opens from the button.\n\n<<<J7o>>>"
