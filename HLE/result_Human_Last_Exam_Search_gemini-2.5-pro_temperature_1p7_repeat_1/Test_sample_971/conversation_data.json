    "It is not possible to provide a definitive number of single-turn pirouettes en dehors from the fifth position that Natalia Osipova performed in the Act I variation of *Don Quixote* with the Bolshoi Ballet in 2008 based on available written records.\n\nNumerous reviews and articles from that period praise her performance as Kitri, frequently highlighting her exceptional turning ability. A Dance Magazine article from August 2008, for instance, notes that she tossed off \"multiple pirouettes with a laugh,\" and other analyses describe her variations as ending in a \"dizzying series of revolutions\".\n\nA key performance from that year, widely referenced and available on platforms like YouTube, is a guest appearance she made as Kitri in Novosibirsk, Siberia, while she was a soloist with the Bolshoi Ballet. While this video would hold the definitive answer to the number of pirouettes in that specific performance, a written breakdown or choreographic analysis that details the exact count of each step is not available. The number of turns in a ballet variation can also differ between performances, depending on the choreography and the dancer's interpretation on the day.\n\nTherefore, without a direct visual count of the specific 2008 performance, any number provided would be speculative.\n\n<<<I am unable to provide a specific number for the pirouettes based on the textual search results.>>>"
