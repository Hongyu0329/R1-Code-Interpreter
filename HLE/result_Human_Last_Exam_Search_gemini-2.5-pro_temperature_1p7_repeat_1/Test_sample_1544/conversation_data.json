    "Analyzing the chess position represented by the FEN string `8/3p4/1kpP4/p1q5/P7/8/5Q2/6K1 w - - 0 1`, the optimal move for White is clear. White's objective is to capitalize on the powerful passed pawn on d6.\n\nThe move that secures a decisive advantage is for the White queen to capture the Black queen. After this capture, Black is forced to recapture with the b-pawn, which then allows White's d-pawn to advance and promote to a new queen. This sequence of moves leads to a winning endgame for White.\n\n<<<Qxc5+>>>"
