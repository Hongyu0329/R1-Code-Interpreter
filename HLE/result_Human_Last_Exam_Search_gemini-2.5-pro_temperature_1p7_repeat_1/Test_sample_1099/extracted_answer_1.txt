To simulate the correlations from a set of POVM measurements on a singlet bipartite quantum state with a local hidden variable model, the minimal resources required on average are **2 bits of classical communication**. Alternatively, in terms of non-local resources, a finite number of **non-signaling PR-boxes** is sufficient, with the exact minimal number depending on the specific set of POVMs but being greater than or equal to one. For the specific case of projective measurements, a subclass of POVMs, the minimal resources are **1 bit of classical communication** or **1 non-signaling PR-box**.
