    "The cardinality of the set of continuous functions $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ that satisfy the equation $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$ is the cardinality of the continuum, denoted by $\\mathfrak{c}$ or $2^{\\aleph_0}$.\n\nHere is a justification for this result:\n\nFirst, any solution $f$ must be an injective function. If $f(x_1) = f(x_2)$, then applying $f$ to both sides gives $f(f(x_1)) = f(f(x_2))$, which by the given equation means $\\exp(x_1) = \\exp(x_2)$. Since the exponential function is injective, this implies $x_1 = x_2$.\n\nA continuous and injective function from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$ must be strictly monotonic. Let's analyze the two cases for a potential solution $f$:\n\n1.  **$f$ is strictly decreasing:** If $f$ is strictly decreasing, then the composition $f \\circ f$ is strictly increasing. The function $g(x) = \\exp(x)$ is strictly increasing, so this case is plausible. However, for a solution $f$ to exist, we have $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x) > 0$ for all real $x$. This means that the range of the outer function $f$ is a subset of the positive real numbers. For $f$ to be a bijection from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$, its range must be all of $\\mathbb{R}$. A strictly decreasing function defined on all of $\\mathbb{R}$ cannot have a range that is strictly positive, as it must tend to $+\\infty$ in one direction and $-\\infty$ in the other, thus taking on negative values. Therefore, no strictly decreasing continuous solution exists.\n\n2.  **$f$ is strictly increasing:** If $f$ is strictly increasing, then $f \\circ f$ is also strictly increasing, which is consistent with the properties of $\\exp(x)$. Solutions of this type are known to exist and are sometimes referred to as \"half-exponential functions\".\n\nThe cardinality of the set of these solutions can be determined by considering a method for their construction. A standard way to construct these functions is to define the function on a specific interval and then extend it to the entire real line using the functional equation.\n\nHere's a sketch of the construction that shows the cardinality:\n*   Choose a real number $a$ such that $0 < a < 1$.\n*   Define $f(0) = a$. From the functional equation, we must have $f(f(0)) = \\exp(0)$, which implies $f(a) = 1$.\n*   We can now define $f$ on the interval $[0, a]$ as any continuous, strictly increasing function that satisfies $f(0) = a$ and $f(a) = 1$. There is a continuum of choices for such a function. For instance, for any real number $c > 0$, the function $h_c(x) = a + (1-a)\\left(\\frac{x}{a}\\right)^c$ is a valid choice for $f$ on $[0, a]$. Each different value of $c$ yields a distinct function.\n*   Once $f$ is defined on $[0, a]$, its definition can be extended to all of $\\mathbb{R}$ by repeatedly using the relations $f(x) = \\exp(f^{-1}(x))$ for $x > a$ and $f(x) = f^{-1}(\\exp(x))$ for $x < 0$. Each unique choice of the initial function on $[0, a]$ leads to a unique continuous solution over $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\nSince there are at least as many solutions as there are choices for the initial function segment (which is $\\mathfrak{c}$, the cardinality of the real numbers), there are at least $\\mathfrak{c}$ solutions.\n\nThe set of all continuous functions from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$ is known to have cardinality $\\mathfrak{c}$. Since the set of solutions is a subset of the set of all continuous functions, its cardinality cannot be greater than $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n\nBy the Cantor-Bernstein theorem, since the cardinality is both at least $\\mathfrak{c}$ and at most $\\mathfrak{c}$, it must be exactly $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n\n<<<$\\mathfrak{c}$>>>"
