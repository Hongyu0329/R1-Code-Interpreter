    "The symmetry group of the optimal packing of 1135 congruent circles in a circle is C_1 in Schoenflies notation. This is based on the data compiled by Eckard Specht in \"The best known packings of equal circles in a circle\".\n\nIn this comprehensive dataset, the symmetry group for each packing is provided. For the packing of 1135 circles, the entry for the symmetry group is blank. The legend accompanying the data table explicitly states that a blank field in the symmetry group column indicates a symmetry element of C_1. This signifies that the arrangement of the circles lacks any rotational or reflectional symmetry.\n\n<<<C_1>>>"
