    "The first statute in the modern State of Israel to explicitly introduce the concept of \"good faith\" as a general principle in contract law was the Contracts (General Part) Law. Enacted in 1973, this law marked a significant shift in Israeli jurisprudence, which had previously been more aligned with the English common law tradition that does not contain a general duty to act in good faith.\n\nThe Contracts (General Part) Law introduced the principle of \"good faith\" in two key sections:\n\n*   **Section 12**, which mandates that parties act in a customary manner and in good faith during the negotiations leading to a contract.\n*   **Section 39**, which requires that any right or obligation arising from a contract be exercised and fulfilled in a customary manner and in good faith.\n\nThis legislative innovation established \"good faith\" as a fundamental tenet of Israeli contract law, applicable to both the pre-contractual and performance stages of an agreement. It was influenced by continental legal systems, particularly German law, and represented a move towards a more codified civil law approach in this area.\n\nWhile other laws prior to 1973, such as the Sale Law of 1968, may have touched upon related concepts in specific contexts like a good faith purchase, the Contracts (General Part) Law was the first to establish \"good faith\" as an explicit and overarching principle governing contractual relationships in Israel. The earlier Contract (Remedies for Breach of Contract) Law of 1970 does not contain this explicit general provision.\n\n<<<Contracts (General Part) Law>>>"
