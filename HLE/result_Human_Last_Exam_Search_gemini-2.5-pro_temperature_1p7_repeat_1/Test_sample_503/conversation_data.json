    "An internal adjunction in the simplex category $\\Delta$, viewed as a locally posetal 2-subcategory of $\\mathsf{Pos}$, consists of a pair of order-preserving maps (morphisms) $f: [m] \\to [n]$ and $g: [n] \\to [m]$ that form an adjunction between the posets $[m]$ and $[n]$. Here, $[k]$ denotes the finite ordinal $\\{0, 1, \\dots, k\\}$ equipped with its standard order. The map $f$ is the left adjoint and $g$ is the right adjoint.\n\nFor $f$ and $g$ to form an adjunction, they must satisfy the condition:\n$f(x) \\le y \\iff x \\le g(y)$ for all $x \\in [m]$ and $y \\in [n]$.\n\nThis is equivalent to the following two conditions on the compositions:\n1.  $\\mathrm{id}_{[m]} \\le g \\circ f$, which means $x \\le g(f(x))$ for all $x \\in [m]$.\n2.  $f \\circ g \\le \\mathrm{id}_{[n]}$, which means $f(g(y)) \\le y$ for all $y \\in [n]$.\n\nAn adjunction is uniquely determined by either its left adjoint or its right adjoint. Therefore, the number of adjunctions is the number of possible left adjoints $f: \\to$ or, equivalently, the number of possible right adjoints $g: \\to$.\n\nAn order-preserving map $f: [m] \\to [n]$ is a left adjoint if and only if it has a right adjoint. For a map between posets, a right adjoint $g$ exists if the expression $g(y) = \\sup \\{x \\in [m] \\mid f(x) \\le y\\}$ is well-defined for all $y \\in [n]$. In a finite poset like $[m]$, any non-empty subset has a supremum (its maximum element). However, if the set $\\{x \\in [m] \\mid f(x) \\le y\\}$ is empty, its supremum is not defined within the set. To ensure this set is never empty, we must have that for any $y \\in [n]$, there is an $x \\in [m]$ with $f(x) \\le y$. Since $f$ is order-preserving, the smallest value it can output is $f(0)$. So, we need $f(0) \\le y$ for all $y \\in [n]$. This is only possible if $f(0)$ is the minimum element of $[n]$, which is 0.\nThus, an order-preserving map $f: [m] \\to [n]$ is a left adjoint if and only if $f(0)=0$.\n\nDually, an order-preserving map $g: [n] \\to [m]$ is a right adjoint if and only if its left adjoint exists. The left adjoint $f$ is given by $f(x) = \\inf \\{y \\in [n] \\mid x \\le g(y)\\}$. This requires the set $\\{y \\in [n] \\mid x \\le g(y)\\}$ to be non-empty for all $x \\in [m]$. This means for any $x \\in [m]$, there must be a $y \\in [n]$ such that $x \\le g(y)$. Taking $x=m$, the maximum element of $[m]$, we need an element $y \\in [n]$ such that $m \\le g(y)$. Since the codomain of $g$ is $[m]$, this implies $g(y)=m$. As $g$ is order-preserving, this condition is met if and only if $g(n)=m$.\nThus, an order-preserving map $g: [n] \\to [m]$ is a right adjoint if and only if $g(n)=m$.\n\nSo, the problem is to count the number of order-preserving maps $f: \\to$ satisfying $f(0)=0$.\nLet $m=23$ and $n=37$. An order-preserving map $f$ is a sequence $f(0), f(1), \\dots, f(23)$ such that $0 \\le f(0) \\le f(1) \\le \\dots \\le f(23) \\le 37$.\nThe condition $f(0)=0$ fixes the first element of the sequence. We need to count the number of non-decreasing sequences $f(1), f(2), \\dots, f(23)$ of length 23, where each element is chosen from $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 37\\}$.\nThis is a problem of choosing $m=23$ items from a set of $n+1=38$ items with replacement, where the order of selection does not matter (as it's fixed by the non-decreasing condition). This is a classic stars-and-bars problem. The number of such maps is given by the multiset coefficient formula $\\left(\\!\\!{k \\choose r}\\!\\!\\right) = \\binom{k+r-1}{r}$, where we choose $r$ items from a set of $k$.\nHere, the number of items to choose is $r=m=23$.\nThe size of the set from which we choose is $k=n+1=38$.\nThe number of such sequences is $\\binom{(n+1)+m-1}{m} = \\binom{n+m}{m}$.\n\nFor $m=23$ and $n=37$, the number is:\n$\\binom{37+23}{23} = \\binom{60}{23}$\n\nAlternatively, we can count the number of right-adjoint maps $g: \\to$ satisfying $g(37)=23$.\nLet $m=23, n=37$. This is counting non-decreasing sequences $g(0), g(1), \\dots, g(37)$ where $g(i) \\in$ and $g(37)=23$.\nThis means we need to choose the values $g(0), g(1), \\dots, g(36)$ such that $0 \\le g(0) \\le \\dots \\le g(36) \\le 23$.\nThis is a choice of $n=37$ items from a set of $m+1=24$ items with replacement. The number of ways is:\n$\\binom{(m+1)+n-1}{n} = \\binom{m+n}{n} = \\binom{23+37}{37} = \\binom{60}{37}$.\nUsing the identity $\\binom{N}{k} = \\binom{N}{N-k}$, we have $\\binom{60}{23} = \\binom{60}{60-23} = \\binom{60}{37}$. The results are consistent.\n\nThe number of adjunctions is $\\binom{60}{23}$. Let's compute this value.\n$\\binom{60}{23} = \\frac{60!}{23!(60-23)!} = \\frac{60!}{23!37!}$\nThis number is $585,336,335,104,734,580$.\n\n<<<585336335104734580>>>"
