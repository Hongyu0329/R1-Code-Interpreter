    "To determine the number of double points in the stable reduction of the curve $y^2 = 8x+x^2+4x^3+4x^4+8x^5$ over the 2-adic numbers ($\\mathbb{Q}_2$), we analyze the structure of its stable model. The number of double points in the stable reduction is equal to the first Betti number of the dual graph of the special fiber of the stable model.\n\nThe given curve is a hyperelliptic curve of genus $g=2$, since the polynomial in $x$ has degree 5. The stable reduction of a curve is a semistable curve, meaning its only singularities are nodes (double points).\n\nThe structure of the stable reduction is determined by the clustering of the branch points of the curve over the 2-adic field. The branch points are the roots of the polynomial $f(x) = 8x^5 + 4x^4 + 4x^3 + x^2 + 8x$, plus the point at infinity, as the degree is odd.\n\nFirst, we find the 2-adic valuations of the roots of $f(x)=0$.\nThe polynomial can be factored as $f(x) = x(8x^4 + 4x^4 + 4x^3 + x + 8)$. One root is $r_0 = 0$.\nLet $g(x) = 8x^4 + 4x^3 + 4x^2 + x + 8$. We use the Newton polygon method to find the valuations of the roots of $g(x)$. The vertices of the Newton polygon are determined by the 2-adic valuations of the coefficients of $g(x)$.\nThe coefficients are $a_4=8, a_3=4, a_2=4, a_1=1, a_0=8$.\nTheir 2-adic valuations are $v_2(a_4)=3, v_2(a_3)=2, v_2(a_2)=2, v_2(a_1)=0, v_2(a_0)=3$.\nThe points for the Newton polygon are $(i, v_2(a_i))$: $(4,3), (3,2), (2,2), (1,0), (0,3)$.\n\nThe lower convex hull of these points consists of two segments:\n1.  A segment from $(0,3)$ to $(1,0)$. The slope is $(0-3)/(1-0) = -3$. The horizontal length is 1. This corresponds to one root, let's call it $r_1$, with valuation $v_2(r_1) = -(-3) = 3$.\n2.  A segment from $(1,0)$ to $(4,3)$. The slope is $(3-0)/(4-1) = 1$. The horizontal length is 3. This corresponds to three roots, $r_2, r_3, r_4$, each with valuation $v_2(r_i) = -(1) = -1$ for $i=2,3,4$.\n\nSo, the finite branch points are $\\{0, r_1, r_2, r_3, r_4\\}$ with valuations $v_2(0)=\\infty, v_2(r_1)=3, v_2(r_2)=v_2(r_3)=v_2(r_4)=-1$. The sixth branch point is at infinity.\n\nThe stable reduction is determined by a partition of the six branch points $B = \\{0, r_1, r_2, r_3, r_4, \\infty\\}$ into clusters. Two branch points $e_i, e_j$ are considered \"close\" and belong to the same cluster if the 2-adic valuation $v_2(e_i - e_j)$ is large and positive.\n\nLet's analyze the pairwise distances:\n*   $v_2(0 - r_1) = v_2(r_1) = 3$. This indicates $0$ and $r_1$ form a cluster.\n*   $v_2(0 - r_i) = v_2(r_i) = -1$ for $i \\in \\{2,3,4\\}$. These are \"far\" from 0.\n*   $v_2(r_1 - r_i) = \\min(v_2(r_1), v_2(r_i)) = \\min(3, -1) = -1$ for $i \\in \\{2,3,4\\}$. These are \"far\" from $r_1$.\n\nThis suggests that $\\{0, r_1\\}$ forms one cluster, while $\\{r_2, r_3, r_4\\}$ are separate from it. To understand the clustering of $\\{r_2, r_3, r_4\\}$ with $\\infty$, we transform the curve by $x=1/X$. The new equation is $y^2 = X^{-5} (8 + X + 4X^2 + 4X^3 + 8X^4)$. After a suitable change of variables $Y=yX^3$, we get $Y^2 = X(8X^4 + X^3 + 4X^2 + 4X + 8)$. The branch point $x=\\infty$ corresponds to $X=0$. The other roots $R_i$ are the reciprocals of the original roots, $R_i=1/r_i$.\nTheir valuations are $v_2(R_1) = -3$ and $v_2(R_{2,3,4}) = 1$.\nSince $v_2(R_{2,3,4}) = 1 > 0$, the roots $R_2, R_3, R_4$ are close to 0 in this new coordinate system. This means the original roots $r_2, r_3, r_4$ form a cluster with $\\infty$.\n\nThe set of six branch points $B$ is therefore partitioned into two sets:\n*   $B_1 = \\{0, r_1\\}$\n*   $B_2 = \\{r_2, r_3, r_4, \\infty\\}$\n\nThis partition determines the stable reduction. The stable reduction consists of two components, $C_1$ and $C_2$, corresponding to the sets $B_1$ and $B_2$. The genus $g_i$ of each component $C_i$ is given by the formula $g_i = (|B_i| - 2) / 2$.\n*   For $C_1$: $g_1 = (|B_1| - 2) / 2 = (2-2)/2 = 0$. So $C_1$ is a rational curve ($\\mathbb{P}^1$).\n*   For $C_2$: $g_2 = (|B_2| - 2) / 2 = (4-2)/2 = 1$. So $C_2$ is an elliptic curve.\n\nThe arithmetic genus of the stable fiber, which must equal the genus of the original curve ($g=2$), is given by the formula:\n$p_a = g_1 + g_2 + \\delta - V + 1$\nwhere $\\delta$ is the number of double points (nodes) and $V$ is the number of components.\nHere, $g=2$, $g_1=0$, $g_2=1$, and $V=2$.\n$2 = 0 + 1 + \\delta - 2 + 1$\n$2 = \\delta$\n\nThus, the stable reduction of the curve has 2 double points. These nodes are the intersection points of the rational component and the elliptic component.\n\n<<<2>>>"
