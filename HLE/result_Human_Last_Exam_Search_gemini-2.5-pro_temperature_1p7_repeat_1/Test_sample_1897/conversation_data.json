    "The initial search for the closed form of the infinite product has returned several results related to the Jacobi triple product and Ramanujan theta functions. These are highly relevant as the product in question is of a form that often appears in these theories. The key is to correctly identify the parameters in the general formulas. Let's analyze the product and relate it to the standard forms.\n\nThe product is $\\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1-e^{-(2n+1)\\pi})$. Let $q = e^{-\\pi}$. Then the product becomes $\\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1-q^{2n+1})$.\n\nThis is a specific instance of a q-Pochhammer symbol $(q;q^2)_\\infty$. The Jacobi triple product identity, as stated in various forms in the search results, provides a way to express such products as a series. The Ramanujan theta function is also closely related.\n\nLet's use the q-Pochhammer symbol notation. The given product is $(q; q^2)_{\\infty}$ with $q=e^{-\\pi}$. I need to find a known identity for this specific q-Pochhammer symbol.\n\nI will perform a new search focused on the evaluation of $(q;q^2)_\\infty$ and its relation to other mathematical constants. I will also look for evaluations of theta functions or q-series at the specific value $q=e^{-\\pi}$. This value, known as the nome, is significant in the theory of elliptic functions and modular forms.\n\nBased on this refined strategy, I will proceed to the next step.The search results confirm that the infinite product is related to Jacobi theta functions and the Dedekind eta function. Specifically, the product $\\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1-e^{-(2n+1)\\pi})$ is a q-Pochhammer symbol of the form $(q;q^2)_\\infty$ where $q=e^{-\\pi}$. The key to finding a closed-form expression is to relate this to special values of these functions.\n\nFrom the search results, I've gathered several important identities. One of the key relations is the connection between the q-Pochhammer symbol and the Jacobi theta functions. For instance, the Jacobi triple product identity relates products like these to sums. Also, the Dedekind eta function, $\\eta(\\tau) = q^{1/24} \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty} (1-q^n)$ where $q = e^{2\\pi i \\tau}$, has known special values at imaginary quadratic arguments.\n\nLet's try to express the given product in terms of the Dedekind eta function. The product is $\\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1-q^{2n+1}) = \\frac{\\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}(1-q^n)}{\\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}(1-q^{2n})}$. With $q = e^{-\\pi}$, this corresponds to a specific value of $\\tau$. Let $q = e^{2\\pi i \\tau}$, so $e^{-\\pi} = e^{2\\pi i \\tau}$, which gives $-\\pi = 2\\pi i \\tau$, and thus $\\tau = i/2$.\n\nThe product can be written in terms of the eta function as:\n$\\frac{\\eta(\\tau)}{\\eta(2\\tau)} \\cdot e^{\\pi i \\tau/12} / e^{\\pi i (2\\tau)/12} = \\frac{\\eta(i/2)}{\\eta(i)} \\cdot e^{-\\pi i \\tau / 12} = \\frac{\\eta(i/2)}{\\eta(i)} \\cdot e^{\\pi/24}$.\n\nTherefore, the problem is reduced to finding the values of $\\eta(i/2)$ and $\\eta(i)$. These are known values that can be expressed in terms of Gamma functions.\n\nI will now execute a final search to confirm the values of $\\eta(i/2)$ and $\\eta(i)$ and then assemble the final answer.The infinite product is given by $\\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1-e^{-(2n+1)\\pi})$.\nLet $q = e^{-\\pi}$. The product can be written as $\\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1-q^{2n+1})$.\nThis is a q-Pochhammer symbol, specifically $(q;q^2)_{\\infty}$.\n\nWe can express this in terms of the Dedekind eta function, which is defined as $\\eta(\\tau) = q^{1/24}\\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}(1-q^n)$, where $q = e^{2\\pi i \\tau}$.\nOur product is $\\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1-q^{2n+1}) = \\frac{\\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}(1-q^n)}{\\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}(1-q^{2n})}$.\nWith $q = e^{-\\pi}$, we have $e^{-\\pi} = e^{2\\pi i \\tau}$, which gives $\\tau = \\frac{-\\pi}{2\\pi i} = \\frac{i}{2}$.\nThen $q^2 = e^{-2\\pi}$ corresponds to $e^{-2\\pi} = e^{2\\pi i (2\\tau)}$, which means the second product corresponds to $\\eta(2\\tau) = \\eta(i)$.\n\nThe product is equal to\n$$ \\frac{q^{-1/24}\\eta(\\tau)}{q^{-2/24}\\eta(2\\tau)} = q^{1/24} \\frac{\\eta(\\tau)}{\\eta(2\\tau)} = e^{-\\pi/24} \\frac{\\eta(i/2)}{\\eta(i)} $$\nThe values of the eta function at these points are known. Specifically,\n$$ \\eta(i) = \\frac{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)}{2\\pi^{3/4}} $$\nand\n$$ \\eta(i/2) = \\frac{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)}{2^{5/8}\\pi^{3/4}} $$\nSubstituting these values into our expression gives:\n$$ e^{-\\pi/24} \\frac{\\frac{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)}{2^{5/8}\\pi^{3/4}}}{\\frac{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)}{2\\pi^{3/4}}} = e^{-\\pi/24} \\frac{2}{2^{5/8}} = 2^{1 - 5/8} e^{-\\pi/24} = 2^{3/8} e^{-\\pi/24} $$\n\n"
