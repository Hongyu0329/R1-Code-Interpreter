    "On Sir Isaac Newton's color circle, the seven colors of the spectrum are associated with the seven notes of a musical scale. Newton used the Dorian mode starting on the note D. The color produced by mixing yellow and blue pigments is green, and on Newton's spectral color circle, green is located between yellow and blue.\n\nThe sequence of colors and their corresponding notes in the D-Dorian scale is as follows:\n*   **Red** corresponds to **D**\n*   **Orange** corresponds to **E**\n*   **Yellow** corresponds to **F**\n*   **Green** corresponds to **G**\n*   **Blue** corresponds to **A**\n*   **Indigo** corresponds to **B**\n*   **Violet** corresponds to **C**\n\nThe question asks for the musical note that corresponds to the range between the color produced when combining yellow and blue (which is green) and blue itself. This range on the color circle, from green to blue, is associated with the musical notes G and A. The note that represents the beginning of this range, corresponding to the color green, is G.\n\n<<<G>>>"
