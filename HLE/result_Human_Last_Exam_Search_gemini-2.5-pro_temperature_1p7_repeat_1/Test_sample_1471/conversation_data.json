    "To solve the equation, each Roman numeral must first be converted into a modern Arabic numeral.\n\nBased on the search results, the values are as follows:\n*   **CXCIX:** This Roman numeral is composed of C (100), XC (90), and IX (9). Adding these values together gives 100 + 90 + 9, which equals 199.\n*   **LXXXIX:** This Roman numeral breaks down into L (50), XXX (30), and IX (9). The sum of these parts, 50 + 30 + 9, is 89.\n\nThe term \"NIV\" does not correspond to a standard Roman numeral. In the Roman numeral system, letters such as I, V, X, L, C, D, and M are used to represent numbers. Since \"N\" is not one of these standard letters, \"NIV\" does not have a defined numerical value in this system.\n\nTherefore, without a valid numerical value for \"NIV,\" the equation cannot be solved.\n\n<<<cannot be solved>>>"
