    "The smallest possible rank of the Néron-Severi group of X is 2, and the largest is 10.\n\nLet C be a smooth, projective curve of genus `g`, and let X = Symᵈ(C) be its d-th symmetric power. For `d ≥ g - 1`, the rank of the Néron-Severi group of X, denoted ρ(X), is related to the rank of the Néron-Severi group of the Jacobian of C, ρ(Jac(C)), by the formula:\n\nρ(X) = ρ(Jac(C)) + 1.\n\nIn this problem, C is a genus 3 curve (`g=3`), and X is its 15th symmetric power (`d=15`). Since `15 ≥ 3 - 1`, the formula is applicable. Therefore, the problem reduces to determining the smallest and largest possible values of ρ(Jac(C)) for a genus 3 curve.\n\nThe Jacobian of a genus 3 curve, Jac(C), is a 3-dimensional abelian variety. The rank of the Néron-Severi group of a g-dimensional abelian variety A, ρ(A), is bounded by `1 ≤ ρ(A) ≤ h¹¹(A)`, where `h¹¹(A)` is the (1,1)-Hodge number. For a g-dimensional abelian variety, `h¹¹(A) = g²`. In our case, `g=3`, so `h¹¹(Jac(C)) = 3² = 9`.\n\n**Smallest Rank:**\nThe minimum rank is achieved for a \"very generic\" curve C. In this context, \"generic\" means that the Jacobian variety Jac(C) is simple and its ring of endomorphisms is as small as possible, i.e., isomorphic to the integers ℤ. For such an abelian variety, the Néron-Severi group is generated by the class of the theta divisor (the principal polarization), and its rank is 1. The existence of such generic curves for any genus is a well-established fact.\n\nThus, the smallest possible rank for ρ(Jac(C)) is 1. This gives the smallest possible rank for X as:\nρ_min(X) = 1 + 1 = 2.\n\n**Largest Rank:**\nThe maximum rank, ρ(A) = h¹¹(A), is achieved for abelian varieties with sufficiently many endomorphisms, known as abelian varieties of CM-type (Complex Multiplication). For a g-dimensional abelian variety to be of CM-type, its endomorphism algebra must contain a field of degree 2g.\n\nFor `g=3`, this requires Jac(C) to have CM by a field of degree 6. The existence of genus 3 curves whose Jacobians are of CM-type is well-known. A classic example is the Fermat quartic curve, defined by the equation x⁴ + y⁴ + z⁴ = 0, whose Jacobian has complex multiplication. For such a curve, all Hodge classes on its Jacobian are algebraic, meaning the rank of the Néron-Severi group attains its maximum possible value.\n\nThus, the largest possible rank for ρ(Jac(C)) is `h¹¹(Jac(C)) = 9`. This yields the largest possible rank for X as:\nρ_max(X) = 9 + 1 = 10.\n\nTherefore, the rank of the Néron-Severi group of X can range from 2 to 10, depending on the choice of the genus 3 curve C.\n\n<<<The smallest possible rank is 2 and the largest possible rank is 10.>>>"
