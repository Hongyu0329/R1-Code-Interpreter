    "### Ideal Ni/Ce Ratio in Ni-Ceria Nanoparticles for Catalytic Applications\n\nThe optimal ratio of nickel (Ni) to cerium (Ce) in Ni-Ceria (Ni-CeO₂) nanoparticles is highly dependent on the specific catalytic reaction, with different ratios maximizing performance for the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction versus water splitting.\n\n#### Water Gas Shift (WGS) Reaction\n\nFor the Water Gas Shift reaction (CO + H₂O → CO₂ + H₂), studies indicate that a broad range of Ni concentrations can yield high catalytic activity, rather than a single, sharply-defined optimal ratio. Research has shown that Ni-Ceria catalysts with a nickel content ranging from **5 to 15 atomic or weight percent** are effective.\n\nOne study found no significant difference in performance for Ni content between 5 to 12.5 wt%. Specifically, at 400°C, the CO conversion rates for catalysts with 10 wt% and 12.5 wt% Ni were nearly identical at 94.7% and 95.3%, respectively. This suggests that within this range, the catalytic activity is high, though excessively high Ni loading can lead to the formation of less active, larger NiO particles. Therefore, a moderate nickel concentration is generally favored to ensure high dispersion and strong interaction with the ceria support.\n\n#### Water Splitting (WS)\n\nThe ideal Ni/Ce ratio for water splitting is more specific and depends on the particular half-reaction being catalyzed, namely the Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER) or the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER), which are the two key steps in electrocatalytic water splitting.\n\n*   **Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER):** For the OER, which is often the rate-limiting step in water splitting, a nickel-rich composition is generally more effective. A study that systematically varied the Ni/Ce molar ratios found that catalysts with a **Ni to Ce molar ratio between 3:1 (Ni₇₅Ce₂₅Oₓ) and 1:1 (Ni₅₀Ce₅₀Oₓ)** demonstrated the highest OER activity. This enhanced performance is attributed to a higher concentration of beneficial oxygen vacancies. A separate computational study reinforces this, suggesting that a **3Ni to 1Ce ratio** leads to more favorable adsorption energies and superior catalytic properties for the overall water-splitting reaction.\n\n*   **Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER):** In contrast to the OER, a ceria-rich composition appears to be optimal for the HER. Research on Ni₃N-CeO₂ catalysts revealed that a **Ce to Ni molar ratio of 2:1** (denoted as Ni₃N-2CeO₂/NF) exhibited the best HER performance.\n\nIn the context of **thermochemical water splitting**, while Ni-Ceria catalysts are studied, the literature often includes other dopants, making it difficult to pinpoint an ideal Ni/Ce ratio for the base material alone. However, one study did note high performance for CO₂ splitting, a related reaction, using a 2% Ni/CeO₂ catalyst.\n\nIn summary, there is no single ideal Ni/Ce ratio that maximizes catalytic performance for both the WGS reaction and water splitting. For the WGS reaction, a broader range of 5-15% nickel content is effective. For electrocatalytic water splitting, a Ni-rich ratio (e.g., 3:1) is best for the oxygen evolution half-reaction, while a Ce-rich ratio (e.g., 2:1) is preferred for the hydrogen evolution half-reaction.\n\n<<<For the Water Gas Shift reaction, a nickel content of 5-15% is effective. For water splitting, the ideal Ni/Ce molar ratio is approximately 3:1 for the Oxygen Evolution Reaction and 1:2 for the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction.>>>"
