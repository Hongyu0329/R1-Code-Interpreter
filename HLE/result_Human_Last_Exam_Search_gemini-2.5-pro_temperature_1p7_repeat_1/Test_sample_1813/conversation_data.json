    "To compute the continued fraction associated with the generalized Markov number \\( m_{4/7} \\), we need to find the continued fraction of the quadratic irrationality \\(\\alpha_{4/7}\\) that is \"worst-approximable\" with the asymmetry \\(4/7\\). The continued fraction of this number is known to be purely periodic, of the form \\([0; \\overline{B}]\\), where \\(B\\) is a palindromic block of integers.\n\nThe construction of the block \\(B\\) is based on the continued fraction of the rational number \\(p/q\\), in this case, \\(4/7\\).\n\nFirst, we compute the continued fraction of \\(4/7\\):\n\\( \\frac{4}{7} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{7}{4}} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{3}{4}} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{1}{\\frac{4}{3}}} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{1}{3}}} \\)\nSo, the continued fraction of \\(4/7\\) is \\([0; 1, 1, 3]\\). We denote the coefficients as \\(c_1=1, c_2=1, c_3=3\\).\n\nNext, we use a recursive algorithm developed by Freiman and Berstein to construct the palindromic block \\(B = V_{m-1}\\) where \\(m=3\\) is the number of coefficients. The algorithm defines two sequences of integer blocks, \\(U_k\\) and \\(V_k\\):\n\n*   **Initialization (k=0):**\n    *   \\(U_0 = ()\\) (the empty block)\n    *   \\(V_0 = (c_1) = (1)\\)\n\n*   **Step 1 (k=1):** We use \\(c_2=1\\).\n    *   \\(U_1 = V_0 c_2 = (1, 1)\\)\n    *   \\(V_1 = V_0 c_2 \\tilde{U}_0 = (1, 1)\\) (since \\(\\tilde{U}_0\\), the reverse of \\(U_0\\), is empty)\n\n*   **Step 2 (k=2):** This is the final step as \\(k = m-1\\). We use \\(c_3=3\\).\n    *   \\(U_2 = V_1 c_3 = (1, 1, 3)\\)\n    *   \\(V_2 = V_1 c_3 \\tilde{U}_1 = (1, 1, 3)\\) concatenated with the reverse of \\(U_1\\), which is \\((1,1)\\).\n    *   So, \\(V_2 = (1, 1, 3, 1, 1)\\).\n\nThe resulting block \\(B = V_2\\) is a palindrome, as expected.\n\nThe continued fraction associated with the generalized Markov number \\( m_{4/7} \\) is given by the repeating block we have computed.\n\n<<<The continued fraction is \\([0; \\overline{1, 1, 3, 1, 1}]\\).>>>"
