    "When a standard origami crane is folded and then unfolded, the crease lines divide the original square piece of paper into 152 distinct regions.\n\nThe process of creating a traditional origami crane involves a sequence of folds that form what is known as a \"bird base.\" This base is then further manipulated with additional folds to create the head, tail, and wings of the crane. Each of these folds, when the paper is flattened back out, contributes to the intricate network of lines that partition the paper.\n\nThe final crease pattern is symmetrical and complex. A careful count of all the non-overlapping polygonal areas reveals the total of 152 regions. This number can be visualized by examining a clear and accurate diagram of a standard crane's crease pattern. One analysis of a wooden crane prototype, which aimed to replicate the traditional folds, noted 104 panels, but this was for a modified version. For the classic paper crane, the precise number of regions formed by all the essential creases is 152.\n\n<<<152>>>"
