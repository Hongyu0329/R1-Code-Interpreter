    "The problem asks for the minimal number of generators of the fundamental group of the double branched cover of $S^4$ over the 5-twist-spun knot of the trefoil.\n\nFirst, we must identify the fundamental group of this specific 4-manifold. Let $K$ denote the 5-twist-spun knot of the trefoil, which is a smoothly embedded 2-sphere in the 4-sphere, $S^4$. Let $X$ be the double branched cover of $S^4$ over $K$. The fundamental group of the complement of the knot, $\\pi_1(S^4 \\setminus K)$, is known as the knot group.\n\nAccording to the work of E. C. Zeeman, the group of the 5-twist-spun trefoil knot is the direct product of the binary dodecahedral group, denoted as $G$, and the infinite cyclic group $\\mathbb{Z}$. The binary dodecahedral group is also isomorphic to the special linear group $SL(2,5)$ and has an order of 120. Thus, we have:\n$\\pi_1(S^4 \\setminus K) \\cong G \\times \\mathbb{Z}$\n\nThe fundamental group of the double branched cover, $\\pi_1(X)$, is the kernel of the homomorphism $\\phi: \\pi_1(S^4 \\setminus K) \\to \\mathbb{Z}_2$, where $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ is the cyclic group of order 2. This homomorphism maps a meridian of the knot to the non-trivial element of $\\mathbb{Z}_2$. In the direct product structure $G \\times \\mathbb{Z}$, the generator of the $\\mathbb{Z}$ factor corresponds to the meridian.\n\nTherefore, the homomorphism acts as $\\phi(g, k) = k \\pmod 2$ for any element $(g, k) \\in G \\times \\mathbb{Z}$. The kernel of this map consists of all elements for which the $\\mathbb{Z}$ component is an even integer. This subgroup is $G \\times 2\\mathbb{Z}$. The group of even integers, $2\\mathbb{Z}$, is isomorphic to the group of all integers, $\\mathbb{Z}$. Consequently, the fundamental group of the double branched cover is:\n$\\pi_1(X) \\cong G \\times \\mathbb{Z} \\cong SL(2,5) \\times \\mathbb{Z}$\n\nNext, we must find the minimal number of generators for this group, a quantity denoted by $d(SL(2,5) \\times \\mathbb{Z})$.\nFor a finitely generated group $H$, the minimal number of generators for the direct product $H \\times \\mathbb{Z}$ is related to the minimal number of generators for $H$, $d(H)$, and its abelianization, $H_{ab} = H/[H,H]$. A known result states that $d(H \\times \\mathbb{Z}) = d(H)$ if $d(H_{ab}) < d(H)$, and $d(H \\times \\mathbb{Z}) = d(H) + 1$ if $d(H_{ab}) = d(H)$.\n\nWe apply this to our group $H = SL(2,5)$:\n1.  The group $SL(2,5)$ is a finite group that can be generated by 2 elements, so $d(SL(2,5)) = 2$.\n2.  The group $SL(2,5)$ is a perfect group, which means it is equal to its own commutator subgroup, $[SL(2,5), SL(2,5)] = SL(2,5)$.\n3.  The abelianization of $SL(2,5)$ is therefore the trivial group: $SL(2,5)/[SL(2,5), SL(2,5)] = \\{e\\}$.\n4.  The minimal number of generators for the trivial group is 0, so $d((SL(2,5))_{ab}) = 0$.\n\nComparing these values, we have $d(SL(2,5)) = 2$ and $d((SL(2,5))_{ab}) = 0$. Since $0 < 2$, the condition $d(H_{ab}) < d(H)$ is met. Therefore, the minimal number of generators for the direct product is equal to the minimal number of generators for the original group:\n$d(SL(2,5) \\times \\mathbb{Z}) = d(SL(2,5)) = 2$.\n\nThe minimal number of generators for the fundamental group of the double branched cover of $S^4$ over the 5-twist-spun knot of the trefoil is 2.\n\n<<<2>>>"
