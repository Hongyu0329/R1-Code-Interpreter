The initiating biochemical reaction is the non-covalent binding of a drug or its metabolite to a specific Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) protein, which alters its conformation. This drug-HLA complex is then recognized by T-cell receptors, initiating a cell-mediated cytotoxic immune response against the body's own keratinocytes.
