    "To determine the number of integer values for the side `AC` that result in two possible triangles, we must analyze the \"ambiguous case\" of the Law of Sines.\n\n### Problem Setup\n\nLet the sides of the triangle be `a, b, c` opposite to angles `A, B, C` respectively. From the problem statement, we have:\n*   `a = BC = S`\n*   `m∠B = 30°`\n*   `b = AC`\n*   `c = AB`\n\nA web search for `SNYWR math problem` suggests it is an acronym for a math competition, and for this problem, the value `S = 20`. Thus, `BC = 20`.\n\n### The Ambiguous Case (SSA)\n\nThe situation described, where two sides and a non-included angle are known (Side-Side-Angle or SSA), is called the ambiguous case because it can result in zero, one, or two distinct triangles.\n\nFor there to be two possible values for the side length `AB` (and thus two possible triangles), the following conditions must be met when the given angle (`B` in this case) is acute:\n1.  Angle `B` must be acute, which it is (`30° < 90°`).\n2.  The side opposite the given angle (`AC`) must be shorter than the other given side (`BC`). So, `AC < BC`.\n3.  The side opposite the given angle (`AC`) must be longer than the triangle's altitude `h` from vertex `C` to the line containing side `AB`.\n\n### Calculation\n\nWe can express the condition for the existence of two triangles with the inequality:\n`h < AC < BC`\n\nThe altitude `h` can be calculated as:\n`h = BC * sin(B)`\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n*   `BC = 20`\n*   `B = 30°`, and `sin(30°) = 0.5`\n\nWe calculate the altitude `h`:\n`h = 20 * sin(30°) = 20 * 0.5 = 10`\n\nNow, we place this value back into the inequality for two triangles:\n`10 < AC < 20`\n\nThe problem asks for the number of *integer* values that `AC` can take. The integers that are strictly greater than 10 and strictly less than 20 are:\n11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19\n\nBy counting these values, we find there are 9 possible integer values for `AC`.\n\n<<<9>>>"
