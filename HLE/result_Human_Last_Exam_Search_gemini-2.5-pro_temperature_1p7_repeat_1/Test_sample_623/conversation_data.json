    "Zero 13C-labeled CO2 molecules will be released during the process of glycolysis.\n\nGlycolysis is the metabolic pathway that breaks down a six-carbon glucose molecule into two three-carbon pyruvate molecules. Throughout this series of reactions, which occurs in the cytoplasm, there is no loss of carbon atoms in the form of carbon dioxide (CO2). The six carbons from the original glucose are all accounted for in the two resulting pyruvate molecules.\n\nThe release of carbon dioxide from the breakdown of glucose occurs in subsequent metabolic stages. Specifically, CO2 is first released when pyruvate is converted to acetyl-CoA in a process called pyruvate oxidation, which links glycolysis to the citric acid cycle. Further CO2 is released during the citric acid cycle itself. Since the question is strictly limited to glycolysis, no CO2 is produced.\n\nFor context on the fate of the labeled carbons *after* glycolysis:\n*   The ¹³C at the C1 position of glucose would end up on the carboxyl group of one pyruvate molecule.\n*   The ¹³C at the C4 position of glucose would end up on the methyl group of the second pyruvate molecule.\n\nDuring pyruvate oxidation, it is the carboxyl group that is cleaved off to form CO2. Therefore, if the process were to continue, one molecule of ¹³C-labeled CO2 would be released from the pyruvate that originated from carbons 1, 2, and 3 of the glucose molecule. However, during glycolysis alone, no CO2 is released.\n\n<<<0>>>"
