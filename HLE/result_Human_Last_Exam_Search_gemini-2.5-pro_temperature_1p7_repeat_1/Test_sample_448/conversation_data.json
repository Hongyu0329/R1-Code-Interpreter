    "The rarest noble gas on Earth as a percentage of all terrestrial matter in 2002 was radon.\n\nAmong the naturally occurring noble gases, radon is the rarest. Its atmospheric abundance is exceedingly low, estimated at 1x10^-19%. This is significantly lower than the atmospheric concentration of xenon, the rarest of the stable noble gases, which is about 0.0000087%.\n\nRadon is a radioactive element with its most stable isotope, radon-222, having a half-life of only 3.8 days. It is continuously produced in the Earth's crust from the radioactive decay of radium-226 but exists in only minute quantities. Due to its instability and short half-life, it is considered one of the rarest elements on Earth.\n\nWhile the synthetic element oganesson is also a noble gas, it does not occur naturally on Earth and is only produced in laboratories in extremely small, short-lived quantities. Therefore, among the noble gases found in terrestrial matter, radon is the least abundant.\n\n<<<Radon>>>"
