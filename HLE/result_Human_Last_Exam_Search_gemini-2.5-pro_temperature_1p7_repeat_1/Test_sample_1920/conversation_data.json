    "To find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters $\\chi$ of conductor $d=53599$ and order $6$, we follow these steps:\n\n**1. Factorize the conductor $d$**\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of the conductor $d = 53599$.\n$d = 7 \\times 13 \\times 19 \\times 31$.\nSince $d$ is a product of distinct primes (it is square-free), a Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $d$ can be uniquely written as a product of characters $\\chi_p$ for each prime factor $p$ of $d$:\n$\\chi = \\chi_7 \\chi_{13} \\chi_{19} \\chi_{31}$\nwhere $\\chi_p$ is a Dirichlet character modulo $p$.\n\n**2. Condition for a primitive character**\nA character $\\chi$ modulo a square-free number $d = p_1 p_2 \\cdots p_k$ is primitive if and only if each component character $\\chi_{p_i}$ is a primitive character modulo $p_i$. For a prime modulus $p$, a character is primitive if and only if it is not the principal character (the trivial character which is always 1 for inputs coprime to $p$). The principal character is the unique character of order 1. Thus, for $\\chi_p$ to be primitive, its order must be greater than 1.\n\n**3. Order of the character**\nThe order of the product character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters:\n$\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_7), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{13}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{19}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{31}))$.\nWe are given that the order of $\\chi$ must be 6. Let $k_p = \\text{ord}(\\chi_p)$. The condition is:\n$\\text{lcm}(k_7, k_{13}, k_{19}, k_{31}) = 6$.\n\n**4. Conditions on the orders of component characters**\nFrom the lcm condition, each individual order $k_p$ must be a divisor of 6. Since each $\\chi_p$ must be primitive, its order $k_p$ must be greater than 1. Therefore, the possible orders for each component character are $k_p \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$.\n\nThe group of Dirichlet characters modulo a prime $p$ is cyclic and has order $\\phi(p) = p-1$. A character of order $k$ exists if and only if $k$ divides $p-1$. The number of such characters is given by $\\phi(k)$.\n\nLet's check this condition for our primes:\n*   For $p=7$, $p-1=6$. Since $\\{2,3,6\\}$ all divide 6, characters of these orders exist.\n*   For $p=13$, $p-1=12$. Since $\\{2,3,6\\}$ all divide 12, characters of these orders exist.\n*   For $p=19$, $p-1=18$. Since $\\{2,3,6\\}$ all divide 18, characters of these orders exist.\n*   For $p=31$, $p-1=30$. Since $\\{2,3,6\\}$ all divide 30, characters of these orders exist.\n\nThe number of characters for each possible order $k$ is:\n*   Number of characters of order 2: $\\phi(2)=1$.\n*   Number of characters of order 3: $\\phi(3)=2$.\n*   Number of characters of order 6: $\\phi(6)=\\phi(2)\\phi(3)=2$.\n\n**5. Counting the number of characters**\nWe need to count the number of combinations of characters $(\\chi_7, \\chi_{13}, \\chi_{19}, \\chi_{31})$ such that $\\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_7), \\dots, \\text{ord}(\\chi_{31})) = 6$.\n\nLet's consider the set of all primitive characters whose component orders are divisors of 6 (i.e., orders from $\\{2,3,6\\}$). For each prime factor $p$ of $d$, the number of available primitive characters whose order divides 6 is $\\phi(2) + \\phi(3) + \\phi(6) = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5$. Since there are four prime factors, the total number of combinations of such characters is $5 \\times 5 \\times 5 \\times 5 = 5^4 = 625$.\n\nThis total of 625 includes characters whose order might be 2 or 3, not just 6. The lcm of the orders of the component characters can be 2, 3, or 6. Let's find the number of characters with order 2 and 3 and subtract them from the total.\n\n*   **Characters of order 2**: For the lcm of the orders to be 2, the order of each component character $k_p$ must be a divisor of 2. Since $k_p > 1$, this means $k_p$ must be 2 for all four primes. For each prime, there is $\\phi(2)=1$ character of order 2. Thus, the total number of characters of order 2 is $1 \\times 1 \\times 1 \\times 1 = 1^4 = 1$.\n\n*   **Characters of order 3**: For the lcm of the orders to be 3, the order of each component character $k_p$ must be a divisor of 3. Since $k_p > 1$, this means $k_p$ must be 3 for all four primes. For each prime, there are $\\phi(3)=2$ characters of order 3. Thus, the total number of characters of order 3 is $2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 2^4 = 16$.\n\nThe number of primitive characters of order 6 is the total number of characters with component orders dividing 6, minus those whose order is 2, and minus those whose order is 3.\n\nNumber of characters of order 6 = (Total characters with component orders in $\\{2,3,6\\}$) - (Number of characters of order 2) - (Number of characters of order 3)\nNumber = $5^4 - 1^4 - 2^4 = 625 - 1 - 16 = 608$.\n\n"
