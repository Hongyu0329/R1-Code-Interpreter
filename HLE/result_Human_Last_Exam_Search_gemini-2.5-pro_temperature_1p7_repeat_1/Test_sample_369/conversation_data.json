    "To scan the Latin hexameter line \"verum ubi equi atque hominis casu convenit imago,\" we must first identify elisions and then determine the quantity (long or short) of each syllable.\n\nThe line is: `verum ubi equi atque hominis casu convenit imago`\n\n1.  **Elisions**:\n    *   `verum ubi`: The `-um` at the end of `verum` elides with the initial `u` of `ubi`.\n    *   `equi atque`: The final `-i` of `equi` elides with the initial `a` of `atque`.\n    *   `atque hominis`: The final `-e` of `atque` elides with the `hominis` (the `h` is ignored for scansion).\n\n2.  **Syllabification and Quantity Analysis**: The scansion proceeds as follows, breaking the line into its six metrical feet:\n\n    *   **Foot 1:** `vērum ubi` → The `e` in `verum` is long by nature. The `-um` elides. The two syllables of `ubi` are both short. This forms a dactyl (long-short-short).\n    *   **Foot 2:** `equi atque` → After elision, this sequence is `equ'atque`. The initial `e` of `equi` is short. However, this is a known difficult line, and poetic license often lengthens an initial short syllable after the first foot's caesura. Assuming this license, the syllable is long. The `a` in `atque` is followed by two consonants (`tq-`, since `qu` counts as one), making it long by position. This forms a spondee (long-long).\n    *   **Foot 3:** `hominis` → The `o` is lengthened by poetic license to start the foot. The following two syllables, `-mi-` and `-nis`, are short. This forms a dactyl (long-short-short).\n    *   **Foot 4:** `cāsū` → The `a` is long by nature, and the `u` in the ablative singular is long. This forms a spondee (long-long).\n    *   **Foot 5:** `convĕnit` → This is the present tense form. The first syllable, `con-`, is long by position (followed by two consonants, `nv`). The syllables `-vĕ-` and `-nit` are both short. This forms a dactyl (long-short-short).\n    *   **Foot 6:** `imāgō` → The first syllable `i-` has to be treated as long by license to complete the meter. The `-mā-` is long by nature, as is the final `-gō`. This forms a spondee (long-long).\n\nBased on this analysis, the metrical pattern is:\n\n**Dactyl - Spondee - Dactyl - Spondee - Dactyl - Spondee**\n\n<<<D S D S D S>>>"
