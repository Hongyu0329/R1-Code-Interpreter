    "To find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $N=36036$ and order 6, we will follow these steps:\n1.  Determine the prime factorization of $N$.\n2.  Understand the structure of primitive Dirichlet characters for a composite conductor.\n3.  Determine the number of primitive characters for each prime power in the factorization, according to the constraints on the order.\n4.  Combine the results to find the total number of characters of order 6.\n\n**Step 1: Prime Factorization of N**\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of $N = 36036$.\n$N = 36 \\times 1001 = (4 \\times 9) \\times (7 \\times 11 \\times 13) = 2^2 \\times 3^2 \\times 7 \\times 11 \\times 13$.\n\n**Step 2: Structure of Primitive Dirichlet Characters**\nA Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $N$ is primitive if its conductor is exactly $N$. If $N = p_1^{a_1} p_2^{a_2} \\cdots p_r^{a_r}$ is the prime factorization of $N$, a character $\\chi$ modulo $N$ can be uniquely written as a product of characters $\\chi_i$ modulo $p_i^{a_i}$:\n$\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\cdots \\chi_r$.\n\nThe character $\\chi$ is primitive modulo $N$ if and only if each component character $\\chi_i$ is primitive modulo $p_i^{a_i}$.\nThe order of $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters:\n$\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_1), \\text{ord}(\\chi_2), \\dots, \\text{ord}(\\chi_r))$.\n\nWe need to find the number of combinations of primitive characters $\\chi_{p^a}$ such that the lcm of their orders is 6.\n\n**Step 3: Primitive Characters for Each Prime Power Factor**\nThe condition $\\text{lcm}(o_1, o_2, \\dots, o_r) = 6$ implies that for each component character $\\chi_i$, its order $o_i$ must be a divisor of 6. Let's find the number of primitive characters for each prime power factor of $N$ whose order divides 6.\n\n*   **Modulo $2^2 = 4$**: The group of characters modulo 4 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_2$. There is one primitive character, which has order 2. This order divides 6. So, there is 1 choice for $\\chi_4$.\n\n*   **Modulo $3^2 = 9$**: The group of characters modulo 9 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/9\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_6$. A character modulo 9 is primitive if its order is divisible by 3. The possible orders of elements in $C_6$ are 1, 2, 3, 6. The primitive characters are those of order 3 and 6. Both of these orders divide 6.\n    *   Number of characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n    *   Number of characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$.\n    So, there are $2+2=4$ choices for $\\chi_9$.\n\n*   **Modulo 7**: The group of characters is $C_6$. A character modulo a prime $p$ is primitive if it is not the principal character (which has order 1). The orders of primitive characters are 2, 3, and 6. All these divide 6.\n    *   Number of characters of order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$.\n    *   Number of characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n    *   Number of characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$.\n    So, there are $1+2+2=5$ choices for $\\chi_7$.\n\n*   **Modulo 11**: The group of characters is $C_{10}$. Primitive characters have orders that divide 10 and are greater than 1. We need the order to divide 6. The possible orders must divide $\\gcd(10, 6) = 2$. Thus, the only possible order is 2.\n    *   Number of characters of order 2: $\\phi(2)=1$.\n    So, there is 1 choice for $\\chi_{11}$.\n\n*   **Modulo 13**: The group of characters is $C_{12}$. Primitive characters must have an order that divides $\\gcd(12, 6) = 6$. The possible orders are 2, 3, and 6.\n    *   Number of characters of order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$.\n    *   Number of characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n    *   Number of characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$.\n    So, there are $1+2+2=5$ choices for $\\chi_{13}$.\n\n**Step 4: Combining the Results**\nWe need to count the number of combinations of these primitive characters $(\\chi_4, \\chi_9, \\chi_7, \\chi_{11}, \\chi_{13})$ such that the lcm of their orders is exactly 6.\nLet $S$ be the set of all primitive characters of conductor $N$ whose order divides 6. The number of such characters is the product of the number of choices for each component:\n$|S| = 1 \\times 4 \\times 5 \\times 1 \\times 5 = 100$.\n\nNow, we must ensure the order is exactly 6. The order is not 6 if it is a proper divisor of 6; i.e., it divides 2 or it divides 3. We use the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion.\nThe number of characters of order 6 is:\n$N_6 = |S| - |S_2 \\cup S_3| = |S| - (|S_2| + |S_3| - |S_1|)$, where $|S_k|$ is the number of characters in $S$ whose order divides $k$.\n\n*   **Order divides 2 ($|S_2|$)**: The order of $\\chi$ divides 2 if and only if the order of each component $\\chi_{p^a}$ divides 2.\n    *   For $\\chi_9$, the primitive characters have orders 3 and 6. Neither of these divides 2. Thus, there are 0 choices for $\\chi_9$.\n    *   This means $|S_2| = 1 \\times 0 \\times 1 \\times 1 \\times 1 = 0$.\n\n*   **Order divides 3 ($|S_3|$)**: The order of $\\chi$ divides 3 if and only if the order of each component $\\chi_{p^a}$ divides 3.\n    *   For $\\chi_4$, the primitive character has order 2. This does not divide 3. Thus, there are 0 choices for $\\chi_4$.\n    *   This means $|S_3| = 0 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 0 \\times 2 = 0$.\n\n*   **Order divides 1 ($|S_1|$)**: The only character of order 1 is the principal character, which is not primitive for any modulus greater than 1. So, $|S_1|=0$.\n\nSubstituting these values back into the inclusion-exclusion formula:\n$N_6 = 100 - (0 + 0 - 0) = 100$.\n\nTherefore, there are 100 primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $N=36036$ and order 6.\n\n<<<100>>>"
