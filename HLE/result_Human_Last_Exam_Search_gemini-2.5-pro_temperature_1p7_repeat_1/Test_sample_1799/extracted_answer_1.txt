It is not true that the second postulate of special relativity is superfluous and can be deduced from the first. The first postulate, the principle of relativity, when combined with assumptions of homogeneity and isotropy of spacetime, allows for a family of possible transformations between inertial frames, each characterized by a universal invariant speed. This speed could be infinite, which would correspond to Galilean relativity. To arrive at special relativity, the value of this speed must be specified. The second postulate provides this specification by stating that the invariant speed is the speed of light, a finite value. Therefore, the second postulate is an essential, independent component of the theory.
