    "The first winner of the Academy Award for Best Picture to depict a Luxor Obelisk on-screen was *An American in Paris*, which won in 1951. The film features a lavish ballet sequence set in a re-creation of the Place de la Concorde in Paris, where one of the two Luxor Obelisks has stood since 1836.\n\nThe film, starring Gene Kelly and Leslie Caron, is renowned for its extensive musical numbers that are artistically set in various Parisian landmarks. The Place de la Concorde, with its iconic fountain and central obelisk, serves as a backdrop for a key dance sequence. Models of the fountain were used in the production to plan the choreography and camera angles for the full-scale set.\n\nWhile earlier Best Picture winners, such as *The Life of Emile Zola* (1937), were set in Paris, there is no definitive evidence that they featured the Place de la Concorde or the Luxor Obelisk on-screen. The 1937 film about the French author was primarily filmed on Hollywood backlots and some location shooting in California. Although historical and fictional accounts of Emile Zola's life place him at the famous square, the film adaptation does not appear to have included it.\n\nAnother potential candidate, *Around the World in 80 Days* (1956), also features Paris as a location but lacks specific evidence of the Place de la Concorde being depicted. Later films set in ancient Egypt, like *Cleopatra* (1963), were not Best Picture winners and were largely filmed outside of Egypt, without featuring the original Luxor Temple.\n\nTherefore, with strong evidence pointing to its inclusion in a major production number, *An American in Paris* holds the distinction of being the first Best Picture laureate to showcase the famous Egyptian monument.\n\n<<<*An American in Paris* (1951)>>>"
