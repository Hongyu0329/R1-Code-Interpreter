    "The conceptual metaphor expressed by \"my love for humanity\" is a structural metaphor.\n\nIn the theory of conceptual metaphor, developed by George Lakoff and Mark Johnson, metaphors are not just a matter of language but are fundamental to thought and action. They allow us to understand one conceptual domain in terms of another. There are three main types of conceptual metaphors: orientational, ontological, and structural.\n\nOrientational metaphors organize concepts spatially, such as up/down or in/out (e.g., \"I'm feeling up\"). Ontological metaphors allow us to view abstract concepts as concrete entities or substances (e.g., treating love as a physical object). Structural metaphors, however, are more complex and involve using one well-understood concept to structure another, often abstract, one.\n\nThe expression \"my love for humanity\" falls under the category of a structural metaphor because the abstract and complex concept of 'love' is understood in terms of another concept that provides it with structure. For instance, common structural metaphors for love include LOVE IS A JOURNEY, LOVE IS WAR, or LOVE IS A PHYSICAL FORCE. These metaphors provide a framework for understanding different aspects of the emotion of love. \"My love for humanity\" would be an expression of one such underlying structural metaphor, detailing how this specific type of love is conceptualized, for example, as a bond, a guiding force, or a commitment. The sheer complexity of an emotion like \"love for humanity\" necessitates a structural metaphor to be comprehensible.\n\n<<<D>>>"
