The critical condition required to balance potentiation and depression is achieved when the heterosynaptic offset constant, $\theta$, is equal to the average rate of activation of the input populations, $\mu$. Under this condition, $\theta = \mu$, the learning rule naturally balances strengthening and weakening of synapses based on input correlations without requiring a specific critical correlation value.
