    "To solve this problem with maximum memory efficiency in C, we should avoid storing both strings in memory if possible. The comparison needs to happen character by character. We can read the first string into a buffer and then read the second string one character at a time, comparing it against the corresponding character in the stored first string. This approach minimizes the total memory required for variables.\n\n### The Most Memory-Efficient C Program\n\nThe C program below implements this memory-saving strategy. It declares a character array to store the first string, a single character variable to read the second string, and a small integer type for the loop index.\n\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <ctype.h>\n\nint main() {\n    // A buffer is needed for the first string. Its maximum length is 100,\n    // so we need 101 bytes to accommodate the null terminator ('\\0').\n    char s1[101];\n    \n    // Read the first string from standard input.\n    scanf(\"%s\", s1);\n\n    // A single character variable to hold characters from the second string as they are read.\n    char s2_char;\n\n    // The loop index 'i' only needs to count up to 100. A 'char' type, which is\n    // 1 byte, is sufficient for this range and is more memory-efficient than a 4-byte 'int'.\n    char i = 0;\n\n    // Iterate through the first string until its null terminator is reached.\n    while (s1[i] != '\\0') {\n        // The \" %c\" format specifier in scanf skips any whitespace (including the\n        // newline between inputs) and reads a single character from the second string.\n        scanf(\" %c\", &s2_char);\n\n        // Convert characters to lowercase for a case-insensitive comparison.\n        char lower1 = tolower((unsigned char)s1[i]);\n        char lower2 = tolower((unsigned char)s2_char);\n\n        // Perform the lexicographical comparison.\n        if (lower1 < lower2) {\n            printf(\"-1\\n\");\n            return 0; // Exit after finding the result.\n        }\n        if (lower1 > lower2) {\n            printf(\"1\\n\");\n            return 0; // Exit after finding the result.\n        }\n        \n        // Move to the next character.\n        i++;\n    }\n\n    // If the loop completes without finding any difference, the strings are equal.\n    // The problem guarantees the strings are of the same length.\n    printf(\"0\\n\");\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Calculation of Memory Usage (`m`)\n\nThe problem asks for the total memory in bytes (`m`) used for the variables in this program. We calculate this by summing the sizes of all declared variables. On typical competitive programming platforms (using a GCC compiler on a 64-bit system), the sizes are standard:\n\n*   **`char s1[101]`**: An array of 101 characters. The size of a `char` is defined as 1 byte.\n    *   Memory = `101 * sizeof(char)` = `101 * 1` = **101 bytes**.\n*   **`char s2_char`**: A single character variable.\n    *   Memory = `sizeof(char)` = **1 byte**.\n*   **`char i`**: A single character variable used as an index.\n    *   Memory = `sizeof(char)` = **1 byte**.\n\nThe total memory `m` is the sum of these values:\n\nm = 101 bytes + 1 byte + 1 byte = 103 bytes.\n\n<<<103>>>"
