    "In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function, denoted as \\$G_0\\$, exhibits a distinct functional dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalues, \\$\\epsilon_k\\$. This relationship becomes most apparent when transforming from the position-time representation, inherent to the path integral, to the momentum-energy (or momentum-frequency) representation.\n\nThe bare Green's function represents the propagator of a non-interacting particle. In the path integral formulation, the N-point Green's function is given by a functional integral involving the exponential of the action of the system. For a free, non-interacting particle, the action is a quadratic functional of the fields.\n\nWhile the path integral provides a powerful way to define and calculate Green's functions, its direct connection to single-particle energy eigenvalues is revealed through Fourier transformation. After performing the path integral for the two-point Green's function (the propagator) and transforming to momentum and frequency (energy) space, the bare Green's function \\$G_0(k, \\omega)\\$ for a fermionic or bosonic system takes the following form:\n\n**For fermions:**\n\n\\$G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\delta \\text{ sgn}(\\epsilon_k - \\mu)}\\$\n\nwhere:\n*   \\$\\omega\\$ is the frequency (energy).\n*   \\$\\epsilon_k\\$ is the single-particle energy eigenvalue for a state with momentum (or quantum number) \\$k\\$.\n*   \\$\\mu\\$ is the chemical potential.\n*   \\$\\delta\\$ is an infinitesimal positive quantity that ensures proper causal behavior (the \\$i\\delta\\$ prescription). The sign function, sgn, indicates whether the pole is in the upper or lower half of the complex plane, which depends on whether the state is above or below the Fermi level.\n\n**For a simple case (e.g., a free particle in a vacuum), this simplifies to:**\n\n\\$G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\delta}\\$ for \\$\\epsilon_k > \\mu\\$ (particle)\nand\n\\$G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k - i\\delta}\\$ for \\$\\epsilon_k < \\mu\\$ (hole)\n\nA more compact and frequently used expression for the bare Green's function is:\n\n\\$G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\delta}\\$\n\nHere, the poles in the complex \\$\\omega\\$-plane correspond to the excitation energies of the system. For a non-interacting system, these excitations are simply the addition or removal of a single particle with energy \\$\\epsilon_k\\$. The poles of the Green's function correspond to the spectrum of excitations.\n\nIn essence, the functional dependence of the bare Green's function on the single-particle energy eigenvalues is that of a simple pole in the complex energy (frequency) plane, where the location of the pole is determined by the eigenvalue \\$\\epsilon_k\\$. This relationship is fundamental in many-body theory and quantum field theory for describing the propagation of non-interacting particles. The path integral formalism provides the theoretical framework from which this Green's function is derived.\n\n<<<In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function \\$G_0\\$ for a single-particle state with quantum number \\$k\\$ and energy eigenvalue \\$\\epsilon_k\\$ has a functional dependence in energy (frequency) space of the form:\n\n\\$G_0(k, \\omega) \\propto \\frac{1}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k}\\$\n\nMore precisely, it is given by:\n\n\\$G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\delta}\\$\n\nwhere \\$\\omega\\$ is the frequency (energy) and \\$\\delta\\$ is an infinitesimal positive term that dictates the causal nature of the propagator. This expression shows that the bare Green's function has a simple pole at the single-particle energy eigenvalue \\$\\epsilon_k\\$.>>>"
