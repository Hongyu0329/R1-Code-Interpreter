In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function \$G_0\$ for a single-particle state with quantum number \$k\$ and energy eigenvalue \$\epsilon_k\$ has a functional dependence in energy (frequency) space of the form:

\$G_0(k, \omega) \propto \frac{1}{\omega - \epsilon_k}\$

More precisely, it is given by:

\$G_0(k, \omega) = \frac{1}{\omega - \epsilon_k + i\delta}\$

where \$\omega\$ is the frequency (energy) and \$\delta\$ is an infinitesimal positive term that dictates the causal nature of the propagator. This expression shows that the bare Green's function has a simple pole at the single-particle energy eigenvalue \$\epsilon_k\$.
