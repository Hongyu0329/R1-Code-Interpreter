    "An upper bound for the maximum norm in relation to the covolume, when considering squarefree natural numbers, is a topic primarily explored in the context of the theory of automorphic forms. Specifically, this relates to the \"sup-norm problem,\" which seeks to bound the maximum value of an automorphic form in terms of arithmetic data.\n\nBased on the provided terms, the most likely interpretation is as follows:\n*   **Squarefree natural number (N)** refers to the level of a congruence subgroup, such as $\\Gamma_0(N)$.\n*   **Covolume (V)** refers to the volume of the associated quotient space (a modular curve), for instance, $V = \\text{vol}(\\Gamma_0(N)\\backslash\\mathbb{H})$. This covolume is directly proportional to the level, with $V \\asymp N$.\n*   **Maximum norm ($k_{k,\\infty}$)** is interpreted as the sup-norm, denoted $||f||_\\infty$, of an $L^2$-normalized Hecke-Maass cuspidal newform $f$ of level $N$. The infinity norm of a function is the supremum (or maximum) of its absolute value.\n\nUnder this interpretation, the question asks for an upper bound on $||f||_\\infty$ in terms of the covolume $V$. Given the relationship $V \\asymp N$, this is equivalent to finding a bound in terms of the squarefree level $N$.\n\nA significant result in this area, which improved upon previous bounds, was established by Gergely Harcos and Nicolas Templier. They proved that for an $L^2$-normalized Heckeâ€“Maass cuspidal newform $f$ of a squarefree level $N$ with trivial character, the following upper bound holds:\n\n$||f||_\\infty \\ll_{\\lambda, \\epsilon} N^{-1/6+\\epsilon}$\n\nHere, $\\lambda$ is the Laplacian eigenvalue of the form, and $\\epsilon$ is any arbitrarily small positive number. The notation $\\ll$ indicates that the left-hand side is less than a constant multiple of the right-hand side, and the subscript shows that this constant depends on $\\lambda$ and $\\epsilon$.\n\nSince the covolume $V$ is proportional to $N$, we can express this bound in terms of $V$:\n\n$||f||_\\infty \\ll_{\\lambda, \\epsilon} V^{-1/6+\\epsilon}$\n\nThis result demonstrates that as the covolume (and thus the complexity of the underlying space) increases, the maximum value that the form can attain is bounded and, in fact, tends to decrease.\n\nThe field is an active area of research, with efforts to improve this exponent and generalize the result to other settings.\n\n<<<||f||_\\infty \\ll_{\\lambda, \\epsilon} V^{-1/6+\\epsilon}>>>"
