Let `C=100`. The maximum amount of water left `A` is given by the formula:
`A = j \cdot C - (2j-1) \left( m - C \sum_{k=j+1}^{n} \frac{1}{2k-1} \right)`
where `j` is the unique integer `j \in \{1, 2, ..., n\}` satisfying the following inequality:
`C \sum_{k=j+1}^{n} \frac{1}{2k-1} \le m < C \sum_{k=j}^{n} \frac{1}{2k-1}`
(Note: A sum where the lower limit is greater than the upper limit is taken to be 0.)
