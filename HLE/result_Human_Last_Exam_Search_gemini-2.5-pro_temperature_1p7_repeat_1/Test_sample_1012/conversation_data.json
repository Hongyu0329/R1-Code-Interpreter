    "An arbitrarily powerful quantum computer poses a significant threat to modern cryptographic systems. For symmetric key cryptography, the primary threat comes from Grover's algorithm, which can drastically speed up brute-force attacks used to guess a secret key.\n\nGrover's algorithm can search an unsorted database, or in this case, the entire space of possible keys, with a quadratic speedup compared to classical computers. This means that if a symmetric key has a length of 'n' bits, a classical computer would need, on average, 2^(n-1) attempts to find the key, while a sufficiently powerful quantum computer using Grover's algorithm would only require approximately 2^(n/2) operations. This effectively halves the security level in bits.\n\nFor example, a symmetric cipher with a 128-bit key, such as AES-128, which is currently considered very secure against classical computers, would have its effective security reduced to 64 bits against a quantum computer. An attack requiring 2^64 operations is considered feasible, making 128-bit symmetric keys insecure in a post-quantum world.\n\nTo counteract this threat, it is widely recommended to double the key length to ensure adequate security. To achieve a security level of 128 bits against a quantum attacker, which is a widely accepted benchmark for strong security, a symmetric key of 256 bits is necessary. A brute-force attack on a 256-bit key would require approximately 2^128 operations with a quantum computer, a task that is considered computationally infeasible for the foreseeable future. The U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) already requires 256-bit AES keys for data classified as Top Secret.\n\nTherefore, to be secure against an arbitrarily powerful quantum computer, a symmetric key needs to be at least 256 bits long.\n\n<<<A>>>"
