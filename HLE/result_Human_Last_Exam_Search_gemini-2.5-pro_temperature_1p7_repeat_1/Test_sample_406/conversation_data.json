    "An FGH-tripled fixed point refers to a point (x, y, z) in the Cartesian product of three sets X, Y, and Z that remains invariant under three intertwined functions F, G, and H. Specifically, given the functions:\n\n*   F: X × Y × Z → X\n*   G: Y × X × Y → Y\n*   H: Z × Y × X → Z\n\nAn element (x, y, z) ∈ X × Y × Z is called an FGH-tripled fixed point if:\n*   F(x, y, z) = x\n*   G(y, x, y) = y\n*   H(z, y, x) = z\n\nThe existence and uniqueness of such a point are guaranteed under specific conditions, which are established in the context of partially ordered complete metric spaces. This concept is a generalization of the standard tripled fixed point and an extension of the FG-coupled fixed point.\n\nThe primary conditions for the existence of an FGH-tripled fixed point are:\n\n### **1. Properties of the Spaces**\nThe sets X, Y, and Z must be partially ordered sets, and the metric spaces (X, d_X), (Y, d_Y), and (Z, d_Z) must be complete. A partial order provides a structure for comparing elements, while the completeness of the metric space ensures that sequences that are \"supposed to\" converge actually have a limit within the space.\n\n### **2. Contractive Conditions**\nThe functions F, G, and H must satisfy a generalized contractive condition. This means that for any related elements in the spaces, applying the functions brings the images closer together in terms of the metric. A common form of this condition is:\n\nd_X(F(x₁, y₁, z₁), F(x₂, y₂, z₂)) + d_Y(G(y₁, x₁, y₁), G(y₂, x₂, y₂)) + d_Z(H(z₁, y₁, x₁), H(z₂, y₂, x₂)) ≤ k [d_X(x₁, x₂) + d_Y(y₁, y₂) + d_Z(z₁, z₂)]\n\nfor all x₁, x₂ ∈ X, y₁, y₂ ∈ Y, and z₁, z₂ ∈ Z such that x₁ is comparable to x₂, y₁ is comparable to y₂, and z₁ is comparable to z₂ under their respective partial orders. The constant k must be in the range [0, 1). This is a crucial condition that ensures the mappings are contractions, a key requirement in many fixed-point theorems.\n\n### **3. Monotonicity Properties**\nThe mappings F, G, and H are required to exhibit certain monotonicity properties with respect to the partial orders on the sets X, Y, and Z. This is often referred to as a \"mixed monotone property\". For instance, F might be order-preserving in its first and third arguments and order-reversing in its second argument.\n\n### **4. Existence of an Initial Point**\nThere must exist an initial triple of points (x₀, y₀, z₀) in X × Y × Z that satisfies certain initial ordering conditions with respect to the functions F, G, and H. For example, x₀ might be \"less than or equal to\" F(x₀, y₀, z₀), and so on, under the respective partial orders. This provides a starting point for the iterative sequence used in the proof of existence.\n\n### **5. Continuity or an Equivalent Property**\nThe mappings F, G, and H are often required to be continuous. However, this condition can sometimes be relaxed to the requirement that the space has a property where if a non-decreasing sequence converges to a point, then each term of the sequence is less than or equal to that point.\n\nIn summary, the existence of an FGH-tripled fixed point is contingent on the underlying spaces being partially ordered and complete metric spaces, the functions satisfying a contractive condition and mixed monotone properties, the existence of a suitable starting point, and often, continuity of the functions.\n\n<<<The conditions for the functions F: X × Y × Z → X, G: Y × X × Y → Y, and H: Z × Y × X → Z to have an FGH-tripled fixed point are primarily established within the framework of partially ordered complete metric spaces. A point (x, y, z) is an FGH-tripled fixed point if F(x, y, z) = x, G(y, x, y) = y, and H(z, y, x) = z.\n\nThe fundamental conditions are as follows:\n1.  **Metric and Order Structure**: The spaces (X, d_X), (Y, d_Y), and (Z, d_Z) must be complete metric spaces, and (X, ≤_X), (Y, ≤_Y), and (Z, ≤_Z) must be partially ordered sets.\n2.  **Contractive Mappings**: The functions F, G, and H must collectively satisfy a contractive condition. This typically means there exists a constant k ∈ [0, 1) such that for any comparable elements (x₁, y₁, z₁) and (x₂, y₂, z₂), the sum of the distances between their images under F, G, and H is less than or equal to k times the sum of the distances between the original elements.\n3.  **Mixed Monotonicity**: The mappings F, G, and H must satisfy a mixed monotone property with respect to the partial orders on X, Y, and Z. This property dictates how the functions behave when their arguments are ordered.\n4.  **Initial Point**: There must exist an initial point (x₀, y₀, z₀) that satisfies specific order relations with its image under F, G, and H, which serves as a starting point for an iterative sequence.\n5.  **Continuity**: Often, the functions F, G, and H are required to be continuous, although this can sometimes be replaced by a weaker condition on the behavior of convergent sequences in the ordered space.An FGH-tripled fixed point refers to a point (x, y, z) in the Cartesian product of three sets X, Y, and Z that remains invariant under three intertwined functions F, G, and H.
