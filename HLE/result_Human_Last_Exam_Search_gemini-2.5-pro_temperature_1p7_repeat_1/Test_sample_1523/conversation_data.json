    "In finite-temperature field theory, the partition function Z for a neutral scalar field `ϕ` is expressed using the functional integral formalism. This involves integrating over all possible field configurations. The expression for the partition function is given by:\n\n`Z = ∫ Dϕ exp(-S_E[ϕ])`\n\nHere, `S_E[ϕ]` represents the Euclidean action of the scalar field. This formulation is achieved through the imaginary time formalism, where the time variable `t` is analytically continued to imaginary time `τ = it`.\n\nFor a neutral scalar field with mass `m`, the Euclidean action in `d` spatial dimensions is:\n\n`S_E[ϕ] = ∫₀^β dτ ∫ dᵈx [ ½(∂_τ ϕ)² + ½(∇ϕ)² + V(ϕ) ]`\n\nIn this expression:\n*   `β = 1/T` is the inverse temperature, with `T` being the temperature of the system.\n*   The integration over `τ` is performed over the compactified interval `[0, β]`.\n*   The scalar field `ϕ(x, τ)` is periodic in the imaginary time direction, satisfying `ϕ(x, 0) = ϕ(x, β)`.\n*   `V(ϕ)` is the potential energy density of the field. For a free (non-interacting) massive scalar field, this potential is `V(ϕ) = ½m²ϕ²`.\n\nThe term `(ϕ, D_ϕ)` in the functional integral representation corresponds to the part of the action that is quadratic in the field `ϕ`. By performing an integration by parts on the kinetic terms (and assuming the fields vanish at spatial infinity), we can identify the operator `D_ϕ`.\n\nThe quadratic part of the Euclidean action can be written as:\n\n`(ϕ, D_ϕ) = S_E, quadratic[ϕ] = ∫₀^β dτ ∫ dᵈx ½ ϕ(-∂_τ² - ∇² + m²)ϕ`\n\nFrom this expression, we can identify the operator `D_ϕ` as the differential operator acting on `ϕ` within the integral.\n\nTherefore, the inner product `(ϕ, D_ϕ)` for a neutral scalar field in the functional integral representation of the partition function is given by:\n\n`(ϕ, D_ϕ) = ∫₀^β dτ ∫ dᵈx ½ ϕ(x, τ) (-∂_τ² - ∇² + m²) ϕ(x, τ)`\n\nAnd the operator `D_ϕ` is:\n\n`D_ϕ = -∂_τ² - ∇² + m²`\n\nwhere `∂_τ²` is the second partial derivative with respect to the imaginary time `τ`, and `∇²` is the Laplacian operator in the spatial dimensions.\n\n<<<In finite-temperature field theory for a neutral scalar field, the inner product `(ϕ,D_ϕ)` in the functional integral representation of the partition function is the quadratic part of the Euclidean action.  It is given by `(ϕ, D_ϕ) = ∫₀^β dτ ∫ d³x ½ ϕ(x, τ) (-∂_τ² - ∇² + m²) ϕ(x, τ)`, where `β` is the inverse temperature, `τ` is the imaginary time, `∇²` is the spatial Laplacian, and `m` is the mass of the scalar field. The operator `D_ϕ` is therefore `(-∂_τ² - ∇² + m²)`.>>>"
