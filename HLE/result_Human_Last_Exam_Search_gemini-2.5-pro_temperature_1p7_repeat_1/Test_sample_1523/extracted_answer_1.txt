In finite-temperature field theory for a neutral scalar field, the inner product `(ϕ,D_ϕ)` in the functional integral representation of the partition function is the quadratic part of the Euclidean action.  It is given by `(ϕ, D_ϕ) = ∫₀^β dτ ∫ d³x ½ ϕ(x, τ) (-∂_τ² - ∇² + m²) ϕ(x, τ)`, where `β` is the inverse temperature, `τ` is the imaginary time, `∇²` is the spatial Laplacian, and `m` is the mass of the scalar field. The operator `D_ϕ` is therefore `(-∂_τ² - ∇² + m²)`.
