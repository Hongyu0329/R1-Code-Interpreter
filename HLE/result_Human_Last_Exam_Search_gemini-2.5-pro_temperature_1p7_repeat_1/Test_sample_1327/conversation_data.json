    "The pattern in the sequence 2, 11, 23, 51, 119 can be determined by observing the relationship between consecutive terms.\n\nLet's denote the terms of the sequence as x₁, x₂, x₃, x₄, and x₅.\n*   x₁ = 2\n*   x₂ = 11\n*   x₃ = 23\n*   x₄ = 51\n*   x₅ = 119\n\nThe pattern can be described by the formula: xn = 3 * xn-1 - k, where 'k' is a value that changes with each step.\n\nLet's find the value of 'k' for each term:\n*   For x₃: 23 = 3 * x₂ - k  => 23 = 3 * 11 - k => 23 = 33 - k => k = 10\n*   For x₄: 51 = 3 * x₃ - k  => 51 = 3 * 23 - k => 51 = 69 - k => k = 18\n*   For x₅: 119 = 3 * x₄ - k => 119 = 3 * 51 - k => 119 = 153 - k => k = 34\n\nNow, let's examine the sequence of the subtracted numbers: 10, 18, 34. We can see a pattern in the differences between these numbers:\n*   18 - 10 = 8\n*   34 - 18 = 16\n\nThe difference is doubling each time (8, 16, ...), which follows a geometric progression with a common ratio of 2. The next difference will be 16 * 2 = 32.\n\nTherefore, the next number to be subtracted will be 34 + 32 = 66.\n\nFinally, we can calculate the next term in the original sequence (x₆):\n*   x₆ = 3 * x₅ - 66\n*   x₆ = 3 * 119 - 66\n*   x₆ = 357 - 66\n*   x₆ = 291\n\nSo, the number that should be filled in the parentheses is 291.\n\n<<<A>>>"
