    "The largest French ship by displacement to be sunk by a U-boat before the 1940 armistice was the submarine **Doris**.\n\nThe armistice between France and Germany was signed on June 22, 1940, and took effect on June 25, 1940. In the period of the war preceding this, from September 1939, only one French warship is recorded as having been sunk by a German U-boat.\n\nThe submarine *Doris*, with a submerged displacement of 765 tons, was sunk by the German submarine U-9 on May 8, 1940, off the Dutch coast. At the time, the *Doris* was operating under British command. No other French warship of a larger displacement has been identified as lost to a U-boat during this specific timeframe.\n\n<<<Doris>>>"
