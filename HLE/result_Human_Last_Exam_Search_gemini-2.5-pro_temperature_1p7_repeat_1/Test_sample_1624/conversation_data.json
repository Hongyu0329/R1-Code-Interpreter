    "Yes, there is an upper bound on the cardinality of X, which is the cardinality of the continuum, c = |ℝ|.\n\nHere is the reasoning:\n1.  The dense open subset *U* is a 1-dimensional topological manifold because each of its points has a neighborhood homeomorphic to ℝ.\n2.  Since *U* is a subset of the metric space *X*, *U* itself is a metric space. Any manifold that is a metric space is locally separable. A locally separable metric space is separable. Therefore, *U* is a separable space.\n3.  This means *U* contains a countable dense subset, let's call it *D*.\n4.  Because *D* is dense in *U* and *U* is dense in *X*, it follows that *D* is dense in *X*. Therefore, *X* is a separable metric space.\n5.  A key theorem in topology states that every separable metric space has a cardinality no greater than that of the continuum (c, the cardinality of the real numbers). This can be shown by constructing an injective (one-to-one) map from the space *X* into the set of real-valued functions on the countable dense set *D*, which has cardinality c.\n\nSince *X* must be a separable metric space, its cardinality is at most *c*.\n\n<<<The cardinality of the continuum, c.>>>"
