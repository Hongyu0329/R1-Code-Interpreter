    "### Wilson-Fisher Fixed Point Coupling in ϕ⁴ Theory\n\nIn the ϕ⁴ theory near four dimensions, the leading order expression for the non-trivial fixed point coupling, denoted as u*, is given by the Wilson-Fisher fixed point. This fixed point is calculated using the epsilon expansion, where ϵ = 4 - d, and d is the number of spatial dimensions.\n\nThe beta function, which describes the running of the coupling constant with the energy scale, is calculated perturbatively in the coupling u and in ϵ. The fixed points of the renormalization group flow are found by setting the beta function to zero, β(u*) = 0.\n\nTo the leading order in ϵ, the Wilson-Fisher fixed point for the coupling u is found to be:\n\n**u* = (2/3)ϵ**\n\nThis result is a cornerstone of the modern understanding of critical phenomena, providing a way to calculate critical exponents as an expansion in ϵ. For instance, the two-loop beta function gives the fixed point to the next order in ϵ as u* = (2/3)ϵ + (34/9)ϵ² + O(ϵ³).\n\nThe existence of this non-trivial fixed point below four dimensions (ϵ > 0) is crucial for describing the universal scaling behavior observed in a wide range of physical systems near a critical point, such as the liquid-gas critical point and the Curie point of a ferromagnet. The theory at this fixed point is a conformal field theory.\n\n<<<u* = (2/3)ϵ>>>"
