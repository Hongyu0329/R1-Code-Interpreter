    "If two people successfully placed the maximum possible number of non-attacking bishops on the edge squares of a chessboard, 14 squares would remain without a bishop.\n\nA standard 8x8 chessboard has 28 edge squares. The challenge lies in placing as many bishops as possible on these squares so that no two bishops threaten each other. Since bishops move along diagonals, no two bishops of the same color can be on the same diagonal line.\n\nThe maximum number of non-attacking bishops that can be placed on a standard 8x8 board is 14. This is achieved by placing all the bishops along the edge of the board. Specifically, one common solution involves placing seven bishops on the squares of one color in the first row and seven bishops on the squares of the same color in the eighth row, although this arrangement does not use only edge squares. A valid placement that strictly uses edge squares involves placing bishops on all squares of the first rank (row). For a standard 8x8 board, this would mean placing bishops on all 8 squares of the first row and all 6 remaining squares of the last row (excluding the corners already used), for a total of 14 bishops. These can be arranged to be non-attacking.\n\nGiven this, the calculation is as follows:\n*   Total number of edge squares: 28\n*   Maximum number of non-attacking bishops on edge squares: 14\n*   Edge squares without bishops: 28 - 14 = 14\n\nThus, 14 edge squares would be left empty.\n\n<<<14>>>"
