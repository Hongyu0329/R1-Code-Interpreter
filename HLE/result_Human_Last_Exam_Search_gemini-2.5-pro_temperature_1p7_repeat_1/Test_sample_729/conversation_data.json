    "In the generalized quaternion group of size 128, denoted as Q_128, there are 7 power subgroups.\n\nA power subgroup of a group G is a subgroup of the form G^n, which is generated by the n-th powers of all elements in G. For the generalized quaternion group Q_128, we need to determine the number of distinct subgroups obtained by this process.\n\nThe generalized quaternion group Q_128 can be defined by the presentation:\nQ_128 = < x, y | x^64 = 1, x^32 = y^2, yxy^(-1) = x^(-1) >\n\nThe elements of Q_128 are of two types:\n1.  Powers of x, which form a cyclic subgroup <x> of order 64.\n2.  Elements of the form x^i*y for i from 0 to 63. These elements have an order of 4, as (x^i*y)^2 = x^32 and (x^i*y)^4 = (x^32)^2 = x^64 = 1.\n\nThe set of orders of all elements in Q_128 is {1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64}. The exponent of the group, which is the least common multiple of the orders of all elements, is 64. This means that for any integer n, the power subgroup G^n is equal to G^gcd(n, 64). Therefore, we only need to consider the power subgroups G^d where d is a divisor of 64.\n\nThe divisors of 64 are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64. Let's examine the subgroup generated for each of these divisors:\n*   **G^1:** This is the entire group Q_128.\n*   **G^2:** This subgroup is generated by the squares of all elements. The squares are of the form (x^i)^2 = x^(2i) and (x^i*y)^2 = x^32. The subgroup generated by these elements is <x^2>, a cyclic group of order 32.\n*   **G^4:** This is generated by the fourth powers of all elements. (x^i)^4 = x^(4i) and (x^i*y)^4 = 1. Thus, G^4 = <x^4>, a cyclic group of order 16.\n*   **G^8:** Following the same pattern, G^8 = <x^8>, a cyclic group of order 8.\n*   **G^16:** G^16 = <x^16>, a cyclic group of order 4.\n*   **G^32:** G^32 = <x^32>, the unique subgroup of order 2.\n*   **G^64:** G^64 = <x^64> = {1}, the trivial subgroup.\n\nIf we take any integer n that is not a power of 2, let n = m * 2^k where m is an odd number. It can be shown that the power subgroup G^n will be identical to G^(2^k). For example, if n is an odd number (k=0), G^n will be equal to G^1 = Q_128. If n=6, which is 3 * 2^1, then G^6 is the same as G^2.\n\nTherefore, the distinct power subgroups are the ones corresponding to the powers of 2 that divide 64. Counting these distinct subgroups, we have:\n1.  Q_128\n2.  <x^2> (Order 32)\n3.  <x^4> (Order 16)\n4.  <x^8> (Order 8)\n5.  <x^16> (Order 4)\n6.  <x^32> (Order 2)\n7.  {1} (The trivial subgroup)\n\nThese seven subgroups are all distinct.\n\n<<<7>>>"
