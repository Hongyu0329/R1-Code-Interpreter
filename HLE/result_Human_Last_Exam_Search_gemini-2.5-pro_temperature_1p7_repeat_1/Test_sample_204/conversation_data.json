    "The Hopf charge, or Hopf invariant, of a vector field is a topological invariant that describes how the field is \"twisted\" in three-dimensional space. While the Whitehead formula provides a way to calculate this as an integral, the Hopf charge can often be determined more directly by analyzing the topological structure of the field. A common method is to find the linking number of the preimages of two distinct points on the target sphere.\n\nThe given vector field is defined as:\n*   nx = sin(G)cos(f)\n*   ny = sin(G)sin(f)\n*   nz = cos(G)\n\nwhere `f = atan2(y,x)` is the azimuthal angle in the xy-plane, and `G = π * exp(-10*r2)` with `r2 = sqrt((x*x+y*y-0.5)²+z²)`. This vector `(nx, ny, nz)` is a unit vector, meaning it maps any point in 3D space to a point on the surface of a unit sphere (S²).\n\nThe structure of this field is that of a toroidal hopfion. The Hopf charge for such structures is an integer that can be understood as the product of a poloidal winding number and a toroidal (azimuthal) winding number.\n\n1.  **Toroidal Winding Number:** The terms `cos(f)` and `sin(f)` indicate that as one circles the z-axis, the vector field also circles the equator of the target sphere once. This corresponds to a toroidal winding number of 1.\n\n2.  **Poloidal Winding Number:** The function `G` controls the angle from the \"north pole\" of the target sphere. At infinity, `r2` approaches infinity, causing `G` to approach 0. In this case, the vector `(nx,ny,nz)` points to `(0,0,1)`, the north pole. The field is configured around a circle defined by `x² + y² = 0.5` and `z=0`. Along this circle, `r2=0`, which makes `G = π`. Here, the vector points to `(0,0,-1)`, the south pole. This full range of the angle `G` from 0 to π as we move through space corresponds to a poloidal winding number of 1.\n\nSince both the toroidal and poloidal winding numbers are 1, the total Hopf charge is their product, which is 1.\n\nThis can also be confirmed by calculating the linking number of the preimages of two points. The preimage of the south pole `(0,0,-1)` is the circle `x²+y²=0.5, z=0`. The preimage of any point on the equator of the target sphere is another closed loop that passes through the disk bounded by the first circle. These two loops are linked exactly once, confirming that the Hopf charge is 1.\n\n<<<1>>>"
