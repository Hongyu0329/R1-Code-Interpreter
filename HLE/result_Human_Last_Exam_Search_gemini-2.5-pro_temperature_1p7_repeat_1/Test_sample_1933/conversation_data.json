    "The VC dimension of the first-order logic fragment $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$ with a schema $S$ containing 4 unary predicates is 4.\n\n### Analysis of the Logic\n\nThe logic $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$ allows for formulas built from four unary predicates, which we can denote as $P_1(x), P_2(x), P_3(x),$ and $P_4(x)$. The allowed logical constructs are existential quantification ($\\exists$), conjunction ($\\land$), and the constants for true ($\\top$) and false ($\\bot$).\n\nA formula in this logic with one free variable, say $x$, defines a \"concept\" or a classifier. Such a formula determines a subset of the domain for which the formula is true. Let's analyze the structure of these formulas. A typical formula might look like $\\exists y_1, ..., y_n (\\psi(x, y_1, ..., y_n))$, where $\\psi$ is a conjunction of atomic predicates. Since the predicates are unary, any atom is of the form $P_i(z)$, where $z$ is one of the variables.\n\nAny such formula can be simplified. For example, a formula like $P_1(x) \\land \\exists y (P_2(y))$ consists of a part depending on $x$ and a sentence $\\exists y (P_2(y))$ that is independent of $x$. In any given model (a universe with interpretations for the predicates), this sentence is either true or false.\n*   If $\\exists y (P_2(y))$ is true, the formula is equivalent to $P_1(x)$.\n*   If it is false, the formula is equivalent to $\\bot$ (false).\n\nConsequently, any formula in this logic with one free variable $x$ is equivalent in any given model to a formula from the set of pure conjunctions of atomic predicates involving $x$, or to $\\bot$. The set of these defining formulas, which act as our hypothesis set ($H$), are the $2^4 = 16$ possible conjunctions of the form $\\bigwedge_{i \\in I} P_i(x)$ for every subset of indices $I \\subseteq \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$. This includes the empty conjunction ($I = \\emptyset$), which is equivalent to $\\top$ (true for all elements).\n\n### Calculating the VC Dimension\n\nThe Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) dimension is the maximum size of a set of points that can be \"shattered\" by a concept class. A set is shattered if for every one of its subsets, there exists a concept in the class that selects exactly that subset.\n\n#### Lower Bound (VC-dim ≥ 4)\n\nTo show that the VC dimension is at least 4, we must demonstrate that there exists a model and a set of 4 points that can be shattered.\nLet the set of points be $X = \\{x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4\\}$. We define the interpretations of our 4 predicates on this set. Let the interpretation of predicate $P_i$ (a set $S_i$) be defined as follows:\n$S_i = X \\setminus \\{x_i\\} = \\{x_j \\mid j \\neq i\\}$\nThis means:\n*   $S_1 = \\{x_2, x_3, x_4\\}$\n*   $S_2 = \\{x_1, x_3, x_4\\}$\n*   $S_3 = \\{x_1, x_2, x_4\\}$\n*   $S_4 = \\{x_1, x_2, x_3\\}$\n\nTo shatter $X$, we must be able to form any subset $Y \\subseteq X$ by using an intersection of the sets $S_i$. Let $Y$ be an arbitrary target subset of $X$. Consider the formula formed by the conjunction of predicates corresponding to the points *not* in $Y$. Let $I_Y = \\{i \\mid x_i \\notin Y\\}$. The corresponding concept is the set $C_Y = \\bigcap_{i \\in I_Y} S_i$. An element $x_j$ belongs to $C_Y$ if and only if $x_j \\in S_i$ for all $i \\in I_Y$. By our definition of $S_i$, this means $j \\neq i$ for all $i \\in I_Y$. This is equivalent to stating that $j$ is not an index of a point outside $Y$, which means $x_j$ must be in $Y$. Thus, $C_Y = Y$.\nSince this construction works for any subset $Y \\subseteq X$, the set $X$ is shattered. This proves that the VC dimension is at least 4.\n\n#### Upper Bound (VC-dim ≤ 4)\n\nTo show the VC dimension is at most 4, we can use a property of finite concept classes. As established, our logic can express at most 16 distinct concepts (one for each subset of predicates in the conjunction). A concept class with a finite number of hypotheses, $|H|$, can shatter a set of size at most $\\log_2(|H|)$.\n\nIn our case, the number of distinct concepts, $|H|$, is $2^4 = 16$. Therefore, the VC dimension is bounded by:\nVC-dim $\\le \\log_2(16) = 4$.\n\nAlternatively, to shatter a set of $d$ points, we need to be able to generate all $2^d$ of its subsets. For a set of 5 points, we would need to generate $2^5 = 32$ subsets. Since our logic can only define at most 16 distinct subsets in any given model, it is impossible to shatter a set of 5 points. Therefore, the VC dimension cannot be 5 or greater.\n\nSince the VC dimension is at least 4 and at most 4, it must be exactly 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
