    "Without the influence of the Norse language, the Modern English word for \"sister\" would likely be \"swester\" or \"suster\". This conclusion is based on the linguistic evolution of the original Old English word \"sweostor\".\n\n### The Old English Original and Norse Influence\n\nThe native Old English term for a female sibling was *sweostor* (also spelled *swuster* or *soester* in different dialects). The contemporary word \"sister\" entered the language in the mid-13th century, influenced by the Old Norse word *systir*. This Old Norse term has the same meaning and originates from the same Proto-Germanic root, **swestÄ“r*. The a vowel change in the modern \"sister\" is a direct result of this Norse influence.\n\n### Predicting the Linguistic Path\n\nTo understand how *sweostor* might have evolved naturally, we can examine the development of other Old English words. The \"eo\" diphthong in Old English, for example, underwent several changes. In some cases, it became \"e\", as seen in the transformation of *heorte* to \"heart\" and *feond* to \"fiend\".\n\nAnother clue can be found in the related German and Dutch words, which were not influenced by Old Norse in the same way. The German for \"sister\" is *Schwester* and the Dutch is *zuster*, both of which retain a form closer to the original Germanic root.\n\nBased on these linguistic patterns, had Old English developed without the introduction of *systir* from the Norse invaders, the \"eo\" in *sweostor* would likely have simplified, leading to a modern form such as \"swester\" or \"suster\". The Middle English period did see the use of \"suster\" before \"sister\" became dominant. For example, the related Old English word *sweostorsunu*, meaning \"sister's son\", evolved into the Middle English \"sustersone\" and eventually the Modern English \"sisterson\". This demonstrates the natural phonetic shift that \"sweostor\" would have probably undergone.\n\nTherefore, in an alternate linguistic timeline without Norse contact, English speakers would likely refer to their female siblings as \"swester\" or \"suster\".\n\n<<<swester or suster>>>"
