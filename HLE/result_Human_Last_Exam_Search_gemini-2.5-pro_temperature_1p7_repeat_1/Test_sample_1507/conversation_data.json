    "The minimal number of triangles required to triangulate the outer hull of the great icosahedron corresponds to the number of faces on its convex hull. The great icosahedron is a non-convex polyhedron with 20 intersecting triangular faces. Its vertices, however, are arranged in the same way as those of a regular icosahedron.\n\nThe convex hull of the great icosahedron is a regular icosahedron. A regular icosahedron is a Platonic solid with 20 faces, each of which is an equilateral triangle. Since the faces of the convex hull are already triangles, no further subdivision is necessary for triangulation. Therefore, the outer hull is composed of these 20 triangular faces.\n\n<<<20>>>"
