    "### Under Thermal Conditions, the Electrocyclization of (2Z,4Z,6Z,8E)-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene is Highly Stereoselective, Predominantly Yielding the *cis*-Isomer.\n\nBased on the principles of Frontier Molecular Orbital (FMO) theory, the thermal electrocyclic reaction of \\((2Z,4Z,6Z,8E)\\)-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene is predicted to produce a significant majority of the *cis*-7,8-dimethylcycloocta-1,3,5-triene (Isomer A) over the *trans*-isomer (Isomer B). The reaction's high stereoselectivity arises from the steric interactions in the transition state of the ring-closing process.\n\nThe electrocyclization of deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene is a pericyclic reaction involving 8 π-electrons. According to the Woodward-Hoffmann rules, a system with 4n π-electrons (where n=2) undergoes a conrotatory ring closure under thermal conditions. In a conrotatory process, the terminal orbitals rotate in the same direction (both clockwise or both counter-clockwise) to form the new sigma bond.\n\nTo predict the stereochemical outcome, we must analyze the Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO) of the starting tetraene. For an 8π system in its ground electronic state (thermal conditions), the HOMO is ψ₄. In this orbital, the lobes at the two ends of the conjugated system have opposite phases on the same side of the molecule. To achieve the constructive overlap required for bond formation, a conrotatory motion is necessary.\n\nThe stereochemistry of the final product depends on the initial geometry of the reactant, \\((2Z,4Z,6Z,8E)\\)-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene, and the two possible conrotatory pathways:\n\n1.  **Conrotatory Clockwise Rotation:** When both terminal carbons rotate in a clockwise manner, the inward-pointing methyl group on the (8E) end and the outward-pointing methyl group on the (2Z) end both rotate upwards, leading to the formation of *cis*-7,8-dimethylcycloocta-1,3,5-triene. In the transition state for this rotation, the steric interaction is between a methyl group and a hydrogen atom.\n\n2.  **Conrotatory Counter-Clockwise Rotation:** When both terminal carbons rotate in a counter-clockwise direction, the methyl groups are forced to rotate towards each other. This would lead to a severe steric clash between the two bulky methyl groups in the transition state. This high-energy transition state makes the formation of the *trans*-isomer highly unfavorable.\n\nDue to the significant difference in steric hindrance between the two possible conrotatory transition states, the pathway leading to the *cis*-isomer is strongly favored. One authoritative source confirms that the reaction is indeed stereospecific, forming *cis*-7,8-dimethylcycloocta-1,3,5-triene as the only observed product. Therefore, the ratio of isomer A (*cis*) to isomer B (*trans*) is expected to be very high, with the *cis*-isomer being the overwhelmingly major product.\n\n<<<A is the major product, B is the minor product. The ratio of A:B is very high (A >> B)."
