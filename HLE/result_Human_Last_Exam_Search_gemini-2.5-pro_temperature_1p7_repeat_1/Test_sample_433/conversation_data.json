    "### Opened Single-Dose Ampules Must Be Used Immediately\n\nOnce a single-dose ampule is punctured in a sterile environment, it should not be stored for any period of time and must be used immediately. This guidance is based on standards from the United States Pharmacopeia (USP).\n\nAn ampule is a sealed glass container, and once broken open, it cannot be resealed, exposing the contents to potential microbial contamination. Therefore, any unused portion of the medication from a single-dose ampule must be discarded immediately after drawing up the required dose.\n\nIt is important to distinguish between single-dose ampules and single-dose vials. While single-dose vials, after being punctured, may be used for up to 12 hours if handled in a clean air environment (ISO Class 5 or better), these guidelines do not apply to ampules. If a single-dose vial is punctured in an environment with lower air quality, it must be discarded after one hour. However, for ampules, the guidance is unequivocal: they are for immediate use only, and any remaining contents should be discarded.\n\n<<<Immediately, with no storage time permitted.>>>"
