    "In the dwarf cuttlefish (*Sepia bandensis*), the brain regions that lie adjacent and posterior to the palliovisceral lobe are the **posterior chromatophore lobes**, the **fin lobes**, the **vasomotor lobes**, and the **posterior magnocellular lobes**. These structures are all located in the posterior subesophageal mass, a major division of the cuttlefish brain.\n\nThe palliovisceral lobe is a key component of the palliovisceral lobe complex, which is situated in the subesophageal mass. This lobe, along with its neighboring structures, plays a crucial role in controlling various motor functions related to the posterior part of the cuttlefish's body.\n\nResearch based on a detailed 3D brain atlas of the dwarf cuttlefish reveals the specific arrangement of these lobes. The palliovisceral lobe is involved in escape responses and the release of ink. Located in the same posterior region are the posterior chromatophore lobes, which control the chromatophores in the mantle for camouflage and communication, and the fin lobes, which control the movement of the fins. The vasomotor lobes and posterior magnocellular lobes are also identified as being part of this posterior cluster of brain regions. An interactive 3D model of the dwarf cuttlefish brain, known as Cuttlebase, visually confirms the close, posterior positioning of these lobes relative to the palliovisceral lobe.\n\n<<<In the dwarf cuttlefish, the brain regions that are adjacently posterior to the palliovisceral lobe are the posterior chromatophore lobes, the fin lobes, the vasomotor lobes, and the posterior magnocellular lobes.>>>"
