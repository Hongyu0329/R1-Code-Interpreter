**Equilibrium Mean Energy (E):**
The equilibrium mean energy for the Bose case of light quanta (photon gas) in a volume V at temperature T is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:
`E = (8π^5V / (15h^3c^3)) * (kT)^4`
where:
*   `V` is the volume.
*   `k` is the Boltzmann constant.
*   `h` is the Planck constant.
*   `c` is the speed of light.
*   `T` is the absolute temperature.

**Equilibrium Entropy (S):**
The equilibrium entropy for the photon gas is:
`S = (32π^5V k^4 / (45h^3c^3)) * T^3`
This can also be expressed in terms of the mean energy as `S = (4/3) * (E/T)`.
