    "Using the principles of large deviation theory, specifically the Boltzmann-Sanov theorem, the equilibrium state of a system is the one that minimizes the large deviation rate function. In statistical mechanics, this corresponds to the macroscopic state with the highest probability, which is the state of maximum entropy. For a gas of light quanta (photons), which are bosons governed by Bose-Einstein statistics, we can find the equilibrium values by maximizing the entropy for this system.\n\nPhotons are particles with integer spin, and their statistical behavior is described by Bose-Einstein statistics. A key characteristic of photons is that their total number is not conserved, which implies that their chemical potential (µ) is zero.\n\nThe entropy (S) for a system of bosons distributed among various energy states is given by the Boltzmann formula, S = k ln(W), where W is the number of microstates. For a Bose-Einstein gas, this leads to an entropy expression that, when maximized under the constraint of a fixed total energy, yields the Bose-Einstein distribution for the average occupation number (`n_i`) of an energy state `ε_i`. The resulting distribution is:\n`n_i = 1 / (exp(β(ε_i - µ)) - 1)`\nwhere `β = 1/(kT)`, `k` is the Boltzmann constant, and `T` is the temperature.\n\nFor light quanta, since the chemical potential µ is zero, the equilibrium distribution, also known as the Planck distribution, becomes:\n`n(ε) = 1 / (exp(βε) - 1)`\n\nTo find the equilibrium values of mean energy and entropy, we consider the photons to be in a three-dimensional cavity of volume V. The continuous density of states `g(ε)` for photons, including two polarization states, is given by:\n`g(ε)dε = (8πV / (h^3c^3)) * ε^2 dε`\nwhere `h` is Planck's constant and `c` is the speed of light.\n\n### Equilibrium Mean Energy\n\nThe mean energy (E) of the system is the sum of the energies of all photons, which can be calculated by integrating the energy of each state multiplied by its occupation number and the density of states over all possible energies.\n\n`E = ∫_0^∞ ε * n(ε) * g(ε) dε = ∫_0^∞ ε * (1 / (exp(βε) - 1)) * (8πV / (h^3c^3)) * ε^2 dε`\n`E = (8πV / (h^3c^3)) * ∫_0^∞ ε^3 / (exp(βε) - 1) dε`\n\nBy performing a substitution `x = βε`, the integral becomes a standard form related to the Riemann zeta function, evaluating to `π^4 / 15`. This yields the mean energy:\n\n`E = (8π^5V / (15h^3c^3)) * (kT)^4`\n\nThis result is the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which states that the total energy radiated per unit surface area of a black body is directly proportional to the fourth power of the black body's thermodynamic temperature. This is the equilibrium mean energy for a gas of photons.\n\n### Equilibrium Entropy\n\nThe entropy (S) of the photon gas can be found using the thermodynamic relation `E - TS = Ω`, where `Ω` is the grand potential. For a system with zero chemical potential, `Ω = -PV`. The grand potential can be calculated from the grand canonical partition function `Z`, where `Ω = -kT ln(Z)`. For a photon gas, the calculation shows that `Ω = -E/3`.\n\nSubstituting this into the thermodynamic relation:\n`E - TS = -E/3`\n`TS = 4/3 * E`\n`S = (4/3) * (E/T)`\n\nBy substituting the expression for the equilibrium mean energy `E`, we find the equilibrium entropy:\n\n`S = (4/3) * (1/T) * (8π^5V / (15h^3c^3)) * (kT)^4`\n`S = (32π^5V k^4 / (45h^3c^3)) * T^3`\n\nThus, the equilibrium entropy of a photon gas is proportional to the cube of the temperature.\n\n<<<\n**Equilibrium Mean Energy (E):**\nThe equilibrium mean energy for the Bose case of light quanta (photon gas) in a volume V at temperature T is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\n`E = (8π^5V / (15h^3c^3)) * (kT)^4`\nwhere:\n*   `V` is the volume.\n*   `k` is the Boltzmann constant.\n*   `h` is the Planck constant.\n*   `c` is the speed of light.\n*   `T` is the absolute temperature.\n\n**Equilibrium Entropy (S):**\nThe equilibrium entropy for the photon gas is:\n`S = (32π^5V k^4 / (45h^3c^3)) * T^3`\nThis can also be expressed in terms of the mean energy as `S = (4/3) * (E/T)`.\n>>>"
