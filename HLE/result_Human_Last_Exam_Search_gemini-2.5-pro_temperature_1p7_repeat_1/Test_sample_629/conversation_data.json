    "The minimal grid number, also known as the arc index, for a trefoil knot is 5. This can be determined because the trefoil is an alternating knot with a minimal crossing number of 3, and for alternating knots, the arc index is the crossing number plus two (3 + 2 = 5). This is also directly stated in sources discussing grid diagrams of the trefoil knot.\n\nResearch on the classification of knot configurations on grids has enumerated the number of diagrams for various knots. For a grid number of 5, there are a total of 10 distinct grid diagrams that represent a trefoil knot. The trefoil knot is a chiral knot, meaning it is not equivalent to its mirror image; these two forms are known as the right-hand and left-hand trefoil.\n\nDue to the symmetry of the grid and the mirroring operation (which corresponds to reflecting the grid across a diagonal), the 10 minimal diagrams are split evenly between the two chiral forms. This means there are 5 minimal grid diagrams for the right-hand trefoil and 5 for the left-hand trefoil. These counts in mathematical literature are given up to the standard equivalences of translation and rotation. Therefore, there are 5 unique minimal grid diagrams for the left-hand trefoil knot.\n\n<<<E>>>"
