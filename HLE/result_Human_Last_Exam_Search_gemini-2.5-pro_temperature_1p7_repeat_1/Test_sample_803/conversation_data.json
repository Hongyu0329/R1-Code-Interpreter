    "### Nonabelian Filled Groups of Order 2q<sup>m</sup> Identified as Dihedral Groups D<sub>6</sub> and D<sub>10</sub>\n\nThe nonabelian filled groups of order 2q<sup>m</sup>, where q is an odd prime and m is a natural number, are the dihedral groups D<sub>6</sub> and D<sub>10</sub>. This classification arises from research on the structure of \"filled groups,\" a concept in finite group theory.\n\nA finite group G is defined as \"filled\" if every maximal by inclusion product-free set within G also \"fills\" G. A set S is product-free if for any elements x and y in S, their product xy is not in S. A maximal by inclusion product-free set is one that cannot be extended by adding any other element from the group without violating the product-free property. Such a set \"fills\" the group if every non-identity element of the group is either in the set or can be written as the product of two of its elements. This concept was first introduced by Street and Whitehead, who also classified all abelian filled groups.\n\nSubsequent research has extended this classification to various nonabelian groups. A key result in this area is the classification of all filled groups of order p<sup>n</sup>q<sup>m</sup>, for any primes p and q and natural numbers n and m, by Chimere S. Anabanti. This work on filled soluble groups provides a direct answer to the question.\n\nAccording to this classification, any finite filled group of order p<sup>n</sup>q<sup>m</sup> must be either an elementary abelian 2-group or one of a short list of specific groups. For the specific case of nonabelian groups with order 2q<sup>m</sup>, the only possibilities are D<sub>6</sub> (with order 2 * 3, so q=3, m=1) and D<sub>10</sub> (with order 2 * 5, so q=5, m=1).\n\nThe dihedral group D<sub>2n</sub> represents the symmetries of a regular n-gon and has an order of 2n. For n â‰¥ 3, these groups are nonabelian. The groups D<sub>6</sub> and D<sub>10</sub> are the symmetry groups of the equilateral triangle and the regular pentagon, respectively. The study of which dihedral groups are filled has been a subject of further research, building on the initial work of Street and Whitehead. It has been established that the only filled dihedral groups are D<sub>6</sub>, D<sub>8</sub>, D<sub>10</sub>, D<sub>12</sub>, D<sub>14</sub>, and D<sub>22</sub>. This is consistent with the finding that D<sub>6</sub> and D<sub>10</sub> are the only such groups with an order of the form 2q<sup>m</sup> where q is an odd prime.\n\n<<<The nonabelian filled groups of order 2q^m for an odd prime q and a natural number m are the dihedral groups D_6 and D_10.>>>"
