The value of the critical exponent ν within a G₄ (or φ⁴) theoretical framework is not a single precise value but is dependent on the spatial dimension (d) and the number of components of the order parameter (N). For d ≥ 4, ν = 0.5 (mean-field value). For d=3, ν ≈ 0.630 for the Ising universality class (N=1). For d=2, ν = 1 for the Ising universality class.
