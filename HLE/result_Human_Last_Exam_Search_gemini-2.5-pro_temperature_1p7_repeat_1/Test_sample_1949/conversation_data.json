    "### The Three Longest Rivers Mentioned in Virgil's Aeneid\n\nThe epic Roman poem, the Aeneid, makes reference to numerous bodies of water, both real and mythological. Among the terrestrial rivers mentioned, three stand out for their significant length: the Po, the Hebrus, and the Tiber. These rivers are woven into the narrative, grounding the epic journey of Aeneas in the geographical landscape of the ancient world.\n\nThe longest river mentioned in the Aeneid is the **Po River**, known to the Romans as the *Padus*. It is the longest river in Italy, flowing for approximately 652 kilometers (405 miles) from the Cottian Alps to the Adriatic Sea. The Po is mentioned in the Aeneid in the context of the geography of Italy.\n\nThe second longest is the **Hebrus River**, now known as the Maritsa. This river flows for about 480 kilometers (300 miles) through the Balkans. Its ancient name, Hebrus, is used in the Aeneid.\n\nThe third in this list is the **Tiber River**, the famous river that flows through Rome. The Tiber, with a length of around 406 kilometers (252 miles), is the third-longest river in Italy. It plays a crucial role in the latter half of the Aeneid, as it is on its banks that Aeneas and the Trojans finally establish their new home.\n\nOther real-world rivers are also mentioned in the epic, such as the Aufidus (modern Ofanto, 170 km), the Eurotas (82 km), the Sarnus (modern Sarno, 24 km), and the Timavus (2 km surface length), but these are all considerably shorter than the Po, Hebrus, and Tiber. The Aeneid also famously features the mythological rivers of the underworld—Styx, Acheron, Cocytus, Lethe, and Phlegethon—though their lengths are not quantifiable.\n\n<<<The three longest rivers mentioned in the Aeneid are the Po (Padus), the Hebrus (Maritsa), and the Tiber.>>>"
