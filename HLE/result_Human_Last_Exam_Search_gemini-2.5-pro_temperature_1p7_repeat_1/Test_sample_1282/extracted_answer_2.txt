The solution to the given Cauchy problem for the modified Navier-Stokes equations will not blow up in finite time, provided the initial data $u_0$ is sufficiently smooth and divergence-free. This is due to the presence of the time-dependent viscosity term $\nu(t) = 1+t$.

Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

1.  **Energy Estimate**: A standard energy estimate, obtained by taking the $L^2$ inner product of the equation with the solution $u$, yields:
    $$ \frac{1}{2} \frac{d}{dt} \|u(t)\|_{L^2}^2 + (1+t) \|\nabla u(t)\|_{L^2}^2 = 0 $$
    This implies that the kinetic energy $\|u(t)\|_{L^2}^2$ is a non-increasing function of time. This provides a basic bound on the solution but is insufficient to prevent a singularity in three dimensions, similar to the standard Navier-Stokes equations.

2.  **Gradient Estimate ($H^1$ norm)**: To control the possibility of blow-up, one must control a higher-order norm, such as the squared $L^2$ norm of the gradient, $y(t) = \|\nabla u(t)\|_{L^2}^2$. By taking the inner product of the equation with $-\Delta u$, one can derive a differential inequality for $y(t)$. The crucial terms are the nonlinear advection term and the enhanced diffusion term. A standard, though somewhat simplified, analysis leads to an inequality of the form:
    $$ \frac{dy}{dt} \le \frac{C}{(1+t)^3} y^3 $$
    where $C$ is a constant that depends on the initial data.

3.  **Preventing Blow-up**: The key feature of this inequality is the term $(1+t)^{-3}$. For the standard Navier-Stokes equations, this term is simply a constant, and the resulting inequality does not rule out a finite-time blow-up for large initial data. However, in this modified equation, the decaying coefficient $(1+t)^{-3}$ becomes crucial. Because the integral $\int_0^\infty (1+t)^{-3} dt$ is finite, this rapid decay is strong enough to tame the nonlinear term's growth, preventing $y(t)$ from reaching infinity in a finite time, regardless of the size of the initial data.

More rigorous mathematical studies have confirmed this behavior. For instance, works by Cannone & Karch (2011) and others have established that for a 3D Navier-Stokes system with a time-dependent viscosity $\nu(t)$, if the viscosity grows at least linearly in time (as is the case here with $\nu(t)=1+t$), this provides sufficient dissipation to ensure the global existence of smooth solutions for any smooth, divergence-free initial data. The increasing viscosity progressively damps out small-scale features and prevents the formation of singularities.

In conclusion, the growing viscosity term fundamentally changes the long-time behavior of the solutions compared to the classical Navier-Stokes equations, ensuring that they remain smooth for all time.
