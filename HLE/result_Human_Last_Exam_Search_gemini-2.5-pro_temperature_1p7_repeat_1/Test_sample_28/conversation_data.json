    "The Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) dimension is a measure of the capacity of a hypothesis class. It is defined as the size of the largest set of points that can be \"shattered\" by the hypothesis class. A set of points is shattered if for every possible binary labeling of these points, there exists a hypothesis in the class that can produce that labeling.\n\nThe hypothesis class in question is $H_{z-ones}=\\{h:X \\to \\{0,1\\}: |\\{x: h(x)=1\\}|=z\\}$. This is the set of all binary functions on a domain $X$ of size $T$ that assign exactly $z$ ones. It is assumed that $1 \\le z \\le T$, as $z$ is a positive integer and the class would be empty if $z>T$.\n\nTo determine the VC dimension of $H_{z-ones}$, we need to find the size of the largest subset of $X$ that can be shattered by this class. Let's consider a subset $S \\subseteq X$ with size $k$, i.e., $|S|=k$.\n\nFor $H_{z-ones}$ to shatter $S$, it must be able to realize all $2^k$ possible labelings of the elements in $S$. Let's analyze a single labeling of $S$. Suppose this labeling assigns '1' to $k_1$ points and '0' to the remaining $k-k_1$ points.\n\nFor a hypothesis $h \\in H_{z-ones}$ to be consistent with this labeling, it must assign '1' to those $k_1$ points in $S$. The defining constraint of $H_{z-ones}$ is that $h$ must output exactly $z$ ones across the entire domain $X$. Since $k_1$ ones are already assigned to points in $S$, the remaining $z-k_1$ ones must be assigned to points in the complement set $X \\setminus S$. The size of this complement set is $|X \\setminus S| = T - k$.\n\nThis assignment is only possible if the number of ones we need to assign, $z-k_1$, is both non-negative and does not exceed the number of available points in $X \\setminus S$. This gives us two conditions:\n1.  $z - k_1 \\ge 0 \\implies z \\ge k_1$\n2.  $z - k_1 \\le T - k$\n\nFor the set $S$ to be shattered, these two conditions must hold for *all* possible labelings of $S$. Therefore, they must hold for all possible values of $k_1$, which can range from $0$ to $k$.\n\nWe check the most restrictive cases for $k_1$:\n*   The first condition, $z \\ge k_1$, must hold for the largest possible value of $k_1$, which is $k$. This implies $z \\ge k$.\n*   The second condition, $z - k_1 \\le T - k$, must hold for the smallest possible value of $k_1$, which is $0$. This implies $z \\le T - k$, or equivalently, $k \\le T - z$.\n\nThus, a set of size $k$ can be shattered if and only if both $k \\le z$ and $k \\le T-z$ are satisfied. This means that $k$ must be less than or equal to the minimum of these two values. So, any set of size $k \\le \\min(z, T-z)$ can be shattered.\n\nThe VC dimension is the size of the largest set that can be shattered. Based on this, the VC dimension is at least $\\min(z, T-z)$. To confirm this is the exact VC dimension, we must show that no set of size $k = \\min(z, T-z) + 1$ can be shattered.\n\nThere are two cases:\n1.  If $z \\le T-z$, then $\\min(z, T-z) = z$. Let's try to shatter a set $S$ of size $k = z+1$. Consider the labeling that assigns '1' to all $z+1$ points in $S$. To realize this labeling, a hypothesis would need to output at least $z+1$ ones. However, any hypothesis in $H_{z-ones}$ can only output a total of $z$ ones. Therefore, this labeling cannot be realized, and the set $S$ is not shattered.\n2.  If $T-z < z$, then $\\min(z, T-z) = T-z$. Let's try to shatter a set $S$ of size $k = T-z+1$. Consider the labeling that assigns '0' to all points in $S$. For this labeling, $k_1=0$. To find a consistent hypothesis, we must assign $z-k_1 = z$ ones to the points in $X \\setminus S$. The size of this set is $|X \\setminus S| = T - k = T - (T-z+1) = z-1$. It is impossible to assign $z$ ones to a set containing only $z-1$ points. Therefore, this labeling cannot be realized, and the set $S$ is not shattered.\n\nIn both scenarios, any set of size $\\min(z, T-z) + 1$ cannot be shattered. This confirms that the largest size of a set that can be shattered is $\\min(z, T-z)$.\n\n<<<The VC dimension of the class $H_{z-ones}$ is $\\min(z, T-z)$.>>>"
