    "A finite Weyl group is a finite group generated by reflections in a Euclidean space that preserves a lattice. The rank of a Weyl group corresponds to the dimension of this Euclidean space. Any finite Weyl group can be decomposed into a direct product of irreducible Weyl groups. The classification of irreducible finite Weyl groups is done using Dynkin diagrams.\n\nTo determine the number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4, we must consider both the irreducible and reducible cases.\n\n### Irreducible Weyl Groups of Rank 4\n\nThe irreducible finite Weyl groups are classified by the connected Dynkin diagrams of types A_n, B_n, C_n, D_n, E_6, E_7, E_8, F_4, and G_2. The rank of the group is given by the subscript 'n' for the classical families and by a fixed number for the exceptional ones. We list the irreducible Weyl groups that have a rank of 4:\n*   **A_4**\n*   **B_4**\n*   **C_4**\n*   **D_4**\n*   **F_4**\n\nThe Weyl groups B_n and C_n are isomorphic only for n=2. For n ≥ 3, they are distinct. Thus, B_4 and C_4 are not isomorphic. This gives a total of **5** non-isomorphic irreducible Weyl groups of rank 4.\n\n### Reducible Weyl Groups of Rank 4\n\nA reducible Weyl group of rank 4 is a direct product of lower-rank irreducible Weyl groups, where the sum of their ranks is 4. The possible partitions of the integer 4 are 3+1, 2+2, 2+1+1, and 1+1+1+1. We need to identify the non-isomorphic irreducible Weyl groups of ranks 1, 2, and 3.\n\n*   **Rank 1:** A_1\n*   **Rank 2:** A_2, B_2 (which is isomorphic to C_2), G_2\n*   **Rank 3:** A_3, B_3, C_3\n\nNow we can construct the reducible Weyl groups for each partition of 4:\n\n*   **Partition 3+1:** These are formed by the product of a rank 3 group and a rank 1 group.\n    *   A_3 × A_1\n    *   B_3 × A_1\n    *   C_3 × A_1\n    This gives **3** non-isomorphic groups.\n\n*   **Partition 2+2:** These are formed by the product of two rank 2 groups.\n    *   A_2 × A_2\n    *   B_2 × B_2\n    *   G_2 × G_2\n    *   A_2 × B_2\n    *   A_2 × G_2\n    *   B_2 × G_2\n    This gives **6** non-isomorphic groups.\n\n*   **Partition 2+1+1:** These are formed by the product of one rank 2 group and two rank 1 groups.\n    *   A_2 × A_1 × A_1\n    *   B_2 × A_1 × A_1\n    *   G_2 × A_1 × A_1\n    This gives **3** non-isomorphic groups.\n\n*   **Partition 1+1+1+1:** This is formed by the product of four rank 1 groups.\n    *   A_1 × A_1 × A_1 × A_1\n    This gives **1** non-isomorphic group.\n\nSumming up all the possibilities, the total number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4 is the sum of the numbers from the irreducible and all reducible cases:\n\n5 (irreducible) + 3 (partition 3+1) + 6 (partition 2+2) + 3 (partition 2+1+1) + 1 (partition 1+1+1+1) = 18.\n\n<<<18>>>"
