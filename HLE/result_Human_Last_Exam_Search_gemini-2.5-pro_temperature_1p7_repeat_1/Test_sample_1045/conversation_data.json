    "For a 6-31G basis set calculation of toluene (C7H8), the total number of contracted Gaussian functions is determined by the number of functions assigned to each atom.\n\nFirst, the molecular formula of toluene, C7H8, indicates that it is composed of 7 carbon atoms and 8 hydrogen atoms.\n\nFor the 6-31G basis set:\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** Each hydrogen atom is described by two contracted basis functions. The 1s orbital is split into two parts: one function is a contraction of 3 primitive Gaussian functions, and the second is a single primitive Gaussian function.\n*   **Carbon (C):** Each carbon atom, a second-row element, is described by nine contracted basis functions. This is broken down as follows:\n    *   The core 1s orbital is represented by a single contracted function (composed of 6 primitive Gaussians).\n    *   The valence 2s and 2p orbitals are each split into two basis functions (a \"double-zeta\" representation). This results in two functions for the 2s orbital and two functions for each of the three 2p orbitals (2px, 2py, 2pz).\n    *   Therefore, the total for each carbon atom is 1 (for 1s) + 2 (for 2s) + (3 x 2) (for 2p) = 9 functions.\n\nTo calculate the total number of contracted Gaussian functions for toluene, we multiply the number of each type of atom by the number of basis functions per atom and sum the results:\n\n*   **For the 7 Carbon atoms:** 7 atoms × 9 functions/atom = 63 functions\n*   **For the 8 Hydrogen atoms:** 8 atoms × 2 functions/atom = 16 functions\n\nThe total number of contracted Gaussian functions is the sum of these two values: 63 + 16 = 79.\n\n<<<79>>>"
