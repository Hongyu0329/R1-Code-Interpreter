    "To design an observer for the discrete-time system such that the observation error becomes identically zero in the shortest possible number of steps, we need to create a deadbeat observer. The observer gain matrix must be designed to place all the eigenvalues of the observer error dynamics matrix at the origin, and the error must vanish in a number of steps equal to the observability index of the system.\n\nThe system is given by:\nx(k + 1) = Ax(k) + Bu(k)\ny(k) = Cx(k)\n\nwith the matrices:\nA = [-1 0 0 1; 1 0 0 2; 0 1 0 -1; -1 0 1 -1]\nB = [0; 1; -1; 1]\nC = [1 0 0 0; 1 0 0 1]\n\nThe observer dynamics are:\nx̂(k + 1) = Ax̂(k) + Bu(k) + L(y(k) - ŷ(k))\nwhere ŷ(k) = Cx̂(k) and L is the observer gain matrix to be designed.\n\nThe observation error is e(k) = x(k) - x̂(k). The error dynamics are given by:\ne(k + 1) = (A - LC)e(k)\n\nFor a deadbeat observer, the error must go to zero in the shortest possible time. This time is the observability index, ν, of the system (A, C). The condition for the error to be zero for k ≥ ν is that the matrix M = A - LC is nilpotent with an index of nilpotency equal to ν, i.e., M^ν = 0.\n\nFirst, let's determine the observability index ν for this system, which has n=4 states and p=2 outputs. We need to find the smallest integer ν such that the observability matrix O_ν = [C; CA; ...; CA^(ν-1)] has rank n=4.\n\n*   For ν = 1, the rank of O_1 = C is 2.\n*   For ν = 2, we check the rank of O_2 = [C; CA].\n    C = [,]\n    CA = [[-1, 0, 0, 1], [-2, 0, 1, 0]]\n    The matrix O_2 is [,, [-1, 0, 0, 1], [-2, 0, 1, 0]]. The rank of O_2 is 3.\n*   For ν = 3, we check the rank of O_3 = [C; CA; CA^2].\n    CA^2 = [[0, 0, 1, -2], [0, 1, 0, -2]]\n    The matrix O_3 contains the rows of O_2 plus the two rows of CA^2. The set of row vectors {,, [-2,0,1,0], [0,1,0,-2]} is linearly independent (forms a 4x4 matrix with a non-zero determinant). Therefore, the rank of O_3 is 4.\n\nThe observability index is ν = 3. We must find a gain matrix L such that (A - LC)^3 = 0.\n\nLet's analyze the structure of M = A - LC.\nL is a 4x2 matrix. `LC = L * [[1, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 1]] = [[l11+l12, 0, 0, l12], [l21+l22, 0, 0, l22], [l31+l32, 0, 0, l32], [l41+l42, 0, 0, l42]]`\nThe matrix M = A - LC is:\nM = [[-1-(l11+l12), 0, 0, 1-l12],\n     [1-(l21+l22),  0, 0, 2-l22],\n     [-(l31+l32),   1, 0, -1-l32],\n     [-1-(l41+l42), 0, 1, -1-l42]]\n\nLet e_i be the standard basis vectors. We can observe the following relationships from the structure of M:\n*   Me_2 =^T = e_3\n*   Me_3 =^T = e_4\n\nThis gives us a chain of transformations: e_2 → e_3 → e_4.\nFor M to be nilpotent with index 3, we can enforce a Jordan chain structure. Let's make this chain terminate at M e_4, i.e., M e_4 = 0.\nM e_4 is the fourth column of M. Setting it to zero gives:\n*   1 - l12 = 0  => l12 = 1\n*   2 - l22 = 0  => l22 = 2\n*   -1 - l32 = 0 => l32 = -1\n*   -1 - l42 = 0 => l42 = -1\n\nThis determines the second column of L. With this choice, M e_4 = 0.\nConsequently, M^2 e_3 = M(M e_3) = M e_4 = 0.\nAnd M^3 e_2 = M^2(M e_2) = M^2 e_3 = 0.\n\nNow we need to ensure that the action of M on e_1 also results in zero after 3 steps, i.e., M^3 e_1 = 0.\nM e_1 is the first column of M:\nc_1 = [-1-(l11+l12), 1-(l21+l22), -(l31+l32), -1-(l41+l42)]^T\n\nUsing the values we found for the second column of L:\nc_1 = [-2-l11, -1-l21, 1-l31, -l41]^T\n`M^2 e_1 = M c_1 = (-2-l11)c_1 + (-1-l21)e_3 + (1-l31)e_4 + (-l41)(M e_4)`\nSince M e_4 = 0, this simplifies to:\n`M^2 e_1 = (-2-l11)c_1 + (-1-l21)e_3 + (1-l31)e_4`\n\nThen, `M^3 e_1 = M (M^2 e_1)`:\n`M^3 e_1 = (-2-l11)Mc_1 + (-1-l21)Me_3 + (1-l31)Me_4`\n`M^3 e_1 = (-2-l11)Mc_1 + (-1-l21)e_4`\n\nTo make M^3 e_1 = 0, we can choose the `l_i1` values to make both terms zero.\nSet `-2-l11 = 0` => `l11 = -2`.\nThis makes the first term zero. The equation becomes:\n`(-1-l21)e_4 = 0`, which means `-1-l21 = 0` => `l21 = -1`.\nThe values of l31 and l41 do not affect the result, so we can set them to zero for simplicity: l31 = 0, l41 = 0.\n\nCombining all the `l_ij` values, we get the observer gain matrix L:\nL = [[-2, 1], [-1, 2], [0, -1], [0, -1]]\n\n<<<L = [[-2, 1], [-1, 2], [0, -1], [0, -1]]>>>"
