    "The Gromov-Hausdorff distance between the interval $$ with the absolute value metric and the unit circle with the intrinsic metric has been calculated in the paper \"Gromov-Hausdorff Distance Between Segment and Circle\" by Yibo Ji and Alexey A. Tuzhilin.\n\nThe unit circle, denoted as $S^1$, with its intrinsic metric has a circumference of $2\\pi$ and a diameter of $\\pi$. The intrinsic metric measures the distance between two points as the length of the shorter arc connecting them. The interval $$ is a line segment of length $\\lambda = 1$.\n\nThe Gromov-Hausdorff distance, $d_{GH}(I_\\lambda, S^1)$, between a segment of length $\\lambda$ and the unit circle is given by a formula that depends on the value of $\\lambda$. According to Theorem 6.8 in the aforementioned paper, the formula is as follows:\n\n$d_{GH}(I_\\lambda, S^1) = \\begin{cases} \\frac{\\lambda}{2} & \\text{if } 0 \\le \\lambda \\le \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\\\ \\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{(\\lambda - \\frac{\\pi}{2})^2 + (\\frac{\\pi}{2})^2} & \\text{if } \\frac{\\pi}{2} < \\lambda < \\pi \\\\ \\frac{\\lambda}{2} - \\frac{\\pi}{4} & \\text{if } \\lambda \\ge \\pi \\end{cases}$\n\nFor the interval $$, we have $\\lambda = 1$. We need to determine which case of the formula applies. Since $\\pi \\approx 3.14159$, we have $\\frac{\\pi}{2} \\approx 1.5708$.\n\nAs $0 \\le 1 \\le \\frac{\\pi}{2}$, the first case of the formula is applicable.\n\nTherefore, for $\\lambda = 1$, the Gromov-Hausdorff distance is:\n$d_{GH}(I_1, S^1) = \\frac{1}{2}$\n\n<<<0.5>>>"
