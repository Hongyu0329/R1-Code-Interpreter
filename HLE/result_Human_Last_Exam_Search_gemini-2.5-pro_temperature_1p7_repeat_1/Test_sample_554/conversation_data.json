    "A hypothetical perfluoronanocar would contain a number of fluorine atoms equivalent to the number of hydrogen atoms in the corresponding non-fluorinated nanocar. The process of perfluorination involves the replacement of all carbon-hydrogen (C-H) bonds with carbon-fluorine (C-F) bonds.\n\nWhile there are various designs for nanocars with different chemical compositions, one specific example found in research is a nanocar with a flexible chassis which has the chemical formula C₃₁₀H₃₄.\n\nIn a hypothetical perfluorination of this specific nanocar, all 34 hydrogen atoms would be substituted with fluorine atoms. This would result in a perfluoronanocar with the formula C₃₁₀F₃₄.\n\nTherefore, this hypothetical perfluoronanocar would contain 34 fluorine atoms.\n\n<<<34>>>"
