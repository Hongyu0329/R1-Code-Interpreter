    "In the problem of spin-orbit coupling for a p-electron, we are considering the addition of the orbital angular momentum (L) and the spin angular momentum (S) to form the total angular momentum (J = L + S).\n\nFor a p-electron, the orbital angular momentum quantum number is **l = 1**. As an electron is a spin-1/2 particle, its spin angular momentum quantum number is **s = 1/2**.\n\nThe total angular momentum quantum number, **j**, can take values ranging from |l - s| to l + s in integer steps.\n*   j_min = |1 - 1/2| = 1/2\n*   j_max = 1 + 1/2 = 3/2\n\nSo, the possible values for **j** are **1/2** and **3/2**.\n\nThe system can be described by states that are simultaneous eigenstates of the operators J² and Jz. The eigenvalues of these operators are given by:\n*   Eigenvalue of J²: ħ² * j(j + 1)\n*   Eigenvalue of Jz: ħ * m_j\n\nwhere m_j can take values from -j to +j in integer steps.\n\nWe can now find the common eigenvalues for the two possible values of j.\n\n### Case 1: j = 3/2\n\nFor the states where the total angular momentum quantum number is j = 3/2:\n*   The eigenvalue of **J²** is:\n    ħ² * (3/2) * (3/2 + 1) = ħ² * (3/2) * (5/2) = **(15/4)ħ²**\n\n*   The possible values for the magnetic quantum number m_j are -3/2, -1/2, 1/2, and 3/2. The corresponding eigenvalues for **Jz** are:\n    **(-3/2)ħ, (-1/2)ħ, (1/2)ħ, (3/2)ħ**\n\nThis gives a set of four common eigenvalue pairs for j = 3/2:\n*   ((15/4)ħ², (3/2)ħ)\n*   ((15/4)ħ², (1/2)ħ)\n*   ((15/4)ħ², (-1/2)ħ)\n*   ((15/4)ħ², (-3/2)ħ)\n\n### Case 2: j = 1/2\n\nFor the states where the total angular momentum quantum number is j = 1/2:\n*   The eigenvalue of **J²** is:\n    ħ² * (1/2) * (1/2 + 1) = ħ² * (1/2) * (3/2) = **(3/4)ħ²**\n\n*   The possible values for the magnetic quantum number m_j are -1/2 and 1/2. The corresponding eigenvalues for **Jz** are:\n    **(-1/2)ħ, (1/2)ħ**\n\nThis gives a set of two common eigenvalue pairs for j = 1/2:\n*   ((3/4)ħ², (1/2)ħ)\n*   ((3/4)ħ², (-1/2)ħ)\n\n<<<In summary, the common eigenvalues for J² and Jz are determined by the possible values of the total angular momentum quantum number, j.\n\nFor **j = 3/2**, the J² eigenvalue is **(15/4)ħ²**, and the corresponding Jz eigenvalues are **(3/2)ħ, (1/2)ħ, (-1/2)ħ, and (-3/2)ħ**.\n\nFor **j = 1/2**, the J² eigenvalue is **(3/4)ħ²**, and the corresponding Jz eigenvalues are **(1/2)ħ and (-1/2)ħ**.>>>"
