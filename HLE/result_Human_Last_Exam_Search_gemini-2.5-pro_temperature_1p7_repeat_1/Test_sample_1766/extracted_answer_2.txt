In summary, the common eigenvalues for J² and Jz are determined by the possible values of the total angular momentum quantum number, j.

For **j = 3/2**, the J² eigenvalue is **(15/4)ħ²**, and the corresponding Jz eigenvalues are **(3/2)ħ, (1/2)ħ, (-1/2)ħ, and (-3/2)ħ**.

For **j = 1/2**, the J² eigenvalue is **(3/4)ħ²**, and the corresponding Jz eigenvalues are **(1/2)ħ and (-1/2)ħ**.
