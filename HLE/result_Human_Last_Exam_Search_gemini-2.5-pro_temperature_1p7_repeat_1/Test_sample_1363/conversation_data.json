    "In the world of ballroom dancing, the technique of each dance is built on a foundation of specific principles governing movement, timing, and interaction between the partners. When considering the reverse turn, one dance stands out where overturning this figure is technically impossible without violating its core principles: the European Tango.\n\nThe fundamental technique of the European Tango's Reverse Turn, particularly the Open Reverse Turn, dictates that at a specific point in the figure, all rotation should cease. On the third step of the man's part (lady's third step), as he steps outside his partner, there is no turn. The movement is intended to be linear at this point. Continuing to rotate through this step would create what is described as a \"wrong shape\" and is a clear breach of the established technique.\n\nIn contrast, the other dances listed allow for, and even have named variations of, overturned turns:\n\n*   **Viennese Waltz:** While overturning a reverse turn to navigate a corner is exceptionally difficult and generally avoided in favor of a natural turn, it is not considered technically impossible in the same definitive sense as in the Tango. It is more a matter of practicality and maintaining the dance's characteristic flow.\n\n*   **English Waltz, Slow Foxtrot, and Quickstep:** These dances all have well-documented and accepted \"overturned\" versions of their turns. For instance, the Waltz features figures like the Overturned Spin Turn. The Slow Foxtrot and Quickstep syllabi also include overturned figures as advanced variations, demonstrating that their techniques are adaptable to increased rotation.\n\nThe staccato nature and sharp, precise movements of the European Tango are what make the \"no turn\" rule on the outside step of the reverse turn so crucial. To overturn the figure would require a continuous, flowing rotation that directly contradicts this fundamental technical element. Therefore, it is impossible to overturn a reverse turn in the European Tango without disregarding its established technique.\n\n<<<C>>>"
