    "## Nobel Laureates Featured in Infamous 2000 Enron Ad\n\nThe two Nobel laureates who appeared in an infamous 2000 commercial for the energy company Enron, under the tagline \"Ask Why,\" were physicist Murray Gell-Mann and economist Amartya Sen.\n\nThe advertising campaign, which preceded Enron's massive corporate scandal and collapse, has since been viewed with considerable irony. The commercials aimed to portray Enron as a forward-thinking and innovative company that questioned conventional wisdom.\n\n**Murray Gell-Mann**, an American physicist, was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1969 for his work on the theory of elementary particles. He is credited with introducing the concept of quarks.\n\n**Amartya Sen**, an Indian economist and philosopher, received the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 1998 for his contributions to welfare economics and social choice theory. His work has focused on issues of famine, poverty, and the development of practical solutions to limit food shortages.\n\nA Reddit thread discussing the commercial correctly identified Gell-Mann and mentioned the presence of an \"Indian commentator,\" who was later confirmed to be Sen. At the time of the commercial's airing in 2000, both men were already Nobel laureates. The campaign, and the subsequent downfall of Enron in 2001 due to a massive accounting fraud scandal, has made the laureates' appearance a curious footnote in the company's notorious history.\n\n<<<Murray Gell-Mann and Amartya Sen>>>"
