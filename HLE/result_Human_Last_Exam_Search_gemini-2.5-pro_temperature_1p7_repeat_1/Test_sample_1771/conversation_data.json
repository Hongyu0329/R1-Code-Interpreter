    "The Proto-Indo-European (PIE) verb *seh₂gieti, meaning '(s)he’s giving a sign', developed into various forms in the Germanic languages. Its root, *seh₂g-, means \"to track down\" or \"seek out\". This root is also related to the Latin verb *sāgīre*, which means \"to perceive keenly\".\n\nHere is the lineage of PIE *seh2gieti in Proto-Germanic, Old Norse, Old English, and Old High German:\n\n**Proto-Germanic:** **sōkijaną* or **sokjanan***\n\nThe transformation from PIE *seh₂gieti to Proto-Germanic **sōkijaną* involved several key sound changes:\n*   The PIE root *seh₂g- became the Proto-Germanic root *sōk-. This change reflects Grimm's Law, where the voiced velar stop *g shifted to a voiceless *k. The vowel change is a result of the PIE laryngeal *h₂ coloring the adjacent *e to an *a*, which then becomes *ō in Proto-Germanic.\n*   The PIE present tense suffix *-yeti evolved into the Proto-Germanic suffix for class 1 weak verbs, *-janą*.\n\n**Old Norse:** **sǿkja***\n\nIn Old Norse, the Proto-Germanic **sōkijaną* underwent i-umlaut, where the /j/ in the suffix caused the preceding /o/ to be fronted to /œ/ (represented by the character 'ǿ'). The final portion of the word was also reduced. The verb in Old Norse meant \"to seek, look for, search; to strive; to attack\".\n\n**Old English:** **sēċan***\n\nIn Old English, the Proto-Germanic **sōkijaną* also experienced i-umlaut, which fronted the root vowel *ō* to *ē*. The palatalization of /k/ to /t͡ʃ/ (written as 'c') before the front vowel is a characteristic feature of Old English. The verb *sēċan* meant \"to look for, seek\".\n\n**Old High German:** **suohhen***\n\nIn Old High German, the Proto-Germanic **sōkijaną* evolved into *suohhen*. Here, the Proto-Germanic *ō* diphthongized to *uo*. The verb meant \"to seek, search\".\n\n<<<**Proto-Germanic:** *sōkijaną*\n**Old Norse:** *sǿkja*\n**Old English:** *sēċan*\n**Old High German:** *suohhen*>>>"
