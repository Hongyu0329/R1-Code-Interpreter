    "The scansion for the line \"et tibi bene esse soli quom sibi sit male,\" which comes from Terence's play *Adelphoe* (line 34), is an example of an iambic octonarius. This meter consists of eight iambic (S L) feet. In Roman comedy, this meter allows for many substitutions and resolutions, which can make scansion complex.\n\nA scholarly analysis of the line breaks it down as follows, acknowledging elision (where `bene esse` is pronounced `benesse`) and resolution (where a single long beat is replaced by two short syllables):\n\n<<<S S S S | S L S L | S L | S S L L S>>>"
