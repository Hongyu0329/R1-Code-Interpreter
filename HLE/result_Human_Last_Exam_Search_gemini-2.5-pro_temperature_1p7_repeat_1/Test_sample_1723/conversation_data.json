    "## No Known Mushroom Genus Produces a Distinctly Blue Spore Print\n\nContrary to the premise of the inquiry, extensive research and mycological data indicate that there is no single genus of mushroom known to produce a distinctly blue spore print. While numerous fungi exhibit striking blue coloration in their caps, stems, or flesh, their spore prints are consistently found to be other colors.\n\nSeveral well-known blue-hued mushrooms illustrate this point. The vibrant *Lactarius indigo*, for instance, while exuding a blue \"milk,\" possesses a cream to pale yellowish spore print. Similarly, the *Entoloma hochstetteri*, a mushroom native to New Zealand and known for its all-blue appearance, has a reddish-pink spore print.\n\nOther examples include the Blue Roundhead (*Stropharia caerulea*), which has a purple-brown to purplish-black spore print, and the wavy-capped *Psilocybe cyanescens*, known for its blue bruising, which produces a purple-brown to purple-gray spore print.\n\nSpore print color is a critical characteristic for mushroom identification and does not necessarily correlate with the mushroom's external appearance. The available evidence from mycological resources and scientific literature does not support the existence of a mushroom genus that produces blue spores.\n\n<<<There is no known mushroom genus that produces a distinctly blue spore print.>>>"
