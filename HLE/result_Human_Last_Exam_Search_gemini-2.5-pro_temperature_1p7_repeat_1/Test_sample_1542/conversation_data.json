    "Over the finite ring R = Z/8Z, there are 28 equivalence classes of quadratic forms in two variables up to invertible linear transforms.\n\nA quadratic form in two variables over a commutative ring R is a polynomial of the form f(x, y) = ax² + bxy + cy² where a, b, and c are elements of R. Two such forms, f(x, y) and g(x, y), are considered equivalent if there exists an invertible linear transformation of the variables that transforms one form into the other. Specifically, g(x,y) is equivalent to f(x,y) if there exist α, β, γ, δ in R such that αδ - βγ is an invertible element of R, and g(x, y) = f(αx + βy, γx + δy).\n\nThe classification of these equivalence classes is a complex problem, particularly for rings of the form Z/2ⁿZ. For the specific case of R = Z/8Z, a detailed analysis reveals that there are 28 such distinct equivalence classes.\n\n<<<28>>>"
