    "To determine the largest $p$ such that the function $I(a_1, \\dots, a_9)$ is not in $L^p(\\mathbb{R}^9)$, we need to find the supremum of all $p$ for which the following integral diverges:\n$$ \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^9} |I(a_1, \\dots, a_9)|^p da_1 \\dots da_9 $$\nThe function $I(\\mathbf{a})$ is an oscillatory integral:\n$$ I(\\mathbf{a}) = \\int_{^2} e^{2\\pi i \\phi(x, y; \\mathbf{a})} dxdy $$\nwhere the phase function is a general cubic polynomial in two variables:\n$$ \\phi(x, y; \\mathbf{a}) = a_1 x+a_2 y + a_3 x^2 + a_4 xy + a_5 y^2 + a_6 x^3 + a_7 x^2 y + a_8 x y^2 + a_9 y^3 $$\nThe convergence of the $L^p$ integral of $I(\\mathbf{a})$ depends on the decay rate of $|I(\\mathbf{a})|$ as $|\\mathbf{a}| \\to \\infty$. This decay rate is not uniform in all directions of the 9-dimensional space of coefficients $\\mathbf{a}$. We must find the direction of slowest decay, as this will dominate the divergence of the $L^p$ integral.\n\nThe decay rate of such an oscillatory integral is determined by the highest possible degeneracy of a critical point of the phase function.\n\n1.  **Generic Decay**: For a generic $\\mathbf{a}$, the gradient $\\nabla \\phi = (\\partial_x \\phi, \\partial_y \\phi)$ will not vanish within the domain $^2$. In this case, integration by parts shows that $I(\\mathbf{a})$ decays faster than any power of $|\\mathbf{a}|^{-1}$, typically as $|\\mathbf{a}|^{-1}$ due to contributions from the boundary of the integration domain.\n\n2.  **Stationary Phase Decay**: If for certain $\\mathbf{a}$ the phase has a non-degenerate critical point inside $^2$ (i.e., $\\nabla \\phi(x_0, y_0) = 0$ and the Hessian determinant $\\det(H(x_0,y_0)) \\neq 0$), the method of stationary phase indicates a decay of $|I(\\mathbf{a})| \\sim |\\det H|^{-1/2}$. The Hessian's entries are linear in $\\mathbf{a}$, so its determinant is quadratic. This would imply a decay of roughly $|\\mathbf{a}|^{-1}$.\n\n3.  **Degenerate Critical Points and Slowest Decay**: The slowest decay occurs when the critical point is degenerate. We seek to choose coefficients $\\mathbf{a}$ to make the phase function as \"flat\" as possible around some point $(x_0, y_0) \\in^2$. We can choose $(x_0, y_0) = (1/2, 1/2)$ to be specific.\n    To maximize the degeneracy at $(x_0, y_0)$, we set the derivatives of the phase $\\phi$ to zero. The Taylor expansion of $\\phi$ around $(x_0, y_0)$ is:\n    $$ \\phi(x,y) = \\phi(x_0,y_0) + c_{10}(x-x_0) + c_{01}(y-y_0) + \\frac{1}{2!}(c_{20}(x-x_0)^2 + \\dots) + \\frac{1}{3!}(c_{30}(x-x_0)^3+\\dots) $$\n    The Taylor coefficients $c_{km}$ are linear combinations of the $a_j$. To make the phase as flat as possible, we set the low-order coefficients to zero.\n    -   Vanishing gradient: $c_{10} = 0, c_{01} = 0$. These are two linear conditions on $\\mathbf{a}$.\n    -   Vanishing quadratic terms (degenerate critical point): $c_{20} = 0, c_{11} = 0, c_{02} = 0$. These are three more linear conditions on $\\mathbf{a}$.\n\n    We have a total of 5 linear homogeneous equations in the 9 variables $a_1, \\dots, a_9$. One can verify that these 5 equations are linearly independent. Thus, the set of coefficients $\\mathbf{a}$ that produces such a degenerate critical point at $(x_0, y_0)$ forms a linear subspace of $\\mathbb{R}^9$. Let's call this subspace $V$. The dimension of $V$ is $9 - 5 = 4$.\n\n    For $\\mathbf{u} \\in V$, the phase function starts with cubic terms. A scaling argument shows that the integral decays as $|I(\\mathbf{u})| \\sim |\\mathbf{u}|^{-2/3}$. Let this decay rate be $\\sigma_u = 2/3$.\n\n    Now consider the orthogonal complement $V^\\perp$, which has dimension $5$. For $\\mathbf{v} \\in V^\\perp$, the phase will generally have non-vanishing quadratic terms (assuming the linear terms are made to vanish by other constraints). For a phase dominated by quadratic terms, the integral decays as $|I(\\mathbf{v})| \\sim |\\mathbf{v}|^{-1}$. Let this decay rate be $\\sigma_v = 1$.\n\n4.  **Estimating the $L^p$ Integral**: To determine the critical exponent $p$, we can use an anisotropic integration method. We decompose $\\mathbb{R}^9$ as the direct sum $V \\oplus V^\\perp \\cong \\mathbb{R}^4 \\times \\mathbb{R}^5$. An arbitrary vector $\\mathbf{a}$ can be written as $(\\mathbf{u}, \\mathbf{v})$ with $\\mathbf{u} \\in V$ and $\\mathbf{v} \\in V^\\perp$. Let $r_u = |\\mathbf{u}|$ and $r_v = |\\mathbf{v}|$. The decay of $|I(\\mathbf{a})|$ is roughly governed by the slower of the two rates, so $|I(\\mathbf{a})| \\sim \\min(r_u^{-\\sigma_u}, r_v^{-\\sigma_v}) = \\min(r_u^{-2/3}, r_v^{-1})$.\n\n    The integral becomes:\n    $$ \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^5} \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^4} |I(\\mathbf{u}, \\mathbf{v})|^p d\\mathbf{u} d\\mathbf{v} \\approx \\int_0^\\infty \\int_0^\\infty \\left( \\min(r_u^{-2/3}, r_v^{-1}) \\right)^p (C_u r_u^{3} dr_u) (C_v r_v^{4} dr_v) $$\n    The region of integration in $(r_u, r_v)$ space is split by the condition $r_u^{-2/3} = r_v^{-1}$, which is $r_u = r_v^{3/2}$.\n\n    *   **Region 1: $r_u > r_v^{3/2}$**. The decay term is $r_u^{-2p/3}$. The integral is:\n        $$ \\int_0^\\infty r_v^4 \\left( \\int_{r_v^{3/2}}^\\infty r_u^3 \\cdot r_u^{-2p/3} dr_u \\right) dr_v $$\n        The inner integral $\\int r_u^{3-2p/3} dr_u$ converges if $3 - 2p/3 < -1$, which means $p>6$. Its value is proportional to $(r_v^{3/2})^{4-2p/3} = r_v^{6-p}$.\n        The outer integral is then $\\int_0^\\infty r_v^4 \\cdot r_v^{6-p} dr_v = \\int_0^\\infty r_v^{10-p} dr_v$. This converges if $10-p < -1$, which means $p>11$.\n\n    *   **Region 2: $r_u < r_v^{3/2}$**. The decay term is $r_v^{-p}$. The integral is:\n        $$ \\int_0^\\infty r_v^4 \\cdot r_v^{-p} \\left( \\int_0^{r_v^{3/2}} r_u^3 dr_u \\right) dr_v $$\n        The inner integral is $\\frac{1}{4}(r_v^{3/2})^4 = \\frac{1}{4} r_v^6$.\n        The outer integral is $\\int_0^\\infty r_v^{4-p} \\cdot r_v^6 dr_v = \\int_0^\\infty r_v^{10-p} dr_v$. This also converges if $10-p < -1$, which means $p>11$.\n\n    Both regions require $p>11$ for the integral to converge. Therefore, the integral $\\int |I(\\mathbf{a})|^p d\\mathbf{a}$ converges for $p>11$ and diverges for $p \\le 11$.\n\nThe largest value of $p$ for which the function $I$ is not in $L^p(\\mathbb{R}^9)$ is the supremum of the set of $p$ for which the $L^p$ integral diverges. This corresponds to the critical exponent itself.\n\n<<<11>>>"
