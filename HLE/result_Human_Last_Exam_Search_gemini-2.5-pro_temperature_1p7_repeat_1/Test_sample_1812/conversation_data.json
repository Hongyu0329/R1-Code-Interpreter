    "The determinant of the given matrix is 0.\n\nThe determinant of the matrix\n\\[\nA = \\begin{bmatrix}\n2 & -1 & -1 \\\\\n-1 & 2 & -1 \\\\\n-1 & -1 & 2\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nis calculated as follows:\ndet(A) = 2 * (2 * 2 - (-1) * (-1)) - (-1) * ((-1) * 2 - (-1) * (-1)) + (-1) * ((-1) * (-1) - 2 * (-1))\ndet(A) = 2 * (4 - 1) + 1 * (-2 - 1) - 1 * (1 + 2)\ndet(A) = 2 * 3 - 3 - 3\ndet(A) = 6 - 6 = 0\n\nAn alternative way to see this is to note that the sum of the elements in each row is 0.\nRow 1: 2 + (-1) + (-1) = 0\nRow 2: -1 + 2 + (-1) = 0\nRow 3: -1 + (-1) + 2 = 0\nWhen the rows of a matrix sum to zero, it means the vector is in the null space of the matrix. This implies that the matrix is singular, and therefore its determinant is 0.\n\nThe search results discuss the Markov quiver and its association with cluster algebras and Diophantine equations, but do not change the fact that the determinant of the specifically provided matrix A is 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
