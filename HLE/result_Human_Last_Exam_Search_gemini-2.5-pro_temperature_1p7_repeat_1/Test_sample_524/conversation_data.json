    "There are four homeomorphism classes of homogeneous planar continua.\n\nA homogeneous space is one where for any two points, there exists a homeomorphism of the space onto itself that maps the first point to the second. A planar continuum is a compact and connected subset of the plane.\n\nThe classification of homogeneous planar continua results in the following four distinct classes:\n\n*   **The point:** This is a degenerate continuum, consisting of a single point.\n*   **The circle:** The familiar simple closed curve.\n*   **The pseudo-arc:** A fractal-like object that is hereditarily indecomposable, meaning it cannot be broken down into two smaller proper continua.\n*   **The circle of pseudo-arcs:** This is a continuous collection of pseudo-arcs arranged in a circle.\n\nA complete classification proving that these are the only non-degenerate homogeneous planar continua was provided by Logan C. Hoehn and Lex G. Oversteegen in 2014. Prior to this, the circle was known to be a homogeneous continuum, and the pseudo-arc and the circle of pseudo-arcs were shown to be additional examples by R. H. Bing and F. Burton Jones in the mid-20th century.\n\nIt was a long-standing problem in topology to determine if any other such continua existed. Jones had classified these continua into three types: those that do not separate the plane, those that are decomposable and separate the plane, and those that are indecomposable and separate the plane. The pseudo-arc is of the first type, the circle and the circle of pseudo-arcs are of the second type, and it was eventually proven that no continua of the third type exist.\n\n<<<4>>>"
