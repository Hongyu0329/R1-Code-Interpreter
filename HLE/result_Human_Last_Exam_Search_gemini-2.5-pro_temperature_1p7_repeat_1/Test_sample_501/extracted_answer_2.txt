The force law is $F(x) = \frac{2 E(0) x}{n^2 \ell^2} \exp\left(-\frac{x^2}{n^2 \ell^2}\right)$, where $x$ is the separation of the ends, $\ell$ is the length of a single strut, $n$ is the number of mass points (and struts, for large $n$), and $E(0)$ is the kinetic energy of the polymer at zero extension.
