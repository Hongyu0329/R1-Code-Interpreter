    "Pure allotropes of phosphorus can be observed in at least five distinct colors: white (which often appears yellow), red, violet, black, and blue.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the colors of the different allotropes of phosphorus:\n\n*   **White Phosphorus:** When pure, this allotrope is a colorless or white waxy solid. However, it rapidly turns yellow when exposed to light, and as such, it is often referred to as yellow phosphorus. It is a translucent material and is highly reactive. In a fascinating phenomenon, white phosphorus also glows greenish in the dark when exposed to oxygen due to chemiluminescence.\n\n*   **Red Phosphorus:** This allotrope is most commonly a deep red color and can have a powdery texture. It can also appear as a reddish-violet powder. Variations in its crystalline structure can lead to an iron-grey lustrous appearance.\n\n*   **Violet Phosphorus:** Also known as Hittorf's phosphorus, this allotrope is typically violet or purple. It can also be found as red/purple crystals. The process of creating it can sometimes yield yellowish-red or brown transparent plates.\n\n*   **Black Phosphorus:** This is the most thermodynamically stable form of phosphorus and appears black and flaky, with a structure similar to graphite. It can also have a grey crystalline appearance.\n\n*   **Blue Phosphorus:** This is a more recently synthesized allotrope that exists as a two-dimensional layer. As its name suggests, it is blue in color.\n\nWhile there are other described shades and glows, the primary and distinct colors associated with pure phosphorus allotropes are white/yellow, red, violet, black, and blue.\n\n<<<5>>>"
