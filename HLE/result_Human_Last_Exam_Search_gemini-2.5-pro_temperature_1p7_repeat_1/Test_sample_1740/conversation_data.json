    "To date, the let-7 family in humans is understood to consist of a number of mature microRNAs (miRNAs) that are produced from a larger number of precursor genes. There is a slight variation in the exact numbers reported in scientific literature, but a general consensus has been established.\n\nIn humans, there are typically cited to be between 9 and 10 distinct mature let-7 family members. These mature miRNAs include let-7a, let-7b, let-7c, let-7d, let-7e, let-7f, let-7g, let-7i, and miR-98. Some sources also include miR-202 as a member of this family.\n\nThese mature miRNAs are encoded by 12 to 13 different precursor genes located on various chromosomes. For instance, the same mature let-7a miRNA is produced from three different precursor genes (let-7a-1, let-7a-2, and let-7a-3) found on different chromosomes. This is also the case for let-7f, which is produced by two separate genes.\n\nThe discrepancy in the number of members often arises from whether the count refers to the unique mature miRNA sequences or the total number of precursor genes that encode for them. The definitive database for miRNA sequences, miRBase, has been referenced in multiple studies to identify these family members. One 2018 publication discussing miRBase mentioned 11 human let-7 family members.\n\nIn summary, based on current scientific understanding, there are approximately **10 mature let-7 family members** in humans, which are derived from **12 to 13 precursor genes**.\n\n<<<10 mature members and 12-13 precursor genes>>>"
