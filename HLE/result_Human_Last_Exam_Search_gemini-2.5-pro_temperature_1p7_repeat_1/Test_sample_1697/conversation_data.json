    "The reaction described is a classic example of a directed ortho-metalation (DoM) followed by an electrophilic quench.\n\nFirst, the starting material, N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide, is treated with sec-butyllithium (sec-BuLi) and tetramethylethylenediamine (TMEDA) in tetrahydrofuran (THF).\n\n*   **N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide** possesses two functional groups that can direct the lithiation: the N,N-diethylamide group (-CONEt₂) at position 1 and the dimethylamino group (-NMe₂) at position 3.\n*   **sec-BuLi** is a strong base used for deprotonation, and **TMEDA** is a chelating agent that increases the reactivity of the organolithium reagent.\n*   This first step is a **directed ortho-metalation**, where a hydrogen atom on the aromatic ring is replaced by a lithium atom. The position of this substitution is governed by the directing metalation groups (DMGs) present.\n*   Both the amide and the amino groups are effective DMGs. When multiple directing groups are present, lithiation occurs preferentially at the position ortho to the strongest directing group. The N,N-diethylamide group is a significantly more powerful directing group than the dimethylamino group.\n*   The amide group directs lithiation to its ortho positions (C2 and C6), while the dimethylamino group directs to its ortho positions (C2 and C4). The C2 position is doubly activated, being ortho to both groups. Due to the superior directing ability of the amide group and the cooperative effect at the C2 position, deprotonation occurs selectively at C2 to form the aryllithium intermediate.\n\nIn the second step, the newly formed aryllithium intermediate is treated with methyl iodide (CH₃I).\n\n*   The aryllithium compound is a strong nucleophile.\n*   Methyl iodide is an electrophile. The nucleophilic carbon atom at the C2 position attacks the methyl group of methyl iodide, displacing the iodide ion and forming a new carbon-carbon bond.\n\nTherefore, the final product is the compound where a methyl group has been added at the C2 position of the original molecule.\n\n<<<N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide>>>"
