    "To find the 4-point Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) for the specified sequence, we follow a two-step process. First, we determine the original 4-point sequences, x(n) and h(n), by computing the Inverse DFT (IDFT) of their given DFTs, X(k) and H(k). Second, we construct the new 8-point sequence and then determine the appropriate 4-point sequence to transform.\n\n**1. Find the 4-point sequences x(n) and h(n):**\n\nThe IDFT formula for a 4-point sequence `f(n)` from its DFT `F(k)` is:\n`f(n) = (1/4) * Σ[k=0 to 3] F(k) * exp(j * 2 * π * k * n / 4)`\n\nFor `x(n)` with `X(k) = [1, j, -1, -j]`:\n*   x(0) = (1/4) * (1 + j - 1 - j) = 0\n*   x(1) = (1/4) * (1 + j(j) - 1(-1) - j(-j)) = (1/4) * (1 - 1 + 1 - 1) = 0\n*   x(2) = (1/4) * (1 + j(-1) - 1(1) - j(-1)) = (1/4) * (1 - j - 1 + j) = 0\n*   x(3) = (1/4) * (1 + j(-j) - 1(-1) - j(j)) = (1/4) * (1 + 1 + 1 + 1) = 1\nSo, the sequence **x(n) =**.\n\nFor `h(n)` with `H(k) = [0, 1+j, 1, 1-j]`:\n*   h(0) = (1/4) * (0 + 1+j + 1 + 1-j) = 3/4\n*   h(1) = (1/4) * (0 + (1+j)(j) + 1(-1) + (1-j)(-j)) = (1/4) * (j-1 - 1 +j+1) = (1/4) * (-1 + 2j)  - Correction: A careful recalculation shows h(1) = -3/4.\n*   h(2) = (1/4) * (0 + (1+j)(-1) + 1(1) + (1-j)(-1)) = (1/4) * (-1-j + 1 -1+j) = -1/4\n*   h(3) = (1/4) * (0 + (1+j)(-j) + 1(-1) + (1-j)(j)) = (1/4) * (1-j -1 +j+1) = 1/4\nLet's re-calculate `h(1)` and `h(3)` carefully.\n*   h(1) = (1/4) * [H(0) + H(1)e^(jπ/2) + H(2)e^(jπ) + H(3)e^(j3π/2)] = (1/4) * [0 + (1+j)(j) + (1)(-1) + (1-j)(-j)] = (1/4) * [j-1 - 1 + j+1] = (1/4)*(-3) = -3/4\n*   h(3) = (1/4) * [H(0) + H(1)e^(j3π/2) + H(2)e^(j3π) + H(3)e^(j9π/2)] = (1/4) * [0 + (1+j)(-j) + (1)(-1) + (1-j)(j)] = (1/4) * [1-j - 1 + j+1] = 1/4.\nSo, the sequence **h(n) = [3/4, -3/4, -1/4, 1/4]**.\n\n**2. Construct the new sequence and find its 4-point DFT:**\n\nThe new 8-point sequence is `y(n) = {x(0), h(0), x(1), h(1), x(2), h(2), x(3), h(3)}`.\nSubstituting the values of `x(n)` and `h(n)`:\n`y(n) = {0, 3/4, 0, -3/4, 0, -1/4, 1, 1/4}`\n\nThe request for a \"4-point DFT\" of an 8-point sequence implies creating a 4-point sequence through a process called time-domain aliasing. This is a standard operation in digital signal processing. The 4-point sequence, let's call it `z(n)`, is formed by adding the second half of the 8-point sequence to its first half:\n`z(n) = y(n) + y(n+4)` for n = 0, 1, 2, 3.\n\n*   z(0) = y(0) + y(4) = 0 + 0 = 0\n*   z(1) = y(1) + y(5) = 3/4 + (-1/4) = 1/2\n*   z(2) = y(2) + y(6) = 0 + 1 = 1\n*   z(3) = y(3) + y(7) = -3/4 + 1/4 = -1/2\n\nThe resulting 4-point sequence is **z(n) = [0, 1/2, 1, -1/2]**.\n\nNow, we compute the 4-point DFT of `z(n)`, denoted as `Z(k)`:\n`Z(k) = Σ[n=0 to 3] z(n) * exp(-j * 2 * π * k * n / 4)`\n\n*   Z(0) = 0 + 1/2 + 1 - 1/2 = 1\n*   Z(1) = 0 + (1/2)(-j) + 1(-1) + (-1/2)(j) = -1 - j\n*   Z(2) = 0 + (1/2)(-1) + 1(1) + (-1/2)(-1) = 1\n*   Z(3) = 0 + (1/2)(j) + 1(-1) + (-1/2)(-j) = -1 + j\n\nAlternatively, a property of the DFT states that the DFT of the time-aliased sequence `z(n)` can be obtained by taking the even-indexed samples of the 8-point DFT of `y(n)`. The 8-point DFT `Y(k)` can be related to `X(k)` and `H(k)` by the formulas for the DFT of interleaved sequences:\n*   Y(k) = X(k) + W_8^k * H(k)\n*   Y(k+4) = X(k) - W_8^k * H(k)\nwhere W_8 = exp(-j2π/8).\n\nThe desired 4-point DFT `Z(k)` is equal to `Y(2k)` for k=0,1,2,3.\n*   Z(0) = Y(0) = X(0) + W_8^0*H(0) = 1 + 1*0 = 1\n*   Z(1) = Y(2) = X(2) + W_8^2*H(2) = -1 + (-j)*1 = -1 - j\n*   Z(2) = Y(4) = X(0) - W_8^0*H(0) = 1 - 1*0 = 1\n*   Z(3) = Y(6) = X(2) - W_8^2*H(2) = -1 - (-j)*1 = -1 + j\n\nBoth methods yield the same result.\n\nThe 4-point DFT for the sequence {x(0),h(0),x(1),h(1),x(2),h(2),x(3),h(3)} is:\n**[1, -1-j, 1, -1+j]**\n\n<<<[1, -1-j, 1, -1+j]>>>"
