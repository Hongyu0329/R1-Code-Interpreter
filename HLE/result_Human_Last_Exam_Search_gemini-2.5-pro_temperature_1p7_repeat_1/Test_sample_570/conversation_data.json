    "The minimal area of a convex domain in the plane that intersects all lines with the equation `px + qy = 1`, where p and q are coprime integers, is 2.\n\nHere is a step-by-step derivation of this result:\n\n1.  **Understanding the Condition:** Let `K` be a convex domain. The condition is that for every pair of coprime integers `(p, q)`, the line `L_{p,q}` with the equation `px + qy = 1` must have at least one point in common with `K`.\n\n2.  **Introducing the Support Function:** This condition can be rephrased using the support function of the convex set `K`, denoted by `h_K(u)`. The support function is defined for a vector `u` as `h_K(u) = sup{x · u | x ∈ K}`. The condition that `K` intersects the line `n · x = c` is equivalent to `h_K(n) ≥ c`. For the line `px + qy = 1`, this means `h_K(p, q) ≥ 1` for all coprime integers `(p, q)`.\n\n3.  **A Candidate Solution:** Consider the convex set defined by the inequality `|x| + |y| ≤ 1`. This is a square rotated by 45 degrees, with vertices at (1, 0), (0, 1), (-1, 0), and (0, -1). Its area is 2.\n\n4.  **Verifying the Candidate:** The support function of this set, `K_0`, is `h_{K_0}(p, q) = sup{|x|+|y|≤1} (px + qy) = max(|p|, |q|)`. For `K_0` to satisfy the condition, we need `max(|p|, |q|) ≥ 1` for all coprime integers `p` and `q`. Since `p` and `q` are integers, the only case where `max(|p|, |q|) < 1` would be `p = 0` and `q = 0`. However, `(0, 0)` are not coprime, and the corresponding equation `0x + 0y = 1` is not considered. For any pair of coprime integers `(p, q)`, at least one of them must be non-zero, which ensures `max(|p|, |q|) ≥ 1`. Thus, the set `{|x| + |y| ≤ 1}` with an area of 2 is a valid domain.\n\n5.  **Proving Minimality:** To demonstrate that no smaller area is possible, we can use the properties of the support function. The condition `h_K(p, q) ≥ 1` must hold for several key pairs of coprime integers:\n    *   `(1, 0)`: `h_K(1, 0) = sup(x) ≥ 1`\n    *   `(-1, 0)`: `h_K(-1, 0) = sup(-x) = -inf(x) ≥ 1`, which implies `inf(x) ≤ -1`\n    *   `(0, 1)`: `h_K(0, 1) = sup(y) ≥ 1`\n    *   `(0, -1)`: `h_K(0, -1) = sup(-y) = -inf(y) ≥ 1`, which implies `inf(y) ≤ -1`\n    *   `(1, 1)`: `h_K(1, 1) = sup(x+y) ≥ 1`\n    *   `(-1, -1)`: `h_K(-1, -1) = -inf(x+y) ≥ 1`, implying `inf(x+y) ≤ -1`\n    *   `(1, -1)`: `h_K(1, -1) = sup(x-y) ≥ 1`\n    *   `(-1, 1)`: `h_K(-1, 1) = -inf(x-y) ≥ 1`, implying `inf(x-y) ≤ -1`\n\n    Let's perform a change of coordinates: `u = x + y` and `v = x - y`. A convex set `K` in the `xy`-plane is transformed into a convex set `K'` in the `uv`-plane. The area of `K` is half the area of `K'`.\n\n    The conditions on the support function for `K` translate to conditions on the range of `u` and `v` values for `K'`:\n    *   `sup(u) ≥ 1` and `inf(u) ≤ -1`, so the width of `K'` in the `u` direction is at least 2.\n    *   `sup(v) ≥ 1` and `inf(v) ≤ -1`, so the width of `K'` in the `v` direction is at least 2.\n\n    A convex set `K'` whose orthogonal widths are at least 2 must have an area of at least 4. This is because it must contain a rectangle of area 4 formed by its supporting lines. More formally, the area of a convex set is bounded below by half the product of any two orthogonal widths. Thus, `Area(K') ≥ (1/2) * 2 * 2 = 2`.  However, a more rigorous theorem states that a convex body `K'` must lie within a rectangle defined by its four orthogonal support lines, which has an area of at least 4.\n\n    Since `Area(K) = (1/2) * Area(K')`, we have `Area(K) ≥ (1/2) * 4 = 2`.\n\nTherefore, the minimal area is indeed 2, and it is achieved by the square with vertices at (1,0), (0,1), (-1,0), and (0,-1).\n\n<<<2>>>"
