    "The curve described by the parametric equations x(t) = cos(9t) and y(t) = sin(5t) is a Lissajous curve. To find the number of self-intersection points, we can use a known formula for Lissajous curves.\n\nThe general form of a Lissajous curve is given by x(t) = A sin(at + δ) and y(t) = B sin(bt). In this case, we have x(t) = cos(9t) = sin(9t + π/2) and y(t) = sin(5t). Thus, we have a = 9 and b = 5.\n\nFor Lissajous curves where 'a' and 'b' are coprime integers, the number of self-intersection points depends on whether 'a' and 'b' are odd or even.\n\nIn this specific case, a = 9 and b = 5 are both odd and coprime (their greatest common divisor is 1). The formula for the number of self-intersection points when both 'a' and 'b' are odd and coprime is given by:\n\nNumber of self-intersections = (a - 1)(b - 1) / 2\n\nSubstituting the values of a = 9 and b = 5 into the formula:\n\nNumber of self-intersections = (9 - 1)(5 - 1) / 2\nNumber of self-intersections = (8)(4) / 2\nNumber of self-intersections = 32 / 2\nNumber of self-intersections = 16\n\nTherefore, the curve has 16 self-intersection points.\n\n<<<16>>>"
