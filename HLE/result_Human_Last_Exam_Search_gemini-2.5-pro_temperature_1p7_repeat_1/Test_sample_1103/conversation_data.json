    "In the context of the Gauss class number problem, there are 236 negative fundamental discriminants that have a class number of 48. This result is based on the comprehensive work by Mark Watkins, who successfully determined all imaginary quadratic fields for class numbers up to 100.\n\nThe Gauss class number problem, in its essence, seeks to classify all imaginary quadratic fields for a given class number. Watkins' paper, \"Class numbers of imaginary quadratic fields,\" is a pivotal publication that provides a complete list of these fields up to class number 100, making it the authoritative source for this information. The problem was solved through extensive computational efforts building on the theoretical work of Goldfeld, Gross, and Zagier.\n\nIt's interesting to note that while for any given class number there is a finite number of corresponding imaginary quadratic fields, the problem of determining this exact number for larger class numbers remains a significant computational challenge.\n\n<<<236>>>"
