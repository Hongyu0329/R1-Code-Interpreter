    "To determine the separatrix of the given system of differential equations, we first analyze its equilibrium points and their stability. A separatrix is a curve in the phase plane that divides trajectories with different long-term behaviors. Such curves are often the stable or unstable manifolds of saddle points.\n\nThe system of differential equations is:\n$$d'(t)=2d^2(t)+(-3u(t)+5u^2(t))d(t)-u(t)(1-u(t))u^2(t)$$\n$$u'(t)=(u(t)-1)u^2(t)$$\n\nWe are interested in the phase plane for $u \\geq 0$.\n\n### **1. Equilibrium Points**\n\nEquilibrium points are found by setting $d'(t) = 0$ and $u'(t) = 0$.\nFrom $u'(t) = (u-1)u^2 = 0$, we get $u=0$ or $u=1$.\n\n*   **Case 1: u = 0**\n    Substituting into the equation for $d'$, we get $2d^2 = 0$, which implies $d=0$. This gives the equilibrium point **(0, 0)**.\n\n*   **Case 2: u = 1**\n    Substituting into the equation for $d'$, we get $2d^2 + (-3+5)d - 0 = 0$, so $2d^2+2d=0$, which yields $2d(d+1)=0$. This gives $d=0$ or $d=-1$. We find two more equilibrium points: **(1, 0)** and **(1, -1)**.\n\n### **2. Stability Analysis**\n\nTo classify these points, we compute the Jacobian matrix of the system, $J(u, d) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial u} & \\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial d} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial d'}{\\partial u} & \\frac{\\partial d'}{\\partial d} \\end{pmatrix}$:\n$$J(u,d) = \\begin{pmatrix} 3u^2-2u & 0 \\\\ (-3+10u)d-3u^2+4u^3 & 4d-3u+5u^2 \\end{pmatrix}$$\nThe eigenvalues are the diagonal entries: $\\lambda_1 = 3u^2-2u$ and $\\lambda_2 = 4d-3u+5u^2$.\n\n*   At **(0, 0)**: $\\lambda_1 = 0, \\lambda_2 = 0$. This is a non-hyperbolic equilibrium point, and linear analysis is inconclusive.\n*   At **(1, 0)**: $\\lambda_1 = 1, \\lambda_2 = 2$. Both eigenvalues are positive, so this is an **unstable node** (a source).\n*   At **(1, -1)**: $\\lambda_1 = 1, \\lambda_2 = -2$. The eigenvalues have opposite signs, so this is a **saddle point**.\n\n### **3. Identifying the Separatrix**\n\nSeparatrices are typically associated with the stable or unstable manifolds of saddle points. In this case, the saddle point is at (1, -1). The unstable manifold of this saddle point is a key candidate for the separatrix.\n\nWe can find an exact equation for the trajectories in the $(u,d)$ phase plane by considering the slope $\\frac{dd}{du}$:\n$$\\frac{dd}{du} = \\frac{d'}{u'} = \\frac{2d^2 + (5u^2-3u)d - u^3+u^4}{u^2(u-1)}$$\nWe test if a simple function could be a solution to this equation. Let's try the parabolic curve $d = -u^2$.\n\n*   The curve passes through the saddle point (1, -1), since $-1^2 = -1$.\n*   The slope of the curve is $\\frac{dd}{du} = -2u$.\n*   Substituting $d=-u^2$ into the right-hand side of the trajectory equation gives:\n    $$\\frac{2(-u^2)^2 + (5u^2-3u)(-u^2) - u^3+u^4}{u^3-u^2} = \\frac{2u^4 - 5u^4 + 3u^3 - u^3 + u^4}{u^3-u^2} = \\frac{-2u^4+2u^3}{u^3-u^2} = \\frac{-2u^3(u-1)}{u^2(u-1)}=-2u$$\nSince both sides of the equation are equal to $-2u$, the curve $d(u) = -u^2$ is an exact trajectory of the system.\n\nThis curve is an invariant manifold, meaning trajectories cannot cross it. For $0 \\leq u < 1$, the trajectory along this curve connects the saddle point (1, -1) to the equilibrium point (0, 0), representing a heteroclinic orbit. Such a curve separates the phase plane into regions of qualitatively different behavior. Trajectories starting on one side of this curve will have a different fate than those starting on the other side. Therefore, this curve is the separatrix.\n\nThe separatrix for the given system is the curve defined by the equation:\n$$d = -u^2$$\n\n<<<The separatrix is given by the equation $d(u) = -u^2$.>>>"
