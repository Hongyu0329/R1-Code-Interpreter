    "I have been unable to identify a specific philosopher from the Lviv-Warsaw School who decomposes the notion of a hallmark into symptoms and signals based on the conducted searches.\n\nMy investigation, which included searching in both English and Polish, confirmed that the key concepts are part of the semiotic and epistemological discussions within the school's sphere of influence. A significant finding was a reference in the philosophical journal \"Ruch Filozoficzny\" to a classification of signs that includes \"Oznaka, wskaźnik, symptom, znak ikoniczny, sygnał, symbol\" (which translates to \"Mark/Sign, indicator, symptom, iconic sign, signal, symbol\"). This indicates that a detailed analysis of signs was undertaken by philosophers associated with the school.\n\nFurthermore, an index of philosophical topics lists \"symptom / oznaka / wskaźnik\" (symptom / mark / indicator) and \"sygnał\" (signal) as relevant concepts, and a Polish-English glossary from a book on the school also includes these terms.\n\nDespite these indications that the concepts were a subject of study, I was unable to locate a primary or secondary source that explicitly attributes the specific decomposition of \"hallmark\" (or a directly equivalent term like *oznaka*) into \"symptoms\" and \"signals\" to a single philosopher such as Kazimierz Twardowski, Tadeusz Czeżowski, or Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz.\n\nTherefore, without a definitive source, I cannot name the philosopher who made this specific conceptual distinction."
