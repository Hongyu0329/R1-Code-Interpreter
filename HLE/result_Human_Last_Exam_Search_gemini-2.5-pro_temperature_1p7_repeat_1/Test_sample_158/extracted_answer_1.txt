**Required Permeability:**

The required relative permeability of the magnetic material in the shell is given by two possible solutions:

`μ_r = -(R₂ + R₁) / (R₂ - R₁) `
or
`μ_r = -(R₂ - R₁) / (R₂ + R₁)`

This corresponds to an absolute permeability of:
`μ = -μ_0 * (R₂ + R₁) / (R₂ - R₁)` or `μ = -μ_0 * (R₂ - R₁) / (R₂ + R₁)`

**Interior Magnetic Field:**

For the first permeability solution, the magnetic field in the interior region (ρ < R₁) is uniform and given by:

`H_int​ = -H₀ * (R₂/R₁) * x̂`

For the second permeability solution, the internal field is:

`H_int​ = -H₀ * (R₁/R₂) * x̂`
