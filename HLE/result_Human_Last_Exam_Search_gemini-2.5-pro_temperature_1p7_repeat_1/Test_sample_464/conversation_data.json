    "Yes, it follows that $f = 0$. Here is a step-by-step justification.\n\nLet $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ be a Schwartz class function. The key property of a Schwartz function is that the function and all of its derivatives decay faster than any polynomial function as $|x| \\to \\infty$. The condition given is that all its moments are zero for $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$ (non-negative integers $k=0, 1, 2, ...$):\n$$ \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x^k f(x) \\,dx = 0 \\quad \\text{for all } k = 0, 1, 2, \\ldots $$\n\nWe will analyze this condition using the Fourier transform. The Fourier transform of a function $f(x)$ is defined as:\n$$ \\hat{f}(\\xi) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(x) e^{-2\\pi i x \\xi} \\,dx $$\n\nA fundamental property is that the Fourier transform of a Schwartz function is also a Schwartz function.\n\nLet's consider the derivatives of the Fourier transform $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$. Differentiating under the integral sign (which is permissible for Schwartz functions), we get the $k$-th derivative:\n$$ \\hat{f}^{(k)}(\\xi) = \\frac{d^k}{d\\xi^k} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(x) e^{-2\\pi i x \\xi} \\,dx = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(x) (-2\\pi i x)^k e^{-2\\pi i x \\xi} \\,dx $$\n\nEvaluating these derivatives at $\\xi = 0$:\n$$ \\hat{f}^{(k)}(0) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(x) (-2\\pi i x)^k \\,dx = (-2\\pi i)^k \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x^k f(x) \\,dx $$\n\nFrom the given condition, we have $\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x^k f(x) \\,dx = 0$ for all $k \\geq 0$. This directly implies that:\n$$ \\hat{f}^{(k)}(0) = 0 \\quad \\text{for all } k = 0, 1, 2, \\ldots $$\n\nThis means that the Fourier transform $\\hat{f}$ and all of its derivatives are zero at the origin.\n\nFurthermore, the Fourier transform of a Schwartz function can be extended to an entire function (a function that is analytic over the whole complex plane). This is because the rapid decay of $f(x)$ ensures that the integral for $\\hat{f}(z)$ converges for any complex number $z$.\n\nSince $\\hat{f}(z)$ is an entire function and all its derivatives at $z=0$ are zero, its Taylor series expansion around the origin is identically zero. Because an entire function is equal to its Taylor series representation everywhere in the complex plane, it must be that $\\hat{f}(z) = 0$ for all $z \\in \\mathbb{C}$.\n\nTherefore, $\\hat{f}(\\xi) = 0$ for all real numbers $\\xi$.\n\nThe Fourier transform is an invertible linear operator on the space of Schwartz functions. This means that if $\\hat{f} = 0$, then $f$ must also be zero. This can be seen from the inverse Fourier transform:\n$$ f(x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\hat{f}(\\xi) e^{2\\pi i x \\xi} \\,d\\xi $$\nIf $\\hat{f}(\\xi) = 0$ for all $\\xi$, the integral is zero, so $f(x) = 0$ for all $x$.\n\nThis completes the proof that if a Schwartz function has all its moments equal to zero, it must be the zero function.\n\nNote: The result also holds if the condition applies only for $k \\in \\{1, 2, 3, \\ldots\\}$. In that case, we would have $\\hat{f}^{(k)}(0)=0$ for $k \\geq 1$. This would imply that $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$ is a constant function. As a Schwartz function, $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$ must approach zero as $|\\xi| \\to \\infty$. The only constant function with this property is the zero function, so $\\hat{f}(\\xi)=0$, which again leads to $f=0$.\n\n<<<Yes, it follows that f = 0.>>>"
