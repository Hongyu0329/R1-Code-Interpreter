    "The search results confirm the initial reasoning.\n\nA \"clique\" in a graph is a subset of vertices where every two distinct vertices are adjacent, meaning the induced subgraph is a complete graph. The question asks for the maximum number of different sizes of such cliques that can exist as induced subgraphs in a single graph with 128 vertices.\n\nLet G be a graph on n = 128 vertices. The size of a clique is the number of vertices in it. If a graph G contains a clique of size k, then any subset of these k vertices of size j (where 1 ≤ j ≤ k) also forms a clique. This means that if G has an induced subgraph isomorphic to the complete graph K_k, it also has induced subgraphs isomorphic to K_j for all 1 ≤ j ≤ k.\n\nTherefore, the set of all possible clique sizes that can appear as induced subgraphs in any given graph G is of the form {1, 2, ..., ω(G)}, where ω(G) is the *clique number* of G—the size of the largest clique in the graph. The number of different clique sizes is consequently equal to ω(G).\n\nThe problem is now reduced to finding the maximum possible clique number for a graph with 128 vertices. For any graph with n vertices, the clique number can be at most n. This maximum is achieved by the complete graph K_n, which is a graph where every vertex is connected to every other vertex.\n\nFor n = 128, the complete graph K_128 has a clique number of 128. In K_128, any subset of k vertices forms a clique of size k. Consequently, K_128 has induced subgraphs of all possible clique sizes from 1 to 128. The set of clique sizes is {1, 2, 3, ..., 128}, and the number of different sizes is 128.\n\nNo other graph on 128 vertices can have a clique number greater than 128. Therefore, no graph can have more than 128 different clique sizes.\n\nIt is important not to confuse this with the number of *maximal* cliques, which is a different, more complex problem. The question is specifically about the number of different *sizes* of cliques.\n\n<<<128>>>"
