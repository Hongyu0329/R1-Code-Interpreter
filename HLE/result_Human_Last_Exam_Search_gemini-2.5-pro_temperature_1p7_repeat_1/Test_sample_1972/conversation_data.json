    "Jorge Luis Borges was referring to the novel **\"El sueño de los héroes\"** by the Argentine writer **Adolfo Bioy Casares**.\n\nIn the prologue he wrote for Bioy Casares's novel, Borges stated: \"In these pages, so pathetic and, at the same time, so funny, so secret and so urban, Bioy Casares has applied a procedure whose invention I would not be surprised if he were the first: to infuse a story, which could have the banality of a police report, with the intensity of a tiger and the variety that a chess duel can achieve.\"\n\nRegarding the second part of the user's question, the description of an author as a \"continuator (and simplifier) of Faulkner\" is a separate comment Borges made about the Uruguayan writer **Juan Carlos Onetti**. While Borges admired both authors, the two quotes refer to different writers.\n\n<<<\"El sueño de los héroes\" by Adolfo Bioy Casares>>>"
