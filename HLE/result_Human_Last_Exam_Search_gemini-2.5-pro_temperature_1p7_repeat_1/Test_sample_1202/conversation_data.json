    "After a gene duplication event, there are several possible fates for the newly created duplicate gene. The most common outcome is the loss of function through mutation, a process known as **pseudogenization (B)**. In this scenario, one gene copy becomes a nonfunctional DNA segment because the functional redundancy makes its preservation unnecessary for the organism's survival. Therefore, pseudogenization is a mechanism of gene loss, not retention of functional, divergent genes.\n\n**Gene conversion (A)** is a process of non-reciprocal DNA transfer that makes two homologous sequences identical. While it influences the evolution of duplicated genes, its primary effect is homogenization, which opposes sequence divergence. It is not the primary mechanism driving the divergence of functions.\n\n**Adaptive radiation (E)** is a macroevolutionary process where a single ancestral species diversifies into multiple new species, each adapted to a different ecological niche. While gene duplication can provide the genetic raw material that fuels adaptive radiation, it is a species-level phenomenon, not a direct mechanism for the retention and divergence of individual genes within a genome.\n\nThe two main mechanisms responsible for the long-term preservation and functional divergence of duplicate genes are **neofunctionalization (C)** and **subfunctionalization (D)**.\n\n**Neofunctionalization** occurs when one copy of the duplicated gene retains the original ancestral function, while the other copy accumulates mutations that give it a completely new, beneficial function. The evolution of this new function provides a selective advantage, ensuring the retention of both gene copies and leading to their functional divergence.\n\n**Subfunctionalization** proposes that an ancestral gene had multiple functions or complex expression patterns. After duplication, degenerative mutations can occur in different subfunctions of each copy. As a result, both copies become specialized in a subset of the original ancestral functions, and both are required to fully perform the original role. This \"division of labor\" ensures that both copies are preserved from being lost. This process, often described by the Duplication-Degeneration-Complementation (DDC) model, is considered a highly plausible and potentially more common neutral pathway for preserving duplicate genes immediately following duplication.\n\nBoth neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization are critical for the retention and divergence of duplicate genes. However, subfunctionalization provides a compelling model for preserving a large number of duplicates because it can occur through the accumulation of neutral or near-neutral mutations, which are more common than the rare beneficial mutations required for neofunctionalization. Some evidence even suggests that subfunctionalization may act as a transitional state that protects a duplicated gene from being lost, allowing it the time to potentially evolve a new function later on (neofunctionalization). Given that it provides a more widespread and immediate pathway to preventing the loss of the duplicate, subfunctionalization is considered a highly likely and fundamental mechanism for duplicate gene retention and divergence.\n\n<<<D>>>"
