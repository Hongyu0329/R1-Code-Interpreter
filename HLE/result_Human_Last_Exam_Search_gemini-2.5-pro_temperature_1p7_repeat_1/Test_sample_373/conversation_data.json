    "In a barbell graph with 10 nodes, the probability of sampling the bottleneck edge during randomized uniform gossiping is 1/21.\n\nHere is the breakdown of the calculation:\n\n*   **Graph Structure**: A standard 10-node barbell graph is constructed by connecting two complete graphs (cliques) of 5 nodes each with a single edge. This connecting edge is known as the bottleneck or bridge.\n*   **Counting the Edges**:\n    *   A complete graph with 'n' nodes has n * (n-1) / 2 edges.\n    *   For one of the 5-node cliques (a K5 graph), the number of edges is 5 * (5-1) / 2 = 10.\n    *   Since the barbell graph has two such cliques, they contribute a total of 10 + 10 = 20 edges.\n    *   In addition to the clique edges, there is the single bottleneck edge connecting the two cliques.\n    *   Therefore, the total number of edges in the graph is 20 + 1 = 21.\n*   **Randomized Uniform Gossiping**: In the context of network analysis, randomized uniform gossiping often refers to a process where, at each step, an edge is selected uniformly at random from the set of all edges in the graph.\n*   **Calculating the Probability**:\n    *   There is only one bottleneck edge in the graph.\n    *   The total number of edges is 21.\n    *   The probability of selecting any single edge, including the bottleneck, is the number of desired edges divided by the total number of edges.\n    *   Probability = 1 / 21.\n\nThis low probability of sampling the bottleneck edge is a key reason why information spreads slowly in barbell graphs under uniform gossip protocols.\n\n<<<1/21>>>"
