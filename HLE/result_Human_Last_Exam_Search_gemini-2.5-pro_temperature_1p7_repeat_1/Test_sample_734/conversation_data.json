    "The Christian theologian who first developed specialized terminology to describe changes in the laws of nature, applicable to both the virgin birth of Jesus and the possible alterations in natural laws at the Fall, was **Augustine of Hippo**.\n\nAugustine, a pivotal figure in early Christian thought, developed the concept of \"seminal reasons\" (in Latin, *rationes seminales*) to explain events that appear to be outside the normal course of nature. He argued that miracles are not violations of natural law, but rather the actualization of hidden potentialities that God embedded in creation from the very beginning. In his view, what we perceive as a miracle is not \"contrary to nature, but contrary to what we know as nature.\"\n\nThis theological framework allowed Augustine to address key Christian doctrines:\n\n*   **The Fall of Man:** Augustine posited that all of humanity was \"seminally present in the loins of Adam.\" Therefore, when Adam and Eve sinned, the \"seminal nature\" from which all humans were to be propagated became \"vitiated through sin.\" This explains a fundamental change in the state of human nature and its relationship with the natural world, as the consequences of this first sin, including a corrupted nature and death, were passed down through ordinary generation.\n\n*   **The Virgin Birth:** Augustine viewed the virgin birth of Jesus as a \"notable miracle\" and an exceptional case where the standard laws of human procreation, which he believed transmitted original sin, were bypassed. This event, for Augustine, demonstrated God's power to act in a novel way, not by breaking his own natural laws, but by bringing forth a new reality from the potentialities he had created. The birth of Christ from a virgin was a divine intervention that introduced a sinless human nature into the world, a \"new stream\" not subject to the corruption inherited from Adam.\n\nBy employing the terminology of \"seminal reasons,\" Augustine was able to theologically articulate how the laws of nature could be altered or superseded by God's will in specific instances like the virgin birth and how they were fundamentally changed in their effect on humanity after the Fall.\n\n<<<Augustine of Hippo>>>"
