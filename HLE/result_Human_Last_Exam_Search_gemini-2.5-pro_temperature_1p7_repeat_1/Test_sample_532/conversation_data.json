    "A finite group *G* is termed a \"filled group\" if all of its maximal by inclusion product-free sets fill *G*. A set *S* is product-free if for any elements *a* and *b* in *S*, their product *ab* is not in *S*. A product-free set *S* fills *G* if every non-identity element of *G* is either in *S* or can be expressed as a product of two elements from *S*.\n\nThe classification of finite filled nilpotent groups has been established through the work of several mathematicians, notably C. S. Anabanti, S. B. Hart, and G. Erskine. A finite nilpotent group is a filled group if and only if it is one of the following: a cyclic group of order 3 or 5, or a 2-group of a specific type.\n\nThe finite filled nilpotent groups fall into the following categories:\n\n*   **Cyclic Groups:** The only filled cyclic groups (which are inherently abelian and therefore nilpotent) of odd order are C₃ and C₅.\n*   **Abelian 2-Groups:** The filled abelian 2-groups are the elementary abelian 2-groups, which are groups of the form (C₂)ⁿ for some integer n ≥ 1.\n*   **Non-Abelian 2-Groups:** The classification of non-abelian filled 2-groups has also been completed. The groups that fall under this category are:\n    *   The dihedral group of order 8, denoted as D₈.\n    *   The direct product of the dihedral group of order 8 and a cyclic group of order 2, denoted as D₈ × C₂.\n    *   The central product of the dihedral group of order 8 and the quaternion group of order 8, denoted as D₈ ∗ Q₈.\n    *   The direct product of the central product D₈ ∗ Q₈ and a cyclic group of order 2, denoted as (D₈ ∗ Q₈) × C₂.\n\nIn summary, a finite group *G* is a filled nilpotent group if and only if it is one of C₃, C₅, an elementary abelian 2-group, D₈, D₈ × C₂, D₈ ∗ Q₈, or (D₈ ∗ Q₈) × C₂.\n\n<<<The finite filled nilpotent groups are the cyclic groups C₃ and C₅, the elementary abelian 2-groups, the dihedral group of order 8 (D₈), the direct product D₈ × C₂, the central product D₈ ∗ Q₈, and the direct product (D₈ ∗ Q₈) × C₂.>>>"
