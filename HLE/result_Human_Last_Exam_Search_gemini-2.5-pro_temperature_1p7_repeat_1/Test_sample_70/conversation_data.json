    "When represented as matrices with their rank maximized, three African nations have flags with the same linear algebraic rank as the flag of Denmark. The Danish flag's iconic Nordic cross design gives it a rank of 2. The African flags sharing this characteristic are those of **Benin, Madagascar, and Nigeria**.\n\nThe rank of a matrix is the maximum number of linearly independent rows or columns. For a flag, this translates to the complexity of its geometric pattern. Assuming different colors are represented by distinct, non-zero numbers, the rank is determined by the number of unique ways rows and columns are colored.\n\nThe flag of Denmark, with its white cross on a red field, results in a matrix where the columns (or rows) are of two distinct types: those that are entirely red (or white, for the horizontal bar) and those that are a mix of red and white. These two types of vectors are linearly independent, thus giving the matrix a rank of 2.\n\nThe three African flags that also have a rank of 2 are:\n*   **Nigeria:** The flag of Nigeria consists of three vertical stripes, with green on the outer bands and white in the center. When viewed as a matrix, all green columns are identical, and all white columns are identical. This creates a matrix with only two types of linearly independent column vectors, resulting in a rank of 2.\n\n*   **Benin:** The flag of Benin has a green vertical band at the hoist, with two horizontal bands of yellow and red on the fly side. In its matrix form, there are two types of columns: those in the green section and those in the yellow and red section. These two column types are linearly independent, which gives the flag a rank of 2.\n\n*   **Madagascar:** Similar to Benin, the flag of Madagascar features a white vertical band at the hoist and two horizontal bands of red and green. The structure is analogous to that of Benin's flag, producing a matrix with two linearly independent column types: the white columns and the red-and-green columns. This results in a rank of 2.\n\nOther African flags have higher ranks due to more complex designs, such as having three or more colored stripes without any overlap, or the inclusion of emblems, stars, triangles, and other complex patterns which add more linearly independent rows and columns.\n\n<<<Benin, Madagascar, and Nigeria>>>"
