    "The sequence presented, 3 2 1 2 3 3 3 2 2, can be understood by relating the numbers to the keys on a standard telephone keypad. The pattern is formed by \"drawing\" the number 5 on the keypad.\n\nIf you visualize a phone keypad, the sequence of numbers corresponds to the keys pressed to trace the outline of the number \"5\":\n*   Starting at the top left of the \"5\", you press **3**.\n*   Moving down, you press **2**.\n*   Then across the bottom, you press **1**, **2**, and **3**.\n*   Moving up the right side, you press **3** and **3** again.\n*   Going across the top, you press **2** and **2**.\n\nTo complete the next four elements of the sequence, you would continue tracing the shape of the \"5\":\n*   Moving down the left side completes the shape, which requires pressing **2**, **1**, **1**, and **1**.\n\nTherefore, the next four numbers in the sequence are 2, 1, 1, 1.\n\n<<<A>>>"
