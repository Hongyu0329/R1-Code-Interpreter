    "I am unable to find the specific assertion by Paul Morand that Fernand Braudel is said to have quoted regarding a conceptual entity, exemplified by the symbol of a nation, being inscribed within a sphere. My research has confirmed that Fernand Braudel was familiar with the work of Paul Morand, as evidenced by references in his writings, particularly within his extensive work *Civilization and Capitalism*. However, the precise quotation mentioned in your query could not be located in the available search results.\n\nScholarly analyses of Braudel's work often discuss his use of spatial metaphors and his concept of the *longue dur√©e*, a long-term historical perspective. These analyses also touch upon his \"world-systems\" theory, which considers the interconnectedness of global economies and civilizations. It is possible that the idea of a nation being \"inscribed within a sphere\" relates to these broader Braudelian themes of contained worlds or economic zones of influence.\n\nDespite multiple search strategies, the direct quotation and the specific name of the conceptual entity remain elusive. It is possible the reference is located in a less-accessible work of Braudel or that the phrasing is a paraphrase of Morand's idea rather than a direct quote. Without the primary source or a direct scholarly citation, I cannot definitively identify the conceptual entity to which you refer.\n\n<<<I am unable to answer this question.>>>"
