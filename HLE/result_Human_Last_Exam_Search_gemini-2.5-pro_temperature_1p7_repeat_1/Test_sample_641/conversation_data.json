    "The number of involutions in the projective special unitary group PSU(4, 997) is given by the formula `q^5 * (q+1)^3 * (q^2 - q + 1)` where `q = 997`.\n\nThis result is derived by identifying the conjugacy classes of involutions within the group and summing their sizes. The involutions in PSU(4, 997) arise from elements in the special unitary group SU(4, 997) whose square is in the center of SU(4, 997). This leads to two distinct types of involutions in PSU(4, 997).\n\nThe calculation for the number of these involutions proceeds as follows:\n*   **Identify classes of involutions:** The involutions in PSU(4, 997) come from two sources in SU(4, 997):\n    1.  Elements `t` such that `t^2 = I` (where `I` is the identity matrix). These are involutions in SU(4, 997), and for their determinant to be 1, the dimension of their (-1)-eigenspace must be even. In SU(4, 997), this leads to one relevant class of involutions.\n    2.  Elements `t` such that `t^2 = -I`. These elements, when projected into PSU(4, 997), become involutions. This gives rise to a second class of involutions.\n\n*   **Calculate the size of each class:** The size of each conjugacy class is determined by the order of the group divided by the order of the centralizer of an element in that class.\n    *   The size of the first class is `q^4 * (q+1)^2 * (q^2 - q + 1) * (q^2 + 1)`.\n    *   The size of the second class is `q^4 * (q-1) * (q+1)^2 * (q^2 - q + 1)`.\n\n*   **Sum the sizes:** The total number of involutions is the sum of the sizes of these two classes.\n\nSubstituting `q = 997`, the number of involutions is:\n\n`997^5 * (997+1)^3 * (997^2 - 997 + 1) = 997^5 * 998^3 * (994009 - 997 + 1) = 997^5 * 998^3 * 993013`\n\nThis evaluates to a very large number, approximately 9.8 x 10<sup>30</sup>.\n\n<<<997^5 * 998^3 * 993013>>>"
