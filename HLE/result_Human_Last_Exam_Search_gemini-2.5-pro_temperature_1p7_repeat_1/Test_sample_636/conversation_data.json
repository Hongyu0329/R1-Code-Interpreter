    "To solve this problem, we need to find a state feedback gain matrix `F` such that the eigenvalues of the closed-loop system matrix `A + BF` are at the specified locations `-1 + j` and `-1 - j`.\n\nGiven the matrices:\n`A = [[-1, 1], [1, 0]]`\n`B = [[1, 2], [1, 0]]`\n\n**1. Determine the Desired Characteristic Polynomial**\n\nThe desired eigenvalues are a complex conjugate pair: `-1 + j` and `-1 - j`. The characteristic polynomial corresponding to these eigenvalues is:\n`p(λ) = (λ - (-1 + j))(λ - (-1 - j))`\n`p(λ) = ((λ + 1) - j)((λ + 1) + j)`\n`p(λ) = (λ + 1)² - j²`\n`p(λ) = λ² + 2λ + 1 + 1`\n`p(λ) = λ² + 2λ + 2`\n\n**2. Check for Controllability**\n\nBefore proceeding, we must verify that the system is controllable. A system is controllable if the controllability matrix `C = [B, AB]` has full rank (rank 2 in this case).\nFirst, we calculate the product `AB`:\n`AB = [[-1, 1], [1, 0]] * [[1, 2], [1, 0]] = [[(-1*1 + 1*1), (-1*2 + 1*0)], [(1*1 + 0*1), (1*2 + 0*0)]] = [[0, -2], [1, 2]]`\nThe controllability matrix is:\n`C = [B, AB] = [[1, 2, 0, -2], [1, 0, 1, 2]]`\nThe rank of this 2x4 matrix is 2, since the first two columns (the matrix B) are linearly independent (`det(B) = 1*0 - 2*1 = -2 ≠ 0`). Since the system is controllable, we can place the closed-loop poles arbitrarily.\n\n**3. Calculate the Closed-Loop System Matrix and its Characteristic Polynomial**\n\nThe state feedback gain matrix `F` will be a 2x2 matrix. Let:\n`F = [[f₁, f₂], [f₃, f₄]]`\n\nThe closed-loop system matrix is `A_cl = A + BF`:\n`BF = [[1, 2], [1, 0]] * [[f₁, f₂], [f₃, f₄]] = [[f₁ + 2f₃, f₂ + 2f₄], [f₁, f₂]]`\n`A + BF = [[-1, 1], [1, 0]] + [[f₁ + 2f₃, f₂ + 2f₄], [f₁, f₂]] = [[-1 + f₁ + 2f₃, 1 + f₂ + 2f₄], [1 + f₁, f₂]]`\n\nSince the system is a multi-input system (B has two columns), there are more unknowns in F (four) than equations provided by the characteristic polynomial coefficients (two). This means there are infinite solutions for `F`. We can simplify the problem by setting some elements of `F` to zero.\n\nA common approach is to use only one input channel, provided the system is controllable through that channel. Let's try to achieve pole placement using only the first input, which means we can set the second row of `F` to zero. This is valid because the system is controllable through the first column of B, `b₁ = [1, 1]ᵀ`.\nLet `F = [[f₁, f₂], [0, 0]]`.\n\nNow, we recompute `A + BF`:\n`BF = [[1, 2], [1, 0]] * [[f₁, f₂], [0, 0]] = [[f₁, f₂], [f₁, f₂]]`\n`A + BF = [[-1, 1], [1, 0]] + [[f₁, f₂], [f₁, f₂]] = [[-1 + f₁, 1 + f₂], [1 + f₁, f₂]]`\n\nThe characteristic polynomial of this closed-loop matrix is `det(λI - (A + BF))`:\n`det([[λ - (-1 + f₁), -(1 + f₂)], [-(1 + f₁), λ - f₂]])`\n`= (λ + 1 - f₁)(λ - f₂) - (1 + f₂)(1 + f₁)`\n`= λ² - f₂λ + λ - f₂ - f₁λ + f₁f₂ - (1 + f₁ + f₂ + f₁f₂)`\n`= λ² + (1 - f₁ - f₂)λ - f₂ + f₁f₂ - 1 - f₁ - f₂ - f₁f₂`\n`= λ² + (1 - f₁ - f₂)λ + (-1 - f₁ - 2f₂)`\n\n**4. Solve for the Feedback Gains**\n\nWe now equate the coefficients of this polynomial with the desired characteristic polynomial `λ² + 2λ + 2`:\n1.  `1 - f₁ - f₂ = 2  => f₁ + f₂ = -1`\n2.  `-1 - f₁ - 2f₂ = 2 => f₁ + 2f₂ = -3`\n\nWe now have a system of two linear equations with two variables. Subtracting the first equation from the second gives:\n`(f₁ + 2f₂) - (f₁ + f₂) = -3 - (-1)`\n`f₂ = -2`\n\nSubstituting `f₂ = -2` into the first equation:\n`f₁ + (-2) = -1`\n`f₁ = 1`\n\nThus, a valid state feedback gain matrix is:\n`F = [[1, -2], [0, 0]]`\n\nTo verify, let's calculate the eigenvalues of `A+BF` with this F:\n`A + BF = [[-1+1, 1-2], [1+1, -2]] = [[0, -1], [2, -2]]`\nThe characteristic equation is `det(λI - (A+BF)) = det([[λ, 1],[-2, λ+2]]) = λ(λ+2) - (1)(-2) = λ² + 2λ + 2`, which is the desired polynomial.\n\n<<<F = [[1, -2],]>>>"
