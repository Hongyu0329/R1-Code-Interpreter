    "The number of different types of stable reduction for curves of genus 2 depends on the classification scheme used. Based on a recent detailed classification, there are 54 distinct combinatorial types.\n\nA detailed classification of the stable marked reduction of hyperelliptic genus 2 curves, particularly in residue characteristic 2, identifies 54 different combinatorial structures. This classification is based on the dual graph of the special fiber of the curve's stable model, including the thicknesses of its double points. These 54 types are categorized based on the structure of the special fiber of the projective line to which the genus 2 curve is a double cover. The main groupings are:\n*   **Cases (A):** 3 subcases where the underlying projective line is smooth.\n*   **Cases (B):** 11 subcases where the projective line has one even double point.\n*   **Cases (C):** 6 subcases with two even double points.\n*   **Cases (D):** 24 subcases with three even double points.\n*   **Cases (E)-(G):** 10 subcases with one odd double point (1, 3, and 6 subcases respectively).\n\nA research paper on this topic conjectures that all 54 of these reduction types are realized over the field of rational numbers, and has found empirical evidence for 53 of them.\n\nA broader and less fine-grained classification describes the stable reduction of a genus 2 curve in terms of the geometric components of the special fiber. This leads to seven main types:\n*   **(I)** The stable reduction is a smooth curve.\n*   **(II)** The stable reduction is an elliptic curve with an ordinary double point.\n*   **(III)** The stable reduction is a projective line with two ordinary double points.\n*   **(IV)** The stable reduction consists of two projective lines intersecting transversally at three points.\n*   **(V)** The stable reduction is the union of two elliptic curves intersecting at one point.\n*   **(VI)** The stable reduction is the union of an elliptic curve and a projective line with a double point, intersecting at one point.\n*   **(VII)** The stable reduction is similar to type VI, but both components are singular.\n\n<<<54>>>"
