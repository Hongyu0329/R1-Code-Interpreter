  "question": "This is a problem in a competitive programming contest.\n\nXenia the beginner mathematician is a third year student at elementary school. She is now learning the addition operation.\n\nThe teacher has written down the sum of multiple numbers. Pupils should calculate the sum. To make the calculation easier, the sum only contains numbers 1, 2, 3 and 4. Still, that isn't enough for Xenia. She is only beginning to count, so she can calculate a sum only if the summands follow in non-decreasing order. For example, she can't calculate sum 1+3+2+1 but she can calculate sums 1+1+2 and 3+4.\n\nYou've got the sum that was written on the board. Rearrange the summans and print the sum in such a way that Xenia can calculate the sum.\n\nInput\nThe first line contains a non-empty string s — the sum Xenia needs to count. String s contains no spaces. It only contains digits and characters \"+\". Besides, string s is a correct sum of numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4. String s is at most 1000 characters long.\n\nOutput\nPrint the new sum that Xenia can count.\n\nTask:\n\nWrite the most memory-efficient C program to solve this problem.

    "Answering this competitive programming problem requires finding a solution that is not only correct but also uses the minimum amount of memory for its variables. The optimal approach is to read the input string one character at a time, count the occurrences of each number ('1', '2', '3', '4'), and then print the new sorted sum without ever storing the entire input string in memory.\n\n### Most Memory-Efficient C Program\n\nThe C program below implements this memory-efficient strategy. It uses `getchar()` to read the input stream character by character, which avoids allocating a large buffer for the string. The data types for variables are carefully chosen to be the smallest possible that can hold the required range of values, minimizing memory usage.\n\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main() {\n    // Use an array to count the occurrences of the numbers '1', '2', '3', and '4'.\n    // The maximum count for any number can be 501 (e.g., a string of length 1000\n    // would have (1000+1)/2 = 500.5 -> 501 numbers).\n    // An 'unsigned short' (range 0-65535) is sufficient to store this count.\n    unsigned short count[4] = {0, 0, 0, 0};\n\n    // 'c' stores the character read from input. It must be an 'int' to hold\n    // the special End-Of-File (EOF) value returned by getchar().\n    int c;\n\n    // Read the input character by character, avoiding storing the whole string.\n    while ((c = getchar()) != '\\n' && c != EOF) {\n        // If the character is a digit from '1' to '4', increment its counter.\n        // The '+' characters are ignored.\n        if (c >= '1' && c <= '4') {\n            count[c - '1']++;\n        }\n    }\n\n    // A flag to ensure '+' is not printed before the very first number.\n    // A 'char' is the most memory-efficient type for a simple boolean flag.\n    char is_first_term = 1;\n\n    // 'i' loops through the number types (1 through 4). Its range is 0-3, so\n    // an 'unsigned char' is the smallest sufficient type.\n    unsigned char i;\n    \n    // 'j' loops to print each number the required number of times. Its maximum\n    // value is 501, so an 'unsigned short' is required.\n    unsigned short j;\n\n    // Construct and print the sorted sum directly to the output.\n    for (i = 0; i < 4; i++) {\n        for (j = 0; j < count[i]; j++) {\n            if (!is_first_term) {\n                putchar('+');\n            }\n            putchar('1' + i);\n            is_first_term = 0;\n        }\n    }\n    putchar('\\n');\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Calculation of Total Memory (m)\n\nThe total memory `m` is the sum of the memory allocated for all variables in the `main` function. The calculation is based on standard data type sizes in C (assuming a typical 32-bit or 64-bit environment as found on competitive programming platforms).\n\n*   **`unsigned short count[4]`**: An array of 4 `unsigned short` integers.\n    *   Memory = `4 * sizeof(unsigned short)` = 4 * 2 bytes = **8 bytes**.\n*   **`int c`**: An `int` to hold the return value of `getchar()`.\n    *   Memory = `sizeof(int)` = **4 bytes**.\n*   **`char is_first_term`**: A `char` used as a boolean flag.\n    *   Memory = `sizeof(char)` = **1 byte**.\n*   **`unsigned char i`**: An `unsigned char` for a loop counter from 0 to 3.\n    *   Memory = `sizeof(unsigned char)` = **1 byte**.\n*   **`unsigned short j`**: An `unsigned short` for a loop counter up to 501.\n    *   Memory = `sizeof(unsigned short)` = **2 bytes**.\n\nThe total memory `m` is the sum of these amounts:\n\n`m = 8 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 16` bytes.\n\n<<<16>>>"
