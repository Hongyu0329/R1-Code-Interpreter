    "The ground state degeneracy (GSD) of the toric code is determined by the topology of the surface on which it is defined. Specifically, it is given by `4^g` for a closed surface of genus `g`. When boundaries or holes are introduced, the GSD is modified and depends on the number and type of these boundaries. The two common types of boundaries are \"smooth\" (also known as electric or e-type) and \"rough\" (magnetic or m-type).\n\nThe problem asks for the GSD of the toric code on a surface with `n` smooth holes and `m` rough holes. Typically, if the underlying surface is not specified, it is assumed to be a sphere (genus `g=0`).\n\nThe number of logical qubits, `k`, determines the GSD, which is `2^k`. The number of logical qubits is related to the number of independent, non-trivial topological cycles (homology) and the boundary conditions.\n\nLet's analyze the number of logical qubits for a sphere (`g=0`) with different boundary configurations.\n\n1.  **Holes of a single type:** For a surface with genus `g` and `b` boundaries of the same type, the number of logical qubits is `k = 2g + b - 1`. For a sphere (`g=0`) with `h` holes of the same type (e.g., `n=h, m=0`), the number of boundaries is `h`. The number of logical qubits is `k = h - 1`. The GSD is therefore `2^(h-1)`.\n    *   For one smooth hole (`n=1, m=0`), `k = 1 - 1 = 0`, so GSD = `2^0 = 1`.\n    *   For two smooth holes (`n=2, m=0`), `k = 2 - 1 = 1`, so GSD = `2^1 = 2`.\n\n2.  **Mixed holes (both types present):** When both smooth (`n > 0`) and rough (`m > 0`) holes are present, the situation is more subtle. The presence of two distinct types of boundaries, where different types of anyonic excitations (`e` or `m`) can condense, affects the algebra of logical operators.\n\n    A logical qubit requires a pair of anticommuting logical operators (`X`, `Z`).\n    *   An `m`-type string connecting two smooth holes can act as a logical `X` operator.\n    *   An `e`-type loop around a smooth hole can act as a logical `Z` operator, as it measures the `m`-charge enclosed.\n    *   Similarly, `e`-type strings between rough holes can act as logical `Z` operators, and `m`-type loops around rough holes can act as logical `X` operators.\n\n    Let's consider the case with `n=1` smooth hole and `m=1` rough hole. We can have an `e`-loop operator around the smooth hole (`Z_e`) and an `m`-loop operator around the rough hole (`X_m`). On a sphere, a loop around one hole can be deformed to not intersect a loop around the other. Therefore, these two operators commute, `[X_m, Z_e] = 0`, and do not form a qubit. This leads to `k=0` logical qubits and a GSD of `2^0 = 1`.\n\n    A known formula for the number of logical qubits `k` on a genus `g` surface with `n` smooth and `m` rough boundaries is:\n    *   `k = 2g + n + m - 1`, if `n=0` or `m=0` (but not both).\n    *   `k = 2g + n + m - 2`, if `n > 0` and `m > 0`.\n\n    For the case of a sphere (`g=0`):\n    *   `k = n + m - 1`, if one boundary type is absent.\n    *   `k = n + m - 2`, if both boundary types are present (`n, m >= 1`).\n\n    The question asks for a single formula. Multiple choice questions in this area often implicitly assume the most general case, which is the presence of both types of boundaries (`n \\ge 1` and `m \\ge 1`). Under this assumption, the number of logical qubits is `k = n + m - 2`.\n\n    The ground space degeneracy is therefore `2^k = 2^(n+m-2)`.\n\n    Let's check this against the options. Option B is `2^(m+n-2)`.\n\n    We can verify this for a few cases where `n, m >= 1`:\n    *   `n=1, m=1`: GSD = `2^(1+1-2) = 2^0 = 1`. This matches our reasoning.\n    *   `n=2, m=1`: GSD = `2^(2+1-2) = 2^1 = 2`.\n    *   `n=2, m=2`: GSD = `2^(2+2-2) = 2^2 = 4`.\n\n    If we do not make this assumption, none of the provided simple formulas are correct for all non-negative `n` and `m`. Given the context of the problem, it's most likely that the general case of mixed boundaries is intended.\n\n<<<B>>>"
