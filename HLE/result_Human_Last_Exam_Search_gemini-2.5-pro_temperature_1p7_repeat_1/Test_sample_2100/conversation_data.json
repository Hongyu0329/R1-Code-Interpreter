    "The man Andrei Voznesensky called a \"joy-discovering sailor\" was the Russian nobleman and explorer Nikolai Rezanov.\n\nThe questions Voznesensky posed, \"Where is your grave, even a mound?\" allude to the fact that Rezanov's original burial site was lost. The answer to this question began to emerge in the late 20th century. Rezanov, who died in 1807 in Krasnoyarsk, Siberia, was the subject of Voznesensky's poem \"Avos!\" (1970), which later became the libretto for the famous Russian rock opera \"Juno and Avos\" (1981).\n\nThe opera recounts the tragic romance between Rezanov and María de la Concepción Argüello, the daughter of the commandant of the Presidio of San Francisco, whom he met during his expedition to California. Rezanov's original gravesite in Krasnoyarsk was destroyed by the Bolsheviks. While a memorial with a white cross now marks his reburied remains at the Trinity churchyard in Krasnoyarsk, the search for and re-establishment of his final resting place provided the answer to the poet's query decades later.\n\n<<<Rezanov>>>"
