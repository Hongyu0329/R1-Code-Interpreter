    "The maximum number of logical qubits that can be encoded in two separate patches of surface code, with each patch having two holes, is four.\n\nHere is the reasoning behind this calculation:\n\n*   **Logical Qubits and Holes:** In the surface code, a type of topological quantum error-correcting code, logical qubits are encoded by creating defects, or \"holes,\" in the 2D lattice of physical qubits. For a standard planar surface code patch, the number of logical qubits that can be encoded is equal to the number of holes created on the surface. Each hole allows for the definition of logical operators that are topologically distinct and protected from local errors.\n\n*   **Qubits per Patch:** Each of the two patches is specified to have two holes. Therefore, a single patch with two holes can encode a maximum of two logical qubits. While some practical implementations may use a pair of holes to represent a single logical qubit for ease of operations, the fundamental capacity of the code allows for one logical qubit per hole.\n\n*   **Total Number of Qubits:** The problem specifies two distinct patches. When patches are separate, the total number of logical qubits is the sum of the qubits encoded in each individual patch.\n\nTherefore, the total number of logical qubits is calculated as follows:\n(2 logical qubits per patch) Ã— (2 patches) = 4 logical qubits.\n\n<<<4>>>"
