    "The order type of a set is the unique ordinal number that is order-isomorphic to it, provided the set is well-ordered.\n\nFirst, we need to define the lexicographical (or lexical) order for the set of finite strings over the alphabet A = {a, b, c, d}. Let's assume the standard ordering a < b < c < d. For two strings, s1 and s2, s1 is lexicographically smaller than s2 if either:\n1.  s1 is a proper prefix of s2 (e.g., \"cat\" < \"cater\").\n2.  At the first position where the strings differ, the character in s1 is smaller than the character in s2 (e.g., \"apple\" < \"apply\").\n\nThe set in question is the set of all non-empty finite strings of characters from {a, b, c, d}, which we can denote as A+.\n\n**1. The set is countable:** The set of all finite strings from a finite alphabet is countably infinite.\n\n**2. The set is well-ordered:** A set is well-ordered if every non-empty subset has a least element. For any non-empty subset of strings, we can find the strings of minimum length. This subset is finite and non-empty, so it has a lexicographically smallest element. This element is the least element of the original subset. Because the set is well-ordered, its order type is an ordinal number.\n\n**3. Determining the ordinal:**\n\nLet τ be the order type of the set of all non-empty finite strings over the 4-character alphabet {a, b, c, d}. We can partition the set into four disjoint subsets:\n*   S_a: strings starting with 'a'\n*   S_b: strings starting with 'b'\n*   S_c: strings starting with 'c'\n*   S_d: strings starting with 'd'\n\nLexicographically, all strings in S_a come before all strings in S_b, which come before all in S_c, and so on. Therefore, the order type τ is the ordinal sum of the order types of these four subsets:\nτ = type(S_a) + type(S_b) + type(S_c) + type(S_d)\n\nNow let's analyze the order type of S_a. This set consists of the string 'a' itself, followed by all strings of the form \"as\" where 's' is any non-empty finite string. The mapping f(s) = \"as\" is an order-isomorphism between the set of all non-empty strings (with order type τ) and the set of strings in S_a that come after 'a'.\nThus, the order type of S_a is 1 + τ.\n\nSince S_a, S_b, S_c, and S_d are all structurally identical (just with different leading characters), they all have the same order type of 1 + τ.\nSubstituting this back into our equation for τ, we get:\nτ = (1 + τ) + (1 + τ) + (1 + τ) + (1 + τ)\n\nIn ordinal arithmetic, this is written as τ = (1 + τ) · 4.\n\nSince the set of strings is infinite, τ must be an infinite ordinal. For any infinite ordinal α, we have 1 + α = α. Therefore, the equation simplifies to:\nτ = τ · 4\n\nWe need to find the smallest infinite ordinal τ that satisfies this equation.\n*   τ = ω (the order type of natural numbers) does not work, as ω · 4 > ω.\n*   τ = ω^2 also fails, as ω^2 · 4 > ω^2.\n\nThis equation holds for ordinals of the form ω^β for limit ordinals β. The smallest such ordinal is ω^ω.\n\nThis can also be seen by creating an explicit order-preserving map from the set of finite strings to the ordinals less than ω^ω. If we map the characters {a, b, c, d} to the natural numbers {0, 1, 2, 3}, a string `s_n s_{n-1} ... s_1` can be mapped to the ordinal `ω^n · s_n + ω^{n-1} · s_{n-1} + ... + ω · s_1`. This mapping demonstrates that the set of finite strings ordered lexicographically is order-isomorphic to the set of ordinals that can be represented as polynomials in ω with finite coefficients, which is precisely the set of ordinals less than ω^ω.\n\nThe order type of the set of all such ordinals is ω^ω.\n\n<<<ω^ω>>>"
