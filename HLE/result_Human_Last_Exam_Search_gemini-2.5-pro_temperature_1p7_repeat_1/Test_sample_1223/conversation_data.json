    "It is a known result in topology that for a specific hereditarily indecomposable metric continuum, namely the pseudo-arc, the Stone-Čech remainder of the space with one point removed is homeomorphic to the pseudo-arc itself. The pseudo-arc is a classic example of a hereditarily indecomposable metric continuum.\n\nA fundamental theorem by Stefan Mazurkiewicz states that every non-degenerate metric indecomposable continuum has precisely *c* composants, where *c* is the cardinality of the continuum.\n\nTherefore, since the Stone-Čech remainder in question can be a pseudo-arc, it is possible for it to be a metric indecomposable continuum. As such, it can have *c* composants.\n\nConversely, if the remainder were a decomposable continuum, it would have only one composant. A continuum has more than one composant if and only if it is irreducible.\n\nThe number of composants of a metric continuum cannot exceed its total number of points, which is *c*. Given that a possible number of composants is *c*, this must be the maximum possible number.\n\n<<<c>>>"
