In the CCSD method, in addition to the singly and doubly excited Slater determinants which are zeroed by construction, the matrix elements $\langle \Phi_I | \bar{H} | \Phi \rangle$ are also identically zero for all quintuply, sextuply, and higher excited Slater determinants. This is a direct consequence of the fact that the electronic Hamiltonian contains at most two-body terms, which results in the expansion of $\bar{H}|\Phi\rangle$ terminating at quadruply excited determinants.
