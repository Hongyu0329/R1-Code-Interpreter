    "The initial search provided general information about Boolean expressions, their operators, and methods for simplifying them. However, it did not directly address the problem of counting the number of *true* Boolean expressions of a specific length using a given set of symbols. The search results focused more on counting Boolean functions or simplifying existing expressions. To solve the problem, a more direct approach of enumerating and evaluating all possible valid expressions of length 5 is needed. This will involve considering the allowed symbols (T, F, !, &, |, (, )) and the rules of expression formation. Since the initial searches were not specific enough, and this problem is more of a combinatorial and computational nature, further searching for a direct formula is unlikely to be fruitful. The next logical step is to systematically list and evaluate expressions.\nI have broken down the problem into finding all valid Boolean expressions of length 5 and then evaluating them to see which ones are true.\n\n**1. Valid 5-symbol expressions:**\n\nA valid Boolean expression must be syntactically correct. Given the symbols {T, F, !, &, |, (, )}, we can form expressions of length 5. Let's analyze the possible structures:\n\n*   **Expressions with binary operators (&, |):** These require two operands. A typical structure would be `A & B` or `A | B`. To have a length of 5, the operands A and B must be single symbols or enclosed in parentheses.\n    *   `T & T` (length 3)\n    *   `(T&T)` (length 5) - Evaluates to TRUE\n    *   `(T|T)` (length 5) - Evaluates to TRUE\n    *   `(T&F)` (length 5) - Evaluates to FALSE\n    *   `(F&T)` (length 5) - Evaluates to FALSE\n    *   `(T|F)` (length 5) - Evaluates to TRUE\n    *   `(F|T)` (length 5) - Evaluates to TRUE\n    *   `(F&F)` (length 5) - Evaluates to FALSE\n    *   `(F|F)` (length 5) - Evaluates to FALSE\n\n*   **Expressions with the unary operator (!):** This operator precedes its operand.\n    *   `!T` (length 2)\n    *   `!F` (length 2)\n    *   To make it length 5, we can add parentheses or more operators.\n        *   `!(!T)` (length 5) - `!F` which is TRUE\n        *   `!(!F)` (length 5) - `!T` which is FALSE\n        *   `!!(T)` (length 5) - This is not a standard representation, usually it would be `!!T`. If we consider `!!T`, that is length 3. If we consider `!!(T)` as a valid 5-symbol expression, then `!!T` evaluates to T, which is TRUE. Let's assume standard notation where parentheses enclose expressions, not single terms.\n        *   Let's consider expressions like `T&(!T)`. This has 5 symbols and is valid.\n            *   `T&(!T)` -> `T&F` -> FALSE\n            *   `T&(!F)` -> `T&T` -> TRUE\n            *   `F&(!T)` -> `F&F` -> FALSE\n            *   `F&(!F)` -> `F&T` -> FALSE\n            *   `T|(!T)` -> `T|F` -> TRUE\n            *   `T|(!F)` -> `T|T` -> TRUE\n            *   `F|(!T)` -> `F|F` -> FALSE\n            *   `F|(!F)` -> `F|T` -> TRUE\n\n*   **Expressions with nested parentheses:**\n    *   `(T&T)` - TRUE\n    *   `(T|T)` - TRUE\n    *   `(T|F)` - TRUE\n    *   `(F|T)` - TRUE\n    *   `!(!T)` - TRUE\n    *   `T&(!F)` - TRUE\n    *   `T|(!T)`- TRUE\n    *   `T|(!F)`- TRUE\n    *   `F|(!F)`- TRUE\n\nLet's list them systematically. A valid expression of length 5 must have a certain structure.\nPossible structures:\n1.  `(X&Y)`\n2.  `(X|Y)`\n3.  `!X!Y` (invalid)\n4.  `!!X` (length 3, not 5)\n5.  `!(X)` where X is an expression of length 3, e.g. `T&T`. `!(T&T)` -> `!T` -> FALSE\n6.  `X&!Y` where X and Y are 'T' or 'F'.\n7.  `X|!Y`\n8.  `!X&Y`\n9.  `!X|Y`\n\nLet's list all valid combinations and evaluate them:\n\n**Type 1: `(X op Y)` where X, Y are in {T, F} and op is in {&, |}**\n*   `(T&T)` - TRUE\n*   `(T&F)` - FALSE\n*   `(F&T)` - FALSE\n*   `(F&F)` - FALSE\n*   `(T|T)` - TRUE\n*   `(T|F)` - TRUE\n*   `(F|T)` - TRUE\n*   `(F|F)` - FALSE\n\n**Type 2: `!(expr)` where `expr` has length 3**\nPossible expr of length 3: `T&T`, `T&F`, `F&T`, `F&F`, `T|T`, `T|F`, `F|T`, `F|F`\n*   `!(T&T)` -> `!T` -> FALSE\n*   `!(T&F)` -> `!F` -> TRUE\n*   `!(F&T)` -> `!F` -> TRUE\n*   `!(F&F)` -> `!F` -> TRUE\n*   `!(T|T)` -> `!T` -> FALSE\n*   `!(T|F)` -> `!T` -> FALSE\n*   `!(F|T)` -> `!T` -> FALSE\n*   `!(F|F)` -> `!F` -> TRUE\n\n**Type 3: `!X op Y` where X,Y in {T,F} and op in {&,|}** (5 symbols)\n*   `!T&T` -> `F&T` -> FALSE\n*   `!T&F` -> `F&F` -> FALSE\n*   `!F&T` -> `T&T` -> TRUE\n*   `!F&F` -> `T&F` -> FALSE\n*   `!T|T` -> `F|T` -> TRUE\n*   `!T|F` -> `F|F` -> FALSE\n*   `!F|T` -> `T|T` -> TRUE\n*   `!F|F` -> `T|F` -> TRUE\n\n**Type 4: `X op !Y`**\n*   `T&!T` -> `T&F` -> FALSE\n*   `T&!F` -> `T&T` -> TRUE\n*   `F&!T` -> `F&F` -> FALSE\n*   `F&!F` -> `F&T` -> FALSE\n*   `T|!T` -> `T|F` -> TRUE\n*   `T|!F` -> `T|T` -> TRUE\n*   `F|!T` -> `F|F` -> FALSE\n*   `F|!F` -> `F|T` -> TRUE\n\n**Type 5: `!(!X)` where X is in {T, F}** (5 symbols)\n*   `!(!T)` -> `!F` -> TRUE\n*   `!(!F)` -> `!T` -> FALSE\n\n**Let's count the TRUE expressions from each type:**\n\n*   Type 1: `(T&T)`, `(T|T)`, `(T|F)`, `(F|T)` => 4 TRUE expressions\n*   Type 2: `!(T&F)`, `!(F&T)`, `!(F&F)`, `!(F|F)` => 4 TRUE expressions\n*   Type 3: `!F&T`, `!T|T`, `!F|T`, `!F|F` => 4 TRUE expressions\n*   Type 4: `T&!F`, `T|!T`, `T|!F`, `F|!F` => 4 TRUE expressions\n*   Type 5: `!(!T)` => 1 TRUE expression\n\nLet's double-check for other possible valid structures.\nWhat about `(!T)&T`? That is also 5 symbols. This is of the form `(X)&Y` where X is `!T`.  Let's refine the types:\n\nLet atoms be T or F.\nLet op be & or |.\nPossible valid structures of length 5:\n1. `(A op B)`: A,B are atoms. 2*2*2 = 8 expressions.\n    - `(T&T)`: T\n    - `(T&F)`: F\n    - `(F&T)`: F\n    - `(F&F)`: F\n    - `(T|T)`: T\n    - `(T|F)`: T\n    - `(F|T)`: T\n    - `(F|F)`: F\n    (4 True)\n\n2. `!(A op B)`: Invalid syntax based on precedence. Would require `!(A op B)`. If it is `(!A op B)`, then it is another category. If it is `!(A op B)`, that's `!(...` which would be length 6. Let's assume standard parsing `!A op B`.\n\n3. `!A op B`: A,B are atoms. 2*2*2 = 8 expressions. Precedence is `! > & > |`. So this is `(!A) op B`.\n    - `!T&T` -> F&T = F\n    - `!T&F` -> F&F = F\n    - `!F&T` -> T&T = T\n    - `!F&F` -> T&F = F\n    - `!T|T` -> F|T = T\n    - `!T|F` -> F|F = F\n    - `!F|T` -> T|T = T\n    - `!F|F` -> T|F = T\n    (4 True)\n\n4. `A op !B`: A,B are atoms. 2*2*2 = 8 expressions. This is `A op (!B)`.\n    - `T&!T` -> T&F = F\n    - `T&!F` -> T&T = T\n    - `F&!T` -> F&F = F\n    - `F&!F` -> F&T = F\n    - `T|!T` -> T|F = T\n    - `T|!F` -> T|T = T\n    - `F|!T` -> F|F = F\n    - `F|!F` -> F|T = T\n    (4 True)\n\n5. `!A op !B`: A,B are atoms. 2*2*2 = 8 expressions. This is `(!A) op (!B)`.\n    - `!T&!T` -> F&F = F\n    - `!T&!F` -> F&T = F\n    - `!F&!T` -> T&F = F\n    - `!F&!F` -> T&T = T\n    - `!T|!T` -> F|F = F\n    - `!T|!F` -> F|T = T\n    - `!F|!T` -> T|F = T\n    - `!F|!F` -> T|T = T\n    (4 True)\n\n6. `!(A)`: not length 5.\n7. `!(!A)`: A is an atom. 2 expressions.\n    - `!(!T)` -> !F = T\n    - `!(!F)` -> !T = F\n    (1 True)\n8. `!!(A)` : parentheses around a single atom are unusual but if allowed.  `!!T` is length 3. Let's assume `(T)` is not a valid expression of length 3, an expression in parentheses must contain an operator. So, `!!(T)` would be invalid.\n9. `(!A)`: not length 5.\n10. `(X)` where X is a 3-char expression.\n    Expressions of length 3: `T&T`, `T&F`, `F&T`, `F&F`, `T|T`, `T|F`, `F|T`, `F|F`.  But `(T&T)` is length 5. So X cannot have operators. X must be `!T` or `!F` if we allow `(!T)`. Then `(!T)` would be length 4. What about `(T)`? `!(T)` is 4.  I think my initial set of structures covered all bases.\n\nTotal so far: 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 17.\n\nAre there other structures?\n- A three-character expression enclosed in parentheses is `(X)`. If X can be `T&F`, we have `(T&F)`. This is 5 characters. This was my type 1.\n- `A&(B)`: 5 chars. If `(B)` is a valid sub-expression. Usually parentheses are for changing precedence or for function calls. If we consider `(T)` to be equivalent to `T`, then:\n    - `T&(T)` = T&T = T\n    - `T|(T)` = T|T = T\n    - `! (T)` = !T = F (length 4)\n    Let's check the rules of well-formed formulas (wff) in propositional logic.\n    1. T and F are wff.\n    2. If P is a wff, then !P is a wff.\n    3. If P and Q are wff, then (P & Q) and (P | Q) are wff.\n\n- `T` is a wff.\n- `F` is a wff.\n- `!T` is a wff (length 2)\n- `!F` is a wff (length 2)\n- `(T&T)` is a wff (length 5) - True\n- `(T&F)` is a wff (length 5) - False\n- `(T|F)` is a wff (length 5) - True\n- `(F&T)` is a wff (length 5) - False\n- `(F|T)` is a wff (length 5) - True\n- `(T|T)` is a wff (length 5) - True\n- `(F&F)` is a wff (length 5) - False\n- `(F|F)` is a wff (length 5) - False\n(4 true here)\n\nNow for expressions of length 5 built from smaller wffs.\n- Let P be `!T` (length 2) and Q be `T` (length 1). `(!T&T)` is not a wff according to the rule, it should be `((!T)&T)`.\nThis brings up an important point about the use of parentheses. The problem states \"precedence of operators is by convention ! > & > |\". This implies that parentheses are only needed to override precedence.  For example `T|F&T` is `T|(F&T)`.\n\nSo, are expressions without outer parentheses, like `T&T`, considered length 3? Yes. And `(T&T)` is length 5.\n\nWhat about `T&!F` (length 4)?  And `(!T)&F` (length 5).\nThis implies that an expression can also be formed by an operator and two operands (which can be atoms or other expressions).\n\nLet's reconsider the structure based on the central operator, and we don't need outer parentheses if the precedence is clear.\n\nIf the top-level operator is `&` or `|`, the expression is `A op B`. The total length is length(A) + 1 + length(B). We need this to be 5.\nPossible lengths for A and B:\n- length(A)=1, length(B)=3. A is 'T' or 'F'. B must be a 3-char expression.\n  - B could be of the form `(T)` - is this allowed? Let's assume no redundant parentheses.\n  - B could be of the form `!T`. Invalid length. `!T` is length 2.\n  - So, B must be of the form `(X)` - nope.  `T&F` is a valid 3-char expression if we don't need outer parentheses. Let's assume they are not needed if precedence is clear.\n  - Let's list all valid expressions systematically by length.\n    - Length 1: `T`, `F`. (2 expressions)\n    - Length 2: `!T`, `!F`. (2 expressions)\n    - Length 3:\n      - `T&T`, `T&F`, `F&T`, `F&F`, `T|T`, `T|F`, `F|T`, `F|F` (8 expressions)\n      - `!(!` is not valid.\n      - `(!T)` - length 4\n    - Length 4:\n      - `!A op B`: e.g. `!T&F` -> `F&F`=F, `!T|F`->`F|F`=F, `!F&T`->`T&T`=T, `!F|T`->`T|T`=T (2*2*2=8 expressions). 2 TRUE from & and 2 from |. (Let's recheck) `!F&F` -> `T&F`=F. `!T&T`=F, `!T&F`=F, `!F&T`=T, `!F&F`=F. (1 True from &).  `!T|T`=T, `!T|F`=F, `!F|T`=T, `!F|F`=T (3 True from |). Total of 4 True.\n      - `A op !B`: Symmetric to above, so 4 True expressions.\n      - `!!T`, `!!F`\n      - `(!T)` - length 4, value F. `(!F)` - length 4, value T. (1 True)\n    - Length 5:\n      - `A op B` where length(A)+length(B)=4.\n        - len(A)=1, len(B)=3: `T & (T&T)` - not standard syntax `T&T&T`. With precedence rules, this is fine. Let's analyze `A op B op C`.\n          - `T&T&T` -> T. `T&T&F` -> F. `T&F&T` -> F ... (2^3 = 8 combinations for `&`). Only `T&T&T` is true. (1 True).\n          - `T|T|T` -> T. ... Only `F|F|F` is false. (7 True).\n          - Mixed operators: `A op1 B op2 C`. Example: `T&F|T`. By precedence, this is `(T&F)|T` -> `F|T` -> T.\n          - We have 3 positions for T/F, and 2 for operators. `2^3 * 2^2 = 8 * 4 = 32` such expressions of the form `A op1 B op2 C`. Let's enumerate the true ones.\n            - `&`, `&`: `T&T&T` (1)\n            - `|`, `|`: `T|T|T`, `T|T|F`, `T|F|T`, `F|T|T`, `T|F|F`, `F|T|F`, `F|F|T` (7)\n            - `&`, `|`: A&B|C -> (A&B)|C. True if C is T, or if A&B is T.  If C=T (4 cases: TTT, TFT, FTT, FFT). If C=F, A&B must be T, so TTF. (5 True).\n            - `|`, `&`: A|B&C -> A|(B&C). True if A is T, or if B&C is T. If A=T (4 cases: TTT, TTF, TFT, TFF). If A=F, B&C must be T, so FTT. (5 True).\n            - `|`, `|` with & precedence `A|B|C` -> no ambiguity (7)\n            - Let's check other operator combinations: & and |, | and &. That's it.\n            - Total: 1+7+5+5 = 18.\n        - len(A)=2, len(B)=2: `!A op !B`.\n          - `!T&!T`=F, `!T&!F`=F, `!F&!T`=F, `!F&!F`=T. (1 True for &)\n          - `!T|!T`=F, `!T|!F`=T, `!F|!T`=T, `!F|!F`=T. (3 True for |)\n          (4 True expressions).\n\n      - `(A op B)` where len(A),len(B)=1.\n        - This is `(T&T)`, `(T&F)`, etc.\n        - `(T&T)`=T, `(T&F)`=F, `(F&T)`=F, `(F&F)`=F. (1 True)\n        - `(T|T)`=T, `(T|F)`=T, `(F|T)`=T, `(F|F)`=F. (3 True)\n        (4 True expressions).\n\n      - `!A op B` and `A op !B` where len(A)=1, len(B)=2? No, `!B` has length 2, `A` has 1. so total length is 1+1+2=4.\n      - Expressions with `!` and parentheses.\n        - `!(!T)` - length 4, `!(!F)` - length 4.\n        - `!(A op B)` where A,B are atoms. `!(T&T)` length 6. No.\n        - `!(X)` where X is length 3. X could be `T&T`. `!(T&T)` - length is 1+3=4. Ah, the parentheses are required, so `!(T&T)`. 1+5=6. Wait, `(T&T)` is length 5, so this would be `! ` followed by a 4-char expression.\n        - What are the 4-char expressions?\n            - `!A&B`, `A&!B`, `!A|B`, `A|!B`: 8 of each.\n            - `!!T`, `!!F`.\n            - `(!T)` and `(!F)`.\n            Let's apply `!` to these.\n            - `!(!T&F)` -> `!(F&F)` -> `!F` -> T\n            - `!(T&!F)` -> `!(T&T)` -> `!T` -> F\n            - `!(!!T)` -> `!T` -> F\n            - `!(!T)` -> `!!T` -> T\n            - This is getting complicated. Let's restart with a clearer enumeration of valid expressions.\n\nA syntactically valid expression (well-formed formula - wff) of length 5. Let's list the possible structures (parse trees).\n\n**Structure 1: Unary operation `!` applied to a wff of length 4.**\nwff of length 4:\n*   `!T&T` (F), `!T&F` (F), `!F&T` (T), `!F&F` (F) -> 1 true.  (1 from `!F&T`).  So `!(!F&T)` is `!T` which is F.\n*   `T&!T` (F), `T&!F` (T), `F&!T` (F), `F&!F` (F) -> 1 true.  (1 from `T&!F`). So `!(T&!F)` is `!T` which is F.\n*   `!T|T` (T), `!T|F` (F), `!F|T` (T), `!F|F` (T) -> 3 true. So applying `!` to them gives 3 false.\n*   `T|!T` (T), `T|!F` (T), `F|!T` (F), `F|!F` (T) -> 3 true. So applying `!` to them gives 3 false.\n*   Total true from `! (A op !B)` and `! (!A op B)` forms: `!(F)` becomes `T`.\n    *   From `!A&B`: `!T&T`(F), `!T&F`(F), `!F&F`(F) are the false ones. Applying `!` gives 3 true expressions: `!(!T&T)`, `!(!T&F)`, `!(!F&F)`.\n    *   From `A&!B`: `T&!T`(F), `F&!T`(F), `F&!F`(F). `!` gives 3 true: `!(T&!T)`, `!(F&!T)`, `!(F&!F)`.\n    *   From `!A|B`: `!T|F`(F). `!` gives 1 true: `!(!T|F)`.\n    *   From `A|!B`: `F|!T`(F). `!` gives 1 true: `!(F|!T)`.\n*   Other length 4 wffs:\n    *   `!!T` (T), `!!F` (F). Applying `!` gives `!!!T`(F) and `!!!F`(T). (1 true).\n    *   `(!T)` is not standard. But `!(T)` if T is a wff? `!(T)` len 3. `!(!T)` len 4. `!(!(!T))` len 6.\n    *   `!(!T)` is `T`. `!(!F)` is `F`.  `!(!(!T))` is `!T` = F.  `!(!(!F))` is `!F` = T. (1 True).  So length 5 could be `!!(!F)` or `!(!F)`. It depends on whether `!(!F)` is length 4 or 5. Let's assume `!`, `(`, `!`, `F`, `)` is 5 chars.  No, operators and atoms `!T` is 2.  `!!T` is 3.\n*   This suggests my first enumeration was more sound, assuming the set of symbols are characters to form a string of length 5. Let's go back to that.\n\nLet's list all possible valid strings of 5 symbols and check if they are true.\n\n**Case 1: `(A op B)`** where `A`, `B` are `T` or `F`, `op` is `&` or `|`.\n*   `(T&T)` -> T\n*   `(T|T)` -> T\n*   `(T|F)` -> T\n*   `(F|T)` -> T\n(4 true)\n\n**Case 2: `A op B` where one operand is length 2, the other is length 1.** Total length 1+1+2=4. We need length 5.\nHow to make length 5 from `A op B` structure?\n- len(A) + len(B) + 1 = 5 => len(A)+len(B) = 4.\n  - len(A)=2, len(B)=2. `!A op !B` structure where `A` and `B` are single T/F.\n    - `!T & !T` (F)\n    - `!T & !F` (F)\n    - `!F & !T` (F)\n    - `!F & !F` (T)\n    - `!T | !T` (F)\n    - `!T | !F` (T)\n    - `!F | !T` (T)\n    - `!F | !F` (T)\n    (4 true)\n\n**Case 3: Chained operators: `A op B op C`**\n- `A, B, C` are `T` or `F`. `op` is `&` or `|`.\n- Precedence: `&` over `|`.\n  - `T&T&T` (T)\n  - `T&T|T` -> (T&T)|T -> T\n  - `T&F|T` -> (T&F)|T -> T\n  - `F&T|T` -> (F&T)|T -> T\n  - `F&F|T` -> (F&F)|T -> T\n  - `T&T|F` -> T\n  - `T&F|F` -> F\n  - `F&T|F` -> F\n  - `F&F|F` -> F\n  - (So for `A&B|C`, we have 5 true)\n\n  - `T|T&T` -> T|(T&T) -> T\n  - `T|T&F` -> T|(T&F) -> T\n  - `T|F&T` -> T|(F&T) -> T\n  - `T|F&F` -> T|(F&F) -> T\n  - `F|T&T` -> F|(T&T) -> T\n  - `F|T&F` -> F\n  - `F|F&T` -> F\n  - `F|F&F` -> F\n  - (So for `A|B&C`, we have 5 true)\n\n  - For `A|B|C` only `F|F|F` is false, so 7 are true.\n  - For `A&B&C` only `T&T&T` is true, so 1 is true.\n\n  Total for this chained case = 1 + 5 + 5 + 7 = 18 true. But this assumes the two operators can be different.\n  The symbols are chosen from {T F ! & | ( )}. A single expression can use a symbol more than once.\n  The combinations are:\n  A & B & C (1 true)\n  A & B | C (5 true)\n  A | B & C (5 true)\n  A | B | C (7 true)\n  Total: 18 true expressions of this form.\n\n**Case 4: `!(X)` where X is an expression of length 3.**\n- Valid expressions of length 3:\n  - `T&T`(T), `T&F`(F), `F&T`(F), `F&F`(F)\n  - `T|T`(T), `T|F`(T), `F|T`(T), `F|F`(F)\n- The parentheses are necessary to scope the `!`.  So `!(T&T)` has length 6.  So this case is not possible if the symbols for the inner expression must also be counted. `!` + `(` + `T` + `&` + `T` + `)` is 6 symbols.\n\nHowever, if `X` is a wff of length 4, and we prepend `!` we get length 5.\n- Length 4 wffs:\n  - `!T&T`(F), `!T&F`(F), `!F&T`(T), `!F&F`(F).  There are 3 that are False. Applying `!` gives 3 True expressions: `!(!T&T)`, `!(!T&F)`, `!(!F&F)`.\n  - `T&!T`(F), `T&!F`(T), `F&!T`(F), `F&!F`(F). There are 3 that are False. Applying `!` gives 3 True expressions: `!(T&!T)`, `!(F&!T)`, `!(F&!F)`.\n  - `!T|T`(T), `!T|F`(F), `!F|T`(T), `!F|F`(T). There is 1 that is False. Applying `!` gives 1 True expression: `!(!T|F)`.\n  - `T|!T`(T), `T|!F`(T), `F|!T`(F), `F|!F`(T). There is 1 that is False. Applying `!` gives 1 True expression: `!(F|!T)`.\n  - `!!T`(T), `!!F`(F). One is false. Applying `!` gives `!!!F` which is T. So 1 True expression.\nTotal true from this case: 3 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 9 true.\n\nLet's re-verify the structure `!A op B`.  My count was 4 true: `!F&T`, `!T|T`, `!F|T`, `!F|F`. Let me re-evaluate `!F|F`. This is T|F which is T. Yes, my manual check seems right. So out of the 8 `!A op B` expressions, 4 are true.\nLet's check the false ones:\n`!T&T`(F), `!T&F`(F), `!F&T`(T), `!F&F`(F) -> 3 false\n`!T|T`(T), `!T|F`(F), `!F|T`(T), `!F|F`(T) -> 1 false\nTotal 4 false.  `!(!F&T)`(F), `!(!T|T)`(F), `!(!F|T)`(F), `!(!F|F)`(F).\nApplying `!` to the true ones gives false. Applying `!` to the false ones gives true. So there must be 4 true expressions of the form `!(A op B)` if we assume the structure is `(!A op B)`. Let's clarify `!(..._of_len_4)`.  `!(!T&F)` evaluates to `!(F&F)` which is `!F` which is T. OK.\nMy lists of True/False for `!A op B` were:\nTrue: `!F&T`, `!T|T`, `!F|T`, `!F|F`\nFalse: `!T&T`, `!T&F`, `!F&F`, `!T|F`\nSo applying `!` to the 'False' list gives 4 new true expressions of length 5: `!(!T&T)`, `!(!T&F)`, `!(!F&F)`, `!(!T|F)`.\n\nSame logic for `A op !B`, gives another 4 true expressions.\n\nAnd for `!!T` (T) and `!!F` (F). `!!!F` is a length 5 expression, and is True.\nSo far, my tally is:\n- `(A op B)`: 4 true\n- `!A op !B`: 4 true\n- `A op B op C`: 18 true\n- `!(!A op B)`: 4 true\n- `!(A op !B)`: 4 true\n- `!!!F`: 1 true\n\nIs `!!!T` a valid expression of 5 symbols? No, that's 3 symbols. I need to be careful with counting the symbols.\n- `T&F|T` -> 5 symbols. Yes.\n- `!(!T&T)` -> 5 symbols? `!`, `(`, `!`, `T`, `&`, `T`, `)`. That is 7.  The problem arises from how parentheses are counted.  \"using exactly 5 of the following symbols\"\n\nIf parentheses are only for overriding precedence, then `!(A&B)` is not a valid way to write `!A & !B`. `!(T&T)` evaluates to `!T`=F. If we write it, we use 6 symbols.\n\nLet's rethink from scratch what a 5-symbol string can be. The set is S = {T, F, !, &, |, (, )}.\nPossible structures for a length-5 string from S that is a valid boolean expression:\n\n1.  `(aob)`: where `a,b` are 'T' or 'F', and `o` is `&` or `|`. Total 2*2*2=8 expressions.\n    - `(T&T)`: T\n    - `(T&F)`: F\n    - `(F&T)`: F\n    - `(F&F)`: F\n    - `(T|T)`: T\n    - `(T|F)`: T\n    - `(F|T)`: T\n    - `(F|F)`: F\n    **4 true expressions.**\n\n2.  `a o b o c`: where `a,b,c` are 'T' or 'F', `o` is `&` or `|`. 3 atoms, 2 operators = 5 symbols.\n    - `a & b & c`: `T&T&T` is the only true one. **1 true expression.**\n    - `a | b | c`: `F|F|F` is the only false one. **7 true expressions.**\n    - `a & b | c`: this is `(a&b)|c`. True if `c=T` (4 cases) or if `a=T,b=T` (1 case `T&T|F`). **5 true expressions.**\n    - `a | b & c`: this is `a|(b&c)`. True if `a=T` (4 cases) or if `b=T,c=T` (1 case `F|T&T`). **5 true expressions.**\n    (Sub-total: 1 + 7 + 5 + 5 = 18 true expressions)\n\n3.  `!a o !b`: `!, a, o, !, b`. 5 symbols. `a,b` are atoms, `o` is an operator.\n    - `!T&!T`=F, `!T&!F`=F, `!F&!T`=F, `!F&!F`=T -> **1 true**.\n    - `!T|!T`=F, `!T|!F`=T, `!F|!T`=T, `!F|!F`=T -> **3 true**.\n    (Sub-total: 1 + 3 = 4 true expressions)\n\n4. `!(!a)`: `!, (, !, a, )`. 5 symbols. `a` is `T` or `F`.\n   - `!(!T)` -> `!F` -> T. **1 true expression.**\n   - `!(!F)` -> `!T` -> F.\n   (Sub-total: 1 true expression)\n\n5. `!(aob)`: `!, (, a, o, b, )`. This is 6 symbols. Not length 5.\n\n6. `(!a)o(b)` - No. `()` are for operators. `(!a)&b` is 5 symbols: `(, !, a, ), &, b`.\n   Let's check `(!a)&b`. Symbols: `(`, `!`, `a`, `)`, `&`, `b`. This is 6 symbols.\n\nLet's reconsider what constitutes an \"expression\". Given the precedence rule, `!a&b` is parsed as `(!a)&b`.  The length of this string is 4.  e.g., `!`, `T`, `&`, `F`.\n\nThis means my second major approach (`A op B op C` and `!A op !B`) is more likely correct than the parenthesized ones. Let's assume standard parsing without \"unnecessary\" parentheses. So, a string is formed, then parsed.\n\nLength 5 strings:\n- `A op B op C` (A,B,C atoms, op is `&` or `|`). 2^3 * 2^2 = 32 expressions. My count was 18 true ones.\n  - `T&T&T` (T)\n  - `T&T|T` (T), `T&T|F` (T), `T&F|T` (T), `T&F|F` (F), `F&T|T` (T), `F&T|F` (F), `F&F|T` (T), `F&F|F` (F). That's 5 true. `(a&b)|c`.\n  - `T|T&T` (T), `T|T&F` (T), `T|F&T` (T), `T|F&F` (T), `F|T&T` (T), `F|T&F` (F), `F|F&T` (F), `F|F&F` (F). That's 5 true. `a|(b&c)`.\n  - `T|T|T` (T), `T|T|F` (T), `T|F|T` (T), `T|F|F` (T), `F|T|T` (T), `F|T|F` (T), `F|F|T` (T), `F|F|F` (F). That's 7 true.\n  Total is 1 + 5 + 5 + 7 = 18. This seems correct.\n\n- `! A op ! B` (`!`, atom, op, `!`, atom). `2^2 * 2 = 8` expressions.\n  - `!T&!F`=`F&T`=F. `!F&!F`=`T&T`=T. `!T&!T`=F. `!F&!T`=F. (1 True)\n  - `!T|!F`=`F|T`=T. `!F|!F`=`T|T`=T. `!T|!T`=F. `!F|!T`=`T|F`=T. (3 True)\n  Total is 4. This seems correct.\n\n- Now for parentheses. A parenthesized expression must have length 5.\n  - `(A op B)`. A, B are atoms. `(T&F)`. `(`, T, &, F, `)`. 5 symbols.\n    - `(T&T)`=T\n    - `(T&F)`=F\n    - `(F&T)`=F\n    - `(F&F)`=F (1 True for &)\n    - `(T|T)`=T\n    - `(T|F)`=T\n    - `(F|T)`=T\n    - `(F|F)`=F (3 True for |)\n  Total is 4. This seems correct.\n\n- `!(!A)`: `!`, `(`, `!`, A, `)`. A is an atom. `!(!T)` is `!F`=T. `!(!F)` is `!T`=F.\n  - 1 true expression. This also seems correct.\n\n- `!!(!A)` or `!(!!A)`? No, this is 6 symbols. `!`, `!`, `(`, `!`, `A`, `)`. No.\n- `(!A)&B`: `(`, `!`, `A`, `)`, `&`, `B`. 6 symbols. No.\n- `A&(!B)`: `A`, `&`, `(`, `!`, `B`, `)`. 6 symbols. No.\n- `(!A)|B`: `(`, `!`, `A`, `)`, `|`, `B`. 6 symbols. No.\n\nWhat about something like `!T|!T`? length 4. What about `!!T|F`? Yes, length 5: `!`, `!`, `T`, `|`, `F`. `!!T` is T. `T|F` is T. This is a new valid structure.\nLet's call it `!!A op B`. A, B atoms, op is `&` or `|`. 2^2 * 2 = 8 expressions.\n- `!!T & T` = T&T=T\n- `!!T & F` = T&F=F\n- `!!F & T` = F&T=F\n- `!!F & F` = F&F=F\n(1 True for &)\n- `!!T | T` = T|T=T\n- `!!T | F` = T|F=T\n- `!!F | T` = F|T=T\n- `!!F | F` = F|F=F\n(3 True for |)\nTotal = 4 true expressions.\n\nAnd the symmetric case `A op !!B`. Also 4 true expressions.\n\nWhat about `!!!A`? That's length 3 for the symbols `!, !, !, T`. We need 5. `!!!(T)`? No.\nHow to get `!` involved in other ways?\n- Let's list combinations of symbols.\n  - 3 atoms, 2 ops: done (18). `A op B op C`.\n  - 2 atoms, 2 ops, 1 `!`: e.g. `!A op B op C` ? this is length 6. No. `A op !B op C`? No.\n  - 2 atoms, 1 op, 2 `!`: `!A op !B` (done, 4 true). `!!A op B` (done, 4 true). `A op !!B` (done, 4 true). `!(A op B)` - no, length 6.\n  - 1 atom, 2 ops, 2 `!`: `!T&!F` - done.\n  - 1 atom, 1 op, 3 `!`: `!!!T` not 5 symbols. Maybe `!T|!!F`? `!`,T,`|`,!,!,F - 6 symbols.\n  - `!!!A op B` ? length 6.\n\nLet's recheck the use of `()`.\n- `(A)op(B)` - `(T)&(F)` -> `(`, T, `)`, `&`, `(`, F, `)`. 7 symbols. No.\n- `(A&B)|C` -> `(`, A, &, B, `)`, `|`, C. 7 symbols. No. My analysis of `A&B|C` assumed no explicit parentheses, which is correct given the precedence rule.\n\nSo it seems my list of structures is getting more complete.\nCurrent total: 18 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 35.\n\nLet me list the structures again for a final check:\n1. `A op B op C` (e.g. `T&F|T`) - 18 true.\n2. `!A op !B` (e.g. `!T&!F`) - 4 true.\n3. `(A op B)` (e.g. `(T&F)`) - 4 true.\n4. `!(!A)` (e.g. `!(!T)`) - 1 true.\n5. `!!A op B` (e.g. `!!T|F`) - 4 true.\n6. `A op !!B` (e.g. `T|!!F`) - 4 true.\n\nAre there any others?\n- `(!A)` is length 4. So `!(!A)` is `!!A`. The string `!(!T)` has 4 symbols, not 5.\n  `!`, `(`, `!`, `T`, `)`. 5 symbols. OK, so `!(!A)` is a valid structure of 5 symbols. And my count of 1 true (`!(!T)`) is correct.\n\nWhat about `(!!A)`? `(`, `!`, `!`, A, `)`. 5 symbols.\n- `(!!T)` -> `(T)` -> T. True.\n- `(!!F)` -> `(F)` -> F.\nSo, 1 true expression here.\n\nWhat about `!(A)`? `!`, `(`, A, `)`. Length 4.\nWhat about `!A!B`? Invalid syntax. Needs an operator. `!A&!B` is what I used for `!A op !B`.\n\nConsider the placement of `!`.\n- Start of expression:\n  - `!A...`: if followed by operator, then `!A op ...`. Total 5 symbols.\n    - `!A op B`: length 4.\n    - `!A op !B`: `!T&!F`. `!`, T, `&`, `!`, F. 5 symbols. Correct. My count was 4.\n    - `!A op !!B`: `!T & !!F`. `!`, T, `&`, `!`, `!`, F. 6 symbols. No.\n  - `!!...`:\n    - `!!A`: length 3.\n    - `!!A op B`: `!!T & F`. 5 symbols. Correct. My count was 4.\n    - `!!(A)`: `!`, `!`, `(`, A, `)`. 5 symbols.  This evaluates to A.\n      - `!!(T)` -> T. True.\n      - `!!(F)` -> F.\n      This gives 1 True. I called it `(!!A)` earlier, same thing.\n\n  - `!!!...`: `!!!A` length 4. `!!!A op B` - 6.\n  - `!(...`:\n    - `!(!A)`: `!`, `(`, `!`, A, `)`. 5 symbols.  Evaluates to `A`. `!(!T)` is T. `!(!F)` is F. 1 true. Correct.\n    - `!(A)`: `! (A)` length 4. `!(T)` len 3 if parens are not symbols. But they are.\n    - `!(A op B)`: length 6.\n    - Let's check `!(A&!B)`. This would be `! (T&!F)`. `!,(,T,&,!,F,)`. 7 symbols. No.\n\nIt seems I have found all the structures. Let's make a final, clean list and count.\n\n**Valid 5-Symbol True Boolean Expressions**\n\n**Type A: Chained Operators (no parentheses)**\n1.  `A & B & C`: `T&T&T` (1)\n2.  `A | B | C`: All but `F|F|F` are true (7)\n3.  `A & B | C` (parsed as `(A&B)|C`): True if C=T (4 combos), or if A=T,B=T,C=F (1 combo) -> (5)\n4.  `A | B & C` (parsed as `A|(B&C)`): True if A=T (4 combos), or if A=F,B=T,C=T (1 combo) -> (5)\n    *Total for Type A: 1 + 7 + 5 + 5 = 18*\n\n**Type B: Expressions with `!` (no parentheses)**\n5.  `!A op !B`:\n    *   `&`: `!F&!F` is the only true one (1)\n    *   `|`: `!T|!F`, `!F|!T`, `!F|!F` are true (3)\n    *Total for this sub-type: 1 + 3 = 4*\n6.  `!!A op B`:\n    *   `&`: `!!T&T` is true (1)\n    *   `|`: `!!T|T`, `!!T|F`, `!!F|T` are true (3)\n    *Total for this sub-type: 1 + 3 = 4*\n7.  `A op !!B`: Same as above due to symmetry. (4)\n    *Total for Type B: 4 + 4 + 4 = 12*\n\n**Type C: Expressions with required parentheses**\n8.  `(A op B)`:\n    *   `&`: `(T&T)` is true (1)\n    *   `|`: `(T|T)`, `(T|F)`, `(F|T)` are true (3)\n    *Total for this sub-type: 1 + 3 = 4*\n9.  `!(!A)`: `!(!T)` is true (1)\n10. `(!!A)`: `(!!T)` is true (1)\n    *Total for Type C: 4 + 1 + 1 = 6*\n\n\n**Final Tally:**\nType A: 18\nType B: 12\nType C: 6\n\nTotal True Expressions: 18 + 12 + 6 = 36.\n\nLet's do a quick sanity check of the structures one last time.\n`A op B op C` is a valid sequence of 5 symbols. Parsing is determined by precedence.\n`!A op !B` is a valid sequence of 5 symbols.\n`!!A op B` is a valid sequence of 5 symbols.\n`A op !!B` is a valid sequence of 5 symbols.\n`(A op B)` is a valid sequence of 5 symbols.\n`!(!A)` is a valid sequence of 5 symbols.\n`(!!A)` is a valid sequence of 5 symbols.\n\nLooks consistent. The interpretation hinges on the \"using exactly 5 of the following symbols\" and conventional precedence rules. The count of true expressions for each structure seems correct as well. I'm confident in the total of 36.To find the number of true boolean expressions that can be written using exactly 5 of the symbols {T, F, !, &, |, (, )}, we must first identify all possible valid expression structures of length 5, and then evaluate how many of them result in TRUE. The precedence of operators is ! > & > |.\n\nHere are the possible valid structures for a Boolean expression of exactly 5 symbols, followed by an enumeration of the combinations that evaluate to TRUE for each structure.\n\n### 1. Expressions with Chained Operators\nThese expressions have the form `A op B op C`, where A, B, and C are atoms (T or F) and `op` can be `&` or `|`. This structure uses 3 atoms and 2 operators, for a total of 5 symbols.\n\n*   **`A & B & C`**: This expression is TRUE only if A, B, and C are all T.\n    *   `T & T & T` → TRUE (1 case)\n*   **`A | B | C`**: This expression is TRUE if at least one of A, B, or C is T. It is only FALSE when all are F.\n    *   There are 2³ = 8 total combinations, so 7 are TRUE.\n*   **`A & B | C`**: Due to operator precedence, this is parsed as `(A & B) | C`. It's TRUE if C is T (4 combinations), or if A and B are both T and C is F (1 combination).\n    *   This gives a total of 5 TRUE expressions.\n*   **`A | B & C`**: Parsed as `A | (B & C)`. It's TRUE if A is T (4 combinations), or if B and C are both T and A is F (1 combination).\n    *   This gives a total of 5 TRUE expressions.\n\nTotal for this category: 1 + 7 + 5 + 5 = **18**\n\n### 2. Expressions with Negation Operators\nThese structures involve the `!` symbol.\n\n*   **`!A op !B`**: This consists of 5 symbols: `!`, A, `op`, `!`, B.\n    *   For `&`: Only `!F & !F` (which is `T & T`) is TRUE (1 case).\n    *   For `|`: `!T | !F`, `!F | !T`, and `!F | !F` are TRUE (3 cases).\n    *   Total: 1 + 3 = 4 TRUE expressions.\n*   **`!!A op B`**: This consists of 5 symbols: `!`, `!`, A, `op`, B. The `!!A` part simplifies to just `A`.\n    *   For `&`: Only `!!T & T` (which is `T & T`) is TRUE (1 case).\n    *   For `|`: `!!T | T`, `!!T | F`, and `!!F | T` are TRUE (3 cases).\n    *   Total: 1 + 3 = 4 TRUE expressions.\n*   **`A op !!B`**: Symmetrical to the previous case.\n    *   Total: 4 TRUE expressions.\n\nTotal for this category: 4 + 4 + 4 = **12**\n\n### 3. Expressions Involving Parentheses\nParentheses are symbols and must be counted towards the total of 5.\n\n*   **(A op B)**: This uses 5 symbols: `(`, A, `op`, B, `)`.\n    *   For `&`: Only `(T & T)` is TRUE (1 case).\n    *   For `|`: `(T | T)`, `(T | F)`, and `(F | T)` are TRUE (3 cases).\n    *   Total: 1 + 3 = 4 TRUE expressions.\n*   **`!(!A)`**: This uses 5 symbols: `!`, `(`, `!`, A, `)`. This expression evaluates to A.\n    *   `!(!T)` evaluates to `T` (TRUE).\n    *   `!(!F)` evaluates to `F` (FALSE).\n    *   Total: 1 TRUE expression.\n*   **(!!A)**: This uses 5 symbols: `(`, `!`, `!`, A, `)`. This expression also evaluates to A.\n    *   `(!!T)` evaluates to `T` (TRUE).\n    *   `(!!F)` evaluates to `F` (FALSE).\n    *   Total: 1 TRUE expression.\n\nTotal for this category: 4 + 1 + 1 = **6**\n\n### Final Count\nSumming the counts from all categories gives the total number of true boolean expressions of exactly 5 symbols:\n18 + 12 + 6 = 36\n\n<<<36>>>"
