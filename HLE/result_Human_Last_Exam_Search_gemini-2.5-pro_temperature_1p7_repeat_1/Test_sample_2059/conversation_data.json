    "Let the given polynomial be $P(x)$, where\n$P(x) = \\prod_{i=0}^{19}\\left( 1+x^{3^i}+x^{2\\cdot 3^i}+ x^{3\\cdot 3^i}\\right)$\nThis polynomial can be written as a sum of terms with coefficients $a_k$:\n$P(x) = \\sum_k a_kx^k$\n\nWe are asked to find the value of $\\sum_k a_k^2$.\n\nA key property of polynomials is that the sum of the squares of its coefficients, $\\sum_k a_k^2$, is equal to the constant term of the product $P(x)P(x^{-1})$.\n\nLet's analyze this product.\n$P(x)P(x^{-1}) = \\left[ \\prod_{i=0}^{19}\\left( 1+x^{3^i}+x^{2\\cdot 3^i}+ x^{3\\cdot 3^i}\\right) \\right] \\left[ \\prod_{i=0}^{19}\\left( 1+x^{-3^i}+x^{-2\\cdot 3^i}+ x^{-3\\cdot 3^i}\\right) \\right]$\n\nWe can rearrange the terms to pair up the corresponding factors:\n$P(x)P(x^{-1}) = \\prod_{i=0}^{19}\\left[ \\left( 1+x^{3^i}+x^{2\\cdot 3^i}+ x^{3\\cdot 3^i}\\right) \\left( 1+x^{-3^i}+x^{-2\\cdot 3^i}+ x^{-3\\cdot 3^i}\\right) \\right]$\n\nThe constant term of a product of polynomials is the product of their individual constant terms. Let's find the constant term for a single factor in the product, which we'll call $C_i$.\n\nLet $y_i = x^{3^i}$. The $i$-th factor in the product is:\n$(1+y_i+y_i^2+y_i^3)(1+y_i^{-1}+y_i^{-2}+y_i^{-3})$\n\nTo find the constant term of this expression, we multiply the terms whose exponents sum to zero:\n*   $(1)(1) = 1$\n*   $(y_i)(y_i^{-1}) = 1$\n*   $(y_i^2)(y_i^{-2}) = 1$\n*   $(y_i^3)(y_i^{-3}) = 1$\n\nThe sum of these products gives the constant term for the $i$-th factor:\n$C_i = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4$\n\nSince the constant term of each of the 20 factors (for $i=0$ to $19$) is 4, the constant term of the entire product $P(x)P(x^{-1})$ is the product of these individual constant terms:\nConstant Term = $\\prod_{i=0}^{19} C_i = \\prod_{i=0}^{19} 4 = 4^{20}$\n\nAs established, this constant term is equal to the sum of the squares of the coefficients. Therefore:\n$\\sum_k a_k^2 = 4^{20}$\n\nThis can also be expressed as $(2^2)^{20} = 2^{40}$.\n\n<<<4^{20}>>>"
