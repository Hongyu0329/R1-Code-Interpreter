    "For a flow cytometry sorting experiment using Streptavidin beads with five detection channels (AF350, GFP, PE, AF647, and AF750), you should prepare a comprehensive set of controls to ensure accurate data acquisition, compensation, and gating. These controls can be grouped into three main categories.\n\n### 1. Controls for Instrument Setup and Compensation\nThese controls are fundamental for any multicolor flow cytometry experiment to correctly set up the instrument and to mathematically correct for the spectral overlap between different fluorochromes.\n\n*   **Unstained Control (1 control):** This sample consists of your cells or particles without any fluorescent labels. It is essential for determining the baseline level of autofluorescence and for setting the initial voltage on the detectors.\n*   **Single-Stain Controls (5 controls):** You need a separate control for each fluorophore in your panel. These are used to calculate the compensation matrix that corrects for spectral spillover. The positive population in these controls should be at least as bright as in your experimental sample.\n    *   AF350 positive control\n    *   GFP positive control (e.g., GFP-expressing cells or compensation beads for fluorescent proteins)\n    *   PE positive control\n    *   AF647 positive control\n    *   AF750 positive control\n\n### 2. Controls for Gating, Specificity, and Quality\nThese controls are critical for accurate data analysis, validating the specificity of your staining, and ensuring the quality of your sort.\n\n*   **Viability Control (1 control):** A sample stained only with a viability dye is crucial. Dead cells can non-specifically bind antibodies and exhibit higher autofluorescence, leading to false-positive results. Excluding dead cells is especially important for ensuring a pure sorted population of live cells.\n*   **Streptavidin-Specific Controls (2 controls):**\n    *   **Unstained Beads Control:** Running streptavidin beads alone allows you to check if the beads themselves are fluorescent in any of your channels.\n    *   **Non-Specific Binding Control:** This control consists of cells incubated with the fluorescently labeled streptavidin conjugate but without the preceding biotinylated antibody. It is essential for confirming that the streptavidin is not binding non-specifically to your cells.\n*   **Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls (5 controls):** FMO controls are samples stained with all the antibodies in your panel except for one. They are critical for accurately setting the gates to distinguish between positive and negative populations, as they reveal the spread of fluorescence from all other fluorophores into the channel of the missing one. You should prepare an FMO control for each of the five channels in your experiment.\n\n### 3. Biological Controls\nThese controls validate the biological aspect of your experiment.\n\n*   **Positive and Negative Biological Controls (at least 2 controls):** These include samples from cells or tissues known to express the target marker (positive control) and those known not to express it (negative control). These controls confirm that your staining protocol and antibodies are working as expected.\n\n### Summary of Essential Controls\n\nIn total, you should prepare for **at least 16 control samples** for this experiment:\n\n*   **Unstained Cells:** 1\n*   **Single-Stain Compensation:** 5\n*   **Viability Dye:** 1\n*   **Unstained Beads:** 1\n*   **Streptavidin Non-Specific Binding:** 1\n*   **Fluorescence Minus One (FMO):** 5\n*   **Biological Controls:** 2 (one positive, one negative)\n\nThis comprehensive set of controls is essential for obtaining reliable and reproducible results in a multicolor flow cytometry sorting experiment.\n\n<<<16>>>"
