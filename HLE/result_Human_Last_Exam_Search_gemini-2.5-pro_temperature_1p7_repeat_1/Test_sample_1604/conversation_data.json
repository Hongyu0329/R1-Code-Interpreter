    "The first step of identifying the historical battles painted by Lady Butler has been completed. The search results provide a list of her notable works, many of which depict specific battles. These include scenes from the Napoleonic Wars (like the Battle of Waterloo and Quatre Bras), the Crimean War (such as the Battle of Inkerman and the Siege of Sevastopol implied in 'The Roll Call'), the Anglo-Zulu War ('The Defence of Rorke's Drift'), the First Anglo-Afghan War ('Remnants of an Army'), the Mahdist War ('Charge of the Egyptian Camel Corps'), the First Boer War ('Floreat Etona!'), the Anglo-Egyptian War ('Tel-el-Kebir'), and the First World War ('A Detachment of Cavalry in Flanders' and a painting about the kicking of a football at Loos).\n\nThe next step is to find the specific dates for each of these battles to determine which occurred latest in history. While some dates are mentioned in the search results (e.g., Rorke's Drift - January 1879, Jellalabad - January 1842), a more systematic approach is needed to get the dates for all the identified battles.\n\nUpdated plan:\nResearch the specific dates of the following battles depicted in Lady Butler's paintings:\nBattle of Waterloo (depicted in 'Scotland Forever!')\nBattle of Quatre Bras (depicted in 'The 28th Regiment at Quatre Bras')\nBattle of Inkerman (implied in 'The Roll Call')\nThe Defence of Rorke's Drift\nRetreat to Corunna (mentioned in some lists of her works)\nBattle of Tel-el-Kebir\nFirst Anglo-Afghan War (depicted in 'Remnants of an Army')\nFirst Boer War (depicted in 'Floreat Etona!')\nBattle of Loos (depicted in a watercolour of London Irish Rifles)\nThe Retreat from Mons\nA Detachment of Cavalry in Flanders (First World War)\nCompare the dates of these battles to identify the latest one.\nState the battle that was depicted in a painting by Lady Butler and occurred latest historically as the final answer.The second step involved researching the dates of the various battles depicted in Lady Butler's paintings. The search results have provided specific dates or timeframes for these conflicts:\n\n*   **Retreat to Corunna:** January 1809\n*   **Battle of Quatre Bras:** June 16, 1815\n*   **Battle of Waterloo:** June 18, 1815\n*   **First Anglo-Afghan War (depicted in 'Remnants of an Army'):** 1839–1842\n*   **Battle of Inkerman:** November 5, 1854\n*   **The Defence of Rorke's Drift:** January 22–23, 1879\n*   **First Boer War (depicted in 'Floreat Etona!'):** December 1880 – March 1881\n*   **Battle of Tel-el-Kebir:** September 13, 1882\n*   **The Retreat from Mons:** August–September 1914\n*   **Battle of Loos:** September–October 1915\n*   **A Detachment of Cavalry in Flanders:** This painting is known to be a First World War subject, placing it in the 1914-1918 timeframe.\n\nBased on this information, the latest historical event depicted is related to the First World War. To be more precise, the Battle of Loos took place in September-October 1915. \"The Retreat from Mons\" occurred earlier in 1914. \"A Detachment of Cavalry in Flanders\" also depicts a scene from the First World War. To definitively determine the latest event, it is necessary to see if a more specific date can be found for the action depicted in \"A Detachment of Cavalry in Flanders\" and confirm that no other painted battle is from a later date. However, given that the Battle of Loos is in 1915, it is highly likely to be the latest among the named battles with specific dates.\n\nThe next step will be to confirm if \"A Detachment of Cavalry in Flanders\" or any other work depicts a later event in the First World War.\nBased on the research, the latest historical battle depicted in a painting by Lady Butler for which a specific date can be ascertained is the Battle of Loos.\n\n*   **Battle of Loos:** September - October 1915.\n\nOther battles and their dates include:\n*   **Retreat to Corunna:** January 1809.\n*   **Battle of Quatre Bras:** June 16, 1815.\n*   **Battle of Waterloo:** June 18, 1815.\n*   **First Anglo-Afghan War** ('Remnants of an Army'): 1839-1842.\n*   **Battle of Inkerman:** November 5, 1854.\n*   **The Defence of Rorke's Drift:** January 22-23, 1879.\n*   **First Boer War** ('Floreat Etona!'): December 1880 - March 1881.\n*   **Battle of Tel-el-Kebir:** September 13, 1882.\n*   **The Retreat from Mons:** August - September 1914.\n\nWhile Lady Butler also painted \"A Detachment of Cavalry in Flanders,\" which is a First World War subject, the specific event and its date within the 1914-1918 period are not readily available in the search results. However, the Battle of Loos in 1915 is a confirmed late event among her catalog of painted battles.\n\nTherefore, the Battle of Loos is the latest historically documented battle depicted in a painting by Lady Butler based on the provided information.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is **Battle of Loos**The previous research has established a list of battles painted by Lady Butler and their corresponding dates. The latest of these is the Battle of Loos in 1915. However, it was also noted that she painted other First World War subjects, namely \"The Retreat from Mons: The Royal Horse Guards\" and \"A Detachment of Cavalry in Flanders\". The date of the event depicted in \"A Detachment of Cavalry in Flanders\" was not specifically identified.\n\nThe latest search results confirm that Lady Butler continued to work into the late 1920s, completing \"The Retreat from Mons: The Royal Horse Guards\" in 1927 and \"A Detachment of Cavalry in Flanders\" in 1929. \"The Retreat from Mons\" itself took place in 1914. The watercolour of the London Irish Rifles at Loos depicts an event from September 1915. \"A Detachment of Cavalry in Flanders\" is her last known oil painting on a military subject. While the painting was completed in 1929, the specific historical event it depicts during the First World War is not pinpointed by a date in the search results.\n\nHowever, since \"A Detachment of Cavalry in Flanders\" is a First World War subject (1914-1918), any event within that period would be earlier than a hypothetical later conflict. The Battle of Loos at the end of 1915 remains the latest *dated* battle among her known works from the search results. To be absolutely certain, it would be beneficial to see if there is any information that dates the specific action in \"A Detachment of Cavalry in Flanders\" to a later point in the war, for instance, 1918. Without this information, the Battle of Loos stands as the latest confirmed historical event.\n\nGiven the information available, I am confident to proceed with the conclusion based on the latest confirmed dated event.\n\nThe Battle of Loos, which took place in September-October 1915, is the latest historically documented battle depicted in a painting by Lady Butler.The final step is to synthesize the gathered information and present the final answer. All the necessary dates of the battles have been collected.\n\nFinal Answer: The battle depicted in a painting by Lady Butler that was the latest historically is an action during the First World War. Specifically, her watercolour painting of the London Irish Rifles depicts them kicking a football across the trench line at the Battle of Loos in September 1915. Her last oil painting of a military subject was 'A Detachment of Cavalry in Flanders', completed in 1929, which also portrays a First World War scene, but the specific event and its date are not as precisely identified as the Battle of Loos.\n\nI have completed the steps and am ready to provide the final answer.The comprehensive research has identified several key paintings by Lady Butler and the historical battles they depict. The search results explicitly state that her last oil painting on a military theme was \"A Detachment of Cavalry in Flanders,\" which was completed in 1929 and depicts a scene from the First World War (1914-1918). Another painting, a watercolour, shows the London Irish Rifles at the Battle of Loos in September 1915.\n\nTo determine the latest *historically* depicted battle, we need to compare the dates of these events. The First World War (1914-1918) is later than all the other identified conflicts, such as the Napoleonic Wars, the Crimean War, and various colonial wars of the 19th century.\n\nWithin the First World War, the Battle of Loos occurred in September 1915. While the specific event in \"A Detachment of Cavalry in Flanders\" is not dated in the search results, the painting was completed much later, in 1929. However, the question asks for the *latest historically* depicted battle, not the latest painting. Since \"A Detachment of Cavalry in Flanders\" portrays an event from the First World War, the event it depicts must have occurred no later than 1918.\n\nComparing the end date of the First World War (November 1918) with the date of the Battle of Loos (September-October 1915), any event from the later stages of the First World War would be historically later. One of Lady Butler's last works was \"The Retreat from Mons: The Royal Horse Guards,\" completed in 1927, which depicts an event from 1914. This confirms her continued interest in depicting earlier battles later in her life.\n\nWithout a specific date for the scene in \"A Detachment of Cavalry in Flanders,\" it is impossible to definitively say whether it depicts an event later than the Battle of Loos. However, it is a First World War painting, and the war continued for three years after Loos. It is reasonable to conclude that a painting simply titled \"A Detachment of Cavalry in Flanders\" could depict a scene from anytime during the war on that front.\n\nGiven the information that \"A Detachment of Cavalry in Flanders\" was one of her last works on a military subject and that it portrays a scene from the First World War, it is the painting that represents the latest historical period of conflict in her work. Even without a specific date for the event depicted, the First World War (1914-1918) is definitively later than the Battle of Loos (1915).\n\nTherefore, the battle or military action depicted in \"A Detachment of Cavalry in Flanders\" is the latest historically among her known works.\n\nThe latest historical battle depicted in a painting by Lady Butler is a scene from the First World War, portrayed in her work titled *A Detachment of Cavalry in Flanders*.\n\nLady Butler, a renowned British painter of military scenes, had a long career spanning from the mid-19th century into the early 20th century. Her portfolio includes depictions of numerous significant conflicts.\n\nHere is a chronological list of some of her notable paintings and the historical events they portray:\n*   ***The 28th Regiment at Quatre Bras***: Depicts the Battle of Quatre Bras on June 16, 1815, during the Napoleonic Wars.\n*   ***Scotland Forever!***: Shows the charge of the Scots Greys at the Battle of Waterloo on June 18, 1815.\n*   ***Remnants of an Army***: Portrays the arrival of William Brydon in Jellalabad in January 1842, the sole survivor of a British army massacred during the First Anglo-Afghan War (1839-1842).\n*   ***The Roll Call***: While not a specific battle, it captures the aftermath of an engagement during the Crimean War (1853-1856), often associated with the Battle of Inkerman (November 5, 1854).\n*   ***The Defence of Rorke's Drift***: Illustrates the battle at Rorke's Drift on January 22-23, 1879, during the Anglo-Zulu War.\n*   ***Floreat Etona!***: Depicts an incident at the Battle of Laing's Nek in 1881 during the First Boer War.\n*   ***The Charge of the Egyptian Camel Corps***: A scene from the Mahdist War in the 1880s.\n*   ***The Retreat from Mons: The Royal Horse Guards***: Completed in 1927, this painting looks back at an event from the early stages of the First World War in 1914.\n*   **Watercolour of the London Irish Rifles at Loos**: This work shows an incident from the Battle of Loos, which took place in September 1915.\n\nHer last oil painting with a military subject was ***A Detachment of Cavalry in Flanders***, which she completed in 1929. This painting portrays a scene from the First World War (1914-1918). While the specific date of the event within the war is not precisely documented, the conflict itself is the latest historical war she depicted.\n\n<<<A Detachment of Cavalry in Flanders>>>"
