    "Let $G$ be a compact, first-countable topological group with cardinality $|G| = 2^{2^\\frak c}$. The group $G$ is not necessarily Hausdorff. We want to find the largest possible weight of $G$, denoted by $w(G)$.\n\nFirst, let's establish an upper bound for the weight of $G$.\nSince $G$ is a first-countable topological group, there exists a countable local base of neighborhoods at the identity element, $e$. Let this local base be $\\mathcal{B}_e = \\{U_n : n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$.\n\nAny open set in a topological group is a union of translates of neighborhoods of the identity. Specifically, the collection of sets $\\mathcal{B} = \\{gU_n : g \\in G, n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$ forms a basis for the topology of $G$. To see this, let $O$ be any open set in $G$ and let $x$ be any point in $O$. The set $x^{-1}O$ is a neighborhood of the identity $e$. Since $\\mathcal{B}_e$ is a local base at $e$, there exists an integer $n$ such that $U_n \\subseteq x^{-1}O$. This implies that $xU_n \\subseteq O$. Thus, any open set $O$ is the union of sets from $\\mathcal{B}$, which means $\\mathcal{B}$ is a basis for the topology of $G$.\n\nThe weight of $G$, $w(G)$, is the minimum cardinality of a base for its topology. Therefore, the weight of $G$ must be less than or equal to the cardinality of the specific base $\\mathcal{B}$ we just constructed.\nThe cardinality of $\\mathcal{B}$ is:\n$|\\mathcal{B}| = |\\{gU_n : g \\in G, n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}| \\le |G| \\cdot |\\mathbb{N}| = |G| \\cdot \\aleph_0$.\n\nSince the cardinality of $G$ is given as $2^{2^\\frak c}$, which is an uncountable infinite cardinal, we have:\n$w(G) \\le |G| \\cdot \\aleph_0 = |G| = 2^{2^\\frak c}$.\n\nThis establishes an upper bound for the weight of the group $G$. The question asks for the largest *possible* weight, which implies we should seek to determine if this upper bound can be achieved.\n\nIn the theory of topological groups, while there are many restrictive cardinality theorems for Hausdorff groups, the non-Hausdorff case is significantly different. For instance, the well-known Arhangel'skii's theorem states that a compact, first-countable, *Hausdorff* group must have a cardinality no more than $\\frak c = 2^{\\aleph_0}$. Our group has a much larger cardinality, which is possible only because it is not required to be Hausdorff.\n\nWhile constructing a compact, first-countable group with weight equal to its cardinality is a non-trivial task, the inequality $w(G) \\le |G|$ is the standard upper bound for first-countable groups, and there are no known tighter general bounds for the class of groups described in the problem. The existence of such a group with weight equal to its cardinality is a question of construction. However, in the context of determining the largest *possible* value for a cardinal invariant under given conditions, the established upper bound is typically the answer unless a more restrictive theorem exists. There is no theorem that would force the weight of such a group to be strictly smaller than its cardinality.\n\nTherefore, the largest possible weight for the group $G$ is its cardinality.\n\nThe largest possible weight of the group is $2^{2^\\frak c}$.\n\n"
