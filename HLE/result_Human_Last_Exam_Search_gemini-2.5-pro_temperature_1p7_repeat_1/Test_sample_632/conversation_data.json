    "Until the early 20th century, the Piazza della Rotonda in Rome featured a unique architectural element that was later removed. This was a small building, often referred to as the \"palazzina-albergo,\" that was located on the side of the square.\n\nHistorical photographs and records from the late 19th and early 20th centuries show this structure, which contributed to the enclosed and bustling character of the piazza at the time. However, as part of various urban renewal and \"liberation\" projects aimed at isolating and emphasizing ancient monuments, this building was demolished. These projects, some of which were initiated during the Fascist era and continued in the post-war period, sought to create a more open and monumental setting for the Pantheon.\n\nWhile the exact year can be subject to some variation in historical accounts, the removal of this and other adjacent structures was part of a broader trend of \"clearing\" the area around major landmarks in Rome.\n\nTherefore, the unique architectural feature removed from the Piazza della Rotonda by the mid-20th century was this small adjacent building, the demolition of which was part of a larger effort to reshape the urban landscape of the city and provide a more grandiose view of the Pantheon.\n\n<<<A small building, often referred to as the \"palazzina-albergo,\" located on the side of the square.>>>"
