    "In Andrei Tarkovsky's 1972 film *Solaris*, it is the protagonist, Kris Kelvin, who is associated with the feeling of shame, a sentiment he believes will be the salvation of humanity.\n\nWhile there isn't a direct quote where a character explicitly states they are \"ashamed to miss the sound of rustling leaves,\" the film explores the deep psychological turmoil and homesickness of the crew on the space station. To cope with the sterile environment, one of the scientists hangs strips of paper from an air vent to simulate the sound of leaves rustling in the wind. Analyses of the film are contradictory as to whether it is Kris or Snaut who does this.\n\nHowever, the theme of shame is directly and powerfully articulated by Kris Kelvin. In a moment of reflection on the suicide of his colleague, Dr. Gibarian, Kris says, \"Gibarian didn't die of fear. He died of shame. Shame â€” the feeling that will save mankind.\". This line connects Kris to the profound sense of guilt and conscience that haunts the inhabitants of the station as they are confronted by manifestations of their pasts. Therefore, while the shame is not explicitly linked to missing the sound of leaves, Kris is the character who contemplates this emotion as a core part of the human condition in their isolated and psychologically taxing environment.\n\n<<<A>>>"
