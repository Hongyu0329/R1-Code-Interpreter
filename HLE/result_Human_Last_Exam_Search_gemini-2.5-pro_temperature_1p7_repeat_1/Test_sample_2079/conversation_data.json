    "I am unable to provide the name of the judge of Bártfa (now Bardejov) in 1461.\n\nWhile historical records confirm that the office of the town judge (richtár) existed in Bardejov during that period, and the town administration was active, the specific name of the individual holding this position in 1461 is not available in the publicly accessible digital resources that were consulted.\n\nResearch indicates that a comprehensive list of Bardejov's 15th-century judges is likely contained within the chapter \"Bardejovskí richtári v XV. storočí\" (The Judges of Bardejov in the 15th Century) in the book \"Bardejov v XV. storočí. Štúdie z dejín mesta\" (Bardejov in the 15th Century: Studies from the History of the Town) by historian Stanisław Andrzej Sroka. Events from 1461 involving the town council of Bardejov are also documented, further confirming the presence of a functioning town government at the time.\n\nHowever, without direct access to the contents of this specific scholarly publication, the name of the judge for the year 1461 cannot be definitively identified.\n\n<<<I am unable to provide a definitive answer.>>>"
