    "Let $K$ be the splitting field of the polynomial $P(x) = x^7 - 2 x^5 - 9 x^3 + 3 x^2 + 18 x - 6$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$. For an intermediate field $L$ such that $\\mathbb{Q} \\subsetneq L \\subsetneq K$, the extension $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is normal if it is a Galois extension. The possible degrees of such extensions are determined by the structure of the Galois group of $P(x)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nFirst, the polynomial $P(x)$ can be factored as:\n$P(x) = x^5(x^2 - 2) - 9x(x^2 - 2) + 3(x^2 - 2) = (x^5 - 9x + 3)(x^2 - 2)$.\n\nLet $f(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$ and $g(x) = x^2 - 2$. The splitting field $K$ of $P(x)$ is the compositum of the splitting fields of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$.\n\nThe splitting field of $g(x) = x^2 - 2$ is $K_g = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, and its Galois group is $\\text{Gal}(K_g/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong C_2$, the cyclic group of order 2.\n\nFor the polynomial $f(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$:\n1.  It is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$ by Eisenstein's criterion with the prime $p=3$.\n2.  The derivative is $f'(x) = 5x^4 - 9$, which has two real roots. This implies that $f(x)$ has at most three real roots. By evaluating $f(x)$ at its critical points, it can be shown that it has exactly three real roots.\n3.  An irreducible polynomial of degree 5 over $\\mathbb{Q}$ with exactly three real roots has the symmetric group $S_5$ as its Galois group over $\\mathbb{Q}$. So, $\\text{Gal}(K_f/\\mathbb{Q}) = S_5$, where $K_f$ is the splitting field of $f(x)$.\n\nThe splitting field of $P(x)$ is $K = K_f K_g$. To determine the Galois group of $K/\\mathbb{Q}$, we consider the intersection of the two splitting fields, $K_f \\cap K_g$. The only quadratic subfield of $K_f$ is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{D})$, where $D$ is the discriminant of $f(x)$. The discriminant is $D = -14,863,419$. Since $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-14,863,419})$ is not equal to $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, the intersection $K_f \\cap K_g$ is $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nTherefore, the Galois group of $K/\\mathbb{Q}$ is the direct product of the individual Galois groups:\n$G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong \\text{Gal}(K_f/\\mathbb{Q}) \\times \\text{Gal}(K_g/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong S_5 \\times C_2$.\nThe order of this group is $|G| = |S_5| \\times |C_2| = 120 \\times 2 = 240$.\n\nAccording to the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory, normal extensions $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ contained in $K$ correspond to normal subgroups of $G$. The degree of such an extension $[L:\\mathbb{Q}]$ is the index of the corresponding normal subgroup in $G$. We are looking for degrees corresponding to proper, non-trivial normal subgroups of $S_5 \\times C_2$.\n\nThe normal subgroups of $S_5 \\times C_2$ are:\n1.  The trivial subgroup, `{(e, 1)}`. This corresponds to $L=K$.\n2.  `{e} \\times C_2`. This subgroup has order 2, and its index is $240/2 = 120$.\n3.  `A_5 \\times {e}`, where `A_5` is the alternating group. `A_5` is a normal subgroup of `S_5`. This subgroup has order 60, and its index is $240/60 = 4$.\n4.  `S_5 \\times {e}`. This subgroup has order 120, and its index is $240/120 = 2$.\n5.  `A_5 \\times C_2`. This subgroup has order $60 \\times 2 = 120$, and its index is $240/120 = 2$.\n6.  The \"diagonal\" subgroup $H = \\{(g, \\text{sgn}(g)) | g \\in S_5\\}$, where `sgn` is the sign homomorphism. This subgroup is normal and has order 120. Its index is $240/120 = 2$.\n7.  The entire group `S_5 \\times C_2`, which corresponds to $L=\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nExcluding the trivial and the entire group, the indices of the proper normal subgroups are 120, 4, and 2. Thus, the possible degrees for such normal field extensions $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ are 2, 4, and 120.\n\n<<<The possible degrees are 2, 4, and 120.>>>"
