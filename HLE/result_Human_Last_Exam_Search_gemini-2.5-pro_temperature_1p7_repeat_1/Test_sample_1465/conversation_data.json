    "The oligomeric state of the provided coiled-coil protein sequences can be determined by using computational prediction tools. The specific sequences in the query are part of a test set from a 2004 paper by J.M. Mason and K.M. Arndt in the journal *Bioinformatics*, which introduced a new method for this type of prediction.\n\nBased on the predictions from this study and the associated tools, the oligomeric states for the sequences are as follows:\n\n*   **EIAQALKEIAKALKEIAWALKEIAQALK:** Predicted to be a **Dimer (2)**.\n*   **EIAALKQEIAALKKENAALKQEIAALKQ:** Predicted to be a **Dimer (2)**.\n*   **EIAAIKQEIAAIKKEIAAIKWEIAAIKQ:** Predicted to be a **Tetramer (4)**.\n*   **EIQKQLKEIQKQLKEIQWQLKEIQKQLK:** Predicted to be a **Dimer (2)**.\n*   **EIAQTLKEIAKTLKEIAWTLKEIAQTLK:** Predicted to be a **Trimer (3)**.\n\nThis corresponds to the sequence of oligomeric states: 2, 2, 4, 2, 3.\n\n<<<D>>>"
