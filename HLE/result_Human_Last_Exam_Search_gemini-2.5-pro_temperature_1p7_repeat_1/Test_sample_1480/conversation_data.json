    "The rule activation level of an interval type-3 fuzzy set is calculated by applying a t-norm operation to the firing strength of the antecedent and the membership value of the consequent.\n\nGiven:\n*   The firing strength of the antecedent, **Φ_k(x′) = 0.7**\n*   The membership value of the consequent, **μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9**\n\nA t-norm is a type of function used in fuzzy logic to represent the \"AND\" operation. The two most commonly used t-norms are the **minimum** and the **product**.\n\nTherefore, the rule activation level is calculated as follows:\n\n*   **Using the minimum t-norm:**\n    min(0.7, 0.9) = 0.7\n\n*   **Using the product t-norm:**\n    0.7 * 0.9 = 0.63\n\n<<<The rule activation level is **0.7** when using the minimum t-norm and **0.63** when using the product t-norm.>>>"
