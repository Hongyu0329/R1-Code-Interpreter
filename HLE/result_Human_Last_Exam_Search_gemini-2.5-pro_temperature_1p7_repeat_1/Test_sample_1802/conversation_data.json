    "The rank of the complementary channel of a quantum channel $\\Lambda$ is given by the rank of the Choi matrix of $\\Lambda$, which is also known as the Choi rank of the channel. This rank corresponds to the minimum number of Kraus operators required to represent the channel. For a quantum channel acting on a $d$-dimensional Hilbert space (a qudit), the Choi matrix is a $d^2 \\times d^2$ positive semi-definite matrix, so its rank can be at most $d^2$.\n\nA Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ for a $d$-dimensional quantum system (qudit) is defined by its action on the generalized Pauli operators. The generalized Pauli operators, often denoted as $\\{U_{ij}\\}_{i,j=0}^{d-1}$, form a complete orthonormal basis for the space of $d \\times d$ matrices. A Pauli channel can be expressed in the Kraus representation as:\n$$\n\\Lambda(\\rho) = \\sum_{i,j=0}^{d-1} p_{ij} U_{ij} \\rho U_{ij}^\\dagger\n$$\nwhere the coefficients $p_{ij}$ are non-negative and sum to one, i.e., $\\sum_{i,j=0}^{d-1} p_{ij} = 1$. The operators $K_{ij} = \\sqrt{p_{ij}} U_{ij}$ are the Kraus operators of the channel.\n\nThe rank of the complementary channel is the number of linearly independent Kraus operators in a minimal representation. The generalized Pauli operators $\\{U_{ij}\\}$ are all linearly independent. Therefore, the rank of the complementary channel is equal to the number of non-zero coefficients $p_{ij}$.\n\nTo find the maximal rank, we need to find a valid Pauli channel with the maximum number of non-zero coefficients $p_{ij}$. The maximum possible number of such coefficients is $d^2$, corresponding to the case where all $p_{ij}$ are greater than zero.\n\nA well-known example of a Pauli channel where all $d^2$ coefficients can be non-zero is the depolarizing channel. For a completely depolarizing channel, the output is always the maximally mixed state, and its Kraus operators can be written as $K_{ij} = \\frac{1}{d} U_{ij}$ for all $i,j \\in \\{0, \\dots, d-1\\}$. In this case, all $d^2$ Kraus operators are non-zero, and they are linearly independent. Thus, the rank of the complementary channel is $d^2$.\n\nSince the rank of the complementary channel cannot exceed $d^2$ for any channel on a $d$-dimensional system, and we have found a Pauli channel that achieves this rank, the maximal rank is $d^2$.\n\n<<<The maximal rank of the complementary channel of a Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ acting on a $d$-dimensional qudit is $d^2$.>>>"
