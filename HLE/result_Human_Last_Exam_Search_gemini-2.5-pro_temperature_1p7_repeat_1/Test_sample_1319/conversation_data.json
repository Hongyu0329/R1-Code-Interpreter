    "After Mount Olympus, the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the *Iliad* is Mount Athos.\n\nSeveral mountains are referenced in the epic poem, but three prominent historical peaks stand out, after Olympus itself. These are Mount Athos, Mount Ida in the Troad, and Mount Fengari on the island of Samothrace.\n\nWith an elevation of 2,033 meters (6,670 feet), Mount Athos is the highest of these. This mountain in northern Greece is mentioned in the *Iliad* and was historically significant enough that the Persian king Xerxes I had a canal dug at its base to avoid sailing around its treacherous cape.\n\nThe other notable mountains from the *Iliad* are:\n*   **Mount Ida (modern-day Kazdağı in Turkey):** This mountain, from which the gods were said to have watched the Trojan War, has a height of 1,770 meters (5,820 feet). It was a sacred place in mythology, particularly associated with the goddess Cybele and the judgment of Paris.\n*   **Mount Fengari on Samothrace (also known as Mount Saos):** The tallest mountain in the Aegean islands, it rises to 1,611 meters (5,285 feet). According to legend, the god Poseidon observed the Trojan War from its summit.\n\n<<<Mount Athos>>>"
