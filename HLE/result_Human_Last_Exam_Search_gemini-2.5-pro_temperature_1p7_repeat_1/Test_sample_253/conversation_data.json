    "When applying the cellular automaton Rule 110 for 20 successive iterations starting from a single cell in state 1, the resulting binary pattern is **111110111011011101001**.\n\nRule 110 is an elementary cellular automaton where the state of a cell (either 0 or 1) in a one-dimensional grid is determined by its own state and the states of its two immediate neighbors in the previous step. The rule is named for the binary representation of 110, which is 01101110. This sequence dictates the outcome for each of the eight possible three-cell neighborhood patterns.\n\nThe rules for determining the new state of the center cell are as follows:\n\n| Current Pattern (Left, Center, Right) | New State for Center Cell |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| 111 | 0 |\n| 110 | 1 |\n| 101 | 1 |\n| 100 | 0 |\n| 011 | 1 |\n| 010 | 1 |\n| 001 | 1 |\n| 000 | 0 |\n\nStarting with a single '1' and applying these rules for 20 steps generates a complex, evolving pattern. The step-by-step evolution is as follows:\n\n*   **Step 0:** 1\n*   **Step 1:** 11\n*   **Step 2:** 111\n*   **Step 3:** 1101\n*   **Step 4:** 11111\n*   **Step 5:** 110001\n*   **Step 6:** 1110011\n*   **Step 7:** 11010111\n*   **Step 8:** 111111001\n*   **Step 9:** 1100001011\n*   **Step 10:** 11100011111\n*   **Step 11:** 110100110001\n*   **Step 12:** 1111101110011\n*   **Step 13:** 11000110010111\n*   **Step 14:** 111001110111001\n*   **Step 15:** 1101011011001011\n*   **Step 16:** 11111101101011111\n*   **Step 17:** 110000110111100001\n*   **Step 18:** 1110001111000100011\n*   **Step 19:** 11010011001001100111\n*   **Step 20:** 111110111011011101001\n\nThis resulting pattern showcases the complex behavior that can arise from simple, deterministic rules, a characteristic that has led to Rule 110 being proven as capable of universal computation.\n\n<<<111110111011011101001>>>"
