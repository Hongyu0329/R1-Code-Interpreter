    "The provided sequence of numbers is:\n1014, 1020, 1032, 1050, 1104, 1224, 1230, 1290, 1410, 1440, 1452, 1482, 1500, 1512, 1560, 1584, 1602, 1734, 1812, 1890, 1902, 1932, 1974, 2004, 2040, 2064, 2070, 2130, 2142, 2274, 2340, 2352\n\nUpon analyzing the sequence, a simple arithmetic or geometric progression is not immediately apparent. The differences between consecutive numbers are irregular.\n\nHowever, a key characteristic of all the numbers in the sequence is that they are divisible by 6. A number is divisible by 6 if it is divisible by both 2 and 3. All the numbers in the list are even, and the sum of the digits of each number is a multiple of 3, confirming their divisibility by 6.\n\nFor example:\n*   1014: 1+0+1+4 = 6 (divisible by 3)\n*   1020: 1+0+2+0 = 3 (divisible by 3)\n*   ...\n*   2352: 2+3+5+2 = 12 (divisible by 3)\n\nThe provided sequence is a selection of four-digit numbers that are all multiples of 6. While the rule for selecting these specific numbers is not clear from the sequence itself, the most logical next number would continue this established pattern. The last number in the sequence is 2352. The next multiple of 6 after 2352 is 2358.\n\n<<<2358>>>"
