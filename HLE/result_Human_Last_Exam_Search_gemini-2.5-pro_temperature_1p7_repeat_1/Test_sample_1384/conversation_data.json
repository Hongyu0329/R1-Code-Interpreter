    "To determine the first two non-zero digits of the decimal representation of $e^{-7^{13}}$, we need to analyze the number in scientific notation.\n\nLet the number be $x = e^{-7^{13}}$. To find its decimal representation, we can use logarithms. The common logarithm (base 10) of *x* is given by:\n\n$\\log_{10}(x) = \\log_{10}(e^{-7^{13}})$\n\nUsing the properties of logarithms, this can be written as:\n\n$\\log_{10}(x) = -7^{13} \\cdot \\log_{10}(e)$\n\nThe term $\\log_{10}(e)$ is a constant, approximately equal to 0.43429. It is the reciprocal of the natural logarithm of 10 ($\\ln(10) \\approx 2.30259$).\n\nFirst, we calculate the value of $7^{13}$:\n$7^{13} = 96,889,010,407$\n\nNext, we multiply this by $\\log_{10}(e)$. Using a high-precision value for $\\log_{10}(e)$:\n$\\log_{10}(x) \\approx -96,889,010,407 \\cdot 0.4342944819$\n$\\log_{10}(x) \\approx -42,078,020,338.7221$\n\nNow, we can express *x* as a power of 10. We can split the logarithm into its integer and fractional parts:\n$\\log_{10}(x) = -42,078,020,339 + 0.2779$\n\nThis means:\n$x = 10^{-42,078,020,339 + 0.2779}$\n$x = 10^{0.2779} \\cdot 10^{-42,078,020,339}$\n\nThe term $10^{-42,078,020,339}$ indicates that the decimal point is shifted 42,078,020,339 places to the left, resulting in a very large number of leading zeros. The first non-zero digits are determined by the value of $10^{0.2779}$.\n\nCalculating this value:\n$10^{0.2779} \\approx 1.896$\n\nThus, the number *x* can be written in scientific notation as approximately $1.896 \\times 10^{-42,078,020,339}$. This means the decimal representation starts with over 42 billion zeros, followed by the digits 1, 8, 9, 6, and so on.\n\nThe first two non-zero digits of the decimal representation of $e^{-7^{13}}$ are therefore 1 and 8.\n\n<<<18>>>"
