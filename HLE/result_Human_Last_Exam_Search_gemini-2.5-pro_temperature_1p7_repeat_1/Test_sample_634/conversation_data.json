    "To find the greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of the polynomial matrices P1 and P2, we can use the method of row reduction on the compound matrix formed by stacking P1 and P2.\n\nThe given matrices are:\nP1 = [s² + s, -s;\n      -s² - 1, s²]\n\nP2 = [s, 0;\n      -s - 1, 1]\n\n**1. Form the compound matrix P(s):**\nWe stack P1 on top of P2 to form a single 4x2 matrix:\nP(s) =\n  [s² + s,  -s]      (R1)\n  [-s² - 1,  s²]      (R2)\n  [s,          0]       (R3)\n  [-s - 1,    1]       (R4)\n\n**2. Apply elementary row operations:**\nThe goal is to reduce this matrix to its simplest form (row-echelon form) using elementary row operations. These operations include swapping rows, multiplying a row by a non-zero constant, and adding a polynomial multiple of one row to another.\n\nLet's use the rows with the lowest degree polynomials (R3 and R4) to simplify the others.\n\n*   Perform `R1 <- R1 - (s+1) * R3`:\n    *   First element: (s² + s) - (s+1)(s) = 0\n    *   Second element: -s - (s+1)(0) = -s\n    The new R1 is `[0, -s]`.\n\n*   Perform `R2 <- R2 + s * R3`:\n    *   First element: (-s² - 1) + s(s) = -1\n    *   Second element: s² + s(0) = s²\n    The new R2 is `[-1, s²]`.\n\n*   Perform `R4 <- R4 + R3`:\n    *   First element: (-s - 1) + s = -1\n    *   Second element: 1 + 0 = 1\n    The new R4 is `[-1, 1]`.\n\nThe matrix becomes:\n  [0, -s]\n  [-1, s²]\n  [s, 0]\n  [-1, 1]\n\nLet's continue simplifying. Let's use the new fourth row, `[-1, 1]`, to eliminate other entries.\n\n*   Perform `Row 2 <- Row 2 - s² * Row 4`:\n    *   First element: -1 - s²(-1) = s² - 1\n    *   Second element: s² - s²(1) = 0\n    The new Row 2 is `[s² - 1, 0]`.\n\nThe matrix is now:\n  [0, -s]\n  [s² - 1, 0]\n  [s, 0]\n  [-1, 1]\n\nNow, use `Row 3` (`[s, 0]`) to simplify `Row 2` (`[s² - 1, 0]`).\n\n*   Perform `Row 2 <- Row 2 - s * Row 3`:\n    *   First element: (s² - 1) - s(s) = -1\n    *   Second element: 0 - s(0) = 0\n    The new Row 2 is `[-1, 0]`.\n\nThe matrix is now:\n  [0, -s]\n  [-1, 0]\n  [s, 0]\n  [-1, 1]\n\nNow, use the new `Row 2` (`[-1, 0]`) to simplify the others.\n\n*   Perform `Row 3 <- Row 3 + s * Row 2`:\n    *   First element: s + s(-1) = 0\n    *   Second element: 0 + s(0) = 0\n    The new Row 3 is `[0, 0]`.\n\n*   Perform `Row 4 <- Row 4 - Row 2`:\n    *   First element: -1 - (-1) = 0\n    *   Second element: 1 - 0 = 1\n    The new Row 4 is `[0, 1]`.\n\nThe matrix becomes:\n  [0, -s]\n  [-1, 0]\n \n \n\nFinally, use the new `Row 4` (`[0, 1]`) to simplify `Row 1`.\n\n*   Perform `Row 1 <- Row 1 + s * Row 4`:\n    *   First element: 0 + s(0) = 0\n    *   Second element: -s + s(1) = 0\n    The new Row 1 is `[0, 0]`.\n\nAnd multiply `Row 2` by -1. The final set of non-zero rows, reordered, gives:\n \n \n \n \n\n**3. Identify the GCRD:**\nThe non-zero part of the reduced matrix is the greatest common right divisor. In this case, the GCRD is the 2x2 identity matrix.\n\nA GCRD, G(s), is such that P1(s) = Q1(s)G(s) and P2(s) = Q2(s)G(s) for some polynomial matrices Q1 and Q2. Since G(s) is the identity matrix, Q1 = P1 and Q2 = P2, which are polynomial matrices. This confirms it is a common right divisor.\n\nFurthermore, the procedure of row-reducing the compound matrix ensures that the result is the *greatest* common right divisor.\n\n<<<[1, 0; 0, 1]>>>"
