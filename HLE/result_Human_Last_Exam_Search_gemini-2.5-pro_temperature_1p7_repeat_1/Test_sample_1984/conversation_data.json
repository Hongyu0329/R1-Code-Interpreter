    "To solve the problem, I first need to determine the number of stable equilibria, denoted by $m$, for the given differential equation:\n$x'(t) = -x^{3}(t) + 2x^{2}(t) - x(t)$\n\nEquilibrium points are found by setting $x'(t) = 0$. Let $f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 - x$.\n$-x^3 + 2x^2 - x = 0$\nFactoring out $-x$, we get:\n$-x(x^2 - 2x + 1) = 0$\nThis can be further factored as:\n$-x(x - 1)^2 = 0$\n\nThe equilibrium points are the roots of this equation, which are $x = 0$ and $x = 1$.\n\nNext, I need to determine the stability of these equilibrium points. The stability of an equilibrium point $x^*$ for an autonomous differential equation $x' = f(x)$ can be analyzed using the sign of the derivative of $f(x)$ at that point, $f'(x^*)$.\n- If $f'(x^*) < 0$, the equilibrium point is stable.\n- If $f'(x^*) > 0$, the equilibrium point is unstable.\n- If $f'(x^*) = 0$, the test is inconclusive, and a different method is needed, such as analyzing the sign of $f(x)$ in the neighborhood of the equilibrium point.\n\nThe derivative of $f(x)$ is:\n$f'(x) = -3x^2 + 4x - 1$\n\nNow, let's test the equilibrium points:\nFor $x = 0$:\n$f'(0) = -3(0)^2 + 4(0) - 1 = -1$.\nSince $f'(0) < 0$, the equilibrium point $x = 0$ is stable.\n\nFor $x = 1$:\n$f'(1) = -3(1)^2 + 4(1) - 1 = -3 + 4 - 1 = 0$.\nSince $f'(1) = 0$, the linear stability test is inconclusive. I must analyze the sign of $f(x) = -x(x-1)^2$ around $x=1$.\n- For $x$ slightly less than 1 (e.g., $x=0.9$), $x > 0$ and $(x-1)^2 > 0$. So, $f(x) = -(\\text{positive})(\\text{positive}) < 0$. This means $x(t)$ is decreasing and moves away from 1.\n- For $x$ slightly greater than 1 (e.g., $x=1.1$), $x > 0$ and $(x-1)^2 > 0$. So, $f(x) = -(\\text{positive})(\\text{positive}) < 0$. This means $x(t)$ is decreasing and moves towards 1.\n\nSince solutions on one side of $x=1$ move away from it, this equilibrium point is not stable. It is classified as semi-stable. A semi-stable equilibrium is not considered stable.\n\nTherefore, there is only one stable equilibrium point, which is $x=0$.\nSo, the number of stable equilibria is $m=1$.\n\nThe problem asks to find the value of $m - 2^{4048}$.\nSubstituting the value of $m$:\n$1 - 2^{4048}$\n\nThus, the final answer is $1 - 2^{4048}$.\n\n<<<1 - 2^4048>>>"
