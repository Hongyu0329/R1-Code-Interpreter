    "The stability of the Backward Differentiation Formula (BDF) methods is a crucial aspect of their use in solving stiff ordinary differential equations. A method is considered $A(\\alpha)$-stable if its stability region contains an angular sector of half-angle $\\alpha$ symmetric about the negative real axis. For BDF methods of order 3 and higher, this angle $\\alpha$ is less than 90°, meaning they are not A-stable.\n\nThe angle $\\alpha$ for the $A(\\alpha)$-stability of a BDFk method is determined by the tangent from the origin to the boundary of the stability region. The exact values for these angles were discovered by Akrivis and Katsoprinakis and can be expressed in terms of algebraic numbers. The boundary of the stability region for a k-step BDF method is given by the root locus curve:\n$\\mu(z) = \\sum_{j=1}^{k} \\frac{1}{j} (1 - z^{-1})^j$ where $z = e^{i\\phi}$.\n\nFor the BDF4 method, the angle $\\alpha$ is defined by the maximum value of $|\\arg(-\\mu(z))|$. This maximum is achieved at the point where a line from the origin is tangent to the stability boundary curve. Recent works have provided exact expressions for these angles. For the BDF4 method, this value is given by:\n$\\tan^2(\\alpha_4) = \\frac{489+329\\sqrt{7}}{27}$\n\nTherefore, the exact value of the angle $\\alpha$ is given by:\n$\\alpha = \\arctan\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{489+329\\sqrt{7}}{27}}\\right)$\n\nNumerically, this corresponds to an angle of approximately 73.35°.\n\n<<<$\\alpha = \\arctan\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{489+329\\sqrt{7}}{27}}\\right)$>>>"
