    "The currently used common name for the genus \"Perdita (Smith, 1853)\" in their native range of North America is \"fairy bees\". They are also sometimes referred to as \"miner bees\", though this name can also apply to other groups of bees.\n\nThe exact year the term \"fairy bees\" was coined is difficult to pinpoint from available information. The name appears in various online resources, including a 2020 article from the Vermont Center for Ecostudies and a 2022 article from the Honey Bee Suite, which refers to *Perdita minima* as the \"euphorb mini-fairy bee\". A 2022 forum post on iNaturalist mentions a rumor that the name was first used on Twitter, but this is not confirmed. While the name is in current use, a definitive year of its first coining is not readily available in publications.\n\n<<<fairy bees, not found>>>"
