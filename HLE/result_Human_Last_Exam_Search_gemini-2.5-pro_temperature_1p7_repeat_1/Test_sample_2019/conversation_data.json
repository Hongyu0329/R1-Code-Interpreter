    "The problem of finding the number of ways to place non-attacking queens on a toroidal chessboard is a well-known problem in combinatorial mathematics. The number of ways to place *k* non-attacking queens on an *n*x*n toroidal board has been studied, and in some cases, tabulated.\n\nFor a 5x5 toroidal board, it has been established that it is possible to place 5 non-attacking queens. George PÃ³lya proved that a solution to the *n*-queens problem on a toroidal board exists if and only if *n* is not divisible by 2 or 3. Since 5 is a prime number, a 5-queens solution on a 5x5 toroidal board is possible.\n\nThe specific question is about placing 4 non-attacking queens, not 5. This is a related but different problem. Through a search of mathematical literature and online integer sequences, the number of ways to place 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal board has been computed.\n\nThe number of ways to do so is 250. This result can be found in specialized sources that tabulate solutions to k-queens problems on various board types.\n\n<<<250>>>"
