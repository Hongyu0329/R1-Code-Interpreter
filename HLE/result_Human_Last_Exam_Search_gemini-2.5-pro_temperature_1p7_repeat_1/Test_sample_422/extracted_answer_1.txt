Given the provided constraints, the two problems the Justified True Belief (JTB) theory of knowledge runs into are:

1.  **The Epistemic Regress Problem:** The requirement for justification leads to an infinite regress, circular reasoning, or reliance on arbitrary, unjustified foundational beliefs.
2.  **The Problem of Justification Strength:** The theory fails to specify whether justification must be infallible (which leads to skepticism) or fallible (which makes the threshold for knowledge arbitrary).
