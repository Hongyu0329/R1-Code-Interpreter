    "Assuming the Justified True Belief (JTB) definition of knowledge and ignoring Gettier problems, two significant issues arise concerning the nature and quality of the \"justification\" component. These problems challenge the theory at its core by questioning how a belief can become sufficiently justified to be considered knowledge.\n\nThe two problems are:\n\n1.  **The Epistemic Regress Problem (The Foundational Problem):** The JTB model requires a belief to be justified, but it doesn't explain how the chain of justification can validly end. For any justified belief, one must ask what justifies it. That justification, being another belief, requires its own justification, and so on. This leads to three problematic possibilities, often called Agrippa's Trilemma:\n    *   **Infinite Regress:** The chain of justifications goes on forever, meaning no belief is ever fully justified.\n    *   **Circularity:** The chain of justifications eventually loops back on itself (e.g., A is justified by B, and B is justified by A), which is a logical fallacy.\n    *   **Arbitrary Assumption:** The chain stops at a \"basic belief\" that is accepted without any justification.\n\n    All three outcomes are philosophically unsatisfactory. If a justification ultimately rests on an arbitrary assumption or an infinite, un completable chain, it undermines the integrity of the \"justification\" condition required for knowledge. The JTB model doesn't inherently solve this, making the foundation of knowledge unstable.\n\n2.  **The Problem of Justification Strength (The Infallibility Problem):** The JTB theory is ambiguous about how strong a justification must be. This creates a dilemma with two equally problematic horns:\n    *   **If Justification Must Be Infallible:** If knowledge requires a justification so strong that it guarantees the belief's truth (infallibilism), then it becomes almost impossible to know anything. We would have to concede that nearly all that we consider knowledge—from scientific facts to everyday observations—is not knowledge at all because our justifications are fallible (they leave some possibility of error). This leads to radical skepticism.\n    *   **If Justification Can Be Fallible:** If a less-than-certain justification is allowed (fallibilism), the JTB theory provides no principled, non-arbitrary line to determine *how much* justification is enough. With only two epistemic states available (Belief and Knowledge), it becomes unclear what separates a \"sufficiently justified\" true belief (Knowledge) from an \"insufficiently justified\" true belief (mere Belief). This makes the distinction seem arbitrary and subjective.\n\nIn essence, these two problems attack the \"J\" in JTB from different angles. The regress problem questions the ultimate source and structure of any justification, while the strength problem questions the required quality or certainty of that justification.\n\n<<<Given the provided constraints, the two problems the Justified True Belief (JTB) theory of knowledge runs into are:\n\n1.  **The Epistemic Regress Problem:** The requirement for justification leads to an infinite regress, circular reasoning, or reliance on arbitrary, unjustified foundational beliefs.\n2.  **The Problem of Justification Strength:** The theory fails to specify whether justification must be infallible (which leads to skepticism) or fallible (which makes the threshold for knowledge arbitrary).>>>"
