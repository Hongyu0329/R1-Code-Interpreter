    "When Glia maturation factor-γ (GMFG), an actin-disassembly protein, is broken down or reduced, it allows for increased macrophage engulfment of amyloid-β42. A study demonstrated that the knockdown of GMFG in bone marrow-derived macrophages and a macrophage cell line resulted in an increase in the phagocytosis of amyloid-β42. This suggests that GMFG normally plays a role in regulating the process of amyloid phagocytosis by these immune cells. The enhanced engulfment of amyloid-β42 in cells with reduced GMFG was found to be mediated through the scavenger receptor class A type I (SR-AI).\n\n<<<Glia maturation factor-γ (GMFG)>>>"
