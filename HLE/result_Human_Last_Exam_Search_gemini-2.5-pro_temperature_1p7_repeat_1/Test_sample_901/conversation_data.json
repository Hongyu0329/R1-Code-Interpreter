    "The reaction of (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane with potassium tert-butoxide in tert-butyl alcohol is an E2 elimination reaction. For an E2 reaction to occur in a cyclohexane ring, the leaving group (bromine) and a β-hydrogen must be in an anti-periplanar (diaxial) arrangement.\n\nThe (1S,2R) stereochemistry indicates that the bromine and methyl groups are *trans* to each other. For the reaction to proceed, the cyclohexane must adopt a chair conformation where the bromine is in an axial position. In the trans isomer, if the bromine is axial, the methyl group on the adjacent carbon must also be axial to maintain the trans relationship (one group pointing up, one pointing down).\n\nLet's analyze the β-hydrogens in this diaxial conformation:\n\n1.  **β-hydrogen at C2:** The carbon atom C2, which is bonded to the methyl group, has its methyl group in the axial position. Consequently, the hydrogen on C2 is in the equatorial position. Since this hydrogen is not anti-periplanar to the axial bromine, elimination cannot occur to form a double bond between C1 and C2. This means the Zaitsev product, 1-methylcyclohexene, cannot be formed.\n2.  **β-hydrogen at C6:** The carbon atom C6 has two hydrogens. One of these hydrogens is in an axial position, which is anti-periplanar to the axial bromine on C1.\n\nDue to this stereochemical requirement, the bulky base, potassium tert-butoxide, can only abstract the axial hydrogen from C6. This leads to the formation of a double bond between C1 and C6. The resulting product is the less substituted alkene, known as the Hofmann product.\n\nTherefore, the only possible elimination product is 3-methylcyclohexene.\n\n<<<3-methylcyclohexene>>>"
