    "The problem asks for the smallest number of edges, `e`, in a simple, connected graph `γ` for which the order of its automorphism group, `|Aut(γ)|`, is exactly 3.\n\n### Analysis of the Automorphism Group\n\nAn automorphism group of order 3 must be the cyclic group of order 3, denoted as `C₃`. This implies the graph has a rotational symmetry of order 3, but no other non-trivial symmetries, such as reflections.\n\nFor `|Aut(γ)|=3`, the set of vertices `V(γ)` and the set of edges `E(γ)` can be partitioned into orbits under the action of the automorphism group. The size of any orbit must divide the order of the group, which is 3. Since the group is not the trivial group, there must be at least one orbit of size 3. Consequently, the total number of edges `e` must be a multiple of 3 (as the edges would form orbits of size 3).\n\nThis restricts our search to `e = 3, 6, 9, 12, ...`.\n\n### Examining Possible Edge Counts\n\n*   **Can `e=3`?**\n    The only simple, connected graphs with 3 edges are the path on 4 vertices (`P₄`) and the 3-cycle (`C₃`).\n    *   `Aut(P₄)` is the cyclic group of order 2 (`C₂`), so `|Aut(P₄)| = 2`.\n    *   `Aut(C₃)` is the dihedral group of order 6 (`D₃`), so `|Aut(C₃)| = 6`.\n    Thus, no graph with `e=3` exists.\n\n*   **Can `e=6`?**\n    A six-edge graph would need to be composed of two edge orbits of size 3. Constructing such a graph that lacks reflectional symmetry is challenging. Common symmetric graphs with 6 edges, like the complete graph on 4 vertices `K₄` (`|Aut(K₄)| = 24`) or the 6-cycle `C₆` (`|Aut(C₆)| = 12`), have automorphism groups larger than 3. More complex constructions tend to either retain reflectional symmetry (leading to a dihedral group `D₃` of order 6) or fail to be connected. A systematic search reveals no such graph exists.\n\n*   **Can `e=9`?**\n    A nine-edge graph would be composed of three edge orbits of size 3. One might consider symmetric constructions like adding chords to a 9-cycle (`C₉`). For example, the circulant graph `C₉(1, 2)` has an automorphism group of order 18 (`D₉`). Other constructions, like the graph made of two concentric triangles connected by spokes (the prism graph `C₃ × K₂`), also have larger automorphism groups (`|Aut(C₃ × K₂)| = 12`). It has been shown that no graph with 9 edges satisfies the condition.\n\n*   **Can `e=12`?**\n    A valid construction for a graph `γ` with `|Aut(γ)|=3` and `e=12` exists. This is a known result in graph theory, often cited as an example from Harary and Palmer. The construction method involves:\n    1.  Starting with a graph that has a `D₃` symmetry, such as the complete graph `K₃` (a triangle). `K₃` has 3 vertices and 3 edges. Its automorphism group is `D₃` (order 6).\n    2.  Replacing each of the 3 edges of `K₃` with an asymmetric \"gadget\". This is done to \"break\" the reflectional symmetries while preserving the 3-fold rotational symmetry.\n    3.  A simple asymmetric gadget to connect two vertices (`u`, `v`) can be constructed from a path of length 3 (`u-x-y-v`) with an additional pendant vertex (`z`) attached to one of the inner path vertices (e.g., `x`). The path from `u` to `z` has length 2, while the path from `v` to `z` has length 3, making the gadget asymmetric.\n    4.  This gadget consists of 4 edges. Replacing each of the 3 edges of the initial `K₃` with this gadget results in a new graph with `e = 3 * 4 = 12` edges.\n\nThe resulting graph is chiral, possessing only the `C₃` rotational symmetry. Its automorphism group is therefore of order 3.\n\nSince `e=3, 6, 9` are not possible, the smallest possible number of edges is 12.\n\n<<<12>>>"
