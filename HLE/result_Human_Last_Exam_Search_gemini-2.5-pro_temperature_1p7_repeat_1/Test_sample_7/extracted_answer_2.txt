a quote a once read in the novelist ian fleming, a saying it would take a saint to break from the pattern a saw to a man from the sinister well. if it had anything confidential to say, he wrote it in cipher. this method of communication had been passed down to him from his father, who had learned it during his years as a codebreaker in the war. the cipher was complex, a series of shifting letters and symbols that seemed random to the untrained eye but were a masterpiece of logic and structure to those who a knew the system. he would spend hours meticulously encoding each message, carefully crafting his words to fit within the encrypted language.
