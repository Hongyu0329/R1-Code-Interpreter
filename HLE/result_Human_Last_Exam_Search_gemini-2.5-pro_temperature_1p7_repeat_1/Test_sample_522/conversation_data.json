    "An analysis of the provided input-output pairs reveals a consistent transformation rule. This rule can be understood as a move in a grid-based puzzle, similar to a cellular automaton or a form of solitaire.\n\n### The Transformation Rule\n\nThe grid contains three types of values: 0, 1, and 2. The number '2' is the active piece that moves.\n\n1.  **Identify the '2'**: Locate the position of the '2' in the grid. Let's call this position `P2 = (row, col)`.\n2.  **Find the 'Mirror'**: The '2' uses a diagonally adjacent '1' as a \"mirror\" for its move. The rule iterates through the four diagonal neighbors of `P2` in a specific order (reading order: top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right) to find the first '1'. Let's call the position of this first diagonal '1' `P1`.\n3.  **Determine the Destination**: The '2' \"reflects\" across the 'mirror' `P1`. The destination position, `P0`, is the diagonal position opposite to `P1` relative to `P2`.\n4.  **Check for Validity**: The move is only valid if the destination cell `P0` contains a '0'.\n5.  **Execute the Move**: If the move is valid, the '2' moves from `P2` to `P0`. The original position `P2` is updated to '0', and the destination `P0` is updated to '2'. All other cells, including the 'mirror' `1` at `P1`, remain unchanged.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Examples\n\n*   **Input_A**: The '2' at `(1,1)` finds its only valid move by using the '1' at `(2,2)` as a mirror, moving it to the '0' at `(0,0)`. This matches `Output_A`.\n*   **Input_B**: The '2' at `(3,6)` has two potential moves. The first one found, according to the search order, is by using the '1' at `(4,5)` as a mirror. This correctly predicts the move to `(2,7)`, matching `Output_B`.\n\n### Solving for Input_C\n\nNow, we apply this established rule to `Input_C`.\n\n*   **Input_C Grid**:\n    ```\n    000000\n    011120\n    111111\n    ```\n\n1.  The '2' is at `P2 = (1,4)`.\n2.  We check its diagonal neighbors in order: `(0,3)`, `(0,5)`, `(2,3)`, `(2,5)`. The first one containing a '1' is at `P1 = (2,3)`.\n3.  The destination `P0` is opposite to `P1(2,3)` relative to `P2(1,4)`, which is `(0,5)`.\n4.  The cell at `P0(0,5)` contains a '0', so the move is valid.\n5.  The '2' moves from `(1,4)` to `(0,5)`. The cell `(1,4)` becomes '0'.\n\nThe resulting grid is:\n```\n000002\n011100\n111111\n```\nThis corresponds to the output string `'000002,011100,111111'`.\n\n<<<000002,011100,111111>>>"
