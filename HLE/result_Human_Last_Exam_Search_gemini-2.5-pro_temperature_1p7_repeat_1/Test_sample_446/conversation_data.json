    "Of the choices provided, the peptide **RGDSPSS** has been found to bind or is highly likely to bind to an integrin receptor in an in vitro assay.\n\nThe RGD (Arginine-Glycine-Aspartic acid) sequence is a well-established and the most common peptide motif that integrin receptors on the surface of cells recognize and bind to. This interaction is fundamental for cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix.\n\nThe peptide in choice B, RGDSPSS, contains the core sequence RGDSP. This sequence is part of the extensively studied and commercially available peptide GRGDSP (Glycine-Arginine-Glycine-Aspartic acid-Serine-Proline). Numerous in vitro studies have utilized GRGDSP as a ligand to study integrin binding and function. For example, GRGDSP has been used in competitive inhibition assays to demonstrate the RGD-dependence of cell adhesion to fibronectin. The crystal structure of an integrin in complex with the GRGDSP peptide has also been solved, providing detailed insight into the binding interaction at a molecular level. In such assays, synthetic peptides like GRGDSP are used to compete with extracellular matrix proteins for binding to integrins, thereby inhibiting cell adhesion.\n\nWhile no specific in vitro assay was found for the exact RGDSPSS sequence, the presence of the recognized RGDSP binding motif makes it a highly probable ligand for integrin receptors. The flanking amino acids of the core RGD sequence are known to influence the specificity and affinity of the binding to different integrin subtypes. Given that GRGDSP is a known integrin binder in in vitro assays, RGDSPSS is the most likely candidate among the options provided.\n\nThe other peptides listed, while containing the RGD motif, are not as commonly cited as established ligands in the provided search results for in vitro integrin binding assays.\n\n<<<B>>>"
