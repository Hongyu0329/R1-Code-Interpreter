Here are the equations for the absorption cross-section within the first-order time-dependent perturbation theory for transitions originating from occupied molecular orbitals, induced by an ultrashort Gaussian-shaped laser pulse.

**General Parameters:**
*   **Laser Pulse Electric Field:**  $ \mathbf{E}(t) = \mathbf{E}_0 e^{-t^2/2\tau^2} \cos(\omega_0 t) $
*   **Interaction Hamiltonian:** $ H'(t) = -\mathbf{d} \cdot \mathbf{E}(t) $
*   **Lineshape Function (from Gaussian pulse):** $ g(\Delta E) = \frac{\tau}{\hbar\sqrt{2\pi}} \exp\left(-\frac{(\Delta E \cdot \tau)^2}{2\hbar^2}\right) $, where $ \Delta E $ is the energy difference between the final and initial states minus the photon energy.
*   **Initial state:** An occupied molecular orbital, $|i\rangle = |\phi_{occ}\rangle$.

**a) The interaction between molecules can be neglected.**

In this scenario, the molecules in the chain are independent. The total absorption cross-section is the sum of the cross-sections of the individual N molecules.

*   **Initial State Energy:** $ E_i = \epsilon_{occ} $ (energy of the occupied molecular orbital)
*   **Final State:** An unoccupied molecular orbital, $ |f\rangle = |\phi_{unocc}\rangle $
*   **Final State Energy:** $ E_f = \epsilon_{unocc} $
*   **Transition Dipole Moment:** $ \mathbf{d}_{fi} = \langle\phi_{unocc}|\mathbf{d}|\phi_{occ}\rangle $

The absorption cross-section for the chain of N molecules is:
$ \sigma_a(\omega) = N \frac{4\pi^2\alpha_0\hbar\omega}{3} |\mathbf{d}_{fi}|^2 g(\epsilon_{unocc} - \epsilon_{occ} - \hbar\omega) $

where $ \alpha_0 $ is the fine-structure constant.

**b) The interaction between near-neighbors should be considered.**

Here, the molecular orbitals of neighboring molecules interact, forming delocalized exciton states. We use a tight-binding model for a chain of N molecules with near-neighbor coupling *J*.

*   **Unperturbed Hamiltonian (for the excited states):** $ H_0 = \sum_{n=1}^{N} \epsilon |n\rangle\langle n| + \sum_{n=1}^{N-1} J (|n\rangle\langle n+1| + |n+1\rangle\langle n|) $
*   **Initial State:** The ground state of the chain, $|i\rangle = |\text{Ground}\rangle$, with energy $ E_i = E_{\text{Ground}} $.
*   **Final States:** Delocalized one-exciton states, $ |f\rangle = |\Psi_k\rangle = \sqrt{\frac{2}{N+1}} \sum_{n=1}^{N} \sin(kn) |n\rangle $.
*   **Final State Energies:** $ E_f = E_k = \epsilon + 2J \cos(k) $, with $ k = \frac{m\pi}{N+1} $ for $ m = 1, 2, ..., N $.
*   **Transition Dipole Moment (for transition to state k):** $ \mathbf{D}_{ki} = \langle\Psi_k|\sum_{n=1}^N \mathbf{d}_n|\text{Ground}\rangle $

The absorption cross-section is a sum over transitions to all possible exciton states:
$ \sigma_b(\omega) = \sum_{k} \frac{4\pi^2\alpha_0\hbar\omega}{3} |\mathbf{D}_{ki}|^2 g(E_k - E_{\text{Ground}} - \hbar\omega) $

The interaction concentrates the absorption strength into specific exciton states, governed by selection rules dependent on the symmetry of the states and the orientation of the molecular dipoles. For a chain with parallel dipoles, only transitions to states with odd *m* are typically allowed, with the m=1 state having the largest intensity.
