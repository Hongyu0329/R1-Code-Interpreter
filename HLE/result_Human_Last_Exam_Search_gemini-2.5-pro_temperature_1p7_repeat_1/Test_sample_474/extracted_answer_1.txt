The proposed research approach is not valid because human visual perception, especially that of untrained individuals, is not an adequate proxy for the visual perception of the primary predators of bumblebees (mainly birds). The ecological function of mimicry is determined by the predator's ability to see and learn warning signals. Since birds can perceive ultraviolet light—a spectrum invisible to humans but present in bumblebee coloration—the similarity rankings provided by undergraduates would likely fail to capture the true, functional mimicry syndromes that have evolved under the selective pressure of predation.
