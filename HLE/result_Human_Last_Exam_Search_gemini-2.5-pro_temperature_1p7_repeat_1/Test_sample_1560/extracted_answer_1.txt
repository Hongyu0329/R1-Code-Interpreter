The final state of the system after measurement depends on which scenario is being considered.

**Scenario 1: Single Ququint with Gate Q**

After applying the gate $Q$ to the initial state $|\psi\rangle$ and subsequently performing a measurement, the system collapses from its superposition into one of the five basis states. The final state is not a superposition but a single basis state. The specific outcome is probabilistic:
*   The final state is $|0\rangle$ with a probability of **2/11**.
*   The final state is $|1\rangle$ with a probability of **2/11**.
*   The final state is $|2\rangle$ with a probability of **9/22**.
*   The final state is $|3\rangle$ with a probability of **2/11**.
*   The final state is $|4\rangle$ with a probability of **1/22**.

**Scenario 2: Entangled Ququints**

After measuring one of the entangled ququints (e.g., ququint A), the entanglement is broken, and the entire system collapses to a single, non-superposed state.
If the measurement on ququint A results in the state $|i\rangle_A$ (where $i$ can be any integer from 0 to 4), the final state of the combined system is definitively $|\Psi_{final}\rangle = |i\rangle_A \otimes |i\rangle_B$. This means the state of ququint B is also determined to be $|i\rangle_B$.

Each of the five possible final states ($|0\rangle_A \otimes |0\rangle_B$, $|1\rangle_A \otimes |1\rangle_B$, etc.) has a uniform probability of **1/5** of being the outcome.
