    "The reaction between butadiene and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene results in a mixture of products from two different types of chemical reactions known as cycloadditions. These reactions involve the joining of the two molecules to form cyclic compounds. The two primary cycloaddition pathways are:\n\n**1. [4+2] Cycloaddition (Diels-Alder Reaction)**\nIn this pathway, the four-carbon butadiene molecule (in its *s-cis* conformation) reacts with the two-carbon double bond of 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene to form a six-membered ring. This is a classic example of a Diels-Alder reaction. The product of this reaction is:\n*   **4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohexene**\n\n**2. [2+2] Cycloaddition**\nThis pathway involves one of the double bonds of butadiene reacting with the double bond of 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene to form a four-membered ring. This type of reaction is common with halogenated ethylenes like 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene. The product of this reaction is a substituted cyclobutane:\n*   **1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoro-3-vinylcyclobutane**\n\nReactions involving fluoroalkenes often proceed through a diradical intermediate, which can then lead to either the [2+2] or the [4+2] product. Therefore, a mixture of both the cyclohexene and the vinylcyclobutane derivatives is typically formed.\n\nIn similar reactions, such as butadiene with tetrafluoroethylene, the [2+2] cycloaddition product is favored under kinetic control (lower temperatures), while the [4+2] Diels-Alder product is favored under thermodynamic control (higher temperatures).\n\n<<<The reaction between butadiene and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene produces a mixture of **4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohexene** (from a [4+2] cycloaddition) and **1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoro-3-vinylcyclobutane** (from a [2+2] cycloaddition)."
