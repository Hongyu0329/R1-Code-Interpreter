Based on the information, here are the key counseling recommendations:

1.  **Headache as a Side Effect:** Inform Allison that headache can be a common side effect of all three of her new medications (Atorvastatin, Junel Fe, and Fluoxetine), and it may resolve as her body adjusts.

2.  **Excedrin (Aspirin) and Fluoxetine Interaction:** Counsel her on the increased risk of bleeding when taking aspirin-containing products like Excedrin with Fluoxetine. Recommend an alternative like acetaminophen (Tylenol) for future headaches and advise her to watch for signs of bleeding (e.g., easy bruising, dark stools) and to contact her doctor if she notices any.

3.  **Atorvastatin Interactions:**
    *   Inform her that Fluoxetine can increase the level of Atorvastatin, so she should report any unexplained muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness to her doctor, as these could be signs of a serious side effect.
    *   Mention that Atorvastatin can increase the hormone levels from her Junel Fe, which might increase side effects from the birth control.
    *   As a standard counseling point for Atorvastatin, advise her to avoid consuming grapefruit or grapefruit juice, as it can increase the risk of side effects.

4.  **Managing Headaches and Triggers:** Briefly explain that strong smells can sometimes trigger headaches, like in her case with the scent of seawater. If headaches persist, she should discuss them with her doctor to rule out other causes and to ensure her medications are the right fit for her.

5.  **Caffeine Intake:** Note that the caffeine in Excedrin can potentially lead to increased side effects like nervousness or sleeplessness when taken with birth control pills like Junel Fe.
