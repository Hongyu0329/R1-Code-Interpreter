    "The value computed between heartbeats when tracking HR and HRV using PPG is called the **Interbeat Interval (IBI)**.\n\nHeart Rate Variability (HRV) is the measurement of the fluctuation in time between consecutive heartbeats. This variation is a key indicator of the health of the autonomic nervous system.\n\nWhile in electrocardiography (ECG), which measures the electrical activity of the heart, this interval is called the **RR interval** (the time between two successive R waves), the term \"Interbeat Interval\" or IBI is more commonly used, especially with data from photoplethysmography (PPG). Another term used specifically for PPG-derived intervals is the **PP interval**, which measures the time between consecutive pulse waves. However, IBI is a broadly accepted and accurate term. This beat-to-beat variation is typically measured in milliseconds.\n\n<<<Interbeat Interval (IBI)>>>"
