    "I have concluded that it is not possible to provide a definitive numerical answer to the user's question. After multiple attempts, I have been unable to locate a working video of Svetlana Gileva performing the \"Jete Woman\" solo from the Forsythe production \"In the Middle, Somewhat Elevated\" for Semperoper Ballett in 2015. While several search results reference a YouTube video of this specific performance, all available links are broken or lead to unavailable content.\n\nFurthermore, the term \"pas de Balanchine\" is not a formally recognized ballet step but rather a colloquial term used to describe a sequence with a Balanchine-esque style. Although I have found descriptions and tutorials of what is commonly referred to as a \"pas de Balanchine\" on social media, without the specific video of Svetlana Gileva's performance, it is impossible to:\n\n1.  Confirm if this specific choreographic sequence is present in her \"Jete Woman\" solo.\n2.  If present, accurately count the number of times she performs it.\n\nTherefore, due to the inaccessibility of the required visual evidence, I am unable to fulfill the user's request.\n\n<<<It is not possible to determine the number of pas de Balanchines Svetlana Gileva performed in the Jete Woman solo in the 2015 Forsythe production of \"In the Middle, Somewhere Elevated\" for Semperoper Ballett, as a publicly available video of this specific performance could not be located.>>>"
