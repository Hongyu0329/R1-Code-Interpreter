    "A total of **52** irreducible representations (irreps) of the symmetric group on 25 elements, $S_{25}$, have a dimension strictly less than 500,000.\n\nThe irreducible representations of the symmetric group $S_n$ are in one-to-one correspondence with the partitions of the integer $n$. For $S_{25}$, we consider partitions of 25. The dimension of each irrep can be calculated using the hook length formula. An analysis of these dimensions reveals the following partitions and their corresponding irreps with dimensions below the specified threshold.\n\nThe dimensions are determined by the shape of the Young diagram corresponding to the partition. Generally, partitions that are \"long\" or \"thin\" (those with a very large first part, or many small parts) correspond to lower-dimensional representations.\n\nBelow is a list of the 26 partitions, $\\lambda$, that result in an irrep dimension of less than 500,000. Each of these partitions is not self-conjugate, meaning its corresponding Young diagram is not symmetric. The conjugate partition, $\\lambda'$, corresponds to an irrep of the same dimension. Therefore, each partition listed represents a pair of irreps, doubling the total count.\n\n**Partitions with the largest part being 25 down to 22:**\n*   **$\\lambda_1=25$:** The partition (25) has a dimension of 1. Its conjugate, (1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1) or $(1^{25})$, also has a dimension of 1.\n*   **$\\lambda_1=24$:** The partition (24,1) corresponds to an irrep of dimension 24. Its conjugate, $(2,1^{23})$, also has a dimension of 24.\n*   **$\\lambda_1=23$:** The partitions (23,2) and $(23,1^2)$ have dimensions of 275 and 276, respectively. Their conjugates, $(2^2,1^{21})$ and $(3,1^{22})$, have the same dimensions.\n*   **$\\lambda_1=22$:** Partitions (22,3), $(22,1^3)$, and (22,2,1) result in dimensions of 2000, 2024, and 2275.\n\n**Partitions with the largest part being 21:**\n*   (21,4): 10,350\n*   $(21,1^4)$: 10,626\n*   (21,3,1): 12,650\n*   (21,2,2): 12,825\n\n**Partitions with the largest part being 20:**\n*   (20,5): 40,480\n*   $(20,1^5)$: 42,504\n*   (20,4,1): 48,875\n*   (20,3,2): 55,250\n*   $(20,2,1^3)$: 58,125\n\n**Partitions with the largest part being 19:**\n*   (19,6): 123,970\n*   $(19,1^6)$: 134,596\n*   (19,5,1): 151,470\n*   (19,4,2): 184,425\n*   (19,3,3): 202,400\n*   (19,3,2,1): 226,425\n\n**Partitions with the largest part being 18:**\n*   (18,7): 303,600\n*   $(18,1^7)$: 346,104\n*   (18,6,1): 411,075\n*   (18,5,2): 480,700\n\nPartitions where the largest part is 17 or less all yield irreducible representations with dimensions greater than 500,000. Additionally, all self-conjugate partitions of 25 result in dimensions exceeding this threshold.\n\nIn total, there are 26 such partitions. Since none of them are self-conjugate, each corresponds to a distinct irrep, and so does its conjugate partition. This gives a total of $26 \\times 2 = 52$ irreducible representations with dimensions strictly less than 500,000.\n\n<<<52>>>"
