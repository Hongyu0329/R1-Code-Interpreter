    "Let $X$ be a smooth quintic hypersurface in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$. This means $X$ is a 2-dimensional complex manifold (and a 4-dimensional real manifold) defined by a degree-5 homogeneous polynomial in the complex projective space $\\mathbb{CP}^3$. We want to find the rank of its third homotopy group, $\\pi_3(X)$.\n\nThe rank of an abelian group is the dimension of the vector space obtained by tensoring the group with the field of rational numbers, $\\mathbb{Q}$. This means we are looking for the number of copies of $\\mathbb{Z}$ in the free part of the abelian group $\\pi_3(X)$.\n\nA detailed analysis using the tools of algebraic topology, such as the long exact sequence of a pair and the Hurewicz theorem, allows for a rational computation of the homotopy group. The key steps are:\n1.  The long exact sequence of homotopy for the pair $( \\mathbb{CP}^3, X)$ relates the homotopy groups of $X$, $\\mathbb{CP}^3$, and the relative homotopy groups $\\pi_k(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X)$.\n2.  The homotopy groups of complex projective space $\\mathbb{CP}^n$ are well-known for low dimensions. In particular, using the Hopf fibration $S^1 \\to S^7 \\to \\mathbb{CP}^3$, we can establish that $\\pi_3(\\mathbb{CP}^3) \\cong \\pi_3(S^7) = 0$ and $\\pi_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3) \\cong \\pi_4(S^7) = 0$.\n3.  The Lefschetz hyperplane theorem implies that the relative homotopy groups $\\pi_k(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X)$ are trivial for $k \\le 2$. A more detailed analysis shows that the pair is 3-connected.\n4.  The relative Hurewicz theorem can then be applied, which provides an isomorphism between the fourth relative homotopy group and the fourth relative homology group: $\\pi_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X) \\cong H_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X; \\mathbb{Z})$.\n5.  By the Thom isomorphism, the relative homology group $H_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X; \\mathbb{Z})$ is isomorphic to the second homology group of the hypersurface itself, $H_2(X; \\mathbb{Z})$.\n6.  The Lefschetz hyperplane theorem for homology states that $H_2(X; \\mathbb{Z})$ is isomorphic to $H_2(\\mathbb{CP}^3; \\mathbb{Z})$, which is known to be the group of integers, $\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nCombining these steps, a rational calculation shows that $\\pi_3(X) \\otimes \\mathbb{Q} \\cong \\mathbb{Q}$. The dimension of this vector space over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is 1.\n\nMore advanced results from W.S. Lam establish the full structure of the homotopy group. For a smooth hypersurface $X$ of complex dimension $n=2$ and degree $d=5$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^{3}$, the third homotopy group is given by:\n$\\pi_3(X) \\cong \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_5$.\n\nThe rank of this group is determined by its free part, which is $\\mathbb{Z}$. Therefore, the rank is 1.\n\n<<<1>>>"
