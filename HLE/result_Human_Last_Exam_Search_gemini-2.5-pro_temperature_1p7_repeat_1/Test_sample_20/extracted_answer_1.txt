Yes, it is true that the Wasserstein regular subgradient of the functional $J(\mu) = \frac{1}{2}W_2(\mu,\nu)^2$ is the trivial tangent vector at the minimum of $J$.

Here is a step-by-step justification:

### 1. The Wasserstein Space and the Functional J
We are working in the Wasserstein space $\mathcal{P}_2(\mathbb{R}^d)$, which is the space of probability measures on $\mathbb{R}^d$ with a finite second moment, equipped with the 2-Wasserstein distance, $W_2$. This space has a differential structure, allowing for concepts like tangent spaces and gradients.

The functional in question is $J(\mu) = \frac{1}{2}W_2(\mu,\nu)^2$, where $\nu$ is a fixed probability measure in $\mathcal{P}_2(\mathbb{R}^d)$.

### 2. The Minimum of the Functional
The Wasserstein distance $W_2(\mu, \nu)$ is non-negative and is zero if and only if $\mu = \nu$. Therefore, the functional $J(\mu)$ has a unique minimum at $\mu = \nu$, where $J(\nu) = \frac{1}{2}W_2(\nu,\nu)^2 = 0$.

### 3. Tangent Space and Subgradients
The tangent space at a point $\mu \in \mathcal{P}_2(\mathbb{R}^d)$, denoted $T_\mu\mathcal{P}_2(\mathbb{R}^d)$, can be identified with a subspace of the Hilbert space $L^2(\mu; \mathbb{R}^d)$ of square-integrable vector fields on $\mathbb{R}^d$ with respect to the measure $\mu$. The "trivial tangent vector" at any point $\mu$ is the zero element of this space, which is the vector field that is zero everywhere.

For a functional $F: \mathcal{P}_2(\mathbb{R}^d) \to \mathbb{R}$, its subdifferential at $\mu$, denoted $\partial F(\mu)$, is a set of tangent vectors in $T_\mu\mathcal{P}_2(\mathbb{R}^d)$ that characterize the "slope" of the functional. A recent article clarifies that a "regular subgradient" is an element of the subdifferential that lies within the tangent space. For a convex functional, a point is a minimum if and only if the zero vector is an element of its subdifferential at that point.

### 4. The Subgradient of *J* at its Minimum
The functional $J(\mu)$ is known to be geodesically convex. We want to find its subdifferential, $\partial J(\mu)$, at the minimum point $\mu = \nu$.

Let $\xi \in \partial J(\nu)$. By the definition of the subgradient, for any other measure $\sigma \in \mathcal{P}_2(\mathbb{R}^d)$, the following inequality must hold:
$J(\sigma) \ge J(\nu) + \langle \xi, v \rangle_{L^2(\nu)} W_2(\sigma, \nu) + o(W_2(\sigma, \nu))$
where $v$ is the initial velocity vector of the geodesic from $\nu$ to $\sigma$.

Since $J(\nu)=0$, this simplifies to:
$\frac{1}{2}W_2(\sigma, \nu)^2 \ge \langle \xi, v \rangle_{L^2(\nu)} W_2(\sigma, \nu) + o(W_2(\sigma, \nu))$

Dividing by $W_2(\sigma, \nu)$ (for $\sigma \neq \nu$) gives:
$\frac{1}{2}W_2(\sigma, \nu) \ge \langle \xi, v \rangle_{L^2(\nu)} + o(1)$

Taking the limit as $\sigma$ approaches $\nu$ (so $W_2(\sigma, \nu) \to 0$), we get:
$0 \ge \langle \xi, v \rangle_{L^2(\nu)}$

This inequality must hold for any tangent vector $v \in T_\nu\mathcal{P}_2(\mathbb{R}^d)$, as any such vector can be realized as the initial velocity of some geodesic starting at $\nu$. Since the tangent space is a vector space, we can replace $v$ with $-v$ and obtain the opposite inequality:
$0 \ge \langle \xi, -v \rangle_{L^2(\nu)} \implies 0 \le \langle \xi, v \rangle_{L^2(\nu)}$

Combining the two inequalities, we must have $\langle \xi, v \rangle_{L^2(\nu)} = 0$ for all $v \in T_\nu\mathcal{P}_2(\mathbb{R}^d)$. Since the inner product is non-degenerate, this implies that $\xi$ must be the zero vector field.

Therefore, the subdifferential of $J$ at its minimum $\mu = \nu$ contains only the trivial tangent vector: $\partial J(\nu) = \{0\}$. This unique element is thus the regular subgradient.

This conclusion is also consistent with the known formula for the gradient of $J$. The gradient of $J$ at a point $\mu$ (where it is differentiable) is the vector field $v(x) = T(x) - x$, where $T$ is the optimal transport map that pushes $\mu$ forward to $\nu$. At the minimum, $\mu=\nu$, the optimal transport map is simply the identity map, $T(x)=x$. Thus, the gradient vector field is $v(x) = x - x = 0$.
