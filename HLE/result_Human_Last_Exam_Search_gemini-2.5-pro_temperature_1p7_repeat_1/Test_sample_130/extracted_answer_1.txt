The edges of the binary image will become smoother by rounding off sharp corners and eliminating small, thin features. The boundaries between black and white regions will move and simplify, evolving in a manner analogous to mean curvature flow, to reduce their overall length. This iterative process will eventually converge to a "fixed point" or "root" image, which is invariant to further applications of the median filter. The final shapes in the image will be geometrically simpler and "convex" with respect to the filter, meaning they have smooth, rounded boundaries.
