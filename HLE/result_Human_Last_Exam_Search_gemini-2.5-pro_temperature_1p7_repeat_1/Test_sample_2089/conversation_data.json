    "The Oscar-nominated film in which a character's fate is sealed as they are on a bus is **Midnight Cowboy**. In the final scenes of the movie, Joe Buck is on a bus with his friend Enrico \"Ratso\" Rizzo, heading to Miami. Ratso, who has been ill throughout the film, dies on the bus.\n\nThe 1969 film was nominated for seven Academy Awards and won three, including Best Picture, Best Director for John Schlesinger, and Best Adapted Screenplay for Waldo Salt. The film is notable for being the only X-rated movie to ever win the Best Picture Oscar. Jon Voight was nominated for Best Actor for his role as Joe Buck, and Dustin Hoffman was nominated for Best Actor for his portrayal of Ratso Rizzo.\n\nIn the poignant final sequence of the film, as they are on the bus to Florida, Joe Buck tells Ratso that he plans to get a regular job once they arrive. When Ratso doesn't respond, Joe realizes his friend has passed away. The bus driver asks Joe to close Ratso's eyelids, and the film ends with Joe putting his arm around his deceased friend as the bus continues toward Miami.\n\n<<<Midnight Cowboy>>>"
