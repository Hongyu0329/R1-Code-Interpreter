    "The fictitious molecule \"mercedesbenzene\" is a chemistry joke, and its structure is represented by 1,3,5-triethylbenzene. This compound consists of a central benzene ring to which three ethyl groups are attached.\n\nThe benzene ring itself contains 6 carbon atoms. Each of the three ethyl groups (–CH₂CH₃) contains 2 carbon atoms.\n\nTherefore, the total number of carbon atoms in mercedesbenzene (1,3,5-triethylbenzene) is calculated as follows:\n\n6 (from the benzene ring) + 3 * 2 (from the three ethyl groups) = 12 carbon atoms.\n\nThe chemical formula for 1,3,5-triethylbenzene is C₁₂H₁₈.\n\n<<<12>>>"
