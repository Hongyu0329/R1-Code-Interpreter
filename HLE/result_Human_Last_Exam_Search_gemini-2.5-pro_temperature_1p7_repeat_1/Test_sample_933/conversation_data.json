    "The direct synthesis of xenon tetrafluoride (XeF4) from its elements, xenon and fluorine, is highly dependent on temperature. The efficiency of the production is a balance, as different temperatures favor the formation of other xenon fluorides.\n\nThe most widely cited and effective method for producing XeF4 involves heating a mixture of xenon and fluorine gas, typically in a 1:5 molar ratio, in a nickel vessel to 400°C. This process operates at a pressure of about 6 atmospheres. A patent for this process specifies a temperature range of 350°C to 450°C, with 400°C being the preferable temperature to achieve a yield of 100% with respect to the amount of xenon used.\n\nControlling the temperature is crucial because a mixture of xenon difluoride (XeF2), xenon tetrafluoride (XeF4), and xenon hexafluoride (XeF6) exist in chemical equilibrium. Lower temperatures tend to favor the production of XeF2, while higher temperatures and an excess of fluorine favor the formation of XeF6. Therefore, temperatures significantly lower than 400°C are less efficient for producing XeF4 and may lead to a higher proportion of XeF2 in the final product.\n\nWhile other methods exist, such as using an electric discharge or photochemical reactions, the thermal method at 400°C is the standard for efficient synthesis of XeF4 with high purity. For example, a Russian patent describes a combustion-based synthesis where the reactor wall is heated to 70-80°C, but this requires an initiator heated to 650–700 °C to start the reaction.\n\nBased on the available synthesis methods, 400°C is the coldest temperature at which Xenon tetrafluoride can be reliably and efficiently produced.\n\n<<<B>>>"
