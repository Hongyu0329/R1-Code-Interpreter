    "## Ontario: The Nearest Neighbor to Waskaganish Gathering Place\n\nThe closest province to the Waskaganish gathering place, located in the Cree community of Waskaganish in Quebec, is Ontario. Geographically, Waskaganish sits on the southeastern shore of James Bay, and the province of Ontario lies directly to the west and south, across the bay.\n\nWaskaganish is a significant location for the Cree Nation, situated at the mouth of the Rupert River in the Eeyou Istchee James Bay region of Quebec. The traditional territory of the Cree, known as \"Eeyou Istchee,\" historically spans across the regions of what is now modern-day northern Quebec and Ontario, highlighting the deep-rooted connection and proximity between the two areas.\n\nWhile the islands within James Bay are politically part of the territory of Nunavut, the mainland of Ontario is geographically the nearest provincial body to Waskaganish. This proximity is evident on maps of the region, which show the close relationship between the Quebec community and the Ontario border across the southern expanse of the bay.\n\n<<<Ontario>>>"
