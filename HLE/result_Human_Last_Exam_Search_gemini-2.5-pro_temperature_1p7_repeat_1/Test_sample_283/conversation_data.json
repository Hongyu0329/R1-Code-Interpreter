    "An understanding of the structure of a Hierarchical Semi-separable (HSS) matrix and the algorithm for matrix multiplication is necessary to determine the number of submatrices accessed. An HSS representation of a matrix is built upon a hierarchical partitioning of the matrix, which can be visualized using a tree structure, typically a binary tree. Matrix operations, such as multiplication, are performed by traversing this tree in what usually constitutes an upward and a downward pass.\n\nThe submatrices accessed during multiplication are the \"generator\" matrices that define the HSS structure. For a standard HSS matrix representation corresponding to a binary tree, these generators are:\n*   **D-matrices:** Dense submatrices corresponding to the diagonal blocks at the lowest level (the leaves) of the hierarchy.\n*   **U- and V-matrices:** Basis matrices used to compress the off-diagonal blocks, associated with each node in the tree.\n*   **B-matrices:** Coupling matrices that represent the interaction between sibling blocks in the hierarchy, associated with each parent (non-leaf) node.\n\nTo calculate the total number of these submatrices, we can analyze the structure of a full binary tree of a given depth. A tree of depth 4 has five levels of nodes (from level 0, the root, to level 4, the leaves).\n\nFor a tree of depth 4, we have:\n*   **Levels:** 0, 1, 2, 3, 4.\n*   **Leaf Nodes:** These are at level 4. The number of leaf nodes is `2^4 = 16`. Each leaf node stores one **D-matrix**. This gives a total of 16 D-matrices.\n*   **Total Nodes:** The total number of nodes in a full binary tree of depth 4 is `2^(4+1) - 1 = 31`. Each of these 31 nodes has a **U-matrix** and a **V-matrix**. This results in 31 U-matrices and 31 V-matrices.\n*   **Non-Leaf Nodes:** These are the nodes from level 0 to 3, totaling `2^4 - 1 = 15`. Each non-leaf node is a parent to a pair of sibling nodes. The interaction between these two siblings is described by two **B-matrices** (e.g., `B_12` and `B_21`). Therefore, each of the 15 non-leaf nodes accounts for 2 B-matrices, giving a total of `15 * 2 = 30` B-matrices.\n\nThe HSS multiplication algorithm is designed to utilize all these stored generator matrices. Therefore, the total number of submatrices accessed is the sum of all these generator matrices.\n\nTotal submatrices accessed = (Number of D-matrices) + (Number of U-matrices) + (Number of V-matrices) + (Number of B-matrices)\nTotal = 16 + 31 + 31 + 30 = 108.\n\n<<<108>>>"
