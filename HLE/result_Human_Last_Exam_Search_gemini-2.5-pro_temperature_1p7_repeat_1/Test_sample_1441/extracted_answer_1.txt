In scalar field theory, for dimensionalities *d* below the upper critical dimension of four, the specific heat critical exponent, α, scales with the spatial dimensionality according to the relation α = 2 - ν*d*, where ν is the correlation length exponent. Utilizing the epsilon expansion (ε = 4 - *d*), the scaling of ν for an O(n)-symmetric model is given to one-loop order by ν ≈ 1/2 + [(n+2)/(4(n+8))]ε. This leads to a quantitative scaling for α to first order in ε as:

α ≈ [(4 - n) / (2(n+8))]ε

This expression shows that the scaling of α depends on both the deviation of the dimensionality from four and the number of components (*n*) of the scalar field. Higher-order corrections in ε provide a more refined quantitative scaling.
