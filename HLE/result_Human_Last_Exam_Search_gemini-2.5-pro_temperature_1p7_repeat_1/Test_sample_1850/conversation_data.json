    "John Miltonâ€™s epic poem *Paradise Lost* mentions only one historical saint by name: Saint Peter. Additionally, the poem names two Old Testament figures, Enoch and Elijah, who were \"translated\" to Heaven and are considered saints in many Christian traditions.\n\nThe single explicit mention of a post-biblical historical saint occurs in a satirical passage in Book III. Here, Milton critiques the Catholic Church's practice of venerating relics and the idea of a \"Paradise of Fools,\" a limbo for vain and foolish things. In this context, he mentions those who believe they can enter heaven through superficial acts of faith, imagining \"Saint Peter at Heav'ns Wicket\" waiting with his keys. This reference is not one of veneration but rather serves a critical purpose in line with Milton's own Puritan beliefs, which were skeptical of the worship of saints.\n\nThe poem also makes reference to the biblical figures Enoch and Elijah, who are considered \"translated saints\" because they were taken to heaven without dying. In Book XI, the archangel Michael shows Adam a vision of the future of mankind, which includes the story of Enoch. This vision highlights Enoch's righteousness in a corrupt world. Similarly, there are allusions to the story of the prophet Elijah being taken to heaven in a chariot of fire.\n\nWhile the theological influence of Saint Augustine on *Paradise Lost* is significant, particularly his ideas on the Fall and original sin as detailed in his work *The City of God*, Augustine is not mentioned by name within the poem itself.\n\nTherefore, to be precise, while other saintly figures are alluded to, only Saint Peter is explicitly named as a historical saint. Enoch and Elijah are named as pre-Christian, Old Testament figures who are considered saints through their translation to heaven.\n\n<<<1>>>"
