    "The symmetry factor of a Feynman diagram is a crucial element in perturbative calculations within quantum field theory. It represents the order of the automorphism group of the diagram, which is the number of ways the internal lines and vertices can be permuted without changing the diagram's overall structure and connections of external lines.\n\nThe question specifies a Feynman diagram with the following characteristics:\n*   **Two vertices:** The diagram is constructed from two interaction points.\n*   **Four field contractions:** In the context of Green's function analysis, a \"field contraction\" corresponds to a propagator (an internal line) that connects two spacetime points (vertices). Therefore, this diagram has four internal lines.\n\nFor a diagram to have two vertices and four internal lines, and for it to be a connected diagram commonly found in perturbation theory, the vertices must be of at least order 4 (i.e., have four lines attached). The most common context for this is the **φ⁴ theory**, where the interaction Lagrangian has a term proportional to φ⁴, and each vertex connects four fields.\n\nThe diagram in question is a vacuum diagram where the two vertices are connected to each other by all four propagators. No external lines are present.\n\nThe symmetry factor, denoted by *S*, can be calculated by identifying the permutations of the diagram's components that leave it unchanged:\n\n1.  **Permutation of Internal Lines:** The four propagators connecting the two vertices are identical. They can be permuted among themselves in 4! (4 factorial) ways without altering the diagram.\n    *   4! = 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 24\n\n2.  **Permutation of Vertices:** The two vertices are also identical. They can be interchanged, and the diagram will remain topologically the same. This contributes a factor of 2! (2 factorial).\n    *   2! = 2 × 1 = 2\n\nThe total symmetry factor is the product of these independent symmetry operations. A general rule states that for a pair of vertices joined by *n* propagators, there is a symmetry factor of *n*!. Additionally, if the two vertices themselves can be swapped, this introduces another factor.\n\nTherefore, for this specific diagram, the symmetry factor is:\n\n*S* = (Number of permutations of internal lines) × (Number of permutations of vertices)\n*S* = 4! × 2!\n*S* = 24 × 2\n*S* = 48\n\nThis result is consistent with calculations from the Dyson series expansion, where the overall numerical factor for the diagram is (1/S). This factor arises from the (1/n!) term for an n-th order calculation and the (1/V!) term for each vertex of order V, multiplied by the number of Wick contractions that form the diagram. For a two-vertex (n=2) vacuum diagram in φ⁴ theory (V=4), the combinatorial factors from the perturbative series are (1/2!) from the expansion of the exponential and (1/4!)² from the two vertices. The number of ways to connect the four legs of one vertex to the four legs of the other is 4!. The overall factor is thus (1/2!) × (1/4!)² × 4! = 1/48. The denominator, 48, is the symmetry factor.\n\n<<<48>>>"
