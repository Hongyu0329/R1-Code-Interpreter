    "The allusion to the Roman myth of Romulus and Remus in William Morris's *The House of the Wolfings* is not made by a character who has visited a Roman city. Instead, the connection is woven into the narrative by the omniscient narrator, who highlights the irony of the Romans, with their own wolf-centered foundation story, persecuting a people known as the Wolfings.\n\nWhile the novel features characters who have been captives of the Romans, such as a \"man of the Gael\" who was enslaved in a Roman city, this character does not explicitly describe Roman religious practices or the tale of Romulus and Remus.\n\nThe reference is more of a symbolic and thematic one, where the shared wolf emblem serves to contrast the two cultures. A scholarly analysis of the novel notes that the Romans' imperialistic actions against the Goths are underscored by the fact that they are, in a sense, denying the Wolfings their own totemic identityâ€”an identity that mirrors the Romans' own founding myth. The narrative emphasizes the hypocrisy of the Romans, who revere the she-wolf that suckled their founders, Romulus and Remus, while simultaneously seeking to conquer a people who also hold the wolf as a central symbol. This observation, however, is presented through the authorial voice of the narrator, rather than being a direct account from a character within the story.\n\nTherefore, no specific character who has visited a Roman city describes the religious practices in a way that directly alludes to Romulus and Remus. The allusion is a literary device employed by the author to add a layer of historical irony to the conflict between the two peoples.\n\n<<<No specific character makes this reference; it is an observation made by the narrator.>>>"
