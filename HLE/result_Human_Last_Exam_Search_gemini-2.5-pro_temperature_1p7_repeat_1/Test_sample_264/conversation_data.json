    "The problem asks for the volume of the intersection of two cubes, each with a side length of 1. One cube is shifted relative to the other by a distance of 1/2 along the main diagonal.\n\nTo solve this, let's first define the coordinate system and the cubes.\n\nLet the first cube, C1, be defined by the set of points (x, y, z) where `0 ≤ x ≤ 1`, `0 ≤ y ≤ 1`, and `0 ≤ z ≤ 1`. This is a standard unit cube.\n\nThe main diagonal of this cube connects the origin (0, 0, 0) to the opposite corner (1, 1, 1). The direction vector of this diagonal is **d** = (1, 1, 1). The length of this diagonal is ||**d**|| = √(1² + 1² + 1²) = √3.\n\nThe problem states that the second cube, C2, is shifted by a distance of 1/2 along this main diagonal. This means the center of the second cube is displaced by a vector of length 1/2 in the direction of the main diagonal.\n\nThe unit vector in the direction of the main diagonal is **u** = **d** / ||**d**|| = (1/√3, 1/√3, 1/√3).\n\nThe shift vector, **v**, is therefore:\n**v** = (1/2) * **u** = (1/2) * (1/√3, 1/√3, 1/√3) = (1/(2√3), 1/(2√3), 1/(2√3)).\n\nThe second cube, C2, is a translation of the first cube by this vector **v**. So, for a point (x', y', z') to be in C2, the original point (x' - 1/(2√3), y' - 1/(2√3), z' - 1/(2√3)) must be in C1. This gives us the inequalities for C2:\n`1/(2√3) ≤ x' ≤ 1 + 1/(2√3)`\n`1/(2√3) ≤ y' ≤ 1 + 1/(2√3)`\n`1/(2√3) ≤ z' ≤ 1 + 1/(2√3)`\n\nThe volume of the intersection is the volume of the region where a point (x, y, z) satisfies the conditions for both C1 and C2. We need to find the intersection of the coordinate intervals for both cubes. Let `s = 1/(2√3)`.\n\n*   **For the x-coordinate:** The interval for C1 is and for C2 is [s, 1+s]. The intersection of these two intervals is [s, 1]. The length of this intersection is `1 - s = 1 - 1/(2√3)`.\n*   **For the y-coordinate:** Similarly, the intersection of and [s, 1+s] is [s, 1], with a length of `1 - s = 1 - 1/(2√3)`.\n*   **For the z-coordinate:** Again, the intersection of and [s, 1+s] is [s, 1], with a length of `1 - s = 1 - 1/(2√3)`.\n\nThe intersection of the two cubes is a smaller cube whose sides have a length of `1 - 1/(2√3)`. The volume of this intersection is the cube of its side length:\nVolume = `(1 - 1/(2√3))^3`\n\nTo simplify the expression inside the parenthesis:\n`1 - 1/(2√3) = 1 - √3/6 = (6 - √3) / 6`\n\nSo, the volume is:\nVolume = `((6 - √3) / 6)^3 = (6 - √3)³ / 216`\n\nExpanding the numerator:\n(6 - √3)³ = 6³ - 3(6²)(√3) + 3(6)(√3)² - (√3)³\n= 216 - 3(36)(√3) + 18(3) - 3√3\n= 216 - 108√3 + 54 - 3√3\n= 270 - 111√3\n\nTherefore, the exact volume is:\n**(270 - 111√3) / 216**\n\nThis can be simplified by dividing the numerator and denominator by 3:\n**(90 - 37√3) / 72**\n\nAs a decimal approximation:\n√3 ≈ 1.73205\n90 - 37(1.73205) = 90 - 64.08585 = 25.91415\n25.91415 / 72 ≈ 0.35991875\n\nThus, the volume of the intersection of the two cubes is **(90 - 37√3) / 72**.\n\n<<< (90 - 37*sqrt(3))/72 >>>"
