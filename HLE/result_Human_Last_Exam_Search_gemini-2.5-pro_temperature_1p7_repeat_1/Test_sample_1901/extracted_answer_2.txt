The set of design principles described in A, B, C, and F are correct, but the specific molecular structure proposed in D and E, based on a single benzene ring, is unlikely to exhibit the desired room-temperature liquid crystal phases due to insufficient molecular anisotropy. A two-ring core system is generally required.
