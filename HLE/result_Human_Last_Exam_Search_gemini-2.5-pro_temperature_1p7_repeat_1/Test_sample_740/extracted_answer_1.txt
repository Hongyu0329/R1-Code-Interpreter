The values of λ for which the equation has no solutions are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the n x n matrix M, where the entries are given by Mᵢⱼ = 1/(n-i+j) for i, j = 0, 1, ..., n-1. For any specific integer value of n, these values can be calculated. For instance:
- For n=1, λ = 1.
- For n=2, λ = -6 ± 4√3.
