    "To determine the values of λ for which the given integral equation has no solutions, we will analyze the structure of the equation. The equation is a Fredholm integral equation of the second kind:\nu(x) = 1 + λ ∫₀¹ K(x, y) u(y) dy\nwhere the kernel is K(x, y) = (xⁿ - yⁿ) / (x - y). We assume n is a positive integer.\n\nFirst, we can expand the kernel as a finite geometric sum:\nK(x, y) = xⁿ⁻¹ + xⁿ⁻²y + xⁿ⁻³y² + ... + yⁿ⁻¹ = ∑_{k=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1-k} yᵏ.\nThis shows that the kernel is separable.\n\nSubstituting the expanded kernel back into the integral equation:\nu(x) = 1 + λ ∫₀¹ (∑_{k=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1-k} yᵏ) u(y) dy\nu(x) = 1 + λ ∑_{k=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1-k} ∫₀¹ yᵏ u(y) dy\n\nLet's define the moments of u(y) as cₖ = ∫₀¹ yᵏ u(y) dy for k = 0, 1, ..., n-1.\nThe equation for u(x) becomes:\nu(x) = 1 + λ ∑_{k=0}^{n-1} cₖ x^{n-1-k}\nThis expression shows that u(x) must be a polynomial in x of degree at most n-1.\n\nAccording to the Fredholm alternative, the inhomogeneous equation u(x) = f(x) + λ T[u(x)] has no solution if 1/λ is an eigenvalue of the integral operator T, and the forcing function f(x) is not orthogonal to the corresponding eigenfunction(s) of the adjoint operator T*.\nHere, f(x) = 1 and the kernel K(x, y) is symmetric since K(x,y) = ∑_{k=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1-k} yᵏ = ∑_{j=0}^{n-1} xʲ y^{n-1-j} = K(y,x). Thus, the operator T is self-adjoint (T=T*).\n\nThe condition for no solution simplifies to: 1/λ is an eigenvalue of T, and the corresponding eigenfunction u_λ(x) satisfies ∫₀¹ u_λ(x) * 1 dx ≠ 0.\nThe integral ∫₀¹ u_λ(x) dx is simply the zeroth moment, c₀, of the eigenfunction.\n\nLet's find the eigenvalues of the operator T. The eigenvalue equation is u(x) = λ T[u(x)], which is the homogeneous version of our problem:\nu(x) = λ ∑_{k=0}^{n-1} cₖ x^{n-1-k}\nThe eigenfunctions u(x) are polynomials of degree at most n-1. We can represent the operator T as a matrix M in the monomial basis {1, x, x², ..., xⁿ⁻¹}.\nLet's find the action of T on a basis element xʲ:\n(Txʲ)(x) = ∫₀¹ K(x, y) yʲ dy = ∫₀¹ (∑_{k=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1-k} yᵏ) yʲ dy\n(Txʲ)(x) = ∑_{k=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1-k} ∫₀¹ yᵏ⁺ʲ dy = ∑_{k=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1-k} / (k+j+1)\n\nThe matrix M of the operator T in the basis {x⁰, x¹, ..., xⁿ⁻¹} would have entries M_ij corresponding to the coefficient of xⁱ in T(xʲ). However, it's easier to work with the basis {xⁿ⁻¹, xⁿ⁻², ..., x¹} as this simplifies the matrix representation.\nLet's consider the basis {v₀, v₁, ..., vₙ₋₁} where vᵢ(x) = xⁿ⁻¹⁻ⁱ.\nT(vⱼ)(x) = T(xⁿ⁻¹⁻ʲ)(x) = ∑_{k=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1-k} / (k + (n-1-j) + 1) = ∑_{k=0}^{n-1} [1/(k+n-j)] x^{n-1-k}\nSo T(vⱼ) = ∑_{i=0}^{n-1} [1/(i+n-j)] vᵢ.\nThe matrix of T in this basis is M, with entries Mᵢⱼ = 1/(i+n-j).\nThe eigenvalues μ = 1/λ are the eigenvalues of this matrix M.\n\nSo, the equation has no solution if λ = 1/μ, where μ is an eigenvalue of the n x n matrix M with entries Mᵢⱼ = 1/(i+n-j) for i, j ∈ {0, 1, ..., n-1}, provided the corresponding eigenfunction u(x) has a non-zero zeroth moment (c₀ = ∫₀¹ u(y)dy ≠ 0).\n\nLet's test this for small n.\n\n**Case n = 1:**\nThe kernel is K(x,y) = 1. The equation is u(x) = 1 + λ ∫₀¹ u(y)dy.\nu(x) must be a constant, say C. So C = 1 + λC, which gives C(1-λ) = 1.\nIf λ = 1, we get 0 = 1, so there is no solution.\nUsing the matrix method: M is a 1x1 matrix. M₀₀ = 1/(1+0-0) = 1. The eigenvalue is μ=1. So λ = 1/μ = 1. The eigenfunction is a constant, so its integral is non-zero. This matches.\n\n**Case n = 2:**\nThe kernel is K(x,y) = x+y. The matrix M (with i,j from 0,1) is:\nM = [1/(2+0-0)  1/(2+1-0)]\n    [1/(2+0-1)  1/(2+1-1)]\nM = [1/2  1/3]\n    [1    1/2]\nThe characteristic equation is det(M-μI) = 0.\n(1/2 - μ)² - 1*1/3 = 0\n(μ - 1/2)² = 1/3\nμ - 1/2 = ±1/√3\nμ = 1/2 ± 1/√3 = (3 ± 2√3)/6.\nThe values of λ are 1/μ:\nλ = 6 / (3 ± 2√3) = 6(3 ∓ 2√3) / (9 - 12) = -2(3 ∓ 2√3) = -6 ± 4√3.\nFor an eigenvector corresponding to these eigenvalues, the zeroth moment c₀ will be non-zero. If c₀ were zero, it would imply the entire eigenvector is zero, which is not possible. Thus, for n=2, there are no solutions when λ = -6 ± 4√3.\n\nFor a general integer n, the values of λ for which the equation has no solution are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the n x n matrix M defined by Mᵢⱼ = 1/(n+j-i), for i, j ∈ {0, 1, ..., n-1}. Finding a closed-form expression for these eigenvalues for any n is a complex problem. The provided solution represents the condition that these values of λ must satisfy.\n\nThe problem asks for the values of λ, which are precisely this set of numbers determined by the matrix M for a given n.\n\n<<<The values of λ for which the equation has no solutions are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the n x n matrix M, where the entries are given by Mᵢⱼ = 1/(n-i+j) for i, j = 0, 1, ..., n-1. For any specific integer value of n, these values can be calculated. For instance:\n- For n=1, λ = 1.\n- For n=2, λ = -6 ± 4√3.>>>"
