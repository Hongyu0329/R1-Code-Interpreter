    "To determine the largest number of 9 by 1 by 1 blocks that fit inside a cube of edge length 15, we can analyze how the blocks can be arranged within the cube's volume.\n\nFirst, a simple calculation of volume gives an upper limit. The volume of the 15x15x15 cube is 15 * 15 * 15 = 3375 cubic units. The volume of a single 9x1x1 block is 9 cubic units. Dividing the cube's volume by the block's volume gives 3375 / 9 = 375. This is the maximum theoretical number of blocks, but it may not be achievable due to the specific dimensions.\n\nA more effective method is to partition the cube into smaller rectangular boxes. By strategically dividing the 15x15x15 cube, we can create spaces that are more efficiently filled. A logical place to divide the cube is at the 9-unit mark along each axis, as this corresponds to the length of the blocks.\n\nThis partitioning divides the 15x15x15 cube into eight smaller boxes with the following dimensions:\n*   One 9x9x9 cube\n*   Three 9x9x6 boxes\n*   Three 9x6x6 boxes\n*   One 6x6x6 cube\n\nNow, we can calculate how many 9x1x1 blocks fit into each of these smaller boxes:\n*   **In the 9x9x9 box:** By aligning the blocks along one of the axes, we can fit (9/9) * 9 * 9 = 81 blocks.\n*   **In each of the three 9x9x6 boxes:** By aligning the 9-unit length of the blocks with a 9-unit edge of the box, we can fit (9/9) * 9 * 6 = 54 blocks. Since there are three of these boxes, this gives a total of 3 * 54 = 162 blocks.\n*   **In each of the three 9x6x6 boxes:** Similarly, by aligning the blocks with the 9-unit edge, we can fit (9/9) * 6 * 6 = 36 blocks. For three of these boxes, the total is 3 * 36 = 108 blocks.\n*   **In the 6x6x6 box:** No blocks can fit, as the largest dimension of this box (6) is smaller than the length of a block (9).\n\nBy summing the number of blocks from each of these partitions, we get the total number of blocks that can fit inside the 15x15x15 cube:\n81 + 162 + 108 + 0 = 351 blocks.\n\nThis method of partitioning ensures that the space is used efficiently, leaving the unusable volume confined to a single 6x6x6 corner.\n\n<<<351>>>"
