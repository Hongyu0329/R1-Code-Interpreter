1. **Relativity of simultaneity:** No, this would likely be replaced by a concept of absolute simultaneity.
2.  **Relativity of lengths:** Yes, although the interpretation would be different (geometric projection).
3.  **Relativity of time:** Yes, also interpreted as a geometric projection.
4.  **Invariance of the speed of light:** No, this postulate is typically replaced by the postulate of a universal four-dimensional speed for all objects.
5.  **Non-Newtonian addition of speeds:** Yes, the addition of velocities would be non-Newtonian but would also differ from the standard special relativistic formula.
6.  **Formula for relativity of lengths:** $L = L_0 \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}$
7.  **Formula for relativity of time:** $ \Delta t = \frac{\Delta t_0}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}} $
8.  **Formula for non-Newtonian addition of speeds:** The specific formula for velocity addition can differ among the various proposed models of Euclidean relativity. A universally accepted formula within this hypothetical framework is not established.
