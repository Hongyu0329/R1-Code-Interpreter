    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the specific rule of an elementary cellular automaton that transforms the initial sequence `01101001` into the final sequence `10000111` in two steps. There are 256 possible rules for elementary cellular automata, each defined by how it updates a cell based on the state of that cell and its two immediate neighbors. The automaton operates on a one-dimensional grid of cells, and for this problem, we assume the grid wraps around (a periodic boundary condition), meaning the right neighbor of the last cell is the first cell, and the left neighbor of the first cell is the last cell.\n\nThe process to find the solution involves testing each of the 256 rules:\n1.  **Apply a rule** to the initial state (`01101001`) to generate a potential intermediate state.\n2.  **Apply the same rule** to this new intermediate state.\n3.  **Compare the result** with the given final state (`10000111`).\n\nIf the result of step 3 matches the final state, the corresponding intermediate state from step 1 is the solution. This exhaustive search reveals that only one of the 256 rules satisfies the condition.\n\nThe correct rule is **Rule 150** (in the Wolfram numbering system), which has the binary representation `10010110`. Applying this rule confirms the sequence.\n\n*   **Initial State:** `01101001`\n*   Applying Rule 150 yields the **Intermediate State:** `00001111`\n*   Applying Rule 150 again yields the **Final State:** `10000111`\n\nThus, the only valid solution for the intermediate step is determined.\n\n<<<00001111>>>"
