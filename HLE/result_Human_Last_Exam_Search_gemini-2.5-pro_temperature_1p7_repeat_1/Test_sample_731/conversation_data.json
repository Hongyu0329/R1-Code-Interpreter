    "A power subgroup of a group G, denoted as G^q, is the subgroup generated by the q-th powers of all elements in G. To determine the number of distinct power subgroups of the semidihedral group of size 512, SD_512, we must first understand its structure and the properties of its elements' orders.\n\nThe semidihedral group SD_{2^n} is defined by the presentation:\n<center>SD_{2^n} = &lt; r, s | r<sup>2<sup>n-1</sup></sup> = s<sup>2</sup> = 1, srs = r<sup>2<sup>n-2</sup>-1</sup> &gt;</center>\nFor SD_512, we have n=9, so its presentation is:\n<center>SD_512 = &lt; r, s | r<sup>256</sup> = s<sup>2</sup> = 1, srs = r<sup>127</sup> &gt;</center>\nThe elements of SD_512 are of the form r<sup>i</sup>s<sup>j</sup> where 0 ≤ i < 256 and j ∈ {0, 1}.\n\nA key property is that for any finite group G, the power subgroup G^q is identical to G^d, where d is the greatest common divisor of q and the exponent of G. The exponent of a group is the least common multiple of the orders of all its elements.\n\nThe orders of the elements in SD_512 are powers of 2. The order of the element *r* is 256. The order of elements of the form *r<sup>i</sup>s* can be shown to be either 2 or 4. Consequently, the exponent of SD_512 is the least common multiple of all possible orders, which is lcm(256, 4) = 256.\n\nTherefore, the distinct power subgroups correspond to the divisors of the exponent, 256. The divisors of 256 (which is 2<sup>8</sup>) are 2<sup>0</sup>, 2<sup>1</sup>, 2<sup>2</sup>, 2<sup>3</sup>, 2<sup>4</sup>, 2<sup>5</sup>, 2<sup>6</sup>, 2<sup>7</sup>, and 2<sup>8</sup>. This gives us a total of 9 possible distinct power subgroups.\n\nThese subgroups are:\n<ul>\n  <li><b>G<sup>1</sup></b>: The entire group SD_512.</li>\n  <li><b>G<sup>2</sup></b>: The subgroup generated by the squares of all elements. This can be shown to be the cyclic subgroup &lt;r<sup>2</sup>&gt;, which has an order of 128.</li>\n  <li><b>G<sup>4</sup></b>: The subgroup &lt;r<sup>4</sup>&gt;, which is a cyclic group of order 64.</li>\n  <li><b>G<sup>8</sup></b>: The subgroup &lt;r<sup>8</sup>&gt;, a cyclic group of order 32.</li>\n  <li><b>G<sup>16</sup></b>: The subgroup &lt;r<sup>16</sup>&gt;, a cyclic group of order 16.</li>\n  <li><b>G<sup>32</sup></b>: The subgroup &lt;r<sup>32</sup>&gt;, a cyclic group of order 8.</li>\n  <li><b>G<sup>64</sup></b>: The subgroup &lt;r<sup>64</sup>&gt;, a cyclic group of order 4.</li>\n  <li><b>G<sup>128</sup></b>: The subgroup &lt;r<sup>128</sup>&gt;, a cyclic group of order 2. This is the center of the group, Z(SD_512).</li>\n  <li><b>G<sup>256</sup></b>: The trivial subgroup containing only the identity element, {e}.</li>\n</ul>\nEach of these subgroups is distinct. SD_512 is non-abelian, while the other eight are cyclic and thus abelian. The cyclic subgroups are all of different orders, so they are distinct from one another. This confirms that there are exactly 9 power subgroups.\n\n<<<9>>>"
