A detailed management plan for a 45-year-old obese woman with uncontrolled diabetes mellitus (HbA1c 7.5%) who suffered avulsion of her maxillary left lateral incisor, canine, and first premolar with a 28-hour delay in seeking treatment, and who also presents with a skeletal Class III tendency (SNB angle of 88°), would involve the following:

**I. Immediate Management (Emergency Phase):**

*   **Systemic Health Management:** Given her uncontrolled diabetes, the immediate priority is a medical consultation to initiate or adjust medication to lower her HbA1c levels. This is crucial as hyperglycemia impairs wound healing and increases the risk of post-traumatic infection. Prophylactic broad-spectrum antibiotics are strongly recommended.
*   **Dental Management:** Due to the 28-hour delay, the periodontal ligament cells are non-viable. The prognosis for normal healing is extremely poor.
    1.  The avulsed teeth will be cleaned of debris.
    2.  The necrotic periodontal ligament will be mechanically removed from the root surfaces.
    3.  Extraoral root canal treatment will be performed on all three avulsed teeth. This is to prevent infection and subsequent inflammatory root resorption.
    4.  The alveolar sockets will be gently irrigated.
    5.  The teeth will be replanted and splinted using a non-rigid splint to adjacent teeth for approximately 2-4 weeks.
    *The patient must be counseled that this is a temporary measure. The teeth are expected to undergo ankylosis (fusion with the bone) and replacement resorption over the next few years, essentially acting as a natural space maintainer.*

**II. Significance of Clinical Findings:**

*   **SNB angle of 88⁰:** This indicates a prognathic mandible, leading to a skeletal Class III malocclusion. This is critical for future prosthetic design, as it will affect the biting forces and the arrangement of the artificial teeth to ensure a stable and functional occlusion.
*   **Uncontrolled Diabetes (HbA1c 7.5%) & Obesity:** These conditions compromise the patient's immune response and healing capacity. This increases the risk of infection after replantation and negatively impacts the long-term success of any future surgical options like dental implants. Strict glycemic control is paramount before any elective prosthetic work.

**III. Cells of Interest:**

The primary cells involved in the healing process following this delayed replantation are:
*   **Osteoclasts:** Responsible for resorbing the root of the replanted tooth.
*   **Osteoblasts:** Bone-forming cells that will replace the resorbed root structure with bone, leading to ankylosis.
*   **Periodontal Ligament (PDL) Cells & Cementoblasts:** These cells are notable for their absence on the root surface due to the prolonged extra-oral time. Their loss is the primary reason why normal periodontal healing is not possible.
*   **Immune Cells (Neutrophils, Macrophages):** These will be active in the initial inflammatory response. Their function may be suppressed due to the patient's diabetic state.

**IV. Definitive Prosthetic Management: Denture Replacement**

Once the replanted teeth fail or are electively removed, a definitive prosthetic solution will be necessary. Given the patient's systemic condition and the likely need for a reliable, hygienic, and non-invasive long-term solution, a **Cast Metal Framework Removable Partial Denture** is recommended. Dental implants would be a high-risk option until her diabetes is well-controlled for a sustained period.

*   **Denture Type and Material:**
    *   **Type:** Cast metal framework removable partial denture.
    *   **Material:** The framework should be made of a Cobalt-Chromium alloy for its rigidity, strength, and biocompatibility. The artificial teeth would be made from acrylic resin for aesthetics, and the base would be a combination of the metal framework and pink acrylic to mimic the gums.

*   **Abutment Teeth and Rationale:**
    *   **Primary Abutments:**
        *   **Maxillary Left Second Premolar:** As the tooth immediately posterior to
