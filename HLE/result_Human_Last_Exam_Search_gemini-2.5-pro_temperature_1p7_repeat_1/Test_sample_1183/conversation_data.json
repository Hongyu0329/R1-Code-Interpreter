    "The molecule represented by the SMILES string `C#Cc1cc2ccc3c(C#C)cc4ccc5c(C#C)cc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67` is known as γ-graphyne (gamma-graphyne). This molecule is a two-dimensional allotrope of carbon, characterized by a planar sheet of sp- and sp²-bonded carbon atoms arranged in a hexagonal crystal lattice. The structure consists of benzene rings connected by acetylene linkers.\n\nγ-Graphyne is noted for being the most symmetric allotrope in the graphyne family. Theoretical studies and experimental characterizations have confirmed its hexagonal symmetry. The point group of a molecule describes its symmetry in terms of symmetry elements and operations. For a planar molecule with a six-fold rotational axis and a horizontal mirror plane, the corresponding point group is D6h.\n\nThe key symmetry elements of γ-graphyne that lead to its classification in the D6h point group include:\n*   A principal C6 axis of rotation, perpendicular to the plane of the molecule.\n*   Six C2 axes of rotation lying within the molecular plane.\n*   A horizontal mirror plane (σh) which is the plane of the molecule itself.\n*   Six vertical mirror planes (three σv and three σd).\n*   An inversion center (i).\n\nStudies on the properties of graphyne materials confirm that the hexagonal graphyne structures, including γ-graphyne, belong to the D6h point group, similar to graphene.\n\n<<<D6h>>>"
