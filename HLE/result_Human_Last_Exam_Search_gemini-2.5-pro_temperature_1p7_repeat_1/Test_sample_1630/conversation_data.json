    "Let $h(x) = f(g(x))$. We are looking for the maximum number of real solutions to the equation $h(x) = x$, which represents the fixed points of the function $h(x)$.\n\nFirst, let's determine the nature of the composite function $h(x)$.\n1.  **Degree of the Polynomial**: Since $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are both polynomials of degree 3, their composition, $h(x) = f(g(x))$, will be a polynomial of degree $3 \\times 3 = 9$. For example, if $f(x) = ax^3 + \\dots$ and $g(x) = bx^3 + \\dots$ (with $a, b \\neq 0$), the leading term of $f(g(x))$ is $a(bx^3)^3 = ab^3x^9$. The degree of a polynomial is the highest degree of its terms.\n\n2.  **The Fixed-Point Equation**: The fixed points are the solutions to $f(g(x)) = x$. This can be rewritten as $f(g(x)) - x = 0$. Since $f(g(x))$ is a polynomial of degree 9, the equation $f(g(x)) - x = 0$ is a polynomial equation of degree 9.\n\n3.  **Maximum Number of Roots**: According to the fundamental theorem of algebra, a polynomial of degree $n$ can have at most $n$ real roots. Therefore, a polynomial equation of degree 9 can have at most 9 real solutions. This means that $f(g(x))$ can have a maximum of 9 fixed points.\n\nNow, let's consider the given constraints:\n1.  **$g'(x) > 0$ for all $x$**: This means that $g(x)$ is a strictly increasing function.\n2.  **$f'(x) > 0$ for all $x$**: This means that $f(x)$ is a strictly increasing function.\n\nLet's analyze the derivative of the composite function $h(x) = f(g(x))$ using the chain rule:\n$h'(x) = f'(g(x)) \\cdot g'(x)$\n\nSince $g'(x)$ is always positive and $f'(y)$ is always positive for any input $y$, $f'(g(x))$ must also be positive. The product of two positive numbers is positive, so $h'(x) > 0$ for all $x$. This shows that the resulting degree-9 polynomial, $h(x)$, is also a strictly increasing function.\n\nThe final question is whether a strictly increasing polynomial of degree 9 can have 9 fixed points. A fixed point is an intersection between the curve $y = h(x)$ and the line $y=x$.\nFor $h(x)$ to have 9 fixed points, the polynomial $P(x) = h(x) - x$ must have 9 real roots. The derivative of this polynomial is $P'(x) = h'(x) - 1$.\nSince $h'(x) > 0$, the sign of $P'(x)$ is not fixed; it can be positive, negative, or zero. This allows the function $P(x)$ to have local maxima and minima. A polynomial of degree 9 can have up to 8 local extrema (where $P'(x)=0$), which allows it to cross the x-axis up to 9 times.\n\nIt is possible to construct a strictly increasing polynomial of degree 9 that intersects the line $y=x$ at 9 distinct points. While the specific construction of polynomials $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ that satisfy the conditions and result in 9 fixed points is complex, no theorem forbids this possibility. The degree of the composite polynomial is the limiting factor.\n\nThus, the maximum number of fixed points for $f(g(x))$ is 9.\n\n<<<9>>>"
