    "The minimum number of bipartite graphs required to cover all the edges of the complete graph \\( K_n \\) is a well-known result in graph theory, referred to as the biclique cover number or bipartite dimension of \\( K_n \\). This number is denoted as \\( bc(K_n) \\).\n\nThe formula for the biclique cover number of a complete graph \\( K_n \\) is \\( \\lceil \\log_2 n \\rceil \\). This represents the smallest integer greater than or equal to the base-2 logarithm of n.\n\nFor the specific case of \\( n = 35 \\), the problem is to calculate \\( \\lceil \\log_2 35 \\rceil \\).\n\nTo find the value of \\( \\log_2 35 \\), we can consider the powers of 2:\n*   \\( 2^5 = 32 \\)\n*   \\( 2^6 = 64 \\)\n\nSince 35 is between 32 and 64, the value of \\( \\log_2 35 \\) will be between 5 and 6. Therefore, the smallest integer greater than or equal to \\( \\log_2 35 \\) is 6.\n\nThus, the minimum number of bipartite graphs needed to cover all the edges of \\( K_{35} \\) is 6.\n\n<<<6>>>"
