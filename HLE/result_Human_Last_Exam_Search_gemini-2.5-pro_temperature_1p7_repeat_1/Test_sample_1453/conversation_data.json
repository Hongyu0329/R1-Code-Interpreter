    "To determine the oligomeric state of the provided coiled-coil sequence, we must analyze its heptad repeat pattern, specifically the amino acids at the core 'a' and 'd' positions. The interactions between the side chains of these residues, known as \"knobs-into-holes\" packing, are the primary determinant of the number of helices in the coiled-coil bundle.\n\nFirst, we need to identify the heptad repeat, which is a repeating pattern of seven amino acids labeled (abcdefg)n. The 'a' and 'd' positions are typically occupied by hydrophobic residues that form the core of the structure. We can find the correct register by looking for a consistent pattern of hydrophobic residues at positions `i` and `i+3`.\n\nThe sequence is: `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG`\n\nLet's analyze potential registers:\n\n1.  **Register 1**: Let's assume the Alanine (A) at position 4 is at the 'a' position and the Leucine (L) at position 7 is at the 'd' position.\n    *   This establishes a repeating pattern where the 'a' positions are A(4), A(11), A(18), A(25), and the 'd' positions are L(7), L(14), L(21), L(28).\n    *   This gives a consistent core pattern of `a=A, d=L`. Alanine is a very small hydrophobic residue. This combination of a small residue at 'a' and a larger one at 'd' allows for close, efficient packing, which is characteristic of a **dimer** (a two-helix bundle).\n    *   However, in this register, the 'g' position (the residue just before 'a') is consistently occupied by Isoleucine (I). The 'g' position is typically solvent-exposed and polar. Placing a bulky hydrophobic residue like Isoleucine at the 'g' position is highly unfavorable for a dimer and suggests a higher-order structure where this residue can be more buried. This creates a conflicting signal.\n\n2.  **Register 2**: Let's assume the Leucine (L) at position 7 is at the 'a' position and the Isoleucine (I) at position 10 is at the 'd' position.\n    *   This establishes a repeating pattern where the 'a' positions are L(7), L(14), L(21), L(28), and the 'd' positions are I(10), I(17), I(24), K(31).\n    *   This gives a consistent core pattern of `a=L, d=I` for three full repeats. The final repeat is broken by a polar Lysine (K) at a 'd' position, which likely acts as a capping residue to terminate the coiled-coil structure.\n    *   The `a=L, d=I` arrangement is a classic and well-studied determinant for forming **tetramers** (four-helix bundles). Seminal work by Harbury et al. on the GCN4 coiled-coil demonstrated that placing Leucine at 'a' and Isoleucine at 'd' specifically directs the formation of a tetramer due to the specific requirements of knobs-into-holes packing.\n    *   Furthermore, in this register, the 'e' positions are consistently occupied by Alanine (A). While 'e' positions are often charged, having a hydrophobic residue here can also drive the formation of higher-order oligomers to shield these nonpolar residues from the aqueous solvent.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nWhile Register 1 has a very consistent core pattern, its non-canonical 'g' positions create ambiguity. Register 2, however, contains the canonical `a=L, d=I` sequence motif that is known to be a strong determinant for tetramerization. The other features in this register, such as the `e=A` residues, are also consistent with a higher-order oligomeric state. The break in the pattern at the very end of the sequence does not negate the strong signal from the preceding three repeats. Therefore, based on the principles of knobs-into-holes packing and experimentally determined rules, the sequence is most likely to form a tetramer.\n\nThe oligomeric state would be 4.\n\n<<<C>>>"
