    "A total of **two** elements of the homology cobordism group can be represented by an integral surgery on a knot with at most four crossings.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the reasoning:\n\n1.  **Relevant Knots and Surgeries**: The knots with four or fewer crossings are the unknot (0₁), the trefoil knot (3₁), and the figure-eight knot (4₁). For an integral surgery on a knot to produce a homology sphere (an element of the homology cobordism group), the surgery coefficient must be +1 or -1.\n\n2.  **The Unknot (0₁)**: Surgery on the unknot with a coefficient of +1 or -1 results in the 3-sphere (S³). The 3-sphere is the identity element in the homology cobordism group. Therefore, the unknot represents the **trivial element**.\n\n3.  **The Figure-Eight Knot (4₁)**: The figure-eight knot is a slice knot. A fundamental result in topology states that a ±1 surgery on a knot yields a manifold that is homology cobordant to the 3-sphere if and only if the knot is slice. Since the figure-eight knot is slice, both +1 and -1 surgeries on it represent the **trivial element** in the homology cobordism group.\n\n4.  **The Trefoil Knot (3₁)**: The trefoil knot is not slice; a key reason is that its signature is non-zero.\n    *   **+1 surgery** on the right-handed trefoil produces the Poincaré homology sphere. Because the trefoil is not slice, the Poincaré sphere represents a **non-trivial element** in the homology cobordism group.\n    *   **-1 surgery** on the right-handed trefoil is equivalent to +1 surgery on its mirror image (the left-handed trefoil). The resulting manifold is the mirror image of the Poincaré sphere. In the homology cobordism group, the class of a mirror manifold is the inverse of the original. However, the Poincaré sphere is known to have an order of 2 in the homology cobordism group, meaning it is its own inverse.\n    *   Therefore, both +1 and -1 surgeries on the trefoil knot (and its mirror image) represent the *same* single non-trivial element.\n\nIn summary, the distinct elements found are:\n*   The **trivial element**, which is represented by surgeries on both the unknot and the figure-eight knot.\n*   A single **non-trivial element** of order two (the class of the Poincaré sphere), represented by surgeries on the trefoil knot.\n\nThese two cases account for all integral surgeries on all knots with at most four crossings, resulting in two distinct elements.\n\n<<<2>>>"
