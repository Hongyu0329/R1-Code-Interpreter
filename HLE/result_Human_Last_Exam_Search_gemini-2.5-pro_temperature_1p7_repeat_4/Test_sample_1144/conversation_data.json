    "To find the ratio of the uncertainty of the momentum of an electron to its momentum in the first Bohr orbit, we will perform the following calculations:\n\n**1. Determine the uncertainty in momentum (Δp):**\n\nAccording to Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle, the relationship between the uncertainty in position (Δx) and the uncertainty in momentum (Δp) is given by:\nΔx * Δp ≥ ħ / 2\nwhere ħ is the reduced Planck constant (approximately 1.05457 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s).\n\nGiven the uncertainty in position Δx = 10 pm = 10 x 10⁻¹² m.\n\nWe can calculate the minimum uncertainty in momentum as:\nΔp = ħ / (2 * Δx)\nΔp = (1.05457 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s) / (2 * 10 x 10⁻¹² m)\nΔp ≈ 5.273 x 10⁻²⁴ kg·m/s\n\n**2. Determine the momentum of the electron in the first Bohr orbit (p):**\n\nThe angular momentum (L) of an electron in the nth Bohr orbit is quantized and given by the formula L = nħ, where n is the principal quantum number. For the first Bohr orbit, n=1, so L = ħ.\n\nThe angular momentum is also defined as L = p * r, where p is the linear momentum and r is the radius of the orbit. For the first Bohr orbit, the radius is the Bohr radius (a₀), which is approximately 5.29177 x 10⁻¹¹ m.\n\nTherefore, the momentum (p) of the electron is:\np = L / r = ħ / a₀\np = (1.05457 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s) / (5.29177 x 10⁻¹¹ m)\np ≈ 1.993 x 10⁻²⁴ kg·m/s\n\n**3. Calculate the ratio of the uncertainty in momentum to the momentum:**\n\nRatio = Δp / p\nRatio = (ħ / (2 * Δx)) / (ħ / a₀)\nRatio = a₀ / (2 * Δx)\nRatio = (5.29177 x 10⁻¹¹ m) / (2 * 10 x 10⁻¹² m)\nRatio ≈ 2.646\n\n<<<2.646>>>"
