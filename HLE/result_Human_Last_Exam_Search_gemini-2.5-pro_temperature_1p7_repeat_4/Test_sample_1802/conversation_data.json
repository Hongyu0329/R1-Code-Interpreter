    "A Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ that transforms a qudit density matrix (a $d \\times d$ matrix) is defined by the action of generalized Pauli operators. To determine the maximal rank of its complementary channel, we need to understand the relationship between a channel, its Kraus operators, and its complementary channel.\n\n**1. Pauli Channel and its Kraus Operators:**\nA generalized Pauli channel for a $d$-dimensional quantum system (a qudit) is given by the following expression:\n$\\Lambda(\\rho) = \\sum_{k,l=0}^{d-1} p_{kl} U_{kl} \\rho U_{kl}^\\dagger$\n\nHere:\n*   $\\rho$ is the $d \\times d$ density matrix of the qudit.\n*   $U_{kl}$ are the generalized Pauli operators (or Weyl-Heisenberg operators), which form a complete orthonormal basis for the space of $d \\times d$ matrices. There are $d^2$ such operators.\n*   $p_{kl}$ are non-negative coefficients that form a probability distribution, i.e., $\\sum_{k,l=0}^{d-1} p_{kl} = 1$.\n\nThe Kraus operators for this channel are $A_{kl} = \\sqrt{p_{kl}} U_{kl}$. The action of the channel can be written as $\\Lambda(\\rho) = \\sum_{k,l} A_{kl} \\rho A_{kl}^\\dagger$.\n\n**2. Complementary Channel and its Rank:**\nAny quantum channel $\\Lambda$ can be represented using a Stinespring dilation, which involves a unitary operation on a larger system that includes an \"environment\". The complementary channel, denoted as $\\Lambda^c$, describes the information that leaks into this environment.\n\nThe rank of the complementary channel is equal to the number of linearly independent Kraus operators in a minimal representation of the original channel $\\Lambda$.\n\n**3. Determining the Maximal Rank:**\nTo find the maximal rank of the complementary channel of a Pauli channel, we need to find the maximum possible number of linearly independent Kraus operators for $\\Lambda$.\n\nThe Kraus operators are $A_{kl} = \\sqrt{p_{kl}} U_{kl}$. The linear independence of this set of operators depends on two factors:\n1.  The linear independence of the generalized Pauli operators $U_{kl}$.\n2.  The number of non-zero coefficients $p_{kl}$.\n\nThe set of $d^2$ generalized Pauli operators $\\{U_{kl}\\}$ is known to be a complete basis for the vector space of $d \\times d$ complex matrices. Therefore, all $d^2$ operators are linearly independent.\n\nTo maximize the number of linearly independent Kraus operators, we can choose a Pauli channel where all the probabilities $p_{kl}$ are non-zero. A simple example is the completely depolarizing channel, where $p_{kl} = 1/d^2$ for all $k,l \\in \\{0, 1, ..., d-1\\}$.\n\nIn this case, we have $d^2$ Kraus operators, all of which are non-zero multiples of the linearly independent Pauli operators $U_{kl}$. Consequently, these $d^2$ Kraus operators are themselves linearly independent.\n\nSince the rank of the complementary channel equals the number of linearly independent Kraus operators of the original channel, the maximal rank is $d^2$.\n\n<<<The maximal rank of the complementary channel of a Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ acting on a $d$-dimensional qudit is $d^2$.>>>"
