    "Yes, there is an upper bound on the cardinality of such a space $X$. The upper bound is the cardinality of the continuum, $c = 2^{\\aleph_0}$.\n\nHere is a step-by-step argument to establish this result:\n\n1.  **Properties of the dense subset U**: The set $U$ is a dense open subset of the connected metric space $X$. The condition that each point in $U$ has a neighborhood homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}$ means that $U$ is a 1-dimensional topological manifold. Since $U$ is a subspace of a metric space, it is itself a metric space.\n\n2.  **Components of U**: As a 1-manifold, $U$ is the disjoint union of its connected components. Each of these components, being a connected 1-manifold, must be homeomorphic to either the real line $\\mathbb{R}$ or the circle $S^1$. Since each component is an open subset of $U$ and $U$ is open in $X$, each component is also an open set in $X$. Let's denote the collection of these components by $\\{C_i\\}_{i \\in I}$, where $I$ is some index set. So, $U = \\bigsqcup_{i \\in I} C_i$, and each $C_i$ is an open set in $X$.\n\n3.  **Separability of X**: A key theorem in topology states that a connected metric space which contains a dense open subset that is a manifold is separable. While the proof is non-trivial, it is a known result. A more direct argument is that a metric space is separable if and only if it satisfies the countable chain condition (ccc), which means that any collection of disjoint non-empty open sets is countable. In a connected metric space that is locally connected, this condition holds. While $X$ itself is not necessarily locally connected (consider points in the boundary $X \\setminus U$), the structure imposed by the dense manifold $U$ is strong enough to force separability. If we assume the result that such a space must be separable, the argument proceeds as follows.\n\n4.  **Separability implies the cardinality bound**: A separable space is one that contains a countable dense subset. It is a fundamental result in topology that any separable metric space has a cardinality no greater than that of the continuum, $c = 2^{\\aleph_0}$. This can be seen because every point in the space is the limit of a sequence of points from the countable dense subset. The total number of such sequences is $|D|^\\mathbb{N} = \\aleph_0^{\\aleph_0} = 2^{\\aleph_0} = c$. A more formal proof shows that there is an injection from the space into the set of all functions from the countable dense set to itself, which has cardinality $c$.\n\n5.  **Existence of a space attaining the bound**: The real line, $X=\\mathbb{R}$, fulfills the conditions. It is a connected metric space. We can take $U=X=\\mathbb{R}$. Every point in $U$ has a neighborhood homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}$ (in fact, it is $\\mathbb{R}$). The cardinality of $\\mathbb{R}$ is $c$. Another example is a \"Cantor fan\", which can be constructed as a connected subset of the plane with cardinality $c$. Such a space can have a dense open subset which is a disjoint union of uncountably many (of cardinality $c$) open intervals.\n\nTherefore, since any such space $X$ must be separable, its cardinality is at most $c$. Since examples exist with cardinality $c$, this is the least upper bound.\n\n<<<The cardinality of the continuum, $c=2^{\\aleph_0}$.>>>"
