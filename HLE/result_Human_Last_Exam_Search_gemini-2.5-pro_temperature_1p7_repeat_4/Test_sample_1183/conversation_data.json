    "The molecule represented by the SMILES string `C#Cc1cc2ccc3c(C#C)cc4ccc5c(C#C)cc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67` is a type of ethynyl-functionalized triangular graphene quantum dot.\n\nBased on its structure, the molecule possesses the following symmetry elements:\n*   A threefold principal axis of rotation (C₃).\n*   Three twofold axes of rotation (C₂) perpendicular to the principal axis.\n*   A horizontal mirror plane (σh) that contains the entire molecule, as it is planar.\n*   Three vertical mirror planes (σᵥ) that each pass through a corner of the molecule and the midpoint of the opposite side.\n*   A threefold improper rotation axis (S₃).\n\nA molecule with this combination of symmetry elements belongs to the **D₃h** point group. This point group is characterized by a high degree of symmetry, including a principal C₃ axis, three perpendicular C₂ axes, and a horizontal mirror plane. Triangular and hexagonal graphene quantum dots are known to often exhibit this D₃h symmetry.\n\n<<<D₃h>>>"
