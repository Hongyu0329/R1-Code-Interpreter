    "The question asks for the maximum number of colors required for a proper vertex coloring of a graph G with 12345 vertices, given that G is not a complete graph. This number is known as the chromatic number, denoted by $\\chi(G)$.\n\nHere is a step-by-step determination of this value:\n\n1.  **Upper Bound for Chromatic Number**: For any graph with $n$ vertices, the chromatic number $\\chi(G)$ is at most $n$. This is because, in the worst case, we can assign a unique color to each vertex.\n\n2.  **The Case of a Complete Graph**: A graph requires $n$ colors if and only if it is the complete graph $K_n$, where every vertex is connected to every other vertex. In a complete graph, all vertices are adjacent, so they must all receive different colors.\n\n3.  **Exclusion of the Complete Graph**: The problem explicitly states that the graph $G$ is *other than the complete graph*. This means $G \\neq K_{12345}$. Therefore, the chromatic number of $G$ must be strictly less than 12345. This sets an upper bound for the required number of colors:\n    $\\chi(G) \\leq 12345 - 1 = 12344$.\n\n4.  **Achievability of the Upper Bound**: To determine if 12344 is the maximum possible number of colors, we need to see if there exists a graph $G$ with 12345 vertices that is not complete and has a chromatic number of 12344. Consider the following graph:\n    *   Let $G$ be the graph formed by the disjoint union of a complete graph on 12344 vertices ($K_{12344}$) and a single isolated vertex ($K_1$).\n    *   This graph has $12344 + 1 = 12345$ vertices.\n    *   This graph is not a complete graph because the isolated vertex is not connected to any other vertices.\n    *   The chromatic number of this graph is the maximum of the chromatic numbers of its components. The chromatic number of $K_{12344}$ is 12344, and the chromatic number of $K_1$ is 1. Thus, $\\chi(G) = \\max(12344, 1) = 12344$.\n\nSince we have shown that the number of colors cannot exceed 12344, and we have constructed a graph that requires 12344 colors, the maximum number of colors needed is 12344.\n\nThe mention of the maximum degree $\\Delta(G)$ relates to Brooks' Theorem, which states that for a connected graph $G$ that is not a complete graph or an odd cycle, $\\chi(G) \\le \\Delta(G)$. For the example graph $K_{12344} \\cup K_1$, the maximum degree is $\\Delta(G) = 12343$. The chromatic number is $12344 = \\Delta(G)+1$. This does not violate Brooks' Theorem, as the theorem's exceptions include graphs whose components are complete graphs.\n\n<<<12344>>>"
