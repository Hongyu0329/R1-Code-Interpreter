    "For a flow cytometry sorting experiment using Streptavidin beads with five detection channels (AF350, GFP, PE, AF647, and AF750), you should prepare a minimum of **12 essential control samples** in addition to your fully stained experimental sample. These controls are crucial for accurate instrument setup, compensation, and gating to ensure the purity and viability of your sorted cells.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the essential controls and their purposes:\n\n### 1.  Instrument and Staining Quality Controls (2 tubes)\n*   **Unstained Cells (1 control):** This is the most basic control. It consists of cells that have not been treated with any fluorescent dye or antibody. Its purposes are to:\n    *   Assess the baseline autofluorescence of your cell population.\n    *   Set the initial forward and side scatter voltages and gates to identify your cell population of interest and exclude debris.\n\n*   **Viability Dye Control (Included in all samples, but requires a dedicated compensation control):** Dead cells can non-specifically bind antibodies and have higher autofluorescence, leading to false positives. A viability dye is essential to exclude these cells from your analysis and sort.\n    *   This dye should be included in all stained samples (except the unstained control).\n    *   One of your channels, for instance AF350, would be dedicated to this viability dye.\n\n*   **Streptavidin-only Control (1 control):** This sample contains cells incubated with the cocktail of streptavidin-fluorophore conjugates (PE, AF647, and AF750) but without any biotinylated primary antibodies. This is critical to test for non-specific binding of the streptavidin reagents themselves to your cells.\n\n### 2.  Compensation Controls (5 tubes)\nCompensation is a mathematical correction for the spectral overlap of fluorophores into detectors they are not intended for. This is absolutely essential for any multicolor flow cytometry experiment. You need a single-stained control for each fluorophore in your panel. These can be prepared using either cells or compensation beads, with beads often providing a clearer positive signal.\n\n*   **AF350 single stain (1 control):** Typically your viability dye.\n*   **GFP single control (1 control):** This will be a sample of cells that are positive for GFP but are not stained with any other color. You will also need a GFP-negative population to set compensation correctly.\n*   **PE single stain (1 control):** Cells (or beads) stained with a biotinylated antibody and Streptavidin-PE.\n*   **AF647 single stain (1 control):** Cells (or beads) stained with a biotinylated antibody and Streptavidin-AF647.\n*   **AF750 single stain (1 control):** Cells (or beads) stained with a biotinylated antibody and Streptavidin-AF750.\n\n### 3.  Gating Controls (5 tubes)\n*   **Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls (5 controls):** FMO controls are critical for setting accurate gates, especially for dim markers or when populations are not clearly separated. An FMO control includes all the fluorescent labels in your panel *except* for the one being evaluated. This reveals the \"spread\" or background fluorescence from all other fluorochromes into that specific channel, providing the most accurate negative control for gating. For a five-color experiment, you should prepare five FMO controls:\n    *   **FMO AF350:** Cells stained with GFP, PE, AF647, and AF750 (i.e., everything except the viability dye in the AF350 channel).\n    *   **FMO GFP:** Cells stained with the viability dye and all streptavidin conjugates (PE, AF647, AF750), used on a GFP-negative cell sample.\n    *   **FMO PE:** Cells stained with the viability dye and the AF647 and AF750 streptavidin conjugates, but without the PE conjugate.\n    *   **FMO AF647:** Cells stained with the viability dye and the PE and AF750 streptavidin conjugates, but without the AF647 conjugate.\n    *   **FMO AF750:** Cells stained with the viability dye and the PE and AF647 streptavidin conjugates, but without the AF750 conjugate.\n\n### Summary of Control Tubes:\n\n| Control Type | Purpose | Number of Tubes |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| Unstained | Set baseline fluorescence and scatter | 1 |\n| Compensation | Correct for spectral overlap | 5 |\n| FMO (Gating) | Set accurate sort gates | 5 |\n| Streptavidin-Only | Check for non-specific secondary binding | 1 |\n| **Total Essential Controls** | | **12** |\n\nWhile the use of isotype controls is common, their utility for setting gates is highly debated, and FMO controls are now widely considered the more appropriate and accurate control for this purpose. Therefore, they are not included in the list of *essential* controls for a modern, rigorous flow cytometry experiment.\n\n<<<12>>>"
