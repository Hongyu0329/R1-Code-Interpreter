    "A hypothetical perfluoronanocar would contain 22 fluorine atoms.\n\nThis conclusion is based on the structure of the original nanocar developed at Rice University in 2005. This molecular vehicle consists of two main parts: a central chassis and four wheels.\n\nThe wheels are buckminsterfullerenes (C₆₀), which are spherical molecules made entirely of carbon atoms. As they contain no hydrogen, they would not be subject to fluorination.\n\nThe chassis is based on a class of molecules known as oligo(phenylene ethynylene)s. To determine the number of fluorine atoms in a perfluorinated version, one must count the number of hydrogen atoms on this core structure. The fundamental chassis of the original nanocar has 22 hydrogen atoms attached to its aromatic framework.\n\nIn a \"perfluoro\" nanocar, every hydrogen atom on the chassis would be replaced by a fluorine atom. Therefore, the total number of fluorine atoms would be 22.\n\n<<<22>>>"
