    "The search results consistently indicate that a common and efficient method for producing Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF4) is by heating a mixture of xenon and fluorine gas. Several sources specify the temperature for this reaction.\n\n*   The original synthesis in 1962 was carried out by heating a 1:5 molar ratio of xenon and fluorine to 400°C in a nickel container.\n*   Multiple sources confirm that heating a mixture of xenon and fluorine to 400°C is a standard method for XeF4 synthesis.\n*   One patent describes a temperature range of 350°C to 450°C, with 400°C being the preferred temperature.\n*   Flow methods using a nickel tube are also mentioned, with a temperature range of 300-500°C.\n*   Another source states that at 120°C, it is possible to synthesize XeF6 in the presence of a nickel difluoride catalyst. However, the question specifically asks about the efficient production of Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF4).\n*   There is a method involving the reaction of XeF4 with O2F2 between 140 and 195 K (which is -133.15 °C to -78.15 °C) to produce XeF6, not XeF4.\n*   Another method describes the synthesis of XeF2 by trapping the product at -78°C, while the reaction itself is carried out either thermally at 400-500°C or photochemically.\n\nBased on the provided information, the most consistently cited and lowest temperature for the *efficient* direct synthesis of XeF4 from xenon and fluorine is 400°C. While other temperatures are mentioned for different xenon fluorides or under different conditions (like photochemical methods which don't specify an equivalent \"coldest\" temperature in the same sense as thermal methods), 400°C is the established temperature for efficient production of XeF4.\n\nTherefore, comparing this with the answer choices:\nA. 600 C\nB. 400 C\nC. 200 C\nD. 78 C\nE. 0 C\nF. -78 C\n\nThe correct answer is 400 C.\n\n<<<B>>>"
