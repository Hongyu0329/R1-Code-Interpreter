    "In a 2008 performance of the *Don Quixote* ballet, Natalia Osipova, dancing as Kitri for the Bolshoi Ballet, was noted for her exceptional technical skill and vibrant stage presence. While descriptions of her performance in the Act I variation highlight her \"fast footwork\" and \"fast turns,\" a precise count of the single-turn pirouettes en dehors from the fifth position is not available in written accounts.\n\nTo determine the exact number, a direct analysis of a video recording of the performance would be required. Although several video clips of her 2008 performance exist online, they are not accessible for analysis by this service. Therefore, a definitive number of pirouettes cannot be provided.\n\n<<<I am unable to answer the question as the specific count of pirouettes is not documented in the available text-based sources and requires visual analysis of the performance.>>>"
