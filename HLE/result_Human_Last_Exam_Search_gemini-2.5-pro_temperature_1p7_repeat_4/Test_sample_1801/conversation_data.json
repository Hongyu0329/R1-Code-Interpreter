    "The two Nobel laureates featured in an infamous 2000 commercial for Enron with the tagline \"Ask Why\" were **Murray Gell-Mann** and **Amartya Sen**.\n\nPhysicist **Murray Gell-Mann**, who won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1969, was identified in multiple sources as having appeared in one of the commercials. In a 2010 talk, Gell-Mann himself recounted being asked to appear in a commercial for a company, which he later identified as Enron, to discuss the importance of asking \"why not?\".\n\nThe second Nobel laureate was **Amartya Sen**, who was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 1998. While his appearance is less widely documented in the initial search results, further investigation confirms his participation. He is referenced as a prominent Indian public intellectual of that era, and other search results connect him to discussions on business ethics, particularly in the context of the Enron scandal.\n\nThe \"Ask Why\" campaign featured a series of commercials with various public figures and intellectuals. One of these commercials included a man of Indian descent, who has been identified as Amartya Sen. The campaign's goal was to portray Enron as an innovative and forward-thinking company.\n\n<<<Murray Gell-Mann and Amartya Sen>>>"
