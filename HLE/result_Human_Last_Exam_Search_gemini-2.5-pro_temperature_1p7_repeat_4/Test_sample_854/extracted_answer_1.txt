The laboratory made a mistake in believing Batch 3 was safe to use due to a combination of a flawed quality control check, the degradation of the antibiotic during improper sterilization, and the disregard of aseptic techniques. The QC with *Bacillus subtilis* gave misleading results, and the extended autoclaving of Batch 3 likely reduced the efficacy of the chloramphenicol, allowing the airborne *Bacillus* contaminants (that entered the exposed bottles) to grow.
