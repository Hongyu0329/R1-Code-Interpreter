    "An analysis of Academy Award for Best Picture winners reveals that the first confirmed depiction of a Luxor Obelisk appears in the 1951 film *An American in Paris*.\n\nSeveral earlier Best Picture winners were considered due to their settings. Notably, *The Life of Emile Zola* (1937) is set almost entirely in Paris. Given that the historical figure Ã‰mile Zola lived and worked in Paris during a period of significant architectural changes, it was a strong candidate. However, a review of available plot summaries and film stills did not yield any images of the Place de la Concorde, where the Luxor Obelisk is located.\n\nAnother prominent candidate was *Casablanca* (1943), which features a famous flashback sequence in Paris. This montage includes iconic landmarks such as the Arc de Triomphe and the Eiffel Tower. However, detailed descriptions and clips of this sequence do not show the Luxor Obelisk, and the scenes were largely filmed on a studio backlot.\n\nThe first Best Picture winner for which there is clear evidence of the obelisk's depiction is *An American in Paris*. The film features a lavish ballet sequence with sets designed in the style of various French impressionist painters. One of these sets was specifically created to represent the Place de la Concorde and included a model of one of its famous fountains, situating the action at the location of the Luxor Obelisk.\n\n<<<An American in Paris>>>"
