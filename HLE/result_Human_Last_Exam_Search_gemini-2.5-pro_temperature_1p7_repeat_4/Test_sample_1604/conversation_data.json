    "The latest historical battle depicted in a painting by Lady Butler is the Affair at Huj, which took place on November 8, 1917, during the First World War. The painting immortalizing this event is titled *The Charge of the Warwickshire and Worcestershire Yeomanry at Huj*.\n\nElizabeth Thompson, later known as Lady Butler, was a prominent British painter renowned for her detailed and realistic scenes of British military campaigns. While she painted scenes from numerous conflicts of the 19th century, including the Napoleonic Wars, Crimean War, and various colonial wars, her work also extended to depicting events of the First World War.\n\nSeveral of her paintings portray events from World War I:\n*   ***The Retreat from Mons***: This painting shows the British Army's retreat in August 1914.\n*   **A painting of the London Irish Rifles at Loos**: This work depicts the unit's charge during the Battle of Loos in September 1915.\n*   ***A Detachment of Cavalry in Flanders***: This oil painting, completed in 1929, portrays a scene from the First World War.\n\nThe Battle of Huj, fought in Palestine, was a cavalry charge by the British 5th Mounted Brigade against an Ottoman and Central Powers rearguard. This engagement is considered one of the last classic unsupported cavalry charges in British military history and was successfully captured on canvas by Lady Butler. Of all the specific battles she depicted, the engagement at Huj is the latest, occurring just a year before the end of the war.\n\n<<<The Charge of the Warwickshire and Worcestershire Yeomanry at Huj>>>"
