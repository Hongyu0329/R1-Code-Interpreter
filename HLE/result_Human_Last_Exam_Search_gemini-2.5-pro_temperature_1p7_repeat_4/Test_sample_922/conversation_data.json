    "As of August 2022, the single known integer value that completes the sequence is **237515**.\n\nThe complete sequence represents the smallest integer that can be written as the sum of six 5th powers in two different ways. The solution was discovered by a team of mathematicians and announced in a preprint in August 2022.\n\nThe two sets of numbers that, when raised to the 5th power and summed, equal 237515 are:\n\n*   24663\n*   35005\n*   119261\n*   196219\n*   211770\n*   227296\n\nAnd the second set is:\n\n*   4295\n*   74284\n*   109816\n*   183319\n*   212164\n*   226927\n\nTherefore:\n\n24663⁵ + 35005⁵ + 119261⁵ + 196219⁵ + 211770⁵ + 227296⁵ = 237515\n\nand\n\n4295⁵ + 74284⁵ + 109816⁵ + 183319⁵ + 212164⁵ + 226927⁵ = 237515\n\nThis discovery is a counterexample to a variation of Euler's sum of powers conjecture.\n\n<<<237515>>>"
