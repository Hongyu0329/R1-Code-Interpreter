    "The problem asks to evaluate the definite integral of `F₃'(x)/F₃(x)` from 0 to 1 and then report the closest integer to 10,000 times this value.\n\nFirst, we analyze the integral `∫ (F₃'(x)/F₃(x)) dx`. This form of an integral, `∫ (f'(x)/f(x)) dx`, evaluates to `ln|f(x)| + C`. For a definite integral, we evaluate this at the limits of integration.\n\nThe functions are defined as:\n*   `F₀(x) = x`\n*   `F₁(x) = sin(F₀(x)) = sin(x)`\n*   `F₂(x) = e^(F₁(x)) = e^(sin(x))`\n*   `F₃(x) = ln(1 + F₂(x)) = ln(1 + e^(sin(x)))`\n\nThe definite integral is `[ln|F₃(x)|]` evaluated from 0 to 1, which is `ln|F₃(1)| - ln|F₃(0)|`.\n\nNext, we calculate the values of `F₃(x)` at the limits of integration:\n*   At `x = 1`:\n    `F₃(1) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))`\n*   At `x = 0`:\n    `F₁(0) = sin(0) = 0`\n    `F₂(0) = e⁰ = 1`\n    `F₃(0) = ln(1 + 1) = ln(2)`\n\nFor the interval `x ∈ [0, 1]`, `sin(x)` is between 0 and sin(1), so `e^(sin(x))` is between `e⁰=1` and `e^(sin(1))`. Therefore, `1 + e^(sin(x))` is always greater than 2, and `F₃(x) = ln(1 + e^(sin(x)))` is always greater than `ln(2)`, which is positive. Thus, the absolute value signs can be omitted.\n\nThe value of the integral, let's call it `V`, is:\n`V = ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0))`\n`V = ln(ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))) - ln(ln(2))`\n\nUsing the logarithm property `ln(a) - ln(b) = ln(a/b)`, we can write:\n`V = ln( ln(1 + e^(sin(1))) / ln(2) )`\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value:\n1.  `sin(1)` (radian) ≈ 0.84147\n2.  `e^(sin(1))` ≈ `e^0.84147` ≈ 2.31978\n3.  `F₃(1)` = `ln(1 + 2.31978)` = `ln(3.31978)` ≈ 1.19985\n4.  `F₃(0)` = `ln(2)` ≈ 0.69315\n5.  `V = ln(1.19985) - ln(0.69315)` ≈ 0.18220 - (-0.36652) ≈ 0.54872\n\nFinally, we multiply this value by 10,000:\n`10000 * V` ≈ `10000 * 0.54872` = `5487.2`\n\nThe closest integer to 5487.2 is 5487.\n\n<<<5487>>>"
