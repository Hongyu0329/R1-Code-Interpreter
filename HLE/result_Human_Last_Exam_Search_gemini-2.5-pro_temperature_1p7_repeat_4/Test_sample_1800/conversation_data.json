    "The ideal nickel-to-cerium (Ni/Ce) ratio in Ni-Ceria nanoparticles for maximizing catalytic performance is highly dependent on the specific chemical reaction, namely the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction or water splitting (WS). The optimal ratio is influenced by factors such as the presence of dopants and specific reaction conditions.\n\n### Water Gas Shift (WGS) Reaction\n\nFor the WGS reaction, which converts carbon monoxide and water to carbon dioxide and hydrogen, the optimal nickel content generally falls within a specific range rather than a single point.\n\nStudies on Ni/CeO₂ catalysts have shown that CO conversion is high for nickel content between 5 to 12.5 wt%. Specifically, catalysts with 10 and 12.5 wt% Ni loading demonstrated nearly identical and high CO conversion rates of 94.7% and 95.3%, respectively, at 400°C.\n\nWhen ceria is doped with other elements, the optimal ratio can change. For instance, in lanthanum-doped ceria (Ni/La-CeO₂) used for the reverse WGS reaction, an optimum Ni proportion of approximately 7% molar has been reported. In another case involving tungsten as a co-dopant, a Ni₀.₂W₀.₁Ce₀.₇O₂ catalyst, which has a Ni/Ce molar ratio of about 1:3.5, exhibited the highest catalytic activity.\n\n### Water Splitting (WS)\n\nIn the case of water splitting, which consists of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), the ideal Ni/Ce ratio differs for each half-reaction.\n\n*   **Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER):** For the OER, a higher proportion of nickel appears to be more effective. Research on NiᵧCe₁₀₀₋ᵧOₓ electrocatalysts has identified that **Ni₇₅Ce₂₅Oₓ** (a 3:1 Ni/Ce molar ratio) and **Ni₅₀Ce₅₀Oₓ** (a 1:1 Ni/Ce molar ratio) show the highest OER activities. The superior performance of these ratios is linked to a larger concentration of oxygen vacancies. The Ni₇₅Ce₂₅Oₓ catalyst, in particular, has also been noted for its excellent long-term stability.\n\n*   **Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER):** For the HER, a higher concentration of ceria is beneficial. A study focusing on Ni₃N-CeO₂ catalysts found that a **Ce/Ni molar ratio of 2** (a 1:2 Ni/Ce ratio) yielded the best HER performance.\n\n*   **Overall Water Splitting:** For bifunctional catalysts designed for overall water splitting, balanced or complex ratios are often employed. For example, a catalyst with Ni and Fe co-doping in CeO₂ at a 20 mol% concentration with a Ni:Fe ratio of 1:1 has demonstrated excellent performance for both HER and OER. Another effective catalyst was formulated with a Ni:Fe:Ce molar ratio of 1:1:1.\n\nIn summary, there is no single ideal Ni/Ce ratio that maximizes catalytic performance for both the WGS reaction and water splitting. For the WGS reaction, a nickel content of **5 to 12.5 wt%** is generally effective. For water splitting, a higher nickel content (e.g., Ni:Ce of 3:1 or 1:1) is preferred for OER, while a lower nickel content (e.g., Ni:Ce of 1:2) is optimal for HER.\n\n<<<The ideal Ni/Ce ratio is reaction-dependent. For the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction, a range of 5 to 12.5 wt% Ni is optimal. For water splitting, the Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER) is maximized with higher Ni content (Ni:Ce of 3:1 or 1:1), while the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER) is most efficient with a lower Ni content (Ni:Ce of 1:2).>>>"
