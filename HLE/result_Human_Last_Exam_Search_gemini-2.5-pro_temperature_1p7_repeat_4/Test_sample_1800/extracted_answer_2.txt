The ideal Ni/Ce ratio is reaction-dependent. For the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction, a range of 5 to 12.5 wt% Ni is optimal. For water splitting, the Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER) is maximized with higher Ni content (Ni:Ce of 3:1 or 1:1), while the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER) is most efficient with a lower Ni content (Ni:Ce of 1:2).
