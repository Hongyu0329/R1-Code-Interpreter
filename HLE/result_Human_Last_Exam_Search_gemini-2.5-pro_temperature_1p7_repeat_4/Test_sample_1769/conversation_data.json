    "If the Norse had never invaded and interacted with the Anglo-Saxons, the Modern English word for \"sister\" would almost certainly not be \"sister.\" Instead, it would likely be a word like **suster** or **souster**, rhyming with \"duster.\"\n\nHere is the reasoning behind this conclusion:\n\n*   **The Original Anglo-Saxon Word**: The Old English word for a female sibling was **sweostor** (pronounced roughly \"sweh-os-tor\"). This word existed in several dialectical forms, such as `swuster` and `swester`.\n\n*   **Norse Influence**: The current word, \"sister,\" is a hybrid. During the Viking Age, Old Norse speakers settled in large parts of England. Their word for sister was `systir`. The interaction between Old English and Old Norse speakers led to the Old English `sweostor` being influenced and eventually superseded by a version containing the \"i\" vowel from the Old Norse word.\n\n*   **A Separate Evolutionary Path**: Without the influence from `systir`, the native Old English `sweostor` would have evolved naturally. Historical linguists trace this path by observing how similar words developed. The `sweostor` form became **suster** in Middle English.\n\n*   **From Middle to Modern English**: The next step is to project how \"suster\" would have changed from Middle English to today. The short \"u\" sound in Middle English, as in `suster`, typically evolved into the modern STRUT vowel (/ÊŒ/), the sound we hear in words like \"cup,\" \"dull,\" and \"son.\"\n\nTherefore, had the Old English `sweostor` been allowed to evolve without Norse linguistic contact, it would have resulted in a word spelled as `suster` or `souster` and pronounced with a short 'u' sound.\n\n<<<suster>>>"
