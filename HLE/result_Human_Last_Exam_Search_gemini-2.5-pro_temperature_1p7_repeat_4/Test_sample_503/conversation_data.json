    "An internal adjunction in the simplex category $\\Delta$, when viewed as a locally posetal 2-subcategory of the category of posets $\\mathsf{Pos}$, consists of a pair of order-preserving maps, $f: [m] \\to [n]$ and $g: [n] \\to [m]$, that satisfy two conditions:\n1.  The identity morphism on $[m]$ is less than or equal to the composition $g \\circ f$. This means that for every element $i$ in $[m] = \\{0, 1, \\dots, m\\}$, the inequality $i \\le g(f(i))$ must hold.\n2.  The composition $f \\circ g$ is less than or equal to the identity morphism on $[n]$. This means that for every element $j$ in $[n] = \\{0, 1, \\dots, n\\}$, the inequality $f(g(j)) \\le j$ must hold.\n\nThe problem of counting such adjunctions between two finite totally ordered sets (chains) is a known result in category theory. The number of internal adjunctions from the object $[m]$ to the object $[n]$ is given by the binomial coefficient $\\binom{m+n}{m}$.\n\nThis result can be established by showing a bijection between the set of such adjunctions and the set of monotone paths on a grid, or equivalently, the set of order ideals in a product of two chains. An adjunction corresponds to a \"lower set\" in the product poset $[m] \\times [n]^{\\text{op}}$, and the number of these is $\\binom{m+n}{m}$.\n\nIn this specific problem, we are asked for the number of internal adjunctions from $$ to $$. Thus, we have $m=23$ and $n=37$.\n\nApplying the formula, the number of adjunctions is:\n$$ \\binom{23 + 37}{23} = \\binom{60}{23} $$\n\nThis binomial coefficient can be calculated as:\n$$ \\binom{60}{23} = \\frac{60!}{23! \\cdot (60-23)!} = \\frac{60!}{23! \\cdot 37!} $$\n\nThe exact value is 42,239,075,723,381,186,000.\n\n<<<42239075723381186000>>>"
