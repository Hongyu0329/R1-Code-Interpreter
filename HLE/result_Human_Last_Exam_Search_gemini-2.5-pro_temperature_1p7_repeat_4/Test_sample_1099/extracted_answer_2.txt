To simulate the correlations from general POVM measurements on a singlet bipartite quantum state using a local hidden variable model, the minimal average resources required are **2 bits of classical communication**. If using non-signaling PR-boxes, the resource requirement is more complex; while 1 PR-box suffices for projective measurements, general POVMs may necessitate **more than one PR-box** or a hybrid approach that also includes classical communication.
