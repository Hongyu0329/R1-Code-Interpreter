    "Based on the research conducted, there is no evidence to support the claim that a unique architectural feature was removed from the \"Piazza della Rotonda\" in 1950.\n\nHistorical records and extensive searches show various modifications to the piazza and the adjacent Pantheon over the centuries. These include the addition of the central fountain in the 16th century and the Egyptian obelisk in the 18th century. In the 19th century, the piazza, which had served as a market for fish and birds, was cleared of its stalls, and a fence that was placed around the fountain was eventually removed.\n\nSignificant changes to the Pantheon itself include the removal of its bronze roof tiles in the 7th century and, most notably, the demolition of two bell towers—often derisively called \"the ass's ears\"—from the Pantheon's facade in the late 1880s, not from the piazza itself.\n\nWhile major architectural and demolition projects did occur in Rome around the mid-20th century, none of the available information indicates any specific architectural feature being removed from the Piazza della Rotonda in or around the year 1950. Therefore, the premise of the question cannot be confirmed.\n\n<<<There is no historical evidence of a unique architectural feature being removed from the Piazza della Rotonda in 1950.>>>"
