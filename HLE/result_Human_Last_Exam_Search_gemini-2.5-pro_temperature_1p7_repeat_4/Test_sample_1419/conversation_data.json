    "In the ϕ⁴ theory near four dimensions, the leading order expression for the Wilson-Fisher fixed point coupling, denoted as u*, is directly proportional to ε, where ε = 4 - d and 'd' is the number of spatial dimensions.\n\nThe value of the fixed point coupling is determined by finding the non-trivial zero of the theory's beta function. The beta function describes how the coupling constant changes with the energy scale. To the leading order in ε, the beta function for the coupling 'u' is given by:\n\nβ(u) = -εu + Bu²\n\nHere, 'B' is a constant that depends on the specific normalization conventions used for the coupling constant. The fixed point u* is found by setting β(u*) = 0, which yields a non-trivial solution.\n\nThe leading order expression for the fixed point coupling u* is:\n\nu* = ε / B\n\nThe constant B varies depending on the conventions used in defining the coupling constant 'u'. A common convention in many textbooks leads to the expression where B = 3 / (16π²), giving:\n\nu* = (16π² / 3)ε\n\nAnother convention results in B being (N+8)/(8π²) for an O(N) symmetric model. For the single-component ϕ⁴ theory (N=1), this gives B = 9/(8π²), resulting in:\n\nu* = (8π² / 9)ε.\n\nRegardless of the specific normalization, the crucial result is that the fixed point coupling u* is of the order of ε. This non-trivial fixed point governs the critical behavior of the system and is a key prediction of the renormalization group analysis of the ϕ⁴ theory.\n\n<<<u* = (16π² / 3)ε>>>"
