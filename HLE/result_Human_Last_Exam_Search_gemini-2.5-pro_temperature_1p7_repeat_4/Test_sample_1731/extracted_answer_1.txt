The equilibrium values of entropy and mean energy for the Bose case of the light quanta are determined by the Bose-Einstein distribution. This distribution is found by minimizing the rate function from the Boltzmann-Sanov theorem, subject to the constraint of a fixed total energy. The Cramer-Chernoff theorem further solidifies the understanding of the mean energy by quantifying the probability of its deviations from the equilibrium value. The resulting equilibrium entropy is calculated from the statistical weight of the Bose-Einstein distribution, and the mean energy is the average energy of this distribution, which is consistent with Planck's law of black-body radiation.
