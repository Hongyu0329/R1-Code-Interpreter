    "### Large Deviation Theorems Illuminate Equilibrium in Photon Gas\n\nThe equilibrium values of entropy and mean energy for the Bose case of light quanta, fundamental concepts in quantum statistics, can be elegantly derived using the powerful framework of large deviation theory, specifically through the application of the Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramer-Chernoff theorems. These theorems provide a rigorous mathematical foundation for the principles of statistical mechanics, explaining how macroscopic equilibrium states emerge from microscopic laws.\n\nAt its core, large deviation theory deals with the probabilities of rare events. In the context of a system of many particles, such as a photon gas, the macroscopic properties we observe, like temperature and pressure, are averages of microscopic properties. While these macroscopic values are overwhelmingly likely to be near their equilibrium values, there's a tiny, but non-zero, probability of observing a significant deviation. Large deviation theorems quantify this small probability.\n\n**Sanov's Theorem and the Emergence of Equilibrium**\n\nSanov's theorem is particularly insightful for understanding the emergence of equilibrium distributions. It states that the probability of an empirical distribution (the observed distribution of particles among different energy states) deviating from the true underlying distribution decreases exponentially with the number of particles. The rate of this exponential decay is given by the relative entropy (or Kullback-Leibler divergence) between the empirical distribution and the true one.\n\nFor a gas of photons (bosons) in thermal equilibrium, the system will be found in the macroscopic state that corresponds to the largest number of microscopic configurations. In the language of large deviation theory, this most probable macrostate is the one with the smallest rate function. According to Sanov's theorem, minimizing the rate function is equivalent to minimizing the relative entropy with respect to the underlying distribution, subject to the physical constraints of the system.\n\nIn the case of a photon gas, the key constraint is the total energy of the system. By minimizing the relative entropy of the distribution of photons across energy levels, subject to a fixed total energy, one arrives precisely at the Bose-Einstein distribution for photons. This distribution describes the number of photons occupying each energy level at thermal equilibrium.\n\n**Cramer-Chernoff Theorem and Mean Energy**\n\nThe Cramer-Chernoff theorem complements Sanov's theorem by providing a tool to calculate the probability of deviations in the *average* of a set of random variables. This is directly applicable to finding the equilibrium mean energy of the photon gas. The theorem states that the probability of the empirical mean energy deviating from its expected value also decays exponentially, and it provides a way to calculate the \"rate function\" for this deviation using the moment generating function of the energy distribution.\n\nThe equilibrium state is the one that maximizes the probability of observing a particular mean energy, which, according to the Cramer-Chernoff theorem, corresponds to the minimum of the rate function. This minimization procedure, when applied to the Bose-Einstein distribution derived from Sanov's theorem, yields the well-known formula for the average energy of a photon gas, which is directly related to Planck's law for black-body radiation.\n\nIn essence, these large deviation theorems provide a powerful and rigorous framework for understanding why a photon gas settles into the Bose-Einstein distribution at equilibrium. They formalize the intuitive idea that the system will overwhelmingly be found in the state that is consistent with the largest number of microscopic arrangements.\n\nOnce the Bose-Einstein distribution is established as the equilibrium distribution, the equilibrium values for entropy and mean energy can be calculated directly from it. The entropy is given by the Boltzmann formula, S = k_B * ln(W), where W is the number of microstates corresponding to the Bose-Einstein distribution, and k_B is the Boltzmann constant. The mean energy is found by summing the energy of each state multiplied by its occupation number as given by the Bose-Einstein statistics. A recent study has explicitly shown that applying the Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramer-Chernoff theorems allows for the calculation of these large deviation probabilities and, consequently, the entropies and rate functions for the spatial and energy distributions of photons, reproducing the results of Bose and Planck within this theoretical framework.\n\n<<<The equilibrium values of entropy and mean energy for the Bose case of the light quanta are determined by the Bose-Einstein distribution. This distribution is found by minimizing the rate function from the Boltzmann-Sanov theorem, subject to the constraint of a fixed total energy. The Cramer-Chernoff theorem further solidifies the understanding of the mean energy by quantifying the probability of its deviations from the equilibrium value. The resulting equilibrium entropy is calculated from the statistical weight of the Bose-Einstein distribution, and the mean energy is the average energy of this distribution, which is consistent with Planck's law of black-body radiation.>>>"
