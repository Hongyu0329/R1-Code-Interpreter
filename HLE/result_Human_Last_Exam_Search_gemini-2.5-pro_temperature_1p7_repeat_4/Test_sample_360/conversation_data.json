    "When the ligand 2,5-di(2-pyridyl)thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole (dptztz) is reacted with *cis*-dichlorobis(bipyridine)ruthenium(II) (`cis-[Ru(bpy)2Cl2]`), a dinuclear complex is formed rather than a simple mononuclear species. The dptztz ligand acts as a bridging ligand, connecting two ruthenium centers.\n\nThe reaction with two equivalents of `cis-[Ru(bpy)2Cl2]` yields a dinuclear complex with the formula `[{Ru(bpy)2}2(µ-dptztz)]^4+`. Each ruthenium center in this complex is chiral, designated as either delta (Δ) or lambda (Λ).\n\nThe combination of the two chiral ruthenium centers leads to the formation of two diastereoisomers. These isomers are:\n*   A **meso** form, which has both a Δ and a Λ configuration at the metal centers (Δ,Λ). This isomer possesses a center of inversion.\n*   A **racemic** mixture, which consists of a pair of enantiomers where both metal centers have the same configuration (Δ,Δ and Λ,Λ).\n\nThese two diastereomers, the meso and the racemic pair, are formed in the reaction, typically in a 2:1 ratio, and can be separated by methods such as cation exchange chromatography. Therefore, two diastereomeric products are formed.\n\n<<<2>>>"
