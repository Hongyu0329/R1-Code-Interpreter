    "The reaction of N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide with sec-BuLi and TMEDA in THF, followed by the addition of methyl iodide, yields N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide.\n\nThis process is a classic example of a directed ortho-metalation (DoM) reaction. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the chemical transformation:\n\n1.  **Directed ortho-Metalation:**\n    *   The starting molecule, N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide, has two functional groups that can direct the metalation: the N,N-diethylamide group (-CON(C₂H₅)₂) at position 1 and the dimethylamino group (-N(CH₃)₂) at position 3 of the benzene ring.\n    *   Both of these are known as Directed Metalation Groups (DMGs) because they can coordinate to the lithium atom of the organolithium reagent. The tertiary amide group is considered a stronger DMG than the tertiary amine group.\n    *   Sec-butyllithium (sec-BuLi) is a very strong base, and its reactivity is enhanced by the presence of tetramethylethylenediamine (TMEDA), which breaks down the sec-BuLi aggregates and chelates the lithium ion.\n    *   The position on the ring that is *ortho* to both directing groups (the C2 position) is the most acidic. The sec-BuLi selectively removes the proton from this position, forming an aryllithium intermediate. The directing groups synergistically activate this specific position for deprotonation.\n\n2.  **Electrophilic Quench:**\n    *   The newly formed aryllithium species is a potent nucleophile.\n    *   When methyl iodide (CH₃I) is introduced into the reaction mixture, the aryllithium attacks the electrophilic methyl group.\n    *   This results in the formation of a new carbon-carbon bond, with the methyl group being attached to the C2 position of the aromatic ring, displacing the lithium.\n\nThe final compound obtained is **N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide**.\n\n<<<N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide>>>"
