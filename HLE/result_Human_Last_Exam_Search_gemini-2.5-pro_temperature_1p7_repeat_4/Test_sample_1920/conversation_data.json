    "To find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters $\\chi$ of conductor $d=53599$ and order 6, we will follow these steps:\n\n### 1. Prime Factorization of the Conductor\nFirst, we need to find the prime factorization of the conductor $d = 53599$.\nA search reveals the prime factorization of 53599.\n$d = 7 \\times 13 \\times 19 \\times 31$.\nThe conductor is a square-free integer, which simplifies the problem.\n\n### 2. Structure of Primitive Dirichlet Characters\nA Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo a square-free integer $d = p_1 p_2 \\dots p_k$ is primitive if and only if it can be written as a product $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\dots \\chi_k$, where each $\\chi_i$ is a non-trivial (and therefore primitive) character modulo the prime $p_i$.\n\nThe order of the character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its constituent characters: $\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_1), \\text{ord}(\\chi_2), \\dots, \\text{ord}(\\chi_k))$.\n\nWe need the order of $\\chi$ to be 6. This implies that for the set of orders of the component characters $\\{\\text{ord}(\\chi_1), \\text{ord}(\\chi_2), \\text{ord}(\\chi_3), \\text{ord}(\\chi_4)\\}$, the lcm must be 6. This requires that at least one component character has an order divisible by 2, and at least one has an order divisible by 3. Also, the order of each component character must be a divisor of 6.\n\n### 3. Characters of Prime Modulus\nFor a prime modulus $p$, the group of Dirichlet characters is cyclic of order $\\phi(p) = p-1$. The number of characters of order $k$ is $\\phi(k)$ if $k$ divides $p-1$, and 0 otherwise. Any non-trivial character modulo a prime is primitive.\n\nLet's check the values of $p-1$ for the prime factors of $d=53599$:\n*   For $p=7$, $p-1=6$. Since 6 is divisible by 2, 3, and 6, there are primitive characters of these orders.\n*   For $p=13$, $p-1=12$. Since 12 is divisible by 2, 3, and 6, there are primitive characters of these orders.\n*   For $p=19$, $p-1=18$. Since 18 is divisible by 2, 3, and 6, there are primitive characters of these orders.\n*   For $p=31$, $p-1=30$. Since 30 is divisible by 2, 3, and 6, there are primitive characters of these orders.\n\nFor each of the four prime factors of $d$, we need to count the number of primitive characters whose order divides 6. These are the characters of order 1, 2, 3, or 6. Since the characters must be non-trivial to be components of a primitive character modulo $d$, we exclude order 1.\nThe number of primitive characters modulo $p$ for orders 2, 3, and 6 is:\n*   Number of characters of order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$.\n*   Number of characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n*   Number of characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$.\n\nFor each prime factor, there are $1 + 2 + 2 = 5$ possible choices for a component character whose order is a divisor of 6 (and greater than 1).\n\n### 4. Counting the Characters using Inclusion-Exclusion\nWe want to construct a primitive character $\\chi = \\chi_7 \\chi_{13} \\chi_{19} \\chi_{31}$ of order 6. For each prime factor, we select a non-trivial character $\\chi_p$ whose order divides 6.\n\n*   Total number of primitive characters with order dividing 6: Since there are 4 prime factors and 5 choices for each, the total is $5 \\times 5 \\times 5 \\times 5 = 5^4 = 625$.\n\nThis total includes characters whose order is a proper divisor of 6 (i.e., 1, 2, or 3). As we are only using non-trivial characters, the order cannot be 1. We must subtract the characters whose order is 2 or 3.\n\n*   Number of characters with order dividing 2: For the order of $\\chi$ to divide 2, the order of each component $\\chi_p$ must divide 2. There is $\\phi(2)=1$ such character for each prime. So there are $1^4 = 1$ such character. This character has order 2.\n\n*   Number of characters with order dividing 3: For the order of $\\chi$ to divide 3, the order of each component $\\chi_p$ must divide 3. There are $\\phi(3)=2$ such characters for each prime. So there are $2^4 = 16$ such characters. These characters have order 3.\n\nThe number of characters whose order is exactly 6 is the total number of characters with order dividing 6, minus those with an order that properly divides 6.\nNumber of characters of order 6 = (Number of characters with order dividing 6) - (Number of characters with order dividing 2) - (Number of characters with order dividing 3).\n\nNumber of characters of order 6 = $625 - 1 - 16 = 608$.\n\nFinal Answer is 608.\n\n<<<608>>>"
