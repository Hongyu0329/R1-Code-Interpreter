    "Based on an extensive search, there is no major Hollywood feature film that precisely matches the description of a teenager riding a pink bike and pedaling directly toward an oncoming car.\n\nWhile numerous films feature teenagers, bicycles, and vehicle stunts, the specific combination of a pink bicycle in a game of \"chicken\" with a car does not appear in readily available film databases, synopses, or discussions. It is possible the film is a lesser-known independent movie, a made-for-television film, or the details of the scene might be misremembered.\n\nSearches have included various combinations of keywords such as \"teenager on pink bike plays chicken with car,\" \"Hollywood movie girl on pink bike swerves in front of car,\" and similar queries across different genres and decades, none of which have yielded a definitive result. Forum discussions on movie identification sites also do not contain a conclusive answer to this specific scene.\n\nTherefore, the movie in question cannot be identified at this time.\n\n<<<The requested Hollywood feature film cannot be identified based on the provided description.>>>"
