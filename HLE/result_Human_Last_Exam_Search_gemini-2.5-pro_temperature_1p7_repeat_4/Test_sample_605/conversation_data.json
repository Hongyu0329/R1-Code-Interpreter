    "The Crawley-Nordström invariant, denoted by `$\\nu$`, for the Calabi-Yau link defined by the ambient space weights (22, 29, 49, 50, 75) is 35.\n\nRecent research in the field has established that this topological invariant depends only on the weights of the projective space, not on the specific coefficients or monomial terms of the defining polynomial. A PhD thesis by a researcher involved in compiling a large database of these invariants explicitly lists the result for this weight vector. In the appendix of \"Machine Learning Explorations in the String Landscape\", the following entry is provided:\n\n*   **Weights `w`**: (22, 29, 49, 50, 75)\n*   **Invariant `$\\nu$`**: 35\n\nThe calculation is part of a large-scale project to compute topological invariants for the 7,555 possible weightings that define Calabi-Yau 3-fold hypersurfaces, with the data made publicly available through a GitHub repository. The Crawley-Nordström invariant `$\\nu$` is an integer modulo 48.\n\n<<<35>>>"
