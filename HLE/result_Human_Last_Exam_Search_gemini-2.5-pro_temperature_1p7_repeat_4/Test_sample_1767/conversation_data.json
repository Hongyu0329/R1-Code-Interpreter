    "When two Chern insulators with Chern number 1 are connected laterally with a negligible tunneling barrier, the Chern number of the junction, understood as the number of chiral edge states at the interface, is 0.\n\nThis conclusion is based on a fundamental principle in the study of topological materials: the number of topologically protected conducting channels (chiral edge states) at the interface between two topologically distinct regions is given by the difference in their topological invariants, in this case, the Chern numbers.\n\nLet the two Chern insulators be denoted by regions 1 and 2, with corresponding Chern numbers C₁ and C₂. The number of chiral edge states, N, at the junction between them is given by the formula:\n\nN = |C₁ - C₂|\n\nIn this specific case, both Chern insulators have a Chern number of 1. Therefore, C₁ = 1 and C₂ = 1. Plugging these values into the formula gives:\n\nN = |1 - 1| = 0\n\nThis means that there are no topologically protected gapless states at the interface. Since the two insulators have the same Chern number, they are considered to be in the same topological phase, and their junction does not necessitate the closing of the energy gap that would give rise to edge states. The system as a whole can be characterized by a single Chern number of 1, except for the trivial interface.\n\nWhile it is possible to engineer heterostructures with higher Chern numbers, often by stacking materials where the resulting Chern number is the sum of the individual layers, this principle does not apply to a lateral junction. For a lateral junction, the key feature is the difference in the topological invariants of the adjacent domains.\n\n<<<0>>>"
