    "This sequence appears to be a custom puzzle or code rather than a standard mathematical sequence, as extensive searches did not reveal a known pattern. However, by analyzing the structure and repetitions within the sequence, a possible pattern emerges at the end.\n\nThe final portion of the sequence is: ..., 36, 36, 36, 124, 124, 124, 36, 124.\n\nLet's examine the tail of the sequence: 36, 124. This could be interpreted as the beginning of an alternating pattern. If this is the case, the sequence would continue by repeating these two numbers.\n\nTherefore, the next number in the sequence would be 36.\n\n<<<36>>>"
