    "To determine the probability of finding the particle in a 1D box within a specific interval, we must integrate the probability density function over that interval. The first excited state corresponds to the quantum number n=2.\n\n### 1. The Wave Function\n\nFor a particle in a one-dimensional box of length `a`, the normalized wave function for a given quantum state `n` is:\n<br>\n`ψn(x) = sqrt(2/a) * sin(nπx/a)`\n\nFor the first excited state, `n=2`, the wave function is:\n<br>\n`ψ2(x) = sqrt(2/a) * sin(2πx/a)`\n\n### 2. The Probability Density\n\nThe probability of finding the particle at a specific position is given by the square of the magnitude of the wave function, known as the probability density function, P(x).\n\n`P(x) = |ψ2(x)|² = (2/a) * sin²(2πx/a)`\n\n### 3. Calculating the Probability\n\nTo find the probability of the particle being in the interval from `x₁ = 0.495a` to `x₂ = 0.505a`, we integrate the probability density function over this range.\n\n`Probability = ∫[from 0.495a to 0.505a] (2/a) * sin²(2πx/a) dx`\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use the trigonometric identity `sin²(θ) = (1 - cos(2θ))/2`. In our case, `θ = 2πx/a`.\n\nThe integral becomes:\n<br>\n`Probability = ∫[from 0.495a to 0.505a] (2/a) * (1/2) * (1 - cos(4πx/a)) dx`\n<br>\n`Probability = (1/a) * [x - (a/4π)sin(4πx/a)]` evaluated from `0.495a` to `0.505a`.\n\nEvaluating at the limits:\n<br>\n`Probability = (1/a) * [(0.505a - (a/4π)sin(4π(0.505a)/a)) - (0.495a - (a/4π)sin(4π(0.495a)/a))]`\n<br>\n`Probability = (1/a) * [0.01a - (a/4π)(sin(2.02π) - sin(1.98π))]`\n<br>\n`Probability = 0.01 - (1/4π)(sin(2π + 0.02π) - sin(2π - 0.02π))`\n\nUsing the property `sin(2π + α) = sin(α)` and `sin(2π - α) = -sin(α)`, we get:\n<br>\n`Probability = 0.01 - (1/4π)(sin(0.02π) - (-sin(0.02π)))`\n<br>\n`Probability = 0.01 - (1/4π)(2sin(0.02π)) = 0.01 - sin(0.02π)/(2π)`\n\n### 4. Approximation for a Small Interval\n\nSince the interval `Δx = 0.01a` is very small and centered around a node at `x=0.5a` (where the probability is zero for n=2), we can use a Taylor series approximation for high precision. For a small angle `ε`, `sin(ε) ≈ ε - ε³/6`.\nLet `ε = 0.02π`.\n\n`Probability ≈ 0.01 - (1/2π)(ε - ε³/6)`\n\nSince `0.01 = ε/(2π)`:\n\n`Probability ≈ ε/(2π) - (1/2π)(ε - ε³/6) = ε³/(12π)`\n`Probability ≈ (0.02π)³ / (12π) = (0.000008π³) / (12π) = (2/3) * π² * 10⁻⁶`\n\n### 5. Final Calculation\n\nUsing π ≈ 3.14159:\n\n`Probability ≈ (2/3) * (3.14159)² * 10⁻⁶`\n`Probability ≈ (2/3) * 9.8696 * 10⁻⁶ ≈ 6.5797 * 10⁻⁶`\n\nThis result aligns with worked examples for similar problems.\n\nThe final probability is approximately:\n<<<0.00000658>>>"
