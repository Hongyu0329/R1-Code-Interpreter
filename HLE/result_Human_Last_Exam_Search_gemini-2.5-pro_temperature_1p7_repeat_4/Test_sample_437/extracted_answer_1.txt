The result of the evaluation depends on whether the two orbitals $\phi_i$ and $\phi_j$ are the same.

**Case 1: General case with potentially different orbital exponents**
If $\phi_i$ and $\phi_j$ are two different 1s Slater orbitals centered on the same nucleus with orbital exponents $\zeta_i$ and $\zeta_j$ respectively, the value of the integral is:
\[
\langle \phi_i | \frac{1}{r} | \phi_j\rangle = \frac{4(\zeta_i\zeta_j)^{3/2}}{(\zeta_i+\zeta_j)^2}
\]

**Case 2: Expectation value where the orbitals are identical**
If the integral is an expectation value, meaning $\phi_i = \phi_j = \phi_{1s}$ with a single orbital exponent $\zeta$, the result simplifies to:
\[
\langle \phi_{1s} | \frac{1}{r} | \phi_{1s}\rangle = \zeta
\]
This second case is the most common interpretation of the question.
