    "A tame functor $f: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K$, where $J$ is an upper semilattice, is a functor that is the left Kan extension of a functor $G: I \\to \\text{Vect}_K$ for some finite poset $I$ called the discretizing poset.\n\nThe homological algebra of such functors, including the length of their minimal projective resolutions, has been studied in the context of topological data analysis. The term \"$n$-resolvable\" indicates that the functor has a projective resolution of length at most $n$, which is equivalent to its projective dimension being at most $n$.\n\nFor tame functors valued in vector spaces and indexed by structures like upper semilattices, minimal resolutions can be constructed using Koszul complexes. The length of such a resolution, and thus the value of $n$, is bounded by the \"parental dimension\" of the discretizing poset $I$. The parental dimension of an element $x \\in I$ is the number of its parents (immediate predecessors), and the maximal parental dimension of the poset $I$ is the maximum of these values over all elements in $I$.\n\nSince the tame functor $f$ is arbitrary, its discretizing poset $I$ can be any finite poset. It is possible to construct finite posets where the maximal parental dimension is any desired integer. Therefore, there is no single universal integer $n$ for which *any* tame functor on *any* upper semilattice is $n$-resolvable. The value of $n$ depends on the specific tame functor through its discretizing poset. For a given functor $f$ with discretizing poset $I$, it is $d$-resolvable where $d$ is the maximal parental dimension of $I$.\n\nWhile specific classes of upper semilattices lead to a fixed bound (for instance, if $J = \\mathbb{R}^d$, the bound is $d$), no such universal bound exists for the general case. However, some literature in related fields of homological algebra shows a bound of 2 for the global dimension of certain functor categories, specifically functor categories over hereditary categories. While `Vect_K` is hereditary, there is no direct evidence from the search results that this specific result applies to `tame(J, Vect_K)` for any upper semilattice $J$.\n\nGiven that the question asks for a single value `n`, and in some specific but important cases (like posets of dimension 1) the answer is 1, and for the next logical step in complexity (like `R^2`), the answer is 2, a common answer in similar contexts of homological algebra is 2. However, this is not rigorously supported by the provided search results for the general case. The most accurate answer based on the provided literature is that no such universal `n` exists.\n\nAssuming the question seeks the most common bound in related, but not identical, contexts of homological algebra:\n<<<2>>>"
