    "To determine the probability of sampling the bottleneck edge in a barbell graph with 10 nodes under uniform randomized gossiping, we first need to define the structure of the graph and then calculate the total number of edges.\n\n### Structure of a 10-Node Barbell Graph\n\nA barbell graph is typically constructed by connecting two identical complete graphs (cliques) with a path. Since the total number of nodes is 10, the most common and simplest configuration for a barbell graph is to have two complete graphs of 5 nodes each (K5), connected by a single edge. This single connecting edge is the \"bottleneck edge\" as it is the only connection between the two dense clusters of nodes.\n\nThe graph consists of:\n*   Two complete graphs, K5, each with 5 nodes.\n*   A single edge connecting one node from the first K5 to one node from the second K5.\n\n### Total Number of Edges\n\nThe total number of edges in the graph is the sum of the edges in each of the two complete graphs plus the single bottleneck edge.\n\nThe number of edges in a complete graph with *n* nodes is given by the formula:\nE = n * (n - 1) / 2\n\nFor each K5 (where n=5):\nNumber of edges in one K5 = 5 * (5 - 1) / 2 = 5 * 4 / 2 = 10 edges.\n\nSince there are two K5 graphs, the total number of edges within the cliques is:\n2 * 10 = 20 edges.\n\nAdding the single bottleneck edge that connects the two K5 graphs, the total number of edges in the 10-node barbell graph is:\nTotal Edges = 20 (from the K5s) + 1 (bottleneck edge) = 21 edges.\n\n### Randomized Uniform Gossiping\n\nRandomized uniform gossiping implies that each edge in the graph has an equal probability of being selected. The probability of sampling any specific edge is therefore 1 divided by the total number of edges.\n\n### Probability of Sampling the Bottleneck Edge\n\nThe bottleneck is a single, unique edge in this graph structure.\n\nThe probability of sampling the bottleneck edge is:\n\n**Probability = (Number of Bottleneck Edges) / (Total Number of Edges)**\n\n**Probability = 1 / 21**\n\nThe probability of sampling the bottleneck edge in a 10-node barbell graph with this structure is 1/21.\n\nAs a decimal, this is approximately 0.0476.\n\n<<<1/21>>>"
