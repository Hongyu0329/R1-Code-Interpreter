    "Pure allotropes of phosphorus can be observed in at least five distinct colors: white, red, violet, black, and blue.\n\nThe most common allotropes are white, red, and black phosphorus. White phosphorus is a translucent waxy solid that is colorless when pure but often appears yellow due to impurities, leading to the alternative name \"yellow phosphorus\". It can also have a white opaque coating due to oxidation.\n\nRed phosphorus has a deep red color. It can also exhibit an iron-grey luster. The color may darken upon extended heating or storage.\n\nBlack phosphorus is the most thermodynamically stable allotrope and appears as black, flaky crystals with a metallic luster, similar to graphite. It exists in two forms, α-black and β-black, both of which are black.\n\nViolet phosphorus, also known as Hittorf's metallic phosphorus, is a crystalline form with a violet or purple color. It can form brilliant, opaque monoclinic or rhombohedral crystals that may also appear red/purple.\n\nA more recently synthesized two-dimensional allotrope is known as blue phosphorus, which, as its name suggests, is blue.\n\nFinally, a gaseous form of phosphorus called diphosphorus exists at very high temperatures.\n\n<<<5>>>"
