    "In a 6-31G basis set calculation, the number of contracted Gaussian functions depends on the type of atom.\n\nFor toluene, with the chemical formula C₇H₈, we have:\n*   7 Carbon (C) atoms\n*   8 Hydrogen (H) atoms\n\nThe 6-31G basis set is a split-valence basis set. Here's how the functions are counted for each type of atom:\n\n*   **For each Carbon atom (a first-row element)**: The core 1s orbital is represented by one contracted function (from 6 primitive Gaussians). The valence 2s and 2p orbitals are each split into two basis functions: an inner part described by a contraction of 3 primitive Gaussians and an outer part represented by a single primitive Gaussian. This results in:\n    *   1 function for the 1s orbital\n    *   2 functions for the 2s orbital\n    *   2 functions for each of the three 2p orbitals (2 * 3 = 6)\n    *   Total for one Carbon atom = 1 + 2 + 6 = 9 contracted functions.\n\n*   **For each Hydrogen atom**: The 1s orbital is split into two basis functions. One is a contraction of 3 primitive Gaussians, and the other is a single primitive Gaussian.\n    *   Total for one Hydrogen atom = 2 contracted functions.\n\nTo calculate the total number of contracted Gaussian functions for toluene (C₇H₈), we sum the functions for all atoms:\n*   Total functions from Carbon: 7 atoms × 9 functions/atom = 63 functions\n*   Total functions from Hydrogen: 8 atoms × 2 functions/atom = 16 functions\n\nThe total number of contracted Gaussian functions is the sum of these two values:\n63 + 16 = 79\n\nThis is confirmed by calculating the basis functions for methanol (CH₃OH) using the same method, which results in 26 basis functions (1 C * 9 + 1 O * 9 + 4 H * 2), matching the figure provided in a search result.\n\n<<<79>>>"
