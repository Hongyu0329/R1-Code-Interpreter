    "The ground state degeneracy of the toric code is determined by the topology of the surface on which it is defined. For a given surface, the degeneracy is equal to 2 raised to the power of the number of logical qubits that can be encoded.\n\nFirst, let's establish the baseline for a simple, closed surface. For the toric code on a torus, which is a surface with genus g=1 (one handle or hole), the ground state degeneracy is 4. This can be expressed as 2^(2g), where g is the genus.\n\nWhen the toric code is placed on a planar surface (which has genus g=0) with holes, the degeneracy is determined by the number and type of these holes. Holes in the toric code act as boundaries. There are two primary types of boundaries: smooth and rough. These are also referred to as closed and open boundaries, respectively. The type of boundary is determined by which set of stabilizer operators (star or plaquette) are truncated at the edge.\n\nThe presence of holes introduces non-trivial loops for string-like operators, which correspond to logical operators. Each independent logical qubit requires a pair of non-commuting logical operators. A hole allows for logical operators to be defined in relation to it.\n\nFor a planar surface with `h` holes, each hole can be associated with a doubling of the ground state degeneracy. This is because each hole introduces a new, independent way to create a topologically non-trivial loop for the excitations of the system.\n\nSpecifically, for each smooth hole, one can define a logical qubit. Similarly, for each rough hole, one can define a logical qubit. The `n` smooth holes and `m` rough holes provide independent topological features. A smooth hole allows for a logical operator associated with 'm' (magnetic) anyons, while a rough hole allows for a logical operator associated with 'e' (electric) anyons.\n\nTherefore, having `n` smooth holes gives rise to `n` logical qubits, and `m` rough holes give rise to `m` additional logical qubits. The total number of logical qubits is the sum of those from the smooth and rough holes, which is `n + m`.\n\nThe ground state degeneracy (GSD) is given by the formula:\n\nGSD = 2^(number of logical qubits)\n\nIn this case, the number of logical qubits is `n + m`. Thus, the ground space degeneracy is `2^(n + m)`.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
