The approximate number of non-Clifford gates required to run a simulation of a universal quantum computer on a 2D surface code with a distance-3 code is in the hundreds to thousands. To implement a universal quantum computer on a 2D surface code with a distance-5 code, assuming a faulty gate error rate of at most 1%, the number is in the range of 10,000 to 100,000.
