    "The minimal number of triangles required for the triangulation of the outer-hull of the great icosahedron corresponds to the number of faces of its convex hull. The convex hull of a great icosahedron is a regular icosahedron.\n\nA regular icosahedron is a Platonic solid, which is a polyhedron composed of 20 identical equilateral triangular faces. Therefore, the surface of the great icosahedron's outer-hull is already triangulated in the most minimal way possible.\n\nThe number of visible triangles from the outside is simply the number of faces on this convex hull. As a regular icosahedron has 20 faces, the minimal number of triangles is 20.\n\n<<<20>>>"
