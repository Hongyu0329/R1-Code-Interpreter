    "The number of double points in the stable reduction of a curve is the number of nodal singularities in its stable special fiber. The process involves finding a suitable model of the curve and then reducing it modulo the prime, in this case, 2. A stable model is one whose special fiber is a reduced curve with only ordinary double points (nodes) as singularities. If we can find a model whose special fiber is smooth, then that model is stable, and the number of double points is zero.\n\nThe given curve is:\n$C: y^2 = 8x + x^2 + 4x^3 + 4x^4 + 8x^5$\n\nWe are looking for the stable reduction over the 2-adic integers, $\\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n\nFirst, we perform a change of variables to find a better model. Let $x = 2x_1$ and $y = 2y_1$. Substituting these into the equation gives:\n$(2y_1)^2 = 8(2x_1) + (2x_1)^2 + 4(2x_1)^3 + 4(2x_1)^4 + 8(2x_1)^5$\n$4y_1^2 = 16x_1 + 4x_1^2 + 32x_1^3 + 64x_1^4 + 256x_1^5$\n\nDividing the entire equation by 4, we obtain a new model, $C_1$:\n$y_1^2 = 4x_1 + x_1^2 + 8x_1^3 + 16x_1^4 + 64x_1^5$\n\nThe reduction of this model modulo 2 is:\n$y_1^2 \\equiv x_1^2 \\pmod{2}$\n$y_1^2 - x_1^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2}$\n$(y_1 - x_1)^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2}$ (in characteristic 2)\n\nThis special fiber is a non-reduced scheme (a \"double line\") and is singular at the origin $(0,0)$. To find the stable reduction, we must resolve this singularity. This is done by a procedure called blowing up. For this type of singularity, we apply the transformation:\n$x_1 = X$\n$y_1 = X + 2Y$\n\nSubstituting this into the equation for $C_1$:\n$(X + 2Y)^2 = 4X + X^2 + 8X^3 + 16X^4 + 64X^5$\n$X^2 + 4XY + 4Y^2 = 4X + X^2 + 8X^3 + 16X^4 + 64X^5$\n\nSubtracting $X^2$ from both sides and simplifying:\n$4XY + 4Y^2 = 4X + 8X^3 + 16X^4 + 64X^5$\n\nDividing by 4 gives a new model, $C_2$:\n$Y^2 + XY = X + 2X^3 + 4X^4 + 16X^5$\n\nThis model has integer coefficients. Let's examine its reduction modulo 2:\n$Y^2 + XY \\equiv X \\pmod{2}$\n$Y^2 + XY - X = 0$ over the field $\\mathbb{F}_2$.\n\nNow, we check if this reduced curve is smooth. A curve is smooth if it has no singular points. A point is singular if the partial derivatives with respect to all variables are simultaneously zero at that point. Let $G(X, Y) = Y^2 + XY - X$.\n$\\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial X} = Y - 1$\n$\\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial Y} = 2Y + X = X$ (in $\\mathbb{F}_2$)\n\nFor a point to be singular, both partial derivatives must be zero. This gives $Y - 1 = 0 \\implies Y = 1$ and $X = 0$. So, the only candidate for a singular point is $(0, 1)$. To be a singular point, it must lie on the curve. Let's check:\n$G(0, 1) = 1^2 + (0)(1) - 0 = 1$\nSince $G(0, 1) \\neq 0$, the point $(0, 1)$ is not on the curve. Therefore, the affine curve has no singular points. A further check at the points at infinity confirms that the projective completion is also smooth.\n\nSince the special fiber of our model $C_2$ is a smooth curve, this is the stable reduction of the original curve. A smooth curve has no singular points, and therefore no double points.\n\n<<<0>>>"
