Yes, the exotic ammonia molecule would exhibit tunneling. The potential energy surface which gives rise to tunneling is determined by electrostatic interactions, not nuclear spin. While the switch from fermionic (spin 1/2) to bosonic (spin 0) hydrogens changes the symmetry requirements for the total wavefunction, it alters which rotational states are coupled to the symmetric and antisymmetric inversion states but does not eliminate the existence of the inversion doublet itself. The energy splitting between these states, which is the signature of tunneling, would still be present.
