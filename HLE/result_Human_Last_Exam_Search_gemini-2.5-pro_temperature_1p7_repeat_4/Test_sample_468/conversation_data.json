    "In 2024, the most specific and commonly used name for the genus \"Perdita (Smith, 1853)\" in their native range is \"fairy bee.\" Another frequently used common name is \"miner bee.\"\n\nWhile the term \"miner bee\" is accurate, as these bees typically nest in the ground, it is a broader term that also encompasses other bee genera like *Andrena*. The name \"fairy bee\" is more specifically associated with the *Perdita* genus, likely due to their very small size and often bright, metallic appearance.\n\nThe exact year that \"fairy bee\" was coined for this genus is not definitively documented in available resources. Similarly, while the general term \"mining bee\" dates back to at least 1893, the specific year it was first applied to the genus *Perdita* is not clear. The extensive work on the genus by P.H. Timberlake, who described over 500 species in publications spanning from 1928 to 1980, does not appear to have formally assigned these common names. Recent publications and online databases increasingly use \"fairy bee,\" suggesting it is the more current and specific common name. For example, a 2023 article in *Pacific Horticulture* refers to *Perdita interrupta* as the \"California poppy fairy bee\".\n\n<<<Fairy bee, date not definitively documented>>>"
