    "In the dwarf cuttlefish (*Sepia bandensis*), the brain regions situated posteriorly adjacent to the palliovisceral lobe are primarily the **posterior chromatophore lobes** and the **fin lobes**.\n\nThe palliovisceral lobe is a key component of the posterior subesophageal mass, a region of the cuttlefish brain that controls various motor functions in the more posterior parts of the body. Detailed neuroanatomical studies and 3D brain atlases of the dwarf cuttlefish have clarified the spatial organization of these structures.\n\nThe posterior subesophageal mass contains a cluster of lobes responsible for different actions. The palliovisceral lobe itself is involved in controlling escape responses and inking, which are mediated by the funnel. Located in close proximity within this posterior region are the posterior chromatophore lobes, which govern the chromatophores (color-changing cells) on the mantle, and the fin lobes, which control the movement of the fins. A posterior view of the dwarf cuttlefish brain atlas visually confirms that the posterior chromatophore lobes and the fin lobes are positioned laterally and slightly behind the more centrally located palliovisceral lobe.\n\nThe entire subesophageal mass, which also includes anterior and middle sections, is responsible for a range of motor control functions. The posterior section, including the palliovisceral, posterior chromatophore, and fin lobes, is encased on its posterior side by cranial cartilage.\n\n<<<In the dwarf cuttlefish, the brain regions that lie adjacent posteriorly to the palliovisceral lobe are the posterior chromatophore lobes and the fin lobes.>>>"
