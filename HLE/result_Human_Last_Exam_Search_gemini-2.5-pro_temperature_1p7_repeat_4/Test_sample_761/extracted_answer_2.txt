No, polynucleotides, including homopolynucleotides, are not structurally polysaccharides. They are fundamentally different types of biopolymers. Polynucleotides are composed of nucleotide monomers (containing a phosphate group, a five-carbon sugar, and a nitrogenous base) linked by phosphodiester bonds. Polysaccharides are composed of monosaccharide monomers linked by glycosidic bonds.
