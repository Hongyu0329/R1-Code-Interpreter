    "### Understanding the Calculation\n\nThe \"rule activation level\" in the context of a fuzzy logic system refers to the result of the implication step, which modifies the consequent fuzzy set based on the firing strength of the antecedent. This is typically calculated by applying a t-norm operation between the antecedent's firing strength and the membership function of the consequent.\n\nIn this specific query, we are given:\n*   The firing strength of the k-th rule's antecedent, `Phi_k(x′) = 0.7`. This value represents the degree to which the \"IF\" part of the rule is true.\n*   The membership grade of the output `y_j` in the `j`-th consequent fuzzy set `G_k_j` of the same rule, `μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9`. This value represents the degree to which `y_j` belongs to the output fuzzy set defined in the \"THEN\" part of the rule.\n\nThe problem, while mentioning \"interval type-3 fuzzy set,\" provides crisp numerical values for the antecedent firing strength and the consequent membership. This suggests a simplified calculation at a specific point, which is a common practice in fuzzy logic system analysis. The \"rule activation level\" for this specific output is the result of applying a t-norm to these two values.\n\n### The Role of the T-Norm\n\nA t-norm is a function that models the logical \"AND\" operation in fuzzy logic. Since the query does not specify which t-norm to use, the result will differ depending on the chosen t-norm. Here are the calculations for the most common t-norms:\n\n*   **Minimum T-Norm:** This is one of the most frequently used t-norms. It takes the minimum of the two values.\n    *   Calculation: `min(0.7, 0.9) = 0.7`\n\n*   **Product T-Norm:** This t-norm multiplies the two values. It tends to produce a \"scaled\" or smaller output compared to the minimum t-norm.\n    *   Calculation: `0.7 * 0.9 = 0.63`\n\n*   **Lukasiewicz T-Norm:** This t-norm is defined by the formula `max(0, a + b - 1)`.\n    *   Calculation: `max(0, 0.7 + 0.9 - 1) = max(0, 0.6) = 0.6`\n\nThese calculations show that the rule activation level depends directly on the specific t-norm employed for the implication process. Each t-norm has different properties and may be chosen based on the desired behavior of the fuzzy system.\n\n<<<The rule activation level is 0.7 when using the minimum t-norm, 0.63 with the product t-norm, and 0.6 with the Lukasiewicz t-norm.>>>"
