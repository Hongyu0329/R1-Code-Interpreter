    "To find the separatrix of the given system of differential equations, we first identify the equilibrium points and analyze their stability.\n\nThe system of differential equations is:\n$$d'(t)=2d^2(t)+(-3u(t)+5u^2(t))d(t)-u(t)(1-u(t))u^2(t)$$\n$$u'(t)=(u(t)-1)u^2(t)$$\n\nLet's denote $d'(t)$ as $d'$ and $u'(t)$ as $u'$. We are interested in the phase plane for $u \\geq 0$.\n\n### 1. Finding Equilibrium Points\n\nEquilibrium points $(d, u)$ are solutions to $d' = 0$ and $u' = 0$.\n\nFirst, we set $u' = 0$:\n$u^2(u-1) = 0$\nThis gives us two possible values for $u$: $u=0$ or $u=1$.\n\nNow, we substitute these values into the equation for $d'$ to find the corresponding values of $d$.\n\n**Case 1: u = 0**\nSubstituting $u=0$ into the equation for $d'$:\n$d' = 2d^2 + (-3(0)+5(0)^2)d - 0^3(1-0) = 0$\n$2d^2 = 0 \\implies d=0$\nSo, one equilibrium point is **(0, 0)**.\n\n**Case 2: u = 1**\nSubstituting $u=1$ into the equation for $d'$:\n$d' = 2d^2 + (-3(1)+5(1)^2)d - 1^3(1-1) = 0$\n$2d^2 + 2d = 0$\n$2d(d+1) = 0 \\implies d=0$ or $d=-1$\nSo, we have two more equilibrium points: **(0, 1)** and **(-1, 1)**.\n\nThe equilibrium points in the upper half-plane ($u \\geq 0$) are (0, 0), (0, 1), and (-1, 1).\n\n### 2. Stability Analysis\n\nTo determine the nature of these equilibrium points, we compute the Jacobian matrix of the system. Let $f(d, u) = d'$ and $g(d, u) = u'$.\n\n$J(d, u) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial d} & \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial u} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial d} & \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial u} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 4d - 3u + 5u^2 & (-3 + 10u)d - 3u^2 + 4u^3 \\\\ 0 & 3u^2 - 2u \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nNow we evaluate the Jacobian at each equilibrium point:\n\n*   **At (0, 0):**\n    $J(0, 0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    The eigenvalues are both 0. This is a non-hyperbolic point, and stability cannot be determined from linearization alone.\n\n*   **At (0, 1):**\n    $J(0, 1) = \\begin{pmatrix} 4(0) - 3(1) + 5(1)^2 & (-3 + 10)(0) - 3(1)^2 + 4(1)^3 \\\\ 0 & 3(1)^2 - 2(1) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    The eigenvalues are the diagonal entries, $\\lambda_1 = 2$ and $\\lambda_2 = 1$. Since both eigenvalues are positive, **(0, 1) is an unstable node**.\n\n*   **At (-1, 1):**\n    $J(-1, 1) = \\begin{pmatrix} 4(-1) - 3(1) + 5(1)^2 & (-3 + 10)(-1) - 3(1)^2 + 4(1)^3 \\\\ 0 & 3(1)^2 - 2(1) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -2 & -6 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1 = -2$ and $\\lambda_2 = 1$. Since one eigenvalue is positive and the other is negative, **(-1, 1) is a saddle point**.\n\n### 3. Identifying the Separatrix\n\nA separatrix is a curve in the phase plane that separates trajectories with different long-term behaviors. Separatrices are typically the stable and unstable manifolds associated with saddle points.\n\nLet's search for an invariant manifold, which is a curve that is a union of trajectories. We can test for a simple relationship between $d$ and $u$, of the form $d=f(u)$. Let's try the form $d = ku^n$. A test reveals a particularly simple solution: let's check if the parabola $d = -u^2$ is a solution curve.\n\nIf $d(t) = -u(t)^2$, then by the chain rule, $d'(t) = -2u(t)u'(t)$.\nSubstituting $u'(t) = u^2(t)(u(t)-1)$:\n$d'(t) = -2u(t) [u^2(t)(u(t)-1)] = -2u^4(t) + 2u^3(t)$.\n\nNow, we substitute $d = -u^2$ into the first differential equation:\n$d'(t) = 2(-u^2)^2 + (-3u+5u^2)(-u^2) - u^3(1-u)$\n$d'(t) = 2u^4 - 3u^3 + 5u^4 - u^3 + u^4$\n$d'(t) = (2+5+1)u^4 + (-3-1)u^3 = 8u^4-4u^3$. There seems to be a typo in the user prompt provided equations, as this does not match. Let's assume the first equation from the prompt is `d'(t)=2d^2(t)+(-3u(t)+5u^2(t))d(t)-u^3(t)(1-u(t))`.\nRecalculating with this equation:\n$d'(t) = 2(-u^2)^2 + (-3u+5u^2)(-u^2) - u^3(1-u)$\n$d'(t) = 2u^4 - (3u^3 - 5u^4) - (u^3 - u^4)$\n$d'(t) = 2u^4 - 3u^3 + 5u^4 - u^3 + u^4 = (2+5+1)u^4 - (3+1)u^3 = 8u^4 - 4u^3$. This still does not match.\n\nThere seems to be a mistake in the reasoning above or the problem statement transcription. Let's reconsider the original equation from the prompt carefully:\n$d'(t)=2d^2(t)+(-3u(t)+5u^2(t))d(t)-u(t)(1-u(t))u^2(t)$ which is $d' = 2d^2 + (5u^2 - 3u)d - u^3(1-u)$.\n\nLet's re-verify the substitution of $d = -u^2$:\nRHS: $2(-u^2)^2 + (5u^2-3u)(-u^2) - u^3+u^4$\n$= 2u^4 - 5u^4 + 3u^3 - u^3 + u^4$\n$= (2-5+1)u^4 + (3-1)u^3 = -2u^4 + 2u^3$.\n\nLHS: $d' = \\frac{d}{dt}(-u^2) = -2u u' = -2u(u^2(u-1)) = -2u(u^3-u^2) = -2u^4 + 2u^3$.\n\nThe LHS and RHS match. Thus, **$d = -u^2$ is an exact solution curve (an invariant manifold)** of the system.\n\nThis curve connects the equilibrium points:\n*   If $u=0$, then $d=-(0)^2=0$. The curve passes through **(0, 0)**.\n*   If $u=1$, then $d=-(1)^2=-1$. The curve passes through **(-1, 1)**.\n\nSo, the parabolic curve $d=-u^2$ is a trajectory that connects the saddle point (-1, 1) to the non-hyperbolic point (0, 0). Such a trajectory is a heteroclinic orbit.\n\nThis curve is the unstable manifold of the saddle point (-1, 1). We can verify this by checking the tangent at (-1, 1). The eigenvector for the unstable eigenvalue $\\lambda=1$ of the Jacobian at (-1,1) is $\\begin{pmatrix} -2 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$. The tangent to the curve $d=-u^2$ is given by the vector $(\\frac{d(d)}{du}, 1) = (-2u, 1)$, which at $u=1$ is $(-2, 1)$. This confirms that the curve $d=-u^2$ is tangent to the unstable direction of the saddle point.\n\nThe unstable manifold of a saddle point is a separatrix. It governs the boundaries of different long-term behaviors in the phase plane. In this system, this special curve is a strong candidate for being \"the\" separatrix of interest.\n\n<<<The separatrix is the parabola given by the equation $d = -u^2$.>>>"
