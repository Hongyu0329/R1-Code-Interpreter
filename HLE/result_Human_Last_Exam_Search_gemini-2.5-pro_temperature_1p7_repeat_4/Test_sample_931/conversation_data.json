    "Adult Raphidopterans, commonly known as snakeflies, have a diet that primarily consists of small, soft-bodied arthropods. They are considered beneficial predators in various ecosystems, including forests and orchards.\n\nA breakdown of their recorded diet includes:\n*   **Aphids:** Adult snakeflies are frequently documented as predators of aphids and other small, weak prey. They have a distinct preference for aphids and are considered important predators of these pests.\n*   **Nectar and Pollen:** While primarily carnivorous, some adult snakeflies are also known to feed on nectar, pollen, or honeydew. Pollen has been found in the digestive tracts of adults, though it is unclear if it's an essential part of their diet. There are also reports of adults taking nectar, although some sources note this is not definitively confirmed for all species.\n*   **Other prey:** Their predatory diet also includes mites and other small insects.\n\nBased on the provided options, snakeflies have been recorded feeding on both nectar and aphids. There is no evidence they consume fungus or leaf tissue. While the specific \"Totara\" aphid or \"Māhoe\" pollen is not explicitly named in general literature, aphids are a primary food source, and nectar/pollen is a known secondary food source.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice reflects the consumption of both nectar and aphids.\n\n<<<F>>>"
