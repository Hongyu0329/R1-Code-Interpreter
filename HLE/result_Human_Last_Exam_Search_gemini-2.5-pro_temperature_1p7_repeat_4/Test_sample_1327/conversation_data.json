    "Let the sequence be denoted by a(n).\na(1) = 2\na(2) = 11\na(3) = 23\na(4) = 51\na(5) = 119\n\nLet's explore possible relationships between consecutive terms.\n\n**Pattern 1: Multiplication and addition/subtraction**\nLet's test the form a(n) = k * a(n-1) + c.\n- 11 = 2 * a(1) + c => 11 = 2 * 2 + c => c = 7\n- 23 = 2 * a(2) + c => 23 = 2 * 11 + c => c = 1\nThis indicates that the added value is not constant.\n\nLet's examine the pattern a(n) = 2 * a(n-1) + k where k changes.\n- a(2) = 2 * a(1) + 7 = 2 * 2 + 7 = 11\n- a(3) = 2 * a(2) + 1 = 2 * 11 + 1 = 23\n- a(4) = 2 * a(3) + 5 = 2 * 23 + 5 = 51\n- a(5) = 2 * a(4) + 17 = 2 * 51 + 17 = 119\nThe sequence of added numbers is 7, 1, 5, 17, which doesn't present an obvious simple pattern.\n\nLet's try a(n) = 3 * a(n-1) - c.\n- a(2) = 3 * a(1) - c => 11 = 3 * 2 - c => c = -5\n- a(3) = 3 * a(2) - c => 23 = 3 * 11 - c => c = 10\nThis also doesn't yield a simple pattern for 'c'.\n\n**Pattern 2: A different kind of relation**\nLet's re-examine the relationship between the terms. Another common pattern is where the next term is derived from the previous one with a multiplication and an alternating or simple sequence of additions/subtractions. Let's revisit `a(n) = 2 * a(n-1) + c`.\n\n- a(2) = 2 * a(1) + 7\n- a(3) = 2 * a(2) + 1\n\nThis doesn't seem to work. Let's check a different relationship.\n\nMaybe the pattern is related to the position of the term in the sequence.\n\n**Pattern 3: Relating to the previous term.**\nThere seems to be another common pattern which can be of the form a(n+1) = a(n) + (some function of n or a(n-1)).\n\nLet's check `a(n) = 2 * a(n-1) +/-` a different constant.\nLet's see: `a(n) = 2*a(n-1) + a(n-2)`?\na(3) = 2*11 + 2 = 24 (not 23)\n\nLet's try a simpler approach by re-examining the multiplication pattern.\na(1) = 2\na(2) = 2*2 + 7 = 11\na(3) = 2*11 + 1 = 23\na(4) = 2*23 + 5 = 51\na(5) = 2*51 + 17 = 119\nThis does not provide a clear path.\n\nHowever, another pattern is possible:\n- `a(2) = a(1) * 2 + 7` (11 = 2 * 2 + 7)\n- `a(3) = a(2) * 2 + 1` (23 = 11 * 2 + 1)\n- `a(4) = a(3) * 2 + 5` (51 = 23 * 2 + 5)\n- `a(5) = a(4) * 2 + 17` (119 = 51 * 2 + 17)\nThe added sequence 7, 1, 5, 17 does not seem regular.\n\nLet's try one more common pattern `y = 2x + k` or `y = 3x - k`\n1. `11 = 2 * 2 + 7`\n2. `23 = 2 * 11 + 1`\n3. `51 = 2 * 23 + 5`\n4. `119 = 2 * 51 + 17`\n\nThis pattern doesn't seem to hold a simple logic.\n\nLet's look for `a(n) = 2*a(n-1)+k`, and the `k` sequence is `7, 1, 5, 17`. No obvious pattern.\n\nLet's look at another pattern:\n2\n11 = 5 * 2 + 1\n23 = 2 * 11 + 1\n51 = 2 * 23 + 5\n119 = 2 * 51 + 17\n\nLet's reconsider the pattern `a(n) = 2*a(n-1) + k`. Maybe there is an error in my analysis. Let's try `a(n) = 2*a(n-1) + (something else)`\nLet's examine `a(n+1) = 2 * a(n) -/+ c` again.\n- 11 = 2 * 2 + 7\n- 23 = 2 * 11 + 1\nThis doesn't seem to work as there is no consistent `c`.\n\nLet's analyze the difference between the given number and the closest power of 2.\n`2, 11, 23, 51, 119`\n`2^1=2`, `2^2=4`, `2^3=8`, `2^4=16`, `2^5=32`, `2^6=64`, `2^7=128`.\n\n`a_1=2`\n`a_2=11 = 2^3+3`\n`a_3=23 = 2^4+7`\n`a_4=51 = 2^5+19` or `2^6-13`\n`a_5=119 = 2^7-9`\n\nLet's try relating each number to the previous one again: `a(n+1) = 2 * a(n) +/- k`\n`11 = 2*2 + 7`\n`23 = 2*11 + 1`\n`51 = 2*23 + 5`\n`119 = 2*51 + 17`\n\nLet's test `a(n) = 2*a(n-1)+3` for all of them\n`2*2+3 = 7` (not 11)\n\nThere must be a different logic. Let's re-examine `a(n) = a(n-1)*k + c` from search result:\nLet's try `a(n) = 3 * a(n-1) + c`.\n`11 = 3 * 2 + 5`\n`23 = 3 * 11 - 10` (no simple pattern for c)\n\nLet's go back to `a(n) = 2*a(n-1) + k`. Let's test again for a different pattern with prime numbers.\n`a(1)=2`\n`a(2)=2*a(1)+7(prime) = 11`\n`a(3)=2*a(2)+1(not prime) = 23`\n`a(4)=2*a(3)+5(prime) = 51`\n`a(5)=2*a(4)+17(prime) = 119`\n\nLet's look for a different pattern that has been found online.\n\nOne possible pattern could be `a(n) = 2*a(n-1) + a(n-2)` with some adjustments, but it doesn't fit.\n\nThe simplest relationship seems to be `y=mx+c`, so let's check one more time `a(n+1) = k*a(n) +/- constant`.\n- `11 = 2*2+7`\n- `23 = 2*11+1`\n- `51 = 2*23+5`\n- `119 = 2*51+17`\n\nThe added numbers are 7, 1, 5, 17. Let's see the differences here:\n1-7 = -6\n5-1 = 4\n17-5 = 12\n\nThis does not suggest an easy pattern. Let's re-evaluate from the beginning.\n\nLet the term be a(n).\n`a(1) = 2`\n`a(2) = 11`\n`a(3) = 23`\n`a(4) = 51`\n`a(5) = 119`\n\nLet's try `a(n+1) = 2*a(n) + (-1)^n * k`.\n`11 = 2*2 + 7`\n`23 = 2*11 + 1`\nIt fails.\n\nAnother possibility: `a(n+1) = a(n) + a(n-1) + k`.\n`23 = 11 + 2 + 10`.\n`51 = 23 + 11 + 17`.\n\nWhat if the formula is `a(n) = 2*a(n-1) + x_n`, where `x_n` is an alternating sequence?\nThis seems overly complicated. A simpler pattern should exist.\n\nA key insight can sometimes be found in how far the numbers are from a round number, or from a known sequence.\n\nLet's try to relate to the term before the previous `a(n) = a(n-1) + 2*a(n-2)`?\n`23 = 11 + 2*2 = 15` (no)\n\nMaybe the sequence `k` in `a(n) = 2*a(n-1) + k` is related to prime numbers, e.g., 7, 1 (as 3-2), 5, 17. Still no.\n\nLet's consider another option, that a different base multiplication is used.\n`a(2) = 4*a(1)+3 = 4*2+3=11`\n`a(3) = 2*a(2)+1 = 2*11+1=23`\n`a(4) = 2*a(3)+5 = 2*23+5 = 51`\n`a(5) = 2*a(4)+17 = 2*51+17=119`\n\nThere must be a consistent rule. Let's step back.\nLet's examine `2, 11, 23, 51, 119`.\nIt's possible there's an error in my reasoning or the question is flawed.\nI'll retry what others have found online.\n\nThere's one pattern: `a(n) = a(n-1) + 2^(n-1) + k` but this is unlikely.\nI will follow this pattern `y=2x+k`:\n`a(2)=2a(1)+7`\n`a(3)=2a(2)+1`\n`a(4)=2a(3)+5`\n`a(5)=2a(4)+17`\n\nThis is not a straightforward arithmetic progression on k.\n\nLet me try a different approach from search result for a similar looking sequence `2,11,38,119`. The pattern was `a(n) = 3*a(n-1)+5`. Let's test that logic on the current sequence:\n`3*2+5 = 11`. (Correct)\n`3*11+5 = 38`. (Incorrect, the term is 23).\n\nSo that logic is not applicable.\n\nLet's try to look for the pattern in `y = 2x - k`.\n- `11 = 2*2 + 7`\n- `23 = 2*11 + 1`\n- `51 = 2*23 + 5`\n- `119 = 2*51 + 17`\nThis is what I derived initially. I must have dismissed the pattern in 7, 1, 5, 17 too quickly. Let's see: 7, 1, 5, 17. No simple arithmetic relation.\n\nLet me look for a different pattern. There might be two interleaved sequences.\nSequence 1: 2, 23, 119\nSequence 2: 11, 51, ()\nPattern for seq 1:\n23 = 11*2+1 - this uses previous term.\n`23 = 10*2+3`\n`119 = 5*23 + 4` no.\n\nPattern for seq 2:\n`51 = 4*11+7`\nIt does not seem to be an interleaved sequence.\n\nGoing back to the pattern `a(n) = 2*a(n-1)+k`, where `k = 7, 1, 5, 17`.\n\nI'll retry my initial calculation of differences.\n`11-2 = 9 = 3^2`\n`23-11 = 12`\n`51-23 = 28`\n`119-51 = 68`\nThe differences are `9, 12, 28, 68`.\nLet's see the differences of these differences.\n`12 - 9 = 3`\n`28 - 12 = 16`\n`68 - 28 = 40`\nStill not simple.\n\nLet's go back to the `y=2x +/- k` form.\nMaybe it is `a(n+1) = 2*a(n) +/- k_n`.\n`11 = 2*2 + 7`\n`23 = 2*11 + 1`\nThis is too irregular.\n\nWhat about `a(n) = 2a(n-1) + 2n - 1`\n`a(2) = 2*2 + 2*2-1 = 7` (No)\n\nLet's rethink `a(n+1) = 2*a(n)+c_n` where c_n might be prime related. `7,1,5,17`. The numbers 7,5,17 are primes. 1 is not.\n\nIt appears the pattern `y = 2x+k` may be the right path, but `k` is the issue. Let's retry that search to confirm if `a(n) = 2a(n-1)+k` has a solution for this series.\n\nAfter exhausting all simple patterns, it is common for such problems to have a 'trick'.\nLooking at the choices: A. 291, B. 285, C. 171, D. 167\n\nLet's assume the next term follows `a(6) = 2 * a(5) + k = 2 * 119 + k = 238 + k`.\nIf `k` follows some pattern.\nIf the pattern is in the additions, `7,1,5,17`, it is not obvious what comes next.\n\nLet's re-try another pattern I saw online for `1, 2, 6, 15, 31, ?`. The difference of differences are squares. Let's apply that here.\nSequence: `2, 11, 23, 51, 119`\nDifferences: `9, 12, 28, 68`\nDifferences of differences: `3, 16, 40`\n`16 = 4^2`, but 3 and 40 are not simple squares.\n\nLet's look at `a(n) = 2*a(n-1)+a(n-2)`.\n`a(3) = 2*11+2 = 24` which is close to 23. Let's see if this `close`ness is a pattern.\n`a(3) = 2*a(2)+a(1) - 1 = 24-1=23`\n`a(4) = 2*a(3)+a(2) - 1 = 2*23+11-1 = 46+10 = 56` (Incorrect, should be 51)\n\nOk, let me assume a pattern of the form `a_n = 2a_{n-1} + c_n`.\n`c_1=7, c_2=1, c_3=5, c_4=17`\nI can't see the pattern. There must be another relationship.\n\nMaybe the relationship is of the form `a_n = a_{n-1} + a_{n-2} + ...`\n`23 = 11+2+10`\n`51 = 23+11+17`\n\nOkay, what if `a(n) = 2*a(n-1) + a(n-2)` is close?\nLet's check `a(n+1) = 2a(n)+a(n-1)`\n`a(3) = 2*11+2=24`\n`a(4) = 2*23+11=57`\n`a(5) = 2*51+23=125`\nThe given sequence is `2, 11, 23, 51, 119`.\nMy calculated sequence `a'(n)`: `2, 11, 24, 57, 125`.\nLet's see the difference `a'(n) - a(n)`.\n`a'(3)-a(3) = 24-23=1`\n`a'(4)-a(4) = 57-51=6`\n`a'(5)-a(5) = 125-119=6`\n\nThis does not reveal a simple pattern.\n\nLet's reconsider the relation `a(n) = 2*a(n-1) + k`. Let's test the given options to see if `k` becomes logical.\n`a(6) = 2*119 + k = 238+k`.\nA) `291 = 238 + 53` -> k=53\nB) `285 = 238 + 47` -> k=47\nC) `171` -> too small.\nD) `167` -> too small.\n\nThe sequence of `k` values would be `7, 1, 5, 17, 47` or `7, 1, 5, 17, 53`.\n47 is a prime number. `7, 1, 5, 17, 47`. What could be the pattern here? `1` is the spoiler.\nWhat if `1` is considered `3-2=1`. Still no simple pattern emerges.\n\nGiven the common nature of these tests, a simpler logic must be at play.\nLet's try one more time from the beginning:\n`2, 11, 23, 51, 119`\nLet's check a different relationship:\n`11 = 5*2+1`\n`23 = 2*11+1`\nThis is inconsistent.\n\nI must be missing something simple. Let's look at the numbers again:\n`2, 11, 23, 51, 119`.\nLet's try `a_n * 2 + a_{n-1}`:\n`11*2+2=24`. (Close to 23).\n`23*2+11=57`. (Close to 51).\n`51*2+23=125`. (Close to 119).\n\nDifferences are: `24-23=1`, `57-51=6`, `125-119=6`. Still doesn't help much.\n\nLet's assume the relation is `a(n+1) = 2 * a(n) + c(n)`\n`c(1)=7, c(2)=1, c(3)=5, c(4)=17`. I cannot find the pattern for `c(n)`.\n\nFinal try:\n`a_1 = 2`\n`a_2 = 11 = a_1*2+7`\n`a_3 = 23 = a_2*2+1`\n`a_4 = 51 = a_3*2+5`\n`a_5 = 119 = a_4*2+17`\n\nThis is where I've been stuck. I'll search for this sequence and its pattern again more carefully. Maybe I missed the explanation. I'll try searching for \"2, 11, 23, 51, 119 pattern\". It seems I have exhausted my own logical derivations, so an external check is the best bet.\nLet's assume the pattern `y = 2x - c` works:\n`a_2 = 2 * a_1 + 7`\n`a_3 = 2 * a_2 + 1`\n... this does not lead to a simple pattern.\n\nThere is a simple pattern:\n2*2 + 7 = 11\n2*11 + 1 = 23\nThis seems flawed. Let me check: `a(n) = 2a(n-1) +/- k`.\n11 = 2*2+7.\n23 = 2*11+1.\nThis suggests no simple arithmetic progression for the constant.\n\nWhat if the relationship is `y = 2x+c` but c is not constant. Let me retry.\n1. `11 = 2 * 2 + 7`\n2. `23 = 2 * 11 + 1`\nThis is where it is going wrong. Maybe the question is transcribed incorrectly? Let's assume the pattern should have been simple.\nLet's try the logic `a(n+1) = 2a(n) + a(n-1) - a(n-2)`\na(4) = 2*a(3) + a(2) - a(1) = 2*23 + 11 - 2 = 46+9 = 55 (close to 51).\n\nLet's check the options again.\nThe numbers are roughly doubling. So the next number is roughly `119 * 2 = 238`. All options A,B,C,D except C and D are in this ballpark.\n285, 291.\n`285 - 238 = 47`. This gives `k=47`. `c_n` becomes `7, 1, 5, 17, 47`.\n`291 - 238 = 53`. This gives `k=53`. `c_n` becomes `7, 1, 5, 17, 53`.\n\nLet's look at `7, 1, 5, 17, 47`. No obvious rule.\nLet's look at `7, 1, 5, 17, 53`. No obvious rule.\n\nLet's look again at the differences: `9, 12, 28, 68`.\nWhat if we have `a_{n+1} = a_n + 3^{n}`\n`a_2 = 2+3^2 = 11`. (ok)\n`a_3 = 11 + 3^3 = 38`. (not 23).\n\nI think I must have missed a simple transformation. Let's look for a very simple logic.\n`a(n+1) = 2a(n) + k`. Let's test again for a constant `k`. `2*2+k=11 => k=7`.\n`2*11+7=29`. (not 23).\n\nWhat about `a(n+1)=3a(n)-k`.\n`3*2-k=11 => k=-5`.\n`3*11-(-5)=38`. (not 23).\n\nIt seems the pattern I was looking at must be flawed.\n\nThere is another possible pattern: multiply by 2 and add an increasing number:\n`2*2+7 = 11`\n`2*11+1=23` ... This is the flaw. It does not increase.\n\nLet me try a different approach. The problem could be simpler.\nLet's double each number and observe: `4, 22, 46, 102, 238`.\nRelation to original seq:\n`11 - 4 = 7`\n`23 - 22 = 1`\n`51 - 46 = 5`\n`119 - 102 = 17`\n`X - 238 = ?`\nThe added/subtracted numbers are `7, 1, 5, 17`. I'm back where I started.\n\nI will make an educated guess. If `a(n+1) = 2*a(n) + k_n`, `k_n = 7, 1, 5, 17`. This sequence is strange.\nLet's reconsider the question's source. It might have a known type of error.\n\nWhat if there is a typo and `a(3)` was 29?\n`2, 11, 29, 51, 119`\n`11 = 2*2+7`\n`29 = 2*11+7`\n`51 != 2*29+7`. So, no.\n\nGiven the options, and `a(6)` being around 238, let's re-examine `238+k`. `k` has been `7,1,5,17`. There is no simple arithmetic progression. What if it is `prime(n+c) related`?\n`7` (4th prime)\n`1`\n`5` (3rd prime)\n`17` (7th prime)\n\nThere is a known sequence which is `a(n) = 2*a(n-1) + a(n-2)`. Let's check `a(6) = 2*a(5)+a(4) = 2*119+51 = 238+51 = 289`.\nThis is very close to 291 and 285.\nMy `a'(n)` sequence was `2, 11, 24, 57, 125, 289`\nOriginal `a(n)` is `2, 11, 23, 51, 119, X`\nDifference `a'(n)-a(n)`: `0, 0, 1, 6, 6`. No simple pattern to predict the next difference.\n\nLet's assume there is a typo in the question and a(3) is 25.\n2, 11, 25, 51, 119\n11 = 2*2+7\n25 = 2*11+3\n51 = 2*25+1\n...No\n\nFinal Attempt based on the initial logic `y=2x+k`:\nThe sequence for k is `7, 1, 5, 17`. There is no obvious logic for what comes next.\n\nBut let's reconsider `a(n) = 2a(n-1)+a(n-2)`. My calculated next term is 289. This is very close to 291. The difference sequence was `1, 6, 6`. Maybe the next difference is `1` again? `289-1 = 288` not an option. Maybe `0`? Then 289.\n\nI believe `a_{n+1} = 2a_n + a_{n-1}` is a strong candidate and small variations might explain the sequence.\nLet's see what `2*119+51=289`.\nThe differences `a(n) - (2a(n-1)+a(n-2))` were: `-1` (for 23), `-6` (for 51), `-6` (for 119). What comes next?\nLet `d(n) = a(n)-(2a(n-1)+a(n-2))`.\n`d(3)=-1`, `d(4)=-6`, `d(5)=-6`. `d(6)` could be `-1` again?\nIf `d(6)=-1` then `X = 2*119+51 - 1 = 289-1 = 288` (not an option).\nIf `d(6)=-6`, `X = 289-6 = 283` (close to 285).\n\nLet's assume there's a simple pattern `y = 2x+c` but the `c` is alternating signs\n`11 = 2*2 + 7`\n`23 = 2*11 + 1` is not `2*11 - something`.\n`23 = 2*11 - (-1)`\n`51 = 2*23 + 5`\n`119 = 2*51 + 17`\nI am returning to this sequence of constants: `7, -1, 5, 17`.\n\nMy best bet is `a_{n+1} = 2a_n+a_{n-1}` based formula gives `289`. 291 is one of the options. What if the correction term is `d(n) = -1, -6, -6, ...`. If the correction pattern is `(-1)^n` then next would be `+1`. `289+1 = 290`, still not 291.\n\nI am confident the pattern is a slight variation of `a_{n+1}=2a_n+a_{n-1}`.\nLet's try to find an online calculator for this sequence to verify my pattern. I will search again.\nThe information I have gathered points to complex or non-obvious patterns. Given the multiple-choice format, a simpler pattern is more probable. Let me retry the search with more precise keywords to get a direct solution. If not, I will have to pick the most logical option. I am confident that more searching will find a solution that a human has already published. Afterall, this is a common type of puzzle.\n\nThe pattern is simpler: `a(n) = 2*a(n-1)+ (prime number)`. Let's test that.\n2*2 + 7 = 11 (7 is prime)\n2*11+1 = 23 (1 is not prime). So no.\n\nBased on one of the search results, another possibility for number sequences is a two-stage series.\nDiffs: 9, 12, 28, 68\n2nd Diffs: 3, 16, 40\nThis does not create an arithmetic series.\n\nGiven the choices, I'll work backwards from `a(6)`.\n`291 = 2 * 119 + 53`. Series of additions: 7,1,5,17,53\n`285 = 2 * 119 + 47`. Series of additions: 7,1,5,17,47\n\nThere is no apparent rule for `7, 1, 5, 17, 53`.\nFor `7, 1, 5, 17, 47`, let's see. Maybe related to `(prime number)^2-2` or something? No.\n\nLet me choose the most logical sequence among `7,1,5,17,47` and `7,1,5,17,53`.\n53 is prime. 47 is prime. 7, 5, 17 are primes. 1 is not. This pattern seems inconsistent.\n\nThere's one more possibility: `y=x*z+k` where `z` is not constant.\n`11=2*5+1`\n`23=11*2+1`\n`51=23*2+5`\n`119=51*2+17`\nThis pattern is almost `a(n)=2a(n-1)+c`, but the first one is an exception. `a(2)=a(1)*5+1`.\nIf we assume the general rule is `a(n)=2a(n-1)+k`, then the sequence of k is `?, 1, 5, 17`. This isn't helping.\n\nLet me trust the `a_{n+1} = 2a_n + a_{n-1}` pattern as being the most mathematical. It gives 289. 291 is just 2 away.\nMaybe `d(n)` is `-1, -6, -6`, perhaps next is `+2`? `289+2=291`. Why `+2`? Because `-1` comes from `(-1)^3`. `-6` from... No.\n\nFinal guess, the solution `a(n+1) = 2a(n)+a(n-1) + 2` is wrong.\nWhat if the pattern is `a(n)=2*a(n-1)+3` for `n` odd and `a(n)=2*a(n-1)-1` for n even?\n`a(2) = 2*2-1=3` (no)\n\nOkay, I am stuck on the pattern `7, 1, 5, 17`.\nI am going with B. 285, because `47` makes a sequence of `7,1,5,17,47`. Although not obvious, this feels slightly more plausible than `..., 53`. It is a weak guess.\n\nWait, I think I have it: `a(n) = 2a(n-1)+a(n-2)` and `a(n) = a(n) - d(n)`. `d(3)=1`, `d(4)=6`, `d(5)=6`. Pattern is `1,6,6`. It could repeat `1,6,6,1,6,6...` so `d(6)=1`. `a(6)=289-1 = 288`. Not in options.\n\nMy initial assumption that there must be a simple pattern is strong. It's likely I have stared at it too long and missed the obvious. Let me clear my head and look again. `2, 11, 23, 51, 119`. Let's assume the options are correct. So the answer is one of them.\nThe next term must be `2*119 + k = 238+k`.\nIf k=47 (for 285) or k=53 (for 291).\n`k` sequence: `7,1,5,17,47` or `7,1,5,17,53`.\nThere is no obvious reason for either of them.\n\nLet me try a completely different pattern I have seen before:\n`2`\n`11`\n`23 = 11*2+1`\n`51 = 23*2+5`\n`119 = 51*2+17`\nThis part seems solid. Let's find the next k. `1,5,17`.\n`5 = 4*1+1`.\n`17 = 3*5+2`. no. `17 = 4*5-3`. no\nLet's look at `1,5,17`. Differences `4,12`. Next diff `12/4*12 = 36`. So `17+36=53`.\nIf next k is 53, `2*119+53 = 238+53=291`.\nLet's re-verify the differences of k: `k2-k1 = 4`, `k3-k2 = 12`. It is possible `k4-k3=12*3=36`. This assumes geometric progression in differences.\nSo the added numbers would be `1, 5, 17, 17+36 = 53`.\nThen `a(6) = 2*a(5)+53 = 2*119+53 = 238+53=291`.\nThis gives answer A. This looks like a plausible complex pattern.\n\nLet's double-check the logic.\n`a(3)=2*a(2)+1`\n`a(4)=2*a(3)+5` where `5=1+4`\n`a(5)=2*a(4)+17` where `17=5+12`\n`a(6)=2*a(5)+53` where `53=17+36`.\nThe sequence of additions to `k` are `4, 12, 36` which is `4, 4*3, 12*3`. This is a consistent geometric progression.\nThis seems a very solid candidate.\n\n<<<A>>>"
