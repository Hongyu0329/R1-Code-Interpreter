    "The exact value of the angle $\\alpha$ for the A($\\alpha$) stability of the BDF4 numerical scheme is given by:\n$\\alpha = \\arctan\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{8525 + 155\\sqrt{2033}}{-51844971 + 5765167\\sqrt{2033}/10}} \\right)$\nThis value is derived from the work of Akrivis and Katsoprinakis, and a simplified derivation is presented by Gander and Wanner. The angle $\\alpha$ defines the largest sector of the form $S_\\alpha = \\{z \\in \\mathbb{C} : |\\arg(-z)| < \\alpha, z \\neq 0\\}$ that is contained within the stability region of the method.\n\nFor the BDF4 method, the stability angle is approximately 73.35 degrees. The exact value of $\\tan^2(\\alpha)$ has been found to be:\n$\\tan^2(\\alpha) = \\frac{8525 + 155\\sqrt{2033}}{-51844971/14086400 + 5765167/70432000 \\sqrt{2033}}$\nwhich can be simplified for the expression of $\\alpha$.\n\nThus, the exact value of the angle $\\alpha$ in radians is:\n<<<arctan(sqrt((8525 + 155*sqrt(2033)) / ((-51844971/14086400) + (5765167/70432000)*sqrt(2033))))>>>"
