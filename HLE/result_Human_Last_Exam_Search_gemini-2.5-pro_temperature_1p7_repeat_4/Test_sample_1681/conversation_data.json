    "In the quantum version of the Prisoner's Dilemma, the introduction of entanglement in the initial state of the players' qubits allows for new strategic possibilities beyond classical cooperation and defection. By leveraging a maximally entangled initial state, the classical dilemma can be resolved.\n\nIn this quantum framework, players can employ a \"quantum\" strategy, often denoted as `Q`. When both players choose this quantum strategy, it leads to a new Nash Equilibrium that is not present in the classical version of the game. A Nash Equilibrium is a state where neither player can improve their outcome by unilaterally changing their strategy.\n\nCrucially, this new quantum equilibrium is also Pareto optimal, meaning it is an outcome where no player's payoff can be improved without diminishing the other's payoff. This resolves the central conflict of the classical Prisoner's Dilemma, where the Nash Equilibrium is not Pareto optimal.\n\nFor the given payoff matrix:\n[[(5,5) , (0,7)],\n [(7,0) , (1,1)]]\n\nWith an optimally designed, maximally entangled initial state, and with both players choosing the optimal quantum strategy `Q`, the resulting equilibrium payoff corresponds to the outcome of mutual cooperation. Therefore, the equilibrium point yields a payoff of (5,5).\n\n<<< (5,5) >>>"
