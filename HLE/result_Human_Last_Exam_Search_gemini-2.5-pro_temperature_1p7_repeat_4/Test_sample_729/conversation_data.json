    "A power subgroup of a group is a cyclic subgroup, which is a subgroup generated by a single element. To determine the number of power subgroups in the generalized quaternion group of order 128, denoted as Q_128, we can use a known formula for the number of cyclic subgroups in a generalized quaternion group.\n\nThe generalized quaternion group of order 2<sup>n</sup>, where n â‰¥ 3, is denoted as Q<sub>2<sup>n</sup></sub>. For the group of size 128, we have 128 = 2<sup>7</sup>, so n = 7.\n\nA formula exists for calculating the number of cyclic subgroups in Q<sub>2<sup>n</sup></sub>, which is given by: 2<sup>n-2</sup> + n.\n\nApplying this formula for the generalized quaternion group of order 128 (n=7):\n\nNumber of cyclic subgroups = 2<sup>(7-2)</sup> + 7\n= 2<sup>5</sup> + 7\n= 32 + 7\n= 39\n\nThe structure of the generalized quaternion group Q<sub>128</sub> consists of a cyclic subgroup of order 64, which contains 7 cyclic subgroups (including the trivial subgroup). The remaining 64 elements of the group all have an order of 4 and form 32 distinct cyclic subgroups of order 4. Summing these up gives 7 + 32 = 39.\n\nThus, there are 39 power subgroups in the generalized quaternion group of size 128.\n\n<<<39>>>"
