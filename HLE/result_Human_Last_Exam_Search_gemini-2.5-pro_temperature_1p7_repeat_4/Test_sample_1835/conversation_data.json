    "<<<Yes, according to Gareth Evans's Generality Constraint, if you understand the proposition *Fa*, you should be able to understand *Fx (∀x)*, provided you understand universal quantification.\n\nHere's the reasoning based on the principles of the constraint:\n\n1.  **Core of the Generality Constraint**: The Generality Constraint states that thoughts are structured and that anyone who can think a certain thought must have the conceptual resources to entertain other, related thoughts. As Evans puts it, \"if a subject can be credited with the thought that *a is F*, then he must have the conceptual resources for entertaining the thought that *a is G*, for every property of being G of which he has a conception\". This principle is about the ability to recombine concepts. If you can think \"John is happy,\" you can also think \"John is sad\" (if you have the concept of sadness) and \"Harry is happy\" (if you have a concept of Harry).\n\n2.  **Separating Concepts**: To understand the proposition *Fa* (e.g., \"Socrates is mortal\"), you must possess the individual concept of *a* (Socrates) and the concept of the predicate *F* (being mortal). The Generality Constraint implies that these concepts are distinct and can be deployed in different cognitive contexts.\n\n3.  **Recombining with a Quantifier**: The proposition *Fx (∀x)* (\"Everything is mortal\") uses the same predicate concept, *F*, but combines it with a different logical apparatus—the universal quantifier (∀x).\n\n4.  **Putting it Together**: Your question includes the crucial assumption that you already understand universal quantification. Therefore, you possess:\n    *   The concept of the predicate *F* (from understanding *Fa*).\n    *   The concept of universal quantification (by assumption).\n\nThe Generality Constraint is fundamentally about the productive capacity of thought through the recombination of existing conceptual abilities. Since you have the necessary conceptual components (the predicate and the quantifier), the constraint dictates that you should be able to combine them to form the new, universally quantified thought. To lack this ability would imply that your concept of *F* is restricted in a way that violates the principle of general recombinability that lies at the heart of Evans's constraint."
