    "The number of non-Grassman variables required to parametrize the bosonic sector of the supersymmetric sigma-model for disordered systems of symmetry class D with two replicas is determined by the dimensionality of the bosonic part of the corresponding target space manifold.\n\nFor symmetry class D with *n* replicas, the target manifold of the supersymmetric sigma-model is the symmetric superspace (coset) G/K. In this specific case, for n=2 replicas, the supergroup G is SpO(4, ℝ|4) and the subgroup K is U(2|2). The non-Grassman variables correspond to the coordinates of the bosonic submanifold G₀/K₀, where G₀ and K₀ are the bosonic parts of the respective supergroups.\n\nThe bosonic subgroup G₀ of SpO(4, ℝ|4) is SO(4) × Sp(4, ℝ). The dimension of a Lie group is the dimension of its corresponding Lie algebra.\nThe dimension of the special orthogonal group SO(p) is given by p(p-1)/2.\n*   dim(SO(4)) = 4 * (4 - 1) / 2 = 6\n\nThe dimension of the real symplectic group Sp(2n, ℝ) is n(2n+1).\n*   dim(Sp(4, ℝ)) = 2 * (2 * 2 + 1) = 10\n\nThus, the total dimension of the bosonic subgroup G₀ is dim(SO(4)) + dim(Sp(4, ℝ)) = 6 + 10 = 16.\n\nThe bosonic subgroup K₀ of U(2|2) is U(2) × U(2). The dimension of the unitary group U(n) is n².\n*   dim(U(2)) = 2² = 4\n\nTherefore, the total dimension of the bosonic subgroup K₀ is dim(U(2)) + dim(U(2)) = 4 + 4 = 8.\n\nThe number of non-Grassman variables needed to parametrize the bosonic sector is the dimension of the coset space G₀/K₀, which is the difference between the dimensions of the respective Lie algebras:\nNumber of variables = dim(G₀) - dim(K₀) = 16 - 8 = 8.\n\n<<<8>>>"
