    "An FGH-tripled fixed point is a concept in mathematics, specifically in fixed-point theory, that generalizes the notion of a standard fixed point and a tripled fixed point. Given three mappings F: X × Y × Z → X, G: Y × X × Z → Y, and H: Z × Y × X → Z, a point (x, y, z) ∈ X × Y × Z is called an FGH-tripled fixed point if it satisfies the following system of equations:\n\n*   F(x, y, z) = x\n*   G(y, x, z) = y\n*   H(z, y, x) = z\n\nThe existence and uniqueness of such a point depend on several conditions imposed on the mappings F, G, and H, and on the metric spaces (X, dₓ), (Y, dᵧ), and (Z, d₂). These conditions typically involve contractive inequalities and properties related to a partial ordering on the spaces.\n\n### Conditions for the Existence of an FGH-Tripled Fixed Point\n\nThe primary conditions for the existence of an FGH-tripled fixed point are established in the context of partially ordered complete metric spaces. These conditions are extensions of the Banach Fixed Point Theorem to a multi-dimensional setting. The key requirements are as follows:\n\n1.  **Complete Metric Spaces**: The spaces (X, dₓ), (Y, dᵧ), and (Z, d₂) must be complete metric spaces. This ensures that every Cauchy sequence in these spaces converges to a point within the space, a crucial element for the convergence of iterative sequences used in the proofs.\n\n2.  **Mixed Monotone Property**: The mappings F, G, and H must satisfy a \"mixed monotone property\". This property relates the ordering of the elements to the ordering of their images under the mappings. For F: X × Y × Z → X, G: Y × X × Z → Y, and H: Z × Y × X → Z, this property is defined as follows: for any x₁, x₂ ∈ X, y₁, y₂ ∈ Y, and z₁, z₂ ∈ Z,\n    *   If x₁ ≤ x₂, y₁ ≥ y₂, z₁ ≤ z₂, then F(x₁, y₁, z₁) ≤ F(x₂, y₂, z₂).\n    *   If y₁ ≤ y₂, x₁ ≥ x₂, z₁ ≥ z₂, then G(y₁, x₁, z₁) ≤ G(y₂, x₂, z₂).\n    *   If z₁ ≤ z₂, y₁ ≥ y₂, x₁ ≤ x₁, then H(z₁, y₁, x₁) ≤ H(z₂, y₂, x₂).\n\n3.  **Contractive Condition**: The functions must satisfy a contraction-type condition. This condition ensures that the distances between the images of points are smaller than the distances between the original points, scaled by a certain factor. A common contractive condition is:\n    *   dₓ(F(x₁, y₁, z₁), F(x₂, y₂, z₂)) + dᵧ(G(y₁, x₁, z₁), G(y₂, x₂, z₂)) + d₂(H(z₁, y₁, x₁), H(z₂, y₂, x₂)) ≤ k(dₓ(x₁, x₂) + dᵧ(y₁, y₂) + d₂(z₁, z₂))\n    for all x₁ ≥ x₂, y₁ ≤ y₂, and z₁ ≥ z₂. The constant 'k' must be in the range [0, 1). This is a generalization of the classic Banach contraction principle.\n\n4.  **Existence of an Initial Point**: There must exist an initial point (x₀, y₀, z₀) ∈ X × Y × Z that satisfies:\n    *   x₀ ≤ F(x₀, y₀, z₀)\n    *   y₀ ≥ G(y₀, x₀, z₀)\n    *   z₀ ≤ H(z₀, y₀, x₀)\n    This initial point is often referred to as a \"lower\" or \"upper\" solution and is necessary to start the iterative process that will converge to the fixed point.\n\n5.  **Continuity or a Weaker Condition**: In some theorems, the continuity of the mappings F, G, and H is required to ensure that the limit of a sequence of iterates is indeed the fixed point. However, this condition can be relaxed. For instance, if the space has the property that for any two non-decreasing sequences {xₙ} → x and {zₙ} → z and a non-increasing sequence {yₙ} → y, we have xₙ ≤ x, yₙ ≥ y, and zₙ ≤ z for all n, then the continuity of the functions is not necessary.\n\nThese conditions collectively guarantee the existence and often the uniqueness of an FGH-tripled fixed point. The concept is a generalization of coupled and tripled fixed points and has applications in solving systems of integral and differential equations.\n\nIn summary, the existence of an FGH-tripled fixed point is guaranteed under a combination of algebraic (mixed monotone property), metric (contractive condition), and topological (completeness of the spaces and existence of an initial point) conditions.\n\n<<<An FGH-tripled fixed point for the functions F:X*Y*Z→X, G:Y*X*Z→Y and H:Z*Y*X→Z exists if the following conditions are met.
