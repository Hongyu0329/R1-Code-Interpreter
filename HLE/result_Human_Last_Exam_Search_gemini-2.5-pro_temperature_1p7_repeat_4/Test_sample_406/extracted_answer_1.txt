An FGH-tripled fixed point for the functions F:X*Y*Z→X, G:Y*X*Z→Y and H:Z*Y*X→Z exists if the following conditions are met. First, (X, dₓ, ≤), (Y, dᵧ, ≤) and (Z, d₂, ≤) must be partially ordered complete metric spaces. Second, the mappings F, G, and H need to satisfy a mixed monotone property, meaning that for any x₁, x₂ ∈ X, y₁, y₂ ∈ Y, and z₁, z₂ ∈ Z, if x₁ ≤ x₂, y₁ ≥ y₂, and z₁ ≤ z₂, then F(x₁, y₁, z₁) ≤ F(x₂, y₂, z₂), G(y₂, x₁, z₁) ≥ G(y₁, x₂, z₂), and H(z₁, y₂, x₁) ≤ H(z₂, y₁, x₂). Third, there must be a contractive condition on the mappings, for example, dₓ(F(x₁, y₁, z₁), F(x₂, y₂, z₂)) + dᵧ(G(y₁, x₁, z₁), G(y₂, x₂, z₂)) + d₂(H(z₁, y₁, x₁), H(z₂, y₂, x₂)) ≤ k(dₓ(x₁, x₂) + dᵧ(y₁, y₂) + d₂(z₁, z₂)) for all x₁ ≥ x₂, y₁ ≤ y₂, z₁ ≥ z₂ where k is a constant in [0, 1). Fourth, there needs to exist an initial point (x₀, y₀, z₀) ∈ X × Y × Z such that x₀ ≤ F(x₀, y₀, z₀), y₀ ≥ G(y₀, x₀, z₀), and z₀ ≤ H(z₀, y₀, x₀). Finally, the mappings F, G, and H are required to be continuous, or the spaces must satisfy a specific sequential property that allows for the convergence to a fixed point without assuming continuity.
