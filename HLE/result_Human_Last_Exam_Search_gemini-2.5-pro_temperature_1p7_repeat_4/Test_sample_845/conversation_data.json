    "The value computed between heartbeats when tracking Heart Rate Variability (HRV) is called the **interbeat interval (IBI)**.\n\nHeart rate variability is the measurement of the fluctuation in time between consecutive heartbeats. This variation is a normal occurrence and provides insights into the state of the autonomic nervous system.\n\nWhen HRV is measured using photoplethysmography (PPG), the time between each pulse wave is recorded. This duration between successive heartbeats is known as the interbeat interval, or IBI, and is typically measured in milliseconds.\n\nWhile sometimes referred to as the R-R interval, this term is more precisely used when measuring HRV with an electrocardiogram (ECG), which tracks the electrical signals of the heart and measures the time between the \"R\" peaks of the QRS complex. For PPG-based measurements, the term \"PP interval\" is also used, referring to the interval between pulse waves. However, \"interbeat interval\" (IBI) is a widely accepted and accurate term for this value regardless of the measurement method.\n\nThis fundamental IBI data is then used to calculate various HRV metrics, such as RMSSD (Root Mean Square of Successive Differences) and SDNN (Standard Deviation of Normal-to-Normal intervals), which quantify the variability.\n\n<<<interbeat interval (IBI)>>>"
