The interaction between the alpha-1 and beta-1 subunits of the human voltage-gated calcium channel 2.3 is primarily mediated by the Guanylate Kinase (GK) domain on the beta-1 subunit binding to the Alpha Interaction Domain (AID) on the alpha-1 subunit. Specific hotspot residues for interaction within the human beta-1 subunit's GK domain are located within the hydrophobic Alpha-Binding Pocket (ABP). While direct numbering can be elusive in the literature for the human beta-1 subunit specifically, studies on homologous beta subunits suggest that key hydrophobic residues, such as leucines and a methionine, are critical. For gating modulation, the GK domain of the beta-1 subunit, particularly the beta-1b isoform, allosterically regulates the inactivation kinetics of the alpha-1 subunit. The precise residues responsible for this fine-tuning are not discretely defined and likely involve a concerted action of multiple residues within the GK domain that influence the conformational state of the channel upon binding.
