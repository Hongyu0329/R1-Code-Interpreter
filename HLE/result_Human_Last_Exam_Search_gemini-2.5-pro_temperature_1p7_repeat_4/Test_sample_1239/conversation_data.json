    "The Lie group of symmetries of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ contains infinite-dimensional components. However, the physically relevant and most commonly discussed part is the maximal finite-dimensional Lie group of symmetries. The dimension of this group is determined by the number of independent generators of the corresponding Lie algebra. These generators correspond to the following transformations that leave the equations invariant:\n\n*   **Time translation:** The equations are autonomous, so they are invariant under a shift in time, $t \\to t + a$. This gives **1 dimension**.\n*   **Space translations:** The equations are invariant under a translation in space, $\\mathbf{x} \\to \\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{a}$. Since the space is $\\mathbb{R}^3$, this contributes **3 dimensions**.\n*   **Spatial rotations:** The equations are covariant under rotations in space, $\\mathbf{x} \\to R\\mathbf{x}$, where $R$ is a rotation matrix. The group of rotations in three dimensions, SO(3), has **3 dimensions**.\n*   **Galilean boosts:** The equations are invariant under a change to a uniformly moving reference frame, $\\mathbf{x} \\to \\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{v}t$, $\\mathbf{u} \\to \\mathbf{u} + \\mathbf{v}$. In three dimensions, this adds **3 dimensions**.\n*   **Scaling transformations:** The Navier-Stokes equations for an incompressible fluid admit a one-parameter group of scaling transformations. This corresponds to a single generator in the Lie algebra. This adds **1 dimension**.\n\nThe total dimension of the maximal finite-dimensional Lie group of symmetries is the sum of the dimensions of these individual transformations.\n\nIn addition to this finite-dimensional group, the full symmetry group of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations is infinite-dimensional. This is due to the pressure term, which allows for a transformation of the form $p \\to p + \\phi(t)$, where $\\phi(t)$ is an arbitrary function of time. There are other sources of infinite dimensionality as well, depending on the specific formulation of the problem. However, the standard dimension of the Lie group of symmetries usually refers to its maximal finite-dimensional subgroup.\n\nSumming the dimensions of the finite-dimensional symmetries: 1 (time) + 3 (space) + 3 (rotations) + 3 (Galilean boosts) + 1 (scaling) = 11.\n\n<<<11>>>"
