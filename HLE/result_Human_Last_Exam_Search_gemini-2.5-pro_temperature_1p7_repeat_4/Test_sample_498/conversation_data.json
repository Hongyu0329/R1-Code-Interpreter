    "The pattern is derived from the bottom row of a standard QWERTY keyboard, with an additional interleaved alphabetical sequence.\n\nHere is the breakdown of the pattern:\n\n1.  The primary sequence consists of the letters from the bottom row of a QWERTY keyboard, read from left to right: Z, X, C, V, B, N, M.\n2.  After every two letters from this keyboard sequence, a new letter is inserted.\n3.  This inserted sequence of letters is alphabetical, starting with X.\n\nLet's trace the sequence:\n*   Start with the first two letters from the keyboard row: `Z`, `X`.\n*   Insert the first letter of the alphabetical sequence: `X`. The sequence is now `ZXX`.\n*   Take the next two letters from the keyboard row: `C`, `V`. The sequence is now `ZXXCV`.\n*   Insert the next letter of the alphabetical sequence (`Y`): `Y`. The sequence is now `ZXXCVY`.\n*   Take the next two letters from the keyboard row: `B`, `N`. The sequence is now `ZXXCVYBN`.\n*   To find the next letter, we need to insert the next letter of the alphabetical sequence (`X`, `Y`, ...), which is `Z`.\n\nTherefore, the next letter in the sequence is Z.\n\n<<<Z>>>"
