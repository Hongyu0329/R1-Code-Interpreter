    "**Kirill was the archimandrite of the Pskov-Caves Monastery from 1730 to 1731.**\n\nAccording to a list of the monastery's leaders, Kirill, whose name in Russian is Кирилл, held the position of archimandrite during this period. His tenure was followed by that of Ignatius, who led the monastery from 1731 to 1732.\n\nThe Pskov-Caves Monastery, a significant spiritual center in Russia, has a long and storied history of leadership. While comprehensive lists of its abbots and archimandrites can be challenging to find, a Russian-language source provides a chronological record of the monastery's heads, identifying Kirill as the leader for the specified years.\n\n<<<H>>>"
