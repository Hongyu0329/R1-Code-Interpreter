    "On a general Riemannian manifold of real dimension `m`, the Riemann curvature tensor `R_ijkl` possesses specific symmetries which reduce its number of independent components to `m^2(m^2 - 1) / 12`.\n\nA Kähler manifold is a special type of Riemannian manifold that also has a complex structure, denoted by `J`, which is compatible with the Riemannian metric `g`. This complex structure introduces further symmetries to the Riemann tensor. These additional symmetries are:\n\n*   `R(JX, JY, Z, W) = R(X, Y, Z, W)`\n*   `R(X, Y, JZ, JW) = R(X, Y, Z, W)`\n\nfor any tangent vectors `X, Y, Z, W`. Consequently, the only potentially non-zero components of the curvature tensor, when expressed in a complex coordinate system, are of the type `R_{i anti(j) k anti(l)}`.\n\nThese extra constraints significantly reduce the number of independent components compared to a general Riemannian manifold of the same real dimension. For a Kähler manifold of complex dimension `n` (and therefore real dimension `m = 2n`), the number of independent entries in the Riemann tensor is given by the square of the dimension of the space of symmetric 2-tensors on the complex tangent space.\n\nThe complex dimension of the space of symmetric 2-tensors `Sym^2(V)` over a complex vector space `V` of dimension `n` is `n(n + 1) / 2`. A Hermitian form on this space is specified by `(n(n+1)/2)^2` real numbers. Thus, the number of independent components of the Riemann tensor on a Kähler manifold of complex dimension `n` is `(n(n + 1) / 2)^2`.\n\nFor example, a 2-dimensional complex manifold (a surface, with `n=1`) is always a Kähler manifold, and the formula yields `(1(1+1)/2)^2 = 1` independent component, which matches the known result for any 2-dimensional real manifold. For a complex 2-dimensional Kähler manifold (`n=2`, real dimension 4), the number of independent components is `(2(2+1)/2)^2 = 9`, which is less than the 20 components for a general 4-dimensional Riemannian manifold.\n\n<<<The number of independent entries in the Riemann tensor on a Kähler manifold of complex dimension `n` is `(n(n+1)/2)^2`.>>>"
