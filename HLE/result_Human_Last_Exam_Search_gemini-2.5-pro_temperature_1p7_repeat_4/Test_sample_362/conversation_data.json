    "The Wittig reaction is a chemical process that converts aldehydes and ketones into alkenes using a phosphonium ylide, also known as a Wittig reagent.\n\nThe reactants in this specific inquiry are:\n*   **Pivalaldehyde**: An aldehyde with the systematic name 2,2-dimethylpropanal. It has a bulky tertiary-butyl group attached to the carbonyl group.\n*   **(2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ⁵-phosphane**: This is the Wittig reagent. The \"triphenyl-λ⁵-phosphane\" part refers to triphenylphosphine (P(C₆H₅)₃) bonded to a carbon group, and \"(2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)\" describes this carbon group. It consists of a two-carbon ethylidene chain (=CH-CH₂) where a 2-chlorophenyl group is attached to the second carbon.\n\nIn the Wittig reaction, the oxygen atom of the aldehyde (pivalaldehyde) and the triphenylphosphine group of the ylide are replaced by a new carbon-carbon double bond. This connects the carbonyl carbon of the pivalaldehyde to the ylidic carbon of the Wittig reagent.\n\nThe resulting product from the reaction is **1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene**. The side product of this reaction is triphenylphosphine oxide.\n\nRegarding the stereochemistry of the double bond, the Wittig reagent in this case, (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ⁵-phosphane, is considered an \"unstabilized\" ylide because there are no electron-withdrawing groups directly attached to the ylidic carbon. Reactions of unstabilized ylides with aldehydes typically yield the (Z)-alkene as the major product. Therefore, the primary product expected is (Z)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene.\n\n<<<1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene>>>"
