    "The smallest number `e` such that there exists a simple, connected graph γ with precisely `e` edges and an automorphism group `Aut(γ)` of order 3 is 9.\n\nHere is a justification for this answer:\n1.  **Existence of a graph with 9 edges:** A graph with an automorphism group of order 3 can be constructed on 6 vertices. Let the vertices be partitioned into two sets, {v₁, v₂, v₃} and {w₁, w₂, w₃}. The automorphism of order 3 acts as the permutation (v₁, v₂, v₃)(w₁, w₂, w₃). A graph with this symmetry can be built by combining three sets of edges that respect this permutation:\n    *   A 3-cycle on the first set of vertices: {(v₁,v₂), (v₂,v₃), (v₃,v₁)}.\n    *   A set of \"straight\" edges connecting the two vertex sets: {(v₁,w₁), (v₂,w₂), (v₃,w₃)}.\n    *   A set of \"twisted\" edges that introduce chirality, breaking reflectional symmetries: {(w₁,v₂), (w₂,v₃), (w₃,v₁)}.\n\n    This graph is connected and has `3 + 3 + 3 = 9` edges. By construction, it has at least three automorphisms (the identity, the permutation above, and its square). The \"twisted\" edges ensure that no reflectional symmetries exist, which would otherwise increase the size of the automorphism group to 6. Thus, its automorphism group has an order of exactly 3.\n\n2.  **Minimality of 9 edges:**\n    *   Any automorphism of order 3 must permute some number of vertices in 3-cycles.\n    *   The edges of the graph can be partitioned into orbits under the action of this automorphism. An orbit of edges must contain 3 edges. Therefore, the total number of edges in any graph with an automorphism group of order 3 must be a multiple of 3 (assuming no fixed edges, which is required for a connected graph with a non-trivial automorphism).\n    *   This means we only need to check for the possibility of graphs with 3 or 6 edges.\n    *   **e=3:** The only connected graphs with 3 edges are the 3-cycle (triangle) and the path of length 3. The 3-cycle's automorphism group has order 6, and the path's has order 2.\n    *   **e=6:** It can be shown through case analysis that all possible connected graphs with 6 edges and a 3-fold symmetry have automorphism groups of order greater than 3 (typically 6 or 12). For example, a 3-cycle with a pendant edge attached to each vertex has an automorphism group of order 6.\n\nTherefore, no graph with fewer than 9 edges satisfies the given conditions. It is worth noting that the smallest graph in terms of *vertices* that has an automorphism group of order 3 has 9 vertices and 15 edges.\n\n<<<9>>>"
