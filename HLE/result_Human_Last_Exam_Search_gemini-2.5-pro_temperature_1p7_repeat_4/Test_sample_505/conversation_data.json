    "In the theory of topological quantum error correction, specifically the surface code, the number of logical qubits that can be encoded on a surface is determined by its topological properties. The key is that separate, disconnected patches of code function independently.\n\nFor a single patch of surface code, the number of logical qubits it can store is related to the number of \"holes\" or defects introduced into it. A simple planar code with no holes can act as a quantum memory for a single logical qubit. However, creating holes provides a robust way to encode and manipulate multiple logical qubits within that same patch.\n\nEach pair of holes created on the surface can encode one logical qubit. Therefore, a single patch with two holes can encode one logical qubit. However, it's also common in the literature for a single hole to be associated with one logical qubit, where logical operators are formed by paths connecting these holes. Adopting the convention that `k` holes can encode `k` logical qubits:\n\n*   **Patch 1:** With two holes, it can encode two logical qubits.\n*   **Patch 2:** With two holes, it can also encode two logical qubits.\n\nSince the two patches are distinct, the total number of logical qubits is the sum of the qubits from each patch.\n\nTherefore, two separate patches of surface code, each with two holes, can encode a total of 4 logical qubits.\n\n<<<4>>>"
