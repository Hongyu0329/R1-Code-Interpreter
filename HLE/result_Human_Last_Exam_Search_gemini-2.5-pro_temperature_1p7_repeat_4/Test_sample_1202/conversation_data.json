    "After a gene duplication event in a eukaryotic genome, the two resulting gene copies are initially redundant. Over evolutionary time, several things can happen to these duplicates. The mechanism most likely responsible for both the retention and subsequent divergence of these duplicated genes from the given choices is subfunctionalization.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the provided options:\n\n*   <b>A. Gene conversion:</b> This is a process where one DNA sequence replaces a homologous sequence, causing them to become more similar. While gene conversion can introduce some changes and has a role in the evolution of gene families, its primary effect is homogenization, which counteracts divergence. Therefore, it is not the main mechanism for both retention and divergence.\n\n*   <b>B. Pseudogenization:</b> This is the process by which one of the gene copies accumulates mutations that render it non-functional. As this leads to the loss of the duplicated gene's function, it is a mechanism of gene loss, not retention. In fact, it's considered the most common fate for duplicate genes.\n\n*   <b>C. Neofunctionalization:</b> In this scenario, one of the gene copies retains the original function, while the other copy accumulates mutations and acquires a completely new function. This is a significant mechanism for the evolution of new gene functions and leads to the retention of both gene copies. However, it relies on the occurrence of rare beneficial mutations.\n\n*   <b>D. Subfunctionalization:</b> This process involves the partitioning of the ancestral gene's functions between the two duplicate copies. Each copy accumulates mutations that degrade different sub-functions of the original gene. As a result, both copies become necessary to carry out the complete set of functions of the ancestral gene, leading to their retention. This model, also known as the Duplication-Degeneration-Complementation (DDC) model, is considered a highly plausible and common mechanism for the preservation of duplicate genes because it can occur through the accumulation of more common, neutral or slightly deleterious mutations, rather than relying on rare, advantageous mutations as neofunctionalization does.\n\n*   <b>E. Adaptive radiation:</b> This is a macroevolutionary concept describing the rapid diversification of a single lineage into multiple species that occupy different ecological niches. It is a process that occurs at the species level, not a molecular mechanism that acts on individual duplicated genes.\n\nWhile both neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization are crucial for the retention and divergence of duplicated genes, subfunctionalization is often considered a more likely initial outcome. It provides a path for the preservation of both gene copies without the immediate need for a rare, beneficial gain-of-function mutation. Furthermore, some evolutionary models suggest that subfunctionalization can serve as an intermediate step, preserving duplicate genes that may later evolve new functions through neofunctionalization.\n\n<<<D>>>"
