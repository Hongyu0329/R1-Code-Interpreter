    "On Sir Isaac Newton's color circle, the range between the color produced by combining yellow and blue—which is green—and blue itself corresponds to the musical notes G and A.\n\nNewton famously created a color wheel where he analogized the divisions of the visible light spectrum to the notes of a musical scale. In his system, based on the Dorian mode starting on the note D, each of the seven colors of the rainbow was assigned a specific musical note.\n\nFollowing this system:\n*   The color **green** is associated with the musical note **G**.\n*   The color **blue** is associated with the musical note **A**.\n\nTherefore, the musical range between green and blue on Newton's color circle encompasses the notes G and A.\n\n<<<G to A>>>"
