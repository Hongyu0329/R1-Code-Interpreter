    "The three longest rivers mentioned in Virgil's epic poem, the Aeneid, that have real-world counterparts with measurable lengths are the Po (associated with the mythological Eridanus), the Hebrus, and the Tiber.\n\nThe longest of these is the **Po River**, which flows through Italy. In the Aeneid, the mythological river Eridanus is mentioned, which is often identified with the Po. The Po River has a length of approximately 405 miles (652 kilometers).\n\nThe second longest is the **Hebrus River**, now known as the Maritsa or Evros. This river flows through the Balkans. The Hebrus is mentioned in the Aeneid in the context of the Thracian hero Orpheus. Its length is estimated to be between 298 and 329 miles (480 to 530 kilometers).\n\nThe third is the **Tiber River**, the most significant river in the narrative of the Aeneid as it flows through Rome, the city Aeneas is destined to found. The Tiber is the third-longest river in Italy, with a length of about 252 miles (406 kilometers).\n\nOther rivers are mentioned in the Aeneid, such as the mythological rivers of the underworld like the Styx, Acheron, Lethe, Phlegethon, and Cocytus. While these are significant in the narrative, they do not have defined lengths in the real world. The real-world Acheron river in Greece is much shorter, at around 32-36 miles (52-58 kilometers). Another earthly river mentioned is the Eurotas in Sparta, which is approximately 51 miles (82 kilometers) long.\n\n<<<The three longest rivers mentioned in the Aeneid with real-world measurable lengths are the Po (Eridanus), Hebrus, and Tiber.>>>"
