    "The nucleotide sequence provided is from the middle of an open reading frame (ORF). To determine the correct protein sequence, the DNA must be translated in all three possible reading frames. The correct frame will be the one that is \"open,\" meaning it does not contain any stop codons (TAA, TAG, TGA).\n\nThe provided sequence is: `ggacattgttgttagcgaagacttgaatggaacggtgaagttttcaagctctttaccctaccccaataatcttaacagtgtcctggctgagcgactggagaagtggc`\n\n1.  **Frame 1 Analysis**: Starting with the first nucleotide (`g`), the codons are `gga cat tgt tgt tag...`. The fifth codon, `tag`, is a stop codon. Therefore, this is not the correct reading frame.\n2.  **Frame 2 Analysis**: Starting with the second nucleotide (`g`), the codons are `gac att gtt gtt agc...`. Translating this entire frame reveals no stop codons. This continuous stretch of amino-acid-coding codons indicates it is the correct open reading frame.\n3.  **Frame 3 Analysis**: Starting with the third nucleotide (`a`), the codons are `aca ttg ttg tta gcg aag act tga...`. The eighth codon, `tga`, is a stop codon, ruling out this reading frame.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct reading frame is Frame 2.\n\n**Reading Frame:** 2\n\n**Protein Sequence:**\n<<<DIVVVSEDLNGTVKFSSSLPYPNNLNSVLADELREW>>>"
