    "The user is asking for the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a reductive group of type $E_8$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$.\n\nBased on the theory of reductive groups over finite fields, the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-conjugacy classes of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori is given by the number of $F$-conjugacy classes in the Weyl group $W$. When the group is split over $\\mathbb{F}_q$, the Frobenius endomorphism $F$ acts trivially on the Weyl group, and the $F$-conjugacy classes are simply the ordinary conjugacy classes of the Weyl group. Groups of type $E_8$ are simply-laced and have a trivial automorphism group of the Dynkin diagram, so any reductive group of type $E_8$ is split over any field $\\mathbb{F}_q$. Thus, the question reduces to finding the number of conjugacy classes of the Weyl group of type $E_8$, denoted $W(E_8)$.\n\nI have searched for this number. The search results confirm that the number of conjugacy classes of $W(E_8)$ is a known value. Specifically, result from a talk by George Lusztig at MIT states: \"cl(W) has been described by Carter (1972); ♯cl(W) = 112, ♯{C ∈ cl(W);C elliptic} = 30.\". Here, `cl(W)` denotes the set of conjugacy classes of the Weyl group $W = W(E_8)$, and `♯cl(W)` is its cardinality.\n\nTherefore, the number of conjugacy classes is 112.\n\nLet me double-check this information with another source if possible. The work of R.W. Carter, \"Conjugacy classes in the Weyl group\", is the definitive reference for this. The result is widely cited. The number 112 appears to be correct.\n\nThe other search results, while relevant to the Weyl group $W(E_8)$, do not directly state the number of conjugacy classes. For example, they give the order of the group, which is $|W(E_8)| = 696,729,600$. This is not the number of conjugacy classes.\n\nResult discusses positive conjugacy classes. It does not give the total number of conjugacy classes.\n\nResult discusses z-classes, which are related to but different from conjugacy classes.\n\nResult is the most direct and authoritative answer I have found. The information is very specific.\n\nI am confident that the number of conjugacy classes in the Weyl group $W(E_8)$ is 112, and this corresponds to the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori for a group of type $E_8$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$.\n\nFinal check of the logic:\n1.  The user wants the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a reductive group $G$ of type $E_8$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$.\n2.  The $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori are classified up to $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$-conjugacy by the $F$-conjugacy classes of the Weyl group $W$.\n3.  For a group of type $E_8$, the Dynkin diagram has no non-trivial automorphisms, so the group is always split over any finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$.\n4.  For a split group, the Frobenius action $F$ on the Weyl group is trivial.\n5.  Therefore, the $F$-conjugacy classes are just the ordinary conjugacy classes of $W$.\n6.  The problem is reduced to finding the number of conjugacy classes of the Weyl group $W(E_8)$.\n7.  According to a reliable source (Lusztig, citing Carter), this number is 112.\n\nThe reasoning is sound. I am ready to provide the final answer.\n\n<<<112>>>"
