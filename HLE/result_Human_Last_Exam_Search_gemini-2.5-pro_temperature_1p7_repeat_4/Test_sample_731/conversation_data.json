    "The semidihedral group of size 512, denoted as SD_512, has a total of 9 power subgroups.\n\nA power subgroup of a group G is a subgroup H that can be formed by taking all the m-th powers of the elements of G for some integer m. This is represented as H = G^m = {g^m | g âˆˆ G}.\n\nThe semidihedral group SD_{2^n} is defined by the presentation <a, b | a^(2^(n-1)) = b^2 = 1, bab = a^(2^(n-2) - 1)>. For SD_512, we have n=9, giving the presentation <a, b | a^256 = b^2 = 1, bab = a^127>.\n\nThe power subgroups of SD_512 can be determined by considering two cases for the integer exponent m:\n\n1.  **When m is odd:** The set of all m-th powers of elements of SD_512 results in the group itself. Thus, for any odd integer m, the power subgroup G^m is SD_512. This contributes one distinct power subgroup.\n\n2.  **When m is even:** For any even integer m, the power subgroup G^m is a cyclic subgroup generated by an element a^d, where d is the greatest common divisor of m and 256. Specifically, the subgroup is <a^d>. Since m must be even, d must also be an even divisor of 256. The even divisors of 256 are 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, and 256. Each of these divisors gives rise to a distinct power subgroup:\n    *   <a^2>\n    *   <a^4>\n    *   <a^8>\n    *   <a^16>\n    *   <a^32>\n    *   <a^64>\n    *   <a^128>\n    *   <a^256> (which is the trivial subgroup containing only the identity element)\n\nThis accounts for 8 distinct power subgroups.\n\nCombining both cases, the total number of distinct power subgroups in the semidihedral group of size 512 is 1 (from the odd exponents) + 8 (from the even exponents), which equals 9.\n\n<<<9>>>"
