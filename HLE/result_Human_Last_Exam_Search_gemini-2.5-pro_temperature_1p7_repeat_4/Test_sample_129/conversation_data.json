    "To find the number of true boolean expressions that can be written using exactly 5 of the symbols {T, F, !, &, |, (, )}, we can systematically categorize and count all valid, true expressions based on their structure. The precedence of operators is ! > & > |.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the possible structures for a 5-symbol expression:\n\n### 1. Chained Unary Operators\nThis structure consists of a chain of negation operators (`!`) applied to a boolean constant (`T` or `F`). To have a length of 5, there must be four `!` operators and one constant.\n*   `!!!!T`: This evaluates to `!!!F` → `!!T` → `!F` → `T`. This expression is true.\n*   `!!!!F`: This evaluates to `!!!T` → `!!F` → `!T` → `F`. This expression is false.\nThis gives us **1** true expression.\n\n### 2. Expressions with Two Binary Operators\nThese are expressions of the form `v op1 v op2 v`, where `v` is either `T` or `F`, and `op1`, `op2` are `&` or `|`. Due to precedence, no parentheses are needed. There are 2³ = 8 possible assignments of `T`/`F` for the three variables.\n\n*   **`v & v | v`**: This is parsed as `(v1 & v2) | v3`. The expression is true if `v3` is `T` (4 combinations), or if `v3` is `F` and `v1 & v2` is `T` (which means `v1=T` and `v2=T`, 1 combination). This gives **5** true expressions.\n*   **`v | v & v`**: This is parsed as `v1 | (v2 & v3)`. The expression is true if `v1` is `T` (4 combinations), or if `v1` is `F` and `v2 & v3` is `T` (which means `v2=T` and `v3=T`, 1 combination). This gives **5** true expressions.\n\n### 3. Expressions with Mixed Operators (No Parentheses)\nThese expressions involve a combination of unary and binary operators, totaling 5 symbols.\n\n*   **`!v op !v`**: (e.g., `!T&!F`, 5 symbols). The expression is `(!v1) op (!v2)`.\n    *   `&`: `!F & !F` is the only true expression (T & T = T). (1)\n    *   `|`: `!T|!F`, `!F|!T`, and `!F|!F` are true. (3)\n    This gives a total of **4** true expressions.\n\n*   **`!!v op v`**: (e.g., `!!T&F`, 5 symbols). The expression is `(!(!v1)) op v2`.\n    *   `&`: `!!T & T` is the only true expression (T & T = T). (1)\n    *   `|`: `!!T|T`, `!!T|F`, and `!!F|T` are true. (3)\n    This gives a total of **4** true expressions.\n\n*   **`v op !!v`**: (e.g., `T&!!F`, 5 symbols). The expression is `v1 op (!(!v2))`.\n    *   `&`: `T & !!T` is the only true expression (T & T = T). (1)\n    *   `|`: `T|!!T`, `T|!!F`, and `F|!!T` are true. (3)\n    This gives a total of **4** true expressions.\n\n### 4. Expressions with Parentheses\nFor the total length to be 5, the parentheses must enclose an expression of exactly 3 symbols. The structure is `(E3)`.\n\n*   **`(v op v)`**:\n    *   `(T&T)` is true. (1)\n    *   `(T|T)`, `(T|F)`, and `(F|T)` are true. (3)\n    This gives **4** true expressions.\n\n*   **`(!!v)`**:\n    *   `(!!T)` evaluates to `(T)`, which is `T`. This is a true expression. (1)\n    *   `(!!F)` evaluates to `(F)`, which is `F`.\n\n### Summary of True Expressions\n\nAdding up the counts from each category:\n*   From chained operators: 1\n*   From `v & v | v`: 5\n*   From `v | v & v`: 5\n*   From `!v op !v`: 4\n*   From `!!v op v`: 4\n*   From `v op !!v`: 4\n*   From `(v op v)`: 4\n*   From `(!!v)`: 1\n\nTotal number of true boolean expressions is 1 + 5 + 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 28.\n\n<<<28>>>"
