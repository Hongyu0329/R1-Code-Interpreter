    "The Christian theologian who first developed specialized terminology to describe changes in the laws of nature, applicable to both the virgin birth of Jesus and potential alterations in natural laws at the Fall, was **Augustine of Hippo**.\n\nAugustine was the first Christian writer to systematically explain the possibility of miracles within a world governed by a divine order. He argued that miracles are not, in fact, \"contrary to nature,\" but rather \"contrary to what we know of nature\" (*portentum fit non contra naturam, sed contra quam est nota natura*). This conceptual framing is a key part of his specialized approach.\n\nTo explain how such events are possible without violating the created order, Augustine developed the doctrine of **\"seminal reasons\"** (*rationes seminales*). He posited that when God created the world, He implanted these \"seeds\" or hidden potentialities within nature. From this perspective:\n\n*   **The Virgin Birth:** The virgin birth would not be a violation of natural law, but the actualization of a \"seminal reason\" placed in creation by God from the beginning, hidden until the appointed time.\n*   **The Fall:** While the search results focus more on miracles, this framework can also apply to changes in the natural world after the Fall. Such changes would be understood not as God breaking his own laws, but as the unfolding of different potentialities within creation as a consequence of sin, always in accordance with God's ultimate will, which Augustine equated with the \"nature\" of a thing.\n\nThe philosopher William Vallicella has more recently termed Augustine's framework the **\"epistemic theory of miracles,\"** distinguishing it from the \"ontic\" view that miracles are an actual breaking of natural law. This modern label highlights the specialized nature of Augustine's thought.\n\n<<<Augustine of Hippo>>>"
