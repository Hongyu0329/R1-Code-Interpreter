    "To determine the oligomeric state of the coiled-coil sequence `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG`, we must first understand the principles of \"knobs-into-holes\" packing and how the amino acid sequence dictates this structure.\n\n### 1. The Heptad Repeat\n\nCoiled coils are characterized by a repeating sequence of seven amino acids, known as a heptad repeat, designated by the letters `a-b-c-d-e-f-g`. The stability of the coiled-coil structure comes from the burial of hydrophobic side chains at the interface between the helices. The positions `a` and `d` are the core positions, typically occupied by hydrophobic residues. The interactions between these residues, a \"knob\" from one helix fitting into a \"hole\" formed by residues on the adjacent helix, determine the oligomeric state.\n\n### 2. Identifying the Heptad Register\n\nWe must first identify the correct heptad register for the given sequence. The goal is to place hydrophobic residues at the `a` and `d` positions. The sequence is 30 amino acids long, representing just over four full heptads.\n\n`G E I A Q S L K E I A K S L K E I A W S L K E I A Q S L K G`\n\nLet's test possible registers by assigning the first residue to each of the seven positions and examining the resulting amino acids at the core `a` and `d` positions.\n\n*   **Frame 1 (starting at `a`):** `a`-residues = G,K,K,K; `d`-residues = A,I,I,I. This is unlikely due to the charged (K) and small (G) residues at the core `a` position.\n*   **Frame 2 (starting at `g`):** `a`-residues = E,E,E,E; `d`-residues = Q,K,W,Q. This is highly unlikely as the charged residue E would be in the hydrophobic core.\n*   **Frame 3 (starting at `f`):** `a`-residues = I,I,I,I; `d`-residues = S,S,S,S. Unlikely, as the polar residue S is consistently in the core `d` position.\n*   **Frame 4 (starting at `e`):** `a`-residues = A,A,A,A; `d`-residues = L,L,L,L. This is a plausible hydrophobic core.\n*   **Frame 5 (starting at `d`):** `a`-residues = Q,K,W,Q; `d`-residues = G,K,K,K. Unlikely due to non-hydrophobic residues.\n*   **Frame 6 (starting at `c`):** `a`-residues = S,S,S,S; `d`-residues = E,E,E,E. Highly unlikely.\n*   **Frame 7 (starting at `b`):** `a`-residues = L,L,L,L; `d`-residues = I,I,I,I. This is also a very plausible hydrophobic core.\n\nWe are left with two plausible registers:\n1.  **Frame 4:** Alanine (A) at position `a`, and Leucine (L) at position `d`.\n2.  **Frame 7:** Leucine (L) at position `a`, and Isoleucine (I) at position `d`.\n\n### 3. Oligomeric State from Core Residue Identity\n\nExtensive experimental studies have established rules based on knobs-into-holes packing efficiency that link the identity of amino acids at the `a` and `d` positions to the resulting oligomeric state.\n\n*   **Dimer:** Isoleucine (I) at `a` and Leucine (L) at `d`.\n*   **Trimer:** Isoleucine (I) at both `a` and `d`.\n*   **Tetramer:** Leucine (L) at `a` and Isoleucine (I) at `d`.\n\nThe register from **Frame 7**, which places Leucine (L) consistently at the `a` position and Isoleucine (I) consistently at the `d` position, perfectly matches the established pattern for forming a **tetramer**. The specific shapes of the leucine (γ-branched) and isoleucine (β-branched) side chains lead to the most efficient and stable knobs-into-holes packing in a four-helix bundle arrangement.\n\nWhile the other plausible register (A at `a`, L at `d`) might form stable coiled-coils, it does not correspond to a clear-cut rule for a specific oligomer state and is less predictive than the L/I pattern. The remarkable consistency of `L` at all `a` positions and `I` at all `d` positions in the Frame 7 register provides a very strong signal that the protein is designed to be a tetramer.\n\nTherefore, the protein coiled-coil sequence `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG` would have an oligomeric state of 4.\n\n<<<C>>>"
