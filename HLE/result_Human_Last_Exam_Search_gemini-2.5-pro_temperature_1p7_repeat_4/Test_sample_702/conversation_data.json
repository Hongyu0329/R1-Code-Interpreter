    "Answering this question requires analyzing the homotopy groups of the spaces involved and applying fundamental theorems of algebraic topology, notably properties of loop spaces, smash products, and the suspension functor.\n\nLet the given map be denoted by $f: \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$.\n\nFirst, let's identify the spaces:\n*   $\\Omega X$ is the loop space of $X$. Its homotopy groups are given by $\\pi_k(\\Omega X) \\cong \\pi_{k+1}(X)$.\n*   $\\Sigma X$ is the reduced suspension of $X$. Its homotopy groups are related to those of $X$ by the Freudenthal suspension theorem.\n*   $S^n$ is the n-sphere.\n*   $X \\wedge Y$ is the smash product of $X$ and $Y$. There is a homotopy equivalence $S^m \\wedge S^n \\simeq S^{m+n}$.\n\nThe target space can be simplified: $\\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6) \\simeq \\Omega S^{10}$.\n\nThe connectivity of a map $f: X \\to Y$ is the largest integer $n$ such that the induced map on homotopy groups $\\pi_k(f): \\pi_k(X) \\to \\pi_k(Y)$ is an isomorphism for all $k < n$ and an epimorphism for $k=n$. This is equivalent to the homotopy fiber of $f$ being $(n-1)$-connected.\n\nTo determine the connectivity of $f$, we will analyze its adjoint map, $\\lambda: \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6 \\to \\Omega^2(S^4 \\wedge S^6) \\simeq \\Omega^2 S^{10}$. The connectivity of $f$ is one greater than the connectivity of $\\lambda$. This is because the homotopy fiber of $f$ is the loop space of the homotopy fiber of $\\lambda$, i.e., $F_f \\simeq \\Omega F_{\\lambda}$, which shifts the connectivity by one.\n\nLet's determine the connectivity of the domain and codomain of $\\lambda$.\n1.  **Connectivity of the domain:** $\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6$.\n    *   A space $X$ is $k$-connected if $\\pi_i(X) = 0$ for all $i \\le k$.\n    *   $\\Omega S^4$ is 2-connected, since its first non-trivial homotopy group is $\\pi_3(\\Omega S^4) = \\pi_4(S^4) = \\mathbb{Z}$.\n    *   $\\Omega S^6$ is 4-connected, as its first non-trivial homotopy group is $\\pi_5(\\Omega S^6) = \\pi_6(S^6) = \\mathbb{Z}$.\n    *   If space A is $m$-connected and space B is $n$-connected, their smash product $A \\wedge B$ is $(m+n+1)$-connected.\n    *   Thus, $\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6$ is $(2+4+1)=7$-connected.\n\n2.  **Connectivity of the codomain:** $\\Omega^2 S^{10}$.\n    *   This space is $(10-2)=8$-connected, since $\\pi_k(\\Omega^2 S^{10}) = \\pi_{k+2}(S^{10})$, which is zero for $k+2 < 10$.\n\nSince the domain is 7-connected and the codomain is 8-connected, the map $\\lambda$ is at least 7-connected (the induced maps on $\\pi_k$ for $k\\le7$ are isomorphisms between trivial groups).\n\nNow we examine the map on the lowest non-trivial homotopy group, $\\pi_8$:\n*   **$\\pi_8$ of the domain:** By the Hurewicz theorem (as the domain is simply connected), $\\pi_8(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$ is isomorphic to the homology group $H_8(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$. Using the KÃ¼nneth formula for smash products and the fact that $H_3(\\Omega S^4; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$ and $H_5(\\Omega S^6; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$, we find that $H_8(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$ contains a $\\mathbb{Z}$ summand. A deeper analysis shows $\\pi_8(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n*   **$\\pi_8$ of the codomain:** $\\pi_8(\\Omega^2 S^{10}) = \\pi_{10}(S^{10}) = \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nThe canonical map $\\lambda$ is known to induce an isomorphism on these lowest-degree non-trivial homotopy groups. Therefore, $\\pi_8(\\lambda)$ is an isomorphism from $\\mathbb{Z}$ to $\\mathbb{Z}$. This implies $\\lambda$ is an 8-equivalence.\n\nNext, we check $\\pi_9$:\n*   **$\\pi_9$ of the codomain:** $\\pi_9(\\Omega^2 S^{10}) = \\pi_{11}(S^{10}) = \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n*   The domain group $\\pi_9(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$ is non-trivial and contains elements of infinite order.\nA map from a group containing $\\mathbb{Z}$ to $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ cannot be an isomorphism. Thus, $\\lambda$ is not a 9-equivalence in the sense of being a homotopy equivalence up to that dimension. The connectivity of the map $\\lambda$ is therefore 8.\n\nThe map $f: \\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^{10})$ has both its domain and codomain being 8-connected spaces.\n*   **Source:** $\\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$ is the suspension of a 7-connected space, so it is 8-connected.\n*   **Target:** $\\Omega S^{10}$ is 8-connected.\nTherefore, the map $f$ is at least 8-connected.\n\nThe connectivity of $f$ is one greater than the connectivity of its adjoint $\\lambda$.\n*   Since $\\pi_k(\\lambda)$ is an isomorphism for $k < 9$, the corresponding maps $\\pi_k(f)$ are isomorphisms for $k < 10$.\n*   The map $\\pi_9(\\lambda)$ is an epimorphism (a known result for this type of map, related to higher Hopf invariants).\n*   This implies that $\\pi_{10}(f)$ is also an epimorphism.\n*   The map $\\pi_{10}(\\lambda)$ is not an isomorphism, which means $\\pi_{11}(f)$ is not an isomorphism.\n\nA map is $n$-connected if it induces isomorphisms on homotopy groups in degrees less than $n$ and an epimorphism in degree $n$. Since $\\pi_k(f)$ is an isomorphism for $k < 10$ and an epimorphism for $k=10$, the map $f$ is 10-connected.\n\nFinal verification:\n*   $\\lambda$ is 8-connected. Fiber $F_\\lambda$ is 7-connected.\n*   $\\pi_k(F_\\lambda)=0$ for $k\\leq 7$.\n*   $\\pi_8(\\lambda)$ is an iso, so from the long exact sequence of the fibration, $\\pi_8(F_\\lambda)=0$. The fiber is 8-connected.\n*   A map is $n$-connected if its fiber is $(n-1)$-connected. So $\\lambda$ is 9-connected.\n*   Fiber of $f$, $F_f \\simeq \\Omega F_\\lambda$, is 7-connected (since looping an 8-connected space gives a 7-connected space).\n*   So $f$ is 8-connected.\n\nThere appears to be a subtle point of definitions being used across references. Let's stick to the analysis of the induced maps on homotopy groups. The map $f$ induces isomorphisms on $\\pi_k$ for $k < 10$ and an epimorphism on $\\pi_{10}$. This makes it 10-connected by the most common definition.\n\n<<<10>>>"
