    "The given integral equation is a Fredholm integral equation of the second kind:\n$u(x) = 1 + \\lambda \\int_0^1 K(x, y) u(y) dy$\nwhere the kernel is $K(x, y) = \\frac{x^n - y^n}{x - y}$.\n\nThe kernel can be written as a sum of polynomials:\n$K(x, y) = \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1-k} y^k$\nThis shows that the kernel is a degenerate (or separable) kernel. The solution u(x), if it exists, must be a polynomial of degree at most n-1.\n\nAccording to the Fredholm alternative theorem, this equation has no solution if:\n1.  λ is a characteristic value, meaning the associated homogeneous equation $u_h(x) = \\lambda \\int_0^1 K(x, y) u_h(y) dy$ has a non-trivial solution (an eigenfunction).\n2.  The forcing term, $f(x)=1$, is not orthogonal to the eigenfunctions of the adjoint homogeneous equation.\n\nThe kernel $K(x,y)$ is symmetric, since $K(y,x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} y^{n-1-k} x^k = K(x,y)$. Therefore, the integral operator is self-adjoint, and the adjoint eigenfunctions are the same as the eigenfunctions $u_h(x)$.\n\nThe condition for no solution simplifies to:\n1.  λ is an eigenvalue of the integral operator.\n2.  $\\int_0^1 1 \\cdot u_h(x) dx \\neq 0$ for the corresponding eigenfunction $u_h(x)$.\n\nWe can convert the homogeneous integral equation into a system of linear equations to find the eigenvalues. An eigenfunction $u_h(x)$ must be a polynomial of degree n-1. Let's write it as:\n$u_h(x) = \\lambda \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1-k} \\left(\\int_0^1 y^k u_h(y) dy\\right)$\nLet $c_k = \\int_0^1 y^k u_h(y) dy$. Then $u_h(x) = \\lambda \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} c_k x^{n-1-k}$.\nSubstituting this back into the definition of $c_j$:\n$c_j = \\int_0^1 y^j \\left(\\lambda \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} c_k y^{n-1-k}\\right) dy = \\lambda \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} c_k \\int_0^1 y^{j+n-1-k} dy$\n$c_j = \\lambda \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \\frac{c_k}{j+n-k}$\n\nThis is an eigenvalue problem $C = \\lambda M C$, or $M C = \\frac{1}{\\lambda} C$, where C is the vector of coefficients $[c_0, c_1, \\dots, c_{n-1}]^T$ and M is an n x n matrix with entries $M_{jk} = \\frac{1}{j+n-k}$ for $j, k \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, n-1\\}$. The characteristic values λ are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the matrix M.\n\nNow, we check the second condition: $\\int_0^1 u_h(x) dx \\neq 0$.\n$\\int_0^1 u_h(x) dx = \\int_0^1 \\left(\\lambda \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} c_k x^{n-1-k}\\right) dx = \\lambda \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \\frac{c_k}{n-k}$.\nFrom the first row (j=0) of the matrix equation $M C = \\frac{1}{\\lambda} C$, we have:\n$\\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} M_{0k} c_k = \\frac{1}{\\lambda} c_0 \\implies \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \\frac{c_k}{n-k} = \\frac{1}{\\lambda} c_0$.\nThus, the integral is $\\int_0^1 u_h(x) dx = \\lambda \\left(\\frac{1}{\\lambda} c_0\\right) = c_0$.\nThe condition for no solution is therefore $c_0 \\neq 0$.\n\nIf $c_0 = \\int_0^1 u_h(y) dy = 0$, then the integral equation would have a solution. Let's see if this is possible. If $c_0=0$, the system of equations for the eigenvector coefficients becomes inconsistent for $n \\ge 2$, leading to only the trivial solution $C=0$. For example, for $n=2$ and $c_0=0$, the system becomes $c_1/1 = \\frac{1}{\\lambda}c_0=0$ and $c_1/2=\\frac{1}{\\lambda}c_1$. The first equation implies $c_1=0$, yielding only the trivial solution. A similar contradiction arises for any n. Thus, no eigenfunction of this operator can be orthogonal to $f(x)=1$.\n\nTherefore, the equation has no solution for all values of λ that are eigenvalues of the integral operator. These are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the matrix M defined by $M_{jk} = \\frac{1}{j+n-k}$.\n\nLet's find these values for specific n:\n*   **Case n=1:** $K(x,y) = 1$. The equation is $u(x) = 1 + \\lambda \\int_0^1 u(y)dy$. Letting $c = \\int_0^1 u(y)dy$, we get $u(x) = 1 + \\lambda c$. Integrating gives $c = 1 + \\lambda c$, or $c(1-\\lambda) = 1$. If $\\lambda=1$, we have $0=1$, which is impossible. Thus, for n=1, there is no solution when $\\lambda=1$.\n*   **Case n=2:** $K(x,y) = x+y$. The matrix M is $M = \\begin{pmatrix} 1/2 & 1 \\\\ 1/3 & 1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$. The eigenvalue equation is $\\det(M-\\mu I)=0$, where $\\mu=1/\\lambda$.\n    $(\\frac{1}{2}-\\mu)^2 - \\frac{1}{3} = 0 \\implies \\mu^2 - \\mu + \\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{1}{3} = 0 \\implies \\mu^2 - \\mu - \\frac{1}{12} = 0$.\n    The solutions for μ are $\\mu = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{1+1/3}}{2} = \\frac{1}{2} \\pm \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}$.\n    The values for λ are the reciprocals:\n    $\\lambda = \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{2} \\pm \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}} = \\frac{2\\sqrt{3}}{\\sqrt{3} \\pm 2} = \\frac{2\\sqrt{3}(\\sqrt{3} \\mp 2)}{3-4} = -2\\sqrt{3}(\\sqrt{3} \\mp 2) = -6 \\pm 4\\sqrt{3}$.\n\nThe values of λ for which the equation has no solutions are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the n×n matrix M where $M_{jk} = \\frac{1}{j+n-k}$ for $j, k = 0, \\dots, n-1$.\n\n<<<The values of λ for which the equation has no solutions are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the n x n matrix M with entries $M_{jk} = \\frac{1}{j+n-k}$, for $j, k = 0, 1, \\dots, n-1$.>>>"
