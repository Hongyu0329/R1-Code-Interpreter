    "The space-time, double Fourier transform of the generalized pair correlation function, G(r,t), is formally known as the **dynamic structure factor**, denoted as S(k,ω) or S(q,ω). This terminology is used across various fields of physics, including in the nuclear criticality community, particularly in the context of thermal neutron scattering and reactor physics calculations.\n\nIn inelastic neutron scattering, the intensity of scattered neutrons is directly proportional to the dynamic structure factor, which is the double Fourier transform of the time-dependent pair correlation function. This relationship is fundamental for understanding the interaction of neutrons with materials in a nuclear reactor. In reactor physics, the dynamic structure factor is crucial for generating thermal neutron scattering cross-section data, which is essential for accurate modeling of nuclear systems and criticality safety analyses.\n\nHowever, in the practical context of experimental nuclear criticality measurements, while the underlying physics is described by the same correlation functions, the community more commonly uses the terminology associated with **neutron noise analysis**. The most prominent among these is the **Rossi-alpha method**.\n\nThe Rossi-alpha technique directly measures the time correlation between neutron detections to determine the prompt neutron decay constant, α. This constant is a critical parameter for assessing the state of a nuclear system. The analysis in the Rossi-alpha method is performed in the time domain, but it is fundamentally related to the same neutron correlation phenomena described by the pair correlation function. The Fourier transform of the autocorrelation function of the neutron noise is the auto power spectral density (APSD), which is another key quantity in frequency-domain noise analysis.\n\nTherefore, while **dynamic structure factor** is the correct technical name for the space-time double Fourier transform of the generalized pair correlation function and is used in theoretical and computational contexts within the nuclear field, the more common vernacular in the experimental nuclear criticality community when discussing neutron correlation measurements revolves around the **Rossi-alpha method** and **neutron noise analysis**.\n\n<<<dynamic structure factor>>>"
