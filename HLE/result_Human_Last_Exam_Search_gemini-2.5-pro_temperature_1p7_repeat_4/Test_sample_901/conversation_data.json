    "When (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane is treated with potassium tert-butoxide in tert-butyl alcohol, an elimination reaction occurs. The product of this reaction is **3-methylcyclohexene**.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the reaction mechanism:\n*   **Reaction Type**: The combination of a secondary alkyl halide with a strong, bulky base like potassium tert-butoxide (KOtBu) strongly favors an E2 (bimolecular elimination) reaction.\n*   **Stereochemistry Requirement**: The E2 mechanism has a strict stereochemical requirement: the leaving group (bromine) and the proton being removed must be in an anti-periplanar, or trans-diaxial, orientation. This means that in the chair conformation of the cyclohexane ring, both the leaving group and the proton must be in axial positions, with one pointing up and the other down.\n*   **Conformation of the Reactant**: The starting material is the (1S,2R) isomer of 1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane. This is a trans isomer. In its most stable chair conformation, the larger methyl group occupies an equatorial position to minimize steric strain, which forces the smaller bromine atom into an axial position.\n*   **Elimination Pathway**: With the bromine atom in an axial position, the base can only remove a proton that is also in an axial position on an adjacent carbon.\n    *   On the carbon atom bearing the methyl group (C2), the hydrogen is in an equatorial position, not axial. Therefore, elimination to form the more substituted alkene (1-methylcyclohexene, the Zaitsev product) is not possible.\n    *   On the other adjacent carbon (C6), there is a hydrogen atom in the required axial position.\n*   **Product Formation**: Due to the stereochemical constraint, the potassium tert-butoxide is forced to abstract the axial proton from C6. This results in the formation of a double bond between C1 and C6, yielding the less substituted alkene.\n\nTherefore, the stereochemistry of the starting material dictates that only one product can be formed via the E2 mechanism, which is 3-methylcyclohexene, also known as the Hofmann product.\n\n<<<3-methylcyclohexene>>>"
