    "A self-avoiding walk on a Manhattan lattice, also known as a square lattice, is a path on the grid that does not visit the same point more than once. The number of such walks of a specific length, 'n', is denoted by a(n).\n\nFor a 10-step self-avoiding walk, the number of possible paths, a(10), has been calculated and is a known value in combinatorics. This value is part of the sequence A001411 in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS).\n\nThe sequence begins with a(1) = 4, a(2) = 12, a(3) = 36, and continues with increasing complexity. For a length of 10 steps, the number of distinct self-avoiding walks is 44,100.\n\n<<<44100>>>"
