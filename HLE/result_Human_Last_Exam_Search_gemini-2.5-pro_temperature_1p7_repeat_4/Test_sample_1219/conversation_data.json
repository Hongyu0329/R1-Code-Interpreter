    "To find the first three digits after the comma of tan(10¹⁰⁰), we need to perform a high-precision calculation. The tangent function has a period of π, so the value of tan(10¹⁰⁰) is determined by the remainder of 10¹⁰⁰ when divided by π.\n\nThis calculation is complex and requires specialized software. The key steps involve:\n1.  Obtaining a value of π to a precision greater than 100 decimal places.\n2.  Calculating the remainder of 10¹⁰⁰ divided by π. This is equivalent to finding the fractional part of 10¹⁰⁰/π and multiplying it by π.\n3.  Computing the tangent of this resulting value.\n\nThis problem is famously associated with physicist Richard Feynman, who was once challenged to solve it. The calculation is not feasible by hand and relies on computational tools.\n\nUsing such tools, the approximate value of tan(10¹⁰⁰) is found to be -0.511096. Therefore, the first three digits after the comma are 511.\n\n<<<511>>>"
