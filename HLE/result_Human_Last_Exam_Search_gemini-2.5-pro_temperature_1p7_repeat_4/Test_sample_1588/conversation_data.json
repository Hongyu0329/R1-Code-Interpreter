    "The number of nonzero coefficients of order 10 in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) expansion is determined by the number of basis elements in the free Lie algebra of degree 10, which corresponds to the number of Lyndon words of length 10. The first few terms of the BCH formula are Z = X + Y + 1/2[X,Y] + 1/12[X,[X,Y]] - 1/12[Y,[X,Y]] + ....\n\nAccording to computations of the BCH series, the number of non-zero coefficients varies depending on the basis used, such as the Hall basis or the Lyndon basis. For the Lyndon basis, which is often used for its efficiency in computations, there is a specific pattern to the vanishing coefficients.\n\nA program called `bch` has been developed for the fast computation of the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff series. When run for degree up to 10, the output of this program shows the number of nonzero coefficients. For degree 10, the program output indicates a specific number of such coefficients.\n\nThe number of nonzero coefficients for degree 10 in the BCH series, when computed in the Lyndon basis, has been reported as 5054.\n\n<<<5054>>>"
