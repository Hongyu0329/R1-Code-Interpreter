    "To determine the oligomeric state of the coiled-coil sequences, we must analyze the pattern of amino acids in the core `a` and `d` positions of the heptad repeat (`abcdefg`). The identity of the residues in these positions is the primary determinant of whether the helices will assemble into dimers, trimers, or tetramers.\n\nHere are the key principles based on extensive research:\n*   **Dimers** are often specified by having Isoleucine (I) at the `a` position and Leucine (L) at the `d` position. A polar residue like Asparagine (N) at an `a` position is also a very strong determinant for dimer formation.\n*   **Trimers** are often favored when Isoleucine (I) is found at both `a` and `d` positions. Bulky hydrophobic residues like Tryptophan (W) in the core also strongly promote trimerization.\n*   **Tetramers** are classically specified by having Leucine (L) at the `a` position and Isoleucine (I) at the `d` position.\n\nBased on the common hydrophobic patterns, the most likely heptad register for these sequences is `g(a)bc(d)ef`, where the first listed residue is `g` and the second (`I`) is at the `a` position. Let's analyze each sequence with this register.\n\n1.  **EIAQALKEIAKALKEIAWALKEIAQALK**\n    *   **Heptad Core (`a`/`d`)**:\n        *   `a` positions: I, I, I, I\n        *   `d` positions: A, A, W, A\n    *   **Analysis**: This sequence has a consistent Isoleucine at the `a` positions and mostly Alanine at the `d` positions (`IaAd`). This motif is generally consistent with a dimer. While one Tryptophan (W) at a `d` position can favor trimerization, the rest of the sequence's core promotes a dimer. In this context, the most likely state is a **Dimer (2)**.\n\n2.  **EIAALKQEIAALKKENAALKQEIAALKQ**\n    *   **Heptad Core (`a`/`d`)**:\n        *   `a` positions: I, I, N, I\n        *   `d` positions: A, A, A, A\n    *   **Analysis**: The core is mostly the dimeric `IaAd` motif. Critically, the sequence contains an Asparagine (N) residue at an `a` position. Polar residues like asparagine in the hydrophobic core are powerful determinants for **Dimer (2)** formation, as they can form specific hydrogen bonds that stabilize the two-stranded structure.\n\n3.  **EIAAIKQEIAAIKKEIAAIKWEIAAIKQ**\n    *   **Heptad Core (`a`/`d`)** (Re-parsing the sequence: R1=`EIAAIKQ`, R2=`EIAAIKK`, R3=`EIAAIKW`, R4=`EIAAIKQ` and applying the `g(a)bc(d)ef` register):\n        *   `a` positions: I, I, I, I\n        *   `d` positions: I, I, I, I\n    *   **Analysis**: The core consists exclusively of Isoleucine at both `a` and `d` positions (`IaId`). This specific arrangement leads to a different core packing geometry than dimers or trimers and is a classic hallmark of **Tetramer (4)** formation.\n\n4.  **EIQKQLKEIQKQLKEIQWQLKEIQKQLK**\n    *   **Heptad Core (`a`/`d`)**:\n        *   `a` positions: I, I, I, I\n        *   `d` positions: K, K, W, K\n    *   **Analysis**: This sequence has Isoleucine at the `a` positions. However, three of the four `d` positions are occupied by Lysine (K), a charged residue, which is highly disruptive to a stable hydrophobic core. The single Tryptophan (W) would favor a trimer, but the multiple charged residues likely destabilize higher-order oligomers. The most stable predictable state would be a **Dimer (2)**, as it is the simplest oligomeric form.\n\n5.  **EIAQTLKEIAKTLKEIAWTLKEIAQTLK**\n    *   **Heptad Core (`a`/`d`)**:\n        *   `a` positions: I, I, I, I\n        *   `d` positions: T, T, W, T\n    *   **Analysis**: The `a` positions are consistently Isoleucine, and the `d` positions contain a Tryptophan (W). Threonine (T) is a polar residue but can be accommodated in the core. The combination of consistent Isoleucine at `a` and a bulky Tryptophan (W) at `d` are strong indicators for **Trimer (3)** formation.\n\nCombining the analyses, the predicted oligomeric states are: 2, 2, 4, 2, 3.\n\n<<<D>>>"
