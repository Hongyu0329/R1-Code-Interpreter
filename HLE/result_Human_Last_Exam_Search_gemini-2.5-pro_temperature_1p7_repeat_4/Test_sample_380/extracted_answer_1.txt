The local magnetic field at the L1 point is generally not considered radial for the precise calculation of normalized magnetic helicity of Alfven Ion Cyclotron waves. While a simplified approach might use magnetic field components perpendicular to the radial direction (like the Y and Z components in the GSE coordinate system), a more accurate physical analysis requires transforming the magnetic field data into a coordinate system aligned with the local mean magnetic field. This is because AIC waves propagate along the local magnetic field, and their polarization (helicity) is defined by the rotation of the magnetic field vector in the plane perpendicular to this direction of propagation. The interplanetary magnetic field at L1 follows the Parker spiral and is subject to fluctuations, meaning it is not typically aligned with the radial direction. Therefore, using components perpendicular to the local field is the correct methodology.
