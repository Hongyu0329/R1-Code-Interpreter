    "On a 5x5 toroidal chessboard, there are 120 ways to place 4 non-attacking queens. This result is derived from a general formula for placing 4 non-attacking queens on an n x n toroidal board, as documented by combinatorial mathematics expert Vaclav Kotesovec.\n\nThe conditions for placing non-attacking queens on a toroidal board are that no two queens can share the same row, column, or any of the wrap-around diagonals. The formula for the number of ways to place 4 non-attacking queens on an n x n toroidal board (for n ≥ 4) is:\n\n(n(n-1)(n-2)(n-3)(n⁴ - 10n³ + 35n² - 50n + 24)) / 24\n\nFor a 5x5 board (n=5), the calculation is as follows:\n\n(5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * (5⁴ - 10(5³) + 35(5²) - 50(5) + 24)) / 24 =\n(120 * (625 - 1250 + 875 - 250 + 24)) / 24 =\n5 * (24) = 120\n\n<<<120>>>"
