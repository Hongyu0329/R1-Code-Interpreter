In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function G_0 has a simple inverse functional dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalues ϵ_k. In the frequency-momentum domain, this is expressed as G_0(ω, k) = 1 / (ω - ϵ_k + iδ), where ω is the energy and iδ is an infinitesimal term to ensure causality.
