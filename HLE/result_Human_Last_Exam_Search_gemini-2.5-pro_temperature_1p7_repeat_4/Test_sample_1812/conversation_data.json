    "To compute the determinant of the given matrix:\n\\[\nA = \\begin{bmatrix}\n2 & -1 & -1 \\\\\n-1 & 2 & -1 \\\\\n-1 & -1 & 2\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nWe can use the formula for the determinant of a 3x3 matrix:\ndet(A) = 2 * (2 * 2 - (-1) * (-1)) - (-1) * ((-1) * 2 - (-1) * (-1)) + (-1) * ((-1) * (-1) - 2 * (-1))\ndet(A) = 2 * (4 - 1) + 1 * (-2 - 1) - 1 * (1 + 2)\ndet(A) = 2 * 3 - 3 - 3\ndet(A) = 6 - 6\ndet(A) = 0\n\nAlternatively, one can notice that the sum of the rows (and columns) is 0:\n2 + (-1) + (-1) = 0\n(-1) + 2 + (-1) = 0\n(-1) + (-1) + 2 = 0\nThis means that the vectors forming the rows (or columns) are linearly dependent. A property of matrices is that if the rows or columns are linearly dependent, the determinant is 0. Specifically, if the sum of the columns of a matrix is the zero vector, then the vector is in the null space of the matrix, which means the matrix is singular and its determinant is 0.\n\nThe additional information \"adjacency matrix of the Markov quiver for \\( m_{1/2} = 13 \\)\" refers to a specific context in theoretical physics or mathematics, but the explicit provision of the matrix A makes the determinant calculation a direct mathematical problem. The given matrix is also recognizable as the Laplacian matrix of the complete graph on three vertices (Kâ‚ƒ), which is known to have a determinant of 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
