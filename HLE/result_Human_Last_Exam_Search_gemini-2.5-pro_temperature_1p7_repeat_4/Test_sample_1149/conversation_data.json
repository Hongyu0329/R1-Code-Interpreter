    "A detailed analysis of the skull of *Irritator challengeri* reveals the presence of a single depression within the lacrimal recess. This feature is technically referred to as the lacrimal antorbital recess.\n\nScientific studies, including 3D renderings and detailed diagrams of the dinosaur's skull, consistently label a single recess on the lacrimal bone. This depression is situated in the lacrimal bone, which separates the orbit of the eye from the antorbital fenestra (an opening in the skull in front of the eyes).\n\nThe lacrimal antorbital recess is a distinct anatomical feature, and examinations of the holotype specimen of *Irritator challengeri* have not indicated the presence of multiple depressions within this specific area. Therefore, the lacrimal recess in *Irritator challengeri* contains one depression.\n\n<<<1>>>"
