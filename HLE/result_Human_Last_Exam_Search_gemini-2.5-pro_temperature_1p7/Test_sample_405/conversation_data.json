    "Pure phosphorus exists in several allotropes, each with a distinct observable color. Through scientific discovery, five distinct colors of pure phosphorus allotropes have been identified: white, yellow, red, violet, and black.\n\nThe primary allotropes of phosphorus are white, red, and black. White phosphorus is a translucent, waxy solid. Upon exposure to light, it tends to turn yellow, and is thus often also referred to as yellow phosphorus.\n\nRed phosphorus, a more stable form, is dark red in appearance. It can be created by heating white phosphorus in the absence of air.\n\nAnother allotrope is violet phosphorus, also known as Hittorf's phosphorus. This form is obtained by annealing red phosphorus at high temperatures and has a characteristic red-purple color.\n\nThe most thermodynamically stable form of phosphorus is black phosphorus, which has a black, flaky appearance similar to graphite.\n\nAdditionally, other allotropes have been synthesized, such as blue phosphorus, which was first created in 2016. However, the name \"blue\" in this context refers to its wide band gap, a physical property, and there is no clear evidence it has a visually blue color. Diphosphorus is a gaseous form and does not have a described color under normal conditions.\n\nTherefore, the observable colors of pure phosphorus allotropes are white, yellow, red, violet, and black.\n\n<<<5>>>"
