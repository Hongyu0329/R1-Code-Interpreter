    "The final answer is $\\boxed{351}$. To determine the largest number of 9 by 1 by 1 blocks that fit inside a cube with an edge length of 15, we can use a logical packing strategy. The most efficient method, assuming the blocks are aligned with the cube's axes, involves dividing the cube into smaller sections based on the dimensions of the blocks.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the optimal packing strategy:\n*   The volume of the large cube is 15 x 15 x 15 = 3375 cubic units.\n*   The volume of a single block is 9 x 1 x 1 = 9 cubic units.\n*   Theoretically, based on volume alone, 3375 / 9 = 375 blocks could fit. However, the specific geometry of the blocks and the cube will likely prevent this maximum from being reached.\n\nA more effective method is to partition the 15x15x15 cube into eight smaller rectangular boxes by making cuts at 9 units along each of the three axes. This creates the following eight smaller boxes:\n1.  **9x9x9 box:** Can fit 9x9x1 = 81 blocks.\n2.  **Three 9x9x6 boxes:** Each can fit 9x6x1 = 54 blocks, for a total of 3 x 54 = 162 blocks.\n3.  **Three 9x6x6 boxes:** Each can fit 6x6x1 = 36 blocks, for a total of 3 x 36 = 108 blocks.\n4.  **One 6x6x6 box:** No blocks can fit in this box since the block's longest dimension (9) is larger than any dimension of this box.\n\nSumming the number of blocks from each of these smaller boxes gives the total number of blocks that can fit inside the cube:\n\n81 + 162 + 108 + 0 = 351 blocks.\n\nThis method leaves a 6x6x6 space unfilled, which is the most efficient way to pack the blocks under these constraints.\n\n<<<351>>>"
