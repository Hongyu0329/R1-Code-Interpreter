    "### Unveiling the Finite Filled Nilpotent Groups\n\nA finite group *G* is termed a \"filled group\" if the union of all its maximal by inclusion product-free sets equals the entire group *G*. A product-free set is a subset of a group that does not contain the product of any two of its elements. The classification of finite filled nilpotent groups has been established in mathematical literature.\n\nA finite nilpotent group is a filled group if and only if it is one of the following:\n\n*   **An elementary abelian 2-group:** This is a group where every element is its own inverse and the group is abelian.\n*   **The cyclic group of order 3, denoted as C₃.**\n*   **The cyclic group of order 5, denoted as C₅.**\n\nThis classification is a key result from the paper \"Groups whose locally maximal product-free sets are complete\" by C.S. Anabanti, S.B. Hart, and D. G. Loughlin. In their work, a \"filled group\" is equivalently defined as a group where every locally maximal product-free set is \"complete\". A product-free set *S* is considered complete if every non-identity element of the group *G* can be expressed as an element of *S* or as a product of two elements from *S*.\n\nThe paper first establishes the classification for finite abelian groups, showing they are filled if and only if they are an elementary abelian 2-group, C₃, or C₅. Building on this, the authors extend their analysis to the broader class of nilpotent groups. Since a finite nilpotent group is the direct product of its Sylow p-subgroups, the investigation of the \"filled\" property can be largely understood by examining these p-groups. The authors demonstrate that for a nilpotent group to be filled, it must conform to the limited list provided above.\n\n<<<A finite nilpotent group is filled if and only if it is an elementary abelian 2-group, the cyclic group of order 3, or the cyclic group of order 5.>>>"
