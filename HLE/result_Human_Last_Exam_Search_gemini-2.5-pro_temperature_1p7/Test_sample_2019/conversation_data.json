    "The initial search has provided some very relevant information but not the direct answer.\nHere's a summary of the findings:\n\n*   **P贸lya's Theorem:** A key result is that the n-queens problem on an n x n toroidal board has a solution (i.e., you can place *n* non-attacking queens) if and only if n is not divisible by 2 or 3. Since 5 is not divisible by 2 or 3, it's possible to place 5 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal board. The query is about 4 queens, not 5.\n*   The search results discuss the \"n-queens problem,\" which is about placing *n* queens on an *n*x*n* board. My question is about placing *k* queens (where k < n) on an *n*x*n* board, which is a variation.\n*   One result mentions the number of ways to place 5 non-attacking knights on a 5x5 toroidal board is 120, which is 5!. It hints at a possible connection to permutations for rooks. This might be a useful analogy but isn't directly about queens.\n*   Another search talks about the maximum number of non-attacking \"Amazons\" (a queen + knight) on a 5x5 board, which is 4. This is a different piece, but the number is intriguing.\n*   The search results provide context and related theorems but do not contain a direct calculation or statement of the number of ways to place 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal board.\n\nThe problem requires finding all possible configurations of 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal board. Since a direct answer hasn't been found, a more systematic approach is needed. I can try to find a resource that enumerates these configurations or a method to calculate them.\n\nSince this is a combinatorial problem, it might be solved by breaking it down. A toroidal board's \"wrap-around\" nature complicates manual counting. I need to be careful about overcounting due to the board's symmetries.\n\nThe next steps should be to look for either a direct enumeration or a methodology.The conducted searches provide a lot of context on the n-queens problem and its toroidal variant. I've learned about P贸lya's theorem, which states that *n* non-attacking queens can be placed on an *n*x*n* toroidal board if and only if *n* is not divisible by 2 or 3. This confirms that for n=5, a solution with 5 queens exists. However, my question is about placing 4 queens, not 5.\n\nThe search results delve into the complexity of counting solutions, especially for larger boards, and introduce the concept of quasipolynomials for this purpose. Unfortunately, they don't provide a straightforward formula or a direct answer for a 5x5 board with 4 queens. I found references to online judges and computational problems, which suggests that this problem might be best solved programmatically or by looking up the specific result in a database or a specialized publication.\n\nI have not yet found a direct statement of the number of ways to place 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal board. It seems this specific configuration is not as widely discussed as the n-queens problem.\n\nMy next step will be to search for resources that might have pre-computed this value or provide a method to compute it. I will also consider the symmetries of the toroidal board, as any solution will likely belong to a set of equivalent solutions under rotation and reflection. The final answer should be a single number. Given the lack of a direct formula so far, my next step is to look for this specific number in online databases of integer sequences or specialized chess-math websites.I have conducted several searches and have found a wealth of information on the n-queens problem and its toroidal variant. I've learned about P贸lya's theorem, which is a key theoretical result, and I've seen many references to the complexity of counting solutions.\n\nHowever, despite these extensive searches, I have not found a direct answer to the question: \"How many ways can you place 4 non-attacking queens on this board?\". The search results focus heavily on the case where the number of queens equals the board size (*n*-queens problem). There's theoretical work and computational results for *n*-queens, but not for the more general *k*-queens on an *n*x*n* toroidal board.\n\nI haven't been able to locate a specific entry in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) that directly corresponds to this problem. I tried searching for sequences related to toroidal queens problems, but none matched the specific parameters of this question.\n\nGiven that direct search and lookup have been exhausted, the most reliable way to answer this question would be through a computational approach. Since I cannot execute code, I need to find a source that has already performed this computation. It is possible the answer lies in a specialized paper or book that hasn't been easily accessible through my general searches.\n\nI am at a point where I have a good understanding of the problem's context but lack the specific numerical answer. Without the ability to perform my own calculations, I must rely on finding a published result. My last attempt will be to search for very specific terms that might lead to a forum post, a small paper, or a database entry I might have missed. I'll focus on terms that a person who has solved this specific problem might have used.I have performed multiple searches and have gathered significant information about the n-queens problem on a toroidal board. The key takeaway is P贸lya's theorem, which states that *n* non-attacking queens can be placed on an *n*x*n* toroidal board if and only if *n* is not divisible by 2 or 3. This is relevant for the 5x5 board, as it confirms solutions for 5 queens exist.\n\nHowever, the specific question is about placing *4* non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal board. None of the searches have provided a direct numerical answer to this specific problem. The resources found are either too general, focusing on the *n*-queens case, or they are research papers dealing with asymptotic results for large *n*. I have not found an enumeration for smaller boards with a number of queens different from the board size.\n\nI have exhausted the search queries that I can think of, including looking for specific OEIS entries. Without the ability to run a program to solve this through brute-force with symmetry reduction, I cannot authoritatively determine the number of configurations. The information available in the search results is insufficient to answer the question directly.\n\nI am unable to provide a final answer.\n\n"
