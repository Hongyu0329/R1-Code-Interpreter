    "An internal adjunction in the simplex category $\\Delta$, when viewed as a locally posetal 2-subcategory of $\\mathsf{Pos}$, is a pair of order-preserving maps $f: [m] \\to [n]$ and $g: [n] \\to [m]$ that form a Galois connection. The objects $[m]$ and $[n]$ are the finite posets $\\{0, 1, \\dots, m\\}$ and $\\{0, 1, \\dots, n\\}$ with their usual ordering. The maps $f$ and $g$ must satisfy the condition $f(i) \\le j \\iff i \\le g(j)$ for all $i \\in [m]$ and $j \\in [n]$. This is equivalent to the conditions $\\mathrm{id}_{[m]} \\le g \\circ f$ and $f \\circ g \\le \\mathrm{id}_{[n]}$.\n\nThe existence of such an adjunction is determined by properties of either the left adjoint map $f$ or the right adjoint map $g$. An order-preserving map $f: [m] \\to [n]$ has a right adjoint $g$ if and only if $f$ preserves all existing suprema (joins). For a map between finite total orders, this simplifies to the condition that $f$ must preserve the minimum element, as the minimum element is the join of the empty set. Therefore, a map $f: [m] \\to [n]$ is a left adjoint if and only if $f(0) = 0$.\n\nSimilarly, an order-preserving map $g: [n] \\to [m]$ has a left adjoint if and only if it preserves all infima (meets), which simplifies to the condition that $g$ must preserve the maximum element, so $g(n)=m$. If one of these conditions holds, the adjoint map is uniquely determined. Thus, the number of adjunctions is the number of possible left-adjoint maps.\n\nThe problem asks for the number of internal adjunctions in $\\Delta$ from $$ to $$. The phrase \"from $$ to $$\" indicates that the left adjoint map is $f: \\to$. Consequently, we need to count the number of order-preserving maps $f: \\to$ that satisfy the condition $f(0) = 0$.\n\nSuch a map is defined by a sequence of values $f(0), f(1), \\dots, f(23)$ satisfying:\n$0 = f(0) \\le f(1) \\le f(2) \\le \\dots \\le f(23) \\le 37$.\n\nSince $f(0)$ is fixed, we need to count the number of non-decreasing sequences of length 23: $f(1), f(2), \\dots, f(23)$, where each element can take any integer value from $0$ to $37$.\nLet $y_i = f(i)$ for $i \\in \\{1, \\dots, 23\\}$. We are counting the number of sequences $(y_1, y_2, \\dots, y_{23})$ such that $0 \\le y_1 \\le y_2 \\le \\dots \\le y_{23} \\le 37$.\n\nThis is a classic combinatorial problem that can be solved using stars and bars. We can establish a bijection between these non-decreasing sequences and the ways to choose 23 numbers from the set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 37\\}$ with replacement. The number of such choices is given by the multiset coefficient formula $\\binom{n+k-1}{k}$, where $k=23$ is the number of items to choose and $n=38$ is the number of available distinct values (from 0 to 37).\nNumber of ways = $\\binom{38+23-1}{23} = \\binom{60}{23}$.\n\nAlternatively, we can map the non-decreasing sequence to a strictly increasing sequence. Let $x_i = y_i + i-1$ for $i=1, \\dots, 23$. This transformation gives a strictly increasing sequence $x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_{23}$ where:\n$0 \\le x_1 < x_2 < \\dots < x_{23}$.\nThe upper bound for $x_{23}$ is $y_{23} + 23 - 1 \\le 37 + 22 = 59$.\nSo we are choosing 23 distinct numbers from the set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 59\\}$, which contains 60 numbers. The number of ways to do this is $\\binom{60}{23}$.\n\nTherefore, the number of internal adjunctions from $$ to $$ in the simplex category $\\Delta$ is $\\binom{60}{23}$.\n\n"
