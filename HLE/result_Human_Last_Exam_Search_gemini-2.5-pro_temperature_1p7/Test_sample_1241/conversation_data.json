    "To find the steady-state probabilities $P_i(+\\infty)$, which we will denote as $P_i$, we need to solve the system of linear equations that arises when the time derivatives in the Kolmogorov-Chapman equations are set to zero, under the constraint that the probabilities sum to 1.\n\nThe provided system of equations is:\n$$\nP_{0}'(t) = -0.019 P_{0}(t) + 0.65 P_{1}(t)\n$$\n$$\nP_{1}'(t) = -0.019 P_{0}(t) - (0.65 + 0.4)P_{1}(t) + 0.392 P_{2}(t) + 0.008 P_{3}(t)\n$$\n$$\nP_{2}'(t) = 0.4 P_{1}(t) - (0.392  + 0.008)P_{2}(t)\n$$\n$$\nP_{3}'(t) = 0.008 P_{2}(t) - 0.008 P_{3}(t)\n$$\n$$\nP_{0}(t) + P_{1}(t) + P_{2}(t) + P_{3}(t) = 1\n$$\n\nIn the context of a Kolmogorov-Chapman system, the rate of change of probability for a state is determined by the balance of flows into and out of that state. The term $\\lambda_{ij}P_i(t)$ represents the flow from state $i$ to state $j$. Therefore, the equation for $P_1'(t)$ should include a positive term for the flow from state 0 to state 1, which is $+\\lambda_{01}P_0(t)$. The provided equation has a negative sign, $-0.019 P_0(t)$, which is likely a typographical error. Assuming the standard formulation, the second equation should be:\n$$\nP_{1}'(t) = +0.019 P_{0}(t) - (0.65 + 0.4)P_{1}(t) + 0.392 P_{2}(t) + 0.008 P_{3}(t)\n$$\nProceeding with this corrected equation, we set the derivatives to zero for the steady state ($t \\to +\\infty$):\n\n1.  $0 = -0.019 P_0 + 0.65 P_1 \\implies 0.019 P_0 = 0.65 P_1$\n2.  $0 = 0.019 P_0 - 1.05 P_1 + 0.392 P_2 + 0.008 P_3$\n3.  $0 = 0.4 P_1 - 0.4 P_2 \\implies 0.4 P_1 = 0.4 P_2$\n4.  $0 = 0.008 P_2 - 0.008 P_3 \\implies 0.008 P_2 = 0.008 P_3$\n5.  $P_0 + P_1 + P_2 + P_3 = 1$\n\nFrom equation (4), we get:\n$P_2 = P_3$\n\nFrom equation (3), we get:\n$P_1 = P_2$\n\nTherefore, we have the relationship:\n$P_1 = P_2 = P_3$\n\nFrom equation (1), we can express $P_0$ in terms of $P_1$:\n$P_0 = \\frac{0.65}{0.019} P_1 = \\frac{650}{19} P_1$\n\nNow, we use the normalization condition (equation 5) to solve for the probabilities. We substitute $P_0$, $P_2$, and $P_3$ with their expressions in terms of $P_1$:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{650}{19} P_1\\right) + P_1 + P_1 + P_1 = 1\n$$\n$$\nP_1 \\left(\\frac{650}{19} + 3\\right) = 1\n$$\n$$\nP_1 \\left(\\frac{650 + 57}{19}\\right) = 1\n$$\n$$\nP_1 \\left(\\frac{707}{19}\\right) = 1\n$$\n$$\nP_1 = \\frac{19}{707}\n$$\nNow we find $P_0$:\n$$\nP_0 = \\frac{650}{19} P_1 = \\frac{650}{19} \\times \\frac{19}{707} = \\frac{650}{707}\n$$\nThe problem asks for the sum $P_0(+\\infty) + P_1(+\\infty)$, which is $P_0 + P_1$:\n$$\nP_0 + P_1 = \\frac{650}{707} + \\frac{19}{707} = \\frac{650 + 19}{707} = \\frac{669}{707}\n$$\nCalculating the numerical value:\n$$\n\\frac{669}{707} \\approx 0.946251768\n$$\n\n<<<669/707>>>"
