    "To determine the number of Configuration State Functions (CSFs) for a full Configuration Interaction (CI) calculation of the molecule `CH₂SiHF` with the `6-31G**` basis set, a multi-step process is required. This involves ascertaining the total number of electrons in the molecule, the total number of basis functions (which corresponds to the number of spatial orbitals), and finally, applying the correct formula to calculate the number of singlet CSFs.\n\n### 1. Total Number of Electrons\n\nFirst, the total number of electrons (Nₑ) in the molecule is calculated by summing the electrons from each constituent atom:\n*   **Carbon (C):** 6 electrons\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** 1 electron per atom (x3) = 3 electrons\n*   **Silicon (Si):** 14 electrons\n*   **Fluorine (F):** 9 electrons\n\nTotal electrons (Nₑ) = 6 + 3 + 14 + 9 = **32 electrons**.\nFor a closed-shell singlet ground state, the number of alpha-spin electrons (Nα) equals the number of beta-spin electrons (Nβ), so Nα = Nβ = 16.\n\n### 2. Total Number of Basis Functions\n\nNext, the number of basis functions (spatial orbitals, K) for each atom with the `6-31G**` basis set must be determined. The `**` notation signifies the addition of polarization functions: d-functions on heavy (non-hydrogen) atoms and p-functions on hydrogen atoms. Standard modern calculations use 5 spherical d-functions and 3 p-functions.\n\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** The `6-31G` part provides 2 basis functions. The `**` adds a set of 3 p-functions, for a total of **5 basis functions**.\n*   **Carbon (C):** As a first-row atom, `6-31G` provides 9 basis functions. The `*` adds a set of 5 d-functions, resulting in **14 basis functions**.\n*   **Fluorine (F):** Similar to Carbon, this first-row atom has 9 basis functions from `6-31G` plus 5 d-functions, totaling **14 basis functions**.\n*   **Silicon (Si):** As a second-row atom, `6-31G` provides 13 basis functions. The `*` adds 5 d-functions, for a total of **18 basis functions**.\n\nThe total number of basis functions (K) for `CH₂SiHF` (composed of 1 C, 3 H, 1 Si, and 1 F) is:\nK = (1 × 14) + (3 × 5) + (1 × 18) + (1 × 14) = 14 + 15 + 18 + 14 = **61 basis functions**.\n\n### 3. Number of Configuration State Functions (CSFs)\n\nA full CI calculation considers all possible arrangements of the electrons within the available orbitals. For a system with Nₑ electrons, K spatial orbitals, and a total spin S=0 (a singlet state), the number of CSFs is given by the Weyl-Paldus formula.\n\nThe formula is:\nNumber of CSFs = (1 / (K + 1)) * C(K + 1, Nₑ/2) * C(K + 1, Nₑ/2 + 1)\n\nWhere C(n, k) is the binomial coefficient \"n choose k\".\n\nPlugging in the values K = 61 and Nₑ = 32 (so Nₑ/2 = 16):\n\n*   Number of CSFs = (1 / (61 + 1)) * C(61 + 1, 16) * C(61 + 1, 16 + 1)\n*   Number of CSFs = (1 / 62) * C(62, 16) * C(62, 17)\n\nCalculating the binomial coefficients:\n*   C(62, 16) = 433,308,018,335,150\n*   C(62, 17) = 1,173,812,239,892,300\n\nFinally, the total number of singlet CSFs is:\n\nNumber of CSFs = (1 / 62) * (433,308,018,335,150) * (1,173,812,239,892,300) ≈ **8.203 x 10²⁷**\n\nThis astronomically large number highlights why full CI calculations are only feasible for very small molecules and basis sets.\n\n<<<8.203 x 10²⁷>>>"
