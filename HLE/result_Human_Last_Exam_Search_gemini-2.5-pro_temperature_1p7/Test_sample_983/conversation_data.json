    "The next number in the sequence is 2358.\n\nThe provided sequence is: 1014, 1020, 1032, 1050, 1104, 1224, 1230, 1290, 1410, 1440, 1452, 1482, 1500, 1512, 1560, 1584, 1602, 1734, 1812, 1890, 1902, 1932, 1974, 2004, 2040, 2064, 2070, 2130, 2142, 2274, 2340, 2352.\n\nA key property of all numbers in the sequence is that they are divisible by 6. This can be verified by checking for divisibility by both 2 (the number is even) and 3 (the sum of the digits is divisible by 3).\n\nTo determine the next number, we analyze the differences between consecutive terms:\n*   1020 - 1014 = 6\n*   1032 - 1020 = 12\n*   1050 - 1032 = 18\n*   ...and so on.\n\nThis initial sequence of differences does not reveal a simple arithmetic pattern. However, a more subtle pattern emerges when looking at specific subsequences of these differences. Let's examine the last few differences in the sequence:\n*   2352 - 2340 = 12\n*   2340 - 2274 = 66\n*   2274 - 2142 = 132\n\nHere, we can observe a pattern of division by 2: 132 / 2 = 66. This `d, d/2` pattern has occurred earlier in the sequence of differences as well (e.g., 48, 24). The difference of 12 follows the pair (132, 66). Applying this pattern forward, the next difference is likely to be 12 / 2 = 6.\n\nTherefore, the next number in the sequence is calculated by adding this next difference to the last term:\n2352 + 6 = 2358.\n\nThe number 2358 is also divisible by 6, which is consistent with the rest of the sequence.\n\n<<<2358>>>"
