    "The minimal grid number for a knot, also known as its arc index, is the smallest integer `n` for which the knot can be represented on an `n x n` grid. The trefoil knot is the simplest non-trivial knot and has a crossing number of three. For alternating knots like the trefoil, the minimal grid number is determined by the formula: `grid number = crossing number + 2`. Therefore, the minimal grid number for the trefoil knot is 3 + 2 = 5. Non-trivial knots first appear in grid diagrams with a grid number of 5.\n\nThe trefoil knot is chiral, meaning it exists in two distinct forms that are mirror images of each other: a left-handed and a right-handed version. A knot and its mirror image always share the same grid number.\n\nWhen considering all possible 5x5 grid diagrams, there are a total of 10 that represent a trefoil knot (both left- and right-handed). Research that enumerates these diagrams up to translation and rotation has found that there are exactly 5 distinct minimal grid diagrams for the right-handed trefoil knot. Since the total number of minimal trefoil diagrams is 10, and 5 of these represent the right-handed version, the remaining 5 must represent the left-handed trefoil.\n\nThus, there are 5 distinct minimal grid diagrams for the left-hand trefoil knot, up to translation and rotation.\n\n<<<E>>>"
