    "Blanche of Lancaster, the first wife of John of Gaunt, died on September 12, 1368. At the time of her death, the precise whereabouts of the poet Geoffrey Chaucer are not definitively known, placing him in an unknown location.\n\nHistorical records indicate that Chaucer was on the European continent during 1_368 on a diplomatic mission for the king. One source suggests that his travels on the king's service \"probably\" took him to France. Another source posits he may have attended the wedding of Lionel of Antwerp to Violante Visconti in Milan, Italy, that same year.\n\nWhile it is certain Chaucer was abroad, no document specifies his exact location in September of 1368. Following the death of Prince Lionel in October 1368, it is believed Chaucer entered the service of John of Gaunt, Blanche's husband. It was in Blanche's honor that Chaucer later composed his first major work, \"The Book of the Duchess\".\n\nGiven the lack of a definitive record for his location on the specific day of Blanche of Lancaster's passing, the correct answer is Unknown.\n\n<<<D>>>"
