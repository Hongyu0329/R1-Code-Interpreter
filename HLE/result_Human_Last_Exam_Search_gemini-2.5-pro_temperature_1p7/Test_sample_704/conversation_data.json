    "Isaac Newton, in his work \"Opticks\" from 1704, created a colour circle where he associated the seven colours of the spectrum with the seven notes of a musical scale. The combination of yellow and blue pigments results in the colour green.\n\nNewton's colour circle follows the order of the visible spectrum: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet. He mapped these colours to the notes of a diatonic scale, specifically the Dorian mode starting on the note D. In this arrangement, the primary colours of red, yellow, and blue correspond to the notes D, F, and A, respectively.\n\nFollowing the musical scale analogy, the colour range between green and blue on Newton's circle is associated with a specific musical note. The sequence of colours and their corresponding notes in the Dorian mode starting on D are as follows:\n\n*   Red - D\n*   Orange - E\n*   Yellow - F\n*   Green - G\n*   Blue - A\n*   Indigo - B\n*   Violet - C\n\nThe colour produced by combining yellow and blue is green. The range between green and blue on Newton's colour circle therefore corresponds to the musical note **G**.\n\n<<<G>>>"
