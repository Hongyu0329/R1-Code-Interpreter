    "To find the central pixel of the line between (1, 1) and (11, 5) using Bresenham's line algorithm, we first need to determine all the pixels that form the line.\n\nThe Bresenham's line algorithm is an efficient way to draw a line on a grid of pixels. For the given coordinates, the algorithm proceeds as follows:\n\n*   **Initialization:**\n    *   The starting point is (1, 1).\n    *   The change in x (dx) is 11 - 1 = 10.\n    *   The change in y (dy) is 5 - 1 = 4.\n    *   The initial decision parameter is calculated as 2 * dy - dx = 2 * 4 - 10 = -2.\n\n*   **Iteration:**\n    The algorithm iterates, at each step incrementing the x-coordinate and deciding whether to increment the y-coordinate based on the decision parameter. This process generates the following sequence of pixels:\n    (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 2), (4, 2), (5, 3), (6, 3), (7, 3), (8, 4), (9, 4), (10, 5), (11, 5)\n\n*   **Central Pixel:**\n    The generated line consists of 11 pixels. The central pixel is the 6th one in this sequence.\n\nTherefore, the coordinates of the central pixel are (6, 3).\n\n<<<**(6, 3)>>>"
