    "The computational time complexity of the provided algorithm depends on two main factors: the number of iterations of the `while` loop and the complexity of the operations performed within each iteration.\n\n**1. Number of Loop Iterations:**\n\nThe `while` loop continues as long as the variable `q` is greater than 0. The value of `q` is determined by `⌊x/c⌋`. In each iteration, `x` takes the value of the previous `q`. This process is equivalent to repeatedly dividing the original number `n` by the base `c`.\n\nLet's trace the value of `x` at the beginning of each iteration:\n*   Before loop: `x = n`\n*   Start of iteration 1: `x = ⌊n/c⌋`\n*   Start of iteration 2: `x = ⌊(⌊n/c⌋)/c⌋ = ⌊n/c²⌋`\n*   Start of iteration `k`: `x = ⌊n/c^k⌋`\n\nThe loop terminates when `q = ⌊x/c⌋` becomes 0, which happens when `x` is less than `c`. This occurs when `n/c^k < 1`, or `n < c^k`. Taking the logarithm to the base `c` of both sides gives `log_c(n) < k`. Therefore, the number of iterations is proportional to `log_c(n)`. The number of digits in the base `c` representation of `n` is `⌊log_c(n)⌋ + 1`, and the loop runs one less time than the number of digits.\n\nSo, the number of iterations is O(log_c(n)), which is equivalent to O(log n).\n\n**2. Complexity of Operations Inside the Loop:**\n\nThe operations inside the loop are:\n*   `i := i + 1` (increment)\n*   `x := q` (assignment)\n*   `q := ⌊x/c⌋` (integer division)\n*   `a_i := x — qc` (multiplication and subtraction)\n\nIn a typical analysis (the \"unit cost\" model), these basic arithmetic operations (division, multiplication, subtraction) on numbers that fit within a machine's word size are considered to take constant time, or O(1).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe total time complexity is the product of the number of iterations and the complexity of the work done in each iteration.\n\nTotal Complexity = (Number of Iterations) × (Complexity per Iteration)\nTotal Complexity = O(log_c n) × O(1)\nTotal Complexity = O(log_c n)\n\nBy the change of base rule for logarithms, `log_c(n)` is proportional to `log(n)`, so the complexity is commonly expressed as O(log n). The described algorithm of repeated integer division to get each digit is a standard method for base conversion.\n\nIf we consider a more detailed \"bit cost\" model where `n` can be arbitrarily large, the cost of division and multiplication of an `m`-bit number by a fixed-size number `c` would be O(m). Since the number of bits in `x` is initially `log_2(n)` and decreases in each step, a more precise analysis would yield a different result, but for a standard algorithmic analysis assuming O(1) arithmetic, O(log n) is the correct answer.\n\n<<<O(log n)>>>"
