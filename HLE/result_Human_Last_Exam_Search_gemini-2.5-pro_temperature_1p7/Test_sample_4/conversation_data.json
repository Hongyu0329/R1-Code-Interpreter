    "The Poincaré polynomial of a Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$ is the generating function for the dimensions of its homology (or cohomology) groups, given by $P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\dim \\mathfrak{g}} b_k x^k$, where $b_k = \\dim H_k(\\mathfrak{g})$ are the Betti numbers.\n\nThe given 6-dimensional real Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$ has the following non-zero commutation relations:\n$[e_1, e_2] = e_3$\n$[e_1, e_3] = e_4$\n$[e_1, e_5] = e_6$\n\nThis Lie algebra is nilpotent. To compute its Poincaré polynomial, we can analyze its structure. The center of the Lie algebra, $Z(\\mathfrak{g})$, consists of elements that commute with all other elements. In this case, the center is the two-dimensional abelian ideal spanned by $e_4$ and $e_6$: $Z(\\mathfrak{g}) = \\text{span}\\{e_4, e_6\\} \\cong \\mathbb{R}^2$.\n\nWe can consider the central extension of Lie algebras:\n$0 \\to Z(\\mathfrak{g}) \\to \\mathfrak{g} \\to \\mathfrak{g}/Z(\\mathfrak{g}) \\to 0$\n\nFor a central extension, the Hochschild-Serre spectral sequence degenerates at the $E_2$-page. This implies that the Poincaré polynomial of $\\mathfrak{g}$ is the product of the Poincaré polynomials of the ideal $Z(\\mathfrak{g})$ and the quotient algebra $\\mathfrak{g}/Z(\\mathfrak{g})$.\n\nFirst, we compute the Poincaré polynomial for the center $Z(\\mathfrak{g}) \\cong \\mathbb{R}^2$. For an $n$-dimensional abelian Lie algebra, the differential in the Chevalley-Eilenberg complex is zero, so the homology is isomorphic to the exterior algebra itself. The Poincaré polynomial for $\\mathbb{R}^n$ is $(1+x)^n$. Thus, for $Z(\\mathfrak{g})$:\n$P_{Z(\\mathfrak{g})}(x) = (1+x)^2 = 1 + 2x + x^2$.\n\nNext, we analyze the structure of the quotient algebra $\\bar{\\mathfrak{g}} = \\mathfrak{g}/Z(\\mathfrak{g})$. This is a 4-dimensional Lie algebra with basis elements $\\bar{e}_1, \\bar{e}_2, \\bar{e}_3, \\bar{e}_5$. The commutation relations are:\n$[\\bar{e}_1, \\bar{e}_2] = \\bar{e}_3$\n$[\\bar{e}_1, \\bar{e}_3] = \\overline{[e_1, e_3]} = \\bar{e}_4 = 0$\n$[\\bar{e}_1, \\bar{e}_5] = \\overline{[e_1, e_5]} = \\bar{e}_6 = 0$\nAll other brackets are zero. The element $\\bar{e}_5$ commutes with all other basis elements, so it forms a one-dimensional central ideal in $\\bar{\\mathfrak{g}}$. The remaining part, spanned by $\\{\\bar{e}_1, \\bar{e}_2, \\bar{e}_3\\}$, is isomorphic to the 3-dimensional Heisenberg Lie algebra, $\\mathfrak{h}_3$. Therefore, the quotient algebra is a direct sum: $\\bar{\\mathfrak{g}} \\cong \\mathfrak{h}_3 \\oplus \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nThe Poincaré polynomial of a direct sum of Lie algebras is the product of their individual Poincaré polynomials.\nThe polynomial for $\\mathbb{R}$ is $P_{\\mathbb{R}}(x) = 1+x$.\nThe polynomial for the Heisenberg algebra $\\mathfrak{h}_3$ (with relations $[x,y]=z$) is known to be $P_{\\mathfrak{h}_3}(x) = 1+2x+2x^2+x^3$.\nThus, the Poincaré polynomial for the quotient algebra is:\n$P_{\\bar{\\mathfrak{g}}}(x) = P_{\\mathfrak{h}_3}(x) \\cdot P_{\\mathbb{R}}(x) = (1+2x+2x^2+x^3)(1+x) = 1 + 3x + 4x^2 + 3x^3 + x^4$.\n\nFinally, we find the Poincaré polynomial of the original algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$ by multiplying the polynomials of its components in the central extension:\n$P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = P_{\\bar{\\mathfrak{g}}}(x) \\cdot P_{Z(\\mathfrak{g})}(x)$\n$P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = (1 + 3x + 4x^2 + 3x^3 + x^4) \\cdot (1 + 2x + x^2)$\n$P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = 1(1 + 3x + 4x^2 + 3x^3 + x^4) + 2x(1 + 3x + 4x^2 + 3x^3 + x^4) + x^2(1 + 3x + 4x^2 + 3x^3 + x^4)$\n$P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = (1 + 3x + 4x^2 + 3x^3 + x^4) + (2x + 6x^2 + 8x^3 + 6x^4 + 2x^5) + (x^2 + 3x^3 + 4x^4 + 3x^5 + x^6)$\n$P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = 1 + (3+2)x + (4+6+1)x^2 + (3+8+3)x^3 + (1+6+4)x^4 + (2+3)x^5 + x^6$\n$P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = 1 + 5x + 11x^2 + 14x^3 + 11x^4 + 5x^5 + x^6$.\n\n<<<1 + 5x + 11x^2 + 14x^3 + 11x^4 + 5x^5 + x^6>>>"
