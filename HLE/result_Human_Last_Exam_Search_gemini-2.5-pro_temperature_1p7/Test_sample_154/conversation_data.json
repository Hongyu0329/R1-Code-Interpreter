    "There are 11 simple non-isomorphic 2-vertex-connected graphs with 5 vertices.\n\nA simple graph is a graph without loops or multiple edges between the same two vertices. Two graphs are non-isomorphic if they cannot be made structurally identical by relabeling their vertices. A graph is 2-vertex-connected if it has more than two vertices and remains connected even after removing any single vertex. Such a graph does not have any \"cut vertices\" or \"articulation points\".\n\nOf the 34 non-isomorphic graphs with 5 vertices, 21 are connected. The remaining 13 are disconnected and therefore not 2-vertex-connected. By analyzing each of the 21 connected graphs, we can determine which ones lack a cut vertex.\n\nThe 2-vertex-connected graphs with 5 vertices are:\n\n*   **1 graph with 5 edges:**\n    *   The cycle graph on 5 vertices (C5).\n\n*   **3 graphs with 6 edges:**\n    *   The cycle graph on 5 vertices with one chord (C5 with an added edge).\n    *   The \"house\" graph (a square with a triangle on top).\n    *   The complete bipartite graph K(2,3).\n\n*   **3 graphs with 7 edges:**\n    *   The \"fish\" graph, which is a cycle on 5 vertices with two chords originating from the same vertex.\n    *   A cycle on 5 vertices with two non-crossing chords.\n    *   The \"fan\" graph, where one central vertex is connected to the other four vertices which form a path.\n\n*   **2 graphs with 8 edges:**\n    *   The wheel graph on 5 vertices (W5), which is a cycle on 4 vertices with a central vertex connected to all of them. This is also the complete graph K5 with two incident edges removed.\n    *   The complete graph K5 with two non-incident edges removed.\n\n*   **1 graph with 9 edges:**\n    *   The complete graph K5 with one edge removed.\n\n*   **1 graph with 10 edges:**\n    *   The complete graph on 5 vertices (K5).\n\nIn total, there are 1 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 11 such graphs.\n\n<<<11>>>"
