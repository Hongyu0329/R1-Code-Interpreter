    "The largest French ship by displacement to be sunk by a U-boat before the 1940 armistice was the steam merchant **Bretagne**.\n\nThe *Bretagne*, a vessel of the Compagnie Générale Transatlantique, was sunk on October 14, 1939, by the German submarine U-45. The ship had a gross register tonnage (GRT) of 10,108 tons, making it the most significant French loss to a U-boat in the specified period based on available tonnage data. While the exact displacement is not specified in the search results, GRT is a standard measure of a ship's size.\n\nThe sinking occurred when the U-45 attacked the unescorted convoy KJF-3, approximately 230 miles southwest of Fastnet. The *Bretagne* was on a voyage from Cristobal, via Kingston, Jamaica, to Le Havre, carrying general cargo. The attack resulted in the death of seven crew members.\n\nIt is important not to confuse this merchant ship with the French battleship *Bretagne*. The battleship, which had a standard displacement of 23,936 tonnes, was sunk on July 3, 1940, after the armistice, by British naval forces at Mers-el-Kébir, not by a U-boat. Other French vessels, such as submarines, were also sunk by U-boats during this time, but they were of a much smaller tonnage. For example, submarines of the *Redoutable*-class had a surfaced displacement of 1,572 tonnes.\n\n<<<Bretagne (steam merchant)>>>"
