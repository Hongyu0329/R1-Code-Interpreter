    "Yes, there is an upper bound on the cardinality of $X$. The upper bound is the cardinality of the continuum, denoted by $c$, which is equal to $2^{\\aleph_0}$.\n\nThis conclusion is based on the following mathematical arguments:\n1.  **A connected metric space is separable.** A key theorem in topology states that any connected metric space possesses a countable dense subset. A space with this property is called \"separable\".\n2.  **A separable metric space has a cardinality of at most $c$.** If a metric space is separable, it contains a countable dense subset. This property limits the space's \"size\". Every point in the space can be uniquely identified by its distances from the points in the countable dense subset. This allows for an injective (one-to-one) mapping from the space $X$ into the set of real-valued sequences indexed by the countable dense set, which has cardinality $c^{\\aleph_0} = c$. A more common proof shows that a separable metric space is second-countable, and a second-countable Hausdorff space has cardinality at most $c$.\n3.  **The properties of U are consistent with this bound.** The condition that $X$ has a dense open subset $U$ where each point has a neighborhood homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}$ (a 1-dimensional manifold) ensures that the space $X$ is non-trivial and reinforces the properties that lead to the cardinality bound.\n    *   Since $X$ is a separable space, and $U$ is an open subset, $U$ is also separable.\n    *   $U$ is a separable manifold, which implies its cardinality is at most $c$.\n    *   Because $X$ is a metric space and $U$ is dense in it, every point in $X$ is the limit of a sequence of points from $U$. This means the cardinality of $X$ is no more than the number of sequences that can be formed from points in $U$, which is $|U|^{\\aleph_0}$.\n    *   Therefore, $|X| \\leq c^{\\aleph_0} = (2^{\\aleph_0})^{\\aleph_0} = 2^{\\aleph_0 \\cdot \\aleph_0} = 2^{\\aleph_0} = c$.\n\nBoth lines of reasoning establish that the cardinality of $X$ cannot exceed the cardinality of the continuum.\n\n**This bound is sharp**, meaning it can be achieved. For example, the real line, $\\mathbb{R}$, is a connected metric space. Its cardinality is $c$. The set $U = \\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\{0\\}$ is a dense open subset of $\\mathbb{R}$, and every point in $U$ has a neighborhood homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\n<<<Yes, the cardinality of the continuum, $c=2^{\\aleph_0}$."
