    "To evaluate the integral, we first analyze the integrand `F₃'(x)/F₃(x)`. This is a standard integral form.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Integral\n\nThe integral of `f'(x)/f(x)` with respect to `x` is `ln|f(x)| + C`. In this problem, the integrand is `F₃'(x)/F₃(x)`, so its antiderivative is `ln|F₃(x)|`.\n\nUsing the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, the definite integral from 0 to 1 is:\n`V = [ln|F₃(x)|] from 0 to 1 = ln|F₃(1)| - ln|F₃(0)|`\n\n### Step 2: Calculate F₃(0)\n\nWe evaluate the sequence of functions at `x = 0`:\n*   `F₀(0) = 0`\n*   `F₁(0) = sin(F₀(0)) = sin(0) = 0`\n*   `F₂(0) = e^(F₁(0)) = e⁰ = 1`\n*   `F₃(0) = ln(1 + F₂(0)) = ln(1 + 1) = ln(2)`\n\n### Step 3: Calculate F₃(1)\n\nNext, we evaluate the sequence of functions at `x = 1`. In calculus, trigonometric functions are evaluated in radians.\n*   `F₀(1) = 1`\n*   `F₁(1) = sin(F₀(1)) = sin(1)`\n*   `F₂(1) = e^(F₁(1)) = e^(sin(1))`\n*   `F₃(1) = ln(1 + F₂(1)) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))`\n\n### Step 4: Evaluate the Definite Integral V\n\nNow, we substitute the values of `F₃(1)` and `F₃(0)` back into the expression for `V`.\n`V = ln|ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))| - ln|ln(2)|`\n\nSince `sin(1)` is positive (sin(x) is positive for x between 0 and π ≈ 3.14), `e^(sin(1))` is greater than 1. Therefore, `1 + e^(sin(1))` is greater than 2, and `ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))` is greater than `ln(2)`. As `ln(2)` is positive, both `F₃(1)` and `F₃(0)` are positive, so the absolute value signs can be removed.\n\n`V = ln(ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))) - ln(ln(2))`\n\nUsing the logarithm property `ln(a) - ln(b) = ln(a/b)`, we get:\n`V = ln( ln(1 + e^(sin(1))) / ln(2) )`\n\n### Step 5: Numerical Calculation\n\nTo find the final answer, we compute the numerical value of V.\n*   The value of `sin(1)` in radians is approximately 0.84147.\n*   The value of `ln(2)` is approximately 0.693147.\n\nLet's compute the components:\n*   `e^(sin(1)) ≈ e^0.84147 ≈ 2.32012`\n*   `1 + e^(sin(1)) ≈ 3.32012`\n*   `F₃(1) = ln(3.32012) ≈ 1.2000`\n*   `F₃(0) = ln(2) ≈ 0.69315`\n\nNow, substitute these into the expression for V:\n`V ≈ ln(1.2000 / 0.69315) ≈ ln(1.73129) ≈ 0.54886`\n\nThe problem asks for the closest integer to `10000 * V`:\n`10000 * V ≈ 10000 * 0.54886 = 5488.6`\n\nThe closest integer to 5488.6 is 5489.\n\n<<<5489>>>"
