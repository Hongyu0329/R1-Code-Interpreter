    "In an interacting scalar field theory, the number of loops, vertices, and lines in a Feynman diagram are related by a topological formula. The most common type of self-interacting scalar field theory is the φ⁴ theory, where each interaction vertex connects four lines.\n\nTo determine the minimum number of vertices for a two-loop diagram, we can consider the relationship L = I - V + 1, where L is the number of loops, I is the number of internal lines (propagators), and V is the number of vertices. We are given L=2.\n\nFor a φ⁴ theory, the total number of lines meeting at vertices is 4V. This must equal the sum of twice the number of internal lines and the number of external lines (E), so 4V = 2I + E.\n\nLet's test for the smallest possible number of vertices, V=1:\nIf V=1, the loop formula gives 2 = I - 1 + 1, which means I = 2.\nUsing this in the second formula: 4 * 1 = 2 * 2 + E, which simplifies to 4 = 4 + E, meaning E = 0.\n\nThis corresponds to a vacuum diagram (a diagram with no external lines). It is possible to construct such a diagram with one vertex and two internal lines. This is known as the \"figure-eight\" or \"double-scoop\" diagram, where two pairs of lines from the single four-point vertex are connected to form two loops. This is a valid two-loop diagram.\n\nIf we were to require the diagram to have external lines (for example, to represent a particle scattering or a propagator correction), the minimum number of vertices would be two. This corresponds to the \"setting-sun\" diagram, which has two vertices, three internal lines, and two external lines. However, the question asks for the absolute minimum without such restrictions.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of vertices in a two-loop Feynman diagram for an interacting scalar field theory is one.\n\n<<<1>>>"
