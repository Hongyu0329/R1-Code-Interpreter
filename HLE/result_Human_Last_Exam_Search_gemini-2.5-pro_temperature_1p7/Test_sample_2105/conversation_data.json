    "I am unable to provide a numerical answer to your question.\n\nThe major reduction product of di(perylene-3-yl) disulfide is **perylene-3-thiol**. I have successfully determined its chemical structure.\n\nHowever, the core of your question involves the calculation of the Szeged and Wiener topological indices for this molecule, with the explicit and non-standard requirement of including all hydrogen atoms in the calculation. This level of specific computational chemistry is beyond the scope of my available tools. While I can identify software that might perform this calculation, I cannot operate it. Extensive searches for pre-calculated values for this specific molecule under these precise conditions have not yielded any results, as calculations are overwhelmingly performed on hydrogen-suppressed graphs.\n\nTherefore, a definitive numerical value for the Szeged/Wiener index ratio cannot be provided.\n\n<<<I am unable to provide an answer.>>>"
