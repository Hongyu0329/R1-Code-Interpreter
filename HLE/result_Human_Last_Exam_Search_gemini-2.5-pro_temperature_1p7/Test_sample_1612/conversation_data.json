    "In Major League Baseball (MLB), there are two types of Triple Crowns a player can win: one for batting and one for pitching. The number of winners for each is distinct, and the recent inclusion of Negro Leagues statistics into MLB's official records has expanded the list of honorees.\n\nIn the history of MLB, a total of 27 players have won the batting Triple Crown, which is achieved by leading the league in batting average, home runs, and runs batted in (RBIs). Some sources may cite slightly different numbers due to ongoing historical statistical reviews. This prestigious list includes players from the American League, National League, and the Negro Leagues. Of these winners, four players have accomplished the feat more than once: Oscar Charleston (3 times), Rogers Hornsby (2 times), Ted Williams (2 times), and Josh Gibson (2 times). The most recent batter to win the Triple Crown was Miguel Cabrera in 2012.\n\nFor pitchers, the Triple Crown is awarded to the player who leads the league in wins, strikeouts, and earned run average (ERA). There have been 38 pitchers who have won the pitching Triple Crown. The feat has been accomplished more frequently than its batting counterpart. Several pitchers have won the award multiple times, including Grover Cleveland Alexander, Walter Johnson, Sandy Koufax, Christy Mathewson, Lefty Grove, Lefty Gomez, and Roger Clemens.\n\n<<<There are 27 batting Triple Crown winners and 38 pitching Triple Crown winners in MLB history.>>>"
