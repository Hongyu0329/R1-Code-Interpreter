    "Following the rules of the one-dimensional cellular automaton Rule 110, starting with a single cell in state 1 (represented as a \"black\" cell) and applying the rule for 20 iterations, results in a specific binary pattern.\n\nRule 110 dictates the state of a cell in the next generation based on its own state and the state of its two immediate neighbors. The rule, in binary `01101110`, translates to the following state transitions:\n\n| Current Pattern | New State for Center Cell |\n|---|---|\n| 111 | 0 |\n| 110 | 1 |\n| 101 | 1 |\n| 100 | 0 |\n| 011 | 1 |\n| 010 | 1 |\n| 001 | 1 |\n| 000 | 0 |\n\nBeginning with an initial state of a single '1' on a background of '0's, each subsequent line is generated by applying these rules to the line above it.\n\nHere is the evolution of the pattern for the first few steps:\n\n*   **Generation 0:** `...0001000...`\n*   **Generation 1:** `...0011000...`\n*   **Generation 2:** `...0110100...`\n*   **Generation 3:** `...1101110...`\n\nAfter 20 applications of the rule, the following binary pattern is generated:\n\n`11011101110011011101`\n\n<<<11011101110011011101>>>"
