    "In Andrei Tarkovsky's 1972 film *Solaris*, it is the character of **Dr. Snaut** who is ashamed to miss the sound of rustling leaves on Earth.\n\nThis is demonstrated in a scene where Snaut shows the newly arrived psychologist, Kris Kelvin, how to create a sound reminiscent of Earth's nature within the sterile environment of the space station. He suggests hanging strips of paper on an air vent, explaining that the sound of the paper flapping in the artificial breeze is similar to the rustling of leaves.\n\nOne analysis of the film further details that Snaut admits to Kelvin that Dr. Sartorius makes fun of him for this practice, though Sartorius himself also has paper strips hanging in his own quarters. This indicates Snaut's self-consciousness and a sense of shame about his profound homesickness and his attempt to replicate a simple, natural sound from his home planet. The theme of shame is also explicitly mentioned by Kris Kelvin in the film when he says, \"Shame, the feeling that will save mankind.\"\n\n<<<C>>>"
