    "After a gene is duplicated, creating a redundant copy, several evolutionary paths are possible. The mechanisms responsible for both retaining the two copies and their subsequent divergence are central to understanding genomic evolution. Here is a breakdown of the given options:\n\n*   **A. Gene conversion:** This is a process where one DNA sequence replaces another homologous sequence, such as a duplicated gene. This mechanism tends to *homogenize* the two copies, making them more similar. Therefore, it actively works *against* their divergence, although it can influence their joint evolution.\n*   **B. Pseudogenization:** This is the most common fate for a duplicated gene, where one copy accumulates mutations and becomes non-functional. Since this process involves the *loss* of a functional gene, it does not explain the retention and divergence of *two* functional genes.\n*   **C. Neofunctionalization:** In this process, one copy of the duplicated gene retains the original function, while the other copy accumulates mutations that give it a completely new function. This is a major pathway for evolutionary innovation and explains both the retention of the two copies (as they are no longer redundant) and their divergence.\n*   **D. Subfunctionalization:** This model proposes that an ancestral gene had multiple functions (subfunctions). After duplication, each copy loses different subfunctions through mutation, such that both copies become necessary to perform all the functions of the original ancestral gene. This partitioning of functions, also known as the Duplication-Degeneration-Complementation (DDC) model, provides a strong selective pressure to retain both copies and leads to their divergence.\n*   **E. Adaptive radiation:** This is a macroevolutionary concept describing the rapid diversification of species from a common ancestor to fill different ecological niches. While gene duplication can provide the genetic raw material that facilitates adaptive radiation, it is not a direct molecular mechanism for the retention and divergence of individual genes.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBoth neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization are widely accepted mechanisms for the retention and divergence of duplicate genes. However, subfunctionalization is often considered a more likely initial step for preserving duplicate genes from being lost to pseudogenization. It relies on common, degenerative mutations that partition existing functions, which provides an immediate reason to keep both copies. Neofunctionalization, requiring a rarer gain-of-function mutation, can follow. Some models even suggest subfunctionalization acts as a transitional state that allows for the preservation of genes that later neofunctionalize. Given its role as a more passive and potentially more common route for the initial preservation of both copies, subfunctionalization is the most likely mechanism.\n\n<<<D>>>"
