To achieve the lowest energy consumption while maintaining a Packet Error Rate (PER) not exceeding 1%, the network server should assign the lowest possible Spreading Factor (SF) that allows for a reliable connection, and then the lowest possible transmit power for that SF. In a typical urban environment, this would be **SF7**. The optimal transmission power would be the lowest level that ensures the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) at the gateway remains consistently above the threshold required for a 1% PER with SF7 (approximately -7.5 dB), which would be determined by the Adaptive Data Rate (ADR) mechanism based on the link performance. Assuming a favorable link budget, the optimal transmit power would be at the lower end of the available range, such as **2 dBm to 8 dBm**. Without knowing the specific path loss, the most energy-efficient setting is conceptually SF7 at the minimum required transmit power.
