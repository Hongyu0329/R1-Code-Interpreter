    "The user is asking for the number of continuous functions $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ that satisfy the equation $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the properties of such a function $f$.\n\n1.  **Injectivity:** If $f(x_1) = f(x_2)$, then $f(f(x_1)) = f(f(x_2))$, which means $\\exp(x_1) = \\exp(x_2)$. Since $\\exp(x)$ is an injective function, this implies $x_1 = x_2$. Therefore, $f$ must be an injective function.\n\n2.  **Continuity and Monotonicity:** A continuous and injective function from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$ must be strictly monotonic. So, $f$ is either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing.\n\n3.  **Monotonicity of f(f(x)):** If $f$ is strictly increasing, then $f(f(x))$ is also strictly increasing. If $f$ is strictly decreasing, then $f(f(x))$ is also strictly increasing. In our case, $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$ is a strictly increasing function, which is consistent with $f$ being monotonic.\n\n4.  **Range of f:** The range of $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$ is $(0, \\infty)$. Let the range of $f$ be $I$. Then the range of $f(f(x))$ is $f(I)$. So, $f(I) = (0, \\infty)$. Since $f$ is continuous, the interval $I$ must be mapped to the interval $(0, \\infty)$. This means the range of $f$ is a subset of the domain of the outer $f$. Also, since the final output is always positive, the values taken by the inner $f(x)$ must be in the domain of the outer $f$. The range of $f$ must be contained in the set of numbers that $f$ can take as input, which is all of $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\nLet's consider the case where $f$ is strictly increasing.\nIf $x > 0$, then $\\exp(x) > 1$. If $x < 0$, then $0 < \\exp(x) < 1$. Also $\\exp(0) = 1$.\nSo we have $f(f(0))=1$.\nIf $f(x) > x$ for some x, then $f(f(x)) > f(x) > x$.\nIf $f(x) < x$ for some x, then $f(f(x)) < f(x) < x$.\nIf $f(x) = x$ for some x, then $f(f(x)) = x$. But $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$, so we would need $\\exp(x)=x$. This equation has no real solutions. Therefore $f(x)$ can never be equal to $x$.\n\nSo either $f(x) > x$ for all $x$ or $f(x) < x$ for all $x$.\nIf $f(x) > x$, then $f(f(x)) > x$. This is consistent with $\\exp(x) > x$ for all $x$.\nIf $f(x) < x$, then $f(f(x)) < x$. But $\\exp(x) > x$ is not always true, for instance $\\exp(-1) = 1/e > -1$. This reasoning is flawed. Let's reconsider.\n\nA key point from one of the search results is that for any continuous function $g$, if we can find an interval where $g(x) > x$ (or $g(x) < x$), we can construct solutions. In our case, $g(x) = \\exp(x)$. Since $\\exp(x) > x$ for all real $x$, this condition is always satisfied.\n\nLet's assume such a function $f$ exists. It is strictly increasing.\nLet $x_0$ be any real number. Define a sequence $x_{n+1} = f(x_n)$ for $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\nThen $x_{n+2} = f(x_{n+1}) = f(f(x_n)) = \\exp(x_n)$.\nLet's analyze the behavior of $f$. Since $\\exp(x)$ has no fixed points, $f$ can't have any fixed points either. Because if $f(a)=a$, then $f(f(a))=a$, but $f(f(a))=\\exp(a)$, so $\\exp(a)=a$, which is impossible.\nSo, either $f(x) > x$ for all $x$ or $f(x) < x$ for all $x$.\nLet's check. If $f(x) < x$ for all $x$, then $f(f(x)) < f(x) < x$. But we need $f(f(x))=\\exp(x)$. So we would need $\\exp(x) < x$ for all $x$. This is false (e.g., $x=1$). So we must have $f(x) > x$ for all $x$.\n\nThe existence of such functions has been a topic of interest in mathematics. For the equation $f(f(x)) = g(x)$, if $g(x) > x$ for all $x$, there are infinitely many continuous solutions for $f(x)$.\n\nThe construction of a solution is non-trivial. It involves defining $f$ on an interval $[x_0, f(x_0)]$ and then extending it to the whole real line using the relation $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$.\nLet's pick an arbitrary $a > 0$. Let $f(0) = a$. Then $f(a) = f(f(0)) = \\exp(0) = 1$.\nNow we need to define $f$ on $[0, a]$ such that:\n*   $f$ is strictly increasing.\n*   $f(0) = a$\n*   $f(a) = 1$\nThis requires $a < 1$. So we must choose $a \\in (0, 1)$.\n\nLet's fix some $a \\in (0,1)$ and try to define $f$ on $[0,a]$. Let $h: [0, a] \\to [a, 1]$ be any strictly increasing continuous function such that $h(0)=a$ and $h(a)=1$. We can define $f(x) = h(x)$ for $x \\in [0, a]$.\nThen for $x \\in [a, 1]$, we can define $f(x) = \\exp(h^{-1}(x))$. This is well-defined because $h$ is a bijection from $[0,a]$ to $[a,1]$.\nThen for $x \\in [1, \\exp(a)]$, we define $f(x) = \\exp(h(\\exp^{-1}(x)))$.\n\nLet's define the sequences $x_{n+1} = \\exp(x_n)$ starting from $x_0=0$, we get $0, 1, e, e^e, \\dots$.\nLet's define $x_{n-1} = \\ln(x_n)$, starting from $x_0=0$, we have $x_{-1} = \\ln(0)$ which is undefined. This suggests that the range of $f$ has to be a subset of $(0, \\infty)$, which in turn implies the domain of the outer $f$ must be a subset of $(0, \\infty)$, but $f$ is defined on $\\mathbb{R}$. The range of $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$ is $(0, \\infty)$, so the range of $f$ must be $(0, \\infty)$. Therefore $f(x) > 0$ for all $x$.\n\nLet's choose an arbitrary continuous, strictly increasing function $\\phi_0: \\to [1, \\exp(0.5)]$ such that $\\phi_0(0) = 1$ and $\\phi_0(1) = \\exp(0.5)$. We can define $f$ on $$ to be $\\phi_0$.\nThen we define $f$ on $[1, \\exp(0.5)]$ as $f(x) = \\exp(\\phi_0^{-1}(x))$.\nThis process can be continued to define $f$ for all non-negative numbers. We can do a similar thing for negative numbers.\n\nThe number of such functions depends on the initial choice of a \"seed\" function on a specific interval.\nFor instance, for any number $a_0 \\in \\mathbb{R}$, we can define the sequence $a_{n+1} = \\exp(a_n)$ for $n \\ge 0$, and $a_{n-1} = \\ln(a_n)$ for $n \\le 0$, provided $a_0 > 0$ to go backwards.\nLet's take a starting point, for example, the interval $$. We know that $f(f(0)) = 1$ and $f(f(1)) = e$.\nLet $f(0) = c$. Since $f$ is strictly increasing, $f(x) > c$ for $x > 0$. Then $f(c) = f(f(0)) = 1$.\nAnd $f(1) > f(0)=c$, so $f(f(1)) > f(c)=1$. Indeed, $e > 1$.\nWe need to choose a value for $c = f(0)$.\nLet's define $f$ on an interval of the form $[x, f(x)]$.\nThe key seems to be that we can choose an arbitrary strictly increasing continuous function on an interval $[a, \\exp(a)]$ to define $f$ between $\\exp(a)$ and $\\exp(\\exp(a))$.\n\nThe set of continuous functions from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$ has the cardinality of the continuum, $c = 2^{\\aleph_0}$.\nWe need to determine if the set of solutions is finite, countably infinite, or has the cardinality of the continuum.\nLet's consider the choices we can make. We can choose an arbitrary value for $f(0)$, let's say $f(0)=a$. Then $f(a) = f(f(0)) = \\exp(0) = 1$. And $f(1)=f(f(a)) = \\exp(a)$. And $f(\\exp(a)) = f(f(1)) = \\exp(1)=e$.\nSince $f$ must be strictly increasing, $x_1 < x_2 \\implies f(x_1) < f(x_2)$.\n$0 < a \\implies f(0) < f(a) \\implies a < 1$.\nSo, we can choose any $a \\in (0,1)$ for the value of $f(0)$.\nLet's fix one such $a$. Now we define $f$ on $[0, a]$ as a strictly increasing continuous function from $a$ to $1$. There are infinitely many such functions. In fact, for any two such distinct functions, say $h_1$ and $h_2$, on $[0, a]$, they will generate different solutions $f_1$ and $f_2$ for $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$.\nThe set of continuous, strictly increasing functions from $[0, a]$ to $[a, 1]$ has the cardinality of the continuum. We can see this by noting that for any sequence of points $x_n$ in $(0, a)$, we can choose a corresponding sequence of values $y_n$ in $(a, 1)$ such that the resulting function is monotonic, and there are $c$ ways to choose such a sequence.\n\nLet's be more precise. Let $h_1, h_2: [0, a] \\to [a, 1]$ be two distinct continuous increasing bijections. Let $f_1, f_2$ be the corresponding solutions to $f(f(x))=\\exp(x)$. If we set $f_1(x) = h_1(x)$ for $x \\in [0, a]$ and $f_2(x) = h_2(x)$ for $x \\in [0, a]$. Since $h_1 \\ne h_2$, there is some $x_0 \\in (0,a)$ where $h_1(x_0) \\ne h_2(x_0)$. So $f_1(x_0) \\ne f_2(x_0)$. Thus, $f_1$ and $f_2$ are different functions.\nThe cardinality of the set of such \"seed\" functions $h$ is the cardinality of the continuum, $c = |\\mathbb{R}|$.\nA continuous function on an interval is determined by its values on a dense subset, like the rationals. So the cardinality of continuous functions on $$ is $|\\mathbb{R}^{\\mathbb{Q}}|= (2^{\\aleph_0})^{\\aleph_0} = 2^{\\aleph_0 \\cdot \\aleph_0} = 2^{\\aleph_0} = c$.\nThe set of strictly increasing continuous functions from $[0,a]$ to $[a,1]$ also has cardinality $c$.\nLet $C$ be the set of continuous functions from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$. We know that $|C| = c$.\nLet $S$ be the set of solutions to $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$.\nWe have established that for each choice of a strictly increasing continuous function $h$ from $[0, a]$ to $[a, 1]$ (where $a$ is a chosen number in $(0,1)$), we get a unique solution $f$.\nThe number of such functions $h$ is $c$.\nTherefore, the cardinality of the set of solutions is at least $c$.\nSince the set of solutions is a subset of the set of all continuous functions from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$, its cardinality can be at most $c$.\nBy the Cantor-Bernstein theorem, the cardinality of the set of solutions is exactly $c$.\n\nLet's double-check the case where $f$ is strictly decreasing.\nIf $f$ is strictly decreasing, then $f \\circ f$ is strictly increasing. This is consistent with $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$.\nLet's see if we can construct such a solution.\nIf $f$ is decreasing, there must be a unique fixed point $x_0$ such that $f(x_0)=x_0$. Then $f(f(x_0)) = f(x_0) = x_0$. This would mean $\\exp(x_0)=x_0$, which has no real solutions. Thus, a strictly decreasing continuous solution $f:\\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ cannot exist.\n\nSo we only need to consider strictly increasing solutions.\nThe argument seems sound. The freedom to choose a continuous increasing function on an interval like $[0, a]$ where $f(0)=a, f(a)=1$ and $a\\in(0,1)$, gives a set of solutions of the cardinality of the continuum.\nThis construction method is also referenced in one of the search results, although not worked out in detail for this specific equation. It states \"For any function g on the reals, there are numerous functions f such that f(f(x)) = g(x)...If g is continuous, then this f can be chosen also to be continuous.\" And importantly, \"There are 2^|R| many such h's, and hence also this many f's.\" This refers to functions on the reals, and for continuous functions, the cardinality is c.\n\nSo, the cardinality is $c$, the cardinality of the continuum, which is also denoted as $2^{\\aleph_0}$.\nThe question asks for the cardinality of the set.\nThe cardinality of the set of real numbers, $|\\mathbb{R}|$, is denoted by $c$.\nFinal check on the reasoning:\n1.  Any solution $f$ must be continuous and injective, hence monotonic.\n2.  $f(f(x))=\\exp(x)$ is increasing, so $f$ can be increasing or decreasing.\n3.  A decreasing continuous function $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ must have a fixed point. But if $f(x_0)=x_0$, then $\\exp(x_0)=x_0$, which is impossible. So $f$ must be strictly increasing.\n4.  For an increasing solution, we can choose an initial continuous, increasing segment of the function on an interval, and this determines the rest of the function.\n5.  Let's choose the interval $$. Let $f(0)=a$ and $f(1)=b$. Then $f(a)=\\exp(0)=1$ and $f(b)=\\exp(1)=e$. Since $f$ is increasing, $0<1 \\implies a<b$. Also $a<b \\implies f(a)<f(b) \\implies 1<e$, which is true. We also need to specify $a$. $f(x)>x$ cannot be true for all $x$, but $f(f(x))=\\exp(x)>x$ is true. $f(0)=a$. If $a>0$, then $f(a)=1$. If $a=0$, $f(0)=0$ (fixed point, impossible). If $a<0$, $f(a)=1$. But this implies $0>a \\implies f(0)>f(a) \\implies a>1$. Contradiction. So we must have $f(0)>0$.\n6.  The construction relies on choosing an arbitrary continuous increasing function on an interval, for example, from $[a_0, a_1]$ to $[a_1, a_2]$, where $a_2 = \\exp(a_0)$. The set of such functions has cardinality $c$.\n7.  Since the set of solutions is a subset of the set of all continuous functions, its cardinality is at most $c$.\n8.  From points 6 and 7, the cardinality is exactly $c$.Here is a step-by-step derivation of the cardinality of the set of continuous functions $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ that satisfy the equation $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the properties of any such function `f`.\n\n1.  **Injectivity:** The function `f` must be injective. To see this, assume that `f(x₁) = f(x₂)`. Applying `f` to both sides gives `f(f(x₁)) = f(f(x₂))`. From the given equation, this means `exp(x₁) = exp(x₂)`. Since the exponential function is one-to-one, we must have `x₁ = x₂`. Therefore, `f` is an injective function.\n\n2.  **Monotonicity:** A continuous function that is injective on the real line must be strictly monotonic. This means `f` must be either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing.\n\n3.  **Determining the direction of monotonicity:** Let's consider the composition `f(f(x))`.\n    *   If `f` is strictly increasing, then `f(f(x))` is also strictly increasing.\n    *   If `f` is strictly decreasing, then `f(f(x))` is strictly increasing.\n    The function `exp(x)` is strictly increasing, which is consistent with `f` being either strictly increasing or decreasing.\n\n    However, let's assume `f` is strictly decreasing. A strictly decreasing continuous function on `ℝ` must have exactly one fixed point, say `x₀`, where `f(x₀) = x₀`. If we apply `f` to this fixed point, we get `f(f(x₀)) = f(x₀) = x₀`. But from our original equation, `f(f(x₀)) = exp(x₀)`. This would imply `exp(x₀) = x₀`, an equation which has no real solutions. Therefore, a continuous, strictly decreasing solution `f` cannot exist.\n\n    This leaves us with the conclusion that any continuous solution `f` must be strictly increasing.\n\n4.  **Constructing solutions:** The existence of solutions to the functional equation `f(f(x)) = g(x)` is a known topic in mathematics. For the specific case of `g(x) = exp(x)`, not only do solutions exist, but there is a large family of them.\n\n    We can construct these solutions. A key idea is that the behavior of `f` on a single interval can determine the entire function. Let's choose a value for `f(0)`, say `f(0) = a`. Then `f(a) = f(f(0)) = exp(0) = 1`. Since `f` is strictly increasing and we know that `exp(x) > x` for all real `x`, it must be that `f(x) > x` for all `x`. If we had `f(x₀) < x₀` for some `x₀`, then `f(f(x₀)) < f(x₀) < x₀`, but `exp(x₀) > x₀`. Therefore, `f(0) = a > 0`. Also, since `f` is increasing, from `a > 0` it follows that `f(a) > f(0)`, which means `1 > a`. So, we must choose `a` such that `0 < a < 1`.\n\n    For any choice of `a` in `(0, 1)`, we can define `f` on the interval `[0, a]` to be any strictly increasing continuous function `h(x)` such that `h(0) = a` and `h(a) = 1`. For every different choice of such a function `h`, we will get a different solution `f` for all `x` in `ℝ`.\n\n5.  **Determining the cardinality:** We need to find the number of ways we can choose this initial function `h(x)`. The set of continuous functions from a closed interval to the real numbers has the same cardinality as the real numbers, which is the cardinality of the continuum, denoted by `c` or `2^{\\aleph_0}`. The subset of these functions that are strictly increasing from `[0, a]` to `[a, 1]` also has the cardinality of the continuum.\n\n    To be more explicit, let's consider two different continuous, strictly increasing functions, `h₁(x)` and `h₂(x)`, on the interval `[0, a]` that both satisfy the boundary conditions `h(0)=a` and `h(a)=1`. Each of these can be extended to a full solution, let's call them `f₁(x)` and `f₂(x)`, for the equation `f(f(x)) = exp(x)`. Since `h₁(x)` and `h₂(x)` are different, `f₁(x)` and `f₂(x)` will also be different functions.\n\n    The number of such initial \"seed\" functions `h(x)` is `c` (the cardinality of the continuum). Thus, there are at least `c` solutions to the equation.\n\n    The set of all continuous functions from `ℝ` to `ℝ` has cardinality `c`. Since our set of solutions is a subset of all continuous functions, its cardinality can be at most `c`.\n\n    By the Cantor-Schröder-Bernstein theorem, since the cardinality of the set of solutions is both at least `c` and at most `c`, it must be exactly `c`.\n\nThe cardinality of the set of continuous functions $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ that satisfy the equation $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$ is the cardinality of the continuum.\n\n<<<c>>>"
