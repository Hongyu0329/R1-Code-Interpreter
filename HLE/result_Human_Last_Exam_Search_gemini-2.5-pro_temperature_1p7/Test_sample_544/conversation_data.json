  "response_list": [
    "The reaction of methyl phenyl sulfoxide with one equivalent of triflic anhydride and one equivalent of trimethylsilyl cyanide is a Pummerer-type reaction. In this process, the sulfoxide is activated by the highly electrophilic triflic anhydride. This is followed by the introduction of a cyanide group from trimethylsilyl cyanide. The final product is 2-(phenylsulfanyl)acetonitrile.\n\nThe IUPAC name for this product is 2-(phenylsulfanyl)acetonitrile. It is also commonly known as (phenylthio)acetonitrile. The \"phenylsulfanyl\" nomenclature is generally preferred in IUPAC naming conventions over \"phenylthio\" for the C6H5S- group.\n\n<<<2-(phenylsulfanyl)acetonitrile>>>"
