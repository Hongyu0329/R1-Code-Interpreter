    "According to United States Pharmacopeia (USP) guidelines, a single-dose ampule must be used immediately after it is opened and cannot be stored for any period. Once an ampule is opened, its contents are intended for a single use and any remaining portion should be discarded.\n\nThe guidelines distinguish between different types of single-dose containers. While a single-dose vial that is punctured in a sterile environment (ISO Class 5 or cleaner air) may be used for up to 12 hours after the initial entry, this does not apply to ampules. Opened ampules are not to be stored under any circumstances.\n\nRegulations from bodies such as the National Association of Pharmacy Regulatory Authorities (NAPRA) and state-level rules like the California Code of Regulations also stipulate that single-dose ampules are for immediate use only, and once opened, they shall not be stored for any length of time.\n\n<<<Opened single-dose ampules have no storage time and must be used immediately; they cannot be stored.>>>"
