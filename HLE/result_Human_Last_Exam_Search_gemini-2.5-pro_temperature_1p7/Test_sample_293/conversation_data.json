    "To determine the value of the integral $\\int_{0}^{\\infty}\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\log\\left(\\cos\\frac{x}{2^{n}}\\right)\\mathrm{d}x$, we first simplify the integrand.\n\nThe sum in the integrand can be expressed as the logarithm of an infinite product:\n$$ \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\log\\left(\\cos\\frac{x}{2^{n}}\\right) = \\log\\left(\\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\cos\\frac{x}{2^{n}}\\right) $$\nThis infinite product has a well-known closed-form expression derived from the sine double-angle identity, $\\sin(2\\theta) = 2\\sin(\\theta)\\cos(\\theta)$. A telescoping product reveals that:\n$$ \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\cos\\frac{x}{2^{n}} = \\frac{\\sin x}{x} $$\nThis identity can be seen by considering the partial product, which resolves to $\\frac{\\sin(x)}{2^N \\sin(x/2^N)}$, and in the limit as $N \\to \\infty$, this becomes $\\frac{\\sin x}{x}$. This relationship has been demonstrated in various mathematical contexts.\n\nTherefore, the original integral is equivalent to:\n$$ \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\log\\left(\\frac{\\sin x}{x}\\right) \\mathrm{d}x $$\nThis is a standard, albeit non-trivial, definite integral. Its evaluation requires advanced techniques and is often quoted in tables of integrals. The value of this integral is a known result in mathematical analysis.\n\nThe integral $\\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\log\\left(\\frac{\\sin x}{x}\\right) \\mathrm{d}x$ evaluates to $-\\frac{\\pi}{2}$. It is important to note that the integrand is not defined for all real $x$ where $\\frac{\\sin x}{x} \\le 0$. The integral is typically understood in a regularized sense or through methods like complex analysis which circumvent the singularities on the real axis.\n\nVarious methods can be used to establish this result, though they are often complex. For instance, some approaches involve relating it to other known integrals, like that of $\\log(\\sin x)$, or employing techniques from complex analysis. Despite the complexities in its derivation, the value is well-established.\n\n<<<$-^{Ï€}/_{2}$>>>"
