    "Based on the complete classification of finite groups containing maximal by inclusion product-free sets of size 3, there are **11** such non-isomorphic groups.\n\nA subset *S* of a group *G* is called product-free if for any elements *a* and *b* in *S* (including the case where *a* = *b*), their product *ab* is not in *S*. A product-free set is maximal by inclusion (also known as locally maximal) if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set in the same group.\n\nThe classification of finite groups that contain such sets of size 3 was completed by C. S. Anabanti and S. B. Hart. In their 2015 paper, \"Locally Maximal Product-free Sets of Size 3\", they proved that any finite group containing a maximal by inclusion product-free set of size 3 must have an order of at most 24. This work confirmed that a list of such sets and their corresponding groups, originally compiled by Giudici and Hart in 2009, is complete.\n\nThe full list of non-isomorphic groups that contain a maximal by inclusion product-free set of size 3 is:\n*   **C_6**, the cyclic group of order 6\n*   **S_3**, the symmetric group on 3 elements (isomorphic to D_6, the dihedral group of order 6)\n*   **C_8**, the cyclic group of order 8\n*   **D_8**, the dihedral group of order 8\n*   **Q_8**, the quaternion group of order 8\n*   **C_9**, the cyclic group of order 9\n*   **C_10**, the cyclic group of order 10\n*   **C_12**, the cyclic group of order 12\n*   **A_4**, the alternating group on 4 elements\n*   **Q_12**, the dicyclic group of order 12\n*   **SL(2,3)**, the special linear group of degree 2 over the field of 3 elements (also known as the binary tetrahedral group, of order 24)\n\nCounting these distinct non-isomorphic groups gives a total of 11.\n\n<<<11>>>"
