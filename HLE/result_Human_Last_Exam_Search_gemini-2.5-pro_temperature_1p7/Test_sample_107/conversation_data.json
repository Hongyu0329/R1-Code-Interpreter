    "To determine the smallest appropriate IP access control list (ACL) entry for the networks `172.20.96.0/19` and `172.20.128.0/19`, a summarization of these two networks is required.\n\nFirst, let's define the range of each network:\n*   **172.20.96.0/19**: This network has a subnet mask of `255.255.224.0`. The IP address range is from `172.20.96.0` to `172.20.127.255`.\n*   **172.20.128.0/19**: This network also has a subnet mask of `255.255.224.0`. The IP address range is from `172.20.128.0` to `172.20.159.255`.\n\nTo create a single ACL entry that covers both of these networks, we need to find a summary address and a corresponding wildcard mask that includes all the addresses from `172.20.96.0` to `172.20.159.255`.\n\nLet's analyze the third octet of the IP addresses in binary:\n*   The start of the range is 96, which is `01100000` in binary.\n*   The end of the range is 159, which is `10011111` in binary.\n\nBy examining the binary representations of the combined range (96-159), we can identify the common bits to determine the network address and the bits that vary to determine the wildcard mask.\n\nThe smallest single block that contains these two consecutive /19 blocks is a /18 block. Let's find the common prefix for the network addresses `172.20.96.0` and `172.20.128.0`:\n*   `172.20.96.0`:  `10101100.00010100.01100000.00000000`\n*   `172.20.128.0`: `10101100.00010100.10000000.00000000`\n\nThe first 17 bits are not identical, which means a straightforward supernet is not immediately obvious. However, these two /19 blocks are contiguous and together form a larger, summarizable block. The total range of addresses is from `172.20.96.0` to `172.20.159.255`.\n\nThis combined range can be represented by the network `172.20.96.0/18`. A /18 subnet has a mask of `255.255.192.0`. To calculate the wildcard mask for an ACL, we subtract the subnet mask from `255.255.255.255`.\n\n`255.255.255.255`\n- `255.255.192.0`\n-----------------\n`0.0.63.255`\n\nThus, the ACL entry that matches all hosts in both networks is `172.20.96.0` with a wildcard mask of `0.0.63.255`. This entry covers the IP range from `172.20.96.0` to `172.20.159.255`, which precisely matches the combined address space of the two specified networks.\n\n<<<172.20.96.0 0.0.63.255>>>"
