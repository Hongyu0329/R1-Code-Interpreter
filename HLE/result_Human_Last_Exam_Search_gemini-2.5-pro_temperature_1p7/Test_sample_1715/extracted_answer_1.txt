*   **Lot A:** The ownership is legally unresolved, creating a **clouded title**. James is the intended owner but has no recorded deed for this lot. His tax and trailer numbers (**0987654321** and **0987654321.1**) correspond to the trailer on this lot, but not to the land itself.
*   **Lot B:** Is legally owned by **Tommy's Estate**. The corrective deed filed in 2017 established this ownership. The associated tax and trailer numbers are **1234567890** and **1234567890.1**. However, the title to Lot B is also considered **clouded** due to the unresolved lien James placed on it in 2016.
