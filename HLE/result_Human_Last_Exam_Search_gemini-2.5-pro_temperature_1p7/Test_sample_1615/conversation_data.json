    "Let $G$ be a graph with $n=12345$ vertices, and let $\\chi(G)$ be its chromatic number, which is the minimum number of colors needed for a proper vertex coloring. The problem states that $G$ is not a complete graph ($K_{12345}$). We want to find the maximum possible value of $\\chi(G)$.\n\nA fundamental property of the chromatic number is that for any graph with $n$ vertices, $\\chi(G) \\le n$. Furthermore, $\\chi(G) = n$ if and only if $G$ is a complete graph, $K_n$. Since the graph $G$ is specified to be other than the complete graph $K_{12345}$, its chromatic number must be strictly less than 12345. This means the maximum possible value is at most 12344.\n\nTo determine if a chromatic number of 12344 is achievable, we must show that there exists a graph $G$ with 12345 vertices, which is not complete, and has a chromatic number of 12344.\n\nConsider the following graph construction:\nLet $G$ be a graph formed by the disjoint union of a complete graph on 12344 vertices, $K_{12344}$, and a single isolated vertex, $K_1$.\n*   The total number of vertices in this graph is $12344 + 1 = 12345$.\n*   This graph is not a complete graph, because the isolated vertex is not connected to any other vertices.\n*   The chromatic number of a disconnected graph is the maximum of the chromatic numbers of its connected components.\n*   The components are $K_{12344}$ and $K_1$. The chromatic number of a complete graph $K_m$ is $m$.\n*   Therefore, $\\chi(K_{12344}) = 12344$ and $\\chi(K_1) = 1$.\n*   The chromatic number of our constructed graph $G$ is $\\max(12344, 1) = 12344$.\n\nThis construction provides an example of a graph with 12345 vertices that is not complete and requires 12344 colours.\n\nAccording to Brooks's Theorem, for any connected graph $G$ that is not a complete graph or an odd cycle, its chromatic number is at most its maximum degree, $\\Delta(G)$. In a graph with 12345 vertices, the maximum degree is at most 12344. Thus, for any such connected graph, the chromatic number would be at most 12344.\n\nSince we have shown that $\\chi(G) < 12345$ for any non-complete graph $G$ on 12345 vertices, and we have constructed a valid graph for which $\\chi(G) = 12344$, the maximum number of colors needed is 12344.\n\n<<<12344>>>"
