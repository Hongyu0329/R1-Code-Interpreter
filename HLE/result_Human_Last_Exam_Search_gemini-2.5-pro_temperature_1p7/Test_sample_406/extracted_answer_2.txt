An FGH-tripled fixed point for the mappings F: X × Y × Z → X, G: Y × X × Z → Y, and H: Z × Y × X → Z is a point (x, y, z) that simultaneously satisfies F(x, y, z) = x, G(y, x, z) = y, and H(z, y, x) = z. The primary conditions for the existence of such a point are established within the framework of partially ordered complete metric spaces and include: the mixed monotone property of the functions F, G, and H; a contractive condition on these functions; the existence of a suitable set of initial points; and either the continuity of the functions or a regularity property of the spaces.
