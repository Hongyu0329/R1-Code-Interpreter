    "An FGH-tripled fixed point for the functions F: X × Y × Z → X, G: Y × X × Z → Y, and H: Z × Y × X → Z is a point (x, y, z) ∈ X × Y × Z such that:\n\n*   F(x, y, z) = x\n*   G(y, x, z) = y\n*   H(z, y, x) = z\n\nThe conditions for the existence and uniqueness of such a point are typically established in the framework of partially ordered complete metric spaces. These conditions are extensions of similar theorems for coupled and tripled fixed points.\n\nThe primary conditions for the existence of an FGH-tripled fixed point are as follows:\n\n1.  **Partially Ordered Complete Metric Spaces**: The sets (X, ≤<sub>X</sub>, d<sub>X</sub>), (Y, ≤<sub>Y</sub>, d<sub>Y</sub>), and (Z, ≤<sub>Z</sub>, d<sub>Z</sub>) must be partially ordered complete metric spaces. This means that each set has a partial order relation (≤), a metric (d) that makes it a complete metric space (meaning every Cauchy sequence converges to a point within the space). The product space X × Y × Z is endowed with the partial order (x, y, z) ≤ (u, v, w) if and only if x ≤<sub>X</sub> u, y ≥<sub>Y</sub> v, and z ≤<sub>Z</sub> w.\n\n2.  **Mixed Monotone Property**: The mappings F, G, and H are required to have the mixed monotone property. This property dictates how the functions behave with respect to the partial order. For any x, u ∈ X, y, v ∈ Y, and z, w ∈ Z:\n    *   **F** is non-decreasing in its first and third arguments and non-increasing in its second argument. That is, if x ≤<sub>X</sub> u, y ≥<sub>Y</sub> v, and z ≤<sub>Z</sub> w, then F(x, y, z) ≤<sub>X</sub> F(u, v, w).\n    *   **G** is non-decreasing in its first and third arguments and non-increasing in its second argument. That is, if y ≥<sub>Y</sub> v, x ≤<sub>X</sub> u, and z ≤<sub>Z</sub> w, then G(y, x, z) ≥<sub>Y</sub> G(v, u, w).\n    *   **H** is non-decreasing in its first and third arguments and non-increasing in its second argument. That is, if z ≤<sub>Z</sub> w, y ≥<sub>Y</sub> v, and x ≤<sub>X</sub> u, then H(z, y, x) ≤<sub>Z</sub> H(w, v, u).\n\n3.  **Contractive Condition**: The functions F, G, and H must satisfy a contractive condition. This is a crucial requirement that ensures the iterative sequences generated by the functions will converge. There exist constants k, l, m ∈ [0, 1) with k + l + m < 1 such that for all x, u ∈ X, y, v ∈ Y, and z, w ∈ Z with x ≥ u, y ≤ v, and z ≥ w, the following inequalities hold:\n    *   d<sub>X</sub>(F(x, y, z), F(u, v, w)) ≤ k/3 * (d<sub>X</sub>(x, u) + d<sub>Y</sub>(y, v) + d<sub>Z</sub>(z, w))\n    *   d<sub>Y</sub>(G(y, x, z), G(v, u, w)) ≤ l/3 * (d<sub>Y</sub>(y, v) + d<sub>X</sub>(x, u) + d<sub>Z</sub>(z, w))\n    *   d<sub>Z</sub>(H(z, y, x), H(w, v, u)) ≤ m/3 * (d<sub>Z</sub>(z, w) + d<sub>Y</sub>(y, v) + d<sub>X</sub>(x, u))\n\n4.  **Existence of Initial Points**: There must exist initial points x<sub>0</sub> ∈ X, y<sub>0</sub> ∈ Y, and z<sub>0</sub> ∈ Z such that:\n    *   x<sub>0</sub> ≤<sub>X</sub> F(x<sub>0</sub>, y<sub>0</sub>, z<sub>0</sub>)\n    *   y<sub>0</sub> ≥<sub>Y</sub> G(y<sub>0</sub>, x<sub>0</sub>, z<sub>0</sub>)\n    *   z<sub>0</sub> ≤<sub>Z</sub> H(z<sub>0</sub>, y<sub>0</sub>, x<sub>0</sub>)\n    This condition establishes a starting point for the iterative process that will converge to the fixed point.\n\n5.  **Continuity or Regularity**:\n    *   Either the functions F, G, and H are continuous.\n    *   Or, if the functions are not necessarily continuous, the spaces must satisfy a regularity condition: if a non-decreasing sequence {x<sub>n</sub>} → x, then x<sub>n</sub> ≤ x for all n, and if a non-increasing sequence {y<sub>n</sub>} → y, then y<sub>n</sub> ≥ y for all n.\n\nIf these conditions are met, then there exist x ∈ X, y ∈ Y, and z ∈ Z such that F(x, y, z) = x, G(y, x, z) = y, and H(z, y, x) = z. Furthermore, if the contractive condition holds for all x, u ∈ X, y, v ∈ Y, and z, w ∈ Z (not just for those with a certain ordering), then the FGH-tripled fixed point is unique.\n\nIt is worth noting that the user's prompt listed `G:Y*X*Y→Y`. This is likely a typographical error, as the theory of FGH-tripled fixed points, which builds on coupled and tripled fixed point theory, generally involves the three distinct spaces X, Y, and Z in the arguments of each function. The conditions described above are for the standard definition of an FGH-tripled fixed point as found in the mathematical literature.\n\n<<<An FGH-tripled fixed point for the mappings F: X × Y × Z → X, G: Y × X × Z → Y, and H: Z × Y × X → Z is a point (x, y, z) that simultaneously satisfies F(x, y, z) = x, G(y, x, z) = y, and H(z, y, x) = z.
