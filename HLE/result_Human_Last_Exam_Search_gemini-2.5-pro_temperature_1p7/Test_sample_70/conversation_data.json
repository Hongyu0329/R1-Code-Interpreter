    "The flag of Denmark, when viewed as a matrix, has a linear algebraic rank of 2. This is determined by interpreting the question's constraint that \"values in each matrix are chosen so that the rank of each flag is maximal.\" The most consistent way to interpret this is to consider the number of fundamental visual components that are distinguished by color. The Danish flag consists of two such components: a red field and a white cross. With color values chosen to be linearly independent, these two components result in a rank of 2.\n\nTo find which flags of African nations have the same rank, we must identify those that are also composed of two distinct visual components. Following this logic, four African national flags have a rank of 2:\n\n*   **Morocco**: The Moroccan flag features a red field with a green pentagram, known as the Seal of Solomon, in the center. This composition of a field and a single-colored emblem constitutes two visual components, giving it a rank of 2.\n*   **Nigeria**: The Nigerian flag consists of three vertical stripes, with green on the outer stripes and white in the middle. This design can be viewed as a green field with a central white vertical bar (a pale). These two elements give the flag a rank of 2.\n*   **Somalia**: The flag of Somalia is composed of a light blue field with a single white five-pointed star in the center. The blue field and the white star are the two visual components, resulting in a rank of 2.\n*   **Tunisia**: The Tunisian flag has a red field with a white disk in the center, which in turn contains a red star and crescent. Despite the emblem's details, the flag is composed of two colors, red and white, forming two main visual components: the red field and the white disk. This results in a rank of 2.\n\n<<<Morocco, Nigeria, Somalia, and Tunisia>>>"
