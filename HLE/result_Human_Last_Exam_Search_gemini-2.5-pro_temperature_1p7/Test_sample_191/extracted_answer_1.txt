The breakdown of amyloid-beta peptides by enzymes such as Matrix Metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), Neprilysin (NEP), and Insulin-Degrading Enzyme (IDE), often secreted by macrophages, allows for the engulfment and clearance of amyloid. The efficiency of this process is influenced by proteins like Apolipoprotein E (ApoE).
