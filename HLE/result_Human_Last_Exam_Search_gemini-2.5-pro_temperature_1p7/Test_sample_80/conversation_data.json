    "A standard 8x8 chessboard has 64 squares in total. The edge squares are those that form the border of the board. There are 28 such squares. The goal is to place the maximum number of bishops on these 28 squares so that no two bishops can attack each other.\n\nA key characteristic of bishops is that they move and attack along diagonals. This means a bishop on a light-colored square can only attack other pieces on light-colored squares, and a bishop on a dark-colored square can only attack other pieces on dark-colored squares. The 28 edge squares are evenly split between 14 light squares and 14 dark squares. We can, therefore, consider the placement of bishops on squares of each color independently.\n\n**Dark Squares:**\nOn the 14 dark edge squares, a maximum of 7 non-attacking bishops can be placed. The placement of these bishops can be visualized as placing one bishop on each of the dark squares of the first row (4 bishops) and three bishops on specific dark squares of the last row (b8, d8, f8).\n\n**Light Squares:**\nSimilarly, on the 14 light edge squares, a maximum of 7 non-attacking bishops can be placed. This can be achieved by placing one bishop on each of the light squares of the first row (4 bishops) and three on specific light squares of the last row (a8, c8, e8).\n\nIn total, the maximum number of non-attacking bishops that can be placed on the edge squares is the sum of the maximums for each color, which is 7 (dark) + 7 (light) = 14 bishops.\n\nThe question asks for the number of edge squares that would *lack* bishops. To find this, we subtract the total number of placed bishops from the total number of edge squares:\n\n28 (total edge squares) - 14 (placed bishops) = 14 squares.\n\nTherefore, if two people succeeded in placing the maximum possible number of non-attacking bishops on the edge squares, 14 of those squares would remain empty.\n\n<<<14>>>"
