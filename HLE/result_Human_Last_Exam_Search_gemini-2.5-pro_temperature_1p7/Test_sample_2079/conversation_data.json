    "While the specific name of the judge of Bártfa (now Bardejov) in 1461 is not directly mentioned in the available search results, historical records strongly indicate that the town had a functioning judicial system with an elected judge during this period.\n\nBártfa, a free royal town since 1376, had the privilege of electing its own judge and town council. This is corroborated by a charter from King Ladislaus V, which was addressed to the \"judges, councilors, all citizens, and the entire community of the city of Bartfeld.\"\n\nThe most definitive source for identifying the judge in 1461 is likely the book ***Civitas nostra Bardfa vocata. Správa mesta Bardejov v stredoveku (1320–1526)*** by historian Mária Fedorčáková. Reviews and the table of contents for this work explicitly state that its appendices contain lists of the judges and town council members of Bardejov up to the 1520s. Unfortunately, the content of these appendices is not available in the provided search results.\n\nAdditionally, the Hungaricana digital library archives documents from the medieval collection of the Bártfa city archives for the year 1461, issued by the city itself. These records would almost certainly contain the name of the presiding judge of that year.\n\nTherefore, while the name of the judge of Bártfa for the year 1461 cannot be definitively provided from the available online information, it is highly probable that the name is documented and can be found by consulting Mária Fedorčáková's aforementioned book or the archival records of Bardejov.\n\n<<<The specific name of the judge of Bártfa in 1461 is not available in the provided search results, but the information likely exists in specialized historical publications and archives.>>>"
