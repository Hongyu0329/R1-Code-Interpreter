    "The Oscar-nominated film in which a character seals their fate by saying \"Thank you\" while boarding a bus is the 2006 drama **Babel**.\n\nIn the film, directed by Alejandro González Iñárritu, an American tourist named Susan (played by Cate Blanchett) is on a vacation in Morocco with her husband Richard (played by Brad Pitt). A pivotal moment occurs when a tour bus arrives. While it is not explicitly stated in all plot summaries, the act of boarding this particular bus at that specific time, following a tense exchange, sets in motion the tragic events of the film. Shortly after they are on board, Susan is struck by a stray bullet from a rifle fired by two local boys. This single event connects multiple storylines across the globe, dramatically altering the lives of all involved. The film was critically acclaimed and received seven Academy Award nominations, including for Best Picture.\n\n<<<Babel>>>"
