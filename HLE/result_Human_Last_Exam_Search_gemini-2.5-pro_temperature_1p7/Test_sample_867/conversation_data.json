    "I am unable to provide a precise count of the *sissone fermes* performed by Svetlana Zakharova in the Act II Odette variation of the 2014 Bolshoi Theatre's \"Swan Lake\" choreographed by Yuri Grigorovich.\n\nDespite extensive research confirming that Svetlana Zakharova performed this role in the specified production and that a 2015 recording of the same production exists on DVD and Blu-ray, a detailed choreographic breakdown necessary for an accurate count of this specific ballet step is not available in the text-based resources found.\n\nReviews and articles discuss the general style and quality of her performance, but lack the step-by-step analysis required to answer your question. Similarly, video links that may have provided a visual reference are no longer active, and I do not have the capability to watch and analyze video content.\n\nTherefore, without a visual account or a document with a detailed choreographic description, a definitive answer cannot be given.\n\n<<<I am unable to answer the question.>>>"
