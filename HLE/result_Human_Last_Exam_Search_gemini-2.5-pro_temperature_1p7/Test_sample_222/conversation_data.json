    "This problem can be solved by utilizing the properties of the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), specifically the principle behind the decimation-in-time Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm.\n\nLet the 8-point sequence be denoted by `y(n) = {x(0), h(0), x(1), h(1), x(2), h(2), x(3), h(3)}`. We want to find its 8-point DFT, `Y(k)`.\n\nThe 8-point DFT `Y(k)` is defined as:\n`Y(k) = Σ_{n=0}^{7} y(n) * W_8^(nk)` for `k = 0, 1, ..., 7`, where `W_8 = e^(-j2π/8)`.\n\nWe can split the summation into even and odd indices of `n`.\nLet `n = 2m` for even indices and `n = 2m+1` for odd indices.\nThe even-indexed elements of `y(n)` form the sequence `x(m) = y(2m) = {x(0), x(1), x(2), x(3)}`.\nThe odd-indexed elements of `y(n)` form the sequence `h(m) = y(2m+1) = {h(0), h(1), h(2), h(3)}`.\n\nThe DFT `Y(k)` can be expressed as:\n`Y(k) = Σ_{m=0}^{3} y(2m) * W_8^(2mk) + Σ_{m=0}^{3} y(2m+1) * W_8^((2m+1)k)`\n`Y(k) = Σ_{m=0}^{3} x(m) * (W_8^2)^(mk) + W_8^k * Σ_{m=0}^{3} h(m) * (W_8^2)^(mk)`\n\nSince `W_8^2 = e^(-j2π*2/8) = e^(-j2π/4) = W_4`, the summations are the 4-point DFTs of `x(m)` and `h(m)`, which are `X(k)` and `H(k)` respectively.\n\nFor `k = 0, 1, 2, 3`, the formula is:\n`Y(k) = X(k) + W_8^k * H(k)`\n\nFor the upper half of the DFT points, `k = 4, 5, 6, 7`, we let `k' = k - 4`. The formula becomes:\n`Y(k' + 4) = X(k') - W_8^(k') * H(k')` for `k' = 0, 1, 2, 3`.\n\nWe are given:\n`X(k) = [1, j, -1, -j]`\n`H(k) = [0, 1+j, 1, 1-j]`\n\nWe need the twiddle factors `W_8^k`:\n*   `W_8^0 = 1`\n*   `W_8^1 = e^(-jπ/4) = cos(π/4) - j*sin(π/4) = (1-j)/√2`\n*   `W_8^2 = e^(-jπ/2) = -j`\n*   `W_8^3 = e^(-j3π/4) = cos(3π/4) - j*sin(3π/4) = (-1-j)/√2`\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n*   **Y(0)** = X(0) + W_8^0 * H(0) = 1 + 1 * 0 = 1\n*   **Y(1)** = X(1) + W_8^1 * H(1) = j + [((1-j)/√2) * (1+j)] = j + [2/√2] = j + √2\n*   **Y(2)** = X(2) + W_8^2 * H(2) = -1 + (-j) * 1 = -1 - j\n*   **Y(3)** = X(3) + W_8^3 * H(3) = -j + [((-1-j)/√2) * (1-j)] = -j + [-2/√2] = -j - √2\n*   **Y(4)** = X(0) - W_8^0 * H(0) = 1 - 1 * 0 = 1\n*   **Y(5)** = X(1) - W_8^1 * H(1) = j - [((1-j)/√2) * (1+j)] = j - [2/√2] = j - √2\n*   **Y(6)** = X(2) - W_8^2 * H(2) = -1 - (-j) * 1 = -1 + j\n*   **Y(7)** = X(3) - W_8^3 * H(3) = -j - [((-1-j)/√2) * (1-j)] = -j - [-2/√2] = -j + √2\n\nThe 8-point DFT is `Y(k) = {Y(0), Y(1), Y(2), Y(3), Y(4), Y(5), Y(6), Y(7)}`.\n\n<<<[1, √2+j, -1-j, -√2-j, 1, -√2+j, -1+j, √2-j]>>>"
