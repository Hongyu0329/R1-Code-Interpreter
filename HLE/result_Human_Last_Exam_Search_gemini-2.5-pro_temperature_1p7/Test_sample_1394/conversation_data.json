    "The given differential equation is:\n$x^{2} y^{2}=x^{3} y \\frac{d y}{d x}+y^{2}\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)^{2}+x y\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)+9 x^{2}$\n\nThis equation is a non-linear first-order ordinary differential equation. We can rearrange it into a quadratic form in terms of $p = \\frac{dy}{dx}$:\n$y^{2} p^{2} + (x^{3}y + xy)p - (x^{2}y^{2} - 9x^{2}) = 0$\n$y^{2} p^{2} + xy(x^2+1)p - x^2(y^2-9) = 0$\n\nThis equation is challenging to solve for a general solution in terms of elementary functions. However, it is possible to find particular solutions.\n\n**Singular Solutions:**\nLet's test for constant solutions of the form $y=c$. In this case, $\\frac{dy}{dx} = 0$. The equation simplifies to:\n$x^2 c^2 = x^3 c(0) + c^2(0)^2 + xc(0) + 9x^2$\n$x^2 c^2 = 9x^2$\n$c^2 = 9 \\implies c = \\pm 3$\n\nThus, two solutions to the differential equation are $y=3$ and $y=-3$. These are singular solutions.\n\n**Another Particular Solution:**\nLet's test for a solution of the form $x^2+y^2=C$, where C is a constant.\nDifferentiating with respect to x, we get $2x + 2y\\frac{dy}{dx} = 0$, which means $y\\frac{dy}{dx} = -x$.\nWe can rewrite the differential equation by grouping terms with $y\\frac{dy}{dx}$:\n$(y\\frac{dy}{dx})^2 + x(x^2+1)(y\\frac{dy}{dx}) - x^2(y^2-9) = 0$\nNow, substitute $y\\frac{dy}{dx} = -x$ into this form:\n$(-x)^2 + x(x^2+1)(-x) - x^2(y^2-9) = 0$\n$x^2 - x^4 - x^2 - x^2(y^2-9) = 0$\n$-x^4 - x^2y^2 + 9x^2 = 0$\n$-x^2(x^2+y^2-9)=0$\nThis equation holds true for all $x$ if $x^2+y^2-9=0$, which means $x^2+y^2=9$.\n\nThus, $x^2+y^2=9$ is another particular solution to the differential equation.\n\nFinding a general solution involving an arbitrary constant that encompasses all possible solutions proves to be intractable with standard methods, likely indicating a misstatement in the problem or the need for advanced techniques. The solutions found are specific solution curves rather than a family of curves defined by a general constant.\n\nThe solutions found are:\n$y=3$\n$y=-3$\n$x^2+y^2=9$\n\n<<<y=3, y=-3, x^2+y^2=9>>>"
