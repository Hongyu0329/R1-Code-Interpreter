    "I am unable to provide a definitive count of the *pas de Balanchines* performed by Svetlana Gileva in the Jete Woman solo of William Forsythe's \"In the Middle, Somewhat Elevated\" with the Semperoper Ballett in 2015.\n\nMy research confirmed that Svetlana Gileva did perform this role with the Semperoper Ballett during that period. Reviews and publications from 2015 and later mention her performance in this specific production. I was also able to locate records of video recordings of the \"Jete Woman solo\" from a performance on November 9, 2015, featuring Ms. Gileva.\n\nUnfortunately, all located links to this video content are no longer active, and the videos are unavailable for viewing. Without access to a visual recording of the performance, it is impossible to conduct a choreographic analysis and count the specific ballet steps as requested.\n\nThe term \"pas de Balanchine\" itself can be somewhat open to interpretation within the context of Forsythe's deconstructed classical style, further complicating a definitive count without visual confirmation. While Forsythe's work is deeply rooted in classical ballet, including the work of George Balanchine, his choreography reimagines and abstracts these traditional steps. A \"pas de Balanchine\" is a specific step, and identifying it accurately within Forsythe's complex and dynamic choreography would require careful visual analysis.\n\nTherefore, an accurate answer to your question cannot be provided without a viewable copy of the 2015 performance.\n\n<<<I am unable to provide an answer to the question as I cannot find a working video of the performance to analyze the choreography.>>>"
