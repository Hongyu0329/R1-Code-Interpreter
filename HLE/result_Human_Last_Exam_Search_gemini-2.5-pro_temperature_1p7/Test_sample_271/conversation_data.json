    "The provided search results confirm the key steps of the reasoning. Specifically:\n*   and confirm that the polynomial $h(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$ by Eisenstein's criterion for $p=3$. They also confirm that it has three real roots and thus its Galois group over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is $S_5$.\n*   The formula for the discriminant of a polynomial $x^n + ax + b$ is given in various forms in the results. The calculation of the discriminant of $h(x)$ is a standard, albeit large, computation. My calculation resulted in $D_h = -14863419$. This is a negative number, so its square root is imaginary, confirming that the quadratic subfield $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{D_h})$ is an imaginary quadratic field, distinct from the real quadratic field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n*   and confirm that the only normal subgroups of $S_5$ are the trivial group, the alternating group $A_5$, and $S_5$ itself. This is a standard result in group theory.\n*   The structure of Galois groups of composite fields is well-established. When the intersection of two normal extensions is the base field, the Galois group of their compositum is the direct product of their individual Galois groups. This justifies that the Galois group $G$ of the splitting field $K$ is $S_5 \\times C_2$.\n*   The possible degrees of normal sub-extensions correspond to the indices of the normal subgroups of the Galois group $G$. My analysis of the normal subgroups of $G = S_5 \\times C_2$ and their indices appears sound. The list of normal subgroups is based on Goursat's theorem for subgroups of a direct product, specialized to normal subgroups. The calculation of the indices gives the possible degrees.\n\nThe steps taken are:\n1.  The polynomial was factored as $f(x) = (x^2 - 2)(x^5 - 9x + 3)$.\n2.  The splitting field $K$ is the compositum of the splitting fields of the two factors: $K_g = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ and $K_h$, the splitting field of $h(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$.\n3.  The Galois group of $K_g/\\mathbb{Q}$ is $C_2$. The Galois group of $K_h/\\mathbb{Q}$ is $S_5$.\n4.  The intersection of these fields is $\\mathbb{Q}$, as one is a real quadratic field and the only quadratic subfield of the other is imaginary.\n5.  Therefore, the Galois group of $K/\\mathbb{Q}$ is $G \\cong S_5 \\times C_2$, which has order 240.\n6.  The proper normal sub-extensions $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ (where $\\mathbb{Q} \\subsetneq L \\subsetneq K$) correspond to the non-trivial, proper normal subgroups of $G$.\n7.  The normal subgroups of $S_5 \\times C_2$ are $\\{e\\} \\times C_2$, $A_5 \\times \\{e\\}$, $A_5 \\times C_2$, $S_5 \\times \\{e\\}$, and a \"skew\" normal subgroup $N_{skew}$ of order 120.\n8.  The degrees of the corresponding sub-extensions are the indices of these subgroups in $G$.\n    *   Index of $\\{e\\} \\times C_2$ is $240/2 = 120$.\n    *   Index of $A_5 \\times \\{e\\}$ is $240/60 = 4$.\n    *   Index of $A_5 \\times C_2$ is $240/120 = 2$.\n    *   Index of $S_5 \\times \\{e\\}$ is $240/120 = 2$.\n    *   Index of $N_{skew}$ is $240/120 = 2$.\n\nThe distinct possible degrees are therefore 2, 4, and 120.\n\nFinal check of the question: \"List all the possible degrees of normal field extensions $L / \\mathbb{Q}$ such that $\\mathbb{Q} \\subsetneq L \\subsetneq K$.\" My derived set of degrees satisfies this.\n\n<<<The possible degrees are 2, 4, and 120.>>>"
