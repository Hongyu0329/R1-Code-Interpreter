The second coefficient in the heat kernel expansion of the spectral action for a massless gauged Dirac spinor field is `a_1 = -\frac{d_s}{12(4\pi)^{d/2}} \int_M R \sqrt{g} d^dx`, where `d` is the spacetime dimension, `d_s` is the dimension of the spinor representation, `R` is the scalar curvature, and the integral is taken over the spacetime manifold `M`.
