    "To represent the number $\\frac{13}{16}$ in Red-Blue Hackenbush, we first express the fraction in binary form.\n\nThe value $\\frac{13}{16}$ is equivalent to the decimal 0.8125. To convert this to binary:\n*   0.8125 × 2 = 1.625 (the integer part is 1)\n*   0.625 × 2 = 1.25 (the integer part is 1)\n*   0.25 × 2 = 0.5 (the integer part is 0)\n*   0.5 × 2 = 1.0 (the integer part is 1)\n\nReading the integer parts from top to bottom, the binary representation of $\\frac{13}{16}$ is 0.1101.\n\nIn Red-Blue Hackenbush, for positive dyadic rationals (fractions with a denominator that is a power of 2), the sequence of red and blue pieces corresponds to the binary digits following the decimal point. A blue piece corresponds to a '1' and a red piece corresponds to a '0'. The position of the piece on the stalk determines its value as a power of $\\frac{1}{2}$.,\n\nThe binary representation 0.1101 is interpreted as follows:\n*   The first digit, '1', corresponds to a **blue** piece, representing $\\frac{1}{2}$.\n*   The second digit, '1', corresponds to a **blue** piece, representing $\\frac{1}{4}$.\n*   The third digit, '0', corresponds to a **red** piece, representing a value of 0 for that position ($\\frac{0}{8}$).\n*   The fourth digit, '1', corresponds to a **blue** piece, representing $\\frac{1}{16}$.\n\nThe total value is $\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{0}{8} + \\frac{1}{16} = \\frac{8}{16} + \\frac{4}{16} + \\frac{1}{16} = \\frac{13}{16}$.\n\nThe Hackenbush stalk, from the ground up, would be Blue-Blue-Red-Blue. This representation requires a total of 4 pieces.\n\nTherefore, 3 blue pieces and 1 red piece are needed, for a total of 4 pieces.\n\n<<<4>>>"
