    "A power subgroup is defined as a cyclic subgroup, which is a subgroup generated by a single element of the group. The question asks for the number of distinct cyclic subgroups in the semidihedral group of order 512.\n\nThe semidihedral group of order 2ⁿ, denoted as SD₂ₙ, is defined by the presentation:\nSD₂ₙ = ⟨r, s | r²ⁿ⁻¹ = s² = 1, srs = r²ⁿ⁻²⁻¹⟩\n\nFor the semidihedral group of size 512, we have 2ⁿ = 512, which means n=9. The group SD₅₁₂ has the following structure:\n*   A cyclic subgroup ⟨r⟩ of order 2⁸ = 256.\n*   A set of 256 elements of the form srⁱ, where 0 ≤ i < 256.\n\nTo find the number of power subgroups, we count the number of distinct cyclic subgroups.\n\n1.  **Cyclic subgroups within ⟨r⟩**: The subgroup ⟨r⟩ is a cyclic group of order 256. The number of distinct subgroups of a cyclic group of order *m* is equal to the number of divisors of *m*, denoted τ(*m*). For *m* = 256 = 2⁸, the number of divisors is τ(2⁸) = 8 + 1 = 9. These are the subgroups generated by r, r², r⁴, r⁸, r¹⁶, r³², r⁶⁴, r¹²⁸, and the identity element r²⁵⁶.\n\n2.  **Cyclic subgroups generated by elements of the form srⁱ**:\n    *   **Case 1: `i` is even.** Let `i = 2j`, where 0 ≤ j < 128. The order of these elements is 2. Each of these 128 elements generates a distinct cyclic subgroup of order 2. These subgroups are new because their non-identity element is not a power of `r`. This gives 128 distinct subgroups.\n    *   **Case 2: `i` is odd.** The order of these elements is 4. An element `srⁱ` generates a cyclic subgroup `⟨srⁱ⟩ = {e, srⁱ, r¹²⁸, srⁱ⁺¹²⁸}`. Two such elements, `srⁱ` and `srʲ` (with `i` and `j` being odd), generate the same subgroup if and only if `j` is equivalent to `i` or `i+128` modulo 256. This means the 128 elements with odd `i` form 64 pairs, with each pair generating the same subgroup. This results in 64 distinct cyclic subgroups of order 4.\n\nThe total number of power subgroups is the sum of the counts from these distinct categories:\nTotal Subgroups = (Subgroups from ⟨r⟩) + (Subgroups from srⁱ with i even) + (Subgroups from srⁱ with i odd)\nTotal Subgroups = 9 + 128 + 64 = 201.\n\nThis result can also be obtained using the general formula for the number of cyclic subgroups of the semidihedral group SD₂ₙ, which is n + 2ⁿ⁻² + 2ⁿ⁻³. For n=9, this yields:\n9 + 2⁹⁻² + 2⁹⁻³ = 9 + 2⁷ + 2⁶ = 9 + 128 + 64 = 201.\n\n<<<201>>>"
