    "The group in question is $G = (\\mathbb{Z}/49\\mathbb{Z})^{2024}$. We are looking for the smallest possible size of a set $A \\subset G$ with the property that for every cyclic subgroup $H$ of $G$, the intersection $A \\cap H$ is non-empty.\n\nLet's denote the set of all cyclic subgroups of $G$ by $\\mathcal{C}$. The condition on the set $A$ can be stated as:\n$\\forall H \\in \\mathcal{C}, A \\cap H \\neq \\emptyset$.\n\nA cyclic subgroup is a subgroup generated by a single element of the group. Let's consider the possible cyclic subgroups of $G$. The orders of elements in $\\mathbb{Z}/49\\mathbb{Z}$ are 1, 7, and 49. Consequently, the orders of elements in $G$ can be 1, 7, or 49. This leads to cyclic subgroups of order 1, 7, or 49.\n\n1.  **Cyclic subgroup of order 1:** The identity element $0 \\in G$ generates the trivial subgroup, which is $\\{0\\}$. This is a cyclic subgroup, denoted as $H_0 = \\langle 0 \\rangle = \\{0\\}$. The trivial group is considered a cyclic group.\n\nThe condition that $A$ must intersect every cyclic subgroup applies to $H_0$ as well. Thus, we must have:\n$A \\cap H_0 \\neq \\emptyset$\n$A \\cap \\{0\\} \\neq \\emptyset$\n\nThis implies that the element $0$ must be a member of the set $A$. Therefore, any valid set $A$ must contain the identity element, so the minimum size of $A$ is at least 1.\n\n2.  **Checking if the set A = {0} works:** Now, let's consider the set $A = \\{0\\}$, which has a size of 1. We need to check if this set satisfies the condition for all cyclic subgroups of $G$.\n\nLet $H$ be an arbitrary cyclic subgroup of $G$. By the definition of a subgroup, every subgroup of $G$ must contain the identity element, $0$. Therefore, for any cyclic subgroup $H$ (whether of order 1, 7, or 49), it is true that $0 \\in H$.\n\nNow, let's look at the intersection of our proposed set $A=\\{0\\}$ with any cyclic subgroup $H$:\n$A \\cap H = \\{0\\} \\cap H = \\{0\\}$\n\nSince $\\{0\\}$ is a non-empty set, the intersection is non-empty for every cyclic subgroup $H$ of $G$.\n\nConclusion: The set $A = \\{0\\}$ satisfies the condition that it intersects every cyclic subgroup of $G$. The size of this set is 1. Since we have already established that any valid set $A$ must have a size of at least 1, the smallest possible size for $A$ is exactly 1.\n\n"
