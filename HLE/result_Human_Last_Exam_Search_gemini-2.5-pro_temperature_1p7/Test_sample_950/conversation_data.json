    "The problem asks for the rank of the torsion subgroup of the integral cohomology ring of the space of 3-subspaces of $\\mathbb{R}^5$. This space is the real Grassmannian manifold $G(3, 5)$. The dimension of this manifold is $k(n-k) = 3(5-3) = 6$.\n\nFirst, we clarify the meaning of \"rank of the torsion subgroup\". For a finitely generated abelian group $A$, its torsion subgroup $T(A)$ consists of all elements of finite order. As a finite abelian group, the rank of $T(A)$ (as a $\\mathbb{Z}$-module) is 0. However, in this context, \"rank\" typically refers to the dimension of the torsion subgroup when viewed as a vector space over a finite field. For real Grassmannians, all torsion in integral cohomology is 2-torsion, meaning every torsion element has order 2. Thus, the torsion subgroup is a vector space over $\\mathbb{F}_2 = \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$, and the question is asking for the dimension of this vector space. This is the sum of the $\\mathbb{F}_2$-dimensions of the torsion part of each cohomology group $H^i(G(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\nThe integral cohomology groups $H^i(X; \\mathbb{Z})$ can be determined from the integral homology groups $H_i(X; \\mathbb{Z})$ using the Universal Coefficient Theorem (UCT). The homology groups themselves can be constrained by comparing the homology with $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$ coefficients and with $\\mathbb{Q}$ coefficients.\n\n1.  **Cohomology with $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$ coefficients:** The Betti numbers for $H_*(G(k,n); \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})$, denoted $b_i(\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})$, are given by the number of partitions of $i$ into at most $k$ parts, each of size at most $n-k$. For $G(3,5)$, we have $k=3$ and $n-k=2$. (Note: $G(3,5)$ is homeomorphic to $G(2,5)$). Let's use $k=2, n-k=3$. The $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$-Betti numbers are:\n    *   $b_0(\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})=1$: partition of 0, (0)\n    *   $b_1(\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})=1$: partition of 1, (1)\n    *   $b_2(\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})=2$: partitions of 2, (2), (1,1)\n    *   $b_3(\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})=2$: partitions of 3, (3), (2,1)\n    *   $b_4(\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})=2$: partitions of 4, (3,1), (2,2)\n    *   $b_5(\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})=1$: partition of 5, (3,2)\n    *   $b_6(\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})=1$: partition of 6, (3,3)\n\n2.  **Cohomology with $\\mathbb{Q}$ coefficients:** For a real Grassmannian $G(k, n)$ where $n$ is odd, the rational cohomology is trivial except in degree 0. Thus, the rational Betti numbers are $b_0(\\mathbb{Q})=1$ and $b_i(\\mathbb{Q})=0$ for $i > 0$.\n\n3.  **Integral Homology:** Let $t_i = \\dim_{\\mathbb{F}_2} \\text{Tors}(H_i(G(3,5);\\mathbb{Z}))$. The Universal Coefficient Theorem for homology provides the relation: $b_i(\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}) = b_i(\\mathbb{Q}) + t_i + t_{i-1}$. We can solve for $t_i$ recursively:\n    *   $i=0: 1 = 1 + t_0 + 0 \\implies t_0 = 0$.\n    *   $i=1: 1 = 0 + t_1 + t_0 \\implies t_1 = 1$.\n    *   $i=2: 2 = 0 + t_2 + t_1 \\implies 2 = t_2 + 1 \\implies t_2 = 1$.\n    *   $i=3: 2 = 0 + t_3 + t_2 \\implies 2 = t_3 + 1 \\implies t_3 = 1$.\n    *   $i=4: 2 = 0 + t_4 + t_3 \\implies 2 = t_4 + 1 \\implies t_4 = 1$.\n    *   $i=5: 1 = 0 + t_5 + t_4 \\implies 1 = t_5 + 1 \\implies t_5 = 0$.\n    *   $i=6: 1 = 0 + t_6 + t_5 \\implies 1 = t_6 + 0 \\implies t_6 = 1$.\n    So, the integral homology groups are:\n    $H_0=\\mathbb{Z}$, $H_1=\\mathbb{Z}_2$, $H_2=\\mathbb{Z}_2$, $H_3=\\mathbb{Z}_2$, $H_4=\\mathbb{Z}_2$, $H_5=0$, $H_6=\\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n\n4.  **Integral Cohomology:** Now we apply the UCT for cohomology, $H^i(X; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\text{Hom}(H_i(X; \\mathbb{Z}), \\mathbb{Z}) \\oplus \\text{Ext}^1(H_{i-1}(X; \\mathbb{Z}), \\mathbb{Z})$.\n    *   $T(H^0): \\text{rank}=0$.\n    *   $T(H^1): \\text{rank}=0$.\n    *   $T(H^2): \\text{Ext}^1(H_1, \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}_2$. Rank is 1.\n    *   $T(H^3): \\text{Ext}^1(H_2, \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}_2$. Rank is 1.\n    *   $T(H^4): \\text{Ext}^1(H_3, \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}_2$. Rank is 1.\n    *   $T(H^5): \\text{Ext}^1(H_4, \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}_2$. Rank is 1.\n    *   $G(3,5)$ is a non-orientable 6-manifold, and for such a manifold, the top integral cohomology group is $H^6(G(3,5); \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$. The rank of this torsion group is 1.\n\nSumming the ranks of the torsion subgroups of each cohomology group:\n$0 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5$.\n\nThe rank of the torsion subgroup of the integral cohomology ring of the space of $3$-subspaces of $\\mathbb{R}^5$ is 5.\n\n<<<5>>>"
