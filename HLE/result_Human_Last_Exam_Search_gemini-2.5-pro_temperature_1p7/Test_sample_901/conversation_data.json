    "The reaction of (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane with potassium tert-butoxide in tert-butyl alcohol results in an E2 elimination reaction. The major product of this reaction is 3-methylcyclohexene.\n\nHere is a step-by-step explanation of the reaction:\n1.  **Substrate and Reagent Analysis**: The substrate is (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane. The stereochemistry (1S,2R) indicates that the bromine atom and the methyl group are *cis* to each other. The reagent is potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), which is a strong, sterically hindered (bulky) base. These conditions strongly favor an E2 (bimolecular elimination) reaction mechanism.\n\n2.  **Conformational Requirement for E2 Reaction**: The E2 reaction has a strict stereochemical requirement: the leaving group (bromine) and the proton being removed must be in an anti-periplanar arrangement. In a cyclohexane ring, this means both groups must be in axial positions, one pointing up and the other down.\n\n3.  **Conformational Analysis**: As a *cis*-1,2-disubstituted cyclohexane, (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane exists as an equilibrium between two chair conformations:\n    *   **Conformer A**: Bromine is equatorial, and the methyl group is axial.\n    *   **Conformer B**: Bromine is axial, and the methyl group is equatorial.\n\n    The conformer with the bulky methyl group in the equatorial position (Conformer B) is significantly more stable and will be the predominant conformation at equilibrium. The E2 reaction must proceed from this conformer because it is the only one where the bromine leaving group is in the required axial position.\n\n4.  **Identification of Anti-periplanar Protons**: In the reactive conformer (Br axial, CH₃ equatorial), we look for axial protons on the adjacent carbons (β-carbons), C2 and C6.\n    *   **At C2**: The carbon bearing the methyl group. Since the methyl group is equatorial, the hydrogen on C2 is axial. This axial hydrogen is anti-periplanar to the axial bromine.\n    *   **At C6**: This carbon has two hydrogens, one of which is axial and therefore anti-periplanar to the axial bromine.\n\n5.  **Regioselectivity (Product Determination)**: Since there are anti-periplanar protons on both C2 and C6, two different alkene products are possible:\n    *   **Zaitsev Product**: Removal of the proton from C2 would lead to the formation of 1-methylcyclohexene, which is a more substituted (trisubstituted) and more stable alkene.\n    *   **Hofmann Product**: Removal of the proton from C6 would lead to the formation of 3-methylcyclohexene, a less substituted (disubstituted) and less stable alkene.\n\n    The choice between these two products is determined by the base. Potassium tert-butoxide is a bulky base. Due to its large size, it experiences steric hindrance when trying to abstract the proton from the more substituted C2, which is shielded by the methyl group. The base can more easily access the less hindered proton on C6. Therefore, with a bulky base like potassium tert-butoxide, the Hofmann product is favored.\n\nBased on this analysis, the major product of the reaction is 3-methylcyclohexene.\n\n<<<3-methylcyclohexene>>>"
