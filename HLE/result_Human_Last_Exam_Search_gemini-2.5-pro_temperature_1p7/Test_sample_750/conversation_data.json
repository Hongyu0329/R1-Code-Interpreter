    "To solve the complex equation $z \\cdot i = i^z$, we must consider that the term $i^z$ is multi-valued. The definition of the complex exponentiation is $a^b = e^{b \\log a}$, where $\\log a$ is the multi-valued complex logarithm.\n\nThe complex logarithm of $i$ is given by:\n$\\log(i) = \\ln|i| + i \\arg(i) = \\ln(1) + i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi) = i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)$ for any integer $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\nLet's define $C_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi$.\n\nThe equation $z \\cdot i = i^z$ means that for a given $z$, it must be equal to at least one of the values of $i^z$. Therefore, for a given solution $z$, there must exist an integer $k$ such that:\n$z \\cdot i = e^{z \\log(i)} = e^{z \\cdot iC_k}$\n\nTo solve for $z$, we can rearrange the equation. Let $w = z \\cdot i$. The equation becomes $w = e^{w C_k}$. We can solve this equation for $w$ using the Lambert W function, which is defined as the solution to the equation $X e^X = A$, given by $X = W(A)$.\n\nLet's manipulate the equation to fit the form of the Lambert W function:\n$w = e^{w C_k}$\n$w e^{-w C_k} = 1$\nMultiply by $-C_k$:\n$-w C_k e^{-w C_k} = -C_k$\nLet $X = -w C_k$. The equation becomes:\n$X e^X = -C_k$\nBy the definition of the Lambert W function, the solution for $X$ is $X = W(-C_k)$. Since the Lambert W function is multi-valued, its different branches are denoted by an integer index $m$, so $X = W_m(-C_k)$.\n\nSubstituting back for $X$:\n$-w C_k = W_m(-C_k)$\n$w = -\\frac{W_m(-C_k)}{C_k}$\nSince we defined $w = z \\cdot i$, we have $z = \\frac{w}{i}$:\n$z = -\\frac{W_m(-C_k)}{i C_k} = \\frac{i W_m(-C_k)}{C_k}$\n\nThe set of all solutions for $z$ in the complex plane is given by the formula:\n$z_{k,m} = \\frac{i \\cdot W_m(-(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi))}{(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)}$\nfor all integers $k, m \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nThis general formula encompasses several types of solutions:\n\n1.  **Real Solutions**: The equation has two real solutions, $z=1$ and $z=-1$.\n    *   For $z=1$: $1 \\cdot i = i$ and $i^1 = i$. The equation holds. This solution is found from the general formula for any $k$ by choosing the appropriate branch $m$. For instance, for $k=0$, we need $1 = \\frac{i W_m(-\\pi/2)}{\\pi/2}$, which means $W_m(-\\pi/2) = -i\\pi/2$. This is a valid value for a specific branch of the Lambert W function.\n    *   For $z=-1$: $(-1) \\cdot i = -i$ and $i^{-1} = \\frac{1}{i} = -i$. The equation holds. This solution is also found from the general formula. For $k=0$, we need $-1 = \\frac{i W_m(-\\pi/2)}{\\pi/2}$, which means $W_m(-\\pi/2) = i\\pi/2$.\n\n2.  **Purely Imaginary Solutions**: There is an infinite series of purely imaginary solutions. A solution $z=iy$ is purely imaginary if $W_m(-C_k)$ is a real number, which occurs only if the argument $-C_k$ is greater than or equal to $-1/e$.\n    $C_k = (\\frac{1}{2} + 2k)\\pi \\le 1/e$\n    $2k + \\frac{1}{2} \\le \\frac{1}{e\\pi}$\n    $2k \\le \\frac{1}{e\\pi} - \\frac{1}{2} \\approx 0.117 - 0.5 = -0.383$\n    $k \\le -0.1915$\n    This condition is met for any integer $k \\le -1$. For these values of $k$, $C_k$ is negative, so $-C_k$ is positive. For a positive argument, the Lambert W function has a real value on its principal branch ($m=0$). Thus, for each integer $k \\le -1$, there is one purely imaginary solution:\n    $z_k = i \\frac{W_0(-(\\frac{\\pi}{2}+2k\\pi))}{(\\frac{\\pi}{2}+2k\\pi)}$\n\n3.  **Complex Solutions**: For all other combinations of integers $k$ and $m$, we obtain complex solutions.\n    *   If $k \\ge 0$, then $-C_k \\le -\\pi/2 < -1/e$. In this case, $W_m(-C_k)$ is complex for all branches $m$.\n    *   If $k \\le -1$, the non-principal branches ($m \\ne 0$) of $W_m(-C_k)$ are also complex.\n\nThus, all solutions to the equation $z\\cdot i = i^z$ are described by the set:\n$\\{ z_{k,m} = \\frac{i \\cdot W_m(-C_k)}{C_k} \\mid k, m \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\}$, where $C_k = (\\frac{1}{2}+2k)\\pi$.\n\n<<<The set of all solutions for $z \\in \\mathbb{C}$ is given by $z_{k,m} = \\frac{i \\cdot W_m(-(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi))}{(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)}$ for any integers $k$ and $m$, where $W_m$ denotes the $m$-th branch of the Lambert W function. This set includes the real solutions $z=1$ and $z=-1$, an infinite series of purely imaginary solutions, and an infinite number of other complex solutions.>>>"
