The set of all solutions for $z \in \mathbb{C}$ is given by $z_{k,m} = \frac{i \cdot W_m(-(\frac{\pi}{2} + 2k\pi))}{(\frac{\pi}{2} + 2k\pi)}$ for any integers $k$ and $m$, where $W_m$ denotes the $m$-th branch of the Lambert W function. This set includes the real solutions $z=1$ and $z=-1$, an infinite series of purely imaginary solutions, and an infinite number of other complex solutions.
