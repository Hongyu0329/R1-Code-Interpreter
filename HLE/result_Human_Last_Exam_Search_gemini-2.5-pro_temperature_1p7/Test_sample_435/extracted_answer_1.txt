Manufacturing CAR T cells with interleukin-15 (IL-15) is predicted to result in a more potent and sustained release of anti-tumor cytokines, such as IFN-γ and TNF-α, upon antigen stimulation compared to CAR T cells manufactured without IL-15. This is attributed to IL-15's role in promoting a less differentiated, more persistent memory phenotype. While enhancing effector cytokine production, some evidence suggests that in certain contexts, this manufacturing method might lead to a more controlled cytokine profile, potentially mitigating the risk of severe Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS). However, this is distinct from CAR T cells engineered to continuously secrete IL-15, which have been associated with a higher CRS risk.
