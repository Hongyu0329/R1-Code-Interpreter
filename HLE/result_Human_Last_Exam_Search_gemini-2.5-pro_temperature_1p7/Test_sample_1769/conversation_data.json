    "Without the linguistic influence of the Norse invaders between the 7th and 12th centuries, the Modern English word for \"sister\" would almost certainly not be \"sister.\" The current word is a hybrid, developed from the Old English word being reshaped by the Old Norse equivalent.\n\nThe native Anglo-Saxon, or Old English, word for a female sibling was **sweostor**. There were also dialectal variants such as *swuster* and the Northumbrian *soester*. The word comes from a common Proto-Germanic root, **swestr-*, which is why it resembles the Old Norse *systir* as well as the Modern German *Schwester* and Dutch *zuster*.\n\nThe arrival of Vikings and subsequent settlement in areas of England known as the Danelaw led to a close mixing of Old English and Old Norse speakers. Because the two languages were closely related, words were often blended or the Norse version, with its harder 'sk' and 'k' sounds, replaced the English one (e.g., *skirt* instead of *shirt* from the same root).\n\nIn the case of \"sister,\" the 'i' vowel sound and the retention of the 's' sound (instead of becoming 'sh') are attributed to the influence of the Old Norse *systir*. Without this Norse interaction, the word *sweostor* would have followed a purely English phonological development.\n\nWhile it is impossible to be certain, by tracing the evolution of similar Old English words, the likely Modern English word would be **Suster**.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n*   The initial *sweo-* diphthong in Old English often evolved. For example, *sweord* became \"sword.\" This suggests *sweostor* may have become *swoster*.\n*   The variant *swuster* already existed in Old English, which could have smoothed to *suster* over time, with the 'u' pronounced as in \"put\" or \"cup\".\n*   The second, unstressed vowel in *-stor* would likely have been reduced to a schwa sound (/ə/), a very common process in the development of English, resulting in the modern \"-er\" ending.\n\nThis trajectory suggests a modern form spelled **Suster** and pronounced roughly as /ˈsʌstər/.\n\n<<<Suster>>>"
