  "question": "In a recent excavation of an ancient Chinese tomb, people found two books called Ching and Shu. The Ching contains exactly 9999 symbols of yinyang-wuxing, such as yin-water or yang-fire. The Shu contains around 3000 ancient Chinese characters. Using advanced language modeling and computer vision technologies, people discover that the Shu is written with only 120 most common Chinese characters at that time. The computer vision tool can recognize such a character in 12 ms. Computation time for each operation on integers and floats is 10 ns and 30 ns, respectively.\n\nPeople believe that the Ching has a secret message encrypted with its symbols. This message is also written using the letters in the Shu. What is the max length of this message?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>.",

    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the logic to find the maximum length of the secret message:\n\n1.  **Determine the number of unique symbols in the Ching.**\n    The Ching's symbols are described as \"yinyang-wuxing.\"\n    *   \"Yinyang\" has two possibilities: yin and yang.\n    *   \"Wuxing\" refers to the five Chinese elements: water, fire, wood, metal, and earth.\n    *   Therefore, the total number of unique symbols is the product of the possibilities: 2 (yin/yang) \\* 5 (elements) = 10 unique symbols.\n\n2.  **Determine the size of the message's alphabet.**\n    The problem states that the secret message is written using the letters found in the Shu. The Shu, in turn, is written using \"120 most common Chinese characters.\" This means the alphabet for the secret message consists of 120 distinct characters that need to be encoded.\n\n3.  **Calculate the number of Ching symbols needed to encode one character.**\n    To encode 120 different characters using a set of 10 unique symbols, we need to find the smallest number of symbols (let's call this length `L`) that can create at least 120 unique combinations. This is calculated by `10^L â‰¥ 120`.\n    *   If `L=1`, we have `10^1 = 10` combinations, which is not enough.\n    *   If `L=2`, we have `10^2 = 100` combinations, which is still not enough.\n    *   If `L=3`, we have `10^3 = 1000` combinations. This is more than enough to assign a unique 3-symbol code to each of the 120 characters.\n    Therefore, a minimum of 3 symbols from the Ching are required to represent one character of the secret message.\n\n4.  **Calculate the maximum length of the message.**\n    The Ching contains a total of 9999 symbols. Since each character of the secret message requires 3 symbols for its encoding, the maximum length of the message is the total number of symbols divided by the number of symbols per character.\n    *   Maximum Message Length = 9999 symbols / 3 symbols per character = 3333 characters.\n\nThe other information, such as the number of characters in the Shu (around 3000) and the various computation and recognition times (12 ms, 10 ns, 30 ns), is not relevant to calculating the maximum possible length of the encrypted message.\n\n<<<3333>>>"
