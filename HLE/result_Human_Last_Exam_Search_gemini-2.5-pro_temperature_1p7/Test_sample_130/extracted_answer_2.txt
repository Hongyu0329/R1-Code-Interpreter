As the local median operator is applied iteratively to a binary image, the edges will progressively smooth out. Specifically, convex corners will be eroded and concave corners will be filled. This process is analogous to motion by mean curvature, causing shapes to become more convex and rounded. Over an infinite number of applications, small or thin shapes will be eliminated entirely, and larger shapes will shrink, potentially disappearing completely. The image will eventually converge to a "root signal" or a fixed point, which is an image consisting of only large, smooth, convex objects, or a completely uniform image (all black or all white).
