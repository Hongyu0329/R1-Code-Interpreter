    "The problem asks for the determination of \\(av_{333}^3(1324)\\), which represents the number of permutations of length 333 that avoid the pattern 1324 and have exactly 3 inversions.\n\nAn inversion in a permutation is a pair of indices (i, j) such that i < j and the corresponding values in the permutation \\(\\sigma_i > \\sigma_j\\). A permutation avoids the pattern 1324 if there are no indices i < j < k < l such that \\(\\sigma_i < \\sigma_k < \\sigma_j < \\sigma_l\\).\n\nThe enumeration of 1324-avoiding permutations is a known difficult problem in combinatorics. However, for a fixed small number of inversions, formulas have been developed. For \\(k\\) inversions, the number of such permutations, denoted as \\(av_n^k(1324)\\), becomes a polynomial in \\(n\\) for sufficiently large \\(n\\).\n\nFor the case of \\(k=3\\) inversions, the number of 1324-avoiding permutations of length \\(n\\) where \\(n \\ge 4\\) is given by the formula:\n\\(av_n^3(1324) = \\binom{n-1}{2} + 1\\)\n\nIn this specific problem, we have \\(n=333\\) and \\(k=3\\). Since \\(333 \\ge 4\\), this formula can be applied directly.\n\nFirst, we calculate the binomial coefficient \\(\\binom{332}{2}\\):\n\\(\\binom{332}{2} = \\frac{332 \\times (332-1)}{2 \\times 1} = \\frac{332 \\times 331}{2}\\)\n\\(\\binom{332}{2} = 166 \\times 331\\)\n\\(\\binom{332}{2} = 54946\\)\n\nNext, we add 1 to this result as per the formula:\n\\(av_{333}^3(1324) = 54946 + 1 = 54947\\)\n\nTherefore, the number of 1324-avoiding permutations of length 333 with exactly 3 inversions is 54,947.\n\n<<<54947>>>"
