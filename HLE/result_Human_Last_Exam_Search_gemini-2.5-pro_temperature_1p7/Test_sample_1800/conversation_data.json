    "Determining the ideal nickel-to-cerium (Ni/Ce) ratio in Ni-Ceria nanoparticles is crucial for maximizing their catalytic performance. However, a single ideal ratio does not exist; instead, the optimal proportion is highly dependent on the specific application—be it the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction or water splitting—as well as the catalyst's specific composition and structure.\n\n### Water Gas Shift (WGS) Reaction\n\nFor the WGS reaction, which converts carbon monoxide and water to carbon dioxide and hydrogen, the optimal Ni/Ce ratio tends to favor a lower nickel content. The goal is to achieve high CO conversion while often preventing side reactions like methanation.\n\nSeveral studies point to an effective range for nickel content:\n*   A study on Ni/La-doped ceria catalysts for the reverse WGS reaction found that an optimum Ni proportion is around **7% molar**. While a higher loading of 10% molar gave similar results, a lower loading of 1% led to faster deactivation of the catalyst.\n*   For Ni/CeO₂ catalysts, research has shown that catalysts with **10 wt% and 12.5 wt% Ni** exhibit nearly identical and high levels of CO conversion at 400°C, suggesting a performance plateau in this range.\n*   In a more complex system involving tungsten, a Ni-W-Ce mixed oxide catalyst with a composition of **Ni₀.₂W₀.₁Ce₀.₇O₂** (a Ni/Ce atomic ratio of roughly 0.29) was identified as having the highest catalytic activity.\n*   Indicating that the nickel dispersion is key, another study showed that a catalyst with just **2.5 atomic % Ni** atomically dispersed in ceria was highly active and completely suppressed methane formation.\n*   Other effective catalysts have been formulated with nickel loadings of **4 wt% to 5 wt%** on ceria-based supports, often enhanced with other elements like gadolinium or rhenium.\n\n### Water Splitting (WS)\n\nIn contrast to the WGS reaction, catalysts designed for water splitting, which involves separating water into hydrogen and oxygen through the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER) and Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER), often benefit from a higher nickel content.\n\nThe optimal Ni/Ce ratio for water splitting varies depending on the targeted half-reaction:\n*   **Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER)**: For electrocatalysts composed of NiyCe100-yOx, compositions of **Ni₅₀Ce₅₀Oₓ (a 1:1 Ni/Ce atomic ratio)** and **Ni₇₅Ce₂₅Oₓ (a 3:1 Ni/Ce ratio)** showed the highest activity. The high performance was linked to a greater concentration of oxygen vacancies. The Ni₇₅Ce₂₅Oₓ catalyst was also highlighted for its excellent long-term stability.\n*   **Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER)**: In a study on Ni₃N-CeO₂ catalysts, the best performance for the HER was achieved with a **Ce/Ni molar ratio of 2:1** (approximately 33.3% Ni to 66.7% Ce). This catalyst also demonstrated high efficiency for the overall water splitting process.\n\nIn conclusion, the ideal Ni/Ce ratio is a function of the target reaction and the overall catalyst design. For the **WGS reaction**, a lower nickel content, typically in the range of **2.5 at% to 12.5 wt%**, is generally favored. For **water splitting**, a significantly higher nickel content is beneficial, with optimal atomic ratios of Ni to Ce ranging from **1:2 to 3:1** depending on the catalyst formulation and the specific electrochemical half-reaction being optimized.\n\n<<<For the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction, the optimal Ni content is generally in the range of 2.5 atomic % to 12.5 wt%. For water splitting, the optimal Ni/Ce atomic ratio is higher, ranging from 1:2 to 3:1.>>>"
