    "In the field of nuclear criticality, the generalized pair correlation function describes the probability of finding two neutrons at specific positions and times. The space-time, double Fourier transform of this function is commonly known as the **dynamic structure factor**, often denoted as *S(q,ω)*.\n\nThis concept, while fundamental in condensed matter physics and neutron scattering, is also applied within the nuclear engineering and physics community. The dynamic structure factor provides information about the collective excitations and correlations within the neutron population of a nuclear system. It is directly related to the double-differential scattering cross-section, which is a key parameter in neutron transport calculations and reactor analysis.\n\nWithin the nuclear data community, the dynamic structure factor is closely related to the **thermal scattering law**, often denoted as *S(α,β)*, which is used to describe the scattering of thermal neutrons in materials. The parameters α and β are dimensionless variables representing momentum and energy transfer, respectively, and are directly proportional to the wavevector *q* and frequency *ω* of the dynamic structure factor.\n\nNoise analysis techniques in nuclear criticality, such as the **Feynman-alpha** and **Rossi-alpha** methods, are also intimately related to the pair correlation function. These methods measure the time-correlated fluctuations in the neutron population to infer critical parameters of the system. Specifically, the Rossi-alpha method directly measures the time correlation between neutron detection events, which is a component of the generalized pair correlation function. The Feynman-alpha method, which calculates the variance-to-mean ratio of neutron counts, is theoretically derived from the same underlying correlation principles.\n\n<<<dynamic structure factor>>>"
