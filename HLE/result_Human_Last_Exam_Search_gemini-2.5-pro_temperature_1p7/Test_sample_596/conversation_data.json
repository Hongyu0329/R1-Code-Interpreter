    "I have gathered definitions for \"higher dimensional rooted forests\", \"standard triangulation of the Möbius band\", and \"simplicial collapse\".\n\nFrom the search results, I understand that:\n- A **higher dimensional rooted forest** `(F, R)` of a simplicial complex `K` is a pair where `F` is a subcomplex of `K` (the forest) and `R` is a subcomplex of `F` (the root). `F` must satisfy certain acyclicity conditions.\n- A **simplicial collapse** of a complex `K` is a sequence of removing pairs of simplices (`σ`, `τ`) where `τ` is a free face of `σ`. A complex is collapsible if it can be reduced to a single vertex.\n- A **standard triangulation of the Möbius band** can be constructed from a rectangle by identifying two opposite sides with a twist. There are different minimal triangulations, for example, one with 5 vertices and one with 6 vertices. The Möbius strip is non-orientable.\n\nThe core of the question is to count the number of rooted forests `(F,R)` where the forest `F` does *not* simplicially collapse onto the root `R`.\n\nThe literature points to a connection between higher dimensional forests and discrete Morse theory. Specifically, a rooted forest `(F, R)` corresponds to a discrete gradient vector field. The question of whether `F` collapses to `R` is a question about the topology of the forest `F`.\n\nA key piece of information is that a simplicial complex is collapsible if and only if it is contractible (for 1-dimensional complexes, i.e., graphs) but this is not true in higher dimensions. The \"dunce hat\" is a classic example of a contractible but not collapsible 2-complex.\n\nFor the Möbius band, which is a 2-dimensional simplicial complex, a forest `F` would be a 2-dimensional subcomplex. A crucial property of the Möbius band is that it is not simply connected.\n\nA result by Bernardi and Klivans provides a generating function for rooted forests in terms of the Laplacian of the complex.\n\nHowever, the sources do not directly provide a method to count the number of non-collapsible forests. This seems to be a non-trivial problem that likely requires deep results from combinatorial algebraic topology. The number of possible forests `F` can be large, and for each, one would need to determine its collapsibility onto a given root `R`.\n\nThe problem as stated appears to be highly technical and likely cannot be answered by a simple numerical value found directly in a paper. It might be a trick question or a question that requires a very specific theorem that I have not yet found.\n\nLet's reconsider the structure of the problem. We need to find the number of pairs `(F,R)` such that `F` does not collapse to `R`.  What could prevent a collapse?  The existence of a \"hole\" or some other topological obstruction within `F` that isn't \"filled\" by the root `R`.\n\nThe papers by Bernardi and Klivans, and others, focus on spanning forests and their enumeration. The concept of a forest being \"simplicially collapsible onto the root\" is not explicitly enumerated in the provided search results.\n\nIt's possible that for *any* forest `F` on a Möbius band that contains a non-trivial cycle (which is characteristic of the Möbius band's topology), this forest will not be collapsible. A forest, by some definitions provided, is a subcomplex with trivial `d`-th homology. For a 2-dimensional complex like the Möbius band, a 2-forest would have `H_2(F) = 0`.\n\nThe papers discuss the relationship between rooted forests and discrete gradient fields, and also provide a generating function for rooted forests using the Laplacian matrix of the simplicial complex. This suggests a way to count all rooted forests. The problem is to then distinguish the collapsible ones from the non-collapsible ones.\n\nGiven the complexity of the problem and the lack of a direct answer in the search results, it's highly probable that the answer is not a simple integer that can be looked up. The question might be from a specific course or context where certain definitions or theorems are assumed. Without that specific context, a general answer is difficult.\n\nLet's assume the question is well-posed and has a definite, perhaps simple, answer. Could there be a fundamental property of all rooted forests on a Möbius band that determines their collapsibility?\n\nA key insight might be in the paper \"EXTREMAL HYPERCUTS AND SHADOWS OF SIMPLICIAL COMPLEXES\" which discusses d-collapsibility. It mentions the 5-vertex triangulation of the Möbius strip, M5, and states that for every triangle not in M5, the complex M5 U {sigma} is 2-collapsible. This hints at the collapsibility properties of complexes related to the Möbius band.\n\nThe question asks for the number of *higher dimensional* rooted forests. For a 2-dimensional complex like the Möbius band, a higher-dimensional forest is a 2-dimensional forest. A 2-forest `F` is a subcomplex of the triangulation of the Möbius band where the 2-dimensional homology group `H_2(F)` is trivial.\n\nA crucial point might be the definition of a \"forest\" and a \"root\" in this context. According to Bernardi and Klivans, a rooted forest is a pair `(F, R)` where `F` is a d-dimensional forest and `R` is a \"root\" of `F`.  A key property is that the boundary operator restricted to the forest and non-root cells is non-singular.\n\nThis is a problem that likely requires applying specific, advanced theorems from algebraic topology and combinatorics to a specific simplicial complex (the standard triangulation of the Möbius band). The provided search results give the necessary definitions and some related theorems, but do not offer a direct calculation or a final number.\n\nThe question might be a trick question where the answer is 0 or infinity, or depends on the specific triangulation. For instance, what is \"the\" standard triangulation? The results show there isn't just one. There's one with 6 vertices and 6 faces and another with 5 vertices.\n\nLet's assume the most standard, minimal triangulation. If we consider the definition of a forest, it has to be acyclic in the top dimension. The Möbius band itself has a non-trivial 1-dimensional homology, but its 2-dimensional homology is trivial. So, the entire triangulation of the Möbius band is a 2-forest.\n\nLet `K` be the standard triangulation of the Möbius band. A higher dimensional (i.e., 2-dimensional) forest `F` is a subcomplex of `K` such that its second homology group `H_2(F; Z)` is trivial. A rooted forest is a pair `(F, R)` where `R` is a subcomplex of `F`. The question is about the collapsibility of `F` onto `R`.\n\nConsider the case where `F` is the entire triangulation of the Möbius band. `K` itself is not contractible, so it cannot be collapsed to a point (or a single vertex). Whether it can be collapsed to a subcomplex `R` depends on `R`. If `R` is a \"spanning\" subcomplex in a suitable sense, then `K` might collapse to it.\n\nA paper by Joswig and Schröder (\"Higher dimensional spanning trees and their Gromov-Witten invariants\") mentions that a simplicial complex is collapsible if and only if it is simplicially isomorphic to a subcomplex of the boundary complex of a simplex. The Möbius strip is not.\n\nIt's possible that for *any* choice of `F` and `R` on a Möbius band, where `F` captures the non-trivial topology of the Möbius band (its central circle), `F` will not be collapsible to `R`.\n\nLet's reconsider the problem from a different angle. What if the answer is a property that holds for all rooted forests on the Möbius band? For example, what if *no* rooted forest `(F, R)` where `F` is \"interesting\" (e.g., spanning) collapses to its root?\n\nThe paper by Bernardi and Klivans shows a triangulated Möbius strip and mentions that the coefficient of `x^5` in the characteristic polynomial of its Laplacian is `2^2 * 1296 = 5184`. This corresponds to rooted forests with 5 edges in the root. This indicates a large number of possible rooted forests. It is infeasible to check collapsibility for each one.\n\nThe question is subtle. A forest `F` can be any subcomplex. If `F` is itself collapsible (e.g., a single simplex), it will collapse to any of its non-empty subcomplexes `R`. So there are definitely rooted forests that do collapse. The question is about those that *fail* to collapse.\n\nThis must be related to the non-orientability and the non-trivial first homology group of the Möbius band.\n\nLet's assume a \"standard triangulation\" as one that is minimal. Let this be M5 or M6 mentioned in the literature.\nIf a forest `F` is contractible, it is not guaranteed to be collapsible.\n\nLet's try to construct a non-collapsible forest. The Möbius band itself is a 2-forest (as H_2 = 0). It is not contractible (as H_1 is non-trivial), and therefore not collapsible to a point.  Is it collapsible to some root `R`?\n\nIf we take `F` to be the whole triangulation of the Möbius band, `K`. Let `R` be a single vertex in `K`. `K` does not collapse to a point, so it does not collapse to `R`. So for `F=K` and any single vertex root `R`, `(K, R)` is a rooted forest that fails to have `F` collapse to `R`. The number of vertices gives us a lower bound on the number of such rooted forests.\n\nThe question is, is there a simple characterization of *all* such non-collapsing rooted forests?\n\nThis seems to be a question from a very specific mathematical context, likely assuming a precise definition of \"higher dimensional rooted forest\" and \"standard triangulation\" that is not universally agreed upon in the provided literature. The answer is likely not a number that can be simply looked up. It's possible the answer is \"all of them\" or \"none of them\" or something similarly qualitative.\n\nGiven the constraints, I cannot compute a numerical answer. The problem likely has a trick or a very elegant solution based on a theorem I haven't found, or it's an open research problem, or a question taken out of a specific context that clarifies the definitions.\n\nHowever, if forced to provide a concrete answer based on the provided snippets, one might interpret \"higher dimensional rooted forest\" in a very specific way. If a \"forest\" must be acyclic in a strong sense (e.g., contractible), then any such forest would be collapsible (in dimension 1, this is true; in higher dimensions, this is not, as the dunce hat shows). The Möbius band is not contractible, so any forest that \"is\" the Möbius band (i.e., has the same homotopy type) will not be contractible and likely not collapsible to a point.\n\nA paper by Duval, Klivans, and Martin on \"Simplicial and Cellular Trees\" defines a d-forest as a d-complex where the columns of the boundary matrix are linearly independent. It also mentions that the triangulation of the Möbius band is itself a 2-forest. Since the Möbius band is not contractible, it is not collapsible to a point. It's plausible that it is not collapsible to any proper subcomplex either.\n\nThis suggests that for `F` being the entire triangulation of the Möbius band, for any choice of root `R`, `(F, R)` is a rooted forest where `F` does not collapse to `R`. How many such roots `R` are there? A root is a subcomplex of `F`.\n\nThis line of reasoning is getting very complex and speculative. Let's reconsider the possibility of a simpler, more direct answer. The question seems to expect a number.\n\nLet's assume a very specific context. Perhaps there's a result that says a forest collapses to its root if and only if some homological condition is met. A paper by Bernardi and Klivans relates the number of rooted forests to the determinant of the Laplacian. It's possible that collapsibility is related to the torsion of the homology groups.\n\nLet's assume the question is a trick. What could be the trick? \"Higher dimensional\" might be the key. For a 2-dimensional object, what is a \"higher\" dimensional forest? The definitions in the papers refer to d-dimensional forests of d-dimensional complexes. So, for the 2D Möbius band, we are talking about 2-dimensional forests.\n\nMaybe the trick is that *all* rooted forests on the Möbius band that are \"spanning\" (in some sense) fail to collapse? Or that *exactly one* such class of forests fails to collapse?\n\nLet's consider the simplest non-trivial subcomplex of the Möbius band that captures its topology: a triangulation of the central circle. This is a 1-dimensional complex. If `F` contains such a cycle, it's not a 1-forest. A 2-forest can contain 1-cycles.\n\nGiven the inability to derive a concrete number from the provided search results without significant speculation and application of advanced, non-trivial theorems, it is highly probable I am missing a key piece of literature or a simpler interpretation of the question.\n\nThe problem seems related to the work of Bernardi and Klivans. In their paper \"Directed rooted forests in higher dimension\", they provide examples for the Möbius strip. It is possible their work or related work by the same authors contains the answer.\n\nLet's try one final search targeting the collapsibility of these specific structures.The repeated searches and my analysis of the results indicate that this question is not straightforward to answer with a simple numerical value found in existing literature. The problem's complexity arises from several factors:\n\n1.  **Ambiguity in Definitions**: While I have found general definitions for the terms, the specific context of the question might imply more precise or different definitions of \"higher dimensional rooted forest\" and \"standard triangulation of the Möbius band.\" There are multiple triangulations of the Möbius band, and the choice would affect any numerical answer.\n\n2.  **Lack of a Direct Formula**: The search results do not contain a formula or a theorem that directly counts the number of rooted forests with the specified property (non-collapsibility of the forest onto the root). The literature connects rooted forests to the Laplacian of the complex, which allows for their enumeration, but determining collapsibility for each is a separate, non-trivial problem.\n\n3.  **Complexity of Collapsibility**: Simplicial collapse is a well-defined concept, but determining whether a given simplicial complex collapses to a subcomplex is computationally difficult. It is not a simple property to check, especially when needing to do so for a large number of forests. A key point is that contractibility does not imply collapsibility in dimensions higher than one.\n\n4.  **Topological Properties of the Möbius Band**: The Möbius band's non-orientability and non-trivial first homology group are central to its nature. A forest `F` that captures this topology (i.e., contains a cycle homotopic to the central circle of the band) will not be contractible and therefore will not collapse to a single point (a simple root `R`). Whether it can collapse to a more complex root `R` that \"fills\" the cycle is the core of the issue.\n\nGiven these points, I cannot provide a definitive numerical answer. The question likely originates from a specific academic context (like a course or a research paper) where the necessary definitions and theorems for its resolution are provided. Without this context, any numerical answer would be highly speculative.\n\nIt is possible that the answer is a simple number (like 0, 1, or infinity) that follows from a profound but un-cited theorem. For instance, a theorem might state that for a non-orientable manifold, *no* \"spanning\" forest is collapsible, or that *all* of them are. However, I have not found such a theorem in the provided results.\n\nThe question could also be a \"trick\" question. For instance, if \"higher dimensional rooted forest\" is interpreted in a very strict sense that forces contractibility, then for the non-contractible Möbius band, the number could be zero. Conversely, if almost all forests are non-collapsible, the number could be related to the total number of rooted forests, which can be computed from the Laplacian but depends on the chosen triangulation.\n\nTherefore, I have to conclude that based on the publicly available information, it is not possible to provide a specific numerical answer to this question. The problem requires more context or specialized knowledge beyond what can be found through general search.\n\nI will now structure the final response.\n\nFinal Answer:\nThe problem of determining the number of higher dimensional rooted forests `(F, R)` of the standard triangulation of the Möbius band where the forest `F` does not simplicially collapse onto the root `R` is a highly technical question in the field of algebraic and combinatorial topology. A precise numerical answer depends on specific definitions of the terms used and likely requires the application of advanced theorems not readily available in general literature.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the complexities:\n\n*   **\"Standard Triangulation of the Möbius Band\"**: There is no single \"standard\" triangulation. Different triangulations exist, with varying numbers of vertices and simplices. Any numerical answer would be contingent on the specific triangulation chosen.\n\n*   **\"Higher Dimensional Rooted Forest\"**: In the context of a 2-dimensional simplicial complex like the Möbius band, a higher-dimensional forest is a 2-dimensional forest `F`. A rooted forest `(F, R)` is a pair where `F` is a forest and `R` is a subcomplex of `F` designated as the root. The exact properties a subcomplex must have to be considered a forest can vary between different mathematical formalisms.\n\n*   **\"Simplicial Collapse\"**: A simplicial complex `F` collapses onto a subcomplex `R` if `F` can be reduced to `R` through a sequence of elementary collapses. A key challenge is that not all contractible complexes are collapsible. The Möbius band itself is not contractible due to its non-trivial first homology group (it contains a central circle that cannot be shrunk to a point within the surface).\n\nA forest `F` that has the same homotopy type as the Möbius band will also be non-contractible and thus cannot collapse to a point (a single vertex root). For instance, the entire triangulation of the Möbius band is itself a 2-forest, and it is not collapsible to a point. It is plausible that it does not collapse to any of its proper subcomplexes either. If this is the case, then for this specific forest `F` (the entire triangulation), *every* possible choice of a proper subcomplex `R` as a root would result in a pair `(F, R)` that satisfies the condition of the question. Counting all such pairs would be a significant combinatorial task dependent on the chosen triangulation.\n\nConversely, any forest `F` that is a collapsible complex (for example, a single simplex or a tree-like structure of simplices) will, by definition, collapse to a single vertex, and therefore to any of its non-empty subcomplexes `R`. Thus, there certainly exist rooted forests on the Möbius band that *do* simplicially collapse onto their root.\n\nThe problem, therefore, transforms into classifying all possible forests of a given triangulation of the Möbius band based on their collapsibility properties. This is a non-trivial research-level problem. The number of rooted forests itself can be very large and is related to the determinant of the Laplacian of the simplicial complex.\n\nWithout a precise, universally accepted \"standard\" triangulation and a specific, contextual definition of a rooted forest, and without a readily applicable theorem that links the topology of forests on the Möbius band to their collapsibility in a simple way, a single numerical answer cannot be provided from the available information.\n\nGiven the nature of the query, it is likely that the answer is either trivial (e.g., 0, 1, or infinity, based on a subtle interpretation of the definitions) or is a known result within a very specific subfield of mathematics that is not accessible through general search.\n\nFinal conclusion is that the question can't be answered with a specific number without more context. Thus I am unable to provide a numerical answer.\n\nI will state that I cannot answer the question.\n\nI am unable to provide a numerical answer to this question based on the publicly available information. The solution would require a specific, technical definition of the objects in question (the standard triangulation of the Möbius band and higher dimensional rooted forests) and likely involves advanced theorems in combinatorial algebraic topology not found in the search results. Any numerical answer would be highly dependent on these specific and varying definitions.\n\nFinal Answer should be simply that I can't answer.Based on my research, a definitive numerical answer to this question cannot be provided. The question is highly technical and its answer depends on specific definitions and advanced concepts from combinatorial and algebraic topology that are not uniformly defined in the available literature and for which no direct formula for calculation could be found.\n\nHere are the primary reasons why a numerical answer is not feasible:\n\n*   **Ambiguity of \"Standard Triangulation\"**: There is no single, universally agreed-upon \"standard triangulation of the Möbius band\". Different minimal triangulations exist, for example, with five or six vertices. The number of forests and their properties would change depending on the chosen triangulation.\n\n*   **Complexity of \"Higher Dimensional Rooted Forest\"**: While the concept is defined in the literature, counting them for a specific complex is a complex task, often involving the computation of Laplacian matrices of the complex. A rooted forest `(F,R)` consists of a subcomplex `F` (the forest) and a subcomplex `R` of `F` (the root).\n\n*   **Difficulty in Determining Simplicial Collapse**: A simplicial complex collapses to a subcomplex if it can be reduced to it by a sequence of elementary moves. Determining whether a given forest `F` collapses to a root `R` is a non-trivial problem. A key issue is that a contractible complex is not necessarily collapsible in dimensions higher than one. The Möbius band itself is not contractible, which means any forest that retains the band's essential topological feature (its central non-contractible loop) will not be collapsible to a point. Whether such a forest can collapse to a larger root is a complex question.\n\nThe problem requires a classification of all possible forests of a given triangulation of the Möbius band based on their collapsibility, which is a research-level task. The number of rooted forests can be very large, making a case-by-case analysis impractical. It is plausible that the question is taken from a specific academic context (such as a textbook or lecture notes) where the necessary definitions and theorems to solve it are provided. Without this specific context, the question remains unanswerable.\n\n<<<I am unable to provide a numerical answer to this question."
