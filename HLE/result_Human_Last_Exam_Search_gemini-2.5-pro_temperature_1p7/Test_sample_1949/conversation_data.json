    "While Virgil's epic, the *Aeneid*, transports readers to a world where mythology and the foundation of Rome intertwine, it mentions both real and mythological rivers. The lengths of the mythological rivers of the Underworld—Styx, Acheron, Phlegethon, Cocytus, and Lethe—cannot be measured, though they play a significant role in Aeneas's journey, particularly in Book VI during his descent into the realm of the dead. However, the epic also references several actual rivers, the lengths of which can be determined.\n\nThe three longest real rivers mentioned in the Aeneid are:\n\n1.  **Tiber River:** The most prominent river in the *Aeneid*, the Tiber is central to the location of Rome's founding. It is the third-longest river in Italy, with a length of approximately 406 kilometers (252 miles). The river god Tiberinus appears to Aeneas in a dream, confirming he has reached his fated destination.\n\n2.  **Aufidus (modern Ofanto):** This river in southern Italy is mentioned in the Aeneid. Its length is cited with some variation across sources, ranging from 134 to 170 kilometers (83 to 106 miles).\n\n3.  **Timavus (modern Timavo/Reka system):** The Timavus is a unique river system mentioned by Virgil. It flows for a significant distance underground. The surface part of the Timavo river in Italy is only about 2 kilometers long. However, it is fed by the Reka river, which flows for 54 kilometers in Slovenia before disappearing underground for about 38 kilometers. This makes the total length of the river system approximately 92 kilometers, placing it as the third longest.\n\nIt is noteworthy that the **Velinus (modern Velino)**, another river mentioned in the epic, has a length of about 90 kilometers (56 miles), making it very close in length to the Timavus system.\n\nAdditionally, some rivers in the *Aeneid* have both a real and a mythological dimension. For instance, the **Acheron**, a key river of the Underworld in the epic, is also a real river in the Epirus region of Greece, measuring 52 kilometers (32 miles) in length. Other smaller, real rivers mentioned include the **Numicus (modern Fosso di Pratica)**, identified as the Rio Torto which has a length of about 22.79 kilometers, the **Sarnus (modern Sarno)** at 24 kilometers, and the **Almo (modern Almone)**, a small tributary of the Tiber.\n\n<<<The three longest rivers mentioned in the Aeneid are the Tiber, the Aufidus (Ofanto), and the Timavus (Timavo/Reka) system.>>>"
