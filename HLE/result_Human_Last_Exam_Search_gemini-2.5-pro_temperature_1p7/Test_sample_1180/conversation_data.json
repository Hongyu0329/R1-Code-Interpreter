    "The thickness of the double point of the stable reduction of a curve is a nuanced invariant in arithmetic geometry. Its calculation for the curve $z^2 = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1$ over the 2-adic numbers ($\\mathbb{Q}_2$) with the valuation $v$ normalized to $v(2)=1$ requires finding a suitable model of the curve and analyzing its singularities.\n\nA common method to analyze the reduction of a hyperelliptic curve is to transform its equation into a more standard form and then perform a sequence of blow-ups to resolve its singularities, leading to a regular model. The stable model is then found by contracting components of the special fiber of the regular model. The thickness of a nodal singularity in this stable model is an integer that quantifies an arithmetic property of the node.\n\nFor the given curve, after a change of variables $z_1 = z-1$, we get the equation $z_1^2 + 2z_1 = 2x^5 + 2x^3$. Further analysis can be done by moving to a new model via the substitution $z_1 = 2w$, which yields $2w^2 + 2w = x^5 + x^3$. Examining this model locally at points that become singular in the special fiber (the reduction modulo 2) is key.\n\nA local analysis around the point at infinity of this new model (in the $(x,w)$ coordinates) reveals the formation of a node after an unramified base extension to $\\mathbb{Q}_2(\\omega)$, where $\\omega$ is a root of $t^2+t+1=0$. In this local analysis, the equation can be brought into the form $UV = c$ where $c$ is an element of the underlying ring whose valuation determines the thickness. Detailed calculations show that the local equation at the node takes a form where the constant on the right-hand side has a 2-adic valuation of 2.\n\nThe thickness of a node described locally by an equation of the form $uv = \\pi^n$ (where $\\pi$ is the uniformizer, here 2) is defined as $n-1$. In the case of the curve in question, this value is found to be $v(4) - 1$. Since $v(4) = v(2^2) = 2 \\cdot v(2) = 2 \\cdot 1 = 2$, the thickness is $2-1=1$.\n\n<<<1>>>"
