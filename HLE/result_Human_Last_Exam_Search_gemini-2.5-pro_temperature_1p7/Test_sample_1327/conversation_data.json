    "To find the next number in the sequence 2, 11, 23, 51, 119, we need to identify the underlying pattern.\n\nLet's examine the relationship between consecutive terms:\n*   11 = 2 * 2 + 7\n*   23 = 2 * 11 + 1\n*   51 = 2 * 23 + 5\n*   119 = 2 * 51 + 17\n\nThis does not reveal a simple pattern. Let's try another approach by looking for a different kind of relationship.\n\nA common pattern in such sequences is of the form: `next_term = (a * previous_term) + b` or a similar variation. Let's test this.\n\nLet's assume the pattern involves multiplying by a constant and adding or subtracting a value.\n*   From 2 to 11: `2 * 5 + 1 = 11`\n*   From 11 to 23: `11 * 2 + 1 = 23`\n\nThe multiplier changes, so this is not a simple linear relationship.\n\nLet's reconsider the relationship where each term is a multiple of the previous one plus or minus a constant.\n*   11 = 3 * 2 + 5\n*   23 = 3 * 11 - 10\n*   51 = 3 * 23 - 18\n*   119 = 3 * 51 - 34\n\nThe subtracted numbers are 10, 18, 34. The difference between them is 8 and 16, which suggests a pattern. The next difference would be 32.\n*   34 + 32 = 66\nSo, the next term would be:\n`3 * 119 - 66 = 357 - 66 = 291`\n\nLet's try to verify this with another recognized pattern:\n*   2 = 2\n*   11 = 2 * 2 + 7\n*   23 = 2 * 11 + 1\n*   51 = 2 * 23 + 5\n*   119 = 2 * 51 + 17\n\nAnother potential pattern is: `Term(n) = 2 * Term(n-1) + Term(n-2) - 4`\n*   23 = 2 * 11 + 2 - 1 = 23\n*   51 = 2 * 23 + 11 - 6 = 51\n*   119 = 2 * 51 + 23 - 6 = 119\n\nThis seems too complex.\n\nLet's go back to a simpler pattern, which is often found in these types of problems: `Term(n) = 2 * Term(n-1) + k`, where k is not constant.\n\nLet's try a different perspective:\n*   `2 * 2 + 7 = 11`\n*   `2 * 11 + 1 = 23`\n*   `2 * 23 + 5 = 51`\n*   `2 * 51 + 17 = 119`\n\nThe added numbers are 7, 1, 5, 17. There isn't an immediately obvious pattern in this sequence.\n\nLet's analyze the difference between the terms again:\n*   11 - 2 = 9\n*   23 - 11 = 12\n*   51 - 23 = 28\n*   119 - 51 = 68\n\nThe differences are 9, 12, 28, 68. Let's look at the differences of these differences:\n*   12 - 9 = 3\n*   28 - 12 = 16\n*   68 - 28 = 40\n\nThis doesn't seem to reveal a simple arithmetic or geometric progression.\n\nLet's revisit the hypothesis `next_term = (a * previous_term) + b`.\n\nLet's check the options. If the next term is 291 (Option A):\n119, 291\nThe difference is `291 - 119 = 172`.\nThe sequence of differences would be 9, 12, 28, 68, 172.\n\nLet's test the pattern found earlier: `3 * x_n - y_n`\nThe subtracted terms were 10, 18, 34. The differences were 8, 16. The next difference would be 32, making the next subtracted term `34 + 32 = 66`.\nSo, the next term in the sequence is `3 * 119 - 66 = 357 - 66 = 291`.\n\n<<<A>>>"
