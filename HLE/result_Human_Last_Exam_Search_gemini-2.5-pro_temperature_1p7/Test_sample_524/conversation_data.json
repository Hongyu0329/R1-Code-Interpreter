    "There are four homeomorphism classes of homogeneous planar continua.\n\nA homogeneous continuum is a compact, connected metric space where for any two points, there exists a homeomorphism of the space onto itself that maps the first point to the second. In the plane, these are classified into four distinct types based on their topological properties.\n\nThe classification distinguishes between degenerate and non-degenerate continua. A continuum is considered non-degenerate if it consists of more than one point.\n\nThe single degenerate homogeneous planar continuum is:\n*   **The point**\n\nThe three non-degenerate homogeneous planar continua are:\n*   **The simple closed curve (or circle)**\n*   **The pseudo-arc**\n*   **The circle of pseudo-arcs**\n\nThis complete classification was a long-standing problem in topology, with contributions from mathematicians like R. H. Bing and F. B. Jones, and was finalized by L. C. Hoehn and L. G. Oversteegen in 2014. They demonstrated that any non-degenerate homogeneous continuum in the plane must be homeomorphic to one of these three types.\n\nInitially, in 1920, Knaster and Kuratowski raised the question of whether the circle was the only non-degenerate homogeneous continuum in the plane. R. H. Bing discovered the pseudo-arc as another example in 1948, and in 1959, along with Jones, introduced the circle of pseudo-arcs. Jones later classified homogeneous plane continua into three types in 1955: those that don't separate the plane, those that are decomposable and separate the plane, and those that are indecomposable and separate the plane. The final classification confirmed that these three examples are the only ones.\n\n<<<4>>>"
