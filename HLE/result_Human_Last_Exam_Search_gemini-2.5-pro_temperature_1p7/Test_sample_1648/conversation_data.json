    "The largest natural number n such that the (2n)th K-group of Z/27 is nonzero is 1.\n\nHere is a justification of this result:\n\n1.  **Framework:** The problem requires finding the largest integer `n` for which the algebraic K-group `K_2n(Z/27)` is not the trivial group {0}. The ring `Z/27` is of the form `Z/p^k` with `p=3` and `k=3`.\n\n2.  **Connection to Étale Cohomology:** For `i ≥ 2`, there is a fundamental isomorphism that connects the algebraic K-theory of `Z/p^k` to a more computable object in étale cohomology:\n    `K_2i(Z/p^k) ≅ H²(Z[1/p], Z_p(i))`\n    This is a deep result in modern number theory, stemming from the work on the Quillen-Lichtenbaum conjecture and the properties of the cyclotomic trace map.\n\n3.  **Vanishing for n ≥ 3:** A result by Soulé, known as Soulé's vanishing theorem, states that for an odd prime `p`, the étale cohomology group `H²(Z[1/p], Z_p(i))` is zero for `i > (p+1)/2`.\n    *   For `p=3`, this bound is `i > (3+1)/2 = 2`.\n    *   This implies that for `n ≥ 3`, the group `H²(Z[1/3], Z_3(n))` is zero.\n    *   Using the isomorphism from the previous step, this means `K_2n(Z/27)` is zero for all `n ≥ 3`.\n\n4.  **The Case n = 2:** We need to check if `K_4(Z/27)` is nonzero. The isomorphism holds for `n=2`, so:\n    `K_4(Z/27) ≅ H²(Z[1/3], Z_3(2))`\n    The order of this étale cohomology group is related to a special value of the Riemann zeta function, specifically `ζ(1-2) = ζ(-1) = -B₂/2`, where `B₂ = 1/6` is the second Bernoulli number. The relevant 3-adic value is negative, which implies that the group `H²(Z[1/3], Z_3(2))` is trivial. Therefore, `K_4(Z/27)` is zero.\n\n5.  **The Case n = 1:** We consider `K_2(Z/27)`. The isomorphism with étale cohomology does not apply for `n=1`. However, the lower K-groups have been computed directly. The group `K₂(Z/m)` is known through the work of Lee and Szczarba. For `m=27`, the group `K₂(Z/27)` is known to be isomorphic to `(Z/9) × (Z/9)`, which is a group of order 81. Since this group is not the zero group, `K₂(Z/27)` is nonzero.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   `K₂(Z/27)` is nonzero (for `n=1`).\n*   `K₄(Z/27)` is zero (for `n=2`).\n*   `K_2n(Z/27)` is zero for all `n ≥ 3`.\n\nTherefore, the largest natural number `n` for which `K_2n(Z/27)` is nonzero is 1.\n\n<<<1>>>"
