    "An upper semilattice is a partially ordered set where every non-empty finite subset has a least upper bound (join). A functor $f: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K$ from a poset $J$ to the category of vector spaces is called a representation of $J$, or a persistence module.\n\nA functor is considered \"tame\" if its behavior is governed by a finite amount of information. More formally, a functor $F: J \\to C$ is tame if it is the left Kan extension of a functor $G: I \\to C$, where $I$ is a finite poset. When $J$ is an upper semilattice, this structure has particularly useful properties for analyzing the homological properties of the functor.\n\nThe term \"n-resolvable\" in the context of homological algebra typically refers to an object having a projective resolution of length at most $n$. That is, the object's projective dimension is no greater than $n$. A 1-resolvable object $M$ admits a short exact sequence of the form $0 \\to P_1 \\to P_0 \\to M \\to 0$, where $P_0$ and $P_1$ are projective objects. An abelian category where all objects are 1-resolvable is known as a hereditary category.\n\nFor a tame functor $f: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K$ where $J$ is an upper semilattice, it has been established that such functors are 1-resolvable. This is a key result in the algebraic theory of persistence modules, a prominent application of such functors. The category of tame functors indexed by an upper semilattice is hereditary, which implies that every object within it has a projective dimension of at most 1.\n\nTherefore, a tame functor $f: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K$ is 1-resolvable.\n\n<<<1>>>"
