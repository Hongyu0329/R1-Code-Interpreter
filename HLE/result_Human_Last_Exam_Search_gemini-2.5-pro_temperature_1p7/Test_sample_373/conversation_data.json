    "To determine the probability of sampling the bottleneck edge in a 10-node barbell graph with uniform weights during randomized uniform gossiping, we first need to define the structure of the graph and the gossiping process.\n\n### Barbell Graph Structure\n\nA barbell graph is typically constructed by connecting two identical complete graphs (cliques) with a single edge, known as a bridge. For a barbell graph with a total of 10 nodes, the most common interpretation is to have two complete graphs of 5 nodes each (denoted as K5). These two K5 cliques are then connected by a single edge.\n\nThe total number of edges in this graph is calculated as follows:\n*   **Edges in one K5 clique:** A complete graph with 'n' nodes has n*(n-1)/2 edges. For a K5, this is 5 * (5-1) / 2 = 10 edges.\n*   **Edges in both K5 cliques:** Since there are two K5 cliques, the total number of edges within the cliques is 2 * 10 = 20 edges.\n*   **The Bottleneck Edge:** There is one single edge that connects the two K5 cliques. This connecting edge is the \"bottleneck\" of the graph, as it is the sole path for information to travel between the two dense clusters.\n*   **Total Edges:** The total number of edges in the graph is the sum of the edges in the two cliques plus the bottleneck edge: 20 + 1 = 21 edges.\n\n### Randomized Uniform Gossiping\n\nRandomized uniform gossiping assumes that in each step, an edge is selected uniformly at random from the entire set of edges in the graph. This means that every edge, including the bottleneck edge, has an equal probability of being chosen.\n\n### Calculating the Probability\n\nThe probability of sampling any specific edge is 1 divided by the total number of edges in the graph. Since there is only one bottleneck edge:\n\nProbability (sampling the bottleneck edge) = 1 / (Total number of edges)\n\nTherefore, the probability is 1/21.\n\n<<<1/21>>>"
