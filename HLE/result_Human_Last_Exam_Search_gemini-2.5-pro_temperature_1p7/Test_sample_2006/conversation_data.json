    "An August tempest refers to the tumultuous death of a queen in that month. \"Twice fifteen,\" or 30, signifies the year 30 BC, a time that brought significant \"winds of change\" as Egypt was annexed by the Roman Republic. The \"divine one\" who \"yields\" is Cleopatra, who was regarded as a goddess and died by suicide. The title, \"The Bays,\" alludes to the bay laurel wreaths that were symbols of victory in Rome. Cleopatra's defeat and death resulted in these laurels being yielded to her conqueror, Octavian. The answer to the question posed by the title is therefore Cleopatra.\n\n<<<aaceoprt>>>"
