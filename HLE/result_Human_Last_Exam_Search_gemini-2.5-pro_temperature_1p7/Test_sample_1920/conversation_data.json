    "To find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters $\\chi$ of conductor $d = 53599$ and order 6, we first need to determine the prime factorization of the conductor $d$.\n\nFirst, let's factorize $d = 53599$.\nThrough computation, we find the prime factorization of 53599:\n$53599 = 13 \\times 4123$\nBoth 13 and 4123 are prime numbers.\n\nA Dirichlet character $\\chi$ with conductor $d = p_1^{a_1} \\cdots p_k^{a_k}$ can be uniquely written as a product of characters $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\cdots \\chi_k$, where each $\\chi_i$ is a character modulo $p_i^{a_i}$. The character $\\chi$ is primitive if and only if each component character $\\chi_i$ is primitive. The order of $\\chi$ is the least common multiple of the orders of the component characters.\n\nIn our case, $d = 13^1 \\times 4123^1$. A primitive character $\\chi$ with conductor 53599 can be written as a product $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2$, where:\n- $\\chi_1$ is a primitive Dirichlet character modulo 13.\n- $\\chi_2$ is a primitive Dirichlet character modulo 4123.\n\nA character modulo a prime $p$ is primitive if and only if it is not the principal (trivial) character.\n\nWe require the order of $\\chi$ to be 6. The order of $\\chi$ is given by $lcm(\\text{order}(\\chi_1), \\text{order}(\\chi_2)) = 6$. Let $o_1$ be the order of $\\chi_1$ and $o_2$ be the order of $\\chi_2$. For $lcm(o_1, o_2) = 6$, the orders $o_1$ and $o_2$ must be divisors of 6. This means $o_1, o_2 \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 6\\}$. Since $\\chi_1$ and $\\chi_2$ must be primitive, their orders must be greater than 1. So, $o_1, o_2 \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$.\n\nWe can analyze the possible pairs of orders $(o_1, o_2)$ that result in $lcm(o_1, o_2)=6$:\n1. $o_1 = 6$ and $o_2 = 1, 2, 3,$ or $6$. (Since $o_2>1$, we have $o_2 \\in \\{2,3,6\\}$)\n2. $o_2 = 6$ and $o_1 = 1, 2, 3,$ or $6$. (Since $o_1>1$, we have $o_1 \\in \\{2,3,6\\}$)\n3. $o_1=2, o_2=3$.\n4. $o_1=3, o_2=2$.\n\nLet's calculate the number of primitive characters for the required orders for each modulus. The number of characters of order $k$ modulo a prime $p$ is $\\phi(k)$ if $k$ divides $\\phi(p) = p-1$.\n\nFor modulus $p_1=13$:\nThe group of characters modulo 13 is of order $\\phi(13) = 12$. The possible orders are divisors of 12.\n- Number of characters of order 2: $\\phi(2)=1$.\n- Number of characters of order 3: $\\phi(3)=2$.\n- Number of characters of order 6: $\\phi(6)=2$.\n\nFor modulus $p_2=4123$:\nThe group of characters modulo 4123 is of order $\\phi(4123) = 4122 = 2 \\times 3 \\times 687$. The possible orders are divisors of 4122.\n- Number of characters of order 2: $\\phi(2)=1$.\n- Number of characters of order 3: $\\phi(3)=2$.\n- Number of characters of order 6: $\\phi(6)=2$.\n\nNow we can compute the number of pairs $(\\chi_1, \\chi_2)$ for each case:\n- Case $(o_1=2, o_2=3)$: $\\phi(2) \\times \\phi(3) = 1 \\times 2 = 2$.\n- Case $(o_1=3, o_2=2)$: $\\phi(3) \\times \\phi(2) = 2 \\times 1 = 2$.\n- Case $(o_1=6, o_2=2)$: $\\phi(6) \\times \\phi(2) = 2 \\times 1 = 2$.\n- Case $(o_1=6, o_2=3)$: $\\phi(6) \\times \\phi(3) = 2 \\times 2 = 4$.\n- Case $(o_1=6, o_2=6)$: $\\phi(6) \\times \\phi(6) = 2 \\times 2 = 4$.\n- Case $(o_1=2, o_2=6)$: $\\phi(2) \\times \\phi(6) = 1 \\times 2 = 2$.\n- Case $(o_1=3, o_2=6)$: $\\phi(3) \\times \\phi(6) = 2 \\times 2 = 4$.\n\nSumming up the number of characters from all cases:\nTotal number = $2 + 2 + 2 + 4 + 4 + 2 + 4 = 20$.\n\nThere are 20 primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor 53599 and order 6.\n\n<<<20>>>"
