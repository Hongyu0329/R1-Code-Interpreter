    "The equilibrium values for entropy and mean energy in the Bose case of light quanta (photons) can be determined using principles of statistical mechanics, which are rigorously founded on large deviation theorems like those of Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramer-Chernoff. These theorems justify the maximization of entropy for finding the most probable, or equilibrium, state of a system.\n\nFor a system of light quanta, which are bosons with no conservation of particle number (equivalent to a zero chemical potential), we consider the distribution of photons over discrete energy levels. For a single mode of electromagnetic radiation with frequency ν, the allowed energy levels are quantized, similar to a quantum harmonic oscillator, as E_n = n * hν, where *n* is the number of photons and *h* is Planck's constant.\n\nThe core principle, as formalized by Sanov's theorem, is that the equilibrium state corresponds to the probability distribution over microstates that maximizes the entropy, subject to macroscopic constraints like a fixed average energy. The Cramer-Chernoff theorem complements this by showing that the probability of the mean energy deviating significantly from its equilibrium expectation value is exponentially small.\n\nBy maximizing the statistical entropy `S = -k_B Σ p_n ln(p_n)` (where `p_n` is the probability of having *n* photons in the mode and `k_B` is the Boltzmann constant) subject to the constraint of a fixed average energy `U = Σ n*hν*p_n`, one derives the Bose-Einstein distribution for the number of photons at a given temperature T. From this distribution, the equilibrium mean energy and entropy are calculated.\n\nThe equilibrium values for a single mode of frequency ν are:\n\n### Mean Energy (U)\n\nThe average energy `U` of the mode at a temperature `T` is given by Planck's radiation formula:\n`U = hν / (exp(hν / k_B*T) - 1)`\nThis result signifies the average energy of a quantum harmonic oscillator in thermal equilibrium. The number of photons itself is not fixed, but its average value, `<n>`, is `U/hν`.\n\n### Entropy (S)\n\nThe statistical entropy `S` of the mode can be expressed elegantly in terms of the average number of photons, `<n> = U/hν`:\n`S = k_B * [ (<n> + 1) * ln(<n> + 1) - <n> * ln(<n>) ]`\n\nAlternatively, expressed as a function of temperature T, the entropy is:\n`S(T) = k_B * [ (hν / (k_B*T)) / (exp(hν / k_B*T) - 1) - ln(1 - exp(-hν / k_B*T)) ]`\n\nThese expressions represent the equilibrium thermodynamic properties for a gas of photons in a single energy mode, as dictated by the principles of quantum statistical mechanics.\n\n<<<\n**Mean Energy (U):**\n`U = hν / (exp(hν / k_B*T) - 1)`\n\n**Entropy (S):**\n`S = k_B * [ (<n> + 1) * ln(<n> + 1) - <n> * ln(<n>) ]`\nwhere `<n> = U / hν` is the average number of photons.\n>>>"
