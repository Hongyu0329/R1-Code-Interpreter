    "### The solution to the Gauss class number problem for a class number of 48 reveals the existence of 206 negative fundamental discriminants.\n\nThe Gauss class number problem, a long-standing question in number theory, seeks to provide a complete list of imaginary quadratic fields for any given class number. In essence, for a given integer *n*, the problem is to find all negative integers *d* that are fundamental discriminants for which the class number *h(d)* equals *n*.\n\nThe problem for class numbers up to 100 has been resolved by the work of mathematician Mark Watkins. His 2004 paper, \"Class numbers of imaginary quadratic fields,\" published in *Mathematics of Computation*, provides a complete classification. According to this comprehensive work, there are precisely 206 negative fundamental discriminants that have a class number of 48.\n\nThe smallest negative fundamental discriminant with a class number of 48 is -1751. This work built upon earlier developments by mathematicians such as Heegner, Baker, Stark, Goldfeld, and Gross-Zagier, who had solved the problem for smaller class numbers. The complete resolution for higher class numbers like 48 required extensive computation and theoretical advancements.\n\n<<<206>>>"
