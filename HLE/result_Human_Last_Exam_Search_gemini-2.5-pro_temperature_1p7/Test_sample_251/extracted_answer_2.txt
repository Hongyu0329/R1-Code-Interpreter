The number of Maslov 2 holomorphic disks for the specified Lagrangian submanifold is not determinable from the publicly available research literature. The definition of the "iterated monotone Biran circle bundle lift of a Chekanov torus in the complex 4-dimensional projective space" is not standard and appears to be part of ongoing or very recent research in symplectic topology. Therefore, a specific count of these disks cannot be provided.
