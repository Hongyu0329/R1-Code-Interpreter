    "To determine the oligomeric state of the protein coiled-coil sequence `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG`, we must first identify the heptad repeat pattern, denoted as `(abcdefg)n`. The residues at the 'a' and 'd' positions are primarily responsible for the stability and oligomeric state of the coiled-coil through \"knobs-into-holes\" packing. These positions are typically occupied by hydrophobic amino acids.\n\nFirst, we must determine the correct register of the heptad repeat for the given sequence. A common feature of coiled-coils is a repeating pattern of hydrophobic residues at the 'a' and 'd' positions. The hydrophobic residues in the sequence are Isoleucine (I), Leucine (L), Alanine (A), and Tryptophan (W).\n\nLet's analyze the sequence to find the repeating heptad pattern:\n`GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG`\n\nIf we align the sequence and look for a consistent pattern of hydrophobic residues at the first ('a') and fourth ('d') positions of a seven-residue repeat, we can establish the register. Let's test a possible alignment:\n\n`c d e f g a b | c d e f g a b | c d e f g a b | c d e f g a b`\n`G E **I** A Q **S** L | K E **I** A K **S** L | K E **I** A W **S** L | K E **I** A Q **S** L`\n\nThis register places polar or small residues (S, K) at the hydrophobic core positions, which is energetically unfavorable.\n\nLet's try a different register. The most consistent hydrophobic pattern is achieved when we assign the positions as follows:\n\n`g a b c d e f | g a b c d e f | g a b c d e f | g a b c d e f`\n`G E I A Q S **L** | K E I A K S **L** | K E I A W S **L** | K E I A Q S **L**`\n\nThis isn't correct either. Let's try aligning based on the repeating `I` and `L` residues. A highly plausible registration is:\n\n`f g a b c **d** e | f g a b c **d** e | f g a b c **d** e | f g a b c **d** e`\n`G E I A Q **S** L K | E I A K S **L** K E | I A W S L **K** E I | A Q S L K **G**` - also incorrect.\n\nThe most chemically consistent registration is achieved by assigning the start of the heptad in a way that maximizes hydrophobicity at the 'a' and 'd' core positions. Let's consider the following alignment:\n\nHeptad repeat: `abcdefg`\nSequence: `GEI**A**QSL**K**EIA**K**SLK**E**IAW**S**LKE**I**AQSL**K**G`\n\nLet's use the established knowledge that the pattern is based on alternating hydrophobic residues.\nThe correct heptad alignment for the sequence is:\n\n`g **a b c d e f** | g **a b c d e f** | g **a b c d e f** | g **a b c d e f**`\nG **E I A Q S L** | K **E I A K S L** | K **E I A W S L** | K **E I A Q S L** | K G\n\nThis does not place hydrophobic residues at 'a' and 'd'. Let's re-examine the principles. The `a` and `d` positions determine the oligomeric state based on the type of hydrophobic residue. The key rule is the distribution of Isoleucine (I) and Leucine (L):\n*   **Dimer (2-mer):** Isoleucine at position 'a' and Leucine at position 'd'.\n*   **Trimer (3-mer):** Isoleucine at both 'a' and 'd' positions.\n*   **Tetramer (4-mer):** Leucine at position 'a' and Isoleucine at position 'd'.\n\nLet's find the register that fits this rule. We will test the hypothesis that leads to a tetramer, `a=L, d=I`.\n\nIf we set the register as `cdefgab`, we get:\n*   Heptad 1: `GEIAQSL` -> `a=L`, `d=I`\n*   Heptad 2: `KEIAKSL` -> `a=L`, `d=I`\n*   Heptad 3: `KEIAWSL` -> `a=L`, `d=W` (Tryptophan is also a bulky hydrophobic residue, consistent with this packing)\n*   Heptad 4: `KEIAQSL` -> `a=L`, `d=I`\n\nThis alignment gives a very consistent pattern for the core residues:\n*   **'a' positions:** L, L, L, L\n*   **'d' positions:** I, I, W, I\n\nThis `a=L, d=I/W` arrangement strongly favors the formation of a four-stranded (tetrameric) coiled-coil. The packing efficiency of Leucine at the 'a' position and Isoleucine at the 'd' position in the \"knobs-into-holes\" model is optimal for a tetrameric structure.\n\n<<<C>>>"
