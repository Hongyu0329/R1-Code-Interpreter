The initiating biochemical event is the binding of the drug (or its metabolite) to a specific Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) molecule, which stimulates a T-cell mediated cytotoxic reaction. This leads to the release of granulysin, a protein that causes widespread death of keratinocytes (skin cells), resulting in the separation of the epidermis from the dermis and the formation of skin blisters.
