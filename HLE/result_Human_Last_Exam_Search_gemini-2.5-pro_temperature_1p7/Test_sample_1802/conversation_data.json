    "The maximal rank of the complementary channel of a Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ that transforms a qudit density matrix is $d^2$.\n\nA Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ acting on a $d$-dimensional quantum system (a qudit) is described by the following operation on a density matrix $\\rho$:\n$\\Lambda(\\rho) = \\sum_{k=0}^{d^2-1} p_k X_k \\rho X_k^\\dagger$\n\nHere, $\\{X_k\\}$ represents a basis of generalized Pauli operators, which are unitary and satisfy the orthogonality condition $\\text{Tr}(X_i^\\dagger X_j) = d \\delta_{ij}$. The coefficients $\\{p_k\\}$ are probabilities, meaning they are non-negative ($p_k \\ge 0$) and sum to one ($\\sum_k p_k = 1$).\n\nThe Kraus operators for this channel are given by $A_k = \\sqrt{p_k} X_k$. The rank of the complementary channel, $\\Lambda^c$, is determined by the rank of the Gram matrix $G$, whose elements are defined by the trace of the product of the Kraus operators: $G_{ij} = \\text{Tr}(A_i^\\dagger A_j)$.\n\nBy substituting the Kraus operators of the Pauli channel into the Gram matrix formula, we get:\n$G_{ij} = \\text{Tr}((\\sqrt{p_i} X_i)^\\dagger (\\sqrt{p_j} X_j)) = \\sqrt{p_i p_j} \\text{Tr}(X_i^\\dagger X_j)$\n\nUsing the orthogonality property of the Pauli operators, this simplifies to:\n$G_{ij} = \\sqrt{p_i p_j} (d \\delta_{ij})$\n\nThis results in a diagonal matrix with elements $G_{ii} = d p_i$ and off-diagonal elements equal to zero. The rank of a diagonal matrix is simply the count of its non-zero entries. An entry $d p_i$ is non-zero if and only if the probability $p_i$ is greater than zero. Consequently, the rank of the complementary channel is equal to the number of non-zero probabilities $p_k$.\n\nTo find the maximal rank, we must maximize the number of non-zero probabilities $p_k$. Since there are $d^2$ generalized Pauli operators, we can have up to $d^2$ corresponding probabilities. A valid Pauli channel can be constructed where all $d^2$ probabilities are non-zero, for instance, by setting $p_k = 1/d^2$ for all $k$. This specific case corresponds to the completely depolarizing channel.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of non-zero probabilities is $d^2$, which leads to the maximal rank of the complementary channel.\n\n<<<d^2>>>"
