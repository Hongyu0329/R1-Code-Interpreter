    "In perturbative Green's function analysis, the symmetry factor of a Feynman diagram is a crucial element that corrects for overcounting when performing calculations. It arises from the permutations of internal lines and vertices that leave the diagram topologically unchanged.\n\nThe question specifies a Feynman diagram with two vertices and four field contractions. This description most directly corresponds to a vacuum-to-vacuum diagram in a theory with a four-point interaction, such as λφ⁴ theory. In this scenario, all four fields from one vertex are contracted with the four fields of the second vertex, resulting in four internal propagators connecting the two vertices.\n\nTo determine the symmetry factor for this diagram, we consider the possible symmetrical transformations:\n\n1.  **Vertex Interchange**: The two vertices are indistinguishable as they are of the same type and are connected in an identical manner. Swapping them leaves the diagram unchanged. This contributes a factor of 2 to the symmetry factor.\n2.  **Propagator Interchange**: There are four identical propagators (field contractions) connecting the two vertices. These can be permuted among themselves in 4! (4 factorial) ways without altering the diagram's structure. This results in a factor of 4! = 24.\n\nThe total symmetry factor is the product of these individual factors.\n\nSymmetry Factor = (Factor from vertex interchange) × (Factor from propagator interchange)\nSymmetry Factor = 2 × 4!\nSymmetry Factor = 2 × 24\nSymmetry Factor = 48\n\nOther common diagrams with two vertices in φ⁴ theory, such as the \"setting-sun\" diagram (a contribution to the two-point function) or one-loop corrections to the four-point function, feature a different number of internal propagators (three and two, respectively). Therefore, the diagram with two vertices connected by four propagators is the most direct interpretation of the question.\n\n<<<48>>>"
