    "The synthesis of Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF₄) is most commonly achieved by the direct reaction of xenon (Xe) and fluorine (F₂) gas in a nickel container. This exothermic reaction is represented by the chemical equation:\n\nXe + 2F₂ → XeF₄\n\nThe reaction conditions, particularly temperature, are crucial for the efficient production of XeF₄ while minimizing the formation of other xenon fluorides like XeF₂ and XeF₆.\n\nSeveral temperatures and methods for this synthesis are documented:\n*   The original and most frequently cited method involves heating the mixture to 400°C. A temperature range of 350-450°C is also considered effective.\n*   Some flow methods pass the gas mixture through a nickel tube heated to a range of 300-500°C. Another source mentions heating to 873 K (600°C) at 7 bar pressure.\n*   A Russian patent details a method where the reaction is started by heating a combustion initiator with a high-temperature pulse (650–700°C). During this process, the reactor wall is heated to 70–80°C, and the resulting product has a high purity of 97–98% XeF₄.\n\nWhile 400°C is the most common temperature for the standard synthesis, the existence of a patented, high-yield method where the reaction vessel is heated to 70-80°C indicates that efficient production is possible at this lower temperature. Comparing this information to the provided options, 78°C is the coldest temperature at which an efficient synthesis method for Xenon tetrafluoride has been documented.\n\n<<<D>>>"
