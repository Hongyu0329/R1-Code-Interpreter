    "Answering this question requires understanding the definitions of an induced subgraph and a clique.\n\n1.  **Clique:** A clique in a graph is a subset of vertices where every two distinct vertices are adjacent. A clique of size *k* is denoted as K_k.\n\n2.  **Induced Subgraph:** An induced subgraph is a subgraph formed from a subset of vertices and *all* the edges connecting pairs of vertices in that subset.\n\nLet G be a graph on n = 128 vertices. We want to find the maximum number of different values of *k* for which G contains an induced subgraph isomorphic to K_k.\n\nLet S be the set of all integers *k* such that G contains an induced K_k. The problem is to find the maximum possible size of S for a graph with 128 vertices.\n\nConsider a graph G that contains an induced clique of size *k*, let's call it K_k. This means there is a set of *k* vertices in G, let's call this set V_k, such that every vertex in V_k is connected to every other vertex in V_k.\n\nNow, consider any subset of V_k with size *j*, where 1 ≤ *j* < *k*. Let this subset be V_j. Since every vertex in the larger set V_k is connected to every other vertex, it follows that every vertex in the subset V_j is also connected to every other vertex in V_j. Therefore, the subgraph induced by V_j is a complete graph of size *j*, a K_j.\n\nThis leads to a crucial conclusion: if a graph contains an induced clique of size *k*, it must also contain an induced clique of every size *j* for 1 ≤ *j* ≤ *k*.\n\nThis implies that for any graph G, the set of sizes of its induced cliques is always of the form {1, 2, 3, ..., ω(G)}, where ω(G) is the clique number of the graph (the size of the largest clique in G). The number of different clique sizes is therefore equal to the clique number, ω(G).\n\nThe problem is now reduced to finding the maximum possible clique number for a graph with 128 vertices. The clique number of any graph on *n* vertices can be at most *n*. For n = 128, the maximum possible clique number is 128.\n\nThis maximum is achieved by the complete graph on 128 vertices, K_128. In K_128, every pair of distinct vertices is connected by an edge. The entire graph is a clique of size 128. Based on the logic above, K_128 also contains induced cliques of all sizes from 1 to 128. Thus, for G = K_128, the set of induced clique sizes is {1, 2, ..., 128}.\n\nThe number of different clique sizes in this set is 128. Since the clique number cannot exceed the number of vertices, this is the maximum possible number.\n\n<<<128>>>"
