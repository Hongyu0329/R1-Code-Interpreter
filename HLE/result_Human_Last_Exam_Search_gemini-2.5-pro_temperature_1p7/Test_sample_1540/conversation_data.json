    "To solve this problem in the most memory-efficient way, we should avoid storing both strings in memory simultaneously if possible. The optimal strategy is to read the first string into a buffer and then read the second string one character at a time, performing the comparison on the fly. This avoids allocating memory for the second string.\n\nThe C code below implements this memory-saving approach.\n\n### Memory-Efficient C Program\n\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <ctype.h>\n\n/*\n * This program compares two strings lexicographically, ignoring case.\n * It is designed to be memory-efficient by only storing the first\n * string and reading the second string character by character.\n */\nint main(void) {\n    // A character array to store the first string.\n    // The maximum length is 100, plus one for the null terminator.\n    char str1[101];\n\n    // An integer to use as a loop counter and index.\n    int i = 0;\n\n    // A character variable to store each character of the second string.\n    char ch2;\n\n    // Read the first string from standard input.\n    scanf(\"%s\", str1);\n\n    // Loop through the first string until its end. The problem guarantees\n    // the strings are of the same length, so this loop will process\n    // all characters of the second string as well.\n    while (str1[i] != '\\0') {\n        // Read a single character for the second string.\n        // The space in \" %c\" is important as it consumes any whitespace\n        // characters, including the newline left after reading str1.\n        scanf(\" %c\", &ch2);\n\n        // Convert characters to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison.\n        // We compare the results of tolower() directly to avoid using\n        // additional variables for the lowercase characters.\n        if (tolower((unsigned char)str1[i]) < tolower((unsigned char)ch2)) {\n            printf(\"-1\\n\");\n            return 0; // The first string is lexicographically smaller.\n        }\n        if (tolower((unsigned char)str1[i]) > tolower((unsigned char)ch2)) {\n            printf(\"1\\n\");\n            return 0; // The second string is lexicographically smaller.\n        }\n\n        // If characters are equal, move to the next one.\n        i++;\n    }\n\n    // If the loop completes, all characters were equal.\n    printf(\"0\\n\");\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Calculation of Memory Usage (m)\n\nThe total memory usage `m` is the sum of the memory allocated for all variables in the program. The sizes of C data types can be platform-dependent, but for competitive programming, we can assume a standard 32-bit or 64-bit environment where `char` is 1 byte and `int` is 4 bytes.\n\nThe variables declared in the `main` function are:\n1.  `char str1[101];`: An array to hold the first string (up to 100 characters) and a null terminator (`\\0`). This consumes `101 * sizeof(char)` = `101 * 1` = **101 bytes**.\n2.  `int i;`: An integer variable used as a loop index. This consumes `sizeof(int)`, which is typically **4 bytes** on modern systems used in competitive programming.\n3.  `char ch2;`: A character variable to store characters from the second string one by one. This consumes `sizeof(char)` = **1 byte**.\n\nNo other variables are explicitly declared or allocated. Therefore, the total memory `m` is the sum of the sizes of these variables.\n\n**m** = (size of `str1`) + (size of `i`) + (size of `ch2`)\n**m** = 101 + 4 + 1 = 106 bytes\n\n<<<106>>>"
