    "In her acclaimed 2008 performance of the \"Don Quixote\" Act I variation, Natalia Osipova, then a soloist with the Bolshoi Ballet, did not perform any single-turn pirouettes en dehors from the fifth position. Her variation was celebrated for its high energy and technical brilliance, featuring multiple turns, but not the specific single pirouettes from the fifth position as questioned.\n\nDuring a guest performance in Novosibirsk, Siberia, in 2008, Osipova's rendition of Kitri's first-act variation showcased her remarkable talent. Reviews and available footage from that period highlight her extraordinary speed and jumping ability. While she executed numerous pirouettes, they were typically multiple rotations, often doubles or triples, and not initiated from a standard fifth position as single turns. A video of this specific variation shows a sequence of fouett√© turns and other complex turning steps rather than a series of single pirouettes from the fifth position. Her performances were noted for their \"daredeviltry, pyrotechnics, and flamboyance,\" with a focus on dazzling, multi-revolution turns.\n\n<<<0>>>"
