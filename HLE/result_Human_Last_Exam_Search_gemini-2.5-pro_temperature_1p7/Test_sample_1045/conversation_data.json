    "Toluene has the chemical formula C7H8. To calculate the total number of contracted Gaussian functions for a 6-31G basis set calculation of toluene, we need to determine the number of functions for each atom (carbon and hydrogen) and then sum them up.\n\nFor a 6-31G basis set:\n*   Each carbon atom (a second-row element) has a 1s core orbital and 2s, 2px, 2py, and 2pz valence orbitals. The core orbital is represented by one contracted Gaussian function (from 6 primitives). The valence shell is split into two basis functions for each atomic orbital (a double-zeta basis set). One valence basis function is a contraction of 3 primitive Gaussians, and the other is a single primitive Gaussian. Therefore, for each carbon atom, there is 1 (for 1s) + 4 (for 2s, 2px, 2py, 2pz) * 2 = 9 contracted Gaussian functions.\n\n*   Each hydrogen atom has only a 1s orbital. In the 6-31G basis set, this is also a split-valence representation. The 1s orbital is represented by two contracted Gaussian functions. One is a contraction of 3 primitive Gaussians, and the other is a single primitive Gaussian. So, each hydrogen atom has 2 contracted Gaussian functions.\n\nNow, we can calculate the total number of contracted Gaussian functions for toluene (C7H8):\n\n*   For the 7 carbon atoms: 7 atoms * 9 functions/atom = 63 functions\n*   For the 8 hydrogen atoms: 8 atoms * 2 functions/atom = 16 functions\n*   Total number of contracted Gaussian functions = 63 + 16 = 79\n\nThus, a 6-31G basis set calculation of toluene uses 79 contracted Gaussian functions.\n<<<79>>>"
