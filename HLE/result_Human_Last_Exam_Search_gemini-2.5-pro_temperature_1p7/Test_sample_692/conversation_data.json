    "## The Dawn of Recorded Time in the Americas: A Tale of Competing Glyphs\n\nThe earliest known date definitively recorded by a pre-Columbian civilization in the Americas using an aboriginal writing system is **December 36 BCE**. This date is inscribed on Stela 2 from the archaeological site of Chiapa de Corzo in Chiapas, Mexico, and is expressed in the Mesoamerican Long Count calendar.\n\nWhile other, older examples of writing systems exist in the Americas, the interpretation of specific dates on these artifacts remains a subject of scholarly debate. This makes the Chiapa de Corzo stela a landmark monument in the history of the Western Hemisphere.\n\nTwo other significant artifacts predate the Chiapa de Corzo stela, though their claims to holding the earliest recorded date are not as firm.\n\nOne is a **cylinder seal discovered at San Andrés**, near the Olmec center of La Venta in Tabasco, Mexico, dated to approximately **650 BCE**. Glyphs on this seal have been interpreted as \"3 Ajaw,\" a day in the 260-day sacred calendar. However, some researchers argue that these symbols may be iconographic rather than a direct representation of a date.\n\nAnother contender is **Monument 3 from San José Mogote**, a Zapotec site in Oaxaca. This monument, which may date to before **500 BCE**, bears glyphs that have been interpreted as the name of a captive, \"1 Earthquake,\" which would also correspond to a day in the calendar. However, the dating of this monument is not considered secure, as the stone may have been reused.\n\nThe oldest known example of writing in the Americas is the **Cascajal Block**, an Olmec artifact dated to around **900 BCE**. This serpentine slab contains 62 distinct glyphs. While it is a testament to the antiquity of writing in the region, the script remains undeciphered, and there is no consensus that it records a specific date. Some interpretations suggest it could be a list of sacred objects or have a religious significance rather than a calendrical one.\n\nTherefore, while the Olmec and Zapotec civilizations were pioneers in the development of writing in the Americas, the earliest *confirmed* and precisely recorded date belongs to the civilization at Chiapa de Corzo.\n\n<<<December 36 BCE>>>"
