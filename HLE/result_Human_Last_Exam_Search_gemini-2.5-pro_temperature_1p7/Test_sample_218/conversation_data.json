    "There are 48 irreducible representations (irreps) of the symmetric group on 25 elements, $S_{25}$, that have a dimension strictly less than 500,000.\n\nThe dimensions of the irreducible representations of the symmetric group $S_n$ are indexed by the partitions of $n$. For $S_{25}$, we need to find the number of partitions of 25 for which the dimension of the corresponding irrep is less than 500,000. The dimension of an irrep corresponding to a partition $\\lambda$ is given by the hook-length formula.\n\nThe irreducible representations with small dimensions correspond to partitions whose Young diagrams are \"long and thin\" or \"short and wide\". These are partitions of the form $(n-k, \\ldots)$ for small $k$. Each such partition $\\lambda$ has a conjugate partition $\\lambda'$, which corresponds to an irreducible representation of the same dimension. None of the partitions listed below are self-conjugate, so they come in pairs.\n\nHere is a list of the partitions $\\lambda$ of 25 whose corresponding irreducible representation has a dimension $d_\\lambda < 500,000$, along with their dimensions:\n\n1.  Partition: (25), Dimension: 1\n2.  Partition: (24, 1), Dimension: 24\n3.  Partition: (23, 2), Dimension: 275\n4.  Partition: (23, 1, 1), Dimension: 276\n5.  Partition: (22, 3), Dimension: 2,000\n6.  Partition: (22, 1, 1, 1), Dimension: 2,024\n7.  Partition: (22, 2, 1), Dimension: 4,025\n8.  Partition: (21, 4), Dimension: 10,350\n9.  Partition: (21, 3, 1), Dimension: 10,450\n10. Partition: (21, 1, 1, 1, 1), Dimension: 10,626\n11. Partition: (21, 2, 1, 1), Dimension: 31,625\n12. Partition: (20, 5), Dimension: 40,480\n13. Partition: (21, 2, 2), Dimension: 42,000\n14. Partition: (20, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1), Dimension: 42,504\n15. Partition: (20, 4, 1), Dimension: 55,200\n16. Partition: (20, 3, 2), Dimension: 103,500\n17. Partition: (19, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1), Dimension: 134,596\n18. Partition: (19, 5, 1), Dimension: 193,992\n19. Partition: (19, 6), Dimension: 247,380\n20. Partition: (19, 4, 2), Dimension: 284,025\n21. Partition: (18, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1), Dimension: 346,104\n22. Partition: (19, 3, 3), Dimension: 410,850\n23. Partition: (18, 3, 2, 1), Dimension: 414,175\n24. Partition: (18, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1), Dimension: 454,050\n\nEach of these 24 partitions has a conjugate partition, which also corresponds to an irreducible representation of the same dimension. For example, the conjugate of (25) is (1,1,...,1), both having dimension 1. The conjugate of (24,1) is (2,1,1,...,1), both having dimension 24. Since none of these 24 partitions are self-conjugate, we have 24 pairs of representations.\n\nThis gives a total of $24 \\times 2 = 48$ irreducible representations with dimensions strictly less than 500,000.\n\n<<<48>>>"
