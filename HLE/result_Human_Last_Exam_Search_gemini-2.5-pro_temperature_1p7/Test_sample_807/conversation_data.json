    "The chemical compound 9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride is more commonly known as Rhodamine B. It is a dye that produces a reddish-violet or brilliant pink color.\n\nCrayola, the manufacturer of the popular crayons, states that their crayons are made from paraffin wax and color pigments. However, the precise chemical composition of the pigments used for each specific crayon color is considered proprietary information and is not publicly disclosed.\n\nWhile one online forum discussion mentions Rhodamine B in the context of a red dye, there is no official source from Crayola or a verifiable analysis that confirms its use in any of their crayon colors. Therefore, it is not possible to definitively identify a specific Crayola crayon color that contains 9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride.\n\n<<<Not available>>>"
