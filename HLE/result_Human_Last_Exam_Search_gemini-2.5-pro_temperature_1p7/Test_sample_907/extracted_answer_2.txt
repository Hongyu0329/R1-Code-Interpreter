The absorption cross-section within the first-order time-dependent perturbation theory for a chain of molecules with a pre-existing exciton at t=0, subjected to an ultrashort Gaussian laser pulse, is described by the following equations for the two cases:

**a) Negligible interaction between molecules:**

The total absorption cross-section `σ_a(ω)` is the sum of contributions from exciting any of the `N-1` ground-state molecules and the potential further excitation of the already excited molecule:

`σ_a(ω) = (N-1) ⋅ C ⋅ ω ⋅ |μ_{eg}|^2 ⋅ G(ω - ω_{eg}) + C ⋅ ω ⋅ |μ_{e'e}|^2 ⋅ G(ω - ω_{e'e})`

where:
*   `N` is the number of molecules.
*   `C` is a constant derived from fundamental physical constants.
*   `ω` is the angular frequency of the light.
*   `μ_{eg}` is the transition dipole moment for a ground-to-excited state (`g` → `e`) transition of a single molecule.
*   `μ_{e'e}` is the transition dipole moment for a transition from the excited state to a higher excited state (`e` → `e'`).
*   `ω_{eg}` and `ω_{e'e}` are the respective transition frequencies.
*   `G(Δω) = (τ/√π) exp(-(Δω)²τ²)` represents the Gaussian lineshape function dictated by the laser pulse's temporal width `τ`.

**b) Near-neighbor interaction is considered:**

Interactions lead to delocalized Frenkel exciton states. The absorption involves a transition from a one-exciton state to a band of two-exciton states. The equation becomes:

`σ_b(ω) = C ⋅ ω ⋅ Σ_f |⟨2_f|μ_{total}|1_i⟩|² ⋅ G(ω - (E_{2,f} - E_{1,i})/ħ)`

where:
*   `|1_i⟩` is the initial delocalized one-exciton state with energy `E_{1,i}`.
*   The sum runs over the final delocalized two-exciton states `|2_f⟩` with energies `E_{2,f}`.
*   `μ_{total}` is the total dipole operator for the entire chain.
*   `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant.
*   `G(Δω)` is the same Gaussian lineshape function.

In this case, the energies and the transition dipole matrix elements depend on the intermolecular coupling strength `J` and exciton-exciton interactions, resulting in an absorption profile that is a band, distinct from the single-molecule spectrum.
