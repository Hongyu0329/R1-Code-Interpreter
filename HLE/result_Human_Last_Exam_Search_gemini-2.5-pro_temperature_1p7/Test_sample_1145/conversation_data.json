    "The probability of finding a particle in a 1D box in a specific interval is given by the integral of the probability density function, |ψ(x)|², over that interval. The length of the box is 'a'.\n\nThe normalized wavefunction for a particle in a 1D box for a given quantum number *n* is:\nψn(x) = √(2/a) * sin(nπx/a)\n\nFor n=2, the wavefunction is:\nψ₂(x) = √(2/a) * sin(2πx/a)\n\nThe probability density function is:\n|ψ₂(x)|² = (2/a) * sin²(2πx/a)\n\nWe need to find the probability of the particle being in the interval from 0.495a to 0.505a. This is calculated by the following integral:\nP = ∫ [from 0.495a to 0.505a] (2/a) * sin²(2πx/a) dx\n\nTo solve this integral, we use the trigonometric identity sin²(θ) = (1 - cos(2θ))/2.\nHere, θ = 2πx/a, so 2θ = 4πx/a.\nThe integral becomes:\nP = (2/a) ∫ [from 0.495a to 0.505a] (1 - cos(4πx/a))/2 dx\nP = (1/a) ∫ [from 0.495a to 0.505a] (1 - cos(4πx/a)) dx\n\nNow, we perform the integration:\n∫(1 - cos(4πx/a)) dx = x - (a/4π)sin(4πx/a)\n\nNext, we evaluate the definite integral:\nP = (1/a) * [ (x - (a/4π)sin(4πx/a)) ] from 0.495a to 0.505a\nP = (1/a) * [ (0.505a - (a/4π)sin(4π*0.505a/a)) - (0.495a - (a/4π)sin(4π*0.495a/a)) ]\nP = (1/a) * [ 0.01a - (a/4π)(sin(2.02π) - sin(1.98π)) ]\nP = 0.01 - (1/4π)(sin(2π + 0.02π) - sin(2π - 0.02π))\nUsing the identities sin(2π + α) = sin(α) and sin(2π - α) = -sin(α):\nP = 0.01 - (1/4π)(sin(0.02π) - (-sin(0.02π)))\nP = 0.01 - (1/4π)(2sin(0.02π))\nP = 0.01 - sin(0.02π)/(2π)\n\nNow, we calculate the numerical value using a calculator:\nsin(0.02π) ≈ 0.062816\nP ≈ 0.01 - 0.062816 / (2 * 3.14159)\nP ≈ 0.01 - 0.00999746\nP ≈ 0.00000254\n\nSince the interval is very small, we can also approximate the probability. For n=2, the wavefunction has a node at x=a/2. The interval [0.495a, 0.505a] is centered at this node. Near the node, we can approximate sin(2πx/a) ≈ 2π(x - a/2)/a. The probability density becomes |ψ₂|² ≈ (2/a) * (2π(x - a/2)/a)². Integrating this approximation gives a value of approximately 6.58 x 10⁻⁶. The discrepancy arises from the precision of the calculation method. A more precise calculation of the exact formula gives:\nP ≈ 0.00000658.\n\nThe probability is very low, which is expected as the interval is centered around a node of the n=2 wavefunction where the probability density is zero.\n\n<<<0.00000658>>>"
