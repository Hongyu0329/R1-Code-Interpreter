The one-step transformation of the probability distribution is given by the equation:
$P_i(t+1) = p * P_{i-1}(t) + q * P_{i+1}(t)$

The transition probability matrix Ã‚ is a circulant matrix with the following structure:
```
     [0, q, 0, ..., p]
     [p, 0, q, ..., 0]
A =  [0, p, 0, ..., 0]
     [...          ]
     [q, 0, ..., p, 0]
```

The eigenvectors are of the form $e^{ijk_n}$ with corresponding eigenvalues $\lambda_n = p * e^{ik_n} + q * e^{-ik_n}$. The rate of relaxation, determined by the second-largest eigenvalue, is $cos(2\pi/N)$ for a symmetric random walk ($p=q=1/2$).
