    "To find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $N = 36036$ and order 6, we will follow these steps:\n\n### 1. Prime Factorization of the Conductor\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of $N$:\n$N = 36036 = 36 \\times 1001 = (2^2 \\times 3^2) \\times (7 \\times 11 \\times 13)$\nSo, $N = 2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 13$.\n\n### 2. Primitive Characters and their Decomposition\nA Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $N$ is primitive if and only if it can be written as a product of primitive Dirichlet characters modulo each prime power factor of $N$.\nLet $\\chi = \\chi_{4} \\chi_{9} \\chi_{7} \\chi_{11} \\chi_{13}$, where each $\\chi_{p^k}$ is a primitive character modulo $p^k$.\n\nThe order of the character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters:\n$\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_{4}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{9}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{7}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{11}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{13}))$.\nWe are given that the order of $\\chi$ is 6.\n\n### 3. Number and Orders of Primitive Characters for Each Factor\nFor the order of $\\chi$ to be 6, two conditions must be met:\n1.  The order of each component character $\\chi_{p^k}$ must be a divisor of 6.\n2.  The set of orders of the component characters must contain a multiple of 2 and a multiple of 3.\n\nLet's analyze the possible orders for primitive characters for each prime power factor $p^k$:\n\n*   **Modulo 4 ($2^2$)**: The group of characters $(\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$ is isomorphic to $C_2$. There is one primitive character, and its order is 2. So, $\\text{ord}(\\chi_{4}) = 2$. There is only **1** choice for $\\chi_{4}$.\n\n*   **Modulo 9 ($3^2$)**: The group of characters $(\\mathbb{Z}/9\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$ is isomorphic to $C_6$. The non-primitive characters are those induced from modulo 3, which have orders 1 and 2. Thus, primitive characters modulo 9 must have orders that are divisors of 6 but not 1 or 2. The possible orders are 3 and 6.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$.\n    The total number of choices for $\\chi_{9}$ is $2+2 = \\textbf{4}$.\n\n*   **Modulo 7**: The group of characters $(\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$ is isomorphic to $C_6$. All non-trivial characters are primitive. Their orders are the divisors of 6, excluding 1, which are 2, 3, and 6.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$.\n    The total number of choices for $\\chi_{7}$ is $1+2+2 = \\textbf{5}$.\n\n*   **Modulo 11**: The group of characters $(\\mathbb{Z}/11\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$ is isomorphic to $C_{10}$. The orders of primitive characters are divisors of 10, excluding 1, i.e., 2, 5, and 10. For the order of $\\chi$ to be 6, the order of $\\chi_{11}$ must divide 6. The only such order is 2.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$.\n    There is only **1** choice for $\\chi_{11}$.\n\n*   **Modulo 13**: The group of characters $(\\mathbb{Z}/13\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$ is isomorphic to $C_{12}$. The orders of primitive characters are divisors of 12, excluding 1. For the order of $\\chi$ to be 6, the order of $\\chi_{13}$ must divide 6. The possible orders are 2, 3, and 6.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$.\n    The total number of choices for $\\chi_{13}$ is $1+2+2 = \\textbf{5}$.\n\n### 4. Calculating the Total Number of Characters\nLet the orders of the component characters be $o_{4}, o_{9}, o_{7}, o_{11}, o_{13}$. We have established the possible choices for each character such that their order divides 6.\n*   $o_4 \\in \\{2\\}$\n*   $o_9 \\in \\{3, 6\\}$\n*   $o_7 \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$\n*   $o_{11} \\in \\{2\\}$\n*   $o_{13} \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$\n\nNow we must verify that $\\text{lcm}(o_4, o_9, o_7, o_{11}, o_{13}) = 6$.\n*   Since the order of $\\chi_4$ is always 2, the lcm is always a multiple of 2.\n*   Since the order of $\\chi_9$ is always 3 or 6, the lcm is always a multiple of 3.\n\nTherefore, the lcm is always a multiple of $\\text{lcm}(2, 3) = 6$. As all individual orders are divisors of 6, their lcm must also divide 6. A number that is both a multiple of 6 and a divisor of 6 must be 6 itself.\nThis means that any combination of the allowed choices for the component characters will result in a final character of order 6.\n\nThe total number of primitive characters of conductor $N=36036$ and order 6 is the product of the number of choices for each component character:\nTotal number = (Choices for $\\chi_{4}$) $\\times$ (Choices for $\\chi_{9}$) $\\times$ (Choices for $\\chi_{7}$) $\\times$ (Choices for $\\chi_{11}$) $\\times$ (Choices for $\\chi_{13}$)\nTotal number = $1 \\times 4 \\times 5 \\times 1 \\times 5 = 100$.\n\n"
