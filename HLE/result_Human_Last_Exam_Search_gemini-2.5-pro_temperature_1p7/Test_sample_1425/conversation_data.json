    "In the grand canonical ensemble, the partition function Z is defined as the trace of the statistical operator e<sup>-β(Ĥ - μ'N̂)</sup>, where Ĥ is the Hamiltonian of the system, N̂ is the particle number operator, μ' is the chemical potential of the reservoir, and β = 1/(k<sub>B</sub>T) is the inverse temperature.\n\nThe trace can be expressed as a path integral over fields ψ(**x**, τ), where **x** represents spatial coordinates and τ is the imaginary time variable that runs from 0 to β. The specific form of the action in the path integral depends on the Hamiltonian.\n\nGiven the system Hamiltonian Ĥ = -μN̂, the operator in the exponent of the grand canonical partition function becomes:\n\nK̂ = Ĥ - μ'N̂ = -μN̂ - μ'N̂ = -(μ + μ')N̂\n\nFor simplicity, let's define an effective chemical potential, μ<sub>eff</sub> = μ + μ'. The partition function to be calculated is Z = Tr[e<sup>βμ<sub>eff</sub>N̂</sup>].\n\nThe path integral representation for this partition function is:\n\n**Z = ∫ D[ψ*, ψ] exp(-S[ψ*, ψ])**\n\nHere, ∫ D[ψ*, ψ] represents the functional integral over all possible field configurations. The action, S[ψ*, ψ], is given by:\n\n**S[ψ*, ψ] = ∫<sub>0</sub><sup>β</sup> dτ ∫ d<sup>d</sup>x ψ*(**x**, τ) [ ∂/∂τ - μ<sub>eff</sub> ] ψ(**x**, τ)**\n\nIn this expression:\n*   ψ(**x**, τ) are the fields representing the particles. These are complex-valued functions for bosons and anticommuting Grassmann numbers for fermions.\n*   ψ*(**x**, τ) is the complex conjugate (for bosons) or Grassmann conjugate (for fermions) of the field.\n*   The integral is performed over imaginary time τ from 0 to β and over all d spatial dimensions **x**.\n\nThe fields must satisfy boundary conditions in the imaginary time direction, which arise from the trace operation.\n*   For **bosons**, the fields are periodic: ψ(**x**, 0) = ψ(**x**, β).\n*   For **fermions**, the fields are anti-periodic: ψ(**x**, 0) = -ψ(**x**, β).\n\nThis formulation represents the partition function for a system of non-interacting particles whose energy is solely determined by the particle number, as described by the Hamiltonian Ĥ = -μN̂, within the grand canonical ensemble.\n\n<<<For a system with Hamiltonian Ĥ = -μN̂ in the grand canonical ensemble with reservoir chemical potential μ', the partition function Z expressed as a path integral is:\n\n**Z = ∫ D[ψ*, ψ] exp( - ∫<sub>0</sub><sup>β</sup> dτ ∫ d<sup>d</sup>x ψ*(**x**, τ) [ ∂/∂τ - (μ + μ') ] ψ(**x**, τ) )**\n\nwhere:\n*   ψ(**x**, τ) are the quantum fields (complex for bosons, Grassmann for fermions).\n*   ∫ D[ψ*, ψ] is the path integral measure.\n*   β = 1/(k<sub>B</sub>T) is the inverse temperature.\n*   The fields obey periodic boundary conditions (ψ(**x**, 0) = ψ(**x**, β)) for bosons and anti-periodic boundary conditions (ψ(**x**, 0) = -ψ(**x**, β)) for fermions.>>>"
