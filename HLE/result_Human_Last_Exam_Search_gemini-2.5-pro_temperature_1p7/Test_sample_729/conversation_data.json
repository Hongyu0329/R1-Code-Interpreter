    "A power subgroup of a group G, denoted as G^k, is the subgroup generated by the k-th powers of all elements in G. The generalized quaternion group of order 128, denoted as Q_128, has a specific structure that allows us to determine its power subgroups.\n\nThe generalized quaternion group Q_128 can be defined by the presentation:\nQ_128 = < x, y | x^64 = 1, x^32 = y^2, yxy^(-1) = x^(-1) >\n\nTo find the number of distinct power subgroups, we analyze the subgroups G^k for positive integers k. The result depends on whether k is odd or even.\n\n### Case 1: k is an odd number\n\nFor any odd integer k, the power subgroup G^k is the entire group Q_128 itself. The k-th powers of the elements in the cyclic subgroup <x> generate <x> because k is coprime to the order of x (64). The k-th power of an element outside <x>, such as y, results in an element of the form x^m * y. Therefore, the set of all k-th powers generates the whole group. This gives one power subgroup.\n\n### Case 2: k is an even number\n\nWhen k is an even integer, the situation is different. The k-th power of any element of the form x^i*y is a power of x^32. The k-th powers of the elements of the form x^i are powers of x^k. It can be shown that for any even k, the power subgroup G^k is equal to the cyclic subgroup <x^k>, which is the same as <x^gcd(k, 64)>.\n\nTo find the distinct subgroups for even k, we need to find the distinct subgroups of the form <x^d> where d = gcd(k, 64) for some even integer k. The possible values for d are the divisors of 64 that are also multiples of 2:\n\n*   **d = 2:**  G^2 = <x^2>, a cyclic subgroup of order 32.\n*   **d = 4:**  G^4 = <x^4>, a cyclic subgroup of order 16.\n*   **d = 8:**  G^8 = <x^8>, a cyclic subgroup of order 8.\n*   **d = 16:** G^16 = <x^16>, a cyclic subgroup of order 4.\n*   **d = 32:** G^32 = <x^32>, a cyclic subgroup of order 2.\n*   **d = 64:** G^64 = <x^64>, the trivial subgroup {1}.\n\nThis accounts for 6 distinct power subgroups.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nCombining both cases, the set of all distinct power subgroups of the generalized quaternion group of size 128 is {Q_128, <x^2>, <x^4>, <x^8>, <x^16>, <x^32>, {1}}.\nCounting these distinct subgroups, we have 1 subgroup from the odd powers of k and 6 subgroups from the even powers of k.\n\nIn total, there are 7 power subgroups.\n\n<<<7>>>"
