    "The reaction between 1,3-dibromo-2-iodobenzene and excess phenyl magnesium bromide in refluxing tetrahydrofuran (THF), followed by an aqueous work-up, results in the substitution of all three halogen atoms with phenyl groups.\n\nThe reactivity of aryl halides in Grignard reactions increases in the order of Cl < Br < I. This means the carbon-iodine bond is the most reactive, followed by the carbon-bromine bonds.\n\n1.  **Step 1:** The phenyl magnesium bromide, a potent nucleophile, will first react with the most reactive site on the 1,3-dibromo-2-iodobenzene molecule, which is the iodine atom at position 2. This substitution replaces the iodine with a phenyl group.\n2.  **Step 2 & 3:** Due to the use of *excess* phenyl magnesium bromide and heating (reflux), the less reactive bromine atoms at positions 1 and 3 will also undergo substitution with phenyl groups.\n\nThis sequence of substitutions leads to a final product where the central benzene ring is attached to three phenyl groups at positions 1, 2, and 3. The IUPAC name for this compound is 1,2,3-triphenylbenzene. The aqueous work-up serves to quench any unreacted Grignard reagent.\n\n<<<1,2,3-triphenylbenzene>>>"
