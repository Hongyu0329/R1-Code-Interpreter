    "To determine the smallest and largest possible rank of the Néron-Severi group of X = C^(15), the 15th symmetric power of a genus 3 Riemann surface C, we will analyze the geometry of X and its relation to the Jacobian of C.\n\n### Structure of the Symmetric Power X\nLet C be a smooth projective curve of genus g, and let X = C^(d) be its d-th symmetric power. The Abel-Jacobi map defines a morphism p: C^(d) → Pic^d(C), where Pic^d(C) is the space of divisor classes of degree d on C. Pic^d(C) is a torsor for the Jacobian of C, Jac(C), and is isomorphic to it as a variety.\n\nThe fiber of the Abel-Jacobi map over a class [D] ∈ Pic^d(C) is the projective space |D| = P(H^0(C, O(D))) of effective divisors linearly equivalent to D.\n\nBy the Riemann-Roch theorem, the dimension of this projective space is given by:\ndim |D| = h^0(C, O(D)) - 1 = (d - g + 1) + h^1(C, O(D)) - 1.\n\nBy Serre duality, h^1(C, O(D)) = h^0(C, O(K_C - D)), where K_C is the canonical divisor. The degree of K_C is 2g - 2.\nIf d > 2g - 2, then deg(K_C - D) = (2g - 2) - d < 0, which implies that h^0(C, O(K_C - D)) = 0.\n\nIn our case, C has genus g = 3 and we are considering the d = 15th symmetric power. We check the condition:\nd = 15 > 2g - 2 = 2(3) - 2 = 4.\nThe condition is satisfied. Therefore, h^1(C, O(D)) = 0 for all D of degree 15.\n\nThis means that for every class [D] in Pic^15(C), the dimension of the corresponding vector space of sections is constant:\nh^0(C, O(D)) = d - g + 1 = 15 - 3 + 1 = 13.\n\nConsequently, the fiber of the Abel-Jacobi map p: C^(15) → Pic^15(C) is always a projective space of dimension 13 - 1 = 12. This map makes X = C^(15) into a P^12-bundle over the Jacobian variety Jac(C) (which is isomorphic to Pic^15(C)).\n\n### Rank of the Néron-Severi Group\nFor a projective variety B and a vector bundle E over it, the Néron-Severi group of the projectivization P(E) is related to that of B. The rank of the Néron-Severi group, also known as the Picard number ρ, follows the rule:\nρ(P(E)) = ρ(B) + 1.\n\nIn our case, X = C^(15) is a P^12-bundle over Jac(C), so we have:\nρ(X) = ρ(C^(15)) = ρ(Jac(C)) + 1.\n\nNow, the problem is reduced to finding the minimum and maximum possible values for the rank of the Néron-Severi group of the Jacobian of a genus 3 curve.\n\n### Smallest Possible Rank\nThe rank of the Néron-Severi group of the Jacobian of a curve C, ρ(Jac(C)), depends on the specific properties of C. For a \"very general\" curve C of genus g, its Jacobian Jac(C) is a simple abelian variety with the minimal possible ring of endomorphisms, End(Jac(C)) = Z. In this case, the Néron-Severi group NS(Jac(C)) is generated by the class of the canonical theta divisor, and its rank is 1.\n\nThe existence of such curves is a standard result in the theory of moduli of algebraic curves. The locus of curves whose Jacobians have a larger Picard number forms a proper subvariety in the moduli space M_3 of genus 3 curves.\n\nTherefore, the minimum possible rank for the Néron-Severi group of Jac(C) is:\nmin ρ(Jac(C)) = 1.\n\nThis gives the smallest possible rank for X:\nSmallest rank ρ(X) = min ρ(Jac(C)) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2.\n\n### Largest Possible Rank\nThe rank of the Néron-Severi group of an abelian variety A of dimension g is bounded by the Hodge number h^(1,1)(A). For the Jacobian of a curve of genus g, we have:\nh^(1,1)(Jac(C)) = g^2.\n\nFor a genus 3 curve, this gives an upper bound:\nρ(Jac(C)) ≤ 3^2 = 9.\n\nThis maximum is achieved for curves whose Jacobian has maximal complex multiplication. This occurs when Jac(C) is isogenous to the cube of an elliptic curve with complex multiplication (CM), i.e., Jac(C) ~ E^3 for a CM elliptic curve E. In this case, the algebra of endomorphisms End(Jac(C)) ⊗ Q is isomorphic to the algebra of 3x3 matrices over an imaginary quadratic field, M_3(K). The sub-algebra of symmetric endomorphisms (with respect to the Rosati involution) has rank g^2 = 9. It is known that the rank of the Néron-Severi group is equal to the rank of this algebra.\n\nSuch curves exist. A notable example is the Fermat quartic curve, defined by the equation x^4 + y^4 + z^4 = 0 in the projective plane. This is a smooth curve of genus 3. Its Jacobian is known to be isogenous to the cube of the elliptic curve y^2 = x^3 - x, which has complex multiplication by the Gaussian integers Z[i]. For this curve, the rank of the Néron-Severi group of its Jacobian is 9.\n\nTherefore, the maximum possible rank for the Néron-Severi group of Jac(C) is:\nmax ρ(Jac(C)) = 9.\n\nThis gives the largest possible rank for X:\nLargest rank ρ(X) = max ρ(Jac(C)) + 1 = 9 + 1 = 10.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe smallest possible rank of the Néron-Severi group of X = C^(15) is 2, and the largest possible rank is 10.\n\n<<<Smallest rank: 2\nLargest rank: 10>>>"
