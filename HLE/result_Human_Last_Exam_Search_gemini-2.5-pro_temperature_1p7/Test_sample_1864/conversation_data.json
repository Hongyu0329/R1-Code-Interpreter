    "For a successful five-channel flow cytometry sorting experiment using streptavidin beads for detection with channels for AF350, GFP, PE, AF647, and AF750, a series of essential controls must be prepared to ensure data accuracy, proper compensation, and correct gating. Here is a breakdown of the necessary controls, leading to a total of at least 13 control samples.\n\n### I. Core Controls for any Multicolor Flow Cytometry Experiment (11 samples)\n\nThese controls are fundamental for any multicolor flow cytometry experiment.\n\n*   **1. Unstained Control (1 sample):** This sample consists of cells without any fluorescent labeling. Its purpose is to measure the baseline autofluorescence of the cells, which helps in setting the initial voltage and identifying the true negative population.\n*   **2. Compensation Controls (5 samples):** These are critical for correcting spectral overlap, which is the spillover of a fluorophore's signal into a detector intended for another fluorochrome. A separate single-stained sample is required for each of the five fluorochromes in your panel:\n    *   **AF350 single stain**\n    *   **GFP single stain:** For this, you will use your GFP-expressing cells as the positive control and cells not expressing GFP as the negative control.\n    *   **PE single stain**\n    *   **AF647 single stain**\n    *   **AF750 single stain**\n\n    It's important that these controls are as bright or brighter than the signal in your experimental sample to ensure accurate compensation. Either cells or compensation beads can be used for the antibody-conjugated fluorophores.\n\n*   **3. Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls (5 samples):** FMO controls are essential for accurate gating, especially in complex multicolor experiments. Each FMO control contains all the fluorochromes in your panel, except for one. This allows you to see the spread of all other colors into the \"empty\" channel, helping you to set a precise gate for positive cells. You will need one FMO control for each of your five detection channels.\n\n### II. Specific Controls for Streptavidin and Isotype (2 samples)\n\nWhen using a biotin-streptavidin system for detection, additional controls are necessary to account for potential non-specific binding.\n\n*   **4. Streptavidin-Only Control (1 sample):** This sample includes cells stained only with the fluorescently-labeled streptavidin. It is used to check for any non-specific binding of the streptavidin itself to the cells, which could otherwise lead to false-positive results.\n*   **5. Isotype Control (1 sample):** This control uses a biotinylated antibody of the same isotype (class of immunoglobulin) as your primary antibody, but it is directed against an antigen not present on your cells. This sample is then stained with the fluorescent streptavidin. It helps to determine the level of non-specific binding contributed by the primary antibody.\n\n### III. Additional Recommended Controls\n\nWhile the above are considered essential, the following controls are also highly recommended for a robust experimental design:\n\n*   **Viability Control:** To exclude dead cells, which can non-specifically bind antibodies and have higher autofluorescence, it is crucial to use a viability dye. If you use a viability dye, it becomes one of your colors and requires its own single-stain compensation control. There are viability dyes available that are compatible with your panel, for example, some that emit in the UV (like AF350) or far-red range. If one of your five channels is dedicated to a viability dye, its compensation control is already accounted for in the five single-stain controls mentioned above.\n*   **Biological Controls:** These include cells that are known to be positive for your marker of interest and cells that are known to be negative. These controls confirm that your staining is working as expected and help to validate your gating strategy.\n\nIn summary, for a robust and well-controlled five-channel sorting experiment involving streptavidin, you should prepare a minimum of **13 essential control samples** in addition to your fully stained experimental sample.\n\n<<<13>>>"
