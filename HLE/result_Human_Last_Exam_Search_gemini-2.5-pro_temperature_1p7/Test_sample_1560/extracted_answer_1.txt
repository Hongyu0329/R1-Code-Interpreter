The final state of the system after measurement is probabilistic. It depends on which of the two entangled ququints is measured. The problem involves a non-unitary gate `Q` being applied to one part of an entangled system, which is a valid operation under certain conditions that are met here. The most complete description of the "final state" involves detailing the possible outcomes and their probabilities.

Assuming the gate `Q` is applied to the first ququint (A) of the entangled pair, and then ququint A is measured, the system will collapse into one of the following five states with the specified probabilities:

### Initial State and Transformation

*   **Initial Entangled State:** The two ququints, A and B, begin in a maximally entangled state:
    $|\Psi_{entangled}\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \sum_{i=0}^{4} |i\rangle_A \otimes |i\rangle_B$

*   **Transformed State:** The gate `Q` is applied to ququint A, resulting in the new state $|\Psi'\rangle = (Q \otimes I)|\Psi_{entangled}\rangle$. This new state can be written as:
    $|\Psi'\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{10}} \left( |0\rangle_A \otimes (|1\rangle_B + |3\rangle_B) + |1\rangle_A \otimes (|0\rangle_B + |2\rangle_B) + |2\rangle_A \otimes (|0\rangle_B + |3\rangle_B + |4\rangle_B) + |3\rangle_A \otimes (|1\rangle_B + |4\rangle_B) + |4\rangle_A \otimes |2\rangle_B \right)$

### Final States After Measurement of Ququint A

Upon measuring ququint A in the computational basis $\{|0\rangle, |1\rangle, |2\rangle, |3\rangle, |4\rangle\}$, the entire system collapses. The specific final state is determined by the measurement outcome, which is probabilistic.

*   **Outcome 1 (Probability: 1/5 or 20%)**
    If ququint A is measured as $|0\rangle_A$, the final state of the system is:
    $|\text{Final State}_1\rangle = |0\rangle_A \otimes \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|1\rangle_B + |3\rangle_B)$

*   **Outcome 2 (Probability: 1/5 or 20%)**
    If ququint A is measured as $|1\rangle_A$, the final state of the system is:
    $|\text{Final State}_2\rangle = |1\rangle_A \otimes \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rangle_B + |2\rangle_B)$

*   **Outcome 3 (Probability: 3/10 or 30%)**
    If ququint A is measured as $|2\rangle_A$, the final state of the system is:
    $|\text{Final State}_3\rangle = |2\rangle_A \otimes \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}(|0\rangle_B + |3\rangle_B + |4\rangle_B)$

*   **Outcome 4 (Probability: 1/5 or 20%)**
    If ququint A is measured as $|3\rangle_A$, the final state of the system is:
    $|\text{Final State}_4\rangle = |3\rangle_A \otimes \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|1\rangle_B + |4\rangle_B)$

*   **Outcome 5 (Probability: 1/10 or 10%)**
    If ququint A is measured as $|4\rangle_A$, the final state of the system is:
    $|\text{Final State}_5\rangle = |4\rangle_A \otimes |2\rangle_B$

In summary, the measurement projects the entangled pair into one of five possible orthogonal states, each retaining entanglement between the definite state of ququint A and a new superposition state of ququint B.
