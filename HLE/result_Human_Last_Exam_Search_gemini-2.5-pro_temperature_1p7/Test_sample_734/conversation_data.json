    "Augustine of Hippo is the Christian theologian who first developed specialized terminology to describe how changes in the laws of nature can occur, a framework applicable to both the virgin birth of Jesus and the alterations in natural laws following the Fall. The key terminology he developed is that of \"seminal reasons\" (*rationes seminales* or *causales*).\n\nAugustine proposed that during the initial creation, God implanted \"seminal reasons\" into matter. These are latent, seed-like principles or potentialities for everything that would come into being in the course of time. This concept allowed Augustine to explain the gradual emergence of new life and phenomena in a way that was consistent with God's initial single act of creation.\n\nThis framework of seminal reasons addresses both miraculous events and the consequences of the Fall:\n\n*   **The Virgin Birth and Miracles:** Augustine argued that miracles are not events contrary to nature in an absolute sense, but are rather the actualization of potencies that God placed within creation from the beginning. According to his thought, a miracle is an event that occurs outside the usual course of nature, brought about by the activation of a \"miraculous potentiality\" within a creature's seminal reasons by a cause hidden in God. While nature follows its ordinary course, God can activate these latent seminal reasons to produce extraordinary events, such as the virgin birth, which transcends the normal laws of reproduction. The incarnation and the virgin birth have been categorized by later theologians who built on Augustine's work as events *supra naturam* (above nature) that find their possibility in this Augustinian framework.\n\n*   **The Fall and Altered Natural Laws:** Augustine also employed a related concept to explain the consequences of the Fall of humanity. He taught that all of humanity was \"seminally present\" in Adam. Therefore, when Adam sinned, the \"seminal nature\" of humanity was vitiated, or corrupted. This corruption, known as original sin, is then passed down through the generations, leading to a disharmony in human nature and in humanity's relationship with the rest of creation. Before the Fall, human bodies were perfectly subject to the will, but afterward, humanity experienced disobedient desires and became subject to death, representing a significant alteration in the \"natural\" human condition.\n\nAugustine was the first Christian thinker to systematically develop this philosophical and theological framework to reconcile the belief in a divinely ordered, consistent nature with the occurrence of unique, divinely-caused events and the profound change in the state of humanity and the world due to sin.\n\n<<<Augustine of Hippo>>>"
