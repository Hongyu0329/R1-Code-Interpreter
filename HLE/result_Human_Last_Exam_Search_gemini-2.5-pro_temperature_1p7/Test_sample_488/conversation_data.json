    "Based on the theory of conceptual metaphors, as developed by George Lakoff and Mark Johnson, metaphors are not just linguistic devices but fundamental to how we think and structure our understanding of the world. They identify three main types of conceptual metaphors: structural, ontological, and orientational.\n\n1.  **Structural metaphors** are cases where one complex, abstract concept is structured and understood in terms of another, often more concrete, concept. The classic example is ARGUMENT IS WAR, where we talk about and experience arguments using the language of battle, with concepts like winning, losing, attacking positions, and defending claims. Another common example is LOVE IS A JOURNEY, which structures our understanding of a relationship with a path, crossroads, and a destination.\n\n2.  **Ontological metaphors** involve treating abstract concepts—such as emotions, ideas, or events—as if they were physical objects, substances, or entities. This allows us to refer to, quantify, or otherwise interact with them as if they were concrete. For example, in the phrase \"you're wasting my time,\" TIME IS treated as a limited resource, an object that can be spent or wasted. Treating love as a commodity or an object would be an ontological metaphor.\n\n3.  **Orientational metaphors** organize a system of concepts in relation to each other, primarily through spatial orientation (e.g., up-down, in-out, front-back). These are grounded in our physical experiences. For example, we connect happiness with an upward orientation (e.g., \"I'm feeling up\") and sadness with a downward one (e.g., \"His spirits sank\"). This category is about giving a concept a spatial orientation relative to the speaker or the world.\n\nAnalyzing the phrase \"my love for humanity,\" we see that the abstract emotion of \"love\" is being conceptualized as having a direction. The preposition \"for\" indicates that the love is directed from the speaker outward, toward \"humanity.\" This act of giving an abstract concept a direction or orientation in metaphorical space is the key characteristic of an orientational metaphor. It places the emotion within a spatial framework, moving from a source to a destination. While it is not a simple \"up\" or \"down\" orientation, it is a form of spatialization, specifically an outward orientation of an emotion.\n\nTherefore, \"my love for humanity\" is an example of an orientational metaphor.\n\n<<<C>>>"
