    "To fully identify the Permutation of the Last Layer (PLL) case on a 3x3 Rubik's Cube while using the CFOP method, a solver must observe a minimum of three non-top-facing stickers. This allows for the differentiation of all 21 possible PLL scenarios.\n\nPLL is the final step in the CFOP method, where the pieces of the last layer are permuted into their correct positions after being oriented. The recognition of the specific PLL case is crucial for selecting the correct algorithm to solve the cube. This recognition is typically done by observing the arrangement of the stickers on the side faces of the top layer.\n\nAdvanced speedcubers often employ a technique called \"2-Sided PLL Recognition,\" which, as the name suggests, involves looking at only two adjacent side faces of the last layer to identify the case. On two adjacent faces, there are a total of six non-top-facing stickers: four corner stickers and two edge stickers. While viewing all six of these stickers is sufficient to identify any PLL case, it is not always necessary to see all of them.\n\nThe minimum number of stickers required for identification is dictated by the need to distinguish between the most similar PLL cases. By analyzing the patterns of all 21 PLLs, it can be determined that in some instances, observing as few as three specific stickers is enough to uniquely identify the case. For example, the position and color of the two corner stickers and one edge sticker on a single face can provide enough information to differentiate certain cases.\n\nHowever, to guarantee the identification of *any* of the 21 cases, a solver must be prepared to observe at least three stickers. This is because some cases are distinguished by subtle differences that can only be caught by observing a combination of corner and edge sticker relationships. While many cases can be recognized with fewer visual cues, the worst-case scenario necessitates the information provided by at least three stickers to ensure accuracy and avoid misidentification, which would lead to applying an incorrect algorithm.\n\nExperienced cubers learn to recognize patterns such as \"headlights\" (two corner stickers of the same color on a face), \"blocks\" (a corner and adjacent edge of the same color), and the relationships between colors on adjacent faces to quickly deduce the PLL case. The ability to do this from a minimal number of visual cues is a key skill in reducing the pause between the OLL (Orientation of the Last Layer) and PLL steps, thereby improving overall solve times.\n\n<<<3>>>"
