    "The maximal number of prime implicants for a Boolean function of *n* variables, denoted as a(*n*), is given by the formula 2<sup>(*n*-1)</sup>.\n\nFor a 4-variable Boolean function, where *n* = 4, the calculation is as follows:\n\na(4) = 2<sup>(4-1)</sup> = 2<sup>3</sup> = 8.\n\nTherefore, the maximal number of prime implicants of a Boolean function of 4 variables is 8.\n\n<<<8>>>"
