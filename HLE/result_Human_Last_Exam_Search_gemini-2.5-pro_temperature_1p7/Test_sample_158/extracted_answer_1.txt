1.  **Required Permeability:** The permeability of the material in the shell must be `μ` such that `μ² = -μ₀²`. This means the relative permeability `μ_r = μ/μ₀` must be `μ_r = ±i`. For passive metamaterials, the specific value is often taken as `μ_r = -1`.

2.  **Interior Magnetic Field:** The magnetic field in the interior region (ρ < R₁) is uniform, directed oppositely to the applied external field, and has a magnitude scaled by the ratio of the squares of the radii:
    `H_int = -(R₁²/R₂²) * H₀` in the x-direction.
