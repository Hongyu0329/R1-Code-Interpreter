    "To compute the continued fraction associated with the generalized Markov number \\( m_{4/7} \\), we first need to understand the relationship between rational numbers and Markov numbers. The classical Markov numbers are positive integer solutions to the Diophantine equation \\(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 3xyz\\). There is a known correspondence that links rational numbers between 0 and 1 to Markov numbers. A similar relationship exists for generalized Markov numbers.\n\nA common interpretation in this context is to first determine the finite simple continued fraction of the rational number and then use its coefficients to form a periodic infinite continued fraction. This periodic continued fraction represents a quadratic irrational number, which is intrinsically linked to the corresponding Markov-type problem.\n\nFirst, we compute the simple continued fraction of \\( \\frac{4}{7} \\). The Euclidean algorithm, which is the foundational method for finding continued fractions, is used as follows:\n*   \\( \\frac{4}{7} = 0 + \\frac{1}{\\frac{7}{4}} \\)\n*   \\( \\frac{7}{4} = 1 + \\frac{3}{4} = 1 + \\frac{1}{\\frac{4}{3}} \\)\n*   \\( \\frac{4}{3} = 1 + \\frac{1}{3} \\)\n\nThis sequence of operations gives the partial quotients of the continued fraction. Thus, the finite continued fraction for \\( \\frac{4}{7} \\) is \\([0; 1, 1, 3]\\).\n\nThe generalized Markov number \\( m_{4/7} \\) is associated with the quadratic irrational number whose continued fraction is formed by making the sequence of partial quotients \\((1, 1, 3)\\) periodic. This results in the infinite continued fraction \\([0; \\overline{1, 1, 3}]\\). This expression is equivalent to \\([0; 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, \\dots]\\). An irrational number with a periodic continued fraction is a quadratic irrational, meaning it is a root of a quadratic equation with integer coefficients.\n\nTherefore, the continued fraction associated with the generalized Markov number \\( m_{4/7} \\) is \\([0; \\overline{1, 1, 3}]\\).\n\n<<<[0; 1, 1, 3]>>>"
