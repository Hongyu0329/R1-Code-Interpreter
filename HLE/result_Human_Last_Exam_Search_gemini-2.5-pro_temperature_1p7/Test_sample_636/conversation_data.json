    "To solve this problem, we need to find a state feedback gain matrix `F` such that the eigenvalues of the closed-loop system matrix `A + BF` are at `-1 + j` and `-1 - j`.\n\n**1. Define the System Matrices:**\nThe given matrices are:\n`A = [[-1, 1], [1, 0]]`\n`B = [[1, 2], [1, 0]]`\n\n**2. Desired Characteristic Polynomial:**\nThe desired eigenvalues are a complex conjugate pair: `λ₁ = -1 + j` and `λ₂ = -1 - j`.\nThe desired characteristic polynomial `p(s)` can be found from these eigenvalues:\n`p(s) = (s - λ₁)(s - λ₂)`\n`p(s) = (s - (-1 + j))(s - (-1 - j))`\n`p(s) = ((s + 1) - j)((s + 1) + j)`\n`p(s) = (s + 1)² - j²`\n`p(s) = s² + 2s + 1 - (-1)`\n`p(s) = s² + 2s + 2`\n\n**3. Closed-Loop System Characteristic Polynomial:**\nLet the state feedback gain matrix be `F`. Since `A` is 2x2 and `B` is 2x2, `F` must be a 2x2 matrix for the matrix multiplication `BF` to be valid. Let `F` be:\n`F = [[f₁, f₂], [f₃, f₄]]`\n\nThe closed-loop system matrix is `A_cl = A + BF`:\n`BF = [[1, 2], [1, 0]] * [[f₁, f₂], [f₃, f₄]] = [[f₁ + 2f₃, f₂ + 2f₄], [f₁, f₂]]`\n`A + BF = [[-1, 1], [1, 0]] + [[f₁ + 2f₃, f₂ + 2f₄], [f₁, f₂]]`\n`A + BF = [[-1 + f₁ + 2f₃, 1 + f₂ + 2f₄], [1 + f₁, f₂]]`\n\nThe characteristic polynomial of a 2x2 matrix `M` is given by `s² - tr(M)s + det(M) = 0`. For our closed-loop matrix `A + BF`, we have:\n`tr(A + BF) = (-1 + f₁ + 2f₃) + f₂ = f₁ + f₂ + 2f₃ - 1`\n`det(A + BF) = f₂(-1 + f₁ + 2f₃) - (1 + f₂ + 2f₄)(1 + f₁)`\n`det(A + BF) = -f₂ + f₁f₂ + 2f₂f₃ - (1 + f₁ + f₂ + f₁f₂ + 2f₄ + 2f₁f₄)`\n`det(A + BF) = -1 - f₁ - 2f₂ - 2f₄ + 2f₂f₃ - 2f₁f₄`\n\nBy comparing the coefficients of the calculated polynomial `s² - tr(A+BF)s + det(A+BF)` with the desired polynomial `s² + 2s + 2`, we get:\n1.  `-tr(A + BF) = 2`  => `-(f₁ + f₂ + 2f₃ - 1) = 2` => `f₁ + f₂ + 2f₃ = -1`\n2.  `det(A + BF) = 2`  => `-1 - f₁ - 2f₂ - 2f₄ + 2f₂f₃ - 2f₁f₄ = 2` => `-f₁ - 2f₂ - 2f₄ + 2f₂f₃ - 2f₁f₄ = 3`\n\nThis gives us a system of two non-linear equations with four unknowns. This means the system is underdetermined, and there are multiple possible solutions for `F`. We can find one solution by making a simplifying assumption.\n\n**4. Finding a Solution:**\nLet's simplify the problem by assuming that the second row of F is zero, i.e., `f₃ = 0` and `f₄ = 0`. This is equivalent to only using the first control input.\nWith `f₃ = 0` and `f₄ = 0`, the system of equations becomes:\n1.  `f₁ + f₂ + 2(0) = -1` => `f₁ + f₂ = -1`\n2.  `-f₁ - 2f₂ - 2(0) + 2f₂(0) - 2f₁(0) = 3` => `-f₁ - 2f₂ = 3`\n\nNow we have a system of two linear equations with two unknowns (`f₁`, `f₂`):\na) `f₁ + f₂ = -1`\nb) `-f₁ - 2f₂ = 3`\n\nAdding the two equations together:\n`(f₁ + f₂) + (-f₁ - 2f₂) = -1 + 3`\n`-f₂ = 2`\n`f₂ = -2`\n\nSubstitute `f₂ = -2` into equation (a):\n`f₁ + (-2) = -1`\n`f₁ = 1`\n\nSo, with our assumption, the feedback gain matrix is `F = [[1, -2], [0, 0]]`.\n\n**5. Verification:**\nLet's verify this solution.\n`F = [[1, -2], [0, 0]]`\n`A + BF = A + [[1, 2], [1, 0]] * [[1, -2], [0, 0]]`\n`A + BF = [[-1, 1], [1, 0]] + [[1, -2], [1, -2]]`\n`A + BF = [[0, -1], [2, -2]]`\n\nThe characteristic equation is `det(sI - (A + BF)) = 0`:\n`det([[s, 1], [-2, s + 2]]) = s(s + 2) - (1)(-2) = s² + 2s + 2 = 0`\nThis is the desired characteristic polynomial, which has roots at `-1 ± j`.\nTherefore, the calculated state feedback gain `F` is a valid solution.\n\n<<<[[1, -2],]>>>"
