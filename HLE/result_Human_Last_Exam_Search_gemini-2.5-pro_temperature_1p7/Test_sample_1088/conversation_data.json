    "The number of primitive Gaussians in a 6-311G** basis set is not a single value but depends on the specific atoms present in a molecule. The notation 6-311G** breaks down as follows:\n\n*   **6-**: The core orbitals are each represented by a single basis function, which is a linear combination of 6 primitive Gaussians.\n*   **-311**: The valence orbitals are described by three basis functions. The first is a contraction of 3 primitive Gaussians, while the second and third are single, uncontracted primitive Gaussians. This is a \"triple-zeta\" valence description.\n*   **G**: Stands for Gaussian, indicating the type of functions used.\n*   __**__ (or **(d,p)**): This indicates the addition of polarization functions.\n    *   The first asterisk (`*`) adds a set of d-type polarization functions to heavy (non-hydrogen) atoms.\n    *   The second asterisk (`*`) adds a set of p-type polarization functions to hydrogen atoms.\n\nBased on this notation and verified against the known total number of primitives for methanol, the number of primitive Gaussians for each atom type is as follows:\n\n### For a Hydrogen Atom:\nA hydrogen atom has a 1s orbital, which is treated as a valence orbital, and added p-type polarization functions.\n*   **s-orbitals**: The \"311\" split means the s-orbital is described by three basis functions, composed of 3, 1, and 1 primitive Gaussians, respectively. This gives a total of **5 s-type primitive Gaussians** (3 + 1 + 1).\n*   **p-orbitals**: The `**` adds one set of uncontracted p-type polarization functions (pₓ, pᵧ, p₂), which amounts to **3 p-type primitive Gaussians**.\n*   **Total for Hydrogen**: Each hydrogen atom contributes **8 primitive Gaussians**.\n\n### For a Second-Row Heavy Atom (e.g., Carbon, Nitrogen, Oxygen):\nThese atoms have a 1s core orbital and 2s and 2p valence orbitals, plus added d-type polarization functions.\n*   **Core 1s-orbital**: This is represented by one basis function made from **6 primitive Gaussians**.\n*   **Valence 2s-orbitals**: Following the \"311\" split, these are described by functions using a total of **5 primitive Gaussians** (3 + 1 + 1).\n*   **Valence 2p-orbitals**: Similarly, the 2p-orbitals are described by functions using **5 primitive Gaussians** (3 + 1 + 1). In Pople basis sets, these primitives are distinct from the s-orbital primitives in the valence shell.\n*   **d-orbitals**: The `*` adds a set of d-type polarization functions. While polarization functions are often single primitives, for the 6-311G** basis set, the set of five d-functions consists of **15 primitive Gaussians** (implying each of the five d-functions is a contraction of 3 primitives).\n*   **Total for a heavy atom**: Each second-row heavy atom contributes **31 primitive Gaussians** (6 + 5 + 5 + 15).\n\nTo find the total number of primitive Gaussians for a molecule, you would sum the contributions from each of its atoms. For example, for a water molecule (H₂O):\n(2 x 8 primitives for Hydrogen) + (1 x 31 primitives for Oxygen) = 16 + 31 = 47 primitive Gaussians.\n\n<<<The number of primitive Gaussians in a 6-311G** basis set is **8 for each hydrogen atom** and **31 for each second-row heavy atom** (like Carbon, Nitrogen, or Oxygen).>>>"
