    "The Hopf charge, a topological invariant of a three-dimensional vector field, can be determined using the Whitehead integral formula. However, a more intuitive and often simpler method is to calculate the linking number of the preimages of two distinct points on the target space, which is the unit sphere S² in this case. The vector field (nx, ny, nz) represents a mapping from the 3D space (x, y, z) to this unit sphere.\n\nThe components of the vector field are given by:\n*   nx = sin(G)cos(f)\n*   ny = sin(G)sin(f)\n*   nz = cos(G)\n\nHere, `f` and `G` act as the azimuthal and polar angles on the S² sphere, respectively.\n\nTo find the Hopf charge, we identify the preimages in the 3D space that map to two different points on the sphere. A convenient choice is the North Pole (0, 0, 1) and the South Pole (0, 0, -1).\n\n*   **Preimage of the North Pole (nz = 1):** For `nz` to be 1, `cos(G)` must be 1. This implies that `G` must be an even multiple of π, so `G = 2kπ` for some integer `k`. According to the definition `G = π * exp(-10*r2)`, for `G` to be 0 (for `k=0`), `exp(-10*r2)` must be 0. This occurs when `r2` approaches infinity. The condition `r2` → ∞ is met as the distance from the origin in the (x, y, z) space goes to infinity. Therefore, the preimage of the North Pole is the sphere at infinity.\n\n*   **Preimage of the South Pole (nz = -1):** For `nz` to be -1, `cos(G)` must be -1. This means `G` must be an odd multiple of π, so `G = (2k+1)π`. For `G = π` (for `k=0`), `exp(-10*r2)` must be 1. This requires `r2` to be 0. The definition of `r2` is `sqrt((x*x + y*y - 0.5)^2 + z*z)`. For `r2` to be 0, both terms under the square root must be zero. This gives us `z=0` and `x*x + y*y = 0.5`. This equation describes a circle in the z=0 plane with a radius of sqrt(0.5).\n\nThe Hopf charge is equivalent to the linking number of these two preimages. The preimages are the sphere at infinity and a circle of radius sqrt(0.5) in the xy-plane. The linking number of a closed loop (the circle) and a sphere that encloses it at infinity is 1.\n\nThus, the Hopf charge of the given vector field is 1.\n\n<<<1>>>"
