    "To determine the area of the smallest square that can outcircle the figure made by the given parametric curve, we first need to understand the shape of the curve.\n\nThe curve is defined in two parts:\n1.  For the interval $t \\in [0, \\pi]$, the parametric equations are $x = \\cos(t)$ and $y = \\sin(t)$. This represents the upper half of a unit circle centered at the origin, as confirmed by trigonometric identities.\n2.  For the interval $t \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$, the equations are $x = \\cos(t)$ and $y = 5\\sin(t)$. This corresponds to the lower half of an ellipse centered at the origin, with a semi-minor axis of 1 along the x-axis and a semi-major axis of 5 along the y-axis.\n\nNext, we find the maximum and minimum coordinates of the figure to determine its overall dimensions.\n\n*   **X-coordinates:** The x-values are given by $x = \\cos(t)$ for the entire interval $t \\in [0, 2\\pi)$. The range of the cosine function over this interval is from -1 to 1. Thus, the figure extends from $x = -1$ to $x = 1$, giving it a total width of $1 - (-1) = 2$.\n\n*   **Y-coordinates:**\n    *   For $t \\in [0, \\pi]$, $y = \\sin(t)$. The sine function ranges from 0 to 1 in this interval.\n    *   For $t \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$, $y = 5\\sin(t)$. In this interval, $\\sin(t)$ ranges from -1 to 0. Therefore, $5\\sin(t)$ ranges from -5 to 0.\n    *   Combining the two parts, the full range for y is from -5 to 1. This gives the figure a total height of $1 - (-5) = 6$.\n\nThe smallest square that can circumscribe this figure must have a side length equal to the larger of its width and height. The width of the figure is 2, and the height is 6. The larger of these two dimensions is 6.\n\nTherefore, the side length of the smallest circumscribing square is 6. The area of this square is the side length squared.\n\nArea = $6 \\times 6 = 36$.\n\n<<<36>>>To determine the area of the smallest square that can outcircle the figure made by the given parametric curve, we first need to understand the shape of the curve.\n\nThe curve is defined in two parts:\n1.
