    "The surname of the English poet that appears in the Russian text of Joseph Brodsky's essay \"Journey to Istanbul\" when describing a boulevard is Pope.\n\nIn the essay, Brodsky describes a wide, empty boulevard in Istanbul, which he expected to be in the spirit of Vienna. He notes the absence of pedestrians on the sidewalks to his right and left. The original Russian text concludes the description with a pun: \"...И справа, и слева, — бормотал я про себя, переводя взгляд с проносившихся мимо автомобилей на пустой тротуар, — были у него ПОПЫ.\"\n\nThe word \"ПОПЫ\" (popy) is a plural form of \"поп\" (pop), which means \"priest\" in Russian. Phonetically, \"ПОПЫ\" sounds identical to the surname of the 18th-century English poet Alexander Pope. The sentence plays on this, literally stating there were \"priests/Popes\" on either side of him, alluding to the emptiness of the sidewalks.\n\n<<<Pope>>>"
