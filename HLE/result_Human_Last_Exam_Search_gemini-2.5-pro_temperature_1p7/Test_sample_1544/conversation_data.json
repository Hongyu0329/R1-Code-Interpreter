    "The search results provide information on how to use chess engines and interpret their analysis, but they do not directly provide the solution for the specific FEN position. I was expecting to find an online FEN analyzer that would give me the best move. Since the search results are general, I will use my own analysis, which I am confident in.\n\nThe position is: `8/3p4/1kpP4/p1q5/P7/8/5Q2/6K1 w - - 0 1`\n\nWhite to move.\n\nAs identified in my initial thoughts, the key to this position is White's passed d-pawn. The most direct and winning move for White is to trade queens, removing Black's main defensive and counter-attacking piece.\n\nThe move is **Qxc5+**.\n\nAfter White plays `Qxc5+`, Black is forced to recapture with `...Kxc5`. The resulting position is a pawn endgame:\n\n`8/3p4/2kP4/p7/P7/8/8/6K1 w - - 0 2` (if it were white to move, which it would be) -> `8/3p4/2kP4/p7/P7/8/8/6K1 b - - 1 1`\n\nNow the position becomes:\n\n- **White:** King on g1, Pawn on a4, Pawn on d6\n- **Black:** King on c5, Pawn on a5, Pawn on d7\n\nIt is now Black's turn to move after recapturing the queen. Let's analyze the pawn race. Black's king is well-placed to stop the d-pawn. For instance:\n\n1. Qxc5+ Kxc5\n\nNow it's White's turn again. No, after Kxc5, it's white's move. Let me recheck the sequence.\n\nThe sequence starts with White to move.\n1. `Qxc5+`\nBlack's only legal move is `...Kxc5`.\n\nAfter `1...Kxc5`, it becomes White's move. The FEN would be:\n`8/3p4/3P4/2k5/P7/8/8/6K1 w - - 0 2`\n\nWhite now needs to bring the king over to support the pawn.\n2. `Kf2`\n\nBlack's king can either go after the d-pawn or try to create counterplay.\nIf `2...Kxd6`, then `3. Ke3` and White's king will round up the d7 pawn and easily win.\n\nSo, Black must try something else.\n`2...Kb4` (attacking the a4 pawn)\n`3. Ke3`\n`3...Kxa4`\n`4. Kd4`\nNow White's king is heading for the d-pawn, and will support its promotion. Black's king is on a4 and is too far away to stop the d-pawn. Black can try to create a passed a-pawn, but White's king is active enough to deal with all threats and secure the win.\n\nFor instance:\n`4...Kb3`\n`5. Kc5 a4`\n`6. d7 a3`\n`7. d8=Q a2`\n`8. Qb6+` followed by `Qb2` or capturing the a-pawn. The resulting Queen vs. pawn endgame is an easy win for White.\n\nLet's re-examine my assumption that `Qxc5+` is best.\nWhat if White does *not* trade queens?\nFor example `Qe3`. Black can play `Qc2`. This creates threats against `a4` and the White king. White has to be careful. The resulting positions are much more complex and give Black chances for counterplay that are absent in the pawn endgame.\n\nGiven the simplicity and clarity of the win after the queen trade, `Qxc5+` is undoubtedly the optimal move.\n\nI am confident in this answer.\n<<<Qxc5+>>>"
