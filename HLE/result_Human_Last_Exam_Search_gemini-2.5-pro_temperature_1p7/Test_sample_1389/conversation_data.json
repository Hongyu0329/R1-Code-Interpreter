    "An all-or-nothing vaccine is a type of vaccine that provides complete protection to a certain percentage of the vaccinated population, while the rest of the vaccinated individuals receive no protection and remain as susceptible as unvaccinated individuals. This is in contrast to a \"leaky\" vaccine, which provides partial protection to all vaccinated individuals.\n\nVaccine efficacy (VE) is typically calculated in clinical trials as 1 minus the incidence rate ratio (IRR) or 1 minus the relative risk (RR). The incidence rate ratio is the incidence of disease in the vaccinated group divided by the incidence in the unvaccinated group.\n\nIn an all-or-nothing model, if a fraction 'p' of vaccinated individuals are completely protected, the incidence rate in the vaccinated group will be proportional to the fraction that is not protected, which is (1-p). The incidence rate ratio (IRR) therefore becomes (1-p). The vaccine efficacy measured as `1 - IRR` would then be `1 - (1-p) = p`. This means the standard vaccine efficacy calculation estimates the proportion of vaccinated individuals who are fully protected.\n\nPer-exposure vaccine efficacy is defined as the reduction in the probability of infection per single exposure to the pathogen for a vaccinated individual compared to an unvaccinated one. To understand this in the context of an all-or-nothing vaccine, we consider the average effect across the entire vaccinated population:\n*   For the proportion 'p' that is fully protected, the reduction in risk per exposure is 100%.\n*   For the proportion '(1-p)' that is not protected, the reduction in risk per exposure is 0%.\n\nThe average per-exposure efficacy for the entire vaccinated group is the weighted average: `(p * 100%) + ((1-p) * 0%) = p * 100%`.\n\nTherefore, the population-level measure of `1 - incidence rate ratio` (which equals 'p') is numerically identical to the average per-exposure vaccine efficacy (which also equals 'p'). Both \"leaky\" and \"all-or-nothing\" vaccines can lead to an equal instantaneous reduction in population susceptibility by reducing the per-exposure infection risk. Thus, for an all-or-nothing vaccine, the 1-incidence rate ratio correctly estimates the per-exposure vaccine efficacy.\n\n<<<C>>>"
