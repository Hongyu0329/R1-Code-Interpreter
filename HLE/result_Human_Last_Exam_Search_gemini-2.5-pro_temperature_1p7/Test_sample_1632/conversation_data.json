    "A self-avoiding walk is a path on a lattice that does not visit the same point more than once. The \"Manhattan lattice\" is another term for the square lattice (ℤ²), where movement is restricted to horizontal and vertical steps of unit length.\n\nThe number of n-step self-avoiding walks, denoted as a(n), is a well-studied quantity in computational physics and mathematics. While there is no known simple formula to calculate a(n) for any given n, its values have been computed and tabulated for a range of n through various numerical methods.\n\nBased on tabulated data for the number of self-avoiding walks on a square lattice, the value for a 10-step walk is 44,100.\n\n<<<44100>>>"
