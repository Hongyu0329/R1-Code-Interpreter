    "The minimal number of triangles required for the triangulation of the outer-hull of the great icosahedron is 20.\n\nThe outer-hull, or convex hull, of the great icosahedron is a regular icosahedron. A regular icosahedron is a polyhedron composed of 20 triangular faces. Since the surface of the outer-hull is already made up of triangles, the most straightforward and minimal triangulation is the set of these faces themselves. Therefore, 20 triangles are needed.\n\nThe great icosahedron itself is a non-convex polyhedron with 20 intersecting triangular faces. The parts of these faces that are visible from the outside are numerous small triangular regions called \"facelets\". However, the question specifically asks about the triangulation of the outer-hull, which is the encompassing regular icosahedron.\n\n<<<20>>>"
