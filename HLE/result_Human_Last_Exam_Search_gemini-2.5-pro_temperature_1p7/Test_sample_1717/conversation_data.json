    "The initial search has provided some useful information, but a precise formula for the health scaling is still missing.\n\nHere's a breakdown of what I've found:\n*   In Expert Mode, the Eye of Cthulhu's base health for a single player is 3,640.\n*   Boss health scales with the number of players in Expert and Master Mode.\n*   A forum post from 2015 provides some data points for the Eye of Cthulhu's health with different numbers of players in Expert Mode.\n*   Another post in the same thread mentions looking into the source code and suggests that each boss has its own scaling. It provides a table of health values for the Eye of Cthulhu for up to 10 players, but not the underlying formula.\n*   The data from these forum posts seems consistent. For example, for 2 players, the health is listed as 4,913 or 4,914, and for 3 players, it's 6,976.\n\nThe crucial piece of missing information is the exact health scaling formula from the source code. While the forum posts give me data points, I need the formula to determine the health for an *infinite* number of players.\n\nMy next step will be to search specifically for the health scaling formula as it appears in the Terraria source code. I will broaden my search terms to include general boss health scaling in case the formula is not specific to the Eye of Cthulhu.The search results have provided crucial information, including a description of the health scaling formula. A forum post on the Terraria Community Forums provides a detailed breakdown of how boss health scales with the number of players in Expert Mode.\n\nHere's a summary of the findings:\n\n*   **Base Health:** The Eye of Cthulhu has a base health of 3,640 in single-player Expert Mode.\n*   **2 Players:** For two players, there's a 35% health increase, resulting in 1.35 times the base health.\n*   **3 to 9 Players:** For each additional player from 3 to 9, the health increase is calculated based on the previous boost. The formula for the additional boost for the *n*th player is `(1 - previous_boost) / 3`. This is then added to the previous total boost.\n*   **10+ Players:** For 10 or more players, the formula is modified to be less drastic. The multiplier is calculated as `[(unmodified_multiplier * 2 + 8) / 3]`.\n*   **Player Limit:** A standard Terraria server has a player limit of 255.\n\nThe forum post provides a clear, step-by-step calculation of the health multiplier. I can use this information to calculate the theoretical maximum health with an infinite number of players.\n\nLet M(n) be the health multiplier for *n* players.\nLet B(n) be the cumulative boost for *n* players.\n\nFor n = 1, M(1) = 1. Health = 3640.\nFor n = 2, the boost is 0.35. M(2) = 1 + 0.35 = 1.35.\nFor n > 2, the additional boost for the nth player is `(1 - B(n-1)) / 3`.\nB(n) = B(n-1) + additional boost.\nM(n) = 1 + B(n).\n\nIt appears the iterative formula for the total multiplier for `n` players (where `n` >= 3) is: `TotalMultiplier(n) = TotalMultiplier(n-1) + (PreviousBoost(n-1) + (1 - PreviousBoost(n-1)) / 3)`. However, the forum post gives a more direct calculation of the overall multiplier for each player count.\n\nFor 10 or more players, there is a softening of the scaling. Let's analyze the multiplier for `n` approaching infinity. The post mentions that the multiplier for 255 players is approximately 171.36.\n\nLet's look at the formula for n >= 10: `ModifiedMultiplier = [(UnmodifiedMultiplier * 2 + 8) / 3]`.\nAs *n* approaches infinity, the unmodified multiplier also approaches infinity.\n\nLet U(n) be the unmodified multiplier for n players. The recursive formula for the boost suggests that the increase gets smaller with each player, but it continues to increase.  The formula `ModifiedMultiplier = (2/3) * UnmodifiedMultiplier + 8/3` is a linear transformation.  As the unmodified multiplier grows, the modified multiplier will also grow.\n\nThe crucial piece is how the unmodified multiplier grows.  The post mentions the formula goes on until the multiplier reaches x1000, which isn't achieved in standard Terraria. This implies the formula is known to have a limit or at least a projected value.\n\nLet `b_n` be the boost for `n` players.\n`b_1 = 0`\n`b_2 = 0.35`\n`b_n = b_{n-1} + (1 - b_{n-1}) / 3 = (2/3)b_{n-1} + 1/3` for `3 <= n < 10`\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The fixed point is `L = (2/3)L + 1/3`, which gives `(1/3)L = 1/3`, so `L=1`. As `n` increases, `b_n` approaches 1.  So for a large number of players (before the formula changes at n=10), the total boost approaches 100%.\n\nFor n >= 10, the formula changes.  Let M_n be the total multiplier for n players.\nThe provided information says \"This goes on until the multiplier reaches x1000\". This suggests there isn't a simple asymptotic limit and that for an \"infinite\" number of players, the health would also be infinite.\n\nLet's re-examine the source of this information. The forum post seems to have deciphered the logic from the source code.\n\nGiven the formula for `n >= 10`:\n`M_n_modified = (2 * M_n_unmodified + 8) / 3`\nLet's assume the unmodified multiplier continues with the recurrence. As `n -> infinity`, the unmodified multiplier `U_n` approaches `n` * some constant factor. So `U_n` would tend to infinity.  Then `M_n_modified` would also tend to infinity.\n\nTherefore, the theoretical maximum health for an infinite number of players is infinite.\n\nLet's confirm this logic. The provided formulas indicate a continuous increase in the health multiplier with each player. The \"softening\" of the formula for 10 or more players still results in an increase. Since there's no cap on the number of players in the theoretical scenario, the health will continue to increase without bound.\n\nFinal Answer Check: The question is about the *theoretical* maximum health given an *infinite* number of players. The formulas provided do not show a horizontal asymptote for the health multiplier as the number of players increases.  Therefore, the health would increase indefinitely.Based on the health scaling mechanics of Terraria for Expert Mode, the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu with an infinite number of players would also be infinite. Here is a breakdown of the reasoning:\n\nIn Expert Mode, the Eye of Cthulhu starts with a base health of 3,640 for a single player. The health of bosses increases in multiplayer for each additional player.\n\nThe health scaling formula changes as more players join:\n*   **For the second player**, a health boost of 35% is added.\n*   **For players 3 through 9**, the health multiplier increases with each player, though the rate of increase diminishes. The formula for the additional boost for the *n*th player is based on the previous player's boost.\n*   **For 10 or more players**, a different formula is used to \"soften\" the increase, but the health multiplier continues to grow with each player. The formula for the multiplier for `n` players (where n â‰¥ 10) is `[(unmodified_multiplier * 2 + 8) / 3]`.\n\nCrucially, none of the formulas for health scaling have an upper limit or approach a specific maximum value as the number of players increases. As the number of players (*n*) approaches infinity, the health multiplier also increases without bound. A forum analysis of the game's code confirms that this multiplier continues to increase, and projects a multiplier of approximately 171.36 for 255 players, the standard server limit.\n\nSince the health multiplier for the Eye of Cthulhu grows indefinitely with the number of players, its theoretical maximum health is infinite.\n\n<<<Infinite>>>"
