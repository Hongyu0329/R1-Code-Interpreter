    "Until 1883, the Pantheon was flanked by two bell towers, a unique architectural feature of the \"Piazza della Rotonda\" in Rome. These towers were not removed in 1950, as the question states, but were demolished in 1883.\n\nThe bell towers were added to the Pantheon in the 17th century, under the direction of the architect Gian Lorenzo Bernini, during the papacy of Urban VIII. However, they were not well-received by the Roman populace, who mockingly referred to them as \"the ass's ears.\"\n\nA series of works to \"free\" the Pantheon from various additions and isolate it from other buildings took place in the late 19th century. It was during this period, specifically in 1883, that the controversial bell towers were demolished, significantly altering the appearance of the Piazza della Rotonda and the Pantheon itself.\n\nThere is no historical evidence to support the claim that a unique architectural feature was removed from the square in 1950. The most significant architectural removal from the direct vicinity of the Pantheon was the demolition of the twin bell towers in the late 19th century. Various other clearances of sheds, shops, and houses occurred in the 15th and 19th centuries.\n\n<<<The two bell towers, known as \"the ass's ears\", which were demolished in 1883.>>>"
