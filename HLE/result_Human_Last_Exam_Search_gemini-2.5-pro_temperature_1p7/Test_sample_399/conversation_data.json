    "To find the value of x(1) for the given initial value problem, we first need to solve the differential equation.\n\nThe given differential equation is:\n$x'(t) = (t-1) \\cdot x^2(t)$\n\nThis can be written as:\n$\\frac{dx}{dt} = (t-1)x^2$\n\nThis is a separable differential equation. The first step is to separate the variables by moving all terms involving x to one side and all terms involving t to the other side.\n$\\frac{1}{x^2} dx = (t-1) dt$\n\nNext, we integrate both sides of the equation.\n$\\int \\frac{1}{x^2} dx = \\int (t-1) dt$\n\nThe integral of $\\frac{1}{x^2}$ with respect to x is $-\\frac{1}{x}$. The integral of $(t-1)$ with respect to t is $\\frac{t^2}{2} - t$.\nSo, the integration yields:\n$-\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + C$\nwhere C is the constant of integration.\n\nNow, we use the initial condition $x(0) = -8$ to find the value of C.\n$-\\frac{1}{(-8)} = \\frac{0^2}{2} - 0 + C$\n$\\frac{1}{8} = C$\n\nSubstitute the value of C back into the general solution:\n$-\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + \\frac{1}{8}$\n\nNow, we can solve for x(t):\n$\\frac{1}{x} = -(\\frac{t^2}{2} - t + \\frac{1}{8})$\n$\\frac{1}{x} = -\\frac{t^2}{2} + t - \\frac{1}{8}$\n\nTo find x(1), we substitute t=1 into the equation:\n$\\frac{1}{x(1)} = -\\frac{1^2}{2} + 1 - \\frac{1}{8}$\n$\\frac{1}{x(1)} = -\\frac{1}{2} + 1 - \\frac{1}{8}$\n$\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{8}$\n$\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{4}{8} - \\frac{1}{8}$\n$\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{3}{8}$\n\nFinally, we solve for x(1):\n$x(1) = \\frac{8}{3}$\n\n<<<8/3>>>"
