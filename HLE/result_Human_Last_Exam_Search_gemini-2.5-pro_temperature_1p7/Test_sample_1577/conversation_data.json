    "The ground state degeneracy of the toric code depends on the topology of the surface on which it is defined. This degeneracy is a hallmark of topological order and is robust against local perturbations. When holes are introduced, they create boundaries which alter the topology and therefore the degeneracy. There are two primary types of boundaries: smooth (also called dual) and rough (also called primal).\n\nThe degeneracy can be calculated by determining the number of independent logical operators that commute with the Hamiltonian. For a surface with `m` rough holes and `n` smooth holes, a common physical interpretation leads to the following conclusion:\n\n*   **Rough Holes:** Each rough hole provides a location where logical string operators can terminate. For `m` rough holes on a non-compact surface (like a plane), this introduces `m` independent logical qubits. A system with `m` qubits has a degeneracy of 2^m.\n*   **Smooth Holes:** Each smooth hole also introduces a new type of logical operator. While a string-like operator cannot terminate on a smooth boundary, a loop operator that wraps around the hole commutes with the Hamiltonian and is not a product of local stabilizers. This means each of the `n` smooth holes also contributes a factor of 2 to the degeneracy.\n\nCombining these two contributions, the total ground space degeneracy (GSD) is the product of the degeneracies from each type of hole:\n\nGSD = (Degeneracy from rough holes) × (Degeneracy from smooth holes)\nGSD = (2^m) × (2^n)\nGSD = 2^(m+n)\n\nThis formula correctly predicts the degeneracy for a single rough hole (GSD = 2¹ = 2) and implies a degeneracy of 2 for a single smooth hole, a result which is consistent with the existence of a non-trivial loop operator.\n\n<<<A>>>"
