    "The Grigorchuk group has exactly 7 subgroups of index 4. This conclusion is reached by understanding a key property of the group: its abelianization.\n\nThe number of subgroups of a specific index in a group is closely related to its homomorphisms onto finite groups. For an abelian group, the number of subgroups of a given index can be determined more directly. A crucial fact about the Grigorchuk group is that its abelianization, which is the largest abelian quotient of the group, is the elementary abelian group of order 8, denoted as (C₂)³ or C₂ × C₂ × C₂.\n\nAny homomorphism from a group to an abelian group must factor through its abelianization. This means that to count the subgroups of index 4 in the Grigorchuk group, we can instead count the number of subgroups of index 4 in its abelianization, (C₂)³.\n\nAn elementary abelian 2-group, like (C₂)³, has the property that every element, other than the identity, has an order of 2. A subgroup of index 4 in a group of order 8 must have an order of 8 / 4 = 2. To find the number of subgroups of order 2, we can count the number of elements of order 2. In (C₂)³, there are 8 elements in total. Excluding the identity element, the remaining 7 elements all have an order of 2.\n\nEach subgroup of order 2 is generated by a single non-identity element. Since each such subgroup contains the identity and one element of order 2, the number of subgroups of order 2 is equal to the number of elements of order 2. Therefore, the elementary abelian group (C₂)³ has 7 subgroups of order 2.\n\nSince the number of subgroups of index 4 in the Grigorchuk group is the same as the number of subgroups of index 4 in its abelianization, we can confidently state that the Grigorchuk group has 7 subgroups of index 4.\n\n"
