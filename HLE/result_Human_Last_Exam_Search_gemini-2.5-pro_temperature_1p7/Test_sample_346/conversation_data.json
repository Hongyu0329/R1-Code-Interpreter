    "To find the value of `log_2(n)`, we first need to determine the integer `n` represented by the given SKI combinator expression.\n\nThe expression is:\n`S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(S(S(K(S))(K))(I)))))(S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I))))`\n\n### Step 1: Identify and Simplify Known Combinators\n\nFirst, we identify the standard combinators for Church numerals, which are used to represent numbers as functions.\n*   **Successor (`succ`)**: The combinator `S(S(K(S))(K))` is the successor function. It takes a Church numeral `n` and returns `n+1`.\n*   **One (`1`)**: The `I` combinator is equivalent to the Church numeral for 1.\n*   **Two (`2`)**: The expression `S(I)(I)` represents the Church numeral for 2. It applies a function `f` to a value `x` twice (`f(f(x))`).\n\n### Step 2: Simplify the Expression Components\n\nNow we can simplify the parts of the main expression:\n*   `S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I))` is `succ(2)`, which evaluates to the Church numeral **3**.\n*   `S(S(K(S))(K))(I)` is `succ(1)`, which evaluates to the Church numeral **2**.\n\nSubstituting these back into the original expression gives:\n`S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(2))))(3))`\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate the Simplified Expression\n\nLet's define a new combinator `D = S(I)`. The reduction rule for `D` when applied to two arguments `x` and `y` is `D x y = S(I) x y = x(x y)`.\n\nThe expression can now be written as:\n`D(D(D(K(2))))(3)`\n\nTo evaluate this, we will analyze the structure from the inside out:\n1.  Let `F_0 = K(2)`. The `K` combinator is a constant function; it takes two arguments and returns the first. So, `K(2)(y) = 2` for any `y`.\n2.  Let `F_1 = D(F_0) = D(K(2))`. When `F_1` is applied to an argument `y`, it evaluates to `K(2)(K(2) y)`. Since `K(2) y = 2`, the expression becomes `K(2)(2)`, which is `2`. Therefore, `F_1` is also a combinator that always returns `2`, meaning `F_1 = K(2)`.\n3.  Let `F_2 = D(F_1)`. Since `F_1` was shown to be equivalent to `K(2)`, `F_2 = D(K(2))`, which is also `K(2)`.\n4.  Similarly, `F_3 = D(F_2) = D(K(2))`, which simplifies to `K(2)`.\n\nSo, the entire expression `D(D(D(K(2))))` is equivalent to the constant function combinator `K(2)`.\n\nThe final expression to evaluate is `K(2)(3)`. According to the definition of the `K` combinator, this evaluates to **2**.\n\nTherefore, the Church integer `n` represented by the expression is 2.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Final Result\n\nThe question asks for the value of `log_2(n)`.\nWith `n = 2`, the calculation is:\n`log_2(2) = 1`\n\n<<<1>>>"
