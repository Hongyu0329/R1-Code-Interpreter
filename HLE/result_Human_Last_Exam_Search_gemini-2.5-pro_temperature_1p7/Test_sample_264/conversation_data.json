    "Let the first cube, C1, be represented by the region in 3D space where 0 ≤ x ≤ 1, 0 ≤ y ≤ 1, and 0 ≤ z ≤ 1. The side length of this cube is 1.\n\nThe main diagonal of this cube connects the origin (0,0,0) to the opposite vertex (1,1,1). The vector representing this diagonal is **d** = (1, 1, 1).\n\nThe problem states that the second cube, C2, is shifted by 1/2 along this main diagonal relative to the first. This can be interpreted in a couple of ways, but the most common interpretation in such geometry problems is that the shift is half of the diagonal's vector components. This means the shift vector is **v** = (1/2, 1/2, 1/2).\n\nSo, the second cube, C2, is the first cube translated by the vector **v**. This means its coordinates are defined by:\n0 + 1/2 ≤ x ≤ 1 + 1/2  =>  1/2 ≤ x ≤ 3/2\n0 + 1/2 ≤ y ≤ 1 + 1/2  =>  1/2 ≤ y ≤ 3/2\n0 + 1/2 ≤ z ≤ 1 + 1/2  =>  1/2 ≤ z ≤ 3/2\n\nThe volume of the intersection of the two cubes is the volume of the region where the coordinates satisfy the conditions for both C1 and C2. We find the overlapping range for each coordinate:\n*   **x-axis:** The intersection of and [1/2, 3/2] is [1/2, 1]. The length of this interval is 1 - 1/2 = 1/2.\n*   **y-axis:** The intersection of and [1/2, 3/2] is [1/2, 1]. The length of this interval is 1 - 1/2 = 1/2.\n*   **z-axis:** The intersection of and [1/2, 3/2] is [1/2, 1]. The length of this interval is 1 - 1/2 = 1/2.\n\nThe intersection of the two cubes is therefore a smaller cube with a side length of 1/2.\n\nThe volume of this intersection cube is calculated as:\nVolume = (side length)³ = (1/2)³ = 1/8.\n\n<<<1/8>>>"
