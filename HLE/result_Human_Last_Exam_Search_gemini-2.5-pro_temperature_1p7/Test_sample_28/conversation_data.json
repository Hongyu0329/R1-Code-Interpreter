    "To determine the VC dimension of the hypothesis class $H_{z-ones}$, we need to find the size of the largest set of points $S \\subseteq X$ that can be shattered by $H_{z-ones}$.\n\nLet's define the hypothesis class and the domain first:\n*   $X$ is the domain of size $T$, so $|X| = T$.\n*   $H_{z-ones} = \\{h: X \\to \\{0,1\\} : |\\{x \\in X : h(x)=1\\}| = z\\}$, where $z$ is a positive integer. This means every hypothesis in the class must label exactly $z$ points as positive (1) and $T-z$ points as negative (0).\n\nThe VC dimension is the largest integer $d$ such that there exists a subset $S \\subseteq X$ with $|S|=d$ which is shattered by $H_{z-ones}$. A set $S$ is shattered if for every possible binary labeling of the points in $S$, there is a hypothesis in $H_{z-ones}$ that can produce that labeling.\n\nLet's find an upper bound on the VC dimension.\nSuppose a set $S \\subseteq X$ with size $|S| = d$ can be shattered. This means for any of the $2^d$ possible labelings of the elements in $S$, we can find a corresponding hypothesis in $H_{z-ones}$.\n\n1.  Consider the labeling where all $d$ points in $S$ are labeled as '1'. To accommodate this labeling, a hypothesis $h \\in H_{z-ones}$ must assign '1' to all points in $S$. The total number of points labeled '1' by $h$ must be exactly $z$. This implies that the number of points in $S$ must be less than or equal to $z$. Therefore, we must have $d \\le z$.\n\n2.  Consider the labeling where all $d$ points in $S$ are labeled as '0'. To accommodate this, a hypothesis $h \\in H_{z-ones}$ must assign '0' to all points in $S$. This hypothesis must still label a total of $z$ points as '1', which must all be chosen from the set of points outside of $S$, i.e., from $X \\setminus S$. The size of this complement set is $|X \\setminus S| = T - d$. For it to be possible to choose $z$ points from this set, the number of available points must be at least $z$. Thus, we must have $T-d \\ge z$, which implies $d \\le T-z$.\n\nFor a set of size $d$ to be shattered, both conditions must be met. Therefore, $d$ must satisfy both $d \\le z$ and $d \\le T-z$. This means that the size of any shatterable set is at most $\\min(z, T-z)$. This gives us an upper bound on the VC dimension:\nVCdim$(H_{z-ones}) \\le \\min(z, T-z)$.\n\nNow, let's establish a lower bound by showing that a set of size $d = \\min(z, T-z)$ can be shattered.\nLet $d = \\min(z, T-z)$ and let's pick any subset $S \\subseteq X$ with $|S| = d$. We want to show that for any binary labeling of the points in $S$, there exists a hypothesis $h \\in H_{z-ones}$ that implements this labeling.\n\nLet a given labeling of $S$ have $k$ points labeled '1' and $d-k$ points labeled '0', where $0 \\le k \\le d$.\nTo construct a hypothesis $h$ for this labeling, we need to define the labels for the points in $X \\setminus S$ such that the total number of points labeled '1' across all of $X$ is exactly $z$.\nSince we already have $k$ points in $S$ labeled '1', we need to label exactly $z-k$ more points as '1' from the complement set $X \\setminus S$. The remaining points in $X \\setminus S$ will be labeled '0'.\nThis construction is possible if and only if we can choose $z-k$ points from the $T-d$ points in $X \\setminus S$. This requires the number of points to choose, $z-k$, to be non-negative and no more than the number of available points, $T-d$. So we must satisfy:\n$0 \\le z-k \\le T-d$ for all possible values of $k$ (i.e., for $k = 0, 1, \\dots, d$).\n\nLet's check these two inequalities:\n1.  **Is $z-k \\ge 0$?** This is equivalent to $k \\le z$. Since we chose $d=\\min(z, T-z)$, we know $d \\le z$. As $k$ can be at most $d$, we have $k \\le d \\le z$. So, this condition holds.\n\n2.  **Is $z-k \\le T-d$?** This is equivalent to $d+k \\le T-z$. Let's re-arrange it to $d+z-T \\le k$. This inequality must hold for all $k \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, d\\}$. The condition is most stringent for the smallest possible value of $k$, which is $k=0$. So, we must check if $d+z-T \\le 0$, or $d \\le T-z$. Since we chose $d = \\min(z, T-z)$, we know that $d \\le T-z$ is true by definition. As the inequality holds for $k=0$, it will hold for all $k > 0$ as well.\n\nSince both conditions are satisfied for any choice of labeling (any $k$ from $0$ to $d$), we can always construct the required hypothesis. Thus, any set of size $d = \\min(z, T-z)$ can be shattered. This establishes the lower bound:\nVCdim$(H_{z-ones}) \\ge \\min(z, T-z)$.\n\nCombining the upper and lower bounds, we conclude that the VC dimension is exactly $\\min(z, T-z)$.\n\n<<<$\\min(z, T-z)$>>>"
