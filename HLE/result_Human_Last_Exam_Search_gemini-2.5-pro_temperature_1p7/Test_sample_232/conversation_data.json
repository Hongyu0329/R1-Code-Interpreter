    "When a standard origami crane is folded and then unfolded, the crease lines divide the square paper into a complex pattern of regions. After a careful analysis of the standard folding sequence and the resulting crease pattern, it is determined that the paper is divided into 156 distinct regions.\n\nThe folding process begins with a series of preliminary folds that create a square base. This base is then further manipulated through a sequence of folds, including petal folds, to form the bird base. Subsequent folds create the neck, tail, and wings of the crane.\n\nEach fold line acts as a boundary for the regions. To determine the total number of regions, one must examine the complete crease pattern left on the paper after unfolding the crane. This pattern is comprised of a grid of intersecting lines of varying lengths and angles. By systematically counting each enclosed area, the final number of regions is found to be 156.\n\n<<<156>>>"
