    "The symmetry group of the optimal packing of 1135 congruent circles in a circle is C₁. This is based on the data provided by Eckard Specht's \"packomania.com\", a comprehensive database of circle packing information.\n\nThe table of best-known packings of equal circles in a circle on this website specifies that the symmetry group is given in Schoenflies notation. It also states that if the field for the symmetry group is empty, the packing has a C₁ symmetry element. The entry for 1135 circles does not list a specific symmetry group, therefore its symmetry is C₁.\n\n<<<C₁>>>"
