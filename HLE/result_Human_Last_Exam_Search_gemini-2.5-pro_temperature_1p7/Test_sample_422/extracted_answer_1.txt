When the only epistemic states are Knowledge and Belief under the JTB framework, two problems that arise, independent of Gettier cases, are:

1.  **The Infinite Regress of Justification:** The JTB model requires a belief to be justified to count as knowledge. However, the justification itself must be based on other beliefs, which in turn must also be justified. This creates an infinite regress, where no belief can ever be fundamentally justified. If the chain of justification does not have a solid foundation, no belief can ever be sufficiently justified to transition from the state of "Belief" to "Knowledge".

2.  **The Infallibility of the Truth Condition:** The "truth" component of the JTB definition poses a problem of certainty. For a belief to become knowledge, it must be objectively true. In a binary system of only Belief and Knowledge, this implies that one must be certain of the belief's truth. This high standard leads to a dilemma: either one adopts a dogmatic stance, claiming an impossible level of certainty about what is true, or one falls into skepticism, concluding that since such certainty is unattainable, nothing can ever be truly known, and we are perpetually confined to the state of "Belief".
