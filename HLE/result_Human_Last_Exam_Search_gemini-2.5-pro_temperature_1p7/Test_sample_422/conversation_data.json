    "When knowledge is defined as Justified True Belief (JTB) and the only available epistemic states are \"Knowledge\" and \"Belief,\" two significant problems arise that are distinct from Gettier-style examples.\n\nThe two problems are:\n1.  **The Problem of Infinite Regress in Justification:** The \"justification\" component of the JTB theory is not clearly defined in terms of its endpoint. For a belief to be justified, it must be supported by other beliefs. However, those supporting beliefs would also require justification, leading to an infinite backward chain of justifications. This creates a logical puzzle: either the chain of justification goes on forever, meaning no belief is ever fully justified, or it must end at some point. If it ends, it must terminate in a \"foundational\" belief. Within a strict binary system of only Knowledge and Belief, this foundational belief presents a dilemma. If it is not justified, it is merely a Belief and cannot serve as a secure foundation to justify all other beliefs into Knowledge. If it is self-justifying, then the definition of justification becomes circular. Therefore, this regress problem makes it impossible for any belief to be ultimately justified and to make the leap from \"Belief\" to \"Knowledge\".\n\n2.  **The Problem of Infallibility Required by the \"Truth\" Condition:** The \"truth\" condition for knowledge is absolute and external to the believer's mind. A person has access to their beliefs and their reasons for them, but not to the ultimate, objective truth of a proposition. In a system limited to Belief and Knowledge, for a belief to become Knowledge, it must be true. This implies that the knower must be in a position to be certain of its truth. This creates a dichotomy: either we must claim a god-like, infallible access to truth to say we \"know\" something, leading to dogmatism, or we must accept that because we can never be absolutely certain about the objective truth of any belief, we can never attain Knowledge at all, leaving us in a state of perpetual belief. For instance, many things that were once considered \"knowledge\" (like the belief that the sun orbited the Earth) were based on the best justification available but turned out to be false. This suggests that what we often call knowledge is not infallible and that requiring absolute truth to transition from Belief to Knowledge sets an impossible standard.\n\n<<<\nWhen the only epistemic states are Knowledge and Belief under the JTB framework, two problems that arise, independent of Gettier cases, are:\n\n1.  **The Infinite Regress of Justification:** The JTB model requires a belief to be justified to count as knowledge. However, the justification itself must be based on other beliefs, which in turn must also be justified. This creates an infinite regress, where no belief can ever be fundamentally justified. If the chain of justification does not have a solid foundation, no belief can ever be sufficiently justified to transition from the state of \"Belief\" to \"Knowledge\".\n\n2.  **The Infallibility of the Truth Condition:** The \"truth\" component of the JTB definition poses a problem of certainty. For a belief to become knowledge, it must be objectively true. In a binary system of only Belief and Knowledge, this implies that one must be certain of the belief's truth. This high standard leads to a dilemma: either one adopts a dogmatic stance, claiming an impossible level of certainty about what is true, or one falls into skepticism, concluding that since such certainty is unattainable, nothing can ever be truly known, and we are perpetually confined to the state of \"Belief\".\n>>>"
