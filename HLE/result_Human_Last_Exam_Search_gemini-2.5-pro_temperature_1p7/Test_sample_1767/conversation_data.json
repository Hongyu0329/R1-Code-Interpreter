    "When two Chern insulators, each with a Chern number of 1, are connected laterally with a negligible tunneling barrier, they form a combined system. The Chern number of this resulting junction is the sum of the individual Chern numbers.\n\nA Chern insulator is a two-dimensional material characterized by a topological invariant known as the Chern number (C). This integer value dictates the number of chiral edge states, which are one-dimensional conducting channels that exist at the boundaries of the material. For a Chern insulator with C=1, there is a single chiral edge state.\n\nWhen two such systems are joined together, the topological properties of the combined system are determined by the sum of the individual Chern numbers. This principle is illustrated by the concept of a quantum spin Hall insulator, which can be understood as being composed of two Chern insulator systems with opposite Chern numbers (C=1 and C=-1), resulting in a total Chern number of zero.\n\nIn the scenario presented, two Chern insulators with C=1 are brought into lateral contact. With a negligible tunneling barrier, they effectively merge into a single, larger system. The Chern number of this composite system is therefore:\n\nC_total = C_1 + C_2 = 1 + 1 = 2\n\nThis combined system, or junction, is a Chern insulator with a Chern number of 2. A key consequence is that the new, larger system will have two chiral edge states along its outer boundaries. At the specific interface where the two original insulators meet, the number of interfacial edge states is determined by the difference in their Chern numbers, which is |1 - 1| = 0. This means no new conducting channels are formed at the internal junction.\n\n<<<2>>>"
