    "The value computed between heartbeats is called the **inter-beat interval (IBI)**.\n\nHeart Rate Variability (HRV) is the physiological phenomenon of variation in the time interval between consecutive heartbeats. This variation is a measure of the body's ability to respond to stress and environmental changes. While electrocardiography (ECG) is considered the gold standard for measuring HRV, photoplethysmography (PPG) is also a widely used method.\n\nWhen HRV is calculated from an ECG, the time between the R-peaks of the QRS complex is measured and referred to as the R-R interval. In the context of PPG, which detects changes in blood volume, the time between consecutive pulses is measured. This is known as the inter-beat interval or IBI. The IBI is typically measured in milliseconds. Therefore, when using PPG to track beat-to-beat intervals for HRV analysis, the value computed between heartbeats is the inter-beat interval (IBI).\n\n<<<inter-beat interval (IBI)>>>"
