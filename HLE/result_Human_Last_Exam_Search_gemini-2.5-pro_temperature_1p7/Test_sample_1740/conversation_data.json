    "To date, the let-7 family in humans consists of 10 mature microRNAs (miRNAs). These members are derived from 12 to 13 precursor genes located on different chromosomes.\n\nThe identified mature let-7 miRNAs in humans are:\n*   let-7a\n*   let-7b\n*   let-7c\n*   let-7d\n*   let-7e\n*   let-7f\n*   let-7g\n*   let-7i\n*   miR-98\n*   miR-202\n\nSome sources may refer to 9, 11, or 12 members, which can be due to variations in counting the precursor genes or the mature miRNAs. However, multiple sources confirm the presence of 10 distinct mature let-7 family members in humans.\n\nThe let-7 family is highly conserved across many species and plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression, including genes involved in cell proliferation and differentiation. Misregulation of the let-7 family has been linked to the development of cancers.\n\n<<<10>>>"
