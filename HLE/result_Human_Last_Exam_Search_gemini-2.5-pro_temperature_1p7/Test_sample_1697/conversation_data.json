    "The reaction of N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide with sec-BuLi and TMEDA, followed by methyl iodide, proceeds in two key steps.\n\nFirst, a directed *ortho*-metalation (DoM) occurs. The starting molecule has two directing metalation groups (DMGs) on the benzene ring: a tertiary amide (-CONEt₂) and a tertiary amine (-NMe₂). The combination of sec-butyllithium (sec-BuLi), a strong base, and TMEDA facilitates the removal of the most acidic aromatic proton.\n\nThe N,N-diethylcarboxamide group at position 1 directs the lithiation to its *ortho* positions (C2 and C6), and the dimethylamino group at position 3 directs to its *ortho* positions (C2 and C4). The tertiary amide is a stronger directing group than the tertiary amine. More importantly, both groups cooperatively direct the metalation to the C2 position, which is *ortho* to both. This cooperative effect makes the proton at C2 the most acidic and the most reactive site for lithiation. Consequently, sec-BuLi removes the proton at C2, forming a 2-lithio-N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide intermediate.\n\nIn the second step, this aryllithium intermediate, which is a strong nucleophile, reacts with the electrophile, methyl iodide (CH₃I). The nucleophilic carbon at C2 attacks the methyl group of methyl iodide, displacing the iodide and forming a new carbon-carbon bond.\n\nThe final compound obtained is N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide.\n\n<<<N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide>>>"
