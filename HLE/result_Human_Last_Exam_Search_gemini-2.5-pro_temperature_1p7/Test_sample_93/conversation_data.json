    "The number of non-negative integer solutions to the Diophantine equation \\(x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2 + x_4^2 + x_5^2 = 2024\\) can be determined by simplifying the equation first.\n\nSince the sum of the five squares is the even number 2024, the number of odd squares among \\(x_1^2, x_2^2, x_3^2, x_4^2, x_5^2\\) must be even. An integer squared is odd if and only if the integer itself is odd, and even if and only if the integer is even. Let's consider the equation modulo 4. The square of an even number is congruent to 0 (mod 4), and the square of an odd number is congruent to 1 (mod 4). The sum of the five squares must be congruent to 2024 (mod 4), which is 0 (mod 4). The sum of the squares modulo 4 is equal to the number of odd integers among \\(x_1, ..., x_5\\). Therefore, the number of odd integers must be 0 or 4.\n\nA more direct simplification can be achieved by observing that if an integer solution exists, all the integers must be of the same parity. Since their sum is even, they cannot all be odd (as the sum of five odd squares would be odd). Therefore, all integers \\(x_i\\) in any integer solution must be even. Let \\(x_i = 2y_i\\) for \\(i=1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\), where \\(y_i\\) are non-negative integers.\n\nSubstituting these into the original equation gives:\n\\((2y_1)^2 + (2y_2)^2 + (2y_3)^2 + (2y_4)^2 + (2y_5)^2 = 2024\\)\n\\(4y_1^2 + 4y_2^2 + 4y_3^2 + 4y_4^2 + 4y_5^2 = 2024\\)\n\nDividing the equation by 4, we get:\n\\(y_1^2 + y_2^2 + y_3^2 + y_4^2 + y_5^2 = 506\\)\n\nThe number of non-negative integer solutions to the original equation is identical to the number of non-negative integer solutions to this simplified equation. The problem is thus reduced to finding the number of ways to represent 506 as the sum of five squares of non-negative integers.\n\nThis quantity, often denoted as \\(N_5(506)\\), is related to the sum of squares function \\(r_5(n)\\), which counts the number of ways to write an integer \\(n\\) as the sum of five squares of any integers (positive, negative, or zero). The formulas for \\(r_5(n)\\) are known in number theory but are generally complex and not straightforward to apply without computational tools.\n\nThe search results indicate that a direct calculation of this value is non-trivial. While some numbers have been studied for their representations as sums of squares, the specific value for 506 is not readily available in the search results. Finding the number of solutions typically requires either a dedicated computational program to enumerate them or the application of advanced mathematical formulas from the theory of modular forms.\n\nDue to the computational nature of the problem, a precise numerical answer cannot be provided based on the conducted web search.\n\n"
