    "A single, planar patch of surface code with a defined boundary and *N* holes (or defects) can encode *N* logical qubits. This is because each hole introduces an additional degree of freedom to the system.\n\nIn the scenario described:\n*   There is one patch of surface code.\n*   This patch has two holes.\n\nTherefore, one patch with two holes can encode 2 logical qubits.\n\nThe question specifies there are **two** such patches. Since the patches are separate and independent, the total number of logical qubits is the sum of the qubits encoded in each patch.\n\n*   **Patch 1:** 2 holes -> 2 logical qubits\n*   **Patch 2:** 2 holes -> 2 logical qubits\n\nTotal logical qubits = 2 + 2 = 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
