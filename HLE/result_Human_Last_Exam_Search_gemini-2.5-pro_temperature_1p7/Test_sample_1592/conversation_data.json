    "The closest province to the Waskaganish gathering place, outside of Quebec, is **Ontario**.\n\nThe Waskaganish Gathering Place is located in the Cree community of Waskaganish, in the Nord-du-Qu√©bec administrative region. This community is situated on the southeastern shore of James Bay.\n\nQuebec shares its western border with the province of Ontario, and the two provinces meet at James Bay. The traditional territories of the Cree people in this region encompass parts of both northern Quebec and Ontario. Given Waskaganish's location on the western side of Quebec, Ontario is the nearest province.\n\nThe other provinces and territories that border Quebec are New Brunswick and Newfoundland and Labrador to the east and southeast, and the territory of Nunavut to the north, across the Hudson Strait. These are all more distant from Waskaganish than Ontario.\n\n<<<Ontario>>>"
