    "The Lviv-Warsaw School philosopher who breaks down the concept of an \"indication\" into \"symptoms\" and \"signals\" is **Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz**.\n\nIn his work on semiotics and the philosophy of language, Ajdukiewicz used the term \"indication\" (oznaka) as a broad category for signs. He then distinguished between two types of indications:\n\n*   **Symptoms:** These are natural signs. A classic example is a barometer falling, which is a symptom of impending rain.\n*   **Signals:** These are artificial or conventional signs created to convey information. An example of this would be a railway signal.\n\nJerzy Pelc, a prominent Polish semiotician, in his analysis of Ajdukiewicz's work, highlights this distinction. He explains that for Ajdukiewicz, when the phrase \"which means\" connects two sentences, the state of affairs described in the first sentence is a symptom of the state of affairs in the second. This same principle applies to signals, which are intentionally created phenomena.\n\nAnother philosopher from the Lviv-Warsaw School, Izydora DÄ…mbska, also explored the concepts of symptoms and signals in her semiotic studies. She noted that silence, for instance, could function as a symptom or a signal depending on the context. However, the foundational decomposition of the broader notion of an indication into these two categories is a recognized part of Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz's contribution to semiotic theory.\n\n<<<Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz>>>"
