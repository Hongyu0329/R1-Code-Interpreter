    "In the poem 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam (The Creed of the Laymen) by Sayyid Ahmad al-Marzuqi, the names of the Prophets in Islam are mentioned from the bayt (verse) starting with \"هُمْ آدَمٌ إِدْرِيسُ نُوحٌ هُودُ مَعْ\" to the bayt ending with \"عِيسَى وَطَهَ خَاتِمٌ دَعْ غَيَّا\".\n\nThe specific verses that list the twenty-five prophets one is obliged to know are as follows:\n\nThe enumeration begins with the verse:\nهُمْ آدَمٌ إِدْرِيسُ نُوحٌ هُودُ مَعْ *** صَالِحْ وَإِبْرَاهِيمُ كُلٌّ مُتَّبَعْ\n(They are Adam, Idris, Nuh, Hud, along with Salih and Ibrahim, each is to be followed)\n\nIt continues through the next two verses, mentioning Lut, Isma'il, Ishaq, Ya'qub, Yusuf, Ayyub, Shu'ayb, Harun, Musa, al-Yasa', Dhu al-Kifl, Dawud, and Sulayman.\n\nThe list concludes with the verse:\nإِلْيَاسُ يُونُسُ زَكَرِيَّا يَحْيَى *** عِيسَى وَطَهَ خَاتِمٌ دَعْ غَيَّا\n(Ilyas, Yunus, Zakariyya, Yahya, 'Isa, and Taha [a name for Prophet Muhammad], the last of them, so leave misguidance)\n\nTherefore, the names of the prophets are detailed across four bayts in the poem.\n\n<<<From the bayt beginning \"هُمْ آدَمٌ إِدْرِيسُ نُوحٌ هُودُ مَعْ\" to the bayt ending \"عِيسَى وَطَهَ خَاتِمٌ دَعْ غَيَّا\".>>>"
