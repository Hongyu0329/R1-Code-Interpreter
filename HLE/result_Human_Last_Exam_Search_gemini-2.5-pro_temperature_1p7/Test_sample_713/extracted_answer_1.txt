The set of possible values for the volume of $P$ is a single value for $d=2$ and a continuous interval for $d \ge 3$.
*   For $d=2$: $\{2V\}$
*   For $d=3$: The interval $[5V, 6V]$ (the upper bound relies on a standing conjecture).
*   For $d \ge 3$: The interval $[R_{reg}(d)V, d!V]$, where $R_{reg}(d)$ is the volume ratio for a regular $d$-simplex and the upper bound of $d!V$ is the conjectured maximum, achieved for an orthoscheme.
