    "For a Lissajous curve defined by the parametric equations x(t) = cos(at) and y(t) = sin(bt), the number of self-intersection points can be determined when 'a' and 'b' are coprime integers. In the given curve, a = 9 and b = 5. These are coprime integers, and both are odd.\n\nThe formula for the number of self-intersection points of a Lissajous curve where both frequencies are odd and coprime is given by (a-1)(b-1)/2.\n\nGiven a = 9 and b = 5:\nNumber of self-intersections = (9 - 1) * (5 - 1) / 2\nNumber of self-intersections = 8 * 4 / 2\nNumber of self-intersections = 32 / 2\nNumber of self-intersections = 16\n\n<<<16>>>"
