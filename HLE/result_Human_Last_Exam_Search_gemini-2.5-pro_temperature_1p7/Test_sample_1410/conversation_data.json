    "The chess position described by the FEN string `4r1k1/ppp2pp1/2n4p/3QN1qB/3P4/2P4P/PP4P1/4rRK1 w - - 0 20` is illegal according to the rules of chess.\n\nThe board state shows the White king on the g1 square. The Black rook on the e1 square is checking the White king. However, the FEN indicates that it is \"w\" (White's) turn to move. In a standard game of chess, a player's king cannot be in check on their turn, as the previous move by the opponent must have moved the king out of check.\n\nBecause the provided position is illegal, the question of how many moves it would take for White to win cannot be answered. The game cannot proceed from this position under standard chess rules.\n\nIt is possible that there is a typographical error in the FEN string provided. A slight change to the position could result in a legal and solvable chess puzzle. However, based on the exact FEN given, no valid sequence of moves can be played.\n\n<<<0>>>"
