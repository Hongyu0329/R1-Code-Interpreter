    "In William Morris's *The House of the Wolfings*, no single character visits a Roman city and then describes their religious practices in a way that directly alludes to Romulus and Remus. Instead, the allusion to the founders of Rome is woven into the narrative through the naming convention the Goths use for the Romans.\n\nThroughout the book, the narrator and the Gothic characters, including the Wolfings, refer to the Romans as the \"children of the Wolf of Rome\". This is a direct reference to the foundational myth of Rome, in which the twin brothers Romulus and Remus were suckled by a she-wolf. This epithet serves to contrast the Romans with the Goths of the House of Wolfings, who are the \"children of the Wolf of the Goths\".\n\nWhile a \"Wolfing man\" does describe a Roman city as \"a garth full of mighty houses, with a wall of stone and lime around it,\" his account focuses on the city's wealth and structure rather than its religious customs. The primary and repeated allusion to Romulus and Remus comes from the name attributed to the Romans by their Gothic adversaries.\n\n<<<No specific character, but the Goths and the narrator refer to the Romans as the \"children of the Wolf of Rome\".>>>"
