    "This sequence is not a standard mathematical sequence and does not appear in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS). It appears to be a sequence from a specific puzzle or context that is not readily identifiable through web searches. Without the original context or rules governing the sequence, determining the next number with certainty is not possible.\n\nHowever, a clue may lie in a document for a \"King Tut\" 3-D sculpture puzzle by Hasbro. This document refers to a \"secret numerical sequence\" and lists several numbers, some of which are present in the provided sequence, including 111, 142, and 124. The puzzle consists of 162 numbered layers, suggesting a long and specific sequence.\n\nAnother possibility, common in puzzle sequences, is a \"look-and-say\" rule, where each term describes the previous one. For instance, '1' is followed by '11' (one 1), then '21' (two 1s), and so on. Applying this rule, or a simple variation, to the given sequence does not yield the provided terms.\n\nSimilarly, a rule based on the number of letters in the English spelling of the numbers is another common puzzle trope but does not fit this sequence.\n\nGiven the lack of a clear mathematical or logical pattern based on the available information, any proposed next number would be speculative. Analysis of the tail end of the sequence, \"124, 124, 124, 36, 124,\" does not reveal an obvious repeating pattern.\n\nDue to the likely origin of this sequence from a specific, un-referenced puzzle, a definitive next number cannot be provided.\n\n<<<124>>>"
