Two languages from distinct Asian cultures with no direct contact that have nearly identical words for "mom" and "dad" are Persian (Farsi) and Tagalog. The informal term for "mom" in Persian is "mâmân" and a common term in Tagalog is "mama". The informal word for "dad" in Persian is "bâbâ", which is very similar to the common Tagalog term "papa". However, the words for "broom" in these two languages are completely different: "jâru" in Persian and "walis" in Tagalog. The similarity in the words for "mom" and "dad" is likely due to the common linguistic phenomenon of these words arising from the first sounds babies make, rather than from cultural exchange.
