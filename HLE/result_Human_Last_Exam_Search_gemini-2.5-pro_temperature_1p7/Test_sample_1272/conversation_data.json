    "Minh General Mu Sheng experienced his first significant defeat in 1408 at the hands of Vietnamese forces led by Trần Ngỗi during the Later Trần dynasty's rebellion against Ming rule. The rebellion was active in the northern part of modern-day Vietnam, which was then known as Jiaozhi province by the Ming.\n\nInitially, the rebellion led by Trần Ngỗi was centered in what is now **Ninh Bình Province**. As the conflict progressed, the rebel forces moved south and gained considerable support in the area of present-day **Thanh Hóa Province**. Mu Sheng was dispatched to quell this uprising but was ultimately defeated by the Vietnamese rebels. Although a single, decisive battle location is not explicitly mentioned in historical accounts, the rebellion's main theaters of operation, and thus the area of Mu Sheng's defeat, were within the modern-day provinces of Ninh Bình and Thanh Hóa.\n\n<<<Ninh Bình and Thanh Hóa provinces>>>"
