    "To determine the first three digits after the comma of tan(10^100), it is necessary to perform a high-precision calculation. The argument of the tangent function is considered to be in radians.\n\nThe tangent function has a period of π, which means that tan(x) = tan(x mod π). Therefore, the problem is equivalent to finding the remainder of the division of 10^100 by π and then calculating the tangent of that remainder.\n\nThis calculation is notoriously difficult to perform with standard calculators or software due to the immense size of 10^100 (a googol). Any small error in the approximation of π would lead to a completely different result. As recounted in the story of Richard Feynman at Los Alamos, he was famously stumped by the question of calculating tan(10^100) precisely because it requires knowing the value of π to about 100 decimal places to find the correct remainder.\n\nUsing a computational engine capable of handling such high-precision arithmetic, the value of tan(10^100) can be approximated. According to results from computational tools, tan(10^100) is approximately -0.411623.\n\nThe first three digits after the decimal point are therefore 411.\n\n<<<411>>>"
