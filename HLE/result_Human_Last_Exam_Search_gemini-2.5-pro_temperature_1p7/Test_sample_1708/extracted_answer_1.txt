The order type of the set of finite strings of characters {a,b,c,d} ordered lexically does not correspond to a simple, common named order type like ω (the order of the natural numbers) or η (the order of the rational numbers). It is a more complex structure characterized by the recursive relation τ = (1+τ) + (1+τ) + (1+τ) + (1+τ), where τ is the order type of the set itself. This is because the set is not well-ordered and not dense.
