    "### Small Molecules Targeting SARS-CoV-2 Nsp14 Identified as Protein-Ligand Interactors with CHEMBL4803817's Target\n\nSmall molecules that form protein-ligand interactions with the protein target of CHEMBL4803817, identified as the SARS-CoV-2 non-structural protein 14 (Nsp14), have been a key focus of antiviral research. Nsp14 is a crucial bifunctional enzyme for the virus, possessing both exoribonuclease (ExoN) and guanine-N7 methyltransferase (N7-MTase) activities, which are essential for viral replication and immune evasion. Various research efforts have led to the discovery and development of a range of small molecule inhibitors that bind to Nsp14.\n\nA number of potent inhibitors have been identified through different discovery strategies. High-throughput screening and subsequent optimization have yielded TDI-015051, a first-in-class non-covalent inhibitor of the Nsp14 methyltransferase activity, which originated from the initial hit RU-0415529. Another study reported the discovery of 32 inhibitors, with five showing significant potency (IC50 values < 10 µM), through large-scale docking of over a billion molecules.\n\nFurthermore, screening of known drugs and other compounds has identified several molecules with antiviral activity attributed to their interaction with Nsp14. These include:\n*   **PF-03882845**\n*   **Inauhzin**\n*   **Trifluperidol**\n*   **Lomeguatrib**\n\nThese compounds were found to be effective in cellular infection models, demonstrating their potential to inhibit viral replication.\n\nIn addition to synthetic compounds, naturally derived molecules have also been investigated. Molecular docking and simulation studies have suggested that tomentosolic acid, timosaponin A-I, and shizukaol A can bind to and potentially inhibit the function of Nsp14.\n\nThe development of adenosine 5′-carboxamide derivatives represents another promising class of Nsp14 inhibitors. Within this series, the compound designated as **18l (HK370)** has shown high selectivity and some antiviral effect in cell-based assays.\n\nThe interaction between Nsp14 and its cofactor Nsp10 is also a target for disruption by small molecules, as this interaction is vital for the exonuclease activity of Nsp14. Moreover, Nsp14 has been found to interact with host proteins such as IMPDH2 and SIRT5, opening up further avenues for therapeutic intervention. The chemical represented by ChEMBL ID CHEMBL4803817, with the molecular formula C24H29N5O3, has been associated with these research efforts targeting Nsp14.\n\n<<<The small molecules that will form some kind of protein-ligand interactions with the chemical represented by ChEMBL ID: CHEMBL4803817 are inhibitors of its protein target, SARS-CoV-2 Nsp14.
