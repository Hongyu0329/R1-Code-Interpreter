    "When the ligand 2,5-di(2-pyridyl)thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole is reacted with *cis*-dichlorobis(bipyridine)ruthenium(II), a dinuclear ruthenium complex is formed, and two stereoisomers are produced.\n\nThe ligand, 2,5-di(2-pyridyl)thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole, acts as a bridge between two chiral *cis*-[Ru(bpy)₂]²⁺ units. Each of these ruthenium centers can have either a delta (Δ) or a lambda (Λ) configuration. This results in the formation of two distinct diastereoisomers:\n\n*   **A meso form (Δ/Λ)**: This isomer contains one ruthenium center with a Δ configuration and the other with a Λ configuration, making the overall molecule achiral due to an internal plane of symmetry.\n*   **A racemic form (rac)**: This is a 1:1 mixture of two enantiomers, one where both ruthenium centers have the Δ configuration (Δ/Δ) and another where both have the Λ configuration (Λ/Λ).\n\nThese two diastereoisomers, the meso and the rac forms, are separable. Research has shown they are formed in a 2:1 ratio.\n\n<<<2>>>"
