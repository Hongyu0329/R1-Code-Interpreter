    "By a continuum, we mean a compact connected metric space. A nondegenerate continuum is one that is not a single point. The largest possible number of a continuum's composants—subsets that are the union of all proper subcontinua containing a specific point—depends on the properties of the two nondegenerate continua being multiplied.\n\nThe number of composants of the product of two nondegenerate continua, X and Y, can be one of three values: 1, c, or 2^c, where 'c' represents the cardinality of the continuum (the number of real numbers). However, a 2012 paper by Piotr Minc demonstrated that the value 2^c is not achievable. This corrected an earlier claim that 2^c was a possible number of a product's composants.\n\nTherefore, the largest possible number of composants for the product of two nondegenerate continua is **c**. Here's a breakdown of how this number is achieved:\n\n*   **One Composant:** If both continua, X and Y, are decomposable (meaning they can be expressed as the union of two proper subcontinua), their product X × Y is also decomposable and will have only one composant. An example of this is the product of two arcs ( x), which forms a square.\n*   **\"c\" Composants:** The number of composants can be 'c' in a couple of scenarios:\n    *   When one continuum is decomposable and the other is indecomposable (cannot be expressed as the union of two proper subcontinua). For instance, the product of an arc and a Knaster continuum (an indecomposable continuum) will have 'c' composants.\n    *   When both continua are indecomposable, their product can be either decomposable (resulting in one composant) or indecomposable (resulting in 'c' composants).\n\nSince the number of composants can be either 1 or 'c', the largest possible value is **c**.\n\n<<<c>>>"
