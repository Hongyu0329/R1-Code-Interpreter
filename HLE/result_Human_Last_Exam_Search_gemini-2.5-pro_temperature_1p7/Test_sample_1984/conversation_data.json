    "To find the number of stable equilibria, we first need to find the equilibrium points of the differential equation\n$$\nx'(t) = -x^{3}(t) + 2x^{2}(t) - x(t).\n$$\nThe equilibrium points are the values of $x$ for which $x'(t) = 0$. Let $f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 - x$. We need to solve $f(x) = 0$:\n$$\n-x^3 + 2x^2 - x = 0\n$$\nFactoring out $-x$ from the expression gives:\n$$\n-x(x^2 - 2x + 1) = 0\n$$\nThe quadratic part is a perfect square, $(x-1)^2$. So the equation becomes:\n$$\n-x(x-1)^2 = 0\n$$\nThe equilibrium points are the solutions to this equation, which are $x_1 = 0$ and $x_2 = 1$.\n\nNext, we need to determine the stability of these equilibrium points. An equilibrium point $x^*$ is stable if for values of $x$ in the neighborhood of $x^*$, the solution $x(t)$ tends towards $x^*$ as $t \\to \\infty$. This can be checked by analyzing the sign of the derivative of $f(x)$, denoted by $f'(x)$. An equilibrium point $x^*$ is stable if $f'(x^*) < 0$.\n\nLet's compute the derivative of $f(x)$:\n$$\nf'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(-x^3 + 2x^2 - x) = -3x^2 + 4x - 1\n$$\nNow we evaluate $f'(x)$ at each equilibrium point.\n\nFor the equilibrium point $x_1 = 0$:\n$$\nf'(0) = -3(0)^2 + 4(0) - 1 = -1\n$$\nSince $f'(0) = -1 < 0$, the equilibrium point $x=0$ is stable.\n\nFor the equilibrium point $x_2 = 1$:\n$$\nf'(1) = -3(1)^2 + 4(1) - 1 = -3 + 4 - 1 = 0\n$$\nSince $f'(1) = 0$, the first derivative test is inconclusive. We need to analyze the sign of $f(x)$ in the vicinity of $x=1$.\nThe function is $f(x) = -x(x-1)^2$.\nFor values of $x$ slightly greater than 1 (e.g., $x = 1 + \\epsilon$ for a small $\\epsilon > 0$):\n$f(1+\\epsilon) = -(1+\\epsilon)((1+\\epsilon)-1)^2 = -(1+\\epsilon)\\epsilon^2 < 0$. This means that if $x > 1$, $x'(t) < 0$, and the solution will move towards $x=1$.\nFor values of $x$ slightly less than 1 (e.g., $x = 1 - \\epsilon$ for a small $\\epsilon > 0$, and we assume $x > 0$):\n$f(1-\\epsilon) = -(1-\\epsilon)((1-\\epsilon)-1)^2 = -(1-\\epsilon)(-\\epsilon)^2 = -(1-\\epsilon)\\epsilon^2 < 0$. This means that if $0 < x < 1$, $x'(t) < 0$, and the solution will move away from $x=1$ (towards $x=0$).\n\nSince solutions on one side of $x=1$ move away from it, the equilibrium point $x=1$ is not stable. It is a semi-stable equilibrium. Therefore, the only stable equilibrium point is $x=0$.\n\nThe number of stable equilibria is $m = 1$.\n\nWe are asked to find the value of $m - 2^{4048}$.\nSubstituting the value of $m=1$, we get:\n$$\n1 - 2^{4048}\n$$\n\n<<<1 - 2^{4048}>>>"
