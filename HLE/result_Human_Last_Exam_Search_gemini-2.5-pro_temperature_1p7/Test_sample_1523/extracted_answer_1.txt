In finite-temperature field theory for a neutral scalar field, the inner product of `(ϕ, D_ϕ)` in the functional integral representation of the partition function is given by the expression:
`(ϕ, D_ϕ) = ∫_0^β dτ ∫ d^3x ϕ(x, τ) [-∂_τ^2 - ∇^2 + m^2] ϕ(x, τ)`
Here, `ϕ(x, τ)` is the scalar field, `β` is the inverse temperature, `τ` is the imaginary time, `∇^2` is the spatial Laplacian, and `m` is the mass of the field. This expression represents the Euclidean action for a free scalar field.
