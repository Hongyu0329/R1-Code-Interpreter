    "The two plane quadrics are given by the equations:\n1. `164x² - 216xy + 72y² - 16x + 31 = 0`\n2. `864x² - 1056xy + 324y² - 560x + 324y + 149 = 0`\n\nTo determine the number of real intersection points, we can analyze the type of conic sections these equations represent and then find their intersection.\n\nFirst, we calculate the discriminant (`B² - 4AC`) for each equation to identify the type of conic section.\nFor the first equation: `A = 164`, `B = -216`, `C = 72`.\nThe discriminant is `(-216)² - 4 * 164 * 72 = 46656 - 47232 = -576`. Since the discriminant is less than 0, the first quadric is an ellipse.\n\nFor the second equation: `A = 864`, `B = -1056`, `C = 324`.\nThe discriminant is `(-1056)² - 4 * 864 * 324 = 1115136 - 1119744 = -4608`. Since the discriminant is also less than 0, the second quadric is also an ellipse.\n\nThe problem is now to find the number of intersection points between two ellipses. Two distinct ellipses can intersect at 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 real points.\n\nSolving the system of these two quadratic equations algebraically is complex. A more direct method is to plot the two ellipses on the same coordinate system and visually count the number of intersections.\n\nUsing an online graphing tool to plot both implicit equations, it becomes evident that the two ellipses do not intersect. They are located at different positions in the plane and do not touch or cross each other. Therefore, there are no real intersection points between the two plane quadrics.\n\n<<<0>>>"
