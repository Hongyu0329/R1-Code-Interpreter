    "In the dwarf cuttlefish (*Sepia bandensis*), the brain regions that lie adjacent and posterior to the palliovisceral lobe are the **posterior chromatophore lobes** and the **dorsal and ventral vasomotor lobes**.\n\nThe central brain of the dwarf cuttlefish is a complex structure with numerous lobes organized into larger masses. The palliovisceral lobe is a key component of the palliovisceral lobe complex, which is located within the subesophageal mass. This subesophageal mass is situated toward the back of the brain, posterior to the esophagus.\n\nDetailed anatomical studies and 3D brain atlases of the dwarf cuttlefish have clarified the arrangement of these lobes. The palliovisceral lobe complex itself is comprised of the palliovisceral lobe, the lateral ventral palliovisceral lobes, the posterior chromatophore lobes, and the dorsal and ventral vasomotor lobes. As their name suggests, the posterior chromatophore lobes are located towards the rear of this cluster. Similarly, the vasomotor lobes are also part of this posterior grouping. Therefore, these lobes are situated adjacently and posteriorly to the main palliovisceral lobe within the brain structure.\n\n<<<The brain regions situated posteriorly to the palliovisceral lobe in the dwarf cuttlefish are the posterior chromatophore lobes and the dorsal and ventral vasomotor lobes.>>>"
