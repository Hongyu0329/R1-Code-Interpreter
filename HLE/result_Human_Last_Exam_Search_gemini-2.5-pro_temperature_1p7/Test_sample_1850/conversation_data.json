    "In John Milton's epic poem *Paradise Lost*, only one historical saint is mentioned by name: **Saint Peter**.\n\nThis reference appears in Book III of the poem. When describing the \"Paradise of Fools,\" a limbo for vain and self-important souls, Milton writes that they may espy on their journey:\n\n\"And now Saint Peter at Heav'ns Wicket seems / To wait them with his Keys\" (Book III, lines 484-485).\n\nThis is a direct and unambiguous reference to the apostle Peter, who is traditionally seen as the gatekeeper of Heaven.\n\nWhile other characters in *Paradise Lost* are figures revered in Christianity, they do not fit the category of \"historical saints\" in the same manner. For instance:\n\n*   **Angelic Beings:** The archangels Michael and Gabriel are prominent characters. In some Christian traditions, Michael is referred to as \"Saint Michael,\" a title he was given in the late medieval period for his role as a protector against evil. However, within the context of the poem, Milton presents them as angelic beings and not as humans who lived and died before being canonized.\n*   **Biblical Figures:** Adam, Eve, and other Old Testament figures are central to the narrative but are not referred to by Milton with the title of \"saint.\" The poem does allude to the eventual coming of Jesus Christ, referred to as the Son of God, but this is a central divine figure rather than a historical saint in the traditional sense.\n\nMilton's own Puritan beliefs were critical of the veneration of saints as practiced by the Catholic Church, which may explain the scarcity of such references in his work. Some scholars suggest that his naming of fallen angels after pagan deities was a subtle critique of what he considered the idolatrous worship of saints.\n\nTherefore, despite a vast cast of divine and biblical characters, Saint Peter is the sole figure who is explicitly named as a historical saint in *Paradise Lost*.\n\n<<<1>>>"
