    "To ensure a symmetric key cannot be cracked by an arbitrarily powerful quantum computer, a key length of at least 256 bits is required. This is because quantum computers can theoretically use Grover's algorithm to significantly speed up the process of breaking symmetric encryption.\n\nGrover's algorithm provides a quadratic speedup on unstructured search problems, which includes brute-forcing a symmetric key. This effectively halves the security level of a key. For example, a 128-bit symmetric key, which would require approximately 2<sup>128</sup> operations to break with a classical computer, could be broken by a quantum computer in roughly 2<sup>64</sup> operations. A security level of 64 bits is considered insecure against modern computing capabilities, both classical and quantum.\n\nTo counteract the threat posed by Grover's algorithm, the key size for symmetric ciphers must be doubled to maintain a sufficient level of security. Therefore, to achieve a security level of 128 bits against a quantum attack, a symmetric key of 256 bits is necessary. An AES-256 key, for instance, would have its effective security reduced to 128 bits, a level that is still considered secure for the foreseeable future.\n\nOrganizations like the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) consider 256-bit symmetric keys, such as those used in AES-256, to be quantum-resistant.\n\n<<<A>>>"
