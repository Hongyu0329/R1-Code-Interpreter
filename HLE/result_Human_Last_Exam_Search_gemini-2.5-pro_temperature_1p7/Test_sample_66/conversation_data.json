    "The search results confirm my understanding of the Tongan flag's design. It consists of a red field with a white canton, and the canton contains a red \"couped cross.\" A couped cross is one that does not extend to the edges of the area it is in (in this case, the canton). This confirms my structural model of the matrix.\n\nThe logic seems solid. The rank of the matrix `M = a*R + b*W` is determined by the rank of `a*J + (b-a)*W`, where J is the matrix of all ones, and W is the matrix with ones for white pixels and zeros for red. We established that both J and W are rank-1 matrices. We also established that their column spaces are linearly independent.\n\nTherefore, for any choice of `a` and `b` such that `a ≠ b` and `a ≠ 0`, the resulting matrix `M` will be a linear combination of two linearly independent rank-1 matrices, which results in a rank-2 matrix.\n\nLet's consider the possible values for the rank:\n*   If we choose `a = b` (and `a ≠ 0`), the matrix is `a*J`, which has rank 1.\n*   If we choose `a = 0` and `b ≠ 0`, the matrix is `b*W`. Since `W` represents the white pixels (the canton minus the cross), its rank is 1. The total matrix rank is 1.\n*   If we choose `b = 0` and `a ≠ 0`, the matrix is `a*R = a*(J-W)`. Since `J` and `W` are linearly independent rank-1 matrices, their difference will be of rank 2.\n*   If we choose `a ≠ b` and `a ≠ 0, b ≠ 0`, the matrix `a*J + (b-a)*W` will have rank 2.\n*   If we choose `a=b=0`, the rank is 0.\n\nThe question asks for the *maximal possible rank*. Based on the analysis, the rank can be 0, 1, or 2. The maximum of these values is 2. The proportions of the flag and the cross, while affecting the specific vectors in the column space, do not change the fundamental fact that the matrix is composed of two basic, linearly independent patterns, leading to a rank of 2. Even though there's no official construction sheet for the flag, the general description is consistent and sufficient to determine the rank.\n\nFinal check of the reasoning:\n1. The matrix M can be written as `M = a*J + (b-a)*W`, where J is the all-ones matrix and W is a binary matrix for the white pixels.\n2. `rank(J) = 1`. The column space is spanned by `u = (1, 1, ..., 1)^T`.\n3. `W` is non-zero only in the top-left canton block. The white pixels in the canton form a rectangle with a cross-shaped hole. All non-zero rows of this sub-matrix are identical, meaning `rank(W_canton) = 1` and thus `rank(W) = 1`.\n4. The column space of W is spanned by a vector `v` which has ones in the rows corresponding to the white parts of the canton and zeros elsewhere.\n5. The vectors `u` and `v` are linearly independent.\n6. As long as `a ≠ 0` and `b-a ≠ 0` (i.e., `a ≠ b`), the matrix M is a sum of two linearly independent rank-1 matrices, and its rank is 2.\n7. This is the highest possible rank since `rank(A+B) <= rank(A) + rank(B) = 1 + 1 = 2`.\n\nThe maximal possible rank is 2.\n\nI am confident in my reasoning and conclusion.\n<<<2>>>"
