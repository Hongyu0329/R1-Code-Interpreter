    "The group $G$ is generated by the permutations $a$, $b$, and $c$.\n$a = (1, 3, 2, 5, 4, 7, 6, 9, 8, y, x)$\n$b = (1, 8, 5, 9)(4, x, 7, 6)$\n$c = (1, 2)(3, z)(4, 8)(5, 6)(7, y)(9, x)$\n\nThe group $G$ acts on the set $\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, x, y, z\\}$, which has 12 elements. The order of the Mathieu group $M_{12}$ is $95,040 = 2^6 \\cdot 3^3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 11$. The group $G$ is known to be the Mathieu group $M_{12}$. The generators provided are standard generators for $M_{12}$.\n\nThe Schur multiplier of $G = M_{12}$, denoted by $A$, is a cyclic group of order 2. This result was established by Burgoyne and Fong, correcting an earlier claim that the multiplier was trivial.\n\nThe Schur multiplier is $A \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2$. I need to count the number of proper subgroups of $A$, up to isomorphism.\n\nThe group $A = \\mathbb{Z}_2$ has only two subgroups: the trivial subgroup $\\{0\\}$ and the group itself $\\mathbb{Z}_2$. The proper subgroup is the trivial subgroup. Up to isomorphism, there is only one trivial group.\nTherefore, there is only 1 proper subgroup of $A$ up to isomorphism.\n\n<<<1>>>"
