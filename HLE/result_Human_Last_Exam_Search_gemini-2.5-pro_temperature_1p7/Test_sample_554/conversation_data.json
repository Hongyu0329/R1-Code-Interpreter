    "A hypothetical perfluoronanocar would contain 22 fluorine atoms. Here is a breakdown of how that number is determined:\n\n**1. Defining a \"Nanocar\"**\nA \"nanocar\" is not one specific molecule but rather a class of molecular machines designed to \"roll\" across a surface. A typical nanocar consists of two main parts: a molecular chassis and four fullerene (C60) \"wheels\". Since the fullerene wheels are composed entirely of carbon atoms, they do not have any hydrogen atoms to be replaced. Therefore, the process of perfluorination would only apply to the chassis.\n\n**2. The Nanocar Chassis**\nThe term \"perfluoro\" in chemistry indicates that all hydrogen atoms on a hydrocarbon structure have been replaced by fluorine atoms. To determine the number of fluorine atoms, one must first identify a representative chemical structure for a nanocar chassis and count its hydrogen atoms.\n\nA common and well-documented chassis structure, a variation of which was used in early nanocars, is based on 1,2,4,5-tetra(phenylethynyl)benzene. This structure consists of:\n*   **A central benzene ring:** This ring is substituted at four positions, leaving two hydrogen atoms.\n*   **Four \"axles\" made of phenylethynyl groups:** Each of these four groups (-C≡C-C₆H₅) contains a terminal phenyl ring (C₆H₅) which has five hydrogen atoms.\n\n**3. Calculating the Number of Fluorine Atoms**\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms on this representative chassis is calculated as follows:\n*   Hydrogens on the central ring: 2\n*   Hydrogens on the four terminal phenyl groups: 4 groups × 5 hydrogens/group = 20\n*   **Total Hydrogens:** 2 + 20 = 22\n\nIn a \"perfluoronanocar,\" each of these 22 hydrogen atoms would be replaced by a fluorine atom. Therefore, the molecule would contain 22 fluorine atoms.\n\n<<<22>>>"
