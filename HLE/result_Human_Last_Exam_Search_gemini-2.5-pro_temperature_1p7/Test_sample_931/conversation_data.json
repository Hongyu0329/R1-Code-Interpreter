    "Based on the search results, adult Raphidiopterans (snakeflies) have a diet that consists of both predation and, for some species, consuming pollen and nectar.\n\nSpecifically, the results indicate the following:\n*   **Predation on Aphids:** Multiple sources confirm that adult snakeflies are predators of soft-bodied insects, with aphids being a preferred and commonly cited prey. They are considered important predators of aphids in various ecosystems, including agricultural orchards.\n*   **Nectar and Pollen Consumption:** Several sources mention that some adult snakeflies are known to eat pollen. Some are also reported to feed on nectar and honeydew. It's noted that while pollen has been found in their guts, it's sometimes unclear if it's a required food source or just supplemental.\n\nTherefore, Raphidiopterans have been recorded feeding on both nectar (A) and aphids (E). Options B (Māhoe pollen), D (Karamū leaf tissue), and E (Totara Aphids) are very specific. While adults eat pollen and aphids, there's no specific mention of Māhoe pollen or Totara aphids in the search results. However, \"aphids\" is a general category that would include Totara Aphids. There is no evidence they consume leaf tissue.\n\nBased on the general diet described, both nectar and aphids are consumed by adults.\n\n<<<F>>>"
