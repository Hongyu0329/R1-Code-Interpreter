    "The formula for the fermionic partition function Z in the imaginary time representation using Feynman's path integral formalism is given by an integral over anticommuting Grassmann fields. This formalism is essential to correctly incorporate the Pauli exclusion principle for fermions.\n\nThe partition function Z is defined as the trace of the thermal density matrix, Z = Tr(e⁻βᴴ), where β is the inverse temperature (β = 1/k_B T) and H is the Hamiltonian of the system. In the path integral formalism, this trace is expressed as a functional integral over all possible field configurations in imaginary time.\n\nThe general formula is:\n```\nZ = ∫ Dψ̄ Dψ * e^(-S_E[ψ̄, ψ])\n```\nwhere:\n\n*   **ψ(x, τ)** and **ψ̄(x, τ)** are the fermionic fields, which are functions of spatial coordinates **x** and imaginary time **τ**. Crucially, these are not ordinary number-valued functions but are instead valued in a Grassmann algebra, meaning they are anticommuting numbers. This property is a mathematical representation of the fermionic nature of the particles. For instance, ψ_α(x)ψ_β(y) = -ψ_β(y)ψ_α(x).\n\n*   **Dψ̄ Dψ** represents the functional integration measure over all possible configurations of the Grassmann fields ψ̄ and ψ.\n\n*   **S_E[ψ̄, ψ]** is the Euclidean action of the system. It is obtained from the standard action in Minkowski spacetime by a Wick rotation, which involves the substitution of real time *t* with imaginary time τ (*t* → -iτ). The integral for the action is performed over imaginary time from 0 to β. A common form for a non-relativistic fermionic system is:\n\n    S_E = ∫₀^β dτ ∫ d³x  ψ̄(x, τ) (ħ∂/∂τ + H) ψ(x, τ)\n\n    Here, H is the single-particle Hamiltonian operator, which might include kinetic terms like (-ħ²/2m)∇² and potential terms.\n\nA defining feature of the fermionic partition function in the imaginary time formalism is the use of **anti-periodic boundary conditions** for the fermionic fields in the imaginary time direction. This means the fields must satisfy:\n```\nψ(x, τ + β) = -ψ(x, τ)\nψ̄(x, τ + β) = -ψ̄(x, τ)\n```\nThese boundary conditions are essential and arise from the trace operation in the definition of the partition function for fermions. They ensure that the formalism correctly reproduces the Fermi-Dirac statistics that govern fermionic systems. This is a key distinction from bosonic path integrals, which use periodic boundary conditions.\n\nFor non-interacting (free) fermions, the action is a quadratic form in the fields, which allows the Gaussian integral to be performed exactly. The result is the determinant of the operator in the action:\n```\nZ_free = det(ħ∂/∂τ + H)\n```\n\n<<<In the imaginary time representation using Feynman's path integral formalism, the fermionic partition function Z is given by:\n\nZ = ∫ Dψ̄ Dψ * e^(-S_E[ψ̄, ψ])\n\nHere, the integral is a functional integral over all possible configurations of the anticommuting Grassmann fields ψ(x, τ) and ψ̄(x, τ). The integration is performed subject to anti-periodic boundary conditions in the imaginary time variable τ, such that ψ(x, τ + β) = -ψ(x, τ), where β is the inverse temperature. The term S_E is the Euclidean action of the fermionic system, obtained from the Minkowskian action by the analytic continuation to imaginary time (t → -iτ).>>>"
