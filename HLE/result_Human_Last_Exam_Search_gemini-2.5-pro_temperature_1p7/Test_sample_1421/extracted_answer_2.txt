In the imaginary time representation using Feynman's path integral formalism, the fermionic partition function Z is given by:

Z = ∫ Dψ̄ Dψ * e^(-S_E[ψ̄, ψ])

Here, the integral is a functional integral over all possible configurations of the anticommuting Grassmann fields ψ(x, τ) and ψ̄(x, τ). The integration is performed subject to anti-periodic boundary conditions in the imaginary time variable τ, such that ψ(x, τ + β) = -ψ(x, τ), where β is the inverse temperature. The term S_E is the Euclidean action of the fermionic system, obtained from the Minkowskian action by the analytic continuation to imaginary time (t → -iτ).
