    "There are four wallpaper groups with a point group of order 2.\n\nThe symmetry of wallpaper groups can be described by their point group, which represents the rotations and reflections of the pattern. The order of a group is the number of elements it contains. For a wallpaper group to have a point group of order 2, the point group must be either the cyclic group C₂ or the dihedral group D₁.\n\nThe wallpaper groups that meet this condition are:\n*   **p2**: This group has a point group of C₂. Its patterns have 180° rotational symmetry (an order-2 rotation) but no reflections.\n*   **pm**: This group has a point group of D₁. Its patterns feature reflection symmetry across parallel axes but no rotational symmetry.\n*   **pg**: This group's point group is also D₁. Instead of reflections, its patterns are characterized by glide reflections, where a reflection is followed by a translation parallel to the axis of reflection. It does not have rotational symmetry.\n*   **cm**: This group also has a point group of D₁. It contains both reflections and glide reflections.\n\nThe groups p2, pm, pg, and cm are the only wallpaper groups whose point groups have an order of 2.\n\n<<<4>>>"
