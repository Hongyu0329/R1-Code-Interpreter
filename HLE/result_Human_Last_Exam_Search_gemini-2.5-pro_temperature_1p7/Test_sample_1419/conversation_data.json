    "In the ϕ⁴ theory near four dimensions, the leading order expression for the Wilson-Fisher fixed point coupling, denoted as u*, is derived using the epsilon expansion, where ϵ = 4 - d represents the deviation from four spatial dimensions.\n\nThe renormalization group (RG) beta function, which describes the running of the coupling constant `u` with the energy scale `μ`, is central to finding this fixed point. To the one-loop order, the beta function for a ϕ⁴ theory with a single scalar field (N=1) is given by:\n\nβ(u) = -ϵu + (3 / (16π²)) u²\n\nA fixed point of the RG flow occurs when the beta function is zero, meaning the coupling constant no longer changes with the energy scale. Setting the above equation to zero yields:\n\n-ϵu* + (3 / (16π²)) (u*)² = 0\n\nThis equation has two solutions. The first is the trivial Gaussian fixed point, u* = 0. The second, non-trivial solution is the Wilson-Fisher fixed point, which governs the critical behavior of the theory. Solving for this non-trivial fixed point gives:\n\nu* = (16π² / 3) ϵ\n\nThis expression represents the leading order contribution to the fixed point coupling in the ϵ expansion. It shows that for dimensions d < 4 (i.e., ϵ > 0), there exists a non-trivial fixed point at a small, positive value of the coupling, which is accessible via perturbation theory in ϵ.\n\n<<<u* = (16π² / 3) ϵ>>>"
