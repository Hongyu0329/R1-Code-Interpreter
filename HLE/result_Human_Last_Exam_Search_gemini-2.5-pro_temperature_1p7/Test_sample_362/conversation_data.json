    "### Product of the Wittig Reaction Identified\n\nThe reaction between pivalaldehyde and (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ⁵-phosphane, a classic example of a Wittig reaction, yields an alkene as the primary product along with triphenylphosphine oxide as a byproduct. The specific alkene formed is **(Z)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene**.\n\nThe Wittig reaction is a powerful method in organic synthesis for the formation of carbon-carbon double bonds from carbonyl compounds. The reaction mechanism involves the nucleophilic attack of the phosphorus ylide on the carbonyl carbon of the aldehyde or ketone. This leads to the formation of a four-membered ring intermediate called an oxaphosphetane, which subsequently decomposes to give the final alkene and triphenylphosphine oxide. The formation of the very stable phosphorus-oxygen double bond in triphenylphosphine oxide is a major driving force for this reaction.\n\nThe reactants in this specific case are:\n*   **Pivalaldehyde**, also known as 2,2-dimethylpropanal, which is a sterically hindered aldehyde due to the bulky tert-butyl group.\n*   **(2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ⁵-phosphane**, which is a phosphorus ylide. The substituent on the ylide carbon is a 2-chlorobenzyl group.\n\nThe stereochemical outcome of the Wittig reaction is largely dependent on the nature of the ylide. The ylide in this reaction, Ph₃P=CH-CH₂(2-chlorophenyl), is considered non-stabilized because the phenyl ring is not directly attached to the negatively charged carbon, meaning it cannot delocalize the charge through resonance. According to established principles, Wittig reactions involving non-stabilized ylides, under standard lithium-salt-free conditions, are under kinetic control and predominantly form the (Z)-alkene. This preference arises from a lower energy transition state leading to the *syn* betaine-like structure, which then proceeds to form the Z-alkene. While the significant steric hindrance of pivalaldehyde could potentially influence the reaction rate and yield, the general rule of Z-selectivity for non-stabilized ylides is expected to be the determining factor for the major stereoisomer formed.\n\nTherefore, the oxygen atom of pivalaldehyde is replaced by the substituted ethylidene group from the Wittig reagent, leading to the formation of the (Z)-isomer of 1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene.\n\n<<< (Z)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene"
