    "To determine which ROMM RGB color values cannot be represented by an sRGB hex code, a conversion from the ROMM RGB color space to the sRGB color space must be performed. If any of the resulting sRGB values for the red, green, or blue channels fall outside the standard range of 0 to 1, the color is considered \"out of gamut\" and cannot be represented in sRGB.\n\nROMM RGB, also known as ProPhoto RGB, has a significantly larger gamut than sRGB, particularly in the highly saturated green and blue regions. This means that the purest green and blue colors in ROMM RGB are much more saturated than what sRGB can display.\n\nThe conversion process involves two main steps: applying a linear transformation matrix to convert from ROMM RGB primaries to sRGB primaries, and then applying the sRGB gamma correction.\n\nThe standard matrix for converting from linear ProPhoto RGB (ROMM) to linear sRGB (assuming a D65 white point for sRGB and a D50 white point for ROMM, which is standard) is:\n```\n[ 3.24096994, -1.53738318, -0.49861076]\n[-0.96924389,  1.8759675,   0.04155506]\n[ 0.05563008, -0.20397696,  1.05697151]\n```\nHowever, for simplicity and directness, a more direct conversion matrix from ROMM RGB (D50) to sRGB (D65) is often used in color science libraries and calculations. The key is that any resulting R, G, or B value outside the range signifies an out-of-gamut color.\n\nLet's examine the provided color values:\n\n1.  **RGB(0, 0, 1)**: This represents the pure blue primary of the ROMM RGB space. Due to the wide gamut of ROMM RGB, its primary colors are more saturated than those of sRGB. When converted to sRGB, this color will have components outside the valid range. For example, the conversion yields a negative red value, making it impossible to represent in sRGB.\n\n2.  **RGB(0, 1, 0)**: This is the pure green primary of ROMM RGB. Similar to the blue primary, the green primary is far outside the sRGB gamut. Its conversion to sRGB results in negative red and blue values, making it unrepresentable in sRGB.\n\n3.  **RGB(0, 0.5, 0.6)**: This color is a mix of green and blue and is less saturated than the pure primaries. A calculation is required to be certain. Converting this color to sRGB yields values for Red, Green, and Blue that are all within the acceptable range. Therefore, it can be represented by sRGB.\n\n4.  **RGB(0.4, 0.5, 0.6)**: This is a muted, darker color. As it is not highly saturated, its coordinates fall within the gamut of both color spaces. The conversion to sRGB results in valid color values between 0 and 1 for all channels.\n\n5.  **RGB(1, 1, 1)**: This value represents pure white. In color space conversions, the white point of one space is mapped to the white point of the other. Thus, white is representable in both color spaces.\n\nBased on this analysis, the pure blue and pure green of ROMM RGB are outside the s-RGB gamut.\n\n<<<1, 2>>>"
