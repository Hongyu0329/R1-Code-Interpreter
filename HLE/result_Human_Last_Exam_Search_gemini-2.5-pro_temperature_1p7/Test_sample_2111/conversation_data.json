    "Fernand Braudel, in his emphasis on a global historical perspective, referred to **the identity of France** as the conceptual entity that, in the words of Paul Morand, should be \"inscribed within a sphere.\"\n\nIn his book, *L'Identité de la France* (The Identity of France), Braudel utilizes geological metaphors to articulate his concept of the nation's identity. He describes it as being composed of \"successive layers\" and \"powerful strata\" formed from \"marine sediments\". This creates a vision of France's identity as a \"residue\" or an \"amalgam\" shaped by deep historical processes over the *longue durée*. This complex, layered, and self-contained historical formation of national identity is what is metaphorically represented as being \"inscribed within a sphere.\" While the direct quote from Paul Morand remains elusive in the search, Braudel's work clearly points to the identity of a nation, specifically France, as the entity he is describing with this metaphorical language.\n\n<<<the identity of France>>>"
