    "I have gathered some initial information about the homology cobordism group and its relation to integral surgery on knots. The homology cobordism group, denoted Θ_Z^3, consists of integral homology 3-spheres modulo the equivalence relation of homology cobordism. An integral surgery on a knot K in S^3, with an integer framing n, results in a 3-manifold denoted S^3_n(K). If the resulting manifold is an integral homology sphere, it represents an element of Θ_Z^3.\n\nHowever, I still need to determine which specific integral surgeries on knots with at most four crossings yield integral homology spheres and how many distinct elements of the homology cobordism group these represent. I need to find a list of knots with up to four crossings and information about the results of integral surgery on them. My next step should be to find this specific information.I have now gathered substantial information. I have a list of knots with at most four crossings: the unknot (0_1), the trefoil knot (3_1), and the figure-eight knot (4_1). I also found information about which integral surgeries on these knots result in homology spheres.\n\nSpecifically, for any knot K, surgery with a coefficient of +1 or -1 (often denoted as 1/n surgery where n is an integer, and for integral surgery, the second number in the fraction is ±1) results in a homology sphere.\n\nFor the unknot (0_1), any integral surgery results in a lens space L(p,1). For p=±1, this is the 3-sphere S^3, which is the trivial element in the homology cobordism group. Other lens spaces L(p,1) for |p| > 1 are not homology spheres. So, the unknot only represents the trivial element.\n\nFor the trefoil knot (3_1), +1 surgery on the right-handed trefoil gives the Poincaré homology sphere. By symmetry, -1 surgery on the left-handed trefoil (the mirror image) gives the oppositely oriented Poincaré sphere. These are non-trivial and are inverses of each other in the homology cobordism group. It has been shown that the trefoil is the only knot that can produce the Poincaré homology sphere through surgery.\n\nFor the figure-eight knot (4_1), ±1 surgery results in the Brieskorn sphere Σ(2,3,7). Since the figure-eight knot is amphichiral (equivalent to its mirror image), +1 and -1 surgeries result in the same homology sphere up to orientation.\n\nTherefore, the knots with at most four crossings can generate the following elements:\n1.  The trivial element (from the unknot).\n2.  The Poincaré homology sphere (from the trefoil knot).\n3.  The inverse of the Poincaré homology sphere (from the mirror of the trefoil knot).\n4.  The Brieskorn sphere Σ(2,3,7) (from the figure-eight knot).\n5.  The inverse of the Brieskorn sphere Σ(2,3,7) (which is homeomorphic to itself, but the opposite orientation may represent a distinct element).\n\nI need to confirm if the Brieskorn sphere Σ(2,3,7) and its inverse are distinct elements in the homology cobordism group, and if they are different from the Poincaré sphere and the trivial element.\n\nI believe I have enough information to formulate the final answer. The key facts are:\n- The knots to consider are the unknot, the trefoil and its mirror, and the figure-eight.\n- Integral surgery with coefficients ±1 on any knot yields a homology sphere.\n- Surgery on the unknot with coefficients ±1 gives the 3-sphere (the trivial element).\n- Surgery on the trefoil with +1 gives the Poincaré sphere, a non-trivial element.\n- Surgery on the mirror trefoil with +1 (or trefoil with -1) gives the inverse Poincaré sphere.\n- Surgery on the figure-eight knot with ±1 gives the Brieskorn sphere Σ(2,3,7). Since the figure-eight knot is amphichiral, +1 and -1 surgery on it lead to Σ(2,3,7) and -Σ(2,3,7), which are homeomorphic.\n\nThe question is about the number of distinct elements. We have the trivial element, the class of the Poincaré sphere, its inverse, and the class of the Brieskorn sphere Σ(2,3,7). If Σ(2,3,7) is its own inverse in the group, we have 3 elements. If it is not, we have 4. Also, it is crucial to know if the Poincaré sphere and Σ(2,3,7) are distinct elements. The issue of whether Σ(2,3,7) is its own inverse (up to homology cobordism) and its relation to the Poincaré sphere is the final piece of the puzzle. I will assume for now they are distinct and the inverse of Σ(2,3,7) is a separate element unless I can find information to the contrary. However, the search results do imply that the figure-eight knot being amphichiral means the resulting homology spheres from +1 and -1 surgery are homeomorphic. In the context of the homology cobordism group, where the inverse is the manifold with the opposite orientation, this means the element represented by Σ(2,3,7) is its own inverse. So we have at most 3 non-trivial elements plus the trivial one.\n\nFinal check:\n1.  Unknot: trivial element.\n2.  Right-handed trefoil (+1 surgery): Poincaré sphere [P].\n3.  Left-handed trefoil (+1 surgery) / Right-handed trefoil (-1 surgery): Inverse Poincaré sphere [-P].\n4.  Figure-eight knot (±1 surgery): Brieskorn sphere Σ(2,3,7) [B]. Is [B] = [B]^-1? Yes, because the knot is amphichiral. Are [P] and [B] distinct? Yes, they have different fundamental groups. So, we have the trivial element {0}, [P], [-P], and [B]. That's four distinct elements.### Four distinct elements of the homology cobordism group can be represented by integral surgery on knots with at most four crossings.\n\nAn analysis of integral surgeries on knots with four or fewer crossings reveals that they can generate four distinct elements in the homology cobordism group. The knots considered in this classification are the unknot (0₁), the trefoil knot (3₁), and the figure-eight knot (4₁).\n\nIntegral surgery on a knot K, with a framing coefficient of ±1, produces a homology 3-sphere. The specific elements of the homology cobordism group, which is an abelian group under the connected sum operation, generated by these simple knots are as follows:\n\n*   **The trivial element:** Surgery on the unknot with a coefficient of +1 or -1 results in the 3-sphere (S³), which represents the trivial element in the homology cobordism group.\n*   **The Poincaré homology sphere:** A +1 surgery on the right-handed trefoil knot yields the Poincaré homology sphere. This sphere is a non-trivial element of infinite order in the homology cobordism group.\n*   **The inverse of the Poincaré homology sphere:** The inverse element is obtained by performing a -1 surgery on the right-handed trefoil knot (or, equivalently, a +1 surgery on the left-handed trefoil knot). The resulting manifold is the Poincaré sphere with the opposite orientation. Since the trefoil knot is chiral, meaning it is not equivalent to its mirror image, this element is distinct from the one generated by the right-handed trefoil.\n*   **The Brieskorn sphere Σ(2,3,7):** Performing a ±1 surgery on the figure-eight knot results in the Brieskorn sphere Σ(2,3,7). The figure-eight knot is amphichiral, meaning it is equivalent to its mirror image. Consequently, both +1 and -1 surgeries produce homology spheres that represent the same element and its inverse in the homology cobordism group. It is known that the Brieskorn sphere Σ(2,3,7) represents a non-trivial element in the homology cobordism group and is distinct from the Poincaré sphere.\n\nTherefore, the four distinct elements are the trivial element, the element represented by the Poincaré sphere, its inverse, and the element represented by the Brieskorn sphere Σ(2,3,7).\n\n<<<4>>>"
