    "There is no known mushroom genus that produces a distinctly blue spore print.\n\nWhile several species of mushrooms have a blue coloration on their caps or stems, their spore prints are of different colors. For example:\n*   **Lactarius indigo**, also known as the blue milk cap, is a vibrant blue mushroom, but its spore print is yellowish-cream.\n*   **Stropharia caerulea**, or the blue roundhead, has a blue-green cap, but its spore print is purple-brown to purple-black.\n*   **Cortinarius rotundisporus**, commonly called the elegant blue webcap, has a steely blue cap and a reddish-brown spore print.\n*   The **Blue Oyster mushroom** (*Pleurotus ostreatus var. columbinus*) is named for its blue cap, but its spore print is not blue.\n*   ***Entoloma hochstetteri***, a striking all-blue mushroom native to New Zealand, has a reddish-pink spore print.\n\nMushroom spore prints are typically shades of white, cream, pink, yellow, brown, purple-brown, or black. Green is a known, but uncommon, spore print color, yet blue is not a recognized color for mushroom spore prints in mycology.\n\n<<<There is no known mushroom genus that produces a distinctly blue spore print.>>>"
