    "To find the greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of the polynomial matrices:\nP1 = [[s^2 + s, -s], [-s^2 - 1, s^2]]\nP2 = [[s, 0], [-s - 1, 1]]\n\nWe can use the Euclidean algorithm for polynomial matrices, which involves performing elementary row operations on the compound matrix P formed by stacking P1 and P2. The goal is to reduce this matrix to its row-echelon form. The resulting non-zero rows will form the GCRD.\n\nThe compound matrix P is:\nP =\n[ s^2 + s,  -s   ]  (R1)\n[ -s^2 - 1, s^2  ]  (R2)\n[ s,        0    ]  (R3)\n[ -s - 1,   1    ]  (R4)\n\nWe perform row operations with polynomial coefficients to simplify the matrix.\n\n1.  We can express R1 as a multiple of R4. Notice that -s * R4 = -s * [-s - 1, 1] = [s^2 + s, -s], which is exactly R1.\n    Therefore, we can perform the operation R1 ← R1 + s*R4:\n    [ (s^2 + s) + s(-s-1), -s + s*1 ] = [ s^2 + s - s^2 - s, -s + s ] = [ 0, 0 ]\n\n    The matrix becomes:\n    [ 0,        0    ]\n    [ -s^2 - 1, s^2  ]  (R2)\n    [ s,        0    ]  (R3)\n    [ -s - 1,   1    ]  (R4)\n\n    The row of zeros can be ignored, and the GCRD will be the GCRD of the remaining rows.\n\n2.  Let's use R4 to eliminate the s^2 term in the second column of R2. We perform R2 ← R2 - s^2*R4:\n    [ -s^2 - 1 - s^2(-s-1), s^2 - s^2*1 ] = [ -s^2 - 1 + s^3 + s^2, 0 ] = [ s^3 - 1, 0 ]\n\n    The set of rows generating the module is now:\n    [ s^3 - 1,  0    ]  (R2')\n    [ s,        0    ]  (R3)\n    [ -s - 1,   1    ]  (R4)\n\n3.  Now, we focus on the first two rows. We can find the greatest common divisor of the scalar polynomials s^3 - 1 and s using the Euclidean algorithm for polynomials.\n    s^3 - 1 = s^2 * s - 1\n    This implies 1 = s^2 * s - (s^3 - 1).\n    We can perform the corresponding row operation: R2' ← s^2*R3 - R2':\n    [ s^2*s - (s^3 - 1), s^2*0 - 0 ] = [ s^3 - s^3 + 1, 0 ] = [ 1, 0 ]\n\n    The set of rows is now equivalent to:\n    [ 1,        0    ]  (R2'')\n    [ s,        0    ]  (R3)\n    [ -s - 1,   1    ]  (R4)\n\n4.  R3 can be expressed as s * R2''. We can eliminate R3 by the operation R3 ← R3 - s*R2'':\n    [ s - s*1, 0 - s*0 ] = [ 0, 0 ]\n\n    This leaves us with:\n    [ 1,        0    ]  (R2'')\n    [ -s - 1,   1    ]  (R4)\n\n5.  Finally, we can simplify this further. We perform the operation R4 ← R4 + (s+1)*R2'':\n    [ -s - 1 + (s+1)*1, 1 + (s+1)*0 ] = [ 0, 1 ]\n\n    The resulting basis for the row module is:\n    G =\n    [ 1, 0 ]\n    [ 0, 1 ]\n\nThis is the identity matrix, I. A GCRD is not unique; it is defined up to a pre-multiplication by a unimodular matrix (a polynomial matrix with a constant non-zero determinant). Since the identity matrix is unimodular, this means that P1 and P2 are right coprime.\n\nWe can verify that I is a common right divisor:\nP1 = P1 * I\nP2 = P2 * I\nThis is trivially true.\n\nLet D be any other common right divisor. Then P1 = A1*D and P2 = A2*D for some polynomial matrices A1 and A2. Through the row reduction process, we have shown that there exist polynomial matrices L1 and L2 such that I = L1*P1 + L2*P2. Substituting the expressions for P1 and P2, we get I = (L1*A1 + L2*A2)*D. This shows that I is a left multiple of any other common right divisor D. Thus, the identity matrix is a greatest common right divisor.\n\n<<<[,]>>>"
