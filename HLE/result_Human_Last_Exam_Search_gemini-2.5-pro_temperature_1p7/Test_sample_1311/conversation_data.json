    "The binding affinity of 7-dimethylphosphoryl-3-[2-[[(3~{S})-6,6-dimethylpiperidin-3-yl]amino]-5-(trifluoromethyl)pyrimidin-4-yl]-1~{H}-indole-6-carbonitrile, also known as Samuraciclib (CT7001) or SY-5609, to Cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7) has been determined. This compound is a potent and selective inhibitor of CDK7.\n\nThe half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50), a common measure of binding affinity, for Samuraciclib (CT7001) against CDK7 is reported to be 41 nM. Another source states the IC50 value is 40 nM. Both of these values fall within the 0.1 nM to 100 nM range.\n\n<<<B>>>"
