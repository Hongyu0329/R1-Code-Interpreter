The appropriate management for this patient involves a phased approach: first, emergency dental care and immediate referral for systemic management of her uncontrolled diabetes; second, after achieving stable glycemic control, the fabrication of a cast metal framework removable partial denture utilizing abutment teeth on both sides of the arch for stability. The cells of primary interest are those involved in wound healing (platelets, macrophages, fibroblasts, osteoblasts), as their function is significantly compromised by her diabetic state.
