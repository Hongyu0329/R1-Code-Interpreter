    "There are varying classifications for the stable reduction of curves of genus 2, with the number of types depending on whether the curve's Weierstrass points are considered \"marked\" and the residue characteristic of the field. The most detailed and recent classification identifies 54 types.\n\nA 2025 paper by Tim Gehrunger provides a classification for the stable marked reduction of genus 2 curves in residue characteristic 2. This work, which considers the curve marked with its 6 Weierstrass points, identifies **54 different combinatorial structures**. These 54 types are categorized into broader classes denoted by letters (A through G), which are further subdivided. For instance, the classification includes 3 subcases for smooth reduction (Type A), 11 for reduction with one even double point (Type B), 6 for two even double points (Type C), and 24 for three even double points (Type D). This classification has been implemented in the SageMath computer algebra system. An application of this implementation to a dataset of genus 2 curves found that 53 of the 54 types are realized over the rational numbers, leading to the conjecture that all 54 are indeed possible over this field.\n\nAn earlier classification by Qing Liu from 1993, which appears to be for unmarked curves, identifies **42 stable reduction types**. Another source by Liu and Henri Cohen describes several types of stable reduction for genus 2 curves using Roman numerals:\n*   **(I)** The stable reduction is a smooth curve.\n*   **(II)** The stable reduction is an elliptic curve with an ordinary double point.\n*   **(III)** The stable reduction consists of a projective line with two ordinary double points.\n*   **(IV)** The stable reduction is formed by two projective lines that cross at three points.\n*   **(V)** The stable reduction is the union of two elliptic curves intersecting at a single point.\n*   **(VI)** The stable reduction is the union of an elliptic curve and a projective line with one ordinary double point, with the two components intersecting at one point.\n*   **(VII)** Similar to type VI, but both components are singular.\n\n<<<54>>>"
