    "The initial search has provided some foundational information. I now understand that a reductive group of type $E_8$ over a finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$, denoted as $E_8(q)$, is a finite simple group of Lie type. The maximal tori in such a group are subgroups that are conjugate to the group of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational points of a maximal torus defined over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ in the corresponding algebraic group.\n\nThe search results indicate that the number of conjugacy classes of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori is related to the conjugacy classes of the Weyl group of $E_8$. Specifically, the classes of F-stable maximal tori are parameterized by the F-conjugacy classes of the Weyl group $W(E_8)$. For a split group $G$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$, the Frobenius map $F$ acts trivially on the Weyl group, so the $F$-conjugacy classes are just the ordinary conjugacy classes of $W(E_8)$.\n\nThe Weyl group of $E_8$ is a finite group of order 696,729,600. The number of its conjugacy classes is known to be 112.\n\nTherefore, for the split group of type $E_8$, the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori should be equal to the number of conjugacy classes of its Weyl group. The initial search also confirms that for a finite field, any group of type $E_8$ is split. This simplifies the problem significantly.\n\nI need to confirm this understanding and find a direct statement that the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori in a split reductive group is equal to the number of conjugacy classes of its Weyl group. Then, I need to find the number of conjugacy classes of the Weyl group of type $E_8$. I believe I have a strong lead on this number being 112.I have confirmed from multiple sources that for a split reductive group over a finite field, the F-conjugacy classes of the Weyl group are simply the ordinary conjugacy classes. The number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori is in bijection with these conjugacy classes.\n\nFor the group of type $E_8$, all forms over a finite field are split. Therefore, the problem reduces to finding the number of conjugacy classes of the Weyl group of $E_8$, denoted $W(E_8)$.\n\nI have found a reliable source stating that the number of conjugacy classes of the Weyl group of $E_8$ is 112. The same source also provides information on the number of elliptic conjugacy classes, which is 30.\n\nI am confident that I have sufficient information to answer the user's request.\nThe number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a reductive group $G$ of type $E_8$ over a finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is 112. This is because all groups of type $E_8$ over a finite field are split. For a split reductive group over $\\mathbb{F}_q$, the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori is equal to the number of conjugacy classes of its Weyl group. The Weyl group of $E_8$, denoted $W(E_8)$, has 112 conjugacy classes.\n\n<<<112>>>'The user wants to know the exact number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a reductive group of type $E_8$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$.\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Request:**\n    *   **Object:** Reductive group of type $E_8$.\n    *   **Field:** Finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$.\n    *   **Quantity to find:** The exact number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori.\n\n2.  **Initial Knowledge & Keywords:**\n    *   Reductive group, finite field, $E_8$, maximal torus, $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational, conjugacy classes, Weyl group.\n\n3.  **Formulate Search Strategy:**\n    *   **Step 1: Foundational Concepts.** I need to understand what an \"$E_8$ group over $\\mathbb{F}_q$\" is and what \"$\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori\" are. I also need to find the general theorem that connects the number of these tori to other, more computable invariants of the group.\n        *   `reductive group of type E8 over a finite field`\n        *   `F_q-rational maximal tori of a reductive group`\n        *   `number of maximal tori in E8 over finite fields`\n    *   **Step 2: Connecting Tori to Weyl Group.** The initial searches will likely point towards a connection with the Weyl group and its conjugacy classes, specifically \"F-conjugacy classes\".\n        *   `number of conjugacy classes of F-stable maximal tori in a split reductive group over a finite field`\n    *   **Step 3: Specifics for E8.** Now I need to focus on $E_8$. Is it always split over $\\mathbb{F}_q$? What is its Weyl group, $W(E_8)$? And most importantly, how many conjugacy classes does $W(E_8)$ have?\n        *   `Is E8 always split over a finite field?` (This might be answered by the first set of searches)\n        *   `Weyl group of E8`\n        *   `number of conjugacy classes of the Weyl group of E8`\n\n4.  **Execution of Search Strategy & Information Synthesis:**\n\n    *   **Step 1 (Execution):** The first set of searches (as performed in the thought process) reveals that:\n        *   $E_8(q)$ is a finite simple group of Lie type.\n        *   The number of conjugacy classes of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori is parameterized by the \"$F$-conjugacy classes\" of the Weyl group.\n        *   Crucially, over finite fields, any algebraic group of type $E_8$ is *split*. This is a major simplification.\n\n    *   **Step 2 (Execution):** For a *split* group over $\\mathbb{F}_q$, the Frobenius endomorphism $F$ acts trivially on the Weyl group. This means that the \"$F$-conjugacy classes\" are just the ordinary conjugacy classes of the Weyl group. So, the problem has been reduced from a potentially complicated Galois cohomology calculation to a question about finite group theory: counting the conjugacy classes of $W(E_8)$.\n\n    *   **Step 3 (Execution):**\n        *   The fact that $E_8$ is split over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is confirmed.\n        *   The Weyl group $W(E_8)$ is a well-studied finite group of order 696,729,600.\n        *   The search for the number of conjugacy classes yields a direct answer. A paper by Carter (referenced in a presentation slide) determined the conjugacy classes of $W(E_8)$. The number is 112. The presentation slide explicitly states: `â™¯cl(W) = 112`.\n\n5.  **Final Answer Formulation:**\n\n    *   Start with the direct answer.\n    *   Provide a clear and concise explanation, building the logical chain.\n    *   **Premise 1:** The number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori in a reductive group G over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is given by the number of $F$-conjugacy classes of its Weyl group $W$.\n    *   **Premise 2:** For any group of type $E_8$ over a finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$, the group is *split*.\n    *   **Premise 3:** For a *split* group, the Frobenius map acts trivially on the Weyl group, so the $F$-conjugacy classes are just the ordinary conjugacy classes of $W$.\n    *   **Conclusion 1:** Therefore, the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori is equal to the number of conjugacy classes of the Weyl group of $E_8$, denoted $W(E_8)$.\n    *   **Factual Data:** The number of conjugacy classes of $W(E_8)$ is known to be 112.\n    *   **Final Statement:** Combine these points into a smooth paragraph and add the citation. Conclude with the required `<<<answer>>>` format.\n\nThis systematic process ensures all parts of the question are addressed, the reasoning is sound and verifiable through the provided search results, and the final answer is presented clearly and in the requested format.The exact number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a reductive group $G$ of type $E_8$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is 112.\n\nA fundamental result in the theory of reductive algebraic groups over finite fields states that the $\\mathbb{F}_q$-conjugacy classes of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori are in one-to-one correspondence with the $F$-conjugacy classes of the Weyl group $W$, where $F$ is the Frobenius endomorphism. For a group of type $E_8$ over a finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$, the group is always of the split form. In the case of a split group, the Frobenius endomorphism acts trivially on the Weyl group, which means the $F$-conjugacy classes are simply the ordinary conjugacy classes of the Weyl group.\n\nTherefore, the problem is reduced to finding the number of conjugacy classes of the Weyl group of type $E_8$, denoted $W(E_8)$. The structure of this Weyl group is well-understood, and the number of its conjugacy classes has been calculated to be 112.\n\n<<<112>>>"
