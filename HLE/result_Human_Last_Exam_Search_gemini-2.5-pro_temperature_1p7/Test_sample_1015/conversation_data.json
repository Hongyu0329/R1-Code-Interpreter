    "A key distinction between a cambré derrière in the Vaganova and Balanchine methods lies in the placement of the hip. While both methods emphasize a bend from the upper back, the approach to hip alignment differs, reflecting the broader stylistic principles of each technique.\n\nIn the **Vaganova method**, there is a strong emphasis on maintaining a square and stable torso. This principle extends to the cambré derrière, where the goal is to keep the hips squarely aligned forward as the upper and middle back extend. The movement is controlled and expressive, with a focus on the flexibility of the spine and the coordinated, graceful carriage of the arms (port de bras) and head. The Vaganova style is noted for its attention to the harmonious use of the entire body, with the backbend initiated from the upper spine while the lower body remains firmly placed.\n\nConversely, the **Balanchine method** is renowned for its speed, athleticism, and the creation of long, dynamic lines. A hallmark of the Balanchine style is a more open arabesque, where the hip of the working leg is allowed to lift and open towards the audience. This principle influences the cambré derrière, resulting in a deeper and more dramatic backbend that often involves a less squared alignment of the hips to achieve a greater range of motion and a more \"neoclassical\" aesthetic. This method often features unique port de bras and a specific head placement, famously known as the \"Balanchine head,\" to complement the dynamic lines of the body.\n\nWhile other elements such as arm placement, speed, the degree of the backbend, and head placement do differ between the two methods, the fundamental difference in the approach to hip alignment during a backward bend is a significant distinguishing factor.\n\n<<<B>>>"
