    "In the world of ballroom dancing, with its precise techniques and intricate footwork, certain movements are strictly defined to maintain the character and integrity of each dance. The question of whether a reverse turn can be overturned without violating technical principles reveals a key distinction among the various standard dances. After a thorough review of the technical aspects of each dance, the answer becomes clear.\n\nIn the **Slow Foxtrot**, it is impossible to overturn a reverse turn without disregarding the technique, primarily due to the critical role of the lady's heel turn. The heel turn is a defining characteristic of the Slow Foxtrot, and its correct execution is paramount. For the lady to perform the heel turn correctly, she must complete the turn without it being overturned. If the man overturns his part of the figure, he will inevitably pull or push the lady off balance during her heel turn, which is a significant technical error. This action disrupts the smooth, continuous, and gliding quality that is the essence of the Slow Foxtrot. One technical manual explicitly notes that the lady's ability to step forward correctly after her heel turn is only possible if she has \"completed the turn - not overturned\".\n\nBy contrast, in the **Viennese Waltz**, while overturning a reverse turn, especially to navigate a corner, is considered extremely difficult and generally avoided in favor of under-turning a natural turn, it is not described as technically impossible in the same definitive manner as in the Slow Foxtrot. The challenge in the Viennese Waltz lies in maintaining balance and control at a high speed.\n\nIn the other dances listed:\n*   **English Waltz:** While control is crucial, and overturning is generally a fault, there isn't a specific, defining technical element like the Slow Foxtrot's heel turn that is inherently broken by the act of overturning a standard reverse turn.\n*   **European Tango:** The Tango's character is staccato and has no swing, and while turns are precise, the technical literature does not highlight the same absolute prohibition against overturning a reverse turn as in the Slow Foxtrot.\n*   **Quickstep:** Overturning can be a feature of certain figures, like an overturned progressive chasse leading into another figure, but a standard reverse turn is expected to be danced with the prescribed amount of turn to maintain control and rhythm.\n\nTherefore, the unique mechanics of the Slow Foxtrot's reverse turn, with the integral heel turn for the lady, make it the dance where overturning is technically impossible without a clear violation of its fundamental principles.\n\n<<<D>>>"
