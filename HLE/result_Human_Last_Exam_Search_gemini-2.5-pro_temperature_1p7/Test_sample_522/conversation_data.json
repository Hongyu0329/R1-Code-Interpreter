    "The initial search did not provide any specific information about this puzzle. The results are mostly from document archives that happen to contain the numerical strings. I need to re-evaluate my analysis of the puzzle's logic, as it seems my initial assumptions were incorrect.\n\nLet's break down the transformation again, looking for a simpler rule. The core of the puzzle seems to revolve around the movement or transformation of the digit '2'.\n\n**Re-analyzing Input_A to Output_A:**\n\n*   **Input Grid A:**\n    ```\n    0 0 1 1 1 1\n    1 2 1 1 1 1\n    1 1 1 1 1 1\n    ```\n*   **Output Grid A:**\n    ```\n    2 0 1 1 1 1\n    1 0 1 1 1 1\n    1 1 1 1 1 1\n    ```\n\n*   **Changes:**\n    *   The '2' at `Input_A[1][1]` is gone; `Output_A[1][1]` is '0'.\n    *   The '0' at `Input_A[0][0]` is gone; `Output_A[0][0]` is '2'.\n\nThis appears to be a swap. The '2' moves to the location of a '0', and its original location becomes a '0'. The question is, why that specific '0'? Let's consider the coordinates (row, column, 0-indexed):\n*   Position of '2': `(1, 1)`\n*   Position of the moved '2': `(0, 0)`\n\nThe '0' at `(0, 0)` is the first available '0' if we read the grid from left to right, top to bottom.\n\n**Re-analyzing Input_B to Output_B:**\n\n*   **Input Grid B:**\n    ```\n    0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n    1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0\n    1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0\n    1 1 1 1 0 0 2 1 1 1 1 1 1\n    1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n    ```\n*   **Output Grid B:**\n    ```\n    0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n    1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0\n    1 1 1 1 0 0 0 2 1 1 1 1 0\n    1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1\n    1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n    ```\n\n*   **Changes:**\n    *   The '2' at `Input_B[3][6]` is gone; `Output_B[3][6]` is now '0'. Wait, that's not what the output shows. Let me re-read the provided Output_B. It is `'0000000000000,1100000001000,1111000211110,1111000111111,1111111111111'`. The changes are:\n    *   The '2' from `Input_B[3][6]` has moved.\n    *   The '0' at `Input_B[2][7]` has been replaced by a '2' in `Output_B[2][7]`.\n    *   The original position of the '2' (`Input_B[3][6]`) has been replaced by '0'. However, the problem statement says `Output_B[3]` is `1111000111111`. This indicates `Input_B[3][6]` (the '2') becomes '0', and `Input_B[3][7]` (the '1') also becomes '1' in `Output_B`. This part is inconsistent.\n\nThere seems to be a misunderstanding of the transformation in `Input_B` to `Output_B`. Let's re-examine my hypothesis on `Output_A`.\n\nThe rule is: Find the '2'. Find the first '0' in the grid (reading left-to-right, top-to-bottom). Swap them. Let's re-verify with the given `Output_A`:\n*   In `Input_A`, the first '0' is at `(0,0)`. The '2' is at `(1,1)`.\n*   Swap them: The '2' moves to `(0,0)`, and a '0' moves to `(1,1)`.\n*   This results in:\n    ```\n    2 0 1 1 1 1\n    1 0 1 1 1 1\n    1 1 1 1 1 1\n    ```\n*   This matches `Output_A` perfectly.\n\nLet's assume this rule is correct and there might be a typo in the provided `Output_B`. Let's apply the rule to `Input_B`:\n*   **Input Grid B:** Find the '2' at `(3,6)`.\n*   Find the first '0' in the grid. This is at `(0,0)`.\n*   Swap them. The '2' moves to `(0,0)`, and the original position of the '2' at `(3,6)` becomes '0'.\n*   **Calculated Output_B:**\n    ```\n    2000000000000\n    1100000001000\n    1111000011110\n    1111000111111  // The '2' at index 6 is now '0'\n    1111111111111\n    ```\nThis calculated output is different from the provided `Output_B`, suggesting the rule might be more complex or my interpretation of the `Output_B` from the prompt is wrong.\n\nLet me reconsider the logic by trying to find a rule that correctly transforms `Input_B` into the provided `Output_B`.\n*   **Input `2` location:** `(3,6)`\n*   **Output `2` location:** `(2,7)`\n*   `Input[2][7]` was '0'. `Output[3][6]` is '0'. This looks like a move, not a swap. The '2' moves to an adjacent (diagonally up-right) '0' cell, and the original location of '2' becomes '0'.\n\nLet's check this \"move\" rule on `Input_A`.\n*   '2' is at `(1,1)`. Adjacent cells are: `(0,0)`, `(0,1)`, `(0,2)`, `(1,0)`, `(1,2)`, `(2,0)`, `(2,1)`, `(2,2)`.\n*   Are any of these '0'? Yes, `(0,0)` and `(0,1)`.\n*   The rule could be: the '2' moves to the *first* adjacent '0' when read top-to-bottom, left-to-right.\n    *   The adjacent cells of `(1,1)` are `(0,0)`, `(0,1)`, `(0,2)`, `(1,0)`, `(1,2)`, `(2,0)`, `(2,1)`, `(2,2)`.\n    *   The corresponding values are '0', '0', '1', '1', '1', '1', '1', '1'.\n    *   The first adjacent '0' is at `(0,0)`.\n    *   So, the '2' moves from `(1,1)` to `(0,0)`, and `(1,1)` becomes '0'. This results in `Output_A`. This rule works for the first example.\n\nNow let's apply this \"move to first adjacent 0\" rule to `Input_B`.\n*   '2' is at `(3,6)`.\n*   Adjacent cells: `(2,5), (2,6), (2,7), (3,5), (3,7), (4,5), (4,6), (4,7)`.\n*   Corresponding values from `Input_B`: `0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1`.\n*   The first adjacent '0' is at `(2,5)`.\n*   So, the '2' should move to `(2,5)` and `(3,6)` should become '0'.\n*   This would make `Output_B[2]` as `1111020011110` and `Output_B[3]` as `1111000111111`.\n*   This does *not* match the provided `Output_B`.\n\nLet's rethink. What if the '2' has a direction?\n\nLet's consider another possibility for the rule, this time focusing on what happens when a '2' has no adjacent '0's to move to.\n\n**Let's apply the logic to Input_C:**\n`Input_C='000000,011120,111111'`\n\nGrid C:\n```\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 1 1 1 2 0\n1 1 1 1 1 1\n```\n\nThe '2' is at `(1,4)`. Let's analyze its adjacent cells: `(0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (1,3), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5)`.\nThe values at these positions are: `0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1`.\nThere are four adjacent '0's. Based on the rule that seemed plausible for A (\"move to the first adjacent '0'\"), the '2' would move to `(0,3)`.\nIf this rule holds:\n*   The '2' moves from `(1,4)` to `(0,3)`.\n*   The original position `(1,4)` becomes '0'.\n*   `Output_C[0]` would become `000200`.\n*   `Output_C[1]` would become `011100`.\n*   `Output_C[2]` remains `111111`.\n\nSo the result would be `'000200,011100,111111'`.\n\nThere is no apparent reason from the first two examples why `Input_C` would result in 'MISSING'. This suggests there's a condition or a rule aspect that I have not yet uncovered, which is met in case C.\n\nPerhaps the '2' needs to be \"stable\" or \"unstable\".\n*   In A, the '2' is at `(1,1)`. It has '0's adjacent.\n*   In B, the '2' at `(3,6)` has '0's adjacent.\n*   In C, the '2' at `(1,4)` has '0's adjacent.\n\nWhat if \"MISSING\" means the puzzle has no valid move or enters a state that is invalid?\nIn all three cases, there are adjacent '0's.\n\nLet's reconsider the movement. What if the direction of movement is fixed? Example B is the most complex. The `2` moves from `(3,6)` to `(2,7)`. This is \"up and right\". Why?\nIn Example A, it moves from `(1,1)` to `(0,0)`. This is \"up and left\". There is no consistent direction.\n\nThe puzzle might be simpler. Let's look at the numbers of each digit.\n*   `Input_A`: Two '0's, one '2'. `Output_A`: Two '0's, one '2'.\n*   `Input_B`: A lot of '0's, one '2'. `Output_B`: Same number of '0's and one '2'.\n*   `Input_C`: Eight '0's, one '2'.\n\nIt's a positional transformation. The \"MISSING\" output is the key. Why would the transformation fail for C?\nLet's look at what is below the '2' in each case.\n*   A: Below `(1,1)` is `(2,1)` which has a '1'. The '2' is supported.\n*   B: Below `(3,6)` is `(4,6)` which has a '1'. The '2' is supported.\n*   C: Below `(1,4)` is `(2,4)` which has a '1'. The '2' is supported.\n\nThis \"gravity\" idea doesn't seem to lead anywhere.\n\nLet's go back to the most promising rule: \"The '2' moves to the first available adjacent '0' cell (reading order), and its original position becomes a '0'.\" This worked perfectly for A but not for the provided B. But what if the provided `Output_B` is erroneous, and this simple rule is indeed the key? Let's re-calculate all outputs with this rule.\n*   **A**: '2' at `(1,1)`, first adjacent '0' at `(0,0)`. -> `201111,101111,111111`. **Matches.**\n*   **B**: '2' at `(3,6)`, first adjacent '0' at `(2,5)`. -> `0000000000000,1100000001000,1111020011110,1111000111111,1111111111111`. **Does not match provided output.**\n*   **C**: '2' at `(1,4)`, first adjacent '0' at `(0,3)`. -> `000200,011100,111111`.\n\nWhy would C result in MISSING? Maybe the rule is that if the '2' has no '0's adjacent to it, it is \"missing\" a move. Let's check:\n*   `Input_C` '2' at `(1,4)` has four adjacent '0's. So this can't be it.\n\nLet me try to formulate a new hypothesis.\nWhat if '2' can only move into a '0' if that '0' is on a row above it?\n*   A: `2` at row 1. `0` at row 0. Move is valid.\n*   B: `2` at row 3. `0` at row 2. Move is valid.\n*   C: `2` at row 1. `0` at row 0. Move is valid.\n\nThis doesn't help explain \"MISSING\".\n\nLet's try one final perspective. The problem is a pattern recognition task. The provided `Output_B` is likely correct, and my derived rules are wrong.\nLet's find the relationship between the start and end positions.\n*   A: `(1,1)` -> `(0,0)`. Delta: `(-1, -1)`\n*   B: `(3,6)` -> `(2,7)`. Delta: `(-1, +1)`\n\nThe deltas are different. There is no simple vector.\n\nHowever, notice `Output_C` is specified as `MISSING`. This implies some condition in `Input_C` makes the transformation impossible. What is unique about `Input_C`?\n*   Grid A has shape 3x6.\n*   Grid B has shape 5x13.\n*   Grid C has shape 3x6.\n\nLet's look at the neighborhood of the `2` again.\n*   A at (1,1): `0 0 1`, `1 2 1`, `1 1 1`. The immediate 3x3 block around the 2 is `[[0,1,1],[2,1,1],[1,1,1]]` (reading from input grid `[[0,0,1],[1,2,1],[1,1,1]]`).\n*   B at (3,6): The immediate 3x3 block around the 2 is `[[0,0,1],[0,2,1],[1,1,1]]`.\n*   C at (1,4): The immediate 3x3 block around the 2 is `[[0,0,0],[1,2,0],[1,1,1]]`.\n\nIn case C, the `2` is surrounded by four `0`s. In A, it is surrounded by two `0`s. In B, it is surrounded by four `0`s.\nThe number of adjacent `0`s:\n*   A: 2\n*   B: 4\n*   C: 4\n\nMaybe the issue in C is the specific arrangement of the neighbors. Let's re-examine C's 3x3 block centered on the '2':\n`0 0 0`\n`1 2 0`\n`1 1 1`\n\nThe '2' is almost \"exposed\" on its top and right side.\nIn example A, the '2' moves up and left.\nIn example B, the '2' moves up and right.\nIt seems the '2' wants to move \"up\".\nWhy did it move left in A and right in B?\n*   A: `(1,1)` -> `(0,0)`. Neighbors above: `(0,0)='0'`, `(0,1)='0'`, `(0,2)='1'`. It moves to the first '0' it finds in the row above, scanning left-to-right. That's `(0,0)`.\n*   B: `(3,6)` -> `(2,7)`. Neighbors above: `(2,5)='0'`, `(2,6)='0'`, `(2,7)='0'`. Why does it move to `(2,7)` and not `(2,5)`? The given `Output_B` is the key. Perhaps it moves to the *last* available `0` in the row above? No, that would be inconsistent with A.\n\nLet's discard the provided `Output_B` as it seems to contradict the simpler rule from `Output_A`. Let's stick with the simplest rule that works for A: **The '2' is swapped with the first '0' found when reading the grid from top-to-bottom, left-to-right.**\n\nUnder this rule:\n*   A works.\n*   C becomes `'000200,011100,111111'`.\nThe problem states the answer for C is `MISSING`. This means my simple rule is incorrect.\n\nThere must be a condition that C fails.\nWhat if we consider the numbers as representing height in a 3D landscape?\n'0' is a valley. '1' is flat ground. '2' is a peak.\nIn A and B, the '2' moves to a different location. In C, it can't.\nWhat if the '2' needs to roll \"downhill\"? A '2' can only move to a '0'. But what determines the destination?\nIn A, the `2` moves from `(1,1)` to `(0,0)`. The sum of coordinates decreases (1+1=2, 0+0=0).\nIn B, the `2` moves from `(3,6)` to `(2,7)`. The sum of coordinates is the same (3+6=9, 2+7=9).\n\nLet's test this:\n*   Hypothesis: A '2' moves to an adjacent '0' cell. If there are multiple choices, it moves to the one where the sum of coordinates is minimized. If there's a tie, something else happens.\n    *   A: '2' at `(1,1)`. Adjacent '0's at `(0,0)` and `(0,1)`. Sums of coords: `0` and `1`. Minimum is `0`, so it moves to `(0,0)`. This works for A.\n    *   B: '2' at `(3,6)`. Adjacent '0's at `(2,5)`, `(2,6)`, `(2,7)`, `(3,5)`. Sums: `7, 8, 9, 8`. Minimum is `7`, so it should move to `(2,5)`. This contradicts the given `Output_B`.\n\nThis puzzle is more lateral than it seems. \"MISSING\" could be a wordplay.\nLet's analyze C again.\n`000000`\n`011120`\n`111111`\nWhat is \"missing\"? Maybe a digit. A '3'? No.\nThe configuration `1112` looks like part of a sequence. The row `011120` contains a `1112` subsequence.\nIs there any significance to the `121` in `Input_A` or the `021` in `Input_B`?\n\nLet's try one last, simple rule. The `2` is a block. It falls down. `0` is empty space. `1` is a wall.\n*   A: The '2' at `(1,1)` has a '1' below it. It cannot fall.\n*   B: The '2' at `(3,6)` has a '1' below it. It cannot fall.\n*   C: The '2' at `(1,4)` has a '1' below it. It cannot fall.\n\nThis \"gravity\" idea in its simplest form doesn't work.\nWhat if the '2' represents a person and the '0's are stepping stones over a '1' river? This is getting too metaphorical.\n\nLet's assume there is a typo in `Output_B` and my very first simple rule is the correct one. The rule: \"A '2' and the first '0' (in reading order) in the grid swap places.\"\n1.  Apply to A: '2' at `(1,1)` swaps with '0' at `(0,0)`. Matches `Output_A`.\n2.  Apply to C: '2' at `(1,4)` swaps with '0' at `(0,0)`.\n    *   `Input_C`: `000000,011120,111111`\n    *   `Output_C`: `200000,011100,111111`\n\nWhy should `Output_C` be `MISSING`? Perhaps the puzzle implies that if the '2' crosses a '1' boundary, the result is missing. In A, the path from `(1,1)` to `(0,0)` doesn't cross any `1` if you can move diagonally. What about B? Path from `(3,6)` to `(0,0)` definitely crosses `1`s.\n\nLet's step back from the grid logic. Is there something about the string representation itself?\n`Input_C='000000,011120,111111'`\nNumber of 0s: 8\nNumber of 1s: 9\nNumber of 2s: 1\nTotal length: 18\n\nLet's assume the provided Output_B is correct and try to find a logic that fits A and B.\nA: (1,1) -> (0,0) | Move up-left\nB: (3,6) -> (2,7) | Move up-right\nIn A, the '2' is at the second position of its row. In B, the '2' is at the seventh position of its row.\nWhat if the horizontal move depends on the position? (Even/Odd)\n*   A: Position `1` (odd if 1-indexed) -> moves left.\n*   B: Position `6` (even if 0-indexed) -> moves right.\nLet's check C.\n*   C: '2' is at position `4` (even if 0-indexed). By this logic, it should move right. It moves up and right to an adjacent '0'. The adjacent '0's are `(0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (1,5)`. The only one to the right is `(1,5)`. This is not 'up-right'. But if we check `(0,5)`, it's a '0'. So `(1,4)` -> `(0,5)`.\n    *   If C -> `(0,5)`, `Output_C` would be `000002,011100,111111`.\n\nThis feels like over-analyzing a potentially simpler problem. The `MISSING` is the biggest clue. It implies an impossible state.\nThe only difference I can find is this: in `Input_A` and `Input_B`, the '2' is \"surrounded\" by '1's on the same row.\n`Input_A`: `121`\n`Input_B`: `021` (part of `...00211...`)\n`Input_C`: `120`\n\nWhat if the digit to the right of '2' must be a '1'? In `Input_C`, the digit to the right of '2' is a '0'. This makes the transformation \"impossible\" or \"MISSING\". Let's check.\n*   Rule: The transformation can only occur if the digit immediately to the right of the '2' is a '1'. If it's a '0', the output is MISSING.\n*   A: `Input_A` contains `...121...`. The digit to the right is '1'. The transformation proceeds.\n*   B: `Input_B` contains `...0021...`. The digit to the right is '1'. The transformation proceeds.\n*   C: `Input_C` contains `...120...`. The digit to the right is '0'. The condition is not met. Output is MISSING.\n\nThis seems like a very plausible and simple rule that explains all three cases, especially the `MISSING` part.\n\n<<<011100,000020,111111>>>\nNo, the final answer must be the value for MISSING, which my logic determined by finding a rule that results in 'MISSING' for C. I have solved the puzzle's transformation rule. The rule is that the digit to the right of the '2' must be '1'. Since it's '0' in Input_C, the output is MISSING. I have been asked to provide the value for MISSING. But the prompt asks to solve the puzzle *by transforming the input into the output*. This implies I must provide the transformed output for C. If my rule for 'MISSING' is correct, there is no transformation. It is a trick question.\n\nHowever, let's assume the question implicitly asks for the output of C *if* the condition was met. This seems unlikely.\nLet me reconsider the `Output_C` that I calculated earlier with the \"move to first adjacent '0'\" rule, ignoring the weird `Output_B`. `000200,011100,111111`. This is a possible answer.\n\nThe most logical explanation for `MISSING` is a failed precondition. My \"digit-to-the-right-must-be-1\" hypothesis is the strongest I've found that explains all examples provided, including the \"MISSING\". If the puzzle is to find the logic, then that's the logic. The prompt asks \"What is the value of MISSING?\". It doesn't say \"Calculate Output_C\". It could be a philosophical answer, or it might be that my rule about `MISSING` is wrong, and there's another computational rule.\n\nLet's assume my last hypothesis is wrong and `MISSING` isn't a special string. It's just a placeholder for the real answer.\nThe prompt is a puzzle of logic deduction. Let's try to combine my two strongest theories:\n1. `2` moves to an adjacent `0`.\n2. The destination depends on the `2`'s column index (even/odd)\n    - `A`: `(1,1)` index 1 is odd -> move left. Destination `(0,0)`.\n    - `B`: `(3,6)` index 6 is even -> move right. Destination `(2,7)`. This works for `(up, right)`\n    - `C`: `(1,4)` index 4 is even -> move right. Adjacent cells with `0` are `(0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (1,5)`. Those \"to the right\" are `(0,5)` and `(1,5)`. Which one? The one on the higher row? So `(0,5)`.\n        - Let's apply this transformation to C: `2` moves from `(1,4)` to `(0,5)`. Original `(1,4)` becomes `0`.\n        - Row 0: `000000` -> `000002`\n        - Row 1: `011120` -> `011100`\n        - Row 2: `111111` -> `111111`\n        - Final Answer: `'000002,011100,111111'`\n\nThis seems like a consistent, albeit complex, rule that handles all cases, and provides a concrete output for C instead of just \"MISSING\".\n\nLet me verify it again.\n- **Rule:** The `2` moves to an adjacent `0`. The direction is determined by the column index of the `2`. Odd index -> up-left. Even index -> up-right. If multiple choices exist, move to the one with the lowest row index.\n- **A**: `2` at `(1,1)`. Index 1 is odd. Move up-left. Adjacent `0`'s up-left is only `(0,0)`. `Output_A` matches.\n- **B**: `2` at `(3,6)`. Index 6 is even. Move up-right. Adjacent `0` up-right is `(2,7)`. `Output_B` matches.\n- **C**: `2` at `(1,4)`. Index 4 is even. Move up-right. Adjacent `0`'s are `(0,3) ... (0,5)`. Up-right adjacent is `(0,5)`.\n    - `Input_C[0]`: `000000` -> `Output_C[0]`: `000002`\n    - `Input_C[1]`: `011120` -> `Output_C[1]`: `011100`\n    - `Input_C[2]`: `111111` -> `Output_C[2]`: `111111`\n\nThis logic holds for all three examples and gives a concrete result for C. The 'MISSING' in the prompt was just a placeholder for the answer I am supposed to find.\n\nFinal answer will be `'000002,011100,111111'`.\n\n<<<000002,011100,111111>>>"
