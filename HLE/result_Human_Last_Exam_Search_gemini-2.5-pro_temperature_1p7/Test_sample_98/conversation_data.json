    "When an icosahedron-shaped tank is positioned to stand on one of its triangular faces, the uppermost face is also a parallel triangle. If this tank is filled with water to exactly half of its total volume, the surface of the water will form a horizontal plane that slices through the center of the icosahedron.\n\nThe shape of this water surface is determined by the cross-section of the icosahedron at its midpoint. Due to the high degree of symmetry in an icosahedron, this cross-section is a regular polygon. The plane of the water intersects ten of the icosahedron's twenty faces.\n\nTherefore, the shape of the water surface will be a regular decagon, which is a polygon with ten equal sides and ten equal angles.\n\n<<<a regular decagon>>>"
