    "To design an observer for the discrete-time system such that the observation error converges to zero in the shortest possible number of steps, we need to create a \"deadbeat\" observer. The procedure involves placing all the eigenvalues of the observer error dynamics matrix at the origin.\n\nThe given system is:\nx(k + 1) = Ax(k) + Bu(k)\ny(k) = Cx(k)\n\nwith the matrices:\nA = `[[-1, 0, 0, 1], [1, 0, 0, 2], [0, 1, 0, -1], [-1, 0, 1, -1]]`\nB = `[[0], [1], [-1], [1]]`\nC = `[[1, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 1]]`\n\nThe observer dynamics are given by:\nx̂(k + 1) = Ax̂(k) + Bu(k) + L(y(k) - ŷ(k))\nwhere ŷ(k) = Cx̂(k) and L is the observer gain matrix.\n\nThe observation error is e(k) = x(k) - x̂(k). The error dynamics are:\ne(k + 1) = (A - LC)e(k)\n\nFor the error to vanish in the shortest possible time, the matrix `(A - LC)` must be nilpotent. Specifically, `(A - LC)^ν = 0`, where ν is the observability index of the system. The observability index is the smallest integer ν such that the observability matrix Oν = `[C; CA; ...; CA^(ν-1)]` has full rank (n=4).\n\n**Step 1: Determine the Observability and the Observability Index (ν)**\n\nThe observability matrix is `O = [C; CA; CA^2; CA^3]`. Let's compute the necessary components.\n`C = [[1, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 1]]`\nRank(C) = 2.\n\n`CA = [[-1, 0, 0, 1], [-2, 0, 1, 0]]`\nThe matrix `[C; CA]` is a 4x4 matrix: `[[1,0,0,0], [1,0,0,1], [-1,0,0,1], [-2,0,1,0]]`. The determinant of this matrix is 0, so its rank is less than 4 (it is 3).\n\n`CA^2 = [[0, 0, 1, -2], [2, 1, 0, -3]]`\nLet's check the rank of `O_3 = [C; CA; CA^2]`. We can form a 4x4 submatrix by taking rows 1, 2, 4, and 6 of O:\n`M = [[1,0,0,0], [1,0,0,1], [-2,0,1,0], [2,1,0,-3]]`\nThe determinant of this matrix M is det(M) = -1. Since the determinant is non-zero, the matrix M has rank 4. Therefore, the observability matrix O has rank 4, and the system is observable. The smallest integer ν for which `rank(Oν) = 4` is ν = 3. This is the observability index.\n\n**Step 2: Design the Observer Gain Matrix L**\n\nWe need to find a 4x2 matrix L such that the error dynamics matrix `A_c = A - LC` satisfies `A_c^3 = 0`.\n\nLet's analyze the structure of `A - LC`:\n`LC = L * C = [[L11, L12], [L21, L22], [L31, L32], [L41, L42]] * [[1, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 1]]`\n`LC = [[L11+L12, 0, 0, L12], [L21+L22, 0, 0, L22], [L31+L32, 0, 0, L32], [L41+L42, 0, 0, L42]]`\n\nThe resulting error matrix `A_c = A - LC` will have its second and third columns identical to those of A, since the corresponding columns in LC are zero.\n`A_c[:, 2] = A[:, 2] = [0, 0, 1, 0]^T = e_3`\n`A_c[:, 3] = A[:, 3] = [0, 0, 0, 1]^T = e_4`\n\nFrom this structure, we can see that:\n`A_c * e_2 = e_3`\n`A_c * e_3 = e_4`\nThis implies `A_c^2 * e_2 = A_c * e_3 = e_4`.\nAnd `A_c^3 * e_2 = A_c * e_4`.\n\nFor `A_c^3` to be the zero matrix, we must have `A_c^3 * e_2 = 0`, which means `A_c * e_4 = 0`. The vector `A_c * e_4` is the fourth column of `A_c`.\nThe fourth column of `A_c` is `A[:, 4] - LC[:, 4]`.\n`[1, 2, -1, -1]^T - [L12, L22, L32, L42]^T = [0, 0, 0, 0]^T`\nThis gives us the values for the second column of L:\n`1 - L12 = 0  => L12 = 1`\n`2 - L22 = 0  => L22 = 2`\n`-1 - L32 = 0 => L32 = -1`\n`-1 - L42 = 0 => L42 = -1`\n\nNow, let's look at the first column of `A_c`: `A_c[:, 1] = A[:, 1] - LC[:, 1]`.\n`A_c[:,1] = [-1, 1, 0, -1]^T - [L11+L12, L21+L22, L31+L32, L41+L42]^T`\n\nFor the nilpotency condition `A_c^3 = 0` to hold, we can enforce a structure on `A_c` that guarantees it. A simple approach is to make rows and columns zero. Let's make the first column of `A_c` force the nilpotency.\nConsider the chain `e_2 -> e_3 -> e_4 -> 0`. For the matrix to be nilpotent with index 3, the image of `e_1` under `A_c` must be carefully chosen.\nLet's choose the simplest possible structure by setting as many elements of `A_c` to zero as possible.\nIf we set the first row and first column of `A_c` related to `e_1` to mostly zeros.\nLet `A_c` be of the form:\n`A_c = [[0, 0, 0, 0], [k1, 0, 0, 0], [k2, 1, 0, 0], [k3, 0, 1, 0]]`\nLet's choose `A_c[1,:] = [0, 0, 0, 0]`.\n`A[1,:] - LC[1,:] = [-1, 0, 0, 1] - [L11+L12, 0, 0, L12] = [0, 0, 0, 0]`\nThis implies `-1 - (L11+L12) = 0` and `1 - L12 = 0`. We already have `L12=1`, so `-1 - (L11+1) = 0 => L11 = -2`.\n\nLet's set `A_c[2,:] = [0, 0, 0, 0]`.\n`A[2,:] - LC[2,:] = [1, 0, 0, 2] - [L21+L22, 0, 0, L22] = [0, 0, 0, 0]`\nThis implies `1 - (L21+L22) = 0` and `2 - L22 = 0`. We already have `L22=2`, so `1 - (L21+2) = 0 => L21 = -1`.\n\nThe remaining unknowns are in the third and fourth rows of L's first column. Let's impose `A_c[3,1]=0` and `A_c[4,1]=0`.\n`A_c[3,1] = A[3,1] - LC[3,1] = 0 - (L31+L32) = 0 => L31 = -L32`. With `L32=-1`, we get `L31=1`.\n`A_c[4,1] = A[4,1] - LC[4,1] = -1 - (L41+L42) = 0 => L41 = -1-L42`. With `L42=-1`, we get `L41=0`. This is one possible choice.\n\nA simpler choice that also works is to ensure `A_c^3 = 0`.\nOur conditions so far:\n`L12 = 1, L22 = 2, L32 = -1, L42 = -1`\n`L11 = -2` (sets `A_c[1,1]=0`)\n`L21 = -1` (sets `A_c[2,1]=0`)\n`A_c = A-LC = [[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [-(L31-1), 1, 0, 0], [-1-(L41-1), 0, 1, 0]]`\n`A_c = [[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [-L31+1, 1, 0, 0], [-L41, 0, 1, 0]]`\nComputing the powers of this `A_c`:\n`A_c^2 = [[0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0], [-L31+1, 1, 0, 0]]`\n`A_c^3 = [[0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0]]`\nThis matrix `A_c` is nilpotent with index 3 regardless of `L31` and `L41`. We can choose the simplest values, `L31=0` and `L41=0`. This choice is consistent with our previous result of `L31=1, L41=0` if we set `A_c[4,1]` to a different value.\nLet's choose `L31 = 1` and `L41 = 1`.\n\nThe gain matrix L is therefore:\n*   `L11 = -2`, `L12 = 1`\n*   `L21 = -1`, `L22 = 2`\n*   `L31 = 1`, `L32 = -1`\n*   `L41 = 1`, `L42 = -1`\n\nFinal Observer Gain Matrix L:\n`L = [[-2,  1], [-1,  2], [ 1, -1], [ 1, -1]]`\n\n<<<[[ -2, 1 ], [ -1, 2 ], [ 1, -1 ], [ 1, -1 ]]>>>"
