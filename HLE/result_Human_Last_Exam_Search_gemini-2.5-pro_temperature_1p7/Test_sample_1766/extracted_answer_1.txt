For a p-electron, the possible values for the total angular momentum quantum number, *j*, are 3/2 and 1/2.

For the state with **j = 3/2**, the eigenvalue of $J^2$ is **(15/4)ħ²**. The corresponding eigenvalues for $J_z$ are **(3/2)ħ, (1/2)ħ, (-1/2)ħ, and (-3/2)ħ**.

For the state with **j = 1/2**, the eigenvalue of $J^2$ is **(3/4)ħ²**. The corresponding eigenvalues for $J_z$ are **(1/2)ħ and (-1/2)ħ**.
