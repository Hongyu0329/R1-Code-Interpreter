The quantum correction to the conductivity for an electron in a bulk semiconductor, due to weak localization, is given by the formula δσ ≈ (e² / (2π²ħ)) \* (1/L_φ), where e is the elementary charge, ħ is the reduced Planck constant, and L_φ is the phase coherence length. This correction is negative with respect to the classical Drude conductivity, meaning it increases the resistivity. The magnitude of the correction is inversely proportional to the phase coherence length, which increases as the temperature decreases.
