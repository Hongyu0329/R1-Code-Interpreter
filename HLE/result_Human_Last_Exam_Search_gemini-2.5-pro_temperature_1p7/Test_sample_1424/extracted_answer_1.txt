In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function G_0 is inversely proportional to the single-particle energy eigenvalues ϵ_k. In frequency-momentum space, the functional dependence is expressed as G_0(k, ω) = 1 / (ω - ϵ_k + iη), where ω is the frequency and iη is an infinitesimal term for convergence.
