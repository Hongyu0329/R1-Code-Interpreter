    "The man Andrei Voznesensky called \"a joy-discovering sailor\" and whose grave was rediscovered in the late 1980s is Nikolai Petrovich Rezanov.\n\nAndrei Voznesensky's narrative poem \"Avos!\" (1970), which was later adapted into the famous rock opera \"Juno and Avos\" (1981), tells the story of the Russian nobleman and explorer Nikolai Rezanov (1764–1807). The opera became a major cultural phenomenon in the Soviet Union.\n\nRezanov was a key figure in the Russian-American Company and undertook a mission to California in 1806. There, he fell in love with Concepción Argüello, the daughter of the Spanish governor of San Francisco. Rezanov died of fever and exhaustion in Krasnoyarsk, Siberia, on his return journey to St. Petersburg to seek permission to marry her.\n\nHis original gravestone in Krasnoyarsk was destroyed in the 1960s. While some accounts suggest his remains were moved in the late 1950s, the late 1980s saw a renewed interest in his story, leading to the eventual identification of his burial site. In 2000, a new monument was erected on his grave at the Trinity Cemetery in Krasnoyarsk. This monument features a white cross with the inscription, \"I will never forget you\" and \"I will never see you again,\" a direct quote from Voznesensky's work.\n\n<<<Rezanov>>>"
