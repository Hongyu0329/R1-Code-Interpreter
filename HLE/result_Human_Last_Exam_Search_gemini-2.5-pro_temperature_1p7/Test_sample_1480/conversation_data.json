    "The provided information confirms the core steps of a fuzzy inference process, particularly for a Mamdani-style system.\n\n1.  **Rule Firing Strength / Activation Level:** A fuzzy rule has an antecedent (\"IF\" part) and a consequent (\"THEN\" part). The first step in evaluating a rule is to determine the degree to which the antecedent is satisfied for a given input. This result is a single numerical value (in a Type-1 system) called the rule's firing strength, firing level, or activation level. The user provides this value as `Phi_k(x′) = 0.7`.\n\n2.  **Implication:** The next step is implication, where the firing strength from the antecedent is used to modify the fuzzy set of the consequent. This step determines the output fuzzy set for that specific rule. The process involves combining the firing strength with the membership function of the consequent. This combination is done using a chosen implication method, which is typically a t-norm operation.\n\n3.  **T-Norms for Implication:** The most common t-norms used for implication in Mamdani systems are the minimum (`min`) and product (`prod`) operators.\n    *   The `min` method truncates the consequent's membership function at the height of the firing strength.\n    *   The `prod` method scales the consequent's membership function by the firing strength.\n\n4.  **The Question's Ambiguity:** The user asks for the \"rule activation level ... *using* a t-norm operation\" between `Phi_k(x′)` (the antecedent's firing strength) and `μG_k_j(y_j)` (a membership grade in the consequent). While \"rule activation level\" often refers to the antecedent's firing strength alone (0.7), the request to use a t-norm with the consequent value points strongly to the result of the implication step for the specific output value `y_j`. This calculates the membership grade in the rule's *output* fuzzy set.\n\n5.  **Role of \"Interval Type-3\":** In a genuine interval type-3 system, the firing strength and membership functions would not be simple numbers but more complex fuzzy sets. However, since the user has provided crisp numerical values (0.7 and 0.9), it indicates that the question is about the fundamental principle of fuzzy implication, which remains the same across different types. The operations are simply applied to the more complex structures in higher-type systems. The problem is effectively a Type-1 calculation, which forms the basis for higher types.\n\n**Conclusion of Logic:**\nThe question asks for the result of applying a t-norm operation to the antecedent's firing strength and a consequent's membership grade. I will perform this calculation using the two most common t-norms for fuzzy implication.\n\n*   **Given Firing Strength (Antecedent Activation):** `Phi_k(x′) = 0.7`\n*   **Given Consequent Membership Grade:** `μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9`\n\n*   **Calculation with Minimum T-Norm:** `min(0.7, 0.9) = 0.7`\n*   **Calculation with Product T-Norm:** `0.7 * 0.9 = 0.63`\n\nI will present the answer for both common t-norms as the specific one was not provided.\n\nFinal Answer seems ready.In the context of a Mamdani fuzzy inference system, the \"rule activation level\" typically refers to the firing strength of the antecedent (the \"IF\" part of the rule). In this case, that value is given as `Phi_k(x′) = 0.7`.\n\nHowever, the question specifically asks for the result of using a t-norm operation to combine this firing strength with the membership grade of the consequent (the \"THEN\" part of the rule), `μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9`. This process is known as **implication**. The result of the implication is the membership grade of the output `y_j` in the final fuzzy set for that specific rule.\n\nThe \"interval type-3\" designation points to a highly complex system where membership grades are themselves fuzzy sets. However, because the values provided are crisp numbers (0.7 and 0.9), the question boils down to the fundamental calculation at the core of any fuzzy system.\n\nThe result depends on the specific t-norm used. The two most common t-norms for implication are the minimum and the product.\n\n### Calculation\n\nGiven values:\n*   Antecedent firing strength `(Phi_k(x′))`: **0.7**\n*   Consequent membership grade `(μG_k_j(y_j))`: **0.9**\n\nThe rule activation level, interpreted as the result of the implication, is calculated as follows:\n\n1.  **Using the Minimum t-norm:** The output is truncated at the level of the firing strength.\n    *   `min(0.7, 0.9) = 0.7`\n\n2.  **Using the Product t-norm:** The output is scaled by the firing strength.\n    *   `0.7 * 0.9 = 0.63`\n\nSince the specific t-norm was not defined in the question, the rule activation level resulting from the implication step would be **0.7** if using the minimum t-norm or **0.63** if using the product t-norm.\n\n<<<The rule activation level after implication is 0.7 using the minimum t-norm or 0.63 using the product t-norm.>>>"
