    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Parametric Curve**\n\nThe curve is defined by the parametric equations:\n$x = \\cos t$\n$y = b \\sin t$\nfor $t \\in [0, 2\\pi)$. The value of `b` depends on the interval of `t`:\n1.  For $t \\in [0, \\pi]$, $b=1$.\n2.  For $t \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$, $b=5$.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the two parts of the curve separately**\n\n**Part 1:  $t \\in [0, \\pi]$**\nIn this interval, the equations are $x = \\cos t$ and $y = \\sin t$.\n*   We can find the Cartesian equation by noting that $x^2 + y^2 = \\cos^2 t + \\sin^2 t = 1$. This is the equation of a unit circle centered at the origin (0,0).\n*   Let's trace the path:\n    *   At $t=0$: $(x, y) = (\\cos 0, \\sin 0) = (1, 0)$.\n    *   At $t=\\pi/2$: $(x, y) = (\\cos \\pi/2, \\sin \\pi/2) = (0, 1)$.\n    *   At $t=\\pi$: $(x, y) = (\\cos \\pi, \\sin \\pi) = (-1, 0)$.\n*   Since $t$ is in $[0, \\pi]$, $\\sin t \\ge 0$, which means $y \\ge 0$.\n*   Therefore, this part of the curve is the **upper half of the unit circle**.\n\n**Part 2: $t \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$**\nIn this interval, the equations are $x = \\cos t$ and $y = 5\\sin t$.\n*   We can find the Cartesian equation: $x^2 + (y/5)^2 = \\cos^2 t + (5\\sin t/5)^2 = \\cos^2 t + \\sin^2 t = 1$. This gives the equation $x^2 + \\frac{y^2}{25} = 1$. This is the equation of an ellipse centered at the origin, with a semi-minor axis of length 1 along the x-axis and a semi-major axis of length 5 along the y-axis.\n*   Let's trace the path:\n    *   As $t$ approaches $\\pi$ from above: $(x, y) \\to (\\cos \\pi, 5\\sin \\pi) = (-1, 0)$. This point connects smoothly with the end of the first part.\n    *   At $t=3\\pi/2$: $(x, y) = (\\cos 3\\pi/2, 5\\sin 3\\pi/2) = (0, -5)$.\n    *   As $t$ approaches $2\\pi$: $(x, y) \\to (\\cos 2\\pi, 5\\sin 2\\pi) = (1, 0)$. This point connects back to the start of the first part, forming a closed loop.\n*   Since $t$ is in $(\\pi, 2\\pi)$, $\\sin t \\le 0$, which means $y \\le 0$.\n*   Therefore, this part of the curve is the **lower half of the ellipse** $x^2 + \\frac{y^2}{25} = 1$.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Bounding Box of the Figure**\n\nTo find the smallest square that encloses the figure, we first need to find the overall dimensions of the figure (its bounding box). We need the minimum and maximum values for `x` and `y`.\n\n*   **Range of x:** The equation for x is always $x = \\cos t$ for $t \\in [0, 2\\pi)$. The cosine function ranges from -1 to 1.\n    *   $x_{min} = -1$ (occurs at $t=\\pi$)\n    *   $x_{max} = 1$ (occurs at $t=0$)\n*   The **width** of the figure is $x_{max} - x_{min} = 1 - (-1) = 2$.\n\n*   **Range of y:** We need to consider both parts of the curve.\n    *   For the upper semi-circle ($t \\in [0, \\pi]$), $y=\\sin t$ ranges from 0 to 1. So, $y_{max} = 1$.\n    *   For the lower semi-ellipse ($t \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$), $y=5\\sin t$. Since $\\sin t$ ranges from -1 to 0 in this interval, $y$ ranges from $5 \\times (-1) = -5$ to $5 \\times 0 = 0$. So, $y_{min} = -5$.\n*   The overall range for y is from -5 to 1.\n*   The **height** of the figure is $y_{max} - y_{min} = 1 - (-5) = 6$.\n\n**Step 4: Find the Smallest Circumscribing Square**\n\nThe smallest square that can enclose the figure must have a side length equal to the larger of the figure's width and height. This is because the square must be wide enough and tall enough to contain the entire figure.\n\n*   Width = 2\n*   Height = 6\n*   The side length of the smallest square, `s`, must be at least 2 and at least 6.\n*   Therefore, the minimum side length is $s = \\max(2, 6) = 6$.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Area of the Square**\n\nThe area of a square with side length `s` is $s^2$.\n*   Area = $s^2 = 6^2 = 36$.\n\n**Careful points:**\n*   Recognize the piecewise nature of the curve based on the parameter `b`.\n*   Correctly identify the two geometric shapes being combined (a semi-circle and a semi-ellipse).\n*   Find the global maximum and minimum for `x` and `y` by considering both pieces of the curve. A common mistake would be to only look at one piece.\n*   Understand that the side of the smallest \"outcircling\" or circumscribing square is determined by the maximum dimension (width or height) of the figure's bounding box.\n\nFinal Answer Calculation:\n*   Figure Width = 2\n*   Figure Height = 6\n*   Square Side Length = max(2, 6) = 6\n*   Square Area = 6 * 6 = 36\n\n<<<36>>>"
