    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Question:** The question asks to identify the person whose lectures Albert Einstein cited in his specific 1905 paper on Brownian motion.\n\n2.  **Identify the Specific Paper:** The paper is one of Einstein's four \"Annus Mirabilis\" (Miracle Year) papers from 1905. Its title is \"Über die von der molekularkinetischen Theorie der Wärme geforderte Bewegung von in ruhenden Flüssigkeiten suspendierten Teilchen\" (\"On the Motion of Small Particles Suspended in a Stationary Liquid, as Required by the Molecular-Kinetic Theory of Heat\").\n\n3.  **Analyze the Nature of Scientific Citations:** In scientific papers, authors cite previous work to give credit, build on existing knowledge, or refer to a specific concept or method. The question specifically mentions \"lectures.\" This could refer to lectures Einstein personally attended or, more commonly in that era, to published volumes of lecture notes.\n\n4.  **Examine the Content of Einstein's Paper:** The paper's central achievement is connecting the random, visible motion of suspended particles (Brownian motion) to the invisible, random motion of molecules in the liquid, as predicted by the kinetic theory of heat. To do this, Einstein uses concepts from statistical mechanics and thermodynamics.\n\n5.  **Locate the Relevant Citation in the Paper:** A crucial part of Einstein's argument involves the statistical interpretation of the second law of thermodynamics, specifically the relationship between a system's entropy (S) and its probability (W). This relationship is famously expressed in the formula S = k log W.\n\n6.  **Identify the Cited Individual:** When introducing this concept in his paper, Einstein makes a direct reference. He states that for the relationship between entropy and state-probability, he will follow the treatment of a particular physicist. That physicist is **Ludwig Boltzmann**.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Attended vs. Published Lectures:** Einstein did not personally attend lectures by Ludwig Boltzmann, who was primarily active in Vienna and Graz while Einstein was a student in Zurich and later an employee in Bern. Einstein's reference is to Boltzmann's published works, particularly his influential \"Lectures on Gas Theory\" (*Vorlesungen über Gastheorie*). He studied these texts privately and deeply admired Boltzmann's approach.\n*   **The Specific Concept:** The citation is not a general one but is tied specifically to the foundational idea in statistical mechanics that entropy is a logarithmic measure of probability. Einstein explicitly notes he is following \"Boltzmann's procedure\" in this regard.\n*   **Few Citations:** It is a well-known characteristic of Einstein's 1905 papers that they contain very few citations. This makes the specific mention of Boltzmann particularly significant, highlighting the profound influence Boltzmann's work had on Einstein's thinking.\n\nBy following these steps, we can confidently determine the correct answer.\n\n<<<Ludwig Boltzmann>>>"
