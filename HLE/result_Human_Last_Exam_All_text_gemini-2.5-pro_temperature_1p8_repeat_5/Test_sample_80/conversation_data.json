    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Goal and the Board\nThe goal is to place the maximum possible number of non-attacking bishops on the edge squares of a standard 8x8 chessboard. The question asks for the number of edge squares that will be left empty.\n\n### Step 2: Identify and Count the Edge Squares\nThe edge squares are all the squares on the first and eighth ranks, and the 'a' and 'h' files.\n*   **Rank 1:** 8 squares\n*   **Rank 8:** 8 squares\n*   **File 'a' (excluding corners already counted):** 6 squares (a2 to a7)\n*   **File 'h' (excluding corners already counted):** 6 squares (h2 to h7)\n*   **Total Edge Squares:** 8 + 8 + 6 + 6 = 28 squares.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Bishop's Movement and Properties\nThe crucial property of a bishop is that it always stays on squares of the same color. A bishop on a light-colored square can only attack pieces on other light-colored squares. Similarly, a bishop on a dark-colored square can only attack pieces on other dark-colored squares.\n\n### Step 4: Decompose the Problem by Color\nThis property allows us to break the problem into two smaller, independent problems:\n1.  Find the maximum number of non-attacking bishops that can be placed on the **light-colored edge squares**.\n2.  Find the maximum number of non-attacking bishops that can be placed on the **dark-colored edge squares**.\n\nThe total maximum number of bishops will be the sum of the solutions to these two problems.\n\n### Step 5: Count the Edge Squares by Color\nThe 28 edge squares are divided equally by color. You can verify this by counting, or by noticing the symmetrical, alternating pattern of the edges.\n*   **Number of Light-Colored Edge Squares:** 14\n*   **Number of Dark-Colored Edge Squares:** 14\n\n### Step 6: Solve for One Color (e.g., Light Squares)\nLet's find the maximum number of non-attacking bishops we can place on the 14 light-colored edge squares.\n*   A careful placement strategy reveals a valid arrangement. Consider placing bishops on all the light squares of the first rank: **b1, d1, f1, h1**. This gives us 4 bishops that do not attack each other.\n*   These 4 bishops attack several other light edge squares:\n    *   b1 attacks a2 and h7.\n    *   d1 attacks a4 and h5.\n    *   f1 attacks a6 and h3.\n    *   h1 attacks a8.\n*   This leaves three light edge squares that are not attacked and can still hold bishops: **c8, e8, g8**. These three do not attack each other.\n*   Therefore, a valid placement of non-attacking bishops on the light edge squares is {b1, d1, f1, h1, c8, e8, g8}.\n*   **Maximum Bishops on Light Squares:** 4 + 3 = 7.\n    *(Note: It can be proven this is the maximum, as the 14 light edge squares form 7 pairs of mutually attacking squares, and you can only pick one bishop from each pair).*\n\n### Step 7: Solve for the Other Color (Dark Squares)\nDue to the symmetry of the chessboard, the problem for the 14 dark edge squares is identical to the one for the light squares. Therefore, the maximum number of non-attacking bishops that can be placed on the dark edge squares is also **7**.\n\n### Step 8: Calculate the Total Maximum Number of Bishops\nThe total number of bishops that can be placed on all edge squares is the sum of the maximums for each color.\n*   **Total Maximum Bishops:** (Max on Light) + (Max on Dark) = 7 + 7 = 14 bishops.\n\n### Step 9: Find the Number of Empty Edge Squares\nThe final step is to answer the specific question asked: how many edge squares would lack bishops?\n*   **Total Edge Squares:** 28\n*   **Maximum Bishops Placed:** 14\n*   **Empty Edge Squares:** 28 - 14 = 14.\n\nIf the players succeeded in placing the maximum number of bishops, 14 edge squares would have a bishop, and 14 would not.\n\n<<<14>>>"
