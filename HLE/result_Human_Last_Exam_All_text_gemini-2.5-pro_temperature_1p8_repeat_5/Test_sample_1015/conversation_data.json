    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the differences between a cambré derrière in the Vaganova and Balanchine methods, followed by the final answer.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Understand the Movement: Cambré Derrière**\n    *   A cambré is a bend of the body from the waist.\n    *   \"Derrière\" means \"to the back.\"\n    *   Therefore, a cambré derrière is a backward bend of the upper body.\n    *   The key body parts involved are the spine, head, arms, and hips. Proper execution requires a balance of flexibility in the spine and stability in the lower body.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Vaganova Method Approach**\n    *   **Core Principle:** The Vaganova method, developed by Agrippina Vaganova, emphasizes strength, precision, and stability. The foundation of all movements is a strong, stable core and pelvis.\n    *   **Execution of Cambré Derrière:**\n        *   **Hips:** The hips must remain completely still and square to the front. Pushing the hips forward is considered a major technical fault. The dancer is taught to \"lift up and out\" of the hips before bending.\n        *   **Spine:** The bend initiates from the upper thoracic spine (the part of the spine between the shoulder blades). It is a pure arch of the upper back.\n        *   **Head:** The head follows the line of the spine, looking up towards the ceiling and then back, but it is a controlled movement, not a dramatic drop.\n        *   **Goal:** The aim is to demonstrate spinal flexibility and control while maintaining perfect pelvic alignment. The aesthetic is clean, elegant, and controlled.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Balanchine Method/Style Approach**\n    *   **Core Principle:** The Balanchine style, developed by George Balanchine, prioritizes speed, dynamism, and creating long, often unconventional, lines. It pushes the boundaries of classical technique to create a visually striking and athletic aesthetic.\n    *   **Execution of Cambré Derrière:**\n        *   **Hips:** This is the most significant point of difference. The Balanchine style not only allows but often *encourages* the dancer to press the hips forward as the upper body bends back.\n        *   **Spine:** This forward hip placement facilitates a much deeper, more dramatic-looking arch that involves the entire spine, creating a \"broken\" line at the hips.\n        *   **Head:** The head is often released back more dramatically to accentuate the depth of the bend.\n        *   **Goal:** The aim is to create a large, dynamic, and visually exciting shape. It is less about maintaining a pure classical line and more about achieving an extreme aesthetic.\n\n**Careful Points and Comparison**\n\n*   **Point of Contrast:** The most fundamental and defining technical difference lies in the action of the hips. Vaganova forbids hip movement, while Balanchine utilizes it.\n*   **Consequences of the Difference:**\n    *   **Degree of Backbend (D):** The Balanchine method's forward hip placement often results in a visually deeper backbend. However, this is a *result* of the hip placement, not the primary technical instruction. The core difference is *how* that bend is achieved.\n    *   **Placement of Head (E):** The head placement in both styles follows the line of the spine. The more extreme bend in the Balanchine style leads to a more dramatic head position, but this is also a secondary effect.\n    *   **Speed (C):** While Balanchine's work is generally characterized by speed, a cambré can be performed at any tempo in either style. The technical execution (hip placement) remains the distinguishing factor regardless of the speed.\n    *   **Arm Placement (A):** While there may be stylistic nuances in the *port de bras* (arm movements), the fundamental difference that defines the movement's mechanics is not in the arms but in the torso and hips.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the primary and most critical difference between a cambré derrière in the Vaganova and Balanchine methods is the placement and action of the hips.\n\n<<<B>>>"
