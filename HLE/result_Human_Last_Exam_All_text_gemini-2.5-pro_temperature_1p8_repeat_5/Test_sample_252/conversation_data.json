    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Goal:** The objective is to \"construct a full spectral volume\". A spectral volume, also known as a hyperspectral data cube, is a three-dimensional dataset with two spatial dimensions (x, y) and one spectral dimension (wavelength, λ). So, we are trying to reconstruct a function `f(x, y, λ)`.\n\n2.  **Deconstruct the Method:** The method specified is \"computed tomography\" (CT). In traditional medical imaging, CT reconstructs a 3D object (like a human body) from a series of 2D X-ray projections taken from different angles. The mathematical principle behind this is that an object can be reconstructed from a sufficient number of its projections. The core theorem governing this is the Fourier Slice Theorem, which relates the Fourier transform of a projection to a \"slice\" of the Fourier transform of the object itself.\n\n3.  **Deconstruct the Hardware and Constraints:**\n    *   **Diffraction Grating:** A diffraction grating's function is to disperse light based on its wavelength. When light from the scene passes through a grating, it is spread out into a spectrum. This dispersion process is effectively creating a \"projection\" of the 3D data cube `f(x, y, λ)` onto the 2D detector.\n    *   **Single Image:** All the information required for the reconstruction must be captured in a single snapshot on one 2D detector (e.g., a CCD or CMOS sensor). This means that all the necessary projections must be formed on the detector plane simultaneously.\n\n4.  **Connecting the Pieces:**\n    *   A single diffraction grating will disperse light in one specific direction. For example, a grating oriented horizontally will spread the spectrum of each point source `(x, y)` along a horizontal line on the detector. This creates one projection of the 3D data cube.\n    *   However, the fundamental principle of computed tomography is that a single projection is insufficient to reconstruct a multi-dimensional object. A single view provides ambiguous information. For example, you cannot determine the 3D structure of an object from a single shadow it casts.\n    *   To perform a tomographic reconstruction, multiple projections from different \"angles\" are required. In this context, a different \"angle\" means a different direction of spectral dispersion.\n\n5.  **Determining the Minimum Number of Projections/Gratings:**\n    *   **One Grating (One Projection):** Not sufficient for tomographic reconstruction. This leads to an ill-posed problem with infinite possible solutions for the `f(x, y, λ)` cube.\n    *   **Two Gratings (Two Projections):** If we use two gratings oriented at different angles (e.g., 0 and 90 degrees), we can obtain two distinct projections on the detector. While it's mathematically possible to run a reconstruction algorithm with two projections, the reconstruction of a 3D object from only two projections is still highly underdetermined and prone to severe artifacts. The two projections (visualized as two planes in the 3D Fourier space of the data cube) are not enough to stably \"constrain\" the entire 3D space.\n    *   **Three Gratings (Three Projections):** According to the mathematical theory of tomography (related to the Radon transform), to uniquely and stably reconstruct a function in 3-dimensional space, one requires projections from at least **three** non-coplanar directions. In terms of the Fourier Slice Theorem, three projections provide three different slices through the object's 3D Fourier transform. As long as these slices are not co-planar (i.e., the gratings are not oriented in a redundant way), they provide enough information to form a stable basis for reconstructing the entire 3D Fourier space, and thus the 3D data cube `f(x, y, λ)`.\n\n### List of Careful Points\n\n*   **\"Full spectral volume\"**: This phrasing implies a desire for a complete and mathematically stable or unique reconstruction, not just a crude estimate that could be generated from an insufficient number of projections.\n*   **\"Computed tomography\"**: This specific term invokes the rigorous mathematical framework of tomographic reconstruction, which has well-defined requirements on the number of projections needed for uniqueness. It distinguishes the method from other techniques like compressed sensing, which might have different requirements.\n*   **Distinction between Possibility and Uniqueness**: It might be *possible* to get an image with two projections, but it would not be a unique or robust reconstruction of the \"full\" volume. Three projections is the established minimum for a unique solution in 3D tomographic inversion.\n*   **Physical Implementation**: The problem assumes it is physically possible to project the images from multiple gratings onto a single sensor. This is indeed feasible using optical systems with beam splitters or image-replicating optics (like a lenslet array) where different sub-images pass through differently oriented gratings.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nBased on the analysis, a single grating is insufficient. Two gratings are the bare minimum to even attempt a tomographic reconstruction but lead to a mathematically ill-posed problem for a \"full\" 3D volume. The minimum number of projections required by the mathematics of 3D computed tomography for a stable and unique reconstruction is three. Since each grating provides one projection, the minimum number of gratings is three.\n\n<<<C>>>"
