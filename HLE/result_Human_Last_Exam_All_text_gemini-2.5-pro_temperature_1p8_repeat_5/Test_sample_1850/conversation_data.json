    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of historical saints mentioned by name in Milton's *Paradise Lost*.\n\n### Step 1: Defining the Key Terms\nFirst, we must be clear about the terms in the question:\n*   **\"Paradise Lost\"**: The analysis must be confined strictly to John Milton's epic poem, excluding his other works like *Paradise Regained* or his prose.\n*   **\"Historical Saint\"**: This refers to an individual who is a recognized historical figure (i.e., lived after the biblical era began to be historically documented) and is venerated or canonized as a saint within major Christian traditions. While figures like Moses or Abraham are holy, they are generally categorized as pre-historical or biblical patriarchs. Apostles like Peter exist in a grey area, but are universally considered both historical figures and saints.\n*   **\"Mentioned by name\"**: The saint's name must appear in the text, either directly or through a clear, unambiguous derivative (like an order named after them). A mere allusion to their deeds without using their name would not count.\n\n### Step 2: Conducting the Textual Search\nThe most effective way to answer this is to perform a targeted search of the text of *Paradise Lost*. Most references to historical figures outside the immediate biblical narrative appear in similes, authorial asides, or historical visions. A key passage is the description of the Limbo of Vanity in Book III, where Milton satirizes what he viewed as the empty rituals of the Roman Catholic Church.\n\n### Step 3: Identifying and Analyzing the Mentions\nA close reading of *Paradise Lost*, particularly Book III, reveals the following specific mentions:\n\n1.  **Dominic:** In the Limbo of Vanity passage, Milton mocks those who believe they can get into heaven through superficial means. He writes:\n    > \"And they who to be sure of Paradise\n    > Dying put on the weeds of **Dominic**...\" (Book III, lines 478-479)\n    This is a direct mention of St. Dominic de Guzmán (c. 1170–1221), founder of the Dominican Order. He is a historical saint. **(Count: 1)**\n\n2.  **Francis:** In the very next line, Milton continues his critique:\n    > \"...Or in **Franciscan** think to pass disguised;\" (Book III, line 480)\n    \"Franciscan\" refers to the order founded by St. Francis of Assisi (c. 1181–1226). While his name \"Francis\" is not used as a noun, the term \"Franciscan\" is a direct eponym derived from his name. In the parallel structure with \"Dominic,\" it is clear that Milton is referring to the founder by naming his order. This qualifies as being \"mentioned by name.\" **(Count: 2)**\n\n3.  **Peter:** A few lines later, Milton describes the futility of these souls' journey:\n    > \"And now **Saint Peter** at Heaven's wicket seems\n    > To wait them with his keys...\" (Book III, lines 484-485)\n    This is an unmistakable reference to the Apostle Peter, the historical figure and saint traditionally seen as the gatekeeper of Heaven. **(Count: 3)**\n\n### Step 4: Verifying the Absence of Others\nA complete search of the poem for other major historical saints yields no results.\n*   Names like **Augustine, Jerome, Ambrose, Aquinas, or Constantine** do not appear in *Paradise Lost*, although Milton engages with their ideas or mentions them in his prose works.\n*   Apostles other than Peter, such as **Paul** or **John** (as the Evangelist), are not mentioned by name, though their theology and writings are central to the poem's Christian framework.\n*   The lengthy historical visions presented by the Archangel Michael to Adam in Books XI and XII focus exclusively on figures from the Old Testament (Noah, Abraham, Moses, David, etc.) and the coming of the Messiah. The prophecy stops short of naming figures from later church history.\n\n### Conclusion\nBased on a careful analysis of the text, Milton only mentions three historical saints by name in *Paradise Lost*. All three mentions occur in a single satirical passage in Book III.\n\nThe three saints are:\n1.  St. Dominic\n2.  St. Francis\n3.  St. Peter\n\n<<<3>>>"
