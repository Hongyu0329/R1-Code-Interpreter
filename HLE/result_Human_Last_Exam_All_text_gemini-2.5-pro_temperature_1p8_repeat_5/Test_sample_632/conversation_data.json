    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Location:** Piazza della Rotonda, Rome (the square in front of the Pantheon).\n    *   **Object of Interest:** A \"unique architectural feature.\"\n    *   **Key Timeframe:** It existed *until 1950*.\n    *   **Action:** It was \"removed by the city administration.\"\n    *   **Goal:** Identify this specific feature.\n\n2.  **Initial Research and Elimination of Possibilities:**\n    *   **The Pantheon itself:** The church was not removed.\n    *   **The Fontana del Pantheon (fountain) and its Obelisk:** These are still the central features of the square today and were not removed.\n    *   **The \"Donkey's Ears\" Bell Towers on the Pantheon:** These twin baroque towers, added by Bernini, were indeed a controversial architectural feature. However, they were removed in 1883, which does not match the 1950 timeframe given in the question.\n    *   **Buildings surrounding the square:** While some buildings may have been restored or altered over time, no single, prominent building was removed from the square in 1950 that fits the description.\n\n3.  **Investigating the Correct Feature:**\n    *   By examining historical photographs of the Piazza della Rotonda from the early 20th century (e.g., the 1920s-1940s), a distinct feature becomes apparent that is absent today.\n    *   These photos clearly show tram lines running through the square.\n    *   What made this \"unique\" was its configuration: the tracks formed a complete circle, or loop (*anello tranviario* in Italian), around the central fountain. This allowed trams to turn around in the busy square.\n    *   This tram loop was a prominent and noisy feature, considered by many to be an eyesore that detracted from the grandeur of the Pantheon and the historic square.\n    *   Following World War II, Rome's city administration began a process of modernizing public transport and \"beautifying\" its historic center. This involved removing many tram lines and replacing them with buses.\n    *   The removal of the tram loop from the Piazza della Rotonda was part of this initiative, undertaken in preparation for the 1950 Holy Year (*Giubileo*) to improve the square's appearance and traffic flow.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Interpretation of \"Architectural Feature\":** While tram lines are more accurately classified as urban infrastructure, their specific, designed layout as a full circle within a historic square made them a significant and defining feature of the built environment. In the context of the question, it's the most fitting description for a man-made structure removed at that specific time.\n*   **The Importance of the Date:** The year 1950 is the critical clue. It definitively rules out other major changes to the square, such as the removal of the Pantheon's bell towers, which happened much earlier.\n*   **Agent of Removal:** The action being taken by the \"city administration\" aligns perfectly with a public works project like the removal of a tram line.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the evidence, the unique feature that was present in the Piazza della Rotonda until its removal around 1950 was the circular tram line that looped around the central fountain.\n\n<<<A circular tram line (anello tranviario) that looped around the central fountain.>>>"
