    "This problem requires us to simulate a one-dimensional cellular automaton that follows Rule 110. We start with a single '1' and run the simulation for 20 steps (or generations).\n\n### Step 1: Understanding Rule 110\n\nA one-dimensional cellular automaton evolves a line of cells (each 0 or 1) over discrete time steps. The new state of a cell is determined by its own state and the states of its left and right neighbors. Rule 110 is named after its Wolfram code. The number 110 in binary is **01101110**. This 8-bit number defines the output for the 8 possible 3-cell neighborhoods, in descending order from `111` to `000`.\n\nLet's create a lookup table for the rule:\n\n| Current Neighborhood (Left, Center, Right) | New State of Center Cell |\n|:-------------------------------------------|:---------------------------|\n| `111`                                      | **0**                      |\n| `110`                                      | **1**                      |\n| `101`                                      | **1**                      |\n| `100`                                      | **0**                      |\n| `011`                                      | **1**                      |\n| `010`                                      | **1**                      |\n| `001`                                      | **1**                      |\n| `000`                                      | **0**                      |\n\n### Step 2: Defining the Initial State and Process\n\n*   **Initial State (Generation 0):** A single cell in state 1, surrounded by an infinite grid of 0s. We can represent this simply as the pattern `1`.\n*   **Boundary Conditions:** The cells beyond our pattern are always considered to be 0.\n*   **Process:** For each generation, we will calculate the next pattern. We take the current pattern, pad it with `0`s on both sides (e.g., `00...pattern...00`) and apply the rule to each 3-cell slice to get the new state of the cell below it. The resulting pattern for the next generation is the binary string between (and including) the leftmost and rightmost '1's.\n\n### Step 3: Step-by-Step Simulation\n\nWe apply the rule iteratively for 20 generations. Let's denote the generation `t` pattern as `G(t)`.\n\n*   **G(0):** `1`\n    *   To get G(1), we consider the padded pattern `00100`. The neighborhoods are `001`, `010`, `100`. Their outcomes are `1`, `1`, `0`.\n*   **G(1):** `11`\n    *   Padded: `001100`. Neighborhoods `001`, `011`, `110`, `100`. Outcomes: `1`, `1`, `1`, `0`.\n*   **G(2):** `111`\n    *   Padded: `0011100`. Outcomes: `1`, `1`, `0`, `1`, `0`.\n*   **G(3):** `1101`\n    *   Padded: `00110100`. Outcomes: `1`, `1`, `1`, `1`, `1`, `0`.\n*   **G(4):** `11111`\n    *   Outcomes for the next generation:\n*   **G(5):** `110001`\n*   **G(6):** `1110011`\n*   **G(7):** `11010111`\n*   **G(8):** `111111101`\n*   **G(9):** `1100000111`\n*   **G(10):** `1110001101`\n*   **G(11):** `11010011111`\n*   **G(12):** `111110110001`\n*   **G(13):** `1100011110011`\n*   **G(14):** `11100110010111`\n*   **G(15):** `110101110111101`\n*   **G(16):** `1111111011100111`\n*   **G(17):** `11000001110101101`\n*   **G(18):** `11100011011111111`\n*   **G(19):** `110100111110000001`\n    *   To get G(20), we take the pattern from G(19) and apply the rules.\n    *   Padded pattern: `...001101001111000000100...`\n    *   Applying Rule 110 to each 3-bit window:\n        *   `001` -> 1\n        *   `011` -> 1\n        *   `110` -> 1\n        *   `101` -> 1\n        *   `010` -> 1\n        *   `100` -> 0\n        *   `001` -> 1\n        *   `011` -> 1\n        *   `111` -> 0\n        *   `111` -> 0\n        *   `110` -> 1\n        *   `100` -> 0\n        *   `000` -> 0\n        *   `000` -> 0\n        *   `000` -> 0\n        *   `001` -> 1\n        *   `010` -> 1\n        *   `100` -> 0\n*   **G(20):** Combining these results gives the final pattern.\n\nThe final pattern for generation 20 is `11111011001000011`.\n\n<<<11111011001000011>>>"
