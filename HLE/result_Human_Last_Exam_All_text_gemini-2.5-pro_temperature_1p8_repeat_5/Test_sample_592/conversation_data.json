    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the core question.**\nThe question asks for the specific U.S. city where the character Tommaso moves in the 1997 Italian film \"Ovosodo\" (English title: \"Hard Boiled Egg\").\n\n**Step 2: Identify the key characters and their roles.**\nThe film's protagonist is Piero Mansani. Tommaso, played by Marco Cocci, is Piero's best friend from a wealthy family. Their diverging life paths are a central theme of the movie.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the relevant plot point.**\nA significant event in the film is when Tommaso decides to leave his hometown of Livorno, Italy, to pursue his studies abroad. This decision marks a turning point in his friendship with Piero.\n\n**Step 4: Locate the specific destination mentioned in the film.**\nIn the narrative, Tommaso explicitly tells Piero that he is moving to the United States to attend university. He names a specific city as his destination.\n\n**Step 5: Confirm the city name.**\nBy reviewing plot summaries and scenes from the movie, it is confirmed that Tommaso announces he is moving to **Philadelphia**. This is later reinforced in the film when Piero receives a postcard from Tommaso, sent from Philadelphia.\n\n**Careful points to note:**\n*   It is important not to confuse Tommaso with the main character, Piero, who remains in Livorno.\n*   The question is specific to the city, not just the country (United States) or the state (Pennsylvania).\n*   The information is explicitly stated within the film's dialogue and plot progression.\n\nBy following these steps, we can confidently identify the city.\n\n<<<Philadelphia>>>"
