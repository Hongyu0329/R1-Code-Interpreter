    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the minimal area of a convex domain that intersects all lines with the equation `px + qy = 1`, where `p` and `q` are coprime integers.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Condition**\n\nLet `K` be a convex domain in the plane. Let `L_{p,q}` be the line defined by the equation `px + qy = 1`, where `p` and `q` are coprime integers (i.e., `gcd(p, q) = 1`).\n\nThe condition is that `K` must have a non-empty intersection with every such line `L_{p,q}`.\n`K ∩ L_{p,q} ≠ ∅` for all coprime integers `p` and `q`.\n\nA line `px + qy = 1` divides the plane into two open half-planes: `H_1 = {(x, y) | px + qy > 1}` and `H_2 = {(x, y) | px + qy < 1}`. The condition `K ∩ L_{p,q} ≠ ∅` is equivalent to saying that `K` is not entirely contained in `H_1` and not entirely contained in `H_2`.\n\nThis can be expressed using the support function of `K`, which is `h_K(u,v) = sup{ux + vy | (x, y) ∈ K}`.\nFor `K` not to be in `H_2`, there must be some point `(x, y) ∈ K` such that `px + qy ≥ 1`. This means `sup{px + qy | (x, y) ∈ K} ≥ 1`.\nFor `K` not to be in `H_1`, there must be some point `(x, y) ∈ K` such that `px + qy ≤ 1`. This means `inf{px + qy | (x, y) ∈ K} ≤ 1`.\n\nSo, for all coprime integers `p` and `q`, `K` must satisfy:\n1. `sup_{(x,y)∈K} (px + qy) ≥ 1`\n2. `inf_{(x,y)∈K} (px + qy) ≤ 1`\n\n**Step 2: Derive Constraints on the Size of the Domain**\n\nLet's test the condition for some specific lines in the family. The integers `p` and `q` being coprime is a crucial point.\n\n*   Case 1: `(p, q) = (1, 0)`. `gcd(1, 0) = 1`. The line is `x = 1`.\n    The condition implies `sup(x) ≥ 1` and `inf(x) ≤ 1`.\n*   Case 2: `(p, q) = (-1, 0)`. `gcd(-1, 0) = 1`. The line is `-x = 1` or `x = -1`.\n    The condition implies `sup(-x) ≥ 1` and `inf(-x) ≤ 1`.\n    `sup(-x) = -inf(x)`, so `-inf(x) ≥ 1`, which means `inf(x) ≤ -1`.\n    `inf(-x) = -sup(x)`, so `-sup(x) ≤ 1`, which means `sup(x) ≥ -1`.\n\n    Combining the conditions from `(1,0)` and `(-1,0)`:\n    - `sup(x) ≥ 1`\n    - `inf(x) ≤ -1`\n    The width of the domain `K` in the x-direction is `w_x = sup(x) - inf(x)`. From the above inequalities, `w_x ≥ 1 - (-1) = 2`.\n\n*   Case 3: `(p, q) = (0, 1)`. `gcd(0, 1) = 1`. The line is `y = 1`.\n    The condition implies `sup(y) ≥ 1` and `inf(y) ≤ 1`.\n*   Case 4: `(p, q) = (0, -1)`. `gcd(0, -1) = 1`. The line is `-y = 1` or `y = -1`.\n    The condition implies `sup(-y) ≥ 1`, which means `inf(y) ≤ -1`.\n\n    Combining the conditions from `(0,1)` and `(0,-1)`:\n    - `sup(y) ≥ 1`\n    - `inf(y) ≤ -1`\n    The width of the domain `K` in the y-direction is `w_y = sup(y) - inf(y)`. From the above, `w_y ≥ 1 - (-1) = 2`.\n\n**Step 3: Find a Lower Bound for the Area**\n\nThere is a well-known result in geometry that for any convex set `K`, its area is bounded by its widths in orthogonal directions. For the widths `w_x` and `w_y` parallel to the coordinate axes, the inequality is:\n`Area(K) ≥ (1/2) * w_x * w_y`\n\nUsing the results from Step 2:\n`Area(K) ≥ (1/2) * 2 * 2 = 2`.\nThis means the minimal area of such a convex domain must be at least 2.\n\n**Step 4: Propose a Candidate Domain and Verify**\n\nNow we need to see if we can find a convex domain `K` that satisfies all the conditions and has an area of exactly 2.\n\nConsider the square `D` with vertices at `(1,0), (0,1), (-1,0), (0,-1)`. This is the region defined by `|x| + |y| ≤ 1`.\n*   **Convexity:** This square is a convex set.\n*   **Area:** The diagonals have length 2. The area is half the product of the diagonals: `(1/2) * 2 * 2 = 2`.\n\nNow let's verify if `D` satisfies the intersection condition for all coprime `p, q`.\nWe need to check `inf_D(px + qy) ≤ 1 ≤ sup_D(px + qy)`.\n\nSince `D` is a convex polygon, the supremum and infimum of the linear function `f(x,y) = px + qy` will be achieved at one of its vertices: `(1,0), (0,1), (-1,0), (0,-1)`.\nThe values of `px + qy` at these vertices are `p, q, -p, -q`.\n\n`sup_D(px + qy) = max{p, q, -p, -q} = max{|p|, |q|}`.\n`inf_D(px + qy) = min{p, q, -p, -q} = -max{|p|, |q|}`.\n\nThe condition becomes:\n`-max{|p|, |q|} ≤ 1 ≤ max{|p|, |q|}`.\n\nLet's check the two inequalities:\n1.  `-max{|p|, |q|} ≤ 1`: This is equivalent to `max{|p|, |q|} ≥ -1`, which is always true since `|p|` and `|q|` are non-negative.\n2.  `1 ≤ max{|p|, |q|}`: This is the crucial condition. Since `p` and `q` are coprime integers, they cannot both be zero. `gcd(p,q)=1` implies that at least one of `p` or `q` must be a non-zero integer. Therefore, `|p| ≥ 1` or `|q| ≥ 1`. This means `max{|p|, |q|}` is at least 1. The condition holds.\n\nThe square domain `D = {(x,y) : |x| + |y| ≤ 1}` satisfies all the conditions and has an area of 2.\n\n**Step 5: Conclusion**\n\nWe have shown that any such convex domain must have an area of at least 2. We have also found a specific convex domain that meets all the requirements and has an area of exactly 2.\nTherefore, the minimal area is 2.\n\n<<<2>>>"
