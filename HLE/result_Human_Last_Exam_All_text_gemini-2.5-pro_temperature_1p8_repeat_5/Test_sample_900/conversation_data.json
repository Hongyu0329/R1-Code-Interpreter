    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of pas de Balanchines performed by Svetlana Gileva in the specified performance.\n\n### Step 1: Defining the \"Pas de Balanchine\"\n\nThe first crucial step is to define the ballet movement in question. The \"pas de Balanchine\" is not an officially codified step in the traditional ballet syllabus. It is a colloquial term for a specific, stylized version of a *pas de bourrée* frequently used by choreographer George Balanchine.\n\n*   **Characteristics:** It is a three-step movement, typically executed as:\n    1.  A step back onto pointe or demi-pointe.\n    2.  A small step to the side with the other foot.\n    3.  A step forward, often finishing in a lunge with the back leg extended and the hips pushed forward, creating a dynamic, off-balance line.\n*   **Careful Point:** Since this is not a universally defined term, the analysis requires identifying movements that clearly match this specific back-side-front pattern with the characteristic lunge, as distinct from other types of *pas de bourrée* or three-step movements.\n\n### Step 2: Sourcing and Analyzing the Performance\n\nThe question specifies a particular performance: Svetlana Gileva as the \"Jete Woman\" in William Forsythe's \"In the Middle, Somewhere Elevated\" with Semperoper Ballett in 2015. The analysis is based on video footage of this specific performance. The solo is renowned for its speed and technical difficulty.\n\n### Step 3: Chronological Count of the Movement\n\nBy watching the solo and applying the definition from Step 1, we can count each instance of a pas de Balanchine.\n\n*   **First Instance:** Approximately 22 seconds into the solo, Gileva performs a clear pas de Balanchine. She steps back on her right foot, side with the left, and lunges forward onto the left foot. **(Count: 1)**\n*   **Second Instance:** She immediately repeats the exact same step on the same side. **(Count: 2)**\n*   **Choreographic Break:** Following this initial pair, the choreography moves into a different phrase involving promenades, piqué turns, and other steps.\n*   **Third Instance:** At approximately 34 seconds, she begins a new sequence with another clear pas de Balanchine. She steps back (left foot), side (right foot), and lunges forward onto the left foot. **(Count: 3)**\n*   **Fourth Instance:** She immediately repeats the step. **(Count: 4)**\n*   **Fifth Instance:** A third repetition occurs in the same sequence. **(Count: 5)**\n*   **Sixth Instance:** She performs the step a fourth and final time in this rapid succession before transitioning into a series of grand jetés. **(Count: 6)**\n\n### Step 4: Final Verification\n\nA thorough review of the remainder of the solo confirms that no other movements match the specific three-step \"back-side-lunge\" structure of a pas de Balanchine. The rest of the choreography consists of different steps, including *développés*, *piqués*, *grand jetés*, and complex linking steps unique to Forsythe's style. The six identified movements are clear choreographic quotations of the Balanchine style.\n\n*   **Careful Point:** It is important not to confuse other lunges or three-step traveling movements within the complex choreography for a pas de Balanchine. The count is limited to only those steps that fit the specific definition.\n\nBased on this analysis, Svetlana Gileva performs the pas de Balanchine a total of six times, in two distinct sets (a set of two, and a set of four).\n\n<<<6>>>"
