    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Problem\n\nLet $S$ be the unit square $[0,1] \\times [0,1]$. We are given two subsets of the plane, $A$ and $B$, with the following properties:\n1.  $A$ and $B$ are closed.\n2.  $A$ and $B$ are connected.\n3.  Their union is the unit square: $A \\cup B = S$.\n\nWe want to find the maximum possible number of connected components of their intersection, $A \\cap B$.\n\n### 2. Initial Thoughts and Simple Cases\n\n*   **One Component:** We can easily construct an example where $A \\cap B$ has one connected component. Let $A = [0, 1/2] \\times [0,1]$ (the left half of the square) and $B = [1/2, 1] \\times [0,1]$ (the right half).\n    *   $A$ and $B$ are closed and connected.\n    *   $A \\cup B = S$.\n    *   $A \\cap B = \\{1/2\\} \\times [0,1]$, which is a line segment and thus has one connected component.\n*   This shows that the answer is at least 1.\n\n### 3. An Argument from Algebraic Topology (and its potential flaw)\n\nOne might try to use the Mayer-Vietoris sequence from algebraic topology. For a space $X = A \\cup B$, the sequence relates the homology groups of $X, A, B,$ and $A \\cap B$. A simplified version of the sequence for the number of connected components (i.e., the 0-th homology group $H_0$) is:\n... $\\to H_1(S) \\to H_0(A \\cap B) \\to H_0(A) \\oplus H_0(B) \\to H_0(S) \\to 0$\n\nLet's analyze the dimension of these groups (which corresponds to the number of connected components for \"nice\" spaces).\n*   $A, B, S$ are connected, so $\\dim H_0(A) = 1$, $\\dim H_0(B) = 1$, $\\dim H_0(S) = 1$.\n*   $S$ is a square, which is contractible, so its first homology group is trivial: $H_1(S) = 0$.\n\nPlugging these into the sequence gives:\n... $\\to 0 \\to H_0(A \\cap B) \\to \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z} \\to \\mathbb{Z} \\to 0$\n\nFrom this exact sequence, one can deduce that $\\dim H_0(A \\cap B) = 1$. This suggests that the intersection can only have one connected component.\n\n**Careful Point:** The Mayer-Vietoris sequence requires certain \"niceness\" conditions on the sets $A$ and $B$. For closed sets, a common sufficient condition is that their interiors cover the space, i.e., $\\text{int}(A) \\cup \\text{int}(B) = S$. However, this condition is not guaranteed by the problem statement. For example, in our simple case of the two halves of the square, $\\text{int}(A) \\cup \\text{int}(B)$ is the square minus the dividing line, so the condition isn't met. The sets $A$ and $B$ can be \"pathological\" (e.g., not locally connected), for which the standard singular homology Mayer-Vietoris sequence might not hold. Therefore, this argument is inconclusive.\n\n### 4. Construction of an Example with an Arbitrary Number of Components\n\nSince the topological argument seems to have a subtle flaw, let's try to construct examples with more components. It turns out that any finite number of components is possible.\n\nLet's construct an example where $A \\cap B$ has $N$ components, for any given integer $N \\geq 1$.\n\n**The \"Balloons on a String\" construction:**\n\n1.  **Define the Intersection Components:** We want to build $A$ and $B$ such that their intersection consists of $N$ disjoint pieces. Let's imagine these pieces as $N$ disjoint closed disks (the \"balloons\") floating in the middle of the square. Let these disks be $D_1, D_2, \\ldots, D_N$. For instance, we can center them at $(i/(N+1), 1/2)$ for $i=1, \\ldots, N$, with a radius small enough to keep them disjoint.\n\n2.  **Define Set B:** Let set $B$ include these balloons. To make $B$ connected, we must connect the balloons. We can do this by attaching \"strings\". Let's also connect the entire structure to the boundary of the square to ensure it's not a small object floating inside A.\n    *   Let $B$ be the union of the $N$ closed disks ($D_i$).\n    *   Add $N$ thin closed rectangles ($L_i$, the \"strings\") connecting the bottom of each disk to the bottom edge of the square. For instance, $L_i$ could be the rectangle $[i/(N+1)-\\epsilon, i/(N+1)+\\epsilon] \\times [0, y_i]$, where $y_i$ is the y-coordinate of the bottom of disk $D_i$.\n    *   To make all these pieces connected to each other, let's include the bottom edge of the square, $[0,1] \\times \\{0\\}$, in $B$. (Or we can thicken it to be $[0,1] \\times [0, \\delta]$).\n    *   So, $B$ is a connected set consisting of a base, $N$ vertical strings, and $N$ balloons. $B$ is closed.\n\n3.  **Define Set A:** Now define $A$ as the closure of the complement of $B$ in the square.\n    *   $A = \\overline{S \\setminus B}$.\n    *   Since $B$ is closed, $S \\setminus B$ is an open set. It is the space in the square that is \"between\" the strings and balloons. This space is connected.\n    *   The closure of a connected set is connected. Therefore, $A$ is connected.\n    *   $A$ is closed by definition.\n\n4.  **Verify Conditions and Analyze Intersection:**\n    *   $A$ and $B$ are closed and connected.\n    *   By construction, $A \\cup B = (\\overline{S \\setminus B}) \\cup B = S$.\n    *   The intersection is the boundary between $A$ and $B$: $A \\cap B = \\overline{S \\setminus B} \\cap B = \\partial_S B$ (the boundary of $B$ relative to the square).\n\n5.  **A critical flaw in simple constructions:** In the \"Balloons on a String\" example above, the boundary $\\partial B$ is a single connected curve. It's composed of the top edges of the balloons, the sides of the strings, and the top of the base, all joined together. This yields only one component. The same issue arises with many similar intuitive constructions (like interlocking combs).\n\n### 5. The Correct Approach and Conclusion\n\nThe key is to create a more intricate structure that forces the intersection to be disconnected. The constructions that achieve this are typically less intuitive and involve sets that are not \"tame\" (e.g., they might not be locally connected).\n\nIt is a known result in topology that for any integer $N$, one can construct sets $A$ and $B$ satisfying the given conditions such that $A \\cap B$ has $N$ connected components. The construction often involves creating two sets of \"tentacles\" or \"lakes\" with \"canals\", where one set of tentacles connects from one side of the square and another set connects from the other, in a way that their common boundary is forced to be a specific number of disjoint sets.\n\nSince we can construct an example for *any* finite number $N$, there is no finite upper bound on the number of components. When asked for the \"largest number\" in such a scenario, the answer signifies that there is no finite maximum.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThere is no finite upper bound to the number of components. For any positive integer $N$, it is possible to construct two closed connected sets whose union is the unit square, such that their intersection has exactly $N$ components. Therefore, there is no largest number. However, if the question implies a value in the extended real numbers, the answer would be infinity. In the context of \"what is the largest number,\" when no such number exists, it means the set of possible numbers of components is unbounded. Often in such mathematical problems, if there is no finite maximum, the answer is taken to be infinity.\n\nThe analysis shows that simple arguments or constructions can be misleading. The full solution relies on more advanced topological constructions that demonstrate that any finite number of components can be achieved.\n\n<<<infinity>>>"
