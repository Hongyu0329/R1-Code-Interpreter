    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the solution.\n\n**1. Understand the Problem**\n\nWe are given a polynomial $P(x)$ defined as a product of 20 terms:\n$P(x) = \\prod_{i=0}^{19}\\left( 1+x^{3^i}+x^{2\\cdot 3^i}+ x^{3\\cdot 3^i}\\right)$.\nIf we expand this polynomial into its power series form, $P(x) = \\sum_k a_k x^k$, we need to find the value of $\\sum_k a_k^2$, which is the sum of the squares of its coefficients.\n\n**2. Key Insight: Finding the Sum of Squares of Coefficients**\n\nA direct expansion of $P(x)$ to find each coefficient $a_k$ would be extremely complicated. Instead, we can use a powerful identity related to polynomials.\n\nFor any polynomial $P(x) = \\sum_k a_k x^k$ with real coefficients, the sum of the squares of its coefficients, $\\sum_k a_k^2$, is equal to the constant term of the polynomial product $P(x)P(x^{-1})$.\n\nLet's quickly verify this.\nLet $P(x) = a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2 + \\dots$.\nThen $P(x^{-1}) = a_0 + a_1 x^{-1} + a_2 x^{-2} + \\dots$.\nThe product is $P(x)P(x^{-1}) = (a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2 + \\dots)(a_0 + a_1 x^{-1} + a_2 x^{-2} + \\dots)$.\nTo find the constant term (the term with $x^0$), we multiply terms $a_j x^j$ from $P(x)$ with terms $a_k x^{-k}$ from $P(x^{-1})$ such that the exponents add to zero, which means $j-k=0$ or $j=k$.\nSo, the constant term is the sum of products $a_k x^k \\cdot a_k x^{-k} = a_k^2$.\nThis gives us the sum: Constant Term = $a_0^2 + a_1^2 + a_2^2 + \\dots = \\sum_k a_k^2$.\n\n**3. Applying the Insight to the Given Polynomial**\n\nOur goal is now to find the constant term of $P(x)P(x^{-1})$.\nLet's construct the expression for $P(x)P(x^{-1})$:\n$P(x) = \\prod_{i=0}^{19}\\left( 1+x^{3^i}+x^{2\\cdot 3^i}+ x^{3\\cdot 3^i}\\right)$\n$P(x^{-1}) = \\prod_{i=0}^{19}\\left( 1+(x^{-1})^{3^i}+(x^{-1})^{2\\cdot 3^i}+ (x^{-1})^{3\\cdot 3^i}\\right) = \\prod_{i=0}^{19}\\left( 1+x^{-3^i}+x^{-2\\cdot 3^i}+ x^{-3\\cdot 3^i}\\right)$\n\nThe product is:\n$P(x)P(x^{-1}) = \\left[ \\prod_{i=0}^{19}(\\dots) \\right] \\left[ \\prod_{i=0}^{19}(\\dots) \\right] = \\prod_{i=0}^{19} \\left[ \\left( 1+x^{3^i}+x^{2\\cdot 3^i}+ x^{3\\cdot 3^i}\\right) \\left( 1+x^{-3^i}+x^{-2\\cdot 3^i}+ x^{-3\\cdot 3^i}\\right) \\right]$\n\n**4. Calculating the Constant Term**\n\nThe constant term of a product of polynomials is the product of their individual constant terms. Let's analyze the $i$-th factor in the product above:\nLet $Q_i(x) = \\left( 1+x^{3^i}+x^{2\\cdot 3^i}+ x^{3\\cdot 3^i}\\right) \\left( 1+x^{-3^i}+x^{-2\\cdot 3^i}+ x^{-3\\cdot 3^i}\\right)$.\nTo simplify, let $y_i = x^{3^i}$. The expression becomes:\n$Q_i(x) = (1+y_i+y_i^2+y_i^3)(1+y_i^{-1}+y_i^{-2}+y_i^{-3})$\n\nWe need to find the constant term of this product. This is the sum of all terms whose exponent of $y_i$ is zero. Let's multiply terms from the first factor by terms from the second factor:\n- $1 \\times 1 = 1$\n- $y_i \\times y_i^{-1} = y_i^0 = 1$\n- $y_i^2 \\times y_i^{-2} = y_i^0 = 1$\n- $y_i^3 \\times y_i^{-3} = y_i^0 = 1$\n\nAny other combination of terms will result in a non-zero power of $y_i$ (and thus a non-zero power of $x$). For example, $1 \\times y_i^{-1} = y_i^{-1}$, or $y_i \\times y_i^{-3} = y_i^{-2}$.\nSo, the constant term of $Q_i(x)$ is the sum of the constant products we found: $1+1+1+1 = 4$.\n\nThis holds true for every $i$ from $0$ to $19$.\n\n**5. Final Calculation**\n\nThe constant term of $P(x)P(x^{-1})$ is the product of the constant terms of each $Q_i(x)$ for $i=0, 1, 2, \\dots, 19$.\nConstant Term of $P(x)P(x^{-1}) = \\prod_{i=0}^{19} (\\text{Constant Term of } Q_i(x))$.\nSince the constant term of each $Q_i(x)$ is 4, we have:\nConstant Term = $\\prod_{i=0}^{19} 4$.\nThe number of terms in the product is $19 - 0 + 1 = 20$.\nSo, the final result is $4^{20}$.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWe have established that $\\sum_k a_k^2$ is the constant term of $P(x)P(x^{-1})$, which we calculated to be $4^{20}$.\nTherefore, $\\sum_k a_k^2 = 4^{20}$.\n\nFinal answer can also be written as $(2^2)^{20} = 2^{40}$."
