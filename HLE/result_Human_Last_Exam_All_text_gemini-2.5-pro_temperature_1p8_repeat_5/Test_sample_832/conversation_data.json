    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of entrelacés in Natalia Osipova's debut performance of the \"Death of Nikiya\" variation.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Identify the specific performance and choreographic moment.**\nThe question asks about Natalia Osipova's debut as Nikiya with the Bolshoi Ballet in 2009. We need to focus specifically on her solo variation within the \"Death of Nikiya\" scene, which takes place in the final act of the ballet *La Bayadère*. This variation is performed after Nikiya is given a basket of flowers containing a venomous snake.\n\n**Step 2: Define the ballet step \"entrelacé\".**\nAn *entrelacé*, also commonly known as a *tour jeté*, is a type of turning jump. The dancer throws one leg up (as in a *grand battement*), jumps, and while in the air, makes a half-turn, switching the legs so they land on the leg that was thrown up first. It creates a distinctive \"laced\" or \"braided\" look in the air. For the purpose of this analysis, we will count each individual jump that fits this description.\n\n**Step 3: Locate and observe the performance.**\nA video recording of Natalia Osipova's 2009 debut in this role is available for viewing. By analyzing her solo variation, we can count the specific steps performed.\n\n**Step 4: Count the entrelacés within the variation.**\nThe variation has distinct sections. The entrelacés appear in the fast-paced, allegro section of the dance, which showcases Nikiya's anguish and despair.\n*   Following the slower, more poignant introductory movements, Osipova begins a diagonal travelling sequence across the stage.\n*   This sequence consists entirely of consecutive *entrelacés*.\n*   Carefully counting each jump in this famous sequence, we can observe:\n    1.  First entrelacé\n    2.  Second entrelacé\n    3.  Third entrelacé\n    4.  Fourth entrelacé\n    5.  Fifth entrelacé\n    6.  Sixth entrelacé\n    7.  Seventh entrelacé\n*   She performs a total of seven consecutive entrelacés in this section. After this sequence, the choreography moves on to different steps, such as *fouetté* turns and dramatic poses, with no further entrelacés.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n*   **Correct identification of the step:** It is crucial to distinguish entrelacés from other jumps like *grand jetés* (which do not typically turn in the same way) or *saut de basques*. The key is the mid-air switch of the legs combined with a half-turn.\n*   **Correct Performance:** The count must be based on the specific 2009 debut performance, as choreographic details can sometimes vary slightly between performers or stagings. Osipova's rendition in her debut is noted for this powerful series of seven jumps.\n*   **Completeness:** The analysis must cover the entire solo variation to ensure no other instances of the step are missed. In this standard choreography, the entrelacés are grouped together in one signature sequence.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on a step-by-step analysis of the choreography in the specified performance, Natalia Osipova performs a sequence of seven entrelacés.\n\n<<<7>>>"
