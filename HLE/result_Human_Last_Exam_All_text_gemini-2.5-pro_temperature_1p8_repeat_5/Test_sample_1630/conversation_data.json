    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nWe want to find the maximum number of fixed points for the composite function $f(g(x))$. A fixed point $x_0$ satisfies the equation $f(g(x_0)) = x_0$.\n\n**2. Characterize the Functions**\n*   **$f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are polynomials of degree 3.**\n    Let $f(x) = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d$ and $g(x) = px^3 + qx^2 + rx + s$, with leading coefficients $a \\neq 0$ and $p \\neq 0$.\n*   **The derivatives $f'(x)$ and $g'(x)$ are positive for all $x$.**\n    *   The derivatives are quadratic polynomials: $f'(x) = 3ax^2 + 2bx + c$ and $g'(x) = 3px^2 + 2qx + r$.\n    *   For a quadratic to be always positive, its parabola must open upwards and not intersect the x-axis.\n    *   This imposes two conditions on the coefficients of $f'(x)$:\n        1.  The leading coefficient must be positive: $3a > 0 \\implies a > 0$.\n        2.  The discriminant must be negative: $(2b)^2 - 4(3a)(c) < 0 \\implies 4b^2 - 12ac < 0 \\implies b^2 < 3ac$.\n    *   Similarly, for $g'(x)$:\n        1.  $3p > 0 \\implies p > 0$.\n        2.  $(2q)^2 - 4(3p)(r) < 0 \\implies 4q^2 - 12pr < 0 \\implies q^2 < 3pr$.\n    *   A direct consequence of $f'(x) > 0$ and $g'(x) > 0$ is that both $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are strictly increasing functions for all real $x$.\n\n**3. Formulate the Equation for Fixed Points**\n*   We need to find the maximum number of real solutions to the equation $f(g(x)) = x$.\n*   Let's define a new function $H(x) = f(g(x)) - x$. The fixed points are the roots of $H(x) = 0$.\n\n**4. Determine the Nature of $H(x)$**\n*   Since $f$ and $g$ are polynomials, the composition $f(g(x))$ is also a polynomial.\n*   The degree of $f(g(x))$ is the product of the degrees of $f$ and $g$.\n    degree($f(g(x))$) = degree($f$) × degree($g$) = 3 × 3 = 9.\n*   The function $H(x) = f(g(x)) - x$ is a polynomial of degree 9. The leading term comes from $f(g(x))$, which is $a(px^3)^3 = ap^3x^9$. Since $a>0$ and $p>0$, the leading coefficient $ap^3$ is positive and non-zero.\n*   By the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, a polynomial of degree 9 can have at most 9 real roots. This gives us an upper bound for the number of fixed points. The maximum number of fixed points is at most 9.\n\n**5. Investigate if 9 Fixed Points is Achievable**\nTo determine if 9 distinct real roots are achievable, we can use Rolle's Theorem.\n*   If a function $H(x)$ has 9 distinct real roots, its derivative $H'(x)$ must have at least 8 distinct real roots.\n*   Let's find the derivative of $H(x)$:\n    $H'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(f(g(x)) - x) = f'(g(x)) \\cdot g'(x) - 1$.\n*   The roots of $H'(x)$ are the solutions to the equation $f'(g(x))g'(x) = 1$. Let's call the function on the left side $k(x)$.\n*   $k(x) = f'(g(x))g'(x)$ is a polynomial.\n    *   $f'(g(x))$ has degree $2 \\times 3 = 6$.\n    *   $g'(x)$ has degree 2.\n    *   The degree of $k(x)$ is $6 + 2 = 8$.\n*   So, the equation $H'(x) = 0$ is equivalent to $k(x) - 1 = 0$, which is a polynomial equation of degree 8. This equation can have at most 8 real roots.\n\n**6. Deeper Analysis with the Second Derivative**\nLet's continue applying Rolle's Theorem.\n*   If $H'(x)$ has 8 distinct real roots, its derivative $H''(x)$ must have at least 7 distinct real roots.\n*   Let's find the second derivative of $H(x)$:\n    $H''(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(f'(g(x))g'(x) - 1) = \\frac{d}{dx}k(x)$.\n    Using the product rule and chain rule:\n    $H''(x) = [f''(g(x)) \\cdot g'(x)] \\cdot g'(x) + f'(g(x)) \\cdot g''(x)$\n    $H''(x) = f''(g(x))(g'(x))^2 + f'(g(x))g''(x)$.\n*   Let's determine the degree of $H''(x)$.\n    *   $f''(x) = 6ax + 2b$ (degree 1). So $f''(g(x))$ has degree $1 \\times 3 = 3$.\n    *   $g'(x)$ has degree 2, so $(g'(x))^2$ has degree 4.\n    *   The first term, $f''(g(x))(g'(x))^2$, has degree $3 + 4 = 7$.\n    *   $f'(g(x))$ has degree 6.\n    *   $g''(x) = 6px + 2q$ (degree 1).\n    *   The second term, $f'(g(x))g''(x)$, has degree $6 + 1 = 7$.\n*   The leading coefficient of the first term is $(6ap)(3p)^2 = 54ap^3$.\n*   The leading coefficient of the second term is $(3ap^2)(6p) = 18ap^3$.\n*   The leading coefficient of $H''(x)$ is $54ap^3 + 18ap^3 = 72ap^3$. Since $a>0$ and $p>0$, this coefficient is non-zero.\n*   So, $H''(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 7.\n\n**7. Concluding the Argument**\n1.  The number of fixed points is the number of roots of the degree 9 polynomial $H(x) = f(g(x)) - x$. The maximum possible number is 9.\n2.  We need to verify if this maximum is attainable under the given constraints.\n3.  For $H(x)$ to have 9 distinct roots, its second derivative $H''(x)$ must have at least $9-2=7$ distinct roots.\n4.  We have shown that $H''(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 7. A polynomial of degree 7 can have up to 7 distinct real roots.\n5.  There are no obvious structural contradictions that would prevent $H''(x)$ from having 7 real roots. With the number of free parameters available in the coefficients of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$, it is possible to construct functions $f$ and $g$ that satisfy the positivity conditions for their derivatives, and for which $H''(x)=0$ has 7 distinct real roots.\n6.  If $H''(x)$ has 7 distinct real roots, then $H'(x)$ can have up to 8 distinct real roots, and consequently, $H(x)$ can have up to 9 distinct real roots. We would need to choose the parameters to make the local extrema of $H'(x)$ alternate in sign, and similarly for $H(x)$. This is generally possible for polynomials.\n\nTherefore, the algebraic limit of 9 is achievable.\n\nFinal Answer Check: A special case is when $f(x)=g(x)$. Then the fixed points of $f(f(x))$ are the solutions to $f(x)=x$ (because $f$ is strictly increasing), which is a cubic equation with at most 3 roots. Our problem is more general and allows for more complex interaction between the two functions. The analysis shows no contradictions with the maximum possible number of roots being 9."
