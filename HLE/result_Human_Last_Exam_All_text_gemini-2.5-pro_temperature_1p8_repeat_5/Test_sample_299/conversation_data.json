    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### **Analysis of the Question**\n\nWe are asked to find the cardinality of the set of continuous functions $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ such that $f(f(x)) = e^x$.\n\nLet's denote the equation by $(E): f(f(x)) = e^x$. The function on the right-hand side, $g(x) = e^x$, has some key properties: it's continuous, strictly increasing, and its range is $(0, \\infty)$.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the monotonicity of f**\n\n1.  **Injectivity:** Suppose $f(x_1) = f(x_2)$. Applying $f$ to both sides, we get $f(f(x_1)) = f(f(x_2))$. By equation $(E)$, this means $e^{x_1} = e^{x_2}$. Since $e^x$ is injective, it follows that $x_1 = x_2$. Thus, $f$ must be injective.\n2.  **Monotonicity:** A continuous and injective function on $\\mathbb{R}$ must be strictly monotonic. This means $f$ must be either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the case where f is strictly decreasing**\n\nLet's assume $f$ is a strictly decreasing continuous function.\n1.  Since $f$ is strictly decreasing, the composition $f \\circ f$ must be strictly increasing. This is because if $x_1 < x_2$, then $f(x_1) > f(x_2)$, and applying the decreasing function $f$ again reverses the inequality, so $f(f(x_1)) < f(f(x_2))$. The function $e^x$ is strictly increasing, so this is consistent.\n2.  Let $R(f)$ be the range of $f$. Since $f$ is a continuous function on the connected set $\\mathbb{R}$, its range $R(f)$ must be an interval. Let $R(f) = (M, L)$, where $M = \\lim_{x\\to\\infty} f(x)$ and $L = \\lim_{x\\to-\\infty} f(x)$. Since $f$ is decreasing, $M < L$.\n3.  The range of $f \\circ f$ is $f(R(f)) = f((M, L))$. This must be equal to the range of $e^x$, which is $(0, \\infty)$.\n4.  Since $f$ is decreasing on its domain $\\mathbb{R}$, its action on the interval $(M, L)$ (which is a subset of the domain) is to map it to the interval $(\\lim_{y \\to L^-} f(y), \\lim_{y \\to M^+} f(y))$.\n5.  Equating this with $(0, \\infty)$, we get:\n    (a) $\\lim_{y \\to L^-} f(y) = 0$\n    (b) $\\lim_{y \\to M^+} f(y) = \\infty$\n6.  From condition (b), we see that as the input to $f$ approaches $M$ from above, the output of $f$ tends to infinity. For a continuous function $f:\\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$, this can only happen if $M$ is not a real number, so $M = -\\infty$. (If $M$ were real, by continuity, the limit would be $f(M)$, which is a finite real number). So, $\\lim_{x\\to\\infty} f(x) = -\\infty$.\n7.  Let's determine $L$. We know $L = \\lim_{x\\to-\\infty} f(x)$. This means $f$ is surjective onto $(M, L) = (-\\infty, L)$. So for any value $y \\in (-\\infty, L)$, there is an $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$ with $f(x)=y$.\n8.  Now consider the limit $\\lim_{y \\to -\\infty} f(y)$. Since the domain of $f$ is all of $\\mathbb{R}$, this limit is well-defined, and it is equal to $L = \\lim_{x\\to-\\infty} f(x)$. So, $\\lim_{y \\to -\\infty} f(y) = L$.\n9.  Now, let's revisit the range calculation. $f(R(f)) = f((-\\infty, L)) = (\\lim_{y \\to L^-} f(y), \\lim_{y \\to -\\infty} f(y))$. We know this must be $(0, \\infty)$. This implies $\\lim_{y \\to -\\infty} f(y) = \\infty$.\n10. So, we must have $L=\\infty$.\n11. If $L = \\infty$ and $M = -\\infty$, then the range of $f$ is $(-\\infty, \\infty) = \\mathbb{R}$. This means $f$ is a surjective map from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$.\n12. If $f$ is surjective, then $R(f) = \\mathbb{R}$. The range of the composition $f \\circ f$ is $f(R(f)) = f(\\mathbb{R}) = \\mathbb{R}$.\n13. However, the range of $e^x$ is $(0, \\infty)$. This gives a contradiction: $\\mathbb{R} \\neq (0, \\infty)$.\n14. Therefore, our initial assumption must be false. There are no strictly decreasing continuous functions $f$ that satisfy the equation.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the case where f is strictly increasing**\n\nNow, we only need to consider strictly increasing continuous functions $f$.\n1.  Let $R(f) = (a, b)$ where $a = \\lim_{x\\to-\\infty} f(x)$ and $b = \\lim_{x\\to\\infty} f(x)$.\n2.  The range of $f \\circ f$ is $f((a,b)) = (\\lim_{y\\to a^+} f(y), \\lim_{y\\to b^-} f(y))$. This must be $(0, \\infty)$.\n3.  So, $\\lim_{y\\to a^+} f(y) = 0$ and $\\lim_{y\\to b^-} f(y) = \\infty$.\n4.  By continuity of $f$, let's analyze these limits. $b$ cannot be a real number, or $\\lim_{y\\to b^-} f(y) = f(b) \\ne \\infty$. Thus $b = \\infty$, so $\\lim_{x\\to\\infty} f(x) = \\infty$.\n5.  Also by continuity, $\\lim_{y\\to a^+} f(y)=0$ implies $f(a)=0$ (if $a$ is real).\n6.  Let's see if $a$ can be $-\\infty$. If $a=\\lim_{x\\to-\\infty}f(x)=-\\infty$, then $R(f)=\\mathbb{R}$. This would lead to the same contradiction as in the decreasing case ($f(R(f)) = \\mathbb{R} \\ne (0,\\infty)$).\n7.  So, $a$ must be a finite real number. We have $a = \\lim_{x\\to-\\infty} f(x)$. From the property of limits and continuous functions, we have $f(a) = f(\\lim_{x\\to-\\infty} f(x)) = \\lim_{x\\to-\\infty} f(f(x)) = \\lim_{x\\to-\\infty} e^x = 0$. So we must have $f(a)=0$.\n8.  Since $f$ is strictly increasing, and $\\lim_{x\\to-\\infty} f(x) = a$ while $f(a)=0$, it must be that $f(x) < f(a)=0$ for $x<a$. However, the values of $f(x)$ must be approaching $a$. This implies that $a<0$.\n9.  In summary, any strictly increasing solution $f$ must have a unique root $a<0$, such that $\\lim_{x\\to-\\infty} f(x)=a$ and $\\lim_{x\\to\\infty} f(x)=\\infty$.\n\n**Step 4: Count the number of increasing solutions**\n\n1.  For any strictly increasing solution $f$, there is a corresponding value $a<0$. Different values of $a$ lead to different functions, since their limits at $-\\infty$ are different.\n2.  Let's show that for any choice of $a<0$, at least one solution $f$ exists.\n3.  A solution must satisfy $f(e^x) = f(f(f(x))) = e^{f(x)}$, so $f$ commutes with $e^x$. This property is key to constructing solutions.\n4.  The construction of such a function $f$ for a given $a<0$ relies on choosing a continuous, strictly increasing function (a homeomorphism) $h_0$ on a \"starting\" interval, for example from $(-\\infty, a)$ to $(a, 0)$, and then extending it to all of $\\mathbb{R}$ using the relations $f(f(x))=e^x$ and $f(e^x)=e^{f(x)}$.\n5.  Specifically, one defines $f(x) = h_0(x)$ for $x \\in (-\\infty, a)$. Then for $x \\in (a,0)$, we define $f(x) = e^{h_0^{-1}(x)}$. One can continue this process to define $f$ on all of $\\mathbb{R}$.\n6.  For any given $a<0$, we can choose a simple, canonical homeomorphism $h_0$ to construct at least one solution $f_a$. For instance, one could make it linear with respect to some transformation of the intervals to $\\mathbb{R}$.\n7.  Since we can construct a distinct solution $f_a$ for each choice of $a \\in (-\\infty, 0)$, there are at least as many solutions as there are numbers in the interval $(-\\infty, 0)$.\n8.  The cardinality of the interval $(-\\infty, 0)$ is the cardinality of the continuum, denoted by $\\mathfrak{c}$ or $2^{\\aleph_0}$. Thus, there are at least $\\mathfrak{c}$ solutions.\n9.  On the other hand, the set of all continuous functions from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$ is determined by the function's values on a dense subset of $\\mathbb{R}$, like the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$. The cardinality of this set is $|\\mathbb{R}|^{|\\mathbb{Q}|} = \\mathfrak{c}^{\\aleph_0} = (2^{\\aleph_0})^{\\aleph_0} = 2^{\\aleph_0 \\cdot \\aleph_0} = 2^{\\aleph_0} = \\mathfrak{c}$.\n10. The set of solutions is a subset of the set of all continuous functions, so its cardinality is at most $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n11. Since the cardinality of the set of solutions is both at least $\\mathfrak{c}$ and at most $\\mathfrak{c}$, it must be exactly $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe set of functions satisfying the given conditions contains only strictly increasing functions. We showed that there is a family of such functions parameterized by a real number $a \\in (-\\infty, 0)$, proving that there are at least $\\mathfrak{c}$ (the cardinality of the continuum) solutions. Since the total number of continuous functions from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$ is also $\\mathfrak{c}$, the cardinality of the solution set must be $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n\nFinal answer is the cardinality of the continuum."
