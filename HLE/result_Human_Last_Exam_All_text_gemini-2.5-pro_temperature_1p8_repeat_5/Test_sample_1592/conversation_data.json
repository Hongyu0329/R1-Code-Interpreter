    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the closest province or territory to Waskaganish, outside of Quebec.\n\n**Step 1: Locate Waskaganish**\nFirst, we need to pinpoint the location of the Waskaganish gathering place. Waskaganish is a Cree community located in the Eeyou Istchee James Bay region of northern Quebec. It is situated on the southeastern shore of James Bay, at the mouth of the Rupert River. Its approximate geographic coordinates are 51.5° N latitude and 78.8° W longitude.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Neighboring Provinces and Territories**\nThe question asks for the closest province or territory *outside of Quebec*. We need to identify the provinces and territories that are geographically near Waskaganish.\n*   **Ontario:** Borders Quebec to the west. The western coast of James Bay is part of Ontario.\n*   **Nunavut:** This territory lies to the north of Quebec. Its closest landmasses to Waskaganish are islands within James Bay and Hudson Bay.\n*   **Newfoundland and Labrador:** Borders Quebec to the east. The land border is far from Waskaganish.\n*   **New Brunswick:** Borders Quebec to the southeast, but is very far from the James Bay region.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Proximity of Each Candidate**\nWe will now evaluate the distance from Waskaganish to the closest point of each potential candidate.\n\n*   **Ontario:** Waskaganish is on the southeastern coast of James Bay. The province of Ontario is located on the opposite (western) side of James Bay. The shortest distance would be a straight line across the southern part of the bay to the Ontario coastline. Visually, on a map, this distance is quite short. The distance from Waskaganish to the Ontario coast is approximately 130 kilometers (about 80 miles).\n\n*   **Nunavut:** The closest part of Nunavut to Waskaganish is Akimiski Island, which is located in the middle of James Bay. While the island is in the same body of water, it is situated to the north-northwest of Waskaganish. The distance from Waskaganish to the southern tip of Akimiski Island is greater than the distance across the bay to Ontario. This distance is roughly 175 kilometers (about 109 miles). Other parts of Nunavut are much farther away.\n\n*   **Newfoundland and Labrador / New Brunswick:** These provinces are hundreds of kilometers to the east and southeast, respectively. They are clearly not the closest.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude the Closest Province or Territory**\nBy comparing the distances, the closest point outside of Quebec to Waskaganish is the coast of Ontario. The distance across the southern part of James Bay to Ontario (~130 km) is shorter than the distance to the nearest part of Nunavut, Akimiski Island (~175 km).\n\nTherefore, Ontario is the closest province to the Waskaganish gathering place.\n\n<<<Ontario>>>"
