    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Reactants and Reaction Type**\n*   **Substrate:** (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane. This is a secondary alkyl halide on a cyclohexane ring.\n*   **Reagent:** Potassium tert-butoxide (KOtBu or t-BuOK). This is a strong, sterically hindered (bulky) base.\n*   **Solvent:** tert-Butyl alcohol (t-BuOH).\nThe reaction of a secondary alkyl halide with a strong base like potassium tert-butoxide strongly favors an **E2 (bimolecular elimination) reaction**.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Stereochemical Requirement for E2 Reactions in Cyclohexanes**\nThe E2 mechanism requires a specific geometry: the leaving group (in this case, the bromo group, -Br) and a hydrogen atom on an adjacent carbon (a β-hydrogen) must be **anti-periplanar**. In a cyclohexane chair conformation, this translates to a **trans-diaxial** arrangement. Both the leaving group and the β-hydrogen must be in axial positions, with one pointing up and the other pointing down.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Structure and Conformations of the Substrate**\n*   **Relative Stereochemistry (cis/trans):** First, we determine if (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane is a *cis* or *trans* isomer.\n    *   For a 1,2-disubstituted cyclohexane, if the absolute configurations at C1 and C2 are opposite (one R, one S), the isomer is **trans**.\n    *   Since we have (1S, 2R), the substrate is **trans-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane**.\n*   **Chair Conformations:** A trans-1,2-disubstituted cyclohexane can exist in two chair conformations: one where both substituents are equatorial (diequatorial) and one where both are axial (diaxial).\n    *   **Conformer A (Diequatorial):** The bromo group is equatorial and the methyl group is equatorial. This is the **more stable** conformer because bulky groups prefer the less sterically crowded equatorial position. The molecule will spend most of its time in this conformation.\n    *   **Conformer B (Diaxial):** The bromo group is axial and the methyl group is axial. This is the **less stable** conformer due to significant 1,3-diaxial steric interactions.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Reactive Conformation**\n*   The E2 reaction requires the leaving group (Br) to be **axial**.\n*   In Conformer A (the major, stable one), the Br is equatorial. An equatorial leaving group cannot undergo E2 elimination because it is not anti-periplanar to any β-hydrogens. Therefore, **Conformer A is unreactive**.\n*   The reaction must proceed through the minor, less stable **Conformer B**, where the Br group is in an axial position. Although this conformer is present in only a small amount at equilibrium, the reaction will pull the equilibrium towards it as the product is formed (Le Châtelier's principle).\n\n**Step 5: Analyze Elimination Pathways from the Reactive (Diaxial) Conformer**\nLet's analyze Conformer B, where both Br and CH₃ are axial. Since they are trans, one must be axial-up and the other axial-down. Let's assume Br is axial-down and the methyl group is axial-up.\n*   **Leaving Group:** Br at C1 is **axial-down**.\n*   **β-Hydrogens:** We need to find a β-hydrogen that is **axial-up**. The β-carbons are C2 and C6.\n    *   **β-Hydrogen at C2 (Zaitsev pathway):** The methyl group at C2 is in the **axial-up** position. Therefore, the hydrogen atom at C2 must be in the **equatorial-down** position. Since this hydrogen is not axial, it cannot be eliminated via the E2 mechanism. Formation of 1-methylcyclohexene (the more substituted Zaitsev product) is **stereochemically forbidden**.\n    *   **β-Hydrogen at C6 (Hofmann pathway):** The carbon at C6 has two hydrogens. One is axial-up and one is equatorial-down. The **axial-up** hydrogen at C6 is perfectly positioned (trans-diaxial) to the axial-down Br at C1.\n*   **Conclusion:** The base (tert-butoxide) can only abstract the axial hydrogen from C6.\n\n**Step 6: Determine the Final Product**\n*   The elimination occurs by removing the H from C6 and the Br from C1.\n*   This forms a double bond between carbon C1 and carbon C6.\n*   The methyl group at C2 is unaffected.\n*   The resulting alkene is **3-methylcyclohexene**.\n    *   Numbering according to IUPAC rules starts from the double bond, giving the methyl group the lowest possible number, which is 3.\n\nSummary: The stereochemistry of the starting material forces the reaction to proceed through a specific pathway. Even though a more substituted alkene (1-methylcyclohexene) could theoretically form, the required geometry for its formation does not exist. Therefore, only the less substituted alkene (3-methylcyclohexene) is formed.\n\n<<<3-methylcyclohexene>>>"
