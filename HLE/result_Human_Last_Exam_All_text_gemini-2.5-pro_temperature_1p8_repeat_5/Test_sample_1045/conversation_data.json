    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of contracted Gaussian functions for toluene using the 6-31G basis set.\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the molecular formula and atom count.**\n\n*   The molecule is toluene.\n*   The chemical formula for toluene is **C7H8**.\n*   This means the molecule consists of:\n    *   7 Carbon (C) atoms\n    *   8 Hydrogen (H) atoms\n\n### **Step 2: Understand the 6-31G basis set notation for each type of atom.**\n\nThe notation \"6-31G\" tells us how many contracted Gaussian functions (CGFs), also known as basis functions, are used to describe the atomic orbitals of each atom. We need to analyze it separately for heavy atoms (Carbon) and hydrogen atoms.\n\n**A) For a Carbon (C) atom (a second-row element):**\n\n*   **Core Orbitals (1s):** The number `6` before the hyphen indicates that the core 1s orbital is described by a single CGF. This single CGF is formed by a fixed linear combination (contraction) of 6 primitive Gaussian functions.\n    *   Core CGFs = **1**\n\n*   **Valence Orbitals (2s and 2p):** The numbers `31` after the hyphen describe the valence shell. This is a \"split-valence\" or \"double-zeta valence\" basis set, meaning the valence orbitals are represented by two sets of functions for greater flexibility.\n    *   **Inner Valence:** The `3` represents the first set of valence functions (the \"inner\" part). For a carbon atom, this includes one s-type function and a set of p-type functions (px, py, pz).\n        *   1 s-function + 3 p-functions = **4** CGFs\n    *   **Outer Valence:** The `1` represents the second set of valence functions (the \"outer\" part). This also includes one s-type function and a set of p-type functions.\n        *   1 s-function + 3 p-functions = **4** CGFs\n\n*   **Total CGFs per Carbon atom:** 1 (core) + 4 (inner valence) + 4 (outer valence) = **9 CGFs**.\n\n**B) For a Hydrogen (H) atom:**\n\n*   Hydrogen only has a valence 1s orbital and no core electrons. The notation `31` applies directly to this valence orbital.\n    *   **Inner Valence:** The `3` means the 1s orbital is represented by one CGF.\n        *   Inner CGF = **1**\n    *   **Outer Valence:** The `1` means the 1s orbital is also represented by a second, more diffuse CGF.\n        *   Outer CGF = **1**\n\n*   **Total CGFs per Hydrogen atom:** 1 (inner) + 1 (outer) = **2 CGFs**.\n\n### **Step 3: Calculate the total number of contracted Gaussian functions for the entire molecule.**\n\nNow, we multiply the number of CGFs per atom by the number of atoms of that type in toluene (C7H8) and sum the results.\n\n*   **Contribution from Carbon:**\n    *   7 Carbon atoms × 9 CGFs/atom = **63 CGFs**\n\n*   **Contribution from Hydrogen:**\n    *   8 Hydrogen atoms × 2 CGFs/atom = **16 CGFs**\n\n*   **Total CGFs for Toluene:**\n    *   63 (from C) + 16 (from H) = **79 CGFs**\n\n### **Careful Points:**\n\n1.  **CGF vs. PGF:** The question asks for *contracted* Gaussian functions (CGFs), which are the basis functions used in the calculation, not the underlying *primitive* Gaussian functions (PGFs).\n2.  **Atom Count:** Be sure to use the correct chemical formula for toluene (C7H8), not benzene (C6H6).\n3.  **Basis Set Interpretation:** Correctly parsing the `X-YZG` notation is critical. `X` applies to core orbitals, while `Y` and `Z` apply to the valence shell. For second-row atoms, a \"valence shell\" includes both s and p orbitals.\n4.  **No Polarization/Diffuse Functions:** The basis set is 6-31G, not 6-31G* or 6-31+G. The `*` (polarization) or `+` (diffuse) symbols would add more functions. Their absence simplifies the calculation.\n\n<<<79>>>"
