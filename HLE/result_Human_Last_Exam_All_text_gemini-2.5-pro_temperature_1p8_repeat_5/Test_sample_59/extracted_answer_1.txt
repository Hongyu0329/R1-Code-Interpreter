The probability is given by the expression $\int_{\mathcal{W}} \left( \int_0^1 \int_0^1 f(u,v) \,du \,dv \right) \,dF(f)$, where $f$ is the random graphon function drawn from the distribution $F$ over the space of graphons $\mathcal{W}$, and $u,v$ are variables of integration over the uniform measure on $[0,1]$. This can also be written as $E_{f \sim F}[E_{\xi_i, \xi_j \sim U}[f(\xi_i, \xi_j)]]$.
