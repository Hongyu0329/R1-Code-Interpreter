    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Question:** The goal is to find the character in William Morris's *The House of the Wolfings* who fulfills three specific criteria:\n    *   They must have visited a Roman city.\n    *   They must describe Roman religious practices.\n    *   The description must contain a clear allusion to the myth of Romulus and Remus (twins suckled by a she-wolf).\n\n2.  **Evaluate Potential Characters:**\n    *   **Thiodolf:** The war-leader of the Wolfings. His story is focused on his leadership, his divine heritage (through the Hall-Sun), and the choice he must make regarding a magical hauberk. He is a leader of the Goths, and there is no indication he has spent time inside a Roman city.\n    *   **The Hall-Sun:** A supernatural, valkyrie-like figure. Her knowledge is mystical and ancient, tied to the gods and fate of the Goths, not based on tourism in Roman cities.\n    *   **Typical Wolfing Tribesmen:** Most of the Goths are depicted as living within their own forested territory (the \"Mirkwood\"). They know the Romans only as an approaching enemy, not through direct experience with their cities and culture.\n    *   **Otter:** A thrall (a bondsman or slave) of the Wolfings. He is explicitly characterized as someone who has traveled widely *before* coming to live with the Wolfings. He has been in the lands of the Romans (whom the Goths call \"the Welsh\") and has seen their cities. This makes him the most logical candidate.\n\n3.  **Locate the Relevant Scene:** The key scene occurs in Chapter IV, \"The Folk-Mote of the Wolfings.\" In this chapter, the tribe gathers to discuss the threat of the approaching Roman army. To better understand their foe, they ask Otter to speak about his experiences among them.\n\n4.  **Analyze Otter's Testimony:** When called upon to speak, Otter describes the Romans and their cities. He tells the assembly that he has been in their towns and has seen their temples (\"God-houses\"). He then describes a specific image or idol he saw that the Romans hold sacred.\n\n5.  **Examine the Specific Description:** Otter describes the Roman religious artifact as an image of **\"a she-wolf lying down and giving suck to two man-children.\"** He further explains that the Romans claim these two children grew up to found the first and greatest of the Roman cities.\n\n6.  **Connect to Roman Mythology:** This description is an unambiguous reference to the foundation myth of Rome. The twin brothers, Romulus and Remus, were said to have been abandoned as infants and were discovered and suckled by a she-wolf (Lupa). They later founded the city of Rome. Otter's description, relayed from the perspective of an outsider who finds the custom strange, is designed for the reader to immediately recognize the famous Roman legend.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe character who visited a Roman city and describes seeing a sacred image of a she-wolf suckling two infant boys is Otter, the thrall.\n\n<<<Otter>>>"
