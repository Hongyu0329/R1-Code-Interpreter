    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the *Iliad* after Mount Olympus.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Task:** The goal is to find the second-tallest mountain explicitly named in the *Iliad*. Mount Olympus, the tallest, must be excluded from the final answer.\n\n2.  **List the Mountains Mentioned in the *Iliad***: We need to compile a list of all mountains and significant peaks that are named in Homer's epic.\n    *   **Mount Olympus:** The home of the gods, mentioned frequently. It is the tallest mountain in Greece.\n    *   **Mount Ida:** Located near Troy, this is a key setting in the epic. Zeus and other gods often watch the Trojan War from its peaks, particularly its highest summit, Gargarus.\n    *   **Mount Athos:** Hera passes over this mountain on her journey from Olympus to Ida in Book 14.\n    *   **Samothrace:** Poseidon sits on the highest peak of this island to watch the battle in Book 13. The peak is known today as Mount Saos or Fengari.\n    *   **Mount Tmolus:** Mentioned in the \"Catalogue of Ships\" (Book 2) as the snowy mountain range in Lydia from which the Maeonian forces came.\n    *   **Mount Pelion:** This mountain is mentioned as the source of the wood for Achilles' famous spear, which was cut from its peak.\n\n3.  **Find the Modern Elevations:** Next, we find the official height of the modern equivalents of these mountains.\n    *   **Mount Olympus:** 2,918 meters (9,573 feet) - This is our baseline, but it is excluded from the final answer.\n    *   **Mount Tmolus (modern Bozdağ, Turkey):** 2,159 meters (7,083 feet).\n    *   **Mount Athos (Greece):** 2,033 meters (6,670 feet).\n    *   **Mount Ida (modern Kaz Dağı, Turkey):** 1,774 meters (5,820 feet).\n    *   **Mount Pelion (Greece):** 1,624 meters (5,328 feet).\n    *   **Samothrace (Mount Saos/Fengari, Greece):** 1,611 meters (5,285 feet).\n\n4.  **Compare the Heights and Determine the Tallest (excluding Olympus):** Now, we rank the mountains from the previous step by height.\n    1.  Mount Tmolus: 2,159 m\n    2.  Mount Athos: 2,033 m\n    3.  Mount Ida: 1,774 m\n    4.  Mount Pelion: 1,624 m\n    5.  Samothrace: 1,611 m\n\n    Comparing the elevations, Mount Tmolus is the tallest among this group.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Explicit Mention:** The analysis only includes mountains that are explicitly named in the *Iliad*. For example, Mount Ossa, often mythologically linked with Mount Pelion, is not mentioned by name in the epic and is therefore not included in the list.\n*   **Correct \"Mount Ida\":** Greek mythology features two famous Mount Idas. The one relevant to the *Iliad* is in the Troad (modern Turkey), not the one on Crete where Zeus was said to be raised. The elevation for the correct Ida has been used.\n*   **Exclusion of Olympus:** The question specifically asks for the tallest mountain *after* Mount Olympus, so it was used only as a point of reference and correctly excluded from the final comparison.\n*   **Historical Accuracy:** The elevations used are the modern, surveyed heights of the mountains, which are the standard measures for their historical counterparts.\n\n### Final Answer\nBased on the analysis, the tallest mountain mentioned in the *Iliad* after Mount Olympus is Mount Tmolus.\n\n<<<Mount Tmolus>>>"
