    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The core of the question is to identify a \"particular conceptual entity.\" We are given several clues about this entity:\n    *   It was discussed by the historian Fernand Braudel.\n    *   Braudel was quoting the writer Paul Morand.\n    *   The assertion is that this entity \"should be inscribed within a sphere.\"\n    *   The symbol of a \"nation\" is given as an *example* of a component or aspect related to this entity.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Clues:**\n    *   **Fernand Braudel:** Braudel is a historian famous for his focus on the *longue dur√©e* (long term) and for analyzing history on a vast, almost planetary scale. His primary units of analysis were often larger than nations or states. He looked at large-scale systems like \"world-economies\" and broad cultural zones.\n    *   **\"Inscribed within a sphere\":** This is a powerful metaphor. A sphere is a complete, self-contained, three-dimensional shape. To inscribe something within it means that the entity should be understood as a whole, a world unto itself, with its own internal logic and connections, yet existing within the larger globe of human history.\n    *   **\"Exemplified by the symbol of a nation\":** This is a crucial point. The entity we are looking for is *not* a nation. Rather, a nation is a component, a part, or a specific manifestation *within* this larger entity. The question asks for the container, not the thing contained.\n\n3.  **Synthesize the Clues and Locate the Source:**\n    *   Considering Braudel's work, the conceptual entity that is larger than a nation and forms a kind of self-contained \"world\" is a **civilization**. This was a central theme in his book *A History of Civilizations* (also known as *Grammar of Civilizations*).\n    *   A search for the specific quote confirms this. In the preface to *A History of Civilizations*, Braudel writes: \"I subscribe entirely to this remark by Paul Morand... In order to get to know oneself, one has to get to know the 'other'.\" He then continues with the direct quote mentioned in the prompt: \"**A civilization should, as Paul Morand says, 'be inscribed within a sphere whose surface contains everything it needs.'**\"\n    *   This passage directly names the conceptual entity.\n\n4.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    *   The quote from Paul Morand, as used by Fernand Braudel, explicitly identifies the entity in question.\n    *   The entity is \"civilization.\"\n    *   A nation is just one component or expression that exists within the much larger and more comprehensive sphere of a civilization. For example, the nations of France, Italy, and Germany can all be considered part of the broader entity of Western Civilization.\n\nThus, the conceptual entity that should be inscribed within a sphere is a civilization.\n\n<<<Civilization>>>"
