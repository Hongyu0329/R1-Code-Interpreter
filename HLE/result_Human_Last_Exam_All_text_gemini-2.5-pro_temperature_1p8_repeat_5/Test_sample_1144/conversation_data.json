    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the ratio of the uncertainty of an electron's momentum to its momentum in the first Bohr orbit.\n\n### Analysis of the Question\nThe problem asks for a specific ratio: $(\\frac{\\text{Uncertainty in momentum}}{\\text{Momentum}})$, which can be written as $\\frac{\\Delta p}{p}$.\nWe are given two key pieces of information:\n1.  The electron is in the **first Bohr orbit** ($n=1$).\n2.  The uncertainty in the electron's position is $\\Delta x = 10 \\text{ pm}$.\n\nTo solve this, we need to combine concepts from two different areas of quantum physics: Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle and the Bohr model of the atom.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n1.  **Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle:** This principle relates the uncertainty in a particle's position ($\\Delta x$) to the uncertainty in its momentum ($\\Delta p$). The mathematical relationship is $\\Delta x \\cdot \\Delta p \\ge \\frac{h}{4\\pi}$, where $h$ is Planck's constant. For calculation purposes, we use the minimum uncertainty case: $\\Delta x \\cdot \\Delta p = \\frac{h}{4\\pi}$.\n2.  **Bohr's Model:** This model describes the momentum ($p$) of an electron in a specific orbit. According to Bohr's quantization condition, the angular momentum ($L$) of an electron is quantized: $L = mvr = n \\frac{h}{2\\pi}$, where $n$ is the principal quantum number.\n3.  **Constants:**\n    *   Planck's Constant, $h = 6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\text{ J} \\cdot \\text{s}$.\n    *   Radius of the first Bohr orbit (Bohr radius), $a_0 = 52.9 \\text{ pm}$ or $5.29 \\times 10^{-11} \\text{ m}$.\n4.  **Unit Conversion:** The position uncertainty is given in picometers (pm). We must ensure all units are consistent. Since the Bohr radius is also conveniently expressed in pm, we can perform the final calculation using pm. ($1 \\text{ pm} = 10^{-12} \\text{ m}$).\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Find the uncertainty in momentum ($\\Delta p$).**\nWe use Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle:\n$\\Delta x \\cdot \\Delta p = \\frac{h}{4\\pi}$\n\nRearranging for $\\Delta p$:\n$\\Delta p = \\frac{h}{4\\pi \\Delta x}$\n\n**Step 2: Find the momentum ($p$) of the electron in the first Bohr orbit.**\nFrom Bohr's model, the angular momentum for the first orbit ($n=1$) is:\n$L = mvr = (1) \\frac{h}{2\\pi}$\n\nSince linear momentum is $p = mv$, we can write this as:\n$p \\cdot r_1 = \\frac{h}{2\\pi}$\nHere, $r_1$ is the radius of the first Bohr orbit, which is the Bohr radius, $a_0$.\n$r_1 = a_0 = 52.9 \\text{ pm}$.\n\nSo, the momentum $p$ is:\n$p = \\frac{h}{2\\pi r_1} = \\frac{h}{2\\pi a_0}$\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the ratio $\\frac{\\Delta p}{p}$.**\nNow we can substitute the expressions for $\\Delta p$ and $p$ into the ratio:\n\n$\\frac{\\Delta p}{p} = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{h}{4\\pi \\Delta x}\\right)}{\\left(\\frac{h}{2\\pi a_0}\\right)}$\n\nTo simplify this fraction, we multiply the numerator by the reciprocal of the denominator:\n\n$\\frac{\\Delta p}{p} = \\left(\\frac{h}{4\\pi \\Delta x}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{2\\pi a_0}{h}\\right)$\n\nWe can cancel out common terms ($h$ and $\\pi$) from the numerator and denominator:\n\n$\\frac{\\Delta p}{p} = \\frac{2 a_0}{4 \\Delta x} = \\frac{a_0}{2 \\Delta x}$\n\nThis simplified formula shows that the ratio depends only on the Bohr radius and the given position uncertainty.\n\n**Step 4: Substitute the numerical values.**\nWe are given:\n*   $\\Delta x = 10 \\text{ pm}$\nThe constant value for the first Bohr orbit radius is:\n*   $a_0 = 52.9 \\text{ pm}$\n\nNow, we plug these values into our simplified formula:\n\n$\\frac{\\Delta p}{p} = \\frac{52.9 \\text{ pm}}{2 \\times 10 \\text{ pm}} = \\frac{52.9}{20}$\n\n$\\frac{\\Delta p}{p} = 2.645$\n\nThe ratio is a dimensionless quantity.\n\n<<<2.645>>>"
