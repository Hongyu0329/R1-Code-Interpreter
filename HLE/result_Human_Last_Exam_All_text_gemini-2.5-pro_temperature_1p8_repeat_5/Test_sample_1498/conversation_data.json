    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the precise location of the prophets' names in the poem 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Understanding the Question:** The request asks to identify the specific range of verses (*abyāt*), from a starting verse to an ending verse, within the poem 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam where the author, Sayyid Ahmad al-Marzuqi, lists the names of the 25 prophets that every Muslim is obliged to know.\n\n2.  **Context of the Poem:** 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam' (The Creed of the Laymen) is a short, didactic poem of 57 verses that outlines the essential tenets of Islamic belief according to the Ash'ari school of theology. It is structured to be easily memorized. The section on prophets comes after the section on the attributes of Allah.\n\n3.  **Locating the Relevant Section:** To find the names, we must first locate the section dedicated to Prophethood (*Nubuwwāt*). Within this section, the poem first mentions the general attributes of prophets (truthfulness, trustworthiness, conveying the message, and intelligence). Immediately after this, it details the specific prophets whose names must be known.\n\n4.  **Identifying the Prelude Verse (The Verse Before the List):** Before starting the list of names, the author clearly states the number of prophets that will be detailed. This occurs in *Bayt* (verse) 35. This verse acts as an introduction to the list but does not contain any names itself.\n    *   **Bayt 35:** تَفْصِيْلُ خَمْسَةٍ وَعِشْرِيْنَ لَزِمْ ٭ كُلَّ مُكَلَّفٍ فَحَقِّقْ وَاغْتَنِمْ\n    *   *Translation:* The details of twenty-five are binding upon every legally responsible person, so verify and seize this opportunity.\n\n5.  **Identifying the Starting Verse of the List:** The actual enumeration of the prophets' names begins in the very next verse.\n    *   **Bayt 36:** فَهُمْ آدَمٌ اِدْرِيْسُ نُوْحٌ هُوْدٌ مَعْ ٭ صَالِحٍ وَإِبْرَاهِيْمُ كُلٌّ مُتَّبَعْ\n    *   *Translation:* They are Adam, Idris, Nuh, Hud, along with Salih and Ibrahim; each is to be followed.\n    *   This is the **starting point** of the list.\n\n6.  **Identifying the Ending Verse of the List:** We continue reading the subsequent verses until the list of 25 prophets is completed. The list concludes four verses later.\n    *   **Bayt 39:** إلْيَاسُ يُوْنُسُ زَكَرِيَّا يَحْيَى ٭ عِيْسَى وَطَهَ خَاتِمٌ دَعْ غَيَّا\n    *   *Translation:* Ilyas, Yunus, Zakariyya, Yahya, 'Isa, and Taha (Prophet Muhammad), the Seal; so abandon misguidance.\n    *   This verse names the last prophets on the list, culminating with Prophet Muhammad ﷺ, who is referred to as 'Taha' and the 'Seal of the Prophets' (*Khātim*). This is the **ending point** of the list.\n\n7.  **Final Confirmation:** The verses from 36 to 39 list all 25 prophets:\n    *   Verse 36: Adam, Idris, Nuh, Hud, Salih, Ibrahim (6)\n    *   Verse 37: Lut, Isma'il, Ishaq, Ya'qub, Yusuf, Ayyub (6)\n    *   Verse 38: Shu'ayb, Harun, Musa, al-Yasa', Dhu al-Kifl, Dawud, Sulayman (7)\n    *   Verse 39: Ilyas, Yunus, Zakariyya, Yahya, 'Isa, Muhammad (6)\n    *   Total = 25 prophets. This confirms the range is correct.\n\n### **Careful Points to Note**\n\n*   **Verse Numbering:** The numbering of verses (35, 36, 39, etc.) is based on the standard and most widely circulated editions of the poem. While minor variations might exist in some manuscripts, the sequence and content of the verses remain consistent.\n*   **Prelude vs. List:** It is important to distinguish between the verse that introduces the count (Bayt 35) and the verses that actually list the names (starting from Bayt 36). The question specifically asks for where the *names* are mentioned.\n*   **Name of Prophet Muhammad ﷺ:** In the final verse of the list (Bayt 39), Prophet Muhammad ﷺ is referred to by the title/name 'Taha' (طه), a common honorific used for him. His status as the final prophet is also affirmed with the word 'Khātim' (Seal).\n*   **The Scope of the Poem:** This list contains the 25 prophets mentioned by name in the Qur'an whose prophethood is explicitly confirmed. The poem clarifies that this specific number is what is considered obligatory knowledge for every accountable Muslim.\n\n### **Conclusion of Analysis**\n\nThe step-by-step analysis of the poem's text confirms that the listing of the 25 prophets' names starts at Bayt 36 and concludes at Bayt 39.\n\n<<<From bayt 36 to bayt 39.>>>"
