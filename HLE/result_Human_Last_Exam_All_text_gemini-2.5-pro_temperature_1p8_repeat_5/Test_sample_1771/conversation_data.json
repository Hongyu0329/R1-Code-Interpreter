    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the historical linguistic development of the Proto-Indo-European verb *seh₂gieti.\n\n### **Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n1.  **PIE Form Breakdown:** The form *seh₂gieti needs to be segmented into its core components: the root (*seh₂g-), the present tense suffix (*-ie-), and the third-person singular ending (*-ti).\n2.  **Laryngeals:** The *h₂ laryngeal must be handled correctly. It doesn't survive into Germanic, but first, it colors the adjacent *e to an *a, and upon its loss, it lengthens the vowel. Thus, *seh₂g- > *sāg-.\n3.  **Grimm's Law:** This is the primary sound shift affecting consonants from PIE to Proto-Germanic. Here, the voiced velar stop *g will be affected.\n4.  **Verner's Law:** This is a crucial exception to Grimm's Law, conditioned by the position of the original PIE accent. It is important to determine if the accent precedes the consonant in question to see if Verner's Law applies. In this case, the accent on thematic verbs like *séh₂gieti is on the root, so Verner's Law does not apply to the *g.\n5.  **Germanic Verb Classes:** The PIE suffix *-ie- typically forms weak class I verbs in Germanic, which have a *-ja- stem. This *-j- is critical as it triggers i-umlaut (i-mutation) in the North and West Germanic languages.\n6.  **I-Umlaut:** The presence of the *-j-* (or an *-i-* in an ending) causes the back root vowel to shift to a front vowel. The result of this fronting is different in each daughter language (Old Norse, Old English, Old High German).\n7.  **Language-Specific Sound Changes:** Beyond the common Germanic changes, each branch has its own unique developments:\n    *   **Old English:** Palatalization of velar consonants (*k, *g) before front vowels.\n    *   **Old High German:** The Second (or High German) Consonant Shift, which affects stops, and the OHG Diphthongization of long vowels.\n8.  **Endings:** The original PIE verbal endings are systematically altered in Proto-Germanic and then further simplified or changed in each daughter language.\n\n---\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n**Step 1: From Proto-Indo-European (PIE) to Proto-Germanic (PGmc)**\n\n1.  **PIE Form:** `*seh₂gieti`\n2.  **Laryngeal effect:** The *h₂ colors the *e and lengthens it, giving PIE `*sāgieti`.\n3.  **Vowel change:** PIE long *ā becomes PGmc long *ō. The root becomes `*sōg-`.\n4.  **Grimm's Law:** The voiced stop PIE *g becomes the voiceless stop PGmc *k. The root is now `*sōk-`.\n5.  **Stem & Ending:** The PIE present suffix *-ie- leads to a PGmc weak class I verb with a stem `*sōkja-`. The PIE third-person singular ending *-ti becomes PGmc `*-iþ`.\n6.  **Proto-Germanic Form:** The stem `*sōkja-` combines with the ending to form the third-person singular present indicative. The full form is **\\*sōkiþ**. The infinitive would be `*sōkjaną` (\"to seek\").\n\n**Step 2: From Proto-Germanic to Old Norse (ON)**\n\n1.  **PGmc Base:** `*sōkiþ`, from the stem `*sōkja-`.\n2.  **i-Umlaut:** The `*-j-` in the stem causes the root vowel `*ō` (spelled `ó` in ON) to front to `œ` ([øː]). So, the stem `sōk-` becomes `sœk-`.\n3.  **Ending Change:** The PGmc ending `*-iþ` regularly becomes `-ir` in the Old Norse third-person singular present.\n4.  **Old Norse Form:** Combining the umlauted stem `sœk-` and the ending `-ir` gives **sœkir**.\n\n**Step 3: From Proto-Germanic to Old English (OE)**\n\n1.  **PGmc Base:** `*sōkiþ`, from the stem `*sōkja-`.\n2.  **i-Umlaut:** The `*-j-` causes the root vowel `*ō` to front to `*ē`. The stem `sōk-` becomes `sēc-` ([seːtʃ-]).\n3.  **Palatalization:** The velar `*k` follows the new front vowel `ē`. This environment causes the consonant to palatalize into the affricate `[tʃ]`, spelled `ċ` or `c`. The stem is thus `sēċ-`.\n4.  **Ending Change:** The PGmc ending `*-iþ` becomes `-eþ` in Old English.\n5.  **Old English Form:** Combining the palatalized stem `sēċ-` and the ending `-eþ` gives **sēċeþ**.\n\n**Step 4: From Proto-Germanic to Old High German (OHG)**\n\n1.  **PGmc Base:** `*sōkiþ`, from the stem `*sōkja-`.\n2.  **OHG Diphthongization:** The PGmc vowel `*ō` becomes the diphthong `uo` in Old High German. The root becomes `*suok-`.\n3.  **Second Consonant Shift:** The PGmc stop `*k` shifts. When following a vowel, it becomes the long voiceless fricative `[xx]`, spelled `hh`. The stem is now `suohh-`.\n4.  **i-Umlaut & Ending:** The `*-j-` from the original stem would phonologically cause i-umlaut, turning `uo` into `üe`. However, this change was often not represented in OHG spelling for this particular diphthong. The PGmc ending `*-iþ` becomes `-it`.\n5.  **Old High German Form:** Combining the shifted stem `suohh-` with the ending `-it` gives the commonly attested form **suohhit**.\n\n### **Final Answer:**\n\n*   **Proto-Germanic:** *sōkiþ\n*   **Old Norse:** sœkir\n*   **Old English:** sēċeþ\n*   **Old High German:** suohhit\n\n<<<Proto-Germanic: *sōkiþ, Old Norse: sœkir, Old English: sēċeþ, Old High German: suohhit>>>"
