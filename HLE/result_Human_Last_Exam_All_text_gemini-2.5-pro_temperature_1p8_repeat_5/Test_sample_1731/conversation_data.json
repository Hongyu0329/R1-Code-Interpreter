    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the equilibrium values of entropy and mean energy for the Bose case of light quanta (photons) using the principles of large deviation theory.\n\n### **Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n**1. Linking Large Deviation Theory (LDT) and Statistical Mechanics**\n\n*   **Boltzmann-Sanov Theorem and the Principle of Maximum Entropy:** Sanov's theorem in large deviation theory provides the probability for the empirical distribution of a large number of samples to be close to a target distribution $Q$, given that the true underlying distribution is $P$. This probability is approximately $e^{-N D_{KL}(Q||P)}$, where $N$ is the number of samples and $D_{KL}(Q||P)$ is the Kullback-Leibler divergence.\n*   In statistical mechanics, the fundamental assumption (microcanonical ensemble) is that all accessible microstates are equally probable. This corresponds to a uniform prior distribution, $P$. Finding the equilibrium macrostate subject to some constraints (like fixed total energy) is equivalent to finding the distribution $Q$ that minimizes the KL divergence from the uniform prior, subject to those constraints.\n*   Minimizing $D_{KL}(Q||P) = \\sum Q_i \\log(Q_i/P_i)$ with a uniform $P_i=c$ is equivalent to maximizing the Shannon entropy, $S = -k_B \\sum Q_i \\log Q_i$. For a physical system, this becomes maximizing the Boltzmann Entropy $S = k_B \\ln \\Omega$, where $\\Omega$ is the number of microstates corresponding to the macrostate. This is the **Principle of Maximum Entropy**.\n\n*   **Cramer-Chernoff Theorem and Fluctuations:** The Cramer-Chernoff theorem describes the probability of the empirical average of a variable (like energy per particle) deviating from its expected value. It establishes the rate function that governs the exponential decay of this probability. The equilibrium state is the one that minimizes this rate function, making it the most probable state. This framework reinforces that the mean values calculated in the canonical ensemble are the overwhelmingly most probable outcomes.\n\n**2. System Definition and Entropy for a Bose Gas**\n\n*   **System:** We consider a gas of photons (light quanta) in a volume $V$. Photons are bosons. A key property is that their total number is not conserved, which implies their chemical potential is zero ($\\mu=0$).\n*   **Macrostate:** A macrostate is defined by the set of occupation numbers $\\{n_i\\}$, where $n_i$ is the number of photons in the energy level $\\epsilon_i$.\n*   **Entropy:** The number of ways to arrange $n_i$ indistinguishable photons into $g_i$ distinct quantum states (modes or sub-levels) having the same energy $\\epsilon_i$ is given by the combinatorial factor:\n    $\\Omega_i = \\binom{n_i + g_i - 1}{n_i} = \\frac{(n_i + g_i - 1)!}{n_i! (g_i - 1)!}$\n*   The total number of microstates for a given macrostate $\\{n_i\\}$ is $\\Omega = \\prod_i \\Omega_i$. The Boltzmann entropy is $S = k_B \\ln \\Omega$. Using Stirling's approximation ($\\ln x! \\approx x \\ln x - x$) for large numbers, the entropy becomes:\n    $S = k_B \\sum_i \\left[ (n_i + g_i) \\ln(n_i + g_i) - n_i \\ln n_i - g_i \\ln g_i \\right]$\n    This is the expression for entropy we need to maximize to find the equilibrium state.\n\n**3. Maximizing Entropy with Constraints**\n\n*   **Constraint:** The only constraint on the system is the constant average total energy, $U$.\n    $\\sum_i n_i \\epsilon_i = U$\n*   **Method:** We use the method of Lagrange multipliers to maximize $S$ subject to the energy constraint. We define the function $L = \\frac{S}{k_B} - \\beta \\left( \\sum_i n_i \\epsilon_i - U \\right)$, where $\\beta$ is the Lagrange multiplier associated with energy.\n*   **Calculation:** We find the most probable occupation number $n_i$ by setting the derivative to zero: $\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial n_i} = 0$.\n    $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial n_i} \\left[ (n_i + g_i) \\ln(n_i + g_i) - n_i \\ln n_i - g_i \\ln g_i - \\beta n_i \\epsilon_i \\right] = 0$\n    $\\left[ \\ln(n_i + g_i) + 1 \\right] - \\left[ \\ln n_i + 1 \\right] - \\beta \\epsilon_i = 0$\n    $\\ln\\left(\\frac{n_i + g_i}{n_i}\\right) = \\beta \\epsilon_i$\n    $1 + \\frac{g_i}{n_i} = e^{\\beta \\epsilon_i}$\n*   **Result (Equilibrium Distribution):** Solving for $n_i$, we find the equilibrium occupation number, which corresponds to the average value $\\langle n_i \\rangle$ in the thermodynamic limit. This is the celebrated Planck distribution for photons:\n    $\\langle n_i \\rangle = \\frac{g_i}{e^{\\beta \\epsilon_i} - 1}$\n    The Lagrange multiplier is identified with the inverse temperature, $\\beta = \\frac{1}{k_B T}$.\n\n**4. Calculating the Equilibrium Mean Energy**\n\n*   To find the total mean energy $U$, we must sum (integrate) the energy $\\epsilon$ weighted by the number of photons $\\langle n(\\epsilon) \\rangle$ over all possible energies. We need the density of states $g(\\epsilon)$, which tells us how many modes exist per unit energy interval. For photons in a 3D box of volume $V$, including two polarization states, the density of states is:\n    $g(\\epsilon)d\\epsilon = \\frac{8\\pi V}{(hc)^3} \\epsilon^2 d\\epsilon$\n*   The mean energy $U$ is:\n    $U = \\int_0^{\\infty} \\epsilon \\langle n(\\epsilon) \\rangle \\frac{g(\\epsilon)}{\\text{d}\\epsilon} d\\epsilon = \\int_0^{\\infty} \\epsilon \\left( \\frac{1}{e^{\\beta \\epsilon} - 1} \\right) \\left( \\frac{8\\pi V}{(hc)^3} \\epsilon^2 \\right) d\\epsilon$\n    $U = \\frac{8\\pi V}{(hc)^3} \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{\\epsilon^3}{e^{\\beta \\epsilon} - 1} d\\epsilon$\n*   We solve the integral by substitution ($x = \\beta \\epsilon$):\n    $\\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{\\epsilon^3}{e^{\\beta \\epsilon} - 1} d\\epsilon = \\frac{1}{\\beta^4} \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{x^3}{e^x - 1} dx$\n    The definite integral is a standard form related to the Riemann zeta function, with value $\\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{x^3}{e^x - 1} dx = \\frac{\\pi^4}{15}$.\n*   **Final Expression for Mean Energy:**\n    $U = \\frac{8\\pi V}{(hc)^3} \\frac{1}{\\beta^4} \\frac{\\pi^4}{15} = \\frac{8\\pi^5 V}{15(hc)^3 \\beta^4}$\n    Substituting $\\beta = 1/(k_B T)$, we get the Stefan-Boltzmann law for total energy:\n    $U(T) = V \\frac{8\\pi^5 (k_B T)^4}{15(hc)^3}$\n\n**5. Calculating the Equilibrium Entropy**\n\n*   We can find the entropy by substituting the equilibrium distribution back into the entropy formula. A more direct way is using the thermodynamic relation $S = (U - F)/T$, where $F = -k_B T \\ln Z$ is the Helmholtz free energy and $Z$ is the partition function. For non-interacting bosons:\n    $\\ln Z = -\\sum_i g_i \\ln(1 - e^{-\\beta \\epsilon_i})$\n*   Converting the sum to an integral using the density of states:\n    $\\ln Z = - \\int_0^{\\infty} g(\\epsilon) \\ln(1 - e^{-\\beta \\epsilon}) d\\epsilon = - \\frac{8\\pi V}{(hc)^3} \\int_0^{\\infty} \\epsilon^2 \\ln(1 - e^{-\\beta \\epsilon}) d\\epsilon$\n*   Integrating by parts, we find:\n    $\\int_0^{\\infty} \\epsilon^2 \\ln(1 - e^{-\\beta \\epsilon}) d\\epsilon = -\\frac{\\pi^4}{45 \\beta^3}$\n*   Therefore, the log of the partition function is:\n    $\\ln Z = - \\frac{8\\pi V}{(hc)^3} \\left( -\\frac{\\pi^4}{45 \\beta^3} \\right) = \\frac{8\\pi^5 V}{45(hc)^3 \\beta^3}$\n*   Now we calculate the entropy:\n    $S = \\frac{U}{T} - \\frac{F}{T} = \\frac{U}{T} + k_B \\ln Z$\n    $S = \\frac{1}{T} \\left( \\frac{8\\pi^5 V k_B^4 T^4}{15(hc)^3} \\right) + k_B \\left( \\frac{8\\pi^5 V}{45(hc)^3} \\left(\\frac{1}{k_B T}\\right)^3 \\right)$\n    $S = \\frac{8\\pi^5 V k_B^4 T^3}{15(hc)^3} + \\frac{8\\pi^5 V k_B}{45(hc)^3} T^3$\n    $S = \\left(\\frac{1}{15} + \\frac{1}{45}\\right) \\frac{8\\pi^5 V k_B^4 T^3}{(hc)^3} = \\left(\\frac{3+1}{45}\\right) \\frac{8\\pi^5 V k_B^4 T^3}{(hc)^3}$\n*   **Final Expression for Entropy:**\n    $S(T) = \\frac{4}{45} \\frac{8\\pi^5 V k_B^4 T^3}{(hc)^3} = V \\frac{32\\pi^5 k_B^4 T^3}{45(hc)^3}$\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe equilibrium values are functions of the system's volume $V$ and temperature $T$. They are:\n\n*   **Equilibrium Mean Energy (U):**\n    $U(T) = V \\frac{8\\pi^5 (k_B T)^4}{15(hc)^3}$\n\n*   **Equilibrium Entropy (S):**\n    $S(T) = V \\frac{32\\pi^5 k_B^4 T^3}{45(hc)^3}$\n\nwhere $V$ is the volume, $T$ is the temperature, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, $h$ is Planck's constant, and $c$ is the speed of light.\n\n<<<\nMean Energy: $U(T) = V \\frac{8\\pi^5 (k_B T)^4}{15(hc)^3}$\nEntropy: $S(T) = V \\frac{32\\pi^5 k_B^4 T^3}{45(hc)^3}$\n>>>"
