    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The core components of the question are:\n    *   **Company:** Enron\n    *   **Event:** A commercial\n    *   **Year:** 2000\n    *   **Tagline:** \"Ask Why\"\n    *   **Subjects:** Two Nobel laureates\n\n2.  **Initial Research & Context:** The \"Ask Why\" campaign was a major advertising effort by Enron in the years leading up to its infamous collapse. The goal was to rebrand Enron from an energy company to a sophisticated, innovative \"new economy\" company dealing in ideas, bandwidth, and risk management. The commercials featured various \"thought leaders\" to lend credibility to this image. The campaign is now seen as a prime example of Enron's deceptive marketing and hubris.\n\n3.  **Identify the Individuals:** We need to find the specific people featured in these ads who were also Nobel Prize winners (either at the time or later). A search for \"Enron Ask Why commercial cast\" or \"Enron Ask Why Nobel\" reveals the participants.\n\n4.  **Pinpoint the Nobel Laureates:** Among the figures featured in the campaign, two were laureates of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences.\n\n    *   **Laureate 1: Robert C. Merton**\n        *   **Careful Point 1:** Merton won his Nobel Prize in 1997, along with Myron Scholes, for a new method to determine the value of derivatives. He was already a Nobel laureate when he appeared in the Enron commercial in 2000.\n        *   **Careful Point 2 (The \"Infamous\" aspect):** His appearance is considered particularly ironic. His own hedge fund, Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM), which relied heavily on complex financial models similar to those he won the Nobel for, had collapsed spectacularly just two years earlier in 1998, requiring a massive private bailout. His association with Enron, another company that would collapse due to opaque and risky financial engineering, made his endorsement highly infamous in retrospect.\n\n    *   **Laureate 2: Paul Krugman**\n        *   **Careful Point 1:** Paul Krugman appeared in the commercials in 2000, but he did not win his Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences until 2008 for his work on trade theory. Therefore, at the time of the commercial, he was a prominent economist but not yet a Nobel laureate. However, he fits the description of a \"Nobel laureate who was featured\" in the commercial.\n        *   **Careful Point 2 (The \"Infamous\" aspect):** Krugman has since publicly expressed regret for his participation, stating he was naive about the nature of Enron at the time. His later fame as a public intellectual and Nobel winner makes his prior association with the disgraced company notable.\n\n5.  **Final Conclusion:** The two Nobel laureates featured in the Enron \"Ask Why\" commercial series were Robert C. Merton and Paul Krugman.\n\n***\n\n<<<Paul Krugman and Robert C. Merton>>>"
