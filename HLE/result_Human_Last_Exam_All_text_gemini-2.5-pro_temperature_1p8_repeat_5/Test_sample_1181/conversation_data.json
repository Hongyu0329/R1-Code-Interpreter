    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Core Question**\nThe question asks to identify a specific character from Andrei Tarkovsky's 1972 film *Solaris*. This character is distinguished by a particular emotion (shame) linked to a specific memory of Earth (the sound of rustling leaves). This requires knowledge of the film's characters and their specific dialogues or expressed feelings.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Characters**\nLet's consider each character provided in the answer choices and their psychological state throughout the film.\n\n*   **A. Kris Kelvin:** The protagonist. He is haunted by memories of Earth, especially his dacha and his deceased wife, Hari. His dominant emotion is guilt over his past actions concerning Hari. While he is deeply connected to Earthly memories, the specific sentiment of being *ashamed* of his homesickness is not his primary characteristic. His shame is focused on his personal relationship with Hari.\n*   **B. Hari:** The \"visitor\" or \"guest\" created from Kris's memories. She has no authentic memories of Earth herself. Her struggles are existential; she is trying to understand her own nature, her lack of a real past, and her love for Kris. She cannot miss something she has never truly experienced.\n*   **C. Snaut:** A cyberneticist and one of the two surviving scientists on the station when Kris arrives. He is world-weary, cynical, and often philosophical. Having been on the station for a long time, he has had ample time to reflect on his separation from Earth. His dialogue often touches upon the loss of humanity in space and the futility of their mission.\n*   **D. Sartorius:** A biologist, the other surviving scientist. He is rigid, emotionally detached, and completely dedicated to a scientific, objective approach to the Solaris phenomenon. He views emotions like nostalgia and homesickness as weaknesses that interfere with his work. It is highly out of character for him to admit to, let alone feel shame about, such a sentiment.\n*   **E. Gibarian:** A scientist and friend of Kris who commits suicide just before Kris's arrival. Kris watches a video testament he left behind. In the video, Gibarian is in a state of despair and terror, trying to warn Kris. His message is one of immediate crisis, not a nostalgic or shameful reflection on missing Earth.\n\n**Step 3: Locate the Specific Dialogue or Sentiment in the Film**\nThe key to answering the question is a specific conversation. Kris asks Dr. Snaut if he gets homesick. Snaut's response is complex and reveals a deep sense of alienation. He says (paraphrasing from various translations):\n\n\"I don't remember Earth much... only in patches... When I try to remember more... for some reason, I feel so ashamed.\"\n\nIn another part of their conversation, he speaks of how he misses things like birches and streams, and explicitly states, \"And for some reason you feel so ashamed of this homesickness.\" The specific memory he mentions is the \"smell of burnt leaves.\" The question combines this idea of a sensory memory of leaves with the explicitly stated emotion of shame. Snaut is the character who directly connects the feeling of shame with his homesickness and memories of Earth's nature.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude and Select the Correct Answer**\nBased on the analysis of the characters and their dialogue, Dr. Snaut is the one who expresses shame related to his nostalgic longing for Earth, which includes sensory memories of leaves. The other characters are preoccupied with different emotional and philosophical conflicts.\n\nTherefore, Snaut is the correct answer.\n\n<<<C>>>"
