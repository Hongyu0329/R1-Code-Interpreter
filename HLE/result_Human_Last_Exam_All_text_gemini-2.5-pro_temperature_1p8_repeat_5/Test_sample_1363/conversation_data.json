    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understand the Core Question:** The question asks to identify the specific ballroom dance where attempting to \"overturn\" a \"reverse turn\" would inherently violate the fundamental technique of that dance.\n\n2.  **Define Key Terms:**\n    *   **Reverse Turn:** A standard figure in all five listed ballroom dances, characterized by a turn to the left.\n    *   **Overturn:** To rotate more than the standard amount prescribed for the figure within its set number of steps. For instance, turning a full 360 degrees on a figure that is technically defined as a 270-degree (3/4) turn.\n    *   **Disregarding the Technique:** This is the most crucial part. It means the action of overturning would force the dancer to use movements or principles that are fundamentally incorrect or contrary to the core character and technical rules of that particular dance.\n\n3.  **Analyze Each Dance Option:**\n\n    *   **A. Viennese Waltz:** The essence of this dance is continuous, rapid rotation. While the basic reverse turn is designed for a 360-degree rotation over two bars, slightly overturning it would mean turning faster. This might be physically challenging and look rushed, but it doesn't fundamentally contradict the dance's core principle of continuous rotation.\n\n    *   **B. English Waltz & D. Slow Foxtrot:** These are \"swing\" dances. Their technique relies on principles like CBM (Contra Body Movement), body swing, sway, and rise & fall to create smooth, flowing, and rotational movement. Overturning figures is a common and essential part of advanced choreography in both dances. For example, a dancer might overturn a reverse turn from 3/8 to 7/8 to achieve a different alignment or enter a new pattern. This is achieved by amplifying the core techniques (more swing, more sway), not by violating them. Therefore, overturning is not only possible but is a feature of high-level dancing.\n\n    *   **E. Quickstep:** As another swing dance, Quickstep shares the foundational principles of Waltz and Foxtrot, albeit with a different rhythm and energy (hops, skips, runs). Overturning turns is extremely common to create dynamic and sharp changes of direction. Again, this is an application and extension of the dance's technique, not a violation of it.\n\n    *   **C. European Tango:** Tango stands apart from the other four dances. Its technique is fundamentally different.\n        *   **No Rise and Fall:** Movement is kept level, without the up-and-down motion of the swing dances.\n        *   **No Swing:** The body does not swing through space to generate momentum. Actions are sharp, staccato, and clipped.\n        *   **No Sway:** The upper body is not inclined sideways. The posture is strong and upright.\n        *   **Movement:** Turns in Tango are not generated by swing and momentum. They are more like swivels or sharp pivots executed with a \"no-flight\" quality, keeping the feet close to the floor. The amount of turn possible in a figure is naturally limited by this staccato, non-swinging technique.\n        *   **The Conflict:** To \"overturn\" a Tango reverse turn, a dancer would need to generate significantly more rotation. Without the technique of swing and sway, this is practically impossible to do cleanly. The natural impulse to achieve more turn would be to introduce body swing for momentum and sway for balance and control. However, introducing swing and sway is a direct violation of the most fundamental principles of Tango technique.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** In Waltz, Foxtrot, and Quickstep, overturning is a part of advanced technique that uses the core principles of swing and sway. In Tango, attempting to overturn a figure forces the dancer to introduce swing and sway, which are the very things that Tango technique strictly forbids. Therefore, it is impossible to overturn a reverse turn in Tango *without disregarding the technique*.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n\n*   The distinction between \"swing dances\" (Waltz, Foxtrot, Quickstep, Viennese Waltz) and a \"non-swing dance\" (Tango) is the central point.\n*   Overturning is a tool for choreographic variation in swing dances.\n*   In Tango, the lack of swing, sway, and rise & fall creates a technical framework that restricts the amount of rotation that can be achieved \"correctly\".\n*   The question is not about physical impossibility, but about technical impossibility *within the rules* of the dance style.\n\n<<<C>>>"
