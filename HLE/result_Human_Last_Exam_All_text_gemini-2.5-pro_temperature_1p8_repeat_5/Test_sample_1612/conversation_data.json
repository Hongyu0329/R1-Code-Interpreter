    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the number of Triple Crown winners in MLB history.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Term \"Triple Crown\" in MLB**\n\nThe first careful point is to recognize that \"Triple Crown\" can refer to two different achievements in baseball: one for batters (hitters) and one for pitchers. The user's question is general, so a complete answer should address both.\n\n*   **Batting Triple Crown:** A player must lead their league (American League or National League) in all three of the following categories in the same season:\n    1.  Batting Average (BA)\n    2.  Home Runs (HR)\n    3.  Runs Batted In (RBI)\n\n*   **Pitching Triple Crown:** A pitcher must lead their league in all three of the following categories in the same season:\n    1.  Wins (W)\n    2.  Earned Run Average (ERA)\n    3.  Strikeouts (SO)\n\n**Step 2: Identify and Count Batting Triple Crown Winners**\n\nThis is the more famous and commonly referenced of the two Triple Crowns. The question \"How many triple crown winners\" almost always refers to this achievement.\n\n*   **Careful Point:** We need to count the number of *unique players*, not the number of times it has been won. Some players have won it more than once.\n*   **List of Batting Triple Crown Winners (and year(s)):**\n    *   Paul Hines (1878)\n    *   Tip O'Neill (1887)\n    *   Hugh Duffy (1894)\n    *   Nap Lajoie (1901)\n    *   Ty Cobb (1909)\n    *   Heinie Zimmerman (1912)\n    *   Rogers Hornsby (1922, 1925) - *Won twice*\n    *   Jimmie Foxx (1933)\n    *   Chuck Klein (1933)\n    *   Lou Gehrig (1934)\n    *   Joe Medwick (1937)\n    *   Ted Williams (1942, 1947) - *Won twice*\n    *   Mickey Mantle (1956)\n    *   Frank Robinson (1966)\n    *   Carl Yastrzemski (1967)\n    *   Miguel Cabrera (2012)\n*   **Counting the Winners:** Counting each unique name on the list gives a total of **16** players.\n*   **Update/Correction:** The MLB official record also includes **Oscar Charleston** from the Negro National League in 1921. With the recent integration of Negro Leagues statistics into the official MLB record, he is now considered a Triple Crown winner. This brings the total to **17**.\n*   **Final Count (Batters):** There are **17** distinct players who have won the Batting Triple Crown. It has been accomplished a total of 19 times.\n\n**Step 3: Identify and Count Pitching Triple Crown Winners**\n\nAlthough less famous than its batting counterpart, this is still a prestigious achievement.\n\n*   **Careful Point:** Like with batters, we count the number of *unique pitchers*. This feat has been accomplished many times, with several pitchers winning it on multiple occasions.\n*   **Counting the Winners:** The list of pitchers is much longer and includes legends from the 19th century through the modern era. Notable multi-time winners include Walter Johnson (3 times), Pete Alexander (3 times), and Sandy Koufax (3 times).\n*   **Final Count (Pitchers):** According to the official MLB record, there have been **39** different pitchers who have won the Pitching Triple Crown. It has been achieved a total of 48 times.\n\n### Summary and Final Answer\n\nThe question \"How many triple crowns winners are there\" is most commonly understood to be asking about the Batting Triple Crown.\n\n*   For the **Batting Triple Crown**, there have been **17** unique players.\n*   For the **Pitching Triple Crown**, there have been **39** unique players.\n\nSince the batting version is the standard interpretation of the question, the most appropriate single answer is 17.\n\n<<<17>>>"
