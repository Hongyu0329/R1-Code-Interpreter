1. The Epistemic Regress Problem: The "justification" condition requires that any justification itself be justified, leading to an infinite regress. If the justification must be knowledge, it demands an infinite chain of prior knowledge. If it can be a mere belief, then knowledge is founded on potentially false grounds.
2. The Problem of Circularity: The "truth" condition is circular from a first-person perspective. To verify that one's belief 'P' is actually true (a requirement to call it knowledge), one must already have access to the truth of 'P', which is functionally equivalent to already knowing 'P'. This means you must know 'P' to prove you know 'P'.
