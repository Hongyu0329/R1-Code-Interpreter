    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the statement.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Define SNP Heritability (h²_SNP):**\n    *   SNP heritability represents the proportion of variation in a phenotype (a trait like height or a disease risk) that can be explained by the combined effects of all common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across the genome.\n    *   It is a population-level parameter that quantifies the *total genetic signal* available from these SNPs.\n    *   Crucially, it is considered the **theoretical upper limit** or ceiling on the predictive power achievable by any linear model that uses these SNPs as predictors. It represents what could be explained if we knew the *true* effect size of every single SNP.\n\n2.  **Define a Polygenic Score (PGS) and its Predictive Ability:**\n    *   A polygenic score is a practical tool used to predict an individual's phenotype. It is a single value calculated for an individual by summing up their alleles at many different SNPs, with each allele's contribution weighted by its estimated effect size.\n    *   These effect sizes are *not* the true, unknown effects. They are *estimated* from a Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS), which is conducted on a finite sample of people.\n    *   The \"predictive ability\" of a PGS is measured by how well it predicts the phenotype in a *new, independent* group of individuals (a target or testing sample). This is typically quantified by the R² value, which is the proportion of phenotypic variance explained by the PGS.\n\n3.  **Compare SNP Heritability and PGS Predictive Ability:**\n    *   The key difference lies between a **theoretical maximum (h²_SNP)** and a **practical, imperfect estimate (PGS)**.\n    *   A PGS is built using effect sizes from a GWAS with a limited sample size. This introduces several sources of error and imperfection:\n        *   **Estimation Error:** Because the GWAS sample size is not infinite, the estimated SNP effects are noisy and will deviate from the true effects.\n        *   **Incomplete Information:** GWAS may not identify all relevant SNPs, especially those with very small effects, due to stringent statistical thresholds.\n        *   **Winner's Curse:** SNPs that happen to pass the significance threshold in a particular GWAS often have their effect sizes overestimated.\n        *   **Linkage Disequilibrium (LD):** The statistical models used to create the PGS may not perfectly account for the complex correlation patterns between SNPs.\n\n4.  **Formulate the Conclusion:**\n    *   SNP heritability (h²_SNP) represents the total amount of variance that is theoretically possible to explain with SNPs. Think of it as a pie.\n    *   The predictive ability (R²) of a PGS represents how much of that pie we can *actually* \"eat\" or capture with our current tools (a specific GWAS and a specific PGS model).\n    *   Because our tools are imperfect (due to finite sample sizes, estimation errors, etc.), we can never capture the entire pie. We will always capture a slice that is smaller than the whole pie.\n    *   Therefore, the variance explained by a polygenic score (its R²) is *necessarily* lower than the total variance that is available to be explained (the SNP heritability). The only way they could be equal is in a hypothetical, unobtainable scenario of a PGS built from an infinitely large GWAS with perfect knowledge of the genetic architecture, which is not possible in practice.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Underlying Truth vs. Estimates:** The statement refers to the true values of predictive ability and heritability. While it's possible for a *statistical estimate* of R² in one sample to be higher than a *statistical estimate* of h²_SNP from another, due to random sampling error, the underlying principle is that the true predictive ability is bounded by the true SNP heritability.\n*   **Out-of-Sample Prediction:** The term \"predictive ability\" implies evaluation in an independent test set. If you were to calculate the variance explained by a PGS in the same data used to train it (in-sample prediction), you could get an inflated R² due to overfitting, but this would not be a true measure of its predictive power.\n*   **\"Necessarily\":** This strong word is appropriate because the relationship is not coincidental; it is a fundamental mathematical and biological constraint. The PGS is a specific model attempting to capture a signal, and the performance of the model cannot exceed the total signal that exists.\n\n---\nThe statement is True. The SNP heritability defines the theoretical maximum variance that can be explained by common SNPs, while a polygenic score's predictive ability reflects what can be practically achieved using effect sizes estimated from a finite GWAS sample. Due to inherent estimation errors and other limitations in building the score, the predictive ability of a PGS is an imperfect capture of this total heritability and will therefore be lower.\n\n<<<True>>>"
