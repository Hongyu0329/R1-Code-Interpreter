    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the partition function Z for the given system using path integrals.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Define the Grand Canonical Partition Function (Z)**\n\nThe partition function Z in the grand canonical ensemble is defined as the trace of the density operator:\n$Z = \\text{Tr} \\left[ e^{-\\beta (\\hat{H}_{sys} - \\mu \\hat{N})} \\right]$\nwhere:\n*   `β = 1/(k_B T)` is the inverse temperature.\n*   `μ` is the chemical potential.\n*   $\\hat{H}_{sys}$ is the system's Hamiltonian operator.\n*   $\\hat{N}$ is the particle number operator.\n\n**2. Interpret the Given Hamiltonian**\n\nThe question states the system has a Hamiltonian $\\hat{H} = -\\mu \\hat{N}$. A careful point here is to interpret this statement correctly. In the context of the grand canonical ensemble, the term \"Hamiltonian\" typically refers to the system's Hamiltonian, $\\hat{H}_{sys}$. Following this standard convention, we set:\n$\\hat{H}_{sys} = -\\mu \\hat{N}$\n\nNow, we substitute this into the grand canonical operator, which is the full operator in the exponent:\n$\\hat{K} = \\hat{H}_{sys} - \\mu \\hat{N} = (-\\mu \\hat{N}) - (\\mu \\hat{N}) = -2\\mu \\hat{N}$\n\nThis operator $\\hat{K}$ is what determines the system's dynamics in the imaginary time of the path integral formalism. In the language of second quantization, where $\\hat{N} = \\sum_k \\hat{a}_k^\\dagger \\hat{a}_k$, the operator is $\\hat{K} = \\sum_k (-2\\mu) \\hat{a}_k^\\dagger \\hat{a}_k$. This means that for each single-particle state (or mode) `k`, the effective single-particle energy in this ensemble is $E = -2\\mu$.\n\n**3. Formulate the Path Integral**\n\nThe partition function Z can be expressed as a functional integral (path integral) over coherent states (complex fields $\\psi$ for bosons, Grassmann fields $\\psi$ for fermions):\n$Z = \\int \\mathcal{D}[\\psi^*, \\psi] e^{-S[\\psi^*, \\psi]}$\n\nThe action, S, is given by:\n$S = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\left[ \\sum_k \\psi_k^*(\\tau) \\partial_\\tau \\psi_k(\\tau) + K(\\psi_k^*, \\psi_k) \\right]$\nwhere $K(\\psi_k^*, \\psi_k)$ is the normal-ordered form of the operator $\\hat{K}$. For our system, $\\hat{K} = -2\\mu \\sum_k \\hat{a}_k^\\dagger \\hat{a}_k$, so $K(\\psi_k^*, \\psi_k) = -2\\mu \\sum_k \\psi_k^*(\\tau) \\psi_k(\\tau)$.\n\nSubstituting this into the action gives:\n$S = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\sum_k \\left[ \\psi_k^*(\\tau) \\partial_\\tau \\psi_k(\\tau) - 2\\mu \\psi_k^*(\\tau) \\psi_k(\\tau) \\right]$\n$S = \\sum_k \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\, \\psi_k^*(\\tau) (\\partial_\\tau - 2\\mu) \\psi_k(\\tau)$\n\nSince the action is a sum over independent modes `k`, the partition function becomes a product over the modes:\n$Z = \\prod_k Z_k$\nwhere $Z_k = \\int \\mathcal{D}[\\psi_k^*, \\psi_k] e^{-\\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\, \\psi_k^*(\\tau) (\\partial_\\tau - 2\\mu) \\psi_k(\\tau)}$.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Path Integral**\n\nThis is a Gaussian path integral, and its result is given by the determinant of the operator in the action.\n$Z_k = [\\text{det}(\\partial_\\tau - 2\\mu)]^\\eta$\nwhere:\n*   $\\eta = +1$ for fermions (Grassmann variables).\n*   $\\eta = -1$ for bosons (complex variables).\n\nTo find the determinant, we find the product of the eigenvalues of the operator $(\\partial_\\tau - 2\\mu)$. We work in a basis of functions $e^{-i\\omega_n \\tau}$ where $\\omega_n$ are the Matsubara frequencies. The eigenvalues of $\\partial_\\tau$ are $-i\\omega_n$. Thus, the eigenvalues of our operator are $(-i\\omega_n - 2\\mu)$.\n\nThe boundary conditions on the fields determine the Matsubara frequencies:\n*   **Fermions:** Anti-periodic boundary conditions $\\psi_k(\\beta) = -\\psi_k(0)$, which gives $\\omega_n = (2n+1)\\pi/\\beta$ for $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n*   **Bosons:** Periodic boundary conditions $\\psi_k(\\beta) = \\psi_k(0)$, which gives $\\omega_n = 2n\\pi/\\beta$ for $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nWe now analyze the fermionic and bosonic cases separately. A crucial careful point is that the result of the path integral evaluation directly provides the full partition function, which includes the contribution from the quantum vacuum energy, unlike some textbook statistical mechanics calculations.\n\n**5. Case 1: Fermions ($\\eta = +1$)**\n\nFor a single fermionic mode `k`:\n$Z_{k, F} = \\text{det}(\\partial_\\tau - 2\\mu) = \\prod_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} (-i\\omega_n - 2\\mu)$\nwith $\\omega_n = (2n+1)\\pi/\\beta$. This is a standard product in quantum field theory, which evaluates to:\n$Z_{k, F} = 2 \\cosh\\left(\\frac{\\beta(-2\\mu)}{2}\\right) = 2 \\cosh(-\\beta\\mu)$\nSince $\\cosh(x)$ is an even function, $\\cosh(-\\beta\\mu) = \\cosh(\\beta\\mu)$.\n$Z_{k, F} = 2 \\cosh(\\beta\\mu)$\n\n**6. Case 2: Bosons ($\\eta = -1$)**\n\nFor a single bosonic mode `k`:\n$Z_{k, B} = [\\text{det}(\\partial_\\tau - 2\\mu)]^{-1} = \\left[ \\prod_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} (-i\\omega_n - 2\\mu) \\right]^{-1}$\nwith $\\omega_n = 2n\\pi/\\beta$. This product evaluates to:\n$Z_{k, B} = \\left[ 2 \\sinh\\left(\\frac{\\beta(-2\\mu)}{2}\\right) \\right]^{-1} = \\left[ 2 \\sinh(-\\beta\\mu) \\right]^{-1}$\n\nA careful point for bosons is system stability. The grand canonical partition function converges only if the effective energy is positive, i.e., $E = -2\\mu > 0$, which implies the chemical potential must be negative ($\\mu < 0$).\nIf $\\mu < 0$, then $-\\beta\\mu > 0$, and $\\sinh(-\\beta\\mu)$ is positive, so the partition function is well-defined and positive.\n\n**7. Final Answer Formulation**\n\nThe total partition function is the product over all available single-particle states. Assuming there are `M` identical, non-interacting modes in the system:\n$Z = (Z_k)^M$\n\nThus, we have two distinct results depending on the particle statistics.\n\n*   **For a system of Fermions:**\n    $Z_F = [2 \\cosh(\\beta\\mu)]^M$\n\n*   **For a system of Bosons:**\n    $Z_B = [2 \\sinh(-\\beta\\mu)]^{-M}$\n    (This is valid under the condition that $\\mu < 0$ for stability). Note that since $\\sinh(-x) = -\\sinh(x)$, this can also be written as $[-2\\sinh(\\beta\\mu)]^{-M}$. As $\\mu<0$, $\\sinh(\\beta\\mu)<0$, making the base of the power positive.\n\nSince the problem does not specify the particle statistics, both results are provided.\n\n***\n\nThe final answer is a function of the chemical potential `μ`, the inverse temperature `β`, and the number of states `M`. It depends critically on whether the particles are fermions or bosons.\n\nFor a system of **Fermions** with M identical states:\n$Z_F = [2 \\cosh(\\beta\\mu)]^M$\n\nFor a system of **Bosons** with M identical states (requiring $\\mu < 0$ for convergence):\n$Z_B = [2 \\sinh(-\\beta\\mu)]^{-M}$\n\nIf M=1, the answers are for a single state. If the number of states is unspecified, the answer is a product over all states k, but since the energy is identical for all k, the expression becomes the M-th power.\n\n<<<\nFor a system of M identical fermionic states: $Z_F = (2 \\cosh(\\beta \\mu))^M$\nFor a system of M identical bosonic states (valid for $\\mu < 0$): $Z_B = (2 \\sinh(-\\beta \\mu))^{-M}$\n>>>"
