    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to design the deadbeat observer.\n\n**1. Understand the System and Objective**\n\nWe are given a discrete-time linear time-invariant (LTI) system:\n`x(k + 1) = Ax(k) + Bu(k)`\n`y(k) = Cx(k)`\n\nwith the matrices:\n`A = [-1 0 0 1; 1 0 0 2; 0 1 0 -1; -1 0 1 -1]`\n`B = [0; 1; -1; 1]`\n`C = [1 0 0 0; 1 0 0 1]`\n\nThe system has `n=4` states and `p=2` outputs.\n\nThe objective is to design a full-state observer of the form:\n`x_hat(k + 1) = Ax_hat(k) + Bu(k) + L(y(k) - Cx_hat(k))`\nsuch that the observation error, `e(k) = x(k) - x_hat(k)`, converges to zero in the shortest possible number of steps. This is known as a deadbeat observer.\n\n**2. Observer Error Dynamics**\n\nThe dynamics of the observation error are given by:\n`e(k + 1) = (A - LC)e(k)`\n\nFor the error to go to zero in a finite number of steps, say `v` steps, for any initial error `e(0)`, the error dynamics matrix `(A - LC)` must be nilpotent. Specifically, we need `(A - LC)^v = 0`, where `v` is the smallest possible integer.\n\n**3. Observability and Shortest Time (Observability Index)**\n\nA deadbeat observer can be designed if and only if the system is observable. The shortest number of steps `v` is determined by the system's observability index, `v_o`. We need to calculate this index.\n\nThe observability matrix is `O = [C^T; (CA)^T; (CA^2)^T; ...]^T`. We find the rank of sub-matrices `O_k = [C; CA; ...; CA^(k-1)]`. The observability index `v_o` is the smallest `k` such that `rank(O_k) = n = 4`.\n\n*   `C = [1 0 0 0; 1 0 0 1]`. Rank is 2.\n*   `CA = [1 0 0 0; 1 0 0 1] * [-1 0 0 1; 1 0 0 2; 0 1 0 -1; -1 0 1 -1] = [-1 0 0 1; -2 0 1 0]`.\n*   Let's check `rank(O_2) = rank([C; CA])`.\n    `O_2 = [1 0 0 0; 1 0 0 1; -1 0 0 1; -2 0 1 0]`. The rows `[1,0,0,0]`, `[1,0,0,1]`, and `[-1,0,0,1]` are linearly dependent (`2*row1 - row2 + row3 = 0`), but the set of rows `{[1,0,0,0], [1,0,0,1], [-2,0,1,0]}` is linearly independent. So, `rank(O_2) = 3`. Since rank is less than 4, `v_o > 2`.\n*   Let's compute `CA^2`.\n    `A^2 = [-1 0 0 1; 1 0 0 2; 0 1 0 -1; -1 0 1 -1]^2 = [0 0 1 -2; 1 0 2 -1; 0 0 1 3; 0 1 -1 0]`.\n    `CA^2 = C * A^2 = [0 0 1 -2; 0 1 0 -2]`.\n*   Let's check `rank(O_3) = rank([C; CA; CA^2])`.\n    The matrix `[row1(C); row2(C); row2(CA); row2(CA^2)]` is `[1 0 0 0; 1 0 0 1; -2 0 1 0; 0 1 0 -2]`. The determinant of this 4x4 matrix is -1.\n    Since we found a 4x4 submatrix with non-zero determinant, the rank of `O_3` is 4.\n\nThe observability index is `v_o = 3`. This means the error can be made zero in 3 steps, so we need to find `L` such that `(A - LC)^3 = 0`.\n\n**4. Deadbeat Observer Design Strategy**\n\nThe condition `(A - LC)^3 = 0` implies that the minimal polynomial of `A-LC` is a divisor of `z^3`, and its characteristic polynomial is `z^4`. We need to choose the gain matrix `L` (a 4x2 matrix) to give the error dynamics matrix, let's call it `A_e = A - LC`, a structure that is nilpotent of order 3.\n\nA key structural constraint on `A_e` is due to the structure of `C`.\n`LC = L * C = [l11 l12; l21 l22; l31 l32; l41 l42] * [1 0 0 0; 1 0 0 1]`\n`LC = [l11+l12, 0, 0, l12;`\n     `l21+l22, 0, 0, l22;`\n     `l31+l32, 0, 0, l32;`\n     `l41+l42, 0, 0, l42]`\n\nThe second and third columns of `LC` are always zero. This means the second and third columns of `A_e = A - LC` are fixed and equal to the corresponding columns of `A`.\n`col_2(A) = [0; 0; 1; 0]` (which is the standard basis vector `e_3`)\n`col_3(A) = [0; 0; 0; 1]` (which is the standard basis vector `e_4`)\n\nSo, `A_e` must have the structure:\n`A_e = [c1, e3, e4, c4]` where `c1` and `c4` are the first and fourth columns that we can shape by choosing `L`.\n\nNow let's find what structure `A_e` needs to satisfy `A_e^3 = 0`.\n`A_e * e2 = col_2(A_e) = e3`\n`A_e * e3 = col_3(A_e) = e4`\n`A_e^2 * e2 = A_e * (A_e * e2) = A_e * e3 = e4`\n`A_e^3 * e2 = A_e * (A_e^2 * e2) = A_e * e4 = c4`\nFor `A_e^3` to be the zero matrix, all its columns must be zero. So, `A_e^3 * e2` must be zero, which means `c4 = 0`.\n\nIf `c4 = 0`, then `A_e = [c1, e3, e4, 0]`.\n`A_e^2 = A_e * A_e = [A_e*c1, A_e*e3, A_e*e4, A_e*0] = [A_e*c1, e4, 0, 0]`\n`A_e^3 = A_e * A_e^2 = [A_e*(A_e*c1), A_e*e4, A_e*0, A_e*0] = [A_e^2*c1, 0, 0, 0]`\nFor `A_e^3 = 0`, we need `A_e^2 * c1 = 0`.\nFrom the calculation above, `A_e^2` has `e4` in its second column and zeros elsewhere in the top row. The simplest way to ensure `A_e^2*c1=0` is to set `c1=0`.\n\nSo, we choose a target `A_e` matrix: `A_e = [0, e3, e4, 0]`. This is equivalent to setting the first and fourth columns of `A_e` to zero.\n`A_e = [0 0 0 0; 0 0 0 0; 0 1 0 0; 0 0 1 0]`.\nWe checked that this matrix `A_e` satisfies `A_e^3=0`.\n\n**5. Calculate the Gain Matrix L**\n\nWe enforce the condition `A - LC = A_e`. This gives `LC = A - A_e`.\n`LC = [-1 0 0 1; 1 0 0 2; 0 1 0 -1; -1 0 1 -1] - [0 0 0 0; 0 0 0 0; 0 1 0 0; 0 0 1 0]`\n`LC = [-1 0 0 1; 1 0 0 2; 0 0 0 -1; -1 0 0 -1]`\n\nNow we solve for `L` using `LC` and the known structure of `LC`:\n`[l11+l12, 0, 0, l12;`\n `l21+l22, 0, 0, l22;`\n `l31+l32, 0, 0, l32;`\n `l41+l42, 0, 0, l42]` = `[-1 0 0 1; 1 0 0 2; 0 0 0 -1; -1 0 0 -1]`\n\nBy comparing the matrices element by element (specifically the first and fourth columns), we get two sets of equations:\n\nFrom the fourth column:\n`l12 = 1`\n`l22 = 2`\n`l32 = -1`\n`l42 = -1`\n\nFrom the first column:\n`l11 + l12 = -1`  => `l11 + 1 = -1` => `l11 = -2`\n`l21 + l22 = 1`   => `l21 + 2 = 1`  => `l21 = -1`\n`l31 + l32 = 0`   => `l31 - 1 = 0`  => `l31 = 1`\n`l41 + l42 = -1`  => `l41 - 1 = -1` => `l41 = 0`\n\nCombining these results gives the observer gain matrix `L`.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe gain matrix `L` is:\n`L = [-2 1; -1 2; 1 -1; 0 -1]`\n\n<<<[[-2, 1], [-1, 2], [1, -1], [0, -1]]>>>"
