    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Problem Statement**\n\n*   We are given the 4-point Discrete Fourier Transforms (DFT) of two 4-point sequences, `x(n)` and `h(n)`.\n    *   `X(k) = DFT{x(n)} = [1, j, -1, -j]` for k = 0, 1, 2, 3.\n    *   `H(k) = DFT{h(n)} = [0, 1+j, 1, 1-j]` for k = 0, 1, 2, 3.\n*   We need to find the DFT of a new 8-point sequence, `y(m)`, which is formed by interleaving `x(n)` and `h(n)`.\n*   The new sequence is `y(m) = {x(0), h(0), x(1), h(1), x(2), h(2), x(3), h(3)}`.\n*   The question asks for the \"4-point DFT\" of this 8-point sequence, which is a typo. It should be the **8-point DFT**. We will proceed with finding the 8-point DFT, which we will call `Y(p)`.\n\n**2. Relate the 8-point DFT to the 4-point DFTs**\n\nThis problem is a direct application of the Decimation-In-Time Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm. The algorithm shows how to compute a DFT of size `N` from two DFTs of size `N/2`.\n\nLet `y(m)` be our 8-point sequence. We can define its elements as:\n*   Even-indexed elements: `y(2n) = x(n)` for `n = 0, 1, 2, 3`.\n*   Odd-indexed elements: `y(2n+1) = h(n)` for `n = 0, 1, 2, 3`.\n\nThe 8-point DFT `Y(p)` is defined as:\n`Y(p) = Σ_{m=0}^{7} y(m) * W_8^(mp)`, where `W_N^k = e^(-j2πk/N)`.\n\nWe can split the sum into even and odd indices of `m`:\n`Y(p) = Σ_{n=0}^{3} y(2n) * W_8^(2np) + Σ_{n=0}^{3} y(2n+1) * W_8^((2n+1)p)`\n\nSubstitute `y(2n)=x(n)` and `y(2n+1)=h(n)`:\n`Y(p) = Σ_{n=0}^{3} x(n) * W_8^(2np) + Σ_{n=0}^{3} h(n) * W_8^p * W_8^(2np)`\n\nUsing the property `W_N^(2k) = W_(N/2)^k`, we have `W_8^(2np) = W_4^(np)`:\n`Y(p) = Σ_{n=0}^{3} x(n) * W_4^(np) + W_8^p * Σ_{n=0}^{3} h(n) * W_4^(np)`\n\nThe summations are the 4-point DFTs of `x(n)` and `h(n)`. So, we get:\n`Y(p) = X(p mod 4) + W_8^p * H(p mod 4)`\n\nThis formula allows us to compute the 8-point `Y(p)` directly from the given 4-point `X(k)` and `H(k)`. This is often expressed in the \"butterfly\" structure:\n*   `Y(p) = X(p) + W_8^p * H(p)` for `p = 0, 1, 2, 3`\n*   `Y(p+4) = X(p) - W_8^p * H(p)` for `p = 0, 1, 2, 3`\n\n**3. List Required Values**\n\n*   `X(k) = [1, j, -1, -j]`\n*   `H(k) = [0, 1+j, 1, 1-j]`\n*   8-point twiddle factors `W_8^p = e^(-jπp/4)`:\n    *   `W_8^0 = 1`\n    *   `W_8^1 = cos(π/4) - j*sin(π/4) = (1-j)/√2`\n    *   `W_8^2 = cos(π/2) - j*sin(π/2) = -j`\n    *   `W_8^3 = cos(3π/4) - j*sin(3π/4) = (-1-j)/√2`\n\n**4. Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\n*   **For p = 0:**\n    `Y(0) = X(0) + W_8^0 * H(0) = 1 + (1)(0) = 1`\n\n*   **For p = 1:**\n    `Y(1) = X(1) + W_8^1 * H(1) = j + ((1-j)/√2) * (1+j)`\n    Since `(1-j)(1+j) = 1 - j^2 = 2`, this becomes:\n    `Y(1) = j + 2/√2 = j + √2`\n\n*   **For p = 2:**\n    `Y(2) = X(2) + W_8^2 * H(2) = -1 + (-j)(1) = -1 - j`\n\n*   **For p = 3:**\n    `Y(3) = X(3) + W_8^3 * H(3) = -j + ((-1-j)/√2) * (1-j)`\n    Since `(-1-j)(1-j) = -1 + j - j + j^2 = -2`, this becomes:\n    `Y(3) = -j - 2/√2 = -j - √2`\n\nNow we calculate the second half using `Y(p+4) = X(p) - W_8^p * H(p)`:\n\n*   **For p = 4 (k=0):**\n    `Y(4) = X(0) - W_8^0 * H(0) = 1 - (1)(0) = 1`\n\n*   **For p = 5 (k=1):**\n    `Y(5) = X(1) - W_8^1 * H(1) = j - ((1-j)/√2) * (1+j) = j - 2/√2 = j - √2`\n\n*   **For p = 6 (k=2):**\n    `Y(6) = X(2) - W_8^2 * H(2) = -1 - (-j)(1) = -1 + j`\n\n*   **For p = 7 (k=3):**\n    `Y(7) = X(3) - W_8^3 * H(3) = -j - ((-1-j)/√2) * (1-j) = -j - (-2/√2) = -j + √2`\n\n**5. Final Answer**\n\nCombining the results, the 8-point DFT of the sequence is:\n`Y(p) = {Y(0), Y(1), Y(2), Y(3), Y(4), Y(5), Y(6), Y(7)}`\n\n`Y(p) = [1, √2+j, -1-j, -√2-j, 1, -√2+j, -1+j, √2-j]`\n\n<<<[1, sqrt(2)+j, -1-j, -sqrt(2)-j, 1, -sqrt(2)+j, -1+j, sqrt(2)-j]>>>"
