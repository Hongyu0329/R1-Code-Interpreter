    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the computational time complexity of the algorithm `IMAG(n, c)`.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Primary Operation and Input:** The algorithm's purpose is to convert an integer `n` to its representation in base `c`. The inputs are `n` and `c`. The time complexity will be a function of these inputs. The core of the algorithm is the `while` loop, as its number of executions depends on the magnitude of the inputs.\n\n2.  **Analyze the `while` Loop's Controlling Variable:** The loop continues as long as the variable `q` is greater than 0. Let's analyze how `q` changes.\n    *   Before the loop, `q` is initialized to `⌊n/c⌋`.\n    *   Inside the loop, `x` takes the value of the previous `q`, and a new `q` is calculated as `⌊x/c⌋`. Effectively, in each iteration, the value of `q` from the previous step is divided by `c`.\n\n3.  **Determine the Number of Loop Iterations:** The loop terminates when `q` becomes 0. Let's trace the sequence of values that `q` is derived from.\n    *   Initial `x = n`.\n    *   After 1st division (in Step 1): `q ≈ n/c`\n    *   After 2nd division (1st loop iteration): `q ≈ (n/c)/c = n/c^2`\n    *   After 3rd division (2nd loop iteration): `q ≈ (n/c^2)/c = n/c^3`\n    *   After `k+1` divisions (k-th loop iteration): `q ≈ n/c^(k+1)`\n\n    The loop stops when this value of `q` becomes 0. This occurs when `n/c^(k+1) < 1`. We can rewrite this inequality as `n < c^(k+1)`. To find `k` (the number of loop iterations), we can take the logarithm of base `c` on both sides:\n    `log_c(n) < k+1`\n    This means `k > log_c(n) - 1`. The number of times the loop runs, `k`, is `⌊log_c(n)⌋`. Therefore, the number of iterations is proportional to `log_c(n)`.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Work Done Per Iteration:** Inside the `while` loop, the following operations are performed in each iteration:\n    *   `i := i + 1`: One addition and one assignment.\n    *   `x := q`: One assignment.\n    *   `q := ⌊x/c⌋`: One integer division.\n    *   `a_i := x - q*c`: One multiplication and one subtraction.\n\n    This is a small, fixed number of basic arithmetic and assignment operations.\n\n5.  **Calculate Total Complexity:** We combine the number of iterations with the work done per iteration.\n    *   **Cost Model:** We assume the **uniform cost model**, where basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) on integers are considered to take constant time, denoted as `O(1)`. This is a standard assumption for analyzing algorithms unless dealing with arbitrary-precision numbers.\n    *   **Work before loop (Step 1):** This step also involves a constant number of `O(1)` operations.\n    *   **Work inside loop:** The cost of one iteration is `O(1)`.\n    *   **Total Time Complexity:** The total time is the sum of the initial work and the work done by the loop.\n        *   Total Time = (Work before loop) + (Number of iterations) × (Work per iteration)\n        *   Total Time = `O(1) + O(log_c n) × O(1)`\n        *   Total Time = `O(log_c n)`\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Complexity is Logarithmic:** The algorithm does not perform `n` operations. Instead, it performs operations proportional to the number of digits in the base `c` representation of `n`, which is `⌊log_c n⌋ + 1`. This makes the algorithm very efficient.\n2.  **Dependence on `c`:** The complexity `O(log_c n)` correctly shows the dependence on the base `c`. A larger base `c` results in fewer digits and thus fewer loop iterations.\n3.  **Choice of Computational Model:** The result `O(log_c n)` hinges on the uniform cost model assumption that arithmetic operations take `O(1)` time. If the input number `n` is too large to fit in a single machine word, one would need to use a more detailed model like the logarithmic cost model (or bit complexity). In that model, operations like division and multiplication take time proportional to the number of bits in the operands, leading to a higher complexity, typically `O((log n)^2)`. For most standard algorithm analysis contexts, the uniform cost model is assumed, making `O(log_c n)` the expected answer.\n4.  **Number of Digits:** The number of times the loop body is executed is `i_{final} = ⌊log_c n⌋`. The algorithm essentially performs a constant amount of work for each digit of the result `(a_i, ..., a_0)`, and the number of digits is `i_{final} + 1`.\n\n### Final Answer Acquisition\n\n*   **Initialization (Step 1):** Constant time, `O(1)`.\n*   **Loop Condition:** The loop runs as long as `q > 0`.\n*   **Loop Execution Count:** The value of `q` is reduced by a factor of `c` in each step (approximately). The number of times you can divide `n` by `c` until the result is 0 is `O(log_c n)`.\n*   **Work per Loop Iteration:** A constant number of `O(1)` operations.\n*   **Total Complexity:** `O(1) + O(log_c n) * O(1) = O(log_c n)`.\n\n<<<O(log_c n)>>>"
