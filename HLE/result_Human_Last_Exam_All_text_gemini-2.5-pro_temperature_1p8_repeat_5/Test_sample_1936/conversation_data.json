    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the smallest number `n` such that a set of `n` elements with a binary operation is not a group.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the definition of a Group**\n\nA group is a mathematical structure `(G, ·)` consisting of a set `G` and a binary operation `·` that satisfies four fundamental properties, called group axioms:\n1.  **Closure:** For any two elements `a` and `b` in `G`, the result of `a · b` is also in `G`. The definition of a \"binary operation on G\" already guarantees this property.\n2.  **Associativity:** For any elements `a`, `b`, and `c` in `G`, the equation `(a · b) · c = a · (b · c)` holds.\n3.  **Identity Element:** There exists an element `e` in `G`, called the identity element, such that for every element `a` in `G`, `e · a = a · e = a`.\n4.  **Inverse Element:** For each element `a` in `G`, there exists an element `b` in `G`, called the inverse of `a`, such that `a · b = b · a = e`, where `e` is the identity element.\n\nThe question asks for the smallest size `n` of the set `G` for which it is possible to define a binary operation `·` such that `(G, ·)` fails to satisfy at least one of these axioms (specifically, associativity, identity, or inverse).\n\n**Careful Point 1:** By standard convention in algebra, a group must be a non-empty set. This is because the identity axiom requires the *existence* of an element. Therefore, we should start our search for `n` from positive integers, i.e., `n = 1, 2, 3, ...`.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the case n = 1**\n\nLet's consider a set `G` with only one element, say `G = {e}`.\n*   **Binary Operation:** There is only one possible binary operation we can define on `G`. The operation table (Cayley table) would have one entry: `e · e`. For the closure property to hold, the result must be in `G`. Since `e` is the only element, we must have `e · e = e`.\n*   **Check the group axioms:**\n    *   **Closure:** `e · e = e`, which is in `G`. This is satisfied.\n    *   **Associativity:** `(e · e) · e = e · e = e`. Also, `e · (e · e) = e · e = e`. So, associativity holds.\n    *   **Identity Element:** We need an element, let's call it `id`, such that `id · e = e · id = e`. The element `e` itself satisfies this, since `e · e = e`. So, `e` is the identity element.\n    *   **Inverse Element:** For the element `e`, we need an inverse `e_inv` such that `e · e_inv = e`. Since `e` is the identity, the inverse of `e` is `e` itself because `e · e = e`. So, an inverse exists for every element.\n\nSince all four axioms are satisfied, any set of size 1 with a binary operation will always form a group (this is known as the trivial group). Therefore, `n` cannot be 1.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the case n = 2**\n\nLet's consider a set `G` with two elements, say `G = {a, b}`. The question is whether we can define a binary operation `·` on `G` that results in a non-group. We only need to find one such example.\n\n**Careful Point 2:** We can try to construct an operation that specifically violates one of the axioms. The easiest axiom to violate is often the identity axiom.\n\nLet's define a very simple operation where the result is always the first element: `x · y = x` for any `x, y` in `G`. The operation table for this is:\n```\n  · | a | b\n ---|---|---\n  a | a | a\n  b | b | b\n```\n*   **Check the group axioms:**\n    *   **Closure:** All results in the table are `a` or `b`, which are elements of `G`. Closure is satisfied.\n    *   **Associativity:** Let's check: `(x · y) · z = x · z = x`. And `x · (y · z) = x · y = x`. The operation is associative.\n    *   **Identity Element:** We need to find an element `e` in `G` such that for all `x` in `G`, `e · x = x`.\n        *   Let's test if `a` is the identity. We would need `a · b = b`. But according to our table, `a · b = a`. So, `a` is not the identity element.\n        *   Let's test if `b` is the identity. We would need `b · a = a`. But according to our table, `b · a = b`. So, `b` is not the identity element.\n    *   Since neither `a` nor `b` can serve as the identity element, this structure `(G, ·)` has no identity element.\n\nBecause the identity axiom is not satisfied, `(G, ·)` is not a group.\n\n**Step 4: Conclusion**\n\n*   For `n = 1`, it is impossible to define a binary operation that results in a non-group; any such structure is the trivial group.\n*   For `n = 2`, we successfully constructed an example of a set with a binary operation that does not form a group.\n\nTherefore, the smallest number `n` for which such a set and operation exist is 2.\n\n<<<2>>>"
