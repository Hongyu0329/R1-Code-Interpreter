    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rarest noble gas on Earth.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Noble Gases**\nThe first step is to list all the elements that are classified as noble gases (Group 18 of the periodic table). These are:\n*   Helium (He)\n*   Neon (Ne)\n*   Argon (Ar)\n*   Krypton (Kr)\n*   Xenon (Xe)\n*   Radon (Rn)\n*   Oganesson (Og)\n\n**Step 2: Consider the Scope of the Question (\"on Earth\")**\nThe question asks about the abundance of these gases \"on Earth.\" This implies we should only consider gases that occur naturally in the terrestrial environment (atmosphere, crust, oceans).\n\n*   **Oganesson (Og)** is a purely synthetic element. It has only been created in a laboratory, atom by atom, and does not exist in nature. Therefore, its natural abundance on Earth is zero. For questions about natural abundance, it is typically excluded from consideration.\n\nThis leaves the six naturally occurring noble gases for comparison.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the time constraint (\"in 2002\")**\nThe question specifies the year 2002. However, the overall abundance of naturally occurring elements on Earth does not change significantly on a year-to-year timescale. The geological and atmospheric processes that govern their concentrations operate over thousands or millions of years. Therefore, the data from around that period or current standard data is perfectly valid for answering the question.\n\n**Step 4: Compare the Abundances of Stable Noble Gases**\nThe majority of Earth's non-radioactive noble gases are found in the atmosphere. Their abundances in the atmosphere (by volume) are a good starting point for comparison:\n*   **Argon (Ar):** ~0.934% or 9,340 parts per million (ppm). It is the most abundant noble gas.\n*   **Neon (Ne):** ~18.18 ppm\n*   **Helium (He):** ~5.24 ppm\n*   **Krypton (Kr):** ~1.14 ppm\n*   **Xenon (Xe):** ~0.087 ppm (or 87 parts per billion)\n\nFrom this list, **Xenon (Xe)** is clearly the rarest of the stable, non-radioactive noble gases.\n\n**Step 5: Factor in the Radioactive Noble Gas, Radon (Rn)**\nNow, we must consider Radon. Radon is different from the other noble gases because all its isotopes are radioactive.\n\n*   **Origin:** Radon is not a primordial element from Earth's formation. It is continuously generated as a part of the natural decay chain of uranium and thorium, which are found in trace amounts in rock and soil worldwide.\n*   **Short Half-Life:** The most stable isotope, Radon-222, has a very short half-life of only 3.8 days. This means that once formed, it decays away very quickly.\n*   **Extremely Low Concentration:** Because Radon decays so rapidly, it cannot accumulate in the environment. Its concentration at any given moment is extremely low, far lower than any of the stable noble gases. While its concentration varies greatly by location, its average concentration in the atmosphere is on the order of 10⁻¹⁹ ppm, which is many million times lower than Xenon's concentration.\n\n**Step 6: Final Comparison and Conclusion**\nWhen we compare the rarest stable noble gas (Xenon) with the radioactive noble gas (Radon), it becomes evident that Radon is vastly rarer.\n\n*   The total mass of **Xenon** in Earth's atmosphere is estimated to be over a trillion kilograms (10¹² kg).\n*   The total mass of **Radon** on the entire planet (in the atmosphere, soil, and oceans combined) at any single moment is estimated to be only a few thousand kilograms (10³ kg).\n\nTherefore, despite being continuously produced, Radon's extremely short half-life makes it the rarest noble gas on Earth by a very large margin.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n1.  **Natural vs. Synthetic:** It's crucial to distinguish between naturally occurring elements and synthetic ones. Oganesson is not part of Earth's natural composition.\n2.  **Stable vs. Radioactive:** The stability of an element is a key factor in its abundance. Radon's radioactivity and short half-life are the direct cause of its rarity.\n3.  **Total Terrestrial Matter:** While most noble gases are measured in the atmosphere, Radon is also present in soil and water. However, even when considering all reservoirs, its total amount remains minuscule compared to Xenon.\n4.  **Significance of the Year:** The specified year (2002) does not alter the fundamental ranking of elemental abundances, which are governed by long-term geological and nuclear processes.\n\n<<<Radon>>>"
