    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the scansion for the line:\n\"et tibi bene esse soli quom sibi sit male\"\n\nThe meter is an Iambic Senarius, a line of six iambic feet (`S L`). Roman comic poets like Plautus, from whom this line comes, used many variations and resolutions, making scansion complex.\n\n**1. Preliminary Analysis of Syllables and Quantities:**\n\n*   **`et`**: One syllable. The vowel `e` is short, but it is followed by two consonants (the `t` of `et` and the `t` of `tibi`), making it long by position. **(L)**\n*   **`tibi`**: Two syllables, `ti-bi`. Both vowels are naturally short. **(S S)**\n*   **`bene`**: Two syllables, `be-ne`. Both vowels are naturally short. **(S S)**\n*   **`esse`**: Two syllables, `es-se`. The first syllable `es-` is long by position (followed by `ss`). The second, `-se`, is short. **(L S)**\n*   **`sōlī`**: Two syllables, `sō-lī`. Both vowels are long by nature. **(L L)**\n*   **`quom`**: One syllable. An archaic spelling of `cum`. The vowel `o` is followed by two consonants (`m` and the `s` of `sibi`), so it is long by position. **(L)**\n*   **`sibi`**: Two syllables, `si-bi`. Both vowels are naturally short. **(S S)**\n*   **`sit`**: One syllable. The vowel `i` is short, but normally long by position (followed by `t` and the `m` of `male`).\n*   **`male`**: Two syllables, `ma-le`. Both vowels are short. **(S S)**\n\n**2. Applying Plautine Metrical Rules:**\n\n*   **Elision**: A final vowel (or vowel + m) is dropped before a word starting with a vowel. Here, the final `-e` of `bene` is elided before `esse`.\n    *   `bene esse` is pronounced as one unit, `ben'esse`.\n    *   This is syllabified as `be-nes-se`. `be-` is short **(S)**. `-nes-` is long by position **(L)**. `-se` is short **(S)**. So, `ben'esse` scans as `S L S`.\n    *   This elision reduces the line's syllable count from 15 to 14. An Iambic Senarius should have 12 syllables, so we expect resolutions (feet with 3 syllables).\n\n*   **Iambic Shortening (Brevis Brevians)**: A long syllable can be shortened if it is preceded by a short syllable in certain contexts. This applies to `sit`.\n    *   The phrase is `...sĭbĭ sīt...`. The long monosyllable `sīt` is preceded by a short syllable (`-bĭ`). By iambic shortening, `sīt` (L) can be scanned as `sĭt` **(S)**.\n\n**3. Assembling the Feet:**\n\nWith these principles, the quantity of the 14 syllables in the line is:\n`L (et) S (ti) S (bi) S (be) L (nes) S (se) L (sō) L (lī) L (quom) S (si) S (bi) S (sit) S (ma) S (le)`\n\nThe parsing into six feet is as follows, containing violations that are characteristic of Plautine meter:\n\n*   **Foot 1: `et ti bi`**\n    *   Scans as **L S S**. This is a Dactyl, a valid resolution for an Iamb in the first foot.\n\n*   **Foot 2: `be n'es se`**\n    *   Scans as **S L S**. This is a Cretic, a resolution allowed by Plautus in an even foot.\n\n*   **Foot 3: `sō lī`**\n    *   Scans as **L L**. This is a Spondee, a valid resolution in an odd foot.\n\n*   **Foot 4: `quom si bi`**\n    *   Scans as **L S S**. This is a Dactyl. A dactyl in an even-numbered foot (2, 4, 6) is a significant but known license in Plautus.\n\n*   **Foot 5: `sit ma le`**\n    *   This leaves five syllables for the last two feet, which is not possible. This indicates that one of the prior assumptions, while common, must be incorrect for this specific line. The line is notoriously difficult and subject to scholarly debate. A common alternative parsing that completes the line is to re-evaluate the feet.\n\nLet's retry the parsing with the same syllable quantities but a different foot division, accepting common Plautine licenses:\n\n*   **Foot 1: `et ti`**\n    *   Scans as **L S**. A Trochee. Allowed in an odd foot.\n\n*   **Foot 2: `bi be n'es-`**\n    *   Scans as **S S L**. An Anapest. A common resolution for an iamb.\n\n*   **Foot 3: `-se sō-`**\n    *   Scans as **S L**. An Iamb.\n\n*   **Foot 4: `-lī quom`**\n    *   Scans as **L L**. A Spondee. This is a violation in an even foot, but a documented one in Plautus.\n\n*   **Foot 5: `si bi sit`**\n    *   Scans as **S S S** (using the shortened `sit`). A Tribrach. A valid resolution for an iamb.\n\n*   **Foot 6: `ma le`**\n    *   Scans as **S S**. A Pyrrhic. A short final syllable is allowed to stand in a long position at the end of the line (*brevis in longo*), making the foot effectively S L.\n\nThis yields a complete, albeit complex, scansion of the line.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nL S S S L S L L L S S S S S\n\nL S S | S L S | L L | L S S | S S S\n\n*The above is a list of the quantities of each syllable in the line. Because there are multiple ways to divide this line into feet, each with its own metrical licenses, and no single scansion is universally agreed upon, the most direct and verifiable answer is the sequence of longs and shorts. However, presenting one of the plausible-yet-problematic divisions is standard practice for analysis.*\n\nA defensible scansion is:\n`L S S | S L S | L L | S S L | S L`\nThis version still doesn't account for all syllables, highlighting the notorious difficulty of this specific line.\n\nBased on a more consistent parse that uses all syllables:\n`L S | S S L | S L | L L | S S S | S S` (the final S acting as L)\n\nFinal scansion reflecting the analysis:\n\n<<<L S S S L S L L L S S S S S>>>"
