Here is a summary of the key residue hotspots on the human beta-1 subunit (isoform 1b, UniProt P25430) for its interaction with and modulation of the human Cav2.3 alpha-1 subunit.

**1) Hotspots for physical interaction with the alpha-1 subunit:**

These residues are located in the conserved AID-Binding Pocket (ABP), formed at the interface of the SH3 and GK-like domains, and are essential for establishing the physical connection to the alpha-1 subunit's I-II loop.

*   **Key Hydrophobic Groove Residues (from the GK domain):**
    *   **Leucine 359 (L359)**
    *   **Isoleucine 361 (I361)**
    *   **Leucine 427 (L427)**
    *   **Valine 432 (V432)**
    *   **Tryptophan 437 (W437)** (A critical anchor point)
*   **Key Polar/Electrostatic Interaction Residues (from the GK domain):**
    *   **Tyrosine 399 (Y399)**
    *   **Glutamate 395 (E395)**
    *   **Serine 401 (S401)**
    *   **Aspartate 429 (D429)**
*   **Key Pocket-Lining Residues (from the SH3 domain):**
    *   **Tyrosine 294 (Y294)**
    *   **Valine 305 (V305)**

**2) Hotspots for fine-tuning gating properties of the alpha-1 subunit:**

While all the interaction residues listed above are fundamentally required for the beta subunit's primary modulatory effects, specific fine-tuning is governed by variable regions outside the core interaction pocket.

*   **Fundamental Modulation:** The interaction hotspot residues listed in part (1) are all critical for gating modulation, as a stable interaction is the prerequisite for the beta subunit to influence the alpha-1 subunit.
*   **Fine-Tuning Modulation (Voltage-Dependence of Activation):** A specific segment in the variable N-terminus of the beta-1b subunit is responsible for causing a characteristic hyperpolarizing (leftward) shift in the voltage-dependence of activation. The key hotspots within this region are:
    *   **Region:** Approximately residues **28-57**
    *   **Key Residues:** A cluster of charged amino acids within this region.
        *   **Glutamate 39 (E39)**
        *   **Aspartate 41 (D41)**
        *   **Aspartate 42 (D42)**
        *   **Lysine 45 (K45)**
