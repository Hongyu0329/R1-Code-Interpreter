    "This problem requires us to find the number of distinct, syntactically valid boolean expressions of exactly 5 symbols that evaluate to True. The available symbols are T, F, !, &, |, (, ).\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the structure of a boolean expression\n\nA valid boolean expression of length 5 can be categorized by its top-level structure. Any valid expression `E` must be one of the following forms:\n1.  An operand (`T` or `F`). (Length 1, so not our case)\n2.  A parenthesized expression `(E')`.\n3.  A unary operation `!E'`.\n4.  A binary operation `E1 B E2`.\n\nWe will systematically list all possible valid 5-symbol structures based on these forms, and then for each structure, we'll count how many ways there are to substitute `T` and `F` for operands and `&` and `|` for binary operators to make the expression evaluate to `True`.\n\n### Step 2: Expressions of the form `(E')`\n\nThe expression has the form `(E')` where the length of sub-expression `E'` must be `5 - 2 = 3`. We need to find all valid 3-symbol expressions `E'`.\nValid expressions of length 3:\n*   `O B O'`: An operand, a binary operator, and another operand (e.g., `T&F`).\n*   `!!O`: A double negation of an operand (e.g., `!!T`).\n*   `!(O)`: A negation of a parenthesized operand (e.g., `!(T)`).\n*   `(!O)`: A parenthesized negated operand (e.g., `(!F)`).\n\nNow we form 5-symbol expressions and count the true ones:\n1.  **Form `(O B O')`**:\n    *   `B = &`: There are 4 possibilities (`(T&T), (T&F), (F&T), (F&F)`). Only `(T&T)` is True. (1)\n    *   `B = |`: There are 4 possibilities (`(T|T), (T|F), (F|T), (F|F)`). The first three are True. (3)\n    *   *Subtotal: 1 + 3 = 4*\n2.  **Form `(!!O)`**: `(!!T)` is True, `(!!F)` is False.\n    *   *Subtotal: 1*\n3.  **Form `(!(O))`**: `(!(T))` is False, `(!(F))` is True.\n    *   *Subtotal: 1*\n4.  **Form `((!O))`**: `((!T))` is False, `((!F))` is True.\n    *   *Subtotal: 1*\n\nTotal for `(E')` form: 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 7.\n\n### Step 3: Expressions of the form `!E'`\n\nThe expression has the form `!E'` where the total length is 5. `!` is one symbol, so `E'` must be a valid expression of 4 symbols. Due to operator precedence, if `E'` starts with another `!`, no parentheses are needed.\n1.  **Form `!!!!O`**: This is `!E'` where `E' = !!!O`. The expression `!!!!O` is 5 symbols.\n    *   `!!!!T` evaluates to T. (1)\n    *   `!!!!F` evaluates to F.\n    *   *Subtotal: 1*\n2.  **Form `!!(O)`**: This is `!E'` where `E' = !(O)`. The string `!!(O)` has 5 symbols (`!`, `!`, `(`, O, `)`).\n    *   `!!(T)` evaluates to T. (1)\n    *   `!!(F)` evaluates to F.\n    *   *Subtotal: 1*\n\nTotal for `!E'` form: 1 + 1 = 2.\n\n### Step 4: Expressions of the form `E1 B E2`\n\nThis is the most complex category. The structure is `E1 B E2`, where `B` is a binary operator, and there are no outer parentheses. The lengths of `E1` and `E2` must sum to 4. We check all possible combinations of structures and lengths for `E1` and `E2`.\n\n1.  **Three Operands**: Forms like `O B O' B' O''`. Precedence rules determine parsing.\n    *   `O | O' & O''`: Length 5. Parsed as `O | (O' & O'')`. This is True if `O=T` (4 ways for O', O'') or if `O=F` and `O'&O''=T` (1 way: `F|T&T`).\n        *   *Subtotal: 5*\n    *   `O' & O'' | O`: Length 5. Parsed as `(O' & O'') | O`. Symmetric to the above.\n        *   *Subtotal: 5*\n    *   `O & (O' | O'')`: Length 5. Parentheses are required to override precedence. True if `O=T` and `(O'|O'')=T`. There are 3 ways for `O'|O''` to be true.\n        *   *Subtotal: 3*\n    *   `(O | O') & O''`: Length 5. Symmetric to the above.\n        *   *Subtotal: 3*\n\n2.  **`!O B !O'`**: Length is 2+1+2=5. `L(E1)=2, L(E2)=2`.\n    *   `B = &`: Only `!F&!F` is True. (1)\n    *   `B = |`: `!T|!F`, `!F|!T`, `!F|!F` are True. (3)\n    *   *Subtotal: 4*\n\n3.  **Symmetric Forms (L=3, L=1)**: Like `E1 B O` and `O B E2` where `L(E1)` or `L(E2)` is 3.\n    *   `!!O B O'` and `O' B !!O`: (`(!!O) B O'`). For each form, `&` gives 1 True (`!!T&T`) and `|` gives 3 True (`!!T|T, !!F|T, !!T|F`).\n        *   *Subtotal: 4 + 4 = 8*\n    *   `!(O) B O'` and `O' B !(O)`: (`(!O) B O'`). For each form, `&` gives 1 True (`!(F)&T`) and `|` gives 3 True (`!(T)|T, !(F)|T, !(F)|F`).\n        *   *Subtotal: 4 + 4 = 8*\n\n4.  **Redundant Parentheses**: Forms like `(O) B O'`, where parens are used on a single operand.\n    *   `(O) B O'` and `O' B (O)`: (`O B O`). For each form, `&` gives 1 True (`(T)&T`) and `|` gives 3 True.\n        *   *Subtotal: 4 + 4 = 8*\n\nTotal for `E1 B E2` form: (5+5+3+3) + 4 + 8 + 8 + 8 = 16 + 4 + 24 = 44.\n\n### Step 5: Final Calculation\n\nSum the counts from all disjoint categories:\n*   From `(E')` forms: 7\n*   From `!E'` forms: 2\n*   From `E1 B E2` forms: 44\n\nTotal number of true expressions = 7 + 2 + 44 = 53.\n\nFinal check of all counted structures to ensure they are distinct strings and cover all possibilities. The structural breakdown (`(E')`, `!E'`, `E1BE2`) ensures no overlap between the main categories. Within each category, we have listed distinct string patterns. The total appears correct.\n\n<<<53>>>"
