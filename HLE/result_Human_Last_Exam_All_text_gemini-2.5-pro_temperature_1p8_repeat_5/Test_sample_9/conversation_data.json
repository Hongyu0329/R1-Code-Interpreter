    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the space $X$**\n\nA lattice $\\Lambda$ in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ is a discrete subgroup of rank 2. It can be represented by a basis, which consists of two linearly independent vectors $v_1, v_2 \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$. We can write this basis as a matrix $M = (v_1 | v_2) \\in \\mathrm{GL}(2, \\mathbb{R})$.\n\nTwo bases, represented by matrices $M_1$ and $M_2$, generate the same lattice if and only if one basis can be obtained from the other by an integer change of coordinates. This means there exists a matrix $A \\in \\mathrm{GL}(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ (the group of integer matrices with determinant $\\pm 1$) such that $M_2 = M_1 A$.\n\nThe set of all nondegenerate lattices is therefore the quotient space $\\mathrm{GL}(2, \\mathbb{R}) / \\mathrm{GL}(2, \\mathbb{Z})$. This is the space of all possible shapes of lattices.\n\nThe \"area\" of a lattice generated by the columns of a matrix $M$ is given by $|\\det(M)|$. This area is an invariant of the lattice, since if $M_2 = M_1 A$ with $A \\in \\mathrm{GL}(2, \\mathbb{Z})$, then $|\\det(M_2)| = |\\det(M_1)| |\\det(A)| = |\\det(M_1)|$ because $|\\det(A)|=1$.\n\nThe question asks for the moduli space of lattices with unit area. This means we are selecting the lattices from the total space whose area is 1. These correspond to the equivalence classes of matrices $M$ such that $|\\det(M)|=1$.\nLet $S_1 = \\{M \\in \\mathrm{GL}(2, \\mathbb{R}) \\mid |\\det(M)|=1\\}$.\nThen the space $X$ is the quotient space $X = S_1 / \\mathrm{GL}(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\n**Step 2: Simplify the description of $X$**\n\nThe set $S_1$ is the union of two disjoint connected components: $\\mathrm{SL}(2, \\mathbb{R}) = \\{M \\mid \\det(M)=1\\}$ and $\\{M \\mid \\det(M)=-1\\}$.\nThe group $\\mathrm{GL}(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ also has two components, determined by the sign of the determinant: $\\mathrm{SL}(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ (determinant 1) and matrices with determinant -1.\n\nLet's see how $\\mathrm{GL}(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ acts on $S_1$.\n- If $A \\in \\mathrm{SL}(2, \\mathbb{Z})$, it preserves each component of $S_1$.\n- If $A \\in \\mathrm{GL}(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ has $\\det(A)=-1$, it maps matrices with determinant 1 to matrices with determinant -1, and vice-versa. So, it swaps the two components of $S_1$.\n\nEvery orbit in $X = S_1 / \\mathrm{GL}(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ must contain an element from $\\mathrm{SL}(2, \\mathbb{R})$. To see this, let $[M] \\in X$. If $M \\in \\mathrm{SL}(2, \\mathbb{R})$, we are done. If $\\det(M)=-1$, we can choose some $A \\in \\mathrm{GL}(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ with $\\det(A)=-1$ (for example, $A=\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$). Then the matrix $M' = MA$ is in the same equivalence class as $M$, and $\\det(M') = \\det(M)\\det(A) = (-1)(-1)=1$, so $M' \\in \\mathrm{SL}(2, \\mathbb{R})$.\nThis means we can describe $X$ just by looking at the elements in $\\mathrm{SL}(2, \\mathbb{R})$.\n\nLet $M_1, M_2 \\in \\mathrm{SL}(2, \\mathbb{R})$. When do they represent the same point in $X$?\n$[M_1] = [M_2]$ in $X$ means that there exists an $A \\in \\mathrm{GL}(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ such that $M_2=M_1 A$.\nTaking determinants, we have $\\det(M_2) = \\det(M_1)\\det(A)$, which is $1=1\\cdot\\det(A)$.\nThis implies $\\det(A)=1$, so $A$ must be in $\\mathrm{SL}(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\nTherefore, two elements in $\\mathrm{SL}(2, \\mathbb{R})$ define the same lattice in $X$ if and only if they are in the same orbit under the action of $\\mathrm{SL}(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\nThis establishes a bijection between $X$ and the space $\\mathrm{SL}(2, \\mathbb{R}) / \\mathrm{SL}(2, \\mathbb{Z})$. This bijection can be shown to be a homeomorphism. So, we have identified the space $X$:\n$X \\cong \\mathrm{SL}(2, \\mathbb{R}) / \\mathrm{SL}(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\nThis space is sometimes referred to as the moduli space of oriented unit-area lattices, or the unit tangent bundle of the modular orbifold. The crucial point is that in this context, \"moduli space of lattices\" without further qualifiers leads to this space.\n\n**Step 3: Compute $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z})$**\n\nWe need to compute $H_1(\\mathrm{SL}(2, \\mathbb{R}) / \\mathrm{SL}(2, \\mathbb{Z}), \\mathbb{Z})$.\nBy the Hurewicz theorem, $H_1(Y, \\mathbb{Z})$ is the abelianization of the fundamental group $\\pi_1(Y)$.\nLet $G = \\mathrm{SL}(2, \\mathbb{R})$ and $\\Gamma = \\mathrm{SL}(2, \\mathbb{Z})$. The space $X$ is the orbit space $G/\\Gamma$.\nA standard result in the theory of Lie groups and arithmetic subgroups states that for certain $G$ and $\\Gamma$, the homology of the quotient space $G/\\Gamma$ is isomorphic to the group homology of $\\Gamma$. In particular, for $G=\\mathrm{SL}(2,\\mathbb{R})$ and $\\Gamma = \\mathrm{SL}(2, \\mathbb{Z})$, an arithmetic group whose virtual cohomological dimension is 1, the isomorphism holds for the first homology group:\n$H_1(\\mathrm{SL}(2, \\mathbb{R})/\\mathrm{SL}(2, \\mathbb{Z}), \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong H_1(\\mathrm{SL}(2, \\mathbb{Z}), \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\nThe first group homology $H_1(\\Gamma, \\mathbb{Z})$ is by definition the abelianization of the group $\\Gamma$, denoted $\\Gamma_{ab}$.\nSo our task reduces to finding the abelianization of $\\mathrm{SL}(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\n**Step 4: The abelianization of $\\mathrm{SL}(2, \\mathbb{Z})$**\n\nThe group $\\mathrm{SL}(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ is generated by the matrices:\n$S = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$ and $T = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nA standard presentation for $\\mathrm{SL}(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ in terms of these generators is given by the relations:\n$S^4 = I$ and $(ST)^3 = S^2$. (Note: $I$ is the identity matrix).\n\nTo find the abelianization, we add the commutation relation $ST=TS$. Let $s$ and $t$ be the images of $S$ and $T$ in the abelianized group. The group operation is now written additively. The relations become:\n1. $4s = 0$\n2. $3(s+t) = 2s$\n\nFrom the second relation, we have $3s + 3t = 2s$, which simplifies to $s + 3t = 0$, or $s = -3t$.\n\nNow substitute this into the first relation:\n$4(-3t) = 0 \\implies -12t = 0 \\implies 12t=0$.\n\nAny element in the abelianized group can be written as a combination of $s$ and $t$, say $ks+lt$. Using $s=-3t$, this becomes $k(-3t)+lt = (l-3k)t$. Thus, the group is cyclic and generated by $t$. The only relation is $12t=0$.\nThis means the abelianized group is the cyclic group of order 12.\n$H_1(\\mathrm{SL}(2, \\mathbb{Z}), \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathrm{SL}(2, \\mathbb{Z})_{ab} \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/12\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nTherefore, $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/12\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nFinal Answer should be provided directly as per instruction."
