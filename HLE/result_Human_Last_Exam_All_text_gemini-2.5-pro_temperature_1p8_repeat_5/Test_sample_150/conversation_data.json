    "An elegant explanation of the method, followed by the method itself.\n\n### Step-by-step analysis of the question and the provided code\n\n1.  **Analyze the Problem:**\n    *   The program needs to process `n` statements.\n    *   An integer variable, `x`, starts at `0`.\n    *   There are four possible statements: `\"++X\"`, `\"X++\"`, `\"--X\"`, `\"X--\"`.\n    *   Statements with `++` increment `x` by 1.\n    *   Statements with `--` decrement `x` by 1.\n    *   The goal is to find the final value of `x` after executing all `n` statements.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Submitted Java Program:**\n    *   The code initializes `tresult` (representing `x`) to 0, which is correct.\n    *   It loops `n` times to read each statement.\n    *   Inside the loop, it uses `test.contains(\"++X\")` to check for an increment. This is flawed because it will miss the `\"X++\"` case.\n    *   Similarly, it uses `test.contains(\"--X\")` to check for a decrement, which will miss the `\"X--\"` case.\n    *   Because the code does not handle all valid input formats, it will produce the wrong answer for any program containing `\"X++\"` or `\"X--\"`.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The provided program does not solve the problem correctly. The answer must start with 'N'.\n\n3.  **Devise an Efficient C Solution:**\n    The next step is to design a C program that is both fast (minimal character comparisons) and memory-efficient.\n\n    *   **Logic:** A key observation is that all valid statements (`++X`, `X++`, `--X`, `X--`) are three characters long. More importantly, the character at the middle position (index 1) uniquely identifies the operation.\n        *   `++X`: The character at index 1 is `+`.\n        *   `X++`: The character at index 1 is `+`.\n        *   `--X`: The character at index 1 is `-`.\n        *   `X--`: The character at index 1 is `-`.\n    *   Therefore, we only need to read the input statement and check the character at index 1. If it's `+`, we increment our counter. Otherwise, it must be `-`, so we decrement. This requires only one character comparison per statement.\n\n4.  **Calculate Performance Metrics for `n=100`:**\n    Now, let's quantify the efficiency of this optimal approach for an input size of `n=100`. The question asks for `x+y`, where `x` is the character comparison count and `y` is the memory usage.\n\n    *   **`x` (Smallest Number of Character Comparisons):**\n        *   Our optimal logic performs exactly one comparison (`if character is '+'`) for each of the `n` statements.\n        *   For `n=100` statements, the total number of comparisons is `100 * 1 = 100`.\n        *   This is the minimum possible, as we must inspect the input in some way to determine the operation.\n        *   Therefore, `x = 100`.\n\n    *   **`y` (Smallest Memory Size in Bytes):**\n        *   To implement this logic, we need to store the state.\n        *   A variable to hold the final value: `int x;` (typically 4 bytes).\n        *   A variable to hold the number of statements from the first line of input: `int n;` (typically 4 bytes).\n        *   We can read the input character-by-character to avoid allocating a larger string buffer. An implementation using `getchar()` would read and discard the first character, read the second character for the comparison, and then discard the third character and the newline. This approach avoids needing a buffer variable.\n        *   The minimal set of variables required is one `int` for `n` and one `int` for `x`.\n        *   Total memory: `sizeof(int) + sizeof(int) = 4 + 4 = 8` bytes.\n        *   Therefore, `y = 8`.\n\n5.  **Final Answer Formulation:**\n    The final answer must be in the format `Nx+y`.\n    *   `N` because the provided program is incorrect.\n    *   `x = 100`\n    *   `y = 8`\n    *   Combining these gives `N100+8`.\n\n<<<N100+8>>>"
