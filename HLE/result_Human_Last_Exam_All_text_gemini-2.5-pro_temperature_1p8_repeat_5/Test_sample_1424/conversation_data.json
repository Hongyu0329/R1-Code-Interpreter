    "This analysis breaks down the problem of finding the functional dependence of the bare Green's function on single-particle energy eigenvalues within the Feynman path integral formalism.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Define the Bare Green's Function ($G_0$)**\n\nThe Green's function, in general, is a propagator. It describes the amplitude for a particle (or excitation) to travel from one spacetime point to another. The \"bare\" or \"non-interacting\" Green's function, denoted as $G_0$, specifically describes this propagation in a system without any particle-particle interactions. The system is governed by a single-particle Hamiltonian, $H_0$, whose eigenstates $|k\\rangle$ have corresponding energy eigenvalues $\\epsilon_k$.\n\nIn the language of second quantization, the Feynman (time-ordered) Green's function is defined as the ground state expectation value of the time-ordered product of field operators:\n$iG_0(x_2, t_2; x_1, t_1) = \\langle \\Phi_0 | T[\\psi(x_2, t_2) \\psi^\\dagger(x_1, t_1)] | \\Phi_0 \\rangle$\nwhere $|\\Phi_0\\rangle$ is the non-interacting many-body ground state, and $T$ is the time-ordering operator.\n\n**Step 2: Represent $G_0$ using the Path Integral**\n\nThe Feynman path integral formalism provides a way to calculate such expectation values by summing over all possible field configurations (\"paths\") weighted by the action of the system. The generating functional for a non-interacting fermionic system is:\n$Z_0[J] = \\int \\mathcal{D}[\\bar{\\psi}, \\psi] \\exp\\left( i S_0[\\bar{\\psi}, \\psi] + i \\int d^4x (\\bar{J}\\psi + \\bar{\\psi}J) \\right)$\nwhere $S_0$ is the action for the non-interacting system. The Green's function can then be obtained by taking functional derivatives with respect to the source terms $J$ and $\\bar{J}$.\n\nCrucially, the non-interacting action $S_0$ is quadratic in the fields. A general form for the action is:\n$S_0 = \\int dt \\int d^3x \\, \\bar{\\psi}(x,t) (i\\hbar\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} - H_0) \\psi(x,t)$\nwhere $H_0$ is the single-particle Hamiltonian operator.\n\n**Step 3: Move to the Energy-Momentum Representation**\n\nThe functional dependence on $\\epsilon_k$ becomes most transparent in the energy-momentum basis (i.e., after Fourier transforming from spacetime coordinates $(x,t)$ to momentum-frequency coordinates $(k, \\omega)$).\n\n1.  **Transform the fields**:\n    $\\psi(x,t) = \\int \\frac{d^3k}{(2\\pi)^3} \\int \\frac{d\\omega}{2\\pi} e^{i(k \\cdot x - \\omega t)} \\psi(k, \\omega)$\n\n2.  **Transform the action**: The derivative operators become algebraic multipliers: $i\\hbar\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\rightarrow \\hbar\\omega$. The Hamiltonian operator $H_0$, when acting on a momentum eigenstate, gives the energy eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$. For a free particle, for example, $H_0 = -\\frac{\\hbar^2 \\nabla^2}{2m}$, so $\\epsilon_k = \\frac{\\hbar^2 k^2}{2m}$.\n\n3.  **The Action in Fourier Space**: Substituting these into the action gives:\n    $S_0 = \\int \\frac{d^3k}{(2\\pi)^3} \\int \\frac{d\\omega}{2\\pi} \\, \\bar{\\psi}(k, \\omega) (\\hbar\\omega - \\epsilon_k) \\psi(k, \\omega)$\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Green's Function as the Inverse of the Action's Kernel**\n\nIn the path integral formalism, for a quadratic action of the form $S = \\int \\bar{\\psi} \\mathcal{O} \\psi$, the propagator (Green's function) is the inverse of the operator $\\mathcal{O}$.\n\nFrom our action in Fourier space, we can directly identify the kernel:\n$\\mathcal{O}(k, \\omega) = \\hbar\\omega - \\epsilon_k$\n\nTherefore, the Green's function $G_0(k, \\omega)$ is the inverse of this expression:\n$G_0(k, \\omega) = [\\mathcal{O}(k, \\omega)]^{-1} = \\frac{1}{\\hbar\\omega - \\epsilon_k}$\n\n**Step 5: Incorporate Causality (The $i\\eta$ Prescription)**\n\nThe expression derived in Step 4 has a pole on the real frequency axis at $\\hbar\\omega = \\epsilon_k$. To handle this singularity and ensure that the propagator correctly describes cause-and-effect (i.e., is causal), the path integral requires a specific prescription for how to evaluate the integrals. This is physically equivalent to selecting the correct vacuum state (the Feynman vacuum).\n\nThis prescription manifests as adding a small, infinitesimal imaginary part, denoted $\\pm i\\eta$ (or $\\pm i\\delta$, where $\\eta \\to 0^+$), to the denominator. This shifts the pole slightly off the real axis.\n\n*   For states that are empty in the ground state (particle states, $\\epsilon_k > \\epsilon_F$), the pole is shifted to $\\epsilon_k - i\\eta$.\n*   For states that are occupied in the ground state (hole states, $\\epsilon_k < \\epsilon_F$), the pole is shifted to $\\epsilon_k + i\\eta$.\n\nThis leads to the final, complete expression for the bare Feynman Green's function:\n$G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\hbar\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\eta \\, \\text{sgn}(\\epsilon_k - \\epsilon_F)}$\nwhere $\\epsilon_F$ is the Fermi energy and $\\text{sgn}$ is the sign function.\n\nAlternatively, this is often written as two separate parts:\n$G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1 - n_k^0}{\\hbar\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\eta} + \\frac{n_k^0}{\\hbar\\omega - \\epsilon_k - i\\eta}$\nwhere $n_k^0 = \\Theta(\\epsilon_F - \\epsilon_k)$ is the occupation number (0 or 1) of the state $|k\\rangle$ in the zero-temperature ground state.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n1.  **Representation Matters**: The simple inverse relationship is only apparent in the energy-momentum (or frequency-k) representation. In real spacetime, the dependence is a complex superposition involving exponentials and eigenfunctions: $G_0(x,t; x',t') \\propto \\sum_k \\psi_k(x)\\psi_k^*(x')e^{-i\\epsilon_k(t-t')/\\hbar}$.\n2.  **Origin of $i\\eta$**: This is not an ad-hoc addition but a crucial part of the path integral's definition to ensure convergence and causality. It defines the contour of integration in the complex energy plane.\n3.  **Poles are Physical**: The key takeaway is that the poles of the Green's function in the complex energy plane correspond directly to the energy eigenvalues of the system's excitations. For $G_0$, these are the single-particle energies $\\epsilon_k$.\n4.  **Inverse Relationship**: The most direct way to state the functional dependence in the path integral language is that $G_0$ is the inverse of the kernel of the quadratic action, and this kernel is linear in $\\epsilon_k$: $(\\hbar\\omega - \\epsilon_k)$.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nIn the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function $G_0$ is derived from the non-interacting action $S_0$. In the energy-momentum representation $(k, \\omega)$, the functional dependence of $G_0(k, \\omega)$ on the single-particle energy eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$ is an inverse relationship. The Green's function is the inverse of the quadratic kernel of the action, which is $(\\hbar\\omega - \\epsilon_k)$. Including the necessary causality prescription, the full functional form is:\n\n$G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\hbar\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\eta \\, \\text{sgn}(\\epsilon_k - \\epsilon_F)}$\n\nThe poles of the Green's function in the complex $\\omega$-plane occur precisely at the single-particle energies $\\epsilon_k$ (shifted infinitesimally).\n\n<<<The functional dependence of the bare Green's function $G_0$ on the single-particle energy eigenvalues $\\epsilon_k$ is an inverse relationship. In the energy-momentum representation, the Green's function $G_0(k, \\omega)$ is proportional to $(\\hbar\\omega - \\epsilon_k)^{-1}$, with a specific infinitesimal imaginary part added to the denominator to ensure causality.>>>"
