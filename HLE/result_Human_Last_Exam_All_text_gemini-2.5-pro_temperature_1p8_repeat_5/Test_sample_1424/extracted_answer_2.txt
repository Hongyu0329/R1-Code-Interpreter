The functional dependence of the bare Green's function $G_0$ on the single-particle energy eigenvalues $\epsilon_k$ is an inverse relationship. In the energy-momentum representation, the Green's function $G_0(k, \omega)$ is proportional to $(\hbar\omega - \epsilon_k)^{-1}$, with a specific infinitesimal imaginary part added to the denominator to ensure causality.
