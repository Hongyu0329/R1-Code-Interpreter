    "This question asks for the number of types of stable reductions of a genus 4 curve, given that its Jacobian has good reduction. This problem can be broken down into three main steps based on key theorems in arithmetic geometry.\n\n**Step 1: The structure of the stable reduction's dual graph**\nLet C be a curve of genus g defined over a valuation field K. The Jacobian variety of C is J(C). The condition that J(C) has good reduction is a very strong constraint on the structure of the stable reduction of C. Let the special fiber of the stable model of C be denoted by $C_k$. According to a fundamental result by Raynaud (and Deligne-Mumford), the Jacobian J(C) has good reduction if and only if the dual graph of $C_k$ is a tree. The dual graph, $\\Gamma(C_k)$, has vertices corresponding to the irreducible components of $C_k$ and edges corresponding to the nodes where these components intersect.\n\n**Step 2: The arithmetic genus formula**\nThe arithmetic genus of a stable curve $C_k$ is given by the Deligne-Mumford formula:\n$p_a(C_k) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} g_i + \\delta - n + 1$\nwhere:\n*   $n$ is the number of irreducible components.\n*   $g_i$ is the geometric genus of the i-th component.\n*   $\\delta$ is the number of nodes (singularities).\n\nThe arithmetic genus of the special fiber is equal to the genus of the generic fiber, so $p_a(C_k) = g = 4$.\nThe quantity $\\delta - n + 1$ is the first Betti number, $b_1(\\Gamma(C_k))$, of the dual graph.\nSince the dual graph $\\Gamma(C_k)$ is a tree, its first Betti number is 0. For a connected graph (which a tree is), this means the number of edges ($\\delta$) is one less than the number of vertices ($n$), i.e., $\\delta = n-1$.\nSubstituting this into the genus formula:\n$4 = p_a(C_k) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} g_i + (n-1) - n + 1 = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} g_i$.\nThis simplifies the problem significantly: we need to find configurations of components whose geometric genera sum to 4.\n\n**Step 3: The stability condition and enumeration**\nA stable curve must satisfy certain conditions. For a stable reduction whose dual graph is a tree:\n1.  Each irreducible component $C_i$ is a smooth curve.\n2.  If a component $C_i$ has geometric genus $g_i = 0$ (i.e., it's a rational curve, $\\mathbb{P}^1$), it must be connected to the other components at 3 or more points (nodes). In the dual graph, this means the corresponding vertex must have degree at least 3.\n3.  If a component $C_i$ has geometric genus $g_i = 1$ (an elliptic curve), it must be connected at 1 or more points. For a tree with more than one vertex, every vertex has degree at least 1, so this condition is automatically satisfied.\n4.  Components with genus $g_i \\ge 2$ have no stability-related degree conditions.\n\nA \"type\" of stable reduction corresponds to a unique isomorphism class of a dual graph (a tree) whose vertices are labeled by the genera of the components, satisfying the above conditions. We can classify these types by the number of rational components (denoted by k, where g=0).\n\n**Case-by-case Analysis:**\n\n*   **k=0 rational components:** All component genera $g_i \\ge 1$. The sum $\\sum g_i = 4$.\n    1.  Partition {4}: One component of genus 4. The dual graph is a single point. **(1 type)**\n    2.  Partition {3, 1}: A genus 3 and a genus 1 component. The graph is two vertices connected by an edge. **(1 type)**\n    3.  Partition {2, 2}: Two genus 2 components. The graph is two vertices connected by an edge. **(1 type)**\n    4.  Partition {2, 1, 1}: One genus 2 and two genus 1 components. The graph is a path on 3 vertices. There are two distinct labelings: (1)-(2)-(1) and (2)-(1)-(1). **(2 types)**\n    5.  Partition {1, 1, 1, 1}: Four genus 1 components. There are two non-isomorphic trees on 4 vertices: a path ($P_4$) and a star ($K_{1,3}$). **(2 types)**\n    Total for k=0: 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = **7 types**.\n\n*   **k=1 rational component:** One component has g=0 and needs degree $\\ge 3$. The sum of the other positive genera is 4.\n    6.  Partition of 4 is {2, 1, 1}. Total components are {2, 1, 1, 0} (n=4). The tree must have a vertex of degree $\\ge 3$, which forces it to be the star graph $K_{1,3}$. The genus 0 component must be the central vertex (degree 3). The leaves (degree 1) are the components of genus 2, 1, and 1. This is a valid configuration. **(1 type)**\n    7.  Partition of 4 is {1, 1, 1, 1}. Total components {1, 1, 1, 1, 0} (n=5). We need a tree on 5 vertices with a vertex of degree $\\ge 3$. There are two such trees: one with max degree 3, and the star graph $K_{1,4}$ with max degree 4. In each case, the genus 0 component is placed at the high-degree vertex, and the four genus 1 components are placed at the remaining vertices. Both are valid. **(2 types)**\n    Total for k=1: 1 + 2 = **3 types**.\n\n*   **k=2 rational components:** Two components have g=0 and need degree $\\ge 3$. The sum of other positive genera is 4.\n    8.  Partition of 4 is {1, 1, 1, 1}. Total components {1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0} (n=6). We need a tree on 6 vertices with at least two vertices of degree $\\ge 3$. The only such tree has a degree sequence of (3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1) (two central nodes connected, each with two leaf nodes). The two genus 0 components must be placed at the two vertices of degree 3. The four genus 1 components are the leaves. This is a valid configuration. **(1 type)**\n    Total for k=2: **1 type**.\n\n*   **k â‰¥ 3 rational components:** This would require a tree with at least 3 vertices of degree $\\ge 3$. A simple argument on the sum of degrees of a tree shows that this is impossible if the total sum of genera is 4. For k rational components among m non-rational ones, the inequality $k \\le m-2$ must hold, which prevents k from being 3 or higher when $\\sum g_i = 4$.\n\n**Final Count:**\nAdding up the counts from each case:\n7 (for k=0) + 3 (for k=1) + 1 (for k=2) = 11.\n\nThere are 11 distinct types of stable reductions for a genus 4 curve whose Jacobian has good reduction.\n\n<<<11>>>"
