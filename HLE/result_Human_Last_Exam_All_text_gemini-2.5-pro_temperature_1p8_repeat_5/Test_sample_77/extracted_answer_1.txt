No, the simulation would likely fail because one of the key components would not function as required. A "plane" has no thickness or volume, and fluid particles in the simulation would likely pass directly through it as if it were not there. This phenomenon is known as leaking or tunneling. For an obstacle to work correctly in a fluid simulation, it must have a non-zero thickness.
