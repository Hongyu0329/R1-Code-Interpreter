    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the value of the integral.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the integrand**\nThe integral is given by $I = \\int_{0}^{\\infty}\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\log\\left(\\cos\\frac{x}{2^{n}}\\right)\\mathrm{d}x$.\nThe integrand is $f(x) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\log\\left(\\cos\\frac{x}{2^{n}}\\right)$.\nThe logarithm function $\\log(z)$ is defined for any non-zero complex number $z$. If $z$ is a positive real number, $\\log(z)$ is real. If $z$ is a negative real number, e.g., $z=-a$ where $a>0$, its principal value is $\\log(-a) = \\log(a) + i\\pi$.\n\nFor a given real $x$, the term $\\cos\\frac{x}{2^{n}}$ can be positive, negative, or zero.\n- If $\\cos\\frac{x}{2^{n}} > 0$, $\\log\\left(\\cos\\frac{x}{2^{n}}\\right)$ is a real number.\n- If $\\cos\\frac{x}{2^{n}} < 0$, $\\log\\left(\\cos\\frac{x}{2^{n}}\\right)$ is a complex number.\n- If $\\cos\\frac{x}{2^{n}} = 0$, the logarithm is undefined. This occurs when $x/2^n = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + k\\pi$ for some integer $k$. The integral is an improper integral, so we can assume the domain of integration avoids these points.\n\nSince the final answer to \"what is the value\" is expected to be a single number (typically real), this suggests we should investigate the real part of the integral.\n\n**Step 2: Simplify the summation in the integrand**\nWe use the well-known infinite product expansion for the sine function, which arises from the repeated application of the sine double angle formula:\n$$ \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\cos\\left(\\frac{x}{2^n}\\right) = \\cos\\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)\\cos\\left(\\frac{x}{4}\\right)\\cos\\left(\\frac{x}{8}\\right)\\cdots = \\frac{\\sin x}{x} $$\nThis identity holds for complex numbers as well.\n\nTaking the logarithm of both sides, we get:\n$$ \\log\\left(\\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\cos\\left(\\frac{x}{2^n}\\right)\\right) = \\log\\left(\\frac{\\sin x}{x}\\right) $$\nUsing the property of logarithms, $\\log(ab) = \\log(a)+\\log(b)$, we can write:\n$$ \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\log\\left(\\cos\\frac{x}{2^{n}}\\right) = \\log\\left(\\frac{\\sin x}{x}\\right) $$\nThis relation holds true in the complex plane, possibly up to a multiple of $2\\pi i$. For our purpose, let's take the real part of both sides.\nThe real part of a sum is the sum of the real parts: $\\text{Re}\\left(\\sum z_n\\right) = \\sum \\text{Re}(z_n)$.\nThe real part of the logarithm is the logarithm of the absolute value: $\\text{Re}(\\log z) = \\log|z|$.\n\nSo, the real part of the integrand is:\n$$ \\text{Re}\\left(\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\log\\left(\\cos\\frac{x}{2^{n}}\\right)\\right) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\text{Re}\\left(\\log\\left(\\cos\\frac{x}{2^{n}}\\right)\\right) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\log\\left|\\cos\\frac{x}{2^{n}}\\right| $$\nThis can be written as:\n$$ \\log\\left(\\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\left|\\cos\\frac{x}{2^{n}}\\right|\\right) = \\log\\left|\\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\cos\\frac{x}{2^{n}}\\right| = \\log\\left|\\frac{\\sin x}{x}\\right| $$\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the transformed integral**\nThe problem is now reduced to finding the real part of the original integral.\n$$ \\text{Re}(I) = \\text{Re}\\left(\\int_{0}^{\\infty}\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\log\\left(\\cos\\frac{x}{2^{n}}\\right)\\mathrm{d}x\\right) $$\nSince the integral of the real part of a complex function is the real part of the integral, we have:\n$$ \\text{Re}(I) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty}\\text{Re}\\left(\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\log\\left(\\cos\\frac{x}{2^{n}}\\right)\\right)\\mathrm{d}x $$\nUsing the result from Step 2, this becomes:\n$$ \\text{Re}(I) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\log\\left|\\frac{\\sin x}{x}\\right| \\mathrm{d}x $$\nThis is a standard definite integral, although its evaluation is non-trivial. The value of this integral is a known result in mathematical analysis.\n\n**Step 4: The value of the definite integral**\nThe integral $\\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\log\\left|\\frac{\\sin x}{x}\\right| \\mathrm{d}x$ can be evaluated using various advanced techniques, such as contour integration or properties of the Gamma function, or parameter differentiation tricks.\nFor example, it can be related to the Dirichlet integral $\\int_0^\\infty \\frac{\\sin x}{x} dx = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$ and the sinc-squared integral $\\int_0^\\infty \\left(\\frac{\\sin x}{x}\\right)^2 dx = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\nThe value of this integral is known to be:\n$$ \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\log\\left|\\frac{\\sin x}{x}\\right| \\mathrm{d}x = -\\frac{\\pi}{2} $$\nAssuming the question is well-posed and seeks a real value, this is our answer. The imaginary part of the integral can be shown to be ill-defined or zero under certain interpretations, but the real part is robust.\n\nFinal conclusion: By interpreting the question as asking for the real value of the integral, we simplify the integrand and arrive at a known definite integral, whose value is $-\\frac{\\pi}{2}$."
