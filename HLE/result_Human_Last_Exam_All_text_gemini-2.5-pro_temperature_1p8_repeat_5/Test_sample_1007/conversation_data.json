    "**Step-by-Step Analysis of Each Ballet Step:**\n\n1.  **A. Entrechat six:**\n    *   **Starting Position:** Typically begins in the fifth position, for example, with the right foot in front of the left.\n    *   **Movement:** This is a vertical jump. The name *entrechat* refers to the interweaving or beating of the legs in the air, and \"six\" refers to the six distinct movements of the legs (three openings and three closings). An even-numbered *entrechat* (like *quatre*, *six*, *huit*) starts and lands on two feet. For an *entrechat six* starting with the right foot front, the sequence of beats in the air is: back, front, back. The dancer then lands.\n    *   **Ending Position:** After the three beats, the legs land back in the fifth position with the **same foot in front** as the starting position. The full cycle of beats returns the legs to their original configuration.\n    *   **Careful Point:** It is the even number of the *entrechat* combined with the specific sequence of beats that ensures the return to the original position. Odd-numbered *entrechats* land on one foot.\n\n2.  **B. Échappé battu changé:**\n    *   **Starting Position:** Begins in a closed position, usually the fifth position.\n    *   **Movement:** The word *échappé* means \"escaped,\" referring to the legs jumping from a closed position to an open one (second or fourth position). *Battu* means \"beaten,\" indicating a beat of the legs occurs. Most importantly, *changé* means \"changed.\"\n    *   **Ending Position:** After jumping to the open position, the dancer jumps back to the fifth position, but the word *changé* explicitly dictates that the feet must **change places**. If the right foot started in front, the left foot will end in front.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The term *changé* is the key indicator. If the step were an *échappé sans changer* (without changing), the feet would return to the original position, but that is not the step listed.\n\n3.  **C. Assemblé:**\n    *   **Starting Position:** Can begin from various positions, but a common starting point is the fifth position.\n    *   **Movement:** *Assemblé* means \"to assemble.\" The dancer brushes one leg out, pushes off the supporting leg, and then \"assembles\" both legs together in the air before landing on both feet simultaneously in the fifth position.\n    *   **Ending Position:** The final position depends on the type of *assemblé*. In an *assemblé dessus* (over), the working leg from the back lands in front, thus changing the feet. In an *assemblé dessous* (under), the working leg from the front lands in the back, also changing the feet. While it's possible to execute an *assemblé* that doesn't change feet, many common forms of the step do involve a change.\n    *   **Careful Point:** Unlike *entrechat six*, the name *assemblé* by itself does not guarantee the feet will return to the same position. The context or a further descriptor (*dessus*, *dessous*, *changé*) is usually needed, and these often imply a change.\n\n4.  **D. Glissade derrière:**\n    *   **Starting Position:** Usually fifth position. Let's assume the right foot is in front.\n    *   **Movement:** *Glissade* means \"to glide.\" *Derrière* means \"behind\" and refers to the action of the closing foot. In a *glissade* to the side, one foot glides out, weight is transferred, and the other foot glides in to close. For *glissade derrière*, the second foot closes *behind* the first in the fifth position. If we perform a *glissade* to the left (starting with the right foot front), the left (back) foot glides out, and the right (front) foot closes *behind* the left foot.\n    *   **Ending Position:** The result is the left foot is now in front. The feet have **changed** positions.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The terms *devant* (front) and *derrière* (behind) in a *glissade* describe how the second foot closes in relation to the first, and this action typically results in a change of feet. A *glissade* that does not change feet is specifically called a *glissade sans changer*.\n\n5.  **E. Gargouillade:**\n    *   **Starting Position:** Typically fifth position.\n    *   **Movement:** This is a decorative jumping step. It is similar to a *pas de chat* but with a double *rond de jambe* in the air. The first leg does a *rond de jambe en l'air en dehors* (outward circle) and the second leg does a *rond de jambe en l'air en dedans* (inward circle).\n    *   **Ending Position:** The step generally ends with the dancer landing in the fifth position, but with the feet **changed** from the starting position.\n    *   **Careful Point:** This is a step of transition and flourish, and like many such steps, it facilitates a change of weight and position to flow into the next movement.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nAfter analyzing each step, the only one that is defined to end in the exact same starting leg position (including which foot is front) is the **Entrechat six**. All other steps listed either explicitly state a change (*changé*), or their standard execution results in a change of feet (*glissade derrière*, *gargouillade*, and common forms of *assemblé*).\n\n<<<A>>>"
