Yes, changing the structure to incorporate a PEG group would likely solve the precipitation problem. The original probe's low solubility is caused by its large hydrophobic regions, specifically the thioxanthenone core and the 6-chlorohexyl chain. A PEG (polyethylene glycol) chain is highly hydrophilic and is commonly used to increase the aqueous solubility of hydrophobic molecules. By replacing the hydrophobic 6-chlorohexyl group with a hydrophilic PEG chain, the overall water solubility of the probe would be significantly enhanced, preventing it from precipitating out of the cell culture medium at the desired concentration.
