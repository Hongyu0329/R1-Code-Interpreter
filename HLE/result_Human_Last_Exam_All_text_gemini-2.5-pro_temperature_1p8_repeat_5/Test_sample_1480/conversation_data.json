    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rule activation level.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\nThe question asks for the \"rule activation level\" of a fuzzy rule. In a fuzzy logic system, a rule has an antecedent (the \"IF\" part) and a consequent (the \"THEN\" part). The process of inference involves:\n1.  **Fuzzification:** Converting crisp inputs to fuzzy sets.\n2.  **Antecedent Evaluation:** Calculating the \"firing level\" or \"firing strength\" of each rule based on the inputs. The question gives this value as `Phi_k(x′) = 0.7`.\n3.  **Implication (or Rule Activation):** Applying the firing level from the antecedent to the consequent fuzzy set. This step determines the output fuzzy set for each rule. This is the step we need to perform.\n4.  **Aggregation:** Combining the output fuzzy sets from all rules.\n5.  **Defuzzification:** Converting the final aggregated fuzzy set back to a crisp output.\n\nThe \"rule activation level\" corresponds to the result of the implication step.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Given Information and Operation**\n*   **Antecedent Firing Level:** `Phi_k(x′) = 0.7`. This scalar value represents the degree to which the IF part of the rule is true for the given input `x'`.\n*   **Consequent Membership Grade:** `μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9`. This is the membership grade of a specific output value `y_j` in the consequent fuzzy set `G_k_j` of the rule.\n*   **Operation:** A **t-norm** operation is specified. In fuzzy logic, the implication step is modeled using a t-norm that combines the antecedent's firing level with the consequent's membership function.\n\n**Step 3: Formulate the Calculation**\nThe activation level `A` for a given point in the consequent is calculated as:\n`A = t-norm(Antecedent Firing Level, Consequent Membership Grade)`\n`A = t-norm(Phi_k(x′), μG_k_j(y_j))`\n`A = t-norm(0.7, 0.9)`\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **The meaning of \"Interval Type-3 Fuzzy Set\":** The question mentions an \"interval type-3 fuzzy set\" (IT3 FS). In a full IT3 Fuzzy Logic System, the firing level `Phi_k(x′)` would not be a single number but a more complex interval type-2 fuzzy set. Similarly, the membership `μG_k_j(y_j)` would also be an IT2 FS. The calculation would involve a t-norm between these two IT2 fuzzy sets, which is a complex operation. However, the question provides simple scalar values (0.7 and 0.9). This indicates a significant simplification, where we are likely being asked to demonstrate the fundamental principle of fuzzy implication using representative values (perhaps the upper bounds of the respective fuzzy sets). We should proceed by applying the t-norm to these given scalar values.\n\n2.  **The Choice of T-norm:** The question generically says \"a t-norm operation\" without specifying which one. There are several types of t-norms. The most common ones used in fuzzy systems are:\n    *   **Minimum (Mamdani) t-norm:** `t(a, b) = min(a, b)`\n    *   **Product (Larsen) t-norm:** `t(a, b) = a * b`\n    *   **Łukasiewicz t-norm:** `t(a, b) = max(0, a + b - 1)`\n\n    In the absence of a specific instruction, the **Minimum t-norm** is the most standard and widely used choice for the implication step in fuzzy controllers (the Mamdani model). We will use this as our primary method.\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer\n\n**Step 4: Perform the Calculation using the Minimum T-norm**\nWe apply the Minimum t-norm to the given values:\n`A = min(0.7, 0.9)`\n`A = 0.7`\n\n**Step 5: Conclude the Result**\nBased on the standard Mamdani fuzzy implication method which uses the Minimum t-norm, the rule activation level is 0.7.\n\n(For completeness, using the Product t-norm would give `0.7 * 0.9 = 0.63`). Since the Minimum t-norm is the most common default, 0.7 is the most likely expected answer.\n\n<<<0.7>>>"
