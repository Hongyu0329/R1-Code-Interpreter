The appropriate management begins with an immediate medical consultation to control her diabetes (HbA1c 7.5%), followed by local wound care including irrigation of the sockets, prescription of systemic antibiotics, and analgesics. The definitive treatment plan, initiated only after achieving good glycemic control, would be a **Cast Metal Framework Removable Partial Denture (RPD)** made of a Cobalt-Chromium alloy with acrylic teeth. This is the safest and most practical option given her systemic condition, the long span of missing teeth, and her Class III skeletal pattern (SNB 88‚Å∞).

The **cells of interest** are those critical for healing, which are impaired by hyperglycemia: **neutrophils and macrophages** (impaired immune defense), **fibroblasts** (delayed soft tissue healing), and **osteoblasts** (impaired bone formation).

For the RPD, the **abutment teeth** would include the **left central incisor and left second premolar** (adjacent to the space) as well as the **right canine and right first molar**. Using teeth on the opposite side is crucial for **cross-arch stabilization**, preventing the denture from rocking and ensuring stability and function.
