    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   We are given a graph $G$.\n    *   The number of vertices is $n = 12345$.\n    *   The graph is not a complete graph ($G \\neq K_{12345}$).\n    *   The question asks for the *maximum* number of colors needed for a proper vertex coloring of such a graph $G$. This is equivalent to finding the maximum possible value of the chromatic number, $\\chi(G)$, for any graph $G$ that satisfies the given conditions.\n\n2.  **Recall Fundamental Concepts of Graph Coloring:**\n    *   A **proper vertex coloring** assigns a color to each vertex such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color.\n    *   The **chromatic number**, $\\chi(G)$, is the minimum number of colors required for a proper coloring of $G$.\n    *   A **complete graph**, $K_n$, is a graph on $n$ vertices where every vertex is connected to every other vertex. To color $K_n$, every vertex must receive a unique color, so $\\chi(K_n) = n$.\n\n3.  **Establish an Upper Bound for the Chromatic Number:**\n    *   For any graph $G$ with $n$ vertices, the chromatic number is at most $n$, i.e., $\\chi(G) \\le n$. This is because, in the worst case, we can assign a unique color to each vertex.\n    *   The equality $\\chi(G) = n$ holds *if and only if* $G$ is the complete graph $K_n$.\n    *   The problem explicitly states that $G$ is **not** a complete graph. Therefore, $G \\neq K_{12345}$.\n    *   This implies that the chromatic number of $G$ must be strictly less than $n$.\n    *   So, we have a firm upper bound: $\\chi(G) \\le n - 1$.\n    *   For $n = 12345$, this means $\\chi(G) \\le 12345 - 1 = 12344$.\n    *   This tells us that no graph under the given conditions can require more than 12344 colors.\n\n4.  **Determine if this Upper Bound is Achievable (Lower Bound):**\n    *   To find the *maximum* number of required colors, we need to check if there actually exists a graph $G$ (satisfying the problem's conditions) that requires 12344 colors. We can prove this by construction.\n    *   Let's construct a graph, call it $G'$, with $n=12345$ vertices. Start with the complete graph $K_{12345}$ and remove a single edge. Let the vertices be $\\{v_1, v_2, \\ldots, v_{12345}\\}$, and let the removed edge be $(v_1, v_2)$.\n    *   This graph $G'$ satisfies the conditions:\n        *   It has 12345 vertices.\n        *   It is not a complete graph because the edge $(v_1, v_2)$ is missing.\n    *   Now, we must find the chromatic number of this graph, $\\chi(G')$.\n    *   A key property is that the chromatic number of a graph must be at least the size of its largest clique (a subset of vertices where every two distinct vertices are adjacent). This is the clique number, $\\omega(G)$. So, $\\chi(G') \\ge \\omega(G')$.\n    *   Consider the subgraph of $G'$ induced by the vertices $\\{v_1, v_3, v_4, \\ldots, v_{12345}\\}$. This set has $12344$ vertices. In the original $K_{12345}$, all these vertices were connected to each other. Since the removed edge $(v_1, v_2)$ does not involve any pair from $\\{v_3, \\ldots, v_{12345}\\}$, this subgraph remains a complete graph on 12344 vertices, i.e., a $K_{12344}$.\n    *   Since $G'$ contains a $K_{12344}$ as a subgraph, its clique number is at least 12344. So, $\\omega(G') \\ge 12344$.\n    *   This means that we need at least 12344 colors to properly color $G'$. So, $\\chi(G') \\ge 12344$.\n\n5.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    *   From Step 3, we concluded that for any graph $G$ meeting the criteria, $\\chi(G) \\le 12344$.\n    *   From Step 4, we constructed a specific graph $G'$ meeting the criteria for which $\\chi(G') \\ge 12344$.\n    *   Combining these two results, the chromatic number of our constructed graph $G'$ must be exactly 12344.\n    *   Since we have found a graph that requires 12344 colors, and we know that no such graph can require more than 12344 colors, the maximum number of colors needed is 12344.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   The phrase \"maximum degree $\\Delta(G)$\" is descriptive terminology for graphs in general and does not impose a specific value for the maximum degree in this problem. The critical constraints are the number of vertices and the fact that the graph is not complete.\n*   This problem is an application of a classic result in graph theory: the maximum chromatic number for a non-complete graph on $n$ vertices is $n-1$.\n*   The argument relies on finding both an upper bound (what is the most colors we could possibly need?) and a lower bound (can we find a graph that actually needs that many colors?). When the upper and lower bounds meet, we have found our maximum.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe maximum number of colours needed is $n-1$, where $n=12345$.\nSo the answer is $12345 - 1 = 12344$.\n\n<<<12344>>>"
