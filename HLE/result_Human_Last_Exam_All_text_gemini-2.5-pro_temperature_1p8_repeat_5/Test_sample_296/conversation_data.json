    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of subgroups of index 4 in the Grigorchuk group (Γ).\n\n**1. Categorization of Subgroups**\nA subgroup `H` of a group `G` is either normal or not normal. We can count the subgroups of index 4 by counting the number of normal subgroups and the number of non-normal subgroups separately.\nThe index `[G:H]` is the number of left (or right) cosets of H in G. For a finite index subgroup, we can associate a group action.\n\n**2. Counting Normal Subgroups of Index 4**\n\n*   If `H` is a normal subgroup of `Γ` with index 4, then the quotient group `Γ/H` is a group of order 4.\n*   The possible groups of order 4 are the cyclic group `C_4` and the Klein four-group `V_4 \\cong Z_2 \\times Z_2`.\n*   Any homomorphism from a group `G` to an abelian group `A` must factor through the abelianization of `G`, denoted `G^{ab} = G/[G, G]`. That is, `Hom(G, A) \\cong Hom(G^{ab}, A)`.\n*   The abelianization of the Grigorchuk group is well-known: `Γ^{ab} \\cong Z_2 \\times Z_2 \\times Z_2 = Z_2^3`.\n\n*   **Case 1: `Γ/H \\cong C_4`**\n    A surjective homomorphism `φ: Γ \\to C_4` would imply a surjective homomorphism from `Γ^{ab} = Z_2^3` to `C_4`. However, every element in `Z_2^3` has order 1 or 2. The image of any element under a homomorphism must have an order that divides the original element's order. Thus, every element from `Z_2^3` must be mapped to an element of order 1 or 2 in `C_4`. The elements of order 1 or 2 in `C_4` form the subgroup `{0, 2} \\cong Z_2`. Therefore, the image of any homomorphism from `Z_2^3` to `C_4` is contained in this `Z_2` subgroup, and cannot be the whole of `C_4`. So, there are no surjective homomorphisms from `Γ` to `C_4`. This means `Γ` has no normal subgroups with a `C_4` quotient.\n\n*   **Case 2: `Γ/H \\cong V_4`**\n    We need to count the number of normal subgroups `H` such that `Γ/H \\cong V_4`. This is equivalent to counting the number of surjective homomorphisms (epimorphisms) from `Γ` to `V_4`, divided by the size of the automorphism group of `V_4`.\n    The number of epimorphisms `φ: Γ \\to V_4` is equal to the number of epimorphisms from `Γ^{ab} = Z_2^3` to `V_4 = Z_2^2`.\n    - Total homomorphisms `Hom(Z_2^3, Z_2^2)`: `|Z_2^2|^(dim(Z_2^3)) = 4^3 = 64`.\n    - Non-surjective homomorphisms are those whose image is a proper subgroup of `V_4`. The proper subgroups are the trivial group `{e}` and three subgroups of order 2.\n    - Image is `{e}`: There is 1 such homomorphism (the zero map).\n    - Image is `Z_2`: There are 3 subgroups isomorphic to `Z_2` in `V_4`. For each, the number of surjective maps from `Z_2^3 \\to Z_2` is `|Hom(Z_2^3, Z_2)| - 1 = (2^3) - 1 = 7`. So there are `3 \\times 7 = 21` such maps.\n    - Total epimorphisms `|Epi(Γ, V_4)| = 64 - (1 + 21) = 42`.\n    - The number of distinct kernels (which are the normal subgroups we seek) is `|Epi(Γ, V_4)| / |Aut(V_4)|`. The automorphism group `Aut(V_4)` is `GL(2, Z_2)`, which has order `(2^2-1)(2^2-2) = 6`.\n    - Number of normal subgroups of index 4 = `42 / 6 = 7`.\n\n**3. Counting Non-Normal Subgroups of Index 4**\n\n*   Let `H` be a non-normal subgroup of index 4 in `Γ`. The action of `Γ` on the set of four left cosets `Γ/H` induces a transitive permutation representation, which is a homomorphism `φ: Γ \\to S_4`.\n*   The kernel of this homomorphism is `Core(H) = \\cap_{g \\in Γ} gHg^{-1}`, which is the largest normal subgroup of `Γ` contained in `H`. Since `H` is not normal, `Core(H)` is strictly smaller than `H`.\n*   The image `Im(φ) \\cong Γ/Core(H)` must be a transitive subgroup of `S_4`. Since `Γ` is a 2-group (all its finite quotients are 2-groups), `Im(φ)` must be a transitive 2-subgroup of `S_4`.\n*   The transitive subgroups of `S_4` are `C_4`, `V_4`, `D_8`, `A_4`, `S_4`. The 2-groups among these are `C_4`, `V_4`, `D_8`.\n    - We already ruled out `C_4` as a possible quotient of `Γ`.\n    - If `Im(φ) \\cong V_4`, then `Γ/Core(H) \\cong V_4`. The subgroup `H` corresponds to the stabilizer of a point. Since `V_4` is abelian, its action on itself by translation is regular, meaning the stabilizer of any point is the trivial subgroup. This would imply `H/Core(H)` is trivial, so `H=Core(H)`, meaning `H` is normal. This contradicts our assumption.\n    - Thus, the image must be the dihedral group of order 8, `Im(φ) \\cong D_8`.\n*   This means that any non-normal subgroup `H` of index 4 has a core `K=Core(H)` which is a normal subgroup of index 8, and `Γ/K \\cong D_8`.\n*   The subgroup `H` corresponds via the lattice theorem to a subgroup `H/K` of `Γ/K \\cong D_8`. The index `[Γ/K : H/K] = [Γ:H] = 4`.\n*   So `H/K` must be a subgroup of `D_8` of order `|D_8|/4 = 8/4 = 2`.\n*   For `H` to be non-normal in `Γ`, `H/K` must be non-normal in `Γ/K \\cong D_8`.\n*   `D_8` has 5 subgroups of order 2. One of them (the center) is normal. The other four are non-normal.\n*   For each normal subgroup `K` of `Γ` with `Γ/K \\cong D_8`, there are 4 non-normal subgroups of order 2 in `D_8`, each giving rise to a distinct non-normal subgroup of index 4 in `Γ`.\n\n*   **How many normal subgroups `K` with `Γ/K \\cong D_8` exist?**\n    This requires specific knowledge about the Grigorchuk group's structure. It is a known result that `Γ` has exactly one normal subgroup `K` such that `Γ/K \\cong D_8`. This subgroup is the stabilizer of the second level of the binary tree, denoted `Stab_Γ(2)`.\n\n*   Therefore, there is one such normal subgroup `K`, and for this `K`, we have 4 non-normal subgroups of index 4. The total number of non-normal subgroups of index 4 is `1 \\times 4 = 4`.\n\n**4. Final Count**\n\nTotal number of subgroups of index 4 = (Number of normal subgroups) + (Number of non-normal subgroups)\nTotal = 7 + 4 = 11."
