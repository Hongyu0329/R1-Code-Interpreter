    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the solution.\n\n**Step 1: Find the equilibrium points of the system.**\n\nThe given differential equation is $x'(t) = -x^{3}(t) + 2x^{2}(t) - x(t)$.\nEquilibrium points (also called fixed points or critical points) are the values of $x$ for which the rate of change is zero, i.e., $x'(t) = 0$.\nLet's set the right-hand side of the equation to zero:\n$f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 - x = 0$\n\nTo solve this equation, we can factor out a common term, $-x$:\n$-x(x^2 - 2x + 1) = 0$\n\nThe quadratic term inside the parenthesis is a perfect square: $x^2 - 2x + 1 = (x-1)^2$.\nSo, the equation becomes:\n$-x(x-1)^2 = 0$\n\nThis equation gives us two solutions:\n1.  $-x = 0 \\implies x_1 = 0$\n2.  $(x-1)^2 = 0 \\implies x-1=0 \\implies x_2 = 1$\n\nThus, the equilibrium points are $x=0$ and $x=1$.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the stability of each equilibrium point.**\n\nThe stability of an equilibrium point $x^*$ can be determined by analyzing the sign of the derivative of $f(x)$, which is $f'(x)$, at that point.\n*   If $f'(x^*) < 0$, the equilibrium point is **stable**.\n*   If $f'(x^*) > 0$, the equilibrium point is **unstable**.\n*   If $f'(x^*) = 0$, the test is inconclusive, and we need to use another method, like analyzing the sign of $f(x)$ around the equilibrium point.\n\nLet's find the derivative of $f(x)$:\n$f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 - x$\n$f'(x) = -3x^2 + 4x - 1$\n\nNow, let's test each equilibrium point:\n\n*   **For the equilibrium point $x_1 = 0$:**\n    $f'(0) = -3(0)^2 + 4(0) - 1 = -1$\n    Since $f'(0) = -1 < 0$, the equilibrium point $x=0$ is **stable**.\n\n*   **For the equilibrium point $x_2 = 1$:**\n    $f'(1) = -3(1)^2 + 4(1) - 1 = -3 + 4 - 1 = 0$\n    Since $f'(1) = 0$, the first derivative test is inconclusive. We need to analyze the sign of $f(x) = -x(x-1)^2$ in the neighborhood of $x=1$.\n    *   Consider a value of $x$ slightly greater than 1, say $x = 1 + \\epsilon$ for a small $\\epsilon > 0$.\n        $f(1+\\epsilon) = -(1+\\epsilon)((1+\\epsilon)-1)^2 = -(1+\\epsilon)(\\epsilon)^2$. Since $1+\\epsilon$ is positive and $\\epsilon^2$ is positive, $f(1+\\epsilon)$ is negative. This means that if $x > 1$, $x'(t) < 0$, and the solution $x(t)$ will decrease, moving towards $x=1$.\n    *   Consider a value of $x$ slightly less than 1, say $x = 1 - \\epsilon$ for a small $\\epsilon > 0$. For simplicity, let's pick a value between 0 and 1, e.g., $x=0.5$.\n        $f(0.5) = -0.5(0.5-1)^2 = -0.5(-0.5)^2 = -0.5(0.25) = -0.125$. Since $f(0.5)$ is negative, if $x < 1$ (and $x>0$), $x'(t) < 0$, and the solution $x(t)$ will decrease, moving away from $x=1$.\n\nFor an equilibrium to be stable, solutions from both sides must converge to it. Since solutions starting from the left of $x=1$ move away from it, the equilibrium point $x=1$ is not stable. It is classified as a semi-stable equilibrium.\n\n**Step 3: Count the number of stable equilibrium points (m).**\n\nBased on our analysis:\n*   $x=0$ is a stable equilibrium point.\n*   $x=1$ is not a stable equilibrium point.\n\nTherefore, the total number of stable equilibrium points is $m=1$.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the final value.**\n\nThe question asks for the value of $m - 2^{4048}$.\nSubstituting the value of $m=1$ into the expression:\n$1 - 2^{4048}$\n\nThis is the final answer.\n\n<<<1 - 2^4048>>>"
