    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the minimal number of critical points for a smooth function $f : T^2 \\to \\mathbb{R}$.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Preliminaries**\n\n*   **Torus ($T^2$)**: A compact surface without boundary, like the surface of a donut. It can be represented as the quotient space $\\mathbb{R}^2 / \\mathbb{Z}^2$ or as the product of two circles $S^1 \\times S^1$.\n*   **Smooth Function**: A function $f: T^2 \\to \\mathbb{R}$ that is infinitely differentiable.\n*   **Critical Point**: A point $p \\in T^2$ where the derivative (differential) of $f$ vanishes. In local coordinates $(x,y)$, this means $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}(p) = 0$ and $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}(p) = 0$.\n\n**Step 2: Basic Lower Bound using Compactness**\n\n1.  The 2-torus $T^2$ is a compact manifold.\n2.  By the Extreme Value Theorem, any continuous function on a compact set must attain a global maximum and a global minimum.\n3.  For a smooth function, any local extremum (including global ones) must be a critical point.\n4.  If the function $f$ is not constant, the global maximum and global minimum must occur at different points.\n5.  Therefore, any non-constant smooth function on the torus must have at least **two** critical points.\n\n**Step 3: A better lower bound using Lusternik-Schnirelmann (LS) Theory**\n\nA fundamental result in topology, the Lusternik-Schnirelmann theorem, states that for any smooth function $f$ on a compact manifold $M$, the number of critical points of $f$ is at least the *Lusternik-Schnirelmann category* of $M$, denoted $\\text{cat}(M)$.\n\n1.  The LS category of the n-torus $T^n$ is known to be $n+1$.\n2.  For the 2-torus $T^2$, this means $\\text{cat}(T^2) = 2+1 = 3$.\n3.  Therefore, any smooth function on the 2-torus must have at least **three** critical points.\n\n**Step 4: Using Morse Theory for a bound on Morse functions**\n\nMorse theory provides a powerful connection between the number of critical points of a special type of function (a Morse function) and the topology of the manifold.\n\n1.  A **Morse function** is a smooth function whose critical points are all non-degenerate (meaning the Hessian matrix at each critical point is invertible). Most functions are Morse functions.\n2.  For a Morse function, the number of critical points of index $k$, denoted $c_k$, must satisfy the **Morse inequalities**: $c_k \\ge b_k(M)$, where $b_k(M)$ is the $k$-th Betti number of the manifold $M$.\n3.  The Betti numbers of the 2-torus $T^2$ describe its topology:\n    *   $b_0(T^2) = 1$ (one connected component)\n    *   $b_1(T^2) = 2$ (two independent non-contractible loops, the \"latitude\" and \"longitude\")\n    *   $b_2(T^2) = 1$ (one enclosed \"void\")\n4.  Applying the Morse inequalities for a Morse function on $T^2$:\n    *   $c_0$ (number of local minima) $\\ge b_0 = 1$.\n    *   $c_1$ (number of saddle points) $\\ge b_1 = 2$.\n    *   $c_2$ (number of local maxima) $\\ge b_2 = 1$.\n5.  The total number of critical points $C = c_0 + c_1 + c_2$. Therefore, for any Morse function, $C \\ge b_0 + b_1 + b_2 = 1 + 2 + 1 = 4$.\n6.  This establishes that any *Morse function* on the torus must have at least **four** critical points.\n\n**Step 5: Finding an example function**\n\nWe need to check if the bound of 4 can be achieved. Let's construct a function with exactly 4 critical points. Consider the torus as $T^2 = S^1 \\times S^1$, with coordinates $(\\theta_1, \\theta_2)$ where $\\theta_1, \\theta_2 \\in [0, 2\\pi)$.\n\nDefine the function $f(\\theta_1, \\theta_2) = \\cos(\\theta_1) + \\cos(\\theta_2)$.\nThe critical points are found by setting the gradient to zero:\n*   $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\theta_1} = -\\sin(\\theta_1) = 0 \\implies \\theta_1 = 0$ or $\\pi$.\n*   $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\theta_2} = -\\sin(\\theta_2) = 0 \\implies \\theta_2 = 0$ or $\\pi$.\n\nThis gives four critical points:\n1.  $(\\pi, \\pi)$: $f(\\pi, \\pi) = -1 - 1 = -2$. This is the global minimum (index 0).\n2.  $(\\pi, 0)$: $f(\\pi, 0) = -1 + 1 = 0$. This is a saddle point (index 1).\n3.  $(0, \\pi)$: $f(0, \\pi) = 1 - 1 = 0$. This is also a saddle point (index 1).\n4.  $(0, 0)$: $f(0, 0) = 1 + 1 = 2$. This is the global maximum (index 2).\n\nThis function is a Morse function and has exactly 4 critical points ($c_0=1, c_1=2, c_2=1$). This shows that the minimal number of critical points is at most 4.\n\n**Step 6: Reconciling the bounds and finding the final answer**\n\n*   We know the minimum number is at least 3 (from LS theory).\n*   We know that *if* the function is a Morse function, the minimum is 4.\n*   We have an example of a function with 4 critical points.\n\nThe remaining question is whether a non-Morse function (one with degenerate critical points) could exist with only 3 critical points.\n\nThis is a non-trivial question. While LS theory provides a general lower bound of 3, this bound is not always achievable. A deeper result, established by M. Farber using techniques related to Novikov homology, shows that any smooth function on the n-torus $T^n$ must have at least $2^n$ critical points.\n\nFor the 2-torus ($n=2$), this theorem implies that any smooth function must have at least $2^2=4$ critical points.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n1.  Theory guarantees a minimum of at least 4 critical points for any smooth function on $T^2$.\n2.  We have constructed an explicit function with exactly 4 critical points.\n\nTherefore, the minimal number of critical points is exactly 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
