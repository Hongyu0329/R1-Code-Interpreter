    "### Step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The question asks for a specific philosopher who meets three criteria:\n    *   Belongs to the **Lviv-Warsaw School**.\n    *   Analyzed the concept of a **\"hallmark\"** (or more generally, a \"sign\").\n    *   Decomposed this concept into two distinct categories: **\"symptoms\"** and **\"signals\"**.\n\n2.  **Identify the Lviv-Warsaw School:** This was a highly influential Polish school of logic and analytic philosophy active between the two World Wars and beyond. Its key figures included Kazimierz Twardowski (the founder), Jan Łukasiewicz, Stanisław Leśniewski, Alfred Tarski, Tadeusz Kotarbiński, and Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz, among others. The school was known for its clarity, precision, and focus on semantics, logic, and epistemology.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Core Philosophical Concept:** The question concerns the theory of signs (semiotics). A \"hallmark,\" \"mark,\" or \"sign\" is an object, quality, event, or entity whose presence or occurrence indicates the probable presence or occurrence of something else. The question states that this general notion was broken down into \"symptoms\" and \"signals.\"\n\n4.  **Define \"Symptom\" and \"Signal\" in this Context:**\n    *   A **symptom** (also known as a natural sign) has a natural or causal connection to what it signifies. For example, smoke is a symptom of fire; a fever is a symptom of an illness. The connection exists independently of human convention.\n    *   A **signal** (also known as a conventional sign) has a connection to what it signifies based on human agreement, convention, or rules. The relationship is arbitrary. For example, a red light is a signal to stop; the word \"cat\" is a signal for a feline animal.\n\n5.  **Connect the Concept to the School:** We must search the works of the Lviv-Warsaw School philosophers for this specific semiotic distinction. When we examine the works of the school's major figures, the one who most prominently deals with semantics and the theory of signs in this manner is **Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz**.\n\n6.  **Confirm the Attribution:** Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz, in his works on logic and language (such as *Pragmatic Logic*), explicitly analyzes the concept of a sign (*znak* in Polish). He makes a fundamental distinction between:\n    *   **Symptoms** (*oznaki*), which are natural signs.\n    *   **Signals** (*sygnały*), which are conventional signs.\n    This analysis is a key part of his contribution to semiotics and the philosophy of language, fitting the question's description perfectly.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nBased on the analysis, the philosopher from the Lviv-Warsaw School who decomposed the notion of a sign or hallmark into the sub-categories of symptoms and signals is Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz.\n\n<<<Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz>>>"
