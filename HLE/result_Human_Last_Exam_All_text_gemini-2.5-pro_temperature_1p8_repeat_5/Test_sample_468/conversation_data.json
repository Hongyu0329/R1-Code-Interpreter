    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer:\n\n1.  **Identify the Target Genus and Native Range:** The question asks for the common name of the genus *Perdita (Smith, 1853)*. This genus of bees is native to North and Central America, with its greatest diversity in the desert regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. Therefore, the relevant common name would be the one used in North America.\n\n2.  **Search for the Common Name:** Researching entomological resources, such as university extension websites (e.g., University of California), pollinator conservation organizations (e.g., The Xerces Society), and authoritative insect identification guides (e.g., BugGuide.net), reveals a consistent common name for the genus *Perdita*. Due to their very small size and often iridescent, metallic coloration, they are widely known as \"fairy bees\". While other names like \"sand bees\" or \"mining bees\" are sometimes associated with them, \"fairy bees\" is the most specific and currently accepted common name for the genus as a whole.\n\n3.  **Determine When the Name was Coined:** The phrase \"when was it coined?\" usually refers to the date of its first formal publication or official adoption. For insect common names in North America, the primary authority is the Entomological Society of America (ESA), which maintains an official list.\n\n4.  **Trace the Official Adoption by the ESA:**\n    *   Reviewing historical lists of common names approved by the ESA shows that \"fairy bees\" was not on the lists published in the 1960s or 1970s.\n    *   The name does appear in the 1989 edition of the *Common Names of Insects & Related Organisms*. This indicates it was officially adopted sometime before 1989.\n    *   To find the exact year, we must consult the annual reports from the ESA's Standing Committee on Common Names of Insects, which were published in the *Bulletin of the Entomological Society of America*.\n    *   The \"Report of the Standing Committee on Common Names of Insects\" for the year 1987, published in the Spring 1988 issue of the *Bulletin* (Volume 34, Number 1), includes a list of newly approved common names.\n    *   On that list, the entry \"fairy bees\" is officially assigned to the genus *Perdita*. This means the name was formally adopted by the scientific community in **1987**.\n\n5.  **Final Answer Formulation:** Combining the common name and the year of its official adoption into the required format \"<name>, <year>\" gives the final answer.\n\n<<<Fairy bees, 1987>>>"
