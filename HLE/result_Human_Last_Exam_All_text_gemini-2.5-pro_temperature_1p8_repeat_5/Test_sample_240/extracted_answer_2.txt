The primary reason a functional MRI coil may not show resonance is that its built-in safety detuning circuit is active by default when the coil is unpowered, intentionally making it non-resonant. This is a fail-safe design feature. Additionally, an unpowered preamplifier can load the coil or improper probe placement can lead to zero magnetic coupling, also preventing the observation of resonance.
