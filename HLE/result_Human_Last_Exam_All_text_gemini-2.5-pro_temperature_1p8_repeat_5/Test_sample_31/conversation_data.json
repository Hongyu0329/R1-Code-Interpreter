    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the minimum number of non-top-facing stickers needed to identify a PLL case.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem Context\n\n*   **PLL (Permutation of the Last Layer):** This is the final step in the CFOP method of solving a Rubik's Cube.\n*   **State of the Cube:** At the beginning of the PLL stage, the last layer (top face, usually yellow) has all its pieces oriented correctly (e.g., all yellow stickers face up). However, the pieces themselves (4 corners and 4 edges) are not in their correct positions.\n*   **The Goal:** To identify which of the 21 possible PLL cases you have, so you can apply the correct algorithm.\n*   **Source of Information:** Since the top face is a solid color for all 21 PLL cases, it provides no information for distinguishing them. All information must come from the side stickers of the last layer pieces. There are 4 corner pieces (each with 2 side stickers) and 4 edge pieces (each with 1 side sticker), making a total of 4*2 + 4*1 = 12 non-top-facing stickers.\n*   **The Question:** What is the minimum number of these 12 stickers you must see to be able to distinguish any given PLL case from the other 20?\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing Information Requirements\n\nWe need to find the smallest number `N` such that looking at `N` stickers is always sufficient to uniquely identify the PLL case. Let's analyze this by considering how solvers recognize cases, focusing on the most difficult ones.\n\n*   **Recognition by Patterns:** Solvers don't look at random stickers; they look for patterns on the cube's faces, such as:\n    *   **Bar:** Three stickers of the same color on one face (e.g., Red-Red-Red).\n    *   **Headlights:** Two corner stickers of the same color on one face (e.g., Red-Green-Red).\n    *   **Block:** A 2x1 group of matching stickers formed by a corner and an adjacent edge.\n\n### Step 3: Eliminating Smaller Numbers (N < 5)\n\n*   **Is N=3 enough?** No. Looking at the three stickers on a single face is insufficient. For example, the T-Perm, F-Perm, V-Perm, and Jb-Perm can all appear as \"headlights\" from the front. If you see a `Red-Green-Red` pattern on the front face, you don't know which of these four cases you have. You must look at other stickers.\n*   **Is N=4 enough?** No. This is the crucial point. We must find a \"worst-case scenario\" where seeing 4 stickers still leaves ambiguity. The G-permutations provide this scenario.\n    *   Consider the **Ga-Perm** and **Gc-Perm**.\n    *   Both of these permutations can be oriented on the cube to show the exact same pattern on two adjacent faces: \"headlights\" on the front face and a \"block\" on the left face.\n    *   To see the \"headlights\" on the front, you must observe the two front corner stickers. (2 stickers observed).\n    *   To see the \"block\" on the left, you must observe the left corner's side-sticker and the left edge's sticker. (2 more stickers observed).\n    *   At this point, you have observed **4 stickers** and have determined the pattern is \"(Headlights on Front) + (Block on Left)\". However, this pattern is common to both the `Ga` and `Gc` perms. You cannot distinguish between them yet.\n    *   Therefore, 4 stickers are not enough.\n\n### Step 4: Proving N=5 is the Minimum Required Number\n\n*   Continuing from the worst-case scenario above, after observing 4 stickers and knowing the case is either `Ga` or `Gc`, the standard way to distinguish them is to look at the edge piece on the *right* face.\n    *   In a `Ga-Perm`, the right edge is in its correct, solved position.\n    *   In a `Gc-Perm`, the right edge is swapped with another edge, so it is in an incorrect position.\n*   Observing the sticker on this right edge piece gives you the final piece of information needed. This is the **5th sticker**.\n*   Since there is a valid scenario where you must observe 5 stickers to resolve ambiguity, the minimum number required is at least 5.\n\n### Step 5: Confirming N=5 is Sufficient\n\nIs looking at 5 stickers always enough? Yes. A common recognition method involves looking at the pattern on two adjacent faces.\n\n*   Let's analyze the stickers visible on the Front and Right faces:\n    1.  Front-Left Corner (Front sticker)\n    2.  Front Edge (Front sticker)\n    3.  Front-Right Corner (Front sticker)\n    4.  Front-Right Corner (Right sticker)\n    5.  Right Edge (Right sticker)\n    6.  Back-Right Corner (Right sticker)\n*   This constitutes a view of **6 stickers** and is known to be sufficient to identify any PLL.\n*   A more minimal set that is also sufficient is checking for headlights on the Front face (2 stickers: front-left corner's front sticker, front-right corner's front sticker) and combining that with a full view of the Right face (3 stickers: front-right corner's right sticker, right edge's right sticker, back-right corner's right sticker). This makes a total of **5 stickers**, and this set of information is sufficient to distinguish all 21 cases.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nYou need a minimum of 4 stickers just to identify the pattern that characterizes the most ambiguous cases (like Ga/Gc). You then need to observe at least one more sticker to resolve that ambiguity. Therefore, the minimum number of stickers that must be seen is 5."
