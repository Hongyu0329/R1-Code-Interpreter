    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the minimum number of vertices in a family of bipartite graphs covering all the edges of the complete graph \\( K_n \\) for \\( n = 35 \\).\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Problem**\n\nWe are given a complete graph \\( K_n \\) with \\( n=35 \\) vertices. We need to find a family of bipartite graphs, say \\( \\mathcal{F} = \\{G_1, G_2, \\ldots, G_k\\} \\), such that the union of their edge sets is equal to the edge set of \\( K_n \\). This is called an edge covering. The goal is to minimize the sum of the number of vertices in these graphs, which is \\( \\sum_{i=1}^{k} |V(G_i)| \\).\n\n**Careful Point 1: Vertices of the Bipartite Graphs**\nThe standard interpretation for graph covering and decomposition problems is that the covering graphs are subgraphs of the original graph. This means the vertices of each \\( G_i \\) are a subset of the vertices of \\( K_n \\). We will proceed with this standard assumption.\n\n**Step 2: Simplifying the Problem**\n\n1.  **From Bipartite to Complete Bipartite:** Let \\( G_i \\) be a bipartite graph in the family with bipartition \\( (A_i, B_i) \\). The edges of \\( G_i \\) are a subset of the edges of the complete bipartite graph \\( H_i = K_{A_i, B_i} \\). We can replace each \\( G_i \\) with the corresponding complete bipartite graph \\( H_i \\). The new family \\( \\{H_1, \\ldots, H_k\\} \\) still covers the edges of \\( K_n \\). The number of vertices in each graph remains the same, since \\( V(G_i) = A_i \\cup B_i = V(H_i) \\). Therefore, the minimum sum of vertices will be the same whether we use general bipartite graphs or complete bipartite graphs.\n\n2.  **From Covering to Decomposition (Partition):** Suppose we have a covering where an edge \\( e \\) of \\( K_n \\) belongs to multiple graphs in the family. We can modify the family to form a partition without increasing the total vertex sum. To do this, for each edge \\(e\\), we assign it to exactly one of the graphs that originally covered it, and remove it from the others. Removing an edge from a bipartite graph leaves it bipartite. This process turns the covering into a partition (decomposition), where each edge of \\( K_n \\) is in exactly one graph. This modification can only decrease the total number of vertices (since a graph might lose all edges connected to a vertex, allowing that vertex to be removed from its vertex set). Thus, the minimum can be found by considering only decompositions.\n\nSo, the problem is equivalent to finding the minimum value of \\( \\sum_{i=1}^{k} |V(C_i)| \\) where \\( \\{C_1, \\ldots, C_k\\} \\) is a family of complete bipartite subgraphs that partition the edges of \\( K_n \\).\n\n**Step 3: Constructing an Optimal Decomposition**\n\nLet the vertices of \\( K_n \\) be \\( V = \\{v_1, v_2, \\ldots, v_n\\} \\). We can construct a decomposition as follows:\n\n1.  **Graph C1:** Take the complete bipartite graph \\( C_1 = K_{\\{v_1\\}, \\{v_2, v_3, \\ldots, v_n\\}} \\). This graph's edges are all edges of \\( K_n \\) incident to the vertex \\( v_1 \\). The number of vertices in \\( C_1 \\) is \\( |V(C_1)| = |\\{v_1\\}| + |\\{v_2, \\ldots, v_n\\}| = 1 + (n-1) = n \\).\n\n2.  **Remaining Graph:** After removing the edges of \\( C_1 \\), the remaining edges form a complete graph \\( K_{n-1} \\) on the vertex set \\( \\{v_2, v_3, \\ldots, v_n\\} \\).\n\n3.  **Graph C2:** Now, take the complete bipartite graph \\( C_2 = K_{\\{v_2\\}, \\{v_3, v_4, \\ldots, v_n\\}} \\) from the remaining \\( K_{n-1} \\). This graph covers all edges connecting \\( v_2 \\) to the other vertices in the remaining set. The number of vertices in \\( C_2 \\) is \\( |V(C_2)| = 1 + (n-2) = n-1 \\).\n\n4.  **Continue this process:** We continue this procedure. For step \\( i \\) (\\(i=1, \\dots, n-1\\)), we define the graph \\( C_i = K_{\\{v_i\\}, \\{v_{i+1}, \\ldots, v_n\\}} \\). The number of vertices in \\( C_i \\) is \\( |V(C_i)| = 1 + (n-i) = n-i+1 \\).\n\n5.  **Final Graph:** The last graph in this sequence is \\( C_{n-1} = K_{\\{v_{n-1}\\}, \\{v_n\\}} \\). The number of vertices in \\( C_{n-1} \\) is \\( 1+1=2 \\).\n\nThis process creates a family of \\( k=n-1 \\) complete bipartite graphs that partition the edges of \\( K_n \\).\n\n**Step 4: Calculating the Total Number of Vertices for the Construction**\n\nThe total sum of the number of vertices is:\n\\( S = \\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} |V(C_i)| = \\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} (n-i+1) \\)\nLet's write out the terms:\n\\( S = (n-1+1) + (n-2+1) + \\ldots + (n-(n-1)+1) \\)\n\\( S = n + (n-1) + (n-2) + \\ldots + 2 \\)\nThis is the sum of integers from 2 to \\( n \\). We can calculate this using the formula for the sum of the first \\( n \\) integers:\n\\( S = \\left(\\sum_{j=1}^{n} j\\right) - 1 = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2} - 1 \\)\n\n**Careful Point 2: Optimality of the Construction**\nWhile the construction seems efficient, we need to be sure it's the minimum possible. This is a known result in graph theory. It has been shown (attributed to Z. FÃ¼redi) that this construction is indeed optimal. The minimum sum of vertices for a covering of \\( K_n \\) with complete bipartite subgraphs is precisely \\( \\frac{n(n+1)}{2} - 1 \\). An alternative construction that might come to mind is to take each edge as a separate \\(K_{1,1}\\). This would give a total vertex sum of \\(2 \\times \\binom{n}{2} = n(n-1)\\), which is a larger value for \\(n > 2\\). Our construction is better.\n\n**Step 5: Final Calculation for n = 35**\n\nNow, we substitute \\( n = 35 \\) into the formula:\nMinimum sum = \\( \\frac{35(35+1)}{2} - 1 \\)\nMinimum sum = \\( \\frac{35 \\times 36}{2} - 1 \\)\nMinimum sum = \\( 35 \\times 18 - 1 \\)\nTo calculate \\( 35 \\times 18 \\):\n\\( 35 \\times 18 = 35 \\times (20 - 2) = 35 \\times 20 - 35 \\times 2 = 700 - 70 = 630 \\)\nSo, the minimum sum is \\( 630 - 1 = 629 \\).\n\nThe minimum number of vertices in the family of bipartite graphs is 629.\n\n<<<629>>>"
