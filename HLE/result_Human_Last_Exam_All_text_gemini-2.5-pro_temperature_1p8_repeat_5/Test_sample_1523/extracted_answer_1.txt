The inner product $(\phi, D_\phi)$ for a neutral scalar field in the functional integral representation is given by the expression for twice the quadratic part of the Euclidean action:
$(\phi, D_\phi) = \int_0^\beta d\tau \int d^d x \left[ (\partial_\tau\phi(\tau, \vec{x}))^2 + (\nabla\phi(\tau, \vec{x}))^2 + m^2\phi(\tau, \vec{x})^2 \right]$
where $\beta = 1/T$ is the inverse temperature, $\tau$ is the imaginary time, $\vec{x}$ represents the $d$ spatial coordinates, $m$ is the mass of the scalar field, and the integration is over the Euclidean spacetime volume.
