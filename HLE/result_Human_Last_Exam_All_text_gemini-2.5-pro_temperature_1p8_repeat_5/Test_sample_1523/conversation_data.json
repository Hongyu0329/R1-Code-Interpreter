    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**1. Context: The Partition Function in Finite-Temperature Field Theory**\n\nThe starting point of finite-temperature field theory is the partition function, $Z$, from statistical mechanics. For a quantum system described by a Hamiltonian $H$, it is defined as:\n$Z = \\text{Tr}(e^{-\\beta H})$\nwhere $\\beta = 1/T$ is the inverse temperature (with Boltzmann's constant $k_B=1$).\n\nUsing the functional integral (or path integral) formalism, the partition function for a neutral (real) scalar field $\\phi$ can be written as an integral over all possible field configurations. This requires a Wick rotation to Euclidean spacetime ($t \\to -i\\tau$), where the imaginary time coordinate $\\tau$ is compactified into a circle of circumference $\\beta$.\n\nThe partition function is then:\n$Z = \\int \\mathcal{D}\\phi \\, e^{-S_E[\\phi]}$\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Euclidean Action:** The action in the exponent is the Euclidean action, $S_E$. It's obtained from the Minkowski action by the Wick rotation. For a scalar field with Lagrangian density $\\mathcal{L} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\partial^\\mu\\phi)(\\partial_\\mu\\phi) - \\frac{1}{2}m^2\\phi^2 - V(\\phi)$, the Euclidean Lagrangian density $\\mathcal{L}_E$ becomes $\\mathcal{L}_E = \\frac{1}{2}(\\partial_\\tau\\phi)^2 + \\frac{1}{2}(\\nabla\\phi)^2 + \\frac{1}{2}m^2\\phi^2 + V(\\phi)$.\nThe Euclidean action is the integral of $\\mathcal{L}_E$ over Euclidean spacetime:\n$S_E[\\phi] = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d x \\, \\mathcal{L}_E(\\phi, \\partial_\\mu \\phi)$\nwhere $d$ is the number of spatial dimensions.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Boundary Conditions:** For a bosonic field like a neutral scalar, the trace operation imposes periodic boundary conditions in the imaginary time direction:\n$\\phi(\\tau, \\vec{x}) = \\phi(\\tau+\\beta, \\vec{x})$\n\n**2. Identifying the Inner Product and the Operator $D_\\phi$**\n\nThe notation $(\\phi, D_\\phi)$ suggests that we should express the action in a quadratic form. The operator $D_\\phi$ (usually denoted as just $D$ in this context, as it's independent of $\\phi$ for a free theory) is defined from the part of the action that is quadratic in the field $\\phi$. Let's consider the free theory where the potential $V(\\phi)=0$.\n\nThe quadratic part of the action is:\n$S_E^{(2)}[\\phi] = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d x \\left[ (\\partial_\\tau \\phi)^2 + (\\nabla \\phi)^2 + m^2 \\phi^2 \\right]$\n\nTo find the operator $D$, we write this action in the form $\\frac{1}{2}(\\phi, D\\phi)$. This first requires defining the inner product.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Definition of the Inner Product:** For the space of real-valued functions (fields) $\\phi(\\tau, \\vec{x})$ over Euclidean spacetime, the natural inner product is the standard $L^2$ inner product:\n$(\\psi, \\chi) = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d x \\, \\psi(\\tau, \\vec{x}) \\chi(\\tau, \\vec{x})$\n\nNow, we use integration by parts on $S_E^{(2)}[\\phi]$ to move the derivatives off one $\\phi$ and onto the other.\n*   Term 1: $\\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\, (\\partial_\\tau\\phi)^2 = [\\phi(\\partial_\\tau\\phi)]_0^\\beta - \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\, \\phi(\\partial_\\tau^2\\phi)$. The boundary term vanishes due to the periodic boundary conditions.\n*   Term 2: $\\int d^d x \\, (\\nabla\\phi)^2 = \\oint \\phi(\\nabla\\phi) \\cdot d\\vec{S} - \\int d^d x \\, \\phi(\\nabla^2\\phi)$. The surface integral at spatial infinity vanishes if we assume the fields decay sufficiently fast.\n\nSo, we can rewrite the action as:\n$S_E^{(2)}[\\phi] = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d x \\, \\phi(\\tau, \\vec{x}) \\left[ (-\\partial_\\tau^2 - \\nabla^2 + m^2) \\phi(\\tau, \\vec{x}) \\right]$\nComparing this to the abstract forms $S_E^{(2)} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\phi, D\\phi)$ and the definition of the inner product, we identify the operator $D$ as the Euclidean Klein-Gordon operator:\n$D = -\\partial_\\tau^2 - \\nabla^2 + m^2$\n\n**3. Calculating the Inner Product $(\\phi, D_\\phi)$**\n\nNow we have all the pieces to answer the question. The question asks for the explicit form of the inner product $(\\phi, D_\\phi)$.\nBased on our definition, we have:\n$(\\phi, D_\\phi) = (\\phi, [-\\partial_\\tau^2 - \\nabla^2 + m^2]\\phi) = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d x \\, \\phi(\\tau, \\vec{x}) [-\\partial_\\tau^2 - \\nabla^2 + m^2] \\phi(\\tau, \\vec{x})$\n\nThis expression is precisely twice the quadratic part of the Euclidean action, $2S_E^{(2)}[\\phi]$.\n\n*   **Careful Point 4: Different but Equivalent Forms:** The operator $D = -\\partial_\\tau^2 - \\nabla^2 + m^2$ is self-adjoint (Hermitian) on the space of fields with the specified boundary conditions. This means $(\\phi, D\\psi) = (D\\phi, \\psi)$. Applying this property $(\\phi, D\\phi) = (D\\phi, \\phi)$, and using integration by parts again (in reverse), we can express the inner product in terms of squared derivatives of $\\phi$.\n    $(\\phi, -\\partial_\\tau^2\\phi) = \\int (\\partial_\\tau\\phi)^2 d\\tau d^dx = (\\partial_\\tau\\phi, \\partial_\\tau\\phi)$\n    $(\\phi, -\\nabla^2\\phi) = \\int (\\nabla\\phi)^2 d\\tau d^dx = (\\nabla\\phi, \\nabla\\phi)$\n    $(\\phi, m^2\\phi) = \\int m^2\\phi^2 d\\tau d^dx$\n\nSumming these up gives the final expression for the inner product.\n\n### **Final Answer Derivation**\n\n1.  **Start from the definitions:**\n    *   Inner Product: $(\\psi, \\chi) = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d x \\, \\psi \\chi$\n    *   Operator: $D_\\phi = D = -\\partial_\\tau^2 - \\nabla^2 + m^2$\n\n2.  **Write out the expression for $(\\phi, D_\\phi)$:**\n    $(\\phi, D_\\phi) = (\\phi, [-\\partial_\\tau^2 - \\nabla^2 + m^2]\\phi)$\n    $= (\\phi, -\\partial_\\tau^2\\phi) + (\\phi, -\\nabla^2\\phi) + (\\phi, m^2\\phi)$\n\n3.  **Use integration by parts (or the self-adjointness of the derivative operators) for the first two terms:**\n    *   For the time derivative part, using the periodicity in $\\tau$:\n        $(\\phi, -\\partial_\\tau^2\\phi) = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d x \\, \\phi(-\\partial_\\tau^2\\phi) = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d x \\, (\\partial_\\tau\\phi)^2$\n    *   For the space derivative part, assuming fields vanish at spatial infinity:\n        $(\\phi, -\\nabla^2\\phi) = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d x \\, \\phi(-\\nabla^2\\phi) = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d x \\, (\\nabla\\phi)^2$\n    *   The mass term is straightforward:\n        $(\\phi, m^2\\phi) = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d x \\, \\phi(m^2\\phi) = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d x \\, m^2\\phi^2$\n\n4.  **Combine the terms to get the final answer:**\n    $(\\phi, D_\\phi) = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d x \\left[ (\\partial_\\tau\\phi)^2 + (\\nabla\\phi)^2 + m^2\\phi^2 \\right]$\nThis is exactly twice the free Euclidean action, $2 S_E^{(2)}[\\phi]$.\n\n**Momentum Space Representation (for completeness):**\nIf we expand the field $\\phi$ in a Fourier basis, $\\phi(\\tau, \\vec{x}) = T\\sum_n \\int \\frac{d^dp}{(2\\pi)^d} e^{i(\\omega_n \\tau + \\vec{p}\\cdot\\vec{x})} \\tilde{\\phi}(\\omega_n, \\vec{p})$, where $\\omega_n = 2\\pi n T$ are the bosonic Matsubara frequencies, the inner product becomes:\n$(\\phi, D_\\phi) = T \\sum_{n} \\int \\frac{d^d p}{(2\\pi)^d} (\\omega_n^2 + |\\vec{p}|^2 + m^2) |\\tilde{\\phi}(\\omega_n, \\vec{p})|^2$\n\nThe coordinate-space representation is the most direct answer to the question as stated.\n\n<<<The inner product $(\\phi, D_\\phi)$ for a neutral scalar field in the functional integral representation is given by the expression for twice the quadratic part of the Euclidean action:\n$(\\phi, D_\\phi) = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d x \\left[ (\\partial_\\tau\\phi(\\tau, \\vec{x}))^2 + (\\nabla\\phi(\\tau, \\vec{x}))^2 + m^2\\phi(\\tau, \\vec{x})^2 \\right]$\nwhere $\\beta = 1/T$ is the inverse temperature, $\\tau$ is the imaginary time, $\\vec{x}$ represents the $d$ spatial coordinates, $m$ is the mass of the scalar field, and the integration is over the Euclidean spacetime volume.>>>"
