    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Initial Function:** The starting point is the \"generalized pair correlation function.\" In the context of nuclear systems, this function, let's denote it as $G(\\mathbf{r}_1, t_1; \\mathbf{r}_2, t_2)$, quantifies the statistical correlation between the presence of a neutron (or a detection event) at position $\\mathbf{r}_1$ and time $t_1$, and another at position $\\mathbf{r}_2$ and time $t_2$.\n\n2.  **Simplify the Function based on System Properties:** For a system in a steady-state (critical or subcritical), the underlying stochastic processes are assumed to be stationary in time. Furthermore, if the medium is large and uniform (or if we are analyzing fluctuations relative to a mean flux shape), it can be considered homogeneous in space.\n    *   **Time Stationarity:** This means the correlation only depends on the time difference, $\\tau = t_2 - t_1$.\n    *   **Spatial Homogeneity:** This means the correlation only depends on the spatial separation vector, $\\mathbf{r} = \\mathbf{r}_2 - \\mathbf{r}_1$.\n    Under these assumptions, the generalized pair correlation function simplifies to a function of the separation variables, $G(\\mathbf{r}, \\tau)$.\n\n3.  **Understand the Mathematical Operation:** The question asks for the \"space-time, double Fourier transform\" of this function. This is a standard mathematical operation:\n    *   **Time Fourier Transform:** We transform the function from the time-lag domain ($\\tau$) to the frequency domain ($\\omega$ or $f$). The transform of a correlation function with respect to time is known as a **Power Spectral Density**.\n    *   **Space Fourier Transform:** We transform the function from the real space domain ($\\mathbf{r}$) to the reciprocal space or wave-vector domain ($\\mathbf{k}$).\n    *   The combined transformation is a double integral over both space and time:\n        $$S(\\mathbf{k}, \\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} d\\tau \\int_{\\text{all space}} d^3r \\, e^{-i(\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{r} - \\omega \\tau)} G(\\mathbf{r}, \\tau)$$\n\n4.  **Identify the Terminology in the Relevant Field:** We need to find the name given to the resulting function, $S(\\mathbf{k}, \\omega)$, within the nuclear criticality community. This requires knowledge of the specific jargon used in reactor physics and neutron noise analysis.\n    *   The quantity $S(\\mathbf{k}, \\omega)$ represents the spectral power of the neutron population fluctuations corresponding to a specific spatial mode (characterized by wave vector $\\mathbf{k}$) and a temporal frequency ($\\omega$).\n    *   This exact mathematical structure (the double Fourier transform of a pair correlation function) is fundamental in condensed matter physics, particularly in the theory of neutron and X-ray scattering. In that field, this function is universally called the **dynamic structure factor**. It describes how a system scatters radiation as a function of momentum transfer ($\\hbar\\mathbf{k}$) and energy transfer ($\\hbar\\omega$).\n    *   Physicists and engineers in the nuclear field, particularly those working on the theoretical underpinnings of reactor noise, have adopted this well-established terminology. Although the physical context is different (measuring inherent correlations within a neutron field rather than scattering external particles off a target), the mathematical object and the physical information it contains (the structure of correlations in space and time) are analogous.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Distinction from CPSD:** The term Cross-Power Spectral Density (CPSD) refers to the Fourier transform with respect to time *only*. It is a function of frequency and the spatial separation of the detectors, e.g., $CPSD(\\mathbf{r}_1, \\mathbf{r}_2, \\omega)$. The question specifically asks for the *double* (space and time) transform.\n*   **Physical Meaning:** The wave vector $\\mathbf{k}$ relates to the spatial shape of the fluctuation (e.g., related to the geometric buckling, $B^2 \\approx |\\mathbf{k}|^2$, for a fundamental mode), while the frequency $\\omega$ relates to its time evolution (e.g., related to the prompt neutron decay constant, $\\alpha$).\n*   **Analogy:** The key to finding the correct term is recognizing the direct analogy with the dynamic structure factor, $S(\\mathbf{k}, \\omega)$, from scattering theory.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\n\nBy performing a space-time double Fourier transform on the generalized pair correlation function, one obtains a function that describes the structure of neutron density fluctuations in momentum-frequency space. Following the established nomenclature borrowed from condensed matter physics and used in the theoretical reactor noise analysis community, this quantity is called the dynamic structure factor.\n\n<<<Dynamic structure factor>>>"
