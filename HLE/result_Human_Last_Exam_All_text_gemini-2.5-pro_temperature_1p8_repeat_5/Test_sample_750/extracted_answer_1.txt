The solutions are:
1.  The real numbers $z=1$ and $z=-1$.
2.  An infinite sequence of distinct purely imaginary numbers $z_n=iy_n$ for each integer $n \le -1$, where $y_n$ is the unique negative real solution to the equation $-y=e^{-y(\frac{\pi}{2}+2n\pi)}$.
3.  A doubly infinite set of other complex solutions $z_{n,k} = \frac{i}{\frac{\pi}{2}+2n\pi}W_k(-(\frac{\pi}{2}+2n\pi))$, where $W_k$ is the $k$-th branch of the Lambert W function, for integers $n$ and $k$ not corresponding to the solutions above.
