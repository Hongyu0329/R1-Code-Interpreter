    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the complex equation $z \\cdot i = i^z$.\n\n**Step 1: Set up the equation using the definition of complex exponentiation.**\n\nThe equation is $z \\cdot i = i^z$.\nThe term $i^z$ is defined using the complex logarithm as $i^z = e^{z \\ln i}$.\nThe complex logarithm $\\ln i$ is a multi-valued function. We can express $i$ in polar form as $i = e^{i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2n\\pi)}$ for any integer $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\nTherefore, $\\ln i = \\ln(e^{i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2n\\pi)}) = i\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2n\\pi\\right)$.\n\nA complex number $z$ is a solution if there exists at least one integer $n$ for which the equation holds.\nLet's define $C_n = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2n\\pi$. Then $\\ln i = iC_n$.\nThe equation becomes:\n$z \\cdot i = e^{z(iC_n)}$\n$z \\cdot i = e^{zi C_n}$\n\n**Step 2: Use substitution to simplify the equation.**\n\nLet $w = z \\cdot i$. Then $z = \\frac{w}{i} = -wi$. Substituting $w$ into the equation gives:\n$w = e^{w C_n}$\n\nWe need to find all possible values of $w$ that solve this equation for any integer $n$, and then find the corresponding $z = -iw$.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the equation $w = e^{w C_n}$ for different types of solutions for $w$.**\n\nLet $w = u+vi$ where $u,v \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\n**Case 1: Real solutions for $z$ ($z=x \\in \\mathbb{R}, x\\neq 0$).**\nIf $z=x$ is a real number, then $w = xi$ is purely imaginary. So, $u=0$ and $v=x$.\nThe equation $w = e^{w C_n}$ becomes $iv = e^{iv C_n}$.\nIn polar form, this is $iv = \\cos(vC_n) + i\\sin(vC_n)$.\nEquating the real and imaginary parts:\n1.  $\\cos(vC_n) = 0$\n2.  $v = \\sin(vC_n)$\n\nFrom (1), $vC_n = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + m\\pi$ for some integer $m$.\nThis implies that $\\sin(vC_n) = \\sin(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + m\\pi) = (-1)^m$.\nFrom (2), we must have $v = (-1)^m$.\nThis means $v$ can only be $1$ or $-1$.\nIf $v=1$: We need $1 = (-1)^m$, so $m$ must be an even integer, say $m=2k$.\nThe condition $vC_n = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + m\\pi$ becomes $1 \\cdot C_n = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi$.\nSubstituting $C_n = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2n\\pi$, we get $\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2n\\pi = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi$, which means $n=k$. This is always possible for any integer $n$.\nSo, $v=1$ is a valid solution for $w$ (giving $w=i$). This corresponds to $z=x=v=1$.\nIf $v=-1$: We need $-1 = (-1)^m$, so $m$ must be an odd integer, say $m=2k-1$.\nThe condition $vC_n = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + m\\pi$ becomes $(-1)C_n = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + (2k-1)\\pi$.\n$-(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2n\\pi) = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi - \\pi = -\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi$.\n$-\\frac{\\pi}{2} - 2n\\pi = -\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi$, which implies $-n=k$. This is also always possible for any integer $n$.\nSo, $v=-1$ is a valid solution for $w$ (giving $w=-i$). This corresponds to $z=x=v=-1$.\nThus, the only real solutions for $z$ are $z=1$ and $z=-1$.\n\n**Case 2: Purely imaginary solutions for $z$ ($z=iy \\in i\\mathbb{R}, y\\neq 0$).**\nIf $z=iy$ is purely imaginary, then $w = (iy)i = -y$ is a real number. So $v=0$ and $u=-y$.\nThe equation $w=e^{wC_n}$ becomes $u = e^{uC_n}$.\nSince $e^{uC_n}$ is always positive, any solution $u$ must be positive. This means $u=-y > 0$, so $y<0$.\nWe need to solve the real-valued equation $u = e^{uC_n}$ for $u>0$.\nLet's analyze the function $f(u) = e^{uC_n} - u$. We are looking for its roots.\nThe derivative is $f'(u) = C_n e^{uC_n} - 1$.\n- If $C_n>0$ (i.e., $n \\ge 0$), $f'(u)=0$ at $u_0 = \\frac{\\ln(1/C_n)}{C_n}$. The minimum value of $f(u)$ is $f(u_0) = \\frac{1}{C_n} - \\frac{\\ln(1/C_n)}{C_n} = \\frac{1+\\ln(C_n)}{C_n}$. Since $C_n = \\frac{\\pi}{2}+2n\\pi \\ge \\frac{\\pi}{2} > 1$, $\\ln(C_n)>0$, so the minimum value is positive. Thus, no real solutions for $u$ exist when $n \\ge 0$.\n- If $C_n<0$ (i.e., $n \\le -1$), let $D_n = -C_n > 0$. The equation becomes $u = e^{-uD_n}$. Let $g(u)=u$ and $h(u)=e^{-uD_n}$. At $u=0$, $g(0)=0$ and $h(0)=1$. As $u$ increases, $g(u)$ increases linearly while $h(u)$ decreases from 1 towards 0. By the Intermediate Value Theorem, there must be exactly one intersection point for $u>0$.\nLet's call this unique positive solution $u_n$.\nSo for each integer $n \\le -1$, there is a unique solution $w=u_n>0$.\nThis corresponds to a solution $z = -iw = -iu_n$. Since $u_n>0$, this is a purely imaginary number on the negative imaginary axis ($z=iy$ with $y<0$).\nThese solutions are $z_n = -i u_n$, where $u_n$ is the unique positive solution to $u = \\exp(u(\\frac{\\pi}{2}+2n\\pi))$ for $n = -1, -2, -3, \\dots$.\n\n**Case 3: All other complex solutions.**\nFor other values of $n$ and other solutions to $w = e^{w C_n}$, $w$ will be a complex number $u+vi$ with $u \\ne 0$ and $v \\ne 0$. These correspond to solutions $z = -iw = v-iu$ which are neither real nor purely imaginary. These solutions are generally expressed using the Lambert W function, which gives solutions to $X=Ye^Y$.\nThe set of all solutions to $w=e^{wC_n}$ is given by $w_{n,k} = -\\frac{1}{C_n} W_k(-C_n)$ for all integers $k$, where $W_k$ is the $k$-th branch of the Lambert W function.\nThe solutions for $z$ are then $z_{n,k} = -i w_{n,k} = \\frac{i}{C_n} W_k(-C_n)$.\nThe specific cases we found correspond to certain integer pairs $(n,k)$:\n- $z=1$ corresponds to $(n, k=-n)$ for all $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n- $z=-1$ corresponds to $(n, k=n)$ for all $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n- The purely imaginary solutions correspond to $(n, k=0)$ for all $n \\le -1$.\nAll other pairs $(n,k)$ give rise to complex solutions that are not real or purely imaginary.\n\n**Summary of Solutions**\n\nThe set of all solutions for $z \\in \\mathbb{C}$ in the equation $z\\cdot i=i^z$ can be categorized as follows:\n\n1.  **Two real solutions:** $z=1$ and $z=-1$.\n\n2.  **An infinite set of purely imaginary solutions:** For each integer $n \\leq -1$, there is a unique purely imaginary solution $z_n=iy_n$ where $y_n < 0$. This $y_n$ is the unique real solution to the transcendental equation $-y = \\exp\\left(-y\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}+2n\\pi\\right)\\right)$.\n\n3.  **An infinite set of other complex solutions:** These are solutions $z \\in \\mathbb{C} \\setminus (\\mathbb{R} \\cup i\\mathbb{R})$. They are given by $z_{n,k} = \\frac{i}{\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2n\\pi} W_k\\left(-\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2n\\pi\\right)\\right)$ for all pairs of integers $(n,k)$ that do not produce the solutions mentioned in points 1 and 2.\n\n<<<The solutions are:\n1.  The real numbers $z=1$ and $z=-1$.\n2.  An infinite sequence of distinct purely imaginary numbers $z_n=iy_n$ for each integer $n \\le -1$, where $y_n$ is the unique negative real solution to the equation $-y=e^{-y(\\frac{\\pi}{2}+2n\\pi)}$.\n3.  A doubly infinite set of other complex solutions $z_{n,k} = \\frac{i}{\\frac{\\pi}{2}+2n\\pi}W_k(-(\\frac{\\pi}{2}+2n\\pi))$, where $W_k$ is the $k$-th branch of the Lambert W function, for integers $n$ and $k$ not corresponding to the solutions above."
