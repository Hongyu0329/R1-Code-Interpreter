The edges of the image become smoother. This happens because the operator, which is equivalent to a local majority filter for a binary image, erodes convex parts of a shape's boundary and fills in concave parts. This process is a discrete form of motion by mean curvature, which acts to round off sharp corners, eliminate small features, and generally reduce the complexity and total length of the edges over time.
