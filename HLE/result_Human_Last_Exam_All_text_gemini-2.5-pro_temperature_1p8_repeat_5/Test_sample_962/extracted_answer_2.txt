A threshold signature scheme based on the Schnorr signature algorithm, which uses a verifiable secret sharing scheme (like Pedersen VSS) for distributed key generation. The two-round signing protocol proceeds as follows: in Round 1, each of the `t` participating signers generates two secret nonces (`dᵢ`, `eᵢ`) and broadcasts their corresponding public commitments (`Dᵢ=g^{dᵢ}`, `Eᵢ=g^{eᵢ}`). In Round 2, after receiving all commitments, each participant calculates a binding factor `ρⱼ` for every participant `j` by hashing their identity, the message, and the full set of commitments. They then compute the group nonce `R`, the group challenge `c`, and their partial signature `zᵢ = (dᵢ + eᵢρᵢ) + c * λᵢ * xᵢ`, where `xᵢ` is their secret key share and `λᵢ` is their Lagrange coefficient. The final signature is `(R, s)` where `s` is the sum of the partial signatures `zᵢ`. This design is tightly secure because the binding factor mechanism prevents insider attacks on the nonce generation, thus preserving the tight security reduction of the underlying Schnorr signature scheme to the Discrete Logarithm Problem.
