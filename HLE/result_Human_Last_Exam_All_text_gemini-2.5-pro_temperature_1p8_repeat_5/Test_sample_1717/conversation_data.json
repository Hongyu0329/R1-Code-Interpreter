    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode with an infinite number of players, according to Terraria's source code.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Base Health in Expert Mode:**\n    First, we need the base health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode for a single player. In Normal Mode, its health is 2,800. In Expert Mode, this is increased. For a single player in Expert Mode, the Eye of Cthulhu's health is **3,640**.\n\n2.  **Determine the Multiplayer Health Scaling Formula:**\n    In Expert Mode, boss health scales with the number of players present in the world. The source code specifies a formula for this scaling. The total health is multiplied by a factor that increases for each player beyond the first. The formula for this multiplayer health multiplier is:\n    `Multiplier = 1 + 0.35 * (N - 1)`\n    Where `N` is the number of players.\n\n3.  **Construct the Full Health Equation:**\n    By combining the single-player Expert Mode health with the multiplayer scaling formula, we get the equation for the Eye of Cthulhu's total health, `H`, as a function of the number of players, `N`:\n    `H(N) = BaseExpertHealth * (1 + 0.35 * (N - 1))`\n    `H(N) = 3640 * (1 + 0.35N - 0.35)`\n    `H(N) = 3640 * (0.65 + 0.35N)`\n    `H(N) = 2366 + 1274N`\n\n4.  **Analyze the Formula's Behavior with Infinite Players:**\n    The question asks for the theoretical maximum health given an infinite number of players (`N → ∞`). Looking at our linear formula, `H(N) = 2366 + 1274N`, as `N` increases without bound, `H(N)` also increases without bound. Mathematically, the limit is infinity.\n\n5.  **Consider the Constraints of the Source Code:**\n    This is the most critical step. The question specifies that the answer must be \"According to the source code of the video game Terraria\". In the game's code (written in C#), an NPC's health statistics, including its maximum health (`lifeMax`), are stored using a 32-bit signed integer data type (`int`).\n\n6.  **Find the Limit Imposed by the Data Type:**\n    A 32-bit signed integer can only store values within a specific range. The maximum value for an `int` is `2^31 - 1`. Calculating this gives:\n    `int.MaxValue = 2,147,483,647`\n    If the health formula calculates a value greater than this, it cannot be correctly stored in the `lifeMax` variable. The value would overflow (likely wrapping around to a large negative number), which would cause the boss to die instantly or behave incorrectly. Therefore, the highest possible value the `lifeMax` variable can be set to is `2,147,483,647`.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nWhile the mathematical formula for health scales infinitely with the number of players, the game engine's implementation imposes a hard cap due to the data type used for storing the health value. The theoretical maximum health is thus the maximum value of a 32-bit signed integer.\n\n<<<2147483647>>>"
