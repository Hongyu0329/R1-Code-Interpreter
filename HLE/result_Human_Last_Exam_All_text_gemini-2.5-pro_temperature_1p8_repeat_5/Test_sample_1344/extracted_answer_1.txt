The optimal combination is a **Hafnium (Hf)** metal center complexed with a **Constrained-Geometry Catalyst (CGC) ligand** (e.g., a silicon-bridged cyclopentadienyl-amido ligand like [Me₂Si(C₅Me₄)(N-tBu)]²⁻). This active complex should be supported on **Silica (SiO₂) that has been pre-treated with Methylaluminoxane (MAO)**, which acts as both the activator and anchoring agent.
