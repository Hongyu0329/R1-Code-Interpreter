    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the Crawley-Nordström invariant for the given Calabi-Yau Link.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the problem and verify the Calabi-Yau condition.**\n\nThe problem asks for the Crawley-Nordström invariant, denoted $h^{1,1}_{\\text{link}}$, for a Calabi-Yau threefold. This invariant quantifies the contribution to the Hodge number $h^{1,1}$ from the resolution of singularities that the Calabi-Yau hypersurface inherits from the ambient weighted projective space.\n\n*   **Ambient Space:** Weighted projective space $\\mathbb{P}(w_1, w_2, w_3, w_4, w_5) = \\mathbb{P}(22, 29, 49, 50, 75)$.\n*   **Hypersurface Equation:** $F = z_1^8z_3+z_1^4z_2^3z_3+z_1z_2^7+z_1z_2z_3z_4z_5+z_2z_3^4+z_4^3z_5+z_5^3 = 0$.\n*   **Calabi-Yau Condition:** A hypersurface in $\\mathbb{P}(w_1, \\dots, w_5)$ is Calabi-Yau if its weighted degree $d$ equals the sum of the weights $\\sum w_i$.\n\nLet's first calculate the sum of the weights:\n$\\sum w_i = 22 + 29 + 49 + 50 + 75 = 225$.\n\nNow, let's find the weighted degree $d$ of the defining polynomial $F$. The polynomial must be weighted-homogeneous, meaning all its monomials have the same weighted degree.\n*   $\\text{deg}(z_1^8z_3) = 8 \\cdot w_1 + 1 \\cdot w_3 = 8(22) + 49 = 176 + 49 = 225$.\n*   $\\text{deg}(z_1^4z_2^3z_3) = 4 \\cdot w_1 + 3 \\cdot w_2 + 1 \\cdot w_3 = 4(22) + 3(29) + 49 = 88 + 87 + 49 = 224$.\n*   $\\text{deg}(z_1z_2^7) = 1 \\cdot w_1 + 7 \\cdot w_2 = 22 + 7(29) = 22 + 203 = 225$.\n*   $\\text{deg}(z_1z_2z_3z_4z_5) = w_1+w_2+w_3+w_4+w_5 = 225$.\n*   $\\text{deg}(z_2z_3^4) = 1 \\cdot w_2 + 4 \\cdot w_3 = 29 + 4(49) = 29 + 196 = 225$.\n*   $\\text{deg}(z_4^3z_5) = 3 \\cdot w_4 + 1 \\cdot w_5 = 3(50) + 75 = 150 + 75 = 225$.\n*   $\\text{deg}(z_5^3) = 3 \\cdot w_5 = 3(75) = 225$.\n\nThere is a single term with degree 224, while all others have degree 225. This indicates a typo in the provided polynomial equation. However, the Calabi-Yau condition requires $d = \\sum w_i = 225$. We will proceed by assuming $d=225$ and that the provided polynomial is representative of a generic one of this degree, used primarily to determine which singular loci lie on the hypersurface.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the singular loci of the ambient space.**\n\nThe singularities of $\\mathbb{P}(w_1, ..., w_5)$ occur at strata where the weights of the non-zero coordinates share a common divisor greater than 1. We look for singular curves (codimension 3) and singular points (codimension 4).\n\n*   **Singular Curves (Loci of dimension 1):** These correspond to setting three coordinates to zero, say $z_k=z_l=z_m=0$. The locus is $\\mathbb{P}(w_i, w_j)$ and is singular if $\\text{gcd}(w_i, w_j) > 1$.\n    *   $V(z_2, z_3, z_5)$: Corresponds to $\\mathbb{P}(w_1, w_4) = \\mathbb{P}(22, 50)$. We have $\\text{gcd}(22, 50) = 2$. This is a singular curve, let's call it $C_1$.\n    *   $V(z_1, z_2, z_3)$: Corresponds to $\\mathbb{P}(w_4, w_5) = \\mathbb{P}(50, 75)$. We have $\\text{gcd}(50, 75) = 25$. This is a singular curve, let's call it $C_2$.\n    *   Checking other combinations reveals no other singular curves. For instance, $\\text{gcd}(w_1,w_3) = \\text{gcd}(22,49)=1$.\n\n*   **Singular Points (Loci of dimension 0):** These are the vertices of the coordinate simplex. The point $P_i$ (where only $z_i \\neq 0$) is singular because all weights $w_i$ are greater than 1.\n    *   $P_1: [1:0:0:0:0]$\n    *   $P_2: [0:1:0:0:0]$\n    *   $P_3: [0:0:1:0:0]$\n    *   $P_4: [0:0:0:1:0]$\n    *   $P_5: [0:0:0:0:1]$\n\n**Step 3: Determine which singular loci lie on the Calabi-Yau hypersurface $X$.**\n\nA locus lies on the hypersurface $X$ defined by $F=0$ if all monomials in $F$ vanish on that locus.\n\n*   **Curve $C_1 = V(z_2, z_3, z_5)$:** For this locus to be on $X$, every monomial in $F$ must contain at least one of $z_2, z_3, z_5$.\n    *   $z_1^8\\underline{z_3}$, $z_1^4\\underline{z_2^3}\\underline{z_3}$, $z_1\\underline{z_2^7}$, $z_1\\underline{z_2}\\underline{z_3}z_4\\underline{z_5}$, $\\underline{z_2}\\underline{z_3^4}$, $z_4^3\\underline{z_5}$, $\\underline{z_5^3}$.\n    All monomials vanish. So, $C_1 \\subset X$.\n\n*   **Curve $C_2 = V(z_1, z_2, z_3)$:** For this locus to be on $X$, every monomial in $F$ must contain at least one of $z_1, z_2, z_3$.\n    *   The terms $z_4^3z_5$ and $z_5^3$ do not contain any of $z_1, z_2, z_3$. Thus, on this locus, $F$ simplifies to $z_4^3z_5 + z_5^3 = 0$, which is not identically zero. So, $C_2 \\not\\subset X$.\n\n*   **Points $P_i$:** The point $P_i$ lies on $X$ if and only if there is no monomial of the form $c \\cdot z_i^k$ in the polynomial $F$.\n    *   $P_1$: No $z_1^k$ term. $P_1 \\subset X$.\n    *   $P_2$: No $z_2^k$ term. $P_2 \\subset X$.\n    *   $P_3$: No $z_3^k$ term. $P_3 \\subset X$.\n    *   $P_4$: No $z_4^k$ term. $P_4 \\subset X$.\n    *   $P_5$: There is a $z_5^3$ term. $P_5 \\not\\subset X$.\n\nSo, the singular loci of the ambient space that are contained in the hypersurface $X$ are the curve $C_1$ and the points $P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4$.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the contribution of each singular locus to the Crawley-Nordström invariant.**\n\nThe invariant $h^{1,1}_{\\text{link}}$ is the sum of contributions from all singular loci on $X$. The contribution from a locus is the number of exceptional divisors needed to resolve that singularity on the hypersurface. Standard formulas for these contributions are:\n\n*   For a singular curve $C_{ij} = \\mathbb{P}(w_i, w_j)$ on $X$, the contribution is $\\text{gcd}(w_i, w_j) - 1$.\n*   For a singular point $P_k$ on $X$, the contribution is $\\text{gcd}(w_k, d) - 1$.\n\nWe sum these contributions for all the relevant loci identified in Step 3. Note that some points may lie on the curve; under the additive model for contributions that matches known results for these manifolds, we sum all contributions.\n\n*   **Contribution from curve $C_1$**:\n    This is the curve $\\mathbb{P}(22, 50)$. The contribution is $\\text{gcd}(22, 50) - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1$.\n\n*   **Contribution from points $P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4$**:\n    *   $P_1$: Contribution = $\\text{gcd}(w_1, d) - 1 = \\text{gcd}(22, 225) - 1 = 1 - 1 = 0$.\n    *   $P_2$: Contribution = $\\text{gcd}(w_2, d) - 1 = \\text{gcd}(29, 225) - 1 = 1 - 1 = 0$.\n    *   $P_3$: Contribution = $\\text{gcd}(w_3, d) - 1 = \\text{gcd}(49, 225) - 1 = 1 - 1 = 0$.\n    *   $P_4$: Contribution = $\\text{gcd}(w_4, d) - 1 = \\text{gcd}(50, 225) - 1 = 25 - 1 = 24$.\n\n**Step 5: Sum the contributions to find the final answer.**\n\nThe Crawley-Nordström invariant is the sum of all these contributions:\n$h^{1,1}_{\\text{link}} = (\\text{Contr. from } C_1) + (\\text{Contr. from } P_1) + (\\text{Contr. from } P_2) + (\\text{Contr. from } P_3) + (\\text{Contr. from } P_4)$\n$h^{1,1}_{\\text{link}} = 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 24 = 25$.\n\n<<<25>>>"
