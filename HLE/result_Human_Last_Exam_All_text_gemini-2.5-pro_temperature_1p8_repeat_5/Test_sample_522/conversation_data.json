    "This is a puzzle where a '2' moves to an adjacent empty spot ('0') in a grid. The grid is made of '0's (empty space), '1's (walls), and one '2' (the object to move). The core of the puzzle is to determine the rule by which the '2' chooses its new location among the available adjacent '0's.\n\n### Step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Transformation:** In both `Input_A` -> `Output_A` and `Input_B` -> `Output_B`, a '2' changes its position. The original cell of the '2' becomes a '0', and one of the adjacent '0' cells becomes a '2'. All other cells remain unchanged.\n\n2.  **Analyze Example A:**\n    *   **Input:**\n        ```\n        001111\n        121111\n        111111\n        ```\n    *   The '2' is at position (row=1, column=1) (0-indexed).\n    *   **Output:**\n        ```\n        201111\n        101111\n        111111\n        ```\n    *   The '2' moves from (1, 1) to (0, 0). The move vector is (-1, -1), which is \"Up-Left\". The column index of the '2' is 1, which is an odd number.\n\n3.  **Analyze Example B:**\n    *   **Input:**\n        ```\n        0000000000000\n        1100000001000\n        1111000011110\n        1111002111111\n        1111111111111\n        ```\n    *   The '2' is at position (row=3, column=6).\n    *   **Output:**\n        ```\n        0000000000000\n        1100000001000\n        1111000211110\n        1111000111111\n        1111111111111\n        ```\n    *   The '2' moves from (3, 6) to (2, 7). The move vector is (-1, +1), which is \"Up-Right\". The column index of the '2' is 6, which is an even number.\n\n4.  **Deduce the Rule of Movement:**\n    *   From the examples, we observe a pattern. The '2' seems to prioritize moving upwards (to a row with a smaller index).\n    *   The horizontal direction of the move seems to depend on the parity (odd/even) of the starting column of the '2'.\n        *   In Example A, the column is 1 (odd), and the '2' moves left.\n        *   In Example B, the column is 6 (even), and the '2' moves right.\n    *   This leads to a hypothesis for a prioritized search order for an adjacent '0':\n        *   There is a primary vertical preference: Up (row-1) > Sideways (row) > Down (row+1).\n        *   Within each row, there is a horizontal preference based on the starting column `c`:\n            *   If `c` is **odd**, the preference is Left -> Middle -> Right.\n            *   If `c` is **even**, the preference is Right -> Middle -> Left.\n    *   The '2' moves to the first available '0' found using this search order.\n\n5.  **Verify the Rule:**\n    *   **For A (c=1, odd):** Search starts Up-Left `(r-1, c-1)`. Is (0,0) a '0'? Yes. So it moves there. This matches the output.\n    *   **For B (c=6, even):** Search starts Up-Right `(r-1, c+1)`. Is (2,7) a '0'? Yes. So it moves there. This matches the output.\n    *   The rule is consistent and works for both provided examples.\n\n6.  **Apply the Rule to Input_C:**\n    *   **Input:**\n        ```\n        000000\n        011120\n        111111\n        ```\n    *   The '2' is at position (row=1, column=4).\n    *   The starting column index is 4, which is **even**.\n    *   According to our rule, we use the search preference for even columns: vertical preference UP, horizontal preference RIGHT -> MIDDLE -> LEFT.\n    *   The search order begins with the highest priority: Up-Right `(r-1, c+1)`.\n    *   Check the cell at `(1-1, 4+1) = (0, 5)`. The value in `Input_C` at (0, 5) is '0'.\n    *   Since we found an available '0' spot at the first position in our search order, this is the destination. The '2' will move from (1, 4) to (0, 5).\n\n7.  **Construct the Final Answer:**\n    *   Start with the grid for `Input_C`.\n    *   Change the value at the original location of '2', (1, 4), from '2' to '0'.\n    *   Change the value at the destination, (0, 5), from '0' to '2'.\n    *   The resulting grid is:\n        ```\n        000002\n        011100\n        111111\n        ```\n    *   Formatting this as the output string gives: `000002,011100,111111`.\n\n<<<000002,011100,111111>>>"
