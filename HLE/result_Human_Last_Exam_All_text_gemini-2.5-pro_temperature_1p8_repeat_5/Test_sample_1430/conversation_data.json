    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the smallest and largest possible rank of the Néron-Severi group of X.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the objects**\n\n*   **C:** A compact Riemann surface of genus $g=3$.\n*   **X:** The 15th symmetric power of C, denoted $X = C^{(15)}$. This is the space of effective divisors of degree 15 on C. It is a smooth complex projective variety of dimension 15.\n*   **Néron-Severi Group NS(X):** For a smooth projective variety X over $\\mathbb{C}$, the Néron-Severi group $NS(X)$ is the group of line bundles (or divisors) modulo algebraic equivalence. Its rank, denoted $\\rho(X)$, is the Picard number of X.\n*   **The Goal:** We need to find the minimum and maximum possible values of $\\rho(X)$ as C varies over all genus 3 Riemann surfaces.\n\n**2. Relate X to the Jacobian of C**\n\nThe properties of the symmetric power $C^{(d)}$ are closely related to the Jacobian variety $J(C)$ of the curve C. $J(C)$ is a principally polarized abelian variety of dimension $g=3$.\n\nThe Abel-Jacobi map is a morphism $A_d: C^{(d)} \\to J(C)$ defined by sending a divisor $D$ to the line bundle $\\mathcal{O}_C(D - d \\cdot p_0)$, where $p_0$ is a fixed base point on C.\n\nA crucial result states that for $d \\geq 2g-1$, this map is a projective bundle fibration. In our case, $g=3$ and $d=15$. Since $15 \\geq 2(3)-1=5$, the condition holds.\nThe map $A_{15}: X = C^{(15)} \\to J(C)$ is a fibration with fiber isomorphic to the projective space $\\mathbb{P}^{d-g} = \\mathbb{P}^{15-3} = \\mathbb{P}^{12}$.\n\n**3. Analyze the Cohomology and Picard Number**\n\nSince $X$ is a projective bundle over $J(C)$, we can analyze its cohomology using the Leray-Serre spectral sequence. For a fibration $F \\to E \\to B$ where the fundamental group of the base acts trivially on the cohomology of the fiber, the spectral sequence degenerates at the $E_2$ page. This is the case here, as $J(C)$ is a complex torus and the fibration is algebraic.\n\nThis degeneration implies that the cohomology of X decomposes nicely:\n$H^k(X, \\mathbb{Q}) \\cong \\bigoplus_{i=0}^{\\lfloor k/2 \\rfloor} H^{k-2i}(J(C), \\mathbb{Q}) \\otimes H^{2i}(\\mathbb{P}^{12}, \\mathbb{Q})$\n\nFor $k=2$, this gives:\n$H^2(X, \\mathbb{Q}) \\cong H^2(J(C), \\mathbb{Q}) \\oplus H^0(J(C), \\mathbb{Q}) \\otimes H^2(\\mathbb{P}^{12}, \\mathbb{Q})$\n\nLet's look at the ranks (Betti numbers):\n*   $\\text{rank}(H^2(J(C), \\mathbb{Q})) = b_2(J(C)) = \\binom{2g}{2} = \\binom{6}{2} = 15$.\n*   $\\text{rank}(H^0(J(C), \\mathbb{Q})) = b_0(J(C)) = 1$.\n*   $\\text{rank}(H^2(\\mathbb{P}^{12}, \\mathbb{Q})) = b_2(\\mathbb{P}^{12}) = 1$.\n\nSo, $b_2(X) = 15 + 1 \\cdot 1 = 16$.\n\nThe Picard number $\\rho(X)$ is the rank of the subgroup of integral (1,1)-classes in $H^2(X, \\mathbb{Z})$. The decomposition of rational cohomology also respects the Hodge structures:\n$H^{1,1}(X, \\mathbb{C}) \\cong H^{1,1}(J(C), \\mathbb{C}) \\oplus H^{1,1}(\\mathbb{P}^{12}, \\mathbb{C})$\n\nTherefore, the group of algebraic 2-cycles on X (modulo homological equivalence) is the direct sum of those on the base $J(C)$ and those on the fiber $\\mathbb{P}^{12}$. This leads to a simple relation for the Picard numbers:\n$\\rho(X) = \\rho(J(C)) + \\rho(\\mathbb{P}^{12})$\n\nSince $\\rho(\\mathbb{P}^{n}) = 1$ for any $n$, we have:\n$\\rho(X) = \\rho(J(C)) + 1$\n\n**4. Find the Range of $\\rho(J(C))$**\n\nThe problem now reduces to finding the smallest and largest possible Picard numbers for the Jacobian of a genus 3 curve. $J(C)$ is a 3-dimensional principally polarized abelian variety. The rank of its Néron-Severi group, $\\rho(J(C))$, depends on the structure of its endomorphism ring, $\\text{End}(J(C))$.\n\n*   **Smallest Rank:** For a \"very general\" curve C of genus $g=3$, its Jacobian has no extra endomorphisms, meaning its endomorphism ring is just the integers: $\\text{End}(J(C)) = \\mathbb{Z}$. In this case, the Néron-Severi group is generated by the class of the principal polarization (the theta divisor), and its rank is 1. Thus, the minimum possible value is:\n    $\\rho_{min}(J(C)) = 1$.\n\n*   **Largest Rank:** The Picard number $\\rho(A)$ of an abelian variety A of dimension $g$ is bounded by the Hodge number $h^{1,1}(A) = g^2$. For $J(C)$, this means $\\rho(J(C)) \\leq g^2 = 3^2 = 9$.\n    This maximum is achieved if $J(C)$ has sufficiently many complex multiplications (CM). We need to know if there exists a genus 3 curve C whose Jacobian achieves this maximum. The Fermat quartic curve, given by the equation $x^4 + y^4 = z^4$, is a well-known example. It has genus $g=(4-1)(4-2)/2 = 3$. Its Jacobian is of CM type, being isogenous to a product of three copies of an elliptic curve with CM by $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$. For such an abelian variety, the Néron-Severi rank is indeed $g^2=9$. Thus, the maximum possible value is:\n    $\\rho_{max}(J(C)) = 9$.\n\n**5. Calculate the Final Answer**\n\nNow we substitute these values back into our formula for $\\rho(X)$.\n\n*   **Smallest Rank of NS(X):**\n    $\\rho_{min}(X) = \\rho_{min}(J(C)) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2$.\n\n*   **Largest Rank of NS(X):**\n    $\\rho_{max}(X) = \\rho_{max}(J(C)) + 1 = 9 + 1 = 10$.\n\n### List of Careful Points\n\n1.  **Check applicability of the fibration structure:** The formula relating $C^{(d)}$ to $J(C)$ only works for $d \\ge 2g-1$. It was crucial to verify that $15 \\ge 2(3)-1$.\n2.  **Dependence on C:** The rank of NS(X) is not fixed but depends on the choice of the curve C. The question correctly asks for the possible range.\n3.  **Correctly identify the source of variation:** The variation in $\\rho(X)$ comes entirely from the variation in $\\rho(J(C))$. The \"+1\" is constant.\n4.  **Know the range of Picard numbers for Jacobians:** It's a non-trivial fact from the theory of abelian varieties that $\\rho(J(C))$ for a genus g curve can range from 1 (for a generic curve) up to $g^2$ (for a CM curve).\n5.  **Confirm existence of extremal curves:** It's important that genus 3 curves realizing both the minimum $\\rho(J(C))=1$ and maximum $\\rho(J(C))=9$ actually exist. Generic curves provide the minimum, and specific examples like the Fermat quartic provide the maximum.\n\nThe smallest possible rank is 2 and the largest is 10.\n\n<<<The smallest possible rank is 2 and the largest possible rank is 10.>>>"
