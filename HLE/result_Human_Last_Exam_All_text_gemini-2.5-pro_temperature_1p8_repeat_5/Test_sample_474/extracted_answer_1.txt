No, this approach is not valid. The ecological function of a mimicry syndrome is determined by the perception of natural predators (e.g., birds), not humans. The most significant flaw is that human vision is fundamentally different from avian vision; birds can see in the ultraviolet (UV) spectrum, which means two species that look similar to humans might look very different to a bird, and vice versa. Additionally, using static 2D images fails to capture the dynamic, 3D nature of a bee as perceived by a predator in a real encounter. Finally, a cognitive ranking task performed by humans is not a valid proxy for the learned avoidance behavior exhibited by predators. Therefore, the resulting clusters would reflect human visual biases rather than the ecologically functional mimicry rings that exist in nature.
