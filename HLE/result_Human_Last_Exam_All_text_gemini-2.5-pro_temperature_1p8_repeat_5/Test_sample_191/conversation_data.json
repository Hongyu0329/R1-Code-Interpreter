    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Action:** Macrophage engulfment (phagocytosis). Macrophages in the brain are known as microglia.\n    *   **Target:** Amyloid, which are insoluble fibrous protein aggregates, famously associated with Alzheimer's disease (amyloid-beta plaques).\n    *   **Condition:** This engulfment is *allowed* when a specific protein is \"broken down.\"\n    *   **Goal:** Identify this specific protein.\n\n2.  **Identify the Underlying Biological Process:**\n    The question describes an inhibitory process. This means a certain protein is acting as a \"brake\" or a \"stop signal,\" preventing macrophages/microglia from doing their job of clearing amyloid. To make the macrophage work, this brake must be removed or \"broken.\" This is a common mechanism in the immune system, often referred to as an \"immune checkpoint.\"\n\n3.  **Search for the Specific Inhibitory Protein:**\n    Recent research has identified a key receptor on microglia that functions exactly this way in the context of amyloid.\n    *   The protein is an inhibitory receptor present on the surface of microglia.\n    *   The toxic form of amyloid-beta (oligomers) binds directly to this receptor.\n    *   This binding activates the receptor, which sends a \"stop\" signal inside the microglia.\n    *   This signal suppresses the microglia's ability to move towards, engulf, and clear amyloid plaques, essentially making the microglia dysfunctional.\n\n4.  **Name the Protein:**\n    The protein in question is **LILRB2** (Leukocyte Immunoglobulin-like Receptor B2) in humans. The functional equivalent, or ortholog, in mice is known as **PirB** (Paired Immunoglobulin-like Receptor B).\n\n5.  **Explain How \"Breaking It Down\" Works:**\n    The phrase \"broken down\" can be interpreted in several ways, all of which apply here:\n    *   **Genetic Deletion:** In laboratory studies, genetically removing the gene for LILRB2/PirB from mice results in microglia that are no longer inhibited by amyloid and can clear plaques more effectively.\n    *   **Functional Blocking:** Scientists can develop antibodies that bind to the LILRB2 receptor, physically blocking amyloid from binding to it. This also \"breaks\" the inhibitory signal, releasing the brake on the microglia.\n    *   **Degradation:** Natural cellular processes could potentially lead to the breakdown of the protein, though therapeutic strategies focus on blocking or genetic removal.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    The breakdown, removal, or functional blocking of the **LILRB2/PirB** protein releases the inhibition it places on microglia. This restored function allows the microglia to successfully engulf and clear amyloid aggregates.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Human vs. Mouse Protein:** It's important to recognize both names. LILRB2 is the human protein and a direct therapeutic target. PirB is its mouse counterpart, where much of the foundational research has been conducted.\n*   **\"Don't Eat Me\" Signals:** This is distinct from, but related to, the classic CD47 \"don't eat me\" signal. While blocking CD47 can also enhance microglial phagocytosis, LILRB2 is a receptor that is specifically co-opted by the amyloid-beta protein itself to directly suppress microglial function.\n*   **Mechanism of Action:** The key is that this protein is an *inhibitory receptor* on the macrophage/microglia, and its activation by amyloid is what *stops* the engulfment. Breaking the protein or its signaling pathway is what *allows* the engulfment.\n\nWith this analysis, we can confidently identify the protein.\n\n<<<LILRB2 (Leukocyte Immunoglobulin-like Receptor B2) or its mouse ortholog, PirB."
