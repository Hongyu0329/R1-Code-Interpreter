    "An analysis of the symmetries of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations requires finding the Lie group of transformations that leave the equations invariant. The final dimension is the total number of independent parameters in this group.\n\n**1. The Incompressible Navier-Stokes Equations**\n\nIn $\\mathbb{R}^3$, for a fluid with constant density $\\rho$ and kinematic viscosity $\\nu$, the motion is described by the velocity field $\\mathbf{u}(t, \\mathbf{x})$ and the pressure field $p(t, \\mathbf{x})$, where $t$ is time and $\\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$ is position. By setting $\\rho=1$, the equations are:\n\n1.  **Momentum Equation:** $\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}}{\\partial t} + (\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla)\\mathbf{u} = -\\nabla p + \\nu \\Delta \\mathbf{u}$\n2.  **Incompressibility Condition:** $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u} = 0$\n\nA symmetry is a transformation of the independent variables $(t, \\mathbf{x})$ and dependent variables $(\\mathbf{u}, p)$ that maps any solution of this system to another solution.\n\n**2. Step-by-Step Analysis of Symmetries**\n\nWe systematically check for standard physical and mathematical symmetries.\n\n*   **Time Translations (1 parameter):**\n    The equations do not explicitly depend on time $t$. Therefore, a shift in time $t \\to t' = t + s$ for any constant $s$ will leave the equations unchanged.\n    *   Transformation: $(t, \\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{u}, p) \\to (t+s, \\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{u}, p)$.\n    *   **Dimension: 1**\n\n*   **Space Translations (3 parameters):**\n    The equations have constant coefficients and are posed in the whole space $\\mathbb{R}^3$. Thus, they are invariant under spatial shifts $\\mathbf{x} \\to \\mathbf{x}' = \\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{a}$ for any constant vector $\\mathbf{a} \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$.\n    *   Transformation: $(t, \\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{u}, p) \\to (t, \\mathbf{x}+\\mathbf{a}, \\mathbf{u}, p)$.\n    *   **Dimension: 3**\n\n*   **Spatial Rotations (3 parameters):**\n    The equations are isotropic (the same in all directions). A rotation of the coordinate system should lead to a rotated solution. The velocity $\\mathbf{u}$ transforms as a vector, and the pressure $p$ as a scalar. Let $R \\in SO(3)$ be a rotation matrix.\n    *   Transformation: $(t, \\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{u}, p) \\to (t, R\\mathbf{x}, R\\mathbf{u}, p)$.\n    *   **Dimension: 3** (The group of rotations $SO(3)$ is 3-dimensional).\n\n*   **Galilean Boosts (3 parameters):**\n    These transformations correspond to switching to a frame of reference moving with a constant velocity $\\mathbf{v}$.\n    *   Transformation: $t' = t$, $\\mathbf{x}' = \\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{v}t$, $\\mathbf{u}'(\\mathbf{x}', t') = \\mathbf{u}(\\mathbf{x}, t) + \\mathbf{v}$, and the pressure remains invariant, $p'(\\mathbf{x}', t') = p(\\mathbf{x}, t)$. One can verify that these transformations leave both the momentum equation and the incompressibility condition invariant.\n    *   **Dimension: 3** (for the three components of the velocity vector $\\mathbf{v}$).\n\n*   **Scaling Symmetries (1 parameter):**\n    The equations admit a specific scaling transformation. Let's find the scaling exponents for $t' = \\alpha^a t, \\mathbf{x}' = \\alpha^b \\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{u}' = \\alpha^c \\mathbf{u}, p' = \\alpha^d p$. By substituting these into the Navier-Stokes equations and requiring invariance for any $\\alpha$, we find the powers must be related. The relations that satisfy invariance for all terms are: $a=2b, c=-b, d=-2b$. We can choose $b=1$ to define the single parameter group.\n    *   Transformation: $t' = \\alpha^2 t$, $\\mathbf{x}' = \\alpha \\mathbf{x}$, $\\mathbf{u}' = \\alpha^{-1} \\mathbf{u}$, $p' = \\alpha^{-2} p$.\n    *   **Dimension: 1** (for the scaling factor $\\alpha$).\n\n*   **Pressure Shift (1 parameter):**\n    The momentum equation only involves the gradient of the pressure, $\\nabla p$. Therefore, shifting the pressure by a constant $C$ does not change the equation.\n    *   Transformation: $p \\to p' = p + C$.\n    *   This is a valid point symmetry of the system as written.\n    *   **Dimension: 1**\n\n**3. Careful Points and Exclusions**\n\n*   **Gauge Freedom of Pressure:** One might argue that since the pressure $p$ is determined by the velocity $\\mathbf{u}$ via the Poisson equation $\\Delta p = -\\nabla\\cdot((\\mathbf{u}\\cdot\\nabla)\\mathbf{u})$, one could add any harmonic function $h(\\mathbf{x})$ (where $\\Delta h = 0$) to the pressure. However, this transformation ($p \\to p+h(\\mathbf{x})$) is *not* a symmetry of the original momentum equation unless $\\nabla h = 0$, i.e., $h$ is a constant. So, this does not lead to an infinite-dimensional symmetry group for the PDE system itself.\n*   **Case of 2D vs 3D:** It is a well-known result that the Lie group of symmetries for the *2D* incompressible Navier-Stokes equations is infinite-dimensional. This is due to a simplification in the vorticity equation in 2D that does not occur in 3D. The 3D case, which is what the question asks about, has a finite-dimensional symmetry group.\n\n**4. Final Calculation**\n\nSumming the dimensions from each independent family of symmetries:\nTotal Dimension = (Time Translation) + (Space Translations) + (Rotations) + (Galilean Boosts) + (Scaling) + (Pressure Shift)\nTotal Dimension = 1 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 1 + 1 = 12\n\nThe Lie algebra of the symmetry group of the 3D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations is a 12-dimensional algebra.\n\n<<<12>>>"
