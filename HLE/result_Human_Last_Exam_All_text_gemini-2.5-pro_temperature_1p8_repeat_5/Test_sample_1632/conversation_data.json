    "This problem asks for the number of 10-step self-avoiding walks on a Manhattan lattice. Let's analyze this problem step-by-step.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Definitions\n\n*   **Manhattan Lattice:** This is a 2D square grid where points are represented by integer coordinates (x, y). A \"step\" is a move from a point (x, y) to one of its four adjacent neighbors: (x+1, y), (x-1, y), (x, y+1), or (x, y-1).\n*   **n-step Walk:** A sequence of `n+1` points on the lattice, starting from an origin (which we can set as (0,0)), where each point is reached from the previous one by a single step. The walk has a total length of `n` edges.\n*   **Self-Avoiding Walk (SAW):** A walk in which no point (vertex) is visited more than once.\n*   **a(n):** This notation represents the total number of distinct n-step self-avoiding walks starting from the origin.\n\n### Step 2: Step-by-Step Analysis for small n\n\nLet's compute the first few values of a(n) to understand the process and its complexity.\n\n*   **a(0):** A 0-step walk consists of only the starting point (0,0). There is only one such walk.\n    *   **a(0) = 1**\n\n*   **a(1):** From the origin (0,0), we can take one step in any of the 4 cardinal directions (right, left, up, down). All these are unique and self-avoiding.\n    *   **a(1) = 4**\n\n*   **a(2):** We extend each of the 4 walks of length 1. From the end of a 1-step walk, there are 4 possible directions. One of these directions leads back to the origin, which is forbidden in a SAW. Thus, there are 3 valid choices for the second step.\n    *   Number of walks = (Walks of length 1) × (Choices for 2nd step) = 4 × 3 = 12.\n    *   **a(2) = 12**\n\n*   **a(3):** We extend the 12 walks of length 2. Now, the number of choices can depend on the path taken. Let's use symmetry.\n    *   Consider any walk starting with the step (0,0) → (1,0). The second step can go to (2,0), (1,1), or (1,-1).\n        *   Path (0,0)→(1,0)→(2,0): From (2,0), the neighbors are (1,0), (3,0), (2,1), (2,-1). The path cannot go back to (1,0). The other 3 points are new. So, 3 choices.\n        *   Path (0,0)→(1,0)→(1,1): From (1,1), the neighbors are (1,0), (2,1), (0,1), (1,2). The path cannot go back to (1,0). The other 3 points are new. So, 3 choices.\n        *   Path (0,0)→(1,0)→(1,-1): By symmetry with the previous case, there are 3 choices.\n    *   The total number of 3-step walks starting with (0,0)→(1,0) is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9.\n    *   Since there are 4 possible starting directions, we multiply by 4: a(3) = 4 × 9 = 36.\n    *   **a(3) = 36**\n\n*   **a(4):** We extend the 36 walks of length 3. This is where it gets more complex, as some paths can \"curl up\" and restrict future moves.\n    *   Let's analyze the 9 paths of length 3 starting with (0,0)→(1,0).\n        *   For the 3 paths ending at (3,0), (2,1), (2,-1) which started \"straight\" ((0,0)→(1,0)→(2,0)), we found each has 3 extensions, summing to 9 new paths of length 4.\n        *   For the 3 paths ending at (2,1), (1,2), (0,1) which started with a \"turn\" ((0,0)→(1,0)→(1,1)), we must check for self-intersections.\n            *   Path ...→(1,1)→(2,1): End is (2,1). Visited: {(0,0),(1,0),(1,1),(2,1)}. Extensions are fine. 3 choices.\n            *   Path ...→(1,1)→(1,2): End is (1,2). Visited: {(0,0),(1,0),(1,1),(1,2)}. Extensions are fine. 3 choices.\n            *   Path ...→(1,1)→(0,1): End is (0,1). Visited: {(0,0),(1,0),(1,1),(0,1)}. Neighbors of (0,1) are (0,0), (1,1), (-1,1), (0,2). But (0,0) and (1,1) have already been visited. So only 2 choices remain.\n        *   Total from (0,0)→(1,0)→(1,1) is 3 + 3 + 2 = 8 paths.\n        *   By symmetry, starting with (0,0)→(1,0)→(1,-1) also gives 8 paths.\n    *   Total number of 4-step walks starting with (0,0)→(1,0) is 9 + 8 + 8 = 25.\n    *   Total a(4) = 4 × 25 = 100.\n    *   **a(4) = 100**\n\n### Step 3: Evaluating the Complexity for n=10\n\nAs seen in the calculation for a(4), the number of choices at each step depends on the entire history of the path. A manual, case-by-case enumeration becomes prohibitively difficult and error-prone as `n` increases. No simple closed-form formula for a(n) is known. The known values for a(n) have been determined through extensive computer searches using algorithms like backtracking.\n\nThe process would be to:\n1.  Define a recursive function `count_walks(current_path, steps_remaining)`.\n2.  If `steps_remaining` is 0, a valid walk has been found; return 1.\n3.  Otherwise, iterate through the 4 neighbors of the current position.\n4.  For each neighbor, if it has not been visited yet, add it to the path and recursively call the function with the new path and decremented steps.\n5.  Sum the results of the recursive calls.\n\nRunning such a program for n=10 is feasible for a modern computer, but completely impractical to perform by hand.\n\n### Step 4: Acquiring the Final Answer\n\nSince a direct calculation is not feasible in this context, the appropriate method is to refer to the known, computationally-derived sequence for this famous combinatorial problem. The sequence for the number of self-avoiding walks on a square lattice is listed in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) as A001411.\n\nThe sequence begins:\n*   a(1) = 4\n*   a(2) = 12\n*   a(3) = 36\n*   a(4) = 100\n*   a(5) = 284\n*   a(6) = 780\n*   a(7) = 2,172\n*   a(8) = 5,916\n*   a(9) = 16,268\n*   **a(10) = 44,100**\n\nThus, the number of 10-step self-avoiding walks on a Manhattan lattice is 44,100.\n\n<<<44100>>>"
