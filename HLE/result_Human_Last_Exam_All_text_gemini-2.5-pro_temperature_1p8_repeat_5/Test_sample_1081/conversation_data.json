    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a reductive group of type $E_8$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the structure of the group $G$\nThe question specifies that $G$ is a reductive group of type $E_8$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$. A reductive group over a non-algebraically closed field like $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is not uniquely determined by its root system type. There can be different \"forms\" of the group, which become isomorphic only over the algebraic closure $\\bar{\\mathbb{F}}_q$. These forms are classified by Galois cohomology.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Forms of algebraic groups.** The forms of a split reductive group $G_{split}$ over a field $k$ are classified by the Galois cohomology set $H^1(\\text{Gal}(\\bar{k}/k), \\text{Aut}(G_{split}))$. For the finite field $k=\\mathbb{F}_q$, the Galois group is generated by the Frobenius automorphism $F: x \\mapsto x^q$.\n\nThe automorphism group of a simple algebraic group fits into the exact sequence:\n$1 \\to \\text{Inn}(G) \\to \\text{Aut}(G) \\to \\text{Out}(G) \\to 1$\nwhere $\\text{Inn}(G)$ is the group of inner automorphisms and $\\text{Out}(G)$ is the group of outer automorphisms, which is isomorphic to the group of symmetries of the Dynkin diagram.\n\nFor the root system of type $E_8$, the Dynkin diagram is:\n```\n      o\n      |\no-o-o-o-o-o-o\n```\nThis diagram has no non-trivial symmetries. Therefore, the group of outer automorphisms $\\text{Out}(G)$ is trivial. This means $\\text{Aut}(G) = \\text{Inn}(G)$. For a group of type $E_8$, the center is trivial, so the group is of adjoint type, and $\\text{Inn}(G) \\cong G$.\n\nThe set of forms of $E_8$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is thus given by $H^1(\\mathbb{F}_q, G)$. By Lang's theorem, for any connected algebraic group $H$ over a finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$, the cohomology set $H^1(\\mathbb{F}_q, H)$ is trivial.\n\nThis implies that there is only one form of a group of type $E_8$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ up to isomorphism, and this form is the *split* one.\n\n### Step 2: Relate maximal tori to the Weyl group\nThere is a fundamental theorem that classifies the rational maximal tori of a reductive group defined over $\\mathbb{F}_q$. It states that the set of $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$-conjugacy classes of maximal tori of $G$ defined over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is in one-to-one correspondence with the set of so-called $F$-conjugacy classes of the Weyl group $W$.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: $F$-conjugacy.** Let $W$ be the Weyl group of $G$, and let $F$ be the Frobenius endomorphism. The action of $F$ on $W$ is induced by the action of the Galois group on the root datum. Two elements $w_1, w_2 \\in W$ are said to be in the same $F$-conjugacy class if there exists an element $x \\in W$ such that $w_2 = x w_1 F(x)^{-1}$.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Frobenius action on the Weyl group\nThe action of the Frobenius endomorphism $F$ on the Weyl group $W$ depends on whether the group $G$ is split or twisted.\nSince we established in Step 1 that $G$ must be the split form of $E_8$, the Frobenius endomorphism acts trivially on the root datum, and therefore acts trivially on the Weyl group $W$.\nSo, for any $x \\in W$, we have $F(x)=x$.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: The conjugacy condition simplifies.** With the trivial action of $F$, the condition for $F$-conjugacy becomes $w_2 = x w_1 x^{-1}$. This is precisely the definition of a standard conjugacy class in the group $W$.\n\nTherefore, the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori (up to $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$-conjugacy) is equal to the number of conjugacy classes in the Weyl group $W(E_8)$.\n\n### Step 4: Compute the number of conjugacy classes in $W(E_8)$\nThe final step is to find the number of conjugacy classes of the Weyl group $W(E_8)$. The group $W(E_8)$ is a very large finite group of order $|W(E_8)| = 2^{14} \\cdot 3^5 \\cdot 5^2 \\cdot 7 = 696,729,600$.\nThe number of its conjugacy classes is a known result in mathematics, primarily from the study of Lie theory and reflection groups.\n\n*   **Careful Point 4: Sourcing the correct number.** This value is not trivial to compute from scratch. It is a well-established result found in seminal literature and confirmed by computer algebra systems. For instance, in R.W. Carter's paper \"Conjugacy Classes in the Weyl Group\" (Compositio Mathematica, 1972), the number of conjugacy classes for each exceptional Weyl group is provided. For $W(E_8)$, this number is 112. This result is standard and cited in numerous other works on representation theory and finite groups of Lie type.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nThe number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori in a reductive group of type $E_8$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is independent of $q$ and is equal to the number of conjugacy classes in the Weyl group $W(E_8)$. This number is 112.\n\n<<<112>>>"
