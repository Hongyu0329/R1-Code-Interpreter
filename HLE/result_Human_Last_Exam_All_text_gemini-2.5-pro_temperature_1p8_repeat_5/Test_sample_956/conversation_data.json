    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n### Step 1: Identify the group G\n\nThe group $G$ is generated by three permutations, $a, b, c$, on a set of 12 elements. We first analyze the properties of these generators and the group $G$.\n\n1.  **Check the parity of the generators:**\n    *   $a = (1, 3, 2, 5, 4, 7, 6, 9, 8, y, x)$ is an 11-cycle. A $k$-cycle is an even permutation if $k$ is odd. Since 11 is odd, $a$ is an even permutation.\n    *   $b = (1, 8, 5, 9)(4, x, 7, 6)$ is a product of two 4-cycles. A 4-cycle is an odd permutation. The product of two odd permutations is an even permutation. So, $b$ is even.\n    *   $c = (1, 2)(3, z)(4, 8)(5, 6)(7, y)(9, x)$ is a product of six 2-cycles (transpositions). A product of an even number of transpositions is an even permutation. So, $c$ is even.\n    *   Since all generators of $G$ are even permutations, $G$ is a subgroup of the alternating group $A_{12}$.\n\n2.  **Determine the properties of G:**\n    *   **Transitivity:** The generator $a$ connects the 11 elements $\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, x, y\\}$ in a single cycle. The element $z$ is fixed by $a$. The generator $c$ maps $3$ to $z$ (and vice versa). This means that $z$ is in the same orbit as the other 11 elements. Therefore, $G$ acts transitively on the set of 12 elements.\n    *   **Primitivity:** A transitive permutation group of degree $n$ which contains a cycle of prime length $p$ such that $p > n/2$ is primitive. Here, the degree is $n=12$. The group $G$ contains the element $a$, which is a cycle of prime length $p=11$. Since $11 > 12/2 = 6$, the group $G$ is primitive.\n\n3.  **Classify the group G:**\n    *   We have established that $G$ is a primitive subgroup of $A_{12}$ that contains an 11-cycle. The primitive groups of degree 12 are known. The ones containing an 11-cycle are $PSL(2, 11)$, $M_{12}$, and $A_{12}$. (The symmetric group $S_{12}$ is also a possibility, but we already know $G \\le A_{12}$).\n    *   The group $PSL(2, 11)$ has elements of orders dividing 11, $(11-1)/2=5$, and $(11+1)/2=6$. Its possible element orders are 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 11. It does not contain elements of order 4. Our generator $b$ has order 4. Thus, $G$ is not $PSL(2, 11)$.\n    *   The candidates for $G$ are now $M_{12}$ and $A_{12}$. We can distinguish between them by checking the cycle structures of their elements. Let's find the full cycle structure of the generator $b$ on the set of 12 elements.\n    *   $b = (1, 8, 5, 9)(4, x, 7, 6)$. The elements not appearing in the cycles are $\\{2, 3, y, z\\}$. These are fixed points of $b$.\n    *   So, the permutation $b$ consists of two 4-cycles and four 1-cycles (fixed points). Its cycle structure is denoted as $4^2 1^4$.\n    *   The cycle structures of elements in the Mathieu group $M_{12}$ are well-documented. They are: $1^{12}$, $2^4 1^4$, $2^6$, $3^4$, $3^3 1^3$, $4^2 2^1 1^2$, $4^1 2^2 1^4$, $5^2 1^2$, $6^2$, $6^1 3^1 2^1 1^1$, $8^1 4^1$, $10^1 2^1$, $11^1 1^1$.\n    *   Comparing the cycle structure of $b$ ($4^2 1^4$) with this list, we see that it does not appear. This means that $M_{12}$ does not contain any element with this cycle structure.\n    *   Since $G$ contains the element $b$, $G$ cannot be isomorphic to $M_{12}$.\n    *   The only remaining possibility for $G$ is the alternating group $A_{12}$.\n\n### Step 2: Find the Schur Multiplier of G\n\nNow that we have identified $G \\cong A_{12}$, we need to find its Schur multiplier, which is denoted by $A$.\n\n*   The Schur multiplier of the alternating group $A_n$, denoted $M(A_n)$, is a standard result in group theory.\n*   For $n \\ge 8$ and $n \\neq 6, 7$, the Schur multiplier $M(A_n)$ is the cyclic group of order 2, $C_2$. The cases $n=6$ and $n=7$ are exceptional, having a Schur multiplier of $C_6$.\n*   In our case, $n=12$, which satisfies $n \\ge 8$.\n*   Therefore, the Schur multiplier $A$ of $G=A_{12}$ is $C_2$. $A \\cong C_2$.\n\n### Step 3: Count the number of proper subgroups of A up to isomorphism\n\nThe final step is to count the number of proper subgroups of $A=C_2$, up to isomorphism.\n\n*   The group $A=C_2$ is the cyclic group of order 2. Let its elements be $\\{e, g\\}$, where $e$ is the identity and $g^2 = e$.\n*   The subgroups of $C_2$ are:\n    1.  The trivial subgroup $\\{e\\}$.\n    2.  The entire group $\\{e, g\\} = C_2$.\n*   A *proper* subgroup of a group is any subgroup except the group itself.\n*   The only proper subgroup of $C_2$ is the trivial subgroup $\\{e\\}$.\n*   The question asks for the number of proper subgroups *up to isomorphism*. This means we count the number of non-isomorphic structures that the proper subgroups can have.\n*   The only proper subgroup is $\\{e\\}$, which is isomorphic to the trivial group (sometimes denoted $C_1$).\n*   Thus, there is only one isomorphism class for the proper subgroups of $A$.\n\nThe number of proper subgroups of $A$ up to isomorphism is 1."
