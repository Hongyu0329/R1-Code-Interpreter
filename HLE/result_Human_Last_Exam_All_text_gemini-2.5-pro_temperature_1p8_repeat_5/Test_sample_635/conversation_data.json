    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find a left coprime factorization of the given transfer function.\n\n**1. Understand the problem and define the goal.**\nWe are asked to find a left coprime factorization of the transfer function matrix:\n\\[\nH(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{s-1}{s+1} & 1 \\\\ \\frac{2}{s^2-1} & 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nThis means we need to find two polynomial matrices, $D(s)$ and $N(s)$, that satisfy the following conditions:\n1.  $H(s) = D^{-1}(s)N(s)$.\n2.  The determinant of $D(s)$ is not identically zero, i.e., $\\det(D(s)) \\not\\equiv 0$.\n3.  $D(s)$ and $N(s)$ are left coprime. This means the matrix $[D(s) \\quad N(s)]$ has full row rank for all complex numbers $s$.\n\n**2. Relate D(s) and N(s) through H(s).**\nFrom the relation $H(s) = D^{-1}(s)N(s)$, we can write $D(s)H(s) = N(s)$. Let's write this out explicitly with a general polynomial matrix $D(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} d_{11}(s) & d_{12}(s) \\\\ d_{21}(s) & d_{22}(s) \\end{bmatrix}$.\n\n\\[\nN(s) = D(s)H(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} d_{11}(s) & d_{12}(s) \\\\ d_{21}(s) & d_{22}(s) \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{s-1}{s+1} & 1 \\\\ \\frac{2}{s^2-1} & 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nMultiplying the matrices gives the elements of $N(s)$:\n\\[\nN(s) = \\begin{bmatrix}\nd_{11}(s) \\frac{s-1}{s+1} + d_{12}(s) \\frac{2}{s^2-1} & d_{11}(s) \\\\\nd_{21}(s) \\frac{s-1}{s+1} + d_{22}(s) \\frac{2}{s^2-1} & d_{21}(s)\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\n**3. Determine the conditions for N(s) to be a polynomial matrix.**\nFor $N(s)$ to be a polynomial matrix, all its elements must be polynomials.\n*   From $N_{12}(s)$ and $N_{22}(s)$, it is clear that $d_{11}(s)$ and $d_{21}(s)$ must be polynomials.\n*   For $N_{11}(s)$ to be a polynomial, we combine the terms over the least common denominator, which is $s^2-1 = (s-1)(s+1)$:\n    \\[\n    N_{11}(s) = \\frac{d_{11}(s)(s-1)^2 + 2d_{12}(s)}{(s-1)(s+1)}\n    \\]\n    For this to be a polynomial, the numerator must be divisible by both $(s-1)$ and $(s+1)$. This means the numerator must be zero at $s=1$ and $s=-1$.\n    *   At $s=1$: $d_{11}(1)(1-1)^2 + 2d_{12}(1) = 0 \\implies 2d_{12}(1) = 0 \\implies d_{12}(1)=0$.\n    *   At $s=-1$: $d_{11}(-1)(-1-1)^2 + 2d_{12}(-1) = 0 \\implies 4d_{11}(-1) + 2d_{12}(-1) = 0$.\n*   Similarly, for $N_{21}(s)$ to be a polynomial:\n    \\[\n    N_{21}(s) = \\frac{d_{21}(s)(s-1)^2 + 2d_{22}(s)}{(s-1)(s+1)}\n    \\]\n    The numerator must be zero at $s=1$ and $s=-1$.\n    *   At $s=1$: $d_{21}(1)(1-1)^2 + 2d_{22}(1) = 0 \\implies 2d_{22}(1) = 0 \\implies d_{22}(1)=0$.\n    *   At $s=-1$: $d_{21}(-1)(-1-1)^2 + 2d_{22}(-1) = 0 \\implies 4d_{21}(-1) + 2d_{22}(-1) = 0$.\n\n**4. Construct the simplest possible polynomial matrix D(s).**\nWe now have a set of conditions for the elements of $D(s)$. We want to find the simplest non-trivial polynomials that satisfy these conditions, ensuring $\\det(D(s)) \\not\\equiv 0$.\n*   From $d_{12}(1)=0$, $d_{12}(s)$ must have a factor of $(s-1)$. Let's make the simplest choice: $d_{12}(s) = 0$.\n*   With $d_{12}(s)=0$, the condition $4d_{11}(-1) + 2d_{12}(-1) = 0$ simplifies to $4d_{11}(-1)=0$, so $d_{11}(-1)=0$. This means $d_{11}(s)$ must have a factor of $(s+1)$. Let's choose the simplest form: $d_{11}(s) = s+1$.\n*   From $d_{22}(1)=0$, $d_{22}(s)$ must have a factor of $(s-1)$. Let's choose the simplest non-zero form: $d_{22}(s) = s-1$.\n*   With $d_{22}(s)=s-1$, the condition $4d_{21}(-1) + 2d_{22}(-1) = 0$ becomes $4d_{21}(-1) + 2(-1-1) = 0$, which is $4d_{21}(-1) - 4 = 0$, so $d_{21}(-1)=1$. We need to find a simple polynomial for $d_{21}(s)$ satisfying this. Let's try a first-degree polynomial $d_{21}(s)=as+b$. Then $a(-1)+b=1 \\implies b-a=1$. The simplest choice is $a=-1, b=0$, which gives $d_{21}(s) = -s$.\n\nSo, we have constructed a candidate matrix $D(s)$:\n\\[\nD(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} s+1 & 0 \\\\ -s & s-1 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nThe determinant is $\\det(D(s)) = (s+1)(s-1) - 0 = s^2-1$, which is not identically zero. So this is a valid candidate for $D(s)$.\n\n**5. Calculate the corresponding N(s).**\nUsing the chosen $D(s)$, we calculate the elements of $N(s) = D(s)H(s)$:\n*   $N_{11}(s) = (s+1) \\frac{s-1}{s+1} + 0 = s-1$.\n*   $N_{12}(s) = d_{11}(s) = s+1$.\n*   $N_{21}(s) = (-s)\\frac{s-1}{s+1} + (s-1)\\frac{2}{s^2-1} = \\frac{-s(s-1)^2+2(s-1)}{(s-1)(s+1)} = \\frac{(s-1)(-s(s-1)+2)}{(s-1)(s+1)} = \\frac{-s^2+s+2}{s+1} = \\frac{-(s-2)(s+1)}{s+1} = 2-s$.\n*   $N_{22}(s) = d_{21}(s) = -s$.\n\nThis gives the numerator matrix:\n\\[\nN(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} s-1 & s+1 \\\\ 2-s & -s \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\n**6. Verify the coprimeness condition.**\nTo confirm that $D(s)$ and $N(s)$ are left coprime, we must check that the matrix $[D(s) \\quad N(s)]$ has full row rank (rank 2) for all complex values of $s$. The rank can only drop at values of $s$ where $\\det(D(s))=0$, which are $s=1$ and $s=-1$.\nThe concatenated matrix is:\n\\[\n[D(s) \\quad N(s)] = \\begin{bmatrix} s+1 & 0 & s-1 & s+1 \\\\ -s & s-1 & 2-s & -s \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n*   For $s=1$:\n    \\[\n    [D(1) \\quad N(1)] = \\begin{bmatrix} 2 & 0 & 0 & 2 \\\\ -1 & 0 & 1 & -1 \\end{bmatrix}\n    \\]\n    The two rows are linearly independent (e.g., the determinant of the submatrix formed by columns 1 and 3 is $2 \\cdot 1 - 0 \\cdot (-1) = 2 \\neq 0$). The rank is 2.\n*   For $s=-1$:\n    \\[\n    [D(-1) \\quad N(-1)] = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 & -2 & 0 \\\\ 1 & -2 & 3 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}\n    \\]\n    The two rows are clearly linearly independent. The rank is 2.\n\nSince the rank is full for all critical values of $s$, the matrices $D(s)$ and $N(s)$ are left coprime.\n\n**Final Answer.**\nA left coprime factorization $H(s) = D^{-1}(s)N(s)$ is given by:\n\\[\nD(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} s+1 & 0 \\\\ -s & s-1 \\end{bmatrix} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad N(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} s-1 & s+1 \\\\ 2-s & -s \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\n<<<\n$D(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} s+1 & 0 \\\\ -s & s-1 \\end{bmatrix}$, $N(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} s-1 & s+1 \\\\ 2-s & -s \\end{bmatrix}$\n>>>"
