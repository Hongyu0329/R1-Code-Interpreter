    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Algebra and the Problem's Context\n\nThe problem concerns the representation theory of the quantum group $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$ where $q$ is a primitive third root of unity, i.e., $q = e^{2\\pi i/3}$. The category $C$ consists of all indecomposable finite-dimensional representations of this algebra. We need to find what percentage of these objects (up to isomorphism) are irreducible.\n\nThe algebra $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$ is generated by four elements $E, F, K, K^{-1}$ subject to the relations:\n$KK^{-1} = K^{-1}K = 1$\n$KEK^{-1} = q^2E$\n$KFK^{-1} = q^{-2}F$\n$[E, F] = \\frac{K - K^{-1}}{q - q^{-1}}$\n\n### Careful Point 1: The Significance of $q$ being a Root of Unity\n\nThe representation theory of $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$ is drastically different when $q$ is a root of unity compared to when it is not. When $q$ is a primitive $l$-th root of unity (here $l=3$), the elements $E^l, F^l, K^l$ are in the center of the algebra.\n\n*   **Center of the Algebra:** Let $Z(u_q)$ be the center of $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$. For $q=e^{2\\pi i/3}$, the elements $E^3, F^3, K^3$ are central. The center is a polynomial algebra generated by these three elements and the quantum Casimir element.\n*   **Action on Indecomposables:** By a generalization of Schur's Lemma, central elements must act as scalars on any finite-dimensional *indecomposable* representation. That is, for an indecomposable module $V$, there exist scalars $c_E, c_F, c_K \\in \\mathbb{C}$ such that $E^3$ acts as multiplication by $c_E$, $F^3$ acts by $c_F$, and $K^3$ acts by $c_K$. This allows us to classify representations based on the scalars by which the central elements act.\n\n### Step 2: Classifying Indecomposable Representations\n\nThe classification of indecomposable modules for $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$ is determined by the action of its center. We can divide the representations into two main families based on whether $E^3$ and $F^3$ act as zero or not.\n\n#### Case A: Representations where $E^3$ and $F^3$ act as zero ($c_E = c_F = 0$)\n\nThese representations are effectively representations of the \"small quantum group\" $u_q^{(0)}$, which is the quotient of $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$ by the ideal generated by $E^3, F^3$ and $K^3-c_K$ for some scalar $c_K$.\n\nFor $l=3$, the classification of indecomposable modules for the small quantum group is well-known. For each non-zero scalar $\\lambda$ by which $K^3$ acts, there are exactly four isomorphism classes of indecomposable modules:\n\n1.  **$L(1, \\lambda)$:** A 1-dimensional irreducible module.\n2.  **$L(2, \\lambda)$:** A 2-dimensional irreducible module.\n3.  **$P(1, \\lambda)$:** A 3-dimensional indecomposable module which is the projective cover of $L(1, \\lambda)$. It is an extension of $L(1, \\lambda)$ by $L(2, \\lambda)$ (specifically, $0 \\to L(2, \\lambda) \\to P(1, \\lambda) \\to L(1, \\lambda) \\to 0$). This module is **reducible**.\n4.  **$P(2, \\lambda)$:** A 3-dimensional indecomposable module which is the projective cover of $L(2, \\lambda)$. It is an extension of $L(2, \\lambda)$ by $L(1, \\lambda)$ (specifically, $0 \\to L(1, \\lambda) \\to P(2, \\lambda) \\to L(2, \\lambda) \\to 0$). This module is also **reducible**.\n\n*   **Analysis for Case A:** For any choice of central character corresponding to this case, there are 4 types of indecomposable modules. Among them, 2 are irreducible ($L(1,\\lambda), L(2,\\lambda)$) and 2 are reducible ($P(1,\\lambda), P(2,\\lambda)$).\n*   **Percentage for Case A:** The percentage of irreducible objects in this specific family is $2/4 = 50\\%$.\n\n#### Case B: Representations where $E^3$ and $F^3$ do not both act as zero ($c_E \\neq 0$ or $c_F \\neq 0$)\n\nIt can be shown that if one of $c_E$ or $c_F$ is non-zero, the other must be non-zero as well. These modules are called **cyclic representations**.\n\n*   **Key Property:** A major theorem in the representation theory of $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$ at a root of unity states that all of these cyclic representations are **irreducible**.\n*   These modules are typically 3-dimensional (since $l=3$). They are parameterized by the non-zero scalars $c_E, c_F$ and the scalar $c_K$ (subject to a polynomial relation connecting them which arises from the relation for the Casimir element).\n*   **Analysis for Case B:** In this family of representations, every indecomposable module is irreducible.\n*   **Percentage for Case B:** The percentage of irreducible objects is $100\\%$.\n\n### Careful Point 2: Interpreting \"Percentage of the Objects of C\"\n\nThe question asks for a single percentage for the entire category $C$. We have found that the answer is 50% for one family of objects and 100% for another. To get a single answer, we must consider the relative \"size\" or \"prevalence\" of these two families.\n\nThis is best understood by looking at the parameter space of all indecomposable modules. As noted, each indecomposable module corresponds to a central character, which is a point in a space parameterized by the eigenvalues of the central elements.\n\n1.  The space of all central characters forms a 2-dimensional algebraic variety (a surface).\n2.  The central characters corresponding to Case A (where $c_E = c_F = 0$) form a subvariety of this space. The condition $c_E=0, c_F=0$ reduces the dimension of the parameter space. This subvariety is 1-dimensional (a curve on the surface of all central characters).\n3.  The central characters corresponding to Case B (the generic case) form the complement of this curve, which is an open, dense subset of the 2-dimensional surface.\n\n### Step 3: Drawing the Final Conclusion\n\nWhen we talk about the \"percentage of objects\", we are essentially asking: if we pick an indecomposable module at random, what is the probability that it is irreducible?\n\n*   The set of modules that have a chance to be reducible (the family from Case A) is parameterized by a space of dimension 1.\n*   The set of all modules is parameterized by a space of dimension 2.\n\nIn mathematics, a lower-dimensional subvariety is considered a \"measure zero\" subset of the larger variety. This means that the probability of randomly picking a point that lies on the curve (Case A) from the surface (all cases) is zero.\n\nTherefore, \"almost all\" indecomposable representations belong to Case B, where every object is irreducible. The set of reducible indecomposable modules is negligibly small compared to the set of irreducible ones.\n\nThe percentage of objects in $C$ that are irreducible is therefore 100%.\n\n### Summary of careful points:\n1.  The representation theory is governed by the center of the algebra, which becomes large when $q$ is a root of unity.\n2.  Indecomposable representations are classified by their central character.\n3.  Reducible indecomposable modules only exist for a special, lower-dimensional set of central characters ($c_E=c_F=0$).\n4.  For the \"generic\" central character, all indecomposable modules are irreducible.\n5.  Interpreting the \"percentage\" question requires comparing the sizes of the parameter spaces for these different types of modules. The parameter space for reducible objects is of a strictly smaller dimension than the parameter space for all objects.\n\nFinal conclusion: The set of reducible indecomposable objects is a \"measure zero\" subset of the set of all indecomposable objects. Thus, 100% of the objects are irreducible in this sense.\n\n<<<100>>>"
