    "An analysis of the connectivity of the map $f: \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the connectivity of the source and target spaces.**\n\nLet $X = \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$ be the source space and $Y = \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$ be the target space. We use the property that if a space $A$ is $k$-connected, its suspension $\\Sigma A$ is $(k+1)$-connected, and its loop space $\\Omega A$ is $(k-1)$-connected. Also, if $A$ is $k$-connected and $B$ is $l$-connected, their smash product $A \\wedge B$ is $(k+l+1)$-connected.\n\n*   **Connectivity of the source space X:**\n    1.  The n-sphere $S^n$ is $(n-1)$-connected.\n    2.  The loop space $\\Omega S^n$ is $(n-2)$-connected.\n    3.  $\\Omega S^4$ is $(4-2) = 2$-connected. Its first non-trivial homotopy group is $\\pi_3(\\Omega S^4) = \\pi_4(S^4) = \\mathbb{Z}$.\n    4.  $\\Omega S^6$ is $(6-2) = 4$-connected. Its first non-trivial homotopy group is $\\pi_5(\\Omega S^6) = \\pi_6(S^6) = \\mathbb{Z}$.\n    5.  The smash product $\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6$ is $(2+4+1) = 7$-connected.\n    6.  The suspension $\\Sigma (\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$ is $(7+1) = 8$-connected.\n    *Careful point:* Let's verify the first non-trivial homotopy group of the source. By the Freudenthal suspension theorem, $\\pi_9(X) = \\pi_9(\\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)) \\cong \\pi_8(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$. Since $\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6$ is 7-connected, we can use the Hurewicz theorem. The first non-trivial homotopy group is isomorphic to the first non-trivial homology group. $H_8(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\cong H_3(\\Omega S^4) \\otimes H_5(\\Omega S^6) = \\mathbb{Z} \\otimes \\mathbb{Z} = \\mathbb{Z}$. So, $\\pi_9(X) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n*   **Connectivity of the target space Y:**\n    1.  The smash product $S^4 \\wedge S^6$ is homotopy equivalent to $S^{4+6} = S^{10}$. This is because the CW complex for $S^n$ is $e^0 \\cup e^n$, so $S^4 \\wedge S^6 = (S^4 \\times S^6) / (S^4 \\vee S^6)$ has a cell structure $e^0 \\cup e^{10}$, which is $S^{10}$.\n    2.  The target space is $Y = \\Omega(S^{10})$.\n    3.  $S^{10}$ is $(10-1)=9$-connected.\n    4.  The loop space $\\Omega S^{10}$ is $(9-1)=8$-connected.\n    *Careful point:* The first non-trivial homotopy group of the target is $\\pi_9(Y) = \\pi_9(\\Omega S^{10}) = \\pi_{10}(S^{10}) = \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n**Step 2: Use the definition of connectivity for a map.**\n\nA map $f: X \\to Y$ is called $k$-connected if the induced map on homotopy groups, $f_*: \\pi_i(X) \\to \\pi_i(Y)$, is an isomorphism for all $i < k$ and a surjection for $i = k$. This is equivalent to saying that the homotopy fiber of $f$ is $(k-1)$-connected.\n\n*   Both the source space $X = \\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$ and the target space $Y = \\Omega S^{10}$ are 8-connected. This means that for $i \\leq 8$, $\\pi_i(X) = 0$ and $\\pi_i(Y) = 0$.\n*   Therefore, the map $f_*: \\pi_i(X) \\to \\pi_i(Y)$ is an isomorphism (of trivial groups) for all $i \\leq 8$. By definition, this means the map $f$ is at least 8-connected.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the map on the first non-trivial homotopy group.**\n\nThe connectivity of the map $f$ is determined by its behavior on the first non-trivial dimension, which is $i=9$.\nWe need to analyze the map $f_*: \\pi_9(X) \\to \\pi_9(Y)$.\nWe found that $\\pi_9(X) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$ and $\\pi_9(Y) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\nSo, $f_*$ is a homomorphism from $\\mathbb{Z}$ to $\\mathbb{Z}$, which must be of the form $f_*(n) = d \\cdot n$ for some integer $d$.\n\n*   **Case 1: $d = \\pm 1$.** In this case, $f_*$ is an isomorphism on $\\pi_9$. If it were an isomorphism on all higher homotopy groups as well, it would be a homotopy equivalence. Let's check $\\pi_{10}$.\n    $\\pi_{10}(X) = \\pi_{10}(\\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)) = \\pi_9(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$. This group is generally not trivial. In fact, using mod 2 homology, $H_*(\\Omega S^{2k};\\mathbb{Z}/2) = \\mathbb{Z}/2[x_{2k-1}]$, so $H_9(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6; \\mathbb{Z}/2) = \\bigoplus_{i+j=9} H_i(\\Omega S^4) \\otimes H_j(\\Omega S^6) = 0$. While this suggests $\\pi_9(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$ might have no 2-torsion, this does not mean it is trivial.\n    $\\pi_{10}(Y) = \\pi_{10}(\\Omega S^{10}) = \\pi_{11}(S^{10}) = \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n    Since the homotopy groups are not isomorphic (e.g. $\\pi_9$ is $\\mathbb{Z}$ for both, but $\\pi_{10}(X)$ cannot be $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ since the space is a suspension), the spaces $X$ and $Y$ are not homotopy equivalent. Therefore, $f$ cannot be a homotopy equivalence, so we must have $d \\neq \\pm 1$.\n\n*   **Case 2: $d \\neq \\pm 1$.** In this case, the map $f_*: \\pi_9(X) \\to \\pi_9(Y)$ is not an isomorphism. In particular, if $d=0$ or $|d|>1$, the map is not surjective. According to the definition of connectivity, if $f_*$ is an isomorphism for $i<k$ but not a surjection for $i=k$, the map is $(k-1)$-connected.\n    Here, $f_*$ is an isomorphism for $i < 9$, but it is not surjective for $i=9$. Therefore, the connectivity of the map is $9-1 = 8$.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe source and target spaces are both 8-connected. The map $f$ induces an isomorphism on $\\pi_i$ for $i < 9$ because the groups are trivial. At dimension 9, the map is a homomorphism $\\mathbb{Z} \\to \\mathbb{Z}$. As the spaces are not homotopy equivalent, this homomorphism cannot be an isomorphism (i.e., multiplication by $\\pm 1$). Thus, the map is not surjective on $\\pi_9$. This implies the connectivity of the map is exactly 8.\n\nThe specific integer `d` for the map on $\\pi_9$ is a higher-order Hopf invariant. Regardless of its specific value (as long as it's not $\\pm 1$), the conclusion about the connectivity remains the same. The canonical map of this type is known to be non-trivial."
