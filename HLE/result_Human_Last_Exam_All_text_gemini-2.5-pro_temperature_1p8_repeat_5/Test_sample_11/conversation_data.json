    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the first statute in the modern State of Israel that explicitly introduced the concept of \"good faith.\"\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Statute:** We are looking for a law passed by the legislature. In the context of the modern State of Israel, this means a law enacted by the Knesset.\n    *   **First:** The key is to find the earliest chronological example.\n    *   **Modern State of Israel:** This refers to the period after the state's establishment in 1948.\n    *   **Explicitly introduce:** The statute must use the specific term \"good faith,\" which in Hebrew is \"תום לב\" (tom lev). It is not enough for the statute to contain related ideas like fairness or equity; it must use the explicit phrase.\n\n2.  **Initial Research into Israeli Civil Law:**\n    *   The principle of \"good faith\" is famously and most prominently established as a foundational, \"super-principle\" of Israeli law in the **Contracts (General Part) Law, 5733-1973**. Sections 12 and 39 of this law impose a general duty to act in good faith in negotiations and in the performance of contractual obligations.\n    *   However, the question asks for the *first* statute, and the 1973 Contracts Law was the culmination of a legislative trend, not its beginning. We must therefore look at earlier statutes.\n\n3.  **Investigating Pre-1973 Statutes:**\n    *   A wave of new, original Israeli civil legislation was enacted in the 1960s to replace the patchwork of Ottoman and British Mandatory law. Several of these statutes include the term \"good faith\" (`תום לב`).\n    *   **Land Law, 5729-1969:** Uses \"good faith\" in the context of competing property transactions.\n    *   **Sale Law, 5728-1968:** Uses \"good faith\" to protect a buyer in certain circumstances (e.g., market overt).\n    *   **Pledge Law, 5727-1967:** Uses \"good faith\" in relation to the pledgee's rights against other creditors.\n    *   **Guarantees Law, 5727-1967:** Also contains the concept.\n    *   Comparing the enactment dates of the 1967 statutes reveals that the **Pledge Law** was passed slightly before the Guarantees Law. This makes the Pledge Law the first *original* piece of modern Israeli civil legislation to use the term.\n\n4.  **Broadening the Scope to \"New Version\" Statutes:**\n    *   The analysis cannot stop with the original laws of the 1960s. After 1948, the Knesset undertook a project to produce official, binding Hebrew versions of many British Mandatory Ordinances that were still in force. These were called \"New Versions\" (`נוסח חדש`) and were themselves considered legislative acts of the Knesset.\n    *   We must check if any of these earlier \"New Versions\" explicitly use the term `תום לב`.\n    *   The **Bills of Exchange Ordinance [New Version], 5717-1957**, is the binding Hebrew text of the original English Mandatory Ordinance. The concept of a \"holder in due course\" in English law requires that the holder took the bill \"in good faith.\" The official 1957 Hebrew version enacted by the Knesset translated this term explicitly as `בתום לב`.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   While the 1960s laws, like the Pledge Law, were the first *original Israeli statutes* to introduce the concept as part of the codification of Israel's independent civil law, they were not the absolute first statutes enacted by the Knesset to contain the explicit term.\n    *   The **Bills of Exchange Ordinance [New Version]** was enacted by the Knesset in **1957**, a full decade before the Pledge Law. By producing a binding Hebrew text that included the term `תום לב`, this became the first statute of the modern State of Israel to explicitly feature the concept of \"good faith.\"\n\n### Careful Points to Note:\n\n*   **Original Law vs. New Version:** It is crucial to distinguish between a new, original law drafted by the Israeli legislature (like the Pledge Law) and a \"New Version\" which is a Knesset-approved Hebrew translation of a pre-existing Mandatory Ordinance. The question asks for the first \"statute in the modern State of Israel,\" which includes these \"New Version\" legislative acts.\n*   **\"Introduce\" vs. \"Establish as a General Principle\":** The question asks when the concept was \"introduced,\" not when it was elevated to a general, overarching principle of the entire legal system. The latter happened with the Contracts Law of 1973, but the introduction in a specific statutory context occurred much earlier.\n*   **Explicit Language:** The analysis hinges on finding the explicit Hebrew term `תום לב`, not just related concepts like \"loyalty\" (`נאמנות`) found in the Agency Law of 1965.\n\nBy following this chronological and textual analysis, the earliest statute is identified.\n\n<<<Bills of Exchange Ordinance [New Version]>>>"
