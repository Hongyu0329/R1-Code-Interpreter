No, free-standing boron nanosheets would not be expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric downconversion (SPDC). This is because SPDC is a second-order nonlinear optical process that requires the material to have a non-zero second-order nonlinear susceptibility ($\chi^{(2)}$). A material can only possess a bulk $\chi^{(2)}$ if its crystal structure lacks inversion symmetry (i.e., is non-centrosymmetric). Ideal, crystalline boron nanosheets in their common stable forms are centrosymmetric, meaning they possess inversion symmetry. This fundamental symmetry forbids second-order nonlinear effects, making their intrinsic $\chi^{(2)}$ zero.
