    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Core Concepts**\n\n*   **Spontaneous Parametric Downconversion (SPDC):** This is a quantum optical phenomenon and a key process for generating entangled photon pairs. In SPDC, a high-energy photon (called the \"pump\" photon) passes through a specific type of material and, with some probability, spontaneously splits into two lower-energy photons (called the \"signal\" and \"idler\" photons). The process must conserve both energy and momentum.\n*   **Nonlinear Optics:** SPDC is a *second-order nonlinear optical process*. The optical response of a material to an incident electric field (E) can be described by the induced polarization (P). In nonlinear optics, this relationship is expressed as a power series:\n    $P = \\epsilon_0 (\\chi^{(1)}E + \\chi^{(2)}E^2 + \\chi^{(3)}E^3 + ...)$\n    *   $\\chi^{(1)}$ governs linear optics (refraction, absorption).\n    *   $\\chi^{(2)}$ is the second-order nonlinear susceptibility, responsible for processes like SPDC and second-harmonic generation (SHG).\n    *   $\\chi^{(3)}$ is the third-order nonlinear susceptibility.\n*   **Boron Nanosheets (Borophene):** These are two-dimensional (2D), single-atom-thick sheets of boron atoms, analogous to graphene. They exhibit various crystalline arrangements (polymorphs), with the most common synthesized forms being the $\\beta_{12}$ and $\\chi_3$ phases.\n\n**2. Identify the Necessary Condition for SPDC**\n\nThe crucial requirement for a material to exhibit SPDC is that it must have a **non-zero second-order nonlinear susceptibility, $\\chi^{(2)}$**.\n\n**3. Analyze the Symmetry Requirements for a Non-Zero $\\chi^{(2)}$**\n\n*   There is a fundamental rule in physics that links a material's properties to its crystal symmetry.\n*   For the second-order susceptibility $\\chi^{(2)}$ to be non-zero in the bulk of a material, the material's crystal structure must **lack inversion symmetry**.\n*   A material has inversion symmetry if its structure remains unchanged when inverted through a central point (i.e., if for every atom at position (x, y, z), there is an identical atom at (-x, -y, -z)). Such materials are called **centrosymmetric**.\n*   In a centrosymmetric material, the effects of a positive electric field and a negative electric field on the material's polarization must be equal and opposite in a specific way that cancels out all even-order nonlinear terms. As a result, $\\chi^{(2)}$ (and all other even-order susceptibilities) is zero.\n\n**4. Examine the Symmetry of Boron Nanosheets**\n\n*   The question specifies \"free-standing\" boron nanosheets, implying an ideal, suspended sheet without the influence of a substrate.\n*   We need to determine if the crystal structure of typical boron nanosheets is centrosymmetric or non-centrosymmetric.\n*   The most stable and commonly studied phases of borophene, including the planar triangular lattice and the buckled $\\beta_{12}$ and $\\chi_3$ phases, **are centrosymmetric**. They possess a center of inversion symmetry within their 2D lattice structure.\n\n**5. Draw the Conclusion**\n\n*   **Premise 1:** SPDC requires a non-zero $\\chi^{(2)}$.\n*   **Premise 2:** A non-zero bulk $\\chi^{(2)}$ requires a non-centrosymmetric crystal structure.\n*   **Premise 3:** Ideal, free-standing boron nanosheets are centrosymmetric.\n*   **Conclusion:** Therefore, due to their inherent crystal symmetry, ideal, free-standing boron nanosheets have a $\\chi^{(2)}$ of zero. This means they are not expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric downconversion.\n\n### List of Careful Points\n\n1.  **Ideal vs. Real Material:** The analysis assumes an ideal, defect-free, pristine nanosheet. In a real-world sample, factors like edges, defects, wrinkles, or strain can locally break the inversion symmetry. This could lead to a very weak, localized $\\chi^{(2)}$ effect, but it would not be an intrinsic property of the material and would be far less efficient than in a truly non-centrosymmetric material.\n2.  **Free-standing vs. Substrate-supported:** The question specifies \"free-standing\". If the borophene were on a substrate, the interaction with the substrate could break the symmetry and potentially induce a $\\chi^{(2)}$ response. This is a common technique to engineer nonlinear properties.\n3.  **Electric-Dipole Approximation:** This entire analysis is based on the electric-dipole interaction, which is the dominant mechanism. Higher-order contributions (like magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole) can lead to very weak second-order effects even in centrosymmetric materials, but these are typically many orders of magnitude weaker and are generally considered negligible for practical applications like SPDC.\n4.  **Distinction from Third-Order Processes:** Being centrosymmetric does not forbid third-order processes. Boron nanosheets, like all materials, have a non-zero $\\chi^{(3)}$ and can exhibit phenomena like third-harmonic generation and four-wave mixing. However, the question specifically asks about SPDC, which is a second-order ($\\chi^{(2)}$) process.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the answer is a definitive \"no\" for the ideal case described in the question. The core reason is the centrosymmetric nature of boron nanosheets, which forbids the second-order nonlinear process of SPDC due to fundamental symmetry constraints.\n\n<<<No, free-standing boron nanosheets would not be expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric downconversion (SPDC). This is because SPDC is a second-order nonlinear optical process that requires the material to have a non-zero second-order nonlinear susceptibility ($\\chi^{(2)}$). A material can only possess a bulk $\\chi^{(2)}$ if its crystal structure lacks inversion symmetry (i.e., is non-centrosymmetric). Ideal, crystalline boron nanosheets in their common stable forms are centrosymmetric, meaning they possess inversion symmetry. This fundamental symmetry forbids second-order nonlinear effects, making their intrinsic $\\chi^{(2)}$ zero.>>>"
