    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the first Academy Award Best Picture winner to depict a Luxor Obelisk.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core elements of the question.**\n*   **The Award:** We are only looking at winners of the \"Academy Award for Best Picture\".\n*   **The Object:** The film must depict a \"Luxor Obelisk\".\n*   **The Condition:** We need to find the \"first\" film in chronological order of winning that meets these criteria.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the locations of the Luxor Obelisks.**\nThere are two famous obelisks originally from the Luxor Temple in Egypt.\n1.  One obelisk remains at its original location in front of the **Luxor Temple in Luxor, Egypt**.\n2.  The other obelisk was gifted to France in the 19th century and now stands in the **Place de la Concorde in Paris, France**.\nA film can satisfy the condition by showing either of these two obelisks.\n\n**Step 3: Conduct a chronological review of Best Picture winners, looking for relevant settings.**\nWe must go through the list of winners year by year, starting from the first ceremony (1927/1928), and check their settings, specifically for scenes in Paris, France, or Luxor, Egypt.\n\n*   **1920s-1940s Analysis:**\n    *   Several early winners are set in Europe, but not in a way that would feature the obelisk. *Wings* (1928 winner) has scenes in Paris, but they are focused on wartime leave and do not feature landmarks like the Place de la Concorde.\n    *   *The Life of Emile Zola* (1937 winner) is set in Paris, but as a historical drama, its key public scenes (like the degradation of Captain Dreyfus) occur at the Ã‰cole Militaire, not the Place de la Concorde. The film focuses on interiors and does not function as a city travelogue.\n    *   *Casablanca* (1943 winner) famously features a flashback sequence set in Paris. However, this montage shows Rick and Ilsa near the Arc de Triomphe and the Seine, but not at the Place de la Concorde.\n    *   No winner from this period is set in Luxor, Egypt.\n\n*   **Continuing into the 1950s:**\n    *   **An American in Paris (1951 winner):** This musical is set entirely in Paris and celebrates the city's art and beauty. The film's stunning 17-minute climactic ballet sequence features Gene Kelly dancing through a series of elaborate, stylized sets inspired by the works of French painters. One of these backdrops explicitly depicts the Place de la Concorde, complete with its fountains and the Luxor Obelisk. This is a clear depiction.\n\n**Step 4: Verify if *An American in Paris* is indeed the first.**\nSince our chronological search has revealed no earlier winners depicting either the obelisk in Paris or the one in Luxor, *An American in Paris* (winner for the year 1951, awarded in 1952) is the first film to meet the criteria.\n\n**Step 5: Acknowledge subsequent winners.**\nLater films that won Best Picture, such as *Around the World in 80 Days* (1956) and *Gigi* (1958), also feature on-location footage of the Place de la Concorde and its obelisk. However, since they won after *An American in Paris*, they are not the *first*.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe first Academy Award for Best Picture winner to depict a Luxor Obelisk on-screen is *An American in Paris*, which showed the obelisk located in the Place de la Concorde during its famous final ballet sequence.\n\n<<<An American in Paris>>>"
