    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Subject:** Heart Rate (HR) and Heart Rate Variability (HRV) tracking.\n    *   **Technology:** Photoplethysmography (PPG) is used to capture \"beat-to-beat intervals\".\n    *   **Core Inquiry:** What is the specific name of the value measured *between* individual heartbeats, which is then used to compute HRV?\n\n2.  **Understand the Concepts:**\n    *   **Heart Rate (HR):** This is a measure of frequency, typically expressed in beats per minute (BPM). It is an average over a period of time.\n    *   **Heart Rate Variability (HRV):** This is not a measure of the heart rate itself, but the variation in time *between* consecutive heartbeats. High variability is generally a sign of a healthy, adaptable nervous system.\n    *   **Beat-to-beat Interval:** This is the literal time duration from one heartbeat to the next. For example, if your heart beats, then 900 milliseconds pass, then it beats again, that 900 ms is a beat-to-beat interval. The next interval might be 950 ms, and the one after that might be 880 ms. This variation is HRV.\n\n3.  **Identify the Technical Term:**\n    *   The question asks for the name of this \"beat-to-beat interval\" value.\n    *   While \"beat-to-beat interval\" is a correct description, there is a more common technical term used in physiology and signal processing.\n    *   This value is most widely known as the **Inter-Beat Interval (IBI)**.\n    *   When using an electrocardiogram (ECG), the peaks used for this measurement are the \"R\" waves in the QRS complex, so the value is specifically called an **R-R Interval**.\n    *   Since the question specifies PPG, which measures blood pulse, the interval is sometimes called a **Pulse-to-Pulse Interval (PPI)**. However, IBI is a more general and very common term that applies here.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Answer:**\n    *   HRV analysis starts with collecting a series of time durations between consecutive heartbeats.\n    *   Each of these individual time durations is the raw data point.\n    *   This data point is called the Inter-Beat Interval (IBI).\n    *   Therefore, the value computed between heartbeats to assess HRV is the Inter-Beat Interval.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **HR vs. HRV:** It is crucial to distinguish between Heart Rate (an average frequency) and HRV (the variation in timing between beats). You can have the same average heart rate of 60 BPM with very different HRV values.\n*   **Raw Data vs. Calculated Metric:** The question asks for the name of the raw measurement (the interval itself), not the final statistical metric that represents HRV (like SDNN or RMSSD). The IBI is the input for those calculations.\n*   **Technology Specificity (ECG vs. PPG):** While the physiological event is the same, the signal source can lead to different terminology. R-R Interval is specific to ECG. Inter-Beat Interval (IBI) or Pulse-to-Pulse Interval (PPI) are more appropriate for PPG, with IBI being the most common.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe value representing the time between consecutive heartbeats, captured via PPG and used to compute HRV, is called the Inter-Beat Interval.\n\n<<<Inter-Beat Interval (IBI)>>>"
