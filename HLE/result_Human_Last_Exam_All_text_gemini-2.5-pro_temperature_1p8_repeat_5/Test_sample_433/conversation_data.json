    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe user is asking for the Beyond-Use Date (BUD) for a specific type of medication container under specific conditions.\n*   **Item:** A single-dose container, specifically an **ampule**.\n*   **Action:** It has been punctured or opened. \"Puncture\" is used, but for an ampule, the correct action is \"breaking\" it open.\n*   **Environment:** The action occurs in a **sterile environment**, which according to pharmacy standards (USP <797>), refers to an ISO Class 5 Primary Engineering Control (PEC), like a laminar airflow workbench.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Governing Standard**\nThe primary reference for sterile compounding and assigning BUDs in the United States is the **United States Pharmacopeia (USP) General Chapter <797>**. This chapter outlines the minimum standards for protecting patients from harm due to microbial contamination, excessive bacterial endotoxins, and incorrect strength of ingredients.\n\n**Step 3: Locate the Specific Rule within USP <797>**\nUSP <797> has a dedicated section on the use of single-dose containers. It is crucial to note that within this category, USP <797> makes a clear and important distinction between ampules and other single-dose containers (like vials).\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Rule for Ampules**\n*   An ampule is a hermetically sealed glass container. To open it, the neck of the ampule must be broken.\n*   Once an ampule is broken, it **cannot be resealed**. This leaves the contents directly exposed to the surrounding environment.\n*   Because it cannot be resealed to protect against microbial ingress, USP <797> has a very strict rule for opened ampules. The standard explicitly states: **\"Opened ampules must not be stored for any period of time.\"**\n*   This means the contents must be withdrawn immediately after opening. Furthermore, the contents must be filtered through a sterile filter (typically a 5-micron filter needle or straw) to remove any potential glass shards that may have fallen into the solution when the ampule was broken.\n*   Any unused portion of the medication in the ampule must be discarded immediately. It cannot be saved for later use.\n\n**Step 5: Differentiate from Other Single-Dose Containers (e.g., Vials)**\nThis is a critical point of care and a common source of error. The rules for a single-dose *vial* are different.\n*   A single-dose vial has a rubber stopper that can be punctured by a needle and which reseals (to an extent) after the needle is withdrawn.\n*   According to the current USP <797> (2023 version), if a single-dose vial is punctured within an ISO Class 5 or better environment, its contents can be used for up to **12 hours** after the initial puncture, provided the vial remains within that sterile environment.\n*   The question specifically mentions an **ampule**, so this 12-hour rule does not apply.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Container Type:** The question is not about all single-dose containers; it is specifically about an **ampule**. This is the most important detail.\n2.  **Inability to Reseal:** The core reason for the strict rule is that an ampule, once broken, is an open container that cannot be closed again to maintain sterility.\n3.  **No Storage Period:** The rule is absolute. There is no permitted storage time for an opened ampule, regardless of the sterility of the environment. \"Immediate use\" is the only option.\n4.  **Filtering Requirement:** Always remember that contents drawn from a glass ampule must be filtered to remove potential glass particles.\n5.  **Distinction from Vials:** Do not confuse the rule for ampules with the 12-hour rule for single-dose vials opened in an ISO Class 5 environment.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nBased on the explicit guidance in USP <797>, the BUD for a single-dose container ampule from the time of opening is for immediate use only. It cannot be stored for any length of time.\n\n<<<Immediate use only. The ampule must not be stored for any period of time after opening."
