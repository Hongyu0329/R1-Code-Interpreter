Let the base formula be the multiplicative constant $\bot$.

The function $f$ maps a natural number $w$ to the formula representing $w$ "units" of resource, constructed using the tensor product:
$$ f(w) = \bot^{\otimes w} = \underbrace{\bot \otimes \bot \otimes \dots \otimes \bot}_{w \text{ times}} $$
By convention, for $w=0$, $f(0) = \mathbf{1}$, the multiplicative unit.

The linear logic formula $C$ represents the goal of creating $m$ distinct objects, where each object is constructed from exactly $b$ units of resource. The distinction between the objects is enforced by the top-level tensor products.
$$ C = (\bot^{\otimes b})^{\otimes m} = \underbrace{(\bot^{\otimes b}) \otimes (\bot^{\otimes b}) \otimes \dots \otimes (\bot^{\otimes b})}_{m \text{ times}} $$
The sequent $\{ f(w) \mid w \in W \} \vdash C$ is thus:
$$ \{ \bot^{\otimes w} \mid w \in W \} \vdash (\bot^{\otimes b})^{\otimes m} $$
This sequent is provable in linear logic if and only if the Equipartitioning Problem $EP(W, m, b)$ is true.
