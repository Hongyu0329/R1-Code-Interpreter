    "### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Core Question:** The goal is to determine the total number of \"members\" of the let-7 microRNA (miRNA) family currently known in humans.\n\n2.  **Define \"let-7 Family\" and \"Member\":**\n    *   **let-7 Family:** A group of evolutionarily conserved miRNAs that share a similar \"seed sequence\" (a short sequence of nucleotides 2-8 from the 5' end of the miRNA). This shared seed sequence means they generally target and regulate a similar set of messenger RNA (mRNA) transcripts.\n    *   **Member:** This term can be ambiguous. It could mean:\n        a.  **Unique Mature miRNA Sequences:** These are the final, functional ~22-nucleotide molecules. For example, `let-7a` and `let-7b` are different mature sequences.\n        b.  **Precursor Genes (pre-miRNAs):** These are the genes in the DNA that code for the miRNAs. A single mature sequence can be encoded by multiple genes located at different positions in the genome. For example, the mature `let-7a` sequence is produced from three different genes: `mir-let-7a-1`, `mir-let-7a-2`, and `mir-let-7a-3`.\n    *   **Careful Point:** To provide the most comprehensive answer, it's best to consider the number of precursor genes, as this reflects the total genetic contribution to the family. This interpretation is common in genomic and molecular biology literature.\n\n3.  **Consult Authoritative Sources:** The primary database for miRNA information is **miRBase**. We will also consider information from established scientific reviews on the topic.\n\n4.  **List and Count the Members (Precursor Genes):**\n    We need to list all the unique precursor genes in humans (*Homo sapiens*, abbreviated as `hsa`) that belong to the let-7 family. According to miRBase (Release 22.1) and supporting literature:\n\n    *   **let-7a:** is encoded by 3 distinct genes.\n        1.  `hsa-mir-let-7a-1`\n        2.  `hsa-mir-let-7a-2`\n        3.  `hsa-mir-let-7a-3`\n    *   **let-7f:** is encoded by 2 distinct genes.\n        4.  `hsa-mir-let-7f-1`\n        5.  `hsa-mir-let-7f-2`\n    *   **let-7b, c, d, e, g, i:** are each encoded by a single gene.\n        6.  `hsa-mir-let-7b`\n        7.  `hsa-mir-let-7c`\n        8.  `hsa-mir-let-7d`\n        9.  `hsa-mir-let-7e`\n        10. `hsa-mir-let-7g`\n        11. `hsa-mir-let-7i`\n    *   **Other Related miRNAs:** Due to high sequence similarity in the seed region, two other miRNAs are officially considered part of the human let-7 family.\n        12. `hsa-mir-98` (encoded by one gene)\n        13. `hsa-mir-202` (encoded by one gene)\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Total:**\n    Summing up all the identified precursor genes:\n    3 (for let-7a) + 2 (for let-7f) + 6 (for let-7b, c, d, e, g, i) + 1 (for miR-98) + 1 (for miR-202) = **13**\n\n### Final Answer\nBased on the number of unique precursor genes identified in the human genome, there are 13 members of the let-7 family. These 13 genes produce 10 distinct mature miRNA sequences.\n\n<<<13>>>"
