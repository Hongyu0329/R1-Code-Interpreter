    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Question\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the question:** The goal is to find the maximum possible number of different clique sizes that can exist as induced subgraphs in a single graph `G` with `n = 128` vertices.\n\n2.  **Define the key terms:**\n    *   **Graph `G` on `n=128` vertices:** A graph with a set of 128 vertices and some set of edges between them.\n    *   **Clique:** A subset of vertices in which every two distinct vertices are adjacent (connected by an edge). A clique with `k` vertices is denoted as `K_k`.\n    *   **Induced Subgraph:** For a subset of vertices `S` from `G`, the induced subgraph `G[S]` is the graph whose vertex set is `S` and whose edge set consists of *all* the edges in `G` that have both endpoints in `S`.\n    *   **A clique size `k` appears as an induced subgraph:** This means there exists a subset of `k` vertices, let's call it `S_k`, such that the subgraph induced by `S_k` is a complete graph, i.e., `G[S_k] = K_k`. This is the standard definition of a clique of size `k`.\n    *   **Number of different clique sizes:** We are looking for the size of the set `C(G) = {k | G` has an induced subgraph isomorphic to `K_k`}`.\n    *   **Maximum possible number:** We need to find the maximum value of `|C(G)|` over all possible graphs `G` on 128 vertices.\n\n3.  **Relate the concepts:** Let `k_max` be the size of the largest clique in the graph `G`. This is also known as the clique number of `G`, denoted `ω(G)`. This means there exists a set of `k_max` vertices, `V_{max}`, that form a clique.\n\n4.  **Analyze the set of clique sizes `C(G)`:** If a graph `G` contains a clique `V_{max}` of size `k_max`, then for any integer `k` between 1 and `k_max` (i.e., `1 <= k <= k_max`), we can simply choose any `k` vertices from the set `V_{max}`. Let this new subset be `V_k`. Since all vertices in `V_{max}` are pairwise connected, all vertices in its subset `V_k` must also be pairwise connected. Therefore, the subgraph induced by `V_k`, which is `G[V_k]`, is a complete graph `K_k`.\n\n5.  **Conclusion about the structure of `C(G)`:** From the previous step, we see that if a graph has a maximum clique of size `k_max`, it must also have cliques of all sizes `1, 2, ..., k_max - 1`. The set `C(G)` of all possible clique sizes is therefore the set of integers `{1, 2, ..., k_max}`. The number of different clique sizes is simply `|C(G)| = k_max = ω(G)`.\n\n6.  **Reframe the Problem:** The original question is now simplified to: \"What is the maximum possible clique number, `ω(G)`, for a graph `G` on `n=128` vertices?\"\n\n7.  **Solve the simplified problem:**\n    *   For any graph `G` on `n` vertices, the size of any clique cannot exceed the total number of vertices. So, `ω(G) <= n`. For `n=128`, this means the maximum possible clique number is at most 128.\n    *   We must show that this upper bound is achievable. Consider the complete graph on 128 vertices, `K_{128}`. This graph has 128 vertices. The set of all 128 vertices forms a clique of size 128. Thus, for `G = K_{128}`, `ω(G) = 128`.\n\n8.  **Final Answer Derivation:** Since the maximum possible number of different clique sizes in a graph `G` is equal to its clique number `ω(G)`, and the maximum possible value for `ω(G)` for a graph on 128 vertices is 128, the answer is 128.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Clique vs. Induced Subgraph `K_k`:** The definition of a clique (a set of pairwise adjacent vertices) is precisely the condition for a set of vertices to induce a complete graph. The terms describe the same structure.\n*   **\"All\" Cliques vs. \"Maximal\" Cliques:** The question refers to \"clique sizes\" without the qualifier \"maximal\". A maximal clique is one that cannot be extended by adding another vertex. If the question intended to ask for the number of different sizes of *maximal* cliques, it would have used more specific language. The literal interpretation, considering all possible clique sizes, is the most direct reading of the question. As shown in the analysis, this leads to the answer 128. (For completeness, interpreting it as \"maximal clique sizes\" would lead to the answer 15).\n*   **The \"Downward Hereditary\" Property:** The most crucial logical step is recognizing that if a clique of size `k` exists, cliques of all smaller sizes must also exist. This simplifies the problem from finding the size of a potentially sparse set of numbers to just finding the maximum number in that set.\n*   **Achievability:** It's not enough to state that the number of sizes can't be more than 128. A specific graph, the complete graph `K_{128}`, must be presented as an example that achieves this maximum.\n\n### Final Answer Acquisition\n\nBased on the detailed step-by-step analysis, we have established the following:\n1.  The number of different clique sizes that appear as induced subgraphs in a graph `G` is equal to the size of the largest clique in `G`, i.e., its clique number `ω(G)`.\n2.  The problem is therefore equivalent to finding the maximum possible clique number for a graph on `n=128` vertices.\n3.  The maximum clique number for a graph on `n` vertices is `n`.\n4.  This maximum is achieved by the complete graph `K_n`.\n5.  For `n=128`, the maximum number of different clique sizes is 128.\n\n<<<128>>>"
