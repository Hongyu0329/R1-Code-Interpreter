    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Task:** The goal is to synthesize a 100-amino-acid (100aa) peptide containing an unnatural amino acid (nAA), specifically azido phenylalanine (a type of nAA often used in \"click chemistry\").\n\n2.  **Evaluate the Length (100aa):** A 100-residue peptide is considered quite large.\n    *   **Direct Chemical Synthesis (SPPS):** Standard Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS) involves adding amino acids one by one. While powerful, the overall yield decreases exponentially with each step. For a 100aa peptide, even with a high efficiency of 99% per step, the theoretical maximum yield would be very low ((0.99)^99 â‰ˆ 37%), and in practice, it is much lower. Purifying the full-length product from the many shorter, failed sequences (deletion mutants) would be extremely difficult. Therefore, SPPS alone is not an ideal method for a peptide of this length.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Unnatural Amino Acid (nAA) Incorporation:** The peptide needs to include azido phenylalanine.\n    *   **Standard Recombinant Expression:** Biological synthesis using an organism like *E. coli* is excellent for producing long proteins. However, the cell's natural machinery can only incorporate the 20 standard proteinogenic amino acids. It cannot directly read a codon and insert azido phenylalanine. Therefore, standard recombinant protein expression is not a suitable method on its own.\n\n4.  **Consider Advanced and Hybrid Techniques:** We need a method that can handle both the length and the nAA. This points towards more advanced or hybrid strategies.\n\n    *   **Genetic Code Expansion (e.g., Amber Suppression):** This is a powerful *in vivo* technique. It modifies the machinery of a host organism (like *E. coli*). An orthogonal tRNA/aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase pair is introduced. The synthetase is engineered to specifically charge its tRNA partner with the nAA (azido phenylalanine), which is supplied in the growth medium. This tRNA is engineered to recognize a stop codon (typically the UAG \"amber\" codon) that has been placed in the gene at the desired position for the nAA. When the ribosome encounters this codon, it incorporates the nAA instead of terminating synthesis.\n        *   **Pros:** Can produce the full-length, modified protein in a single biological process.\n        *   **Cons:** The efficiency of nAA incorporation can be less than 100%, leading to a mixture of the full-length desired peptide and a truncated version that stops at the amber codon. This can complicate purification.\n\n    *   **Native Chemical Ligation (NCL):** This is a powerful *in vitro* semi-synthetic technique. It is designed to ligate (join) two or more smaller peptide fragments to create a larger protein. The key reaction occurs between a peptide fragment with a C-terminal thioester and another fragment with an N-terminal cysteine. This reaction forms a native peptide bond at the ligation site.\n        *   **How it applies here:** The 100aa peptide can be broken down into two or more manageable fragments. For example, a 50aa N-terminal fragment and a 50aa C-terminal fragment. The fragment containing the azido phenylalanine ('X') can be synthesized using SPPS. Since this fragment is much shorter than 100aa, SPPS is now feasible and can produce the fragment in high purity. The other fragment(s) can be made by either SPPS or, more efficiently, by recombinant expression (if it contains no nAAs). Finally, the purified fragments are joined together *in vitro* using NCL.\n        *   **Pros:** Very robust and modular. It allows the most difficult part (nAA incorporation) to be handled in a controlled chemical synthesis on a small scale, and the bulk of the peptide can be made efficiently via recombinant methods. It typically leads to a very pure final product because the fragments are purified before ligation. The sequence given (`...[KAVCLXVIGATR...`) contains a cysteine residue, which is the exact requirement for an NCL ligation site, making this technique particularly well-suited for this specific problem.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nComparing the options, Native Chemical Ligation (NCL) is the most helpful technique for this specific problem. It elegantly overcomes both challenges: the peptide length (by breaking it into smaller pieces) and the nAA incorporation (by allowing the use of SPPS for the specific fragment that needs it). The presence of a cysteine in the provided sequence further reinforces the suitability of NCL. While Genetic Code Expansion is a viable alternative, NCL often provides better control and higher purity for the final product in a research or production setting.\n\n<<<Native Chemical Ligation (NCL)>>>"
