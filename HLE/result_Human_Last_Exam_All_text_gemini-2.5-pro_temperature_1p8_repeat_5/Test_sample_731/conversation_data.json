    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of power subgroups in the semidihedral group of size 512.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Definitions**\n\n*   **Semidihedral Group (`SD_{2^k}`):** For `k >= 3`, the semidihedral group of order `2^k` is denoted by `SD_{2^k}`. Its presentation is:\n    `SD_{2^k} = <r, s | r^(2^(k-1)) = 1, s^2 = 1, srs = r^(2^(k-2) - 1)>`\n    The order of the group is `|SD_{2^k}| = 2^k`.\n*   **Power Subgroup:** A subgroup `H` of a group `G` is called a power subgroup if there exists an integer `m` such that `H` is equal to the set `G^m = {g^m | g in G}`. The question asks for the number of distinct such subgroups.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Specific Group**\n\nThe question specifies the semidihedral group of size 512.\n*   Size = `2^k = 512 = 2^9`.\n*   Therefore, `k = 9`.\n*   The group is `G = SD_{512}`, with the presentation:\n    `G = <r, s | r^(2^(9-1)) = 1, s^2 = 1, srs = r^(2^(9-2) - 1)>`\n    `G = <r, s | r^256 = 1, s^2 = 1, srs = r^(128 - 1) = r^127>`\n*   The elements of `G` are of two forms: `r^i` for `0 <= i < 256` and `sr^i` for `0 <= i < 256`.\n\n**Step 3: Simplify the Problem**\n\nWe need to find the number of distinct subgroups in the set `{G^m | m \\in Z}`.\n*   `G` is a 2-group (its order is a power of 2).\n*   For any `p`-group, the map `φ(g) = g^k` is a permutation of the group if `gcd(k, p) = 1`. In our case, `p=2`, so `φ(g) = g^k` is a permutation for any odd integer `k`.\n*   Any integer `m` can be written as `m = t * 2^a`, where `t` is an odd integer and `a >= 0`.\n*   The set `G^m = G^(t*2^a)` is `{g^(t*2^a) | g in G} = {(g^t)^(2^a) | g in G}`.\n*   Since the map `g -> g^t` is a permutation on `G`, the set `{g^t | g in G}` is the same as the set `G`.\n*   Therefore, `G^m = {h^(2^a) | h in G} = G^(2^a)`.\nThis simplifies the problem immensely. We only need to find the distinct subgroups among the sets `G^(2^a)` for `a >= 0`.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the sets `G^(2^a)`**\n\nWe need to calculate `G^(2^a) = {g^(2^a) | g in G}` for `a = 0, 1, 2, ...`\nLet's analyze the powers of the elements in `G`.\n1.  Elements of the form `r^i`: `(r^i)^(2^a) = r^(i * 2^a)`. As `i` ranges from `0` to `255`, the set `{r^(i * 2^a)}` forms the cyclic subgroup `<r^(gcd(2^a, 256))> = <r^(2^a)>` (for `a <= 8`). For `a > 8`, it's `{e}`.\n2.  Elements of the form `sr^i`: We first compute `(sr^i)^2`.\n    `(sr^i)^2 = sr^i * sr^i = s(r^i s)r^i`.\n    Using the relation `srs = r^127`, we can deduce `sr^i s = (srs)^i = (r^127)^i`.\n    So, `(sr^i)^2 = (r^127)^i * r^i = r^(127i + i) = r^(128i)`.\n    From this:\n    *   If `i` is even, `128i` is a multiple of 256, so `(sr^i)^2 = r^(128i) = e`. The order of `sr^i` is 2.\n    *   If `i` is odd, `128i = 128 * (2j+1) = 256j + 128`, so `r^(128i) = r^128`. Then `(sr^i)^2 = r^128`. The order of `sr^i` is 4, since `(r^128)^2 = r^256 = e`.\n\nNow we can compute `G^(2^a)`:\n\n*   **Case a = 0 (`m = 1`):**\n    `G^1 = G`. This is a subgroup by definition.\n\n*   **Case a = 1 (`m = 2`):**\n    `G^2 = {g^2 | g in G} = { (r^i)^2 } U { (sr^i)^2 }`\n    *   `{ (r^i)^2 } = <r^2>`\n    *   `{ (sr^i)^2 } = { r^(128i) }`. When `i` is even, this is `e`. When `i` is odd, this is `r^128`. So, the set is `{e, r^128} = <r^128>`.\n    `G^2 = <r^2> U <r^128>`. Since `r^128 = (r^2)^64`, the subgroup `<r^128>` is contained in `<r^2>`.\n    Thus, `G^2 = <r^2>`. This is a cyclic group and therefore a subgroup.\n\n*   **Case a >= 2 (`m = 4, 8, 16, ...`):**\n    `G^(2^a) = {g^(2^a) | g in G} = { (r^i)^(2^a) } U { (sr^i)^(2^a) }`\n    *   `{ (r^i)^(2^a) } = <r^(2^a)>`\n    *   For elements `sr^i`, their order is either 2 or 4. Since `a >= 2`, `2^a` is a multiple of 4. Therefore, for any `g = sr^i`, `g^(2^a)` will be the identity element `e`. So, `{ (sr^i)^(2^a) } = {e}`.\n    `G^(2^a) = <r^(2^a)> U {e}`. Since `e` is in `<r^(2^a)>`, we have:\n    `G^(2^a) = <r^(2^a)>`. These are cyclic groups and thus are subgroups.\n\n**Step 5: Enumerate and Count the Distinct Power Subgroups**\n\nThe set of all power subgroups is the set of distinct subgroups among `{ G^(2^a) | a >= 0 }`. Let's list them:\n\n1.  `a = 0`: `G^1 = G = SD_{512}` (Order 512, non-cyclic)\n2.  `a = 1`: `G^2 = <r^2>` (Order `256/2 = 128`)\n3.  `a = 2`: `G^4 = <r^4>` (Order `256/4 = 64`)\n4.  `a = 3`: `G^8 = <r^8>` (Order `256/8 = 32`)\n5.  `a = 4`: `G^16 = <r^16>` (Order `256/16 = 16`)\n6.  `a = 5`: `G^32 = <r^32>` (Order `256/32 = 8`)\n7.  `a = 6`: `G^64 = <r^64>` (Order `256/64 = 4`)\n8.  `a = 7`: `G^128 = <r^128>` (Order `256/128 = 2`)\n9.  `a = 8`: `G^256 = <r^256> = {e}` (The trivial subgroup of order 1)\n\nFor `a > 8`, `G^(2^a)` will also be the trivial subgroup `{e}`. For example, `G^512 = G^(2^9) = <r^512> = <(r^256)^2> = <e^2> = {e}`.\n\nThese 9 subgroups are all distinct. `G` is non-cyclic, while all others are cyclic. The cyclic subgroups `<r^(2^a)>` for `a = 1, ..., 8` all have different orders, so they are distinct from each other and from `G`.\n\nCounting them, we have a total of 9 distinct power subgroups."
