    "Answering this question requires understanding the structure of Dirichlet characters, particularly how to count primitive characters of a specific order and conductor.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the problem structure:**\n\n*   We are looking for the number of **primitive** Dirichlet characters $\\chi$.\n*   The **conductor** is $N = 36036$.\n*   The **order** of the characters must be $6$.\n\nA fundamental theorem in character theory states that any Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $N$ can be uniquely factored into a product of characters associated with the prime power factors of $N$.\nIf $N = p_1^{a_1} p_2^{a_2} \\cdots p_r^{a_r}$, then $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\cdots \\chi_r$, where $\\chi_i$ is a character modulo $p_i^{a_i}$.\n\nThe character $\\chi$ is **primitive** modulo $N$ if and only if each component character $\\chi_i$ is primitive modulo its respective prime power $p_i^{a_i}$.\n\nThe **order** of $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its components: $\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_1), \\text{ord}(\\chi_2), \\ldots, \\text{ord}(\\chi_r))$.\n\n**2. Factorize the conductor N:**\n\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of the conductor $N$.\n$N = 36036 = 36 \\times 1001 = (4 \\times 9) \\times (7 \\times 11 \\times 13)$.\nSo, the prime factorization is $N = 2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7^1 \\cdot 11^1 \\cdot 13^1$.\n\nWe need to find the number of tuples of primitive characters $(\\chi_{4}, \\chi_{9}, \\chi_{7}, \\chi_{11}, \\chi_{13})$ such that $\\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_{4}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{9}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{7}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{11}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{13})) = 6$.\n\n**3. Analyze primitive characters for each prime power factor:**\n\nWe need to find the number of primitive characters for each factor $p^a$ and their possible orders.\nLet's denote $n(k, \\text{ord})$ as the number of primitive characters of conductor $k$ and order `ord`. The number of elements of order $d$ in a cyclic group of order $m$ (where $d|m$) is $\\phi(d)$.\n\n*   **Conductor $4 = 2^2$**: The group of characters modulo 4 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_2$. There are $\\phi(4)=2$ characters. One is the trivial character (conductor 1, order 1). The other is non-trivial and must be primitive of conductor 4. Its order is 2.\n    *   $n(4, 2) = 1$. The only possible order is 2.\n\n*   **Conductor $9 = 3^2$**: The group of characters mod 9 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/9\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_6$. The orders of these characters are the divisors of 6. The non-primitive characters mod 9 are those induced from mod 3. The character group mod 3 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_2$, which has one character of order 1 and one of order 2.\n    *   Total characters mod 9: $1$ of order 1, $1$ of order 2, $2$ of order 3, $2$ of order 6.\n    *   Non-primitive characters mod 9: $1$ of order 1, $1$ of order 2.\n    *   Primitive characters mod 9 are found by subtraction: $2$ of order 3 and $2$ of order 6.\n    *   $n(9, 3) = 2$, $n(9, 6) = 2$.\n\n*   **Conductor $7$**: The group of characters mod 7 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_6$. For a prime conductor $p$, the primitive characters are all the non-trivial ones. The possible orders are the divisors of $\\phi(7)=6$, except 1.\n    *   $n(7, 2) = \\phi(2) = 1$.\n    *   $n(7, 3) = \\phi(3) = 2$.\n    *   $n(7, 6) = \\phi(6) = 2$.\n\n*   **Conductor $11$**: The group of characters mod 11 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/11\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_{10}$. We need characters whose order is a divisor of 6. The divisors of 10 are 1, 2, 5, 10. The only non-trivial order that is also a divisor of 6 is 2.\n    *   $n(11, 2) = \\phi(2) = 1$.\n\n*   **Conductor $13$**: The group of characters mod 13 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/13\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_{12}$. We need characters whose order is a divisor of 6. The divisors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12. The non-trivial orders that are also divisors of 6 are 2, 3, and 6.\n    *   $n(13, 2) = \\phi(2) = 1$.\n    *   $n(13, 3) = \\phi(3) = 2$.\n    *   $n(13, 6) = \\phi(6) = 2$.\n\n**4. Combine the results:**\n\nLet the orders of the component characters be $(o_4, o_9, o_7, o_{11}, o_{13})$. We need $\\text{lcm}(o_4, o_9, o_7, o_{11}, o_{13}) = 6$. Let's analyze the constraints on the lcm:\n1.  All possible orders we found for the components ($2, 3, 6$) are divisors of 6. Therefore, the lcm of any combination of these orders must also be a divisor of 6.\n2.  For the lcm to be 6, it must be divisible by 2 and 3.\n    *   The order of $\\chi_4$ must be $o_4=2$. This guarantees the lcm is divisible by 2.\n    *   The order of $\\chi_9$ must be $o_9 \\in \\{3, 6\\}$. This guarantees the lcm is divisible by 3.\n3.  Since any valid combination of primitive characters will have an lcm that is divisible by 6 and also divides 6, the lcm must be exactly 6.\n\nTherefore, we simply need to count the total number of valid combinations of primitive characters, as every single one will result in a character of order 6.\n\nThe number of choices for each component character is:\n*   Choices for $\\chi_4$: The only possible order is 2. Number of characters = $n(4, 2) = 1$.\n*   Choices for $\\chi_9$: Orders can be 3 or 6. Number of characters = $n(9, 3) + n(9, 6) = 2 + 2 = 4$.\n*   Choices for $\\chi_7$: Orders can be 2, 3, or 6. Number of characters = $n(7, 2) + n(7, 3) + n(7, 6) = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5$.\n*   Choices for $\\chi_{11}$: The only possible order is 2. Number of characters = $n(11, 2) = 1$.\n*   Choices for $\\chi_{13}$: Orders can be 2, 3, or 6. Number of characters = $n(13, 2) + n(13, 3) + n(13, 6) = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5$.\n\nThe total number of primitive characters of conductor $N=36036$ and order 6 is the product of the number of choices for each component:\nTotal Number = (choices for $\\chi_4$) $\\times$ (choices for $\\chi_9$) $\\times$ (choices for $\\chi_7$) $\\times$ (choices for $\\chi_{11}$) $\\times$ (choices for $\\chi_{13}$)\nTotal Number = $1 \\times 4 \\times 5 \\times 1 \\times 5 = 100$."
