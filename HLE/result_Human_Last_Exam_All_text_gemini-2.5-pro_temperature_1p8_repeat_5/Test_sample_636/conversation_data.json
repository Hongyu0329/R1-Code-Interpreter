    "**Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\nThe problem is to find a state feedback gain matrix `F` for a linear system such that the closed-loop system `A + BF` has a specific set of eigenvalues.\n\n**1. Define the System and Goal**\n\n*   State matrix: `A = [[-1, 1], [1, 0]]`\n*   Input matrix: `B = [[1, 2], [1, 0]]`\n*   The state feedback gain matrix `F` is unknown. Since the state vector `x` is 2x1 and the input vector `u` is 2x1, `F` must be a 2x2 matrix. Let `F = [[f1, f2], [f3, f4]]`.\n*   The closed-loop system matrix is given by `A_cl = A + BF`.\n*   The desired eigenvalues of `A_cl` are `-1 + j` and `-1 - j`.\n\n**2. Determine the Desired Characteristic Polynomial**\n\nA matrix's eigenvalues are the roots of its characteristic polynomial. For a pair of complex conjugate eigenvalues `p1 = a + jb` and `p2 = a - jb`, the characteristic polynomial is:\n`P_des(s) = (s - p1)(s - p2) = (s - (a + jb))(s - (a - jb))`\n`P_des(s) = ((s - a) - jb)((s - a) + jb) = (s - a)^2 - (jb)^2 = s^2 - 2as + a^2 + b^2`\n\nFor the desired eigenvalues `-1 Â± j`, we have `a = -1` and `b = 1`.\n`P_des(s) = s^2 - 2(-1)s + (-1)^2 + 1^2`\n`P_des(s) = s^2 + 2s + 1 + 1`\n`P_des(s) = s^2 + 2s + 2`\n\n**3. Determine the Actual Characteristic Polynomial**\n\nFirst, we compute the closed-loop matrix `A_cl = A + BF` in terms of the unknown elements of `F`.\n\n*   Calculate `BF`:\n    `BF = [[1, 2], [1, 0]] * [[f1, f2], [f3, f4]] = [[1*f1 + 2*f3, 1*f2 + 2*f4], [1*f1 + 0*f3, 1*f2 + 0*f4]] = [[f1 + 2*f3, f2 + 2*f4], [f1, f2]]`\n\n*   Calculate `A_cl = A + BF`:\n    `A_cl = [[-1, 1], [1, 0]] + [[f1 + 2*f3, f2 + 2*f4], [f1, f2]] = [[-1 + f1 + 2*f3, 1 + f2 + 2*f4], [1 + f1, f2]]`\n\nNow, find the characteristic polynomial of `A_cl`, which is `P_actual(s) = det(sI - A_cl)`. For a 2x2 matrix, this is `s^2 - tr(A_cl)s + det(A_cl)`.\n\n*   Calculate the trace of `A_cl`:\n    `tr(A_cl) = (-1 + f1 + 2*f3) + f2 = -1 + f1 + f2 + 2*f3`\n\n*   Calculate the determinant of `A_cl`:\n    `det(A_cl) = (-1 + f1 + 2*f3)(f2) - (1 + f2 + 2*f4)(1 + f1)`\n    `det(A_cl) = -f2 + f1*f2 + 2*f2*f3 - (1 + f1 + f2 + f1*f2 + 2*f4 + 2*f1*f4)`\n    `det(A_cl) = -1 - f1 - 2*f2 + 2*f2*f3 - 2*f4 - 2*f1*f4`\n\n*   The actual characteristic polynomial is:\n    `P_actual(s) = s^2 - (-1 + f1 + f2 + 2*f3)s + (-1 - f1 - 2*f2 + 2*f2*f3 - 2*f4 - 2*f1*f4)`\n    `P_actual(s) = s^2 + (1 - f1 - f2 - 2*f3)s + (-1 - f1 - 2*f2 + 2*f2*f3 - 2*f4 - 2*f1*f4)`\n\n**4. Equate Coefficients and Solve for F**\n\nWe equate the coefficients of `P_actual(s)` and `P_des(s)`:\n`P_actual(s) = P_des(s)`\n`s^2 + (1 - f1 - f2 - 2*f3)s + (...) = s^2 + 2s + 2`\n\nThis gives us a system of two equations:\n\n1.  (Coefficient of `s`) `1 - f1 - f2 - 2*f3 = 2  =>  -f1 - f2 - 2*f3 = 1`\n2.  (Constant term) `-1 - f1 - 2*f2 + 2*f2*f3 - 2*f4 - 2*f1*f4 = 2  =>  -f1 - 2*f2 + 2*f2*f3 - 2*f4 - 2*f1*f4 = 3`\n\nWe have two equations and four unknowns (`f1, f2, f3, f4`), which means there are infinite solutions. We can find one specific solution by making a simplifying choice. A common method is to set some elements of `F` to zero.\n\nLet's assume `f3 = 0` and `f4 = 0`. This is equivalent to only using the first control input and setting the second to zero. The system of equations simplifies to:\n\n1.  `-f1 - f2 - 2(0) = 1  =>  -f1 - f2 = 1`\n2.  `-f1 - 2*f2 + 2*f2(0) - 2(0) - 2*f1(0) = 3  =>  -f1 - 2*f2 = 3`\n\nNow we have a system of two linear equations with two unknowns:\n1.  `-f1 - f2 = 1`\n2.  `-f1 - 2*f2 = 3`\n\nSubtract the first equation from the second:\n`(-f1 - 2*f2) - (-f1 - f2) = 3 - 1`\n`-f2 = 2  =>  f2 = -2`\n\nSubstitute `f2 = -2` back into the first equation:\n`-f1 - (-2) = 1`\n`-f1 + 2 = 1`\n`-f1 = -1  =>  f1 = 1`\n\nSo, we have found one possible solution: `f1 = 1`, `f2 = -2`, `f3 = 0`, `f4 = 0`.\n\n**5. Final Answer**\n\nThe state feedback gain matrix `F` is:\n`F = [[1, -2], [0, 0]]`\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   **Notation:** The problem uses `A + BF` for the closed-loop matrix. Standard control textbooks often use `A - BF`. It's crucial to stick to the notation given in the problem statement.\n*   **Controllability:** The existence of a solution for `F` is guaranteed because the pair `(A, B)` is controllable. The rank of the controllability matrix `C = [B AB]` is 2, which is the dimension of the state space.\n*   **Non-uniqueness:** For multi-input systems, the state feedback gain `F` that achieves a desired set of eigenvalues is generally not unique. We found one of infinitely many possible solutions. Any other valid choice (e.g., setting `f1=0, f2=0`) would also lead to a correct, though different, `F` matrix.\n\n<<<[[1, -2], [0, 0]]>>>"
