    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of power subgroups in the generalized quaternion group of size 128.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the group and the question.**\n\n*   **The Group:** The group is the generalized quaternion group of size 128, which is denoted as $Q_{128}$. Its order is $|Q_{128}| = 128 = 2^7$. For the generalized quaternion group of order $2^n$, $Q_{2^n}$ (where $n \\ge 3$), the presentation is given by:\n    $Q_{2^n} = \\langle x, y \\mid x^{2^{n-1}} = 1, y^2 = x^{2^{n-2}}, y^{-1}xy = x^{-1} \\rangle$.\n    For $Q_{128}$, we have $n=7$. So the presentation is:\n    $Q_{128} = \\langle x, y \\mid x^{64} = 1, y^2 = x^{32}, y^{-1}xy = x^{-1} \\rangle$.\n\n*   **The Question:** The question asks for the number of \"power subgroups\". A power subgroup is a subgroup that can be generated by a single element. In other words, a power subgroup is a **cyclic subgroup**. The question is equivalent to asking: \"How many distinct cyclic subgroups are there in $Q_{128}$?\".\n\n**Careful Point 1:** Ensure the correct presentation for the group of the specified size is used. For order 128 ($=2^7$), we have $n=7$, so the power of $x$ is $2^{7-1}=64$ and the relation for $y^2$ is $x^{2^{7-2}}=x^{32}$.\n\n**Step 2: Classify the elements of the group.**\n\nThe elements of $Q_{128}$ can be uniquely written in the form $x^k$ or $yx^k$.\n*   The subgroup $\\langle x \\rangle = \\{x^k \\mid 0 \\le k < 64\\}$ has 64 elements.\n*   The coset $y\\langle x \\rangle = \\{yx^k \\mid 0 \\le k < 64\\}$ has 64 elements.\nWe can find all cyclic subgroups by considering the subgroups generated by elements from each of these two sets.\n\n**Step 3: Count the cyclic subgroups generated by elements of the form $x^k$.**\n\nThese are the subgroups of the cyclic group $\\langle x \\rangle$.\n*   The order of $\\langle x \\rangle$ is 64.\n*   A fundamental theorem of cyclic groups states that a cyclic group of order $m$ has exactly one subgroup for each divisor of $m$. The number of subgroups is $\\tau(m)$, the number of positive divisors of $m$.\n*   For $m=64=2^6$, the divisors are $1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64$.\n*   The number of divisors is $\\tau(64) = 6+1=7$.\nSo, there are **7** distinct cyclic subgroups contained within $\\langle x \\rangle$.\n\n**Careful Point 2:** Remember the formula for the number of subgroups of a cyclic group. This part is straightforward but foundational. These 7 subgroups are $\\langle x^{64/d} \\rangle$ where d is a divisor of 64.\n\n**Step 4: Count the cyclic subgroups generated by elements of the form $yx^k$.**\n\nFirst, we need to find the order of an element $g = yx^k$.\n*   We use the group relations: $yx^k = x^{-k}y$. This is derived from the given relation $y^{-1}xy=x^{-1}$.\n*   Let's compute $g^2$:\n    $g^2 = (yx^k)^2 = (yx^k)(yx^k) = y(x^ky)x^k = y(yx^{-k})x^k = y^2 x^{-k}x^k = y^2$.\n*   From the group presentation, we know $y^2 = x^{32}$. So, $g^2 = x^{32}$.\n*   The order of $x^{32}$ is 2, since $(x^{32})^2 = x^{64} = 1$.\n*   Since $g^2 = x^{32} \\ne 1$ and $g^4 = (g^2)^2 = (x^{32})^2 = 1$, the order of any element $g=yx^k$ is **4**.\n\nNow, we count the number of distinct subgroups generated by these elements.\n*   All 64 elements of the form $yx^k$ have order 4.\n*   Each of these elements generates a cyclic subgroup of order 4.\n*   A cyclic group of order 4 has $\\phi(4) = 2$ generators (where $\\phi$ is Euler's totient function).\n*   Let $H_k = \\langle yx^k \\rangle$. The two generators of $H_k$ are $yx^k$ and $(yx^k)^3$.\n    $(yx^k)^3 = (yx^k)^2 \\cdot (yx^k) = x^{32}yx^k$.\n    Since $x^{32}$ is in the center of $Q_{128}$, $Z(Q_{128})=\\langle x^{32} \\rangle$, it commutes with all elements. So $x^{32}y = yx^{32}$.\n    $(yx^k)^3 = yx^{32}x^k = yx^{k+32}$.\n*   This means that the elements $yx^k$ and $yx^{k+32}$ generate the same subgroup: $\\langle yx^k \\rangle = \\langle yx^{k+32} \\rangle$.\n*   The 64 elements of the form $yx^k$ can be arranged in pairs $(yx^k, yx^{k+32})$ for $k=0, ..., 31$, where each pair generates the same subgroup.\n*   The number of distinct subgroups is the number of elements divided by the number of generators per subgroup: $64 / 2 = 32$.\nSo, there are **32** distinct cyclic subgroups generated by elements of the form $yx^k$.\n\n**Careful Point 3:** The calculation of the order of the elements $yx^k$ and the subsequent counting of distinct subgroups is the most complex part. A common mistake is to miscount the number of distinct subgroups. The key is understanding that multiple elements generate the same cyclic subgroup.\n\n**Step 5: Final Count**\n\nFinally, we combine the results from Step 3 and Step 4.\n*   From Step 3, we have 7 cyclic subgroups, all of which are contained in $\\langle x \\rangle$.\n*   From Step 4, we have 32 cyclic subgroups. None of these are contained in $\\langle x \\rangle$ because they contain elements of the form $yx^j$, which are not powers of $x$. For instance, the subgroup $\\langle yx^k \\rangle = \\{1, yx^k, x^{32}, yx^{k+32}\\}$ is not a subgroup of $\\langle x \\rangle$.\n*   Therefore, the two sets of subgroups are disjoint.\n\nThe total number of distinct power subgroups (cyclic subgroups) is the sum of the numbers from both cases.\nTotal number = (Subgroups from $\\langle x \\rangle$) + (Subgroups from $y\\langle x \\rangle$) = $7 + 32 = 39$.\n\n<<<39>>>"
