    "This problem asks for the equilibrium point of the Prisoner's Dilemma when played in a quantum setting. We are given the classical payoff matrix and the ability to design an optimal initial state.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Classical Game\n\nFirst, let's understand the standard Prisoner's Dilemma with the given payoff matrix:\n\n```\n        Player 2: Cooperate (C) | Player 2: Defect (D)\n--------------------------------------------------------------\nPlayer 1: C |      (5, 5)         |      (0, 7)\nPlayer 1: D |      (7, 0)         |      (1, 1)\n```\n*(Payoffs are listed as (Player 1, Player 2))*\n\nIn the classical version of the game:\n1.  If Player 2 Cooperates, Player 1 gets 5 for Cooperating but 7 for Defecting. Player 1 should Defect.\n2.  If Player 2 Defects, Player 1 gets 0 for Cooperating but 1 for Defecting. Player 1 should Defect.\n\nDefecting (D) is the dominant strategy for Player 1. Since the game is symmetric, it's also the dominant strategy for Player 2. The unique Nash Equilibrium is therefore (Defect, Defect), which results in a payoff of (1, 1) for each player. This outcome is suboptimal, as both players would be better off with the (Cooperate, Cooperate) outcome of (5, 5). This conflict between individual rationality and mutual benefit is the \"dilemma\".\n\n### Step 2: Set up the Quantum Game\n\nWe now move to the quantum realm using the Eisert-Wilkens-Lewenstein (EWL) protocol. The key elements are:\n\n1.  **Initial State:** The players share an entangled initial state. The prompt states \"You design the initial states for an optimal [outcome]\", which implies we should use a maximally entangled state. This state is created by an entangling operator `J` acting on the initial state `|CC⟩` (or `|00⟩`). A standard choice is `J = (1/√2)(I ⊗ I + i σ_x ⊗ σ_x)`, where `σ_x` is the Pauli-X matrix. The initial state of the game is `|ψ_initial⟩ = J|CC⟩ = (1/√2)(|CC⟩ + i|DD⟩)`.\n\n2.  **Strategies:** Players' strategies are no longer just C or D. They are single-qubit unitary operators. The classical strategies can be represented as specific unitary operators. A common convention is:\n    *   **Cooperate (C):** The identity operator, `Ĉ = I`.\n    *   **Defect (D):** A bit-flip operator, for example, `D̂ = iσ_x`.\n\n3.  **Payoff Calculation:** After players apply their chosen strategies (operators `Û_1` and `Û_2`), a disentangling operator `J†` (the conjugate transpose of `J`) is applied. The final state is `|ψ_final⟩ = J†(Û_1 ⊗ Û_2)|ψ_initial⟩`. This final state is then measured in the classical basis `{|CC⟩, |CD⟩, |DC⟩, |DD⟩}` to determine the outcome and corresponding payoffs.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Equilibria in the Quantum Game\n\nWe need to find the Nash Equilibrium in this new, expanded strategy space. A Nash Equilibrium is a set of strategies where no player can improve their payoff by unilaterally changing their strategy.\n\n1.  **The Classical Equilibrium `(D, D)`:** If we restrict players to only the classical strategies `Ĉ` and `D̂`, the resulting game still has (Defect, Defect) as a Nash Equilibrium. The quantum setup ensures that if both players choose `D̂`, the outcome is `|DD⟩` with certainty, leading to the same (1, 1) payoff. Thus, the unsatisfactory classical equilibrium persists in the quantum game.\n\n2.  **The New Quantum Equilibrium `(Q, Q)`:** The quantum framework allows for new strategies. A crucial new strategy, often called the \"miracle\" move, is represented by the operator `Q̂ = iσ_z` (a Pauli-Z gate with a phase). Let's analyze what happens when both players choose this quantum strategy `Q̂`.\n    *   **Strategy Pair `(Q̂, Q̂)`:** When both players apply `Q̂`, the final state `|ψ_final⟩` becomes `-|CC⟩`. The measurement outcome is `CC` with 100% probability. This leads to the payoff **(5, 5)**.\n\n3.  **Stability of the New Equilibrium:** For `(Q̂, Q̂)` to be a Nash Equilibrium, we must check that neither player has an incentive to unilaterally deviate. Let's assume Player 1 plays `Q̂` and Player 2 considers switching to another strategy.\n    *   **If Player 2 deviates to `Ĉ` (Cooperate):** The strategy pair is `(Q̂, Ĉ)`. Calculation shows the outcome is `DD` with 100% probability. The payoff becomes (1, 1). Player 2's payoff drops from 5 to 1. This is not a beneficial deviation.\n    *   **If Player 2 deviates to `D̂` (Defect):** The strategy pair is `(Q̂, D̂)`. Calculation shows the outcome is `DC` with 100% probability. The payoff is (7, 0). Player 2's payoff drops from 5 to 0. This is also not a beneficial deviation.\n\nSince deviating from `Q̂` (while the other player holds `Q̂`) to either of the classical strategies results in a lower payoff, and it can be shown this holds for any other quantum strategy, neither player will unilaterally change their move. Therefore, `(Q̂, Q̂)` is a stable Nash Equilibrium.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn the quantum version of the Prisoner's Dilemma with an optimally designed (maximally entangled) initial state, a new Nash Equilibrium emerges. This equilibrium corresponds to both players choosing the quantum strategy `Q̂`, which results in the payoff **(5, 5)**.\n\nThis outcome is the same as the (Cooperate, Cooperate) result but is stable against unilateral defection, thus resolving the dilemma. While the classical (Defect, Defect) equilibrium with payoff (1, 1) still exists, the new equilibrium is Pareto optimal, meaning it's better for at least one player without making anyone worse off. Rational players would aim for this superior equilibrium.\n\nThe equilibrium point, in terms of outcome, is the payoff pair (5, 5).\n\n<<(5,5)>>>"
