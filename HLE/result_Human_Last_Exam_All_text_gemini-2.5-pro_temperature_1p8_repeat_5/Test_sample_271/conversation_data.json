    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Factor the polynomial**\n\nLet $f(x) = x^7 - 2 x^5 - 9 x^3 + 3 x^2 + 18 x - 6$. We try to find a factorization by grouping terms.\nNotice the pattern in the coefficients. Let's group the terms as follows:\n$f(x) = (x^7 - 9x^3 + 3x^2) - (2x^5 - 18x + 6)$ -> not helpful\nLet's try another grouping:\n$f(x) = (x^7 - 2x^5) - (9x^3 - 18x) + (3x^2 - 6)$\n$f(x) = x^5(x^2 - 2) - 9x(x^2 - 2) + 3(x^2 - 2)$\nThis common factor $(x^2-2)$ allows us to factor the polynomial:\n$f(x) = (x^2 - 2)(x^5 - 9x + 3)$.\n\nLet $g(x) = x^2 - 2$ and $h(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$. The splitting field $K$ of $f(x)$ is the smallest field containing the roots of both $g(x)$ and $h(x)$.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the factors and their Galois groups**\n\n*   **Analysis of g(x) = x^2 - 2:**\n    The roots are $\\pm\\sqrt{2}$. The splitting field of $g(x)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is $F = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. This is a normal extension of degree 2. Its Galois group is $\\text{Gal}(F/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong S_2 \\cong C_2$.\n\n*   **Analysis of h(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3:**\n    1.  **Irreducibility:** We can use Eisenstein's criterion with the prime $p=3$. The leading coefficient (1) is not divisible by 3. All other coefficients (-9, 3) are divisible by 3. The constant term (3) is not divisible by $3^2=9$. Thus, $h(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n    2.  **Galois Group:** Let $E$ be the splitting field of $h(x)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$. The Galois group $G_h = \\text{Gal}(E/\\mathbb{Q})$ is a subgroup of $S_5$. Since $h(x)$ is irreducible of degree 5, $|G_h|$ is divisible by 5, so $G_h$ contains a 5-cycle.\n    To determine $G_h$ further, we find the number of real roots of $h(x)$.\n    $h'(x) = 5x^4 - 9$. The critical points are the roots of $h'(x)=0$, so $x^4 = 9/5$. This gives two real critical points $x = \\pm \\sqrt[4]{9/5}$.\n    Let $c = \\sqrt[4]{9/5}$.\n    $h(c) = c^5 - 9c + 3 = c(c^4) - 9c + 3 = c(9/5) - 9c + 3 = (3 - \\frac{36}{5}c)$. Since $c = \\sqrt[4]{1.8} > 1$, $h(c) = 3 - 7.2c < 0$.\n    $h(-c) = (-c)^5 - 9(-c) + 3 = -c^5 + 9c + 3 = -h(c) + 6 = 3 + \\frac{36}{5}c > 0$.\n    Since the local maximum is positive and the local minimum is negative, $h(x)$ has exactly 3 real roots and therefore 2 complex conjugate roots.\n    The complex conjugation map is an automorphism in $G_h$ which swaps the two complex roots and fixes the three real roots. This corresponds to a transposition in $S_5$.\n    A subgroup of $S_5$ that contains a 5-cycle and a transposition is $S_5$ itself.\n    So, $G_h = \\text{Gal}(E/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong S_5$. The degree of the extension is $[E:\\mathbb{Q}] = |S_5| = 120$.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Galois group of K over Q**\n\nThe splitting field $K$ is the compositum of $F = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ and $E$.\nThe Galois group $G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$ is isomorphic to the direct product $\\text{Gal}(F/\\mathbb{Q}) \\times \\text{Gal}(E/\\mathbb{Q})$ if and only if $F \\cap E = \\mathbb{Q}$.\nLet's check the intersection. Any subfield of $E$ corresponds to a subgroup of $G_h = S_5$. A quadratic subfield corresponds to a subgroup of index 2. The only subgroup of index 2 in $S_5$ is the alternating group $A_5$.\nThe field fixed by $A_5$ is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{D})$, where $D$ is the discriminant of $h(x)$.\nFor a polynomial $x^n+px+q$, the discriminant is $D = (-1)^{n(n-1)/2} (n^n q^{n-1} + (-1)^{n-1} (n-1)^{n-1} p^n)$.\nFor $h(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$, we have $n=5, p=-9, q=3$.\n$D = (-1)^{10}(5^5 \\cdot 3^4 + (-1)^4 \\cdot 4^4 \\cdot (-9)^5) = 3125 \\cdot 81 - 256 \\cdot 59049 = 253125 - 15116544 = -14863419$.\nThe quadratic subfield of $E$ is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-14863419})$, which is an imaginary quadratic field.\nSince $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ is a real quadratic field, $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}) \\neq \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{D})$. Thus, the intersection $F \\cap E = \\mathbb{Q}$.\nTherefore, $G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong \\text{Gal}(F/\\mathbb{Q}) \\times \\text{Gal}(E/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong S_2 \\times S_5$.\nThe order of the Galois group is $|G| = |S_2| \\cdot |S_5| = 2 \\cdot 120 = 240$. So $[K:\\mathbb{Q}]=240$.\n\n**Step 4: Find the degrees of normal intermediate fields**\n\nWe are looking for the possible degrees of normal field extensions $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ such that $\\mathbb{Q} \\subsetneq L \\subsetneq K$.\nBy the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory, these extensions $L$ correspond to normal subgroups $H$ of $G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$ such that $\\{e\\} \\subsetneq H \\subsetneq G$.\nThe degree of the extension is $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = [G:H] = |G|/|H|$.\n\nWe need to find all proper non-trivial normal subgroups of $G = S_2 \\times S_5$.\nThe normal subgroups of $S_2$ are $\\{e\\}$ and $S_2$.\nThe normal subgroups of $S_5$ are $\\{e\\}$, $A_5$, and $S_5$.\nThe normal subgroups of a direct product $G_1 \\times G_2$ are not just products of normal subgroups of $G_1$ and $G_2$, but we can analyze them systematically.\n\nLet $H \\unlhd S_2 \\times S_5$.\n1.  **Product-type normal subgroups:** These are of the form $N_1 \\times N_2$ where $N_1 \\unlhd S_2$ and $N_2 \\unlhd S_5$.\n    *   $H = \\{e\\} \\times A_5$: $|H|=60$. $[G:H] = 240/60 = 4$.\n    *   $H = \\{e\\} \\times S_5$: $|H|=120$. $[G:H] = 240/120 = 2$.\n    *   $H = S_2 \\times \\{e\\}$: $|H|=2$. $[G:H] = 240/2 = 120$.\n    *   $H = S_2 \\times A_5$: $|H|=2 \\cdot 60=120$. $[G:H] = 240/120 = 2$.\n    The other products, $\\{e\\}\\times\\{e\\}$ and $S_2\\times S_5$, correspond to $L=K$ and $L=\\mathbb{Q}$, which are excluded.\n\n2.  **Diagonal-type normal subgroups:** These arise when there is an isomorphism between quotient groups of the factors. Let $q_1: S_2 \\to S_2/\\{e\\} \\cong C_2$ and $q_2: S_5 \\to S_5/A_5 \\cong C_2$ be quotient maps. We can form a normal subgroup by taking the pullback of the diagonal subgroup of $C_2 \\times C_2$.\n    Let $H_{diag} = \\{(g,h) \\in S_2 \\times S_5 \\mid q_1(g) = q_2(h)\\}$.\n    This means either $g$ is the identity in $S_2$ and $h \\in A_5$ (an even permutation), or $g$ is the non-identity element in $S_2$ and $h \\notin A_5$ (an odd permutation).\n    $H_{diag} = (\\{e\\} \\times A_5) \\cup (S_2\\setminus\\{e\\} \\times S_5\\setminus A_5)$.\n    $|H_{diag}| = |\\{e\\} \\times A_5| + |S_2\\setminus\\{e\\} \\times S_5\\setminus A_5| = 1 \\cdot 60 + 1 \\cdot (120-60) = 120$.\n    The index of this subgroup is $[G:H_{diag}] = 240/120 = 2$.\n\nNo other isomorphisms between quotients exist for $S_2$ and $S_5$. Thus, we have found all proper non-trivial normal subgroups.\n\n**Step 5: List the possible degrees**\n\nThe possible indices of the proper non-trivial normal subgroups of $G=S_2 \\times S_5$ are:\n*   From $\\{e\\} \\times A_5$: index is 4.\n*   From $\\{e\\} \\times S_5$: index is 2.\n*   From $S_2 \\times \\{e\\}$: index is 120.\n*   From $S_2 \\times A_5$: index is 2.\n*   From $H_{diag}$: index is 2.\n\nThe set of possible values for the degree $[L:\\mathbb{Q}]$ is the set of these indices.\nThe distinct values for the degrees are 2, 4, and 120.\n\nFinal Answer Formulation: The problem asks for a list of all possible degrees. Based on the analysis, these degrees are 2, 4, and 120.\n\n<<<2, 4, 120>>>"
