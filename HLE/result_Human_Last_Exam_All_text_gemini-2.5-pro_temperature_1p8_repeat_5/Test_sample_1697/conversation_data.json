    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction to determine the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the starting material and reagents.**\n*   **Starting Material:** N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide.\n    *   The \"benzamide\" core consists of a benzene ring bonded to a carbonyl group, which is in turn bonded to a nitrogen atom.\n    *   \"N,N-diethyl\" indicates two ethyl groups (-CH₂CH₃) are attached to the amide nitrogen. The structure of this group is -C(=O)N(CH₂CH₃)₂.\n    *   \"3-dimethylamino\" indicates a dimethylamino group (-N(CH₃)₂) is attached to the benzene ring at position 3, relative to the benzamide group (which is at position 1).\n*   **Reagents for the first step:** sec-BuLi (sec-butyllithium), TMEDA (N,N,N',N'-tetramethylethylenediamine), and THF (tetrahydrofuran).\n    *   sec-BuLi is a very strong base.\n    *   TMEDA is a ligand that coordinates to the lithium ion (Li⁺), enhancing the basicity of the sec-butyl anion.\n    *   This combination of reagents (sec-BuLi/TMEDA) is a classic system used for a specific type of reaction called Directed ortho-Metalation (DoM). This reaction involves the deprotonation of a proton that is ortho (adjacent) to a \"directing group\" on an aromatic ring.\n*   **Reagent for the second step:** Methyl iodide (CH₃I).\n    *   Methyl iodide is an electrophile, meaning it readily accepts electrons. It is a common methylating agent.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the most acidic proton for deprotonation.**\nIn a Directed ortho-Metalation reaction, the strong base removes the most acidic proton on the aromatic ring. The acidity is enhanced by substituents called Directed Metalation Groups (DMGs). These groups can coordinate with the lithium ion, directing the base to a nearby ortho-proton.\nOur starting material has two powerful DMGs:\n1.  **The N,N-diethylcarboxamide group (-CONEt₂)** at position C1. The carbonyl oxygen is an excellent Lewis base and can coordinate with the lithium ion, directing deprotonation to the ortho positions (C2 and C6).\n2.  **The dimethylamino group (-NMe₂)** at position C3. The lone pair on the nitrogen can also coordinate with the lithium ion, directing deprotonation to its ortho positions (C2 and C4).\n\n**Step 3: Determine the site of metalation (lithiation).**\nWe need to determine which proton will be removed. Let's look at the positions activated by the two DMGs:\n*   The proton at **C2** is ortho to *both* the -CONEt₂ group and the -NMe₂ group.\n*   The proton at **C4** is ortho only to the -NMe₂ group.\n*   The proton at **C6** is ortho only to the -CONEt₂ group.\n\nWhen a position on a benzene ring is ortho to two cooperating DMGs, it becomes exceptionally acidic and is the overwhelmingly preferred site for deprotonation. This is a synergistic effect. Therefore, sec-BuLi will selectively remove the proton at the C2 position, creating a highly nucleophilic aryllithium intermediate.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the reaction with the electrophile.**\nThe aryllithium intermediate formed in the first step has a negatively charged carbon atom at the C2 position. In the second step, this nucleophile attacks the electrophilic methyl group of methyl iodide (CH₃I). The iodide ion (I⁻) acts as the leaving group. This reaction attaches a methyl group (-CH₃) to the C2 position of the benzene ring.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude the structure of the final product.**\nStarting with N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide, the reaction sequence replaces the hydrogen atom at the C2 position with a methyl group. The rest of the molecule remains unchanged.\nThe final product is named by listing the substituents alphabetically. The substituents on the ring are at position 2 (methyl) and position 3 (dimethylamino). Alphabetically, \"dimethylamino\" comes before \"methyl\".\n\nTherefore, the final product is **N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylamino-2-methylbenzamide**.\n\n<<<N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylamino-2-methylbenzamide>>>"
