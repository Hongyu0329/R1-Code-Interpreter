    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Clues**\n\n*   **Clue 1: The poetic description.** The man was called \"a joy-discovering sailor\" by the Russian poet Andrei Voznesensky. This points to a person associated with exploration, the sea, and bringing something new or positive.\n*   **Clue 2: The poetic question.** Voznesensky's poem also contained the question, \"Where is your grave, even a mound?\". This is a very strong clue, indicating that the man's burial site was unknown for a very long time.\n*   **Clue 3: The historical timeline.** The answer to the question about his grave \"emerged in the late 1980s.\" This sets a specific time frame for the discovery or rediscovery of the burial location.\n*   **The Question:** The final goal is to identify the last name of this man.\n\n**Step 2: Connecting the Clues**\n\n*   We need to find a poem by Andrei Voznesensky that is about a sailor/explorer whose grave was lost. The lines quoted are from Voznesensky's libretto for the famous Russian rock opera *Juno and Avos* (Юнона и Авось).\n*   The central historical figure of *Juno and Avos* is Nikolai Rezanov. He was a Russian nobleman, diplomat, and one of the founders of the Russian-American Company. His expeditions and leadership of Russia's first circumnavigation of the globe certainly qualify him as a \"sailor.\"\n*   Nikolai Rezanov died in 1807 in Krasnoyarsk, Siberia, while returning from his mission to California. He was buried at the Voskresensky Cathedral cemetery. However, in the Soviet era, the cathedral was destroyed, and the cemetery was paved over, leading to the location of his grave being completely lost for decades. This directly corresponds to Voznesensky's line, \"Where is your grave, even a mound?\"\n*   The final piece of the puzzle is the discovery in the \"late 1980s.\" During the period of *Glasnost* under Mikhail Gorbachev, there was a resurgence of interest in pre-revolutionary Russian history. Historians and local enthusiasts in Krasnoyarsk began a serious effort to locate the lost grave of Rezanov. Their research pinpointed the probable location of the original cemetery, effectively \"answering\" the question of where he was buried, even though the grave itself could not be recovered. This effort led to the erection of a memorial monument on the site.\n\n**Step 3: Final Conclusion**\n\nThe man who fits all the clues—the subject of Voznesensky's famous work, a \"sailor\" whose grave was lost for over a century, and whose burial place was rediscovered and memorialized in the late 1980s—is Nikolai Rezanov. The question asks for his last name.\n\n<<<Rezanov>>>"
