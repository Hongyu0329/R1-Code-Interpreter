    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the book of manners preserved alongside \"Sir Launfal\".\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Source of \"Sir Launfal\":** The poem \"Sir Launfal,\" written by Thomas Chestre in the late 14th century, survives in only a single manuscript. This is a critical piece of information because \"preserved alongside\" refers to the other texts included in this specific physical document.\n\n2.  **Name the Manuscript:** The unique manuscript that contains \"Sir Launfal\" is known as **Cotton Caligula A.ii**. It is held in the British Library. This manuscript is a miscellany, meaning it's a collection of various unrelated works bound together.\n\n3.  **Examine the Contents of the Manuscript:** To find the \"book of manners,\" we must look at the list of texts included in Cotton Caligula A.ii alongside \"Sir Launfal.\" The manuscript contains a collection of Middle English romances and didactic (instructional) poems.\n\n4.  **Define \"Book of Manners\":** In the medieval context, a \"book of manners\" is a didactic work intended to teach proper social conduct, etiquette, and moral behavior. These were often structured as advice from a parent to a child.\n\n5.  **Identify the \"Book of Manners\" in the Manuscript:** Among the various romances like *Sir Orfeo* and *Emar√©*, the manuscript Cotton Caligula A.ii also contains two well-known didactic poems that fit the description of a book of manners:\n    *   ***How the Goode Wife Taught Hyr Doughter*** (sometimes titled *The Good Wyfe Wold a Pylgremage*)\n    *   ***How the Wise Man Taught hys Sone***\n\n6.  **Select the Correct Answer:** Both of these texts are \"books of manners.\" However, *How the Goode Wife Taught Hyr Doughter* is a classic and very direct example of the genre, providing detailed instructions to a young woman on how to conduct herself in society and manage a household. It is a perfect fit for the question's description.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Uniqueness of the Manuscript:** The fact that \"Sir Launfal\" exists in only one manuscript is key. This narrows the search down to the contents of that specific collection, Cotton Caligula A.ii.\n*   **Genre Recognition:** One must be able to distinguish between a romance (like \"Sir Launfal\") and a didactic book of manners (like *How the Goode Wife Taught Hyr Doughter*). The former is a narrative adventure story, while the latter is a set of instructions for proper living.\n*   **Presence of Multiple Correct Texts:** The manuscript contains two texts that could be considered books of manners. However, the question asks for \"a book,\" and *How the Goode Wife Taught Hyr Doughter* is a prime example of the genre.\n\nBy following these steps, we can confidently identify the text the question is referring to.\n\n<<<How the Goode Wife Taught Hyr Doughter>>>"
