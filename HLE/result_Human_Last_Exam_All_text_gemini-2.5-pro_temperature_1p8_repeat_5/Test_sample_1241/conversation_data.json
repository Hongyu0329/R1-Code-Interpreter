    "This problem requires finding the steady-state probabilities of a continuous-time Markov chain and then calculating the sum of two of these probabilities. The system is described by the Kolmogorov-Chepmen system of equations.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal**\n    The question asks for the value of $P_{0}(+\\infty) + P_{1}(+\\infty)$. This corresponds to the sum of the steady-state probabilities for state 0 and state 1. Let's denote the steady-state probability of being in state $i$ as $\\pi_i = P_i(+\\infty)$. The goal is to compute $\\pi_0 + \\pi_1$.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Steady-State Equations**\n    In the steady state (as $t \\to +\\infty$), the probabilities no longer change with time. Therefore, the derivatives $P_i'(t)$ are all zero. Setting $P_i'(t) = 0$ in the given system of differential equations yields a system of linear algebraic equations:\n    (1) $0 = -\\lambda_{01}\\pi_{0} + \\lambda_{10}\\pi_{1}$\n    (2) $0 = \\lambda_{01}\\pi_{0} - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12})\\pi_{1} + \\lambda_{21}\\pi_{2} + \\lambda_{31}\\pi_{3}$\n    (3) $0 = \\lambda_{12}\\pi_{1} - (\\lambda_{21}  + \\lambda_{23})\\pi_{2}$\n    (4) $0 = \\lambda_{23}\\pi_{2} - \\lambda_{31}\\pi_{3}$\n\n    Additionally, the sum of all probabilities must be equal to 1:\n    (5) $\\pi_{0} + \\pi_{1} + \\pi_{2} + \\pi_{3} = 1$\n\n3.  **Substitute the Given Transition Rates**\n    We are given the following values for the transition rates:\n    $\\lambda_{01} = 0.019$, $\\lambda_{10} = 0.65$, $\\lambda_{12} = 0.4$, $\\lambda_{21} = 0.392$, $\\lambda_{23} = 0.008$, $\\lambda_{31} = 0.008$.\n    Substituting these values into the equations:\n    (1) $0 = -0.019\\pi_{0} + 0.65\\pi_{1}$\n    (3) $0 = 0.4\\pi_{1} - (0.392 + 0.008)\\pi_{2} \\implies 0 = 0.4\\pi_{1} - 0.4\\pi_{2}$\n    (4) $0 = 0.008\\pi_{2} - 0.008\\pi_{3}$\n\n4.  **Solve the System of Equations**\n    We can solve this system by expressing $\\pi_0, \\pi_2, \\pi_3$ in terms of $\\pi_1$.\n    *   From equation (4): $0.008\\pi_2 = 0.008\\pi_3 \\implies \\pi_3 = \\pi_2$.\n    *   From equation (3): $0.4\\pi_1 = 0.4\\pi_2 \\implies \\pi_2 = \\pi_1$.\n    *   Combining these results, we have $\\pi_1 = \\pi_2 = \\pi_3$.\n    *   From equation (1): $0.019\\pi_0 = 0.65\\pi_1 \\implies \\pi_0 = \\frac{0.65}{0.019}\\pi_1$. To avoid rounding errors, we can write this as a fraction of integers: $\\pi_0 = \\frac{650}{19}\\pi_1$.\n\n5.  **Use the Normalization Condition**\n    Now we substitute these relationships into the normalization equation (5):\n    $\\pi_0 + \\pi_1 + \\pi_2 + \\pi_3 = 1$\n    $(\\frac{650}{19}\\pi_1) + \\pi_1 + \\pi_1 + \\pi_1 = 1$\n    To combine the terms, we find a common denominator:\n    $(\\frac{650}{19} + \\frac{19}{19} + \\frac{19}{19} + \\frac{19}{19})\\pi_1 = 1$\n    $(\\frac{650}{19} + 3)\\pi_1 = 1$\n    $(\\frac{650 + 3 \\times 19}{19})\\pi_1 = 1$\n    $(\\frac{650 + 57}{19})\\pi_1 = 1$\n    $\\frac{707}{19}\\pi_1 = 1$\n    This gives the value for $\\pi_1$:\n    $\\pi_1 = \\frac{19}{707}$.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Answer**\n    We need to find $\\pi_0 + \\pi_1$. We already have $\\pi_1$. Now we find $\\pi_0$:\n    $\\pi_0 = \\frac{650}{19}\\pi_1 = \\frac{650}{19} \\times \\frac{19}{707} = \\frac{650}{707}$.\n    Finally, we sum the two probabilities:\n    $\\pi_0 + \\pi_1 = \\frac{650}{707} + \\frac{19}{707} = \\frac{650 + 19}{707} = \\frac{669}{707}$.\n\n    To get the final numerical answer, we perform the division:\n    $\\frac{669}{707} \\approx 0.946251768...$\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n*   The problem describes a continuous-time Markov chain, and finding $P_i(+\\infty)$ means finding the stationary (or limiting) distribution.\n*   The steady state is characterized by the condition $P_i'(t) = 0$ for all states $i$.\n*   The system of balance equations obtained from $P_i'(t)=0$ is linearly dependent. The normalization condition $\\sum \\pi_i = 1$ is crucial for finding a unique solution.\n*   To avoid precision issues, it's best to work with fractions for as long as possible before performing the final division. The given decimal parameters are exact and can be converted to fractions if needed (e.g., $0.65 = 65/100$), but here it's easier to work with them directly and handle ratios like $0.65/0.019$ as $650/19$.\n*   A quick check shows the Markov chain is irreducible (it's possible to get from any state to any other state), which guarantees the existence of a unique stationary distribution.\n\nFinal Answer Calculation:\n$\\pi_0 + \\pi_1 = \\frac{669}{707} \\approx 0.94625$\n\n<<<0.94625>>>"
