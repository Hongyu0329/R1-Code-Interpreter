    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the core elements of the question.**\nThe question asks about a specific painting: a self-portrait by Curt Querner, painted in 1933 after escaping the Gestapo. The key information needed is what object he is holding and what it symbolizes.\n\n**Step 2: Research the specific artwork.**\nThe painting in question is Curt Querner's \"Selbstbildnis mit Distel\" or \"Self-Portrait with Thistle,\" created in 1933. This confirms the subject, artist, and year.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the historical context.**\n*   **1933 in Germany:** This was a pivotal year. Adolf Hitler was appointed Chancellor, and the Nazi Party began consolidating power.\n*   **The Gestapo:** The Geheime Staatspolizei (Secret State Police) was established to crush political dissent.\n*   **Curt Querner's situation:** Querner was associated with left-wing political groups and was arrested by the Gestapo in Dresden. He managed to escape. The self-portrait was painted in the immediate aftermath of this event, making its content highly significant.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the object being held.**\nIn the painting, Querner holds a plant in his right hand, presenting it to the viewer. This plant, with its prickly stem and distinct flower head, is a thistle.\n\n**Step 5: Interpret the symbolism of the object.**\nThis is the most crucial part of the analysis. The choice of a thistle is not random; it is a deliberate symbolic act.\n*   **Careful Point 1: The nature of the thistle.** A thistle is a hardy, resilient plant often considered a weed. It has sharp thorns for protection and can survive in harsh conditions where other plants cannot.\n*   **Careful Point 2: Connecting the symbol to the context.** Given that Querner had just escaped the Nazi secret police, the thistle becomes a powerful metaphor for himself.\n    *   **Defiance and Resistance:** The thorns and the plant's tough nature symbolize an unyielding, defiant spirit. He is showing that he will not be easily crushed or intimidated by the oppressive regime.\n    *   **Resilience:** The ability of the thistle to thrive in difficult environments represents Querner's own personal resilience and unbroken will after his arrest and escape.\n    *   **Unyielding Stance:** By holding the thistle, he is making a non-verbal, public declaration of his inner strength and his opposition to the political forces trying to silence him.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nIn his 1933 self-portrait, painted after escaping the Gestapo, Curt Querner holds a thistle. This object serves as a powerful symbol of his personal defiance, resilience, and unbroken resistance against the nascent Nazi dictatorship.\n\n<<<In his self-portrait from 1933, Curt Querner is holding a thistle.
