Within the Renormalization Group framework and to the leading order in the epsilon expansion ($\epsilon = 4-d$), the specific heat critical exponent $\alpha$ scales quantitatively with the spatial dimensionality $d$ according to the formula:
$\alpha \approx \frac{4-N}{2(N+8)}(4-d)$
where N is the number of components of the scalar order parameter field.
