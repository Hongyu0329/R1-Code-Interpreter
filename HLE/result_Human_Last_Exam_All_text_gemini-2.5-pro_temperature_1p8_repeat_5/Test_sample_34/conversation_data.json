    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the worst suited jack to open from the button in a 100BB rake-free cash game.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Scenario's Key Elements\n\n1.  **Position: Button (BTN)**\n    *   The button is the most powerful position in poker. You are guaranteed to act last on every post-flop street (flop, turn, river).\n    *   This positional advantage allows you to realize your equity more effectively and apply pressure, justifying the widest opening range of any position.\n\n2.  **Game Format: 100BB Rake-Free Cash Game**\n    *   **100BB stacks** is the standard depth, meaning typical pre-flop strategies apply.\n    *   **Rake-Free** is a critical detail. In a normal game, the house takes a percentage of the pot (the rake). To be profitable, your hand must win more than the rake threshold. In a rake-free environment, any hand with any amount of positive expected value (EV), no matter how small, becomes a profitable open. This dramatically widens your opening range compared to a raked game.\n\n3.  **The Question: What is the \"worst suited jack\" you should open?**\n    *   This implies we are looking for the hand at the bottom edge of the opening range within the JXs category (where X is any card from 2 to T).\n    *   \"Should open\" means the hand is considered a profitable, standard open in a Game Theory Optimal (GTO) strategy for this scenario. The \"worst\" is the one among these profitable opens that has the lowest EV.\n\n### Step 2: Evaluating Suited Jack Hands (JXs)\n\nSuited hands derive their value from a combination of factors:\n*   **High Card Value:** The Jack provides decent high card strength.\n*   **Flush Potential:** Being suited is a major advantage, giving you access to powerful flush and flush-draw hands. This is the primary value driver for weaker suited hands.\n*   **Straight Potential:** The kicker determines how well the hand connects with other cards to make straights.\n\nLet's rank the JXs hands:\n*   **JTs, J9s, J8s:** These are strong hands. They are suited connectors or one-gappers, making them excellent candidates for straights and flushes. They are at the top of the JXs range.\n*   **J7s, J6s:** Still very playable suited gappers.\n*   **J5s, J4s, J3s, J2s:** These are the weakest suited Jacks. Their straight potential is diminished because of the large gap between the Jack and the kicker. Their value relies more heavily on making a flush or a Jack-high hand.\n\n### Step 3: Determining the Opening Range Threshold\n\nGiven the position (Button) and the rake-free environment, the GTO opening range is extremely wide. A standard GTO solver for a 100BB, rake-free, 6-max game recommends opening roughly 50-55% of all hands from the button. This includes **all suited Jack combinations.**\n\nSince every JXs hand from JTs down to J2s is considered a profitable open in this scenario, the question is simply asking to identify which of these hands is the weakest.\n\n### Step 4: Identifying the Worst Hand in the Range\n\nThe principle for ranking these bottom-tier suited hands is straightforward: **a higher kicker is always better, all else being equal.**\n\n*   A higher kicker means better high card strength when you don't improve. For example, if the board is A-K-8-7-6, your J3s plays as a Jack-high with a 3 kicker, which is better than a J2s.\n*   A higher kicker offers slightly better straight possibilities that connect with your Jack.\n*   There are no special exceptions where a lower kicker (like a 2) is preferable to a higher one (like a 3) in this context. J3s is strictly a better hand than J2s.\n\nTherefore, the weakest suited Jack that is still a standard, profitable open-raise is the one with the lowest possible kicker.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe hierarchy of suited Jacks is JTs > J9s > ... > J4s > J3s > J2s. Since GTO strategy dictates opening all suited Jacks from the button in this specific rake-free scenario, the \"worst\" one you should still open is the one at the very bottom of this list.\n\nThe answer is **Jack-Deuce suited**.\n\n<<<J2s>>>"
