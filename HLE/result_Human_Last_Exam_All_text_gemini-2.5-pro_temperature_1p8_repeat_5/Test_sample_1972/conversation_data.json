    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the novel and author in question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Clues:** The question provides two very specific clues attributed to Jorge Luis Borges:\n    *   **Clue A (Description of the Author):** The author is a \"continuator (and simplifier) of Faulkner.\" This points to a 20th-century writer, likely from the Americas, whose style is indebted to William Faulkner but is perhaps less baroque or complex in its structure (e.g., less convoluted timelines or more straightforward streams of consciousness).\n    *   **Clue B (Description of the Novel):** The work has \"the intensity of a tiger and the variety that a chess duel can achieve.\" This metaphor suggests a combination of raw, visceral, primal power (\"intensity of a tiger\") with intricate, intellectual, and strategic complexity (\"variety that a chess duel can achieve\").\n\n2.  **Identify the Source of the Quotation:** These descriptions are hallmarks of Borges's critical writing, which often appeared in prologues he wrote for other authors' books, particularly for his curated \"Biblioteca Personal\" (Personal Library) series. The task is to find the specific prologue or review where he uses this exact language.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Potential Candidates:**\n    *   The reference to Faulkner strongly suggests a writer from the Latin American Boom, as many authors from that movement (like Gabriel García Márquez, Mario Vargas Llosa, and Juan Carlos Onetti) were profoundly influenced by him.\n    *   **Juan Carlos Onetti**, a Uruguayan novelist, is a prime candidate. He is famous for creating the mythical city of Santa María, mirroring Faulkner's Yoknapatawpha County, and his work is known for its pessimistic, existentialist tone. Borges held Onetti in high regard.\n\n4.  **Confirm the Connection:** A search for these specific phrases in Borges's writings confirms their origin. The quote and the description come from the prologue Borges wrote for **Juan Carlos Onetti's** novel **\"El astillero\"** (\"The Shipyard\"). Borges included this novel in his \"Biblioteca Personal\" collection in 1985.\n\n5.  **Analyze the Original Text:** In the prologue to *El astillero*, Borges writes (translation):\n    > *\"Faulkner had already explored that territory of ignominy and evil, but Onetti's continuator is also a simplifier. Onetti dispenses with the vast and sometimes cumbersome chronological disorder and the confused streams of consciousness... Onetti's work has at once the intensity of a tiger and the variety that a chess duel can achieve.\"*\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** The text explicitly names Onetti as a \"continuator\" and \"simplifier\" of Faulkner. It then uses the precise tiger and chess duel metaphor to describe his work, in the context of introducing the novel *El astillero*. Therefore, the novel Borges is referring to is *El astillero* by Juan Carlos Onetti.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe novel is **El astillero** (published in English as **The Shipyard**) by **Juan Carlos Onetti**.\n\n<<<El astillero (The Shipyard)>>>"
