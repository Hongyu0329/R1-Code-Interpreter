    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the book and author:** The novel in question is \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość\" (Perfect Imperfection) written by Jacek Dukaj.\n2.  **Identify the main character:** The protagonist of the novel is Adam Zamoyski, an astronaut from the 21st century who is resurrected in a far-future, posthuman civilization.\n3.  **Identify the central relationship:** After his resurrection, Adam Zamoyski's primary guide, companion, and protector is a posthuman entity known as a \"phoebe.\" Her name is Angelika.\n4.  **Analyze the nature of their relationship:** The bond between Adam and Angelika is a core element of the plot. It evolves from a professional relationship to a deep, personal, and symbiotic partnership. They rely on each other for survival and to navigate the complex world they inhabit.\n5.  **Determine if a marriage occurs:** While the novel's setting is far removed from 21st-century norms, the culmination of Adam and Angelika's relationship is a permanent union. They decide to bind themselves together in a way that is the narrative's equivalent of a marriage, forming a single \"we-being\" to face the future. This act represents their ultimate commitment to one another.\n6.  **Conclude the name:** Therefore, the character that the main character, Adam Zamoyski, marries is Angelika.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   The main character's name is Adam Zamoyski. Identifying him is the first crucial step.\n*   The concept of \"marriage\" in this science fiction novel is not traditional. It's a posthuman form of union, but it serves the same narrative function as a marriage, signifying a permanent, committed partnership.\n*   Angelika's role is central; she isn't a minor character. She is introduced early and her relationship with Adam is the primary emotional arc of the story.\n\n<<<Angelika>>>"
