    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the minimal number of triangles for triangulating the outer-hull of the great icosahedron.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the geometric object**: The object is the **great icosahedron**. This is one of the four non-convex regular polyhedra known as the Kepler-Poinsot polyhedra. It is composed of 20 intersecting equilateral triangles.\n\n2.  **Understand the core of the question**: The question asks about the **outer-hull** (also known as the convex hull) of the great icosahedron, not the great icosahedron itself. The convex hull of a set of points (or a geometric shape) is the smallest convex set that contains all the points.\n\n3.  **Determine the convex hull of the great icosahedron**:\n    *   A key property of the great icosahedron is that its 12 vertices are located at the exact same positions as the vertices of a standard, convex **regular icosahedron**.\n    *   Since the convex hull is the smallest convex shape enclosing all vertices, and a regular icosahedron is a convex shape whose vertices are precisely the vertices of the great icosahedron, the convex hull of the great icosahedron is the regular icosahedron.\n\n4.  **Analyze the \"triangulation\"**: The question asks for the \"minimal number of triangles needed for triangulating the outer-hull\".\n    *   The outer-hull is a regular icosahedron.\n    *   A regular icosahedron is a Platonic solid whose surface is already composed entirely of triangular faces. Specifically, it has 20 equilateral triangles as its faces.\n    *   Therefore, the surface of the regular icosahedron is already perfectly triangulated. The \"minimal triangulation\" simply uses these existing faces without any further subdivision.\n\n5.  **Count the \"visible triangles from the outside\"**: This phrase refers to the number of faces on the surface of the convex hull.\n    *   As established, the convex hull is a regular icosahedron.\n    *   By definition, a regular icosahedron has **20** faces.\n    *   All these 20 triangular faces form the exterior, visible surface of the hull.\n\n### List of Careful Points\n\n*   **Distinguish between the great icosahedron and its convex hull**: The great icosahedron is a complex, self-intersecting shape. The question, however, is about its much simpler convex hull. The internal structure of the great icosahedron is irrelevant.\n*   **Recognize the convex hull**: The crucial piece of information is that the vertices of the great icosahedron coincide with those of the regular icosahedron. This directly implies that the convex hull is a regular icosahedron.\n*   **Understand \"minimal triangulation\"**: Since the faces of the target shape (the icosahedron) are already triangles, no further subdivision is necessary. The minimal number of triangles is simply the number of faces of the shape itself.\n*   **Interpret \"visible from the outside\"**: This confirms that we are dealing with the external surface of the convex hull and not any internal partitions.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe problem reduces to finding the number of faces on a regular icosahedron. A regular icosahedron has 20 triangular faces.\n\n<<<20>>>"
