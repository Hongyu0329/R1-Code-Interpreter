    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the ratio of the products.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Reactant and the Reaction**\n*   **Reactant:** The reactant is \\((2Z,4Z,6Z,8E)\\)-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene. This is a linear conjugated polyene with 8 π-electrons in its core conjugated system (from C2 to C9). It has a methyl substituent at each end of the conjugated system (C1 and C10 are the methyl groups).\n*   **Reaction:** The reaction is a thermal electrocyclic reaction. This involves the formation of a sigma bond between the two ends of the conjugated system (C2 and C9) to form a cyclic compound. The product is a substituted cyclooctatriene, specifically 1,2-dimethylcycloocta-1,3,5-triene. The problem states that two isomeric products are formed: a *cis*-isomer A and a *trans*-isomer B, referring to the relative stereochemistry of the two methyl groups.\n\n**Step 2: Apply Frontier Molecular Orbital (FMO) Theory and Woodward-Hoffmann Rules**\n*   The reacting system is a conjugated octatetraene, which contains 8 π-electrons.\n*   Systems with 4n π-electrons (where n=2 for 8 electrons) undergo electrocyclic reactions under thermal conditions via a **conrotatory** motion.\n*   This can be derived from FMO theory. For an 8π system, the electrons occupy the first four molecular orbitals (ψ1, ψ2, ψ3, ψ4). The Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO) is ψ4.\n*   The HOMO (ψ4) of a linear octatetraene has C2 rotational symmetry. This means the p-orbital lobes at the two ends of the conjugated system (C2 and C9) have opposite phases.\n*   To form a bonding sigma orbital (constructive overlap of lobes with the same phase), the two ends of the molecule must rotate in the same direction (either both clockwise or both counter-clockwise). This motion is defined as **conrotatory**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Stereochemical Outcome of the Conrotatory Closure**\n*   The formation of two diastereomeric products (cis-A and trans-B) implies that there are two possible conrotatory pathways leading to different products. The ratio of the products will be determined by the relative stability of the transition states for these two pathways.\n*   The stability of the transition states is primarily governed by steric hindrance between the substituents on the terminal carbons (C2 and C9) as they rotate. The substituents are a methyl group and a hydrogen atom on each carbon.\n*   Let's analyze the two competing pathways:\n    *   **Pathway to form *trans*-isomer B:** For the two methyl groups to end up on opposite faces of the newly formed ring (trans configuration), the conrotatory motion must proceed in a way that one methyl group and one hydrogen atom rotate \"inward\" and pass each other in the transition state. This transition state is destabilized by a **methyl-hydrogen (Me-H) steric interaction**.\n    *   **Pathway to form *cis*-isomer A:** For the two methyl groups to end up on the same face of the ring (cis configuration), the conrotatory motion must proceed such that the two methyl groups rotate \"inward\" and pass each other. This transition state is destabilized by a **methyl-methyl (Me-Me) steric interaction**.\n\n**Step 4: Compare the Energies of the Transition States**\n*   A methyl group is significantly larger than a hydrogen atom.\n*   The steric repulsion in a Me-Me interaction is much greater than in a Me-H interaction.\n*   Therefore, the transition state leading to the *cis*-isomer A (TS_A), which involves a severe Me-Me clash, is significantly higher in energy than the transition state leading to the *trans*-isomer B (TS_B), which involves a much smaller Me-H clash.\n*   So, we can conclude: Energy(TS_A) > Energy(TS_B).\n\n**Step 5: Predict the Ratio of Products**\n*   According to the Curtin-Hammett principle, in a reaction that can produce two or more products from equilibrating conformers or via different pathways, the product ratio is determined by the difference in the free energies of the transition states leading to those products.\n*   The reaction pathway with the lower activation energy will be faster and will yield the major product.\n*   Since Energy(TS_A) > Energy(TS_B), the activation energy for the formation of A is higher than for the formation of B.\n*   Consequently, the formation of the *trans*-isomer B is kinetically favored and will be the major product. The *cis*-isomer A will be the minor product.\n*   The ratio of A:B will be significantly less than 1.\n\n**Final Conclusion**\nThe reaction strongly favors the pathway with the lower steric hindrance in its transition state. The formation of the *trans*-isomer B involves a sterically less demanding Me-H interaction, whereas the formation of the *cis*-isomer A involves a highly unfavorable Me-Me interaction. Therefore, the *trans*-isomer B is the major product, and the *cis*-isomer A is the minor product. The ratio of A to B is small.\n\n<<<The ratio of product A to product B is small (A:B << 1), with the trans-isomer B being the major product.>>>"
