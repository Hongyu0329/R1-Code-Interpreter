    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the finite filled nilpotent groups.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Definitions\n\nFirst, let's break down the key terms in the question.\n\n*   **Product-Free Set:** A non-empty subset `S` of a finite group `G` is called product-free if for any two elements `x, y` in `S` (including the case `x=y`), their product `xy` is not in `S`. This can be written as `SS \\cap S = \\emptyset`, where `SS = {xy | x, y \\in S}`.\n    *   **Careful Point:** A direct consequence of this definition is that the identity element `e` can never be a member of a product-free set, because `e * e = e`.\n\n*   **Maximum by inclusion Product-Free Set (MIPFS):** A product-free set `S` is said to be maximal by inclusion if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set in `G`. This means that for any element `g \\in G \\setminus S`, the new set `S \\cup {g}` is no longer product-free.\n\n*   **Filled Group:** The question states a group `G` is filled if \"all the maximum by inclusion product-free sets in G fills G.\" This is standardly interpreted to mean that the union of all MIPFSs is equal to `G \\setminus \\{e\\}`. Let `\\mathcal{M}(G)` be the collection of all MIPFSs in `G`. Then `G` is filled if:\n    `\\bigcup_{S \\in \\mathcal{M}(G)} S = G \\setminus \\{e\\}`\n    *   **Careful Point:** The union is `G \\setminus \\{e\\}` and not `G`, because `e` can never be in a product-free set. This condition is equivalent to saying that every non-identity element of `G` belongs to at least one MIPFS.\n\n*   **Nilpotent Group:** A finite group `G` is nilpotent if it satisfies a number of equivalent conditions. The most useful for this problem is the structural theorem: a finite group is nilpotent if and only if it is the direct product of its Sylow p-subgroups.\n    *   `G \\cong P_1 \\times P_2 \\times \\dots \\times P_r` where `P_i` are the Sylow `p_i`-subgroups of `G` for distinct primes `p_i`.\n    *   All finite p-groups (groups of order `p^k` for a prime `p`) are nilpotent.\n    *   All finite abelian groups are nilpotent.\n\n### Step 2: Combining the Concepts - Strategy\n\nThe problem asks for groups that are both **finite**, **nilpotent**, and **filled**. Our strategy will be:\n1.  Find a classification of finite filled groups. The classification of filled groups is a non-trivial result from group theory research. Proving it from first principles is extremely difficult, so we will rely on the established classification theorem.\n2.  Take each class of filled groups from the theorem.\n3.  Check which of those groups are also nilpotent.\n\n### Step 3: The Classification of Filled Groups\n\nA full classification of finite filled groups is provided in a paper by E. Crestani, M. Garonzi, and A. Lucchini (2013). Their theorem identifies all such groups. The main families of filled groups are:\n\n1.  **p-groups:** Any finite group of order `p^k` (a p-group) is filled.\n2.  **Certain Soluble Groups of Order `p^a q^b`:** A significant class of filled groups are non-nilpotent semidirect products. For example, a soluble group `G` with `|\\pi(G)|=2` (its order has exactly two distinct prime factors) is filled if and only if it is a specific type of semidirect product `P \\rtimes Q` with a fixed-point-free action.\n3.  **Groups of order 3p:** Groups of order `3p` where `p \\geq 5` is a prime such that `p \\equiv 2 \\pmod 3`.\n4.  **A few other specific groups:** The classification includes a small number of other groups like `S_3 \\times Z_3`, certain semidirect products like `Z_5 \\rtimes Z_4`, and non-abelian simple related groups like `PSL(2,7)` and `M_{10}`.\n\n### Step 4: Finding the Nilpotent Groups within the Filled Classification\n\nNow, we check which of these filled groups are also nilpotent.\n\n1.  **p-groups:** As established in Step 1, all finite p-groups are nilpotent.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This entire family consists of filled nilpotent groups.\n\n2.  **Certain Soluble Groups of Order `p^a q^b`:** The filled groups in this category are characterized as non-trivial semidirect products `G = P \\rtimes_\\phi Q` where the action `\\phi` is non-trivial (specifically, it's a fixed-point-free action). A finite group is nilpotent if and only if its Sylow subgroups are normal, which means any semidirect product structure must be a direct product (i.e., the action `\\phi` is trivial). Since the condition for being filled in this case requires a non-trivial action, these groups are not nilpotent.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This family does not contain any nilpotent groups.\n\n3.  **Groups of order `3p` where `p \\ge 5` is prime and `p \\equiv 2 \\pmod 3`:** Let `G` be a group of order `3p`. By Sylow's theorems:\n    *   The number of Sylow p-subgroups, `n_p`, must divide 3 and `n_p \\equiv 1 \\pmod p`. Since `p \\ge 5`, the only possibility is `n_p = 1`. So, the Sylow p-subgroup is normal.\n    *   The number of Sylow 3-subgroups, `n_3`, must divide `p` and `n_3 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3`. The divisors of `p` are 1 and `p`.\n        *   If `n_3 = p`, then `p \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3`. But the condition is `p \\equiv 2 \\pmod 3`. Therefore, `n_3` cannot be `p`.\n        *   This forces `n_3 = 1`. So, the Sylow 3-subgroup is also normal.\n    Since both Sylow subgroups are normal, `G` must be their direct product: `G \\cong Z_p \\times Z_3 \\cong Z_{3p}`. A cyclic group is abelian, and all abelian groups are nilpotent.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This family consists of the cyclic groups `Z_{3p}` where `p \\ge 5` is prime and `p \\equiv 2 \\pmod 3`. These are all filled nilpotent groups.\n\n4.  **Other specific groups:** The remaining groups listed in the classification are non-abelian groups like `S_3 \\times Z_3` (not nilpotent because `S_3` isn't), `Z_5 \\rtimes Z_4` (a non-trivial semidirect product), `PSL(2,7)` (a simple group), and `M_{10}` (not nilpotent).\n    *   **Conclusion:** None of these are nilpotent.\n\n### Final Answer Synthesis\n\nBy intersecting the set of finite filled groups with the set of finite nilpotent groups, we find two disjoint families of groups:\n\n1.  All finite p-groups.\n2.  All cyclic groups of order `3p`, where `p` is a prime such that `p \\ge 5` and `p \\equiv 2 \\pmod 3`.\n\nThese are the finite filled nilpotent groups.\n\n<<<The finite filled nilpotent groups are the groups that are either (1) a finite p-group for some prime p, or (2) a cyclic group of order 3p, where p is a prime such that p ≥ 5 and p ≡ 2 (mod 3).>>>"
