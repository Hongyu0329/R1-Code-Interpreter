    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the length of the Second Great War in StarCraft lore.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the \"Second Great War\"\nThe first step is to correctly identify the conflict known as the Second Great War. In StarCraft lore, this term refers to the galaxy-wide conflict depicted throughout the events of the *StarCraft II* trilogy, which includes *Wings of Liberty*, *Heart of the Swarm*, and *Legacy of the Void*. This war follows the events of the original *StarCraft* and its expansion *Brood War* (which are collectively known as the First Great War or the Brood War).\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Start Date of the War\nThe Second Great War officially begins with the start of the *StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty* campaign.\n*   **Careful Point:** It is crucial to pinpoint the exact starting event.\n*   **Event:** The war ignites with the renewed large-scale Zerg invasion of the Terran Dominion's fringe worlds.\n*   **Date:** According to the official timeline, this invasion, starting on the planet Mar Sara, takes place in the year **2504**.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the End Date of the War\nThe war's conclusion is marked by the defeat of its primary antagonist, the fallen Xel'naga, Amon.\n*   **Careful Point:** One must distinguish between the end of the main military conflict and the story's final epilogue scene. The war ends when the central threat is neutralized.\n*   **Event:** Amon is ultimately defeated by the united forces of the Terrans, Zerg, and Protoss in the Void. This is depicted in the epilogue campaign of *Legacy of the Void*, titled \"Into the Void\".\n*   **Date:** The reclamation of the Protoss homeworld, Aiur, and the subsequent campaign into the Void to destroy Amon's essence both occur in the year **2506**.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Duration\nWith a start date in 2504 and an end date in 2506, we can calculate the total time elapsed.\n*   **Start:** Year 2504\n*   **End:** Year 2506\n*   The conflict spans a portion of 2504, all of 2505, and a portion of 2506.\n*   **Calculation:** The total duration is more than two full years. For example, a conflict starting in mid-2504 and ending in late-2506 would be approximately 2.5 years long. The exact duration is slightly over 2 years.\n\n### Step 5: Round Up to the Nearest Year\nThe final instruction is to round the duration **up** to the nearest whole year.\n*   **Careful Point:** This is not standard rounding. Any duration that is even slightly over a whole number must be rounded up to the next integer.\n*   **Analysis:** Since the calculated duration is greater than 2 years (e.g., ~2.5 years), we must round this value up.\n*   **Result:** Rounding any value greater than 2.0 up to the nearest year gives us 3.\n\n### Final Answer Acquisition\n1.  War Start: **2504**\n2.  War End: **2506**\n3.  Duration: Takes place over 3 calendar years, with an actual length of just over 2 years.\n4.  Rounding Up: Rounding a value of \"just over 2 years\" up to the nearest whole year results in **3**.\n\n<<<3>>>"
