    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Question**\nThe core task is to compute the determinant of a given 3x3 matrix `A`.\n\\[\nA = \\begin{bmatrix}\n2 & -1 & -1 \\\\\n-1 & 2 & -1 \\\\\n-1 & -1 & 2\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nThe descriptive part of the question, \"the adjacency matrix of the Markov quiver for \\( m_{1/2} = 13 \\)\", provides context but is not necessary for the calculation since the matrix `A` is explicitly stated. The calculation relies solely on the properties and entries of matrix `A`.\n\n**2. List Careful Points**\n*   The matrix is a 3x3 square matrix, so its determinant is well-defined.\n*   The matrix is symmetric (A = Aᵀ).\n*   Observe the structure of the matrix. This is crucial as it might simplify the calculation. Let's inspect the sum of the elements in each row and column.\n    *   Row 1 sum: \\(2 + (-1) + (-1) = 0\\)\n    *   Row 2 sum: \\(-1 + 2 + (-1) = 0\\)\n    *   Row 3 sum: \\(-1 + (-1) + 2 = 0\\)\n*   The fact that all row sums are zero is a significant property.\n\n**3. Method 1: Using Properties of the Matrix**\n\n*   **Linear Dependence:** A fundamental property in linear algebra states that if the sum of the rows of a square matrix results in a zero vector, the rows are linearly dependent.\n    *   Let `R1`, `R2`, and `R3` be the row vectors of matrix A.\n    *   We can see that `R1 + R2 + R3 = [2-1-1, -1+2-1, -1-1+2] = [0, 0, 0]`.\n    *   Since there is a non-trivial linear combination of the rows that equals the zero vector, the rows are linearly dependent.\n*   **Determinant of a Matrix with Linearly Dependent Rows:** A square matrix has a determinant of 0 if and only if its rows (or columns) are linearly dependent.\n*   **Conclusion from Method 1:** Based on this property, the determinant of matrix A must be 0.\n\n*   **Alternative Viewpoint (Eigenvalues):** The fact that the sum of each row is 0 means that the vector \\( \\mathbf{v} = [1, 1, 1]^T \\) is an eigenvector of the matrix `A` with an eigenvalue of 0.\n    *   \\( A\\mathbf{v} = \\begin{bmatrix} 2 & -1 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 2 & -1 \\\\ -1 & -1 & 2 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 2-1-1 \\\\ -1+2-1 \\\\ -1-1+2 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix} = 0 \\cdot \\mathbf{v} \\)\n    *   The determinant of a matrix is the product of its eigenvalues. Since one of the eigenvalues is 0, the product must be 0. Thus, `det(A) = 0`.\n\n**4. Method 2: Direct Calculation (for verification)**\n\n*   **Formula for a 3x3 Determinant:** The determinant of a 3x3 matrix\n    \\[ \\begin{vmatrix} a & b & c \\\\ d & e & f \\\\ g & h & i \\end{vmatrix} = a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg) \\]\n*   **Applying the formula to matrix A:**\n    *   `a = 2`, `b = -1`, `c = -1`\n    *   `d = -1`, `e = 2`, `f = -1`\n    *   `g = -1`, `h = -1`, `i = 2`\n*   **Calculation:**\n    `det(A) = 2 * ((2)(2) - (-1)(-1)) - (-1) * ((-1)(2) - (-1)(-1)) + (-1) * ((-1)(-1) - (2)(-1))`\n    `det(A) = 2 * (4 - 1) + 1 * (-2 - 1) - 1 * (1 - (-2))`\n    `det(A) = 2 * (3) + 1 * (-3) - 1 * (1 + 2)`\n    `det(A) = 6 - 3 - 1 * (3)`\n    `det(A) = 6 - 3 - 3`\n    `det(A) = 0`\n\n**5. Final Conclusion**\nBoth methods—analyzing the matrix properties and direct computation—yield the same result. The determinant of the given matrix is 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
