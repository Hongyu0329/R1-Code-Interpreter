    "Answering the question: Determine \\(av_{333}^3(1324)\\).\n\n**1. Understanding the notation**\n- \\(S_n\\) is the set of permutations of \\(\\{1, 2, ..., n\\}\\).\n- A permutation \\(\\sigma \\in S_n\\) **avoids** the pattern 1324 if there are no indices \\(i < j < k < l\\) such that \\(\\sigma(i) < \\sigma(k) < \\sigma(j) < \\sigma(l)\\).\n- An **inversion** in a permutation \\(\\sigma\\) is a pair of indices \\((i, j)\\) such that \\(i < j\\) and \\(\\sigma(i) > \\sigma(j)\\).\n- \\(av_n^k(\\pi)\\) is the number of permutations of length \\(n\\) that avoid pattern \\(\\pi\\) and have exactly \\(k\\) inversions.\n- We need to find \\(av_{333}^3(1324)\\), which is the number of 1324-avoiding permutations of length \\(n=333\\) with exactly \\(k=3\\) inversions.\n\n**2. Analysis of the 1324-avoidance constraint with a small number of inversions**\n\nThe key insight for permutations with few inversions is that the inversions must be localized to the \"ends\" of the permutation. If an inversion occurs in the \"middle\" of the permutation, it's often easy to form a 1324 pattern.\n\nLet \\(\\sigma\\) be a permutation of \\(\\{1, 2, ..., n\\}\\). Suppose it has an inversion \\((j,k)\\) where \\(j<k\\) and \\(\\sigma(j)>\\sigma(k)\\). For this inversion to form the '32' part of a 1324 pattern, we would need to find indices \\(i < j\\) and \\(l > k\\) such that \\(\\sigma(i) < \\sigma(k) < \\sigma(j) < \\sigma(l)\\).\n\nIf the values \\(\\sigma(i)\\) for \\(i<j\\) are small enough and the values \\(\\sigma(l)\\) for \\(l>k\\) are large enough, a 1324 pattern will exist. For a long permutation like \\(n=333\\), this is almost always possible unless the inversion \\((j,k)\\) is very close to the beginning or the end of the permutation. For example, if \\(j\\) is small (e.g., 1 or 2), finding an \\(i<j\\) is difficult or impossible. If \\(k\\) is large (e.g., \\(n\\) or \\(n-1\\)), finding an \\(l>k\\) is difficult or impossible.\n\nThis suggests that 1324-avoiding permutations with a small number of inversions must have their inversions concentrated at the extremities.\n\n**3. Listing permutations with 3 inversions**\n\nA permutation has 3 inversions if it can be obtained from the identity permutation \\((1, 2, ..., n)\\) by applying a sequence of transpositions that sum to 3 inversions. The basic structures that produce 3 inversions are:\n- A single 3-cycle of values of the form \\((a,b,c) \\to (c,a,b)\\) or \\((a,b,c) \\to (b,c,a)\\). Only certain applications result in exactly 3 inversions. A 3-cycle transposition \\((i, j, k)\\) with values \\((a,b,c)\\) results in 2 or 3 inversions. For instance, swapping values \\(i\\) and \\(j\\) in the identity permutation where \\(j-i>1\\) results in more than 1 inversion.\n- Three separate non-overlapping simple inversions (adjacent swaps).\n- One simple inversion and a structure with 2 inversions, located at disjoint positions.\n\nBased on the principle of keeping inversions at the ends, we can enumerate the possible structures for a large \\(n\\) like 333. Let's list the permutations.\n\nA permutation with 3 inversions that avoids 1324 for large \\(n\\) must have all its inversions occur among the first few elements or the last few elements. Let's analyze the possible distributions of these 3 inversions.\n\nCase 1: All 3 inversions are at the beginning of the permutation.\nThe permutation must start with a permutation of \\(\\{1, 2, 3, 4, ...\\}\\) that has 3 inversions. The smallest set of numbers that can create 3 inversions is \\(\\{1,2,3\\}\\). The permutation \\((3,2,1)\\) has 3 inversions (\\((3,2), (3,1), (2,1)\\)).\n- **Permutation 1**: \\(\\sigma = (3, 2, 1, 4, 5, ..., 333)\\).\n   The inversions are all within the first three positions. An attempt to form a 1324 pattern \\(\\sigma(i) < \\sigma(k) < \\sigma(j) < \\sigma(l)\\) where \\((j,k)\\) is an inversion would require \\(i < j\\). Since the inversions only involve positions \\(\\{1,2,3\\}\\), this means \\(j \\le 2\\), so \\(i=1\\). Any choice of inversion \\((j,k)\\) has \\(\\sigma(j) \\in \\{2,3\\}\\) and \\(\\sigma(1)=3\\). It's not possible to satisfy \\(\\sigma(i)<\\sigma(k)\\). For instance, with inversion \\((j,k)=(2,3)\\), \\(\\sigma(j)=2, \\sigma(k)=1\\). We need \\(\\sigma(i)<1\\), impossible.\n   Thus, this permutation avoids 1324.\n\nCase 2: All 3 inversions are at the end.\nThis is the mirror image of Case 1. The permutation ends with a reversed sequence of the three largest values.\n- **Permutation 2**: \\(\\sigma = (1, 2, ..., 330, 333, 332, 331)\\).\n   Similar to Case 1, any attempt to form a 1324 pattern requires an element \\(\\sigma(l)\\) where \\(l\\) is after the inverted block. This is impossible as the block is at the end. This permutation avoids 1324.\n\nCase 3: The 3 inversions are split between the beginning and the end.\nThe splits can be (2 inversions at the start, 1 at the end) or (1 inversion at the start, 2 at the end).\n\nSubcase 3.1: 2 inversions at the start, 1 at the end.\nA permutation of \\(\\{1,2,3\\}\\) with 2 inversions can be \\((2,3,1)\\) or \\((3,1,2)\\). The single inversion at the end must be \\((..., 333, 332)\\).\n- **Permutation 3**: \\(\\sigma = (2, 3, 1, 4, ..., 332, 333, 332)\\). Correct form: \\(\\sigma = (2, 3, 1, 4, ..., 331, 333, 332)\\).\n   Inversions: \\((2,1), (3,1)\\) at the start, and \\((333,332)\\) at the end. Total 3 inversions.\n   This avoids 1324 because any inversion is too close to an end to form the pattern.\n- **Permutation 4**: \\(\\sigma = (3, 1, 2, 4, ..., 331, 333, 332)\\).\n   Inversions: \\((3,1), (3,2)\\) at the start, and \\((333,332)\\) at the end. Total 3 inversions.\n   This also avoids 1324 for the same reason.\n\nSubcase 3.2: 1 inversion at the start, 2 at the end.\nThese are the \"reverse complement\" reflections of the permutations in subcase 3.1, which preserves the 1324-avoiding property but not necessarily the inversion count. It turns out that for these specific structures, the inversion count is also preserved. The two permutations with 2 inversions at the end are of the form \\((..., 333, 331, 332)\\) and \\((..., 332, 333, 331)\\). Wait, permutations of \\((n-2, n-1, n)\\) that give 2 invs are \\((n, n-2, n-1)\\) and \\((n-1, n, n-2)\\).\nThe single inversion at the start is \\((2,1, ...)\\).\n- **Permutation 5**: \\(\\sigma = (2, 1, 3, ..., 330, 333, 331, 332)\\). (1 inversion from \\((2,1)\\) + 2 inversions from \\((...,333,331,332)\\))\n   This avoids 1324.\n- **Permutation 6**: \\(\\sigma = (2, 1, 3, ..., 330, 332, 333, 331)\\). No, \\((..., n-1, n, n-2)\\) form. The values are permuted. The permutation would end in \\((..., 332, 333, 331)\\) with respect to values \\(331, 332, 333\\). \\(\\sigma_{331} = 331, \\sigma_{332} = 333, \\sigma_{333}=332\\) would mean the permutation is \\((1,2,...,330,331,333,332)\\), which has 1 inversion. This is not the structure.\nLet's construct it correctly. The ending sequence should be a permutation of \\({331, 332, 333}\\) on positions \\({331, 332, 333}\\).\nPermutations of \\((331, 332, 333)\\) with 2 inversions are \\((332, 333, 331)\\) and \\((333, 331, 332)\\).\nThe beginning is \\((2,1,3,...)\\).\n- Permutation 5 (re-stated): \\(\\sigma = (2, 1, 3, ..., 330, 332, 333, 331)\\) gives \\((2,1)\\) plus \\((332,331), (333,331)\\). Total 3 invs. Avoids 1324.\n- Permutation 6 (re-stated): \\(\\sigma = (2, 1, 3, ..., 330, 333, 331, 332)\\). This is the permutation from my reasoning for Permutation 5. Total 3 invs. Avoids 1324.\n\nLet's recheck all candidates carefully. The set of permutations with inversions split between the start and end is: {2-inv start} \\(\\times\\) {1-inv end} and {1-inv start} \\(\\times\\) {2-inv end}.\n- Structures with 2 invs at start: \\((2,3,1,...)\\), \\((3,1,2,...)\\)\n- Structures with 1 inv at start: \\((2,1,3,...)\\)\n- Structures with 2 invs at end: \\((...,n,n-2,n-1)\\), \\((...,n-1,n,n-2)\\). Not quite. The values permuted are n,n-1,n-2. The structure is \\((...333,331,332)\\) and \\((...332,333,331)\\).\n- Structures with 1 inv at end: \\((...,n,n-1)\\)\n\nSo combinations:\n- \\((2,3,1, ..., 333, 332)\\) (This is my Permutation 3)\n- \\((3,1,2, ..., 333, 332)\\) (This is my Permutation 4)\n- \\((2,1,3, ..., 333, 331, 332)\\) (This is one version of Permutation 5/6)\n- \\((2,1,3, ..., 332, 333, 331)\\) (The other version of Permutation 5/6)\n\nIn total we have:\n1. One block of 3 inversions at the start: \\((3,2,1,...)\\)\n2. One block of 3 inversions at the end: \\((...,333,332,331)\\)\n3. Two inversions at the start \\((2,3,1,...)\\) and one at the end \\((...,333,332)\\).\n4. Two inversions at the start \\((3,1,2,...)\\) and one at the end \\((...,333,332)\\).\n5. One inversion at the start \\((2,1,...)\\) and two at the end \\((...,333,331,332)\\).\n6. One inversion at the start \\((2,1,...)\\) and two at the end \\((...,332,333,331)\\).\n\nAny other structure, such as splitting the three inversions into three separate adjacent swaps \\((2,1)\\), \\((..., i+1, i, ...)\\), \\((..., 333, 332)\\), would have the middle inversion create a 1324 pattern. For instance, in \\(\\sigma=(2,1,3,4,6,5,7,...)\\), the inversion from \\((6,5)\\) at positions (5,6) creates a 1324 pattern with \\(\\sigma(1)=2\\) and \\(\\sigma(7)=7\\): \\(\\sigma(1) < \\sigma(6) < \\sigma(5) < \\sigma(7) \\Rightarrow 2<5<6<7\\).\n\nThere are exactly these 6 types of permutations for large \\(n\\).\n\n**Final Count**\n1. \\((3,2,1,4,...,333)\\)\n2. \\((1,2,...,330,333,332,331)\\)\n3. \\((2,3,1,4,...,331,333,332)\\)\n4. \\((3,1,2,4,...,331,333,332)\\)\n5. \\((2,1,3,...,330,333,331,332)\\)\n6. \\((2,1,3,...,330,332,333,331)\\)\n\nThese are 6 distinct permutations of length 333 with 3 inversions that avoid the pattern 1324. Therefore, \\(av_{333}^3(1324) = 6\\).\n\nFinal answer is 6.\n\nFinal check of the reasoning.\nThe core assumption is that for k=3 and n=333, any 1324-avoiding permutation must have its inversions localized at the ends. An inversion \\((j, k)\\) with \\(\\sigma(j) > \\sigma(k)\\) will create a 1324 pattern if we can find \\(i<j\\) and \\(l>k\\) such that \\(\\sigma(i) < \\sigma(k)\\) and \\(\\sigma(l) > \\sigma(j)\\). With \\(n=333\\), unless \\(j,k\\) are near 1 or 333, we can almost certainly find an untouched small value \\(\\sigma(i)=i\\) at the beginning and an untouched large value \\(\\sigma(l)=l\\) at the end to form the pattern. This justifies localizing the inversions. The enumeration of structures with 3 inversions localized at the ends results in 6 permutations. The analysis seems sound.\n\nFinal list of 6 permutations:\n1. Block of 3 invs at start: `(3, 2, 1, ...)`\n2. Block of 3 invs at end: `(..., n, n-1, n-2)`\n3. Block of 2 invs at start, 1 at end: `(2, 3, 1, ..., n, n-1)`\n4. Block of 2 invs at start, 1 at end: `(3, 1, 2, ..., n, n-1)`\n5. Block of 1 inv at start, 2 at end: `(2, 1, ..., n, n-2, n-1)`\n6. Block of 1 inv at start, 2 at end: `(2, 1, ..., n-1, n, n-2)` (mistake here, must be permutation of n-2,n-1,n).\nCorrecting the last two: The two permutations of \\((n-2,n-1,n)\\) with 2 inversions are \\((n-1, n, n-2)\\) and \\((n, n-2, n-1)\\).\nSo my perms are:\n5. \\((2,1,3,.., n-3, n-1,n,n-2)\\)\n6. \\((2,1,3,.., n-3, n,n-2,n-1)\\)\nYes, this confirms the count of 6 distinct structures.\n\n<<<6>>>"
