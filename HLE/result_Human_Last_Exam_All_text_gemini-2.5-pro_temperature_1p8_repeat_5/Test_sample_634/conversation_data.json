    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of the given polynomial matrices.\n\n**1. Understand the Problem and Definitions**\n\nWe need to find the Greatest Common Right Divisor (GCRD) of two polynomial matrices:\n*   $P_1(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} s^2 + s & -s \\\\ -s^2 - 1 & s^2 \\end{bmatrix}$\n*   $P_2(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} s & 0 \\\\ -s - 1 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}$\n\n**Key Concepts:**\n*   A polynomial matrix D(s) is a **right divisor** of P(s) if there exists a polynomial matrix Q(s) such that P(s) = Q(s)D(s).\n*   A matrix G(s) is a **GCRD** of P1(s) and P2(s) if it is a common right divisor of both, and any other common right divisor D(s) is also a right divisor of G(s).\n*   The GCRD is not unique; it is determined up to left multiplication by a **unimodular matrix** (a square polynomial matrix whose determinant is a non-zero constant).\n\n**2. Method: Euclidean Algorithm for Polynomial Matrices**\n\nThe most common method is to use elementary row operations to find the GCRD. We form a stacked matrix M(s) and reduce it.\n$M(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} P_1(s) \\\\ P_2(s) \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} s^2+s & -s \\\\ -s^2-1 & s^2 \\\\ s & 0 \\\\ -s-1 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}$\n\nOur goal is to apply elementary row operations (swapping rows, multiplying a row by a non-zero constant, or adding a polynomial multiple of one row to another) to transform M(s) into the form $\\begin{bmatrix} G(s) \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}$, where G(s) is a 2x2 matrix and 0 is the 2x2 zero matrix. The resulting G(s) will be a GCRD of P1(s) and P2(s).\n\n**3. Step-by-Step Row Reduction**\n\nLet's denote the rows of M(s) as R1, R2, R3, and R4.\n$R_1: [s^2 + s, -s]$\n$R_2: [-s^2 - 1, s^2]$\n$R_3: [s, 0]$\n$R_4: [-s - 1, 1]$\n\n**Step 3.1:** Use the rows with lower-degree polynomials (R3 and R4) to simplify the higher-degree rows (R1 and R2). We'll use R3 to eliminate the first element of R1.\n*   Perform the operation `R1' = R1 - (s+1)R3`:\n    $R_1' = [s^2 + s, -s] - (s+1)[s, 0] = [s^2 + s - (s^2+s), -s] = [0, -s]$\n\n**Step 3.2:** Use R3 to simplify R2. The polynomial multiplier must have a degree less than or equal to `deg(R2)-deg(R3)`.  Wait, let's use the result from Step 3.1. Or just continue with the original matrix. Let's simplify R2 using R3.\n*   Perform the operation `R2' = R2 + (s)R3`:\n    $R_2' = [-s^2-1, s^2] + s[s, 0] = [-s^2-1+s^2, s^2] = [-1, s^2]$\n\nNow our system is represented by the rows (let's reorder for clarity):\n$R_2': [-1, s^2]$\n$R_4: [-s-1, 1]$\n$R_1': [0, -s]$\n$R_3: [s, 0]$\n\n**Step 3.3:** Use the new simpler rows to eliminate the others. Let's use `R2' = [-1, s^2]` to eliminate the first elements of R4 and R3.\n*   Perform the operation `R4' = R4 - (s+1)R2'`:\n    $R_4' = [-s-1, 1] - (s+1)[-1, s^2] = [-s-1 - (-s-1), 1 - (s+1)s^2] = [0, 1 - s^3 - s^2]$\n*   Perform the operation `R3' = R3 + sR2'`:\n    $R_3' = [s, 0] + s[-1, s^2] = [s-s, s^3] = [0, s^3]$\n\nNow the matrix is equivalent to the row-space basis:\n$[-1, s^2]$\n$[0, -s]$\n$[0, s^3]$\n$[0, 1 - s^3 - s^2]$\n\n**Step 3.4:** We now have three rows with zero in the first column. We can use the simplest of these, `[0, -s]`, to simplify the other two.\n*   Perform the operation `R3'' = R3' + s^2 * [0, -s]`:\n    $R_3'' = [0, s^3] + s^2[0, -s] = [0, s^3-s^3] = [0, 0]$ (We have found our first zero row).\n*   To simplify `[0, 1 - s^3 - s^2]`, let's first add `R3'` to it: `[0, 1 - s^3 - s^2] + [0, s^3] = [0, 1-s^2]`. Let this be `R_A = [0, 1-s^2]`.\n\nOur set of non-zero rows is now equivalent to:\n$B_1: [-1, s^2]$\n$B_2: [0, -s]$\n$B_3: [0, 1 - s^2]$\n\n**Step 3.5:** Use polynomial division on the second elements of B2 and B3. We divide `1-s^2` by `-s`: `1 - s^2 = s(-s) + 1`. The remainder is 1. This means we can find a linear combination to get a row `[0, 1]`.\n*   Perform the operation `B3' = B3 - s * B2`:\n    $B_3' = [0, 1 - s^2] - s[0, -s] = [0, 1-s^2+s^2] = [0, 1]$\n\nOur current basis for the GCRD is:\n$B_1: [-1, s^2]$\n$B_3': [0, 1]$\n\n**Step 3.6:** Use the very simple row `B3' = [0, 1]` to simplify `B1`.\n*   Perform the operation `B1' = B1 - s^2 * B3'`:\n    $B_1' = [-1, s^2] - s^2[0, 1] = [-1, s^2 - s^2] = [-1, 0]$\n\n**4. Final Result**\n\nWe have reduced the original four rows to a basis of two non-zero rows, while the other two have become zero rows. The final two rows that form the GCRD are:\n$G_1 = [-1, 0]$\n$G_2 = [0, 1]$\n\nWe can write the GCRD matrix by combining these rows:\n$G(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} -1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}$\n\n**5. Verification**\n\nLet's check if this result is unimodular.\ndet(G(s)) = (-1)(1) - (0)(0) = -1.\nSince the determinant is a non-zero constant, G(s) is a unimodular matrix.\n\nWhen the GCRD is a unimodular matrix, it means the original matrices P1(s) and P2(s) are **right coprime**. Any unimodular matrix is a valid GCRD in this case. Common choices include the one found by the algorithm or the identity matrix I. The identity matrix can be obtained from our result by left-multiplying by $\\begin{bmatrix} -1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}$.\n\nThe matrix we found is a perfectly valid GCRD.\n\n<<<\n[[-1, 0], [0, 1]]\n>>>"
