    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Properties\n\nThe question asks for crystal classes that satisfy three conditions:\n1.  **Achiral**: The crystal structure is superimposable on its mirror image. In terms of symmetry elements, this means the crystal class must possess at least one symmetry operation of the second kind, which includes a center of inversion (`i` or `-1`), a mirror plane (`m`), or a rotoinversion axis (`-n`).\n2.  **Non-polar**: A crystal class is non-polar if it does not have a unique polar axis. A polar axis is a direction in the crystal that is not related to its opposite direction by any symmetry operation. A crystal with a polar axis exhibits pyroelectricity. There are 10 polar crystal classes: 1, 2, m, mm2, 3, 3m, 4, 4mm, and 6, 6mm. Any class not on this list is non-polar.\n3.  **Optically Active**: A crystal is optically active if it can rotate the plane of polarized light. The essential symmetry requirement for this property is the absence of a center of symmetry (inversion center, `-1`). Therefore, all 21 non-centrosymmetric crystal classes have the correct symmetry to be optically active. This property is described by the gyration tensor, `g_ij`, which must be non-zero.\n\n### Step 2: Identify Candidate Crystal Classes\n\nWe need to find the intersection of these three properties. We start with the broadest set and apply the filters.\n\n1.  **Start with the 21 non-centrosymmetric crystal classes** (the ones that can be optically active):\n    1, 2, m, 222, mm2, 4, -4, 422, 4mm, -42m, 3, 32, 3m, 6, -6, 622, 6mm, -62m, 23, 432, -43m.\n\n2.  **Filter for Achiral classes**: We need to select the classes from the list above that have a mirror plane (`m`) or a rotoinversion axis (`-n`).\n    *   Chiral classes (to be excluded): 1, 2, 222, 3, 32, 4, 422, 6, 622, 23, 432.\n    *   Achiral non-centrosymmetric classes (the remainder): **m, mm2, -4, 4mm, -42m, 3m, -6, 6mm, -6m2, -43m**. There are 10 such classes.\n\n3.  **Filter for Non-polar classes**: Now we take our list of 10 achiral, non-centrosymmetric classes and remove the ones that are polar.\n    *   The 10 polar classes are: 1, 2, **m**, **mm2**, 3, **3m**, 4, **4mm**, 6, **6mm**.\n    *   Removing the polar classes from our list of 10 leaves us with the following:\n        *   `m` is polar -> remove.\n        *   `mm2` is polar -> remove.\n        *   `-4` is non-polar -> **keep**.\n        *   `4mm` is polar -> remove.\n        *   `-42m` is non-polar -> **keep**.\n        *   `3m` is polar -> remove.\n        *   `-6` is non-polar -> **keep**.\n        *   `6mm` is polar -> remove.\n        *   `-62m` is non-polar -> **keep**.\n        *   `-43m` is non-polar -> **keep**.\n\n    The final set of crystal classes that are achiral, non-polar, and optically active (non-centrosymmetric) is: **{-4, -42m, -6, -62m, -43m}**.\n\n    *Careful Point*: There is a known controversy in some textbooks regarding whether classes with a horizontal mirror plane (-6 and -6m2) can be truly optically active. Some sources state their gyration tensor is zero. However, the most general condition for allowing optical activity is non-centrosymmetry, which all 5 of these classes satisfy. For the purpose of answering a multiple-choice question, we assume the broadest definition that allows all 5 classes.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate the Answer Choices\n\nNow we compare our derived list of 5 classes with the given options.\nOur list: **{-4, -42m, -6, -6m2, -43m}**\n\n*   **A. m and mm2**: These are achiral but are polar. Incorrect.\n*   **B. -6, -62m, and -43m**: All three of these classes are in our derived list. This is a possible correct answer.\n*   **C. 3m, 4m, and 6mm**: These are achiral (assuming 4m is a typo for 4mm) but are polar. Incorrect.\n*   **D. -4 and -42m**: Both of these classes are in our derived list. This is also a possible correct answer.\n*   **E. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6**: These classes are chiral. Incorrect.\n\nWe are left with two choices, B and D, both of which are subsets of the correct answer set. In a well-formed question, there should be a reason to prefer one over the other. Let's look for a distinguishing feature or a hidden grouping principle.\n\n### Step 4: Find the Distinguishing Feature\n\nLet's check for a common symmetry element in the classes of option B that is not present in option D. A key symmetry element in crystallography is the 3-fold rotation axis, which is required for the trigonal, hexagonal, and cubic crystal systems.\n\n*   Classes in Option B: {-6, -6m2, -43m}\n    *   **-6**: Belongs to the hexagonal system. It has a 3-fold rotation axis as a subgroup of the -6 rotoinversion axis.\n    *   **-62m**: Belongs to the hexagonal system. It has a 3-fold rotation axis as a subgroup of the -6 rotoinversion axis.\n    *   **-43m**: Belongs to the cubic system. It has four 3-fold rotation axes.\n    *   *All classes in option B possess at least one 3-fold rotation axis.*\n\n*   Classes in Option D: {-4, -42m}\n    *   **-4**: Belongs to the tetragonal system. Its highest axis order is 4. It does not have a 3-fold axis.\n    *   **-42m**: Belongs to the tetragonal system. Its highest axis order is 4. It does not have a 3-fold axis.\n    *   *Neither class in option D possesses a 3-fold rotation axis.*\n\nThis provides a clear criterion for separating the classes. The set of {achiral, non-polar, optically active} classes that also possess a 3-fold axis is precisely {-6, -6m2, -43m}. It is plausible that this was the intended grouping for the question.\n\n<<<B>>>"
