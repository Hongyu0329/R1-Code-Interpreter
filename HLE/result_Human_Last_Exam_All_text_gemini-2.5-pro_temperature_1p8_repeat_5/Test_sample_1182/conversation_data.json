    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of double points on the stable reduction of the curve $y^2 = 8x + x^2 + 4x^3 + 4x^4 + 8x^5$ above the prime $p=2$.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the initial reduction modulo 2**\n\nThe given curve is $C: y^2 = 8x + x^2 + 4x^3 + 4x^4 + 8x^5$. We consider this curve over the ring of 2-adic integers $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ (or its localization at (2), $\\mathbb{Z}_{(2)}$). To find the reduction modulo 2, we reduce the coefficients of the equation modulo 2.\n$8 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2}$\n$1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$\n$4 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2}$\n$8 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2}$\n\nThe equation of the special fiber $C_2$ over the field $\\mathbb{F}_2$ is:\n$y^2 \\equiv x^2 \\pmod{2}$\nThis can be rewritten as $y^2 - x^2 \\equiv 0$, which factors as $(y-x)(y+x) \\equiv 0$. In $\\mathbb{F}_2$, since $1=-1$, this is equivalent to $(y-x)^2 \\equiv 0$.\nThis is the equation of a \"double line\" $y=x$. The scheme is non-reduced and every point on the line is singular. This is not a stable curve, indicating that the initial model has \"bad reduction\".\n\n**Step 2: Find a better model**\n\nTo find the stable reduction, we need to find a new model of the curve, birationally equivalent to the original one over $\\mathbb{Q}$, which has a better reduction property. The fact that the singular line is $y=x$ suggests a change of coordinates centered around this line.\n\nLet's rearrange the original equation:\n$y^2 - x^2 = 8x + 4x^3 + 4x^4 + 8x^5$\n$(y-x)(y+x) = 4(2x + x^3 + x^4 + 2x^5)$\n\nThe right-hand side is divisible by 4. This suggests that the quantities $(y-x)$ and $(y+x)$ carry factors of 2.\nSince $y^2 \\equiv x^2 \\pmod 2$, for any point $(x,y)$ on the curve over $\\mathbb{Z}_2$, we have $y \\equiv x \\pmod 2$.\nThis implies that $v_2(y-x) \\ge 1$.\nAlso, $y+x = (y-x) + 2x$, so $v_2(y+x) \\ge \\min(v_2(y-x), v_2(2x)) \\ge 1$.\nSo both $(y-x)$ and $(y+x)$ are divisible by 2.\n\nThis motivates the change of variables. Let's introduce a new variable $y_1 = \\frac{y-x}{2}$. Let's also set $x_1=x$. We now derive the equation for the curve in terms of $x_1$ and $y_1$.\nFrom the new variables, we have $y = 2y_1 + x = 2y_1 + x_1$.\nSubstitute this into the original equation:\n$(2y_1 + x_1)^2 = 8x_1 + x_1^2 + 4x_1^3 + 4x_1^4 + 8x_1^5$\n$4y_1^2 + 4x_1y_1 + x_1^2 = 8x_1 + x_1^2 + 4x_1^3 + 4x_1^4 + 8x_1^5$\n$4y_1^2 + 4x_1y_1 = 8x_1 + 4x_1^3 + 4x_1^4 + 8x_1^5$\nNow, we can divide the entire equation by 4. All coefficients are integers, so this defines a valid model over $\\mathbb{Z}_{(2)}$ (or $\\mathbb{Z}_2$).\n$y_1^2 + x_1y_1 = 2x_1 + x_1^3 + x_1^4 + 2x_1^5$\n\nThis new model, let's call it $C'$, is birationally equivalent to $C$.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the reduction of the new model**\n\nNow we reduce the equation for $C'$ modulo 2.\n$y_1^2 + x_1y_1 \\equiv 0 \\cdot x_1 + x_1^3 + x_1^4 + 0 \\cdot x_1^5 \\pmod 2$\nThe special fiber $C'_2$ is given by the equation:\n$y_1^2 + x_1y_1 + x_1^3 + x_1^4 = 0$\nThis equation can be written as $y_1(y_1+x_1) = x_1^3(x_1+1)$.\n\n**Step 4: Check if the new special fiber is stable**\n\nA stable curve is a reduced curve whose only singularities are ordinary double points (nodes).\nFirst, let's check for singularities on $C'_2$. A point $(x_1, y_1)$ is singular if the partial derivatives vanish. Let $F(x_1, y_1) = y_1^2 + x_1y_1 + x_1^3 + x_1^4$.\n$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y_1} = 2y_1 + x_1 \\equiv x_1 \\pmod 2$\n$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x_1} = y_1 + 3x_1^2 + 4x_1^3 \\equiv y_1 + x_1^2 \\pmod 2$\nFor a singularity, we must have $x_1 = 0$. Substituting this into the second equation gives $y_1 + 0^2 = 0$, so $y_1=0$.\nThe only singular point is $(0,0)$. Let's check if it's on the curve: $F(0,0) = 0+0+0+0=0$. Yes.\n\nNext, we determine the type of the singularity at $(0,0)$. We look at the lowest degree terms of $F(x_1, y_1)$, which form the tangent cone at the origin.\nLowest degree terms: $y_1^2 + x_1y_1 = y_1(y_1+x_1)$.\nThe equation for the tangent cone is $y_1(y_1+x_1)=0$. This represents two distinct lines through the origin, $y_1=0$ and $y_1=x_1$.\nSince there are two distinct tangents, the singularity at $(0,0)$ is an ordinary double point (a node).\n\nThe curve $C'_2$ is also irreducible (it cannot be factored into simpler polynomials over the algebraic closure of $\\mathbb{F}_2$). An irreducible curve with only nodes as singularities is a stable curve. The genus of the original curve is $g = \\lfloor(5-1)/2\\rfloor = 2$. The geometric genus of the nodal curve $C'_2$ (which is a plane quartic with one node) is $p_a - \\delta = \\frac{(4-1)(4-2)}{2} - 1 = 3-1=2$. The genus is correct.\n\nSince we have found a model $C'$ whose special fiber $C'_2$ is a stable curve, $C'_2$ is the stable reduction of the original curve $C$.\n\n**Step 5: Count the double points**\n\nThe question asks for the number of double points on the stable reduction. From our analysis in Step 4, the stable reduction is the curve $C'_2$, and it has exactly one singular point, which is a double point (a node).\n\nTherefore, the number of double points is 1."
