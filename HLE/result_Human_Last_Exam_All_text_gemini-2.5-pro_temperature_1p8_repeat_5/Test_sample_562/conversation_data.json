    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the radical of the character 謄.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the character**\nThe character 謄 can be broken down into two components arranged left to right:\n*   Left component: 月\n*   Right component: 朕\n\n**Step 2: Identify the radical position**\nIn kanji with a left-right structure (known as a 偏旁, *henbō* structure), the left-hand component, the 偏 (*hen*), is typically the radical that determines the character's classification in a dictionary. Therefore, the radical of 謄 is 月.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the meaning and name of the radical**\nThis is a crucial point. The component 月 can represent two different radicals:\n1.  **月 (tsuki)**: Meaning \"moon\". When it's a radical on the left side, it is called *tsukihen* (つきへん).\n2.  **肉 (niku)**: Meaning \"meat\" or \"flesh\". When this radical appears on the left side of a character, it is also written as 月. This form has its own specific name to distinguish it from the \"moon\" radical.\n\nTo figure out which radical it is, we often need to check a dictionary or consider the character's semantic group. While the meaning of 謄, \"to copy,\" doesn't seem related to \"flesh,\" kanji dictionaries classify it under the 肉 (niku) radical based on its etymology.\n\n**Step 4: Find the specific name of the radical form**\nThe radical 肉 (niku) when written as 月 on the left side is called にくづき (*nikuzuki*). This name literally means \"meat-moon.\" This specific name is used precisely to avoid confusion with the actual moon radical, *tsukihen*.\n\n**Step 5: Convert the name to Hepburn transcription**\nThe Japanese name for the radical, にくづき, is written in Hepburn romanization as **nikuzuki**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe character is 謄. Its radical is the left-side component 月. This component represents the radical for \"flesh\" (肉), not \"moon\". The specific name for this radical form is にくづき, which is \"nikuzuki\" in Hepburn romanization.\n\n<<<nikuzuki>>>"
