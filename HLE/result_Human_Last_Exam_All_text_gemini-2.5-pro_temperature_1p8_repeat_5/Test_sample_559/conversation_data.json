    "An analysis of the system of differential equations is performed step-by-step to identify the separatrix.\n\n**1. Identify the system and region of interest**\nThe system of differential equations is:\n$d'(t) = 2d^2(t) + (5u^2(t) - 3u(t))d(t) - u(t)(1 - u(t))u^2(t)$\n$u'(t) = (u(t) - 1)u^2(t)$\n\nLet's rewrite this for simplicity as:\n$d' = 2d^2 + (5u^2 - 3u)d + u^3(u - 1)$\n$u' = u^2(u - 1)$\n\nThe analysis is restricted to the upper half-plane, $u \\geq 0$.\n\n**2. Find the equilibrium points**\nEquilibrium points are where $d' = 0$ and $u' = 0$.\nFrom $u' = u^2(u - 1) = 0$, we find $u=0$ or $u=1$.\n\n*   If $u=0$, substituting into $d'=0$:\n    $2d^2 + 0 \\cdot d + 0 = 0 \\Rightarrow 2d^2 = 0 \\Rightarrow d = 0$.\n    So, one equilibrium point is $(0, 0)$.\n\n*   If $u=1$, substituting into $d'=0$:\n    $2d^2 + (5(1)^2 - 3(1))d + 1^3(1 - 1) = 0$\n    $2d^2 + 2d = 0 \\Rightarrow 2d(d+1) = 0 \\Rightarrow d=0$ or $d=-1$.\n    So, two other equilibrium points are $(0, 1)$ and $(-1, 1)$.\n\nThe equilibrium points in the region $u \\geq 0$ are $(0, 0)$, $(0, 1)$, and $(-1, 1)$.\n\n**3. Classify the equilibrium points**\nWe analyze the stability by computing the Jacobian matrix $J(d, u) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\partial d'/\\partial d & \\partial d'/\\partial u \\\\ \\partial u'/\\partial d & \\partial u'/\\partial u \\end{pmatrix}$.\n$\\partial d'/\\partial d = 4d + 5u^2 - 3u$\n$\\partial d'/\\partial u = (10u - 3)d - 3u^2 + 4u^3$\n$\\partial u'/\\partial d = 0$\n$\\partial u'/\\partial u = 3u^2 - 2u$\n\n*   At $(0, 1)$: $J(0, 1) = \\begin{pmatrix} 5-3 & -3+4 \\\\ 0 & 3-2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$. Eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1=2, \\lambda_2=1$. Since both are positive, $(0, 1)$ is an unstable node (a source).\n\n*   At $(-1, 1)$: $J(-1, 1) = \\begin{pmatrix} 4(-1)+5-3 & (10-3)(-1)-3+4 \\\\ 0 & 3-2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -2 & -6 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$. Eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1=-2, \\lambda_2=1$. Since one is positive and one is negative, $(-1, 1)$ is a saddle point.\n\n*   At $(0, 0)$: $J(0, 0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$. Linearization is inconclusive. This is a degenerate equilibrium point.\n\n**4. Find the equation for phase-plane trajectories**\nThe trajectories in the $(u, d)$ phase plane are described by the differential equation $\\frac{dd}{du} = \\frac{d'}{u'}$.\n$$ \\frac{dd}{du} = \\frac{2d^2 + (5u^2 - 3u)d + u^3(u - 1)}{u^2(u - 1)} $$\nThis is a Riccati differential equation, which is generally difficult to solve. However, we can look for a simple particular solution, such as a polynomial. Let's try to find an invariant curve of the form $d = f(u)$.\n\n**5. Search for a particular solution (invariant curve)**\nLet's test if a solution of the form $d = au^2 + bu + c$ exists. Substituting this into the ODE would be tedious. Instead, we can substitute it into the original system, noting that if $d(t) = f(u(t))$, then $d'(t) = f'(u(t)) u'(t)$.\n$f'(u)u' = 2(f(u))^2 + (5u^2-3u)f(u) + u^3(u-1)$\n$(2au+b)(u^3-u^2) = 2(au^2+bu+c)^2 + (5u^2-3u)(au^2+bu+c) + u^3(u-1)$.\nExpanding both sides and comparing coefficients of powers of $u$ leads to a system of equations for $a, b, c$.\nThis analysis shows that $a=-1, b=0, c=0$ is a valid solution.\nThus, we have found a particular solution:\n$d = -u^2$\n\n**6. Verify the solution**\nLet's check if $d = -u^2$ satisfies the phase-plane ODE.\nIf $d = -u^2$, then $\\frac{dd}{du} = -2u$.\nSubstitute $d = -u^2$ into the right-hand side of the ODE:\n$$ \\frac{2(-u^2)^2 + (5u^2 - 3u)(-u^2) + u^3(u - 1)}{u^2(u - 1)} = \\frac{2u^4 - 5u^4 + 3u^3 + u^4 - u^3}{u^2(u-1)} $$\n$$ = \\frac{-2u^4 + 2u^3}{u^2(u - 1)} = \\frac{-2u^3(u - 1)}{u^2(u - 1)} = -2u $$\nSince the left-hand side equals the right-hand side, $d = -u^2$ is indeed an invariant curve, representing a trajectory of the system.\n\n**7. Identify the separatrix**\nA separatrix is a trajectory that separates regions of the phase plane with different long-term behavior. The stable and unstable manifolds of a saddle point are always separatrices.\n\nOur invariant curve $d = -u^2$ passes through the following equilibrium points:\n*   If $u=0$, $d=0$, so it passes through $(0, 0)$.\n*   If $u=1$, $d=-1^2=-1$, so it passes through the saddle point $(-1, 1)$.\n\nSince the curve $d=-u^2$ passes through the saddle point $(-1,1)$, it must be part of either the stable or unstable manifold of this saddle point. Therefore, the curve defined by $d = -u^2$ is a separatrix.\n\nLet's determine the direction of flow on this separatrix. For $0 < u < 1$, we have $u' = u^2(u-1) < 0$. This means that $u$ decreases with time. Consequently, a point on the curve $d = -u^2$ moves from $u=1$ to $u=0$. The trajectory starts at the saddle point $(-1, 1)$ and ends at the equilibrium point $(0, 0)$. This identifies the curve as part of the unstable manifold of the saddle point.\n\nThe question asks for the separatrix of the system. The explicit analytical curve we have found, $d = -u^2$, is a key separatrix that governs the system's dynamics."
