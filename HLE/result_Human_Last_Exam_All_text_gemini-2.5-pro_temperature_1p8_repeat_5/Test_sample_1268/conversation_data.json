    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Question**\n\nThe question asks for an upper bound on a quantity denoted by $(k_{k,\\infty})$, in relation to the covolume $(V)$, specifically for congruence subgroups associated with squarefree natural numbers $(N)$.\n\n*   **Object of Interest:** A quantity denoted as $(k_{k,\\infty})$.\n*   **Domain:** Automorphic forms for congruence subgroups $\\Gamma_0(N)$ where $N$ is a squarefree natural number. A squarefree number is a positive integer not divisible by any perfect square other than 1 (e.g., 6=2x3, 10=2x5, but not 12=2²x3).\n*   **Independent Variable:** The covolume $V = \\text{Vol}(\\Gamma_0(N)\\backslash\\mathbb{H})$, which is the volume of the fundamental domain of the modular surface.\n*   **Task:** Find a function $g(V)$ such that $k_{k,\\infty} \\le g(V)$.\n\n**2. Interpret the Notation**\n\n*   **Covolume (V):** For the congruence subgroup $\\Gamma_0(N)$, the covolume of the quotient space $\\Gamma_0(N)\\backslash\\mathbb{H}$ (where $\\mathbb{H}$ is the Poincaré upper half-plane) is given by the formula:\n    $V = \\text{Vol}(\\Gamma_0(N)\\backslash\\mathbb{H}) = [\\text{PSL}_2(\\mathbb{Z}) : \\overline{\\Gamma_0(N)}] \\cdot \\frac{\\pi}{3}$.\n    The index for $N > 2$ is $[\\text{PSL}_2(\\mathbb{Z}) : \\overline{\\Gamma_0(N)}] = N \\prod_{p|N} (1 + 1/p)$.\n    Since $N$ is squarefree, $N\\prod_{p|N} (1 + 1/p) = \\sigma(N)$, the sum of divisors of $N$. So, $V = \\frac{\\pi}{3}\\sigma(N)$.\n    Asymptotically, for large $N$, we have the relation $V \\asymp N \\log\\log N$. This means $N \\asymp V / \\log\\log V$.\n\n*   **Maximum Norm $(k_{k,\\infty})$:** This notation is not standard. However, in the context of automorphic forms, \"maximum norm\" or \"sup-norm\" is a very common object of study. The notation most likely refers to the $L^\\infty$-norm of an $L^2$-normalized Hecke eigenform.\n    *   If we consider a **holomorphic cusp form** $f$ of weight $k$, the standard sup-norm is $\\|f\\|_\\infty = \\sup_{z \\in \\mathbb{H}} y^{k/2}|f(z)|$. The notation $k_{k,\\infty}$ is a plausible, if unusual, way to denote this quantity, where the first subscript $k$ signifies the weight.\n    *   If we consider a **Maass cusp form** $\\phi$, the sup-norm is $\\|\\phi\\|_\\infty = \\sup_{z \\in \\mathbb{H}} |\\phi(z)|$.\n    The forms are assumed to be $L^2$-normalized, i.e., $\\|f\\|_2 = 1$ or $\\|\\phi\\|_2 = 1$. The problem is typically studied for newforms, which form a canonical basis for the space of newforms.\n\n**3. Identify the Relevant Mathematical Result**\n\nThe problem of finding bounds for the sup-norm of automorphic forms is a central area of research in modern analytic number theory. The bounds depend critically on the properties of the underlying group. The specific condition that **$N$ is squarefree** is a major hint, as it simplifies the arithmetic structure and allows for stronger results than in the general case.\n\n*   **Classical and General Bounds:** Earlier general bounds for the sup-norm on an arithmetic surface of volume $V$ were of the form $V^{1/4}$ or $V^{1/6}$. For example, a result by Iwaniec and Sarnak (1995) gives a bound of $\\ll V^{1/6+\\epsilon}$ for congruence subgroups.\n\n*   **State-of-the-Art Bound for Squarefree N:** The sharpest known bounds for the case of squarefree level $N$ are a significant improvement. They are major results, building on the proof of the Quantum Unique Ergodicity (QUE) conjecture in the level aspect.\n    *   For **holomorphic newforms** $f$ of fixed weight $k$ for $\\Gamma_0(N)$ with $N$ squarefree, a result by N. Templier (and others) establishes the bound:\n        $\\|f\\|_\\infty \\ll_{k, \\epsilon} N^{-1/12 + \\epsilon}$ for any $\\epsilon > 0$.\n    *   For **Hecke-Maass newforms** $\\phi$ of fixed spectral parameter $t$ for $\\Gamma_0(N)$ with $N$ squarefree, a result by V. Blomer and R. Holowinsky establishes the same bound:\n        $\\|\\phi\\|_\\infty \\ll_{t, \\epsilon} N^{-1/12 + \\epsilon}$ for any $\\epsilon > 0$.\n\nSince the bound has the same form in both the holomorphic and Maass cases, the ambiguity in interpreting $k_{k,\\infty}$ does not affect the final answer in terms of its dependence on the level/volume. The negative exponent implies that the maximum value of these normalized forms actually *decreases* as the level $N$ (and thus the volume $V$) increases.\n\n**4. Express the Bound in Terms of the Covolume V**\n\nThe final step is to translate the bound from being a function of $N$ to being a function of $V$.\n\n1.  The bound is $\\ll N^{-1/12 + \\epsilon}$.\n2.  The relation between $V$ and $N$ for squarefree $N$ is $N \\asymp V / \\log\\log V$.\n3.  Substituting this relation into the bound:\n    $N^{-1/12 + \\epsilon} \\asymp (V / \\log\\log V)^{-1/12 + \\epsilon} = V^{-1/12 + \\epsilon} \\cdot (\\log\\log V)^{1/12 - \\epsilon}$.\n4.  The term $(\\log\\log V)^{1/12 - \\epsilon}$ grows much more slowly than any positive power of $V$. In asymptotic notation, for any $\\delta > 0$, $(\\log x)^c \\ll x^\\delta$. Therefore, this term can be absorbed into the $V^\\epsilon$ factor by choosing a slightly larger $\\epsilon$. For instance, $(\\log\\log V)^{1/12-\\epsilon} \\ll_{\\epsilon'} V^{\\epsilon'}$ for any $\\epsilon'>0$.\n5.  Thus, the upper bound, when expressed in terms of the covolume $V$, is:\n    $k_{k,\\infty} \\ll_{k, \\epsilon} V^{-1/12 + \\epsilon}$.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   The notation $k_{k,\\infty}$ is non-standard and requires a careful interpretation based on context. The sup-norm of an $L^2$-normalized Hecke eigenform is the most reasonable choice.\n*   The result is an asymptotic upper bound, denoted by $\\ll$ or $O(\\cdot)$. It holds for large $N$ (and $V$).\n*   The implied constant in the bound depends on the weight $k$ (or spectral parameter $t$) and the choice of $\\epsilon$.\n*   The squarefree condition on $N$ is essential for this particularly strong bound. For general $N$, the bounds are weaker.\n*   The conversion from $N$ to $V$ introduces logarithmic factors which are then absorbed into the arbitrary $V^\\epsilon$ term.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the analysis, the upper bound is derived from the state-of-the-art results on sup-norms of automorphic forms for congruence subgroups with a squarefree level.\n\n$O(V^{-1/12 + \\epsilon})$\n\nThis indicates that the maximum norm is bounded above by a constant times $V^{-1/12 + \\epsilon}$, where $\\epsilon$ is any arbitrarily small positive number.\n\n<<<O(V^{-1/12 + \\epsilon})>>>"
