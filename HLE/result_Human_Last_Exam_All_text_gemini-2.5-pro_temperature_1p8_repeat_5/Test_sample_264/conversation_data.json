    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### **Analysis of the Question**\n\nThe problem asks for the volume of the intersection of two identical cubes of side length 1, where one is shifted relative to the other.\n\n*   **Step 1: Understand the geometry.** We have two cubes, each with side length 1. Let's call them Cube A and Cube B.\n*   **Step 2: Understand the transformation.** One cube is shifted relative to the other. The shift is \"by 1/2 along the main diagonal.\"\n*   **Step 3: Define the problem mathematically.** We need to represent the cubes and the shift in a coordinate system to calculate the volume of their common region.\n*   **Step 4: Calculate the volume.** Once the intersection region is defined, we calculate its volume.\n\n### **Careful Points to Consider**\n\n1.  **Interpretation of the \"shift\"**: This is the most crucial part of the problem. The phrase \"shifted by 1/2 along the main diagonal\" can be interpreted in two ways:\n    *   **Interpretation A (Component-wise shift):** The shift components along each axis are 1/2. If the main diagonal is represented by the vector (1, 1, 1), the shift vector is (1/2, 1/2, 1/2). This is a common convention in geometry problems of this nature because it preserves the simplicity of the coordinates.\n    *   **Interpretation B (Magnitude of shift):** The actual distance of the shift is 1/2. The shift vector would be **v** = (1/2) * **u**, where **u** is the unit vector in the direction of the main diagonal. This would result in a shift vector of (1/(2√3), 1/(2√3), 1/(2√3)).\n    We will proceed with **Interpretation A** as it is the more standard and intended reading for this type of problem.\n\n2.  **Choice of Main Diagonal**: A cube has four main diagonals. Due to the symmetry of the cube, the volume of the intersection will be the same regardless of which main diagonal is chosen for the shift. We will choose the diagonal connecting (0, 0, 0) to (1, 1, 1).\n\n3.  **Coordinate System**: We need to place the cubes in a 3D Cartesian coordinate system. A convenient setup is to place one corner of the first cube at the origin.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Solution**\n\n**Step 1: Define the first cube (Cube A).**\nLet's place Cube A in the first octant of a 3D coordinate system, with one vertex at the origin (0, 0, 0). As its side length is 1, Cube A occupies the region defined by:\n`0 ≤ x ≤ 1`\n`0 ≤ y ≤ 1`\n`0 ≤ z ≤ 1`\n\n**Step 2: Define the shift and the second cube (Cube B).**\nThe main diagonal connects opposite vertices, such as (0, 0, 0) and (1, 1, 1). The vector along this diagonal is **d** = (1, 1, 1).\nBased on our chosen interpretation (Interpretation A), a shift \"by 1/2 along the main diagonal\" corresponds to a shift vector **v** = (1/2, 1/2, 1/2).\nCube B is the result of shifting Cube A by this vector **v**. Therefore, Cube B occupies the region defined by adding 1/2 to the bounds of Cube A:\n`0 + 1/2 ≤ x ≤ 1 + 1/2`  =>  `1/2 ≤ x ≤ 3/2`\n`0 + 1/2 ≤ y ≤ 1 + 1/2`  =>  `1/2 ≤ y ≤ 3/2`\n`0 + 1/2 ≤ z ≤ 1 + 1/2`  =>  `1/2 ≤ z ≤ 3/2`\n\n**Step 3: Determine the region of intersection.**\nThe intersection is the volume where a point (x, y, z) belongs to both Cube A and Cube B. This means its coordinates must satisfy both sets of inequalities.\n*   **For x:** The point must satisfy `0 ≤ x ≤ 1` AND `1/2 ≤ x ≤ 3/2`. The overlapping interval is `[max(0, 1/2), min(1, 3/2)]` which is `1/2 ≤ x ≤ 1`.\n*   **For y:** The point must satisfy `0 ≤ y ≤ 1` AND `1/2 ≤ y ≤ 3/2`. The overlapping interval is `[max(0, 1/2), min(1, 3/2)]` which is `1/2 ≤ y ≤ 1`.\n*   **For z:** The point must satisfy `0 ≤ z ≤ 1` AND `1/2 ≤ z ≤ 3/2`. The overlapping interval is `[max(0, 1/2), min(1, 3/2)]` which is `1/2 ≤ z ≤ 1`.\n\nThe intersection is a rectangular prism (specifically, a smaller cube) defined by these new bounds.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the volume of the intersection.**\nThe volume of this intersection shape is the product of the lengths of its sides.\n*   Length in x-direction: `1 - 1/2 = 1/2`\n*   Length in y-direction: `1 - 1/2 = 1/2`\n*   Length in z-direction: `1 - 1/2 = 1/2`\n\nThe volume `V` is:\n`V = (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/8`\n\nVisually, the corner of the shifted cube B located at (1/2, 1/2, 1/2) is exactly at the center of the original cube A. The intersection is the octant of Cube A that lies between its center and the corner at (1, 1, 1). This is a smaller cube with side length 1/2.\n\nFinal Answer: The volume of the intersection is 1/8.\n\n<<<1/8>>>"
