The best replacement would be to mutate all four amino acids—Serine (S) at 47, Glutamate (E) at 48, Glutamate (E) at 49, and Aspartate (D) at 50—to Alanine (A). This creates a quadruple mutant (S47A/E48A/E49A/D50A), changing the sequence from SEED to AAAA. This approach effectively removes the negative charges from the acidic residues and, crucially, eliminates the phosphorylation site at Serine 47, preventing the addition of a strong negative charge. Alanine is ideal because it is small, chemically inert, and uncharged, which allows for testing the role of the original side chains' charges with minimal risk of introducing new, confounding structural changes or interactions.
