    "An internal adjunction in a 2-category is a generalization of the concept of an adjoint pair of functors. When the 2-category is locally posetal, like the simplex category $\\Delta$ viewed as a subcategory of $\\mathsf{Pos}$, the definition simplifies considerably.\n\n### Step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Understanding the context:**\n    *   The simplex category $\\Delta$ has objects $[n] = \\{0, 1, \\dots, n\\}$ for non-negative integers $n$.\n    *   Morphisms $f: [m] \\to [n]$ are order-preserving functions, meaning if $i \\le j$ in $[m]$, then $f(i) \\le f(j)$ in $[n]$.\n    *   $\\Delta$ is considered a *locally posetal 2-subcategory of $\\mathsf{Pos}$*. This means for any two objects $[m], [n]$, the set of morphisms $\\hom([m], [n])$ is a poset. The order relation is given by $f \\le g$ if and only if $f(i) \\le g(i)$ for all $i \\in [m]$. The 2-morphisms are these relations.\n\n2.  **Definition of an internal adjunction:**\n    *   An internal adjunction from an object $X$ to an object $Y$ in a 2-category consists of a pair of morphisms (called 1-morphisms) $f: X \\to Y$ (the left adjoint) and $g: Y \\to X$ (the right adjoint), along with two 2-morphisms: the unit $\\eta: \\mathrm{id}_X \\Rightarrow g \\circ f$ and the counit $\\varepsilon: f \\circ g \\Rightarrow \\mathrm{id}_Y$, which must satisfy the triangle identities.\n    *   In a locally posetal category like $\\Delta$, the 2-morphisms are simply inequalities.\n        *   The unit $\\eta$ corresponds to the relation $\\mathrm{id}_{[m]} \\le g \\circ f$, which means $i \\le g(f(i))$ for all $i \\in [m]$.\n        *   The counit $\\varepsilon$ corresponds to the relation $f \\circ g \\le \\mathrm{id}_{[n]}$, which means $f(g(j)) \\le j$ for all $j \\in [n]$.\n    *   In a poset, the triangle identities are automatically satisfied. Therefore, an adjunction from $[m]$ to $[n]$ is a pair of order-preserving maps $(f, g)$ satisfying these two inequalities.\n\n3.  **The Adjunction Condition:**\n    *   The pair of inequalities $i \\le g(f(i))$ and $f(g(j)) \\le j$ is equivalent to the more common definition of a Galois connection (or adjunction between posets):\n        For all $i \\in [m]$ and $j \\in [n]$, $f(i) \\le j \\iff i \\le g(j)$.\n    *   We are looking for the number of such pairs $(f, g)$ for $m=23$ and $n=37$.\n\n4.  **Counting Adjunctions by counting Adjoints:**\n    *   An adjunction is uniquely determined by either its left adjoint or its right adjoint.\n    *   Let's find the conditions for an order-preserving map $f: [m] \\to [n]$ to be a left adjoint. It must have a right adjoint $g$. The map $g$ would be defined by $g(j) = \\max\\{i \\in [m] \\mid f(i) \\le j\\}$. For this to be well-defined for all $j \\in [n]$, the set must not be empty. For $j=0$, we require the set $\\{i \\in [m] \\mid f(i) \\le 0\\}$ to be non-empty. This means there is some $i$ with $f(i)=0$. As $f$ is order-preserving, this forces $f(0)=0$. If $f(0)=0$, the set is non-empty for all $j \\in [n]$, and $g$ is well-defined.\n    *   Conversely, any order-preserving map $f: [m] \\to [n]$ with $f(0)=0$ has a unique right adjoint $g$, and together they form an adjunction. So, the number of adjunctions is the number of such maps $f$.\n    *   Similarly, we can characterize right adjoints. For an order-preserving map $g: [n] \\to [m]$ to be a right adjoint, it must have a left adjoint $f$. The map $f$ would be defined by $f(i) = \\min\\{j \\in [n] \\mid i \\le g(j)\\}$. For this to be well-defined for all $i \\in [m]$, the set must be non-empty. For $i=m$, we need $\\{j \\in [n] \\mid m \\le g(j)\\}$ to be non-empty. This requires the maximum value of $g$ to be at least $m$. Since the codomain of $g$ is $[m]$, this maximum value is at most $m$, and is achieved at $g(n)$. Thus we must have $g(n)=m$.\n    *   So, the number of adjunctions is also the number of order-preserving maps $g: [n] \\to [m]$ such that $g(n)=m$.\n\n5.  **The Combinatorial Calculation:**\n    *   We need to find the number of internal adjunctions from $[23]$ to $[37]$. So, $m=23$ and $n=37$.\n    *   We can count the number of left adjoints: order-preserving maps $f: [23] \\to [37]$ with $f(0)=0$.\n        *   An order-preserving map is defined by a non-decreasing sequence of values $f(0), f(1), \\dots, f(23)$.\n        *   $f(0)=0$ is fixed. We need to choose the values $f(1), \\dots, f(23)$ such that $0 \\le f(1) \\le f(2) \\le \\dots \\le f(23) \\le 37$.\n        *   This is equivalent to choosing an order-preserving map from $\\{1, \\dots, 23\\}$ (a chain of 23 elements, isomorphic to $[22]$) to $[37]$.\n        *   The number of order-preserving maps from $[N]$ to $[M]$ is given by the stars-and-bars formula $\\binom{M+N+1}{N+1}$.\n        *   Here, $N=22$ and $M=37$. The number is $\\binom{37+22+1}{22+1} = \\binom{60}{23}$.\n\n6.  **Verification:**\n    *   Alternatively, we count the right adjoints: order-preserving maps $g: [37] \\to [23]$ with $g(37)=23$.\n        *   This is defined by a sequence $g(0) \\le g(1) \\le \\dots \\le g(36) \\le g(37)=23$.\n        *   This is equivalent to choosing an order-preserving map from $[36]$ to $[23]$.\n        *   Here, $N=36$ and $M=23$. The number is $\\binom{23+36+1}{36+1} = \\binom{60}{37}$.\n    *   Since $\\binom{60}{23} = \\frac{60!}{23!37!}$ and $\\binom{60}{37} = \\frac{60!}{37!23!}$, the two calculations yield the same result, confirming our reasoning.\n\nThe number of internal adjunctions is the value of this binomial coefficient."
