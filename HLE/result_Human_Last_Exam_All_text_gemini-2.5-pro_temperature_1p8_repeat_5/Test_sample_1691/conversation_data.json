    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to develop the analytical formula for the integral $I(\\epsilon)$ in the small $\\epsilon$ regime.\n\n**1. Analyze the Integral and Integrand**\n\nThe integral is given by:\n$I(\\epsilon) = \\int_0^{15.00} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9.0 x^{5.0} + 5.0 x^{6.0} + 9.0 x^{8.0}} dx$\n\nLet the denominator be $D(x, \\epsilon) = \\epsilon + P(x)$, where $P(x) = 9x^5 + 5x^6 + 9x^8$. The parameter $\\epsilon$ is small and positive ($\\epsilon \\to 0^+$).\n\n**2. Identify the Dominant Contribution Region**\n\nAs $\\epsilon \\to 0^+$, the term $\\epsilon$ in the denominator becomes negligible except where $P(x)$ is also very small. Let's analyze the behavior of $P(x)$ on the integration interval $[0, 15]$.\n*   $P(x) = x^5(9 + 5x + 9x^3)$.\n*   At $x=0$, $P(0) = 0$.\n*   For any $x > 0$, $P(x) > 0$.\n\nThe denominator $D(x, \\epsilon)$ approaches zero as $\\epsilon \\to 0$ and $x \\to 0$. This causes the integrand to become very large in a small region around $x=0$. This phenomenon indicates that the main contribution to the value of the integral for small $\\epsilon$ comes from this region. This is a classic singular perturbation problem.\n\n**3. Approximate the Integrand for Small x**\n\nFor $x$ close to zero (the inner region), the polynomial $P(x)$ can be approximated by its term with the lowest power of $x$:\n$P(x) = 9x^5 + 5x^6 + 9x^8 \\approx 9x^5$ for small $x$.\n\nThe higher-order terms ($5x^6$, $9x^8$) are negligible compared to $9x^5$ when $x$ is small.\n\n**4. Formulate the Approximate Integral**\n\nBased on the observations above, we can approximate the integral by:\n1.  Replacing $P(x)$ with its leading-order term for small $x$, which is $9x^5$.\n2.  Extending the upper limit of integration from $15$ to $\\infty$. This is justified because the contribution from the region where $x$ is large becomes insignificant as $\\epsilon \\to 0$. For any fixed $x > 0$, the integrand $\\frac{1}{\\epsilon+P(x)}$ goes to $\\frac{1}{P(x)}$, while for $x$ close to zero, it blows up. The dominant behavior is captured by the singularity at $x=0$. The error introduced by extending the limit is of a lower order in $\\epsilon$ than the leading term.\n\nSo, the approximate integral is:\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9x^5} dx$\n\n**5. Evaluate the Approximate Integral**\n\nWe can solve this integral using a scaling substitution. Let's introduce a new variable $u$ such that the two terms in the denominator become of the same order. Let:\n$9x^5 = \\epsilon u \\implies x^5 = \\frac{\\epsilon u}{9} \\implies x = \\left(\\frac{\\epsilon}{9}\\right)^{1/5} u^{1/5}$\n\nNow, we find the differential $dx$:\n$dx = \\left(\\frac{\\epsilon}{9}\\right)^{1/5} \\frac{1}{5} u^{-4/5} du$\n\nSubstitute these into the approximate integral. The integration limits for $u$ are from $0$ to $\\infty$ as well.\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + \\epsilon u} \\left(\\frac{\\epsilon}{9}\\right)^{1/5} \\frac{1}{5} u^{-4/5} du$\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon(1+u)} \\frac{1}{5} \\left(\\frac{\\epsilon}{9}\\right)^{1/5} u^{-4/5} du$\n\nNow, factor out the terms involving $\\epsilon$:\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\frac{\\epsilon^{1/5}}{\\epsilon} \\frac{1}{5 \\cdot 9^{1/5}} \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{u^{-4/5}}{1+u} du$\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\frac{1}{5 \\cdot 9^{1/5}} \\epsilon^{-4/5} \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{u^{-4/5}}{1+u} du$\n\n**6. Calculate the Definite Integral**\n\nThe remaining integral is a standard form related to the Beta function:\n$\\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{t^{p-1}}{1+t} dt = \\Gamma(p)\\Gamma(1-p) = \\frac{\\pi}{\\sin(p\\pi)}$\n\nIn our case, $p-1 = -4/5$, so $p = 1/5$. The value of the integral is:\n$\\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{u^{-4/5}}{1+u} du = \\frac{\\pi}{\\sin(\\pi/5)}$\n\n**7. Final Analytical Formula**\n\nSubstitute the value of the definite integral back into our expression for $I(\\epsilon)$:\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\frac{1}{5 \\cdot 9^{1/5}} \\epsilon^{-4/5} \\frac{\\pi}{\\sin(\\pi/5)}$\n\nThis can be written more cleanly as:\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\frac{\\pi}{5 \\cdot 9^{1/5} \\sin(\\pi/5)} \\epsilon^{-4/5}$\n\nThis is the analytical formula that approximates $I(\\epsilon)$ for small $\\epsilon$. The formula captures the leading-order singular behavior of the integral. The exponent $-4/5$ comes from the dominant power $x^5$ in the denominator, specifically as $1/p - 1 = 1/5 - 1 = -4/5$. The coefficient depends on the coefficient of this term ($9.0$) and the power itself.\n\nThe terms we neglected ($5x^6$, $9x^8$, and the finite upper limit of 15) contribute to higher-order terms in the asymptotic expansion (e.g., terms proportional to $\\epsilon^{-3/5}$, $\\epsilon^{-2/5}$, etc.), which are smaller than the leading term for small $\\epsilon$.\n\nFinal Answer formulation: Let $C = \\frac{\\pi}{5 \\cdot 9^{1/5} \\sin(\\pi/5)}$. The formula is $I(\\epsilon) \\approx C \\epsilon^{-4/5}$.\n\n<<<$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\frac{\\pi}{5 \\cdot 9^{1/5} \\sin(\\pi/5)} \\epsilon^{-4/5}$>>>"
