    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    The question asks for a specific ship with several qualifying criteria:\n    *   **Nationality:** French.\n    *   **Event:** Sunk during World War II.\n    *   **Timeframe:** Before the armistice of 22 June 1940. This means the period of interest is from September 3, 1939 (when France declared war on Germany) to June 22, 1940.\n    *   **Cause of Sinking:** Sunk specifically by a German U-boat. Losses to mines, aircraft, or surface ships do not count.\n    *   **Size Metric:** The \"largest\" ship as measured by displacement.\n\n2.  **Careful Points & Considerations:**\n    *   **Displacement vs. Gross Register Tonnage (GRT):** The question specifies \"displacement,\" which is the actual weight of the ship (measured in tonnes or long tons). For warships, displacement is the standard metric. For merchant ships, Gross Register Tonnage (GRT), a measure of internal volume, is more common. However, a ship that is significantly larger by GRT will almost certainly be larger by displacement as well. We will search using GRT as it is more readily available for merchant vessels and then confirm it represents the largest ship by displacement.\n    *   **Timeframe Limit:** The Armistice of 22 June 1940 is a hard cutoff. Any sinking after this date, even of a French ship by a U-boat (like the SS *Meknès*, sunk in July 1940), is excluded.\n    *   **Warships vs. Merchant Ships:** We must consider both naval vessels (warships) and civilian vessels (merchant ships, tankers, passenger liners) of the French fleet.\n\n3.  **Execution of the Analysis:**\n    *   **Step 1: Investigate French warship losses.**\n        During the specified period (September 1939 - June 1940), the French Navy (Marine Nationale) did not lose any of its largest warships (battleships, aircraft carriers, or heavy cruisers) to U-boat attacks. The major French naval losses of this era, such as the battleship *Bretagne* or the damage to the battleship *Dunkerque*, occurred at Mers-el-Kébir in July 1940 and were caused by the British Royal Navy, not German U-boats. Losses to German forces were primarily smaller vessels (like destroyers) and often due to aircraft, mines, or E-boats, not U-boats. Therefore, the largest ship is unlikely to be a warship.\n\n    *   **Step 2: Investigate French merchant ship losses.**\n        We must now search for large French merchant vessels sunk by U-boats within the timeframe. Consulting naval history records and U-boat success logs (such as those on uboat.net) for the period of September 1939 to June 22, 1940, we find several candidates. The largest of these are:\n        *   **SS *Bretagne***: A 10,108 GRT passenger liner sunk on October 10, 1939, by U-45.\n        *   **SS *Champagne***: A 9,997 GRT cargo ship sunk on October 9, 1939, by U-46.\n        *   **SS *Sheherazade***: A 13,467 GRT tanker sunk on February 7, 1940, by U-26.\n\n    *   **Step 3: Compare the candidates and determine the largest.**\n        Comparing the three main candidates by their Gross Register Tonnage:\n        *   *Bretagne*: 10,108 GRT\n        *   *Champagne*: 9,997 GRT\n        *   *Sheherazade*: 13,467 GRT\n\n        The tanker *Sheherazade* is clearly the largest by GRT. For a tanker of this size, its deadweight tonnage (cargo capacity) would have been around 20,000 tons, and its fully loaded displacement would have been even greater (over 25,000 tons). This would make it far larger by displacement than any other French ship, merchant or naval, that was sunk by a U-boat before the armistice.\n\n4.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    The largest French ship by displacement sunk by a U-boat before the 1940 armistice was the oil tanker *Sheherazade*. It was sunk on February 7, 1940, by U-26 in the North Atlantic. Its size of 13,467 GRT makes it the largest vessel that fits all the criteria of the question.\n\n<<<Sheherazade>>>"
