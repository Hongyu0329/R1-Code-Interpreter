    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Modern English word \"sister\" and its origin.\n\nThe current word in Modern English is \"sister\". A common assumption might be that this word evolved directly from its Old English predecessor. However, etymological sources show this is incorrect. The word \"sister\" is actually a loanword from Old Norse.\n\n*   **Modern English:** sister\n*   **Source:** Old Norse *systir*\n*   **Proto-Germanic Root:** \\**swestēr*\n\nThe Old Norse word *systir* became dominant in English, especially in the northern parts of England (the Danelaw) where Norse influence was strongest. Over time, it displaced the native English form in the standard language.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the native Old English word for \"sister\".\n\nBefore the Norse influence became widespread, the Anglo-Saxons had their own word for a female sibling. This word was cognate with (related to) the Old Norse word, as both descend from the same Proto-Germanic root.\n\n*   **Old English:** *sweostor* (with variants like *swuster*)\n*   **Proto-Germanic Root:** \\**swestēr*\n\nThe core of the question is to determine what *sweostor* would have become in Modern English if it had not been replaced by the Norse *systir*.\n\n### Step 3: Trace the likely linguistic evolution of the Old English word *sweostor*.\n\nTo predict its modern form, we can follow its development into Middle English and then apply the same sound changes that affected similar words.\n\n1.  **Old English to Middle English:** The Old English *sweostor* evolved into the Middle English form *suster*. This involved the simplification of the initial *sw-* cluster before the back vowel and a change in the final vowel. The form *suster* was widely used in Middle English literature, for example, by Chaucer. It was the common form until the Norse-derived \"sister\" gradually took over.\n\n2.  **Middle English to Modern English:** We can predict the evolution of Middle English *suster* by looking at comparable words that did follow the native evolutionary path, such as *mother* and *brother*.\n    *   Old English *mōdor* -> Middle English *moder* -> Modern English *mother*\n    *   Old English *brōþor* -> Middle English *brother* -> Modern English *brother*\n\n    In these words, the stressed 'o' vowel of Middle English, pronounced /oː/ or /ɔː/, became the /ʌ/ sound (the STRUT vowel, as in \"cup\" or \"strut\") in Modern English. Similarly, the 'u' sound in Middle English *suster* (pronounced roughly as /u/ in \"put\") would have also developed into this /ʌ/ sound. This is a regular sound change known as the \"STRUT-vowel split\".\n\n    *   Middle English *suster* (pronounced /ˈsustər/) -> Modern English **\"suster\"** (pronounced /ˈsʌstər/)\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\n\nIf the Norse had never invaded and introduced their word *systir*, the native Old English word *sweostor* would have continued its natural development. It became *suster* in Middle English, and following the standard phonetic shifts into Modern English (parallel to words like *mother* and *brother*), it would have become the Modern English word **\"suster\"**.\n\n<<<suster>>>"
