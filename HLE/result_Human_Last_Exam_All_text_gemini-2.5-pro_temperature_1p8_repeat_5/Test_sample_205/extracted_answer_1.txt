/*
 * Program to calculate 100! on the Wuxing computer.
 *
 * Analysis for Minimal Memory Usage:
 * 1. The value of 100! has 158 decimal digits, which is too large for
 *    any standard data type. An array of digits must be used.
 * 2. `digit result[158];` is the most memory-efficient structure.
 *    Memory cost: 158 digits * 1D/digit = 158D.
 * 3. All other helper variables (loop counters, carry, product) are small
 *    enough to be held in the Wuxing computer's 10 registers (specifically
 *    the 6 general-purpose ones). An optimizing compiler would do this to
 *    achieve maximum performance and minimum memory footprint.
 * 4. Therefore, the only memory allocated for variables is for the result array.
 *    Total minimum memory for variables = 158D.

void main() {
    // === Variable Declaration ===
    // This array stores the digits of 100! in reverse order. It is the
    // only variable that requires data memory allocation.
    digit result[158]; // Consumes 158D of stack memory.

    // Helper variables. These would be mapped to registers by an
    // optimizing compiler, consuming 0D of stack memory.
    char i;          // Outer loop counter (2 to 100). `char` (3D) is sufficient.
    char j;          // Inner loop digit-counter. `char` (3D) is sufficient.
    char num_digits; // Tracks the current number of digits in the result.
    char carry;      // Holds the carry-over value during multiplication.
    int product;     // Stores intermediate products, requires a 4D `int`.

    // === Initialization ===
    // Initialize the result to 1.
    // The number is stored as {1}, so it has 1 digit.
    num_digits = 1;
    result[0] = 1;

    // Zero out the rest of the array for clean state.
    for (j = 1; j < 158; j++) {
        result[j] = 0;
    }

    // === Main Calculation Loop: Multiply by i from 2 to 100 ===
    for (i = 2; i <= 100; i++) {
        carry = 0;
        // For each `i`, multiply it with the large number stored in `result`.
        for (j = 0; j < num_digits; j++) {
            // Standard grade-school multiplication algorithm.
            product = result[j] * i + carry;
            result[j] = product % 10;  // The new digit is the remainder.
            carry = product / 10;      // The new carry is the quotient.
        }

        // After the loop, if a carry remains, append it to the number.
        while (carry > 0) {
            result[num_digits] = carry % 10;
            num_digits = num_digits + 1;
            carry = carry / 10;
        }
    }

    // === Output the Result ===
    // The program would now print the contents of `result`.
    // The digits are stored in reverse, so we print from the end.
    // The C-style loop condition `j >= 0` works because `j` is a signed char.
    // But to be fully compliant and explicit with unsigned-like types:
    // for (j = num_digits; j > 0; j--) {
    //     printf("%d", result[j-1]);
    // }
    // Printing from `num_digits - 1` down to 0:
    printf("100! = ");
    for (j = num_digits - 1; ; j--) {
        printf("%d", result[j]);
        if (j == 0) {
             break;
        }
    }
    printf("\n");
