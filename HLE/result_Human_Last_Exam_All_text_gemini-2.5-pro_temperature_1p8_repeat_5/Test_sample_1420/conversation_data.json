    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of how to determine the scaling exponent $\\alpha$ for the specific heat using the epsilon expansion.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Framework**\n\n*   **Renormalization Group (RG) Theory:** This is a theoretical framework in physics used to study systems at different length scales. In statistical mechanics, it is fundamental for understanding critical phenomena (phase transitions).\n*   **Scaling Exponents:** Near a critical point, various physical quantities exhibit power-law behavior. The exponents in these power laws are called critical exponents. The specific heat at constant volume, $C_V$, scales with the reduced temperature $t = (T-T_c)/T_c$ as $C_V \\sim |t|^{-\\alpha}$. The exponent $\\alpha$ is what we need to find.\n*   **Upper Critical Dimension ($d_c$):** For a given physical system, there exists an upper critical dimension $d_c$. For dimensions $d > d_c$, fluctuations are not significant, and mean-field theory accurately predicts the critical exponents. For $d < d_c$, fluctuations are dominant, and RG methods are needed. For the class of models this question implicitly refers to (the Ising/O(n) models), the upper critical dimension is $d_c=4$.\n*   **Epsilon ($\\epsilon$) Expansion:** This is a perturbative RG technique developed by Wilson and Fisher. It calculates critical exponents as a power series in the small parameter $\\epsilon = d_c - d$. This allows for systematic calculations of exponents in dimensions just below $d_c$.\n\n**Step 2: Define Parameters for the Specific Problem**\n\n*   **Spatial Dimension (d):** The problem states $d=3$.\n*   **Upper Critical Dimension ($d_c$):** As mentioned, for the standard model of ferromagnetism (the Ising model and its generalizations, the O(n) models), $d_c=4$.\n*   **Epsilon ($\\epsilon$):** We calculate $\\epsilon$ as the deviation from the upper critical dimension:\n    $\\epsilon = d_c - d = 4 - 3 = 1$.\n\n**Careful Point 1:** The $\\epsilon$-expansion is formally valid for $\\epsilon \\ll 1$. Applying it for $d=3$ means we set $\\epsilon=1$, which is not a small parameter. However, this extrapolation often provides surprisingly good first approximations for the exponents and is a standard procedure in introductory treatments.\n\n**Step 3: Use the Hyperscaling Relation**\n\nOne of the key results of RG is the validation of scaling relations between different critical exponents. The relevant relation here is the hyperscaling relation that connects the specific heat exponent $\\alpha$, the correlation length exponent $\\nu$, and the spatial dimension $d$:\n\n$2 - \\alpha = d\\nu$\n\nFrom this, we can express $\\alpha$ as:\n\n$\\alpha = 2 - d\\nu$\n\n**Careful Point 2:** This relation is only valid for $d < d_c$. Above $d_c$, in mean-field theory, the exponents are $\\alpha_{MFT}=0$ and $\\nu_{MFT}=1/2$, and the relation $2-0 \\neq d(1/2)$ is violated for $d > 4$.\n\n**Step 4: Find the Expression for the Exponent $\\nu$ from the $\\epsilon$-Expansion**\n\nThe correlation length exponent $\\nu$ has a well-known $\\epsilon$-expansion for the O(n) model (where 'n' is the number of components of the order parameter). To first order in $\\epsilon$, this is:\n\n$\\nu = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{n+2}{4(n+8)}\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n\n*   For the **Ising model** (the most common case, representing uniaxial magnets), we have $n=1$.\n*   For the **XY model** (superfluids), we have $n=2$.\n*   For the **Heisenberg model** (isotropic magnets), we have $n=3$.\n\n**Careful Point 3:** The question does not specify 'n'. By default in such problems, the Ising model (n=1) is assumed unless stated otherwise. We will proceed with n=1.\n\n**Step 5: Derive the Expression for $\\alpha$ using the $\\epsilon$-Expansion**\n\nNow we substitute the expression for $\\nu$ and $d=4-\\epsilon$ into the hyperscaling relation for $\\alpha$:\n\n$\\alpha = 2 - (4-\\epsilon)\\nu$\n$\\alpha = 2 - (4-\\epsilon)\\left[ \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{n+2}{4(n+8)}\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2) \\right]$\n\nLet's expand this, keeping only terms up to the first order in $\\epsilon$:\n\n$\\alpha = 2 - \\left[ (4 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}) + (4 \\cdot \\frac{n+2}{4(n+8)}\\epsilon) - (\\epsilon \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}) + O(\\epsilon^2) \\right]$\n$\\alpha = 2 - \\left[ 2 + \\frac{n+2}{n+8}\\epsilon - \\frac{1}{2}\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2) \\right]$\n$\\alpha = - \\left( \\frac{n+2}{n+8} - \\frac{1}{2} \\right)\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n\nNow, find a common denominator for the terms in the parenthesis:\n\n$\\alpha = - \\left( \\frac{2(n+2) - 1(n+8)}{2(n+8)} \\right)\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n$\\alpha = - \\left( \\frac{2n+4-n-8}{2(n+8)} \\right)\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n$\\alpha = - \\left( \\frac{n-4}{2(n+8)} \\right)\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n\n$\\alpha = \\frac{4-n}{2(n+8)}\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n\nThis is the general first-order expression for $\\alpha$ in the O(n) model.\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the Final Answer**\n\nWe now substitute the specific values for our problem: $n=1$ (Ising model) and $\\epsilon=1$ (for d=3).\n\n$\\alpha \\approx \\frac{4-1}{2(1+8)} \\times 1$\n$\\alpha \\approx \\frac{3}{2(9)}$\n$\\alpha \\approx \\frac{3}{18}$\n$\\alpha \\approx \\frac{1}{6}$\n\nThus, the first-order $\\epsilon$-expansion estimates the specific heat exponent in $d=3$ to be 1/6.\n\n---\nFinal Answer Acquisition:\n- The problem asks for the specific heat exponent, $\\alpha$.\n- The context is RG theory, specifically the $\\epsilon$-expansion.\n- The system is in dimension $d=3$.\n- The relevant universality class has an upper critical dimension $d_c=4$.\n- Therefore, $\\epsilon = d_c - d = 4 - 3 = 1$.\n- We use the hyperscaling relation $\\alpha = 2 - d\\nu$.\n- We use the first-order $\\epsilon$-expansion for the correlation length exponent $\\nu$ for the O(n) model: $\\nu = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{n+2}{4(n+8)}\\epsilon$.\n- Combining these gives the expression for $\\alpha$: $\\alpha = \\frac{4-n}{2(n+8)}\\epsilon$.\n- Assuming the Ising universality class (n=1), which is standard.\n- Substituting $n=1$ and $\\epsilon=1$: $\\alpha = \\frac{4-1}{2(1+8)} = \\frac{3}{18} = \\frac{1}{6}$.\n\n<<<1/6>>>"
