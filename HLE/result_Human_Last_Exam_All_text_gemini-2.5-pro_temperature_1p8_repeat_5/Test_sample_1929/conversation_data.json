    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction between butadiene and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**1. Identify the Reactants and Reaction Type**\n*   **Reactant 1: Butadiene (1,3-butadiene)**\n    *   Structure: CH₂=CH-CH=CH₂\n    *   Classification: It is a conjugated diene. The two double bonds are separated by a single bond, allowing the pi electrons to be delocalized over all four carbon atoms. In the context of cycloadditions, it acts as the **diene**.\n*   **Reactant 2: 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene**\n    *   Structure: CCl₂=CF₂\n    *   Classification: It is a substituted alkene. The double bond is substituted with highly electronegative halogen atoms (chlorine and fluorine), which are electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs). Alkenes with EWGs are excellent partners in Diels-Alder reactions, where they act as the **dienophile**.\n*   **Reaction Type:** The reaction between a conjugated diene and a dienophile is a **Diels-Alder reaction**. This is a specific type of pericyclic reaction known as a [4+2] cycloaddition, where the 4 pi electrons of the diene and the 2 pi electrons of the dienophile rearrange to form a new six-membered ring.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction Mechanism**\n*   The Diels-Alder reaction is a concerted process, meaning all bond-making and bond-breaking occurs in a single step through a cyclic transition state.\n*   Let's number the carbons for clarity:\n    *   Butadiene: C¹H₂=C²H−C³H=C⁴H₂\n    *   Dienophile: CᵃCl₂=CᵇF₂\n*   The electron movement involves three pairs of pi electrons:\n    1.  The pi bond between C¹ and C² of butadiene forms a new sigma bond with Cᵃ of the dienophile.\n    2.  The pi bond of the dienophile (Cᵃ=Cᵇ) breaks, and those electrons form a new sigma bond between Cᵇ and C⁴ of butadiene.\n    3.  The pi bond between C³ and C⁴ of butadiene moves to form a new pi bond between C² and C³.\n*   This process results in the formation of a six-membered ring containing one double bond (a cyclohexene derivative).\n\n**3. Determine the Structure of the Product**\n*   The backbone of the new ring is formed by the four carbons from butadiene and the two carbons from the dienophile.\n*   The connectivity will be: `-C¹H₂-C²H=C³H-C⁴H₂-CᵇF₂-CᵃCl₂-` cyclized.\n*   Drawing this as a standard six-membered ring (cyclohexene) gives the following structure:\n    *   The two central carbons of the original diene (C² and C³) become the double-bonded carbons of the cyclohexene ring (-CH=CH-).\n    *   The two outer carbons of the original diene (C¹ and C⁴) become saturated -CH₂- groups adjacent to the new double bond.\n    *   The two carbons of the dienophile become saturated carbons in the ring, retaining their substituents. One carbon is bonded to two chlorine atoms (-CCl₂-), and the other is bonded to two fluorine atoms (-CF₂-). These two carbons are adjacent to each other.\n*   The final structure is a cyclohexene ring where the two saturated carbons not adjacent to the double bond bear the halogen substituents.\n\n**4. Name the Product (IUPAC Nomenclature)**\n1.  **Identify the Parent Ring:** The six-membered ring with one double bond is **cyclohexene**.\n2.  **Number the Ring:**\n    *   According to IUPAC rules, the carbons of the double bond are always numbered C1 and C2.\n    *   We then number around the ring in the direction that gives the substituents the lowest possible locants (numbers).\n    *   **Path A (Clockwise):** Numbering so the -CCl₂ group is at position 4 and the -CF₂ group is at position 5. The substituents are 4,4-dichloro and 5,5-difluoro. The locant set is {4,4,5,5}.\n    *   **Path B (Counter-clockwise):** Numbering so the -CF₂ group is at position 4 and the -CCl₂ group is at position 5. The substituents are 4,4-difluoro and 5,5-dichloro. The locant set is {4,4,5,5}.\n3.  **Apply Tie-Breaking Rule:** Since both numbering directions yield the identical locant set {4,4,5,5}, we use alphabetical order to decide the final numbering. The prefixes are \"chloro\" and \"fluoro\".\n    *   Alphabetically, \"chloro\" comes before \"fluoro\".\n    *   The rule states that the alphabetically prior group should be assigned the lower locant.\n    *   Therefore, the \"dichloro\" group gets position 4, and the \"difluoro\" group gets position 5. This corresponds to Path A.\n4.  **Assemble the Final Name:** The correct name is **4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohex-1-ene**. (The \"-1-\" is often omitted when there is no ambiguity, but its inclusion is more formally correct).\n\n### **Careful Points**\n\n*   **Symmetry:** Both reactants are symmetrical (butadiene about its center, and the dienophile about a plane bisecting the C=C bond). This simplifies the reaction, as there is no issue of regioselectivity (i.e., there is only one possible way for them to connect).\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reaction does not create any new chiral centers in the product molecule. The carbons bearing the halogens (C4 and C5) are each bonded to two identical atoms (two Cl or two F), and the other ring carbons are either sp² hybridized or are CH₂ groups. Therefore, the product is achiral, and we do not need to consider endo/exo selectivity.\n*   **Reaction Conditions:** Diels-Alder reactions are thermally allowed and are often performed by heating the reactants together, without the need for a catalyst.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nThe product of the Diels-Alder reaction between butadiene and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene is **4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohex-1-ene**.\n\n<<<4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohex-1-ene>>>"
