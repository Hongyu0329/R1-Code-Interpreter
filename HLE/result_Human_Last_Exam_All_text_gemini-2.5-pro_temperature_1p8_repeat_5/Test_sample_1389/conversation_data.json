    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the relationship between the 1-incidence rate ratio and the per-exposure vaccine efficacy for an all-or-nothing vaccine.\n\n### **Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n**Step 1: Define the Key Concepts**\n\n*   **All-or-Nothing Vaccine:** This is a hypothetical vaccine model where the vaccine provides complete and total protection to a certain fraction of vaccinated individuals, but provides absolutely no protection to the remaining fraction.\n*   **Per-exposure Vaccine Efficacy (VE_p):** This measures the proportional reduction in the probability of infection from a single infectious exposure. For a vaccinated individual compared to an unvaccinated one.\n*   **Incidence Rate (I):** The rate at which new cases of a disease occur in a population over a specific period of time.\n    *   `I_v`: Incidence rate in the vaccinated group.\n    *   `I_u`: Incidence rate in the unvaccinated (or placebo) group.\n*   **Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR):** The ratio of the incidence rate in the vaccinated group to the incidence rate in the unvaccinated group. `IRR = I_v / I_u`.\n*   **1 - IRR:** This is a common formula used to calculate vaccine efficacy from observational or trial data.\n\n**Step 2: Model the Per-exposure Vaccine Efficacy (VE_p)**\n\nLet `p` be the proportion of vaccinated individuals who are fully protected by the vaccine.\nLet `1-p` be the proportion of vaccinated individuals who receive no protection at all.\n\n*   For a protected individual (proportion `p`), the risk of infection per exposure is 0. Their per-exposure efficacy is 100% or `VE_p = 1`.\n*   For an unprotected individual (proportion `1-p`), the risk of infection per exposure is the same as an unvaccinated person. Their per-exposure efficacy is 0% or `VE_p = 0`.\n\nThe average per-exposure vaccine efficacy for the entire vaccinated population is the weighted average of the efficacies of the two subgroups.\nAverage `VE_p = (p * 1) + ((1-p) * 0) = p`\n\nSo, for an all-or-nothing vaccine, the true per-exposure efficacy is `p`.\n\n**Step 3: Model the Incidence Rates and the IRR**\n\nLet `λ` (lambda) represent the force of infection, which is the per-capita rate at which susceptible individuals become infected. We assume that vaccinated and unvaccinated groups are exposed to the same force of infection (a standard assumption in randomized trials).\n\n*   **Incidence in the Unvaccinated Group (`I_u`):** For the unvaccinated, the incidence rate is simply the force of infection.\n    `I_u = λ`\n*   **Incidence in the Vaccinated Group (`I_v`):** The vaccinated group is a mixture.\n    *   The protected individuals (proportion `p`) have an incidence rate of 0.\n    *   The unprotected individuals (proportion `1-p`) have an incidence rate of `λ`.\n    The overall incidence rate for the vaccinated group is the weighted average:\n    `I_v = (p * 0) + ((1-p) * λ) = (1-p)λ`\n\n**Step 4: Calculate (1 - IRR) and Compare to VE_p**\n\nNow, we can calculate the Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR):\n`IRR = I_v / I_u = ((1-p)λ) / λ`\n\nThe `λ` term cancels out:\n`IRR = 1 - p`\n\nThe quantity we are asked to evaluate is `1 - IRR`:\n`1 - IRR = 1 - (1 - p) = p`\n\nNow, we compare this result with the per-exposure vaccine efficacy we derived in Step 2.\n*   Calculated measure: `1 - IRR = p`\n*   True per-exposure efficacy: `VE_p = p`\n\nSince `1 - IRR = VE_p`, the two quantities are equal.\n\n### **Careful Points to Note**\n\n1.  **Vaccine Model:** This conclusion is specific to the \"all-or-nothing\" vaccine model. The result would be different for a \"leaky\" vaccine (where all vaccinated individuals get partial protection).\n2.  **Equal Exposure Assumption:** The analysis relies on the assumption that both vaccinated and unvaccinated groups have the same level of exposure to the pathogen (`λ`). This is generally a valid assumption in a well-designed randomized controlled trial.\n3.  **Rates vs. Risks:** The question specifies \"incidence rate ratio\". The conclusion also holds if we use the \"risk ratio\" (based on cumulative incidence over a period) for an all-or-nothing vaccine.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nFor an all-or-nothing vaccine, the measure `1 - Incidence Rate Ratio` perfectly matches the true average per-exposure vaccine efficacy. Therefore, it **correctly estimates** the per-exposure vaccine efficacy.\n\n<<<C>>>"
