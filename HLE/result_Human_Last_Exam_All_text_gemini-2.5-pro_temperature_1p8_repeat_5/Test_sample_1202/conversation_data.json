    "**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The core of the question is to identify the most common or probable evolutionary mechanism that allows a duplicated gene to be kept in the genome (retention) rather than being lost, and for its sequence to change compared to the original copy (divergence).\n\n2.  **Understand the Starting Point: Gene Duplication.** When a gene is duplicated, the cell has an extra, redundant copy. One copy is sufficient to perform the original biological function. This redundancy means the second copy is not under strong purifying selection and can accumulate mutations without harming the organism.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Possible Fates and Mechanisms:**\n    *   **The most common fate is loss.** The redundant gene copy accumulates mutations that destroy its function (e.g., a premature stop codon). It becomes a non-functional remnant called a pseudogene. This process is **Pseudogenization (B)**. While this involves divergence, it is a mechanism of gene *loss*, not *retention* of a functional gene. Therefore, it's not the answer.\n    *   **Mechanism to prevent divergence:** **Gene conversion (A)** is a process where one gene copy is used as a template to \"correct\" the other, making them identical or very similar. This process actively works *against* divergence and thus cannot be the primary mechanism responsible for it.\n    *   **Mechanism on the wrong scale:** **Adaptive radiation (E)** is a macroevolutionary pattern of species diversification. While gene duplication can provide the raw genetic material that fuels adaptive radiation, it is not the direct molecular mechanism responsible for retaining individual duplicate genes within a genome.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Primary Mechanisms for Retention and Divergence:** We are left with Neofunctionalization and Subfunctionalization. Both are well-established models.\n    *   **Neofunctionalization (C):** In this model, one copy keeps the original function, while the second, redundant copy accumulates mutations. By chance, a mutation may arise that gives the duplicate gene a completely *new* beneficial function. Selection then acts to preserve this new gene. This process explains both retention (due to the new benefit) and divergence (as the gene sequence changes to acquire the new function).\n    *   **Subfunctionalization (D):** This model proposes that the ancestral gene had multiple distinct functions or expression patterns (e.g., it was active in both liver and brain tissue). After duplication, each copy can independently lose one of the subfunctions through degenerative mutations. For instance, copy 1 might lose its brain function but keep its liver function, while copy 2 loses its liver function but keeps its brain function. Now, both genes are required to carry out the complete set of original functions. This process is also known as the Duplication-Degeneration-Complementation (DDC) model. It explains retention (both copies are now necessary) and divergence (they have different disabling mutations and can drift further apart).\n\n5.  **Determine Which is \"Most Likely\":** The question asks for the *most likely* mechanism.\n    *   Neofunctionalization requires the occurrence of a rare event: a beneficial mutation that creates a new function. This has to happen before the redundant gene is lost through pseudogenization.\n    *   Subfunctionalization, on the other hand, relies on a much more common event: a loss-of-function mutation. Since most mutations that affect function are deleterious or neutral, a mutation that simply disables one part of a gene's function is far more probable than one that creates a brand-new, useful function.\n    *   Therefore, many evolutionary biologists argue that subfunctionalization provides a more common and passive route for duplicate genes to be preserved from initial loss. It effectively creates a \"safe harbor\" where both genes are maintained by selection, allowing them more time to potentially evolve new functions later. Because it relies on more probable mutational events, subfunctionalization is considered the more likely mechanism for the initial retention and subsequent divergence of many duplicate genes.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nSubfunctionalization is considered the most likely mechanism because it depends on common degenerative mutations to partition ancestral functions, providing a high-probability pathway for retaining both gene copies, whereas neofunctionalization relies on the rarer event of a beneficial gain-of-function mutation.\n\n<<<D>>>"
