    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the shape of the water surface.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Geometry of the Icosahedron**\nAn icosahedron is a regular polyhedron composed of 20 identical equilateral triangular faces, 30 identical edges, and 12 vertices. A key property of the regular icosahedron is that it has a center of symmetry (or inversion center). This means for any point on the icosahedron, there is an identical point on the opposite side, equidistant from the center.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Orientation of the Tank**\nThe tank is \"standing on one of its faces.\" This means one of the triangular faces is serving as a horizontal base. Due to the symmetry of the icosahedron, the face directly opposite the base will be parallel to it and will form the top of the tank.\n\n**Step 3: Interpret the \"Half-Filled\" Condition**\nThe tank is half-filled with water, which means the volume of the water is exactly half the total volume of the icosahedron. Since the tank is standing on a horizontal base, the surface of the water will also be a horizontal plane. The task is to determine the shape of this horizontal water surface.\n\n**Step 4: Use Symmetry to Locate the Water Level**\nBecause the icosahedron is centrally symmetric, any plane that passes through its center divides its volume into two equal halves. The center of the icosahedron, when it's standing on a face, lies exactly at the midpoint of its total height (the perpendicular distance between the bottom and top faces).\nFor the water volume to be exactly half the total volume, the horizontal water surface must be the plane that passes through the icosahedron's center. Therefore, the water level is precisely at half the tank's height.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the Shape of the Cross-Section at Mid-Height**\nThe shape of the water surface is the shape of the horizontal cross-section of the icosahedron at its mid-height. We can determine this shape by considering the symmetries of the icosahedron in this orientation.\n\n*   **Rotational Symmetry:** The vertical axis passing through the centers of the bottom and top triangular faces is an axis of 3-fold rotational symmetry. Rotating the icosahedron by 120° or 240° around this axis leaves it unchanged. Consequently, any horizontal cross-section, including the one at mid-height, must also have 3-fold rotational symmetry.\n\n*   **Central Symmetry:** As established in Step 4, the water surface plane passes through the center of inversion of the icosahedron. This means the 2D shape of the cross-section must itself be centrally symmetric.\n\n*   **Combining Symmetries:** A 2D geometric shape that has both 3-fold rotational symmetry and central symmetry must also have 6-fold rotational symmetry. (A rotation of 180°, which is central symmetry in 2D, combined with a rotation of 120°, can generate a rotation of 60°). The vertices of the cross-sectional polygon are formed where the mid-plane intersects the edges of the icosahedron. A polygon with 6-fold symmetry, whose vertices lie on a circle, is a regular hexagon.\n\n**Conclusion**\nBased on the symmetry properties of the icosahedron, the horizontal cross-section at its center, which corresponds to the water surface when it's half-filled, must be a regular hexagon.\n\n**List of Careful Points:**\n1.  Recognize that a regular icosahedron has a center of symmetry.\n2.  Understand that standing on a face implies a parallel top face.\n3.  Correctly deduce that \"half-filled\" means the water surface is a horizontal plane passing through the center of the icosahedron.\n4.  Identify the 3-fold rotational symmetry axis perpendicular to the base.\n5.  Combine the 3-fold rotational symmetry and the central symmetry of the cross-section to deduce it must have 6-fold symmetry.\n6.  Conclude that a polygon with 6-fold symmetry is a regular hexagon.\n\nThe shape of the water surface will be a regular hexagon.\n\n<<<A regular hexagon>>>"
