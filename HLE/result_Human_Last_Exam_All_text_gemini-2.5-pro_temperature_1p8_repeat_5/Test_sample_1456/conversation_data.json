    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the largest possible number of composants of the product of two nondegenerate continua.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Definitions:**\n    *   **Continuum:** A compact, connected metric space.\n    *   **Nondegenerate Continuum:** A continuum containing more than one point. Examples include a closed interval `[0, 1]`, a circle, a disk, or more complex spaces like the pseudo-arc.\n    *   **Subcontinuum:** A subset of a continuum that is itself a continuum. A *proper* subcontinuum is a subcontinuum that is not the entire space.\n    *   **Composant:** For a point `p` in a continuum `X`, the composant of `p` (denoted `C(p)`) is the set of all points `q` in `X` such that `p` and `q` are contained in some proper subcontinuum of `X`. In other words, `C(p)` is the union of all proper subcontinua of `X` that contain `p`.\n    *   **Product of Continua:** If `X` and `Y` are continua, their Cartesian product `X × Y` with the product topology is also a continuum. Since `X` and `Y` are nondegenerate, `X × Y` is also nondegenerate.\n\n2.  **Relate Number of Composants to Decomposability:**\n    The number of composants of a continuum `Z` depends critically on whether `Z` is decomposable or indecomposable.\n    *   **Decomposable Continuum:** A continuum `Z` is decomposable if it can be written as the union of two of its proper subcontinua.\n        *   **Key Property:** If a continuum is decomposable, it has exactly **one** composant, which is the entire space itself. For any two points `p` and `q` in a decomposable continuum, one can show they belong to the same composant.\n    *   **Indecomposable Continuum:** A continuum is indecomposable if it is not decomposable.\n        *   **Key Property:** Any nondegenerate indecomposable continuum has **uncountably many** disjoint composants. The cardinality of the set of composants is **c** (the cardinality of the continuum, `2^ℵ₀`). Each composant is a dense subset of the space.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Decomposability of the Product Space `X × Y`:**\n    To find the largest possible number of composants for `X × Y`, we need to see if we can make `X × Y` indecomposable. This depends on the properties of `X` and `Y`.\n\n    *   **Case 1: At least one of the continua is decomposable.**\n        Let's assume `X` is decomposable. By definition, there exist two proper subcontinua, `X₁` and `X₂`, such that `X = X₁ ∪ X₂`.\n        Now consider the product space `Z = X × Y`. We can write it as:\n        `Z = (X₁ ∪ X₂) × Y = (X₁ × Y) ∪ (X₂ × Y)`\n        Let `A = X₁ × Y` and `B = X₂ × Y`.\n        *   Is `A` a continuum? Yes, it's the product of two continua. Is it a *proper* subcontinuum of `Z`? Yes, because `X₁` is a proper subset of `X`, so `A` is a proper subset of `Z`.\n        *   Similarly, `B = X₂ × Y` is a proper subcontinuum of `Z`.\n        Since we have expressed `Z` as the union of two of its proper subcontinua (`A` and `B`), the product space `Z = X × Y` is **decomposable**.\n        *   **Conclusion for Case 1:** If either `X` or `Y` (or both) is decomposable, the product `X × Y` is decomposable. A decomposable continuum has exactly **1** composant.\n\n    *   **Case 2: Both continua are indecomposable.**\n        Now, let's consider the situation where both `X` and `Y` are indecomposable continua. Nondegenerate examples of such spaces exist, for instance, the pseudo-arc or the Knaster \"buckethandle\" continuum.\n        There is a fundamental theorem in continuum theory (due to R. H. Bing) that states:\n        *   **Theorem:** The Cartesian product `X × Y` of two continua is indecomposable if and only if both `X` and `Y` are indecomposable.\n        Therefore, if we choose `X` and `Y` to be any two nondegenerate indecomposable continua, their product `X × Y` will also be an indecomposable continuum.\n        *   **Conclusion for Case 2:** If both `X` and `Y` are indecomposable, the product `X × Y` is indecomposable. As established earlier, a nondegenerate indecomposable continuum has **c** (the cardinality of the continuum) composants.\n\n4.  **Determine the Largest Possible Number:**\n    We have found two possibilities for the number of composants of `X × Y`:\n    *   **1**, if at least one factor is decomposable.\n    *   **c** (uncountably many), if both factors are indecomposable.\n\n    The question asks for the *largest possible number*. Comparing 1 and **c**, the largest value is **c**.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nThe number of composants of the product of two nondegenerate continua `X` and `Y` can be either 1 (if at least one of `X` or `Y` is decomposable) or **c** (the cardinality of the continuum, if both `X` and `Y` are indecomposable). The largest of these two possibilities is **c**.\n\n<<<c>>>"
