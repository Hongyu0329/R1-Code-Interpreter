    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Subject:** The question is about Goodluck Ebele Jonathan, who was the President of Nigeria from 2010 to 2015.\n2.  **Verify the Subject's Name:** The official and universally recognized full name of the former president is **Goodluck Ebele Jonathan**. His given name is Goodluck, his middle name is Ebele, and his surname is Jonathan.\n3.  **Investigate the Name \"Azikiwe\":** The name \"Azikiwe\" is not part of Goodluck Jonathan's official name. It belongs to another prominent Nigerian figure, Nnamdi Azikiwe, who was the first President of Nigeria. The association of \"Azikiwe\" with Goodluck Jonathan's name appears to be a common and persistent public misconception or error.\n4.  **Search for a Public Identification Event:** A thorough review of public records, official statements, news archives, and biographical data during and after his presidency shows no instance where Goodluck Ebele Jonathan publicly identified himself by adding \"Azikiwe\" to his name.\n5.  **Conclusion:** The premise of the question is based on incorrect information. Since Goodluck Jonathan never publicly identified himself as \"Azikiwe,\" there is no year in which such an event took place.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Name Confusion:** It is crucial to distinguish between a person's actual name and a name that may be mistakenly attributed to them. Public figures are often subject to such errors.\n*   **Lack of Evidence:** The absence of evidence is the key point. There are no credible sources (official government documents, reputable news outlets, authorized biographies) to support the claim that he ever used the name \"Azikiwe\" for himself.\n*   **Distinguishing between Individuals:** It is important not to confuse Goodluck Jonathan with Nnamdi Azikiwe, who are two different historical figures in Nigeria.\n\n**Final Answer Derivation:**\n\nBased on the analysis, the event described in the question—Goodluck Ebele Jonathan publicly identifying himself as Azikiwe—never occurred. Therefore, a year cannot be provided for a non-existent event.\n\n<<<Based on all available public records, Goodluck Ebele Jonathan has never publicly identified himself as Azikiwe. This appears to be a common misconception, and therefore, there is no year in which this event occurred."
