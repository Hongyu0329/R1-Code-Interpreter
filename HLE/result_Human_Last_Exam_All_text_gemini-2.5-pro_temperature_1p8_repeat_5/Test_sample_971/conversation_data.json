    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Specifics of the Question**\nThe question asks for the number of a very particular ballet step: \"single-turn pirouette en dehors from the fifth position.\" We must identify this exact step in a specific performance: Natalia Osipova dancing as Kitri in the Bolshoi Ballet's 2008 production of *Don Quixote*, specifically during her Act I variation.\n\n**Step 2: Define the Ballet Terminology**\n*   **Pirouette en dehors:** An outward turn on one leg, where the dancer turns away from the supporting leg.\n*   **From the fifth position:** This is the crucial part. It means the pirouette must be initiated from a preparatory stance where both feet are in the fifth position. The dancer would typically plié (bend the knees) in the fifth position before pushing off into the turn.\n*   **Act I Variation:** This is Kitri's first major solo in the ballet, occurring in the village square scene. It is famous for its use of a fan and its technical difficulty.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Choreography of Kitri's Act I Variation**\nTo find the answer, we must mentally or visually review the choreography of this variation as performed by Osipova in 2008. The main turning sequences in this variation are:\n1.  **A Diagonal of Piqué Turns:** Kitri performs a series of fast turns across the stage. A piqué turn is initiated by stepping directly onto the point or demi-pointe of the turning leg. It does not start from a two-footed fifth position plié. Therefore, these do not count.\n2.  **The Central Sequence of Turns with the Fan:** This is the most famous part of the variation. Kitri performs a series of rapid turns in place while opening and closing her fan. However, these are technically *fouetté turns*, not pirouettes from the fifth position. A fouetté turn is propelled by a continuous \"whipping\" action of the working leg, and each turn flows into the next without stopping and re-preparing in a fifth position.\n\n**Step 4: Careful Scrutiny of the Entire Variation**\nReviewing the complete solo from beginning to end, we look for any other instances of the specified step. The variation is primarily composed of balances, jumps (like *sissones* and *assemblés*), the piqué turns, and the fouetté turns. There is no point in the standard choreography for this variation where the dancer stops and executes a series of single pirouettes prepared from the fifth position.\n\n**Step 5: Conclusion**\nBased on the precise technical requirements stated in the question (\"pirouette en dehors from the fifth position\"), Natalia Osipova does not perform this specific step during her Act I variation in the 2008 Bolshoi *Don Quixote*. The prominent turning passages in the solo use different techniques (piqué and fouetté turns). Therefore, the count is zero.\n\n<<<0>>>"
