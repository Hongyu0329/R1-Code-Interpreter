    "This is a classic and deep question in the field of continuum theory, a branch of topology. To determine the number of homeomorphism classes, we need to identify all possible topological structures that satisfy the given conditions.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the terms:**\n    *   **Continuum:** A non-empty, compact, connected metric space.\n    *   **Planar:** The continuum can be embedded in the Euclidean plane (ℝ²). This means there is a subset of the plane that is homeomorphic to the continuum.\n    *   **Homogeneous:** The space \"looks the same\" at every point. Formally, for any two points *x* and *y* in the space, there exists a homeomorphism *h* from the space to itself such that *h(x) = y*.\n    *   **Homeomorphism Class:** We are counting the number of topologically distinct types of these spaces. Two spaces are in the same class if they are homeomorphic.\n\n2.  **Case 1: The degenerate continuum.**\n    *   A single point is a non-empty, compact, connected metric space, so it is a continuum.\n    *   It is trivially planar and homogeneous.\n    *   Therefore, the **single point** constitutes one homeomorphism class.\n\n3.  **Case 2: Non-degenerate continua.**\n    *   This is the more complex part of the problem. The classification of non-degenerate homogeneous planar continua was a major research program in topology, solved through the work of numerous mathematicians like R. H. Bing, F. Burton Jones, Edwin Moise, James T. Rogers, Jr., and others over several decades.\n    *   The final classification theorem states that there are exactly three non-degenerate homogeneous planar continua, up to homeomorphism.\n\n4.  **Identifying the three non-degenerate classes:**\n\n    *   **a) The Circle (S¹):**\n        *   **Description:** A simple closed curve.\n        *   **Properties:** It is compact, connected, and planar. It is homogeneous because any point can be rotated to any other point. It is also *locally connected*. It is the only *decomposable* homogeneous planar continuum (meaning it can be written as the union of two proper subcontinua).\n        *   This forms the second homeomorphism class.\n\n    *   **b) The Pseudo-arc:**\n        *   **Description:** A pathological, snake-like continuum. It is *indecomposable* (cannot be written as the union of two proper subcontinua) and *arc-like* (or chainable). Despite its complexity, it is embeddable in the plane.\n        *   **Properties:** Bing proved in 1948 that the pseudo-arc is homogeneous. It is the unique (up to homeomorphism) hereditarily indecomposable, arc-like continuum. It does not separate the plane.\n        *   This forms the third homeomorphism class.\n\n    *   **c) The Circle of Pseudo-arcs:**\n        *   **Description:** This continuum is constructed by \"replacing\" each point of a circle with a pseudo-arc in a specific continuous manner. It is also an indecomposable continuum.\n        *   **Properties:** It is homogeneous and planar. Unlike the pseudo-arc, it is not arc-like. It separates the plane into two components, just like a standard circle does.\n        *   This forms the fourth homeomorphism class.\n\n5.  **Summary of Careful Points:**\n    *   One must not forget the degenerate case (the single point), which fits all the criteria.\n    *   The non-degenerate case relies on a deep, hard-won classification theorem. We don't derive it here, but apply its result.\n    *   The three non-degenerate classes (circle, pseudo-arc, circle of pseudo-arcs) are genuinely distinct topologically. For instance:\n        *   The circle is locally connected; the other two are not.\n        *   The circle is decomposable; the other two are not.\n        *   The pseudo-arc is arc-like; the circle of pseudo-arcs is not.\n        *   The point is distinguished by being finite.\n\n6.  **Final Count:**\n    Combining the degenerate and non-degenerate cases, we have identified four distinct homeomorphism classes:\n    1.  The Point\n    2.  The Circle\n    3.  The Pseudo-arc\n    4.  The Circle of Pseudo-arcs\n\nThere are no others. Therefore, the total number of homeomorphism classes of homogeneous planar continua is 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
