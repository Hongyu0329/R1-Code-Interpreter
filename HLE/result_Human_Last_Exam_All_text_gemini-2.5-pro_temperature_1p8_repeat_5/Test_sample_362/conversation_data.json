    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the product of the given Wittig reaction.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Identify and Draw the Structures of the Reactants**\n\n*   **Aldehyde:** The first reactant is **pivalaldehyde**, also known systematically as 2,2-dimethylpropanal. The \"pival\" group is a synonym for the tert-butyl group, (CH₃)₃C-. An aldehyde has a -CHO functional group. Therefore, the structure of pivalaldehyde is:\n    (CH₃)₃C-CHO\n\n*   **Wittig Reagent (Phosphorus Ylide):** The second reactant is **(2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ⁵-phosphane**. Let's break down this name to determine its structure:\n    *   \"triphenyl-λ⁵-phosphane\" indicates a phosphorus atom attached to three phenyl groups (PPh₃). The λ⁵ notation indicates a phosphorus atom with a bonding number of 5, which is characteristic of an ylide where there is a double bond to carbon.\n    *   \"ethylidene\" refers to a two-carbon group attached by a double bond, written as =CH-CH₃.\n    *   \"(2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)\" means that on the ethylidene group, there is a \"2-chlorophenyl\" substituent on the second carbon atom. A 2-chlorophenyl group is a benzene ring with a chlorine atom at position 2.\n    *   Combining these parts, the structure of the ylide is: Ph₃P=CH-CH₂-(C₆H₄-2-Cl).\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Mechanism of the Wittig Reaction**\n\nThe Wittig reaction is a chemical reaction of an aldehyde or a ketone with a phosphorus ylide to give an alkene and triphenylphosphine oxide. The core of the reaction is the exchange of the carbonyl oxygen atom of the aldehyde/ketone with the carbon group of the ylide.\n\nThe general transformation is:\nR¹R²C=O + Ph₃P=CR³R⁴  →  R¹R²C=CR³R⁴ + Ph₃P=O\n\n**Step 3: Apply the Reaction to the Specific Reactants**\n\n*   We react pivalaldehyde, (CH₃)₃C-CH=O, with the ylide, Ph₃P=CH-CH₂-(C₆H₄-2-Cl).\n*   The C=O double bond of pivalaldehyde breaks.\n*   The P=C double bond of the ylide breaks.\n*   A new C=C double bond forms between the carbonyl carbon of pivalaldehyde and the ylide carbon.\n*   A new P=O double bond forms, creating the byproduct triphenylphosphine oxide (Ph₃P=O).\n\nThe main organic product is formed by connecting the carbon skeletons:\n(CH₃)₃C-CH=O   +   Ph₃P=CH-CH₂-(C₆H₄-2-Cl)\n        ↓\n(CH₃)₃C-CH = CH-CH₂-(C₆H₄-2-Cl)   +   Ph₃P=O\n\n**Step 4: Name the Resulting Product**\n\nThe structure of the product is (CH₃)₃C-CH=CH-CH₂-(C₆H₄-2-Cl). To name this alkene using IUPAC rules:\n1.  Find the longest carbon chain containing the double bond. The chain is a pentene chain (-C-C-C=C-C-).\n2.  Number the chain to give the double bond the lowest possible number. We number from the end closer to the phenyl group.\n      ¹CH₂ - ²CH = ³CH - ⁴C(CH₃)₂ - ⁵CH₃  (Incorrect - chain has a phenyl group, not just a carbon)\n    Let's correct the numbering of the chain:\n    (2-Cl-C₆H₄) - ¹CH₂ - ²CH = ³CH - ⁴C(CH₃)₃\n3.  The double bond starts at carbon-2, so the parent name is **pent-2-ene**.\n4.  Identify and name the substituents:\n    *   At position 1: A **2-chlorophenyl** group.\n    *   At position 4: Two **methyl** groups.\n5.  Combine the names: **1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene**.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Reactant Structures:** It is crucial to correctly interpret the chemical names to draw the starting materials. Pivalaldehyde is a common name for 2,2-dimethylpropanal. The IUPAC name for the ylide is systematic and must be parsed carefully.\n*   **Reaction Mechanism:** The core concept of the Wittig reaction is the direct replacement of O with the C-group from the ylide. Mistaking this can lead to incorrect connectivity in the product.\n*   **Stereochemistry (E/Z Isomerism):** The product alkene has a double bond with different substituents on each carbon, so it can exist as E and Z isomers.\n    *   The ylide used, Ph₃P=CH-CH₂-R, is an **unstabilized ylide** because the carbanion in its resonance form is not stabilized by an adjacent electron-withdrawing group (like a C=O or CN group).\n    *   Wittig reactions involving unstabilized ylides typically, under standard conditions (not \"salt-free\"), favor the formation of the **Z-isomer** (also called the cis-isomer). In the Z-isomer, the highest-priority groups on each carbon of the double bond are on the same side.\n    *   For our product, the highest priority group on C-3 is the tert-butyl group, and on C-2 is the 2-chlorophenylethyl group. The major product would be (Z)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene.\n    *   However, since the question asks for \"the product\" without specifying conditions, naming the compound without specifying the stereoisomer is generally sufficient. The reaction typically produces a mixture of E and Z isomers, with Z being major.\n\n### Final Answer Acquisition\n\n1.  **Reactants:** Pivalaldehyde ((CH₃)₃CCHO) and (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenylphosphorane (Ph₃P=CHCH₂(C₆H₄-2-Cl)).\n2.  **Transformation:** The oxygen of the aldehyde is swapped with the `=CHCH₂(C₆H₄-2-Cl)` group from the ylide.\n3.  **Product Structure:** (CH₃)₃C-CH=CH-CH₂-(C₆H₄-2-Cl).\n4.  **Product Name:** The final product is named **1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene**. The major stereoisomer formed is the Z-isomer.\n\n<<<1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene>>>"
