    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the smallest size of a set $A \\subset G$ that intersects every cyclic subgroup of $G = (\\mathbb{Z}/49\\mathbb{Z})^{2024}$.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Group G and its Cyclic Subgroups**\n\n*   The group is $G = (\\mathbb{Z}/49\\mathbb{Z})^{2024}$, a direct product of 2024 copies of the cyclic group of order 49.\n*   $G$ is an abelian group. An element in $G$ is of the form $g = (g_1, g_2, \\dots, g_{2024})$, where each $g_i \\in \\mathbb{Z}/49\\mathbb{Z}$.\n*   The order of an element in $\\mathbb{Z}/49\\mathbb{Z}$ can be 1, 7, or 49.\n*   The order of an element $g \\in G$ is $\\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(g_1), \\dots, \\text{ord}(g_{2024}))$. Thus, the possible orders of elements in $G$ are also 1, 7, and 49.\n*   A cyclic subgroup of $G$ is of the form $\\langle g \\rangle$ for some $g \\in G$. The order of this subgroup is the order of $g$. So, cyclic subgroups in $G$ can have order 1, 7, or 49.\n\n**2. Analyze the Condition on the Set A**\n\n*   The condition is that the set $A$ must have a non-empty intersection with *every* cyclic subgroup of $G$.\n*   Let's consider the types of cyclic subgroups:\n    *   **The trivial subgroup:** There is one cyclic subgroup of order 1, which is the trivial group $\\{e\\}$, where $e$ is the identity element of $G$. For $A \\cap \\{e\\}$ to be non-empty, we must have $e \\in A$.\n    *   **Cyclic subgroups of order 7.**\n    *   **Cyclic subgroups of order 49.**\n\n**3. Find a Strategy based on Minimal Subgroups (A Careful Point)**\n\n*   Let $H_{49} = \\langle g \\rangle$ be a cyclic subgroup of order 49. This subgroup contains a unique subgroup of order 7, which is $H_7 = \\langle 7g \\rangle$.\n*   If a set $A$ contains an element from $H_7$, then it also contains an element from $H_{49}$, since $H_7 \\subset H_{49}$.\n*   The minimal non-trivial subgroups in any group are those that do not contain any smaller non-trivial subgroups. In our case, the cyclic subgroups of order 7 are minimal non-trivial subgroups because 7 is a prime number.\n*   This leads to a crucial insight: A set $A$ intersects every non-trivial cyclic subgroup of $G$ if and only if it intersects every cyclic subgroup of order 7.\n*   Therefore, the problem is reduced to finding the minimal size of a set $A'$ that intersects every cyclic subgroup of order 7. The final answer will then be $|A'| + 1$ (to account for the identity element $e$).\n\n**4. Count the Cyclic Subgroups of Order 7**\n\n*   To find the number of cyclic subgroups of order 7, we first identify the elements that generate them. An element $g \\in G$ has order 7 if and only if $7g=e$ and $g \\neq e$.\n*   Let's consider the set $K = \\{g \\in G \\mid 7g = e\\}$. This set consists of the identity element and all elements of order 7.\n*   An element $g = (g_1, \\dots, g_{2024})$ satisfies $7g=e$ if and only if $7g_i=0$ in $\\mathbb{Z}/49\\mathbb{Z}$ for all $i=1, \\dots, 2024$.\n*   In $\\mathbb{Z}/49\\mathbb{Z}$, the solutions to $7x=0$ are the multiples of $49/7=7$. These are $\\{0, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42\\}$, which form a subgroup of order 7, isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z}$.\n*   Therefore, $K$ is isomorphic to the direct product $(\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z})^{2024}$.\n*   This set $K$ can be viewed as a vector space of dimension $n=2024$ over the field with 7 elements, $\\mathbb{F}_7$.\n*   A cyclic subgroup of order 7 is generated by a non-zero element in $K$. In the vector space analogy, a cyclic subgroup of order 7 is a 1-dimensional subspace of $K$.\n*   The number of 1-dimensional subspaces in a vector space of dimension $n$ over a field $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is given by the formula $\\frac{q^n - 1}{q-1}$.\n*   In our case, $q=7$ and $n=2024$. So, the number of cyclic subgroups of order 7 is:\n    $$N = \\frac{7^{2024} - 1}{7 - 1} = \\frac{7^{2024} - 1}{6}$$\n\n**5. Determine the Minimum Size of the Hitting Set A'**\n\n*   We need to find the minimum size of a set $A'$ that intersects every cyclic subgroup of order 7. Let these subgroups be $H_1, H_2, \\dots, H_N$.\n*   A key property of these subgroups is that they are disjoint except for the identity element. That is, for $i \\neq j$, $H_i \\cap H_j = \\{e\\}$. This is because if there were a non-zero element $x$ in the intersection, then $\\langle x \\rangle$ would be a subgroup of order 7 contained in both, implying $H_i = \\langle x \\rangle = H_j$, which contradicts the assumption that they are distinct subgroups.\n*   Since the subgroups are disjoint (apart from $e$), to intersect each $H_i$ with a non-zero element, we must choose a distinct non-zero element from each one.\n*   To cover all $N$ subgroups, we need at least $N$ distinct non-zero elements.\n*   We can achieve this minimum by constructing a set $A'$ that contains exactly one non-zero element from each of the $N$ cyclic subgroups of order 7.\n*   Therefore, the minimum size of $A'$ is $N = \\frac{7^{2024} - 1}{6}$.\n\n**6. Calculate the Final Answer**\n\n*   We established that the minimal set $A$ is the union of a minimal set $A'$ hitting all non-trivial subgroups and the set $\\{e\\}$ to hit the trivial subgroup.\n*   The minimum size of $A$ is $|A'| + 1$.\n*   $|A|_{min} = \\left(\\frac{7^{2024} - 1}{6}\\right) + 1 = \\frac{7^{2024} - 1 + 6}{6} = \\frac{7^{2024} + 5}{6}$.\n\nFinal check: the result must be an integer.\n$7 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 6$, so $7^{2024} \\equiv 1^{2024} \\equiv 1 \\pmod 6$.\nThen, $7^{2024} + 5 \\equiv 1 + 5 = 6 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 6$.\nThe numerator is divisible by 6, so the result is indeed an integer.\n\nThe final answer is the smallest size of the set $A$.\n\n$|A| = \\frac{7^{2024} + 5}{6}$.\n\n<<<($7^{2024}+5$)/6>>>"
