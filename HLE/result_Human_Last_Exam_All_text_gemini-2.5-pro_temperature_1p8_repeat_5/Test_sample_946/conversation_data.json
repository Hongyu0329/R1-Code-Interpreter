    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the key elements of the question.**\nThe question asks for the name of a specific character from a specific episode of an online cartoon series.\n*   **Series:** \"Homestar Runner\"\n*   **Episode:** \"Teen Girl Squad #15\"\n*   **Event:** Junior prom\n*   **Object:** A cardboard cutout\n*   **Subject:** A fictional singer\n\n**Step 2: Recall or research the plot of \"Teen Girl Squad #15\".**\nThis episode is the finale of the Teen Girl Squad series. The main characters—Cheerleader, So and So, The Ugly One, and What's Her Face—attend their Junior prom.\n\n**Step 3: Focus on the musical performance at the prom.**\nA common trope in media about proms is the appearance of a musical guest. In the style of Homestar Runner, this trope is subverted for comedic effect. Instead of a live band or popular singer, the \"performance\" is provided by an inanimate object.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the announcement of the performer.**\nDuring the prom scene, a voice-over from the prom announcer introduces the entertainment for the evening. The announcer explicitly names the fictional singer represented by the cardboard cutout.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the name of the fictional singer.**\nThe announcer's line is, \"And for tonight's entertainment... a cardboard cutout of... **Kassidy!!**\"\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n*   **Fictional vs. Real:** The question specifies a *fictional* singer. The character Kassidy exists only within the Homestar Runner universe.\n*   **Cutout vs. Live:** It is crucial to note that it is a *cardboard cutout* of the singer, not the singer herself, which is the central joke.\n*   **Source Confirmation:** This information is directly stated in the dialogue of the cartoon and can be verified by watching the episode or reading its transcript on a reliable fan wiki like the Homestar Runner Wiki.\n*   **Spelling:** The name is spelled \"Kassidy\".\n\nBased on this step-by-step analysis, the name of the fictional singer is Kassidy.\n\n<<<Kassidy>>>"
