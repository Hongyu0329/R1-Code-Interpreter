    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the lowest of the last three notes played by the first violin in Dvořák's Symphony No. 2.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core question**\nThe goal is to identify the last three notes played by the first violin section in Dvořák's Symphony No. 2, Op. 4, and then determine which of those three notes is the lowest in pitch.\n\n**Step 2: Locate the correct piece and section of the score**\nWe need to find the musical score for Dvořák's Symphony No. 2, Op. 4. The question refers to the very end of the symphony, so we must look at the last measures of the final movement, which is the 4th movement (Finale: Allegro con fuoco). We specifically need to focus on the staff for the \"Violino I\" (First Violin).\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the final measure for the first violins**\nUpon examining the score, we see that the symphony concludes with a powerful B-flat major chord played by the full orchestra. The first violins do not play a melody of three sequential notes. Instead, the question \"ends on three notes\" refers to how the first violin section plays its part of the final chord.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the \"three notes\" through the *divisi* instruction**\nIn the final measure, the first violin part is marked *div. a 3* (or *divisi a tre*). This is a musical instruction meaning \"divided in three.\" The first violin section splits into three smaller groups, with each group playing one note of a three-note chord. This is how the section plays \"three notes\" simultaneously.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the pitches of the three notes**\nThe three notes that the divided first violin section plays in this final chord are:\n1.  B-flat5 (the highest note)\n2.  F5 (the middle note)\n3.  D5 (the lowest note)\n(Using Scientific Pitch Notation where C4 is Middle C). These three notes (D, F, and B-flat) together form a B-flat major chord.\n\n**Step 6: Identify the lowest note**\nComparing the three notes played by the first violins (D5, F5, and B-flat5), the note with the lowest pitch is D5.\n\n<<<D>>>"
