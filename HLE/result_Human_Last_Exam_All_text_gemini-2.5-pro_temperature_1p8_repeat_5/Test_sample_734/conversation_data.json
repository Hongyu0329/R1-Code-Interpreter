    "**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The question asks for the identification of a specific Christian theologian who meets several criteria:\n    *   They must be the *first* to do this.\n    *   They must have developed *specialized terminology*.\n    *   This terminology must be able to describe *changes in the laws of nature*.\n    *   The terminology must be applicable to two specific theological events: the virgin birth of Jesus and possible changes in nature after the Fall of Man.\n\n2.  **Identify Major Theological Candidates:** The primary field of inquiry is the intersection of theology, creation, and miracles. Key figures in this area include Early Church Fathers like Irenaeus and Augustine of Hippo, and later Scholastic theologians like Thomas Aquinas and Duns Scotus.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Later Candidates (e.g., Thomas Aquinas):** Thomas Aquinas (13th century) developed the highly influential distinction between God's \"ordained power\" (*potentia ordinata*) and \"absolute power\" (*potentia absoluta*). God's *ordained power* upholds the regular laws of nature, while His *absolute power* allows Him to act outside of this order to perform miracles. While this terminology could explain the virgin birth (an act of absolute power), Aquinas generally did not argue that the fundamental laws of nature (e.g., biology of animals) changed at the Fall. More importantly, he was not the *first* theologian to develop a systematic explanation.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Earliest Major Candidate (Augustine of Hippo):** St. Augustine of Hippo (354-430 AD) extensively addressed the relationship between God's creative act and the ongoing processes of nature, particularly in his work *De Genesi ad litteram* (The Literal Meaning of Genesis).\n\n5.  **Analyze Augustine's Specialized Terminology:** Augustine developed the doctrine of ***rationes seminales*** (Latin for \"seminal reasons\" or \"causal reasons\"). This is his specialized terminology. The core idea is that in the initial act of creation, God embedded into matter the latent potentials or \"seeds\" for everything that would ever come into being. The normal course of nature is the gradual unfolding of these seeds over time according to a regular pattern.\n\n6.  **Apply Augustine's Terminology to the Virgin Birth:** According to this framework, a miracle like the virgin birth is not a violation of nature or a change in its laws. Instead, it is the divine activation of a *ratio seminalis* that God had placed in creation from the very beginning. It lies outside the *usual* course of nature that we observe, but it is not contrary to the deeper, potential-filled nature God originally created. God simply caused a potential He had already created to manifest at an unusual time and in an unusual way.\n\n7.  **Apply Augustine's Terminology to the Fall:** The concept of *rationes seminales* can also describe alterations in natural law at the Fall. Augustine taught that the pre-Fall creation was harmonious. The change after the Fall can be understood as an alteration in how these seminal reasons unfold. For example, the potentials for death, disease, and decay might have been present from the start but were held in check by a gift of grace in the original state of creation. After the Fall, this divine restraint was removed, allowing these negative potentials to manifest, thus changing the effective \"laws\" under which the natural world operates.\n\n8.  **Conclusion:** Augustine of Hippo was the first major Christian theologian to develop a sophisticated and specialized terminology (*rationes seminales*) to coherently explain both miracles (like the virgin birth) and systemic shifts in the natural order (like the effects of the Fall) without positing that God constantly violates His own creation. He predates the Scholastic theologians and provided the foundational concepts upon which many of them would later build.\n\n<<<Augustine of Hippo>>>"
