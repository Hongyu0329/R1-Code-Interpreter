    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to arrive at the solution.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Clues**\nThe question provides several key pieces of information:\n*   A Russian translation of an essay.\n*   The essay describes the wide boulevards of Vienna.\n*   In this description, the surname of an English poet is used.\n*   The task is to identify this surname in English.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Literary Source**\nThis specific and unusual reference points to a well-known piece of literature by a writer known for wordplay. The author is the Russian-American Nobel laureate Joseph Brodsky, and the essay is \"Journey to Istanbul\" (originally published in English as \"Flight from Byzantium,\" but the specific wording is found in his own Russian version, «Путешествие в Стамбул»).\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Key Passage**\nIn the essay, Brodsky reflects on the grandeur of Vienna's architecture, which he feels is oversized for the modern, smaller country of Austria. When describing the city's wide avenues, he writes a sentence that can be translated as:\n\"...hence these colossal architectural ensembles, hence these incredible **Бернсы** (Bernsy) of avenues, squaring the perspective.\"\n\n**Step 4: Isolate and Translate the Poet's Surname**\nThe unusual word here is **\"Бернсы\" (Bernsy)**. This is not a standard Russian word for avenues or boulevards (which would typically be \"проспекты\" or \"бульвары\"). Instead, it's a creative pluralization of the surname **\"Бернс\" (Berns)**.\n\nWhen transliterated from Russian back into English, \"Бернс\" corresponds to the surname **Burns**.\n\n**Step 5: Connect the Surname to an English Poet**\nThe most famous English-language poet with this surname is Robert Burns, the national poet of Scotland. While technically Scottish, in the context of world literature and such trivia questions, he is frequently categorized under the broader umbrella of \"British\" or \"English-language\" poets.\n\n**Careful Points and Further Explanation:**\n*   **The Pun:** Brodsky's choice is a form of sophisticated wordplay. He is using the poet's name as a nonce word to describe the boulevards. This might be a reference to \"sideburns\" (a term derived from General Burnside but also a feature of Robert Burns's portraits), which frame the face just as the wide avenues frame the urban vistas of Vienna.\n*   **Translation is Key:** The puzzle explicitly mentions the \"Russian translation.\" This is crucial because this specific wordplay exists in Brodsky's Russian version of the text and not necessarily in the original English.\n*   **\"English\" vs. \"Scottish\":** The question uses \"English poet.\" While Robert Burns was Scottish, he wrote in English as well as Scots and is a cornerstone of literature in the English language. This is a common and acceptable simplification in such questions.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBy tracing the clue to Joseph Brodsky's essay \"Journey to Istanbul,\" we find he uses the neologism \"Бернсы\" (Bernsy) to describe Vienna's avenues. This is derived from the surname \"Бернс\" (Berns), which is the Russian transliteration of \"Burns,\" the surname of the famous poet Robert Burns.\n\n<<<Burns>>>"
