    "### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Key Figures and Context:**\n    *   **Ming General Mu Sheng (沐晟):** A prominent general of the Chinese Ming Dynasty. He was involved in several campaigns in Vietnam (then known as Đại Việt or under Ming occupation as Jiaozhi/Giao Chỉ).\n    *   **\"First Major Defeat\":** This requires distinguishing between different campaigns. Mu Sheng participated in the initial successful Ming invasion (Ming-Hồ War, 1406-1407) which led to the conquest of Vietnam. Therefore, his \"first major defeat\" must have occurred during the subsequent Vietnamese rebellion against Ming rule. This was the Lam Sơn Uprising (1418–1427), led by Lê Lợi.\n\n2.  **Examine Mu Sheng's Role in the Lam Sơn Uprising:**\n    *   By 1426, the Lam Sơn rebellion had gained significant momentum. The Ming army under General Wang Tong (王通) suffered a catastrophic defeat at the Battle of Tốt Động – Chúc Động.\n    *   In response, the Ming Emperor sent two large relief armies in 1427 to crush the rebellion once and for all.\n    *   One army, led by Liu Sheng (柳升), advanced from Guangxi in the east.\n    *   The second army, led by **Mu Sheng**, advanced from Yunnan in the north/northwest.\n    *   Mu Sheng's defeat is part of this final, decisive campaign of the war.\n\n3.  **Pinpoint Mu Sheng's Defeat:**\n    *   Mu Sheng advanced his army from Yunnan along the Thao River (the upstream portion of the Red River). His goal was to converge with Liu Sheng's army to attack the Lam Sơn forces.\n    *   However, before Mu Sheng could engage in a major battle, he received news that Liu Sheng's entire army had been completely annihilated at the Battle of Chi Lăng – Xương Giang.\n    *   Upon hearing of this disaster, Mu Sheng and his forces lost their morale and decided to retreat back to Yunnan.\n    *   The Vietnamese commanders Phạm Văn Xảo and Trịnh Khả anticipated this move. They pursued Mu Sheng's retreating army and set up an ambush at a strategic point.\n\n4.  **Identify the Location of the Defeat:**\n    *   The decisive ambush and rout of Mu Sheng's army occurred at the pass of **Lãnh Câu** (隘冷勾) and **Đan Xá** (丹舍), along the Thao River.\n    *   The Vietnamese forces attacked ferociously, inflicting heavy casualties on the panicked Ming army. Mu Sheng barely escaped with his life, abandoning a vast amount of supplies, weapons, and even his official seal. This was an undeniable and major defeat.\n    *   Mapping these historical locations to modern geography, the battle sites of Lãnh Câu and Đan Xá, along the Thao River where Mu Sheng's army was routed, are located in the territory of the present-day **Yên Bái province**.\n\n### Careful Points to Note:\n\n*   **Distinguishing Defeats:** It's crucial not to confuse Mu Sheng's defeat with other major Ming defeats in the same war. The defeat at Tốt Động – Chúc Động was suffered by Wang Tong. The defeat at Chi Lăng was suffered by Liu Sheng. Mu Sheng's defeat happened *after* he learned of Liu Sheng's demise, during his own army's retreat.\n*   **Defining \"First Major Defeat\":** While Mu Sheng was a seasoned general, his campaign in 1427 against the Lam Sơn rebels ended in his first conclusive and large-scale military disaster in Vietnam. The earlier 1406-1407 campaign he co-led was a victory.\n*   **Geographical Accuracy:** The path of retreat from the Red River Delta area back to Yunnan along the Thao River places the key battlegrounds squarely within the modern borders of Yên Bái province.\n\n### Final Conclusion:\n\nThe historical events indicate that Ming General Mu Sheng's army advanced from Yunnan along the Thao River, and upon hearing of another Ming army's destruction, was forced into a disastrous retreat. This retreat was ambushed and his army was shattered at Lãnh Câu Pass, which is located in modern-day Yên Bái Province.\n\n<<<Yên Bái province>>>"
