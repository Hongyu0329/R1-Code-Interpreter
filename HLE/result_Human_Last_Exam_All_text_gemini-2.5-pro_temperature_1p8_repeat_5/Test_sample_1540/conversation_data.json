    "Answering this question requires finding the C program that solves the problem using the least amount of memory for its variables and then calculating that total memory usage in bytes.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understanding the Core Task:** The goal is to compare two strings lexicographically, ignoring the case of the letters. The strings are guaranteed to have the same length. The output should be -1, 1, or 0.\n\n2.  **Initial (Standard) Approach:** A straightforward method is to read both strings into two character arrays and then loop through them, comparing characters at each position after converting them to a common case (e.g., lowercase).\n    *   `char s1[101];` (100 chars + 1 null terminator) -> 101 bytes\n    *   `char s2[101];` -> 101 bytes\n    *   `int i;` (for loop index) -> 4 bytes (on a typical system)\n    *   Total memory: 101 + 101 + 4 = 206 bytes.\n\n3.  **Optimizing for Memory:** The question asks for the *most memory-efficient* solution. We must analyze if we can reduce the memory usage from the standard approach.\n    *   The most significant memory usage comes from the two string buffers (`s1` and `s2`).\n    *   Can we avoid storing both strings? To compare `s1[i]` and `s2[i]`, we need both characters at the same time. Since input is read sequentially from standard input (e.g., the first string is read completely, then the second), we cannot access `s2[i]` until after `s1` has been fully processed. This means we *must* store the first string in memory to refer back to its characters.\n    *   However, we can avoid storing the *second* string. We can read the first string into a buffer, and then, as we iterate through the buffered first string, we can read the second string one character at a time from the input stream.\n\n4.  **Developing the Memory-Efficient Algorithm:**\n    a.  Declare a character array to hold the first string. Its size must be 101 to accommodate the maximum length of 100 characters plus the null terminator.\n    b.  Read the first string from the input into this array.\n    c.  Declare a loop counter to iterate through the first string.\n    d.  Declare a single `char` variable to hold one character from the second string.\n    e.  Loop from the start to the end of the buffered first string. In each iteration:\n        i.  Read a single character from the input stream. This will be the corresponding character from the second string.\n        ii. Perform a case-insensitive comparison between the character from the buffered first string and the newly read character from the second string.\n        iii. If they are not equal, print -1 or 1 accordingly and terminate the program.\n    f.  If the loop completes without finding any differences, the strings are equal. Print 0.\n\n### Listing Careful Points and Calculating Memory\n\nTo find the absolute minimum memory, we must choose the smallest possible data type for each variable.\n\n*   **Variable 1: Buffer for the first string.**\n    *   Purpose: To store the first input string.\n    *   Requirement: Max 100 characters + 1 null terminator (`\\0`).\n    *   Data Type: `char s1[101];`\n    *   Memory Usage: `101 * sizeof(char)` = `101 * 1` = **101 bytes**.\n\n*   **Variable 2: Loop Index.**\n    *   Purpose: To iterate through the string, from index 0 up to 99.\n    *   Requirement: A variable that can hold integer values from 0 to 100.\n    *   Data Type: An `int` (4 bytes) is standard but wasteful. The smallest standard integer type that can hold values in the range [0, 100] is `unsigned char` (range 0-255).\n    *   Memory Usage: `sizeof(unsigned char)` = **1 byte**.\n\n*   **Variable 3: Character from the second string.**\n    *   Purpose: To temporarily store a single character read from the second string for comparison.\n    *   Requirement: A variable to hold a single character value.\n    *   Data Type: `char`. The function `getchar()` returns an `int` to handle the special `EOF` value, but since the problem guarantees valid character input of a specific length, it's safe to store the result directly into a `char`, ignoring the possibility of `EOF`.\n    *   Memory Usage: `sizeof(char)` = **1 byte**.\n\n### Final Memory Calculation\n\nThe total memory `m` used by the variables in the most memory-efficient C program is the sum of the memory used by these three variables.\n\n`m = (memory for string buffer) + (memory for loop index) + (memory for single character)`\n`m = 101 + 1 + 1`\n`m = 103` bytes.\n\n<<<103>>>"
