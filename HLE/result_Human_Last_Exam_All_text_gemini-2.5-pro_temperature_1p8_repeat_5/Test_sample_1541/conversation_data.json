    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the most memory-efficient solution and calculate the memory used.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understanding the Goal:** The primary task is to reorder the numbers in a given sum (e.g., \"3+2+1+4+1\") so that they appear in non-decreasing order (e.g., \"1+1+2+3+4\"). A critical constraint is to devise a C program that achieves this using the minimum possible amount of memory for its variables, and then to calculate this minimum memory usage, `m`, in bytes.\n\n2.  **Analyzing Constraints and Input/Output:**\n    *   **Input:** A string containing a sum of numbers. The numbers are guaranteed to be one of '1', '2', '3', or '4'. The string is syntactically correct and has a maximum length of 1000 characters.\n    *   **Output:** A string representing the same sum with the numbers sorted.\n    *   **Key Challenge:** Memory efficiency.\n\n3.  **Devising a Memory-Efficient Strategy:**\n    *   A naive approach would be to read the entire string into a character array (`char s[1001]`), extract the numbers into an integer array (`int nums[501]`), sort it, and then print. This would use over 1500 bytes of memory, which is not optimal.\n    *   A much better strategy, given that the numbers are from a very limited set {1, 2, 3, 4}, is **Counting Sort**. This method avoids storing the individual numbers altogether. Instead, we just count the occurrences of each number.\n    *   **Phase 1: Counting:** We can process the input string character by character without storing the whole string. A `getchar()` loop is perfect for this. We will maintain four counters, one for each possible number ('1', '2', '3', '4').\n    *   **Phase 2: Printing:** After counting, we can construct the output string by first printing the required number of '1's, then '2's, and so on. We must be careful to print the '+' separator only between numbers. A simple flag can manage this logic efficiently.\n\n### Listing Careful Points and Calculating Memory\n\nTo find the absolute minimum memory, we must choose the smallest possible standard C data type for each variable.\n\n1.  **Counters for Numbers:**\n    *   We need to count the occurrences of '1', '2', '3', and '4'.\n    *   The input string has a maximum length of 1000. The maximum number of terms is `(1000 + 1) / 2 = 500.5`, so at most 501 numbers. A single counter could potentially need to hold a value up to 501.\n    *   A `char` type (1 byte, max value 127 or 255) is too small.\n    *   An `int` type (4 bytes) would work, but is not the most memory-efficient.\n    *   A `short int` type (2 bytes, max value 32,767) is sufficient and is the most memory-efficient standard type for this purpose.\n    *   **Variables:** `short count1, count2, count3, count4;`\n    *   **Memory:** `4 * sizeof(short) = 4 * 2 = 8` bytes.\n\n2.  **Input Character Variable:**\n    *   To read the input one character at a time using `getchar()`, we need a variable to store the character.\n    *   **Variable:** `char c;`\n    *   **Memory:** `sizeof(char) = 1` byte.\n\n3.  **Loop Counter:**\n    *   We need a loop variable to print the numbers based on their counts. This loop will iterate at most 501 times.\n    *   A `short int` (2 bytes) is sufficient for a loop counter that goes up to 501.\n    *   **Variable:** `short i;`\n    *   **Memory:** `sizeof(short) = 2` bytes.\n\n4.  **Separator Flag:**\n    *   To correctly print the '+' symbol only between numbers, we need a flag to track whether we are about to print the very first term.\n    *   A boolean-like flag only needs to store two states (0 or 1). A `char` is the most memory-efficient type for this.\n    *   **Variable:** `char is_first_term = 1;`\n    *   **Memory:** `sizeof(char) = 1` byte.\n\n### Final Calculation of Total Memory (m)\n\nSumming the memory usage for all the variables required for the most memory-efficient implementation:\n\n*   Counters (4 `short` variables): 8 bytes\n*   Input character (1 `char` variable): 1 byte\n*   Loop counter (1 `short` variable): 2 bytes\n*   Separator flag (1 `char` variable): 1 byte\n*   **Total Memory (m):** `8 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 12` bytes.\n\n<<<12>>>"
