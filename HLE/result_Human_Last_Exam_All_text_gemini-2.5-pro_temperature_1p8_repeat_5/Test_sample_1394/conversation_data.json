    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the solution to the differential equation.\n\n**Step 1: Rearrange the equation**\nThe given differential equation is:\n$x^{2} y^{2}=x^{3} y \\frac{d y}{d x}+y^{2}\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)^{2}+x y\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)+9 x^{2}$\n\nLet $p = \\frac{dy}{dx}$. We can rewrite the equation as:\n$x^{2} y^{2} - 9 x^{2} = y^{2} p^{2} + (x^{3} y + xy) p$\n$x^2(y^2-9) = y^2 p^2 + xy(x^2+1) p$\n\nLet's move all terms to one side to form a quadratic equation in $p$:\n$y^2 p^2 + xy(x^2+1)p + x^2(9-y^2) = 0$\n\n**Step 2: Attempt to solve for p using the quadratic formula**\nWe can solve for $p$ using the quadratic formula $p = \\frac{-B \\pm \\sqrt{B^2-4AC}}{2A}$, where:\n$A = y^2$\n$B = xy(x^2+1)$\n$C = x^2(9-y^2)$\n\nThe discriminant is $\\Delta = B^2-4AC$:\n$\\Delta = (xy(x^2+1))^2 - 4(y^2)(x^2(9-y^2))$\n$\\Delta = x^2y^2(x^2+1)^2 - 4x^2y^2(9-y^2)$\n$\\Delta = x^2y^2[(x^2+1)^2 - 4(9-y^2)]$\n$\\Delta = x^2y^2[x^4 + 2x^2 + 1 - 36 + 4y^2]$\n$\\Delta = x^2y^2[x^4 + 2x^2 + 4y^2 - 35]$\n\nSince the term in the bracket, $x^4 + 2x^2 + 4y^2 - 35$, is not a perfect square of a polynomial in $x$ and $y$, solving for $p$ directly would lead to a very complicated differential equation. This suggests that we should try a different approach, likely a substitution.\n\n**Step 3: Introduce a substitution**\nNotice the frequent appearance of terms like $y \\frac{dy}{dx}$ and $y^2$. This suggests the substitution $u = y^2$.\nDifferentiating $u$ with respect to $x$, we get $\\frac{du}{dx} = 2y \\frac{dy}{dx}$.\nSo, $y \\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{du}{dx}$.\nAnd $(\\frac{dy}{dx})^2 = \\left(\\frac{1}{2y}\\frac{du}{dx}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{4y^2}\\left(\\frac{du}{dx}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{4u}\\left(\\frac{du}{dx}\\right)^2$.\n\nSubstitute these into the original equation:\n$x^2 u = x^3 \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{du}{dx}\\right) + u \\left(\\frac{1}{4u}\\left(\\frac{du}{dx}\\right)^2\\right) + x \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{du}{dx}\\right) + 9x^2$\n$x^2 u = \\frac{x^3}{2}\\frac{du}{dx} + \\frac{1}{4}\\left(\\frac{du}{dx}\\right)^2 + \\frac{x}{2}\\frac{du}{dx} + 9x^2$\n\nMultiply by 4 to clear the denominators:\n$4x^2 u = 2x^3\\frac{du}{dx} + \\left(\\frac{du}{dx}\\right)^2 + 2x\\frac{du}{dx} + 36x^2$\n\nRearrange into a quadratic equation for $\\frac{du}{dx}$:\n$\\left(\\frac{du}{dx}\\right)^2 + 2x(x^2+1)\\frac{du}{dx} + (36x^2 - 4x^2u) = 0$\n\nSolving for $\\frac{du}{dx}$ using the quadratic formula:\n$\\frac{du}{dx} = \\frac{-2x(x^2+1) \\pm \\sqrt{(2x(x^2+1))^2 - 4(1)(36x^2 - 4x^2u)}}{2}$\n$\\frac{du}{dx} = -x(x^2+1) \\pm \\sqrt{x^2(x^2+1)^2 - (36x^2 - 4x^2u)}$\n$\\frac{du}{dx} = -x(x^2+1) \\pm \\sqrt{x^2(x^4+2x^2+1) - 36x^2 + 4x^2u}$\n$\\frac{du}{dx} = -x(x^2+1) \\pm \\sqrt{x^4+2x^2+1-36+4u} \\cdot x$\n$\\frac{du}{dx} = -x(x^2+1) \\pm x\\sqrt{x^4+2x^2-35+4u}$\n\n**Step 4: Solve the differential equation for u**\nThe equation is of the form $\\frac{du}{dx} = f(x) \\pm g(x)\\sqrt{h(x)+ku}$. This structure suggests another substitution.\nLet $v^2 = x^4+2x^2-35+4u$.\nDifferentiating with respect to $x$:\n$2v \\frac{dv}{dx} = 4x^3+4x+4\\frac{du}{dx}$\n$\\frac{du}{dx} = \\frac{1}{4}(2v \\frac{dv}{dx} - 4x^3-4x) = \\frac{v}{2}\\frac{dv}{dx} - (x^3+x)$\n\nSubstitute this expression for $\\frac{du}{dx}$ into the equation from Step 3:\n$\\frac{v}{2}\\frac{dv}{dx} - (x^3+x) = -x(x^2+1) \\pm x\\sqrt{v^2}$\n$\\frac{v}{2}\\frac{dv}{dx} - (x^3+x) = -(x^3+x) \\pm xv$\n\nThe term $-(x^3+x)$ cancels out on both sides:\n$\\frac{v}{2}\\frac{dv}{dx} = \\pm xv$\n\nThis gives two possibilities:\n1. $v=0$: This leads to a singular solution.\n   $v^2 = x^4+2x^2-35+4u = 0 \\implies 4u = 35-2x^2-x^4$.\n   Substituting $u=y^2$, we get $4y^2 = 35-2x^2-x^4$.\n\n2. $\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{dv}{dx} = \\pm x$: This leads to the general solution.\n   $\\frac{dv}{dx} = \\pm 2x$\n   Integrating with respect to $x$ gives:\n   $v = \\pm x^2 + c$, where $c$ is an arbitrary integration constant.\n\nNow, substitute back $v^2 = ( \\pm x^2+c)^2 = x^4 \\pm 2cx^2+c^2$.\nEquating the two expressions for $v^2$:\n$x^4 \\pm 2cx^2+c^2 = x^4+2x^2-35+4u$\n$4u = (\\pm 2c - 2)x^2 + c^2+35$\n\nThe two cases $(\\pm 2c-2)$ can be represented by a single family of solutions by allowing the constant to be positive or negative. Let's redefine the constant. Let a new constant $C$ cover all cases.\n$4u = (2C-2)x^2 + C^2+35$\n\n**Step 5: Write the general solution**\nSubstitute back $u=y^2$:\n$4y^2 = (2C-2)x^2 + C^2+35$\n\nThis is the general solution in an implicit form relating $x$, $y$, and an arbitrary constant $C$. We can also express this relation as a quadratic in $C$:\n$C^2 + 2Cx^2 - 2x^2 - 4y^2 + 35 = 0$.\n\nAnother elegant way to write the solution is by using the relation $v=\\pm x^2+C$. Let's go back to $c+x^2=\\pm v$. Squaring gives $(c+x^2)^2 = v^2$.\nSubstituting $v^2=x^4+2x^2-35+4y^2$:\n$(C+x^2)^2 = x^4+2x^2-35+4y^2$.\n$C^2+2Cx^2+x^4 = x^4+2x^2+4y^2-35$.\n$C^2+2Cx^2-2x^2-4y^2+35=0$, which is the same implicit solution.\n\nWe can also check the singular solutions. We found $y=\\pm 3$ by inspection early on. In the general solution $4y^2 = (2C-2)x^2 + C^2+35$, if we set the coefficient of $x^2$ to zero, $2C-2=0 \\implies C=1$. Then the equation becomes $4y^2 = 0 + 1^2+35 = 36$, which gives $y^2=9$, so $y=\\pm 3$. Thus, these are particular solutions belonging to the general family. The other singular solution, $4y^2 = 35-2x^2-x^4$, can be found as the envelope of the family of general solutions.\n\nThe final answer is the implicit general solution."
