    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of each word to determine which one has not undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n**1. Understanding Trisyllabic Laxing (TSL)**\n\nTrisyllabic laxing is a historical sound change in English that has two primary conditions:\n*   **The Vowel:** A tense (long) vowel or diphthong gets shortened (becomes lax).\n*   **The Position:** This vowel must be in the antepenultimate syllable, which is the third syllable from the end of a word. This means the rule applies to words with three or more syllables.\n\nLet's examine each word based on these criteria.\n\n**2. Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n*   **southern:**\n    *   **Base Word:** *south* /saʊθ/. This word contains a long vowel/diphthong (/aʊ/) which evolved from a long vowel in Old English (*sūþ*).\n    *   **Derived Word:** *southern* /ˈsʌðərn/. The vowel has shortened to /ʌ/.\n    *   **Syllable Count:** The word *southern* has two syllables (south-ern).\n    *   **Analysis:** Although the vowel was historically long and is now short, the shortening did not occur because of trisyllabic laxing, as the word only has two syllables. It fails the position requirement.\n\n*   **derivative:**\n    *   **Base Word:** *derive* /dɪˈraɪv/. This word contains the long diphthong /aɪ/.\n    *   **Derived Word:** *derivative* /dɪˈrɪvətɪv/. The vowel sound has shortened to /ɪ/.\n    *   **Syllable Count:** The word *derivative* has four syllables (de-riv-a-tive). The vowel in question is in the second syllable (-riv-), which is the antepenultimate (third-from-last) syllable.\n    *   **Analysis:** A long vowel (/aɪ/) became short (/ɪ/) in the antepenultimate syllable. This is a classic example of trisyllabic laxing.\n\n*   **serenity:**\n    *   **Base Word:** *serene* /səˈriːn/. This word contains the long vowel /iː/.\n    *   **Derived Word:** *serenity* /səˈrɛnəti/. The vowel sound has shortened to /ɛ/.\n    *   **Syllable Count:** The word *serenity* has four syllables (se-ren-i-ty). The vowel in question is in the second syllable (-ren-), which is the antepenultimate syllable.\n    *   **Analysis:** A long vowel (/iː/) became short (/ɛ/) in the antepenultimate syllable. This is another clear case of trisyllabic laxing.\n\n*   **pleasant:**\n    *   **Base Word:** *please* /pliːz/. This word contains the long vowel /iː/.\n    *   **Derived Word:** *pleasant* /ˈplɛzənt/. The vowel has shortened to /ɛ/.\n    *   **Syllable Count:** The word *pleasant* has two syllables (pleas-ant).\n    *   **Analysis:** Like *southern*, the vowel was shortened, but it did not undergo trisyllabic laxing because the word is not trisyllabic. It fails the position requirement.\n\n*   **gratitude:**\n    *   **Related Word:** *grateful* /ˈɡreɪtfʊl/. This word contains the long diphthong /eɪ/.\n    *   **Word:** *gratitude* /ˈɡrætɪtjuːd/. The vowel sound has shortened to /æ/.\n    *   **Syllable Count:** The word *gratitude* has three syllables (grat-i-tude). The vowel in question is in the first syllable (grat-), which is the antepenultimate syllable.\n    *   **Analysis:** A long vowel (/eɪ/ in related forms) became short (/æ/) in the antepenultimate syllable. This is a case of trisyllabic laxing.\n\n*   **shadow:**\n    *   **Etymology:** The word comes from Old English *sceadu*. The first vowel (/æ/ sound) was historically short.\n    *   **Word:** *shadow* /ˈʃædoʊ/. The first vowel is still the short /æ/.\n    *   **Syllable Count:** The word *shadow* has two syllables (shad-ow).\n    *   **Analysis:** This word fails the conditions for trisyllabic laxing on two counts. First, it only has two syllables, so it does not have an antepenultimate syllable. Second, and more importantly, the vowel in its first syllable was never long in its history, so it could not have been shortened (laxed).\n\n**3. Conclusion**\n\nWhile *southern* and *pleasant* did not undergo *trisyllabic* laxing due to syllable count, they did undergo a form of vowel shortening. *Shadow* is the most definitive answer because not only does it fail the syllable-count rule, but its relevant vowel was never long to begin with, meaning no laxing (shortening) process could have occurred.\n\n<<<shadow>>>"
