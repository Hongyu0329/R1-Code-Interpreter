No, it is not possible. The scaling argument (a variant of Derrick's theorem) shows that any localized soliton configuration would be energetically unstable with respect to changes in its size. The energy functional for a scaled soliton of size $\lambda$ takes the form $E(\lambda) = c_1\lambda + c_2\lambda^2$, where $c_1$ (from exchange) is positive and $c_2$ (from DMI) can be positive or negative. This function does not have a stable minimum for $\lambda>0$. An additional energy term, such as a Zeeman or anisotropy term, is required for stabilization.
