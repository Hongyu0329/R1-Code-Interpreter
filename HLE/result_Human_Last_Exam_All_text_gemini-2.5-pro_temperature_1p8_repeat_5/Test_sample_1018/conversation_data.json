    "To compute the simplicial volume of the product of two oriented closed surfaces, $\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}$, we will follow a step-by-step approach based on the known properties of simplicial volume.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Manifolds:**\n    *   $\\Sigma_g$ represents an oriented, closed surface of genus $g$.\n    *   We are given two such surfaces: $M_1 = \\Sigma_{31}$ (genus $g_1=31$) and $M_2 = \\Sigma_{17}$ (genus $g_2=17$).\n    *   Both are 2-dimensional manifolds. Their product, $\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}$, is a 4-dimensional manifold.\n\n2.  **Recall the Formula for the Simplicial Volume of a Surface:**\n    The simplicial volume of an oriented, closed surface $\\Sigma_g$ is directly related to its Euler characteristic, $\\chi(\\Sigma_g) = 2-2g$. The formula is:\n    $\\|\\Sigma_g\\| = 2|\\chi(\\Sigma_g)| = 2|2-2g|$\n    Since the simplicial volume must be non-negative, and for $g \\ge 1$, $2-2g$ is non-positive, this simplifies to:\n    $\\|\\Sigma_g\\| = 2(2g-2) = 4g-4$ for $g \\ge 1$.\n    *   For $g=0$ (the sphere $S^2$), $\\|\\Sigma_0\\| = 0$.\n    *   For $g=1$ (the torus $T^2$), $\\|\\Sigma_1\\| = 0$.\n    *   For $g \\ge 2$, $\\|\\Sigma_g\\| = 4g-4$. This is a positive value, which corresponds to the fact that these surfaces are hyperbolic.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Simplicial Volume of each Surface:**\n    *   For $\\Sigma_{31}$, the genus is $g_1=31$. Since $31 \\ge 2$, we can use the formula:\n        $\\|\\Sigma_{31}\\| = 4(31) - 4 = 124 - 4 = 120$.\n    *   For $\\Sigma_{17}$, the genus is $g_2=17$. Since $17 \\ge 2$, we can use the formula:\n        $\\|\\Sigma_{17}\\| = 4(17) - 4 = 68 - 4 = 64$.\n\n4.  **Recall the Product Formula for Simplicial Volume:**\n    According to a theorem by Gromov, for two closed, oriented manifolds $M$ (of dimension $m$) and $N$ (of dimension $n$), the simplicial volume of their product is given by:\n    $\\|M \\times N\\| = \\binom{m+n}{m} \\|M\\| \\cdot \\|N\\|$\n    This formula holds when $\\|M\\|$ and $\\|N\\|$ are both non-zero. If either is zero, the product's simplicial volume is also zero.\n\n5.  **Apply the Product Formula to our Problem:**\n    *   $M = \\Sigma_{31}$, with dimension $m=2$ and $\\|\\Sigma_{31}\\| = 120$.\n    *   $N = \\Sigma_{17}$, with dimension $n=2$ and $\\|\\Sigma_{17}\\| = 64$.\n    *   The total dimension is $m+n = 2+2=4$.\n    *   First, we need the binomial coefficient:\n        $\\binom{m+n}{m} = \\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = \\frac{4 \\times 3}{2 \\times 1} = 6$.\n    *   Now, we substitute all the values into the product formula:\n        $\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = \\binom{4}{2} \\cdot \\|\\Sigma_{31}\\| \\cdot \\|\\Sigma_{17}\\|$\n        $\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = 6 \\cdot 120 \\cdot 64$.\n\n6.  **Perform the Final Calculation:**\n    *   $6 \\times 120 = 720$.\n    *   $720 \\times 64 = 46080$.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Conditions for Formulas:** It is crucial to verify that the conditions for the formulas are met. For the surface formula $\\|\\Sigma_g\\| = 4g-4$, we need $g \\ge 2$, which is true for both $g=31$ and $g=17$. For the product formula, the manifolds must be closed and oriented, which is given, and the individual simplicial volumes should be non-zero for the formula to be non-trivial, which we have verified ($120 \\neq 0$ and $64 \\neq 0$).\n*   **Binomial Coefficient:** The coefficient $\\binom{m+n}{m}$ depends on the dimensions of the factor manifolds. In this case, both are surfaces of dimension 2.\n*   **Arithmetic:** Ensure the final multiplication is carried out correctly.\n\nThe calculation is straightforward application of established theorems.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe simplicial volume of $\\Sigma_{31}$ is $\\|\\Sigma_{31}\\| = 4(31) - 4 = 120$.\nThe simplicial volume of $\\Sigma_{17}$ is $\\|\\Sigma_{17}\\| = 4(17) - 4 = 64$.\nThe dimension of both surfaces is 2. The product formula for simplicial volume states $\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = \\binom{2+2}{2} \\|\\Sigma_{31}\\| \\|\\Sigma_{17}\\|$.\nThe computation is:\n$\\binom{4}{2} \\times 120 \\times 64 = 6 \\times 120 \\times 64 = 720 \\times 64 = 46080$.\n\n<<<46080>>>"
