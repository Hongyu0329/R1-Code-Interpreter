    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the solubility of Al(OH)₃ in pure water.\n\n**1. Identify All Relevant Chemical Equilibria and Species**\n\nWhen aluminum hydroxide, Al(OH)₃, is added to pure water, it dissolves and participates in multiple simultaneous equilibria.\nThe main species in solution will be the aluminum ions Al³⁺, the complex ion Al(OH)₄⁻, and the ions from water autoionization, H⁺ and OH⁻.\n\nThe equilibria are:\n*   **Dissolution of Al(OH)₃:**\n    Al(OH)₃(s) ⇌ Al³⁺(aq) + 3OH⁻(aq)\n    Equilibrium constant (solubility product): K_sp = [Al³⁺][OH⁻]³ = 5.3 x 10⁻²⁷\n\n*   **Formation of the hydroxo complex:**\n    Al³⁺(aq) + 4OH⁻(aq) ⇌ Al(OH)₄⁻(aq)\n    Equilibrium constant (formation constant): K_f = [Al(OH)₄⁻] / ([Al³⁺][OH⁻]⁴) = 1.1 x 10³¹\n\n*   **Autoionization of water:**\n    H₂O(l) ⇌ H⁺(aq) + OH⁻(aq)\n    Equilibrium constant: K_w = [H⁺][OH⁻] = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴\n\n**2. Define Molar Solubility (S)**\n\nThe molar solubility (S) of Al(OH)₃ is the total concentration of all dissolved aluminum-containing species at equilibrium.\nS = [Al³⁺] + [Al(OH)₄⁻]\n\n**3. Establish a System of Equations**\n\nTo solve for S, we need to find the equilibrium concentrations of [Al³⁺] and [Al(OH)₄⁻]. The most reliable method is to use the principle of charge neutrality. The solution must have a net charge of zero.\n\n*   **Charge Balance Equation:**\n    The sum of the positive charges must equal the sum of the negative charges.\n    3[Al³⁺] + [H⁺] = [Al(OH)₄⁻] + [OH⁻]\n\n*   **Express concentrations in terms of a single variable:**\n    It is convenient to express all concentrations in terms of [OH⁻]. Let's call [OH⁻] = x.\n\n    a) From the K_w expression:\n       [H⁺] = K_w / [OH⁻] = K_w / x\n\n    b) From the K_sp expression:\n       [Al³⁺] = K_sp / [OH⁻]³ = K_sp / x³\n\n    c) To find [Al(OH)₄⁻], we can combine the K_sp and K_f expressions:\n       From K_f: [Al(OH)₄⁻] = K_f * [Al³⁺] * [OH⁻]⁴\n       Substitute the expression for [Al³⁺] from step (b):\n       [Al(OH)₄⁻] = K_f * (K_sp / x³) * x⁴ = K_sp * K_f * x\n\n**4. Solve for the Equilibrium Hydroxide Concentration, [OH⁻]**\n\nNow substitute the expressions for [H⁺], [Al³⁺], and [Al(OH)₄⁻] into the charge balance equation:\n\n3 * (K_sp / x³) + (K_w / x) = (K_sp * K_f * x) + x\n\nPlug in the numerical values for the constants:\nK_sp = 5.3 x 10⁻²⁷\nK_f = 1.1 x 10³¹\nK_w = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴\nK_sp * K_f = (5.3 x 10⁻²⁷) * (1.1 x 10³¹) = 5.83 x 10⁴\n\n3 * (5.3 x 10⁻²⁷ / x³) + (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴ / x) = (5.83 x 10⁴ * x) + x\n1.59 x 10⁻²⁶ / x³ + 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴ / x = (5.83 x 10⁴ + 1) * x\n\nSince 5.83 x 10⁴ is much larger than 1, we can approximate the right side as 5.83 x 10⁴ * x.\n1.59 x 10⁻²⁶ / x³ + 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴ / x ≈ 5.83 x 10⁴ * x\n\nMultiply the entire equation by x³ to eliminate the denominators:\n1.59 x 10⁻²⁶ + (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) * x² = (5.83 x 10⁴) * x⁴\n\nRearrange this into a standard quadratic form for x² by letting y = x²:\n(5.83 x 10⁴) * y² - (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) * y - 1.59 x 10⁻²⁶ = 0\n\nSolve for y using the quadratic formula y = [-b ± sqrt(b²-4ac)] / 2a:\ny = [ -(-1.0x10⁻¹⁴) ± sqrt((-1.0x10⁻¹⁴)² - 4(5.83x10⁴)(-1.59x10⁻²⁶)) ] / (2 * 5.83x10⁴)\ny = [ 1.0x10⁻¹⁴ ± sqrt(1.0x10⁻²⁸ + 3.71x10⁻²¹) ] / (1.166x10⁵)\n\nThe term 1.0x10⁻²⁸ is negligible compared to 3.71x10⁻²¹. Since y=x²=[OH⁻]² must be positive, we take the positive root:\ny ≈ [ 1.0x10⁻¹⁴ + sqrt(3.71x10⁻²¹) ] / (1.166x10⁵)\ny ≈ [ 1.0x10⁻¹⁴ + 6.09x10⁻¹¹ ] / (1.166x10⁵)\ny ≈ (6.09x10⁻¹¹) / (1.166x10⁵)\ny ≈ 5.22 x 10⁻¹⁶\n\nNow, solve for x = [OH⁻]:\nx² = 5.22 x 10⁻¹⁶\nx = sqrt(5.22 x 10⁻¹⁶) = 2.28 x 10⁻⁸ M\nSo, the equilibrium [OH⁻] is 2.28 x 10⁻⁸ mol L⁻¹.\n\n**5. Calculate Equilibrium Concentrations of Aluminum Species**\n\nUse the value of [OH⁻] to find the concentrations of the two aluminum species:\n\n*   [Al³⁺] = K_sp / [OH⁻]³ = (5.3 x 10⁻²⁷) / (2.28 x 10⁻⁸)³\n    [Al³⁺] ≈ (5.3 x 10⁻²⁷) / (1.185 x 10⁻²³) ≈ 4.47 x 10⁻⁴ mol L⁻¹\n\n*   [Al(OH)₄⁻] = K_sp * K_f * [OH⁻] = (5.83 x 10⁴) * (2.28 x 10⁻⁸)\n    [Al(OH)₄⁻] ≈ 1.33 x 10⁻³ mol L⁻¹\n\n**6. Determine the Molar Solubility (S)**\n\nFinally, calculate the total solubility by summing the concentrations of the aluminum species:\nS = [Al³⁺] + [Al(OH)₄⁻]\nS ≈ (4.47 x 10⁻⁴) + (1.33 x 10⁻³)\nS ≈ 0.000447 + 0.00133\nS ≈ 0.001777 mol L⁻¹\nS ≈ 1.78 x 10⁻³ mol L⁻¹\n\nRounding to two significant figures, consistent with the given constants:\nS = 1.8 x 10⁻³ mol L⁻¹\n\n<<<1.8*10^(-3)>>>"
