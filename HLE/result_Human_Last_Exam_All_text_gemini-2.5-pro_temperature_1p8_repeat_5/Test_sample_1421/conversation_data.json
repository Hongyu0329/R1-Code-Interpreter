    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Analysis of the Question\n\n1.  **Core Object:** The question asks for the formula for the **fermionic partition function, Z**. In statistical mechanics, the grand canonical partition function is defined as Z = Tr(e⁻ᵝᴴ'), where ᴴ' = H - µN is the grand canonical Hamiltonian, β = 1/(k_B T) is the inverse temperature, H is the Hamiltonian, µ is the chemical potential, and N is the particle number operator.\n2.  **Framework:** The formula must be expressed using **Feynman's path integral formalism**. This approach reformulates quantum mechanics and statistical mechanics not in terms of operators acting on states, but as a sum (or functional integral) over all possible \"histories\" or \"paths\" of a system.\n3.  **Representation:** The specific representation required is the **imaginary time representation**. This is a mathematical technique where real time, t, is analytically continued to imaginary time, τ = it/ħ. This formalism provides a direct bridge between the quantum mechanical time evolution operator, e⁻ⁱᴴᵗ/ħ, and the statistical mechanical Boltzmann factor, e⁻ᵝᴴ, by setting τ = ħβ.\n4.  **Key Challenge (Fermions):** The particles are **fermions**. Unlike bosons, fermions obey the Pauli exclusion principle, which stems from the antisymmetry of their many-body wavefunction under particle exchange. In the path integral formalism, this fundamental property requires the use of anti-commuting numbers known as **Grassmann variables**, rather than ordinary commuting numbers (c-numbers).\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Grassmann Variables:** The fields representing fermions, typically denoted as ψ(x,τ) and its conjugate ψ̄(x,τ), are not ordinary functions. They are fields of Grassmann numbers. These numbers have the defining anti-commutation property: ψ_i ψ_j = -ψ_j ψ_i. This also implies that ψ_i² = 0, which is the path integral's manifestation of the Pauli exclusion principle (two fermions cannot occupy the same state).\n2.  **Anti-Periodic Boundary Conditions:** A crucial consequence of using fermion statistics within the trace (Tr) operation is the boundary condition on the fields in imaginary time. While bosonic fields are periodic over the interval [0, ħβ], fermionic fields must be **anti-periodic**.\n    *   **ψ(x, τ = 0) = -ψ(x, τ = ħβ)**\n    *   **ψ̄(x, τ = 0) = -ψ̄(x, τ = ħβ)**\n    This arises from the anti-commutation of fermion creation/annihilation operators when evaluating the trace in the fermionic coherent state basis.\n3.  **The Action (S):** The \"weight\" of each path in the integral is given by e⁻ˢ, where S is the **Euclidean action**. The action is the integral of the Euclidean Lagrangian (L_E) over the imaginary time interval and over all spatial dimensions.\n    *   S = ∫₀ʰᵝ dτ ∫ dᵈx L_E(ψ̄, ψ)\n4.  **Functional Integral Measure:** The \"sum over all paths\" is formally written as a functional integral with a measure D[ψ̄]D[ψ]. This symbolizes an integration over all possible configurations of the Grassmann fields ψ̄(x,τ) and ψ(x,τ) that satisfy the anti-periodic boundary conditions.\n\n### Step-by-Step Derivation of the Final Formula\n\n1.  **Start with the Definition:** The grand canonical partition function is Z = Tr[e⁻ᵝ(H-µN)]. For simplicity, we denote the operator H - µN as just H in the following steps.\n2.  **Introduce Path Integrals:** The trace of the operator e⁻ᵝᴴ is expressed as a functional integral over fields. The transition from an operator formalism to a field integral formalism for fermions necessitates the use of fermionic coherent states and their associated Grassmann variables.\n3.  **Define the Integrand:** The path integral takes the form of an integral over all possible field histories, weighted by the factor e⁻ˢ, where S is the Euclidean action corresponding to the Hamiltonian H.\n4.  **Construct the Euclidean Action (S):** The Euclidean action S is obtained from the original Lagrangian via a Wick rotation (t → -iτ). For a standard non-relativistic fermion system, the Hamiltonian operator might be H = ∫ dᵈx ψ̂†(x) [-ħ²∇²/(2m) - µ] ψ̂(x) + V_int, where ψ̂† and ψ̂ are field operators and V_int is the interaction term. When translated into the path integral language with Grassmann fields ψ̄ and ψ, the action becomes:\n    *   S[ψ̄, ψ] = ∫₀ʰᵝ dτ ∫ dᵈx [ ψ̄(x,τ) (ħ∂_τ - ħ²∇²/(2m) - µ) ψ(x,τ) + V(ψ̄,ψ) ]\n    *   It is common practice in theoretical physics to work in natural units where ħ=1 and k_B=1. In this case, β = 1/T, and the action simplifies to:\n    *   S[ψ̄, ψ] = ∫₀ᵝ dτ ∫ dᵈx [ ψ̄(x,τ) (∂_τ - ∇²/(2m) - µ) ψ(x,τ) + V(ψ̄,ψ) ]\n5.  **Assemble the Final Formula:** Combining the functional integral measure, the exponential of the action, and enforcing the correct boundary conditions gives the final expression. The partition function Z is the sum (integral) over all anti-periodic field configurations of the statistical weight e⁻ˢ.\n\n***\n\n### The Final Formula\n\nThe formula for the fermionic partition function Z in the imaginary time (Euclidean) path integral formalism is given by a functional integral over anti-commuting Grassmann fields ψ(x,τ) and ψ̄(x,τ):\n\n$Z = \\int_{\\text{APBC}} \\mathcal{D}[\\bar{\\psi}]\\mathcal{D}[\\psi] \\exp\\left(-S_E[\\bar{\\psi}, \\psi]\\right)$\n\nwhere:\n\n1.  The integral is taken over all field configurations that satisfy **Anti-Periodic Boundary Conditions (APBC)** in the imaginary time direction τ:\n    *   $\\psi(\\mathbf{x}, \\tau=0) = -\\psi(\\mathbf{x}, \\tau=\\beta)$\n    *   $\\bar{\\psi}(\\mathbf{x}, \\tau=0) = -\\bar{\\psi}(\\mathbf{x}, \\tau=\\beta)$\n    with $\\beta = 1/(k_B T)$.\n\n2.  $\\mathcal{D}[\\bar{\\psi}]\\mathcal{D}[\\psi]$ is the **functional integration measure** over the independent Grassmann fields.\n\n3.  $S_E[\\bar{\\psi}, \\psi]$ is the **Euclidean action** of the system. For a general system of interacting fermions, it is given by:\n    $S_E[\\bar{\\psi}, \\psi] = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d\\mathbf{x} \\left[ \\bar{\\psi}(\\mathbf{x}, \\tau) \\left( \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\tau} - \\frac{\\nabla^2}{2m} - \\mu \\right) \\psi(\\mathbf{x}, \\tau) + V(\\bar{\\psi}, \\psi) \\right]$\n    Here, μ is the chemical potential and V(ψ̄, ψ) represents the interaction terms between the fermions. In many theoretical contexts, natural units (ħ=1) are used."
