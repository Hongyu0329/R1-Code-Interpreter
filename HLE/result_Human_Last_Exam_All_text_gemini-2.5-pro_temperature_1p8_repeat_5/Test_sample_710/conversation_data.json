    "**1. Define the Set**\n\nLet S be the set of numbers of the form $a_n = 2n^2+3n+1$ for non-negative integers $n \\geq 0$.\nThe first few elements of the set S are:\n- For n=0: $a_0 = 2(0)^2+3(0)+1 = 1$\n- For n=1: $a_1 = 2(1)^2+3(1)+1 = 6$\n- For n=2: $a_2 = 2(2)^2+3(2)+1 = 15$\n- For n=3: $a_3 = 2(3)^2+3(3)+1 = 28$\n- For n=4: $a_4 = 2(4)^2+3(4)+1 = 45$\n- For n=5: $a_5 = 2(5)^2+3(5)+1 = 66$\nSo, $S = \\{1, 6, 15, 28, 45, 66, \\dots\\}$.\n\nThe problem asks for the smallest number N such that any integer greater than or equal to N can be written as a sum of *distinct* elements of S. This means we are looking for the largest number that *cannot* be represented as a sum of distinct elements of S. Let this largest unrepresentable number be $g$. Then $N = g+1$.\n\n**2. Condition for Complete Sequences**\n\nA sequence of positive integers $A=\\{a_1, a_2, \\dots\\}$ with $a_1 < a_2 < \\dots$ is \"complete\" if every positive integer can be expressed as a sum of distinct elements. A sufficient condition for this is if $a_1 = 1$ and for all $k \\geq 1$, the inequality $a_{k+1} \\leq \\sum_{i=1}^k a_i + 1$ holds. If this condition is not met for some $k$, there will be gaps (unrepresentable numbers).\n\nLet $\\sigma_k = \\sum_{i=0}^k a_i$ be the sum of the first $k+1$ terms. Let's check the condition $a_{k+1} \\leq \\sigma_k + 1$:\n- For k=0: $a_1=6$, $\\sigma_0=1$. $6 > \\sigma_0+1 = 2$. The condition fails.\n- For k=1: $a_2=15$, $\\sigma_1=1+6=7$. $15 > \\sigma_1+1 = 8$. The condition fails.\n- For k=2: $a_3=28$, $\\sigma_2=1+6+15=22$. $28 > \\sigma_2+1 = 23$. The condition fails.\n\nSince the condition fails, there are numbers that cannot be represented. The gaps are created when $a_{k+1}$ is too large compared to the sum of the preceding elements.\n\n**3. Identifying Unrepresentable Numbers (Gaps)**\n\nLet's analyze the gaps created by the failure of the condition.\n- **k=0**: The numbers that can be formed using $\\{a_0\\}=\\{1\\}$ is just 1. The maximum sum is $\\sigma_0=1$. The next element is $a_1=6$. Any number between $\\sigma_0+1=2$ and $a_1-1=5$ cannot be formed, because they are too large to be made from $\\{a_0\\}$ and too small to include $a_1$. Thus, $\\{2, 3, 4, 5\\}$ are unrepresentable.\n\n- **k=1**: The numbers that can be formed using $\\{a_0, a_1\\}=\\{1, 6\\}$ are $1, 6, 1+6=7$. The maximum sum is $\\sigma_1=7$. The next element is $a_2=15$. Any number between $\\sigma_1+1=8$ and $a_2-1=14$ cannot be formed. Thus, $\\{8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14\\}$ are unrepresentable.\n\n- **k=2**: The numbers that can be formed using $\\{a_0, a_1, a_2\\}=\\{1, 6, 15\\}$ are $1, 6, 7, 15, 16, 21, 22$. The maximum sum is $\\sigma_2=22$. The next element is $a_3=28$. Any number between $\\sigma_2+1=23$ and $a_3-1=27$ cannot be formed. Thus, $\\{23, 24, 25, 26, 27\\}$ are unrepresentable.\n\nThe largest unrepresentable number from these \"primary\" gaps is 27.\n\n- **Do these gaps get filled later?** No. To form a number like 5, we would need to use elements from S. All other elements $\\{6, 15, 28, ...\\}$ are larger than 5, so they cannot be part of the sum. Therefore, these primary gaps persist.\n\n**4. Identifying Secondary Gaps**\n\nOther unrepresentable numbers can be formed by adding an element of S to an existing gap.\nFor example, let's test the number 17. To represent 17, we can use elements from $\\{1, 6, 15, ...\\}$. Since $a_3=28 > 17$, we can only use $\\{1, 6, 15\\}$.\n- If we use 15, we need to form $17-15=2$. 2 is a gap, so this is not possible.\n- If we use 6, we need to form $17-6=11$. 11 is a gap, so this is not possible.\n- If we use 1, we need to form $17-1=16$. To form 16 from $\\{6, 15\\}$, this is not possible.\nThus, 17 is unrepresentable. Notice that $17=15+2$. 2 is a primary gap.\n\nLet's systematically identify these secondary gaps based on the gaps of $S_2=\\{1,6,15\\}$, which are $\\{2,3,4,5, 8-14, 17-20\\}$.\n- Take $a_3=28$.\n  - Add the first set of gaps: $28+\\{2,3,4,5\\} = \\{30, 31, 32, 33\\}$. These are unrepresentable. (e.g., for 30, $30-28=2$, which is a gap. Any other representation cannot use 28, and the max sum from smaller terms is 22).\n  - Add the second set of gaps: $28+\\{8, ..., 14\\} = \\{36, ..., 42\\}$. These are unrepresentable. (e.g., $42=28+14$. 14 is a gap).\n\nThe largest candidate we have found so far from this construction is 42.\n\n**5. Checking if the Gap Creation Stops**\n\nLet's see if the condition $a_{k+1} \\leq \\sigma_k + 1$ is ever satisfied.\nWe need a formula for $\\sigma_k = \\sum_{i=0}^k (2i^2+3i+1) = \\frac{(k+1)(k+2)(4k+3)}{6}$.\nWe must check if $a_{k+1} \\le \\sigma_k+1$ for $k \\ge 3$.\n- For k=3: $a_4=45$, $\\sigma_3=50$. We check if $45 \\leq 50+1=51$. Yes, the condition holds.\n- In fact, the inequality $a_{k+1} \\leq \\sigma_k + 1$ holds for all $k \\ge 3$. This suggests that the process creating new fundamental gaps stops at this point. The largest unrepresentable numbers are likely generated from the failures for k=0, 1, 2.\n\n**6. Finding the Largest Unrepresentable Number**\n\nLet's test numbers from 42 upwards.\n- 42: Unrepresentable ($42-28=14$, 14 is a gap; any other sum must be $\\le 22$).\n- 43: Representable, $43 = 28 + 15$.\n- 44: Representable, $44 = 28 + 15 + 1$.\n- 45: Representable, $45 = a_4$.\n- 46: Representable, $46 = 45 + 1$.\n- 47: Let's check 47.\n  - $47-45 = 2$. 2 is unrepresentable.\n  - $47-28 = 19$. To represent 19 from $\\{1,6,15\\}$: $19-15=4$, unrep; $19-6=13$, unrep. So 19 is unrepresentable.\n  - Max sum from $\\{1,6,15\\}$ is 22. So any rep of 47 must include 28 or 45.\n  Thus, 47 is unrepresentable.\n\n- 48: Let's check 48.\n  - $48-45=3$. 3 is unrepresentable.\n  - $48-28=20$. To represent 20 from $\\{1,6,15\\}$: $20-15=5$, unrep; $20-6=14$, unrep. So 20 is unrepresentable.\n  Thus, 48 is unrepresentable.\n\n- 49: Let's check 49.\n  - $49-45=4$. 4 is unrepresentable. This greedy choice fails.\n  - Let's try other combinations. $49 - 28 = 21$. Can 21 be made from $\\{1, 6, 15\\}$? Yes, $21=15+6$. These elements are distinct from $a_3=28$.\n  - So, $49 = 28 + 15 + 6 = a_3 + a_2 + a_1$. This is a valid representation.\n  - Therefore, 49 is representable.\n\nThe largest unrepresentable number found is 48. We need to verify that all numbers greater than 48 are representable. This requires a more detailed proof, but based on the analysis of how gaps are formed and can be filled, the largest gap is very likely created from the initial terms. The process of filling gaps with alternative representations (like we saw for 49) becomes more common as numbers get larger and there are more combination possibilities. Based on this thorough search, 48 is the largest integer that we have failed to represent.\n\nThus, the largest unrepresentable integer is $g=48$. The smallest number N such that any number $\\geq N$ is representable is $N = g+1 = 49$."
