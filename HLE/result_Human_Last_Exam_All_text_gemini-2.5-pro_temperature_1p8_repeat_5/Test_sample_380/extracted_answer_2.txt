No, the local magnetic field at the L1 point is generally not radial. It follows the Parker spiral and is typically oriented at about a 45-degree angle to the radial direction.

The use of magnetic field components perpendicular to the radial direction (Y and Z components in a GSE-like frame) to calculate magnetic helicity is a common and justifiable approximation based on two key principles:

1.  **Taylor's Hypothesis:** The solar wind flows outward from the Sun at a very high speed (super-Alfvénic flow), which is directed radially. This fast flow sweeps all plasma structures, including Alfvén waves, past a stationary spacecraft at L1. Consequently, the apparent direction of propagation measured by the spacecraft is dominated by the radial solar wind velocity, not the wave's intrinsic propagation along the magnetic field line. Therefore, analyzing wave properties in a coordinate system based on this apparent (radial) propagation is a physically motivated simplification.

2.  **Quasi-Parallel Propagation Condition:** The approximation is most accurate when the local magnetic field itself is nearly parallel to the solar wind velocity (i.e., when the magnetic field is "quasi-radial"). Many scientific studies on Alfvén waves specifically select these time intervals for analysis. In such cases, the plane perpendicular to the radial direction is an excellent proxy for the plane perpendicular to the local magnetic field, validating the use of Y and Z components.

In summary, your intuition is correct that the most rigorous calculation would use components perpendicular to the local magnetic field (a Field-Aligned Coordinate system). However, using components perpendicular to the radial direction is a well-established and valid practical approach justified by the physics of the solar wind environment at L1.
