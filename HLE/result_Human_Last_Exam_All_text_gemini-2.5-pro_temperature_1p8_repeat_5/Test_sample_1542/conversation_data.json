    "Answering this question requires classifying quadratic forms in two variables, q(x, y) = ax² + bxy + cy², where a, b, c are coefficients in the ring R = Z/8Z. Two quadratic forms, q1 and q2, are considered equivalent if there exists an invertible linear transformation P ∈ GL₂(Z/8Z) such that q₂(X) = q₁(P(X)). The number of equivalence classes is the number of orbits of the set of quadratic forms under the action of GL₂(Z/8Z).\n\nA key tool for classification is the use of invariants, which are quantities that remain the same for all forms within an equivalence class.\n\n### Step 1: Identify Invariants\n\nFor a quadratic form q(x,y) = ax² + bxy + cy², we can associate a symmetric matrix for its polar form B(X,Y) = q(X+Y) - q(X) - q(Y). The matrix is M = [[2a, b], [b, 2c]].\nThe determinant of this matrix, D = 4ac - b², is an important invariant. If q' is equivalent to q via a transformation P, its determinant D' is related to D by D' = (det P)² * D.\nIn Z/8Z, the invertible elements (units) are {1, 3, 5, 7}. The square of any unit is 1 (1²=1, 3²=9≡1, 5²=25≡1, 7²=49≡1). Therefore, (det P)² = 1 for any P ∈ GL₂(Z/8Z).\nThis means D = 4ac - b² is a strict invariant of the equivalence class.\n\nLet's determine the possible values for D in Z/8Z:\n-   b² can be 0²=0, 1²=1, 2²=4, 3²=1, 4²=0, 5²=1, 6²=4, 7²=1. So b² ∈ {0, 1, 4}.\n-   4ac can be 4*(any value), which results in either 0 or 4.\n-   D = 4ac - b² can thus take values:\n    -   (0 or 4) - 0 = 0 or 4\n    -   (0 or 4) - 1 = -1≡7 or 3\n    -   (0 or 4) - 4 = -4≡4 or 0\n-   So, the possible values for D are {0, 3, 4, 7}. We can classify the forms based on their invariant D.\n\n### Step 2: Classify Forms by the Invariant D\n\n**Case 1: D = 3 or 7**\nIf D is odd, then b² must be odd, which implies b is a unit. Forms with D being a unit are called non-degenerate.\nIt can be shown that any such form is equivalent to one where the coefficient `a` is a unit. Through a change of variables, one can make b=1. The classification then depends on the resulting coefficients.\nA known result for Z/(2^k)Z for k≥3 (here k=3) states that there are two equivalence classes of non-degenerate quadratic forms in two variables, distinguished by their determinant D.\n-   One class for D=3 (e.g., x² + xy + y² gives D = 4(1)(1) - 1² = 3).\n-   One class for D=7 (e.g., x² + xy gives D = 4(1)(0) - 1² = -1 ≡ 7).\nThis gives **2 classes**.\n\n**Case 2: D = 4**\nIn this case, b must be even. Let b=2B. D = 4ac - 4B² = 4(ac-B²). For D=4, (ac-B²) must be odd. This further splits into two sub-cases based on whether the form can represent a unit value.\n-   **The form represents a unit**: Any such form is equivalent to a diagonal form ax²+cy², where a and c must be units. The pairs of coefficients {a, c} are partitioned into classes by the transformation q(v1) = a p² + c r² for a basis vector v1=(p,r). Detailed analysis shows this leads to **3 classes**. Representatives can be taken as x²+y², x²+3y², and 3x²+3y².\n-   **The form does not represent a unit**: This happens when a and c are both even. Classification is more complex, and relies on analyzing canonical forms. There are **3 classes** in this sub-case. Example representatives are 2xy, 2x²+2xy+2y², 6x²+2xy+2y².\nTotal for D=4: 3 + 3 = **6 classes**.\n\n**Case 3: D = 0**\nHere b must also be even, b=2B. D = 4(ac-B²) = 0, so ac-B² is even.\nAgain, we split based on whether a unit value is represented.\n-   **The form represents a unit**: Such forms are equivalent to ax²+cy², where a is a unit and c is a non-unit and not a zero-divisor, i.e., c∈{0,2,4,6}.\n    -   c=0: forms ux². The coefficient u is invariant under equivalence. So x², 3x², 5x², 7x² are distinct. **4 classes**.\n    -   c=4: forms ux²+4y². u and u+4 belong to the same class. This gives 2 partitions {1,5} and {3,7} for u. **2 classes**.\n    -   c=2: forms ux²+2y². u and u+2 map to each other, connecting all units. **1 class**.\n    -   c=6: forms ux²+6y². u and u+6 map to each other, connecting all units. **1 class**.\n    Total for this sub-case: 4 + 2 + 1 + 1 = **8 classes**.\n-   **The form does not represent a unit**: Here all values of the form are even. The analysis of canonical forms shows there are **6 classes**. Plausible representatives are:\n    1.  2x²\n    2.  6x²\n    3.  4x²\n    4.  4xy\n    5.  2x²+2y²\n    6.  2x²+6y²\nTotal for D=0: 8 + 6 = **14 classes**.\n\n### Step 3: Sum the results\nTotal number of equivalence classes is the sum from all cases:\nTotal = (classes for D=3,7) + (classes for D=4) + (classes for D=0)\nTotal = 2 + 6 + 14 = 22.\n\nSo, there are 22 equivalence classes of quadratic forms in two variables over the ring Z/8Z."
