    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**1. Understand the Graph Structure: The Barbell Graph**\n\n*   A barbell graph is constructed by connecting two identical, separate components (usually cliques) with a path. In this case, since the path length is not specified, we assume the standard construction where two cliques are connected by a single edge (a path of length 1).\n*   The graph has a total of 10 nodes. Since a barbell graph is symmetric, it must be formed by two identical cliques. Let the size of each clique be $k$. Thus, $2k = 10$, which means each clique is a complete graph of 5 nodes ($K_5$).\n*   Let's call the two cliques $C_A$ and $C_B$.\n*   One node from $C_A$ (let's call it $u$) is connected to one node from $C_B$ (let's call it $v$) by a single edge. This edge, $(u, v)$, is the **bottleneck edge**.\n*   Let's verify the total number of nodes and edges:\n    *   **Nodes**: 5 in $C_A$ + 5 in $C_B$ = 10 nodes. This matches the problem statement.\n    *   **Edges**:\n        *   Edges within $C_A$ (a $K_5$): $\\binom{5}{2} = \\frac{5 \\times 4}{2} = 10$ edges.\n        *   Edges within $C_B$ (a $K_5$): $\\binom{5}{2} = 10$ edges.\n        *   The bottleneck edge connecting $C_A$ and $C_B$: 1 edge.\n        *   Total edges: $10 + 10 + 1 = 21$ edges.\n\n**2. Analyze the Node Degrees**\n\nThe degree of a node is the number of edges connected to it. This is crucial for determining the probability in a gossiping protocol.\n*   **Bridge Nodes ($u$ and $v$)**:\n    *   Node $u$ is connected to the other 4 nodes within its clique $C_A$. It is also connected to node $v$ via the bottleneck edge.\n    *   Therefore, the degree of $u$ is $d(u) = 4 + 1 = 5$.\n    *   By symmetry, the degree of node $v$ is also $d(v) = 4 + 1 = 5$.\n*   **Non-Bridge Nodes**:\n    *   Any other node in $C_A$ (there are $5-1=4$ such nodes) is only connected to the other 4 nodes within $C_A$. Its degree is 4.\n    *   Similarly, the other 4 nodes in $C_B$ each have a degree of 4.\n*   **Summary of Degrees**: 2 nodes have a degree of 5, and 8 nodes have a degree of 4.\n\n**3. Understand the Gossiping Process**\n\n*   The problem specifies \"randomized uniform gossiping\". This describes how information is passed in a single step.\n*   The process involves two stages:\n    1.  A starting node, let's call it `i`, is chosen **uniformly at random** from the set of all $N=10$ nodes. The probability of choosing any specific node is $1/10$.\n    2.  This node `i` then chooses one of its neighbors, let's call it `j`, **uniformly at random** to send the information to. The probability of choosing a specific neighbor `j` is $1/d(i)$, where $d(i)$ is the degree of node `i`.\n*   The question asks for the probability of \"sampling the bottleneck edge\". In the context of this process, it means: What is the probability that the edge `(i, j)` selected in this single step is the bottleneck edge `(u, v)`?\n\n**4. Calculate the Probability**\n\nThe bottleneck edge $(u,v)$ is sampled if one of two mutually exclusive events occurs:\n*   **Event 1**: The starting node is $u$, and it chooses to gossip to $v$.\n*   **Event 2**: The starting node is $v$, and it chooses to gossip to $u$.\n\nWe can calculate the probability of each event and add them together.\n\n*   **Probability of Event 1 ($u \\rightarrow v$)**:\n    *   The probability of choosing $u$ as the starting node is $P(i=u) = 1/10$.\n    *   Given that we started at $u$, the probability of choosing $v$ as its neighbor is $P(j=v | i=u) = 1/d(u) = 1/5$.\n    *   The total probability of Event 1 is $P(u \\rightarrow v) = P(i=u) \\times P(j=v | i=u) = \\frac{1}{10} \\times \\frac{1}{5} = \\frac{1}{50}$.\n\n*   **Probability of Event 2 ($v \\rightarrow u$)**:\n    *   The probability of choosing $v$ as the starting node is $P(i=v) = 1/10$.\n    *   Given that we started at $v$, the probability of choosing $u$ as its neighbor is $P(j=u | i=v) = 1/d(v) = 1/5$.\n    *   The total probability of Event 2 is $P(v \\rightarrow u) = P(i=v) \\times P(j=u | i=v) = \\frac{1}{10} \\times \\frac{1}{5} = \\frac{1}{50}$.\n\n*   **Total Probability**:\n    *   The total probability of sampling the bottleneck edge is the sum of the probabilities of these two events:\n    *   $P(\\text{bottleneck sampled}) = P(u \\rightarrow v) + P(v \\rightarrow u) = \\frac{1}{50} + \\frac{1}{50} = \\frac{2}{50} = \\frac{1}{25}$.\n\n### **Careful Points**\n\n1.  **Graph Model**: The interpretation of the \"barbell graph with 10 nodes\" as two $K_5$ cliques connected by an edge is the most standard one. A different structure would lead to a different answer.\n2.  **Gossiping Model**: It's crucial to understand that gossiping is a node-centric process (a node chooses a neighbor), not an edge-centric one (like picking an edge uniformly from all edges). Picking a random edge from the 21 total edges would give a probability of $1/21$, which is incorrect.\n3.  **Degree Calculation**: The degrees of the bridge nodes ($u$ and $v$) are different from the other nodes in their respective cliques. Accurately calculating these degrees (5 for bridge nodes, 4 for others) is essential.\n4.  **Symmetry**: Recognizing the symmetry of the graph and the process simplifies the calculation. The probability of traversing the edge from $u$ to $v$ is the same as from $v$ to $u$.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nThe probability of sampling the bottleneck edge is the sum of the probabilities of traversing it in either direction.\nProbability = $P(u \\rightarrow v) + P(v \\rightarrow u) = \\frac{1}{50} + \\frac{1}{50} = \\frac{2}{50} = \\frac{1}{25}$.\n\n<<<1/25>>>"
