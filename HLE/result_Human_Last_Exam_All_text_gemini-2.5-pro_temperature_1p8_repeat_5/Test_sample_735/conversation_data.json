    "This problem asks for the number of finite groups that possess a specific type of subset: a maximal by inclusion product-free set of size 3. Let's break down the problem to understand the constraints on the group `G`.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Definitions\n\n*   **Group (G):** A set with an associative binary operation, an identity element, and inverse elements for all its members. We are considering finite groups, meaning `|G|` is finite.\n*   **Product-Free Set (S):** A subset `S` of `G` is called product-free if for any two elements `x, y ∈ S` (not necessarily distinct), their product `xy` is not an element of `S`. In other words, the set of products `S*S = {xy | x, y ∈ S}` has no elements in common with `S` (`S*S ∩ S = ∅`).\n*   **Size 3:** We are interested in product-free sets `S` where `|S| = 3`. Let's denote such a set as `S = {a, b, c}`.\n*   **Maximal by Inclusion:** A product-free set `S` is maximal if it cannot be extended by adding any element from the group without losing the product-free property. Formally, `S` is maximal if for any element `g ∈ G \\ S`, the new set `S U {g}` is *not* product-free.\n\n### Step 2: Immediate Consequences of the Definitions\n\n1.  **The identity element `e` cannot be in S:** If `e ∈ S`, then `e * e = e`, which is in `S`. This violates the product-free condition. Therefore, `e ∉ S`.\n2.  **Maximality condition for `e`:** Since `e ∉ S`, we can test the maximality condition for `g = e`. The set `S U {e}` is not product-free because for any `a ∈ S`, `a` and `e` are in `S U {e}`, and their product `a * e = a` is also in `S U {e}`. Thus, the maximality condition for the identity element `e` is always satisfied for any product-free set `S` that does not contain `e`.\n3.  **Maximality condition for other elements:** For any element `g ∈ G \\ (S ∪ {e})`, the set `S U {g}` must not be product-free. Since `S` is already product-free, the product that breaks the condition must involve `g`. This means for any such `g`, at least one of the following relations must hold for some elements `s, s₁, s₂ ∈ S`:\n    *   `s₁ * s₂ = g`\n    *   `g * s = s₁`\n    *   `s * g = s₁`\n    *   `g * g = s₁`\n\nThis structural constraint significantly limits the possible groups `G` and their structure relative to the set `S`.\n\n### Step 3: Classification of such Sets and Groups\n\nThe problem of classifying which groups have such sets is a non-trivial problem in combinatorial group theory. Such sets can be categorized based on their algebraic structure. A full case-by-case analysis from first principles is highly complex, but the main approaches are as follows:\n\n**Case A: S is a coset of a subgroup H**\n\nIf `S` is a coset, `S = gH` for some subgroup `H` of `G`.\n*   Since `|S|=3`, the subgroup `H` must have order 3, so `H = {e, h, h²}`.\n*   `S = {g, gh, gh²}`.\n*   A detailed analysis shows that for `S` to be a maximal product-free set, `H` must be a normal subgroup of `G` with index 2 (meaning `|G/H|=2`, so `|G|=6`).\n*   The groups of order 6 are the cyclic group `Z_6` and the symmetric group `S_3` (also the dihedral group `D_6`).\n*   For **`Z_6`** (additive group `{0,1,2,3,4,5}`): Let `H={0,2,4}`. This is a normal subgroup of order 3. Let `g=1`. The coset `S = 1+H = {1,3,5}` is a maximal product-free set of size 3.\n*   For **`S_3`**: Let `H = {e, (123), (132)}`. This is a normal subgroup of order 3. Let `g=(12)`. The coset `S = (12)H = {(12), (13), (23)}` is a maximal product-free set of size 3.\n\nThis analysis yields **2** such groups.\n\n**Case B: S is not a coset of any subgroup**\n\nThese sets are sometimes called \"non-linear\". Finding these requires either a computer search or a much deeper analysis of the relations derived in Step 2. For instance, in the dihedral group of order 8, `D_8`, the set `S = {r, r³, f}` (where `r` is a rotation of 90 degrees and `f` is a reflection) can be shown to be a maximal product-free set of size 3. `D_8` has no subgroup of order 3, so this set cannot be a coset.\n\n### Step 4: The Complete Classification\n\nA complete classification of these groups was done by Michael Giudici and Stephen Hart (2020). Their research confirms the existence of groups that fall into \"Case B\" and provides a definitive answer. According to their work, there are exactly nine non-isomorphic finite groups containing a maximal product-free set of size 3.\n\nThe nine groups are:\n1.  **`Z_6`** (Cyclic group of order 6)\n2.  **`S_3`** (Symmetric group of order 6, also `D_6`)\n3.  **`D_8`** (Dihedral group of order 8)\n4.  **`Q_8`** (Quaternion group of order 8)\n5.  **`Z_2 × Z_4`** (Abelian group of order 8)\n6.  **`D_10`** (Dihedral group of order 10)\n7.  **`Z_3 ⋊ Z_4`** (Semidirect product of order 12, also called the dicyclic group `Dic_3`)\n8.  **`A_4`** (Alternating group of order 12)\n9.  **`(Z_3 × Z_3) ⋊ Z_2`** (Semidirect product of order 18, also isomorphic to `S_3 × Z_3`)\n\nThese nine groups are distinct (non-isomorphic), and this list is exhaustive.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the complete classification in the mathematical literature, there are exactly 9 finite groups that contain a maximal by inclusion product-free set of size 3.\n\n<<<9>>>"
