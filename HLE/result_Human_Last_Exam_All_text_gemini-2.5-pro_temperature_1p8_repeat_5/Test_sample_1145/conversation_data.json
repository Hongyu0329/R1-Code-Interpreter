    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the System and Key Formulas\nThe problem describes a particle in a one-dimensional (1D) infinite potential well, often called a \"particle in a box\".\n\n*   **System:** Particle in a 1D box of length `a`.\n*   **The normalized wavefunction** for this system is:\n    `ψ_n(x) = sqrt(2/a) * sin(nπx/a)`\n    where `n` is the quantum number (an integer `n = 1, 2, 3, ...`), and `x` is the position inside the box (`0 ≤ x ≤ a`).\n\n*   **The probability density** of finding the particle at a position `x` is given by the square of the magnitude of the wavefunction:\n    `P(x) = |ψ_n(x)|^2 = (2/a) * sin^2(nπx/a)`\n\n*   **The probability of finding the particle in an interval** from `x1` to `x2` is the integral of the probability density over that interval:\n    `P(x1 ≤ x ≤ x2) = ∫[from x1 to x2] |ψ_n(x)|^2 dx`\n\n### Step 2: Apply the Specifics of the Question\nWe are given:\n*   The quantum state `n = 2`.\n*   The interval is from `x1 = 0.495a` to `x2 = 0.505a`.\n\nFirst, let's write the specific probability density function for `n = 2`:\n`P(x) = |ψ_2(x)|^2 = (2/a) * sin^2(2πx/a)`\n\nNow, we set up the integral for the probability:\n`P = ∫[from 0.495a to 0.505a] (2/a) * sin^2(2πx/a) dx`\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Interval and Choose a Calculation Method\n*   **The width of the interval** is `Δx = 0.505a - 0.495a = 0.01a`. This is a very small interval.\n*   **The center of the interval** is `x_mid = (0.495a + 0.505a) / 2 = 0.5a`.\n*   **A crucial point:** For the `n=2` state, the point `x = 0.5a` (or `a/2`) is a **node**. A node is a point where the wavefunction is zero, meaning the probability density is also zero.\n    `P(0.5a) = (2/a) * sin^2(2π(0.5a)/a) = (2/a) * sin^2(π) = (2/a) * (0)^2 = 0`.\n*   Because the interval is very small, we can approximate the probability by assuming the probability density is nearly constant over the interval. However, since the density is zero at the center and changes rapidly nearby, the simple approximation `P ≈ P(x_mid) * Δx` would incorrectly give `P = 0`. We need a more accurate method.\n\n### Step 4: Perform the Integration\nSince a simple approximation is insufficient, we must solve the integral. We can either perform the full integration or use a Taylor series approximation for the integrand, which is more suitable here.\n\n**Approximation Method (using Taylor series):**\nThis method is very effective for small intervals around a point where the function's behavior is known.\n1.  Let's expand the probability density `f(x) = (2/a) * sin^2(2πx/a)` around the center of the interval, `x_c = a/2`.\n2.  Let `u = x - a/2`, which means `x = u + a/2`. The integration is now over `u` from `-0.005a` to `+0.005a`.\n3.  Substitute `x` into the function:\n    `f(u) = (2/a) * sin^2(2π(u + a/2)/a) = (2/a) * sin^2(2πu/a + π)`\n4.  Using the identity `sin(θ + π) = -sin(θ)`, we get `sin^2(θ + π) = sin^2(θ)`.\n    `f(u) = (2/a) * sin^2(2πu/a)`\n5.  Since `u` is small in the interval, we can use the small-angle approximation `sin(z) ≈ z` for `z = 2πu/a`.\n    `f(u) ≈ (2/a) * (2πu/a)^2 = (2/a) * (4π^2 u^2 / a^2) = (8π^2 / a^3) * u^2`\n6.  Now, we can easily integrate this approximate function:\n    `P ≈ ∫[from -0.005a to 0.005a] (8π^2 / a^3) * u^2 du`\n    `P ≈ (8π^2 / a^3) * [u^3 / 3]` (evaluated from `-0.005a` to `0.005a`)\n    `P ≈ (8π^2 / (3a^3)) * [(0.005a)^3 - (-0.005a)^3]`\n    `P ≈ (8π^2 / (3a^3)) * [2 * (0.005)^3 * a^3]`\n7.  The `a^3` terms cancel out, which is expected as probability is dimensionless.\n    `P ≈ (16π^2 / 3) * (0.005)^3`\n    `P ≈ (16π^2 / 3) * (1.25 × 10^-7)`\n8.  Now, we calculate the numerical value using `π ≈ 3.14159`.\n    `P ≈ (16 * (3.14159)^2 / 3) * (1.25 × 10^-7)`\n    `P ≈ (16 * 9.8696 / 3) * (1.25 × 10^-7)`\n    `P ≈ (52.6379) * (1.25 × 10^-7)`\n    `P ≈ 6.5797 × 10^-6`\n\n### Final Answer\nThe probability that the particle in the 1D box is located in an interval from `0.495a` to `0.505a` for `n=2` is approximately `6.58 × 10^-6`.\n\n<<<6.58e-6>>>"
