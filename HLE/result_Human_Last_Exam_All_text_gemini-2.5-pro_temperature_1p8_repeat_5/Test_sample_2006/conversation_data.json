    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Decode the Title**\nThe title of the haiku is \"The Bays\". This is a pun and should be interpreted phonetically as \"The 'B's\". This tells us that the answer to the question will be a list of words or names that start with the letter 'B'.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Haiku's Structure and Theme**\nThe haiku has three lines. It is logical to assume that each line provides a clue to one of the 'B' words. The words within the haiku, such as \"tempest\" and \"winds\", establish a clear theme of meteorology (the study of weather). Therefore, we are looking for three meteorological terms that begin with the letter 'B'.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Each Line for its 'B' Word**\n\n*   **Line 1: \"An August tempest\"**\n    *   A \"tempest\" is a storm, which is defined by atmospheric pressure systems. There is a meteorological law that relates wind direction to the center of low pressure in a storm. This law is named after the Dutch meteorologist C. H. D. **Buys Ballot**. This law is crucial for understanding and navigating tempests.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The clue isn't a specific word in the line, but the concept the line describes. A tempest is where Buys Ballot's law is most applicable.\n    *   **Result:** Buys Ballot\n\n*   **Line 2: \"Twice fifteen brings winds of change\"**\n    *   This line contains a mathematical clue: \"Twice fifteen\" equals 30.\n    *   The line also mentions \"winds\". Wind speed is measured on a scale invented by Sir Francis **Beaufort**.\n    *   A wind of 30 knots falls into Force 7 on the Beaufort Scale. The clue uses a number on his scale to point directly to the creator.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The number 30 is not the answer itself, but a key to unlock the answer, which is the name of the scale's creator.\n    *   **Result:** Beaufort\n\n*   **Line 3: \"A divine one yields\"**\n    *   This clue is descriptive. We are looking for a weather phenomenon. \"A divine one\" suggests something god-like or awe-inspiring involving a single figure (\"one\"). \"Yields\" means it is produced or appears under certain conditions.\n    *   This perfectly describes the **Brocken Spectre**. This is an optical phenomenon where an observer's own shadow is cast onto a cloud or mist below, appearing huge and surrounded by a glorious, halo-like ring of light. The \"divine one\" is the observer's own magnified shadow.\n    *   **Careful Point:** \"Divine one\" refers to how the phenomenon appears to the observer, not a literal deity.\n    *   **Result:** Brocken Spectre\n\n**Step 4: Collate and Order the Answer**\nThe three 'B's we have found are: Beaufort, Brocken Spectre, and Buys Ballot. The question asks for the answer to be in alphabetical order.\n\n1.  Beaufort\n2.  Brocken Spectre\n3.  Buys Ballot\n\n<<<Beaufort, Brocken Spectre, Buys Ballot>>>"
