    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the identity of the physicist.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the key elements of the question.**\nThe question asks for a specific physicist identified by several key characteristics:\n*   A physicist.\n*   Primarily known for work in the field of microscopy.\n*   Discovered an important optical effect.\n*   The effect was observed in real imagery.\n*   The initial observation was made accidentally by a custodial worker.\n*   The context of the observation involved the cleaning of concave mirrors.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the clues to narrow down the possibilities.**\nThe most distinctive clue is the anecdote involving the custodial worker and the concave mirrors. This is a well-known story in the history of optics and immediately points to a specific discovery. This discovery relates to making invisible objects (or features) visible.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the physicist and the discovery associated with the anecdote.**\nThe story describes the work of the Dutch physicist **Frits Zernike**.\n*   Zernike was working with concave mirrors and diffraction gratings for spectroscopy. He noticed that faint \"ghost\" images appeared, corresponding to imperfections and grooves in the grating. These grooves are phase objects—they alter the phase of the light that reflects off them but not its amplitude (brightness), making them essentially invisible.\n*   The famous anecdote states that when Zernike was explaining this faint phenomenon, a janitor or custodial worker who was present remarked that he saw a similar effect all the time when cleaning the mirrors—he could see his cleaning marks in the reflection under certain conditions.\n*   This observation helped confirm to Zernike that he was onto a significant effect: a method to convert invisible phase variations into visible amplitude (brightness) variations.\n\n**Step 4: Connect the discovery to the field of microscopy.**\nWhile the initial discovery was made while working with mirrors and gratings, Zernike's true breakthrough was realizing its application to microscopy. Biological specimens, such as living cells, are largely transparent. Like the grooves on the mirror, they are phase objects. Staining them to make them visible usually kills them. Zernike developed a technique, now called **phase-contrast microscopy**, which uses a special \"phase plate\" to manipulate the light passing through the specimen. This technique converts the phase shifts introduced by the transparent cell structures into differences in brightness, allowing scientists to see and study living cells without staining.\n\n**Step 5: Confirm all criteria from the question are met.**\n*   **Physicist?** Yes, Frits Zernike was a physicist.\n*   **Better known for microscopy?** Yes, he won the 1953 Nobel Prize in Physics specifically for his invention of the phase-contrast microscope. This is his most famous contribution.\n*   **Discovered an optical effect?** Yes, the phase-contrast principle.\n*   **In real imagery?** Yes, the effect is observed in the final image plane of the microscope or optical system.\n*   **Accidental observation by a custodial worker?** Yes, this is the well-documented anecdote that spurred his insight.\n*   **Cleaning concave mirrors?** Yes, this was the context of the initial observation.\n\n**Conclusion**\nAll points of the question clearly point to Frits Zernike, whose Nobel Prize-winning work on phase-contrast microscopy originated from an observation involving concave mirrors and was famously confirmed by a custodial worker.\n\n<<<Frits Zernike>>>"
