    "An analysis of the question is performed step-by-step to arrive at the final answer.\n\n**1. Deconstruction of the Definitions**\n\nFirst, let's understand all the terms involved in the question.\n\n*   **Finite Group G:** A group with a finite number of elements.\n*   **Product-Free Set S:** A subset `S` of `G` is called product-free if for any two elements `x, y \\in S` (not necessarily distinct), their product `xy` is not in `S`. This can be written as `S \\cdot S \\cap S = \\emptyset`. An immediate consequence is that the identity element `e` cannot be in any product-free set, because `e \\cdot e = e`.\n*   **Maximal by Inclusion Product-Free Set (or Maximal Product-Free Set):** A product-free set `S` is maximal if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set in `G`. This means that for any element `g \\in G \\setminus S`, the new set `S \\cup \\{g\\}` is no longer product-free.\n*   **A Set S Fills G:** A subset `S` of `G` is said to fill `G` if `G = S \\cup S^{-1} \\cup \\{e\\}`, where `S^{-1} = \\{s^{-1} | s \\in S\\}`. This condition means that every non-identity element of `G` is either in `S` or its inverse is in `S` (or both).\n*   **Filled Group:** A finite group `G` is filled if **every** maximal product-free set in `G` fills `G`.\n*   **The Question:** We are asked to find all **nonabelian** groups `G` of order `|G| = 2q^m`, where `q` is an odd prime and `m` is a natural number (we assume `m \\ge 1`), that are filled groups.\n\n**2. Analyzing Groups of Order `2q^m`**\n\nLet `G` be any group of order `2q^m`, where `q` is an odd prime.\nWe use Sylow's Theorems to analyze the structure of `G`.\nLet `P` be a Sylow `q`-subgroup of `G`. Its order is `|P| = q^m`.\nLet `n_q` be the number of Sylow `q`-subgroups in `G`.\nAccording to Sylow's Third Theorem:\n1.  `n_q` must divide the index of `P` in `G`, which is `|G|/|P| = (2q^m)/q^m = 2`. So, `n_q` can be either 1 or 2.\n2.  `n_q` must be congruent to 1 modulo `q`. That is, `n_q \\equiv 1 \\pmod q`.\n\nLet's test the possible values for `n_q`:\n*   If `n_q = 1`: `1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod q`, which is always true.\n*   If `n_q = 2`: `2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod q`. This implies that `q` must divide `2-1=1`. Since `q` is a prime number, this is impossible.\n\nTherefore, the only possibility is `n_q = 1`. This means that `G` has a unique Sylow `q`-subgroup. A unique Sylow subgroup is always a normal subgroup.\nSo, any group `G` of order `2q^m` (with `q` an odd prime) must contain a normal subgroup `P` of order `q^m`. The index of this subgroup `P` in `G` is `[G:P] = |G|/|P| = 2`.\n\n**3. Constructing a Test Case: A Specific Maximal Product-Free Set**\n\nSince any group `G` of order `2q^m` has a normal subgroup `P` of index 2, let's analyze the properties of the set of elements not in `P`.\nLet `S = G \\setminus P`. `S` is the non-identity coset of `P`.\n\n*   **Is `S` product-free?**\n    The quotient group `G/P` has order 2. Its elements are the cosets `P` (the identity) and `S`. Let `x, y \\in S`. Then the coset containing `xy` is `(xP)(yP) = S \\cdot S`. In a group of order 2, the product of the non-identity element with itself is the identity. So, `S \\cdot S = P`. This means `xy \\in P`. Since `S \\cap P = \\emptyset`, we have `xy \\notin S`. Thus, `S` is a product-free set.\n\n*   **Is `S` a maximal product-free set?**\n    To be maximal, for any element `g \\in G \\setminus S`, the set `S \\cup \\{g\\}` must not be product-free.\n    `G \\setminus S = P`. So let `g` be any element in `P`. Now consider the set `S \\cup \\{g\\}`.\n    Take any element `x \\in S`. Let's look at the product `xg`. The coset containing `xg` is `(xP)(gP) = S \\cdot P = S`. So, `xg \\in S`.\n    We have `x \\in S \\subseteq S \\cup \\{g\\}` and `g \\in P` so `g \\in S \\cup \\{g\\}`. Their product `xg` is in `S`, which means `xg \\in S \\cup \\{g\\}`. This violates the product-free condition for `S \\cup \\{g\\}`.\n    Therefore, `S = G \\setminus P` is a maximal product-free set.\n\n**4. Testing the \"Filled Group\" Condition**\n\nNow, for `G` to be a filled group, this maximal product-free set `S` must fill `G`. The filling condition is: `G = S \\cup S^{-1} \\cup \\{e\\}`.\n\n*   Let's determine `S^{-1}`. `S` is the coset `G \\setminus P`. Let `x` be any element in `S`. This means `x \\notin P`. Since `P` is a subgroup, if `x \\in G`, then `x^{-1} \\in G`, and `x^{-1} \\in P` if and only if `x \\in P`. Since `x \\notin P`, its inverse `x^{-1}` cannot be in `P` either. Thus, `x^{-1}` must belong to `G \\setminus P = S`.\n    This shows that for any `x \\in S`, we have `x^{-1} \\in S`. Therefore, `S^{-1} = S`.\n\n*   Now, we substitute `S^{-1} = S` into the filling condition:\n    `G = S \\cup S \\cup \\{e\\} \\implies G = S \\cup \\{e\\}`.\n\n*   Finally, we substitute `S = G \\setminus P`:\n    `G = (G \\setminus P) \\cup \\{e\\}`.\n\nThis equality implies that the set `P` must contain only the identity element `e`, so `P = \\{e\\}`.\n\n**5. The Contradiction and Final Conclusion**\n\nThe result from step 4 (`P = \\{e\\}`) leads to a contradiction.\n*   `P` is the Sylow `q`-subgroup of `G`, so its order is `|P| = q^m`.\n*   The condition `P=\\{e\\}` means `|P|=1`.\n*   So, we must have `q^m = 1`.\n*   The problem states that `q` is an odd prime (`q \\ge 3`) and `m` is a natural number (`m \\ge 1`).\n*   For these values, `q^m` is always greater than 1. For instance, if `q=3, m=1`, then `q^m=3`.\n*   The condition `q^m=1` cannot be satisfied.\n\nThis contradiction arose from the assumption that `G` is a filled group. Therefore, the assumption must be false. This logic holds for any group of order `2q^m` (q odd prime, m >= 1), whether abelian or nonabelian.\n\nThe question asks for the nonabelian filled groups of this order. Since our proof shows that no group of this order can be filled, the set of such nonabelian groups is empty.\n\n<<<There are no nonabelian filled groups of order 2q^m for an odd prime q and a natural number m.>>>"
