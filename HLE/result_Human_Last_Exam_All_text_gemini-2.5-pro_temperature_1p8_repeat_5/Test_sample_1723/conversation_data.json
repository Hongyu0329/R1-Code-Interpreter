    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The question asks for the name of a *single genus* of mushroom. The defining characteristic is that it is known to produce a *distinctly blue spore print*.\n\n2.  **Understand \"Spore Print\":** A spore print is a crucial identification tool in mycology. It's the powdery deposit of spores obtained by placing a mushroom cap gills-down on a surface. The color of this deposit is a key taxonomic feature. It's important to distinguish the spore print color from the color of the mushroom's flesh, its gills, or any bruising reaction.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Common Misconceptions:** Many mushrooms are blue or turn blue, which can cause confusion.\n    *   ***Lactarius indigo***: This is a well-known mushroom that is blue in color and exudes a blue \"milk\" (latex) when cut. However, its spore print is **yellowish to ocher**, not blue.\n    *   **Blue-Staining Boletes (e.g., *Gyroporus cyanescens*)**: These mushrooms have flesh that bruises an intense blue color when cut or handled. Their spore prints are typically **pale yellow or olive-brown**.\n    *   **Psilocybin Mushrooms (e.g., *Psilocybe cubensis*)**: Many psychedelic mushrooms stain blue when damaged due to the oxidation of psilocin. Their spore prints are a characteristic **purple-brown to dark purplish-black**.\n\n4.  **Identify the Correct Genus:** Through mycological literature and databases, we search for genera that have species with blue spores. This is an extremely rare characteristic. Research consistently points to one specific genus.\n    *   The genus **Entoloma** is a large and diverse group of mushrooms, most of which have a pink to salmon-pink spore print.\n    *   However, a very small and specific group of species within this genus are the only fungi known to produce a true blue spore print. The blue color can be pale, sometimes described as sky-blue or grayish-blue, and can fade with age, but it is distinctly blue.\n    *   Species like *Entoloma subcarneum* and *Entoloma lazulinum* are cited as having blue spores.\n\n5.  **Synthesize the Conclusion:** While blue coloration in the mushroom body is relatively common, a blue spore print is exceptionally rare. The only genus known to contain species that produce this feature is *Entoloma*.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Spore Print vs. Mushroom Color:** The primary point of care is not to confuse the color of the mushroom's body or its bruising reaction with the color of its spores. The question is specifically about the spore print.\n*   **Rarity:** Blue is the rarest spore print color.\n*   **Genus-Specific Trait:** The question asks for the genus. While not all species in the genus *Entoloma* have a blue spore print (most have pink spores), it is the only genus where this trait is known to exist at all.\n*   **Subtlety of Color:** The blue spore print of these rare *Entoloma* species can be subtle and may not be a vibrant, deep blue.\n\nBy following these steps and carefully considering the distinction between a mushroom's physical appearance and its spore deposit, we arrive at the correct answer.\n\n<<<Entoloma>>>"
