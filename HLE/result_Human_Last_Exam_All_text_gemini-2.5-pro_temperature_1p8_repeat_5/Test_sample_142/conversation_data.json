    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of Configuration State Functions (CSFs) for a full Configuration Interaction (CI) calculation of $\\mathrm{CH}_2 \\mathrm{SiHF}$ with the 6-31G** basis set.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the number of electrons (N)\n\nFirst, we sum the electrons from each atom in the molecule $\\mathrm{CH}_2 \\mathrm{SiHF}$.\nThe molecule consists of one Carbon (C), three Hydrogen (H), one Silicon (Si), and one Fluorine (F) atom.\n\n*   Number of electrons in Carbon (C) = 6\n*   Number of electrons in Hydrogen (H) = 1. Since there are 3 H atoms, the total is 3 × 1 = 3.\n*   Number of electrons in Silicon (Si) = 14\n*   Number of electrons in Fluorine (F) = 9\n\nTotal number of electrons (N) = 6 (C) + 3 (3H) + 14 (Si) + 9 (F) = **32 electrons**.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the number of basis functions (spatial orbitals, K)\n\nNext, we need to find the total number of basis functions provided by the 6-31G** basis set for this molecule. The `**` notation indicates that polarization functions are added to both heavy (non-hydrogen) atoms and hydrogen atoms. For Pople basis sets like 6-31G**, this means `d` functions on heavy atoms and `p` functions on hydrogens. By standard convention, these are 6 Cartesian `d` functions and 3 Cartesian `p` functions.\n\n*   **Hydrogen (H):**\n    *   The 6-31G part gives 2 basis functions for the 1s orbital (a split-valence description).\n    *   The second `*` adds a set of `p` polarization functions (p_x, p_y, p_z), which is 3 functions.\n    *   Total per H atom = 2 + 3 = 5 basis functions.\n    *   For 3 H atoms, the total is 3 × 5 = 15 basis functions.\n\n*   **Carbon (C), a second-row heavy atom:**\n    *   The 6-31G part gives 1 core (1s) and 2 sets of valence orbitals (2s, 2p), resulting in 1 + (1s + 3p) + (1s + 3p) = 9 basis functions.\n    *   The first `*` adds a set of `d` polarization functions. Using the standard 6 Cartesian d-functions (d_xx, d_yy, d_zz, d_xy, d_xz, d_yz), this adds 6 functions.\n    *   Total per C atom = 9 + 6 = 15 basis functions.\n\n*   **Fluorine (F), a second-row heavy atom:**\n    *   The counting is identical to Carbon.\n    *   Total per F atom = 9 + 6 = 15 basis functions.\n\n*   **Silicon (Si), a third-row heavy atom:**\n    *   The 6-31G part describes the core (1s, 2s, 2p) and valence (3s, 3p) shells. This results in 5 core functions (1s, 2s, 3x2p) and 2 sets of valence functions (1s+3p each), giving a total of 5 + (1+3) + (1+3) = 13 basis functions.\n    *   The first `*` adds a set of 6 Cartesian `d` functions.\n    *   Total per Si atom = 13 + 6 = 19 basis functions.\n\n*   **Total basis functions (K):**\n    *   K = (basis functions from C) + (from 3H) + (from F) + (from Si)\n    *   K = 15 + 15 + 15 + 19 = **64 basis functions (spatial orbitals)**.\n\n### Step 3: Choose the correct formula for the number of CSFs\n\nA full CI calculation for a closed-shell molecule like $\\mathrm{CH}_2 \\mathrm{SiHF}$ typically refers to the singlet ground state (total spin S=0). For a system with N electrons in K spatial orbitals and a total spin S, the number of CSFs can be calculated using the genealogical formula (derived from Kotani's work):\n\n$N_{CSF}(K, N, S) = \\binom{K}{N/2 - S} \\binom{K}{N/2 + S} - \\binom{K}{N/2 - S - 1} \\binom{K}{N/2 + S + 1}$\n\nFor a singlet state, S=0, so the formula simplifies to:\n\n$N_{CSF}(S=0) = \\binom{K}{N/2}^2 - \\binom{K}{N/2 - 1} \\binom{K}{N/2 + 1}$\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the number of CSFs\n\nNow we substitute the values N=32 (so N/2=16) and K=64 into the formula:\n\n$N_{CSF} = \\binom{64}{16}^2 - \\binom{64}{15} \\binom{64}{17}$\n\nWe need to compute the binomial coefficients:\n*   $\\binom{64}{16} = \\frac{64!}{16! \\cdot 48!} = 2,575,343,446,550$\n*   $\\binom{64}{15} = \\frac{64!}{15! \\cdot 49!} = 868,793,644,150$\n*   $\\binom{64}{17} = \\frac{64!}{17! \\cdot 47!} = 7,271,560,416,000$\n\nNow substitute these values back into the equation:\n\n$N_{CSF} = (2,575,343,446,550)^2 - (868,793,644,150) \\times (7,271,560,416,000)$\n\n$N_{CSF} = 6,632,400,880,148,785,002,500 - 6,318,002,200,506,776,400,000$\n\n$N_{CSF} = 314,400,660,098,107,362,500$\n\nThis is the total number of singlet configuration state functions for the specified molecule and basis set in a full CI calculation."
