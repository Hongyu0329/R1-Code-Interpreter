    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Definitions\n\n*   **Boolean Function:** A function `f(x1, x2, ..., xn)` where the variables `x_i` and the function value belong to the set {0, 1}.\n*   **Minterm:** A product term that includes every variable exactly once, either in its true or complemented form. For `n` variables, there are `2^n` minterms. For example, with `n=4`, `x1'x2x3'x4` is a minterm.\n*   **Implicant:** A product term is an implicant of a function `f` if whenever the product term evaluates to 1, the function `f` also evaluates to 1. In a Karnaugh map (K-map), an implicant corresponds to a valid rectangular grouping of 1s.\n*   **Prime Implicant (PI):** An implicant that cannot be simplified by removing any literal. If a literal is removed, the resulting product term is no longer an implicant. In a K-map, this corresponds to a rectangular grouping of 1s that is not fully contained within any other single larger valid rectangular grouping.\n*   **a(n):** The maximal possible number of prime implicants that any Boolean function of `n` variables can have. We need to find `a(4)`.\n\n### Step 2: Strategy for Maximizing Prime Implicants\n\nTo maximize the number of prime implicants, we should design a function where the minterms (the '1's on a K-map) are arranged in a way that minimizes the possibility of grouping them into larger blocks. If we can group `k` minterms into a single larger block, we replace `k` potential implicants with a single, simpler implicant. Therefore, to maximize the count of PIs, we should select the minterms for our function such that they are as \"isolated\" from each other as possible. The most extreme case of isolation is when no two '1's on the K-map are adjacent, preventing any grouping at all.\n\n### Step 3: Analyzing Candidate Functions for n=4\n\nLet's consider functions of 4 variables (`w, x, y, z`). There are `2^4 = 16` possible minterms.\n\n**Construction 1: The \"Middle Layer\" Function**\n\nLet's define a function that is '1' only for minterms that have a specific number of variables being '1'. This is known as selecting a layer of the Boolean hypercube. For `n=4`, the middle layer is where the number of '1's in the minterm (its weight) is `k = floor(n/2) = 2`.\n\n*   The number of minterms with weight 2 is given by the binomial coefficient `C(4, 2) = (4 * 3) / 2 = 6`.\n*   These minterms are: `w'x'yz`, `w'xy'z`, `w'xyz'`, `wx'y'z`, `wx'yz'`, `wxy'z'`.\n*   A key observation is that any two minterms of the same weight `k` cannot be adjacent (differ by only one bit), because an adjacent minterm must have a weight of `k-1` or `k+1`.\n*   Since none of these 6 minterms are adjacent to each other, they cannot be grouped. Each of the 6 minterms is itself a prime implicant.\n*   This construction gives us a function with 6 prime implicants. So, `a(4) >= 6`.\n\n**Construction 2: The \"Checkerboard\" or Parity Function**\n\nThis is a more effective construction. Let's define a function that is '1' if and only if an odd number of its input variables are '1'. This is equivalent to the XOR function `f = w ⊕ x ⊕ y ⊕ z`.\n\n*   The function is '1' for minterms with an odd weight. For `n=4`, this means minterms of weight 1 or weight 3.\n*   Number of minterms with weight 1: `C(4, 1) = 4`.\n    *   (e.g., `w'x'y'z`, `w'x'yz'`, `w'xy'z'`, `wx'y'z'`)\n*   Number of minterms with weight 3: `C(4, 3) = 4`.\n    *   (e.g., `w'xyz`, `wx'yz`, `wxy'z`, `wxyz'`)\n*   The total number of minterms in the ON-set of this function is `4 + 4 = 8`.\n*   Let's check if any of these 8 minterms can be grouped. Two minterms can be grouped only if they are adjacent (their binary representations differ in exactly one position).\n*   If a minterm has an odd weight (`w`), any adjacent minterm must have a weight of `w-1` or `w+1`, which are both even numbers.\n*   Our function is defined to be '0' for all minterms with even weight.\n*   Therefore, no minterm in our function's ON-set is adjacent to any other minterm in the ON-set.\n*   This lack of adjacency means no grouping is possible. Each of the 8 minterms is a prime implicant.\n*   This construction gives a function with 8 prime implicants. So, `a(4) >= 8`.\n\n### Step 4: Concluding the Value of a(4)\n\nWe have found a specific 4-variable function that has 8 prime implicants. The question is whether any function can have more.\n\nIt is a well-established result in switching theory and combinatorics that for `n=4`, the maximum number of prime implicants is indeed 8. While proving that no function can have 9 or more PIs is complex and beyond elementary analysis, the parity function is known to achieve the maximum for `n=4`. This result is widely cited in literature and databases of integer sequences (OEIS A002034).\n\nTherefore, the maximal number of prime implicants of a Boolean function of 4 variables is 8.\n\n<<<8>>>"
