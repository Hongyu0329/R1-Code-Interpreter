To be functionally accurate, the picnic table shaped like an azobenzene molecule must change its shape in response to sunlight. At sunrise, upon exposure to the UV radiation in sunlight, the table should transform from a flat shape (representing the stable *trans*-isomer) into a bent or V-shape (representing the *cis*-isomer). At sunset, as the UV light fades, the table should spontaneously and thermally relax back from its bent shape to the flat shape.
