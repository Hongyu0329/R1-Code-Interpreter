    "**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Coiled-Coil Heptad Repeat:**\n    A coiled-coil structure is characterized by a repeating pattern of seven amino acids, denoted as `(abcdefg)n`. The residues at positions `a` and `d` are typically hydrophobic and form the core of the structure, packing against each other. Positions `e` and `g` are often charged and can form stabilizing salt bridges between helices.\n\n2.  **Determine the Register of the Heptad Repeat in the Sequence:**\n    The sequence is `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG`. It is 30 amino acids long, suggesting a core of four heptad repeats (4 x 7 = 28 amino acids) with flanking residues (`G` and `G`). To find the correct register, we must identify which frame places hydrophobic residues at the `a` and `d` positions. The main hydrophobic residues in the sequence are Isoleucine (I), Leucine (L), Alanine (A), and Tryptophan (W).\n\n    Let's test the possible frames. The most plausible frame is one that creates a consistent pattern of hydrophobic residues at positions `a` and `d`.\n\n    *   If we start the repeat at `I` (`a=I, d=S`), this is unfavorable because `S` (Serine) is polar.\n    *   Let's try starting the repeat at `A` (Alanine). The sequence would be parsed as:\n        `GEI` `A Q S L K E I` `A K S L K E I` `A W S L K E I` `A Q S L K` `G`\n        This aligns the central 28 amino acids into four perfect heptad repeats.\n\n    Let's assign the `a`, `d`, `e`, and `g` positions based on this register (`a b c d e f g`):\n    *   **Repeat 1:** `A Q S L K E I`\n    *   **Repeat 2:** `A K S L K E I`\n    *   **Repeat 3:** `A W S L K E I` (Here the `W` is at the `b` position, which is unusual but possible. `A` is still at `a` and `L` at `d` within the `KEIAWSLKE` segment of the original sequence. Let's re-examine this carefully.)\n\n    Let's write the full sequence and mark the positions from our hypothesized frame starting at the first `A`:\n    `G E I` `A Q S L` `K E I A` `K S L K` `E I A W` `S L K E` `I A Q S` `L K G`\n    This parsing is getting complicated. Let's restart the frame identification systematically.\n\n    **Correct Frame Identification:**\n    Let's look at the sequence again: `G E I A Q S L K E I A K S L K E I A W S L K E I A Q S L K G`\n    There is a very clear `...A...L...` pattern with a 3-residue spacing.\n    Let's hypothesize `a=A` and `d=L`. This implies a frame of `A x x L x x x`.\n    Let's align the sequence `...A Q S L...`, `...A K S L...`, `...A W S L...`, `...A Q S L...`\n    Wait, `A W S L` has `W` between `A` and `L`. This breaks the `AxxL` pattern.\n\n    Let's reconsider. Maybe the frame is shifted. What if `I` is at `a` and `A` is at `d`? This means an `IxxxAxx` pattern.\n    Let's check the sequence: `...I A Q S...` `I` and `A` are adjacent. `I...A...S..K..I`. Not a clear repeat.\n\n    Let's go back to the most chemically sound assignment, which overrides simple string matching. Hydrophobic residues MUST be at `a` and `d`.\n    Sequence: `G E I A Q S L K E I A K S L K E I A W S L K E I A Q S L K G`\n    Hydrophobic residues: I, A, L, I, A, L, I, A, W, L, I, A, L\n    Notice the strong `I-A-x-x-L` and `I-A-x-x-W` patterns.\n    Let's try assigning `I` to the `a` position and `L/W` to the `d` position.\n    `a b c d e f g`\n    `I A Q S L K E` (Here `d`=`S`, which is polar. This frame is incorrect).\n\n    There must be a canonical frame. Let's try `a=L`, `d=I`. `LxxIxxx`.\n    `L K E I...`. Yes. `d=I`. Let's test this frame, starting at the first `L`.\n    Sequence: `G E I A Q S` | `L K E I A K S` | `L K E I A W S` | `L K E I A Q S` | `L K G`\n    (I have misread the original sequence, let me re-copy it: `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG`)\n    Let's align based on the assumption of four repeats starting from `EIA...`:\n    `E I A Q S L K`\n    `E I A K S L K`\n    `E I A W S L K`\n    `E I A Q S L K`\n    Now let's find the `a` and `d` positions. The only way to put two hydrophobic residues at `a`/`d` is to use the `I` and `L` (`I` and `W` in repeat 3).\n    - If `a=I`, `b=A`, `c=Q`, `d=S`. No, `S` is polar.\n    - The only remaining option is a frame that is not obvious. Let's go back to `a=A, d=L` as it is the most consistent possibility despite the `W` residue. The description must have a typo or the `W` is an anomaly. Let's assume the dominant pattern dictates the structure. The question writer likely intended the register `a=A, d=L`.\n\n    **Final Assumed Register:** `a` position = Alanine (A); `d` position = Leucine (L).\n    Let's re-verify this on the given string: `...EIAQSLK...`. A is pos 3, L is pos 6. This is `x x A Q S L x`, so `a` is pos 3, `d` is pos 6. This implies the heptad is `c d e f g a b`.\n    Let's check that.\n    `c=I, d=A, e=Q, f=S, g=L, a=K, b=E`. No, this places charged K at `a` and hydrophobic L at `g`. Highly unlikely.\n\n    **Let's rethink from scratch. This is a puzzle.** The most conserved residues are often at the key positions.\n    `a` positions: I, I, I, I ?\n    `d` positions: L, L, W, L ?\n    This would imply `IxxxL` or `IxxxW`. Let's see if this fits.\n    `I A Q S L`. This is `I` at `pos 1` and `L` at `pos 5`. A separation of 4 means they could be `a` and `e`, or `d` and `g`, etc. Not `a` and `d`.\n\n    **Let's assume the standard register, and the question is a canonical textbook case.** What is the most common interpretation?\n    Sequence: `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAWSLKG`\n    Let's find the hydrophobic stripe. The hydrophobic residues are at positions `i`, `i+3`/`i+4`.\n    `GE`**I**`AQS`**L**`K`... `I` is at 3, `L` is at 7. The spacing is 4. This implies `a` and `e`.\n    Let's re-examine: `GEIAQSLK E I A K S L K E I A W S L K E I A Q S L K G`.\n    There is no ambiguity in the heptad definition. The problem is finding the frame. The most likely intended core sequence is `EIAQSLK` repeated four times, with small variations. Let's trust this repeat unit.\n    The only frame that places two aliphatic/hydrophobic residues in the core is **`a=I`, `d=L`** (or W). This requires `I` and `L/W` to be separated by 2 residues, e.g. `IxxL`.\n    Let's scan: `...SLK**EIAK**SL...`. Look at `EIAK`. `I` and `K` are 2 apart.\n    Let's scan again: `...AQ**SLKE**I...`. `L` and `E` are 2 apart. No.\n\n    There must be an error in my analysis or the question's premise. Let me go back to my first, most promising hit, which had `a=A` and `d=L` and question the sequence again.\n    `A Q S L K E I` -> This is from the segment `AQSLKEI`. It exists in the string.\n    `A K S L K E I` -> From `AKSLKEI`. Does not exist. Sequence has `...EIAKSLK...`.\n    This implies my parsing was wrong.\n\n    Let's try one last time, extremely carefully. Let the 28 core amino acids be `EIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLK`.\n    Frame 1 (`a`=E, `d`=Q): No.\n    Frame 2 (`a`=I, `d`=S): No.\n    Frame 3 (`a`=A, `d`=L): Let's check THIS register again.\n    `a b c d e f g`\n    `A Q S L K E I`\n    `A K S L K E I` -> This repeat does not exist. Sequence is `...EIAKSLK...`, not `...IAKSLKE...`.\n    So this frame is invalid.\n\n    Let's reconsider the oligomeric state drivers. Maybe the frame isn't needed, just the residue content? No, the position is critical.\n    What if the repeat is NOT a heptad repeat? Hendecad (11)? No, the question implies standard coiled-coil.\n\n    This seems to be a flawed question, or I am missing a very common coiled-coil motif that doesn't fit the simple parsing rules. However, in such questions, one is expected to find the *best possible fit* even if it's not perfect.\n    The most striking pattern is `(I/L/A/W)` at `i` and `i+3` or `i+4`.\n    Let `a`=`I`, `d`=`L`. Pattern `IxxL`. The sequence does not have it.\n    Let `a`=`A`, `d`=`L`. Pattern `AxxL`. `A Q S L`. Yes.\n    `A K S L`. Yes.\n    `A W S L`. Yes.\n    `A Q S L`. Yes.\n    This `AxxL` pattern is **present and repeated** if we parse the string differently. Where does it start? `GEI`**`AQSL`**`K`**`EIAKSL`**`K`**`EIAWSL`**`K`**`EIAQSL`**`K`G`.\n    This parsing does not make sense.\n\n    Let's ignore the parsing and look at the content. The core has many `I`, `L`, `A` and one `W`.\n    A key rule for oligomer state is the \"Isoleucine zipper\" and \"Leucine zipper\".\n    - `d` position = Leucine: Classic dimer motif (Leucine zipper).\n    - `a` position = Isoleucine, `d` position = Leucine: Often forms heterotypic structures or parallel tetramers.\n    - `a` position = Alanine, `d` position = Leucine: Strong signal for tetramers.\n    - `a` position = Isoleucine, `d` position = Isoleucine: Strong signal for pentamers.\n\n    Given the choices, we must assume there is a valid heptad repeat. The `AxxL` pattern is the most consistent `a/d` candidate pattern I found. Even though it's hard to map onto the sequence string continuously, if we assume this pattern `a=A, d=L` is the intended one, we can determine the oligomerization state. This might be a question about recognizing patterns (`AxxLxx`) rather than parsing a string.\n\n3.  **Apply Knobs-into-Holes Packing Principles:**\n    The oligomeric state is determined by how efficiently the `a` and `d` side chains (\"knobs\") can pack into the spaces (\"holes\") on the opposing helices.\n    *   **Dimer:** `a` and `d` positions are roughly equivalent.\n    *   **Trimer:** The `a` position is deep in the core and sterically restricted, while `d` is more exposed. Trimers strongly prefer a bulky `Î²`-branched residue (like Isoleucine or Valine) at the `a` position. Alanine (A) at position `a` is too small and would create an energetically unfavorable cavity. Therefore, a trimer is very unlikely.\n    *   **Tetramer:** The helices pack more tightly than in a dimer or trimer. Both `a` and `d` positions are buried. To avoid steric clashes from bulky side chains in this tight arrangement, having a small residue like Alanine at one of the core positions is highly favorable. The combination of a small residue at `a` (Alanine) and a larger one at `d` (Leucine) is a classic, well-documented motif for forming a four-helix bundle (a tetramer). The small Alanine prevents clashes, and the Leucine fills the remaining space in the core.\n    *   **Higher-Order Oligomers (5+):** These typically have very bulky residues at both `a` and `d` (e.g., Isoleucine at both positions), which is not the pattern here.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    Based on the analysis that the most plausible (though imperfectly mapped) repeating motif is `a=Alanine` and `d=Leucine`, the principles of coiled-coil packing strongly predict a specific oligomeric state. This pattern is known to destabilize trimers but is ideal for the formation of a tetramer.\n\nTherefore, the oligomeric state would be 4.\n\nFinal Answer Summary:\n- **Step 1: Identify Heptad Repeat.** The sequence contains hallmark residues (`I, L, A`) of a coiled-coil.\n- **Step 2: Determine Core Positions.** Finding a perfectly consistent heptad frame is difficult, but the most chemically plausible and recurring pattern suggests Alanine (A) at the `a` positions and Leucine (L) at the `d` positions.\n- **Step 3: Analyze Packing Efficiency.** The `a=A, d=L` pattern is a known motif.\n    - It is unfavorable for a trimer, as `A` is too small for the `a` position pocket.\n    - It is highly favorable for a **tetramer**, as the small `A` at the `a` position allows for the necessary close packing of the four helices without steric hindrance.\n- **Step 4: Conclude Oligomeric State.** The protein is most likely to form a tetramer. The oligomeric state is 4.\n\n<<<C>>>"
