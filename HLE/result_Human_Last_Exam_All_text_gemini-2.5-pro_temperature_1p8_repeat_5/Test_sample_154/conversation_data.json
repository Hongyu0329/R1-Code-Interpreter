    "**1. Understand the Core Concepts**\n\n*   **Simple Graph:** A graph without loops (an edge connecting a vertex to itself) or multiple edges between the same pair of vertices.\n*   **Nonisomorphic Graphs:** Graphs that have a different structure. If two graphs can be rearranged to look identical (by relabeling vertices), they are isomorphic and counted as one.\n*   **5 Vertices:** The graph has exactly five points or nodes.\n*   **2-Vertex-Connected (or Biconnected):** A connected graph that remains connected even after removing any single vertex. In other words, it has no \"cut vertices\" or \"articulation points\". A key property of 2-connected graphs is that the minimum degree of any vertex is at least 2.\n\n**2. Step-by-Step Analysis by Number of Edges (m)**\n\nWe will analyze the possible graphs by the number of edges they contain. For a graph with `n` vertices to be 2-connected, it must have at least `n` edges. Since n=5, we only need to consider graphs with 5 or more edges. The maximum number of edges in a simple graph with 5 vertices is `C(5,2) = 10` (the complete graph K5).\n\n*   **m < 5:** No graph with 5 vertices and fewer than 5 edges can be 2-connected. Graphs with `m < n-1=4` are disconnected. Graphs with `m=n-1=4` are trees, which always have cut vertices (any vertex of degree > 1 that isn't a leaf is a cut vertex). Thus, there are **0** such graphs.\n\n*   **m = 5:** For a graph with `n=5` and `m=5` to be 2-connected, every vertex must have a degree of at least 2. The only graph structure that satisfies this is the **5-cycle (C5)**, shaped like a pentagon. Removing any single vertex leaves a path of 4 vertices (P4), which is connected. So, C5 is 2-connected. There is only one nonisomorphic graph here.\n    *   **Count for m=5: 1**\n\n*   **m = 6:** We are looking for nonisomorphic graphs with 5 vertices and 6 edges that have no cut vertices. We can form such a graph by adding one edge (a \"chord\") to the C5 graph. Since all vertices in C5 are symmetric, it doesn't matter which two non-adjacent vertices we connect. The resulting graph is C5 with one chord. Let's check if it has other forms. Any other connected graph with n=5, m=6 (like a K4 with a pendant edge, or two triangles sharing a vertex) will have a cut vertex. Therefore, there's only one 2-connected graph in this category.\n    *   **Count for m=6: 1**\n\n*   **m = 7:** This case is more complex as there are more possible structures. We list all connected nonisomorphic graphs with 5 vertices and 7 edges and check each one for cut vertices. It turns out there are exactly 5 such graphs, and all of them are 2-connected. They are:\n    1.  The Fan graph F5 (a central vertex connected to the four vertices of a path P4). This can also be seen as a Wheel graph W5 with one rim edge removed.\n    2.  A graph constructed by taking two triangles that share a single vertex, and then adding an edge between the other vertices of the triangles.\n    3.  A C5 with two \"crossing\" chords (e.g., edges (1,3) and (2,4) added to a cycle 1-2-3-4-5-1).\n    4.  A complete graph K4 where one of its edges has been \"subdivided\" (i.e., the edge is replaced by a new vertex and two new edges).\n    5.  A C4 with an additional fifth vertex connected to three of the four vertices of the cycle.\n    Each of these 5 graphs can be checked and confirmed to have no cut vertices.\n    *   **Count for m=7: 5**\n\n*   **m = 8:** We can use the concept of graph complements. A graph with `n=5` and `m=8` has a complement with `n=5` and `m' = 10 - 8 = 2` edges. There are only two nonisomorphic graphs with 5 vertices and 2 edges:\n    1.  Two disjoint edges.\n    2.  Two edges sharing a vertex (a path P3).\n    The complements of both these graphs are 2-connected.\n    1.  The complement of two disjoint edges is the **Wheel graph (W5)**. Wheel graphs are 3-connected, so they are also 2-connected.\n    2.  The complement of a P3 is another 2-connected graph (isomorphic to K5 with two incident edges removed).\n    There are no other graphs with n=5, m=8.\n    *   **Count for m=8: 2**\n\n*   **m = 9:** The complement graph has `m' = 10 - 9 = 1` edge. There is only one such graph structure. The complement of this is the **complete graph K5 with one edge removed (K5-e)**. This graph is 3-connected, and therefore 2-connected.\n    *   **Count for m=9: 1**\n\n*   **m = 10:** The only graph is the **complete graph (K5)**. The complete graph Kn is (n-1)-connected. So K5 is 4-connected, which is also 2-connected.\n    *   **Count for m=10: 1**\n\n**3. Final Tally**\n\nTo find the total number of 2-vertex-connected simple nonisomorphic graphs with 5 vertices, we sum the counts from each case:\n\nTotal = (count for m=5) + (count for m=6) + (count for m=7) + (count for m=8) + (count for m=9) + (count for m=10)\nTotal = 1 + 1 + 5 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 11\n\n<<<11>>>"
