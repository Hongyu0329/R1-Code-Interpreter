    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Key Concepts\n\nFirst, we need to understand the two main concepts in the question: \"critical-level views\" and \"Arrhenius's sixth impossibility theorem\".\n\n*   **Critical-Level Views:** This is a theory in population ethics for evaluating the goodness of a population. It states that the value of a population is the sum of each person's \"utility contribution\". The contribution of a person with welfare level *u* is not simply *u*, but *u - α*, where *α* is a fixed positive value called the \"critical level\".\n    *   **Value of population = Σ (uᵢ - α)**, where uᵢ is the welfare of person *i*.\n    *   **Implication:** Adding a person to the world is a good thing only if their welfare *u* is greater than the critical level *α*. If their welfare is positive but below *α*, adding them makes the world worse from this perspective, because their contribution (u - α) is negative.\n\n*   **Arrhenius's Sixth Impossibility Theorem:** This theorem proves that it's impossible to have a population axiology (a way of ranking populations) that satisfies a specific set of five desirable, intuitive conditions simultaneously. A theory that violates at least one of these conditions can escape the impossibility, but at the cost of being counter-intuitive in some way.\n\n### Step 2: List and Understand the Conditions of the Theorem\n\nThe theorem is built on five conditions, which are the answer choices provided. Let's analyze each one.\n\n*   **A. Egalitarian Dominance:** A perfectly equal population of a certain size is better if everyone's welfare is higher. (e.g., A world of 100 people all at welfare level 80 is better than a world of 100 people all at welfare level 70). This is a very basic and widely accepted principle.\n\n*   **B. General Non-Extreme Priority:** For any high level of welfare, it's possible to find a slightly lower level of welfare such that a very large population at that slightly lower level is better than a small population at the high level. This captures the idea that numbers matter and we should prioritize helping more people, even if it's for a slightly smaller gain.\n\n*   **C. Non-Elitism:** There is no \"elite\" level of welfare that is so good that one person enjoying it is better than any number of people enjoying a slightly lower level of welfare. It ensures that quantity (the number of people) can, at least in principle, outweigh quality (the level of welfare).\n\n*   **D. Weak Non-Sadism:** An addition of a person with positive welfare (a life worth living) is always at least as good as, and never worse than, an addition of a person with negative welfare (a life not worth living).\n\n*   **E. Weak Quality Addition:** For any existing population, it is possible to make it better by adding some number of people who have a very high quality of life. This is meant to avoid the \"Sadistic Conclusion\" where adding happy people might be judged as a bad thing.\n\n### Step 3: Test Critical-Level Views Against Each Condition\n\nNow, let's see which of these conditions the critical-level view (where value = Σ(uᵢ - α) and α > 0) violates.\n\n*   **Testing Egalitarian Dominance:** Consider two populations of size N. Pop 1 is at welfare *u*, Pop 2 is at welfare *v*, with *u > v*.\n    *   Value(Pop 1) = N * (u - α)\n    *   Value(Pop 2) = N * (v - α)\n    *   Since u > v, it follows that (u - α) > (v - α). Therefore, N*(u - α) > N*(v - α).\n    *   **Conclusion:** Critical-level views **satisfy** Egalitarian Dominance.\n\n*   **Testing General Non-Extreme Priority:** The condition states that for any small population at welfare *u*, we can find a large population at a slightly lower welfare *v* that is better.\n    *   Value of small pop: n * (u - α)\n    *   Value of large pop: m * (v - α)\n    *   As long as we choose *v* such that *v > α*, the term (v - α) is positive. We can then always find a sufficiently large number of people *m* to make m * (v - α) greater than n * (u - α).\n    *   **Conclusion:** Critical-level views **satisfy** General Non-Extreme Priority.\n\n*   **Testing Non-Elitism:** This condition states there is no \"elite\" welfare level that trumps any number of people at a lower level.\n    *   Let's check if a critical-level view is elitist. Consider the critical level *α*.\n    *   Take any welfare level **u > α**. The contribution of a person at this level is (u - α), which is positive. A population of one person at this level has a positive value.\n    *   Now take any welfare level **v < α** (even if v > 0, meaning the life is worth living). The contribution of a person at this level is (v - α), which is negative.\n    *   Therefore, a population of one person at level *u* (value > 0) is considered better than **any population of any size** at level *v* (value < 0).\n    *   This is the definition of elitism. Any welfare level above *α* is an \"elite\" level compared to any welfare level below *α*.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Critical-level views **violate** Non-Elitism.\n\n*   **Testing Weak Non-Sadism:** This condition says adding a person with positive welfare (u>0) is better than adding a person with negative welfare (v<0).\n    *   Value of adding person at u: (u - α)\n    *   Value of adding person at v: (v - α)\n    *   Since u > 0 and v < 0, it is always true that u > v. Therefore (u - α) > (v - α).\n    *   **Conclusion:** Critical-level views **satisfy** Weak Non-Sadism.\n\n*   **Testing Weak Quality Addition:** This condition states we can improve a population by adding very happy people.\n    *   We need to add *n* people at a very high welfare level *u* and see if it increases the total value.\n    *   Change in value = n * (u - α).\n    *   If we choose a \"very high\" *u* such that *u > α*, then (u - α) is positive, and the total value increases. We can always choose such a *u*.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Critical-level views **satisfy** Weak Quality Addition.\n\n### Final Analysis\nThe analysis shows that critical-level views satisfy all the conditions except for one: Non-Elitism. The existence of the critical level *α* creates a sharp divide, making any welfare level above *α* lexically superior to any welfare level below *α*, which is a direct violation of Non-Elitism.\n\n<<<C>>>"
