    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the correct film.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question's Key Elements:**\n    The query asks for a specific film with several distinct, verifiable details:\n    *   **Film Type:** A Hollywood feature film.\n    *   **Production:** Produced by a major film studio.\n    *   **Character:** A teenager.\n    *   **Object:** A pink bike.\n    *   **Action:** The teenager pedals the bike directly toward an oncoming car.\n\n2.  **Initial Brainstorming and Elimination:**\n    One might first think of iconic bike scenes in teen or youth-oriented movies.\n    *   ***E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial* (1982):** Features a famous bike chase sequence. However, the bikes the main group ride are BMX-style, not pink. While they ride towards a blockade of government cars, the specific action of a single teenager on a pink bike pedaling *into* a car does not occur.\n    *   ***Footloose* (1984):** This film has a famous scene of defiance involving an oncoming vehicle. The character Ariel Moore (a teenager) stands in the path of two speeding pickup trucks. However, she is on foot, not riding a bike.\n    *   ***Pee-wee's Big Adventure* (1985):** Features an iconic bicycle, but it's red, and the protagonist is a man-child, not a teenager.\n    *   ***Now and Then* (1995):** Features teenage girls and a lot of bike riding, but no one rides a pink bike directly into a car.\n    *   ***It* (2017):** The young teen protagonists ride bikes to confront danger, but none of the bikes are pink, and this specific scene does not happen.\n\n3.  **Focusing on the Specific Combination:**\n    The combination of a \"teenager,\" a \"pink bike,\" and \"colliding with a car\" points to a scene that is highly specific and likely driven by intense emotion, such as desperation or anger. This suggests looking at dramas or dramatic comedies from the era when this type of scene would be most prominent (late 1980s-1990s).\n\n4.  **Identifying the Correct Film:**\n    The film that precisely matches all the criteria is **_Say Anything..._** (1989).\n\n5.  **Verifying Each Element in _Say Anything..._:**\n    *   **Hollywood Feature Film:** Yes, it is a well-known feature film.\n    *   **Major Film Studio:** It was produced and distributed by 20th Century Fox, a major studio.\n    *   **Teenager:** The scene involves the character **Corey Flood**, played by Lili Taylor. Corey is the best friend of the main character, Lloyd Dobler, and is a teenager who has just graduated high school.\n    *   **Pink Bike:** Corey is frequently seen with her bicycle, which is a distinctive bright pink/fuchsia girls' bike.\n    *   **Pedals Toward an Oncoming Car:** In a highly emotional scene, a distraught Corey confronts her ex-boyfriend, Joe. After he dismisses the 60+ songs she wrote for him, she gets on her pink bike in a fit of despair and deliberately pedals straight into the front bumper of his car.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe scene in _Say Anything..._ perfectly matches every detail of the user's question. The character is a teenager, the bike is pink, the studio is major, and the action involves pedaling directly toward and into a car.\n\n<<<Say Anything...>>>"
