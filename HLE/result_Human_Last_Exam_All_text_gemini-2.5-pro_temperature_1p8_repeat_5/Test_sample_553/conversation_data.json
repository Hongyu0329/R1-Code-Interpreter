    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the song.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Musical Question:**\n    *   **Artist:** The Beatles.\n    *   **Timing:** The specific chord progression must occur at the very start of the song.\n    *   **Progression:** A \"chord jump from the tonic to the minor fifth chord.\"\n\n2.  **Define the Musical Terms:**\n    *   **Tonic Chord (I or i):** This is the \"home\" chord of the song's key. For example, in the key of C Major, the tonic is a C Major chord (I). In the key of A Minor, the tonic is an A Minor chord (i).\n    *   **Fifth Chord (V or v):** This is the chord built on the fifth note of the scale.\n    *   **Minor Fifth Chord (v):** This specifically refers to a *minor* chord built on the fifth note.\n        *   In a **major key** (e.g., G Major), the fifth note is D. The standard \"dominant\" fifth chord is D Major (V). A \"minor fifth chord\" would be D Minor (v). A progression from G Major to D Minor (I → v) is a well-known modal sound.\n        *   In a **minor key** (e.g., F Minor), the fifth note is C. The diatonic chord built on this note (using the natural minor scale) is a C Minor chord (v). Therefore, a progression from F Minor to C Minor (i → v) fits the description perfectly.\n\n3.  **Search for Candidate Songs:**\n    We need to think of Beatles songs with memorable opening chords and analyze their progressions.\n\n    *   **\"A Hard Day's Night\":** Starts with a famously complex and dissonant chord (often debated, but something like a G11sus4). This is not a simple tonic-to-fifth jump.\n    *   **\"In My Life\":** The harpsichord intro is in A Major. It starts on the tonic (A) but immediately goes to the dominant major fifth (E Major). The progression is A → E → F#m (I → V → vi). This does not have a minor fifth chord at the beginning.\n    *   **\"I Feel Fine\":** Starts with feedback, then a guitar riff based on G, C, and D chords. The song is in G Major. This is a standard I-IV-V progression, not I → v.\n    *   **\"Here, There and Everywhere\":** Starts in G Major with the progression G → Am → Bm (I → ii → iii). This is not the requested progression.\n    *   **\"Michelle\":** This is a very strong candidate. Let's analyze its introduction.\n\n4.  **In-depth Analysis of \"Michelle\":**\n    *   The song is from the 1965 album *Rubber Soul*.\n    *   The key of the famous verses is **F Minor**.\n    *   Therefore, the **tonic chord (i)** is **F Minor (Fm)**.\n    *   The fifth note of the F minor scale is **C**.\n    *   The **minor fifth chord (v)** is therefore **C Minor (Cm)**.\n    *   The song begins with Paul McCartney playing a solo guitar introduction before the vocals start. The very first two chords that establish the song's harmonic feel are **Fm** followed immediately by **Cm** (often played as a first inversion, Cm/G, but the chord is still C minor).\n    *   This opening perfectly matches the description: a jump from the tonic chord (Fm) to the minor fifth chord (Cm).\n\n### Conclusion and Careful Points\n\n*   **Crucial Point 1:** The phrase \"minor fifth chord\" correctly identifies the C minor chord in the key of F minor. In a minor key, the diatonic v chord is naturally minor.\n*   **Crucial Point 2:** The progression must happen at the absolute beginning of the song. The solo guitar intro of \"Michelle\" satisfies this condition.\n*   **Crucial Point 3:** Many famous Beatles songs start with riffs or single notes, but \"Michelle\" starts with a clear chordal movement that defines the song's melancholic character.\n\nThe analysis conclusively points to \"Michelle\" as the correct answer.\n\n<<<Michelle>>>"
