    "This question requires tracing the phonological development of a Proto-Indo-European (PIE) verb form through several stages of the Germanic language family. We will analyze the changes step-by-step for each language.\n\n**Starting Point: PIE `*seh₂gieti`**\n\n*   **Root:** `*seh₂g-`\n*   **Suffix:** `*-ie-` (ye/yo-present thematic suffix)\n*   **Ending:** `*-ti` (3rd person singular primary active)\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Proto-Indo-European (PIE) to Proto-Germanic (PGmc)**\n\n1.  **Laryngeal Effect on Vowel:** The laryngeal `h₂` \"colors\" an adjacent `*e` vowel to `*a`. After coloring, the laryngeal is lost, but it lengthens the preceding vowel.\n    *   `*seh₂g-` → `*sāg-`\n\n2.  **Vowel Shift:** A defining feature of Proto-Germanic is that PIE long `*ā` becomes PGmc long `*ō`.\n    *   PIE `*sāg-` → PGmc `*sōk-` (The consonant change is next)\n\n3.  **Grimm's Law (First Consonant Shift):** This law describes a systematic shift of PIE stop consonants in Proto-Germanic.\n    *   Voiced stops become voiceless stops. Thus, PIE `*g` → PGmc `*k`.\n    *   Voiceless stops become voiceless fricatives. Thus, PIE `*t` → PGmc `*þ`.\n    *   Applying this:\n        *   Root: `*sāg-` → `*sōk-`\n        *   Ending: `-ti` → `-þi`\n    *   **Careful Point:** Verner's Law does not apply to the `*k` from `*g` here because it is a stop, not a fricative. The initial `*s` is also unaffected.\n\n4.  **Verb Morphology:** The PIE `*-ie-` suffix marks a Class I weak verb in Germanic. The infinitive would be `*sōkjaną`. The 3rd person singular present indicative form is constructed from the stem `*sōkij-` and the ending `*-iþi` or `*-iþ`.\n    *   Combining the root and the ending: `*sōk-` + `-iþ` → `*sōkiþ`.\n    *   A more precise reconstruction might be `*sōkjiþ` with the `*j` present, as this `*j` is the trigger for sound changes in the daughter languages.\n\n**Result for Proto-Germanic:** `*sōkiþ`\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Proto-Germanic (PGmc) to Old Norse (ON)**\n\n1.  **Starting Form:** PGmc `*sōkjiþ` or `*sōkiþ`\n2.  **i-Umlaut:** The high front vowel `*i` and the glide `*j` in the suffix cause the back root vowel `*ō` (`/oː/`) to be fronted. In Old Norse, `*ō` becomes `*œ` (`/øː/`).\n    *   `*sōkiþ` → `*sœ̄kiþ`\n3.  **Loss of `*j`:** The glide `*j` is lost after a long/heavy syllable (like `sōk-`). This change happens before or concurrently with i-umlaut.\n4.  **Ending Development:** The PGmc 3rd person singular ending `*-iþ` regularly develops into `-ir` in Old Norse.\n    *   `*-iþ` → `*-ið` → `*-iʀ` → `-ir`\n5.  **Syncope:** The medial vowel of the ending (`i`) is generally lost, but here the development to `-ir` is the standard reflex.\n\n**Result for Old Norse:** `sœkir`\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Proto-Germanic (PGmc) to Old English (OE)**\n\n1.  **Starting Form:** PGmc `*sōkjiþ`\n2.  **i-Umlaut (i-mutation):** As in Old Norse, the `*j` and/or `*i` trigger fronting of the root vowel. In Old English, PGmc `*ō` becomes `*ē` (`/eː/`).\n    *   `*sōkjiþ` → `*sēkjiþ`\n3.  **Palatalization:** The velar stop `*k` is palatalized to a postalveolar affricate `ċ` (`/tʃ/`) when it comes before the front glide `*j`. This is a crucial change in Old English.\n    *   `*sēkjiþ` → `*sēċjiþ`\n4.  **Syncope and Loss of `*j`:** The `*j` is lost after a long syllable, and the medial vowel `i` in the ending `*-iþ` is also syncopated (lost).\n    *   `*sēċjiþ` → `*sēċþ`\n5.  **Orthography:** The resulting form is `sēċþ`. An alternative, often later or dialectal form, is `sēceþ`, where an epenthetic vowel has been inserted to break up the final consonant cluster.\n\n**Result for Old English:** `sēċþ` (or `sēceþ`)\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Proto-Germanic (PGmc) to Old High German (OHG)**\n\n1.  **Starting Form:** PGmc `*sōkiþ`\n2.  **Old High German Vowel Breaking:** PGmc long `*ō` breaks into the diphthong `uo` in Old High German.\n    *   `*sōkiþ` → `*suokiþ`\n3.  **High German Consonant Shift (Second Sound Shift):** This is the most significant change separating OHG from the other Germanic languages.\n    *   Voiceless stops are shifted: PGmc `*k` becomes the long voiceless velar fricative `hh` (`/xː/`) when following a vowel.\n    *   Voiceless fricatives are shifted: PGmc `*þ` becomes the voiced stop `d`. In word-final position, this `d` is then devoiced to `t`.\n    *   Applying the shifts: `*suokiþ` → `suohhit` (`*k` > `hh`, `*þ` > `d` > final `t`).\n4.  **i-Umlaut:** The `i` in the ending should theoretically cause i-umlaut of the `uo` diphthong to `üe`. However, i-umlaut of back vowels is inconsistently applied and, more importantly, inconsistently represented in Old High German writing. For this verb class and root vowel, the standard literary form does not show umlaut.\n    *   **Careful Point:** While phonologically umlaut may have occurred (`*süohhit`), the attested and standard form is without it.\n\n**Result for Old High German:** `suohhit`\n\n---\n\n**Final Summary of Results:**\n\n*   **Proto-Germanic:** `*sōkiþ`\n*   **Old Norse:** `sœkir`\n*   **Old English:** `sēċþ`\n*   **Old High German:** `suohhit`\n\n<<<\nProto-Germanic: *sōkiþ\nOld Norse: sœkir\nOld English: sēċþ\nOld High German: suohhit\n>>>"
