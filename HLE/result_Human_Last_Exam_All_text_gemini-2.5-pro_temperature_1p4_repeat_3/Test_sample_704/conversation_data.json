    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The question asks for a specific musical note. This note is linked to a range of colors on Isaac Newton's colour circle.\n\n2.  **Identify the Start and End of the Colour Range:**\n    *   **Start of the range:** The question specifies \"the colour produced when combining yellow and blue\". In the context of subtractive colour mixing (like with pigments, which is the common understanding for this type of problem), mixing yellow and blue produces **green**.\n    *   **End of the range:** The question explicitly states the end of the range is **blue**.\n    *   Therefore, the question is asking for the musical note associated with the range from green to blue on Newton's colour circle.\n\n3.  **Understand Newton's Colour Circle and Musical Correspondence:**\n    *   Isaac Newton famously discovered that white light could be split into a spectrum of colours. He identified seven distinct colours: Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, Violet (ROY G BIV).\n    *   He saw an analogy between these seven colours and the seven notes of a Western diatonic musical scale (Do, Re, Mi, Fa, Sol, La, Si).\n    *   He mapped the colours to the notes, starting with Red as the lowest note. The standard correspondence is:\n        *   Red -> C (Do)\n        *   Orange -> D (Re)\n        *   Yellow -> E (Mi)\n        *   Green -> F (Fa)\n        *   **Blue -> G (Sol)**\n        *   Indigo -> A (La)\n        *   Violet -> B (Si)\n\n4.  **Determine the Note for the Specified Range:**\n    *   The question asks for the note corresponding to \"the range between\" green and blue.\n    *   On the ordered spectrum (ROY **G B** IV), the colour Blue immediately follows the colour Green.\n    *   Thus, the \"range\" that starts at the end of green and continues to the end of blue is the segment that Newton labelled as \"Blue\".\n    *   Looking at the correspondence table in Step 3, the colour Blue is mapped to the musical note **G**.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n*   **Colour Mixing Model:** It is crucial to assume subtractive colour mixing (pigments) where yellow + blue = green. Additive mixing (light) would result in a grayish-white, which would not fit the context of the colour circle.\n*   **Newton's Specific Mapping:** The answer depends specifically on Isaac Newton's proposed analogy between colour and music, not other theories.\n*   **Interpretation of \"Range Between\":** In a continuous spectrum, the \"range between\" one colour and the next refers to the second colour's segment. The segment after Green is Blue.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\n\nThe colour produced by combining yellow and blue is green. The range on Newton's colour circle between green and blue is the section designated as blue. According to Newton's mapping of colours to musical notes, the colour blue corresponds to the note G.\n\n<<<G>>>"
