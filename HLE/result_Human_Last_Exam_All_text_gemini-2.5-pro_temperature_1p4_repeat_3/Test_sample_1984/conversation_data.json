    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the differential equation and the goal.**\nThe given ordinary differential equation (ODE) is:\n$$ x'(t) = -x^{3}(t) + 2x^{2}(t) - x(t) $$\nWe are asked to find the value of $m - 2^{4048}$, where $m$ is the number of stable equilibrium points of this equation.\n\n**Step 2: Find the equilibrium points.**\nEquilibrium points (or critical points) are the constant solutions to the ODE. They are found by setting the derivative $x'(t)$ to zero. Let $f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 - x$. We need to solve the equation $f(x) = 0$.\n$$ -x^3 + 2x^2 - x = 0 $$\nFirst, factor out $-x$ from the expression:\n$$ -x(x^2 - 2x + 1) = 0 $$\nThe quadratic term in the parentheses is a perfect square: $(x-1)^2$. So the equation becomes:\n$$ -x(x-1)^2 = 0 $$\nThe solutions to this equation are the values of $x$ that make either factor equal to zero:\n*   $-x = 0 \\implies x = 0$\n*   $(x-1)^2 = 0 \\implies x - 1 = 0 \\implies x = 1$\nSo, the equilibrium points are $x_1 = 0$ and $x_2 = 1$.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the stability of each equilibrium point.**\nTo determine the stability of an equilibrium point $x^*$, we can analyze the sign of the derivative of the right-hand side, $f'(x)$, at that point. The stability criteria are:\n*   If $f'(x^*) < 0$, the equilibrium is stable (asymptotically stable).\n*   If $f'(x^*) > 0$, the equilibrium is unstable.\n*   If $f'(x^*) = 0$, the test is inconclusive, and we must use another method, like a phase line analysis.\n\nFirst, let's find the derivative of $f(x)$:\n$$ f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 - x $$\n$$ f'(x) = -3x^2 + 4x - 1 $$\nNow, we evaluate $f'(x)$ at each equilibrium point:\n\n*   **For the equilibrium point $x_1 = 0$:**\n    $$ f'(0) = -3(0)^2 + 4(0) - 1 = -1 $$\n    Since $f'(0) = -1 < 0$, the equilibrium point $x = 0$ is **stable**.\n\n*   **For the equilibrium point $x_2 = 1$:**\n    $$ f'(1) = -3(1)^2 + 4(1) - 1 = -3 + 4 - 1 = 0 $$\n    Since $f'(1) = 0$, this test is inconclusive.\n\n**Step 4: Use phase line analysis for the inconclusive case.**\nSince the derivative test failed for $x = 1$, we must analyze the sign of $f(x) = -x(x-1)^2$ in the vicinity of $x=1$ to determine its stability.\nWe check the sign of $f(x)$ on either side of $x=1$.\n\n*   **To the left of $x = 1$ (e.g., for $x$ in the interval $(0, 1)$):**\n    Let's pick a test point, say $x = 0.5$.\n    The term $(x-1)^2$ is always positive for $x \\neq 1$.\n    The term $-x$ is negative for $x > 0$.\n    So, $f(0.5) = -(0.5)(0.5-1)^2 = (-)(+) = \\text{negative}$.\n    Since $f(x) < 0$, $x'(t)$ is negative, which means solutions that start just to the left of 1 will decrease, moving *away* from $x=1$.\n\n*   **To the right of $x = 1$ (e.g., for $x > 1$):**\n    Let's pick a test point, say $x = 2$.\n    The term $(x-1)^2$ is positive.\n    The term $-x$ is negative.\n    So, $f(2) = -(2)(2-1)^2 = (-)(+) = \\text{negative}$.\n    Since $f(x) < 0$, $x'(t)$ is negative, which means solutions that start just to the right of 1 will decrease, moving *towards* $x=1$.\n\n**Careful Point:** For an equilibrium point to be classified as stable, solutions on *both* sides must converge to it. At $x=1$, solutions from the right converge to it, but solutions from the left move away from it. This type of equilibrium is called **semi-stable** or **half-stable**. In standard classifications, a semi-stable point is not considered stable.\n\nThus, the only stable equilibrium point is $x=0$.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the final result.**\nThe number of stable equilibrium points is $m=1$.\nWe are asked to find the value of $m - 2^{4048}$.\nSubstituting $m=1$ into the expression:\n$$ 1 - 2^{4048} $$\n\nThe final answer is $1 - 2^{4048}$.\n\n<<<1 - 2^{4048}>>>"
