    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the first winner of the Academy Award for Best Picture to depict a Luxor Obelisk on-screen.\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Core Elements of the Question**\n\nFirst, we must break down the question into its key components:\n1.  **\"Academy Award for Best Picture\":** We must only consider films that have won this specific award, not nominees or winners of other categories.\n2.  **\"First winner\":** The analysis must be done chronologically, starting from the first-ever Best Picture winner. The first film on that list to meet the criteria is the answer.\n3.  **\"Luxor Obelisk\":** This is the object that must appear on-screen. It's crucial to know where these obelisks are located. There are two:\n    *   One stands at the entrance of the Luxor Temple in Luxor, Egypt.\n    *   The other was transported to Paris, France, in the 1830s and now stands in the center of the Place de la Concorde.\n\nTherefore, we are looking for the first Best Picture-winning film that features scenes set in either Luxor, Egypt (at the temple) or Paris, France (at the Place de la Concorde).\n\n### **Step 2: Chronological Analysis of Best Picture Winners**\n\nWe will now review the Best Picture winners in the order they won, checking their settings and potential for depicting one of the obelisks.\n\n*   **1st (1927/1928) - *Wings***: Set during World War I. While some scenes take place in Paris with soldiers on leave, the focus is on personal drama and aerial combat. The film does not feature prominent, establishing shots of Parisian landmarks like the Place de la Concorde.\n*   **2nd (1928/1929) to 9th (1936) Winners:** This period includes *The Broadway Melody* (New York), *All Quiet on the Western Front* (German Front), *Cimarron* (American West), *Grand Hotel* (Berlin), *Cavalcade* (London), *It Happened One Night* (USA), *Mutiny on the Bounty* (At Sea/Tahiti), and *The Great Ziegfeld* (New York). None of these films are set in Paris or Luxor.\n*   **10th (1937) - *The Life of Emile Zola***: This biographical film is set almost entirely in **Paris, France**. It chronicles the life of the famous French writer and his involvement in the Dreyfus Affair, a major public and political scandal in late 19th-century France. As a historical drama aiming to recreate the era, the film uses shots of famous Parisian landmarks to establish its setting. **The Place de la Concorde, with its iconic Luxor Obelisk, is shown in the film**, notably during the film's conclusion depicting Zola's funeral procession. Since no previous Best Picture winner features either the Paris or Luxor obelisk, this film is our primary candidate.\n*   **Subsequent Winners:** We can check later winners to confirm that *The Life of Emile Zola* is indeed the first.\n    *   ***An American in Paris*** **(1951):** This musical is famous for its visual celebration of Paris and prominently features the Place de la Concorde and its obelisk. However, it won 14 years after *The Life of Emile Zola*.\n    *   ***Around the World in 80 Days*** **(1956):** The film's journey begins in London and includes a brief stop in Paris, where the Place de la Concorde can be seen. This film also won long after *The Life of Emile Zola*.\n    *   ***Lawrence of Arabia*** **(1962):** While set in the Middle East and featuring scenes in Egypt (Cairo and the Suez Canal), it does not depict the Luxor Temple.\n    *   ***Cleopatra*** **(1963):** This film famously depicts ancient Egypt, but it was only a nominee for Best Picture; it did not win. *Tom Jones* was the winner that year.\n\n### **Step 3: Conclusion**\n\nBased on the chronological review, the first Best Picture winner to be set in a location with a Luxor Obelisk is *The Life of Emile Zola*. The film uses shots of Paris, including the Place de la Concorde where one of the two obelisks is located, to establish its setting. All prior winners were set in locations that do not have a Luxor Obelisk.\n\n<<<The Life of Emile Zola>>>"
