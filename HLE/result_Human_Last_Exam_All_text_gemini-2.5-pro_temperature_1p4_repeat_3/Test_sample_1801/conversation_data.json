    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The question asks to identify two specific individuals who meet several criteria:\n    *   They are Nobel laureates.\n    *   They were featured in a commercial for the company Enron.\n    *   The commercial was from the year 2000.\n    *   The commercial was part of a campaign with the tagline \"Ask Why.\"\n    *   The commercial is described as \"infamous,\" which alludes to Enron's subsequent collapse and the irony of these respected figures endorsing the company.\n\n2.  **Contextualize the \"Infamous\" Nature:** The Enron scandal, which came to light in late 2001, was one of the largest corporate frauds in U.S. history. The company, which had been presented as a model of innovation, was revealed to be built on systemic accounting fraud. Therefore, any advertising from the period just before its collapse, especially ads that used respected figures to build a reputation of intelligence and trustworthiness, became infamous in hindsight.\n\n3.  **Research the \"Ask Why\" Campaign:** A search for \"Enron Ask Why commercial 2000\" confirms that Enron did run a high-profile advertising campaign with this tagline. The campaign's purpose was to brand Enron as a forward-thinking, intelligent company that was revolutionizing the energy industry and beyond by questioning the status quo. To support this image, they featured prominent intellectuals.\n\n4.  **Identify the Featured Individuals:** Research into this specific campaign consistently reveals that two prominent economists were featured in separate spots. These individuals were Myron Scholes and Paul Krugman.\n\n5.  **Verify their Nobel Laureate Status (Careful Point):** This is a crucial step to ensure they fit the primary criterion of the question.\n    *   **Myron Scholes:** He, along with Robert C. Merton, was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 1997 for developing a new method to determine the value of derivatives (the Black-Scholes model). As the commercial aired in 2000, he was already a Nobel laureate at the time of filming.\n    *   **Paul Krugman:** He was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 2008 for his work on international trade theory and economic geography. **Crucial Point:** At the time he appeared in the 2000 Enron commercial, he was a prominent and highly respected economist at Princeton University, but he had *not yet* won the Nobel Prize. However, since the question asks which two \"Nobel laureates\" were featured (using their current status), and he did eventually win the prize, he correctly fits the description.\n\n6.  **Synthesize the Final Answer:** Based on the analysis, the two individuals who were featured in Enron's 2000 \"Ask Why\" ad campaign and are Nobel laureates are Myron Scholes and Paul Krugman. Their participation became infamous after Enron's collapse, serving as a cautionary tale about reputation and due diligence.\n\n<<<Myron Scholes and Paul Krugman>>>"
