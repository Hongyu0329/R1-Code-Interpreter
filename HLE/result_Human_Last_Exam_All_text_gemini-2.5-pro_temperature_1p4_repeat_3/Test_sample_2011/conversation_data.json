    "This problem asks for the maximum number of different clique sizes that can exist as induced subgraphs within a single graph on n=128 vertices.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Graph:** We are working with a simple, undirected graph `G`.\n    *   **Vertices:** The number of vertices is fixed, `n = 128`.\n    *   **Clique:** A clique is a subset of vertices where every two distinct vertices are adjacent. A clique with `k` vertices is denoted `K_k`.\n    *   **Induced Subgraph:** For a subset of vertices `S`, the induced subgraph `G[S]` consists of the vertices in `S` and *all* edges from the original graph `G` that connect two vertices in `S`.\n    *   **Goal:** We need to find the maximum value of `m`, where `{s_1, s_2, ..., s_m}` is the set of distinct integers such that for each `s_i`, `G` contains an induced subgraph isomorphic to `K_{s_i}`. We want to find the graph `G` on 128 vertices that makes `m` as large as possible.\n\n2.  **Exploring a Simple Construction:**\n    *   Let's consider a simple candidate graph: the complete graph on 128 vertices, `G = K_{128}`.\n    *   This graph has exactly `n=128` vertices.\n    *   Now, let's determine the set of clique sizes that appear as induced subgraphs in `K_{128}`.\n    *   Consider any integer `s` such that `1 <= s <= 128`.\n    *   Can we find an induced `K_s` in `K_{128}`? Yes.\n    *   To do this, simply choose any subset `S` of `s` vertices from the 128 available vertices.\n    *   The subgraph induced by this set `S`, which is `G[S]`, will have `s` vertices. Since the original graph `G = K_{128}` is complete, every vertex in `S` is connected to every other vertex in `S`.\n    *   Therefore, the induced subgraph `G[S]` is a complete graph on `s` vertices, i.e., a `K_s`.\n    *   Since we can do this for any `s` from 1 to 128, the set of all possible induced clique sizes in `K_{128}` is `{1, 2, 3, ..., 128}`.\n    *   The number of different clique sizes in this set is 128.\n\n3.  **Establishing the Maximum:**\n    *   We have found a graph that exhibits 128 different clique sizes. Can any graph on 128 vertices have more?\n    *   A clique of size `s` by definition contains `s` vertices.\n    *   A graph with only `n=128` vertices cannot contain a clique of size greater than 128.\n    *   This means that for any graph `G` on 128 vertices, the set of its induced clique sizes must be a subset of `{1, 2, ..., 128}`.\n    *   The maximum possible number of elements in such a set is 128.\n    *   Since our construction of `G = K_{128}` achieves this upper bound, the maximum possible number of different clique sizes is 128.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n1.  **Induced Subgraph vs. Subgraph for Cliques:** The question specifies \"induced subgraphs\". For cliques, this distinction is not critical. If a graph has a `K_k` as a subgraph, the vertices of that `K_k` are all pairwise adjacent. The subgraph induced by those same vertices will also be a `K_k`. The term \"induced\" is crucial for other subgraph types (like paths or cycles) but doesn't change the problem for cliques.\n\n2.  **\"Clique\" vs. \"Maximal Clique\":** This is the most significant potential ambiguity. In graph theory, a \"clique\" is any complete subgraph. A \"maximal clique\" is a clique that cannot be extended by adding any other vertex from the graph. If the question had asked for the maximum number of *maximal* clique sizes, the analysis would be different:\n    *   **Alternate Problem:** Find the maximum number of different *maximal* clique sizes.\n    *   **Construction:** A good way to create a graph with many different maximal clique sizes is to use a disjoint union of cliques. For example, `G = K_{s_1} + K_{s_2} + ... + K_{s_m}`. In this graph, the components themselves are the maximal cliques.\n    *   **Optimization:** To maximize `m` (the number of different sizes), we need `s_1 + s_2 + ... + s_m <= 128`. We should choose the smallest distinct positive integers for the sizes: `1, 2, 3, ...`.\n    *   **Calculation:** We must find the largest `m` such that the sum `1 + 2 + ... + m <= 128`. This sum is `m(m+1)/2`.\n        *   `m(m+1)/2 <= 128`\n        *   `m(m+1) <= 256`\n        *   For `m=15`, `15 * 16 = 240 <= 256`. (This works).\n        *   For `m=16`, `16 * 17 = 272 > 256`. (This doesn't work).\n    *   So, under this \"maximal clique\" interpretation, the answer would be 15. However, the question uses the standard term \"clique\", not \"maximal clique\". Therefore, the literal interpretation is the correct one.\n\n### Final Answer Acquisition\n\nThe problem asks for the maximum number of different clique sizes that can appear as induced subgraphs.\n1.  Let the graph be `G` with `|V(G)| = n = 128`.\n2.  Let `S(G)` be the set of integers `k` for which `G` has an induced subgraph isomorphic to `K_k`. We want to maximize `|S(G)|`.\n3.  Any clique of size `k` requires `k` vertices, so for any `k` in `S(G)`, it must be that `k <= n = 128`. This means `S(G)` is a subset of `{1, 2, ..., 128}`, so `|S(G)| <= 128`.\n4.  Consider the complete graph `G = K_{128}`. For any integer `k` in `{1, 2, ..., 128}`, any subset of `k` vertices from `K_{128}` induces a `K_k`.\n5.  Therefore, for `G = K_{128}`, the set of induced clique sizes is `S(K_{128}) = {1, 2, ..., 128}`.\n6.  The number of different clique sizes is `|S(K_{128})| = 128`.\n7.  Since we found a graph that achieves the theoretical maximum of 128, this is the answer.\n\n<<<128>>>"
