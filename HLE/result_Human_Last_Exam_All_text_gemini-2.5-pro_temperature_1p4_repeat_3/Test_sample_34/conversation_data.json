    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the worst suited jack to open from the button.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Game Conditions\n\n*   **Game:** 100BB No-Limit Hold'em Cash Game. This is the standard stack depth, so standard pre-flop strategies apply.\n*   **Position:** Button (BTN). This is the latest and most powerful position pre-flop (excluding the blinds). Being \"in position\" post-flop gives you a significant advantage, allowing you to play the widest range of hands profitably.\n*   **Action:** Open-raising to 2.5x. This is a standard opening size that puts pressure on the blinds without committing too much of your stack.\n*   **Rake:** Rake-free. This is a crucial detail. The absence of rake increases the total pot size and improves the pot odds for all players. For the open-raiser on the button, this means that marginal hands become slightly more profitable to play, as you get to keep 100% of the pot you win. This encourages opening an even wider range than you would in a raked game.\n\n### Step 2: Understand the Goal\n\nThe question asks for the \"worst suited jack\" that should be opened. This means we are looking for the weakest hand of the form \"JXs\" (where X is another card) that is still considered a standard, profitable open-raise in this situation. Any suited jack weaker than this would be a fold.\n\n### Step 3: List and Rank the Suited Jacks\n\nWe can list all possible suited jack combinations in descending order of their general strength:\n\n1.  **AJs (Ace-Jack suited):** A premium hand. Always an open.\n2.  **KJs (King-Jack suited):** A very strong hand. Always an open.\n3.  **QJs (Queen-Jack suited):** A strong Broadway hand. Always an open.\n4.  **JTs (Jack-Ten suited):** A strong suited connector. Always an open.\n5.  **J9s (Jack-Nine suited):** A strong suited connector. Always an open from the button.\n6.  **J8s (Jack-Eight suited):** A suited one-gapper. Still strong enough to open from the button due to flush and straight potential.\n7.  **J7s (Jack-Seven suited):** A suited two-gapper. The value diminishes, but it's still a standard open from the button.\n8.  **J6s (Jack-Six suited):** Becomes more marginal. Its primary value is in making a flush or top pair with a weak kicker.\n9.  **J5s (Jack-Five suited):** Even more marginal, but has niche straight potential (e.g., with a 2-3-4 flop).\n10. **J4s (Jack-Four suited):** Weak.\n11. **J3s (Jack-Three suited):** Very weak.\n12. **J2s (Jack-Two suited):** The weakest possible suited jack. It has the largest gap, offering almost no straight potential connecting with the jack. Its value comes almost entirely from its flush potential and the chance to hit a jack.\n\n### Step 4: Consult Game Theory Optimal (GTO) Strategy\n\nAccording to modern GTO pre-flop charts for a 100BB 6-max cash game, the button's opening range is extremely wide, often between 45% and 50% of all hands. This range is designed to put maximum pressure on the blinds and leverage the positional advantage.\n\n*   In a standard (raked) game, a typical button opening range includes **all suited jacks**, from AJs down to J2s. The ability to make flushes, combined with the positional advantage, makes even the weakest suited jacks profitable to open.\n*   In a **rake-free** game, the profitability of every hand increases slightly. This means that a hand like J2s, which is already a standard open, becomes an even more clear-cut and profitable open. There is no strategic reason to fold J2s while opening stronger suited jacks.\n\n### Step 5: Conclude the \"Worst\" Hand\n\nSince a GTO-based strategy dictates opening *all* suited jacks from the button in this scenario, the \"worst\" one that you *should* open is simply the weakest one on the list. The hand with the lowest raw equity and worst connectivity among all suited jacks is J2s.\n\n<<<J2s>>>"
