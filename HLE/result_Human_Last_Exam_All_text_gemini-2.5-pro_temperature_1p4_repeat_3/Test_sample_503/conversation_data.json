    "Answering this question requires translating the abstract categorical concepts into a concrete combinatorial problem. We will break down the question into several steps.\n\n### Step-by-step analysis:\n\n**1. Understanding the Category and the Objects**\n\n*   **The Simplex Category ($\\Delta$)**: The objects of this category are finite non-empty ordered sets, denoted as $[n] = \\{0, 1, \\ldots, n\\}$ for any non-negative integer $n$. The morphisms are order-preserving functions, i.e., maps $f: [m] \\to [n]$ such that if $i \\le j$ in $[m]$, then $f(i) \\le f(j)$ in $[n]$.\n*   **Locally Posetal 2-Category**: When we view $\\Delta$ as a subcategory of $\\mathsf{Pos}$ (the category of posets), we can introduce 2-morphisms. For any two parallel morphisms $f, g: [m] \\to [n]$, a 2-morphism from $f$ to $g$ exists if and only if $f(x) \\le g(x)$ for all $x \\in [m]$. This defines a partial order on the set of morphisms $\\Delta([m], [n])$, turning it into a \"hom-poset\". This structure makes $\\Delta$ a 2-category.\n\n**2. Understanding Internal Adjunctions**\n\n*   An adjunction in a 2-category between an object $A$ and an object $B$ consists of a pair of morphisms $L: A \\to B$ (the left adjoint) and $R: B \\to A$ (the right adjoint), along with two 2-morphisms: the unit $\\eta: \\mathrm{id}_A \\Rightarrow R \\circ L$ and the counit $\\epsilon: L \\circ R \\Rightarrow \\mathrm{id}_B$.\n*   In our specific context of $\\Delta$, we are looking for an adjunction from $[m]$ to $[n]$, where $m=23$ and $n=37$.\n    *   The objects are $[23]$ and $[37]$.\n    *   The morphisms are order-preserving maps $L: [23] \\to [37]$ and $R: [37] \\to [23]$.\n    *   The 2-morphism conditions translate to pointwise inequalities:\n        *   Unit ($\\eta$): $\\mathrm{id}_{[23]} \\le R \\circ L$, which means $x \\le R(L(x))$ for all $x \\in [23]$.\n        *   Counit ($\\epsilon$): $L \\circ R \\le \\mathrm{id}_{[37]}$, which means $L(R(y)) \\le y$ for all $y \\in [37]$.\n*   **Careful Point**: In any posetal 2-category, the triangle identities for the unit and counit are automatically satisfied if the unit and counit exist.\n*   The two conditions above are equivalent to the more common definition of an adjunction between posets (also known as a Galois connection): for all $x \\in [23]$ and $y \\in [37]$, the following equivalence holds:\n    $L(x) \\le y \\iff x \\le R(y)$.\n\n**3. Characterizing Adjoint Maps**\n\nAn adjunction is determined by either the left adjoint $L$ or the right adjoint $R$. We can count the number of valid maps of one type.\n\n*   **Counting Left Adjoints ($L$):**\n    A map $L: [23] \\to [37]$ is a left adjoint if and only if a corresponding right adjoint $R$ exists. The formula for $R$ in terms of $L$ is $R(y) = \\max\\{x \\in [23] \\mid L(x) \\le y\\}$. For $R$ to be a well-defined map from $[37]$ to $[23]$, the set $\\{x \\in [23] \\mid L(x) \\le y\\}$ must be non-empty for all $y \\in [37]$.\n    *   Let's check this condition. If we take $y=0$, the set is $\\{x \\in [23] \\mid L(x) \\le 0\\}$, which is $\\{x \\in [23] \\mid L(x) = 0\\}$. This set could be empty.\n    *   If we assume $L(0)=0$, then for any $y \\in [37]$, we have $y \\ge 0 = L(0)$, so the element $0$ is always in the set $\\{x \\in [23] \\mid L(x) \\le y\\}$. Thus the set is non-empty.\n    *   In fact, the condition that $L$ has a right adjoint is equivalent to $L$ being an order-preserving map that sends $0$ to $0$. Let's prove this. In the adjunction equivalence $L(x) \\le y \\iff x \\le R(y)$, let $x=0$. We get $L(0) \\le y \\iff 0 \\le R(y)$. Since $R$ maps into $[23]$, $R(y) \\ge 0$ is always true. Thus, the right side is always true. This forces the left side, $L(0) \\le y$, to be true for all $y \\in [37]$. The only way this can hold is if $L(0)=0$.\n    *   Therefore, an internal adjunction is uniquely specified by an order-preserving map $L: [23] \\to [37]$ such that $L(0)=0$.\n\n*   **Counting Right Adjoints ($R$):**\n    Dually, a map $R: [37] \\to [23]$ is a right adjoint if it's order-preserving and preserves the top element. In the adjunction equivalence $L(x) \\le y \\iff x \\le R(y)$, let $y=37$. We get $L(x) \\le 37 \\iff x \\le R(37)$. The left side is always true since $L$ maps into $[37]$. Thus, the right side, $x \\le R(37)$, must be true for all $x \\in [23]$. This implies $23 \\le R(37)$. Since $R$ maps into $[23]$, we must have $R(37)=23$.\n    *   Therefore, an internal adjunction is also uniquely specified by an order-preserving map $R: [37] \\to [23]$ such that $R(37)=23$. Counting these should give the same result.\n\n**4. The Combinatorial Counting Problem**\n\nWe need to count the number of order-preserving maps $L: [23] \\to [37]$ with $L(0)=0$.\nSuch a map is defined by the sequence of its values:\n$L(0), L(1), \\ldots, L(23)$.\nThe conditions are:\n1.  $L(0)=0$.\n2.  $0 = L(0) \\le L(1) \\le L(2) \\le \\cdots \\le L(23)$.\n3.  The values $L(i)$ must be in $[37]$, i.e., $L(i) \\le 37$ for all $i$.\n\nThis means we need to choose the 23 values for $L(1), \\ldots, L(23)$, forming a non-decreasing sequence where each value is taken from the set $\\{0, 1, \\ldots, 37\\}$.\nThis is a classic stars-and-bars or multiset counting problem.\n*   Let the sequence be $x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_{23}$, where $x_i = L(i)$.\n*   We have the constraint: $0 \\le x_1 \\le x_2 \\le \\cdots \\le x_{23} \\le 37$.\n*   This is equivalent to choosing $k=23$ items from a set of $n=38$ possible values $\\{0, 1, \\ldots, 37\\}$ with replacement, where order is irrelevant (as it will be fixed by the non-decreasing condition).\n*   The number of ways to do this is given by the multiset coefficient formula:\n    $$ \\binom{N+k-1}{k} $$\n    Here, $k=23$ (the number of values to choose) and $N=38$ (the number of possible values).\n    The number of maps is $\\binom{38+23-1}{23} = \\binom{60}{23}$.\n\n**5. Verification using the Dual Formulation**\n\nLet's count the number of order-preserving maps $R: [37] \\to [23]$ with $R(37)=23$.\nThis requires choosing the 37 values for $R(0), \\ldots, R(36)$, such that:\n$R(0) \\le R(1) \\le \\cdots \\le R(36) \\le R(37) = 23$.\nThe values are chosen from the set $\\{0, 1, \\ldots, 23\\}$.\n*   This is a non-decreasing sequence of length $k=37$.\n*   The values are from the set $\\{0, 1, \\ldots, 23\\}$, which has $N=24$ elements.\n*   The number of maps is $\\binom{N+k-1}{k} = \\binom{24+37-1}{37} = \\binom{60}{37}$.\n*   Using the identity $\\binom{n}{k} = \\binom{n}{n-k}$, we have $\\binom{60}{37} = \\binom{60}{60-37} = \\binom{60}{23}$.\nBoth methods yield the same result, confirming our reasoning.\n\n### Final Calculation\n\nThe number of internal adjunctions is the number of such maps we've counted.\nNumber of adjunctions = $\\binom{60}{23}$.\n\n<<<\"\"\"\n$\\binom{60}{23}$\n\"\"\""
