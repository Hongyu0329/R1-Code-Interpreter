    "An analysis of the symmetries of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ involves identifying the continuous group of transformations under which the equations remain invariant. The dimension of this Lie group is equal to the dimension of its corresponding Lie algebra, which is spanned by the infinitesimal generators of these symmetry transformations.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine this dimension:\n\n**Step 1: The Incompressible Navier-Stokes Equations**\n\nFirst, let's write down the equations in question. For a velocity field $\\mathbf{u}(t, \\mathbf{x}) = (u_1, u_2, u_3)$ and a pressure field $P(t, \\mathbf{x})$ in three spatial dimensions ($\\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$) and time $t$, the equations are:\n\n1.  **Momentum Equation:** $\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}}{\\partial t} + (\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla) \\mathbf{u} = -\\nabla P + \\nu \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{u}$\n2.  **Incompressibility Condition:** $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u} = 0$\n\nHere, $\\nu$ is the constant kinematic viscosity. We seek transformations of the independent variables $(t, \\mathbf{x})$ and dependent variables $(\\mathbf{u}, P)$ that map solutions to other solutions.\n\n**Step 2: Identification of Symmetries**\n\nThe Lie group of symmetries can be found by systematically solving the \"determining equations\" derived from the Lie invariance condition. However, we can also identify the symmetries based on the physical principles the equations embody, for a system defined on the whole space $\\mathbb{R}^3$ without external forces or boundaries.\n\n*   **Time Translation (1 dimension):** The laws of physics do not depend on the absolute choice of the time origin.\n    *   Transformation: $t \\rightarrow t + s$\n    *   This gives one generator: $\\partial_t$.\n\n*   **Space Translations (3 dimensions):** The laws of physics do not depend on the absolute position in space (homogeneity of space).\n    *   Transformation: $\\mathbf{x} \\rightarrow \\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{a}$\n    *   This gives three independent generators, one for each spatial direction: $\\partial_{x_1}, \\partial_{x_2}, \\partial_{x_3}$.\n\n*   **Spatial Rotations (3 dimensions):** The laws of physics do not depend on the absolute orientation in space (isotropy of space). The equations are covariant under rotations.\n    *   Transformation: $\\mathbf{x} \\rightarrow R\\mathbf{x}$, $\\mathbf{u} \\rightarrow R\\mathbf{u}$ (where $R \\in SO(3)$ is a rotation matrix).\n    *   The group of rotations $SO(3)$ is 3-dimensional, giving three generators, one for rotations about each axis (e.g., $R_{ij} = x_j \\partial_{x_i} - x_i \\partial_{x_j} + u_j \\partial_{u_i} - u_i \\partial_{u_j}$).\n\n*   **Galilean Boosts (3 dimensions):** The equations are invariant under a transformation to a uniformly moving reference frame (Galilean relativity).\n    *   Transformation: $\\mathbf{x} \\rightarrow \\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{v}t$, $\\mathbf{u} \\rightarrow \\mathbf{u} + \\mathbf{v}$. The pressure $P$ also remains invariant.\n    *   This provides three independent generators, one for a boost in each spatial direction (e.g., $G_i = t \\partial_{x_i} + \\partial_{u_i}$).\n\n*   **Scaling (or Dilatation) (1 dimension):** This is a less obvious symmetry, specific to the structure of the Navier-Stokes equations. It arises from balancing the scaling behavior of each term in the equation. A consistent scaling transformation is found to be:\n    *   Transformation: $t \\rightarrow a^2 t$, $\\mathbf{x} \\rightarrow a \\mathbf{x}$, $\\mathbf{u} \\rightarrow a^{-1} \\mathbf{u}$, $P \\rightarrow a^{-2} P$.\n    *   This one-parameter group of transformations gives one generator: $D = 2t \\partial_t + \\sum_{i=1}^3 x_i \\partial_{x_i} - \\sum_{i=1}^3 u_i \\partial_{u_i} - 2P \\partial_P$.\n\n**Step 3: Summing the Dimensions**\n\nThe total dimension of the Lie group of symmetries is the sum of the number of independent generators from each of these subgroups.\n\n*   Time translation: 1\n*   Space translations: 3\n*   Spatial rotations: 3\n*   Galilean boosts: 3\n*   Scaling: 1\n\nTotal Dimension = $1 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 11$.\n\n**Careful Points and Verification:**\n\n1.  **Role of Viscosity:** The viscous term $\\nu \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{u}$ is crucial. Without it (i.e., for the Euler equations), the system possesses an infinite-dimensional group of symmetries related to particle relabeling. The viscous term breaks this larger symmetry group down to the finite-dimensional one calculated here.\n2.  **Role of Dimension:** The problem is specified for $\\mathbb{R}^3$. In 2D, the vorticity formulation leads to an infinite-dimensional symmetry algebra because the vortex-stretching term $(\\boldsymbol{\\omega}\\cdot\\nabla)\\mathbf{u}$ is absent. The 3D case is more constrained.\n3.  **Point Symmetries:** This analysis finds the Lie group of *point symmetries*. This is the standard interpretation of the question. More generalized symmetries could exist but are not typically considered unless specified.\n4.  **Completeness:** The set of 11 generators constitutes the complete Lie algebra of point symmetries for the 3D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. This is a well-established result in the mathematical physics literature.\n\nThe Lie algebra spanned by these 11 generators is known as the Navier-Stokes algebra. Its dimension is 11, and therefore, the dimension of the corresponding Lie group is also 11."
