    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the French equivalent of the Gaulish name \"Odobeccus\".\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Name \"Odobeccus\"**\n    *   The name \"Odobeccus\" is a Latinized form, common in Roman and post-Roman texts. The `-us` ending is a standard Latin masculine suffix that would be dropped in the evolution to French.\n    *   This leaves us with the core name: **Odobecc**.\n    *   This core name is a compound, typical of both Gaulish and Germanic naming traditions. It is composed of two parts: **Odo-** and **-becc**.\n\n2.  **Analyze the First Element: *Odo-***\n    *   **Origin**: This element is not Gaulish but Germanic, specifically Frankish. *Audo* or *Odo* was a very common element in Frankish names, meaning \"wealth,\" \"riches,\" or \"property.\" The historical figure Odobeccus was a Frankish official in the late 4th/early 5th century, which fits this origin.\n    *   **Evolution into French**: The Germanic element *Odo* evolved into French in a few ways. The most famous example is the name of the 9th-century king *Odo* of Paris, whose name in French is **Eudes**. Another common evolution of the Germanic *Audo-* element is **Aude-**.\n    *   **Careful Point**: We must consider both *Eudes* and *Aude-* as possible French outcomes for the first part of the name.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Second Element: *-becc***\n    *   **Origin**: This element comes from the Latinized form *-beccus*, which itself derives from the Gaulish word **beccos**.\n    *   **Meaning**: The Gaulish word *beccos* means \"beak\" (of a bird). This word was noted by the Roman historian Suetonius as being of Gaulish origin.\n    *   **Evolution into French**: The evolution of *beccos* into French is very direct. The final `-os` was dropped, and the double `c` sound (`/kk/`) simplified to a single `k` sound, spelled `c`. This gives the modern French word **bec**, which still means \"beak.\"\n    *   **Careful Point**: This evolution is straightforward and well-attested in the French language itself.\n\n4.  **Recombine the Evolved Elements**\n    *   Now, we combine the French versions of the two original parts.\n    *   **Option 1**: Combining *Eude-* + *-bec* gives **Eudebec**.\n    *   **Option 2**: Combining *Aude-* + *-bec* gives **Audebec**.\n\n5.  **Conclusion and Final Verification**\n    *   Both *Eudebec* and *Audebec* are linguistically sound equivalents of \"Odobeccus\".\n    *   To verify, we can check if these names exist in modern French as surnames or place names.\n    *   A search reveals that **Audebec** exists as a surname in France, particularly in Normandy. This provides strong evidence that this is the correct modern equivalent. The form *Eudebec* is less common or non-existent, making *Audebec* the most likely and attested equivalent.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the step-by-step linguistic analysis, the modern French equivalent of the name \"Odobeccus\" is **Audebec**.\n\n<<<Audebec>>>"
