    "This problem requires us to find the steady-state solution of a given Kolmogorov-Chapman system of equations. Let's denote the steady-state probabilities as $\\pi_i = P_i(+\\infty)$.\n\n### Analysis of the Question and Careful Points\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The problem asks for the sum of the steady-state probabilities for states 0 and 1, which is $\\pi_0 + \\pi_1$.\n2.  **Steady-State Condition:** In steady-state (as $t \\to +\\infty$), the probabilities no longer change with time. This means all time derivatives are zero: $P_i'(t) = 0$ for $i=0, 1, 2, 3$. This transforms the system of differential equations into a system of linear algebraic equations for the steady-state probabilities $\\pi_i$.\n3.  **System Consistency Check (Crucial Point):** For any valid continuous-time Markov chain, the total probability must be conserved, i.e., $\\sum P_i(t) = 1$. This implies that the sum of the derivatives must be zero: $\\sum P_i'(t) = 0$. Let's examine the given system:\n    *   $P_{0}'(t) = -\\lambda_{01}P_{0}(t) + \\lambda_{10}P_{1}(t)$\n    *   $P_{1}'(t) = -\\lambda_{01}P_{0}(t) - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12})P_{1}(t) + \\lambda_{21}P_{2}(t) + \\lambda_{31}P_{3}(t)$\n    *   $P_{2}'(t) = \\lambda_{12}P_{1}(t) - (\\lambda_{21}  + \\lambda_{23})P_{2}(t)$\n    *   $P_{3}'(t) = \\lambda_{23}P_{2}(t) - \\lambda_{31}P_{3}(t)$\n    Summing these equations, we get:\n    $\\sum_{i=0}^3 P_i'(t) = P_0(t)(-\\lambda_{01}-\\lambda_{01}) + P_1(t)(\\lambda_{10}-(\\lambda_{10}+\\lambda_{12})+\\lambda_{12}) + P_2(t)(\\lambda_{21}-(\\lambda_{21}+\\lambda_{23})+\\lambda_{23}) + P_3(t)(\\lambda_{31}-\\lambda_{31})$\n    $\\sum P_i'(t) = -2\\lambda_{01}P_0(t) + 0 + 0 + 0 = -2\\lambda_{01}P_0(t)$.\n    Since $\\lambda_{01}=0.019 \\neq 0$, the sum of derivatives is not zero. This indicates a typo in the provided system. In a standard Kolmogorov system, the term representing flow from state $i$ to state $j$ must appear as $+\\lambda_{ij}P_i(t)$ in the equation for $P_j'(t)$. The term $-\\lambda_{01}P_0(t)$ in the equation for $P_1'(t)$ should be positive.\n    **Assumption:** We will proceed by correcting this likely typo. The corrected equation is:\n    $P_{1}'(t) = \\mathbf{+ \\lambda_{01}}P_{0}(t) - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12})P_{1}(t) + \\lambda_{21}P_{2}(t) + \\lambda_{31}P_{3}(t)$.\n    With this correction, $\\sum P_i'(t) = 0$, and the system represents a valid Markov chain.\n4.  **Normalization:** The sum of all steady-state probabilities must equal 1: $\\pi_0 + \\pi_1 + \\pi_2 + \\pi_3 = 1$. This equation is essential for finding a unique solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution\n\n**Step 1: Write down the steady-state equations.**\nSetting the derivatives to zero and using the corrected equation for $P_1'$, we get the following system for the probabilities $\\pi_i$:\n1.  $0 = -\\lambda_{01}\\pi_0 + \\lambda_{10}\\pi_1$\n2.  $0 = \\lambda_{01}\\pi_0 - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12})\\pi_1 + \\lambda_{21}\\pi_2 + \\lambda_{31}\\pi_3$\n3.  $0 = \\lambda_{12}\\pi_1 - (\\lambda_{21} + \\lambda_{23})\\pi_2$\n4.  $0 = \\lambda_{23}\\pi_2 - \\lambda_{31}\\pi_3$\n5.  $\\pi_0 + \\pi_1 + \\pi_2 + \\pi_3 = 1$\n\n**Step 2: Substitute the numerical values of the transition rates.**\nGiven: $\\lambda_{01} = 0.019, \\lambda_{10} = 0.65, \\lambda_{12} = 0.4, \\lambda_{21} = 0.392, \\lambda_{23} = 0.008, \\lambda_{31} = 0.008$.\n1.  $0 = -0.019\\pi_0 + 0.65\\pi_1$\n2.  (This equation is linearly dependent on the others and can be ignored for solving)\n3.  $0 = 0.4\\pi_1 - (0.392 + 0.008)\\pi_2 \\implies 0 = 0.4\\pi_1 - 0.4\\pi_2$\n4.  $0 = 0.008\\pi_2 - 0.008\\pi_3$\n5.  $\\pi_0 + \\pi_1 + \\pi_2 + \\pi_3 = 1$\n\n**Step 3: Solve the system of linear equations.**\nFrom equation (4), we get:\n$0.008\\pi_2 = 0.008\\pi_3 \\implies \\pi_2 = \\pi_3$.\n\nFrom equation (3), we get:\n$0.4\\pi_1 = 0.4\\pi_2 \\implies \\pi_1 = \\pi_2$.\n\nTherefore, we have the relationship: $\\pi_1 = \\pi_2 = \\pi_3$.\n\nFrom equation (1), we express $\\pi_0$ in terms of $\\pi_1$:\n$0.019\\pi_0 = 0.65\\pi_1 \\implies \\pi_0 = \\frac{0.65}{0.019}\\pi_1 = \\frac{650}{19}\\pi_1$.\n\n**Step 4: Use the normalization equation to find the probabilities.**\nSubstitute the expressions for $\\pi_0, \\pi_2, \\pi_3$ in terms of $\\pi_1$ into the normalization equation (5):\n$\\pi_0 + \\pi_1 + \\pi_2 + \\pi_3 = 1$\n$(\\frac{650}{19}\\pi_1) + \\pi_1 + \\pi_1 + \\pi_1 = 1$\n$(\\frac{650}{19} + 3)\\pi_1 = 1$\n$(\\frac{650 + 57}{19})\\pi_1 = 1$\n$\\frac{707}{19}\\pi_1 = 1 \\implies \\pi_1 = \\frac{19}{707}$.\n\nNow we can find $\\pi_0$:\n$\\pi_0 = \\frac{650}{19}\\pi_1 = \\frac{650}{19} \\times \\frac{19}{707} = \\frac{650}{707}$.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the final answer.**\nThe problem asks for the value of $P_0(+\\infty) + P_1(+\\infty) = \\pi_0 + \\pi_1$.\n$\\pi_0 + \\pi_1 = \\frac{650}{707} + \\frac{19}{707} = \\frac{650 + 19}{707} = \\frac{669}{707}$.\n\nTo get a numerical value, we perform the division:\n$\\frac{669}{707} \\approx 0.946251768...$\nRounding to five decimal places, the result is 0.94625.\n\n<<<0.94625>>>"
