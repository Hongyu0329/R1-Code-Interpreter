The two problems are:

1.  **The Regress Problem of Justification:** The model requires knowledge to be justified by other beliefs. If these justifying beliefs must also be knowledge, it creates an impossible infinite regress. If they are just mere beliefs, the justification is too weak to produce knowledge.

2.  **The Conflation of Different Types of Non-Knowledge:** The model lumps all states that are not knowledge into the single category of "Belief". This wrongly equates a **Justified False Belief** (a rational error) with an **Unjustified True Belief** (a lucky guess), treating them as the same epistemic state and thus failing to distinguish between rational failure and irrational success.
