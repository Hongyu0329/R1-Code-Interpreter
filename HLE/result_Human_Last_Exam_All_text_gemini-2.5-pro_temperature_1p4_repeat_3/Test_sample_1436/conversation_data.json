    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the symmetry factor of the described Feynman diagram.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Diagram's Topology**\n\nThe question describes a Feynman diagram with:\n*   **Two vertices:** Let's call them V1 and V2.\n*   **Four field contractions:** In Feynman diagrams, field contractions are represented by lines (propagators).\n\nThis means the diagram consists of two points (V1 and V2) with four lines connecting them. Since no external lines are mentioned, this is a vacuum diagram. This topology is sometimes called a \"setting-sun\" or \"spectator\" diagram, though those names are more common when it's part of a larger diagram.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Relevant Interaction**\n\nFor a vertex to be connected by four lines, it must come from an interaction term in the Lagrangian that involves at least four fields. The most common and simplest such interaction is in `φ^4` theory, where the interaction Lagrangian is `L_int = (λ/4!) φ^4`. Each vertex in the diagram corresponds to one `φ^4` term. Since we have two vertices, this diagram arises from the second-order term in the perturbative expansion of the Green's function, proportional to `λ^2`.\n\n**Step 3: Define the Symmetry Factor (S)**\n\nThe symmetry factor, `S`, of a Feynman diagram is a combinatorial number that corrects for overcounting when summing all possible Wick contractions. It is equal to the order of the automorphism group of the diagram—that is, the number of ways the components of the diagram (vertices and lines) can be permuted without changing the diagram's structure.\n\n**Step 4: List and Count the Symmetries of the Diagram**\n\nWe need to identify all operations that leave the diagram unchanged.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Permutation of Identical Vertices.**\n    The two vertices are of the same type (both are `φ^4` interaction vertices). We can swap the position of V1 and V2, and the diagram, with its four connecting lines, remains identical. This is a symmetry. The number of ways to permute two identical objects is `2!`.\n    *   Contribution to S = `2! = 2`.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Permutation of Identical Propagators.**\n    There are four propagators (lines) connecting V1 and V2. These lines are topologically identical. Any permutation of these four lines among themselves will result in the same diagram. The number of ways to permute four identical objects is `4!`.\n    *   Contribution to S = `4! = 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 24`.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Combining Symmetries.**\n    The total symmetry factor is the product of the number of symmetries from all independent operations. The permutation of vertices and the permutation of lines are independent symmetries.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Final Symmetry Factor**\n\nTo get the total symmetry factor `S`, we multiply the factors from each independent symmetry operation identified in the previous step.\n\n`S = (Factor from permuting vertices) × (Factor from permuting propagators)`\n`S = 2! × 4!`\n`S = 2 × 24`\n`S = 48`\n\nTherefore, the symmetry factor associated with a Feynman diagram featuring two `φ^4` vertices connected by four propagators is 48.\n\n---\n**Final Answer Derivation**\n\n1.  **Identify Diagram:** Two vertices (V1, V2) connected by four lines.\n2.  **Source Theory:** This arises from the `(L_int)^2` term in a `φ^4` theory.\n3.  **Count Vertex Symmetries:** The two vertices are identical. Swapping them leaves the diagram invariant. This gives a factor of `2! = 2`.\n4.  **Count Line Symmetries:** The four lines connecting the vertices are identical. Permuting them leaves the diagram invariant. This gives a factor of `4! = 24`.\n5.  **Calculate Total Symmetry Factor:** Multiply the independent symmetry factors.\n    `S = 2! × 4! = 2 × 24 = 48`.\n\n<<<48>>>"
