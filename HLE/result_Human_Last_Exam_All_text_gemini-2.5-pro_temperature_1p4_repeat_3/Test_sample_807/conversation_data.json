    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Crayola crayon color.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Chemical Compound**\nThe question provides the chemical name: 9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride. The first step is to find the common name for this complex chemical structure.\n\n**Step 2: Find the Common Name and Color**\nBy searching for this IUPAC name, we can identify the compound's common name, which is **Rhodamine B**. Rhodamine B is a well-known synthetic dye. It is also classified in the Colour Index as C.I. Basic Violet 10 or C.I. 45170. As a pigment, it produces a vibrant, fluorescent, reddish-violet or magenta color.\n\n**Step 3: Connect the Pigment to Crayola Crayons**\nThe next step is to determine which Crayola crayon uses Rhodamine B (Basic Violet 10) as a pigment. This requires looking into the composition of Crayola crayons.\n*   Rhodamine B's fluorescent properties mean it is most likely to be found in very bright, neon, or fluorescent colors.\n*   Research into Crayola crayon history and pigment composition reveals several colors that have used this dye. Candidates include colors from the fluorescent/neon lines like \"Hot Magenta,\" \"Razzle Dazzle Rose,\" and \"Radical Red.\"\n*   However, the most famous and historically significant use of this pigment is in a color that was not part of a dedicated fluorescent set.\n\n**Step 4: Pinpoint the Specific Crayon Color**\nThe original **Cerise** crayon, which was included in the 64-count box from 1958 until its retirement in 1990, is widely cited as containing Rhodamine B. What makes this a notable fact in crayon history is that its fluorescent quality was unique among the standard colors of its time, causing it to appear differently under various light sources. While newer colors like \"Radical Red\" and \"Hot Magenta\" were intentionally designed as fluorescent and also contain this dye, the classic and most frequently cited answer for this specific chemical is the original Cerise. The name \"Cerise\" itself, French for \"cherry,\" describes a deep reddish-pink color, consistent with the hue of the Rhodamine B dye.\n\n<<<Cerise>>>"
