    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question and the provided answer choices.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\n\nThe question asks to identify the dance in which a \"reverse turn\" cannot be \"overturned\" without \"disregarding the technique.\"\n\n*   **Reverse Turn:** This is a standard figure in ballroom dancing that turns to the left.\n*   **Overturn:** This means to rotate more than the standard, textbook amount prescribed for the figure. For example, turning 1/2 when the figure calls for 3/8 of a turn.\n*   **Without disregarding the technique:** This is the most critical part of the question. It means that while a dancer might be physically able to force more rotation, doing so would violate the fundamental principles and characteristic actions of that specific dance. These principles include things like footwork, rise and fall, body sway, posture, and hold.\n*   **Impossible:** This implies that the very technique of the dance creates a hard limit on rotation that cannot be exceeded while still performing the dance correctly.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze each dance style based on the question's criteria.**\n\n*   **A. Viennese Waltz:** This dance is characterized by continuous, rapid rotation. While there's a standard amount of turn (one full rotation over 6 steps), dancers constantly adjust this for floorcraft (navigating around other couples). The technique of sway and rotation is built for turning, and exaggerating it to overturn is physically possible without fundamentally breaking the core idea of the dance, even if it becomes messy. It is not \"impossible.\"\n\n*   **B. English Waltz:** This is a swing dance defined by its pronounced rise and fall, body sway, and CBM (Contrary Body Movement). These technical elements are precisely the tools a dancer uses to create rotation. By exaggerating the sway and using the rise to pivot more, a dancer can intentionally overturn a figure. This is a common practice in advanced choreography. Therefore, it is not impossible.\n\n*   **D. Slow Foxtrot:** Similar to the Waltz, the Foxtrot is a smooth, gliding swing dance. It uses CBM and sway to create elegant, continuous movement. These same technical elements allow for adjustments in the amount of turn. Advanced dancers frequently modify the rotation of figures for choreography and expression. It is not impossible.\n\n*   **E. Quickstep:** This is a fast, dynamic swing dance with significant rise and fall, hops, and chasses. The energy and bounce inherent in the dance technique can be harnessed to generate powerful rotation. Overturning figures is common for styling and floorcraft. It is certainly not impossible.\n\n*   **C. European Tango:** The Tango is fundamentally different from the other four dances. It is a \"non-swing\" or \"walking\" dance. Its core, defining technique includes the following principles:\n    *   **No Rise and Fall:** The dancers maintain a constant height, moving with bent knees in a \"stalking\" manner.\n    *   **No Body Sway:** The upper body remains still and connected, without the side-to-side sway seen in swing dances.\n    *   **Staccato Action:** Movements are sharp and clipped.\n    \n    Now, consider the reverse turn in Tango. Rotation is generated from the feet and a controlled twist in the torso, but without the assistance of rise, fall, or sway. To significantly overturn the turn, a dancer would need to pivot more sharply on the supporting foot. This action almost inevitably forces the dancer to rise onto the ball of the foot to reduce friction and allow for the extra spin. This act of rising is a direct and fundamental violation of the \"no rise and fall\" technique. Therefore, it is impossible to overturn a Tango reverse turn *without disregarding the core technique of the dance*. The technique itself creates the limitation.\n\n**Step 3: Conclude the analysis**\n\nThe swing dances (Waltz, Foxtrot, Quickstep, Viennese Waltz) use techniques like sway and rise-and-fall that can be adapted to produce more rotation. The European Tango's technique is defined by the *absence* of these elements, and attempting to overturn a figure forces the dancer to violate these fundamental rules.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nBased on the analysis, the European Tango is the only dance where the core technique makes it impossible to overturn a reverse turn correctly.\n\n<<<C>>>"
