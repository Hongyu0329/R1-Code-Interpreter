    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Chessboard and Edge Squares\n*   A standard chessboard is an 8x8 grid of 64 squares.\n*   The \"edge squares\" are all the squares on the perimeter of the board. These are the squares in the 1st and 8th ranks, and the 'a' and 'h' files.\n*   To count the total number of edge squares: There are 8 squares on the top row, 8 on the bottom row, and 6 more on each of the left and right sides (since the corners are already counted).\n*   Total Edge Squares = 8 (rank 1) + 8 (rank 8) + 6 (file a) + 6 (file h) = 28 squares.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Bishop's Movement and Constraints\n*   The core rule of the puzzle is that no two bishops can be placed on squares that attack each other.\n*   Bishops move and attack along diagonals.\n*   A crucial point about bishops is that they are \"color-bound\": a bishop on a white square can only ever move to and attack other white squares. A bishop on a black square can only ever move to and attack other black squares.\n*   This means we can analyze the problem for white squares and black squares completely independently.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the White Edge Squares\n*   First, we count the number of white edge squares. On an 8x8 board, there are 14 white edge squares and 14 black edge squares on the perimeter.\n*   Let's examine how these white edge squares attack each other. A bishop placed on an edge square will control a diagonal that extends across the board. If this diagonal intersects another edge square of the same color, then we cannot place bishops on both squares.\n*   Let's list the pairs of white edge squares that lie on the same diagonal:\n    *   b1 and h7\n    *   d1 and h5\n    *   f1 and h3\n    *   h1 and a8\n    *   a2 and g8\n    *   a4 and e8\n    *   a6 and c8\n*   These are 7 pairs of squares. Each pair consists of two white edge squares that attack each other. In total, these 7 pairs account for all 14 white edge squares.\n*   To place the maximum number of non-attacking bishops, we can only place one bishop within each pair. For example, we could place a bishop on b1, but not on h7.\n*   Therefore, the maximum number of bishops we can place on the 14 white edge squares is 7.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the Black Edge Squares\n*   The logic is identical for the black squares. There are 14 black edge squares.\n*   Due to the symmetry of the board, these 14 squares also form 7 pairs of squares that attack each other along diagonals.\n*   The pairs of black edge squares on the same diagonal are:\n    *   a1 and h8\n    *   c1 and h6\n    *   e1 and h4\n    *   g1 and h2\n    *   a3 and f8\n    *   a5 and d8\n    *   a7 and b8\n*   Just as with the white squares, we can only place one bishop from each pair to satisfy the non-attacking condition.\n*   Therefore, the maximum number of bishops we can place on the 14 black edge squares is 7.\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the Final Answer\n*   The goal is to place as many bishops as possible on all edge squares.\n*   Maximum bishops on white edge squares = 7.\n*   Maximum bishops on black edge squares = 7.\n*   Total maximum bishops that can be placed on edge squares = 7 + 7 = 14.\n*   The question asks how many edge squares would *lack* bishops.\n*   Total number of edge squares = 28.\n*   Number of placed bishops = 14.\n*   Number of edge squares lacking bishops = (Total Edge Squares) - (Number of Placed Bishops)\n*   Number of edge squares lacking bishops = 28 - 14 = 14.\n\n<<<14>>>"
