    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the memory usage of the most memory-efficient C program solution.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Problem and Constraints\n\n*   **Input:** A string representing a sum of numbers, containing only digits '1', '2', '3', '4' and the '+' symbol. The string length is at most 1000 characters. Example: `3+2+1+4`.\n*   **Output:** The same sum, but with the numbers sorted in non-decreasing order. Example: `1+2+3+4`.\n*   **Primary Constraint:** The solution must be the \"most memory-efficient C program\". This means we should minimize the amount of memory allocated for variables.\n\n### Step 2: Evaluate Potential Solution Strategies\n\n1.  **High-Memory Approach:** Read the entire input string into a large character buffer. Then, parse the numbers from this string and store them in a separate integer array. Sort this integer array. Finally, construct a new output string from the sorted integer array. This approach is memory-intensive as it requires at least two arrays: one for the input string (up to 1001 bytes) and one for the numbers (up to 500 integers, so `500 * 4 = 2000` bytes).\n\n2.  **Medium-Memory Approach:** Read the input string into a character buffer (up to 1001 bytes). Then, perform an \"in-place\" sort of the numbers within this buffer, only modifying the character positions where digits appear. This avoids the need for a second large array. A counting sort is ideal here, which would require the buffer and a small, constant-size array for counts. This is much better but still uses over 1000 bytes for the buffer.\n\n3.  **Most Memory-Efficient (Streaming) Approach:** This strategy avoids storing the entire input string, which is the largest potential memory consumer. We can read the input one character at a time.\n    *   As we read each character, if it's a digit ('1', '2', '3', or '4'), we increment a corresponding counter. We simply ignore the '+' characters.\n    *   After the entire input has been read, we have the counts of each number. We can then directly print the final sorted sum based on these counts.\n    *   This approach only requires memory for a few counter variables, which is constant and does not depend on the input string length. This is the most memory-efficient solution.\n\n### Step 3: Design the Most Memory-Efficient Program and Identify Variables\n\nWe will use the streaming approach (Strategy 3). The program logic is as follows:\n1.  Initialize counters for numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 to zero. An array is suitable for this.\n2.  Read the input character by character in a loop until the end of the line.\n3.  Inside the loop, if the character is a digit, increment the appropriate counter.\n4.  After the loop, print the result. To handle the '+' signs correctly, a flag can be used to check if the number being printed is the first one.\n5.  Iterate from 1 to 4. For each number, print it as many times as its counter indicates. Before printing any number (except the very first one), print a '+' character.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate Total Memory Used for Variables\n\nLet's list every variable needed for this C program and calculate its size. We assume a standard environment where `sizeof(int)` is 4 bytes.\n\n1.  **Counters Array:** To store the counts of numbers '1', '2', '3', and '4'.\n    *   Variable: `int counts[4];`\n    *   Memory: `4 * sizeof(int)` = `4 * 4` = **16 bytes**.\n\n2.  **Character Input Variable:** To store the result of `getchar()`, which reads one character. `getchar()` returns an `int` to handle the special `EOF` (End-Of-File) value.\n    *   Variable: `int ch;`\n    *   Memory: `1 * sizeof(int)` = **4 bytes**.\n\n3.  **Printing Logic Flag:** A flag to ensure '+' is printed correctly between numbers, but not before the first one.\n    *   Variable: `int is_first;`\n    *   Memory: `1 * sizeof(int)` = **4 bytes**.\n\n4.  **Outer Loop Counter:** For the loop that iterates through the numbers 1 to 4 during the printing phase.\n    *   Variable: `int i;`\n    *   Memory: `1 * sizeof(int)` = **4 bytes**.\n\n5.  **Inner Loop Counter:** For the loop that prints a specific number `count` times.\n    *   Variable: `int j;`\n    *   Memory: `1 * sizeof(int)` = **4 bytes**.\n\n### Step 5: Final Answer Calculation\n\nThe total memory `m` is the sum of the memory used by all declared variables.\n\n`m = memory(counts) + memory(ch) + memory(is_first) + memory(i) + memory(j)`\n`m = 16 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4`\n`m = 32`\n\nThe most memory-efficient C program for this problem would use a total of 32 bytes for its variables.\n\n<<<32>>>"
