    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the volume of the intersection of the two cubes.\n\n**Step 1: Define the initial position of the first cube.**\nLet's place the first cube, Cube A, in a standard position in a 3D Cartesian coordinate system. The most convenient placement is with one corner at the origin (0,0,0) and the cube extending into the first octant.\n*   The vertices of Cube A are at coordinates (x, y, z) where x, y, and z can be either 0 or 1.\n*   The region occupied by Cube A is defined by the inequalities:\n    *   0 ≤ x ≤ 1\n    *   0 ≤ y ≤ 1\n    *   0 ≤ z ≤ 1\n*   The side length of Cube A is 1, and its volume is 1³ = 1.\n\n**Step 2: Interpret the shift.**\nThe second cube, Cube B, is identical to Cube A but is shifted relative to it. The shift is described as \"by 1/2 along the main diagonal\".\n*   **Identify the main diagonal:** For Cube A in our chosen position, the main diagonal connects the vertex at the origin (0,0,0) to the opposite vertex at (1,1,1).\n*   **Represent the main diagonal as a vector:** The vector representing this main diagonal is **D** = (1-0, 1-0, 1-0) = (1, 1, 1).\n*   **Determine the shift vector:** The phrase \"shifted by 1/2 along the main diagonal\" is best interpreted as a shift vector, **s**, that is equal to 1/2 of the main diagonal vector **D**.\n    *   **s** = (1/2) * **D** = (1/2) * (1, 1, 1) = (1/2, 1/2, 1/2).\n*   **Careful Point:** An alternative interpretation could be a shift of *distance* 1/2 in the direction of the main diagonal. This would result in a shift vector of **s'** = (1/2) * (**D** / |**D**|) = (1/(2√3), 1/(2√3), 1/(2√3)). This interpretation leads to irrational coordinates and a much more complex calculation. The first interpretation, where one cube's corner is moved to the other cube's center, is more common for such geometry problems and leads to a much cleaner solution.\n\n**Step 3: Define the position of the second cube.**\nCube B is the result of shifting Cube A by the vector **s** = (1/2, 1/2, 1/2). A point (x, y, z) is in Cube B if the pre-shifted point (x-1/2, y-1/2, z-1/2) was in Cube A.\n*   The region occupied by Cube B is defined by applying the shift to the inequalities of Cube A:\n    *   0 ≤ x - 1/2 ≤ 1  =>  1/2 ≤ x ≤ 3/2\n    *   0 ≤ y - 1/2 ≤ 1  =>  1/2 ≤ y ≤ 3/2\n    *   0 ≤ z - 1/2 ≤ 1  =>  1/2 ≤ z ≤ 3/2\n\n**Step 4: Find the region of intersection.**\nThe volume of the intersection is the volume of the region where a point (x, y, z) satisfies the inequalities for both Cube A and Cube B. We find the intersection of the coordinate ranges.\n*   **For the x-coordinate:** The point must be in [0, 1] AND [1/2, 3/2]. The intersection of these intervals is [1/2, 1].\n*   **For the y-coordinate:** The point must be in [0, 1] AND [1/2, 3/2]. The intersection of these intervals is [1/2, 1].\n*   **For the z-coordinate:** The point must be in [0, 1] AND [1/2, 3/2]. The intersection of these intervals is [1/2, 1].\n\nThe resulting intersection is a new rectangular prism (in fact, a cube) defined by:\n1/2 ≤ x ≤ 1\n1/2 ≤ y ≤ 1\n1/2 ≤ z ≤ 1\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the volume of the intersection.**\nThe shape of the intersection is a cube. We can calculate its side lengths from the coordinate ranges.\n*   Side length in x-direction = 1 - 1/2 = 1/2.\n*   Side length in y-direction = 1 - 1/2 = 1/2.\n*   Side length in z-direction = 1 - 1/2 = 1/2.\n\nThe volume of this intersection cube is the product of its side lengths:\nVolume = (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/8.\n\n<<<1/8>>>"
