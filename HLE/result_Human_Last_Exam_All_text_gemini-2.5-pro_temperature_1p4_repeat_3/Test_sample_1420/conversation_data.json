    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the scaling exponent $\\alpha$ for the specific heat.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Theoretical Framework**\nThe problem asks for the specific heat exponent, $\\alpha$, within the framework of the Renormalization Group (RG) theory, using the epsilon ($\\epsilon$) expansion. The specific heat $C_V$ is expected to diverge near the critical temperature $T_c$ as $C_V \\sim |T - T_c|^{-\\alpha}$. The $\\epsilon$-expansion is a perturbative method used to calculate critical exponents near the upper critical dimension, $d_c$.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Upper Critical Dimension ($d_c$) and Define $\\epsilon$**\nFor a wide range of systems described by the Ginzburg-Landau-Wilson $\\phi^4$ theory (which includes the Ising, XY, and Heisenberg models), the upper critical dimension is $d_c = 4$. Above this dimension, the predictions of mean-field theory become exact.\nThe $\\epsilon$-expansion performs calculations in $d = d_c - \\epsilon$ dimensions and treats $\\epsilon$ as a small parameter. The results are expressed as a power series in $\\epsilon$. For the given spatial dimension $d=3$, we have:\n$\\epsilon = d_c - d = 4 - 3 = 1$.\n\n**Step 3: Use the Hyperscaling Relation**\nIn RG theory, the critical exponents are not all independent. They are connected by scaling relations. The hyperscaling relation involving the specific heat exponent $\\alpha$ and the correlation length exponent $\\nu$ is:\n$2 - \\alpha = d\\nu$\nRearranging for $\\alpha$, and substituting $d = 4 - \\epsilon$, we get:\n$\\alpha = 2 - d\\nu = 2 - (4 - \\epsilon)\\nu$\nTo find $\\alpha$, we first need to find the expression for $\\nu$ in the $\\epsilon$-expansion.\n\n**Step 4: Find the Correlation Length Exponent $\\nu$**\nThe calculation of $\\nu$ to the first order in $\\epsilon$ for a general $O(n)$-symmetric model (where $n$ is the number of components of the order parameter) is a standard result in RG theory. The result is:\n$\\nu = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{n+2}{4(n+8)}\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2)$\nHere, $O(\\epsilon^2)$ denotes terms of second order or higher in $\\epsilon$.\n\n**Step 5: Derive the Expression for $\\alpha$ to First Order in $\\epsilon$**\nNow, substitute the expression for $\\nu$ into the equation for $\\alpha$ from Step 3:\n$\\alpha = 2 - (4 - \\epsilon) \\left[ \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{n+2}{4(n+8)}\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2) \\right]$\nWe expand this expression and keep only terms up to the first order in $\\epsilon$:\n$\\alpha = 2 - \\left[ (4 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}) + (4 \\cdot \\frac{n+2}{4(n+8)}\\epsilon) - (\\epsilon \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}) \\right] + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n$\\alpha = 2 - \\left[ 2 + \\frac{n+2}{n+8}\\epsilon - \\frac{1}{2}\\epsilon \\right] + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n$\\alpha = - \\left( \\frac{n+2}{n+8} - \\frac{1}{2} \\right)\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2)$\nCombining the terms in the parenthesis:\n$\\alpha = - \\left( \\frac{2(n+2) - (n+8)}{2(n+8)} \\right)\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n$\\alpha = - \\left( \\frac{2n + 4 - n - 8}{2(n+8)} \\right)\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n$\\alpha = - \\left( \\frac{n - 4}{2(n+8)} \\right)\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n$\\alpha = \\frac{4-n}{2(n+8)}\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n\n**Step 6: Specify the Model (Choose $n$) and Calculate $\\alpha$**\nThe question refers to \"a system\" without specifying the model. In such cases, it is standard practice to consider the simplest and most fundamental case, which is the Ising universality class. The Ising model has a scalar order parameter, which corresponds to $n=1$.\nNow we can calculate the value of $\\alpha$ by substituting $n=1$ and $\\epsilon=1$ into our derived formula:\n$\\alpha = \\frac{4-1}{2(1+8)} \\cdot (1) = \\frac{3}{2(9)} = \\frac{3}{18}$\n$\\alpha = \\frac{1}{6}$\n\n### Careful Points\n1.  **Model Assumption:** The calculation depends on the number of order parameter components, $n$. We assumed the Ising model ($n=1$), which is the standard baseline case in statistical mechanics.\n2.  **Order of Expansion:** The calculation is performed to the first non-vanishing order in $\\epsilon$. This is a standard procedure, but it's an approximation. Higher-order terms in the $\\epsilon$-expansion would provide a more accurate result (the accepted value for the 3D Ising model is $\\alpha \\approx 0.110$, while our result is $1/6 \\approx 0.167$).\n3.  **Validity of $\\epsilon=1$**: The $\\epsilon$-expansion is formally derived for $\\epsilon \\ll 1$. Setting $\\epsilon=1$ is a significant extrapolation. Despite this, the expansion often gives qualitatively correct and reasonably good quantitative estimates for exponents in $d=3$.\n4.  **Scaling Relations:** The use of the hyperscaling relation $2-\\alpha = d\\nu$ is crucial and is valid for dimensions $d \\le d_c$.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nThe specific heat exponent $\\alpha$ is calculated using the $\\epsilon$-expansion around the upper critical dimension $d_c=4$. For a spatial dimension $d=3$, we set $\\epsilon = 4 - 3 = 1$. The exponent $\\alpha$ is related to the correlation length exponent $\\nu$ via the hyperscaling relation $\\alpha = 2 - d\\nu$.\n\nTo first order in $\\epsilon$, the exponent $\\nu$ for the $O(n)$ model is given by:\n$\\nu = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{n+2}{4(n+8)}\\epsilon$\n\nSubstituting this into the hyperscaling relation gives:\n$\\alpha = 2 - (4-\\epsilon)\\left(\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{n+2}{4(n+8)}\\epsilon\\right) \\approx \\frac{4-n}{2(n+8)}\\epsilon$\n\nAssuming the Ising universality class ($n=1$) and setting $\\epsilon=1$:\n$\\alpha = \\frac{4-1}{2(1+8)} = \\frac{3}{18} = \\frac{1}{6}$\n\n<<<1/6>>>"
