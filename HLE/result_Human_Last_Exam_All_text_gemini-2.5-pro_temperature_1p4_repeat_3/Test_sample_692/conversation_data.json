    "This is an excellent question that requires careful distinction between different types of evidence and calendar systems used by pre-Columbian civilizations. Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Key Elements of the Question\n\n*   **\"Earliest known date\"**: We are looking for a specific point in time (e.g., a year, month, and day) that has been identified.\n*   **\"Recorded\"**: The date must be physically inscribed or painted by the ancient civilization itself.\n*   **\"pre-Columbian civilization in the Americas\"**: The civilization must have existed before 1492 in North, Central, or South America. The most relevant cultures for this question are in Mesoamerica (modern-day Mexico and Central America).\n*   **\"Aboriginal writing system\"**: The date must be written in a native script (like Maya hieroglyphs or Zapotec script) and utilize a native calendar system.\n\n### Step 2: Identifying Relevant Calendar Systems\n\nThe key to answering this question lies in the **Mesoamerican Long Count calendar**. Unlike other calendars which were cyclical (like the 260-day sacred calendar or the 365-day solar calendar), the Long Count was linear. It counted the number of days that had passed since a mythological starting point, equivalent to August 11, 3114 BC in the Gregorian calendar. This system allows for the precise dating of events over thousands of years. Dates recorded in the Long Count are the best candidates for the \"earliest known recorded date.\"\n\n### Step 3: Examining the Contenders\n\nSeveral artifacts have been discovered with very early dates. Let's analyze the most important ones in chronological order of their discovery or initial dating.\n\n1.  **Tres Zapotes Stela C**: Found in the Olmec heartland of Veracruz, Mexico, this monument was for a long time considered the record holder. It is associated with the Epi-Olmec culture that succeeded the Olmecs. It is inscribed with a Long Count date of **7.16.6.16.18**, which correlates to **September 3, 32 BC**.\n\n2.  **San José Mogote Monument 3**: This Zapotec monument from Oaxaca, Mexico, is archaeologically much older, dating to around **600 BC**. It depicts a sacrificed captive with a glyph between his legs corresponding to his name in the 260-day calendar: \"1 Earthquake.\"\n    *   **Careful Point**: While this is a very early example of writing and calendrics, it is a calendrical *name* from a repeating 260-day cycle. It does not pinpoint a specific year in a linear count. Therefore, it is the earliest evidence of a *calendar system* in use, but not the earliest *recorded absolute date*.\n\n3.  **Chiapa de Corzo Stela 2**: Discovered in Chiapas, Mexico, this stela fragment contains a date that is now recognized as the earliest known Long Count date. The inscription records the date as **7.16.3.2.13**.\n    *   **Analysis**: Comparing this to Tres Zapotes Stela C:\n        *   Chiapa de Corzo: **7.16.3**.2.13\n        *   Tres Zapotes: **7.16.6**.16.18\n    *   Because the third number (the *Tun*, or 360-day period) is smaller for the Chiapa de Corzo stela (3 vs. 6), its date is earlier.\n\n### Step 4: Converting the Earliest Date to Our Calendar\n\nThe Long Count date on Chiapa de Corzo Stela 2, **7.16.3.2.13**, needs to be converted to the Gregorian calendar for our understanding. Using the standard GMT (Goodman-Martínez-Thompson) correlation, this date corresponds to a day in **December of 36 BC**. The specific day is calculated to be around December 7th or 8th, but the year is the most crucial component.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on current archaeological evidence, the earliest securely deciphered absolute date recorded in a native writing system comes from **Chiapa de Corzo Stela 2**. While there is older evidence of writing (the Cascajal Block, c. 900 BC) and older evidence of calendrical glyphs (San José Mogote Monument 3, c. 600 BC), the Chiapa de Corzo stela holds the record for the earliest inscribed date within the linear Long Count calendar, providing a precise point in history.\n\nThe date recorded is **December of 36 BC**.\n\n<<<December 36 BC>>>"
