    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the statement.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Define SNP Heritability (h²_snp):**\n    *   SNP heritability is a population parameter. It represents the proportion of the total variation in a phenotype (e.g., height, disease risk) that can be explained by the additive effects of all the Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) considered, typically all common SNPs across the genome.\n    *   Crucially, it represents the **theoretical upper limit** or the ceiling of predictability for that phenotype using a linear model of those specific SNPs. It assumes you know the **true** causal effect size of every SNP.\n\n2.  **Define a Polygenic Score (PGS):**\n    *   A polygenic score is a practical tool used to predict an individual's phenotype. It is a single value calculated for an individual based on their genotype.\n    *   It is constructed as a weighted sum of the individual's risk alleles across many SNPs.\n    *   The weights used in this sum are the **estimated** effect sizes for each SNP, which are derived from a large-scale genetic study, typically a Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS).\n\n3.  **Define the Predictive Ability of a PGS:**\n    *   The predictive ability of a PGS is measured by how much of the variance in the phenotype it can explain in a **new, independent dataset** (one not used to create the score). This is typically quantified by the coefficient of determination, R².\n    *   This R² value tells us how well our constructed score predicts the actual phenotype in the real world.\n\n4.  **Compare SNP Heritability and PGS Predictive Ability:**\n    *   The core difference lies in the effect sizes (weights) used. SNP heritability (h²_snp) is a theoretical concept based on **true, unknown** effect sizes. A PGS is a practical predictor based on **estimated** effect sizes from a GWAS.\n    *   Because a GWAS is conducted on a finite sample of people, the effect sizes it estimates will always have some degree of statistical noise or \"estimation error.\" They are not the true, perfect values.\n    *   When these imperfect, noisy estimates are used to build a PGS, the score's predictive ability will be degraded compared to a hypothetical \"perfect\" score built with the true effect sizes.\n    *   Therefore, the variance explained by a real-world PGS (its R²) will be lower than the total variance that is theoretically explainable by all the SNPs (the h²_snp).\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **\"Necessarily\":** This word is key. The relationship isn't just a common occurrence; it's a statistical necessity. The predictive accuracy of a model built with estimated parameters (the PGS) cannot exceed the theoretical maximum accuracy of a model with the true parameters (which defines h²_snp). The only way they could be equal is if the effect sizes were estimated with zero error, which would require a GWAS with an infinite sample size—a practical impossibility.\n*   **Source of the Gap:** The gap between PGS R² and h²_snp is primarily due to the finite sample size of the GWAS used to estimate the weights. Other factors like imperfect modeling of Linkage Disequilibrium (LD) and differences in genetic ancestry between the GWAS and prediction samples also contribute to lowering the R² further below the h²_snp ceiling.\n*   **Analogy:** Imagine trying to predict the weather. SNP heritability is like the absolute physical limit of predictability given all current atmospheric data. A PGS is like an actual weather forecast model built by meteorologists. Because their model has imperfections and is based on incomplete historical data, their forecast will never be as accurate as the theoretical physical limit of predictability.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe predictive ability of a polygenic score (measured by R²) is fundamentally limited by the SNP heritability (h²_snp). Since the PGS is constructed using estimated and therefore imperfect weights from a finite sample, its predictive power will inevitably be less than the theoretical maximum represented by the SNP heritability. Thus, the statement is correct.\n\n**True**\n\n<<<True>>>"
