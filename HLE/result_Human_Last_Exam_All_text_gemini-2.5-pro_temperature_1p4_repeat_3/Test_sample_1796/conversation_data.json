    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the sentence:** The sentence provided is \"Fat people eat accumulates.\"\n2.  **Identify the word in question:** The question asks for the part of speech of the first word, which is \"Fat\".\n3.  **Analyze the function of the word \"Fat\" in the sentence:**\n    *   The word \"Fat\" appears directly before the word \"people\".\n    *   The word \"people\" is a noun, as it refers to a group of persons.\n    *   The word \"Fat\" is used here to describe or modify the noun \"people\". It answers the question \"What kind of people?\".\n4.  **Define the relevant parts of speech:**\n    *   An **adjective** is a word that modifies (describes) a noun or a pronoun.\n    *   A **noun** is a word for a person, place, thing, or idea.\n    *   A **verb** is a word that expresses action or a state of being.\n5.  **Apply the definition to the word in context:** Since \"Fat\" is describing the noun \"people\", its grammatical function in this sentence is that of an adjective.\n\n**Careful points:**\n\n*   **Grammatical correctness:** The overall sentence \"Fat people eat accumulates\" is grammatically incorrect. A correct sentence might be \"What fat people eat accumulates\" or \"The food fat people eat accumulates\". However, the question asks about the part of speech of a word within the *given* sentence, not a corrected one. We must analyze its function as presented.\n*   **Multiple meanings of a word:** The word \"fat\" can also be a noun (e.g., \"The body stores fat.\"). But in this specific phrase, \"Fat people\", its role is clearly to describe the people. Therefore, we must rely on the context provided.\n*   **Context is key:** The position of \"Fat\" right before the noun \"people\" is the primary clue to its function as an adjective.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis, the word \"Fat\" functions as an adjective in this sentence because it modifies the noun \"people\".\n\n<<<C>>>"
