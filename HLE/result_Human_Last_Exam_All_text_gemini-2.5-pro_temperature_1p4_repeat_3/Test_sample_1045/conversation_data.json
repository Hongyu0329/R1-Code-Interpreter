    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of contracted Gaussian functions for toluene (C7H8) using the 6-31G basis set.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Identify the molecular formula and atom count.**\nThe molecule is toluene, with the chemical formula C7H8.\n*   Number of Carbon (C) atoms = 7\n*   Number of Hydrogen (H) atoms = 8\n\n**Step 2: Understand the 6-31G basis set notation.**\nThe 6-31G basis set is a type of Pople basis set. The notation describes how atomic orbitals are represented by contracted Gaussian functions (CGFs). A CGF is a fixed linear combination of primitive Gaussian functions (PGFs). The question asks for the number of CGFs, also known as basis functions.\n\n*   The number before the hyphen (**6**) describes the core atomic orbitals. It means that each core orbital is represented by a single CGF, which is formed by contracting 6 PGFs.\n*   The numbers after the hyphen (**31**) describe the valence atomic orbitals. This is a \"split-valence\" basis set, meaning the valence shell is represented by more than one CGF per atomic orbital. The \"31\" indicates the valence shell is split into two parts (a \"double-zeta\" description):\n    *   An \"inner\" valence part, where each orbital is represented by one CGF contracted from **3** PGFs.\n    *   An \"outer\" valence part, where each orbital is represented by one CGF contracted from **1** PGF.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the number of contracted Gaussian functions (CGFs) for a single Carbon atom.**\nA Carbon atom (atomic number 6) has electron configuration 1s² 2s² 2p².\n*   **Core Orbital (1s):** The \"6\" in 6-31G describes this orbital. It is represented by **1 CGF**.\n*   **Valence Orbitals (2s and 2p):** The \"31\" describes these orbitals. The valence shell for Carbon consists of one 2s orbital and three 2p orbitals (2px, 2py, 2pz).\n    *   **Inner Valence (\"3\"):** This part provides one CGF for the 2s orbital and one CGF for each of the three 2p orbitals. This gives 1 (s-type) + 3 (p-type) = **4 CGFs**.\n    *   **Outer Valence (\"1\"):** This part provides a second, more diffuse set of functions. It adds another CGF for the 2s orbital and another CGF for each of the three 2p orbitals. This gives another 1 (s-type) + 3 (p-type) = **4 CGFs**.\n*   **Total for one Carbon atom:** 1 (core) + 4 (inner valence) + 4 (outer valence) = **9 CGFs**.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the number of CGFs for a single Hydrogen atom.**\nA Hydrogen atom (atomic number 1) has electron configuration 1s¹. It has no core electrons.\n*   **Valence Orbital (1s):** The entire \"31\" description applies to the 1s valence orbital.\n    *   **Inner Valence (\"3\"):** This provides one CGF for the 1s orbital. This is **1 CGF**.\n    *   **Outer Valence (\"1\"):** This provides a second CGF for the 1s orbital. This is **1 CGF**.\n*   **Total for one Hydrogen atom:** 1 (inner) + 1 (outer) = **2 CGFs**.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the total number of CGFs for the toluene molecule (C7H8).**\nNow, we combine the results from the previous steps with the atom counts from Step 1.\n*   Total CGFs from Carbon: 7 C atoms × 9 CGFs/C atom = 63 CGFs\n*   Total CGFs from Hydrogen: 8 H atoms × 2 CGFs/H atom = 16 CGFs\n*   **Total for Toluene:** 63 + 16 = **79 CGFs**\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n1.  **Atom Count:** Ensure the correct number of each atom in the molecule is used (7 Carbons, 8 Hydrogens for toluene).\n2.  **Basis Set Interpretation:** Correctly interpret the \"core-valence\" split. The number before the hyphen is for core orbitals, and the numbers after are for valence orbitals.\n3.  **Valence Shell Composition:** Remember that for second-period elements like Carbon, the valence shell includes both s and p orbitals. The split description applies to all of them.\n4.  **Hydrogen Exception:** Recognize that Hydrogen has no core electrons, so the notation after the hyphen applies directly to its 1s valence orbital.\n5.  **Contracted vs. Primitive Functions:** The question asks for *contracted* Gaussian functions (the basis functions used in the calculation), not the total number of *primitive* Gaussians they are built from.\n\n<<<79>>>"
