    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the continued fraction associated with the generalized Markov number \\( m_{4/7} \\).\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Compute the continued fraction of the rational number 4/7.**\n\nTo find the continued fraction of \\( 4/7 \\), we use the Euclidean algorithm.\n1.  The integer part of \\( 4/7 \\) is 0. We take the reciprocal of the fractional part:\n    \\[ \\frac{1}{4/7} = \\frac{7}{4} \\]\n2.  The integer part of \\( 7/4 \\) is 1. We subtract the integer part and take the reciprocal of the remainder:\n    \\[ \\frac{7}{4} - 1 = \\frac{3}{4} \\quad \\rightarrow \\quad \\frac{1}{3/4} = \\frac{4}{3} \\]\n3.  The integer part of \\( 4/3 \\) is 1. We subtract the integer part and take the reciprocal of the remainder:\n    \\[ \\frac{4}{3} - 1 = \\frac{1}{3} \\quad \\rightarrow \\quad \\frac{1}{1/3} = 3 \\]\n4.  The integer part of 3 is 3. Since the remainder is 0, the process terminates.\n\nThe coefficients of the continued fraction are the integer parts we found: 1, 1, 3.\nSo, the continued fraction of \\( 4/7 \\) is:\n\\[ \\frac{4}{7} = [0; 1, 1, 3] \\]\nLet's denote the coefficients as \\( a_1=1, a_2=1, a_3=3 \\).\n\n**Step 2: Understand the association between a rational number and a continued fraction in the context of generalized Markov numbers.**\n\nThe theory of Markov numbers is deeply connected to the geometry of the modular surface and Diophantine approximation. To each rational number \\( p/q \\), one can associate a special quadratic irrationality whose properties generalize those associated with the classical Markov numbers.\n\nA standard and geometrically meaningful method for this association is to construct a purely periodic continued fraction whose period is a palindrome formed from the coefficients of the continued fraction of \\( p/q \\). This quadratic irrationality corresponds to a closed geodesic on the modular surface, which is a generalization of the special geodesics tied to the classical Markov numbers.\n\n**Step 3: Construct the palindromic period.**\n\nLet the continued fraction of the rational number be \\( [0; a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n] \\). The period of the associated quadratic irrationality is formed by creating a palindrome from this sequence of coefficients. The period is \\( (a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n, a_n, \\dots, a_2, a_1) \\).\n\nFor \\( 4/7 = [0; 1, 1, 3] \\), we have \\( (a_1, a_2, a_3) = (1, 1, 3) \\).\nThe corresponding palindromic sequence is \\( (a_1, a_2, a_3, a_3, a_2, a_1) \\).\nSubstituting the values, we get the sequence:\n\\[ (1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1) \\]\n\n**Step 4: Write the final continued fraction.**\n\nThe continued fraction associated with the generalized Markov number \\( m_{4/7} \\) is the purely periodic continued fraction with the palindromic period we constructed in the previous step.\n\nTherefore, the associated continued fraction is:\n\\[ [\\overline{1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1}] \\]\n\n### Careful Points:\n*   **Correctness of the initial C.F.:** The entire result depends on the correct continued fraction of \\( 4/7 \\). It is crucial to compute this accurately. A check is always a good idea: \\( [0; 1, 1, 3] = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{1}{3}}} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{1}{4/3}} = \\frac{1}{1 + 3/4} = \\frac{1}{7/4} = 4/7 \\). The calculation is correct.\n*   **Ambiguity of \"associated with\":** The term \"generalized Markov number\" and the \"associated continued fraction\" can have different meanings in different mathematical contexts. The chosen construction (forming a palindromic period) is prominent in the geometric theory of continued fractions and its connection to the modular group, which is a modern viewpoint on Markov's theory. It provides a canonical way to associate a quadratic irrationality (and its C.F.) to any rational number.\n*   **Final Form:** The question asks for the continued fraction itself, not its numerical value. The standard notation for a repeating continued fraction should be used.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\n1.  Calculate the continued fraction of the rational number: \\( \\frac{4}{7} = [0; 1, 1, 3] \\). The coefficients are \\( (a_1, a_2, a_3) = (1, 1, 3) \\).\n2.  Form a palindromic periodic block using these coefficients: \\( (a_1, a_2, a_3, a_3, a_2, a_1) = (1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1) \\).\n3.  Construct the purely periodic continued fraction with this block. The result is \\( [\\overline{1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1}] \\)."
