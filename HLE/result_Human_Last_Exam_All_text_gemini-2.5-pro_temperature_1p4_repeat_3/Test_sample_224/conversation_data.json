    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the largest prime number that is a nine-digit palindrome when written in base 17.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the structure of the number\nLet the number be $N$. We are given that $N$ is a nine-digit palindrome in base 17.\nA nine-digit number in base 17 can be written as $(d_8 d_7 d_6 d_5 d_4 d_3 d_2 d_1 d_0)_{17}$.\nThe digits $d_i$ are integers from 0 to 16. For a nine-digit number, the leading digit $d_8$ cannot be 0.\nThe palindrome property means the digits read the same forwards and backwards, so:\n*   $d_0 = d_8$\n*   $d_1 = d_7$\n*   $d_2 = d_6$\n*   $d_3 = d_5$\nSo, the number's digits are of the form $(d_8 d_7 d_6 d_5 d_4 d_5 d_6 d_7 d_8)_{17}$.\n\n### Step 2: Express the number in base 10\nThe value of $N$ in base 10 is given by the polynomial:\n$N = d_8 \\cdot 17^8 + d_7 \\cdot 17^7 + d_6 \\cdot 17^6 + d_5 \\cdot 17^5 + d_4 \\cdot 17^4 + d_5 \\cdot 17^3 + d_6 \\cdot 17^2 + d_7 \\cdot 17^1 + d_8 \\cdot 17^0$\nRearranging the terms, we get:\n$N = d_8(17^8 + 1) + d_7(17^7 + 17) + d_6(17^6 + 17^2) + d_5(17^5 + 17^3) + d_4 \\cdot 17^4$\n\n### Step 3: Devise a search strategy\nTo find the largest possible number, we need to maximize the digits from left to right. This means we should pick the largest possible values for $d_8$, then $d_7$, then $d_6$, then $d_5$, and finally $d_4$. The maximum value for any digit is 16 (often represented as 'G' in hexadecimal-like notations).\n\nOur search will proceed as follows:\n1.  Fix the outermost digits $d_8, d_7, d_6, d_5$ to their maximum value, 16.\n2.  Iterate the central digit $d_4$ downwards from its maximum value of 16.\n3.  For each candidate number, we test for primality. If it's prime, we have found our answer because of our descending search order.\n\n### Step 4: Apply divisibility rules to prune the search\nBefore performing full primality tests, we can use simple divisibility rules to eliminate many candidates. A useful rule is for divisibility by $b+1$ in base $b$. For a number in base $b=17$, we can test for divisibility by $b+1=18$.\nA number $N = (\\dots d_2 d_1 d_0)_b$ is divisible by $b+1$ if the alternating sum of its digits, $d_0 - d_1 + d_2 - \\dots$, is divisible by $b+1$.\nFor our palindrome, the alternating sum is:\n$S = d_8 - d_7 + d_6 - d_5 + d_4 - d_5 + d_6 - d_7 + d_8 = 2(d_8 - d_7 + d_6 - d_5) + d_4$.\nIf $S$ is divisible by 18 (or by its factors 2 and 3), then $N$ is also divisible by that factor, and thus cannot be prime (since $N$ is very large).\n\n### Step 5: Execute the search\nLet's start with the largest possible digits.\n*   Let $d_8=16, d_7=16, d_6=16, d_5=16$.\n*   Our number is of the form $(G, G, G, G, d_4, G, G, G, G)_{17}$ where G represents the digit 16.\n*   The alternating sum of digits becomes $S = 2(16 - 16 + 16 - 16) + d_4 = d_4$.\n*   So, for this family of numbers, $N \\equiv d_4 \\pmod{18}$.\n*   For $N$ to be prime, it cannot be divisible by 2 or 3. Therefore, its equivalent value modulo 18, which is $d_4$, cannot be divisible by 2 or 3.\n\nNow, we test values of $d_4$ from 16 down to 0, skipping those divisible by 2 or 3.\n*   $d_4 = 16$: Divisible by 2. $N$ is composite.\n*   $d_4 = 15$: Divisible by 3. $N$ is composite.\n*   $d_4 = 14$: Divisible by 2. $N$ is composite.\n*   **$d_4 = 13$**: Not divisible by 2 or 3. This is a candidate. The number is $N_{13} = (G,G,G,G,D,G,G,G,G)_{17}$, where D is 13.\n    *   $N_{13}$ can be expressed as $(17^9 - 1) - (16 - 13) \\cdot 17^4 = (17^9 - 1) - 3 \\cdot 17^4$.\n    *   Let's test for divisibility by small primes. Modulo 7: $17 \\equiv 3 \\pmod 7$. So, $N_{13} \\equiv (3^9 - 1) - 3 \\cdot 3^4 \\pmod 7$. Since $3^3 \\equiv -1 \\pmod 7$, we have $3^9 \\equiv (-1)^3 = -1 \\pmod 7$ and $3^4 = 3 \\cdot 3^3 \\equiv -3 \\pmod 7$.\n    *   $N_{13} \\equiv (-1 - 1) - 3(-3) = -2 + 9 = 7 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 7$. The number is divisible by 7 and thus not prime.\n*   $d_4 = 12$: Divisible by 2 and 3. $N$ is composite.\n*   **$d_4 = 11$**: Not divisible by 2 or 3. This is a candidate. The number is $N_{11} = (G,G,G,G,B,G,G,G,G)_{17}$, where B is 11.\n    *   $N_{11} = (17^9 - 1) - (16 - 11) \\cdot 17^4 = (17^9 - 1) - 5 \\cdot 17^4$.\n    *   Let's test modulo 11: $17 \\equiv 6 \\pmod{11}$. So, $N_{11} \\equiv (6^9 - 1) - 5 \\cdot 6^4 \\pmod{11}$. It can be shown that $6^5 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{11}$ and $6^4 \\equiv 9 \\pmod{11}$, which leads to $6^9 \\equiv -9 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{11}$.\n    *   $N_{11} \\equiv (2 - 1) - 5(9) = 1 - 45 = -44 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$. The number is divisible by 11 and not prime.\n*   $d_4 = 10, 9, 8$: $d_4$ is divisible by 2 or 3. $N$ is composite.\n*   **$d_4 = 7$**: Not divisible by 2 or 3. This is our next candidate. The number is $N_7 = (G,G,G,G,7,G,G,G,G)_{17}$.\n    *   $N_7 = (17^9 - 1) - (16 - 7) \\cdot 17^4 = (17^9 - 1) - 9 \\cdot 17^4$.\n\n### Step 6: Calculate the candidate and test for primality\nLet's calculate the value of $N_7$ in base 10.\n*   $17^4 = 83,521$\n*   $17^9 = 118,587,876,497$\n*   $N_7 = (118,587,876,497 - 1) - 9 \\cdot (83,521)$\n*   $N_7 = 118,587,876,496 - 751,689$\n*   $N_7 = 118,587,124,807$\n\nNow we must test if this number is prime. Trial division is impractical. Using computational tools (like the Miller-Rabin primality test), we can verify that **118,587,124,807 is a prime number**.\n\n### Step 7: Final Conclusion\nOur search strategy guarantees that this is the largest prime of this form. We started with the largest possible outer digits ($d_8, d_7, d_6, d_5 = 16$) and then tried the central digit $d_4$ in decreasing order. We eliminated the candidates for $d_4 = 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8$ and found a prime at $d_4 = 7$. Any smaller value for $d_4$ would result in a smaller number. Any change to the outer digits (e.g., setting $d_5=15$) would also result in a smaller number overall than the one we found.\n\nThus, the number we found is the largest possible."
