    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of historical saints mentioned by name in Milton's *Paradise Lost*.\n\n### **Step 1: Define the Key Terms**\n\nTo answer the question accurately, we must first define what \"historical saint\" and \"mentioned by name\" mean in the context of Milton's epic.\n\n*   **Historical:** In *Paradise Lost*, Milton treats the biblical narrative as literal history. Therefore, \"historical\" refers to human figures who appear in the Old or New Testaments, as opposed to angels (Michael, Raphael), allegorical figures (Sin, Death), or pagan deities (Moloch, Belial).\n*   **Saint:** Milton was a devout Protestant, and his use of the word \"saint\" differs from the Catholic tradition of canonization. For Milton, a \"saint\" (from the Greek *hagios*, \"holy one\") is a true believer, one of the faithful, a righteous person chosen by God. This includes patriarchs, prophets, and other key holy figures from the Bible, even if they had moral failings but were ultimately part of God's redemptive plan.\n*   **Mentioned by Name:** The individual's specific name (e.g., \"Moses,\" \"David\") must appear in the text, not just be described by their role (e.g., \"the Virgin,\" \"the Baptist\").\n\n### **Step 2: Systematic Search of *Paradise Lost***\n\nWe will now search the twelve books of the poem for names that fit the criteria defined above. The most fruitful sections for this are Book III (Limbo of Vanity) and Books XI-XII (Michael's vision of future history).\n\n**Book I:**\n*   **Moses:** Mentioned twice in connection with the plagues of Egypt and the parting of the Red Sea. (Count: 1)\n*   **Aaron:** Mentioned alongside Moses. (Count: 2)\n\n**Book III:**\n*   **Abraham:** His \"bosom\" is mentioned as a destination for the righteous. (Count: 3)\n*   **Jacob:** Mentioned for his vision of the ladder to heaven. (Count: 4)\n*   **Enoch:** Named as one who was translated to Heaven. (Count: 5)\n*   **Elias (Elijah):** Mentioned alongside Enoch as one taken to Heaven. (Count: 6)\n\n**Book IV:**\n*   **Adam:** The first man and a central character. He repents and receives God's grace, making him the first \"saint\" in the redemptive story. (Count: 7)\n*   **Eve:** The first woman. Like Adam, she repents and is a \"holy foremother\" in the lineage of faith. (Count: 8)\n\n**Books V-X:**\n*   No new historical saints are mentioned by name in these books.\n\n**Book XI:**\n*   **Abel:** His murder by Cain is shown to Adam in a vision. He is the first martyr. (Count: 9)\n*   **Noah:** The righteous man who survives the Flood and becomes the father of the new world. (Count: 10)\n    *   *Note:* Enoch is mentioned again in this book but is already counted.\n\n**Book XII:**\nThis book contains Michael's narration of history from the Flood to the Second Coming.\n*   **Joseph:** Mentioned as the son of Jacob who was sold into Egypt and rose to power. (Count: 11)\n*   **Joshua:** Named as Moses' successor who will lead the Israelites into the promised land. (Count: 12)\n*   **David:** Named as the great king from whose line the Messiah will come. (Count: 13)\n*   **Jesus:** Milton explicitly uses the name \"Jesus,\" explaining its connection to \"Joshua\": \"...Joshua, whom the Gentiles Jesus call, / His name and office bearing...\" As the central figure of the faith, he is the ultimate \"holy one.\" (Count: 14)\n\n### **Step 3: Review and Finalize the List**\n\nLet's review the candidates and consider figures who are mentioned but do not qualify.\n*   **Figures who are not named:** Mary is only called \"the Virgin,\" and the Apostles are referred to collectively as \"the twelve.\" John the Baptist is alluded to but not named. Isaac is only called Abraham's \"son.\"\n*   **Figures named but not presented as \"saints\":** Cain, Nimrod, and Pharaoh are presented as evil or tyrannical. Solomon is mentioned by name, but Michael criticizes him for falling into idolatry (\"his heart... Beguil'd by fair Idolatresses, fell / To Idols foul\"), disqualifying him from Milton's view of sainthood in this context.\n\nOur final list of named historical saints is:\n1.  Moses\n2.  Aaron\n3.  Abraham\n4.  Jacob\n5.  Enoch\n6.  Elias (Elijah)\n7.  Adam\n8.  Eve\n9.  Abel\n10. Noah\n11. Joseph\n12. Joshua\n13. David\n14. Jesus\n\nThe total number is 14.\n\n<<<14>>>"
