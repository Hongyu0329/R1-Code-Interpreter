    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode with an infinite number of players.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Determine the Base Health:**\n    The first step is to find the base health of the Eye of Cthulhu. In Terraria's Normal Mode, for a single player, the Eye of Cthulhu has **2,800** health.\n\n2.  **Apply the Expert Mode Health Modifier:**\n    In Expert Mode, the health of most bosses is increased. For the Eye of Cthulhu, its health is multiplied by a factor of 1.3.\n    *   Single-player Expert Mode Health = Normal Mode Health × 1.3\n    *   Single-player Expert Mode Health = 2,800 × 1.3 = **3,640**\n\n3.  **Understand Multiplayer Health Scaling:**\n    In Expert Mode, boss health increases for each additional player in the world when the boss is summoned. The health is scaled up by 35% for each player beyond the first. The formula for the health multiplier is:\n    *   `Multiplier = 1 + (0.35 × (N - 1))`\n    *   Where `N` is the number of players.\n\n    The total health would be calculated as:\n    *   `Total Health = 3,640 × (1 + (0.35 × (N - 1)))`\n\n4.  **Evaluate for an Infinite Number of Players (Theoretically):**\n    The question asks for the health given an infinite number of players. If we take the limit of the formula as `N` approaches infinity, the multiplier `(1 + (0.35 × (N - 1)))` would also approach infinity. This would suggest that the boss's health is infinite.\n\n5.  **Identify the Health Cap:**\n    However, game developers often implement caps to prevent values from becoming absurdly high. According to Terraria's source code, for a few specific early-game bosses, including the Eye of Cthulhu, there is a hard cap on their health in multiplayer Expert Mode. This cap is set to **1,000%** of the boss's **Normal Mode base health**.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Maximum Health:**\n    The cap prevents the final health from exceeding this value, regardless of how many players are present. We can calculate this maximum value:\n    *   Maximum Health = Normal Mode Base Health × 1,000%\n    *   Maximum Health = 2,800 × 10\n    *   Maximum Health = **28,000**\n\n### Conclusion\n\nEven though the scaling formula would yield an infinite value for an infinite number of players, the game's code imposes a hard cap on the Eye of Cthulhu's health in Expert Mode. This cap is 10 times its Normal Mode base health. Therefore, the theoretical maximum health is 28,000. The cap is reached when there are 21 or more players, so any number of players beyond that (including infinite) will result in the same maximum health.\n\n<<<28000>>>"
