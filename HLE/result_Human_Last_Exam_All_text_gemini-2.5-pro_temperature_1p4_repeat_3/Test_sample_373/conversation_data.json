    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the probability of sampling the bottleneck edge in a barbell graph with 10 nodes using randomized uniform gossiping.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Graph Structure: The Barbell Graph**\n\n*   A barbell graph is constructed by connecting two identical complete graphs (cliques) with a single edge.\n*   The total number of nodes is 10. Let each complete graph (clique) be a $K_n$. The total number of nodes in the barbell graph would be $2n$.\n*   Therefore, $2n = 10$, which means $n = 5$.\n*   So, the graph consists of two $K_5$ (complete graphs with 5 nodes each) connected by a single edge. Let's call them Clique A and Clique B.\n*   **Careful Point:** It's crucial to correctly identify the structure. A 10-node barbell graph is two 5-node cliques.\n\n**2. Identify the Bottleneck Edge**\n\n*   The \"bottleneck edge\" is the single edge that connects Clique A and Clique B. Its removal would disconnect the graph.\n*   Let's label the nodes connected by this bottleneck edge as node `u` (in Clique A) and node `v` (in Clique B). The bottleneck edge is $e_b = (u, v)$.\n\n**3. Understand the Sampling Process: Randomized Uniform Gossiping**\n\n*   Randomized uniform gossiping is a two-step process for selecting an edge in each round:\n    1.  **Select a node `i` uniformly at random** from all nodes in the graph. Since there are $N=10$ nodes, the probability of picking any specific node `i` is $P(\\text{select } i) = 1/N = 1/10$.\n    2.  **Select one of its neighbors `j` uniformly at random.** The probability of selecting a specific neighbor `j`, given that node `i` was selected, is $P(\\text{select } j | \\text{select } i) = 1/d(i)$, where $d(i)$ is the degree of node `i` (the number of its neighbors).\n*   **Careful Point:** The process is not a uniform sampling of all edges. The probability of sampling an edge depends on the degrees of the nodes it connects.\n\n**4. Calculate the Degrees of the Relevant Nodes**\n\n*   We need the degrees of nodes `u` and `v` to calculate the probability.\n*   **Degree of node `u` (in Clique A):**\n    *   Node `u` is part of a $K_5$. It is connected to the other 4 nodes in Clique A.\n    *   It is also connected to node `v` in Clique B via the bottleneck edge.\n    *   Therefore, the total degree of `u` is $d(u) = 4 + 1 = 5$.\n*   **Degree of node `v` (in Clique B):**\n    *   Similarly, node `v` is connected to the other 4 nodes in Clique B.\n    *   It is also connected to node `u`.\n    *   Therefore, the total degree of `v` is $d(v) = 4 + 1 = 5$.\n*   **Careful Point:** A common mistake is to miscalculate the degrees. The nodes at the ends of the connecting \"bar\" have a higher degree than the other nodes within the cliques. (For completeness, the other 8 nodes each have a degree of 4).\n\n**5. Calculate the Probability of Sampling the Bottleneck Edge**\n\n*   The bottleneck edge $(u, v)$ is \"sampled\" if either of these two mutually exclusive events occurs:\n    1.  We select node `u` first, then its neighbor `v`.\n    2.  We select node `v` first, then its neighbor `u`.\n*   We need to calculate the probability of each event and add them together.\n\n*   **Probability of Event 1 (u → v):**\n    *   Probability of selecting node `u`: $P(\\text{select } u) = 1/10$.\n    *   Given `u` is selected, the probability of selecting neighbor `v`: $P(\\text{select } v | \\text{select } u) = 1/d(u) = 1/5$.\n    *   The combined probability is: $P(u \\to v) = (1/10) \\times (1/5) = 1/50$.\n\n*   **Probability of Event 2 (v → u):**\n    *   Probability of selecting node `v`: $P(\\text{select } v) = 1/10$.\n    *   Given `v` is selected, the probability of selecting neighbor `u`: $P(\\text{select } u | \\text{select } v) = 1/d(v) = 1/5$.\n    *   The combined probability is: $P(v \\to u) = (1/10) \\times (1/5) = 1/50$.\n\n*   **Total Probability:**\n    *   The total probability of sampling the bottleneck edge is the sum of the probabilities of these two events:\n    *   $P(\\text{sample edge } (u,v)) = P(u \\to v) + P(v \\to u) = 1/50 + 1/50 = 2/50$.\n\n**6. Final Answer**\n\n*   Simplifying the fraction gives the final probability.\n*   $P = 2/50 = 1/25$.\n*   As a decimal, this is $0.04$.\n\nThe final probability of sampling the bottleneck edge is 1/25.\n\n<<<1/25>>>"
