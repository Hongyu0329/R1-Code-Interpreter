    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction to determine the final product.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the Starting Material:**\n    The starting material is **N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide**.\n    *   The parent structure is a **benzamide**, which is a benzene ring attached to a C(=O)N group.\n    *   **N,N-diethyl** indicates two ethyl groups (-CH₂CH₃) are attached to the nitrogen atom of the amide. So, the group at position 1 is -C(=O)N(Et)₂.\n    *   **3-dimethylamino** indicates a dimethylamino group (-N(CH₃)₂) is at position 3 of the benzene ring.\n    *   The structure has hydrogens at positions 2, 4, 5, and 6 of the aromatic ring.\n\n    Structure:\n     \n\n2.  **Analyze the First Set of Reagents and Conditions:**\n    *   **sec-BuLi (sec-Butyllithium):** This is a very strong organometallic base. It is commonly used to deprotonate C-H bonds that are not very acidic, such as those on an aromatic ring.\n    *   **TMEDA (Tetramethylethylenediamine):** This is a chelating ligand for the lithium ion (Li⁺). It breaks up the aggregates of sec-BuLi, making it more reactive (a \"superbase\"). It also coordinates with the lithium atom of the product, stabilizing the intermediate.\n    *   **THF (Tetrahydrofuran):** This is the aprotic polar solvent for the reaction.\n    *   **Reaction Type:** The combination of a strong base like sec-BuLi with an aromatic compound containing a suitable functional group points towards a **Directed Ortho Metalation (DoM)** reaction. In this reaction, a substituent directs the base to deprotonate a proton at a position *ortho* (adjacent) to it.\n\n3.  **Determine the Site of Lithiation (Deprotonation):**\n    *   We must identify the directing groups on the benzene ring. Both the amide group, -C(=O)N(Et)₂, and the dimethylamino group, -N(CH₃)₂, are effective directing groups.\n    *   The directing ability of a group is related to its ability to coordinate with the lithium ion. The oxygen of the amide's carbonyl group and the nitrogen of the dimethylamino group can both act as Lewis bases to coordinate with Li⁺.\n    *   We need to compare the directing strength of these two groups. The generally accepted order of directing strength for common groups is: -C(=O)NR₂ > -OR > -NR₂.\n    *   Therefore, the **N,N-diethylamide group is a much stronger directing group** than the dimethylamino group. The lithiation will be directed to one of its ortho positions.\n    *   The positions ortho to the amide group at C1 are **C2** and **C6**.\n    *   The proton at **C2** is also ortho to the dimethylamino group at C3. This means both directing groups synergistically activate the C-H bond at C2, making this proton the most acidic and the most kinetically favorable site for deprotonation.\n    *   The proton at **C6** is only ortho to the strong amide directing group.\n    *   Consequently, the sec-BuLi will selectively deprotonate the ring at position **C2**, replacing the hydrogen atom with a lithium atom. This forms an aryllithium intermediate: **2-lithio-N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide**.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Second Reagent:**\n    *   **Methyl iodide (CH₃I):** This is an electrophile. The carbon atom in the methyl group is electron-deficient and is susceptible to attack by a nucleophile.\n\n5.  **Predict the Second Reaction Step:**\n    *   The aryllithium intermediate formed in the first step is a powerful nucleophile (essentially a carbanion at C2).\n    *   This nucleophilic carbon at C2 will attack the electrophilic methyl group of methyl iodide.\n    *   This is a nucleophilic substitution reaction (SN2-like), where a new C-C bond is formed between the aromatic ring and the methyl group, and iodide (I⁻) is expelled as a leaving group.\n\n6.  **Determine the Final Product:**\n    *   The lithium atom at C2 is replaced by a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   Starting with N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide, a methyl group is introduced at the C2 position.\n    *   The name of the final product is **N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide**.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider:\n\n*   **Relative Strength of Directing Groups:** Correctly identifying that the amide group is a stronger directing group than the amino group is crucial for determining the correct regiochemistry.\n*   **Synergistic Effect:** Recognizing that both directing groups activate the C2 position ensures the high selectivity of the reaction.\n*   **Reactivity:** The aryllithium intermediate is a much stronger nucleophile than the nitrogen atom of the dimethylamino group. Therefore, methylation occurs on the carbon ring rather than on the nitrogen (which would form a quaternary ammonium salt), especially under controlled low-temperature conditions.\n*   **Reagent Roles:** Understand that sec-BuLi is the base for deprotonation and CH₃I is the electrophile that \"quenches\" the nucleophilic intermediate.\n\n### Final Conclusion:\nThe reaction sequence involves a directed ortho-metalation at the C2 position, guided by the powerful amide directing group, followed by an electrophilic quench with methyl iodide. This results in the substitution of the C2 hydrogen with a methyl group.\n\n<<<N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide>>>"
