    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rank of the third homotopy group of a smooth quintic hypersurface in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Object and the Goal\n*   **The object:** $X$ is a smooth quintic hypersurface in complex projective 3-space, $\\mathbb{CP}^3$.\n    *   This means $X$ is defined by a single homogeneous polynomial equation of degree 5.\n    *   The ambient space is $\\mathbb{CP}^3$, which is a complex manifold of dimension 3 (real dimension 6).\n    *   $X$ is a hypersurface, so its complex dimension is $\\dim_{\\mathbb{C}}(X) = \\dim_{\\mathbb{C}}(\\mathbb{CP}^3) - 1 = 3 - 1 = 2$.\n    *   As a real manifold, the dimension of $X$ is $\\dim_{\\mathbb{R}}(X) = 2 \\times 2 = 4$.\n    *   Being a smooth projective variety, $X$ is a compact, connected, orientable manifold.\n*   **The goal:** We want to find the rank of the third homotopy group, $\\pi_3(X)$.\n\n### Step 2: Relate Homotopy Groups to Homology Groups\nThe rank of a finitely generated abelian group is the dimension of the vector space obtained by tensoring the group with the field of rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$. While homotopy groups can be very complex, their ranks are often accessible through homology.\n\n*   **Hurewicz Theorem (mod C version by Serre):** For any simply connected topological space $Y$, the Hurewicz homomorphism $h_k: \\pi_k(Y) \\to H_k(Y; \\mathbb{Z})$ has a kernel and cokernel that are torsion groups for all $k \\ge 1$.\n*   **Consequence for Ranks:** This implies that when we tensor with $\\mathbb{Q}$ (which kills torsion), the map $h_k \\otimes \\text{id}_{\\mathbb{Q}}: \\pi_k(Y) \\otimes \\mathbb{Q} \\to H_k(Y; \\mathbb{Z}) \\otimes \\mathbb{Q}$ becomes an isomorphism. The dimension of the vector space on the left is the rank of $\\pi_k(Y)$, and the dimension of the space on the right is the $k$-th Betti number, $b_k(Y)$.\n*   **Applying to X:** We first need to check if $X$ is simply connected ($\\pi_1(X)=0$). We can use the Lefschetz Hyperplane Theorem for this (see next step). Assuming it is, our problem reduces to finding the third Betti number, $b_3(X)$.\n    *   **rank($\\pi_3(X)) = b_3(X)$**\n\n### Step 3: Use Poincaré Duality\nPoincaré duality is a powerful tool for relating the Betti numbers of a manifold.\n\n*   **Poincaré Duality Theorem:** For any compact, orientable, n-dimensional manifold $M$, the Betti numbers satisfy $b_k(M) = b_{n-k}(M)$.\n*   **Applying to X:** As established in Step 1, $X$ is a compact, orientable 4-dimensional manifold. Therefore, we can apply Poincaré duality with $n=4$. For $k=3$, we get:\n    *   $b_3(X) = b_{4-3}(X) = b_1(X)$.\n*   This simplifies our problem further: we now need to find the first Betti number, $b_1(X)$.\n\n### Step 4: Use the Lefschetz Hyperplane Theorem\nThe Lefschetz Hyperplane Theorem relates the topology of a hypersurface to the topology of the ambient projective space.\n\n*   **Lefschetz Hyperplane Theorem (Homology Version):** Let $X$ be a smooth complex hypersurface of dimension $m-1$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^m$. The inclusion map $i: X \\to \\mathbb{CP}^m$ induces isomorphisms $i_*: H_k(X; \\mathbb{Z}) \\to H_k(\\mathbb{CP}^m; \\mathbb{Z})$ for all $k < m-1$.\n*   **Applying to X:** In our case, $X$ has dimension 2 in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$, so $m=3$. The theorem guarantees an isomorphism for $k < 3-1 = 2$. For $k=1$, we have:\n    *   $H_1(X; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong H_1(\\mathbb{CP}^3; \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\n### Step 5: Determine the Homology of $\\mathbb{CP}^3$\nThe homology of complex projective spaces is well-known and simple.\n\n*   $\\mathbb{CP}^n$ has a cell structure with a single cell in each even real dimension $0, 2, 4, ..., 2n$. The differentials in the cellular chain complex are all zero.\n*   For $\\mathbb{CP}^3$, the homology groups are:\n    *   $H_0(\\mathbb{CP}^3; \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}$\n    *   $H_1(\\mathbb{CP}^3; \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$\n    *   $H_2(\\mathbb{CP}^3; \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}$\n    *   etc.\n*   The key result for us is that $H_1(\\mathbb{CP}^3; \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$, which means $b_1(\\mathbb{CP}^3) = 0$.\n\n### Step 6: Assemble the Final Answer\nWe now combine the results from the previous steps in a logical chain.\n\n1.  From Step 5, we know $b_1(\\mathbb{CP}^3) = 0$.\n2.  From Step 4 (Lefschetz), we have $H_1(X; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong H_1(\\mathbb{CP}^3; \\mathbb{Z})$. Therefore, $H_1(X; \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$, which means $b_1(X)=0$.\n3.  From Step 3 (Poincaré Duality), we have $b_3(X) = b_1(X)$. Since $b_1(X)=0$, we conclude that $b_3(X)=0$.\n4.  From Step 2 (Hurewicz/Serre), the rank of $\\pi_3(X)$ is equal to $b_3(X)$.\n5.  Therefore, the rank of $\\pi_3(X)$ is 0.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Correctly identifying the manifold:** $X$ is a 4-dimensional real manifold, which is crucial for applying Poincaré Duality correctly.\n*   **Using the correct theorems:** The chain of reasoning relies on three fundamental and powerful theorems: Hurewicz/Serre (relating homotopy rank to Betti numbers), Poincaré Duality (relating $b_3$ to $b_1$), and the Lefschetz Hyperplane Theorem (relating $b_1(X)$ to $b_1(\\mathbb{CP}^3)$).\n*   **Checking preconditions:** It is important to verify that the preconditions for these theorems are met.\n    *   `Hurewicz/Serre`: Requires the space to be simply connected. The Lefschetz theorem for homotopy states $\\pi_1(X) \\cong \\pi_1(\\mathbb{CP}^3) = 0$, so $X$ is simply connected.\n    *   `Poincaré Duality`: Requires the manifold to be compact and orientable. As a smooth projective variety, $X$ has these properties.\n    *   `Lefschetz Hyperplane Theorem`: Requires a smooth hypersurface, which is given.\n*   **The degree does not matter:** Notice that the degree of the hypersurface (quintic, $d=5$) did not enter this specific calculation. The result that $b_1(X)=b_3(X)=0$ holds for any smooth hypersurface in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$. The degree *does* affect other topological invariants like the second Betti number $b_2(X)$ and the Euler characteristic $\\chi(X)$.\n\nFinal Answer Derivation:\n$$ \\text{rank}(\\pi_3(X)) \\overset{\\text{Hurewicz}}{=} b_3(X) \\overset{\\text{Poincaré}}{=} b_1(X) \\overset{\\text{Lefschetz}}{=} b_1(\\mathbb{CP}^3) = 0 $$\n\n<<<0>>>"
