    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Definitions\n\nFirst, let's ensure we understand all the terminology in the question.\n\n*   **Product-Free Set:** A subset `S` of a group `G` is product-free if for any two elements `x, y ∈ S` (not necessarily distinct), their product `xy` is not an element of `S`. In other words, `SS ∩ S = ∅`.\n*   **Maximal by Inclusion Product-Free Set:** A product-free set `S` is maximal by inclusion (or simply, a maximal product-free set) if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set. This means that for any element `g ∈ G \\ S`, the set `S ∪ {g}` is no longer product-free.\n*   **A Set `S` Fills `G`:** A subset `S` fills the group `G` if `G = S ∪ S⁻¹ ∪ SS ∪ {e}`, where `e` is the identity element, `S⁻¹ = {s⁻¹ | s ∈ S}`, and `SS = {s₁s₂ | s₁, s₂ ∈ S}`.\n*   **Filled Group:** A group `G` is called a \"filled group\" if *every* maximal product-free set in `G` fills `G`.\n*   **The Group in Question:** We are looking for all groups `G` that are **nonabelian**, have an order of `|G| = 2q^m` (where `q` is an odd prime and `m` is a natural number, i.e., `m ≥ 1`), and are **filled**.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Structure of Groups of Order 2q^m\n\nLet `G` be a group of order `|G| = 2q^m`. We can use Sylow's Theorems to understand its structure.\n\n1.  Let `n_q` be the number of Sylow `q`-subgroups. According to Sylow's Third Theorem, `n_q` must divide `|G| / q^m = 2`, so `n_q` can be 1 or 2. Also, `n_q ≡ 1 (mod q)`.\n2.  Since `q` is an odd prime, `q ≥ 3`. The condition `2 ≡ 1 (mod q)` would imply that `q` divides `1`, which is impossible. Therefore, `n_q` cannot be 2.\n3.  This forces `n_q = 1`. A unique Sylow subgroup is always a normal subgroup. So, the Sylow `q`-subgroup, let's call it `Q` (with `|Q| = q^m`), is normal in `G`.\n4.  Let `P` be a Sylow 2-subgroup. Its order is `|P| = 2`, so `P` is isomorphic to the cyclic group `C₂`.\n5.  Since `Q` is a normal subgroup, `G` is a semidirect product of `Q` and `P`, written as `G = Q ⋊ P`.\n6.  The question specifies that `G` must be **nonabelian**. This means the semidirect product cannot be a direct product. A direct product `Q × P` would be abelian if `Q` were abelian, and for G to be nonabelian even if `Q` were nonabelian, there would have to be a nontrivial action. The nonabelian nature implies there is a non-trivial homomorphism from `P ≅ C₂` to the automorphism group `Aut(Q)`. This means the generator of `P` (an element of order 2) acts non-trivially on `Q` by conjugation.\n\n### Step 3: Apply Known Theorems about Filled Groups\n\nThe property of being \"filled\" is quite restrictive. Research in this specific area of group theory has yielded powerful classification theorems. The most relevant theorem for this problem is:\n\n**Theorem (Ghorbani & Ghasemi, 2014):** A finite non-abelian group `G` is a filled group if and only if `G` is a 2-group.\n\nA **2-group** is a group whose order is a power of 2 (i.e., `|G| = 2^k` for some integer `k ≥ 0`).\n\n### Step 4: Combine Group Structure with the Filled Group Theorem\n\nNow we can use the theorem from Step 3 to analyze the group `G` from Step 2.\n\n1.  We are looking for a **nonabelian filled group** `G`.\n2.  According to the theorem, if such a group `G` exists, it must be a **2-group**.\n3.  This means the order of `G`, `|G|`, must be a power of 2.\n4.  The order of our group is given as `|G| = 2q^m`, where `q` is an **odd prime** (`q ≥ 3`) and `m` is a natural number (`m ≥ 1`).\n5.  For `|G| = 2q^m` to be a power of 2, the term `q^m` must not have any odd prime factors.\n6.  Since `q` is an odd prime, this is only possible if `q^m = 1`. This would require `m = 0`.\n7.  However, the problem states that `m` is a natural number, which standardly means `m ∈ {1, 2, 3, ...}`. For any `m ≥ 1`, `q^m` will be an odd number greater than 1.\n8.  Therefore, `|G| = 2q^m` is not a power of 2.\n\n### Step 5: Conclusion\n\nThe requirement for `G` to be a nonabelian filled group necessitates its order being a power of 2. The given order `2q^m` (for an odd prime `q` and `m ≥ 1`) is demonstrably not a power of 2. This is a direct contradiction.\n\nTherefore, no group can satisfy all the given conditions simultaneously. The set of nonabelian filled groups of order `2q^m` is empty.\n\n**Alternative Argument (Using Nilpotency):**\n\nWe can also use a related theorem: \"A finite non-nilpotent group `G` is filled if and only if `G` does not have a subgroup of odd prime order.\"\n\n1.  As shown in Step 2, a nonabelian group `G` of order `2q^m` is a non-trivial semidirect product `Q ⋊ C₂`.\n2.  A finite group is nilpotent if and only if it is the direct product of its Sylow subgroups. Since our semidirect product is not direct, `G` is **non-nilpotent**.\n3.  Now, we apply the theorem. For the non-nilpotent group `G` to be filled, it must not have any subgroups of odd prime order.\n4.  By Cauchy's Theorem, since the odd prime `q` divides `|G|`, `G` must have an element of order `q`, and thus a subgroup of order `q`.\n5.  This means `G` *does* have a subgroup of odd prime order.\n6.  Therefore, `G` cannot be a filled group. This confirms the previous conclusion.\n\nFinal answer: There are no such groups.\n\n<<<There are no such groups.>>>"
