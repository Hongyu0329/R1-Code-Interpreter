    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Starting Molecule and the Process\n\n*   **Molecule:** The starting molecule is glucose. Glucose is a 6-carbon sugar.\n*   **Labeling:** It is labeled with the carbon-13 isotope (¹³C) at positions 1 and 4. We can represent this as 1,4-¹³C glucose.\n    ```\n      CHO   (Carbon 1, labeled ¹³C)\n      |\n    H-C-OH  (Carbon 2)\n      |\n   HO-C-H   (Carbon 3)\n      |\n    H-C-OH  (Carbon 4, labeled ¹³C)\n      |\n    H-C-OH  (Carbon 5)\n      |\n     CH2OH  (Carbon 6)\n    ```\n*   **Process:** The molecule goes through \"glycolysis\". Glycolysis is the metabolic pathway that breaks down the 6-carbon glucose into two 3-carbon molecules of pyruvate.\n\n### Step 2: Trace the Labeled Carbons Through Glycolysis\n\n1.  **Glucose to Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (FBP):** In the initial steps of glycolysis (the preparatory phase), glucose is converted to fructose-1,6-bisphosphate. These steps involve phosphorylation and isomerization, but the carbon skeleton is not broken. Therefore, the ¹³C labels remain at the C1 and C4 positions of FBP.\n\n2.  **Cleavage of Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate:** This is a critical step. The enzyme Aldolase cleaves the 6-carbon FBP molecule into two 3-carbon molecules:\n    *   **Dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP):** Formed from carbons 1, 2, and 3 of FBP. This molecule contains the ¹³C label from the original C1 of glucose.\n    *   **Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P):** Formed from carbons 4, 5, and 6 of FBP. This molecule contains the ¹³C label from the original C4 of glucose.\n\n3.  **Fate of the Two 3-Carbon Molecules:**\n    *   The first G3P molecule (from carbons 4, 5, 6 of glucose) has the ¹³C label at its C1 position (the aldehyde carbon), as glucose's C4 becomes G3P's C1.\n    *   The DHAP molecule (from carbons 1, 2, 3 of glucose) is then converted into a second molecule of G3P by the enzyme Triose Phosphate Isomerase. The C1 of DHAP becomes the C1 of this new G3P. Therefore, this second G3P molecule is also labeled at its C1 position.\n    *   **Conclusion so far:** At this stage, the single molecule of 1,4-¹³C glucose has been converted into **two** molecules of 1-¹³C glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate.\n\n4.  **Conversion to Pyruvate:** In the payoff phase of glycolysis, each molecule of G3P is converted into a molecule of pyruvate. The carbon backbone remains intact. The C1 of G3P becomes the C1 (carboxyl carbon, -COO⁻) of pyruvate.\n    *   **Conclusion at the end of glycolysis:** The two molecules of 1-¹³C G3P become **two** molecules of 1-¹³C pyruvate.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Release of CO₂\n\n*   **Careful Point:** The glycolysis pathway itself (glucose → 2 pyruvate) does not release any CO₂. All 6 carbons from glucose are present in the two pyruvate molecules.\n*   However, the question asks \"how many ¹³C-labeled CO₂ molecules will be released,\" which implies that a subsequent CO₂-releasing step should be considered. The fate of pyruvate depends on the organism and the presence of oxygen.\n*   **Common Fates of Pyruvate involving CO₂ release:**\n    1.  **Aerobic Respiration (Link Reaction):** Pyruvate is converted to acetyl-CoA by the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. This reaction releases the C1 (carboxyl carbon) of pyruvate as CO₂.\n    2.  **Alcoholic Fermentation (in yeast):** Pyruvate is converted to ethanol. This two-step process involves a first step where pyruvate is decarboxylated to acetaldehyde, releasing the C1 (carboxyl carbon) as CO₂.\n\n*   In both of these common metabolic pathways, the carbon atom released as CO₂ is the C1 of pyruvate.\n\n### Step 4: Final Calculation\n\n1.  From our tracing, we determined that one molecule of 1,4-¹³C glucose yields two molecules of pyruvate.\n2.  Both of these pyruvate molecules are labeled with ¹³C at their C1 position.\n3.  The metabolic step that releases CO₂ (either the link reaction or alcoholic fermentation) removes this specific C1 carbon.\n4.  Therefore, each of the two pyruvate molecules will release one molecule of ¹³C-labeled CO₂.\n\n**Total ¹³C-labeled CO₂ molecules released = 2.**\n\n<<<2>>>"
