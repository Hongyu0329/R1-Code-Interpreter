    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the standard Japanese pitch accent pattern of 「弟」.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the word and its pronunciation.**\nThe kanji is 「弟」.\nIts standard Japanese reading is 「おとうと」 (otouto).\n\n**Step 2: Break the word into morae.**\nA mora is a unit of sound that determines timing and rhythm in Japanese.\n「おとうと」 (otouto) consists of four morae:\n1.  お (o)\n2.  と (to)\n3.  う (u) - This is the long vowel part of \"tou\".\n4.  と (to)\n\n**Step 3: Understand the main Japanese pitch accent patterns.**\nStandard Japanese (Tokyo dialect) has four main patterns:\n*   **A. Heiban (平板式 - \"flat type\"):** The pitch starts low on the first mora, rises on the second, and stays high for the rest of the word and any following particles. This is represented by the number [0].\n*   **B. Atamadaka (頭高式 - \"head-high type\"):** The pitch is high on the first mora and drops on all subsequent morae. This is represented by [1].\n*   **C. Nakadaka (中高式 - \"middle-high type\"):** The pitch starts low, rises on the second mora, and falls on a specific mora in the middle of the word. For a four-mora word, this could be [2] (falls after the 2nd mora) or [3] (falls after the 3rd mora).\n*   **D. Odaka (尾高式 - \"tail-high type\"):** The pitch starts low, rises on the second mora, and stays high until the last mora of the word. The pitch then drops on the particle that follows. For a four-mora word, this pattern is represented by [4].\n\n**Step 4: Determine the pitch accent for 「弟」 (otouto).**\nWe need to find out which of these patterns applies to 「おとうと」. According to standard Japanese accent dictionaries like the NHK日本語発音アクセント新辞典 or the Online Japanese Accent Dictionary (OJAD), the pitch accent for 「おとうと」 is [0].\n\n**Step 5: Match the accent number to the pattern.**\nThe accent number [0] corresponds to the **Heiban (平板)** pattern.\n\n**Step 6: Visualize the Heiban pattern for 「おとうと」 (otouto).**\n*   The first mora 「お」 is pronounced with a low pitch.\n*   The second mora 「と」 rises to a high pitch.\n*   The remaining morae 「う」 and 「と」 continue at a high pitch.\n*   So the pattern is: お(L) と(H) う(H) と(H).\n*   If a particle like 「が」 (ga) follows, it also remains high: お(L) と(H) う(H) と(H) が(H).\n\n**Step 7: Compare with the answer choices.**\nBased on our analysis, the pitch accent pattern for 「弟」 (otouto) is Heiban. This directly matches choice A.\n\n*   A. Heiban - **Correct.**\n*   B. Atamadaka - Incorrect. This would be お(H) と(L) う(L) と(L).\n*   C. Nakadaka - Incorrect. This would involve a drop within the word, e.g., お(L) と(H) う(H) と(L).\n*   D. Odaka - Incorrect. This would be お(L) と(H) う(H) と(H) but with a drop on the following particle, e.g., が(L).\n*   E. Heiban or Nakadaka - Incorrect, because the standard pattern is specifically Heiban.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe standard Japanese pitch accent for 「弟」 (otouto) is Heiban.\n\n<<<A>>>"
