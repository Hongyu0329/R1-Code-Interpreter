    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the SKI combinator expression.\n\n**Step 1: Decompose the Expression's Structure**\n\nThe expression is `S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(A))))(B))`, where `A` and `B` are large sub-expressions.\nLet's analyze the structure `S(I) F G`. The reduction rule for `S` is `S x y z => x z (y z)`, and for `I` is `I x => x`.\n`S(I) F G` reduces as follows:\n`S(I) F G => I G (F G) => G (F G)`\n\nLet's apply this reduction rule repeatedly to the given expression.\nLet `Expr = S(I) (S(I)(S(I)(K(X)))) (Y)`.\nLet `F_3 = S(I)(S(I)(K(X)))`. The expression is `S(I) F_3 Y`.\nThis reduces to `Y (F_3 Y)`.\n\nNow let's reduce `F_3 Y`:\n`F_3 Y = (S(I)(S(I)(K(X)))) Y`\nLet `F_2 = S(I)(K(X))`. Then `F_3 Y = (S(I) F_2) Y`.\nThis reduces to `Y (F_2 Y)`.\n\nNow let's reduce `F_2 Y`:\n`F_2 Y = (S(I)(K(X))) Y`.\nThis reduces to `Y ((K(X)) Y)`.\nThe reduction for `K` is `K a b => a`. So, `(K X) Y => X`.\nThus, `F_2 Y` reduces to `Y(X)`.\n\nSubstituting back:\n*   `F_3 Y` becomes `Y(Y(X))`.\n*   The full expression `Expr` becomes `Y(Y(Y(X)))`.\n\nSo, the expression evaluates to the result of applying function `Y` three times to the argument `X`. This structure is analogous to the church numeral `3` being applied to a function and an argument: `3 Y X`.\n\n**Step 2: Identify and Analyze X and Y**\n\nFrom the original expression, we can identify `X` and `Y`:\n*   `Y = S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I))`\n*   `X = S(S(K(S))(K))(I)` (This is the argument inside the `K` combinator)\n\nLet's analyze the operator common to both `X` and `Y`:\nLet `Op = S(S(K(S))(K))`.\nThe combinator `B = S(K S) K` is the function composition combinator, `B f g x = f(g x)`. Note that `S(K(S))(K)` is equivalent to `S(K S)K`.\nThe operator `Op` is `S B`. Let's see how `S B` acts on two church numerals, `m` and `n`.\n`Op m n = (S B) m n = B m n = m . n` (composition of `m` and `n`).\nFor church numerals, the composition `m . n` corresponds to multiplication.\n`(m . n) f x = m(n f) x`. This is the definition of `MULT m n`.\nSo, `Op` is the multiplication operator for church numerals: `Op = MULT`.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate X**\n\n`X = Op I = MULT I`.\nIn SKI logic, the identity combinator `I` corresponds to the church numeral `1`. Let's verify:\n`1 f x = f x`.\n`I f x = f x`.\nSo, `I` is `1`.\n`X = MULT 1`. The operator `MULT 1` applied to any numeral `k` yields `k` (`1 * k = k`). Therefore, `MULT 1` is the identity function on numerals. However, the expression `S(S(K(S))(K))(I)` itself, when fully reduced, is the numeral `1`.\nLet's verify: `(S B I) f x = B I f x = I(f x) = f x`. This is precisely the behavior of the numeral `1`.\nSo, `X = 1`.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Function Y**\n\n`Y = Op (S(I)(I)) = MULT (S(I)(I))`.\nLet's analyze `M = S(I)(I)`.\n`M x = (S I I) x = I x (I x) = x x`. `M` is the self-application combinator. `M` is not a church numeral.\nTherefore, `Y` is not a numeral itself, but a function that takes a numeral and produces a new object. `Y` is the `MULT` operator partially applied to `M`.\nLet's see what `Y` does when applied to a church numeral `k`.\n`Y(k) = (MULT M) k = B M k = M . k`\nSo, `Y(k)` is the composition of `M` and `k`.\n`Y(k) = λf. M(k f)`.\nSince `M(z) = z z`, we have:\n`Y(k) = λf. (k f)(k f)`.\n\nLet's see what numeral `Y(k)` corresponds to. Let `k'` be the numeral for `Y(k)`. We test its behavior on a generic function `g` and argument `y`.\n`k' g y = (Y(k)) g y = (λf. (k f)(k f)) g y = ((k g)(k g)) y`.\nApplication is left-associative, so this is `((k g) (k g)) y`. The function `(k g)` is applied to itself, and the result is applied to `y`.\nLet `h = k g`. The expression is `(h h) y`.\n`h` is the function `λz. g^k z`. So `h` applies `g`, `k` times.\n`h h = h(h) = (g^k)(h)`. This means we apply the function `g^k` to the function `h`.\nThis gives `g(g(...g(h)...))` where `g` is applied `k` times.\nLet's analyze the result applied to `y`: `(g^k(h))(y)`.\nIn combinator logic, this typically implies composition if types are to be preserved: `g^k(h(y))`.\n`h(y) = g^k y`.\nSo, `g^k(h(y)) = g^k(g^k y) = g^(k+k) y = g^(2k) y`.\nThis shows that `Y(k)` is the church numeral for `2k`. `Y` is the `DOUBLING` function.\n\nHowever, a more rigorous analysis of `(h h) y = (h(h))(y)` where `h = 2g = g.g` gives:\n`h(h) = g(g(h))`. Then `(g(g(h)))(y)` becomes `g(g(h(y)))` which is `g(g(g(g(y))))=g^4(y)`.\nThis shows that `Y(2)=4`. By extension, `Y(k) = k^2`. `Y` is the **SQUARING** function.\n\n**Step 5: Final Calculation**\n\nWe need to evaluate `E = Y(Y(Y(X)))`.\nWe have `X = 1` and `Y = SQUARING` operator.\n1.  `Y(X) = Y(1) = 1^2 = 1`.\n2.  `Y(Y(X)) = Y(1) = 1^2 = 1`.\n3.  `Y(Y(Y(X))) = Y(1) = 1^2 = 1`.\n\nSo, the expression evaluates to the church numeral `1`.\n`n = 1`.\nThe question asks for `log_2(n)`.\n`log_2(1) = 0`.\n\n**Alternative Interpretation Check**\nWhat if `(k g) (k g)` implies composition, i.e., `(k g) . (k g)`?\nIn that case, `Y(k) = λf. (k f) . (k f)`.\n`Y(k)` applied to `x` is `(k f) ((k f) x) = f^k(f^k x) = f^(2k) x`. So `Y` is `DOUBLING`.\nThen `E = Y(Y(Y(1)))` would be:\n1. `Y(1) = 2*1 = 2`.\n2. `Y(2) = 2*2 = 4`.\n3. `Y(4) = 2*4 = 8`.\nSo `n=8` and `log_2(n) = 3`.\n\nAnother interpretation: `Y(1) = 2` (since `1f.1f = f.f = 2f`), `Y(k)=k^2`.\n1. `Y(1) = 2`.\n2. `Y(2) = 2^2 = 4`.\n3. `Y(4) = 4^2 = 16`.\nSo `n=16` and `log_2(n)=4`.\n\nGiven the ambiguity in interpreting higher-order applications, we choose the most rigorous path. The strict evaluation of `(h(h))(y)` where `h=2g` led to `g^4(y)`, confirming `Y(2)=4`. This strongly suggests `Y` is squaring. The squaring logic leads to `n=1`.\n\n`log_2(1) = 0`."
