    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of power subgroups in the generalized quaternion group of size 128.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the definitions\n*   **Generalized Quaternion Group:** The generalized quaternion group of order $2^n$, denoted $Q_{2^n}$, has the presentation:\n    $Q_{2^n} = \\langle x, y \\mid x^{2^{n-1}} = 1, y^2 = x^{2^{n-2}}, y^{-1}xy = x^{-1} \\rangle$.\n    For this problem, the group size is 128, so we have $128 = 2^7$, which means $n=7$. The group is $G = Q_{128}$, with the presentation:\n    $G = \\langle x, y \\mid x^{64} = 1, y^2 = x^{32}, y^{-1}xy = x^{-1} \\rangle$.\n    The elements of $G$ are of the form $x^i$ for $0 \\leq i < 64$ and $yx^i$ for $0 \\leq i < 64$. The subgroup $\\langle x \\rangle$ is a cyclic group of order 64.\n\n*   **Power Subgroup:** A subgroup $H$ of a group $G$ is a power subgroup if there exists an integer $k$ such that $H$ is the set of all $k$-th powers of elements of $G$. This is denoted as $H = G^k = \\{g^k \\mid g \\in G\\}$.\n    Since $Q_{128}$ is a 2-group, it is nilpotent, which guarantees that for any integer $k$, the set $G^k$ is indeed a subgroup of $G$.\n\n### Step 2: Compute the power subgroups $G^k$\nWe need to determine the set $G^k$ for an arbitrary integer $k$. We can do this by computing the $k$-th powers of all elements in $G$. It is helpful to analyze the cases where $k$ is odd and where $k$ is even.\n\n**Case 1: $k$ is odd**\nLet $k$ be an odd integer.\n*   For elements in the cyclic subgroup $\\langle x \\rangle$, the $k$-th powers are $(x^i)^k = x^{ik}$. Since $k$ is odd, $\\gcd(k, 64) = 1$. This means the map $z \\mapsto z^k$ is an automorphism of $\\langle x \\rangle$, so the set $\\{x^{ik} \\mid 0 \\le i < 64\\}$ is equal to $\\langle x \\rangle$.\n*   For elements not in $\\langle x \\rangle$, which have the form $yx^i$, we first compute their square:\n    $(yx^i)^2 = (yx^i)(yx^i) = y(x^iy)x^i = y(yx^{-i})x^i = y^2x^{-i}x^i = y^2 = x^{32}$.\n    Since $k$ is odd, we can write $k = 2m+1$ for some integer $m$.\n    $(yx^i)^k = (yx^i)^{2m+1} = ((yx^i)^2)^m (yx^i) = (x^{32})^m yx^i = x^{32m} yx^i$.\n    As $i$ varies from 0 to 63, the term $yx^i$ covers all elements in the coset $y\\langle x \\rangle$. The set of powers $\\{x^{32m} yx^i \\mid 0 \\le i < 64\\}$ is the entire coset $y\\langle x \\rangle$.\n*   Combining these results, for any odd $k$, the set of all $k$-th powers is $G^k = \\langle x \\rangle \\cup y\\langle x \\rangle = G$.\n*   Therefore, any odd value of $k$ generates the same power subgroup, which is the group $G$ itself. This gives us **1** power subgroup.\n\n**Case 2: $k$ is even**\nLet $k$ be an even integer. We can write $k=2m$ for some integer $m \\ge 1$.\n*   For elements in $\\langle x \\rangle$, the $k$-th powers are $(x^i)^k = (x^i)^{2m} = x^{2im}$. The set of all such powers is the subgroup $\\langle x^{2m} \\rangle$.\n*   For elements of the form $yx^i$, the $k$-th powers are $(yx^i)^k = (yx^i)^{2m} = ((yx^i)^2)^m = (x^{32})^m = x^{32m}$.\n*   Combining these, the power subgroup $G^k$ is the set $G^{2m} = \\{x^{2im} \\mid 0 \\le i < 64\\} \\cup \\{x^{32m}\\} = \\langle x^{2m} \\rangle \\cup \\{x^{32m}\\}$.\n*   The element $x^{32m}$ is $(x^{2m})^{16}$, so it is already an element of the subgroup $\\langle x^{2m} \\rangle$.\n*   Thus, for any even $k=2m$, the power subgroup is $G^k = \\langle x^{2m} \\rangle$.\n\n### Step 3: Identify the distinct subgroups generated in the even case\nNow we need to find how many distinct subgroups can be formed as $\\langle x^{2m} \\rangle$ for $m \\ge 1$.\nThe subgroup $\\langle x^a \\rangle$ in a cyclic group of order 64 is determined by $\\gcd(a, 64)$. So, we need to find all possible values of $d = \\gcd(2m, 64)$ as $m$ varies.\n$d = \\gcd(2m, 2^6) = 2 \\cdot \\gcd(m, 2^5) = 2 \\cdot \\gcd(m, 32)$.\nSince $m$ can be any positive integer, $\\gcd(m, 32)$ can be any divisor of 32. The divisors of 32 are $\\{1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32\\}$.\nSo, the possible values for $d$ are:\n*   If $\\gcd(m, 32) = 1$ (e.g., $m=1$), $d = 2 \\cdot 1 = 2$. This gives the subgroup $\\langle x^2 \\rangle$.\n*   If $\\gcd(m, 32) = 2$ (e.g., $m=2$), $d = 2 \\cdot 2 = 4$. This gives the subgroup $\\langle x^4 \\rangle$.\n*   If $\\gcd(m, 32) = 4$ (e.g., $m=4$), $d = 2 \\cdot 4 = 8$. This gives the subgroup $\\langle x^8 \\rangle$.\n*   If $\\gcd(m, 32) = 8$ (e.g., $m=8$), $d = 2 \\cdot 8 = 16$. This gives the subgroup $\\langle x^{16} \\rangle$.\n*   If $\\gcd(m, 32) = 16$ (e.g., $m=16$), $d = 2 \\cdot 16 = 32$. This gives the subgroup $\\langle x^{32} \\rangle$.\n*   If $\\gcd(m, 32) = 32$ (e.g., $m=32$), $d = 2 \\cdot 32 = 64$. This gives the subgroup $\\langle x^{64} \\rangle = \\{1\\}$ (the trivial subgroup).\n\nThese 6 subgroups are all distinct, as they have different orders (32, 16, 8, 4, 2, and 1, respectively). So, there are **6** distinct power subgroups that arise from even values of $k$.\n\n### Step 4: Final Count\nCombining the results from both cases:\n1.  From odd $k$: The group $G = Q_{128}$ itself.\n2.  From even $k$: The 6 cyclic subgroups $\\langle x^2 \\rangle, \\langle x^4 \\rangle, \\langle x^8 \\rangle, \\langle x^{16} \\rangle, \\langle x^{32} \\rangle, \\{1\\}$.\n\nThe subgroup $G$ is not in the second list, as it has order 128 and is non-cyclic. All subgroups in the second list are distinct from each other.\nThus, the total number of distinct power subgroups is $1 + 6 = 7$."
