    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the User's Question**\nThe question asks for the specific year when a person named \"Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan\" publicly identified himself as \"azikiwe\".\n\n**Step 2: Verify the Name**\nThe first crucial point is to verify the name \"Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan\".\n*   The former President of Nigeria is universally known as **Goodluck Ebele Jonathan**.\n*   **Nnamdi Azikiwe** was a different prominent Nigerian statesman, who served as the first President of Nigeria.\n*   A thorough check of official records, biographical data, and reliable news archives confirms that \"Azikiwe\" is not part of Goodluck Jonathan's official name. The name in the question appears to be a conflation of two different Nigerian presidents.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Action \"publicly identify himself as azikiwe\"**\nThis part of the question assumes that Goodluck Ebele Jonathan, at some point, made a public declaration or took on the name \"Azikiwe\". This could mean:\n*   A legal name change.\n*   Adopting it as a nickname or title.\n*   A significant speech where he claimed this identity.\n\n**Step 4: Search for Evidence**\nA comprehensive search for any instance of Goodluck Jonathan identifying as \"Azikiwe\" is necessary.\n*   Searching for news articles, official statements, or records of him using the name \"Azikiwe\" for himself yields no results.\n*   There are no credible reports of him ever changing his name or being conferred with a title that included \"Azikiwe\".\n*   While his actions or policies may have been compared to those of Nnamdi Azikiwe by political analysts, he himself never adopted the name.\n\n**Step 5: Conclusion from the Analysis**\nThe premise of the question is incorrect. Goodluck Ebele Jonathan's name does not include \"Azikiwe,\" and there is no record of him ever publicly identifying himself as such. The question is based on false information. Therefore, it is impossible to provide a year for an event that never occurred.\n\n**Final Answer Acquisition**\nSince the event described in the question never happened, there is no year to provide. The correct answer must state this fact clearly.\n\n<<<There is no record of Goodluck Ebele Jonathan ever publicly identifying himself as Azikiwe, as this is not part of his name. Therefore, this event never occurred."
