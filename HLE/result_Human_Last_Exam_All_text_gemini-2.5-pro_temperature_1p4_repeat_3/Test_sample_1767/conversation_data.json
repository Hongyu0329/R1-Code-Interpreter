    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Problem Statement\n\n*   **System:** A junction is formed by two distinct systems.\n*   **Components:** Each system is a Chern insulator.\n*   **Topological Property:** Each Chern insulator has a Chern number of $C=1$.\n*   **Geometry:** The two insulators are connected \"laterally\", meaning side-by-side.\n*   **Coupling:** The tunneling barrier between them is \"negligible\". This implies they are strongly coupled and effectively form a single, larger system.\n*   **Question:** What is the Chern number of the resulting combined system (the junction)?\n\n### Step 2: Recall the Physical Meaning of the Chern Number\n\nThe Chern number ($C$) is an integer topological invariant that characterizes the bulk of a 2D material. It has two key physical manifestations:\n\n1.  **Quantized Hall Conductance:** The Hall conductance ($\\sigma_{xy}$) of the material is quantized in units of the conductance quantum ($e^2/h$). Specifically, $\\sigma_{xy} = C \\frac{e^2}{h}$.\n2.  **Chiral Edge States (Bulk-Boundary Correspondence):** A system with a non-zero Chern number $C$ must host $|C|$ gapless, chiral edge states propagating along its boundary. The direction of propagation is determined by the sign of $C$. For $C=1$, there is one such state.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the System Using the Additivity of Hall Conductance\n\nThis approach treats the problem from the perspective of the bulk electronic transport properties.\n\n*   Let the first Chern insulator be System 1, with Chern number $C_1 = 1$. Its Hall conductance is $\\sigma_{xy,1} = 1 \\cdot \\frac{e^2}{h}$.\n*   Let the second Chern insulator be System 2, with Chern number $C_2 = 1$. Its Hall conductance is $\\sigma_{xy,2} = 1 \\cdot \\frac{e^2}{h}$.\n*   When these two systems are connected laterally, they form a wider conductor. From the perspective of electrical transport, they are connected in parallel.\n*   For conductors in parallel, their conductances add up. This principle applies to the Hall conductance as well.\n*   The total Hall conductance of the combined system ($\\sigma_{xy, \\text{total}}$) is the sum of the individual conductances:\n    $\\sigma_{xy, \\text{total}} = \\sigma_{xy,1} + \\sigma_{xy,2} = (C_1 + C_2) \\frac{e^2}{h}$\n*   Substituting the given values:\n    $\\sigma_{xy, \\text{total}} = (1 + 1) \\frac{e^2}{h} = 2 \\frac{e^2}{h}$\n*   The Chern number of the combined system ($C_{\\text{total}}$) is determined by its total Hall conductance: $\\sigma_{xy, \\text{total}} = C_{\\text{total}} \\frac{e^2}{h}$.\n*   By comparing the two expressions, we find that the Chern number of the combined system is $C_{\\text{total}} = 2$.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the System Using the Bulk-Boundary Correspondence\n\nThis approach provides a more intuitive picture by looking at the states on the boundaries.\n\n*   **Individual Systems:** Before joining, System 1 has one chiral edge state on its top boundary and one on its bottom boundary. System 2 also has one chiral edge state on its top and bottom boundaries.\n*   **Combined System:** Let's place System 2 to the right of System 1.\n    *   **Outer Boundary (Top):** The new top boundary is formed by the top edge of System 1 and the top edge of System 2. It will now host two co-propagating chiral edge states (one from each original system).\n    *   **Outer Boundary (Bottom):** Similarly, the new bottom boundary will host two co-propagating chiral edge states, moving in the opposite direction to the top ones.\n    *   **Internal Boundary (The Junction):** At the interface where the right edge of System 1 meets the left edge of System 2, we have a potential issue. The edge state from System 1 will be moving in one direction (e.g., down), while the edge state from System 2 will be moving in the opposite direction (e.g., up). Since the tunneling barrier is negligible, these two counter-propagating states will strongly couple, hybridize, and open an energy gap. This process is called \"gapping out\". These gapped states are no longer protected edge states and merge into the bulk spectrum. They do not contribute to the net transport around the perimeter of the *entire* system.\n*   **Conclusion from Edge States:** The topology of the combined system is determined by the net number of chiral states on its outermost boundary. We have established that there are two such states on the top edge and two on the bottom edge. Therefore, according to the bulk-boundary correspondence, the Chern number of the combined system is $C_{\\text{total}} = 2$.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n1.  **Additivity of Chern Number:** This problem is a direct application of the principle that topological charges, like the Chern number, are additive when systems are combined.\n2.  **Meaning of \"Junction\":** The question asks for the Chern number *of the junction*. This refers to the topological property of the new, single system formed by joining the two insulators, not a property localized at the interface line itself.\n3.  **Role of the Coupling:** The \"negligible tunneling barrier\" is crucial. It ensures the two systems become one, and it allows the internal counter-propagating edge states to gap each other out, which is essential for a consistent picture.\n\nBoth methods of analysis consistently lead to the same result.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe total Chern number of the system is the sum of the individual Chern numbers. Since each Chern insulator has a Chern number of 1, the Chern number of the junction formed by connecting them is $1 + 1 = 2$.\n\n<<<2>>>"
