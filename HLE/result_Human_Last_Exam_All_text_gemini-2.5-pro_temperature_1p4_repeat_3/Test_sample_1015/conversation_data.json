    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the differences between a cambré derrière in the Vaganova and Balanchine methods.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Movement - Cambré Derrière**\nA cambré is a bend of the body from the waist. \"Derrière\" is the French term for \"to the back.\" Therefore, a cambré derrière is a backbend. The movement should originate from the upper spine, with the head following the line of the back.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Vaganova Method's Approach**\nThe Vaganova method, developed in Russia by Agrippina Vaganova, is known for its precision, strength, and focus on clean, classical lines.\n*   **Key Principle:** Stability and alignment are paramount.\n*   **Execution:** When performing a cambré derrière, the Vaganova technique insists that the dancer's hips remain square and directly over the supporting legs/feet. The pelvis does not move forward.\n*   **Initiation:** The bend comes from the thoracic spine (upper/middle back). The dancer must maintain a strong core to support the lumbar spine (lower back) and prevent injury.\n*   **Resulting Aesthetic:** This creates a pure, controlled arc in the upper body while maintaining a stable base. The line is classical and emphasizes correct anatomical placement.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Balanchine Method's Approach**\nThe Balanchine method, developed by George Balanchine in America, is characterized by speed, musicality, and elongated, dynamic lines. It often pushes classical technique to its extremes.\n*   **Key Principle:** Creating dynamic, expansive shapes and lines.\n*   **Execution:** In a Balanchine cambré derrière, the dancer intentionally presses the hips and pelvis forward as the upper body bends backward.\n*   **Initiation:** While the back still arches, the forward thrust of the hips is a crucial component of the movement.\n*   **Resulting Aesthetic:** This forward hip placement allows for a much deeper and more dramatic C-curve shape throughout the entire body. It creates a visually striking, off-balance line that is a signature of the Balanchine style.\n\n**Step 4: Compare the Two and Evaluate the Answer Choices**\n\n*   **A. Arm placement during allongé:** The placement of the arms during the stretched portion of the movement (allongé) can have stylistic variations in both methods, but it is not the fundamental mechanical difference between them. The core distinction lies in the torso and pelvic action.\n*   **B. Placement of hip:** This is the primary and most significant point of divergence. Vaganova demands the hips stay stationary over the feet. Balanchine requires the hips to press forward. This is a defining technical difference that changes the entire execution and look of the step.\n*   **C. Speed:** While Balanchine's choreography is often faster, the tempo of a cambré is dictated by the music and the specific exercise. It is not an inherent rule that a Balanchine cambré is always faster than a Vaganova one.\n*   **D. Degree of backbend:** The Balanchine backbend is typically deeper, but this is a *result* of the hip placement. Pushing the hips forward allows for a greater arc. Therefore, the hip placement (B) is the cause, and the degree of the bend (D) is the effect. B is the more fundamental answer.\n*   **E. Placement of head:** In both techniques, the head follows the line of the spine. There may be subtle differences in the \"release\" of the head, but the fundamental principle is the same. It is not the core difference.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe most critical and defining difference between a cambré derrière in the Vaganova and Balanchine methods is the placement and action of the hips.\n\n<<<B>>>"
