    "Answering this question requires a step-by-step analysis of several key concepts in topology, particularly in the study of continua.\n\n### Step 1: Defining the Core Concepts\n\nFirst, we need to be precise about the terms used in the question.\n\n*   **Continuum:** A continuum is a compact, connected, Hausdorff space. The question explicitly states \"not necessarily metric,\" so we must use this general definition and cannot assume properties like separability or the existence of a countable base, which are specific to metric spaces.\n*   **Subcontinuum:** A subcontinuum of a space X is a subset of X that is also a continuum (i.e., it is compact and connected). A *proper* subcontinuum is one that is not equal to the entire space X.\n*   **Indecomposable Continuum:** A continuum X is called *indecomposable* if it cannot be expressed as the union of two of its proper subcontinua.\n*   **Composant:** For a point `p` in a continuum X, the *composant* of `p`, denoted `C(p)`, is the union of all proper subcontinua of X that contain the point `p`. Two composants are either identical or disjoint, and their union is the entire space X.\n\n### Step 2: The Relationship between Decomposability and Composants\n\nThere is a fundamental theorem that connects the number of composants to whether a continuum is decomposable or indecomposable.\n\n*   A continuum is *decomposable* if and only if it has exactly one composant. In a decomposable continuum, for any point `p`, the composant `C(p)` is the entire space X.\n*   Conversely, a continuum is *indecomposable* if and only if it has more than one composant. For an indecomposable continuum X, every composant `C(p)` is a proper subset of X.\n\nFrom this, we can immediately conclude that an indecomposable continuum must have at least **two** composants. The question asks for the smallest possible number, so we must investigate further.\n\n### Step 3: Using the Baire Category Theorem\n\nA powerful tool for analyzing continua is the Baire Category Theorem.\n\n*   **Baire Category Theorem:** In a compact Hausdorff space, the intersection of any countable collection of dense open sets is dense. An equivalent and more useful formulation for our purpose is that a compact Hausdorff space cannot be written as a countable union of nowhere-dense sets. Such spaces are said to be of the *second category*. Sets that can be written as a countable union of nowhere-dense sets are of the *first category*.\n\nNow, we apply this to the composants of an indecomposable continuum.\n\n1.  **Proper subcontinua are nowhere dense:** In an indecomposable continuum, any proper subcontinuum K must be nowhere dense. If it had a non-empty interior, the continuum could be decomposed into K and the closure of its complement, which contradicts indecomposability.\n2.  **Composants are of the first category:** A crucial (and non-trivial) theorem in continuum theory states that every composant of a continuum is a **sigma-compact** set. This means it can be written as a countable union of compact sets. In our case, a composant `C(p)` can be written as the union of a countable number of proper subcontinua: `C(p) = K_1 ∪ K_2 ∪ K_3 ∪ ...`.\n3.  Since each `K_i` is a proper subcontinuum of an indecomposable continuum, each `K_i` is nowhere dense (from point 1).\n4.  Therefore, each composant is a countable union of nowhere-dense sets, which by definition makes it a set of the **first category**.\n\n### Step 4: Finding a Lower Bound on the Number of Composants\n\nWe can now combine these facts to find a lower bound on the number of composants.\n\n*   Let X be an indecomposable continuum. It is the union of all its (disjoint) composants.\n*   Assume, for the sake of contradiction, that X has only a countable number of composants: `X = C_1 ∪ C_2 ∪ C_3 ∪ ...`.\n*   We just established that each composant `C_i` is a set of the first category.\n*   This would mean that X is a countable union of first-category sets. A countable union of first-category sets is itself a first-category set.\n*   However, X is a compact Hausdorff space, and by the Baire Category Theorem, it must be of the **second category**.\n*   This is a contradiction. Therefore, our initial assumption must be false.\n\nThe conclusion is that an indecomposable continuum cannot have a countable number of composants. It must have an **uncountable** number of them.\n\n### Step 5: Determining the Smallest Uncountable Number\n\nThe set of composants must be uncountable. The smallest uncountable cardinal number is **Aleph-one (ℵ₁)**. However, in topology, a stronger result is known.\n\n*   **Theorem:** Every non-degenerate indecomposable continuum has at least **`c`** (the cardinality of the continuum, i.e., `|ℝ| = 2^{ℵ₀}`) composants.\n\nThis is a classic but more advanced result in continuum theory. The proof typically involves constructing a continuous function (a Urysohn function) from the continuum to the interval `[0,1]` and showing that this forces the existence of at least `c` distinct composants.\n\nThis theorem establishes that **`c`** is a lower bound for the number of composants. To show it is the *smallest* possible number, we need to show that this minimum can be achieved.\n\n### Step 6: Existence of Continua with `c` Composants\n\nThere are many well-known examples of indecomposable continua that have exactly `c` composants. These include:\n\n*   The **dyadic solenoid**.\n*   The **bucket-handle continua** (or Knaster continua).\n*   The **pseudo-arc**.\n\nSince there exist indecomposable continua with exactly `c` composants, and we know from the theorem in Step 5 that any such continuum must have at least `c` composants, we can conclude that the smallest possible number is `c`.\n\nFinal conclusion: The smallest number of composants an indecomposable continuum can have is `c`, the cardinality of the continuum."
