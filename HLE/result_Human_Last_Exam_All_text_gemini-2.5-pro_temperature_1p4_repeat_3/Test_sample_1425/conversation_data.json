    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Grand Canonical Ensemble Partition Function**\n\nThe grand canonical ensemble describes a system in thermal and chemical equilibrium with a large reservoir. The system can exchange both energy and particles with the reservoir. The partition function, Z, in this ensemble is defined as the trace (Tr) over the entire Fock space (sum over all possible states, including those with different particle numbers) of the statistical operator:\n\n$Z = \\text{Tr} \\left[ e^{-\\beta (\\hat{H} - \\mu \\hat{N})} \\right]$\n\nwhere:\n*   `H_hat` is the Hamiltonian operator of the system.\n*   `N_hat` is the particle number operator.\n*   `μ` is the chemical potential, which is a parameter set by the reservoir.\n*   `β = 1 / (k_B T)`, where `T` is the temperature and `k_B` is the Boltzmann constant.\n*   `Tr[...]` denotes the trace over all states in the Hilbert space.\n\n**Step 2: Substitute the Given Hamiltonian**\n\nThe problem provides a specific, simple Hamiltonian:\n$\\hat{H} = -\\mu \\hat{N}$\n\nWe substitute this into the general expression for the grand canonical partition function:\n\n$Z = \\text{Tr} \\left[ e^{-\\beta ((-\\mu \\hat{N}) - \\mu \\hat{N})} \\right]$\n\nSimplifying the term in the exponent:\n\n$-\\beta (-\\mu \\hat{N} - \\mu \\hat{N}) = -\\beta (-2\\mu \\hat{N}) = 2\\beta\\mu \\hat{N}$\n\nSo, the partition function becomes:\n\n$Z = \\text{Tr} \\left[ e^{2\\beta\\mu \\hat{N}} \\right]$\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the Trace**\n\nTo evaluate the trace, we sum the diagonal matrix elements over a complete basis. The most convenient basis is the Fock space basis, which consists of states with a definite particle number `N`, denoted as `|N>`. The number operator `N_hat` is diagonal in this basis: `N_hat|N> = N|N>`.\n\nThe trace can be written as a sum over all possible particle numbers `N` from 0 to infinity:\n\n$Z = \\sum_{N=0}^{\\infty} \\langle N | e^{2\\beta\\mu \\hat{N}} | N \\rangle \\cdot g(N)$\n\nwhere `g(N)` is the degeneracy, i.e., the number of distinct quantum states for a given particle number `N`.\n\nSince `N_hat` is diagonal, the exponential operator is also diagonal:\n$e^{2\\beta\\mu \\hat{N}} | N \\rangle = e^{2\\beta\\mu N} | N \\rangle$\n\nSubstituting this into the trace expression:\n\n$Z = \\sum_{N=0}^{\\infty} \\langle N | e^{2\\beta\\mu N} | N \\rangle \\cdot g(N) = \\sum_{N=0}^{\\infty} e^{2\\beta\\mu N} \\langle N | N \\rangle \\cdot g(N)$\n\nAssuming the basis states are normalized (`<N|N> = 1`), we get:\n\n$Z = \\sum_{N=0}^{\\infty} g(N) \\left( e^{2\\beta\\mu} \\right)^N$\n\n**Step 4: A Careful Point - Determining the Degeneracy g(N)**\n\nThe provided Hamiltonian `H_hat = -μN_hat` contains no information about the kinetic energy of particles or the states they can occupy. This introduces an ambiguity in `g(N)`. We must make a reasonable assumption based on the context. The request to use path integrals suggests a quantum field theory context. The simplest model in this context is that of identical, non-interacting particles occupying a single quantum state.\n\n*   **Assumption (Bosons):** If the particles are bosons, any number of them can occupy the single state. Thus, for any particle number `N`, there is exactly one possible state. This means the degeneracy `g(N) = 1` for all `N ≥ 0`. This is the most common and standard assumption in such problems unless specified otherwise.\n*   **Alternative (Fermions):** If the particles were fermions, the Pauli exclusion principle would allow only 0 or 1 particle in the single state. Then `g(0)=1`, `g(1)=1`, and `g(N)=0` for `N>1`.\n\nWe will proceed assuming the particles are **bosons**, as this is standard for introductory path integral problems.\n\n**Step 5: Calculation of the Partition Function (assuming Bosons)**\n\nWith `g(N) = 1`, the partition function becomes:\n\n$Z = \\sum_{N=0}^{\\infty} \\left( e^{2\\beta\\mu} \\right)^N$\n\nThis is a geometric series of the form $\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} x^n$, where $x = e^{2\\beta\\mu}$.\n\n*   **Convergence Condition:** A geometric series converges if and only if the absolute value of the ratio `x` is less than 1.\n    $|x| < 1 \\implies |e^{2\\beta\\mu}| < 1$\n    Since `β` and the exponential function are always positive, this simplifies to:\n    $e^{2\\beta\\mu} < 1$\n    Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    $\\ln(e^{2\\beta\\mu}) < \\ln(1) \\implies 2\\beta\\mu < 0$\n    Since `β > 0` (as absolute temperature `T` is positive), this requires `μ < 0`.\n\n*   **Result of Summation:** If the condition `μ < 0` is met, the series converges to `1 / (1 - x)`.\n    $Z = \\frac{1}{1 - e^{2\\beta\\mu}}$\n\nIf `μ ≥ 0`, the series diverges, meaning the partition function is infinite (`Z = ∞`). This makes physical sense: if `μ ≥ 0`, the grand canonical potential `H - μN = -2μN` is non-positive, meaning the system can lower its \"energy\" by indefinitely accumulating particles from the reservoir, leading to an unstable system.\n\n**Step 6: Justification via Path Integral Formalism**\n\nThe question asks to use path integrals. We can justify our result by mapping our specific problem onto a standard system whose path integral result is well-known.\n\nThe path integral for a single non-interacting bosonic mode with single-particle energy `ε` and chemical potential `μ'` yields the partition function:\n$Z_{\\text{std}} = \\frac{1}{1 - e^{-\\beta(\\epsilon - \\mu')}}$\n\nOur problem has the partition function $Z = \\text{Tr}[e^{2\\beta\\mu\\hat{N}}]$. We can write the exponent as $2\\beta\\mu\\hat{N} = -\\beta(-\\frac{2\\mu}{1}\\hat{N})$.\nLet's compare this to the exponent of the standard system: $-\\beta(\\epsilon - \\mu')\\hat{N}$.\n\nTo match the two forms, we can set:\n*   The single-particle energy `ε = 0` (as there is no kinetic term in our Hamiltonian).\n*   The effective chemical potential `μ' = 2μ`.\n\nSubstituting these effective values into the standard path integral result:\n\n$Z = \\frac{1}{1 - e^{-\\beta(0 - 2\\mu)}} = \\frac{1}{1 - e^{2\\beta\\mu}}$\n\nThis result perfectly matches the one obtained from the direct summation. The convergence condition `μ < 0` is also recovered, as the argument of the exponent in the standard formula, `-β(ε-μ')`, must be negative for the underlying geometric series to converge. For our case, this means `-β(0-2μ) = 2βμ` must be negative, which implies `μ<0`.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe partition function Z for the system, assuming bosonic statistics and for the system to be stable, is given by the sum of a geometric series. The calculation yields:\n\n$Z = \\sum_{N=0}^{\\infty} e^{2\\beta\\mu N} = \\frac{1}{1 - e^{2\\beta\\mu}}$\n\nThis result is valid under the convergence condition that the chemical potential `μ` is negative (`μ < 0`). If `μ ≥ 0`, the partition function diverges.\n\n<<<1 / (1 - exp(2*β*μ))>>>"
