    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the oligomeric state of the given protein sequence.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Heptad Repeat**\n\nCoiled-coils are formed by alpha-helices that have a characteristic repeating pattern of seven amino acids, known as a heptad repeat. This pattern is labeled (abcdefg)n. The most important positions for determining the structure are the 'a' and 'd' positions, which are typically occupied by hydrophobic amino acids. These residues form the hydrophobic core that holds the helices together.\n\nThe given sequence is: `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG`\n\nWe need to find the (abcdefg)n pattern. Let's look for a repeating motif where hydrophobic residues (like I, L, A, V, W) are at the 'a' and 'd' positions. A key feature is that the 'a' and 'd' positions are separated by two other amino acids (b and c).\n\nLet's test possible alignments:\n*   If `I` (at position 3) is 'a', then `S` (at position 6) would be 'd'. Serine (S) is polar, so this is incorrect.\n*   Let's try aligning `A` (at position 4) to the 'a' position. Then, three residues later, `L` (at position 7) would be the 'd' position. Both Alanine (A) and Leucine (L) are hydrophobic. This is a very promising alignment.\n\nLet's assign the entire sequence based on `A` at position 4 being 'a'. We can ignore the flanking residues (G, E, I at the start and K, G at the end) that don't fit the repeating pattern.\n\nThe repeating coiled-coil region is: `A(4)QSLKEI A(11)KSLKEI A(18)WSLKEI A(25)QSLK`\n\nLet's write out the residues at each position of the heptad repeat for the ~3.5 repeats present:\n*   **Position 'a'**: A, A, A, A (Alanine)\n*   **Position 'b'**: Q, K, W, Q\n*   **Position 'c'**: S, S, S, S\n*   **Position 'd'**: L, L, L, L (Leucine)\n*   **Position 'e'**: K, K, K, K\n*   **Position 'f'**: E, E, E\n*   **Position 'g'**: I, I, I\n\nThis alignment is consistent and places hydrophobic residues at the critical 'a' and 'd' core positions.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the \"Knobs-into-Holes\" Packing**\n\nThe oligomeric state (the number of helices in the bundle, e.g., dimer, trimer) is determined by how efficiently the side chains from the 'a' and 'd' positions can pack together in the hydrophobic core. This is called \"knobs-into-holes\" packing, where a side chain (\"knob\") from one helix fits into a space (\"hole\") created by side chains on an adjacent helix.\n\nThe size of the amino acids at the 'a' and 'd' positions is the critical factor.\n*   **Our sequence has:**\n    *   **Position 'a'**: Alanine (A), which has a **small** methyl side chain.\n    *   **Position 'd'**: Leucine (L), which has a **large**, bulky isobutyl side chain.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the packing for different oligomeric states:\n*   **Dimer (2 helices)**: A dimer could form, but the packing of small Alanines opposite each other and large Leucines opposite each other is not as geometrically ideal as some other combinations.\n*   **Trimer (3 helices)**: This structure is highly favored by the a=A, d=L pattern. In a trimer, the core consists of two layers: one formed by the three 'a' residues and one by the three 'd' residues.\n    *   The layer of small Alanines allows the three helices to come very close to each other.\n    *   The layer of large Leucines then packs perfectly into the larger space created at the 'd' position layer. This creates a highly stable, tightly packed hydrophobic core with no empty space (under-packing) and no steric clashes (over-packing). This specific a=A, d=L pattern is a classic signature for a trimeric coiled-coil.\n*   **Tetramer (4 helices)**: This state is less likely. A layer of four large Leucines at the 'd' positions would likely be too crowded, causing steric clashes (over-packing). Conversely, the layer of four small Alanines at the 'a' positions would be too small to fill the core, leaving an energetically unfavorable hole or cavity (under-packing).\n*   **Pentamer (5 helices) and higher**: These are highly unfavorable. Stable pentamers typically have the opposite pattern: a large residue at 'a' (like L or I) and a small residue at 'd' (like A). The pattern in our sequence (a=A, d=L) would lead to severe over-packing at the 'd' position layer and severe under-packing at the 'a' position layer for a pentamer or any higher-order oligomer.\n\n**Step 3: Conclusion**\n\nBased on the principles of knobs-into-holes packing and side-chain volume, the combination of a small residue (Alanine) at the 'a' positions and a large residue (Leucine) at the 'd' positions creates the most stable and efficient hydrophobic core for a **trimer**.\n\n<<<B>>>"
