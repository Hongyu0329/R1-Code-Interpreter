    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the oligomeric state of the given coiled-coil protein sequences.\n\n### **Analytical Framework**\n\nThe oligomeric state of a coiled-coil protein is primarily dictated by the identity and pattern of amino acids at the core positions of the heptad repeat, denoted as 'a' and 'd'. The general structure of a heptad repeat is `(abcdefg)n`.\n\n1.  **Core Positions ('a' and 'd'):** These are typically hydrophobic residues. Their size, shape, and polarity are the main determinants of whether the helices will pack as a dimer, trimer, tetramer, or higher-order oligomer.\n2.  **Solvent-Exposed Positions ('b', 'c', 'f'):** These are usually hydrophilic residues.\n3.  **Inter-helical Interaction Positions ('e' and 'g'):** These are often charged or polar residues that can form stabilizing electrostatic interactions (salt bridges) or hydrogen bonds between adjacent helices.\n\n**The key to solving this problem is to correctly identify the heptad repeat register for each sequence.** This means figuring out which amino acid corresponds to the 'a' position. Once the register is set, we can analyze the residues at the 'a' and 'd' positions to predict the oligomeric state based on established principles.\n\n*   **Dimer:** Often favored by alternating large and small hydrophobic residues, or by polar residues like Asparagine (N) at 'a' positions which form specific H-bonds.\n*   **Trimer:** Often favored by specific packing arrangements like `a=I, d=L/A` or `a=L/A, d=I`. Polar residues like Glutamine (Q) in the core can also drive trimerization.\n*   **Tetramer:** Often favored when both 'a' and 'd' are bulky hydrophobic residues like `I` or `L`, or when specific polar networks (e.g., from Threonine, T) can be formed.\n\n---\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis of Each Sequence**\n\n**Sequence 1: `EIAQALKEIAKALKEIAWALKEIAQALK`**\n\n1.  **Register Identification:** Let's test the register where the first residue 'E' is at the 'g' position (`gabcdef`). This is a common starting point for designed coiled-coils.\n    *   `g a b c d e f`\n    *   `E I A Q A L K`\n2.  **Core Residue Analysis:**\n    *   'a' positions: I, I, I, I\n    *   'd' positions: A, A, W, A (A=Alanine, W=Tryptophan)\n3.  **Oligomeric State Prediction:** The core is predominantly composed of Isoleucine (I) at 'a' and Alanine (A) at 'd'. This `a=I, d=A` packing motif, where a \"knob\" (Ile) fits into a \"hole\" created by smaller residues (Ala), is a classic signature for a **Trimer**. The single large W residue does not disrupt this overall propensity.\n4.  **Result:** **Trimer (3)**\n\n**Sequence 2: `EIAALKQEIAALKKENAALKQEIAALKQ`**\n\n1.  **Register Identification:** Using the same 'g' register as for sequence 1.\n    *   The sequence contains a `...K E N A A...` segment. Assigning 'E' to the 'g' position places 'N' (Asparagine) at the 'a' position in the third heptad.\n2.  **Core Residue Analysis:**\n    *   'a' positions: I, I, N, I\n    *   'd' positions: A, A, A, A\n3.  **Oligomeric State Prediction:** The presence of an Asparagine (N) residue at an 'a' core position is a very strong determinant for dimerization. The polar side chain of Asn forms a specific hydrogen bond with its counterpart on the adjacent helix, stabilizing a parallel two-stranded coiled-coil and preventing the formation of higher-order oligomers.\n4.  **Result:** **Dimer (2)**\n\n**Sequence 3: `EIAAIKQEIAAIKKEIAAIKWEIAAIKQ`**\n\n1.  **Register Identification:** If we use the 'g' register, we get a core of `a=I, d=I`, which is a canonical tetramer. However, let's test another register, as this can vary. Let's try the 'e' register (`efgabcd`), where the first heptad would be `AAIKQEI`.\n2.  **Core Residue Analysis ('e' register):**\n    *   'a' positions: A, A, A, A (with one `W` substitution in the third heptad, `EIAAIK**W**EIA...`) -- wait, let's re-check `e f g a b c d`. `E I A A I K Q`. This gives `a=A`, `d=I`.\n    *   `e` register `(EI)AAIKQE...`\n        * Heptad 1: `AAIKQEI` -> a=A, d=I\n        * Heptad 2: `AAIKKEI` -> a=A, d=I\n        * Heptad 3: `AAIKWEI` -> a=A, d=W\n        * Heptad 4: `AAIKQEI` -> a=A, d=I\n    * The core is `a=A/W, d=I`.\n3.  **Oligomeric State Prediction:** This `a=A, d=I` core is the reverse of the one in sequence 1. It still involves a small residue (Ala) and a bulky, branched one (Ile). This type of packing is also highly favorable for a **Trimer**.\n4.  **Result:** **Trimer (3)**\n\n**Sequence 4: `EIQKQLKEIQKQLKEIQWQLKEIQKQLK`**\n\n1.  **Register Identification:** The 'g' register would place a charged Lysine (K) in the core 'd' position, which is highly unfavorable. Let's test the 'e' register (`efgabcd`).\n2.  **Core Residue Analysis ('e' register):**\n    *   The sequence breaks down into heptads like `QKQLKEI`.\n    *   `e f g a b c d`\n    *   `E I Q K Q L K` -> `a=Q`, `d=L`\n    *   'a' positions: Q, Q, W, Q (Q=Glutamine)\n    *   'd' positions: L, L, L, L (L=Leucine)\n3.  **Oligomeric State Prediction:** The core is `a=Q, d=L`. Glutamine is a polar residue, but it can be accommodated in the hydrophobic core where it forms a network of inter-helical hydrogen bonds. The `a=Q, d=L` motif is known to specifically promote the formation of a **Trimer**.\n4.  **Result:** **Trimer (3)**\n\n**Sequence 5: `EIAQTLKEIAKTLKEIAWTLKEIAQTLK`**\n\n1.  **Register Identification:** Similar to the previous sequence, the 'g' register would place polar/charged residues (Q, K) at the 'd' positions. Let's test the 'e' register (`efgabcd`).\n2.  **Core Residue Analysis ('e' register):**\n    *   The sequence breaks into heptads like `AQTLKEI`.\n    *   `e f g a b c d`\n    *   `E I A Q T L K` -> `a=A`, `d=T`\n    *   'a' positions: A, A, A, A\n    *   'd' positions: T, T, T, T (T=Threonine)\n3.  **Oligomeric State Prediction:** The core is `a=A, d=T`. Threonine is a polar, beta-branched amino acid. When placed at the 'd' position across from a small 'a' residue like Alanine, the threonine side chains can form a stabilizing hydrogen-bond network within the core. This specific arrangement strongly favors the formation of a parallel **Tetramer**.\n4.  **Result:** **Tetramer (4)**\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nCombining the results from the analysis:\n*   Sequence 1: Trimer (3)\n*   Sequence 2: Dimer (2)\n*   Sequence 3: Trimer (3)\n*   Sequence 4: Trimer (3)\n*   Sequence 5: Tetramer (4)\n\nThe resulting oligomeric states are **3, 2, 3, 3, 4**. This corresponds to answer choice E.\n\n<<<E>>>"
