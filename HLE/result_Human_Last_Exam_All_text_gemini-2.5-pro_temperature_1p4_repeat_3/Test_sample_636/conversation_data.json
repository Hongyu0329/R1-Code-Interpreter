    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the state feedback gain matrix F.\n\n**1. Define the System and the Goal**\n\nWe are given the state-space representation of a linear system:\n*   State matrix: `A = [-1, 1; 1, 0]`\n*   Input matrix: `B = [1, 2; 1, 0]`\n\nThe goal is to find a state feedback gain matrix `F` such that the closed-loop system `A_cl = A - BF` has eigenvalues at `-1 + j` and `-1 - j`.\n\n**2. Determine the Desired Characteristic Polynomial**\n\nThe desired eigenvalues are a complex conjugate pair: `λ₁ = -1 + j` and `λ₂ = -1 - j`. The characteristic polynomial for a system with these eigenvalues is:\n`p_d(s) = (s - λ₁)(s - λ₂)`\n`p_d(s) = (s - (-1 + j))(s - (-1 - j))`\n`p_d(s) = ((s + 1) - j)((s + 1) + j)`\nUsing the identity `(x - y)(x + y) = x² - y²`, we get:\n`p_d(s) = (s + 1)² - j²`\nSince `j² = -1`:\n`p_d(s) = (s² + 2s + 1) - (-1)`\n`p_d(s) = s² + 2s + 2`\nThis is our target characteristic polynomial for the closed-loop system.\n\n**3. Address the Multi-Input Nature of the System**\n\nThe system has two states (`n=2`, size of A) and two inputs (`m=2`, columns of B). The gain matrix `F` will be a 2x2 matrix:\n`F = [f11, f12; f21, f22]`\n\nSince there are four unknowns in `F` but only two constraints (to place the two poles), the problem is underdetermined, meaning there are infinitely many solutions for `F`. A common strategy is to find a simple solution by simplifying the structure of `F`.\n\n**4. Simplify the Problem**\n\nLet's assume we can achieve the goal using only the first input, which means the second input `u₂` is always zero. This is equivalent to setting the second row of the gain matrix `F` to zero.\nLet `F = [f1, f2; 0, 0]`.\n\n*   **Careful Point**: This simplification is only valid if the system is controllable using only the first input. Let's check the controllability of the pair `(A, b₁)` where `b₁` is the first column of `B`, i.e., `b₁ = [1; 1]`.\n    *   The controllability matrix is `C₁ = [b₁, A*b₁]`.\n    *   `A*b₁ = [-1, 1; 1, 0] * [1; 1] = [0; 1]`\n    *   `C₁ = [1, 0; 1, 1]`\n    *   `det(C₁) = 1*1 - 0*1 = 1 ≠ 0`. Since the determinant is non-zero, the system `(A, b₁)` is controllable, and our simplification is valid.\n\n**5. Formulate the Closed-Loop System**\n\nNow we calculate the closed-loop matrix `A_cl = A - BF` with our simplified `F`.\n*   `BF = [1, 2; 1, 0] * [f1, f2; 0, 0] = [(1*f1 + 2*0), (1*f2 + 2*0); (1*f1 + 0*0), (1*f2 + 0*0)] = [f1, f2; f1, f2]`\n*   `A_cl = A - BF = [-1, 1; 1, 0] - [f1, f2; f1, f2] = [-1-f1, 1-f2; 1-f1, -f2]`\n\n**6. Calculate the Characteristic Polynomial of the Closed-Loop System**\n\nThe characteristic polynomial of `A_cl` is `p_cl(s) = det(sI - A_cl)`.\n*   `sI - A_cl = [s, 0; 0, s] - [-1-f1, 1-f2; 1-f1, -f2] = [s + 1 + f1, -(1 - f2); -(1 - f1), s - (-f2)] = [s + 1 + f1, f2 - 1; f1 - 1, s + f2]`\n*   `det(sI - A_cl) = (s + 1 + f1)(s + f2) - (f2 - 1)(f1 - 1)`\n    `= s² + s*f2 + s(1 + f1) + f2(1 + f1) - (f1*f2 - f2 - f1 + 1)`\n    `= s² + s(f1 + f2 + 1) + (f2 + f1*f2) - (f1*f2 - f1 - f2 + 1)`\n    `= s² + s(f1 + f2 + 1) + f2 + f1*f2 - f1*f2 + f1 + f2 - 1`\n    `= s² + s(f1 + f2 + 1) + (f1 + 2*f2 - 1)`\n\n**7. Equate Coefficients and Solve for F**\n\nNow we equate the coefficients of our calculated polynomial `p_cl(s)` with the desired polynomial `p_d(s) = s² + 2s + 2`.\n\n*   Comparing `s¹` coefficients: `f1 + f2 + 1 = 2`  => `f1 + f2 = 1`  (Equation 1)\n*   Comparing `s⁰` (constant) coefficients: `f1 + 2*f2 - 1 = 2` => `f1 + 2*f2 = 3` (Equation 2)\n\nWe now have a system of two linear equations for `f1` and `f2`.\nSubtracting Equation 1 from Equation 2:\n`(f1 + 2*f2) - (f1 + f2) = 3 - 1`\n`f2 = 2`\n\nSubstitute `f2 = 2` back into Equation 1:\n`f1 + 2 = 1`\n`f1 = -1`\n\nSo, we have found `f1 = -1` and `f2 = 2`.\n\n**8. Final Answer Construction**\n\nSubstituting these values back into our simplified structure for `F`:\n`F = [f1, f2; 0, 0] = [-1, 2; 0, 0]`\n\nThis is one possible solution for the state feedback gain `F`. Other solutions exist, but this one is correct and derived through a standard method.\n\n<<<[[-1, 2], [0, 0]]>>>"
