    "### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The question asks for a specific philosopher from a particular school of thought who made a specific philosophical distinction.\n    *   **Philosophical School:** Lviv-Warsaw School. This was a highly influential school of logic and analytic philosophy in Poland during the interwar period. Key figures include Kazimierz Twardowski, Jan Łukasiewicz, Stanisław Leśniewski, Alfred Tarski, and Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz.\n    *   **Concept:** The decomposition of the notion of \"hallmark\" (or \"mark\", \"sign\").\n    *   **Distinction:** The hallmark is broken down into two types: \"symptoms\" and \"signals\".\n\n2.  **Identify the Philosopher:** We need to search within the works and doctrines of the major figures of the Lviv-Warsaw School to find who made this specific distinction. This analysis falls under the fields of semiotics (the study of signs) and philosophy of language.\n\n3.  **Investigate the Distinction:** Research into the semiotic theories of the Lviv-Warsaw school points directly to one philosopher.\n    *   **Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz** is renowned for his work in logic, epistemology, and the philosophy of language. A central part of his analysis of signs and meaning involves the distinction between different types of signs.\n\n4.  **Define the Terms as Used by the Philosopher:**\n    *   **Hallmark (or Mark/Sign):** This is the general category for something that indicates the presence of something else.\n    *   **Symptom (Polish: *objaw*):** This is a *natural* sign. The relationship between the symptom and what it indicates is based on a natural, causal law. It is a hallmark *of* something.\n        *   **Careful Point:** The connection is not based on human convention or intention. For example, smoke is a symptom of fire because fire causally produces smoke. A fever is a symptom of an illness.\n    *   **Signal (Polish: *sygnał*):** This is a *conventional* or *artificial* sign. The relationship between the signal and what it signifies is established by a rule, an agreement, or an intention to communicate. It is a hallmark *for* something.\n        *   **Careful Point:** The connection is created by humans. For example, a green traffic light is a signal to proceed. The word \"cat\" is a signal that refers to the animal. Someone uses a signal with a purpose.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The philosopher from the Lviv-Warsaw School who introduced the formal distinction between symptoms (natural signs) and signals (conventional signs) as two types of hallmarks is **Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz**. This was a significant contribution to his theory of signs and language.\n\n### Final Answer\n<<<Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz>>>"
