    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Reactants and Reaction Type**\n*   **Substrate:** (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane. This is a secondary alkyl halide on a cyclohexane ring. The specific stereochemistry is important.\n*   **Reagent/Solvent System:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK) in tert-butyl alcohol (t-BuOH). Potassium tert-butoxide is a strong, sterically bulky (hindered) base.\n*   **Reaction Type:** The combination of a secondary alkyl halide with a strong, bulky base strongly favors an **E2 (bimolecular elimination)** reaction. The bulky nature of the base will disfavor any substitution (SN2) reactions.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Stereochemical Requirement of the E2 Reaction**\n*   The E2 mechanism has a strict stereochemical requirement: the leaving group (in this case, Br) and the beta-hydrogen (a hydrogen on an adjacent carbon) must be in an **anti-periplanar** conformation.\n*   In a cyclohexane chair conformation, this anti-periplanar arrangement means the leaving group and the beta-hydrogen must both be in **axial** positions and on opposite sides of the ring (one pointing up, one pointing down). This is known as a **trans-diaxial** arrangement.\n\n**Step 3: Draw the Chair Conformations of the Substrate**\n*   We need to draw the two possible chair conformations for (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane and identify which one can undergo the E2 reaction.\n    *   **Conformation A (Br axial, CH₃ equatorial):** Let's place the Br group in an axial position on C1. For the stereochemistry to be (1S, 2R), the CH₃ group on C2 must be in the equatorial position. This conformation is relatively stable because the bulky methyl group is in the less crowded equatorial position.\n    *   **Conformation B (Br equatorial, CH₃ axial):** A ring flip of Conformation A gives Conformation B. Here, the Br group is equatorial and the CH₃ group is axial. This conformation is less stable due to the steric strain of having the bulky methyl group in an axial position.\n\n*   The E2 reaction can only proceed from the conformation where the leaving group (Br) is axial. Therefore, the reaction must occur via **Conformation A**.\n\n**Step 4: Identify Possible Elimination Pathways from the Reactive Conformation**\n*   In Conformation A, the Bromine on C1 is axial. We need to find beta-hydrogens that are also axial. The beta-carbons are C2 and C6.\n    *   **At C2:** The methyl group is equatorial, so the hydrogen on C2 is **axial**. This axial hydrogen is trans-diaxial to the axial bromine. Elimination of this H is possible.\n    *   **At C6:** This carbon has two hydrogens, one axial and one equatorial. The **axial** hydrogen on C6 is trans-diaxial to the axial bromine. Elimination of this H is also possible.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the Products and Apply Regioselectivity Rules**\n*   We have two possible elimination pathways, leading to two different products (constitutional isomers):\n    1.  **Zaitsev Pathway:** Removing the axial H from C2 gives a double bond between C1 and C2. The product is **1-methylcyclohexene**. This is a **trisubstituted** alkene (the carbons of the double bond are attached to three other carbon atoms), making it the more thermodynamically stable product.\n    2.  **Hofmann Pathway:** Removing the axial H from C6 gives a double bond between C1 and C6. The product is **3-methylcyclohexene**. This is a **disubstituted** alkene (the carbons of the double bond are attached to two other carbon atoms), making it the less thermodynamically stable product.\n\n*   **Regioselectivity Rule:** The choice between the Zaitsev and Hofmann product depends on the base.\n    *   Small, strong bases (like ethoxide) favor the more stable Zaitsev product.\n    *   Large, bulky bases (like **tert-butoxide**) are sterically hindered. They preferentially attack the less sterically hindered proton, leading to the **Hofmann product** as the major product.\n*   In our case, the axial proton on C6 is more sterically accessible than the axial proton on C2 (which is closer to the equatorial methyl group). Therefore, the bulky tert-butoxide base will preferentially remove the proton from C6.\n\n**Step 6: Final Conclusion**\nThe reaction proceeds via an E2 mechanism from the chair conformation where Br is axial. The bulky base, potassium tert-butoxide, preferentially abstracts the more accessible axial proton on C6, leading to the formation of the less substituted alkene (Hofmann product). The name of this major product is 3-methylcyclohexene.\n\n<<<3-methylcyclohexene>>>"
