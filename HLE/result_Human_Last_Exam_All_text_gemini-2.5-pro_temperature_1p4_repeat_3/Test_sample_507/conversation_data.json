    "This question requires finding two languages that meet three specific and challenging criteria. Let's break down the analysis step-by-step.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Deconstructing the Question's Constraints**\n\nThe question asks for two languages that satisfy the following conditions simultaneously:\n1.  **Origin:** They must be from two different cultures in Asia.\n2.  **Contact:** The cultures should have had \"no direct contact.\"\n3.  **Lexicon:** The words for \"broom,\" \"mom,\" and \"dad\" must be nearly identical or highly similar.\n\n**Step 2: Listing Careful Points and Method**\n\n1.  **\"No Direct Contact\":** This is a critical and nuanced constraint. It implies the languages should not have a history of significant, sustained cultural exchange, trade, or political influence that would lead to borrowing core vocabulary. The safest way to ensure this is to choose languages from entirely different language families and distant geographical regions of Asia (e.g., East Asia vs. South Asia).\n\n2.  **\"Mom\" and \"Dad\":** These words are a potential trap. Words for \"mother\" and \"father\" across many unrelated languages are often coincidentally similar (e.g., *mama*, *amma*, *baba*, *papa*, *appa*). This phenomenon occurs because these words are often \"nursery words,\" derived from the simple consonant-vowel sounds that babies first learn to make (/m/, /p/, /b/, /d/, /a/). While their similarity is notable, it's not strong evidence of a connection on its own.\n\n3.  **\"Broom\":** This is the key to solving the puzzle. Unlike \"mom\" and \"dad,\" \"broom\" is a specific noun for a household tool. A strong phonetic similarity in this word between two unrelated languages would be a much rarer and more significant coincidence. Therefore, the search should prioritize finding a match for \"broom.\"\n\n**Step 3: Investigating Candidate Language Pairs**\n\nLet's test some pairs based on the \"no direct contact\" rule.\n\n*   **Pair A: Tagalog (Philippines) and Turkish (Turkey/West Asia)**\n    *   Contact: None. Families (Austronesian vs. Turkic) are unrelated.\n    *   Mom: Tagalog *ina* vs. Turkish *anne*. (Not similar).\n    *   Dad: Tagalog *ama* vs. Turkish *baba*. (Weak similarity).\n    *   Broom: Tagalog *walis* vs. Turkish *süpürge*. (Not similar).\n    *   *Result: This pair fails.*\n\n*   **Pair B: Japanese (Japan) and Hindi (India)**\n    *   Contact: Indirect, but no sustained direct cultural exchange. Families (Japonic vs. Indo-Aryan) are unrelated.\n    *   Mom: Japanese *haha* vs. Hindi *mā*. (Weak similarity).\n    *   Dad: Japanese *chichi* vs. Hindi *pitā*. (Not similar).\n    *   Broom: Japanese *hōki* vs. Hindi *jhaṛu*. (Not similar).\n    *   *Result: This pair fails.*\n\n**Step 4: Focusing on the Strongest Similarities**\n\nThe most striking similarities for \"mom\" and \"dad\" in Asia exist between Korean and the Dravidian languages of Southern India, such as Tamil.\n\n*   **Candidate Pair: Korean and Tamil**\n    *   **Cultures and Contact:** Korean is spoken in East Asia and belongs to the Koreanic language family. Tamil is spoken in South India and Sri Lanka and belongs to the Dravidian family. There is no mainstream historical evidence of direct, sustained contact between these two cultures that would explain borrowing of core family terms. This pair perfectly fits the \"no direct contact\" rule.\n\n    *   **Word Comparison:**\n        *   **Mom:** The word for \"mom\" in Korean is **eomma (엄마)**. In Tamil, it is **amma (அம்மா)**. These are phonetically and structurally almost identical.\n        *   **Dad:** The word for \"dad\" in Korean is **appa (아빠)**. In Tamil, it is also **appa (அப்பா)**. These are identical.\n\n    *   This gives us an exceptionally strong match for two of the three words and the non-contact rule. Now, let's check the crucial third word.\n\n        *   **Broom:** The word for \"broom\" in Korean is **bitjaru (빗자루)**. The word for \"broom\" in Tamil is **thudappam (துடைப்பம்)**.\n\n    *   **Analysis:** *Bitjaru* and *thudappam* are not similar in sound or structure.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion and Acquiring the Answer**\n\nWhile no language pair appears to perfectly match all three word criteria based on standard linguistic data, the question likely refers to a famous case of linguistic coincidence. The resemblance between Korean and Tamil kinship terms is the most remarkable and widely noted example of this type in Asia.\n\n*   **Korean:** Mom (eomma), Dad (appa)\n*   **Tamil:** Mom (amma), Dad (appa)\n\nThe similarities for \"mom\" and \"dad\" are so striking that this pair is almost certainly the intended answer, despite the word \"broom\" not matching. It is possible the original question is flawed, exaggerated, or refers to an obscure dialectal word. However, given the options, the Korean-Tamil pair is the only one that presents a truly \"nearly identical\" match for two out of the three words while perfectly satisfying the \"no direct contact\" condition.\n\nTherefore, the languages are Korean and Tamil.\n\n<<<Korean and Tamil>>>"
