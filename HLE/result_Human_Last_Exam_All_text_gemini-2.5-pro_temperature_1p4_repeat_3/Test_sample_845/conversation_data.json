    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Context:** Tracking Heart Rate (HR) and Heart Rate Variability (HRV).\n    *   **Method:** Using Photoplethysmography (PPG) to capture \"beat-to-beat intervals\".\n    *   **Core Inquiry:** HRV is computed from a \"value between heartbeats\". The question is: \"What is that value called?\"\n\n2.  **Understand the Physiology and Measurement:**\n    *   Your heart does not beat with perfect regularity like a metronome. The time between each consecutive heartbeat varies slightly.\n    *   **Heart Rate (HR)** is the average number of beats in a minute (BPM).\n    *   **Heart Rate Variability (HRV)** is the measurement of this *variation* in time between successive heartbeats.\n    *   To calculate HRV, you first need to measure the precise time elapsed from one beat to the next. This raw measurement is the \"value\" the question is asking about.\n\n3.  **Identify the Technical Term for the \"Value Between Heartbeats\":**\n    *   This time duration is a fundamental measurement, typically recorded in milliseconds (ms).\n    *   There are several specific technical terms for this interval, depending on the measurement technology used.\n\n### Careful Points and Terminology\n\n*   **Point 1: The Gold Standard (ECG):** The clinical gold standard for measuring this interval is an electrocardiogram (ECG). On an ECG waveform, the most prominent spike is the \"R-wave\". The time from one R-wave to the next is called the **R-R Interval (RRI)**. This is the most common and widely recognized term in scientific and medical literature concerning HRV.\n\n*   **Point 2: The Stated Method (PPG):** The question specifies that a PPG sensor is used. A PPG sensor measures changes in blood volume in the microvascular bed of tissue, creating a waveform with peaks that correspond to heartbeats. The time measured from one peak to the next on this waveform is technically called the **Peak-to-Peak Interval (PPI)**.\n\n*   **Point 3: The General Term:** A more general, technology-agnostic term for this measurement is the **Inter-Beat Interval (IBI)**. This term can be used regardless of whether the data comes from an ECG, PPG, or another device.\n\n### Conclusion of Analysis\n\nWhile **Peak-to-Peak Interval (PPI)** is the most technically accurate term for data derived specifically from PPG, the term **R-R Interval (RRI)** is ubiquitously used in the field of HRV to refer to the beat-to-beat intervals, regardless of the source. It is understood to be the time between consecutive heartbeats. The term **Inter-Beat Interval (IBI)** is also perfectly correct and very common. All three terms (RRI, PPI, IBI) refer to the same fundamental concept. Given its widespread use in the context of HRV, R-R Interval is the most common answer.\n\nThe final answer is the name for this specific measurement of time between heartbeats.\n\n<<<R-R Interval (or Inter-Beat Interval)"
