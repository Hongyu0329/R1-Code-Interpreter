    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of each ballet step to determine which one ends with the legs in the same position as they started.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n*   The question asks for the ending *leg position* to be the *same* as the starting position. This means if a dancer starts in fifth position with the right foot in front, they must end in fifth position with the right foot in front.\n*   Many ballet steps have variations. We will analyze the standard, most common execution of each step as named.\n*   Terms like *changé* (changed), *dessus* (over), *dessous* (under), and *derrière* (behind) are crucial clues to how the feet will finish.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **A. Entrechat six**\n    *   **Start:** Typically begins in a demi-plié in fifth position (e.g., right foot front).\n    *   **Action:** This is a vertical jump where the legs perform six movements (three changes of position). The legs open and cross three times in the air. For an *entrechat six*, the leg that starts in front will beat back, then front, then land in the back.\n    *   **End:** The dancer lands in a demi-plié in fifth position, but the feet have switched places. The foot that started in front is now in the back.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The starting and ending positions are different.\n\n2.  **B. Échappé battu changé**\n    *   **Start:** Begins in a demi-plié in fifth position (e.g., right foot front).\n    *   **Action:** *Échappé* means to escape; the dancer jumps from the closed fifth position to an open second position. *Battu* means a beat is added as the legs close. The word *changé* explicitly means \"changed.\" As the legs close from second position back to fifth, the feet switch their front/back placement.\n    *   **End:** The dancer lands in a demi-plié in fifth position, but with the opposite foot in front.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The starting and ending positions are different.\n\n3.  **C. Assemblé**\n    *   **Start:** Begins in fifth position.\n    *   **Action:** *Assemblé* means \"to assemble.\" One leg brushes out to the side, front, or back, and the dancer jumps, bringing both legs together (\"assembling\") in the air before landing on both feet at the same time in fifth position. There are many types of *assemblé*:\n        *   *Assemblé dessus* (over) and *assemblé dessous* (under) both change the position of the feet.\n        *   An *assemblé en place* (on the spot), where the working leg brushes to the side and returns to its original spot, would not change the feet.\n    *   **End:** The ending position depends on the specific type of *assemblé* being performed. Since many common forms of *assemblé* do change the feet, this is not the most definitive answer.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The ending position can be the same, but it is often different.\n\n4.  **D. Glissade derrière**\n    *   **Start:** Begins in a demi-plié in fifth position (e.g., right foot front).\n    *   **Action:** *Glissade* means to glide. *Derrière* means \"behind.\" The back foot (left) glides out to the side, the weight transfers to it, and the front foot (right) then closes *behind* the left foot.\n    *   **End:** The dancer lands in fifth position with the feet switched. The foot that was in front (right) is now in the back.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The starting and ending positions are different.\n\n5.  **E. Gargouillade**\n    *   **Start:** Begins in a demi-plié in fifth position (e.g., right foot front).\n    *   **Action:** This is a complex, decorative jump, often described as a *pas de chat* with a circular movement (*rond de jambe*) from each leg. The first leg performs a *rond de jambe en l'air*, followed quickly by the second leg doing the same. The step is performed in a way that allows the dancer to land cleanly.\n    *   **End:** The standard execution of a *gargouillade* has the dancer landing back in the exact same fifth position they started in.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The starting and ending positions are the same.\n\n**Final Answer Acquisition:**\n\nAfter analyzing all the options, *Entrechat six*, *Échappé battu changé*, and *Glissade derrière* all result in a changed foot position. *Assemblé* is a broad category, and while some variations do not change the feet, many common ones do. *Gargouillade*, in its standard form, is specifically a step that starts and ends in the identical leg position. Therefore, it is the most correct answer.\n\n<<<E>>>"
