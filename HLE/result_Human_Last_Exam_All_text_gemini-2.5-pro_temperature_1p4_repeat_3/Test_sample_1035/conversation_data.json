    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the minimum number of vertices in a family of bipartite graphs covering all the edges of the complete graph $K_n$ where $n=35$.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the question and interpret the terminology\n\nThe question asks for the \"minimum number of vertices in a family of bipartite graphs\" that cover all the edges of $K_{35}$. Let the family of bipartite graphs be $\\mathcal{F} = \\{B_1, B_2, \\dots, B_k\\}$. Each $B_i$ is a subgraph of $K_{35}$.\n\nThe phrase \"number of vertices in a family\" is ambiguous. Let's analyze possible interpretations:\n1.  The number of graphs in the family, $k$. This is a standard problem in graph theory, but the question explicitly says \"number of vertices\".\n2.  The number of vertices in the union of the vertex sets, $|\\cup_{i=1}^k V(B_i)|$. Since the family must cover all edges of $K_{35}$, every vertex of $K_{35}$ must be part of at least one edge, and thus must belong to at least one graph $B_i$. Therefore, this union of vertices must be the entire vertex set of $K_{35}$, which has $n=35$ vertices. This interpretation leads to a trivial answer and is unlikely to be the subject of a minimization problem.\n3.  The sum of the number of vertices in each graph of the family, $\\sum_{i=1}^k |V(B_i)|$. This is a non-trivial optimization problem and is a plausible interpretation of the ambiguous phrasing. It asks for the minimum total number of vertex memberships across all graphs in the covering family.\n\nWe will proceed with the third interpretation, as it leads to a well-known problem in combinatorial theory.\n\n### Step 2: Relate general bipartite graphs to complete bipartite graphs (bicliques)\n\nLet $\\mathcal{F} = \\{B_1, B_2, \\dots, B_k\\}$ be a family of general bipartite graphs that covers the edges of $K_n$. For each graph $B_i$, its vertex set $V(B_i)$ can be partitioned into two independent sets, $U_i$ and $W_i$. An edge $(u,v)$ of $K_n$ is covered by the family if there exists at least one graph $B_j$ such that $(u,v)$ is an edge in $B_j$. This implies that $u$ and $v$ belong to $V(B_j)$ and are in different partitions, for example, $u \\in U_j$ and $v \\in W_j$.\n\nNow, consider a new family of graphs $\\mathcal{F}' = \\{C_1, C_2, \\dots, C_k\\}$, where each $C_i$ is the **complete** bipartite graph with the same partition as $B_i$, i.e., $C_i = K_{U_i, W_i}$.\nIf the edge $(u,v)$ is covered by $B_j$ in the original family, it means $u \\in U_j$ and $v \\in W_j$ (or vice versa). By definition of a complete bipartite graph, the edge $(u,v)$ must exist in $C_j=K_{U_j,W_j}$. Thus, if $\\mathcal{F}$ covers $K_n$, then $\\mathcal{F}'$ also covers $K_n$.\n\nThe number of vertices in $B_i$ is $|V(B_i)| = |U_i \\cup W_i|$. The number of vertices in $C_i$ is $|V(C_i)| = |U_i \\cup W_i|$. The sum of the number of vertices is the same for both families: $\\sum |V(B_i)| = \\sum |V(C_i)|$.\nThis means that any cover by general bipartite graphs can be transformed into a cover by complete bipartite graphs with the same total number of vertices. Therefore, the minimum value of $\\sum |V(B_i)|$ is the same whether we use general or complete bipartite graphs.\n\n### Step 3: Connect the problem to separating systems (coding theory)\n\nThe problem is now reduced to finding a family of complete bipartite graphs (bicliques) $\\{C_1, \\dots, C_k\\}$ that covers $K_n$ and minimizes $\\sum |V(C_i)|$.\n\nThis problem is equivalent to finding a \"separating system\". Let the vertices of $K_n$ be $\\{v_1, \\dots, v_n\\}$. We can assign a codeword $c(v_j) \\in \\{0, 1, *\\}^k$ to each vertex $v_j$. Each position $i$ in the codeword corresponds to a biclique $C_i$.\n- If the $i$-th character of the code for $v_j$ is 0 ($c_i(v_j)=0$), vertex $v_j$ is in the first partition $U_i$ of $C_i$.\n- If $c_i(v_j)=1$, vertex $v_j$ is in the second partition $W_i$ of $C_i$.\n- If $c_i(v_j)=*$, vertex $v_j$ is not in the biclique $C_i$ (i.e., $v_j \\notin V(C_i)$).\n\nThe condition that the family of bicliques $\\{C_i\\}$ covers all edges of $K_n$ means that for any pair of distinct vertices $u, v$, their assigned codewords must be \"separated\". That is, there must be at least one position $i$ where one codeword has a '0' and the other has a '1'. Formally, for any $u \\ne v$, there exists an $i \\in \\{1, \\dots, k\\}$ such that $\\{c_i(u), c_i(v)\\} = \\{0, 1\\}$.\n\nThe quantity to be minimized, $\\sum_{i=1}^k |V(C_i)|$, is the sum of the number of vertices in each biclique. This corresponds to the total number of non-`*` symbols in the matrix of codewords for all vertices.\n\n### Step 4: Apply the relevant theorem\n\nThis exact problem has been studied in combinatorics. A well-known theorem by G. Hansel (1966), which proved a conjecture by J. A. Bondy, gives the solution.\n\n**Theorem (Hansel):** The minimum value of $\\sum_{i=1}^k |V(C_i)|$ for a family of complete bipartite subgraphs $\\{C_i\\}$ that covers the edges of the complete graph $K_n$ is given by the formula $n \\lceil \\log_2 n \\rceil$.\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the final answer\n\nWe apply this formula for the given value of $n=35$.\n1.  First, we need to calculate $\\lceil \\log_2 n \\rceil$ for $n=35$.\n2.  We know the powers of 2:\n    $2^5 = 32$\n    $2^6 = 64$\n3.  Since $32 < 35 \\le 64$, we have $5 < \\log_2 35 \\le 6$.\n4.  The ceiling of $\\log_2 35$ is the smallest integer greater than or equal to $\\log_2 35$, which is 6. So, $\\lceil \\log_2 35 \\rceil = 6$.\n5.  Now, we multiply this by $n$:\n    Minimum number of vertices = $n \\times \\lceil \\log_2 n \\rceil = 35 \\times 6$.\n6.  $35 \\times 6 = 210$.\n\nThe minimum number of vertices, interpreted as the sum of vertex counts in the family of bipartite graphs, is 210.\n\n<<<210>>>"
