    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the exact number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a reductive group $G$ of type $E_8$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the core concepts and the question\n\n*   **Group G:** A reductive group of type $E_8$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$. We will assume this is the standard split, simple, and simply-connected group of type $E_8$. For type $E_8$, the center is trivial, so the simple, simply connected, and adjoint forms coincide.\n*   **Maximal Torus:** A maximal connected diagonalizable subgroup of $G$.\n*   **$\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational Maximal Torus:** A maximal torus that is a rational subvariety over $\\mathbb{F}_q$. This is equivalent to it being stable under the action of the Frobenius endomorphism $F$ associated with the $\\mathbb{F}_q$-structure.\n*   **The Question:** We need to find the total number of such subgroups in $G$. This is the size of the set of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational points of the variety of maximal tori, denoted $\\mathcal{T}(\\mathbb{F}_q)$.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the key formula for the calculation\n\nThe problem of counting rational maximal tori is a classical topic in the theory of finite groups of Lie type. The number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a connected reductive group $G$ defined over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is given by a formula, stated in several authoritative texts (e.g., Springer-Steinberg's \"Conjugacy Classes\", Digne-Michel's \"Finite Reductive Groups\").\n\nThe formula states that the number of $F$-stable maximal tori is:\n$$ |\\mathcal{T}(\\mathbb{F}_q)| = \\frac{|G(\\mathbb{F}_q)|}{|B(\\mathbb{F}_q)|} $$\nwhere $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$ is the group of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational points of $G$ and $B(\\mathbb{F}_q)$ is the group of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational points of a Borel subgroup $B$ that is defined over $\\mathbb{F}_q$. Since we assume $G$ is a split group, such a rational Borel subgroup exists.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the parameters for the group $E_8$\n\nTo use the formula, we need the orders of $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$ and $B(\\mathbb{F}_q)$. These orders depend on the combinatorial data of the root system of type $E_8$.\n\n*   **Rank (r):** The rank of $E_8$ is $r=8$.\n*   **Number of Positive Roots (N):** The root system of $E_8$ has 240 roots. The number of positive roots is $N = 240/2 = 120$.\n*   **Dimension of G:** The dimension of the group is the number of roots plus the rank: $\\dim(G) = 240 + 8 = 248$.\n*   **Degrees of Fundamental Invariants ($d_i$):** The degrees of the fundamental polynomial invariants of the Weyl group $W(E_8)$ are: $d_1=2, d_2=8, d_3=12, d_4=14, d_5=18, d_6=20, d_7=24, d_8=30$.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the order of $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$\n\nFor a split simple group over $\\mathbb{F}_q$, the order of the group of rational points is given by the Chevalley formula:\n$$ |G(\\mathbb{F}_q)| = q^N \\prod_{i=1}^{r} (q^{d_i} - 1) $$\nSubstituting the parameters for $E_8$:\n$$ |G(\\mathbb{F}_q)| = q^{120} (q^2-1)(q^8-1)(q^{12}-1)(q^{14}-1)(q^{18}-1)(q^{20}-1)(q^{24}-1)(q^{30}-1) $$\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the order of $B(\\mathbb{F}_q)$\n\nA Borel subgroup $B$ has a decomposition $B=TU$, where $T$ is a maximal torus and $U$ is the unipotent radical of $B$. For a split group and a rational Borel, this decomposition is also rational.\n\n*   $T$ is a split maximal torus of rank $r$. The order of its group of rational points is $|T(\\mathbb{F}_q)| = (q-1)^r$. For $E_8$, this is $(q-1)^8$.\n*   $U$ is the unipotent group corresponding to the set of positive roots. Its rational points are $|U(\\mathbb{F}_q)| = q^N$. For $E_8$, this is $q^{120}$.\n\nThe order of the rational points of the Borel subgroup is:\n$$ |B(\\mathbb{F}_q)| = |T(\\mathbb{F}_q)| \\cdot |U(\\mathbb{F}_q)| = (q-1)^8 \\cdot q^{120} $$\n\n### Step 6: Compute the final ratio\n\nNow we can compute the total number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori by taking the ratio of the orders calculated in the previous steps.\n\n$$ |\\mathcal{T}(\\mathbb{F}_q)| = \\frac{|G(\\mathbb{F}_q)|}{|B(\\mathbb{F}_q)|} = \\frac{q^{120} (q^2-1)(q^8-1)(q^{12}-1)(q^{14}-1)(q^{18}-1)(q^{20}-1)(q^{24}-1)(q^{30}-1)}{q^{120} (q-1)^8} $$\n\nThe $q^{120}$ terms cancel out:\n$$ |\\mathcal{T}(\\mathbb{F}_q)| = \\frac{(q^2-1)(q^8-1)(q^{12}-1)(q^{14}-1)(q^{18}-1)(q^{20}-1)(q^{24}-1)(q^{30}-1)}{(q-1)^8} $$\n\nThis expression can be expanded by factoring each term in the numerator using $q^k-1 = (q-1)(1+q+...+q^{k-1})$:\n$$ |\\mathcal{T}(\\mathbb{F}_q)| = \\left(\\frac{q^2-1}{q-1}\\right) \\left(\\frac{q^8-1}{q-1}\\right) \\left(\\frac{q^{12}-1}{q-1}\\right) \\left(\\frac{q^{14}-1}{q-1}\\right) \\left(\\frac{q^{18}-1}{q-1}\\right) \\left(\\frac{q^{20}-1}{q-1}\\right) \\left(\\frac{q^{24}-1}{q-1}\\right) \\left(\\frac{q^{30}-1}{q-1}\\right) $$\n$$ |\\mathcal{T}(\\mathbb{F}_q)| = (q+1)(q^7+q^6+...+1)(q^{11}+q^{10}+...+1)...(q^{29}+q^{28}+...+1) $$\n\nThe expression in its most compact and explicit polynomial form is the answer."
