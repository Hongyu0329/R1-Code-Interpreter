    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the identity of \"X-Y\".\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Key Figure and Context**\nThe question centers on Pavel Milyukov, a prominent Russian historian and politician who was a leader of the liberal Constitutional Democratic Party (Kadets). The context is his criticism of cultural trends of his era, specifically those he associated with Western culture. His active period was the late 19th and early 20th centuries, a time of significant artistic and intellectual change in Russia, often referred to as the \"Silver Age.\"\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Core Accusation and Metaphor**\nMilyukov is said to have denounced \"X-Ys\" as a \"stagnant swamp.\"\n*   **\"Stagnant swamp\"**: This metaphor suggests something that is decaying, unproductive, lacking fresh ideas, morally murky, and cut off from the healthy flow of life and progress.\n*   **\"X-Y\"**: This format indicates a two-part name, likely a hyphenated compound term for a group or movement.\n\n**Step 3: Consider Milyukov's Intellectual Position**\nPavel Milyukov was a positivist and a rationalist. He believed in progress, science, and the importance of civic responsibility in art and culture. He was a champion of Enlightenment values. Therefore, he would be highly critical of movements that he perceived as irrational, mystical, overly individualistic, amoral, or disconnected from social and political realities.\n\n**Step 4: Research Milyukov's Cultural Critiques**\nDuring the Russian Silver Age, the dominant new artistic and literary movements were Symbolism and Decadence. These movements were heavily influenced by Western European trends, particularly from France (e.g., Baudelaire, Verlaine, Mallarmé).\n*   **Decadence** emphasized themes of decay, artificiality, and a weariness with the modern world.\n*   **Symbolism** focused on mysticism, suggestion, and the \"other world\" of ideas and emotions, moving away from the realism of the 19th century.\nThese two movements were so closely intertwined in Russia that they were often referred to with a single, hyphenated term.\n\n**Step 5: Connect Milyukov's Position to the Movements**\nThe values of Symbolism and Decadence were in direct opposition to Milyukov's rationalist and civic-minded worldview. He saw these new artistic trends as a retreat from social responsibility and a sign of cultural decay—a \"stagnant swamp\" that was unproductive and unhealthy for the nation. Historical accounts of the period frequently cite Milyukov's fierce opposition to this \"new art.\"\n\n**Step 6: Identify \"X-Y\"**\nBased on the analysis, the two-part term \"X-Y\" that Milyukov criticized as a \"stagnant swamp\" refers to the artists and writers of these interconnected movements. The term that fits the structure and the historical context is \"Decadent-Symbolists.\"\n\n<<<Decadent-Symbolists>>>"
