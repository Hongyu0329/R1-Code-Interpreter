  "question": "In a recent excavation of an ancient Chinese tomb, people found two books called Ching and Shu. The Ching contains exactly 9999 symbols of yinyang-wuxing, such as yin-water or yang-fire. The Shu contains around 3000 ancient Chinese characters. Using advanced language modeling and computer vision technologies, people discover that the Shu is written with only 120 most common Chinese characters at that time. The computer vision tool can recognize such a character in 12 ms. Computation time for each operation on integers and floats is 10 ns and 30 ns, respectively.\n\nPeople believe that the Ching has a secret message encrypted with its symbols. This message is also written using the letters in the Shu. What is the max length of this message?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>.",

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the maximum length of the secret message.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Components of the Encryption:**\n    *   **Ciphertext (The Encrypted Message):** This is the content of the book *Ching*. It consists of 9999 symbols. These symbols are the encoded form of the secret message.\n    *   **Plaintext Alphabet (The \"Letters\" of the Message):** This is the set of characters used to write the original, unencrypted message. The problem states this is the set of 120 most common Chinese characters found in the book *Shu*.\n    *   **The Secret Message:** This is the original, unencrypted text that we want to find the maximum possible length of.\n\n2.  **Determine the Relationship Between Ciphertext and Plaintext:**\n    The problem states that the *Ching* (the 9999 symbols) *is* the secret message in its encrypted form. The message itself is written using the 120 characters from the *Shu*. This implies a mapping where the symbols from the *Ching* are decoded to produce the characters of the message.\n\n3.  **Find the Scheme that Maximizes Message Length:**\n    To find the *maximum* possible length of the secret message, we need to consider the most efficient encoding scheme in terms of length.\n    *   **Scenario A: One symbol decodes to one character.** This is the most straightforward and length-preserving mapping. For example, the first symbol in the *Ching* represents the first character of the message, the second symbol represents the second character, and so on.\n    *   **Scenario B: Multiple symbols decode to one character.** For example, a sequence of two symbols from the *Ching* might represent a single character of the message. This would result in a *shorter* message (e.g., 9999 symbols / 2 symbols per character â‰ˆ 4999 characters). This does not give the maximum length.\n    *   **Scenario C: One symbol decodes to multiple characters.** This is not a standard encryption method and is generally impractical. It would require a codebook where one symbol maps to a specific string of characters, but the fundamental limit is still the number of symbols available to encode information.\n\n    The scheme that yields the longest possible message is Scenario A, where each of the 9999 symbols in the *Ching* corresponds to exactly one character in the secret message.\n\n4.  **Identify and Discard Irrelevant Information (Careful Points):**\n    The problem includes several numbers and details that are designed to be distracting. It's crucial to identify what doesn't affect the final answer.\n    *   **\"The Shu contains around 3000 ancient Chinese characters.\"**: This is irrelevant. The important fact is the size of the *alphabet* used for the message, which is 120 characters, not the total number of characters in the sourcebook.\n    *   **\"The computer vision tool can recognize such a character in 12 ms.\"**: This is a detail about the speed of the technology used to analyze the *Shu*, not the *Ching*. It has no bearing on the length of the encrypted message.\n    *   **\"Computation time for each operation on integers and floats is 10 ns and 30 ns, respectively.\"**: This information relates to the processing speed of a computer, which is completely irrelevant to the principles of cryptography or information theory that determine the message's length.\n    *   **\"120 most common Chinese characters\"**: This number defines the size of the alphabet. It confirms that we have a set of characters to form a message. As long as the alphabet has at least two characters, a message can be written. The size of the alphabet does not limit the length of the message itself.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe book *Ching* contains 9999 symbols, which constitute the entire encrypted message. The most direct and length-maximizing interpretation is that each symbol encodes one character of the original message. Therefore, the maximum number of characters in the secret message is equal to the number of symbols in the *Ching*.\n\nMaximum message length = Number of symbols in the *Ching* = 9999.\n\n<<<9999>>>"
