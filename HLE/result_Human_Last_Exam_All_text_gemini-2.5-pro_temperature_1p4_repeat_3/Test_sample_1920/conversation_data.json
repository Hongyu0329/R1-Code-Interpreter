    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters $\\chi$ of conductor $d=53599$ and order $6$.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Factorize the Conductor**\n\nThe first step is to find the prime factorization of the conductor $d = 53599$.\n*   We can test small prime divisors. $d$ is not divisible by 2, 3, or 5.\n*   Dividing by 7: $53599 = 7 \\times 7657$.\n*   Now we factor 7657. Let's test primes. $7657$ is not divisible by 11.\n*   Dividing by 13: $7657 = 13 \\times 589$.\n*   Now we factor 589. Let's test primes. $589$ is not divisible by 17.\n*   Dividing by 19: $589 = 19 \\times 31$.\n*   Both 19 and 31 are prime numbers.\n\nSo, the prime factorization of the conductor is $d = 7 \\times 13 \\times 19 \\times 31$.\nThis is a square-free integer.\n\n**2. Understand Primitive Characters and their Structure**\n\nA Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $d = p_1 p_2 \\cdots p_k$ can be uniquely expressed as a product of characters $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\cdots \\chi_k$, where each $\\chi_i$ is a character modulo the prime factor $p_i$.\n\n*   **Primitivity:** For a square-free conductor $d$ (like the one we have), a character $\\chi \\pmod d$ is primitive if and only if each of its component characters $\\chi_i \\pmod{p_i}$ is non-trivial. The trivial character is the one that maps all numbers to 1; its conductor is 1. Any non-trivial character modulo a prime $p$ has conductor $p$. For the conductor of $\\chi$ to be $d = \\prod p_i$, the conductor of each $\\chi_i$ must be $p_i$, which means each $\\chi_i$ must be non-trivial.\n\n*   **Order:** The order of the character $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\chi_3 \\chi_4$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters:\n    $\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_1), \\text{ord}(\\chi_2), \\text{ord}(\\chi_3), \\text{ord}(\\chi_4))$.\n    We are given that this order must be 6.\n\n**3. Analyze the Component Character Groups**\n\nFor a prime $p$, the group of Dirichlet characters modulo $p$ is a cyclic group of order $\\phi(p) = p-1$. The number of characters of order $k$ in this group is given by Euler's totient function $\\phi(k)$, provided that $k$ divides $p-1$.\n\nLet's look at our prime factors:\n*   $p_1=7$: The character group has order $\\phi(7) = 6$.\n*   $p_2=13$: The character group has order $\\phi(13) = 12$.\n*   $p_3=19$: The character group has order $\\phi(19) = 18$.\n*   $p_4=31$: The character group has order $\\phi(31) = 30$.\n\nWe need $\\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_1), \\text{ord}(\\chi_2), \\text{ord}(\\chi_3), \\text{ord}(\\chi_4)) = 6$. This implies that the order of each component character, $\\text{ord}(\\chi_i)$, must be a divisor of 6. Since each $\\chi_i$ must be non-trivial, its order cannot be 1.\nSo, for each $i$, $\\text{ord}(\\chi_i) \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$.\n\nWe need to check if characters of these orders exist for each prime factor:\n*   For a prime $p$, characters of order $k \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$ exist if $k$ divides $p-1$.\n*   For $p=7$, $p-1=6$. Divisible by 2, 3, 6.\n*   For $p=13$, $p-1=12$. Divisible by 2, 3, 6.\n*   For $p=19$, $p-1=18$. Divisible by 2, 3, 6.\n*   For $p=31$, $p-1=30$. Divisible by 2, 3, 6.\nSince 6 divides $p_i-1$ for all our primes $p_i$, the number of characters of a given order $k$ (where $k|6$) is the same for all four components.\n*   Number of characters of order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$.\n*   Number of characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n*   Number of characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = \\phi(2)\\phi(3) = 1 \\times 2 = 2$.\n\n**4. Count the Characters using Inclusion-Exclusion**\n\nWe need to count the number of 4-tuples of characters $(\\chi_1, \\chi_2, \\chi_3, \\chi_4)$ where:\n1.  $\\text{ord}(\\chi_i) \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$ for each $i$.\n2.  $\\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_1), \\dots, \\text{ord}(\\chi_4)) = 6$.\n\nThe second condition means that the set of orders must contain at least one order divisible by 2 (i.e., 2 or 6) AND at least one order divisible by 3 (i.e., 3 or 6).\n\nLet's use complementary counting.\nLet $S$ be the set of all primitive characters where the order of each component $\\chi_i$ divides 6 (i.e., $\\text{ord}(\\chi_i) \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$).\n*   For each component $\\chi_i$, the number of choices is the sum of the number of characters of orders 2, 3, and 6.\n*   Number of choices for each $\\chi_i$: $1 + 2 + 2 = 5$.\n*   Since there are 4 components, the total number of characters in $S$ is $|S| = 5 \\times 5 \\times 5 \\times 5 = 625$.\n\nNow, we must subtract from $|S|$ the characters whose order is not 6. These are the characters where the lcm of the component orders is a proper divisor of 6 (i.e., 1, 2, or 3). Since the components are non-trivial, the order cannot be 1.\n\n*   **Case 1: The order divides 2 (i.e., the order is 2).**\n    This happens if $\\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_i))$ divides 2. This requires every $\\text{ord}(\\chi_i)$ to divide 2. Since the characters are non-trivial, $\\text{ord}(\\chi_i)=2$ for all $i$.\n    *   Number of characters of order 2 for each component: $\\phi(2)=1$.\n    *   Total number of such characters: $1 \\times 1 \\times 1 \\times 1 = 1$.\n\n*   **Case 2: The order divides 3 (i.e., the order is 3).**\n    This happens if $\\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_i))$ divides 3. This requires every $\\text{ord}(\\chi_i)$ to divide 3. Since the characters are non-trivial, $\\text{ord}(\\chi_i)=3$ for all $i$.\n    *   Number of characters of order 3 for each component: $\\phi(3)=2$.\n    *   Total number of such characters: $2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 16$.\n\nThe set of characters whose order divides 2 and the set of characters whose order divides 3 are disjoint (except for the trivial character, which we have excluded). Therefore, we can simply subtract these counts.\n\nThe number of primitive characters of order 6 is:\nTotal characters in $S$ - (characters of order 2) - (characters of order 3)\n$= 625 - 1 - 16 = 608$.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $d = 53599$ and order $6$ is 608.\n\n<<<608>>>"
