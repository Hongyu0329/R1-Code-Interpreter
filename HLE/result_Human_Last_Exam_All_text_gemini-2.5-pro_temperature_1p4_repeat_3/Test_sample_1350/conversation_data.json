    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the Core Question:** The request asks for a specific character from William Morris's novel *The House of the Wolfings*. This character must meet two criteria:\n    *   They must have visited a Roman city or lived among Romans.\n    *   They must have described Roman religious beliefs or foundation myths in a way that alludes to the story of Romulus and Remus.\n\n2.  **Identify Potential Characters:** We need to consider the main characters of the book and their backstories, specifically their interactions with the Romans.\n    *   **Thiodolf:** The war-leader of the Wolfings and the protagonist. His backstory is crucial; it is explicitly stated that he spent time in his youth as a hostage among the Romans. This makes him the most likely candidate, as he would have had firsthand exposure to their culture and stories.\n    *   **The Hall-Sun (Asdis):** A supernatural being, a daughter of a god (Odin/the Wood-Sun), and Thiodolf's foster-daughter. While she has divine knowledge, her experience is not presented as having come from living in a Roman city. Her knowledge is mystical and ancient, not ethnographic.\n    *   **Otter, Eyolf, and other Wolfing warriors:** These characters primarily know the Romans as an enemy force to be fought. There is no indication they have lived among them or studied their culture.\n\n3.  **Locate the Specific Scene:** The key is to find the passage where Roman culture is discussed by one of these characters. This occurs early in the book when the Wolfings are gathered in their great hall to hear news of the approaching Roman army and decide on a course of action.\n    *   In **Chapter II, \"The Tidings,\"** Thiodolf addresses the assembled tribe. He uses the knowledge he gained during his time as a captive to explain the nature of their Roman foe.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Character's Description:** During his speech, Thiodolf describes the power, organization, and beliefs of the Romans to his people. He speaks of the city from which they come and mentions their foundation myth.\n    *   He tells the Wolfings that the Romans have a story about the founder of their great city.\n    *   He explicitly states that this founder was said to have been a \"wolf-child,\" who was suckled by a **she-wolf** alongside his **brother**.\n    *   This description is an unmistakable reference to the Roman foundation myth of **Romulus and Remus**, the twin brothers who were abandoned as infants and nursed by a she-wolf before Romulus went on to found the city of Rome.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** Thiodolf is the character who was a captive of the Romans, allowing him to have \"visited a Roman city.\" It is Thiodolf who, in Chapter II, describes their foundation myth to his fellow Wolfings, using the clear imagery of two brothers being suckled by a she-wolf, which readers immediately recognize as the story of Romulus and Remus.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Distinguishing between experience and divine knowledge:** It's important to distinguish between Thiodolf's knowledge, gained from direct experience living among the Romans, and the Hall-Sun's supernatural knowledge. The question's phrasing (\"visited a Roman city and describes\") points to firsthand experience.\n*   **Thematic Irony:** Thiodolf's description creates a powerful irony. He is explaining the wolf-related origin myth of the Romans to his own people, the \"Wolfings,\" whose banner is a wolf. This highlights the deep, almost mythic connection and conflict between the two peoples.\n*   **Source of Information:** The information is delivered in a speech from Thiodolf to the tribe, serving as exposition for both the Wolfings within the story and the reader.\n\n***\n<<<Thiodolf>>>"
