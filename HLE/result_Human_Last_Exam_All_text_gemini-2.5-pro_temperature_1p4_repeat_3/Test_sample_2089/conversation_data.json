    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to arrive at the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question's Clues:**\n    *   **Film Status:** It must be an \"Oscar-nominated film.\" This narrows the search to a list of critically acclaimed movies.\n    *   **The Character:** The prompt mentions \"a character,\" not necessarily the main protagonist.\n    *   **The Action:** The character is \"boarding a bus.\" This could also be a truck or similar transport vehicle.\n    *   **The Dialogue:** The character says the specific words \"Thank you.\" The language might be important.\n    *   **The Consequence:** This action \"seals his fate,\" implying a tragic, immediate, and irreversible outcome, most likely death.\n\n2.  **Initial Brainstorming and Elimination:**\n    *   One might initially think of films like *No Country for Old Men*, where the protagonist is on the run, or *Inglourious Basterds*, which features scenes where a character's accent or a small gesture gives them away.\n    *   However, in *Inglourious Basterds*, the giveaway is a hand gesture in a tavern, not saying \"thank you\" on a bus.\n    *   In *No Country for Old Men*, while the protagonist Llewelyn Moss is on the run and uses various vehicles, there isn't a scene that precisely matches this description.\n    *   This specificity suggests the film might be a non-English language movie, as a polite phrase in the wrong language is a classic way to reveal one's identity.\n\n3.  **Identifying the Correct Film:**\n    *   The film that perfectly matches all these criteria is **_The Counterfeiters_** (German: *Die FÃ¤lscher*).\n    *   **Oscar Nomination Status:** _The Counterfeiters_ won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film at the 80th Academy Awards in 2008, confirming it is an Oscar-winning (and therefore nominated) film.\n\n4.  **Analyzing the Specific Scene in _The Counterfeiters_:**\n    *   **Context:** The film is set in a Nazi concentration camp during World War II. A group of prisoners with artistic or printing skills are being separated for a top-secret counterfeiting operation.\n    *   **The Character:** A young, naive prisoner named Kolya Karloff is among a new group of arrivals.\n    *   **The Action and Dialogue:** The prisoners are being herded onto trucks. They are under the impression they might be going to a better facility. As the hopeful Kolya boards the truck, he turns to the SS guard and politely says **\"Spasibo\"** (Russian for \"Thank you\").\n    *   **Sealing His Fate:** The Nazi guard immediately recognizes the Russian language. As Russians and other Slavs were considered \"subhuman\" by the Nazis and were not part of the skilled group selected for the counterfeiting operation, the guard knows Kolya is not supposed to be there. The guard instantly pulls Kolya from the line and shoots him dead. The simple, polite phrase directly caused his immediate execution.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **The specific phrase:** The dialogue is \"Thank you,\" but it is said in Russian (\"Spasibo\"). This is the crucial detail that gets the character identified and killed.\n*   **The setting:** The context of a Nazi concentration camp explains the extreme and immediate brutality of the consequence. A minor slip-up has fatal results.\n*   **The character's innocence:** Kolya's politeness and naivety make the moment particularly tragic and memorable. He does not realize his fatal mistake until it is too late.\n*   **Distinction from other films:** It is important not to confuse this scene with similarly themed scenes in other movies. The combination of the Oscar nomination, the bus/truck, the specific phrase \"Thank you,\" and the immediate lethal consequence is unique to *The Counterfeiters*.\n\nBy following this analysis, we can confidently identify the film.\n\n<<<The Counterfeiters>>>"
