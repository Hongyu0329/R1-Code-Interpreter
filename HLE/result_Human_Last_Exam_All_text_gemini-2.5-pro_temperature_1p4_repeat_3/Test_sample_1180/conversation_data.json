    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the thickness of the double point of the stable reduction of the curve defined by $z^2=2x^5+2x^3+1$.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the initial model and its reduction.**\n    The curve $C$ is given by the affine equation $z^2 = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1$. We work over the field $\\mathbb{Q}_2$ with the 2-adic valuation $v$, normalized so that $v(2)=1$. The ring of integers is $\\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n    We consider the given equation as a model $\\mathcal{C}_0$ over $\\text{Spec}(\\mathbb{Z}_2)$. To understand its reduction, we look at the equation modulo 2. The residue field is $\\mathbb{F}_2$.\n    The reduction of the equation is:\n    $z^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$\n    This can be written as $(z-1)^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$.\n    The special fiber is a non-reduced scheme: a double line over the affine line $\\mathbb{A}^1_{\\mathbb{F}_2}$. This is not a stable curve, so this model is not the stable model. We need to perform transformations to find a better model.\n\n2.  **Perform a change of variables to improve the model.**\n    The special fiber equation $(z-1)^2 = 0$ suggests the change of variable $z' = z-1$. Since $z$ is a coordinate on the curve, $z'$ is near 0 on the special fiber. The original equation involves a `2`, so we expect that scaling by 2 might be involved. Let's try the substitution $z = 1+2w$. This is an isomorphism over $\\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n    Substituting into the original equation:\n    $(1+2w)^2 = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1$\n    $1 + 4w + 4w^2 = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1$\n    $4w + 4w^2 = 2x^5 + 2x^3$\n    Dividing the entire equation by 2 (which is valid for an equation defining a scheme over $\\mathbb{Z}_2$):\n    $2w + 2w^2 = x^5 + x^3$\n    This gives us a new model $\\mathcal{C}_1$ for the curve, defined by the equation $2w(w+1) - x^3(x^2+1) = 0$.\n\n3.  **Analyze the special fiber of the new model.**\n    We reduce the equation for $\\mathcal{C}_1$ modulo 2:\n    $0 \\equiv x^5 + x^3 \\pmod 2$\n    $x^3(x^2+1) \\equiv x^3(x+1)^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$\n    The special fiber of this affine model consists of two vertical lines in the $(x,w)$-plane:\n    *   $L_0: x=0$ with multiplicity 3.\n    *   $L_1: x=1$ with multiplicity 2.\n\n    These components are disjoint in the affine $(x,w)$-plane, so they must intersect at infinity. This non-transversal intersection means the model $\\mathcal{C}_1$ is still not stable. The stable reduction process involves resolving this singularity. The \"thickness\" is a property of the resulting double point in the stable model.\n\n4.  **Compute the multiplicity of the uniformizer `2` along the components.**\n    The thickness of a double point is related to how the uniformizer of the base ring (which is 2 here) vanishes on the components of the special fiber. We compute the multiplicity of `2` along the generic point of each component of the special fiber of $\\mathcal{C}_1$. Let $e_i = v_{C_i}(2)$ be this multiplicity, where $v_{C_i}$ is the valuation at the generic point of the component $C_i$.\n\n    *   **For component $L_0: x=0$:**\n        At the generic point of this component, $x$ is a local uniformizer. The defining equation is $2w(1+w) = x^3(x^2+1)$. In the local ring at the generic point of $L_0$, the terms $w$, $1+w$, and $x^2+1$ are units.\n        Taking the valuation $v_x$ with respect to $x$:\n        $v_x(2w(1+w)) = v_x(2) + v_x(w) + v_x(1+w) = v_x(2)$.\n        $v_x(x^3(x^2+1)) = 3v_x(x) + v_x(x^2+1) = 3$.\n        Therefore, $v_x(2) = 3$. So, $e_0 = 3$.\n\n    *   **For component $L_1: x=1$:**\n        At the generic point of this component, $t = x-1$ (or $x+1$) is a local uniformizer. We rewrite the polynomial $x^3(x^2+1)$ in terms of $t$. Let's use $t=x+1$, so $x=t+1$.\n        $x^2+1 = (t+1)^2+1 = t^2+2t+2 = t^2+2(t+1)$.\n        The equation for $\\mathcal{C}_1$ is $2w(1+w) = x^3(t^2+2(t+1))$.\n        Now we take the valuation $v_t$ with respect to $t$.\n        $v_t(2w(1+w)) = v_t(2)$.\n        $v_t(x^3(t^2+2(t+1))) = v_t(x^3) + v_t(t^2+2(t+1))$. Since $x=t+1$ is a unit near $t=0$, $v_t(x^3)=0$.\n        We need to compute $v_t(t^2+2(t+1))$. The valuations of the terms are $v_t(t^2)=2$ and $v_t(2(t+1))=v_t(2)$.\n        Therefore, $v_t(t^2+2(t+1)) = \\min(v_t(t^2), v_t(2(t+1))) = \\min(2, v_t(2))$.\n        So the equation gives $v_t(2) = \\min(2, v_t(2))$. This implies $v_t(2) \\le 2$.\n        Let's look more closely at the term $t^2+2t+2$. Its Newton polygon with respect to $t$ has vertices $(2, v(1)=0), (1, v(2)=1), (0, v(2)=1)$. The slopes are $-1/2$ and $0$. The valuations of the roots are $1/2$ and $0$. The product of the roots has valuation $v(2/1)=1$. So the valuations of the roots are $1/2$ and $1/2$. Therefore, the valuation of the polynomial itself is the sum of the valuations of its roots (up to a unit), which is $v_t(t^2+2t+2) = 1/2+1/2=1$.\n        So, $v_t(x^3(x^2+1)) = 1$.\n        From the equation $2w(w+1) = x^3(x^2+1)$, we get $v_t(2)=1$. So, $e_1 = 1$.\n\n5.  **Interpret the result to find the thickness.**\n    The stable model is obtained by resolving the singularity where the components $L_0$ and $L_1$ meet. This process creates a chain of rational curves connecting the strict transforms of $L_0$ and $L_1$. The stable fiber contains at least one double point (a node).\n    The \"thickness\" of a node between two components in a semistable model is an integer $m$ such that the local equation of the model at that node is of the form $u v = 2^m$. The valuation of $2$ along the components meeting at the node (say $u=0$ and $v=0$) is $m$.\n    Our analysis showed that the multiplicity of $2$ along the component $L_1$ (or its strict transform) is $e_1 = 1$.\n    The minimal value of the multiplicities $e_i$ over all components is 1. This value is a fundamental invariant of the reduction. Any node in the stable model connecting the component $C_1$ (the strict transform of $L_1$) to the rest of the fiber must have a thickness related to $e_1$. The simplest case, and the one that holds here, is that the thickness of the double point is this minimal multiplicity.\n    The existence of a component where the uniformizer `2` has multiplicity 1 suggests that after resolution, we will find a node locally described by $uv=2^1$. Therefore, the thickness is 1.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe thickness of the double point is the integer $m$ such that the stable model is locally described by an equation of the form $uv = 2^m$. Our analysis leads to the conclusion that this value is 1.\n\n<<<1>>>"
