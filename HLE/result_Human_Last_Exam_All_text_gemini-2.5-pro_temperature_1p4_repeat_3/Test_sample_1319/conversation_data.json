    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the final answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe question asks for four specific things:\n1.  A mountain that is **mentioned in the *Iliad***.\n2.  The mountain must be a **historical**, real-world location.\n3.  It must be the **tallest** among the candidates.\n4.  It must **not be Mount Olympus**, which is explicitly excluded as the primary reference.\n\n### **Step 2: Identify the Mountains Mentioned in the *Iliad***\nFirst, we must compile a list of real mountains that are referenced in the epic poem.\n\n*   **Mount Olympus:** The home of the gods. It is the tallest mountain in Greece (2,918 m / 9,573 ft) but is explicitly excluded from the answer.\n*   **Mount Ida (near Troy):** A very prominent mountain in the *Iliad*. Zeus travels to its highest peak, Gargarus, to watch over the battle on the Trojan plain (e.g., in Book 8 and Book 14). This is a real mountain range in modern-day Turkey.\n*   **The peak of Samothrace (Mount Fengari):** In Book 13, the god Poseidon sits on the highest peak of the wooded island of Samothrace to watch the battle. From this vantage point, he could see Mount Ida, Troy, and the ships of the Achaeans. Samothrace is a real Greek island in the northern Aegean Sea.\n*   **Mount Athos:** In Book 14, as Hera journeys from Olympus to Lemnos to deceive Zeus, she travels over the snowy peaks of the Thracian mountains, and the text explicitly says she stepped \"on the peak of Athos\". Mount Athos is a real mountain and peninsula in northeastern Greece.\n*   **Mount Pelion:** This mountain in Thessaly is mentioned as the source of the great ash spear that was given to Peleus and later wielded by his son, Achilles.\n*   **Mount Othrys:** This mountain is mentioned in the \"Catalogue of Ships\" in Book 2 as one of the borders of the kingdom ruled by Protesilaus.\n\n### **Step 3: Determine the Elevations of the Candidate Mountains**\nNow, we must find the real-world elevations of these historical mountains to compare them.\n\n*   **Mount Olympus:** 2,918 m (9,573 ft) - *Excluded*\n*   **Mount Athos:** **2,033 m (6,670 ft)**\n*   **Mount Ida (Turkey, Kaz Dağı):** The highest peak is approximately 1,774 m (5,820 ft).\n*   **Mount Othrys:** The highest peak is approximately 1,726 m (5,663 ft).\n*   **Mount Pelion:** The highest peak is approximately 1,624 m (5,328 ft).\n*   **Mount Samothrace (Fengari):** The highest peak is approximately 1,611 m (5,285 ft).\n\n### **Step 4: Compare the Heights and Conclude**\nComparing the elevations of the mountains mentioned in the *Iliad* (other than Olympus):\n\n1.  **Mount Athos: 2,033 m**\n2.  Mount Ida: 1,774 m\n3.  Mount Othrys: 1,726 m\n4.  Mount Pelion: 1,624 m\n5.  Mount Samothrace: 1,611 m\n\nThe tallest mountain among these candidates is Mount Athos. It is a historical mountain, explicitly mentioned in the *Iliad*, and is the tallest after Mount Olympus.\n\n### **Careful Points to Note**\n*   **Distinguishing between myth and geography:** The mountains in the *Iliad* are used as settings for the gods, but they correspond to real geographical locations whose heights can be measured.\n*   **Two Mount Idas:** It's important to focus on the Mount Ida near Troy (in modern Turkey), not the one on Crete, which is famous for the birth of Zeus but not central to the *Iliad's* narrative.\n*   **Explicit mention:** All listed candidates have a clear reference in the text, from a major divine viewpoint (Ida, Samothrace) to a landmark on a journey (Athos) or a geographical reference (Pelion, Othrys).\n\nBy following these steps, we arrive at the correct answer.\n\n<<<Mount Athos>>>"
