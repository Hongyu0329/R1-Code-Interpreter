    "An analysis of the problem leads to the following step-by-step reasoning:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the object and its orientation.**\nThe tank has the shape of a regular icosahedron. An icosahedron is a polyhedron with 20 faces, 30 edges, and 12 vertices. Each face is an equilateral triangle. The tank is \"standing on one of its faces,\" which means one of its triangular faces is horizontal and forms the base.\n\n**Step 2: Interpret the \"half-filled\" condition.**\nThe tank is half-filled with water. This means the volume of the water is exactly half the total volume of the icosahedron. The surface of the water will be a horizontal plane. The question is asking for the shape of this horizontal cross-section of the icosahedron.\n\n**Step 3: Utilize the symmetry of the icosahedron.**\nA regular icosahedron has a high degree of symmetry, including a point of central symmetry (or inversion symmetry). Any plane that passes through the geometric center of the icosahedron divides its volume into two equal halves. Therefore, for the tank to be half-filled, the water level must be at the height of the icosahedron's geometric center.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the location of the geometric center.**\nWhen an icosahedron rests on one face, there is another face on the opposite side that is parallel to the base. Due to the symmetry of the icosahedron, its geometric center is located exactly at the midpoint of the height between the bottom face and the parallel top face.\n\n**Step 5: Identify the shape of the cross-section at the center.**\nWe need to determine the shape of the horizontal cross-section of the icosahedron that passes through its center. Let's consider the arrangement of the 12 vertices of the icosahedron in this orientation:\n*   3 vertices form the triangular base.\n*   3 vertices form the parallel triangular top face.\n*   The remaining 6 vertices (12 - 3 - 3 = 6) are situated between the top and bottom faces. Due to symmetry, these 6 vertices must lie on a single horizontal plane that is exactly halfway between the base and the top face. This is the plane that passes through the center of the icosahedron.\n\nThe shape of the water surface is therefore the polygon formed by connecting these 6 mid-level vertices.\n\n**Step 6: Analyze the properties of the resulting polygon.**\nThe 6 vertices on the central plane form a hexagon. To determine if this hexagon is regular, we again look at the symmetry of the icosahedron.\n*   The vertical axis passing through the centers of the triangular base and top face is an axis of 3-fold rotational symmetry. Since the central plane is perpendicular to this axis, the hexagon must also have 3-fold rotational symmetry.\n*   The icosahedron also has multiple planes of reflection symmetry that pass through the center. These planes cut through the hexagon, forcing its side lengths and angles to be equal.\n\nA hexagon with both equal sides and equal angles is a regular hexagon.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWhen the icosahedron tank standing on a face is half-filled, the water surface forms a horizontal plane passing through the center of the icosahedron. This central cross-section is a regular hexagon.\n\n<<<A regular hexagon>>>"
