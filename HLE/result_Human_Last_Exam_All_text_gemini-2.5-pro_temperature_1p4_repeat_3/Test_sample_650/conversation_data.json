    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the algorithm's computational time complexity.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Question\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to determine the computational time complexity of the provided algorithm `IMAG(n, c)`. This means we need to find out how the number of elementary operations performed by the algorithm grows as the input `n` gets larger.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Algorithm's Function:** The algorithm takes an integer `n` and a base `c` and computes the base `c` representation of `n`. This is the standard \"repeated division\" method for base conversion. For example, to convert 13 to base 2, you repeatedly divide by 2 and record the remainders:\n    *   13 / 2 = 6 remainder 1  ($a_0$)\n    *   6 / 2 = 3 remainder 0   ($a_1$)\n    *   3 / 2 = 1 remainder 1   ($a_2$)\n    *   1 / 2 = 0 remainder 1   ($a_3$)\n    The result is 1101 in base 2. The algorithm implements this exact logic.\n\n3.  **Break Down the Algorithm into Parts:**\n    *   **Step 1 (Initialization):** `i := 0; x := n; q := ⌊x/c⌋; a_{0} := x — qc;`\n        This step involves a few basic arithmetic operations (assignment, division, multiplication, subtraction). These are considered elementary operations, and this step takes a constant amount of time. We can denote this as O(1).\n    *   **Step 2 (The `while` loop):** `while q > 0, do ... od`\n        This is the main part of the algorithm. The total time complexity will be determined by how many times this loop runs. Inside the loop (`2.1`), there are again a few elementary operations which take constant time, O(1), for each iteration.\n    *   **Step 3 (Return):** `return ((a_{i}a_{i - 1}, …, a_{1} a_{0}))`\n        This step simply returns the computed result. It also takes constant time, O(1).\n\n4.  **Focus on the Dominant Part:** The `while` loop is the only part of the algorithm whose execution count depends on the input `n`. The overall complexity will be the number of loop iterations multiplied by the complexity of the work done inside the loop.\n\n### Listing Careful Points\n\n*   **Model of Computation:** We assume a standard model where basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on integers take constant time, O(1). This is a standard assumption unless we are dealing with arbitrary-precision arithmetic where the numbers are too large to fit in a processor's word.\n*   **Loop Control Variable:** The loop continues as long as `q > 0`. The value of `q` is systematically reduced in each pass of the algorithm.\n*   **How the Variable Changes:** Let's trace the value passed to `x` in each iteration.\n    - Before the loop, the first quotient is `q = ⌊n/c⌋`.\n    - In the first iteration, `x` is set to this `q`, so `x ≈ n/c`.\n    - In the second iteration, `x` becomes the new quotient, so `x ≈ (n/c)/c = n/c²`.\n    - After `k` iterations, `x` will be approximately `n/c^k`.\n*   **Loop Termination Condition:** The loop stops when `q` becomes 0. `q` is calculated as `⌊x/c⌋`. This means the loop will terminate when the current value of `x` is less than `c` (i.e., `x < c`), because then `⌊x/c⌋` will be 0.\n*   **Connecting to Logarithms:** The process of repeatedly dividing a number `n` by a constant `c` until it becomes less than a certain value is inherently logarithmic. The number of divisions needed is proportional to `log_c(n)`.\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer with Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the number of loop iterations:** The loop runs as long as the quotient `q` is greater than zero. Let `k` be the number of iterations.\n    - At the start (before the loop), `q` is `⌊n/c⌋`.\n    - After 1 iteration, the new `q` is `⌊(⌊n/c⌋)/c⌋ = ⌊n/c²⌋`.\n    - After `k-1` iterations, `q` is `⌊n/c^k⌋`.\n    The loop runs for the `k`-th time if the value of `q` after `k-1` iterations is greater than 0. That is, if `⌊n/c^k⌋ > 0`.\n\n2.  **Solve for the number of iterations:** We need to find the number of times `k` for which `⌊n/c^k⌋ > 0`.\n    This inequality holds as long as `n/c^k ≥ 1`, which is equivalent to `n ≥ c^k`.\n\n3.  To find `k`, we can solve for it in the inequality `n ≥ c^k`. By taking the logarithm base `c` of both sides, we get:\n    `log_c(n) ≥ log_c(c^k)`\n    `log_c(n) ≥ k`\n    This means the number of iterations `k` is proportional to `log_c(n)`. More precisely, the loop runs `⌊log_c(n)⌋` times (for `n ≥ c`). This is also `d-1`, where `d = ⌊log_c(n)⌋ + 1` is the number of digits in the base-c representation of `n`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the total complexity:**\n    *   The work inside the loop is O(1).\n    *   The number of loop iterations is `O(log_c n)`.\n    *   The total time complexity of the loop is (Number of Iterations) × (Work per Iteration) = `O(log_c n) * O(1) = O(log_c n)`.\n\n5.  **Finalize the complexity expression:** The total time complexity of the algorithm `IMAG(n, c)` is the sum of the complexities of its parts:\n    `T(n) = T_initialization + T_loop + T_return`\n    `T(n) = O(1) + O(log_c n) + O(1) = O(log_c n)`\n\n    In Big-O notation, the base of the logarithm does not affect the complexity class because of the change of base formula: `log_c(n) = log_b(n) / log_b(c)`. Since `c` is a constant (`c ≥ 2`), `log_b(c)` is also a constant. Constant factors are ignored in Big-O notation. Therefore, `O(log_c n)` is equivalent to `O(log n)`.\n\nThe computational time complexity of the algorithm is `O(log n)`.\n\n<<<O(log n)>>>"
