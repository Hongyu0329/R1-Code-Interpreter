    "The user wants to find the number of non-zero coefficients of order 10 in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) expansion.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) Formula**\n\nThe BCH formula provides an expression for $Z = \\log(e^X e^Y)$, where $X$ and $Y$ are non-commuting variables (like matrices). The result is an infinite series of nested commutators of $X$ and $Y$.\n\n$Z = X + Y + \\frac{1}{2}[X, Y] + \\frac{1}{12}([X, [X, Y]] - [Y, [X, Y]]) + \\dots$\n\nThe \"order\" of a term refers to the total number of $X$'s and $Y$'s in it (its total degree). For example, $[X, [X, Y]]$ is a term of order 3. The formula can be written as $Z = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty Z_n(X, Y)$, where $Z_n$ is the sum of all terms of order $n$.\n\n**Step 2: Relate the problem to Free Lie Algebras**\n\nThe terms in the BCH expansion, like $[X, Y]$ and $[X, [X, Y]]$, are elements of the free Lie algebra generated by $X$ and $Y$. It is a fundamental result in the theory of Lie algebras that the BCH expansion contains one term for each basis element of the free Lie algebra, and the coefficient of each of these terms is non-zero.\n\nTherefore, the problem of finding the number of non-zero coefficients of a certain order is equivalent to finding the number of linearly independent commutators of that order. This, in turn, is equal to the dimension of the homogeneous subspace of that degree in the free Lie algebra.\n\n**Step 3: Introduce Witt's Formula**\n\nThe dimension of the homogeneous subspace of degree $n$ of the free Lie algebra on $k$ generators is given by Ernst Witt's formula:\n\n$L_k(n) = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{d|n} \\mu(d) k^{n/d}$\n\nWhere:\n*   $n$ is the order (degree).\n*   $k$ is the number of generators.\n*   The sum is over all positive integers $d$ that divide $n$.\n*   $\\mu(d)$ is the Möbius function.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Parameters for the Problem**\n\n*   We are interested in terms of **order 10**, so $n=10$.\n*   The expansion is in terms of two variables, $X$ and $Y$, so there are **2 generators**, which means $k=2$.\n\nPlugging these into Witt's formula, we need to calculate:\n\n$L_2(10) = \\frac{1}{10} \\sum_{d|10} \\mu(d) 2^{10/d}$\n\n**Step 5: Perform the Calculation**\n\nFirst, we need to find all the divisors of $n=10$ and the corresponding values of the Möbius function $\\mu(d)$.\n\n*   **Divisors of 10**: The positive divisors of 10 are $d = 1, 2, 5, 10$.\n\n*   **Möbius Function $\\mu(d)$**:\n    *   $\\mu(1) = 1$\n    *   $\\mu(2) = -1$ (since 2 is a single prime)\n    *   $\\mu(5) = -1$ (since 5 is a single prime)\n    *   $\\mu(10) = \\mu(2 \\cdot 5) = (-1)^2 = 1$ (since 10 is a product of 2 distinct primes)\n\nNow, we can compute each term in the summation $\\sum_{d|10} \\mu(d) 2^{10/d}$:\n\n*   For $d=1$: $\\mu(1) \\cdot 2^{10/1} = 1 \\cdot 2^{10} = 1 \\cdot 1024 = 1024$\n*   For $d=2$: $\\mu(2) \\cdot 2^{10/2} = (-1) \\cdot 2^{5} = -1 \\cdot 32 = -32$\n*   For $d=5$: $\\mu(5) \\cdot 2^{10/5} = (-1) \\cdot 2^{2} = -1 \\cdot 4 = -4$\n*   For $d=10$: $\\mu(10) \\cdot 2^{10/10} = 1 \\cdot 2^{1} = 1 \\cdot 2 = 2$\n\nNext, we sum these values:\nSum = $1024 + (-32) + (-4) + 2 = 1024 - 32 - 4 + 2 = 990$.\n\nFinally, we divide the sum by $n=10$:\n$L_2(10) = \\frac{1}{10} \\times 990 = 99$.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Correct Interpretation**: The most crucial point is realizing that \"number of nonzero coefficients\" is not a trivial question about specific coefficient values vanishing by chance. It refers to the number of fundamental building blocks (basis elements) of that order, which is a structural property of the free Lie algebra.\n2.  **Witt's Formula**: You must use the correct formula and understand each component.\n3.  **Möbius Function**: Be careful when calculating $\\mu(d)$. Remember that if $d$ has a squared prime factor (e.g., $\\mu(4)=0$, $\\mu(12)=0$), the value is 0. This doesn't apply to the divisors of 10, as 10 is square-free.\n4.  **Arithmetic**: Ensure all calculations, especially powers and the final summation, are performed accurately.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nThe number of nonzero coefficients of order 10 in the BCH expansion is the dimension of the degree-10 subspace of the free Lie algebra on two generators, $L_2(10)$. Using Witt's formula:\n$L_2(10) = \\frac{1}{10} \\left( \\mu(1)2^{10} + \\mu(2)2^{5} + \\mu(5)2^{2} + \\mu(10)2^{1} \\right)$\n$L_2(10) = \\frac{1}{10} \\left( 1 \\cdot 1024 - 1 \\cdot 32 - 1 \\cdot 4 + 1 \\cdot 2 \\right)$\n$L_2(10) = \\frac{1}{10} \\left( 1024 - 32 - 4 + 2 \\right)$\n$L_2(10) = \\frac{1}{10} (990)$\n$L_2(10) = 99$\n\n<<<99>>>"
