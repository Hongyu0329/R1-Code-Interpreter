    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the book of manners preserved alongside Sir Launfal.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the specific version of \"Sir Launfal\" and its manuscript.** The question most likely refers to the most famous Middle English version of the story, the poem *Sir Launfal* by Thomas Chestre, written around the late 14th century. This poem survives in a single, unique manuscript: **Cotton MS Caligula A.ii**, which is housed in the British Library. Therefore, to answer the question, we must analyze the other contents of this specific manuscript.\n\n2.  **Examine the contents of the manuscript.** Cotton MS Caligula A.ii is a miscellany, meaning it is a collection of various unrelated works bound together. It contains a significant number of Middle English romances and other poems. The major works in this manuscript include *Sir Launfal*, *The Erl of Tolous*, *Lybeaus Desconus*, *Emar√©*, and *Sir Gowther*, among others.\n\n3.  **Search for a \"book of manners\" within the manuscript's contents.** A book of manners, also known as a courtesy book or book of nurture, is a text that gives instruction on etiquette, social conduct, and morals. Looking through the list of contents for Cotton MS Caligula A.ii, there is no work that is explicitly and entirely a book of manners by title. The works are predominantly romances.\n\n4.  **Identify the most likely candidate through closer inspection.** Although there is no dedicated courtesy book, one of the romances in the manuscript is famous for containing a long section that functions exactly like one. This romance is ***The Squyr of Lowe Degre***.\n\n5.  **Analyze why *The Squyr of Lowe Degre* fits the description.**\n    *   **The Text:** *The Squyr of Lowe Degre* is a romance about a squire who loves a king's daughter.\n    *   **The \"Book of Manners\" Section:** A very famous and lengthy passage in the poem (over 80 lines long) consists of the King of Hungary giving his daughter detailed instructions on how she should conduct herself and what her daily routine should be while she waits for her squire to return.\n    *   **Specific Instructions:** The king advises her on proper pastimes like reading romances, listening to music, walking in the garden, engaging in falconry, and speaking with her ladies-in-waiting. He outlines an ideal of genteel, courtly female behavior.\n    *   **Scholarly View:** This specific section is widely recognized by scholars as a \"courtesy book passage\" or a mini-manual of instruction for a princess, embedded within the larger narrative of the romance.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **The Manuscript is Key:** The answer depends entirely on knowing the specific manuscript where *Sir Launfal* is preserved.\n*   **Broad Definition:** The question uses the term \"book of manners,\" but the answer is not a standalone book. It is a work of another genre (romance) that contains a significant and distinct section fulfilling the function of a book of manners.\n*   **The Correct Work:** It is important not to confuse *The Squyr of Lowe Degre* with other didactic or religious poems in the manuscript, such as *Ypotis*, which is more of a catechism (religious instruction) than a guide to social conduct.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe poem *Sir Launfal* by Thomas Chestre is preserved in the manuscript Cotton MS Caligula A.ii. In this same manuscript is the romance *The Squyr of Lowe Degre*, which is notable for containing a long, detailed section that serves as a guide to courtly conduct for a noble lady, effectively functioning as a \"book of manners.\"\n\n<<<The Squyr of Lowe Degre>>>"
