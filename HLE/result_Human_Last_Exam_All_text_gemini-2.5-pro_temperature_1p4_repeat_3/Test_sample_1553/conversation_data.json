    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the key elements of the question.**\n*   **Book:** \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość\" (Perfect Imperfection)\n*   **Author:** Jacek Dukaj\n*   **Task:** Identify the name of the character that the main character marries.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the main character of the novel.**\n*   The protagonist of \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość\" is Adam Zamoyski, a man from the 21st century who is resurrected in the distant future.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the main character's relationships.**\n*   Throughout the novel, Adam Zamoyski's most significant and complex relationship is with a post-human entity. This character acts as his guide, protector, and partner in a world he barely understands.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the character Adam Zamoyski \"marries\".**\n*   The character he forms this profound bond with is named Angelica.\n*   **Careful Point:** The term \"marriage\" in the context of this far-future, post-human science fiction novel is not a traditional ceremony. It represents a deeper, more metaphysical union. Adam and Angelica's consciousnesses and existences become inextricably linked, culminating in a form of fusion or transcendence together. This is the closest equivalent to marriage within the narrative's framework.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude the analysis.**\n*   Based on the central relationship arc of the novel, the character Adam Zamoyski forms a permanent, life-altering union with is Angelica. Therefore, she is the correct answer to the question.\n\n<<<Angelica>>>"
