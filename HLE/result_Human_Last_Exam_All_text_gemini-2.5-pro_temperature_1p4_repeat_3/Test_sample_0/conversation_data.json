    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which condition of Arrhenius's sixth impossibility theorem is violated by critical-level views.\n\n### Step 1: Understand Critical-Level Views\n\nCritical-level views are a family of theories in population ethics. Their core feature is the postulation of a \"critical level\" of welfare, let's call it `c`.\n\n*   A life is considered a positive contribution to the world's value only if its welfare level (`u`) is **above** this critical level `c`.\n*   A life with welfare below the critical level `c` is considered a negative contribution, even if that person's life is worth living (i.e., their welfare `u` is positive, `u > 0`).\n*   For example, in a simple total version, the value of a population is calculated as the sum of `(u_i - c)` for every person `i`.\n*   **Key Implication:** Adding a person with a positive welfare level `u` such that `0 < u < c` will *decrease* the total value of the population, making the outcome worse. This is the most distinctive and controversial feature of these views.\n\n### Step 2: Understand the Conditions of Arrhenius's Sixth Impossibility Theorem\n\nArrhenius's sixth impossibility theorem shows that no single theory can simultaneously satisfy a set of plausible-sounding ethical principles (axioms). Let's analyze the conditions provided in the answer choices.\n\n*   **A. Egalitarian Dominance:** This principle states that if you have two populations of the same size, and every person in population A has higher welfare than every person in population B, then population A is better than B.\n    *   *Analysis for Critical-Level Views:* This is satisfied. If everyone in A has welfare `u_A` and everyone in B has welfare `u_B`, with `u_A > u_B`, then the total value `N(u_A - c)` will be greater than `N(u_B - c)`.\n\n*   **B. General Non-Extreme Priority:** This is a complex principle about giving some priority to the worse-off, stating that benefits to the well-off can't always outweigh benefits to the badly-off. While relevant to population ethics, it's not the principle most directly and characteristically violated by the fundamental structure of critical-level views.\n\n*   **C. Non-Elitism:** This principle states that there is no \"elite\" welfare level so high that a population at that level is always better than any larger population at a slightly lower level. In other words, for any two high welfare levels, a sufficiently large population at the slightly lower level can be better.\n    *   *Analysis for Critical-Level Views:* This is satisfied. A very large population `m` at welfare `u-ε` can have a greater total value `m(u-ε-c)` than a smaller population `n` at welfare `u`, which has value `n(u-c)`.\n\n*   **D. Weak Non-Sadism:** This is a very basic and weak principle. It states that, all else equal, adding a person with negative welfare (a life of suffering, not worth living) makes the population worse.\n    *   *Analysis for Critical-Level Views:* This is satisfied. If we add a person with negative welfare `u < 0`, the change in value is `(u - c)`. Since `u` is negative and `c` is typically assumed to be non-negative, `(u - c)` is definitely negative. The addition makes the population worse.\n\n*   **E. Weak Quality Addition:** This principle captures the intuition that adding a happy life is a good thing. A standard formulation is: for any existing population, there is a better population that consists of the original people plus one additional person with a life worth living (positive welfare). A related, and violated, concept is the **Mere Addition Principle**, which states that adding a person with a life worth living cannot make a population worse.\n    *   *Analysis for Critical-Level Views:* This is the principle that critical-level views are famous for violating. As explained in Step 1, the central claim of these views is that adding a person with positive welfare `u` *can* make the population worse if `0 < u < c`. This directly contradicts the spirit and common formulations of quality addition principles. While technical versions of the axiom can sometimes be satisfied (by picking an added life with welfare `u > c`), the conceptual violation of the underlying intuition is clear and is the defining feature of the theory.\n\n### Step 3: Conclusion\n\nBy examining each condition, we can see that critical-level views are constructed in a way that satisfies Non-Sadism, Non-Elitism, and Egalitarian Dominance. However, their defining feature is the rejection of the idea that adding any life worth living is at least a neutral act. This places them in direct conflict with principles of quality addition. Therefore, critical-level views violate Weak Quality Addition.\n\n<<<E>>>"
