    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Definitions\n\n*   **Continuum:** A continuum is a compact, connected metric space.\n*   **Nondegenerate Continuum:** A continuum that consists of more than one point. Examples include a line segment (like $[0,1]$), a circle, a square, or more exotic spaces like the pseudo-arc.\n*   **Composant:** For a given point `p` in a continuum `X`, the composant of `p`, denoted `C(p)`, is the set of all points `q` in `X` such that `p` and `q` are contained in some proper subcontinuum of `X`. (A proper subcontinuum of `X` is a subcontinuum that is not equal to `X` itself).\n    *   The set of all composants of a continuum `X` forms a partition of `X`. That is, every point belongs to exactly one composant.\n*   **Product of two continua:** Given two continua `X` and `Y`, their product `X × Y` is the Cartesian product of the sets `X` and `Y`, endowed with the product topology. If `X` and `Y` are continua, their product `X × Y` is also a continuum.\n\n### Step 2: Listing Careful Points and Key Theorems\n\n1.  **Number of Composants:** A fundamental theorem by S. Mazurkiewicz states that any continuum `X` has either **1** composant or **c** composants, where **c** is the cardinality of the continuum ($c = 2^{\\aleph_0}$).\n    *   If a continuum has only one composant, it is called **decomposable**. This means it can be written as the union of two of its proper subcontinua. For example, the interval $[0,1]$ is decomposable ($[0,1] = [0, 2/3] \\cup [1/3, 1]$) and has 1 composant.\n    *   If a continuum has **c** composants, it is called **indecomposable**. A classic example of a nondegenerate indecomposable continuum is the **pseudo-arc**.\n\n2.  **Composants of a Product Space:** There is a crucial theorem regarding the composants of a product space. Let `X` and `Y` be continua.\n    *   **Theorem:** The composant of a point `(x, y)` in the product space `X × Y` is the Cartesian product of the composant of `x` in `X` and the composant of `y` in `Y`.\n    *   Symbolically: `C_{X×Y}((x, y)) = C_X(x) × C_Y(y)`.\n\n3.  **Number of Composants of a Product:** An immediate consequence of the theorem above is that the number of distinct composants in `X × Y` is the product of the number of composants in `X` and the number of composants in `Y`.\n    *   Let `κ(Z)` denote the number of composants of a continuum `Z`. Then `κ(X × Y) = κ(X) ⋅ κ(Y)`, where the multiplication is cardinal multiplication.\n\n### Step 3: Step-by-Step Analysis to Find the Answer\n\nOur goal is to find the largest possible value for `κ(X × Y)`, where `X` and `Y` are nondegenerate continua.\n\n1.  From the formula `κ(X × Y) = κ(X) ⋅ κ(Y)`, we see that to maximize the number of composants in the product, we must maximize the number of composants in each factor space, `X` and `Y`.\n\n2.  According to the theorem on the number of composants (Step 2, Point 1), the number of composants for any continuum is either 1 or **c**.\n\n3.  Therefore, the maximum possible value for `κ(X)` is **c**, and the maximum possible value for `κ(Y)` is **c**.\n\n4.  To achieve this maximum, we need to choose `X` and `Y` to be indecomposable continua. Since the problem requires `X` and `Y` to be nondegenerate, we can choose them to be, for example, two pseudo-arcs. The pseudo-arc is a nondegenerate indecomposable continuum, so it has **c** composants.\n\n5.  With these choices, we can calculate the maximum number of composants for the product space:\n    `κ(X × Y) = κ(X) ⋅ κ(Y) = c ⋅ c`\n\n6.  Now we perform the cardinal arithmetic. The cardinal **c** is equal to $2^{\\aleph_0}$.\n    `c ⋅ c = 2^{\\aleph_0} ⋅ 2^{\\aleph_0} = 2^{\\aleph_0 + \\aleph_0}`\n    Since $\\aleph_0 + \\aleph_0 = \\aleph_0$, we have:\n    `2^{\\aleph_0} = c`\n\n7.  Thus, the maximum number of composants is **c**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe largest possible number of composants of the product of two nondegenerate continua is achieved when both continua are indecomposable. In this case, each has **c** composants, and their product has `c ⋅ c = c` composants.\n\n<<<c>>>"
