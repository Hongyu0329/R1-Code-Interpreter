    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Subject:** A specific law (\"statute\").\n    *   **Jurisdiction:** The \"modern State of Israel\" (i.e., legislation passed by the Knesset since 1948).\n    *   **Key Concept:** The statute must be the *first* to *explicitly introduce* the legal concept of \"good faith\" (in Hebrew, \"תום לב\" - *tom lev*).\n    *   **Formatting Constraints:** Do not include \"the\" or the year in the final answer.\n\n2.  **Initial Brainstorming and Common Knowledge:**\n    *   The most famous Israeli law regarding \"good faith\" is the Contracts (General Part) Law of 1973. Sections 12 and 39 of this law elevated \"good faith\" to a general, overarching principle in contract law. However, the question asks for the *first* statute, not the most famous or most impactful one. This suggests the answer likely predates 1973.\n\n3.  **Chronological Search of Israeli Legislation:**\n    *   The establishment of the State of Israel in 1948 did not create a legal vacuum. The Law and Administration Ordinance, 1948, kept the existing law (a mix of Ottoman and British Mandate law) in force. The concept of good faith existed in these prior legal systems, but the question is about its introduction into a statute passed by the Israeli Knesset.\n    *   We must look for original Knesset legislation that uses the explicit term \"good faith\". Let's examine major civil law codifications in chronological order.\n    *   **Sale Law, 1968:** Section 34 of this law, which deals with the \"market overt\" rule (*takkanat ha-shuk*), states that a buyer acquires good title to goods if they were purchased \"in good faith\". So, we have an instance in 1968.\n    *   **Land Law, 1969:** Section 10 of this law protects a person who acquires a right to registered land in reliance, in \"good faith\", on the registry. This is from 1969, which is later than the Sale Law.\n    *   **Defamation (Prohibition) Law, 1965:** This is a major original piece of Israeli legislation. Section 15 provides a list of defenses against a defamation claim, all of which are conditional on the publication being made \"in good faith\" (*be-tom lev*). This statute predates both the Sale Law (1968) and the Land Law (1969).\n\n4.  **Searching for Earlier Statutes (pre-1965):**\n    *   The next step is to determine if any Knesset statute before 1965 explicitly used the term \"good faith\".\n    *   A key area to check is legislation that involved the re-enactment or consolidation of British Mandate law into Israeli law. These were known as \"New Version\" (*Nusach Hadash*) laws.\n    *   **Bills of Exchange Ordinance [New Version], 1957:** This law is a Knesset-enacted Hebrew version of the original 1929 Mandate-era Ordinance. Section 28(b) of this statute defines a \"holder in due course\" as someone who took a bill of exchange, among other things, \"in good faith\" (*be-tom lev*).\n    *   This statute was passed by the Knesset in 1957.\n\n5.  **Comparing Candidates and Final Conclusion:**\n    *   We have a clear timeline:\n        *   **1957:** Bills of Exchange Ordinance [New Version]\n        *   **1965:** Defamation (Prohibition) Law\n        *   **1968:** Sale Law\n        *   **1969:** Land Law\n        *   **1973:** Contracts (General Part) Law\n    *   The question asks for the first statute *in the modern State of Israel*. Although the Bills of Exchange Ordinance [New Version] was based on a Mandate law, its enactment in 1957 makes it a statute of the State of Israel. It is the earliest law passed by the Knesset on this list that explicitly uses the term \"good faith\". Therefore, it is the correct answer.\n\n### Careful Points to Note:\n\n*   **\"Introduce\" vs. \"Originate\":** The question asks which statute was the first to \"introduce\" the concept. This should be interpreted as the first time the term appeared in a statute passed by the Knesset, not the first time the concept appeared in the legal system of the land (as it pre-existed in Mandate law).\n*   **\"Statute\":** A \"New Version\" (*Nusach Hadash*) of a Mandate-era ordinance is considered a full-fledged Knesset statute.\n*   **\"Explicitly\":** The statute must use the specific words \"good faith\" (\"תום לב\"), not just contain principles that could be interpreted as such. The Bills of Exchange Ordinance [New Version], 1957, meets this criterion.\n*   **Excluding the Year:** The final answer must not contain the year \"1957\" or the word \"the\". The designation \"[New Version]\" is part of the official title and is necessary to identify the specific law.\n\n<<<Bills of Exchange Ordinance [New Version]>>>"
