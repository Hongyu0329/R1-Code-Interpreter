    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the song.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Musical Question\n\nThe question asks for a song by The Beatles with a very specific opening chord progression: \"a chord jump from the tonic to the minor fifth chord.\" Let's break down these musical terms:\n\n*   **Tonic Chord (I):** This is the \"home\" chord of a song's key. It's the chord built on the first note of the scale. For example, in the key of C major, the tonic chord is C major.\n*   **Fifth Chord (V):** This is the chord built on the fifth note of the scale. In a major key, this chord is naturally a major chord (also called the dominant chord). For example, in the key of C major, the fifth note is G, and the V chord is G major.\n*   **Minor Fifth Chord (v):** This is the crucial part of the question. It specifies that the fifth chord should be *minor*. So, instead of the naturally occurring major V chord, we are looking for a minor v chord. Using our C major example, this would be a G minor chord. This is a \"borrowed\" chord, typically from the parallel minor key (C minor in this case), and it creates a very distinct, often melancholic or sophisticated, sound.\n*   **Chord Jump / Starts with:** The progression must happen at the very beginning of the song, as a direct movement from the first chord (I) to the second (v).\n\nSo, we are looking for a Beatles song that starts with the progression **I → v**.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Potential Beatles Songs\n\nLet's examine the intros of several famous Beatles songs to see if they match this pattern.\n\n*   **\"Help!\"**: The key is A major. The tonic (I) is A major. The minor fifth (v) would be E minor. The song starts with A major, but the second chord is C# minor (iii), not E minor. So, this is not the one.\n*   **\"I Want to Hold Your Hand\"**: The key is G major. The tonic (I) is G major. The minor fifth (v) would be D minor. The song starts with a progression of G → D → Em → C (I → V → vi → IV). The second chord is the major fifth (D major), not the minor fifth. So, this is not the one.\n*   **\"Yesterday\"**: The key is F major. The tonic (I) is F major. The minor fifth (v) would be C minor. The song's first two chords are F major → E minor 7th. This is I → viim7, not I → v. So, this is not the one.\n*   **\"In My Life\"**: The key is A major. The tonic (I) is A major. The minor fifth (v) would be E minor. The opening guitar riff is played over an A chord followed by an E chord. This is a I → V progression (A major to E major), not I → v. So, this is not the one.\n\n### Step 3: Identify the Correct Song\n\nLet's consider the song **\"Michelle\"** from the album *Rubber Soul*.\n\n*   **Key:** The main verse (\"Michelle, ma belle...\") is in the key of **F major**.\n*   **Tonic (I):** The tonic chord is **F major**.\n*   **Minor Fifth (v):** The fifth note of the F major scale is C. The standard major V chord would be C major. The *minor fifth* chord (v) is therefore **C minor**.\n*   **Analysis of the opening:** The song begins with a short instrumental intro, but the main musical and lyrical theme starts with the famous first line.\n    *   The chord played on the word \"**Mi-chelle**\" is **F major (I)**.\n    *   The chord immediately following on the word \"**belle**\" is **C minor (v)**.\n\nThis progression, **F major → C minor**, is a perfect match for the **I → v** pattern described in the question. This specific chord change is a hallmark of the song's sophisticated, French-influenced sound.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe Beatles song that starts its main theme with a chord jump from the tonic (I) to the minor fifth (v) is \"Michelle\".\n\n<<<Michelle>>>"
