    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understand the Core Question:** The question asks to identify a peptide sequence that is known or very likely to bind to an integrin receptor. Integrins are a major class of cell adhesion receptors.\n2.  **Identify the Key Recognition Motif:** A well-established and widely known recognition motif for a large subset of integrins is the tripeptide sequence **Arg-Gly-Asp**, abbreviated as **RGD**. All five answer choices contain this core RGD sequence at their N-terminus. This indicates that the deciding factor for binding is not the presence of the RGD motif itself, but the nature of the amino acids that follow it (the C-terminal flanking sequence).\n3.  **Analyze the Role of Flanking Sequences:** The amino acids surrounding the RGD core are critical. They influence the conformation of the peptide and provide additional contact points with the integrin receptor, thereby determining the binding affinity and specificity (i.e., which specific integrin subtype it binds to). To answer the question, we should look for a sequence that mimics a known natural ligand of an integrin.\n4.  **Recall or Research Natural Integrin Ligands:** The most famous RGD-containing protein in the extracellular matrix (ECM) is **fibronectin**. The specific sequence in fibronectin that is recognized by integrins (such as α5β1 and αvβ3) is **-Gly-Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser-Pro-** (short form: GRGDSP). The peptide GRGDSP has been extensively studied and is a standard tool in cell biology to study integrin-mediated adhesion.\n5.  **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**\n    *   **A. RGDMAA:** The sequence `MAA` (Met-Ala-Ala) is not characteristic of the flanking region in fibronectin or other common RGD-containing ECM proteins like vitronectin. While it could potentially bind, it is not a classic or highly probable sequence.\n    *   **B. RGDSPSS:** This peptide contains the sequence **RGDSP**. This directly corresponds to the core binding region of fibronectin (`...RGDSP...`). The Ser-Pro (`SP`) dipeptide immediately following RGD is particularly important for presenting the RGD loop in a conformation that is favorable for binding to several integrins. The addition of two more Serine residues (`SS`) at the end is unlikely to prevent binding. Because this sequence is derived from the canonical binding site of a major natural ligand (fibronectin), it is highly likely to bind integrin receptors in an in vitro assay.\n    *   **C. RGDLTTP:** The flanking sequence `LTTP` (Leu-Thr-Thr-Pro) does not match the well-known fibronectin sequence. While proline can be structurally important, this specific combination is not a widely recognized integrin-binding motif.\n    *   **D. RGDQVSK:** The flanking sequence `QVSK` (Gln-Val-Ser-Lys) is also not the canonical sequence from fibronectin or vitronectin.\n    *   **E. RGDARGG:** The flanking sequence `ARGG` (Ala-Arg-Gly-Gly) introduces a second arginine residue close to the RGD motif. This additional positive charge could potentially interfere with the specific electrostatic interactions required for binding to the integrin pocket. It is not a sequence from a common natural ligand.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis, the peptide **RGDSPSS** is the most likely candidate to bind an integrin receptor. Its sequence `RGDSP` is a core part of the binding site in fibronectin, one of the primary natural ligands for RGD-dependent integrins. This makes it a peptide that has either been directly tested or is highly predicted to be active based on decades of research on the GRGDSP peptide.\n\n<<<B>>>"
