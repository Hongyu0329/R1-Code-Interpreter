    "To determine the number of pieces needed to represent the number $\\frac{13}{16}$ in red-blue-Hackenbush, we follow a step-by-step analysis based on the standard representation of dyadic rational numbers in this game.\n\n**Step 1: Express the number in its binary form.**\nThe value of a Hackenbush game can be decomposed into a sum of simpler games. For a dyadic rational number (a fraction with a power of 2 in the denominator), the most efficient representation corresponds to its binary expansion.\n\nFirst, we convert the numerator, 13, to binary:\n$13 = 8 + 4 + 1 = 1 \\cdot 2^3 + 1 \\cdot 2^2 + 0 \\cdot 2^1 + 1 \\cdot 2^0$\nSo, $13_{10} = 1101_2$.\n\nNow, we find the binary representation of $\\frac{13}{16}$. Since $16 = 2^4$, we divide $1101_2$ by $2^4$, which involves shifting the binary point 4 places to the left:\n$\\frac{13}{16} = 0.1101_2$\n\n**Step 2: Decompose the binary number into a sum of powers of 1/2.**\nThe binary representation $0.1101_2$ translates to the following sum:\n$0.1101_2 = (1 \\times 2^{-1}) + (1 \\times 2^{-2}) + (0 \\times 2^{-3}) + (1 \\times 2^{-4})$\n$\\frac{13}{16} = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{16}$\n\nIn Hackenbush, the game representing this sum is constructed by creating separate game components for each term ($\\frac{1}{2}$, $\\frac{1}{4}$, and $\\frac{1}{16}$) and connecting them all independently to the ground. The total number of pieces will be the sum of the pieces used for each component.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the structure and number of pieces for each component.**\nThe canonical Hackenbush representation for a positive fraction of the form $\\frac{1}{2^n}$ (where $n \\ge 1$) is a vertical stack of edges. Let's analyze the structure:\n\n*   The game with value $\\frac{1}{2}$ is $\\{0 | 1\\}$. This is constructed with a single red edge placed on top of a single blue edge, which is connected to the ground.\n*   The game with value $\\frac{1}{4}$ is $\\{0 | \\frac{1}{2}\\}$. This is constructed by placing a red edge on top of the game for $\\frac{1}{2}$. This results in a stack of two red edges on top of one blue edge.\n*   Generalizing, the game with value $\\frac{1}{2^n}$ is $\\{0 | \\frac{1}{2^{n-1}}\\}$. This is constructed as a stack of **$n$ red edges on top of a single blue edge**.\n\nThe number of pieces required to represent $\\frac{1}{2^n}$ is therefore $n$ (for the red edges) + 1 (for the blue edge), which equals **$n+1$ pieces**.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the number of pieces for each term in our sum.**\nWe apply the formula from Step 3 to each component of our number, $\\frac{13}{16}$.\n\n*   **For the $\\frac{1}{2}$ term:**\n    This is $\\frac{1}{2^1}$, so $n=1$.\n    Number of pieces = $1 + 1 = 2$. (This is the stack: 1 red on 1 blue).\n\n*   **For the $\\frac{1}{4}$ term:**\n    This is $\\frac{1}{2^2}$, so $n=2$.\n    Number of pieces = $2 + 1 = 3$. (This is the stack: 2 red on 1 blue).\n\n*   **For the $\\frac{1}{16}$ term:**\n    This is $\\frac{1}{2^4}$, so $n=4$.\n    Number of pieces = $4 + 1 = 5$. (This is the stack: 4 red on 1 blue).\n\n**Step 5: Sum the pieces to find the total.**\nThe total number of pieces is the sum of the pieces for each component game.\nTotal Pieces = (Pieces for $\\frac{1}{2}$) + (Pieces for $\\frac{1}{4}$) + (Pieces for $\\frac{1}{16}$)\nTotal Pieces = $2 + 3 + 5$\nTotal Pieces = $10$\n\nTherefore, 10 pieces are needed to represent the number $\\frac{13}{16}$ in red-blue-Hackenbush.\n\n<<<10>>>"
