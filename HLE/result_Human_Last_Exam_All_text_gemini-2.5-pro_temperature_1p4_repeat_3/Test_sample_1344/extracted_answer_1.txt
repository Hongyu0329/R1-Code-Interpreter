The optimal combination is a single-site catalyst consisting of **Zirconium (Zr)**, grafted onto a **Sulfated Zirconia (SZ) support**. This system is best prepared using a simple, thermally stable alkyl precursor like tetraneopentylzirconium. No complex, synthesized organic ligand is required, as the superacidic support itself acts to create and stabilize the highly electrophilic metal center needed for both reactions.
