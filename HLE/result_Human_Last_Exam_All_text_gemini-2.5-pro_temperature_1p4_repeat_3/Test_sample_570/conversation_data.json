    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the minimal area of the convex domain.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Condition on the Convex Domain\n\nLet `K` be a convex domain in the plane. The set of lines is `L = {l_{p,q} : px + qy = 1, p, q \\in \\mathbb{Z}, \\gcd(p, q) = 1}`.\nThe condition is that `K` must intersect every line `l \\in L`.\n\nA convex set `K` intersects a line `u \\cdot x = c` if and only if the set of values `{u \\cdot x : x \\in K}` contains `c`. This means `inf_{x \\in K} (u \\cdot x) \\le c \\le sup_{x \\in K} (u \\cdot x)`.\n\nLet `h_K(u) = sup_{x \\in K} (u \\cdot x)` be the support function of `K`. The infimum can be expressed as `inf_{x \\in K} (u \\cdot x) = -sup_{x \\in K} (-u \\cdot x) = -h_K(-u)`.\n\nFor any line `px+qy=1` in `L`, let `u = (p, q)`. The condition is:\n`-h_K(-u) \\le 1 \\le h_K(u)` for all `u=(p,q)` with `\\gcd(p,q)=1`.\n\nLet `P` be the set of primitive integer lattice points, i.e., `P = {(p, q) \\in \\mathbb{Z}^2 : \\gcd(p, q) = 1}`. The set `P` is centrally symmetric, meaning if `u \\in P`, then `-u \\in P`.\n\nThe condition must hold for all `u \\in P`.\nSo, for any `u \\in P`:\n1.  `h_K(u) \\ge 1`\n2.  `h_K(-u) \\ge -1`\n\nNow consider the line corresponding to `-u = (-p, -q)`. Since `\\gcd(-p, -q) = \\gcd(p, q) = 1`, `-u` is also in `P`. Applying the intersection condition to the line `-px - qy = 1`, we get:\n1.  `h_K(-u) \\ge 1`\n2.  `h_K(-(-u)) \\ge -1 \\implies h_K(u) \\ge -1`\n\nCombining these conditions, for any `u \\in P`, the support function of `K` must satisfy:\n`h_K(u) \\ge 1` and `h_K(-u) \\ge 1`.\n\n### Step 2: Symmetrization Argument\n\nLet `K` be any convex domain satisfying the condition. Consider the set `K_s = K \\cap (-K)`.\n*   `K_s` is a convex set.\n*   `K_s` is centrally symmetric with respect to the origin.\n*   By the Brunn-Minkowski inequality, `Area(K_s) \\le Area(K)`.\n\nLet's check if `K_s` also satisfies the required conditions. The support function of `K_s` is `h_{K_s}(u) = \\min(h_K(u), h_{-K}(u)) = \\min(h_K(u), h_K(-u))`.\nSince `K` is a solution, we know `h_K(u) \\ge 1` and `h_K(-u) \\ge 1` for all `u \\in P`.\nTherefore, `h_{K_s}(u) = \\min(h_K(u), h_K(-u)) \\ge \\min(1, 1) = 1`.\nFor a centrally symmetric set `K_s`, `h_{K_s}(-u) = h_{K_s}(u)`, so `h_{K_s}(-u) \\ge 1` is also true.\nThis shows that `K_s` is also a valid domain. Since `Area(K_s) \\le Area(K)`, the minimal area will be achieved by a centrally symmetric set.\nSo, we can restrict our search to centrally symmetric convex domains `K`. For such a `K`, the condition simplifies to `h_K(u) \\ge 1` for all `u \\in P`.\n\n### Step 3: The Dual Problem\n\nFor a centrally symmetric convex body `K`, we can relate its properties to its polar dual, `K^*`. The polar dual is defined as `K^* = \\{y \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 : x \\cdot y \\le 1 \\text{ for all } x \\in K\\}`. `K^*` is also a centrally symmetric convex body.\n\nThe support function of `K` is the gauge function of `K^*`. For `u \\in \\mathbb{R}^2`, `h_K(u) = \\inf\\{\\lambda > 0 : u \\in \\lambda K^*\\}`.\nThe condition `h_K(u) \\ge 1` for all `u \\in P` means that for any primitive lattice point `u`, `u` cannot be in the interior of `K^*`.\nSo, the problem is transformed into finding a centrally symmetric convex set `K^*` such that `int(K^*) \\cap P = \\emptyset`.\n\nA key fact is that if a non-zero integer lattice point `(m,n)` is in `int(K^*)`, then letting `d=\\gcd(m,n)`, the primitive point `(m/d, n/d)` lies on the segment from the origin to `(m,n)` and thus must also be in `int(K^*)`. Therefore, `int(K^*) \\cap P = \\emptyset` is equivalent to `int(K^*) \\cap (\\mathbb{Z}^2 \\setminus \\{0\\}) = \\emptyset`.\n\n### Step 4: Maximizing the Area of the Dual Body\n\nWe want to find the minimal `Area(K)`. The Mahler product for centrally symmetric convex bodies in `\\mathbb{R}^2` states that `Area(K) \\cdot Area(K^*) \\ge 8`.\nTo minimize `Area(K)`, we must maximize `Area(K^*)`.\n\nSo the problem becomes: Find the maximum area of a centrally symmetric convex set `K^*` whose interior contains no non-zero integer lattice points.\nBy Minkowski's theorem on convex bodies, any centrally symmetric convex set `C` with `Area(C) > 4` must contain a non-zero integer lattice point in its interior.\nTherefore, our `K^*` must satisfy `Area(K^*) \\le 4`.\nThe maximum possible area for `K^*` is 4.\n\n### Step 5: Finding the Minimal Area and the Corresponding Domain\n\nUsing the maximal area of the dual body, we can find the lower bound for the area of `K`:\n`Area(K) \\ge 8 / Area(K^*) \\ge 8 / 4 = 2`.\nSo the minimal possible area is at least 2.\n\nTo show that this minimum is achievable, we need to find a set `K` whose area is exactly 2. This will happen if we can find a `K^*` with `Area(K^*) = 4` for which the Mahler product equality `Area(K)Area(K^*)=8` holds. Equality holds for parallelograms.\n\nLet's choose `K^*` to be the square `[-1, 1] \\times [-1, 1]`.\n*   It is a centrally symmetric convex set (a parallelogram).\n*   Its interior is `(-1, 1) \\times (-1, 1)`, which contains no non-zero integer points.\n*   Its area is `2 \\times 2 = 4`.\n\nNow we find the corresponding `K = (K^*)^*`.\n`K = \\{ (x, y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 : p x + q y \\le 1 \\text{ for all } (p,q) \\in K^* \\}`.\nFor `K^* = [-1, 1] \\times [-1, 1]`, this becomes `sup_{p \\in [-1,1], q \\in [-1,1]} (px + qy) \\le 1`.\nThe supremum is `|x| + |y|`. So, `K` is the set `\\{ (x, y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 : |x| + |y| \\le 1 \\}`.\n\nThis set `K` is a square with vertices at `(1,0), (0,1), (-1,0), (0,-1)`.\n*   It is a centrally symmetric convex set (a parallelogram).\n*   Its area is `\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot d_1 \\cdot d_2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 = 2`.\n\nWe have found a valid convex domain with area 2, and we have proved that the minimal area must be at least 2. Therefore, the minimal area is 2.\n\nFinal check: The support function of `K = \\{ (x, y) : |x| + |y| \\le 1 \\}` is `h_K(p, q) = \\max(|p|, |q|)`. For any coprime integers `(p, q)`, we have `(p,q) \\neq (0,0)`. If, for example, `p \\neq 0`, then `|p| \\ge 1`, so `\\max(|p|, |q|) \\ge 1`. Thus, the condition `h_K(u) \\ge 1` for all `u \\in P` is satisfied.\n\n>>>2"
