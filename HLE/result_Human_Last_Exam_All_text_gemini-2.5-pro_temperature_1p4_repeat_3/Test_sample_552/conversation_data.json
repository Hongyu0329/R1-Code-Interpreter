    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Question:** The user wants to know whose lectures Albert Einstein cited in his specific 1905 paper about Brownian motion.\n\n2.  **Identify the Specific Paper:** The paper in question is one of Einstein's four \"Annus Mirabilis\" (Miracle Year) papers. Its title is \"Über die von der molekularkinetischen Theorie der Wärme geforderte Bewegung von in ruhenden Flüssigkeiten suspendierten Teilchen\" (\"On the Motion of Small Particles Suspended in a Stationary Liquid, as Required by the Molecular-Kinetic Theory of Heat\").\n\n3.  **Examine the Paper for Citations:** The first and most critical step is to analyze the citations within this specific scientific paper. A key historical and academic point about Einstein's 1905 paper on Brownian motion is that it is famous for containing **no citations or references** to the work of other scientists. He did not cite Robert Brown (who first observed the phenomenon), nor did he cite other physicists who had worked on the theory.\n\n4.  **Consider Potential Ambiguity (A Careful Point):** The question asks \"Whose lectures...\", which implies that there is a specific person to be named. A strictly literal answer would be \"no one.\" However, this might be an overly pedantic interpretation, as the question could be slightly imprecise and refer to Einstein's broader work on the subject in 1905.\n\n5.  **Analyze Closely Related Work from 1905:** In the same year, Einstein also completed his PhD thesis, titled \"Eine neue Bestimmung der Moleküldimensionen\" (\"A New Determination of Molecular Dimensions\"). This thesis is thematically and methodologically very closely related to the Brownian motion paper; both works provide a method to determine Avogadro's number and the size of molecules from observable phenomena.\n\n6.  **Examine the Citations in the PhD Thesis:** Unlike the Brownian motion paper, Einstein's PhD thesis *does* contain citations. In this work, he explicitly cites the foundational book by **Ludwig Boltzmann**, titled **\"Vorlesungen über Gastheorie\" (\"Lectures on Gas Theory\")**.\n\n7.  **Synthesize the Findings:**\n    *   Strictly speaking, the 1905 paper on Brownian motion cites no one.\n    *   However, Einstein's closely related PhD thesis from the same year *does* cite the published lectures of a specific physicist.\n    *   Given that the question presumes an answer exists, it is highly probable that it is referring to the explicit citation found in Einstein's contemporary work on the same subject.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on this analysis, the most complete and informative answer acknowledges that while the specific paper on Brownian motion had no citations, his PhD thesis from the same year on a related topic cited the lectures of Ludwig Boltzmann. This is the intended answer to the question about the influences Einstein formally acknowledged in his work from that period.\n\n***\n\n<<<Ludwig Boltzmann>>>"
