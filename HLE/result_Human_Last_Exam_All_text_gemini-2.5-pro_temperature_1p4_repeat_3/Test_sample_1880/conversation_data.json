    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the order of the Galois group for the polynomial $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$ over the field of rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n**Step 1: Check for Irreducibility**\n\nFirst, we determine if the polynomial $f(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. We can use Eisenstein's Criterion.\nLet the prime be $p=2$.\n1.  The prime $p=2$ divides all coefficients except the leading coefficient. The coefficients are (1, 0, 0, 8, 14). Indeed, 2 divides 0, 0, 8, and 14.\n2.  The prime $p=2$ does not divide the leading coefficient, which is 1.\n3.  The square of the prime, $p^2=4$, does not divide the constant term, which is 14.\n\nSince all three conditions are met, by Eisenstein's Criterion, the polynomial $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nThis implies that its Galois group, $G$, is a transitive subgroup of the symmetric group $S_4$. The possible transitive subgroups of $S_4$ are $S_4$ (order 24), $A_4$ (order 12), the dihedral group $D_4$ (order 8), the Klein four-group $V_4$ (order 4), and the cyclic group $C_4$ (order 4).\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Discriminant**\n\nThe nature of the Galois group is closely related to the discriminant of the polynomial. For a quartic of the form $x^4 + cx + d$, the discriminant is given by the formula $\\Delta = -27c^4 + 256d^3$.\nFor our polynomial, $c=8$ and $d=14$.\n$\\Delta = -27(8^4) + 256(14^3)$\n$\\Delta = -27(4096) + 256(2744)$\n$\\Delta = -110592 + 702464$\n$\\Delta = 591872$\n\nThe Galois group $G$ is a subgroup of the alternating group $A_4$ if and only if the discriminant $\\Delta$ is a perfect square of a rational number.\nLet's check if 591872 is a perfect square.\n$\\sqrt{591872} \\approx 769.33$. This is not an integer, so 591872 is not a perfect square.\nThis means that the Galois group $G$ is not a subgroup of $A_4$. This eliminates $A_4$ and $V_4$ as possibilities. The remaining possible groups are $S_4$, $D_4$, and $C_4$.\n\n**Step 3: Find and Analyze the Resolvent Cubic**\n\nThe resolvent cubic for a polynomial $x^4 + ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d$ is given by $g(t) = t^3 - bt^2 + (ac-4d)t - (a^2d - 4bd + c^2)$.\nFor $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$, we have $a=0, b=0, c=8, d=14$.\nSubstituting these values:\n$g(t) = t^3 - (0)t^2 + (0 \\cdot 8 - 4 \\cdot 14)t - (0^2 \\cdot 14 - 4 \\cdot 0 \\cdot 14 + 8^2)$\n$g(t) = t^3 - 56t - 64$\n\nThe Galois group $G$ is $S_4$ if and only if the resolvent cubic $g(t)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. We test for rational roots of $g(t)$ using the Rational Root Theorem. Any rational root must be a divisor of -64. The divisors are $\\pm1, \\pm2, \\pm4, \\pm8, \\ldots$.\nLet's test $t=8$:\n$g(8) = 8^3 - 56(8) - 64 = 512 - 448 - 64 = 0$.\nSince $t=8$ is a rational root, the resolvent cubic $g(t)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nThis eliminates $S_4$ as a possibility. The Galois group $G$ must be either $D_4$ or $C_4$.\n\n**Step 4: Distinguish Between $D_4$ and $C_4$**\n\nTo distinguish between $D_4$ and $C_4$, a standard method is to check if the polynomial $f(x)$ is reducible over the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$.\nWe have $\\Delta = 591872$. Let's simplify its square root:\n$\\sqrt{591872} = \\sqrt{2^{11} \\cdot 17^2} = \\sqrt{2 \\cdot (2^5 \\cdot 17)^2} = (2^5 \\cdot 17)\\sqrt{2} = 544\\sqrt{2}$.\nSo, the field is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta}) = \\mathbb{Q}(544\\sqrt{2}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n\nWe need to determine if $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\nIf $f(x)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, it must factor into two quadratic polynomials (it cannot have a linear factor since it is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$).\nLet the factorization be $(x^2 + Ax + B)(x^2 + Cx + D)$. Expanding this and equating coefficients with $x^4 + 8x + 14$ gives the following system of equations:\n1. $A+C=0 \\implies C=-A$\n2. $B+D+AC = B+D-A^2 = 0 \\implies A^2=B+D$\n3. $AD+BC = A(D-B) = 8$\n4. $BD=14$\n\nFrom these equations, we can derive an equation for $A^2$. The process shows that $y=A^2$ must be a root of the resolvent cubic $g(y) = y^3 - 56y - 64 = 0$.\nThe roots of the resolvent cubic are the possible values for $A^2$. We already found one rational root, $y=8$. The other roots can be found by dividing $g(y)$ by $(y-8)$:\n$y^3 - 56y - 64 = (y-8)(y^2+8y+8) = 0$\nThe roots of $y^2+8y+8=0$ are $y = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64-32}}{2} = -4 \\pm 2\\sqrt{2}$.\nSo, the possible values for $A^2$ are $8$, $-4+2\\sqrt{2}$, and $-4-2\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nFor $f(x)$ to be reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, the coefficient $A$ must be in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. This means $A^2$ must be a square of an element in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\nLet's check the three roots of $g(y)$:\n*   If $A^2 = 8$, then $A = \\pm \\sqrt{8} = \\pm 2\\sqrt{2}$. Since $2\\sqrt{2}$ is in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, this is a valid solution.\n*   If $A^2 = -4+2\\sqrt{2}$, one can show this is not a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. If $(u+v\\sqrt{2})^2 = -4+2\\sqrt{2}$, this leads to $u^4+4u^2+2=0$, which has no rational solution for $u$.\n*   If $A^2 = -4-2\\sqrt{2}$, this number is negative, so its square root is not real and thus not in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n\nSince we found a valid solution for $A$ in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ (namely $A=2\\sqrt{2}$), the polynomial $f(x)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\nThe criterion is as follows:\n*   If $f(x)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$, the Galois group is $D_4$.\n*   If $f(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$, the Galois group is $C_4$.\n\nSince $f(x)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, its Galois group is $D_4$.\n\n**Step 5: Final Answer**\n\nThe Galois group of $x^4 + 8x + 14$ is the dihedral group $D_4$. The question asks for the order of this group. The order of $D_4$ is 8.\n\n<<<8>>>"
