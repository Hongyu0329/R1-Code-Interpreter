    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the problem and define the terms\n\n1.  **Metric Continuum:** A non-empty compact, connected metric space.\n2.  **Indecomposable Continuum:** A continuum $X$ that cannot be expressed as the union of two proper subcontinua. A subcontinuum is a subset that is also a continuum.\n3.  **Hereditary Indecomposable Continuum:** A continuum where every subcontinuum is indecomposable. This is a very strong condition. The pseudo-arc is a classic example.\n4.  **Composant:** In an indecomposable continuum $X$, the composant of a point $p \\in X$, denoted $C(p)$, is the union of all proper subcontinua of $X$ that contain $p$. Key properties of composants in any indecomposable metric continuum are:\n    *   There are uncountably many ($c = 2^{\\aleph_0}$) of them.\n    *   They are pairwise disjoint.\n    *   Their union covers the entire space $X$.\n    *   Each composant is a dense, connected, but meager (first category) subset of $X$.\n5.  **Stone-Cech Compactification:** For a Tychonoff space $Y$, its Stone-Cech compactification $\\beta Y$ is a compact Hausdorff space containing $Y$ as a dense subspace, with the universal property that any continuous map from $Y$ to any compact Hausdorff space $K$ extends uniquely to a continuous map from $\\beta Y$ to $K$.\n6.  **Stone-Cech Remainder:** For a non-compact, locally compact space $Y$, its Stone-Cech remainder is the set $Y^* = \\beta Y \\setminus Y$.\n7.  **The Space in Question:** We are given $X$, a hereditary indecomposable metric continuum, and a point $x \\in X$. We must analyze the Stone-Cech remainder of the space $Y = X \\setminus \\{x\\}$. This space $Y$ is a connected, non-compact, locally compact metric space.\n8.  **The Question:** We need to find the maximum possible number of \"composants\" of the Stone-Cech remainder, $\\beta(X \\setminus \\{x\\}) \\setminus (X \\setminus \\{x\\})$. In this context, \"composants\" refers to the **connected components** of the remainder space.\n\n### Step 2: Relate the Remainder to the Original Space\n\nLet $Y = X \\setminus \\{x\\}$. Since $X$ is a compactification of $Y$, the universal property of the Stone-Cech compactification implies there is a unique continuous, surjective map $f: \\beta Y \\to X$ that extends the inclusion map from $Y$ into $X$.\n\nThis map $f$ acts by \"collapsing\" the remainder $Y^*$ to the single point that was removed. That is:\n*   $f(y) = y$ for all $y \\in Y = X \\setminus \\{x\\}$.\n*   $f(Y^*) = \\{x\\}$.\n\nThe remainder $Y^*$ is therefore the preimage of the point $x$ under this map, i.e., $Y^* = f^{-1}(x)$.\n\n### Step 3: Apply the Key Theorem connecting the Remainder's Components to the Continuum's Composants\n\nA fundamental theorem in continuum theory, due to David P. Bellamy, provides a direct answer to the structure of this remainder.\n\n**Bellamy's Theorem:** Let $M$ be an indecomposable metric continuum and let $p \\in M$. The connected components of the Stone-Cech remainder $\\beta(M \\setminus \\{p\\}) \\setminus (M \\setminus \\{p\\})$ are in a one-to-one correspondence with the composants of $M$.\n\nMore precisely, the components of the remainder are the sets of the form $\\text{cl}_{\\beta(M \\setminus \\{p\\})}(C \\setminus \\{p\\}) \\cap (M \\setminus \\{p\\})^*$, where $C$ is a composant of $M$.\n\n### Step 4: Determine the Number of Composants of the Continuum X\n\nThe next step is to determine how many composants the space $X$ has. The space $X$ is a hereditary indecomposable metric continuum. This is a specific type of indecomposable metric continuum.\n\nA classical result by Stefan Mazurkiewicz states:\n\n**Mazurkiewicz's Theorem:** Any indecomposable metric continuum has exactly $c = 2^{\\aleph_0}$ (the cardinality of the continuum) distinct composants.\n\nSince our space $X$ is a hereditary indecomposable metric continuum, it is, by definition, an indecomposable metric continuum. Therefore, $X$ has exactly $c$ composants.\n\n### Step 5: Synthesize the Results to Find the Final Answer\n\n1.  The problem asks for the number of connected components of the remainder $Y^* = \\beta(X \\setminus \\{x\\}) \\setminus (X \\setminus \\{x\\})$.\n2.  By Bellamy's Theorem, this number is equal to the number of composants of the original continuum $X$.\n3.  By Mazurkiewicz's Theorem, the number of composants of $X$ (being an indecomposable metric continuum) is exactly $c = 2^{\\aleph_0}$.\n4.  This result holds for *any* indecomposable metric continuum $X$ and *any* point $x \\in X$. The property of being *hereditary* indecomposable is a stronger condition, but it does not change the number of composants.\n5.  Therefore, the number of components of the remainder is always $c$.\n6.  The question asks for the *maximum possible* number. Since the number is constant at $c$ for all such spaces, the maximum value is $c$."
