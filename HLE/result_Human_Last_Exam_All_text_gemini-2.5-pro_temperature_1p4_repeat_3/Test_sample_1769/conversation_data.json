    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the hypothetical Modern English word for \"sister\" without Norse influence.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the origin of the current word \"sister\".**\nThe Modern English word \"sister\" comes from the Old Norse word *systir*. This word was introduced into the English language during the Viking Age (roughly 8th to 11th centuries) due to the extensive invasion, settlement, and interaction between the Norse-speaking Vikings and the Old English-speaking Anglo-Saxons, particularly in the region known as the Danelaw. The Norse form eventually replaced the native English word in the standard language.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the original, native Old English word.**\nBefore the Norse influence, the Anglo-Saxons had their own word for a female sibling. This word was **sweostor**. It is important to note that *sweostor* and the Old Norse *systir* are cognates, meaning they both evolved from the same earlier Proto-Germanic word, **swestōr*. This shared origin explains their similarity and why the Norse word could so easily blend into and eventually replace the native one.\n\n**Step 3: Trace the likely linguistic evolution of *sweostor* without external influence.**\nTo predict what *sweostor* would have become, we can observe how other similar native Old English words evolved into Modern English. We need to look at common sound changes that occurred between Old English and Modern English.\n\n*   **Final Syllable Change:** In many Old English kinship terms, the unstressed final `-or` sound was reduced to `-er`.\n    *   Old English *brōþor* became Modern English *brother*.\n    *   Old English *mōdor* became Modern English *mother*.\n    *   Old English *dohtor* became Modern English *daughter*.\n    Following this consistent pattern, the `-or` in *sweostor* would have become `-er*.\n\n*   **Vowel and Consonant Cluster Changes:** The initial part of the word, *sweos-*, would also have undergone simplification.\n    *   The Old English diphthong `eo` often simplified.\n    *   The `sw-` cluster before a back vowel sometimes simplified to just `s-` (e.g., Old English *swā* became *so*).\n    *   In Middle English, two main forms derived from *sweostor* existed in areas with less Norse influence: **swester** and **suster**. The form *suster* was particularly common and was used by prominent writers like Geoffrey Chaucer in \"The Canterbury Tales\".\n\n**Step 4: Synthesize the evidence to determine the most likely modern form.**\nGiven the Middle English evidence, the native word was on a path to become either *swester* or *suster*. The form *suster* represents a more complete phonetic simplification (loss of the 'w' sound), which was very common in the development of English. Given its prevalence in major Middle English literary works, it has a very strong claim to being the form that would have become standard. If it had followed this trajectory into Modern English, it would likely have retained this spelling and pronunciation.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Norse Influence was Key:** The entire premise rests on removing the influence of Old Norse. The current word \"sister\" is a direct loanword from this period.\n2.  **Cognates vs. Loanwords:** While *sweostor* and *systir* are related (cognates), the form we use today was borrowed (a loanword), not natively evolved.\n3.  **Predictable Sound Changes:** The prediction is based on consistent, well-documented sound changes from Old English to Modern English, exemplified by words like \"brother\" and \"mother\".\n4.  **Middle English Evidence:** The existence of the non-Norse form *suster* in influential Middle English texts is the strongest piece of evidence for what the word would have become.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the analysis, the Old English word *sweostor* would have followed a natural path of linguistic evolution similar to other kinship terms. It would have simplified during the Middle English period into the commonly used form *suster*, which would have then been inherited by Modern English.\n\n<<<suster>>>"
