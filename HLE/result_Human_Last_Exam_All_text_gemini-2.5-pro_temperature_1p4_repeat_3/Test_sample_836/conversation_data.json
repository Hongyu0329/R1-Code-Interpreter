    "Answering this question requires delving into the field of reactor noise analysis, which is a key part of understanding the dynamic behavior of systems with fissile material, including critical and subcritical assemblies.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Starting Function: The Generalized Pair Correlation Function**\n    *   In physics, a pair correlation function, `g(r₁, t₁; r₂, t₂)` describes the correlation in the density of particles between two points in space-time, `(r₁, t₁)` and `(r₂, t₂)`. It essentially answers the question: \"Given a particle (a neutron in this case) at position `r₁` at time `t₁`, what is the probability density of finding another particle at `r₂` at time `t₂`?\"\n    *   In a homogeneous and stationary medium, which is a common assumption for analysis, this function depends only on the separation in space `r = r₂ - r₁` and time `t = t₂ - t₁`. So, we can write it as `g(r, t)`.\n    *   This function is \"generalized\" because it considers correlations at two different times, as opposed to a static or equal-time correlation function which would only consider `t=0`.\n\n2.  **Identify the Mathematical Operation: The Space-Time Double Fourier Transform**\n    *   The question asks for the name of the result of applying a double Fourier transform to `g(r, t)`.\n    *   **Space Transform:** A Fourier transform is applied with respect to the spatial variable `r`. The conjugate variable is the wave vector, `k`. This transform resolves the spatial correlations into a spectrum of spatial modes or waves.\n    *   **Time Transform:** A Fourier transform is applied with respect to the time variable `t`. The conjugate variable is the angular frequency, `ω`. This transform resolves the temporal correlations into a frequency spectrum.\n    *   The combined operation is:\n        $S(k, \\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} g(r, t) e^{-i(k \\cdot r - \\omega t)} d^3r dt$\n    *   This function `S(k, ω)` describes the density of fluctuation power for a given spatial mode `k` and temporal frequency `ω`.\n\n3.  **Identify the Common Name in the Nuclear Criticality Community**\n    *   This mathematical structure is not unique to nuclear physics. It is fundamental to the study of any fluctuating many-body system, such as liquids, gases, and plasmas.\n    *   In condensed matter physics, the space-time Fourier transform of the van Hove correlation function (which is another name for the generalized pair correlation function) is called the **Dynamic Structure Factor**. It is directly proportional to the double differential scattering cross-section measured in inelastic neutron scattering experiments.\n    *   The nuclear criticality and reactor noise community has adopted this exact terminology. The stochastic fluctuations in the neutron population within a reactor or subcritical assembly can be treated analytically in the same way as density fluctuations in a fluid. The `S(k, ω)` function provides deep physical insight into the system:\n        *   It describes the spectrum of \"neutron waves\" or organized fluctuations in the system.\n        *   The peaks in `S(k, ω)` reveal the dispersion relation `ω(k)` of these neutron waves.\n        *   The properties of this function are directly related to the kinetic parameters of the system, such as the neutron lifetime, the effective delayed neutron fraction, and, most importantly, the reactivity (i.e., how close the system is to criticality).\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Distinction from Power Spectral Density (PSD):** The PSD (often called the Auto-Power Spectral Density, APSD, or Cross-Power Spectral Density, CPSD) is the Fourier transform with respect to **time only**. It is a function of frequency `ω` but still depends on spatial locations, e.g., `CPSD(r₁, r₂, ω)`. The Dynamic Structure Factor is the further Fourier transform of the CPSD with respect to the spatial separation `r₂ - r₁`.\n*   **Distinction from Static Structure Factor:** The Static Structure Factor, `S(k)`, is the Fourier transform of the *equal-time* (`t=0`) pair correlation function. It describes only the spatial correlations, losing all dynamic information.\n*   **Terminology Connection:** The use of the term \"Dynamic Structure Factor\" in the nuclear community highlights the deep physical connection between the behavior of neutrons in a multiplying medium and the collective particle dynamics in other fields of statistical mechanics. Seminal textbooks on reactor noise, like \"Random Processes in Nuclear Reactors\" by M.M.R. Williams, formally define and use this term.\n\n### Final Answer Acquisition\n\nBased on the analysis, the space-time, double Fourier transform of the generalized pair correlation function is a well-established quantity in reactor physics and noise analysis. It inherits its name directly from the broader field of statistical mechanics.\n\nThe name is the **Dynamic Structure Factor**.\n\n<<<Dynamic Structure Factor>>>"
