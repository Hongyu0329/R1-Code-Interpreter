    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Definition of the Graph \\( G \\)\n\nThe problem states that \\( G \\) is the \"sum of three cycles of length \\( n \\)\". In graph theory, the \"sum\" of graphs, often denoted by \\( + \\), refers to the **graph join** operation.\n\n*   **Graph Join (\\( G_1 + G_2 \\)):** The join of two graphs \\( G_1 = (V_1, E_1) \\) and \\( G_2 = (V_2, E_2) \\) (assuming their vertex sets \\( V_1 \\) and \\( V_2 \\) are disjoint) is a new graph \\( G_1 + G_2 \\). The vertex set of this new graph is \\( V_1 \\cup V_2 \\). The edge set consists of all edges from \\( E_1 \\), all edges from \\( E_2 \\), and a new set of edges connecting every vertex in \\( V_1 \\) to every vertex in \\( V_2 \\).\n\n*   **The Graph G:** Let the three cycles of length \\( n \\) be \\( C_n^{(1)} \\), \\( C_n^{(2)} \\), and \\( C_n^{(3)} \\). The graph \\( G \\) is \\( C_n^{(1)} + C_n^{(2)} + C_n^{(3)} \\). This means we take the three disjoint cycles and add edges between every pair of vertices that belong to different cycles.\n\n### Step 2: Relate the Chromatic Number to the Graph Join Operation\n\nA crucial property of the chromatic number with respect to the graph join operation is that it is additive.\n\n*   **Property:** For any two graphs \\( H_1 \\) and \\( H_2 \\), the chromatic number of their join is \\( \\chi(H_1 + H_2) = \\chi(H_1) + \\chi(H_2) \\).\n\n*   **Reasoning:** Let's say we have a proper coloring for \\( H_1 + H_2 \\). Because every vertex of \\( H_1 \\) is adjacent to every vertex of \\( H_2 \\), the set of colors used for the vertices of \\( H_1 \\) must be completely disjoint from the set of colors used for the vertices of \\( H_2 \\). To minimize the total number of colors, we must use the minimum number of colors for \\( H_1 \\) (which is \\( \\chi(H_1) \\)) and the minimum number for \\( H_2 \\) (which is \\( \\chi(H_2) \\)). Since these color sets must be disjoint, the total number of colors is \\( \\chi(H_1) + \\chi(H_2) \\).\n\n*   **Extension to Three Graphs:** This property extends to the join of three graphs.\n    \\( \\chi(G) = \\chi(C_n^{(1)} + C_n^{(2)} + C_n^{(3)}) = \\chi(C_n^{(1)}) + \\chi(C_n^{(2)}) + \\chi(C_n^{(3)}) \\)\n\nSince all three cycles are of the same length \\( n \\), their chromatic numbers are identical.\n\\( \\chi(G) = 3 \\cdot \\chi(C_n) \\)\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Chromatic Number of a Cycle \\( C_n \\)\n\nThe chromatic number of a cycle \\( C_n \\) depends on whether \\( n \\) is even or odd. We assume \\( n \\ge 3 \\), as a cycle requires at least 3 vertices.\n\n*   **Case 1: \\( n \\) is even.** If \\( n \\) is an even number (\\( n \\ge 4 \\)), the cycle \\( C_n \\) is a bipartite graph. This means its vertices can be colored using only two colors, by alternating colors as we go around the cycle. Therefore, for even \\( n \\), \\( \\chi(C_n) = 2 \\).\n\n*   **Case 2: \\( n \\) is odd.** If \\( n \\) is an odd number (\\( n \\ge 3 \\)), the cycle \\( C_n \\) is not bipartite. If we try to color it with two colors, alternating as we go around, the \\( n \\)-th vertex will be adjacent to two vertices of different colors, but it will also be adjacent to the first vertex, which will have the same color. Thus, a third color is required for the \\( n \\)-th vertex. Therefore, for odd \\( n \\), \\( \\chi(C_n) = 3 \\).\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Possible Values for \\( \\chi(G) \\)\n\nNow we can calculate \\( \\chi(G) \\) for the two cases based on the parity of \\( n \\).\n\n*   **If \\( n \\) is even:**\n    \\( \\chi(G) = 3 \\cdot \\chi(C_n) = 3 \\cdot 2 = 6 \\)\n\n*   **If \\( n \\) is odd:**\n    \\( \\chi(G) = 3 \\cdot \\chi(C_n) = 3 \\cdot 3 = 9 \\)\n\n### Step 5: Find the Maximal Chromatic Number\n\nThe question asks for the **maximal** chromatic number of \\( G \\). This means we must consider all possible integer values for \\( n \\ge 3 \\) and find the largest possible value for \\( \\chi(G) \\).\n\nThe possible values for \\( \\chi(G) \\) are 6 (when \\( n \\) is even) and 9 (when \\( n \\) is odd). The maximum of these two values is 9. This maximum value is achieved for any choice of odd \\( n \\) (e.g., \\( n=3, 5, 7, \\dots \\)).\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe maximal chromatic number of a graph that is the sum of three cycles of length \\( n \\) is 9.\n\n<<<9>>>"
