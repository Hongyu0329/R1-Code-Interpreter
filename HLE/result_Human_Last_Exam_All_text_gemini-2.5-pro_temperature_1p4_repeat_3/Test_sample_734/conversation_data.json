    "### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The user is asking for the *first Christian theologian* who created *specialized terminology* to explain *changes in the laws of nature*. This terminology needs to be applicable to two specific and distinct events: the *virgin birth* (a specific miracle) and the *effects of the Fall* (a fundamental, ongoing alteration of the natural order).\n\n2.  **Identify Key Concepts:**\n    *   **\"First Christian theologian\":** This points to a foundational figure, likely in the Patristic (Early Church Fathers) or Medieval period. It rules out modern theologians.\n    *   **\"Specialized terminology\":** This is crucial. The answer isn't just a theologian who discussed these topics, but one who coined or adapted specific philosophical/theological terms to create a systematic explanation.\n    *   **\"Changes in the laws of nature\":** While the modern concept of \"laws of nature\" as rigid mathematical principles developed later (with figures like Descartes and Newton), the ancient and medieval world had a strong concept of the *ordo naturae* (the order of nature). A \"change\" would be an event that operates contrary to the normal, observable course of this natural order.\n    *   **Application to both Virgin Birth and the Fall:** The theological system must be robust enough to account for a positive, singular miracle (Christ's birth) and a negative, universal change in the state of creation (the consequences of sin).\n\n3.  **Evaluate Potential Candidates:**\n\n    *   **Thomas Aquinas (13th Century):** Aquinas developed a very sophisticated system for understanding miracles. He categorized them as events God could perform *supra naturam* (above nature), where God acts directly without secondary, natural causes. This framework certainly explains the virgin birth. However, it primarily explains miracles as God acting *outside* the natural order rather than changing its internal laws. While his theology deals with the consequences of the Fall, he doesn't typically use the *same specific terminology* to frame the Fall's effects as a change in natural law in the same way he categorizes miracles.\n\n    *   **Post-Reformation Scholastics (e.g., Francis Turretin, 17th Century):** These theologians refined concepts like God's \"ordinary providence\" (upholding the regularities of nature) and \"extraordinary providence\" (miracles). This is a system for explaining deviations from the norm. However, it may not be the *first*, and the terms \"ordinary/extraordinary providence\" are more of a framework than a single piece of specialized terminology that explains the *mechanism* of change in both cases.\n\n    *   **Augustine of Hippo (354–430 AD):** Augustine is a prime candidate. He was one of the first to grapple with these issues systematically in response to various heresies and philosophical questions. He faced the problem of how God could perform miracles or how new things could appear in creation after He had \"rested\" on the seventh day.\n        *   **Specialized Terminology:** To solve this, Augustine developed the doctrine of ***rationes seminales*** (or *rationes causales*), which translates to **\"seminal reasons\"** or **\"causal reasons.\"** This was a concept he adapted from Stoic philosophy.\n        *   **How it Works:** Augustine proposed that God, in the initial act of creation, embedded these \"seeds\" or latent potentialities for everything that would ever come into being. The regular, everyday functioning of the world is the natural unfolding of some of these potentialities.\n        *   **Application to the Virgin Birth:** The virgin birth was not a violation of nature as God created it, but the activation of a special \"seminal reason\" that God had placed within creation (and specifically, within the line of David and the body of Mary) from the very beginning. It was contrary to the *usual course* of nature that we observe, but not contrary to the deeper, God-ordained potential of nature.\n        *   **Application to the Fall:** Similarly, the negative consequences of the Fall—death, disease, pain in childbirth, thorns and thistles—can be understood within this system. These were not part of the world's *actualized* state before sin, but the potential for them existed. Human sin then acted as the trigger that caused the created order to begin unfolding in this corrupted, painful, and mortal way. This represents a fundamental change in the *operating principles* of the world, moving from a pre-lapsarian to a post-lapsarian state.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** Augustine of Hippo is the first major Christian theologian to develop a specific, technical vocabulary—the *rationes seminales*—to provide a metaphysical explanation for how the operations of nature could change. This system is uniquely suited to explain both singular miracles like the virgin birth and the systemic, ongoing changes to the natural world that resulted from the Fall, framing both as the actualization of potentialities embedded in creation by God from the beginning.\n\n***\n\n### Careful Points to Note:\n\n*   **Concept Evolution:** The term \"laws of nature\" is anachronistic when applied to Augustine. He would have spoken of the \"order of nature\" (*ordo naturae*). However, the core concept of a regular, God-ordained pattern and exceptions to it is the same.\n*   **\"First\":** Claiming someone is \"first\" is always difficult, but within the mainstream of Western Christian theology, Augustine's systematic development of this idea is foundational and unparalleled by earlier figures.\n*   **Specificity of Terminology:** The key is the *specialized* terminology. Many theologians talked about God's power over nature, but Augustine's *rationes seminales* is a specific technical term used to build a coherent system that addresses these exact problems.\n*   **Dual Applicability:** The strength of Augustine's solution, and why it fits the question perfectly, is its ability to account for both a one-time miracle and a lasting change in the state of nature using the same underlying principle.\n\nThe final answer is **Augustine of Hippo**.\n\n<<<Augustine of Hippo>>>"
