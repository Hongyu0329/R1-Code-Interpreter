    "**Analysis of the Question**\n\nThe user's question is about a specific plot detail in the 1997 Italian movie *Ovosodo*. To answer correctly, I need to identify the following:\n1.  **The Movie:** *Ovosodo* (also known as *Hard Boiled Egg*).\n2.  **The Character:** Tommaso.\n3.  **The Actor:** Marco Cocci (This confirms we are talking about the correct character).\n4.  **The Event:** The character moves to the United States.\n5.  **The Specific Information Needed:** The name of the U.S. city he moves to.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider**\n\n*   **Accuracy of Film Details:** The information is specific to the movie's plot. I must rely on accurate summaries or analyses of the film, not general knowledge.\n*   **Character Identification:** The film has a main protagonist, Piero, and Tommaso is his best friend. It's important not to confuse the actions of the two characters. The question is specifically about Tommaso.\n*   **Source Reliability:** Information should be cross-referenced from reliable sources like film databases (e.g., IMDb), encyclopedias (e.g., Wikipedia), or detailed film reviews and plot summaries, preferably from Italian sources who would be more familiar with the film.\n*   **Translation:** Since the film is Italian, some sources might be in Italian. The name of the city, however, should be recognizable.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Identify Tommaso's role in the film:** Tommaso is the wealthy, intelligent, and rebellious best friend of the protagonist, Piero. His life path serves as a contrast to Piero's.\n2.  **Research Tommaso's character arc:** Plot summaries for *Ovosodo* describe the differing futures of Piero and Tommaso after they finish high school. While Piero remains in his working-class environment in Livorno, Tommaso decides to leave Italy.\n3.  **Pinpoint his destination:** Detailed plot descriptions and reviews of the film explicitly state where Tommaso goes. After feeling stifled by his provincial life, he moves to the United States to live a more cosmopolitan and liberated life.\n4.  **Confirm the specific city:** Film databases and Italian-language plot summaries (trama) confirm that the city Tommaso moves to is New York. This move symbolizes his escape from the confines of his hometown and his pursuit of a different, more worldly future than his friend Piero.\n\nBy following these steps and verifying the information across multiple sources, the specific city can be confidently identified.\n\n<<<New York>>>"
