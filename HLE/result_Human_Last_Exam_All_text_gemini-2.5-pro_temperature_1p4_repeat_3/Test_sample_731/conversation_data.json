    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of power subgroups in the semidihedral group of size 512.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the definitions**\n\n*   **Semidihedral Group:** The semidihedral group of order $2^n$ (for $n \\ge 3$) is denoted $SD_{2^n}$. The size of our group is 512, which is $2^9$. So we are dealing with the group $G = SD_{512}$, where $n=9$.\n    The group has the presentation:\n    $G = \\langle r, s \\mid r^{2^{n-1}} = s^2 = 1, srs = r^{-1+2^{n-2}} \\rangle$\n    For $n=9$, this becomes:\n    $G = \\langle r, s \\mid r^{2^8} = s^2 = 1, srs = r^{-1+2^7} \\rangle$\n    $G = \\langle r, s \\mid r^{256} = 1, s^2 = 1, srs = r^{127} \\rangle$\n    The elements of $G$ are of the form $r^i$ or $sr^i$ for $0 \\le i < 256$. The group has a cyclic subgroup $\\langle r \\rangle$ of order 256, which is of index 2 in $G$.\n\n*   **Power Subgroup:** A subgroup $H$ of a group $G$ is called a power subgroup if there exists an integer $k$ such that $H$ is the set of all $k$-th powers of elements of $G$. This set is denoted by $G^k = \\{g^k \\mid g \\in G\\}$. We need to find the number of distinct subgroups that can be formed this way.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the structure of $G^k$**\n\nThe calculation of $g^k$ depends on the form of the element $g$ and the parity of the exponent $k$.\n\n*   **Elements of the form $g=r^i$:** For any $k$, $g^k = (r^i)^k = r^{ik}$. The set of all such powers for a fixed $k$ forms a cyclic subgroup $\\langle r^{\\gcd(k, 256)} \\rangle$.\n\n*   **Elements of the form $g=sr^i$:** The structure of $(sr^i)^k$ depends on whether $k$ is even or odd.\n    Let's first compute $(sr^i)^2$:\n    $(sr^i)^2 = (sr^i)(sr^i) = s(r^i s)r^i$.\n    From the relation $srs = r^{127}$, and since $s=s^{-1}$, we have $srs^{-1} = r^{127}$.\n    This implies $sr^i s^{-1} = (srs^{-1})^i = (r^{127})^i = r^{127i}$.\n    So, $s(r^i s) = r^{127i}$.\n    Therefore, $(sr^i)^2 = r^{127i} r^i = r^{128i} = r^{i \\cdot 2^7}$.\n\nNow we can analyze $G^k$ based on the parity of $k$.\n\n**Case 1: $k$ is odd**\n\nIf $k$ is an odd integer, the mapping $\\phi_k: G \\to G$ defined by $\\phi_k(g) = g^k$ is a bijection.\nTo show this for a finite group, we only need to show it's surjective.\n*   For any target element $r^j \\in \\langle r \\rangle$, we need to find $g \\in G$ such that $g^k = r^j$. Let's try $g=r^i$. We need to solve $(r^i)^k = r^{ik} = r^j$, which is $ik \\equiv j \\pmod{256}$. Since $k$ is odd, $\\gcd(k, 256) = 1$, so this congruence always has a unique solution for $i$.\n*   For any target element $sr^j \\notin \\langle r \\rangle$, we need to find $g \\in G$ such that $g^k = sr^j$. Let's try $g=sr^i$. As $k$ is odd, let $k=2m+1$.\n    $(sr^i)^k = (sr^i)^{2m+1} = ((sr^i)^2)^m (sr^i) = (r^{128i})^m (sr^i) = r^{128im}sr^i$.\n    We need to show that for any $j$, there is an $i$ such that $r^{128im}sr^i = sr^j$.\n    Using the relation $sr^a = r^{127a}s$, we can write $r^{128im}s = s r^{127 \\cdot 128im}$.\n    So $r^{128im}sr^i = s r^{127 \\cdot 128im} r^i = s r^{i(1 + 127 \\cdot 128m)}$.\n    $127 \\cdot 128 \\equiv (-1) \\cdot 128 = -128 \\equiv 128 \\pmod{256}$.\n    So we need to solve $j \\equiv i(1 + 128m) \\pmod{256}$.\n    The coefficient of $i$ is $1+128m$, which is odd. Thus, $\\gcd(1+128m, 256) = 1$. The congruence always has a unique solution for $i$.\n\nSince every element in $G$ is a $k$-th power for any odd $k$, the set of $k$-th powers is the entire group $G$.\nSo, for any odd integer $k$, $G^k = G$. This gives us one distinct power subgroup.\n\n**Careful Point:** This result can be more elegantly confirmed using the Frattini subgroup. For a p-group like $G=SD_{512}$, the Frattini subgroup $\\Phi(G)$ is $G'G^2$. Here $G' = [G,G]=\\langle r^2 \\rangle$ and (as we will see next) $G^2 = \\langle r^2 \\rangle$. Thus $\\Phi(G)=\\langle r^2 \\rangle$. The quotient group $G/\\Phi(G)$ has exponent 2. By a theorem of Burnside, if $\\gcd(k, \\text{exp}(G/\\Phi(G)))=1$, the map $g \\mapsto g^k$ is a permutation of $G$. For $k$ odd, $\\gcd(k,2)=1$, so the condition holds.\n\n**Case 2: $k$ is even**\n\nLet $k$ be an even integer. Let $k = 2^a \\cdot b$, where $b$ is odd and $a \\ge 1$.\n*   Powers of elements in $\\langle r \\rangle$: $\\{ (r^i)^k \\mid i \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\} = \\langle r^{\\gcd(k, 256)} \\rangle = \\langle r^{2^{\\min(a, 8)}} \\rangle$.\n*   Powers of elements not in $\\langle r \\rangle$: $\\{ (sr^i)^k \\mid i \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\}$. Since $k$ is even, let $k=2m$.\n    $(sr^i)^k = ((sr^i)^2)^m = (r^{128i})^m = r^{128im} = r^{i \\cdot (k/2) \\cdot 128} = r^{64ik}$.\n    The set of these powers is $\\langle r^{\\gcd(64k, 256)} \\rangle$.\n    The term $64k = 2^6 \\cdot 2^a b = 2^{a+6} b$.\n    So $\\gcd(64k, 256) = \\gcd(2^{a+6}b, 2^8) = 2^{\\min(a+6, 8)}$.\n\nThe power subgroup $G^k$ is the union of these two sets, which is $\\langle r^{2^{\\min(a, 8)}} \\rangle \\cup \\langle r^{2^{\\min(a+6, 8)}} \\rangle$.\nFor the union of two subgroups to be a subgroup, one must be contained within the other.\nSince $a \\ge 1$, we have $a+6 > a$. It can be shown that $\\min(a+6, 8) \\ge \\min(a, 8)$ for all $a \\ge 1$.\nThis means that $r^{2^{\\min(a+6, 8)}}$ is a power of $r^{2^{\\min(a, 8)}}$, so $\\langle r^{2^{\\min(a+6, 8)}} \\rangle \\subseteq \\langle r^{2^{\\min(a, 8)}} \\rangle$.\nTherefore, for any even $k=2^a b$, the power subgroup is $G^k = \\langle r^{2^{\\min(a, 8)}} \\rangle$.\n\n**Step 3: Count the distinct power subgroups**\n\nWe need to find how many different subgroups we can obtain by varying $k$.\n\n1.  **From odd $k$**: We get only one subgroup: $G$.\n2.  **From even $k$**: The subgroup is determined by $a = \\nu_2(k)$, the exponent of the highest power of 2 that divides $k$. Since $k$ is even, $a \\ge 1$.\n    *   If $a=1$ (e.g., $k=2, 6, 10, \\dots$), the subgroup is $\\langle r^{2^{\\min(1, 8)}} \\rangle = \\langle r^2 \\rangle$.\n    *   If $a=2$ (e.g., $k=4, 12, 20, \\dots$), the subgroup is $\\langle r^{2^{\\min(2, 8)}} \\rangle = \\langle r^4 \\rangle$.\n    *   If $a=3$, the subgroup is $\\langle r^{2^3} \\rangle = \\langle r^8 \\rangle$.\n    *   If $a=4$, the subgroup is $\\langle r^{16} \\rangle$.\n    *   If $a=5$, the subgroup is $\\langle r^{32} \\rangle$.\n    *   If $a=6$, the subgroup is $\\langle r^{64} \\rangle$.\n    *   If $a=7$, the subgroup is $\\langle r^{128} \\rangle$.\n    *   If $a \\ge 8$ (e.g., $k=256, 512, \\dots$), the subgroup is $\\langle r^{2^{\\min(a, 8)}} \\rangle = \\langle r^{2^8} \\rangle = \\langle r^{256} \\rangle = \\{1\\}$.\n\nThis gives 8 distinct subgroups for even values of $k$. These are the 8 proper non-trivial subgroups in the chain of subgroups of $\\langle r \\rangle$, plus the trivial subgroup:\n$\\langle r^2 \\rangle, \\langle r^4 \\rangle, \\langle r^8 \\rangle, \\langle r^{16} \\rangle, \\langle r^{32} \\rangle, \\langle r^{64} \\rangle, \\langle r^{128} \\rangle, \\{1\\}$.\n\n**Step 4: Final Count**\n\nThe set of all power subgroups of $G=SD_{512}$ is:\n$\\{ G \\} \\cup \\{ \\langle r^2 \\rangle, \\langle r^4 \\rangle, \\langle r^8 \\rangle, \\langle r^{16} \\rangle, \\langle r^{32} \\rangle, \\langle r^{64} \\rangle, \\langle r^{128} \\rangle, \\{1\\} \\}$.\n\nThese are all distinct. $G$ is non-cyclic and has order 512. The other 8 subgroups are cyclic and have orders $128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1$, respectively. Since their orders are all different, they are all distinct from each other and from $G$.\n\nTotal number of power subgroups = 1 (from odd k) + 8 (from even k) = 9.\n\nIn general, for the semidihedral group $SD_{2^n}$, there are $n$ power subgroups. For $SD_{512}$, $n=9$, so there are 9 power subgroups.\n\n<<<9>>>"
