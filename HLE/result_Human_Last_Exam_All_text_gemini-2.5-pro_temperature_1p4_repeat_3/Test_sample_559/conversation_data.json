    "**1. System and Equilibrium Points**\n\nThe system of differential equations is given by:\n1.  $d'(t) = 2d^2(t) + (-3u(t) + 5u^2(t))d(t) - u^3(t)(1 - u(t))$\n2.  $u'(t) = (u(t) - 1)u^2(t)$\n\nWe need to find the equilibrium points where $d'(t) = 0$ and $u'(t) = 0$.\n\nFrom $u'(t) = 0$, we have $(u-1)u^2 = 0$, which yields $u=0$ or $u=1$.\n\n*   **Case 1: u = 0**\n    Substituting $u=0$ into the equation for $d'$ gives:\n    $d' = 2d^2 + (-3(0) + 5(0)^2)d - 0^3(1-0) = 2d^2$.\n    Setting $d' = 0$, we get $2d^2 = 0$, so $d=0$.\n    This gives the equilibrium point **(0, 0)**.\n\n*   **Case 2: u = 1**\n    Substituting $u=1$ into the equation for $d'$ gives:\n    $d' = 2d^2 + (-3(1) + 5(1)^2)d - 1^3(1-1) = 2d^2 + 2d$.\n    Setting $d' = 0$, we get $2d^2 + 2d = 0$, which factors as $2d(d+1) = 0$.\n    This gives $d=0$ or $d=-1$.\n    This gives the equilibrium points **(1, 0)** and **(1, -1)**.\n\nSo, the system has three equilibrium points: (0, 0), (1, 0), and (1, -1).\n\n**2. Stability Analysis of Equilibrium Points**\n\nTo classify the equilibrium points, we compute the Jacobian matrix of the system:\n$J(u, d) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial u} & \\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial d} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial d'}{\\partial u} & \\frac{\\partial d'}{\\partial d} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 3u^2 - 2u & 0 \\\\ (10u - 3)d - 3u^2 + 4u^3 & 4d + 5u^2 - 3u \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n*   **Point (1, -1):**\n    $J(1, -1) = \\begin{pmatrix} 3(1)^2 - 2(1) & 0 \\\\ (10(1) - 3)(-1) - 3(1)^2 + 4(1)^3 & 4(-1) + 5(1)^2 - 3(1) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ -6 & -2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    The eigenvalues are the diagonal entries, $\\lambda_1 = 1$ and $\\lambda_2 = -2$. Since the eigenvalues are real and have opposite signs, the point **(1, -1) is a saddle point**.\n\n*   **Point (1, 0):**\n    $J(1, 0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 3(1)^2 - 2(1) & 0 \\\\ (10(1) - 3)(0) - 3(1)^2 + 4(1)^3 & 4(0) + 5(1)^2 - 3(1) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1 = 1$ and $\\lambda_2 = 2$. Since both are positive, the point **(1, 0) is an unstable node**.\n\n*   **Point (0, 0):**\n    $J(0, 0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$. The linearization is inconclusive, so this is a non-hyperbolic point.\n\n**3. Finding the Separatrix**\n\nA separatrix is a curve in the phase plane that separates regions of different qualitative behavior. The stable and unstable manifolds of a saddle point are always separatrices. We have a saddle point at (1, -1).\n\nLet's look for an invariant curve of the form $d = f(u)$. An invariant curve is a trajectory of the system. If we assume $d(t) = f(u(t))$, then by the chain rule, $d'(t) = f'(u)u'(t)$. Substituting the expressions for $d'$ and $u'$ gives the phase plane equation:\n$f'(u) u' = 2(f(u))^2 + (-3u + 5u^2)f(u) - u^3(1 - u)$\n$f'(u) (u-1)u^2 = 2(f(u))^2 + (5u^2-3u)f(u) + u^4-u^3$\n\nLet's test if a simple polynomial curve could be a solution. We can try $d = -u^2$.\nLet's check if this is an invariant curve.\nIf $d(t) = -u(t)^2$, then the left side of the $d'$ equation is:\n$d'(t) = \\frac{d}{dt}(-u^2) = -2u \\cdot u'(t) = -2u \\cdot (u-1)u^2 = -2u^4 + 2u^3$.\n\nNow let's compute the right side of the $d'$ equation by substituting $d = -u^2$:\nRHS $= 2(-u^2)^2 + (-3u + 5u^2)(-u^2) - u^3(1 - u)$\nRHS $= 2u^4 + (3u^3 - 5u^4) - (u^3 - u^4)$\nRHS $= 2u^4 + 3u^3 - 5u^4 - u^3 + u^4$\nRHS $= (2 - 5 + 1)u^4 + (3 - 1)u^3 = -2u^4 + 2u^3$.\n\nSince the left and right sides are equal, the curve $d = -u^2$ is indeed an invariant manifold (a trajectory).\n\nLet's see where this trajectory goes.\n*   If $u=1$, then $d = -(1)^2 = -1$. The curve passes through the saddle point (1, -1).\n*   If $u=0$, then $d = -(0)^2 = 0$. The curve passes through the equilibrium point (0, 0).\n\nA trajectory that connects two equilibrium points is called a heteroclinic orbit. An invariant curve passing through a saddle point must be part of its stable or unstable manifold. To determine which, we analyze the direction of flow on the curve, which is determined by $u'(t) = u^2(u-1)$.\n*   For $0 < u < 1$, $u' < 0$, so the trajectory moves from $u=1$ towards $u=0$.\n*   For $u > 1$, $u' > 0$, so the trajectory moves away from $u=1$.\nIn both cases, the flow along the curve $d=-u^2$ is away from the saddle point (1, -1). Therefore, the curve $d=-u^2$ is the unstable manifold of the saddle point (1, -1).\n\nThe unstable manifold of a saddle point is a separatrix, as it divides the phase plane into regions with distinct long-term behaviors. Trajectories starting on one side of this curve will behave differently from trajectories starting on the other side.\n\nThus, the separatrix of the system is the parabola defined by the equation $d = -u^2$.\n\n<<<d = -u^2>>>"
