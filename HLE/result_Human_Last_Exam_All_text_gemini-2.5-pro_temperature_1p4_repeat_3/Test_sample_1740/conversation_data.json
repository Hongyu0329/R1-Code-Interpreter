    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of let-7 family members in humans.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Question**\nThe question asks for the total number of members of the \"let-7 family\" of microRNAs that have been identified in humans to date. The term \"member\" can be slightly ambiguous, so it's important to clarify what it typically refers to in this context.\n\n**Step 2: Define the let-7 Family and \"Members\"**\nThe let-7 family is a group of microRNAs (miRNAs) that are highly conserved across animal species and share a similar \"seed sequence,\" which determines their target genes. When scientists refer to the \"members\" of this family, they are typically referring to the unique mature miRNA sequences, distinguished by a letter (e.g., let-7a, let-7b). This is distinct from the number of genes that encode them, as some members are encoded by more than one gene.\n\n**Step 3: Consult a Definitive Database**\nThe primary and most authoritative repository for miRNA data is miRBase. We will use the information cataloged in miRBase for *Homo sapiens* (human) to identify the members.\n\n**Step 4: Identify and List the Members**\nBy querying miRBase for the let-7 family in humans, we can compile a list of the distinct members. The let-7 family is designated as MIPF0000002 in the miRBase family registry. For humans (*hsa*), the following members are listed:\n\n1.  **let-7a**\n2.  **let-7b**\n3.  **let-7c**\n4.  **let-7d**\n5.  **let-7e**\n6.  **let-7f**\n7.  **let-7g**\n8.  **let-7i** (Note: there is no \"let-7h\" in humans)\n9.  **miR-98** (This miRNA is structurally and functionally part of the let-7 family despite its different name).\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Members vs. Genes:** It's crucial not to confuse the number of family members with the number of genes. Some members are encoded by multiple genes (paralogs). For example:\n    *   **let-7a** is encoded by three different genes (hsa-let-7a-1, hsa-let-7a-2, hsa-let-7a-3).\n    *   **let-7f** is encoded by two different genes (hsa-let-7f-1, hsa-let-7f-2).\n    *   The other 7 members are each encoded by a single gene.\n    *   This means the 9 distinct mature members are produced from a total of **12 different genes**. The question asks for \"members,\" which is best interpreted as the 9 distinct types.\n\n2.  **Mature miRNA Variants (-5p/-3p):** Each miRNA precursor (pre-miRNA) hairpin is typically processed into two mature miRNAs, one from the 5' arm (named -5p) and one from the 3' arm (named -3p). For example, the hsa-let-7a-1 precursor produces both hsa-let-7a-5p and hsa-let-7a-3p. However, when counting \"family members,\" the letter designation (e.g., let-7a) is counted as one member, representing the primary functional miRNA and its related variants.\n\n3.  **Nomenclature:** The member miR-98 belongs to the let-7 family due to its shared seed sequence and function, even though its name does not start with \"let-7.\" It is a consensus member of the family.\n\n### Final Answer Acquisition\n\nBased on the standard scientific classification found in miRBase and widely accepted in the research community, we count the number of distinct mature miRNA types within the family.\n\n*   List the identified members: let-7a, let-7b, let-7c, let-7d, let-7e, let-7f, let-7g, let-7i, and miR-98.\n*   Count the items on the list.\n*   The total count is 9.\n\nTo date, 9 members of the let-7 family have been identified in humans.\n\n<<<9>>>"
