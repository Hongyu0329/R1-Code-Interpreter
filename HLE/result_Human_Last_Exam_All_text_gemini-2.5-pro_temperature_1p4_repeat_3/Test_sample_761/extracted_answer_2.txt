No, polynucleotides are not structurally polysaccharides. They belong to two distinct classes of biological macromolecules due to fundamental differences in their monomer units, backbone composition, and the chemical bonds linking them. A polysaccharide is a polymer of monosaccharides linked by glycosidic bonds, while a polynucleotide is a polymer of nucleotides (composed of a sugar, a phosphate, and a nitrogenous base) linked by phosphodiester bonds.
