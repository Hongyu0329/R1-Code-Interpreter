    "An analysis of the problem of finding the smallest number of edges $e$ in a simple, connected graph $\\gamma$ with an automorphism group of size 3.\n\n**1. Properties of the Automorphism Group**\n\nThe automorphism group $\\mathrm{Aut}(\\gamma)$ must have order 3. The only group of order 3 is the cyclic group $\\mathbb{Z}_3$. Let the group be $G = \\{id, \\phi, \\phi^2\\}$, where $\\phi$ is an automorphism of order 3.\n\n**2. Action of the Group on Vertices and Edges**\n\nThe group $\\mathrm{Aut}(\\gamma)$ acts on the set of vertices $V$ and the set of edges $E$.\n- The size of any orbit of this action must divide the order of the group, which is 3. So, vertex orbits can have size 1 (fixed points) or 3. Edge orbits can also have size 1 or 3.\n- An edge can only be in an orbit of size 1 (a fixed edge) if it connects two fixed vertices. If a graph has two fixed vertices $u,v$, and an edge $\\{u,v\\}$, an automorphism swapping $u$ and $v$ could exist. To prevent this, the fixed vertices must be structurally different. A graph consisting of just two vertices and one edge has $|\\mathrm{Aut}|=2$. If there are more vertices, a simple edge between two fixed points is unlikely to be the sole structure.\n- If an edge is not fixed, it must be in an orbit of size 3. This means that the total number of edges $e$ must be a multiple of 3 if there are no fixed edges. If there are fixed edges, the number of non-fixed edges must be a multiple of 3.\n\n**3. Searching for the Graph**\n\nLet's try to construct a minimal graph by increasing the number of edges $e$, which must be a multiple of 3.\n\n*   **Case $e=3$**:\n    - A cycle $C_3$ has $|\\mathrm{Aut}(C_3)|=6$ (the dihedral group $D_3$).\n    - A path $P_4$ has $|\\mathrm{Aut}(P_4)|=2$.\n    - A star graph $K_{1,3}$ has $|\\mathrm{Aut}(K_{1,3})|=6$ (the symmetric group $S_3$).\n    No graph with 3 edges works.\n\n*   **Case $e=6$**:\n    - A cycle $C_6$ has $|\\mathrm{Aut}(C_6)|=12$.\n    - We can try to build a graph. If the graph has no fixed points, its vertices must form orbits of size 3. The minimum number of vertices would be 6, in two orbits $V_1 = \\{x_1,x_2,x_3\\}$ and $V_2=\\{y_1,y_2,y_3\\}$.\n    - Consider the graph formed by a $C_3$ on $V_1$ (3 edges) and \"hanging\" edges $\\{x_i, y_i\\}$ (3 edges). So $e=6$. We have shown in the scratchpad that this graph has $|\\mathrm{Aut}|=6$, as it has a reflectional symmetry.\n    - If there is a fixed point $v_0$, the vertices could be $\\{v_0\\} \\cup V_1 \\cup V_2$. Consider edges $\\{v_0,x_i\\}$ for $i=1,2,3$ (3 edges) and $\\{x_i,y_i\\}$ for $i=1,2,3$ (3 edges). The total number of edges is $e=6$. This graph also has a reflectional symmetry, giving $|\\mathrm{Aut}|=6$. Other configurations for $e=6$ also fail to produce a group of order 3.\n\n*   **Case $e=9$**:\n    - Many constructions with 9 edges were attempted. For instance, consider a graph with 3 orbits of 3 vertices each: $V_1, V_2, V_3$. We can build a graph with 9 edges by taking a $C_3$ on $V_1$, connecting $V_1$ to $V_2$ with parallel edges, and $V_2$ to $V_3$ with twisted edges. This graph has $n=9, e=9$. As shown in the thought process, this graph possesses a reflectional symmetry, leading to $|\\mathrm{Aut}|=6$. All attempts to construct a graph with $e=9$ have failed, suggesting that no such graph exists. This is often due to the limited number of components and connections, which makes it difficult to break all reflectional symmetries without also destroying the desired 3-fold rotational symmetry.\n\n*   **Case $e=12$**:\n    - Let's try a construction with 12 edges. We need to successfully break all symmetries apart from the $\\mathbb{Z}_3$ rotation.\n    - Let's use three vertex orbits of size 3: $V_1 = \\{x_1, x_2, x_3\\}$, $V_2 = \\{y_1, y_2, y_3\\}$, and $V_3 = \\{z_1, z_2, z_3\\}$. Total vertices $n=9$.\n    - The rotational automorphism is $\\phi = (x_1 x_2 x_3)(y_1 y_2 y_3)(z_1 z_2 z_3)$.\n    - We define the graph by four orbits of edges, so $e=4 \\times 3=12$.\n        1.  A cycle on $V_1$: edges $\\{x_j, x_{j+1}\\}$ (indices mod 3).\n        2.  Parallel edges from $V_1$ to $V_2$: edges $\\{x_j, y_j\\}$.\n        3.  Parallel edges from $V_1$ to $V_3$: edges $\\{x_j, z_j\\}$.\n        4.  Twisted edges from $V_2$ to $V_3$: edges $\\{y_j, z_{j+1}\\}$ (indices mod 3).\n    - This graph is simple and connected.\n    - Let's analyze its automorphism group.\n    - **Vertex Degrees**:\n        - $\\deg(x_j) = 2 (\\text{in } V_1) + 1 (\\text{to } V_2) + 1 (\\text{to } V_3) = 4$.\n        - $\\deg(y_j) = 1 (\\text{from } V_1) + 1 (\\text{to } V_3) = 2$.\n        - $\\deg(z_j) = 1 (\\text{from } V_1) + 1 (\\text{from } V_2) = 2$.\n    - The set $V_1$ is distinguished by degree. So any automorphism must map $V_1$ to $V_1$.\n    - The sets $V_2$ and $V_3$ have the same degree sequence, so they might be interchangeable. However, neighbors of any $y_j \\in V_2$ are $\\{x_j, z_{j+1}\\}$, which have degrees $(4,2)$. Neighbors of any $z_j \\in V_3$ are $\\{x_j, y_{j-1}\\}$, which have degrees $(4,2)$. So neighborhoods don't distinguish them yet. Let's check for a symmetry $\\psi$ that swaps $V_2$ and $V_3$ while preserving $V_1$. For instance, let's test $\\psi(x_j)=x_j, \\psi(y_j)=z_j, \\psi(z_j)=y_j$. This preserves edge sets 2 and 3. Let's check edge set 4: $\\psi(\\{y_j, z_{j+1}\\}) = \\{z_j, y_{j+1}\\}$. For this to be an edge set, $\\{z_j, y_{j+1}\\}$ must be in the graph's edge set for all $j$. The edges are of the form $\\{y_k, z_{k+1}\\}$. So, $\\{y_{j+1}, z_j\\}$ must be an edge. This would mean $j = (j+1)+1 \\pmod 3$, or $j = j+2 \\pmod 3$, which is false. Thus, no such symmetry exists.\n    - So, any automorphism must preserve all three orbits $V_1, V_2, V_3$.\n    - Any automorphism $\\psi$ restricted to $V_1$ must be an automorphism of a $C_3$, i.e., $\\psi|_{V_1} \\in D_3$.\n    - **Case A: $\\psi|_{V_1}$ is a reflection.** Let's test the reflection that fixes $x_1$ and swaps $x_2, x_3$. From edge set 2, this forces a permutation on $V_2$: $y_1$ is fixed, $y_2,y_3$ are swapped. From edge set 3, this forces a permutation on $V_3$: $z_1$ is fixed, $z_2,z_3$ are swapped. So the candidate is $\\psi = (x_2 x_3)(y_2 y_3)(z_2 z_3)$. Let's check if it preserves edge set 4, $\\{y_j, z_{j+1}\\}$. Consider the edge $\\{y_1, z_2\\}$. Its image under $\\psi$ is $\\{\\psi(y_1), \\psi(z_2)\\} = \\{y_1, z_3\\}$. However, $\\{y_1, z_3\\}$ is not an edge in the graph. Therefore, $\\psi$ is not an automorphism. By conjugacy, no reflection on $V_1$ can be extended to an automorphism of the whole graph.\n    - **Case B: $\\psi|_{V_1}$ is a rotation.** If $\\psi|_{V_1}$ is a rotation (e.g., $x_1 \\to x_2 \\to x_3 \\to x_1$), then this forces corresponding rotations on $V_2$ and $V_3$. This yields the automorphism $\\phi$ that generates the group.\n    - The identity is also an automorphism.\n    - Therefore, the only automorphisms are the identity, $\\phi$, and $\\phi^2$. The automorphism group is $\\mathbb{Z}_3$, and its size is 3.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWe have demonstrated a simple, connected graph with 12 edges whose automorphism group has order 3. We have also argued that it is unlikely for such a graph to exist with 3, 6, or 9 edges. Thus, the smallest number of edges required is 12."
