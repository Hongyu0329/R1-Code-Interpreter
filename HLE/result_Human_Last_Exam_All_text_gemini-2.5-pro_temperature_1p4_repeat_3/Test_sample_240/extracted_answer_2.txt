The most common reason a functional MRI coil shows no resonance on a benchtop VNA test is due to its **active detuning circuit**. For safety during the MRI system's powerful transmit phase, receive coils are designed to be actively "detuned" (made non-resonant) by a circuit, typically using PIN diodes. This circuit is controlled by a DC voltage from the scanner. As a fail-safe measure, many coils are designed to default to this detuned, non-resonant state when they are disconnected from the scanner and unpowered. Therefore, the coil is behaving exactly as it should, and to see the resonance, you would need to apply the correct external DC bias voltage to switch it into its resonant "receive" mode. Other, less common reasons include severe geometric misalignment causing zero magnetic coupling (orthogonality) or testing a balanced coil with an unbalanced probe it is designed to reject.
