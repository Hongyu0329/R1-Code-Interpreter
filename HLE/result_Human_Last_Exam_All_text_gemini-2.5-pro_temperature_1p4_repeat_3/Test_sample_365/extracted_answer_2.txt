The product is a tricyclic ketone formed via an anionic oxy-Cope rearrangement. The reaction opens the bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene ring by cleaving the C1-C2 bond, forms a new C-C bond between C5 of the norbornene system and C2' of the cyclopentenyl ring, and converts the alcohol at C2 into a ketone. The 7,7-dimethoxy and OTBS groups remain intact. The resulting structure contains a nine-membered ring fused to a five-membered ring.
