The best replacement for the Serine-Glutamate-Glutamate-Aspartate (S-E-E-D) sequence at positions 47-50 would be to mutate all four residues to Alanine (A). The resulting sequence would be Alanine-Alanine-Alanine-Alanine (A-A-A-A). This change would eliminate the negative charges from E and D and, crucially, replace the phosphorylatable Serine with a non-phosphorylatable Alanine, thereby completely neutralizing the negatively charged environment of the patch with minimal structural disruption.
