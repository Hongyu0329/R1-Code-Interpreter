    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the correct film.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the core elements of the question.**\nThe query asks for a specific scene in a film with the following key components:\n1.  **Film Type:** A Hollywood feature film.\n2.  **Production:** Produced by a major film studio.\n3.  **Character:** A teenager.\n4.  **Prop:** A pink bike.\n5.  **Action:** The teenager pedals the bike directly toward an oncoming car.\n\n**Step 2: Identify potential film genres and eras.**\nThe combination of a teenager, a bicycle, and a confrontational scene with a car strongly points towards the \"coming-of-age\" teen drama or comedy genre. This genre was particularly prominent in the 1980s, with director John Hughes being a key figure. The major studios involved in these films were often Paramount Pictures, Universal Pictures, etc.\n\n**Step 3: Brainstorm and evaluate candidate films.**\n*   ***E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial* (1982):** Features teenagers on bikes, but the iconic scene involves flying past the moon, not confronting a car. The bikes are not pink.\n*   ***The Goonies* (1985):** Features bikes, but no specific scene matches the description.\n*   ***Sixteen Candles* (1984):** A John Hughes film, but the central conflict does not involve a bike-versus-car standoff.\n*   ***Pretty in Pink* (1986):** This title immediately stands out due to the color \"pink\". It's a major Hollywood film (Paramount Pictures) written by John Hughes and focusing on teenagers.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze *Pretty in Pink* against the question's criteria.**\n*   **Film & Studio:** *Pretty in Pink* is a 1986 Hollywood feature film produced by Paramount Pictures, a major studio. This fits.\n*   **Character:** The film's central characters, Andie, Duckie, and Blane, are all teenagers.\n*   **The Bike and the Rider:** The character most associated with a bicycle is Andie's best friend, Philip F. Dale, nicknamed \"Duckie\" (played by Jon Cryer). He is a teenager and uses his customized Schwinn bicycle as his primary mode of transport. While the bike is not solid pink, it's a flamboyant, customized machine that fits the film's overall aesthetic and title, leading many to remember it as a \"pink bike\".\n*   **The Action Scene:** There is a pivotal scene in the film where Duckie is confronted in the school parking lot by the wealthy antagonist, Steff McKee (played by James Spader). Steff, driving his car, aggressively moves toward Duckie. In an act of defiance, Duckie stands his ground on his bike and does not move, effectively facing down the oncoming car. This scene perfectly matches the description of a teenager on a bike confronting an oncoming car.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude based on the analysis.**\nAll elements from the question align with the character Duckie and a key scene in the movie *Pretty in Pink*. The film is from a major studio, Duckie is a teenager, his bike is memorable and associated with the \"pink\" theme, and he directly confronts an oncoming car while on it.\n\n<<<Pretty in Pink>>>"
