    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the solution.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Goal\nThe question asks for the 4-point Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) of an 8-point sequence. The 8-point sequence, let's call it `g(m)`, is formed by interleaving two 4-point sequences, `x(n)` and `h(n)`.\nThe sequence is: `g(m) = {x(0), h(0), x(1), h(1), x(2), h(2), x(3), h(3)}`.\n\nA key point to consider is how to compute an M-point DFT for a sequence of length N, where M < N. This operation involves time-domain aliasing (also known as folding). We must first create a 4-point sequence by aliasing the 8-point sequence `g(m)`, and then compute the 4-point DFT of the resulting sequence.\n\n### Step 2: Perform Time-Domain Aliasing\nLet the new 4-point aliased sequence be `g_a(n)`. It is defined as:\n`g_a(n) = g(n) + g(n+4)` for `n = 0, 1, 2, 3`.\n\nLet's find the elements of `g_a(n)`:\n*   `g_a(0) = g(0) + g(4) = x(0) + x(2)`\n*   `g_a(1) = g(1) + g(5) = h(0) + h(2)`\n*   `g_a(2) = g(2) + g(6) = x(1) + x(3)`\n*   `g_a(3) = g(3) + g(7) = h(1) + h(3)`\n\n### Step 3: Relate Aliased Sequence Terms to the Given DFTs\nWe need to find the values of `x(0)+x(2)`, `x(1)+x(3)`, `h(0)+h(2)`, and `h(1)+h(3)`. We can do this using the properties of the 4-point DFT.\n\nFor any 4-point sequence `z(n)` with DFT `Z(k)`, the following relations hold:\n*   `Z(0) = z(0) + z(1) + z(2) + z(3)`\n*   `Z(2) = z(0) - z(1) + z(2) - z(3)`\n\nAdding these two equations:\n`Z(0) + Z(2) = 2z(0) + 2z(2) = 2 * (z(0) + z(2))`\nTherefore, `z(0) + z(2) = (Z(0) + Z(2)) / 2`.\n\nSubtracting the second equation from the first:\n`Z(0) - Z(2) = 2z(1) + 2z(3) = 2 * (z(1) + z(3))`\nTherefore, `z(1) + z(3) = (Z(0) - Z(2)) / 2`.\n\nApplying these properties to our sequences `x(n)` and `h(n)`:\n*   `x(0) + x(2) = (X(0) + X(2)) / 2`\n*   `x(1) + x(3) = (X(0) - X(2)) / 2`\n*   `h(0) + h(2) = (H(0) + H(2)) / 2`\n*   `h(1) + h(3) = (H(0) - H(2)) / 2`\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Aliased Sequence `g_a(n)`\nWe are given:\n*   `X(k) = [1, j, -1, -j]`, so `X(0)=1` and `X(2)=-1`.\n*   `H(k) = [0, 1+j, 1, 1-j]`, so `H(0)=0` and `H(2)=1`.\n\nNow we can compute the values of `g_a(n)`:\n*   `g_a(0) = (X(0) + X(2)) / 2 = (1 + (-1)) / 2 = 0`\n*   `g_a(1) = (H(0) + H(2)) / 2 = (0 + 1) / 2 = 0.5`\n*   `g_a(2) = (X(0) - X(2)) / 2 = (1 - (-1)) / 2 = 2 / 2 = 1`\n*   `g_a(3) = (H(0) - H(2)) / 2 = (0 - 1) / 2 = -0.5`\n\nSo, the 4-point aliased sequence is `g_a(n) = {0, 0.5, 1, -0.5}`.\n\n### Step 5: Compute the 4-Point DFT of `g_a(n)`\nLet the final answer be `G(k) = DFT{g_a(n)}`. The formula for the 4-point DFT is:\n`G(k) = sum_{n=0}^{3} g_a(n) * W_4^{nk}`, where `W_4 = e^{-j2Ï€/4} = -j`.\n\nThe twiddle factors are: `W_4^0=1`, `W_4^1=-j`, `W_4^2=-1`, `W_4^3=j`.\n\n*   **For k=0:**\n    `G(0) = g_a(0) + g_a(1) + g_a(2) + g_a(3) = 0 + 0.5 + 1 - 0.5 = 1`\n*   **For k=1:**\n    `G(1) = g_a(0)W_4^0 + g_a(1)W_4^1 + g_a(2)W_4^2 + g_a(3)W_4^3`\n    `G(1) = 0*(1) + 0.5*(-j) + 1*(-1) + (-0.5)*(j) = -0.5j - 1 - 0.5j = -1 - j`\n*   **For k=2:**\n    `G(2) = g_a(0)W_4^0 + g_a(1)W_4^2 + g_a(2)W_4^4 + g_a(3)W_4^6`\n    `G(2) = g_a(0) - g_a(1) + g_a(2) - g_a(3) = 0 - 0.5 + 1 - (-0.5) = -0.5 + 1 + 0.5 = 1`\n*   **For k=3:**\n    `G(3) = g_a(0)W_4^0 + g_a(1)W_4^3 + g_a(2)W_4^6 + g_a(3)W_4^9`\n    `G(3) = 0*(1) + 0.5*(j) + 1*(-1) + (-0.5)*(-j) = 0.5j - 1 + 0.5j = -1 + j`\n\nThe resulting 4-point DFT is `[1, -1-j, 1, -1+j]`.\n\n<<<[1, -1-j, 1, -1+j]>>>"
