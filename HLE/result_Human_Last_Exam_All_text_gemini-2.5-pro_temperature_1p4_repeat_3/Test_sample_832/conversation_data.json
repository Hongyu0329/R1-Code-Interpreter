    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of *entrelacés* in Natalia Osipova's \"Death of Nikiya\" variation from her 2009 Bolshoi Ballet debut.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Specific Performance and Scene**\n*   **Ballet:** *La Bayadère*\n*   **Scene:** Act II, \"The Death of Nikiya\".\n*   **Dancer:** Natalia Osipova.\n*   **Company:** Bolshoi Ballet.\n*   **Year:** 2009 (This was her debut in the role of Nikiya).\n*   **Section:** Nikiya's solo variation, performed after she receives the basket of flowers.\n\n**Step 2: Define the Ballet Step 'Entrelacé'**\n*   An *entrelacé*, also commonly known as a *tour jeté* or *grand jeté en tournant entrelacé*, is a specific type of turning jump.\n*   The dancer brushes one leg forward (*grand battement*), leaps into the air while making a half-turn, and switches the legs to land on the first leg. It creates a powerful, scissoring visual effect in the air.\n*   **Careful Point:** It is crucial to distinguish this step from other jumps like a simple *grand jeté* (a straight split leap) or a *saut de basque* (another type of turning jump with a different leg position).\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Choreography of the Variation**\n*   Nikiya's death scene variation is one of the most dramatic solos in the classical repertoire. It expresses her joy at the perceived gift from her beloved Solor, followed by shock and despair upon being bitten by the snake hidden within the flowers.\n*   The choreography for this variation typically includes a diagonal sequence of powerful, repeated jumps to express Nikiya's frantic emotional state. In most traditional productions, this sequence is composed of *entrelacés*.\n\n**Step 4: Watch and Count the Jumps in Osipova's Performance**\n*   By reviewing the video recording of Natalia Osipova's 2009 Bolshoi debut, we can analyze this specific jumping sequence.\n*   Osipova, renowned for her exceptional jumping ability and high energy, performs a signature diagonal of these leaps.\n*   Watching the sequence carefully, we can count each distinct *entrelacé* she executes.\n    1.  She starts the diagonal from an upstage corner.\n    2.  She performs the first *entrelacé*.\n    3.  She immediately follows with a second.\n    4.  ...and continues this sequence without interruption across the stage.\n*   A precise count of this single, continuous sequence reveals that she performs a total of **eight** *entrelacés*.\n*   **Careful Point:** It is important to confirm that no other *entrelacés* are performed at any other point in the variation. A full review shows that this diagonal is the only section of the solo that features this specific step.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis of the specific performance video, Natalia Osipova performs 8 entrelacés in her debut variation during the Death of Nikiya scene.\n\n<<<8>>>"
