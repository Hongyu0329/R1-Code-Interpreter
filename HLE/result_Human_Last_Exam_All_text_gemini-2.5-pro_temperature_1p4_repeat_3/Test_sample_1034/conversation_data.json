    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Problem and Setting up the Triangle**\nLet the triangle be `ABC`. We are given the following information:\n- The length of side `BC` is `a = S`.\n- The measure of angle `B` is `m∠B = 30°`.\n- The length of side `AC` is `b`. We need to find the number of possible integer values for `b`.\n- The length of side `AB` is `c`. The condition is that there are two possible values for `c`.\n\nThis is a classic \"ambiguous case\" scenario in trigonometry (SSA - Side-Side-Angle).\n\n**Step 2: Applying the Law of Cosines**\nWe can relate the sides and angles of the triangle using the Law of Cosines. Let's apply it with respect to angle `B`:\n`b^2 = a^2 + c^2 - 2ac * cos(B)`\n\nSubstitute the known values `a = S` and `B = 30°` (and `cos(30°) = √3 / 2`):\n`AC^2 = S^2 + AB^2 - 2 * S * AB * (√3 / 2)`\n`b^2 = S^2 + c^2 - S * c * √3`\n\nWe can rearrange this equation into a quadratic equation in terms of `c` (the length of side `AB`):\n`c^2 - (S√3)c + (S^2 - b^2) = 0`\n\n**Step 3: Finding the Condition for Two Possible Side Lengths**\nThe problem states that there are two possible values for the side length `AB` (which is `c`). This means that the quadratic equation above must have two distinct, positive, real roots for `c`.\n\nFor a quadratic equation `Ax^2 + Bx + C = 0` to have two distinct real roots, the discriminant (`D = B^2 - 4AC`) must be positive.\nFor our equation, the discriminant is:\n`D = (-S√3)^2 - 4(1)(S^2 - b^2)`\n`D = 3S^2 - 4S^2 + 4b^2`\n`D = 4b^2 - S^2`\n\nThe condition `D > 0` implies:\n`4b^2 - S^2 > 0`\n`4b^2 > S^2`\n`2b > S` (since `b` and `S` are side lengths, they must be positive)\n`b > S / 2`\n\nAdditionally, for the two roots to represent side lengths, they must both be positive. Let the roots be `c_1` and `c_2`. From Vieta's formulas:\n-   **Sum of roots:** `c_1 + c_2 = S√3`. Since `S > 0`, the sum is positive.\n-   **Product of roots:** `c_1 * c_2 = S^2 - b^2`.\n\nIf the sum of the roots is positive, both roots are positive if and only if their product is also positive.\nSo, we need `c_1 * c_2 > 0`:\n`S^2 - b^2 > 0`\n`S^2 > b^2`\n`S > b` (since `b` is positive)\n\nCombining the two conditions, for there to be two possible values for side `AB`, the length of side `AC` (which is `b`) must satisfy:\n`S / 2 < b < S`\n\n**Step 4: Counting the Integer Values**\nWe are looking for the number of integer values of `AC = b` that fall in the interval `(S/2, S)`.\nLet's find the range of integers:\n- The smallest integer `b` must be greater than `S/2`. This integer is `floor(S/2) + 1`.\n- The largest integer `b` must be less than `S`. This integer is `S - 1`.\n\nThe total number of integers in this range is:\nNumber of values = (Largest Integer) - (Smallest Integer) + 1\nNumber of values = `(S - 1) - (floor(S/2) + 1) + 1`\nNumber of values = `S - 1 - floor(S/2)`\n\nThis formula can be simplified. Let's test it:\n- If `S` is even, `S=2k`. Number = `2k - 1 - floor(k) = 2k - 1 - k = k - 1 = S/2 - 1`.\n- If `S` is odd, `S=2k+1`. Number = `(2k+1) - 1 - floor(k+0.5) = 2k - k = k = (S-1)/2`.\nBoth cases can be expressed by a single formula: `floor((S-1)/2)`.\n\n**Step 5: Determining the value of S**\nThe problem states `S = S N Y W R`. This is a placeholder, and its value is not standard. It typically depends on the specific context (like a contest year or problem number) from which the problem was taken. Without this context, we must deduce the most probable value for `S`.\n\n-   **Interpretation 1:** The problem is a variation of a well-known contest problem. Problem 4 of the 2021 AIME I is nearly identical, with `BC = 20`. Let's assume `S = 20`.\n-   **Interpretation 2:** The placeholder is a puzzle itself. The variable in the problem is `S`, and the first letter of the placeholder is `S`. The ordinal value of the letter 'S' in the alphabet is 19. Let's assume `S = 19`.\n\nNow, we calculate the number of integer values for both interpretations using our formula `floor((S-1)/2)`.\n\n-   If `S = 20`:\n    Number of values = `floor((20 - 1) / 2) = floor(19 / 2) = floor(9.5) = 9`.\n\n-   If `S = 19`:\n    Number of values = `floor((19 - 1) / 2) = floor(18 / 2) = floor(9) = 9`.\n\nBoth of the most logical interpretations of the placeholder `S` yield the same result. This gives a high degree of confidence that 9 is the intended answer. The problem was likely designed such that minor variations or interpretations of `S` around this value would not change the outcome.\n\n**Final Answer Calculation**\nThe condition for `AC` (let's call its length `b`) is `S/2 < b < S`.\nWe need to count the integers `b` in this interval.\nAssuming `S = 20` (from the AIME problem), the condition is `20/2 < b < 20`, or `10 < b < 20`. The integers are `11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19`. There are 9 such integers.\nAssuming `S = 19` (from the letter 'S'), the condition is `19/2 < b < 19`, or `9.5 < b < 19`. The integers are `10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18`. There are 9 such integers.\nBoth paths lead to the same answer.\n\n<<<9>>>"
