    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the area of the smallest square that circumscribes the given figure.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the parametric curve in two parts.**\n\nThe curve is defined by $x = \\cos t$ and $y = b \\sin t$. The value of $b$ depends on the interval of the parameter $t$.\n\n*   **Part 1: For $t \\in [0, \\pi]$, $b = 1$.**\n    The parametric equations are $x = \\cos t$ and $y = \\sin t$.\n    These equations satisfy the relation $x^2 + y^2 = \\cos^2 t + \\sin^2 t = 1$.\n    As $t$ goes from $0$ to $\\pi$, $\\sin t \\ge 0$, which means $y \\ge 0$.\n    This part of the curve is the upper semi-circle of the unit circle, centered at the origin, with a radius of 1. It starts at $(1, 0)$ (for $t=0$), passes through $(0, 1)$ (for $t=\\pi/2$), and ends at $(-1, 0)$ (for $t=\\pi$).\n\n*   **Part 2: For $t \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$, $b = 5$.**\n    The parametric equations are $x = \\cos t$ and $y = 5 \\sin t$.\n    These equations satisfy the relation $x^2 + (y/5)^2 = \\cos^2 t + \\sin^2 t = 1$.\n    As $t$ goes from $\\pi$ to $2\\pi$, $\\sin t < 0$, which means $y < 0$.\n    This part of the curve is the lower semi-ellipse, centered at the origin, with a semi-minor axis of 1 along the x-axis and a semi-major axis of 5 along the y-axis. It starts near $(-1, 0)$ (as $t \\to \\pi^+$), passes through $(0, -5)$ (for $t=3\\pi/2$), and ends near $(1, 0)$ (as $t \\to 2\\pi^-$).\n\n**Step 2: Determine the bounding box of the entire figure.**\n\nTo find the smallest square that encloses the figure, we first need to find the minimum and maximum values for the x and y coordinates over the entire range of $t \\in [0, 2\\pi)$. This will give us the dimensions of the smallest rectangle (bounding box) that contains the figure.\n\n*   **Finding the range of x:**\n    For the entire interval $t \\in [0, 2\\pi)$, the x-coordinate is given by $x = \\cos t$. The cosine function ranges from -1 to 1.\n    *   $x_{max} = 1$ (occurs at $t=0$)\n    *   $x_{min} = -1$ (occurs at $t=\\pi$)\n    The width of the figure is $x_{max} - x_{min} = 1 - (-1) = 2$.\n\n*   **Finding the range of y:**\n    We need to consider both parts of the curve.\n    *   For $t \\in [0, \\pi]$, $y = \\sin t$. The maximum value is $\\sin(\\pi/2) = 1$. The minimum value is 0. So, $y \\in [0, 1]$.\n    *   For $t \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$, $y = 5 \\sin t$. The minimum value is $5 \\times \\sin(3\\pi/2) = 5 \\times (-1) = -5$. The maximum value is 0. So, $y \\in [-5, 0)$.\n    *   Combining the two parts, the overall range for y is the union of $[-5, 0)$ and $[0, 1]$, which is $[-5, 1]$.\n    *   $y_{max} = 1$\n    *   $y_{min} = -5$\n    The height of the figure is $y_{max} - y_{min} = 1 - (-5) = 6$.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the side length of the smallest circumscribing square.**\n\nThe figure is contained within a rectangle of width 2 and height 6. A square that \"outcircles\" or circumscribes this figure must have a side length large enough to contain both the width and the height. Therefore, the side length of the smallest possible square must be equal to the larger of these two dimensions.\n\nSide length of the square = $\\max(\\text{width}, \\text{height}) = \\max(2, 6) = 6$.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the area of the square.**\n\nThe area of a square is the square of its side length.\nArea = (Side length)Â² = $6^2 = 36$.\n\n<<<36>>>"
