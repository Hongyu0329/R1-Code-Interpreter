    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of self-intersection points for the curve defined by the parametric equations (cos(9t), sin(5t)).\n\n**Step 1: Identify the type of curve and its parameters.**\nThe given curve is a Lissajous curve with parametric equations:\nx(t) = cos(at)\ny(t) = sin(bt)\nIn this specific case, the integer parameters are a = 9 and b = 5.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the properties of the parameters.**\n- The parameters 'a' and 'b' are a=9 and b=5.\n- We check if they are coprime. The greatest common divisor of 9 and 5 is GCD(9, 5) = 1. So, they are coprime.\n- We check their parity. Both 9 and 5 are odd numbers.\n\n**Step 3: Choose the correct formula for the number of self-intersections.**\nThe number of self-intersection points of a Lissajous curve depends critically on the parameters a, b, and the phase difference between the x and y components. The general form is often written as x(t) = A sin(at + φ) and y(t) = B sin(bt).\n\nOur curve can be written as:\nx(t) = cos(9t) = sin(9t + π/2)\ny(t) = sin(5t)\n\nThis corresponds to the general form with a=9, b=5, and a phase shift φ = π/2.\n\nFor Lissajous curves where 'a' and 'b' are coprime integers, there are established formulas:\n1.  **x=sin(at), y=sin(bt)**: If a and b have different parity, N = (a-1)(b-1)/2. If a and b are both odd, N = (a-1)(b-1).\n2.  **x=cos(at), y=cos(bt)**: If a and b are both odd, N = (ab-1)/2.\n3.  **x=cos(at), y=sin(bt)**: This is equivalent to x(t)=cos(at), y(t)=cos(bt - π/2). For the case where a and b are both odd and coprime, and the phase shift is a half-integer multiple of π (like ±π/2, ±3π/2, ...), the number of self-intersection points is given by the formula N = ab - 1.\n\nOur curve fits the third case precisely.\n\n**Step 4: Apply the formula to find the number of self-intersections.**\nUsing the formula N = ab - 1 with our parameters a = 9 and b = 5:\nN = (9 * 5) - 1\nN = 45 - 1\nN = 44\n\n**Step 5: Verification with a simpler case (optional but recommended).**\nLet's test the formula N = ab - 1 on a simpler case where a=3, b=1 (both odd and coprime).\nThe curve is x(t) = cos(3t), y(t) = sin(t). The formula predicts N = (3 * 1) - 1 = 2 self-intersections.\n\nWe can find the intersection points by hand for this case. Self-intersections occur on the y-axis (where x=0).\nx = cos(3t) = 0 when 3t = π/2 + kπ, which means t = π/6, π/2, 5π/6, 7π/6, 3π/2, 11π/6, ... within the interval [0, 2π).\nLet's evaluate y = sin(t) at these times:\n- t = π/6  -> y = sin(π/6) = 1/2\n- t = π/2  -> y = sin(π/2) = 1\n- t = 5π/6 -> y = sin(5π/6) = 1/2\n- t = 7π/6 -> y = sin(7π/6) = -1/2\n- t = 3π/2 -> y = sin(3π/2) = -1\n- t = 11π/6 -> y = sin(11π/6) = -1/2\n\nThe curve passes through the point (0, 1/2) at two different times, t = π/6 and t = 5π/6. This is one self-intersection point.\nThe curve passes through the point (0, -1/2) at two different times, t = 7π/6 and t = 11π/6. This is a second self-intersection point.\nThe total number of self-intersection points is 2. This matches the result from the formula, giving us confidence in its application.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nFor the curve (cos(9t), sin(5t)), the number of self-intersection points is calculated using the formula N = ab - 1, which gives N = 44.\n\n<<<44>>>"
