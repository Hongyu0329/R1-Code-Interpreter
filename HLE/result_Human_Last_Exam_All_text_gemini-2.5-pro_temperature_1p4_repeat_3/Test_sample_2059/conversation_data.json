    "An elegant explanation of the method to solve the problem step by step:\nLet the given polynomial be $P(x) = \\sum_k a_k x^k$. We are asked to find the value of $\\sum_k a_k^2$.\n\n**Step 1: Relate the sum of squares of coefficients to the polynomial**\n\nA standard technique to find the sum of squares of the coefficients of a polynomial $P(x) = \\sum_k a_k x^k$ (with real coefficients) is to compute the constant term of the product $P(x)P(1/x)$.\nLet's expand this product:\n$P(x)P(1/x) = \\left(\\sum_j a_j x^j\\right) \\left(\\sum_l a_l (1/x)^l\\right) = \\sum_{j,l} a_j a_l x^{j-l}$.\nThe constant term of this Laurent series is the sum of terms where the exponent is zero, which happens when $j=l$. So, the constant term is $\\sum_k a_k a_k = \\sum_k a_k^2$. Our goal is thus to find the constant term of $P(x)P(1/x)$.\n\n**Step 2: Simplify the expression for P(x)P(1/x)**\n\nThe polynomial is given by $P(x) = \\prod_{i=0}^{19}\\left( 1+x^{3^i}+x^{2\\cdot 3^i}+x^{3\\cdot 3^i}\\right)$.\nEach factor in the product is a geometric series sum $1+y+y^2+y^3$, where $y = x^{3^i}$.\nWe can factor this as $(1+y)(1+y^2)$.\nSo, $P(x) = \\prod_{i=0}^{19} (1+x^{3^i})(1+x^{2 \\cdot 3^i})$.\nNow we can write $P(x)P(1/x)$:\n$P(x)P(1/x) = \\left( \\prod_{i=0}^{19} (1+x^{3^i})(1+x^{2 \\cdot 3^i}) \\right) \\left( \\prod_{j=0}^{19} (1+x^{-3^j})(1+x^{-2 \\cdot 3^j}) \\right)$.\nWe can rearrange the product to group terms with the same index $i$:\n$P(x)P(1/x) = \\prod_{i=0}^{19} \\left[ (1+x^{3^i})(1+x^{-3^i}) \\cdot (1+x^{2\\cdot 3^i})(1+x^{-2\\cdot 3^i}) \\right]$.\nLet's expand the terms inside the square brackets for a fixed $i$:\n$(1+x^{3^i})(1+x^{-3^i}) = 1+x^{3^i}+x^{-3^i}+1 = 2+x^{3^i}+x^{-3^i}$.\n$(1+x^{2\\cdot 3^i})(1+x^{-2\\cdot 3^i}) = 2+x^{2\\cdot 3^i}+x^{-2\\cdot 3^i}$.\nLet $F_i(x) = (2+x^{3^i}+x^{-3^i})(2+x^{2\\cdot 3^i}+x^{-2\\cdot 3^i})$.\nWe need to find the constant term of the product $Q(x) = \\prod_{i=0}^{19} F_i(x)$.\nLet's expand $F_i(x)$:\n$F_i(x) = 4 + 2(x^{3^i}+x^{-3^i}) + 2(x^{2\\cdot 3^i}+x^{-2\\cdot 3^i}) + (x^{3^i}+x^{-3^i})(x^{2\\cdot 3^i}+x^{-2\\cdot 3^i})$.\nThe last term is $(x^{3^i\\cdot(1+2)} + x^{3^i\\cdot(1-2)} + x^{3^i\\cdot(-1+2)} + x^{3^i\\cdot(-1-2)}) = x^{3^{i+1}} + x^{-3^i} + x^{3^i} + x^{-3^{i+1}}$.\nSo, $F_i(x) = 4 + 3(x^{3^i}+x^{-3^i}) + 2(x^{2\\cdot 3^i}+x^{-2\\cdot 3^i}) + (x^{3^{i+1}}+x^{-3^{i+1}})$.\n\n**Step 3: Set up a recurrence relation for the constant term**\n\nThe constant term of $Q(x) = \\prod_{i=0}^{19} F_i(x)$ is found by summing the coefficients of all combinations of terms, one from each $F_i(x)$, whose exponents sum to zero.\nThe exponents of the terms in $F_i(x)$ are of the form $\\pm c \\cdot 3^k$ where $k=i$ or $k=i+1$. Due to the properties of base-3 representation, for the total exponent $\\sum_{i=0}^{19} e_i$ to be zero, there must be a cancellation of exponents between adjacent factors $F_i$ and $F_{i-1}$.\nThis structure leads to a recurrence relation. Let $u_k$ be the constant term contribution from the sub-product $\\prod_{i=k}^{19} F_i(x)$ assuming the term chosen from $F_{k-1}$ does not create a \"carry-over\" exponent term $x^{\\pm 3^k}$. Let $v_k$ be the contribution assuming it does.\nThis process yields a system of linear recurrence relations:\nLet $u_i$ be the sum of coefficient products for the tail $\\prod_{j=i}^{19} F_j(x)$ under the condition that the choice from $F_{i-1}$ has \"passed on\" a zero exponent contribution towards power $3^i$.\nLet $v_i$ be the sum of coefficient products when the choice from $F_{i-1}$ has passed on a non-zero exponent contribution (specifically $x^{\\pm 3^i}$).\nBy analyzing the coefficients in $F_i(x)$, we derive the relations for $i=1, ..., 18$:\n$u_i = 4u_{i+1} + 2v_{i+1}$\n$v_i = 3u_{i+1}$\nThe initial conditions are for $i=19$:\n$u_{19} = 4$\n$v_{19} = 3$\nThe final answer we seek is the constant term of the full product, which corresponds to the case starting at $i=0$. The initial condition is that there is no $F_{-1}$, so the initial state is \"zero carry-over\". The choices for $t_0$ are $4$ (passing $b_0=0$) or $x^{\\pm 3}$ (passing $b_0=\\pm 1$).\nThe total sum is $4 u_1 + 2 v_1$.\nWe can set up a single recurrence for $u_i$. Substituting $v_{i+1} = 3u_{i+2}$ into the first equation is incorrect as the indices don't match. Instead, substituting $v_i = 3u_{i+1}$ gives $u_{i-1} = 4u_i + 2v_i = 4u_i + 2(3u_{i+1}) = 4u_i + 6u_{i+1}$.\nLet's define a sequence $w_n$ representing the desired constant term for a product of $n+1$ factors ($i=0, ..., n$). So $w_n$ is the value computed based on the recurrence starting from $u_0$ and iterating $n$ times.\n$w_0 = u_{19} = 4$. (For the product with just $i=19$, constant term is 4).\nWait, this index mapping is confusing. Let's work forward.\nLet $w_n$ be the constant term for $\\prod_{i=0}^{n-1} \\dots$.\n$w_1 = 4$.\n$w_2 = 22$.\nLet $w_n$ be the constant term for the product $\\prod_{i=0}^{n-1}$. Let $W_n = \\begin{pmatrix} u_n \\\\ v_n \\end{pmatrix}$. $W_n = M W_{n+1}$.\nWe need the sum for $i=0...19$, which has 20 terms. This corresponds to the value $w_{20}$.\nLet $w_n$ be the result for a product of $n$ terms.\n$w_1 = 4$. For $\\prod_{i=0}^{0} \\implies$ ans=4.\n$w_2 = 22$. For $\\prod_{i=0}^{1} \\implies$ ans=22.\nLet's define the sequence $W_n$ starting from the end. Let $u_k, v_k$ be the constant terms for $\\prod_{i=k}^{19}$.\n$u_{19}=4, v_{19}=3$.\n$u_{18}=4u_{19}+2v_{19}=16+6=22$.\n$v_{18}=3u_{19}=12$.\n$u_{17}=4u_{18}+2v_{18}=4(22)+2(12)=88+24=112$.\nThe desired value is $u_0 = 4u_1+2v_1$. From the recurrence relations, we have $u_i = 4u_{i+1}+2v_{i+1}$ and $v_i=3u_{i+1}$.\nSo $v_1=3u_2$, and the sum is $4u_1+2(3u_2) = 4u_1+6u_2$.\nThe relation $u_{k-1} = 4u_k + 6u_{k+1}$ holds for $k \\ge 1$.\nSo we need to compute the sequence $u_{19}, u_{18}, \\dots, u_0$. Let's rename the sequence $z_n = u_{19-n}$.\n$z_0 = u_{19}=4$.\n$z_1 = u_{18}=22$.\nThe recurrence relation is $z_{n+2} = 4z_{n+1}+6z_n$.\nWe need to find $z_{19} = u_0$.\nLet's list the terms of the sequence:\n$z_0 = 4$\n$z_1 = 22$\n$z_2 = 4(22)+6(4) = 88+24 = 112$\n$z_3 = 4(112)+6(22) = 448+132 = 580$\n$z_4 = 4(580)+6(112) = 2320+672 = 2992$\n$z_5 = 4(2992)+6(580) = 11968+3480 = 15448$\n$z_6 = 4(15448)+6(2992) = 61792+17952 = 79744$\n$z_7 = 4(79744)+6(15448) = 318976+92688 = 411664$\n$z_8 = 4(411664)+6(79744) = 1646656+478464 = 2125120$\n$z_9 = 4(2125120)+6(411664) = 8500480+2469984 = 10970464$\n$z_{10} = 4(10970464)+6(2125120) = 43881856+12750720 = 56632576$\n$z_{11} = 4(56632576)+6(10970464) = 226530304+65822784 = 292353088$\n$z_{12} = 4(292353088)+6(56632576) = 1169412352+339795456 = 1509207808$\n$z_{13} = 4(1509207808)+6(292353088) = 6036831232+1754118528 = 7790949760$\n$z_{14} = 4(7790949760)+6(1509207808) = 31163799040+9055246848 = 40219045888$\n$z_{15} = 4(40219045888)+6(7790949760) = 160876183552+46745698560 = 207621882112$\n$z_{16} = 4(207621882112)+6(40219045888) = 830487528448+241314275328 = 1071801803776$\n$z_{17} = 4(1071801803776)+6(207621882112) = 4287207215104+1245731292672 = 5532938507776$\n$z_{18} = 4(5532938507776)+6(1071801803776) = 22131754031104+6430810822656 = 28562564853760$\n$z_{19} = 4(28562564853760)+6(5532938507776) = 114250259415040+33197631046656 = 147447890461696$\n\nThe sum of the squares of the coefficients is $z_{19}$.\n\n<<<147447890461696>>>"
