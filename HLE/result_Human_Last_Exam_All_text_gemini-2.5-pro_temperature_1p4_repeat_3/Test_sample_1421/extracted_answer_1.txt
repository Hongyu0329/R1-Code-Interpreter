The formula for the fermionic partition function Z is given by the functional path integral over anti-commuting Grassmann fields, $Z = \int D[\bar{\psi}, \psi] e^{-S_E[\bar{\psi}, \psi]}$. The Euclidean action, $S_E$, is defined as $S_E[\bar{\psi}, \psi] = \int_{0}^{\beta} d\tau \left[ \bar{\psi}(\tau) \partial_{\tau} \psi(\tau) + H(\bar{\psi}(\tau), \psi(\tau)) \right]$, where $H(\bar{\psi}, \psi)$ is the Hamiltonian expressed in terms of Grassmann fields. The integral is performed subject to anti-periodic boundary conditions: $\psi(\beta) = -\psi(0)$ and $\bar{\psi}(\beta) = -\bar{\psi}(0)$.
