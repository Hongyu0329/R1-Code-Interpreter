    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**1. Identify the type of differential equation**\nThe given differential equation is:\n$$ x'(t) = (t-1) \\cdot x^2(t) $$\nWe can rewrite $x'(t)$ as $\\frac{dx}{dt}$:\n$$ \\frac{dx}{dt} = (t-1)x^2 $$\nThis is a separable differential equation because we can group all terms involving $x$ on one side of the equation and all terms involving $t$ on the other side.\n\n**2. Separate the variables**\nTo separate the variables, we divide both sides by $x^2$ and multiply by $dt$.\n$$ \\frac{1}{x^2} dx = (t-1) dt $$\n**Careful Point:** When we divide by $x^2$, we assume $x \\neq 0$. We can check if $x(t)=0$ is a solution. If $x(t)=0$, then $x'(t)=0$. The right side of the equation becomes $(t-1) \\cdot 0^2 = 0$. So, $x(t)=0$ is a constant solution. However, our initial condition is $x(0)=-8$, which is not 0. Therefore, the solution we are seeking is not the trivial solution $x(t)=0$, and we can safely divide by $x^2$.\n\n**3. Integrate both sides**\nNow we integrate both sides of the separated equation:\n$$ \\int \\frac{1}{x^2} dx = \\int (t-1) dt $$\nLet's compute each integral:\n*   The integral of the left side is $\\int x^{-2} dx = \\frac{x^{-1}}{-1} = -\\frac{1}{x}$.\n*   The integral of the right side is $\\int (t-1) dt = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t$.\n\nCombining these results and adding a constant of integration, C, we get the general solution in implicit form:\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + C $$\n\n**4. Use the initial condition to find the constant C**\nThe initial condition is $x(0) = -8$. We substitute $t=0$ and $x=-8$ into the equation to solve for C.\n$$ -\\frac{1}{(-8)} = \\frac{(0)^2}{2} - (0) + C $$\n$$ \\frac{1}{8} = 0 - 0 + C $$\nSo, the constant of integration is $C = \\frac{1}{8}$.\n\n**5. Write the particular solution**\nNow, substitute the value of C back into the general solution to get the particular solution for this initial value problem:\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + \\frac{1}{8} $$\n\n**6. Find the value of x(1)**\nThe question asks for the value of $x(1)$. We substitute $t=1$ into our particular solution:\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{(1)^2}{2} - (1) + \\frac{1}{8} $$\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{1}{2} - 1 + \\frac{1}{8} $$\nTo simplify the right side, find a common denominator, which is 8:\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{4}{8} - \\frac{8}{8} + \\frac{1}{8} $$\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{4 - 8 + 1}{8} $$\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{-3}{8} $$\nNow, we can solve for $x(1)$. First, multiply both sides by -1:\n$$ \\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{3}{8} $$\nFinally, take the reciprocal of both sides to find $x(1)$:\n$$ x(1) = \\frac{8}{3} $$\n\n<<<8/3>>>"
