    "An involution in a group G is an element `x` of order 2, meaning `x^2 = 1` (where 1 is the identity element) and `x != 1`. We want to find the number of such elements in the projective special unitary group `PSU(4, 997)`.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Group PSU(4, 997)\n\n1.  **Notation**: The notation `PSU(n, q)` refers to the projective special unitary group defined over the finite field with `q^2` elements, `F_{q^2}`. So, `PSU(4, 997)` means `n=4` and `q=997`. The group is `PSU(4, 997^2)`.\n2.  **Definition**: The group `PSU(n, q^2)` is the quotient group `SU(n, q^2) / Z`, where `SU(n, q^2)` is the special unitary group and `Z` is its center.\n3.  **Special Unitary Group `SU(n, q^2)`**: This is the group of `n x n` matrices `A` with entries in `F_{q^2}` that satisfy two conditions:\n    *   `A` is unitary: `A * A^{*T} = I`, where `A^{*T}` is the conjugate transpose of `A` (conjugation is via the Frobenius automorphism `x -> x^q`).\n    *   `A` has determinant 1: `det(A) = 1`.\n4.  **Center `Z`**: The center of `SU(n, q^2)` consists of scalar matrices `cI` that are in `SU(n, q^2)`. The order of the center is `d = gcd(n, q+1)`.\n5.  **Our Specific Group**: For `PSU(4, 997^2)`, we have `n=4` and `q=997`.\n    *   The order of the center is `d = gcd(4, 997+1) = gcd(4, 998)`.\n    *   `998 = 2 * 499`. Since `4 = 2^2`, the greatest common divisor is `gcd(2^2, 2 * 499) = 2`.\n    *   So, the center `Z` has order 2. `Z = {I, -I}` where `I` is the 4x4 identity matrix.\n\n### Step 2: Characterizing Involutions in PSU(4, 997)\n\nAn element `t` in `PSU(4, q^2)` is an involution if `t^2` is the identity element of the quotient group, and `t` is not the identity.\n1.  Let `t = gZ` be a coset representing an element in `PSU(4, q^2)`, where `g` is a matrix in `SU(4, q^2)`.\n2.  The condition `t^2 = 1` translates to `(gZ)^2 = g^2 Z = Z`. This means `g^2` must be an element of the center `Z`. So, `g^2 = I` or `g^2 = -I`.\n3.  The condition `t != 1` translates to `gZ != Z`. This means `g` is not in the center `Z`. So, `g != I` and `g != -I`.\n4.  Therefore, we need to count the number of matrices `g` in `SU(4, 997^2)` such that `g` is not `I` or `-I`, and `g^2 = I` or `g^2 = -I`.\n5.  Let `C = { g in SU(4, q^2) | (g^2 = I \\text{ or } g^2 = -I) \\text{ and } g \\notin Z }`. The number of involutions in `PSU` is `|C| / |Z|`. Since `|Z|=2`, we need to find `|C|` and divide by 2.\n\n### Step 3: Counting the Pre-images `g`\n\nWe divide the problem into two cases for `g`.\n\n**Case 1: `g^2 = I` (where `g` is a non-central element in `SU(4, q^2)`)**\n*   These are the involutions of `SU(4, q^2)`. Such a `g` is diagonalizable, and its eigenvalues must be `+1` or `-1`.\n*   Let `k` be the multiplicity of the eigenvalue `+1`. Then `4-k` is the multiplicity of `-1`.\n*   Since `g` is in `SU`, its determinant is 1: `det(g) = (1)^k * (-1)^(4-k) = 1`. This requires `4-k` to be an even number, which means `k` must be even.\n*   Possible values for `k`: 0, 2, 4.\n    *   `k=0`: `g = -I`. This is in the center `Z`.\n    *   `k=4`: `g = I`. This is in the center `Z`.\n    *   `k=2`: The eigenvalues are `{1, 1, -1, -1}`. This corresponds to non-central involutions.\n*   These elements form a single conjugacy class in `SU(4, q^2)`. The number of such elements is given by the formula `|U(4, q^2)| / |U(2, q^2) x U(2, q^2)|`, which simplifies to `N_1 = q^4(q^2 - q + 1)(q^2 + 1)`.\n\n**Case 2: `g^2 = -I`**\n*   The eigenvalues of `g` must be roots of `x^2 + 1 = 0`, which are `i` and `-i`.\n*   We check if `i` and `-i` are in the base field `F_q = F_{997}`. This depends on whether -1 is a quadratic residue modulo `q`. We check the Legendre symbol `(-1/997)`. Since `997 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4` (as `997 = 4*249 + 1`), we have `(-1/997) = 1`. Thus, `i, -i` exist in `F_{997}`.\n*   For a unitary matrix `g` with `g^2=-I` in `U(n, q^2)` with `n` even and `q \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4`, its eigenvalues must be `i` (n/2 times) and `-i` (n/2 times). Here `n=4`, so the eigenvalues are `{i, i, -i, -i}`.\n*   `det(g) = i^2 * (-i)^2 = (-1) * (-1) = 1`. The `SU` condition is automatically satisfied.\n*   `g` cannot be a scalar matrix `cI`, since `(cI)^2 = -I` implies `c^2=-1`, but scalar matrices in `U(n,q^2)` require `c^{q+1}=1`. `i^{997+1}=i^{998}=(i^2)^{499}=(-1)^{499}=-1 \\neq 1`. So `g` is non-central.\n*   These elements form a single conjugacy class in `SU(4, q^2)`. The number of such elements is given by `|U(4, q^2)| / |GL(2, q^2)|`, which simplifies to `N_2 = q^4(q+1)^2(q^2 - q + 1)`.\n\n### Step 4: Final Calculation\n\n1.  The total number of pre-images not in the center is `|C| = N_1 + N_2`.\n    `|C| = q^4(q^2 - q + 1)(q^2 + 1) + q^4(q+1)^2(q^2 - q + 1)`\n2.  Factor out the common term `q^4(q^2 - q + 1)`:\n    `|C| = q^4(q^2 - q + 1) * [ (q^2 + 1) + (q+1)^2 ]`\n    `|C| = q^4(q^2 - q + 1) * [ q^2 + 1 + q^2 + 2q + 1 ]`\n    `|C| = q^4(q^2 - q + 1) * (2q^2 + 2q + 2)`\n    `|C| = 2 * q^4 * (q^2 - q + 1)(q^2 + q + 1)`\n3.  Using the identity `(a-b)(a+b) = a^2 - b^2` with `a=q^2+1, b=q`, we get `(q^2+1-q)(q^2+1+q) = (q^2+1)^2 - q^2 = q^4+2q^2+1-q^2 = q^4+q^2+1`.\n    `|C| = 2 * q^4 * (q^4 + q^2 + 1)`.\n4.  The number of involutions in `PSU(4, 997)` is `|C| / |Z| = |C| / 2`.\n    Number of involutions = `q^4 (q^4 + q^2 + 1)`.\n5.  Substitute `q = 997`:\n    *   `q^2 = 997^2 = 994,009`\n    *   `q^4 = (994,009)^2 = 988,053,848,081`\n    *   `q^4 + q^2 + 1 = 988,053,848,081 + 994,009 + 1 = 988,054,842,091`\n    *   Number of involutions = `988,053,848,081 * 988,054,842,091`\n    *   Number of involutions = `976,239,121,669,431,448,169,971`\n\n<<<976239121669431448169971>>>"
