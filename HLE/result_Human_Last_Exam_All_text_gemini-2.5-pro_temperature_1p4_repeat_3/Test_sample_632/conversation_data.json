    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstructing the Question**\nThe question asks for a specific \"unique architectural feature\" that existed in the \"Piazza della Rotonda\" in Rome, which was \"removed\" around \"1950\".\n\n**Step 2: Researching the History of Piazza della Rotonda**\nThe Piazza della Rotonda is the square directly in front of the Pantheon. Its main features today are the Pantheon itself and the Renaissance fountain in the center, the Fontana del Pantheon, which is topped by an ancient Egyptian obelisk. We need to look for features that are no longer there.\n\n**Step 3: Focusing on the late 19th and early 20th Century**\nThis period, especially after the unification of Italy in 1870, saw significant modernization in Rome. One of the key aspects of this modernization was the introduction of public transportation, including a network of tram lines.\n\n**Step 4: Identifying the \"Unique Architectural Feature\"**\nHistorical photographs and records from the late 19th century and the first half of the 20th century show that a tram line ran directly through the Piazza della Rotonda, passing between the fountain and the buildings on the side of the square. To serve the tram passengers, a shelter was constructed. This shelter was a large, ornate, cast-iron and glass canopy (in Italian, a \"pensilina\").\n\n**Step 5: Characterizing the Feature and its Uniqueness**\nThis cast-iron canopy was a product of the industrial age and was built in a typical Umbertine style (late 19th century). Its ornate metalwork and glass roof stood in stark contrast to the ancient granite columns of the Pantheon and the Renaissance stone of the fountain. This made it a \"unique\" and, to many later observers, an incongruous feature in the historic square. It was a clear symbol of the modern era being inserted into an ancient space.\n\n**Step 6: Confirming the Removal in 1950**\nAfter World War II, the city of Rome began a process of dismantling the tram network in the historic center. The motivation was twofold: to make way for increasing car and bus traffic, and to \"restore\" the original view of ancient monuments by removing what were considered unsightly modern additions. The tram line in Piazza della Rotonda and its distinctive cast-iron canopy were removed as part of this process. While the dismantling happened over a few years in the late 1940s, the year 1950 is commonly cited for the final removal of this specific structure.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe architectural feature in question was a large cast-iron and glass canopy that served as a shelter for a tram stop. It was a product of late 19th-century industrial architecture and was removed around 1950 to clear the view of the Pantheon and decommission the tram line.\n\n<<<A cast-iron and glass canopy for a tram stop>>>"
