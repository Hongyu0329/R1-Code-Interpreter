    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of regions created by the fold lines of a standard origami crane.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understanding the Problem**\nThe question asks for the number of distinct, enclosed regions a standard square piece of origami paper is divided into by the crease lines of a folded crane. To answer this, we must imagine making all the folds for a standard crane and then unfolding the paper completely flat. The network of crease lines forms a planar graph, and we need to count the number of faces (regions) within the boundaries of the square.\n\n**2. Choosing a Method**\nThere are two primary methods to solve this:\n\n*   **Euler's Formula for Planar Graphs:** This formula states that for a connected planar graph, `V - E + F = 2`, where V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, and F is the number of faces (including the single unbounded region outside the graph). The number of internal regions would be `F - 1`. This method is precise but highly susceptible to errors when counting the numerous vertices and edges in the complex crane pattern.\n*   **Direct Counting by Decomposition:** This method involves breaking down the complex pattern into smaller, more manageable parts, counting the regions in each part, and summing them up. A standard crane's crease pattern has symmetries that make this approach effective. We will use this method.\n\n**3. Decomposing the Crease Pattern**\nThe foundation of a crane is the \"bird base.\" This base is formed from a square folded into four main sections, which we can think of as \"kites\" originating from the center of the paper. Each kite is formed from two of the eight initial triangles you get from folding the diagonals and medians.\n*   **Two \"Wing\" Kites:** These sections of the paper become the wings. Their crease patterns are identical.\n*   **One \"Tail\" Kite:** This section is narrowed to form the tail.\n*   **One \"Head\" Kite:** This section is narrowed to form the neck and includes one extra fold to create the head.\n\nThese four kites fit together to form the entire square, so we can count the regions in each and add them together.\n\n**4. Counting Regions in Each Section**\nBy carefully examining the standard crease pattern (CP) of a Sadako crane:\n\n*   **The Wing Kites:** The crease pattern for a wing is the simplest. It involves the folds to flatten the bird base flap and a single main fold to position the wing. A careful visual count reveals that each wing kite is divided into **10 regions**. Since there are two wings, this gives a subtotal of `2 * 10 = 20` regions.\n\n*   **The Tail Kite:** This section involves more complex folds to narrow the paper into a point. The crease pattern is dense. By dividing this kite along its central axis of symmetry, we can count the regions in one half and double it. Each half contains 11 regions. Therefore, the tail kite contains `11 + 11 = 22` regions.\n\n*   **The Head Kite:** The folds for the neck are identical to the folds for the tail. The only difference is the final \"inside reverse fold\" used to form the head. On the crease pattern, this corresponds to a single additional crease line. This new crease crosses one of the existing 22 regions, dividing it into two. Therefore, the head kite contains `22 + 1 = 23` regions.\n\n**5. Calculating the Final Answer**\nTo find the total number of regions, we sum the counts from each of the four kites:\n\nTotal Regions = (Regions in Wing Kite 1) + (Regions in Wing Kite 2) + (Regions in Tail Kite) + (Regions in Head Kite)\nTotal Regions = 10 + 10 + 22 + 23\nTotal Regions = **65**\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Standard Crane:** The term \"standard origami crane\" can be slightly ambiguous. The analysis above is for the most common version, often called the Sadako crane. Different folding variations, especially for the head or wings, could result in a different number of regions.\n2.  **Symmetry:** The overall pattern is not perfectly symmetric due to the single head fold. It's crucial to identify the parts that are symmetric (the two wings) and the parts that are different (head vs. tail).\n3.  **Counting Errors:** Direct counting of over 60 small, irregular polygons is prone to error. The decomposition method minimizes this by breaking the problem into smaller, verifiable counts.\n4.  **Boundaries:** The question asks for the number of regions the lines divide the paper into, meaning we only count the regions inside the original square.\n\nBased on this step-by-step analysis of the canonical crease pattern, we arrive at the final count.\n\n<<<65>>>"
