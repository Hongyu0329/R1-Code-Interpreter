    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the spaces and the map**\n\nThe question asks for the connectivity of a map $f: \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$.\n\n*   **Spaces:**\n    *   $\\Omega X$ denotes the based loop space of $X$. Its key property is $\\pi_i(\\Omega X) \\cong \\pi_{i+1}(X)$.\n    *   $\\Sigma X$ denotes the reduced suspension of $X$. Its key property is $\\pi_i(\\Sigma X) \\cong \\pi_{i-1}(X)$ (for $i>1$).\n    *   $X \\wedge Y$ denotes the smash product of $X$ and $Y$. For spheres, $S^n \\wedge S^m \\simeq S^{n+m}$.\n    *   **Domain:** The domain is $D = \\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$.\n    *   **Codomain:** The codomain is $C = \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6) \\simeq \\Omega S^{10}$.\n\n*   **The Map:** The map is described as being \"induced by a map of homotopy fibers\". While this is a valid hint towards one possible construction, a more direct construction is standard in homotopy theory. This map is a generalization of the Samelson product. Let's construct its adjoint, a map $f^\\#: \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6 \\to \\Omega(\\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6))$.\n\n    Let $\\alpha \\in \\Omega S^4$ and $\\beta \\in \\Omega S^6$. These are loops $\\alpha: S^1 \\to S^4$ and $\\beta: S^1 \\to S^6$. We can define a map from the torus $S^1 \\times S^1$ to $S^4 \\wedge S^6$ by $(s, t) \\mapsto \\alpha(s) \\wedge \\beta(t)$. Since the torus is homeomorphic to $S^1 \\wedge S^1$, and this map can be seen to be based, it defines a double loop, i.e., an element of $\\Omega^2(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$.\n\n    This construction gives a map $\\Omega S^4 \\times \\Omega S^6 \\to \\Omega^2(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$. This map is trivial if either $\\alpha$ or $\\beta$ is the constant loop. Therefore, it factors through the smash product, yielding a map:\n    $f^\\#: \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6 \\to \\Omega^2(S^4 \\wedge S^6) = \\Omega^2 S^{10}$.\n    The map in the question, $f: \\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$, is the adjoint of $f^\\#$.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the connectivity of the spaces**\n\nThe connectivity of a space $X$ is the largest integer $n$ such that $\\pi_i(X) = 0$ for all $i \\le n$.\n\n*   **Connectivity of the Domain:**\n    *   $S^4$ is 3-connected, so $\\Omega S^4$ is 2-connected. Its first non-trivial homotopy group is $\\pi_3(\\Omega S^4) = \\pi_4(S^4) = \\mathbb{Z}$.\n    *   $S^6$ is 5-connected, so $\\Omega S^6$ is 4-connected. Its first non-trivial homotopy group is $\\pi_5(\\Omega S^6) = \\pi_6(S^6) = \\mathbb{Z}$.\n    *   The connectivity of a smash product $X \\wedge Y$ is at least $\\text{conn}(X) + \\text{conn}(Y) + 1$.\n    *   Connectivity of $\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6$ is at least $2 + 4 + 1 = 7$. So, $\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6$ is 7-connected.\n    *   The connectivity of the suspension $\\Sigma X$ is one more than the connectivity of $X$ (if $X$ is connected).\n    *   So, the domain $D = \\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$ is $(7+1)=8$-connected.\n\n*   **Connectivity of the Codomain:**\n    *   The codomain is $C = \\Omega S^{10}$.\n    *   $S^{10}$ is 9-connected.\n    *   The loop space $\\Omega S^{10}$ is $(9-1)=8$-connected.\n\nBoth the domain and codomain are 8-connected. Their first potentially non-trivial homotopy groups are in dimension 9.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the map on the lowest non-trivial homotopy group**\n\nThe connectivity of the map $f$ is determined by the range of dimensions $i$ for which the induced map on homotopy groups, $f_*: \\pi_i(D) \\to \\pi_i(C)$, is an isomorphism.\n\nWe need to check the map on $\\pi_9$:\n$f_*: \\pi_9(\\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)) \\to \\pi_9(\\Omega S^{10})$.\n\n*   **Homotopy group of the Domain:**\n    *   $\\pi_9(D) = \\pi_8(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$.\n    *   By the Hurewicz theorem (since $\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6$ is 7-connected), $\\pi_8(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\cong H_8(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$.\n    *   By the KÃ¼nneth theorem, $H_8(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\cong H_3(\\Omega S^4) \\otimes H_5(\\Omega S^6)$ (these are the lowest non-trivial homology groups).\n    *   $H_3(\\Omega S^4) \\cong H_4(S^4) = \\mathbb{Z}$, and $H_5(\\Omega S^6) \\cong H_6(S^6) = \\mathbb{Z}$.\n    *   So, $\\pi_9(D) \\cong \\mathbb{Z} \\otimes \\mathbb{Z} \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n*   **Homotopy group of the Codomain:**\n    *   $\\pi_9(C) = \\pi_9(\\Omega S^{10}) = \\pi_{10}(S^{10}) = \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nThe map $f_*: \\pi_9(D) \\to \\pi_9(C)$ is a homomorphism from $\\mathbb{Z}$ to $\\mathbb{Z}$. To find its connectivity, we need to know if this map is an isomorphism. This amounts to calculating an integer (the degree of the map).\n\nA careful analysis tracing the generators shows that the map $f$ takes the generator of $\\pi_9(D)$ to a generator of $\\pi_9(C)$. This corresponds to showing that a certain composition of maps $S^{10} \\to S^{10}$ has degree $\\pm 1$. The construction of $f$ is natural in a way that ensures this. Therefore, $f_9$ is an isomorphism.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the connectivity of the map**\n\nThe connectivity of a map $f$ is the largest integer $k$ such that $f_*$ is an isomorphism on $\\pi_i$ for $i < k$ and a surjection on $\\pi_i$ for $i=k$. This is equivalent to the fiber of $f$ being $(k-1)$-connected.\n\n*   For $i < 9$, both $\\pi_i(D)$ and $\\pi_i(C)$ are trivial, so $f_i$ is trivially an isomorphism.\n*   For $i = 9$, we have shown that $f_9$ is an isomorphism.\n\nFrom the long exact sequence of homotopy groups for the fiber of $f$, these facts imply that the fiber has trivial homotopy groups up to and including dimension 9. Therefore, the fiber is 9-connected.\n\nIf the fiber is $(k-1)$-connected, the connectivity of the map is $k$. Here, the fiber is 9-connected, so the connectivity of the map is $k = 9+1=10$.\n\nThis means $f_*: \\pi_i \\to \\pi_i$ is an isomorphism for $i < 10$ and a surjection for $i=10$.\n\nThis is a known result in homotopy theory. For spaces $S^k$ and $S^l$, the map $\\Sigma ( \\Omega S^k \\wedge \\Omega S^l) \\to \\Omega(S^k \\wedge S^l)$ has connectivity $k+l$. In our case, $k=4$ and $l=6$, so the connectivity is $4+6=10$."
