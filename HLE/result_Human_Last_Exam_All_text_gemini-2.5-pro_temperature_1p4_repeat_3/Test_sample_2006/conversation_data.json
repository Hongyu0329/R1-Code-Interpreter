    "This problem is a riddle hidden within a haiku. The goal is to decipher the clues in each line to find a set of words and then present them in a specific order.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Premise:** The core instruction is that the title, \"The Bays\", is a question. This is a pun, using a homophone. \"The Bays\" sounds like \"The B's\". Therefore, the question being asked by the title is, \"What are the B's?\". The haiku that follows must contain the clues to find three words that start with the letter 'B'.\n\n2.  **Analyze Line 1: \"An August tempest\"**\n    *   This line sets the theme of a powerful storm.\n    *   A \"tempest\" is a violent storm. In meteorology, a very rapidly intensifying storm is known as a \"bomb cyclone\" due to the process of \"bombogenesis\". The word \"bomb\" is a key term in this context.\n    *   This line's \"B\" word is **Bomb**.\n\n3.  **Analyze Line 2: \"Twice fifteen brings winds of change\"**\n    *   This line contains a mathematical clue. \"Twice fifteen\" is 2 * 15 = 30.\n    *   The clue connects this number to \"winds\". Wind force is famously measured on a scale.\n    *   The **Beaufort** scale is used to measure wind speed. A wind of around 30 mph/knots corresponds to a Force 7 (Near Gale) on this scale. The scale's name is the answer.\n    *   This line's \"B\" word is **Beaufort**.\n\n4.  **Analyze Line 3: \"A divine one yields\"**\n    *   This line points to a mythological figure. \"A divine one\" refers to a god.\n    *   Considering the theme of tempests and wind, we should look for a god of wind.\n    *   In Greek mythology, **Boreas** is the powerful god of the North Wind, who brings the cold air of winter and is associated with storms.\n    *   This line's \"B\" word is **Boreas**.\n\n5.  **Synthesize and Order the Answer**\n    *   We have found the three \"B's\": Bomb, Beaufort, and Boreas.\n    *   The question asks for the answer \"in alphabetical order\".\n    *   Arranging our three words alphabetically gives us: Beaufort, Bomb, Boreas.\n\n**Final Answer Derivation**\nThe question is \"What are the B's?\". The haiku provides three clues leading to three words starting with B, all related to the theme of storms.\n*   Line 1 -> \"tempest\" -> **Bomb** (from bomb cyclone)\n*   Line 2 -> \"Twice fifteen\" (30) + \"winds\" -> **Beaufort** (the wind scale)\n*   Line 3 -> \"A divine one\" (a god) + wind theme -> **Boreas** (the Greek wind god)\nIn alphabetical order, the answer is Beaufort, Bomb, Boreas.\n\n<<<Beaufort, Bomb, Boreas>>>"
