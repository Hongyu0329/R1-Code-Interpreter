    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Integral and the Question\n\nThe given integral is:\n$I(a_1, \\dots, a_9) = \\int_{[0, 1]^2} e^{2\\pi i P(x, y; a)} dxdy$\nwhere $a = (a_1, \\dots, a_9) \\in \\mathbb{R}^9$ and $P(x, y; a)$ is a polynomial of degree 3 in two variables $x, y$:\n$P(x, y; a) = a_1 x+a_2 y + a_3 x^2 + a_4 xy + a_5 y^2 + a_6 x^3 + a_7 x^2 y + a_8 x y^2 + a_9 y^3$.\n\nThe question asks for the largest value of $p$ such that the function $I(a)$ is not in $L^p(\\mathbb{R}^9)$. This means we are looking for the supremum of the set of $p$ for which the following integral diverges:\n$\\int_{\\mathbb{R}^9} |I(a)|^p da = \\infty$.\n\nThis value, let's call it $p_c$, is a critical exponent. For $p \\le p_c$, the function $I$ is not in $L^p$, and for $p > p_c$, the function $I$ is in $L^p$. We need to find $p_c$.\n\n### Step 2: Reformulating the problem using Fourier Analysis\n\nThe integral $I(a)$ can be interpreted as the Fourier transform of a measure.\nLet the surface $S$ in $\\mathbb{R}^9$ be parameterized by $\\Phi(x,y)$:\n$\\Phi(x,y) = (x, y, x^2, xy, y^2, x^3, x^2y, xy^2, y^3)$ for $(x,y) \\in [0,1]^2$.\nLet $d\\mu$ be the measure on this surface obtained by lifting the Lebesgue measure $dxdy$ from $[0,1]^2$ to $S$.\nThe integral can be written as:\n$I(a) = \\int_{[0,1]^2} e^{2\\pi i (a \\cdot \\Phi(x,y))} dxdy = \\int_S e^{2\\pi i (a \\cdot v)} d\\mu(v)$\nwhere $v = \\Phi(x,y) \\in S$.\nThis is precisely the definition of the Fourier transform of the measure $\\mu$, evaluated at $-a$:\n$I(a) = \\widehat{d\\mu}(-a)$.\n\nThe problem is now transformed into finding the range of $p$ for which the Fourier transform of the measure $\\mu$ is in $L^p(\\mathbb{R}^9)$.\n\n### Step 3: Applying the Theory of Fourier Transforms on Manifolds\n\nThere is a well-developed theory concerning the $L^p$ properties of Fourier transforms of measures supported on manifolds. A key result, an extension of the Tomas-Stein restriction theorem, states that for a measure compactly supported on a $k$-dimensional submanifold of $\\mathbb{R}^n$ with non-vanishing Gaussian curvature, its Fourier transform belongs to $L^p(\\mathbb{R}^n)$ if and only if $p > \\frac{2n}{k}$.\n\nIn our problem:\n*   The dimension of the ambient space is $n=9$.\n*   The dimension of the manifold (the surface $S$) is $k=2$.\n*   The measure is supported on the image of $[0,1]^2$, which is a compact set.\n\nWe need to check if the surface $S$ has non-vanishing Gaussian curvature. The curvature is non-vanishing if for a generic direction $\\eta \\in \\mathbb{R}^9$, the height function $\\eta \\cdot \\Phi(x,y)$ has non-degenerate critical points. The Hessian of this height function is:\n$H(x,y) = \\begin{pmatrix} 2\\eta_3 + 6\\eta_6 x + 2\\eta_7 y & \\eta_4 + 2\\eta_7 x + 2\\eta_8 y \\\\ \\eta_4 + 2\\eta_7 x + 2\\eta_8 y & 2\\eta_5 + 2\\eta_8 x + 6\\eta_9 y \\end{pmatrix}$.\nThe determinant of this Hessian is a quadratic polynomial in $x$ and $y$. It is not identically zero. For instance, if we choose $\\eta = (0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0)$, then $\\det(H) = 4$. This means the surface has non-vanishing Gaussian curvature almost everywhere.\n\nTherefore, the critical exponent is given by the formula:\n$p_c = \\frac{2n}{k} = \\frac{2 \\times 9}{2} = 9$.\n\nSo, $I(a) = \\widehat{d\\mu}(-a)$ is in $L^p(\\mathbb{R}^9)$ if and only if $p > 9$.\n\n### Step 4: Confirming with a Scaling Argument\n\nWe can reach the same conclusion using a scaling argument on the decay of the integral $I(a)$ for large $|a|$.\nThe magnitude of the integral $I(a)$ is primarily determined by the stationary points of the phase $P(x,y;a)$. For a generic choice of coefficients $a$, the phase function has non-degenerate stationary points inside the domain $[0,1]^2$.\nLet's consider the behavior of $I(\\lambda \\omega)$ for a fixed direction $\\omega \\in S^8$ and large $\\lambda > 0$. So $a = \\lambda \\omega$.\n$I(\\lambda \\omega) = \\int_{[0,1]^2} e^{2\\pi i \\lambda (\\omega \\cdot \\Phi(x,y))} dxdy$.\nBy the method of stationary phase for a 2-dimensional integral, if the phase has non-degenerate critical points, the integral decays as $\\lambda^{-2/2} = \\lambda^{-1}$.\nSo, for almost all directions $\\omega$, we have $|I(\\lambda \\omega)| \\sim C(\\omega)\\lambda^{-1}$ for large $\\lambda$.\n\nNow, we evaluate the $L^p$ norm in polar coordinates, $da = r^8 dr d\\sigma(\\omega)$, where $r = |a|$:\n$\\int_{\\mathbb{R}^9} |I(a)|^p da = \\int_{S^8} \\int_0^\\infty |I(r\\omega)|^p r^8 dr d\\sigma(\\omega)$.\n\nSubstituting the generic decay rate:\n$\\approx \\int_{S^8} \\int_1^\\infty (C(\\omega)r^{-1})^p r^8 dr d\\sigma(\\omega) = \\left(\\int_{S^8} |C(\\omega)|^p d\\sigma(\\omega)\\right) \\left(\\int_1^\\infty r^{8-p} dr\\right)$.\nThe integral with respect to $r$ converges if the exponent $8-p$ is less than $-1$, and diverges if it is greater than or equal to $-1$.\nConvergence condition: $8 - p < -1 \\implies p > 9$.\nDivergence condition: $8 - p \\ge -1 \\implies p \\le 9$.\n\nThe set of directions $\\omega$ where the decay is slower than $r^{-1}$ (due to degenerate stationary points) corresponds to a subvariety of $S^8$ of measure zero. Thus, these directions do not change the convergence/divergence of the integral over the whole space. The overall behavior is governed by the generic decay rate.\n\n### Step 5: Final Conclusion\n\nThe integral $\\int_{\\mathbb{R}^9} |I(a)|^p da$ diverges for $p \\le 9$ and converges for $p > 9$.\nThe question asks for the largest $p$ such that the function $I$ is *not* in $L^p(\\mathbb{R}^9)$. This corresponds to the region of divergence, $p \\le 9$.\nThe largest value of $p$ in this set is $9$."
