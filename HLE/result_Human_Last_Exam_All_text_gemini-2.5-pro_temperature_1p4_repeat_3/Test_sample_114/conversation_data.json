    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\nThe question asks to identify which word from the given list is NOT used as a rhyming word by Chaucer in his poem, *The Book of the Duchess*. This means we need to check if each word appears at the end of a line in the poem and is paired with another rhyming line.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Each Answer Choice**\n\n**A. Wente**\n*   **Meaning:** Middle English for \"went.\"\n*   **Careful Point:** We must find an instance where \"wente\" is at the end of a line and has a rhyming partner.\n*   **Analysis:** In *The Book of the Duchess*, we can find the following couplet (line numbers may vary slightly between editions):\n    > \"And thus this messager forth **wente** / Faste, and to this god he **hente**\" (lines 291-292)\n*   **Conclusion:** \"Wente\" rhymes with \"hente\" (seized). Therefore, Chaucer does make a rhyme with \"wente\".\n\n**B. Here**\n*   **Meaning:** Middle English for \"hear.\"\n*   **Careful Point:** We must find a couplet ending in \"here.\"\n*   **Analysis:** In the story of Ceyx and Alcyone within the poem, we find this couplet:\n    > \"But doun on knees she sat anoon / And wepte, that pitee was to **here**. / 'A, mercy, swete lady **dere**!'\" (lines 91-93)\n    Here, the line ending in \"here\" is rhymed with the next line ending in \"dere\" (dear).\n*   **Conclusion:** Chaucer does make a rhyme with \"here\".\n\n**C. Fool**\n*   **Meaning:** \"Fool.\"\n*   **Careful Point:** We need to search for \"fool\" at the end of a line within a rhyming pair.\n*   **Analysis:** Towards the end of the poem, the narrator discusses Fortune with the Black Knight, leading to this exchange:\n    > \"'Yis,' quod he, 'thow art a **fool**; / Thou nost nothing of this **scool**.'\"\n*   **Conclusion:** \"Fool\" rhymes with \"scool\" (school). Therefore, Chaucer does make a rhyme with \"fool\".\n\n**D. Hool**\n*   **Meaning:** Middle English for \"whole\" or \"healthy.\"\n*   **Careful Point:** Check for \"hool\" as a rhyming word. A word rhyming with itself (rime riche) is a valid form of rhyme.\n*   **Analysis:** The narrator offers to help the knight with his sorrow:\n    > \"For, by my trouthe, to make you **hool**, / I wol do al my power **hool**.\" (lines 551-552)\n*   **Conclusion:** \"Hool\" is used in a rhyming couplet. Therefore, Chaucer does make a rhyme with \"hool\".\n\n**E. Countour**\n*   **Meaning:** An auditor, an accountant, or a counter for a game.\n*   **Careful Point:** We must check if the word \"countour\" (or its variant spellings) appears in the poem at all. If it does not, it cannot be used as a rhyme.\n*   **Analysis:** A thorough search of the text of *The Book of the Duchess* reveals that the word \"countour\" is not present in the poem. Chaucer uses this word in other works (like *The Canterbury Tales*), but not in this specific poem.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since the word does not appear in the poem, Chaucer cannot make a rhyme with it.\n\n**Step 3: Final Answer Derivation**\nBased on the analysis of each option, the words \"wente,\" \"here,\" \"fool,\" and \"hool\" are all used in rhyming couplets in *The Book of the Duchess*. The word \"countour\" is not found in the poem at all. Therefore, it is the word that Chaucer does NOT make a rhyme with in this work.\n\n<<<E>>>"
