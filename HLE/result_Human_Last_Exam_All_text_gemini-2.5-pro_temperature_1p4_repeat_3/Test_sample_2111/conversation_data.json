    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Key Figures:** The question names two individuals: Fernand Braudel, a prominent historian known for his work on global history and the *longue durée*, and Paul Morand, a writer whom Braudel quotes. The core of the question lies in a concept Braudel borrowed from Morand.\n\n2.  **Deconstruct the Central Metaphor:** The key phrase is that a conceptual entity should be \"inscribed within a sphere.\"\n    *   **\"A sphere\":** In the context of Braudel's \"global historical perspective,\" the sphere is a clear metaphor for the globe or the world.\n    *   **\"Inscribed within\":** This action implies placing something into a larger context, seeing it not as an isolated unit but as part of a complete, interconnected system (the globe).\n\n3.  **Analyze the Example:** The question states that this conceptual entity is \"exemplified by the symbol of a nation.\" This means the nation itself is not the entity, but an example or the subject of this entity. The entity is something *related* to the nation.\n\n4.  **Locate the Original Quote:** The quote appears in Fernand Braudel's major work, *Civilization and Capitalism, 15th–18th Century*, specifically in Volume 3, *The Perspective of the World*. Braudel uses the quote to set up his argument for studying history on a global scale, moving beyond the confines of the nation-state.\n\n5.  **Reveal the Full Assertion:** The actual assertion by Paul Morand that Braudel quotes is: \"every **national history** must be inscribed on a sphere\" (or \"chaque **histoire nationale** doit être inscrite sur une sphère\").\n\n6.  **Synthesize and Conclude:**\n    *   The \"conceptual entity\" is the object that needs to be \"inscribed.\"\n    *   The subject of this entity is the \"nation.\"\n    *   The full quote reveals that the entity being discussed is the **history** of the nation.\n    *   Therefore, the entity is **national history**. Braudel's point is that the history of any single nation is incomplete and incomprehensible unless it is placed within the broader context of world history and global economic systems.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Distinguishing the entity from its example:** The question is carefully worded. The entity is *exemplified* by the nation, meaning the nation is the subject, not the entity itself. The entity is the *narrative or study* of the nation.\n*   **Understanding Braudel's perspective:** Braudel's entire project was to write a \"total history\" that transcended national boundaries. He used this quote to support his own methodological approach, arguing against the traditional, nation-centric historiography of the 19th century.\n*   **The source of the quote:** Acknowledging that Braudel is quoting Morand is important. Braudel is using a literary image to make a historical argument.\n\nBy following these steps, we can confidently identify the conceptual entity in question.\n\n<<<national history>>>"
