    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the question:** The question asks for the title of a novel based on two specific clues given by the writer Jorge Luis Borges:\n    *   **Clue 1 (A description of the novel):** It possesses \"the intensity of a tiger and the variety that a chess duel can achieve.\"\n    *   **Clue 2 (A description of the author):** The author is a \"continuator (and simplifier) of Faulkner.\"\n\n2.  **Analyze Clue 2: The Author:** The description of the author as a \"continuator (and simplifier) of Faulkner\" is a major pointer. William Faulkner was a huge influence on the Latin American Boom writers. His techniques—non-linear narratives, multiple points of view, stream of consciousness, and mythic treatment of place—were adapted by many. However, the key word is \"simplifier.\" Faulkner's prose is famously dense and complex. We are looking for an author who took Faulkner's structural ideas and themes but executed them in a more concise, sparse, or direct style.\n    *   Among the great Latin American writers, **Juan Rulfo** is the most prominent figure who fits this description. His style is famously minimalist and poetic, a stark contrast to Faulkner's verbosity, yet his novel *Pedro Páramo* clearly uses Faulknerian techniques like fragmented timelines and a chorus of voices to tell its story.\n\n3.  **Analyze Clue 1: The Novel:** The description \"the intensity of a tiger and the variety that a chess duel can achieve\" needs to be matched to a specific work.\n    *   **\"The intensity of a tiger\":** This suggests a work that is fierce, raw, and powerful in its emotional impact. It is not tame or gentle.\n    *   **\"The variety that a chess duel can achieve\":** This is a brilliant metaphor for a work that is highly structured and intricate, despite appearing to have a limited set of components (like chess pieces). The complexity comes from the interaction and arrangement of these parts. It implies a narrative that is a calculated puzzle.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Clues and Identify the Novel:** Let's apply these descriptions to Juan Rulfo's masterpiece, **Pedro Páramo**.\n    *   The novel is incredibly intense. It's a haunting ghost story about a man visiting his dead mother's hometown, Comala, only to find it populated by the voices and memories of the dead. Its themes of purgatory, violence, and desolation are visceral and powerful, matching the \"intensity of a tiger.\"\n    *   The structure of *Pedro Páramo* is legendary for its complexity. The narrative is fragmented, jumping between the protagonist's journey and flashbacks from multiple perspectives, often without warning. The reader must piece together the story like a puzzle, understanding the relationships and timeline from scattered clues. This intricate, calculated structure perfectly embodies the \"variety that a chess duel can achieve.\"\n\n5.  **Final Confirmation:** Jorge Luis Borges wrote a famous prologue for a collected edition of Juan Rulfo's works. In this prologue, he specifically analyzes *Pedro Páramo*, calling it one of the best novels in Hispanic literature. It is in this very text that he makes the two comments mentioned in the question: he notes Rulfo's connection to Faulkner and praises the novel's structure and power with the \"tiger\" and \"chess\" metaphor.\n\nTherefore, the novel Borges is referring to is *Pedro Páramo* by Juan Rulfo.\n\n<<<Pedro Páramo>>>"
