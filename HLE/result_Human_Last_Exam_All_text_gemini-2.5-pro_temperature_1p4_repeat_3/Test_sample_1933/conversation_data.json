    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the VC dimension of $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem and Defining the Concept Class\n\nFirst, we need to understand all the components of the question.\n- **Schema S**: The schema $S$ consists of 4 unary predicates, let's call them $P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4$. A structure (or model) $\\mathcal{A}$ over this schema will have a universe $U$ and interpretations for these predicates, which are subsets of the universe: $P_1^{\\mathcal{A}}, P_2^{\\mathcal{A}}, P_3^{\\mathcal{A}}, P_4^{\\mathcal{A}} \\subseteq U$.\n- **Logic Fragment $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$**: This is a fragment of first-order logic. Formulas in this fragment are constructed using only the existential quantifier ($\\exists$), conjunction ($\\land$), the constants true ($\\top$) and false ($\\bot$), and atomic formulas from the schema $S$. An atomic formula with a free variable $x$ is of the form $P_i(x)$. We are interested in formulas with exactly one free variable, say $x$, as these define concepts (subsets of the universe).\n- **VC Dimension**: The VC dimension of a concept class is the maximum size $d$ of a set $X$ that can be \"shattered\" by the class. A set $X$ is shattered if for every subset $Y \\subseteq X$, there is a concept $C$ in the class such that $C \\cap X = Y$.\n\nThe crucial part is defining the concept class. The phrasing \"VC dimension of a logic\" can be ambiguous. Two common interpretations are:\n1.  The concept class consists of all sets definable by a formula in the logic, where one can choose both the formula and the underlying structure. This typically leads to an infinite VC dimension for most logics, as one can tailor the structure to define any desired subset.\n2.  The concept class is defined with respect to a fixed, but arbitrary, structure $\\mathcal{A}$. The VC dimension of the logic is then the supremum of the VC dimensions of these concept classes over all possible structures $\\mathcal{A}$. This is the standard interpretation in the context of PAC learning and computational learning theory, as it leads to meaningful finite values.\n\nWe will adopt the second, more standard interpretation as it is the only one that yields a finite answer.\n\nUnder this interpretation, the concept class for a fixed structure $\\mathcal{A}$ is:\n$\\mathcal{H}_{\\mathcal{A}} = \\{ \\{a \\in U \\mid \\mathcal{A} \\models \\phi(a) \\} \\mid \\phi(x) \\in \\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S] \\}$\nThe VC dimension of the logic is $\\sup_{\\mathcal{A}} \\mathrm{VCdim}(\\mathcal{H}_{\\mathcal{A}})$.\n\n### Step 2: Characterizing the Concepts in $\\mathcal{H}_{\\mathcal{A}}$\n\nLet's analyze the structure of any formula $\\phi(x)$ in our logic fragment. Due to the absence of binary predicates (like equality '=') or constants, variables in the formula cannot be related to each other.\nAny formula $\\phi(x)$ can be put into an equivalent prenex normal form:\n$\\phi(x) \\equiv \\exists y_1 \\dots \\exists y_k \\psi(x, y_1, \\dots, y_k)$\nwhere $\\psi$ is a quantifier-free formula. Since only $\\land$ is allowed, $\\psi$ is a conjunction of atomic formulas.\nAn atomic formula is of the form $P_j(z)$ where $z \\in \\{x, y_1, \\dots, y_k\\}$. So $\\psi$ can be written as:\n$\\psi(x, \\vec{y}) = (\\bigwedge_{i \\in I_0} P_{j_i}(x)) \\land (\\bigwedge_{l=1}^k \\bigwedge_{i \\in I_l} P_{k_{i,l}}(y_l))$\nLet's group the terms: $A(x) = \\bigwedge_{i \\in I_0} P_{j_i}(x)$ and $B_l(y_l) = \\bigwedge_{i \\in I_l} P_{k_{i,l}}(y_l)$.\nThen $\\phi(x) \\equiv \\exists y_1 \\dots \\exists y_k (A(x) \\land B_1(y_1) \\land \\dots \\land B_k(y_k))$.\nSince $A(x)$ does not contain any $y_l$, we can pull it out of the quantifiers:\n$\\phi(x) \\equiv A(x) \\land (\\exists y_1 B_1(y_1)) \\land \\dots \\land (\\exists y_k B_k(y_k))$.\nLet $\\theta = (\\exists y_1 B_1(y_1)) \\land \\dots \\land (\\exists y_k B_k(y_k))$. Note that $\\theta$ is a sentence (it has no free variables).\nFor a given structure $\\mathcal{A}$, $\\theta$ is either true or false.\n- If $\\mathcal{A} \\models \\theta$, then $\\phi(x)$ is equivalent to $A(x)$. The defined concept is $\\{a \\in U \\mid \\mathcal{A} \\models A(a)\\} = \\bigcap_{i \\in I_0} P_{j_i}^{\\mathcal{A}}$.\n- If $\\mathcal{A} \\not\\models \\theta$, then $\\phi(x)$ is equivalent to $\\bot$. The defined concept is the empty set $\\emptyset$.\n\nSo, for any fixed structure $\\mathcal{A}$, the concepts in $\\mathcal{H}_{\\mathcal{A}}$ are intersections of some of the base predicate interpretations $P_1^{\\mathcal{A}}, P_2^{\\mathcal{A}}, P_3^{\\mathcal{A}}, P_4^{\\mathcal{A}}$. The whole universe $U$ is definable by $\\top$ (an empty intersection), and the empty set is definable by $\\bot$.\nConversely, any intersection of the form $\\bigcap_{i \\in I} P_i^{\\mathcal{A}}$ for $I \\subseteq \\{1,2,3,4\\}$ is definable by the formula $\\phi(x) = \\bigwedge_{i \\in I} P_i(x)$, which belongs to our logic fragment.\nTherefore, the concept class for a structure $\\mathcal{A}$ is precisely the set of all possible intersections of the base sets:\n$\\mathcal{H}_{\\mathcal{A}} = \\{ \\bigcap_{i \\in I} P_i^{\\mathcal{A}} \\mid I \\subseteq \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\} \\}$.\n\n### Step 3: Computing the VC Dimension\n\nWe need to find the VC dimension of the concept class of intersections of 4 sets. This is a classic result in VC theory. Let $k=4$ be the number of predicates.\n\n**Upper Bound:**\nLet's find an upper bound on the VC dimension. A concept is determined by choosing a subset of the 4 predicates to include in the intersection. There are $2^4 = 16$ such subsets of predicates. Thus, for any given structure $\\mathcal{A}$, the class $\\mathcal{H}_{\\mathcal{A}}$ can contain at most 16 distinct concepts.\nTo shatter a set of size $d$, one must be able to generate all $2^d$ of its subsets. So, we need $2^d \\le |\\mathcal{H}_{\\mathcal{A}}| \\le 16$. This implies $d \\le 4$.\nSo, the VC dimension is at most 4.\n\n**Lower Bound:**\nTo show the VC dimension is at least 4, we must demonstrate that there exists a structure $\\mathcal{A}$ and a set $X$ of size 4 that can be shattered by $\\mathcal{H}_{\\mathcal{A}}$.\nLet's choose the universe to be the set we want to shatter, $X = \\{x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4\\}$.\nNow, we define the interpretations of the predicates $P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4$ as subsets of $X$. A standard construction is to make each point in $X$ a unique \"omission\" from the predicates. Let's define $P_i^{\\mathcal{A}} = X \\setminus \\{x_i\\}$ for $i=1, 2, 3, 4$.\nSo we have:\n- $P_1^{\\mathcal{A}} = \\{x_2, x_3, x_4\\}$\n- $P_2^{\\mathcal{A}} = \\{x_1, x_3, x_4\\}$\n- $P_3^{\\mathcal{A}} = \\{x_1, x_2, x_4\\}$\n- $P_4^{\\mathcal{A}} = \\{x_1, x_2, x_3\\}$\n\nNow we need to show that for any subset $Y \\subseteq X$, there exists a set of indices $I \\subseteq \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$ such that $Y = \\bigcap_{i \\in I} P_i^{\\mathcal{A}}$.\nLet $Y$ be an arbitrary subset of $X$. Let $I_Y = \\{ i \\mid x_i \\notin Y \\}$. We claim that $Y = \\bigcap_{i \\in I_Y} P_i^{\\mathcal{A}}$.\nLet's prove this. An element $x_j \\in X$ belongs to the intersection $\\bigcap_{i \\in I_Y} P_i^{\\mathcal{A}}$ if and only if $x_j \\in P_i^{\\mathcal{A}}$ for all $i \\in I_Y$.\nBy our definition of $P_i^{\\mathcal{A}}$, $x_j \\in P_i^{\\mathcal{A}}$ if and only if $j \\neq i$.\nSo, $x_j \\in \\bigcap_{i \\in I_Y} P_i^{\\mathcal{A}}$ if and only if $j \\neq i$ for all $i \\in I_Y$.\nThis is equivalent to saying that $j \\notin I_Y$.\nBy definition of $I_Y$, $j \\notin I_Y$ if and only if $x_j \\in Y$.\nSo, we have shown that $x_j \\in \\bigcap_{i \\in I_Y} P_i^{\\mathcal{A}} \\iff x_j \\in Y$. This holds for all $j=1,2,3,4$.\nTherefore, $Y = \\bigcap_{i \\in I_Y} P_i^{\\mathcal{A}}$.\nSince we can generate any subset $Y$ of $X$ by taking an appropriate intersection of the sets $P_i^{\\mathcal{A}}$, the set $X$ of size 4 is shattered.\nThis establishes that the VC dimension is at least 4.\n\n### Step 4: Final Conclusion\n\nFrom the analysis, we have:\n- The VC dimension is at most 4.\n- The VC dimension is at least 4.\n\nTherefore, the VC dimension of $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$ is exactly 4."
