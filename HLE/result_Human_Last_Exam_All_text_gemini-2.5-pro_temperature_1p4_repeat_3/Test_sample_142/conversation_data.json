    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of Configuration State Functions (CSFs) in a full CI calculation of $\\mathrm{CH}_2 \\mathrm{SiHF}$ using a 6-31G** basis set.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Determine the composition of the molecule.**\nThe molecule is $\\mathrm{CH}_2 \\mathrm{SiHF}$.\nIt contains:\n*   1 Carbon (C) atom\n*   3 Hydrogen (H) atoms (2 from CHâ‚‚, 1 from HF part)\n*   1 Silicon (Si) atom\n*   1 Fluorine (F) atom\n\n**2. Calculate the total number of electrons ($N$).**\nThe number of electrons for each atom is its atomic number.\n*   Carbon (C): 6 electrons\n*   Hydrogen (H): 1 electron\n*   Silicon (Si): 14 electrons\n*   Fluorine (F): 9 electrons\n\nTotal number of electrons $N = (1 \\times 6) + (3 \\times 1) + (1 \\times 14) + (1 \\times 9) = 6 + 3 + 14 + 9 = 32$ electrons.\nSince the number of electrons is even, the ground state is expected to be a singlet state (total spin $S=0$).\n\n**3. Determine the number of basis functions (spatial orbitals, $K$) for the 6-31G** basis set.**\nThe 6-31G** basis set is also known as 6-31G(d,p). This means:\n*   It's a split-valence basis set.\n*   d-type polarization functions are added to all \"heavy\" (non-hydrogen) atoms.\n*   p-type polarization functions are added to all hydrogen atoms.\n*   For Pople-style basis sets, the polarization functions are typically Cartesian (6 d-functions, 3 p-functions).\n\nLet's count the basis functions for each atom:\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** The 6-31G part gives 2 s-type basis functions (1s', 1s''). The `**` (or `,p`) adds one set of p-functions (p_x, p_y, p_z), which are 3 functions.\n    *   Total for H = 2 (s) + 3 (p) = 5 basis functions.\n*   **Carbon (C) and Fluorine (F) (2nd-row atoms):** The 6-31G part consists of 1 core orbital (1s) and a split valence shell (2s', 2p' and 2s'', 2p''). This amounts to 1+1+3+1+3 = 9 basis functions. The `**` (or `,d`) adds one set of d-functions. Standard Cartesian d-functions include 6 components (d_xx, d_yy, d_zz, d_xy, d_xz, d_yz).\n    *   Total for C = 9 + 6 (d) = 15 basis functions.\n    *   Total for F = 9 + 6 (d) = 15 basis functions.\n*   **Silicon (Si) (3rd-row atom):** The 6-31G part has core orbitals (1s, 2s, 2p) and a split valence shell (3s, 3p). This amounts to 1(1s) + 1(2s) + 3(2p) + 1(3s') + 3(3p') + 1(3s'') + 3(3p'') = 13 basis functions. The `**` adds one set of 6 Cartesian d-functions.\n    *   Total for Si = 13 + 6 (d) = 19 basis functions.\n\nNow, calculate the total number of basis functions, $K$, for the entire molecule:\n$K = (\\text{funcs for C}) + (3 \\times \\text{funcs for H}) + (\\text{funcs for Si}) + (\\text{funcs for F})$\n$K = 15 + (3 \\times 5) + 19 + 15$\n$K = 15 + 15 + 19 + 15 = 64$ spatial orbitals.\n\n**4. Calculate the number of Configuration State Functions (CSFs).**\nA full CI calculation involves all possible electronic configurations. CSFs are linear combinations of Slater determinants that are eigenfunctions of the total spin operator $\\hat{S}^2$. We will calculate the number of CSFs for the singlet ground state ($S=0$).\n\nThe number of CSFs for a system with $K$ spatial orbitals, $N$ electrons, and total spin $S$ is given by the formula:\n$$ \\text{Number of CSFs} = \\binom{K}{N/2+S} \\binom{K}{N/2-S} - \\binom{K}{N/2+S+1} \\binom{K}{N/2-S-1} $$\nFor our system:\n*   $K = 64$\n*   $N = 32$\n*   $S = 0$ (for a singlet state)\n*   $N/2 = 16$\n\nPlugging these values into the formula:\n$$ \\text{Number of CSFs} = \\binom{64}{16+0} \\binom{64}{16-0} - \\binom{64}{16+0+1} \\binom{64}{16-0-1} $$\n$$ \\text{Number of CSFs} = \\binom{64}{16}^2 - \\binom{64}{17} \\binom{64}{15} $$\n\n**5. Perform the numerical calculation.**\nThis calculation requires high-precision arithmetic as the numbers are very large.\n*   $\\binom{64}{16} = \\frac{64!}{16!48!} = 2,115,075,633,000,480$\n*   $\\binom{64}{17} = \\frac{64!}{17!47!} = 5,972,001,552,001,355$\n*   $\\binom{64}{15} = \\frac{64!}{15!49!} = 690,636,941,428,728$\n\nNow, substitute these values back into the equation:\n*   Term 1: $\\binom{64}{16}^2 = (2,115,075,633,000,480)^2 = 4,473,549,206,536,066,299,106,344,960,000$\n*   Term 2: $\\binom{64}{17} \\times \\binom{64}{15} = (5,972,001,552,001,355) \\times (690,636,941,428,728) = 4,124,530,060,944,960,808,349,602,598,640$\n\nFinally, calculate the difference:\nNumber of CSFs = Term 1 - Term 2\nNumber of CSFs = $4,473,549,206,536,066,299,106,344,960,000 - 4,124,530,060,944,960,808,349,602,598,640$\nNumber of CSFs = $349,019,145,591,105,490,756,742,361,360$\n\n### Careful Points\n1.  **Electron Count:** Ensuring the sum of atomic numbers is correct for the given molecular formula.\n2.  **Basis Set Interpretation:** Correctly determining the number of basis functions for each atom is critical. This involves understanding the meaning of \"6-31G\" for different rows of the periodic table and the effect of the `**` polarization functions (d on heavy atoms, p on H). The choice of 6 Cartesian d-functions is standard but an important detail.\n3.  **CSF Formula:** Using the correct and complete formula for the number of CSFs for a specific spin state ($S=0$ in this case).\n4.  **High-Precision Calculation:** The combinatorial numbers are enormous. Standard floating-point arithmetic is insufficient and would lead to severe rounding errors and an incorrect result. The calculation must be performed using arbitrary-precision integer arithmetic.\n\nThe final answer is the result of this detailed calculation.\n\n<<<349019145591105490756742361360>>>"
