    "Answering this question involves determining the Galois group of the polynomial $f(x)$ and then applying the Chebotarev Density Theorem.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Connection to Galois Theory**\nThe natural density of the set of prime numbers $p$ for which a polynomial $f(x)$ of degree $n$ is irreducible modulo $p$ is given by the Chebotarev Density Theorem. This density is equal to the proportion of elements in the Galois group $G = \\text{Gal}(f/\\mathbb{Q})$ that act as $n$-cycles on the roots of $f(x)$. In our case, $n=7$, so we need to find the proportion of 7-cycles in $G$.\n\n**Step 2: Prove that f(x) is Irreducible over Q**\nFor the Galois group to be a transitive subgroup of $S_7$, the polynomial $f(x)$ must be irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. We can use the Eisenstein criterion on a shifted version of the polynomial.\nLet $g(x) = f(x-1) = (x-1)^7 - 14(x-1)^5 + 56(x-1)^3 - 56(x-1) + 22$.\nWe test for irreducibility using the prime $p=7$.\n1.  The leading coefficient of $g(x)$ is 1, which is not divisible by 7.\n2.  Let's find the constant term: $g(0) = f(-1) = (-1)^7 - 14(-1)^5 + 56(-1)^3 - 56(-1) + 22 = -1 + 14 - 56 + 56 + 22 = 35$. The constant term 35 is divisible by 7.\n3.  The constant term $35$ is not divisible by $7^2 = 49$.\n4.  We need to check that all other coefficients of $g(x)$ are divisible by 7. We can do this by considering $g(x)$ modulo 7.\n    $f(x) \\pmod 7 \\equiv x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22 \\equiv x^7 + 1 \\pmod 7$.\n    Therefore, $g(x) = f(x-1) \\pmod 7 \\equiv (x-1)^7 + 1 \\pmod 7$.\n    By Fermat's Little Theorem (or expanding the binomial), $(x-1)^7 \\equiv x^7 - 1 \\pmod 7$.\n    So, $g(x) \\equiv (x^7-1) + 1 \\equiv x^7 \\pmod 7$.\n    This implies that the coefficients of $x^6, x^5, \\dots, x^1$ in $g(x)$ are all divisible by 7.\n\nSince all conditions of Eisenstein's criterion for $p=7$ are met for $g(x)=f(x-1)$, $g(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. This means $f(x)$ is also irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Galois Group G**\nSince $f(x)$ is an irreducible polynomial of degree 7, its Galois group $G$ is a transitive subgroup of the symmetric group $S_7$. The possible transitive subgroups of $S_7$ are $C_7$, $D_7$, $AGL(1,7)$, $PSL(3,2)$, $A_7$, and $S_7$.\n\nTo narrow down the possibilities, we examine the factorization of $f(x)$ modulo a prime. From Step 2, we have:\n$f(x) \\equiv x^7+1 \\pmod 7$.\nThe polynomial $x^7+1$ factors over $\\mathbb{F}_7$ as:\n$x^7+1 = (x+1)(x^6 - x^5 + x^4 - x^3 + x^2 - x + 1)$.\nThe second factor is $\\Phi_{14}(x)$, the 14th cyclotomic polynomial. It is known to be irreducible over $\\mathbb{F}_7$.\nThus, the factorization of $f(x)$ modulo 7 gives one linear factor and one irreducible factor of degree 6. This means the Frobenius element at $p=7$, Frob$_7$, has a cycle structure of $(1, 6)$ (one fixed point and one 6-cycle).\n\nThe Galois group $G$ must contain an element with this cycle structure. We check which of the possible groups have such an element:\n*   $C_7$ (order 7): Contains only 7-cycles and the identity. No 6-cycles.\n*   $D_7$ (order 14): Contains 7-cycles, elements of order 2 (3 transpositions), and the identity. No 6-cycles.\n*   $PSL(3,2)$ (order 168): The possible orders of elements are 1, 2, 3, 4, 7. No elements of order 6.\n*   $A_7$: A 6-cycle is an odd permutation (product of 5 transpositions). $A_7$ only contains even permutations.\n*   $AGL(1,7)$ (order 42) and $S_7$ (order 5040) are the only possibilities left, as both contain elements with cycle structure $(1, 6)$.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Proportion of 7-Cycles in the Possible Groups**\nThe problem reduces to calculating the fraction of elements in $G$ that are 7-cycles. An element in $S_7$ is a 7-cycle if and only if its order is 7.\n\nCase 1: $G = S_7$\nThe number of 7-cycles in $S_7$ is given by the formula $\\frac{1}{7} \\binom{7}{7}(7-1)! = \\frac{7!}{7} = 6! = 720$.\nThe order of the group $S_7$ is $7! = 5040$.\nThe proportion of 7-cycles is $\\frac{720}{5040} = \\frac{1}{7}$.\n\nCase 2: $G = AGL(1,7)$\nThe group $AGL(1,7)$ is the group of affine transformations on $\\mathbb{F}_7$, of the form $x \\mapsto ax+b$, where $a \\in \\mathbb{F}_7^\\times$ and $b \\in \\mathbb{F}_7$. The order of this group is $|\\mathbb{F}_7^\\times| \\times |\\mathbb{F}_7| = 6 \\times 7 = 42$.\nA transformation $x \\mapsto ax+b$ corresponds to a 7-cycle if and only if it has no fixed points. A fixed point satisfies $x = ax+b$, or $(1-a)x = b$.\nIf $a \\neq 1$, there is a unique solution $x = b(1-a)^{-1}$, so there is a fixed point.\nIf $a=1$, the equation becomes $0=b$. If $b=0$, this is the identity map, which has 7 fixed points. If $b \\neq 0$, there is no solution, so there are no fixed points.\nThe elements that are 7-cycles are those with $a=1$ and $b \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}$. There are 6 such elements.\nThe proportion of 7-cycles is $\\frac{6}{42} = \\frac{1}{7}$.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion**\nIn both possible cases for the Galois group ($S_7$ or $AGL(1,7)$), the proportion of 7-cycles is exactly $1/7$. Therefore, we do not need to distinguish between these two groups to find the answer.\n\nThe natural density of the set of prime numbers $p$ such that $f(x)$ remains irreducible mod $p$ is $1/7$."
