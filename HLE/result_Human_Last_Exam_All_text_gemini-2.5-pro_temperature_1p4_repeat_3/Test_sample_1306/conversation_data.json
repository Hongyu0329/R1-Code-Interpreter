    "Answering this question requires analyzing the representation theory of the quantum group $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$ when $q$ is a primitive third root of unity. Let $l=3$ be the order of $q$.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the category $C$**\nThe question asks about the category $C$ of all indecomposable finite-dimensional representations of $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$. When $q$ is a root of unity, the representation theory of $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$ is much more complex than in the generic case (where $q$ is not a root of unity).\n\nThe category of finite-dimensional $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$-modules can be decomposed into blocks based on central characters. Most of these blocks are \"regular\" and semisimple, meaning every indecomposable module in them is irreducible. However, there are also \"singular\" blocks, which are not semisimple and contain indecomposable modules that are not irreducible. The most important of these is the principal block, which corresponds to representations of the \"small quantum group\" $\\mathfrak{u}_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$.\n\nFor $l=3$, the representation theory of the small quantum group $\\mathfrak{u}_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ is known to be of \"wild\" type. This implies that there is no complete classification of its indecomposable modules, and in particular, there are infinite families of non-isomorphic indecomposable modules (for example, there are one-parameter families of indecomposable modules of dimension 4). The full category $C$ also contains infinitely many simple modules (the so-called \"cyclic representations\") of dimension $l=3$.\n\n**Step 2: Addressing the \"percentage\" question**\nSince there are infinitely many irreducible objects and infinitely many reducible indecomposable objects, the question \"What percentage of the objects of C are irreducible?\" cannot be answered by a simple count of all isomorphism classes ($\\infty/\\infty$). This suggests that the question should not be interpreted literally. A common way to approach such questions in representation theory is to restrict attention to a finite, \"natural\" or \"fundamental\" set of objects that captures the essential structure of the theory.\n\n**Step 3: Identifying a natural finite set of indecomposable modules**\nThe most interesting and complex part of the representation theory is contained in the principal block, which consists of modules over the small quantum group $\\mathfrak{u}_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$. It is reasonable to assume the question implicitly refers to the fundamental building blocks of this category. In highest weight theory, the most fundamental classes of modules are:\n1.  **Simple modules ($L_c$)**: These are the irreducible \"atoms\" of the category.\n2.  **Verma modules ($M_c$)**: These are the \"standard\" modules from which others are built via resolutions.\n3.  **Projective indecomposable modules ($P_c$)**: These are the building blocks from a homological perspective.\n\nLet's count the number of non-isomorphic objects in each of these classes for $l=3$. The simple modules in the principal block are indexed by integers $c$ from $0$ to $l-2$. For $l=3$, this is $c=0,1$.\n\n1.  **Simple Modules**:\n    *   $L_0$: The trivial representation, dimension 1. It is irreducible.\n    *   $L_1$: A 2-dimensional representation. It is irreducible.\n    *   Total: 2 simple (and thus irreducible) modules.\n\n2.  **Verma Modules**:\n    *   $M_0$: The Verma module with highest weight 0. It has dimension $l=3$. Its composition factors are $L_0$ and $L_{3-2-0}=L_1$. Since it has a proper submodule, it is not irreducible.\n    *   $M_1$: The Verma module with highest weight 1. It has dimension $l=3$. Its composition factors are $L_1$ and $L_{3-2-1}=L_0$. It is not irreducible.\n    *   Total: 2 Verma modules, both of which are reducible.\n\n3.  **Projective Indecomposable Modules**:\n    *   $P_0$: The projective cover of $L_0$. It has dimension $2l=6$. It is not irreducible.\n    *   $P_1$: The projective cover of $L_1$. It has dimension $2l=6$. It is not irreducible.\n    *   Total: 2 projective modules, both of which are reducible.\n\nThese three families of modules are disjoint. A simple module cannot be a Verma or projective module based on dimension ($\\dim L_c \\leq l-1$, $\\dim M_c = l$, $\\dim P_c = 2l$). A Verma module cannot be projective based on dimension.\n\n**Step 4: Calculating the percentage**\nOur natural, finite set of fundamental indecomposable objects is $C' = \\{L_0, L_1, M_0, M_1, P_0, P_1\\}$.\n*   The total number of objects in this set is $2+2+2 = 6$.\n*   The number of irreducible objects in this set is the number of simple modules, which is 2.\n\nThe percentage of irreducible objects in this natural set is:\n$$ \\text{Percentage} = \\frac{\\text{Number of irreducible objects}}{\\text{Total number of objects}} = \\frac{2}{6} = \\frac{1}{3} $$\nThis result is stable for any $l \\geq 3$. The number of objects in each of the three families is $l-1$, so the total number of objects in the set would be $3(l-1)$, and the number of irreducibles is $l-1$, yielding a percentage of $\\frac{l-1}{3(l-1)} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nConverting the fraction to a percentage: $\\frac{1}{3} \\times 100\\% = 33.33...\\%$.\n\nFinal Answer is 1/3.\n\n>>>1/3"
