    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understanding the Phenomenon: Spontaneous Parametric Downconversion (SPDC)**\n    *   SPDC is a quantum optical and nonlinear optical process.\n    *   In SPDC, a high-energy photon (from a \"pump\" light source) passes through a suitable nonlinear optical material and spontaneously splits into a pair of lower-energy photons (conventionally called the \"signal\" and \"idler\").\n    *   This process must conserve energy (frequency of the pump photon equals the sum of the frequencies of the signal and idler photons) and momentum (phase-matching condition).\n    *   From a materials science perspective, SPDC is a second-order nonlinear optical effect.\n\n2.  **Identifying the Material Requirement for SPDC**\n    *   Second-order nonlinear optical effects, including SPDC, are described by the second-order nonlinear susceptibility tensor, denoted as χ⁽²⁾.\n    *   For a material to exhibit any second-order effect, its bulk χ⁽²⁾ must be non-zero.\n    *   There is a fundamental symmetry rule in physics: In materials that possess a center of inversion (i.e., they are **centrosymmetric**), the bulk χ⁽²⁾ is necessarily zero.\n    *   Therefore, the crucial question becomes: **Does the crystal structure of free-standing boron nanosheets possess inversion symmetry?**\n\n3.  **Analyzing the Structure of Boron Nanosheets (Borophene)**\n    *   Boron nanosheets, or borophene, is a two-dimensional (2D) allotrope of boron.\n    *   Unlike graphene, which has a single stable honeycomb structure, borophene exhibits **polymorphism**, meaning it can exist in multiple stable or metastable crystal structures (phases).\n    *   The most commonly studied and experimentally synthesized phases are typically grown on a substrate (like silver, Ag(111)). The question specifies \"free-standing,\" so we consider the intrinsic structure of the nanosheet itself.\n    *   Common phases include the planar β₁₂ and χ₃ sheets, as well as corrugated \"striped\" phases.\n\n4.  **Checking the Symmetry of Borophene Phases**\n    *   We must examine the crystal symmetry of these common borophene phases to see if they are centrosymmetric.\n    *   **β₁₂ and χ₃ phases:** These are planar phases based on a triangular lattice with specific arrangements of atomic vacancies. Both of these structures are known to be **centrosymmetric**. For every atom at a position (**x**, **y**), there is an identical atom at (-**x**, -**y**) relative to an inversion center in the unit cell.\n    *   **Striped phases:** More recent research has identified puckered or corrugated phases of borophene. For instance, the synthesized 8-Pmmn borophene structure is also **centrosymmetric**. The *Pmmn* space group belongs to a crystal class (D₂h) that contains an inversion center.\n    *   Because the known stable and low-energy structures of borophene all possess inversion symmetry, their crystal lattice is centrosymmetric.\n\n5.  **Conclusion Based on Symmetry**\n    *   Since the common forms of boron nanosheets are centrosymmetric, their bulk second-order nonlinear susceptibility (χ⁽²⁾) is zero.\n    *   A material with a zero bulk χ⁽²⁾ cannot support bulk second-order nonlinear optical processes.\n    *   Therefore, free-standing boron nanosheets would not be expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric downconversion.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Bulk vs. Edge Effects:** While the bulk 2D crystal lattice of borophene is centrosymmetric, the inversion symmetry is inherently broken at the edges of the nanosheet. This could, in principle, lead to a very weak SPDC signal originating from the edges, but this is not an intrinsic property of the material itself and would be extremely inefficient compared to materials with a non-zero bulk χ⁽²⁾.\n*   **Strain and Defects:** Significant strain or specific types of defects could locally break the inversion symmetry, but this would not be a property of the ideal, defect-free crystal.\n*   **Comparison to Other 2D Materials:** This conclusion is consistent with other elemental 2D materials like graphene, which is also centrosymmetric and has a zero bulk χ⁽²⁾. In contrast, 2D materials like monolayer molybdenum disulfide (MoS₂) or hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) lack inversion symmetry and are well-known for their strong second-order nonlinear optical responses, making them candidates for SPDC. Borophene's structure falls into the former category.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the analysis, since the stable phases of boron nanosheets possess inversion symmetry, their bulk second-order nonlinear susceptibility (χ⁽²⁾) is zero. A non-zero χ⁽²⁾ is a prerequisite for spontaneous parametric downconversion. Therefore, free-standing boron nanosheets would not be expected to exhibit this phenomenon.\n\n<<<No, because the common, stable crystal structures of boron nanosheets are centrosymmetric, resulting in a zero bulk second-order nonlinear susceptibility (χ⁽²⁾), which is a necessary condition for spontaneous parametric downconversion.>>>"
