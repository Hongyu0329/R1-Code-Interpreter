    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the equilibrium values of entropy and mean energy for the Bose case of light quanta using the principles of the Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramér-Chernoff large deviation theorems.\n\n### **Conceptual Framework**\n\nThe problem asks us to find the equilibrium properties of a photon gas. In statistical mechanics, equilibrium is the most probable macroscopic state. Large Deviation Theory (LDT) provides a mathematical framework for calculating the probabilities of rare events, and thus for identifying the most probable state.\n\n1.  **Cramér-Chernoff Theorem:** This theorem describes the probability of the sample mean of i.i.d. random variables deviating from the true mean. In statistical mechanics, this principle is generalized by the Gärtner-Ellis theorem and applies to macroscopic observables like total energy. It states that the probability of observing a macroscopic value (e.g., energy density $u$) that is different from the equilibrium value $u_{eq}$ is exponentially small. The equilibrium value is the one that minimizes the corresponding rate function, and this value turns out to be the expectation value derived from the partition function. We will use this to find the mean energy.\n\n2.  **Boltzmann-Sanov Theorem:** This theorem describes the probability of observing a certain empirical distribution from a series of i.i.d. trials. The probability of seeing an empirical distribution $Q$ when the true underlying distribution is $P$ is exponentially small in the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence $D_{KL}(Q||P)$. To find the most likely (equilibrium) distribution subject to certain constraints, we must minimize this KL divergence. This is the information-theoretic basis for the Principle of Maximum Entropy. We will use this to find the equilibrium entropy.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**Part 1: Finding the Equilibrium Mean Energy using Cramér-Chernoff Logic**\n\n1.  **System Model:** A photon gas is equivalent to a collection of independent quantum harmonic oscillators, called modes, indexed by $i$ (representing, for example, different frequencies and wavevectors). Each mode $i$ has discrete energy levels $n_i \\epsilon_i$ where $n_i=0, 1, 2, ...$ is the number of photons (quanta) in that mode.\n\n2.  **Partition Function:** The total energy of the system $E = \\sum_i n_i \\epsilon_i$ is a random variable. The thermodynamic properties can be derived from the appropriate partition function. For photons, the number of particles is not conserved, so their chemical potential is zero ($\\mu=0$). The relevant partition function is the Grand Canonical Partition Function ($\\mathcal{Z}$):\n    $\\mathcal{Z} = \\prod_i \\sum_{n_i=0}^{\\infty} e^{-\\beta (n_i \\epsilon_i - \\mu n_i)}$\n    With $\\mu=0$:\n    $\\mathcal{Z} = \\prod_i \\sum_{n_i=0}^{\\infty} (e^{-\\beta \\epsilon_i})^{n_i}$\n    Each sum is a geometric series, yielding:\n    $\\mathcal{Z} = \\prod_i \\frac{1}{1 - e^{-\\beta \\epsilon_i}}$\n    The logarithm of the partition function is $\\log\\mathcal{Z} = -\\sum_i \\log(1 - e^{-\\beta\\epsilon_i})$.\n\n3.  **Applying Cramér-Chernoff/Gärtner-Ellis:** According to LDT, the partition function acts as a moment-generating function for the energy. The equilibrium value of the energy, $U$, is the expectation value $\\langle E \\rangle$. This is the value that minimizes the rate function for energy fluctuations. This equilibrium energy $U$ is found by differentiating $\\log\\mathcal{Z}$ with respect to $\\beta$ (the inverse temperature).\n    $U = \\langle E \\rangle = -\\frac{\\partial (\\log\\mathcal{Z})}{\\partial \\beta}$\n    $U = -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\beta} \\left(-\\sum_i \\log(1 - e^{-\\beta\\epsilon_i})\\right)$\n    $U = \\sum_i \\frac{1}{1-e^{-\\beta\\epsilon_i}} \\cdot (-e^{-\\beta\\epsilon_i}) \\cdot (-\\epsilon_i)$\n    $U = \\sum_i \\frac{\\epsilon_i e^{-\\beta\\epsilon_i}}{1 - e^{-\\beta\\epsilon_i}}$\n\n4.  **Equilibrium Mean Energy:**\n    The equilibrium mean energy $U$ is given by the formula:\n    $U = \\sum_i \\frac{\\epsilon_i}{e^{\\beta\\epsilon_i} - 1}$\n    This is the sum of the average energies in each mode, and is the basis for Planck's law of black-body radiation. The average number of photons in mode $i$ is $\\langle n_i \\rangle = \\frac{U_i}{\\epsilon_i} = \\frac{1}{e^{\\beta\\epsilon_i}-1}$.\n\n**Part 2: Finding the Equilibrium Entropy using Boltzmann-Sanov Logic**\n\n1.  **Applying the Principle:** For bosons, particles are not independent, so we cannot apply Sanov's theorem to a sample of particles. Instead, we apply its underlying logic (Principle of Maximum Entropy) to determine the probability distribution of the occupation number $n$ for a *single mode* $i$. The equilibrium distribution is the most probable one, i.e., the one with the maximum entropy, given the physical constraints.\n\n2.  **Maximizing Entropy for a Single Mode:** For a given mode $i$, let $p(n)$ be the probability that it contains $n$ photons. We want to find the distribution $p(n)$ that maximizes the Shannon entropy $S_i = -k_B \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty p(n) \\log p(n)$ subject to the constraints:\n    *   Normalization: $\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty p(n) = 1$\n    *   Fixed Mean Occupation: $\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty n \\cdot p(n) = \\langle n_i \\rangle$ (where $\\langle n_i \\rangle$ is the mean number of photons in that mode, determined by the system's temperature).\n\n3.  **Result of Maximization:** This is a standard optimization problem whose solution is the geometric distribution: $p(n) \\propto e^{-\\lambda n}$. After normalization, the entropy of this distribution can be calculated in terms of the mean $\\langle n_i \\rangle$.\n\n4.  **Equilibrium Entropy:** The entropy for a single bosonic mode, derived from this principle, is (setting Boltzmann constant $k_B=1$ for simplicity):\n    $S_i = (\\langle n_i \\rangle + 1)\\log(\\langle n_i \\rangle + 1) - \\langle n_i \\rangle \\log(\\langle n_i \\rangle)$\n    Since the modes are independent, the total entropy $S$ of the system is the sum of the entropies of all modes.\n    $S = \\sum_i S_i = \\sum_i \\left[ (\\langle n_i \\rangle + 1)\\log(\\langle n_i \\rangle + 1) - \\langle n_i \\rangle \\log(\\langle n_i \\rangle) \\right]$\n    Here, $\\langle n_i \\rangle$ is the equilibrium mean occupation number we found in Part 1: $\\langle n_i \\rangle = \\frac{1}{e^{\\beta\\epsilon_i} - 1}$.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nThe equilibrium values are functions of the inverse temperature $\\beta$ and the energy level structure $\\{\\epsilon_i\\}$.\n\n*   **Equilibrium Mean Energy (U):**\n    $U = \\sum_i \\frac{\\epsilon_i}{e^{\\beta\\epsilon_i} - 1}$\n\n*   **Equilibrium Entropy (S):**\n    $S = \\sum_i \\left[ (\\langle n_i \\rangle + 1)\\log(\\langle n_i \\rangle + 1) - \\langle n_i \\rangle \\log(\\langle n_i \\rangle) \\right]$, where the mean occupation number for each state is given by $\\langle n_i \\rangle = \\frac{1}{e^{\\beta\\epsilon_i} - 1}$.\n\n<<<\nEquilibrium Mean Energy: $U = \\sum_i \\frac{\\epsilon_i}{e^{\\beta\\epsilon_i} - 1}$\n\nEquilibrium Entropy: $S = k_B \\sum_i \\left[ \\left(\\frac{1}{e^{\\beta\\epsilon_i} - 1} + 1\\right)\\log\\left(\\frac{1}{e^{\\beta\\epsilon_i} - 1} + 1\\right) - \\left(\\frac{1}{e^{\\beta\\epsilon_i} - 1}\\right)\\log\\left(\\frac{1}{e^{\\beta\\epsilon_i} - 1}\\right) \\right]$\nThis can also be written in terms of the average occupation numbers $\\langle n_i \\rangle = \\frac{1}{e^{\\beta\\epsilon_i}-1}$ as:\n$S = k_B \\sum_i \\left[ (\\langle n_i \\rangle + 1)\\log(\\langle n_i \\rangle + 1) - \\langle n_i \\rangle \\log(\\langle n_i \\rangle) \\right]$\n(where $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant).\n>>>"
