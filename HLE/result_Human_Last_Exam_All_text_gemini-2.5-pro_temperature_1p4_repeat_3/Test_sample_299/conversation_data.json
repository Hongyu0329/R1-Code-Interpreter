    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the cardinality of the set of continuous functions $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ that satisfy the equation $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the properties of the function `f`**\n\nLet $g(x) = \\exp(x) = e^x$. The equation is $f(f(x)) = g(x)$.\n\n1.  **Injectivity of `f`**:\n    Suppose $f(x_1) = f(x_2)$ for some $x_1, x_2 \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Applying $f$ to both sides, we get $f(f(x_1)) = f(f(x_2))$. This means $e^{x_1} = e^{x_2}$. Since the exponential function is injective, we must have $x_1 = x_2$. Therefore, $f$ is an injective function.\n\n2.  **Monotonicity of `f`**:\n    A continuous and injective function on $\\mathbb{R}$ must be strictly monotonic. Thus, $f$ is either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing.\n\n3.  **Check the monotonicity case**:\n    *   If $f$ is strictly increasing, then the composition $f \\circ f$ is also strictly increasing. Since $g(x) = e^x$ is strictly increasing, this case is possible.\n    *   If $f$ is strictly decreasing, then the composition $f \\circ f$ is strictly increasing (the composition of two decreasing functions is increasing). This case is also seemingly possible.\n\n4.  **Existence of fixed points**:\n    A fixed point of $f$ is a value $x_0$ such that $f(x_0) = x_0$. If $f$ had a fixed point $x_0$, then $f(f(x_0)) = f(x_0) = x_0$. This would imply $e^{x_0} = x_0$. However, the equation $e^x = x$ has no real solutions (the function $h(x) = e^x - x$ has a minimum value of $1$ at $x=0$, so $e^x > x$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$). Therefore, $f$ has no fixed points.\n\n**Step 2: Rule out the decreasing case**\n\nLet's assume $f$ is strictly decreasing.\nConsider the function $h(x) = f(x) - x$. Since $f$ and $x$ are continuous, $h(x)$ is continuous on $\\mathbb{R}$.\nSince $f$ is strictly decreasing, $\\lim_{x \\to +\\infty} f(x) = L$ (where $L$ can be a finite number or $-\\infty$) and $\\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} f(x) = M$ (where $M$ can be a finite number or $+\\infty$), with $M > L$.\nLet's analyze the limits of $h(x)$:\n*   $\\lim_{x \\to +\\infty} h(x) = \\lim_{x \\to +\\infty} (f(x) - x) = L - \\infty = -\\infty$.\n*   $\\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} h(x) = \\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} (f(x) - x) = M - (-\\infty) = +\\infty$.\nSince $h(x)$ is a continuous function that goes from $+\\infty$ to $-\\infty$, by the Intermediate Value Theorem, there must exist some $x_0 \\in \\mathbb{R}$ such that $h(x_0) = 0$. This means $f(x_0) - x_0 = 0$, or $f(x_0) = x_0$.\nThis contradicts the fact that $f$ has no fixed points. Therefore, **`f` cannot be strictly decreasing.**\n\n**Step 3: Establish properties of increasing solutions**\n\nWe are left with the conclusion that any solution `f` must be strictly increasing.\nSince $f$ is continuous, strictly increasing, and has no fixed points, its graph must lie entirely above or entirely below the line $y=x$.\n*   Case A: $f(x) < x$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Since $f$ is increasing, applying $f$ to both sides gives $f(f(x)) < f(x)$. Combining the inequalities, we get $f(f(x)) < f(x) < x$. This implies $e^x < x$, which contradicts the known fact that $e^x > x$ for all real $x$.\n*   Case B: $f(x) > x$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. This is consistent with $f(f(x)) = e^x$, since $e^x > x$.\n\nSo, any solution `f` must be **strictly increasing** and satisfy **`f(x) > x`** for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\n**Step 4: Constructing the solutions and finding the cardinality**\n\nThe solutions can be partitioned into two disjoint types based on the range of $f$. Since $f$ is a continuous and strictly increasing function on $\\mathbb{R}$, its range, $R(f)$, must be an open interval. Let $\\lim_{x\\to-\\infty} f(x) = L$.\n\n**Type 1: `f` is a homeomorphism of `R`**\nThis occurs if the range of $f$ is $\\mathbb{R}$, which means $L = -\\infty$. In this case, $f$ is a bijection from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$. Such functions are called homeomorphisms.\nFor this class of functions, the problem of finding $f$ such that $f(f(x))=e^x$ can be solved using topological conjugacy. Any strictly increasing homeomorphism $f:\\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ with no fixed points is conjugate to a translation, i.e., $f(x) = \\phi^{-1}(\\phi(x)+c)$ for some homeomorphism $\\phi$ and constant $c$. Let's choose $c=1$.\nThen $f(f(x)) = \\phi^{-1}(\\phi(x)+2)$. We require this to be $e^x$.\nSo, $e^x = \\phi^{-1}(\\phi(x)+2)$, which is equivalent to the functional equation $\\phi(e^x) = \\phi(x)+2$.\nTo construct such a function $\\phi$, we can define it on a fundamental domain of the dynamical system $x \\mapsto e^x$. For instance, the interval $[1, e]$. We are free to choose $\\phi$ to be any strictly increasing continuous function on $[1,e]$ satisfying $\\phi(e) = \\phi(1)+2$. Let's fix $\\phi(1)=0$, which implies $\\phi(e)=2$. The number of strictly increasing continuous functions from $[1, e]$ to $[0, 2]$ is the cardinality of the continuum, $\\mathfrak{c} = 2^{\\aleph_0}$.\nEach such choice on $[1, e]$ can be uniquely extended to a continuous, strictly increasing function $\\phi$ on all of $\\mathbb{R}$ that solves the functional equation. Each distinct choice of $\\phi$ on $[1,e]$ will produce a distinct function $f$. Thus, there are $\\mathfrak{c}$ solutions of this type.\n\n**Type 2: `f` has a finite lower bound on its range**\nThis occurs if $L = \\lim_{x\\to-\\infty} f(x)$ is a finite value. The range of $f$ is then $(L, \\infty)$.\nSince $f$ is continuous on $\\mathbb{R}$, we can evaluate the limit:\n$\\lim_{x\\to-\\infty} f(f(x)) = \\lim_{y \\to L^+} f(y) = f(L)$.\nWe also know that $\\lim_{x\\to-\\infty} e^x = 0$.\nSo, we must have $f(L) = 0$.\nFrom $f(x)>x$, we have $f(L)>L$, which means $0>L$. This is consistent.\nNow we can construct solutions of this type. A solution is characterized by this value $L<0$. For each choice of $L \\in (-\\infty, 0)$, we can construct a family of solutions.\nThe construction proceeds by defining $f$ on the interval $[L, 0]$. Let $h(x) = f(x)$ for $x \\in [L, 0]$. Since $f$ is strictly increasing, $h$ must be a strictly increasing continuous function from $[L, 0]$ to $[f(L), f(0)]$. We know $f(L)=0$ and $f(f(L))=e^L \\implies f(0)=e^L$. So $h: [L,0] \\to [0, e^L]$.\nThis initial piece $h$ must satisfy the condition $f(x)>x$. Furthermore, for the function to be a valid solution when extended to all of $\\mathbb{R}$, $h$ must satisfy $x < h(x) < e^x$ for $x \\in (L,0)$.\nFor any $L<0$, we can choose such a function $h$. In fact, the set of such functions $h$ has cardinality $\\mathfrak{c}$. For example, we can choose a point $x_0 \\in (L,0)$ and map it to any $y_0$ in an open interval determined by the constraints, then build a piecewise linear function. The number of choices for $y_0$ is uncountably infinite.\nSince we have a continuum of choices for $L \\in (-\\infty, 0)$, and for each $L$ we have a continuum of choices for the function $h$, the total number of solutions of this type is $\\mathfrak{c} \\times \\mathfrak{c} = \\mathfrak{c}$.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion**\n\nThe set of all such continuous functions $f$ is the disjoint union of the set of Type 1 solutions ($S_1$) and the set of Type 2 solutions ($S_2$).\nThe cardinality of the total set is $|S_1| + |S_2| = \\mathfrak{c} + \\mathfrak{c} = \\mathfrak{c}$.\nThe cardinality of the continuum is denoted by $\\mathfrak{c}$ or $2^{\\aleph_0}$.\n\nThe final answer is the cardinality of the continuum."
