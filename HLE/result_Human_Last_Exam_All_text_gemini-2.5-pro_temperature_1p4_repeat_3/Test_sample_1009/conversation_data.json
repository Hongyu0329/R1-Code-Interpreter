    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the largest possible weight of the group $G$.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the properties of the group G**\n\nWe are given a topological group $G$ with the following properties:\n1.  **Compact**: Every open cover of $G$ has a finite subcover.\n2.  **First-countable**: Every point has a countable local base. For a topological group, this is equivalent to the identity element $e$ having a countable local base. The character of the group is $\\chi(G) = \\aleph_0$.\n3.  **Cardinality**: $|G| = 2^{2^\\frak c}$, where $\\frak c = 2^{\\aleph_0}$ is the cardinality of the continuum.\n4.  **Possibly non-Hausdorff**: The space is not assumed to be $T_2$, which for a topological group means it might also fail to be $T_1$ or $T_0$.\n\nWe want to find the maximum possible value for the weight of $G$, denoted by $w(G)$. The weight is the minimum cardinality of a base for the topology of $G$.\n\n**Step 2: Establish an upper bound for the weight of G**\n\nWe will use two fundamental inequalities from general topology and topological group theory.\n\n1.  **Relating weight and density in first-countable groups:**\n    For any topological group $G$, the weight $w(G)$ and the density $d(G)$ (the minimum cardinality of a dense subset) and the character $\\chi(G)$ are related by the inequality $w(G) \\le d(G) \\cdot \\chi(G)$.\n    Since $G$ is first-countable, we have $\\chi(G) = \\aleph_0$. So, $w(G) \\le d(G) \\cdot \\aleph_0$.\n    For any topological space, we also have $d(G) \\le w(G)$.\n    The cardinality of $G$ is $2^{2^\\frak c}$, which is an uncountable cardinal, so $G$ cannot have a finite dense set, which means $d(G)$ must be infinite.\n    If $d(G)$ is an infinite cardinal, then $d(G) \\cdot \\aleph_0 = \\max(d(G), \\aleph_0)$.\n    If $d(G) \\ge \\aleph_0$, we have $w(G) \\le d(G)$. Combined with $d(G) \\le w(G)$, this implies $w(G) = d(G)$ for any first-countable group with infinite weight.\n\n2.  **Bounding the density of a compact space:**\n    A major result in topology, due to Hajnal and Juhasz, states that for any compact topological space $X$, its density is bounded by its character: $d(X) \\le 2^{\\chi(X)}$. (This is derived from $d(X) \\le 2^{s(X)}$ and $s(X) \\le \\chi(X)$ where $s(X)$ is the spread of $X$. This result does not require the space to be Hausdorff).\n    Since our group $G$ is compact and first-countable ($\\chi(G) = \\aleph_0$), we can apply this theorem.\n    $d(G) \\le 2^{\\chi(G)} = 2^{\\aleph_0} = \\frak c$.\n\n3.  **Combining the results:**\n    From step 2.1, we have $w(G) = d(G)$ (since $|G|$ being huge implies $w(G)$ is infinite).\n    From step 2.2, we have $d(G) \\le \\frak c$.\n    Therefore, we can conclude that $w(G) \\le \\frak c$.\n    This shows that the weight of any such group $G$ cannot exceed $\\frak c$.\n\n**Step 3: Show that this upper bound can be attained**\n\nNow we need to show that it is possible to construct a group $G$ satisfying all the given conditions and having a weight of exactly $\\frak c$.\n\n1.  **The construction strategy:**\n    We will build $G$ as a product of two groups, $G = H_0 \\times G_0$. The non-Hausdorff property is key. In a topological group $G$, the closure of the identity, $H = \\overline{\\{e\\}}$, is a closed normal subgroup. The quotient group $G/H$ is a compact Hausdorff group. The idea is to let one part of the construction ($H_0$) be a \"large\" group that accounts for the huge cardinality and the non-Hausdorff nature, and the other part ($G_0$) be a \"well-behaved\" Hausdorff group that determines the weight.\n\n2.  **Constructing the components:**\n    *   Let $G_0$ be a compact, first-countable, Hausdorff topological group with weight $w(G_0) = \\frak c$. The existence of such a group is known to be consistent with the standard axioms of set theory (ZFC). For instance, under the Continuum Hypothesis (CH), such groups can be explicitly constructed. Since the question asks for the \"largest possible\" weight, we are allowed to assume a model of ZFC where such an object exists.\n        *   For such a group $G_0$, we know its cardinality must satisfy $|G_0| \\le 2^{\\chi(G_0)} = 2^{\\aleph_0} = \\frak c$. Also, since $w(G_0) = \\frak c$ and $d(G_0) \\le |G_0|$, its density $d(G_0)$ must be $\\frak c$. As $d(G_0) \\le |G_0|$, we must have $|G_0| = \\frak c$.\n    *   Let $H_0$ be an abstract group of cardinality $2^{2^\\frak c}$. We equip $H_0$ with the **indiscrete topology** (where the only open sets are $\\emptyset$ and $H_0$).\n        *   With this topology, $H_0$ is a compact topological group. It is trivially first-countable (a local base at the identity is $\\{H_0, H_0, \\dots\\}$).\n\n3.  **Constructing the final group G:**\n    Let $G = H_0 \\times G_0$. The topology on $G$ is the product topology. Since $H_0$ has the indiscrete topology, a base for the topology on $G$ is given by sets of the form $\\{H_0 \\times B\\}$, where $B$ is a member of a base for $G_0$.\n\n4.  **Verifying the properties of G:**\n    *   **Topological Group**: The product of two topological groups is a topological group.\n    *   **Compact**: $G$ is the product of two compact spaces ($H_0$ is compact, $G_0$ is compact), so by Tychonoff's theorem, $G$ is compact.\n    *   **First-countable**: The identity of $G$ is $(e_H, e_G)$. A local base for $e_G$ in $G_0$ is countable, say $\\{V_n\\}$. Then $\\{H_0 \\times V_n\\}$ forms a countable local base for the identity of $G$. So, $G$ is first-countable.\n    *   **Cardinality**: $|G| = |H_0| \\cdot |G_0| = 2^{2^\\frak c} \\cdot \\frak c = 2^{2^\\frak c}$. This matches the requirement.\n    *   **Non-Hausdorff**: The identity in $G$ is $e_G = (e_H, e_{G_0})$. The closure of the identity singleton is $\\overline{\\{e_G\\}} = H_0 \\times \\{e_{G_0}\\}$, because $G_0$ is Hausdorff ($\\overline{\\{e_{G_0}\\}} = \\{e_{G_0}\\}$), while any open neighborhood of a point in $H_0$ is $H_0$ itself. Since $|H_0| > 1$, $\\overline{\\{e_G\\}}$ is not a singleton, so $G$ is not Hausdorff.\n    *   **Weight**: The base for $G$ is $\\{H_0 \\times B_\\alpha\\}$ where $\\{B_\\alpha\\}$ is a base for $G_0$. The cardinality of this base is exactly the cardinality of the base for $G_0$. Thus, $w(G) = w(G_0) = \\frak c$.\n\n**Step 4: Conclusion**\n\nWe have shown that for any group $G$ with the given properties, its weight $w(G)$ must be less than or equal to $\\frak c$. We have also shown that, assuming set-theoretic consistency, a group $G$ with these properties and weight exactly $\\frak c$ can be constructed. Therefore, the largest possible weight of the group is $\\frak c$."
