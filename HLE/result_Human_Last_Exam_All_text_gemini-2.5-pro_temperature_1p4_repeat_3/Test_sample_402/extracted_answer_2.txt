The proposed filtering strategy involves a multi-step process. First, an independent reference list of cancer-specific marker genes must be compiled, ideally from RNA-seq data of the cancer cell line in monoculture. Second, a standard differential expression analysis is performed comparing the CAR-IL15 group to the CAR-only group. The core of the filtering strategy is a two-tiered approach for identifying a gene as a contaminant: 1) The gene must exhibit strong statistical evidence of contamination in the experiment, defined by a highly negative log2 Fold Change (e.g., < -3) and a significant adjusted p-value (e.g., < 0.01). 2) The gene must also be present on the independently generated reference list of cancer-specific markers. A gene is only removed from the final analysis dataset if it meets both criteria. This process can be implemented in a command-line pipeline by first using tools like 'awk' to select genes meeting the statistical thresholds, then using 'grep' to find the intersection of that list with the cancer marker list, and finally using 'grep' again to exclude this final set of confirmed contaminant genes from the main results file.
