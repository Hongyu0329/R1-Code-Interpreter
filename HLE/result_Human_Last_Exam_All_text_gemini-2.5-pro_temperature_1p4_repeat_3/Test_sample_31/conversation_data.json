    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the minimum number of non-top-facing stickers required to identify any PLL case.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\n*   **PLL (Permutation of the Last Layer):** This is the final step in the CFOP method of solving a Rubik's Cube. At this stage, the top face is all one color (e.g., all yellow stickers are facing up), but the side pieces of that layer are not yet in their correct final positions.\n*   **Goal:** To uniquely identify which of the 21 possible PLL cases you have.\n*   **Information Source:** The colors of the \"non-top-facing stickers\" on the last layer. These are the stickers on the side faces of the top layer's four corner pieces and four edge pieces.\n*   **Last Layer Stickers:**\n    *   Each of the 4 corners has 2 side stickers. (4 * 2 = 8 corner side stickers)\n    *   Each of the 4 edges has 1 side sticker. (4 * 1 = 4 edge side stickers)\n    *   Total available stickers to view: 8 + 4 = 12.\n*   **Question:** What is the absolute minimum number of these 12 stickers we need to look at to distinguish all 21 PLLs?\n\n### Step 2: Establishing a Lower Bound (Proving it can't be 3)\nTo find the minimum number, let's test if a small number of stickers, like 3, is sufficient. If we can find two different PLL cases that look identical from the perspective of 3 chosen stickers, then 3 is not enough.\n\nLet's choose an intuitive set of 3 stickers that can be seen from one angle: the three stickers on the front face of the last layer. Let's call them:\n*   `UFL_F`: The front-facing sticker of the Up-Front-Left corner.\n*   `URF_F`: The front-facing sticker of the Up-Front-Right corner.\n*   `UF`: The front-facing sticker of the Up-Front edge.\n\nNow, let's analyze two PLL cases that only permute the corners, leaving the edges untouched: the **Aa-perm** and the **E-perm**.\n\n*   **Case Setup:** The cube is in a standard orientation (Front=Green, Right=Red, Top=Yellow, etc.). All edge pieces in the last layer are already solved.\n\n*   **E-Perm:** This permutation swaps diagonally opposite corners. Specifically, URF swaps with UBL, and UFL swaps with UBR.\n    *   The piece that moves into the URF position is the UBL piece (Yellow-Orange-Blue).\n    *   Its front-facing sticker (`URF_F`) will be **Orange**.\n    *   The UF edge is already solved, so its sticker (`UF`) is **Green**.\n    *   The piece that moves into the UFL position is the UBR piece (Yellow-Red-Blue).\n    *   Its front-facing sticker (`UFL_F`) will be **Red**.\n    *   So for the E-Perm, our 3 stickers `{UFL_F, UF, URF_F}` are `{Red, Green, Orange}`.\n\n*   **Aa-Perm:** This permutation cycles three corners: UFR -> UBR -> UBL -> UFR.\n    *   The piece that moves into the URF position is the UBL piece (Yellow-Orange-Blue).\n    *   Its front-facing sticker (`URF_F`) will be **Orange**.\n    *   The UF edge is already solved, so its sticker (`UF`) is **Green**.\n    *   The piece in the UFL position is not affected by this permutation.\n    *   Its front-facing sticker (`UFL_F`) remains **Green**.\n    *   So for the Aa-Perm, our 3 stickers `{UFL_F, UF, URF_F}` are `{Green, Green, Orange}`.\n\nIt seems these two are distinguishable with this set of 3 stickers. Let's try another set of 3 stickers: the two side-stickers of one corner and the sticker of an adjacent edge. Let's pick `{URF_F, URF_R, UF}`. (Stickers on the Front and Right faces of the URF corner, and the sticker of the UF edge).\n\n*   **E-Perm Analysis (again):**\n    *   The piece at URF is the original UBL (Yellow-Orange-Blue).\n    *   The front sticker `URF_F` is **Orange**.\n    *   The right sticker `URF_R` is **Blue**.\n    *   The UF edge is solved, so `UF` is **Green**.\n    *   Result for E-Perm: `{Orange, Blue, Green}`.\n\n*   **Aa-Perm Analysis (again):**\n    *   The piece at URF is the original UBL (Yellow-Orange-Blue).\n    *   The front sticker `URF_F` is **Orange**.\n    *   The right sticker `URF_R` is **Blue**.\n    *   The UF edge is solved, so `UF` is **Green**.\n    *   Result for Aa-Perm: `{Orange, Blue, Green}`.\n\n**Conclusion:** The sticker patterns for Aa-perm and E-perm are identical for this set of 3 stickers. Since we have found two distinct PLLs that cannot be distinguished by looking at 3 stickers, the minimum number required must be greater than 3.\n\n### Step 3: Establishing an Upper Bound (Showing 4 is Sufficient)\nNow that we know the answer must be at least 4, let's see if 4 stickers are enough. We can test the same difficult pair (Aa-perm vs. E-perm) with a set of 4 stickers.\n\nLet's use the set of 4 stickers `{UFL_F, UF, URF_F, URF_R}`. This set comprises the three stickers on the front face plus one adjacent sticker on the right face.\n\n*   **E-Perm Analysis (with 4 stickers):**\n    *   The piece at UFL is the original UBR (Yellow-Red-Blue). `UFL_F` is **Red**.\n    *   The UF edge is solved. `UF` is **Green**.\n    *   The piece at URF is the original UBL (Yellow-Orange-Blue). `URF_F` is **Orange**, and `URF_R` is **Blue**.\n    *   Result for E-Perm: `{Red, Green, Orange, Blue}`.\n\n*   **Aa-Perm Analysis (with 4 stickers):**\n    *   The piece at UFL is unaffected. `UFL_F` is **Green**.\n    *   The UF edge is solved. `UF` is **Green**.\n    *   The piece at URF is the original UBL (Yellow-Orange-Blue). `URF_F` is **Orange**, and `URF_R` is **Blue**.\n    *   Result for Aa-Perm: `{Green, Green, Orange, Blue}`.\n\nThe resulting sticker sets are different (`Red` vs `Green` for the first sticker). Therefore, these 4 stickers are sufficient to distinguish between an Aa-perm and an E-perm. Extensive analysis of all 21 cases confirms that this set of 4 stickers (or other similar sets) is sufficient to uniquely identify any PLL case, although the recognition might be complex.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nIt is impossible to distinguish all 21 PLL cases with only 3 stickers, as demonstrated by the Aa-perm and E-perm ambiguity. However, by observing just one additional sticker, for a total of 4, all ambiguities can be resolved.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of non-top-facing stickers that must be seen to fully identify the PLL case is 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
