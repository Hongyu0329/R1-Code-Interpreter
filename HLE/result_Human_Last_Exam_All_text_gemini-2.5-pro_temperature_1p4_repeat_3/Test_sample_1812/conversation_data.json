    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the determinant of the given matrix.\n\n**1. Identify the Matrix**\nThe problem asks for the determinant of the matrix A, which is given as:\n\\[\nA = \\begin{bmatrix} \n2 & -1 & -1 \\\\ \n-1 & 2 & -1 \\\\ \n-1 & -1 & 2 \n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nThe information about the \"Markov quiver for \\( m_{1/2} = 13 \\)\" provides the context from which this matrix arises, but it is not necessary for the computation of the determinant itself. The core task is to find \\( \\det(A) \\).\n\n**2. Choose a Method for Calculating the Determinant**\nFor a 3x3 matrix, there are several standard methods:\n*   Sarrus' Rule (the diagonal method).\n*   Cofactor expansion.\n*   Row reduction to triangular form.\n*   Using matrix properties (like eigenvalues).\n\nWe can use any of these. Using multiple methods is a good way to verify the result.\n\n**Method 1: Sarrus' Rule**\nFor a 3x3 matrix \\( \\begin{bmatrix} a & b & c \\\\ d & e & f \\\\ g & h & i \\end{bmatrix} \\), the determinant is \\( (aei + bfg + cdh) - (gec + hfa + idb) \\).\n\nFor our matrix A:\n*   a = 2, b = -1, c = -1\n*   d = -1, e = 2, f = -1\n*   g = -1, h = -1, i = 2\n\nCalculate the products for the forward diagonals:\n*   \\( aei = (2)(2)(2) = 8 \\)\n*   \\( bfg = (-1)(-1)(-1) = -1 \\)\n*   \\( cdh = (-1)(-1)(-1) = -1 \\)\n\nSum of forward diagonal products = \\( 8 + (-1) + (-1) = 6 \\).\n\nCalculate the products for the backward diagonals:\n*   \\( gec = (-1)(2)(-1) = 2 \\)\n*   \\( hfa = (-1)(-1)(2) = 2 \\)\n*   \\( idb = (2)(-1)(-1) = 2 \\)\n\nSum of backward diagonal products = \\( 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 \\).\n\nThe determinant is the difference between these two sums:\n\\( \\det(A) = 6 - 6 = 0 \\).\n\n**Method 2: Cofactor Expansion**\nWe can expand along any row or column. Let's expand along the first row:\n\\[ \\det(A) = a_{11}C_{11} + a_{12}C_{12} + a_{13}C_{13} \\]\nwhere \\( C_{ij} = (-1)^{i+j}M_{ij} \\) and \\( M_{ij} \\) is the determinant of the 2x2 submatrix formed by removing row i and column j.\n\n*   Term 1: \\( a_{11}C_{11} = 2 \\cdot (-1)^{1+1} \\begin{vmatrix} 2 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 2 \\end{vmatrix} = 2 \\cdot 1 \\cdot ((2)(2) - (-1)(-1)) = 2(4 - 1) = 2(3) = 6 \\)\n*   Term 2: \\( a_{12}C_{12} = (-1) \\cdot (-1)^{1+2} \\begin{vmatrix} -1 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 2 \\end{vmatrix} = (-1) \\cdot (-1) \\cdot ((-1)(2) - (-1)(-1)) = 1(-2 - 1) = 1(-3) = -3 \\)\n*   Term 3: \\( a_{13}C_{13} = (-1) \\cdot (-1)^{1+3} \\begin{vmatrix} -1 & 2 \\\\ -1 & -1 \\end{vmatrix} = (-1) \\cdot 1 \\cdot ((-1)(-1) - (2)(-1)) = -1(1 + 2) = -1(3) = -3 \\)\n\nThe determinant is the sum of these terms:\n\\( \\det(A) = 6 + (-3) + (-3) = 6 - 3 - 3 = 0 \\).\n\n**Method 3: Using Matrix Properties**\nA key property of a square matrix is that if the sum of the elements in any row or any column is zero, then its determinant is zero. Let's check the row sums for matrix A:\n*   Row 1: \\( 2 + (-1) + (-1) = 0 \\)\n*   Row 2: \\( (-1) + 2 + (-1) = 0 \\)\n*   Row 3: \\( (-1) + (-1) + 2 = 0 \\)\nSince the sum of each row is 0, the vectors in the rows are linearly dependent. Specifically, if we let \\( \\mathbf{v} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\), then \\( A\\mathbf{v} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = 0 \\cdot \\mathbf{v} \\). This shows that 0 is an eigenvalue of the matrix A. The determinant of a matrix is the product of its eigenvalues. Since one of the eigenvalues is 0, the product must be 0.\nTherefore, \\( \\det(A) = 0 \\).\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   Double-check arithmetic, especially with negative signs.\n*   Ensure the correct formula for the determinant is used (Sarrus' rule or cofactor expansion).\n*   Recognizing the property that row sums are zero provides the quickest path to the answer and serves as a strong confirmation.\n*   The contextual information about the Markov quiver is extraneous to the calculation but correctly identifies the matrix in question.\n\nAll methods consistently yield the same result.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe computation from all three methods confirms that the determinant of the matrix A is 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
