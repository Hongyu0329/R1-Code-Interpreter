    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the smallest and largest possible rank of the Neron-Severi group of $X = C^{(15)}$, where $C$ is a genus 3 Riemann surface.\n\n### Step 1: Relate the Neron-Severi Rank of $X$ to the Jacobian of $C$\n\nLet $C$ be a smooth projective curve of genus $g$ over the complex numbers $\\mathbb{C}$. Let $X = C^{(d)}$ be its $d$-th symmetric power. The Neron-Severi group of $X$, denoted $NS(X)$, is the group of divisor classes on $X$ modulo algebraic equivalence. Its rank, $\\rho(X)$, is the Picard number of $X$.\n\nLet $J(C)$ be the Jacobian of $C$, which is a principally polarized abelian variety of dimension $g$. For $d \\ge 2g-1$, the Abel-Jacobi map $u_d: C^{(d)} \\to J(C)$ presents $C^{(d)}$ as a projective bundle over $J(C)$. Specifically, it is a $\\mathbb{P}^{d-g}$-bundle.\n\nFor a projective bundle $\\mathbb{P}(E)$ over a variety $Y$, the rank of the Neron-Severi group is given by $\\rho(\\mathbb{P}(E)) = \\rho(Y) + 1$.\n\nIn our case, $C$ has genus $g=3$, and $X$ is the 15th symmetric power, so $d=15$. We check the condition $d \\ge 2g-1$:\n$15 \\ge 2(3) - 1 = 5$.\nSince the condition holds, $X = C^{(15)}$ is a projective bundle over $J(C)$. Therefore, the rank of its Neron-Severi group is:\n$\\rho(X) = \\rho(C^{(15)}) = \\rho(J(C)) + 1$.\n\nThe problem now reduces to finding the smallest and largest possible values for $\\rho(J(C))$ as $C$ varies over all genus 3 curves.\n\n### Step 2: The Rank of the Neron-Severi Group of a Jacobian\n\nFor a principally polarized abelian variety $A$, such as the Jacobian $J(C)$, the rank of its Neron-Severi group is given by the rank of the abelian group of symmetric endomorphisms with respect to the Rosati involution. Let $\\text{End}(J(C))$ be the endomorphism ring of $J(C))$. Then:\n$\\rho(J(C)) = \\text{rank}(\\text{End}^s(J(C)))$.\n\n### Step 3: Finding the Smallest Possible Rank\n\nThe smallest possible rank occurs when the endomorphism ring of $J(C)$ is as small as possible.\n*   For any non-zero abelian variety, the ring of integers $\\mathbb{Z}$ is always a subring of its endomorphism ring, corresponding to multiplication-by-$n$ maps.\n*   For a **generic** curve $C$ of genus $g=3$, its Jacobian $J(C)$ is a simple abelian variety and has no extra endomorphisms beyond the integers. This is the case of no Complex Multiplication (CM).\n*   In this case, $\\text{End}(J(C)) = \\mathbb{Z}$.\n*   The Rosati involution acts as the identity on $\\mathbb{Z}$. Thus, all endomorphisms are symmetric: $\\text{End}^s(J(C)) = \\mathbb{Z}$.\n*   The rank of this group is $\\text{rank}(\\mathbb{Z}) = 1$.\n\nSo, the minimum possible value for the rank of the Neron-Severi group of the Jacobian is:\n$\\rho(J(C))_{min} = 1$.\n\nThis leads to the smallest possible rank for $\\rho(X)$:\n$\\rho(X)_{min} = \\rho(J(C))_{min} + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2$.\n\n### Step 4: Finding the Largest Possible Rank\n\nThe largest possible rank occurs for very special curves $C$ whose Jacobians have a large endomorphism algebra (the case of Complex Multiplication).\n*   For an abelian variety $A$ of dimension $g$, the rank of its Neron-Severi group is bounded by the dimension of the Hodge group, which in turn gives the well-known bound $\\rho(A) \\le g^2$.\n*   For $J(C)$, with $g=3$, we have the upper bound: $\\rho(J(C)) \\le 3^2 = 9$.\n\nWe must verify if this theoretical maximum is achievable. The maximum is achieved when $J(C)$ has the largest possible endomorphism algebra. This occurs for certain curves with CM.\n*   Consider a genus 3 curve $C$ whose Jacobian $J(C)$ is isogenous to the cube of an elliptic curve with complex multiplication. Let $E$ be such an elliptic curve (e.g., $y^2 = x^3 - x$, with CM by $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$). Let $K = \\text{End}^0(E)$ be the CM field (e.g., $K=\\mathbb{Q}(i)$).\n*   If $J(C)$ is isogenous to $E^3 = E \\times E \\times E$, then its endomorphism algebra is $\\text{End}^0(J(C)) \\cong M_3(K)$, the algebra of $3 \\times 3$ matrices with entries in $K$.\n*   For such an algebra, the dimension of the subspace of symmetric elements with respect to the Rosati involution is known to be $g^2$.\n*   In our case, with $g=3$, this dimension is $3^2 = 9$. Thus, $\\rho(J(C)) = 9$.\n*   A specific example of such a curve is the **Fermat curve** of degree 4, given by the equation $x^4 + y^4 + z^4 = 0$. This is a smooth curve of genus 3, and its Jacobian is known to be isogenous to the cube of the elliptic curve $y^2 = x^3 - x$, which has CM by $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$.\n\nSo, the maximum possible value for the rank of the Neron-Severi group of the Jacobian is:\n$\\rho(J(C))_{max} = 9$.\n\nThis leads to the largest possible rank for $\\rho(X)$:\n$\\rho(X)_{max} = \\rho(J(C))_{max} + 1 = 9 + 1 = 10$.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe rank of the Neron-Severi group of $J(C)$ for a genus 3 curve $C$ can range from 1 (for a generic curve) to 9 (for a specific CM curve like the Fermat quartic). Consequently, the rank of the Neron-Severi group of $X=C^{(15)}$ ranges from $1+1=2$ to $9+1=10$.\n\n*   **Smallest possible rank:** 2\n*   **Largest possible rank:** 10\n\nThe smallest rank is 2 and the largest is 10.\n\n<<<The smallest possible rank is 2 and the largest possible rank is 10.>>>"
