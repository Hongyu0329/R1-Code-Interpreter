    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core of the question.**\nThe question asks to identify a specific character from Andrei Tarkovsky's 1972 film *Solaris*. The identifying feature of this character is a specific emotional confession: being \"ashamed to miss the sound of leaves rustling on Earth.\"\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the central themes of the film relevant to the question.**\nTarkovsky's *Solaris* is less about science fiction and more about the human condition, memory, conscience, and our connection to our home, Earth. A major recurring motif is the contrast between the sterile, artificial environment of the space station and the lush, organic, living world of Earth, which is almost exclusively represented by protagonist Kris Kelvin's memories of his dacha (country house). The sounds of nature—rain, running water, wind, and rustling leaves—are powerful symbols of this lost home.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate each character based on these themes and their role in the film.**\n\n*   **A. Kris Kelvin:** He is the protagonist, a psychologist sent from Earth to the Solaris station. The entire film is framed by his experience. The opening scenes on Earth establish his deep, albeit subconscious, connection to nature. His journey is one of realizing what he has lost by leaving Earth. He is the character most tormented by memory and nostalgia. It is highly plausible that he would be the one to express this specific sentiment.\n\n*   **B. Hari:** She is a \"guest,\" a physical manifestation of Kris's deceased wife created by the Solaris ocean from his memories. She has no direct experience of Earth herself; her knowledge is second-hand, filtered through Kris's mind. Therefore, she cannot \"miss\" something she never knew. Her struggle is about her own existence, not nostalgia for a place she's never been.\n\n*   **C. Snaut:** He is one of the scientists who has been on the station for a long time. He has become cynical and weary, engaging in long philosophical discussions with Kris. While he is certainly detached from Earth, his dialogue tends to be more abstract and intellectual. The emotion of being \"ashamed\" for missing something so simple and specific is more personal and poetic than his typical manner of speaking.\n\n*   **D. Sartorius:** He is the other surviving scientist. He is portrayed as cold, rigidly scientific, and emotionally detached. He views emotions like nostalgia as a weakness and a distraction from his work. He is the least likely character to admit to such a feeling, as he is actively trying to suppress his humanity in favor of pure science.\n\n*   **E. Gibarian:** He is the scientist who committed suicide before Kris's arrival. We see him in a video recording and as a \"guest.\" His messages are filled with despair and warnings about the phenomenon on Solaris, but he does not express this particular nostalgic sentiment.\n\n**Step 4: Pinpoint the specific scene and dialogue.**\nThe line is spoken by Kris Kelvin during a profound conversation with Snaut. Kris is reflecting on humanity's purpose in space, suggesting that humans are not truly seeking contact but are looking for a mirror of themselves. He then expresses a deep sense of personal loss and alienation, admitting his shame at having forgotten, or failed to appreciate, the simple sound of leaves on Earth. This confession marks a key point in his emotional journey, highlighting his growing disillusionment with the space mission and his deep yearning for his terrestrial home.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the analysis of the film's themes and the specific personalities and journeys of the characters, the character who is ashamed to miss the sound of leaves rustling is the protagonist, Kris Kelvin.\n\n<<<A>>>"
