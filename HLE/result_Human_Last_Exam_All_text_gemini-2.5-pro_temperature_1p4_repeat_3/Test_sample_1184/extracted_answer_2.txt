**1) Hotspot Residues for Interaction (Binding) with the Alpha-1 Subunit:**
These residues are located in the Guanylate Kinase (GK) domain and form the hydrophobic Alpha-Binding Pocket (ABP) that directly binds the Alpha Interaction Domain (AID) of the alpha-1 subunit.

*   **Y300** (Tyrosine at position 300)
*   **W328** (Tryptophan at position 328)
*   **V350** (Valine at position 350)
*   **L438** (Leucine at position 438)
*   **A440** (Alanine at position 440)
*   **Y480** (Tyrosine at position 480)
*   **I482** (Isoleucine at position 482)

**2) Hotspot Residues for Fine-Tuning Gating Properties of the Alpha-1 Subunit:**
These residues are critical for the allosteric modulation of channel function and are not necessarily part of the primary binding interface.

*   **D215** (Aspartic acid at position 215): Located in the SH3 domain, this residue acts as a "fulcrum" to balance the voltage-dependence of channel activation and inactivation.
*   **K217** (Lysine at position 217) and **E261** (Glutamic acid at position 261): This pair forms a key intramolecular salt bridge between the SH3 domain (K217) and the HOOK region (E261). This interaction maintains the specific conformation of the beta-1 subunit required for its proper modulatory effect on the alpha-1 subunit.
