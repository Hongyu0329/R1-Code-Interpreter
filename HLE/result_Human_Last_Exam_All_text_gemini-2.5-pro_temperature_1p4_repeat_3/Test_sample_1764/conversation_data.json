    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the question\nThe question asks for the smallest possible number of isometric embeddings of a finite ultrametric space $X$ into a Banach space $B$ of cardinality $K$.\n\nLet's define the key terms:\n*   **Finite Ultrametric Space $X$**: A finite set $X$ with a distance function $d: X \\times X \\to \\mathbb{R}$ that satisfies:\n    1.  $d(x, y) \\ge 0$ (non-negativity)\n    2.  $d(x, y) = 0 \\iff x = y$ (identity)\n    3.  $d(x, y) = d(y, x)$ (symmetry)\n    4.  $d(x, z) \\le \\max(d(x, y), d(y, z))$ (strong triangle inequality or ultrametric inequality)\n    The condition \"finite\" means the set $X$ has a finite number of points. A space with just one point is a valid finite ultrametric space.\n\n*   **Banach Space $B$**: A complete normed vector space. By standard definition, the vector space is over the field of real numbers $\\mathbb{R}$ or complex numbers $\\mathbb{C}$.\n    *   The cardinality of $B$ is denoted by $K$. If $B$ is a Banach space over $\\mathbb{R}$ or $\\mathbb{C}$, its cardinality $K$ can be 1 (for the trivial space $B=\\{0\\}$) or at least the cardinality of the continuum, $2^{\\aleph_0}$ (for any non-trivial space).\n\n*   **Isometric Embedding**: A function $f: X \\to B$ that preserves distances. This means that for all $x, y \\in X$, the following equality must hold:\n    $\\|f(x) - f(y)\\|_B = d(x, y)$, where $\\|\\cdot\\|_B$ is the norm in the Banach space $B$.\n\n*   **Smallest Possible Number**: The question asks for the minimum value of the number of possible isometric embeddings. This implies we are free to choose the space $X$ and the Banach space $B$ (that fit the description) in such a way as to make this number as small as possible. The question implicitly assumes that embeddings exist for the pairs $(X,B)$ we consider.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the trivial case\nTo find the smallest possible number, we should examine the simplest possible choices for $X$ and $B$.\n\n*   **Choice of $X$**: The simplest finite ultrametric space is one with a single point. Let $X = \\{p\\}$. The only distance is $d(p, p) = 0$. This is a valid finite ultrametric space.\n*   **Choice of $B$**: The simplest Banach space is the zero space, $B = \\{0\\}$. This is a complete normed vector space over $\\mathbb{R}$ (or $\\mathbb{C}$) consisting of only the zero vector. Its norm is $\\|0\\| = 0$. Its cardinality is $K=1$.\n\nNow, let's find the number of isometric embeddings of this $X$ into this $B$.\n*   An embedding is a map $f: \\{p\\} \\to \\{0\\}$. There is only one such function: $f(p) = 0$.\n*   We must check if this map is isometric. The condition is $\\|f(p) - f(p)\\|_B = d(p, p)$.\n    *   The left side is $\\|0 - 0\\|_B = \\|0\\|_B = 0$.\n    *   The right side is $d(p, p) = 0$.\n*   Since $0 = 0$, the condition is satisfied. The function $f(p)=0$ is an isometric embedding.\n*   Since this is the only possible function from $\\{p\\}$ to $\\{0\\}$, there is exactly one isometric embedding in this case.\n\nSo, we have found a valid pair $(X, B)$ for which the number of isometric embeddings is 1.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze non-trivial cases\nLet's see if it's possible to get a smaller number (which is not possible as the number must be a non-negative integer and we assume embeddings exist) or if all other cases yield a larger number of embeddings.\n\nConsider any finite ultrametric space $X$ with at least two points, i.e., $|X| \\ge 2$.\n*   This means there exist $x_1, x_2 \\in X$ such that $x_1 \\neq x_2$, and the distance $d(x_1, x_2) = r > 0$.\n*   Let $f: X \\to B$ be an isometric embedding. Then $\\|f(x_1) - f(x_2)\\|_B = d(x_1, x_2) = r > 0$.\n*   This implies that $f(x_1) - f(x_2)$ cannot be the zero vector, so $B$ cannot be the trivial space $\\{0\\}$.\n*   Thus, $B$ must be a non-trivial Banach space over $\\mathbb{R}$ or $\\mathbb{C}$. The cardinality $K$ of such a space is infinite (at least continuum).\n\nNow, consider the properties of embeddings into a non-trivial vector space.\n*   Let $f$ be one isometric embedding.\n*   For any vector $v \\in B$, define a new function $g_v: X \\to B$ by $g_v(x) = f(x) + v$. This is a translation of the image of $X$.\n*   Let's check if $g_v$ is also an isometric embedding:\n    $\\|g_v(x) - g_v(y)\\|_B = \\|(f(x)+v) - (f(y)+v)\\|_B = \\|f(x) - f(y)\\|_B = d(x, y)$.\n    Yes, it is.\n*   For any two distinct vectors $v_1, v_2 \\in B$ (where $v_1 \\neq v_2$), the functions $g_{v_1}$ and $g_{v_2}$ are distinct. If they were the same, we would have $f(x)+v_1 = f(x)+v_2$ for all $x \\in X$, which implies $v_1 = v_2$, a contradiction.\n*   Since $B$ is a non-trivial Banach space, it contains infinitely many vectors. Therefore, there are infinitely many distinct isometric embeddings of $X$ into $B$.\n\nSo, for any non-trivial space $X$ (with $|X| \\ge 2$) that admits an embedding into a standard Banach space $B$, the number of such embeddings is infinite.\n\n### Step 4: Synthesize the results and conclude\nWe have found two possibilities for the number of isometric embeddings:\n1.  If we choose $X=\\{p\\}$ and $B=\\{0\\}$, the number of embeddings is 1.\n2.  For any $X$ with $|X| \\ge 2$ and any non-trivial Banach space $B$ (into which $X$ can be embedded), the number of embeddings is infinite. It is a known result that any finite metric space can be embedded into a non-trivial Banach space like $\\ell^\\infty(n)$, so this case is always possible for $|X| \\ge 2$.\n\nThe question asks for the **smallest possible number**. Comparing the possible outcomes {1, $\\infty$}, the smallest is 1.\n\nThe reasoning holds even if one considers alternative definitions of a Banach space (e.g., over finite fields). In that case, one can construct examples with a finite number of embeddings (e.g., 2), but since we have already found a valid case where the number is 1, this does not change the minimum.\n\nFinal conclusion: The smallest possible number of isometric embeddings is achieved in the trivial case of a one-point space being embedded into the zero-dimensional Banach space.\n\n<<<1>>>"
