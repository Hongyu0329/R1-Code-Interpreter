    "To find the greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of the two polynomial matrices P1 and P2, we can use the Euclidean algorithm for polynomial matrices. This involves performing elementary column operations on the augmented matrix `N(s) = [P1(s), P2(s)]` to reduce it to the form `[G(s), 0]`. The resulting matrix `G(s)` will be a GCRD of P1 and P2.\n\n**Step 1: Write down the matrices P1 and P2.**\n`P1 = [s^2 + s, -s; -s^2 - 1, s^2]`\n`P2 = [s, 0; -s - 1, 1]`\n\n**Step 2: Form the augmented matrix N(s) = [P1(s), P2(s)].**\n`N(s) = [s^2 + s, -s,   s,    0;`\n`       -s^2 - 1, s^2, -s - 1, 1]`\n\nLet the columns be C1, C2, C3, C4.\n\n**Step 3: Perform elementary column operations to simplify N(s).**\nOur goal is to create zero columns. A good strategy is to use a column with a constant entry to eliminate other entries in the same row. The entry at position (2, 4) is 1. We will use this to make the other entries in the second row zero.\n\n1.  To make the element at (2, 1) zero (which is `-s^2 - 1`), we perform the operation: `C1 <- C1 - (-s^2-1) * C4`, which simplifies to `C1 <- C1 + (s^2+1) * C4`.\n    `New C1 = [s^2 + s, -s^2 - 1] + (s^2+1)*[0, 1] = [s^2+s, -s^2-1 + s^2+1] = [s^2+s, 0]`\n\n2.  To make the element at (2, 2) zero (which is `s^2`), we perform the operation: `C2 <- C2 - s^2 * C4`.\n    `New C2 = [-s, s^2] - s^2*[0, 1] = [-s, s^2 - s^2] = [-s, 0]`\n\n3.  To make the element at (2, 3) zero (which is `-s - 1`), we perform the operation: `C3 <- C3 - (-s-1) * C4`, which simplifies to `C3 <- C3 + (s+1) * C4`.\n    `New C3 = [s, -s-1] + (s+1)*[0, 1] = [s, -s-1 + s+1] = [s, 0]`\n\nAfter these operations, the matrix `N(s)` becomes:\n`N_1(s) = [s^2+s, -s, s, 0;`\n`         0,      0, 0, 1]`\n\n**Step 4: Continue with column operations to further simplify the matrix.**\nNow, the second row is `[0, 0, 0, 1]`. Any operations between the first three columns will not change their second-row entries (which are all zero). We can now simplify the first row of these three columns: `[s^2+s, -s, s]`. Let's use the third column `[s; 0]` to eliminate the first and second columns.\n\n1.  To make the first column `[s^2+s; 0]` zero, we use the fact that `s^2+s = (s+1)*s`. We perform `C1 <- C1 - (s+1) * C3`.\n    `New C1 = [s^2+s, 0] - (s+1)*[s, 0] = [s^2+s - (s^2+s), 0] = [0, 0]`\n\n2.  To make the second column `[-s; 0]` zero, we use `C2 <- C2 + C3`.\n    `New C2 = [-s, 0] + [s, 0] = [0, 0]`\n\nAfter these operations, the matrix becomes:\n`N_2(s) = [0, 0, s, 0;`\n`         0, 0, 0, 1]`\n\n**Step 5: Extract the GCRD.**\nThe matrix is now in the form `[0, G']`. To get the desired form `[G, 0]`, we can perform column swaps (which are also elementary column operations).\nSwap C1 and C3:\n`[s, 0, 0, 0;`\n` 0, 0, 0, 1]`\nSwap C2 and C4:\n`[s, 0, 0, 0;`\n` 0, 1, 0, 0]`\n\nThis matrix has the form `[G, 0]`, where `G` is the GCRD.\n`G(s) = [s, 0;`\n`       0, 1]`\n\nThe greatest common right divisor is unique up to left multiplication by a unimodular matrix (a polynomial matrix with a constant, non-zero determinant). The matrix `[s, 0; 0, 1]` is a GCRD in a simple, diagonal form (Smith-McMillan form at infinity).\n\nFinal Answer is the matrix G(s).\nG(s) = [s, 0; 0, 1]\n\n<<<[s, 0; 0, 1]>>>"
