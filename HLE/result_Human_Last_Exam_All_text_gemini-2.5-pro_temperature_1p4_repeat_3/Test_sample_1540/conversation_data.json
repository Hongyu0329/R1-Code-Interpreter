    "This problem asks us to perform a case-insensitive lexicographical comparison of two strings of the same length and determine the most memory-efficient C program to solve it. We need to find `m`, the total memory in bytes used for the variables in such a program.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Problem Understanding**: The core task is to compare two strings, `s1` and `s2`, lexicographically. The comparison must be case-insensitive, meaning 'a' is treated the same as 'A'. The strings are guaranteed to have the same length, which is between 1 and 100. We need to output -1 if `s1 < s2`, 1 if `s1 > s2`, and 0 if `s1 == s2`.\n\n2.  **Constraint Analysis**: The main constraint is memory efficiency. We need to design a C program that uses the minimum possible amount of memory for its variables.\n\n3.  **Memory Optimization Strategy**:\n    *   **Input Method**: Standard input (`stdin`) is a sequential stream. To compare the first character of string 1 with the first character of string 2, then the second with the second, and so on, we cannot read them in parallel. We must read the first string entirely before the second string becomes available in the input stream.\n    *   **Buffering**: This implies that we must store at least the first string in memory to be able to reference its characters while we read the second string. Therefore, a buffer for the first string is unavoidable.\n    *   **Minimizing Buffers**: To be maximally memory-efficient, we should avoid creating a buffer for the second string. Instead, we can read it one character at a time from the input stream and perform the comparison on-the-fly against the corresponding character from the buffered first string.\n\n4.  **Variable Declaration and Sizing**: Based on the strategy above, let's identify the necessary variables and their most efficient data types.\n    *   **String 1 Buffer**: The maximum length is 100 characters. In C, a string requires a null terminator (`\\0`). So, the buffer size must be at least `100 + 1 = 101`. The `char` data type is appropriate.\n        *   `char s1[101];` -> Memory: `101 * sizeof(char)` = 101 bytes.\n    *   **Loop Counter**: We need an index to iterate through the characters of the buffered string `s1`. Since the length is at most 100, the index will go from 0 to 99. The smallest integer type that can hold this range is `unsigned char` (range 0-255). This is more memory-efficient than a standard `int` (which is typically 4 bytes).\n        *   `unsigned char i;` -> Memory: `sizeof(unsigned char)` = 1 byte.\n    *   **String 2 Character Holder**: We need a variable to temporarily store each character of the second string as we read it from the input stream. A `char` is sufficient.\n        *   `char c2;` -> Memory: `sizeof(char)` = 1 byte.\n\n    No other variables are strictly necessary. The comparison `tolower(s1[i]) < tolower(c2)` can be done directly in an `if` statement without storing the results of `tolower` in additional temporary variables.\n\n### Listing Careful Points\n\n1.  **Case-Insensitive Comparison**: It is crucial to use a function like `tolower()` from `<ctype.h>` on characters from both strings before comparing them to ignore case.\n2.  **Buffer Sizing**: Forgetting the null terminator (`\\0`) is a common mistake. A string of length 100 needs a `char` array of size 101.\n3.  **Data Type Selection**: Choosing the smallest possible data type for variables (e.g., `unsigned char` for a small-range counter) is key to memory efficiency.\n4.  **Input Stream Handling**: After reading the first string with `scanf(\"%s\", ...)` a newline character (`\\n`) remains in the input buffer. This must be consumed (e.g., with `getchar()`) before starting to read the second string character by character.\n5.  **Same Length Guarantee**: The problem guarantees the strings have the same length, which simplifies the logic. We can loop until the null terminator of the first string, and we will have read exactly all characters of the second string.\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer\n\nThe total memory `m` is the sum of the memory allocated for all variables in our memory-efficient design.\n\n*   Memory for the first string's buffer: 101 bytes\n*   Memory for the loop counter: 1 byte\n*   Memory for the second string's character holder: 1 byte\n\nTotal memory `m` = 101 + 1 + 1 = 103 bytes.\n\n<<<103>>>"
