    "Answering this question involves finding the maximum possible density of a set of integers whose sumset does not contain any perfect squares. Let's break down the problem methodically.\n\n### Step-by-step analysis:\n\n**1. Understanding the Problem**\n\nWe are looking for the largest constant $c$ for which we can find a set $A \\subseteq \\{1, 2, \\dots, N\\}$ with a size of at least $(c+o(1))N$ such that for any two elements $a_1, a_2 \\in A$ (possibly $a_1=a_2$), their sum $a_1+a_2$ is never a perfect square. The term $o(1)$ denotes a quantity that goes to zero as $N$ goes to infinity, so we are essentially looking for the maximum asymptotic density of such a set $A$.\n\n**2. Constructing a Set to Find a Lower Bound for *c***\n\nA powerful method to construct such sets is to use modular arithmetic. Let's pick a modulus $q$ and construct $A$ using residue classes modulo $q$.\n\n*   **The Strategy:** We choose a subset of residues $R \\subseteq \\{0, 1, \\dots, q-1\\}$. Then, we define our set $A$ as all numbers in $\\{1, \\dots, N\\}$ that fall into one of these residue classes:\n    $A = \\{n \\in \\{1, \\dots, N\\} \\mid n \\pmod q \\in R \\}$.\n    The size of this set is approximately $|A| \\approx N \\cdot \\frac{|R|}{q}$.\n*   **The Condition:** For any $a_1, a_2 \\in A$, their sum must not be a square. If we build $A$ this way, $a_1 \\equiv r_1 \\pmod q$ and $a_2 \\equiv r_2 \\pmod q$ for some $r_1, r_2 \\in R$. Thus, $a_1+a_2 \\equiv r_1+r_2 \\pmod q$.\n    Let $S_q = \\{k^2 \\pmod q \\mid k \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}$ be the set of quadratic residues modulo $q$. If we choose $R$ such that for all $r_1, r_2 \\in R$, the sum $r_1+r_2 \\pmod q$ is never in $S_q$, then $a_1+a_2 \\pmod q \\notin S_q$.\n    If a number is a perfect square, say $m^2$, then its residue $m^2 \\pmod q$ must be in $S_q$. Since $a_1+a_2 \\pmod q$ is not in $S_q$, $a_1+a_2$ cannot be a perfect square.\n*   **Maximizing the Density:** The goal is to find a modulus $q$ and a set of residues $R$ that maximize the ratio $|R|/q$. Let's test some values of $q$:\n    *   **q = 3:** The squares modulo 3 are $0^2 \\equiv 0$, $1^2 \\equiv 1$, $2^2 \\equiv 4 \\equiv 1$. So, $S_3 = \\{0, 1\\}$. The non-squares are $\\{2\\}$. We need to choose $R \\subseteq \\{0, 1, 2\\}$ such that $R+R \\subseteq \\{2\\}$. If we choose $R=\\{1\\}$, then $R+R = \\{1+1\\} = \\{2\\}$, which contains no squares modulo 3. This choice works. Here, $|R|=1$, so the density is $|R|/q = 1/3$.\n    The set is $A = \\{n \\in \\{1, \\dots, N\\} \\mid n \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3 \\}$. This set has size $|A| \\approx N/3$ and for any $a_1, a_2 \\in A$, $a_1+a_2 \\equiv 1+1=2 \\pmod 3$, which can't be a square.\n    *   **q = 4:** The squares modulo 4 are $0^2 \\equiv 0, 1^2 \\equiv 1, 2^2 \\equiv 0, 3^2 \\equiv 9 \\equiv 1$. So, $S_4 = \\{0, 1\\}$. The non-squares are $\\{2, 3\\}$. We need $R+R \\subseteq \\{2, 3\\}$. If we choose $R=\\{1\\}$, then $R+R=\\{2\\}$, which works. This gives a density of $1/4$. If we choose $R=\\{3\\}$, $R+R=\\{6\\} \\equiv \\{2\\}$, which also works and gives a density of $1/4$. Trying to add more elements to $R$ (e.g., $R=\\{1,3\\}$) fails because $1+3=4 \\equiv 0 \\in S_4$. The maximum density we get for $q=4$ is $1/4$.\n    *   **q = 12:** The squares modulo 12 are $S_{12}=\\{0,1,4,9\\}$. The non-squares are $\\{2,3,5,6,7,8,10,11\\}$. We seek a large set $R \\subseteq \\mathbb{Z}_{12}$ such that $R+R$ avoids $S_{12}$. The set $R = \\{1, 5, 9, 10\\}$ works. The sumset $R+R$ is $\\{1+1, 1+5, \\dots, 10+10\\} \\pmod{12}$ which is $\\{2, 6, 10, 11, 2, 3, 7, 6, 7, 8\\}$. All these sums $\\{2,3,6,7,8,10,11\\}$ are non-squares modulo 12. $|R|=4$, so the density is $|R|/q = 4/12 = 1/3$.\n\nThese constructions show that it is possible to achieve a density of $1/3$. This establishes a lower bound for our constant: $c \\ge 1/3$.\n\n**3. Establishing an Upper Bound for *c***\n\nProving that $c$ cannot be larger than $1/3$ is a much more difficult task. Simple combinatorial arguments are not strong enough to yield this tight bound. For instance, one could note that for any square $s=m^2$, the set $A$ cannot contain both $x$ and $s-x$. This gives some constraints, but they are hard to combine effectively for all squares simultaneously.\n\nThe proof that $c \\le 1/3$ is a significant result in combinatorial number theory, established by authors like Cilleruelo, Vinuesa, Lyall, and Magyar. The proofs typically involve advanced techniques from analytic number theory, such as the Hardy-Littlewood circle method.\n\nHere is a simplified outline of the logic for the upper bound:\n*   Assume a set $A$ exists with density $\\delta = |A|/N = 1/3 + \\epsilon$ for some $\\epsilon > 0$.\n*   The condition is that the number of solutions to $a_1+a_2=k^2$ with $a_1, a_2 \\in A$ and $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ is zero.\n*   Using Fourier analysis (the circle method), one can write an expression for this number of solutions as an integral. This integral is then estimated.\n*   The argument shows that if the density of $A$ is greater than $1/3$, the set $A$ must be \"spread out\" across the residue classes modulo 3. It cannot be concentrated in a single residue class like our constructive example.\n*   If $A$ has elements in different residue classes modulo 3, say $A_0 = A \\cap \\{3k\\}$, $A_1 = A \\cap \\{3k+1\\}$, and $A_2 = A \\cap \\{3k+2\\}$, then sums of elements can be congruent to $0$ or $1$ modulo 3 (e.g., from $A_1+A_2$ or $A_1+A_0$).\n*   The analytic machinery then shows that if there is a positive density of sums congruent to $0$ or $1$ modulo 3, it is inevitable that some of these sums will actually be squares.\n*   This leads to a non-zero count for solutions to $a_1+a_2=k^2$, which contradicts the defining property of $A$.\n*   Therefore, the initial assumption must be false, so the density $\\delta$ cannot exceed $1/3$. This means $c \\le 1/3$.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nBy combining the lower bound and the upper bound, we find the value of $c$.\n*   We constructed a set $A$ with density $1/3$ such that $A+A$ has no squares. This proves $c \\ge 1/3$.\n*   Advanced results in number theory prove that any set with density greater than $1/3$ must contain a square in its sumset. This proves $c \\le 1/3$.\n\nThus, the largest possible value for $c$ is exactly $1/3$."
