    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of elements of the homology cobordism group represented by integral surgery on knots with at most four crossings.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\n*   **Homology Cobordism Group ($\\Theta^3_H$)**: This is the set of equivalence classes of integer homology 3-spheres, where two are equivalent if they co-bound an integer homology cobordism. The group operation is the connected sum (#). The identity element is the class of the standard 3-sphere, $S^3$.\n*   **Integral Surgery on a Knot**: This process creates a 3-manifold, denoted $S^3_n(K)$, by removing a neighborhood of a knot $K \\subset S^3$ and gluing it back with a twist determined by an integer $n$.\n*   **Condition for Homology Sphere**: For $S^3_n(K)$ to be an integer homology 3-sphere (i.e., having the same integer homology groups as $S^3$), its first homology group $H_1(S^3_n(K);\\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/|n|\\mathbb{Z}$ must be trivial. This requires $|n|=1$.\n*   **The Goal**: We need to find how many distinct elements in $\\Theta^3_H$ are represented by the manifolds $S^3_{+1}(K)$ and $S^3_{-1}(K)$ for all knots $K$ with four or fewer crossings.\n\n### Step 2: List the Knots with At Most Four Crossings\nWe need to consider all prime knots up to four crossings, plus the unknot.\n1.  **0 crossings**: The unknot, $0_1$.\n2.  **3 crossings**: The right-handed trefoil knot, $3_1$, and its mirror image, the left-handed trefoil.\n3.  **4 crossings**: The figure-eight knot, $4_1$. This knot is amphichiral, meaning it is equivalent to its own mirror image.\n\nWe will now analyze the results of $\\pm 1$ surgery on each of these knots.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Surgery Manifolds\n\n**1. The Unknot ($0_1$)**\n*   **+1 surgery on the unknot**: $S^3_{+1}(0_1)$ is diffeomorphic to $S^3$.\n*   **-1 surgery on the unknot**: $S^3_{-1}(0_1)$ is also diffeomorphic to $S^3$.\n*   Both surgeries produce the 3-sphere $S^3$, which represents the **trivial element** (the identity) in the homology cobordism group $\\Theta^3_H$.\n*   **Contribution**: 1 element (the trivial one).\n\n**2. The Figure-Eight Knot ($4_1$)**\n*   Consider $+1$ surgery, $S^3_{+1}(4_1)$. A fundamental result by Selman Akbulut shows that the 4-manifold traced out by this surgery (obtained by adding a 2-handle to a 4-ball along the figure-eight knot with framing +1) is a contractible manifold.\n*   A homology sphere that bounds a contractible manifold is homology cobordant to $S^3$. Therefore, $S^3_{+1}(4_1)$ represents the **trivial element** in $\\Theta^3_H$.\n*   Consider $-1$ surgery, $S^3_{-1}(4_1)$. Since the figure-eight knot is amphichiral, there is an orientation-reversing diffeomorphism of $S^3$ taking $4_1$ to itself. This implies that $S^3_{-1}(4_1)$ is diffeomorphic to the orientation-reversal of $S^3_{+1}(4_1)$. Since $S^3_{+1}(4_1)$ is homology cobordant to $S^3$, so is its orientation-reversal.\n*   Both surgeries on the figure-eight knot produce homology spheres that represent the **trivial element**.\n*   **Contribution**: 0 new elements.\n\n**3. The Trefoil Knot ($3_1$ and its mirror)**\n*   **Surgery on the right-handed trefoil ($3_1$)**:\n    *   $-1$ surgery on $3_1$ produces the Poincaré homology sphere, denoted $P$.\n    *   $+1$ surgery on $3_1$ produces the orientation-reversal of the Poincaré sphere, $-P$.\n*   **Surgery on the left-handed trefoil (mirror of $3_1$)**:\n    *   $+1$ surgery on the left-handed trefoil yields $-S^3_{-1}(3_1)$, which is $-P$.\n    *   $-1$ surgery on the left-handed trefoil yields $-S^3_{+1}(3_1)$, which is $-(-P) = P$.\n*   So, surgeries on the trefoil knots give us two potential elements in $\\Theta^3_H$: the class of the Poincaré sphere, $[P]$, and the class of its inverse, $[-P]$.\n\n### Step 4: Distinguishing the Elements from the Trefoil Surgery\n\nWe must determine:\na) Is $[P]$ a non-trivial element?\nb) Are $[P]$ and $[-P]$ distinct elements?\n\n*   **a) Triviality of $[P]$**: We can use a homology cobordism invariant to check this. The Rohlin invariant, $\\mu$, is a homomorphism $\\mu: \\Theta^3_H \\to \\mathbb{Z}_2$. The Poincaré sphere $P$ is known to bound the $E_8$ plumbing 4-manifold, which has signature $-8$. This gives $\\mu(P) = -8/8 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$. Since $\\mu(S^3) = 0$, $P$ is not homology cobordant to $S^3$. Thus, **$[P]$ is a non-trivial element**.\n\n*   **b) Distinction between $[P]$ and $[-P]$**: In the group $\\Theta^3_H$, the element $[-P]$ is the inverse of $[P]$. They are the same element if and only if $[P]$ is its own inverse, i.e., $[P] = -[P]$, which is equivalent to saying the element has order 2 ($[P] + [P] = [P]\\#[P] = \\text{identity}$). This means that the connected sum $P\\#P$ must be homology cobordant to $S^3$.\n*   A celebrated result by Fintushel and Stern (1981) shows that $P\\#P$ does indeed bound an acyclic 4-manifold. This implies that $P\\#P$ is homology cobordant to $S^3$.\n*   Therefore, the class $[P]$ has order 2 in $\\Theta^3_H$. This means $[P] = -[P]$.\n*   Consequently, the classes represented by $P$ and $-P$ are the **same element**. All four surgeries on the trefoil knots ($+1$ and $-1$ on both the right-handed and left-handed versions) yield this single non-trivial element.\n*   **Contribution**: 1 new element (the non-trivial class of the Poincaré sphere).\n\n### Step 5: Final Count\nLet's tally the distinct elements we have found:\n\n1.  **The trivial element**: Represented by $S^3$, and obtained from surgery on the unknot and the figure-eight knot.\n2.  **The non-trivial element [P]**: Represented by the Poincaré sphere, and obtained from surgery on the trefoil knot and its mirror.\n\nThese are the only two distinct elements. No other knots with at most four crossings exist.\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 2 distinct elements of the homology cobordism group that can be represented by integral surgery on a knot with at most four crossings.\n\n<<<2>>>"
