    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Question:** The core of the question is to identify the specific range of verses (*bayts*) in the poem *'Aqeedat al-'Awaam* where the author, Sayyid Ahmad al-Marzuqi, lists the names of the Prophets.\n\n2.  **Recall the Structure of the Poem:** *'Aqeedat al-'Awaam* is a short matn (text) of about 57 bayts that systematically outlines the essentials of Islamic creed. It covers:\n    *   The attributes of Allah.\n    *   The attributes and names of the Prophets.\n    *   The Divine Books.\n    *   The Angels.\n    *   The Last Day and other related beliefs.\n\n3.  **Locate the Section on Prophets:** The section detailing the Prophets comes after the discussion of Allah's twenty necessary attributes. This section is itself divided into two parts: first, a mention of the four necessary attributes of the Prophets (Truthfulness, Trustworthiness, Conveying the Message, and Intelligence), and second, the enumeration of the 25 Prophets whose names it is necessary to know.\n\n4.  **Identify the Starting Bayt of the List:** The enumeration of the names begins directly after the introductory verses about the Prophets. In the most standard and widely recognized 57-bayt version of the poem, the list of names starts at **bayt 29**. This bayt begins by naming the first group of Prophets:\n    *   هُمْ آدَمٌ إِدْرِيسُ نُوحٌ هُودٌ مَعْ * صَالِحٍ وَإِبْرَاهِيمُ كُلٌّ مُتَّبِعْ\n    *   Translation: *They are Adam, Idris, Nuh, Hud along with / Salih and Ibrahim, each is a follower (of truth).*\n\n5.  **Identify the Ending Bayt of the List:** The poem continues to list the names of the Prophets over the next few bayts. The final bayt in this sequence mentions the last group of Prophets, concluding with Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), who is referred to by one of his names, 'Taha', and described as the 'Seal' of the Prophets. This is **bayt 32**:\n    *   إِلْيَاسُ يُونُسُ زَكَرِيَّا يَحْيَى * عِيسَى وَطَهَ خَاتِمٌ دَعْ غَيَّا\n    *   Translation: *Ilyas, Yunus, Zakariyya, Yahya / 'Isa and Taha (Muhammad ﷺ), the Seal; leave misguidance.*\n\n6.  **Confirm the Range:** The list of the 25 Prophets begins in bayt 29 and concludes at the end of bayt 32. Thus, the names are mentioned within these four bayts (29, 30, 31, and 32).\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Verse Numbering:** There can be minor variations in the numbering of verses between different publications of the poem. However, the analysis here uses the most common and standard 57-bayt structure, which is overwhelmingly recognized in traditional teaching circles.\n\n2.  **Introductory Verses:** The verses immediately preceding bayt 29 (such as the one mentioning the obligation to know the Prophets) are related to the topic but do not contain the names themselves. The question specifically asks for the bayts where the *names are mentioned*.\n\n3.  **Completeness of the List:** The identified range from bayt 29 to bayt 32 contains all 25 of the Prophets required to be known by name in the Ash'ari creed that the poem outlines.\n    *   **Bayt 29:** Adam, Idris, Nuh, Hud, Salih, Ibrahim (6)\n    *   **Bayt 30:** Lut, Isma'il, Ishaq, Ya'qub, Yusuf, Ayyub (6)\n    *   **Bayt 31:** Shu'ayb, Harun, Musa, Al-Yasa', Dhu al-Kifl, Dawud, Sulayman (7)\n    *   **Bayt 32:** Ilyas, Yunus, Zakariyya, Yahya, 'Isa, Taha (Muhammad ﷺ) (6)\n    *   **Total:** 6 + 6 + 7 + 6 = 25 Prophets.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the analysis of the standard text of the poem, the names of the Prophets in Islam are mentioned from **bayt 29 to bayt 32**.\n\n<<<From bayt 29 to bayt 32>>>"
