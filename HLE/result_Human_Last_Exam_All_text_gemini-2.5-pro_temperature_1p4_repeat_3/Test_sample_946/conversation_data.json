    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the key elements of the question.**\nThe question asks for the name of a *fictional singer* whose *cardboard cutout* \"performs\" at the *Junior prom* in the *Homestar Runner* episode *“Teen Girl Squad #15”*.\n\n**Step 2: Locate the specific scene within the episode.**\nWe need to find the part of \"Teen Girl Squad #15\" where the characters are at their Junior prom and there is musical entertainment.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the scene for the performer's identity.**\n*   The Teen Girl Squad arrives at the prom.\n*   Cheerleader points to the stage and exclaims, \"Look! It's an acoustic performance by... Cardboard Singaman!\"\n*   Simultaneously, a cardboard cutout of a male figure holding an acoustic guitar is shown on the stage. The text \"CARDBOARD SINGAMAN\" appears next to it.\n*   The Ugly One then says, \"And he's playing my favorite song! 'You Don't Look So Good (Congressional Medal of Honor Mix)'!\"\n\n**Step 4: Consolidate the findings to answer the question.**\n*   The performer is indeed a cardboard cutout.\n*   The setting is the Junior prom.\n*   The name of the fictional singer is explicitly stated in the dialogue by Cheerleader and reinforced with on-screen text.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   It's important to distinguish that the question asks for the name of the *fictional singer*, not just a description of the cutout. The show conveniently provides a specific name.\n*   The name is a literal description: \"Cardboard Singaman\". This is typical of the humor in \"Homestar Runner\".\n*   The song title, \"'You Don't Look So Good (Congressional Medal of Honor Mix)'\", is an extra detail that confirms we are looking at the correct scene but is not the answer to the question itself.\n\nBased on this analysis, the fictional singer is named Cardboard Singaman.\n\n<<<Cardboard Singaman>>>"
