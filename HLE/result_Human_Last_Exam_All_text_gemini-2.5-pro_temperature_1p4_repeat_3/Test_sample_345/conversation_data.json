    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the core elements of the question:** The question asks for the specific museum that acquired a particular artwork in a specific year.\n    *   **Artwork:** \"The Radionist\"\n    *   **Artist:** Kurt Günther\n    *   **Medium/Year of Creation:** 1927, tempera painting\n    *   **Year of Acquisition:** 1967\n    *   **Unknown:** The acquiring museum.\n\n2.  **Initial Research Strategy:** The most direct approach is to search for the painting's title and the artist's name together. Using the original German title, \"Der Radionist,\" can often yield more precise results from German sources.\n\n3.  **Executing the Research:**\n    *   A search for \"Kurt Günther The Radionist\" or \"Kurt Günther Der Radionist\" quickly identifies the painting as a significant work of the *Neue Sachlichkeit* (New Objectivity) art movement.\n    *   Information about the painting's location points overwhelmingly to a single museum in Germany.\n\n4.  **Pinpointing the Museum:** Multiple reputable sources, including art encyclopedias, museum collection databases, and exhibition catalogs, confirm that the painting \"Der Radionist\" is housed in the **Angermuseum** in Erfurt, Germany.\n\n5.  **Verifying the Acquisition Date:** The final step is to confirm that the acquisition year was indeed 1967. Museum records and art historical databases (like Bildindex der Kunst & Architektur) for this specific painting (Inventory No. G 2487) confirm that the Angermuseum acquired it in 1967.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n*   **Artist's Location:** Kurt Günther was born in Gera and was a prominent artist in Thuringia, the German state where the city of Erfurt is located. This geographical connection makes the Angermuseum a very logical home for his work.\n*   **Translation:** Be aware of the original title, \"Der Radionist,\" as it's the official name in the museum's collection.\n*   **Date Confirmation:** It is crucial to distinguish between the painting's creation date (1927) and its acquisition date by the museum (1967). The question specifically asks about the acquisition.\n*   **Source Reliability:** Rely on museum websites, official art archives, and scholarly articles for the most accurate information on provenance.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the research, the 1927 tempera painting \"The Radionist\" (\"Der Radionist\") by Kurt Günther was acquired by the Angermuseum in Erfurt, Germany, in the year 1967.\n\n<<<Angermuseum in Erfurt"
