    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Define the function F₃(x)**\n\nFirst, let's explicitly write out the function F₃(x) based on the given definitions.\n*   F₀(x) = x\n*   F₁(x) = sin(F₀(x)) = sin(x)\n*   F₂(x) = e^(F₁(x)) = e^(sin(x))\n*   F₃(x) = ln(1 + F₂(x)) = ln(1 + e^(sin(x)))\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Integrand**\n\nThe question asks for the evaluation of the integral of the function `F₃'(x) / F₃(x)`.\nThis expression has a specific form. If we consider a general function `g(x) = ln(f(x))`, its derivative with respect to x, using the chain rule, is `g'(x) = (1/f(x)) * f'(x) = f'(x)/f(x)`.\nIn our case, the integrand `F₃'(x) / F₃(x)` is precisely the derivative of `ln(F₃(x))`.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the Integral using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus**\n\nThe integral we need to evaluate is:\nV = ∫[from 0 to 1] (F₃'(x) / F₃(x)) dx\n\nSince the integrand `F₃'(x) / F₃(x)` is the derivative of `ln(F₃(x))`, the integral is the antiderivative evaluated at the limits of integration.\nV = [ln(F₃(x))] from 0 to 1\nV = ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0))\n\n*A careful point here is to check that F₃(x) is positive over the interval [0, 1] so that ln(F₃(x)) is real.\nFor x in [0, 1], sin(x) is between sin(0)=0 and sin(1)≈0.84.\nSo, e^(sin(x)) > 0.\nThen, 1 + e^(sin(x)) > 1.\nTherefore, F₃(x) = ln(1 + e^(sin(x))) > ln(1) = 0.\nSince F₃(x) is always positive, the expression ln(F₃(x)) is well-defined, and we do not need absolute value bars.*\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the values of F₃(0) and F₃(1)**\n\n*   **Calculate F₃(0):**\n    F₃(0) = ln(1 + e^(sin(0)))\n    Since sin(0) = 0 and e⁰ = 1,\n    F₃(0) = ln(1 + 1) = ln(2)\n\n*   **Calculate F₃(1):**\n    F₃(1) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))\n    Here, '1' is in radians.\n\n**Step 5: Substitute the values back into the expression for V**\n\nV = ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0))\nV = ln(ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))) - ln(ln(2))\n\nUsing the logarithm property ln(a) - ln(b) = ln(a/b), we can write:\nV = ln[ (ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))) / ln(2) ]\n\n**Step 6: Compute the numerical value of V**\n\nWe will use a calculator to find the numerical value. Ensure the calculator is in radian mode.\n*   sin(1) ≈ 0.84147098\n*   e^(sin(1)) ≈ e^0.84147098 ≈ 2.31977045\n*   1 + e^(sin(1)) ≈ 3.31977045\n*   ln(1 + e^(sin(1))) = F₃(1) ≈ ln(3.31977045) ≈ 1.1999553\n*   ln(2) = F₃(0) ≈ 0.6931472\n\nNow, we can calculate V:\nV ≈ ln(1.1999553) - ln(0.6931472)\nV ≈ 0.182283 - (-0.366513)\nV ≈ 0.548796\n\n**Step 7: Calculate the final answer**\n\nThe problem asks for the closest integer to 10000 * V.\n10000 * V ≈ 10000 * 0.548796\n10000 * V ≈ 5487.96\n\nThe closest integer to 5487.96 is 5488.\n\n<<<5488>>>"
