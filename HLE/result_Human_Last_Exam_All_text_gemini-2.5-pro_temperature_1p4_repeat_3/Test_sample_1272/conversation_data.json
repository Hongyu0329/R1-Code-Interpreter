    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the current Vietnamese province where Ming General Mu Sheng experienced his first major defeat.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Historical Context**: The question refers to the period of the Lam Son Uprising (1418–1427), led by the future emperor Lê Lợi against the Ming Dynasty's rule over Vietnam (which the Ming called Jiaozhi). General Mu Sheng (Mộc Thạnh in Vietnamese) was the primary Ming commander tasked with suppressing this rebellion in its early and later stages.\n\n2.  **Define \"First Major Defeat\"**: A \"major defeat\" is distinguished from a minor skirmish or tactical loss. It implies a significant event with strategic consequences, such as the loss of a large force, the loss of a key territory, or a turning point that shifted the momentum of the war. We are looking for the *first* such event under Mu Sheng's overall command.\n\n3.  **Examine the Early Stages of the Uprising (1418-1423)**: During these initial years, Lê Lợi's forces were small and mostly engaged in guerrilla warfare in the mountainous regions of their home base, Lam Sơn, which is in modern-day Thanh Hóa province. While they won some small victories, the Ming army, despite its inability to crush the rebellion, did not suffer a decisive, large-scale defeat. The conflict was largely a stalemate, with Lê Lợi's forces often on the defensive.\n\n4.  **Pinpoint the Strategic Shift in 1424**: The turning point came in 1424 when, on the advice of his general Nguyễn Chích, Lê Lợi changed his strategy. Instead of remaining in the mountains of Thanh Hóa, he decided to move his army south into the fertile and populous plains of Nghệ An, which was less heavily defended by the Ming.\n\n5.  **Identify the Key Battle and Location**: In October 1424, Lê Lợi's forces advanced into Nghệ An. They ambushed and decisively defeated a Ming army at the **Battle of Khả Lưu**. This battle took place at the Khả Lưu Pass in the western part of the province. The Ming forces, under commanders subordinate to Mu Sheng, were routed.\n\n6.  **Assess the Consequence of the Battle**: The victory at Khả Lưu was strategically vital. It shattered the local Ming forces and opened the way for Lê Lợi to besiege and capture the provincial capital, the Citadel of Nghệ An (Thành Nghệ An). The capture of this major administrative center and the subsequent control over the entire province was a massive blow to the Ming occupation. It provided Lê Lợi with a secure, populous base of operations and a huge morale boost.\n\n7.  **Conclusion on \"First Major Defeat\"**: While Mu Sheng was not personally on the battlefield at Khả Lưu, he was the supreme commander of the Ming forces in the region. The loss of an entire province and the defeat of his army there constituted the first major strategic defeat of his campaign against Lê Lợi.\n\n8.  **Map to a Current Vietnamese Province**: The Battle of Khả Lưu and the capture of the provincial citadel all occurred within the territory of what is today **Nghệ An Province**. The Khả Lưu Pass is located in the modern Anh Sơn District of Nghệ An.\n\nTherefore, the current Vietnamese province where Ming General Mu Sheng's command suffered its first major defeat is Nghệ An.\n\n<<<Nghệ An Province>>>"
