    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the observer canonical form and the new matrix C.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Problem and Duality Principle\nThe problem asks to transform a given discrete-time system into its observer canonical form. The method specified is \"using duality\".\n\nThe system is given by:\nx(k+1) = Ax(k)\ny(k) = Cx(k)\n\nWith matrices:\nA = [[1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 1], [0, 2, 0]]\nC = [[0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0]]\n\nThe duality principle connects the observability of a system (A, C) to the controllability of its dual system (A<sup>T</sup>, C<sup>T</sup>). The observer canonical form of (A, C) is dual to the controllable canonical form of (A<sup>T</sup>, C<sup>T</sup>). This means we can find the transformation for one and deduce the other.\n\nA more direct method, which is justified by the duality principle, is to construct the transformation matrix directly from the observability matrix of the original system. Let the transformation be defined by a new state vector `x_o(k) = T * x(k)`. The new system matrices will be:\nA_o = T * A * T<sup>-1</sup>\nC_o = C * T<sup>-1</sup>\n\nThe goal is to find the value of the new matrix C, which we denote as C_o.\n\n### Step 2: Check Observability and Determine Observability Indices\nFirst, we must confirm the system is observable. We construct the observability matrix O:\nO = [C; C*A; C*A<sup>2</sup>; ...]\nThe state dimension is n=3. The output dimension is p=2.\n\nLet the rows of C be c<sub>1</sub> and c<sub>2</sub>:\nc<sub>1</sub> = [0, 1, 0]\nc<sub>2</sub> = [1, 1, 0]\n\nCalculate C*A:\nC*A = [[0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0]] * [[1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 1], [0, 2, 0]] = [[2, 1, 1], [3, 2, 1]]\nThe rows are c<sub>1</sub>A and c<sub>2</sub>A.\n\nThe observability matrix starts with:\nO = [ c<sub>1</sub> ; c<sub>2</sub> ; c<sub>1</sub>A ; c<sub>2</sub>A ; ... ] = [ [0, 1, 0] ; [1, 1, 0] ; [2, 1, 1] ; [3, 2, 1] ; ... ]\n\nTo check for observability, we need to find n=3 linearly independent rows from O. We select them in order:\n1.  **s<sub>1</sub> = c<sub>1</sub> = [0, 1, 0]**. This is a non-zero vector.\n2.  **s<sub>2</sub> = c<sub>2</sub> = [1, 1, 0]**. This is linearly independent from s<sub>1</sub>.\n3.  **s<sub>3</sub> = c<sub>1</sub>A = [2, 1, 1]**. We check if this is linearly independent from {s<sub>1</sub>, s<sub>2</sub>}. We can form a matrix with these three rows and check its determinant:\n    det([[0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 1]]) = 0 - 1 * det([[1, 0], [2, 1]]) + 0 = -1 * (1 - 0) = -1.\n    Since the determinant is non-zero, the three vectors are linearly independent.\n\nThe system is observable. The selected rows {c<sub>1</sub>, c<sub>2</sub>, c<sub>1</sub>A} will form our transformation matrix. The way we picked them also defines the observability indices:\n- For the first output (from c<sub>1</sub>), we used c<sub>1</sub> and c<sub>1</sub>A. So, the index ν<sub>1</sub> = 2.\n- For the second output (from c<sub>2</sub>), we used c<sub>2</sub>. So, the index ν<sub>2</sub> = 1.\n(Check: ν<sub>1</sub> + ν<sub>2</sub> = 2 + 1 = 3 = n).\n\n### Step 3: Construct the Transformation Matrix T\nThe transformation matrix T is constructed by stacking the linearly independent rows we found in the previous step.\nT = [s<sub>1</sub>; s<sub>2</sub>; s<sub>3</sub>] = [c<sub>1</sub>; c<sub>2</sub>; c<sub>1</sub>A]\nT = [[0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 1]]\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Inverse of the Transformation Matrix, T<sup>-1</sup>\nTo find C_o = C * T<sup>-1</sup>, we first need to compute T<sup>-1</sup>. We can use the method of Gaussian elimination on the augmented matrix [T | I].\n[T | I] = [[0, 1, 0 | 1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 0 | 0, 1, 0], [2, 1, 1 | 0, 0, 1]]\n\n1.  Swap Row 1 and Row 2:\n    [[1, 1, 0 | 0, 1, 0], [0, 1, 0 | 1, 0, 0], [2, 1, 1 | 0, 0, 1]]\n2.  R3 -> R3 - 2*R1:\n    [[1, 1, 0 | 0, 1, 0], [0, 1, 0 | 1, 0, 0], [0, -1, 1 | 0, -2, 1]]\n3.  R1 -> R1 - R2:\n    [[1, 0, 0 | -1, 1, 0], [0, 1, 0 | 1, 0, 0], [0, -1, 1 | 0, -2, 1]]\n4.  R3 -> R3 + R2:\n    [[1, 0, 0 | -1, 1, 0], [0, 1, 0 | 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1 | 1, -2, 1]]\n\nThe inverse matrix is:\nT<sup>-1</sup> = [[-1, 1, 0], [1, 0, 0], [1, -2, 1]]\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the New Matrix C_o\nNow we compute the new output matrix C_o using the formula C_o = C * T<sup>-1</sup>.\nC = [[0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0]]\nT<sup>-1</sup> = [[-1, 1, 0], [1, 0, 0], [1, -2, 1]]\n\nC_o = [[0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0]] * [[-1, 1, 0], [1, 0, 0], [1, -2, 1]]\n\nFirst row of C_o:\n[ (0)*(-1) + (1)*(1) + (0)*(1),  (0)*(1) + (1)*(0) + (0)*(-2),  (0)*(0) + (1)*(0) + (0)*(1) ] = [1, 0, 0]\n\nSecond row of C_o:\n[ (1)*(-1) + (1)*(1) + (0)*(1),  (1)*(1) + (1)*(0) + (0)*(-2),  (1)*(0) + (1)*(0) + (0)*(1) ] = [0, 1, 0]\n\nSo, the resulting new matrix C is:\nC_o = [[1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0]]\n\nThis is a valid observer canonical form where the output `y(k)` is directly given by the first `p` states of the new state vector `x_o(k)`."
