    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rarest noble gas on Earth.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Noble Gases**\nThe noble gases are the elements in Group 18 of the periodic table. In order of increasing atomic number, they are:\n*   Helium (He)\n*   Neon (Ne)\n*   Argon (Ar)\n*   Krypton (Kr)\n*   Xenon (Xe)\n*   Radon (Rn)\n*   Oganesson (Og)\n\n**Step 2: Define the Scope of the Question**\n*   **Substance:** Noble gases.\n*   **Location:** \"On Earth as a percentage of all terrestrial matter.\" This includes the atmosphere, oceans, crust, mantle, and core.\n*   **Timeframe:** \"as of 2002.\" The relative abundance of elements on Earth does not change significantly over human timescales, so data from around that period or current data is valid.\n*   **Exclusion:** Oganesson (Og) is a synthetic element that does not occur naturally on Earth and must be excluded from consideration.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Abundance of Each Noble Gas**\nNoble gases are chemically inert and volatile. For this reason, their concentration is highest in the Earth's atmosphere, and extremely low within the Earth's crust and mantle. Therefore, the atmospheric concentration is a very good proxy for their overall relative abundance.\n\nLet's examine the atmospheric abundance of each stable noble gas by volume:\n*   **Argon (Ar):** ~0.934% or 9,340 parts per million (ppm). It is the third most abundant gas in our atmosphere.\n*   **Neon (Ne):** ~18.2 ppm.\n*   **Helium (He):** ~5.2 ppm.\n*   **Krypton (Kr):** ~1.1 ppm.\n*   **Xenon (Xe):** ~0.09 ppm (or 90 parts per billion).\n\nBased on this data for stable gases, Xenon is the rarest. However, we must also consider Radon.\n\n**Step 4: The Special Case of Radon (Rn)**\nRadon is different from the other noble gases listed because it is radioactive.\n*   **Origin:** Radon is not a primordial element from the Earth's formation. It is continuously generated from the radioactive decay of radium, which in turn comes from the decay of uranium and thorium in the Earth's crust.\n*   **Instability:** Radon itself is highly unstable. Its most stable isotope, Radon-222, has a half-life of only 3.8 days.\n*   **Accumulation:** Because it decays so quickly, Radon cannot accumulate in the atmosphere or crust to any significant degree. It exists in a state of temporary equilibrium where its rate of decay is matched by its rate of production.\n*   **Resulting Rarity:** The total amount of Radon in the entire Earth's atmosphere at any given moment is estimated to be only a few tens of kilograms. In contrast, the mass of Xenon in the atmosphere is trillions of kilograms. This makes Radon many orders of magnitude rarer than Xenon.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n1.  **Terrestrial Matter vs. Atmosphere:** While the question asks about all terrestrial matter, the extreme rarity of noble gases in the solid Earth means their atmospheric ranking is a reliable guide to their overall ranking.\n2.  **Radioactivity is Key:** The deciding factor is Radon's radioactivity and extremely short half-life, which prevents it from ever building up in concentration.\n3.  **Stable vs. Unstable:** The comparison comes down to the rarest *stable* noble gas (Xenon) versus the rarest overall noble gas (Radon). The question does not specify \"stable,\" so Radon must be included.\n4.  **The Year 2002:** This detail is not critical as these fundamental abundances have not changed.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nComparing all the natural noble gases on Earth, Radon is by far the rarest. Its concentration is so low due to its short radioactive half-life that it is only present in minuscule, transient amounts.\n\n<<<Radon>>>"
