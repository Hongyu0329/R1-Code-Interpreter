The density profile \(\rho(z)\) is implicitly defined by the system of differential equations governing the local chemical potential of each gas species in the gravitational field, incorporating the van der Waals interactions. Specifically, \(\rho(z) = M_A n_A(z) + M_B n_B(z)\), where \(n_A(z)\) and \(n_B(z)\) are solutions to the coupled system \(\frac{d}{dz}\mu_i^{int}(n_A(z), n_B(z)) = -M_i g\) for \(i=A,B\), with \(\mu_i^{int}\) being the chemical potential for a van der Waals mixture and with boundary conditions set by the total number of particles. A closed-form analytical solution is not available.
