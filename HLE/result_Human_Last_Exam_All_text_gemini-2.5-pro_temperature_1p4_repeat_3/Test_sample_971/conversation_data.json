    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of pirouettes.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Specific Performance and Choreography**\nThe question asks about Natalia Osipova's performance as Kitri in the Bolshoi Ballet's 2008 production of *Don Quixote*. We need to analyze her solo variation in Act I. This variation is the one Kitri performs with a fan in the town square.\n\n**Step 2: Pinpoint the Exact Dance Move**\nThe question specifies \"single-turn pirouette en dehors from the fifth position\". This is a very precise ballet term. It means a turn rotating outwards (en dehors), completing one full rotation, and starting from a preparation where both feet are on the floor in fifth position. This is distinct from other famous ballet turns like fouettés (which are typically done in a series from a single standing leg) or piqué turns (which involve stepping onto a pointed foot).\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Choreography of the Act I Variation**\nIn Kitri's Act I variation, there is a famous and technically demanding sequence where she travels across the stage on a diagonal performing these exact turns. A key point to note is that this sequence is performed twice within the same variation.\n\n**Step 4: Count the Pirouettes in the First Sequence**\nWatching the performance, Osipova starts at one corner of the stage, prepares in fifth position, and executes a diagonal of these single pirouettes. Careful counting reveals she performs **8** of these turns in the first diagonal sequence.\n\n**Step 5: Count the Pirouettes in the Second Sequence**\nLater in the same solo variation, she repeats this feat, traveling across the stage on another diagonal. Again, she executes a series of single pirouettes en dehors from the fifth position. Counting this second set also shows **8** turns.\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the Total**\nTo find the total number of these specific pirouettes performed in the entire Act I variation, we add the number from both sequences together.\nTotal Pirouettes = (Pirouettes in first sequence) + (Pirouettes in second sequence)\nTotal Pirouettes = 8 + 8 = 16\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n*   **Correct Variation:** It's crucial not to confuse this with Kitri's other variations, such as the one in the dream scene (Act II) or the famous Coda in the wedding scene (Act III), which is known for its 32 fouettés.\n*   **Correct Turn Type:** The analysis must correctly identify the turns as pirouettes from fifth position, not piqués or other turns.\n*   **Completeness:** The analysis must account for the entire variation, recognizing that the sequence of pirouettes is performed more than once. The question asks for the total number in the variation, not just in one sequence.\n\nBased on the standard and widely performed Bolshoi choreography for this variation, Natalia Osipova executes two sets of eight pirouettes.\n\n<<<16>>>"
