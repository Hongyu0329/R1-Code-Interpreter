    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the number of ways to place 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Board and Attacks\n\n*   **Board:** A 5x5 grid, where coordinates `(x, y)` can be represented by `x, y ∈ {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}`.\n*   **Toroidal:** The board wraps around. This means all arithmetic for coordinates is performed modulo 5.\n*   **Queen Attacks:** A queen at `(x, y)` attacks any square `(x', y')` if they share a row, column, or diagonal. On a toroidal board, this translates to:\n    1.  **Row attack:** `y' = y`\n    2.  **Column attack:** `x' = x`\n    3.  **Main diagonal family attack:** `x' - y' ≡ x - y (mod 5)`\n    4.  **Anti-diagonal family attack:** `x' + y' ≡ x + y (mod 5)`\n\n### Step 2: Defining a Valid Placement of 4 Queens\n\nWe need to find the number of ways to choose 4 squares, let's say `{(x₁, y₁), (x₂, y₂), (x₃, y₃), (x₄, y₄)}`, such that no two squares attack each other. Based on the attack rules, this means the following four sets of numbers must each contain 4 distinct elements:\n1.  The set of column indices: `{x₁, x₂, x₃, x₄}`\n2.  The set of row indices: `{y₁, y₂, y₃, y₄}`\n3.  The set of main diagonal indices: `{(x₁-y₁) mod 5, (x₂-y₂) mod 5, (x₃-y₃) mod 5, (x₄-y₄) mod 5}`\n4.  The set of anti-diagonal indices: `{(x₁+y₁) mod 5, (x₂+y₂) mod 5, (x₃+y₃) mod 5, (x₄+y₄) mod 5}`\n\n*Careful Point:* The problem asks for the number of ways to place the queens, which typically implies the queens are indistinguishable. We are counting sets of 4 squares.\n\n### Step 3: Connecting the 4-Queen Problem to the 5-Queen Problem\n\nSolving this by direct enumeration (checking all `C(25, 4)` combinations) is infeasible. A more elegant method is to relate this `(n-1)`-queen problem to the `n`-queen problem on the same `n x n` board (here, n=5).\n\nLet's first consider the problem of placing **5 non-attacking queens** on the 5x5 toroidal board. A valid placement of 5 queens would be a set of 5 squares `{(x₀,y₀), ..., (x₄,y₄)}` such that:\n*   The set of x-coordinates `{x₀, ..., x₄}` is `{0, 1, 2, 3, 4}`.\n*   The set of y-coordinates `{y₀, ..., y₄}` is `{0, 1, 2, 3, 4}`.\n*   The set of main diagonal indices `{(xᵢ-yᵢ) mod 5}` is `{0, 1, 2, 3, 4}`.\n*   The set of anti-diagonal indices `{(xᵢ+yᵢ) mod 5}` is `{0, 1, 2, 3, 4}`.\n\n### Step 4: Counting the Number of 5-Queen Solutions\n\nSolutions to the n-queens problem on a toroidal board are well-studied. For `n=5` (a prime number), all solutions are \"affine solutions\". These are sets of points `(x, y)` that satisfy a linear equation `y ≡ ax + b (mod 5)`.\n\nFor such a linear arrangement to be a valid 5-queen solution, the coefficients `a` and `b` must satisfy certain conditions:\n*   `a` must be a unit modulo 5 (i.e., `a ≠ 0`) for the mapping to be a permutation of rows.\n*   To ensure the main diagonals are all distinct, the function `d(x) = x - y = x - (ax+b) = (1-a)x - b` must be a permutation. This requires `1-a` to be a unit (i.e., `1-a ≠ 0`, so `a ≠ 1`).\n*   To ensure the anti-diagonals are all distinct, the function `s(x) = x + y = x + (ax+b) = (1+a)x + b` must be a permutation. This requires `1+a` to be a unit (i.e., `1+a ≠ 0`, so `a ≠ -1 ≡ 4 mod 5`).\n\nThe possible values for `a` in `{0, 1, 2, 3, 4}` are therefore restricted to `{2, 3}`.\nThe value of `b` can be any element in `{0, 1, 2, 3, 4}`.\n\n*   Number of choices for `a`: 2 (either 2 or 3)\n*   Number of choices for `b`: 5 (from 0 to 4)\n\nTotal number of 5-queen solutions = `2 × 5 = 10`.\n\n### Step 5: Establishing the Link Between 4-Queen and 5-Queen Solutions\n\nThere is a direct relationship between the solutions for 4 queens and 5 queens.\n\n1.  **From 5 Queens to 4 Queens:**\n    Take any valid 5-queen solution. This is a set of 5 non-attacking queens. If we remove any one of these 5 queens, the remaining 4 queens cannot attack each other (since they didn't attack each other when the 5th queen was present). Thus, from each 5-queen solution, we can generate `C(5, 4) = 5` valid 4-queen solutions.\n    Since the 10 solutions for 5 queens are distinct lines, any 4-queen configuration derived from one line cannot be the same as a configuration derived from another (as 4 points uniquely define at most one such line). This gives us `10 × 5 = 50` distinct 4-queen configurations.\n\n2.  **From 4 Queens to 5 Queens (The \"Completion\" Argument):**\n    The crucial insight is that *every* valid 4-queen solution can be uniquely extended to a valid 5-queen solution.\n    Let `S₄ = {(x₁, y₁), (x₂, y₂), (x₃, y₃), (x₄, y₄)}` be a valid 4-queen solution.\n    *   There is exactly one missing column index, `x₅`.\n    *   There is exactly one missing row index, `y₅`.\n    *   There is exactly one missing main diagonal index, `d₅`.\n    *   There is exactly one missing anti-diagonal index, `s₅`.\n\n    We can prove that the queen placed on the empty square `(x₅, y₅)` completes the set. Let's check its diagonals.\n    In `Z₅ = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}`, the sum of all elements is `0+1+2+3+4 = 10 ≡ 0 (mod 5)`.\n    So, `x₁+...+x₄ ≡ -x₅ (mod 5)` and `y₁+...+y₄ ≡ -y₅ (mod 5)`.\n    The sum of the main diagonal indices is `(x₁-y₁) + ... + (x₄-y₄) ≡ -d₅ (mod 5)`.\n    Also, `(x₁+...+x₄) - (y₁+...+y₄) ≡ (-x₅) - (-y₅) = y₅ - x₅ (mod 5)`.\n    So, `-d₅ ≡ y₅ - x₅`, which means `d₅ ≡ x₅ - y₅ (mod 5)`. The new queen `(x₅, y₅)` has the correct missing main diagonal index.\n    Similarly, for the anti-diagonals, `s₅ ≡ x₅ + y₅ (mod 5)`. The new queen also has the correct missing anti-diagonal index.\n    This proves that adding the queen at `(x₅, y₅)` completes the 4-queen solution to a valid 5-queen solution.\n\n### Step 6: Final Calculation\n\n*   There are exactly 10 solutions for placing 5 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal board.\n*   Each 5-queen solution can be used to generate 5 distinct 4-queen solutions by removing one queen at a time.\n*   Every 4-queen solution can be uniquely \"completed\" back to exactly one 5-queen solution.\n\nThis establishes a 5-to-1 correspondence between the set of 4-queen solutions and the set of 5-queen solutions.\nTherefore, the total number of ways to place 4 non-attacking queens is:\n(Number of 5-queen solutions) × 5 = `10 × 5 = 50`."
