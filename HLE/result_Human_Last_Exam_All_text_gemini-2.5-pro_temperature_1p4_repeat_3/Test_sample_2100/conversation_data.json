    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the first clue.**\n*   The man is called \"a joy-discovering sailor\" by Andrei Voznesensky.\n*   **Careful Point:** Andrei Voznesensky was a famous Russian poet. This strongly suggests the man in question is a figure from Russian history or culture. The phrase \"joy-discovering sailor\" points to an explorer or navigator whose work was seen as positive and wondrous.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the second clue.**\n*   Voznesensky wrote a poem wondering, \"Where is your grave, even a mound?\"\n*   **Careful Point:** This is a crucial piece of information. It means that for a very long time, the location of this man's grave was unknown or lost.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the source of the quotes.**\n*   The quotes are from Voznesensky's libretto for the famous Russian rock opera \"Juno and Avos\" («Юнона и Авось»).\n*   **Careful Point:** Knowing the source allows us to identify the subject. The opera is about the tragic love story of the Russian explorer Nikolai Rezanov and Concepción \"Conchita\" Argüello. Rezanov is the central male character.\n\n**Step 4: Connect the subject to the clues.**\n*   Nikolai Rezanov was a Russian nobleman, diplomat, and one of the founders of the Russian-American Company. He sailed to Russian America (Alaska) and then to California. This fits the description of a \"sailor\" or explorer.\n*   On his return journey across Siberia in 1807, Rezanov fell ill and died in the city of Krasnoyarsk. He was buried there, but the cathedral and cemetery where he was laid to rest were destroyed by the Soviet authorities in the 20th century, and the exact location of his grave was lost. This directly corresponds to the line, \"Where is your grave...?\"\n\n**Step 5: Analyze the final clue.**\n*   \"The answer to this question emerged in the late 1980s.\"\n*   **Careful Point:** This provides a specific timeframe for the rediscovery. During the period of Glasnost in the late 1980s, there was a revival of interest in pre-revolutionary Russian history. Fueled by the immense popularity of the rock opera, researchers in Krasnoyarsk were able to identify the probable site of Rezanov's grave at a location that is now a public square. This discovery was widely publicized at the time.\n\n**Step 6: Synthesize all information to find the final answer.**\n*   The man is the protagonist of Voznesensky's \"Juno and Avos\".\n*   He was an explorer whose grave was lost.\n*   The site of his grave was rediscovered in the late 1980s.\n*   All these facts point to Nikolai Rezanov.\n*   The question asks for his last name.\n\nThe last name is Rezanov.\n\n<<<Rezanov>>>"
