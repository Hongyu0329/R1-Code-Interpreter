    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which flags of African nations have the same linear algebraic rank as the flag of Denmark.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Flag of Denmark and Determine its Rank\n\n1.  **Flag Description:** The flag of Denmark features a white Nordic cross on a red field. The cross extends to the edges of the flag.\n2.  **Matrix Representation:** To analyze the flag using linear algebra, we represent it as a matrix. We assign distinct numerical values to the different colors to maximize the rank. Let's assign Red=1 and White=2.\n3.  **Identify Row Types:** A matrix representing the Danish flag will have two distinct types of rows:\n    *   **Type A:** Rows that are part of the horizontal bar of the white cross. These rows consist entirely of the value for White. For example, `[2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]`.\n    *   **Type B:** Rows that are not part of the horizontal bar. These rows are mostly Red but are intersected by the vertical bar of the white cross. For example, `[1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1]`.\n4.  **Calculate the Rank:** The rank of a matrix is the maximum number of linearly independent rows.\n    *   Let `r_A = [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]` and `r_B = [1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1]`.\n    *   These two vectors are linearly independent. `r_A` is not a scalar multiple of `r_B` because the ratio of corresponding elements is not constant (e.g., `2/1` for the first element vs. `2/2` for the fourth element).\n    *   Since all rows in the flag matrix are either Type A or Type B, the entire row space is spanned by these two vectors.\n    *   Therefore, the maximal rank of the Danish flag is **2**.\n\n### Step 2: Establish Criteria for African Flags with Rank 2\n\nWe are looking for African national flags whose matrix representation also has a maximal rank of 2. This means the flag's design must result in exactly two linearly independent row (or column) types.\n\n*   **Rank 1 Flags:** These designs have only one type of row/column vector (up to scalar multiplication).\n    *   Examples: Flags with only horizontal stripes (e.g., Gabon, Mauritius) or only vertical stripes (e.g., Mali, Côte d'Ivoire). In a horizontal tricolor like Gabon's, the rows are `[G,G,G]`, `[Y,Y,Y]`, `[B,B,B]`. If we assign `G=1, Y=2, B=3`, the rows are `1*[1,1,1]`, `2*[1,1,1]`, and `3*[1,1,1]`. They are all multiples of `[1,1,1]`, so the row space is 1-dimensional.\n\n*   **Rank ≥ 3 Flags:** These designs are more complex, introducing three or more linearly independent row/column types.\n    *   Examples: Flags with diagonal stripes (e.g., Tanzania, Namibia), complex emblems that cross over multiple color bands (e.g., Burkina Faso, South Africa), or cantons on a multi-striped field (e.g., Togo, Liberia).\n\n*   **Rank 2 Flags:** These designs have a simple base pattern (like a monocolor field or simple stripes) that is modified in a way that introduces exactly one new linearly independent row/column type. Common patterns include:\n    1.  **A plain field with a simple emblem:** The two row types are the plain field row and the row intersected by the emblem.\n    2.  **A striped flag with a simple emblem contained entirely within one stripe:** The two vector types are the generic striped row/column vector and the vector representing the stripe containing the emblem.\n    3.  **A \"split\" design:** A vertical band at the hoist with two horizontal stripes on the fly (e.g., Benin's design). This creates two distinct row types.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze African Flags Based on the Criteria\n\nWe will now screen the flags of African nations to find those with designs that result in a rank of 2.\n\n1.  **Benin:** The flag has a vertical green band at the hoist and two horizontal bands (yellow and red) on the fly.\n    *   Top rows: `[Green, Green, ..., Yellow, Yellow, ...]`\n    *   Bottom rows: `[Green, Green, ..., Red, Red, ...]`\n    *   These two row types are linearly independent. **Rank = 2**.\n\n2.  **Madagascar:** The flag has a vertical white band at the hoist and two horizontal bands (red and green) on the fly.\n    *   This has the same structure as Benin's flag. **Rank = 2**.\n\n3.  **Somalia:** The flag has a plain light blue field with a single white five-pointed star in the center.\n    *   Row types: (1) All blue rows. (2) Rows that are blue but are intersected by the white star.\n    *   These two row types are linearly independent. **Rank = 2**.\n\n4.  **Ghana:** The flag is a horizontal tricolor (red, yellow, green) with a black star in the center of the yellow stripe.\n    *   The basic tricolor has Rank 1. The black star is fully contained in the yellow stripe, introducing a second linearly independent row type (`[Yellow, ..., Black, ..., Yellow]`).\n    *   **Rank = 2**.\n\n5.  **Senegal:** The flag is a vertical tricolor (green, yellow, red) with a green star in the center of the yellow stripe.\n    *   Similar to Ghana, but with vertical stripes. The star introduces a second linearly independent column type. **Rank = 2**.\n\n6.  **Niger:** The flag is a horizontal tricolor (orange, white, green) with an orange roundel (circle) in the center of the white stripe.\n    *   The roundel in the middle stripe introduces a second linearly independent row type. **Rank = 2**.\n\n7.  **Rwanda:** The flag has a large light blue top stripe, a middle yellow stripe, and a bottom green stripe. There is a yellow sun in the top-right corner, fully within the blue stripe.\n    *   The sun in the top stripe introduces a second linearly independent row type. **Rank = 2**.\n\n8.  **Egypt:** The flag is a horizontal tricolor (red, white, black) with the Eagle of Saladin centered on the white stripe.\n    *   The eagle on the middle stripe introduces a second linearly independent row type. **Rank = 2**.\n\n9.  **Lesotho:** The flag is a horizontal tricolor (blue, white, green) with a black mokorotlo (hat) centered on the white stripe.\n    *   The hat on the middle stripe introduces a second linearly independent row type. **Rank = 2**.\n\n10. **Malawi:** The flag is a horizontal tricolor (black, red, green) with a red rising sun emblem centered on the top black stripe.\n    *   The sun emblem on the top stripe introduces a second linearly independent row type. **Rank = 2**.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the following ten African nations have flags with a maximal linear algebraic rank of 2, the same as the flag of Denmark:\n\n*   Benin\n*   Egypt\n*   Ghana\n*   Lesotho\n*   Madagascar\n*   Malawi\n*   Niger\n*   Rwanda\n*   Senegal\n*   Somalia\n\n<<<Benin, Egypt, Ghana, Lesotho, Madagascar, Malawi, Niger, Rwanda, Senegal, Somalia>>>"
