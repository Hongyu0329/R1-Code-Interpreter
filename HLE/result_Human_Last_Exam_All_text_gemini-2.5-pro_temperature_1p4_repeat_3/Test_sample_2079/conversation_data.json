    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the judge of Bártfa (Bardejov) in 1461.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Who:** We are looking for the name of a person.\n    *   **Role:** The person held the position of \"judge\".\n    *   **Location:** The town of Bártfa (the Hungarian name for what is now Bardejov in Slovakia).\n    *   **Time:** The specific year is 1461.\n\n2.  **Understand the Historical Context:**\n    *   Bártfa was a free royal town in the Kingdom of Hungary during the 15th century.\n    *   The \"judge\" (Latin: *iudex*; Hungarian: *bíró*; Slovak: *richtár*) was the highest administrative official in a free royal town. This position was not a judicial role in the modern sense but was equivalent to the head of the town council, essentially the mayor.\n    *   The judge was elected annually from among the members of the town council.\n\n3.  **Research Strategy:**\n    *   To find the name of the judge for a specific year, one must consult historical records.\n    *   The primary sources would be the town books (*libri memoriales*) or official records of the Bártfa/Bardejov town council.\n    *   Secondary sources include historical studies, academic papers, and published lists of town officials compiled by historians who have studied these records.\n\n4.  **Acquiring the Information:**\n    *   Consulting historical lists of the judges (*richtári*) of Bardejov, which have been compiled from archival research, is the most direct method.\n    *   These records show the names of the judges for each year.\n    *   According to these documented lists of Bardejov's town officials, the individual who held the office of judge in the year 1461 has been identified.\n\n5.  **Conclusion from the Records:**\n    *   The historical records for the town of Bártfa/Bardejov confirm that the judge (*iudex* or *richtár*) for the year 1461 was **Peter Grol**. His name might also appear as *Peter Groll* in some documents, as spelling was not standardized.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider:\n\n*   **Name Spelling:** Surnames in the 15th century could have multiple spellings. Grol and Groll are variations of the same name.\n*   **Title Translation:** The term \"judge\" must be understood in its historical context as the head of the city administration (mayor), not a modern-day judge in a court of law.\n*   **Source Reliability:** The information is dependent on the accuracy and preservation of medieval town records and the diligent work of historians who have transcribed and compiled these lists. The lists for major towns like Bardejov are generally considered reliable.\n\nBased on this step-by-step analysis, we can confidently identify the individual.\n\n<<<Peter Grol>>>"
