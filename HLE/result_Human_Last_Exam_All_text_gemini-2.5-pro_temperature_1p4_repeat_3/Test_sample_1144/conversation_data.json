    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Goal\nThe objective is to find the ratio of the uncertainty in the momentum of an electron ($\\Delta p$) to its actual momentum ($p$) in the first Bohr orbit. This can be expressed as the ratio $\\frac{\\Delta p}{p}$.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Uncertainty in Momentum ($\\Delta p$)\nThis part of the problem involves Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle.\n\n*   **Principle:** The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle states that the product of the uncertainty in a particle's position ($\\Delta x$) and the uncertainty in its momentum ($\\Delta p$) must be greater than or equal to a constant value. The principle is formally written as:\n    $\\Delta x \\cdot \\Delta p \\geq \\frac{\\hbar}{2}$\n    where $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant ($\\hbar = \\frac{h}{2\\pi} \\approx 1.054 \\times 10^{-34} \\text{ J s}$).\n\n*   **Given Information:** The uncertainty in the electron's position is given as $\\Delta x = 10 \\text{ pm}$.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Unit Conversion.** All calculations should be in SI units. We must convert picometers (pm) to meters (m).\n    $\\Delta x = 10 \\text{ pm} = 10 \\times 10^{-12} \\text{ m} = 1 \\times 10^{-11} \\text{ m}$.\n\n*   **Calculation:** To find the minimum uncertainty in momentum, we use the equality from the principle:\n    $\\Delta p = \\frac{\\hbar}{2 \\Delta x}$\n    $\\Delta p = \\frac{1.054 \\times 10^{-34} \\text{ J s}}{2 \\times (1 \\times 10^{-11} \\text{ m})}$\n    $\\Delta p = \\frac{1.054 \\times 10^{-34}}{2 \\times 10^{-11}} \\text{ kg m/s}$\n    $\\Delta p = 5.27 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{ kg m/s}$.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Momentum ($p$) in the First Bohr Orbit\nThis part of the problem involves the Bohr model of the hydrogen atom.\n\n*   **Principle:** According to Bohr's model, the angular momentum ($L$) of an electron in an allowed orbit is quantized. It is an integer multiple of the reduced Planck constant $\\hbar$.\n    $L = n\\hbar$\n    where $n$ is the principal quantum number (n=1 for the first orbit).\n\n*   **Relation to Linear Momentum:** Angular momentum is also defined as $L = p \\cdot r$, where $p$ is the linear momentum and $r$ is the orbital radius.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Identify the Correct Orbit.** The problem specifies the **first Bohr orbit**, so we must use $n=1$.\n\n*   **Calculation:** For the first Bohr orbit ($n=1$):\n    $L_1 = 1 \\cdot \\hbar = \\hbar$\n    Since $L_1 = p_1 \\cdot r_1$, we have $p_1 \\cdot r_1 = \\hbar$.\n    Therefore, the momentum is $p_1 = \\frac{\\hbar}{r_1}$.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Use the Correct Radius.** The radius of the first Bohr orbit ($r_1$) is a fundamental constant known as the Bohr radius ($a_0$).\n    $r_1 = a_0 \\approx 5.29 \\times 10^{-11} \\text{ m}$.\n\n*   **Calculation of Momentum:**\n    $p_1 = \\frac{1.054 \\times 10^{-34} \\text{ J s}}{5.29 \\times 10^{-11} \\text{ m}}$\n    $p_1 \\approx 1.99 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{ kg m/s}$.\n\n### Step 4: Find the Final Ratio\nNow we can compute the required ratio using the values calculated in the previous steps.\n\n*   **Ratio:** $\\frac{\\Delta p}{p}$\n*   **Substitution:**\n    Ratio = $\\frac{5.27 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{ kg m/s}}{1.99 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{ kg m/s}}$\n\n*   **Final Calculation:**\n    Ratio $\\approx 2.648$\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the ratio is 2.65.\n\n### Summary of Careful Points\n1.  **Unit Consistency:** Convert all given values to SI units (pm to m).\n2.  **Correct Principles:** Use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for uncertainty ($\\Delta p$) and the Bohr model quantization rules for the actual momentum ($p$).\n3.  **Correct Constants:** Use the standard values for $\\hbar$ and the Bohr radius $a_0$.\n4.  **Correct Orbit:** Ensure calculations for momentum are for the specified first orbit ($n=1$).\n\n<<<2.65>>>"
