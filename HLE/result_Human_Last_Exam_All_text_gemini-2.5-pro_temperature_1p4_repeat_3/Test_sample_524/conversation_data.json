    "This is a deep question in point-set topology. To answer it, we must rely on a famous classification theorem that was the result of decades of research by many topologists.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the definitions**\n\n*   **Continuum:** A compact, connected metric space. In the plane (R²), this means a closed, bounded, and connected set.\n*   **Planar:** A space that can be embedded in the plane R². This means there is a homeomorphism from the space onto a subset of R².\n*   **Homogeneous:** A space X is homogeneous if for any two points x and y in X, there exists a homeomorphism h: X → X (a self-homeomorphism) such that h(x) = y. This intuitively means the space \"looks the same\" at every point.\n*   **Homeomorphism Class:** We are counting the number of topologically distinct types of these spaces. Two spaces are in the same class if they are homeomorphic.\n\n**Step 2: Divide the problem into cases**\n\nA key property of a planar continuum is whether or not it separates the plane. That is, if K is the continuum in R², does R² \\ K have one connected component (non-separating) or more than one (separating)? The classification of homogeneous planar continua is based on this division.\n\n**Case 1: The continuum separates the plane.**\n\n*   **Careful Point:** The Jordan Curve Theorem states that any simple closed curve separates the plane into two components (an \"inside\" and an \"outside\").\n*   **Key Theorem:** A famous and powerful theorem by R. H. Bing (1960) states that **the only homogeneous planar continuum that separates the plane is a simple closed curve.**\n*   **Analysis:** All simple closed curves are homeomorphic to the circle (S¹). Therefore, there is exactly one homeomorphism class of homogeneous planar continua that separate the plane.\n*   **Result for Case 1:** The **Circle**. (1 class)\n\n**Case 2: The continuum does not separate the plane.**\n\nThis case is significantly more complex and its resolution took much longer.\n\n*   **Trivial Example:** The simplest non-separating continuum is a **single point**. It is compact, connected, planar, and trivially homogeneous. It forms its own homeomorphism class.\n*   **Key Theorem (Bing, 1951):** R. H. Bing proved that any non-separating homogeneous planar continuum must be indecomposable (meaning it cannot be written as the union of two of its proper subcontinua).\n*   **Candidate 1: The Pseudo-arc.** The pseudo-arc is a classic example of an indecomposable, \"snake-like\" continuum.\n    *   **Careful Point:** It is planar and non-separating.\n    *   **Key Theorem:** Bing proved in 1948 that the pseudo-arc is homogeneous. It is topologically distinct from the point and the circle. So, this is another class.\n*   **Candidate 2: The Pseudo-circle.** The pseudo-circle is another type of indecomposable continuum, but unlike the \"chainable\" pseudo-arc, it is \"circle-like\" but not a simple closed curve.\n    *   **Careful Point:** It is planar and non-separating.\n    *   **Key Fact:** For a very long time, it was a major open problem whether the pseudo-circle was homogeneous. This question was finally answered in the affirmative by J. Prajs and K. Whittington in 2008. The pseudo-circle is indeed homogeneous. It is also topologically distinct from the point, circle, and pseudo-arc.\n*   **Completeness of the List:** Are there any others? Decades of work by topologists such as Bing, Moise, Jones, Rogers, Hagopian, and Tymchatyn have shown that the list of non-separating homogeneous planar continua is complete with these three examples.\n\n*   **Result for Case 2:**\n    1.  The **Point**\n    2.  The **Pseudo-arc**\n    3.  The **Pseudo-circle**\n    (3 classes)\n\n**Step 3: Combine the results**\n\nWe have found all the distinct homeomorphism classes by considering the two possible cases (separating and non-separating).\n\n*   From the separating case, we get 1 class: The Circle.\n*   From the non-separating case, we get 3 classes: The Point, The Pseudo-arc, and The Pseudo-circle.\n\nAll four of these are topologically distinct from one another.\n\nTherefore, the total number of homeomorphism classes of homogeneous planar continua is 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThere are exactly four such homeomorphism classes. They are:\n1.  The Point\n2.  The Circle\n3.  The Pseudo-arc\n4.  The Pseudo-circle\n\n<<<4>>>"
