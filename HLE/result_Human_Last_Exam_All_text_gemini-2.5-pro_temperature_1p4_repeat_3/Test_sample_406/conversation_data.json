    "An FGH-tripled fixed point refers to a point `(x, y, z)` that remains unchanged after the application of a system of three functions, F, G, and H, in a specific manner. The conditions for the existence of such a point are typically established using fixed-point theorems, most commonly the Banach Contraction Principle, which requires a specific structure on the underlying spaces and properties of the functions.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Question\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Concept:** The question asks for the conditions for the existence of an \"FGH-tripled fixed point\". This is an extension of the standard fixed point concept (`f(x) = x`) to a system of three variables (`x, y, z`) and three functions (`F, G, H`).\n\n2.  **Define the Functions and Variables:**\n    *   We have three non-empty sets, `X`, `Y`, and `Z`.\n    *   We have three functions with the following domains and codomains:\n        *   `F: X × Y × Z → X`\n        *   `G: Y × X × Z → Y`\n        *   `H: Z × Y × X → Z`\n    *   An FGH-tripled fixed point is a triplet `(x, y, z)` with `x ∈ X`, `y ∈ Y`, `z ∈ Z`.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Fixed-Point Equations:** The \"fixed point\" condition means the output of each function is equal to the corresponding input variable. Based on the function signatures and conventions in coupled and tripled fixed point theory, the system of equations is:\n    *   `F(x, y, z) = x`\n    *   `G(y, x, z) = y`\n    *   `H(z, y, x) = z`\n\n4.  **Determine the Mathematical Framework:** To guarantee the existence of a solution to this system, we need a mathematical theorem. The Banach Contraction Principle is the ideal tool. This requires defining metric spaces and a contraction mapping.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Interpretation of Function Signatures:** The prompt contains `G:Y*X*Y→Y` and a second `G:Z*Y*X→Z`. We assume these are typos for the more standard and symmetric definitions in this field: `G: Y×X×Z→Y` and `H: Z×Y×X→Z`. This interpretation preserves the permutation of variables `(x, y, z)` common in such problems.\n\n2.  **Structure of the Spaces:** The sets `X`, `Y`, and `Z` cannot be arbitrary. For the Banach principle to apply, they must be **complete metric spaces**. Let their respective metrics be `d_X`, `d_Y`, and `d_Z`.\n\n3.  **Properties of the Functions:** The functions `F`, `G`, and `H` cannot be arbitrary. They must collectively satisfy a **contraction-type condition** to ensure that iterating them leads to a convergent sequence.\n\n4.  **Choice of Metric for the Product Space:** The analysis requires combining the three spaces into a single product space `W = X × Y × Z`. We must define a metric on `W`, such as the sum metric `d_W((x1, y1, z1), (x2, y2, z2)) = d_X(x1, x2) + d_Y(y1, y2) + d_Z(z1, z2)`. The completeness of `X`, `Y`, and `Z` ensures the completeness of `W`.\n\n### Step-by-Step Derivation of the Conditions\n\nThe problem of finding an FGH-tripled fixed point can be transformed into finding a standard fixed point for a single operator on the product space.\n\n1.  **Define a Global Operator:** Let `W = X × Y × Z`. Define an operator `T: W → W` as:\n    `T(x, y, z) = (F(x, y, z), G(y, x, z), H(z, y, x))`\n    A triplet `(x*, y*, z*)` is an FGH-tripled fixed point if and only if it is a fixed point of `T`, i.e., `T(x*, y*, z*) = (x*, y*, z*)`.\n\n2.  **Apply the Banach Contraction Principle:** If we can show that `T` is a contraction mapping on the complete metric space `(W, d_W)`, then `T` is guaranteed to have a unique fixed point.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Contraction Condition:** `T` is a contraction if there exists a constant `k ∈ [0, 1)` such that for any two points `w1 = (x1, y1, z1)` and `w2 = (x2, y2, z2)` in `W`, the following inequality holds:\n    `d_W(T(w1), T(w2)) ≤ k * d_W(w1, w2)`\n\n4.  **Impose Conditions on F, G, H:** To satisfy the above inequality, we impose Lipschitz-like conditions on `F`, `G`, and `H`. Assume there exist non-negative constants `a_i, b_i, c_i` such that for all `x_i ∈ X, y_i ∈ Y, z_i ∈ Z`:\n    *   **For F:** `d_X(F(x1, y1, z1), F(x2, y2, z2)) ≤ a1*d_X(x1, x2) + a2*d_Y(y1, y2) + a3*d_Z(z1, z2)`\n    *   **For G:** `d_Y(G(y1, x1, z1), G(y2, x2, z2)) ≤ b1*d_Y(y1, y2) + b2*d_X(x1, x2) + b3*d_Z(z1, z2)`\n    *   **For H:** `d_Z(H(z1, y1, x1), H(z2, y2, x2)) ≤ c1*d_Z(z1, z2) + c2*d_Y(y1, y2) + c3*d_X(x1, x2)`\n\n5.  **Combine the Inequalities:** Using the sum metric `d_W`, we add the three inequalities:\n    `d_W(T(w1), T(w2)) = d_X(...) + d_Y(...) + d_Z(...)`\n    `≤ (a1+b2+c3)d_X(x1,x2) + (a2+b1+c2)d_Y(y1,y2) + (a3+b3+c1)d_Z(z1,z2)`\n\n6.  **Finalize the Contraction Condition:** For the right-hand side to be less than or equal to `k * (d_X + d_Y + d_Z)` for a `k < 1`, we need the coefficients of each distance component to be collectively bounded. A sufficient condition is:\n    `k = max(a1+b2+c3, a2+b1+c2, a3+b3+c1)`\n    The overall condition for `T` to be a contraction is `k < 1`.\n\n### Final Answer: The Conditions\n\nThe conditions for the functions `F: X×Y×Z→X`, `G: Y×X×Z→Y`, and `H: Z×Y×X→Z` to have a unique FGH-tripled fixed point are given by the following theorem, which is an application of the Banach Contraction Principle.\n\n**I. Conditions on the Spaces:**\n*   `(X, d_X)`, `(Y, d_Y)`, and `(Z, d_Z)` must be **complete metric spaces**.\n\n**II. Conditions on the Functions:**\n*   There must exist nine non-negative constants (`a1, a2, a3`, `b1, b2, b3`, and `c1, c2, c3`) such that for all points `(x1, y1, z1)` and `(x2, y2, z2)` in `X×Y×Z`, the following three Lipschitz-type inequalities are satisfied:\n    1.  `d_X(F(x1, y1, z1), F(x2, y2, z2)) ≤ a1*d_X(x1, x2) + a2*d_Y(y1, y2) + a3*d_Z(z1, z2)`\n    2.  `d_Y(G(y1, x1, z1), G(y2, x2, z2)) ≤ b1*d_Y(y1, y2) + b2*d_X(x1, x2) + b3*d_Z(z1, z2)`\n    3.  `d_Z(H(z1, y1, x1), H(z2, y2, x2)) ≤ c1*d_Z(z1, z2) + c2*d_Y(y1, y2) + c3*d_X(x1, x2)`\n\n*   These constants must satisfy the following three aggregate inequalities to ensure a contraction:\n    1.  `a1 + b2 + c3 < 1`\n    2.  `a2 + b1 + c2 < 1`\n    3.  `a3 + b3 + c1 < 1`\n\nIf all these conditions hold, there exists a unique triplet `(x*, y*, z*)` that is an FGH-tripled fixed point.\n\n<<<The conditions are that (X, d_X), (Y, d_Y), and (Z, d_Z) must be complete metric spaces, and the functions F, G, H must satisfy a set of joint contraction-like inequalities. Specifically, there must exist non-negative constants a1, a2, a3, b1, b2, b3, c1, c2, c3 such that for all x_i in X, y_i in Y, z_i in Z:\n1. d_X(F(x1, y1, z1), F(x2, y2, z2)) ≤ a1*d_X(x1, x2) + a2*d_Y(y1, y2) + a3*d_Z(z1, z2)\n2. d_Y(G(y1, x1, z1), G(y2, x2, z2)) ≤ b1*d_Y(y1, y2) + b2*d_X(x1, x2) + b3*d_Z(z1, z2)\n3. d_Z(H(z1, y1, x1), H(z2, y2, x2)) ≤ c1*d_Z(z1, z2) + c2*d_Y(y1, y2) + c3*d_X(x1, x2)\nand these constants must satisfy the following three inequalities:\n1. a1 + b2 + c3 < 1\n2. a2 + b1 + c2 < 1\n3. a3 + b3 + c1 < 1>>>"
