    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Setup**\n\n*   We are given two polynomials, $f(x)$ and $g(x)$, both of degree 3.\n*   We are given that their derivatives, $f'(x)$ and $g'(x)$, are positive for all real numbers $x$. This means both $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are strictly increasing functions.\n*   We need to find the maximum number of fixed points of the composite function $h(x) = f(g(x))$. A fixed point is a value of $x$ such that $h(x) = x$.\n\n**2. Formulate the Equation**\n\nThe fixed points are the solutions to the equation $f(g(x)) = x$.\n\n**3. Determine the Nature of the Equation**\n\n*   Let $f(x) = ax^3 + \\dots$ and $g(x) = px^3 + \\dots$, where $a$ and $p$ are the leading coefficients.\n*   Since $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are of degree 3, the composite function $f(g(x))$ is a polynomial.\n*   The degree of $f(g(x))$ is the product of the degrees of $f$ and $g$, which is $3 \\times 3 = 9$.\n*   The equation for the fixed points, $f(g(x)) - x = 0$, is therefore a polynomial equation of degree 9.\n\n**4. Find an Upper Bound on the Number of Solutions**\n\n*   According to the fundamental theorem of algebra, a polynomial of degree $n$ can have at most $n$ real roots.\n*   Since $f(g(x)) - x = 0$ is a polynomial equation of degree 9, it can have at most 9 real roots.\n*   Therefore, the maximum number of fixed points that $f(g(x))$ can have is at most 9.\n\n**5. Investigate if the Upper Bound is Achievable**\n\nNow, we must determine if it is possible to construct functions $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ that satisfy the given conditions and result in 9 fixed points.\n\n*   **Rolle's Theorem:** If a differentiable function $k(x)$ has $N$ distinct real roots, then its derivative $k'(x)$ must have at least $N-1$ distinct real roots.\n*   Let $k(x) = f(g(x)) - x$. For $k(x)=0$ to have 9 distinct roots, its derivative $k'(x)$ must have at least $9 - 1 = 8$ distinct real roots.\n\n**6. Analyze the Derivative**\n\n*   Let's find the derivative of $k(x)$:\n    $k'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(f(g(x)) - x)$\n*   Using the chain rule:\n    $k'(x) = f'(g(x)) \\cdot g'(x) - 1$\n*   For $k'(x)$ to have 8 roots, the equation $f'(g(x))g'(x) - 1 = 0$ must have 8 roots. This is equivalent to:\n    $f'(g(x))g'(x) = 1$\n\n**7. Analyze the Equation for the Roots of the Derivative**\n\n*   Let's analyze the function $H(x) = f'(g(x))g'(x)$. We need to see if $H(x)=1$ can have 8 solutions.\n*   **Degree of $f'(x)$ and $g'(x)$:** Since $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are degree 3 polynomials, their derivatives $f'(x)$ and $g'(x)$ are degree 2 polynomials (quadratics).\n*   **Degree of $f'(g(x))$:** Since $f'$ is degree 2 and $g$ is degree 3, the composition $f'(g(x))$ is a polynomial of degree $2 \\times 3 = 6$.\n*   **Degree of $H(x)$:** The degree of $H(x) = f'(g(x))g'(x)$ is the sum of the degrees of $f'(g(x))$ and $g'(x)$, which is $6 + 2 = 8$.\n*   The equation $H(x) = 1$ is an 8th-degree polynomial equation. An 8th-degree polynomial equation can have at most 8 real roots.\n\n**8. Conclusion on Feasibility**\n\n*   We have shown that for $f(g(x))$ to have 9 fixed points, the equation $H(x)=1$ must have 8 roots. Since $H(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 8, this is theoretically possible.\n*   For $H(x)=1$ to have 8 real roots, the graph of the polynomial $H(x)$ must cross the horizontal line $y=1$ eight times.\n*   Since the leading coefficients of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ must be positive (to ensure $f', g'$ are positive for large $x$), the leading coefficient of the degree-8 polynomial $H(x)$ will also be positive. This means $H(x) \\to \\infty$ as $x \\to \\pm \\infty$.\n*   To have 8 intersections with $y=1$, the graph of $H(x)$ must \"wiggle\" sufficiently. It would need to have 4 local minima with values less than 1, and 3 local maxima with values greater than 1. This requires its derivative, $H'(x)$, to have 7 distinct real roots.\n*   $H'(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 7. A general 7th-degree polynomial can indeed have 7 distinct real roots.\n*   The conditions $f'(x)>0$ and $g'(x)>0$ are inequality constraints on the coefficients of the polynomials. These constraints define open sets in the space of coefficients, which provides enough freedom to choose polynomials that produce the required number of \"wiggles\" in $H(x)$.\n\nTherefore, there is no fundamental reason preventing the existence of such functions $f$ and $g$. The maximum number of fixed points is indeed the theoretical maximum determined by the degree of the polynomial equation.\n\n**Final Answer Summary:**\n1.  The fixed points of $f(g(x))$ are the roots of the equation $f(g(x)) = x$.\n2.  Since $f$ and $g$ are degree 3 polynomials, $f(g(x))$ is a degree 9 polynomial.\n3.  The equation $f(g(x)) - x = 0$ is a polynomial equation of degree 9.\n4.  A degree 9 polynomial equation can have at most 9 real roots.\n5.  It is possible to construct polynomials $f$ and $g$ satisfying the conditions ($f'>0, g'>0$) such that the resulting equation has 9 distinct real roots.\n\nThus, the maximum number of fixed points is 9.\n\n<<<9>>>"
