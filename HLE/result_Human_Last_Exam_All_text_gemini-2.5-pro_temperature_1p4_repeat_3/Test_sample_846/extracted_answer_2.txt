To be functionally accurate, the picnic table must change its physical shape. At sunrise, upon being exposed to the UV light in sunlight, the table must bend or fold from a flat shape into a bent shape (mimicking the *trans* to *cis* isomerization). At sunset, in the dark, it must spontaneously and gradually return to its original flat shape (mimicking the thermal relaxation from *cis* back to *trans*).
