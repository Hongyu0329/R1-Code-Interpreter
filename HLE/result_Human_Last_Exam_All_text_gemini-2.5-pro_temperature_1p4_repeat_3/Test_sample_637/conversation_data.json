    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to design the observer gain matrix `L`.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Observer and Error Dynamics\n\nThe system is given by:\nx(k + 1) = Ax(k) + Bu(k)\ny(k) = Cx(k)\n\nThe Luenberger observer for this system is:\nx_hat(k + 1) = Ax_hat(k) + Bu(k) + L(y(k) - y_hat(k))\nwhere y_hat(k) = Cx_hat(k) and L is the observer gain matrix.\n\nThe observation error is defined as e(k) = x(k) - x_hat(k). The error dynamics are governed by the equation:\ne(k + 1) = (A - LC)e(k)\n\nThe objective is to make the error `e(k)` equal to zero in the shortest possible number of steps. This is a deadbeat observer. This requires the error dynamics matrix, `A_e = A - LC`, to be nilpotent, meaning `A_e^p = 0` for some integer `p`. The smallest such `p` is the number of steps required for the error to become identically zero, and it is equal to the observability index `v` of the pair (A, C).\n\n### Step 2: Check System Observability and Find the Observability Index\n\nThe system is observable if the observability matrix `O` has full rank, where `n` is the dimension of the state vector (n=4).\nO = [C; CA; CA^2; ...; CA^(n-1)]\n\nLet's compute the necessary components:\nA = [-1 0 0 1; 1 0 0 2; 0 1 0 -1; -1 0 1 -1], C = [1 0 0 0; 1 0 0 1]\n\n`C` has rank 2.\n`CA` = [1 0 0 0; 1 0 0 1] * [-1 0 0 1; 1 0 0 2; 0 1 0 -1; -1 0 1 -1] = [-1 0 0 1; -2 0 1 0]\n\nLet's check the rank of `[C; CA]`:\n`M_2` = [1 0 0 0; 1 0 0 1; -1 0 0 1; -2 0 1 0]\nThe second column of this 4x4 sub-matrix `M_2` only has a non-zero element in the last row. This means `rank(M_2)` < 4. Specifically, the vectors `[1,0,0,0]`, `[0,0,0,1]` (from R2-R1), and `[-2,0,1,0]` are linearly independent, but no combination can produce a vector with a non-zero second element. So, `rank([C; CA]) = 3`.\n\nSince `rank([C; CA]) < 4`, we proceed to calculate `CA^2`:\n`CA^2 = CA * A` = [-1 0 0 1; -2 0 1 0] * [-1 0 0 1; 1 0 0 2; 0 1 0 -1; -1 0 1 -1] = [0 0 1 -2; 2 1 0 -3]\n\nNow check the rank of `[C; CA; CA^2]`. Let's pick 4 rows to form a matrix and check its rank: rows 1, 2, 4, 6.\n`M_obs` = [1 0 0 0; 1 0 0 1; -2 0 1 0; 2 1 0 -3]\nThe determinant is `det(M_obs) = 1 * det([0 0 1; 0 1 0; 1 0 -3]) = 1 * (1 * det([0 1; 1 0])) = -1`.\nSince the determinant is non-zero, the matrix has rank 4.\nThe system is observable. The observability index `v` is the smallest integer such that `rank([C; CA; ...; CA^(v-1)]) = n`. Since `v=1` gives rank 2, `v=2` gives rank 3, and `v=3` gives rank 4, the observability index is `v=3`.\n\nThis means it's possible to design an observer that makes the error zero in exactly 3 steps. This requires finding `L` such that `(A - LC)^3 = 0`.\n\n### Step 3: Pole Placement using the Dual System\n\nDesigning the observer gain `L` for `(A, C)` is equivalent to designing a state-feedback controller gain `K` for the dual system `(A^T, C^T)`. The gain is related by `K = L^T`. The poles of `A - LC` are the same as the poles of `A^T - C^T L^T`. We need all poles to be at `z=0`.\n\nThe dual system is:\n`A_d = A^T` = [-1 1 0 -1; 0 0 1 0; 0 0 0 1; 1 2 -1 -1]\n`B_d = C^T` = [1 1; 0 0; 0 0; 0 1]\n\nThe closed-loop matrix is `A_cl = A_d - B_d K = A^T - C^T L^T`. We want its characteristic polynomial to be `p(z) = z^4`. Let `L^T = F = [f11 f21 f31 f41; f12 f22 f32 f42]`.\nAfter matrix multiplication and simplification, the characteristic polynomial `det(zI - A_cl)` is found to be:\n`p(z) = z^4 + c3*z^3 + c2*z^2 + c1*z + c0`\nwhere the coefficients `c_i` are functions of the gain elements `f_ij`.\n`c3 = 2 + (f11+f12) + f42`\n`c2 = (1+f32) + (1+f11+f12)(1+f42) + (1-f12)(1+f41+f42)`\n`c1 = (2-f22) + (1+f11+f12)(1+f32) + (1-f12)(f31+f32)`\n`c0 = (1+f11+f12)(2-f22) - (1-f12)(1-(f21+f22))`\n\nSetting `c3=c2=c1=c0=0` gives 4 equations for 8 unknowns. We have degrees of freedom to choose a solution.\n\n### Step 4: Find a Specific Solution for L\n\nTo simplify the equations, let's make a strategic choice for one of the variables. Let `f12 = 1`. This makes the `(1-f12)` terms zero, simplifying the equations for `c0, c1, c2`.\nThe system of equations becomes:\n1. `c3: 2 + (f11+1) + f42 = 0  => f11 + f42 = -3`\n2. `c2: (1+f32) + (1+f11+1)(1+f42) = 0 => 1+f32 + (f11+2)(1+f42) = 0`\n3. `c1: (2-f22) + (1+f11+1)(1+f32) = 0 => 2-f22 + (f11+2)(1+f32) = 0`\n4. `c0: (1+f11+1)(2-f22) = 0 => (f11+2)(2-f22) = 0`\n\nFrom equation (4), we have two possibilities: `f11 = -2` or `f22 = 2`.\nIf we substitute `f11 = -2` into the other equations:\n1. `-2 + f42 = -3 => f42 = -1`\n2. `1+f32 + (-2+2)(1-1) = 0 => 1+f32 = 0 => f32 = -1`\n3. `2-f22 + (-2+2)(1-1) = 0 => 2-f22 = 0 => f22 = 2`\nThis gives a consistent solution: `f11=-2, f12=1, f22=2, f32=-1, f42=-1`. The other variables (`f21, f31, f41`) can be chosen freely.\n\n### Step 5: Enforce the Minimal Time Convergence\n\nThe condition `p(z) = z^4` ensures that `(A-LC)^4 = 0`. However, for the shortest convergence time of `v=3` steps, we need the minimal polynomial of `A-LC` to divide `z^3`, which means `(A-LC)^3 = 0`.\n\nLet's substitute the solution family we found into `A_e = A - LC`.\n`L^T = [-2 f21 f31 f41; 1 2 -1 -1]`\n`L = [-2 1; f21 2; f31 -1; f41 -1]`\nThis leads to the error matrix:\n`A_e = A - LC = [0 0 0 0; -1-f21 0 0 0; 1-f31 1 0 0; -f41 0 1 0]`\n\nNow, we enforce `A_e^3 = 0`. Let's compute `A_e^2` and `A_e^3`:\n`A_e^2 = A_e * A_e = [0 0 0 0; 0 0 0 0; -1-f21 0 0 0; 1-f31 1 0 0]`\n`A_e^3 = A_e^2 * A_e = [0 0 0 0; 0 0 0 0; 0 0 0 0; -1-f21 0 0 0]`\n\nFor `A_e^3` to be the zero matrix, we must have:\n`-1 - f21 = 0  => f21 = -1`\n\nThe variables `f31` and `f41` are still free and can be set to the simplest value, zero.\nSo, our final set of gains for `L^T` is:\n`f11=-2, f21=-1, f31=0, f41=0`\n`f12=1,  f22=2,  f32=-1, f42=-1`\n\n`L^T` = [-2 -1 0 0; 1 2 -1 -1]\n\n### Step 6: Final Observer Gain Matrix L\n\nThe observer gain matrix `L` is the transpose of `L^T`.\n`L = (L^T)^T` = [-2 1; -1 2; 0 -1; 0 -1]"
