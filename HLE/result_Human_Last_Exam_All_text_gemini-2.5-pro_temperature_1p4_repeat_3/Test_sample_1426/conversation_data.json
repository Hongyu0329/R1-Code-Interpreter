    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the lowest of the last three notes played by the first violin in Dvořák's Symphony No. 2.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Musical Work and Specific Part**\nThe question asks about a specific passage in a classical music piece:\n*   **Composer:** Antonín Dvořák\n*   **Work:** Symphony No. 2, Op. 4\n*   **Instrument:** First Violin (Violino I)\n*   **Location:** The final three notes of the entire symphony.\n\n**Step 2: Locate the Score**\nTo answer this question accurately, one must consult the musical score. We need to look at the very end of the fourth and final movement, which is marked \"IV. Allegro con fuoco\".\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Final Measure for the First Violin**\nThe symphony ends in the key of B-flat major. In orchestral music, the piece often concludes with a powerful, sustained chord played by the full orchestra. The phrase \"ends on three notes\" for a violin part typically refers to a triple-stop, which is a chord of three notes played simultaneously on the instrument.\n\nUpon examining the score for the final measure, we find that the first violins indeed play a triple-stop chord.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Three Notes**\nWe need to read the notes on the staff for the \"Violino I\" part. The part is written in the treble clef, and we must apply the key signature of B-flat major (which contains two flats: B♭ and E♭).\n\nThe three notes of the final chord, written from the highest to the lowest on the staff, are:\n*   **Top note:** F, located in the top space of the staff. This is the note F5.\n*   **Middle note:** D, located on the fourth line from the bottom of the staff. This is the note D5.\n*   **Bottom note:** B, located on the middle line of the staff. Due to the key signature, this B is flatted, making it B♭. This is the note B♭4.\n\nSo, the three notes that end the symphony for the first violin are F5, D5, and B♭4. These notes form a B-flat major triad, which is the final tonic chord of the symphony.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the Lowest Note**\nNow, we simply compare the pitches of the three notes we identified: F5, D5, and B♭4. In musical notation, a lower octave number indicates a lower pitch. Therefore, B♭4 is lower than both D5 and F5.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe lowest of the three final notes played by the first violin in Dvořák's Symphony No. 2 is B-flat (B♭).\n\n<<<B-flat>>>"
