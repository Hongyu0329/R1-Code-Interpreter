    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the product of the reaction between butadiene and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Reactants and Reaction Type**\n\n*   **Reactant 1: Butadiene.** The structure is CH₂=CH−CH=CH₂. This is a conjugated diene, a key component in Diels-Alder reactions. For the reaction, it must adopt the *s-cis* conformation.\n*   **Reactant 2: 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene.** The structure is CCl₂=CF₂. This is an alkene substituted with electron-withdrawing halogen atoms, making it an excellent dienophile (the \"2π electron\" component).\n*   **Reaction Type:** The reaction between a conjugated diene and a dienophile is a **Diels-Alder reaction**. This is a type of [4+2] cycloaddition, where \"4\" refers to the four π-electrons of the diene and \"2\" refers to the two π-electrons of the dienophile.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Mechanism and Product Formation**\n\nA Diels-Alder reaction is a concerted process that forms a new six-membered ring.\n1.  The two π bonds in the diene and the one π bond in the dienophile break.\n2.  Two new single (σ) bonds and one new double (π) bond are formed.\n3.  The two new σ bonds form between the ends of the diene (carbons 1 and 4) and the two carbons of the dienophile.\n4.  The new π bond forms between the central carbons of the diene (carbons 2 and 3).\n5.  The result is a cyclohexene derivative.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Connectivity of the Product**\n\nLet's trace the atoms from the reactants to the product ring:\n*   The four carbons of 1,3-butadiene: C₁H₂=C₂H−C₃H=C₄H₂\n*   The two carbons of 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene: CαCl₂=CβF₂\n\nThe new six-membered ring is formed by creating bonds between C₁ and one carbon of the dienophile, and between C₄ and the other carbon of the dienophile. Because butadiene (C₁-C₄) is a symmetric molecule, it doesn't matter which end attacks which side of the asymmetric dienophile; the same product is formed.\n\nLet's form the bonds between C₁ and Cβ(F₂), and between C₄ and Cα(Cl₂). The sequence of atoms in the resulting ring will be:\n...−C₂(H)=C₃(H)−C₄(H₂)−Cα(Cl₂)−Cβ(F₂)−C₁(H₂)−...\n\nThe final structure is a cyclohexene ring with two adjacent carbons bearing the halogen substituents.\n\n**Step 4: Draw and Name the Product using IUPAC Nomenclature**\n\nThe structure is a cyclohexene ring with a CCl₂ group and a CF₂ group on adjacent carbons.\n\n```\n      CCl₂ --------- CF₂\n     /                \\\n   CH₂                  CH₂\n   |                    |\n   CH ================= CH\n```\n\nTo name this molecule according to IUPAC rules:\n1.  **Parent Chain:** The six-membered ring with one double bond is a **cyclohexene**.\n2.  **Numbering:** The numbering must start at the double bond, such that it is between C1 and C2. We must then number around the ring in the direction that gives the substituents the lowest possible locants (numbers).\n    *   **Option A:** Number the ring so that the CCl₂ group is on C4 and the CF₂ group is on C5. The name would be prefixed with **4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluoro-**. The locant set is {4, 4, 5, 5}.\n    *   **Option B:** Number the ring in the opposite direction so that the CF₂ group is on C4 and the CCl₂ group is on C5. The name would be prefixed with **5,5-dichloro-4,4-difluoro-**. The locant set is also {4, 4, 5, 5}.\n3.  **Tie-Breaker Rule:** When two numbering schemes yield the same lowest locant set, we assign the lowest number to the substituent group that comes first alphabetically.\n    *   The substituent names are \"dichloro\" and \"difluoro\".\n    *   Alphabetically, \"chloro\" comes before \"fluoro\".\n    *   Therefore, the \"dichloro\" group should be assigned the lower number. Option A gives the \"dichloro\" group position 4, while Option B gives it position 5.\n    *   We choose Option A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe product of the reaction is **4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohex-1-ene**.\n\n<<<4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohex-1-ene>>>"
