    "### Step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Task:** The question asks to identify the letter formed by the buildings of two specific high schools in Pisa, Italy (Istituto Galilei-Pacinotti and Istituto Ulisse Dini), when viewed from above.\n\n2.  **Locate the Schools:** The first step is to find the exact location of these two schools. Using a mapping service like Google Maps or Google Earth and searching for \"Istituto Galilei-Pacinotti, Pisa\" and \"Liceo Scientifico Ulisse Dini, Pisa\" will show their locations. We can confirm that they are indeed located right next to each other, primarily along Via Benedetto Croce.\n\n3.  **Switch to Aerial/Satellite View:** To see the shape of the buildings, we need to switch from the standard map view to a satellite or aerial imagery view. This will show the actual footprints of the buildings.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Building Shapes and their Arrangement:**\n    *   The **Istituto Ulisse Dini** is housed in a long, rectangular building that runs in an east-west direction. This building forms a distinct horizontal line.\n    *   The **Istituto Galilei-Pacinotti** is a larger complex. Its most prominent building is a long, rectangular structure that runs in a north-south direction. This building is positioned directly south of the center of the Istituto Ulisse Dini building.\n    *   When you view these two main buildings together, the horizontal building of Ulisse Dini forms the top bar, and the vertical building of Galilei-Pacinotti forms the central stem extending downwards from the middle of the top bar.\n\n5.  **Determine the Letter:** The combination of a horizontal top bar with a vertical stem extending down from its center forms the distinct shape of a capital letter **T**.\n\n### Careful Points:\n\n*   **Viewpoint:** The shape is only visible from an aerial perspective (from above), as specified in the question.\n*   **Combination of Buildings:** It is crucial to understand that the letter is not formed by one school alone, but by the specific arrangement of the two adjacent school buildings.\n*   **Idealization:** Real-world buildings are not perfect geometric shapes. There are other smaller wings, courtyards, and attachments. However, the dominant and most recognizable shape formed by the main structures of the two schools is a \"T\".\n*   **School Identification:** The horizontal top part of the letter is the Liceo Ulisse Dini. The vertical stem of the letter is the Istituto Galilei-Pacinotti.\n\nBy following these steps and considering these points, we can confidently conclude the shape they form.\n\n<<<T>>>"
