    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the scansion for the line \"et tibi bene esse soli quom sibi sit male\". The meter is an iambic senarius, common in Roman comedy.\n\n**Line:** `et tibi bene esse soli quom sibi sit male`\n\n**Careful Points & Rules:**\n1.  **Iambic Senarius:** The base meter is six iambic feet (S L). However, substitutions are frequent. Common substitutions include a Spondee (L L), Anapest (S S L), Tribrach (S S S), and occasionally a Dactyl (L S S) or Proceleusmatic (S S S S).\n2.  **Elision:** A final vowel (or vowel + m) is dropped before a word beginning with a vowel or 'h'. Here, `bene esse` becomes `ben' esse`.\n3.  **Iambic Shortening (Brevis Brevians):** A key rule in early Latin verse. In a two-syllable word with a short followed by a long syllable (S L), and with the word accent on the first short syllable, the final long syllable can be shortened. This makes the word S S. This rule applies to `tibi` (`tíbī` -> `tíbi`, S S) and `sibi` (`síbī` -> `síbi`, S S).\n4.  **Long by Position:** A syllable is long if its vowel is followed by two consonants (which can span across words).\n5.  **Brevis in Longo:** The final syllable of a line is metrically long, regardless of its natural quantity. A pyrrhic foot (S S) at the end of the line functions as an iambus (S L).\n\n**Step-by-Step Scansion:**\n\n1.  **Foot 1: `et tibi`**\n    *   `et`: Short vowel 'e'. The syllable is short (S).\n    *   `tibi`: By the rule of *brevis brevians*, the word scans as short-short (S S).\n    *   The first foot is `et ti bi`, which makes a **Tribrach (S S S)**, a valid substitution for an iambus.\n\n2.  **Foot 2: `bene esse` (part 1)**\n    *   First, we apply elision: `bene esse` becomes `ben' esse`.\n    *   The syllables of `ben' esse` are `be-nes-se`.\n    *   The syllable `be-` is short (S).\n    *   The syllable `-nes-` is long by position because the vowel 'e' is followed by the double consonant 'ss'. It is long (L).\n    *   These two syllables, `be nes-`, form a perfect **Iambus (S L)**.\n\n3.  **Foot 3: `esse soli` (part 1)**\n    *   The last syllable of `esse` is `-se`, which is short (S).\n    *   The next word is `soli`. The first syllable `sō-` has a naturally long 'o'. It is long (L).\n    *   These two syllables, `-se sō-`, form another **Iambus (S L)**.\n\n4.  **Foot 4: `soli quom`**\n    *   The second syllable of `sōlī` is `-lī`, which has a naturally long 'ī'. It is long (L).\n    *   The next word is `quom`. Its vowel is followed by 'm' and the next word begins with 's' (`sibi`). This makes the syllable long by position. It is long (L).\n    *   These two syllables, `-lī quom`, form a **Spondee (L L)**, a valid substitution.\n\n5.  **Foot 5: `sibi sit`**\n    *   `sibi`: Like `tibi`, this word scans as short-short (S S) due to *brevis brevians*.\n    *   `sit`: The vowel 'i' is short, but it is followed by 't', and the next word `male` begins with 'm'. The two consonants (`t m`) make the syllable long by position. It is long (L).\n    *   These three syllables, `si bi sit`, form an **Anapest (S S L)**, a valid substitution.\n\n6.  **Foot 6: `male`**\n    *   The word `male` has two short syllables: `ma-` (S) and `-le` (S).\n    *   At the end of a line, a pyrrhic foot (S S) is treated as an iambus due to the principle of *brevis in longo*, where the final syllable slot must be long.\n    *   Therefore, `ma le` scans as an **Iambus (S L)**.\n\n**Final Result:**\nCombining the feet, the scansion is:\n`et ti bi | ben' es | se sō | lī quom | si bi sit | ma le`\nS S S | S L | S L | L L | S S L | S L\n\n<<<S S S S L S L L L S S L S L>>>"
