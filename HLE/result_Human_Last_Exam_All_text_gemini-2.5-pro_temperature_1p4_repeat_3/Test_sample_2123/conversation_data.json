    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the question's core components.**\n*   **The setting:** The wide boulevards of Vienna.\n*   **The text:** A Russian translation of an essay.\n*   **The subject:** The surname of an English poet.\n*   **The link:** The poet's surname appears *within the description* of the boulevards.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the key linguistic clue.**\nThe question hinges on a likely pun or phonetic similarity that exists in the Russian language but not necessarily in the original language of the essay. The most prominent descriptive word for \"wide boulevards\" is \"wide.\"\n\n**Step 3: Translate the key word into Russian.**\nThe Russian adjective for \"wide\" is **\"широкий\"** (pronounced \"shirokiy\").\n\n**Step 4: Look for an English poet's surname that sounds like this Russian word.**\nLet's analyze the pronunciation of \"широкий\" ([ʂɨˈrokʲɪj]). It starts with a distinct \"sh\" sound. The surname that has a strong phonetic resemblance to \"shirokiy\" is **Shelley**.\n*   \"Shirokiy\" -> \"Shelley\"\n*   In Russian, the surname \"Shelley\" is written as **\"Шелли\"** (pronounced \"Shelli\"), which further highlights the similarity in sound.\n\n**Step 5: Verify the poet's identity and relevance.**\nPercy Bysshe Shelley is a major English Romantic poet, fitting the description of \"an English poet.\"\n\n**Step 6: Synthesize the conclusion.**\nWhen an essay describing Vienna's \"wide boulevards\" is translated into Russian, the adjective \"широкий\" is used. This word's sound brings to mind the surname of the English poet Percy Bysshe Shelley. Therefore, his surname \"appears\" in the description through this phonetic association. The question asks for this surname in English.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n*   The fact that it is a *Russian translation* is the most critical piece of information, as the wordplay only exists in Russian.\n*   The question is a riddle based on linguistics, not a direct literary reference that requires knowledge of a specific essay.\n*   The request is for the surname in English, not in Russian transliteration.\n\nFinal Answer Derivation:\nThe Russian word for \"wide\" is \"широкий\" (shirokiy). This sounds like the surname of the English poet Shelley.\n\n<<<Shelley>>>"
