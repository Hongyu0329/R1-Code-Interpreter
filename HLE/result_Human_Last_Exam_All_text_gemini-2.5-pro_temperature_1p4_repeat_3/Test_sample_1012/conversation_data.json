    "**Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Identify the Threat:** The question asks for security against an \"arbitrarily powerful quantum computer.\" For symmetric-key cryptography, the most significant threat from a quantum computer is Grover's algorithm.\n\n2.  **Understand the Classical Attack:** For a symmetric key of length 'n' bits, a classical computer would need to perform a brute-force search. On average, this requires 2^(n-1) attempts, and in the worst case, 2^n attempts. The computational complexity is O(2^n). A 128-bit key, for example, has 2^128 possible combinations, making a classical brute-force attack computationally infeasible. This is why AES-128 is considered secure against classical computers.\n\n3.  **Understand the Quantum Attack (Grover's Algorithm):** Grover's algorithm is a quantum search algorithm that can find a specific item in an unsorted database of N items much faster than a classical computer. It provides a quadratic speedup. Instead of O(N) operations, it requires only O(√N) operations.\n    *   When applied to cracking an n-bit symmetric key, the search space (the \"database\") has N = 2^n possible keys.\n    *   Grover's algorithm can find the correct key in approximately O(√(2^n)) = O(2^(n/2)) operations.\n\n4.  **Determine the Target Security Level:** A widely accepted benchmark for long-term security is the \"128-bit security level.\" This means an attacker would need to perform about 2^128 computations to break the encryption, which is considered infeasible with current and foreseeable technology. For post-quantum security, we want the quantum attack to be at least this difficult.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Required Key Length for Quantum Resistance:**\n    *   Let 'k' be the required symmetric key length to be secure against a quantum computer.\n    *   The effective security of this key against Grover's algorithm is k/2 bits of security.\n    *   We want this effective quantum security to be at least 128 bits.\n    *   Therefore, we set up the inequality: k/2 ≥ 128\n    *   Solving for 'k', we get: k ≥ 256\n\n6.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   A. **256 bits:** A 256-bit key would have an effective security level of 256/2 = 128 bits against a quantum computer using Grover's algorithm. This meets the minimum target security level.\n    *   B. **128 bits:** A 128-bit key would have an effective security level of 128/2 = 64 bits. This is considered breakable and not secure.\n    *   C. **512 bits:** Provides 512/2 = 256 bits of quantum security. This is secure, but more than the minimum required.\n    *   D. **1024 bits:** Provides 1024/2 = 512 bits of quantum security. Secure, but not the minimum.\n    *   E. **2048 bits:** Provides 2048/2 = 1024 bits of quantum security. Secure, but not the minimum.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Symmetric vs. Asymmetric:** This analysis applies *only* to symmetric-key algorithms (like AES). Asymmetric algorithms (like RSA and ECC) are threatened by a different quantum algorithm, Shor's algorithm, which offers an exponential speedup and requires a much more significant increase in key size to remain secure.\n*   **\"At Least\":** The question asks for the minimum key length that satisfies the security requirement. While 512, 1024, and 2048 are also secure, 256 is the smallest standard key size that achieves the 128-bit post-quantum security level.\n*   **The \"Halving\" Effect:** The key takeaway is that Grover's algorithm effectively halves the bit-strength of a symmetric key. To counteract this and maintain a desired security level (e.g., 128-bit), you must double the key length.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nTo achieve a 128-bit security level against an attack from an arbitrarily powerful quantum computer, the minimum required symmetric key length is 256 bits.\n\n<<<A>>>"
