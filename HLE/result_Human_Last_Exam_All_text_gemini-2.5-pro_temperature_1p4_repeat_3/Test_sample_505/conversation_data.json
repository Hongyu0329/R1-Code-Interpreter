    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the maximum number of logical qubits that can be encoded.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze a Single Patch of Surface Code\n\nFirst, let's understand how logical qubits are encoded in a single patch of surface code.\n*   A standard, rectangular patch of surface code is known as a planar code. By defining specific boundary conditions (e.g., \"smooth\" and \"rough\" boundaries), a single patch without any holes can encode exactly **one logical qubit**.\n*   The logical operators for this qubit are represented by strings of Pauli operators that connect opposite boundaries of the patch.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Effect of Adding Holes\n\nNext, we consider the impact of creating holes within a patch.\n*   A \"hole\" is a region inside the surface code lattice where stabilizer measurements are intentionally turned off.\n*   Topologically, each hole introduces a new boundary. The presence of these new boundaries allows for the definition of new, independent logical operators.\n*   For each hole you add to a patch, you gain the ability to encode **one additional logical qubit**. One logical operator for this new qubit can be a loop of Pauli operators circling the hole, and the other can be a string connecting the hole's boundary to another boundary (either another hole or the patch's outer boundary).\n\n### Step 3: Formulate a General Rule for a Single Patch\n\nBased on the points above, we can create a simple rule for the number of logical qubits, `k`, that can be encoded in a single patch with `h` holes:\n\n*   `k = 1 (from the base patch) + h (from the holes)`\n*   So, for a single patch, **`k = h + 1`**.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the Given System\n\nThe question specifies a system with the following components:\n*   Number of patches: **2**\n*   Total number of holes: **2**\n\nOur goal is to find the maximum total number of logical qubits that can be encoded by distributing these two holes among the two patches. Let `k_total` be the total number of logical qubits. Let `h1` be the number of holes in Patch 1 and `h2` be the number of holes in Patch 2.\n\nThe total number of qubits is the sum of the qubits from each patch:\n`k_total = k_patch1 + k_patch2`\n\nWe are given the constraint:\n`h1 + h2 = 2`\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the Total Number of Logical Qubits\n\nWe can use our formula from Step 3 for each patch:\n*   `k_patch1 = h1 + 1`\n*   `k_patch2 = h2 + 1`\n\nNow, substitute these into the equation for the total number of qubits:\n`k_total = (h1 + 1) + (h2 + 1)`\n`k_total = h1 + h2 + 2`\n\nSince we know that the total number of holes `h1 + h2` must be 2, we can substitute this value into the equation:\n`k_total = (2) + 2`\n`k_total = 4`\n\n### Step 6: Verify with Possible Configurations\n\nLet's check if this result holds for all possible distributions of the two holes.\n\n*   **Configuration A: Both holes in one patch.**\n    *   Patch 1 has `h1 = 2` holes. `k1 = 2 + 1 = 3` logical qubits.\n    *   Patch 2 has `h2 = 0` holes. `k2 = 0 + 1 = 1` logical qubit.\n    *   Total: `3 + 1 = 4` logical qubits.\n\n*   **Configuration B: One hole in each patch.**\n    *   Patch 1 has `h1 = 1` hole. `k1 = 1 + 1 = 2` logical qubits.\n    *   Patch 2 has `h2 = 1` hole. `k2 = 1 + 1 = 2` logical qubits.\n    *   Total: `2 + 2 = 4` logical qubits.\n\nBoth possible configurations yield the same total of 4 logical qubits. Therefore, the maximum number is 4.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe total number of logical qubits is the sum of the base qubits from each patch (1 per patch) and the additional qubits from each hole (1 per hole).\n*   Qubits from patches = 2 patches × 1 qubit/patch = 2\n*   Qubits from holes = 2 holes × 1 qubit/hole = 2\n*   Maximum Total Logical Qubits = 2 + 2 = 4\n\n<<<4>>>"
