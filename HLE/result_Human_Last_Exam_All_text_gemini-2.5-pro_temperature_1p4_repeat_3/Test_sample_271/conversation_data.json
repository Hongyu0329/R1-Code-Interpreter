    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the polynomial and find its splitting field.**\n\nLet $f(x) = x^7 - 2 x^5 - 9 x^3 + 3 x^2 + 18 x - 6$. We first try to factor this polynomial. By testing for groupings of terms, we can find a factorization:\n$f(x) = (x^7 - 9x^3) + (-2x^5 + 18x) + (3x^2 - 6)$\n$f(x) = x^3(x^4 - 9) - 2x(x^4 - 9) + 3(x^2 - 2)$\n$f(x) = (x^3 - 2x)(x^4 - 9) + 3(x^2 - 2)$\n$f(x) = x(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 + 3) + 3(x^2 - 2)$\n$f(x) = (x^2 - 2)[x(x^2 - 3)(x^2 + 3) + 3]$\n$f(x) = (x^2 - 2)[x(x^4 - 9) + 3]$\n$f(x) = (x^2 - 2)(x^5 - 9x + 3)$\n\nLet $g(x) = x^2 - 2$ and $h(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$.\nThe roots of $g(x)$ are $\\pm \\sqrt{2}$. The splitting field of $g(x)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is $K_g = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. The Galois group $\\text{Gal}(K_g/\\mathbb{Q})$ is isomorphic to the cyclic group of order 2, $C_2$.\n\nNow, let's analyze $h(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$. We apply Eisenstein's criterion with the prime $p=3$.\n1. The leading coefficient, 1, is not divisible by 3.\n2. The other coefficients (0, 0, -9, 3) are all divisible by 3.\n3. The constant term, 3, is not divisible by $3^2=9$.\nTherefore, $h(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nLet $K_h$ be the splitting field of $h(x)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$. The Galois group of $h(x)$, $G_h = \\text{Gal}(K_h/\\mathbb{Q})$, is a transitive subgroup of the symmetric group $S_5$.\nTo determine which subgroup it is, we examine the roots of $h(x)$. The derivative is $h'(x) = 5x^4 - 9$. The real roots of $h'(x)$ are $x = \\pm \\sqrt[4]{9/5}$. Since there are two real critical points, $h(x)$ has at most three real roots. By evaluating $h(x)$ at these critical points, we find $h(\\sqrt[4]{9/5}) < 0$ and $h(-\\sqrt[4]{9/5}) > 0$. This confirms that $h(x)$ has exactly three real roots and two complex conjugate roots.\n\nThe Galois group of an irreducible quintic polynomial with three real roots is isomorphic to $S_5$. This is because the group must contain a 5-cycle (due to irreducibility of prime degree) and a transposition (the complex conjugation swapping the two complex roots). A transitive subgroup of $S_5$ containing a 5-cycle and a transposition is $S_5$ itself.\nSo, $G_h = \\text{Gal}(K_h/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong S_5$.\n\nThe splitting field $K$ of $f(x)$ is the compositum of $K_g$ and $K_h$, i.e., $K = K_g K_h = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\alpha_1, \\dots, \\alpha_5)$, where $\\alpha_i$ are the roots of $h(x)$.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Galois group of K over Q.**\n\nLet $G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$. The structure of $G$ depends on the intersection of the fields $K_g$ and $K_h$. By Galois theory, $G \\cong \\text{Gal}(K_g/\\mathbb{Q}) \\times \\text{Gal}(K_h/\\mathbb{Q})$ if and only if $K_g \\cap K_h = \\mathbb{Q}$.\n$K_g = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. The Galois group of $K_h/\\mathbb{Q}$ is $S_5$. The subgroups of $S_5$ of index 2 correspond to quadratic extensions inside $K_h$. The only proper non-trivial normal subgroup of $S_5$ is the alternating group $A_5$, which has index 2. The corresponding fixed field is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta_h})$, where $\\Delta_h$ is the discriminant of $h(x)$. This is the unique quadratic subfield of $K_h$.\nThe discriminant of $x^5+ax+b$ is $\\Delta = 5^5 b^4 + 4^4 a^5$. For $h(x)$, $a=-9, b=3$.\n$\\Delta_h = 5^5 \\cdot 3^4 + 4^4 \\cdot (-9)^5 = 3^4(5^5 - 4^4 \\cdot 9^3) = 81(3125 - 256 \\cdot 729) = 81(3125 - 186624) = 81(-183499)$.\nThe quadratic subfield of $K_h$ is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-183499})$.\nFor $K_g \\subset K_h$, we would need $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-183499})$. This is equivalent to $-183499 = 2d^2$ for some $d \\in \\mathbb{Q}$, which is impossible.\nTherefore, $K_g \\cap K_h = \\mathbb{Q}$.\nThis implies that $G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong \\text{Gal}(K_g/\\mathbb{Q}) \\times \\text{Gal}(K_h/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong C_2 \\times S_5$.\nThe degree of the extension is $[K:\\mathbb{Q}] = |G| = |C_2| \\cdot |S_5| = 2 \\cdot 120 = 240$.\n\n**Step 3: Find the possible degrees of normal intermediate fields.**\n\nWe are looking for the possible degrees of normal field extensions $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ such that $\\mathbb{Q} \\subsetneq L \\subsetneq K$.\nBy the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory, these extensions $L$ are in one-to-one correspondence with the proper non-trivial normal subgroups $H$ of $G = C_2 \\times S_5$.\nThe degree of such an extension is given by $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = [G:H] = |G|/|H|$.\nWe need to find all proper non-trivial normal subgroups of $C_2 \\times S_5$.\nThe normal subgroups of $C_2$ are $\\{e\\}$ and $C_2$.\nThe normal subgroups of $S_5$ are $\\{e\\}$, $A_5$, and $S_5$.\n\n1.  **Product Normal Subgroups:** Subgroups of the form $N_1 \\times N_2$, where $N_1 \\unlhd C_2$ and $N_2 \\unlhd S_5$.\n    *   $H_1 = C_2 \\times \\{e\\}$: $|H_1|=2$. $[G:H_1] = 240/2 = 120$.\n    *   $H_2 = \\{e\\} \\times S_5$: $|H_2|=120$. $[G:H_2] = 240/120 = 2$.\n    *   $H_3 = \\{e\\} \\times A_5$: $|H_3|=60$. $[G:H_3] = 240/60 = 4$.\n    *   $H_4 = C_2 \\times A_5$: $|H_4|=2 \\cdot 60=120$. $[G:H_4] = 240/120 = 2$.\n\n2.  **\"Diagonal\" Normal Subgroups:** These subgroups are not direct products of subgroups of the factors. Such subgroups arise from isomorphisms between quotient groups of normal subgroups of the factors. The composition factors of $C_2$ is $\\{C_2\\}$ and of $S_5$ are $\\{C_2, A_5\\}$. Since they share a common composition factor $C_2$, there can be a \"diagonal\" normal subgroup.\n    This occurs via an isomorphism $\\phi: C_2/\\{e\\} \\to S_5/A_5$. Both quotient groups are isomorphic to $C_2$. Let $c$ be the non-trivial element of $C_2$. The isomorphism maps $c$ to the non-trivial coset in $S_5/A_5$.\n    The resulting normal subgroup is $H_5 = \\{(g, \\sigma) \\in C_2 \\times S_5 \\mid \\phi(g) = \\sigma A_5\\}$.\n    This subgroup consists of pairs $(e, \\alpha)$ where $\\alpha \\in A_5$, and pairs $(c, \\tau)$ where $\\tau$ is an odd permutation.\n    The order of this subgroup is $|H_5| = |A_5| + |S_5 \\setminus A_5| = 60 + 60 = 120$.\n    The index is $[G:H_5] = 240/120 = 2$.\n\n**Step 4: List the possible degrees.**\n\nThe indices of the proper non-trivial normal subgroups of $G$ are the possible degrees for the normal extension $L/\\mathbb{Q}$.\nThe indices we found are:\n*   From $H_1$: 120\n*   From $H_2$: 2\n*   From $H_3$: 4\n*   From $H_4$: 2\n*   From $H_5$: 2\n\nThe set of distinct values for the possible degrees is $\\{2, 4, 120\\}$."
