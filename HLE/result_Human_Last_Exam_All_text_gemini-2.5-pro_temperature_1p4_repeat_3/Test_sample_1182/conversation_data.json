    "An elegant step-by-step derivation is as follows.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the question**\nWe need to find the number of ordinary double points (nodes) in the special fiber of the stable model of the curve $C$ given by the equation $y^2 = 8x^5 + 4x^4 + 4x^3 + x^2 + 8x$ over the 2-adic field $\\mathbb{Q}_2$. Let $R=\\mathbb{Z}_2$ be the ring of integers and $k=\\mathbb{F}_2$ be the residue field. The genus of the curve $C$ is $g = \\lfloor (\\text{deg}(f)-1)/2 \\rfloor = \\lfloor (5-1)/2 \\rfloor = 2$.\n\n**Step 2: Find a better model for the curve**\nLet's write the equation as $y^2 = f(x)$, where $f(x) = 8x^5 + 4x^4 + 4x^3 + x^2 + 8x$.\nWe can consider this equation as a model for the curve over $\\mathbb{Z}_2$. Let's reduce it modulo 2.\n$\\tilde{C}: y^2 \\equiv x^2 \\pmod{2}$.\nThis can be written as $y^2 - x^2 = (y-x)^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$ since the characteristic is 2.\nThis shows that the reduction is a non-reduced scheme, specifically a \"double line\" $y=x$. The curve $C$ has bad reduction at $p=2$.\n\nTo get a better model, we perform a change of variables. The singularity of the reduction is along the line $y=x$. This suggests a transformation centered there. Let $y = Y+x$.\n$(Y+x)^2 = 8x^5 + 4x^4 + 4x^3 + x^2 + 8x$\n$Y^2 + 2xY + x^2 = 8x^5 + 4x^4 + 4x^3 + x^2 + 8x$\n$Y^2 + 2xY = 8x^5 + 4x^4 + 4x^3 + 8x$\nThis equation is not yet in integral form, as dividing by 2 would create fractions. Let's make the substitution $Y=2y_1$. This is a standard technique to \"resolve\" the non-reduced structure.\n$(2y_1)^2 + 2x(2y_1) = 8x^5 + 4x^4 + 4x^3 + 8x$\n$4y_1^2 + 4xy_1 = 8x^5 + 4x^4 + 4x^3 + 8x$\nNow we can divide the entire equation by 4:\n$y_1^2 + xy_1 = 2x^5 + x^4 + x^3 + 2x$\nLet's call this new model $C'$. This model is defined over $\\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the reduction of the new model**\nLet's reduce the equation of $C'$ modulo 2:\n$\\tilde{C'}: y_1^2 + xy_1 \\equiv x^4 + x^3 \\pmod{2}$\nor $\\tilde{C'}: y_1^2 + xy_1 + x^4 + x^3 = 0$ over $\\mathbb{F}_2$.\n\nThis is the equation of the special fiber of our new model $C'$. This curve is singular, but it is reduced. We can now analyze this reduced curve to understand the stable reduction.\n\n**Step 4: Compute the geometric genus of the reduced curve**\nThe curve $\\tilde{C'}$ is given by $y_1^2 + xy_1 + x^3(x+1) = 0$ over $\\mathbb{F}_2$. This can be viewed as a quadratic equation for $y_1$ over the function field $\\mathbb{F}_2(x)$.\nThis equation is reducible over $\\mathbb{F}_2(x)$ if and only if $x^3(x+1)$ is of the form $u^2+xu$ for some rational function $u \\in \\mathbb{F}_2(x)$.\nLet's try to find such a $u$. Let $u=x^2$. Then $u^2+xu = (x^2)^2+x(x^2)=x^4+x^3$. This matches perfectly.\nSo the quadratic polynomial $T^2+xT+x^4+x^3$ factors as $(T-u)(T-(u+x))$ in characteristic 2, which is $(T-x^2)(T-(x^2+x))$.\nSo, the curve $\\tilde{C'}$ decomposes into two irreducible components over $\\mathbb{F}_2$:\n$C_1: y_1 = x^2$\n$C_2: y_1 = x^2+x$\nBoth components are parabolas, which are rational curves (isomorphic to the projective line $\\mathbb{P}^1_{\\mathbb{F}_2}$). Thus, their geometric genera are $p_g(C_1)=0$ and $p_g(C_2)=0$.\n\nTo find the geometric genus of the reducible curve $\\tilde{C'}$, we need to see how its components intersect. The intersection points are found by solving the system:\n$y_1=x^2$ and $y_1=x^2+x$. This gives $x^2 = x^2+x$, which implies $x=0$. If $x=0$, then $y_1=0$. So they intersect at the single affine point $(0,0)$.\nTo find intersections at infinity, we homogenize the component equations. Both components are degree 2 curves. By Bezout's theorem, they must intersect in $2 \\times 2 = 4$ points, counted with multiplicity. We found one intersection point $(0,0)$ in the affine plane. It can be shown that this intersection is transversal (multiplicity 1). The remaining intersection of multiplicity 3 is at the point at infinity $(0:1:0)$.\n\nThe geometric genus of a reducible curve whose components are $C_i$ is given by $p_g = \\sum p_g(C_i) + h^1(\\Gamma)$, where $\\Gamma$ is the dual graph of the curve (vertices are components, edges are intersection points).\nHere, we have two components ($C_1, C_2$) and two intersection points. The graph $\\Gamma$ has two vertices and two edges connecting them. The first Betti number (number of independent cycles) is $h^1(\\Gamma) = (\\text{number of edges}) - (\\text{number of vertices}) + 1 = 2 - 2 + 1 = 1$.\nSo, the geometric genus of $\\tilde{C'}$ is:\n$p_g(\\tilde{C'}) = p_g(C_1) + p_g(C_2) + h^1(\\Gamma) = 0 + 0 + 1 = 1$.\n\n**Step 5: Relate the genus drop to the number of double points**\nThe genus of the original curve is $g=2$. The geometric genus of the special fiber of our new model $C'$ is $p_g(\\tilde{C'})=1$. The genus has dropped by $g - p_g(\\tilde{C'}) = 2 - 1 = 1$.\nThe model $C'$ is not yet the stable model because its special fiber $\\tilde{C'}$ has singularities (the two intersection points). The stable model is obtained by resolving these singularities, a process which preserves the arithmetic genus.\n\nThe number of double points in the stable reduction is closely related to the genus drop. For a curve $C$ with genus $g$, its stable reduction has a special fiber $\\mathcal{C}_s$ whose arithmetic genus is also $g$. For a stable curve, all singularities are ordinary double points (nodes). Let $\\delta$ be the number of these nodes. Let the irreducible components of $\\mathcal{C}_s$ be $\\Gamma_i$ with geometric genera $p_g(\\Gamma_i)$. The arithmetic genus is given by the formula:\n$p_a(\\mathcal{C}_s) = \\sum p_g(\\Gamma_i) + \\delta$.\n(This simplified formula holds if the dual graph of the components is a tree. A more general formula is $p_a(\\mathcal{C}_s) = \\sum p_g(\\Gamma_i) + \\delta - N + c$, where N is number of components, c is number of connected components of the graph.)\n\nIn many cases, the stable reduction consists of a single irreducible component $\\Gamma$ of smaller genus, plus some number of nodes $\\delta$ on it. In this case, $p_a(\\mathcal{C}_s) = p_g(\\Gamma) + \\delta$.\nOur analysis showed that the reduction leads to a curve structure of geometric genus 1. This strongly suggests that the stable reduction contains a \"core\" component of genus 1. If we assume the stable fiber consists of one component of genus 1, then:\n$g = p_g(\\Gamma) + \\delta$\n$2 = 1 + \\delta$\n$\\delta = 1$\nThis implies that the stable reduction has one double point. This is the most straightforward interpretation of the genus drop from 2 to 1.\n\nFinal check: The number of double points measures the \"disappeared cycles\" when reducing the curve. The original curve has 2 cycles. The reduced model has 1 cycle (as $p_g=1$). The difference is 1, which corresponds to one double point in the stable model.\n\n>>>1"
