    "Answering this question requires a step-by-step analysis of the matrix derived from the flag of Tonga.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the structure of the Tongan flag and the corresponding matrix.\n\nThe flag of Tonga is composed of two main parts:\n1.  A large red field.\n2.  A white canton (a rectangle in the top-left corner). Inside this canton, there is a red couped cross. A \"couped\" cross is one that does not extend to the edges of the canton.\n\nLet the image be represented by an `H x W` matrix, `M`. The canton occupies the top-left `h x w` submatrix of `M`, where `h < H` and `w < W`.\nThe problem states that every red pixel is given a value `a`, and every white pixel a value `b`.\n\nThe matrix `M` can be represented in a block structure:\n```\nM = | C   R_tr |\n    | R_bl  R_br |\n```\n-   The blocks `R_tr` (top-right), `R_bl` (bottom-left), and `R_br` (bottom-right) correspond to the red field of the flag. All entries in these blocks are `a`.\n-   The block `C` (top-left, `h x w`) is the canton. It contains both red and white pixels. The red pixels, forming the cross, have the value `a`. The white background pixels have the value `b`.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the structure of the rows of the matrix M.\n\nThe rank of a matrix is the dimension of the vector space spanned by its rows (or columns). Let's analyze the rows of `M`.\n\n1.  **Rows outside the canton (rows `h+1` to `H`):** These rows correspond to the bottom part of the red field. Every pixel is red, so every entry in these rows is `a`.\n    -   Row `i` for `i > h`: `R_i = (a, a, ..., a)`.\n    All these `H-h` rows are identical.\n\n2.  **Rows within the canton (rows `1` to `h`):** These rows are more complex. Let's look at the structure of the red cross within the canton `C`. The cross is formed by the union of a horizontal red bar and a vertical red bar.\n    -   Let the horizontal bar occupy rows `r_1` to `r_2` of the canton.\n    -   Let the vertical bar occupy columns `c_1` to `c_2` of the canton.\n    A pixel `(i, j)` in the canton (where `1 <= i <= h`, `1 <= j <= w`) is red if `r_1 <= i <= r_2` OR `c_1 <= j <= c_2`.\n\n    Now let's examine the rows `R_i` for `1 <= i <= h`:\n    -   **Case A: Row `i` corresponds to the horizontal bar of the cross (`r_1 <= i <= r_2`).**\n        In this case, every pixel in row `i` of the canton is red. So, the first `w` entries of `R_i` are `a`. The remaining `W-w` entries are also `a` (since they are part of the red field). Therefore, `R_i = (a, a, ..., a)`. These rows are identical to the rows from the bottom part of the flag.\n\n    -   **Case B: Row `i` does not correspond to the horizontal bar of the cross (i.e., `i < r_1` or `i > r_2`).**\n        In this case, the first `w` entries of `R_i` (the canton part) are a mix of `a`'s and `b`'s. The pixels corresponding to the vertical bar of the cross (`c_1 <= j <= c_2`) are red (`a`), and the others are white (`b`). The remaining `W-w` entries of `R_i` are all `a`.\n        So, `R_i = (b, ..., b, a, ..., a, b, ..., b, | a, ..., a)`.\n        The `a`'s in the first part are at columns `c_1` to `c_2`. All rows in this category are identical to each other.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the number of unique rows.\n\nFrom the analysis in Step 2, we can see that all the rows of the matrix `M` must be one of only two possible types:\n1.  **Type 1:** An all-`a` row vector: `v_1 = (a, a, ..., a)`. This applies to all rows from `h+1` to `H`, and all rows `i` from `1` to `h` where `r_1 <= i <= r_2`.\n2.  **Type 2:** A mixed row vector: `v_2 = (b, ..., b, a, ..., a, b, ..., b, | a, ..., a)`. This applies to all rows `i` from `1` to `h` where `i < r_1` or `i > r_2`.\n\nThe row space of `M` is spanned by these two vectors, `v_1` and `v_2`. Therefore, the rank of `M` can be at most 2.\n\n### Step 4: Find the maximal possible rank.\n\nThe rank will be 2 if and only if the two vectors `v_1` and `v_2` are linearly independent. The rank will be 1 if they are linearly dependent (and not both zero). The rank will be 0 only if `a=b=0`. We want to find the maximal rank, so we should see if we can choose `a` and `b` to make the vectors linearly independent.\n\nThe two vectors `v_1` and `v_2` are linearly dependent if one is a scalar multiple of the other. Let's check the conditions under which this happens.\n\n-   **If `a = b`:** Then `v_2` becomes `(a, ..., a, a, ..., a, a, ..., a, | a, ..., a)`, which is identical to `v_1`. In this case, the vectors are dependent, and the rank is 1 (assuming `a != 0`).\n\n-   **If `a != b`:** Let's assume there exists a scalar `k` such that `v_2 = k * v_1`.\n    `v_1 = (a, a, ..., a)`\n    `v_2 = (b, ..., b, a, ..., a, ...)`\n    Comparing the first component of each vector, we must have `b = k * a`.\n    Comparing a component from the vertical bar of the cross (within the canton), we must have `a = k * a`.\n    From `a = k*a`, if we choose `a != 0`, we get `k=1`.\n    Substituting `k=1` into `b = k*a`, we get `b = a`. This contradicts our assumption that `a != b`.\n    Therefore, if `a != b` and `a != 0`, the vectors `v_1` and `v_2` cannot be scalar multiples of each other, which means they are linearly independent.\n\nTo achieve the maximum rank, we can choose values for `a` and `b` that ensure linear independence. For example, we can choose `a=1` and `b=0`. In this case, `a != b` and `a != 0`, so the rank is 2.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe row space of the matrix is spanned by two distinct vectors. By choosing `a` and `b` appropriately (e.g., `a=1, b=0` or `a=2, b=1`), we can ensure these two vectors are linearly independent. Therefore, the maximal possible rank of the matrix is 2."
