    "Answering this question requires understanding the principles of Computed Tomography Imaging Spectrometry (CTIS).\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The goal is to construct a \"full spectral volume\" from a \"single image\". A spectral volume, also known as a hyperspectral data cube, is a 3D dataset with two spatial dimensions (x, y) and one spectral dimension (wavelength, λ). For each pixel (x, y) in a scene, it stores the entire spectrum of light. We want to capture this `I(x, y, λ)` data.\n\n2.  **Understand the Method:** The method is \"computed tomography\" (CT). Standard CT reconstructs a 3D object by taking multiple 2D projection images from different angles around the object. The fundamental principle of tomography, as described by the Fourier Slice Theorem, is that you need projections from multiple angles to reconstruct the original volume. A single projection provides incomplete information and is insufficient for reconstruction.\n\n3.  **Relate CT to Spectral Imaging:** In this context, the \"3D volume\" we want to reconstruct is not a spatial object, but the 3D spatio-spectral data cube `I(x, y, λ)`. The \"projections\" are the images formed on the 2D detector.\n\n4.  **Understand the Role of the Diffraction Grating:** A diffraction grating disperses light based on wavelength. When light from a scene passes through a grating, it creates a dispersed image on the detector. This dispersed image is effectively a projection of the `I(x, y, λ)` data cube onto the 2D detector plane. The orientation of the grating's lines determines the \"angle\" of this projection. For example, a grating with vertical lines will disperse light horizontally, creating a projection along one axis.\n\n5.  **Determine the Minimum Requirement:**\n    *   **Case 1: One Grating.** A single, simple (1D) diffraction grating disperses light in only one direction. This provides only *one* projection of the spectral data cube. As established by the principles of computed tomography, a single projection is fundamentally insufficient to reconstruct a 3D volume. You cannot solve for the `I(x, y, λ)` cube from this single view.\n    *   **Case 2: Two Gratings.** To perform a tomographic reconstruction, we need projections from at least two different angles. This can be achieved by using two gratings oriented in different directions (most commonly, perpendicular to each other, at 0° and 90°). These can be two separate 1D gratings or, more practically, combined into a single optical element called a 2D \"cross-grating\". This setup produces multiple dispersed images on the single detector (one for each diffraction order). For example, a 2D grating produces an undispersed central image (the 0,0 order) and multiple dispersed images (e.g., +1,0 order dispersed horizontally; 0,+1 order dispersed vertically; +1,+1 order dispersed diagonally, etc.). This set of multiple projections, captured in a single snapshot, provides the necessary data from different \"viewing angles\" to allow for a tomographic reconstruction of the spectral data cube. Although the reconstruction from only two primary angles might have artifacts, it is mathematically possible and the problem is no longer fundamentally unsolvable.\n\n### Careful Points:\n\n*   The question asks for the *minimum* number necessary, not the number required for a perfect or artifact-free reconstruction.\n*   The \"single image\" constraint means all projections must be generated and captured simultaneously on one detector. A 2D cross-grating (functionally equivalent to two 1D gratings) accomplishes this.\n*   While systems with three or more gratings exist and produce higher-quality results, the fundamental threshold for enabling tomographic reconstruction is crossed when going from one grating (impossible) to two (possible).\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nTo satisfy the multi-angle projection requirement of computed tomography, dispersion in at least two independent directions is necessary. This requires a minimum of two diffraction gratings (or a single 2D grating that functions as two). Therefore, 2 is the minimum number.\n\n<<<B>>>"
