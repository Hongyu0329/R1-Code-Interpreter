    "To determine the number of Triple Crown winners in MLB history, we will follow a step-by-step analysis.\n\n### Step 1: Define the Triple Crown\nThe batting Triple Crown in Major League Baseball is an achievement where a player leads their specific league (American League or National League) in three key offensive categories in the same season:\n1.  **Batting Average (BA)**\n2.  **Home Runs (HR)**\n3.  **Runs Batted In (RBI)**\n\n### Step 2: List the Triple Crown Winners by League\nWe need to compile a list of all players who have accomplished this feat in either the American League (AL) or the National League (NL). It's important to note that a player can win the Triple Crown more than once.\n\n**American League (AL) Winners:**\n*   **1901:** Nap Lajoie (Philadelphia Athletics)\n*   **1909:** Ty Cobb (Detroit Tigers)\n*   **1933:** Jimmie Foxx (Philadelphia Athletics)\n*   **1934:** Lou Gehrig (New York Yankees)\n*   **1942:** Ted Williams (Boston Red Sox)\n*   **1947:** Ted Williams (Boston Red Sox)\n*   **1956:** Mickey Mantle (New York Yankees)\n*   **1966:** Frank Robinson (Baltimore Orioles)\n*   **1967:** Carl Yastrzemski (Boston Red Sox)\n*   **2012:** Miguel Cabrera (Detroit Tigers)\n\n**National League (NL) Winners (including predecessor Major Leagues):**\n*   **1878:** Paul Hines (Providence Grays)\n*   **1887:** Tip O'Neill (St. Louis Browns, American Association*)\n*   **1894:** Hugh Duffy (Boston Beaneaters)\n*   **1912:** Heinie Zimmerman (Chicago Cubs)\n*   **1922:** Rogers Hornsby (St. Louis Cardinals)\n*   **1925:** Rogers Hornsby (St. Louis Cardinals)\n*   **1933:** Chuck Klein (Philadelphia Phillies)\n*   **1937:** Joe Medwick (St. Louis Cardinals)\n\n*The American Association is recognized by MLB as a Major League from that era.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Lists and Identify Careful Points\n*   **Multiple Winners:** Some players have won the Triple Crown more than once. Ted Williams won it twice in the American League, and Rogers Hornsby won it twice in the National League.\n*   **Distinct Winners:** The question asks \"how many... winners are there,\" which typically implies counting the number of unique individuals, not the total number of times the award has been won.\n*   **Pre-Modern Era:** The list includes winners from before the \"modern era\" (pre-1901). These are universally recognized by MLB and the Baseball Hall of Fame.\n\n### Step 4: Count the Number of Unique Winners\nNow, we will count the number of distinct players from both lists combined.\n\n**American League Unique Winners:**\n1.  Nap Lajoie\n2.  Ty Cobb\n3.  Jimmie Foxx\n4.  Lou Gehrig\n5.  Ted Williams\n6.  Mickey Mantle\n7.  Frank Robinson\n8.  Carl Yastrzemski\n9.  Miguel Cabrera\n**(Total: 9 unique players)**\n\n**National League Unique Winners:**\n1.  Paul Hines\n2.  Tip O'Neill\n3.  Hugh Duffy\n4.  Heinie Zimmerman\n5.  Rogers Hornsby\n6.  Chuck Klein\n7.  Joe Medwick\n**(Total: 7 unique players)**\n\nCombining both lists, there are no players who won a Triple Crown in both the AL and NL. Therefore, the total number of unique Triple Crown winners is the sum of the unique winners from each league.\n\nTotal Unique Winners = 9 (AL) + 7 (NL) = 16\n\n### Final Answer\nThere have been 16 different players who have won the MLB batting Triple Crown.\n\n<<<16>>>"
