    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question and answer choices.\n\n**Analysis of the Question**\n\nThe question asks for the mechanism that is \"most likely responsible for the retention and divergence of duplicate genes.\" This means we are looking for a process that accomplishes two things:\n1.  **Retention:** It prevents the extra gene copy from being lost from the genome over evolutionary time. The most common fate of a duplicate gene is its loss through the accumulation of disabling mutations (pseudogenization), so a specific mechanism is needed to retain it.\n2.  **Divergence:** It causes the original gene and its duplicate to become different from each other, either in their DNA sequence, their expression pattern, or their function.\n\nThe phrase \"most likely\" suggests we should choose the mechanism considered most common or the one that provides the most plausible general explanation for the large number of duplicate genes observed in eukaryotes.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis of the Answer Choices**\n\n1.  **A. Gene conversion:** Gene conversion is a non-reciprocal process where a DNA sequence replaces a homologous sequence, such that the sequences become identical. This process *homogenizes* gene families, making them more similar. It actively works *against* divergence. Therefore, this is not a mechanism for retention and divergence.\n\n2.  **B. Pseudogenization:** This is the process where a gene copy becomes non-functional due to the accumulation of mutations. This is the most common fate of a duplicated gene precisely because there is no selective pressure to maintain its function when another functional copy exists. While this leads to sequence divergence (the pseudogene's sequence changes rapidly), it is a mechanism of gene *loss*, not functional *retention*.\n\n3.  **C. Neofunctionalization:** In this model, one gene copy maintains the ancestral function, while the second copy is free to accumulate mutations. One of these mutations might luckily confer a new, beneficial function. This new function is then favored by natural selection, leading to the retention of the second copy. This model explains both retention (one copy for the old function, one for the new) and divergence (the new copy evolves a new function). It is a valid mechanism.\n\n4.  **D. Subfunctionalization:** This model (also known as the Duplication-Degeneration-Complementation or DDC model) proposes that the ancestral gene had multiple functions (or was expressed in multiple tissues). After duplication, each copy can accumulate mutations that disable different subfunctions. For instance, copy 1 loses the ability to function in tissue A but keeps its function in tissue B, while copy 2 loses its function in tissue B but keeps it in tissue A. Now, both gene copies are required to perform the full set of the original gene's functions. This \"division of labor\" ensures that both copies are retained by selection. This leads to both retention and divergence, as each copy specializes.\n\n5.  **E. Adaptive radiation:** This is a macroevolutionary process describing the rapid diversification of species from a common ancestor. While gene duplication can provide the genetic fuel for adaptive radiation, it is not, by itself, a molecular mechanism for retaining genes within a genome. This answer choice describes a pattern at the species level, not a mechanism at the gene level.\n\n**Comparison and Conclusion**\n\n*   Both neofunctionalization (C) and subfunctionalization (D) are accepted, valid mechanisms for the retention and divergence of duplicate genes.\n*   The key is to determine which is \"most likely.\" Neofunctionalization requires a rare event: a specific mutation that creates a new, beneficial function. In contrast, subfunctionalization relies on loss-of-function mutations, which are much more common.\n*   If an ancestral gene has a complex function or regulation, it is relatively easy for degenerative mutations to randomly knock out complementary parts in the two duplicates. Once this happens, selection will preserve both copies.\n*   Because subfunctionalization relies on more frequent mutational events (loss-of-function vs. gain-of-function), many scientists believe it is a more common pathway for the initial preservation of duplicate genes, creating a \"safe harbor\" from pseudogenization.\n\nTherefore, subfunctionalization is considered the most likely general mechanism responsible for the widespread retention of duplicate genes seen in eukaryotic genomes.\n\n<<<D>>>"
