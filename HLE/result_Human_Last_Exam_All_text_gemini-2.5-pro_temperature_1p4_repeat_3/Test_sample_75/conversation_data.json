    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the length of the Second Great War in StarCraft lore.\n\n### Step 1: Define the \"Second Great War\"\nThe term \"Second Great War\" is a fan-created but widely accepted name for the galactic conflict that spans the entirety of the *StarCraft II* trilogy. This war's central narrative is the rise of the fallen Xel'naga, Amon, and the united effort of the Terran, Zerg, and Protoss races to defeat him. The war begins with Amon's renewed influence and ends with his final destruction.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Start Date of the War\nThe war begins at the start of the *StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty* campaign. Lore and in-game timelines firmly place this in the year **2504**. This is four years after the end of the Brood War (which concluded in 2500). The first acts of the war are the renewed Zerg attacks on the Terran Dominion's fringe worlds.\n\n### Step 3: Identify the End Date of the War\nThe war concludes not at the end of the main *Legacy of the Void* campaign, but at the end of its three-mission epilogue, *Into the Void*. This is because the primary antagonist, Amon, is not permanently defeated until this epilogue.\n\n*   The main *Legacy of the Void* campaign, which culminates in the reclamation of the Protoss homeworld Aiur, takes place in the year **2506**.\n*   The opening cinematic of the epilogue campaign explicitly states that its events take place \"**two years after** we reclaimed our homeworld.\"\n*   Therefore, the final battle and the definitive end of the war occur in the year **2508** (2506 + 2 years = 2508).\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Total Duration\nWith a start date in the year 2504 and an end date in the year 2508, we can calculate the total duration of the conflict.\n\n*   **Start:** Sometime in 2504.\n*   **End:** Sometime in 2508.\n\nThe war spans across the years 2504, 2505, 2506, 2507 (a period of relative peace and rebuilding before the final confrontation), and 2508.\n\nTo calculate the elapsed time, let's assume a hypothetical start and end. If the war began in mid-2504 and ended in mid-2508, the duration would be exactly 4 years. However, the various campaigns and the significant two-year gap make it more likely that the duration is slightly more than 4 full years.\n\nFor example:\n*   Events of *Wings of Liberty* through *Legacy of the Void* (main) span from early 2504 to mid-2506. This is a duration of ~2.5 years.\n*   Add the two-year gap before the epilogue. The total time elapsed is now ~4.5 years.\n*   The epilogue itself is brief, so the total duration is approximately **4.5 years**.\n\n### Step 5: Round Up to the Nearest Year\nThe question asks for the duration to be rounded up. \"Rounding up\" means we must take the ceiling of the calculated duration.\n\n*   The duration is approximately 4.5 years.\n*   Rounding up any value greater than 4.0 (e.g., 4.1, 4.5, 4.9) results in the next highest integer.\n*   Therefore, rounding up 4.5 years gives a final answer of 5 years.\n\n### Careful Points Checklist:\n*   **Definition of the War:** Correctly identified as the full *StarCraft II* saga.\n*   **Start/End Points:** Correctly identified the start as *Wings of Liberty* (2504) and the true end as the *Into the Void* epilogue (2508). A common mistake is to end the war with the main *Legacy of the Void* campaign in 2506, which would lead to an incorrect result.\n*   **Timeline Gaps:** Accounted for the explicit \"two-year\" gap between the main campaign and the epilogue.\n*   **Rounding Instruction:** Correctly interpreted \"rounded up\" as a ceiling function, which is critical for the final answer.\n\n<<<5>>>"
