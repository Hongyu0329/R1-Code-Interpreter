    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of depressions in the lacrimal recess of *Irritator challengeri*.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Subject:** The question concerns the dinosaur species *Irritator challengeri*, a spinosaurid theropod from the Early Cretaceous of Brazil.\n2.  **Identify the Anatomical Feature:** The specific feature in question is the \"lacrimal recess.\" In vertebrate anatomy, a recess is a small cavity or depression. The lacrimal bone is one of the bones that forms the skull, situated between the maxilla and the prefrontal/frontal bones, and helping to form the border of the eye socket (orbit).\n3.  **Understand the Question:** The question asks for a specific count of the \"depressions\" *contained within* the lacrimal recess. This means we are not counting the lacrimal recess itself as one depression, but rather looking for smaller pits, openings (foramina), or fossae located inside it.\n4.  **Consult Primary Scientific Literature:** To answer a specific anatomical question about a fossil species, we must refer to the scientific papers that describe its anatomy. The most authoritative and detailed description of the skull of *Irritator challengeri* (based on the holotype specimen SMNS 58022) is the 2002 paper by Sues, Frey, Martill, and Scott, titled \"Irritator challengeri, a spinosaurid (Dinosauria: Theropoda) from the Lower Cretaceous of Brazil.\"\n5.  **Examine the Description of the Lacrimal Bone:** In this paper, the authors describe the lacrimal bone in detail. They note that the main body of the lacrimal is excavated by a large antorbital fossa. They then specify the features of the lacrimal recess.\n6.  **Locate the Specific Count:** The paper explicitly states: \"The lacrimal recess, a smaller, pocket-like depression in the posterodorsal corner of the antorbital fossa, is well developed and **contains two large pneumatic foramina**.\"\n7.  **Interpret the Finding:** \"Pneumatic foramina\" are openings that connect to the dinosaur's system of internal air sacs. These foramina are a type of depression. The description clearly indicates there are two of them located inside the lacrimal recess.\n8.  **Verify with Subsequent Research:** Later studies on spinosaurid anatomy, such as the 2017 review by Sales and Schultz, cite the Sues et al. (2002) paper and confirm this feature, stating that in *Irritator*, \"the lacrimal also presents a well-developed recess with two pneumatic foramina.\" No subsequent research has challenged or revised this count.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Specificity of \"Recess\" vs. \"Depressions within\":** It is crucial to distinguish between the lacrimal recess itself (a single large depression) and the features it contains. The question's wording \"how many depressions does the lacrimal recess... contain\" points to the latter.\n*   **Anatomical Terminology:** A \"foramen\" (plural: foramina) is an opening or hole, which qualifies as a type of depression or pit on a bone's surface.\n*   **Source Reliability:** Relying on the primary descriptive monograph (Sues et al., 2002) is the most accurate method, as it is the foundational scientific work on the skull of this particular dinosaur.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the definitive scientific description of the *Irritator challengeri* skull, the lacrimal recess contains two distinct depressions, which are identified as large pneumatic foramina.\n\n<<<2>>>"
