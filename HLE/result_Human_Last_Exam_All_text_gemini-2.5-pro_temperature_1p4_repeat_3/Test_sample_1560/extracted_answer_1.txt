The final state of the system is probabilistic and depends on the measurement outcome on ququint A. The possibilities are as follows:
- With probability 2/10, the measurement outcome is $|0\rangle_A$, and the system collapses to the state $|0\rangle_A \otimes \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|1\rangle_B+|3\rangle_B)$.
- With probability 2/10, the measurement outcome is $|1\rangle_A$, and the system collapses to the state $|1\rangle_A \otimes \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rangle_B+|2\rangle_B)$.
- With probability 3/10, the measurement outcome is $|2\rangle_A$, and the system collapses to the state $|2\rangle_A \otimes \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}(|0\rangle_B+|3\rangle_B+|4\rangle_B)$.
- With probability 2/10, the measurement outcome is $|3\rangle_A$, and the system collapses to the state $|3\rangle_A \otimes \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|1\rangle_B+|4\rangle_B)$.
- With probability 1/10, the measurement outcome is $|4\rangle_A$, and the system collapses to the state $|4\rangle_A \otimes |2\rangle_B$.
