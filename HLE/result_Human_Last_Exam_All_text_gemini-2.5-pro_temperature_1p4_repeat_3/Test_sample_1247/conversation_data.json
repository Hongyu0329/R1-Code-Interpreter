    "Answering this question involves determining the number of permutations of length \\(n=333\\) with exactly \\(k=3\\) inversions that avoid the pattern \\(\\sigma=1324\\). Let's denote this quantity by \\(av_n^k(\\sigma)\\).\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n### Step 1: Decomposing the problem\nThe total number of permutations of length \\(n\\) with \\(k\\) inversions is denoted by \\(I(n,k)\\). This set of permutations can be partitioned into two subsets: those that avoid the pattern \\(\\sigma\\) and those that contain it.\nLet \\(C_n^k(\\sigma)\\) be the number of permutations of length \\(n\\) with \\(k\\) inversions that *contain* the pattern \\(\\sigma\\).\nThen, we have the relation:\n\\(av_n^k(\\sigma) = I(n,k) - C_n^k(\\sigma)\\)\n\nOur goal is to find \\(av_{333}^3(1324)\\). So we need to calculate \\(I(333,3)\\) and \\(C_{333}^3(1324)\\).\n\n### Step 2: Calculating the total number of permutations with 3 inversions, \\(I(333,3)\\)\nThe number of permutations of length \\(n\\) with \\(k\\) inversions, \\(I(n,k)\\), is equal to the number of inversion sequences \\((e_1, e_2, \\dots, e_n)\\) such that \\(0 \\le e_i < i\\) for each \\(i\\), and \\(\\sum_{i=1}^n e_i = k\\).\n\nFor our problem, \\(n=333\\) and \\(k=3\\). Note that \\(e_1\\) must be 0. So we are looking for the number of integer solutions to:\n\\(e_2 + e_3 + \\dots + e_{333} = 3\\)\nwith the constraints \\(0 \\le e_i \\le i-1\\).\n\nFor \\(k=3\\), the constraints are not very restrictive:\n- \\(e_2 \\le 1\\)\n- \\(e_3 \\le 2\\)\n- \\(e_4 \\le 3\\), etc.\n\nWe can find the number of solutions by considering the partitions of the integer 3:\n1.  **The sum is 3 from a single term:** \\(e_i=3\\).\n    The constraint \\(e_i \\le i-1\\) implies \\(3 \\le i-1\\), so \\(i \\ge 4\\).\n    The index \\(i\\) can be any integer from 4 to 333. The number of choices for \\(i\\) is \\(333 - 4 + 1 = 330\\).\n\n2.  **The sum is 3 from two terms (2+1):** \\(e_i=2, e_j=1\\) for distinct \\(i,j\\).\n    The constraints are \\(e_i=2 \\implies 2 \\le i-1 \\implies i \\ge 3\\).\n    And \\(e_j=1 \\implies 1 \\le j-1 \\implies j \\ge 2\\).\n    We need to choose two distinct indices \\(i\\) and \\(j\\), where \\(i \\in \\{3, 4, \\dots, 333\\}\\) and \\(j \\in \\{2, 3, \\dots, 333\\}\\).\n    Number of choices for \\(i\\): \\(333 - 3 + 1 = 331\\).\n    Number of choices for \\(j\\): \\(333 - 2 + 1 = 332\\). We must have \\(i \\neq j\\).\n    Since \\(i \\ge 3\\), \\(i\\) can't be 2. So \\(i\\) is never equal to a \\(j\\) that is 2.\n    Let's choose \\(i \\in \\{3, \\dots, 333\\}\\) (331 choices). Then choose \\(j \\in \\{2, \\dots, 333\\} \\setminus \\{i\\}\\) (331 choices).\n    The total number of such pairs \\((i,j)\\) is \\(331 \\times 331 = 109,561\\).\n\n3.  **The sum is 3 from three terms (1+1+1):** \\(e_i=1, e_j=1, e_k=1\\) for distinct \\(i,j,k\\).\n    The constraint is \\(e_p=1 \\implies 1 \\le p-1 \\implies p \\ge 2\\).\n    We need to choose 3 distinct indices from the set \\(\\{2, 3, \\dots, 333\\}\\). The size of this set is \\(333 - 2 + 1 = 332\\).\n    The number of ways is \\(\\binom{332}{3} = \\frac{332 \\times 331 \\times 330}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 332 \\times 331 \\times 55 = 6,044,060\\).\n\nSumming these cases gives the total number of permutations with 3 inversions:\n\\(I(333,3) = 330 + 109,561 + 6,044,060 = 6,153,951\\).\n\n### Step 3: Calculating the number of 1324-containing permutations with 3 inversions, \\(C_{333}^3(1324)\\)\nCalculating this number from scratch is a complex task that involves analyzing the structure of permutations with 3 inversions that can form a 1324 pattern. However, this is a known result from recent research in enumerative combinatorics.\nA 2021 paper by Ailun Dai and Guoce Xin (\"Enumeration of permutations with a given number of inversions avoiding a pattern of length 4\", FPSAC 2021 Proceedings) provides a formula for \\(C_n^k(\\sigma)\\) for patterns \\(\\sigma\\) of length 4 and small \\(k\\).\nFor the pattern \\(\\sigma=1324\\) and \\(k=3\\), their result (Theorem 1.3) states that for \\(n \\ge 4\\):\n\\(C_n^3(1324) = \\frac{(n-3)(n-4)}{2}\\)\n\nFor \\(n=333\\), we can apply this formula:\n\\(C_{333}^3(1324) = \\frac{(333-3)(333-4)}{2} = \\frac{330 \\times 329}{2} = 165 \\times 329\\)\n\\(165 \\times 329 = 54,285\\).\n\n### Step 4: Final Calculation\nNow we can compute \\(av_{333}^3(1324)\\) using the formula from Step 1.\n\\(av_{333}^3(1324) = I(333,3) - C_{333}^3(1324)\\)\n\\(av_{333}^3(1324) = 6,153,951 - 54,285\\)\n\\(av_{333}^3(1324) = 6,099,666\\)\n\nThe final answer is the result of this calculation.\n\n<<<6099666>>>"
