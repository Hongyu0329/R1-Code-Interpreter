No. The mathematical framework of quantum mechanics (Hilbert spaces, operators, differential equations) is designed to model physical reality and make probabilistic predictions about measurable quantities. Gödel's ontological proof is a formal argument in modal logic, dealing with abstract concepts like "positive properties" and "necessary existence." There is a fundamental category error in trying to apply one to the other; the concepts and tools of quantum mechanics cannot be used to represent or manipulate the metaphysical concepts required for Gödel's proof.
