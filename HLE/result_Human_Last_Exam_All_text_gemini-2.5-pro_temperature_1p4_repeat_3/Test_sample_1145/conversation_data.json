    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the probability.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**1. Define the System and State**\n*   The system is a particle in a one-dimensional (1D) box of length `a`. The box extends from `x = 0` to `x = a`.\n*   We are interested in the quantum state with principal quantum number `n = 2`.\n\n**2. Write the Wavefunction and Probability Density**\n*   The normalized wavefunction for a particle in a 1D box is given by:\n    `ψ_n(x) = sqrt(2/a) * sin(nπx / a)`\n*   For the state `n = 2`, the wavefunction is:\n    `ψ_2(x) = sqrt(2/a) * sin(2πx / a)`\n*   The probability density, `P(x)`, which represents the probability per unit length of finding the particle at a position `x`, is the square of the magnitude of the wavefunction:\n    `P(x) = |ψ_2(x)|^2 = (2/a) * sin^2(2πx / a)`\n\n**3. Set Up the Probability Integral**\n*   We need to find the probability that the particle is located in the interval from `x₁ = 0.495a` to `x₂ = 0.505a`.\n*   This probability is found by integrating the probability density function over this interval:\n    `Prob = ∫[from x₁ to x₂] P(x) dx`\n    `Prob = ∫[from 0.495a to 0.505a] (2/a) * sin^2(2πx / a) dx`\n\n**4. Analyze the Function and the Interval**\n*   The interval `[0.495a, 0.505a]` is centered at `x = 0.5a`.\n*   Let's evaluate the probability density at the center of the interval, `x = 0.5a`:\n    `P(0.5a) = (2/a) * sin^2(2π(0.5a) / a) = (2/a) * sin^2(π) = (2/a) * 0^2 = 0`\n*   This point, `x = a/2`, is a **node** for the `n=2` state, meaning the probability of finding the particle exactly at the center of the box is zero.\n*   The interval of interest is very small (`Δx = 0.505a - 0.495a = 0.01a`) and centered on this node. Therefore, we expect the probability to be very small, but not exactly zero.\n\n**5. Solve the Integral**\nSince the interval is very small, we can use an approximation. Let's define a new variable `δ = x - 0.5a`. This centers our coordinate system at the node.\n*   When `x = 0.495a`, `δ = -0.005a`.\n*   When `x = 0.505a`, `δ = +0.005a`.\n*   `x = 0.5a + δ` and `dx = dδ`.\n\nSubstitute this into the integrand:\n`sin^2(2πx / a) = sin^2(2π(0.5a + δ) / a) = sin^2(π + 2πδ / a)`\nUsing the identity `sin(π + θ) = -sin(θ)`, we get:\n`sin^2(π + 2πδ / a) = [-sin(2πδ / a)]^2 = sin^2(2πδ / a)`\n\nFor a small angle `u`, `sin(u) ≈ u`. Here, `u = 2πδ / a` is very small over our interval.\nSo, `sin^2(2πδ / a) ≈ (2πδ / a)^2 = 4π²δ² / a²`.\n\nNow we can write the integral in terms of `δ`:\n`Prob ≈ ∫[from -0.005a to 0.005a] (2/a) * (4π²δ² / a²) dδ`\n`Prob ≈ (8π² / a³) ∫[from -0.005a to 0.005a] δ² dδ`\n\nNow, perform the integration:\n`Prob ≈ (8π² / a³) * [δ³/3]` evaluated from `-0.005a` to `0.005a`\n`Prob ≈ (8π² / (3a³)) * [(0.005a)³ - (-0.005a)³]`\n`Prob ≈ (8π² / (3a³)) * [2 * (0.005a)³]`\n`Prob ≈ (16π² / (3a³)) * (0.005)³ * a³`\n\nThe `a³` terms cancel out:\n`Prob ≈ (16π² / 3) * (0.005)³`\n`Prob ≈ (16π² / 3) * (1.25 × 10⁻⁷)`\n\n**6. Calculate the Final Numerical Value**\nUsing `π² ≈ 9.8696`:\n`Prob ≈ (16 * 9.8696 / 3) * (1.25 × 10⁻⁷)`\n`Prob ≈ (157.9136 / 3) * (1.25 × 10⁻⁷)`\n`Prob ≈ 52.638 * (1.25 × 10⁻⁷)`\n`Prob ≈ 65.797 × 10⁻⁷`\n`Prob ≈ 6.58 × 10⁻⁶` or `0.00000658`\n\n### **Careful Points**\n\n1.  **State Identification:** Ensure you are using `n=2`, not the ground state `n=1`. The location of nodes and antinodes is different for each state.\n2.  **Probability vs. Wavefunction:** The probability is proportional to the square of the wavefunction, `|ψ|²`, not the wavefunction itself.\n3.  **Node at the Center:** For `n=2`, there is a node at `x=a/2`. A simple approximation like `P ≈ P(center) × Δx` would incorrectly yield zero. The probability is small but non-zero because the interval has a finite width.\n4.  **Approximation Validity:** The small-angle approximation `sin(u) ≈ u` is valid because the argument `u = 2πδ/a` is at most `2π(0.005a)/a = 0.01π ≈ 0.0314` radians, which is very small.\n5.  **Units:** The probability is a dimensionless quantity. The `a` (length) dependence correctly cancels out during the calculation.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nThe probability of finding the particle in the interval from `0.495a` to `0.505a` for the `n=2` state is approximately `6.58 × 10⁻⁶`.\n\n<<<6.58e-6>>>"
