    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $N = 36036$ and order $6$.\n\n**Step 1: Prime Factorization of the Conductor**\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of $N$:\n$N = 36036 = 36 \\times 1000 + 36 = 36 \\times 1001$\n$36 = 6^2 = (2 \\cdot 3)^2 = 2^2 \\cdot 3^2$\n$1001 = 7 \\times 143 = 7 \\times 11 \\times 13$\nSo, the prime factorization of $N$ is $N = 2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 13$.\n\n**Step 2: Decomposition of Dirichlet Characters**\nA Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $N$ is primitive if and only if it can be uniquely expressed as a product of primitive Dirichlet characters with conductors being the prime power factors of $N$.\nLet $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\chi_3 \\chi_4 \\chi_5$, where:\n*   $\\chi_1$ is a primitive character modulo $N_1 = 2^2 = 4$.\n*   $\\chi_2$ is a primitive character modulo $N_2 = 3^2 = 9$.\n*   $\\chi_3$ is a primitive character modulo $N_3 = 7$.\n*   $\\chi_4$ is a primitive character modulo $N_4 = 11$.\n*   $\\chi_5$ is a primitive character modulo $N_5 = 13$.\n\nThe conductor of $\\chi$ is $\\text{cond}(\\chi) = \\text{cond}(\\chi_1) \\text{cond}(\\chi_2) \\text{cond}(\\chi_3) \\text{cond}(\\chi_4) \\text{cond}(\\chi_5) = 4 \\cdot 9 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 13 = N$.\nThe order of $\\chi$ is given by $\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_1), \\text{ord}(\\chi_2), \\text{ord}(\\chi_3), \\text{ord}(\\chi_4), \\text{ord}(\\chi_5))$.\n\nWe are looking for the number of such characters $\\chi$ for which $\\text{ord}(\\chi) = 6$.\n\n**Step 3: Finding Primitive Characters for Each Factor**\nFor the order of $\\chi$ to be 6, the order of each component character $\\chi_i$, denoted by $o_i = \\text{ord}(\\chi_i)$, must be a divisor of 6. Let's count the number of primitive characters for each factor $N_i$ whose order divides 6.\n\n*   **For $N_1 = 4$**: The group of characters modulo 4 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z})^* \\cong C_2$. There is one principal character (conductor 1) and one non-principal character. This non-principal character is primitive, and its order is 2. Since $2|6$, there is **1** choice for $\\chi_1$. Its order is $o_1=2$.\n\n*   **For $N_2 = 9$**: The group of characters modulo 9 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/9\\mathbb{Z})^* \\cong C_6$. The total number of characters is $\\phi(9) = 6$. Characters modulo 9 are primitive if they are not induced from characters modulo 3. There are $\\phi(3)=2$ characters modulo 3. Thus, there are $6-2=4$ primitive characters modulo 9. The orders of the 6 characters are 1, 2, 3, 3, 6, 6. The non-primitive ones (induced from mod 3) have orders 1 and 2. So the primitive characters have orders 3 (two characters) and 6 (two characters). Both 3 and 6 divide 6. So there are **4** choices for $\\chi_2$.\n\n*   **For $N_3 = 7$**: For a prime conductor $p$, all non-principal characters are primitive. The number of such characters is $\\phi(7)-1=5$. The group $(\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z})^*$ is isomorphic to $C_6$. The orders of the primitive characters are the divisors of 6 greater than 1, which are 2, 3, 6. The number of characters of each order is given by Euler's totient function: $\\phi(2)=1$, $\\phi(3)=2$, $\\phi(6)=2$. All these orders (2, 3, 6) divide 6. The total number of choices for $\\chi_3$ is $1+2+2 = \\textbf{5}$.\n\n*   **For $N_4 = 11$**: This is a prime conductor, so primitive characters are the non-principal ones. The group $(\\mathbb{Z}/11\\mathbb{Z})^*$ is isomorphic to $C_{10}$. The order $o_4$ of a primitive character $\\chi_4$ must divide 10. For $\\text{lcm}(\\dots)$ to be 6, $o_4$ must also divide 6. The only common divisor of 10 and 6 greater than 1 is 2. So, $o_4$ must be 2. The number of characters of order 2 is $\\phi(2)=1$. So there is **1** choice for $\\chi_4$.\n\n*   **For $N_5 = 13$**: This is a prime conductor. The group $(\\mathbb{Z}/13\\mathbb{Z})^*$ is isomorphic to $C_{12}$. The order $o_5$ must divide 12 and 6. The common divisors greater than 1 are 2, 3, 6. The number of characters for each order is $\\phi(2)=1$, $\\phi(3)=2$, $\\phi(6)=2$. The total number of choices for $\\chi_5$ is $1+2+2 = \\textbf{5}$.\n\n**Step 4: Combining the Components**\nWe need to find the number of tuples $(\\chi_1, \\chi_2, \\chi_3, \\chi_4, \\chi_5)$ that can be formed from the choices identified above, such that their combined order is exactly 6.\nThe order is $\\text{lcm}(o_1, o_2, o_3, o_4, o_5)$. For this to be 6, we need two conditions:\n1.  All orders $o_i$ must divide 6. (This is already satisfied by our selection of characters).\n2.  The set of orders $\\{o_1, o_2, o_3, o_4, o_5\\}$ must contain at least one order divisible by 2 and at least one order divisible by 3.\n\nLet's check these conditions:\n*   **Divisibility by 2**: For any choice, the order of $\\chi_1$ is $o_1=2$. So, $\\text{lcm}(o_1, \\dots, o_5)$ is always divisible by 2.\n*   **Divisibility by 3**: For any choice, the order of $\\chi_2$ is either 3 or 6. Both are divisible by 3. So, $\\text{lcm}(o_1, \\dots, o_5)$ is always divisible by 3.\n\nSince the lcm is always divisible by 2 and 3, it is always divisible by $\\text{lcm}(2,3)=6$.\nAs established in Step 3, all possible component characters have orders that divide 6. Therefore, their lcm must also divide 6.\nAny character $\\chi$ formed by these components will have an order that is both a multiple of 6 and a divisor of 6. Thus, its order must be exactly 6.\n\n**Step 5: Final Calculation**\nThe total number of primitive characters of conductor $N$ and order 6 is the total number of ways to choose the component characters. We multiply the number of choices for each component:\nNumber of characters = (Choices for $\\chi_1$) $\\times$ (Choices for $\\chi_2$) $\\times$ (Choices for $\\chi_3$) $\\times$ (Choices for $\\chi_4$) $\\times$ (Choices for $\\chi_5$)\nNumber of characters = $1 \\times 4 \\times 5 \\times 1 \\times 5 = 100$.\n\nThere are 100 such characters."
