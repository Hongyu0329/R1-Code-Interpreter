    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the worst suited jack to open from the button.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the Scenario:**\n    *   **Position:** Button (BTN). This is the last position to act preflop before the blinds. It's the most profitable position to steal blinds from, allowing us to play the widest range of hands.\n    *   **Action:** Opening to 2.5x. This is a standard opening size.\n    *   **Game Conditions:** 100 Big Blinds (BB) deep, rake-free cash game.\n        *   **100BB Deep:** This is the standard stack depth, meaning postflop play is very relevant.\n        *   **Rake-Free:** This is a critical detail. Rake is the fee the house takes from a pot. It significantly reduces the profitability of playing marginal hands. In a rake-free environment, the threshold for a hand to be profitably opened is much lower. We can open a wider range of hands than in a typical online or live game where rake is present.\n\n2.  **Identify the Hand Category:**\n    *   The question specifies \"suited jacks\" (JXs). This category includes, in descending order of strength: JTs, J9s, J8s, J7s, J6s, J5s, J4s, J3s, and J2s.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Hands Within the Category:**\n    *   The value of these hands comes from three main sources:\n        1.  **High Card Strength:** The Jack gives the hand decent high card value.\n        2.  **Flush Potential:** Being suited allows the hand to make flushes, which are very strong hands. This is the primary value driver for the weaker hands in this category.\n        3.  **Straight Potential:** The second card (the \"kicker\") determines the hand's ability to connect and make straights.\n    *   **Ranking:**\n        *   **JTs:** This is the strongest hand in the group. It's a Broadway hand that can make the nut straight and strong flushes.\n        *   **J9s, J8s:** These are strong suited connectors/gappers. They have excellent playability and can make strong straights and flushes.\n        *   **J7s, J6s, J5s:** These hands have decreasing straight potential but retain good flush potential. They are still easily strong enough to open from the button.\n        *   **J4s, J3s, J2s:** These are the weakest hands in the category. Their straight potential is minimal. For example, J2s can't make a straight using both cards without a specific board like A-3-4-5. Their value is almost entirely derived from their flush potential and the high card value of the Jack.\n\n4.  **Determine the Cutoff Point for Opening:**\n    *   The question asks for the \"worst\" suited Jack you *should* open. This implies we are looking for the hand at the very bottom of the opening range within the JXs category.\n    *   In a standard GTO (Game Theory Optimal) strategy for a **100BB rake-free** game, the button's opening range is extremely wide, often approaching 50% or more. This is because the incentive to steal the blinds with no rake penalty is very high.\n    *   A typical rake-free button opening range includes *all* suited hands. This is because even a hand like 32s has just enough equity (from flushes, straights, pairs) and fold equity (the chance the blinds fold preflop) to be a slightly profitable open over folding.\n    *   Since the opening range includes all suited hands, it must also include all suited Jacks.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   We have established that all hands from JTs down to J2s are considered standard opens in this specific rake-free scenario.\n    *   The \"worst\" of these hands is the one with the lowest inherent equity and playability.\n    *   Comparing the bottom contenders, J2s is objectively weaker than J3s, which is weaker than J4s. The \"2\" kicker provides virtually no straight connectivity with the Jack.\n    *   Therefore, the worst suited jack that you should still open from the button is **J2s**.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Rake is Key:** The \"rake-free\" parameter is the most important part of the question. In a typical game with 5% rake, the most marginal hands like J3s or J2s might become folds or mixed strategies (opening only a fraction of the time). Without rake, their small theoretical profit becomes reality.\n*   **Opponent Tendencies:** This analysis assumes GTO play against unknown or competent opponents in the blinds. If the blinds are extremely tight and fold too often, you could open even wider. If they are very aggressive and 3-bet frequently, you might need to tighten up slightly.\n*   **\"Should Open\":** This phrasing implies we are looking for a hand that is standard to play, not a hand that is on the borderline of folding. In this specific game setup, J2s is a standard open.\n\n<<<J2s>>>"
