No, it is not possible. The mathematical framework of quantum mechanics is designed to model the physical, empirical universe and lacks the concepts and logical structure necessary to engage with the metaphysical axioms and modal logic of GÃ¶del's ontological proof. Key terms in the proof, such as "positive property" and "necessary existence," have no meaningful equivalent within the mathematics of quantum mechanics.
