    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of self-intersection points for the curve given by the parametric equations x(t) = cos(9t) and y(t) = sin(5t).\n\n**Step 1: Identify the type of curve.**\nThe curve defined by the parametric equations x(t) = A cos(ω₁t + δ₁) and y(t) = B sin(ω₂t + δ₂) is known as a Lissajous curve. In this case, we have A=1, B=1, ω₁=9, ω₂=5, δ₁=0, and δ₂=0. The ratio of the frequencies ω₁/ω₂ = 9/5 is a rational number, so the curve is closed and periodic.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the condition for a self-intersection point.**\nA self-intersection point is a point (x, y) on the curve that is reached at two or more different times. That is, we are looking for the number of distinct points (x₀, y₀) for which there exist at least two distinct time values, t₁ and t₂, such that:\nx(t₁) = x(t₂) = x₀\ny(t₁) = y(t₂) = y₀\n\n**Step 3: Determine the period of the curve.**\nThe period of x(t) = cos(9t) is T_x = 2π/9.\nThe period of y(t) = sin(5t) is T_y = 2π/5.\nThe curve completes a full cycle over the least common multiple (LCM) of the individual periods.\nT = LCM(2π/9, 2π/5) = 2π * LCM(1/9, 1/5) = 2π / GCD(9, 5) = 2π / 1 = 2π.\nSo, we need to find the number of self-intersections for t in the interval [0, 2π).\n\n**Step 4: Use the standard formula for Lissajous curve self-intersections.**\nFor Lissajous curves of the form x(t) = cos(nt) and y(t) = sin(mt), where n and m are coprime integers, there are established formulas for the number of self-intersection points (also called nodes or double points).\n\nThe applicable formula depends on the parity of n and m.\n- If one of n, m is even and the other is odd, the number of self-intersections is (n-1)(m-1)/2.\n- If both n and m are odd, the number of self-intersections is also (n-1)(m-1)/2. (This case has higher symmetry, but the formula for the number of distinct intersection points remains the same for generic cases like this).\n\nIn our problem, n=9 and m=5.\n- Both n and m are integers.\n- They are coprime, as GCD(9, 5) = 1.\n- Both n=9 and m=5 are odd.\n\n**Step 5: Apply the formula to the given parameters.**\nUsing the formula for the case where n and m are both odd:\nNumber of self-intersections = (n - 1)(m - 1) / 2\nNumber of self-intersections = (9 - 1)(5 - 1) / 2\nNumber of self-intersections = (8)(4) / 2\nNumber of self-intersections = 32 / 2\nNumber of self-intersections = 16\n\n**Careful Points:**\n1.  **Formula Validity:** One must be sure that the formula applies. This formula is standard for this type of Lissajous curve, which does not pass through the origin (since cos(9t)=0 and sin(5t)=0 have no common solutions for t) and has no intersections on the boundary of its bounding box [-1,1]x[-1,1]. These conditions hold true for this curve.\n2.  **Coprimality:** The frequencies must be coprime. If they are not, say (9,6), we would first reduce the ratio to lowest terms (3,2) and analyze the curve x=cos(3t), y=sin(2t). In this problem, 9 and 5 are already coprime.\n3.  **Parametrization:** The formula holds for the x=cos(nt), y=sin(mt) parametrization. Other parametrizations, like x=sin(nt), y=sin(mt), may have different numbers of intersections depending on how the curve passes through the origin or its boundary. The given curve fits the standard form for which the formula is well-established.\n\nThe step-by-step analysis using the established formula for Lissajous curves provides the number of self-intersection points.\n\nFinal calculation:\nn = 9, m = 5\nNumber of self-intersections = (9 - 1)(5 - 1) / 2 = 8 * 4 / 2 = 16."
