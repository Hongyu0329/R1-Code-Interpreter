    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand and Deconstruct the Parametric Curve**\n\nThe curve is defined by the parametric equations $x=\\cos t$ and $y=b\\sin t$ for $t \\in [0, 2\\pi)$. The parameter $b$ has a piecewise definition:\n*   For $t \\in [0, \\pi]$, $b=1$.\n*   For $t \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$, $b=5$.\n\nWe need to analyze the shape of the curve in these two intervals.\n\n**2. Analyze the First Part of the Curve: $t \\in [0, \\pi]$**\n\nIn this interval, $b=1$. The equations become:\n*   $x = \\cos t$\n*   $y = \\sin t$\n\nThis is the standard parametrization of a unit circle, $x^2 + y^2 = 1$. Let's determine the range of coordinates traced:\n*   As $t$ goes from $0$ to $\\pi$, $x = \\cos t$ goes from $\\cos(0)=1$ to $\\cos(\\pi)=-1$.\n*   As $t$ goes from $0$ to $\\pi$, $y = \\sin t$ starts at $0$, increases to a maximum of $1$ (at $t=\\pi/2$), and returns to $0$.\n*   So, this part of the curve traces the **upper semi-circle** of the unit circle, with $x \\in [-1, 1]$ and $y \\in [0, 1]$.\n\n**3. Analyze the Second Part of the Curve: $t \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$**\n\nIn this interval, $b=5$. The equations become:\n*   $x = \\cos t$\n*   $y = 5\\sin t$\n\nThis is the parametrization of an ellipse. We can find its Cartesian equation: $x^2 + (y/5)^2 = \\cos^2 t + \\sin^2 t = 1$. This is an ellipse centered at the origin with a semi-horizontal axis of 1 and a semi-vertical axis of 5. Let's determine the range of coordinates traced:\n*   As $t$ goes from $\\pi$ to $2\\pi$, $x = \\cos t$ goes from $\\cos(\\pi)=-1$ to $\\cos(2\\pi)=1$.\n*   As $t$ goes from $\\pi$ to $2\\pi$, $y = 5\\sin t$ is always negative (or zero). It goes from $0$ down to a minimum of $-5$ (at $t=3\\pi/2$) and back to $0$.\n*   So, this part of the curve traces the **lower semi-ellipse**, with $x \\in [-1, 1]$ and $y \\in [-5, 0]$.\n\n**4. Determine the Bounding Box of the Entire Figure**\n\nTo find the smallest square that encloses the figure, we first need to find the overall extent of the figure by combining the ranges from both parts.\n*   **Total x-range:** The union of $x \\in [-1, 1]$ and $x \\in [-1, 1]$ is $x \\in [-1, 1]$. The total width of the figure is $W = x_{max} - x_{min} = 1 - (-1) = 2$.\n*   **Total y-range:** The union of $y \\in [0, 1]$ and $y \\in [-5, 0]$ is $y \\in [-5, 1]$. The total height of the figure is $H = y_{max} - y_{min} = 1 - (-5) = 6$.\n\nThe figure is contained within an axis-aligned rectangle of width 2 and height 6.\n\n**5. Find the Smallest Enclosing Square**\n\nThe problem now is to find the area of the smallest square that can contain this 2x6 rectangle. A common mistake is to assume the square must be axis-aligned. The term \"smallest square\" implies we can rotate it to find a better fit.\n\n*   **Axis-Aligned Case:** If the square's sides are parallel to the coordinate axes, its side length must be at least as large as the maximum dimension of the rectangle. Side length $s_{aligned} = \\max(W, H) = \\max(2, 6) = 6$. The area would be $6^2 = 36$.\n\n*   **Rotated Case:** It is a known geometric result that the smallest square enclosing a rectangle of dimensions $W \\times H$ is tilted at $45^\\circ$ to the rectangle. The side length, $s$, of this square can be found by considering the projection of the rectangle onto a line rotated by $45^\\circ$. The side length is given by the formula:\n    $s = \\frac{W+H}{\\sqrt{2}}$\n    Substituting our values $W=2$ and $H=6$:\n    $s = \\frac{2+6}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{8}{\\sqrt{2}} = 4\\sqrt{2}$.\n\n**6. Calculate the Final Area**\n\nThe side length of the smallest possible enclosing square is $s = 4\\sqrt{2}$. The area of this square is:\nArea $= s^2 = (4\\sqrt{2})^2 = 16 \\times 2 = 32$.\n\nComparing the two cases, the area of the rotated square (32) is smaller than the area of the axis-aligned square (36). Therefore, the area of the smallest square that outcircles the figure is 32.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Piecewise Definition:** The change in the parameter $b$ is the most critical detail, as it creates a composite figure from two different conic sections.\n*   **Range of `t`:** The intervals for `t` determine which part of the circle/ellipse is traced (upper vs. lower half).\n*   **Bounding Box:** Correctly calculating the overall width and height of the figure is essential.\n*   **\"Smallest Square\" Interpretation:** The crucial step is realizing that the enclosing square is not necessarily axis-aligned. Allowing for rotation leads to the true minimum area. If the problem intended an axis-aligned square, it would typically specify that. The term \"outcircles\" doesn't have a standard definition that restricts orientation.\n\n### Final Answer Acquisition\n\n1.  **Figure Shape:** An upper unit semi-circle joined with a lower semi-ellipse with axes 1 and 5.\n2.  **Bounding Box Dimensions:** Width = 2, Height = 6.\n3.  **Problem Reduction:** Find the smallest square enclosing a 2x6 rectangle.\n4.  **Optimal Square Side:** $s = (W+H)/\\sqrt{2} = (2+6)/\\sqrt{2} = 4\\sqrt{2}$.\n5.  **Optimal Square Area:** Area = $s^2 = (4\\sqrt{2})^2 = 32$.\n\n<<<32>>>"
