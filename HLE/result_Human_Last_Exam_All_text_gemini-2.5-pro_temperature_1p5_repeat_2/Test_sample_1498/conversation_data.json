    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Poem and the Question:** The question asks for the specific range of verses (bayt) in the poem *'Aqeedat al-'Awaam* where the author, Sayyid Ahmad al-Marzuqi, lists the names of the 25 prophets that a Muslim is obligated to know by name. The poem is a basic matn (text) on Islamic creed, and listing the prophets is a key part of the section on \"Belief in the Messengers.\"\n\n2.  **Locate the Relevant Section:** To answer this, we must identify the section in the poem dealing with the prophets. After discussing the attributes of Allah, the author moves on to the attributes of the prophets (like truthfulness, trustworthiness, etc.). Immediately following this, he introduces the list of the 25 prophets.\n\n3.  **Identify the Starting Verse:** The section concerning the names of the prophets begins with an introductory verse that states the obligation of knowing the twenty-five. In most standard editions of the poem, this is **bayt 31**:\n    > تَفْصِيْلُ خَمْسَةٍ وَعِشْرِيْنَ لَزِمْ\n    > كُلَّ مُكَلَّفٍ فَحَقِّقْ وَاغْتَنِمْ\n    > **Translation:** \"The details of twenty-five [prophets] are necessary for every accountable person, so verify and seize [this knowledge].\"\n    This verse *introduces* the list but does not contain any names itself. The actual enumeration begins in the next verse.\n\n4.  **Trace the Verses Containing the Names:** The names are listed over the next four verses.\n    *   **Bayt 32** starts the list with the first group of prophets:\n        > هُمْ آدَمٌ إِدْرِيْسُ نُوْحٌ هُوْدٌ مَعْ\n        > صَالِحْ وَإِبْرَاهِيْمُ كُلٌّ مُتَّبَعْ\n        > **Prophets mentioned:** Adam, Idris, Nuh, Hud, Salih, Ibrahim.\n    *   **Bayt 33** continues the list:\n        > لُوْطٌ وَإِسْمَاعِيْلُ إِسْحَاقُ كَذَا\n        > يَعْقُوْبُ يُوْسُفُ وَأَيُّوْبُ احْتَذَى\n        > **Prophets mentioned:** Lut, Isma'il, Ishaq, Ya'qub, Yusuf, Ayyub.\n    *   **Bayt 34** lists the next group:\n        > شُعَيْبُ هَارُوْنُ وَمُوْسَى وَالْيَسَعْ\n        > ذُو الْكِفْلِ دَاوُدُ سُلَيْمَانُ اتَّبَعْ\n        > **Prophets mentioned:** Shu'ayb, Harun, Musa, Al-Yasa', Dhul-Kifl, Dawud, Sulayman.\n    *   **Bayt 35** concludes the list of 25 prophets:\n        > إِلْيَاسُ يُوْنُسُ زَكَرِيَّا يَحْيَى\n        > عِيْسَى وَطَهَ خَاتِمٌ دَعْ غَيَّا\n        > **Prophets mentioned:** Ilyas, Yunus, Zakariyya, Yahya, 'Isa, and Taha (a name for Prophet Muhammad), the Seal [of the Prophets].\n\n5.  **Identify the Concluding Verse:** Bayt 35 is the final verse that lists names. The next verse, **bayt 36**, is a concluding prayer for the prophets just mentioned and marks the end of the list.\n    > عَلَيْهِمُ الصَّلاَةُ وَالسَّلاَمُ\n    > وَآلِهِمْ مَا دَامَتِ الْأَيَّامُ\n    > **Translation:** \"Upon them be prayers and peace, and upon their families, as long as the days last.\"\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nBased on the analysis, the question asks \"from which bayt to which... are the names... mentioned\".\n*   The first name (Adam) appears in **Bayt 32**.\n*   The last name (Muhammad, referred to as Taha) appears in **Bayt 35**.\n\nTherefore, the names of the prophets are mentioned from Bayt 32 to Bayt 35.\n\n### Careful Points to Note:\n\n*   **Verse Numbering:** Verse numbering can sometimes vary slightly between different printed editions (e.g., by one verse), but the content and sequence of the verses remain the same. The range identified here (from the verse starting with \"Hum Adam...\" to the one ending with \"...'Isa wa Taha\") is standard.\n*   **Introductory Verse:** It is important to distinguish between the verse *introducing* the topic (Bayt 31) and the verses *listing the names* (Bayt 32-35). The question specifically asks for the verses where the names are mentioned.\n\n<<<From Bayt 32 to Bayt 35.>>>"
