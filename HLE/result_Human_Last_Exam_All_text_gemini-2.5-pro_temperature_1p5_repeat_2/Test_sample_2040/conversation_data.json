    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core phenomenon: Spontaneous Parametric Downconversion (SPDC).**\nSPDC is a nonlinear optical process where a single high-energy photon (called the \"pump\" photon) interacts with a nonlinear material and spontaneously splits into two lower-energy photons (called the \"signal\" and \"idler\" photons). This process must conserve both energy and momentum. The most fundamental requirement for a material to facilitate SPDC is that it must possess a significant second-order nonlinear optical susceptibility, denoted as χ⁽²⁾.\n\n**Step 2: Relate material properties to the key requirement (non-zero χ⁽²⁾).**\nA material's second-order nonlinear susceptibility (χ⁽²⁾) is directly linked to its crystal structure symmetry. In the dominant electric dipole approximation, χ⁽²⁾ is a third-rank tensor. For a material that possesses a center of inversion symmetry (i.e., it is **centrosymmetric**), all components of the χ⁽²⁾ tensor are zero. Consequently, second-order nonlinear effects like SPDC and second-harmonic generation (SHG) are forbidden in such materials. For a material to exhibit SPDC, it must be **non-centrosymmetric**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the material in question: Free-standing Boron Nanosheets (Borophene).**\nWe need to determine the crystal structure and symmetry of boron nanosheets. Borophene is a two-dimensional (2D) allotrope of boron. Several different atomic arrangements, or polymorphs, have been predicted and synthesized, most commonly on silver substrates. The question specifies \"free-standing\" nanosheets, which means we should consider the intrinsic structure of the material, independent of any substrate-induced effects. The most commonly studied and stable polymorphs of borophene (e.g., β₁₂ and χ₃ phases) have a planar structure with an in-plane center of inversion.\n\n**Step 4: Combine the material properties with the physical requirement.**\nSince the common and stable structures of free-standing boron nanosheets are centrosymmetric, their bulk second-order nonlinear susceptibility (χ⁽²⁾) is zero. Because a non-zero χ⁽²⁾ is the essential requirement for SPDC to occur, boron nanosheets are not expected to exhibit this phenomenon.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion.**\nBased on the crystal symmetry of known borophene polymorphs, free-standing boron nanosheets should not exhibit spontaneous parametric downconversion. Their centrosymmetric nature forbids second-order nonlinear optical processes.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Symmetry is Key:** The central point of the analysis hinges on whether the material is centrosymmetric or non-centrosymmetric. This property dictates the possibility of all even-order nonlinear optical effects.\n2.  **\"Free-standing\" vs. \"On a Substrate\":** The question's detail about the nanosheets being \"free-standing\" is crucial. If borophene were on a substrate, the interaction with the substrate could break the inversion symmetry, potentially inducing a weak χ⁽²⁾ response. By specifying \"free-standing,\" this possibility is eliminated from consideration.\n3.  **Ideal vs. Real Structures:** The conclusion is based on the ideal crystal structure. In a real-world sample, factors like defects, edges, strain, or ripples/curvature could locally break the inversion symmetry. However, these effects would be weak, disordered, and highly inefficient for producing a coherent SPDC signal compared to a material that is intrinsically non-centrosymmetric.\n4.  **Higher-Order Effects:** While the dominant χ⁽²⁾ effect is forbidden, it is technically possible to have much weaker nonlinear interactions arising from electric quadrupole or magnetic dipole moments, or from higher-order susceptibilities like χ⁽³⁾. However, these are orders of magnitude weaker and are not what is generally understood as the SPDC process.\n5.  **Comparison to other 2D materials:** It is helpful to compare borophene to other well-known 2D materials. Graphene is also centrosymmetric and does not exhibit bulk SPDC. In contrast, monolayer hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) is non-centrosymmetric and has been shown to exhibit second-order nonlinear effects.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nNo, free-standing boron nanosheets would not be expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric downconversion. The reason is that the common, stable polymorphs of borophene have a centrosymmetric crystal structure. Materials with inversion symmetry have a zero second-order nonlinear susceptibility (χ⁽²⁾), which is a fundamental requirement for the SPDC process to occur.\n\n<<<No. Free-standing boron nanosheets are not expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric downconversion because their common crystal structures are centrosymmetric, which forbids second-order nonlinear optical processes like SPDC.>>>"
