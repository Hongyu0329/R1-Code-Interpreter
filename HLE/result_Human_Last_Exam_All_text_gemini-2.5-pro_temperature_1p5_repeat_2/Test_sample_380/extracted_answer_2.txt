The local magnetic field at the L1 point is generally not radial; it follows the Parker spiral, typically making an angle of about 45 degrees with the radial direction. The use of magnetic field components perpendicular to the radial direction to calculate normalized magnetic helicity is therefore an approximation, not a reflection of the true magnetic field orientation.

This approximation is justified for two main reasons:
1.  **The Taylor Hypothesis Framework:** In solar wind physics, it is common to use Taylor's "frozen-in flow" hypothesis, which assumes that waves and turbulence propagate radially outward along with the solar wind flow. Under this assumption, the wave's magnetic field must lie in the plane perpendicular to the radial direction, making the calculation valid within this specific analytical framework. This is most accurate for "quasi-parallel" conditions where the magnetic field happens to be nearly aligned with the radial direction.
2.  **Practicality in Statistical Analysis:** For large-scale studies, using a fixed, non-rotating coordinate system based on the radial direction is far more practical than continuously re-calculating a field-aligned system. While this method calculates a projection of the true helicity and may underestimate its magnitude, it reliably preserves the sign of the helicity. Since the sign determines whether the wave is left- or right-hand polarized (the primary goal of the calculation), this practical approach is considered acceptable for statistical surveys.
