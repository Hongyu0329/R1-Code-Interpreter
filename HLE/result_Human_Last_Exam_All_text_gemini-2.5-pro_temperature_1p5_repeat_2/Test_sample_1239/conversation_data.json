    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the dimension of the Lie group of symmetries of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$.\n\n### Step 1: Write down the equations\n\nThe incompressible Navier-Stokes equations describe the motion of a viscous, incompressible fluid. In $\\mathbb{R}^3$, with velocity field $\\mathbf{u}(t, \\mathbf{x}) = (u, v, w)$ and pressure field $p(t, \\mathbf{x})$, where $\\mathbf{x}=(x,y,z)$, the equations are:\n\n1.  **Momentum Equation:**\n    $$ \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}}{\\partial t} + (\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla) \\mathbf{u} = -\\nabla p + \\nu \\Delta \\mathbf{u} $$\n2.  **Incompressibility Condition:**\n    $$ \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u} = 0 $$\n\nHere, $\\nu$ is the constant kinematic viscosity, $\\nabla$ is the spatial gradient operator, and $\\Delta = \\nabla^2$ is the spatial Laplacian.\n\n### Step 2: Define Lie Group Symmetry\n\nA Lie group of symmetries of a system of differential equations is a group of transformations of the independent and dependent variables that maps any solution of the system to another solution. The dimension of this group is equal to the dimension of its Lie algebra, which is the vector space of the infinitesimal generators of these transformations. We find these generators systematically.\n\n### Step 3: Identify the Symmetry Generators\n\nA full derivation involves solving a large system of linear partial differential equations known as the \"determining equations\". However, we can identify the symmetries by analyzing the structure of the Navier-Stokes equations.\n\n1.  **Time Translation:** The equations do not explicitly depend on time $t$. This gives rise to time translation symmetry, $t \\to t + s$.\n    *   Generator: $\\partial_t$\n    *   Dimension: **1**\n\n2.  **Space Translations:** The equations have constant coefficients and are set in $\\mathbb{R}^3$, so they are invariant under spatial translations, $\\mathbf{x} \\to \\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{a}$.\n    *   Generators: $\\partial_x, \\partial_y, \\partial_z$\n    *   Dimension: **3**\n\n3.  **Space Rotations:** The equations are covariant under rotations of the coordinate system, as all terms are proper scalars or vectors. This corresponds to the symmetry group SO(3).\n    *   Generators: $x\\partial_y - y\\partial_x + u\\partial_v - v\\partial_u$, and its cyclic permutations for rotations about the y and z axes.\n    *   Dimension: **3**\n\n4.  **Galilean Boosts:** The equations are invariant under a change to a uniformly moving reference frame (Galilean invariance). The transformation is $\\mathbf{x} \\to \\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{c}t$, $\\mathbf{u} \\to \\mathbf{u} + \\mathbf{c}$ for a constant vector $\\mathbf{c}$.\n    *   Generators: $t\\partial_x + \\partial_u$, $t\\partial_y + \\partial_v$, $t\\partial_z + \\partial_w$.\n    *   Dimension: **3**\n\n5.  **Scaling (Dilation):** The equations possess a scaling symmetry. If we scale the variables as $t \\to a^2 t$, $\\mathbf{x} \\to a \\mathbf{x}$, $\\mathbf{u} \\to a^{-1}\\mathbf{u}$, and $p \\to a^{-2}p$, the equations remain invariant. The presence of the viscous term $\\nu \\Delta \\mathbf{u}$ fixes the relative scaling between space and time ($t \\propto |\\mathbf{x}|^2$). This is a single one-parameter group of transformations.\n    *   Generator: $2t\\partial_t + x\\partial_x + y\\partial_y + z\\partial_z - u\\partial_u - v\\partial_v - w\\partial_w - 2p\\partial_p$.\n    *   Dimension: **1**\n\nSumming the dimensions of these generators gives a finite-dimensional Lie algebra: $1 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 11$. This 11-dimensional algebra is known as the **Galilean-similitude algebra**.\n\n### Step 4: Careful Point - The Pressure \"Gauge\" Symmetry\n\nThere is a subtle and important additional symmetry. The pressure $p$ appears in the equations only through its gradient, $\\nabla p$. This means that if $(\\mathbf{u}(t, \\mathbf{x}), p(t, \\mathbf{x}))$ is a solution, then so is $(\\mathbf{u}(t, \\mathbf{x}), p(t, \\mathbf{x}) + f(t))$ for any arbitrary function $f(t)$, because $\\nabla(p+f(t)) = \\nabla p$.\n\n*   The infinitesimal generators corresponding to this symmetry are of the form $g(t)\\partial_p$, where $g(t)$ is any arbitrary smooth function of time.\n*   The vector space of such functions $g(t)$ is infinite-dimensional. For example, the functions $\\{1, t, t^2, \\dots \\}$ are all linearly independent and each corresponds to a symmetry generator.\n*   Therefore, the full Lie algebra of symmetries is **infinite-dimensional**.\n\n### Step 5: Interpretation and Final Answer\n\nThe existence of this infinite-dimensional symmetry algebra is a crucial feature of the Navier-Stokes equations. However, this symmetry is often considered a \"gauge symmetry\" or a \"trivial symmetry\" for the following reasons:\n*   It acts only on the pressure variable $p$, which is often viewed as a Lagrange multiplier that enforces the incompressibility constraint $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u}=0$, rather than a primary physical variable.\n*   In formulations of the problem where the pressure is eliminated (for example, by using a streamfunction or by applying the Leray projection operator), this infinite-dimensional symmetry disappears. The remaining symmetries are precisely the 11-dimensional group identified above.\n\nTherefore, when asked for \"the dimension\" of the symmetry group in this context, it is standard practice to refer to the dimension of the maximal finite-dimensional Lie group of \"physical\" symmetries that act on spacetime and the velocity field. This is the 11-dimensional group generated by translations, rotations, boosts, and scaling.\n\nThe total number of generators for the finite-dimensional part of the symmetry group is $1+3+3+3+1=11$."
