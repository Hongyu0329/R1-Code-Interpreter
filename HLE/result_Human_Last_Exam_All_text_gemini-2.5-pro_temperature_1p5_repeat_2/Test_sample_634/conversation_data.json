    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n**1. Understand the Problem**\n\nWe need to find the Greatest Common Right Divisor (GCRD) of two polynomial matrices, P1(s) and P2(s).\n\n*   **P1(s) = [[s^2 + s, -s], [-s^2 - 1, s^2]]**\n*   **P2(s) = [[s, 0], [-s - 1, 1]]**\n\n**2. Key Concepts**\n\n*   **Right Divisor:** A matrix R(s) is a right divisor of P(s) if P(s) = Q(s)R(s) for some polynomial matrix Q(s).\n*   **Common Right Divisor:** A matrix R(s) is a common right divisor of P1(s) and P2(s) if it is a right divisor of both.\n*   **Greatest Common Right Divisor (GCRD):** A common right divisor R(s) is a GCRD if any other common right divisor D(s) is a right divisor of R(s). The GCRD is unique up to left multiplication by a unimodular matrix (a polynomial matrix with a constant non-zero determinant).\n\n**3. Method: Euclidean Algorithm for Polynomial Matrices**\n\nThe GCRD can be found by performing elementary row operations on a stacked matrix formed by P1 and P2.\n\n1.  Create a compound matrix `M = [P1; P2]`.\n    M = [[s^2 + s, -s],\n         [-s^2 - 1, s^2],\n         [s, 0],\n         [-s - 1, 1]]\n2.  Use elementary row operations to reduce M to the form `[R; 0]`, where R is a 2x2 matrix and 0 is the 2x2 zero matrix. The resulting matrix R(s) will be a GCRD of P1 and P2.\n    *   **Allowed Operations:**\n        1.  Swap two rows.\n        2.  Multiply a row by a non-zero constant.\n        3.  Add a polynomial multiple of one row to another row.\n\n**4. Execution of the Algorithm**\n\nLet the rows of M be R1, R2, R3, R4.\nM = [R1; R2; R3; R4]\n\n*   **Goal:** Use the simpler rows (R3 and R4) to simplify the more complex rows (R1 and R2). Specifically, we want to create zeros in the first column of R1 and R2.\n\n*   **Step 1: R1 <- R1 - (s+1) * R3**\n    The first element of R1 is `s^2 + s`. The first element of R3 is `s`. The quotient is `(s^2+s)/s = s+1`.\n    New R1 = `[s^2 + s, -s] - (s+1)[s, 0]`\n           = `[s^2 + s - (s^2 + s), -s - 0]`\n           = `[0, -s]`\n\n*   **Step 2: R2 <- R2 + s * R3**\n    We use R3 to simplify R2. To eliminate the `-s^2` term in R2, we can add `s*R3`.\n    New R2 = `[-s^2 - 1, s^2] + s[s, 0]`\n           = `[-s^2 - 1 + s^2, s^2 + 0]`\n           = `[-1, s^2]`\n\nNow the matrix M is transformed into:\nM' = [[0, -s],\n      [-1, s^2],\n      [s, 0],\n      [-s - 1, 1]]\n\n*   **Step 3: Reorder and Normalize**\n    To make reduction easier, let's move the rows with leading constants to the top and make the leading coefficient 1.\n    Swap R1 and R2:\n    [[-1, s^2],\n     [0, -s],\n     [s, 0],\n     [-s - 1, 1]]\n    Multiply the new R1 by -1:\n    M'' = [[1, -s^2],\n           [0, -s],\n           [s, 0],\n           [-s - 1, 1]]\n\n*   **Step 4: Eliminate other elements in the first column**\n    Use the new R1 `[1, -s^2]` to eliminate the first elements of R3 and R4.\n    **R3 <- R3 - s * R1**\n    New R3 = `[s, 0] - s[1, -s^2]`\n           = `[s - s, 0 - s(-s^2)]`\n           = `[0, s^3]`\n    **R4 <- R4 + (s+1) * R1**\n    New R4 = `[-s - 1, 1] + (s+1)[1, -s^2]`\n           = `[-s - 1 + s + 1, 1 + (s+1)(-s^2)]`\n           = `[0, 1 - s^3 - s^2]`\n\nThe matrix is now:\nM''' = [[1, -s^2],\n        [0, -s],\n        [0, s^3],\n        [0, 1 - s^3 - s^2]]\n\n*   **Step 5: Reduce the remaining rows**\n    We now focus on the rows with a leading zero: R2, R3, and R4. This is equivalent to finding the GCRD of the 1x2 matrices `[0, -s]`, `[0, s^3]`, and `[0, 1 - s^3 - s^2]`. This reduces to finding the GCD of the polynomials `-s`, `s^3`, and `1 - s^3 - s^2`.\n    1.  `gcd(-s, s^3) = s`.\n    2.  Now find `gcd(s, 1 - s^3 - s^2)` using polynomial division:\n        `(1 - s^3 - s^2) รท s` gives `(-s^3 - s^2 + 1) = s(-s^2 - s) + 1`.\n        The remainder is 1. Therefore, `gcd(s, 1 - s^3 - s^2) = 1`.\n    This implies we can use row operations to obtain a row `[0, 1]`. Let `P(s) = 1 - s^3 - s^2` and `D(s) = -s`. The quotient is `q(s) = s^2+s`. The corresponding row operation is `Row_P <- Row_P - q(s) * Row_D`.\n    **R4 <- R4 - (s^2 + s) * R2**\n    New R4 = `[0, 1 - s^3 - s^2] - (s^2 + s)[0, -s]`\n           = `[0, 1 - s^3 - s^2 - (-s^3 - s^2)]`\n           = `[0, 1 - s^3 - s^2 + s^3 + s^2]`\n           = `[0, 1]`\n\nThe matrix becomes:\nM'''' = [[1, -s^2],\n         [0, -s],\n         [0, s^3],\n         [0, 1]]\n\n*   **Step 6: Final Reduction (Back Substitution)**\n    Use the row `[0, 1]` to eliminate all other non-zero elements in the second column.\n    Swap R2 and R4 to bring `[0, 1]` up:\n    [[1, -s^2],\n     [0, 1],\n     [0, s^3],\n     [0, -s]]\n    **R1 <- R1 + s^2 * R2**\n    New R1 = `[1, -s^2] + s^2[0, 1] = [1, 0]`\n    **R3 <- R3 - s^3 * R2**\n    New R3 = `[0, s^3] - s^3[0, 1] = [0, 0]`\n    **R4 <- R4 + s * R2**\n    New R4 = `[0, -s] + s[0, 1] = [0, 0]`\n\nThe final matrix is:\n[[1, 0],\n [0, 1],\n [0, 0],\n [0, 0]]\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n\nThe reduction of the stacked matrix `[P1; P2]` resulted in `[I; 0]`, where `I` is the 2x2 identity matrix.\nTherefore, the greatest common right divisor of P1 and P2 is the identity matrix.\n\nR(s) = [[1, 0],\n        [0, 1]]\n\nThis means that P1(s) and P2(s) are right coprime.\n\n<<\n[[1, 0],\n [0, 1]]\n>>>"
