    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of historical saints mentioned by name in Milton's *Paradise Lost*.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the User's Question:** The request is to count the number of \"historical saints\" mentioned by name in *Paradise Lost*.\n    *   **\"Historical Saint\"**: This is a crucial distinction. It refers to a person who lived after the biblical era of the Apostles and was later canonized as a saint by the Christian Church (primarily the Catholic Church). This excludes biblical figures like Moses, David, Mary, Peter, or Paul, who are considered saints in a broader sense but are fundamentally biblical characters. The question is looking for post-biblical, historical individuals.\n    *   **\"Mentioned by name\"**: The saint's actual name (or a clear derivative) must appear in the text, not just an allusion to their followers or a general reference to sainthood.\n    *   **\"Paradise Lost\"**: The source text is John Milton's epic poem.\n\n2.  **Consider Milton's Theological Perspective:** Milton was a devout Puritan and was strongly anti-Catholic. He viewed the institutional Catholic Church, its rituals, and its veneration of saints as corruptions of true Christianity. Therefore, it is highly improbable that he would mention saints in a positive or laudatory way. Any mention is likely to be critical or satirical. This context helps narrow down where to look.\n\n3.  **Identify Potential Locations in the Text:** Where would Milton discuss post-biblical Church history?\n    *   **Book III:** In a famous passage, Milton describes a \"Limbo of Vanity\" or \"Paradise of Fools.\" This is where useless and vain things from Earth end up. It is a prime location for a satirical critique of what Milton considered false religious practices.\n    *   **Book XII:** The Archangel Michael shows Adam the future of humanity after Christ's ascension. He foretells the corruption of the Church by \"grievous wolves.\" This section could potentially name figures associated with this corruption.\n\n4.  **Analyze Book III:**\n    *   In Book III, lines 473-497, Milton describes the \"Paradise of Fools.\" He lists various \"trumpery\" of the Catholic Church, such as relics, indulgences, and pardons.\n    *   Within this passage, he specifically mentions people who hope to get into Heaven through superficial means associated with monastic orders.\n    *   The key lines are (Book III, lines 478-480):\n        > \"And they who to be sure of Paradise\n        > Dying put on the weeds of **Dominic**,\n        > Or in **Franciscan** think to pass disguised...\"\n    *   Here we find two clear names:\n        *   **Dominic**: Refers to **Saint Dominic de Guzmán** (c. 1170–1221), founder of the Dominican Order (also known as the Black Friars).\n        *   **Franciscan**: Refers to the order founded by **Saint Francis of Assisi** (c. 1181–1226). Mentioning the order is a direct and unambiguous reference to its namesake founder.\n\n5.  **Analyze Book XII:**\n    *   In Book XII, Michael's prophecy about the future of the Church is general in its criticism. He speaks of men who will \"tread the sacred rites of Christ's institution underfoot\" and \"force the Spirit of Grace itself, and bind His consort Liberty.\"\n    *   He describes the rise of persecution and the tainting of truth with \"superstitions and traditions.\" However, he **does not name any specific post-biblical historical figures** in this prophecy. His condemnation is aimed at the systems and types of corruption, not individuals by name.\n\n6.  **Consolidate the Findings and Final Count:**\n    *   A thorough review of the text confirms that the only passage mentioning historical, post-biblical saints by name is the \"Paradise of Fools\" section in Book III.\n    *   The individuals identified are Saint Dominic and Saint Francis of Assisi.\n    *   No other figures fitting the criteria of \"historical saint\" (e.g., Augustine, Jerome, Thomas Aquinas, etc.) are named in the poem.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThere are exactly two historical saints mentioned by name in *Paradise Lost*: Saint Dominic and Saint Francis of Assisi. They are both mentioned critically in Book III as founders of monastic orders whose followers wrongly believe that wearing their habit is a ticket to Heaven.\n\n<<<2>>>"
