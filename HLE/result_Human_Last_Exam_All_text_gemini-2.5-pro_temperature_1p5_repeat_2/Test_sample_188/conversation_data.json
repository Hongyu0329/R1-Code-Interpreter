  "question": "In a recent excavation of an ancient Chinese tomb, people found two books called Ching and Shu. The Ching contains exactly 9999 symbols of yinyang-wuxing, such as yin-water or yang-fire. The Shu contains around 3000 ancient Chinese characters. Using advanced language modeling and computer vision technologies, people discover that the Shu is written with only 120 most common Chinese characters at that time. The computer vision tool can recognize such a character in 12 ms. Computation time for each operation on integers and floats is 10 ns and 30 ns, respectively.\n\nPeople believe that the Ching has a secret message encrypted with its symbols. This message is also written using the letters in the Shu. What is the max length of this message?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>.",

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the maximum length of the secret message.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Information Source (The Ching)\nThe problem states that the book Ching contains the encrypted message.\n*   **Total number of symbols:** The Ching has exactly 9999 symbols.\n*   **Nature of each symbol:** Each symbol is a \"yinyang-wuxing\" combination.\n    *   \"Yinyang\" has 2 possible states: yin or yang.\n    *   \"Wuxing\" (The Five Elements/Phases) has 5 possible states: wood, fire, earth, metal, water.\n*   **Number of distinct states per symbol:** To find the total number of unique symbols possible, we multiply the number of states for each component.\n    *   Number of states = (Number of yinyang states) × (Number of wuxing states) = 2 × 5 = 10.\n*   **Conclusion:** Each of the 9999 symbols in the Ching can be one of 10 distinct types. This is the basis of our encoding system.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Message Alphabet (The Shu)\nThe problem states that the secret message is written using the letters (characters) found in the Shu.\n*   **Alphabet size:** The Shu is written with \"only 120 most common Chinese characters\". This means the alphabet for the secret message consists of 120 unique characters.\n*   **Goal:** We need to use the 10-state symbols from the Ching to represent these 120 different characters.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Encoding Scheme\nWe need to figure out how many symbols from the Ching are required to represent one character from the Shu's alphabet. This is a problem of information capacity.\n*   We have a base-10 system (from the 10 states of the Ching symbols).\n*   We need to represent 120 different items (the characters).\n*   Let `k` be the number of Ching symbols used to form a \"codeword\" for a single message character. The number of unique codewords possible with `k` symbols is `10^k`.\n*   We need to find the smallest integer `k` such that the number of possible codewords is greater than or equal to the size of the alphabet (`10^k >= 120`).\n    *   If `k = 1`, we can represent `10^1 = 10` characters. This is not enough.\n    *   If `k = 2`, we can represent `10^2 = 100` characters. This is still not enough to represent all 120 characters.\n    *   If `k = 3`, we can represent `10^3 = 1000` characters. This is more than enough to assign a unique 3-symbol code to each of the 120 characters.\n*   **Conclusion:** A sequence of **3 symbols** from the Ching is required to encode one character of the secret message.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Maximum Message Length\nNow we can calculate the maximum length of the message by determining how many 3-symbol blocks can be formed from the total number of symbols available in the Ching.\n*   Total symbols available in the Ching = 9999.\n*   Symbols required per message character = 3.\n*   Maximum message length = (Total available symbols) / (Symbols required per character).\n*   Maximum length = 9999 / 3 = 3333.\n*   Since 9999 is perfectly divisible by 3, there are no leftover symbols. The message can be exactly 3333 characters long.\n\n### Step 5: Identify and Discard Irrelevant Information\nThe problem includes several pieces of information that are not needed for the calculation. Recognizing these is a key part of the analysis.\n*   **\"The Shu contains around 3000 ancient Chinese characters.\"**: The total length of the Shu is irrelevant. The crucial piece of information is the size of its unique character set (120).\n*   **\"The computer vision tool can recognize such a character in 12 ms.\"**: This is a detail about the speed of technology for reading the Shu, which has no bearing on the information capacity of the Ching.\n*   **\"Computation time for each operation on integers and floats is 10 ns and 30 ns, respectively.\"**: This is computational performance data, completely unrelated to the encryption and information theory problem at hand.\n\nThese details are red herrings designed to make the problem seem more complex than it is.\n\n### Final Answer Calculation\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the maximum length of the message is calculated by dividing the total number of encoding symbols by the number of symbols needed to represent a single character of the alphabet.\n\nMaximum Message Length = 9999 / 3 = 3333\n\n<<<3333>>>"
