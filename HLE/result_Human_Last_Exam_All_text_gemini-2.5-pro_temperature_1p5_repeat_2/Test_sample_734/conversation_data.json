    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe core components of the question are:\n1.  **Who:** The subject must be a single \"Christian theologian\".\n2.  **What:** This theologian must have been the \"first\" to develop \"specialized terminology\". This is crucial; we are looking for the originator of a specific set of terms, not just someone who discussed the general idea.\n3.  **Why:** The terminology must be used to \"describe changes in the laws of nature\".\n4.  **Application:** The terminology must be applicable to two distinct scenarios:\n    *   The \"virgin birth of Jesus\" (a singular, miraculous event).\n    *   \"Possible alterations in natural laws at the Fall\" (a systemic, ongoing change to the state of creation).\n\n**Step 2: Identify Potential Candidates and Key Concepts**\n*   **Early Church Fathers:** These are the most likely candidates for being the \"first\". Figures like Irenaeus, Origen, and Augustine are prominent.\n*   **Scholastic Theologians:** Figures like Anselm and Thomas Aquinas developed highly systematic and terminological theology, but they came after the Church Fathers.\n*   **Key Theological Concepts:** We need to look for concepts related to miracles, creation, providence, the Fall (hamartiology), and God's relationship to natural order.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Candidates and Their Terminology**\n\n*   **Pre-Augustinian Fathers (e.g., Irenaeus):** While they wrote about the Fall and the virgin birth, they were generally less focused on creating a systematic philosophical framework with specialized terminology to explain the precise *mechanics* of God's interaction with natural law. Their focus was more on narrative, typological, and pastoral theology.\n\n*   **Thomas Aquinas (13th Century):** Aquinas is famous for his detailed terminology. His distinction between God's **\"potentia absoluta\"** (absolute power) and **\"potentia ordinata\"** (ordained power) is highly relevant. The ordained power refers to God working through the consistent laws of nature He established, while the absolute power refers to His ability to do anything, including miracles that supersede the ordained laws. This framework clearly applies to the virgin birth (an act of absolute power) and the Fall (a change in the ordained order). However, Aquinas came much later than other key figures. He was building upon earlier foundations. Thus, he cannot be the \"first\".\n\n*   **Augustine of Hippo (4th-5th Century):** Augustine is the most promising candidate. He engaged deeply with the philosophical questions of his day and was arguably the first to create a truly comprehensive theological system in the Latin West.\n    *   **Specialized Terminology:** Augustine developed the concept of the **\"rationes seminales\"** (often translated as \"seminal reasons\" or \"causal reasons\"). He adapted this idea from Stoic philosophy.\n    *   **Function of the Terminology:** Augustine proposed that God, in the initial act of creation, embedded these \"seminal reasons\" within nature. These are hidden potentialities for things that would emerge later in time. The regular, predictable functioning of nature is the unfolding of some of these reasons.\n    *   **Application to the Virgin Birth:** For Augustine, a miracle like the virgin birth is not a violation of nature itself, but a violation of *our knowledge* of nature. It's the activation by God of a \"seminal reason\" that He had placed in creation from the beginning, one that lies outside the normal, observable course of events. Thus, it's a change in the *known* laws of nature, explained by specific theological terminology.\n    *   **Application to the Fall:** Augustine's doctrine of the Fall posits a radical change in the condition of both humanity and creation. Before the Fall, human nature operated according to one set of principles (e.g., potential immortality, uncorrupted will). After the Fall, as a result of God's judgment, it operates according to a different, fallen set of principles (mortality, concupiscence, etc.). The world itself is altered. This constitutes a fundamental \"alteration in natural laws\" (or at least the laws governing human nature and its environment). Augustine's overarching framework of God's sovereign ordering of history, which includes his concept of \"seminal reasons\" for new things, is the first systematic attempt to theologically account for both singular miracles and systemic shifts in the natural order.\n\n**Step 4: Conclusion**\nWhile Aquinas provided a very clear set of terms, he was not the first. Augustine of Hippo, writing centuries earlier, was the first major Christian theologian to develop a sophisticated and specific terminology (\"rationes seminales\") to explain how God could bring about events like the virgin birth that appear to be changes in the laws of nature, within a broader theological system that also accounted for the fundamental alteration of nature's laws at the Fall.\n\n<<<Augustine of Hippo>>>"
