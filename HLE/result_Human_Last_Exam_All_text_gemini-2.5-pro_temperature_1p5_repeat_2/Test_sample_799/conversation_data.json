    "Answering this question requires understanding the definitions of a Sidon set and Hausdorff dimension, and then combining results from geometric measure theory.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Definitions\n\n*   **Sidon Set:** A set $E \\subset \\mathbb{R}$ is called a Sidon set (or a $B_2$ set) if the equation $x_1 + x_2 = x_3 + x_4$ with $x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4 \\in E$ has only \"trivial\" solutions. A trivial solution is one where the pair of numbers on the left is a permutation of the pair on the right, i.e., $\\{x_1, x_2\\} = \\{x_3, x_4\\}$. This means either $(x_1, x_2) = (x_3, x_4)$ or $(x_1, x_2) = (x_4, x_3)$. This property imposes a strong arithmetic constraint on the set.\n\n*   **Hausdorff Dimension:** The Hausdorff dimension, denoted $\\dim_H(E)$, is a way of measuring the \"fractal\" dimension of a set $E$. It can be any non-negative real number. For familiar sets, it matches our intuition: a point has dimension 0, a line segment has dimension 1, and a filled square has dimension 2. For fractal sets like the middle-third Cantor set, the dimension can be a fraction (in that case, $\\log(2)/\\log(3) \\approx 0.63$).\n\nWe are looking for the maximum possible Hausdorff dimension for a set $E \\subset [0, 1]$ that is also a Sidon set.\n\n### Step 2: Finding an Upper Bound for the Dimension\n\nLet $E \\subset [0, 1]$ be a Sidon set, and let its Hausdorff dimension be $s = \\dim_H(E)$. We want to show that $s$ cannot be larger than $1/2$.\n\nThe argument relies on a key principle from geometric measure theory: how dimension behaves under projections.\n\n1.  **Product Sets:** If we take the Cartesian product of $E$ with itself, we get a set $E \\times E$ in the plane $\\mathbb{R}^2$. A fundamental result states that the dimension of the product set is at least the sum of the dimensions, so $\\dim_H(E \\times E) \\ge \\dim_H(E) + \\dim_H(E) = 2s$. In most \"nice\" cases, including this one, equality holds: $\\dim_H(E \\times E) = 2s$.\n\n2.  **The Sum Set as a Projection:** Consider the set of all sums of pairs of elements from $E$, denoted by $E+E = \\{x+y \\mid x, y \\in E\\}$. This sum set can be viewed as a projection of the product set $E \\times E$. Specifically, let's consider the mapping (projection) $g: \\mathbb{R}^2 \\to \\mathbb{R}$ defined by $g(x,y) = x+y$. Then $E+E = g(E \\times E)$.\n\n3.  **Connecting the Pieces:** Now we combine these ideas. Assume, for the sake of contradiction, that $\\dim_H(E) = s > 1/2$.\n    *   From point 1, this would mean $\\dim_H(E \\times E) = 2s > 1$.\n    *   The mapping $g(x,y)=x+y$ is a Lipschitz map (in fact, it's linear), and such maps do not increase Hausdorff dimension. So, $\\dim_H(E+E) \\le \\dim_H(E \\times E)$.\n    *   Here, the Sidon property becomes crucial. It implies that for any $z \\in \\mathbb{R}$, the set of pairs in $E \\times E$ that sum to $z$ (i.e., the fiber $g^{-1}(z) \\cap (E \\times E)$) contains at most two points (the pair $(x,y)$ and its swapped version $(y,x)$). Because the map $g$ doesn't \"crush\" its domain too much (the fibers are finite and small), there is a strong relationship between the dimension of the domain and the image. A theorem in geometric measure theory states that for a set like $E \\times E$, under these conditions, the dimension is preserved: $\\dim_H(E+E) = \\dim_H(E \\times E)$.\n    *   So, if we assume $s > 1/2$, we get the following chain of implications:\n        $\\dim_H(E) = s > 1/2 \\implies \\dim_H(E \\times E) = 2s > 1 \\implies \\dim_H(E+E) = 2s > 1$.\n    *   This leads to a contradiction. The set $E+E$ is a subset of the real line (specifically, of $[0, 2]$ since $E \\subset [0,1]$). Any subset of the real line must have a Hausdorff dimension of at most 1. Our conclusion that $\\dim_H(E+E) > 1$ is therefore impossible.\n\n4.  **Conclusion of the Upper Bound:** The assumption that $s > 1/2$ must be false. Therefore, for any Sidon set $E$, we must have $\\dim_H(E) \\le 1/2$. This means the maximum possible dimension is at most $1/2$.\n\n### Step 3: Showing the Upper Bound is Attainable\n\nTo show that $1/2$ is the maximum, we need to demonstrate that there exists at least one Sidon set in $[0,1]$ that has a Hausdorff dimension of exactly $1/2$.\n\nThe construction of such a set is not trivial and is a classic result in harmonic analysis and fractal geometry, often attributed to Jean-Pierre Kahane and others. These constructions can be complex, often involving randomized methods (probabilistic constructions).\n\nFor instance, one can construct a random Cantor-type set and show that, with probability 1, the resulting set is a Sidon set with Hausdorff dimension $1/2$. While the details are advanced, the conclusion is well-established in the literature. It is known that for any value $s \\in [0, 1/2]$, one can construct a Sidon set with Hausdorff dimension $s$.\n\n### Step 4: Final Answer\n\nCombining the results from Step 2 and Step 3:\n*   The Hausdorff dimension of any Sidon set in $[0,1]$ is at most $1/2$.\n*   There exist Sidon sets in $[0,1]$ with a Hausdorff dimension of exactly $1/2$.\n\nTherefore, the maximum Hausdorff dimension of a Sidon set in the reals between 0 and 1 is $1/2$.\n\n<<<1/2>>>"
