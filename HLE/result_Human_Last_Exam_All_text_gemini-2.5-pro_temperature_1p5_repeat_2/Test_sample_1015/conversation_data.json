    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question and answer choices.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Movement:** *Cambré derrière*. This is a classical ballet term meaning to arch or bend the body backwards. The movement originates from the waist and involves the upper body and spine.\n    *   **Methods:** The question asks to compare two distinct classical ballet training methods: Vaganova and Balanchine.\n        *   **Vaganova Method (Russian):** Developed by Agrippina Vaganova, this method is renowned for its precision, logical progression, and emphasis on strength, clean lines, and coordinating the entire body. It prioritizes stability and control, with movements originating from a strong core.\n        *   **Balanchine Method (American):** Developed by choreographer George Balanchine, this method is known for its speed, musicality, and dynamic, often extreme lines. It often modifies classical positions to achieve a particular aesthetic, emphasizing energy and length.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Execution of *Cambré Derrière* in Each Method:**\n    *   **Vaganova Method:** The Vaganova *cambré derrière* is executed with a strong emphasis on maintaining correct alignment. The dancer must lift the chest and upper back *up and out* of the waist before beginning the bend. Crucially, the hips must remain square and directly over the supporting legs. Pushing the hips forward is considered a major technical fault, as it breaks the classical line and puts undue strain on the lower back. The bend should primarily occur in the thoracic (upper and middle) spine. The feeling is one of lengthening upwards and then arching back.\n    *   **Balanchine Method:** The Balanchine *cambré derrière* has a different aesthetic goal. To create a longer and more dramatic visual line, the dancer is often instructed to push the hips forward. This displacement of the pelvis allows for what appears to be a deeper and more sweeping arch. The line is less about vertical integrity and more about creating an expansive, dynamic shape. This \"broken hip\" line is a signature element of the Balanchine style.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Answer Choices based on the Analysis:**\n\n    *   **A. Arm placement during allongé:** While both methods have specific rules for arm pathways and positions (the *port de bras*), and the *allongé* (extended) quality is important, this is not the most fundamental or defining difference in the *cambré derrière* itself. The core mechanics of the torso and pelvis are more distinct.\n    *   **B. Placement of hip:** This aligns perfectly with our analysis. Vaganova insists on keeping the hips stable and pulled back, while Balanchine encourages pushing the hips forward. This is a clear, widely recognized technical distinction between the two styles for this particular movement.\n    *   **C. Speed:** A *cambré* is an *adagio* (slow) movement. While Balanchine is famous for his fast *allegro* choreography, the fundamental technique of a *cambré* is not defined by its speed.\n    *   **D. Degree of backbend:** While a Balanchine *cambré* might *look* deeper, this is often a *result* of the hip being pushed forward. The actual flexibility required might be similar, but the technique used to achieve the bend is different. The placement of the hip is the *cause* of the visual difference in depth, making it the more fundamental point of contrast.\n    *   **E. Placement of head:** Head placement is a component of the overall line in both methods. In Vaganova, the head follows the spine and lifts back. In Balanchine, it might also follow a specific line. However, the position of the head is dictated by the arch of the spine, which is in turn fundamentally affected by the placement of the hips. Therefore, hip placement is the more foundational difference.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe most significant and defining technical difference between how a *cambré derrière* is performed in the Vaganova and Balanchine methods is the placement of the hips. Vaganova requires the hips to be held stable over the legs, while Balanchine allows or encourages the hips to push forward to create a different aesthetic line.\n\n<<<B>>>"
