    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Terraria's Expert Mode with an infinite number of players.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Base Health:**\n    First, we need the base health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode for a single player. According to the game's data, while the Classic Mode health is 2800, the Expert Mode health for a single player is set to a specific value.\n    *   **Careful Point:** For many enemies and bosses, Expert Mode health is simply double the Classic Mode health. However, the Eye of Cthulhu is a special case. Its health is increased by a specific factor (`*1.3`), not doubled.\n    *   Base Health (Classic) = 2800\n    *   Base Health (Expert, 1 Player) = 2800 * 1.3 = **3640**\n\n2.  **Determine the Multiplayer Scaling Formula:**\n    In Expert Mode, boss health scales upwards with the number of players in the world. The formula is based on an additional percentage increase for each player beyond the first one.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The scaling applies to each player after the first. For one player, there is no additional scaling.\n    *   The health increase per additional player is **35%** of the base Expert Mode health.\n    *   Let `N` be the number of players.\n    *   The multiplayer health multiplier can be expressed as: `1 + (N - 1) * 0.35`\n    *   For N=1 player: `1 + (1 - 1) * 0.35 = 1 + 0 = 1.0x` (No change)\n    *   For N=2 players: `1 + (2 - 1) * 0.35 = 1 + 0.35 = 1.35x`\n    *   For N=3 players: `1 + (3 - 1) * 0.35 = 1 + 0.70 = 1.70x`\n\n3.  **Formulate the Complete Health Equation:**\n    By combining the base health and the multiplayer scaling formula, we get the equation for the total health of the Eye of Cthulhu for `N` players.\n    *   Total Health(N) = Base Expert Health * Multiplayer Multiplier\n    *   **Total Health(N) = 3640 * (1 + (N - 1) * 0.35)**\n\n4.  **Analyze the Formula with an Infinite Number of Players (Mathematical Limit):**\n    The question asks for the theoretical maximum health given an *infinite* number of players. This requires us to find the limit of the function `Total Health(N)` as `N` approaches infinity.\n    *   The formula `3640 * (1 + 0.35N - 0.35)` simplifies to `3640 * (0.65 + 0.35N)`.\n    *   This is a linear function of `N`. As `N` increases, the health increases without bound.\n    *   `lim (N -> ∞) [3640 * (0.65 + 0.35N)] = ∞`\n    *   Mathematically, the health would be infinite.\n\n5.  **Analyze the Constraints of the Source Code (Technical Limit):**\n    The question critically specifies \"According to the source code\". This means we must consider the technical limitations of the game's implementation. In Terraria (which is written in C#), NPC health is stored in a standard 32-bit signed integer variable (`int`).\n    *   **Careful Point:** A 32-bit signed integer has a maximum possible value. Any calculation that exceeds this value will result in an \"integer overflow,\" which is an error and does not represent a valid health value.\n    *   The maximum value for a 32-bit signed integer is **2³¹ - 1**.\n    *   `int.MaxValue` = **2,147,483,647**\n    *   This value represents the absolute highest number that can be stored as health for any NPC in the game. Even if the mathematical formula could produce a higher number with enough players, the game's code cannot store it. Therefore, this data type limit is the true \"theoretical maximum\" within the context of the game's source code.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nWhile the mathematical formula for health would approach infinity with infinite players, the game's source code imposes a hard cap due to the data type used for storing health. The theoretical maximum health is therefore the maximum value of a 32-bit signed integer.\n\n<<<2147483647>>>"
