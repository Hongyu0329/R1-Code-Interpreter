    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of contracted Gaussian functions for a 6-31G calculation of toluene (C7H8).\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the problem**\n\n*   **Molecule:** Toluene\n*   **Chemical Formula:** C7H8 (This means we have 7 Carbon atoms and 8 Hydrogen atoms).\n*   **Basis Set:** 6-31G\n*   **Goal:** To find the total number of **contracted Gaussian functions (CGFs)**.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the 6-31G basis set notation**\n\nThe 6-31G basis set is a Pople-style split-valence basis set. The notation can be broken down as follows:\n\n*   **`6-`**: This part describes the core atomic orbitals. Each core orbital is represented by a single contracted Gaussian function (CGF), which is formed by a linear combination of 6 primitive Gaussian functions (PGFs).\n*   **`-31G`**: This part describes the valence atomic orbitals. The valence shell is \"split\" into two basis functions for each valence atomic orbital.\n    *   The \"inner\" part of the valence shell is described by one CGF, which is a linear combination of 3 PGFs.\n    *   The \"outer\" part of the valence shell is described by another CGF, which is a linear combination of 1 PGF.\n*   **In summary:**\n    *   Each core atomic orbital gets 1 CGF.\n    *   Each valence atomic orbital gets 2 CGFs.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the number of CGFs per atom type (H and C)**\n\nWe need to identify the core and valence orbitals for both hydrogen and carbon.\n\n*   **For a Hydrogen (H) atom:**\n    *   **Atomic Orbitals:** Hydrogen has one electron in the 1s orbital (1s¹). It has **no core orbitals**.\n    *   **Valence Orbitals:** The 1s orbital is treated as a valence orbital.\n    *   **Applying the 6-31G rule:** Since 1s is a valence orbital, we apply the `-31G` part. This splits the single 1s orbital into two basis functions (two CGFs).\n    *   **CGFs per H atom = 2**\n\n*   **For a Carbon (C) atom:**\n    *   **Atomic Orbitals:** Carbon has the electron configuration 1s² 2s² 2p².\n    *   **Core Orbitals:** The 1s orbital is a core orbital. There is **1 core orbital**.\n    *   **Valence Orbitals:** The 2s and 2p orbitals are valence orbitals. The 2p subshell consists of three individual orbitals (2px, 2py, 2pz). Therefore, there is a total of **4 valence orbitals** (one 2s and three 2p).\n    *   **Applying the 6-31G rule:**\n        *   For the core orbital (1s): The `6-` rule applies. This gives **1 CGF**.\n        *   For the valence orbitals (2s, 2px, 2py, 2pz): The `-31G` rule applies. Each of the 4 valence orbitals is split into two CGFs. This gives 4 orbitals × 2 CGFs/orbital = **8 CGFs**.\n    *   **Total CGFs per C atom = 1 (core) + 8 (valence) = 9**\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the total number of CGFs for Toluene (C7H8)**\n\nNow we combine the results from the previous step with the number of atoms in the molecule.\n\n*   **Contribution from Carbon atoms:**\n    *   Number of C atoms = 7\n    *   CGFs per C atom = 9\n    *   Total from Carbon = 7 × 9 = 63 CGFs\n\n*   **Contribution from Hydrogen atoms:**\n    *   Number of H atoms = 8\n    *   CGFs per H atom = 2\n    *   Total from Hydrogen = 8 × 2 = 16 CGFs\n\n*   **Total for the molecule:**\n    *   Total CGFs = (Total from Carbon) + (Total from Hydrogen)\n    *   Total CGFs = 63 + 16 = 79\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n1.  **Contracted vs. Primitive Functions:** The question asks for **contracted** functions, not primitive ones. A contracted function is a fixed linear combination of primitive functions.\n2.  **Meaning of the Hyphen:** The hyphen in `6-31G` is crucial. It separates the treatment of core electrons from valence electrons.\n3.  **Split Valence:** The `31` part indicates that the valence shell is described by two basis functions of different sizes (\"inner\" and \"outer\"), allowing for more flexibility in describing chemical bonds.\n4.  **Counting Orbitals:** Remember that the `p` subshell contains three distinct orbitals (px, py, pz), and each must be accounted for.\n5.  **Applying Rules to the Right Atoms:** The rules for core/valence are specific to each element. Hydrogen has no core electrons, which simplifies its calculation.\n\n### Final Answer Calculation\n\n*   **Number of Carbon Atoms:** 7\n*   **Number of Hydrogen Atoms:** 8\n*   **CGFs per Carbon:** 9\n*   **CGFs per Hydrogen:** 2\n*   **Total CGFs:** (7 * 9) + (8 * 2) = 63 + 16 = 79\n\n<<<79>>>"
