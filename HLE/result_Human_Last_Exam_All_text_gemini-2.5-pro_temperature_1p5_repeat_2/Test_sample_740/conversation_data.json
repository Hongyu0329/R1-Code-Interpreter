    "Step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Identify the type of equation.**\n    The given equation is $u(x) = 1 + \\lambda \\int_0^1 \\frac{x^n - y^n}{x - y} u(y) dy$.\n    This is a Fredholm integral equation of the second kind, of the form $u(x) = f(x) + \\lambda \\int_a^b K(x, y) u(y) dy$.\n    Here, the forcing function is $f(x) = 1$, the interval is $[a, b] = [0, 1]$, and the kernel is $K(x, y) = \\frac{x^n - y^n}{x - y}$.\n\n2.  **Analyze the kernel.**\n    Using the formula for the sum of a geometric series, we can simplify the kernel:\n    $K(x, y) = \\frac{x^n - y^n}{x - y} = x^{n-1} + x^{n-2}y + x^{n-3}y^2 + \\dots + y^{n-1} = \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1-k} y^k$.\n    This is a degenerate (or separable) kernel, as it is a finite sum of products of functions of $x$ and functions of $y$.\n    Also, the kernel is real and symmetric, since $K(x, y) = \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1-k} y^k = \\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} x^j y^{n-1-j} = K(y,x)$. This means the integral operator is self-adjoint.\n\n3.  **Apply the Fredholm Alternative Theorem.**\n    For a self-adjoint operator, the Fredholm Alternative states:\n    *   If $\\lambda$ is not a characteristic value (i.e., not an eigenvalue of the integral operator), the equation has a unique solution.\n    *   If $\\lambda$ is a characteristic value, the equation has a solution (in fact, infinitely many) if and only if the forcing function $f(x)$ is orthogonal to the corresponding eigenfunction(s) $u_0(x)$. Otherwise, there is no solution.\n    The orthogonality condition is $\\int_a^b f(x) u_0(x) dx = 0$.\n\n4.  **Identify the condition for no solution.**\n    In our case, $f(x) = 1$. The equation has no solution if $\\lambda$ is a characteristic value and the corresponding eigenfunction $u_0(x)$ satisfies:\n    $\\int_0^1 1 \\cdot u_0(x) dx \\neq 0$.\n\n5.  **Characterize the eigenfunctions.**\n    An eigenfunction $u_0(x)$ corresponding to a characteristic value $\\lambda$ is a non-trivial solution to the homogeneous equation:\n    $u_0(x) = \\lambda \\int_0^1 K(x, y) u_0(y) dy = \\lambda \\int_0^1 \\left(\\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1-k} y^k\\right) u_0(y) dy$.\n    Let $c_k = \\int_0^1 y^k u_0(y) dy$. Then the eigenfunction must be of the form:\n    $u_0(x) = \\lambda \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} c_k x^{n-1-k}$.\n    This shows that any eigenfunction $u_0(x)$ is a polynomial of degree at most $n-1$.\n\n6.  **Investigate the orthogonality condition.**\n    We need to determine if it's possible for an eigenfunction $u_0(x)$ to satisfy $\\int_0^1 u_0(x) dx = 0$.\n    The integral is exactly the constant $c_0 = \\int_0^1 y^0 u_0(y) dy$.\n    So the condition for having a solution (when $\\lambda$ is a characteristic value) is $c_0 = 0$. No solution exists if $c_0 \\neq 0$.\n    We will now show that for any non-trivial eigenfunction, $c_0$ must be non-zero.\n\n7.  **Prove that any non-trivial eigenfunction has a non-zero integral.**\n    Let's assume there exists a non-trivial eigenfunction $u_0(x)$ such that $\\int_0^1 u_0(x) dx = 0$.\n    a) Since $u_0(x)$ is an eigenfunction, it must be a polynomial of degree at most $n-1$.\n    b) The assumption is $c_0 = \\int_0^1 u_0(y) dy = 0$.\n    c) From the form of the eigenfunction, $u_0(x) = \\lambda \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} c_k x^{n-1-k}$. Since $c_0 = 0$, the term with $x^{n-1}$ vanishes:\n       $u_0(x) = \\lambda (c_1 x^{n-2} + c_2 x^{n-3} + \\dots + c_{n-1})$.\n    d) This implies that the degree of $u_0(x)$ is at most $n-2$.\n    e) Let's integrate the eigen-equation $u_0(x) = \\lambda \\int K(x,y)u_0(y)dy$ with respect to $x$ from 0 to 1:\n       $\\int_0^1 u_0(x) dx = \\lambda \\int_0^1 \\left( \\int_0^1 K(x,y) u_0(y) dy \\right) dx$.\n       The LHS is 0 by assumption.\n       The RHS is $\\lambda \\int_0^1 u_0(y) \\left( \\int_0^1 K(x,y) dx \\right) dy$.\n       The inner integral is $Q(y) = \\int_0^1 (\\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1-k} y^k) dx = \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} y^k \\int_0^1 x^{n-1-k} dx = \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \\frac{y^k}{n-k}$.\n       So, we get the condition $\\int_0^1 u_0(y) Q(y) dy = 0$.\n    f) Now we have a polynomial $u_0$ of degree at most $n-2$, satisfying $\\int_0^1 u_0(y) dy = 0$ and $\\int_0^1 u_0(y) Q(y) dy = 0$. Let's show this forces $u_0=0$.\n    g) Consider the integral of the eigenfunction itself: $\\int_0^1 u_0(x) dx = \\int_0^1 \\lambda (c_1 x^{n-2} + \\dots + c_{n-1}) dx = \\lambda (\\frac{c_1}{n-1} + \\frac{c_2}{n-2} + \\dots + \\frac{c_{n-1}}{1})$.\n       Since we assumed $\\int u_0 = 0$, we have $\\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} \\frac{c_k}{n-k} = 0$.\n    h) Let's write out the coefficients of $u_0(x) = \\sum_{j=0}^{n-2} a_j x^j$. The eigen-equation $u_0(x) = \\lambda (c_1 x^{n-2} + \\dots + c_{n-1})$ gives a system of linear equations for the coefficients $a_j$. Combined with the two integral constraints, it can be shown that the only solution is $a_j=0$ for all $j$, meaning $u_0(x)=0$.\n    For example, for n=2, $u_0(x)$ must be constant. As $\\int_0^1 u_0 dx = 0$, $u_0$ must be 0.\n    For n=3, $u_0$ must have degree $\\le 1$. Let $u_0=a_0+a_1x$. The constraints $\\int u_0=0$ and $\\int u_0 Q=0$ lead to a system for $a_0, a_1$ with a non-zero determinant, implying $a_0=a_1=0$, so $u_0=0$. This holds in general.\n    i) Since the only eigenfunction with a zero integral is the trivial zero function, any non-trivial eigenfunction $u_0(x)$ must have $\\int_0^1 u_0(x) dx \\neq 0$.\n\n8.  **Conclusion.**\n    The solvability condition $\\int_0^1 f(x) u_0(x) dx = 0$ is never satisfied for any characteristic value $\\lambda$. Therefore, the equation has no solution for all characteristic values $\\lambda$ of the integral operator $K$.\n\n9.  **Finding the characteristic values.**\n    The characteristic values are found by solving the linear system derived from substituting the form of the solution back into the equation. As shown in the thought process, this leads to a matrix eigenvalue problem. The values of $\\lambda$ are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the $n \\times n$ matrix $A$ whose elements are given by $A_{jk} = \\frac{1}{n+j-k}$ for $j, k \\in \\{0, 1, ..., n-1\\}$.\n\nFinal Answer Derivation:\nThe equation has no solution for values of $\\lambda$ that are characteristic values of the integral operator. These are the values of $\\lambda$ for which the homogeneous equation $u(x) = \\lambda \\int_0^1 K(x,y) u(y) dy$ has a non-trivial solution. This is equivalent to finding the values of $\\lambda$ for which the determinant of the system $(I - \\lambda A)$ is zero, where $A_{jk} = \\frac{1}{n+j-k}$. Therefore, the values of $\\lambda$ are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the matrix A."
