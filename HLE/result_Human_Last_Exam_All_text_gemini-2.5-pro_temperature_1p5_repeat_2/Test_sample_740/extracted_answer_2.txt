The equation has no solution for values of $\lambda$ that are characteristic values of the integral operator. These are the values of $\lambda$ for which the homogeneous equation $u(x) = \lambda \int_0^1 K(x,y) u(y) dy$ has a non-trivial solution. This is equivalent to finding the values of $\lambda$ for which the determinant of the system $(I - \lambda A)$ is zero, where $A_{jk} = \frac{1}{n+j-k}$. Therefore, the values of $\lambda$ are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the matrix A.
