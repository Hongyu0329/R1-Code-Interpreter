    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the scansion for the line \"et tibi bene esse soli quom sibi sit male\".\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Line and Meter:** The line is from Plautus's play *Mercator*. Based on its length (15 syllables) and the common meters used by Plautus, it is a **Trochaic Septenarius**. This meter consists of seven trochaic feet (pattern: Long-Short or L S) followed by a final, incomplete foot of a single syllable (catalexis). The typical structure is:\n    `L S | L S | L S | L S || L S | L S | L S | L^`\n    A double bar (||) often marks a caesura, or pause, after the fourth foot. In Plautine comedy, many substitutions and resolutions are allowed, which makes the scansion complex.\n\n2.  **Syllabification and Basic Quantities:** First, we determine the natural length of each syllable and any lengthening by position.\n    *   A syllable is long by position if its vowel is followed by two or more consonants (e.g., the `et` in `et tibi` or the `sit` in `sit male`).\n    *   `et`: Long (L) by position before the 't' of `tibi`.\n    *   `ti-bi`: Naturally Short-Long (S L), as the final 'i' (`ī`) is long.\n    *   `be-ne`: Naturally Short-Short (S S).\n    *   `es-se`: Long-Short (L S). The first syllable, `es-`, is long by position because of the double '-ss-'.\n    *   `so-li`: Naturally Long-Long (L L), as both `ō` and `ī` are long vowels.\n    *   `quom`: (An archaic spelling of `cum`). Long (L) by position before the 's' of `sibi`.\n    *   `si-bi`: Naturally Short-Short (S S).\n    *   `sit`: Long (L) by position before the 'm' of `male`.\n    *   `ma-le`: Naturally Short-Short (S S).\n\n3.  **Applying Metrical Rules and Fitting to Feet:** Now, we fit the sequence of syllables into the trochaic meter, applying Plautine rules where necessary. The sequence of quantities is: `L S L S S L S L L L S S L S S`.\n\n    *   **Foot 1:** `et ti` -> `L S`. This is a perfect **trochee**.\n    *   **Foot 2:** `bi be` -> `L S`. This is also a perfect **trochee**, using the naturally long `ī` of `tibi` and the short `e` of `bene`.\n    *   **Foot 3:** `ne es se` -> `S L S`. This sequence doesn't form a standard foot. Here we must apply a Plautine rule known as *brevis brevians* (or Iambic Shortening). A long syllable (`es-`) that is part of an iambic sequence (`-ne es-`) and is not under the main beat of the foot can be shortened. This resolves the foot `ne esse` from `S L S` into a **tribrach** (`S S S`), which is a valid substitution for a trochee.\n    *   **Foot 4:** `so li` -> `L L`. This is a **spondee**, a very common substitution for a trochee. The main caesura of the line falls after this foot.\n    *   **Foot 5:** `quom si` -> `L S`. This is a perfect **trochee**.\n    *   **Foot 6:** `bi sit` -> `S L`. This is an **iamb**. In Plautus, an iamb is a permitted substitution for a trochee.\n    *   **Foot 7 (and Catalexis):** `ma le` -> `S S`. We are left with two short syllables at the end of the line. This is a common resolution of the final catalectic foot. Instead of a single final long syllable, we have a **pyrrhic** (`S S`).\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Meter Identification:** Correctly identifying the meter as a Trochaic Septenarius is the crucial first step. An incorrect assumption (like Iambic Senarius) makes the line impossible to scan.\n*   **Plautine Rules:** Standard classical scansion rules are insufficient. One must account for rules prevalent in early Latin comedy, such as *brevis brevians* and the wide range of acceptable substitutions (spondee, tribrach, iamb) and resolutions.\n*   **Positional Lengthening:** Be careful to check for consonants in the *next* word when determining if a syllable is long by position (e.g., `sit male`).\n*   **Word Boundaries:** Feet do not need to align with word boundaries. In fact, the way feet break across words (`et ti-bi be-ne`) is a key part of the verse's rhythm.\n*   **Resolved Endings:** The end of a line in Plautus can be \"resolved\" into two short syllables (`S S`) instead of the expected single syllable.\n\n### Final Scansion\n\nGrouping the syllables into the feet as analyzed above gives the final answer.\n\n<<<L S L S S S S L L L S S L S S>>>"
