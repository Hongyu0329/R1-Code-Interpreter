    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Question**\nThe core of the question is to find the maximum value of `m`, where `m` is the number of distinct integers `k` for which `K_k` (a complete graph of size `k`) appears as an induced subgraph in a single graph `G` with `n = 128` vertices.\n\n*   **Graph `G` on `n=128` vertices:** The graph has `V(G)` as its set of vertices, with `|V(G)| = 128`.\n*   **Clique of size `k` (`K_k`):** A graph with `k` vertices where every vertex is connected to every other vertex.\n*   **Induced Subgraph:** For a subset of vertices `S` from `V(G)`, the induced subgraph `G[S]` consists of the vertices `S` and *all* the edges present in `G` that connect any two vertices within `S`.\n*   **Simultaneously appear:** The graph `G` must be rich enough in its structure to contain all these different induced subgraphs at the same time. This does not mean the vertex sets for these subgraphs must be disjoint.\n\n**2. Relate \"Induced `K_k`\" to \"Clique\"**\nThe condition that a graph `G` has an induced subgraph isomorphic to `K_k` is equivalent to saying that there exists a subset of `k` vertices in `G` where every pair of vertices in the subset is connected by an edge. This is precisely the definition of a `k`-clique.\nSo, the problem asks for the maximum number of different clique sizes a graph on 128 vertices can have.\n\n**3. Characterize the Set of Clique Sizes**\nLet `ω(G)` be the clique number of a graph `G`, which is defined as the size of the largest clique in `G`.\nIf a graph `G` contains a clique of size `k` (let's call the vertex set for this clique `S`), then any subset of `S` of size `j` (where `1 ≤ j < k`) is also a clique. This is because if all vertices in `S` are mutually connected, then all vertices in any subset of `S` are also mutually connected.\nThis leads to a crucial insight: If a graph has a clique of size `ω(G)`, it must also have cliques of all sizes `k` for `1 ≤ k ≤ ω(G)`.\nTherefore, the set of all possible clique sizes in any graph `G` is not an arbitrary collection of numbers, but is always the continuous set of integers `{1, 2, 3, ..., ω(G)}`.\n\n**4. Connect the Number of Sizes to the Clique Number**\nFrom the previous step, the number of different clique sizes that can appear in a graph `G` is the cardinality of the set `{1, 2, ..., ω(G)}`, which is exactly `ω(G)`.\n\n**5. Restate the Problem**\nThe original question can now be simplified to: What is the maximum possible clique number, `ω(G)`, for a graph `G` on `n = 128` vertices?\n\n**6. Find the Maximum Clique Number**\nThe size of a clique is the number of vertices in it. A clique is a subset of the graph's vertices. Therefore, the size of any clique cannot exceed the total number of vertices in the graph.\nFor `n = 128`, the maximum possible size for a clique is 128.\n`ω(G) ≤ n = 128`.\n\n**7. Demonstrate Achievability**\nWe must show that this maximum value of 128 is actually achievable for a graph on 128 vertices.\nConsider the complete graph `G = K_{128}`. In this graph, every vertex is connected to every other vertex. The set of all 128 vertices forms a clique of size 128. Thus, for this graph, `ω(K_{128}) = 128`.\nAs established in Step 3, this graph contains cliques of all sizes from 1 to 128. For any `k` between 1 and 128, we can simply choose any `k` vertices from `K_{128}`, and they will form an induced `K_k`.\nThis construction proves that a maximum of 128 different clique sizes is possible.\n\n### Summary of Careful Points\n*   The phrase \"simultaneously appear\" does not imply that the vertex sets for the different clique sizes must be disjoint.\n*   The key insight is that the existence of a `k`-clique implies the existence of a `j`-clique for all `1 ≤ j < k`.\n*   This insight simplifies the problem from counting a set of induced subgraphs to finding the maximum possible value of a standard graph parameter: the clique number `ω(G)`.\n*   The maximum clique number for a graph on `n` vertices is trivially `n`, and this is achieved by the complete graph `K_n`.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe problem is to find the maximum number of different clique sizes `k` for which `K_k` exists as an induced subgraph in a graph `G` with 128 vertices. The set of all possible clique sizes in any graph `G` is `{1, 2, ..., ω(G)}`, where `ω(G)` is the size of the largest clique. The number of different sizes is therefore `ω(G)`. We need to maximize `ω(G)` for a graph on 128 vertices. The clique number of a graph cannot exceed the number of its vertices, so `ω(G) ≤ 128`. This maximum is achieved by the complete graph `K_{128}`, which has a clique number of 128 and thus contains induced cliques of all sizes from 1 to 128. Therefore, the maximum possible number of different clique sizes is 128.\n\n<<<128>>>"
