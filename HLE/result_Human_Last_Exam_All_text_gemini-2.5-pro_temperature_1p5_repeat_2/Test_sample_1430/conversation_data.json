    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the smallest and largest possible rank of the Neron-Severi group of X.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the objects and the question**\n\n*   **C:** A compact Riemann surface of genus $g=3$. By the Riemann-Roch theorem and embedding theorems, any such surface is a projective algebraic curve.\n*   **X = C^(15):** The 15th symmetric power of C, which is the space of effective divisors of degree 15 on C. X is a smooth complex projective variety of dimension 15.\n*   **Neron-Severi Group NS(X):** The group of algebraic divisor classes on X modulo algebraic equivalence. It is a finitely generated free abelian group.\n*   **Rank of NS(X):** This is the Picard number of X, denoted by $\\rho(X)$. We need to find the minimum and maximum possible values of $\\rho(X)$ as C varies over all genus 3 curves.\n\n**Step 2: Relate the Picard number of X to the Jacobian of C**\n\nA fundamental result in the theory of algebraic curves relates the cohomology and the Picard number of symmetric powers of a curve to its Jacobian variety. The Jacobian of C, denoted J(C), is a g-dimensional abelian variety that parameterizes degree 0 line bundles on C.\n\nFor a curve C of genus g and its n-th symmetric power $C^{(n)}$, there is a well-known formula for the Picard number when n is sufficiently large.\n**Theorem (Macdonald, Beauville):** If $n \\ge 2g-2$, then the Picard number of the n-th symmetric power is given by:\n$\\rho(C^{(n)}) = \\rho(J(C)) + 1$.\n\nIn our problem, $C$ has genus $g=3$, and we are considering the 15th symmetric power, so $n=15$. We check the condition:\n$n = 15 \\ge 2g-2 = 2(3)-2 = 4$.\nThe condition is satisfied. Therefore, we can use the formula:\n$\\rho(X) = \\rho(C^{(15)}) = \\rho(J(C)) + 1$.\n\nThis formula tells us that the variation in $\\rho(X)$ is entirely determined by the variation in $\\rho(J(C))$. Our problem is now reduced to finding the smallest and largest possible values of the Picard number of the Jacobian of a genus 3 curve.\n\n**Step 3: Find the smallest possible rank of NS(J(C))**\n\n*   $J(C)$ is a 3-dimensional principally polarized abelian variety. The principal polarization gives rise to the theta divisor, which is an ample divisor on $J(C)$. The class of this divisor is always present in $NS(J(C))$, so $\\rho(J(C)) \\ge 1$.\n*   For a \"very general\" curve $C$ in the moduli space of genus 3 curves $M_3$, the Jacobian $J(C)$ has no extra endomorphisms beyond the integers. That is, its endomorphism ring is $\\text{End}(J(C)) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n*   In this generic case, the Neron-Severi group $NS(J(C))$ is generated by the class of the theta divisor. Therefore, its rank is 1.\n*   Thus, the smallest possible rank is $\\rho_{min}(J(C)) = 1$.\n\n**Step 4: Find the largest possible rank of NS(J(C))**\n\n*   The Picard number of a projective variety is bounded by its (1,1)-Hodge number. For a g-dimensional abelian variety A, the Hodge number $h^{1,1}(A) = g^2$.\n*   For $J(C)$, which is 3-dimensional, we have the upper bound: $\\rho(J(C)) \\le h^{1,1}(J(C)) = 3^2 = 9$.\n*   This maximum value is achieved for certain special abelian varieties known as \"singular\" abelian varieties or abelian varieties of CM-type (Complex Multiplication). For such varieties, the Hodge conjecture is known, and it implies that every Hodge class of type (1,1) is algebraic, so $\\rho(A) = h^{1,1}(A)$.\n*   For a 3-dimensional abelian variety $A$, $\\rho(A)=9$ if and only if $A$ is isomorphic to a product of three mutually isogenous elliptic curves, each having complex multiplication.\n*   We must ensure that such an abelian variety can be the Jacobian of a genus 3 curve. Indeed, there are such curves. A prime example is the **Fermat quartic curve**, defined by the projective equation $x^4 + y^4 + z^4 = 0$. This is a non-hyperelliptic curve of genus 3. Its Jacobian is known to be isogenous to the cube of an elliptic curve with CM by the ring of Gaussian integers $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$. For this Jacobian, the Picard number is maximal: $\\rho(J(C)) = 9$.\n*   Therefore, the largest possible rank is $\\rho_{max}(J(C)) = 9$.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the final answer for X**\n\nNow we substitute the minimum and maximum values for $\\rho(J(C))$ back into the formula from Step 2.\n\n*   **Smallest rank of NS(X):**\n    $\\rho_{min}(X) = \\rho_{min}(J(C)) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2$.\n\n*   **Largest rank of NS(X):**\n    $\\rho_{max}(X) = \\rho_{max}(J(C)) + 1 = 9 + 1 = 10$.\n\nThus, the rank of the Neron-Severi group of X can range from 2 to 10.\n\n<<<The smallest possible rank is 2 and the largest possible rank is 10.>>>"
