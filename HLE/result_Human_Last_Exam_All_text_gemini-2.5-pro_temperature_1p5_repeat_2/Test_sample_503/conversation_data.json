    "An internal adjunction in a 2-category from an object $X$ to an object $Y$ is a pair of 1-morphisms $L: X \\to Y$ and $R: Y \\to X$, along with 2-morphisms $\\eta: \\mathrm{id}_X \\to R \\circ L$ (the unit) and $\\varepsilon: L \\circ R \\to \\mathrm{id}_Y$ (the counit), that satisfy the triangle identities.\n\nStep-by-step analysis:\n1.  **Understand the 2-category $\\Delta$.** The problem states that $\\Delta$ is the simplex category, viewed as a locally posetal 2-subcategory of $\\mathsf{Pos}$.\n    *   The objects of $\\Delta$ are the finite ordinals $[n] = \\{0, 1, \\dots, n\\}$ for $n \\ge 0$. In our case, the objects are $[23]$ and $[37]$.\n    *   The 1-morphisms between objects $[m]$ and $[n]$ are the order-preserving maps $f: [m] \\to [n]$. So we have $L: [23] \\to [37]$ and $R: [37] \\to [23]$ which are order-preserving maps.\n    *   The structure is that of a locally posetal 2-category. This means that for any two parallel 1-morphisms $f, g: [m] \\to [n]$, there is at most one 2-morphism in each direction. The 2-morphism $f \\to g$ exists if and only if $f(i) \\le g(i)$ for all $i \\in [m]$.\n\n2.  **Translate the definition of an adjunction.** We need to find the number of pairs of order-preserving maps $(L, R)$ that satisfy the conditions for an adjunction.\n    *   $L: [23] \\to [37]$\n    *   $R: [37] \\to [23]$\n    *   The unit $\\eta: \\mathrm{id}_{[23]} \\to R \\circ L$ requires that for all $i \\in [23]$, $\\mathrm{id}_{[23]}(i) \\le (R \\circ L)(i)$, which simplifies to $i \\le R(L(i))$.\n    *   The counit $\\varepsilon: L \\circ R \\to \\mathrm{id}_{[37]}$ requires that for all $j \\in [37]$, $(L \\circ R)(j) \\le \\mathrm{id}_{[37]}(j)$, which simplifies to $L(R(j)) \\le j$.\n    *   These two conditions, $i \\le R(L(i))$ and $L(R(j)) \\le j$, along with $L$ and $R$ being order-preserving, define a (monotone) Galois connection between the posets $[23]$ and $[37]$.\n    *   In a poset-enriched category (like a locally posetal 2-category), the triangle identities for the unit and counit are always satisfied if the unit and counit exist. Therefore, we only need to count the number of pairs $(L, R)$ forming a Galois connection.\n\n3.  **Count the number of Galois connections.** A well-known result in lattice theory states that for two complete lattices $P$ and $Q$, a map $L: P \\to Q$ has a right adjoint $R: Q \\to P$ if and only if $L$ preserves all suprema (joins). The posets $[m]$ are finite total orders, hence they are complete lattices.\n    *   An order-preserving map $L: [m] \\to [n]$ preserves all non-empty suprema (which are just maxima) automatically. For the empty set, we require $L(\\sup \\emptyset) = \\sup L(\\emptyset)$. In $[m]$, $\\sup \\emptyset$ is the minimum element, which is 0. In $[n]$, $\\sup L(\\emptyset) = \\sup \\emptyset$ is also 0. So, the condition for $L$ to be a left adjoint is $L(0) = 0$.\n    *   Dually, an order-preserving map $R: [n] \\to [m]$ is a right adjoint if and only if it preserves all infima, which is equivalent to the condition $R(n) = m$.\n    *   For every order-preserving map $L: [23] \\to [37]$ with $L(0)=0$, there exists a unique right adjoint $R$. Conversely, for every order-preserving map $R: [37] \\to [23]$ with $R(37)=23$, there exists a unique left adjoint $L$. This establishes a bijection between the set of adjunctions and the set of such maps $L$ (or $R$).\n\n4.  **Perform the combinatorial calculation.** We can count the number of such maps $L$. We need to count the number of order-preserving maps $L: [23] \\to [37]$ such that $L(0)=0$.\n    *   An order-preserving map is determined by the sequence of its values. We must have $L(0) \\le L(1) \\le \\dots \\le L(23)$.\n    *   The condition $L(0)=0$ fixes the first value. The condition becomes $0 = L(0) \\le L(1) \\le \\dots \\le L(23) \\le 37$.\n    *   So we need to choose the values for $L(1), L(2), \\dots, L(23)$. This is a sequence of 23 integers $y_i = L(i)$ such that $0 \\le y_1 \\le y_2 \\le \\dots \\le y_{23} \\le 37$.\n    *   This is a classic stars and bars problem. It is equivalent to choosing 23 numbers from the set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 37\\}$ with replacement. The size of this set is $37 - 0 + 1 = 38$.\n    *   The number of ways to choose $k$ items from a set of size $n$ with replacement is given by the multiset coefficient $\\left(\\!\\!{n \\choose k}\\!\\!\\right) = \\binom{n+k-1}{k}$.\n    *   Here, $n=38$ (the number of possible values) and $k=23$ (the number of values to choose).\n    *   The number of adjunctions is $\\binom{38+23-1}{23} = \\binom{60}{23}$.\n\n5.  **Calculate the final value.**\n    *   $\\binom{60}{23} = \\frac{60!}{23!(60-23)!} = \\frac{60!}{23!37!}$.\n    *   Calculating this value gives:\n    $\\binom{60}{23} = 40,225,345,056,910,220$.\n\nLet's double check using the right adjoint side. We count order-preserving maps $R: [37] \\to [23]$ with $R(37)=23$.\n*   We need to choose a sequence $R(0), \\dots, R(36)$ such that $0 \\le R(0) \\le \\dots \\le R(36) \\le 23$.\n*   This is choosing 37 numbers from the set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 23\\}$ (size 24) with replacement.\n*   The number is $\\binom{24+37-1}{37} = \\binom{60}{37}$.\n*   Since $\\binom{60}{37} = \\binom{60}{60-37} = \\binom{60}{23}$, the result is consistent.\n\nThe number of internal adjunctions is $\\binom{60}{23}$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\binom{60}{23} = 40225345056910220$.\n\n<<<40225345056910220>>>"
