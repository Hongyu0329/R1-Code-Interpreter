The ideal Ni/Ce atomic ratio depends on the reaction. For the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction, the ideal ratio is approximately 1.0 to maximize active sites. For high-temperature thermochemical Water Splitting (WS), the ideal ratio is much lower, around 0.1, to ensure thermal stability and effective doping.
