A finite nilpotent group G is a filled group if and only if each of its Sylow p-subgroups `S_p` belongs to the following list:
1. `S_p` is cyclic (`C_{p^n}` for `n ≥ 1`).
2. `p=2` and `S_2` is a dihedral group `D_{2^n}` for `n ≥ 2`, a generalized quaternion group `Q_{2^n}` for `n ≥ 3`, or a semidihedral group `S_{2^n}` for `n ≥ 4`.
3. `p` is an odd prime and `S_p` is a non-abelian group of order `p³` and exponent `p`.
