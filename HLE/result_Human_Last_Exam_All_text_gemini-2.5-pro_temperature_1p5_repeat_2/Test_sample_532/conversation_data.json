    "This problem requires a careful understanding of the definitions and relies on a known classification theorem from group theory.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Definitions**\n\n*   **Finite Group (G):** A group with a finite number of elements.\n*   **Product-Free Set (S):** A non-empty subset `S` of a group `G` is product-free if for all `x, y ∈ S`, the product `xy` is not in `S`. This can be written as `S² ∩ S = ∅`, where `S² = {ab | a, b ∈ S}`.\n*   **Maximum by Inclusion Product-Free (MIPF) Set:** A product-free set `S` such that it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set. In other words, for any element `g ∈ G \\ S`, the set `S ∪ {g}` is not product-free.\n*   **Filled Group:** The question states a group `G` is filled if the union of all its MIPF sets equals `G`.\n*   **Nilpotent Group:** A finite group is nilpotent if and only if it is the direct product of its Sylow p-subgroups.\n\n**Step 2: A Critical Point in the Definition of a \"Filled Group\"**\n\nLet `G` be a non-trivial group (i.e., `|G| > 1`) and let `e` be its identity element.\n1.  Consider any subset `S ⊆ G` that contains the identity element `e`.\n2.  If `e ∈ S`, we can take `x = e` and `y = e`. Both are in `S`.\n3.  Their product is `xy = e * e = e`.\n4.  Since `e` is in `S`, this means `S² ∩ S` is not empty (it contains `e`).\n5.  Therefore, any subset containing the identity element is not product-free.\n6.  This implies that no MIPF set can contain the identity element `e`.\n7.  Consequently, the union of all MIPF sets in `G` is always a subset of `G \\ {e}`.\n8.  According to the strict definition provided in the question, for the group to be \"filled\", this union must be equal to `G`. This is only possible if `G` has no identity element, which is impossible for a group. Or if G is the trivial group `{e}`, for which the only MIPF set is the empty set, so it is not filled.\n\nThis apparent contradiction implies that the term \"filled group\" is a technical shorthand. In the literature where this term was introduced (by V. A. Belonogov), a group `G` is called **filled** if the union of all its maximal product-free sets is equal to `G \\ {e}`. This is the definition we must use to solve the problem.\nThe set of elements not contained in any MIPF set is often denoted `K(G)`. The problem is therefore equivalent to finding all finite nilpotent groups `G` for which `K(G) = {e}`.\n\n**Step 3: Reducing the Problem for Nilpotent Groups**\n\nA finite nilpotent group `G` is the direct product of its Sylow p-subgroups:\n`G = P₁ × P₂ × ... × Pₖ`\nwhere `Pᵢ` is the Sylow `pᵢ`-subgroup of `G` for distinct primes `pᵢ`.\n\nA key result in this area states that for a direct product of groups `A` and `B` with coprime orders, `K(A × B) = K(A) × K(B)`. Applying this to a nilpotent group, we get:\n`K(G) = K(P₁) × K(P₂) × ... × K(Pₖ)`\n\nFor `K(G)` to be the trivial subgroup `{e_G}`, it is necessary and sufficient that `K(Pᵢ)` is the trivial subgroup `{e_{Pᵢ}}` for each Sylow subgroup `Pᵢ`.\nTherefore, a nilpotent group `G` is filled if and only if each of its Sylow p-subgroups is a filled p-group.\nThe problem is now reduced to identifying all finite filled p-groups.\n\n**Step 4: Classification of Filled p-Groups**\n\nThe classification of finite filled p-groups is a known result in group theory. A finite p-group `P` is filled (i.e., `K(P) = {e}`) if and only if it belongs to one of the following families:\n\n1.  **Cyclic p-groups:** `P` is a cyclic group `C_{p^n}` for any prime `p` and any integer `n ≥ 1`.\n2.  **Specific 2-groups:** If `p = 2`, `P` can also be one of the following non-cyclic groups:\n    *   The dihedral group `D_{2^n}` for `n ≥ 2`. (Note: `D_4` is isomorphic to `C₂ × C₂`).\n    *   The generalized quaternion group `Q_{2^n}` for `n ≥ 3`.\n    *   The semidihedral (or quasidihedral) group `S_{2^n}` for `n ≥ 4`.\n3.  **Specific p-groups for p > 2:** If `p` is an odd prime, `P` can be a non-abelian group of order `p³` and exponent `p`. (For each odd prime `p`, there is one such group up to isomorphism).\n\n**Step 5: Final Answer Synthesis**\n\nCombining the results from Step 3 and Step 4, we can characterize all finite filled nilpotent groups. A finite nilpotent group `G` is filled if and only if it is a direct product of filled p-groups, where each Sylow p-subgroup in its decomposition belongs to the list identified in Step 4.\n\n***\n\n### Final Answer\nA finite nilpotent group G is a filled group if and only if it is a direct product of its Sylow p-subgroups, `G = S_{p_1} × S_{p_2} × ... × S_{p_k}`, where each Sylow `p`-subgroup `S_p` is a filled `p`-group. The complete list of filled `p`-groups is as follows:\n\n1.  **For any prime `p`**:\n    *   Any cyclic `p`-group, `C_{p^n}` for `n ≥ 1`.\n\n2.  **For the prime `p = 2`**, in addition to cyclic groups, the following are also filled:\n    *   Dihedral groups `D_{2^n}` for `n ≥ 2`. (Note that for `n=2`, this is `D_4 ≅ C₂ × C₂`).\n    *   Generalized quaternion groups `Q_{2^n}` for `n ≥ 3`.\n    *   Semidihedral groups `S_{2^n}` for `n ≥ 4`.\n\n3.  **For any odd prime `p`**, in addition to cyclic groups, the following are also filled:\n    *   The non-abelian groups of order `p³` and exponent `p`.\n\nIn summary, a finite nilpotent group is filled if and only if each of its Sylow subgroups appears on this list.\n\n<<<A finite nilpotent group G is a filled group if and only if each of its Sylow p-subgroups `S_p` belongs to the following list:\n1. `S_p` is cyclic (`C_{p^n}` for `n ≥ 1`).\n2. `p=2` and `S_2` is a dihedral group `D_{2^n}` for `n ≥ 2`, a generalized quaternion group `Q_{2^n}` for `n ≥ 3`, or a semidihedral group `S_{2^n}` for `n ≥ 4`.\n3. `p` is an odd prime and `S_p` is a non-abelian group of order `p³` and exponent `p`.>>>"
