    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the correct answer.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the question into key informational components.**\nThe question provides several distinct clues to identify a specific person:\n1.  The person is a **physicist**.\n2.  They are **better known for work in the microscopy field**.\n3.  They discovered an **optical effect in real imagery**.\n4.  The discovery was initiated by an **accidental observation by a custodial worker**.\n5.  This observation involved **cleaning concave mirrors**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze each clue and list careful points.**\n\n*   **Clue 1: Physicist:** The answer must be an individual formally recognized as a physicist, not just a scientist or inventor in a related field.\n*   **Clue 2: Better known for microscopy:** This is a strong pointer. We should think of major advancements in microscopy. Key names include Ernst Abbe (diffraction limit), George Nomarski (DIC microscopy), and Frits Zernike (phase-contrast microscopy).\n*   **Clue 3: Optical effect in real imagery:** This refers to a phenomenon related to how images are formed, specifically real images that can be projected. The work of the candidates mentioned in the previous point (Abbe, Nomarski, Zernike) all relate directly to improving the real image formed by a microscope's objective lens.\n*   **Clue 4 & 5: The anecdote of the custodial worker and concave mirrors:** This is the most specific and unique piece of information. It's a historical detail that can pinpoint the exact discovery and person. A \"concave mirror\" in a high-end optics lab is often a component of a larger instrument, such as a spectrometer which uses a concave diffraction grating.\n\n**Step 3: Synthesize the clues to find the correct physicist.**\n\nLet's focus on the most unique clue: the story of the accidental discovery. This specific anecdote is famously associated with the Dutch physicist **Frits Zernike**.\n\n*   The story goes that Zernike was working with a concave diffraction grating (a mirror with finely ruled lines used to separate light into a spectrum). These gratings produce \"ghost\" images due to imperfections in the ruling process.\n*   Zernike noticed that these normally invisible grating lines themselves could be seen under certain conditions. The anecdote states this was first pointed out by a technician or cleaner who was dusting the grating. The dust scattered light in just the right way to make phase differences visible as brightness differences.\n*   Zernike realized that light diffracted by the grating lines was out of phase with the undiffracted, reflected light. The human eye cannot see these phase differences. He then conceived of a method to convert these invisible phase shifts into visible amplitude (brightness) shifts.\n*   This insight led directly to his invention of the **phase-contrast microscope**. This invention was revolutionary because it allowed scientists to study unstained, transparent living cells for the first time, as small differences in refractive index within the cell created the phase shifts that his microscope could make visible.\n\n**Step 4: Verify the answer against all parts of the question.**\n\n*   **Is Frits Zernike a physicist?** Yes, he won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1953 for this discovery.\n*   **Is he better known for microscopy?** Yes, the phase-contrast microscope is his most celebrated achievement and a cornerstone of modern biological microscopy.\n*   **Did he discover an optical effect in real imagery?** Yes, phase contrast is a method for manipulating light in an imaging system (a microscope) to render invisible phase objects visible in the final real image.\n*   **Does the anecdote match?** Yes, the core elements of the story—the accidental observation during cleaning/dusting of a concave optical element (the diffraction grating)—are hallmarks of the Zernike discovery story.\n\nBased on this step-by-step analysis, all clues point definitively to Frits Zernike.\n\n<<<Frits Zernike>>>"
