    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the connectivity of the map $\\phi: \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the spaces and the map**\n\n*   **Source Space:** $X = \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$. Using the general homotopy equivalence for the join operation ($A * B \\simeq \\Sigma(A \\wedge B)$), the source space is homotopy equivalent to the join of two loop spaces: $X \\simeq \\Omega S^4 * \\Omega S^6$.\n*   **Target Space:** $Y = \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$. Since the smash product of spheres $S^4 \\wedge S^6$ is homeomorphic to $S^{10}$, the target space is $Y = \\Omega S^{10}$.\n*   **The Map:** The map $\\phi: \\Omega S^4 * \\Omega S^6 \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$ is a well-known map in homotopy theory, often called the generalized Hopf invariant map or the Whitehead-Samelson product map.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the connectivity of the source and target spaces**\n\nTo understand the map, we first need to know the connectivity of the spaces involved. The connectivity of a space is the largest integer $k$ such that all homotopy groups $\\pi_i$ are trivial for $1 \\le i \\le k$.\n\n*   **Connectivity of $\\Omega S^n$:** The loop space $\\Omega S^n$ is $(n-2)$-connected.\n    *   $\\Omega S^4$ is $(4-2)=2$-connected. Its first non-trivial homotopy group is $\\pi_3(\\Omega S^4) = \\pi_4(S^4) = \\mathbb{Z}$.\n    *   $\\Omega S^6$ is $(6-2)=4$-connected. Its first non-trivial homotopy group is $\\pi_5(\\Omega S^6) = \\pi_6(S^6) = \\mathbb{Z}$.\n*   **Connectivity of the Source Space $X$:**\n    1.  First, we find the connectivity of the smash product $\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6$. If two spaces $A$ and $B$ are $c_A$-connected and $c_B$-connected respectively, their smash product $A \\wedge B$ is $(c_A + c_B + 1)$-connected.\n    2.  For $A=\\Omega S^4$ (2-connected) and $B=\\Omega S^6$ (4-connected), their smash product $A \\wedge B$ is $(2+4+1) = 7$-connected.\n    3.  The source space is the suspension of this smash product, $X = \\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$. Suspension increases connectivity by one.\n    4.  Therefore, the source space $X$ is $(7+1) = 8$-connected. Its first non-trivial homotopy group is $\\pi_9(X) \\cong \\pi_8(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$.\n*   **Connectivity of the Target Space $Y$:**\n    1.  The target space is $Y = \\Omega S^{10}$.\n    2.  This space is $(10-2) = 8$-connected.\n    3.  Its first non-trivial homotopy group is $\\pi_9(Y) = \\pi_{10}(S^{10}) = \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nBoth the source and target spaces are 8-connected, with their first non-trivial homotopy group at dimension 9, where both are isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the homotopy fiber of the map $\\phi$**\n\nThe connectivity of the map $\\phi$ is determined by the connectivity of its homotopy fiber, $F_\\phi$. A key result by G. W. Whitehead provides a fibration sequence involving this map:\n$\\Omega(\\Omega \\Sigma X * \\Omega \\Sigma Y) \\to \\Omega X * \\Omega Y \\stackrel{\\phi}{\\to} \\Omega(X \\wedge Y)$\n\nBy setting $X=S^4$ and $Y=S^6$, we can identify the fiber of our map $\\phi$:\n$F_\\phi \\simeq \\Omega(\\Omega \\Sigma S^4 * \\Omega \\Sigma S^6)$\n\nWe simplify the spaces inside the expression:\n*   $\\Omega \\Sigma S^4 \\simeq \\Omega S^5$.\n*   $\\Omega \\Sigma S^6 \\simeq \\Omega S^7$.\n\nSo, the fiber is $F_\\phi \\simeq \\Omega(\\Omega S^5 * \\Omega S^7)$.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the connectivity of the fiber $F_\\phi$**\n\n1.  Let $A' = \\Omega S^5$ and $B' = \\Omega S^7$.\n    *   $A'$ is $(5-2)=3$-connected.\n    *   $B'$ is $(7-2)=5$-connected.\n2.  Consider their join $A' * B' \\simeq \\Sigma(A' \\wedge B')$.\n    *   The smash product $A' \\wedge B'$ is $(3+5+1)=9$-connected.\n    *   The suspension (join) $\\Sigma(A' \\wedge B')$ is $(9+1)=10$-connected.\n3.  The fiber is the loop space of this join: $F_\\phi = \\Omega(A' * B')$. Looping a space decreases its connectivity by one.\n4.  Therefore, the fiber $F_\\phi$ is $(10-1)=9$-connected. This means $\\pi_i(F_\\phi) = 0$ for all $i \\le 9$.\n\n**Step 5: Relate fiber connectivity to map connectivity**\n\nThe long exact sequence of homotopy groups for the fibration $F_\\phi \\to X \\stackrel{\\phi}{\\to} Y$ is:\n$\\dots \\to \\pi_i(F_\\phi) \\to \\pi_i(X) \\stackrel{\\phi_*}{\\to} \\pi_i(Y) \\to \\pi_{i-1}(F_\\phi) \\to \\dots$\n\nSince $\\pi_i(F_\\phi) = 0$ for $i \\le 9$, the long exact sequence implies that the map $\\phi_*: \\pi_i(X) \\to \\pi_i(Y)$ is an isomorphism for $i \\le 9$ and a surjection for $i = 10$.\n\n**Step 6: State the connectivity of the map**\n\nThe connectivity of a map $f: X \\to Y$ is defined as the largest integer $k$ such that the induced map on homotopy groups, $f_*$, is an isomorphism for $i < k$ and a surjection for $i=k$.\n\n*   We found that $\\phi_*$ is an isomorphism for all $i \\le 9$. This means it is an isomorphism for all $i < 10$.\n*   We found that $\\phi_*$ is a surjection for $i=10$.\n\nBased on the definition, the connectivity of the map is 10. To be certain it is not 11-connected, we must verify that $\\phi_*$ is not an isomorphism for $i=10$. The LES segment at this dimension is $0 \\to \\pi_{10}(F_\\phi) \\to \\pi_{10}(X) \\stackrel{\\phi_*}{\\to} \\pi_{10}(Y) \\to 0$. Since $F_\\phi$ is 9-connected, its first non-trivial homotopy group is $\\pi_{10}(F_\\phi) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$, which is non-zero. This non-zero group is the kernel of $\\phi_*$ on $\\pi_{10}$. Therefore, $\\phi_*$ is not an isomorphism at $i=10$.\n\nThe connectivity of the map is exactly 10."
