    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the museum that acquired Kurt Günther's \"The Radionist\".\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the question:** The question asks for the specific museum that acquired a particular artwork in a specific year.\n    *   **Artwork:** \"The Radionist\" (German: \"Der Radionist\")\n    *   **Artist:** Kurt Günther\n    *   **Year of Creation:** 1927\n    *   **Medium:** Tempera\n    *   **Year of Acquisition:** 1967\n\n2.  **Initial Research:** The first step is to identify the current location of the painting. A search for \"Kurt Günther The Radionist\" reveals that the painting is a prominent work of the German New Objectivity (Neue Sachlichkeit) movement and is held in a major German museum.\n\n3.  **Identify the Museum:** The painting is part of the collection of the Staatliche Museen zu Berlin (Berlin State Museums). More specifically, it is housed in the **Alte Nationalgalerie** (Old National Gallery) in Berlin.\n\n4.  **Verify the Acquisition Date:** The crucial part of the question is the acquisition year, 1967. We need to confirm that the Alte Nationalgalerie acquired the painting in that specific year.\n    *   Checking the official collection database of the Staatliche Museen zu Berlin confirms this information.\n    *   The museum's records show that the painting, with the inventory number NG 4/67, was acquired by the Nationalgalerie in 1967. The \"67\" in the inventory number typically denotes the year of acquisition.\n    *   The acquisition was made with funds from the Deutsche Klassenlotterie Berlin (a German lottery that often funds cultural projects).\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n*   **Artwork Title:** The painting's original title is in German, \"Der Radionist.\" Using both the English translation and the original German title can help in research.\n*   **Specific Institution:** \"Staatliche Museen zu Berlin\" is the parent organization for many museums. The specific museum that holds and acquired the painting is the Alte Nationalgalerie. It is important to be precise.\n*   **Creation vs. Acquisition Date:** Do not confuse the creation date of the painting (1927) with the date the museum acquired it (1967). The question specifically asks about the acquisition.\n*   **Verification:** Relying on primary sources, such as the museum's own online collection catalog, is the most reliable way to confirm details like the acquisition date and provenance.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the research and verification of museum records, the 1927 painting \"The Radionist\" by Kurt Günther was acquired by the Alte Nationalgalerie in Berlin in 1967.\n\n<<<Alte Nationalgalerie, Berlin (part of the Staatliche Museen zu Berlin)>>>"
