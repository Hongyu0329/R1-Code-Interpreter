    "An involution in a group G is an element $g$ such that $g^2=1$ and $g \\neq 1$. We are looking for the number of involutions in the projective special unitary group $G = \\text{PSU}(4,997)$.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n**1. Relate Involutions in PSU(n,q) to Elements in SU(n,q)**\nLet $\\pi: \\text{SU}(n,q) \\to \\text{PSU}(n,q)$ be the natural projection. An element $\\bar{g} \\in \\text{PSU}(n,q)$ is an involution if $\\bar{g} \\neq \\bar{1}$ and $\\bar{g}^2 = \\bar{1}$.\nLet $g \\in \\text{SU}(n,q)$ be a preimage of $\\bar{g}$. The condition $\\bar{g}^2=\\bar{1}$ means $g^2 \\in Z(\\text{SU}(n,q))$, the center of $\\text{SU}(n,q)$. The condition $\\bar{g} \\neq \\bar{1}$ means $g \\notin Z(\\text{SU}(n,q))$.\nIn our case, $n=4$ and $q=997$. The center $Z = Z(\\text{SU}(4,q))$ consists of scalar matrices $\\lambda I$ such that $\\lambda^{\\gcd(n, q+1)}=1$.\nHere, $\\gcd(4, q+1) = \\gcd(4, 997+1) = \\gcd(4, 998) = 2$.\nSo, the center is $Z=\\{I, -I\\}$, which has size $|Z|=2$.\n\nThe preimages in SU(4,997) of involutions in PSU(4,997) are the elements $g \\in \\text{SU}(4,997)$ such that:\n(a) $g^2=I$ or $g^2=-I$.\n(b) $g \\neq I$ and $g \\neq -I$.\n\nLet $K$ be the set of these preimages. The set of involutions in PSU is $\\pi(K)$. The map $\\pi: K \\to \\pi(K)$ is a $|Z|=2$-to-1 map. Thus, the number of involutions in PSU(4,997) is $|K|/2$.\n\n**2. Classify and Count the Preimages**\nThe set $K$ can be partitioned into two disjoint sets:\n*   $K_1 = \\{ g \\in \\text{SU}(4,q) \\mid g^2=I, g \\notin Z \\}$.\n*   $K_2 = \\{ g \\in \\text{SU}(4,q) \\mid g^2=-I \\}$. Note that if $g^2=-I$, then $g$ cannot be in $Z=\\{I,-I\\}$, as this would imply $I=-I$, which is impossible since the characteristic of the field is not 2.\n\nThe total number of involutions is $\\frac{|K_1| + |K_2|}{2}$.\n\n**3. Counting $K_1$: Involutions in SU(4,q)**\nAn element $g \\in \\text{SU}(4,q)$ with $g^2=I$ is a semisimple matrix with eigenvalues $\\pm 1$. The condition $g \\in \\text{SU}(4,q)$ means its determinant must be 1. If $k$ is the dimension of the (-1)-eigenspace, then $\\det(g)=(-1)^k=1$, so $k$ must be even. For $n=4$, $k$ can be 0, 2, or 4.\n*   $k=0$: $g=I$. This element is in $Z$.\n*   $k=4$: $g=-I$. This element is in $Z$.\n*   $k=2$: These are the involutions whose (-1)-eigenspace is a 2-dimensional non-degenerate subspace. These are not in $Z$.\nThe number of such involutions, $|K_1|$, is equal to the number of non-degenerate 2-dimensional subspaces in a 4-dimensional unitary space over $\\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$. This number, denoted $N(4,2)$, is given by:\n$|K_1| = N(4,2) = \\frac{|U(4,q)|}{|U(2,q)||U(2,q)|} = \\frac{q^6(q+1)(q^2-1)(q^3+1)(q^4-1)}{(q(q+1)(q^2-1))^2} = q^4(q^2-q+1)(q^2+1)$.\n\n**4. Counting $K_2$: Square Roots of -I in SU(4,q)**\nAn element $g \\in \\text{SU}(4,q)$ with $g^2=-I$ has minimal polynomial dividing $x^2+1=0$.\nSince $q=997 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$, the equation $x^2=-1$ has two solutions in $\\mathbb{F}_q$. Let's call them $\\pm i$.\nThe eigenvalues of $g$ must be from $\\{i, -i\\}$. For $g$ to be unitary, the eigenspace for an eigenvalue $\\lambda$ must be totally isotropic if $\\lambda \\neq \\bar{\\lambda}^{-1} = \\lambda^{-q}$. Here $i \\in \\mathbb{F}_q$, so $i^q=i$. The condition for the eigenspace $V_i$ to be non-zero is that it is totally isotropic. The same holds for $V_{-i}$.\nThe unitary space $V$ decomposes into a direct sum of two 2-dimensional totally isotropic subspaces, $V = V_i \\oplus V_{-i}$. This forces $\\det(g)=i^2(-i)^2=1$.\nAll such elements $g$ form a single conjugacy class in SU(4,q). The size of this class is $|K_2|=|SU(4,q)|/|C_{SU(4,q)}(g)|$.\nThe centralizer $C_{U(4,q)}(g)$ is isomorphic to $\\text{GL}(2,q)$. Furthermore, any element in this centralizer has determinant 1, so $C_{SU(4,q)}(g) \\cong \\text{GL}(2,q)$.\nThe orders of the groups are:\n$|SU(4,q)| = q^6(q^2-1)(q^3+1)(q^4-1)$.\n$|GL(2,q)| = (q^2-1)(q^2-q) = q(q-1)(q^2-1)$.\n$|K_2| = \\frac{q^6(q^2-1)(q^3+1)(q^4-1)}{q(q-1)(q^2-1)} = \\frac{q^5(q+1)(q^2-1)(q^3+1)(q^2+1)}{q-1}$\n$= \\frac{q^5(q+1)(q-1)(q+1)(q+1)(q^2-q+1)(q^2+1)}{q-1} = q^5(q+1)^3(q^2-q+1)(q^2+1)$.\nThere seems to be a slight miscalculation in the thought process. Let's recompute $|K_2|$ from the factored forms:\n$|SU(4,q)| = q^6(q-1)^2(q+1)^3(q^2-q+1)(q^2+1)$.\n$|GL(2,q)| = q(q-1)^2(q+1)$.\n$|K_2| = \\frac{q^6(q-1)^2(q+1)^3(q^2-q+1)(q^2+1)}{q(q-1)^2(q+1)} = q^5(q+1)^2(q^2-q+1)(q^2+1)$.\n\n**5. Final Calculation**\nThe number of involutions is $\\frac{1}{2}(|K_1|+|K_2|)$.\nNumber = $\\frac{1}{2} [ q^4(q^2-q+1)(q^2+1) + q^5(q+1)^2(q^2-q+1)(q^2+1) ]$\n$= \\frac{1}{2} q^4(q^2-q+1)(q^2+1) [ 1 + q(q+1)^2 ]$\n$= \\frac{1}{2} q^4(q^2-q+1)(q^2+1) (1 + q(q^2+2q+1))$\n$= \\frac{1}{2} q^4(q^2-q+1)(q^2+1) (q^3+2q^2+q+1)$\nTo simplify, we can multiply the two latter polynomial factors:\n$(q^2-q+1)(q^3+2q^2+q+1) = q^5 + q^4 + 2q^2 + 1$.\nSo the number of involutions is given by the formula:\n$\\frac{1}{2} q^4(q^2+1)(q^5+q^4+2q^2+1)$.\n\nFor the specific case of PSU(4,997), we set $q=997$.\n\nThe final answer is the value of this formula for $q=997$.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   The center of SU(n,q) depends on $\\gcd(n,q+1)$.\n*   The classification of preimages depends on the solutions to $x^d=1$ where $d=|\\text{center}|$.\n*   The existence of square roots of $-1$ in the field $\\mathbb{F}_q$ depends on whether $q \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$ or $q \\equiv 3 \\pmod 4$. For $q=997$, $997=4 \\cdot 249 + 1$, so $q \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$.\n*   The number of elements of a given type is calculated by dividing the order of the group by the order of the centralizer of one such element.\n*   The number of involutions in PSU is not the sum of SU-class sizes, but half the sum of the number of preimages, which is equivalent to half the sum of PSU-class sizes. This subtlety arises because for the relevant elements $g$, $g$ is conjugate to $-g$ in SU.\n\nFinal Answer Formulation:\nThe question asks for the number, which is a specific value. The formula provides the means to calculate it.\nThe final answer is: $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 997^4 \\cdot (997^2+1) \\cdot (997^5+997^4+2 \\cdot 997^2+1)$."
