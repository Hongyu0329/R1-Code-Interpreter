    "This problem asks for the size of the smallest algebraic structure needed to color the figure-eight knot. This is a classic problem in knot theory, related to a concept called \"Fox n-coloring\".\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to arrive at the solution.\n\n### Step 1: Understand Knot Coloring\n\nKnot coloring is a way to assign a label (a \"color\") to each arc of a knot diagram. The colors are typically chosen from the set of integers modulo n, i.e., {0, 1, 2, ..., n-1}. For a coloring to be valid, it must follow specific rules:\n\n1.  **Rule 1 (Non-Triviality):** At least two different colors must be used in the coloring of the entire knot.\n2.  **Rule 2 (Crossing Rule):** At every crossing in the knot diagram, the colors of the three arcs that meet must satisfy a specific equation. If an arc with color `c` passes *over* two arcs with colors `a` and `b`, then the colors must satisfy the congruence:\n    `2c ≡ a + b (mod n)`\n\nA knot is said to be **n-colorable** if it's possible to find a valid, non-trivial coloring using `n` colors.\n\nThe algebraic structure mentioned in the question is the set of colors itself, which is `Z_n` (the integers modulo n), equipped with the operation related to the coloring rule. We are looking for the smallest integer `n > 1` for which the figure-eight knot is `n`-colorable.\n\n### Step 2: Set Up Equations for the Figure-Eight Knot\n\nThe figure-eight knot (also known as knot 4₁) has a standard diagram with 4 crossings and 4 arcs. Let's label the colors of the four arcs as `x₁`, `x₂`, `x₃`, and `x₄`.\n\nBased on a standard diagram of the figure-eight knot, we can establish a system of linear equations from the coloring rule at each crossing:\n\n*   **Crossing 1:** Arc `x₄` is over arcs `x₁` and `x₂`. Equation: `2x₄ ≡ x₁ + x₂ (mod n)`\n*   **Crossing 2:** Arc `x₂` is over arcs `x₁` and `x₃`. Equation: `2x₂ ≡ x₁ + x₃ (mod n)`\n*   **Crossing 3:** Arc `x₃` is over arcs `x₂` and `x₄`. Equation: `2x₃ ≡ x₂ + x₄ (mod n)`\n*   **Crossing 4:** Arc `x₁` is over arcs `x₃` and `x₄`. Equation: `2x₁ ≡ x₃ + x₄ (mod n)`\n\nRearranging these equations into a standard form (`Ax = 0`):\n\n1.  `x₁ + x₂ - 2x₄ ≡ 0 (mod n)`\n2.  `x₁ - 2x₂ + x₃ ≡ 0 (mod n)`\n3.  `x₂ - 2x₃ + x₄ ≡ 0 (mod n)`\n4.  `-2x₁ + x₃ + x₄ ≡ 0 (mod n)`\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Condition for Colorability\n\nWe are looking for non-trivial solutions to this system of homogeneous linear congruences. A non-trivial solution (where not all `xᵢ` are the same) exists if and only if the determinant of a related matrix is congruent to 0 modulo `n`.\n\nThe **determinant of a knot** is a key invariant used to determine its colorability. It is calculated by taking the coefficient matrix of the system of equations, removing any single row and any single column, and then finding the absolute value of the determinant of the resulting smaller matrix.\n\nThe `4x4` coefficient matrix `M` for our system is:\n```\nM = |  1   1   0  -2 |\n    |  1  -2   1   0 |\n    |  0   1  -2   1 |\n    | -2   0   1   1 |\n```\nTo find the knot determinant, we can remove the last row and last column to get a `3x3` matrix, let's call it `M'`:\n```\nM' = |  1   1   0 |\n     |  1  -2   1 |\n     |  0   1  -2 |\n```\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Knot Determinant\n\nNow, we calculate the determinant of `M'`:\n`det(M') = 1 * ((-2)(-2) - (1)(1)) - 1 * ((1)(-2) - (1)(0)) + 0`\n`det(M') = 1 * (4 - 1) - 1 * (-2 - 0)`\n`det(M') = 1 * (3) - 1 * (-2)`\n`det(M') = 3 + 2 = 5`\n\nThe determinant of the figure-eight knot is `|det(M')| = 5`.\n\n### Step 5: Determine the Smallest Number of Colors\n\nA fundamental theorem in knot theory states that a knot `K` is `n`-colorable if and only if `n` is a divisor of the determinant of the knot, `det(K)`.\n\nIn our case, `det(K) = 5`. The divisors of 5 are 1 and 5.\n*   `n=1`: This would mean using only one color, which is a trivial coloring. The non-triviality rule requires `n > 1`.\n*   `n=5`: This is the smallest integer greater than 1 that divides 5.\n\nTherefore, the smallest number of colors with which the figure-eight knot can be non-trivially colored is 5.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe \"smallest algebraic structure\" corresponds to the smallest set of colors, `Z_n`, for which a valid, non-trivial coloring exists. We found this to be `n=5`. The structure is `Z_5 = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}`, and the number of elements in this set is 5."
