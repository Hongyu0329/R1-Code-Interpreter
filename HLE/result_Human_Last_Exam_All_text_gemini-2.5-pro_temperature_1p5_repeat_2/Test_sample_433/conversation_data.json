    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Question:** The question asks for the Beyond-Use Date (BUD) for a specific type of container—a single-dose ampule—after it has been opened in a sterile environment.\n\n2.  **Define Key Terms:**\n    *   **Beyond-Use Date (BUD):** This is the date and/or time after which a compounded sterile preparation (CSP) or opened container should not be used. It is determined from the moment of compounding or opening/puncture and is based on the risk of microbial contamination. It is different from the manufacturer's expiration date, which applies to an unopened, intact product.\n    *   **Single-Dose Container (SDC):** A container intended for a single use in a single patient. It typically lacks antimicrobial preservatives. Examples include ampules, vials, and prefilled syringes.\n    *   **Ampule:** A hermetically sealed glass container. To access its contents, the glass neck must be broken. Once opened, an ampule cannot be resealed.\n    *   **Sterile Environment:** This refers to an ISO Class 5 or cleaner environment, such as a laminar airflow workbench (LAFW) or a biological safety cabinet (BSC), which is designed to minimize the risk of contamination during sterile compounding.\n\n3.  **Consult the Authoritative Guidelines:** The primary standard for sterile compounding in the United States is the **United States Pharmacopeia (USP) Chapter <797>**. These guidelines provide specific rules for assigning BUDs to sterile products.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Specifics of an Ampule:**\n    *   The defining characteristic of an ampule is that it is an **open system** once the neck is broken. Unlike a vial with a rubber stopper that can reseal after being punctured by a needle, an opened ampule is completely exposed to the surrounding air.\n    *   This direct and continuous exposure to the environment creates a high risk of microbial contamination.\n    *   The act of breaking the glass can also introduce microscopic glass particulates into the solution. A filter needle is required to withdraw the contents to remove these particulates, but the risk of microbial contamination from the open top remains.\n\n5.  **Apply the USP <797> Rule for Ampules:**\n    *   Due to the high risk associated with an open-system container, USP <797> has a very strict and specific rule for ampules.\n    *   The guideline states that an opened ampule must be **used immediately**.\n    *   Any unused portion of the medication in the ampule must be discarded and cannot be stored for any period, regardless of the environment it was opened in.\n\n6.  **Distinguish from Other Container Types (Careful Point):**\n    *   It is critical not to confuse an ampule with a **single-dose vial**.\n    *   Under current USP <797> guidelines, a single-dose *vial* (with a rubber stopper) punctured in a sterile (ISO Class 5) environment may be used for up to **12 hours**.\n    *   This longer BUD for vials is possible because the rubber stopper provides a protective barrier that is not present in an opened ampule. The question specifically asks about an ampule, so the 12-hour rule for vials does not apply.\n\n### Conclusion of Analysis\n\nThe BUD for a single-dose ampule is not a specified time duration (e.g., hours or days). Because it becomes an open system that cannot be resealed upon opening, the risk of contamination is too high to permit any storage. Therefore, the official guideline is that it must be used immediately, and any remainder must be discarded.\n\n***\n\nThe BUD for a single-dose ampule from the time of opening is **Immediate Use Only**. The ampule and any of its remaining contents must be discarded immediately after withdrawing the dose. There is no permissible storage time."
