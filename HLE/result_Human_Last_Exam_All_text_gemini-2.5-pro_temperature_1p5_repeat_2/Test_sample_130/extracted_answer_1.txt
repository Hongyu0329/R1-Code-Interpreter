The edges of the image will undergo a process akin to evolution by mean curvature. Initially, any sharp corners on the edges will be rounded off, making the edges smoother. Subsequently, any curved sections of the edges will tend to straighten out. If an edge forms a closed loop (i.e., it is the boundary of an isolated object), this object will continuously shrink in size with each iteration until it is completely eliminated from the image. The final state of the image as $t \rightarrow \infty$ will either be a single uniform color (black or white) or will be composed of large regions separated by perfectly straight-line edges.
