    "An elegant step-by-step analysis of the problem is as follows:\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the curve and its properties.**\n    The curve is given by the equation $C: y^2 = 8x^5 + 4x^4 + 4x^3 + x^2 + 8x$.\n    Let $f(x) = 8x^5 + 4x^4 + 4x^3 + x^2 + 8x$. The degree of the polynomial $f(x)$ is 5.\n    This is a hyperelliptic curve. The genus of a hyperelliptic curve $y^2 = f(x)$ is given by $g = \\lfloor(\\deg(f)-1)/2\\rfloor$.\n    In our case, $g = \\lfloor(5-1)/2\\rfloor = 2$.\n    The curve is defined over $\\mathbb{Q}$, and we are interested in its reduction properties over the 2-adic numbers, $\\mathbb{Q}_2$.\n\n2.  **Find a suitable integral model.**\n    The given equation has coefficients in $\\mathbb{Z}_2$, so it defines a model over $\\mathbb{Z}_2$. However, its reduction modulo 2 is $y^2 \\equiv x^2 \\pmod{2}$, which is a singular double line ($y=x$) over $\\mathbb{F}_2$. To understand the true nature of the reduction, we need to find a \"better\" model. This is achieved by an admissible change of variables. We seek a transformation $(x,y) \\to (x_1, y_1)$ that simplifies the reduction.\n    Let's try a scaling transformation of the form $x = 2^k x_1, y = 2^m y_1$ for integers $k,m$.\n    The equation becomes $(2^m y_1)^2 = f(2^k x_1)$, which simplifies to $y_1^2 = 2^{-2m}f(2^k x_1)$.\n    The goal is to find $k,m$ such that the new equation has integral coefficients and the most informative reduction. Let's try to make the coefficient of the $x^2$ term a unit (valuation 0).\n    The coefficient of $x^2$ in $f(x)$ is 1. The new coefficient of $x_1^2$ is $1 \\cdot (2^k)^2 \\cdot 2^{-2m} = 2^{2k-2m}$. For this to have valuation 0, we must have $2k-2m=0$, which implies $k=m$.\n    So we try transformations of the form $x=2^k x_1, y=2^k y_1$. The equation becomes:\n    $y_1^2 = 2^{-2k} f(2^k x_1) = 2^{-2k} [8(2^k x_1)^5 + 4(2^k x_1)^4 + 4(2^k x_1)^3 + (2^k x_1)^2 + 8(2^k x_1)]$\n    $y_1^2 = 2^{-2k} [2^{5k+3}x_1^5 + 2^{4k+2}x_1^4 + 2^{3k+2}x_1^3 + 2^{2k}x_1^2 + 2^{k+3}x_1]$\n    $y_1^2 = 2^{3k+3}x_1^5 + 2^{2k+2}x_1^4 + 2^{k+2}x_1^3 + x_1^2 + 2^{3-k}x_1$\n    For all coefficients to be in $\\mathbb{Z}_2$, all the exponents of 2 must be non-negative. This requires $3-k \\ge 0$, so $k \\le 3$. To get the \"best\" model, we typically choose the largest possible integer value for $k$. Let's choose $k=3$.\n\n3.  **Analyze the new model and its reduction.**\n    With $k=3$, the transformation is $x=8x_1, y=8y_1$. This is an isomorphism over $\\mathbb{Q}_2$. The new model, let's call it $C_1$, has the equation:\n    $y_1^2 = 2^{3(3)+3}x_1^5 + 2^{2(3)+2}x_1^4 + 2^{(3)+2}x_1^3 + x_1^2 + 2^{3-3}x_1$\n    $y_1^2 = 2^{12}x_1^5 + 2^8x_1^4 + 2^5x_1^3 + x_1^2 + x_1$\n    The coefficients are integers, so this is an integral model over $\\mathbb{Z}_2$. Now, let's reduce this equation modulo 2. Let $\\bar{C}_1$ be the resulting curve over $\\mathbb{F}_2$:\n    $\\bar{y_1}^2 \\equiv \\bar{x_1}^2 + \\bar{x_1} \\pmod{2}$\n\n4.  **Determine the properties of the reduced curve.**\n    The curve $\\bar{C}_1: y^2=x^2+x$ over $\\mathbb{F}_2$ is a conic. We can check if it is smooth. The partial derivative with respect to $y$ is $2y=0$. The partial derivative with respect to $x$ is $2x+1=1$. Since one partial derivative is never zero, the curve has no singular points and is smooth. A smooth conic over a field is isomorphic to the projective line $\\mathbb{P}^1$, so its genus is 0.\n\n5.  **Apply the theory of stable reduction.**\n    The fact that our genus 2 curve $C$ has a model $C_1$ that reduces to a smooth curve of genus 0 means that $C$ has **potentially good reduction**, and the potential genus is 0.\n    The stable reduction of a curve with potentially good reduction is a tree of projective lines. The arithmetic genus of such a configuration is 0.\n    Let $\\delta$ be the number of double points (nodes) in the stable reduction. Let $g$ be the genus of the original curve $C$ and let $g_s$ be the arithmetic genus of its stable reduction. There is a fundamental relationship known as the genus drop formula:\n    $g = g_s + \\delta$\n\n6.  **Calculate the number of double points.**\n    We have:\n    *   $g=2$ (the genus of the original curve $C$).\n    *   $g_s=0$ (the arithmetic genus of the stable reduction, which is a tree of $\\mathbb{P}^1$s).\n\n    Substituting these values into the formula:\n    $2 = 0 + \\delta$\n    This gives $\\delta = 2$.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   The transformation $x=8x_1, y=8y_1$ must be an isomorphism over $\\mathbb{Q}_2$ for the new curve to be equivalent to the old one. As $C$ is a smooth curve (its discriminant is non-zero), any birational transformation over $\\mathbb{Q}_2$ is an isomorphism. This one is.\n*   The reduction $y^2=x^2$ is highly singular and does not reveal the structure. Finding a better model is a critical step. The principle of choosing the scaling factor $k$ to make the lowest-order term's coefficient have valuation zero is a good heuristic.\n*   The genus of the reduced curve is not necessarily the same as the original curve. A drop in genus under reduction signals bad reduction.\n*   The formula $g=g_s+\\delta$ is key. It relates the geometric property of the original curve (its genus $g$) to the topological properties of its stable reduction (arithmetic genus $g_s$ and number of nodes $\\delta$).\n*   It is crucial to correctly identify that the stable reduction has genus 0. This follows from the model reducing to a smooth genus 0 curve.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{2}$.\n<<<2>>>"
