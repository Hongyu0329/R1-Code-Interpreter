    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the maximal rank of the complementary channel of a Pauli channel $\\Lambda$.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Define the Qudit Pauli Channel**\n    A quantum channel maps density matrices to density matrices. We are considering a qudit system, where the Hilbert space $\\mathcal{H}$ has dimension $d$. A Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ on this system is defined as:\n    $$ \\Lambda(\\rho) = \\sum_{k=0}^{d^2-1} p_k U_k \\rho U_k^\\dagger $$\n    -   $\\rho$ is a $d \\times d$ density matrix.\n    -   $\\{U_k\\}_{k=0}^{d^2-1}$ are the $d^2$ generalized Pauli operators (also known as Weyl-Heisenberg operators). They form a complete orthogonal basis for the space of $d \\times d$ matrices.\n    -   $\\{p_k\\}$ is a set of probabilities, meaning $p_k \\ge 0$ for all $k$ and $\\sum_{k=0}^{d^2-1} p_k = 1$.\n\n2.  **Define the Kraus Operators and Channel Rank**\n    The expression for $\\Lambda$ is already in the operator-sum or Kraus representation. A set of Kraus operators for $\\Lambda$ can be given by:\n    $$ A_k = \\sqrt{p_k} U_k $$\n    The rank of a quantum channel is defined as the rank of its Choi-JamioÅ‚kowski (CJ) matrix. This is also equal to the minimum number of Kraus operators needed to represent the channel. For the Pauli channel, the operators $\\{U_k\\}$ are linearly independent. Thus, the minimum number of Kraus operators is equal to the number of non-zero probabilities, $p_k$. Let this number be $N$. So, $\\text{rank}(\\Lambda) = N$.\n\n3.  **Define the Complementary Channel and its Rank**\n    Every quantum channel $\\Lambda$ has a complementary channel $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$. The complementary channel describes the information flow from the system to the environment. A key theorem in quantum information theory states that the rank of the complementary channel, $\\text{rank}(\\tilde{\\Lambda})$, is equal to the rank of the Gram matrix of the Kraus operators of the original channel $\\Lambda$.\n\n    Given a set of Kraus operators $\\{A_k\\}_{k=1}^N$ for $\\Lambda$, the Gram matrix $G$ is an $N \\times N$ matrix with entries:\n    $$ G_{ij} = \\text{Tr}(A_i^\\dagger A_j) $$\n    The theorem states:\n    $$ \\text{rank}(\\tilde{\\Lambda}) = \\text{rank}(G) $$\n\n4.  **Calculate the Gram Matrix for the Pauli Channel**\n    We use the Kraus operators $A_k = \\sqrt{p_k} U_k$ for the $N$ indices $k$ for which $p_k > 0$. The entries of the Gram matrix $G$ are:\n    $$ G_{kl} = \\text{Tr}(A_k^\\dagger A_l) = \\text{Tr}\\left((\\sqrt{p_k} U_k)^\\dagger (\\sqrt{p_l} U_l)\\right) = \\sqrt{p_k p_l} \\text{Tr}(U_k^\\dagger U_l) $$\n\n5.  **Use the Orthogonality of Pauli Operators**\n    A crucial property of the generalized Pauli operators is their orthogonality with respect to the Hilbert-Schmidt inner product:\n    $$ \\text{Tr}(U_k^\\dagger U_l) = d \\cdot \\delta_{kl} $$\n    where $\\delta_{kl}$ is the Kronecker delta (it is 1 if $k=l$ and 0 otherwise).\n\n6.  **Determine the Rank of the Gram Matrix**\n    Substituting the orthogonality relation into the expression for the Gram matrix elements, we get:\n    $$ G_{kl} = \\sqrt{p_k p_l} \\cdot (d \\cdot \\delta_{kl}) = d \\cdot p_k \\cdot \\delta_{kl} $$\n    This means the Gram matrix $G$ is a diagonal matrix. Its diagonal entries are the values $d \\cdot p_k$ for the $N$ indices where $p_k > 0$. Since we chose only the operators for which $p_k > 0$, all $N$ diagonal entries of $G$ are non-zero.\n    The rank of a diagonal matrix is the number of non-zero entries on its diagonal. Therefore:\n    $$ \\text{rank}(G) = N $$\n\n7.  **Find the Maximal Rank**\n    From the analysis above, we have found that $\\text{rank}(\\tilde{\\Lambda}) = N$, where $N$ is the number of non-zero probabilities $p_k$ in the definition of the Pauli channel.\n    The question asks for the *maximal* possible rank of the complementary channel. This corresponds to the maximum possible value for $N$. The total number of distinct generalized Pauli operators is $d^2$. We can define a valid Pauli channel where all $d^2$ probabilities are non-zero. For example, the completely depolarizing channel is a Pauli channel where $p_k = 1/d^2$ for all $k=0, 1, \\dots, d^2-1$. For this channel, $N = d^2$.\n    Since there are at most $d^2$ operators $U_k$, the number of non-zero probabilities $N$ cannot exceed $d^2$.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nThe rank of the complementary channel $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$ is equal to the number of non-zero probabilities $p_k$ in the definition of the Pauli channel $\\Lambda$. The maximum number of these probabilities is $d^2$. Therefore, the maximal rank of the complementary channel is $d^2$.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n*   The rank of a channel refers to the rank of its Choi matrix, which corresponds to the minimal number of required Kraus operators.\n*   The key to the solution is using the theorem that connects the rank of the complementary channel to the rank of the Gram matrix of the original channel's Kraus operators.\n*   The orthogonality of the generalized Pauli operators is a fundamental property that simplifies the Gram matrix to a diagonal form, making its rank easy to determine.\n*   The maximal rank is determined by the total number of operators in the basis that defines the channel type, which is $d^2$ for Pauli channels on a $d$-dimensional system.\n\n<<<d^2>>>"
