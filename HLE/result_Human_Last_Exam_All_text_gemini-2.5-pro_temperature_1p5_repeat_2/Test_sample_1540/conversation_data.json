    "This problem requires us to perform a case-insensitive lexicographical comparison of two strings of the same length and determine which is smaller or if they are equal. The key constraint is to devise a solution that is as memory-efficient as possible and to calculate the total memory in bytes used for its variables.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Core Task:** The fundamental operation is a lexicographical comparison. This means we compare the strings character by character from left to right. The first position where the characters differ determines the result. The comparison must be case-insensitive, meaning 'A' and 'a' should be treated as the same character.\n\n2.  **Identify the Memory Constraint:** The primary goal is to minimize the amount of memory used for variables. This pushes us to think beyond the most straightforward implementation and consider how we handle input and store data.\n\n3.  **Analyze Standard Approach (Two Buffers):**\n    *   A common way to solve this would be to read both strings into two separate character arrays.\n    *   Given the maximum string length is 100, we need buffers of size 101 to accommodate the characters plus the null terminator (`\\0`).\n    *   **Variables:**\n        *   `char string1[101];` // 101 bytes\n        *   `char string2[101];` // 101 bytes\n        *   A loop counter, say `int i;`. Assuming `int` is 4 bytes.\n    *   **Memory Usage:** 101 + 101 + 4 = 206 bytes. While simple, this approach may not be the *most* memory-efficient.\n\n4.  **Develop a More Memory-Efficient Approach (One Buffer):**\n    *   We can reduce memory usage by not storing the second string in a dedicated buffer. Instead, we can read it from the input stream one character at a time.\n    *   The strategy would be:\n        a. Read the first string completely into a buffer.\n        b. Read the second string character-by-character using a function like `getchar()`.\n        c. In a loop, compare the i-th character of the first string (from the buffer) with the i-th character of the second string (read directly from input).\n    *   This eliminates the need for the second 101-byte buffer.\n\n5.  **Calculate Memory for the Efficient Approach:**\n    Let's carefully list the variables needed for the one-buffer approach and choose the smallest possible data types.\n    *   **String Buffer:** We still need one buffer to hold the first string.\n        *   `char s1[101];` -> **101 bytes**\n    *   **Loop Index:** We need an index to access characters in `s1`. Since the string length is at most 100, the index will range from 0 to 99. The smallest standard integer type that can hold this range is `unsigned char` (0-255).\n        *   `unsigned char i;` -> **1 byte**\n    *   **Character from Input:** To read the second string character by character, we use `getchar()`. The C standard specifies that `getchar()` returns an `int`, not a `char`, so it can represent every possible character as well as the special `EOF` (End-Of-File) value. Therefore, we must use an `int` variable to store its return value.\n        *   `int c2;` -> **4 bytes** (assuming a common 32-bit system)\n\n6.  **Final Memory Calculation:**\n    The total memory (`m`) used for variables in the most memory-efficient solution is the sum of the sizes of the variables identified above.\n\n    m = (size of string buffer) + (size of loop index) + (size of `getchar()` variable)\n    m = 101 bytes + 1 byte + 4 bytes\n    m = 106 bytes\n\nThis approach is correct, functional, and minimizes memory usage by avoiding the allocation of a second large buffer. The total memory for its essential variables is 106 bytes.\n\n<<<106>>>"
