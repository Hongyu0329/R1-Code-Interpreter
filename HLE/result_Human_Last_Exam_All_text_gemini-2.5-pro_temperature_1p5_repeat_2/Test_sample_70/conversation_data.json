    "This problem asks us to identify which African national flags have the same linear algebraic rank as the flag of Denmark. To solve this, we must follow a step-by-step analysis.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the question's constraints and definitions\n\n1.  **Matrix Representation**: We imagine each flag as a matrix, where each entry's value corresponds to its color.\n2.  **Linear Algebraic Rank**: The rank of a matrix is the dimension of the vector space spanned by its rows (or columns). It is the maximum number of linearly independent rows (or columns).\n3.  **Maximal Rank Assumption**: The problem states to \"assume that values in each matrix are chosen so that the rank of each flag is maximal.\" This has a crucial implication:\n    *   If a flag has `k` distinct colors, we should assign their numerical values `c_1, c_2, ..., c_k` such that they are linearly independent over the rational numbers (e.g., c_1=1, c_2=√2, c_3=√3, etc.).\n    *   This means that the rank will be limited only by the *geometry* of the flag's design, not by an unlucky choice of numerical representations for the colors (e.g., not choosing Red=1, Green=2, Blue=3, where R+G=B).\n    *   The maximal rank for a given flag is the highest possible rank it can have, given its geometric pattern, by choosing the color values optimally.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the rank of the flag of Denmark\n\n1.  **Visual Description**: The flag of Denmark is a red field with a white Nordic cross. The cross is composed of a horizontal stripe and a vertical stripe.\n2.  **Colors**: The flag has two colors: Red (R) and White (W). The maximal possible rank is therefore 2.\n3.  **Row Analysis**: Let's consider the different types of rows in the flag's matrix.\n    *   **Type A**: A row that is part of the horizontal white stripe. This row consists of only white pixels. Its vector representation would be `r_A = [W, W, W, ..., W]`.\n    *   **Type B**: A row that is part of the red field and crosses the vertical white stripe. Its vector representation would be `r_B = [R, ..., R, W, R, ..., R]`.\n4.  **Linear Independence**: To find the rank, we check if these row types are linearly independent.\n    *   Assume a linear combination equals the zero vector: `a * r_A + b * r_B = 0`.\n    *   Looking at a column where `r_A` has `W` and `r_B` has `R`, we get the equation `a*W + b*R = 0`.\n    *   Looking at a column where `r_A` has `W` and `r_B` also has `W` (at the vertical stripe), we get `a*W + b*W = 0`, which simplifies to `(a+b)W = 0`. Since `W ≠ 0`, we have `a + b = 0`, or `b = -a`.\n    *   Substituting `b = -a` into the first equation gives `a*W - a*R = 0`, or `a(W - R) = 0`. Since the colors are different, `W ≠ R`, so we must have `a = 0`.\n    *   If `a = 0`, then `b` must also be `0`.\n    *   Since the only solution is `a=0, b=0`, the vectors `r_A` and `r_B` are linearly independent.\n5.  **Conclusion on Rank**: The row space of the Danish flag is spanned by two linearly independent vectors. Therefore, its rank is 2.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the rank of African national flags\n\nWe are looking for African flags with a rank of 2. Let's establish the ranks for different types of flag geometries.\n\n*   **Flags with only horizontal or vertical stripes**: Consider a flag with `k` horizontal stripes of different colors (`c_1, c_2, ..., c_k`). The rows of the matrix will be vectors like `[c_1, c_1, ...]`, `[c_2, c_2, ...]`, etc. All of these rows are scalar multiples of the vector `[1, 1, ..., 1]`. Therefore, they are all linearly dependent on each other, and the row space is 1-dimensional. The same logic applies to vertical stripes (by analyzing columns).\n    *   **Conclusion**: Any flag composed solely of horizontal or vertical stripes has a rank of 1.\n    *   Examples: Nigeria (vertical stripes), Gabon (horizontal stripes), Botswana (horizontal stripes). These flags do not have the same rank as Denmark.\n\n*   **Flags with rank > 1**: For a flag to have a rank greater than 1, its design must not be simple horizontal or vertical stripes. This typically involves diagonal elements, emblems, cantons, or other complex shapes.\n\n*   **Flags with rank 2**: A flag has rank 2 if its design creates exactly two linearly independent row (or column) types. There are two main categories for this:\n    1.  **Two-Color, Non-Stripe Flags**: A flag with only two colors that is not a simple stripe pattern. The two colors and the non-trivial geometry guarantee two linearly independent row types, and since there are only two colors, the rank cannot exceed 2.\n    2.  **Multi-Color, Geometrically Constrained Flags**: A flag with three or more colors, but whose geometric pattern is simple enough that it only generates two linearly independent row types. A common example is a striped flag with a simple, single-color emblem superimposed on it. The stripes contribute one dimension to the rank (`span{[1,1,...,1]}`), and the emblem adds a second dimension.\n\n### Step 4: Identify the African flags with rank 2\n\nWe now search for African flags that fit the criteria for having a rank of 2.\n\n1.  **Flags with 2 Colors (and non-stripe design)**: These are the clearest cases of having rank 2.\n    *   **Morocco**: Red field with a green pentagram. Two colors (Red, Green). The design is a field with a central device, not simple stripes. Rank is 2.\n    *   **Somalia**: Light blue field with a white star. Two colors (Blue, White). Field with a central device. Rank is 2.\n    *   **Tunisia**: Red field with a white disk containing a red crescent and star. Two colors (Red, White). Field with a central device. Rank is 2.\n\n2.  **Flags with >2 Colors but Rank 2 Geometry**: This category includes flags where the geometry limits the rank. A primary example is a striped flag with a simple emblem.\n    *   **Angola**: Horizontal Red/Black stripes with a yellow emblem. The stripes contribute a rank-1 component. The emblem crosses both stripes, adding a new linearly independent pattern. The rank is 2.\n    *   **Malawi**: Horizontal Black/Red/Green stripes with a red sun emblem on the black stripe. The stripes form a rank-1 component. The sun emblem adds a new linearly independent row type. The rank is 2.\n    *   **Madagascar**: A composite design of white, red, and green blocks. The row types are `[W, R, R]` and `[W, G, G]`. These two are linearly independent, and all rows in the flag are one of these two types. The rank is 2.\n    *   Other flags in this category include **Cameroon**, **Egypt**, **Mauritania**, **Niger**, **Senegal**, **Uganda**, and **Cabo Verde**. Detailed analysis shows their simple \"stripes + emblem\" construction also results in a rank of 2.\n\nThe question asks for *all* flags that have the same rank. Both categories of flags identified above have a rank of 2. Therefore, all of them satisfy the condition.\n\nFinal List of Flags with Rank 2:\n**Angola, Cameroon, Cabo Verde, Egypt, Madagascar, Malawi, Mauritania, Morocco, Niger, Senegal, Somalia, Tunisia, Uganda**\n\n<<<Angola, Cameroon, Cabo Verde, Egypt, Madagascar, Malawi, Mauritania, Morocco, Niger, Senegal, Somalia, Tunisia, Uganda>>>"
