    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the scansion for the Latin hexameter line: \"verum ubi equi atque hominis casu convenit imago.\"\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **The Text:** `verum ubi equi atque hominis casu convenit imago.`\n\n2.  **Basic Principles of Hexameter:**\n    *   A line has six feet.\n    *   Each foot is either a dactyl (`- u u`, one long syllable followed by two short) or a spondee (`- -`, two long syllables).\n    *   A syllable is long by nature if it contains a long vowel or diphthong.\n    *   A syllable is long by position if its vowel is followed by two or more consonants (or by x or z).\n    *   Elision: A final vowel (or `-m` ending) is usually dropped before a word beginning with a vowel or `h-`.\n    *   The fifth foot is almost always a dactyl.\n    *   The sixth foot is always treated as a spondee. The final syllable of the line is always long (*syllaba anceps*).\n\n3.  **Scanning from Right to Left (from the end of the line):** The end of a hexameter line is the most predictable.\n\n    *   **Feet 5 and 6:** We look for the pattern Dactyl-Spondee (`- u u | - -`). The words are `...convenit imago.`\n        *   `imago`: Syllabified `i-mā-gō`. The `i` is short, but the `ā` and `ō` are long.\n        *   `convenit`: This is the perfect tense, `convēnit`, so the `e` is long. The `i` is short.\n        *   Let's look at the syllable sequence for `...vēnit imāgō`: `vē-nit i-mā-gō`.\n        *   The sounds can be re-syllabified across word boundaries: `vē-ni-ti-mā-gō`.\n        *   `vē-`: Long by nature (`-`).\n        *   `-ni-`: The `i` from `convenit` is short (`u`).\n        *   `-ti-`: The `i` from `imago` is short (`u`).\n        *   `-mā-`: Long by nature (`-`).\n        *   `-gō`: Long by nature and position as the final syllable (`-`).\n        *   This sequence gives us `vēniti` (`- u u`), a perfect **Dactyl** for the fifth foot, and `māgō` (`- -`), a perfect **Spondee** for the sixth foot.\n\n4.  **Scanning from Left to Right (from the beginning of the line):**\n\n    *   **Foot 1:** `verum ubi...`\n        *   Elision occurs: `verum` ends in `-um` and `ubi` begins with a vowel `u`. The `-um` is elided, so we scan `ver'ubi`.\n        *   `vē-`: The `e` in `vērum` is naturally long (`-`).\n        *   `-ru-`: The `u` from `ubi` is short (`u`).\n        *   `-bi`: The `i` from `ubi` is short (`u`).\n        *   This gives `- u u`, a perfect **Dactyl** for the first foot.\n\n5.  **Analyzing the Middle (Feet 2, 3, and 4):**\n    *   We have now accounted for `verum ubi` (Foot 1) and `convenit imago` (Feet 5 and 6).\n    *   The middle of the line is `...equi atque hominis casu con...`\n    *   Let's identify the remaining feet working backward from Foot 5.\n    *   **Foot 4:** The syllable before `vēnit` is `con-` from `convenit`. This syllable is long by position (the `o` is followed by `n` and `v`). Before that is `-sū` from `casu`, which has a naturally long `ū`.\n        *   `sū con-` gives `- -`, a **Spondee**.\n    *   **Foot 3:** Before `-sū` is `cā-` from `casu` (long `ā`). Before that is `-nis` from `hominis`. The `i` in `-nis` is short, but it's followed by two consonants (`s` from `hominis` and `c` from `casu`), making the syllable long by position.\n        *   `-nis cā-` gives `- -`, a **Spondee**.\n    *   **Foot 2:** The remaining text is `...equi atque homi-`. This must form the second foot. Based on the pattern so far (D ? S S D S), the second foot must be a spondee. This part is notoriously difficult and requires metrical license.\n        *   Grammatically, `equi` is genitive singular `equī` (\"of a horse\").\n        *   There are two elisions: `equ(ī)` with `atque`, and `atqu(e)` with `hominis`.\n        *   The first syllable of the foot is `e-` from `equi`. This is naturally short. For the foot to be a spondee, this syllable must be treated as long, a license sometimes taken when the metrical stress (ictus) falls on a short syllable.\n        *   The second syllable is formed from `-qu(ī) at-`. The `a` in `atque` is followed by the consonant cluster `tq`, making it long by position.\n        *   So, by accepting the license of lengthening `e-` under ictus, the foot scans as `- -`, a **Spondee**.\n\n### **Final Result**\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the scansion of the line is:\n\n*   **Foot 1:** Dactyl (D)\n*   **Foot 2:** Spondee (S)\n*   **Foot 3:** Spondee (S)\n*   **Foot 4:** Spondee (S)\n*   **Foot 5:** Dactyl (D)\n*   **Foot 6:** Spondee (S)\n\nThe final pattern is D-S-S-S-D-S.\n\n<<<D S S S D S>>>"
