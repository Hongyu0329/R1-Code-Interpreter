    "**Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The core task is to find the tallest *historical* mountain mentioned in Homer's *Iliad*, with the specific exclusion of Mount Olympus.\n\n2.  **Identify Key Constraints:**\n    *   **Source Text:** The mountain must be mentioned in the *Iliad*.\n    *   **Type:** It must be a *historical* (i.e., real, geographical) mountain.\n    *   **Ranking:** It must be the tallest *after* Mount Olympus.\n\n3.  **List Mountains Mentioned in the *Iliad***: A careful reading and search of the text reveals several mountains that play a role, either as settings or as geographical markers for the origins of warriors.\n    *   **Mount Olympus:** The most famous, serving as the home of the gods. It is explicitly mentioned throughout the epic. It is the tallest mountain in Greece.\n    *   **Mount Ida (of the Troad):** A very important mountain near Troy. Zeus and other gods often observe the battle from its peaks (e.g., in Book 8 and Book 14). This is the modern Kaz Dağı in Turkey.\n    *   **Mount Samothrace (also called Saos):** In Book 13, the god Poseidon sits atop its peak to watch the Trojan War. This is the island of Samothrace, and its highest peak is Fengari.\n    *   **Mount Athos:** In Book 14, the goddess Hera flies over a series of mountains on her journey to deceive Zeus, explicitly landing on Mount Athos before heading to Lemnos. This is a real mountain and peninsula in northern Greece.\n    *   **Mount Pelion:** Mentioned several times, most famously as the source of the ash-wood for the spear of Achilles, which was a gift from the centaur Chiron to his father, Peleus. It is a real mountain in Thessaly, Greece.\n    *   **Mount Tmolus:** Mentioned in the Catalogue of Ships (Book 2) as the home of the Maeonian contingent who fought for Troy. It is a real mountain range in ancient Lydia, modern-day Turkey, now called Bozdağlar.\n    *   **Mount Parnassus:** Mentioned in the Catalogue of Ships (Book 2) as a landmark for the territory of the Phocians, who fought for the Achaeans. It is a real and very famous mountain in central Greece.\n\n4.  **Gather the Elevations of These Historical Mountains:** To determine the tallest, we need their modern geographical heights.\n    *   **Mount Olympus:** ~2,918 meters (9,573 ft)\n    *   **Mount Parnassus:** ~2,457 meters (8,061 ft)\n    *   **Mount Tmolus (Bozdağlar):** ~2,159 meters (7,083 ft)\n    *   **Mount Athos:** ~2,033 meters (6,670 ft)\n    *   **Mount Ida (Kaz Dağı):** ~1,774 meters (5,820 ft)\n    *   **Mount Pelion:** ~1,624 meters (5,328 ft)\n    *   **Mount Samothrace (Fengari):** ~1,611 meters (5,285 ft)\n\n5.  **Compare and Finalize the Answer:**\n    *   First, we exclude Mount Olympus as instructed by the question.\n    *   Next, we compare the elevations of the remaining mountains.\n    *   At 2,457 meters, Mount Parnassus is significantly taller than Mount Tmolus, Mount Athos, Mount Ida, Mount Pelion, and Mount Samothrace.\n    *   Therefore, after Mount Olympus, the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the *Iliad* is Mount Parnassus.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   It's crucial to distinguish between mountains mentioned in the *Iliad* specifically versus those mentioned in broader Greek mythology. All the mountains listed above have direct textual references in the *Iliad*.\n*   There are two famous \"Mount Idas\" in the Greek world. The one in the *Iliad* is the one near Troy (in modern Turkey), not the taller one on Crete associated with the birth of Zeus.\n*   The mentions can be brief (like Parnassus in the Catalogue of Ships) or central to the plot (like Ida). The prominence of the mention does not affect the answer, only that it is mentioned at all.\n\n<<<Mount Parnassus>>>"
