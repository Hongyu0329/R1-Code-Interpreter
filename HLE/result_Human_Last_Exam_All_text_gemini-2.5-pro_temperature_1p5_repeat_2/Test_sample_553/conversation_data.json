    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct song.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Musical Terminology in the Question\n\n*   **\"The Beatles\"**: The artist in question. The search is limited to their official catalog.\n*   **\"Starts with\"**: The musical event must happen at the very beginning of the song, as part of the introduction or the first line of the verse.\n*   **\"Tonic\"**: This is the \"home\" chord of the song's key, also known as the 'I' chord (if major) or the 'i' chord (if minor). It provides the sense of resolution.\n*   **\"Minor fifth chord\"**: This is a minor chord built on the fifth note of the scale. In a minor key, this is the naturally occurring 'v' chord. For example, in the key of A minor, the tonic is A minor (i), and the minor fifth is E minor (v). In a major key, this would be a \"borrowed\" chord. For example, in C major, the tonic is C major (I), and the minor fifth would be G minor (v), which is not naturally in the key.\n*   **\"Chord jump\"**: This suggests a direct and prominent transition from the tonic to the minor fifth chord.\n\n### Step 2: Formulate the Chord Progression to Look For\n\nBased on the analysis, we are looking for a Beatles song that opens with the progression **i -> v** (a minor tonic chord followed by a minor fifth chord). The less common I -> v (major tonic to minor fifth) is also a possibility but less likely to be the intended answer for such a well-known catalog.\n\n### Step 3: Scan Famous Beatles Songs for This Progression\n\nLet's examine some candidates:\n\n*   **\"A Hard Day's Night\"**: Starts with a famous, complex dissonant chord. Does not fit.\n*   **\"Eleanor Rigby\"**: Starts on an Em chord, which is the iii chord in the implied key of C major. This is not a jump *from* the tonic.\n*   **\"Things We Said Today\"**: This song is in the key of A minor. The tonic ('i') chord is A minor (Am). The fifth note of the A minor scale is E, and the minor fifth ('v') chord is E minor (Em). The song opens with a strummed Am chord, and the very first line of the verse (\"You say you will love me...\") moves directly from Am to Em. This is a perfect match for the **i -> v** progression.\n*   **\"Michelle\"**: This song is famously in the key of F minor for its verses. The tonic ('i') chord is F minor (Fm). The fifth note of the F minor scale is C, and the minor fifth ('v') chord is C minor (Cm). The song opens with an instrumental guitar line establishing the Fm tonic. Then, the first vocal phrase \"Mi-chelle, ma belle\" starts on the Fm chord and \"jumps\" to the Cm chord. This is also a perfect match for the **i -> v** progression.\n\n### Step 4: Compare the Candidates and Select the Definitive Answer\n\nBoth \"Things We Said Today\" and \"Michelle\" fit the technical description perfectly. However, we must consider which song is more defined by this specific \"jump.\"\n\n*   The opening of **\"Michelle\"** is one of the most recognizable in the Beatles' catalog. Its unique, somewhat continental European flavor is created precisely by this harmonic movement from F minor to C minor, which is central to the song's identity. The progression is sophisticated and is a hallmark of Paul McCartney's songwriting from that era.\n*   In **\"Things We Said Today,\"** the Am -> Em progression is a more standard and common folk/rock progression for a minor key verse. While it fits the criteria, it's less of a unique \"jump\" and more of a standard harmonic pattern. The most notable harmonic feature of this song is actually the dramatic shift to A major for the middle section.\n\nGiven that the progression in \"Michelle\" is more distinctive, iconic, and central to the song's character from the very first notes, it is the stronger and more likely intended answer.\n\n<<<Michelle>>>"
