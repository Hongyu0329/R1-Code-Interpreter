    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core of the question.**\nThe question asks for the total number of times Anton Chekhov describes the police superintendent Otchumyelov's coat or the act of him manipulating it (putting it on, taking it off, etc.) in the short story \"The Chameleon.\" The question correctly notes that these descriptions are symbolic of his changing mentality and attitude.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the character and the symbolic object.**\nThe character is Otchumyelov. The symbolic object is his overcoat (sometimes translated as \"greatcoat\"). His actions with the coat—putting it on when he feels intimidated or cold with fear, and taking it off when he feels authoritative and \"hot\" with power—are central to the story's theme.\n\n**Step 3: Chronologically list and count each instance from the story.**\nWe need to scan the text of \"The Chameleon\" and find every moment the coat is mentioned in a descriptive or active way.\n\n1.  **First Instance (Initial State):** At the very beginning of the story, Chekhov introduces the character: \"Police Superintendent Otchumyelov crosses the market square in a new overcoat...\" This is the first description, establishing his initial appearance.\n2.  **Second Instance (First Shift):** The first major shift occurs when someone in the crowd suggests the dog belongs to the important General Zhigalov. Otchumyelov immediately feels a metaphorical \"chill\" of fear. He tells his subordinate, \"Help me on with my overcoat, Yeldyrin, my lad.... There's a wind getting up.... I am shivering.\" He puts the coat on to shield himself.\n3.  **Third Instance (Second Shift):** The policeman Yeldyrin reasons that it cannot be the General's dog. Otchumyelov's authority returns, and he feels \"hot.\" He commands, \"Take off my coat, Yeldyrin...\" He removes the coat, symbolizing his renewed confidence.\n4.  **Fourth Instance (Third Shift):** The victim, Hryukin, speculates that the dog might be the General's after all. The fear returns instantly. Otchumyelov once again says, \"Help me on with my coat, Yeldyrin, my lad.... I feel a cold breath of wind.\" He puts the coat back on.\n5.  **Fifth Instance (Fourth Shift):** The General's cook, Prokhor, arrives and confirms the dog is not the General's. Otchumyelov, feeling powerful and exposed, says, \"Take my coat off...\" He takes it off for a second time.\n6.  **Sixth Instance (Final Shift):** The final twist comes when Prokhor clarifies that the dog actually belongs to the General's visiting brother. This is still a connection to power. In response, Otchumyelov doesn't just put the coat on; he \"wraps his greatcoat about him\" and smiles sentimentally, settling into his final, obsequious posture before marching off.\n\n**Step 4: Tally the results and conclude.**\nBy counting each distinct instance where the coat is described or its state is actively changed, we find there are six such moments in the story. Each of these moments is a deliberate choice by Chekhov to visually represent Otchumyelov's \"chameleon-like\" changes in attitude based on his perception of power and social status.\n\nThe careful points to note are:\n*   The count includes the initial description, which sets the scene.\n*   It includes every time Otchumyelov gives an order to put the coat on or take it off.\n*   It includes the final, distinct action of \"wrapping\" the coat, which represents his final subservient state.\n*   The actions directly correspond to his mental shifts from authoritative to fearful and back again.\n\nTotaling these instances gives us the final count.\n\n<<<6>>>"
