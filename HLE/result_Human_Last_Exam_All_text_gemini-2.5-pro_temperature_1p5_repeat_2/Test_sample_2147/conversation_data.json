    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the identity of \"X-Y\".\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe core of the question is to identify the term \"X-Y\" which Pavel Milyukov, a prominent Russian political figure, famously denounced as a 'stagnant swamp' as part of his criticism of contemporary culture, which he associated with the West.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Pavel Milyukov and his Cultural Stance**\nPavel Milyukov (1859-1943) was a leader of the liberal Constitutional Democratic Party (Kadets) in late Imperial Russia, a historian, and a public intellectual. While a political liberal and \"Westernizer\" in many respects, he held conservative and traditionalist views when it came to the arts. He championed 19th-century Realism and was highly critical of the modernist and avant-garde movements that were emerging in the early 20th century.\n\n**Step 3: Search for the Specific Quote**\nThe phrase 'stagnant swamp' (застойное болото, *zastoynoye boloto*) is a well-known quote attributed to Milyukov. Historical sources place this comment at the **First All-Russian Congress of Artists**, which took place in St. Petersburg in December 1911 and January 1912. Milyukov gave a speech in which he attacked the new, radical art movements.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Target of the Criticism**\nIn his speech, Milyukov's criticism was aimed squarely at the Russian avant-garde. The most prominent and provocative of these groups at the time was the **\"Jack of Diamonds\"** (Бубновый валет, *Bubnovy Valet*). This group, which included artists like Mikhail Larionov, Natalia Goncharova, and Pyotr Konchalovsky, was heavily influenced by Western European Post-Impressionism, Fauvism, and early Cubism (styles associated with Cézanne, Matisse, etc.). Their work was a radical break from the academic and realist traditions Milyukov admired.\n\n**Step 5: Connect the Target to \"X-Y\" and \"Western Culture\"**\n*   The term **\"Jack of Diamonds\"** perfectly fits the \"X-Y\" structure.\n*   Milyukov's denunciation of the \"Jack of Diamonds\" group was part of his broader argument against what he saw as the decadent, chaotic, and irrational influence of modern Western European culture on Russia. He saw their art not as a genuine Russian development but as a poor imitation of foreign fads. Thus, by attacking them, he was attacking the contemporary Western culture he despised.\n\n**Conclusion**\nBased on the historical context of the quote, Pavel Milyukov was referring to the artists and artworks of the \"Jack of Diamonds\" group when he used the phrase 'stagnant swamp'.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Context is Crucial:** Milyukov's attack was not just an aesthetic opinion but also a political and cultural statement. He represented the established, liberal-bourgeois intellectual order, which was being challenged by the radicalism of the artistic avant-garde.\n2.  **The Name \"Jack of Diamonds\":** The group's name was intentionally provocative. In Tsarist Russia, a diamond shape was sewn onto the clothing of convicts, and the \"Jack\" in card-playing slang could mean a knave or scoundrel. The artists embraced this association with low-brow culture and criminality to shock the establishment, making them an easy target for Milyukov.\n3.  **The \"West\" Connection:** While the \"Jack of Diamonds\" was a Russian group, their artistic inspiration was undeniably Western European, particularly from Paris. For a critic like Milyukov, this foreign influence was a key part of the problem.\n4.  **The Event:** The quote is tied to a specific, significant event—the First All-Russian Congress of Artists. This makes its attribution and target very precise.\n\n<<<Jack of Diamonds>>>"
