    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core problem.**\nThe question asks for the minimum length of a symmetric key to be secure against a theoretical, powerful quantum computer. This means we need to consider how a quantum computer would attack a symmetric cipher.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the attack methods.**\n*   **Classical Computer Attack:** The primary attack against a symmetric key on a classical computer is a brute-force search. For a key of length 'n' bits, there are 2^n possible keys. A classical computer would need, on average, 2^(n-1) attempts to find the correct key. The security level is therefore said to be 'n' bits. For a 128-bit key, this is 2^128 operations, which is considered computationally infeasible.\n*   **Quantum Computer Attack:** For symmetric ciphers, the most effective known quantum attack is based on **Grover's algorithm**. Grover's algorithm is a quantum search algorithm that can find a specific item in an unstructured list of N items in roughly √N (square root of N) steps.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the impact of the quantum attack.**\n*   The set of all possible keys for a symmetric cipher of length 'n' is an unstructured list of size N = 2^n.\n*   A classical computer search takes O(N) = O(2^n) time.\n*   Grover's algorithm on a quantum computer can search this space in O(√N) = O(√(2^n)) = O(2^(n/2)) time.\n*   This means that Grover's algorithm effectively halves the security strength of the key in terms of bits. A key of length 'n' provides n-bit security against a classical computer, but only (n/2)-bit security against a quantum computer.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the target security level.**\n*   The current industry standard for strong security is 128-bit security. This means an attacker would need to perform a workload equivalent to 2^128 classical computations, which is considered secure for the foreseeable future.\n*   To be considered \"quantum-resistant\" or \"post-quantum secure,\" a system must provide at least this same level of security (128-bit) against a quantum adversary.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the required key length.**\n*   Let 'n' be the required symmetric key length.\n*   The security level against a quantum computer is n/2 bits.\n*   We want this security level to be at least 128 bits.\n*   So, we set up the inequality: `n / 2 ≥ 128`\n*   Solving for 'n': `n ≥ 256`\n\n**Step 6: Evaluate the options.**\n*   **A. 256:** A 256-bit key provides 256 / 2 = 128 bits of security against a quantum computer. This meets our target of 128-bit security.\n*   **B. 128:** A 128-bit key provides 128 / 2 = 64 bits of security against a quantum computer. A search of 2^64 is considered feasible and is not secure.\n*   **C. 512:** A 512-bit key provides 512 / 2 = 256 bits of security. While this is secure, the question asks for the *minimum* length (\"at least\"). 256 bits is the minimum required to achieve the 128-bit security level.\n*   **D. 1024:** Provides 512 bits of security. More than the minimum.\n*   **E. 2048:** Provides 1024 bits of security. More than the minimum.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nTo maintain a 128-bit security level against an attack using Grover's algorithm, the symmetric key length must be at least 256 bits. This is why cryptographic standards bodies like NIST recommend using AES-256 for long-term security in a post-quantum world.\n\n<<<A>>>"
