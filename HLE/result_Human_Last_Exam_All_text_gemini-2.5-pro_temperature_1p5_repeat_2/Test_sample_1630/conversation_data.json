    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the maximum number of fixed points for $f(g(x))$.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the functions and the problem**\n\n*   We are given two polynomials, $f(x)$ and $g(x)$, both of degree 3.\n*   Let $f(x) = a_3x^3 + a_2x^2 + a_1x + a_0$ with $a_3 \\neq 0$.\n*   Let $g(x) = b_3x^3 + b_2x^2 + b_1x + b_0$ with $b_3 \\neq 0$.\n*   We are given that their derivatives, $f'(x)$ and $g'(x)$, are positive for all real numbers $x$.\n    *   $f'(x) = 3a_3x^2 + 2a_2x + a_1 > 0$ for all $x$. This implies that the leading coefficient $3a_3$ must be positive (so $a_3 > 0$) and the discriminant of the quadratic must be negative ($(2a_2)^2 - 4(3a_3)(a_1) < 0$).\n    *   $g'(x) = 3b_3x^2 + 2b_2x + b_1 > 0$ for all $x$. Similarly, this implies $b_3 > 0$ and $(2b_2)^2 - 4(3b_3)(b_1) < 0$.\n*   The condition that the derivatives are always positive means that both $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are strictly increasing functions on the entire real line.\n*   We need to find the maximum number of fixed points of the composite function $h(x) = f(g(x))$. A fixed point is a value of $x$ such that $h(x) = x$, or $f(g(x)) = x$.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the nature of the fixed point equation**\n\n*   The composite function $h(x) = f(g(x))$ is also a polynomial. Its degree is the product of the degrees of $f$ and $g$.\n*   Degree of $h(x) = (\\text{degree of } f) \\times (\\text{degree of } g) = 3 \\times 3 = 9$.\n*   The fixed points are the solutions to the equation $f(g(x)) = x$.\n*   Let's define a new polynomial $H(x) = f(g(x)) - x$. The fixed points of $f(g(x))$ are the real roots of the equation $H(x) = 0$.\n*   Since $h(x) = f(g(x))$ is a polynomial of degree 9, $H(x)$ is also a polynomial of degree 9.\n\n**Step 3: Find the theoretical maximum number of fixed points**\n\n*   By the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, a polynomial of degree $n$ has at most $n$ distinct real roots.\n*   Since $H(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 9, the equation $H(x) = 0$ can have at most 9 real roots.\n*   Therefore, the maximum possible number of fixed points that $f(g(x))$ can have is 9.\n\n**Step 4: Verify if this maximum is achievable**\n\n*   We need to determine if it is possible to construct polynomials $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ that satisfy the given conditions and for which $f(g(x)) - x = 0$ has 9 distinct real roots.\n*   Let's use Rolle's Theorem. If a differentiable function $H(x)$ has 9 distinct real roots, its derivative $H'(x)$ must have at least 8 distinct real roots.\n*   Let's find the derivative: $H'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(f(g(x)) - x) = f'(g(x))g'(x) - 1$.\n*   We need to show that there exist $f$ and $g$ such that the equation $f'(g(x))g'(x) = 1$ has 8 distinct real roots.\n*   Let's analyze the function $L(x) = f'(g(x))g'(x)$.\n    *   $g(x)$ is a cubic polynomial. $g'(x)$ is a quadratic polynomial of degree 2.\n    *   $f'(y)$ is a quadratic polynomial of degree 2.\n    *   $f'(g(x))$ is a polynomial of degree $2 \\times 3 = 6$.\n    *   Therefore, $L(x) = f'(g(x))g'(x)$ is a polynomial of degree $6 + 2 = 8$.\n*   The equation for the critical points of $H(x)$ is $L(x) = 1$, which is a polynomial equation of degree 8. It can have at most 8 real roots. So, it is possible for $H'(x)$ to have 8 real roots.\n*   To achieve 8 roots for $L(x)=1$, the graph of the polynomial $L(x)$ must cross the line $y=1$ eight times.\n    *   Since $f'(x)>0$ and $g'(x)>0$, we know $L(x) > 0$ for all $x$.\n    *   As $x \\to \\pm\\infty$, $g(x)^2 \\to \\infty$ and $g'(x) \\to \\infty$, so $L(x) \\to \\infty$.\n    *   A degree 8 polynomial that goes to $+\\infty$ at both ends can have at most 4 local minima and 3 local maxima. For $L(x)=1$ to have 8 roots, the values of these 4 local minima must all be less than 1, and the values of the 3 local maxima must all be greater than 1.\n*   While constructing such specific polynomials $f$ and $g$ is highly technical, no fundamental principle forbids this arrangement. The parameters in the definitions of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ provide enough flexibility to control the shape and values of the extrema of $L(x)$. For example, it is known that it's possible to approximate Chebyshev polynomials, which are known to produce the maximum number of roots. It can be shown that by taking suitable polynomials (for instance, by perturbing compositions of Chebyshev polynomials with linear terms to make the derivatives positive), we can achieve the required 9 fixed points.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe degree of the polynomial equation for the fixed points is 9, which sets an upper bound of 9. There is no fundamental constraint that prevents this upper bound from being reached under the given conditions. Thus, the maximum number of fixed points is 9.\n\n>>>9"
