    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the user's query into key components.**\nThe question asks for a specific film based on several distinct criteria:\n*   **Film Type:** Hollywood feature film.\n*   **Producer:** A major film studio.\n*   **Character:** A teenager.\n*   **Key Object:** A pink bike.\n*   **Key Action:** The teenager pedals the bike directly toward an oncoming car.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze each component to narrow down the search.**\n*   **\"Hollywood feature film\" and \"major film studio\"** means we are looking for a well-known, theatrically released American movie, not an indie film, foreign film, or TV show. Studios like Warner Bros., Universal, Paramount, Sony, Disney, or their major subsidiaries (like New Line Cinema) would qualify.\n*   **\"Teenager\"** specifies the age of the protagonist in the scene.\n*   **\"Pink bike\"** is a very specific visual cue. This eliminates movies where bikes are present but are not pink (e.g., the BMX bikes in `E.T.`, the red cruiser in `Pee-wee's Big Adventure`).\n*   **\"Pedals directly toward an oncoming car\"** describes a specific, confrontational, and dangerous action. This is the central event of the scene we need to identify. It's not just riding near a car, but a head-on course.\n\n**Step 3: Brainstorm potential films and evaluate them against the criteria.**\n*   A common association with \"pink\" and \"teenager\" is the film `Pretty in Pink` (1986). However, the main character, Andie, drives a pink car (a Karmann Ghia), not a pink bike. This film is incorrect.\n*   Other teen movies featuring bikes, like `The Goonies` (1985) or `Now and Then` (1995), do not feature a pink bike being ridden toward a car.\n*   The combination of kids on bikes and danger often brings Stephen King adaptations to mind. Let's consider the most prominent one featuring a group of teens on bikes: `It`.\n\n**Step 4: Focus on the film `It` (2017).**\n*   **Film Type & Producer:** `It` (also known as `It Chapter One`) is a major Hollywood feature film produced by New Line Cinema, a subsidiary of Warner Bros. This fits the criteria.\n*   **Character:** The scene in question involves the \"Losers' Club,\" a group of young teenagers. Specifically, the character Beverly Marsh (played by Sophia Lillis) is the one on the bike. She is a teenager. This fits the criteria.\n*   **Key Object:** Beverly Marsh's bicycle is memorably and distinctly pink. This fits the criteria.\n*   **Key Action:** There is a pivotal scene, the \"rock war,\" where the Losers' Club confronts the bully Henry Bowers and his gang. To create a diversion and show her fearlessness, Beverly pedals her pink bike directly at Bowers' oncoming Trans Am, forcing him to swerve at the last moment to avoid hitting her. This action perfectly matches the description \"pedal directly toward an oncoming car.\"\n\n**Step 5: Conclude based on the evidence.**\nThe 2017 film `It` meets every specific requirement laid out in the question. The scene is a memorable character moment for Beverly Marsh and a key part of the plot.\n\n<<<It (2017)>>>"
