    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the question:**\n    *   **System:** We have two distinct materials, let's call them System A and System B.\n    *   **Material Properties:** Both System A and System B are Chern insulators. A Chern insulator is a 2D topological phase of matter characterized by a non-zero integer topological invariant called the Chern number ($C$). They are insulators in the bulk but have metallic, chiral edge states.\n    *   **Chern Number:** Both System A and System B have a Chern number of $C_A = 1$ and $C_B = 1$.\n    *   **Configuration:** They are connected \"laterally\", meaning they are placed side-by-side, sharing a common boundary.\n    *   **Interface:** The tunneling barrier between them is \"negligible\". This is a critical condition meaning the interface is transparent, and the two systems effectively merge into a single, larger system.\n    *   **Objective:** We need to find the \"Chern number of this junction\". This phrasing is best interpreted as asking for the effective Chern number of the combined system.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Chern Number as a Topological Invariant:** The Chern number is a robust property of the material's bulk electronic band structure. It can only change if the bulk energy gap closes and reopens, which is a topological phase transition.\n2.  **Additivity of Chern Number:** For non-interacting or weakly coupled systems that are combined, the Chern number of the composite system is the sum of the Chern numbers of its parts. The condition of a \"negligible tunneling barrier\" ensures that the two systems can be treated as a single, combined entity without significant perturbations that would close the bulk gap.\n3.  **Bulk-Boundary Correspondence:** This is a fundamental principle connecting the bulk topological invariant (Chern number) to the properties of the system's boundary. The number of chiral edge states at an interface between two regions with Chern numbers $C_1$ and $C_2$ is given by the difference $|C_1 - C_2|$. A chiral edge state is a one-way channel for charge carriers.\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer with Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nWe can determine the Chern number of the combined system in two ways.\n\n**Method 1: Using the Additivity Principle**\n\n*   We start with two systems, A and B.\n*   Chern number of System A: $C_A = 1$.\n*   Chern number of System B: $C_B = 1$.\n*   Since the systems are joined with a negligible barrier, they form a new, larger system. The total Chern number of this composite system is the sum of the individual Chern numbers.\n*   $C_{total} = C_A + C_B$\n*   $C_{total} = 1 + 1 = 2$\n*   Therefore, the combined system behaves as a single Chern insulator with a Chern number of 2.\n\n**Method 2: Using the Bulk-Boundary Correspondence**\n\nLet's analyze the edge states of the composite structure. Imagine the two Chern insulators are stacked, bounded by a vacuum ($C_{vac} = 0$) on the top and bottom.\n\n*   **Top Boundary:** The interface is between System A ($C_A = 1$) and the vacuum ($C_{vac} = 0$). The number of edge states is $|C_A - C_{vac}| = |1 - 0| = 1$.\n*   **Bottom Boundary:** The interface is between System B ($C_B = 1$) and the vacuum ($C_{vac} = 0$). The number of edge states is $|C_B - C_{vac}| = |1 - 0| = 1$.\n*   **Internal Junction:** The interface is between System A ($C_A = 1$) and System B ($C_B = 1$). The number of edge states at this junction is $|C_A - C_B| = |1 - 1| = 0$.\n\n**Conclusion from edge states:**\nThe internal junction between the two identical Chern insulators has no net edge states; it effectively becomes part of the bulk of the new composite material. The entire system, when viewed from the outside, has a total of $1 + 1 = 2$ chiral edge states on its external boundaries. According to the bulk-boundary correspondence, a system with $|C|$ chiral edge states must have a bulk Chern number of $C$. Thus, the effective Chern number of the combined system is 2.\n\nBoth methods consistently show that the junction of two Chern insulators with $C=1$ results in a single system with a Chern number of 2.\n\n<<<2>>>"
