    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the shape of the water surface.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the Object and its Orientation:**\n    *   The tank has the shape of a **regular icosahedron**. A regular icosahedron is a Platonic solid with 20 identical faces, each being an equilateral triangle. It also has 30 edges and 12 vertices.\n    *   The tank is \"standing on one of its faces.\" This means one of the 20 triangular faces is horizontal and serves as the base.\n\n2.  **Use Symmetry to Understand the Orientation:**\n    *   A key property of a regular icosahedron is that it has a **center of symmetry**. This means for every point on the icosahedron, there is a corresponding point directly opposite it through the center.\n    *   Because of this symmetry, if one face is horizontal at the bottom, its opposite face must be horizontal at the top, parallel to the base.\n    *   The vertical axis passing through the centers of these top and bottom faces is an axis of **3-fold rotational symmetry**. Rotating the icosahedron by 120Â° around this axis leaves it looking unchanged.\n\n3.  **Interpret the \"Half-Filled\" Condition:**\n    *   The tank is \"half-filled with water,\" which means the volume of the water is exactly half the total volume of the icosahedron.\n    *   For any centrally symmetric object, a plane passing through its center of symmetry will divide the object into two identical halves of equal volume.\n    *   Therefore, the water surface must be a **horizontal plane passing through the exact geometric center** of the icosahedron.\n\n4.  **Define the Geometrical Problem:**\n    *   The question, \"what is the shape of the water surface?\" is equivalent to asking, \"what is the shape of the horizontal cross-section of the icosahedron at its center, when it's oriented with a face at the bottom?\"\n\n5.  **Determine the Shape of the Cross-Section using Symmetry:**\n    *   The cross-section is the polygon formed by the intersection of the central horizontal plane with the faces of the icosahedron.\n    *   Since the icosahedron has 3-fold rotational symmetry around the vertical axis and the cutting plane is perpendicular to this axis, the resulting cross-sectional shape must also have **3-fold rotational symmetry**.\n    *   Since the icosahedron has central symmetry and the cutting plane passes through the center, the resulting cross-section must also be **centrally symmetric**.\n    *   We now need to identify a polygon that satisfies both these symmetry conditions. Let's consider simple polygons:\n        *   A triangle has 3-fold symmetry but is not centrally symmetric.\n        *   A square is centrally symmetric but does not have 3-fold symmetry.\n        *   A pentagon is not centrally symmetric.\n        *   A **hexagon** can have both. For a hexagon to be both centrally symmetric and have 3-fold rotational symmetry, it must be a **regular hexagon**.\n\n6.  **Confirm the Number of Sides:**\n    *   The central plane is situated halfway between the top and bottom of the icosahedron. It is too low to intersect the faces adjacent to the top, and too high to intersect the faces adjacent to the base.\n    *   The plane cuts through the set of 6 faces that form the \"waist\" or \"equator\" of the icosahedron in this orientation.\n    *   The intersection of a plane with these 6 faces forms a six-sided polygon (a hexagon).\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Volume vs. Height:** Do not assume that half the volume means the water level is at half the total height. This is only true for shapes with constant cross-sectional area, like a cylinder or prism.\n*   **Symmetry is Key:** The argument relies heavily on the high degree of symmetry of the icosahedron. Direct calculation using coordinates is much more complex and prone to error.\n*   **The Power of Duality:** A useful check is to consider the dual polyhedron, the dodecahedron. An icosahedron on a face corresponds to a dodecahedron on a vertex. The silhouette (2D projection) of a dodecahedron viewed from a vertex is a regular hexagon, which corresponds to the central cross-section of the icosahedron in its dual orientation.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nCombining these steps, the water surface is the central cross-section of the icosahedron, perpendicular to a 3-fold axis of symmetry. This intersection forms a polygon with 6 sides, and due to the inherent symmetries of the setup, this polygon must be a regular hexagon.\n\n<<<A regular hexagon>>>"
