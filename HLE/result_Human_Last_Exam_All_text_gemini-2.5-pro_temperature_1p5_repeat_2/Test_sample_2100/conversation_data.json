    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Analyze Clue 1: \"Andrei Voznesensky called this man...\"**\n    This points to a specific work by the famous Soviet-era poet Andrei Voznesensky. The most relevant and famous work that fits the other clues is his libretto for the rock opera \"Juno and Avos\" (\"Юнона и Авось\"), first staged in 1981.\n\n2.  **Analyze Clue 2: \"...'a joy-discovering sailor'...\"**\n    This poetic description fits the protagonist of \"Juno and Avos,\" a historical figure who was an explorer. The protagonist is Count Nikolai Rezanov, a Russian nobleman, diplomat, and one of the leaders of the first Russian round-the-world expedition. He is poetically referred to as a sailor who discovered not just new lands, but the \"joy\" of connection and new possibilities.\n\n3.  **Analyze Clue 3: \"...and wondered, 'Where is your grave, even a mound?'\"**\n    This is a critical clue. It indicates that at the time Voznesensky wrote the poem, the burial place of this man was unknown. Historically, Nikolai Rezanov died in 1807 in Krasnoyarsk while traveling across Siberia to report to the Tsar. He was buried there, but his grave was lost when the cathedral and cemetery where he was interred were destroyed during the Soviet period. Voznesensky's poem directly laments this lost grave.\n\n4.  **Analyze Clue 4: \"The answer to this question emerged in the late 1980s.\"**\n    This sets a specific timeframe for the discovery of the grave. During the period of Glasnost and Perestroika in the late 1980s, there was a renewed interest in Russian history. Local historians and archaeologists in Krasnoyarsk undertook efforts to locate the lost grave of Nikolai Rezanov. Their research and excavations led to the successful identification of the burial site.\n\n5.  **Synthesize the Clues**\n    *   The man was the subject of a famous work by Andrei Voznesensky (\"Juno and Avos\").\n    *   He was an explorer, fitting the description \"sailor.\"\n    *   His grave was lost for a long time, a fact noted in the poem.\n    *   His grave was rediscovered in the late 1980s.\n    All these points uniquely identify the historical figure Count Nikolai Petrovich Rezanov. The question asks for his last name.\n\n**Final Conclusion**\n\nThe man described is Nikolai Rezanov, the protagonist of Voznesensky's \"Juno and Avos.\" His grave was lost after his death in 1807 and was rediscovered in Krasnoyarsk in the late 1980s.\n\n<<<Rezanov>>>"
