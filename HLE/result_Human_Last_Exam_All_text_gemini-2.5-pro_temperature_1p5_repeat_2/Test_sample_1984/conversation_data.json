    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the solution.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\nThe problem asks us to find the value of the expression $m - 2^{4048}$, where $m$ is related to the stable equilibrium points of the given differential equation:\n$$\nx'(t) = -x^{3}(t) + 2x^{2}(t) - x(t)\n$$\n\n**Step 2: Find the Equilibrium Points**\nEquilibrium points (or fixed points) are the values of $x$ for which the rate of change $x'(t)$ is zero. We set the right-hand side of the equation to zero and solve for $x$:\n$$\nf(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 - x = 0\n$$\nTo solve this cubic equation, we can factor out a common term, which is $-x$:\n$$\n-x(x^2 - 2x + 1) = 0\n$$\nThe quadratic part, $x^2 - 2x + 1$, is a perfect square trinomial: $(x-1)^2$. So the equation becomes:\n$$\n-x(x-1)^2 = 0\n$$\nThe solutions to this equation are the equilibrium points:\n$x_1 = 0$\n$x_2 = 1$\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Stability of Each Equilibrium Point**\nThe stability of an equilibrium point $x_0$ for a one-dimensional system $x' = f(x)$ can be determined by analyzing the sign of the derivative of $f(x)$ at that point, i.e., $f'(x_0)$.\n*   If $f'(x_0) < 0$, the equilibrium point is **stable**.\n*   If $f'(x_0) > 0$, the equilibrium point is **unstable**.\n*   If $f'(x_0) = 0$, the test is inconclusive, and we must use another method, like analyzing the sign of $f(x)$ around the equilibrium point (a phase line analysis).\n\nLet's find the derivative of $f(x)$:\n$f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 - x$\n$f'(x) = -3x^2 + 4x - 1$\n\nNow, we test each equilibrium point:\n\n*   **For x = 0:**\n    $f'(0) = -3(0)^2 + 4(0) - 1 = -1$\n    Since $f'(0) = -1 < 0$, the equilibrium point $x = 0$ is **stable**.\n\n*   **For x = 1:**\n    $f'(1) = -3(1)^2 + 4(1) - 1 = -3 + 4 - 1 = 0$\n    Since $f'(1) = 0$, the first derivative test is inconclusive. We perform a phase line analysis by checking the sign of $f(x) = -x(x-1)^2$ around $x=1$.\n    *   For $x$ slightly greater than 1 (e.g., $x = 1.1$), the term $-x$ is negative and $(x-1)^2$ is positive. Thus, $f(x) = (\\text{negative})(\\text{positive}) = \\text{negative}$. This means if $x > 1$, $x'(t) < 0$, and the system state moves towards $x=1$.\n    *   For $x$ slightly less than 1 (e.g., $x = 0.9$), the term $-x$ is negative and $(x-1)^2$ is positive. Thus, $f(x) = (\\text{negative})(\\text{positive}) = \\text{negative}$. This means if $x < 1$, $x'(t) < 0$, and the system state moves away from $x=1$.\n\nSince solutions starting near $x=1$ approach it from one side (the right) but move away from it on the other side (the left), $x=1$ is a **semi-stable** point. By standard definitions, a semi-stable point is not considered stable. A stable point must be attractive from both sides.\n\nTherefore, there is only one stable equilibrium point for this system: $x = 0$.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the value of m**\nThe problem states, \"Suppose that $m$ is a number of stable equilibrium\". This phrasing is slightly ambiguous. It could mean:\n1.  $m$ is the count of stable equilibrium points.\n2.  $m$ is the value of a stable equilibrium point.\n\nLet's analyze the phrasing. The phrase \"a number of\" is typically followed by a plural noun (e.g., \"a number of students\"). Here, it's followed by a singular concept (\"stable equilibrium\"). This suggests a non-standard meaning. In mathematics, a statement like \"Let $m$ be a root of the equation\" means $m$ takes the value of one of the roots. Similarly, \"$m$ is a number of stable equilibrium\" can be interpreted as \"$m$ takes the value of a stable equilibrium point\".\n\nFollowing this interpretation, since the only stable equilibrium point is at $x=0$, we have:\n$m = 0$\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Final Answer**\nWe need to compute $m - 2^{4048}$. Substituting the value of $m=0$:\n$$\n0 - 2^{4048} = -2^{4048}\n$$\n\n<<<$-2^{4048}$>>>"
