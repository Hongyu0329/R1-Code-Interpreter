    "Answering the question \"How many positive definite even lattices are there of dimension 17 and determinant 2?\" requires using the theory of classification of integral lattices (or quadratic forms). We are looking for the number of non-isomorphic (or non-isometric) lattices with these properties.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n### Step 1: Decompose the problem\nLet `L` be a positive definite even lattice of dimension 17 and determinant 2.\nAny such lattice `L` can be uniquely decomposed into an orthogonal direct sum of indecomposable lattices: `L = L_1 \\oplus L_2 \\oplus ... \\oplus L_k`.\n\nThe determinant of `L` is the product of the determinants of its components: `det(L) = det(L_1) * det(L_2) * ... * det(L_k)`.\nGiven that `L` is positive definite, each component `L_i` is also positive definite, and its determinant `det(L_i)` must be a positive integer.\nSince `det(L) = 2` (a prime number), this implies that exactly one of the indecomposable components, say `L_j`, must have `det(L_j) = 2`, and all other components `L_i` (for `i â‰  j`) must have `det(L_i) = 1`.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the components\n*   **Unimodular Components (`det=1`):** A lattice `L_i` with `det(L_i) = 1` is called unimodular. For a positive definite even unimodular lattice, its dimension must be a multiple of 8. Furthermore, if it's indecomposable, the only possibility is the `E_8` lattice (in dimension 8). There are no indecomposable even unimodular lattices in dimension 16 or 24.\n*   **Determinant 2 Component:** The component `L_j` is an indecomposable, positive definite, even lattice with `det(L_j) = 2`.\n\nSo, any lattice `L` satisfying the given conditions must be of the form:\n`L = (E_8 \\oplus ... \\oplus E_8) \\oplus L_j` (`k` copies of `E_8`)\nwhere `L_j` is an indecomposable even lattice with `det(L_j) = 2`.\n\n### Step 3: Use the dimension constraint\nThe total dimension of `L` is 17. The dimension is the sum of the dimensions of the components:\n`dim(L) = k * dim(E_8) + dim(L_j) = 8k + dim(L_j) = 17`.\n\nWe examine the possible integer values for `k >= 0`:\n*   **Case k=2:** `8*2 + dim(L_j) = 17 \\implies dim(L_j) = 1`.\n    We need an indecomposable, positive definite, even lattice of dimension 1 and determinant 2.\n    A 1D lattice is defined by its Gram matrix `[a]`, where `a` is the squared norm of the basis vector.\n    - `det=a=2`.\n    - even means `a` is an even integer, which `2` is.\n    - indecomposable: any 1D lattice is indecomposable.\n    - positive definite: `a>0`.\n    So, there is exactly one such lattice, the root lattice `A_1`.\n    This gives one possible structure for `L`: `L_1 = E_8 \\oplus E_8 \\oplus A_1`.\n\n*   **Case k=1:** `8*1 + dim(L_j) = 17 \\implies dim(L_j) = 9`.\n    We need an indecomposable, positive definite, even lattice of dimension 9 and determinant 2. According to the known classifications of lattices (for example, in the database by G. Nebe and N.J.A. Sloane), there are no such indecomposable lattices. The only isomorphism class of a positive definite even lattice of dimension 9 and determinant 2 is `E_8 \\oplus A_1`, which is decomposable. Therefore, this case does not produce any new lattices.\n\n*   **Case k=0:** `8*0 + dim(L_j) = 17 \\implies dim(L_j) = 17`.\n    Here, the entire lattice `L` must be indecomposable (`L = L_j`). We need to count the number of indecomposable, positive definite, even lattices of dimension 17 and determinant 2.\n    This is a known result in lattice theory. According to the classification work by experts like Venkov and Scharlau, there is exactly **one** such indecomposable lattice. This lattice has a root system (the set of its vectors of squared length 2) of type `A_1 \\oplus D_{16}`. Let's call this lattice `L_2`.\n\n### Step 4: Systematically count all possibilities\nThe previous analysis focused on building lattices from their indecomposable parts. An alternative is to consider all decomposable lattices first and then add the indecomposable ones.\n\nA. **Indecomposable Lattices:**\nFrom Step 3 (Case k=0), we found there is exactly **1** indecomposable lattice with the given properties.\n\nB. **Decomposable Lattices:**\nIf `L` is decomposable, `L = L_a \\oplus L_b`, where `L_a, L_b` are non-zero.\nThen `det(L_a) * det(L_b) = 2`. Since determinants are positive integers, this means `(det(L_a), det(L_b)) = (1, 2)`.\n`L_a` is an even unimodular lattice, so `dim(L_a)` must be a multiple of 8.\n`dim(L_a) + dim(L_b) = 17`.\n\n*   **Subcase dim(L_a)=16:**\n    - `dim(L_b)=1`. For `L_b`, `det=2`, even, positive definite. This uniquely determines `L_b` to be the `A_1` lattice.\n    - For `L_a`, we need to count the even unimodular lattices of dimension 16. There are exactly two such lattices: `E_8 \\oplus E_8` and the lattice `D_{16}^+`.\n    - This gives two distinct decomposable lattices:\n        1.  `(E_8 \\oplus E_8) \\oplus A_1`\n        2.  `D_{16}^+ \\oplus A_1`\n\n*   **Subcase dim(L_a)=8:**\n    - `dim(L_b)=9`. `L_a` must be the unique `E_8` lattice.\n    - `L_b` must be an even lattice of dimension 9 and determinant 2. As established before, there is only one such lattice, which is `E_8 \\oplus A_1`.\n    - This gives the decomposition `E_8 \\oplus (E_8 \\oplus A_1)`, which is the same as the first lattice found in the previous subcase.\n\nSo, there are exactly **2** decomposable lattices with the given properties.\n\n### Step 5: Final Count\nTotal number of lattices = (Number of indecomposable lattices) + (Number of decomposable lattices)\nTotal = 1 + 2 = 3.\n\nThe three lattices are:\n1.  `E_8 \\oplus E_8 \\oplus A_1` (decomposable)\n2.  `D_{16}^+ \\oplus A_1` (decomposable)\n3.  The unique indecomposable even lattice of dimension 17 and determinant 2.\n\n<<<3>>>"
