    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which word has not undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core concept of Trisyllabic Laxing (TSL)**\n\nTrisyllabic Laxing is a historical sound change in English where a tense vowel (like the \"i\" in *divine*) becomes a lax vowel (the \"i\" in *divinity*) when it occurs in the antepenultimate syllable (the third syllable from the end of a word). This typically happens when a suffix is added to a base word.\n\n*   **Tense Vowels:** /iː/ (as in m**ee**t), /eɪ/ (as in m**a**te), /aɪ/ (as in m**i**te), /oʊ/ (as in m**o**te), /uː/ (as in m**u**te).\n*   **Lax Vowels:** /ɪ/ (as in k**i**t), /ɛ/ (as in dr**e**ss), /æ/ (as in tr**a**p), /ɒ/ or /ʌ/ (as in l**o**t or str**u**t).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze each word for evidence of Trisyllabic Laxing**\n\nWe will check each word by comparing it to its base form and examining the vowel sound, syllable count, and position of the vowel change.\n\n1.  **southern**\n    *   **Base Word:** *south* (pronounced /saʊθ/, with a tense diphthong).\n    *   **Word:** *southern* (pronounced /ˈsʌðərn/, with a lax vowel /ʌ/).\n    *   **Analysis:** The vowel sound does change from tense to lax. However, *southern* has only two syllables (`sou-thern`). The vowel is in the penultimate (second-to-last) syllable, not the antepenultimate (third-to-last). Therefore, this is not an example of *trisyllabic* laxing.\n\n2.  **derivative**\n    *   **Base Word:** *derive* (pronounced /dɪˈraɪv/, with a tense vowel /aɪ/).\n    *   **Word:** *derivative* (pronounced /dɪˈrɪvətɪv/, with a lax vowel /ɪ/).\n    *   **Analysis:** The word has four syllables (`de-riv-a-tive`). The vowel change occurs in the second syllable \"-riv-\", which is the antepenultimate syllable. The tense vowel /aɪ/ has become the lax vowel /ɪ/. This is a classic example of trisyllabic laxing.\n\n3.  **serenity**\n    *   **Base Word:** *serene* (pronounced /səˈriːn/, with a tense vowel /iː/).\n    *   **Word:** *serenity* (pronounced /səˈrɛnɪti/, with a lax vowel /ɛ/).\n    *   **Analysis:** The word has four syllables (`se-ren-i-ty`). The vowel change occurs in the second syllable \"-ren-\", which is the antepenultimate syllable. The tense vowel /iː/ has become the lax vowel /ɛ/. This is another classic example of trisyllabic laxing.\n\n4.  **pleasant**\n    *   **Base Word:** *please* (pronounced /pliːz/, with a tense vowel /iː/).\n    *   **Word:** *pleasant* (pronounced /ˈplɛzənt/, with a lax vowel /ɛ/).\n    *   **Analysis:** The vowel sound changes from tense to lax. However, *pleasant* has only two syllables (`plea-sant`). The vowel is in the penultimate syllable. This is an example of a different sound rule (Pre-cluster Shortening), not trisyllabic laxing.\n\n5.  **gratitude**\n    *   **Base Word:** *grate* (pronounced /ɡreɪt/, with a tense vowel /eɪ/).\n    *   **Word:** *gratitude* (pronounced /ˈɡrætɪtjuːd/, with a lax vowel /æ/).\n    *   **Analysis:** The word has three syllables (`grat-i-tude`). The vowel change occurs in the first syllable \"grat-\", which is the antepenultimate syllable. The tense vowel /eɪ/ has become the lax vowel /æ/. This is a clear example of trisyllabic laxing.\n\n6.  **shadow**\n    *   **Base Word:** There is no modern English base word with a tense vowel from which *shadow* is derived (e.g., it does not come from *shade*).\n    *   **Word:** *shadow* (pronounced /ˈʃædoʊ/).\n    *   **Analysis:** Historically, *shadow* comes from Old English *sceadu*, where the first vowel was already a short, lax vowel /æ/. The vowel was never tense, so it could not have been \"laxed.\" The process of changing a tense vowel to a lax one never occurred.\n\n**Step 3: Compare the results and determine the final answer**\n\n*   **Have undergone TSL:** `derivative`, `serenity`, `gratitude`.\n*   **Have not undergone TSL:** `southern`, `pleasant`, `shadow`.\n\nWe need to select the best answer from the three words that did not undergo TSL. While *southern* and *pleasant* do show a laxing process, it is not TSL because the syllable structure is wrong. However, *shadow* is an even stronger case because its vowel was never tense to begin with. The process of laxing (a change from tense to lax) could not have occurred at all. This makes it the most definitive example of a word on the list that has not undergone this sound change.\n\n<<<shadow>>>"
