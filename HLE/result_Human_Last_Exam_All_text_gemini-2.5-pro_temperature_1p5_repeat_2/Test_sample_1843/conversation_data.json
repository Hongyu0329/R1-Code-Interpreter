    "Answering this question requires a step-by-step analysis of Dirichlet characters, their conductors, and orders.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the structure of the problem\n\nWe need to find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters $\\chi$ of conductor $N = 36036$ and order 6.\n\nFirst, we factorize the conductor $N$:\n$N = 36036 = 36 \\times 1001 = (4 \\times 9) \\times (7 \\times 11 \\times 13) = 2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7^1 \\cdot 11^1 \\cdot 13^1$.\n\nA Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $N$ can be uniquely decomposed into a product of characters modulo the prime power factors of $N$:\n$\\chi = \\chi_4 \\chi_9 \\chi_7 \\chi_{11} \\chi_{13}$\nwhere $\\chi_q$ is a character modulo $q$ for $q \\in \\{4, 9, 7, 11, 13\\}$.\n\nFor $\\chi$ to be a **primitive** character of conductor $N$, each component character $\\chi_q$ must be a primitive character of conductor $q$.\n\nThe **order** of $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters:\n$\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_4), \\text{ord}(\\chi_9), \\text{ord}(\\chi_7), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{11}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{13}))$.\n\nWe require this order to be 6.\n\nSo, the problem boils down to finding the number of tuples of primitive characters $(\\chi_4, \\chi_9, \\chi_7, \\chi_{11}, \\chi_{13})$ such that the lcm of their orders is 6.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the possible orders for each primitive component character\n\nLet $d_q = \\text{ord}(\\chi_q)$. For the lcm to be 6, each $d_q$ must be a divisor of 6. Let's find the number of primitive characters for each conductor $q$ for each possible order $d$ that divides 6.\n\nLet $C(q, d)$ denote the number of primitive characters modulo $q$ of order $d$. The order of a character modulo $q$ must divide $\\phi(q)$.\n\n1.  **Conductor $q=4=2^2$**:\n    *   $\\phi(4) = 2$. The group of characters $\\mathcal{X}_4$ has 2 elements.\n    *   The only primitive character modulo 4 is non-principal, which has order 2. So $d_4 = 2$. This order divides 6.\n    *   Number of choices: $C(4, 2) = 1$.\n\n2.  **Conductor $q=9=3^2$**:\n    *   $\\phi(9) = 6$. The group of characters $\\mathcal{X}_9$ is cyclic of order 6.\n    *   The imprimitive characters mod 9 are induced from characters mod 3. $\\phi(3)=2$. These characters have orders 1 and 2.\n    *   Therefore, primitive characters mod 9 must have orders that are in $\\{1,2,3,6\\}$ but not in $\\{1,2\\}$. So, possible orders are $d_9 \\in \\{3, 6\\}$. Both of these divide 6.\n    *   The number of characters of order $d$ in a cyclic group of order $n$ (where $d|n$) is $\\phi(d)$.\n    *   Number of choices: $C(9, 3) = \\phi(3) = 2$, and $C(9, 6) = \\phi(6) = 2$.\n    *   Total choices for $\\chi_9$: $2 + 2 = 4$.\n\n3.  **Conductor $q=7$**:\n    *   $\\phi(7) = 6$.\n    *   A character mod a prime $p$ is primitive if it is not the principal character (which has order 1).\n    *   The possible orders are divisors of 6, except 1. So $d_7 \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$. All of these divide 6.\n    *   Number of choices: $C(7, 2) = \\phi(2) = 1$, $C(7, 3) = \\phi(3) = 2$, $C(7, 6) = \\phi(6) = 2$.\n    *   Total choices for $\\chi_7$: $1 + 2 + 2 = 5$.\n\n4.  **Conductor $q=11$**:\n    *   $\\phi(11) = 10$.\n    *   Possible primitive orders are divisors of 10 greater than 1, so $d_{11} \\in \\{2, 5, 10\\}$.\n    *   For the lcm to be 6, $d_{11}$ must divide 6. The only order in the list that divides 6 is 2. So we must have $d_{11}=2$.\n    *   Number of choices: $C(11, 2) = \\phi(2) = 1$.\n\n5.  **Conductor $q=13$**:\n    *   $\\phi(13) = 12$.\n    *   Possible primitive orders are divisors of 12 greater than 1, so $d_{13} \\in \\{2, 3, 4, 6, 12\\}$.\n    *   For the lcm to be 6, $d_{13}$ must divide 6. The orders in the list that divide 6 are $\\{2, 3, 6\\}$.\n    *   Number of choices: $C(13, 2) = \\phi(2) = 1$, $C(13, 3) = \\phi(3) = 2$, $C(13, 6) = \\phi(6) = 2$.\n    *   Total choices for $\\chi_{13}$: $1 + 2 + 2 = 5$.\n\n### Step 3: Combine the results\n\nWe need to find the total number of combinations of these primitive characters such that the lcm of their orders is 6.\nThe condition $\\text{lcm}(d_4, d_9, d_7, d_{11}, d_{13}) = 6$ requires:\na) All orders $d_q$ must divide 6 (which we have already enforced).\nb) At least one order must be a multiple of 2.\nc) At least one order must be a multiple of 3.\n\nLet's check these conditions:\n*   Condition (b): The order of $\\chi_4$ must be $d_4=2$. The order of $\\chi_{11}$ must be $d_{11}=2$. Therefore, any valid combination will have an order lcm that is a multiple of 2.\n*   Condition (c): The order of $\\chi_9$ must be $d_9 \\in \\{3, 6\\}$. Both are multiples of 3. Therefore, any valid combination will have an order lcm that is a multiple of 3.\n\nSince any combination of the allowed primitive characters results in an lcm divisible by both 2 and 3, and all individual orders divide 6, the final lcm must be exactly 6.\n\nTherefore, the total number of such characters is simply the product of the number of choices for each component.\n\n*   Number of choices for $\\chi_4$: 1\n*   Number of choices for $\\chi_9$: 4\n*   Number of choices for $\\chi_7$: 5\n*   Number of choices for $\\chi_{11}$: 1\n*   Number of choices for $\\chi_{13}$: 5\n\nTotal number of characters = $1 \\times 4 \\times 5 \\times 1 \\times 5 = 100$."
