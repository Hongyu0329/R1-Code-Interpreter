    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the length of the Second Great War in StarCraft Lore.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Define the Scope of the Second Great War:** The Second Great War refers to the galactic conflict depicted throughout the *StarCraft II* trilogy (*Wings of Liberty*, *Heart of the Swarm*, and *Legacy of the Void*). The war encompasses the Terran-Zerg conflict, the unification of the Protoss, and the united fight against the fallen Xel'naga, Amon.\n\n2.  **Establish the Start Date:** The war begins at the start of the *StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty* campaign. According to the official in-game and canonical timeline, this occurs four years after the end of the Brood War (which ended in 2500). Therefore, the Second Great War starts in the year **2504**.\n\n3.  **Establish the End Date:** The war concludes with the ultimate defeat of Amon. This event does not happen at the end of the main *Legacy of the Void* campaign (the retaking of Aiur), but rather in its epilogue campaign, *Into the Void*. The timeline confirms that the final battle and Amon's destruction in the Void occurs in the year **2508**.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Elapsed Time:** The war starts in the year 2504 and ends in the year 2508.\n    *   The events of 2504 occur (*Wings of Liberty*).\n    *   The events of 2505 occur (*Heart of the Swarm*).\n    *   The events of 2506 occur (*Legacy of the Void* main campaign).\n    *   The year 2507 passes as the factions prepare for the final confrontation.\n    *   The war ends during the year 2508 (*Into the Void* epilogue).\n\n    The total duration is the time from a point in 2504 to a point in 2508. This is a span of more than four full years, but not five full years. The exact duration would be 4 years and some number of months.\n\n5.  **Apply the Rounding Rule:** The question requires the answer to be **rounded up** to the nearest whole year. Since the calculated duration is greater than 4 years (e.g., 4.x years), rounding this value *up* to the next whole number gives 5.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **The War's True Endpoint:** A common mistake is to consider the end of the *Wings of Liberty* or *Legacy of the Void* main campaigns as the end of the war. The definitive end of the conflict against the primary antagonist, Amon, is the conclusion of the *Into the Void* epilogue.\n*   **Time Gaps:** The story has time skips between expansions. For instance, there is roughly a year between the end of *Heart of the Swarm* (early 2505) and the start of *Legacy of the Void* (2506). However, this period is still considered part of the overarching war, as the threat was present and the factions were preparing for the next major conflict phase.\n*   **The \"Rounded Up\" Clause:** This is the most critical part of the question. A simple subtraction (2508 - 2504 = 4) is inaccurate because it doesn't account for the duration spanning across years. Because the conflict was longer than exactly 4 years, the instruction to round up forces the answer to the next integer.\n\n<<<5>>>"
