    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the smallest number of composants an indecomposable continuum can have.\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the core concepts**\n\n*   **Continuum:** A continuum is a compact, connected Hausdorff space. The question specifies \"not necessarily metric,\" so we must use this general topological definition, not one restricted to metric spaces.\n*   **Indecomposable Continuum:** A continuum `X` is indecomposable if it cannot be expressed as the union of two of its proper subcontinua. A subcontinuum is a subset of `X` which is also a continuum (i.e., it is closed and connected).\n*   **Composant:** For a point `x` in a continuum `X`, the composant of `x`, denoted `C(x)`, is the set of all points `y` in `X` such that there exists a proper subcontinuum of `X` containing both `x` and `y`.\n\n**Step 2: Relating Composants to Decomposability**\n\nThe number of composants is directly related to whether a continuum is decomposable or indecomposable.\n*   A decomposable continuum has exactly one composant. In a decomposable continuum `X = A U B` (where A and B are proper subcontinua), any two points can be shown to lie in a common proper subcontinuum, and thus belong to the same composant. So, the entire space `X` is a single composant.\n*   Conversely, a continuum with only one composant is decomposable.\n*   Therefore, an **indecomposable continuum must have more than one composant**. This means the number of composants must be at least 2.\n\n**Step 3: Analyzing the Number of Composants in Metric Continua**\n\nIf we were restricted to *metric* continua, a famous theorem by Stefan Mazurkiewicz provides the answer.\n*   **Mazurkiewicz's Theorem:** Every indecomposable *metric* continuum has `c` (the cardinality of the continuum) composants.\n*   **Reasoning behind the theorem:** The proof relies on the Baire Category Theorem. In a metric continuum `X`, one can show that each composant is an `F_σ` set (a countable union of closed sets). Because `X` is indecomposable, every proper subcontinuum is nowhere dense. This implies that each composant is a set of the first category (a meagre set). If `X` had only a countable number of composants, then `X` itself would be of the first category. However, as a compact metric space, `X` is a complete metric space, and the Baire Category Theorem states that a complete metric space is of the second category in itself. This contradiction proves that the number of composants must be uncountable. For a separable metric space like a metric continuum, the cardinality cannot exceed `c`, so the number of composants is exactly `c`.\n*   This theorem confirms that for the well-known examples of indecomposable *metric* continua (like solenoids, the pseudo-arc, or Knaster continua), the number of composants is `c`.\n\n**Step 4: Analyzing the Number of Composants in Non-Metric Continua**\n\nThe question explicitly states \"not necessarily metric.\" This is the critical part of the question.\n*   The argument from Step 3 fails for non-metric continua. The proof that a composant is an `F_σ` set (and therefore of the first category) relies on the space having a countable base (i.e., being second-countable), which is a property of metric continua but not of all continua.\n*   A compact Hausdorff space is a Baire space, so the Baire Category Theorem itself still applies. However, without the guarantee that a composant is of the first category, the proof does not go through.\n*   This opens the possibility that a non-metric indecomposable continuum could have a number of composants different from `c`. It could potentially have a finite number or a countably infinite number of composants.\n\n**Step 5: Seeking an Example with the Minimum Number of Composants**\n\nSince an indecomposable continuum must have at least 2 composants, the smallest possible number is 2. The question then becomes: does there exist an indecomposable continuum with exactly 2 composants?\n*   The answer is yes. Such spaces, while not metric, have been constructed.\n*   A notable example was constructed by D. P. Bellamy in his 1971 paper, \"An indecomposable continuum with two composants\". He constructed a non-metric, compact, connected Hausdorff space that is indecomposable and proved that it has exactly two composants. The construction involves the Stone-Čech compactification of a specific metric space derived from a solenoid.\n\n**Step 6: Final Conclusion**\n\n1.  An indecomposable continuum must have more than one composant.\n2.  The minimum possible number of composants is therefore 2.\n3.  The existence of an indecomposable (non-metric) continuum with exactly 2 composants has been demonstrated in the mathematical literature.\n\nThus, the smallest number of composants an indecomposable (not necessarily metric) continuum can have is 2.\n\n<<<2>>>"
