The verses were written by the Spanish poet **Rafael Alberti**. They are from his poem "Ángel de los números," part of the 1929 collection *Sobre los ángeles*. The work of art to which they are considered to be directed or heavily influenced by is the series of etchings ***Carceri d'invenzione*** **(Imaginary Prisons)** by the 18th-century Italian artist **Giovanni Battista Piranesi**.
