    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Identify the specific paper in question.**\nThe question refers to Albert Einstein's 1905 paper on Brownian motion. The full title of this paper is \"Über die von der molekularkinetischen Theorie der Wärme geforderte Bewegung von in ruhenden Flüssigkeiten suspendierten Teilchen\" (\"On the Motion of Small Particles Suspended in a Stationary Liquid Required by the Molecular-Kinetic Theory of Heat\"). This was one of his four famous \"Annus Mirabilis\" (miracle year) papers.\n\n**Step 2: Investigate the citation practices of the 1905 paper.**\nA critical point to understand about Einstein's 1905 papers is that they are famous for their near-complete lack of citations or references to previous work. Einstein preferred to derive his conclusions from fundamental principles, and the paper on Brownian motion is no exception. A direct examination of the 1905 paper shows no bibliography and no footnotes citing the work of other scientists.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the potential for a misunderstanding in the question.**\nGiven that the 1905 paper has no citations, the question might be based on a slight inaccuracy. It could be conflating the 1905 paper with a very closely related follow-up paper or referring to an intellectual influence that was later formally cited.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the key intellectual influence and look for the specific \"lectures\".**\nThe scientific foundation for Einstein's paper is the kinetic theory of heat, a field pioneered and dominated by the Austrian physicist Ludwig Boltzmann. Boltzmann's major work on the subject was a two-volume book titled **\"Vorlesungen über Gastheorie\"**, which translates to **\"Lectures on Gas Theory\"**. This is the specific set of \"lectures\" that Einstein studied and was deeply influenced by.\n\n**Step 5: Check subsequent related papers for a citation.**\nWhile Einstein did not cite Boltzmann in the 1905 paper, he did so in a follow-up paper on the same subject published in 1906 titled \"Zur Theorie der Brownschen Bewegung\" (\"On the Theory of Brownian Motion\"). In this 1906 paper, Einstein explicitly references the work of **Ludwig Boltzmann** and his **\"Lectures on Gas Theory\"**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nStrictly answering for the **1905** paper, the answer would be \"no one\". However, it is a near certainty that the question is referring to the foundational work that influenced Einstein and which he cited in his broader work on Brownian motion during that period. The person whose lectures were explicitly cited in his early work on this topic was Ludwig Boltzmann.\n\n<<<Ludwig Boltzmann"
