    "**1. Understanding the Goal**\n\nWe want to find a left coprime factorization of the transfer function matrix $H(s)$. This means we need to find two polynomial matrices, $D(s)$ and $N(s)$, that satisfy three conditions:\n1.  $H(s) = D^{-1}(s) N(s)$\n2.  $D(s)$ and $N(s)$ are left coprime.\n3.  $D(s)$ is a non-singular polynomial matrix, and $N(s)$ is a polynomial matrix.\n\n**2. Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**Step 1: Set up the equation**\n\nThe defining equation for a left factorization is $H(s) = D^{-1}(s) N(s)$. We can rewrite this as:\n\\[\nD(s) H(s) = N(s)\n\\]\nLet $D(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} d_{11}(s) & d_{12}(s) \\\\ d_{21}(s) & d_{22}(s) \\end{bmatrix}$. Substituting $D(s)$ and $H(s)$ into the equation gives:\n\\[\nN(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} d_{11}(s) & d_{12}(s) \\\\ d_{21}(s) & d_{22}(s) \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{s-1}{s+1} & 1 \\\\ \\frac{2}{s^2-1} & 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\\[\nN(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} d_{11}(s) \\frac{s-1}{s+1} + d_{12}(s) \\frac{2}{s^2-1} & d_{11}(s) \\\\ d_{21}(s) \\frac{s-1}{s+1} + d_{22}(s) \\frac{2}{s^2-1} & d_{21}(s) \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine constraints for $D(s)$**\n\nFor $N(s)$ to be a polynomial matrix, all its entries must be polynomials.\n*   From the second column of $N(s)$, it's clear that $d_{11}(s)$ and $d_{21}(s)$ must be polynomials. This is already true by the definition of $D(s)$.\n*   For the entry $N_{11}(s)$, we need the expression to be a polynomial:\n    \\[\n    N_{11}(s) = \\frac{d_{11}(s)(s-1)^2 + 2d_{12}(s)}{(s-1)(s+1)}\n    \\]\n    The numerator must be divisible by both $(s-1)$ and $(s+1)$.\n    *   **At s = 1:** The numerator becomes $d_{11}(1)(1-1)^2 + 2d_{12}(1) = 2d_{12}(1)$. For this to be zero, we must have $d_{12}(1) = 0$. This implies $d_{12}(s)$ must have a factor of $(s-1)$.\n    *   **At s = -1:** The numerator becomes $d_{11}(-1)(-1-1)^2 + 2d_{12}(-1) = 4d_{11}(-1) + 2d_{12}(-1)$. For this to be zero, we need $2d_{11}(-1) + d_{12}(-1) = 0$.\n*   Similarly, for the entry $N_{21}(s)$, we have the same conditions for $d_{21}(s)$ and $d_{22}(s)$:\n    *   $d_{22}(s)$ must have a factor of $(s-1)$, so $d_{22}(1)=0$.\n    *   $2d_{21}(-1) + d_{22}(-1) = 0$.\n\n**Step 3: Construct a minimal polynomial matrix $D(s)$**\n\nWe need to find the simplest polynomial matrix $D(s)$ that satisfies these conditions and is non-singular.\n\n*   **For the first row of D(s):**\n    We need $d_{12}(s)$ to be a multiple of $(s-1)$. Let's try the simplest choice: $d_{12}(s) = c(s-1)$ for some constant $c$.\n    We also need $2d_{11}(-1) + d_{12}(-1) = 0$. Substituting $d_{12}(s)$, we get $2d_{11}(-1) + c(-1-1) = 0$, which simplifies to $d_{11}(-1) = c$.\n    Let's choose the simplest non-zero constants. If we pick $c=1$, then we need $d_{11}(-1)=1$. The simplest polynomial for $d_{11}(s)$ is the constant $d_{11}(s) = 1$.\n    So, a candidate for the first row is $[d_{11}(s), d_{12}(s)] = [1, s-1]$.\n\n*   **For the second row of D(s):**\n    We need $d_{22}(s)$ to be a multiple of $(s-1)$. Let's try the simplest choice $d_{22}(s)=0$. This satisfies the condition.\n    We also need $2d_{21}(-1) + d_{22}(-1) = 0$. With $d_{22}(s)=0$, this becomes $2d_{21}(-1)=0$, so $d_{21}(-1)=0$.\n    The simplest non-zero polynomial for $d_{21}(s)$ with a root at $s=-1$ is $d_{21}(s) = s+1$.\n    So, a candidate for the second row is $[d_{21}(s), d_{22}(s)] = [s+1, 0]$.\n\nThis gives us the matrix $D(s)$:\n\\[\nD(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & s-1 \\\\ s+1 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nWe must check if it's non-singular. The determinant is $\\det(D(s)) = (1)(0) - (s-1)(s+1) = -(s^2-1) = 1-s^2$. Since the determinant is not identically zero, $D(s)$ is non-singular.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the corresponding $N(s)$**\n\nNow we compute $N(s) = D(s)H(s)$:\n\\[\nN(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & s-1 \\\\ s+1 & 0 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{s-1}{s+1} & 1 \\\\ \\frac{2}{s^2-1} & 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\\[\nN(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} (1)\\frac{s-1}{s+1} + (s-1)\\frac{2}{s^2-1} & (1)(1)+(s-1)(0) \\\\ (s+1)\\frac{s-1}{s+1}+(0)\\frac{2}{s^2-1} & (s+1)(1)+(0)(0) \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\\[\nN(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{s-1}{s+1} + \\frac{2(s-1)}{(s-1)(s+1)} & 1 \\\\ s-1 & s+1 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\\[\nN(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{s-1+2}{s+1} & 1 \\\\ s-1 & s+1 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{s+1}{s+1} & 1 \\\\ s-1 & s+1 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ s-1 & s+1 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nAs required, $N(s)$ is a polynomial matrix.\n\n**Step 5: Verify left coprimeness**\n\nThe matrices $D(s)$ and $N(s)$ are left coprime if the composite matrix $[D(s) \\quad N(s)]$ has full row rank (i.e., rank 2) for all complex values of $s$.\n\\[\n[D(s) \\quad N(s)] = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & s-1 & 1 & 1 \\\\ s+1 & 0 & s-1 & s+1 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nThe rank of this $2 \\times 4$ matrix is less than 2 if and only if all its $2 \\times 2$ minors are zero for some value of $s$. Let's compute one of the minors. For instance, the minor formed by columns 1 and 3:\n\\[\n\\det \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ s+1 & s-1 \\end{pmatrix} = (1)(s-1) - (1)(s+1) = s - 1 - s - 1 = -2\n\\]\nSince this minor is a non-zero constant, it is never zero for any value of $s$. This guarantees that the rank of the matrix $[D(s) \\quad N(s)]$ is always 2.\nTherefore, $D(s)$ and $N(s)$ are left coprime.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nA left coprime factorization $H(s) = D^{-1}(s)N(s)$ is given by:\n\\[\nD(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & s-1 \\\\ s+1 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\\[\nN(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ s-1 & s+1 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\n<<<\n\\[ D(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & s-1 \\\\ s+1 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}, \\quad N(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ s-1 & s+1 \\end{bmatrix} \\]\n>>>"
