No, polynucleotides (including homopolynucleotides) are not structurally polysaccharides. They are a distinct class of macromolecules with different monomeric units (nucleotides vs. monosaccharides), different backbone structures (sugar-phosphate vs. sugar-only), and different chemical bonds linking the monomers (phosphodiester vs. glycosidic bonds).
