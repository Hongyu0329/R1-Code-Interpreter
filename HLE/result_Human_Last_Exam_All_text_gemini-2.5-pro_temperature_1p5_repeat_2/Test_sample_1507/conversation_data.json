    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the minimal number of triangles needed for triangulating the outer-hull of the great icosahedron.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understand the Object:** The question is about the \"great icosahedron\". This is one of the four Kepler-Poinsot polyhedra, which are non-convex regular polyhedra (star polyhedra). It is composed of 20 intersecting equilateral triangular faces.\n\n2.  **Identify the \"Outer-Hull\":** The question asks for the triangulation of the \"outer-hull\". The outer-hull of any non-convex object is its **convex hull**. The convex hull is the smallest convex shape that completely contains the object. For a polyhedron, the convex hull can be visualized as stretching a rubber sheet over its vertices.\n\n3.  **Determine the Convex Hull of the Great Icosahedron:** The vertices of the great icosahedron are the same as the 12 vertices of a standard **regular icosahedron**. Therefore, the convex hull of the great icosahedron is a regular icosahedron.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Surface to be Triangulated:** We need to find the minimal triangulation for the surface of the regular icosahedron. A \"triangulation\" of a surface means dividing it completely into a set of non-overlapping triangles.\n\n5.  **Examine the Faces of a Regular Icosahedron:** A regular icosahedron is a Platonic solid. By definition, its surface is composed of 20 identical equilateral triangles.\n\n6.  **Evaluate the \"Minimal Number\" Requirement:** Since the surface of the regular icosahedron is already made up of 20 triangular faces, this is itself a valid triangulation. To have fewer than 20 triangles would require changing the fundamental structure (the number of vertices or the topology), which isn't what triangulation means. Any further division of these 20 triangles (e.g., splitting each one into two or more smaller triangles) would result in a *larger* number of triangles. Therefore, the most natural and simplest triangulation, using the faces of the icosahedron itself, is the minimal one.\n\n7.  **Confirm with Euler's Polyhedron Formula:** For any convex polyhedron, the formula V - E + F = 2 holds, where V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, and F is the number of faces.\n    *   The regular icosahedron (our convex hull) has V = 12 vertices.\n    *   For any triangulation, every edge is shared by two triangles, and every triangle has 3 edges. This gives the relationship 2E = 3F.\n    *   Now we can solve for F:\n        *   From V - E + F = 2, we have 12 - E + F = 2, which means E = F + 10.\n        *   Substitute this into 2E = 3F: 2(F + 10) = 3F.\n        *   2F + 20 = 3F.\n        *   F = 20.\n    *   This confirms that any triangulation of a sphere-like surface with 12 vertices must consist of exactly 20 triangles.\n\n8.  **Consider \"Visible from the Outside\":** This phrase simply reinforces that we are concerned with the external surface, which is the convex hull. All 20 faces of the convex regular icosahedron are visible from the outside.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe outer-hull of the great icosahedron is a regular icosahedron. The surface of a regular icosahedron is already composed of 20 triangular faces. This constitutes the minimal possible triangulation for this shape.\n\nThe minimal number of triangles needed is 20.\n\n<<<20>>>"
