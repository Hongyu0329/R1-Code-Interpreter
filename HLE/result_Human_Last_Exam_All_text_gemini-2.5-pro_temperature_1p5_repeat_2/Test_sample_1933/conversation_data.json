    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the components of the question\n\n*   **Schema S**: The schema $S$ consists of 4 unary predicates. Let's denote them as $P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4$. A unary predicate takes one argument, so we have atomic formulas like $P_i(x)$.\n*   **Language $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$**: This is a fragment of first-order logic.\n    *   Formulas are built using atomic formulas from schema $S$ (e.g., $P_i(x)$).\n    *   Allowed logical connectives are conjunction ($\\land$) and the constants True ($\\top$) and False ($\\bot$).\n    *   The only allowed quantifier is the existential quantifier ($\\exists$).\n    *   Negation ($\\neg$), disjunction ($\\lor$), implication ($\\rightarrow$), and the universal quantifier ($\\forall$) are not allowed. Equality is also not part of this fragment.\n*   **VC dimension**: We are asked for the VC dimension of the set of concepts defined by this language. A concept is a set of elements defined by a formula with one free variable.\n    *   A **concept class** is the set of all such definable sets. A formula $\\phi(x)$ with one free variable $x$ defines a set $\\{a \\in U \\mid \\mathcal{M} \\models \\phi(a)\\}$ in a given model $\\mathcal{M}$ with universe $U$.\n    *   A set of points $X \\subseteq U$ is **shattered** by a concept class if for every subset $Y \\subseteq X$, there is a concept $C$ in the class such that $C \\cap X = Y$.\n    *   The **VC dimension** is the size of the largest set that can be shattered.\n\n### Step 2: Characterize the formulas and the concepts they define\n\nLet's analyze the structure of a formula $\\phi(x)$ in this language with one free variable, $x$.\nAny such formula is built from atomic formulas $P_i(z)$ (where $z$ is any variable) using $\\land$ and $\\exists$.\n\nA general formula $\\phi(x)$ can be written in prenex normal form as $\\exists y_1 \\dots \\exists y_m \\psi(x, y_1, \\dots, y_m)$, where $\\psi$ is a quantifier-free formula. Since the only connective is $\\land$, $\\psi$ is a conjunction of atomic formulas.\n\nWe can group the atomic formulas in $\\psi$ by the variable they contain.\n$\\psi(x, \\vec{y}) = \\left(\\bigwedge_{i \\in I_0} P_i(x)\\right) \\land \\left(\\bigwedge_{i \\in I_1} P_i(y_1)\\right) \\land \\dots \\land \\left(\\bigwedge_{i \\in I_m} P_i(y_m)\\right)$.\nLet's rewrite $\\phi(x)$ by distributing the existential quantifiers:\n$\\phi(x) = \\left(\\bigwedge_{i \\in I_0} P_i(x)\\right) \\land \\left(\\exists y_1 \\bigwedge_{i \\in I_1} P_i(y_1)\\right) \\land \\dots \\land \\left(\\exists y_m \\bigwedge_{i \\in I_m} P_i(y_m)\\right)$.\n\nLet's look at the structure of this formula. It is a conjunction of two types of parts:\n1.  A quantifier-free part involving $x$: $\\psi_0(x) = \\bigwedge_{i \\in I_0} P_i(x)$.\n2.  A set of sentences (formulas without free variables): $S_j = \\exists y_j \\bigwedge_{i \\in I_j} P_i(y_j)$ for $j=1, \\dots, m$.\n\nIn any given model $\\mathcal{M}$, each sentence $S_j$ is either true or false.\n*   If any sentence $S_j$ is false in $\\mathcal{M}$, the entire conjunction $\\phi(x)$ is false for any value of $x$. In this case, $\\phi(x)$ is equivalent to $\\bot$ and defines the empty set $\\emptyset$.\n*   If all sentences $S_1, \\dots, S_m$ are true in $\\mathcal{M}$, the formula $\\phi(x)$ is equivalent to the first part, $\\psi_0(x)$.\n\nThe formula $\\psi_0(x)$ is a conjunction of some subset of the base predicates applied to $x$. Let $A_i$ be the interpretation of $P_i$ (the set of elements for which $P_i$ is true). The set defined by $\\psi_0(x)$ is the intersection $\\bigcap_{i \\in I_0} A_i$. The special case where $I_0$ is empty corresponds to the formula $\\top$, which defines the entire universe $U$.\n\nSo, for any given model $\\mathcal{M}$, the set of definable concepts (the concept class $\\mathcal{C}_{\\mathcal{M}}$) is a subset of the class of all possible intersections of the base sets $\\{A_1, A_2, A_3, A_4\\}$.\nLet $\\mathcal{C}_{inter} = \\{ \\bigcap_{i \\in I} A_i \\mid I \\subseteq \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\} \\}$.\nWe have $\\mathcal{C}_{\\mathcal{M}} \\subseteq \\mathcal{C}_{inter}$. The VC dimension of the language is $\\sup_{\\mathcal{M}} \\mathrm{VC-dim}(\\mathcal{C}_{\\mathcal{M}})$.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the VC dimension (Upper Bound)\n\nThe VC dimension of the language is bounded by the VC dimension of the \"richest possible\" concept class, which is $\\mathcal{C}_{inter}$. Let's find the VC dimension of $\\mathcal{C}_{inter}$. This is a known result in learning theory.\n\n**Result**: The VC dimension of a concept class formed by all possible intersections of $k$ base sets is $k$.\n\nIn our case, we have $k=4$ base predicates, giving rise to 4 base sets $A_1, A_2, A_3, A_4$. Thus, the VC dimension of $\\mathcal{C}_{inter}$ is 4.\nSince for any model $\\mathcal{M}$, $\\mathcal{C}_{\\mathcal{M}} \\subseteq \\mathcal{C}_{inter}$, we have that $\\text{VC-dim}(\\mathcal{C}_{\\mathcal{M}}) \\le \\text{VC-dim}(\\mathcal{C}_{inter}) = 4$.\nTaking the supremum over all models, the VC dimension of the language is at most 4.\n\n### Step 4: Determine the VC dimension (Lower Bound)\n\nTo show that the VC dimension is at least 4, we need to show that there *exists* a set of 4 points that can be shattered. This involves constructing a specific model $\\mathcal{M}$.\n\nLet's choose a universe $U$ with 4 points: $X = \\{x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4\\}$.\nWe need to define the interpretations of the predicates $P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4$ (i.e., the sets $A_1, A_2, A_3, A_4$) in such a way that we can generate every subset of $X$.\n\nLet's define the base sets as follows:\n*   $A_1 = X \\setminus \\{x_1\\} = \\{x_2, x_3, x_4\\}$\n*   $A_2 = X \\setminus \\{x_2\\} = \\{x_1, x_3, x_4\\}$\n*   $A_3 = X \\setminus \\{x_3\\} = \\{x_1, x_2, x_4\\}$\n*   $A_4 = X \\setminus \\{x_4\\} = \\{x_1, x_2, x_3\\}$\n\nNow, let $Y$ be any arbitrary subset of $X$. We need to show that there is a formula $\\phi_Y(x)$ in our language that defines the set $Y$.\nConsider the concept formed by taking an intersection of our base sets. Let $I \\subseteq \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$ be an index set. The corresponding concept is $C_I = \\bigcap_{i \\in I} A_i$.\n$C_I = \\bigcap_{i \\in I} (X \\setminus \\{x_i\\}) = X \\setminus \\bigcup_{i \\in I} \\{x_i\\}$.\n\nTo obtain the specific subset $Y$, we need to choose the index set $I$ such that $X \\setminus \\bigcup_{i \\in I} \\{x_i\\} = Y$.\nThis is equivalent to $\\bigcup_{i \\in I} \\{x_i\\} = X \\setminus Y$.\nSo, we can simply choose the index set $I$ to be the set of indices of the elements *not* in $Y$. That is, let $I_Y = \\{j \\mid x_j \\in X \\setminus Y\\}$.\nWith this choice, the concept is $C_{I_Y} = \\bigcap_{j \\in I_Y} A_j = Y$.\n\nFor every subset $Y \\subseteq X$, the set $Y$ is equal to $\\bigcap_{j \\in I_Y} A_j$. This intersection is defined by the formula $\\phi_Y(x) = \\bigwedge_{j \\in I_Y} P_j(x)$. This formula is a simple conjunction of atomic predicates and is therefore in our language $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$.\n\nSince we can define every subset of the 4-element set $X$, we have shattered $X$.\nTherefore, the VC dimension of the language is at least 4.\n\n### Step 5: Final Conclusion\n\n*   From Step 3, we have VC-dim $\\le 4$.\n*   From Step 4, we have VC-dim $\\ge 4$.\n\nCombining these two bounds, the VC dimension of $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$ is exactly 4."
