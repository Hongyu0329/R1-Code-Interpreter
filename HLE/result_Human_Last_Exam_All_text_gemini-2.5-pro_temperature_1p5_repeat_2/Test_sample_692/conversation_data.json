    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the earliest known recorded date from a pre-Columbian civilization.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Question and Define Key Terms**\n\n*   **\"Earliest known date\"**: This refers to the oldest specific calendar date that has been discovered on an artifact, not the age of the civilization or the artifact itself.\n*   **\"Recorded\"**: The date must be physically inscribed or painted on an object using a recognized writing system.\n*   **\"Pre-Columbian civilization\"**: Any of the indigenous cultures of the Americas that existed before significant European influence began in 1492.\n*   **\"Aboriginal writing system\"**: A script developed by these indigenous cultures, such as Maya hieroglyphs, Zapotec script, or Isthmian (Epi-Olmec) script.\n\n### **Step 2: List Careful Points and Distinctions**\n\n1.  **Type of Calendar**: Mesoamerican civilizations used two main types of calendars. The **Calendar Round** was a 52-year cycle created by interlocking a 260-day sacred calendar and a 365-day solar calendar. A date in this system, like \"4 Ahau 8 Cumku,\" recurs every 52 years. The **Long Count** was an absolute calendar that counted the number of days elapsed since a mythical creation date (August 11, 3114 BCE). A Long Count date is specific and does not repeat for over 5,000 years, making it the most precise system for recording a specific point in history. The question is best answered by finding the earliest Long Count date.\n2.  **Oldest Writing vs. Oldest Date**: The oldest example of writing is not necessarily the oldest recorded date. For example, the **Cascajal Block**, an Olmec artifact dated to around 900 BCE, contains glyphs but they are not deciphered as a date.\n3.  **Oldest Calendrical Reference vs. Oldest Absolute Date**: The earliest known calendrical glyph is found on **Monument 3 at San Jos√© Mogote**, a Zapotec site in Oaxaca, Mexico. It bears the glyph \"1 Earthquake,\" a day name from the 260-day calendar. The monument is archaeologically dated to around **600 BCE**. However, this is a day name within a recurring cycle, not a complete, absolute date like a Long Count.\n4.  **Interpreted vs. Clear Dates**: Some dates are damaged and require archaeological interpretation, which can sometimes be debated. The most reliable candidates are those that are relatively clear and complete.\n\n### **Step 3: Acquire the Final Answer with Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  The search for the earliest specific, absolute date focuses on artifacts bearing a **Long Count** inscription, as this system provides a fixed point in time. The earliest Long Count dates found are not Maya, but belong to a precursor culture often identified as Epi-Olmec or Isthmian.\n\n2.  Several key artifacts have been candidates for the earliest Long Count date:\n    *   **Tres Zapotes Stela C (Veracruz, Mexico)**: This monument has a bar-and-dot number inscription that represents a Long Count date. Although the first digit (the *b'ak'tun*) was missing, it was reconstructed by archaeologist Matthew Stirling as '7'. This gives the date **7.16.6.16.18**, which correlates to **September 3, 32 BCE** in the Proleptic Gregorian calendar. For a long time, this was considered the oldest known date in the Americas.\n    *   **Tuxtla Statuette (Veracruz, Mexico)**: This small greenstone figurine has a clearer Long Count date of **8.6.2.4.17**, which correlates to **March 14, 162 CE**. This is significantly later than the date on Stela C.\n    *   **Chiapa de Corzo Stela 2 (Chiapas, Mexico)**: Discovered at the site of Chiapa de Corzo, this stone monument fragment contains the oldest widely accepted Long Count date found in its original location. The inscription reads **7.16.3.2.13**.\n\n3.  To determine which date is earliest, we correlate the Long Count to our calendar.\n    *   The Tres Zapotes date is **32 BCE**.\n    *   The Chiapa de Corzo date is **36 BCE**.\n\n4.  Comparing the two, 36 BCE is four years earlier than 32 BCE. Therefore, the date inscribed on Stela 2 from Chiapa de Corzo is the earliest known absolute date recorded in a pre-Columbian writing system.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nWhile older examples of calendrical glyphs exist (like the \"1 Earthquake\" glyph from ~600 BCE), the earliest *specific and absolute date* recorded is the Long Count date found on Chiapa de Corzo Stela 2.\n\n<<<The earliest known specific date recorded in a pre-Columbian writing system is **December 9, 36 BCE**. This date was inscribed using the Long Count calendar system on **Stela 2 from the site of Chiapa de Corzo**, in Chiapas, Mexico.>>>"
