    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the first winner of the Academy Award for Best Picture to depict a Luxor Obelisk on-screen.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Subject:** A film.\n    *   **Criterion 1:** It must have won the Academy Award for Best Picture.\n    *   **Criterion 2:** It must depict a \"Luxor Obelisk\" on-screen.\n    *   **Criterion 3:** It must be the *first* film to meet the other two criteria.\n\n2.  **Identify the \"Luxor Obelisk\":**\n    *   This is a crucial point. There are two famous Luxor Obelisks.\n        *   One stands at the entrance to the Luxor Temple in Luxor, Egypt.\n        *   The second, its twin, was transported to Paris, France, in the 1830s and now stands in the center of the Place de la Concorde.\n    *   A depiction of *either* of these obelisks on-screen would satisfy the question.\n\n3.  **Chronological Search Strategy:**\n    *   The most logical approach is to go through the list of Best Picture winners chronologically, starting from the first award (for the 1927/1928 film year), and analyze the setting and prominent scenes of each film. We are looking for the earliest winner set in either Paris or Luxor.\n\n4.  **Executing the Search and Analysis:**\n\n    *   **1920s and 1930s:**\n        *   Winners like *Wings* (1927/28), *The Broadway Melody* (1929), *All Quiet on the Western Front* (1930), and *Gone with the Wind* (1939) are set in locations like WWI battlefields, New York, and the American South. None are set in a way that would feature either obelisk.\n        *   *The Life of Emile Zola* (1937) is set in Paris. This makes it a potential candidate. However, a review of the film's major scenes (courtrooms, domestic interiors, Devil's Island) shows no prominent or clear depiction of the Place de la Concorde. While a fleeting background shot is possible, it is not a confirmed or notable feature of the film's cinematography.\n\n    *   **1940s:**\n        *   We continue chronologically past films like *Rebecca* (1940) and *How Green Was My Valley* (1941).\n        *   This brings us to **Casablanca**, which won Best Picture for 1943. While the main story is set in Morocco, the film contains an iconic and extended flashback sequence detailing Rick and Ilsa's romance in Paris before the German occupation.\n        *   **Careful Point:** During this Paris flashback montage, there is a distinct, albeit brief, shot of Rick and Ilsa in a car. In the background, the Place de la Concorde, with the Luxor Obelisk at its center, is clearly visible. This is a confirmed depiction.\n\n    *   **Confirming it is the \"First\":**\n        *   Since we've found a confirmed depiction in the 1943 winner, we must check if any earlier winner also has one. As established, *The Life of Emile Zola* (1937) is the only plausible earlier candidate, but a confirmed on-screen depiction is not evident. Therefore, *Casablanca* stands as the first verifiable instance.\n        *   To be thorough, let's look at later winners known for their Paris settings.\n            *   *An American in Paris* (1951) features many Parisian scenes, including a stylized depiction of the Place de la Concorde in its famous closing ballet. However, it won 8 years after *Casablanca*.\n            *   *Gigi* (1958) was also filmed in Paris and shows the obelisk, but this is also significantly later than *Casablanca*.\n        *   No Best Picture winner set in Egypt, such as *Lawrence of Arabia* (1962), features scenes in Luxor that show the original obelisk.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe chronological analysis points to a single film. While other winners show the obelisk, they all won the award *after* this film. The key is the famous Paris flashback sequence.\n\n*   The film is **Casablanca**.\n*   It won Best Picture for the year **1943**.\n*   It depicts the Luxor Obelisk located in the **Place de la Concorde, Paris**, during a flashback montage.\n*   No earlier Best Picture winner has a confirmed on-screen depiction of either Luxor Obelisk.\n\n<<<Casablanca>>>"
