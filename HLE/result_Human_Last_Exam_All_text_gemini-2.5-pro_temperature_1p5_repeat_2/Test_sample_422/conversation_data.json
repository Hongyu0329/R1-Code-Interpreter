    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Prompt's Core Components**\n\n*   **JTB Definition:** Knowledge is defined as a Justified True Belief (K = J + T + B). This means for a subject 'S' to know a proposition 'P', three conditions must be met:\n    1.  S believes P. (Belief)\n    2.  P is true. (Truth)\n    3.  S is justified in believing P. (Justification)\n*   **Constraint 1: Limited Epistemic States:** Our only available mental states concerning a proposition are \"Knowledge\" and \"Belief\". This simplifies the complex landscape of epistemology into a binary choice. This implies that for any proposition P, a person is either in a state of \"Knowing P\" or \"Believing P\".\n*   **Constraint 2: Ignore Gettier Problems:** We must disregard the classic counterexamples where a person has a justified true belief that intuitively does not seem to be knowledge. This forces us to find other, more fundamental issues with the JTB framework itself or its interaction with the given constraints.\n*   **Goal:** Identify two distinct problems that arise for the JTB definition under these specific conditions.\n\n**2. Analysis of the First Problem: The Infinite Regress of Justification**\n\n*   **Focus on the \"J\" (Justification):** The JTB theory states that for a belief to become knowledge, it must be justified. However, the theory itself does not define what counts as a valid justification. This leads to a critical question: What is the epistemic status of the justification itself?\n*   **The Regress:** Let's say you claim to know proposition P. According to JTB, you need a justification, let's call it J1.\n    *   For J1 to be a *good* justification, you must have some positive epistemic standing with respect to it. You can't base your knowledge on a justification you have no reason to think is true.\n    *   If we assume that to provide justification, you must *know* J1, then we must apply the JTB definition to J1 itself. To know J1, you must have a *justified* true belief in it. This requires a new justification, J2.\n    *   This reasoning can be applied again to J2, which requires a justification J3, and so on.\n*   **Conclusion for Problem 1:** This creates an endless chain of required justifications (P -> J1 -> J2 -> J3 -> ...). This is known as the **infinite regress problem**. The JTB definition requires justification but provides no \"stopping point\" or foundational belief that does not require further justification, thus failing to explain how any belief can be ultimately justified.\n\n**3. Analysis of the Second Problem: Contradiction in State Definitions**\n\n*   **Focus on the relationship between \"Knowledge\" and \"Belief\":** This problem arises from the direct conflict between the prompt's two constraints.\n*   **Analyzing the JTB relationship:** According to the JTB definition, \"Knowledge is a Justified True **Belief**\". This logically means that Knowledge is a *subset* of Belief. If you are in a state of Knowledge, you are necessarily also in a state of Belief. The set of all your \"beliefs\" includes all of your \"knowledge\".\n*   **Analyzing the constraint relationship:** The prompt states that the *only available epistemic states* are Knowledge and Belief. This phrasing sets them up as two distinct, mutually exclusive categories. In this simplified world, for any given proposition, your mental state is *either* Knowledge *or* Belief, but not both simultaneously. For instance, if you \"believe\" it will rain, it implies you do not \"know\" it will rain.\n*   **The Contradiction:** These two ideas are contradictory.\n    *   The JTB definition implies inclusivity: **Knowledge ⊂ Belief**.\n    *   The prompt's constraint implies exclusivity: **Mental State ∈ {Knowledge, Belief}**, where `Knowledge ∩ Belief = ø`.\n*   **Conclusion for Problem 2:** You cannot simultaneously hold that Knowledge is a type of Belief and that Knowledge and Belief are the only two mutually exclusive epistemic states available. The JTB framework is fundamentally incompatible with the simplified two-state world proposed in the question.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe two problems are:\n1.  **The Infinite Regress of Justification:** The JTB model requires justification for knowledge, but for that justification to be valid, it must also be known (or at least justified). This leads to an endless chain of required justifications, which the model provides no mechanism to stop.\n2.  **A Logical Contradiction between the States:** The JTB definition posits that knowledge is a *type* of belief (inclusive). However, the constraint that Knowledge and Belief are the only two available epistemic states implies they are separate and mutually exclusive categories. These two views are contradictory.\n\n<<<The two problems are the infinite regress of justification and the logical contradiction between the JTB model (where knowledge is a subset of belief) and the premise that knowledge and belief are the two distinct, mutually exclusive epistemic states.>>>"
