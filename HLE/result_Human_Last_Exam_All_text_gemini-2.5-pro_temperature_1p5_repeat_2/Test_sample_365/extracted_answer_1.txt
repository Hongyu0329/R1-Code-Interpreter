The product is a tricyclic ether resulting from an intramolecular cyclization. The oxygen from the alcohol at C2 attacks the C6 carbon of the double bond, forming a C2-O-C6 ether bridge. The C5-C6 double bond is saturated during this process after protonation at C5 in the workup. The 7,7-dimethoxy group and the (S)-4-((tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy)cyclopent-1-en-1-yl substituent remain unchanged. The original stereochemistry of the molecule is retained.
