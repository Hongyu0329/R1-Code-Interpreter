    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of power subgroups in the semidihedral group of size 512.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Group Structure\n\nThe group in question is the semidihedral group of order 512. The semidihedral group of order $2^n$ (for $n \\ge 4$) is denoted $SD_{2^n}$.\nIn our case, the order is $512 = 2^9$, so we have $n=9$. The group is $SD_{512}$.\n\nA standard presentation for $SD_{2^n}$ is:\n$SD_{2^n} = \\langle r, s \\mid r^{2^{n-1}} = s^2 = 1, srs = r^{2^{n-2}-1} \\rangle$\n\nFor $n=9$, this becomes:\n$SD_{512} = \\langle r, s \\mid r^{256} = s^2 = 1, srs = r^{127} \\rangle$\n\nThe group has 512 elements, which can be divided into two sets:\n1.  The elements of the form $r^i$ for $i \\in \\{0, 1, ..., 255\\}$. These form a cyclic subgroup $\\langle r \\rangle$ of order 256. This is a normal subgroup of index 2.\n2.  The elements of the form $sr^i$ for $i \\in \\{0, 1, ..., 255\\}$. There are 256 such elements, forming the other coset of $\\langle r \\rangle$.\n\n### Step 2: Understand the Question\n\nThe question asks for the number of \"power subgroups\". A power subgroup is a subgroup generated by a single element. In group theory terminology, this is simply a **cyclic subgroup**.\nSo, the problem is to find the total number of distinct cyclic subgroups in $SD_{512}$.\n\n### Step 3: Strategy for Counting Subgroups\n\nWe will count the number of cyclic subgroups by partitioning them into two categories:\n1.  Cyclic subgroups that are entirely contained within the subgroup $\\langle r \\rangle$.\n2.  Cyclic subgroups that are not contained within $\\langle r \\rangle$. These must be generated by an element of the form $sr^i$.\n\n### Step 4: Counting Cyclic Subgroups within $\\langle r \\rangle$\n\nThe subgroup $\\langle r \\rangle$ is a cyclic group of order 256. For any cyclic group $C_m$, the number of subgroups is equal to the number of divisors of its order $m$, denoted $\\tau(m)$. Each of these subgroups is also cyclic.\n*   Order of $\\langle r \\rangle$ is $m = 256 = 2^8$.\n*   The number of divisors is $\\tau(256) = \\tau(2^8) = 8+1=9$.\n*   These 9 subgroups are of orders 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, and 256.\n\nSo, there are **9** cyclic subgroups contained in $\\langle r \\rangle$.\n\n### Step 5: Counting Cyclic Subgroups outside of $\\langle r \\rangle$\n\nThese subgroups must be generated by elements of the form $g = sr^i$. To count these, we first need to determine the orders of these elements.\nThe order of $g$ is found by computing powers of $g$:\n$g^2 = (sr^i)^2 = sr^i s r^i$.\nUsing the relation $srs = r^{127}$, we can find a general rule for conjugation: $sr^is = (srs)^i = (r^{127})^i = r^{127i}$.\nSo, $g^2 = (sr^is)r^i = r^{127i}r^i = r^{128i}$.\n\nThe order of $g^2=r^{128i}$ within the group $\\langle r \\rangle$ (of order 256) is $\\frac{256}{\\text{gcd}(256, 128i)} = \\frac{256}{128 \\cdot \\text{gcd}(2, i)} = \\frac{2}{\\text{gcd}(2, i)}$.\n\nWe have two cases for the integer $i$:\n*   **Case A: $i$ is even.** Let $i=2k$.\n    $\\text{gcd}(2, i) = 2$. The order of $g^2 = r^{128i}$ is $\\frac{2}{2}=1$.\n    This means $(sr^{2k})^2 = e$ (the identity element).\n    So, elements $sr^i$ with $i$ even have order 2.\n    There are 128 even numbers in $\\{0, 1, ..., 255\\}$ (namely $0, 2, ..., 254$). Each of these 128 elements generates a distinct cyclic subgroup of order 2. For example, $\\langle sr^2 \\rangle=\\{e, sr^2\\}$ is different from $\\langle sr^4 \\rangle=\\{e, sr^4\\}$. None of these subgroups are the same as the order 2 subgroup in $\\langle r \\rangle$, which is $\\langle r^{128} \\rangle$.\n    This gives **128** new cyclic subgroups.\n\n*   **Case B: $i$ is odd.** Let $i=2k+1$.\n    $\\text{gcd}(2, i) = 1$. The order of $g^2 = r^{128i}$ is $\\frac{2}{1}=2$.\n    This means $(sr^i)^2 = r^{128}$ (since $i$ is odd, $r^{128i}=(r^{128})^i=r^{128}$).\n    Since $(sr^i)^2$ is an element of order 2, $(sr^i)^4 = ((sr^i)^2)^2 = (r^{128})^2 = r^{256} = e$.\n    So, elements $sr^i$ with $i$ odd have order 4.\n    There are 128 odd numbers in $\\{0, 1, ..., 255\\}$ (namely $1, 3, ..., 255$). So there are 128 elements of order 4.\n    A cyclic group of order 4 has $\\phi(4)=2$ generators (where $\\phi$ is Euler's totient function). This means two distinct elements generate the same subgroup.\n    If $g = sr^i$ is a generator, the other generator is $g^3$.\n    $g^3 = g^2 \\cdot g = r^{128} \\cdot sr^i$. This does not look helpful. Let's use another form:\n    $g^3 = (sr^i)^3 = sr^i(sr^i)^2 = sr^i r^{128} = s(r^i r^{128}) = sr^{i+128}$.\n    So, $\\langle sr^i \\rangle = \\langle sr^{i+128} \\rangle$ for odd $i$.\n    The 128 elements of order 4 form pairs, with each pair generating a single subgroup.\n    The number of distinct cyclic subgroups is therefore $128 / 2 = 64$.\n    These subgroups are distinct from the cyclic subgroup of order 4 in $\\langle r \\rangle$, which is $\\langle r^{64} \\rangle$.\n    This gives **64** new cyclic subgroups.\n\n### Step 6: Final Calculation\n\nTo find the total number of power subgroups (cyclic subgroups), we sum the counts from each part.\n*   Cyclic subgroups from $\\langle r \\rangle$: 9\n*   Cyclic subgroups of order 2 from outside $\\langle r \\rangle$: 128\n*   Cyclic subgroups of order 4 from outside $\\langle r \\rangle$: 64\n\nTotal number = $9 + 128 + 64 = 201$.\n\n---\n**Summary of Careful Points:**\n*   Correctly identified the group as $SD_{512}$ with $n=9$.\n*   Recognized \"power subgroup\" as a synonym for \"cyclic subgroup\".\n*   Correctly calculated the orders of elements of the form $sr^i$. The key relation is $(sr^i)^2 = r^{128i}$.\n*   Accounted for multiple generators for the same subgroup (specifically for the order 4 subgroups where $\\phi(4)=2$).\n*   Ensured there was no double-counting between subgroups contained in $\\langle r \\rangle$ and those not contained in it.\n\nThe analysis provides a complete and verified count.\n\n<<<201>>>"
