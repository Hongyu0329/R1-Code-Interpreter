**1) Hotspots for Interaction with the alpha-1 subunit:**

The primary interaction hotspots are residues within the Guanylate Kinase (GK) domain of the human beta-1 subunit (CaVβ1, UniProt: P54289) that form a hydrophobic binding pocket for the Alpha Interaction Domain (AID) of the alpha-1 subunit. Key residues include:
*   **Y368 (Tyrosine at position 368)**
*   **V370 (Valine at position 370)**
*   **L399 (Leucine at position 399)**
*   **V401 (Valine at position 401)**
*   **Y413 (Tyrosine at position 413)**
*   **F445 (Phenylalanine at position 445)**

Additionally, a crucial residue for stabilizing the entire binding-competent structure is:
*   **W391 (Tryptophan at position 391)** located in the HOOK region.

**2) Hotspots for Gating Modulation of the alpha-1 subunit:**

Gating modulation is an allosteric effect mediated by several regions of the CaVβ1 subunit.
*   **The N-terminal Domain (approximately residues 1-75):** This entire region is a functional hotspot, particularly for controlling the rate of channel inactivation. Its presence accelerates inactivation, a hallmark of β1b modulation.
*   **W391 (Tryptophan at position 391):** This residue is a critical hotspot for modulation because its role in maintaining the structural integrity of the GK domain is a prerequisite for any functional effect on gating.
*   **The SH3 Domain (approximately residues 279-340):** The entire domain acts as a unit to ensure the correct conformation and allosteric communication needed for modulation, rather than having single, standout hotspot residues.
