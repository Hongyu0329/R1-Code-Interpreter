    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Source Text:** A Russian translation of an essay (or, more likely, an essay written in Russian).\n    *   **Subject Matter:** The description of the wide boulevards of Vienna.\n    *   **Key Detail:** The surname of an English poet appears in this description.\n    *   **Objective:** Name this surname in English.\n\n2.  **List of Careful Points:**\n    *   **The Russian Context:** The fact that the text is in Russian is a critical clue. This suggests the connection may be a pun, an idiom, or a cultural reference specific to the Russian language or literary circles.\n    *   **The \"English Poet\" Definition:** \"English poet\" does not strictly mean a poet from England. It can be interpreted more broadly as a poet who wrote a significant body of work in the English language, regardless of their origin. This is a common and crucial point of ambiguity in such questions.\n    *   **\"Wide Boulevards of Vienna\":** This likely refers to Vienna's most famous boulevard, the Ringstrasse, which is known for its grandeur and width. The key descriptor is \"wide.\"\n    *   **The Nature of the Connection:** It is highly unlikely that a Viennese boulevard is literally named after an English poet. The connection must be metaphorical or a form of wordplay.\n\n3.  **Acquiring the Answer with Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n    *   **Step 1: Explore the wordplay.** Let's focus on the descriptor \"wide.\" In English, a synonym for \"wide\" is \"broad.\" We should look for a poet whose surname sounds like \"broad.\"\n\n    *   **Step 2: Identify a potential candidate.** The Russian-American poet Joseph Brodsky fits the criteria perfectly.\n        *   Is he an \"English poet\"? Although born in Russia, Brodsky was exiled, became a US citizen, served as the US Poet Laureate, and wrote many of his celebrated essays and later poems in English, winning the Nobel Prize in Literature. He is widely considered a master of the English language, thus fitting the broader definition of an \"English poet.\"\n        *   Does his surname connect to \"wide\"? The surname \"Brodsky\" bears a strong phonetic resemblance to the English word \"broad.\"\n\n    *   **Step 3: Find the source text.** The specific reference comes from the popular book of essays \"Гений места\" (\"Genius of the Place\") by Russian writers Pyotr Vail and Alexander Genis. Pyotr Vail was a personal friend of Joseph Brodsky.\n\n    *   **Step 4: Confirm the connection.** In the chapter on Vienna, Vail describes the magnificent wide avenues. He creates a pun by referring to a \"широкий проспект\" (shirokiy prospekt, or \"wide avenue\") as a \"Бродский проспект\" (Brodsky prospekt). This clever wordplay directly links the width of Vienna's boulevards to his friend's surname.\n\n    *   **Step 5: Synthesize the findings.** All the clues in the question point to Joseph Brodsky. The text is a Russian essay, the setting is Vienna's wide boulevards, and the surname of a poet who wrote in English (Brodsky) is used as a pun on the word \"broad\" (wide).\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on this analysis, the surname of the English poet is Brodsky.\n\n<<<Brodsky>>>"
