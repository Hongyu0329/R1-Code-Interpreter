Yes. Based on the Generality Constraint and its implications for what it means to possess a concept, having the concepts for `Fa` and for universal quantification `∀` is sufficient to understand `∀x Fx`. Understanding `Fa` implies you possess the general, recombinable concept `F`. Understanding `∀` implies you have the systematic ability to apply it to any predicate concept you possess. Therefore, you must be able to apply the `∀` operation to the `F` concept to understand the proposition `∀x Fx`.
