    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the character in William Morris's *The House of the Wolfings* who describes Roman religious practices in a way that refers to Romulus and Remus.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Book:** *The House of the Wolfings* by William Morris.\n    *   **Action:** A character visited a Roman city.\n    *   **Description:** The character describes Roman religious practices.\n    *   **Key Detail:** The description is a clear allusion to the legend of Romulus and Remus (suckled by a wolf, founding a city).\n    *   **Goal:** Identify the name of this character.\n\n2.  **Examine the Characters and Context:**\n    *   The novel is set among a tribe of Goths (the Wolfings) who are preparing to battle the invading Roman legions. The primary conflict is between the Germanic tribal culture and the Roman Empire.\n    *   **Thiodolf:** The War-Duke of the Wolfings. His knowledge of Romans is primarily military. He is focused on defending his people.\n    *   **The Hall-Sun:** A supernatural being, a valkyrie-like figure, who is the lover/wife of Thiodolf. Her origins and knowledge are tied to the gods and the history of the Goths, not to Roman cities.\n    *   **Otter:** A thrall (a slave or captive) who serves the Wolfings. He was not born a Wolfing and is described as having traveled more widely and seen more of the world than the more isolated tribesmen. This background makes him the most likely candidate to possess detailed knowledge of Roman customs from personal experience.\n\n3.  **Locate the Relevant Scene in the Novel:**\n    *   In Chapter VI, titled \"Otter tells of the Romans,\" the men of the Wolfings are discussing the nature of their enemy. They know the Romans are powerful but have little understanding of their culture or beliefs.\n    *   Otter, the thrall, speaks up to share what he has seen and heard. He is established as a source of outside intelligence.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Character's Description:**\n    *   Otter recounts what he learned while he was a captive in a Roman-ruled area.\n    *   He describes the Romans' origin story. He says that the Romans believe their \"first fathers\" were \"two brethren\" who were cast out as infants into the wilderness.\n    *   He explicitly states that these two brethren were \"suckled by a she-wolf\" and that the wolf is therefore a sacred animal to the Romans.\n    *   He mentions that in their city, there is a famous image \"wrought in brass\" depicting \"the wolf and the two children sucking her.\"\n    *   **Careful Point:** This description is an unmistakable reference to the Roman foundation myth of Romulus and Remus being nursed by the she-wolf, an image immortalized in the famous Capitoline Wolf (Lupa Capitolina) statue. Otter's account is designed to be recognized immediately by the reader, even if the Gothic characters are bewildered by it.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   Based on the textual evidence in Chapter VI, the character who has been to a Roman-controlled city and describes their religious origins in a way that refers to Romulus and Remus is the thrall, Otter.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe character who provides this description is **Otter**.\n\n<<<Otter>>>"
