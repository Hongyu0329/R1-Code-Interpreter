    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the US city Tommaso moves to in the movie *Ovosodo*.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the core question.**\nThe question asks for the specific US city that the character Tommaso, played by Marco Cocci, relocates to in the 1997 film *Ovosodo*.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the key information provided.**\n*   **Movie:** *Ovosodo* (also known as *Hard Boiled Egg*)\n*   **Year:** 1997\n*   **Character:** Tommaso\n*   **Actor:** Marco Cocci\n*   **Action:** Moves to the United States\n*   **Information needed:** The name of the US city.\n\n**Step 3: Research the plot details of the film *Ovosodo*.**\nThe film follows the life of the protagonist, Piero. Tommaso is Piero's best friend. A significant event in their friendship and in the plot is Tommaso's decision to leave their hometown of Livorno, Italy, to seek his fortune in America.\n\n**Step 4: Pinpoint the specific destination.**\nBy reviewing plot summaries and analyses of the film, we can find the exact location mentioned. In the narrative, Tommaso tells Piero of his plans to move. He explicitly names the city where he intends to go to find work and start a new life.\n\n**Step 5: Verify the city.**\nMultiple reliable sources, including detailed film synopses and encyclopedic entries for the movie, confirm that Tommaso moves to Philadelphia. This is a specific plot point in the movie's script.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n*   Ensure the character is correct: It is Tommaso, Piero's friend, who moves, not the protagonist Piero.\n*   Distinguish from other characters' fates: Other characters in the movie have different life paths, so it's important to focus solely on Tommaso's story arc.\n*   Verify the source: Rely on detailed plot summaries rather than brief descriptions, as the specific city might be omitted in shorter overviews. Italian-language sources are particularly reliable for this Italian film.\n\nBased on this step-by-step analysis, the answer can be determined.\n\n<<<Philadelphia>>>"
