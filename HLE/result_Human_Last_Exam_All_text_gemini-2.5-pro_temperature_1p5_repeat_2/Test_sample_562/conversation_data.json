    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the radical of the character 謄.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the Character's Structure:**\n    The Japanese character is 謄. At first glance, it can be visually broken down into two parts:\n    *   The left side: 月\n    *   The right side: 朕\n    Based on this visual breakdown, one might assume the radical is the left-side component, 月.\n\n2.  **Identify the Radical (Bushu):**\n    While the left-side component 月 (tsuki) is a common radical (known as *tsukihen* or *nikuzuki*), this is a misleading case. In the official system for classifying kanji, which is often based on historical and etymological origins rather than just modern appearance, the radical is not always the most obvious visual component.\n    The meaning of 謄 is \"to copy\" or \"to transcribe,\" which is related to writing and words. Due to this connection in meaning, authoritative dictionaries (including those based on the traditional Kangxi radical system) classify 謄 under the radical 言 (\"word, to say\").\n    The right-hand side, 朕, functions as the phonetic component, indicating the sound *tō* or *chō*. The 月 on the left is considered part of this phonetic component, not the primary radical for classification.\n\n3.  **Determine the Name of the Radical:**\n    The radical is 言. In Japanese, radicals are given specific names, which can vary depending on their position in a character.\n    *   The radical 言, when it appears on the left side of a character (its most common position), is called ごんべん (*gonben*). Examples: 話, 語, 説.\n    *   Although the radical 言 is not clearly visible as a separate component in 謄, the character is classified under this radical family. The conventional name for the radical 言 is used.\n\n4.  **Convert the Name to Hepburn Romanization:**\n    The Japanese name for the radical is ごんべん. Following the Hepburn romanization system:\n    *   ご -> go\n    *   ん -> n\n    *   べ -> be\n    *   ん -> n\n    The complete romanization is **Gonben**.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Visual vs. Official Radical:** This is a key point of caution. The most obvious visual component of a kanji is not always its official radical. Classification can be based on meaning and etymology.\n*   **Radical Names:** The name of a radical can change with its position (e.g., -hen for left, -tsukuri for right, -kanmuri for top). However, the most common form's name (like \"-hen\" names) is often used as the general name for the radical.\n*   **Etymology over Appearance:** For complex or non-obvious characters, relying on a dictionary is crucial to confirm the correct radical, as the historical reason for its classification might not be apparent from the modern form. In this case, 謄's meaning points directly to the correct radical family of 言.\n\nBy following these steps, we can conclude that the official radical of 謄 is 言, and its name in Hepburn romanization is \"Gonben\".\n\n<<<Gonben>>>"
