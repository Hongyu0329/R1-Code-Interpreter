    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the symmetry group of the optimal packing of 1135 congruent circles in a circle.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Problem:** The question asks for the symmetry group of the most efficient (optimal) way to pack 1135 identical circles inside a larger containing circle. The final answer needs to be expressed using Schoenflies notation, which is a standard notation for point groups in chemistry and physics.\n\n2.  **Nature of the \"Circle Packing in a Circle\" Problem:** This is a famous and surprisingly difficult problem in mathematics.\n    *   **Optimality:** An arrangement is \"optimal\" if it maximizes the radius of the small circles for a fixed radius of the large containing circle. This is equivalent to minimizing the radius of the containing circle for a fixed radius of the small circles.\n    *   **Proven vs. Conjectured Solutions:** Optimal solutions have been mathematically proven only for a very small number of circles (N). For larger N, such as N=1135, the known \"optimal\" packings are actually \"best-known\" packings. They are strong conjectures based on extensive computational searches and numerical optimization, but they lack formal proof. For the purpose of answering this question, we will assume the best-known packing is the optimal one.\n\n3.  **Consulting a Reference:** To find the configuration for N=1135, we must consult a specialized database that collects the results of these computational searches. The most authoritative and comprehensive public resource is the \"packomania\" website by Eckard Specht, which documents the best-known packings for a wide range of N.\n\n4.  **Finding the Packing for N = 1135:** By looking up N=1135 in a reliable circle packing database (like packomania), we can find the properties of the best-known arrangement. This packing was found computationally and its properties are recorded.\n\n5.  **Identifying the Symmetry Group:** The key property we are looking for is the symmetry of the arrangement. The database records the symmetry group for each packing. For N=1135, the best-known packing is reported to have **D1** symmetry.\n\n6.  **Interpreting Schoenflies Notation:** The question requires the answer in Schoenflies notation. Let's analyze what D1 means in this context.\n    *   **C_n:** Represents a cyclic group with an n-fold rotation axis. For example, C3 has 3-fold rotational symmetry.\n    *   **D_n:** Represents a dihedral group. This group has all the symmetry operations of C_n, plus n two-fold rotation axes perpendicular to the principal n-fold axis. In a 2D context, this corresponds to an n-fold rotation axis and n mirror planes of reflection that pass through the center of the figure.\n    *   **D1:** Applying this to our case, D1 symmetry means the figure has a 1-fold rotational axis (which is the identity operation, as a 360Â° rotation leaves any object unchanged) and **one mirror plane**. An object with D1 symmetry has a single line of reflection, also known as bilateral symmetry.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** Based on the established computational results for the best-known packing of 1135 circles, the arrangement exhibits bilateral symmetry. In Schoenflies notation, this symmetry is denoted as D1.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   The solution is based on a conjectured, not a mathematically proven, optimal packing. However, it is the standard and accepted answer based on the current state of knowledge.\n*   It is crucial to rely on an authoritative source for the packing data, as many numbers have complex and non-intuitive arrangements.\n*   Understanding the Schoenflies notation (D_n vs. C_n) is key to providing the correct answer format. D1 precisely describes a single axis of reflection symmetry.\n\nAfter this step-by-step analysis, we have determined that the symmetry group for the optimal packing of 1135 circles in a circle is D1.\n\n<<<D1>>>"
