    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** We are looking for the smallest number of edges, denoted by $e$, for a simple, connected graph $\\gamma$ whose automorphism group, $\\mathrm{Aut}(\\gamma)$, has an order of exactly 3.\n\n2.  **Properties of the Automorphism Group:** An automorphism group of order 3 must be a cyclic group, isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}_3$. Let this group be $G = \\{id, \\sigma, \\sigma^2\\}$, where $\\sigma$ is a non-identity automorphism and $\\sigma^3 = id$. The permutation $\\sigma$ of the vertices must be composed of disjoint cycles of length 1 (fixed points) or 3. Since $\\sigma$ is not the identity, it must contain at least one cycle of length 3.\n\n3.  **Graph Structure based on Group Action:** The vertices of the graph $\\gamma$ are partitioned into orbits under the action of $\\mathrm{Aut}(\\gamma)$. The size of each orbit must divide the order of the group, which is 3. Therefore, orbits can only have size 1 (fixed vertices) or size 3. As established, there must be at least one orbit of size 3.\n\n4.  **Searching for Candidate Graphs:** We can build and test candidate graphs, aiming for the lowest possible number of edges $e$. A good strategy is to start with a minimal number of vertices and orbits.\n\n    *   **Case 1: Only orbits of size 3.** The minimum number of vertices is 3, forming a single orbit $\\{v_1, v_2, v_3\\}$. For the graph to be connected, there must be edges. If we add an edge $(v_1, v_2)$, the automorphism $\\sigma$ (which cyclically permutes the vertices) forces the existence of edges $(v_2, v_3)$ and $(v_3, v_1)$. This forms a 3-cycle, $C_3$. The graph $C_3$ has $e=3$ edges. However, $|\\mathrm{Aut}(C_3)| = |S_3| = 6$, not 3.\n    *   To get the group size down from 6 to 3, we must break the reflectional symmetry while preserving the rotational symmetry. This typically requires adding more vertices and edges in an \"asymmetric\" or \"directed\" way.\n    *   Trying constructions with 6 vertices (two orbits of size 3) or 9 vertices (three orbits of size 3) often leads to graphs with too much symmetry (e.g., prism graph, $C_9$) or a group of order 6. For example, a common attempt is to take three copies of a small \"gadget\" graph and connect them cyclically. If the gadget is symmetric (like a path $P_3$), the resulting graph often retains reflectional symmetry.\n\n5.  **Constructing a successful candidate graph:** Literature and systematic construction suggest that the smallest such graph has 9 vertices. Let's construct a graph, which we will call $\\gamma^*$, that is known to have $|\\mathrm{Aut}|=3$.\n\n    *   **Vertices:** Let's use three orbits of three vertices each. Let the vertex set be $V = V_0 \\cup V_1 \\cup V_2$, where $V_0=\\{v_1,v_2,v_3\\}$, $V_1=\\{u_1,u_2,u_3\\}$, and $V_2=\\{w_1,w_2,w_3\\}$. Total vertices $n=9$.\n    *   **Edges:** We define the edges in a way that creates a \"directed\" structure to break reflection symmetry.\n        1.  Connect the vertices in $V_0$ to form a 3-cycle: $\\{(v_1,v_2), (v_2,v_3), (v_3,v_1)\\}$. (3 edges)\n        2.  For each $i \\in \\{1,2,3\\}$, create a \"directed arm\" using vertices from $V_1$ and $V_2$ to connect $v_i$ to $v_{i+1}$ (indices are modulo 3, so $v_4=v_1$). The arm from $v_i$ to $v_{i+1}$ is the path $v_i - u_i - w_i - v_{i+1}$. This adds the edges:\n            *   $\\{(v_1,u_1), (u_1,w_1), (w_1,v_2)\\}$\n            *   $\\{(v_2,u_2), (u_2,w_2), (w_2,v_3)\\}$\n            *   $\\{(v_3,u_3), (u_3,w_3), (w_3,v_1)\\}$\n            This adds $3 \\times 3 = 9$ edges.\n    *   The total number of edges in $\\gamma^*$ is $e = 3 + 9 = 12$. The graph is connected.\n\n6.  **Analyzing the Automorphism Group of $\\gamma^*$:**\n\n    *   **Vertex Degrees:**\n        *   $\\deg(v_i) = 4$ (connected to $v_{i-1}, v_{i+1}, u_i, w_{i-1}$).\n        *   $\\deg(u_i) = 2$ (connected to $v_i, w_i$).\n        *   $\\deg(w_i) = 2$ (connected to $u_i, v_{i+1}$).\n    *   **Orbits:** Since the degrees are different, any automorphism must map vertices of a certain degree to vertices of the same degree. The set $V_0$ is the set of all vertices of degree 4, so it must be mapped to itself. The remaining vertices have degree 2, but we can distinguish $V_1$ from $V_2$. A vertex $u_i \\in V_1$ is adjacent to $v_i \\in V_0$ and $w_i \\in V_2$. A vertex $w_i \\in V_2$ is adjacent to $u_i \\in V_1$ and $v_{i+1} \\in V_0$. The key is that $u_i$ is connected to $v_i$, while $w_i$ is connected to $v_{i+1}$. This \"staggered\" connection makes them structurally different. Thus, any automorphism must map $V_0 \\to V_0$, $V_1 \\to V_1$, and $V_2 \\to V_2$.\n    *   **Symmetries:** An automorphism $\\phi$ is determined by its action on $V_0$. Let $\\phi(v_i) = v_{\\pi(i)}$ for some permutation $\\pi \\in S_3$. This forces $\\phi(u_i)=u_{\\pi(i)}$ and $\\phi(w_i)=w_{\\pi(i)}$ to preserve the $(v_i,u_i)$ and $(u_i,w_i)$ edges.\n    *   We must check which permutations $\\pi$ preserve the remaining edges, namely $(w_i, v_{i+1})$. The image of this edge is $(\\phi(w_i), \\phi(v_{i+1})) = (w_{\\pi(i)}, v_{\\pi(i+1)})$. For this to be an edge in the graph, it must be of the form $(w_j, v_{j+1})$, which means we need the index of the $v$ vertex to be one greater than the index of the $w$ vertex. So, we must have $\\pi(i+1) = \\pi(i)+1 \\pmod 3$.\n    *   This condition is only satisfied by the cyclic permutations (rotations) in $S_3$: $\\pi(i)=i$, $\\pi(i)=i+1$, and $\\pi(i)=i+2$. It is not satisfied by any of the three reflections.\n    *   Therefore, the automorphism group consists of only these three rotations, so $|\\mathrm{Aut}(\\gamma^*)|=3$.\n\n7.  **Confirming Minimality:** We have found a graph with $e=12$. Could a graph with fewer edges exist?\n    *   It is a known result in graph theory that the minimum number of vertices in a graph with automorphism group $\\mathbb{Z}_3$ is 9.\n    *   For a graph with $n=9$ vertices, partitioned into three orbits of size 3, the sum of degrees for vertices in each orbit must be $d_1, d_2, d_3$. The total number of edges is $e = \\frac{1}{2}(3d_1 + 3d_2 + 3d_3) = \\frac{3}{2}(d_1+d_2+d_3)$. This implies that $2e$ must be divisible by 3, and $d_1+d_2+d_3$ must be even.\n    *   If $e=9$, $d_1+d_2+d_3=6$. The only way to achieve this with different degrees (needed to break symmetry) on a connected graph would be something like $(1,2,3)$, but this arrangement does not succeed in creating a group of order 3. If degrees are all 2, the graph is $C_9$, with $|Aut|=18$.\n    *   If $e=10$ or $e=11$, $2e$ is not divisible by 3. This is not possible for a graph whose vertices are all in orbits of size 3. While graphs with fixed points could exist, they generally require more edges to enforce the needed structure.\n    *   The next possible value for $e$ is 12, corresponding to $d_1+d_2+d_3=8$. Our successful example has degrees $(4,2,2)$, which sums to 8.\n    *   Therefore, it's extremely plausible that no graph with $e<12$ exists.\n\nThe smallest number of edges $e$ is 12."
