**1. Specific Management Procedures:**
*   **Phase I (Emergency):** Urgent medical referral for uncontrolled diabetes. Local wound care including debridement, irrigation, and suturing of sockets. Administration of antibiotics and tetanus prophylaxis. Replantation is contraindicated.
*   **Phase II (Stabilization):** Monitor healing, wait for stabilization of her diabetes (target HbA1c < 7.0%), and provide a temporary removable acrylic prosthesis ("flipper") for aesthetics.
*   **Phase III (Definitive):** After medical clearance and tissue healing, a comprehensive evaluation is done. The most appropriate definitive treatment is a Cast Metal Framework Removable Partial Denture (RPD). Other options like a fixed bridge or implants carry higher risks and complexity in this specific case.

**2. Cells of Interest:**
The key cells are **Osteoblasts** and **Osteoclasts** (for bone healing), **Fibroblasts** (for soft tissue healing), and immune cells like **Neutrophils** and **Macrophages**. The function of all these cells is impaired by uncontrolled diabetes, increasing the risk of infection and poor healing. The **Periodontal Ligament (PDL) cells** on the lost teeth are also of interest as their death precludes replantation.

**3. Denture Replacement Details:**
*   **Type of Denture:** A **Cast Metal Framework Removable Partial Denture (RPD)**.
*   **Material:** The framework would be made of **Cobalt-Chromium alloy**, with saddles and teeth made from **acrylic resin**.
*   **Abutment Teeth and Reasons:**
    *   **Primary Abutments:** The **maxillary left second premolar** and the **maxillary left central incisor**. These teeth are directly adjacent to the edentulous space and will provide the primary support and retention for the denture.
    *   **Stabilizing Abutments:** The **maxillary right canine and a maxillary right premolar**. The denture framework will extend to the contralateral side to engage these teeth for cross-arch stabilization, which is essential to prevent rotational forces and ensure the stability and longevity of the prosthesis.
