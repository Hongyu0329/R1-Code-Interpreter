    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the historical linguistic developments from the given Proto-Indo-European form to the various Germanic languages.\n\n### **Step 1: Analysis of the Proto-Indo-European (PIE) Form**\n\n*   **PIE Form:** `*seh₂gieti`\n*   **Root:** `*seh₂g-` ('to track, perceive keenly, seek out'). The `*h₂` is a laryngeal consonant which colors the adjacent `*e` vowel towards an 'a' quality.\n*   **Suffix:** `*-ie-` This is a verbal suffix, often forming causative or stative verbs.\n*   **Ending:** `*-ti` This is the standard 3rd person singular present indicative ending.\n*   **Meaning:** '(s)he’s giving a sign, causing to perceive'.\n*   **Cognates:** The provided cognates `Hitt. sākizzi` ('gives a sign') and `Lat. sāgīre` ('to be keen-nosed, perceive keenly') confirm the root form `*seh₂g-` and its meaning. The long `ā` in Latin `sāgīre` is the expected reflex of PIE `*eh₂`.\n\n### **Step 2: Derivation of the Proto-Germanic (PGmc) Form**\n\nTo get from PIE to Proto-Germanic, we must apply a series of regular sound changes.\n\n1.  **Grimm's Law:** This is the most famous sound shift affecting consonants. The PIE voiced stop `*g` becomes the PGmc voiceless stop `*k`.\n    *   `*seh₂g-` → `*seh₂k-` (intermediate step)\n2.  **Laryngeal > Vowel Shift:** The laryngeal `*h₂` is lost, but it first merges with the preceding `*e` to become a long vowel, PGmc `*ā`.\n    *   `*seh₂k-` → `*sāk-`\n3.  **Verbal Class:** The PIE `*-ie-` suffix verbs become Class 1 weak verbs in Proto-Germanic. The infinitive form for these verbs ends in `*-janą`.\n4.  **Final Synthesis:** Combining the root `*sāk-` with the infinitive suffix `*-janą` gives us the Proto-Germanic form.\n\n*   **Proto-Germanic Result:** **\\*sākijaną**\n\n*A Note on Ablaut:* The commonly known Germanic verb 'to seek' (Gothic `sokjan`, OE `sēcan`, etc.) actually derives from a different ablaut grade of the root, PGmc `*sōkijaną` (from PIE o-grade `*soh₂g-`). The question, however, specifically asks to trace the form `*seh₂gieti` (e-grade), which gives PGmc `*sākijaną`. The following derivations are based on this form as requested.\n\n### **Step 3: Derivation of the Old Norse (ON) Form**\n\n1.  **Starting Form:** PGmc `*sākijaną`.\n2.  **I-Umlaut (I-Mutation):** The `*j` in the suffix `*-janą` causes the preceding long back vowel `*ā` (/aː/) to be fronted. In Old Norse, `*ā` + `*j` results in long `*æ` (/æː/).\n    *   `*sāk-` → `*sæk-`\n3.  **Suffix Change:** The Proto-Germanic ending `*-janą` reduces to `-ja` in Old Norse for the infinitive of Class 1 weak verbs after a long syllable.\n4.  **Final Synthesis:** Combining the mutated root with the ending.\n\n*   **Old Norse Result:** **sækja** (This may also be spelled `sœkja`, although that spelling is more strictly associated with the umlaut of *o-vowels).\n\n### **Step 4: Derivation of the Old English (OE) Form**\n\n1.  **Starting Form:** PGmc `*sākijaną`.\n2.  **I-Umlaut (I-Mutation):** As in Old Norse, the `*j` causes mutation of the root vowel. In the West Germanic dialects, PGmc `*ā` results in `*ā`. The i-umlaut of this `*ā` gives Old English long `*ǣ`.\n    *   `*sāk-` → `*sǣk-`\n3.  **Palatalization:** The Proto-Germanic cluster `*kj` is palatalized in Old English to `ċċ` or, after a long vowel, `ċ` (pronounced /tʃ/, as in 'church').\n    *   `*-kjan-` → `-ċan`\n4.  **Ending Change:** The infinitive ending `*-aną` becomes `-an` in Old English.\n5.  **Final Synthesis:** This gives us the hypothetical, but phonologically regular, reflex.\n\n*   **Old English Result:** **\\*sǣċan** (This is the direct descendant of `*sākijaną`. The attested word is `sēcan`, which comes from the alternate `*sōkijaną`).\n\n### **Step 5: Derivation of the Old High German (OHG) Form**\n\n1.  **Starting Form:** PGmc `*sākijaną`.\n2.  **Second Sound Shift (High German Consonant Shift):** The PGmc voiceless stop `*k` shifts to the voiceless fricative `*hh` when it follows a vowel.\n    *   `*sāk-` → `*sāhh-`\n3.  **Vowel System:** PGmc `*ā` is generally retained as long `*ā` in Old High German. I-umlaut on this vowel was inconsistent and often not written in the infinitive form, though it would appear in other parts of the paradigm (e.g., 2nd/3rd person singular present).\n4.  **Ending Change:** The infinitive ending `*-janą` becomes `-en` (with spellings like `-an` also common). The `j` is lost.\n5.  **Final Synthesis:** Putting the pieces together gives the expected OHG infinitive.\n\n*   **Old High German Result:** **sāhhan**\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nBased on the phonological rules applied to the given PIE form `*seh₂gieti`:\n\n*   **Proto-Germanic:** *sākijaną\n*   **Old Norse:** sækja\n*   **Old English:** *sǣċan\n*   **Old High German:** sāhhan\n\n<<<**Proto-Germanic:** *sākijaną; **Old Norse:** sækja; **Old English:** *sǣċan; **Old High German:** sāhhan>>>"
