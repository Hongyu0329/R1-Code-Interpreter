    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the separatrix of the given system of differential equations.\n\n**Step 1: Write down the system and identify its components**\n\nThe system of differential equations is:\n1.  $d'(t) = 2d(t)^2 + (-3u(t) + 5u(t)^2)d(t) - u(t)^3(1 - u(t))$\n2.  $u'(t) = (u(t) - 1)u(t)^2$\n\nWe can write this as:\n$d' = 2d^2 + (5u^2 - 3u)d - u^3 + u^4$\n$u' = u^3 - u^2$\n\nWe are interested in the phase plane for $u \\ge 0$. A separatrix is a curve (or a set of curves) that divides the phase plane into regions of qualitatively different behavior. Separatrices are typically the stable and/or unstable manifolds of saddle-type equilibrium points.\n\n**Step 2: Find the equilibrium points**\n\nEquilibrium points are points $(d, u)$ where $d' = 0$ and $u' = 0$.\nFirst, solve $u' = 0$:\n$u^2(u - 1) = 0 \\implies u = 0$ or $u = 1$.\n\nNow, substitute these values of $u$ into the equation $d' = 0$.\n\nCase 1: $u = 0$\n$2d^2 + (5(0)^2 - 3(0))d - 0^3 + 0^4 = 0$\n$2d^2 = 0 \\implies d = 0$.\nSo, we have an equilibrium point at **(0, 0)**.\n\nCase 2: $u = 1$\n$2d^2 + (5(1)^2 - 3(1))d - 1^3 + 1^4 = 0$\n$2d^2 + (5 - 3)d - 1 + 1 = 0$\n$2d^2 + 2d = 0$\n$2d(d + 1) = 0 \\implies d = 0$ or $d = -1$.\nSo, we have two more equilibrium points at **(0, 1)** and **(-1, 1)**.\n\n**Step 3: Classify the equilibrium points**\n\nTo classify the equilibrium points, we compute the Jacobian matrix of the system:\n$J(d, u) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial d'}{\\partial d} & \\frac{\\partial d'}{\\partial u} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial d} & \\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial u} \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThe partial derivatives are:\n$\\frac{\\partial d'}{\\partial d} = 4d + 5u^2 - 3u$\n$\\frac{\\partial d'}{\\partial u} = 10ud - 3d + 4u^3 - 3u^2$\n$\\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial d} = 0$\n$\\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial u} = 3u^2 - 2u$\n\nNow evaluate the Jacobian at each equilibrium point:\n\n*   **At (0, 1):**\n    $J(0, 1) = \\begin{pmatrix} 4(0) + 5(1)^2 - 3(1) & 10(0)(1) - 3(0) + 4(1)^3 - 3(1)^2 \\\\ 0 & 3(1)^2 - 2(1) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    The eigenvalues are the diagonal entries, $\\lambda_1 = 2$ and $\\lambda_2 = 1$. Since both are positive, (0, 1) is an **unstable node (repeller)**.\n\n*   **At (-1, 1):**\n    $J(-1, 1) = \\begin{pmatrix} 4(-1) + 5(1)^2 - 3(1) & 10(-1)(1) - 3(-1) + 4(1)^3 - 3(1)^2 \\\\ 0 & 3(1)^2 - 2(1) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -4 + 5 - 3 & -10 + 3 + 4 - 3 \\\\ 0 & 3 - 2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -2 & -6 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1 = -2$ (stable) and $\\lambda_2 = 1$ (unstable). Since the eigenvalues have opposite signs, (-1, 1) is a **saddle point**.\n\n*   **At (0, 0):**\n    $J(0, 0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    The linearization is inconclusive. This is a degenerate point.\n\n**Step 4: Find the separatrix associated with the saddle point**\n\nThe separatrix is formed by the stable and unstable manifolds of the saddle point (-1, 1). Let's find the unstable manifold, as it typically separates basins of attraction.\n\nThe unstable manifold is tangent to the eigenvector corresponding to the positive eigenvalue $\\lambda_2 = 1$. Let $v = (x, y)^T$ be the eigenvector.\n$(J - \\lambda_2 I)v = 0 \\implies \\begin{pmatrix} -2 - 1 & -6 \\\\ 0 & 1 - 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n$\\begin{pmatrix} -3 & -6 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\nThis gives the equation $-3x - 6y = 0$, or $x = -2y$.\nThe eigenvector for the unstable manifold is $v_u = \\begin{pmatrix} -2 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$. This means the unstable manifold leaves the saddle point (-1, 1) with a slope of $dy/dx = 1/(-2) = -1/2$.\n\n**Step 5: Find an equation for the separatrix**\n\nWe look for an invariant curve of the form $d = f(u)$ that passes through the saddle point. If a curve $d=f(u)$ is invariant, it must satisfy $\\frac{d(d)}{dt} = \\frac{df}{du} \\frac{du}{dt}$, which is $d' = f'(u) u'$. Let's try a simple polynomial form, such as a parabola $d = au^2 + bu + c$.\n\nThe separatrix is an unstable manifold of (-1, 1). This manifold might connect to another equilibrium point. A likely candidate is the degenerate point (0, 0). Let's assume the curve passes through both (-1, 1) and (0, 0).\n*   Passes through (0, 0): $0 = a(0)^2 + b(0) + c \\implies c = 0$.\n*   Passes through (-1, 1): $-1 = a(1)^2 + b(1) + 0 \\implies a + b = -1$, so $b = -1 - a$.\n\nThe candidate curve is $d = au^2 - (a+1)u$.\nNow we substitute this into the differential equations.\n$d' = (2au - (a+1))u'$.\nThe condition for invariance is:\n$2d^2 + (5u^2 - 3u)d - u^3(1 - u) = (2au - (a+1))(u^2(u - 1))$\nSubstitute $d = u(au - (a+1))$:\n$2u^2(au - (a+1))^2 + u(5u - 3)u(au - (a+1)) + u^3(u - 1) = u^2(u - 1)(2au - (a+1))$\nDivide by $u^2$ (for $u \\neq 0$):\n$2(au - (a+1))^2 + (5u - 3)(au - (a+1)) + u(u - 1) = (u - 1)(2au - (a+1))$\nExpanding both sides and collecting terms by powers of $u$ leads to a polynomial identity in $u$. The coefficients must match. Comparing the coefficients of $u^2$ and the constant terms gives two equations for $a$:\n1.  From the $u^2$ coefficient: $2a = 2a^2 + 5a + 1 \\implies 2a^2 + 3a + 1 = 0 \\implies (2a+1)(a+1)=0$. So $a=-1$ or $a=-1/2$.\n2.  From the constant term: $a+1 = 2a^2 + 7a + 5 \\implies 2a^2 + 6a + 4 = 0 \\implies a^2+3a+2=0 \\implies (a+1)(a+2)=0$. So $a=-1$ or $a=-2$.\n\nThe only common solution is $a = -1$.\nWith $a = -1$, we get $b = -1 - (-1) = 0$.\nSo the invariant curve is $d = -u^2$.\n\nLet's check the tangent of this curve at the saddle point (-1, 1).\nFor $d = -u^2$, we have $\\frac{d(d)}{du} = -2u$.\nAt $u=1$, the slope in the $(u, d)$ plane is $\\frac{d(d)}{du}|_{u=1} = -2$.\nThe tangent vector is $(du, d(d)) = (1, -2)$, which is equivalent to $(-1, 2)$. Whoops, the axes are $(d, u)$. So the tangent vector is $(\\frac{d(d)}{du}, 1)=(-2,1)$. This matches the unstable eigenvector $v_u = (-2, 1)$ we found earlier.\n\nThus, the curve $d = -u^2$ is the unstable manifold of the saddle point (-1, 1). This manifold is a separatrix. It connects the saddle point (-1, 1) to the equilibrium point (0, 0). It separates the basin of attraction of the equilibrium point (0, 0) from the region of phase space where trajectories escape to infinity ($d \\to \\infty$).\n\nThe separatrix is the curve defined by the equation $d = -u^2$."
