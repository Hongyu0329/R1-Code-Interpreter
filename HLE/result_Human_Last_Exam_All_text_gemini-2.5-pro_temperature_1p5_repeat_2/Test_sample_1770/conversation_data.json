    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal and the Problem**\nThe main objective is to produce p-coumaric acid using an engineered strain of *Corynebacterium glutamicum*. The problem is that the native metabolism of the bacterium degrades the p-coumaric acid after it is produced, leading to low yields. We need to identify the specific gene responsible for this degradation so it can be removed (knocked out).\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Relevant Metabolic Pathway**\nWe need to determine how *Corynebacterium glutamicum* naturally breaks down p-coumaric acid. Aromatic compounds like p-coumaric acid can be used as carbon sources by many bacteria. This involves specific catabolic pathways. For p-coumaric acid, a major and very common initial degradation step in bacteria is a decarboxylation reaction.\n\n**Step 3: Characterize the Degradation Reaction**\n*   **Substrate:** p-coumaric acid (also called 4-hydroxycinnamic acid).\n*   **Reaction:** Decarboxylation. This means the carboxyl group (-COOH) is removed from the side chain of the molecule.\n*   **Product:** The decarboxylation of p-coumaric acid yields 4-vinylphenol and carbon dioxide (COâ‚‚).\n*   **Significance:** This reaction is a direct and irreversible loss of the desired product, converting it into a different chemical.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Enzyme and Gene**\n*   **Enzyme:** The enzyme that catalyzes this specific reaction is called **p-coumarate decarboxylase** or, more broadly, **phenolic acid decarboxylase**.\n*   **Gene:** The gene that codes for this enzyme is typically named **`pdc`** (for **p**henolic acid **d**e**c**arboxylase) or sometimes `padC` in other organisms. In *Corynebacterium glutamicum*, this is the standard designation for the gene responsible for this activity. Knocking out this gene prevents the conversion of p-coumaric acid to 4-vinylphenol.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude the Solution**\nTo stop the degradation of the produced p-coumaric acid, the most direct and effective strategy is to eliminate the enzyme that carries out the first step of its breakdown. Therefore, the gene that must be knocked out is the one encoding p-coumarate decarboxylase. This has been a standard and proven genetic modification in numerous scientific studies focused on producing p-coumaric acid and other related compounds in *C. glutamicum*.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n*   **Specificity:** We must identify the primary degradation pathway. While other downstream genes in aromatic catabolism also exist (e.g., genes for degrading protocatechuate like the `pca` cluster), the `pdc` gene represents the most direct and often most active route for the initial loss of p-coumaric acid itself.\n*   **Host Organism:** The answer is specific to *Corynebacterium glutamicum*, although similar enzymes exist in other microorganisms like *E. coli* and yeast.\n*   **Gene Nomenclature:** Gene names can vary slightly between databases and specific strains, but `pdc` is the widely accepted name for this function in the context of metabolic engineering in *C. glutamicum*.\n\nBy knocking out the `pdc` gene, the pathway from p-coumaric acid to 4-vinylphenol is blocked, forcing the desired product to accumulate in the cell or medium instead of being degraded.\n\n<<<pdc (p-coumarate decarboxylase)>>>"
