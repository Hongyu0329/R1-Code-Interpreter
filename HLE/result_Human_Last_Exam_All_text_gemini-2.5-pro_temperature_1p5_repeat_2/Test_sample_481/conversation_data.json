    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Request:** The goal is to identify the numbers imprinted on Teva brand fluoxetine capsules for two specific strengths: 10mg and 20mg.\n2.  **Identify Constraints:** There are explicit instructions to ignore or exclude certain information:\n    *   Do not mention color.\n    *   Do not mention the word \"PLIVA\".\n    *   Do not mention size.\n    *   The focus must be solely on the imprinted numbers.\n3.  **Research Teva Fluoxetine 10mg Capsule Imprints:** Researching official pharmaceutical identifiers for Teva's 10mg fluoxetine capsule reveals two common versions in circulation:\n    *   One version is imprinted with \"TEVA\" on one part and **7187** on the other.\n    *   Another version, distributed by Teva through its subsidiary Pliva, is imprinted with \"PLIVA\" on one part and **647** on the other. Per the instructions, we only consider the number.\n4.  **Research Teva Fluoxetine 20mg Capsule Imprints:** A similar search for Teva's 20mg fluoxetine capsule also shows two common versions:\n    *   One version is imprinted with \"TEVA\" on one part and **7188** on the other.\n    *   Another version is imprinted with \"PLIVA\" on one part and **648** on the other. Again, we only focus on the number.\n5.  **Synthesize and Compare:** Now we compare the numbers found for each strength, respecting all the user's constraints.\n    *   The 10mg capsule is identified by the number **647** or **7187**.\n    *   The 20mg capsule is identified by the number **648** or **7188**.\n    *   The numbers are different for each strength, which is standard practice for medication identification.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Teva and Pliva:** Teva Pharmaceuticals is the parent company of Pliva. Therefore, a capsule with \"PLIVA\" imprinted on it is a Teva brand product. The user's instruction was not to use the word \"PLIVA\", but the number **647** (or **648**) from that capsule is still a valid answer for a number found on a Teva product.\n*   **Multiple Imprints:** It is common for a single generic medication from a large manufacturer to have more than one approved imprint and appearance (known as a \"trade dress\"). It is important to acknowledge both possibilities for a complete answer.\n*   **Clarity of the Answer:** The question asks for \"the different numbers\". The most direct way to answer is to state which numbers correspond to which strength.\n\nBy following these steps and acknowledging the careful points, we can determine the correct numbers for each capsule.\n\n<<<The number imprinted on the 10mg capsule is 647 or 7187, and the number on the 20mg capsule is 648 or 7188.>>>"
