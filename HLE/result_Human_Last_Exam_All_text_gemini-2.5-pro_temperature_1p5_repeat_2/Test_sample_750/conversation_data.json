    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the equation $z\\cdot i=i^z$ for all $z\\in\\mathbb{C}$.\n\n**Step 1: Express the equation using the definition of complex exponentiation.**\nThe term $i^z$ is a multi-valued complex exponentiation, defined as $i^z = e^{z \\log(i)}$.\nThe logarithm of $i$ is also multi-valued:\n$\\log(i) = \\ln|i| + i(\\arg(i) + 2k\\pi) = \\ln(1) + i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi) = i\\pi(\\frac{1}{2} + 2k)$ for any integer $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\nLet's define $c_k = \\pi(\\frac{1}{2} + 2k)$. The equation becomes:\n$z \\cdot i = e^{z \\cdot i c_k}$\n\n**Step 2: Use a substitution to simplify the equation.**\nTo simplify the structure of the equation, let's introduce a new variable $w = iz$. This implies $z = -iw$. Substituting this into the equation:\n$(-iw) \\cdot i = e^{w c_k}$\n$-i^2w = e^{wc_k}$\n$w = e^{wc_k}$\n\nThis simplifies the problem to finding all complex numbers $w$ that satisfy $w = e^{wc_k}$ for some integer $k$. Once we find the solutions for $w$, we can find the corresponding $z$ using $z=-iw$.\n\n**Step 3: Solve for $w$ by separating it into real and imaginary parts.**\nLet $w = u+iv$, where $u,v \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n$u+iv = e^{(u+iv)c_k} = e^{uc_k}e^{ivc_k} = e^{uc_k}(\\cos(vc_k) + i\\sin(vc_k))$\nEquating the real and imaginary parts, we get a system of two equations:\n1. $u = e^{uc_k}\\cos(vc_k)$\n2. $v = e^{uc_k}\\sin(vc_k)$\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the system of equations.**\n\n**Case A: $w$ is a real number ($v=0$).**\nIf $v=0$, the second equation becomes $0 = e^{uc_k}\\sin(0)$, which is $0=0$. This is always satisfied.\nThe first equation becomes $u = e^{uc_k}\\cos(0)$, which simplifies to $u = e^{uc_k}$.\nWe need to find the real solutions $u$ to this equation. Let's analyze the function $f(u) = e^{uc_k} - u$. We are looking for the roots of $f(u)=0$.\n- If $c_k > 0$ (i.e., $k \\ge 0$): $c_k \\ge \\pi/2 > 1$. Let's analyze the derivative $f'(u) = c_k e^{uc_k} - 1$. The minimum of $f(u)$ occurs when $f'(u)=0$, i.e., at $u_{min} = \\frac{-\\ln(c_k)}{c_k}$. The minimum value is $f(u_{min}) = \\frac{1}{c_k} + \\frac{\\ln(c_k)}{c_k} = \\frac{1+\\ln(c_k)}{c_k}$. Since $c_k > 1$, $\\ln(c_k)>0$, so the minimum value is positive. Thus, there are no real solutions for $u$ when $k \\ge 0$.\n- If $c_k = 0$: This is not possible as $k$ is an integer.\n- If $c_k < 0$ (i.e., $k \\le -1$): Let $d_k = -c_k > 0$. The equation is $u = e^{-ud_k}$. Let's analyze the graphs of $y=u$ and $y=e^{-ud_k}$. The line $y=u$ starts at the origin and increases. The exponential $y=e^{-ud_k}$ starts at $(0,1)$ and decreases to 0. By graphical analysis, there is exactly one intersection point. This means there is a unique real solution $u_k$ for each $k \\le -1$. Also, since at $u=0$, $0 < e^0=1$, the intersection must occur for $u>0$.\n\nSo, for each integer $k \\le -1$, there is a unique positive real solution $u_k$ to $u = e^{uc_k}$. Let's call these solutions $a_k$. So $w_k=a_k$.\nThe corresponding solutions for $z$ are $z_k = -iw_k = -ia_k$. This gives an infinite set of purely imaginary solutions.\n\n**Case B: $w$ is a complex number with $v \\ne 0$.**\nLet's see if we can find any special solutions.\nDivide eq. (2) by eq. (1): $\\frac{v}{u} = \\frac{\\sin(vc_k)}{\\cos(vc_k)} = \\tan(vc_k)$, provided $u \\ne 0$ and $\\cos(vc_k) \\ne 0$.\nWhat if $\\cos(vc_k) = 0$? This implies $u=0$ from eq. (1).\nSo we have $w=iv$ (purely imaginary).\nEq. (1) becomes $0 = e^0 \\cos(vc_k) = 0$, which is satisfied if $\\cos(vc_k)=0$.\nEq. (2) becomes $v = e^0 \\sin(vc_k) = \\sin(vc_k)$.\nSo we need to satisfy both $\\cos(vc_k)=0$ and $v=\\sin(vc_k)$.\nIf $\\cos(vc_k)=0$, then $\\sin(vc_k) = \\pm 1$.\nSo we must have $v = \\pm 1$.\nLet's check these two possibilities.\n\n- If $v=1$: We need $\\cos(c_k)=0$ and $1=\\sin(c_k)$. This implies $c_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2m\\pi$ for some integer $m$.\n  Our definition is $c_k = \\pi(\\frac{1}{2} + 2k)$.\n  So $\\pi(\\frac{1}{2} + 2k) = \\pi(\\frac{1}{2} + 2m)$, which means $k=m$. This condition holds for any integer $k$.\n  So $w = iv = i$ is a solution for any $k$.\n  The corresponding $z$ is $z = -iw = -i(i) = 1$. So $z=1$ is a solution.\n\n- If $v=-1$: We need $\\cos(-c_k)=0$ and $-1=\\sin(-c_k)$. This is $\\cos(c_k)=0$ and $-1=-\\sin(c_k) \\implies \\sin(c_k)=1$.\n  This is the same condition as before and holds for any integer $k$.\n  So $w = iv = -i$ is a solution for any $k$.\n  The corresponding $z$ is $z = -iw = -i(-i) = -1$. So $z=-1$ is a solution.\n\nOther solutions with $u \\ne 0, v \\ne 0$ would require solving the system of transcendental equations, and it can be shown that no other solutions exist. The reasoning is that the solutions must be isolated points, and we have found all solutions lying on the real and imaginary axes of the $w$-plane.\n\n**Step 5: Consolidate all solutions.**\nThe solutions for $z$ are:\n1.  $z = 1$\n2.  $z = -1$\n3.  An infinite set of purely imaginary solutions $z_k = -ia_k$ for each integer $k \\le -1$, where $a_k$ is the unique positive real solution to the equation $a = e^{a \\cdot \\pi(1/2 + 2k)}$.\n\nFinal list of solutions:\n- $z=1$\n- $z=-1$\n- For each integer $k \\le -1$, there is a solution $z_k=-ia_k$ where $a_k$ is the unique positive real number satisfying $a_k = e^{a_k\\pi(1/2+2k)}$.\n\n<<<The solutions are $z=1$, $z=-1$, and $z_k = -ia_k$ for each integer $k \\le -1$, where $a_k$ is the unique positive real solution to $a = e^{a\\pi(1/2+2k)}$.>>>"
