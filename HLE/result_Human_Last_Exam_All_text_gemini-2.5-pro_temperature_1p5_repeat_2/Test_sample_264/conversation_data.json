    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the volume of the intersection of the two cubes.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Define the initial setup and coordinate system.**\nTo analyze the problem, it's best to place the first cube (let's call it Cube A) in a standard position within a 3D Cartesian coordinate system. Let's define the corners of Cube A to be at coordinates `(x, y, z)` where `x, y, z` can be either 0 or 1. This means Cube A occupies the region defined by the inequalities:\n*   `0 ≤ x ≤ 1`\n*   `0 ≤ y ≤ 1`\n*   `0 ≤ z ≤ 1`\nThe side length of this cube is 1, and its volume is `1^3 = 1`.\n\n**Step 2: Understand and define the shift.**\nThe second cube (Cube B) is shifted relative to Cube A. The shift is described as being \"by 1/2 along the main diagonal\".\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Identifying the Main Diagonal.** A main diagonal of a cube connects two opposite vertices. For our Cube A in `[0,1]^3`, the most straightforward main diagonal connects the origin `(0, 0, 0)` to the opposite vertex `(1, 1, 1)`. The vector representing this diagonal is `d = (1, 1, 1)`.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Interpreting the Shift \"by 1/2\".** This is the most crucial part of the problem. The phrase \"shifted by 1/2 along the main diagonal\" can be interpreted in two ways:\n    1.  A shift by a *distance* of 1/2 in the direction of the vector `(1, 1, 1)`. This would result in a complex, irrational shift vector.\n    2.  A shift by a vector equal to `1/2` of the main diagonal vector `d`. The shift vector `s` would be `s = (1/2) * d = 1/2 * (1, 1, 1) = (1/2, 1/2, 1/2)`.\n    In mathematical problems of this nature, the second interpretation is standard. It creates a simpler and more symmetric geometry, where the corner of one cube `(0,0,0)` moves to the exact center of the other cube `(1/2, 1/2, 1/2)`. We will proceed with this interpretation.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the position of the second cube.**\nCube B is the result of shifting Cube A by the vector `s = (1/2, 1/2, 1/2)`. This means we add `1/2` to all the coordinate boundaries of Cube A.\n*   Original x-range of Cube A: `[0, 1]` -> New x-range for Cube B: `[0 + 1/2, 1 + 1/2] = [1/2, 3/2]`\n*   Original y-range of Cube A: `[0, 1]` -> New y-range for Cube B: `[0 + 1/2, 1 + 1/2] = [1/2, 3/2]`\n*   Original z-range of Cube A: `[0, 1]` -> New z-range for Cube B: `[0 + 1/2, 1 + 1/2] = [1/2, 3/2]`\nSo, Cube B occupies the region `[1/2, 3/2] x [1/2, 3/2] x [1/2, 3/2]`.\n\n**Step 4: Find the region of intersection.**\nThe intersection of the two cubes is the region of space that belongs to both Cube A and Cube B. To find this, we find the overlap in each coordinate dimension.\n\n*   **x-dimension:** Cube A is `[0, 1]`, Cube B is `[1/2, 3/2]`. The intersection of these two intervals is `[1/2, 1]`.\n*   **y-dimension:** Cube A is `[0, 1]`, Cube B is `[1/2, 3/2]`. The intersection is `[1/2, 1]`.\n*   **z-dimension:** Cube A is `[0, 1]`, Cube B is `[1/2, 3/2]`. The intersection is `[1/2, 1]`.\n\nThe intersection is a rectangular prism defined by `[1/2, 1] x [1/2, 1] x [1/2, 1]`.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the volume of the intersection.**\nThe shape of the intersection is a cube. The side length of this intersection cube is `1 - 1/2 = 1/2`.\nThe volume of a cube is `(side length)^3`.\nVolume of intersection = `(1/2)^3 = 1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/8`.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe volume of the intersection of the two cubes is 1/8.\n\n<<<1/8>>>"
