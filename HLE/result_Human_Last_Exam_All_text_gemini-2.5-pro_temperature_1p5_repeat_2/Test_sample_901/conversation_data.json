    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Reactants and Reaction Type**\n*   **Substrate:** (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane. This is a secondary alkyl halide.\n*   **Reagent:** Potassium tert-butoxide (KOtBu). This is a strong and sterically bulky (hindered) base.\n*   **Solvent:** tert-butyl alcohol. This is a polar protic solvent, which is the conjugate acid of the base.\n*   **Reaction Type:** The combination of a secondary alkyl halide with a strong base strongly indicates an elimination reaction, specifically an **E2 (bimolecular elimination) reaction**. The bulky base will disfavor any SN2 substitution side reactions.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Stereochemistry of the Substrate**\n*   The IUPAC name (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane tells us the specific 3D arrangement of the atoms. For a 1,2-disubstituted cyclohexane, an R,S configuration (or S,R) means the substituents are **trans** to each other (one pointing \"up\" and one \"down\" relative to the ring plane).\n*   A trans-1,2-disubstituted cyclohexane exists as an equilibrium between two chair conformations: one where both groups are equatorial (diequatorial) and one where both groups are axial (diaxial).\n*   The diequatorial conformation is significantly more stable because it minimizes steric strain (1,3-diaxial interactions). The diaxial conformation is much less stable and exists in a much lower concentration at equilibrium.\n\n**Step 3: Apply the Stereochemical Requirement of the E2 Reaction**\n*   A critical requirement for the E2 reaction is that the leaving group (Bromine) and the beta-proton (a proton on an adjacent carbon) must be in an **anti-periplanar** conformation.\n*   In a cyclohexane chair, this anti-periplanar requirement translates to a **trans-diaxial** arrangement. Both the leaving group and the beta-proton must be in axial positions, on opposite faces of the ring.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Reactive Conformation and Possible Elimination Pathways**\n*   The E2 reaction cannot occur from the more stable diequatorial conformer because the equatorial bromine is not anti-periplanar to any beta-protons (which would be axial).\n*   The reaction must proceed through the less stable **diaxial** conformer, where the bromine is in an axial position. Even though this conformer is in low concentration, the reaction will proceed through it.\n*   Let's analyze the beta-protons in the reactive (diaxial) conformer:\n    *   **Bromine is at C1 (axial).**\n    *   **Beta-position C2:** In this conformer, the methyl group is also **axial**. This means the hydrogen on C2 must be **equatorial**. Since this proton is not axial, it is not trans-diaxial to the bromine. Therefore, **elimination towards C2 is impossible**. This would have formed the more substituted Zaitsev product (1-methylcyclohexene), but it is stereochemically forbidden.\n    *   **Beta-position C6:** This carbon has two hydrogens, one axial and one equatorial. The **axial hydrogen on C6 is trans-diaxial** to the axial bromine on C1.\n*   Therefore, the tert-butoxide base can only abstract the axial proton from C6.\n\n**Step 5: Identify the Final Product**\n*   The elimination of the H from C6 and the Br from C1 results in the formation of a double bond between C1 and C6.\n*   The methyl group on C2 is not involved in the elimination and remains in the product structure.\n*   The resulting alkene has the methyl group at the position adjacent to the double bond. To name it, we number the ring starting from the double bond such that the substituent gets the lowest possible number. The double bond carbons are C1 and C2 (in the final product name), and the methyl group is on C3.\n*   Thus, the name of the product is **3-methylcyclohexene**.\n\n**Careful Points Summarized:**\n1.  Recognize the reaction is E2 due to the strong, bulky base.\n2.  Understand that (1S,2R) means the substituents are trans.\n3.  The E2 reaction on a cyclohexane ring requires a trans-diaxial arrangement of H and the leaving group.\n4.  The reaction must proceed through the less stable diaxial conformer.\n5.  In the reactive diaxial conformer, the axial methyl group at C2 prevents elimination towards C2 (Zaitsev pathway) because the H at C2 is equatorial.\n6.  The only possible elimination is via the axial H on C6, leading to the less substituted alkene (Hofmann-type product).\n7.  The final product must be named correctly according to IUPAC alkene nomenclature rules.\n\nThe final product of the reaction is **3-methylcyclohexene**.\n\n<<<3-methylcyclohexene>>>"
