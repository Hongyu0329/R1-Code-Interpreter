    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the number of empty edge squares.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Edge Squares**\nA standard 8x8 chessboard has 64 squares in total. The edge of the board consists of the first and last ranks (rows 1 and 8) and the first and last files (columns 'a' and 'h').\n*   Number of squares in rank 1 = 8\n*   Number of squares in rank 8 = 8\n*   Number of squares in file 'a' (excluding the corners already counted) = 6\n*   Number of squares in file 'h' (excluding the corners already counted) = 6\nThe total number of edge squares is 8 + 8 + 6 + 6 = **28**.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Goal and Constraints**\nThe goal is to place the maximum possible number of bishops on these 28 edge squares. The main constraint is that no two bishops can be placed on the same diagonal, as they would attack each other.\n\n**Step 3: Devise a Strategy for Maximal Placement**\nA bishop's power extends across the board along diagonals of its color. Placing bishops along the board's sides is an effective way to control many diagonals. Let's try placing bishops on two opposite edges, for instance, the 'a' file and the 'h' file.\n\n1.  **Place bishops on the 'a' file:** We can place 8 bishops on every square of the 'a' file, from a1 to a8. None of these bishops attack each other, as they are all on different diagonals.\n\n2.  **Place bishops on the 'h' file:** Now, let's see which squares on the 'h' file are safe to place a bishop on, considering the 8 bishops already on the 'a' file.\n    *   **h1:** A bishop on h1 would be on the same main diagonal as a8 (the a8-h1 diagonal). Therefore, we cannot place a bishop on h1.\n    *   **h8:** A bishop on h8 would be on the same anti-diagonal as a1 (the a1-h8 diagonal). Therefore, we cannot place a bishop on h8.\n    *   **h2 to h7:** Let's check if a bishop at a_i (where i is from 2 to 7) attacks any square h_j (where j is from 2 to 7). A bishop at (a,i) attacks along two diagonals.\n        *   The main diagonal (up and to the right): It cannot reach the 'h' file before going off the top of the board.\n        *   The anti-diagonal (down and to the right): It cannot reach the 'h' file before going off the bottom of the board.\n        Therefore, the 6 squares from h2 to h7 are all safe from the bishops on file 'a'. We can place 6 bishops on these squares {h2, h3, h4, h5, h6, h7}.\n\n3.  **Combine the placements:** We have successfully placed 8 bishops on file 'a' and 6 bishops on file 'h', for a total of **14 bishops**. All these bishops are on edge squares, and no two bishops attack each other.\n\n**Step 4: Verify Maximality**\nIs it possible to place any more bishops on the remaining empty edge squares? The remaining edge squares are on ranks 1 and 8 (excluding the corners).\n\n*   **Rank 1 squares (b1 to g1):** A bishop on any square (c,1) on rank 1 is attacked by a bishop on the 'a' file. Specifically, the bishop at a_(c) attacks (c,1) via an anti-diagonal (e.g., the bishop at a2 attacks b1, a3 attacks c1, and so on). Thus, no more bishops can be placed on rank 1.\n*   **Rank 8 squares (b8 to g8):** Similarly, a bishop on any square (c,8) on rank 8 is attacked by a bishop on the 'a' file. Specifically, the bishop at a_(9-c) attacks (c,8) via a main diagonal (e.g., the bishop at a7 attacks b8, a6 attacks c8, and so on). Thus, no more bishops can be placed on rank 8.\n\nSince all other edge squares are attacked, 14 is the maximum number of bishops that can be placed on the edge squares.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Final Answer**\nThe question asks for the number of edge squares that would *lack* bishops.\n\n*   Total number of edge squares: 28\n*   Maximum number of bishops placed: 14\n*   Number of empty edge squares = Total squares - Placed bishops\n*   Number of empty edge squares = 28 - 14 = 14\n\nIf the players succeeded in placing the maximum possible number of bishops on the edge squares, 14 edge squares would lack bishops.\n\n<<<14>>>"
