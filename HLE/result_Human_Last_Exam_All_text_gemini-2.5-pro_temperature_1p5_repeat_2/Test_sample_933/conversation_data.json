    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction:** The question is about the synthesis of Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF4). This is typically produced by the direct reaction of elemental xenon (Xe) and fluorine (F2).\n    *   The balanced chemical equation is: Xe(g) + 2F2(g) → XeF4(s)\n\n2.  **Analyze the reaction conditions:** This reaction is an oxidation of xenon by the highly reactive fluorine. Like many chemical reactions, it requires certain conditions of temperature, pressure, and reactant ratios to proceed efficiently and to favor the desired product (XeF4) over other possible products like XeF2 or XeF6.\n    *   **Reactant Ratio:** To produce XeF4, a molar ratio of Xe to F2 of about 1:5 is typically used. An excess of fluorine is needed to push the reaction beyond the formation of XeF2.\n    *   **Energy Input (Activation Energy):** The reaction has a significant activation energy. This means that the reactants need a substantial input of energy to start reacting at a reasonable rate. This energy is usually supplied in the form of heat. While other methods like photochemical activation (UV light) or electric discharge exist, thermal synthesis is the most common and is generally considered efficient for producing bulk quantities.\n    *   **Temperature:** The temperature must be high enough to overcome the activation energy and make the reaction proceed at a practical, or \"efficient,\" rate. However, the temperature should not be so high that it causes the product (XeF4) to decompose or favors the formation of other xenon fluorides like XeF6.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the standard synthesis temperature:** Based on established chemical literature and standard laboratory/industrial procedures, the synthesis of XeF4 is performed by heating the mixture of xenon and fluorine (in a 1:5 molar ratio) in a sealed nickel or Monel vessel.\n    *   The optimal temperature cited for this synthesis to be efficient (giving a good yield in a reasonable amount of time) is **400 °C**.\n    *   At this temperature, the reaction rate is sufficiently high. The solid XeF4 product can be isolated by cooling the reaction vessel, causing the gaseous reactants and the solid product to be easily separated.\n\n4.  **Consider the given temperature choices and the \"coldest efficient\" criterion:**\n    *   **A. 600 °C:** This temperature is significantly higher than the standard 400 °C. At this temperature, the reaction is more likely to produce Xenon hexafluoride (XeF6) if enough fluorine is present. It is not the *coldest* temperature for efficient XeF4 production.\n    *   **B. 400 °C:** This is the well-documented, standard temperature for the efficient synthesis of XeF4. It provides the necessary activation energy for a good reaction rate.\n    *   **C. 200 °C:** At 200 °C, the thermal energy is significantly lower than at 400 °C. According to the principles of chemical kinetics (like the Arrhenius equation), the reaction rate would be drastically slower. While some XeF4 might form over a very long period, the process would not be considered \"efficient.\"\n    *   **D. 78 °C, E. 0 °C, F. -78 °C:** These temperatures are far too low to provide the necessary thermal energy to overcome the activation barrier for this reaction. The reaction rate would be negligible, and production would be virtually non-existent and certainly not efficient.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The question asks for the coldest temperature at which the synthesis is still *efficient*. While it might be theoretically possible to produce trace amounts at temperatures below 400 °C, the rate becomes impractically slow. Therefore, 400 °C is considered the benchmark for an efficient thermal synthesis process. It is the lowest temperature among the choices that allows for efficient production.\n\n<<<B>>>"
