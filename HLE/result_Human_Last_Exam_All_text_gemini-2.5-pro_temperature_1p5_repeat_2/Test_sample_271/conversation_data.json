    "Answering the question requires a multi-step analysis using Galois theory.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the polynomial**\nLet the given polynomial be $P(x) = x^7 - 2 x^5 - 9 x^3 + 3 x^2 + 18 x - 6$.\nWe first try to factor this polynomial. We can rearrange the terms and factor by grouping:\n$P(x) = (x^7 - 2x^5 - 9x^3 + 18x) + (3x^2 - 6)$\n$P(x) = x(x^6 - 2x^4 - 9x^2 + 18) + 3(x^2 - 2)$\nNow we factor the expression in the first parenthesis:\n$x^6 - 2x^4 - 9x^2 + 18 = x^4(x^2 - 2) - 9(x^2 - 2) = (x^4 - 9)(x^2 - 2)$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $P(x)$:\n$P(x) = x(x^4 - 9)(x^2 - 2) + 3(x^2 - 2)$\n$P(x) = (x(x^4 - 9) + 3)(x^2 - 2)$\n$P(x) = (x^5 - 9x + 3)(x^2 - 2)$\nSo, the polynomial $P(x)$ factors into two polynomials over $\\mathbb{Q}$: $f(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$ and $g(x) = x^2 - 2$.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Galois Group**\nThe splitting field $K$ of $P(x)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is the compositum of the splitting fields of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$. Let's denote these by $K_f$ and $K_g$, respectively.\nThe splitting field of $g(x) = x^2 - 2$ is $K_g = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. The Galois group is $\\text{Gal}(K_g/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nNow we analyze $f(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$.\n*   **Irreducibility:** Using Eisenstein's criterion with the prime $p=3$:\n    *   The leading coefficient 1 is not divisible by 3.\n    *   All other coefficients (0 for $x^4$, 0 for $x^3$, 0 for $x^2$, -9 for $x$, 3 for the constant) are divisible by 3, except for the leading one.\n    *   The constant term 3 is not divisible by $3^2=9$.\n    *   Therefore, $f(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n*   **Galois Group of f(x):** Since $f(x)$ is an irreducible polynomial of degree 5, its Galois group, let's call it $G_f = \\text{Gal}(K_f/\\mathbb{Q})$, is a transitive subgroup of $S_5$.\n    To determine the group further, we find the number of real roots of $f(x)$. The derivative is $f'(x) = 5x^4 - 9$. The critical points are at $x = \\pm\\sqrt[4]{9/5}$.\n    *   At $x_0 = \\sqrt[4]{9/5}$, the local minimum value is $f(x_0) = x_0(x_0^4-9)+3 = x_0(9/5-9)+3 = -36/5 x_0 + 3$. Since $x_0 = \\sqrt[4]{1.8} > \\sqrt[4]{(15/36)^4} = 15/36 \\approx 0.41$, $f(x_0) < 0$.\n    *   At $-x_0 = -\\sqrt[4]{9/5}$, the local maximum value is $f(-x_0) = 36/5 x_0 + 3 > 0$.\n    Since the local maximum is positive and the local minimum is negative, $f(x)$ has exactly 3 real roots and 2 complex conjugate roots.\n    Complex conjugation is an automorphism in $G_f$ that swaps the two complex roots, corresponding to a transposition in $S_5$.\n    A transitive subgroup of $S_p$ (for prime $p$) that contains a transposition is the full symmetric group $S_p$. Here $p=5$, so $G_f \\cong S_5$.\n\n*   **Galois Group of P(x):** The Galois group $G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$ is a subgroup of $G_f \\times \\text{Gal}(K_g/\\mathbb{Q}) = S_5 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2$. The group $G$ is isomorphic to the direct product if and only if the intersection of the splitting fields is trivial, i.e., $K_f \\cap K_g = \\mathbb{Q}$.\n    $K_g = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ is a quadratic extension. The splitting field $K_f$ has a unique quadratic subfield, which is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{D})$, where $D$ is the discriminant of $f(x)$. The discriminant of $x^n+ax+b$ is $D = (-1)^{n(n-1)/2}(n^n b^{n-1} + (-1)^{n-1}(n-1)^{n-1}a^n)$.\n    For $f(x)=x^5-9x+3$, $n=5, a=-9, b=3$.\n    $D = (-1)^{10}(5^5 \\cdot 3^4 + (-1)^4 \\cdot 4^4 \\cdot (-9)^5) = 253125 - 15116544 = -14863419$.\n    The quadratic subfield of $K_f$ is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-14863419})$. This is an imaginary quadratic field, while $K_g=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ is a real quadratic field. Thus, their intersection is $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n    Therefore, the Galois group of $K$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is $G \\cong S_5 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2$. The order of the group is $|G| = |S_5| \\cdot |\\mathbb{Z}_2| = 120 \\cdot 2 = 240$.\n\n**Step 3: Find Degrees of Normal Subextensions**\nAccording to the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory, there is a one-to-one correspondence between intermediate fields $L$ of the extension $K/\\mathbb{Q}$ and subgroups $H$ of the Galois group $G$. The extension $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is normal if and only if the corresponding subgroup $H = \\text{Gal}(K/L)$ is a normal subgroup of $G$. The degree of the extension is $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = [G:H] = |G|/|H|$.\nWe are looking for the possible values of $[L:\\mathbb{Q}]$ for all $L$ such that $\\mathbb{Q} \\subsetneq L \\subsetneq K$. This is equivalent to finding the indices of all proper non-trivial normal subgroups of $G=S_5 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n\n**Step 4: List Normal Subgroups of $S_5 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2$**\nThe normal subgroups of $S_5$ are $\\{e\\}, A_5, S_5$. The normal subgroups of $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ are $\\{e\\}, \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\nNormal subgroups of $G$ can be of two types:\n1.  **Product Subgroups:** These are of the form $N_1 \\times N_2$, where $N_1 \\unlhd S_5$ and $N_2 \\unlhd \\mathbb{Z}_2$. The proper non-trivial ones are:\n    *   $A_5 \\times \\{e\\}$: order $60 \\times 1 = 60$.\n    *   $S_5 \\times \\{e\\}$: order $120 \\times 1 = 120$.\n    *   $\\{e\\} \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2$: order $1 \\times 2 = 2$.\n    *   $A_5 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2$: order $60 \\times 2 = 120$.\n\n2.  **Diagonal Subgroups:** These exist when there is a common quotient group. Here, $S_5/A_5 \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2$ and $\\mathbb{Z}_2/\\{e\\} \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2$. This gives rise to one more normal subgroup. Let $\\phi: S_5 \\to \\mathbb{Z}_2$ be the sign homomorphism (mapping even permutations to 0 and odd to 1). The subgroup is:\n    *   $H_{diag} = \\{(g, h) \\in S_5 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\mid h = \\phi(g)\\}$. This subgroup is isomorphic to $S_5$ and its order is 120.\n\nSo, we have five proper, non-trivial normal subgroups of $G$.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Indices (Degrees)**\nThe total order of the group is $|G| = 240$. We calculate the index for each normal subgroup:\n1.  For $H_1 = A_5 \\times \\{e\\}$, the index is $[G:H_1] = 240/60 = 4$.\n2.  For $H_2 = S_5 \\times \\{e\\}$, the index is $[G:H_2] = 240/120 = 2$.\n3.  For $H_3 = \\{e\\} \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2$, the index is $[G:H_3] = 240/2 = 120$.\n4.  For $H_4 = A_5 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2$, the index is $[G:H_4] = 240/120 = 2$.\n5.  For $H_5 = H_{diag}$, the index is $[G:H_5] = 240/120 = 2$.\n\nThe set of possible indices is $\\{2, 4, 120\\}$. These are the possible degrees of the normal field extensions $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ strictly between $\\mathbb{Q}$ and $K$.\n\nThe possible degrees are 2, 4, and 120."
