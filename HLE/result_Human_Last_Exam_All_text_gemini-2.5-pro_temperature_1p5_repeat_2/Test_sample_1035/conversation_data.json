    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the minimum number of vertices in a family of bipartite graphs covering all the edges of the complete graph $K_n$ where n = 35.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the User's Question**\n\nThe question asks for the \"minimum number of vertices in a family of bipartite graphs covering all the edges of the complete graph $K_{35}$\".\nLet the complete graph be $K_n$ on the vertex set $V$, with $|V|=n=35$.\nLet the family of bipartite graphs be $\\mathcal{F} = \\{G_1, G_2, \\ldots, G_k\\}$.\nThe condition is that the union of the edge sets of these graphs covers the edge set of $K_n$, i.e., $E(K_n) \\subseteq \\bigcup_{i=1}^k E(G_i)$.\nThe quantity to be minimized is the \"number of vertices in the family\". This is standardly interpreted as the sum of the number of vertices in each graph of the family, which is $\\sum_{i=1}^k |V(G_i)|$. Other interpretations are less likely; for instance, $|\\bigcup V(G_i)|$ would simply be $n=35$, as all vertices must be involved to cover all edges.\n\n**Step 2: Relate Covering to Partitioning**\n\nThe problem specifies a \"covering\" of edges, which means edges can be included in more than one bipartite graph in the family. We can show that the minimum cost (in terms of total vertices) for a covering is the same as for a partition (where each edge belongs to exactly one graph).\n\nConsider any covering family $\\mathcal{F} = \\{G_1, \\ldots, G_k\\}$. We can construct an edge-partition family $\\mathcal{F}' = \\{G'_1, \\ldots, G'_k\\}$ as follows: For each edge $e$ in $K_n$, assign it to exactly one graph $G_i$ from the family $\\mathcal{F}$ that contains it. Let the set of edges assigned to $G_j$ be $E(G'_j)$.\nBy construction, $\\{G'_j\\}$ forms a partition of the edges of $K_n$. Each $G'_j$ is a subgraph of the original $G_j$, so it is also bipartite. The vertex set of $G'_j$, $V(G'_j)$, is a subset of the vertex set of $G_j$ (assuming the original graphs have no isolated vertices, which is true for any minimal solution). Thus, $|V(G'_j)| \\le |V(G_j)|$.\nSumming over all graphs, we get $\\sum |V(G'_j)| \\le \\sum |V(G_j)|$.\nThis shows that for any covering, we can find a partition with an equal or smaller sum of vertices. Therefore, the minimum sum must be achieved by a partition. Our problem is now reduced to finding the minimum sum for an edge partition of $K_n$ into bipartite graphs.\n\n**Step 3: Relate Bipartite Graphs to Complete Bipartite Graphs (Bicliques)**\n\nAny bipartite graph $G_i$ with bipartition $(A_i, B_i)$ is a subgraph of the complete bipartite graph $K_{A_i, B_i}$. The number of vertices in $G_i$ is $|A_i| + |B_i|$ (again, assuming no isolated vertices). If we have a partition of $K_n$ by bipartite graphs $\\{G_i\\}$, we can consider the partition by bicliques $\\{K_{A_i, B_i}\\}$ on the same vertex partitions. The quantity we want to minimize, $\\sum |V(G_i)|$, is precisely $\\sum (|A_i|+|B_i|)$.\n\nSo the problem is equivalent to: Find the minimum value of $\\sum_{i=1}^k (|A_i| + |B_i|)$ where $\\{K_{A_i, B_i}\\}_{i=1}^k$ is a family of bicliques that partitions the edges of $K_n$.\n\n**Step 4: Apply Known Theorems from Graph Theory**\n\n1.  **Graham-Pollak Theorem:** This theorem states that the minimum number of complete bipartite subgraphs needed to partition the edges of $K_n$ is $k = n-1$. For $n=35$, we must have at least $k=34$ bipartite graphs.\n2.  **Tichy-Ticha Theorem:** A result by R. F. Tichy and H. Ticha (1982) gives the exact minimum for the quantity we are interested in. They proved that the minimum value of $\\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} (|A_i| + |B_i|)$ over all biclique partitions of $K_n$ is $\\binom{n+1}{2} - 1$.\n\n**Step 5: Use the Optimal Construction to Calculate the Sum**\n\nThe minimum value is achieved by a specific construction, often called the \"star decomposition\" or \"fan decomposition\". Let the vertices of $K_n$ be labeled $v_1, v_2, \\ldots, v_n$. The partition consists of $n-1$ bicliques:\n$G_1 = K_{\\{v_1\\}, \\{v_2, v_3, \\ldots, v_n\\}}$\n$G_2 = K_{\\{v_2\\}, \\{v_3, v_4, \\ldots, v_n\\}}$\n...\n$G_i = K_{\\{v_i\\}, \\{v_{i+1}, \\ldots, v_n\\}}$\n...\n$G_{n-1} = K_{\\{v_{n-1}\\}, \\{v_n\\}}$\n\nLet's calculate the total number of vertices for this construction:\nThe number of vertices in graph $G_i$ is $|V(G_i)| = |\\{v_i\\}| + |\\{v_{i+1}, \\ldots, v_n\\}| = 1 + (n-i) = n-i+1$.\n\nWe need to compute the sum:\n$\\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} |V(G_i)| = \\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} (n-i+1)$\nThis sum can be written as:\n$(n-1+1) + (n-2+1) + \\ldots + (n-(n-1)+1)$\n$= n + (n-1) + \\ldots + 2$\nThis is the sum of integers from 2 to $n$.\nSum $= \\left(\\sum_{j=1}^{n} j\\right) - 1 = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2} - 1$.\nThis matches the formula from the theorem, $\\binom{n+1}{2}-1$.\n\n**Step 6: Final Calculation**\n\nFor $n = 35$, the minimum number of vertices is:\n$\\frac{35 \\times (35 + 1)}{2} - 1 = \\frac{35 \\times 36}{2} - 1$\n$= 35 \\times 18 - 1$\n$= 630 - 1$\n$= 629$\n\n<<<629>>>"
