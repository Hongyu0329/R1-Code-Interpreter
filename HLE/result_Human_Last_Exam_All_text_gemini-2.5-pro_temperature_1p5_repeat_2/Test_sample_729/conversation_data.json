    "Answering this question requires understanding the structure of the generalized quaternion group and the definition of a power subgroup.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Generalized Quaternion Group Q_128**\n\nThe generalized quaternion group of order 128, denoted as $Q_{128}$, can be given by the presentation:\n$G = Q_{128} = \\langle x, y \\mid x^{64} = 1, x^{32} = y^2, y^{-1}xy = x^{-1} \\rangle$.\n\nKey properties of this group are:\n*   Its order is 128.\n*   The elements of $G$ can be written in two forms:\n    1.  $x^k$ for $0 \\le k < 64$. These elements form a cyclic subgroup $\\langle x \\rangle$ of order 64.\n    2.  $yx^k$ for $0 \\le k < 64$. These are the 64 elements outside the subgroup $\\langle x \\rangle$.\n*   The order of any element of the form $yx^k$ is 4. This can be shown by computing its square:\n    $(yx^k)^2 = yx^k yx^k = y(x^k y)x^k = y(y x^{-k})x^k = y^2 x^{-k}x^k = y^2 = x^{32}$.\n    Then $(yx^k)^4 = ((yx^k)^2)^2 = (x^{32})^2 = x^{64} = 1$.\n\n**2. Understand Power Subgroups**\n\nA subgroup $H$ of a group $G$ is called a **power subgroup** if it is the image of the $n$-th power map for some integer $n$. That is, $H$ is a power subgroup if there exists an integer $n$ such that:\n$H = G^n = \\{ g^n \\mid g \\in G \\}$\n\nOur goal is to find how many distinct subgroups can be formed this way for $G = Q_{128}$.\n\n**3. Calculate the Power Subgroups G^n**\n\nWe need to compute the set $G^n$ for an arbitrary integer $n$. We will do this by considering the two types of elements in $G$.\nThe set of $n$-th powers is:\n$G^n = \\{ (x^k)^n \\mid 0 \\le k < 64 \\} \\cup \\{ (yx^k)^n \\mid 0 \\le k < 64 \\}$\n\nWe analyze this based on the parity of $n$.\n\n**Case 1: n is even**\nLet $n = 2m$ for some integer $m$.\n*   For elements in $\\langle x \\rangle$: $(x^k)^n = (x^k)^{2m} = x^{2mk}$. The set of all such elements for $k=0, ..., 63$ generates the cyclic subgroup $\\langle x^{2m} \\rangle$. This subgroup is equal to $\\langle x^{\\gcd(2m, 64)} \\rangle$.\n*   For elements of the form $yx^k$: $(yx^k)^n = (yx^k)^{2m} = ((yx^k)^2)^m = (x^{32})^m = x^{32m}$.\nSo, when $n$ is even, $G^n = \\langle x^{2m} \\rangle \\cup \\{ x^{32m} \\}$.\nSince $32m$ is a multiple of $2m$ ($32m = 16 \\cdot 2m$), the element $x^{32m}$ is already in the subgroup $\\langle x^{2m} \\rangle$.\nThus, for any even $n$, the power subgroup is $G^n = \\langle x^n \\rangle = \\langle x^{\\gcd(n, 64)} \\rangle$.\n\nSince $n$ is even, $\\gcd(n, 64)$ must be an even divisor of 64.\nThe divisors of $64 = 2^6$ are $\\{1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64\\}$.\nThe even divisors are $\\{2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64\\}$.\nFor each of these even divisors $d$, we can find an even $n$ such that $\\gcd(n, 64)=d$ (for example, we can just take $n=d$). This gives us the following distinct power subgroups:\n1.  $\\langle x^2 \\rangle$ (order 32)\n2.  $\\langle x^4 \\rangle$ (order 16)\n3.  $\\langle x^8 \\rangle$ (order 8)\n4.  $\\langle x^{16} \\rangle$ (order 4)\n5.  $\\langle x^{32} \\rangle$ (order 2, the center of $Q_{128}$)\n6.  $\\langle x^{64} \\rangle = \\{1\\}$ (the trivial subgroup, obtained for $n=64$ or $n=0$)\n\nThis gives a total of **6** distinct power subgroups for even $n$.\n\n**Case 2: n is odd**\nLet $n = 2m+1$ for some integer $m$.\n*   For elements in $\\langle x \\rangle$: $(x^k)^n = x^{kn}$. The set of these generates $\\langle x^n \\rangle$. Since $n$ is odd, $\\gcd(n, 64)=1$. Therefore, $\\langle x^n \\rangle = \\langle x \\rangle$.\n*   For elements of the form $yx^k$: $(yx^k)^n = (yx^k)^{2m+1} = ((yx^k)^2)^m (yx^k) = (x^{32})^m yx^k = x^{32m} yx^k$.\n    Using the relation $x^{32m}y = yx^{-32m}$, we get $x^{32m}yx^k = yx^{-32m}x^k = yx^{k-32m}$.\nSo, when $n$ is odd, the set of powers is $G^n = \\langle x \\rangle \\cup \\{ yx^{k-32m} \\mid 0 \\le k < 64 \\}$.\nAs $k$ runs from 0 to 63, the expression $k-32m$ (modulo 64) also runs through all values from 0 to 63. So the second set is simply all elements not in $\\langle x \\rangle$.\nTherefore, for any odd $n$, $G^n = \\langle x \\rangle \\cup \\{ yx^j \\mid 0 \\le j < 64 \\} = G$.\nThis means that for any odd power $n$, the resulting power subgroup is the group $Q_{128}$ itself.\n\nThis gives **1** more distinct power subgroup.\n\n**4. Final Count**\n\nWe have found the complete set of distinct power subgroups of $Q_{128}$:\n1.  The 6 cyclic subgroups obtained from even powers: $\\{1\\}, \\langle x^{32} \\rangle, \\langle x^{16} \\rangle, \\langle x^8 \\rangle, \\langle x^4 \\rangle, \\langle x^2 \\rangle$.\n2.  The group $Q_{128}$ itself, obtained from any odd power.\n\nThese are all distinct. The first 6 are proper cyclic subgroups, while $Q_{128}$ is non-cyclic. The 6 cyclic subgroups are also distinct from each other as they have different orders.\n\nTotal number of power subgroups = 6 (from even powers) + 1 (from odd powers) = 7.\n\nThe power subgroups are: $\\{ Q_{128}, \\langle x^2 \\rangle, \\langle x^4 \\rangle, \\langle x^8 \\rangle, \\langle x^{16} \\rangle, \\langle x^{32} \\rangle, \\{1\\} \\}$.\n\nThere are 7 such subgroups."
