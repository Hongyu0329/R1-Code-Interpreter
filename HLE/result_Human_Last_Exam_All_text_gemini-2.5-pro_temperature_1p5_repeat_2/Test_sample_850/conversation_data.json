    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the crystal classes that are achiral, non-polar, and have the correct symmetry for optical activity.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Key Properties\n\nFirst, we need to clearly define the three properties required by the question in the context of crystal symmetry (point groups).\n\n*   **Achiral:** An object is achiral if it is superimposable on its mirror image. In terms of symmetry, a crystal class is achiral if its point group contains at least one rotoinversion operation (an improper rotation). The rotoinversion axes are denoted as $\\bar{n}$. These include a center of inversion ($\\bar{1}$) and a mirror plane ($m$, which is equivalent to $\\bar{2}$). The 11 crystal classes that *lack* any rotoinversion operations are called chiral (or enantiomorphic). The remaining 21 classes are achiral.\n*   **Non-polar:** A crystal class is non-polar if it does not have any unique polar axes. A polar axis is a direction in the crystal where the two ends are not equivalent by any symmetry operation. The presence of a polar axis leads to properties like pyroelectricity. There are 10 polar crystal classes: 1, 2, m, mm2, 3, 3m, 4, 4mm, 6, 6mm. A non-polar class is any class not on this list.\n*   **Optical Activity:** This is the phenomenon where a material rotates the plane of polarization of light. The physical property is described by the gyration tensor ($g_{ij}$). According to Neumann's Principle, the symmetry of a crystal's physical properties must include the symmetry of the crystal's point group. It has been shown that the gyration tensor must be zero for any crystal class that possesses a **center of inversion ($\\bar{1}$)** or a **mirror plane ($m$)**. Therefore, for a crystal class to have the correct symmetry for optical activity, it must *not* contain a center of inversion or a mirror plane.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Optical Activity vs. Chirality:** It is a common misconception to equate optical activity with chirality. While all 11 chiral classes are optically active, the reverse is not strictly true. The fundamental requirement for optical activity is the absence of a center of symmetry ($\\bar{1}$) and mirror planes ($m$). An achiral crystal class could potentially be optically active if its achirality arises from a rotoinversion axis other than $\\bar{1}$ or $m$.\n2.  **Implications of Rotoinversion Axes:** The question asks for a class that is achiral *and* optically active. This means it must contain a rotoinversion axis ($\\bar{n}$), but this axis cannot be $\\bar{1}$ or $m$. We must examine the other rotoinversion axes: $\\bar{3}$, $\\bar{4}$, and $\\bar{6}$.\n    *   A $\\bar{3}$ axis is equivalent to a 3-fold rotation plus a center of inversion ($3 + \\bar{1}$). Thus, any class with $\\bar{3}$ as its highest symmetry (like class $\\bar{3}$) is centrosymmetric and not optically active.\n    *   A $\\bar{6}$ axis is equivalent to a 3-fold axis with a perpendicular mirror plane ($3/m$). Thus, any class with a $\\bar{6}$ axis (like class $\\bar{6}$) contains a mirror plane and is not optically active.\n    *   A $\\bar{4}$ axis does not, by itself, imply the presence of a center of inversion or a mirror plane. This makes it a candidate for creating a class that is achiral yet optically active.\n\n### Step 2: Systematic Filtering of Crystal Classes\n\nWe will now use the three conditions to filter the 32 crystal classes.\n\n1.  **Condition: Achiral.** We start by listing all 21 achiral crystal classes:\n    $\\bar{1}$, $m$, $2/m$, $mm2$, $mmm$, $\\bar{4}$, $4/m$, $4mm$, $\\bar{4}2m$, $4/mmm$, $\\bar{3}$, $3m$, $\\bar{3}m$, $\\bar{6}$, $6/m$, $6mm$, $\\bar{6}m2$, $6/mmm$, $m\\bar{3}$, $\\bar{4}3m$, $m\\bar{3}m$.\n\n2.  **Condition: Non-polar.** From the list above, we remove the polar classes. The achiral polar classes are $m$, $mm2$, $4mm$, $3m$, and $6mm$. Removing these leaves the following list of **achiral and non-polar** classes:\n    $\\bar{1}$, $2/m$, $mmm$, $\\bar{4}$, $4/m$, $\\bar{4}2m$, $4/mmm$, $\\bar{3}$, $\\bar{3}m$, $\\bar{6}$, $6/m$, $\\bar{6}m2$, $6/mmm$, $m\\bar{3}$, $\\bar{4}3m$, $m\\bar{3}m$.\n\n3.  **Condition: Symmetry for Optical Activity.** From this new list, we must remove any class that contains a center of inversion ($\\bar{1}$) or a mirror plane ($m$).\n    *   Classes with a center of inversion (centrosymmetric): $\\bar{1}$, $2/m$, $mmm$, $4/m$, $4/mmm$, $\\bar{3}$, $\\bar{3}m$, $6/m$, $6/mmm$, $m\\bar{3}$, $m\\bar{3}m$. (All of these are eliminated).\n    *   Classes with mirror planes ($m$): In addition to the centrosymmetric classes (most of which also have mirror planes), we must eliminate the remaining non-centrosymmetric classes if they have mirror planes: $\\bar{4}2m$, $\\bar{6}$ (is $3/m$), $\\bar{6}m2$, $\\bar{4}3m$. (All of these are eliminated).\n\n### Step 3: Final Answer Derivation\n\nAfter applying all three filters, only one crystal class from the original 32 remains. Let's re-examine it to be sure.\n\n*   **Crystal Class: $\\bar{4}$** (Schoenflies symbol $S_4$)\n    *   **Achiral?** Yes, it contains a $\\bar{4}$ rotoinversion axis.\n    *   **Non-polar?** Yes, it is not one of the 10 polar classes.\n    *   **Optically Active?** Yes. Its symmetry elements are {$1, \\bar{4}, 2, \\bar{4}^3$}. It has no center of inversion ($\\bar{1}$) and no mirror planes ($m$). Therefore, the gyration tensor is non-zero, and it has the correct symmetry to exhibit optical activity.\n\nThus, there is exactly one crystal class that fulfills all the conditions.\n\n<<<Crystal class $\\bar{4}$ (in the Tetragonal system)>>>"
