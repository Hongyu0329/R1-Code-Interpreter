    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the equation to find the solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Equation**\nThe equation given is `XXIV/LXXV - CMXLIX = ?`.\nThis is a mathematical expression that uses Roman numerals for the numbers and standard symbols for the operations of division (`/`) and subtraction (`-`). The task is to calculate the result and express it in modern numbers.\n\n**Step 2: Convert Roman Numerals to Modern Numbers**\nWe need to convert each Roman numeral into its modern Arabic numeral equivalent.\n\n*   **XXIV**:\n    *   `XX` represents 20 (10 + 10).\n    *   `IV` represents 4 (5 - 1).\n    *   Therefore, `XXIV` = 20 + 4 = **24**.\n\n*   **LXXV**:\n    *   `L` represents 50.\n    *   `XX` represents 20 (10 + 10).\n    *   `V` represents 5.\n    *   Therefore, `LXXV` = 50 + 20 + 5 = **75**.\n\n*   **CMXLIX**:\n    *   `CM` represents 900 (1000 - 100).\n    *   `XL` represents 40 (50 - 10).\n    *   `IX` represents 9 (10 - 1).\n    *   Therefore, `CMXLIX` = 900 + 40 + 9 = **949**.\n\n**Step 3: Rewrite the Equation with Modern Numbers**\nSubstituting the converted values into the original equation, we get:\n`24 / 75 - 949 = ?`\n\n**Step 4: Solve the Equation Following the Order of Operations**\nAccording to the standard order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS), division must be performed before subtraction.\n\n*   **Part 1: Division**\n    *   Calculate `24 / 75`.\n    *   This fraction can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 3.\n    *   `24 ÷ 3 = 8`\n    *   `75 ÷ 3 = 25`\n    *   So, the fraction is `8 / 25`.\n    *   To express this as a decimal, we can convert the fraction to have a denominator of 100: `(8 × 4) / (25 × 4) = 32 / 100 = 0.32`.\n\n*   **Part 2: Subtraction**\n    *   Now, subtract 949 from the result of the division.\n    *   `0.32 - 949 = -948.68`\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Roman Numeral Accuracy**: It is crucial to correctly interpret the Roman numerals, especially the subtractive notation where a smaller numeral placed before a larger one indicates subtraction (e.g., `IV`, `IX`, `XL`, `CM`).\n2.  **Order of Operations**: The order of operations is critical. Performing subtraction before division (`75 - 949`) would lead to a completely different and incorrect answer. The expression must be evaluated as `(24 / 75) - 949`.\n3.  **Modern Mathematics**: The problem uses an ancient number system but is presented as a modern arithmetic problem. Therefore, modern mathematical rules apply, including the use of decimal fractions and negative numbers, as confirmed by the instruction to \"Answer using modern numbers\".\n\nThe final solution is the result of this calculation.\n\n<<<-948.68>>>"
