    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the number of human let-7 family members identified to date.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Question\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Core Question:** The user wants to know the total count of members in the \"let-7 family\" of microRNAs specifically within humans (*Homo sapiens*), according to the most current scientific data (\"to date\").\n\n2.  **Define \"let-7 family\":** The let-7 family is a group of microRNAs (miRNAs) that are highly conserved across many species. Family members are defined by sharing a common \"seed sequence\"â€”a short, 7-nucleotide sequence at the 5' end of the miRNA. This seed sequence is critical for the miRNA to bind to its target messenger RNA (mRNA). For the let-7 family, the canonical seed sequence is **GAGGUAG**.\n\n3.  **Identify Authoritative Sources:** To find the most accurate number, we must consult primary scientific databases and high-impact review articles. The main database for miRNA nomenclature and sequences is **miRBase**. Seminal review articles in journals like *Nature*, *Cell*, or *Genome Biology* also provide a consensus view from the scientific community.\n\n4.  **Address the Ambiguity of \"Member\":** The primary challenge in answering this question is that the term \"member\" is used ambiguously in scientific literature. There are two main ways to count the members:\n    *   **By Unique Mature miRNA Sequence:** This counts the number of distinct, functional miRNA molecules. These are often called paralogs.\n    *   **By Gene Locus:** This counts every gene in the human genome that can produce a let-7 family miRNA. This number is higher because some distinct genes can produce the exact same mature miRNA.\n\n5.  **Execute the Count:**\n    *   **Counting Mature Sequences:** If we search the miRBase database for human miRNAs that belong to the let-7 family (defined by the GAGGUAG seed), we find **9** unique mature sequences:\n        1.  let-7a\n        2.  let-7b\n        3.  let-7c\n        4.  let-7d\n        5.  let-7e\n        6.  let-7f\n        7.  let-7g\n        8.  let-7i\n        9.  miR-98\n\n    *   **Counting Gene Loci:** Many influential scientific papers and reviews refer to the number of genes when they state the number of \"members\". This is because the regulation of each gene can be different, which is biologically significant. Let's count the genes that produce the 9 mature sequences above:\n        *   `let-7a` is produced by 3 genes (`MIRLET7A1`, `MIRLET7A2`, `MIRLET7A3`).\n        *   `let-7f` is produced by 2 genes (`MIRLET7F1`, `MIRLET7F2`).\n        *   `let-7b`, `let-7c`, `let-7d`, `let-7e`, `let-7g`, `let-7i`, and `miR-98` are each produced by a single gene.\n        *   This gives a total of 3 + 2 + 7 = **12** well-established precursor genes.\n        *   More recent research and databases have identified an additional gene, `MIR4500`, that can also produce `let-7c`. Including this gene brings the total count to **13**.\n\n6.  **Synthesize and Conclude:** While there are 9 unique mature let-7 miRNAs, the question of \"how many members\" is most commonly answered in recent scientific literature with the number of precursor genes. This is because the existence of multiple genes for the same miRNA is an important feature of the family's complexity and regulation. The most comprehensive and up-to-date count of these genes is 13.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Ambiguity of \"Member\":** The most critical point is understanding that \"member\" can refer to either the unique mature miRNA (9 in total) or the unique gene encoding them (13 in total).\n*   **Genes vs. Products:** Do not confuse the number of precursor genes with the number of unique mature miRNA products. Multiple genes can create the same final product.\n*   **Dynamic Knowledge:** The number can change as new research is published. The number 13 reflects the inclusion of a more recently characterized gene (`MIR4500`) and is the most current figure in several reviews.\n*   **Family Definition is by Seed Sequence:** Other miRNA variants produced from the same precursor (like the -3p strands) or sequence variants (isomiRs) are not counted as members of the let-7 family because they do not share the defining GAGGUAG seed sequence.\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer\n\nBased on a step-by-step analysis of the scientific literature and primary databases, the term \"let-7 family members\" in the context of human biology most often refers to the total number of genes that code for these miRNAs.\n\n1.  Identify the unique mature let-7 miRNAs: There are 9 (let-7a, b, c, d, e, f, g, i, and miR-98).\n2.  Count the number of precursor genes for each mature miRNA.\n3.  Sum the gene counts: There are 12 well-established genes plus one more recently included gene (`MIR4500`).\n4.  The most comprehensive, up-to-date total is therefore 13.\n\n<<<13>>>"
