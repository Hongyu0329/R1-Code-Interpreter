    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the core elements of the question.**\nThe question asks to identify a specific character from the 1972 Andrei Tarkovsky film *Solaris*. The key identifying feature of this character is the specific sentiment of being \"ashamed to miss the sound of leaves rustling on Earth.\"\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the provided character options.**\n*   **A. Kris Kelvin:** The protagonist. He is a psychologist sent to the space station. The film begins and ends with him on Earth, surrounded by nature. While he deeply values Earth, he has just arrived at the station, so the long-term sense of shame from being homesick has not yet set in for him in the same way as for the other crew members.\n*   **B. Hari:** She is a \"guest\" or \"visitor,\" a physical manifestation of Kris's memory of his dead wife, created by the sentient ocean of Solaris. As a non-human entity who has never truly lived on Earth, she cannot be homesick for it in the way a human would be.\n*   **C. Snaut:** A cyberneticist who has been on the Solaris station for a long time. He is weary, cynical, and philosophical. He often engages Kris in deep conversations about humanity, space exploration, and the nature of their predicament.\n*   **D. Sartorius:** A biologist, another long-term resident of the station. He is portrayed as cold, rigidly scientific, and almost inhumanly detached. He is focused on studying Solaris and shows contempt for emotional displays, which he sees as weakness.\n*   **E. Gibarian:** A physiologist who was Kris's friend. He commits suicide just before Kris arrives at the station. Kris only interacts with him through a final video message, in which Gibarian is clearly distressed and despairing.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate which character's personality and dialogue align with the quote.**\nThe sentiment of being \"ashamed\" to miss something as simple as rustling leaves suggests a complex inner state. It's not just homesickness; it's a feeling of professional or existential failureâ€”that as an explorer of new worlds, one should be above such terrestrial longings.\n\n*   This emotion does not fit Sartorius, who would likely suppress or deny such feelings rather than confessing shame over them.\n*   It does not fit Hari, who is not a human from Earth in this context.\n*   It does not fit Kris, who has just left Earth.\n*   The line is spoken during a live conversation, so it cannot be from Gibarian's final video message.\n\nThis leaves Snaut. His character is the most introspective and talkative about the psychological toll of their mission. In a notable scene, he has a conversation with Kris where he reflects on the true reasons for humanity's presence in space. He confesses that they are ashamed of their deep-seated homesickness, specifically mentioning missing the sounds of Earth, like the rustling of leaves. This line perfectly encapsulates his world-weariness and his philosophical grappling with their isolation and lost connection to their home.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude based on the analysis.**\nThe character who expresses shame for missing the sound of rustling leaves is Dr. Snaut. The line is a direct quote from his dialogue in the film, highlighting the theme of humanity's inescapable connection to Earth, even when exploring the vastness of the cosmos.\n\n<<<C>>>"
