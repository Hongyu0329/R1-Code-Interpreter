    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the puzzle:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Title and the Core Question**\nThe haiku's title is \"The Bays\". The problem states that \"The title is a question\". This strongly suggests a pun or a homophone.\n-   \"The Bays\" sounds identical to \"Thebes\", the ancient Greek city.\n-   Therefore, the question being asked is related to the mythology of Thebes.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Haiku Clues**\nThe haiku itself is a riddle, with each line providing a clue to the answer.\n\n*   **Clue 1: \"An August tempest\"**\n    *   \"August\" means majestic, revered, or grand.\n    *   \"Tempest\" means a violent storm or great turmoil.\n    *   In the context of Thebes, this perfectly describes the tragic hero Oedipus. He became a revered king (\"August\"), but his life and reign were defined by catastrophic revelations and turmoil (\"tempest\").\n\n*   **Clue 2: \"Twice fifteen brings winds of change\"**\n    *   \"Twice fifteen\" is a mathematical phrase meaning `2 x 15 = 30`.\n    *   We must find the significance of the number 30 in this context. Thirty years is commonly used to represent the span of a single human generation.\n    *   The phrase \"brings winds of change\" is a common idiom. A new generation inherently brings change to a society.\n    *   This line connects the number 30 to generational change.\n\n*   **Clue 3: \"A divine one yields\"**\n    *   This is the most direct clue related to the myth of Oedipus and Thebes.\n    *   Before entering Thebes, Oedipus confronted the Sphinx, a creature with a human head on a lion's body, sent by the gods to terrorize the city. The Sphinx is the \"divine one\".\n    *   The Sphinx posed a riddle to all travelers, and when Oedipus answered it correctly, she \"yields\" by throwing herself from her cliff to her death.\n\n**Step 3: Synthesize the Clues to Find the Solution**\nThe haiku is a riddle that points to the answer of the Sphinx's own riddle.\n1.  The Sphinx (\"a divine one\") yields to the person who solves her riddle.\n2.  The solution to the riddle allowed Oedipus (\"an August tempest\") to enter Thebes, bringing \"winds of change\".\n3.  The Sphinx's riddle asks what walks on four legs, then two, then three. The answer is **MAN**, representing the stages of human life from crawling baby to two-legged adult to an elder using a cane.\n4.  The answer \"MAN\" fits all the clues from our haiku: the haiku discusses a human figure (Oedipus), the concept of a generation (\"twice fifteen\"), and the yielding of a divine creature to this solution.\n\n**Step 4: Interpret the Final Instruction**\nThe final part of the question is, \"in alphabetical order what is the answer?\". This is a final instruction on how to format the solution word.\n-   The answer word is **MAN**.\n-   The letters in this word are M, A, N.\n-   Placing these letters in alphabetical order, we get A, M, N.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n1.  The title \"The Bays\" must be recognized as a homophone for \"Thebes\".\n2.  Each line of the haiku is a distinct but related clue pointing to a single concept.\n3.  The phrase \"Twice fifteen\" is not arbitrary; its product, 30, must be connected to the theme of the riddle (a human generation), which links to the answer of the Sphinx's riddle (Man).\n4.  The final answer requires performing the action described in the last instruction (\"in alphabetical order\") upon the solved word.\n\nCombining all steps, the final answer is derived from the word MAN, with its letters sorted alphabetically.\n\n<<<AMN>>>"
