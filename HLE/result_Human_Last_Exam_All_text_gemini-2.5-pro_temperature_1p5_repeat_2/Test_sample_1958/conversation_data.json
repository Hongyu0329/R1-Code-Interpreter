    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the correct answer.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Question and Identify Key Constraints\n\nThe question asks for four specific things:\n1.  A book of the Bible.\n2.  It must be the *first* one mentioned in a Shakespeare play when the books of the Bible are arranged in *canonical order*.\n3.  The book must be mentioned *by name* (e.g., \"Genesis,\" \"Psalms\"), not just alluded to through a story or character (like Adam, Noah, or Job).\n4.  The name of the Shakespeare play in which this mention occurs.\n\n### Step 2: List All the Careful Points\n\nTo answer this correctly, we must be careful about several points:\n\n*   **Canonical Order:** This refers to the standard sequence of the books in the Bible. For Shakespeare's context, the Protestant canon is the most relevant. The order of the Old Testament begins: Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, Joshua, Judges, Ruth, 1 & 2 Samuel, 1 & 2 Kings, 1 & 2 Chronicles, Ezra, Nehemiah, Esther, Job, **Psalms**, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, etc.\n*   **Mentioned \"By Name\":** This is the most critical constraint. Simply referring to a story from Genesis (like Cain and Abel) does not count. The word \"Genesis\" itself must appear in the text and refer to the book. Similarly, a character might be described as having \"the patience of Job,\" which refers to the character, but the play must mention \"the Book of Job\" or \"Job\" in a context that clearly means the book.\n*   **Common Words:** Some book titles are also common English words, such as \"Judges,\" \"Kings,\" \"Numbers,\" or \"Lamentations.\" We must verify that the context of the mention refers to the biblical book and not just the common meaning of the word. For example, a line about \"the king's judges\" would not count as a mention of the books of Kings and Judges.\n*   **Source Text:** The analysis must be based on the established texts of Shakespeare's plays.\n\n### Step 3: Acquiring the Final Answer with Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nWe will proceed through the books of the Old Testament in canonical order, searching for the first one that is named in a Shakespeare play.\n\n1.  **Genesis to Job:** There are countless allusions to the stories and characters from the early books of the Bible (Adam, Eve, Cain, Noah, the Tower of Babel, Abraham, Jacob, Joseph, Samson, Job, etc.). However, a search of Shakespeare's complete works reveals that the *names* of the books themselves—**Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, Joshua, Judges, Ruth, Samuel, Kings, Chronicles, Ezra, Nehemiah, Esther, and Job**—are not mentioned as titles of books. Common words like \"judges\" and \"kings\" appear, but not in reference to the biblical texts.\n\n2.  **Psalms:** The next book in canonical order is the Book of Psalms. We search for a mention of this book by name. We find a definitive mention in the play *The Merry Wives of Windsor*.\n\n    *   **Play:** *The Merry Wives of Windsor* (Act 2, Scene 1)\n    *   **Context:** Mistress Ford and Mistress Page are comparing the identical love letters they have received from Falstaff. Mistress Ford expresses her shock that a man who seemed so pious could be so lecherous.\n    *   **The Quote:** She remarks that Falstaff's disposition seemed so moralistic that she would have expected him to turn to religious texts, not lustful pursuits:\n        > \"and yet he would not swear; praised women's modesty; and gave such orderly and well-behaved reproof to all uncomeliness, that I would have sworn his disposition would have gone to **the psalms, to the proverbs**, with all his heart: and now he is turned orthography; his words are a very fantastical banquet, just so many strange dishes.\"\n\n3.  **Conclusion of Analysis:** This quote explicitly names two books of the Bible: \"the psalms\" and \"the proverbs.\" According to canonical order, the Book of Psalms comes before the Book of Proverbs. Since no preceding book of the Bible is mentioned by name in any of Shakespeare's plays, the Book of Psalms is the first.\n\n4.  **Verifying Other Potential Candidates:**\n    *   **New Testament:** Books like the Gospels and various Epistles (e.g., Corinthians) are also mentioned or alluded to. For example, Prince Hal refers to Falstaff's companions as \"Ephesians\" and a traveler is called a \"Corinthian\" (*1 Henry IV*), but these are used as slang for merry-makers, not direct references to the Epistles. The Gospels are referenced, for instance, when a character swears an oath on them. However, all New Testament books come after Psalms in the full biblical canon, so Psalms remains the first.\n\nTherefore, the first book of the Bible mentioned by name in canonical order is the Book of Psalms, and it is mentioned in *The Merry Wives of Windsor*.\n\n<<<The Book of Psalms, in *The Merry Wives of Windsor*>>>"
