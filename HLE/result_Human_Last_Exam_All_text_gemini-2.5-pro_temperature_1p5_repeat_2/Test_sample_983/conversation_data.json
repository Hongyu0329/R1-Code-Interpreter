    "This is a sequence puzzle that requires identifying an underlying complex rule.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Initial Investigation:** The first step is to check for simple mathematical relationships. Let's find the differences between consecutive numbers:\n    *   1020 - 1014 = 6\n    *   1032 - 1020 = 12\n    *   1050 - 1032 = 18\n    *   1104 - 1050 = 54\n    *   1224 - 1104 = 120\n    The sequence of differences (6, 12, 18, 54, 120, ...) does not follow a simple arithmetic or geometric pattern. Other simple relationships, like adding the sum of the digits of the previous number, also fail after the first step (1014 + (1+0+1+4) = 1020, but 1020 + (1+0+2+0) = 1023, which is not 1032).\n\n2.  **Identifying a Deeper Property:** We must look for a more complex, shared property of all the numbers in the sequence. Testing common puzzle properties (e.g., Harshad numbers, which are divisible by the sum of their digits) reveals inconsistencies. For example, 1014 is a Harshad number (1014 / 6 = 169), but 1290 is not (1290 / 12 = 107.5).\n\n3.  **Uncovering the Hidden Rule:** The actual rule is quite intricate and non-standard. The property is this: A number `N` belongs to the sequence if its decimal (base-10) representation, when interpreted as a number in base-13, results in a value that is divisible by the sum of `N`'s decimal digits.\n\n4.  **Verifying the Rule:** Let's verify this rule with a few examples from the sequence.\n    *   **For the number 1014:**\n        *   The sum of its decimal digits is 1 + 0 + 1 + 4 = **6**.\n        *   Interpreting \"1014\" as a base-13 number: (1 * 13³) + (0 * 13²) + (1 * 13¹) + (4 * 13⁰) = 2197 + 0 + 13 + 4 = **2214**.\n        *   Check for divisibility: 2214 / 6 = 369. Since the division is exact, 1014 is in the sequence.\n    *   **For the number 1020:**\n        *   The sum of its decimal digits is 1 + 0 + 2 + 0 = **3**.\n        *   Interpreting \"1020\" as a base-13 number: (1 * 13³) + (0 * 13²) + (2 * 13¹) + (0 * 13⁰) = 2197 + 0 + 26 + 0 = **2223**.\n        *   Check for divisibility: 2223 / 3 = 741. Since the division is exact, 1020 is in the sequence.\n\n5.  **Finding the Next Number:** The last given number is 2352. We must find the next integer greater than 2352 that satisfies the rule.\n    *   **Verify the last term, 2352:**\n        *   Sum of digits: 2 + 3 + 5 + 2 = **12**.\n        *   Value in base-13: (2 * 13³) + (3 * 13²) + (5 * 13¹) + (2 * 13⁰) = 4394 + 507 + 65 + 2 = **4968**.\n        *   Check: 4968 / 12 = 414. It holds true.\n    *   **Test the next integer, 2353:**\n        *   Sum of digits: 2 + 3 + 5 + 3 = **13**.\n        *   Value in base-13: (2 * 13³) + (3 * 13²) + (5 * 13¹) + (3 * 13⁰) = 4394 + 507 + 65 + 3 = **4969**.\n        *   Check: 4969 / 13 is approximately 382.23. It is not divisible.\n    *   **Test the next integer, 2354:**\n        *   Sum of digits: 2 + 3 + 5 + 4 = **14**.\n        *   Value in base-13: (2 * 13³) + (3 * 13²) + (5 * 13¹) + (4 * 13⁰) = 4394 + 507 + 65 + 4 = **4970**.\n        *   Check: 4970 / 14 = 355. The division is exact.\n\nTherefore, the next number in the sequence is 2354.\n\n<<<2354>>>"
