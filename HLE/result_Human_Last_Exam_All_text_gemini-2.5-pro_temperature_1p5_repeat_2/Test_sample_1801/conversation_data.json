    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The core of the question is to identify two specific individuals who meet several criteria:\n    *   They are Nobel laureates.\n    *   They were featured in a commercial for the company Enron.\n    *   The commercial aired in or around the year 2000.\n    *   The commercial's prominent tagline was \"Ask Why\".\n\n2.  **Research the Enron \"Ask Why\" Campaign:**\n    *   In 2000, Enron, then a seemingly successful energy and commodities company, launched a major corporate image advertising campaign.\n    *   The agency was Ogilvy & Mather. The campaign's goal was to position Enron not as a simple energy company, but as a revolutionary, idea-driven corporation that was changing the world.\n    *   The tagline \"Ask Why\" was meant to evoke curiosity, innovation, and a challenge to the status quo. This is deeply ironic in hindsight, as the company collapsed in 2001 due to massive accounting fraud that involved hiding debt and fabricating profits.\n\n3.  **Identify the Personalities Featured:**\n    *   The campaign featured a series of commercials with various thought leaders and public figures. The goal was to associate the Enron brand with intelligence and forward-thinking.\n    *   Research into this specific campaign reveals that two prominent economists were featured in one of the most noted commercials.\n\n4.  **Identify the First Nobel Laureate: Myron Scholes**\n    *   **Careful Point:** Myron Scholes was one of the individuals in the commercial. We must verify his Nobel status relative to the commercial's air date.\n    *   Myron Scholes was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in **1997** for the Black-Scholes model, a method for pricing financial derivatives.\n    *   Therefore, at the time of the commercial in 2000, he was already a Nobel laureate.\n\n5.  **Identify the Second Nobel Laureate: Paul Krugman**\n    *   **Careful Point:** Paul Krugman was the other economist featured. Again, we must verify his Nobel status relative to the commercial's air date.\n    *   Paul Krugman was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in **2008** for his work on New Trade Theory and New Economic Geography.\n    *   Crucially, this means that in 2000, when the commercial aired, Paul Krugman was a prominent economist and columnist, but **not yet** a Nobel laureate. The question asks which two \"Nobel laureates\" were featured, which is correct in retrospect, as both individuals eventually held the prize. This nuance is a key part of the question's infamy.\n\n6.  **Synthesize the Findings:**\n    *   The two individuals featured in the infamous 2000 Enron \"Ask Why\" commercial were Myron Scholes and Paul Krugman.\n    *   Myron Scholes was a Nobel laureate at the time.\n    *   Paul Krugman became a Nobel laureate eight years after the commercial aired.\n    *   The appearance of these two highly respected economists was intended to lend immense credibility to Enron's brand image, an image that would be shattered by scandal just a year later.\n\n### Final Answer\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the two individuals who are Nobel laureates and were featured in the commercial are identified.\n\n<<<Paul Krugman and Myron Scholes>>>"
