    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The core of the question is to identify a specific scientific genus of mushroom. The key characteristic given is that it is the *only* genus known to produce a \"distinctly blue spore print\".\n\n2.  **Define Spore Print:** A spore print is a crucial identification tool in mycology. It is made by placing a mushroom cap, gills or pores down, on a surface (usually paper) and allowing the mature spores to fall and create a pattern. The color of this deposit is the spore print color. The primary colors for spore prints are white, cream, yellow, pink/salmon, rusty brown, dark brown, purple-brown, and black.\n\n3.  **Investigate the \"Blue Spore Print\" Claim:** From a scientific, mycological standpoint, a \"distinctly blue\" spore print is not a recognized category. True blue pigments are exceptionally rare in fungal spores. This suggests the question might be a trick question or based on a common misconception.\n\n4.  **Evaluate Common \"Blue\" Mushroom Candidates:** Several genera are famous for their blue coloration, leading many to incorrectly assume they have blue spores. Let's analyze them:\n    *   **Genus *Entoloma***: This genus includes some spectacularly blue mushrooms, most famously *Entoloma hochstetteri*. However, the defining feature of the *Entoloma* genus is its pink to salmon-pink spore print.\n    *   **Genus *Gyroporus***: This genus contains the species *Gyroporus cyanescens*, known as the \"bluing bolete,\" because its flesh rapidly bruises a deep blue when cut or damaged. However, its spore print is pale yellow.\n    *   **Genus *Lactarius***: This is the most likely source of the misconception. The species *Lactarius indigo* is a striking blue mushroom. When it is cut, it exudes a bright blue latex (or \"milk\"). This blue latex can drip onto a surface and stain it blue, which is easily mistaken for a spore print. However, the actual spore print of *Lactarius indigo* is yellowish-cream.\n\n5.  **Synthesize the Findings:** There is no mushroom genus that is scientifically accepted as producing a distinctly blue spore print. The question's premise is flawed. However, such questions often appear in trivia and rely on popular misconceptions. The most famous \"blue\" mushroom, whose blue feature (the latex) is most likely to be confused with a spore print, is *Lactarius indigo*.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** The question is a classic trick question. The genus most famously associated with a distinct blue color that is often confused for a spore print is *Lactarius*.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe genus known for a mushroom (*Lactarius indigo*) that produces a blue latex often mistaken for a blue spore print is *Lactarius*.\n\n<<<Lactarius>>>"
