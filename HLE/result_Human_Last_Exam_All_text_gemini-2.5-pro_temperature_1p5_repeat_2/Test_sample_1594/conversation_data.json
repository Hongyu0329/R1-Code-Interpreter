    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the letter formed by the school buildings.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Subjects:** The question asks about two specific high schools in Pisa, Italy: the \"Istituto Galilei-Pacinotti\" and the \"Istituto Ulisse Dini\".\n2.  **Confirm Location:** Using a map service like Google Maps, we can search for these two schools. We find that the Liceo Scientifico \"Ulisse Dini\" and the Istituto Tecnico Industriale \"G. Galilei\" and Istituto Professionale \"A. Pacinotti\" (which are often referred to collectively) are located right next to each other, sharing a large campus on Via Benedetto Croce in Pisa.\n3.  **Use Aerial View:** To see the shape the buildings form \"from above,\" we must use the satellite view on the map service.\n4.  **Analyze the Building Shapes:**\n    *   We can see a long, main building that runs vertically (north-south). This building belongs primarily to the Liceo Dini and forms the \"spine\" of the letter.\n    *   Extending horizontally (eastward) from this vertical spine are three distinct wings or buildings:\n        *   A shorter wing near the top (north end).\n        *   Another shorter wing in the middle.\n        *   A long, slightly curved building at the bottom (south end), which is the main building of the Istituto Galilei-Pacinotti.\n5.  **Identify the Letter:** When you combine the vertical spine with the three horizontal extensions, the resulting shape is clearly identifiable. The vertical spine with the three horizontal bars extending in the same direction forms the capital letter **E**.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   It is the **combination** of the buildings of both schools that creates the shape, not just one of them.\n*   The lines are not perfectly straight as in a typed letter, but the overall architectural layout is unmistakable from an aerial perspective.\n*   The \"bottom\" bar of the E (the Galilei-Pacinotti building) is noticeably longer and slightly curved compared to the top two bars.\n*   The standard \"north-is-up\" map orientation is necessary to see the letter correctly.\n\n<<<E>>>"
