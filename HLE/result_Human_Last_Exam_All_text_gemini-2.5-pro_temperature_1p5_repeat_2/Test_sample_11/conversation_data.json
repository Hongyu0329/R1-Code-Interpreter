    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the first statute in the modern State of Israel to explicitly introduce the concept of \"good faith\".\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Jurisdiction and Timeframe:** The question specifies the \"modern State of Israel,\" which means we are looking at laws passed after its establishment in 1948.\n    *   **Core Concept:** The key term is \"good faith.\" In Hebrew, this is \"תום לב\" (*tom lev*).\n    *   **Requirement:** We need the *first* statute that *explicitly* uses this term. This means the words \"good faith\" or \"תום לב\" must appear in the text of the law itself, not just be a principle applied by courts when interpreting the law.\n    *   **Exclusion:** We must not confuse the first introduction of the term with the statute that made it a famous, overarching principle of the legal system.\n\n2.  **Initial Brainstorming and Common Misconceptions:**\n    *   The most famous Israeli law regarding good faith is the **Contracts (General Part) Law, 1973**. Its sections 12 (good faith in negotiation) and 39 (good faith in performance of a contract) are cornerstones of Israeli civil law. Many would instinctively point to this law.\n    *   However, the question asks for the *first* statute, so the 1973 law is a late candidate. We must check for earlier legislation.\n\n3.  **Investigating Pre-1973 Legislation (Working Backwards):**\n    *   **Land Law, 1969:** Section 10 of this law discusses the rights of someone who acquired property \"in good faith\" (*בתום-לב*) and for consideration. This predates the Contracts Law.\n    *   **Agency Law, 1965:** Section 8(a) of this law explicitly states that an agent owes a duty of loyalty to the principal and must act \"in good faith\" (*בתום לב*) in carrying out their duties. This is earlier than the Land Law.\n    *   **Bills of Exchange Ordinance [New Version], 1957:** This ordinance, which replaced the British Mandate-era law, defines a \"holder in due course.\" Section 29(a)(1) requires that the person took the bill \"in good faith\" (*בתום לב*) and for value. This is earlier than the Agency Law.\n    *   **Absentees' Property Law, 1950:** This is a very early law passed in the nascent years of the state. We need to check its text. Section 17(a) provides a defense for a person who acquired property from someone who was not the absentee owner, provided the transaction was done \"in good faith and for valuable consideration\" (*בתום-לב ובתמורה*).\n\n4.  **Comparing the Candidates:**\n    *   Contracts (General Part) Law: 1973\n    *   Land Law: 1969\n    *   Agency Law: 1965\n    *   Bills of Exchange Ordinance [New Version]: 1957\n    *   Absentees' Property Law: 1950\n\n    Chronologically, the **Absentees' Property Law, 1950** is the earliest of these statutes to explicitly use the term \"good faith\" (*tom lev*).\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** The key is the explicit use of the phrase. The concept of fair dealing existed in law before, but the question concerns the specific codification of the term \"good faith.\"\n*   **Specific Application vs. General Principle:** The early uses of \"good faith\" (like in the Absentees' Property Law or Bills of Exchange Ordinance) were in very specific contexts. The Contracts (General Part) Law, 1973, was revolutionary because it elevated \"good faith\" to a general, overriding principle applicable to all contracts and, by judicial extension, much of Israeli civil law. The question, however, asks for the first *introduction*, not the first *generalization*.\n*   **Mandate-era Law:** The Bills of Exchange Ordinance is a \"New Version\" of a British Mandate law. However, the 1957 version is a formal statute of the State of Israel. Even so, the 1950 law is earlier.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the chronological analysis of Israeli statutes enacted since 1948, the Absentees' Property Law of 1950 is the first to explicitly contain the legal term \"good faith\" (*tom lev*).\n\n<<<Absentees' Property Law>>>"
