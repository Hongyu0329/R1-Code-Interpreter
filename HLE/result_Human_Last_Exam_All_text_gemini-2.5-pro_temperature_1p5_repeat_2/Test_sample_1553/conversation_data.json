    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the main character of the novel.**\nThe novel \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość\" (\"Perfect Imperfection\") by Jacek Dukaj centers around Adam Zamoyski, a 21st-century man who is resurrected in the distant future. He is the main protagonist of the story.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the main character's relationships.**\nThroughout the novel, Adam Zamoyski interacts with several key female characters. It's important to distinguish between them to find the one he marries.\n*   **Olga:** She was Adam's wife in his original 21st-century life. She is also resurrected but struggles immensely to adapt to the future. Their relationship in this new reality is strained and ultimately does not continue. They do not remarry.\n*   **Angelika:** She is a \"Standard Model Citizen\" of the future who is assigned as Adam's guide and caretaker upon his re-creation. She helps him navigate the complexities of the new world.\n*   **Salomea:** A powerful and ancient post-human being (a \"phoebe\") who takes an interest in Adam for strategic reasons. Their relationship is complex but not marital.\n\n**Step 3: Pinpoint the specific plot point of the marriage.**\nAs Adam adapts to his new life, his initial guardian-ward relationship with Angelika evolves. They develop a deep emotional bond and become partners. The culmination of this relationship is their union, which is presented as a marriage within the context of the story. Adam Zamoyski formally marries Angelika.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n1.  **Distinguishing past from present:** It is crucial not to confuse Adam's original 21st-century wife, Olga, with the character he marries in the future setting of the novel.\n2.  **Context of \"marriage\":** The concept and ceremony of marriage in the far future depicted in the book are different from contemporary ones, but the bond formed between Adam and Angelika is explicitly a marriage.\n3.  **Correct character identification:** The answer is Angelika, his guide-turned-partner, not the more powerful entities like Salomea or his former wife, Olga.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the plot of \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość,\" the main character, Adam Zamoyski, marries Angelika.\n\n<<<Angelika>>>"
