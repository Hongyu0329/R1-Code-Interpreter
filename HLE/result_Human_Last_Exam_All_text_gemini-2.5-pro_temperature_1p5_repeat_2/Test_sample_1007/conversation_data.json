    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of each ballet step to determine which one has the same ending leg position as the starting position.\n\n**Analysis of the Question**\n\nThe question asks to identify which of the given classical ballet steps finishes in the exact same leg position as it started. In the context of steps that begin and end in a closed position like fifth position, \"same leg position\" means the same foot is in front at both the start and the finish.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis of Each Option**\n\n1.  **A. Entrechat six**\n    *   **Starting Position:** Typically begins in fifth position (e.g., right foot in front).\n    *   **Execution:** This is a jump with six crossings or \"beats\" of the legs in the air. A jump with an even number of beats (like deux, quatre, six) always lands with the feet switched.\n    *   **Ending Position:** Lands in fifth position, but with the opposite foot in front (e.g., left foot in front).\n    *   **Careful Point:** Even-numbered entrechats change the feet; odd-numbered ones (like entrechat trois or cinq) land on one foot. Therefore, the starting and ending positions are different.\n\n2.  **B. Échappé battu changé**\n    *   **Starting Position:** Begins in fifth position (e.g., right foot in front).\n    *   **Execution:** *Échappé* means to escape; the feet jump from a closed position (fifth) to an open one (second). *Battu* means it is beaten (legs cross and beat together before landing). *Changé* explicitly means \"changed.\" The dancer jumps, opens to second, beats the legs, and lands back in fifth position with the feet changed.\n    *   **Ending Position:** Lands in fifth position with the opposite foot in front (e.g., left foot in front).\n    *   **Careful Point:** The word *changé* in the name of the step is a direct indicator that the feet will change position.\n\n3.  **C. Assemblé**\n    *   **Starting Position:** Often starts from fifth position, with the working leg sliding out.\n    *   **Execution:** *Assemblé* means to assemble. The dancer brushes one foot out and then jumps, bringing both legs together (\"assembling\" them) in the air and landing on both feet simultaneously in fifth position. Common types, such as *assemblé dessus* (over) or *assemblé dessous* (under), result in a change of feet. For example, in an *assemblé dessus* starting with the right foot front, the left foot brushes to the side and lands in front.\n    *   **Ending Position:** The position almost always changes.\n    *   **Careful Point:** While a less common version exists that doesn't change feet, the standard forms of assemblé taught and performed involve changing the position.\n\n4.  **D. Glissade derrière**\n    *   **Starting Position:** Begins in fifth position (e.g., right foot in front).\n    *   **Execution:** *Glissade* is a gliding step. For *glissade derrière* (behind), the dancer extends the back foot first, transfers weight, and the front foot closes *behind* it. So, if starting with the right foot front, the left foot slides out, and the right foot glides to close behind the left.\n    *   **Ending Position:** The original front foot is now in the back. The step finishes in fifth position with the opposite foot in front (e.g., left foot in front).\n    *   **Careful Point:** Both *glissade devant* (to the front) and *glissade derrière* (to the back) change the feet. Only a *glissade changée* (which is rare) would potentially land as it started, but that is not the step listed.\n\n5.  **E. Gargouillade**\n    *   **Starting Position:** Begins in fifth position (e.g., right foot in front).\n    *   **Execution:** This is a complex, decorative step, similar in pathway to a *pas de chat*. The dancer performs a small, quick circle (*rond de jambe*) with the first leg as it lifts, jumps, performs another quick *rond de jambe* with the second leg in the air, and then lands on the first leg before closing the second leg back to its original position.\n    *   **Detailed Execution:** Start with the right foot front. The back (left) leg lifts with a *rond de jambe en dehors*. The dancer jumps off the right leg. While in the air, the right leg performs a quick *rond de jambe en dehors*. The dancer lands on the left foot and then closes the right foot back in front.\n    *   **Ending Position:** The step finishes in the original fifth position (right foot in front).\n    *   **Careful Point:** The key feature of a gargouillade is that it's an embellishment of a step that returns to the starting position. It's a \"there and back again\" type of movement.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nAfter analyzing all the options, Gargouillade is the only step that, by its standard definition, starts and ends with the feet in the same fifth position. All other listed steps involve a change of feet (*changé*).\n\n<<<E>>>"
