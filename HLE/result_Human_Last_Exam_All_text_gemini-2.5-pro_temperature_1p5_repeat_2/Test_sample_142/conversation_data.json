    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of Configuration State Functions (CSFs) in a full CI calculation of $\\mathrm{CH}_2 \\mathrm{SiHF}$ using a 6-31G** basis set.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Determine the total number of electrons (N)**\n\nFirst, we need to find the total number of electrons in the neutral molecule $\\mathrm{CH}_2 \\mathrm{SiHF}$ by summing the atomic numbers of its constituent atoms.\n*   Carbon (C): 6 electrons\n*   Hydrogen (H): 1 electron per atom. There are 3 H atoms, so $3 \\times 1 = 3$ electrons.\n*   Silicon (Si): 14 electrons\n*   Fluorine (F): 9 electrons\n\nTotal number of electrons, $N = 6 (\\text{C}) + 3 (\\text{H}) + 14 (\\text{Si}) + 9 (\\text{F}) = 32$ electrons.\n\nFor a singlet ground state, the electrons are paired. The number of alpha-spin electrons ($N_\\alpha$) equals the number of beta-spin electrons ($N_\\beta$).\n$N_\\alpha = N_\\beta = N/2 = 32/2 = 16$.\n\n**Careful Point:** Ensure all atoms in the chemical formula are accounted for. The molecule $\\mathrm{CH}_2 \\mathrm{SiHF}$ has 1 Carbon, 3 Hydrogen, 1 Silicon, and 1 Fluorine atom.\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Determine the number of basis functions / spatial orbitals (K)**\n\nNext, we calculate the total number of basis functions for the 6-31G** basis set. The `**` notation (or `(d,p)`) means that d-type polarization functions are added to heavy (non-hydrogen) atoms and p-type polarization functions are added to hydrogen atoms. We assume the standard 6 Cartesian d-functions and 3 Cartesian p-functions.\n\n*   **For each Hydrogen (H):**\n    *   The 6-31G part gives 2 basis functions (1s orbital is split into two).\n    *   The second `*` (p) adds 3 p-type functions ($p_x, p_y, p_z$).\n    *   Total per H atom: $2 + 3 = 5$ basis functions.\n    *   Total for 3 H atoms: $3 \\times 5 = 15$ basis functions.\n\n*   **For Carbon (C), a 2nd-row heavy atom:**\n    *   The 6-31G part gives 9 basis functions (1s core, 2s/2p valence split into inner and outer shells).\n    *   The first `*` (d) adds 6 d-type functions.\n    *   Total for C atom: $9 + 6 = 15$ basis functions.\n\n*   **For Fluorine (F), a 2nd-row heavy atom:**\n    *   Same as Carbon.\n    *   Total for F atom: $9 + 6 = 15$ basis functions.\n\n*   **For Silicon (Si), a 3rd-row heavy atom:**\n    *   The 6-31G part gives 13 basis functions (1s/2s/2p core, 3s/3p valence split into inner and outer shells).\n    *   The first `*` (d) adds 6 d-type functions.\n    *   Total for Si atom: $13 + 6 = 19$ basis functions.\n\nThe total number of basis functions (which equals the number of spatial orbitals, K, in a molecular orbital calculation) is the sum for all atoms:\n$K = 15 (\\text{for C}) + 15 (\\text{for 3H}) + 19 (\\text{for Si}) + 15 (\\text{for F}) = 64$ spatial orbitals.\n\n**Careful Point:** Correctly interpreting the basis set notation and knowing the number of functions it generates for different types of atoms (H, 2nd row, 3rd row) is crucial. A common mistake is miscounting these functions.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: State the formula for the number of singlet CSFs**\n\nA full CI calculation considers all possible electronic configurations. The number of singlet ($S=0$) Configuration State Functions (CSFs) can be calculated using the following formula, which is derived from group theory (specifically, the representation theory of the unitary group):\n\n$N_{CSF}(S=0) = D(M_S=0) - D(M_S=1)$\n\nWhere $D(M_S)$ is the number of Slater determinants with a given projection of the total spin, $M_S$. This is calculated as:\n$D(M_S) = \\binom{K}{N_\\alpha} \\binom{K}{N_\\beta}$\nwith $N_\\alpha + N_\\beta = N$ and $N_\\alpha - N_\\beta = 2 M_S$.\n\n*   For $M_S = 0$: $N_\\alpha = N_\\beta = N/2 = 16$.\n    $D(M_S=0) = \\binom{K}{16} \\binom{K}{16} = \\binom{64}{16}^2$.\n*   For $M_S = 1$: $N_\\alpha - N_\\beta = 2$. With $N_\\alpha + N_\\beta = 32$, this gives $N_\\alpha=17$ and $N_\\beta=15$.\n    $D(M_S=1) = \\binom{K}{17} \\binom{K}{15} = \\binom{64}{17} \\binom{64}{15}$.\n\nSo, the formula for our specific case is:\n$N_{CSF}(S=0) = \\binom{64}{16}^2 - \\binom{64}{17} \\binom{64}{15}$\n\n**Careful Point:** It is important to use the formula for the number of CSFs, not the much larger number of Slater determinants ($D(M_S=0)$). The CSF count represents the dimension of the spin-adapted CI problem.\n\n---\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the final number**\n\nWe need to compute the value from the formula. We can simplify the expression algebraically first:\nNote that $\\binom{n}{k+1} = \\binom{n}{k} \\frac{n-k}{k+1}$ and $\\binom{n}{k-1} = \\binom{n}{k} \\frac{k}{n-k+1}$.\n$\\binom{64}{17} = \\binom{64}{16} \\frac{64-16}{16+1} = \\binom{64}{16} \\frac{48}{17}$\n$\\binom{64}{15} = \\binom{64}{16} \\frac{16}{64-16+1} = \\binom{64}{16} \\frac{16}{49}$\n\nSubstitute these into the main formula:\n$N_{CSF} = \\binom{64}{16}^2 - \\left(\\binom{64}{16} \\frac{48}{17}\\right) \\left(\\binom{64}{16} \\frac{16}{49}\\right)$\n$N_{CSF} = \\binom{64}{16}^2 \\left(1 - \\frac{48 \\times 16}{17 \\times 49}\\right)$\n$N_{CSF} = \\binom{64}{16}^2 \\left(1 - \\frac{768}{833}\\right)$\n$N_{CSF} = \\binom{64}{16}^2 \\left(\\frac{833 - 768}{833}\\right)$\n$N_{CSF} = \\binom{64}{16}^2 \\left(\\frac{65}{833}\\right)$\n\nNow, we calculate the value of the binomial coefficient:\n$\\binom{64}{16} = 365,178,401,344,401$\n\nFinally, we compute the number of CSFs:\n$N_{CSF} = (365,178,401,344,401)^2 \\times \\frac{65}{833}$\n$N_{CSF} = (133,355,298,086,001,086,815,200,880,1) \\times \\frac{65}{833}$\n$N_{CSF} = 10,405,875,600,948,464,157,248,568,075$\n\n**Careful Point:** This calculation involves extremely large numbers. Algebraic simplification before computation is helpful, and a computational tool is necessary for the final arithmetic.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n<<<10405875600948464157248568075>>>"
