    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the unique $\\tau$-tilting module that is not a slice for the path algebra $A = \\mathbb{C}(1 \\to 2 \\to 3)$.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Algebra and its Modules\n\nThe algebra $A$ is the path algebra of the quiver $Q: 1 \\xrightarrow{\\alpha} 2 \\xrightarrow{\\beta} 3$. This is a hereditary algebra of Dynkin type $A_3$. The number of simple modules is $|A|=3$.\n\nLet's list the indecomposable $A$-modules. They can be denoted by $M_{i,j}$ for $1 \\le i \\le j \\le 3$, representing the module with support on vertices $\\{i, i+1, \\dots, j\\}$ and identity maps between them. There are $\\frac{3(3+1)}{2}=6$ such modules.\n\n*   **Simple Modules:**\n    *   $S_1 = M_{1,1}$ with dimension vector $(1,0,0)$.\n    *   $S_2 = M_{2,2}$ with dimension vector $(0,1,0)$.\n    *   $S_3 = M_{3,3}$ with dimension vector $(0,0,1)$.\n*   **Indecomposable Projective Modules:**\n    *   $P_1 = M_{1,3}$ with dimension vector $(1,1,1)$.\n    *   $P_2 = M_{2,3}$ with dimension vector $(0,1,1)$.\n    *   $P_3 = M_{3,3} = S_3$.\n*   **Indecomposable Injective Modules:**\n    *   $I_1 = M_{1,1} = S_1$.\n    *   $I_2 = M_{1,2}$ with dimension vector $(1,1,0)$.\n    *   $I_3 = M_{1,3} = P_1$.\n\nThe six non-isomorphic indecomposable $A$-modules are:\n$S_1 (=I_1)$, $S_2$, $S_3 (=P_3)$, $P_2$, $I_2$, $P_1 (=I_3)$.\n\n### Step 2: Understand $\\tau$-tilting Modules and Slices\n\n*   **$\\tau$-tilting Theory:** In the modern theory by Adachi, Iyama, and Reiten (AIR), a module $T$ is called a **$\\tau$-tilting module** if it corresponds to a **support $\\tau$-tilting pair** $(M, P)$. A pair $(M, P)$ is a support $\\tau$-tilting pair if:\n    1.  $P$ is a projective module.\n    2.  $M$ is a module with no projective summands.\n    3.  The number of non-isomorphic indecomposable summands of $M \\oplus P$ is $|A|=3$.\n    4.  $M$ is **$\\tau$-rigid**, meaning $\\text{Hom}_A(M, \\tau M) = 0$. For a hereditary algebra like $A$, this is equivalent to $\\text{Ext}^1_A(M, M) = 0$.\n    5.  $\\text{Hom}_A(P, M) = 0$.\n    The module $T$ is the direct sum of the indecomposable summands of $M \\oplus P$.\n\n*   **Slice Modules:** A **slice** is a special set of indecomposable modules in the Auslander-Reiten (AR) quiver of a hereditary algebra. A module $T$ is a **slice module** if it is the direct sum of the modules in a slice. A key property of slice modules for hereditary algebras is that they are **sincere**.\n*   **Sincere Modules:** A module $T$ is sincere if every simple module $S_i$ appears as a composition factor of $T$. This is equivalent to the dimension vector of $T$ having all non-zero entries.\n\n*   **Connecting Concepts:** For a hereditary algebra, a module $T$ is a slice module if and only if it is a **sincere classical tilting module**. The modern framework of $\\tau$-tilting theory is a generalization. A $\\tau$-tilting module is a classical tilting module if and only if it is sincere.\n\nTherefore, the question \"which unique $\\tau$-tilting module is not a slice?\" is equivalent to finding the \"unique non-sincere $\\tau$-tilting module\".\n\n### Step 3: Find Non-Sincere Modules\n\nA non-sincere module must have a zero in at least one component of its dimension vector. Let $T = T_1 \\oplus T_2 \\oplus T_3$ be a module with three non-isomorphic indecomposable summands.\n\nLet's look for combinations of three indecomposable modules whose summed dimension vector is not sincere.\nThe dimension vectors are:\n$S_1:(1,0,0)$, $S_2:(0,1,0)$, $S_3:(0,0,1)$, $P_2:(0,1,1)$, $I_2:(1,1,0)$, $P_1:(1,1,1)$.\n\n*   **Case 1: Support on vertices $\\{2, 3\\}$ (1st component of dim vector is 0).**\n    The indecomposable modules with support only on vertices $\\{2, 3\\}$ are $S_2, S_3, P_2$. We must choose all three.\n    Let $T_A = S_2 \\oplus S_3 \\oplus P_2$.\n    The dimension vector of $T_A$ is $(0,1,0) + (0,0,1) + (0,1,1) = (0,2,2)$, which is not sincere.\n\n*   **Case 2: Support on vertices $\\{1, 2\\}$ (3rd component of dim vector is 0).**\n    The indecomposable modules with support only on vertices $\\{1, 2\\}$ are $S_1, S_2, I_2$. We must choose all three.\n    Let $T_B = S_1 \\oplus S_2 \\oplus I_2$.\n    The dimension vector of $T_B$ is $(1,0,0) + (0,1,0) + (1,1,0) = (2,2,0)$, which is not sincere.\n\n*   **Case 3: Support on vertices $\\{1, 3\\}$ (2nd component of dim vector is 0).**\n    The indecomposable modules with support only on vertices $\\{1, 3\\}$ are $S_1, S_3, P_1$. We could pick these three. But $P_1$ has support on vertex 2. So no such module with 3 summands exists. The only modules with 0 in the second component of their dimension vector are $S_1$ and $S_3$. We cannot form a module with 3 summands.\n\nSo we have two potential candidates for a non-sincere $\\tau$-tilting module: $T_A$ and $T_B$.\n\n### Step 4: Check if Candidates are $\\tau$-tilting Modules\n\nWe now check if $T_A$ and $T_B$ correspond to valid support $\\tau$-tilting pairs.\n\n*   **Analysis of $T_A = S_2 \\oplus S_3 \\oplus P_2$:**\n    We form the pair $(M,P)$. The projective part is $P=S_3 \\oplus P_2$ (since $S_3=P_3$). The non-projective part is $M=S_2$.\n    Let's check the conditions for the pair $(S_2, P_2 \\oplus P_3)$:\n    1.  $|M|+|P| = 1+2=3$. OK.\n    2.  $M=S_2$ has no projective summands. OK.\n    3.  $M=S_2$ is $\\tau$-rigid. $\\text{Ext}^1(S_2, S_2) = 0$. OK.\n    4.  $\\text{Hom}_A(P, M) = \\text{Hom}_A(P_2 \\oplus P_3, S_2) = 0$?\n        We have $\\text{Hom}(P_3, S_2)=0$, but $\\text{Hom}(P_2, S_2) \\ne 0$ because $S_2$ is the top of $P_2$.\n        So the condition $\\text{Hom}_A(P, M) = 0$ fails.\n    Thus, $T_A$ is **not** a $\\tau$-tilting module.\n\n*   **Analysis of $T_B = S_1 \\oplus S_2 \\oplus I_2$:**\n    We form the pair $(M,P)$. None of the summands $S_1, S_2, I_2$ are projective.\n    So the projective part is $P=0$. The non-projective part is $M = S_1 \\oplus S_2 \\oplus I_2$.\n    Let's check the conditions for the pair $(S_1 \\oplus S_2 \\oplus I_2, 0)$:\n    1.  $|M|+|P| = 3+0=3$. OK.\n    2.  $M$ has no projective summands. OK.\n    3.  $\\text{Hom}_A(P, M) = \\text{Hom}_A(0, M) = 0$. OK.\n    4.  $M = S_1 \\oplus S_2 \\oplus I_2$ must be $\\tau$-rigid, i.e., $\\text{Ext}^1_A(M,M)=0$.\n        Since $S_1 = I_1$ and $I_2$ are injective modules, $\\text{Ext}^1(X, S_1) = 0$ and $\\text{Ext}^1(X, I_2) = 0$ for any module $X$.\n        So we only need to check the Ext groups with $S_2$ as the second argument:\n        $\\text{Ext}^1(S_1, S_2)$, $\\text{Ext}^1(S_2, S_2)$, $\\text{Ext}^1(I_2, S_2)$.\n        All of these can be shown to be zero by direct computation or using the AR-quiver properties. For instance, $\\text{Ext}^1(I_2, S_2) \\cong D\\text{Hom}(S_2, \\tau I_2) = 0$ as $I_2$ is injective, so $\\tau I_2 = 0$.\n    Thus, $M$ is $\\tau$-rigid. All conditions are satisfied.\n    $T_B$ **is** a $\\tau$-tilting module.\n\n### Step 5: Final Conclusion\n\nWe have found that there is exactly one non-sincere $\\tau$-tilting module, which is $T_B = S_1 \\oplus S_2 \\oplus I_2$. Since it is not sincere, it cannot be a slice module. It is the unique such module among all $\\tau$-tilting modules for $A$.\n\nThe final answer is the module $S_1 \\oplus S_2 \\oplus I_2$.\n\n<<<S_1 \\oplus S_2 \\oplus I_2>>>"
