    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the poetic device in the line.\n\n**1. Analyze the Question and Constraints**\n\n*   **The Line:** \"Nascere, praeque diem veniens age, Lucifer, almum\" (Vergil, *Eclogues* 8.17).\n*   **The Goal:** Identify a Latin poetic device present in this line.\n*   **The Exclusions:** The device cannot be:\n    *   Apostrophe / Personification\n    *   Any sound effect (alliteration, assonance, consonance)\n    *   Hyperbaton\n\n**2. Translate and Analyze the Grammar of the Line**\n\n*   `Nascere`: \"Be born\" or \"Arise.\" This is a 2nd person singular present imperative of the deponent verb `nascor`.\n*   `praeque`: This is the adverb `prae` (\"before,\" \"in front\") combined with the enclitic conjunction `-que` (\"and\").\n*   `diem`: \"The day.\" Accusative singular noun, object of the verb `age`.\n*   `veniens`: \"Coming.\" Present active participle, nominative singular, modifying the subject of the sentence (the \"you\" addressed, which is Lucifer).\n*   `age`: \"Bring on\" or \"drive.\" This is a 2nd person singular present imperative of the verb `ago`.\n*   `Lucifer`: \"O Lucifer\" (the Morning Star). Vocative case, the one being addressed.\n*   `almum`: \"Nurturing,\" \"kindly.\" Accusative singular adjective, modifying `diem`.\n\n**Full Translation:** \"Be born, and coming beforehand, bring on the kindly day, O Lucifer.\"\n\n**3. Verify the Excluded Devices**\n\n*   **Apostrophe/Personification:** The poet directly addresses the Morning Star (`Lucifer`) as if it were a person who could understand and obey commands. This is clearly present.\n*   **Hyperbaton:** The noun `diem` is separated from its modifying adjective `almum` by several words (`veniens age, Lucifer`). This is a clear case of hyperbaton.\n*   **Sound Effects:** Assonance is present in the repetition of the 'e' sound: `praequ**e** di**e**m v**e**ni**e**ns ag**e**`.\n\nSince all the excluded devices are present, we must look for something else.\n\n**4. Step-by-Step Analysis to Find Another Device**\n\nLet's examine the core command given to Lucifer. It is expressed through two main verbs in the imperative mood: `Nascere` (Be born) and `age` (Bring on). These two verbs are connected by the conjunction `-que` (\"and\").\n\n*   **Action 1:** `Nascere` (Be born/Arise)\n*   **Action 2:** `age [diem]` (Bring on [the day])\n\nLogically, for the Morning Star, \"arising\" and \"bringing on the day\" are not two separate, sequential actions. Rather, its arising *is* the act of bringing on the day. The two actions describe a single, complex event.\n\nThe poetic device where two words (often verbs or nouns) are joined by a conjunction (\"and\") to express a single, complex idea is called **Hendiadys**. The term literally means \"one through two.\" Instead of saying \"Bring on the day by arising,\" Vergil says \"Arise **and** bring on the day.\" He uses two coordinate verbs to express an idea that would more typically be structured with one verb modifying the other (e.g., using a participle or a subordinate clause).\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n\nThe two main verbs, `Nascere` and `age`, are used in a coordinate structure to describe the single action of the Morning Star heralding the dawn. This use of two words joined by \"and\" to convey a single idea is the definition of Hendiadys.\n\n<<<Hendiadys>>>"
