    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the number sequence problem.\n\n**Step 1: Write down the given sequence.**\nThe sequence is: 2, 11, 23, 51, 119, ( )\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the relationship between consecutive terms.**\nA common method for number sequences is to look for a pattern in the differences or ratios between terms.\n\n*   **Difference Method:**\n    *   11 - 2 = 9\n    *   23 - 11 = 12\n    *   51 - 23 = 28\n    *   119 - 51 = 68\n    The sequence of differences is 9, 12, 28, 68. There is no immediately obvious simple pattern (like arithmetic or geometric) in these differences.\n\n*   **Ratio Method:**\n    *   11 / 2 = 5.5\n    *   23 / 11 ≈ 2.09\n    *   51 / 23 ≈ 2.21\n    *   119 / 51 ≈ 2.33\n    The ratios are not constant. However, they are all slightly above 2. This suggests a pattern of the form `Next Term = 2 * Current Term + something`.\n\n**Step 3: Test the hypothesis `Next Term = 2 * Current Term + Remainder`.**\nLet's call the sequence `a_n`. We are testing the formula `a_{n+1} = 2 * a_n + b_n`, where `b_n` is a \"remainder\" sequence we need to figure out.\n\n*   For the second term (11): `2 * a_1 + b_1 = 2 * 2 + b_1 = 4 + b_1 = 11`. This means `b_1 = 7`.\n*   For the third term (23): `2 * a_2 + b_2 = 2 * 11 + b_2 = 22 + b_2 = 23`. This means `b_2 = 1`.\n*   For the fourth term (51): `2 * a_3 + b_3 = 2 * 23 + b_3 = 46 + b_3 = 51`. This means `b_3 = 5`.\n*   For the fifth term (119): `2 * a_4 + b_4 = 2 * 51 + b_4 = 102 + b_4 = 119`. This means `b_4 = 17`.\n\nSo, the original problem is transformed into finding the next term in the remainder sequence `b_n`: 7, 1, 5, 17, (?).\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the remainder sequence `b_n`.**\nThe sequence is `b_n`: 7, 1, 5, 17, ...\nOften in such problems, the first term can be an anomaly or an initialization value. Let's analyze the pattern starting from the second term: 1, 5, 17.\n\n*   Let's find the differences in this sub-sequence:\n    *   5 - 1 = 4\n    *   17 - 5 = 12\n\n*   Now let's analyze the sequence of these new differences: 4, 12, ...\n    *   We can see a clear pattern here: `12 = 4 * 3`. This is a geometric progression with a common ratio of 3.\n\n**Step 5: Predict the next terms based on the discovered pattern.**\n\n*   The next term in the difference sequence (4, 12, ...) will be `12 * 3 = 36`.\n*   This means the next term in the remainder sub-sequence (1, 5, 17, ...) will be the previous term (17) plus this new difference (36). So, `17 + 36 = 53`.\n*   This value, 53, is the next term in our remainder sequence `b_n`. So, `b_5 = 53`.\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the final answer.**\nWe can now find the missing term in the original sequence using the formula from Step 3: `a_6 = 2 * a_5 + b_5`.\n\n*   `a_5` is the last known term, which is 119.\n*   `b_5` is the value we just calculated, which is 53.\n*   `a_6 = 2 * 119 + 53`\n*   `a_6 = 238 + 53`\n*   `a_6 = 291`\n\nThe number that should be filled in the parentheses is 291. This matches option A.\n\n**Final List of Careful Points:**\n1.  Simple difference/ratio analysis may not be sufficient. A mixed pattern (`y = 2x + c`) is a common alternative.\n2.  When a derived sequence is found (like our remainder sequence `b_n`), the pattern might not apply to the very first term. It's important to be flexible and check for patterns starting from the second term.\n3.  The pattern within the derived sequence can be of a different type (in this case, its differences formed a geometric progression).\n4.  Double-check all arithmetic calculations at each step to ensure accuracy.\n\n<<<A>>>"
