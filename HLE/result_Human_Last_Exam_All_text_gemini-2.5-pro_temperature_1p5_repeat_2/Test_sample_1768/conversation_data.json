    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the reading frame and translate the nucleotide sequence.\n\n**Analysis of the Question and Careful Points**\n\n1.  **The Goal:** The main objective is to translate a given DNA sequence into a protein sequence.\n2.  **Key Information:** The sequence is from the **middle of an Open Reading Frame (ORF)**. This is a crucial clue. An ORF is a continuous stretch of codons that codes for a protein. A sequence from the *middle* of an ORF should not contain any in-frame stop codons (TAA, TAG, TGA).\n3.  **The Task:** We must test the three possible forward reading frames. The correct frame will be the one that is \"open,\" i.e., free of stop codons. Once the correct frame is identified, we must translate it into a protein sequence using the one-letter amino acid code.\n4.  **Input Sequence:** `ggacattgttgttagcgaagacttgaatggaacggtgaagttttcaagctctttaccctaccccaataatcttaacagtgtcctggctgagcgactggagaagtggc`\n5.  **Stop Codons:** We need to be vigilant for the three stop codons: `TAA`, `TAG`, and `TGA`.\n\n---\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis and Translation**\n\nThe DNA sequence has 99 nucleotides. We will test each of the three reading frames.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reading Frame 1**\nThis frame starts from the first nucleotide. We will group the sequence into codons (groups of three).\n\n*   **Codons:** `gga cat tgt tgt tag cga aga ctt gaa tgg aac ggt gaa gtt ttc aag ctc ttt acc cta ccc caa taa tct taa cag tgt cct ggc tga ...`\n*   **Analysis:** We can immediately spot several stop codons in this frame:\n    *   `tag` (Stop)\n    *   `taa` (Stop)\n    *   `taa` (Stop)\n    *   `tga` (Stop)\n*   **Conclusion:** The presence of multiple stop codons means this cannot be the correct reading frame for a sequence from the middle of an ORF.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reading Frame 2**\nThis frame starts from the second nucleotide. We will ignore the first nucleotide and group the rest into codons.\n\n*   **Sequence (starting from base 2):** `gacattgttgttagcgaagacttgaatggaacggtgaagttttcaagctctttaccctaccccaataatcttaacagtgtcctggctgagcgactggagaagtgg`\n*   **Codons:** `gac att gtt gtt agc gaa gac ttg aat gga acg gtg aag ttt tca agc tct tta ccc tac ccc aat aat ctt aac agt gtc ctg gct gag cga ctg gag aag tgg`\n*   **Analysis:** A scan of these codons shows no stop codons (`TAA`, `TAG`, `TGA`). This is a strong candidate for the correct ORF.\n*   **Translation:** We translate each codon into its corresponding one-letter amino acid:\n    *   `gac` -> D (Aspartic acid)\n    *   `att` -> I (Isoleucine)\n    *   `gtt` -> V (Valine)\n    *   `gtt` -> V (Valine)\n    *   `agc` -> S (Serine)\n    *   `gaa` -> E (Glutamic acid)\n    *   `gac` -> D (Aspartic acid)\n    *   `ttg` -> L (Leucine)\n    *   `aat` -> N (Asparagine)\n    *   `gga` -> G (Glycine)\n    *   `acg` -> T (Threonine)\n    *   `gtg` -> V (Valine)\n    *   `aag` -> K (Lysine)\n    *   `ttt` -> F (Phenylalanine)\n    *   `tca` -> S (Serine)\n    *   `agc` -> S (Serine)\n    *   `tct` -> S (Serine)\n    *   `tta` -> L (Leucine)\n    *   `ccc` -> P (Proline)\n    *   `tac` -> Y (Tyrosine)\n    *   `ccc` -> P (Proline)\n    *   `aat` -> N (Asparagine)\n    *   `aat` -> N (Asparagine)\n    *   `ctt` -> L (Leucine)\n    *   `aac` -> N (Asparagine)\n    *   `agt` -> S (Serine)\n    *   `gtc` -> V (Valine)\n    *   `ctg` -> L (Leucine)\n    *   `gct` -> A (Alanine)\n    *   `gag` -> E (Glutamic acid)\n    *   `cga` -> R (Arginine)\n    *   `ctg` -> L (Leucine)\n    *   `gag` -> E (Glutamic acid)\n    *   `aag` -> K (Lysine)\n    *   `tgg` -> W (Tryptophan)\n*   **Conclusion:** Frame 2 is an open frame, making it the correct reading frame.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Reading Frame 3**\nThis frame starts from the third nucleotide. We ignore the first two nucleotides.\n\n*   **Sequence (starting from base 3):** `acattgttgttagcgaagacttgaatggaacggtgaagttttcaagctctttaccctaccccaataatcttaacagtgtcctggctgagcgactggagaagtggc`\n*   **Codons:** `aca ttg ttg tta gcg aag act tga atg gaa cgg tga agt ttt caa gct ctt tac cct acc cca ata atc tta aca gtg tcc tgg ...`\n*   **Analysis:** We can spot stop codons in this frame:\n    *   `tga` (Stop)\n    *   `tga` (Stop)\n*   **Conclusion:** The presence of stop codons means this is not the correct reading frame.\n\n**Final Answer Derivation**\n\nBased on the analysis, only Reading Frame 2 is \"open\" (contains no stop codons). Therefore, the correct reading frame is **Frame 2**, and its translated protein sequence is the final answer.\n\n**Protein Sequence from Frame 2:**\nDIVVSEDLNGTVKFSSSLPYPPNNLNSVLAERLEKW\n\n<<<DIVVSEDLNGTVKFSSSLPYPPNNLNSVLAERLEKW>>>"
