    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the statement.\n\n**Step 1: Define the terms**\n\n*   **SNP Heritability (h²_SNP):** This term represents the proportion of the variation in a phenotype (e.g., height, risk for a disease) that can be attributed to the additive effects of all the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) considered, typically those on a standard genotyping chip. It is a theoretical concept representing the *maximum possible* predictive power you could achieve if you knew the true, precise effect of every single SNP and used them perfectly to predict the phenotype. It's the ceiling for genetic prediction based on these SNPs.\n\n*   **Polygenic Score (PGS):** A PGS (also known as a Polygenic Risk Score or PRS) is a practical tool used to estimate an individual's genetic liability for a phenotype. It is calculated by summing up the effects of many SNPs. Crucially, the \"effect\" of each SNP used in a PGS is not its true, unknown effect, but an *estimate* derived from a Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS).\n\n*   **Predictive Ability of a PGS:** This is a measure of how well the PGS actually works when applied to a new group of people (a validation or test sample). It is typically quantified by the R-squared (R²) statistic, which measures the proportion of variance in the phenotype that is explained by the PGS.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the relationship between the concepts**\n\nThe core of the question lies in the difference between a theoretical maximum (SNP heritability) and a practical implementation (the PGS).\n\n1.  **SNP Heritability is the Ceiling:** h²_SNP sets the upper limit on how much of a trait's variance can be predicted using only SNP data. You cannot explain more variance than is explainable in the first place. Therefore, the R² of a PGS can, at its absolute best, be equal to the h²_SNP, but it can never be greater. This gives us the relationship: R²_PGS ≤ h²_SNP.\n\n2.  **PGS is an Imperfect Estimate:** A PGS is built using effect sizes estimated from a GWAS of a *finite* number of people. Because the sample size is finite, these effect estimates are not perfect; they have statistical \"noise\" or error. This estimation error means the PGS will not be a perfect predictor.\n\n3.  **Sources of Imperfection:** Several factors guarantee that a real-world PGS will underperform relative to the theoretical maximum (h²_SNP):\n    *   **Finite GWAS Sample Size:** This is the primary reason. Smaller GWASs lead to less precise SNP effect estimates, which in turn leads to a less accurate PGS. Only a GWAS of infinite size would yield perfect estimates.\n    *   **Linkage Disequilibrium (LD):** The genetic correlation structure (LD) might differ between the GWAS sample and the sample where the PGS is being tested, reducing its accuracy.\n    *   **Winner's Curse:** SNPs selected for inclusion in the PGS often have their effects overestimated in the initial GWAS, which reduces predictive accuracy in a new sample.\n    *   **Genetic Architecture:** The prediction is more difficult for traits influenced by many rare variants, as their effects are very hard to estimate accurately.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the phrase \"necessarily lower\"**\n\nThe statement uses the strong term \"necessarily lower\". This implies that R²_PGS < h²_SNP must always be true.\n\n*   In any practical, real-world scenario, the imperfections mentioned in Step 2 are always present. We never have an infinitely large GWAS. Therefore, the effect sizes used to build a PGS are never perfect. Consequently, the predictive ability of any real PGS will be strictly lower than the SNP heritability.\n*   The only theoretical case where equality could be achieved (R²_PGS = h²_SNP) is in the limit of an infinitely large GWAS, where the estimated effects would converge to the true effects. Since this is a theoretical limit and not an achievable reality, for all practical purposes, the predictive ability is indeed lower.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nSNP heritability is the theoretical upper bound of prediction using SNPs. A polygenic score is a practical application that attempts to reach that bound. Due to real-world limitations, most importantly the estimation error from finite sample sizes in GWAS, the performance of a PGS will always fall short of this theoretical maximum. Thus, its predictive ability is necessarily lower than the SNP heritability.\n\n<<<True>>>"
