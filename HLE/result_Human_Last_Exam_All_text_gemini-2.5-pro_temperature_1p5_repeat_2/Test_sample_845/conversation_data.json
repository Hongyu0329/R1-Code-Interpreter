    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The core of the question is to identify the name of the specific value measured between individual heartbeats that is used to compute Heart Rate Variability (HRV). The context given is that this measurement is performed using PPG (Photoplethysmography).\n\n2.  **Understand Heart Rate (HR) and Heart Rate Variability (HRV):**\n    *   **HR (Heart Rate):** This is the average number of heartbeats per minute (BPM). It's a single value representing the overall speed of the heart over a period.\n    *   **HRV (Heart Rate Variability):** This is not a single value but a measure of the *variation* in time between successive heartbeats. A high HRV generally indicates a healthy, adaptable autonomic nervous system, while a low HRV can be a sign of stress or health issues.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Measurement Process:**\n    *   The question states that \"beat-to-beat intervals\" are captured. This is the fundamental piece of data.\n    *   A \"beat-to-beat interval\" is the precise amount of time, usually measured in milliseconds (ms), that elapses between one heartbeat and the very next one.\n    *   HRV metrics (like RMSSD, SDNN, etc.) are all calculated from a series of these successive interval measurements.\n\n4.  **Identify the Name of the \"Value Between Heartbeats\":** This time interval has several technical names, and the correct one can depend on the measurement technology and context.\n    *   **Inter-beat Interval (IBI):** This is a general and widely used term that refers to the time between consecutive heartbeats, regardless of the technology used (ECG, PPG, etc.). It is very common in the context of wearable technology.\n    *   **RR Interval:** This is the most common term in clinical cardiology and research. It specifically refers to the time between the 'R' peaks of two consecutive QRS complexes on an ECG (Electrocardiogram). Even though the question specifies PPG, the term \"RR interval\" is so standard in the field of HRV that it's often used interchangeably with IBI, even when the data source isn't an ECG.\n    *   **NN Interval (Normal-to-Normal Interval):** This is a filtered version of the RR interval or IBI. For accurate HRV analysis, raw interval data is often processed to remove artifacts or abnormal beats (like premature ventricular contractions). The resulting intervals between two *normal* consecutive sinus beats are called NN intervals. The question asks for the fundamental value, not the filtered one, so this is less likely to be the intended answer.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Technology Specificity (PPG vs. ECG):** The question explicitly mentions PPG. The peaks in a PPG waveform correspond to the pulse wave, not the electrical 'R' wave of an ECG. Therefore, the most technically precise term for the interval from a PPG signal is \"Peak-to-Peak interval\" or \"PP interval\". However, this term is far less common in general use than IBI or RR interval.\n*   **Common Usage vs. Technical Precision:** While \"RR interval\" is technically from ECG, its use is widespread across the entire field of HRV. \"Inter-beat Interval (IBI)\" is more general and accurately describes the measurement from any source, including PPG, making it a very strong and correct answer.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe \"value between heartbeats\" used to compute HRV is the time duration of the beat-to-beat interval. The most common and accurate names for this value are the **Inter-beat Interval (IBI)** or the **RR interval**. Given that the source is PPG, \"Inter-beat Interval (IBI)\" is arguably the more precise term, but \"RR interval\" is also widely accepted due to its historical dominance in the field.\n\n<<<The Inter-beat Interval (IBI) or RR interval>>>"
