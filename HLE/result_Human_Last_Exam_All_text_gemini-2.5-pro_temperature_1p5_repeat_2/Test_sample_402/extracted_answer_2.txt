Create a reference list of genes known to be highly and specifically expressed in the co-cultured cancer cell line but not in T cells (e.g., by analyzing RNA-seq of the cancer line alone). Save this as a text file with one gene per line (e.g., `cancer_gene_list.txt`). After running your differential expression analysis to generate a results table (`differential_expression_results.tsv`), use a command-line tool to filter out the contaminating genes from the results. The recommended command is: `grep -v -w -f cancer_gene_list.txt differential_expression_results.tsv > filtered_results.tsv`. This command creates a new file (`filtered_results.tsv`) containing only the results for genes that are not on your cancer-specific contamination list.
