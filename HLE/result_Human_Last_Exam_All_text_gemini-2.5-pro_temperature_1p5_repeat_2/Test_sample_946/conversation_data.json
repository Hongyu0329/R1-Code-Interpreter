    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Subject:** The question asks about a specific detail from episode #15 of the \"Teen Girl Squad\" sub-series within the \"Homestar Runner\" online cartoons.\n2.  **Pinpoint the Event:** The specific event is the Junior Prom that the Teen Girl Squad attends.\n3.  **Identify the Object in Question:** The question focuses on a cardboard cutout of a fictional singer who is \"performing\" at this prom.\n4.  **Recall or Research the Episode's Dialogue:**\n    *   Early in the episode, Cheerleader asks, \"So, who's playin' at the prom?\"\n    *   So and So excitedly replies, \"Only the hottest indie rock band out of Cool T-shirt, Georgia!\"\n    *   What's Her Face then asks, \"You mean... Thompkins?\"\n    *   So and So clarifies with disappointment, \"No! Not Thompkins! It's... a cardboard cutout of Thompkins!\"\n5.  **Analyze the Visual Evidence at the Prom:**\n    *   Later in the episode, the scene shifts to the Junior Prom.\n    *   On the stage, there is a cardboard cutout of a male figure with a guitar.\n    *   Behind the cutout is a drum set, and the bass drum clearly has the name \"THOMPKINS\" written on it.\n6.  **Synthesize the Evidence:** Both the dialogue preceding the prom and the visual evidence at the prom itself explicitly identify the fictional singer as \"Thompkins\". The gag is that the highly anticipated performer is just a silent cardboard cutout.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Fictional Singer:** The question correctly specifies a *fictional* singer. Thompkins is a character created for the Homestar Runner universe.\n*   **Cardboard Cutout:** It is crucial to remember it's not the actual singer, but a cutout, which is a key part of the joke in the episode and mentioned in the user's question.\n*   **Episode Specificity:** The information must come from \"Teen Girl Squad #15\". The events described are unique to this episode.\n*   **Spelling:** The name is spelled \"Thompkins,\" as seen on the drum kit in the cartoon.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nBased on direct dialogue and visual text within the episode, the fictional singer represented by the cardboard cutout is named Thompkins.\n\n<<<Thompkins>>>"
