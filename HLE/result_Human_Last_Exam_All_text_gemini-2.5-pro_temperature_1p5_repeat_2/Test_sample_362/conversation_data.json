    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the Wittig reaction in question.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants and the Reaction Type:**\n    *   The first reactant is **pivalaldehyde**. Its chemical formula is (CH₃)₃C-CHO. It is an aldehyde with a sterically bulky tert-butyl group adjacent to the carbonyl group.\n    *   The second reactant is **(2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ⁵-phosphane**. This is a phosphorus ylide, which is the key reagent in a Wittig reaction. Its structure can be deduced from the name: a triphenylphosphine group (PPh₃) is double-bonded to an ethylidene group (=CH-CH₂-), which has a 2-chlorophenyl substituent on the second carbon. The structure is Ph₃P=CH-CH₂(C₆H₄Cl).\n    *   The reaction between an aldehyde and a phosphorus ylide is a **Wittig reaction**.\n\n2.  **Determine the Fundamental Transformation:**\n    *   The Wittig reaction is a powerful method for alkene synthesis. The core transformation involves replacing the C=O double bond of a carbonyl compound with a C=C double bond from the ylide.\n    *   The oxygen atom from the aldehyde's carbonyl group combines with the triphenylphosphine part of the ylide to form a stable byproduct, **triphenylphosphine oxide (Ph₃P=O)**.\n    *   The carbon backbone of the aldehyde ((CH₃)₃C-CH=) joins with the carbon backbone of the ylide (=CH-CH₂(C₆H₄Cl)) to form the new alkene product.\n\n3.  **Assemble the Product's Carbon Skeleton:**\n    *   By connecting the two carbon fragments at the site of the former double bonds, we get the structure of the alkene product:\n        (CH₃)₃C-CH=CH-CH₂(C₆H₄Cl)\n\n4.  **Name the Product (Ignoring Stereochemistry for a moment):**\n    *   To name the alkene, we must first identify the longest continuous carbon chain that contains the double bond.\n    *   The chain is: -CH₂-CH=CH-C(CH₃)₃. This main chain has 5 carbon atoms (a pentene).\n    *   We number the chain to give the double bond the lowest possible number. Numbering from the end closer to the double bond, we get:\n        (C₆H₄Cl)-CH₂¹-CH²=CH³-C⁴(CH₃)₃ -- This numbering is incorrect as the main chain is not properly identified.\n    *   Let's redraw and find the longest chain:\n           CH₃\n           |\n        (C₆H₄Cl)-CH₂-CH=CH-C-CH₃\n                                |\n                                CH₃\n    *   The longest chain containing the C=C is a pentene. We number from right to left to give the double bond the lowest locant (position 2):\n           ⁵CH₃\n           |\n        (C₆H₄Cl)-CH₂¹-CH²=CH³-C⁴-CH₃\n                               |\n                               CH₃\n    *   This numbering scheme gives a `pent-2-ene` main chain.\n    *   The substituents are:\n        *   A `(2-chlorophenyl)` group at position 1.\n        *   Two `methyl` groups at position 4.\n    *   Combining these parts, the base name of the product is **1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene**.\n\n5.  **Determine the Stereochemistry (E/Z Isomerism):**\n    *   The stereochemical outcome of a Wittig reaction depends on the stability of the ylide.\n    *   **Careful Point 1:** We must classify the ylide Ph₃P=CH-CH₂(C₆H₄Cl). The ylidic carbon (the one bonded to P) is attached to a hydrogen and a 2-chlorobenzyl group (-CH₂-Ar). There are no electron-withdrawing groups (like C=O, CN) directly conjugated with the ylidic carbon to delocalize the negative charge. Therefore, this is classified as an **unstabilized ylide**.\n    *   **Careful Point 2:** Wittig reactions involving unstabilized ylides are generally kinetically controlled and irreversibly form a *cis*-oxaphosphetane intermediate. This leads to the formation of the **(Z)-alkene** as the major product.\n    *   To assign the (Z) configuration, we use the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules for the substituents on each carbon of the double bond:\n        *   On carbon-2 (C²): The substituents are H and -CH₂(C₆H₄Cl). The **-CH₂(C₆H₄Cl)** group has higher priority.\n        *   On carbon-3 (C³): The substituents are H and -C(CH₃)₃. The **-C(CH₃)₃** (tert-butyl) group has higher priority.\n    *   The **(Z)-isomer** is the one where the two higher-priority groups are on the *same side* (*Zusammen*) of the double bond. In this case, the (2-chlorobenzyl) group and the (tert-butyl) group are on the same side.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe reaction is a Wittig reaction between pivalaldehyde and an unstabilized ylide. The reaction forms an alkene by joining the carbon skeletons of the two reactants and produces triphenylphosphine oxide as a byproduct. Due to the use of an unstabilized ylide, the reaction is stereoselective for the (Z)-isomer.\n\nThe final product is **(Z)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene**.\n\n<<< (Z)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene"
