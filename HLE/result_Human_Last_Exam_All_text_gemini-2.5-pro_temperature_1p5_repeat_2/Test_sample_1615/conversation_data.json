    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the maximum number of colours needed.\n\n**1. Understand the Question**\n\nThe question asks for the maximum possible chromatic number, denoted as $\\chi(G)$, for a graph $G$ with the following properties:\n*   The number of vertices is $|V(G)| = n = 12345$.\n*   The graph $G$ is not a complete graph ($G \\neq K_{12345}$).\n\nThe chromatic number $\\chi(G)$ is the minimum number of colours required for a proper vertex colouring, where no two adjacent vertices share the same colour. We need to find the highest possible value of $\\chi(G)$ among all graphs that meet these criteria.\n\n**2. Establish an Upper Bound for the Chromatic Number**\n\n*   For any graph $G$ with $n$ vertices, a trivial upper bound for the chromatic number is the number of vertices itself, so $\\chi(G) \\le n$. This is because, in the worst case, we can assign a unique colour to every vertex.\n*   A fundamental theorem in graph theory states that the chromatic number of a graph $G$ with $n$ vertices is equal to $n$ if and only if $G$ is a complete graph ($G = K_n$).\n    *   **Reasoning:** If $\\chi(G) = n$, it means that any proper colouring requires $n$ distinct colours. This implies that no two vertices can share a colour. If two vertices could share a colour, they must not be connected by an edge. But if we need $n$ colours, it means every vertex must have a different colour from every other vertex, which can only happen if every vertex is adjacent to every other vertex. Therefore, the graph must be a complete graph, $K_n$.\n*   The problem specifies that the graph $G$ is **not** a complete graph.\n*   Since $G \\neq K_{12345}$, its chromatic number must be strictly less than the number of vertices.\n*   Therefore, we can establish a strict upper bound: $\\chi(G) < 12345$, which means $\\chi(G) \\le 12344$.\n\n**3. Verify if this Upper Bound is Achievable**\n\nNow we need to determine if there exists a graph $G$ that has 12345 vertices, is not a complete graph, and has a chromatic number of exactly 12344. If we can construct such a graph, then 12344 is indeed the maximum possible value.\n\nLet's construct a candidate graph $G^*$:\n*   **Vertices:** Let the set of vertices be $V = \\{v_1, v_2, \\ldots, v_{12345}\\}$.\n*   **Edges:** Consider the subgraph formed by the first 12344 vertices, $\\{v_1, \\ldots, v_{12344}\\}$. Let's make this subgraph a complete graph, $K_{12344}$. This means an edge exists between every pair of vertices $(v_i, v_j)$ where $1 \\le i < j \\le 12344$.\n*   **The last vertex:** Let the final vertex, $v_{12345}$, be an isolated vertex with no edges connecting it to any other vertex.\n\nLet's check if this graph $G^*$ meets the problem's conditions:\n1.  **Number of vertices:** The graph $G^*$ has $12344 + 1 = 12345$ vertices. This is correct.\n2.  **Is it a complete graph?** No. For a graph to be complete, every vertex must be connected to every other vertex. In our graph $G^*$, the vertex $v_{12345}$ is not connected to $v_1$ (or any other vertex). Thus, $G^*$ is not the complete graph $K_{12345}$. This is correct.\n\nNow, let's find the chromatic number of our constructed graph $G^*$:\n*   The graph $G^*$ is a disjoint union of two components: a complete graph $K_{12344}$ and a single isolated vertex $K_1$.\n*   The chromatic number of a disjoint graph is the maximum of the chromatic numbers of its components.\n*   The chromatic number of the complete graph $K_{12344}$ is $\\chi(K_{12344}) = 12344$.\n*   The chromatic number of an isolated vertex is $\\chi(K_1) = 1$.\n*   Therefore, the chromatic number of our graph is $\\chi(G^*) = \\max(12344, 1) = 12344$.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\n*   We have proven that for any graph $G$ with 12345 vertices that is not complete, the number of colours needed is at most 12344.\n*   We have constructed a specific graph that satisfies the conditions and requires exactly 12344 colours.\n*   Therefore, the maximum number of colours that we need to colour such a graph is 12344.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   The mention of the maximum degree $\\Delta(G)$ in the question is ancillary information and not required for the solution, as the argument based on the definition of a complete graph is more direct and powerful than using Brooks's Theorem.\n*   The key is realizing the strict relationship between a graph being complete and its chromatic number being equal to its number of vertices.\n*   It is crucial to both establish an upper bound and show that the bound is tight (achievable) by providing a concrete example. The graph $K_{12344} \\cup K_1$ serves this purpose. Another valid example is taking $K_{12345}$ and removing a single edge.\n\nFinal Answer Calculation:\nNumber of vertices $n = 12345$.\nThe graph is not $K_n$.\nMaximum $\\chi(G)$ must be less than $n$.\nSo, maximum $\\chi(G) = n - 1 = 12345 - 1 = 12344$.\n\n<<<12344>>>"
