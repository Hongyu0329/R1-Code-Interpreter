    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of expected peaks in the 1H NMR spectrum of the given molecule.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the chemical name and draw the structure.**\n\nThe molecule is **1,3,5-tri[((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl)methyl]-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene**.\n\n*   **Central Core:** The base name is \"benzene\". The locants indicate the substitution pattern.\n    *   `2,4,6-trimethyl`: There are three methyl (-CH3) groups on the benzene ring at positions 2, 4, and 6.\n    *   `1,3,5-tri[...]`: There are three identical, large substituent groups at positions 1, 3, and 5.\n\n*   **Substituent Group:** The group in the brackets `[((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl)methyl]`.\n    *   `...methyl]`: This indicates a methylene (-CH2-) group acting as a linker between the benzene ring and the rest of the substituent.\n    *   `...indazol-2-yl)`: The -CH2- linker is attached to the nitrogen atom at position 2 (N2) of an indazole derivative.\n    *   The indazole derivative is `(4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazole`. This is a complex heterocyclic system. Analysis of the name reveals it is a derivative of camphor, where the C2-C3 part of the camphor skeleton has been converted into a pyrazole ring. Let's call this chiral unit \"camphor-pyrazole\" or **CP**.\n        *   It is a bicyclic system (due to `4,7-methano`) fused to a pyrazole ring.\n        *   It contains three methyl groups: one at position C7, and two `gem`-dimethyls at C8 (the methano bridge).\n        *   It is chiral, with specified stereochemistry at the bridgehead carbons C4 and C7 as `(4S,7R)`. All three CP units in the molecule are of this same enantiomeric form.\n        *   The pyrazole ring has a proton at C3 and a proton at N1 (as it's a `2H-indazole` with the substituent on N2).\n\nThe overall structure consists of a central benzene ring substituted at positions 1, 3, 5 with `-CH2-CP` groups and at positions 2, 4, 6 with -CH3 groups.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the symmetry of the molecule.**\n\n*   The central core, a 1,3,5-trisubstituted-2,4,6-trisubstituted benzene, has a C3 rotational axis of symmetry perpendicular to the plane of the ring.\n*   The three substituents at positions 1, 3, and 5 are identical (`-CH2-CP`).\n*   The three substituents at positions 2, 4, and 6 are identical (-CH3).\n*   Since the substituent `CP` units are chiral, the molecule lacks any mirror planes or a center of inversion.\n*   The molecule as a whole possesses **C3 symmetry**.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the number of chemically non-equivalent protons.**\n\nThe C3 symmetry implies that the three `-CH2-CP` \"arms\" are chemically equivalent, and the three core -CH3 groups are also chemically equivalent. We only need to find the number of unique proton environments within one \"arm\" and the core, and then sum them up. We assume that chemically non-equivalent protons will produce distinct signals (peaks), ignoring accidental equivalence.\n\nLet's count the signals from each distinct part of the molecule:\n\n**Part A: The Central Core (2,4,6-trimethylbenzene part)**\n1.  **-CH3 groups:** The three methyl groups at positions 2, 4, and 6 are equivalent due to the C3 rotation. They will produce a single signal.\n    *   Number of signals = **1**.\n\n**Part B: The Methylene Linkers (-CH2-)**\n2.  **-CH2- groups:** The three -CH2- linkers are equivalent by C3 symmetry. We need to analyze the two protons within one methylene group.\n    *   Each -CH2- group is attached to the achiral benzene ring on one side and a chiral CP unit on the other. This makes the methylene carbon a prochiral center, and its two geminal protons are **diastereotopic**.\n    *   Diastereotopic protons are chemically non-equivalent and will give separate signals.\n    *   Therefore, the methylene protons give rise to two distinct signals. (All three \"Ha\" protons are equivalent by C3, and all three \"Hb\" protons are equivalent by C3).\n    *   Number of signals = **2**.\n\n**Part C: One Camphor-Pyrazole (CP) Unit**\nThe CP unit is chiral and has no internal symmetry. Therefore, every proton (or set of protons in a freely rotating methyl group) will be in a unique chemical environment.\n3.  **Pyrazole H3 proton:** A single proton on the pyrazole ring. -> **1 signal**.\n4.  **Pyrazole N1-H proton:** The proton on the N1 nitrogen. -> **1 signal**.\n5.  **Bridgehead H4 proton:** A single methine proton at the C4 bridgehead. -> **1 signal**.\n6.  **C5 methylene protons:** The two protons on C5 (exo and endo) are diastereotopic. -> **2 signals**.\n7.  **C6 methylene protons:** The two protons on C6 are also diastereotopic and are in a different environment from the C5 protons (C6 is adjacent to C7-Me, while C5 is adjacent to C4-H). -> **2 signals**.\n8.  **C7-methyl group:** The three protons of this methyl group are equivalent due to rotation. -> **1 signal**.\n9.  **C8-gem-dimethyl groups:** The two methyl groups on the C8 bridge are diastereotopic because of the overall chirality and lack of local symmetry. They are non-equivalent. -> **2 signals**.\n\nTotal signals from one CP unit = 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 2 = **10 signals**.\n\n**Step 4: Sum the signals from all parts.**\n\nTotal number of expected peaks = (Signals from Core) + (Signals from Linkers) + (Signals from one CP unit)\nTotal number of peaks = 1 + 2 + 10 = **13**.\n\nThe 13 distinct signals are:\n*   1 signal for the 9H of the three core -CH3 groups.\n*   2 signals for the 6H of the three diastereotopic -CH2- linkers (3H for Ha, 3H for Hb).\n*   10 signals from the protons within the CP unit (replicated for all three equivalent units).\n\nThe final answer is 13.\n\n<<<I>>>"
