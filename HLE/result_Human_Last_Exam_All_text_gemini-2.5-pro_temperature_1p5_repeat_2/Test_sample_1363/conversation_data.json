    "This question asks to identify the specific dance from the provided list where overturning a reverse turn is fundamentally incompatible with the dance's core technique.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understanding the Terms:**\n    *   **Reverse Turn:** A standard figure in ballroom dancing that turns to the left.\n    *   **Overturn:** To turn more than the standard amount prescribed for a figure. For example, turning a full circle (360°) where only a three-quarters turn (270°) is standard.\n    *   **Disregarding the Technique:** This is the crucial part. It means that the act of overturning would force the dancer to violate the foundational principles and character of that specific dance.\n\n2.  **Analyzing the Dance Choices:**\n    *   **A. Viennese Waltz, B. English Waltz, D. Slow Foxtrot, E. Quickstep:** These four dances are known as \"swing\" dances. Their technique is built upon principles of momentum, body swing, sway, and rise & fall to create continuous, flowing movement.\n        *   In these dances, overturning a turn is not only possible but often used in advanced choreography to create a more dynamic or dramatic effect.\n        *   While overturning requires more skill and control, it doesn't necessarily violate the core technique. In fact, it can be seen as an extension of the principles of swing and rotation inherent in these dances. For instance, in a Waltz, adding more rotation can be achieved by using more sway and drive, which are consistent with Waltz technique. In Quickstep, speed and momentum naturally lend themselves to overturned figures.\n\n    *   **C. European Tango:** The Tango is fundamentally different from the swing dances. Its technique is characterized by:\n        *   **No Rise and Fall:** The dance is kept on a level plane, with bent knees absorbing movement.\n        *   **No Sway:** The upper body is held still and erect, without the side-to-side sway seen in the waltzes and foxtrot.\n        *   **Staccato Action:** Movements are sharp, clipped, and decisive, rather than soft and continuous.\n        *   **Specific Turns:** Turns in Tango are executed more like \"walking around a corner.\" The feet are kept in contact with the floor, and the turn is sharp and contained, not created from a flowing swing.\n\n3.  **Connecting the Analysis to the Question:**\n    *   Let's consider overturning a Reverse Turn in the Tango. To generate the extra rotation needed for an overturn, a dancer would almost inevitably have to introduce elements that are forbidden in Tango technique.\n    *   They would likely need to **rise** onto the ball of the foot to spin more easily, which introduces **rise and fall**.\n    *   They would likely need to use body **sway** to create momentum, violating another core principle.\n    *   The resulting movement would lose its sharp, **staccato** quality and become a continuous, swinging spin, which is characteristic of a Waltz or Foxtrot, not a Tango.\n    *   Therefore, to overturn a reverse turn in Tango, one must disregard the fundamental techniques that define the dance itself. The action of overturning is antithetical to the character of the Tango.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nIn the four swing dances, overturning is a variation that builds upon the existing technique. In the European Tango, overturning requires a complete break from its foundational technical rules.\n\n<<<C>>>"
