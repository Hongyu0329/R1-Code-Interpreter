    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the User's Question**\nThe user is asking for a specific, numerical count of a particular ballet step.\n*   **Choreography:** \"In the Middle, Somewhere Elevated\"\n*   **Choreographer:** William Forsythe\n*   **Scene:** The \"Jete Woman\" solo (an informal name for a key variation).\n*   **Performer:** Svetlana Gileva\n*   **Company:** Semperoper Ballett\n*   **Year:** 2015\n*   **Movement to be counted:** \"pas de Balanchine\"\n\n**Step 2: Define the Key Term: \"pas de Balanchine\"**\nThis is the most critical point of the analysis.\n*   **Not a Formal Step:** \"Pas de Balanchine\" is not a formal, officially codified step in the lexicon of classical ballet, unlike a *pas de bourrée* or a *grand jeté*.\n*   **Colloquial Term:** It is a colloquial or studio term used by dancers, teachers, and ballet masters.\n*   **What it Describes:** It generally refers to a specific type of stylized movement characteristic of the choreographer George Balanchine. Most commonly, it describes a quick *pas de bourrée dessous* (back-side-front) landing in a deep fourth position lunge with the back leg straight and the front leg bent, often accompanied by a specific, dynamic use of the arms and upper body (epaulement). However, its definition can vary between coaches and schools.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Choreography and Choreographer**\n*   **Choreographer's Style:** William Forsythe is a post-neoclassical choreographer. His work is known for deconstructing the vocabulary of classical ballet and the neoclassical style pioneered by George Balanchine.\n*   **\"In the Middle, Somewhere Elevated\":** This ballet is a prime example of Forsythe's style. He takes classical steps and pushes them to their physical limits, altering their speed, alignment, and sequence.\n*   **Relationship to Balanchine:** Forsythe's work shows a clear influence from Balanchine, but it is an evolution or even a subversion of it, not a direct imitation. He uses the *principles* of Balanchine (speed, musicality, off-balance positions) but creates his own distinct vocabulary.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the Feasibility of Counting the Step in this Context**\n*   **Subjectivity:** Because \"pas de Balanchine\" is not a formally defined step, any count would be highly subjective. One person might count any deep lunge as such, while another might only count a lunge that is preceded by a very specific sequence of steps.\n*   **Choreographic Intent:** William Forsythe did not choreograph a \"pas de Balanchine\" into his ballet. He choreographed a series of lunges, off-balance movements, and dynamic transitions that are entirely his own creation, even if they are stylistically reminiscent of Balanchine's work.\n*   **The \"Jete Woman\" Solo:** This specific variation is filled with rapid, athletic movements, including numerous lunges, extended lines, and off-balance poses. Trying to isolate and label one of these complex movements with a colloquial term from a different choreographer's style is an interpretive act, not a factual count.\n\n### Conclusion of Analysis\n\nTo ask how many \"pas de Balanchines\" are in a Forsythe ballet is similar to asking how many Shakespearean sonnets are in a poem by E.E. Cummings. While Cummings was influenced by the history of poetry, his work has its own structure and rules.\n\nTechnically, since \"pas de Balanchine\" is a term for a step in the style of George Balanchine, and this choreography is by William Forsythe, there are no official \"pas de Balanchines\" in the work. The movements are Forsythe's. Therefore, the only objectively correct answer is zero.\n\n<<<0>>>"
