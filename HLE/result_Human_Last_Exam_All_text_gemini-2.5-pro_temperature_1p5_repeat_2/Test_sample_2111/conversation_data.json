    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Main Figure:** Fernand Braudel, a historian known for his emphasis on long-term, large-scale, global history (*la longue dur√©e*).\n    *   **Quoted Figure:** Paul Morand, a French author.\n    *   **Core Assertion:** A specific \"conceptual entity\" should be \"inscribed within a sphere.\"\n    *   **Key Clue:** This entity is \"exemplified by the symbol of a nation.\"\n    *   **The Metaphor:** The \"sphere\" represents a global or worldwide context, which is central to Braudel's own historical methodology.\n\n2.  **Locate the Source:** The quotation is found in the introduction to Fernand Braudel's influential work, *The Structures of Everyday Life: The Limits of the Possible*, which is the first volume of his three-volume series *Civilization and Capitalism, 15th-18th Century*.\n\n3.  **Examine the Specific Quotation and its Context:**\n    *   Braudel is arguing against studying the history of a single nation in isolation. He believes that to truly understand any part of the world, it must be viewed within the larger global system.\n    *   He writes: \"Everything, a nation's literature, its politics, its social classes, its economy, and its very rich men, must be put back into the global picture.\"\n    *   He then introduces the quote from Paul Morand to support this point: \"'**A history of France**, an art of living... should be inscribed on a sphere so as to be understood,' said Paul Morand.\"\n\n4.  **Identify the Conceptual Entity:**\n    *   The question asks for the \"conceptual entity\" that Morand asserts should be inscribed on a sphere.\n    *   Morand's quote provides a direct example: \"**A history of France**.\"\n    *   This example perfectly aligns with the clue in the question that the entity is \"exemplified by the symbol of a nation.\" France is the nation, and its history is the specific entity being discussed.\n    *   Generalizing from Morand's specific example (\"A history of France\"), the conceptual entity is the **history of a nation**.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider:\n\n*   **Attribution:** It is crucial to note that while Braudel uses the quote to make his point, the original assertion belongs to Paul Morand.\n*   **Braudel's Elaboration:** Braudel broadens Morand's point by listing other national aspects (literature, politics, economy) that also require a global context. However, the direct answer to what Morand's quote identifies is \"history.\"\n*   **The Metaphor's Meaning:** The \"sphere\" is not a literal object but a metaphor for the interconnected, global context necessary for proper historical understanding. Inscribing a nation's history on this sphere means viewing it not as a standalone story but as one part of a much larger, worldwide narrative.\n\n### Final Conclusion:\n\nBased on the direct analysis of the quote from Paul Morand as cited by Fernand Braudel, the conceptual entity that should be inscribed within a sphere is the history of a nation.\n\n<<<the history of a nation>>>"
