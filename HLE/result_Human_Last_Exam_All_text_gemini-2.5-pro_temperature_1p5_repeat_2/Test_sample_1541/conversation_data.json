    "Answering this question requires a careful analysis of the problem's constraints and the goal of achieving maximum memory efficiency in a C program.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   **Input:** A string `s` representing a sum of numbers (e.g., \"3+1+4+1+2\").\n    *   **Numbers Involved:** The problem statement is slightly ambiguous. The first paragraph mentions \"1, 2, and 3\", but the input description and an example (\"3+4\") confirm that the numbers are from the set {1, 2, 3, 4}. We must account for all four.\n    *   **Task:** Rearrange the numbers in the sum into non-decreasing order and print the new sum. For \"3+1+4+1+2\", the output should be \"1+1+2+3+4\".\n    *   **Constraint:** The input string length is at most 1000 characters.\n    *   **Objective:** Write the most memory-efficient C program and determine the total memory `m` (in bytes) used by its variables.\n\n2.  **Algorithm Selection for Memory Efficiency:**\n    *   A naive approach would be to parse the string, store the numbers in an integer array, sort the array, and then build the output string. The maximum number of summands in a 1000-character string is 501 (e.g., \"1+1+...+1\"). An array `int nums[501]` would consume `501 * 4 = 2004` bytes, which is not optimal.\n    *   A far more memory-efficient method is **Counting Sort**. Since we know the numbers are limited to {1, 2, 3, 4}, we don't need to store the numbers themselves. We only need to count the occurrences of each number. This requires just four integer counters.\n\n3.  **Designing the Memory-Efficient C Program:**\n\n    *   **Variable Declaration:** To solve the problem using counting sort, we need the following variables:\n        1.  **Input Buffer:** A character array to store the input string. Since the maximum length is 1000, we need an array of size 1001 to accommodate the string and the null terminator (`\\0`).\n            *   `char s[1001];`\n        2.  **Counters:** Four integer variables to store the frequency of the numbers '1', '2', '3', and '4'.\n            *   `int count1, count2, count3, count4;`\n        3.  **Loop Iterator:** A single integer variable for iterating through the input string.\n            *   `int i;`\n\n    *   **Minimizing Additional Variables:** To keep memory usage at a minimum, we should avoid any extra variables.\n        *   We can avoid using `strlen()` from `<string.h>` and the extra variable to store the length by looping until the null terminator is found (`for (i = 0; s[i] != '\\0'; i++)`).\n        *   When printing the result, a simple approach might use a flag variable to handle the placement of '+' signs (i.e., not printing a '+' before the first number). However, a more memory-efficient printing logic can be devised to avoid this extra flag variable, saving 1 byte (for a `char` flag) or 4 bytes (for an `int` flag).\n\n4.  **Implementation Logic:**\n    1.  Declare the variables: `char s[1001]`, `int count1=0, count2=0, count3=0, count4=0`, and `int i`.\n    2.  Read the input string into `s` using `scanf`.\n    3.  Iterate through the string `s`. Inside the loop, check if the character `s[i]` is '1', '2', '3', or '4', and increment the corresponding counter. The '+' characters are simply skipped.\n    4.  Print the sorted sum directly, without building a new string in memory. Use a logic that avoids a state flag. For example:\n        *   A boolean-like flag `is_first_term` is initialized to true.\n        *   Have four loops, one for each number from 1 to 4.\n        *   Inside each loop (e.g., for `count1`): if `is_first_term` is true, print the number (\"1\") and set the flag to false. Otherwise, print the separator and the number (\"+1\").\n        *   This ensures the '+' is placed correctly.\n    *   *Correction for memory efficiency:* As analyzed in the thought process, we can even avoid a flag variable by handling the first term as a special case, thus reducing memory by 1 byte.\n\n5.  **Final Memory Calculation:**\n\n    We calculate the total memory `m` by summing the sizes of the variables required for the most efficient implementation. We assume a standard environment where `sizeof(char)` is 1 byte and `sizeof(int)` is 4 bytes.\n\n    *   **Input buffer `s`:** `1001 * sizeof(char)` = 1001 * 1 = **1001 bytes**.\n    *   **Four counters `count1, count2, count3, count4`:** `4 * sizeof(int)` = 4 * 4 = **16 bytes**.\n    *   **Loop iterator `i`:** `1 * sizeof(int)` = 1 * 4 = **4 bytes**.\n\n    Total Memory `m` = (Memory for `s`) + (Memory for counters) + (Memory for iterator)\n    `m` = 1001 + 16 + 4\n    `m` = 1021 bytes.\n\n### Careful Points Checklist\n\n*   **Problem Ambiguity:** Noticed and resolved the ambiguity between \"1, 2, 3\" and \"1, 2, 3, 4\" by using the example case \"3+4\" as clarification.\n*   **Algorithm Choice:** Selected Counting Sort over a general-purpose sort to significantly reduce memory.\n*   **Buffer Size:** Correctly allocated `N+1` bytes for a string of maximum length `N` to account for the null terminator.\n*   **Variable Minimization:** Consciously designed the logic to avoid unnecessary variables like a length holder (`len`) or a printing flag (`is_first_term`), achieving the absolute minimum memory footprint for this algorithm.\n*   **Data Type Sizes:** Used standard data type sizes (`char`=1 byte, `int`=4 bytes) common in competitive programming platforms.\n\nThis step-by-step analysis leads to a memory-optimized solution and a precise calculation of the memory used.\n\n1021"
