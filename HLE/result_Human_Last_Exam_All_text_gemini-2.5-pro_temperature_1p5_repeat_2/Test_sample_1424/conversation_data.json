    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, highlighting the careful points, leading to the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Core Concepts**\n\n*   **Feynman Path Integral:** This formalism calculates quantum mechanical amplitudes by summing over all possible \"histories\" or paths a system can take between initial and final states. Each path is weighted by a phase factor $e^{iS/\\hbar}$, where $S$ is the classical action of that path.\n*   **Green's Function (Propagator):** In quantum field theory, a Green's function $G(x, y)$ describes the amplitude for a particle or excitation to propagate from spacetime point $y$ to spacetime point $x$.\n*   **Bare Green's Function ($G_0$):** This is the Green's function for a *non-interacting* system. The system's dynamics are governed by a \"free\" or \"bare\" Hamiltonian, $H_0$, which is typically quadratic in the fields.\n*   **Single-Particle Energy Eigenvalues ($\\epsilon_k$):** These are the energy levels of a single particle in the non-interacting system. They are the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian operator $H_0$ in the single-particle sector, such that $H_0|k\\rangle = \\epsilon_k|k\\rangle$, where $|k\\rangle$ is the single-particle eigenstate (e.g., a plane wave with momentum $k$).\n\n**Step 2: Defining the Green's Function from the Path Integral**\n\nThe two-point Green's function in the path integral formalism is derived from the generating functional $Z[J]$, where $J$ is an external source. For a non-interacting theory (described by the action $S_0$), the generating functional is:\n$Z_0[J] = \\int \\mathcal{D}\\phi^* \\mathcal{D}\\phi \\, \\exp\\left(iS_0[\\phi^*, \\phi] + i \\int d^4x (J^*\\phi + \\phi^*J)\\right)$\n\nThe Green's function is the vacuum expectation value of the time-ordered product of fields, obtained by taking functional derivatives with respect to the source $J$ and setting $J=0$:\n$G_0(x_1, x_2) = \\langle T[\\phi(x_1)\\phi^\\dagger(x_2)] \\rangle_0 = \\left. \\frac{1}{Z_0[0]} \\frac{\\delta}{i\\delta J^*(x_1)} \\frac{\\delta}{i\\delta J(x_2)} Z_0[J] \\right|_{J=0}$\n\n**Step 3: Connecting the Action to the Green's Function Operator**\n\nThe key insight is how the Green's function relates to the action. The non-interacting action $S_0$ is quadratic in the fields and can be written in a general operator form. For a typical many-body system, the Lagrangian density is $\\mathcal{L}_0 = \\phi^* (i\\partial_t - H_0) \\phi$.\nThe action is $S_0 = \\int dt d^3x \\, \\phi^*(x,t) (i\\partial_t - H_0) \\phi(x,t)$.\n\nLet's define the operator $\\mathcal{O} = (i\\partial_t - H_0)$. The action is $S_0 = \\int \\phi^* \\mathcal{O} \\phi$. A fundamental result of Gaussian path integrals is that the Green's function is the inverse of the operator in the quadratic action.\nTherefore:\n$G_0 = \\mathcal{O}^{-1} = (i\\partial_t - H_0)^{-1}$\n\n**Careful Point 1:** This is an operator equation. To find the explicit functional form, we need to represent this operator in a basis where it is diagonal.\n\n**Step 4: Diagonalization via Fourier Transform**\n\nThe operator $(i\\partial_t - H_0)$ is not diagonal in the real-space representation because $H_0$ typically contains spatial derivatives (like $-\\nabla^2/2m$) and mixes different spatial points. However, it can be diagonalized by transforming to a basis of its eigenfunctions.\n\n1.  **Spatial Transform:** The single-particle Hamiltonian $H_0$ is diagonal in the basis of its eigenstates $|k\\rangle$, with eigenvalues $\\epsilon_k$. A Fourier transform from position $\\mathbf{x}$ to momentum $\\mathbf{k}$ diagonalizes $H_0$.\n2.  **Temporal Transform:** The time derivative operator $i\\partial_t$ is diagonalized by a Fourier transform from time $t$ to frequency $\\omega$. In this basis, $i\\partial_t \\rightarrow \\omega$ (setting $\\hbar=1$).\n\nApplying these Fourier transforms to the operator equation $G_0 = (i\\partial_t - H_0)^{-1}$:\n*   The operator $i\\partial_t$ becomes the number $\\omega$.\n*   The operator $H_0$ becomes the number $\\epsilon_k$.\n\nThe equation in the momentum-frequency $(\\mathbf{k}, \\omega)$ space becomes a simple algebraic equation:\n$G_0(\\mathbf{k}, \\omega) = (\\omega - \\epsilon_k)^{-1} = \\frac{1}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k}$\n\n**Careful Point 2:** The expression $1/(\\omega - \\epsilon_k)$ is singular when $\\omega = \\epsilon_k$. The path integral formalism, through the requirement of time-ordering, provides a specific prescription for handling this pole. This ensures causality (i.e., propagation only forward in time for particles and backward for anti-particles). This is handled by adding an infinitesimal imaginary part, $i\\eta$ (where $\\eta \\to 0^+$), to the denominator.\n\n**Step 5: Incorporating Causality (The $i\\eta$ Prescription)**\n\nThe correct Feynman propagator requires a specific prescription for the pole, which depends on whether the energy level $\\epsilon_k$ is occupied or unoccupied relative to the Fermi energy $\\epsilon_F$ (for fermions at zero temperature).\n\n*   For an unoccupied state (a particle state, $\\epsilon_k > \\epsilon_F$), the pole is shifted to $\\epsilon_k - i\\eta$.\n*   For an occupied state (a hole state, $\\epsilon_k < \\epsilon_F$), the pole is shifted to $\\epsilon_k + i\\eta$.\n\nThis leads to the full expression for the causal time-ordered bare Green's function:\n$G_0(\\mathbf{k}, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\eta \\cdot \\text{sgn}(\\epsilon_k - \\epsilon_F)}$\n\nwhere $\\text{sgn}(x)$ is the sign function.\n\n### Final Conclusion on Functional Dependence\n\nThe functional dependence of the bare Green's function $G_0$ on the single-particle energy eigenvalues $\\epsilon_k$ is revealed in the frequency-momentum representation. The eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$ determines the **location of the pole** of the Green's function on the real frequency (energy) axis. Specifically, the dependence is of the form **$(\\omega - \\epsilon_k)^{-1}$**, with the pole infinitesimally displaced from the real axis to ensure causality.\n\n<<<The functional dependence of the bare Green's function in frequency-momentum space, $G_0(\\mathbf{k}, \\omega)$, on the single-particle energy eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$ is given by the expression $G_0(\\mathbf{k}, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\eta \\cdot \\text{sgn}(\\epsilon_k - \\epsilon_F)}$, where $\\epsilon_k$ sets the real part of the pole location.>>>"
