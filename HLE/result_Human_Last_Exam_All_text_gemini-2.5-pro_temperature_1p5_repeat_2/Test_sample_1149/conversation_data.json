    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of depressions in the lacrimal recess of *Irritator challengeri*.\n\n### Step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Identify the anatomical subject:** The question asks about a specific feature on the skull of the dinosaur *Irritator challengeri*.\n2.  **Define the key terms:**\n    *   ***Irritator challengeri***: A species of spinosaurid theropod dinosaur known from a nearly complete skull found in Brazil.\n    *   **Lacrimal bone:** A skull bone that sits in front of the eye socket (orbit) and forms part of the margin of the antorbital fenestra (an opening in the skull in front of the eye).\n    *   **Lacrimal recess:** A depression or fossa located on the lacrimal bone. In many theropod dinosaurs, this recess is pneumatized, meaning it has openings (foramina) that connected to the dinosaur's air-sac system.\n    *   **Depression:** An indented or hollowed-out area. In this context, it refers to the distinct pits or openings within the larger lacrimal recess.\n\n3.  **Consult the primary scientific literature:** To answer a specific anatomical question like this, it is crucial to refer to the formal scientific description of the fossil. The most comprehensive study of the *Irritator challengeri* skull is the 2002 monograph by Sues, Frey, Martill, and Scott, titled \"Irritator challengeri, a spinosaurid (Dinosauria: Theropoda) from the Lower Cretaceous of Brazil.\"\n\n4.  **Analyze the description of the lacrimal bone:** In this paper, the authors provide a detailed, bone-by-bone description of the skull. When describing the lacrimal bone, they note the presence of a large depression on its lateral (outer) surface, which is part of the antorbital fossa.\n\n5.  **Locate the specific detail about the lacrimal recess:** The authors specifically identify a smaller, distinct depression within the posterodorsal (upper-rear) part of the antorbital fossa on the lacrimal. This is the lacrimal recess.\n\n6.  **Count the depressions contained within the lacrimal recess:** The Sues et al. (2002) paper states that the lacrimal recess in *Irritator challengeri* contains features related to the pneumatic system. They explicitly describe and illustrate that the lacrimal recess contains **two** large pneumatic foramina (openings). These foramina are the \"depressions\" housed within the larger recess.\n\n### Careful points:\n\n*   **Source Authority:** The answer relies on the most detailed scientific description of the *Irritator* holotype skull, making it the most reliable source of information.\n*   **Terminology:** It's important to understand the hierarchy of the features. The lacrimal recess is itself a depression, but the question asks what it *contains*. The features it contains are two smaller depressions, specifically pneumatic foramina.\n*   **Specificity:** The number of such features can vary between different dinosaur species, even closely related ones. The answer must be specific to *Irritator challengeri*.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nBased on the detailed anatomical description provided in the primary scientific literature, the lacrimal recess of *Irritator challengeri* contains two distinct depressions, which are pneumatic foramina.\n\n<<<2>>>"
