    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question and answer choices.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Core Question:**\nThe question asks for the primary mechanism that explains two outcomes for duplicate genes:\n*   **Retention:** Why are both copies of the duplicated gene kept in the genome instead of one being lost?\n*   **Divergence:** Why do the two copies become different from each other over evolutionary time?\n\n**2. Analyze Each Answer Choice:**\n\n*   **A. Gene conversion:** This is a process of non-reciprocal genetic exchange where one DNA sequence replaces a homologous sequence. In the context of duplicate genes, gene conversion tends to make the two copies *more similar* to each other, a process called concerted evolution. This works *against* divergence and long-term retention of distinct functions. Therefore, it is not the mechanism responsible for retention and divergence.\n\n*   **B. Pseudogenization:** This is the most common fate of a duplicate gene. One copy accumulates disabling mutations (like nonsense or frameshift mutations) and becomes a non-functional \"pseudogene.\" This is a mechanism of gene *loss*, not *retention*. The question specifically asks about how genes are retained.\n\n*   **C. Neofunctionalization:** In this model, after duplication, one copy maintains the original ancestral function, while the other copy is free to accumulate mutations. One of these mutations might luckily result in a new, beneficial function. Natural selection would then preserve this new function, leading to the *retention* of both copies and their *divergence* (as their functions and sequences are now different). This is a valid and important mechanism.\n\n*   **D. Subfunctionalization:** Also known as the Duplication-Degeneration-Complementation (DDC) model. This model proposes that the original, single-copy gene had multiple distinct functions or expression patterns (i.e., it was pleiotropic). After duplication, each copy can accumulate degenerative mutations that knock out *different* subfunctions. For example, copy A loses subfunction 2, and copy B loses subfunction 1. Now, both genes are required to carry out the complete set of the original gene's functions. This \"complementation\" ensures the *retention* of both copies and leads to their *divergence* as they become specialized.\n\n*   **E. Adaptive radiation:** This is a macroevolutionary concept describing the rapid diversification of a single lineage into many new species that fill different ecological niches. While gene duplication can provide the raw genetic material that fuels adaptive radiation, it is not itself a *molecular mechanism* for retaining and diverging individual genes. This answer is at the wrong biological scale.\n\n**3. Compare the Strongest Candidates (C and D):**\n\n*   Both neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization are accepted models that explain the retention and divergence of duplicate genes.\n*   The key difference lies in the driving force and probability.\n    *   **Neofunctionalization** requires the rare event of a mutation creating a brand-new, beneficial function.\n    *   **Subfunctionalization** relies on the much more common event of losing a function through degenerative mutations. By partitioning existing functions, it provides a passive mechanism for preserving both copies under purifying selection, as losing either one would be detrimental.\n*   Because it is based on more common mutational events (loss-of-function) rather than rarer ones (gain-of-new-function), many evolutionary biologists consider subfunctionalization to be a more frequent, and thus **\"more likely,\"** initial step for the retention of duplicate genes. It essentially provides a \"safe harbor\" for duplicated genes, preventing their immediate loss and giving them time to potentially evolve new functions later.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nSubfunctionalization provides a powerful and common mechanism for preserving duplicate genes immediately after a duplication event by partitioning the ancestral functions. This process relies on relatively common degenerative mutations. While neofunctionalization is also a crucial long-term outcome, subfunctionalization is often considered the most likely initial mechanism responsible for ensuring the retention that allows divergence to occur.\n\n<<<D>>>"
