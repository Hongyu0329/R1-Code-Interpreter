    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the properties of the function `f`\n\nLet the given functional equation be $f(f(x)) = e^x$.\nThe function $g(x) = e^x$ is continuous and strictly increasing. Its domain is $\\mathbb{R}$ and its range is $(0, \\infty)$. We are looking for continuous functions $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ that satisfy the equation.\n\n**1. Injectivity of `f`**\nSuppose $f(x_1) = f(x_2)$. Applying the function $f$ to both sides, we get $f(f(x_1)) = f(f(x_2))$.\nThis implies $e^{x_1} = e^{x_2}$. Since the exponential function is one-to-one, we must have $x_1 = x_2$.\nTherefore, $f$ must be an injective (one-to-one) function.\n\n**2. Monotonicity of `f`**\nA continuous and injective function defined on $\\mathbb{R}$ must be strictly monotonic (either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing). We analyze these two cases.\n\n*   **Case A: `f` is strictly increasing.** If $f$ is strictly increasing, then the composition $f \\circ f$ is also strictly increasing. Since $e^x$ is strictly increasing, this case is possible.\n*   **Case B: `f` is strictly decreasing.** If $f$ is strictly decreasing, then the composition $f \\circ f$ is strictly increasing (the composition of two decreasing functions is increasing). Since $e^x$ is strictly increasing, this case is also potentially possible.\n\nWe need to analyze these two cases separately.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the case where `f` is strictly decreasing\n\nLet's assume there exists a continuous and strictly decreasing function $f$ satisfying $f(f(x)) = e^x$.\n\n1.  **Fixed Points:** A fixed point of $f$ would be a number $p$ such that $f(p)=p$. If such a point exists, then $f(f(p)) = f(p) = p$. The equation $f(f(x)) = e^x$ would then imply $e^p = p$. The equation $e^x = x$ has no real solutions (since $e^x > x$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$). Therefore, $f$ cannot have any fixed points.\n\n2.  **A Contradiction:**\n    *   Let $c = f(0)$. Since $f$ has no fixed points, $c \\neq 0$.\n    *   Applying the functional equation at $x=0$, we get $f(f(0)) = e^0 = 1$, which means $f(c) = 1$. Since $f$ has no fixed points, $c \\neq 1$.\n    *   Let's analyze the relative positions of $0$ and $c$.\n    *   **Subcase 2.1: $c > 0$.** Since $f$ is strictly decreasing and $c \\ne 1$, we must have $c>1$. If $c \\in (0,1)$, then $c>0 \\implies f(c) < f(0) \\implies 1 < c$, a contradiction. Thus we must have $c>1$. We now have the points ordered as $0 < 1 < c$. Applying the strictly decreasing function $f$ reverses the inequalities: $f(0) > f(1) > f(c)$.\n    *   Substituting the known values, this becomes $c > f(1) > 1$.\n    *   We can find $f(1)$ by applying the functional equation at $x=c$: $f(f(c)) = e^c$, which means $f(1) = e^c$.\n    *   The inequality becomes $c > e^c > 1$. The inequality $e^c > 1$ is true since $c > 1$. However, the inequality $c > e^c$ is false for all real $c$ (as seen by studying the function $h(x)=e^x-x$). This leads to a contradiction.\n\n    *   **Subcase 2.2: $c < 0$.** Since $f$ is strictly decreasing, $c < 0 \\implies f(c) > f(0) \\implies 1 > c$. This is consistent.\n    *   We have the points ordered as $c < 0 < 1$. Applying the strictly decreasing function $f$ reverses the inequalities: $f(c) > f(0) > f(1)$.\n    *   Substituting the known values, this becomes $1 > c > f(1)$.\n    *   We again find $f(1) = f(f(c)) = e^c$.\n    *   The inequality becomes $1 > c > e^c$. The inequality $1>c$ is true for $c<0$. However, the inequality $c > e^c$ is false. For any negative number $c$, $c$ is negative while $e^c$ is positive, so $c < e^c$. This leads to a contradiction.\n\nSince both subcases lead to a contradiction, our initial assumption must be false. There are **no** strictly decreasing continuous functions $f$ that satisfy the given equation.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the case where `f` is strictly increasing\n\nWe are now looking for the number of strictly increasing continuous functions $f$ such that $f(f(x)) = e^x$.\n\n1.  **Properties of increasing solutions:**\n    *   If there was an $x_0$ such that $f(x_0) \\le x_0$, then since $f$ is increasing, $f(f(x_0)) \\le f(x_0) \\le x_0$. This would mean $e^{x_0} \\le x_0$, which is impossible. Therefore, for any solution $f$, we must have $f(x) > x$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n    *   From $f(x)>x$, we can apply $f$ to get $f(f(x)) > f(x)$, which means $e^x > f(x)$.\n    *   So, any solution must be bounded by $x < f(x) < e^x$.\n\n2.  **Existence and Construction of Solutions:**\n    *   The existence of such functions, which are \"fractional iterates\" (a \"half-iterate\" in this case), is a known result in the theory of functional equations.\n    *   We can construct these solutions. A solution is uniquely determined by its behavior on a certain interval.\n    *   Let $f$ be such a solution. As proved in Step 2, $f$ must be strictly increasing. Let's analyze its range. From $x < f(x) < e^x$, as $x \\to -\\infty$, $f(x)$ must approach a finite limit $a$, where $-\\infty \\le a \\le 0$. Since $f(x)>x$, $a$ must be finite. Let $\\lim_{x\\to-\\infty} f(x) = a$.\n    *   From $f(f(x))=e^x$, taking the limit as $x \\to -\\infty$: $\\lim_{x\\to-\\infty}f(f(x)) = \\lim_{y\\to a^+} f(y) = \\lim_{x\\to-\\infty} e^x = 0$.\n    *   Since $f$ is continuous, this implies $f(a)=0$.\n    *   From $f(a)=0$ and $f$ being strictly increasing, we have $a < 0$.\n    *   Applying the equation at $x=a$: $f(f(a)) = f(0) = e^a$.\n    *   The construction of a solution can be based on defining $f$ over the interval $[a, 0]$. On this interval, $f$ must be a strictly increasing continuous function mapping $[a, 0]$ to $[f(a), f(0)] = [0, e^a]$. Let's call this function $\\phi$.\n    *   So, we choose an arbitrary $a < 0$. Then we choose an arbitrary strictly increasing continuous bijection $\\phi: [a, 0] \\to [0, e^a]$.\n    *   This choice of $\\phi$ on $[a,0]$ uniquely determines the function $f$ over all of $\\mathbb{R}$ through the relation $f(f(x))=e^x$ and the requirement of continuity and monotonicity.\n\n3.  **Counting the Solutions (Cardinality):**\n    *   The number of solutions is the number of possible valid choices we can make during the construction.\n    *   **Choice of `a`**: We can choose any $a \\in (-\\infty, 0)$. There is a continuum of choices for $a$. The cardinality of this set is $|\\mathbb{R}| = \\mathfrak{c}$.\n    *   **Choice of `Ï†`**: For any fixed $a$, we need to choose a strictly increasing continuous bijection (a homeomorphism) $\\phi: [a, 0] \\to [0, e^a]$. There is a continuum of such functions. For example, we can define a family of such functions by picking a point $(a/2, y)$ where $y \\in (0, e^a)$ and connecting $(a,0)$, $(a/2, y)$, and $(0, e^a)$ with line segments. The choice of $y$ is from an open interval, so there are $\\mathfrak{c}$ choices.\n    *   The total number of ways to construct a solution is the product of the number of choices at each step. So, there are at least $\\mathfrak{c} \\times \\mathfrak{c} = \\mathfrak{c}$ such functions.\n    *   The set of all solutions is a subset of the set of all continuous functions from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$, which is denoted $C(\\mathbb{R})$. The cardinality of $C(\\mathbb{R})$ is known to be $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n    *   Therefore, the number of solutions must be less than or equal to $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n\nSince the number of solutions is both at least $\\mathfrak{c}$ and at most $\\mathfrak{c}$, it must be exactly $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\n*   The number of strictly decreasing continuous solutions is 0.\n*   The number of strictly increasing continuous solutions is $\\mathfrak{c}$, the cardinality of the continuum.\n*   The total number of solutions is $0 + \\mathfrak{c} = \\mathfrak{c}$.\n\nThe cardinality of the set is the cardinality of the continuum ($|\\mathbb{R}| = 2^{\\aleph_0}$), often denoted as $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n\n<<<C>>>"
