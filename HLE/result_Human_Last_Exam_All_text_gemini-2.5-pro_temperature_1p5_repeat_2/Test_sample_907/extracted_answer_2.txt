The equations for the absorption cross-section $\sigma(\omega_L)$ as a function of the laser's central frequency $\omega_L$ are as follows.

Let $\omega_0$ be the exciton transition frequency of a single isolated molecule, $\vec{\mu}_{mol}$ be its transition dipole moment, $N$ be the number of molecules in the chain, $\tau$ be the duration of the Gaussian laser pulse, and $J$ be the near-neighbor interaction energy. The constant $K = \frac{\sqrt{2\pi}\tau}{\hbar c \epsilon_0}$ groups together physical constants (assuming light polarization is aligned with the molecular dipoles).

**a) The interaction between molecules can be neglected.**

In this case, the total absorption is the incoherent sum of the absorptions of N independent molecules. All molecules have the same transition frequency $\omega_0$.

$\sigma_a(\omega_L) = N \left( K \omega_0 |\vec{\mu}_{mol}|^2 \right) e^{-(\omega_0 - \omega_L)^2 \tau^2 / 2}$

The absorption spectrum is a Gaussian peak centered at the single-molecule transition frequency $\omega_0$. The peak's amplitude is proportional to the number of molecules, $N$.

**b) The interaction between near-neighbors should be considered.**

In this case, the exciton states are delocalized over the chain due to the interaction $J$. According to the Frenkel exciton model for a linear chain, the optical selection rules dictate that only the exciton state with wavevector $k=0$ is optically active from the ground state.

The energy of this $k=0$ exciton is shifted by the interaction: $E_{k=0} = \hbar\omega_0 + 2J$.
The transition dipole moment to this state is a coherent sum of individual molecular dipoles: $|\vec{\mu}_{g,k=0}|^2 = N |\vec{\mu}_{mol}|^2$.

The absorption cross-section is therefore given by a single term corresponding to this allowed transition:

$\sigma_b(\omega_L) = K \left( (\omega_0 + \frac{2J}{\hbar}) (N|\vec{\mu}_{mol}|^2) \right) e^{-(\omega_0 + \frac{2J}{\hbar} - \omega_L)^2 \tau^2 / 2}$

The absorption spectrum is still a single Gaussian peak. However, its position is shifted to $\omega_0 + 2J/\hbar$. The sign of $J$ determines if the shift is to higher (blue shift, H-aggregates) or lower (red shift, J-aggregates) energy. The entire oscillator strength of the chain is concentrated into this single transition.
