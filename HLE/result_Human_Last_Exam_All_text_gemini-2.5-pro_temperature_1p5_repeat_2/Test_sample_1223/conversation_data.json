    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Deconstruction of the Terminology**\n\n*   **Metric Continuum:** A non-empty, compact, connected metric space.\n*   **Indecomposable Continuum:** A continuum that cannot be expressed as the union of two of its proper subcontinua.\n*   **Hereditarily Indecomposable Continuum (HIC):** A continuum where every subcontinuum is indecomposable. The pseudo-arc is a key example. An HIC is, by definition, an indecomposable continuum.\n*   **$X \\setminus \\{x\\}$:** This is the space $X$ with a single point removed. Since $X$ is a compact Hausdorff space and $\\{x\\}$ is a closed set, $X \\setminus \\{x\\}$ is a locally compact, non-compact Hausdorff space. As it's a subspace of a metric space, it is also a Tychonoff space.\n*   **Stone-Cech Compactification $\\beta(Y)$:** For a Tychonoff space $Y$, $\\beta(Y)$ is the unique (up to homeomorphism) compact Hausdorff space that contains $Y$ as a dense subspace and has the property that any continuous map from $Y$ to any other compact Hausdorff space $K$ extends uniquely to a continuous map from $\\beta(Y)$ to $K$.\n*   **Stone-Cech Remainder:** The remainder is the set of points added to compactify the space, i.e., $\\beta(Y) \\setminus Y$. In our case, this is $R = \\beta(X \\setminus \\{x\\}) \\setminus (X \\setminus \\{x\\})$.\n*   **Composant of an indecomposable continuum:** For a point $p$ in an indecomposable continuum $K$, the composant containing $p$ is the set of all points $q$ such that there exists a proper subcontinuum of $K$ containing both $p$ and $q$. The composants partition the continuum.\n\n**2. Determining the Topological Properties of the Remainder**\n\nThe core of the problem is to determine the structure of the Stone-Cech remainder $R$. We need to know if it has composants, which first requires it to be an indecomposable continuum.\n\n*   **Is R a continuum?**\n    *   A continuum is compact and connected.\n    *   The remainder $R$ is a closed subset of the compact space $\\beta(X \\setminus \\{x\\})$, so $R$ is compact.\n    *   Since $X \\setminus \\{x\\}$ is a non-compact, locally compact metric space, its remainder $R$ is non-empty.\n    *   A key theorem by J. van Mill and M. van de Vel (1979) states that for any continuum $X$ and any point $x \\in X$, the Stone-Cech remainder of $X \\setminus \\{x\\}$ is connected.\n    *   Therefore, $R$ is a non-empty, compact, and connected space, which means it is a continuum.\n\n*   **Is R indecomposable?**\n    *   The question states that $X$ is a hereditary indecomposable continuum, which implies $X$ is an indecomposable continuum.\n    *   A fundamental theorem by D. P. Bellamy (1973) states that if $M$ is an indecomposable continuum and $p \\in M$, then the remainder $\\beta(M \\setminus \\{p\\}) \\setminus (M \\setminus \\{p\\})$ is an indecomposable continuum.\n    *   Applying this theorem to our space $X$ and point $x$, we conclude that the remainder $R$ is an indecomposable continuum.\n\n*   **Is R non-degenerate?**\n    *   A degenerate continuum is a single point. A non-degenerate continuum has more than one point.\n    *   The remainder $R = \\beta(Y) \\setminus Y$ consists of a single point if and only if the space $Y$ is pseudocompact.\n    *   A space is pseudocompact if every continuous real-valued function on it is bounded. For metric spaces, pseudocompactness is equivalent to compactness.\n    *   Our space is $Y = X \\setminus \\{x\\}$. Since $X$ is a continuum, it is not a single point, so removing a point leaves a non-empty space. $Y$ is a proper open subset of the compact space $X$, so it cannot be compact.\n    *   Since $Y$ is a non-compact metric space, it is not pseudocompact.\n    *   Therefore, the remainder $R$ contains more than one point and is a non-degenerate indecomposable continuum.\n\n**3. Counting the Composants of the Remainder**\n\n*   We have established that the remainder $R$ is a non-degenerate indecomposable continuum.\n*   A classical theorem in continuum theory, originally due to S. Mazurkiewicz, states that every non-degenerate indecomposable continuum is partitioned by its composants.\n*   Furthermore, the number of distinct composants in any non-degenerate indecomposable continuum is always the same: it is the cardinality of the continuum, denoted by $c$ or $2^{\\aleph_0}$.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis shows that for any hereditary indecomposable continuum $X$ and any point $x \\in X$, the Stone-Cech remainder of $X \\setminus \\{x\\}$ is a non-degenerate indecomposable continuum. The number of composants of such a space is invariably $2^{\\aleph_0}$.\n\nSince this number is constant for all possible choices of $X$ and $x$ that fit the description, the maximum possible number is this constant value.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n1.  The property being counted (composants) belongs to the **remainder**, not the original space $X$.\n2.  The fact that $X$ is **hereditarily** indecomposable is a stronger condition than what is needed for the key theorems (which only require indecomposability), but it ensures we are working with a valid example and removes any ambiguity about the nature of $X$.\n3.  It is crucial to invoke the correct theorems about the structure of Stone-Cech remainders (Bellamy's theorem on indecomposability, van Mill/van de Vel's theorem on connectedness).\n4.  One must verify that the resulting indecomposable continuum (the remainder) is non-degenerate, as a degenerate continuum (a single point) has only one composant (itself). This verification relies on the fact that $X \\setminus \\{x\\}$ is not pseudocompact.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\n1.  Let $R$ be the Stone-Cech remainder of $X \\setminus \\{x\\}$.\n2.  From established theorems, because $X$ is an indecomposable continuum, $R$ is an indecomposable continuum.\n3.  Because $X \\setminus \\{x\\}$ is a non-compact metric space, $R$ is non-degenerate (i.e., not a single point).\n4.  Every non-degenerate indecomposable continuum has $2^{\\aleph_0}$ composants.\n5.  This result holds for any $X$ and $x$ satisfying the premises. Thus, the number of composants is always $2^{\\aleph_0}$.\n6.  The maximum possible number is therefore $2^{\\aleph_0}$."
