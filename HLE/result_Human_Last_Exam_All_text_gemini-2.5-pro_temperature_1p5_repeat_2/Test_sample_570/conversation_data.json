    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the minimal area of a convex domain that intersects all lines with the equation `px + qy = 1`, where `p` and `q` are coprime integers.\n\n**Step 1: Formalize the condition**\nLet `K` be a convex domain in the plane. Let `S` be the set of all pairs of coprime integers, i.e., `S = {(p, q) ∈ Z² | gcd(p, q) = 1}`.\nThe condition is that for every line `l_{p,q}` defined by the equation `px + qy = 1` with `(p, q) ∈ S`, the intersection `K ∩ l_{p,q}` is not empty.\n\nThis means that `K` cannot lie entirely on one side of any line `l_{p,q}`. Mathematically, for any `(p, q) ∈ S`, we must have:\n`inf_{(x,y)∈K} (px + qy) ≤ 1 ≤ sup_{(x,y)∈K} (px + qy)`\n\n**Step 2: Simplify by assuming symmetry**\nLet `K` be such a convex domain. Consider its central symmetrization, `K_c = (K - K) / 2 = { (a-b)/2 | a, b ∈ K }`.\n`K_c` is a centrally symmetric convex set with respect to the origin. It is a known result that `Area(K_c) ≤ Area(K)`.\nIf `K` satisfies the intersection property, `K_c` does as well. Thus, to find the minimal area, we can restrict our search to centrally symmetric convex sets centered at the origin.\n\nFor a centrally symmetric set `K`, `inf_{x∈K} (n·x) = -sup_{x∈K} (n·x)`. Let `h_K(n) = sup_{x∈K} (n·x)` be the support function of `K`. The condition simplifies to:\n`-h_K(p, q) ≤ 1 ≤ h_K(p, q)` for all `(p, q) ∈ S`.\nThis is equivalent to `h_K(p, q) ≥ 1` for all `(p, q) ∈ S`.\n\n**Step 3: Use the concept of polar duality**\nFor a centrally symmetric convex body `K` containing the origin, its polar body `K*` is defined as:\n`K* = { y ∈ R² | x·y ≤ 1 for all x ∈ K }`\nThe support function of `K` is related to `K*` by the property: `h_K(u) ≤ 1` if and only if `u ∈ K*`.\n\nThe condition on `K` is `h_K(u) ≥ 1` for all `u ∈ S`.\nThis implies that no vector `u` from the set `S` can be in the interior of `K*`. If a vector `u ∈ S` were in `int(K*)`, then there would exist some `ε > 0` such that `(1+ε)u ∈ K*`. This would mean `h_K((1+ε)u) ≤ 1`, which implies `(1+ε)h_K(u) ≤ 1`, leading to `h_K(u) < 1`. This contradicts our condition.\nSo, the condition on `K` is equivalent to the following condition on its polar `K*`:\n`int(K*) ∩ S = ∅`\nThe interior of `K*` must not contain any primitive integer lattice points.\n\n**Step 4: Maximize the area of the polar body `K*`**\nTo minimize `Area(K)`, we should maximize `Area(K*)`. This relationship is given by the Mahler volume `V(K) = Area(K)Area(K*)`. For centrally symmetric convex bodies in the plane, it is known (Mahler's theorem for n=2) that `Area(K)Area(K*) ≥ 8`. The minimum value of 8 is achieved when `K` (and `K*`) is a parallelogram.\n`Area(K) ≥ 8 / Area(K*)`.\nTo minimize `Area(K)`, we need to find the maximum possible area of `K*` subject to `int(K*) ∩ S = ∅`.\n\n**Step 5: Apply Minkowski's Convex Body Theorem**\nMinkowski's first fundamental theorem states that for a centrally symmetric convex body `C` in `R²`, if `Area(C) > 4`, then `C` must contain a non-zero integer lattice point in its interior.\nIf `z = (p,q)` is a non-zero integer point in `int(C)`, then the point `z' = z/gcd(p,q)` is a primitive integer point (i.e., `z' ∈ S`). Since `C` is convex and `z ∈ int(C)`, the point `z'` must also lie in `int(C)`.\nTherefore, if `Area(K*) > 4`, then `int(K*)` must contain a primitive integer point, which violates our condition `int(K*) ∩ S = ∅`.\nThis implies that the area of `K*` must be at most 4: `Area(K*) ≤ 4`.\n\n**Step 6: Determine the minimum area of `K`**\nCombining the results from Step 4 and Step 5:\n`Area(K) ≥ 8 / Area(K*)` and `Area(K*) ≤ 4`.\nThis gives a lower bound for the area of `K`:\n`Area(K) ≥ 8 / 4 = 2`.\n\n**Step 7: Verify that the minimum area can be achieved**\nWe need to show that there exists a convex set `K` that satisfies the conditions and has an area of 2.\nLet's choose a `K*` that has the maximum possible area of 4, for example, the square `K* = [-1, 1] × [-1, 1]`.\n`Area(K*) = 4`. The interior `int(K*) = (-1, 1) × (-1, 1)` contains no non-zero integer points, so it satisfies `int(K*) ∩ S = ∅`. This is a valid choice for `K*`.\n\nNow we find the corresponding set `K`, which is the polar of `K*`: `K = (K*)*`.\n`K = { (x, y) | u·x ≤ 1 for all u ∈ K* }`\n`K = { (x, y) | u₁x + u₂y ≤ 1 for all u₁ ∈ [-1, 1], u₂ ∈ [-1, 1] }`\nThe maximum value of `u₁x + u₂y` for `u` in the square `[-1, 1]²` is `|x| + |y|`.\nSo, `K` is the set defined by the inequality `|x| + |y| ≤ 1`.\nThis shape is a square with vertices at `(1,0), (0,1), (-1,0), (0,-1)`. It is a parallelogram.\nThe area of this set `K` is `1/2 * (diagonal₁) * (diagonal₂) = 1/2 * 2 * 2 = 2`.\n\nWe have found a set `K` with area 2, and we have proved that the minimal area must be at least 2. Therefore, the minimal area is exactly 2.\nThe product of the areas is `Area(K)Area(K*) = 2 × 4 = 8`, which matches the lower bound from Mahler's theorem for parallelograms."
