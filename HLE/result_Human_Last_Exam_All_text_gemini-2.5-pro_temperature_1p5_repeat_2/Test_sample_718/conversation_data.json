    "An analysis of the question is as follows.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Mathematical Objects:**\n    *   **$J$ is an upper semilattice:** A poset $(J, \\leq)$ is an upper semilattice if for any two elements $i, j \\in J$, their least upper bound (or join), denoted $i \\vee j$, exists in $J$. We can view this poset as a category where objects are the elements of $J$, and there is a unique morphism from $i$ to $j$ if and only if $i \\leq j$.\n    *   **$\\text{Vect}_K$:** This is the category of vector spaces over a field $K$. It is an abelian category.\n    *   **A functor $f: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K$:** This is also known as a representation of the poset $J$, or a $J$-module. It assigns a vector space $f(i)$ to each element $i \\in J$ and a linear map $f(i \\to j): f(i) \\to f(j)$ to each relation $i \\leq j$, such that composition is respected. The category of all such functors is denoted $\\text{Fun}(J, \\text{Vect}_K)$.\n    *   **A tame functor:** In the context of representation theory of posets, a poset is of \"tame representation type\" if its indecomposable representations can be classified and fall into a finite number of discrete representations and a finite number of one-parameter families for each dimension. For posets that are upper semilattices (or more generally, rooted trees), the representation type is known to be \"finite\" (a stronger condition than tame), meaning there are only a finite number of indecomposable representations up to isomorphism. The term \"tame functor\" here is likely used to signify any functor from this well-behaved class. However, as we will see, this condition is not essential for the homological property in question.\n    *   **$n$-resolvable:** A functor (or module) $f$ is said to be $n$-resolvable if it has a projective resolution of length $n$. This means there exists an exact sequence:\n        $0 \\to P_n \\to P_{n-1} \\to \\dots \\to P_1 \\to P_0 \\to f \\to 0$\n        where each $P_k$ is a projective functor in the category $\\text{Fun}(J, \\text{Vect}_K)$. The question asks for the smallest integer $n$ that works for *any* such functor $f$ on *any* upper semilattice $J$.\n\n2.  **Rephrasing the Question in Homological Algebra Terms:**\n    The question \"For what $n$ is every functor $f: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K$ $n$-resolvable?\" is equivalent to asking for the **global dimension** of the functor category $\\text{Fun}(J, \\text{Vect}_K)$. The global dimension of a category is the supremum of the projective dimensions of all its objects.\n\n3.  **Connecting Functor Categories to Module Categories:**\n    The category of functors $\\text{Fun}(J, \\text{Vect}_K)$ is equivalent to the category of left modules over the **path algebra** $KJ$. The global dimension of the functor category is therefore equal to the global dimension of the algebra $KJ$.\n\n4.  **Using Duality:**\n    The global dimension of an algebra can be computed using either left or right modules; the result is the same. The category of right $KJ$-modules is equivalent to the category of left modules over the opposite algebra $(KJ)^{op}$. This, in turn, is equivalent to the category of functors from the opposite category $J^{op}$ to $\\text{Vect}_K$, i.e., $\\text{Fun}(J^{op}, \\text{Vect}_K)$.\n    So, we have:\n    $\\text{gldim}(\\text{Fun}(J, \\text{Vect}_K)) = \\text{gldim}(KJ) = \\text{gldim}((KJ)^{op}) = \\text{gldim}(\\text{Fun}(J^{op}, \\text{Vect}_K))$.\n\n5.  **Analyzing the Structure of the Opposite Poset $J^{op}$:**\n    If $(J, \\leq)$ is an upper semilattice, it means for any $i,j \\in J$, the join $i \\vee j = \\sup\\{i, j\\}$ exists. The opposite poset $J^{op}$ is defined by reversing the order relation: $i \\leq_{op} j$ in $J^{op}$ if and only if $j \\leq i$ in $J$.\n    The greatest lower bound (meet) of $i$ and $j$ in $J^{op}$ is an element $m$ such that $m \\leq_{op} i$ and $m \\leq_{op} j$, and for any other $m'$, if $m' \\leq_{op} i$ and $m' \\leq_{op} j$, then $m' \\leq_{op} m$. Translating back to the order in $J$, this means $i \\leq m$, $j \\leq m$, and for any $m'$, if $i \\leq m'$ and $j \\leq m'$, then $m \\leq m'$. This is precisely the definition of the least upper bound (join) of $i$ and $j$ in $J$.\n    Therefore, if $J$ is an upper semilattice, its opposite poset $J^{op}$ is a **lower semilattice**.\n\n6.  **Applying a Key Theorem from Homological Algebra:**\n    There is a fundamental result in the representation theory of posets that relates the structure of a poset $P$ to the global dimension of its category of representations $\\text{Fun}(P, \\text{Vect}_K)$.\n    **Theorem:** The global dimension of $\\text{Fun}(P, \\text{Vect}_K)$ is at most 1 if and only if for any pair of elements $i, j \\in P$, the sub-poset $\\{k \\in P \\mid k \\leq i \\text{ and } k \\leq j\\}$ is either empty or has a unique maximal element.\n    A lower semilattice satisfies this condition. For any $i, j$ in a lower semilattice, their meet $i \\wedge j$ is the unique maximal element of the set of their common lower bounds.\n\n7.  **Synthesizing the Result:**\n    *   We want to find the global dimension of $\\text{Fun}(J, \\text{Vect}_K)$.\n    *   This is equal to the global dimension of $\\text{Fun}(J^{op}, \\text{Vect}_K)$.\n    *   Since $J$ is an upper semilattice, $J^{op}$ is a lower semilattice.\n    *   By the theorem, the global dimension of $\\text{Fun}(J^{op}, \\text{Vect}_K)$ is at most 1.\n    *   Therefore, the global dimension of $\\text{Fun}(J, \\text{Vect}_K)$ is at most 1.\n    *   This means that any functor $f: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K$ has a projective resolution of length at most 1. That is, there is an exact sequence $0 \\to P_1 \\to P_0 \\to f \\to 0$. This is a 1-resolution.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **The \"tame functor\" condition is a red herring.** The property of being $n$-resolvable for small $n$ is a property of the entire category $\\text{Fun}(J, \\text{Vect}_K)$, determined by the structure of $J$. Since the global dimension of the category is $\\leq 1$, *every* functor, tame or not, is 1-resolvable. The fact that upper semilattices give rise to tame (or even finite) representation types is a stronger, related fact, but not necessary for this specific conclusion.\n*   **Upper vs. Lower Semilattice:** The key theorem is typically stated for posets whose common \"predecessors\" are well-behaved (forming a lower semilattice structure). Our starting point is an upper semilattice, so the duality argument (switching to $J^{op}$) is crucial.\n*   **The value of n:** The global dimension is *at most* 1. It is 0 if and only if the poset $J$ has no relations other than identity (i.e., it's an antichain), which is a trivial case of an upper semilattice. For any non-trivial upper semilattice (e.g., one with a relation $i < j$), there will be non-projective functors, and the global dimension will be exactly 1. Since the question asks for a single $n$ that works for *any* upper semilattice $J$, we must choose the maximum possible value, which is 1.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nAny functor $f: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K$ where $J$ is an upper semilattice has a projective resolution of length at most 1. Therefore, it is 1-resolvable.\n\n<<<1>>>"
