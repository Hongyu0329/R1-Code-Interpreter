    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, including careful points to consider.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the System and Quantum Numbers**\n\nThe problem asks about a **p-electron**. This single phrase provides the two essential quantum numbers for this problem:\n*   **\"p\"** refers to the orbital angular momentum. For a p-orbital, the orbital angular momentum quantum number is **l = 1**.\n*   **\"electron\"** refers to the intrinsic spin of the particle. An electron is a fermion with a spin quantum number of **s = 1/2**.\n\n**Step 2: Define the Total Angular Momentum**\n\nIn a system with spin-orbit coupling, the orbital angular momentum **L** and spin angular momentum **S** are no longer individually conserved. Instead, they couple to form a total angular momentum **J**, which is defined as:\n**J = L + S**\n\nThe operators for the squared magnitude of the total angular momentum, $J^2$, and its projection onto the z-axis, $J_z$, commute with each other ($[J^2, J_z] = 0$). This is a fundamental property of angular momentum operators, which means they share a common set of eigenstates. We can therefore simultaneously determine their eigenvalues.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Possible Values of the Total Angular Momentum Quantum Number (j)**\n\nAccording to the rules of angular momentum addition in quantum mechanics, the total angular momentum quantum number, *j*, can take values from $|l - s|$ to $l + s$ in integer steps.\n*   Given $l=1$ and $s=1/2$:\n*   Minimum value of *j*: $j_{min} = |l - s| = |1 - 1/2| = 1/2$\n*   Maximum value of *j*: $j_{max} = l + s = 1 + 1/2 = 3/2$\n\nThus, the possible values for the total angular momentum quantum number are **j = 1/2** and **j = 3/2**.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate Eigenvalues for Each Possible 'j' Value**\n\nWe now analyze each possible value of *j* separately to find the common eigenvalues of $J^2$ and $J_z$.\nThe eigenvalues are given by:\n*   For $J^2$: $\\hbar^2 j(j+1)$\n*   For $J_z$: $\\hbar m_j$, where $m_j$ can take values from $-j$ to $+j$ in integer steps (i.e., $m_j = -j, -j+1, ..., j-1, j$).\n\n**Case 1: j = 3/2**\n\n*   **Eigenvalue of J²:**\n    *   The eigenvalue is $\\hbar^2 j(j+1) = \\hbar^2 \\frac{3}{2}(\\frac{3}{2} + 1) = \\hbar^2 \\frac{3}{2}(\\frac{5}{2}) = \\frac{15}{4}\\hbar^2$.\n*   **Eigenvalues of Jz:**\n    *   The possible values for the magnetic quantum number $m_j$ are: $m_j = -3/2, -1/2, +1/2, +3/2$.\n    *   The corresponding eigenvalues of $J_z$ are: $-\\frac{3}{2}\\hbar, -\\frac{1}{2}\\hbar, \\frac{1}{2}\\hbar, \\frac{3}{2}\\hbar$.\n\nThis gives us a set of four states, all with the same $J^2$ eigenvalue but different $J_z$ eigenvalues.\n\n**Case 2: j = 1/2**\n\n*   **Eigenvalue of J²:**\n    *   The eigenvalue is $\\hbar^2 j(j+1) = \\hbar^2 \\frac{1}{2}(\\frac{1}{2} + 1) = \\hbar^2 \\frac{1}{2}(\\frac{3}{2}) = \\frac{3}{4}\\hbar^2$.\n*   **Eigenvalues of Jz:**\n    *   The possible values for the magnetic quantum number $m_j$ are: $m_j = -1/2, +1/2$.\n    *   The corresponding eigenvalues of $J_z$ are: $-\\frac{1}{2}\\hbar, \\frac{1}{2}\\hbar$.\n\nThis gives us a set of two states, both with the same $J^2$ eigenvalue but different $J_z$ eigenvalues.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n1.  **Correctly interpreting \"p-electron\":** This is the key to the entire problem. It immediately gives you $l=1$ and $s=1/2$.\n2.  **Commuting Operators:** The entire problem relies on the fact that $J^2$ and $J_z$ commute, which guarantees the existence of common eigenvalues.\n3.  **Eigenvalue Formulas:** Remember the standard formulas for angular momentum eigenvalues are $\\hbar^2 j(j+1)$ for the squared operator and $\\hbar m_j$ for the z-component operator. Don't forget the $\\hbar$ factors.\n4.  **Range of 'j' and 'm_j':** Be careful when calculating the allowed values for the quantum numbers $j$ and $m_j$. A mistake here will lead to incorrect results.\n5.  **Conservation of States (Sanity Check):** The total number of states must be conserved when changing from the uncoupled basis ($|l, m_l; s, m_s\\rangle$) to the coupled basis ($|j, m_j\\rangle$).\n    *   Uncoupled states: $(2l+1)(2s+1) = (2(1)+1)(2(1/2)+1) = 3 \\times 2 = 6$ states.\n    *   Coupled states: For $j=3/2$, there are $(2j+1) = 2(3/2)+1 = 4$ states. For $j=1/2$, there are $(2j+1) = 2(1/2)+1 = 2$ states. Total = $4+2=6$ states. The number of states is conserved.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe common eigenvalues of $J^2$ and $J_z$ are grouped into two sets, corresponding to the two possible values of the total angular momentum quantum number *j*.\n\n<<<\nThe common eigenvalues are found by first identifying the possible total angular momentum quantum numbers, $j$, which are $j = 3/2$ and $j = 1/2$. The eigenvalues are then calculated for each case.\n\n**1. For the j = 3/2 multiplet:**\n*   The single eigenvalue of $J^2$ is $\\frac{15}{4}\\hbar^2$.\n*   The four corresponding eigenvalues of $J_z$ are $\\frac{3}{2}\\hbar$, $\\frac{1}{2}\\hbar$, $-\\frac{1}{2}\\hbar$, and $-\\frac{3}{2}\\hbar$.\n\n**2. For the j = 1/2 multiplet:**\n*   The single eigenvalue of $J^2$ is $\\frac{3}{4}\\hbar^2$.\n*   The two corresponding eigenvalues of $J_z$ are $\\frac{1}{2}\\hbar$ and $-\\frac{1}{2}\\hbar$.\n>>>"
