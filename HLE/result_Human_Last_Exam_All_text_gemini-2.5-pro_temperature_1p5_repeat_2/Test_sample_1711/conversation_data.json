    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Group G and its Subgroups\n\nThe group is given as $G = (\\mathbb{Z}/49\\mathbb{Z})^{2024}$.\n*   This is an abelian group, which is a direct product of 2024 copies of the cyclic group $\\mathbb{Z}_{49}$.\n*   The order of an element $g = (g_1, g_2, \\dots, g_{2024}) \\in G$ is the least common multiple of the orders of its components, $\\text{ord}(g) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(g_1), \\dots, \\text{ord}(g_{2024}))$.\n*   In $\\mathbb{Z}_{49}$, the order of an element can be 1, 7, or 49 (the divisors of 49).\n*   Therefore, any element in $G$ must have an order that is 1, 7, or 49.\n*   This means the cyclic subgroups of $G$ can only have order 1, 7, or 49.\n    *   **Order 1:** The trivial subgroup, $\\{0\\}$.\n    *   **Order 7:** Subgroups generated by elements of order 7.\n    *   **Order 49:** Subgroups generated by elements of order 49.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Condition\n\nWe are looking for the smallest size of a subset $A \\subset G$ such that \"every cyclic subgroup of $G$ contains at least one element of $A$\".\nLet $H$ be any cyclic subgroup of $G$. The condition is $A \\cap H \\neq \\emptyset$.\n\n**Careful Point 1: The Trivial Solution**\nA literal interpretation of the problem leads to a simple answer. Let's consider the set $A = \\{0\\}$, which has size 1. Every subgroup of $G$, including every cyclic subgroup, must contain the identity element, 0. Therefore, for any cyclic subgroup $H$, $0 \\in H$. This means $A \\cap H = \\{0\\} \\cap H = \\{0\\}$, which is non-empty. Thus, $A=\\{0\\}$ satisfies the condition. The smallest possible size of a non-empty set is 1, so the answer would be 1.\n\n**Careful Point 2: The Intended Meaning of the Question**\nThe problem gives a very specific and complex group, $G = (\\mathbb{Z}/49\\mathbb{Z})^{2024}$. If the answer were simply 1, this information would be entirely irrelevant. In mathematical problems, especially in algebra and combinatorics, it is highly improbable that such detailed information is extraneous. This suggests that the question is intended to be non-trivial. The standard convention in such problems is to implicitly exclude the trivial \"solution\" that relies on the identity element. The likely intended problem is to find a set $A$ that intersects every non-trivial cyclic subgroup with a non-zero element. Given that the question includes \"every cyclic subgroup,\" the most faithful interpretation that is also non-trivial is:\n*   For the trivial subgroup $\\{0\\}$, $A \\cap \\{0\\} \\neq \\emptyset$, which implies $0 \\in A$.\n*   For any non-trivial cyclic subgroup $H$ (i.e., $H \\neq \\{0\\}$), we must have $A \\cap (H \\setminus \\{0\\}) \\neq \\emptyset$. This means $A$ must contain a non-zero element from every non-trivial cyclic subgroup.\n\nWe will proceed with this more plausible interpretation.\n\n### Step 3: Reducing the Problem\n\nLet's work under the assumption that we need to find the smallest set $A$ such that $0 \\in A$, and for any non-trivial cyclic subgroup $H$, $A$ contains a non-zero element of $H$.\n\nLet $H_{49}$ be a cyclic subgroup of order 49, generated by an element $g$ of order 49. $H_{49} = \\langle g \\rangle$. This subgroup contains a unique cyclic subgroup of order 7, which is $K_7 = \\langle 7g \\rangle$.\nIf our set $A$ contains a non-zero element $a$ from every cyclic subgroup of order 7, then it will also satisfy the condition for every subgroup of order 49. Why?\nFor any $H_{49} = \\langle g \\rangle$, its corresponding subgroup $K_7 = \\langle 7g \\rangle$ is a cyclic subgroup of order 7. By our assumption on $A$, there exists a non-zero element $a \\in A$ such that $a \\in K_7$. Since $K_7 \\subset H_{49}$, this element $a$ is also in $H_{49}$. Thus, a set $A$ satisfying the condition for all order-7 subgroups (and containing 0) will satisfy it for all subgroups.\n\nSo, the problem is reduced to finding the minimum size of a set $A$ such that:\n1.  $0 \\in A$.\n2.  For every cyclic subgroup $K$ of order 7, $A \\cap (K \\setminus \\{0\\}) \\neq \\emptyset$.\n\nLet $A' = A \\setminus \\{0\\}$. The problem is to find the minimum size of $A'$, and the final answer will be $|A'| + 1$.\n\n### Step 4: Solving the Reduced Problem\n\nWe need to find the smallest set $A'$ that \"hits\" the non-zero elements of every cyclic subgroup of order 7.\n\nLet $\\mathcal{H}_7$ be the set of all cyclic subgroups of order 7.\nLet $K_1, K_2$ be two distinct subgroups in $\\mathcal{H}_7$. Since they are distinct subgroups of prime order 7, their intersection is the trivial subgroup: $K_1 \\cap K_2 = \\{0\\}$.\nThis means their sets of non-zero elements are disjoint: $(K_1 \\setminus \\{0\\}) \\cap (K_2 \\setminus \\{0\\}) = \\emptyset$.\n\nTo satisfy the condition, for each $K \\in \\mathcal{H}_7$, we must choose at least one element from $K \\setminus \\{0\\}$ to be in $A'$. Since these sets ($K \\setminus \\{0\\}$ for $K \\in \\mathcal{H}_7$) are all pairwise disjoint, we must choose a distinct element for each subgroup.\nTherefore, the minimum size of $A'$ must be equal to the number of cyclic subgroups of order 7.\n$|A'|_{min} = |\\mathcal{H}_7|$.\n\n### Step 5: Counting the Cyclic Subgroups of Order 7\n\nTo find the number of cyclic subgroups of order 7, we can count the number of elements of order 7 and divide by the number of generators in each such subgroup.\n\n1.  **Count elements $g$ with $7g=0$**: An element $g=(g_1, \\dots, g_{2024})$ satisfies $7g=0$ if and only if $7g_i \\equiv 0 \\pmod{49}$ for each component $i$. In $\\mathbb{Z}_{49}$, the solutions to $7x \\equiv 0$ are the multiples of 7: $\\{0, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42\\}$. There are 7 such values. Since there are 2024 components, the total number of elements $g$ with $7g=0$ is $7^{2024}$.\n\n2.  **Count elements of order 7**: The elements of order 7 are those where $7g=0$ but $g \\neq 0$. This is all the elements from the previous step, except for the zero element. So, there are $7^{2024}-1$ elements of order 7.\n\n3.  **Count the subgroups**: A cyclic group of order 7 has $\\phi(7) = 6$ generators (all its non-zero elements are generators). To find the number of distinct subgroups, we partition the set of order-7 elements by the subgroup they generate.\n    Number of cyclic subgroups of order 7 is:\n    $$|\\mathcal{H}_7| = \\frac{\\text{Number of elements of order 7}}{\\text{Number of generators per subgroup}} = \\frac{7^{2024}-1}{6}$$\n    (Note: $7 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{6}$, so $7^{2024} \\equiv 1^{2024} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{6}$, which ensures $7^{2024}-1$ is divisible by 6, so this is an integer).\n\n### Step 6: Final Answer\n\nThe minimum size of the set of non-zero elements $A'$ is $|\\mathcal{H}_7| = \\frac{7^{2024}-1}{6}$.\nThe total set $A$ must also contain 0 to hit the trivial subgroup $\\{0\\}$. So, the minimum size of $A$ is:\n$|A| = |A'| + 1 = \\frac{7^{2024}-1}{6} + 1$.\n\nThis can also be written as:\n$|A| = \\frac{7^{2024}-1+6}{6} = \\frac{7^{2024}+5}{6}$.\n\nFinal answer is the numerical value of this expression.\n\n$\\frac{7^{2024}-1}{6} + 1$"
