    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the formula for the fermionic partition function in the imaginary time path integral formalism.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Starting Point: The Definition of the Partition Function**\n    In quantum statistical mechanics, the canonical partition function (Z) is the trace of the statistical density operator, `e^(-βH)`:\n    `Z = Tr(e^(-βH))`\n    where:\n    *   `H` is the Hamiltonian of the system.\n    *   `β = 1/(k_B T)` is the inverse temperature (`k_B` is the Boltzmann constant, `T` is the temperature).\n    *   `Tr(...)` denotes the trace, which is a sum over a complete set of basis states of the system's Hilbert space. For fermions, these basis states must be properly antisymmetrized.\n\n2.  **Introducing Imaginary Time and Path Integrals**\n    Feynman's path integral formalism is a method to calculate quantum mechanical transition amplitudes. The key idea is to replace the time evolution operator `e^(-iHt/ħ)` with a sum (integral) over all possible paths. By making the substitution `t = -iτ` (where `τ` is \"imaginary time\"), the quantum operator becomes the statistical operator `e^(-Hτ/ħ)`. Setting `ħ=1` and letting `τ` run from `0` to `β`, the calculation of `Z` becomes equivalent to calculating the transition amplitude from a state back to itself over an imaginary time interval `β`.\n\n3.  **The Challenge of Fermions: Anticommutation**\n    Fermionic creation (`a†`) and annihilation (`a`) operators obey anticommutation relations (e.g., `{a_i, a_j†} = δ_ij`, `{a_i, a_j} = 0`). Standard numbers (c-numbers) commute. To represent these anticommuting operators in a path integral (which uses classical-like fields), we must introduce a new kind of number that also anticommutes. These are called **Grassmann numbers**.\n\n4.  **Careful Point 1: Grassmann Variables**\n    The fields in the fermionic path integral, usually denoted `ψ(τ)` and `ψ*(τ)`, are not regular complex-valued functions. They are **Grassmann-valued fields**. The defining property of Grassmann numbers (`η_1`, `η_2`, ...) is that they anticommute:\n    `η_1 η_2 = -η_2 η_1`\n    A direct consequence is that the square of any Grassmann number is zero: `η_1² = 0`. This mathematical property perfectly encodes the Pauli exclusion principle (no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state).\n\n5.  **Building the Path Integral Expression**\n    The process involves:\n    *   Expressing the trace `Tr` using fermionic coherent states, which are eigenstates of the annihilation operator.\n    *   Slicing the imaginary time interval `β` into `N` infinitesimal steps of size `ε = β/N`.\n    *   Inserting a complete set of coherent states between each time slice.\n    *   Taking the continuum limit as `N → ∞` and `ε → 0`.\n\n6.  **Careful Point 2: Anti-Periodic Boundary Conditions**\n    A crucial detail emerges from taking the trace with fermionic states. Unlike the bosonic case which leads to periodic boundary conditions, the fermionic trace enforces **anti-periodic boundary conditions** on the Grassmann fields over the imaginary time interval `β`.\n    *   `ψ(β) = -ψ(0)`\n    *   `ψ*(β) = -ψ*(0)`\n    This is a fundamental distinction and a direct consequence of Fermi-Dirac statistics. It gives rise to fermionic Matsubara frequencies `ω_n = (2n+1)π/β`, in contrast to the bosonic ones `ω_n = 2nπ/β`.\n\n7.  **The Final Formula: Action and Integration**\n    The final expression takes the form of a functional integral over the Grassmann fields, weighted by the exponential of a Euclidean action (`S_E`).\n    *   **The Functional Integral:** `∫ D[ψ*(τ), ψ(τ)]` represents the sum over all possible paths (histories) of the fermionic fields `ψ(τ)` and `ψ*(τ)` that satisfy the anti-periodic boundary conditions.\n    *   **The Euclidean Action (`S_E`):** The action is given by:\n        `S_E[ψ*, ψ] = ∫_0^β dτ [ ψ*(τ) ∂_τ ψ(τ) + H(ψ*(τ), ψ(τ)) ]`\n        *   The `∫_0^β dτ` is the integration over imaginary time.\n        *   The term `ψ*(τ) ∂_τ ψ(τ)` is the kinetic term in imaginary time.\n        *   `H(ψ*(τ), ψ(τ))` is the system's Hamiltonian, where the original creation and annihilation operators (`a†`, `a`) have been replaced by the corresponding Grassmann fields (`ψ*`, `ψ`).\n\n### Final Answer Formulation\n\nPutting all these pieces together, the formula for the fermionic partition function `Z` in the imaginary time path integral formalism is an integral over all anti-periodic Grassmann field configurations, weighted by the exponential of the negative Euclidean action.\n\n<<<The formula for the fermionic partition function Z in the imaginary time representation using Feynman’s path integral formalism is given by:\n$Z = \\int_{\\psi(\\beta) = -\\psi(0)} D[\\psi^*(\\tau), \\psi(\\tau)] e^{-S_E[\\psi^*, \\psi]}$\n\nWhere:\n*   $Z$ is the partition function.\n*   $\\int D[\\psi^*(\\tau), \\psi(\\tau)]$ is the functional integral over all possible paths of the Grassmann-valued fields $\\psi(\\tau)$ and its conjugate $\\psi^*(\\tau)$.\n*   The subscript $\\psi(\\beta) = -\\psi(0)$ explicitly denotes the crucial **anti-periodic boundary conditions** that the fields must satisfy over the imaginary time interval $[0, \\beta]$, where $\\beta=1/(k_B T)$.\n*   $S_E[\\psi^*, \\psi]$ is the Euclidean action for the fermionic system, defined as:\n    $S_E[\\psi^*, \\psi] = \\int_{0}^{\\beta} d\\tau \\left[ \\psi^*(\\tau) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\tau} \\psi(\\tau) + H(\\psi^*(\\tau), \\psi(\\tau)) \\right]$\n    Here, $H(\\psi^*(\\tau), \\psi(\\tau))$ is the Hamiltonian of the system with the fermion creation and annihilation operators replaced by the Grassmann fields $\\psi^*(\\tau)$ and $\\psi(\\tau)$, respectively.>>>"
