The formula for the fermionic partition function Z in the imaginary time representation using Feynmanâ€™s path integral formalism is given by:
$Z = \int_{\psi(\beta) = -\psi(0)} D[\psi^*(\tau), \psi(\tau)] e^{-S_E[\psi^*, \psi]}$

Where:
*   $Z$ is the partition function.
*   $\int D[\psi^*(\tau), \psi(\tau)]$ is the functional integral over all possible paths of the Grassmann-valued fields $\psi(\tau)$ and its conjugate $\psi^*(\tau)$.
*   The subscript $\psi(\beta) = -\psi(0)$ explicitly denotes the crucial **anti-periodic boundary conditions** that the fields must satisfy over the imaginary time interval $[0, \beta]$, where $\beta=1/(k_B T)$.
*   $S_E[\psi^*, \psi]$ is the Euclidean action for the fermionic system, defined as:
    $S_E[\psi^*, \psi] = \int_{0}^{\beta} d\tau \left[ \psi^*(\tau) \frac{\partial}{\partial \tau} \psi(\tau) + H(\psi^*(\tau), \psi(\tau)) \right]$
    Here, $H(\psi^*(\tau), \psi(\tau))$ is the Hamiltonian of the system with the fermion creation and annihilation operators replaced by the Grassmann fields $\psi^*(\tau)$ and $\psi(\tau)$, respectively.
