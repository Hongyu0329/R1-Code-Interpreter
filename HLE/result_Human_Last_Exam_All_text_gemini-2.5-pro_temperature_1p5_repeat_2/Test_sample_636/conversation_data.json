    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to calculate the state feedback gain matrix F.\n\n**Step 1: Define the System and the Goal**\nWe are given the state matrix A and the input matrix B:\n$A = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n$B = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThe goal is to find a state feedback gain matrix F such that the eigenvalues of the closed-loop system matrix, $A_{cl} = A + BF$, are at $-1 + j$ and $-1 - j$.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Desired Characteristic Polynomial**\nThe desired eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1 = -1 + j$ and $\\lambda_2 = -1 - j$. The characteristic polynomial corresponding to these eigenvalues is:\n$P_{desired}(\\lambda) = (\\lambda - \\lambda_1)(\\lambda - \\lambda_2)$\n$P_{desired}(\\lambda) = (\\lambda - (-1 + j))(\\lambda - (-1 - j))$\n$P_{desired}(\\lambda) = ((\\lambda + 1) - j)((\\lambda + 1) + j)$\n$P_{desired}(\\lambda) = (\\lambda + 1)^2 - j^2 = (\\lambda^2 + 2\\lambda + 1) - (-1)$\n$P_{desired}(\\lambda) = \\lambda^2 + 2\\lambda + 2$\n\n**Step 3: Formulate the Closed-Loop System Matrix**\nThe state feedback gain matrix F must have dimensions compatible for the multiplication `BF`. Since B is 2x2 and the state vector is 2x1, F must be a 2x2 matrix. Let's define F as:\n$F = \\begin{pmatrix} f_{11} & f_{12} \\\\ f_{21} & f_{22} \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nNow, we calculate the closed-loop matrix $A_{cl} = A + BF$:\n$A_{cl} = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} f_{11} & f_{12} \\\\ f_{21} & f_{22} \\end{pmatrix}$\n$A_{cl} = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} f_{11} + 2f_{21} & f_{12} + 2f_{22} \\\\ f_{11} & f_{12} \\end{pmatrix}$\n$A_{cl} = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 + f_{11} + 2f_{21} & 1 + f_{12} + 2f_{22} \\\\ 1 + f_{11} & f_{12} \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n**Step 4: Find the Characteristic Polynomial of the Closed-Loop System**\nThe characteristic polynomial of a 2x2 matrix $M = \\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{pmatrix}$ is given by $\\det(\\lambda I - M) = \\lambda^2 - \\text{tr}(M)\\lambda + \\det(M)$.\nWe must match the coefficients of this polynomial with our desired polynomial, $\\lambda^2 + 2\\lambda + 2$.\nBy comparing coefficients, we need:\n1.  $-\\text{tr}(A_{cl}) = 2 \\implies \\text{tr}(A_{cl}) = -2$\n2.  $\\det(A_{cl}) = 2$\n\nLet's compute the trace and determinant of $A_{cl}$:\n$\\text{tr}(A_{cl}) = (-1 + f_{11} + 2f_{21}) + f_{12} = f_{11} + f_{12} + 2f_{21} - 1$\n$\\det(A_{cl}) = (-1 + f_{11} + 2f_{21})f_{12} - (1 + f_{12} + 2f_{22})(1 + f_{11})$\n\nNow we set up the equations:\n1.  $f_{11} + f_{12} + 2f_{21} - 1 = -2 \\implies f_{11} + f_{12} + 2f_{21} = -1$\n2.  $(-1 + f_{11} + 2f_{21})f_{12} - (1 + f_{12} + 2f_{22})(1 + f_{11}) = 2$\n\n**Step 5: Solve for the Elements of F**\nWe have two equations and four unknowns ($f_{11}, f_{12}, f_{21}, f_{22}$). This means the system is underdetermined, and there are infinitely many solutions for F. This is a common feature of multi-input systems. We can find one specific solution by making a simplifying assumption.\n\nLet's assume we only use the first input, which corresponds to setting the second row of F to zero:\n$f_{21} = 0$ and $f_{22} = 0$.\n\nNow, substitute these values into our two equations:\n1.  $f_{11} + f_{12} + 2(0) = -1 \\implies f_{11} + f_{12} = -1$\n2.  $(-1 + f_{11} + 2(0))f_{12} - (1 + f_{12} + 2(0))(1 + f_{11}) = 2$\n    $(-1 + f_{11})f_{12} - (1 + f_{12})(1 + f_{11}) = 2$\n    $-f_{12} + f_{11}f_{12} - (1 + f_{11} + f_{12} + f_{11}f_{12}) = 2$\n    $-f_{12} + f_{11}f_{12} - 1 - f_{11} - f_{12} - f_{11}f_{12} = 2$\n    $-1 - f_{11} - 2f_{12} = 2 \\implies f_{11} + 2f_{12} = -3$\n\nNow we have a system of two linear equations with two unknowns:\n(I)  $f_{11} + f_{12} = -1$\n(II) $f_{11} + 2f_{12} = -3$\n\nSubtract equation (I) from equation (II):\n$(f_{11} + 2f_{12}) - (f_{11} + f_{12}) = -3 - (-1)$\n$f_{12} = -2$\n\nSubstitute $f_{12} = -2$ back into equation (I):\n$f_{11} + (-2) = -1$\n$f_{11} = 1$\n\nSo, one possible solution for the gain matrix F is:\n$F = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & -2 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n**Step 6: Verification (Optional but Recommended)**\nLet's check our result by calculating $A_{cl} = A+BF$ with our found F and finding its eigenvalues.\n$A_{cl} = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & -2 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n$A_{cl} = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & -2 \\\\ 1 & -2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n$A_{cl} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -1 \\\\ 2 & -2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThe characteristic equation is $\\det(\\lambda I - A_{cl}) = 0$:\n$\\det\\begin{pmatrix} \\lambda & 1 \\\\ -2 & \\lambda+2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\lambda(\\lambda+2) - (1)(-2) = \\lambda^2 + 2\\lambda + 2 = 0$\nThis matches our desired characteristic polynomial. The eigenvalues are found using the quadratic formula:\n$\\lambda = \\frac{-2 \\pm \\sqrt{2^2 - 4(1)(2)}}{2(1)} = \\frac{-2 \\pm \\sqrt{-4}}{2} = \\frac{-2 \\pm 2j}{2} = -1 \\pm j$\nThe verification confirms our solution is correct.\n\n<<<[[1, -2], [0, 0]]>>>"
