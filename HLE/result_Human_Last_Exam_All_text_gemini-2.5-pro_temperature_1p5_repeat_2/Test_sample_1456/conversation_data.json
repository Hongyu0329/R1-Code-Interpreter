    "This problem asks for the largest possible number of composants of the product of two nondegenerate continua. Let's break down the problem by defining the key terms and building the argument step-by-step.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Key Concepts\n\n*   **Continuum:** A continuum is a compact, connected metric space. A space is *nondegenerate* if it contains more than one point. Examples include a closed interval `[0, 1]`, a circle `S^1`, or a closed disk `D^2`.\n*   **Product of Continua:** If `X` and `Y` are continua, their Cartesian product `Z = X × Y` endowed with the product topology is also a continuum.\n*   **Composant:** For a point `p` in a continuum `X`, the composant of `p`, denoted `C(p)`, is the union of all proper subcontinua of `X` that contain `p`. A subcontinuum `S` is *proper* if `S ⊂ X` and `S ≠ X`. Being in the same composant is an equivalence relation, and the composants of `X` partition `X`.\n*   **Decomposable vs. Indecomposable Continua:**\n    *   A continuum `X` is **decomposable** if it can be written as the union of two of its proper subcontinua, i.e., `X = A ∪ B` where `A` and `B` are proper subcontinua of `X`.\n    *   A continuum `X` is **indecomposable** if it is not decomposable.\n\n### Step 2: Relating Composants to Decomposability\n\nThe number of composants a continuum has is directly related to whether it is decomposable or indecomposable.\n\n*   **Case 1: Decomposable Continua.**\n    A fundamental theorem in continuum theory states that a continuum is decomposable if and only if it has exactly **one** composant. In a decomposable continuum, for any two points `x` and `y`, there exists a proper subcontinuum containing both. Thus, all points belong to the same composant, which is the space itself. Simple continua like the interval `[0, 1]` or the disk `D^2` are decomposable and have only one composant.\n\n*   **Case 2: Indecomposable Continua.**\n    For indecomposable continua, the situation is drastically different. A famous theorem by Stefan Mazurkiewicz (1920) states that every indecomposable metric continuum has **`c`** (the cardinality of the continuum, `|ℝ| = 2^ℵ₀`) distinct composants. Furthermore, each composant is a dense `F_σ` subset of the space.\n\n### Step 3: Determining the Decomposability of the Product Space\n\nOur goal is to find the *largest possible* number of composants for the product space `Z = X × Y`. From Step 2, we see that to maximize this number, we need the product space `Z` to be indecomposable. This leads to the crucial question: under what conditions is the product of two continua indecomposable?\n\nThis question was answered by R. H. Bing in 1951. Bing's theorem states:\n> The product `X × Y` of two continua `X` and `Y` is indecomposable if and only if **both** `X` and `Y` are indecomposable.\n\n### Step 4: Constructing the Maximizing Case\n\nTo achieve the maximum number of composants for `Z = X × Y`, we must follow the implications of the theorems above.\n\n1.  To get more than one composant, the product space `Z = X × Y` must be indecomposable.\n2.  For `Z` to be indecomposable, both `X` and `Y` must be indecomposable continua.\n3.  The problem requires `X` and `Y` to be nondegenerate. Fortunately, any indecomposable continuum is necessarily nondegenerate.\n4.  We need to confirm that such continua exist. A classic example of a nondegenerate indecomposable continuum is the **Knaster continuum** (also known as the bucket-handle continuum).\n\nSo, we can choose `X` to be a Knaster continuum and `Y` to be a Knaster continuum. Both are nondegenerate continua and, by definition, indecomposable.\n\n### Step 5: Acquiring the Final Answer\n\n1.  Let `X` be a Knaster continuum. It is a nondegenerate indecomposable continuum.\n2.  Let `Y` be a Knaster continuum. It is also a nondegenerate indecomposable continuum.\n3.  Consider their product `Z = X × Y`.\n4.  According to Bing's theorem, since both `X` and `Y` are indecomposable, their product `Z` is also an indecomposable continuum.\n5.  According to Mazurkiewicz's theorem, since `Z` is an indecomposable continuum, it has exactly `c` (the cardinality of the continuum) composants.\n6.  Could the number of composants be larger than `c`? No. The total number of points in a continuum (which is a separable metric space) is at most `c`. The number of composants cannot exceed the number of points in the space.\n\nTherefore, by choosing two indecomposable continua for `X` and `Y`, we obtain a product space with `c` composants. If we choose at least one decomposable continuum, the product is decomposable and has only 1 composant. Thus, the largest possible number of composants is `c`.\n\nThe final answer is the cardinality of the continuum, denoted by `c`."
