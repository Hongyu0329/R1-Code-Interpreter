    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Location:** Piazza della Rotonda, Rome (in front of the Pantheon).\n    *   **Object:** A \"unique architectural feature\".\n    *   **Action:** It was \"removed\".\n    *   **Date:** Specifically \"until 1950\". This date is the most critical clue.\n\n2.  **Initial Brainstorming and Research:**\n    *   What features has the Piazza della Rotonda had over time?\n        *   The Pantheon itself. (Still there)\n        *   The fountain (Fontana del Pantheon) and obelisk. (Still there)\n        *   Buildings that were once attached to or stood in front of the Pantheon.\n        *   Two bell towers on the Pantheon, nicknamed the \"donkey's ears\".\n        *   Public transportation infrastructure.\n\n3.  **Evaluating Potential Candidates Based on the Date (1950):**\n\n    *   **Candidate 1: The \"Donkey's Ears\" Bell Towers.** These two bell towers, added by Gian Lorenzo Bernini in the 17th century, were a prominent feature. However, they were demolished in **1883**, so this does not match the 1950 date.\n\n    *   **Candidate 2: The block of medieval buildings (the \"spina\").** There was a cluster of old houses and shops that stood between the fountain and the Pantheon, largely obscuring the view. The process of demolishing these buildings to create the open square we see today occurred mostly in the late 19th century, particularly between **1870 and the early 1900s**. This also does not fit the 1950 timeframe.\n\n    *   **Candidate 3: The tramway line.** Historical photographs from the first half of the 20th century clearly show tram tracks running directly through the Piazza della Rotonda, passing between the fountain and the Pantheon. This network of tracks and overhead electrical lines was a very significant feature of the urban landscape.\n\n4.  **Focusing on the Tramway and the Year 1950:**\n    *   In the post-WWII era, Rome's city administration began a major overhaul of its public transport system. The decision was made to dismantle many tram lines in the crowded historic center.\n    *   This project was accelerated in preparation for the **1950 Holy Year (Jubilee)**, a major event that would bring millions of pilgrims and tourists to Rome. The city wanted to present a more modern and aesthetically pleasing face, and the noisy trams with their tracks and overhead wires were seen as detracting from the beauty of ancient sites like the Pantheon.\n    *   The tram line that passed through the Piazza della Rotonda was among those decommissioned and physically removed around this period. The service was replaced by more flexible bus lines.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   The specificity of the year **1950** is the key to solving the question and disqualifies other famous demolitions in the piazza's history.\n*   The term \"architectural feature\" must be interpreted broadly to include major urban infrastructure that defines the character and appearance of a space.\n*   The removal was part of a wider urban planning trend in Rome to \"modernize\" transportation and \"beautify\" the historic center by removing what was then considered cumbersome or unsightly infrastructure.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis, the unique feature that existed in the Piazza della Rotonda until its removal around 1950 was the public tramway line.\n\n<<<The tramway line>>>"
