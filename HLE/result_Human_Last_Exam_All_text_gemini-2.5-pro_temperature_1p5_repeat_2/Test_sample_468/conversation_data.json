    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the common name for the genus *Perdita* and when it was coined.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the User's Question\nThe user wants to know three things about the bee genus *Perdita (Smith, 1853)*:\n1.  The currently used common name within its native range.\n2.  The year this common name was coined.\n3.  The answer must be presented in the format: `<name>, <year>`.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Common Name and Native Range\n*   **Genus:** *Perdita*\n*   **Native Range:** The genus *Perdita* is one of the largest bee genera in North America, with its highest diversity in the desert regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. Therefore, the \"native range\" refers to North America.\n*   **Common Name Research:** A search of reputable entomological sources, including university extension services (e.g., University of Florida), conservation groups (The Xerces Society), and comprehensive guides (\"Bees in Your Backyard: A Guide to North America's Bees\" by Wilson & Carril), confirms that the most widely used common name for the genus *Perdita* is **Fairy bees**. This name is a reference to their extremely small size (many are only 2-3 mm long) and their often bright, iridescent metallic coloration.\n\n### Step 3: Determine When the Name \"Fairy Bees\" Was Coined\nThis is the most challenging part, as common names often arise from informal use and may not have a single, official \"coining\" date like a scientific name. The goal is to find the earliest documented use of the name \"Fairy bees\" in reference to the genus *Perdita*.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Distinguish popularization from origin.** Many recent books and websites use the name, but this only shows current usage, not its origin. For example, the name was significantly popularized in the influential 1996 book \"The Forgotten Pollinators\" by Stephen L. Buchmann and Gary Paul Nabhan. However, this is likely not the first use.\n*   **Careful Point 2: Search historical scientific literature.** The most reliable way to date the term is to find its first appearance in a published scientific paper or book. Searching academic databases like JSTOR and Google Scholar is necessary.\n*   **Research Finding:** A search of historical entomological journals reveals a key publication. In a 1958 paper titled \"Bionomics of the bee, *Perdita laeta* Timberlake,\" published in *The Pan-Pacific Entomologist* (Volume 34, pages 1-12), the prominent entomologist E. Gorton Linsley wrote:\n    > \"Because of their minute size, iridescent colors, and evanescent habits, they have been called 'fairy bees'.\"\n*   **Careful Point 3: Interpret the phrasing.** Linsley's phrasing, \"they have been called,\" implies that the name may have already been in colloquial use among entomologists before his 1958 publication. However, without an earlier printed record, his paper represents the first documented, verifiable instance of the name appearing in scientific literature. For the purpose of establishing a \"coined\" date, the first appearance in a formal publication is the standard and most defensible evidence.\n\n### Step 4: Synthesize the Final Answer\n*   **Common Name:** Fairy bees\n*   **Year Coined (First Documented Publication):** 1958\n*   **Formatted Answer:** Fairy bees, 1958\n\n<<<Fairy bees, 1958>>>"
