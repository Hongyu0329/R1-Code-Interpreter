    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the scaling exponent α.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal and the Theoretical Context**\nThe objective is to find the value of the specific heat scaling exponent, denoted by $\\alpha$, for a physical system with spatial dimension $d=3$. The method to be used is the epsilon ($\\epsilon$) expansion, a key technique in the Renormalization Group (RG) theory of critical phenomena. The specific heat $C$ of a system near its critical temperature $T_c$ is expected to scale as $C \\sim |(T-T_c)/T_c|^{-\\alpha}$.\n\n**Step 2: The Epsilon ($\\epsilon$) Expansion**\nThe epsilon expansion is a perturbative method used to calculate critical exponents in dimensions $d$ slightly below the *upper critical dimension* $d_c$. The upper critical dimension is the dimension at which mean-field theory exponents become exact. For a wide class of systems including the Ising, XY, and Heisenberg models (which fall under the O(n) model universality classes), the upper critical dimension is $d_c = 4$.\n\nThe expansion parameter is defined as:\n$\\epsilon = d_c - d$\n\nIn this problem, we are given $d=3$ and we know $d_c=4$. Therefore,\n$\\epsilon = 4 - 3 = 1$.\n\n**Step 3: The Hyperscaling Relation for α**\nIn RG theory, critical exponents are not all independent. They are connected by scaling and hyperscaling relations. The specific heat exponent $\\alpha$ is related to the correlation length exponent $\\nu$ and the spatial dimension $d$ through the Josephson hyperscaling relation:\n$\\alpha = 2 - d\\nu$\n\nThis relation is a fundamental result of RG and is expected to hold for dimensions $d \\le d_c$. To find $\\alpha$, we first need to find the expression for $\\nu$ in the $\\epsilon$-expansion.\n\n**Step 4: Identifying the Universality Class (A Careful Point)**\nCritical exponents depend on the spatial dimension $d$ and the symmetries of the system's order parameter, which is characterized by the number of its components, $n$.\n*   $n=1$: Ising universality class (e.g., liquid-gas transition, uniaxial magnet).\n*   $n=2$: XY universality class (e.g., superfluid transition in Helium-4).\n*   $n=3$: Heisenberg universality class (e.g., isotropic ferromagnet).\n\nThe question does not specify the value of $n$. In such cases, it is standard practice to assume the most fundamental and commonly discussed case, which is the **Ising universality class ($n=1$)**. We will proceed with this assumption.\n\n**Step 5: The Epsilon Expansion for the Exponent ν**\nFor the general O(n) model, the correlation length exponent $\\nu$ can be calculated as a power series in $\\epsilon$. To the first order in $\\epsilon$, the result is:\n$\\nu = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{n+2}{4(n+8)}\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n\nFor our assumed Ising case ($n=1$):\n$\\nu = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1+2}{4(1+8)}\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n$\\nu = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{3}{36}\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n$\\nu = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{12}\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n\n**Step 6: Calculating α to First Order in ε**\nNow we substitute the expansion for $\\nu$ into the hyperscaling relation $\\alpha = 2 - d\\nu$. A crucial point in this step is to also express the dimension $d$ in terms of $\\epsilon$ to maintain consistency in the expansion. Since $\\epsilon = 4 - d$, we have $d = 4 - \\epsilon$.\n\n$\\alpha = 2 - (4 - \\epsilon) \\nu$\nSubstitute the expression for $\\nu$:\n$\\alpha = 2 - (4 - \\epsilon) \\left( \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{12}\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2) \\right)$\n\nNow, expand the product and keep terms only up to the first order in $\\epsilon$:\n$\\alpha = 2 - \\left[ 4 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} + 4 \\cdot \\frac{1}{12}\\epsilon - \\epsilon \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} + O(\\epsilon^2) \\right]$\n$\\alpha = 2 - \\left[ 2 + \\frac{1}{3}\\epsilon - \\frac{1}{2}\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2) \\right]$\n$\\alpha = 2 - 2 - \\frac{1}{3}\\epsilon + \\frac{1}{2}\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n$\\alpha = \\left( \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{3} \\right) \\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n$\\alpha = \\left( \\frac{3 - 2}{6} \\right) \\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n$\\alpha = \\frac{1}{6}\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n\n**Step 7: Final Answer for d=3**\nTo obtain the numerical value for $d=3$, we substitute $\\epsilon=1$ into our first-order expression for $\\alpha$.\n\n$\\alpha \\approx \\frac{1}{6}$\n\nThis is the first-order approximation from the $\\epsilon$-expansion. It's important to note that since the expansion parameter $\\epsilon=1$ is not small, this is an approximation. The experimentally and numerically confirmed value for the 3D Ising model is closer to $\\alpha \\approx 0.110$, but $1/6 \\approx 0.167$ is the correct result to first order in the $\\epsilon$-expansion.\n\n### List of Careful Points\n\n1.  **Universality Class:** The result depends on the number of order parameter components, $n$. The problem is solved under the common assumption that it refers to the Ising model ($n=1$).\n2.  **Expansion Consistency:** When substituting the $\\epsilon$-expansion for an exponent ($\\nu$) into a hyperscaling relation ($\\alpha = 2-d\\nu$), the dimension $d$ must also be written in terms of $\\epsilon$ (as $d=4-\\epsilon$) to get a consistent result.\n3.  **Approximation Quality:** The $\\epsilon$-expansion is formally exact only in the limit $\\epsilon \\to 0$. Using it for $d=3$ (where $\\epsilon=1$) provides an approximation, not an exact value. The accuracy depends on the convergence of the series.\n4.  **Validity of Hyperscaling:** The relation $\\alpha=2-d\\nu$ is itself a result of RG that is valid at and below the upper critical dimension $d_c=4$. Above $d_c$, it fails, and the mean-field value $\\alpha=0$ holds.\n\n### Final Answer\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the value of the exponent $\\alpha$ to first order in the $\\epsilon$-expansion is $1/6$.\n\n<<<1/6>>>"
