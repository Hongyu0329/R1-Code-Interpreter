    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the sequence to find the next number.\n\n**Step 1: Initial Observation and Analysis**\nThe given sequence is:\n111, 142, 111, 41, 67, 67, 67, 93, 111, 111, 62, 62, 111, 111, 36, 36, 49, 155, 49, 62, 49, 49, 62, 62, 10, 36, 36, 36, 124, 124, 124, 36, 124\n\nA first look at the sequence shows that it is not a simple arithmetic or geometric progression. The differences between consecutive terms are irregular. This suggests a more complex or non-mathematical pattern.\n\n**Step 2: Identifying Key Structural Features**\nA careful point to note is the frequent repetition of numbers. We can observe several \"runs\" or \"blocks\" of identical consecutive numbers.\n*   `67, 67, 67` (a run of 3)\n*   `111, 111` (a run of 2)\n*   `62, 62` (a run of 2)\n*   `111, 111` (a run of 2)\n*   `36, 36` (a run of 2)\n*   `49, 49` (a run of 2)\n*   `62, 62` (a run of 2)\n*   `36, 36, 36` (a run of 3)\n*   `124, 124, 124` (a run of 3)\n\nThe existence of these runs is a major clue to the underlying pattern.\n\n**Step 3: Analyzing the Start of Repetitive Blocks**\nLet's examine the numbers that immediately precede these repeating blocks. This could reveal the rule for how a new run starts.\n\n*   `..., 93, **111, 111**` (A run of 111s starts after 93)\n*   `..., 111, **62, 62**` (A run of 62s starts after 111)\n*   `..., 62, **111, 111**` (A run of 111s starts after 62)\n*   `..., 111, **36, 36**` (A run of 36s starts after 111)\n*   `..., 62, **49, 49**` (A run of 49s starts after 62)\n*   `..., 49, **62, 62**` (A run of 62s starts after 49)\n\nIn each of these cases, the start of a repeating block of a number `x` follows the pattern `y, x, x`, where `y` is the preceding number. This pattern is very consistent throughout the sequence.\n\n**Step 4: Applying the Pattern to the End of the Sequence**\nNow, let's look at the tail end of the sequence:\n`..., 124, 124, 124, 36, 124`\n\nThe last two numbers are `36, 124`. This pair perfectly fits the `y, x` structure we identified as the precursor to a repeating block.\n*   Let `y = 36`\n*   Let `x = 124`\n\nFollowing the established rule (`y, x, x, ...`), the number that should follow `36, 124` is `x`.\n\n**Step 5: Acquiring the Final Answer**\nBased on the pattern, the next number in the sequence should be `124`, which would start a new run (`..., 36, 124, 124, ...`). This provides a consistent and logical conclusion based on the internal structure of the sequence.\n\n<<<124>>>"
