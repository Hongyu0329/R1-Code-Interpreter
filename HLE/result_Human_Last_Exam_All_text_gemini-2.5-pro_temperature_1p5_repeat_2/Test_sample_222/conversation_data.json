    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Problem and Define the Sequence**\n\nWe are given the 4-point Discrete Fourier Transforms (DFTs) of two 4-point sequences, `x(n)` and `h(n)`.\n*   `X(k) = DFT{x(n)} = [1, j, -1, -j]` for `k = 0, 1, 2, 3`.\n*   `H(k) = DFT{h(n)} = [0, 1+j, 1, 1-j]` for `k = 0, 1, 2, 3`.\n\nWe need to find the 8-point DFT of a new 8-point sequence, let's call it `y(n)`, which is formed by interleaving `x(n)` and `h(n)`:\n`y(n) = {x(0), h(0), x(1), h(1), x(2), h(2), x(3), h(3)}`\n\nWe can express the elements of `y(n)` based on whether the index `n` is even or odd:\n*   For even indices `n = 2m`: `y(2m) = x(m)` for `m = 0, 1, 2, 3`.\n*   For odd indices `n = 2m+1`: `y(2m+1) = h(m)` for `m = 0, 1, 2, 3`.\n\n**2. Relate the 8-Point DFT of y(n) to the 4-Point DFTs of x(n) and h(n)**\n\nThe 8-point DFT of `y(n)`, denoted as `Y(k)`, is given by the formula:\n`Y(k) = sum_{n=0}^{7} y(n) * W_8^(nk)`, where `W_N = e^(-j*2*pi/N)`.\n\nWe can split the summation into even and odd indexed terms of `n`:\n`Y(k) = sum_{m=0}^{3} y(2m) * W_8^((2m)k) + sum_{m=0}^{3} y(2m+1) * W_8^((2m+1)k)`\n\nNow, substitute `y(2m) = x(m)` and `y(2m+1) = h(m)`:\n`Y(k) = sum_{m=0}^{3} x(m) * W_8^(2mk) + sum_{m=0}^{3} h(m) * W_8^((2m+1)k)`\n\nSimplify the twiddle factors:\n*   `W_8^2 = e^(-j*2*pi*2/8) = e^(-j*pi/2) = W_4^1`. So, `W_8^(2mk) = (W_8^2)^(mk) = W_4^(mk)`.\n*   `W_8^((2m+1)k) = W_8^(2mk) * W_8^k = W_4^(mk) * W_8^k`.\n\nSubstituting these back into the equation for `Y(k)`:\n`Y(k) = (sum_{m=0}^{3} x(m) * W_4^(mk)) + W_8^k * (sum_{m=0}^{3} h(m) * W_4^(mk))`\n\nThe sums are the definitions of the 4-point DFTs of `x(n)` and `h(n)`:\n*   `sum_{m=0}^{3} x(m) * W_4^(mk) = X(k)`\n*   `sum_{m=0}^{3} h(m) * W_4^(mk) = H(k)`\n\nThis gives us the formulas for `Y(k)`. This is a standard result from the Decimation-In-Time (DIT) Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm.\nFor `k = 0, 1, 2, 3`:\n*   `Y(k) = X(k) + W_8^k * H(k)`\n*   `Y(k+4) = X(k) - W_8^k * H(k)`\n\n**3. List Necessary Values**\n\n*   `X(k) = [1, j, -1, -j]`\n*   `H(k) = [0, 1+j, 1, 1-j]`\n*   Twiddle Factors `W_8^k` for `k=0, 1, 2, 3`:\n    *   `W_8^0 = 1`\n    *   `W_8^1 = e^(-j*pi/4) = cos(pi/4) - j*sin(pi/4) = (1 - j) / sqrt(2)`\n    *   `W_8^2 = e^(-j*pi/2) = -j`\n    *   `W_8^3 = e^(-j*3*pi/4) = cos(3pi/4) - j*sin(3pi/4) = (-1 - j) / sqrt(2)`\n\n**4. Calculate Y(k) for k = 0, 1, 2, 3**\n\n*   **Y(0):** `Y(0) = X(0) + W_8^0 * H(0) = 1 + 1 * 0 = 1`\n*   **Y(1):** `Y(1) = X(1) + W_8^1 * H(1) = j + ((1 - j) / sqrt(2)) * (1 + j) = j + (1 - j^2) / sqrt(2) = j + 2 / sqrt(2) = sqrt(2) + j`\n*   **Y(2):** `Y(2) = X(2) + W_8^2 * H(2) = -1 + (-j) * 1 = -1 - j`\n*   **Y(3):** `Y(3) = X(3) + W_8^3 * H(3) = -j + ((-1 - j) / sqrt(2)) * (1 - j) = -j + (-1 + j - j + j^2) / sqrt(2) = -j + (-2 / sqrt(2)) = -sqrt(2) - j`\n\n**5. Calculate Y(k) for k = 4, 5, 6, 7**\n\nWe use the formula `Y(k+4) = X(k) - W_8^k * H(k)`.\n\n*   **Y(4) (k=0):** `Y(4) = X(0) - W_8^0 * H(0) = 1 - 1 * 0 = 1`\n*   **Y(5) (k=1):** `Y(5) = X(1) - W_8^1 * H(1) = j - sqrt(2) = -sqrt(2) + j`\n*   **Y(6) (k=2):** `Y(6) = X(2) - W_8^2 * H(2) = -1 - (-j) * 1 = -1 + j`\n*   **Y(7) (k=3):** `Y(7) = X(3) - W_8^3 * H(3) = -j - (-sqrt(2)) = sqrt(2) - j`\n\n**6. Final Answer**\n\nCombining all the calculated values, the 8-point DFT `Y(k)` is:\n`Y(k) = [1,  sqrt(2) + j,  -1 - j,  -sqrt(2) - j,  1,  -sqrt(2) + j,  -1 + j,  sqrt(2) - j]`\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n1.  **Correctly identify the relationship:** The key is to recognize that `y(n)` is an interleaving of `x(n)` and `h(n)`, making them the even and odd parts of `y(n)`, respectively.\n2.  **Use the correct DFT size:** The target DFT is an 8-point DFT, so 8-point twiddle factors (`W_8^k`) must be used.\n3.  **Correctly apply the DIT-FFT formulas:** The combination of smaller DFTs into a larger one follows a specific structure (`Y(k) = X(k) + ...` and `Y(k+4) = X(k) - ...`).\n4.  **Complex Number Arithmetic:** Be careful with multiplications of complex numbers, especially with terms like `(1-j)(1+j) = 2` and `j^2 = -1`.\n5.  **Periodicity of X(k) and H(k):** While the input DFTs are 4-point and thus periodic with period 4, the formulas only require `X(k)` and `H(k)` for `k = 0, 1, 2, 3`, so no periodicity needs to be invoked.\n\n<<<[1, sqrt(2)+j, -1-j, -sqrt(2)-j, 1, -sqrt(2)+j, -1+j, sqrt(2)-j]>>>"
