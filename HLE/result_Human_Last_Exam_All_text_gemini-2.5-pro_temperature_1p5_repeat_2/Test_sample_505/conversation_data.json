    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the maximum number of logical qubits.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understanding Logical Qubits in Surface Codes**\n\n*   **Basic Unit (Patch):** A single, standard patch of a planar surface code is designed to encode **one logical qubit**. The logical operators for this qubit are defined by strings of physical qubit operations that stretch between different types of boundaries of the patch (e.g., between a \"rough\" boundary and another \"rough\" boundary).\n*   **Role of Holes (Defects):** Holes are essentially internal boundaries created within a surface code patch. They provide additional topological features that can be used to define more logical qubits. For each hole you introduce into a patch, you gain the capacity to encode **one additional logical qubit**.\n*   **Formula for a Single Patch:** Based on the above points, the number of logical qubits (`k`) that can be encoded in a single patch with `h` holes is given by the formula:\n    `k = 1 (from the patch itself) + h (from the holes)`\n    `k = 1 + h`\n\n**2. Analyzing the System Configuration**\n\n*   **Number of Patches (P):** The problem states we have **two patches** of surface code (`P = 2`). Since these patches are separate, they are independent systems.\n*   **Number of Holes (H):** We have a total of **two holes** (`H = 2`) that can be created across these patches.\n*   **Combining Patches:** For a system of multiple disconnected patches, the total number of logical qubits is simply the sum of the logical qubits encoded in each individual patch.\n    `k_total = k_patch_1 + k_patch_2`\n\n**3. Evaluating Possible Scenarios**\n\nThe two holes can be distributed among the two patches in two distinct ways. We need to calculate the total number of logical qubits for each scenario to find the maximum.\n\n*   **Scenario A: One hole in each patch.**\n    *   Patch 1: Has `h1 = 1` hole. Number of logical qubits `k1 = 1 + h1 = 1 + 1 = 2`.\n    *   Patch 2: Has `h2 = 1` hole. Number of logical qubits `k2 = 1 + h2 = 1 + 1 = 2`.\n    *   **Total logical qubits = k1 + k2 = 2 + 2 = 4**.\n\n*   **Scenario B: Both holes in one patch.**\n    *   Patch 1: Has `h1 = 2` holes. Number of logical qubits `k1 = 1 + h1 = 1 + 2 = 3`.\n    *   Patch 2: Has `h2 = 0` holes. Number of logical qubits `k2 = 1 + h2 = 1 + 0 = 1`.\n    *   **Total logical qubits = k1 + k2 = 3 + 1 = 4**.\n\n**4. Determining the Final Answer**\n\n*   Both possible configurations for distributing the two holes among the two patches result in a total of 4 logical qubits.\n*   The question asks for the maximum (\"at most\") number of logical qubits. Since all configurations yield the same result, the maximum is 4.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   A simple surface code patch without any holes already encodes one qubit due to its boundary conditions. This is a common point of confusion.\n*   The number of logical qubits scales additively. The capacity of two separate patches is the sum of their individual capacities.\n*   The number of additional logical qubits provided by holes is equal to the number of holes themselves.\n*   The general formula for this problem is `k_total = P + H`, where `P` is the number of patches and `H` is the total number of holes. In this case, `k_total = 2 (patches) + 2 (holes) = 4`.\n\n### Final Answer Acquisition\n\n1.  **Logical qubits per patch:** `k_patch = 1 + h` (where `h` is the number of holes in that patch).\n2.  **Total logical qubits:** `k_total = k_patch_1 + k_patch_2`.\n3.  Let `h1` and `h2` be the holes in patch 1 and 2, such that `h1 + h2 = 2`.\n4.  `k_total = (1 + h1) + (1 + h2) = 2 + (h1 + h2)`.\n5.  Substitute `h1 + h2 = 2` into the equation: `k_total = 2 + 2 = 4`.\n6.  Since this result is independent of the distribution of holes, the maximum number is 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
