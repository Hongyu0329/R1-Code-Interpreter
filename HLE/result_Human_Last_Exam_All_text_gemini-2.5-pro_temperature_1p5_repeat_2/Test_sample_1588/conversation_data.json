    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of nonzero coefficients of order 10 in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) expansion.\n\n**1. Understand the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) Formula and its Symmetries**\n\nThe BCH formula gives the solution $Z$ to the equation $e^Z = e^X e^Y$ for non-commuting $X$ and $Y$. The solution is expressed as a series of homogeneous Lie polynomials:\n$Z(X, Y) = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty Z_n(X, Y)$\nwhere $Z_n(X, Y)$ is a sum of nested commutators of $X$ and $Y$ of total degree $n$. These $Z_n$ are elements of the free Lie algebra on two generators, denoted $\\mathcal{L}_n(X, Y)$.\n\nThe question concerns the term $Z_{10}(X, Y)$. A key property of the BCH series is its symmetry under the exchange of $X$ and $Y$. Let $\\sigma$ be the operator that swaps $X$ and $Y$. The series satisfies:\n$Z_n(X, Y) = (-1)^{n+1} \\sigma(Z_n(X, Y))$\nFor $n=10$, this becomes:\n$Z_{10}(X, Y) = (-1)^{11} \\sigma(Z_{10}(X, Y)) = - \\sigma(Z_{10}(X, Y))$\nThis means that $Z_{10}$ is an **anti-symmetric** element of the Lie algebra $\\mathcal{L}_{10}(X, Y)$.\n\n**2. Relate Coefficients to a Symmetry-Adapted Basis**\n\nThe vector space $\\mathcal{L}_{10}(X, Y)$ can be decomposed into a direct sum of a symmetric subspace $\\mathcal{L}_{10}^S$ (where elements $P$ satisfy $\\sigma(P) = P$) and an anti-symmetric subspace $\\mathcal{L}_{10}^A$ (where elements $P$ satisfy $\\sigma(P) = -P$).\n$\\mathcal{L}_{10} = \\mathcal{L}_{10}^S \\oplus \\mathcal{L}_{10}^A$\n\nSince $Z_{10}$ is anti-symmetric, it must lie entirely within the subspace $\\mathcal{L}_{10}^A$. If we express $Z_{10}$ in a basis that is \"adapted\" to this symmetry (i.e., a basis composed of purely symmetric and purely anti-symmetric elements), then all its components in the symmetric subspace will be zero.\n\nThe question \"What is the number of nonzero coefficients?\" is interpreted in this context to mean the number of basis vectors from $\\mathcal{L}_{10}^A$ that are needed to express $Z_{10}$. It is a widely held principle in this area (and supported by all computational evidence) that there are no \"accidental\" zero coefficients. This means that $Z_{10}$ has a non-zero component for *every* basis vector of the subspace $\\mathcal{L}_{10}^A$.\n\nTherefore, the number of non-zero coefficients is equal to the dimension of the anti-symmetric subspace, $\\dim(\\mathcal{L}_{10}^A)$.\n\n**3. Calculate the Dimension of the Anti-Symmetric Subspace**\n\nWe can calculate $\\dim(\\mathcal{L}_{10}^A)$ using character theory. The formula is:\n$\\dim(\\mathcal{L}_{10}^A) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\dim(\\mathcal{L}_{10}) - \\text{Tr}(\\sigma|_{\\mathcal{L}_{10}}) \\right)$\nwhere $\\text{Tr}(\\sigma|_{\\mathcal{L}_{10}})$ is the trace of the exchange operator $\\sigma$ acting on the space $\\mathcal{L}_{10}$.\n\n**Step 3a: Calculate $\\dim(\\mathcal{L}_{10})$**\nThe dimension of the free Lie algebra $\\mathcal{L}_n$ on $k$ generators is given by Witt's formula:\n$\\dim(\\mathcal{L}_n) = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{d|n} \\mu(d) k^{n/d}$\nHere, $n=10$ and we have $k=2$ generators ($X, Y$). The divisors of 10 are $d \\in \\{1, 2, 5, 10\\}$. The MÃ¶bius function values are $\\mu(1)=1, \\mu(2)=-1, \\mu(5)=-1, \\mu(10)=1$.\n\n$\\dim(\\mathcal{L}_{10}) = \\frac{1}{10} \\left( \\mu(1)2^{10/1} + \\mu(2)2^{10/2} + \\mu(5)2^{10/5} + \\mu(10)2^{10/10} \\right)$\n$\\dim(\\mathcal{L}_{10}) = \\frac{1}{10} \\left( 1 \\cdot 2^{10} - 1 \\cdot 2^5 - 1 \\cdot 2^2 + 1 \\cdot 2^1 \\right)$\n$\\dim(\\mathcal{L}_{10}) = \\frac{1}{10} \\left( 1024 - 32 - 4 + 2 \\right)$\n$\\dim(\\mathcal{L}_{10}) = \\frac{1}{10} (990) = 99$\n\n**Step 3b: Calculate $\\text{Tr}(\\sigma|_{\\mathcal{L}_{10}})$**\nThe trace of a permutation of generators acting on a Lie algebra has a specific formula analogous to Witt's formula. For the exchange operator $\\sigma$ on two generators:\n$\\text{Tr}(\\sigma|_{\\mathcal{L}_n}) = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{d|n} \\mu(d) \\text{Tr}(\\sigma^d|_{\\langle X,Y \\rangle^{n/d}})$\nwhere $\\text{Tr}(\\sigma^d|_{\\langle X,Y \\rangle^{m}})$ is the trace of $\\sigma^d$ acting on the space of words of length $m$. This trace is $(\\text{Tr}(\\sigma^d|_{\\langle X,Y\\rangle}))^m$.\n\nThe trace of $\\sigma$ on the space of generators $\\langle X,Y\\rangle$ is 0.\nThe trace of $\\sigma^2=e$ (the identity) on $\\langle X,Y\\rangle$ is 2.\n\nFor $n=10$, we evaluate the terms:\n*   $d=1$: $\\mu(1)=1$. Term involves $\\text{Tr}(\\sigma^1) = 0$. Contribution is 0.\n*   $d=2$: $\\mu(2)=-1$. Term involves $\\text{Tr}(\\sigma^2|_{\\langle X,Y \\rangle^5}) = (\\text{Tr}(e))^5 = 2^5=32$. Contribution is $(-1) \\cdot 32 = -32$.\n*   $d=5$: $\\mu(5)=-1$. Term involves $\\text{Tr}(\\sigma^5) = \\text{Tr}(\\sigma) = 0$. Contribution is 0.\n*   $d=10$: $\\mu(10)=1$. Term involves $\\text{Tr}(\\sigma^{10}|_{\\langle X,Y \\rangle^1}) = \\text{Tr}(e)^1 = 2^1=2$. Contribution is $1 \\cdot 2 = 2$.\n\nSumming the contributions and dividing by $n=10$:\n$\\text{Tr}(\\sigma|_{\\mathcal{L}_{10}}) = \\frac{1}{10} (0 - 32 + 0 + 2) = \\frac{-30}{10} = -3$\n\n**Step 3c: Final Calculation**\nNow we have all the components to find the dimension of the anti-symmetric subspace:\n$\\dim(\\mathcal{L}_{10}^A) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\dim(\\mathcal{L}_{10}) - \\text{Tr}(\\sigma|_{\\mathcal{L}_{10}}) \\right)$\n$\\dim(\\mathcal{L}_{10}^A) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( 99 - (-3) \\right)$\n$\\dim(\\mathcal{L}_{10}^A) = \\frac{1}{2} (102) = 51$\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nThe number of nonzero coefficients of order 10 in the BCH expansion is equal to the dimension of the anti-symmetric subspace of the free Lie algebra of degree 10 on two generators, which we calculated to be 51.\n\n<<<51>>>"
