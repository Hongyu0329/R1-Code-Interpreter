    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rule activation level.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Question\n\n1.  **Identify the System Type:** The system is based on an **interval type-3 fuzzy set**. This is a very advanced type of fuzzy system where the membership grades themselves have a high degree of uncertainty. In an interval type-3 system, the membership grade of an element is represented by an interval type-2 fuzzy set. However, the question provides simplified, crisp (single number) values, which suggests we should focus on the fundamental operation rather than the complex structure of the sets themselves. The provided values (`0.7` and `0.9`) are likely representative values (like the peak or center) of these more complex sets.\n\n2.  **Identify the Given Values:**\n    *   **`Phi_k(x′) = 0.7`**: This represents the **antecedent firing strength** for the *k*-th rule given a specific input `x'`. It is the overall degree of truth for the \"IF\" part of the fuzzy rule.\n    *   **`μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9`**: This represents the **consequent membership value**. It is the degree to which the specific output value `y_j` belongs to the fuzzy set `G_k` defined in the \"THEN\" part of the *k*-th rule.\n\n3.  **Identify the Operation:**\n    *   The question asks for the **\"rule activation level\"** using a **\"t-norm operation\"**. In fuzzy inference systems, the rule activation level (or the result of the fuzzy implication step) is calculated by combining the antecedent firing strength with the consequent membership function. This process determines the output fuzzy set for that specific rule.\n    *   A **t-norm** (triangular norm) is a function that generalizes the logical AND operation. It is used to combine fuzzy values.\n\n4.  **Determine the Calculation:**\n    *   The activation of the consequent is determined by the truth of the antecedent. The output membership cannot exceed the firing strength of the rule's premise.\n    *   The calculation is therefore: `Rule Activation Level = T(antecedent_firing_strength, consequent_membership_value)`, where `T` is the chosen t-norm.\n    *   Substituting the given values: `Rule Activation Level = T(0.7, 0.9)`.\n\n5.  **Select the Specific T-Norm:**\n    *   The problem states to use \"a t-norm\" without specifying which one. The two most common t-norms used in fuzzy systems are:\n        *   **Minimum (min):** `T(a, b) = min(a, b)`. This is the most common t-norm, used in Mamdani-style inference.\n        *   **Product (prod):** `T(a, b) = a * b`. This is used in Larsen-style inference.\n    *   In the absence of a specific instruction, the **minimum (min)** operator is the standard and most widely assumed choice.\n\n### List of Careful Points\n\n*   **Complexity of Type-3 Sets:** Be aware that \"interval type-3 fuzzy set\" implies a highly complex structure. However, the problem provides simple scalar values. This indicates that you should apply the fundamental principle of fuzzy implication to these representative values, rather than getting lost in the full complexity of type-3 theory.\n*   **Ambiguity of \"Rule Activation Level\":** This term can sometimes refer just to the antecedent firing strength (`0.7` in this case). However, when a consequent membership value (`0.9`) is also provided along with a request to use a t-norm, it almost always refers to the result of the implication step (i.e., combining the two values).\n*   **Choice of T-Norm:** The result depends on the chosen t-norm. Since one is not specified, using the most standard one (minimum) is the most logical approach. The minimum t-norm effectively \"clips\" the consequent fuzzy set at the level of the antecedent's firing strength.\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer\n\nFollowing the analysis, the final calculation is performed by applying the standard minimum t-norm to the given values.\n\n*   **Step 1:** Set the antecedent firing strength: `antecedent_strength = Phi_k(x′) = 0.7`.\n*   **Step 2:** Set the consequent membership value: `consequent_membership = μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9`.\n*   **Step 3:** Apply the minimum t-norm to find the rule activation level at the specific output point `y_j`.\n    `Rule Activation Level = min(antecedent_strength, consequent_membership)`\n    `Rule Activation Level = min(0.7, 0.9)`\n*   **Step 4:** Compute the minimum.\n    `Rule Activation Level = 0.7`\n\nThe activation level of the rule's consequent is capped by the firing strength of its antecedent. Since the antecedent firing strength (0.7) is less than the original consequent membership (0.9), the resulting activation level is 0.7.\n\n<<<0.7>>>"
