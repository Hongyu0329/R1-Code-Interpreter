    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the solution.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\nThe question asks for the ratio of the uncertainty in an electron's momentum (`Δp`) to its actual momentum (`p`) while it is in the first Bohr orbit. This ratio can be written as `Δp / p`.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Given Information and Relevant Principles**\n*   **Electron's state:** It is in the first Bohr orbit (`n=1`).\n*   **Uncertainty in position:** `Δx = 10 pm`.\n*   **Relevant Principle 1: Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle.** This principle connects the uncertainty in a particle's position (`Δx`) with the uncertainty in its momentum (`Δp`). The mathematical relation is:\n    `Δx * Δp ≥ ħ / 2`\n    where `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant (`ħ = h / 2π ≈ 1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s`). For calculation, we will consider the minimum possible uncertainty, so we use the equality:\n    `Δp = ħ / (2 * Δx)`\n*   **Relevant Principle 2: Bohr Model of the Atom.** This model describes the momentum of an electron in specific orbits. The angular momentum (`L`) is quantized:\n    `L = mvr = nħ`\n    where `m` is mass, `v` is velocity, `r` is the orbit radius, and `n` is the principal quantum number.\n    The linear momentum is `p = mv`. Substituting this into the angular momentum equation gives:\n    `p * r = nħ`\n    So, the momentum is:\n    `p = nħ / r`\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Uncertainty in Momentum (Δp)**\n1.  Convert the given `Δx` to SI units (meters).\n    `Δx = 10 pm = 10 × 10⁻¹² m = 1 × 10⁻¹¹ m`\n2.  Use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle formula to find `Δp`.\n    `Δp = ħ / (2 * Δx)`\n    We can leave this in terms of `ħ` for now to simplify later calculations.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Momentum in the First Bohr Orbit (p)**\n1.  For the first Bohr orbit, the principal quantum number is `n=1`.\n2.  The radius of the first Bohr orbit (`r₁`) is a known constant, the Bohr radius (`a₀`).\n    `r₁ = a₀ ≈ 0.529 × 10⁻¹⁰ m`\n3.  Use the Bohr model formula for momentum with `n=1`.\n    `p = (1 * ħ) / r₁ = ħ / a₀`\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Final Ratio (Δp / p)**\n1.  Now, we form the ratio using the expressions for `Δp` and `p` derived in the previous steps.\n    `Ratio = Δp / p = [ħ / (2 * Δx)] / [ħ / a₀]`\n2.  The reduced Planck constant `ħ` appears in both the numerator and the denominator, so it cancels out. This simplifies the calculation significantly.\n    `Ratio = [1 / (2 * Δx)] * [a₀ / 1]`\n    `Ratio = a₀ / (2 * Δx)`\n3.  Substitute the known values for `a₀` and `Δx` into this simplified formula.\n    `a₀ = 0.529 × 10⁻¹⁰ m`\n    `Δx = 1 × 10⁻¹¹ m`\n4.  Perform the final calculation.\n    `Ratio = (0.529 × 10⁻¹⁰ m) / (2 * 1 × 10⁻¹¹ m)`\n    `Ratio = (0.529 × 10⁻¹⁰) / (2 × 10⁻¹¹)`\n    `Ratio = (5.29 × 10⁻¹¹) / (2 × 10⁻¹¹)`\n    `Ratio = 5.29 / 2`\n    `Ratio = 2.645`\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n*   **Units:** Ensure all values are in consistent SI units (meters in this case) before performing the final calculation.\n*   **Formulas:** Use the correct forms of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle (`ħ/2`, not `h`) and the Bohr momentum formula.\n*   **Simplification:** Notice that `ħ` cancels out. Solving the ratio algebraically first makes the calculation much simpler and less prone to errors from typing long constant values into a calculator.\n*   **Interpretation:** The result is a dimensionless ratio, as expected. A value greater than 1 means the uncertainty in the electron's momentum is larger than the momentum itself, which highlights the breakdown of the classical concept of a well-defined orbit at this scale.\n\n<<<2.645>>>"
