    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Key Concepts**\n\n*   **Population Axiology:** This is a field of ethics that studies how to evaluate populations of different sizes and different welfare levels. It tries to answer questions like \"Is it better to have a world with a few extremely happy people or a world with many people who are only moderately happy?\"\n*   **Critical-Level Views:** This is a family of theories in population axiology. They propose that the value of a population is calculated by summing up the \"contributive value\" of each individual's life. The contributive value is the person's welfare level (`w`) minus a fixed \"critical level\" (`c`). So, the value of a population is the sum of `(w_i - c)` for all individuals `i`.\n    *   A key feature is that if the critical level `c` is positive, adding a new person to the world is only a good thing if their welfare level is *above* this critical level. Adding someone with welfare below `c` makes the world worse, even if their life is worth living (i.e., their welfare is positive).\n*   **Arrhenius's Impossibility Theorems:** These are a series of proofs showing that it is impossible for any single population axiology to satisfy a set of conditions that, on their own, seem very reasonable and desirable. The sixth theorem uses a specific combination of such conditions.\n\n**Step 2: List and Define the Conditions of Arrhenius's Sixth Impossibility Theorem**\n\nTo find which condition is violated, we must first understand what each condition demands.\n\n1.  **Non-Elitism:** This condition is designed to prevent certain welfare levels from being \"lexically\" superior to others. It states that for any welfare level `w`, one life at that level cannot be better than *any* number of lives at a welfare level `w'` that is just slightly lower than `w`. In other words, quantity should eventually be able to make up for a small drop in quality.\n2.  **General Non-Extreme Priority:** This condition ensures that we prioritize quantity over quality in some cases. It says that for any two positive welfare levels `w1` (very high) and `w2` (lower, but still positive), a large enough population `m` of people at the lower level `w2` is better than a small population `n` of people at the higher level `w1`. Quantity can eventually trump quality.\n3.  **Egalitarian Dominance:** If two populations have the same number of people and the same total (and average) welfare, then the more equal population is at least as good as the less equal one.\n4.  **Weak Non-Sadism:** Adding a person with a positive welfare level (a life worth living) to a population can never be worse than adding a person with a negative welfare level (a life not worth living).\n5.  **Weak Quality Addition:** This is a very mild condition stating that there is at least one situation where adding a person with a high positive welfare is better than adding a person with a negative welfare. It just ensures the theory makes some quality-based distinctions.\n\n**Step 3: Test Critical-Level Views Against Each Condition**\n\nLet's use a critical-level view where the critical level `c` is a positive number (e.g., c = 20) and welfare can be higher or lower than this.\n\n*   **A. Egalitarian Dominance:** Critical-level views satisfy this. If two populations have the same size (`N`) and same total welfare (`Sum(w_i)`), their value under a critical-level view will be identical: `Value = Sum(w_i) - N*c`. So one is \"at least as good as\" the other.\n*   **D. Weak Non-Sadism & E. Weak Quality Addition:** These are also satisfied. Adding a person with welfare `w > 0` contributes `w-c` to the total value. Adding a person with `z < 0` contributes `z-c`. Since `w > z`, the addition of the happy person is always better.\n*   **B. General Non-Extreme Priority:** This condition is **violated**. The condition says that for *any* two positive levels `w1 > w2 > 0`, quantity can trump quality. But consider a critical-level view with `c=20`. Let's pick `w1=30` and `w2=10`. The condition says that some large number of people at welfare 10 should be better than one person at welfare 30.\n    *   Value of 1 person at 30: `(30 - 20) = 10`.\n    *   Value of `m` people at 10: `m * (10 - 20) = -10m`.\n    *   No matter how large `m` is, the value `-10m` is a large negative number and can never be better than the positive value of 10. The condition fails because the lives at level 10 contribute negatively.\n*   **C. Non-Elitism:** This condition is also **violated**, and in a very direct way. The condition says that for *any* level `w`, a single life at `w` can't be better than *any* number of lives just below `w`. Let's test this at the critical level itself: `w = c = 20`.\n    *   Value of 1 person at `w=20`: `(20 - 20) = 0`.\n    *   Now consider lives just below this, at `w'=19.9`. The value of `n` people at 19.9 is: `n * (19.9 - 20) = -0.1n`.\n    *   A value of 0 is *always* better than a negative value of `-0.1n`, no matter how large `n` becomes. Therefore, one person at the critical level is better than any number of people slightly below it. This is a clear violation of Non-Elitism.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude with the Best Answer**\n\nBoth General Non-Extreme Priority and Non-Elitism are violated by critical-level views. However, the violation of Non-Elitism is arguably more fundamental. The very concept of a \"critical level\" creates an elite threshold (`c`) which has special status. Lives above it are positive, lives below are negative. The violation of Non-Elitism happens precisely at this threshold `c`. The violation of General Non-Extreme Priority is a direct consequence of this elitist structure: because lives below `c` contribute negatively, they cannot be aggregated to outweigh lives that contribute positively. Thus, the primary and most direct violation is Non-Elitism.\n\n<<<C>>>"
