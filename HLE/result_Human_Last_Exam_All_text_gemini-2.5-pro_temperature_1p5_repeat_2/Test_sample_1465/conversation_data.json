    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the oligomeric state of the provided coiled-coil protein sequences.\n\n**Careful Points & Principles:**\n\n1.  **Coiled-Coil Structure:** Coiled-coils consist of Î±-helices wrapped around each other. Their structure is defined by a repeating seven-amino-acid pattern called a heptad repeat, denoted `(abcdefg)n`.\n2.  **Heptad Register:** The assignment of amino acids to the `a, b, c, d, e, f, g` positions is crucial. The sequences are 28 residues long, which corresponds to four full heptad repeats. We will assume the standard register, where the first residue is at the `a` position, the second at `b`, and so on. This means:\n    *   `a` positions are residues 1, 8, 15, 22.\n    *   `d` positions are residues 4, 11, 18, 25.\n    *   `e` positions are residues 5, 12, 19, 26.\n    *   `g` positions are residues 7, 14, 21, 28.\n3.  **Hydrophobic Core (`a`, `d` positions):** The residues at the `a` and `d` positions form the hydrophobic core, which is the primary driving force for oligomerization. The identity of these residues is the main determinant of the oligomeric state.\n    *   **Harbury's Rules:** The seminal work by Harbury et al. showed that specific combinations of Ile (I) and Leu (L) direct oligomerization: (I at `a`, L at `d`) -> Dimer; (I at `a`, I at `d`) -> Trimer; (L at `a`, I at `d`) -> Tetramer.\n4.  **Non-Canonical Core Residues:** The given sequences contain non-canonical residues (polar, charged, or very bulky) in the core. Their effects must be considered:\n    *   **Polar Residues (N, Q):** Asparagine (N) at an `a` position strongly specifies a parallel dimer through inter-chain hydrogen bonds. Glutamine (Q) can also form H-bonds and is often found in higher-order oligomers.\n    *   **Bulky Residues (W):** Very bulky residues like Tryptophan (W) at `a` or `d` positions often force higher-order oligomerization (like tetramers) to accommodate their size.\n5.  **Flanking Positions (`e`, `g` positions):** These positions flank the hydrophobic core. Charged residues at these positions can form stabilizing inter-helical salt bridges, most commonly `g-e'` (a `g` residue on one helix interacting with an `e` residue on the adjacent helix). These interactions can provide specificity for a certain oligomeric state. For instance, an `E` at `a` and `K` at `g` `(Ea-Kg')` or `E` at `a` and `K` at `e` `(Ea-Ke')` are strong indicators of a dimeric state.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis of Each Sequence:**\n\n**Sequence 1: `EIAQALKEIAKALKEIAWALKEIAQALK`**\n*   **`a` positions:** E, E, E, E\n*   **`d` positions:** Q, K, W, Q\n*   **`g` positions:** K, K, K, K\n*   **Analysis:** The core is filled with charged (`E`, `K`) and polar (`Q`) residues. This is highly unfavorable. However, we see Glutamate (`E`) consistently at the `a` position and Lysine (`K`) consistently at the `g` position. This allows for the formation of favorable `Ea-Kg'` inter-helical salt bridges, which are a strong determining factor for a parallel **Dimer (2)**.\n\n**Sequence 2: `EIAALKQEIAALKKENAALKQEIAALKQ`**\n*   **`a` positions:** E, E, N, E\n*   **`d` positions:** A, A, A, A\n*   **Analysis:** This sequence contains an Asparagine (`N`) at the `a` position in the third heptad. A layer of `N` residues in the core is a classic signature of a parallel **Dimer (2)**, as they form specific hydrogen bonds that lock the dimer in place.\n\n**Sequence 3: `EIAAIKQEIAAIKKEIAAIKWEIAAIKQ`**\n*   **`a` positions:** E, E, E, E\n*   **`d` positions:** I, I, W, I\n*   **Analysis:** The `d` positions are predominantly hydrophobic (`I`). Crucially, there is a very bulky Tryptophan (`W`) at the `d` position of the third heptad. A layer of `W` residues in the `d` position is known to drive the formation of a **Tetramer (4)** to accommodate the bulky side chains. This strong steric factor typically overrides other signals.\n\n**Sequence 4: `EIQKQLKEIQKQLKEIQWQLKEIQKQLK`**\n*   **`a` positions:** E, E, E, E\n*   **`d` positions:** K, K, W, K\n*   **`g` positions:** K, K, K, K\n*   **Analysis:** This is a very unusual sequence with positively charged Lysine (`K`) in the `d` positions, which would be repulsive in a parallel oligomer. However, just like in Sequence 1, the `Ea-Kg'` pattern exists, strongly favoring a dimeric state. The single `W` layer's influence is likely overcome by the strong dimer-specifying salt bridges and the repulsion that `K` at `d` would cause in a higher-order state. The most likely outcome is a **Dimer (2)**.\n\n**Sequence 5: `EIAQTLKEIAKTLKEIAWTLKEIAQTLK`**\n*   **`a` positions:** E, E, E, E\n*   **`e` positions:** T, T, T, T\n*   **`g` positions:** K, K, K, K\n*   **Analysis:** This sequence is almost identical to Sequence 1 (a dimer), but the Alanine (`A`) at every `e` position is replaced by Threonine (`T`). This `A -> T` mutation introduces a polar hydroxyl group flanking the core. This increased polarity at the hydrophobic interface tends to destabilize dimer packing. In a trimer, the `e` positions are more solvent-exposed, making the polar `T` more favorable. This is a known design strategy to switch a coiled-coil from a dimer to a **Trimer (3)**.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nCombining the analysis for each sequence gives the following oligomeric states:\n1.  Dimer (2)\n2.  Dimer (2)\n3.  Tetramer (4)\n4.  Dimer (2)\n5.  Trimer (3)\n\nThe resulting sequence of numbers is **2, 2, 4, 2, 3**. This matches one of the answer choices.\n\n<<<D>>>"
