    "Answering the question involves designing a deadbeat observer for the given discrete-time system. A deadbeat observer drives the observation error to zero in the minimum possible number of time steps. This is achieved by placing all the eigenvalues (poles) of the observer error dynamics at the origin (z=0).\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n**1. System and Observer Definition**\n\nThe discrete-time system is given by:\n`x(k + 1) = Ax(k) + Bu(k)`\n`y(k) = Cx(k)`\nwith matrices:\n`A = [-1 0 0 1; 1 0 0 2; 0 1 0 -1; -1 0 1 -1]`\n`B = [0; 1; -1; 1]`\n`C = [1 0 0 0; 1 0 0 1]`\n\nThe state vector `x` has dimension `n=4`. The output vector `y` has dimension `p=2`.\nA full-order observer has the form:\n`x_hat(k + 1) = A*x_hat(k) + B*u(k) + L*(y(k) - C*x_hat(k))`\nwhere `L` is the `n x p` (i.e., `4 x 2`) observer gain matrix we need to find.\n\nThe dynamics of the observation error `e(k) = x(k) - x_hat(k)` are given by:\n`e(k + 1) = (A - LC)e(k)`\n\nFor a deadbeat observer, we want the error to become zero in the shortest possible time. This requires placing all eigenvalues of the matrix `(A - LC)` at the origin. Thus, the desired characteristic polynomial of `(A - LC)` is `p(z) = z^n = z^4`.\n\n**2. Check for Observability**\n\nBefore we can place the observer poles arbitrarily, we must verify that the system is observable. The system `(A, C)` is observable if its observability matrix `O` has full rank, i.e., `rank(O) = n = 4`. The observability matrix is:\n`O = [C; CA; CA^2; CA^3]`\n\nLet's compute the necessary components:\n`C = [1 0 0 0; 1 0 0 1]`\n`CA = C*A = [-1 0 0 1; -2 0 1 0]`\n`A^2 = A*A = [0 0 1 -2; -3 0 2 -1; 2 0 -1 3; 1 -1 -1 1]`\n`CA^2 = C*A^2 = [0 0 1 -2; 1 -1 0 -1]`\n\nThe observability index `nu` is the smallest integer such that `rank[C; CA; ...; CA^(nu-1)] = n`. Let's test the rank by forming a `4x4` submatrix from the rows of `[C; CA; CA^2]`. Let's select row 1 and 2 from `C`, row 2 from `CA`, and row 2 from `CA^2`:\n`M = [1 0 0 0; 1 0 0 1; -2 0 1 0; 1 -1 0 -1]`\n\nCalculating the determinant of `M`:\n`det(M) = 1 * det([0 0 1; 0 1 0; -1 0 -1]) = 1 * (-(-1) * det([0 1; 1 0])) = 1 * (-1) = -1`\nSince `det(M) != 0`, the matrix `M` has rank 4. This implies `rank(O) = 4`, so the system is observable. The shortest time for the error to converge to zero is the observability index `nu`, which is 3 in this case (since `CA^2` was needed to achieve rank 4).\n\n**3. Observer Gain Design using Duality and Pole Placement**\n\nDesigning the observer gain `L` for `(A, C)` to place poles is dual to designing a state-feedback controller gain `K_dual` for the system `(A', C')`. The eigenvalues of `(A - LC)` are the same as the eigenvalues of `(A' - C'L')`. If we design a feedback gain `K_dual` for the system `(A', C')` such that `(A' - C'K_dual)` has the desired eigenvalues, then our observer gain is `L = K_dual'`.\n\nThe dual system is `z(k+1) = A'z(k) + C'v(k)`, with:\n`A' = [-1 1 0 -1; 0 0 1 0; 0 0 0 1; 1 2 -1 -1]`\n`C' = [1 1; 0 0; 0 0; 0 1]`\n\nThis is a multi-input system (`v` has dimension 2). Pole placement for multi-input systems can be simplified if the system is controllable from a single input channel. Let `c'_1` and `c'_2` be the columns of `C'`:\n`c'_1 = [1; 0; 0; 0]` and `c'_2 = [1; 0; 0; 1]`.\n\nLet's test the controllability of the pair `(A', c'_1)`. The controllability matrix is `Co_1 = [c'_1, A'c'_1, (A')^2c'_1, (A')^3c'_1]`.\n`A'c'_1 = [-1; 0; 0; 1]`\n`(A')^2c'_1 = [0; 0; 1; -2]`\n`(A')^3c'_1 = [2; 1; -2; 1]`\n`Co_1 = [1 -1 0 2; 0 0 0 1; 0 0 1 -2; 0 1 -2 1]`\n`det(Co_1) = 1 * det([0 0 1; 0 1 -2; 1 -2 1]) = 1 * (1 * det([0 1; 1 -2])) = -1 != 0`.\n\nSince `(A', c'_1)` is controllable, we can place the poles using only this input channel. This corresponds to a dual feedback gain `K_dual` of the form `K_dual = [k; 0 0 0 0]`, where `k = [k1 k2 k3 k4]` is a `1x4` row vector. We will find `k` to place the poles of `(A' - c'_1k)` at the origin.\n\nThe characteristic polynomial of `(A' - c'_1k)` is `det(zI - (A' - c'_1k))`. We want this to be `z^4`.\n`A' - c'_1k = [-1-k1  1-k2  -k3  -1-k4; 0 0 1 0; 0 0 0 1; 1 2 -1 -1]`\n`det(zI - (A'-c'_1k)) = det([z+1+k1 -1+k2 k3 1+k4; 0 z -1 0; 0 0 z -1; -1 -2 1 z+1])`\nExpanding the determinant gives the characteristic polynomial:\n`p(z) = z^4 + (2+k1)z^3 + (3+k1+k4)z^2 + (-1+k1+k3)z + (k2-2k1-3)`\n\nWe want `p(z) = z^4`, so we set the coefficients of `z^3`, `z^2`, `z^1`, and `z^0` to zero:\n1.  `2 + k1 = 0  => k1 = -2`\n2.  `3 + k1 + k4 = 0  => 3 - 2 + k4 = 0  => k4 = -1`\n3.  `-1 + k1 + k3 = 0  => -1 - 2 + k3 = 0  => k3 = 3`\n4.  `k2 - 2k1 - 3 = 0  => k2 - 2(-2) - 3 = 0  => k2 + 4 - 3 = 0 => k2 = -1`\n\nSo, the state-feedback gain vector is `k = [-2, -1, 3, -1]`.\n\n**4. Determine the Observer Gain L**\n\nThe dual feedback gain matrix is `K_dual = [k; 0 0 0 0] = [-2 -1 3 -1; 0 0 0 0]`.\nThe observer gain `L` is the transpose of `K_dual`:\n`L = K_dual' = [-2 0; -1 0; 3 0; -1 0]`\n\nThis is the required observer gain matrix that places all observer poles at the origin, achieving a deadbeat response. The observation error will be zero in `nu=3` steps.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe gain matrix of the observer is:\n`L = [[-2, 0], [-1, 0], [3, 0], [-1, 0]]`\n\n<<<[[-2, 0], [-1, 0], [3, 0], [-1, 0]]>>>"
