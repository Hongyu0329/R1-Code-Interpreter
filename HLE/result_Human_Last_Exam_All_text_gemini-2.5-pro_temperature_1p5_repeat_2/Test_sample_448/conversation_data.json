    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rarest noble gas on Earth.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Noble Gases:** The elements known as noble gases are found in Group 18 of the periodic table. The naturally occurring ones on Earth are Helium (He), Neon (Ne), Argon (Ar), Krypton (Kr), Xenon (Xe), and Radon (Rn).\n\n2.  **Define the Scope:** The question asks for the rarest gas as a \"percentage of all terrestrial matter\" in 2002. \"Terrestrial matter\" refers to the substance of the planet Earth (crust, mantle, core, oceans, atmosphere). The abundances of these gases have not changed significantly in recent history, so the year 2002 does not change the answer. While the exact abundance varies depending on whether you are measuring the atmosphere, crust, or the entire planet, the relative order of rarity for the noble gases remains consistent for this question. We will primarily use atmospheric concentration, as this is where these gases are most present and their abundance is most commonly measured.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Stable Noble Gases:** Let's first compare the abundances of the non-radioactive (or very long-lived) noble gases, typically measured in parts per million (ppm) by volume in the atmosphere:\n    *   **Argon (Ar):** ~9,340 ppm (or 0.934%). It is the most abundant noble gas on Earth.\n    *   **Neon (Ne):** ~18.2 ppm.\n    *   **Helium (He):** ~5.2 ppm.\n    *   **Krypton (Kr):** ~1.1 ppm.\n    *   **Xenon (Xe):** ~0.09 ppm (or 90 parts per billion).\n    *   Based on this list, Xenon is the rarest among the stable noble gases.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Radioactive Noble Gas (Radon):**\n    *   **Origin:** Radon (Rn) is different from the other noble gases. It is not a primordial element from Earth's formation. Instead, it is continuously produced from the radioactive decay of uranium and thorium, which are found in trace amounts throughout the Earth's crust.\n    *   **Instability:** Radon is highly radioactive. Its most stable isotope, Radon-222, has a half-life of only about 3.8 days. This means that half of any given amount of radon will decay into other elements in less than four days.\n    *   **Abundance:** Because it decays so quickly, radon does not accumulate in the atmosphere or crust to any significant degree. Its concentration is extremely low and highly variable. The average concentration in the atmosphere is minuscule, on the order of one part per sextillion (1 in 10^21).\n\n5.  **Compare All Noble Gases:**\n    *   The abundance of the rarest stable noble gas, Xenon, is about 0.09 parts per million (9 x 10⁻⁸).\n    *   The abundance of Radon is about 1 part in 10²¹.\n    *   When comparing these values, it is clear that the concentration of Radon is many trillions of times lower than that of Xenon.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Primordial vs. Radiogenic:** It's important to distinguish between primordial gases (like Xenon, Krypton, Neon) that have been on Earth since its formation and radiogenic gases that are products of radioactive decay (like Radon, most Helium, and a large portion of Argon).\n*   **Stability and Half-Life:** The key to this question is the extreme instability and very short half-life of Radon. Even though it is constantly being produced, it decays so rapidly that its overall quantity at any moment is infinitesimal.\n*   **\"Terrestrial Matter\" Scope:** While we used atmospheric concentrations for comparison, the conclusion holds for all \"terrestrial matter.\" The total mass of Radon in the entire Earth system at any given time is exceptionally small compared to the total mass of Xenon.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nComparing all naturally occurring noble gases, Radon's extreme radioactivity and short half-life mean its steady-state concentration in the Earth's environment is far lower than any other noble gas. Therefore, it is the rarest.\n\n<<<Radon>>>"
