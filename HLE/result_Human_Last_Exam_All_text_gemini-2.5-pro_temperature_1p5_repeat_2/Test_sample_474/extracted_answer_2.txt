No, this approach is not fully valid. The ecological function of mimicry in bumblebees is to present a warning signal to their natural visual predators, primarily birds. The validity of the researcher's approach hinges on whether human perception is an adequate proxy for predator perception. It is not, due to a critical difference: bird vision is sensitive to ultraviolet (UV) light, whereas human vision is not. Two bee species could look identical to a human but have different UV patterns, making them easily distinguishable to a bird. Therefore, clusters based on human similarity rankings might not reflect the true mimicry rings that are functional in the wild, as they ignore a key sensory dimension used by the ecologically relevant signal receiver.
