    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Core Subject:** A specific philosophical concept.\n    *   **The Concept:** The decomposition of the notion of \"hallmark\" into \"symptoms\" and \"signals\".\n    *   **The Constraint:** The philosopher must belong to the Lviv-Warsaw School.\n\n2.  **Identify the Lviv-Warsaw School:**\n    *   This was a highly influential school of logic and analytic philosophy in Poland during the interwar period (1920s-1930s).\n    *   Its founder was Kazimierz Twardowski.\n    *   Key members include Jan Łukasiewicz, Stanisław Leśniewski, Alfred Tarski, Tadeusz Kotarbiński, and Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz.\n    *   The school is known for its emphasis on clarity, rigor, logical analysis, and anti-irrationalism. The question asks about one of these figures.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Philosophical Distinction:**\n    *   **Hallmark (or mark, sign):** This is the general category of something that indicates something else. The Polish term is often *znamię*.\n    *   **Symptom:** A natural sign. The relationship between the sign (symptom) and what it signifies is causal or based on a natural, objective connection. It is not created by human convention. For example, smoke is a symptom of fire; a fever is a symptom of an illness.\n    *   **Signal (or sign proper):** A conventional sign. The relationship between the sign (signal) and what it signifies is based on an agreement, rule, or convention established by a group. The connection is arbitrary. For example, a red traffic light is a signal to stop; the word \"cat\" is a signal for the concept of a cat.\n\n4.  **Connect the Distinction to a Philosopher of the Lviv-Warsaw School:**\n    *   We need to search through the works of the major figures of the school to find who made this specific analysis of signs.\n    *   While many members worked on language and meaning (like Ajdukiewicz and Tarski), this particular distinction is a well-known part of the epistemological and praxiological work of **Tadeusz Kotarbiński**.\n    *   Kotarbiński, in his works such as *Gnosiology: The Scientific Approach to the Theory of Knowledge* (originally published in Polish as *Elementy teorii poznania, logiki formalnej i metodologii nauk*), explicitly analyzes the concept of signs (*znaki*) or marks (*znamiona*). He breaks them down into these two fundamental types.\n\n5.  **Careful Points to Note:**\n    *   The terminology can vary slightly in translation. \"Signal\" is sometimes translated as \"sign proper\" or \"conventional sign\". \"Symptom\" is sometimes called an \"index\" or \"natural sign\". However, the symptom/signal distinction is the standard way to refer to Kotarbiński's classification.\n    *   This distinction was fundamental to Kotarbiński's broader philosophical project, including his theory of knowledge (epistemology) and his theory of efficient action (praxiology), as understanding the nature of indicators is crucial for both knowing and acting effectively.\n    *   It is important not to confuse this with other theories of signs, such as that of Charles Sanders Peirce (icon, index, symbol), although there are parallels (Peirce's \"index\" is similar to Kotarbiński's \"symptom,\" and Peirce's \"symbol\" is similar to Kotarbiński's \"signal\"). The question specifically asks for the Lviv-Warsaw School philosopher.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis, the philosopher from the Lviv-Warsaw School who introduced the distinction between symptoms (natural signs) and signals (conventional signs) as a decomposition of the broader notion of a hallmark or mark is Tadeusz Kotarbiński.\n\n<<<Tadeusz Kotarbiński>>>"
