    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Subject:** The question is about the poem *Sir Launfal*. Specifically, it refers to the Middle English romance poem attributed to Thomas Chestre, written in the late 14th century.\n2.  **Determine Preservation Context:** The phrase \"preserved alongside\" indicates that the poem was part of a single physical volume, a manuscript codex, which contained other works. Such collections, or miscellanies, were common in the medieval period.\n3.  **Identify the Manuscript:** The poem *Sir Launfal* by Thomas Chestre survives in only one manuscript. This manuscript is **British Library, Cotton Caligula A.ii**.\n4.  **Examine the Manuscript's Contents:** To find what it was \"preserved alongside,\" we need to know the other texts included in the Cotton Caligula A.ii manuscript. This manuscript is a famous collection of Middle English romances and other works.\n5.  **Locate the \"Book of Manners\":** By examining the contents list for this manuscript, we find several romances (like *Emar√©* and *Libeaus Desconus*) and, crucially, a poem on conduct and etiquette.\n6.  **Name the Book of Manners:** This specific work on etiquette included in the Cotton Caligula A.ii manuscript is known as **\"The Boke of Curtasye\"** (The Book of Courtesy). It is a poem that provides instruction on manners, particularly table manners, for young men serving in noble households.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n\n*   **Uniqueness of the Manuscript:** The fact that *Sir Launfal* survives in only one manuscript makes this question answerable with certainty. The answer is tied directly to the contents of that specific physical object.\n*   **Distinguishing Versions:** It's important to recognize that the question refers to the English poem by Thomas Chestre, not the earlier Anglo-Norman lay *Lanval* by Marie de France, which is preserved in different manuscripts with different accompanying texts.\n*   **Spelling Variation:** The name of the book of manners can be spelled in various ways, including \"The Boke of Curtasye,\" \"The Book of Courtesy,\" or \"The Book of Curtesye.\" All refer to the same text.\n\nBy following these steps, we can definitively identify the book of manners that was preserved in the same manuscript as *Sir Launfal*.\n\n<<<The Boke of Curtasye>>>"
