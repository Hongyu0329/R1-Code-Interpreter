    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the oligomeric state of the given protein sequence.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the principles of coiled-coil structures.**\nCoiled-coils are protein structural motifs where two or more alpha-helices are wound around each other to form a stable structure. Their stability comes from the hydrophobic effect, where nonpolar side chains are buried in the core of the structure, away from water. The sequence of a coiled-coil typically follows a seven-residue repeat, called a heptad repeat, denoted as **(abcdefg)n**. Residues at positions **'a'** and **'d'** are typically hydrophobic and form the interacting core between the helices. The specific amino acids at these positions dictate the number of helices that will assemble, i.e., the oligomeric state, through a packing mechanism known as \"knobs-into-holes\".\n\n**Step 2: Assign the heptad repeat to the given sequence.**\nThe sequence is: `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG`.\nWe need to find the correct `(abcdefg)` register that places hydrophobic residues (like L, I, V, A, W) consistently at the 'a' and 'd' positions. Let's test possible alignments.\n\n*   **Hypothesis 1:** Let's assume the first Isoleucine (`I` at position 3) is at the 'a' position.\n    *   `a b c d e f g`\n    *   `I A Q S L K E`\n    *   This puts `I` (hydrophobic) at 'a' but `S` (Serine, polar) at 'd'. A polar residue in the core is highly unfavorable. This alignment is incorrect.\n\n*   **Hypothesis 2:** Let's assume the first Isoleucine (`I` at position 3) is at the 'd' position.\n    *   `d e f g a b c`\n    *   `I A Q S L K E`\n    *   This puts `I` (Isoleucine, hydrophobic) at 'd' and `L` (Leucine, hydrophobic) at 'a'. This is a very plausible hydrophobic core.\n\nLet's apply this successful register to the entire sequence:\n\nSequence: `G E I A Q S L K E I A K S L K E I A W S L K E I A Q S L K G`\nRegister: `      d e f g a b c d e f g a b c d e f g a b c d e f g a b c`\n\nNow, let's list the residues at the core 'a' and 'd' positions:\n*   **'a' positions:** L (at residue 7), L (at 14), L (at 21), L (at 28).\n*   **'d' positions:** I (at residue 3), I (at 10), I (at 17), I (at 24).\n\nThe analysis reveals a very consistent pattern: all 'a' positions are Leucine (L) and all 'd' positions are Isoleucine (I). The Tryptophan (`W`) is at position 19, which corresponds to an 'f' position, placing it on the solvent-exposed surface where it doesn't interfere with the core packing.\n\n**Step 3: Predict the oligomeric state based on the core residues.**\nThe identity of residues at 'a' and 'd' positions strongly predicts the oligomeric state due to packing efficiency (the \"knobs-into-holes\" model).\n\n*   **Dimer (2 helices):** Typically favored by β-branched amino acids (Isoleucine or Valine) at the 'a' position and Leucine at the 'd' position. The sequence `(a=L, d=I)` is the opposite of this, making a dimer unlikely.\n*   **Trimer (3 helices):** Often formed when Leucine is at both 'a' and 'd' positions. While trimers with `(a=L, d=I)` exist, it's not the classic pattern.\n*   **Tetramer (4 helices):** The canonical and most stable pattern for a parallel tetramer is having Leucine (L) at the 'a' position and a β-branched amino acid like Isoleucine (I) or Valine (V) at the 'd' position. This creates a highly efficient and specific packing arrangement in the hydrophobic core.\n\nThe sequence in question, with Leucine consistently at the 'a' position and Isoleucine consistently at the 'd' position, perfectly matches the established rule for forming a **tetramer**.\n\n*   **Higher-order oligomers (5, 6, etc.):** These are less common and typically require more complex sequence patterns, sometimes involving polar residues within the core. The simple, canonical `(a=L, d=I)` pattern does not suggest these states.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe sequence analysis shows a consistent heptad repeat with Leucine at all 'a' positions and Isoleucine at all 'd' positions. Based on well-established principles of coiled-coil packing efficiency, this specific pattern is a strong predictor of a tetrameric (4-helix) oligomeric state.\n\n<<<C>>>"
