    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine what the Modern English word for \"sister\" would be without Norse influence.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the original words:**\n    *   The Modern English word is \"sister\".\n    *   The ancestor of this word in Old English (the language of the Anglo-Saxons) was *sweostor*.\n    *   The cognate word in Old Norse (the language of the Vikings) was *systir*.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Norse Influence:**\n    *   When the Norse settled in England, their language heavily influenced the development of English.\n    *   The Old English word *sweostor* and the Old Norse word *systir* both derive from the same Proto-Germanic root (*swestēr). Because they were so similar, they blended.\n    *   The modern form \"sister\" is not a direct phonetic descendant of the Old English *sweostor*. The pronunciation, particularly the 'i' vowel and the hard 's' sound, was reinforced and shaped by the Old Norse *systir*.\n\n3.  **Trace the hypothetical native English development:**\n    *   If there had been no Norse invasion, the Old English word *sweostor* would have evolved naturally according to English sound change rules.\n    *   By the early Middle English period, *sweostor* was already becoming simplified in some dialects to forms like *swuster* or *suster*. The form *suster* is well-attested in Middle English texts that show less Norse influence.\n\n4.  **Project the form into Modern English:**\n    *   Let's take the Middle English form *suster* as our starting point, as this represents a common, natural development from Old English *sweostor*.\n    *   We need to apply the subsequent major sound changes, most notably the Great Vowel Shift and other later developments.\n    *   The vowel 'u' in *suster* was pronounced /ʊ/ (like the vowel in \"put\").\n    *   During a development called the \"foot-strut split\" in the 16th-17th centuries, this /ʊ/ sound in many words shifted to /ʌ/ (the vowel sound in \"strut\" or \"cup\"). This is the same change that turned Middle English *sunne* into \"sun\" and *lufu* into \"love\".\n    *   Applying this change to *suster* (/ˈsʊstər/) would result in a word pronounced /ˈsʌstər/.\n    *   The spelling would most likely have remained as \"suster\".\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Precedent for Simplification:** The simplification of Old English *sweostor* to *suster* (losing the 'w') is not unusual. A similar process happened to the word *sword* (from Old English *sweord*) and *answer* (from Old English *andswaru*), where the 'w' is no longer pronounced.\n*   **Cognates in other languages:** The word for \"sister\" in Dutch, another West Germanic language that did not undergo heavy Norse influence, is *zuster*, which closely matches the hypothetical English development.\n*   **Conclusion:** The native, uninfluenced evolution of Old English *sweostor* would almost certainly have resulted in the word *suster*. The form *sister* as we know it is a direct consequence of the linguistic interaction between the Anglo-Saxons and Norse invaders.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nBased on the natural phonological development of the Old English word *sweostor* without the influence of the Old Norse *systir*, the Modern English word would most likely be **Suster**.\n\n<<<Suster>>>"
