    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the algorithm's computational time complexity.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core of the Algorithm:**\n    The algorithm's runtime is dominated by the `while` loop (Step 2). The initialization (Step 1) involves a constant number of operations. The return statement (Step 3) depends on the number of digits found, which is determined by the loop's execution. Therefore, analyzing the `while` loop is key to finding the overall complexity.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Loop's Control Flow:**\n    The `while` loop continues as long as the condition `q > 0` is true. We need to determine how many times the loop body executes before `q` becomes 0.\n\n3.  **Trace the Controlling Variable `q`:**\n    The variable `q` represents the quotient. Let's see how its value changes over time.\n    *   **Before the loop:** `q` is initialized to `q_initial = ⌊n/c⌋`.\n    *   **After 1st iteration:** Inside the loop, `x` is set to the previous quotient (`q_initial`). The new quotient `q` becomes `q_1 = ⌊x/c⌋ = ⌊(⌊n/c⌋)/c⌋`. By the properties of the floor function, this is equal to `⌊n/c²⌋`.\n    *   **After 2nd iteration:** The next `q` becomes `q_2 = ⌊(⌊n/c²⌋)/c⌋ = ⌊n/c³⌋`.\n    *   **After `k` iterations:** The value of `q` will be `q_k = ⌊n/c^(k+1)⌋`.\n\n4.  **Determine the Number of Loop Iterations:**\n    The loop terminates when `q` is no longer greater than 0. Since `n` and `c` are positive, this happens when `q` becomes exactly 0.\n    The condition `q_k = 0` is met when `n/c^(k+1) < 1`.\n    Rearranging the inequality, we get `n < c^(k+1)`.\n    To find the number of iterations `k`, we can take the logarithm with base `c` of both sides:\n    `log_c(n) < k+1`\n    The number of times the loop executes, `k`, is the number of digits in the base-c representation of `n` minus one. This number is precisely `⌊log_c(n)⌋`. Therefore, the number of loop iterations is proportional to `log_c(n)`.\n\n5.  **Analyze the Work Done Inside the Loop:**\n    Each iteration of the `while` loop (Step 2.1) performs a fixed number of elementary operations:\n    *   `i := i + 1`: one addition.\n    *   `x := q`: one assignment.\n    *   `q := ⌊x/c⌋`: one division and one floor operation.\n    *   `a_i := x - qc`: one multiplication and one subtraction.\n\n    Under the **uniform cost model**, where we assume that basic arithmetic operations on integers take constant time (`O(1)`), the cost of executing the loop body once is `O(1)`. This is a standard assumption in introductory algorithm analysis.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Total Time Complexity:**\n    The total time complexity is the product of the number of loop iterations and the time spent per iteration.\n    *   Total Time = (Number of Iterations) × (Time per Iteration)\n    *   T(n, c) = O(log_c(n)) × O(1)\n    *   T(n, c) = O(log_c(n))\n\n7.  **Final Simplification:**\n    The complexity is `O(log_c(n))`. Using the change of base formula for logarithms, we can express this in any base, for example, base 2: `log_c(n) = log₂(n) / log₂(c)`.\n    Since `c` is a constant input where `c ≥ 2`, `log₂(c)` is also a positive constant. In Big-O notation, we can ignore constant factors. Therefore, the complexity can be simplified. The worst-case runtime occurs when `c` is at its minimum (`c=2`), which maximizes the `log_c(n)` term.\n    The complexity is thus commonly expressed as:\n    **T(n) = O(log n)**\n\n---\n### List of Careful Points\n\n1.  **Complexity Model:** The primary consideration is the cost model for arithmetic operations. The analysis above uses the **uniform cost model** (`O(1)` per operation), which is standard for such problems. A more detailed **logarithmic cost model** (bit complexity) would consider the increasing size of numbers and yield `O((log n)²)`, but this is typically reserved for analyses where arbitrary-precision arithmetic is the main focus.\n2.  **Dependence on `c`:** The exact number of iterations depends on the base `c`. The complexity `O(log_c n)` shows this dependency. However, in Big-O notation, it's common to provide a simplified expression that captures the growth rate with respect to the main input parameter `n`, and `O(log n)` serves as a correct upper bound for any `c ≥ 2`.\n3.  **Input Parameter:** The complexity is a function of the *value* of the input `n`, not its size in memory. If we were to express the complexity in terms of the number of bits in `n`, let's say `k = O(log n)`, the complexity would be `O(k)`, i.e., linear in the size of the input.\n\n---\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the standard analysis method, the computational time complexity of the algorithm is determined by the number of divisions performed, which is logarithmic with respect to the input value `n`.\n\n<<<O(log n)>>>"
