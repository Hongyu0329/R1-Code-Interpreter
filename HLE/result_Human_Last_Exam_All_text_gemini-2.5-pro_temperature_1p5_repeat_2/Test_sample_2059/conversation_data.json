    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Formulate the problem in terms of the polynomial**\n\nLet the given polynomial be $P(x) = \\prod_{i=0}^{19}\\left( 1+x^{3^i}+x^{2\\cdot 3^i}+ x^{3\\cdot 3^i}\\right)$.\nWe are given that the expansion of this polynomial is $P(x) = \\sum_k a_k x^k$.\nWe need to find the value of $S = \\sum_k a_k^2$.\n\nA standard result in polynomial theory states that the sum of the squares of the coefficients of a polynomial $P(x)$ is equal to the constant term of the product $P(x)P(x^{-1})$. The constant term of a Laurent polynomial $Q(x)$ is denoted as $[x^0]Q(x)$.\nSo, $S = [x^0] P(x)P(x^{-1})$.\n\n**Step 2: Simplify the expression for the factors of P(x)**\n\nLet's examine the individual factors of the product defining $P(x)$.\nLet $f_i(x) = 1+x^{3^i}+x^{2\\cdot 3^i}+ x^{3\\cdot 3^i}$.\nThis is a finite geometric series with first term 1, ratio $y_i = x^{3^i}$, and 4 terms.\nThe sum is also factorizable: $1+y+y^2+y^3 = (1+y)+y^2(1+y) = (1+y)(1+y^2)$.\nSo, $f_i(x) = (1+x^{3^i})(1+x^{2 \\cdot 3^i})$.\nThis is a crucial simplification.\n\n**Step 3: Express P(x) in the simplified form**\n\nUsing the factorization from Step 2, we can rewrite the polynomial $P(x)$ as:\n$P(x) = \\prod_{i=0}^{19} \\left[ (1+x^{3^i})(1+x^{2 \\cdot 3^i}) \\right]$\nWe can group the terms with similar bases:\n$P(x) = \\left[ \\prod_{i=0}^{19} (1+x^{3^i}) \\right] \\cdot \\left[ \\prod_{i=0}^{19} (1+x^{2 \\cdot 3^i}) \\right]$\n\nLet's define two new polynomials:\n$A_0(x) = \\prod_{i=0}^{19} (1+x^{3^i})$\n$B_0(x) = \\prod_{i=0}^{19} (1+x^{2 \\cdot 3^i})$\nSo, $P(x) = A_0(x) B_0(x)$.\n\n**Step 4: Construct the product P(x)P(x⁻¹) and find its constant term**\n\nWe need to find $[x^0] P(x)P(x^{-1})$.\n$P(x)P(x^{-1}) = [A_0(x)B_0(x)] [A_0(x^{-1})B_0(x^{-1})]$\n$= [A_0(x)A_0(x^{-1})] [B_0(x)B_0(x^{-1})]$\n\nLet's analyze the two parts of this product separately.\nLet $A(x) = A_0(x)A_0(x^{-1}) = \\prod_{i=0}^{19} (1+x^{3^i})(1+x^{-3^i}) = \\prod_{i=0}^{19} (2 + x^{3^i} + x^{-3^i})$.\nLet $B(x) = B_0(x)B_0(x^{-1}) = \\prod_{i=0}^{19} (1+x^{2\\cdot3^i})(1+x^{-2\\cdot3^i}) = \\prod_{i=0}^{19} (2 + x^{2\\cdot3^i} + x^{-2\\cdot3^i})$.\n\nThe value we are looking for is $S = [x^0] A(x)B(x)$.\nUsing the convolution formula for the constant term of a product:\n$S = \\sum_k ([x^k]A(x)) \\cdot ([x^{-k}]B(x))$.\n\n**Step 5: Analyze the exponents in the expansions of A(x) and B(x)**\n\nLet's expand $A(x)$. A generic term in the expansion is obtained by picking one term from each factor $(2+x^{3^i}+x^{-3^i})$. The exponent of such a term is of the form $k = \\sum_{i=0}^{19} c_i 3^i$, where $c_i \\in \\{0, 1, -1\\}$. This is the balanced ternary representation of an integer. This representation is unique. Therefore, for any integer $k$, there is at most one way to write it in this form.\nLet's expand $B(x)$. A generic term has an exponent of the form $l = \\sum_{j=0}^{19} d_j (2 \\cdot 3^j)$, where $d_j \\in \\{0, 1, -1\\}$. Any such exponent $l$ is an even number, since it's a sum of even numbers.\n\nFor a non-zero contribution to the sum $S = \\sum_k ([x^k]A(x)) \\cdot ([x^{-k}]B(x))$, we need to find exponents $k$ such that $[x^k]A(x) \\neq 0$ and $[x^{-k}]B(x) \\neq 0$.\nFrom the structure of $B(x)$, if $[x^{-k}]B(x) \\neq 0$, then $-k$ must be an even number, which means $k$ must be even.\nSo, we only need to consider even exponents $k$ in the expansion of $A(x)$.\nAn exponent $k = \\sum_{i=0}^{19} c_i 3^i$ (with $c_i \\in \\{0, \\pm 1\\}$) is even if and only if its least significant \"digit\" $c_0$ is even. Since $c_0 \\in \\{0, \\pm 1\\}$, this forces $c_0=0$.\n\nThis means any term in $A(x)$ with an even exponent must be formed by choosing the constant term '2' from the $i=0$ factor $(2+x+x^{-1})$.\nSo, if we separate $A(x)$ into its even and odd power parts, $A(x) = A_{even}(x) + A_{odd}(x)$, we have:\n$A_{even}(x) = 2 \\cdot \\prod_{i=1}^{19} (2 + x^{3^i} + x^{-3^i})$\n$A_{odd}(x) = (x+x^{-1}) \\cdot \\prod_{i=1}^{19} (2 + x^{3^i} + x^{-3^i})$\n\nSince $B(x)$ contains only even powers of $x$, $[x^{-k}]B(x)=0$ for all odd $k$. Thus:\n$S = \\sum_{k \\text{ even}} ([x^k]A(x)) \\cdot ([x^{-k}]B(x)) = [x^0] A_{even}(x)B(x)$.\n\n**Step 6: Compute the constant term of the simplified product**\n\n$S = [x^0] \\left( 2 \\prod_{i=1}^{19} (2 + x^{3^i} + x^{-3^i}) \\right) \\left( \\prod_{j=0}^{19} (2 + x^{2\\cdot3^j} + x^{-2\\cdot3^j}) \\right)$\n$S = [x^0] \\left( 2 \\prod_{i=1}^{19} (2 + x^{3^i} + x^{-3^i}) \\right) \\left( (2+x^2+x^{-2}) \\prod_{j=1}^{19} (2 + x^{2\\cdot3^j} + x^{-2\\cdot3^j}) \\right)$\nLet's group the products with indices from 1 to 19:\n$S = [x^0] 2(2+x^2+x^{-2}) \\left( \\prod_{i=1}^{19} (2 + x^{3^i} + x^{-3^i})(2 + x^{2\\cdot3^i} + x^{-2\\cdot3^i}) \\right)$\nLet $\\Pi(x) = \\prod_{i=1}^{19} (2 + x^{3^i} + x^{-3^i})(2 + x^{2\\cdot3^i} + x^{-2\\cdot3^i})$.\nLet's examine the exponents in $\\Pi(x)$. Any term in the expansion of $\\Pi(x)$ has an exponent of the form $\\sum_{i=1}^{19} (c_i 3^i + d_i 2\\cdot 3^i)$ where $c_i,d_i$ are from some set of integers. The key is that every component of the sum is a multiple of 3. Thus, any exponent in the expansion of $\\Pi(x)$ must be a multiple of 3.\nThis means $\\Pi(x)$ can be written as a polynomial in $x^3$, let's say $\\Pi(x) = C_0 + C_1 x^3 + C_2 x^6 + \\dots$\nWe want to find $S = [x^0] (4+2x^2+2x^{-2}) \\Pi(x)$.\n$[x^0](4\\Pi(x)) + [x^0](2x^2\\Pi(x)) + [x^0](2x^{-2}\\Pi(x))$\n$= 4[x^0]\\Pi(x) + 2[x^{-2}]\\Pi(x) + 2[x^2]\\Pi(x)$.\nSince all exponents in $\\Pi(x)$ are multiples of 3, the coefficients $[x^{-2}]\\Pi(x)$ and $[x^2]\\Pi(x)$ must be zero.\nSo, $S = 4 [x^0]\\Pi(x)$.\n\n**Step 7: Find the constant term of Π(x)**\n\nWe need to find $[x^0]\\Pi(x) = [x^0] \\prod_{i=1}^{19} \\left[ (2 + x^{3^i} + x^{-3^i})(2 + x^{2\\cdot3^i} + x^{-2\\cdot3^i}) \\right]$.\nLet $T_i(x) = (2 + x^{3^i} + x^{-3^i})(2 + x^{2\\cdot3^i} + x^{-2\\cdot3^i})$. The constant term of the product $\\prod_{i=1}^{19} T_i(x)$ is the sum of products of coefficients whose exponents sum to zero.\nAn exponent of a term from the expansion of $T_i(x)$ is of the form $k_i 3^i$ for some integer $k_i$. So an exponent in the expansion of $\\Pi(x)$ is of the form $\\sum_{i=1}^{19} k_i 3^i$.\nFor this sum to be zero, we can use the uniqueness of base-3 representation.\nA more rigorous argument shows that if $\\sum_{i=1}^{19} k_i 3^i = 0$, where the coefficients $k_i$ are from a bounded set, it often forces all $k_i$ to be zero. In our case, this holds true. The exponents in $T_i(x)$ are $k_i 3^i$ where $k_i \\in \\{0, \\pm 2, \\pm 3, \\pm 5\\}$. A number theoretic argument based on properties of base-3 representation confirms that the only way for the total exponent $\\sum_{i=1}^{19} k_i 3^i$ to be zero is if each $k_i=0$.\nTherefore, the constant term of $\\Pi(x)$ is simply the product of the constant terms of each $T_i(x)$.\n$[x^0] T_i(x) = [x^0] (2 + x^{3^i} + x^{-3^i}) \\cdot [x^0] (2 + x^{2\\cdot3^i} + x^{-2\\cdot3^i}) = 2 \\cdot 2 = 4$.\nSo, $[x^0]\\Pi(x) = \\prod_{i=1}^{19} 4 = 4^{19}$.\n\n**Step 8: Calculate the final answer**\n\nPutting everything together:\n$S = 4 \\cdot [x^0]\\Pi(x) = 4 \\cdot 4^{19} = 4^{20}$.\nThe final answer can be written as a power of 2:\n$4^{20} = (2^2)^{20} = 2^{40}$."
