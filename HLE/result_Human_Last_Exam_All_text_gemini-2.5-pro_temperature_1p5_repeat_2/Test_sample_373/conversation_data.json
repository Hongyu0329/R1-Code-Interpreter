    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the probability of sampling the bottleneck edge in a 10-node barbell graph during randomized uniform gossiping.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Barbell Graph Structure**\nA barbell graph is constructed by connecting two identical complete graphs (cliques) with a single edge (a bridge).\n*   **Total Nodes (N):** 10\n*   This means the graph consists of two complete graphs of 5 nodes each (K_5). Let's call them Clique A and Clique B.\n*   **Bottleneck Edge:** A single edge connects one node from Clique A to one node from Clique B. Let's call the nodes connected by this edge `u` (in Clique A) and `v` (in Clique B). This edge, `(u, v)`, is the bottleneck.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Degree of Each Node**\nThe degree of a node is the number of edges connected to it. We need to calculate the degrees for two types of nodes:\n*   **Bridgehead Nodes (`u` and `v`):** These are the two nodes connected by the bottleneck edge.\n    *   Each is part of a K_5, so it is connected to the other 4 nodes within its own clique.\n    *   Additionally, each is connected to the other bridgehead node via the bottleneck edge.\n    *   Therefore, the degree of `u` is `d(u) = 4 (internal to clique) + 1 (bottleneck) = 5`.\n    *   Similarly, the degree of `v` is `d(v) = 4 + 1 = 5`.\n    *   There are **2** nodes with degree 5.\n*   **Internal Clique Nodes:** These are all other nodes in the graph.\n    *   There are 4 such nodes in Clique A and 4 in Clique B.\n    *   Each of these nodes is only connected to the other 4 nodes within its own K_5 clique.\n    *   Therefore, their degree is 4.\n    *   There are **8** nodes with degree 4.\n\n**Step 3: Model the Uniform Gossiping Process**\nRandomized uniform gossiping is a two-stage sampling process for selecting an edge to communicate over:\n1.  A node `i` is selected uniformly at random from the set of all `N` nodes. The probability of selecting any specific node is `1/N`. In this case, `P(select node i) = 1/10`.\n2.  The selected node `i` then chooses one of its neighbors `j` to contact, uniformly at random. The probability of choosing a specific neighbor `j` is `1/d(i)`, where `d(i)` is the degree of node `i`.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Probability of Sampling the Bottleneck Edge**\nThe bottleneck edge `(u, v)` is sampled if one of two mutually exclusive events occurs:\n*   **Event 1:** Node `u` is chosen in the first step, and it then chooses node `v` as its neighbor.\n*   **Event 2:** Node `v` is chosen in the first step, and it then chooses node `u` as its neighbor.\n\nLet's calculate the probability of each event:\n*   **P(Event 1) = P(node `u` is selected) * P(`u` chooses `v`)**\n    *   P(node `u` is selected) = `1/N = 1/10`\n    *   P(`u` chooses `v`) = `1/d(u) = 1/5`\n    *   P(Event 1) = `(1/10) * (1/5) = 1/50`\n\n*   **P(Event 2) = P(node `v` is selected) * P(`v` chooses `u`)**\n    *   P(node `v` is selected) = `1/N = 1/10`\n    *   P(`v` chooses `u`) = `1/d(v) = 1/5`\n    *   P(Event 2) = `(1/10) * (1/5) = 1/50`\n\nThe total probability of sampling the bottleneck edge is the sum of the probabilities of these two events.\n*   **P(sampling bottleneck) = P(Event 1) + P(Event 2)**\n*   P(sampling bottleneck) = `1/50 + 1/50 = 2/50 = 1/25`\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n*   **Graph Structure:** Correctly identifying that a 10-node barbell graph is formed by two 5-node cliques is the first crucial step.\n*   **Node Degrees:** Miscalculating the degrees, especially of the bridgehead nodes, would lead to an incorrect answer. It's important to remember they have connections both inside their clique and across the bridge.\n*   **Gossiping Model:** The most critical point is understanding that \"uniform gossiping\" refers to the node-centric sampling model described above. It is not equivalent to picking an edge uniformly from all edges in the graph. If it were, the answer would be 1 divided by the total number of edges (which is 21), yielding a different result of 1/21.\n*   **Symmetry:** The calculation can be initiated from either side of the bottleneck edge (`u` to `v` or `v` to `u`), and both possibilities must be included in the final probability.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe probability of sampling the bottleneck edge is **1/25**.\n\n<<<1/25>>>"
