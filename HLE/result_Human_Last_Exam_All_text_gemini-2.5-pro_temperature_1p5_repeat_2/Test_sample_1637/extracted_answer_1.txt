Yes, modifying the probe to incorporate more polyethylene glycol (PEG) units is a very effective strategy for increasing its aqueous solubility and will likely solve the precipitation problem. The addition of hydrophilic PEG chains would counteract the hydrophobicity of the thioxanthenone core and the chlorohexyl tail, preventing the probe from crashing out of the cell culture medium. However, it is important to note that this modification may alter other properties of the probe, such as its ability to cross the cell membrane.
