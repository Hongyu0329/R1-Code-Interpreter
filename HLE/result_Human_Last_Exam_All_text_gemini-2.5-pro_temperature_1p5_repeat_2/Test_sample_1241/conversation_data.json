    "The user wants to find the value of $P_{0}(+\\infty) + P_{1}(+\\infty)$ for a given system of differential equations. This is a problem about finding the steady-state probabilities of a continuous-time Markov chain.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understanding the Problem**\nThe given system is a set of Kolmogorov-Chapman forward equations for a continuous-time Markov chain with four states {0, 1, 2, 3}. The functions $P_i(t)$ represent the probability of the system being in state $i$ at time $t$. The question asks for the sum of probabilities of being in state 0 and state 1 as time approaches infinity, i.e., in the steady state. Let's denote the steady-state probabilities as $\\pi_i = P_i(+\\infty) = \\lim_{t\\to\\infty} P_i(t)$.\n\n**2. Setting up the Steady-State Equations**\nIn the steady state, the probabilities are constant, so their derivatives with respect to time are zero. We set $P_i'(t) = 0$ for all $i = 0, 1, 2, 3$. This transforms the system of differential equations into a system of linear algebraic equations, also known as the balance equations.\n\nThe system of equations becomes:\n1.  $0 = -\\lambda_{01}\\pi_{0} + \\lambda_{10}\\pi_{1}$\n2.  $0 = \\lambda_{01}\\pi_{0} - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12})\\pi_{1} + \\lambda_{21}\\pi_{2} + \\lambda_{31}\\pi_{3}$\n3.  $0 = \\lambda_{12}\\pi_{1} - (\\lambda_{21} + \\lambda_{23})\\pi_{2}$\n4.  $0 = \\lambda_{23}\\pi_{2} - \\lambda_{31}\\pi_{3}$\n\nAdditionally, the probabilities must always sum to one, which gives us the normalization equation:\n5.  $\\pi_{0} + \\pi_{1} + \\pi_{2} + \\pi_{3} = 1$\n\n**3. Substituting the Given Values**\nWe substitute the given transition rates into the equations:\n$\\lambda_{01} = 0.019$\n$\\lambda_{10} = 0.65$\n$\\lambda_{12} = 0.4$\n$\\lambda_{21} = 0.392$\n$\\lambda_{23} = 0.008$\n$\\lambda_{31} = 0.008$\n\nThe system of equations is now:\n1.  $0 = -0.019 \\pi_0 + 0.65 \\pi_1$\n2.  (This equation is redundant, as it is the negative sum of the other three balance equations)\n3.  $0 = 0.4 \\pi_1 - (0.392 + 0.008) \\pi_2 \\implies 0 = 0.4 \\pi_1 - 0.4 \\pi_2$\n4.  $0 = 0.008 \\pi_2 - 0.008 \\pi_3$\n5.  $\\pi_0 + \\pi_1 + \\pi_2 + \\pi_3 = 1$\n\n**4. Solving the System of Equations**\nWe solve this system to find the relationships between the probabilities.\n\nFrom equation (4):\n$0.008 \\pi_2 = 0.008 \\pi_3 \\implies \\pi_2 = \\pi_3$\n\nFrom equation (3):\n$0.4 \\pi_1 = 0.4 \\pi_2 \\implies \\pi_1 = \\pi_2$\nCombining these results, we get a simple relationship: $\\pi_1 = \\pi_2 = \\pi_3$.\n\nFrom equation (1):\n$0.019 \\pi_0 = 0.65 \\pi_1 \\implies \\pi_0 = \\frac{0.65}{0.019} \\pi_1$.\n\nNow, we have expressed $\\pi_0, \\pi_2, \\pi_3$ in terms of $\\pi_1$. We can use the normalization equation (5) to solve for $\\pi_1$.\n$\\pi_0 + \\pi_1 + \\pi_2 + \\pi_3 = 1$\nSubstituting the relations we found:\n$\\left(\\frac{0.65}{0.019}\\right) \\pi_1 + \\pi_1 + \\pi_1 + \\pi_1 = 1$\n\nCombining the terms with $\\pi_1$:\n$\\left(\\frac{0.65}{0.019} + 3\\right) \\pi_1 = 1$\n$\\left(\\frac{0.65 + 3 \\times 0.019}{0.019}\\right) \\pi_1 = 1$\n$\\left(\\frac{0.65 + 0.057}{0.019}\\right) \\pi_1 = 1$\n$\\left(\\frac{0.707}{0.019}\\right) \\pi_1 = 1$\n\nSolving for $\\pi_1$:\n$\\pi_1 = \\frac{0.019}{0.707}$\n\n**5. Calculating the Final Answer**\nThe goal is to find $P_{0}(+\\infty) + P_{1}(+\\infty) = \\pi_0 + \\pi_1$.\nFirst, we find $\\pi_0$ using the value of $\\pi_1$:\n$\\pi_0 = \\frac{0.65}{0.019} \\pi_1 = \\frac{0.65}{0.019} \\times \\frac{0.019}{0.707} = \\frac{0.65}{0.707}$\n\nNow, we calculate the required sum:\n$\\pi_0 + \\pi_1 = \\frac{0.65}{0.707} + \\frac{0.019}{0.707}$\n$\\pi_0 + \\pi_1 = \\frac{0.65 + 0.019}{0.707}$\n$\\pi_0 + \\pi_1 = \\frac{0.669}{0.707}$\n\nFinally, we compute the numerical value:\n$\\frac{0.669}{0.707} \\approx 0.946251768...$\n\n### Careful Points\n1.  **Correct Model Identification**: The problem is about finding the steady-state (or equilibrium/stationary) distribution of a continuous-time Markov chain.\n2.  **Setting up Balance Equations**: The key step is to set the time derivatives of the probabilities to zero ($P_i'(t) = 0$) to find the steady-state probabilities $\\pi_i$.\n3.  **Linear Dependence**: The system of balance equations derived from setting derivatives to zero is always linearly dependent. One equation can be derived from the others. This is why the normalization condition $\\sum \\pi_i = 1$ is essential for finding a unique solution.\n4.  **Careful Arithmetic**: The numerical values of the rates involve decimals. Performing the calculations carefully is crucial. It's often helpful to keep expressions in fractional or symbolic form as long as possible to avoid premature rounding errors. For instance, noticing that $\\lambda_{12} = \\lambda_{21}+\\lambda_{23}$ and $\\lambda_{23}=\\lambda_{31}$ leads to the simplification $\\pi_1=\\pi_2=\\pi_3$.\n5.  **Final Calculation**: Ensure that the quantity being asked for is the one being calculated. The question asks for $\\pi_0 + \\pi_1$, not the individual probabilities.\n\nFollowing these steps and points leads to the final answer.\n\n<<<0.946251768>>>"
