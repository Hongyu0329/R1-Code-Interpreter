    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the probability of finding a particle in a specific interval within a 1D box.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Define the System and the State**\n*   The system is a particle confined to a one-dimensional box of length `a`, with potential walls at `x=0` and `x=a`.\n*   The particle is in the `n=2` energy state (the first excited state).\n\n**2. Write the Normalized Wavefunction**\n*   The general normalized wavefunction for a particle in a 1D box is:\n    $ψ_n(x) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{a}} \\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{a}\\right)$\n*   For the `n=2` state, the specific wavefunction is:\n    $ψ_2(x) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{a}} \\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x}{a}\\right)$\n\n**3. Define the Probability Density**\n*   The probability of finding the particle at a given position `x` is described by the probability density function, which is the square of the magnitude of the wavefunction, `|ψ_n(x)|^2`.\n*   For `n=2`, the probability density is:\n    $P(x) = |ψ_2(x)|^2 = \\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{a}} \\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x}{a}\\right)\\right)^2 = \\frac{2}{a} \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x}{a}\\right)$\n\n**4. Set Up the Probability Integral**\n*   The probability `P` of finding the particle in the interval from `x_1 = 0.495a` to `x_2 = 0.505a` is given by the integral of the probability density over this interval:\n    $P = \\int_{0.495a}^{0.505a} \\frac{2}{a} \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x}{a}\\right) dx$\n\n**5. Simplify the Integrand**\n*   To solve the integral, we use the trigonometric power-reduction identity: $\\sin^2(\\theta) = \\frac{1 - \\cos(2\\theta)}{2}$.\n*   In our case, $\\theta = \\frac{2\\pi x}{a}$, so $2\\theta = \\frac{4\\pi x}{a}$.\n*   Substituting this into the integral gives:\n    $P = \\int_{0.495a}^{0.505a} \\frac{2}{a} \\left(\\frac{1 - \\cos\\left(\\frac{4\\pi x}{a}\\right)}{2}\\right) dx = \\frac{1}{a} \\int_{0.495a}^{0.505a} \\left(1 - \\cos\\left(\\frac{4\\pi x}{a}\\right)\\right) dx$\n\n**6. Perform the Integration**\n*   We integrate the simplified expression term by term:\n    $P = \\frac{1}{a} \\left[ x - \\frac{a}{4\\pi} \\sin\\left(\\frac{4\\pi x}{a}\\right) \\right]_{0.495a}^{0.505a}$\n\n**7. Evaluate the Definite Integral**\n*   Now, we substitute the limits of integration:\n    $P = \\frac{1}{a} \\left\\{ \\left(0.505a - \\frac{a}{4\\pi} \\sin\\left(\\frac{4\\pi (0.505a)}{a}\\right)\\right) - \\left(0.495a - \\frac{a}{4\\pi} \\sin\\left(\\frac{4\\pi (0.495a)}{a}\\right)\\right) \\right\\}$\n*   Group the terms:\n    $P = \\frac{1}{a} \\left\\{ (0.505a - 0.495a) - \\frac{a}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\sin(2.02\\pi) - \\sin(1.98\\pi) \\right] \\right\\}$\n*   Simplify the expression:\n    $P = 0.01 - \\frac{1}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\sin(2\\pi + 0.02\\pi) - \\sin(2\\pi - 0.02\\pi) \\right]$\n    Using trigonometric identities $\\sin(2\\pi + \\phi) = \\sin(\\phi)$ and $\\sin(2\\pi - \\phi) = -\\sin(\\phi)$:\n    $P = 0.01 - \\frac{1}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\sin(0.02\\pi) - (-\\sin(0.02\\pi)) \\right]$\n    $P = 0.01 - \\frac{2\\sin(0.02\\pi)}{4\\pi} = 0.01 - \\frac{\\sin(0.02\\pi)}{2\\pi}$\n\n**8. Approximate for a Small Interval (or Use a Taylor Expansion)**\n*   The interval `[0.495a, 0.505a]` is centered on `x = 0.5a`, which is a node for the `n=2` state (i.e., the wavefunction and probability density are zero at this point). The probability is expected to be very small.\n*   Because the interval is very narrow, we can use an approximation. Let's make a change of variables, `y = x - 0.5a`. The integration is then from `y = -0.005a` to `y = +0.005a`.\n    The probability density becomes: $P(y) = \\frac{2}{a}\\sin^2\\left(\\frac{2\\pi(0.5a+y)}{a}\\right) = \\frac{2}{a}\\sin^2\\left(\\pi + \\frac{2\\pi y}{a}\\right) = \\frac{2}{a}\\sin^2\\left(\\frac{2\\pi y}{a}\\right)$.\n*   For small values of `y`, the argument of the sine function, $z = \\frac{2\\pi y}{a}$, is small. We can use the small-angle approximation $\\sin(z) \\approx z$.\n    $P(y) \\approx \\frac{2}{a}\\left(\\frac{2\\pi y}{a}\\right)^2 = \\frac{8\\pi^2 y^2}{a^3}$.\n*   Now, we integrate this approximate density:\n    $P \\approx \\int_{-0.005a}^{0.005a} \\frac{8\\pi^2 y^2}{a^3} dy = \\frac{8\\pi^2}{a^3} \\left[ \\frac{y^3}{3} \\right]_{-0.005a}^{0.005a}$\n*   $P \\approx \\frac{8\\pi^2}{3a^3} \\left[ (0.005a)^3 - (-0.005a)^3 \\right] = \\frac{8\\pi^2}{3a^3} \\left[ 2 \\times (0.005a)^3 \\right]$\n    $P \\approx \\frac{16\\pi^2}{3} (0.005)^3$\n\n**9. Final Calculation**\n*   $P \\approx \\frac{16\\pi^2}{3} (1.25 \\times 10^{-7})$\n*   $P \\approx (5.333 \\times \\pi^2) \\times (1.25 \\times 10^{-7})$\n*   $P \\approx (5.333 \\times 9.8696) \\times (1.25 \\times 10^{-7})$\n*   $P \\approx 52.638 \\times (1.25 \\times 10^{-7}) \\approx 6.5797 \\times 10^{-6}$\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n1.  **Correct State (n=2):** Ensure you use `n=2` in the wavefunction, not `n=1`. This changes the argument of the sine function and the location of nodes and antinodes.\n2.  **Probability vs. Wavefunction:** Remember to integrate the probability density `|ψ|^2`, not the wavefunction `ψ`.\n3.  **Trigonometric Identity:** Be careful when using the power-reduction formula. The angle in the cosine term is double the angle in the sine-squared term (`2θ`).\n4.  **Approximation at a Node:** The interval is centered on a node `x = 0.5a`, where `P(x) = 0`. A naive approximation `P ≈ P(0.5a) × Δx` will yield an incorrect result of 0. A more sophisticated approach, such as a Taylor series expansion of the integrand, is required.\n5.  **Catastrophic Cancellation:** When evaluating the exact expression $P = 0.01 - \\frac{\\sin(0.02\\pi)}{2\\pi}$, the two terms are very close in value. This requires high precision to avoid rounding errors. Using the Taylor expansion method avoids this issue.\n\nThe final calculated probability is approximately $6.58 \\times 10^{-6}$.\n\n<<<6.58e-6>>>"
