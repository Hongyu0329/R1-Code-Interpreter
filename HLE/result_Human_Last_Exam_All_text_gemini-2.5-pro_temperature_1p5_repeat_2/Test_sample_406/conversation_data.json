    "An FGH-tripled fixed point, for the given functions, is a triplet of points `(x, y, z)` with `x ∈ X`, `y ∈ Y`, and `z ∈ Z` that simultaneously satisfies a system of three equations. The existence and uniqueness of such a point can be guaranteed under specific conditions on the sets `X, Y, Z` and the functions `F, G, H` by applying the Banach Fixed Point Theorem to an operator defined on the product space `X × Y × Z`.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**1. Preliminary Clarifications and Definitions**\n\n*   **Typo Correction:** The question lists two functions named `G`. We assume this is a typo and the third function should be `H`. The system of functions is:\n    *   `F: X * Y * Z → X`\n    *   `G: Y * X * Y → Y`\n    *   `H: Z * Y * X → Z`\n*   **Definition of an FGH-Tripled Fixed Point:** An FGH-tripled fixed point is a triplet `(x, y, z) ∈ X × Y × Z` such that:\n    1.  `F(x, y, z) = x`\n    2.  `G(y, x, y) = y`\n    3.  `H(z, y, x) = z`\n    *   Note the specific arguments passed to each function, which are determined by their given signatures.\n\n**2. Framework for the Solution: The Banach Fixed Point Theorem**\n\nTo find conditions for the existence of this fixed point, we use a standard technique from fixed point theory.\n*   **Product Space:** We combine the sets `X`, `Y`, and `Z` into a single product space `M = X × Y × Z`.\n*   **Operator Definition:** We define an operator `T: M → M` such that a fixed point of `T` is an FGH-tripled fixed point. The operator is defined as:\n    `T(x, y, z) = ( F(x, y, z), G(y, x, y), H(z, y, x) )`\n    A fixed point of `T` is a point `(x*, y*, z*)` where `T(x*, y*, z*) = (x*, y*, z*)`, which is exactly the system of equations defining the FGH-tripled fixed point.\n*   **Applying Banach's Theorem:** The Banach Fixed Point Theorem states that if `(M, d)` is a **complete metric space** and `T: M → M` is a **contraction mapping**, then `T` has a unique fixed point.\n\nThis leads to the core conditions we need to impose.\n\n**3. Deriving the Conditions**\n\n**Condition 1: Complete Metric Spaces**\nFor the product space `M` to be a complete metric space, each of its component spaces must be a complete metric space.\n*   We must assume that `(X, d_X)`, `(Y, d_Y)`, and `(Z, d_Z)` are complete metric spaces.\n*   We can then define a metric `d` on `M = X × Y × Z`. A common and useful choice is the sum metric:\n    `d((x₁, y₁, z₁), (x₂, y₂, z₂)) = d_X(x₁, x₂) + d_Y(y₁, y₂) + d_Z(z₁, z₂)`\n\n**Condition 2: Contraction Mapping**\nFor `T` to be a contraction, we need to impose Lipschitz-type conditions on the functions `F`, `G`, and `H`. These conditions restrict how much the functions can \"stretch\" distances.\n\n*   **Lipschitz Condition on F:** There exist non-negative constants `α₁, α₂, α₃` such that for any two points in its domain:\n    `d_X(F(x₁, y₁, z₁), F(x₂, y₂, z₂)) ≤ α₁·d_X(x₁, x₂) + α₂·d_Y(y₁, y₂) + α₃·d_Z(z₁, z₂)`\n\n*   **Lipschitz Condition on G:** There exist non-negative constants `β₁, β₂, β₃` such that for any two points in its domain:\n    `d_Y(G(y₁, x₁, y'₁), G(y₂, x₂, y'₂)) ≤ β₁·d_Y(y₁, y₂) + β₂·d_X(x₁, x₂) + β₃·d_Y(y'₁, y'₂)`\n\n*   **Lipschitz Condition on H:** There exist non-negative constants `γ₁, γ₂, γ₃` such that for any two points in its domain:\n    `d_Z(H(z₁, y₁, x₁), H(z₂, y₂, x₂)) ≤ γ₁·d_Z(z₁, z₂) + γ₂·d_Y(y₁, y₂) + γ₃·d_X(x₁, x₂)`\n\n**Condition 3: The Overall Contraction Condition**\nNow, we combine these individual conditions to show that the operator `T` is a contraction on `(M, d)`. Let `u₁ = (x₁, y₁, z₁)` and `u₂ = (x₂, y₂, z₂)`.\n\n`d(T(u₁), T(u₂)) = d_X(F(x₁...), F(x₂...)) + d_Y(G(y₁,x₁,y₁), G(y₂,x₂,y₂)) + d_Z(H(z₁,y₁,x₁), H(z₂,y₂,x₂))`\n\nApplying the Lipschitz conditions (and substituting the correct variables into `G`'s inequality):\n`d_Y(G(y₁,x₁,y₁), G(y₂,x₂,y₂)) ≤ β₁·d_Y(y₁,y₂) + β₂·d_X(x₁,x₂) + β₃·d_Y(y₁,y₂) = (β₁+β₃)·d_Y(y₁,y₂) + β₂·d_X(x₁,x₂)`\n\nSubstituting all inequalities and grouping terms by `d_X`, `d_Y`, and `d_Z`:\n`d(T(u₁), T(u₂)) ≤ (α₁ + β₂ + γ₃)d_X(x₁,x₂) + (α₂ + β₁ + β₃ + γ₂)d_Y(y₁,y₂) + (α₃ + γ₁)d_Z(z₁,z₂)`\n\nFor `T` to be a contraction, there must be a `k < 1` such that `d(T(u₁), T(u₂)) ≤ k·d(u₁,u₂)`. A sufficient condition is that each grouped coefficient is less than `k`.\nLet `k = max { (α₁ + β₂ + γ₃), (α₂ + β₁ + β₃ + γ₂), (α₃ + γ₁) }`.\nThe operator `T` is a contraction if `k < 1`.\n\n### **Final Conditions**\n\nBased on the analysis, a set of sufficient conditions for the existence and uniqueness of an FGH-tripled fixed point is as follows:\n\n1.  **Spaces:** `(X, d_X)`, `(Y, d_Y)`, and `(Z, d_Z)` must be **complete metric spaces**.\n2.  **Lipschitz Conditions:** The functions `F`, `G`, and `H` must satisfy the Lipschitz-type conditions defined above with non-negative constants `αᵢ, βᵢ, γᵢ`.\n3.  **Contraction Coefficients:** The sum of these constants must satisfy the following inequality:\n    `max { (α₁ + β₂ + γ₃), (α₂ + β₁ + β₃ + γ₂), (α₃ + γ₁) } < 1`\n\nIf all these conditions are met, then by the Banach Fixed Point Theorem, there exists a **unique** FGH-tripled fixed point `(x*, y*, z*)`.\n\n<<<Let `(X, d_X)`, `(Y, d_Y)`, and `(Z, d_Z)` be complete metric spaces. Let `F: X * Y * Z → X`, `G: Y * X * Y → Y`, and `H: Z * Y * X → Z` be functions for which there exist non-negative constants `α₁, α₂, α₃, β₁, β₂, β₃, γ₁, γ₂, γ₃` such that for all `x₁, x₂, x ∈ X`, `y₁, y₂, y, y'₁, y'₂ ∈ Y`, `z₁, z₂, z ∈ Z`:\n1. `d_X(F(x₁, y₁, z₁), F(x₂, y₂, z₂)) ≤ α₁·d_X(x₁, x₂) + α₂·d_Y(y₁, y₂) + α₃·d_Z(z₁, z₂)`\n2. `d_Y(G(y₁, x₁, y'₁), G(y₂, x₂, y'₂)) ≤ β₁·d_Y(y₁, y₂) + β₂·d_X(x₁, x₂) + β₃·d_Y(y'₁, y'₂)`\n3. `d_Z(H(z₁, y₁, x₁), H(z₂, y₂, x₂)) ≤ γ₁·d_Z(z₁, z₂) + γ₂·d_Y(y₁, y₂) + γ₃·d_X(x₁, x₂)`\nA sufficient condition for the existence of a unique FGH-tripled fixed point is that the sum of these coefficients satisfies: `max { (α₁ + β₂ + γ₃), (α₂ + β₁ + β₃ + γ₂), (α₃ + γ₁) } < 1`.>>>"
