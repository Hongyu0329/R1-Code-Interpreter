    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $d=53599$ and order 6.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the conductor $d$\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of the conductor $d = 53599$.\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item $d$ is odd, so it's not divisible by 2.\n    \\item The sum of digits is $5+3+5+9+9=31$, not divisible by 3.\n    \\item It does not end in 0 or 5, so not divisible by 5.\n    \\item Checking for divisibility by 7: $53599 = 7 \\times 7657$.\n    \\item Now we factor 7657. Let's try small prime factors.\n    \\item Checking for 13: $7657 = 13 \\times 589$.\n    \\item Now we factor 589. We can test primes up to $\\sqrt{589} \\approx 24.2$.\n    \\item Checking for 19: $589 = 19 \\times 31$.\n    \\item Both 19 and 31 are prime numbers.\n\\end{itemize}\nSo, the prime factorization of $d$ is $d = 7 \\times 13 \\times 19 \\times 31$.\nThis is a square-free integer.\n\n### Step 2: Properties of Primitive Characters\nA Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $d$ can be uniquely written as a product of characters $\\chi = \\chi_{p_1} \\chi_{p_2} \\dots \\chi_{p_k}$, where $d = p_1 p_2 \\dots p_k$ is the prime factorization of $d$ and $\\chi_{p_i}$ is a character modulo $p_i$.\n\nFor a square-free conductor $d$, a character $\\chi$ modulo $d$ is **primitive** if and only if each of its component characters $\\chi_{p_i}$ is non-trivial. A character $\\chi_p$ modulo a prime $p$ is non-trivial if it is not the principal character (i.e., its order is greater than 1). The conductor of a non-trivial character modulo a prime $p$ is $p$. The conductor of the product character is the product of the conductors of the components, so $\\text{cond}(\\chi) = \\prod_i \\text{cond}(\\chi_{p_i}) = \\prod_i p_i = d$.\n\nSo, we are looking for the number of characters $\\chi = \\chi_7 \\chi_{13} \\chi_{19} \\chi_{31}$ such that each $\\chi_p$ is a non-trivial character modulo $p$.\n\n### Step 3: The Order of the Character\nThe order of a product character $\\chi = \\prod_i \\chi_{p_i}$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters:\n$\\text{order}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{order}(\\chi_7), \\text{order}(\\chi_{13}), \\text{order}(\\chi_{19}), \\text{order}(\\chi_{31}))$.\n\nWe are given that the order of $\\chi$ is 6. Let $o_p = \\text{order}(\\chi_p)$. We must have:\n$\\text{lcm}(o_7, o_{13}, o_{19}, o_{31}) = 6$.\n\n### Step 4: Conditions on the Orders of Component Characters\nFrom the lcm condition, we can deduce several properties for the orders $o_p$:\n1.  Each $o_p$ must be a divisor of 6.\n2.  From the primitivity condition, each $\\chi_p$ is non-trivial, so $o_p > 1$.\n3.  Combining these, each order $o_p$ must be in the set $\\{2, 3, 6\\}$.\n4.  The lcm is 6. This implies that there must be at least one character whose order is a multiple of 2, and at least one character whose order is a multiple of 3.\n\n### Step 5: Counting Characters of a Specific Order Modulo a Prime\nThe group of characters modulo a prime $p$, $\\widehat{(\\mathbb{Z}/p\\mathbb{Z})^*}$, is a cyclic group of order $p-1$. In a cyclic group of order $n$, the number of elements of order $k$ (for any $k$ that divides $n$) is given by Euler's totient function, $\\phi(k)$.\n\nWe need to check if characters of orders 2, 3, and 6 exist for each of our primes:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item For $p=7$, $p-1=6$. Since 2, 3, and 6 all divide 6, characters of these orders exist.\n    \\item For $p=13$, $p-1=12$. Since 2, 3, and 6 all divide 12, characters of these orders exist.\n    \\item For $p=19$, $p-1=18$. Since 2, 3, and 6 all divide 18, characters of these orders exist.\n    \\item For $p=31$, $p-1=30$. Since 2, 3, and 6 all divide 30, characters of these orders exist.\n\\end{itemize}\nFor each prime $p \\in \\{7, 13, 19, 31\\}$, the number of available characters with orders in $\\{2, 3, 6\\}$ are:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item Number of characters of order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$.\n    \\item Number of characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n    \\item Number of characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = \\phi(2)\\phi(3) = 1 \\times 2 = 2$.\n\\end{itemize}\nFor each prime $p$, the total number of characters with order in $\\{2, 3, 6\\}$ is $\\phi(2)+\\phi(3)+\\phi(6) = 1+2+2=5$.\n\n### Step 6: Calculation using the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion\nWe need to count the number of 4-tuples of characters $(\\chi_7, \\chi_{13}, \\chi_{19}, \\chi_{31})$ where each $\\chi_p$ has an order $o_p \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$ and their lcm is 6.\n\nLet $S$ be the set of all possible 4-tuples where each $\\chi_p$ has an order from $\\{2, 3, 6\\}$. Since there are 5 choices for each of the 4 component characters, the total number of such tuples is:\n$|S| = 5 \\times 5 \\times 5 \\times 5 = 5^4 = 625$.\n\nNow we subtract the tuples where the lcm of orders is not 6. Since all orders are in $\\{2, 3, 6\\}$, the lcm will always be a divisor of 6. The lcm is not 6 if it is a proper divisor, i.e., 2 or 3.\n\nCase 1: The lcm of the orders divides 3.\nThis occurs if and only if all the orders $o_p$ are divisors of 3. From our set of allowed orders $\\{2, 3, 6\\}$, this means $o_p=3$ for all $p$.\nThe number of ways to choose a character of order 3 for each of the four primes is:\n$N_3 = (\\phi(3))^4 = 2^4 = 16$.\nFor these 16 tuples, the lcm of the orders is 3.\n\nCase 2: The lcm of the orders divides 2.\nThis occurs if and only if all the orders $o_p$ are divisors of 2. From our set of allowed orders $\\{2, 3, 6\\}$, this means $o_p=2$ for all $p$.\nThe number of ways to choose a character of order 2 for each of the four primes is:\n$N_2 = (\\phi(2))^4 = 1^4 = 1$.\nFor this 1 tuple, the lcm of the orders is 2.\n\nThe two cases are disjoint. Therefore, the number of tuples where the lcm is not 6 is $N_3 + N_2 = 16 + 1 = 17$.\n\nThe number of primitive characters of order 6 is the total number of tuples in $S$ minus the ones where the lcm is not 6:\nNumber of characters = $|S| - (N_3 + N_2) = 625 - 17 = 608$."
