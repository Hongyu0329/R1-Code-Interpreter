    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the core elements of the question:** The user is asking for the specific year that a person, identified as \"Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan,\" publicly identified himself by the name \"Azikiwe.\"\n\n2.  **Verify the name of the public figure:** The individual in question is Goodluck Jonathan, the former President of Nigeria. It is crucial to verify his full and official name. Research confirms his name is **Goodluck Ebele Jonathan**. The name \"Azikiwe\" is not part of his given names or surname.\n\n3.  **Identify the source of the name \"Azikiwe\":** The name \"Azikiwe\" is famously associated with another major figure in Nigerian history, **Nnamdi Azikiwe**, who was the first President of Nigeria. This suggests a potential confusion between the two individuals.\n\n4.  **Investigate the premise of the question:** The question assumes that Goodluck Ebele Jonathan at some point publicly adopted or identified himself with the name \"Azikiwe.\" We must search for any evidence to support this claim. This would involve checking:\n    *   Official statements or records.\n    *   Major speeches or interviews.\n    *   Credible news archives and media reports.\n    *   Biographies and historical accounts of his life and presidency.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the findings:** A thorough search of credible sources reveals no evidence that Goodluck Ebele Jonathan ever added \"Azikiwe\" to his name or publicly identified himself as \"Azikiwe.\" The premise of the question is factually incorrect. He has consistently been known by his official name, Goodluck Ebele Jonathan.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Accuracy of Names:** Always verify the official names of public figures. The question contains a factual error in the name \"Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan.\"\n*   **Validity of the Premise:** Before searching for a date, first confirm that the event in question actually happened. In this case, the event did not occur.\n*   **Potential for Confusion:** It is common for names of prominent historical figures to be confused. The user likely confused or conflated Goodluck Jonathan with Nnamdi Azikiwe.\n*   **Conclusion based on Absence of Evidence:** Since no credible sources support the claim, the only logical conclusion is that it never happened. It is impossible to provide a year for an event that did not take place.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nBased on the analysis, the question is based on a false premise. Goodluck Ebele Jonathan's name does not include \"Azikiwe,\" and there is no public record of him ever identifying himself by that name. Therefore, there is no year to provide.\n\n<<<There is no record of Goodluck Ebele Jonathan ever publicly identifying himself as Azikiwe. His full name is Goodluck Ebele Jonathan. The name Azikiwe belongs to Nnamdi Azikiwe, the first president of Nigeria. The premise of the question is incorrect.>>>"
