    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rank of the third homotopy group $\\pi_3(X)$ for a smooth quintic hypersurface $X$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the object and its basic topological properties\n\n*   $X$ is a hypersurface in the complex projective space $\\mathbb{CP}^3$, defined by a single homogeneous polynomial of degree 5.\n*   The condition that $X$ is *smooth* implies it is a complex manifold.\n*   The complex dimension of $\\mathbb{CP}^3$ is 3. As a hypersurface, the complex dimension of $X$ is $\\dim_{\\mathbb{C}}(X) = 3 - 1 = 2$.\n*   As a real manifold, the dimension of $X$ is $\\dim_{\\mathbb{R}}(X) = 2 \\times \\dim_{\\mathbb{C}}(X) = 4$. So, $X$ is a compact, oriented, real 4-manifold.\n*   **Lefschetz Hyperplane Theorem:** This theorem relates the topology of $X$ to the topology of the ambient space $\\mathbb{CP}^3$. For homotopy groups, it states that the inclusion map $i: X \\to \\mathbb{CP}^3$ induces isomorphisms $i_*: \\pi_q(X) \\to \\pi_q(\\mathbb{CP}^3)$ for $q < \\dim_{\\mathbb{C}}(X) = 2$.\n*   We know that $\\pi_1(\\mathbb{CP}^3) = 0$. By the Lefschetz theorem for $q=1$, we have $\\pi_1(X) \\cong \\pi_1(\\mathbb{CP}^3) = 0$. Thus, $X$ is simply connected.\n*   Since $\\pi_1(X) = 0$, the first homology group $H_1(X; \\mathbb{Z})$ is the abelianization of $\\pi_1(X)$, so $H_1(X; \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$.\n\n### Step 2: Compute the Betti numbers of X\n\nThe Betti numbers $b_k = \\text{rank}(H_k(X; \\mathbb{Z}))$ are related by the Euler characteristic $\\chi(X) = b_0 - b_1 + b_2 - b_3 + b_4$.\n\n1.  **$b_0, b_1, b_3, b_4$:**\n    *   Since $X$ is a smooth hypersurface, it is connected, so $b_0=1$.\n    *   As shown above, $H_1(X; \\mathbb{Z})=0$, so $b_1=0$.\n    *   Since $X$ is a compact, oriented 4-manifold, Poincaré duality holds: $H_k(X) \\cong H^{4-k}(X)$.\n    *   $b_4 = \\text{rank}(H_4(X)) = \\text{rank}(H^0(X))$. Since $X$ is connected, $H^0(X) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$, so $b_4=1$.\n    *   $b_3 = \\text{rank}(H_3(X)) = \\text{rank}(H^1(X))$. The Universal Coefficient Theorem gives $H^1(X; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\text{Hom}(H_1(X; \\mathbb{Z}), \\mathbb{Z}) \\oplus \\text{Ext}^1(H_0(X; \\mathbb{Z}), \\mathbb{Z})$. Since $H_1(X)=0$ and $H_0(X)=\\mathbb{Z}$ (which is free), both terms are zero. So $H^1(X; \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$, and $b_3=0$.\n    *   It's a known fact that the homology of a smooth complex hypersurface is torsion-free.\n\n2.  **$\\chi(X)$ and $b_2$:**\n    *   The topological Euler characteristic $\\chi(X)$ can be computed by integrating the top Chern class of the tangent bundle of $X$. For a hypersurface of degree $d$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^n$, the tangent bundle $T_X$ fits into the sequence $0 \\to T_X \\to T_{\\mathbb{CP}^n}|_X \\to N_{X/\\mathbb{CP}^n} \\to 0$.\n    *   For $X_5 \\subset \\mathbb{CP}^3$ ($d=5, n=3$), the normal bundle is $N_X \\cong \\mathcal{O}_X(5)$. The total Chern class of $X$ is $c(T_X) = c(T_{\\mathbb{CP}^3}|_X) / c(N_X) = (1+h)^4 / (1+5h)$, where $h$ is the hyperplane class on $X$.\n    *   Expanding this gives $c(T_X) = (1+4h+6h^2+\\dots)(1-5h+25h^2-\\dots) = 1 - h + 11h^2 + \\dots$.\n    *   So, the second Chern class is $c_2(X) = 11h^2$.\n    *   $\\chi(X) = \\int_X c_2(X) = \\int_X 11h^2 = 11 \\int_X h^2$. The integral $\\int_X h^2$ is the degree of the surface, which is 5.\n    *   $\\chi(X) = 11 \\cdot 5 = 55$.\n    *   Now use the Euler-Poincaré formula: $\\chi(X) = b_0 - b_1 + b_2 - b_3 + b_4 = 1 - 0 + b_2 - 0 + 1 = 2 + b_2$.\n    *   $55 = 2 + b_2 \\implies b_2 = 53$.\n\nSo the Betti numbers are $(b_0, b_1, b_2, b_3, b_4) = (1, 0, 53, 0, 1)$. Since the homology is torsion-free, we have $H_2(X; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^{53}$.\n\n### Step 3: Relate Homotopy and Homology Groups\n\nWe want to find the rank of $\\pi_3(X)$. Since $\\pi_1(X)=0$, $X$ is not 2-connected ($ \\pi_2(X) \\neq 0$), so the Hurewicz map $h_3: \\pi_3(X) \\to H_3(X)$ is not an isomorphism.\n\nWe use a standard result from homotopy theory, an exact sequence due to Whitehead/Pontryagin that holds for any 1-connected space:\n$H_4(X) \\xrightarrow{p} \\Gamma(H_2(X)) \\xrightarrow{w_*} \\pi_3(X) \\xrightarrow{h_3} H_3(X) \\to 0$\n\n1.  **Analyze the terms in the sequence:**\n    *   $H_4(X) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n    *   $H_3(X) = 0$.\n    *   $H_2(X) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^{53}$.\n    *   $\\Gamma(A)$ is the Whitehead universal quadratic functor. For a free abelian group $A \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^k$, $\\Gamma(A)$ is known to have rank equal to the rank of $A \\wedge A$, which is $\\binom{k}{2}$. So, $\\text{rank}(\\Gamma(H_2(X))) = \\binom{53}{2} = \\frac{53 \\times 52}{2} = 1378$.\n\n2.  **Analyze the sequence:**\n    *   Substituting the known groups, the sequence becomes:\n        $\\mathbb{Z} \\xrightarrow{p} \\Gamma(\\mathbb{Z}^{53}) \\xrightarrow{w_*} \\pi_3(X) \\to 0$.\n    *   This implies that $w_*$ is surjective and its kernel is the image of $p$. Therefore, $\\pi_3(X) \\cong \\text{coker}(p) = \\Gamma(H_2(X))/\\text{Im}(p)$.\n\n3.  **Find the rank of $\\pi_3(X)$:**\n    *   The rank of $\\pi_3(X)$ is given by $\\text{rank}(\\pi_3(X)) = \\text{rank}(\\Gamma(H_2(X))) - \\text{rank}(\\text{Im}(p))$.\n    *   We know $\\text{rank}(\\Gamma(H_2(X))) = 1378$.\n    *   The map $p: H_4(X) \\to \\Gamma(H_2(X))$ is the Pontryagin homomorphism. It is non-trivial if and only if the intersection pairing on $H_2(X)$ is non-trivial.\n    *   By Poincaré duality on the compact oriented 4-manifold $X$, the intersection form $H_2(X) \\times H_2(X) \\to \\mathbb{Z}$ is non-degenerate and unimodular. In particular, it is not the zero map. For example, the self-intersection of a hyperplane section is $\\deg(X) = 5 \\neq 0$.\n    *   Since the map $p$ is non-zero and its domain is $\\mathbb{Z}$, its image is a rank-1 subgroup of $\\Gamma(H_2(X))$. Thus, $\\text{rank}(\\text{Im}(p)) = 1$.\n\n4.  **Final Calculation:**\n    *   $\\text{rank}(\\pi_3(X)) = 1378 - 1 = 1377$.\n\nThe rank of the third homotopy group $\\pi_3(X)$ is 1377.\n\n<<<1377>>>"
