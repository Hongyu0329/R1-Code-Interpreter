    "An analysis of the problem statement and derivation of the solution.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Tensor and the Vector Spaces\n\n*   The space $V_1^{\\otimes n}$ (and similarly for $V_2, V_3$) is the space of functions from $\\{0, 1\\}^n$ to $\\mathbb{C}$. This is a complex vector space of dimension $2^n$.\n*   The overall space $V_1^{\\otimes n} \\otimes V_2^{\\otimes n} \\otimes V_3^{\\otimes n}$ is the space of functions from $\\{0, 1\\}^n \\times \\{0, 1\\}^n \\times \\{0, 1\\}^n$ to $\\mathbb{C}$.\n*   The function in question is $F(x, y, z) = \\prod_{i=1}^n (x_i + y_i + z_i) - 1$, which is an element of this tensor product space. We want to find its slice rank.\n\n### Step 2: Define Slice Rank\n\n*   A tensor $T \\in U \\otimes V \\otimes W$ is a \"slice\" (or has slice rank 1) if it can be written in one of the following forms:\n    *   $u \\otimes T_{VW}$ for $u \\in U, T_{VW} \\in V \\otimes W$\n    *   $v \\otimes T_{UW}$ for $v \\in V, T_{UW} \\in U \\otimes W$\n    *   $w \\otimes T_{UV}$ for $w \\in W, T_{UV} \\in U \\otimes V$\n*   In function notation, $F(x,y,z)$ has slice rank 1 if $F(x,y,z) = a(x)b(y,z)$ or $F(x,y,z) = c(y)d(x,z)$ or $F(x,y,z) = e(z)f(x,y)$.\n*   The slice rank of a general tensor is the minimum number of slice rank 1 tensors that sum up to it.\n\n### Step 3: Decompose the Tensor $F$\n\nThe function $F(x,y,z)$ can be written as the difference of two tensors:\n1.  $G(x, y, z) = \\prod_{i=1}^n (x_i + y_i + z_i)$\n2.  $H(x, y, z) = 1$\n\nSo, $F = G - H$.\n\n*   Let's analyze $H$. The constant function $H(x,y,z)=1$ can be written as $a(x)b(y,z)$ where $a(x)=1$ for all $x$, and $b(y,z)=1$ for all $y,z$. Thus, $H$ is a slice and its slice rank is 1. `slice-rank(H) = 1`.\n\n*   Let's analyze $G$. The function $G$ is a product of functions, each depending on a single coordinate index $i$. This structure implies that $G$ is a tensor product of smaller tensors.\n    *   Let $T_i(x_i, y_i, z_i) = x_i + y_i + z_i$. This is a tensor in $V_1 \\otimes V_2 \\otimes V_3$.\n    *   Then $G = \\bigotimes_{i=1}^n T_i$.\n\n### Step 4: Use the Multiplicative Property of Slice Rank\n\nA key property of slice rank is that it is multiplicative with respect to the tensor product:\n`slice-rank(A ⊗ B) = slice-rank(A) * slice-rank(B)`.\n\nApplying this property to $G$:\n`slice-rank(G) = slice-rank(T_1 ⊗ T_2 ⊗ ... ⊗ T_n) = (slice-rank(T_1))^n`.\n\nSo, the problem boils down to finding the slice rank of the small $2 \\times 2 \\times 2$ tensor $T_1(x_1, y_1, z_1) = x_1 + y_1 + z_1$.\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the Slice Rank of the Small Tensor $T_1$\n\nLet's denote $T_1$ as $T(x,y,z) = x+y+z$ for $x,y,z \\in \\{0,1\\}$.\nWe can express $T$ as a sum of slices:\n$T(x,y,z) = x \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1 + 1 \\cdot y \\cdot 1 + 1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot z$.\nThis can be written as a sum of three slices:\n1.  $S_1(x,y,z) = x \\cdot 1(y,z)$: a type-1 slice.\n2.  $S_2(x,y,z) = y \\cdot 1(x,z)$: a type-2 slice.\n3.  $S_3(x,y,z) = z \\cdot 1(x,y)$: a type-3 slice.\n\nThe sum is $S_1+S_2+S_3$. This shows that `slice-rank(T) ≤ 3`.\n\nTo find a lower bound, we can inspect the rank of matrix slices of $T$. Let's fix one variable, say $z=0$, and look at the matrix $M_0(x,y) = T(x,y,0) = x+y$.\nThe matrix entries are:\n$M_0(0,0)=0, M_0(0,1)=1, M_0(1,0)=1, M_0(1,1)=2$.\nSo, $M_0 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nThe determinant is $0 \\cdot 2 - 1 \\cdot 1 = -1 \\neq 0$, so the rank of this matrix is 2.\n\nThe slice rank of a tensor is at least the maximum rank of any of its matrix slices. Therefore, `slice-rank(T) ≥ rank(M_0) = 2`.\nSo, the slice rank of $T$ is either 2 or 3. It is a known result (and can be proven by attempting a 2-slice decomposition and showing it fails) that for this tensor over $\\mathbb{C}$, the slice rank is exactly 3.\n\n`slice-rank(T_1) = 3`.\n\n### Step 6: Calculate the Asymptotic Slice Rank of F\n\nNow we can compute the slice rank of $G$:\n`slice-rank(G) = (slice-rank(T_1))^n = 3^n`.\n\nWe have $F = G - H$. The slice rank of a sum (or difference) of tensors satisfies the triangle inequality:\n`slice-rank(A - B) ≤ slice-rank(A) + slice-rank(B)`.\nSo, `slice-rank(F) ≤ slice-rank(G) + slice-rank(H) = 3^n + 1`.\n\nAlso, `slice-rank(A) ≤ slice-rank(A - B) + slice-rank(B)`, which implies:\n`slice-rank(F) ≥ slice-rank(G) - slice-rank(H) = 3^n - 1`.\n\nCombining these, we have $3^n - 1 \\le \\text{slice-rank}(F) \\le 3^n + 1$.\nAsymptotically for large $n$, the slice rank of $F$ behaves like $3^n$. More formally, `slice-rank(F) = 3^n(1+o(1))`.\n\n### Step 7: Solve for K\n\nThe problem states that the slice rank of $F$ is $(3/2^K)^n e^{o(n)}$.\nThe term $e^{o(n)}$ accounts for sub-exponential factors, so we can write this as $(3/2^K)^n (1+o(1))$.\nEquating the two asymptotic expressions for the slice rank:\n$3^n (1+o(1)) = (3/2^K)^n (1+o(1))$\n\nTaking the $n$-th root and letting $n \\to \\infty$:\n$3 = \\frac{3}{2^K}$\nThis implies $2^K = 1$.\nSince $K$ is a constant, we must have $K=0$."
