    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the current Vietnamese province where Ming General Mu Sheng experienced his first major defeat.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Key Historical Figures and Context:**\n    *   **Mu Sheng (沐晟):** A prominent general of the Chinese Ming Dynasty.\n    *   **Context:** The Lam Sơn Uprising (1418–1427), a Vietnamese independence movement led by Lê Lợi against the Ming occupation of Vietnam (known as the Fourth Era of Northern Domination).\n\n2.  **Define \"First Major Defeat\":**\n    *   We need to find a significant battle where Mu Sheng was the commanding general and his army was decisively defeated, leading to a strategic failure.\n    *   Early in the Lam Sơn Uprising, Mu Sheng campaigned against Lê Lợi's forces, particularly in the mountainous regions of Thanh Hóa. While there were battles, Mu Sheng also had successes and nearly crushed the rebellion in its early stages. These early engagements might not qualify as a \"major defeat\" for Mu Sheng personally as commander-in-chief of a large field army.\n    *   The most significant Ming defeats occurred in the final stages of the war, in 1426-1427.\n\n3.  **Examine the Major Battles of 1426-1427:**\n    *   **Battle of Tốt Động – Chúc Động (late 1426):** A massive Ming defeat near modern-day Hanoi. However, the Ming commander in this battle was Wang Tong (Vương Thông), not Mu Sheng.\n    *   **Battle of Chi Lăng – Xương Giang (late 1427):** A decisive Vietnamese victory where a large Ming relief army was completely annihilated. The commander of this army was Liu Sheng (柳升).\n    *   **Mu Sheng's Final Campaign (late 1427):** Simultaneously with Liu Sheng's advance from Guangxi, Mu Sheng led a second large relief army from Yunnan. His objective was to relieve the besieged Ming forces in Đông Quan (Hanoi). Upon hearing the news of Liu Sheng's catastrophic defeat at Chi Lăng, morale in Mu Sheng's army plummeted.\n\n4.  **Pinpoint Mu Sheng's Defeat:**\n    *   Lê Lợi dispatched his generals, Phạm Văn Xảo and Trịnh Khả, to intercept Mu Sheng's army, which was advancing south from Yunnan.\n    *   The Vietnamese forces prepared ambushes at strategic locations. The decisive engagement occurred at **Lãnh Câu (冷溝, \"Cold Trench\")** and **Đan Xá (丹舍)**.\n    *   At these locations, Mu Sheng's army was attacked and decisively defeated. He was forced to abandon his mission and retreat back into Yunnan. This was a clear, major defeat where he was the commander-in-chief, and it marked the end of the Ming attempt to salvage their position in Vietnam. This event is widely considered his most significant personal defeat in the campaign.\n\n5.  **Locate the Battlefield on a Modern Map:**\n    *   Historical records, including the Vietnamese chronicle *Đại Việt sử ký toàn thư*, place the battle sites of Lãnh Câu and Đan Xá in the historical administrative region of Tuyên Quang.\n    *   Mu Sheng's invasion route from Yunnan would have taken him down the valleys of the Clear River (Sông Lô) and Chay River (Sông Chảy).\n    *   This historical region corresponds directly to the modern-day **Tuyên Quang Province** in the northern highlands of Vietnam.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Distinguishing \"First\" from \"Major\":** While Mu Sheng faced resistance earlier, the defeat at Lãnh Câu-Đan Xá was his first personal defeat as the commander of a major field army with a strategic objective, which he failed to achieve due to the battle.\n*   **Correct Commander:** It is crucial to distinguish this battle from others fought around the same time. The famous victory at Chi Lăng was against Liu Sheng's army, not Mu Sheng's.\n*   **Geographical Accuracy:** The mapping of historical battle sites (Lãnh Câu, Đan Xá) to modern provinces relies on historical and geographical analysis of the army's known invasion route from Yunnan, which places the events squarely within the territory of present-day Tuyên Quang.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe first major defeat experienced by Ming General Mu Sheng was at the Battle of Lãnh Câu-Đan Xá in 1427. This battle took place in the territory that is now the modern Vietnamese province of Tuyên Quang.\n\n<<<Tuyên Quang Province>>>"
