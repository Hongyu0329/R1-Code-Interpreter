    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the determinant of the given matrix.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the core task:** The main objective is to compute the determinant of a matrix. The problem provides the specific matrix in question.\n    \\[\n    A = \\begin{bmatrix} \n    2 & -1 & -1 \\\\ \n    -1 & 2 & -1 \\\\ \n    -1 & -1 & 2 \n    \\end{bmatrix}.\n    \\]\n\n2.  **Analyze the context:** The question mentions this matrix `A` in the context of a \"Markov quiver for \\( m_{1/2} = 13 \\)\".\n    *   A **quiver** is a directed graph. Its **adjacency matrix** typically has non-negative integer entries representing the number of arrows between vertices. The given matrix `A` has negative entries, so it's not a standard adjacency matrix. In fields like representation theory and cluster algebras, such matrices with integer entries (not necessarily non-negative) are fundamental and are often called exchange matrices or Cartan matrices. The given matrix `A` is the well-known Cartan matrix for the affine Lie algebra of type \\( \\tilde{A}_2 \\).\n    *   The phrase \"where: A = ...\" strongly suggests that `A` is the specific matrix whose determinant we need to calculate.\n    *   The parameter \\( m_{1/2} = 13 \\) appears to be contextual information identifying a specific physical or mathematical system. Since the matrix `A` is given as a constant matrix with no dependence on `m`, this parameter does not enter into the calculation of the determinant of `A`.\n\n3.  **Choose a method for calculating the determinant:** For a 3x3 matrix, we can use several methods:\n    *   The Sarrus rule.\n    *   Cofactor expansion.\n    *   Row or column operations to simplify the matrix.\n\n    We will use row operations, as it is often the most efficient and least error-prone.\n\n4.  **Perform the calculation:**\n    Let's denote the rows of `A` as R1, R2, and R3.\n    \\[\n    A = \\begin{bmatrix} \n    2 & -1 & -1 \\\\ \n    -1 & 2 & -1 \\\\ \n    -1 & -1 & 2 \n    \\end{bmatrix}\n    \\]\n    A key property of determinants is that adding a multiple of one row to another row does not change the value of the determinant. Let's perform the operation `R1' = R1 + R2 + R3`.\n    *   The new first element of R1 is `2 + (-1) + (-1) = 0`.\n    *   The new second element of R1 is `-1 + 2 + (-1) = 0`.\n    *   The new third element of R1 is `-1 + (-1) + 2 = 0`.\n\n    So, the operation results in a new matrix `A'` with a row of zeros:\n    \\[\n    A' = \\begin{bmatrix} \n    0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ \n    -1 & 2 & -1 \\\\ \n    -1 & -1 & 2 \n    \\end{bmatrix}\n    \\]\n\n5.  **Final determinant evaluation:** The determinant of a matrix with a row or column consisting entirely of zeros is always zero. This is because when we compute the determinant using cofactor expansion along that zero row, every term will be multiplied by zero.\n    `det(A) = det(A') = 0 \\times C_{11} - 0 \\times C_{12} + 0 \\times C_{13} = 0`.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   The primary point of caution is not to be misled by the extra information \\( m_{1/2} = 13 \\). The problem gives a constant matrix `A` and asks for its determinant. Without explicit instructions on how to incorporate the parameter `m`, we must assume it is contextual.\n*   The term \"adjacency matrix\" is used loosely here, referring to the fundamental matrix defining the system's properties, which in this case is a singular Cartan matrix.\n*   The calculation can be verified by other methods. Using the Sarrus rule:\n    `det(A) = (2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2) + (-1 \\cdot -1 \\cdot -1) + (-1 \\cdot -1 \\cdot -1) - (-1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot -1) - (2 \\cdot -1 \\cdot -1) - (-1 \\cdot -1 \\cdot 2)`\n    `det(A) = 8 - 1 - 1 - 2 - 2 - 2`\n    `det(A) = 8 - 8 = 0`.\n    This confirms the result.\n\nThe determinant of the given matrix is 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
