The inability to see a resonance on a functional MRI coil with a VNA probe is possible and common. This happens because the coil is being tested outside of its required operating environment. The primary reasons are:

1.  **Active Detuning Circuits:** Most receive coils have protection circuits (using PIN diodes) that "detune" them to prevent damage from the scanner's high-power transmit pulse. On the test bench, without the control signal from the scanner to switch it "on," the coil remains in its default, non-resonant state.
2.  **Integrated Preamplifiers:** The coil is often integrated with a preamplifier. When unpowered, the preamplifier's input impedance improperly loads the coil, drastically lowering its Q-factor (quality factor) and making the resonance dip on the VNA too shallow and broad to be detected.
3.  **RF Shielding:** A Faraday shield, designed to block electric field noise, can also screen the coil from the near-field magnetic coupling of your probe, effectively hiding the resonance.
4.  **Phased Array Decoupling:** If the coil is an element in a phased array, its complex decoupling network, which is designed to prevent coupling between elements, may also prevent effective coupling with your external probe.
5.  **Probe Position:** You may have placed the probe in a "null" of the coil's magnetic field, where coupling is physically impossible due to the coil's geometry.

In short, the coil is fully functional, but only when it is integrated into the MRI system that provides the necessary power, control signals, and electrical terminations to make it resonant.
