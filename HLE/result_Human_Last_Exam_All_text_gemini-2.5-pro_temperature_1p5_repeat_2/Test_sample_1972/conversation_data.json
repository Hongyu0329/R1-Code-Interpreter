    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the novel and author in question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The question asks to identify a novel based on two specific descriptions provided by the Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges.\n    *   **Description of the novel:** It has \"the intensity of a tiger and the variety that a chess duel can achieve.\"\n    *   **Description of the author:** He is a \"continuator (and simplifier) of Faulkner.\"\n\n2.  **Careful Point 1: The Source:** The first and most crucial step is to trace these quotes to a specific text written by Borges. These are not general sentiments but precise phrases. They are most likely to be found in a prologue, essay, or literary review.\n\n3.  **Careful Point 2: Avoiding Misattribution:** There is a common misattribution of these quotes, particularly the description of the author as a follower of Faulkner, to Juan Rulfo and his novel *Pedro Páramo*. While Borges admired Rulfo and saw a thematic connection to Faulkner, he used the specific phrases in the question to describe a different author and work. A direct source check is essential.\n\n4.  **Tracing the Quotes:**\n    *   The phrase \"continuator (and simplifier) of Faulkner\" points to an author who uses modernist techniques (like multiple perspectives, fragmented timelines) but in a more direct or accessible way than the famously complex prose of William Faulkner.\n    *   The metaphor \"intensity of a tiger and the variety that a chess duel can achieve\" suggests a work that is both fiercely energetic and intellectually complex/structured.\n\n5.  **Locating the Primary Source:** The definitive source for these quotes is a short review by Jorge Luis Borges published in the literary magazine **_Sur_** (Issue No. 206, December 1951).\n\n6.  **Identifying the Subject of the Review:** In this review, Borges is analyzing the novel **_La colmena_** by the Spanish writer **Camilo José Cela**.\n\n7.  **Confirming the Quotes in Context:**\n    *   In the review, Borges explicitly praises Cela's technique, stating it is a **\"continuator (and simplifier) of that which Faulkner and Dos Passos inaugurated in the United States.\"**\n    *   He concludes his glowing assessment by writing that *La colmena* **\"has, at the same time, the intensity of a tiger and the variety that a chess duel can achieve.\"**\n\n8.  **Final Conclusion:** Both parts of the user's question point directly and unambiguously to Camilo José Cela's novel *La colmena*, known in English as *The Hive*.\n\n***\n\nThe novel Jorge Luis Borges refers to with these descriptions is **_The Hive_** (*La colmena*) by the Spanish author **Camilo José Cela**.\n\n<<<The Hive (La colmena)>>>"
