    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**1. Analyze the Differential Equation**\nThe given initial value problem is:\n$$\nx'(t) = (t-1) \\cdot x^2(t), \\quad x(0) = -8\n$$\n*   This is a first-order ordinary differential equation (ODE).\n*   The equation is non-linear due to the $x^2(t)$ term.\n*   We can rewrite $x'(t)$ as $\\frac{dx}{dt}$. The equation is $\\frac{dx}{dt} = (t-1)x^2$. This is a separable equation because we can group all terms involving $x$ on one side and all terms involving $t$ on the other.\n\n**2. Careful Points to Consider**\n*   **Separation of Variables:** We need to divide by $x^2$. We must first check if $x(t)=0$ is a solution. If $x(t)=0$, then $x'(t)=0$. Substituting into the ODE gives $0 = (t-1) \\cdot 0^2$, which is true. So, $x(t)=0$ is a constant (or equilibrium) solution. However, our initial condition is $x(0)=-8$, which is not zero. Therefore, the solution we are looking for is not the constant zero solution, and we can safely divide by $x^2$ for our solution.\n*   **Integration:** Be careful when integrating both sides. The integral of $\\frac{1}{x^2}$ is $-\\frac{1}{x}$, a common mistake is to think it's a logarithm.\n*   **Constant of Integration:** Don't forget to add the constant of integration, $C$, after performing the indefinite integrals.\n*   **Applying the Initial Condition:** Use the initial condition $x(0)=-8$ to find the specific value of the constant $C$. It is best to do this before solving for $x(t)$ explicitly to simplify the algebra.\n*   **Final Calculation:** Once the particular solution is found, substitute $t=1$ to get the final answer.\n\n**3. Step-by-Step Solution**\n\n**Step 1: Separate the variables**\nStarting from $\\frac{dx}{dt} = (t-1)x^2$, we separate the variables by moving all $x$ terms to the left side and all $t$ terms to the right side.\n$$\n\\frac{dx}{x^2} = (t-1)dt\n$$\n\n**Step 2: Integrate both sides**\nNow, we integrate both sides of the equation.\n$$\n\\int \\frac{1}{x^2} dx = \\int (t-1) dt\n$$\nPerforming the integration on both sides:\n*   Left side: $\\int x^{-2} dx = \\frac{x^{-1}}{-1} = -\\frac{1}{x}$\n*   Right side: $\\int (t-1) dt = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t$\n\nCombining these results, we get the general solution in implicit form:\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + C\n$$\nwhere $C$ is the constant of integration.\n\n**Step 3: Use the initial condition to find C**\nWe are given the initial condition $x(0) = -8$. We substitute $t=0$ and $x=-8$ into our equation to solve for $C$.\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{(-8)} = \\frac{(0)^2}{2} - (0) + C\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{1}{8} = 0 - 0 + C\n$$\nSo, the value of the constant is $C = \\frac{1}{8}$.\n\n**Step 4: Write the particular solution**\nNow we substitute the value of $C$ back into the general solution to get the particular solution for this initial value problem.\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + \\frac{1}{8}\n$$\n\n**Step 5: Find x(1)**\nWe need to find the value of $x(1)$. We can do this by substituting $t=1$ into the particular solution we just found.\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{(1)^2}{2} - (1) + \\frac{1}{8}\n$$\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{1}{2} - 1 + \\frac{1}{8}\n$$\nTo simplify the right side, find a common denominator (which is 8).\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{4}{8} - \\frac{8}{8} + \\frac{1}{8}\n$$\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{4 - 8 + 1}{8}\n$$\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{-3}{8}\n$$\nNow, we solve for $x(1)$.\n$$\n\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{3}{8}\n$$\n$$\nx(1) = \\frac{8}{3}\n$$\n\n<<<8/3>>>"
