    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the equilibrium values of entropy and mean energy for the Bose case of light quanta (photons).\n\n### **Analysis of the Question and Careful Points**\n\n1.  **Core Concepts:** The question requires using concepts from Large Deviation Theory (LDT), specifically the Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramer-Chernoff theorems, and applying them to a physical system: a gas of light quanta (photons).\n2.  **System Properties (Light Quanta):**\n    *   Photons are bosons, so they obey Bose-Einstein (BE) statistics.\n    *   A critical property of a photon gas is that the number of particles is not conserved (photons can be created and absorbed by the walls of their container). This implies that their chemical potential is zero ($\\mu=0$).\n3.  **Role of Large Deviation Theory (LDT):**\n    *   **Justification for Entropy Maximization:** The Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramer-Chernoff theorems provide a rigorous mathematical foundation for the second law of thermodynamics and the principle of maximum entropy in statistical mechanics. They essentially state that the probability of a system spontaneously exhibiting a macroscopic state other than the equilibrium (maximum entropy) state is exponentially small.\n    *   **Methodology:** The LDT framework justifies finding the equilibrium state by maximizing the entropy of the system subject to macroscopic constraints (like a fixed average energy). The system's evolution towards equilibrium is viewed as a process moving towards the most probable macroscopic state.\n4.  **Statistical Mechanics Formalism:**\n    *   **Entropy for Bosons:** We must use the correct entropy formula for indistinguishable bosons, which is derived from counting the number of ways to distribute particles into energy states: $S = k_B \\ln \\Omega_{BE}$. This is different from the Boltzmann entropy ($S = -k_B \\sum p_i \\ln p_i$).\n    *   **Ensemble:** Since the particle number is not fixed, the Grand Canonical Ensemble is the most appropriate framework. The equilibrium state is the one that minimizes the Grand Potential, $\\Phi = E - TS - \\mu N$. Since $\\mu=0$ for photons, this simplifies to minimizing $\\Phi = E - TS$.\n5.  **Calculation Steps:**\n    *   First, derive the equilibrium occupation number $\\langle N_j \\rangle$ for each energy level $E_j$ by maximizing the BE entropy under a fixed average energy constraint.\n    *   Second, use the derived distribution to calculate the total average energy $\\langle E \\rangle$. This will involve converting the sum over discrete energy levels to an integral over a continuous density of states for a photon gas in a 3D volume.\n    *   Third, calculate the equilibrium entropy $S$. This can be done by substituting the equilibrium distribution back into the BE entropy formula, but a more straightforward method is to use the thermodynamic relation $S = (\\langle E \\rangle - \\Phi)/T$, where $\\Phi$ is the Grand Potential.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Derivation**\n\n**Step 1: Finding the Equilibrium Distribution**\n\nThe principle of maximum entropy (justified by LDT) requires us to maximize the Bose-Einstein entropy,\n$S = k_B \\sum_j [ (N_j+g_j) \\ln(N_j+g_j) - N_j \\ln N_j - g_j \\ln g_j ]$, subject to the constraint of a fixed average energy $\\langle E \\rangle = \\sum_j N_j E_j$ and the fact that $\\mu=0$ (no particle number constraint). Here, $g_j$ is the degeneracy of energy level $j$.\n\nThe result of this maximization is the Bose-Einstein distribution for photons:\n$$ \\langle N_j \\rangle = \\frac{g_j}{e^{E_j/k_B T} - 1} $$\nwhere $T$ is the equilibrium temperature and $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant.\n\n**Step 2: Calculating the Equilibrium Mean Energy $\\langle E \\rangle$**\n\nFor a photon gas confined to a volume $V$, the discrete sum over energy levels is replaced by an integral over the continuous density of states, $g(E) dE = \\frac{8 \\pi V}{(hc)^3} E^2 dE$, where $h$ is Planck's constant and $c$ is the speed of light. The factor of 8 includes a factor of 2 for the two polarization states of the photon.\n\nThe mean energy is:\n$$ \\langle E \\rangle = \\int_0^\\infty E \\frac{1}{e^{E/k_B T} - 1} g(E) dE = \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{E}{e^{E/k_B T} - 1} \\frac{8 \\pi V}{(hc)^3} E^2 dE $$\n$$ \\langle E \\rangle = \\frac{8 \\pi V}{(hc)^3} \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{E^3}{e^{E/k_B T} - 1} dE $$\nTo solve the integral, we make the substitution $x = E/k_B T$. This gives:\n$$ \\langle E \\rangle = \\frac{8 \\pi V (k_B T)^4}{(hc)^3} \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{x^3}{e^x - 1} dx $$\nThe definite integral is a standard form related to the Riemann zeta function: $\\int_0^\\infty \\frac{x^3}{e^x - 1} dx = \\frac{\\pi^4}{15}$.\n\nSubstituting this value back, we get the equilibrium mean energy:\n$$ \\langle E \\rangle = \\frac{8 \\pi V (k_B T)^4}{(hc)^3} \\frac{\\pi^4}{15} = \\frac{8 \\pi^5 V (k_B T)^4}{15 (hc)^3} $$\nThis is the celebrated Stefan-Boltzmann Law for the energy of a black-body radiator.\n\n**Step 3: Calculating the Equilibrium Entropy $S$**\n\nWe use the thermodynamic relation involving the Grand Potential $\\Phi$: $S = (\\langle E \\rangle - \\Phi)/T$.\nThe Grand Potential is $\\Phi = -PV$. For a photon gas (an ultra-relativistic gas), the pressure $P$ is related to the energy density $u=\\langle E \\rangle / V$ by $P = u/3$.\nTherefore, $\\Phi = -(\\langle E \\rangle / 3V) V = - \\frac{\\langle E \\rangle}{3}$.\n\nNow we can find the entropy:\n$$ S = \\frac{\\langle E \\rangle - (-\\frac{1}{3}\\langle E \\rangle)}{T} = \\frac{\\frac{4}{3} \\langle E \\rangle}{T} $$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\langle E \\rangle$:\n$$ S = \\frac{4}{3T} \\left( \\frac{8 \\pi^5 V (k_B T)^4}{15 (hc)^3} \\right) = \\frac{32 \\pi^5 V k_B^4 T^3}{45 (hc)^3} $$\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nThe equilibrium values are functions of the system's volume $V$ and temperature $T$.\n\n*   **Equilibrium Mean Energy ($\\langle E \\rangle$):**\n    $$ \\langle E \\rangle = \\frac{8 \\pi^5 V (k_B T)^4}{15 (hc)^3} $$\n\n*   **Equilibrium Entropy ($S$):**\n    $$ S = \\frac{32 \\pi^5 V k_B^4 T^3}{45 (hc)^3} $$\n    Alternatively, the entropy can be expressed in terms of the mean energy as $S = \\frac{4 \\langle E \\rangle}{3 T}$.\n\n<<<\nEquilibrium Mean Energy: $\\langle E \\rangle = \\frac{8 \\pi^5 V (k_B T)^4}{15 (hc)^3}$\nEquilibrium Entropy: $S = \\frac{32 \\pi^5 V k_B^4 T^3}{45 (hc)^3}$\n>>>"
