    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Knots\nFirst, we list all the knots with a crossing number of at most four. We must account for chirality (whether a knot is distinct from its mirror image).\n*   **0 crossings:** The unknot ($0_1$). It is amphichiral (equivalent to its mirror image).\n*   **1 or 2 crossings:** There are no knots with 1 or 2 crossings.\n*   **3 crossings:** The trefoil knot ($3_1$). This knot is chiral. So we must consider both the right-handed trefoil (which we'll denote as $+3_1$) and the left-handed trefoil (denoted as $-3_1$).\n*   **4 crossings:** The figure-eight knot ($4_1$). This knot is amphichiral.\n\nSo, the full list of knots to consider is: Unknot ($0_1$), Right-handed Trefoil ($+3_1$), Left-handed Trefoil ($-3_1$), and Figure-eight Knot ($4_1$).\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Relevant Surgeries\nWe are considering an integral surgery on a knot $K$, which creates a 3-manifold denoted by $S^3_n(K)$, where $n$ is an integer framing. For this manifold to be an element of the homology cobordism group, it must be a **homology 3-sphere**.\n\nThe first homology group of the surgically constructed manifold is given by the formula $H_1(S^3_n(K); \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/|n|\\mathbb{Z}$.\nFor $S^3_n(K)$ to be a homology sphere, its first homology group must be trivial, i.e., $H_1(Y; \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$. This requires $|n|=1$.\n\nTherefore, for each knot, we only need to consider two surgeries: $+1$ surgery and $-1$ surgery.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Homology Spheres from Each Knot\n\nWe will analyze the homology cobordism classes of the manifolds resulting from $\\pm 1$ surgery on each of the knots identified in Step 1. Two manifolds, $Y_1$ and $Y_2$, represent the same element in the homology cobordism group $\\Theta_3^H$ if they are homology cobordant.\n\n**1. Unknot ($0_1$)**\n*   $S^3_{+1}(0_1)$ and $S^3_{-1}(0_1)$ are both homeomorphic to the standard 3-sphere, $S^3$.\n*   $S^3$ is the identity element in the homology cobordism group $\\Theta_3^H$.\n*   **Result:** The unknot produces one element: the identity class, $[S^3]$.\n\n**2. Right-Handed Trefoil ($+3_1$)**\n*   $S^3_{+1}(+3_1)$ is the Poincaré homology sphere, often denoted as $P$ or $\\Sigma(2,3,5)$.\n*   $S^3_{-1}(+3_1)$ is another Brieskorn homology sphere, $\\Sigma(2,3,7)$. Let's call this manifold $Y$.\n*   To determine if $[P]$ and $[Y]$ are distinct elements and different from the identity, we use homology cobordism invariants.\n    *   The **Rohlin invariant** $\\mu$ is a homomorphism from $\\Theta_3^H$ to $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$. For $\\pm 1$ surgery on a knot $K$, a known result states that $\\mu(S^3_{\\pm 1}(K)) = \\text{Arf}(K)$, where $\\text{Arf}(K)$ is the Arf invariant of the knot.\n    *   For the trefoil knot $3_1$, the Arf invariant is 1. Thus, $\\mu(P) = 1$ and $\\mu(Y) = 1$.\n    *   Since $\\mu(S^3)=0$, both $[P]$ and $[Y]$ are distinct from the identity element.\n    *   A deep result by M. Furuta, using Seiberg-Witten theory, shows that $P = \\Sigma(2,3,5)$ and $Y = \\Sigma(2,3,7)$ are **not** homology cobordant.\n*   **Result:** The right-handed trefoil produces two distinct, non-trivial elements: $[P]$ and $[Y]$.\n\n**3. Left-Handed Trefoil ($-3_1$)**\n*   The surgery manifold $S^3_n(-K)$ is the orientation-reversed manifold $-S^3_{-n}(K)$.\n*   $S^3_{+1}(-3_1)$ results in the manifold $-Y$. Its class is $[-Y]$.\n*   $S^3_{-1}(-3_1)$ results in the manifold $-P$. Its class is $[-P]$.\n*   A fundamental theorem states that an element $M \\in \\Theta_3^H$ has order 2 (i.e., $[M] = [-M]$) if and only if its Rohlin invariant $\\mu(M)$ is 1.\n*   Since $\\mu(P)=1$ and $\\mu(Y)=1$, both $[P]$ and $[Y]$ are elements of order 2. Therefore, $[P]=[-P]$ and $[Y]=[-Y]$.\n*   **Result:** The left-handed trefoil produces the classes $[-P]$ and $[-Y]$, which are the same as the classes $[P]$ and $[Y]$ already found. No new elements are generated.\n\n**4. Figure-Eight Knot ($4_1$)**\n*   It is a known result from the theory of Dehn surgery that $S^3_{-1}(4_1)$ is homeomorphic to $\\Sigma(2,3,7)$, which is the manifold $Y$ we obtained from the trefoil knot. Thus, $[S^3_{-1}(4_1)] = [Y]$.\n*   The figure-eight knot is amphichiral, so $4_1 = -4_1$. Using the surgery formula for mirrored knots: $S^3_{+1}(4_1) = S^3_{+1}(-4_1) = -S^3_{-1}(4_1) = -Y$.\n*   The class generated is $[-Y]$. As established before, this is the same class as $[Y]$.\n*   Alternatively, we can note that $\\text{Arf}(4_1) = 1$, so the resulting manifolds also have Rohlin invariant 1 and represent elements of order 2.\n*   **Result:** The figure-eight knot produces the class $[Y]$ and $[-Y]=[Y]$. No new elements are generated.\n\n### Step 4: Count the Distinct Elements\nLet's consolidate the elements we have found from all knots with at most four crossings:\n1.  From the unknot: $[S^3]$ (the identity).\n2.  From the right-handed trefoil: $[P]$ (Poincaré sphere) and $[Y]$ ($\\Sigma(2,3,7)$).\n3.  From the left-handed trefoil: $[P]$ and $[Y]$.\n4.  From the figure-eight knot: $[Y]$.\n\nThe set of all distinct elements of the homology cobordism group that can be represented is $\\{[S^3], [P], [Y]\\}$.\n*   $[S^3]$ is distinct from the others (Rohlin invariant 0 vs 1).\n*   $[P]$ and $[Y]$ are distinct from each other (Furuta's theorem).\n\nTherefore, there are exactly 3 distinct elements."
