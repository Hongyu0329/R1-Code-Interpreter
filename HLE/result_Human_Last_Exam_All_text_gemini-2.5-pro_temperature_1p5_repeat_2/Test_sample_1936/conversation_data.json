    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the smallest number `n` such that there exists a set `G` of `n` elements with a binary operation `·` where `(G, ·)` is not a group.\n\n### **Step 1: Understand the Definition of a Group**\n\nA group is a pair `(G, ·)`, where `G` is a set and `·` is a binary operation on `G`. This structure must satisfy four fundamental axioms:\n\n1.  **Closure:** For any two elements `a` and `b` in `G`, the result `a · b` is also in `G`. (This is implicit in the definition of a binary operation on `G`).\n2.  **Associativity:** For any elements `a`, `b`, and `c` in `G`, the equation `(a · b) · c = a · (b · c)` holds.\n3.  **Identity Element:** There exists an element `e` in `G` such that for every element `a` in `G`, `e · a = a · e = a`.\n4.  **Inverse Element:** For each element `a` in `G`, there exists an element `b` in `G` (the inverse of `a`, often denoted `a⁻¹`) such that `a · b = b · a = e`, where `e` is the identity element.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Potential Values of n, Starting from the Smallest**\n\nWe are looking for the smallest `n` for which we can define an operation `·` on a set `G` with `n` elements such that at least one of these axioms fails.\n\n**Careful Point 1: The case of n = 0 (The Empty Set)**\nLet `G` be the empty set, `G = ∅`.\nA binary operation is a function from `G × G` to `G`. Here, `G × G` is also the empty set. There is exactly one function from the empty set to the empty set (the \"empty function\"), so a binary operation can be defined.\n*   **Closure:** Satisfied by definition.\n*   **Associativity:** The condition \"for all a, b, c in G...\" is vacuously true because there are no elements in G.\n*   **Identity Element:** The axiom requires that \"there exists an element e in G...\". Since G is empty, no such element exists. This axiom fails.\nTherefore, `(∅, ·)` is not a group. This would make `n=0` the answer. However, the standard definition of a group in most modern algebra textbooks requires the set `G` to be **non-empty**. The existence of an identity element `e` *in* `G` inherently implies that `G` is not empty. We will follow this standard convention.\n\n**Conclusion for n=0:** Based on the standard (non-empty) definition of a group, `n=0` is not considered. We must look for `n ≥ 1`.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Analyze n = 1**\n\nLet `G` be a set with one element, say `G = {e}`.\n*   **Define the operation:** There is only one possible binary operation we can define on `G`. The operation must specify the result of `e · e`. For the closure property to hold, this result must be an element of `G`. Since `e` is the only element, we must define `e · e = e`.\n*   **Check the group axioms:**\n    1.  **Closure:** `e · e = e`, and `e` is in `G`. This holds.\n    2.  **Associativity:** We must check `(a · b) · c = a · (b · c)`. Since there's only one element, this becomes `(e · e) · e = e · (e · e)`.\n        *   Left side: `(e · e) · e = e · e = e`.\n        *   Right side: `e · (e · e) = e · e = e`.\n        The results are equal, so the operation is associative.\n    3.  **Identity Element:** We need an element `i` such that `i · e = e · i = e`. The element `e` itself works, since `e · e = e`. So, `e` is the identity element.\n    4.  **Inverse Element:** For the element `e`, we need an inverse `b` such that `e · b = e`. Choosing `b=e` gives `e · e = e`. So, the inverse of `e` is `e` itself.\n\nSince all four axioms are satisfied, any set of size 1 with a binary operation is a group (this is called the trivial group). It is impossible to construct a non-group structure with one element. Therefore, `n` must be greater than 1.\n\n---\n\n**Step 4: Analyze n = 2**\n\nLet `G` be a set with two elements, say `G = {a, b}`.\nOur goal is to define a binary operation `·` on `G` such that `(G, ·)` is *not* a group. We only need to find one such example. Let's try to define an operation that violates one of the axioms.\n\n**Example Construction:**\nLet's define the operation `·` such that for any two elements `x` and `y` in `G`, the result is always `a`.\nThe operation can be represented by the following Cayley table:\n\n| · | a | b |\n|---|---|---|\n| a | a | a |\n| b | a | a |\n\n**Check the group axioms for this structure:**\n1.  **Closure:** All results in the table are `a`, which is an element of `G = {a, b}`. So, the closure property holds.\n2.  **Associativity:** `(x · y) · z` is always `a · z`, which is `a`. `x · (y · z)` is always `x · a`, which is `a`. So associativity holds.\n3.  **Identity Element:** Let's check if there is an identity element `e`.\n    *   Could `a` be the identity? No. For `a` to be the identity, it must satisfy `a · b = b`. But from our table, `a · b = a`.\n    *   Could `b` be the identity? No. For `b` to be the identity, it must satisfy `b · a = a` (which holds) and `b · b = b`. But from our table, `b · b = a`.\n    Since neither element can serve as the identity, the identity axiom fails.\n\n**Conclusion for n=2:** We have successfully constructed a set `G` with `n=2` elements and a binary operation `·` such that `(G, ·)` is not a group.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\n*   For `n=1`, any structure `(G, ·)` must be a group.\n*   For `n=2`, we found an example of a structure `(G, ·)` that is not a group.\n\nTherefore, the smallest number `n` for which such a set exists is 2.\n\n<<<2>>>"
