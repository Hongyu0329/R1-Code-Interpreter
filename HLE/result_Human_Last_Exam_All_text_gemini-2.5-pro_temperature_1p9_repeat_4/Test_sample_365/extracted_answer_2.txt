The product is a bicyclic ketone with a bicyclo[7.3.1]tridecane skeleton. The ketone group is formed at the C2 position of the original norbornene ring. A new carbon-carbon double bond is formed between the original C1 and C6 atoms. The dimethoxy ketal at C7 and the TBDMS ether on the five-membered ring portion remain intact.
