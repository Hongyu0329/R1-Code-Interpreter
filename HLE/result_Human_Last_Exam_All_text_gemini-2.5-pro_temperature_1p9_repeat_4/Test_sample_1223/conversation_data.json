    "Answering this question requires combining several key results from continuum theory. Here is a step-by-step analysis.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the problem and define the terms\nFirst, let's understand the components of the question.\n*   **Metric Continuum:** A compact, connected, non-empty metric space.\n*   **Indecomposable Continuum:** A continuum that cannot be written as the union of two of its proper subcontinua.\n*   **Hereditarily Indecomposable Continuum:** A continuum where every non-degenerate subcontinuum is indecomposable. This is a very strong condition; the famous pseudo-arc is a prime example.\n*   **Composant:** For a point `p` in an indecomposable continuum `Y`, its composant is the set of all points `q` in `Y` such that there exists a proper subcontinuum of `Y` containing both `p` and `q`. The collection of all a continuum's a partition of the space.\n*   **Stone-Cech Compactification and Remainder:** For a locally compact, non-compact space `Z`, its Stone-Cech compactification is a compact space `βZ` containing `Z` as a dense subspace, satisfying a universal mapping property. The Stone-Cech remainder is the set `βZ \\ Z`. In our case, `Z = X \\ {x}`.\n\nThe question asks for the maximum possible number of composants of the Stone-Cech remainder of `X \\ {x}`.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the properties of `X` and `X \\ {x}`\nLet `X` be a hereditarily indecomposable metric continuum. A crucial property of any indecomposable continuum is that it contains no cut-points.\n*   A **cut-point** of a connected space `S` is a point `p` such that `S \\ {p}` is disconnected.\n*   Since `X` is indecomposable (as it is hereditarily indecomposable), it has no cut-points.\n*   This implies that for any point `x` in `X`, the space `X \\ {x}` is connected.\n*   Also, since `X` is a non-degenerate continuum (a standard assumption, otherwise `X` is a point and `X \\ {x}` is empty), `X \\ {x}` is a non-compact, locally compact, and connected metric space.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the topological nature of the remainder\nLet `R` be the Stone-Cech remainder of `X \\ {x}`, i.e., `R = β(X \\ {x}) \\ (X \\ {x})`. We need to understand the structure of `R`.\n*   A significant theorem in the study of remainders of continua (due to D.P. Bellamy, building on work by H. Cook) provides the answer. The theorem states: **If `M` is a continuum and `p ∈ M` is a point such that `M \\ {p}` is connected, then the remainder `β(M \\ {p}) \\ (M \\ {p})` is an indecomposable continuum.**\n*   We can apply this theorem directly to our situation. We take our continuum `M` to be `X` and the point `p` to be `x`.\n*   As established in Step 2, `X \\ {x}` is connected because `X` is indecomposable and has no cut-points.\n*   Therefore, the remainder `R` is an indecomposable continuum.\n\n*Careful point:* The condition that `X` is hereditarily indecomposable is stronger than what is needed for this step (indecomposable is sufficient). In fact, a stronger version of the theorem states that if `X` is hereditarily indecomposable, then the remainder `R` is also hereditarily indecomposable. This, however, does not change the final count of composants.\n\n### Step 4: Count the composants of the remainder `R`\nNow that we know `R` is an indecomposable continuum, we can determine its number of composants.\n*   A fundamental theorem in continuum theory states that **every non-degenerate indecomposable continuum has exactly `c` (the cardinality of the continuum, `2^ℵ₀`) distinct composants.**\n*   The remainder `R` is non-degenerate because `X \\ {x}` is non-compact.\n*   Therefore, the indecomposable continuum `R` has exactly `c` composants.\n\n### Step 5: Conclude the maximum possible number\nThe analysis in the preceding steps shows that for *any* non-degenerate hereditarily indecomposable metric continuum `X` and any point `x` in it, the number of composants of the remainder of `X \\ {x}` is always `c`. Since this number is constant for all such continua, the maximum possible value is this constant.\n\nFinal Conclusion: The number of composants is invariably `c = 2^ℵ₀`."
