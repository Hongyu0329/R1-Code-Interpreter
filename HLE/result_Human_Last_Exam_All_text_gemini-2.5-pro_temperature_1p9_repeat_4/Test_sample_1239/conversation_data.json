    "An analysis of the Lie group of symmetries for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations requires identifying all continuous transformations that leave the equations invariant. Here is a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n### Step 1: State the Equations\nThe incompressible Navier-Stokes equations for a fluid with velocity $\\mathbf{u}(t, \\mathbf{x})$ and pressure $p(t, \\mathbf{x})$ in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ are given by:\n1.  **Momentum Equation:** $\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}}{\\partial t} + (\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla) \\mathbf{u} = -\\nabla p + \\nu \\Delta \\mathbf{u}$\n2.  **Incompressibility Condition:** $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u} = 0$\n\nHere, $\\nu$ is the constant kinematic viscosity. We look for one-parameter groups of transformations $(t, \\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{u}, p) \\to (t', \\mathbf{x}', \\mathbf{u}', p')$ that map solutions to other solutions. The dimension of the Lie group is the number of independent parameters for these transformations, which is equivalent to the dimension of the Lie algebra of infinitesimal generators.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Symmetries and Count Their Generators\nThe symmetries can be categorized into several types.\n\n**1. Galilean Symmetries (10 generators)**\nThese are the fundamental symmetries of classical mechanics and are inherited by the Navier-Stokes equations.\n\n*   **Time Translation (1 generator):** The equations are autonomous (no explicit dependence on $t$).\n    *   Transformation: $t' = t + s$\n    *   Dimension: 1\n\n*   **Space Translations (3 generators):** The equations are homogeneous in space (no explicit dependence on $\\mathbf{x}$).\n    *   Transformation: $\\mathbf{x}' = \\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{a}$\n    *   Dimension: 3 (for the three components of the vector $\\mathbf{a}$)\n\n*   **Spatial Rotations (3 generators):** The equations are isotropic (invariant under rotations).\n    *   Transformation: $\\mathbf{x}' = R\\mathbf{x}$, $\\mathbf{u}' = R\\mathbf{u}$ (where $R \\in SO(3)$ is a rotation matrix).\n    *   The Lie group $SO(3)$ has dimension 3.\n\n*   **Galilean Boosts (3 generators):** The equations are invariant under a change to a uniformly moving reference frame.\n    *   Transformation: $\\mathbf{x}' = \\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{v}_0 t$, $\\mathbf{u}' = \\mathbf{u} + \\mathbf{v}_0$.\n    *   Dimension: 3 (for the three components of the boost velocity $\\mathbf{v}_0$).\n\nAdding these up, the Galilean symmetries contribute $1 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 10$ dimensions to the Lie algebra.\n\n**2. Scaling Symmetry (1 generator)**\nBeyond the Galilean symmetries, the Navier-Stokes equations possess a scaling symmetry due to the balance between the different terms.\n\n*   **Transformation:** This is found by seeking constants $a, b, c, d$ such that the transformation $t \\to \\lambda^a t$, $\\mathbf{x} \\to \\lambda^b \\mathbf{x}$, $\\mathbf{u} \\to \\lambda^c \\mathbf{u}$, $p \\to \\lambda^d p$ leaves the equations invariant for any $\\lambda > 0$. Analysis of the scaling of each term in the momentum equation leads to the unique relations: $a=2, b=1, c=-1, d=-2$.\n    *   Transformation: $t' = \\lambda^2 t, \\mathbf{x}' = \\lambda \\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{u}' = \\lambda^{-1} \\mathbf{u}, p' = \\lambda^{-2} p$.\n    *   This is a one-parameter family of transformations (parameter $\\lambda$).\n    *   Dimension: 1\n\n**3. Pressure Shift Symmetry (Infinite-dimensional algebra)**\nThe pressure $p$ only appears through its gradient $\\nabla p$ in the momentum equation. This leads to an additional symmetry.\n\n*   **Transformation:** $p' = p + g(t)$, where $g(t)$ is any arbitrary smooth function of time.\n*   Since $\\nabla g(t) = 0$, this transformation leaves the momentum equation unchanged. The velocity field is not affected, so the incompressibility condition is also trivially satisfied.\n*   Because $g(t)$ is an arbitrary function, it can be represented by an infinite number of basis functions (e.g., $t^n$ for $n=0, 1, 2, ...$). This implies that there are infinitely many independent generators, of the form $g(t) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p}$.\n*   Dimension: $\\infty$\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Final Dimension\nThe full Lie algebra of symmetries is the combination of all the generators found above. The presence of the pressure shift symmetry makes the full symmetry algebra infinite-dimensional.\n\nHowever, the infinite-dimensional part forms an ideal in the algebra and corresponds to a \"gauge-like\" symmetry on the pressure field, which does not affect the spatio-temporal coordinates $(t, \\mathbf{x})$ or the velocity field $\\mathbf{u}$. In such cases, it is standard practice to characterize the group by the dimension of its maximal *finite-dimensional* subalgebra that involves transformations of the physical spacetime and velocity variables.\n\nThe dimension of this finite-dimensional symmetry group is the sum of the dimensions from the Galilean symmetries and the scaling symmetry.\n\nTotal Dimension = (Time translation) + (Space translations) + (Rotations) + (Galilean boosts) + (Scaling)\nTotal Dimension = 1 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 11\n\nThus, the Lie group of symmetries of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ is an 11-dimensional group extended by an infinite-dimensional ideal. The question \"What is the dimension\" is conventionally understood to refer to the dimension of the finite part.\n\n<<<11>>>"
