The partition function depends on whether the particles are bosons or fermions.

For a system of fermions, the partition function Z is:
$Z_F = 1 + e^{\beta\mu}$

For a system of bosons, the partition function Z is:
$Z_B = \frac{1}{1 - e^{\beta\mu}}$
(This result is valid under the physical condition that the chemical potential $\mu$ is less than the ground state energy, which is 0 in this case, i.e., $\mu < 0$).
