    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the partition function.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Define the Grand Canonical Partition Function:**\n    The grand canonical partition function, Z, for a quantum system is defined by the trace over the Hilbert space of the exponential of the grand canonical Hamiltonian operator:\n    $Z = \\text{Tr}\\left[ e^{-\\beta(\\hat{H}_{\\text{sys}} - \\mu \\hat{N})} \\right]$\n    Here, $\\beta = 1/(k_B T)$ is the inverse temperature, $\\hat{H}_{\\text{sys}}$ is the system's Hamiltonian operator (representing its internal energy), $\\mu$ is the chemical potential, and $\\hat{N}$ is the particle number operator.\n\n2.  **Interpret the Hamiltonian in the Question:**\n    The question specifies a \"Hamiltonian $\\hat{H} = -\\mu\\hat{N}$\". This phrasing is slightly ambiguous. There are two main interpretations:\n    a) The system's intrinsic Hamiltonian is literally $\\hat{H}_{\\text{sys}} = -\\mu \\hat{N}$. This would be an unusual physical system where the energy depends on the chemical potential of the reservoir it's connected to. In this case, the operator in the exponent would be $\\hat{H}_{\\text{sys}} - \\mu\\hat{N} = -\\mu\\hat{N} - \\mu\\hat{N} = -2\\mu\\hat{N}$.\n    b) The question is using a common shorthand where the term \"Hamiltonian\" refers to the entire operator in the grand canonical exponent. That is, $\\hat{H}_{\\text{sys}} - \\mu\\hat{N} \\equiv -\\mu\\hat{N}$. This implies that the system's intrinsic Hamiltonian $\\hat{H}_{\\text{sys}}$ is zero. This corresponds to a standard model of non-interacting particles where all accessible single-particle energy levels are at zero energy ($\\epsilon=0$).\n\n    Interpretation (b) represents a more standard and fundamental physical model used in many areas of statistical and condensed matter physics. We will proceed with this interpretation as it is the most likely intended meaning.\n\n    Under this interpretation, the partition function we need to calculate is:\n    $Z = \\text{Tr}\\left[ e^{-\\beta(-\\mu \\hat{N})} \\right] = \\text{Tr}\\left[ e^{\\beta\\mu \\hat{N}} \\right]$\n\n3.  **Formulate the Path Integral:**\n    The trace can be expressed as a functional path integral in imaginary time, $\\tau$. The form of the integral depends on the statistics of the particles (Bosons or Fermions).\n    $Z = \\int \\mathcal{D}[\\psi^*, \\psi] e^{-S[\\psi^*, \\psi]}$\n    The action $S$ is derived from the operator in the exponent. For the operator $\\hat{K} = -\\mu\\hat{N} = \\int d^d x \\psi^*(x)(-\\mu)\\psi(x)$, the corresponding Euclidean action is:\n    $S[\\psi^*, \\psi] = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d x \\, \\psi^*(x, \\tau) (\\partial_\\tau - \\mu) \\psi(x, \\tau)$\n    Here, we assume the system consists of a set of single-particle states, and we focus on the contribution from a single such state (since they are all identical with $\\epsilon=0$, we can later generalize by taking a product). For a single state, we can drop the spatial integral.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Path Integral for Fermions and Bosons:**\n    The path integral is a Gaussian integral over the fields $\\psi$. Its value depends on the determinant of the operator in the action and the nature of the fields.\n\n    *   **Careful Point 1: Particle Statistics.** We must treat Fermions and Bosons separately.\n        *   **Fermions:** The fields $\\psi, \\psi^*$ are anti-commuting Grassmann numbers. The path integral evaluates to $Z_F = \\det(\\partial_\\tau - \\mu)$. The fields obey anti-periodic boundary conditions in imaginary time: $\\psi(\\tau+\\beta) = -\\psi(\\tau)$.\n        *   **Bosons:** The fields $\\psi, \\psi^*$ are standard complex numbers. The path integral evaluates to $Z_B = [\\det(\\partial_\\tau - \\mu)]^{-1}$. The fields obey periodic boundary conditions: $\\psi(\\tau+\\beta) = \\psi(\\tau)$.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Functional Determinant:**\n    To calculate the determinant, we find the eigenvalues of the operator $\\partial_\\tau - \\mu$. We do this by working in the Fourier basis (Matsubara frequency basis), where the operator $\\partial_\\tau$ is diagonal.\n\n    *   **Careful Point 2: Matsubara Frequencies.** The allowed frequencies depend on the boundary conditions.\n        *   **Fermions (anti-periodic):** The fermionic Matsubara frequencies are $\\omega_n = \\frac{(2n+1)\\pi}{\\beta}$ for $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n        *   **Bosons (periodic):** The bosonic Matsubara frequencies are $\\omega_n = \\frac{2n\\pi}{\\beta}$ for $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n    In this basis, the operator $\\partial_\\tau - \\mu$ is diagonal with eigenvalues $-i\\omega_n - \\mu$.\n\n    *   **Fermion Case:**\n        $Z_F = \\det(\\partial_\\tau - \\mu) = \\prod_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty}(-i\\omega_n - \\mu)$\n        This infinite product can be formally evaluated. Using the identity $\\prod_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} [ (2n+1)\\pi y - ix ] = 2\\cosh(\\frac{x}{2y})$, or by integrating the derivative $\\frac{\\partial \\ln Z}{\\partial\\mu}$, one finds:\n        $\\ln Z_F = \\ln(1+e^{\\beta\\mu})$\n        $Z_F = 1 + e^{\\beta\\mu}$\n\n    *   **Boson Case:**\n        $Z_B = [\\det(\\partial_\\tau - \\mu)]^{-1} = \\left[\\prod_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty}(-i\\omega_n - \\mu)\\right]^{-1}$\n        A similar evaluation (or using identities like $\\prod_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} [ 2n\\pi y - ix ] = 2\\sinh(\\frac{x}{2y})$) yields:\n        $\\ln Z_B = -\\ln(1 - e^{\\beta\\mu})$\n        $Z_B = \\frac{1}{1 - e^{\\beta\\mu}}$\n\n    *   **Careful Point 3: Condition for Bosons.** For the bosonic partition function to be well-defined and the geometric series in the standard operator derivation to converge, the grand potential must be bounded. This requires the argument of the logarithm to be positive, $1 - e^{\\beta\\mu} > 0$, which implies $e^{\\beta\\mu} < 1$, or $\\mu < 0$. This ensures the occupation of the zero-energy state does not diverge.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nThe analysis shows that for a single quantum state with zero energy, the grand canonical partition function derived using the path integral method is:\n*   For a system of **Fermions**: $Z_F = 1 + e^{\\beta\\mu}$\n*   For a system of **Bosons**: $Z_B = \\frac{1}{1 - e^{\\beta\\mu}}$, under the condition that $\\mu < 0$.\n\nIf the system consists of M non-interacting, degenerate states all at zero energy, the total partition function is simply the product of the single-state partition functions: $Z_{total} = (Z_{single-state})^M$. The question asks for \"the\" partition function, which typically refers to the fundamental result for a single mode or degree of freedom.\n\nThe final result can be presented separately for the two types of particle statistics.\n\nFor Fermions:\n$Z = 1 + e^{\\beta\\mu}$\n\nFor Bosons:\n$Z = \\frac{1}{1 - e^{\\beta\\mu}}$ (valid for $\\mu < 0$)\n\n<<<\nThe partition function depends on whether the particles are bosons or fermions.\n\nFor a system of fermions, the partition function Z is:\n$Z_F = 1 + e^{\\beta\\mu}$\n\nFor a system of bosons, the partition function Z is:\n$Z_B = \\frac{1}{1 - e^{\\beta\\mu}}$\n(This result is valid under the physical condition that the chemical potential $\\mu$ is less than the ground state energy, which is 0 in this case, i.e., $\\mu < 0$).\n>>>"
