    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understanding the question:** The goal is to find the total number of distinct $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori in a reductive group $G$ of type $E_8$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$. This is about conjugacy classes of such tori.\n\n2.  **The Correspondence Principle:** A fundamental theorem in the theory of reductive groups over finite fields, established by Steinberg, provides a one-to-one correspondence between the set of $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$-conjugacy classes of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of $G$ and the set of $F$-conjugacy classes of the Weyl group $W$ of $G$.\n\n3.  **Defining F-conjugacy:** An $F$-conjugacy class in the Weyl group $W$ is a set of the form $\\{x w F(x)^{-1} \\mid x \\in W\\}$ for some fixed $w \\in W$. Here, $F$ denotes the action on $W$ induced by the Frobenius endomorphism of the group $G$.\n\n4.  **Determining the Frobenius action on the Weyl group $W(E_8)$:** The action of the Frobenius endomorphism $F$ on the Weyl group $W$ is determined by the action of the Galois group Gal($\\bar{\\mathbb{F}}_q$/$\\mathbb{F}_q$) on the Dynkin diagram of the root system of $G$. The group $G$ is of type $E_8$. Let's examine its Dynkin diagram:\n    ```\n       o---o---o---o---o---o---o\n               |\n               o\n    ```\n    This diagram has a trivial automorphism group. That is, there are no non-trivial symmetries.\n\n5.  **Implication of trivial diagram automorphism:** Because the Dynkin diagram of type $E_8$ has no non-trivial automorphisms, any quasi-split group of type $E_8$ over any field is in fact a split group. The Frobenius map $F$ must therefore act trivially on the basis of simple roots and, consequently, on the entire root system and the Weyl group. This means $F(w) = w$ for all $w \\in W(E_8)$.\n\n6.  **Simplifying F-conjugacy to standard conjugacy:** With the trivial action of $F$, the definition of an $F$-conjugacy class becomes:\n    $\\{x w F(x)^{-1} \\mid x \\in W\\} = \\{x w w^{-1} \\mid x \\in W\\}$ -- Wait, that is incorrect.\n    $\\{x w F(x)^{-1} \\mid x \\in W\\} = \\{x w x^{-1} \\mid x \\in W\\}$, since $F(x)=x$.\n    This is the definition of a standard conjugacy class in the group $W$.\n\n7.  **Reducing the problem:** The problem is now reduced to finding the number of conjugacy classes in the Weyl group of type $E_8$, denoted $W(E_8)$.\n\n8.  **Finding the number of conjugacy classes of $W(E_8)$:** The structure of the Weyl groups of exceptional Lie types is a classical topic. The number of conjugacy classes for each exceptional Weyl group has been computed. For the Weyl group $W(E_8)$, this number was determined by R.W. Carter in his 1972 paper \"Conjugacy classes in the Weyl group\".\n\n9.  **The Result:** According to Carter's classification (and confirmed by many subsequent resources, including computational algebra systems like GAP), the Weyl group $W(E_8)$ has exactly **112** conjugacy classes.\n\n10. **Conclusion:** Since the number of $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$-conjugacy classes of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori is equal to the number of conjugacy classes of $W(E_8)$, the answer is 112. It's important to note that this number is independent of the choice of the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   It is crucial to correctly identify the correspondence between tori and Weyl group classes.\n*   One must correctly determine the action of the Frobenius map on the Weyl group. For $E_8$, this is trivial due to the lack of symmetry in its Dynkin diagram.\n*   The definition of $F$-conjugacy must be correctly simplified under the trivial action. It becomes ordinary conjugacy.\n*   The final number relies on a known, non-trivial result from the classification of reflection groups. It is not something typically derived from first principles in a standard context.\n\nFinal Answer Derivation:\nThe number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori (up to $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$-conjugacy) is the number of $F$-conjugacy classes in $W(E_8)$. The action of $F$ on $W(E_8)$ is trivial. Therefore, the number required is the number of ordinary conjugacy classes in $W(E_8)$. This is a known value.\n\nFinal answer is 112.\n\n<<<112>>>"
