    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the smallest possible number of isometric embeddings of a finite ultrametric space $X$ in a Banach space $B$ of cardinality $K$.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Definitions\n*   **Finite Ultrametric Space (X):** A finite set $X$ with a metric $d$ satisfying the strong triangle inequality: for all $x, y, z \\in X$, $d(x, z) \\leq \\max(d(x, y), d(y, z))$.\n*   **Banach Space (B):** A complete normed vector space. The problem specifies its cardinality is $K$. A Banach space can be defined over any complete valued field, not just $\\mathbb{R}$ or $\\mathbb{C}$.\n*   **Isometric Embedding:** A function $f: X \\to B$ such that for all $x_1, x_2 \\in X$, $\\|f(x_1) - f(x_2)\\|_B = d(x_1, x_2)$.\n*   **The Question:** We want to find the minimum value for the number of such embeddings, across all possible choices of $X$ and $B$. Let this number be $N(X, B)$. We are looking for $\\min_{X,B} N(X,B)$. A reasonable interpretation is that we are looking for the minimum non-zero value, i.e., $\\min \\{N(X, B) \\mid N(X,B) > 0\\}$.\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing the Number of Embeddings from a Single One\nSuppose there exists at least one isometric embedding $f: X \\to B$. We can use this to construct other embeddings.\nLet $v$ be any vector in the Banach space $B$. Define a new function $f_v: X \\to B$ by $f_v(x) = f(x) + v$. This corresponds to a translation of the image of $X$ in $B$.\nLet's check if $f_v$ is an isometric embedding:\n$\\|f_v(x_1) - f_v(x_2)\\|_B = \\|(f(x_1) + v) - (f(x_2) + v)\\|_B = \\|f(x_1) - f(x_2)\\|_B = d(x_1, x_2)$.\nYes, $f_v$ is also an isometric embedding.\nIf $v_1 \\neq v_2$, then $f_{v_1}$ and $f_{v_2}$ are different functions. Thus, if there is one embedding, there are at least $|B| = K$ embeddings.\n\nThis suggests that the number of embeddings is at least $K$. To find the smallest possible number of embeddings, we should seek to make $K$ as small as possible.\n\n### Step 3: Finding a Banach Space with Small Cardinality\nThe cardinality $K$ of a Banach space depends on the underlying field.\n*   If the field is $\\mathbb{R}$ or $\\mathbb{C}$, any non-zero Banach space has cardinality at least $c = 2^{\\aleph_0}$ (the cardinality of the continuum). In this case, the number of embeddings would be at least $c$, which is not a finite number.\n*   This suggests we should consider Banach spaces over other fields, or the zero Banach space.\n\nLet's consider the simplest possible Banach space: the zero space $B = \\{0\\}$.\n*   **Is $\\{0\\}$ a Banach space?** Yes. It is a vector space over any field. Its norm is defined by $\\|0\\|=0$. It is complete because the only Cauchy sequence is the constant sequence $(0, 0, \\ldots)$, which converges to 0.\n*   The cardinality of this space is $K=1$.\n\n### Step 4: Finding an Ultrametric Space that can be embedded in $B = \\{0\\}$\nFor a space $X$ to be isometrically embeddable in $B=\\{0\\}$, for any $x_1, x_2 \\in X$, we must have:\n$d(x_1, x_2) = \\|f(x_1) - f(x_2)\\|_B$.\nSince the only element in $B$ is 0, any map $f: X \\to B$ must be the constant map $f(x)=0$ for all $x \\in X$.\nThus, we need $d(x_1, x_2) = \\|0-0\\| = 0$ for all $x_1, x_2 \\in X$. This implies that all points in $X$ are the same, so $X$ can have only one point.\n\nLet's choose the simplest possible finite ultrametric space: a single-point space $X = \\{x_0\\}$.\n*   **Is $X=\\{x_0\\}$ a finite ultrametric space?** Yes. It's finite. Its metric is given by $d(x_0, x_0)=0$. The strong triangle inequality holds trivially.\n\n### Step 5: Calculating the Number of Embeddings for this Case\nLet's consider the pair $(X, B)$ where $X = \\{x_0\\}$ and $B = \\{0\\}$.\nWe are looking for the number of isometric embeddings $f: X \\to B$.\n1.  **Existence:** There is only one possible function, $f(x_0) = 0$. Let's check if it's an isometric embedding. We need to check the condition for all pairs of points, which is just the pair $(x_0, x_0)$:\n    $d(x_0, x_0) = 0$.\n    $\\|f(x_0) - f(x_0)\\|_B = \\|0 - 0\\|_B = 0$.\n    Since $0=0$, the condition holds. So, an isometric embedding exists.\n2.  **Uniqueness:** As there is only one possible function from a one-point set to a one-point set, this embedding is unique.\n\nSo, for $X = \\{x_0\\}$ and $B = \\{0\\}$, there is exactly 1 isometric embedding.\n\n### Step 6: Final Conclusion\nWe have found a valid pair of a finite ultrametric space $X$ and a Banach space $B$ for which the number of isometric embeddings is 1. Since the question asks for the smallest *possible* number (and this number must be a non-negative integer), and we are considering cases where embeddings exist (so the number is at least 1), the minimum possible value is 1.\n\nTo be thorough, let's consider if we disallow these \"trivial\" cases ($|X|=1, B=\\{0\\}$).\nIf $|X| \\ge 2$, we require distances to be non-zero, so $B \\ne \\{0\\}$. We need to find a Banach space with the smallest possible non-zero cardinality. This leads to considering spaces over finite fields.\nLet $B = \\mathbb{F}_2 = \\{0, 1\\}$ be the field with two elements. We can define a norm on it using the trivial valuation on $\\mathbb{F}_2$: $\\|0\\|=0, \\|1\\|=1$. This is a Banach space of cardinality $K=2$.\nThe distances between points in this space can only be 0 or 1.\nLet's choose a simple two-point ultrametric space $X=\\{x_0, x_1\\}$ with $d(x_0, x_1)=1$.\nAn isometric embedding $f:X \\to B$ must satisfy $\\|f(x_0)-f(x_1)\\|=1$.\nThe possible mappings are:\n*   $f(x_0)=0, f(x_1)=0 \\implies \\|0-0\\|=0 \\ne 1$. No.\n*   $f(x_0)=0, f(x_1)=1 \\implies \\|0-1\\|=\\|1\\|=1$. Yes.\n*   $f(x_0)=1, f(x_1)=0 \\implies \\|1-0\\|=\\|1\\|=1$. Yes.\n*   $f(x_0)=1, f(x_1)=1 \\implies \\|1-1\\|=0 \\ne 1$. No.\nThere are exactly 2 isometric embeddings in this case.\n\nComparing the results, 1 is smaller than 2. Since the problem as stated does not provide any constraints to exclude the single-point space or the zero Banach space, the formal definitions must be used. Based on these definitions, the case yielding 1 embedding is valid."
