    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the first Academy Award Best Picture winner to depict a Luxor Obelisk.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Luxor Obelisks and their locations.**\nThere are two Luxor Obelisks, which were originally part of the Luxor Temple in Egypt.\n*   One obelisk remains at the entrance to the Luxor Temple in Luxor, Egypt.\n*   The second obelisk was moved to Paris in the 1830s and now stands in the center of the Place de la Concorde in Paris, France.\nTherefore, the search must include films that depict either of these two specific locations.\n\n**Step 2: Chronologically review Best Picture winners for relevant settings.**\nWe will go through the list of Best Picture winners from the first ceremony and look for films set in either Paris, France, or Luxor, Egypt.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze potential candidates.**\n\n*   **1st Awards (1927/1928): *Wings***\n    *   **Analysis:** This World War I film features scenes where characters are on leave in Paris. However, these scenes focus on interiors like restaurants and hotel rooms and do not prominently feature major city landmarks. There is no clear, confirmed depiction of the Place de la Concorde or its obelisk.\n\n*   **10th Awards (1937): *The Life of Emile Zola***\n    *   **Analysis:** The film is set in Paris during the late 19th century, covering the Dreyfus Affair. While the setting is correct and the obelisk was in the Place de la Concorde at the time, the film's focus is on interiors (courtrooms, offices, homes) and close-up human drama. A thorough review of the film does not reveal any clear establishing shots or scenes that depict the Place de la Concorde or the obelisk.\n\n*   **16th Awards (1943): *Casablanca***\n    *   **Analysis:** This film features flashbacks to Paris. However, these scenes are intimate and focused on the lead characters' romance. The famous opening montage showing the refugee trail from Paris includes the Arc de Triomphe, but not the Place de la Concorde.\n\n*   **24th Awards (1951): *An American in Paris***\n    *   **Analysis:** The film is set entirely in Paris and is famous for its visual celebration of the city. In the film's climactic 17-minute ballet sequence, the main character dreams his way through various Parisian settings designed in the style of famous French painters. One of these major set pieces is a representation of the Place de la Concorde, with the Luxor Obelisk featured prominently at its center. This is a clear and intentional depiction.\n\n*   **29th Awards (1956): *Around the World in 80 Days***\n    *   **Analysis:** In the early part of the film, Phileas Fogg's journey takes him over Paris in a hot air balloon. During this sequence, there are aerial views of the city, which include a clear shot of the Place de la Concorde and its obelisk. However, this film won five years after *An American in Paris*.\n\n*   **Analysis of films set in Egypt:**\n    *   Epics like *The Ten Commandments* (1956) or *Cleopatra* (1963) featured ancient Egypt, but neither won Best Picture. The first Best Picture winner to be filmed on location in Egypt and depict the Karnak/Luxor temple complex was *Death on the Nile* (1978), but that film was not a Best Picture winner; *The Deer Hunter* won that year.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude the findings.**\nGoing chronologically through the list of winners, the first film with a confirmed, clear, and prominent on-screen depiction of a Luxor Obelisk (the one in Paris) is *An American in Paris*, which won the Academy Award for Best Picture for the year 1951.\n\n<<<An American in Paris>>>"
