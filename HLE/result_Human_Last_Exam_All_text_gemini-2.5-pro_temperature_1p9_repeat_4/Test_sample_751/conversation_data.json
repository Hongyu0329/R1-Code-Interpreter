    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to reduce the given discrete-time system to observer canonical form using duality.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Problem and Duality Principle**\n\nWe are given a discrete-time system:\nx(k+1) = A * x(k)\ny(k) = C * x(k)\nwith:\nA = [[1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 1], [0, 2, 0]]\nC = [[0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0]]\n\nThe goal is to find the observer canonical form for this system. The duality principle allows us to solve this by finding the controller canonical form for the dual system.\n\nThe dual system is defined by (A_d, B_d), where:\nA_d = A^T\nB_d = C^T\n\nThe transformation to observer canonical form for the original system (A, C) is related to the transformation to controller canonical form for the dual system (A_d, B_d). Let the transformation matrix for the dual system be P. Then the transformed matrices for the original system are:\nA_obs = T * A * T^(-1)\nC_obs = C * T^(-1)\nwhere T = (P^(-1))^T, which implies T^(-1) = P^T.\nTherefore, C_obs = C * P^T. Our main goal is to find this matrix P.\n\n**Step 2: Define the Dual System and Check Controllability**\n\nFirst, we find the matrices for the dual system:\nA_d = A^T = [[1, 2, 0], [1, 1, 2], [0, 1, 0]]\nB_d = C^T = [[0, 1], [1, 1], [0, 0]]\n\nThe dual system is a multi-input system. To use the standard single-input controller canonical form procedure, we must select one input column from B_d that makes the system (A_d, b_d) controllable. Let's choose the first column of B_d, which corresponds to the first output of the original system.\nb_d = [0, 1, 0]^T\n\nWe check the controllability of the pair (A_d, b_d) by computing the rank of the controllability matrix Wc_d = [b_d, A_d*b_d, A_d^2*b_d].\nA_d*b_d = [[1, 2, 0], [1, 1, 2], [0, 1, 0]] * [0, 1, 0]^T = [2, 1, 1]^T\nA_d^2*b_d = A_d * [2, 1, 1]^T = [[1, 2, 0], [1, 1, 2], [0, 1, 0]] * [2, 1, 1]^T = [4, 5, 1]^T\nWc_d = [[0, 2, 4], [1, 1, 5], [0, 1, 1]]\n\nThe determinant of Wc_d is det(Wc_d) = 0 - 2*(1*1 - 5*0) + 4*(1*1 - 1*0) = -2 + 4 = 2.\nSince det(Wc_d) is non-zero, the rank is 3, and the pair (A_d, b_d) is controllable.\n\n**Step 3: Find the Transformation Matrix P for the Dual System**\n\nWe need to transform (A_d, b_d) to a controller canonical form (A_c, b_c).\nFirst, we find the characteristic polynomial of A_d:\np(λ) = det(λI - A_d) = det([[λ-1, -2, 0], [-1, λ-1, -2], [0, -1, λ]])\n     = (λ-1)(λ(λ-1) - 2) - (-2)(-λ)\n     = λ^3 - 2λ^2 - 3λ + 2\nSo, the coefficients are a_1 = -2, a_2 = -3, a_3 = 2.\n\nWe choose a controller canonical form. A common choice is:\nA_c = [[-a_1, -a_2, -a_3], [1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0]] = [[2, 3, -2], [1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0]]\nThe corresponding input vector is b_c = [1, 0, 0]^T.\n\nThe transformation matrix P is given by P = Wc_c * (Wc_d)^(-1), where Wc_c is the controllability matrix of the canonical system.\nWc_c = [b_c, A_c*b_c, A_c^2*b_c]\nA_c*b_c = [2, 1, 0]^T\nA_c^2*b_c = A_c * [2, 1, 0]^T = [7, 2, 1]^T\nWc_c = [[1, 2, 7], [0, 1, 2], [0, 0, 1]]\n\nNext, we find the inverse of Wc_d:\n(Wc_d)^(-1) = (1/det(Wc_d)) * adj(Wc_d) = (1/2) * [[-4, 2, 6], [-1, 0, 4], [1, 0, -2]]\n\nNow we compute P:\nP = Wc_c * (Wc_d)^(-1)\n  = [[1, 2, 7], [0, 1, 2], [0, 0, 1]] * (1/2) * [[-4, 2, 6], [-1, 0, 4], [1, 0, -2]]\n  = (1/2) * [[-4-2+7, 2+0+0, 6+8-14], [-1+2, 0, 4-4], [1, 0, -2]]\n  = (1/2) * [[1, 2, 0], [1, 0, 0], [1, 0, -2]]\n\n**Step 4: Compute the new Matrix C_obs**\n\nThe new output matrix in the observer canonical form is given by C_obs = C * P^T.\nP^T = (1/2) * [[1, 1, 1], [2, 0, 0], [0, 0, -2]]\n\nC_obs = [[0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0]] * (1/2) * [[1, 1, 1], [2, 0, 0], [0, 0, -2]]\n      = (1/2) * [[0*1+1*2+0*0, 0*1+1*0+0*0, 0*1+1*0+0*(-2)], [1*1+1*2+0*0, 1*1+1*0+0*0, 1*1+1*0+0*(-2)]]\n      = (1/2) * [[2, 0, 0], [3, 1, 1]]\n      = [[1, 0, 0], [1.5, 0.5, 0.5]]\n\nThe new matrix C is C_obs.\n\nFinal check: The structure of the observer canonical form corresponding to our choice of A_c means that the first column of C_obs should be [1, 0]^T if we were transforming a single-output system. Since we used the first row of C to construct our transformation, the first row of the resulting C_obs should be [1, 0, 0]. Our result [[1, 0, 0], [1.5, 0.5, 0.5]] satisfies this.\n\n<<<[[1, 0, 0], [1.5, 0.5, 0.5]]>>>"
