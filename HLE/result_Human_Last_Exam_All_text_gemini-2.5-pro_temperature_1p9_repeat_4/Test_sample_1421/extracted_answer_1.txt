The formula for the fermionic partition function Z in the imaginary time representation using Feynman’s path integral formalism is:

$Z = \int_{\psi(\beta) = -\psi(0)} \mathcal{D}[\psi^*, \psi] \, e^{-S[\psi^*, \psi]}$

where:

*   **∫ D[ψ*, ψ]** represents the functional integral over all configurations of the independent Grassmann-valued fields ψ(τ) and ψ*(τ).
*   The subscript **ψ(β) = -ψ(0)** explicitly indicates that the integration is restricted to fields that obey **anti-periodic boundary conditions** over the imaginary time interval [0, β].
*   **S[ψ*, ψ]** is the Euclidean action for the fermionic system, given by:
    $S[\psi^*, \psi] = \int_0^\beta d\tau \left[ \sum_i \psi_i^*(\tau) \frac{\partial}{\partial \tau} \psi_i(\tau) + H(\psi^*, \psi) \right]$
*   **τ** is the imaginary time variable.
*   **β = 1/(k_B T)** is the inverse temperature.
*   The index **i** runs over all single-particle quantum numbers (e.g., momentum, spin).
*   **H(ψ*, ψ)** is the classical analog of the normal-ordered quantum Hamiltonian, where fermion creation operators (a†) are replaced by ψ* and annihilation operators (a) are replaced by ψ.
