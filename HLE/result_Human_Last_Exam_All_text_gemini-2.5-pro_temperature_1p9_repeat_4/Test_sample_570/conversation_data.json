    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the minimal area of the convex domain.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Condition on the Convex Domain\n\nLet `K` be a convex domain in the plane. The problem states that `K` must intersect every line with the equation `px + qy = 1`, where `p` and `q` are coprime integers (i.e., `gcd(p, q) = 1`).\n\nLet `v` be the vector `(p, q)`. The equation of the line can be written as `v · x = 1`, where `x = (x, y)`. Let `S` be the set of all such vectors `v`, which are the primitive integer lattice points (excluding the origin).\n\nFor a given line `L_v: v · x = 1`, if the convex set `K` does not intersect it, then `K` must lie entirely in one of the two open half-planes defined by `L_v`. That is, either `v · x > 1` for all `x ∈ K`, or `v · x < 1` for all `x ∈ K`.\n\nThe condition that `K` intersects every such line `L_v` means that for every `v ∈ S`:\n`K` is not contained in `{x | v · x > 1}` AND `K` is not contained in `{x | v · x < 1}`.\n\nThis is equivalent to:\n`inf_{x ∈ K} (v · x) ≤ 1` AND `sup_{x ∈ K} (v · x) ≥ 1`.\n\n### Step 2: Using the Support Function\n\nLet `h_K(v) = sup_{x ∈ K} (v · x)` be the support function of the convex set `K`. The support function is defined for any vector `v ∈ R^2`. The infimum can be expressed in terms of the support function as `inf_{x ∈ K} (v · x) = -sup_{x ∈ K} (-v · x) = -h_K(-v)`.\n\nSo, the condition on `K` can be rewritten in terms of its support function:\n`-h_K(-v) ≤ 1` and `h_K(v) ≥ 1` for all `v ∈ S`.\n\nThe first inequality is `h_K(-v) ≥ -1`.\nThe set `S` of primitive integer vectors is centrally symmetric: if `v = (p,q) ∈ S`, then `-v = (-p,-q) ∈ S` because `gcd(-p, -q) = gcd(p, q) = 1`.\n\nSo, if we take any `w ∈ S`, the condition `h_K(v) ≥ 1` for all `v ∈ S` implies `h_K(w) ≥ 1` and also `h_K(-w) ≥ 1`. Since `1 > -1`, the condition `h_K(-w) ≥ -1` is automatically satisfied.\nThus, the condition on `K` simplifies to `h_K(v) ≥ 1` for all `v ∈ S`.\n\n### Step 3: The Dual Problem and Polarity\n\nWe are looking for a convex set `K` that satisfies `h_K(p,q) ≥ 1` for all coprime integers `(p,q)` and has the minimum possible area. We can translate `K` so that the origin is in its interior without changing its area. Let `K^\\circ` be the polar body of `K`, defined as `K^\\circ = {y | x · y ≤ 1 for all x ∈ K}`.\n\nFor a convex set `K` containing the origin, its support function `h_K` is the gauge function `γ_{K^\\circ}` of its polar body. The gauge function is defined as `γ_C(v) = inf{λ > 0 | v ∈ λC}`.\n\nSo the condition on `K` becomes a condition on `K^\\circ`:\n`γ_{K^\\circ}(v) ≥ 1` for all `v ∈ S`.\n\nThe condition `γ_{K^\\circ}(v) ≥ 1` means that the point `v` cannot be in the interior of `K^\\circ`. Therefore, the problem is equivalent to finding a convex set `K` such that the interior of its polar body, `int(K^\\circ)`, contains no primitive integer lattice points.\n\n### Step 4: Maximizing the Area of the Polar Body\n\nOur goal is to minimize `Area(K)`. The Mahler conjecture (proven in 2D, also known as the Blaschke-Santaló inequality for the upper bound and Mahler's `Area(K)Area(K^\\circ) \\ge 8` for the lower bound for centrally symmetric `K`) relates the areas of `K` and `K^\\circ`. To minimize `Area(K)`, we should maximize `Area(K^\\circ)`.\n\nSo, the problem is transformed into: **Find the maximum area of a convex set `C` such that `int(C)` contains no primitive integer points.**\n\nA known result in the geometry of numbers (by Reich, 1982) states that any convex set in the plane with area greater than 4 must contain a primitive integer point in its interior. This bound is sharp.\nThe maximum area for such a primitive-point-free convex set is 4.\n\n### Step 5: Finding the Optimal Set and its Area\n\nThe maximum area of 4 is achieved by several sets, most notably the square `C_{max} = [-1, 1] × [-1, 1]`. The interior of this square is `(-1, 1) × (-1, 1)`, which contains no integer points at all, and thus no primitive integer points.\n\nWe choose this set to be our optimal polar body `K^\\circ`:\n`K^\\circ = C_{max} = [-1, 1] × [-1, 1]`.\n`Area(K^\\circ) = (1 - (-1)) × (1 - (-1)) = 2 × 2 = 4`.\n\nThe convex set `K` we are looking for is the polar of this square:\n`K = (K^\\circ)^\\circ = ([-1, 1] × [-1, 1])^\\circ`.\n\nThe polar of the square `|x| ≤ 1, |y| ≤ 1` can be calculated. By definition:\n`K = {(u, v) | xu + yv ≤ 1 for all (x, y) with |x|≤1, |y|≤1}`.\nThe expression `xu + yv` is maximized at the vertices of the square `(±1, ±1)`. So we need `max(u+v, u-v, -u+v, -u-v) ≤ 1`. This maximum is `|u| + |v|`.\nThus, the set `K` is defined by the inequality `|x| + |y| ≤ 1`.\n\nThis is a diamond shape (a square rotated by 45 degrees) with vertices at `(1, 0), (0, 1), (-1, 0), (0, -1)`.\n\nThe area of this diamond `K` is `(1/2) × (diagonal 1) × (diagonal 2) = (1/2) × 2 × 2 = 2`.\n\n### Step 6: Final Verification\n\nThe set `K = {(x, y) | |x| + |y| ≤ 1}` has area 2. We must verify that it satisfies the original condition.\nThe support function of this set is `h_K(p, q) = max(|p|, |q|)`.\nThe condition is `h_K(p, q) ≥ 1` for all coprime integers `p, q`.\nSo we need `max(|p|, |q|) ≥ 1`.\nSince `p` and `q` are coprime, they cannot both be zero. If one of them is non-zero, its absolute value is at least 1. Thus, `max(|p|, |q|) ≥ 1` is always true for coprime `p, q`. The condition holds.\n\nSince we found this area by maximizing the area of the polar body, this area is minimal."
