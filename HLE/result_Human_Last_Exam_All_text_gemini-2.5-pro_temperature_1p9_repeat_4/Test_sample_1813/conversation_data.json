    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the continued fraction associated with the generalized Markov number \\( m_{4/7} \\).\n\n### **Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n**1. Understand the problem and define the Generalized Markov Number \\(m_r\\)**\n\nThe question asks for the continued fraction associated with the generalized Markov number for the rational number \\(r = 4/7\\). The first step is to compute the value of \\(m_{4/7}\\). There are several definitions for generalized Markov numbers in the literature depending on the context (number theory, knot theory, etc.). The most relevant definition in the context of number theory, which generalizes the integer nature of classical Markov numbers, is given by a formula from Bombieri and Cohn.\n\nLet \\(r = p/q\\) be a rational number with its standard continued fraction expansion \\(r = [a_0; a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n]\\), where \\(a_n > 1\\) for uniqueness if \\(n>0\\). The generalized Markov number \\(m_{p/q}\\) is defined as:\n\\(m_{p/q} = q_{n-1} + p'_{n}\\)\nwhere:\n*   \\(q_{n-1}\\) is the denominator of the \\((n-1)\\)-th convergent of the continued fraction of \\(r\\).\n*   \\(p'_{n}\\) is the numerator of the \\(n\\)-th convergent of the reversed continued fraction \\(r_{rev} = [a_n; a_{n-1}, \\dots, a_0]\\).\n\n**2. Compute the Continued Fraction of \\(r = 4/7\\)**\n\nWe use the Euclidean Algorithm to find the continued fraction expansion of \\(4/7\\):\n\\(7 = 1 \\cdot 4 + 3\\)\n\\(4 = 1 \\cdot 3 + 1\\)\n\\(3 = 3 \\cdot 1 + 0\\)\nFrom this, we can write the continued fraction:\n\\( \\frac{4}{7} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{7}{4}} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{3}{4}} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{1}{\\frac{4}{3}}} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{1}{3}}} \\)\nSo, the continued fraction for \\(4/7\\) is \\([0; 1, 1, 3]\\).\nThe coefficients are \\(a_0 = 0, a_1 = 1, a_2 = 1, a_3 = 3\\). The index of the last term is \\(n=3\\). This is the standard form since \\(a_3=3 > 1\\).\n\n**3. Calculate \\(q_{n-1}\\)**\n\nWe need to find \\(q_{n-1} = q_2\\), the denominator of the second convergent of \\([0; 1, 1, 3]\\). We compute the convergents' denominators using the recurrence relation \\(q_k = a_k q_{k-1} + q_{k-2}\\) with initial values \\(q_{-1} = 0\\) and \\(q_0 = 1\\).\n*   \\(q_0 = 1\\)\n*   \\(q_1 = a_1 q_0 + q_{-1} = 1 \\cdot 1 + 0 = 1\\)\n*   \\(q_2 = a_2 q_1 + q_0 = 1 \\cdot 1 + 1 = 2\\)\nThus, \\(q_{n-1} = q_2 = 2\\).\n\n**4. Calculate \\(p'_{n}\\)**\n\nWe need to find \\(p'_{n} = p'_3\\), which is the numerator of the 3rd convergent of the reversed continued fraction.\nThe reversed sequence of coefficients is \\([a_3, a_2, a_1, a_0] = [3, 1, 1, 0]\\). Let's call these coefficients \\(b_k\\): \\(b_0=3, b_1=1, b_2=1, b_3=0\\).\nWe compute the numerators of the convergents, \\(p'_k\\), using the recurrence \\(p'_k = b_k p'_{k-1} + p'_{k-2}\\) with initial values \\(p'_{-1} = 1\\) and \\(p'_0 = b_0\\).\n*   \\(p'_0 = b_0 = 3\\)\n*   \\(p'_1 = b_1 p'_0 + p'_{-1} = 1 \\cdot 3 + 1 = 4\\)\n*   \\(p'_2 = b_2 p'_1 + p'_0 = 1 \\cdot 4 + 3 = 7\\)\n*   \\(p'_3 = b_3 p'_2 + p'_1 = 0 \\cdot 7 + 4 = 4\\)\nThus, \\(p'_{n} = p'_3 = 4\\).\n\n**5. Compute the Generalized Markov Number \\(m_{4/7}\\)**\n\nNow we can substitute the values of \\(q_{n-1}\\) and \\(p'_{n}\\) into the formula for \\(m_{4/7}\\):\n\\(m_{4/7} = q_{n-1} + p'_{n} = 2 + 4 = 6\\)\nSo, the generalized Markov number associated with \\(4/7\\) is 6.\n\n**6. Compute the Continued Fraction of \\(m_{4/7}\\)**\n\nThe final step is to find the continued fraction associated with the number we just computed. The number is 6.\nThe continued fraction of an integer \\(N\\) is simply \\([N]\\).\nTherefore, the continued fraction of 6 is \\([6]\\).\n\n### **Final Answer**\nThe continued fraction associated with the generalized Markov number \\( m_{4/7} \\) is computed as follows:\n1.  The continued fraction of \\(r = 4/7\\) is \\([0; 1, 1, 3]\\). Here \\(a_0=0, a_1=1, a_2=1, a_3=3\\), so \\(n=3\\).\n2.  The denominator of the penultimate convergent \\(q_{n-1} = q_2\\) is 2.\n3.  The reversed continued fraction is formed with coefficients \\([a_3, a_2, a_1, a_0] = [3, 1, 1, 0]\\). The numerator of its \\(n\\)-th (\\(3^{rd}\\)) convergent, \\(p'_3\\), is 4.\n4.  The generalized Markov number is \\(m_{4/7} = q_2 + p'_3 = 2 + 4 = 6\\).\n5.  The continued fraction of the integer 6 is \\([6]\\).\n\n<<<[6]>>>"
