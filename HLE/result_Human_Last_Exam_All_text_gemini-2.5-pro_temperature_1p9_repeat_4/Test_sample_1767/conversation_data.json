    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Components:**\n    *   We start with two separate systems.\n    *   System 1: A Chern insulator. Its topological property is characterized by a Chern number, $C_1 = 1$.\n    *   System 2: Another Chern insulator, identical to the first. Its Chern number is $C_2 = 1$.\n\n2.  **Understand the \"Junction\":**\n    *   The two Chern insulators are brought together to \"connect laterally\".\n    *   Crucially, the \"tunneling barrier is negligible\". This means the electrons can move freely between the two materials at the interface.\n    *   Functionally, this creates a single, larger system, rather than two distinct systems interacting across a barrier. The question is asking for the Chern number of this new, composite system.\n\n3.  **Recall the Properties of the Chern Number:**\n    *   The Chern number is a topological invariant of the bulk electronic band structure. It is robust against small perturbations as long as the bulk energy gap does not close.\n    *   A fundamental property of topological invariants like the Chern number is their **additivity**. When two topological systems are combined (or \"stacked\") to form a larger system without closing the bulk gap, the Chern number of the composite system is the sum of the Chern numbers of its constituents.\n    *   The Hamiltonian of the combined system can be thought of as a block matrix constructed from the Hamiltonians of the individual systems, $H_{total} \\approx \\begin{pmatrix} H_1 & V \\\\ V^\\dagger & H_2 \\end{pmatrix}$. With negligible tunneling, the coupling V at the interface smoothly connects the two, but the bulk topology of the overall system is determined by the sum of the individual bulk topologies.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Total Chern Number:**\n    *   Let $C_{total}$ be the Chern number of the combined junction.\n    *   According to the principle of additivity, $C_{total} = C_1 + C_2$.\n    *   Substituting the given values: $C_{total} = 1 + 1 = 2$.\n\n### List of Careful Points\n\n1.  **Nature of the Junction:** The term \"negligible tunneling barrier\" is key. It implies that we are not just looking at an interface phenomenon but are evaluating the bulk topological property of the entire combined material.\n2.  **Additivity Principle:** The core concept is that the Chern number is additive for composite systems. This is a general feature of topological charges. If one of the insulators had a Chern number of -1, the total would be $1 + (-1) = 0$, resulting in a topologically trivial system.\n3.  **Bulk vs. Edge:** The Chern number is a *bulk* property. While it has consequences at the edges (the bulk-boundary correspondence), the calculation itself relies on the properties of the bulk. For this problem, considering the additivity of the bulk invariant is the most direct approach.\n4.  **Physical Interpretation (Bulk-Boundary Correspondence):** A Chern insulator with Chern number $C$ hosts $|C|$ chiral edge states.\n    *   Each individual insulator ($C=1$) has one chiral edge state on its boundary.\n    *   When joined, the edge states at the internal interface between the two materials are counter-propagating and will typically gap each other out (annihilate).\n    *   The edge states on the outer boundary of the composite system will remain. Since both original systems contribute an edge state moving in the same chiral direction, the new, larger system will have two co-propagating chiral edge states on its outer boundary.\n    *   A system with two chiral edge states corresponds to a bulk Chern number of $C=2$. This physical picture confirms the result obtained from the additivity principle.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe Chern number of the junction is the sum of the Chern numbers of the individual insulators.\n\n$C_{total} = C_1 + C_2 = 1 + 1 = 2$.\n\nThe resulting system is a Chern insulator with a Chern number of 2.\n\n<<<2>>>"
