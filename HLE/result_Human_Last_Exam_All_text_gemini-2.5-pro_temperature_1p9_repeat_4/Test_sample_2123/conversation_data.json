    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstructing the Question:** The core components are:\n    *   **A location:** The wide boulevards of Vienna.\n    *   **A source text:** A Russian translation of an essay (or, more accurately, an essay written in Russian).\n    *   **A specific detail:** The mention of an English poet's surname.\n    *   **The task:** To identify this surname in English.\n\n2.  **Identifying the \"Trick\" or Key Clue:** The question is a well-known literary puzzle. Its solution hinges not on a direct statement but on a metaphorical association made by the essay's author. The mention of \"Russian translation\" is crucial as it points to a linguistic and cultural context rooted in the Russian language.\n\n3.  **Pinpointing the Source:** The essay in question is not a translation, but a work by the prominent Soviet writer Yuri Olesha (Юрий Олеша). In one of his travel essays, he describes his impressions of Vienna.\n\n4.  **Analyzing the Author's Description:** When describing the Viennese boulevards, Olesha is particularly captivated by the brilliant, vibrant green of the lawns. He seeks a powerful image to convey their intensity.\n\n5.  **Uncovering the Metaphor:** Olesha uses a specific metaphor. He describes the impossibly green lawns as \"green fires\" (in Russian: `зелёные огни`, `zelyonyye ogni`). He writes that looking at these \"green fires\" burning under the trees reminded him of an English poet's surname.\n\n6.  **Making the Linguistic Connection:** The key word in the metaphor is \"fires.\" The idea of something burning evokes the English verb \"to burn.\" This verb is phonetically identical to the surname of the famous Scottish poet, Robert Burns.\n\n7.  **Identifying the Poet:** The surname suggested by the word \"burn\" is **Burns**. While Robert Burns was Scottish, in the context of such general literary questions, he is often categorized broadly under \"English\" literature or as an \"English poet\" by non-native speakers.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n*   **The \"Translation\" Distractor:** The question states \"Russian translation of a certain essay.\" This is slightly misleading. The essay was written in Russian by Yuri Olesha. The phrase likely intends to emphasize that the wordplay works through the author's Russian-language description of a foreign place.\n*   **The \"English Poet\" Generality:** Robert Burns was Scottish, not English. However, in the context of Russian literary knowledge and general parlance, \"English poet\" is often used as a broader term for major poets from the British Isles. This slight inaccuracy in the question does not change the answer.\n*   **The Metaphor is Key:** The answer cannot be found by simply searching for mentions of poets in travel guides to Vienna. The solution is entirely dependent on knowing or deducing Yuri Olesha's specific metaphorical description of the lawns as \"green fires.\"\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBy seeing the Viennese lawns as \"green fires,\" Yuri Olesha makes a creative leap. The concept of \"burning\" triggers the association with the surname of the poet Robert Burns.\n\n<<<Burns>>>"
