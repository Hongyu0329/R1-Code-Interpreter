    "This problem requires calculating the rule activation level for a fuzzy logic rule. Let's break down the process.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Concept of \"Rule Activation Level\"**\n    In a fuzzy inference system, a rule has an antecedent (the \"IF\" part) and a consequent (the \"THEN\" part). The \"rule activation level,\" also known as the firing strength, represents the degree to which the antecedent is satisfied by the current inputs. This value is then used to determine the output of that specific rule.\n\n2.  **Understand the Role of a \"T-norm\"**\n    The antecedent of a rule can consist of multiple conditions joined by logical operators like \"AND\". A t-norm (triangular norm) is a mathematical function that models the fuzzy \"AND\" operator. It combines the membership values (degrees of truth) of all conditions in the antecedent to compute the single overall activation level for the rule.\n\n3.  **Interpret the Provided Information**\n    *   We are given two values: `Phi_k(x′) = 0.7` and `μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9`.\n    *   The rule activation level is determined solely by the antecedent (\"IF\" part). The value `μG_k_j(y_j)` refers to a membership grade in the consequent set `G`, which is part of the \"THEN\" part. A consequent value is not used to calculate the activation level of the antecedent that precedes it.\n    *   Therefore, the most logical interpretation is that the question presents the membership values for two different conditions within the *same antecedent*, connected by an \"AND\" operator. For example, a rule like: `IF condition_1 (is true to 0.7) AND condition_2 (is true to 0.9) THEN ...`\n    *   **Value 1**: `0.7` (degree of truth for the first condition).\n    *   **Value 2**: `0.9` (degree of truth for the second condition).\n    *   **Note on Interval Type-3:** Although the question mentions Interval Type-3 (IT3) fuzzy sets, it provides crisp numbers (0.7, 0.9). In a full IT3 context, these would be complex Type-2 fuzzy sets. The use of simple numbers indicates that the problem is simplified, likely focusing on the core t-norm operation using the upper bounds of these sets, which mathematically mirrors a Type-1 fuzzy calculation.\n\n4.  **Select and Apply the T-norm**\n    The question specifies using \"a t-norm operation\" but does not name a specific one. The most common and standard t-norm used in fuzzy logic is the **minimum operator (`min`)**. We will proceed with this standard choice.\n    *   Rule Activation Level = `t-norm(value_1, value_2)`\n    *   Rule Activation Level = `min(0.7, 0.9)`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Answer**\n    *   Comparing the two values, 0.7 is the minimum.\n    *   `min(0.7, 0.9) = 0.7`\n    *   The rule is only as strong as its weakest condition when using the AND operator.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe rule activation level is **0.7**.\n\n<<<0.7>>>"
