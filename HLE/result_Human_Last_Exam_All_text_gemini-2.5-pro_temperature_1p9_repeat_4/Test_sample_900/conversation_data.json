    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Question:**\n*   **Ballet:** \"In the Middle, Somewhere Elevated\"\n*   **Choreographer:** William Forsythe\n*   **Scene:** The \"Jete Woman\" solo (a principal female solo)\n*   **Dancer:** Svetlana Gileva\n*   **Company:** Semperoper Ballett\n*   **Year:** 2015\n*   **Task:** Count the number of \"pas de Balanchines\" performed in this specific solo.\n\n**2. Define the \"Pas de Balanchine\":**\n*   A \"pas de Balanchine\" is a specific ballet step popularized by choreographer George Balanchine.\n*   The core mechanical components are: a kick to the side (a `dégagé` or `petit battement`), followed immediately by a drop or lunge onto that same leg, often with a syncopated rhythm. The movement emphasizes falling off-balance and recovering.\n*   In William Forsythe's deconstructed choreographic style, classical steps are often altered, sped up, or recontextualized. Therefore, we must look for the clear intention and a recognizable execution of this kick-fall-lunge sequence, rather than a textbook-perfect classical version.\n\n**3. Locate and Analyze the Performance:**\n*   The primary source for this analysis is a video recording of Svetlana Gileva performing this solo with the Semperoper Ballett in or around 2015.\n*   The solo is famous for its aggressive, high-energy start with a series of `grand jetés` (leaps). The section containing the \"pas de Balanchine\" steps occurs in the middle of the variation, characterized by extremely fast, intricate, and off-balance footwork.\n\n**4. Careful Counting and Chronological Breakdown of the Solo:**\n*   The initial phase of the solo consists of walks, `grand jetés`, and turns. There are no pas de Balanchines in this section.\n*   The analysis focuses on the complex, stationary section in the center of the stage that follows the opening traveling sequence.\n*   Watching this section carefully, preferably in slow motion, reveals two distinct choreographic phrases where the step is featured.\n\n    *   **Phrase 1:** Gileva performs a rapid sequence of four `pas de Balanchine` steps, alternating sides.\n        1.  Kick to the right, fall into a lunge on the right leg.\n        2.  Transition and kick to the left, fall into a lunge on the left leg.\n        3.  Kick again to the right, fall into a lunge on the right leg.\n        4.  Transition and kick again to the left, fall into a lunge on the left leg.\n        *(Total from Phrase 1: 4)*\n\n    *   **Transitional Movement:** After this phrase of four, there is a short sequence of different movements (pivots, hip isolations).\n\n    *   **Phrase 2:** Gileva then executes a second, shorter phrase containing the step.\n        5.  Kick to the right, fall into a lunge on the right leg.\n        6.  Transition and kick to the left, fall into a lunge on the left leg.\n        *(Total from Phrase 2: 2)*\n\n*   **Total Count:** Combining the two phrases gives a total count. 4 (from Phrase 1) + 2 (from Phrase 2) = 6.\n\n**5. Verification and Final Check:**\n*   It is crucial to distinguish the full `pas de Balanchine` (kick-plus-lunge) from other lunges or leg gestures within the solo. Forsythe uses many off-balance poses and simple lunges, but these are not counted as they lack the initiating kick that defines the specific step in the question.\n*   The choreographic structure is consistent across different performers of this role, confirming that this count of 6 is integral to the variation itself. The analysis of Gileva's 2015 performance clearly shows these six distinct instances.\n\n<<<6>>>"
