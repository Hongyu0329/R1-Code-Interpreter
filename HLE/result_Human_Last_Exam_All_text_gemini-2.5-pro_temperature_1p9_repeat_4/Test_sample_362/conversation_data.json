    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction to determine the final product.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Reactants and Reaction Type\nThe problem describes a **Wittig reaction**. This reaction involves the formation of an alkene from a carbonyl compound (an aldehyde or ketone) and a phosphonium ylide (also known as a Wittig reagent).\n\n*   **Carbonyl Compound:** The first reactant is **pivalaldehyde**.\n    *   The \"pivaloyl\" group is a tert-butyl group attached to a carbonyl carbon.\n    *   Pivalaldehyde is the common name for 2,2-dimethylpropanal.\n    *   Its chemical structure is:\n         \n        (CH₃)₃C-CHO\n\n*   **Wittig Reagent (Ylide):** The second reactant is **(2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-$\\lambda^5$-phosphane**.\n    *   \"triphenyl-$\\lambda^5$-phosphane\" indicates a phosphorus atom with three phenyl (Ph) groups, forming an ylide (Ph₃P=C).\n    *   \"(...ethylidene)\" indicates a two-carbon fragment attached to the phosphorus via a double bond. The stem \"ethylidene\" refers to a `C¹H-C²H₃` group.\n    *   \"2-(2-chlorophenyl)\" is a substituent on the second carbon (C²) of the ethylidene group. The term \"2-chlorophenyl\" means a phenyl ring with a chlorine atom at the ortho position.\n    *   Combining these parts, the structure of the ylide is:\n         \n        Ph₃P=CH-CH₂-(C₆H₄Cl)\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Connectivity of the Product\nThe core of the Wittig reaction is the coupling of the carbon from the carbonyl group with the ylidic carbon (the carbon double-bonded to phosphorus) to form a new C=C double bond. The oxygen atom from the aldehyde and the triphenylphosphine group from the ylide are eliminated, forming triphenylphosphine oxide (Ph₃PO) as a byproduct.\n\n*   Fragment from pivalaldehyde: (CH₃)₃C-CH=\n*   Fragment from the ylide: =CH-CH₂-(C₆H₄Cl)\n*   Combining these two fragments at the double bond gives the product's backbone structure:\n    (CH₃)₃C-CH=CH-CH₂-(C₆H₄Cl)\n\n### Step 3: Name the Product\nWe will use IUPAC nomenclature to name the alkene product.\n\n1.  **Find the longest carbon chain containing the C=C double bond.**\n    The chain is `(C₅H₃)-C₄(CH₃)₂-C₃H=C₂H-C₁H₂-(2-chlorophenyl)`. This is a 5-carbon chain. Therefore, the parent name is **pentene**.\n2.  **Number the chain to give the double bond the lowest possible locant.**\n    Numbering from the end closer to the double bond (the phenyl side) gives the double bond starting at C-2.\n    `1-(2-chlorophenyl)-...-pent-2-ene`\n3.  **Identify and locate the substituents.**\n    *   At position 1: A `2-chlorophenyl` group.\n    *   At position 4: Two `methyl` groups.\n4.  **Assemble the full name.**\n    The name is **1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene**.\n\n### Step 4: Determine the Stereochemistry (E/Z Isomerism)\nThe Wittig reaction's stereoselectivity depends on the nature of the ylide.\n\n*   **Ylide type:** The group attached to the ylidic carbon (`-CH-`) is `-CH₂-(C₆H₄Cl)`. This is a primary alkyl group. Ylides with alkyl or hydrogen substituents are considered **unstabilized ylides** because there are no electron-withdrawing groups to stabilize the negative charge in the zwitterionic resonance form (`Ph₃P⁺-C⁻-`).\n*   **Selectivity Rule:** Wittig reactions with unstabilized ylides typically proceed under kinetic control and favor the formation of the **Z-alkene** (cis-isomer).\n*   **Assigning E/Z Configuration:** We use the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules for the groups on the two carbons of the double bond (C2 and C3).\n    *   **On C2:** The substituents are `-CH₂-(C₆H₄Cl)` and `-H`. The `-CH₂-(C₆H₄Cl)` group has higher priority.\n    *   **On C3:** The substituents are `-C(CH₃)₃` (tert-butyl) and `-H`. The `-C(CH₃)₃` group has higher priority.\n*   For the **Z-isomer** (from German *zusammen*, meaning \"together\"), the two high-priority groups are on the same side of the double bond. The reaction will preferentially form this isomer.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe product of the Wittig reaction is the alkene formed by coupling the two reactants, with a Z-configuration at the newly formed double bond.\n\n**Product:** (Z)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene\n\nThe structure is:\n \n\n<<< (Z)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene >>>"
