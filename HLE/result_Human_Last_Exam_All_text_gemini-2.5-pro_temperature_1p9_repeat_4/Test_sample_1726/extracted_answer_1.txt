6. $L = L_0 \sqrt{1+v^2}$ (where L is the observed length and $L_0$ is the proper length)
7. $\Delta t = \frac{\Delta t_0}{\sqrt{1+v^2}}$ (where $\Delta t$ is the observed time interval and $\Delta t_0$ is the proper time interval)
8. $u = \frac{u_1 + u_2}{1 - u_1 u_2}$ (where $u_1$ and $u_2$ are collinear velocities and $u$ is their resultant velocity)
