    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the letter formed by the two high school buildings.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Task:** The goal is to determine the shape, specifically a letter of the alphabet, formed by the buildings of two high schools in Pisa, Italy, when viewed from above.\n2.  **Identify the Subjects:** The two schools are the Istituto Galilei-Pacinotti and the Istituto Ulisse Dini.\n3.  **Locate the Schools:** To see the buildings from above, we need to use a mapping service with satellite imagery (like Google Maps or similar). A search for \"Istituto Galilei-Pacinotti, Pisa\" and \"Istituto Ulisse Dini, Pisa\" will show that they are located right next to each other.\n4.  **Analyze the Building Shapes from Satellite View:**\n    *   The main building complex of the **Istituto Galilei-Pacinotti** (specifically the Liceo Scientifico \"G. Galilei\" part) is a long, straight structure running roughly north-to-south along the street Via Benedetto Croce. This forms a clear vertical line.\n    *   The main building complex of the **Istituto Ulisse Dini** is positioned at the southern end of the Galilei-Pacinotti building. It extends horizontally (east-to-west) from the base of the other building. This forms a clear horizontal line.\n5.  **Combine the Shapes:** When you view the two buildings as a single entity, the long vertical structure of Galilei-Pacinotti combined with the horizontal structure of Ulisse Dini at its base forms a distinct right angle.\n6.  **Identify the Letter:** This shape, a vertical line connected to a horizontal line at its base, clearly forms the capital letter **L**.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Precise Location:** It's crucial to find the correct buildings on a map. The schools are large complexes, but their main, conjoined wings are what create the distinct shape.\n*   **Perspective:** The question specifies \"seen from above,\" which makes satellite imagery essential. A street-level view would not reveal the shape.\n*   **Combined View:** The letter is formed by the two buildings *together*, not by either one in isolation.\n*   **Orientation:** While map orientation might change, the 90-degree angle between the buildings remains constant, preserving the \"L\" shape regardless of rotation.\n\nBased on the analysis of satellite images, the combined layout of the two school buildings forms the letter L.\n\n<<<L>>>"
