    "Answering this question requires several steps in low-dimensional topology.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the relevant manifolds:**\n    The question asks for elements of the homology cobordism group, $\\Theta_{\\mathbb{Z}}^3$. These elements are equivalence classes of oriented integral homology 3-spheres. We need to find which ones can be constructed by \"integral surgery on a knot with at most four crossings\".\n    *   **Integral Surgery and Homology Spheres:** A surgery on a knot $K \\subset S^3$ with coefficient $p/q$ produces a 3-manifold $S_{p/q}^3(K)$. The first homology group of this manifold is $H_1(S_{p/q}^3(K); \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}/p\\mathbb{Z}$. For this to be an integral homology sphere, we need $H_1=0$, which implies $p = \\pm 1$. An \"integral surgery\" usually refers to a surgery with an integer coefficient, say $n$, which corresponds to a fraction $n/1$. So for integral surgery, we need $n = \\pm 1$.\n    *   **Knots with at most four crossings:** We need to list all prime knots up to crossing number 4, keeping chirality in mind as it can lead to distinct knots.\n        *   0 crossings: The unknot, $0_1$. This knot is achiral (equivalent to its mirror image).\n        *   1, 2 crossings: No knots.\n        *   3 crossings: The trefoil knot, $3_1$. This knot is chiral. So we have the right-handed trefoil ($3_1$) and the left-handed trefoil ($m(3_1)$).\n        *   4 crossings: The figure-eight knot, $4_1$. This knot is amphichiral (achiral).\n    So, the list of distinct knots to consider is: $0_1$, $3_1$, $m(3_1)$, and $4_1$.\n\n2.  **Generate the Candidate Homology Spheres:**\n    For each of the 4 knots, we can perform a $+1$ surgery and a $-1$ surgery. This gives a total of $4 \\times 2 = 8$ candidate manifolds.\n    *   From the unknot ($0_1$): $S_{+1}^3(0_1)$ and $S_{-1}^3(0_1)$. Both of these surgeries on the unknot result in the standard 3-sphere, $S^3$. This represents the identity element in the homology cobordism group $\\Theta_{\\mathbb{Z}}^3$.\n    *   From the right-handed trefoil ($3_1$): $S_{+1}^3(3_1)$ and $S_{-1}^3(3_1)$.\n    *   From the left-handed trefoil ($m(3_1)$): $S_{+1}^3(m(3_1))$ and $S_{-1}^3(m(3_1))$.\n    *   From the figure-eight knot ($4_1$): $S_{+1}^3(4_1)$ and $S_{-1}^3(4_1)$.\n\n3.  **Identify Distinct Homology Cobordism Classes:**\n    We need to determine how many distinct homology cobordism classes are represented by these 8 manifolds. We use homology cobordism invariants to distinguish them. The primary invariants are the Casson invariant $\\lambda(Y)$ and the Heegaard Floer correction term $d(Y)$. If two manifolds have different $(\\lambda, d)$ pairs, they belong to different classes.\n\n    Let's analyze the 6 non-trivial manifolds. We use the following important identities relating surgery on a knot and its mirror image:\n    *   $S_{\\epsilon}^3(m(K)) \\cong -S_{-\\epsilon}^3(K)$, where $\\epsilon = \\pm 1$ and $-Y$ denotes the manifold $Y$ with the opposite orientation.\n    *   For an amphichiral knot like $4_1$, $K \\cong m(K)$, so $S_{\\epsilon}^3(4_1) \\cong -S_{-\\epsilon}^3(4_1)$.\n\n    Let's calculate the $(\\lambda,d)$ invariants for one surgery on each knot type and derive the others.\n    *   **$Y_1 = S_{+1}^3(3_1)$:** This is the Poincaré homology sphere $\\Sigma(2,3,7)$. It's known that $\\lambda(Y_1) = -1$ and $d(Y_1) = -2$. This gives class **C1**.\n    *   **$Y_2 = S_{-1}^3(3_1)$:** This is the Brieskorn sphere $\\Sigma(2,3,5)$. It's known that $\\lambda(Y_2) = +1$ and $d(Y_2) = 0$. This gives class **C2**.\n    *   **$Y_3 = S_{+1}^3(4_1)$:** It's known that $\\lambda(Y_3) = -1$ and (since $4_1$ is an alternating knot) $d(Y_3)=0$. This gives class **C3**.\n\n    Now we can determine the classes of the remaining three manifolds:\n    *   **$S_{-1}^3(m(3_1))$**: Using the identity, this is $\\cong -S_{+1}^3(3_1) = -Y_1$. Its class is the inverse of C1, with invariants $(\\lambda,d) = (1, 2)$. This is class **-C1**.\n    *   **$S_{+1}^3(m(3_1))$**: Using the identity, this is $\\cong -S_{-1}^3(3_1) = -Y_2$. Its class is the inverse of C2, with invariants $(\\lambda,d) = (-1, 0)$. This is class **-C2**.\n    *   **$S_{-1}^3(4_1)$**: Since $4_1$ is amphichiral, this is $\\cong -S_{+1}^3(4_1) = -Y_3$. Its class is the inverse of C3, with invariants $(\\lambda,d) = (1, 0)$. This is class **-C3**.\n\n4.  **Count the Final Number of Classes:**\n    The generated homology spheres represent the following classes:\n    1.  The trivial class $[S^3]$ (from the unknot). Let's call it **C0**.\n    2.  Class C1: $(\\lambda, d) = (-1, -2)$.\n    3.  Class C2: $(\\lambda, d) = (1, 0)$.\n    4.  Class C3: $(\\lambda, d) = (-1, 0)$.\n    5.  Class -C1: $(\\lambda, d) = (1, 2)$.\n    6.  Class -C2: $(\\lambda, d) = (-1, 0)$.\n    7.  Class -C3: $(\\lambda, d) = (1, 0)$.\n\n    Now, we check for overlaps. Classes with different $(\\lambda, d)$ pairs are distinct.\n    *   C0, C1, and -C1 have unique $(\\lambda, d)$ pairs, so they are distinct from all others. This gives 3 classes so far: [S³], C1, -C1.\n    *   We have two classes with $(\\lambda, d) = (1, 0)$: C2 and -C3.\n    *   We have two classes with $(\\lambda, d) = (-1, 0)$: C3 and -C2.\n\n    **Are C2 and -C3 the same?** C2 is $[S_{-1}^3(3_1)]$ and -C3 is $[S_{-1}^3(4_1)]$. More advanced invariants from Heegaard Floer theory and Seiberg-Witten theory, which are sensitive to the knot type (specifically, the knot's Alexander polynomial, which is different for $3_1$ and $4_1$), can distinguish these homology spheres. They are known to be distinct homology cobordism classes. So C2 $\\neq$ -C3.\n\n    **Are C3 and -C2 the same?** C3 is $[S_{+1}^3(4_1)]$ and -C2 is $[S_{+1}^3(m(3_1))]$. Since C2 and -C3 are distinct, their inverses, -C2 and C3, must also be distinct.\n\n    Therefore, all the listed classes are distinct. Let's count them:\n    1.  $[S^3]$ (the identity element C0)\n    2.  C1 = $[S_{+1}^3(3_1)]$\n    3.  -C1 = $[S_{-1}^3(m(3_1))]$\n    4.  C2 = $[S_{-1}^3(3_1)]$\n    5.  -C2 = $[S_{+1}^3(m(3_1))]$\n    6.  C3 = $[S_{+1}^3(4_1)]$\n    7.  -C3 = $[S_{-1}^3(4_1)]$\n\n    This gives a total of $1+2+2+2 = 7$ distinct elements."
