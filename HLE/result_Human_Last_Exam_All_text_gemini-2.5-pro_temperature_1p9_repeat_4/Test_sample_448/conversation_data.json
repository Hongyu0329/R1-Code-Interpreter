    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Subject:** The question is about the \"rarest noble gas\". The noble gases are a group of chemical elements in Group 18 of the periodic table. For Earth's natural composition, these are: Helium (He), Neon (Ne), Argon (Ar), Krypton (Kr), Xenon (Xe), and Radon (Rn).\n\n2.  **Define the Scope:** The question specifies \"on Earth as a percentage of all terrestrial matter\". This means we must consider the total amount of each noble gas in the entire Earth system (atmosphere, crust, oceans, etc.), not just its concentration in the air.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Time Frame:** The question mentions the year \"2002\". For the abundance of stable elements on a planetary scale, this specific year is not significant. The geological and atmospheric composition of these gases has not changed meaningfully in human history. The fundamental properties determining their abundance are constant. This detail is likely a distractor.\n\n4.  **Evaluate Each Noble Gas Candidate:**\n    *   **Argon (Ar):** This is by far the most abundant noble gas in the Earth's atmosphere, at about 0.93%. This high abundance is due to the radioactive decay of Potassium-40 in the Earth's crust over geological time. It is definitely not the rarest.\n    *   **Neon (Ne):** Its concentration in the atmosphere is about 18 parts per million (ppm). It is the second most abundant noble gas.\n    *   **Helium (He):** Its atmospheric concentration is about 5.2 ppm. Significant amounts are also trapped in the Earth's crust, as it is a product of the radioactive decay of uranium and thorium. While light enough to escape to space, its continuous production keeps it more abundant than the heavier noble gases (except Argon).\n    *   **Krypton (Kr):** Its atmospheric concentration is about 1.1 ppm. It is rarer than He, Ne, and Ar.\n    *   **Xenon (Xe):** This is a very rare stable noble gas. Its atmospheric concentration is only about 0.09 ppm (or 90 parts per billion). It is a strong candidate for being the rarest.\n    *   **Radon (Rn):** This is the crucial candidate to analyze carefully. Unlike the other noble gases, Radon is radioactive. Its most stable isotope, Radon-222, has a very short half-life of only 3.8 days. It is not a primordial element from the Earth's formation but is instead continuously produced from the radioactive decay of radium (which is part of the decay chain of uranium).\n\n5.  **Compare the Rarest Candidates (Xenon vs. Radon):**\n    *   **Xenon (Xe)** is stable. Its quantity on Earth is a fixed, albeit very small, amount. The total mass of Xenon in the atmosphere alone is estimated to be in the trillions of kilograms.\n    *   **Radon (Rn)** is unstable and decays rapidly. This means it never gets a chance to accumulate. Its abundance is a \"steady-state\" concentration, where the rate of its creation from radium decay is balanced by its rate of decay. The total amount of Radon present on the entire planet at any single moment is incredibly small. Scientific estimates place the total mass of Radon in the entire atmosphere at less than 1 kilogram.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** Because Radon decays so quickly, its total instantaneous mass is many orders of magnitude smaller than the total mass of Xenon. Therefore, measured as a percentage of all terrestrial matter at any given time, Radon is the rarest noble gas.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Radioactivity is Key:** The critical factor that makes Radon the rarest is its radioactivity and short half-life, which prevents it from accumulating.\n*   **Total vs. Atmospheric Abundance:** While atmospheric concentration is a good starting point for comparison, the final answer rests on the total amount in the entire Earth system. For Radon, its fleeting existence everywhere makes its total mass minuscule.\n*   **The Year is a Distractor:** The fundamental physics and geology that govern these abundances were the same in 2002 as they are today.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the analysis, Radon's extremely short half-life and continuous decay mean that its total instantaneous mass on Earth is vastly smaller than that of any other noble gas, including Xenon.\n\n<<<Radon>>>"
