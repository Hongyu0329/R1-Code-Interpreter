    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nThe user wants to find the computational time complexity of the provided algorithm `IMAG(n, c)`. The complexity is generally measured as a function of the size of the input, which in this case is the integer `n`.\n\n**1. Understand the Algorithm's Purpose**\nThe algorithm `IMAG(n, c)` converts a non-negative integer `n` into its representation in base `c`. It does this by repeatedly dividing the number by the base `c` and recording the remainders. The remainders, in reverse order of calculation, form the digits of the number in the new base.\n\n**2. Identify the Main Computational Part**\nThe algorithm consists of three main parts:\n*   **Step 1 (Initialization):** A set of initial calculations performed once before the loop.\n*   **Step 2 (The `while` loop):** A loop that runs as long as the quotient `q` is greater than 0. This is where the bulk of the computation occurs.\n*   **Step 3 (Return):** Returning the final result.\n\nThe overall time complexity will be dominated by the `while` loop, as the other steps are executed only once.\n\n**3. Analyze the `while` Loop**\n\nTo analyze the loop, we need to determine:\na. How many times the loop iterates.\nb. The amount of work done in each iteration.\n\n**3a. Number of Iterations**\n*   The loop continues as long as `q > 0`.\n*   Let's trace the value that determines `q`. In each iteration, `x` is set to the previous `q`, and then `q` is set to `⌊x/c⌋`. This means that the variable `x` (which drives the process) is effectively divided by `c` in each iteration.\n*   The process starts with `x = n`. After the first calculation (before the loop), the quotient is `q ≈ n/c`. Inside the first loop iteration, `x` becomes `≈ n/c`, and the new quotient `q` becomes `≈ (n/c)/c = n/c²`.\n*   The sequence of the values of `x` inside the loop will be approximately `n/c, n/c², n/c³,...`.\n*   The loop terminates when the quotient `q` becomes 0. This happens when `x` becomes less than `c` (so that `⌊x/c⌋ = 0`).\n*   Let `k` be the number of iterations of the `while` loop. After `k` iterations, the value of `x` will be roughly `n/c^k`. The loop will terminate when this value becomes 0. This occurs when `n/c^(k+1) < 1`, or `n < c^(k+1)`.\n*   Taking the logarithm to the base `c` on both sides gives: `log_c(n) < k + 1`.\n*   This implies that the number of iterations `k` is on the order of `log_c(n)`. More precisely, the number of iterations is `⌊log_c(n)⌋`.\n*   Therefore, the number of times the loop runs is `O(log_c(n))`.\n\n**3b. Work per Iteration**\n*   Inside the loop (step 2.1), the following operations are performed:\n    *   `i := i + 1`: one increment (addition).\n    *   `x := q`: one assignment.\n    *   `q := ⌊x/c⌋`: one integer division.\n    *   `a_i := x — qc`: one multiplication and one subtraction.\n*   Assuming that `n` fits within a standard computer word size, these basic arithmetic operations (addition, assignment, division, multiplication, subtraction) can be considered to take constant time, `O(1)`.\n*   Therefore, the work done inside each iteration is constant.\n\n**4. Calculate Total Time Complexity**\nThe total time complexity `T(n)` is the sum of the time for each part:\n`T(n) = Time(Initialization) + Time(Loop) + Time(Return)`\n*   Time(Initialization) = `O(1)`\n*   Time(Return) = `O(1)`\n*   Time(Loop) = (Number of Iterations) × (Work per Iteration) = `O(log_c(n)) × O(1) = O(log_c(n))`\n\nSo, `T(n) = O(1) + O(log_c(n)) + O(1) = O(log_c(n))`.\n\n**5. Final Simplification (Convention in Big-O Notation)**\nIn Big-O notation, the base of a logarithm is typically omitted. This is because logarithms of different bases are related by a constant factor (`log_c(n) = log_b(n) / log_b(c)`), and constant factors are ignored in Big-O analysis. Since `c ≥ 2` is a constant, `log_b(c)` is also a constant.\nTherefore, the complexity `O(log_c(n))` is equivalent to `O(log n)`.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Model of Computation:** This analysis assumes a standard model where basic arithmetic on machine-sized integers takes constant time (`O(1)`). If `n` is an arbitrarily large number (requiring special bignum libraries), the cost of division and multiplication would depend on the number of bits in `n` (which is `O(log n)`), making the overall analysis more complex. However, for a typical algorithms course context, the `O(1)` assumption for arithmetic is standard.\n2.  **Input Variables:** The complexity is a function of the input size. Here, the primary variable that determines the number of operations is `n`. The base `c` affects the constant factor but not the logarithmic nature of the growth.\n3.  **Edge Cases:** For small `n` (e.g., `n < c`), the `while` loop does not execute at all. The algorithm finishes in constant time, `O(1)`. The `O(log n)` complexity is an asymptotic upper bound which correctly describes the algorithm's behavior as `n` grows large, and it also correctly bounds the constant time for small `n`.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the computational time complexity of the algorithm is determined by the number of divisions by the base `c`, which is logarithmic in `n`.\n\n<<<O(log n)>>>"
