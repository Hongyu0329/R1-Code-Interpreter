    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Core Question**\nThe question asks for the scientific genus name of a mushroom. The defining characteristic provided is that this genus is the only one known to produce a \"distinctly blue spore print.\" A spore print is a crucial identification tool in mycology, made by placing a mushroom cap on a surface to collect its spores, revealing their color in mass.\n\n**Step 2: Analyzing the Key Information**\n*   **\"Single genus\":** This implies the trait is unique to one particular genus, making the answer highly specific.\n*   **\"Distinctly blue spore print\":** This is the critical feature. Most spore prints are white, cream, pink, yellow, brown (in various shades), purple, or black. Blue is an exceedingly rare color for a spore print, and true blue is often considered non-existent by many amateur mycologists.\n\n**Step 3: Eliminating Common Misconceptions**\nIt is important to differentiate between mushrooms that *are* blue and mushrooms that *have blue spores*.\n*   ***Lactarius indigo***: This is the most famous blue mushroom. It has blue flesh and \"bleeds\" a blue latex-like milk. However, its spore print is creamy white to yellowish. Therefore, *Lactarius* is not the correct genus.\n*   ***Entoloma hochstetteri***: This New Zealand mushroom is famous for its vibrant, almost pure blue color. It is so iconic it appears on the New Zealand fifty-dollar note. However, like other members of its genus, it has a pink spore print. Therefore, *Entoloma* is not the correct genus.\n*   ***Psilocybe*** **and** ***Stropharia***: Some species in these genera have a dark purplish-brown to purplish-black spore print, which can have a slightly bluish tint in some lighting but is not considered \"distinctly blue.\"\n\n**Step 4: Identifying the Correct Genus through Specialized Knowledge**\nThe question requires deep or specialized mycological knowledge because the answer is not a commonly known genus for most hobbyists. Research into mycological literature and databases reveals that while true spectral blue is debatable, there is one genus noted for producing spore prints described as slate-blue, greyish-blue, or even blue.\n*   The genus is **Boletopsis**.\n*   This genus belongs to the \"polypore\" group of fungi, which have pores instead of gills, but a spore print can still be taken.\n*   Species such as *Boletopsis leucomelaena* (the black and white bolete) are specifically cited in technical mycological guides as having a spore print that is unusually colored, often described as slate-grey or greyish-blue. This is the \"distinctly blue\" print the question refers to, being unique in the fungal kingdom.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion**\nBased on the exclusion of more common blue-colored mushrooms and the identification of a specific genus known for this extremely rare spore print color in mycological literature, the correct answer is *Boletopsis*.\n\n<<<Boletopsis>>>"
