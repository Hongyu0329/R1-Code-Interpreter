    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the Line and Meter:**\n    The line to be scanned is \"et tibi bene esse soli quom sibi sit male\". This line is from Plautus and is a **Trochaic Septenarius**. A trochaic septenarius consists of seven and a half trochaic feet (`L S`). This means it has 15 metrical positions in its pure form (`L S | L S | L S | L S || L S | L S | L S | L`). The double vertical line `||` marks the main pause or **diæresis** after the fourth foot. In Plautine comedy, this meter is very flexible, allowing for common substitutions:\n    *   **Resolution:** A long syllable (`L`) can be \"resolved\" into two short ones (`S S`). This means a trochee (`L S`) can become a tribrach (`S S S`).\n    *   **Substitution:** A trochee (`L S`) can be replaced by a spondee (`L L`), an iamb (`S L` - usually in even-numbered feet), or a pyrrhic (`S S`).\n\n2.  **Syllabification and Basic Quantities:**\n    First, we determine the quantity (long `L` or short `S`) of each syllable.\n    *   `et`: Short vowel but long **by position** because it's followed by two consonants (`t` at the end of `et` and `t` at the start of `tibi`). -> **L**\n    *   `ti-bi`: Both `i`'s are short by nature and in open syllables. -> **S S**\n    *   `be-ne`: Both `e`'s are short by nature and in open syllables. -> **S S**\n    *   `es-se`: The first syllable `es-` is long **by position** because the short `e` is followed by a double consonant `ss`. The final syllable `-se` is short. -> **L S**\n    *   `so-li`: The `o` in `soli` is naturally long. The `i` is short. -> **L S**\n    *   `quom`: Archaic spelling of `cum`. The `o` is long. It is also long **by position** before the `s` of `sibi`. -> **L**\n    *   `si-bi`: Both `i`'s are short. -> **S S**\n    *   `sit`: The `i` is short, but the syllable is long **by position** because it is closed by `t` before the `m` of `male`. -> **L**\n    *   `ma-le`: Both vowels are short. -> **S S**\n\n3.  **Handling Elision vs. Hiatus:**\n    The sequence `...bene esse...` presents a classic case of a word ending in a vowel followed by a word beginning with a vowel. Normally, this would cause **elision**, where the first vowel is dropped (`ben' esse`), resulting in a 14-syllable line. However, scanning a 14-syllable line here leads to very difficult and irregular feet.\n    A common license in early Latin poetry is **hiatus**, the deliberate non-elision of the vowel, especially at a sense-break. Assuming hiatus keeps the line at 15 syllables, which perfectly matches the 15 positions of a trochaic septenarius catalectic, provided some feet have resolutions/substitutions. This path leads to a much cleaner scansion. We will proceed by assuming hiatus.\n\n4.  **Parsing into Metrical Feet (with Hiatus):**\n    With hiatus, the full sequence of syllables and quantities is:\n    `et ti-bi be-ne es-se so-li quom si-bi sit ma-le`\n    `L  S  S  S  S  L  S  L  S  L   S  S   L   S  S` (15 syllables total)\n\n    Now we group these into the 7.5 feet of the meter.\n\n    *   **Foot 1:** `et ti` -> **L S**. A standard **trochee**.\n    *   **Foot 2:** `bi be ne` -> **S S S**. This is a **tribrach**, a common resolution of a trochee (`L S` -> `S S S`).\n    *   **Foot 3:** `es se` -> **L S**. A standard **trochee**.\n    *   **Foot 4:** `so li` -> **L S**. A standard **trochee**. (This marks the diæresis/main pause).\n    *   **Foot 5:** `quom si` -> **L S**. A standard **trochee**.\n    *   **Foot 6:** `bi sit` -> **S L**. This is an **iamb**. Substitution of an iamb for a trochee is permitted in the even-numbered feet (2nd, 4th, 6th).\n    *   **Foot 7:** `ma le` -> **S S**. This is a **pyrrhic**. This substitution for a trochee is also a frequent license in Plautine meter.\n    *   **Catalexis:** The line is catalectic, meaning the final half-foot is omitted. The 7 full feet account for all 15 syllables, so this works as a complete trochaic septenarius line with substitutions.\n\n### Final Scansion\n\nBased on the analysis, the line is divided into feet as follows:\n\n`et ti | bi be ne | es se | so li | quom si | bi sit | ma le`\n\nThe resulting pattern of long and short syllables, with spaces between the feet, is:\n\n<<<L S S S S L S L S L S S L S S>>>"
