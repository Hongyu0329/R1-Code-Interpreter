    "### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Core Question:** The question asks for the most probable mechanism that explains why both copies of a duplicated gene are kept (retained) in the genome and why their sequences become different over time (diverge). This implies we are looking for a mechanism that confers a selective advantage to keeping both copies, thus preventing one from being lost through mutation (becoming a pseudogene).\n\n2.  **Evaluate Answer Choice A: Gene Conversion:**\n    *   **Definition:** Gene conversion is a non-reciprocal process where one DNA sequence replaces a homologous sequence. In the context of duplicate genes, one copy's sequence is \"copied over\" to the other.\n    *   **Effect:** This process leads to homogenization, making the duplicate genes more similar to each other.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Gene conversion actively works *against* divergence. Therefore, it is not the correct mechanism for retention *and divergence*.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Answer Choice B: Pseudogenization (Nonfunctionalization):**\n    *   **Definition:** After duplication, one copy of the gene is redundant. It is no longer under strong purifying selection and is free to accumulate mutations. Often, these mutations are deleterious and destroy the gene's function, turning it into a non-functional pseudogene.\n    *   **Effect:** This is the most common fate for a duplicate gene. It leads to the *loss* of one functional copy, not the *retention* of two. While it represents divergence (one copy diverges from a functional state), it fails the \"retention\" criterion.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This describes a loss of a duplicate, not its retention. Therefore, it is incorrect.\n\n4.  **Evaluate Answer Choice C: Neofunctionalization:**\n    *   **Definition:** In this model, one copy of the duplicate gene retains the original function, while the other, redundant copy, accumulates mutations that happen to create a new, beneficial function.\n    *   **Effect:** This model explains both retention and divergence. *Retention* occurs because the original gene is needed for its ancestral function, and the new gene is now needed for its new function. *Divergence* occurs as the new copy's sequence changes to optimize its new role.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This is a valid and important mechanism for the evolution of new genes. It is a strong candidate.\n\n5.  **Evaluate Answer Choice D: Subfunctionalization (DDC Model):**\n    *   **Definition:** This model proposes that the single ancestral gene had multiple functions or complex expression patterns (e.g., active in different tissues or at different times). After duplication, each copy accumulates degenerative mutations that inactivate a different *subset* of the original functions. For example, copy 1 loses function A but keeps function B, while copy 2 loses function B but keeps function A.\n    *   **Effect:** This model also explains both retention and divergence. *Retention* is necessary because both copies are now required to carry out the full set of the original ancestral functions. Losing either copy would be detrimental. *Divergence* occurs as each gene accumulates different mutations and specializes in its remaining subset of functions.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This is also a valid and important mechanism. It is a strong candidate.\n\n6.  **Evaluate Answer Choice E: Adaptive Radiation:**\n    *   **Definition:** Adaptive radiation is a macroevolutionary process where a single ancestral lineage rapidly diversifies into many new species, each adapted to a different ecological niche.\n    *   **Effect:** While gene duplication can provide the genetic raw material that facilitates adaptive radiation, adaptive radiation itself is a pattern of speciation and ecological diversification. It is not a molecular mechanism that acts on individual genes within a genome.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This answer operates at the wrong level of biological organization. It is incorrect.\n\n7.  **Compare the Strong Candidates: Neofunctionalization (C) vs. Subfunctionalization (D):**\n    *   The question asks for the mechanism that is \"**most likely**\" responsible.\n    *   **Neofunctionalization** requires a relatively *rare* event: a gain-of-function mutation that is beneficial. This must happen before the redundant gene copy is lost to pseudogenization, which is a common and rapid process.\n    *   **Subfunctionalization**, on the other hand, is driven by the accumulation of *common* degenerative mutations (loss-of-subfunction). This provides a more immediate, passive way to make both gene copies indispensable. Once each copy has lost a complementary part of the original function, natural selection will act to preserve both.\n    *   Because subfunctionalization relies on more common mutational events (neutral or slightly deleterious loss-of-function) to secure the retention of both copies, many evolutionary biologists consider it a more probable and frequent initial outcome for duplicate genes compared to the rarer event of acquiring a brand new function. It provides a more robust shield against the immediate threat of pseudogenization.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nBoth Neofunctionalization and Subfunctionalization explain the retention and divergence of duplicate genes. However, Subfunctionalization provides a more common and probable pathway for the initial *retention* of both copies, as it relies on more frequent degenerative mutations rather than rare beneficial gain-of-function mutations. Therefore, it is often considered the \"most likely\" mechanism for preserving duplicate genes in the genome.\n\n<<<D>>>"
