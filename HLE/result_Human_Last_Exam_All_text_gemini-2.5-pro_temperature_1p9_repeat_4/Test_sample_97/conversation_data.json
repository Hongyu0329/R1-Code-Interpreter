    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the solubility of Al(OH)₃ in pure water.\n\n### **Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n**1. Identify all relevant chemical equilibria.**\nWhen solid aluminum hydroxide, Al(OH)₃, is placed in pure water, it establishes two main equilibria simultaneously. Additionally, the autoionization of water is always present.\n\n*   **Dissolution Equilibrium (K_sp):** The solid dissolves to form aluminum ions and hydroxide ions.\n    Al(OH)₃(s) ⇌ Al³⁺(aq) + 3OH⁻(aq)\n    K_sp = [Al³⁺][OH⁻]³ = 5.3 * 10⁻²⁷\n\n*   **Complex Formation Equilibrium (K_f):** The dissolved aluminum ions react with hydroxide ions to form the tetrahydroxoaluminate(III) complex ion.\n    Al³⁺(aq) + 4OH⁻(aq) ⇌ Al(OH)₄⁻(aq)\n    K_f = [Al(OH)₄⁻] / ([Al³⁺][OH⁻]⁴) = 1.1 * 10³¹\n\n*   **Water Autoionization (K_w):** Water autoionizes to form hydrogen and hydroxide ions.\n    H₂O(l) ⇌ H⁺(aq) + OH⁻(aq)\n    K_w = [H⁺][OH⁻] = 1.0 * 10⁻¹⁴\n\n**2. Define the solubility (s).**\nThe molar solubility, *s*, is the total concentration of all dissolved aluminum-containing species at equilibrium.\ns = [Al³⁺] + [Al(OH)₄⁻]\n\n**3. Express aluminum species concentrations in terms of [OH⁻].**\nWe can use the equilibrium constant expressions to relate the concentrations of the aluminum species to the concentration of hydroxide ions.\n\n*   From the K_sp expression:\n    [Al³⁺] = K_sp / [OH⁻]³\n\n*   From the K_f expression:\n    [Al(OH)₄⁻] = K_f * [Al³⁺] * [OH⁻]⁴\n    Substituting the expression for [Al³⁺]:\n    [Al(OH)₄⁻] = K_f * (K_sp / [OH⁻]³) * [OH⁻]⁴\n    [Al(OH)₄⁻] = (K_sp * K_f) * [OH⁻]\n\n**4. Use the Charge Balance Equation to create a master equation.**\nFor any aqueous solution, the total positive charge must equal the total negative charge.\nTotal positive charge = 3[Al³⁺] + [H⁺]\nTotal negative charge = [OH⁻] + [Al(OH)₄⁻]\nCharge Balance Equation: 3[Al³⁺] + [H⁺] = [OH⁻] + [Al(OH)₄⁻]\n\nNow, substitute the expressions from Step 3 and the expression for [H⁺] (from K_w, [H⁺] = K_w / [OH⁻]) into the charge balance equation. This will give us a single equation with one unknown, [OH⁻].\n\n3 * (K_sp / [OH⁻]³) + (K_w / [OH⁻]) = [OH⁻] + (K_sp * K_f) * [OH⁻]\n\n**5. Solve the master equation for [OH⁻].**\nTo solve this equation, we can multiply the entire equation by [OH⁻]³ to eliminate the fractions:\n3*K_sp + K_w*[OH⁻]² = [OH⁻]⁴ + (K_sp * K_f)*[OH⁻]⁴\n\nRearrange the terms to form a standard polynomial equation:\n(1 + K_sp * K_f)*[OH⁻]⁴ - K_w*[OH⁻]² - 3*K_sp = 0\n\nThis is a biquadratic equation. Let's substitute `x = [OH⁻]²`. The equation becomes a standard quadratic equation in `x`:\n(1 + K_sp * K_f) * x² - K_w * x - 3*K_sp = 0\n\nNow, substitute the known values:\n*   K_sp = 5.3 * 10⁻²⁷\n*   K_f = 1.1 * 10³¹\n*   K_w = 1.0 * 10⁻¹⁴\n*   K_sp * K_f = (5.3 * 10⁻²⁷) * (1.1 * 10³¹) = 5.83 * 10⁴\n*   1 + K_sp * K_f = 1 + 5.83 * 10⁴ ≈ 5.83 * 10⁴\n*   3 * K_sp = 3 * (5.3 * 10⁻²⁷) = 1.59 * 10⁻²⁶\n\nThe quadratic equation is:\n(5.83 * 10⁴) * x² - (1.0 * 10⁻¹⁴) * x - (1.59 * 10⁻²⁶) = 0\n\nSolve for `x` using the quadratic formula `x = [-b ± sqrt(b² - 4ac)] / 2a`:\nx = [ -(-1.0*10⁻¹⁴) ± sqrt( (-1.0*10⁻¹⁴)² - 4 * (5.83*10⁴) * (-1.59*10⁻²⁶) ) ] / (2 * 5.83*10⁴)\nx = [ 1.0*10⁻¹⁴ ± sqrt( 1.0*10⁻²⁸ + 3.707*10⁻²¹ ) ] / (1.166 * 10⁵)\n\nInside the square root, 1.0*10⁻²⁸ is negligible compared to 3.707*10⁻²¹.\nx = [ 1.0*10⁻¹⁴ ± sqrt( 3.707*10⁻²¹ ) ] / (1.166 * 10⁵)\nx = [ 1.0*10⁻¹⁴ ± 6.089*10⁻¹¹ ] / (1.166 * 10⁵)\n\nSince `x = [OH⁻]²` must be a positive value, we take the positive root:\nx = (1.0*10⁻¹⁴ + 6.089*10⁻¹¹) / (1.166 * 10⁵)\nx ≈ (6.089 * 10⁻¹¹) / (1.166 * 10⁵)\nx ≈ 5.222 * 10⁻¹⁶\n\nNow find [OH⁻]:\n[OH⁻]² = x = 5.222 * 10⁻¹⁶ M²\n[OH⁻] = sqrt(5.222 * 10⁻¹⁶) = 2.285 * 10⁻⁸ M\n\n**6. Calculate the concentrations of the aluminum species.**\nUsing the value of [OH⁻] we just found:\n*   [Al³⁺] = K_sp / [OH⁻]³ = (5.3 * 10⁻²⁷) / (2.285 * 10⁻⁸)³\n    [Al³⁺] ≈ 4.44 * 10⁻⁴ M\n\n*   [Al(OH)₄⁻] = (K_sp * K_f) * [OH⁻] = (5.83 * 10⁴) * (2.285 * 10⁻⁸)\n    [Al(OH)₄⁻] ≈ 1.33 * 10⁻³ M\n\n**7. Calculate the total solubility (s).**\ns = [Al³⁺] + [Al(OH)₄⁻]\ns = (4.44 * 10⁻⁴) + (1.33 * 10⁻³)\ns = 0.000444 + 0.00133\ns = 0.001774 M\ns = 1.774 * 10⁻³ M\n\nConsidering the significant figures of the given constants (two), we should round the final answer.\ns ≈ 1.8 * 10⁻³ mol L⁻¹\n\n### **Careful Points**\n\n*   The solubility of amphoteric hydroxides like Al(OH)₃ is complex due to the simultaneous formation of the metal cation (Al³⁺) and the complex anion (Al(OH)₄⁻).\n*   Ignoring either of the dissolution pathways (simple K_sp or complex formation) leads to incorrect results.\n*   The charge balance equation is the most reliable method to set up the problem as it accounts for all ionic species present.\n*   Approximations in the charge balance equation can be misleading. A full, rigorous solution is necessary for accuracy. For example, assuming the solution is strongly acidic or strongly basic without justification can lead to contradictions.\n*   Be meticulous with algebraic manipulations, especially when clearing denominators and rearranging the master equation.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nThe final solubility of Al(OH)₃ in pure water is the sum of the concentrations of the dissolved aluminum species, calculated after solving for the equilibrium hydroxide concentration.\n\n<<<1.8 * 10^(-3)>>>"
