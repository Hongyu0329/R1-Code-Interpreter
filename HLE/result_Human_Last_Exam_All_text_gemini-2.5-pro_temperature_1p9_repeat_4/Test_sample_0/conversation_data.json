    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which condition of Arrhenius's sixth impossibility theorem is violated by critical-level views.\n\n### Step 1: Understand Arrhenius's Sixth Impossibility Theorem and Its Conditions\n\nArrhenius's sixth impossibility theorem in population ethics states that no single population axiology (a theory about how to rank populations by value) can simultaneously satisfy five seemingly plausible conditions. These conditions are:\n\n1.  **Weak Quality Addition (WQA):** If you add a person with a positive welfare level (a life worth living) to a population, the resulting population is better, all else being equal.\n2.  **Weak Non-Sadism (WNS):** Adding a person with a negative welfare level (a life not worth living) cannot make a population better.\n3.  **Non-Elitism (NE):** There exists some sufficiently high level of welfare such that an arbitrarily large population of people at that level is better than a population of a few \"elite\" individuals with extremely high welfare. This prevents giving absolute priority to the very best-off.\n4.  **General Non-Extreme Priority (GNEP):** For any two positive welfare levels, `u` and `v` where `u > v`, there is some number of lives at the lower level `v` that is better than one life at the higher level `u`. This prevents giving absolute priority to higher welfare levels.\n5.  **Egalitarian Dominance (ED):** If population A and B have the same number of people, everyone in A is better off than their counterpart in B, and welfare in A is distributed more equally than in B, then A is better than B.\n\nThe theorem's conclusion is that at least one of these desirable conditions must be abandoned.\n\n### Step 2: Understand Critical-Level Views\n\nA critical-level view is a type of population axiology that evaluates a population's value based on a \"critical level\" of welfare, which we will call `c`. The value of a population is calculated as the sum of each individual's welfare *minus* this critical level.\n\nValue(Population) = Σ (welfare_of_person_i - c)\n\n*   Adding a person with welfare `x` changes the population's value by `x - c`.\n*   If `x > c`, adding the person is an improvement.\n*   If `x < c`, adding the person makes the population worse.\n*   If `x = c`, adding the person makes no difference to the value.\n\nThe most discussed version of this view, designed to avoid the Repugnant Conclusion, uses a **positive critical level (c > 0)**. A welfare level of 0 is typically defined as the point where a life is neutral—neither worth living nor not worth living. So, a life with positive welfare (`x > 0`) is a life worth living for the person who lives it.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze which Condition is Violated by Critical-Level Views\n\nLet's test a critical-level view with a positive critical level (`c > 0`) against each of the five conditions.\n\n*   **A. Egalitarian Dominance:** This is satisfied. If everyone in population A is better off than in population B (with the same population size), then the sum of `(welfare - c)` will be higher for A than for B.\n*   **B. General Non-Extreme Priority:** This condition is **violated**. GNEP states that for *any* two positive welfare levels `u > v`, enough `v`-lives can outweigh one `u`-life. But with a critical-level view (c>0), we can choose levels such that `u > c > v > 0`.\n    *   The value of one life at level `u` is `u - c`, which is a positive number.\n    *   The value of `n` lives at level `v` is `n * (v - c)`, which is a negative number (since `v < c`).\n    *   A negative value can never be greater than a positive value. Therefore, no number of `v`-lives can be better than one `u`-life. Since this must hold for *any* `u` and `v`, and we found a case where it fails, GNEP is violated.\n*   **C. Non-Elitism:** This is satisfied. If we pick a mediocre welfare level `u` that is above the critical level (`u > c`), then adding people at this level contributes positively. We can always add enough of these people to outweigh the value contributed by any small, elite population.\n*   **D. Weak Non-Sadism:** This is satisfied (as long as `c ≥ 0`). WNS is about adding people with negative welfare (`x < 0`). Since `c` is positive, `x < 0 < c`, which means `x - c` is negative. Adding such a person always makes the population worse, which is consistent with WNS. (Note: A critical-level view with a *negative* critical level would violate WNS).\n*   **E. Weak Quality Addition:** This condition is **violated**. WQA states that adding *any* person with a positive welfare level (`x > 0`) is an improvement. However, a critical-level view with `c > 0` explicitly rejects this.\n    *   If we choose a positive welfare level `x` that is below the critical level (i.e., `0 < x < c`), adding this person makes the population worse.\n    *   The change in value is `x - c`, which is negative in this case.\n    *   This is in direct contradiction to WQA, which demands the outcome be better.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth General Non-Extreme Priority (GNEP) and Weak Quality Addition (WQA) are violated by standard critical-level views (where `c > 0`). However, the rejection of WQA is the definitional and foundational feature of these views. The entire point of introducing a positive critical level is to assert that not all positive lives (lives worth living) are good additions to the world; they must clear a higher bar (`c`). The violation of GNEP is a logical consequence of this core commitment. Because lives between 0 and `c` are deemed to have negative marginal value (the WQA violation), it naturally follows that piling up these \"negative\" additions cannot outweigh a positive one (the GNEP violation). Therefore, the most fundamental condition violated is Weak Quality Addition.\n\n<<<E>>>"
