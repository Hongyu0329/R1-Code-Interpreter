  "question": "In a recent excavation of an ancient Chinese tomb, people found two books called Ching and Shu. The Ching contains exactly 9999 symbols of yinyang-wuxing, such as yin-water or yang-fire. The Shu contains around 3000 ancient Chinese characters. Using advanced language modeling and computer vision technologies, people discover that the Shu is written with only 120 most common Chinese characters at that time. The computer vision tool can recognize such a character in 12 ms. Computation time for each operation on integers and floats is 10 ns and 30 ns, respectively.\n\nPeople believe that the Ching has a secret message encrypted with its symbols. This message is also written using the letters in the Shu. What is the max length of this message?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>.",

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the maximum length of the secret message.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the components of the encoding system\n\n1.  **The Encoded Medium (Source):** The book \"Ching\" contains the raw data for the message. It has exactly 9999 symbols.\n2.  **The Alphabet of the Encoded Medium:** The symbols are of the \"yinyang-wuxing\" type.\n    *   \"Yinyang\" has two states: yin and yang.\n    *   \"Wuxing\" (The Five Elements) has five states: typically wood, fire, earth, metal, and water.\n    *   Therefore, each symbol can be one of 2 (yin/yang) × 5 (wuxing) = **10 unique types**. This means we have a base-10 encoding system.\n3.  **The Message Alphabet (Target):** The secret message is written using the 120 most common Chinese characters found in the book \"Shu\". This means our target message is composed of characters from an alphabet of size **120**.\n4.  **Irrelevant Information (Red Herrings):**\n    *   The total number of characters in Shu (\"around 3000\") is irrelevant; only the size of the character set used for the message (120) matters.\n    *   The computation times (12 ms, 10 ns, 30 ns) are distractors related to technology and have no bearing on the information-theoretic limit of the message length.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the encoding requirements\n\nThe core of the problem is to figure out how many Ching symbols are needed to represent a single character from the Shu's alphabet.\n\n1.  We have 10 types of Ching symbols to work with.\n2.  We need to represent 120 different message characters.\n3.  Let `n` be the number of Ching symbols we group together to form a \"code\" for one message character. The number of unique codes we can create with `n` symbols is `10^n`.\n4.  We must find the smallest integer `n` such that the number of possible codes is greater than or equal to the number of characters we need to represent. Mathematically:\n    `10^n ≥ 120`\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the minimum number of symbols per character\n\nLet's test values for `n`:\n*   If `n = 1`: `10^1 = 10`. This is less than 120, so one Ching symbol is not enough to distinguish between all 120 message characters.\n*   If `n = 2`: `10^2 = 100`. This is also less than 120, so two Ching symbols are still not enough.\n*   If `n = 3`: `10^3 = 1000`. This is greater than 120, which is sufficient. We can assign a unique 3-symbol code to each of the 120 message characters (with many codes left unused).\n\nTherefore, we need a block of **3 Ching symbols** to encode **one message character**.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the maximum length of the message\n\nNow that we know the encoding ratio (3 Ching symbols per message character), we can find the total length of the message.\n\n1.  Total available symbols from the Ching book = 9999.\n2.  Symbols required per message character = 3.\n3.  Maximum message length = (Total available symbols) / (Symbols per character)\n4.  Maximum message length = 9999 / 3 = 3333.\n\nThe entire sequence of 9999 Ching symbols can be divided into 3333 blocks of 3 symbols each. Each block represents one character of the secret message, resulting in a message that is 3333 characters long.\n\n<<<3333>>>"
