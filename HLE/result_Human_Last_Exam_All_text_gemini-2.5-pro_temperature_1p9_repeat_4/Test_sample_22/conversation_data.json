    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the statement.\n\n**1. Deconstruction of the Core Concepts:**\n\n*   **Phenotype:** An observable trait of an individual, like height, blood pressure, or risk for a disease. The variation we see in this trait among people is called phenotypic variance.\n*   **SNP Heritability (h²_SNP):** This is a theoretical concept. It represents the proportion of the total phenotypic variance in a population that can be explained by the combined *additive* effects of all common Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) across the genome. It is the theoretical *upper limit* or ceiling for how much variance can be explained *if* we knew the true, exact effect of every single SNP on the phenotype. It's a measure of the total genetic signal present in the SNPs, not a measure of our ability to predict the phenotype.\n*   **Polygenic Score (PGS):** This is a practical, predictive tool. It's a score calculated for an individual that summarizes their estimated genetic predisposition for a phenotype. It is built by taking a weighted sum of their risk alleles. The \"weights\" are the estimated effect sizes for each SNP, which are derived from a Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS).\n*   **Predictive Ability of a PGS (measured by variance explained, R²):** This measures how well the PGS actually predicts the phenotype in a new group of people (i.e., not the one used to create the PGS). It is calculated as the proportion of phenotypic variance that is statistically explained by the PGS. This is often denoted as R².\n\n**2. Careful Points and Analysis of the Relationship:**\n\n*   **Theoretical Ceiling vs. Practical Application:** The key distinction is that SNP heritability (h²_SNP) is a theoretical *ceiling*, while the variance explained by a PGS (R²) is a measure of *achieved* practical performance. The PGS is our attempt to capture the signal that h²_SNP describes.\n*   **Imperfect Information:** A PGS is built using effect size estimates from a GWAS. These estimates are not perfect; they are \"noisy\" because GWAS are conducted on finite samples of people. The smaller the GWAS sample, the noisier (less accurate) the effect size estimates will be.\n*   **Statistical Limitations:** The methods used to combine these noisy estimates into a single PGS also have limitations. They must account for the complex correlation structure between SNPs (Linkage Disequilibrium) and decide which SNPs to include. No method is perfect.\n*   **The Inevitable Gap:** Because the PGS is constructed with imperfect (noisy effect sizes) and incomplete (not all causal SNPs may be included or weighted perfectly) information, its ability to explain variance (R²) in a new sample will inevitably be less than the total variance that could theoretically be explained by the SNPs (h²_SNP). The PGS is an imperfect approximation of the ideal genetic predictor. The performance of an approximation cannot exceed the performance of the ideal it is approximating.\n*   **Analogy:** Imagine SNP heritability is the total amount of gold buried in a field. A PGS is the amount of gold you can find using a particular metal detector (the GWAS) and a specific digging strategy (the PGS statistical method). Your metal detector isn't perfect; it might miss some gold and give false signals. Your digging strategy might not be optimal. Therefore, the amount of gold you actually dig up (variance explained by PGS) will necessarily be less than the total amount of gold actually in the field (SNP heritability). As your technology (GWAS sample size) improves, you get closer to finding all the gold, but you can never find more gold than is there.\n\n**3. Conclusion**\n\nThe SNP heritability sets the theoretical maximum predictive power for any predictor based on the additive effects of SNPs. The polygenic score is such a predictor, but it is built with imperfect data (estimated effect sizes from finite GWAS). Therefore, its predictive performance must be lower than the theoretical maximum. The word \"necessarily\" is appropriate because the practical performance of an estimator built on noisy data cannot exceed the theoretical limit defined by perfect data.\n\n<<<True>>>"
