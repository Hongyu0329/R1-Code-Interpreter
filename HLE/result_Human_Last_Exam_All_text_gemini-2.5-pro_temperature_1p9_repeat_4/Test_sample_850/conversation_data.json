    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruction of the Question and Definitions\n\nThe question asks to identify crystal classes that satisfy three conditions simultaneously:\n1.  **Achiral:** The crystal structure can be superimposed on its mirror image. In terms of symmetry, this means the crystal's point group must contain at least one roto-inversion operation. Roto-inversion axes are denoted as \\bar{n}. This category includes a center of inversion (\\bar{1}, also denoted as 'i') and a mirror plane (\\bar{2}, also denoted as 'm').\n2.  **Non-polar:** The crystal does not have a unique direction (a polar axis) where the properties at one end are different from the other. Symmetry elements like a center of inversion or a mirror plane perpendicular to a rotation axis forbid polarity. The 10 polar crystal classes are 1, 2, m, mm2, 3, 3m, 4, 4mm, 6, 6mm. All other 22 classes are non-polar.\n3.  **Correct symmetry for optical activity:** Optical activity is the ability of a material to rotate the plane of polarized light. For a crystal to be optically active, it must be chiral. This means its point group symmetry must **not** contain any roto-inversion axes (no center of inversion 'i' or mirror plane 'm').\n\n### Step 2: Identifying the Careful Points and Contradiction\n\nA careful analysis of the definitions reveals a fundamental contradiction within the question's premises.\n\n*   Condition #1 requires the crystal class to be **achiral**. This means its symmetry must include a mirror plane or a center of inversion (or any other roto-inversion axis).\n*   Condition #3 requires the crystal class to have the correct symmetry for **optical activity**. This is possible only if the class is **chiral**, meaning its symmetry must *not* include any mirror planes or a center of inversion.\n\nA crystal class cannot be both achiral and chiral at the same time. Therefore, based on a literal interpretation of the established definitions in crystallography and physics, there are **no crystal classes** that can satisfy all three conditions. The set of achiral classes and the set of optically active classes are mutually exclusive.\n\n### Step 3: Proposing a Plausible Reinterpretation\n\nGiven the contradiction, it is highly likely that the question contains a subtle error in terminology. A common point of confusion is between optical activity and other optical phenomena that are also forbidden in crystals with a center of inversion. One such key property is being **non-centrosymmetric** (lacking a center of inversion, 'i').\n\nThe absence of an inversion center is a prerequisite for:\n*   Optical Activity (but being non-centrosymmetric is not sufficient; the stricter condition of chirality is needed).\n*   Piezoelectricity.\n*   Second Harmonic Generation (SHG).\n*   The Pockels (linear electro-optic) effect.\n\nIt is plausible that the question mistakenly used \"correct symmetry for optical activity\" when it intended to ask for **non-centrosymmetric** classes. We will proceed with this reinterpretation.\n\nThe reformulated question is: **\"What achiral and non-polar crystal classes are non-centrosymmetric?\"**\n\n### Step 4: Step-by-Step Analysis with the Reformulated Question\n\nWe will now filter the 32 crystal point groups based on the three revised criteria:\n1.  **Non-centrosymmetric:** Must not have a center of inversion (\\bar{1}).\n2.  **Achiral:** Must have a roto-inversion axis (like 'm' or \\bar{n}).\n3.  **Non-polar:** Must not be one of the 10 polar classes.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Start with all 32 crystal classes.**\n\n2.  **Apply the \"Non-centrosymmetric\" condition.** We eliminate the 11 centrosymmetric classes: \\bar{1}, 2/m, mmm, \\bar{3}, \\bar{3}m, 4/m, 4/mmm, 6/m, 6/mmm, m\\bar{3}, m\\bar{3}m. This leaves the 21 non-centrosymmetric classes.\n\n3.  **Apply the \"Achiral\" condition.** From the 21 non-centrosymmetric classes, we must select those that have a roto-inversion axis. This eliminates the 11 chiral classes (1, 2, 222, 3, 32, 4, 422, 6, 622, 23, 432), as they lack such symmetry by definition. This leaves us with 10 non-centrosymmetric, achiral classes: m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, 6mm, \\bar{4}, \\bar{6}, \\bar{4}2m, \\bar{6}m2, \\bar{4}3m.\n\n4.  **Apply the \"Non-polar\" condition.** From this list of 10 classes, we must eliminate any that are polar. The polar classes are {1, 2, m, mm2, 3, 3m, 4, 4mm, 6, 6mm}. The classes from our list that are polar are m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, and 6mm. Removing these leaves the final set.\n\n### Step 5: The Final Answer\n\nThe crystal classes that are achiral, non-polar, and non-centrosymmetric (our interpreted meaning) are the ones remaining after the filtering process. These are:\n*   **\\bar{4}** (Schoenflies notation: S₄)\n*   **\\bar{6}** (Schoenflies notation: C₃ₕ)\n*   **\\bar{4}2m** (Schoenflies notation: D₂d)\n*   **\\bar{6}m2** (Schoenflies notation: D₃ₕ)\n*   **\\bar{4}3m** (Schoenflies notation: T_d)\n\nThese five classes satisfy all three conditions under the plausible reinterpretation of the question. Under the literal interpretation, the answer is \"none\".\n\n<<<\\bar{4}, \\bar{6}, \\bar{4}2m, \\bar{6}m2, \\bar{4}3m>>>"
