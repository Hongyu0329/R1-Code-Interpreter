    "The question asks for the number of Triple Crown winners in MLB baseball. This requires a careful analysis of the definition of the Triple Crown and a review of MLB history to count the individual players who have achieved this feat.\n\n### Step 1: Define the \"Triple Crown\"\nIn Major League Baseball, there are two types of Triple Crowns: one for batting and one for pitching.\n*   **Batting Triple Crown:** A player must lead their respective league (American League or National League) in batting average, home runs, and runs batted in (RBIs) in the same season.\n*   **Pitching Triple Crown:** A player must lead their respective league in wins, strikeouts, and earned run average (ERA) in the same season.\n\nTypically, when the term \"Triple Crown\" is used without qualification, it refers to the **batting Triple Crown**, as it is a rarer and more celebrated achievement. The analysis will focus on this interpretation but acknowledge the pitching version.\n\n### Step 2: Identify Careful Points and Historical Considerations\n1.  **Winners vs. Instances:** The question asks for \"how many winners,\" which implies counting the number of unique players, not the total number of times the feat has been accomplished. Some players have won it more than once.\n2.  **Historical Record Accuracy:** Early baseball records can be inconsistent. There are a few instances of Triple Crowns that are disputed by modern statisticians. Official sources like the Elias Sports Bureau (MLB's official statistician) should be deferred to.\n    *   **Paul Hines (1878):** While some sources list him as a winner, his home run total is disputed. Official MLB records do not recognize his Triple Crown.\n    *   **Heinie Zimmerman (1912):** Led the NL in home runs and RBIs but finished second in batting average according to modern calculations. He is not officially recognized as a Triple Crown winner.\n3.  **Ties:** A player who ties for the league lead in a statistical category is still considered a league leader. This is relevant for some winners.\n4.  **Scope:** The count should include winners from both the American League and National League, as well as their officially recognized predecessor leagues like the American Association.\n\n### Step 3: Step-by-Step Analysis to List Batting Triple Crown Winners\nWe will list the officially recognized Triple Crown winners and then count the number of unique individuals.\n\n1.  **Tip O'Neill (1887)** - St. Louis Browns (American Association)\n2.  **Hugh Duffy (1894)** - Boston Beaneaters (National League)\n3.  **Nap Lajoie (1901)** - Philadelphia Athletics (American League)\n4.  **Ty Cobb (1909)** - Detroit Tigers (American League)\n5.  **Rogers Hornsby (1922 & 1925)** - St. Louis Cardinals (National League)\n    *   *Note: This is one player who won it twice.*\n6.  **Chuck Klein (1933)** - Philadelphia Phillies (National League)\n7.  **Jimmie Foxx (1933)** - Philadelphia Athletics (American League)\n8.  **Lou Gehrig (1934)** - New York Yankees (American League)\n9.  **Joe Medwick (1937)** - St. Louis Cardinals (National League)\n10. **Ted Williams (1942 & 1947)** - Boston Red Sox (American League)\n    *   *Note: This is the second player to win it twice.*\n11. **Mickey Mantle (1956)** - New York Yankees (American League)\n12. **Frank Robinson (1966)** - Baltimore Orioles (American League)\n13. **Carl Yastrzemski (1967)** - Boston Red Sox (American League)\n14. **Miguel Cabrera (2012)** - Detroit Tigers (American League)\n\n### Step 4: Acquire the Final Answer\nBy counting the unique players on the list above, we can determine the final number.\n\n*   The list contains 14 distinct names.\n*   While the batting Triple Crown has been achieved 16 times, it has been won by only **14** different players, as Rogers Hornsby and Ted Williams each won it twice.\n\nTherefore, the number of Triple Crown winners (for batting) in MLB history is 14.\n\nFor completeness, there are 25 different players who have won the pitching Triple Crown, with no overlap between the two lists. However, the standard answer to this question refers to the batters.\n\n<<<14>>>"
