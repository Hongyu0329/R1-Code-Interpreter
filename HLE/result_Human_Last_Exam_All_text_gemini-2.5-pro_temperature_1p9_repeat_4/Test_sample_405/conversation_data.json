    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Question\n\nThe question asks for the number of different colors that can be observed in the *pure allotropes* of the element phosphorus.\n-   **Allotropes:** These are different structural modifications of an element. The atoms are arranged differently, leading to different physical and chemical properties, including color.\n-   **Pure:** This is a critical point. We must only consider the color of the pure substance itself, not colors that arise from impurities, mixtures of allotropes, or chemical reactions (like chemiluminescence).\n-   **Observed:** This implies that the allotrope is stable enough to be characterized and its color noted, even if it's not common in everyday applications. This includes recently discovered forms like 2D materials.\n\n### Step 2: Listing the Allotropes of Phosphorus and Their Colors\n\nWe will go through the known allotropes of phosphorus one by one.\n\n1.  **White Phosphorus ($P_4$)**\n    *   **Structure:** Consists of tetrahedral $P_4$ molecules.\n    *   **Color:** When perfectly pure, it is a colorless or **White** waxy solid.\n    *   **Careful Point:** It is often called \"yellow phosphorus\" because it quickly turns yellowish upon exposure to light. This yellowing is due to a slow conversion to the more stable red phosphorus. Therefore, yellow is the color of an impure sample, not a pure allotrope. We count the color of the pure form, which is white.\n    *   **Color Count: 1 (White)**\n\n2.  **Red Phosphorus**\n    *   **Structure:** It is a polymer, with a complex, amorphous (non-crystalline) structure.\n    *   **Color:** As the name suggests, its color is **Red**. The exact shade can vary from orange-red to dark red depending on the specific preparation method and particle size.\n    *   **Color Count: 2 (White, Red)**\n\n3.  **Scarlet Phosphorus**\n    *   **Structure:** An amorphous form obtained by allowing a solution of white phosphorus in carbon disulfide to evaporate in sunlight. It is considered a more reactive variant of red phosphorus.\n    *   **Color:** It has a distinct **Scarlet** (bright red) color. Although related to red phosphorus, it is often listed as a distinct form due to its preparation and properties.\n    *   **Color Count: 3 (White, Red, Scarlet)**\n\n4.  **Violet Phosphorus (Hittorf's Metallic Phosphorus)**\n    *   **Structure:** It has a complex, crystalline (monoclinic) structure consisting of interconnected tubes.\n    *   **Color:** It is a crystalline solid with a deep reddish-**Violet** or purple color. It is much more stable than red phosphorus. Its distinct crystalline nature and color separate it from amorphous red phosphorus.\n    *   **Color Count: 4 (White, Red, Scarlet, Violet)**\n\n5.  **Black Phosphorus**\n    *   **Structure:** It is the most thermodynamically stable form of phosphorus. It has a layered, puckered honeycomb structure (orthorhombic).\n    *   **Color:** It is **Black** and flaky, with a metallic luster, similar in appearance to graphite.\n    *   **Color Count: 5 (White, Red, Scarlet, Violet, Black)**\n\n6.  **Blue Phosphorus (Phosphorene)**\n    *   **Structure:** A more recently synthesized two-dimensional (2D) allotrope, analogous to graphene. It consists of a single layer of phosphorus atoms in a honeycomb-like structure.\n    *   **Color:** As its name implies, it has a characteristic **Blue** color.\n    *   **Color Count: 6 (White, Red, Scarlet, Violet, Black, Blue)**\n\n7.  **Green Phosphorus (Phosphorene)**\n    *   **Structure:** Another recently discovered 2D allotrope, which is an isomer of blue phosphorus with a different atomic arrangement within its layer.\n    *   **Color:** This allotrope exhibits a **Green** color.\n    *   **Careful Point:** This should not be confused with the greenish glow (chemiluminescence) produced when white phosphorus oxidizes in the air. That glow is light from a chemical reaction, not the color of the phosphorus itself. Green phosphorus is a distinct, stable allotrope.\n    *   **Color Count: 7 (White, Red, Scarlet, Violet, Black, Blue, Green)**\n\n### Step 3: Summary of Careful Points\n\n*   **Purity:** Exclude colors from impurities or degradation. \"Yellow\" phosphorus is excluded because it's white phosphorus with traces of red phosphorus.\n*   **Distinct Forms:** Allotropes with different structures are counted, even if their elemental composition is the same. This includes amorphous vs. crystalline forms (Red vs. Violet) and 2D isomers (Blue vs. Green).\n*   **Scope:** The count includes both classical, bulk allotropes and recently synthesized but confirmed 2D allotropes (phosphorenes).\n*   **Phenomena vs. Inherent Color:** The greenish glow of oxidizing white phosphorus is a chemical phenomenon (chemiluminescence) and not the inherent color of an allotrope.\n\n### Step 4: Final Conclusion\n\nBy systematically analyzing each pure allotrope of phosphorus, we identify a distinct color for each one. The tally of these unique colors is:\n1.  White\n2.  Red\n3.  Scarlet\n4.  Violet\n5.  Black\n6.  Blue\n7.  Green\n\nTherefore, a total of 7 distinct colors can be observed in the pure allotropes of phosphorus.\n\n<<<7>>>"
