No, polynucleotides (including homopolynucleotides) are not structurally polysaccharides. They differ in their basic monomeric unit (nucleotide vs. monosaccharide), backbone composition (sugar-phosphate vs. sugar-only), and the type of covalent bond linking the monomers (phosphodiester vs. glycosidic).
