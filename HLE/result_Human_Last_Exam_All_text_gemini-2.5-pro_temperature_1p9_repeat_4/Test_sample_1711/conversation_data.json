    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the group G and its cyclic subgroups**\n\nThe group is $G = (\\mathbb{Z}/49\\mathbb{Z})^{2024}$. This is a finite abelian group under component-wise addition. The identity element is the zero vector, $0_G = (0, 0, \\ldots, 0)$.\nA cyclic subgroup of $G$ is a subgroup generated by a single element $g \\in G$. We denote it as $\\langle g \\rangle = \\{k \\cdot g \\mid k \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}$.\nThe question asks for the smallest size of a set $A \\subset G$ with the property that for every cyclic subgroup $H$ of $G$, the intersection $A \\cap H$ is not empty.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the property of the set A**\n\nThe condition is that for every $g \\in G$, the set $A \\cap \\langle g \\rangle$ must be non-empty. This must hold for all elements $g$, including the identity element $g = 0_G$.\n\n**Step 3: Identify a common element in all cyclic subgroups**\n\nLet's recall the fundamental properties of a subgroup. By definition, any subgroup of a group must contain the identity element of that group.\nIn our case, any cyclic subgroup $H = \\langle g \\rangle$ is, by definition, a subgroup of $G$. Therefore, every cyclic subgroup $H$ must contain the identity element of $G$, which is $0_G$.\n\n**Step 4: Construct a candidate set A and check its validity**\n\nBased on the observation in Step 3, the identity element $0_G$ is present in every single cyclic subgroup of $G$. This suggests a very simple choice for the set $A$.\nLet's propose the set $A = \\{0_G\\}$. The size of this set is $|A|=1$.\n\nLet's verify if this set satisfies the required property. The property is that for any cyclic subgroup $H$, $A \\cap H \\neq \\emptyset$.\nLet $H$ be an arbitrary cyclic subgroup of $G$.\nThe intersection of $A$ and $H$ is $A \\cap H = \\{0_G\\} \\cap H$.\nAs we established in Step 3, $0_G$ is an element of every subgroup $H$. Therefore, the intersection is $\\{0_G\\}$.\nThe set $\\{0_G\\}$ is not the empty set. Thus, the condition $A \\cap H \\neq \\emptyset$ is satisfied for every cyclic subgroup $H$.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the minimality of the size**\n\nWe have found a set $A = \\{0_G\\}$ of size 1 that satisfies the condition.\nTo find the *smallest* size, we need to know if a set of size 0 would work. A set of size 0 is the empty set, $\\emptyset$.\nIf we choose $A=\\emptyset$, the intersection with any subgroup $H$ would be $\\emptyset \\cap H = \\emptyset$. This does not satisfy the condition $A \\cap H \\neq \\emptyset$.\nTherefore, the set $A$ must be non-empty, which means its size must be at least 1.\nSince we found a valid set of size 1, and we know the minimum size is at least 1, the smallest possible size for $A$ is 1.\n\n**Step 6: Careful points and potential misinterpretations**\n\nIt is important to read mathematical questions literally. The complex structure of the group $G = (\\mathbb{Z}/49\\mathbb{Z})^{2024}$ might suggest that a complex calculation involving the number of subgroups of different orders is necessary. However, the question is a basic one about the definition of a subgroup.\n\n*   **\"Every cyclic subgroup\"**: This wording includes the trivial subgroup $\\{0_G\\}$. The proposed set $A=\\{0_G\\}$ correctly intersects this subgroup.\n*   **\"Contains at least one element\"**: This does not mean the element must be a generator or a non-zero element. The element can be any element in the subgroup, including the identity.\n\nIf the problem were intended to be more complex, it would need to be phrased differently, for example: \"every *non-trivial* cyclic subgroup $H$ must have a *non-zero* intersection with $A$\". This would be a different problem (a hitting set problem on the set of non-trivial cyclic subgroups), leading to a much larger answer, namely $\\frac{7^{2024}-1}{6}$. However, this is not what was asked. The question is stated in a way that allows for the simplest possible answer.\n\nBased on a literal and careful reading of the problem statement, the detailed structure of $G$ is a distraction from the core logical point.\n\nFinal answer:\nThe identity element $0_G$ is an element of every subgroup of $G$, and therefore of every cyclic subgroup of $G$.\nLet $A = \\{0_G\\}$. The size of $A$ is 1.\nFor any cyclic subgroup $H$ of $G$, we have $0_G \\in H$.\nThus, $A \\cap H = \\{0_G\\} \\cap H = \\{0_G\\}$, which is not the empty set.\nSo, the set $A = \\{0_G\\}$ fulfills the condition.\nSince $|A|$ must be at least 1, the smallest possible size is 1.\n\n<<<1>>>"
