    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the cardinality of the set of continuous functions $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ that satisfy the equation $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the properties of the function f\nLet $S$ be the set of continuous functions $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ such that $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$. We need to find the cardinality of $S$, denoted by $|S|$.\n\nLet $g(x) = \\exp(x)$. The equation is $f \\circ f = g$.\n\n1.  **Injectivity of f**:\n    Suppose $f(x_1) = f(x_2)$ for some $x_1, x_2 \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n    Applying the function $f$ to both sides, we get $f(f(x_1)) = f(f(x_2))$.\n    From the given equation, this means $\\exp(x_1) = \\exp(x_2)$.\n    Since the exponential function $\\exp(x)$ is strictly increasing, it is injective. Therefore, $x_1 = x_2$.\n    This shows that $f$ must be an injective (one-to-one) function.\n\n2.  **Monotonicity of f**:\n    A fundamental theorem in real analysis states that a continuous and injective function on an interval must be strictly monotonic. Since the domain of $f$ is $\\mathbb{R}$ (which is an interval), $f$ must be either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the case where f is strictly decreasing\nLet's assume that $f$ is a strictly decreasing continuous function from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\n1.  **Asymptotic behavior**: Since $f$ is a strictly decreasing continuous function defined on all of $\\mathbb{R}$, it must be a bijection from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$. This implies that $\\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} f(x) = +\\infty$ and $\\lim_{x \\to \\infty} f(x) = -\\infty$.\n\n2.  **Existence of a fixed point**: Consider the auxiliary function $h(x) = f(x) - x$.\n    *   $h(x)$ is continuous because both $f(x)$ and $-x$ are continuous.\n    *   Let's analyze the limits of $h(x)$:\n        *   $\\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} h(x) = \\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} (f(x) - x) = (+\\infty) - (-\\infty) = +\\infty$.\n        *   $\\lim_{x \\to \\infty} h(x) = \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} (f(x) - x) = (-\\infty) - (+\\infty) = -\\infty$.\n    *   Since $h(x)$ is continuous and goes from $+\\infty$ to $-\\infty$, by the Intermediate Value Theorem, there must exist at least one point $x_0 \\in \\mathbb{R}$ such that $h(x_0) = 0$.\n    *   $h(x_0)=0$ implies $f(x_0) - x_0 = 0$, which means $f(x_0) = x_0$. So, any strictly decreasing continuous function from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$ must have at least one fixed point.\n\n3.  **Contradiction**: Now, let's see what having a fixed point implies for the original equation.\n    *   Suppose $f$ has a fixed point $x_0$, so $f(x_0) = x_0$.\n    *   Applying $f$ again: $f(f(x_0)) = f(x_0) = x_0$.\n    *   From the original equation, we have $f(f(x_0)) = \\exp(x_0)$.\n    *   Therefore, we must have $x_0 = \\exp(x_0)$.\n    *   However, the equation $x = e^x$ has no real solutions. We can see this by considering the function $k(x) = e^x - x$. Its derivative is $k'(x) = e^x - 1$, which is zero only at $x=0$. The minimum value is $k(0) = e^0 - 0 = 1$. Since the minimum value is positive, $e^x-x > 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$, so $e^x$ is never equal to $x$.\n\n4.  **Conclusion for this case**: The assumption that $f$ is strictly decreasing leads to a contradiction. Therefore, there are no strictly decreasing continuous functions satisfying the given equation.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the case where f is strictly increasing\nNow, we only need to consider strictly increasing continuous functions $f$.\n\n1.  **Relation between f(x) and x**:\n    *   Since $f$ is strictly increasing, if $f(x_0) \\le x_0$ for some $x_0$, then applying $f$ would give $f(f(x_0)) \\le f(x_0) \\le x_0$. This would mean $\\exp(x_0) \\le x_0$, which we already know is false for all $x_0 \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n    *   Therefore, it must be the case that $f(x) > x$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\n2.  **Constructing solutions**:\n    The standard method for constructing solutions to functional equations like $f(f(x)) = g(x)$ (where $g(x)>x$) involves defining $f$ on a fundamental interval and then extending it uniquely.\n    *   Pick an arbitrary point $x_0 \\in \\mathbb{R}$, say $x_0 = 0$.\n    *   This defines a sequence of points under the action of $g(x) = e^x$: ..., $\\ln(\\ln(1))$ (undefined), $\\ln(1)=0$, $e^0=1$, $e^1=e$, $e^e$, ...\n    *   Let's pick two consecutive points in such a sequence, for example $x_0=1$ and $g(x_0)=e$. The interval is $[1, e)$.\n    *   We need to define $f$ on this interval. Since $f(f(x)) = e^x$ and $f(x)>x$, for any $x \\in [1, e)$, we must have $f(x) \\in [e, e^e)$. More precisely, $f$ must map the interval $[1, e]$ onto the interval $[e, e^e]$. Wait, that's not right.\n    *   Let's use a better construction. Choose an arbitrary starting point $x_0$. Since $f(x)>x$, we have $x_0 < f(x_0) < f(f(x_0)) = \\exp(x_0)$.\n    *   Let's pick an arbitrary $x_0 \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n    *   Choose an arbitrary value $y_0$ such that $x_0 < y_0 < \\exp(x_0)$.\n    *   We define $f$ on the interval $[x_0, y_0]$ as follows:\n        a. Set $f(x_0) = y_0$.\n        b. Set $f(y_0) = \\exp(x_0)$.\n        c. For $x \\in (x_0, y_0)$, we need to define $f(x)$ such that it maps $[x_0, y_0]$ to $[y_0, \\exp(x_0)]$ in a strictly increasing, continuous manner. Let's define $f(x)$ on $[x_0, y_0]$ to be any strictly increasing continuous function $\\phi(x)$ such that $\\phi(x_0)=y_0$ and $\\phi(y_0)=\\exp(x_0)$.\n    *   The choice of such a function $\\phi$ is not unique. A function is specified once we define its graph. We are essentially choosing an arbitrary continuous increasing curve connecting the point $(x_0, y_0)$ to $(y_0, \\exp(x_0))$.\n\n3.  **Cardinality of the solutions**:\n    *   Let's simplify the choice of $\\phi$. A homeomorphism (a continuous bijection with a continuous inverse) from $[a, b]$ to $[c, d]$ that maps $a \\to c$ and $b \\to d$ can be constructed. By mapping both intervals to $[0,1]$, we are essentially counting the number of strictly increasing homeomorphisms $\\psi: [0,1] \\to [0,1]$ with $\\psi(0)=0, \\psi(1)=1$.\n    *   Let's show that there are at least $\\mathfrak{c}$ (the cardinality of the continuum, $|\\mathbb{R}|$) such functions. Let $x_0=0$ and $\\exp(x_0)=1$. We must choose $y_0 \\in (0,1)$. Let's fix $y_0 = 1/2$.\n    *   We need to define a strictly increasing continuous function $\\phi: [0, 1/2] \\to [1/2, 1]$.\n    *   We can specify the value of this function at an intermediate point, say $x=1/4$. Let $\\phi(1/4) = c$. For $\\phi$ to be strictly increasing, we must choose $c$ from the interval $(\\phi(0), \\phi(1/2)) = (1/2, 1)$.\n    *   There are $\\mathfrak{c}$ choices for $c \\in (1/2, 1)$. For each such choice, we can build a unique function $\\phi_c$ (for instance, by using two line segments to connect $(0, 1/2)$ to $(1/4, c)$ and $(1/4, c)$ to $(1/2, 1)$). Each such $\\phi_c$ generates a different function $f_c$, since $f_c(1/4) = c$ differs for each choice.\n    *   This construction shows there is an injective mapping from the set $(1/2, 1)$, which has cardinality $\\mathfrak{c}$, into the set of solutions $S$. Therefore, $|S| \\ge \\mathfrak{c}$.\n    *   On the other hand, the set $S$ is a subset of the set of all continuous functions from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$, denoted $C(\\mathbb{R})$. A continuous function is uniquely determined by its values on a dense set, like the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$. The number of functions from $\\mathbb{Q}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$ is $|\\mathbb{R}|^{|\\mathbb{Q}|} = \\mathfrak{c}^{\\aleph_0} = (2^{\\aleph_0})^{\\aleph_0} = 2^{\\aleph_0 \\cdot \\aleph_0} = 2^{\\aleph_0} = \\mathfrak{c}$. Thus, the total number of continuous functions is $|C(\\mathbb{R})| = \\mathfrak{c}$.\n    *   Since $S \\subseteq C(\\mathbb{R})$, we must have $|S| \\le \\mathfrak{c}$.\n    *   Combining the two inequalities $|S| \\ge \\mathfrak{c}$ and $|S| \\le \\mathfrak{c}$, the Cantor-Bernstein theorem implies that $|S| = \\mathfrak{c}$.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nThe set of continuous functions $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ satisfying $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$ contains only strictly increasing functions. The number of ways to construct such a function is equal to the number of ways to choose a homeomorphism between two intervals, which is the cardinality of the continuum, $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n\nThe cardinality of the set is $\\mathfrak{c}$."
