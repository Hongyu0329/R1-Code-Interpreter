    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the scansion for the Latin hexameter line: \"verum ubi equi atque hominis casu convenit imago.\"\n\n**1. Understand the Basics of Hexameter**\n*   A line has six feet (`hexameter`).\n*   Each foot can be a **dactyl** (one long syllable followed by two short syllables, pattern: — U U) or a **spondee** (two long syllables, pattern: — —).\n*   Feet 1-4 can be either dactyls or spondees.\n*   Foot 5 is almost always a dactyl.\n*   Foot 6 is a spondee (or a trochee, — U), treated as a spondee for scanning purposes.\n*   **Vowel Length:** Vowels are long either \"by nature\" (e.g., diphthongs like `ae`, certain case endings) or \"by position\" (a vowel followed by two or more consonants, or `x` or `z`). Otherwise, they are short.\n*   **Elision:** A word ending in a vowel (or `-m`) will usually drop that final syllable sound when the next word begins with a vowel (or `h-`).\n\n**2. Line Analysis - Foot by Foot**\n\n**Line:** `verum ubi equi atque hominis casu convenit imago.`\n\n**Foot 1: `verum ubi`**\n*   `verum` ends in `-um` and `ubi` starts with `u-`. This is a clear case for **elision**. The `-um` is dropped.\n*   The line is scanned as `ver' ubi`.\n*   The `ve-` in `verum` contains the vowel `ē`, which is long by nature (`vērus`).\n*   The `u` and `i` in `ubi` are both short.\n*   This gives the syllables `vēr-u-bi`, which scans as **Long-Short-Short (— U U)**.\n*   **Foot 1 is a Dactyl (D).**\n\n**Foot 2: `equi atque`**\n*   This foot is a well-known crux. `equi` is the genitive form of `equus`, so its syllables are `ĕ-quī` (short `e`, long `ī`).\n*   Normally, this would scan as Short-Long (`U —`), which cannot start a foot.\n*   **Exception (Ictus/Caesural Lengthening):** To resolve this, the metrical beat (ictus) on the first syllable of the foot forces the naturally short `e` to be scanned as long. So we treat `equi` as `ēquī`.\n*   The result is two long syllables: **Long-Long (— —)**.\n*   **Foot 2 is a Spondee (S).**\n\n**Foot 3: `atque hominis`**\n*   `atque` ends in `-e` and `hominis` begins with an `h-`, which does not prevent elision. The `-e` is dropped.\n*   The line is scanned as `atqu' hominis`.\n*   The syllable `at-` has a short `a`, but it is followed by two consonants (`t` and `q` from the following syllable), so it is **long by position (—)**.\n*   The `ho-` and `mi-` in `hominis` are both short syllables (`U U`).\n*   The foot is formed from the syllables `at-ho-mi`. This scans as **Long-Short-Short (— U U)**.\n*   **Foot 3 is a Dactyl (D).**\n\n**Foot 4: `nis casu`**\n*   The foot begins with the last syllable of `hominis`, which is `-nis`.\n*   The vowel `i` in `-nis` is short by nature. However, it is followed by two consonants: the `s` at the end of its own syllable and the `c` beginning the next word, `casu`. This makes the syllable `-nis` **long by position (—)**.\n*   The word `casu` is the ablative singular, so both vowels are long by nature (`cāsū`). The first syllable `cā-` is long (`—`).\n*   The foot is formed from the syllables `-nis cā-`, which scans as **Long-Long (— —)**.\n*   **Foot 4 is a Spondee (S).**\n\n**Foot 5: `su convenit i-`**\n*   The foot begins with the last syllable of `casu`, which is `-sū`, a long syllable (`—`).\n*   `convenit` is the perfect tense `convēnit`. We need two short syllables to follow the long `-sū` to form a dactyl. The syllables `con-` and `vē-` are both long. This indicates our foot division is slightly off.\n*   Let's reconsider the last two feet together: `su convenit imago`.\n*   The syllables are `sū(—) con(—) vē(—) nit(U) i(U) mā(—) gō(—)`.\n*   The mandatory dactyl in the fifth foot must be `— U U`. We can see a `U U` pair in `-nit i-`. The preceding syllable `vē-` is long.\n*   Thus, the dactyl is formed by the syllables `vē-nit-i`, which scans as **Long-Short-Short (— U U)**. This is a common pattern where feet do not align with word breaks.\n*   **Foot 5 is a Dactyl (D).**\n\n**Foot 6: `-mago`**\n*   With the previous foot division, the syllables left for the final foot are `-ma-go` from the word `imago`.\n*   The `ā` in `māgo` is long, and the final `ō` is also long.\n*   This scans as **Long-Long (— —)**.\n*   **Foot 6 is a Spondee (S).**\n\n**Summary of the Scan:**\n*   Foot 1: Dactyl (D)\n*   Foot 2: Spondee (S)\n*   Foot 3: Dactyl (D)\n*   Foot 4: Spondee (S)\n*   Foot 5: Dactyl (D)\n*   Foot 6: Spondee (S)\n\nFinal Answer: The scansion is D S D S D S.\n\n<<<D S D S D S>>>"
