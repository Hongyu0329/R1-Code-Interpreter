    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the closest province or territory to the Waskaganish gathering place, outside of Quebec.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Location of Waskaganish**\nThe Waskaganish gathering place is located in the Cree community of Waskaganish. This community is situated in northern Quebec, on the south shore of the Rupert River right where it flows into Rupert Bay, a large bay on the southeastern side of James Bay. Its approximate coordinates are 51.19° N latitude, 78.76° W longitude.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Neighboring Provinces and Territories**\nThe question asks for the closest province or territory *outside* of Quebec. We must identify which provinces and territories are geographically near Waskaganish.\n*   **Ontario:** Borders Quebec to the west. The border runs south from James Bay. The entire western coast of James Bay belongs to Ontario.\n*   **Nunavut:** Borders Quebec to the north. This border runs through the water and includes the islands within James Bay and Hudson Bay.\n*   **Newfoundland and Labrador:** Borders Quebec to the east.\n*   **New Brunswick:** Borders Quebec to the south-east.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Proximity of Each Candidate**\nWe need to compare the distance from Waskaganish to each of these bordering regions.\n*   Waskaganish is located on the eastern coast of James Bay.\n*   Newfoundland and Labrador is far to the east, across the entire Quebec-Labrador peninsula. It is not a close candidate.\n*   New Brunswick is far to the south-east, separated by a large portion of southern Quebec. It is also not a close candidate.\n*   This leaves two primary candidates: **Ontario** and **Nunavut**.\n\n**Step 4: Compare the Distances to Ontario and Nunavut**\n*   **Distance to Ontario:** Waskaganish is on the eastern shore of James Bay. The western shore of James Bay is part of Ontario. The closest point of Ontario is the mainland coastline directly across the southern part of the bay. The straight-line distance across the water from Waskaganish to the Ontario coast (near Hannah Bay) is approximately 75-80 kilometers.\n*   **Distance to Nunavut:** The territory of Nunavut includes the islands in James Bay. The largest and most prominent of these is Akimiski Island. Akimiski Island is located in the middle of James Bay, to the northwest of Waskaganish. The shortest distance from Waskaganish to the coast of Akimiski Island is approximately 130 kilometers.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude the Closest Province or Territory**\nBy comparing the shortest distances, the mainland of Ontario (approx. 75-80 km away) is significantly closer to Waskaganish than the islands of Nunavut (approx. 130 km away).\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n1.  The question specifies \"province or territory,\" so we must consider both.\n2.  The exclusion of \"Quebec\" is critical. We are looking for the nearest non-Quebec location.\n3.  Proximity should be measured as a straight line (as the crow flies), which often involves crossing bodies of water in this region.\n4.  A map of James Bay is essential to visualize the locations. Waskaganish is on the east coast, Ontario is on the west coast, and the islands of Nunavut are in the middle, generally to the north of Waskaganish's latitude.\n\n**Final Answer Acquisition:**\nThe analysis clearly shows that the landmass of the province of Ontario is closer to Waskaganish than the landmass of the territory of Nunavut.\n\n<<<Ontario>>>"
