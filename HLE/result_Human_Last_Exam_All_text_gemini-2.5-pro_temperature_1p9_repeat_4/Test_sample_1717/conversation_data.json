    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Terraria's Expert Mode with an infinite number of players.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Base Health in Expert Mode**\nFirst, we need the starting health value for the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode with a single player. According to the game's source data, the Eye of Cthulhu has a base health of **3,640 HP** in Expert Mode.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Multiplayer Health Scaling Formula**\nIn Expert Mode, the health of bosses increases for each player present in the world. The official formula for this health scaling is as follows:\n\n*Total Health = Base Health × (1 + 0.35 × (Number of Players - 1))*\n\nThis formula signifies that for each player beyond the first, the boss gains an additional 35% of its base health.\n\n**Step 3: Construct the Specific Health Formula for the Eye of Cthulhu**\nWe can now create a specific formula for the Eye of Cthulhu's health, which we will denote as `H(n)`, where `n` is the number of players.\n\n`H(n) = 3640 × (1 + 0.35 × (n - 1))`\n\n**Step 4: Simplify the Health Formula**\nTo analyze the formula's behavior as the number of players (`n`) grows infinitely large, it is helpful to simplify the expression algebraically.\n\n1.  Distribute the `0.35` inside the parenthesis:\n    `H(n) = 3640 × (1 + 0.35n - 0.35)`\n\n2.  Combine the constant terms (`1 - 0.35`):\n    `H(n) = 3640 × (0.65 + 0.35n)`\n\n3.  Distribute the `3640`:\n    `H(n) = (3640 × 0.65) + (3640 × 0.35)n`\n    `H(n) = 2366 + 1274n`\n\n**Step 5: Analyze the Formula for an Infinite Number of Players**\nThe simplified formula, `H(n) = 1274n + 2366`, is a linear function. The question asks for the theoretical maximum health given an infinite number of players, which is a mathematical limit problem. We need to find the limit of `H(n)` as `n` approaches infinity.\n\n`lim (n→∞) (1274n + 2366)`\n\nAs the number of players `n` increases without bound, the term `1274n` also increases without bound. The function grows linearly and does not approach any specific finite value.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Theoretical vs. Practical Limits:** The term \"theoretical maximum\" refers to the value predicted by the game's mathematical rules, not by its software limitations (like the maximum value of the `int` data type, which is 2,147,483,647).\n*   **No Scaling Cap:** The health scaling formula itself does not include any mechanism to cap the health at a certain point. The growth is purely linear.\n*   **Player Limit:** While a real game server has a player limit (e.g., 255), the question explicitly specifies an \"infinite number of players,\" requiring a mathematical limit analysis rather than a calculation with a fixed number.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nBased on the linear nature of the health scaling formula (`H(n) = 1274n + 2366`), the health of the Eye of Cthulhu increases indefinitely as the number of players increases. Therefore, the theoretical maximum health with an infinite number of players is infinite.\n\n<<<Infinity>>>"
