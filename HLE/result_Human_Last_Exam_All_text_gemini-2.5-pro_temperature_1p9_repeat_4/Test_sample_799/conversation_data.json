    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the maximum Hausdorff dimension of a Sidon set in the interval [0, 1].\n\n### Step 1: Define Key Concepts\n\n1.  **Sidon Set:** A subset $A$ of the real numbers $\\mathbb{R}$ is called a Sidon set (or a $B_2$ set) if all pairwise sums of its elements are distinct, up to the order of summands. Formally, for any four elements $a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4 \\in A$, if $a_1 + a_2 = a_3 + a_4$, then it must be that the multiset $\\{a_1, a_2\\}$ is identical to the multiset $\\{a_3, a_4\\}$. This means either $(a_1 = a_3 \\text{ and } a_2 = a_4)$ or $(a_1 = a_4 \\text{ and } a_2 = a_3)$. A key consequence is that a Sidon set cannot contain a non-trivial 3-term arithmetic progression. If $\\{x, x+d, x+2d\\}$ with $d>0$ were in $A$, then we would have $x + (x+2d) = (x+d) + (x+d)$, which violates the Sidon property since $\\{x, x+2d\\} \\ne \\{x+d, x+d\\}$.\n\n2.  **Hausdorff Dimension ($\\dim_H$)**: The Hausdorff dimension is a way to measure the \"fractal\" dimension of a set. It generalizes the notion of dimension to sets that are not smooth manifolds. For our purpose, the crucial properties are that $\\dim_H([0,1]) = 1$ and if $A \\subset B$, then $\\dim_H(A) \\le \\dim_H(B)$.\n\n### Step 2: Establish an Upper Bound\n\nThe problem asks for the *maximum* possible Hausdorff dimension for a Sidon set. We can first find an upper bound on this value.\n\n1.  **Connection to Arithmetic Progressions:** There is a deep result in fractal geometry and additive combinatorics that relates the Hausdorff dimension of a set to the arithmetic structures it contains. A theorem, first established by K. Keleti (and later refined by others like I. Łaba and M. Pramanik), states that any compact set in $\\mathbb{R}$ with a Hausdorff dimension strictly greater than $1/2$ must contain a 3-term arithmetic progression.\n\n2.  **Violation of the Sidon Property:** As established in Step 1, any set containing a non-trivial 3-term arithmetic progression (a set of the form $\\{x, x+d, x+2d\\}$ with $d>0$) cannot be a Sidon set. The sum $x + (x+2d)$ is equal to $(x+d)+(x+d)$, violating the required uniqueness of sums.\n\n3.  **Conclusion for the Upper Bound:** Combining these two points, if a set $A \\subset [0,1]$ has a Hausdorff dimension $\\dim_H(A) > 1/2$, it must contain a 3-term arithmetic progression, and therefore it cannot be a Sidon set. This implies that any Sidon set $A$ in $[0,1]$ must satisfy $\\dim_H(A) \\le 1/2$. This establishes $1/2$ as an upper bound for the possible dimension.\n\n### Step 3: Establish a Lower Bound (Existence of High-Dimension Sidon Sets)\n\nNow we need to show that this upper bound of $1/2$ is sharp. We can do this by demonstrating the existence of Sidon sets with Hausdorff dimensions that are arbitrarily close to, or equal to, $1/2$. This is typically done via a construction of a fractal set, like a generalized Cantor set.\n\n1.  **Cantor Set Construction:** Consider constructing a set of real numbers in $[0,1]$ using a base-$b$ representation where the digits are restricted to a specific set $D \\subset \\{0, 1, ..., b-1\\}$. The resulting set is $C(b,D) = \\{ \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty d_k b^{-k} \\mid d_k \\in D \\}$. The Hausdorff dimension of such a set is $\\dim_H(C(b,D)) = \\frac{\\log(|D|)}{\\log(b)}$.\n\n2.  **Ensuring the Sidon Property:** For $C(b,D)$ to be a Sidon set, two conditions must be met:\n    *   The digit set $D$ itself must be a Sidon set within the integers.\n    *   The base $b$ must be large enough relative to the digits in $D$ so that when we add two numbers from $C(b,D)$, no \"carries\" occur in the base-$b$ addition. A sufficient condition is that for any two digits $d_i, d_j \\in D$, their sum is less than the base: $d_i + d_j < b$. If we let $d_{max} = \\max(D)$, this condition is satisfied if $2d_{max} < b$.\n    If these conditions hold, the sum of two numbers from $C(b,D)$ corresponds, digit by digit, to the sum of digits from $D$. The Sidon property of $C(b,D)$ is then directly inherited from the Sidon property of the digit set $D$.\n\n3.  **Finding Dense Sidon Sets of Integers:** From number theory, it is known that it is possible to construct large Sidon sets. For a large integer $M$, there exist Sidon sets $D \\subset \\{0, 1, ..., M\\}$ whose size $|D|$ is approximately $\\sqrt{M}$. More precisely, $|D| = (1-o(1))\\sqrt{M}$.\n\n4.  **Constructing Sidon Sets with Dimension Approaching 1/2:** We can combine these ideas.\n    *   Choose a large integer $M$.\n    *   Find a Sidon set $D \\subset \\{0, 1, ..., M\\}$ with $|D| \\approx \\sqrt{M}$.\n    *   Choose a base $b$ large enough to prevent carries. Let's pick $b = 2M+1$.\n    *   Construct the set $A = C(b,D)$. By our reasoning, $A$ is a Sidon set.\n    *   The Hausdorff dimension of this set is:\n        $\\dim_H(A) = \\frac{\\log(|D|)}{\\log(b)} \\approx \\frac{\\log(\\sqrt{M})}{\\log(2M+1)} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}\\log(M)}{\\log(2M+1)}$\n    *   As we let $M$ go to infinity, this value approaches:\n        $\\lim_{M \\to \\infty} \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}\\log(M)}{\\log(2M+1)} = \\lim_{M \\to \\infty} \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}\\log(M)}{\\log(M) + \\log(2+1/M)} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n    This shows we can construct Sidon sets with Hausdorff dimensions arbitrarily close to $1/2$. Therefore, the supremum of the possible dimensions must be at least $1/2$.\n\n5.  **Achieving the Bound:** In fact, more advanced constructions by mathematicians like J.-P. Kahane have shown that it is possible to construct a Sidon set that has a Hausdorff dimension of *exactly* $1/2$.\n\n### Step 4: Final Conclusion\n\nFrom Step 2, we know that the Hausdorff dimension of any Sidon set must be less than or equal to $1/2$. From Step 3, we know that there exist Sidon sets with dimensions arbitrarily close to $1/2$, and even one with a dimension of exactly $1/2$.\n\nCombining these two results, the maximum possible Hausdorff dimension of a Sidon set in the reals between 0 and 1 is exactly $1/2$.\n\n<<<0.5>>>"
