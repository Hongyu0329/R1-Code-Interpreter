    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the determinant of the given matrix.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Question**\nThe core task is to compute the determinant of the given 3x3 matrix:\n\\[\nA = \\begin{bmatrix}\n2 & -1 & -1 \\\\\n-1 & 2 & -1 \\\\\n-1 & -1 & 2\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nThe information about \"the adjacency matrix of the Markov quiver for \\( m_{1/2} = 13 \\)\" is contextual. Since the matrix `A` is explicitly provided, we do not need to derive it from the context. Our calculation focuses solely on the matrix `A`.\n\n**2. List Careful Points**\n*   **Focus on the given matrix:** The explicit definition of matrix A is the starting point. The contextual information about Markov quivers should not distract from the primary calculation.\n*   **Method Selection:** For a 3x3 matrix, the determinant can be calculated using several methods, including cofactor expansion or Sarrus's rule. Another powerful method is to use matrix properties, if applicable.\n*   **Sign Convention:** When using cofactor expansion, it's crucial to be careful with the signs `+`, `-`, `+` for the elements of the first row. The general formula is:\n    $\\det(A) = a_{11} C_{11} + a_{12} C_{12} + a_{13} C_{13}$, where $C_{ij}$ are the cofactors.\n*   **Arithmetic Precision:** Double-check all multiplications and additions/subtractions, especially with negative numbers.\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation\n\nWe can compute the determinant in two ways.\n\n**Method 1: Cofactor Expansion**\n\nThe determinant of a 3x3 matrix $\\begin{bmatrix} a & b & c \\\\ d & e & f \\\\ g & h & i \\end{bmatrix}$ is given by the formula:\n$\\det(A) = a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg)$\n\nFor our matrix A:\n*   a = 2, b = -1, c = -1\n*   d = -1, e = 2, f = -1\n*   g = -1, h = -1, i = 2\n\nLet's substitute these values into the formula:\n$\\det(A) = 2 \\times \\det \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix} - (-1) \\times \\det \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix} + (-1) \\times \\det \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 2 \\\\ -1 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nNow, we calculate each part:\n1.  **First term:**\n    $2 \\times ((2)(2) - (-1)(-1)) = 2 \\times (4 - 1) = 2 \\times 3 = 6$\n2.  **Second term:**\n    $-(-1) \\times ((-1)(2) - (-1)(-1)) = 1 \\times (-2 - 1) = 1 \\times (-3) = -3$\n3.  **Third term:**\n    $(-1) \\times ((-1)(-1) - (2)(-1)) = -1 \\times (1 - (-2)) = -1 \\times (1 + 2) = -1 \\times 3 = -3$\n\nFinally, we sum the three parts:\n$\\det(A) = 6 - 3 - 3 = 0$\n\n**Method 2: Using Matrix Properties (A Quicker Approach)**\n\nA key property of determinants is that if the rows or columns of a matrix are linearly dependent, its determinant is zero. A simple way to check for a specific type of linear dependence is to sum the elements in each row or column.\n\nLet's sum the elements of each row of matrix A:\n*   **Row 1:** 2 + (-1) + (-1) = 0\n*   **Row 2:** (-1) + 2 + (-1) = 0\n*   **Row 3:** (-1) + (-1) + 2 = 0\n\nSince the sum of the elements in every row is 0, this implies that the vector $\\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}$ is a non-zero vector in the null space of the matrix, because:\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n2 & -1 & -1 \\\\\n-1 & 2 & -1 \\\\\n-1 & -1 & 2\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 \\\\\n1 \\\\\n1\n\\end{bmatrix} =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n2(1) - 1(1) - 1(1) \\\\\n-1(1) + 2(1) - 1(1) \\\\\n-1(1) - 1(1) + 2(1)\n\\end{bmatrix} =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n0 \\\\\n0 \\\\\n0\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nA matrix that has a non-zero vector in its null space is called a singular (or degenerate) matrix. A fundamental property of singular matrices is that their determinant is always 0.\nThis confirms the result from our direct calculation. The matrix A is, in fact, the Laplacian matrix for the complete graph on 3 vertices ($K_3$), whose determinant is always zero.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe determinant of the given matrix is 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
