    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the value of a(10).\n\n**1. Understanding the Definition**\n\n*   **Manhattan Lattice:** A 2D grid where movement is restricted to horizontal and vertical steps (Up, Down, Left, Right). It is also known as a square lattice.\n*   **Self-Avoiding Walk (SAW):** A path on the lattice starting from a defined origin (e.g., (0,0)) that does not visit the same point (lattice site) more than once.\n*   **n-step walk:** The path is composed of exactly 'n' steps.\n*   **a(n):** The function a(n) represents the total count of distinct n-step self-avoiding walks.\n\n**2. Step-by-Step Calculation for Small 'n'**\n\nTo understand the problem's complexity, let's compute the first few terms of the sequence a(n).\n\n*   **a(1):**\n    *   Starting at the origin, we have 4 possible first steps: Up, Down, Left, or Right.\n    *   All these are distinct and self-avoiding.\n    *   Therefore, **a(1) = 4**.\n\n*   **a(2):**\n    *   For each of the 4 one-step walks, we can take a second step. The only restriction is that we cannot immediately reverse direction (as that would revisit the origin).\n    *   For example, if the first step was Right to (1,0), the second step can be Right, Up, or Down, but not Left.\n    *   So, there are 3 choices for the second step for each of the 4 initial paths.\n    *   a(2) = 4 * 3 = **12**. All 12 of these are self-avoiding.\n\n*   **a(3):**\n    *   For each of the 12 two-step walks, we again have 3 choices for the third step if we only consider avoiding immediate reversal.\n    *   Is it possible for a 3-step walk to self-intersect otherwise? No. The earliest a path can revisit a non-adjacent previous point is in 4 steps (e.g., forming a square).\n    *   Therefore, a(3) = 12 * 3 = **36**.\n\n*   **a(4):**\n    *   Here, the problem becomes more complex. Let's start with the total number of walks that don't immediately reverse, which is a(3) * 3 = 36 * 3 = 108.\n    *   However, some of these 4-step walks will now violate the self-avoiding condition by returning to the origin. This happens when the walk forms a 1x1 square.\n    *   Let's count how many such walks exist. A path that forms a square must involve two perpendicular directions (e.g., Right and Up).\n    *   The path must look like: Right -> Up -> Left -> Down.\n    *   Starting choice: 4 directions (e.g., Right).\n    *   Second choice (must be a turn): 2 directions (Up or Down).\n    *   The third and fourth steps are then forced to complete the square back to the origin.\n    *   So, the number of 4-step walks that are invalid (form a closed square) is 4 * 2 = 8.\n    *   Therefore, a(4) = (Total non-reversing walks) - (Invalid walks) = 108 - 8 = **100**.\n\n**3. Careful Points and Increasing Complexity**\n\n*   **Combinatorial Explosion:** As 'n' increases, the manual method of \"total paths minus invalid paths\" becomes extremely difficult. The number of ways a path can intersect itself grows rapidly. For example, a 6-step walk can form a 2x1 rectangle, and so on.\n*   **No Closed-Form Formula:** There is no known simple formula to calculate a(n) for any given 'n'.\n*   **Computational Problem:** Calculating a(n) for larger 'n' is a classic and challenging problem in computational physics and combinatorics. The values are typically found using sophisticated computer algorithms (like recursive backtracking or Monte Carlo methods).\n\n**4. Acquiring the Final Answer for a(10)**\n\nGiven the infeasibility of manual calculation, the value of a(10) is found by referring to the established, pre-computed results for this well-known sequence. This sequence is cataloged in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) as A001411.\n\nThe known values for the sequence are:\n*   a(1) = 4\n*   a(2) = 12\n*   a(3) = 36\n*   a(4) = 100\n*   a(5) = 284\n*   a(6) = 780\n*   a(7) = 2172\n*   a(8) = 5916\n*   a(9) = 16268\n*   **a(10) = 44100**\n\nBased on these extensively verified computational results, the number of 10-step self-avoiding walks on a Manhattan lattice is 44,100.\n\n<<<44100>>>"
