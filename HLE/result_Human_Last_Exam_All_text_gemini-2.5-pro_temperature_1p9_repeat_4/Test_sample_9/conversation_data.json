    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to compute $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z})$, the first homology group with integer coefficients for the moduli space $X$ of nondegenerate lattices in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ with unit area.\n\n**Step 1: Define the moduli space X**\n\n*   **Lattice:** A lattice $L$ in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ is a discrete subgroup of rank 2. It can be specified by a basis, i.e., two linearly independent vectors $\\{v_1, v_2\\}$. The lattice is the set $L = \\{m v_1 + n v_2 \\mid m, n \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}$. A lattice can be represented by a matrix $A = [v_1 | v_2] \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{R})$, where $L = A(\\mathbb{Z}^2)$.\n*   **Nondegenerate:** This is implied by the definition of a lattice in $\\mathbb{R}^2$, meaning it spans the whole plane.\n*   **Unit Area:** The area of the fundamental parallelogram of the lattice is given by $|\\det(A)|$. We are given that this area is 1, so $|\\det(A)| = 1$. Let's denote the set of these matrices as $SL^\\pm(2, \\mathbb{R}) = \\{ A \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{R}) \\mid \\det(A) = \\pm 1 \\}$.\n*   **Moduli Space:** The term \"moduli space\" implies we are identifying lattices that are equivalent under some geometric transformation. For lattices, the natural equivalence is isometry of the ambient space $\\mathbb{R}^2$. Any isometry of $\\mathbb{R}^2$ that preserves the lattice structure (i.e., maps 0 to 0) is an orthogonal transformation. Thus, two lattices $L_1$ and $L_2$ are considered the same point in the moduli space $X$ if there exists an orthogonal transformation $R \\in O(2)$ such that $L_2 = R(L_1)$.\n\n**Step 2: Find a convenient representation of the space X**\n\nA lattice's geometric properties (lengths of vectors, angles between them) are captured by its **Gram matrix**. For a basis $\\{v_1, v_2\\}$, the Gram matrix is $G$ with entries $G_{ij} = v_i \\cdot v_j$. If $A = [v_1 | v_2]$ is the basis matrix, then $G = A^T A$.\n\n*   The determinant of the Gram matrix is $\\det(G) = \\det(A^T A) = (\\det A)^2 = (\\text{Area})^2$. Since the area is 1, we must have $\\det(G)=1$.\n*   A Gram matrix is always symmetric and positive-definite.\n*   If we apply an orthogonal transformation $R \\in O(2)$ to the lattice, the new basis is $R A$. The new Gram matrix is $(RA)^T (RA) = A^T R^T R A = A^T I A = A^T A = G$. So, the Gram matrix is invariant under isometries. This means that each point in our moduli space $X$ corresponds to a unique Gram matrix.\n\nHowever, a single lattice has many different bases. If $A$ is a basis matrix for $L$, then any other basis matrix is of the form $A' = Ag$ for some $g \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ (the group of integer matrices with determinant $\\pm 1$). The Gram matrix for the new basis is $G' = (Ag)^T (Ag) = g^T G g$.\n\nTherefore, the moduli space $X$ is the space of all possible Gram matrices modulo this change-of-basis equivalence.\nLet $P_2$ be the space of $2 \\times 2$ symmetric, positive-definite matrices with determinant 1.\nThen $X$ is the quotient space $X = P_2 / GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$, where the action is $G \\mapsto g^T G g$.\n\n**Step 3: Relate X to a more familiar space**\n\nThe space $P_2$ is a well-known model for the hyperbolic plane $\\mathbb{H}^2$. There is a diffeomorphism between $P_2$ and $\\mathbb{H}^2$. Furthermore, the action of $GL(2, \\mathbb{R})$ on $P_2$ by $G \\mapsto g^T G g$ is conjugate to the standard isometric action of $PGL(2, \\mathbb{R}) = GL(2, \\mathbb{R})/\\{\\pm I\\}$ on $\\mathbb{H}^2$.\nThis means that our moduli space $X$ is isomorphic to the quotient of the hyperbolic plane by the action of the modular group $PGL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n$X \\cong \\mathbb{H}^2 / PGL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the topology of the quotient space**\n\nTo understand the topology of $X$, we can analyze the group action. $PGL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ is composed of two parts:\n1.  The orientation-preserving isometries, which form the group $PSL(2, \\mathbb{Z}) = SL(2, \\mathbb{Z}) / \\{\\pm I\\}$.\n2.  The orientation-reversing isometries. $PGL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ can be written as a semi-direct product $PSL(2, \\mathbb{Z}) \\rtimes C_2$, where $C_2$ is generated by an orientation-reversing isometry, for instance, $\\tau \\mapsto -\\bar{\\tau}$.\n\nLet's first consider the quotient by the orientation-preserving part, $M = \\mathbb{H}^2 / PSL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$. This is the famous modular surface. There is a classical result in complex analysis that the $j$-invariant gives a biholomorphic map from $M$ to the complex plane $\\mathbb{C}$. So, $M$ is topologically a plane, $M \\cong \\mathbb{R}^2$.\n\nNow, we must take the quotient of $M$ by the remaining $C_2$ action.\n$X = M / C_2$.\nThe action $\\tau \\mapsto -\\bar{\\tau}$ on $\\mathbb{H}^2$ induces an action on $M \\cong \\mathbb{C}$. The q-expansion of the j-function $j(\\tau)$ has real coefficients, which implies that $j(-\\bar{\\tau}) = \\overline{j(\\tau)}$. Thus, the action on $\\mathbb{C}$ is complex conjugation: $z \\mapsto \\bar{z}$.\n\nSo, our space is $X \\cong \\mathbb{C} / (z \\sim \\bar{z})$.\nA point $z = x+iy$ is identified with its conjugate $\\bar{z}=x-iy$. We can take the closed upper half-plane, $\\{(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 \\mid y \\ge 0\\}$, as a fundamental domain for this action. The boundary (the real axis, where $y=0$) consists of the fixed points. The quotient space is homeomorphic to this closed upper half-plane.\n\n**Step 5: Compute the homology group**\n\nThe space $X$ is homeomorphic to the closed upper half-plane, which we can denote by $\\mathbb{H}_{\\ge 0}$.\nThis space is contractible. A homotopy that contracts the entire space to the point $(0,1)$ (which represents $i \\in \\mathbb{C}$) is given by $F_t(x,y) = (1-t)(x,y) + t(0,1) = ((1-t)x, (1-t)y+t)$ for $t \\in [0,1]$. For any point $(x,y)$ with $y \\ge 0$, the path lies entirely within $\\mathbb{H}_{\\ge 0}$.\nA contractible space has the same homotopy type as a point.\n\nThe first homology group, $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z})$, is the abelianization of the fundamental group, $\\pi_1(X)$.\nSince $X$ is contractible, its fundamental group is trivial: $\\pi_1(X) = \\{e\\}$.\nThe abelianization of the trivial group is the trivial group itself.\nTherefore, $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$.\n\nFinal careful points check:\n*   The definition of the moduli space includes identification by all isometries ($O(2)$), not just rotations ($SO(2)$). This leads to the quotient by $PGL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ instead of just $PSL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n*   The space $X$ is an orbifold, but the question asks for the singular homology of the underlying topological space. This space is homeomorphic to the closed upper-half plane, a contractible manifold-with-boundary.\n*   The steps from the geometric definition of the space to its topological characterization as a contractible space are all standard results in the theory of modular forms and hyperbolic geometry.\n\nThe result is that the first homology group is trivial."
