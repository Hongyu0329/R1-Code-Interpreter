    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of nonzero coefficients of order 10 in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) expansion.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) Expansion**\n\nThe BCH formula provides an expression for $Z = \\log(e^X e^Y)$, where $X$ and $Y$ are non-commuting variables (elements of a Lie algebra). The formula expands $Z$ as an infinite series of nested commutators of $X$ and $Y$.\n\n$Z(X,Y) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} Z_n(X,Y)$\n\nEach term $Z_n(X,Y)$ is a homogeneous polynomial of degree $n$ in $X$ and $Y$. For example:\n*   $Z_1(X,Y) = X+Y$\n*   $Z_2(X,Y) = \\frac{1}{2}[X,Y]$\n*   $Z_3(X,Y) = \\frac{1}{12}[X,[X,Y]] + \\frac{1}{12}[Y,[Y,X]]$\n\nThe question asks for the number of non-zero coefficients in the term $Z_{10}(X,Y)$.\n\n**2. Relate the Problem to Free Lie Algebras**\n\nThe terms $Z_n(X,Y)$ are elements of the free Lie algebra generated by two elements, $X$ and $Y$. Let's denote this algebra as $\\mathcal{L}(X,Y)$. This algebra is graded by degree, so $\\mathcal{L}(X,Y) = \\bigoplus_{n=1}^\\infty L_n(X,Y)$, where $L_n(X,Y)$ is the vector space spanned by all linearly independent commutators of total degree $n$.\n\nTo speak of \"coefficients,\" we must express $Z_{10}(X,Y)$ as a linear combination of basis elements of the vector space $L_{10}(X,Y)$.\n\n$Z_{10}(X,Y) = \\sum_{i=1}^{m} c_i b_i$\n\nwhere $\\{b_1, \\dots, b_m\\}$ is a basis for $L_{10}(X,Y)$, and $c_i$ are the coefficients.\n\n**3. Key point: Interpretation of \"Number of Nonzero Coefficients\"**\n\nThe number of nonzero coefficients could, in principle, depend on the choice of basis. However, the question is understood in the standard context of Lie theory to refer to a \"natural\" or \"standard\" basis, such as a Hall basis or a Lyndon basis. For these standard bases, it is a known (and non-trivial) mathematical fact that all coefficients $c_i$ in the BCH expansion are non-zero.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to finding the number of elements in a basis for $L_{10}(X,Y)$. This is simply the dimension of the vector space $L_{10}(X,Y)$.\n\n**4. Using Witt's Formula to Find the Dimension**\n\nThe dimension of the $n$-th graded component of the free Lie algebra on $k$ generators is given by Witt's formula:\n\n$\\dim(L_n(k)) = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{d|n} \\mu(d) k^{n/d}$\n\nwhere:\n*   $n$ is the degree (or order), which is 10 in our case.\n*   $k$ is the number of generators, which is 2 (for $X$ and $Y$).\n*   The sum is over all positive divisors $d$ of $n$.\n*   $\\mu(d)$ is the Möbius function.\n\n**5. Calculation**\n\nLet's apply Witt's formula for $n=10$ and $k=2$.\n\n*   **Divisors of n=10:** The divisors are $d = 1, 2, 5, 10$.\n*   **Möbius function values, $\\mu(d)$:**\n    *   $\\mu(1) = 1$\n    *   $\\mu(2) = -1$ (2 is a product of 1 distinct prime)\n    *   $\\mu(5) = -1$ (5 is a product of 1 distinct prime)\n    *   $\\mu(10) = \\mu(2 \\cdot 5) = (-1)^2 = 1$ (10 is a product of 2 distinct primes)\n\n*   **Substitute these values into Witt's formula:**\n    $\\dim(L_{10}(2)) = \\frac{1}{10} \\left[ \\mu(1)2^{10/1} + \\mu(2)2^{10/2} + \\mu(5)2^{10/5} + \\mu(10)2^{10/10} \\right]$\n\n*   **Perform the calculation:**\n    $\\dim(L_{10}(2)) = \\frac{1}{10} \\left[ (1) \\cdot 2^{10} + (-1) \\cdot 2^{5} + (-1) \\cdot 2^{2} + (1) \\cdot 2^{1} \\right]$\n    $\\dim(L_{10}(2)) = \\frac{1}{10} \\left[ 1024 - 32 - 4 + 2 \\right]$\n    $\\dim(L_{10}(2)) = \\frac{1}{10} \\left[ 992 - 4 + 2 \\right]$\n    $\\dim(L_{10}(2)) = \\frac{1}{10} \\left[ 988 + 2 \\right]$\n    $\\dim(L_{10}(2)) = \\frac{1}{10} \\left[ 990 \\right]$\n    $\\dim(L_{10}(2)) = 99$\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe dimension of the space of order 10 terms in the BCH expansion is 99. As all coefficients corresponding to a standard basis are non-zero, the number of non-zero coefficients is 99.\n\n<<<99>>>"
