The final state is given by the expression:
$|\Psi_{final}\rangle = \frac{1}{5} \sum_{i=0}^{4} \sum_{j=0}^{4} |i\rangle_A \otimes |j\rangle_B$
This can also be written as the tensor product $|\psi\rangle_A \otimes |\psi\rangle_B$, where $|\psi\rangle$ is the uniform superposition state defined in the problem.
