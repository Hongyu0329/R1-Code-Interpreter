    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe core of the question asks to identify a specific Christian theologian who meets several criteria:\n1.  **Is a Christian theologian:** The figure must be from within the Christian intellectual tradition.\n2.  **Developed specialized terminology:** We are not looking for a general discussion, but for specific terms or a conceptual framework.\n3.  **The terminology describes changes in the laws of nature:** The concepts must explain how the regular, predictable patterns of the natural world can be suspended, altered, or overridden.\n4.  **The terminology is applicable to two specific cases:**\n    *   The virgin birth of Jesus (a singular, miraculous event).\n    *   Possible alterations in natural laws at the Fall (a systemic, historical change in the state of creation).\n5.  **Who was the *first* to do this?:** This points towards an early and foundational figure, likely a Church Father, who laid the groundwork for later thought.\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate Potential Candidates**\n\n*   **Early Church Fathers (before Augustine):** Figures like Irenaeus and Origen discussed miracles and the Fall, but they generally did not develop a systematic, philosophical vocabulary to explain the mechanics of *how* natural laws were affected. Their focus was more on affirming the scriptural accounts.\n*   **Thomas Aquinas (13th Century):** Aquinas developed the highly influential framework of **Primary and Secondary Causality**. God is the Primary Cause who typically works through secondary causes (the laws of nature). A miracle occurs when God, the Primary Cause, acts directly, bypassing secondary causes. This framework can explain both the virgin birth (God's direct action) and the effects of the Fall (a change in the state and relations of secondary causes). However, Aquinas built upon an existing foundation and may not be the *first*.\n*   **Protestant Reformers (16th Century):** Theologians like John Calvin wrote extensively on God's sovereignty and providence but did not primarily focus on creating new metaphysical terminology for how miracles alter nature's laws. They largely worked within the Augustinian tradition they inherited.\n*   **Augustine of Hippo (4th-5th Century):** Augustine wrote extensively on creation, miracles, and the consequences of the Fall. He was one of the first to approach these topics with rigorous philosophical and theological detail. He developed a specific conceptual vocabulary to handle these problems.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Augustine's Terminology and its Application**\n\nAugustine of Hippo is the most fitting answer. He was the first to develop a coherent and influential framework with specialized language to address these issues.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Specialized Terminology**\n    Augustine did not see miracles as violations of nature in an absolute sense, because nature itself is whatever God wills it to be. Instead, he drew a distinction between what is normal and what is exceptional. His specialized terms for this are:\n    *   ***ordo naturalis*** or ***consuetudo naturae***: The \"natural order\" or the \"custom of nature.\" This refers to the regular, predictable way the world works according to the laws God established and which we observe.\n    *   ***contra cursum naturae***: \"Against the course of nature.\" This describes a miracle. It is an event that is contrary to our *experience* of the natural order, but not contrary to God's higher will or power. For Augustine, a miracle is not God breaking His own rules, but rather acting in a way that is outside the usual chain of cause and effect that He established for the world.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Application to the Virgin Birth**\n    The virgin birth is a textbook example of an event that is *contra cursum naturae*. The \"custom of nature\" (*consuetudo naturae*) dictates that human conception requires both a male and a female. Augustine explains that in the virgin birth, God acted directly and exceptionally, producing an effect without its usual natural cause to show His power over the nature He created.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Application to Alterations at the Fall**\n    Augustine's framework also applies to the systemic changes resulting from the Fall. He taught that the original created order existed in a state of perfection, sustained by God's grace. Human beings, for example, were created mortal by nature but were sustained in a state of immortality by a gift of grace (a \"higher law\" in operation).\n    *   The Fall represented a change in the *ordo naturalis*. God withdrew certain sustaining graces, and creation was subjected to \"futility\" (Romans 8).\n    *   The \"laws\" of death, decay, and corruption were not new creations but were the natural consequences for a material world no longer upheld by that special grace. The *operative* laws of nature changed from a pre-lapsarian (pre-Fall) to a post-lapsarian (post-Fall) state. Augustineâ€™s framework could thus account for this massive shift in how the natural order functions.\n\n*   **Careful Point 4: Augustine's Priority**\n    Living and writing centuries before the Scholastics like Aquinas, Augustine was the foundational Western theologian who first formulated this type of detailed analysis. His work on miracles in *The City of God* and his commentaries on Genesis established the terminology and concepts that would dominate Western theological thought for over a thousand years.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nAugustine of Hippo was the first major Christian theologian to develop a specialized conceptual framework and terminology (*ordo naturalis* vs. *contra cursum naturae*) that could systematically describe both singular miraculous events like the virgin birth and systemic shifts in the laws of nature, such as those believed to have occurred at the Fall.\n\n<<<Augustine of Hippo>>>"
