    "An elegant step-by-step analysis to solve the problem is as follows:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the system and the question**\nThe system of differential equations is:\n$$d'(t)=2d^2(t)+(-3u(t)+5u^2(t))d(t)-u^3(t)(1-u(t))$$\n$$u'(t)=u^2(t)(u(t)-1)$$\nWe are asked to find the separatrix of this system in the phase plane $(u, d)$ for $u \\geq 0$. A separatrix is a curve in the phase plane that separates regions of different qualitative long-term behavior of the trajectories. Separatrices are often the stable or unstable manifolds of saddle points.\n\n**Step 2: Find the equilibrium points**\nEquilibrium points occur when $d'(t)=0$ and $u'(t)=0$.\nFrom $u'(t) = u^2(u-1) = 0$, we get $u=0$ or $u=1$.\n\nCase 1: $u=0$\nSubstitute $u=0$ into the equation for $d'(t)$:\n$d' = 2d^2 + (0)d - 0 = 0 \\implies 2d^2=0 \\implies d=0$.\nSo, $(0,0)$ is an equilibrium point.\n\nCase 2: $u=1$\nSubstitute $u=1$ into the equation for $d'(t)$:\n$d' = 2d^2 + (-3+5)d - 1^3(1-1) = 0 \\implies 2d^2+2d=0 \\implies 2d(d+1)=0$.\nThis gives $d=0$ or $d=-1$.\nSo, $(1,0)$ and $(1,-1)$ are two more equilibrium points.\n\nThe equilibrium points in the region $u \\geq 0$ are $(0,0)$, $(1,0)$, and $(1,-1)$.\n\n**Step 3: Classify the equilibrium points**\nWe compute the Jacobian matrix of the system. Let $f(u,d) = u^3-u^2$ and $g(u,d) = 2d^2 + (5u^2-3u)d + u^4-u^3$.\n$$J(u,d) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial u} & \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial d} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial u} & \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial d} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 3u^2-2u & 0 \\\\ (10u-3)d + 4u^3-3u^2 & 4d+5u^2-3u \\end{pmatrix}$$\n\nAt $(1,-1)$:\n$$J(1,-1) = \\begin{pmatrix} 3(1)^2-2(1) & 0 \\\\ (10-3)(-1)+4-3 & 4(-1)+5-3 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ -6 & -2 \\end{pmatrix}$$\nThe eigenvalues are the diagonal entries, $\\lambda_1 = 1$ and $\\lambda_2 = -2$. Since the eigenvalues have opposite signs, the point $(1,-1)$ is a saddle point. Saddle points are crucial for finding separatrices.\n\nAt $(1,0)$:\n$$J(1,0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 4-3 & 5-3 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}$$\nThe eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1 = 1$ and $\\lambda_2 = 2$. Both are positive, so $(1,0)$ is an unstable node (a source).\n\nAt $(0,0)$:\n$$J(0,0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$$\nThis is a degenerate case where linearization is inconclusive.\n\n**Step 4: Look for an invariant manifold**\nThe separatrices are the stable and unstable manifolds of the saddle point $(1, -1)$. Instead of solving the full ODE for the trajectories, we can test for a simple invariant algebraic curve. Let's test a simple polynomial relationship between $d$ and $u$, of the form $d=ku^n$. Let's try $d=-u^2$.\nIf $d(t) = -u(t)^2$, then by the chain rule, $d'(t) = -2u(t) u'(t)$.\nWe can substitute the expression for $u'(t)$ from the second DE:\n$d'(t) = -2u(t) [u^2(t)(u(t)-1)] = -2u^4(t) + 2u^3(t)$.\n\nNow, let's substitute $d=-u^2$ into the first DE:\n$d'(t) = 2(-u^2)^2 + (-3u+5u^2)(-u^2) - u^3(1-u)$\n$d'(t) = 2u^4 - (-3u^3+5u^4) - (u^3-u^4)$\n$d'(t) = 2u^4 + 3u^3 - 5u^4 - u^3 + u^4$\n$d'(t) = (2-5+1)u^4 + (3-1)u^3 = -2u^4 + 2u^3$.\n\nThe two expressions for $d'(t)$ are identical. This means that any trajectory that starts on the curve $d=-u^2$ will stay on this curve for all time. Thus, $d=-u^2$ is an invariant manifold of the system.\n\n**Step 5: Identify the separatrix**\nThis invariant curve $d=-u^2$ passes through the saddle point $(1,-1)$ since $-1 = -(1)^2$. An invariant curve passing through a saddle point must be part of its stable or unstable manifold. To determine which one, we check the tangent of the curve at $(1,-1)$.\nThe slope of the curve $d=-u^2$ is $\\frac{dd}{du} = -2u$. At $u=1$, the slope is $-2$.\nThe eigenvectors of the Jacobian at $(1,-1)$ determine the directions of the stable and unstable manifolds.\nFor $\\lambda_1 = 1$ (unstable), the eigenvector $v_1$ is found by solving $(J-I)v_1=0$:\n$\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ -6 & -3 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} v_{1u} \\\\ v_{1d} \\end{pmatrix} = 0 \\implies -6v_{1u}-3v_{1d}=0 \\implies v_{1d}=-2v_{1u}$.\nSo, $v_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -2 \\end{pmatrix}$. The slope of the unstable manifold at $(1,-1)$ is $-2/1 = -2$.\n\nSince the slope of the curve $d=-u^2$ at $(1,-1)$ matches the direction of the unstable manifold, the curve $d=-u^2$ is the unstable manifold of the saddle point $(1,-1)$. The unstable manifold of a saddle point is a separatrix. It separates trajectories with different long-term behaviors. In the region $u>1$, it separates trajectories whose $d$ coordinate goes to $+\\infty$ from those whose $d$ coordinate goes to $-\\infty$. This curve also connects the saddle point $(1,-1)$ to the equilibrium point $(0,0)$, forming a heteroclinic orbit. This curve plays a central role in the overall dynamics."
