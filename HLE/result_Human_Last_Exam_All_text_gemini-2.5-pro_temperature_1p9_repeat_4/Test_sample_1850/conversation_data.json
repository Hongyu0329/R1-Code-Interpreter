    "This is a question that requires a careful analysis of the text of John Milton's *Paradise Lost* and a clear definition of the term \"historical saint.\"\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n### Step 1: Defining \"Historical Saint\"\nFor the purposes of this question, we will define a \"historical saint\" as a human being who is believed to have actually lived and who is regarded as a holy person or \"saint\" within major Christian traditions.\n\n*   **\"Historical\"**: This excludes celestial beings who did not live a human life on Earth, such as the archangels (Michael, Gabriel, Raphael, Uriel). It also excludes purely mythological or pagan figures mentioned in the epic.\n*   **\"Saint\"**: This term is interpreted broadly to mean a righteous or holy figure from the Old or New Testament. This includes figures revered as saints in Catholic, Orthodox, or Protestant traditions. Milton, as a Puritan, would have considered all true believers \"saints,\" so this broad definition is appropriate. This criterion excludes antagonistic figures like Cain or Nimrod. It also differentiates saints from divine figures; therefore, Jesus (the Son of God) is not counted as a \"saint\" in this context, but as a member of the Godhead.\n\n### Step 2: Systematically Searching *Paradise Lost* for Named Saints\nThe most fruitful parts of the epic for finding such names are Books XI and XII, where the Archangel Michael reveals the future of mankind to Adam. However, the entire text must be considered. The key constraint is that the saint must be **mentioned by name**. Many biblical stories are alluded to, but the characters involved are not always explicitly named.\n\n### Step 3: Compiling and Verifying the List of Names\nWe will go through the candidates chronologically as they appear in biblical history and verify if their name is present in the text of *Paradise Lost*.\n\n1.  **Adam**: The first man and a main character. Named throughout the epic. (Count: 1)\n2.  **Eve**: The first woman and a main character. Named throughout the epic. (Count: 2)\n3.  **Abel**: The story of Cain and Abel is shown to Adam in a vision (Book XI), but the name \"Abel\" is never explicitly used. Therefore, he is not on the list.\n4.  **Enoch**: Michael explicitly names him in Book XI: \"the one / Of middle age... Of whom the fame he heard was **Enoch**...\" (Count: 3)\n5.  **Noah**: Michael explicitly names him in Book XI when recounting the story of the flood: \"...said thus to **Noah**...\" (Count: 4)\n6.  **Shem**, **Ham**, and **Japhet**: Noahâ€™s three sons are all named together in Book XII: \"whence the second stock of mankind spread, / Out of the Ark, which from the Flood was freed, / ...from the loins of Noahs three sons, **Shem, Ham, / and Japhet**.\" As progenitors of humanity and figures revered as righteous forefathers in some traditions, they all count. (Count: 4 + 3 = 7)\n7.  **Abram (Abraham)**: The patriarch Abraham is named in his earlier form, Abram, in Book XII: \"I see him, but thou canst not, with what faith / He leaves his Gods, his Friends, and native Soil, / Ur of Chaldaea, passing now the Ford / To Haran; after him a cumbrous Train / Of Herds and Flocks, and numerous servitude; / Not wandring poor, but trusting all his wealth / With God, who call'd him, in a land unknown. / Canaan he now attains, I see his Tents / Pitcht about Sechem, and the neighbouring Plain / Of Moreh; There by promise he receives / Gift to his Progeny of all that Land; / From Hamath Northward to the Desert South / (Things by their names I call, though yet unnam'd) / From Hermon East to the great Western Sea, / Mount Hermon, yonder Sea, each place behold / In prospect, as I point them; on the shore / Mount Carmel; here the double-founted stream / Jordan, true limit Eastward; but his Sons / Shall dwell to Senir, that long ridge of Hills. / This ponder, that all Nations of the Earth / Shall in his Seed be blessed; by that Seed / Is meant thy great deliverer, who shall bruise / The Serpents head; whereof to thee anon / Plainlier shall be reveald. This patriarch blest, / Whom faithful **Abram** flames of fire accurst / Found one day serving...\" While a complex passage, the name \"Abram\" is present. (Count: 8)\n8.  **Isaac and Jacob**: Their stories are alluded to as Abraham's \"Son\" and \"Grandchild\" who journey to Egypt (Book XII), but their names do not appear in the text.\n9.  **Joseph**: His story is clearly recounted (the \"Fav'rite Son\" sold into slavery who rises to power in Egypt in Book XII), but he is not mentioned by name.\n10. **Moses**: He is explicitly named in Book XII as the one who leads the Israelites from Egypt: \"...this deliverer **Moses** doth them bring...\" He is also referenced earlier in Book I as \"that Shepherd\". (Count: 9)\n11. **Joshua**: He is named in Book XII as Moses's successor: \"**Joshua** he appoints, / His marischal to lead his people forth...\" (Count: 10)\n12. **David**: The great king is named in Book XII when Michael discusses Israel's future rulers: \"But of the good, the best is **David's** throne...\" (Count: 11)\n13. **Solomon**: David's heir, famous for building the Temple, is referred to as \"his Son\" in Book XII, but his name, Solomon, is not used.\n14. **New Testament Saints (Mary, Apostles)**: The Virgin Mary is alluded to as \"a Virgin\" and \"second Eve\" but is never called Mary by name. The apostles are mentioned as a group (\"his Apostles\"), but none (Peter, John, Paul, etc.) are named individually.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nAfter a careful textual analysis, weeding out figures who are only alluded to and not explicitly named, the following eleven historical saints are mentioned by name in *Paradise Lost*:\n\n1.  Adam\n2.  Eve\n3.  Enoch\n4.  Noah\n5.  Shem\n6.  Ham\n7.  Japhet\n8.  Abram (Abraham)\n9.  Moses\n10. Joshua\n11. David\n\nThe total number is 11.\n\n<<<11>>>"
