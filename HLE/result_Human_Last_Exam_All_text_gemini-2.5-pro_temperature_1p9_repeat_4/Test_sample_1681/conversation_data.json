    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the equilibrium point for the Prisoner's Dilemma when played in quantum space.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Classical Prisoner's Dilemma\n\nFirst, let's analyze the game in its classical form.\nThe payoff matrix is given as:\n```\n          Player B\n         Cooperate (C)  Defect (D)\n      +--------------+------------+\nC     |   (5, 5)     |   (0, 7)   | Player A\n      +--------------+------------+\nD     |   (7, 0)     |   (1, 1)   |\n      +--------------+------------+\n```\nIn classical game theory, the only Nash Equilibrium is (Defect, Defect). This is because, for each player, Defecting is a dominant strategy—it yields a better payoff regardless of the other player's choice. Both players choosing to Defect results in a payoff of (1, 1), which is worse for both than the (5, 5) they could have achieved by cooperating. This suboptimal outcome is the \"dilemma\".\n\n### Step 2: Formulate the Quantum Game\n\nTo play the game in \"quantum space,\" we use a common framework known as the Eisert-Wilkens-Lewenstein (EWL) protocol.\n\n1.  **Initial State**: The game begins with an entangled initial state shared between the two players, Alice and Bob. The question allows us to \"design the initial states for an optimal\" outcome. This means we can choose the level of entanglement. The initial state is created by an entangling operator `J` acting on the base state `|00>` (representing `CC`). A general form for `J` is `J(γ) = cos(γ/2)I⊗I + i sin(γ/2)σ_x⊗σ_x`, where `γ` is the entanglement parameter (`γ=0` is a classical game, `γ=π/2` is a maximally entangled game). To achieve an optimal outcome, we will choose maximal entanglement, `γ = π/2`.\n    *   Initial state: `|ψ_initial> = J(π/2)|00> = (1/√2)(|00> + i|11>)`\n\n2.  **Strategies**: The players' classical strategies, Cooperate (C) and Defect (D), are replaced by quantum operations (unitary matrices).\n    *   **Cooperate (C)** is represented by the identity operator: `C = I = [[1, 0], [0, 1]]`. This is equivalent to \"doing nothing\" to one's qubit.\n    *   **Defect (D)** is represented by a bit-flip like operator: `D = iσ_y = [[0, 1], [-1, 0]]`.\n\n3.  **Payoff Calculation**: Players apply their chosen strategies (e.g., `U_A` for Alice, `U_B` for Bob) to their respective qubits. The final state is `|ψ_final> = (U_A ⊗ U_B)|ψ_initial>`. To determine the outcome, a disentangling operator `J†` is applied, and the resulting state `|ψ'> = J†|ψ_final>` is measured in the classical basis `{|00>, |01>, |10>, |11>}`. The probability of each outcome determines the expected payoff based on the original payoff matrix.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Game with Quantum Strategies\n\nWe now analyze the payoffs when Alice and Bob play the classical strategies {C, D} within this quantum framework, using maximal entanglement (`γ=π/2`).\n\n1.  **Payoff for (C, C)**: If both players cooperate, `U_A=C` and `U_B=C`. The final state is `|00>`, meaning the outcome is (Cooperate, Cooperate).\n    *   Payoff: **(5, 5)**\n\n2.  **Payoff for (D, D)**: If both players defect, `U_A=D` and `U_B=D`. The calculation shows the final state is `|11>`, meaning the outcome is (Defect, Defect).\n    *   Payoff: **(1, 1)**\n\n3.  **Payoff for (C, D)**: Alice cooperates (`C`), Bob defects (`D`). The final state is calculated to be `|10>`, corresponding to the classical outcome (Defect, Cooperate).\n    *   Payoff: **(7, 0)**. *Note the inversion: Alice's cooperation and Bob's defection lead to an outcome that classically corresponds to Alice defecting and Bob cooperating.*\n\n4.  **Payoff for (D, C)**: Alice defects (`D`), Bob cooperates (`C`). By symmetry, the final state is `|01>`, corresponding to the classical outcome (Cooperate, Defect).\n    *   Payoff: **(0, 7)**\n\n### Step 4: Determine the New Equilibrium\n\nWith these payoffs, we can construct the *effective* payoff matrix for the game played in quantum space:\n```\n          Player B\n         Cooperate (C)  Defect (D)\n      +--------------+------------+\nC     |   (5, 5)     |   (7, 0)   | Player A\n      +--------------+------------+\nD     |   (0, 7)     |   (1, 1)   |\n      +--------------+------------+\n```\nNow, let's find the Nash Equilibrium for this new game:\n\n*   **For Alice**:\n    *   If Bob plays C, Alice gets 5 for playing C and 0 for playing D. She prefers C.\n    *   If Bob plays D, Alice gets 7 for playing C and 1 for playing D. She prefers C.\n    *   Playing **C (Cooperate) is a dominant strategy for Alice**.\n\n*   **For Bob**:\n    *   If Alice plays C, Bob gets 5 for playing C and 0 for playing D. He prefers C.\n    *   If Alice plays D, Bob gets 7 for playing C and 1 for playing D. He prefers C.\n    *   Playing **C (Cooperate) is a dominant strategy for Bob**.\n\nSince cooperating is the dominant strategy for both players, the only Nash Equilibrium is for both players to cooperate. The classical dilemma is resolved. Players no longer have an incentive to defect.\n\nThe equilibrium point of the game is the strategy pair (Cooperate, Cooperate), which results in the payoff (5, 5).\n\n<<< (5, 5) >>>"
