    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the nonabelian filled groups of order `2q^m`.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Core Definitions\n\n1.  **Product-Free Set:** A subset `S` of a group `G` is called product-free if for any two elements `x, y` in `S` (not necessarily distinct), their product `xy` is not in `S`. In set notation, `S⋅S ∩ S = ∅`.\n    *   A crucial point is that any product-free set `S` cannot contain the identity element `e`, because if `e ∈ S` and `S` is non-empty, then for any `s ∈ S`, `e⋅s = s`, which must not be in `S`. This is a contradiction. Therefore, `e ∉ S`.\n\n2.  **Maximal by Inclusion Product-Free (MIPF) Set:** A product-free set `S` is maximal by inclusion if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set. This means that for any element `g ∈ G \\ S`, the set `S ∪ {g}` is no longer product-free.\n\n3.  **Fills G:** A subset `S` of `G` fills `G` if every non-identity element of `G` is either in `S` or its inverse is in `S`. Mathematically, `G = S ∪ S⁻¹ ∪ {e}`, where `S⁻¹ = {s⁻¹ | s ∈ S}`.\n\n4.  **Filled Group:** A group `G` is filled if **every** MIPF set in `G` fills `G`. This is a very strong condition that places significant constraints on the group's structure.\n\n### Step 2: Use a Characterization Theorem for Filled Groups\n\nAnalyzing the condition \"every MIPF set fills G\" directly is complicated. Fortunately, there is a known and powerful theorem that provides an equivalent, more algebraic characterization of finite filled groups.\n\n**Theorem:** A finite group `G` is a filled group if and only if both of the following conditions hold:\n1.  `G` does not contain a subgroup isomorphic to `C_p × C_p` for any odd prime `p`.\n2.  If `G` contains a subgroup isomorphic to `C_2 × C_2` (the Klein four-group), then `G` must be isomorphic to the alternating group `A_4` or the symmetric group `S_4`.\n\nWe will apply this theorem to find the nonabelian groups of order `2q^m`.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze Groups of Order `2q^m`\n\nLet `G` be a nonabelian group of order `|G| = 2q^m`, where `q` is an odd prime and `m` is a natural number (`m ≥ 1`).\n\n**Apply Condition 1 of the Theorem:**\nThe group `G` must not contain a subgroup isomorphic to `C_p × C_p` for any odd prime `p`. The only odd prime whose square could possibly divide `|G|` is `q`. Thus, this condition simplifies to:\n*   `G` must not contain a subgroup isomorphic to `C_q × C_q`.\n\nA subgroup of order `q²` must be contained within a Sylow `q`-subgroup of `G`. Let `Q` be a Sylow `q`-subgroup of `G`, so `|Q| = q^m`. The condition that `G` has no `C_q × C_q` subgroup implies that `Q` has no `C_q × C_q` subgroup.\n\nThere is a fundamental result in the theory of `p`-groups: A `p`-group has no subgroup isomorphic to `C_p × C_p` if and only if it is either cyclic or a (possibly generalized) quaternion group.\n*   In our case, `Q` is a `q`-group where `q` is an **odd** prime. Quaternion groups have order a power of 2. Therefore, `Q` cannot be a quaternion group.\n*   This forces the Sylow `q`-subgroup `Q` to be **cyclic**. So, `Q ≅ C_{q^m}`.\n\n**Apply Condition 2 of the Theorem:**\nThis condition deals with the case where `G` contains a subgroup isomorphic to `C_2 × C_2`.\n*   A Sylow 2-subgroup of `G` has order 2. Let it be `P`. Since `|P|=2`, `P` is isomorphic to `C_2`.\n*   Any 2-subgroup of `G` must be contained in a conjugate of `P`. Since `P` itself has order 2, `G` cannot contain a subgroup of order 4 like `C_2 × C_2`.\n*   Therefore, this condition is automatically satisfied for any group of order `2q^m`.\n*   Furthermore, the exceptional cases `A_4` (`|A_4|=12=2^2 ⋅ 3`) and `S_4` (`|S_4|=24=2^3 ⋅ 3`) do not have orders of the form `2q^m`, as their Sylow 2-subgroup has order greater than 2.\n\n**Conclusion so far:** A nonabelian group `G` of order `2q^m` is filled if and only if its Sylow `q`-subgroup is cyclic.\n\n### Step 4: Classify the Resulting Groups\n\nNow we need to find all nonabelian groups `G` of order `2q^m` that have a cyclic Sylow `q`-subgroup `Q ≅ C_{q^m}`.\n\n1.  **Group Structure:** By Sylow's Theorems, the number of Sylow `q`-subgroups, `n_q`, must divide 2. So `n_q = 1` or `n_q = 2`. Also, `n_q ≡ 1 (mod q)`.\n    *   If `n_q = 2`, then `2 ≡ 1 (mod q)`, which means `q` divides `1`, an impossibility.\n    *   Therefore, `n_q = 1`, and the Sylow `q`-subgroup `Q` is normal in `G`.\n\n2.  **Semidirect Product:** Since `Q` is normal, `G` is a semidirect product of `Q` and a Sylow 2-subgroup `P ≅ C_2`.\n    *   `G ≅ Q ⋊ P ≅ C_{q^m} ⋊ C_2`.\n\n3.  **Constructing the Semidirect Product:** A semidirect product `C_{q^m} ⋊ C_2` is determined by a homomorphism `φ: C_2 → Aut(C_{q^m})`.\n    *   Let `C_2 = <b>`. The homomorphism `φ` is determined by where it sends the generator `b`. The element `φ(b)` must be an automorphism of `C_{q^m}` whose order divides the order of `b`, which is 2. So `(φ(b))^2` must be the identity automorphism.\n    *   The group `G` is abelian if and only if `φ` is the trivial homomorphism (i.e., `φ(b)` is the identity automorphism). This would give the direct product `C_{q^m} × C_2 ≅ C_{2q^m}`, which is abelian. We are looking for nonabelian groups.\n    *   Therefore, `φ` must be a nontrivial homomorphism. This means `φ(b)` must be an element of order 2 in `Aut(C_{q^m})`.\n\n4.  **Finding Automorphisms of Order 2:** The automorphism group of the cyclic group `C_{q^m}` is isomorphic to the group of units of the ring `Z/q^m Z`.\n    *   `Aut(C_{q^m}) ≅ (Z/q^m Z)^*`.\n    *   The order of this group is `|Aut(C_{q^m})| = φ_{Euler}(q^m) = q^m - q^{m-1} = q^{m-1}(q-1)`.\n    *   Since `q` is an odd prime, `q-1` is even, so the order of the automorphism group is even. By Cauchy's Theorem, it contains an element of order 2.\n    *   An element of order 2 in `(Z/q^m Z)^*` is a number `x` such that `x² ≡ 1 (mod q^m)` but `x <binary data, 3 bytes> 1 (mod q^m)`.\n    *   The congruence `x² ≡ 1 (mod q^m)` is equivalent to `(x-1)(x+1) ≡ 0 (mod q^m)`. Since `q` is an odd prime, `q` cannot divide both `x-1` and `x+1` (their difference is 2). This means that either `q^m | (x-1)` or `q^m | (x+1)`.\n    *   The solutions are `x ≡ 1 (mod q^m)` and `x ≡ -1 (mod q^m)`.\n    *   The only solution other than the identity is `x ≡ -1 (mod q^m)`.\n    *   Thus, `Aut(C_{q^m})` has a unique element of order 2. This corresponds to the inversion automorphism `a ↦ a⁻¹` for `a ∈ C_{q^m}`.\n\n5.  **Final Group Identification:** Since there is only one non-trivial homomorphism from `C_2` to `Aut(C_{q^m})`, for each pair `(q, m)`, there is exactly one nonabelian group of order `2q^m` whose Sylow `q`-subgroup is cyclic. This group is defined by the presentation:\n    `G = <a, b | a^(q^m) = e, b^2 = e, bab⁻¹ = a⁻¹>`\n    This is the definition of the **dihedral group** of order `2q^m`, denoted `D_{2q^m}`.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe nonabelian groups of order `2q^m` for an odd prime `q` and natural number `m` that are filled are precisely the groups whose Sylow `q`-subgroup is cyclic. Our analysis shows that for any such `q` and `m`, there is a unique such nonabelian group: the dihedral group `D_{2q^m}`.\n\nFinal Answer: The nonabelian filled groups of order `2q^m` for odd prime `q` and natural number `m` are the dihedral groups `D_{2q^m}`.\n\n<<<The dihedral groups D_{2q^m} for every odd prime q and natural number m.>>>"
