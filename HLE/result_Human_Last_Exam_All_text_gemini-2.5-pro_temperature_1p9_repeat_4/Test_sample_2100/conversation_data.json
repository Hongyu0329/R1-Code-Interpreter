    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the first clue.**\nThe quote \"a joy-discovering sailor\" comes from the Russian poet Andrei Voznesensky. In the original Russian, it is \"мореплаватель, открывавший радость.\" This points to an explorer or navigator from Russian history who is remembered for a significant and perhaps romanticized discovery or journey.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the second clue.**\nThe question \"Where is your grave, even a mound?\" also from Voznesensky, indicates that this historical figure's burial site was lost or unknown for a long period. This was a historical mystery significant enough for a prominent poet to lament it.\n\n**Step 3: Connect the clues to a specific work.**\nBoth of these quotes are famously from Voznesensky's poem \"Saga,\" which formed the libretto for the immensely popular Soviet rock opera \"Juno and Avos\" (\"Юнона и Авось\"). The opera tells the tragic love story of a Russian explorer and a young Spanish-Californian woman. The \"joy-discovering sailor\" is the protagonist of this story.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the man.**\nThe protagonist of \"Juno and Avos\" is the real historical figure Nikolai Petrovich Rezanov (1764-1807). He was a Russian nobleman, diplomat, and one of the founders of the Russian-American Company. His story fits the description of an explorer.\n\n**Step 5: Verify the mystery of the grave.**\nNikolai Rezanov died and was buried in Krasnoyarsk in 1807, in the cemetery of the Voskresensky Cathedral. In the 1930s, under Soviet rule, the cathedral and its cemetery were demolished, and his grave was lost. This perfectly matches the line, \"Where is your grave, even a mound?\".\n\n**Step 6: Analyze the final clue and solve the mystery.**\nThe question states, \"The answer to this question emerged in the late 1980s.\" Following the huge success of \"Juno and Avos,\" there was renewed public interest in Rezanov's fate. While his physical remains were not definitively found, the approximate location of his grave was identified. A highly symbolic event occurred in 1989 when the sheriff of Monterey, California, brought soil from the grave of Rezanov's love, Concepción Argüello, and sprinkled it over Rezanov's presumed resting place in Krasnoyarsk. This act provided a powerful, symbolic \"answer\" to the question of his grave, bringing the famous love story to a form of closure. This event fits the \"late 1980s\" timeline perfectly.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe man described is Nikolai Rezanov. The question asks for his last name.\n\n<<<Rezanov>>>"
