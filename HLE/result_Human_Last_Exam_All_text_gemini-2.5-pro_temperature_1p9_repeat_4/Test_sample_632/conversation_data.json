    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Location:** Piazza della Rotonda, Rome.\n    *   **Key Landmark:** The Pantheon church.\n    *   **Object:** A \"unique architectural feature.\"\n    *   **Action:** Removed by the city administration.\n    *   **Date:** Until 1950 (implying removal in or around 1950).\n\n2.  **Initial Research & Key Candidates:** The most famous \"unique architectural feature\" ever removed from the Pantheon is a pair of twin bell towers (campanili).\n\n3.  **Investigating the Bell Towers:**\n    *   These towers were constructed in the 17th century (between 1626 and 1636) during the papacy of Pope Urban VIII (Maffeo Barberini).\n    *   Their design is often attributed to the famous baroque artist Gian Lorenzo Bernini, though some art historians attribute them to his contemporaries like Carlo Maderno or Francesco Borromini.\n    *   The towers were highly controversial from the moment they were built. Neoclassical critics and the Roman populace felt they were ugly and incongruous with the classical, harmonious facade of the ancient Pantheon.\n    *   They were given the derogatory nickname **\"le orecchie d'asino\"** or **\"the donkey's ears.\"** This fits the description of a \"unique\" (and in this case, uniquely disliked) architectural feature.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **The Date Discrepancy:** This is the most critical point of the analysis. The question states the feature was removed in 1950. However, historical records confirm that the famous \"donkey's ears\" bell towers were demolished much earlier, in **1883**. The removal was ordered by Guido Baccelli, the then-Minister of Public Education of the newly unified Kingdom of Italy, to restore the Pantheon to its perceived original classical state.\n*   **Alternative Possibilities for 1950:** Were there any other features removed in 1950? In the post-WWII era, Rome's urban landscape was being modernized. This included the removal of some tram lines from the historic center. While tram lines and their overhead electrical wires were present in or near the piazza, they are generally considered urban infrastructure rather than a \"unique architectural feature\" of the building itself. There is no major, widely documented architectural feature that was removed from the Pantheon or the Piazza in 1950.\n*   **Conclusion on the Premise:** It is highly probable that the question contains a factual error regarding the date. The \"twin bell towers\" are the only element that perfectly fits the description of a \"unique architectural feature\" that was controversially added to the Pantheon and later removed by an administrative body. The details match perfectly, with the sole exception of the year.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis, the question is almost certainly referring to the twin bell towers, despite the incorrect year provided. They are the most famous example of a feature removed from the Pantheon in the Piazza della Rotonda.\n\n<<<The twin bell towers, popularly known as \"the donkey's ears\" (le orecchie d'asino).>>>"
