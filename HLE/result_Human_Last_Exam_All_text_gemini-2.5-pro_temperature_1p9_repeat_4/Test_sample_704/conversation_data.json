    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the colours in the specified range.**\nThe question asks for the note corresponding to the range \"between the colour produced when combining yellow and blue, and blue itself\".\n*   On a colour wheel, mixing or finding the intermediate colour between yellow and blue results in **Green**.\n*   Therefore, the specified range on Newton's colour circle is the one that spans from **Green** to **Blue**.\n\n**Step 2: Understand Newton's Colour Circle and its musical correspondence.**\nIsaac Newton, in his work *Opticks*, proposed a direct analogy between the seven colours of the spectrum and the seven notes of a musical scale. He created a circular diagram where the spectrum was wrapped into a wheel. He divided this circle into seven sectors, with the size of each sector proportional to the width of the corresponding colour band in the spectrum.\n\n**Step 3: Determine how musical notes are mapped to the colours.**\nA crucial point in Newton's system is that he assigned the musical notes not to the middle of the colour regions, but to the **boundaries** or dividing lines between them. His mapping, analogous to the proportions of the Dorian musical mode, is as follows:\n*   The boundary between Red and Orange is the note D.\n*   The boundary between Orange and Yellow is the note E.\n*   The boundary between Yellow and Green is the note F.\n*   **The boundary between Green and Blue is the note G.**\n*   The boundary between Blue and Indigo is the note A.\n*   The boundary between Indigo and Violet is the note B.\n*   The boundary between Violet and Red is the note C.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the specific note for the given range.**\nThe question asks for the single musical note that \"corresponds to the range between\" Green and Blue. Based on Newton's original mapping, this corresponds to the boundary line that separates the Green sector from the Blue sector. As established in the previous step, the note located at this precise boundary is **G**.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nThe colour produced by combining yellow and blue is green. The range is thus from green to blue. On Newton's colour circle, the musical note G marks the division between the green and blue segments.\n\n<<<G>>>"
