    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the 4-point DFT for the given sequence.\n\n**1. Understand the Problem**\n\nWe are given the 4-point DFTs, X(k) and H(k), for two 4-point sequences, x(n) and h(n).\n*   `X(k) = DFT[x(n)] = [1, j, -1, -j]`\n*   `H(k) = DFT[h(n)] = [0, 1+j, 1, 1-j]`\n\nWe need to find the 8-point DFT, let's call it Y(k), for a new 8-point sequence, y(n), which is created by interleaving x(n) and h(n):\n*   `y(n) = {x(0), h(0), x(1), h(1), x(2), h(2), x(3), h(3)}`\n\n**2. Relate the New Sequence to the Original Sequences**\n\nThe key is to express the new sequence y(n) in terms of x(n) and h(n). We can see a pattern based on even and odd indices of y(n):\n*   The even-indexed terms of y(n) are the terms from x(n): `y(2m) = x(m)` for m = 0, 1, 2, 3.\n*   The odd-indexed terms of y(n) are the terms from h(n): `y(2m+1) = h(m)` for m = 0, 1, 2, 3.\n\n**3. Use the DFT Definition and Decimation-in-Time Principle**\n\nThe 8-point DFT of y(n) is defined as:\n`Y(k) = sum_{n=0 to 7} y(n) * W_8^(nk)` , where `W_N = e^(-j*2*pi/N)` is the twiddle factor.\n\nWe can split this summation into even and odd indices of 'n':\n`Y(k) = sum_{m=0 to 3} y(2m) * W_8^((2m)k) + sum_{m=0 to 3} y(2m+1) * W_8^((2m+1)k)`\n\nNow, substitute `y(2m) = x(m)` and `y(2m+1) = h(m)`:\n`Y(k) = sum_{m=0 to 3} x(m) * W_8^(2mk) + sum_{m=0 to 3} h(m) * W_8^((2m+1)k)`\n\nLet's simplify the twiddle factors.\n*   `W_8^(2mk) = (W_8^2)^(mk) = (e^(-j*2*pi/8))^2mk = e^(-j*2*pi*mk/4) = W_4^(mk)`\n*   `W_8^((2m+1)k) = W_8^(2mk) * W_8^k = W_4^(mk) * W_8^k`\n\nSubstitute these back into the equation for Y(k):\n`Y(k) = sum_{m=0 to 3} x(m) * W_4^(mk) + W_8^k * sum_{m=0 to 3} h(m) * W_4^(mk)`\n\nWe can recognize the summations as the 4-point DFTs of x(n) and h(n).\n*   `sum_{m=0 to 3} x(m) * W_4^(mk) = X(k)`\n*   `sum_{m=0 to 3} h(m) * W_4^(mk) = H(k)`\n\nSince the 4-point DFTs are periodic with period 4, for the 8-point DFT Y(k), we use `X(k mod 4)` and `H(k mod 4)`. This gives us the final formula:\n`Y(k) = X(k mod 4) + W_8^k * H(k mod 4)` for `k = 0, 1, 2, ..., 7`.\n\n**4. Perform the Calculation**\n\nFirst, list the required values:\n*   `X(k) = [1, j, -1, -j]`\n*   `H(k) = [0, 1+j, 1, 1-j]`\n*   `W_8^0 = 1`\n*   `W_8^1 = e^(-j*pi/4) = (1/√2) - j(1/√2)`\n*   `W_8^2 = e^(-j*pi/2) = -j`\n*   `W_8^3 = e^(-j*3pi/4) = -(1/√2) - j(1/√2)`\n*   `W_8^4 = e^(-j*pi) = -1`\n*   `W_8^5 = e^(-j*5pi/4) = -(1/√2) + j(1/√2)`\n*   `W_8^6 = e^(-j*3pi/2) = j`\n*   `W_8^7 = e^(-j*7pi/4) = (1/√2) + j(1/√2)`\n\nNow, calculate each component of Y(k):\n*   **Y(0)** (k=0, k mod 4 = 0): `Y(0) = X(0) + W_8^0 * H(0) = 1 + 1 * 0 = 1`\n*   **Y(1)** (k=1, k mod 4 = 1): `Y(1) = X(1) + W_8^1 * H(1) = j + ((1/√2) - j(1/√2)) * (1+j) = j + (1/√2) * (1-j)(1+j) = j + (1/√2) * (1 - j^2) = j + (1/√2) * 2 = j + √2`\n*   **Y(2)** (k=2, k mod 4 = 2): `Y(2) = X(2) + W_8^2 * H(2) = -1 + (-j) * 1 = -1 - j`\n*   **Y(3)** (k=3, k mod 4 = 3): `Y(3) = X(3) + W_8^3 * H(3) = -j + (-(1/√2) - j(1/√2)) * (1-j) = -j - (1/√2) * (1+j)(1-j) = -j - (1/√2) * (1 - j^2) = -j - (1/√2) * 2 = -j - √2`\n*   **Y(4)** (k=4, k mod 4 = 0): `Y(4) = X(0) + W_8^4 * H(0) = 1 + (-1) * 0 = 1`\n*   **Y(5)** (k=5, k mod 4 = 1): `Y(5) = X(1) + W_8^5 * H(1) = j + (-(1/√2) + j(1/√2)) * (1+j) = j - (1/√2) * (1-j)(1+j) = j - (1/√2) * (1 - j^2) = j - (1/√2) * 2 = j - √2`\n*   **Y(6)** (k=6, k mod 4 = 2): `Y(6) = X(2) + W_8^6 * H(2) = -1 + j * 1 = -1 + j`\n*   **Y(7)** (k=7, k mod 4 = 3): `Y(7) = X(3) + W_8^7 * H(3) = -j + ((1/√2) + j(1/√2)) * (1-j) = -j + (1/√2) * (1+j)(1-j) = -j + (1/√2) * (1 - j^2) = -j + (1/√2) * 2 = -j + √2`\n\n**5. Final Answer**\n\nCombining all the results, the 8-point DFT is:\nY(k) = [1, √2 + j, -1 - j, -√2 - j, 1, -√2 + j, -1 + j, √2 - j]\n\n<<<[1, 1.414+j, -1-j, -1.414-j, 1, -1.414+j, -1+j, 1.414-j]>>>"
