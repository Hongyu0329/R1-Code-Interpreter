    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the minimum number of diffraction gratings required.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to construct a \"full spectral volume,\" also known as a hyperspectral data cube or (x, y, λ) data cube. This is a three-dimensional dataset where for each spatial pixel (x, y) in a two-dimensional scene, we have its complete spectrum (intensity for each wavelength, λ).\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Constraints**\n1.  **Single Image:** All the necessary data must be captured in a single snapshot on a 2D camera sensor. This means we cannot change the setup (e.g., rotate the grating) and take multiple pictures.\n2.  **Computed Tomography (CT) Principle:** The reconstruction method must be based on the principles of computed tomography.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Role of Computed Tomography**\nComputed Tomography is a mathematical technique used to reconstruct an N-dimensional object from its (N-1)-dimensional projections. The key requirement of CT is that these projections must be taken from multiple different angles relative to the object. A single projection or multiple projections from the same angle is not enough to perform a full reconstruction. This is a fundamental concept described by the Projection-Slice Theorem.\n\n**Step 4: Relate the Problem to CT**\nIn this problem, the \"object\" we want to reconstruct is the 3D spectral data cube `f(x, y, λ)`. The \"projections\" are the 2D images captured by the camera sensor after the light has passed through the diffraction grating(s). Our task is to determine the minimum number of gratings needed to generate a sufficient set of these 2D projections to reconstruct the 3D object, all within a single snapshot.\n\n**Step 5: Analyze the Effect of a Single (1D) Diffraction Grating**\nA standard diffraction grating has parallel lines and disperses light in one direction, perpendicular to the lines.\n*   Let's assume the grating lines are vertical. It will disperse the light from a point source horizontally.\n*   This means that the grating \"mixes\" or encodes the horizontal spatial coordinate `x` with the wavelength `λ`. The vertical spatial coordinate `y` remains unchanged.\n*   The resulting image on the detector is a projection of the 3D data cube `f(x, y, λ)`.\n*   A single 1D grating produces multiple diffraction orders (0th, +1st, -1st, etc.). The 0th order is an undispersed image (a projection along the λ-axis). The +1st and -1st orders are dispersed.\n*   **Crucial Point:** All dispersed orders (+1, -1, +2, etc.) from this single 1D grating represent projections along the same axis in the `(x,y,λ)` space. They mix `x` and `λ` but never `y` and `λ`. This is analogous to a medical CT scanner taking multiple readings without rotating. This data is insufficient for tomographic reconstruction of the 3D data cube. You cannot resolve ambiguities between space and spectrum using only one dispersion direction.\n\n**Step 6: Analyze the Effect of a Second Diffraction Grating**\nTo satisfy the requirements of computed tomography, we need projections from different \"viewing angles.\" In this context, that means we need to mix the coordinates in a different way.\n*   The simplest way to get a new, distinct projection is to add a second 1D diffraction grating, oriented orthogonally to the first (e.g., with horizontal lines).\n*   This second grating will disperse light vertically, mixing the `y` coordinate with the wavelength `λ`.\n*   By using two orthogonal gratings, we now have access to projections that mix `(x, λ)` and projections that mix `(y, λ)`.\n*   These two gratings can be implemented as two separate components in series or, more commonly, as a single component called a \"2D crossed grating\" which has a grid-like pattern etched onto it. A 2D grating produces a 2D array of diffraction orders on the sensor (e.g., orders (1,0), (0,1), (1,1), etc.). Each of these orders is a unique 2D projection of the 3D data cube. This set of varied projections *is* sufficient for a CT algorithm to reconstruct the original `f(x, y, λ)` cube.\n\n**Step 7: Conclude the Minimum Number**\n*   We established that one 1D grating is insufficient because it does not provide the necessary variety of projection angles required by the principle of computed tomography.\n*   We established that a system employing two orthogonal gratings provides a sufficient set of projections for reconstruction.\n*   Therefore, the minimum number of fundamental gratings (or dispersion axes) required is two. The question asks for the \"minimum number of diffraction gratings,\" which, based on the physical requirements of the tomographic method, translates to the need for two distinct, non-parallel grating patterns.\n\nFinal Careful Points:\n*   The constraint \"using computed tomography\" is the key. It dictates the need for multiple projection angles.\n*   The constraint \"from a single image\" means these multiple projections must be generated simultaneously.\n*   A single 1D grating cannot provide the necessary variety of projection angles.\n*   Two orthogonal gratings (functionally, if not physically) are the minimum required to provide the necessary variety of projections (e.g., dispersion in x and dispersion in y) to make the CT problem solvable.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of gratings necessary is 2.\n\n<<<B>>>"
