A threshold signature scheme based on the Schnorr signature algorithm, closely mirroring the design of FROST (Flexible Round-Optimized Schnorr Threshold signatures), meets all the requirements. The design proceeds as follows:

1.  **Prerequisites:** A Distributed Key Generation (DKG) based on Verifiable Secret Sharing (e.g., Pedersen VSS) is performed once to give each of the `n` participants a secret key share `x_i` and a corresponding public verification key `Y_i = g^{x_i}`. This also establishes a single group public key `Y`.

2.  **Signing Protocol (for a group of `t` signers):**
    *   **Round 1 (Commitment):** Each of the `t` signers `i` generates two secret nonces, `d_i` and `e_i`, and broadcasts their public commitments, `(D_i, E_i) = (g^{d_i}, g^{e_i})`.
    *   **Round 2 (Response):** After receiving all commitments, each signer `i` locally computes a binding value `ρ_i`, the group commitment `R`, the challenge `c`, and their Lagrange coefficient `λ_i`. They then compute their partial signature `z_i = d_i + (e_i \cdot ρ_i) + (c \cdot λ_i \cdot x_i)` and broadcast it.

3.  **Signature Aggregation:** A designated aggregator collects the `t` partial signatures.
    *   **Verification (for Robustness):** The aggregator first verifies each partial signature `z_i` using the corresponding public values from Round 1 and the DKG (`D_i`, `E_i`, `Y_i`). This identifies and excludes any malicious participants who submit invalid shares.
    *   **Combination:** If all partial signatures are valid, the aggregator sums them to create the final signature value `s = \sum z_i`. The final signature, `(R, s)`, is a standard Schnorr signature verifiable by anyone using the single group public key `Y`.

This design is tightly secure due to the two-nonce commitment scheme and nonce binding, and it is robust because individual contributions can be verified before aggregation.
