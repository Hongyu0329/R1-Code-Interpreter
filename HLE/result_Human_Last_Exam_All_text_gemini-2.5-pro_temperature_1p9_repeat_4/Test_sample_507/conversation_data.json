    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to arrive at the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Deconstructing the Question**\n\nThe question asks for two specific things:\n1.  Two languages from two distinct Asian cultures.\n2.  These cultures must have \"no direct contact,\" meaning the word similarities are not due to recent borrowing or a close linguistic relationship.\n3.  In these two languages, the words for \"broom,\" \"mom,\" and \"dad\" must be nearly identical or highly similar.\n\n**Step 2: Identifying Key Constraints and Careful Points**\n\n*   **\"No Direct Contact\":** This is the most crucial constraint. It pushes the answer away from neighboring languages (e.g., Malay and Tagalog) or languages with a shared recent ancestor. We must look for geographically and culturally distant pairs, such as a language from West/Central Asia and another from East Asia. The similarities found should ideally be coincidental or arise from universal linguistic phenomena.\n*   **\"Mom\" and \"Dad\":** The words for \"mom\" and \"dad\" are famously similar across many unrelated languages worldwide. This is a well-known linguistic phenomenon related to \"nursery words.\" The first sounds infants learn to make are often simple labial sounds like /m/, /p/, and /b/. Thus, words like `mama`, `nana`, `papa`, and `baba` appear globally. Finding similarity here is relatively easy, and it doesn't necessarily imply contact.\n*   **\"Broom\":** This is the key word that makes the question challenging. Unlike \"mom\" or \"dad,\" the word for a \"broom\" (a cultural tool) has no universal phonetic basis. A strong similarity for this word between two languages with no direct contact would almost certainly have to be a pure coincidence. Therefore, our search should focus on finding this specific coincidental match first.\n\n**Step 3: Searching for Candidate Languages and Comparing Vocabulary**\n\nBased on the constraints, a good strategy is to select one language from West or Central Asia and another from East Asia. Let's choose **Farsi (Persian)** and **Korean**.\n\n*   **Cultures:** Persian culture (centered in modern-day Iran, West/Central Asia) and Korean culture (Korean Peninsula, East Asia).\n*   **Contact:** These two cultures are thousands of kilometers apart and belong to completely different language families (Farsi is Indo-European; Korean is a language isolate). While historical trade routes like the Silk Road existed, there was no sustained, direct contact that would lead to the borrowing of such basic, common vocabulary. This pair perfectly satisfies the \"no direct contact\" rule.\n\n**Step 4: Word Comparison**\n\nLet's compare the three specific words in Farsi and Korean.\n\n1.  **BROOM:**\n    *   Farsi (Persian): **Jāru** (جارو)\n    *   Korean: **Bitjaru** (빗자루)\n    *   **Analysis:** This is an incredible phonetic coincidence. The Korean word is a compound of *bit* (빗), meaning \"comb,\" and *jaru* (자루), which here refers to the broom part (it can also mean \"handle\"). The functional part of the Korean word, ***jaru***, is nearly identical to the complete Farsi word, ***Jāru***. This is the lynchpin of our answer.\n\n2.  **DAD:**\n    *   Farsi (Persian): **Bābā** (بابا)\n    *   Korean: **Appa** (아빠)\n    *   **Analysis:** Both words are classic \"nursery words\" for \"father.\" They both use a reduplicated labial stop consonant (`b` and `p` are phonetically very similar, with `b` being the voiced version of `p`). This type of word formation for \"dad\" is a near-universal pattern. Therefore, they can be considered \"highly similar\" in structure, origin, and sound.\n\n3.  **MOM:**\n    *   Farsi (Persian): **Māmān** (مامان)\n    *   Korean: **Eomma** (엄마)\n    *   **Analysis:** Similar to the words for \"dad,\" these are nursery words for \"mother.\" Both are fundamentally based on the bilabial nasal sound /m/, which is the most common feature of words for \"mother\" worldwide (`ma`, `mama`, `ama`, etc.). While the vowels differ, the core consonantal sound and the nursery origin make them highly similar in the context of global linguistic patterns.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nFarsi and Korean represent two Asian languages from two very distant cultures with no direct contact. They demonstrate a remarkable similarity in the words for \"broom\" (a coincidence), and for \"mom\" and \"dad\" (a result of the universal nursery word phenomenon), thus fulfilling all the conditions of the question.\n\n<<<The two languages are Farsi (Persian) and Korean.\nBroom: In Farsi, \"Jāru\" (جارو); in Korean, \"(Bit)jaru\" (자루).\nMom: In Farsi, \"Māmān\" (مامان); in Korean, \"Eomma\" (엄마).\nDad: In Farsi, \"Bābā\" (بابا); in Korean, \"Appa\" (아빠).>>>"
