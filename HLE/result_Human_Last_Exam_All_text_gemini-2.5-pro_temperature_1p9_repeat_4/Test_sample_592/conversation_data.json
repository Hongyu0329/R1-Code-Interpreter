    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to arrive at the correct answer.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Question:** The user wants to know the specific US city to which the character Tommaso moves in the 1997 film *Ovosodo*.\n2.  **Identify Key Information:**\n    *   Movie: *Ovosodo* (1997)\n    *   Character: Tommaso\n    *   Actor: Marco Cocci\n    *   Action: Moves to the United States.\n    *   Goal: Find the name of the US city.\n3.  **Verify the Character and Plot Point:** First, we must confirm that Tommaso is the correct character who moves to the US. In the film's plot, Tommaso is the wealthy best friend of the protagonist, Pietro. A major divergence in their life paths occurs when Tommaso, seeking a different future from their hometown of Livorno, decides to move abroad. Plot summaries confirm he moves to the United States.\n4.  **Find the Specific City:** Researching detailed plot synopses of *Ovosodo* reveals Tommaso's destination. While the protagonist Pietro's life remains centered in Italy, Tommaso's path leads him to America. Specifically, he chooses to move to New York City to pursue his ambitions.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Character Distinction:** It's crucial not to confuse Tommaso (the friend who leaves, played by Marco Cocci) with the main protagonist, Pietro (played by Edoardo Gabbriellini), who stays in Livorno. The question is specifically about Tommaso.\n*   **Film Context:** Tommaso's move to a major US city is thematically important. It contrasts his upper-middle-class opportunities and global aspirations with Pietro's working-class struggles and more localized life.\n*   **Source Verification:** The information should be confirmed from reliable film summaries or reviews, as minor plot details can sometimes be misremembered or incorrectly reported on fan forums. Cross-referencing Italian sources about the film *Ovosodo* confirms the city.\n\nBased on this analysis, the character Tommaso moves to New York City.\n\n<<<New York>>>"
