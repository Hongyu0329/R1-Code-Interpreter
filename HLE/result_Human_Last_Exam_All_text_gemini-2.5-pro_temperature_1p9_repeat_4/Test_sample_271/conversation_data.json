    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Factor the polynomial**\nLet $P(x) = x^7 - 2 x^5 - 9 x^3 + 3 x^2 + 18 x - 6$. We can try to find common factors in the terms of the polynomial.\nLet's group the terms:\n$P(x) = (x^7 - 2x^5) - (9x^3 - 18x) + (3x^2 - 6)$\n$P(x) = x^5(x^2 - 2) - 9x(x^2 - 2) + 3(x^2 - 2)$\nWe can see a common factor of $(x^2 - 2)$.\n$P(x) = (x^5 - 9x + 3)(x^2 - 2)$\nSo, the splitting field $K$ of $P(x)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is the compositum of the splitting fields of its irreducible factors. The factors are $f_1(x) = x^2 - 2$ and $f_2(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the factors and their Galois groups**\n1.  **For $f_1(x) = x^2 - 2$**:\n    This polynomial is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$ (by Eisenstein's criterion with $p=2$, or because its roots $\\pm\\sqrt{2}$ are not in $\\mathbb{Q}$). The splitting field is $K_1 = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. The Galois group is $Gal(K_1/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong C_2$, the cyclic group of order 2.\n\n2.  **For $f_2(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$**:\n    *   **Irreducibility:** We can use Eisenstein's criterion with the prime $p=3$. The coefficients are $a_5=1, a_4=0, a_3=0, a_2=0, a_1=-9, a_0=3$. The prime $p=3$ divides all coefficients except the leading one, $a_5=1$. Also, $p^2=9$ does not divide the constant term $a_0=3$. Thus, $f_2(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n    *   **Galois group:** Since $f_2(x)$ is an irreducible polynomial of degree 5, its Galois group $G_2 = Gal(K_2/\\mathbb{Q})$ (where $K_2$ is the splitting field of $f_2$) is a transitive subgroup of $S_5$.\n    *   To identify the specific subgroup, we determine the number of real roots. Let's analyze the derivative: $f_2'(x) = 5x^4 - 9$. The critical points are the roots of $f_2'(x)=0$, so $x^4=9/5$. This gives two real critical points $x = \\pm \\sqrt[4]{9/5}$.\n    *   The value of $f_2(x)$ at the local maximum (at $x = -\\sqrt[4]{9/5}$) is positive, and the value at the local minimum (at $x = \\sqrt[4]{9/5}$) is negative. This pattern implies that the polynomial has exactly three real roots and two complex conjugate roots.\n    *   For an irreducible polynomial of prime degree $p$, if it has exactly two non-real roots, its Galois group over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is the full symmetric group $S_p$. Here $p=5$. The complex conjugation acts as a transposition in the Galois group, and since the group is a transitive subgroup of $S_5$ containing a transposition and a 5-cycle (which exists in any transitive subgroup of $S_5$ by Cauchy's theorem as 5 is prime), the group must be $S_5$.\n    *   So, $Gal(K_2/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong S_5$. The degree of the extension is $[K_2:\\mathbb{Q}] = |S_5| = 120$.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Galois group of K over Q**\nThe splitting field of $P(x)$ is $K = K_1K_2 = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\text{roots of } f_2)$. The Galois group $G = Gal(K/\\mathbb{Q})$ satisfies $G \\cong Gal(K_1/\\mathbb{Q}) \\times Gal(K_2/\\mathbb{Q})$ if $K_1 \\cap K_2 = \\mathbb{Q}$.\nThe field $K_2$ is the splitting field of a polynomial with Galois group $S_5$. The only quadratic subfield of $K_2$ is the one corresponding to the normal subgroup $A_5$, which is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{D})$, where $D$ is the discriminant of $f_2(x)$.\nThe discriminant of $x^n+ax+b$ is $D = (-1)^{n(n-1)/2}(n^n b^{n-1} + (-1)^{n-1}(n-1)^{n-1}a^n)$. For $f_2(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$, we have $n=5, a=-9, b=3$.\n$D = (-1)^{10} [5^5 \\cdot 3^{5-1} + (-1)^4 (4)^4 (-9)^5] = 5^5 \\cdot 3^4 + 4^4 (-9)^5 = 3^4(5^5 + 4^4(-9)^3) = 81(3125 + 256(-729)) = 81(3125-186624)=81(-183499)$.\nThe quadratic subfield of $K_2$ is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{D}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-183499})$.\n$K_1=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. For $K_1 \\cap K_2 \\neq \\mathbb{Q}$, we would need $K_1=K_2$'s quadratic subfield, so $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-183499})$. This is not true as one field is real and the other is complex.\nTherefore, $K_1 \\cap K_2 = \\mathbb{Q}$, and the Galois group is the direct product:\n$G = Gal(K/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong Gal(K_1/\\mathbb{Q}) \\times Gal(K_2/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong C_2 \\times S_5$.\nThe order of the group is $|G|=2 \\cdot 120 = 240$, so $[K:\\mathbb{Q}]=240$.\n\n**Step 4: Find the possible degrees of normal intermediate extensions**\nAn intermediate field $L$ with $\\mathbb{Q} \\subsetneq L \\subsetneq K$ is a normal extension over $\\mathbb{Q}$ if and only if its corresponding Galois group, $H = Gal(K/L)$, is a normal subgroup of $G = Gal(K/\\mathbb{Q})$. The condition $\\mathbb{Q} \\subsetneq L \\subsetneq K$ implies that $H$ must be a proper non-trivial subgroup, i.e., $H \\neq \\{e\\}$ and $H \\neq G$. The degree of the extension is $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = [G:H] = |G|/|H|$.\n\nWe need to find all proper, non-trivial normal subgroups of $G = C_2 \\times S_5$. The normal subgroups of $C_2$ are $\\{1\\}$ and $C_2$. The normal subgroups of $S_5$ are $\\{e\\}$, $A_5$, and $S_5$.\nThe normal subgroups of a direct product $G_1 \\times G_2$ are not always products of normal subgroups of $G_1$ and $G_2$. There can be \"diagonal\" subgroups when there is a common quotient group. Here, $C_2$ and $S_5$ share a common quotient $C_2 \\cong S_5/A_5$.\n\nThe normal subgroups of $C_2 \\times S_5$ are:\n1.  **Product subgroups:** $N_1 \\times N_2$, where $N_1 \\vartriangleleft C_2$ and $N_2 \\vartriangleleft S_5$.\n    *   $C_2 \\times S_5$ (corresponds to $L=\\mathbb{Q}$, so $H$ is not proper)\n    *   $C_2 \\times A_5$ (proper, non-trivial). $|H|=2 \\cdot 60 = 120$. Index: $240/120 = 2$.\n    *   $C_2 \\times \\{e\\}$ (proper, non-trivial). $|H|=2 \\cdot 1 = 2$. Index: $240/2 = 120$.\n    *   $\\{1\\} \\times S_5$ (proper, non-trivial). $|H|=1 \\cdot 120 = 120$. Index: $240/120 = 2$.\n    *   $\\{1\\} \\times A_5$ (proper, non-trivial). $|H|=1 \\cdot 60 = 60$. Index: $240/60 = 4$.\n    *   $\\{1\\} \\times \\{e\\}$ (corresponds to $L=K$, so $H$ is not non-trivial)\n2.  **Diagonal subgroups:** These arise from isomorphisms between quotients. The only non-trivial case is from the isomorphism $\\phi: S_5/A_5 \\to C_2$. This gives rise to one more normal subgroup:\n    *   $H_{diag} = \\{ (c, s) \\in C_2 \\times S_5 \\mid \\phi(sA_5) = c \\}$. If we represent $C_2$ as $\\{\\pm 1\\}$, this is $H_{diag} = \\{(\\text{sgn}(s), s) \\mid s \\in S_5 \\}$. The order is $|H_{diag}|=|S_5|=120$. This is a proper non-trivial normal subgroup. Index: $240/120 = 2$.\n\n**Step 5: List the degrees**\nThe possible degrees of the normal intermediate fields are the indices of these subgroups.\n*   From $C_2 \\times A_5$, degree = 2.\n*   From $C_2 \\times \\{e\\}$, degree = 120.\n*   From $\\{1\\} \\times S_5$, degree = 2.\n*   From $\\{1\\} \\times A_5$, degree = 4.\n*   From $H_{diag}$, degree = 2.\n\nThe set of all possible distinct degrees is $\\{2, 4, 120\\}$."
