    "Answering this question requires a careful interpretation of the term \"power subgroup\" and a detailed analysis of the structure of the semidihedral group.\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Semidihedral Group $SD_{512}$**\n\nThe semidihedral group of order $512 = 2^9$ is denoted by $SD_{512}$ or $SD_{2^9}$. It is a non-abelian 2-group. Its standard presentation is:\n$G = SD_{2^9} = \\langle r, s \\mid r^{2^{9-1}} = s^2 = 1, srs = r^{2^{9-2}-1} \\rangle$\n$G = \\langle r, s \\mid r^{256} = s^2 = 1, srs = r^{127} \\rangle$\nThe order of the group is $|G| = 512$. The group consists of $256$ elements of the form $r^i$ (which form a cyclic subgroup $\\langle r \\rangle \\cong C_{256}$) and $256$ elements of the form $sr^i$.\n\n**Step 2: Interpreting \"Power Subgroups\"**\n\nThe term \"power subgroup\" is not standard in group theory literature. We must consider the most plausible interpretations. A \"power subgroup\" could refer to:\n1.  Subgroups formed by taking powers of all elements of $G$, i.e., subgroups of the form $G^k = \\langle g^k \\mid g \\in G \\rangle$. Given the group is a 2-group, the most natural powers to consider are $k=2^j$ for $j \\ge 0$.\n2.  The subgroups appearing in the lower p-series (or lower power series) of $G$. For a 2-group, this series is defined as $P_0(G) = G$ and $P_{i+1}(G) = (P_i(G))^2[P_i(G), G]$.\n3.  The subgroups appearing in the lower central series of $G$, defined by $\\gamma_1(G)=G$ and $\\gamma_{i+1}(G) = [\\gamma_i(G), G]$.\n4.  The set of all Frattini subgroups of subgroups of $G$, i.e., $\\{ \\Phi(K) \\mid K \\le G \\}$.\n\nInterpretations 1, 2, and 3 are closely related and defined directly from the group $G$, which fits the phrasing \"power subgroups in the group\". Let's analyze interpretation (1). We will see that all three lead to the same answer.\n\n**Step 3: Calculating the Subgroups $G^{2^j}$**\n\nWe will compute the distinct subgroups in the sequence $G^{2^0}, G^{2^1}, G^{2^2}, \\dots$.\n*   For $j=0$: $G^{2^0} = G^1 = \\langle g^1 \\mid g \\in G \\rangle = G$. This is the group itself.\n\n*   For $j=1$: $G^{2^1} = G^2 = \\langle g^2 \\mid g \\in G \\rangle$. We must find the squares of all elements in $G$.\n    *   If $g = r^i$, then $g^2 = (r^i)^2 = r^{2i}$. These elements generate the cyclic subgroup $\\langle r^2 \\rangle$.\n    *   If $g = sr^i$, we use the relation $sr = r^{127}s$ to find $sr^i = r^{127i}s$. Then $g^2 = (sr^i)^2 = sr^i sr^i = s(r^i s)r^i = s(s r^{127i})r^i = r^{127i}r^i = r^{128i}$. These elements generate the subgroup $\\langle r^{128} \\rangle$.\n    *   Combining these, $G^2 = \\langle \\langle r^2 \\rangle, \\langle r^{128} \\rangle \\rangle = \\langle r^2, r^{128} \\rangle$. Since $r^{128} = (r^2)^{64}$, this is simply $\\langle r^2 \\rangle$.\n\n*   For $j=2$: $G^{2^2} = G^4 = \\langle g^4 \\mid g \\in G \\rangle$.\n    *   If $g = r^i$, then $g^4 = r^{4i}$. These generate $\\langle r^4 \\rangle$.\n    *   If $g = sr^i$, then $g^4 = ((sr^i)^2)^2 = (r^{128i})^2 = r^{256i} = 1$. These generate the trivial subgroup $\\{1\\}$.\n    *   Thus, $G^4 = \\langle \\langle r^4 \\rangle, \\{1\\} \\rangle = \\langle r^4 \\rangle$.\n\n*   For a general $j \\ge 1$: $G^{2^j} = \\langle g^{2^j} \\mid g \\in G \\rangle$.\n    *   If $g = r^i$, $g^{2^j} = r^{i 2^j}$, generating $\\langle r^{2^j} \\rangle$.\n    *   If $g = sr^i$, $g^{2^j} = ((sr^i)^2)^{2^{j-1}} = (r^{128i})^{2^{j-1}} = r^{i \\cdot 128 \\cdot 2^{j-1}} = r^{i \\cdot 2^7 \\cdot 2^{j-1}} = r^{i \\cdot 2^{j+6}}$. These generate $\\langle r^{2^{j+6}} \\rangle$.\n    *   So, $G^{2^j} = \\langle r^{2^j}, r^{2^{j+6}} \\rangle = \\langle r^{\\gcd(2^j, 2^{j+6})} \\rangle = \\langle r^{2^j} \\rangle$.\n\n**Step 4: Counting the Distinct Subgroups**\n\nThe sequence of power subgroups under this interpretation is:\n*   $G^{2^0} = G$\n*   $G^{2^1} = \\langle r^2 \\rangle \\cong C_{128}$\n*   $G^{2^2} = \\langle r^4 \\rangle \\cong C_{64}$\n*   $G^{2^3} = \\langle r^8 \\rangle \\cong C_{32}$\n*   $G^{2^4} = \\langle r^{16} \\rangle \\cong C_{16}$\n*   $G^{2^5} = \\langle r^{32} \\rangle \\cong C_8$\n*   $G^{2^6} = \\langle r^{64} \\rangle \\cong C_4$\n*   $G^{2^7} = \\langle r^{128} \\rangle \\cong C_2$\n*   $G^{2^8} = \\langle r^{256} \\rangle = \\{1\\}$ (the trivial subgroup, as $o(r)=256$)\n\nFor any $j>8$, $G^{2^j}$ will also be the trivial subgroup.\nThe group $G$ is non-cyclic, so it is distinct from all the others. The cyclic subgroups $\\langle r^{2^j} \\rangle$ are all distinct for $j=1, \\dots, 8$ because they have different orders.\nSo, the distinct subgroups in this sequence are:\n$G, \\langle r^2 \\rangle, \\langle r^4 \\rangle, \\langle r^8 \\rangle, \\langle r^{16} \\rangle, \\langle r^{32} \\rangle, \\langle r^{64} \\rangle, \\langle r^{128} \\rangle, \\{1\\}$.\nCounting these subgroups, we have 1 (for $G$) + 7 (for non-trivial cyclic subgroups) + 1 (for the trivial subgroup) = 9 subgroups.\n\n**Step 5: Confirmation with other interpretations**\nAnalyzing the lower p-series and the lower central series for $SD_{512}$ reveals that they both generate this exact same set of 9 subgroups. This strong agreement across different standard group constructions makes it highly probable that this is the intended answer. The set of Frattini subgroups of subgroups gives a count of 8 (it excludes $G$ itself), which seems less likely given the agreement of the other methods.\n\nTherefore, there are 9 power subgroups in the semidihedral group of size 512.\n\n<<<9>>>"
