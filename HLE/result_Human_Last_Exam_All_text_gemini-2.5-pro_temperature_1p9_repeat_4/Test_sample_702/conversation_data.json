    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the connectivity of the map $f: \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the source and target spaces.**\n\nLet the source space be $X = \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$ and the target space be $Y = \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$.\n\n*   **Target Space ($Y$)**:\n    The smash product $S^4 \\wedge S^6$ is homeomorphic to the sphere $S^{10}$.\n    Therefore, the target space is $Y = \\Omega S^{10}$.\n    The homotopy groups of a loop space are given by $\\pi_k(\\Omega Z) = \\pi_{k+1}(Z)$.\n    So, $\\pi_k(Y) = \\pi_k(\\Omega S^{10}) = \\pi_{k+1}(S^{10})$.\n    The sphere $S^{10}$ is 9-connected, meaning $\\pi_i(S^{10}) = 0$ for $i \\leq 9$.\n    The homotopy groups of $Y=\\Omega S^{10}$ are:\n    $\\pi_k(\\Omega S^{10}) = 0$ for $k+1 < 10$, which means $k < 9$.\n    For $k=9$, $\\pi_9(\\Omega S^{10}) = \\pi_{10}(S^{10}) = \\mathbb{Z}$.\n    A space is $n$-connected if its homotopy groups $\\pi_i$ are trivial for all $i \\leq n$.\n    Since $\\pi_k(\\Omega S^{10})$ is trivial for $k \\le 8$ but non-trivial for $k=9$, the target space $Y = \\Omega S^{10}$ is **8-connected**.\n\n*   **Source Space ($X$)**:\n    We need to determine the connectivity of $X = \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$.\n    First, let's analyze the connectivity of the loop spaces $\\Omega S^4$ and $\\Omega S^6$.\n    *   For $\\Omega S^4$: $\\pi_k(\\Omega S^4) = \\pi_{k+1}(S^4)$. This is zero for $k+1 < 4$, i.e., $k<3$. Thus $\\Omega S^4$ is 2-connected.\n    *   For $\\Omega S^6$: $\\pi_k(\\Omega S^6) = \\pi_{k+1}(S^6)$. This is zero for $k+1 < 6$, i.e., $k<5$. Thus $\\Omega S^6$ is 4-connected.\n\n    Next, we use the fact that if $A$ is $p$-connected and $B$ is $q$-connected, their smash product $A \\wedge B$ is $(p+q+1)$-connected.\n    So, $\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6$ is $(2+4+1) = 7$-connected.\n\n    Finally, the suspension $\\Sigma Z$ of a $k$-connected space $Z$ is $(k+1)$-connected.\n    Therefore, $X = \\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$ is $(7+1) = \\mathbf{8}$-connected.\n\n**Careful Point 1**: One might be tempted to use the homotopy equivalence $\\Sigma \\Omega S^n \\simeq S^n$. This allows showing $\\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\simeq S^4 \\wedge S^6 = S^{10}$. A space being 8-connected and having the homotopy type of $S^{10}$ (which is 9-connected) is not contradictory. My connectivity calculation is the more precise one. Let's re-verify the equivalence $\\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\simeq S^{10}$. A result by G.W. Whitehead states that the evaluation map induces an isomorphism $\\pi_k(\\Sigma(\\Omega A \\wedge \\Omega B)) \\to \\pi_k(A \\wedge B)$ for $k$ in a very large range, implying a homotopy equivalence for many cells. Thus, $\\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$ is indeed homotopy equivalent to $S^{10}$, which is 9-connected.\nLet's redo the connectivity of the source using this fact.\n*   The source space $X = \\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\simeq S^{10}$.\n*   The space $S^{10}$ is 9-connected.\n\nSo, we have a map $f: (\\text{9-connected space}) \\to (\\text{8-connected space})$.\n\n**Step 2: Define the map and its properties.**\n\nThe map $f: \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$ is standard in homotopy theory. It is constructed from the commutator map on loop spaces and is related to the Samelson product, which is adjoint to the Whitehead product. This map is known to be non-trivial.\nUsing the equivalence $X \\simeq S^{10}$, the map can be viewed as a map $f': S^{10} \\to \\Omega S^{10}$.\nSuch a map represents an element in the homotopy group $\\pi_{10}(\\Omega S^{10}) = \\pi_{11}(S^{10})$.\nFrom the calculation of stable homotopy groups of spheres, we know that $\\pi_{11}(S^{10}) = \\pi_1^S = \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\nSince the map induced from the commutator/Whitehead product is non-trivial, $f'$ must represent the non-zero element of $\\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the connectivity of the map.**\n\nThe connectivity of a map $g: A \\to B$ is the largest integer $n$ such that the induced map on homotopy groups, $g_*: \\pi_k(A) \\to \\pi_k(B)$, is an isomorphism for all $k < n$ and an epimorphism (surjection) for $k=n$.\n\nWe are analyzing the map $f': S^{10} \\to \\Omega S^{10}$ which represents the generator of $\\pi_{11}(S^{10})$.\n\n*   **For $k < 9$**:\n    $\\pi_k(S^{10}) = 0$ and $\\pi_k(\\Omega S^{10}) = 0$. The map $0 \\to 0$ is an isomorphism.\n\n*   **For $k = 9$**:\n    $f'_*: \\pi_9(S^{10}) \\to \\pi_9(\\Omega S^{10})$.\n    This is a map from $\\pi_9(S^{10})=0$ to $\\pi_9(\\Omega S^{10})=\\mathbb{Z}$. The only such map is the zero map.\n    A map $0 \\to \\mathbb{Z}$ is not surjective (an epimorphism).\n\n*   **Conclusion on connectivity**:\n    The condition for $f'$ being 9-connected fails because the map on $\\pi_9$ is not surjective. Therefore, the connectivity must be less than 9.\n    Let's check for 8-connectivity.\n    *   Is $f'_*$ an isomorphism for $k<8$? Yes, it's a map between trivial groups.\n    *   Is $f'_*$ an epimorphism for $k=8$? Yes, the map $f'_{*,8}: \\pi_8(S^{10}) \\to \\pi_8(\\Omega S^{10})$ is a map $0 \\to 0$, which is an epimorphism.\n\nTherefore, the connectivity of the map is 8.\n\n**Final careful check**: The steps rely on identifying the map with a non-trivial element of $\\pi_{10}(\\Omega S^{10})$. This identification is standard. The core of the argument is that the source space is higher-connected than the target space, and the first non-trivial homotopy group of the target space, $\\pi_9(\\Omega S^{10})$, cannot be hit by the image of the corresponding homotopy group of the source, $\\pi_9(S^{10})$, because the latter is trivial. This immediately limits the connectivity.\n\nFinal analysis:\n- Source space: $X \\simeq S^{10}$ (9-connected).\n- Target space: $Y \\simeq \\Omega S^{10}$ (8-connected).\n- Map $f: X \\to Y$ is non-trivial.\n- Test connectivity:\n  - $k < 8$: $\\pi_k(X) = 0, \\pi_k(Y)=0$. $f_k$ is iso.\n  - $k=8$: $\\pi_8(X)=0, \\pi_8(Y)=0$. $f_8$ is epi.\n  - $k=9$: $\\pi_9(X)=0, \\pi_9(Y)=\\mathbb{Z}$. $f_9: 0 \\to \\mathbb{Z}$ is not epi.\n- The highest value $n$ for which the condition holds is $n=8$.\n\n>>> 8"
