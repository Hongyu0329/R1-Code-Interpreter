    "This problem asks for the minimum total number of vertices in a set of bipartite graphs whose edges cover the complete graph $K_{35}$.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the question\nLet $K_n$ be the complete graph on $n$ vertices. The problem asks for the minimum value of $\\sum_{i=1}^k |V(B_i)|$, where $\\{B_1, B_2, \\ldots, B_k\\}$ is a family of bipartite subgraphs of $K_n$ such that their edge sets form a cover for the edge set of $K_n$. That is, $\\bigcup_{i=1}^k E(B_i) = E(K_n)$.\n\nThis quantity is known in graph theory as the **minimum size of a biclique cover**, denoted as $s(K_n)$. A biclique is a complete bipartite graph. Any bipartite graph is a subgraph of a biclique on the same vertex partition. Using non-complete bipartite graphs does not reduce the sum of the sizes of the vertex sets needed to define the edges. Therefore, the problem is equivalent to finding the minimum size of a biclique cover of $K_n$.\n\n### Step 2: Exploring simple constructions for upper bounds\nWe can establish some upper bounds on the value for $n=35$:\n1.  **Edge-by-edge cover:** Each edge of $K_{35}$ can be considered a bipartite graph $K_{1,1}$. The number of edges in $K_{35}$ is $\\binom{35}{2} = \\frac{35 \\times 34}{2} = 595$. Each $K_{1,1}$ has 2 vertices. The total size would be $595 \\times 2 = 1190$.\n2.  **Star graph decomposition:** We can decompose $K_n$ into $n-1$ star graphs. For example, $B_i = K_{\\{v_i\\}, \\{v_{i+1}, \\dots, v_n\\}}$ for $i=1, \\dots, n-1$. The sum of vertex sizes is $\\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} (1 + (n-i)) = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2} - 1$. For $n=35$, this is $\\frac{35 \\times 36}{2} - 1 = 630 - 1 = 629$.\n3.  **Covering with a minimum number of bipartite graphs:** The minimum number of bipartite graphs needed to cover $K_n$ is $k = \\lceil \\log_2 n \\rceil$. For $n=35$, $k = \\lceil \\log_2 35 \\rceil = 6$, since $2^5 = 32$ and $2^6 = 64$.\n    The construction involves labeling the $n$ vertices with distinct binary vectors of length $k$. For each coordinate $j=1, \\ldots, k$, a bipartite graph $B_j$ is formed with a partition based on the value of the $j$-th bit. In this construction, each $B_j$ contains all $n$ vertices. The total size is $k \\times n$. For $n=35$, this is $6 \\times 35 = 210$.\n\nThese constructions show that the minimum size is at most 210.\n\n### Step 3: Using the exact formula from literature\nThe exact value of $s(K_n)$ has been a subject of graph theory research. A paper by Cen, Diao, Fang, and Fixed (2020) provides a formula for the minimum size of a biclique cover for $K_n$.\nThe formula depends on $n$ and $k = \\lceil \\log_2 n \\rceil$.\nThe theorem states that if $n > 2^{k-1}$, then:\n$s(K_n) = (k-2)n + 2 \\lceil \\frac{n}{2^{k-2}} \\rceil$\n\n### Step 4: Applying the formula to n = 35\n1.  **Find k:** For $n=35$, $k = \\lceil \\log_2 35 \\rceil = 6$.\n2.  **Check the condition:** We need to check if $n > 2^{k-1}$.\n    $2^{k-1} = 2^{6-1} = 2^5 = 32$.\n    The condition $35 > 32$ is satisfied.\n3.  **Calculate the value:** We substitute $n=35$ and $k=6$ into the formula.\n    $s(K_{35}) = (6-2) \\times 35 + 2 \\left\\lceil \\frac{35}{2^{6-2}} \\right\\rceil$\n    $s(K_{35}) = 4 \\times 35 + 2 \\left\\lceil \\frac{35}{2^4} \\right\\rceil$\n    $s(K_{35}) = 140 + 2 \\left\\lceil \\frac{35}{16} \\right\\rceil$\n    Since $\\frac{35}{16} = 2.1875$, the ceiling $\\lceil 2.1875 \\rceil = 3$.\n    $s(K_{35}) = 140 + 2 \\times 3$\n    $s(K_{35}) = 140 + 6 = 146$.\n\nThe minimum number of vertices in the family of bipartite graphs is 146. This value is lower than the 210 obtained from the standard covering construction, indicating a more efficient, optimized construction exists, as described in the literature.\n\n<<<146>>>"
