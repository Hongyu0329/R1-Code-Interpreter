The proposed filtering strategy is to first create a reference list of genes known to be highly expressed in the contaminating cancer cell line. After performing differential expression analysis comparing the CAR-IL15 group against the CAR-only group (as the reference), you filter the resulting gene list based on a dual criterion: 1) the gene must be present in your pre-defined cancer gene reference list, and 2) the gene must exhibit a strong negative log2 fold change, such as less than -2. This negative L2FC indicates that the gene's expression is significantly higher in the contaminated CAR-only samples than in the cleaner CAR-IL15 samples, thus effectively identifying and removing the cancer cell contaminants.
