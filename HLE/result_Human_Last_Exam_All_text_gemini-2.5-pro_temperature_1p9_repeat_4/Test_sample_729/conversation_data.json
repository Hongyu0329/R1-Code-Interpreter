    "Answering the question \"How many power subgroups are there in the generalized quaternion group of size 128?\" requires a step-by-step analysis of the group's structure and the definition of a power subgroup.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Generalized Quaternion Group Q_128**\n\nThe generalized quaternion group of order 128, denoted as `Q_128`, has the following presentation:\n`G = Q_128 = <x, y | x^64 = 1, y^2 = x^32, yxy^(-1) = x^(-1)>`\n\nLet's establish key properties of this group:\n*   **Order:** The group `G` has 128 elements.\n*   **Elements:** Any element `g` in `G` can be uniquely written as `g = x^i` or `g = x^i y` for `0 <= i < 64`.\n*   **Subgroup `<x>`:** The element `x` generates a cyclic subgroup `<x>` of order 64.\n*   **Powers of `y`:** `y^2 = x^32`, and `y^4 = (x^32)^2 = x^64 = 1`. So, `y` has order 4.\n*   **Center of G:** The center `Z(G)` consists of elements that commute with all elements in `G`. For `Q_{4n}`, the center is `<x^n>`. Here `4n=128`, so `n=32`. The center is `Z(G) = <x^32> = {1, x^32}`.\n*   **Powers of elements of the form `x^i y`:** Let `g = x^i y`. Its square is `g^2 = (x^i y)(x^i y) = x^i(yx^iy^{-1})y^2 = x^i(x^{-i})y^2 = y^2 = x^32`. Thus, `(x^i y)^2 = x^32`, which is a central element of order 2. This means all elements not in `<x>` have order 4, since `(x^i y)^4 = (x^32)^2 = 1`.\n\n**Step 2: Understand Power Subgroups**\n\nA subgroup `H` of `G` is a \"power subgroup\" if there exists an integer `m` such that `H` is the set of all `m`-th powers of elements of `G`. That is, `H = G^m = {g^m | g in G}`. We need to find the number of distinct subgroups that can be formed in this way.\n\n**Step 3: Compute the sets G^m**\n\nWe can compute `G^m` by considering the powers of the two types of elements in `G`. The outcome depends on whether `m` is even or odd.\n\n**Case A: `m` is an odd integer.**\n\nLet `m = 2k + 1` for some integer `k`.\n1.  **Powers of `x^i`:** For an element `g = x^i` in `<x>`, its `m`-th power is `g^m = (x^i)^m = x^{im}`. Since `m` is odd, `gcd(m, 64) = 1`. As `i` runs from 0 to 63, the product `im` (mod 64) also covers all values from 0 to 63. Therefore, the set of `m`-th powers of elements in `<x>` is `<x>` itself.\n2.  **Powers of `x^i y`:** For an element `g = x^i y`, its `m`-th power is `g^m = (x^i y)^{2k+1} = ((x^i y)^2)^k * (x^i y)`. From Step 1, we know `(x^i y)^2 = x^{32}`. So, `g^m = (x^{32})^k * (x^i y) = x^{32k}x^iy`. Since `x^{32}` is central, this simplifies to `g^m = x^{i+32k}y`. As `i` runs from 0 to 63, `i+32k` (mod 64) also covers all values from 0 to 63. Thus, the set of `m`-th powers of elements of the form `x^i y` is the entire coset `<x>y`.\n3.  **Result for odd `m`:** Combining these results, `G^m = <x> U <x>y = G`. So, for any odd integer `m`, the resulting power subgroup is the group `G` itself. This gives us **1** power subgroup.\n\n**Case B: `m` is an even integer.**\n\nLet `m = 2k` for some integer `k`.\n1.  **Powers of `x^i`:** For `g = x^i`, `g^m = x^{im}`. The set `{x^{im} | 0 <= i < 64}` generates the cyclic subgroup `<x^{gcd(m, 64)}>`.\n2.  **Powers of `x^i y`:** For `g = x^i y`, `g^m = (x^i y)^{2k} = ((x^i y)^2)^k = (x^{32})^k = x^{32k}`.\n3.  **Result for even `m`:** `G^m` is the union of `<x^{gcd(m, 64)}>` and the element `x^{32k}`. We need to check if `x^{32k}` is already in `<x^{gcd(m, 64)}>`. This is equivalent to checking if `gcd(m, 64)` divides `32k`.\n    Since `m=2k`, we need to check if `gcd(2k, 64)` divides `32k = 16 * (2k)`. This is always true because `gcd(2k, 64)` must be a divisor of `2k`, and thus a divisor of any multiple of `2k`.\n    So, for any even integer `m`, `G^m = <x^{gcd(m, 64)}>`.\n\n**Step 4: Count the distinct power subgroups**\n\nNow we count the unique subgroups we found.\n1.  From odd `m`, we get one subgroup: `G`.\n2.  From even `m`, we get subgroups of the form `<x^d>` where `d = gcd(m, 64)` for some even `m`.\n    *   Since `m` is even, `d=gcd(m,64)` must also be an even number.\n    *   The divisors of 64 are {1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64}.\n    *   The even divisors of 64 are {2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64}. There are 6 such divisors.\n    *   Each of these even divisors `d` gives a distinct power subgroup `<x^d>`:\n        *   `d=2`: `<x^2>` (e.g., for `m=2`), order 32.\n        *   `d=4`: `<x^4>` (e.g., for `m=4`), order 16.\n        *   `d=8`: `<x^8>` (e.g., for `m=8`), order 8.\n        *   `d=16`: `<x^{16}>` (e.g., for `m=16`), order 4.\n        *   `d=32`: `<x^{32}>` (e.g., for `m=32`), order 2. This is the center `Z(G)`.\n        *   `d=64`: `<x^{64}>` (e.g., for `m=64`), which is the trivial subgroup `{1}`.\n    This gives us **6** distinct power subgroups.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIn total, the set of all power subgroups of `Q_128` is:\n`{ Q_128, <x^2>, <x^4>, <x^8>, <x^{16}>, <x^{32}>, {1} }`\n\nCounting these distinct subgroups, we have 1 (from the odd `m` case) + 6 (from the even `m` case) = 7.\n\nThere are 7 power subgroups in the generalized quaternion group of size 128.\n\n<<<7>>>"
