The approach is not valid. The primary reason is that the ecological function of mimicry is to deter predators, meaning the mimicry signal must be effective from the perspective of the predator's sensory system, not a human's. The visual systems of key bumblebee predators, such as birds, are significantly different from humans; notably, they can perceive ultraviolet (UV) light, which humans cannot. Bumblebees have UV color patterns that are crucial to their appearance to predators. Therefore, two species that appear similar to a human may look very different to a bird, and vice versa. Using untrained humans to rate similarity ignores the actual selective agent (the predator) and their specific perceptual abilities, rendering the resulting clusters ecologically meaningless.
