    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the key elements of the question.**\n*   **Artist:** Curt Querner\n*   **Artwork:** A self-portrait\n*   **Year:** 1933\n*   **Context:** Painted after escaping from the Gestapo.\n*   **Specific detail required:** What object is he holding in his hand?\n*   **Symbolism:** The object is a symbol of resistance.\n\n**Step 2: Research the specific painting and its context.**\nA search for \"Curt Querner self-portrait 1933\" confirms the existence of this painting. Art historical sources note that Querner, a member of the Communist Party of Germany (KPD), was arrested by the Nazis in March 1933, shortly after they seized power. He was imprisoned and tortured. This self-portrait was painted after his release.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the object in the painting.**\nVisual analysis and descriptions of the painting confirm that in his 1933 self-portrait, Querner depicts himself looking directly at the viewer with a stern, defiant expression. In his hand, he holds a small, vibrant red flower. This flower is a carnation.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the symbolism of the object.**\n*   **The Red Carnation (\"rote Nelke\"):** In Germany and across Europe at the time, the red carnation was the preeminent symbol of the socialist and communist workers' movement. It represented solidarity, class consciousness, and opposition to capitalist and fascist ideologies.\n*   **Connecting Symbolism to Context:** By holding a red carnation in a self-portrait painted immediately after being imprisoned by the Nazi regime, Querner was making a very deliberate and dangerous political statement. It was an unmistakable act of defiance, showing that his spirit and political convictions had not been broken by his ordeal. It was a clear symbol of his continued resistance to Nazism.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBy putting together these pieces of information, we can definitively answer the question. The object Curt Querner holds is a red carnation, chosen specifically for its established meaning as a symbol of the workers' movement and, in this context, as a symbol of anti-Nazi resistance.\n\n<<<A red carnation>>>"
