    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the scaling exponent $\\alpha$ for the specific heat.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Framework - Renormalization Group and Epsilon Expansion**\n\nThe problem asks for a critical exponent, $\\alpha$, within the framework of the Renormalization Group (RG) theory, using a specific calculational tool called the epsilon expansion.\n\n*   **Critical Exponents:** These numbers describe how physical quantities behave near a continuous phase transition. The specific heat, $C$, is expected to diverge as $C \\sim |t|^{-\\alpha}$ where $t = (T-T_c)/T_c$ is the reduced temperature.\n*   **Upper Critical Dimension ($d_c$):** This is the spatial dimension above which the critical exponents take on their simple \"mean-field theory\" values. For a large class of systems, including the Ising and general O(n) models, the upper critical dimension is $d_c=4$.\n*   **Epsilon Expansion ($\\epsilon$-expansion):** This is a technique pioneered by Kenneth Wilson and Michael Fisher to calculate critical exponents for dimensions $d$ below $d_c$. It treats the deviation from the upper critical dimension, $\\epsilon = d_c - d$, as a small parameter and computes the exponents as a power series in $\\epsilon$.\n\n**Step 2: Define the Parameters for the Problem**\n\n*   **Spatial Dimension:** The problem specifies the dimension $d=3$.\n*   **Upper Critical Dimension:** For the relevant class of models (O(n) universality class), $d_c=4$.\n*   **Expansion Parameter:** The value of epsilon is therefore $\\epsilon = d_c - d = 4 - 3 = 1$.\n\n**Careful Point:** The epsilon expansion works best for $\\epsilon \\ll 1$. For our case, $\\epsilon=1$, so we are using the expansion outside its rigorous domain of validity. However, it often gives surprisingly good qualitative and even semi-quantitative results. The calculation to the first order in $\\epsilon$ is a standard theoretical benchmark.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Relevant Physical Laws (Hyperscaling Relation)**\n\nIn RG theory, the critical exponents are not all independent. They are connected by scaling and hyperscaling relations. The exponent $\\alpha$ is related to the correlation length exponent, $\\nu$, by the Josephon's hyperscaling relation:\n$\\alpha = 2 - d\\nu$\n\nHere, $\\nu$ describes the divergence of the correlation length $\\xi$ as $\\xi \\sim |t|^{-\\nu}$. To find $\\alpha$, we first need to find the expression for $\\nu$ in the $\\epsilon$-expansion.\n\n**Step 4: The $\\epsilon$-Expansion for the Exponent $\\nu$**\n\nThe Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson Hamiltonian is used as the starting point for the RG calculation. The result for the exponent $\\nu$ for the O(n) model (which describes a system with an n-component order parameter) calculated to the first order in $\\epsilon$ is:\n\n$\\nu = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{n+2}{4(n+8)}\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n\n*   The term $1/2$ is the mean-field value of $\\nu$.\n*   The term proportional to $\\epsilon$ is the first-order correction due to fluctuations.\n\n**Careful Point:** The result depends on the symmetry of the order parameter, specified by `n`. For example:\n*   n=1: Ising model (e.g., uniaxial magnet, liquid-gas transition)\n*   n=2: XY model (e.g., superfluid helium)\n*   n=3: Heisenberg model (e.g., isotropic magnet)\n\nThe problem does not specify `n`. In such cases, the canonical example of the Ising model (n=1) is usually implied, as it is the simplest and most widely applicable model for scalar order parameters. We will proceed assuming n=1.\n\n**Step 5: Derive the Exponent $\\alpha$ using the $\\epsilon$-Expansion**\n\nNow we substitute the expression for $\\nu$ and $d = 4 - \\epsilon$ into the hyperscaling relation $\\alpha = 2 - d\\nu$. We must be careful to only keep terms up to the first order in $\\epsilon$.\n\n1.  Start with the relation:\n    $\\alpha = 2 - (4 - \\epsilon)\\nu$\n\n2.  Substitute the first-order expansion for $\\nu$:\n    $\\alpha = 2 - (4 - \\epsilon) \\left[ \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{n+2}{4(n+8)}\\epsilon \\right]$\n\n3.  Expand the product and keep terms up to $O(\\epsilon)$:\n    $\\alpha = 2 - \\left[ 4 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} + 4 \\cdot \\frac{n+2}{4(n+8)}\\epsilon - \\epsilon \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} + O(\\epsilon^2) \\right]$\n    $\\alpha = 2 - \\left[ 2 + \\frac{n+2}{n+8}\\epsilon - \\frac{1}{2}\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2) \\right]$\n\n4.  Simplify the expression:\n    $\\alpha = - \\frac{n+2}{n+8}\\epsilon + \\frac{1}{2}\\epsilon$\n    $\\alpha = \\left( \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{n+2}{n+8} \\right)\\epsilon$\n    $\\alpha = \\left( \\frac{n+8 - 2(n+2)}{2(n+8)} \\right)\\epsilon$\n    $\\alpha = \\left( \\frac{n+8 - 2n - 4}{2(n+8)} \\right)\\epsilon$\n    $\\alpha = \\frac{4-n}{2(n+8)}\\epsilon$\n\nThis is the general formula for $\\alpha$ to first order in $\\epsilon$ for an O(n) model.\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the Final Answer**\n\nWe now use the specific parameters for our problem:\n*   $d=3 \\implies \\epsilon = 1$\n*   Assume the Ising model universality class $\\implies n=1$\n\nSubstitute these values into the derived formula for $\\alpha$:\n$\\alpha = \\frac{4-1}{2(1+8)} \\times 1 = \\frac{3}{2 \\times 9} = \\frac{3}{18}$\n\n$\\alpha = \\frac{1}{6}$\n\nThe value of the specific heat exponent $\\alpha$ for a d=3 system, calculated to first order in the $\\epsilon$-expansion for the Ising universality class, is 1/6.\n\n<<<1/6>>>"
