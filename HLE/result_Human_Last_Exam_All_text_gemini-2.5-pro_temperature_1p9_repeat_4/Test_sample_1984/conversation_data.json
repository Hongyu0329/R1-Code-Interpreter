    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the solution.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Problem**\nWe are given an autonomous first-order ordinary differential equation:\n$$ x'(t) = -x^{3}(t) + 2x^{2}(t) - x(t) $$\nWe need to find the number of stable equilibrium points, which is denoted by $m$. After finding $m$, we need to compute the value of the expression $m - 2^{4048}$.\n\n**Step 2: Find the Equilibrium Points**\nEquilibrium points (or fixed points) are the constant solutions of the differential equation. They occur where the rate of change is zero, i.e., $x'(t) = 0$.\nLet $f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 - x$. We need to solve the equation $f(x) = 0$.\n$$ -x^3 + 2x^2 - x = 0 $$\nWe can factor out $-x$ from the expression:\n$$ -x(x^2 - 2x + 1) = 0 $$\nThe quadratic term $x^2 - 2x + 1$ is a perfect square, $(x-1)^2$. So the equation becomes:\n$$ -x(x-1)^2 = 0 $$\nThe roots of this equation are the values of $x$ that make the factors zero.\nSo, the equilibrium points are $x = 0$ and $x = 1$.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Stability of the Equilibrium Points**\nTo determine the stability of each equilibrium point, we can use either the first derivative test (linearization) or a phase line analysis.\n\n**Method 1: First Derivative Test**\nWe compute the derivative of $f(x)$, which is $f'(x)$.\n$$ f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 - x $$\n$$ f'(x) = -3x^2 + 4x - 1 $$\nNow we evaluate $f'(x)$ at each equilibrium point $x^*$:\n*   If $f'(x^*) < 0$, the equilibrium point is stable.\n*   If $f'(x^*) > 0$, the equilibrium point is unstable.\n*   If $f'(x^*) = 0$, the test is inconclusive.\n\nLet's test our equilibrium points:\n*   For $x^* = 0$:\n    $f'(0) = -3(0)^2 + 4(0) - 1 = -1$.\n    Since $f'(0) = -1 < 0$, the equilibrium point $x=0$ is **stable**.\n\n*   For $x^* = 1$:\n    $f'(1) = -3(1)^2 + 4(1) - 1 = -3 + 4 - 1 = 0$.\n    Since $f'(1) = 0$, this test is inconclusive for the equilibrium point $x=1$. We need to use another method for this point.\n\n**Method 2: Phase Line Analysis**\nThis method involves analyzing the sign of $f(x) = x'(t)$ in the intervals defined by the equilibrium points. The sign of $f(x)$ tells us whether the solution $x(t)$ is increasing or decreasing.\nOur function is $f(x) = -x(x-1)^2$. The term $(x-1)^2$ is always non-negative. Therefore, the sign of $f(x)$ is determined by the sign of $-x$.\n\n*   **Interval 1: $x < 0$**\n    Let's pick a test point like $x = -1$.\n    $f(-1) = -(-1)(-1-1)^2 = 1(-2)^2 = 4 > 0$.\n    Since $f(x) > 0$, $x(t)$ is increasing in this interval. Solutions move to the right ($\\rightarrow$).\n\n*   **Interval 2: $0 < x < 1$**\n    Let's pick a test point like $x = 0.5$.\n    $f(0.5) = -0.5(0.5-1)^2 = -0.5(-0.5)^2 = -0.125 < 0$.\n    Since $f(x) < 0$, $x(t)$ is decreasing in this interval. Solutions move to the left ($\\leftarrow$).\n\n*   **Interval 3: $x > 1$**\n    Let's pick a test point like $x = 2$.\n    $f(2) = -2(2-1)^2 = -2(1)^2 = -2 < 0$.\n    Since $f(x) < 0$, $x(t)$ is decreasing in this interval. Solutions move to the left ($\\leftarrow$).\n\nNow we can draw the phase line:\n`----( x < 0 )----( x = 0 )----( 0 < x < 1 )----( x = 1 )----( x > 1 )----`\n`------  >  ------( 0 )------  <  ---------( 1 )------  <  ------`\n\nLet's interpret the phase line for each equilibrium point:\n*   **At $x = 0$**: To the left, solutions increase towards 0. To the right, solutions decrease towards 0. `(-> 0 <-)`. This confirms that $x=0$ is a **stable** equilibrium point (a sink).\n*   **At $x = 1$**: To the left, solutions decrease away from 1. To the right, solutions decrease towards 1. `(<- 1 <-)`. This is a **semi-stable** equilibrium point. A semi-stable equilibrium is considered **unstable** because trajectories on one side move away from it.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Value of m**\nThe variable $m$ represents the number of stable equilibrium points. Based on our analysis, only $x=0$ is a stable equilibrium point. Therefore,\n$$ m = 1 $$\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Final Expression**\nThe question asks for the value of $m - 2^{4048}$.\nSubstituting the value of $m=1$ into the expression, we get:\n$$ 1 - 2^{4048} $$\n\n<<<1 - 2^{4048}>>>"
