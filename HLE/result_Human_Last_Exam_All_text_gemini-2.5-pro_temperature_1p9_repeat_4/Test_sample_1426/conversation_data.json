    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the lowest of the final three notes played by the first violin in Dvořák's Symphony No. 2.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Musical Piece:** The piece is Antonín Dvořák's Symphony No. 2 in B-flat major, Op. 4.\n2.  **Identify the Target Section:** We need to find the very end of the symphony, specifically the last notes played by the first violin section (Violino I). This will be in the final measure of the fourth movement, \"Allegro con fuoco\".\n3.  **Consult the Musical Score:** To find the notes, we must refer to the orchestral score. The score contains the individual parts for all instruments.\n4.  **Locate the First Violin Part:** In the score, we find the staff labeled \"Violino I\".\n5.  **Examine the Final Measure:** At the very end of the fourth movement, the entire orchestra concludes with a powerful, final chord. The first violins do not play a sequence of three separate notes but rather a single three-note chord played simultaneously. The instruction \"divisi\" (or \"div.\") indicates that the players in the section should divide to play these three different notes.\n6.  **Identify the Three Notes:** Looking at the notes written for the first violin on the treble clef staff in the final measure, we see a chord consisting of three notes stacked vertically. These notes, from top to bottom, are:\n    *   F5 (the F on the top space of the staff)\n    *   D5 (the D on the fourth line from the bottom)\n    *   B♭4 (the B-flat on the middle line of the staff, as indicated by the B-flat major key signature)\n7.  **Determine the Lowest Note:** We now compare the pitches of these three notes: B♭4, D5, and F5. In terms of frequency, the note positioned lowest on the staff is the lowest in pitch. In this case, B♭4 is the lowest of the three.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **\"Three notes\" refers to a chord:** The question might imply three sequential notes, but in this orchestral context, the final sound from a string section is often a sustained chord where the players are divided (*divisi*) to play multiple notes at once.\n*   **Key Signature:** The key signature of the movement is B-flat major, which has two flats (B♭ and E♭). It is crucial to apply this to the note on the B line to correctly identify it as B-flat, not B natural.\n*   **Octave Register:** The notes are B♭4, D5, and F5. B♭4 is the B-flat just above Middle C, making it unequivocally the lowest of the three notes in the chord.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe three notes the first violins play at the very end form a B-flat major chord. The lowest of these three notes is B-flat.\n\n<<<B-flat>>>"
