    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to calculate the state feedback gain matrix F.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\n\nThe objective is to find a state feedback gain matrix `F` such that the closed-loop system matrix `A_cl = A + BF` has its eigenvalues at `-1 + j` and `-1 - j`.\n\n**2. Define the System Matrices and the Gain Matrix**\n\nWe are given:\n*   State matrix `A = [[-1, 1], [1, 0]]`\n*   Input matrix `B = [[1, 2], [1, 0]]`\n\nThe state `x` is 2-dimensional (since A is 2x2) and the input `u` is 2-dimensional (since B has 2 columns). The state feedback gain matrix `F` must have dimensions (number of inputs) x (number of states), which is 2x2. Let's define `F` as:\n`F = [[f1, f2], [f3, f4]]`\n\n**3. Determine the Desired Characteristic Polynomial**\n\nThe desired eigenvalues for the closed-loop system are `λ1 = -1 + j` and `λ2 = -1 - j`. The characteristic polynomial is formed from these roots:\n`p(λ) = (λ - λ1)(λ - λ2)`\n`p(λ) = (λ - (-1 + j))(λ - (-1 - j))`\n`p(λ) = (λ + 1 - j)(λ + 1 + j)`\n`p(λ) = (λ + 1)^2 - j^2`\nSince `j^2 = -1`:\n`p(λ) = λ^2 + 2λ + 1 - (-1)`\n`p(λ) = λ^2 + 2λ + 2`\n\n**4. Determine the Actual Characteristic Polynomial of A_cl**\n\nFirst, we compute the closed-loop matrix `A_cl = A + BF`:\n`BF = [[1, 2], [1, 0]] * [[f1, f2], [f3, f4]] = [[f1 + 2f3, f2 + 2f4], [f1, f2]]`\n\n`A_cl = A + BF = [[-1, 1], [1, 0]] + [[f1 + 2f3, f2 + 2f4], [f1, f2]]`\n`A_cl = [[-1 + f1 + 2f3, 1 + f2 + 2f4], [1 + f1, f2]]`\n\nNow, we find the characteristic polynomial of `A_cl`. For a 2x2 matrix `M = [[a, b], [c, d]]`, the characteristic polynomial is `λ^2 - trace(M)λ + det(M)`.\n*   `trace(A_cl) = (-1 + f1 + 2f3) + f2 = f1 + f2 + 2f3 - 1`\n*   `det(A_cl) = (-1 + f1 + 2f3) * f2 - (1 + f2 + 2f4) * (1 + f1)`\n    `= -f2 + f1*f2 + 2*f2*f3 - (1 + f1 + f2 + f1*f2 + 2f4 + 2*f1*f4)`\n    `= -1 - f1 - 2*f2 + 2*f2*f3 - 2*f4 - 2*f1*f4`\n\nThe characteristic polynomial of `A_cl` is:\n`p_cl(λ) = λ^2 - (f1 + f2 + 2f3 - 1)λ + (-1 - f1 - 2*f2 + 2*f2*f3 - 2*f4 - 2*f1*f4)`\n\n**5. Equate Coefficients and Solve for F**\n\nWe match the coefficients of our actual polynomial `p_cl(λ)` with the desired polynomial `p(λ) = λ^2 + 2λ + 2`.\n\n*   **Coefficient of λ:**\n    `-(f1 + f2 + 2f3 - 1) = 2`\n    `f1 + f2 + 2f3 - 1 = -2`\n    `f1 + f2 + 2f3 = -1`  (Equation 1)\n\n*   **Constant term:**\n    `-1 - f1 - 2*f2 + 2*f2*f3 - 2*f4 - 2*f1*f4 = 2`\n    `f1 + 2*f2 - 2*f2*f3 + 2*f4 + 2*f1*f4 = -3`  (Equation 2)\n\nWe have a system of two equations with four unknowns (`f1, f2, f3, f4`). This means there are infinite solutions for `F`. We can find one valid solution by making a simplifying choice. Let's assume the second row of `F` is zero, i.e., `f3 = 0` and `f4 = 0`.\n\nThe equations simplify to:\n1.  `f1 + f2 = -1`\n2.  `f1 + 2*f2 = -3`\n\nNow we solve this 2x2 system. Subtract the first equation from the second:\n`(f1 + 2*f2) - (f1 + f2) = -3 - (-1)`\n`f2 = -2`\n\nSubstitute `f2 = -2` into the first simplified equation:\n`f1 + (-2) = -1`\n`f1 = 1`\n\nSo, we have found one possible solution for F: `f1 = 1`, `f2 = -2`, `f3 = 0`, `f4 = 0`.\n\n**6. Final Answer Formulation**\n\nThe state feedback gain matrix `F` is:\n`F = [[1, -2], [0, 0]]`\n\n**7. Verification (Optional but Recommended)**\n\nLet's check our result.\n`A_cl = A + BF = [[-1, 1], [1, 0]] + [[1, 2], [1, 0]] * [[1, -2], [0, 0]]`\n`A_cl = [[-1, 1], [1, 0]] + [[1, -2], [1, -2]] = [[0, -1], [2, -2]]`\nThe characteristic equation of this `A_cl` is `det(λI - A_cl) = 0`:\n`det([[λ, 1], [-2, λ + 2]]) = λ(λ + 2) - (1)(-2) = λ^2 + 2λ + 2 = 0`\nThe roots are `λ = [-2 ± sqrt(4 - 8)] / 2 = -1 ± j`.\nThe verification confirms our result is correct.\n\n<<<[[1, -2], [0, 0]]>>>"
