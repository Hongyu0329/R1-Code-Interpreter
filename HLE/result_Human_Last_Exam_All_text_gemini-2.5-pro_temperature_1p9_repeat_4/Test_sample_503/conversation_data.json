    "An internal adjunction in the 2-category $\\Delta$ from an object $[m]$ to an object $[n]$ is a pair of morphisms (non-decreasing maps) $L: [m] \\to [n]$ and $R: [n] \\to [m]$ that form a Galois connection between the posets $([m], \\leq)$ and $([n], \\leq)$.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the definitions**\n*   The objects of the simplex category $\\Delta$ are the finite totally ordered sets $[k] = \\{0, 1, \\ldots, k\\}$ for $k \\geq 0$.\n*   The morphisms $f: [m] \\to [n]$ in $\\Delta$ are non-decreasing functions.\n*   The category $\\Delta$ is viewed as a locally posetal 2-category. This means that for any two objects $[m], [n]$, the set of morphisms $\\mathrm{Hom}_{\\Delta}([m], [n])$ is itself a poset, where the order is given pointwise: $f \\leq g$ if and only if $f(i) \\leq g(i)$ for all $i \\in [m]$. A 2-morphism exists from $f$ to $g$ if and only if $f \\leq g$.\n*   An internal adjunction from $[m]$ to $[n]$ consists of a pair of morphisms $L: [m] \\to [n]$ and $R: [n] \\to [m]$ (called 1-morphisms), and two 2-morphisms, the unit $\\eta: \\mathrm{id}_{[m]} \\to R \\circ L$ and the counit $\\epsilon: L \\circ R \\to \\mathrm{id}_{[n]}$, satisfying the triangle identities.\n*   In this posetal context, the existence of the unit 2-morphism $\\eta$ translates to the inequality $\\mathrm{id}_{[m]} \\leq R \\circ L$, which means $i \\leq R(L(i))$ for all $i \\in [m]$.\n*   Similarly, the existence of the counit 2-morphism $\\epsilon$ translates to the inequality $L \\circ R \\leq \\mathrm{id}_{[n]}$, which means $L(R(j)) \\leq j$ for all $j \\in [n]$.\n*   These two conditions, $i \\leq R(L(i))$ and $L(R(j)) \\leq j$, define a Galois connection. It can be shown that they are equivalent to the single condition $L(i) \\leq j \\iff i \\leq R(j)$ for all $i \\in [m], j \\in [n]$.\n*   For a locally posetal 2-category, the triangle identities for an adjunction are automatically satisfied if the unit and counit conditions hold.\n\n**Step 2: Characterize the adjoint maps**\nAn adjunction is uniquely determined by either its left part $L$ or its right part $R$. We need to find the number of such pairs $(L, R)$. It is equivalent to counting the number of possible left adjoints $L$ or the number of possible right adjoints $R$.\n\n*   A non-decreasing map $L: [m] \\to [n]$ has a right adjoint if and only if for every $j \\in [n]$, the set $\\{i \\in [m] \\mid L(i) \\leq j\\}$ has a maximum element. Since $L$ is non-decreasing, this set is an initial segment of $[m]$, so it has a maximum if and only if it is non-empty. For this to hold for all $j \\in [n]$, it must hold for $j=0$. The existence of an $i \\in [m]$ with $L(i) \\leq 0$ implies $L(0)=0$ (as $L$ is non-decreasing and its values are non-negative). Conversely, if $L(0)=0$, then for any $j \\in [n]$, $L(0)=0 \\leq j$, so the set is non-empty. Therefore, a non-decreasing map $L: [m] \\to [n]$ is a left adjoint if and only if it preserves the minimum element, i.e., $L(0)=0$.\n\n*   Dually, a non-decreasing map $R: [n] \\to [m]$ has a left adjoint if and only if it preserves the maximum element, i.e., $R(n)=m$.\n\nThe number of adjunctions is the number of such maps $L$, which is also the number of such maps $R$.\n\n**Step 3: Set up the counting problem**\nWe are asked for the number of internal adjunctions from $[23]$ to $[37]$. So we have $m=23$ and $n=37$. Let's count the number of left adjoints $L: [23] \\to [37]$.\n\nThis is the number of non-decreasing functions $L: \\{0, 1, \\dots, 23\\} \\to \\{0, 1, \\dots, 37\\}$ such that $L(0)=0$.\nA function is defined by its sequence of values $L(0), L(1), \\dots, L(23)$. The conditions are:\n1.  $L(0) = 0$.\n2.  The sequence is non-decreasing: $L(0) \\leq L(1) \\leq \\dots \\leq L(23)$.\n3.  The values are in the codomain: $0 \\leq L(i) \\leq 37$.\n\nCombining these, we need to count the number of sequences $L(1), \\dots, L(23)$ satisfying:\n$0 \\leq L(1) \\leq L(2) \\leq \\dots \\leq L(23) \\leq 37$.\n\n**Step 4: Solve the counting problem**\nThis is a classic combinatorial problem. We are choosing a non-decreasing sequence of length $k=23$ from the set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 37\\}$. The size of this set of possible values is $37+1=38$.\n\nThis is equivalent to choosing a multiset of size $k=23$ from a set of $N=38$ elements. The formula for the number of such multisets is the multiset coefficient, often found using a \"stars and bars\" argument:\n$$ \\binom{N+k-1}{k} = \\binom{38+23-1}{23} = \\binom{60}{23} $$\n\nAlternatively, one can establish a bijection between these non-decreasing sequences and strictly increasing sequences. A non-decreasing sequence $0 \\leq y_1 \\leq \\dots \\leq y_k \\leq n$ corresponds to a unique strictly increasing sequence $1 \\leq y_1+1 < y_2+2 < \\dots < y_k+k \\leq n+k$. The problem is then to choose $k$ distinct numbers from the set $\\{1, 2, \\dots, n+k\\}$. The number of ways to do this is $\\binom{n+k}{k}$.\nFor our problem, we count non-decreasing sequences $L(1), \\dots, L(23)$ (so $k=23$) from $\\{0, \\dots, 37\\}$ (so $n=37$). The number is:\n$$ \\binom{37+23}{23} = \\binom{60}{23} $$\n\nAs a check, we could count the number of right adjoints $R: [37] \\to [23]$ satisfying $R(37)=23$. This requires choosing a non-decreasing sequence $R(0), \\dots, R(36)$ (length $k'=37$) from $\\{0, \\dots, 23\\}$ (value range size $n'=23+1=24$). The number is $\\binom{23+37}{37} = \\binom{60}{37}$.\nSince $\\binom{60}{23} = \\binom{60}{60-37} = \\binom{60}{37}$, both counts agree.\n\nThe final answer is the number represented by the binomial coefficient $\\binom{60}{23}$.\n\n<<<C(60, 23)>>>"
