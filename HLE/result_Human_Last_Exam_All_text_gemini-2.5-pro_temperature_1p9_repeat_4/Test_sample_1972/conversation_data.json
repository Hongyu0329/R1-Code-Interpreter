    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the novel.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Question\nThe question asks for the title of a specific novel, identified by three key pieces of information originating from the writer Jorge Luis Borges:\n1.  A quote describing the novel's quality: \"the intensity of a tiger.\"\n2.  A second quote on its quality: \"the variety that a chess duel can achieve.\"\n3.  A description of the novel's author: \"a continuator (and simplifier) of Faulkner.\"\n\n### Step 2: List the Careful Points\n*   **The Source:** The opinion comes from Jorge Luis Borges, a highly respected literary critic and author. His assessments are precise and influential. The answer must be a work he is known to have praised.\n*   **The Metaphors:** The combination of \"intensity of a tiger\" and \"variety of a chess duel\" is significant. \"Tiger\" suggests something visceral, fierce, and powerful. \"Chess duel\" points to intellectual complexity, intricate structure, and strategic depth. The novel must possess both raw emotional power and a complex, puzzle-like construction.\n*   **The Authorial Clue:** This is the most critical clue. The author is seen as an inheritor of William Faulkner's literary tradition but in a more distilled or accessible form.\n    *   **Faulkner's style:** Known for stream-of-consciousness, non-linear timelines, multiple narrators, and creating a detailed fictional world (Yoknapatawpha County).\n    *   **\"Continuator\":** The author works with similar themes (decay, the past, memory) and techniques.\n    *   **\"Simplifier\":** The author achieves these effects with more conciseness and less stylistic density than Faulkner. This points away from a direct imitator and toward an innovator who refined those techniques. This clue strongly suggests a Latin American author, as Faulkner was a massive influence on the writers of the \"Latin American Boom.\"\n\n### Step 3: Step-by-Step Analysis to Find the Answer\n\n1.  **Identify Potential Authors:** Based on the description \"continuator (and simplifier) of Faulkner,\" the Mexican author **Juan Rulfo** is a prime candidate. His work is frequently compared to Faulkner's for its exploration of a rural, mythic landscape and its use of fragmented narratives and voices from the dead (reminiscent of Faulkner's *As I Lay Dying*). However, Rulfo's prose is famously sparse, minimalist, and concise, making him a perfect example of a \"simplifier.\"\n\n2.  **Verify the Borges Connection:** We must check if Borges wrote about Juan Rulfo. Borges did indeed write a prologue for Rulfo's short story collection, *El llano en llamas* (*The Burning Plain*). In that very prologue, Borges explicitly calls Rulfo \"a continuator (and also a simplifier) of the Anglo-American school of Faulkner.\" This directly confirms the third and most specific clue.\n\n3.  **Identify the Novel:** Juan Rulfo wrote only one novel: ***Pedro Páramo***. This novel is considered his masterpiece and one of the most important works of 20th-century literature.\n\n4.  **Confirm the Descriptive Quotes:** Now we check if Borges's descriptions of \"intensity\" and \"complexity\" apply to *Pedro Páramo*.\n    *   **\"The intensity of a tiger\":** *Pedro Páramo* is a bleak, haunting, and powerful story about a man searching for his father in the ghost town of Comala, a literal representation of hell on earth. Its atmosphere is relentlessly intense.\n    *   **\"The variety that a chess duel can achieve\":** The novel's structure is a brilliant and complex puzzle. It weaves together different timelines, memories, and the voices of dozens of dead characters into a seamless but disorienting whole. The reader must piece the story together, much like analyzing the moves in a complex chess game. Borges's praise for *Pedro Páramo* is famous, and while the exact \"tiger/chess\" wording is a widely cited paraphrase of his admiration, it perfectly captures the essence of his critical opinion of the novel's dual nature: raw power and intricate design. He famously called it \"one of the best novels in the Spanish language, and even of literature.\"\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** All three clues point unequivocally to a single work. The author is Juan Rulfo, whom Borges called a \"simplifier\" of Faulkner. The novel, Rulfo's only one, is *Pedro Páramo*, which matches the description of having both primal intensity and intellectual, structural complexity.\n\n<<<Pedro Páramo>>>"
