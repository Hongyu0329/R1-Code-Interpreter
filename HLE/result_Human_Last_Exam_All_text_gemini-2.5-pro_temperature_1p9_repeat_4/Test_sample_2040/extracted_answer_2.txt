No, free-standing boron nanosheets would not be expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric downconversion. This is because SPDC is a second-order nonlinear optical process that requires a material with a non-centrosymmetric crystal structure. The common and stable phases of borophene possess a center of inversion symmetry (i.e., they are centrosymmetric), which forbids second-order nonlinear effects.
