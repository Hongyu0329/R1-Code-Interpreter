    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the probability of finding the particle in the specified interval.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the System and the Goal**\n\nThe problem describes a quantum mechanical particle confined to a one-dimensional box (also known as an infinite potential well) of length 'a'. The box extends from $x=0$ to $x=a$. We are interested in the particle's state corresponding to the quantum number $n=2$. The goal is to calculate the probability of finding this particle within a very small interval, from $x_1 = 0.495a$ to $x_2 = 0.505a$.\n\n**2. Recall the Wavefunction and Probability Density**\n\nThe state of the particle is described by its wavefunction, $\\psi_n(x)$. For a 1D box of length 'a', the normalized wavefunction is given by:\n$\\psi_n(x) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{a}} \\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{a}\\right)$\n\nThe probability of finding the particle at a given position $x$ is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the wavefunction, which is the probability density, $P(x) = |\\psi_n(x)|^2$.\n\nFor the given state $n=2$, the wavefunction is:\n$\\psi_2(x) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{a}} \\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x}{a}\\right)$\n\nAnd the probability density is:\n$|\\psi_2(x)|^2 = \\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{a}} \\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x}{a}\\right)\\right)^2 = \\frac{2}{a} \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x}{a}\\right)$\n\n**3. Set Up the Probability Integral**\n\nThe probability of finding the particle in the interval from $x_1$ to $x_2$ is found by integrating the probability density over that interval:\n$P = \\int_{x_1}^{x_2} |\\psi_n(x)|^2 dx$\n\nSubstituting the given values ($n=2$, $x_1 = 0.495a$, $x_2 = 0.505a$):\n$P = \\int_{0.495a}^{0.505a} \\frac{2}{a} \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x}{a}\\right) dx$\n\n**4. Analyze the Integrand and the Interval**\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Location of the Interval.** The interval is from $0.495a$ to $0.505a$. This is a very narrow interval of width $\\Delta x = 0.505a - 0.495a = 0.01a$. It is centered at $x_c = \\frac{0.495a + 0.505a}{2} = 0.5a$.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: The Node.** Let's evaluate the probability density at the center of the interval, $x_c = 0.5a$:\n    $|\\psi_2(0.5a)|^2 = \\frac{2}{a} \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{2\\pi (0.5a)}{a}\\right) = \\frac{2}{a} \\sin^2(\\pi)$\n    Since $\\sin(\\pi) = 0$, the probability density at the center of the box is zero. This point is called a **node**. The interval is centered exactly on this node.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Choosing the Right Calculation Method.** A simple approximation for a small interval is $P \\approx |\\psi(x_c)|^2 \\Delta x$. However, since $|\\psi(x_c)|^2=0$, this approximation would incorrectly yield a probability of zero. We must perform a more precise calculation. Since the interval is small, we can accurately approximate the integrand using a Taylor series expansion around the center point $x_c = 0.5a$.\n\n**5. Perform the Calculation using a Taylor Expansion**\n\nLet $f(x) = |\\psi_2(x)|^2 = \\frac{2}{a} \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x}{a}\\right)$. We will expand this function around $x_c = 0.5a$. The Taylor expansion is:\n$f(x) \\approx f(x_c) + f'(x_c)(x-x_c) + \\frac{f''(x_c)}{2}(x-x_c)^2 + \\dots$\n\n*   First term: $f(x_c) = f(0.5a) = 0$, as calculated above.\n*   First derivative:\n    $f'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx} \\left(\\frac{2}{a} \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x}{a}\\right)\\right) = \\frac{2}{a} \\cdot 2\\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x}{a}\\right)\\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x}{a}\\right) \\cdot \\frac{2\\pi}{a} = \\frac{4\\pi}{a^2}\\sin\\left(\\frac{4\\pi x}{a}\\right)$\n    At $x_c = 0.5a$: $f'(0.5a) = \\frac{4\\pi}{a^2}\\sin\\left(\\frac{4\\pi(0.5a)}{a}\\right) = \\frac{4\\pi}{a^2}\\sin(2\\pi) = 0$.\n*   Second derivative:\n    $f''(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}\\left(\\frac{4\\pi}{a^2}\\sin\\left(\\frac{4\\pi x}{a}\\right)\\right) = \\frac{4\\pi}{a^2}\\cos\\left(\\frac{4\\pi x}{a}\\right)\\cdot\\frac{4\\pi}{a} = \\frac{16\\pi^2}{a^3}\\cos\\left(\\frac{4\\pi x}{a}\\right)$\n    At $x_c = 0.5a$: $f''(0.5a) = \\frac{16\\pi^2}{a^3}\\cos\\left(\\frac{4\\pi(0.5a)}{a}\\right) = \\frac{16\\pi^2}{a^3}\\cos(2\\pi) = \\frac{16\\pi^2}{a^3}$.\n\nSince the first two terms are zero, the integrand is well-approximated by the second-order term:\n$|\\psi_2(x)|^2 \\approx \\frac{1}{2}f''(0.5a)(x - 0.5a)^2 = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{16\\pi^2}{a^3}\\right)(x - 0.5a)^2 = \\frac{8\\pi^2}{a^3}(x-0.5a)^2$\n\nNow, we integrate this approximation over the interval:\n$P \\approx \\int_{0.495a}^{0.505a} \\frac{8\\pi^2}{a^3}(x-0.5a)^2 dx$\n\nLet's make a substitution $u = x - 0.5a$, so $du=dx$. The new limits of integration are from $(0.495a - 0.5a) = -0.005a$ to $(0.505a - 0.5a) = 0.005a$.\n\n$P \\approx \\int_{-0.005a}^{0.005a} \\frac{8\\pi^2}{a^3} u^2 du = \\frac{8\\pi^2}{a^3} \\left[ \\frac{u^3}{3} \\right]_{-0.005a}^{0.005a}$\n\n$P \\approx \\frac{8\\pi^2}{3a^3} \\left[ (0.005a)^3 - (-0.005a)^3 \\right] = \\frac{8\\pi^2}{3a^3} \\left[ 2 \\cdot (0.005a)^3 \\right]$\n\n$P \\approx \\frac{16\\pi^2}{3a^3} (0.005^3 a^3) = \\frac{16\\pi^2}{3} (0.005)^3$\n\n**6. Calculate the Final Numerical Value**\n\nNow, we compute the final number:\n$P \\approx \\frac{16\\pi^2}{3} (5 \\times 10^{-3})^3$\n$P \\approx \\frac{16\\pi^2}{3} (125 \\times 10^{-9})$\n$P \\approx \\frac{16 \\times 125}{3} \\pi^2 \\times 10^{-9}$\n$P \\approx \\frac{2000}{3} \\pi^2 \\times 10^{-9} = \\frac{2}{3} \\pi^2 \\times 10^{-6}$\n\nUsing the value $\\pi^2 \\approx 9.8696$:\n$P \\approx \\frac{2}{3} (9.8696) \\times 10^{-6} \\approx 6.5797 \\times 10^{-6}$\n\nThe probability is approximately $0.00000658$."
