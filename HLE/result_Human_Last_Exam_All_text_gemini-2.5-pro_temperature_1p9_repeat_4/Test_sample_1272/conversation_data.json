    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the current Vietnamese province where Ming General Mu Sheng experienced his first major defeat.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Historical Context:** The question refers to the period of the Ming Dynasty's occupation of Vietnam, known in Vietnamese history as the Fourth Era of Northern Domination (1407-1427). The key conflict during this time was the Lam Sơn uprising, led by the future emperor Lê Lợi against the Ming occupation.\n\n2.  **Identify the General and the Event:**\n    *   **General:** Mu Sheng (沐晟) was a high-ranking Ming general from a family that had governed Yunnan for generations. He was a key figure in the Ming campaigns in Vietnam.\n    *   **Event:** We are looking for his \"first major defeat.\" This implies a significant battle where his forces were decisively beaten, not a minor skirmish.\n\n3.  **Examine Mu Sheng's Campaigns in Vietnam:**\n    *   Mu Sheng was involved in the initial invasion of 1406-1407 which was successful. He was also involved in suppressing early rebellions. However, the Lam Sơn Uprising, which began in 1418, grew into a full-scale war of independence.\n    *   In late 1426, Ming forces under General Wang Tong suffered a catastrophic defeat at the Battle of Tốt Động – Chúc Động. This was a major Ming defeat, but it was not Mu Sheng's.\n    *   In response to this, the Ming Emperor dispatched a massive relief expedition in 1427, divided into two main armies.\n        *   One army was led by General Liu Sheng (柳升), advancing from Guangxi.\n        *   The second army was led by **General Mu Sheng**, advancing from Yunnan.\n\n4.  **Pinpoint Mu Sheng's Major Defeat:**\n    *   Liu Sheng's army was the first to engage and was completely annihilated at the famous Battle of Chi Lăng - Xương Giang (in modern-day Lạng Sơn province). This was a decisive victory for Lê Lợi, but it was Liu Sheng's defeat, not Mu Sheng's.\n    *   Mu Sheng's army, advancing from the west, had reached the Vietnamese border. Upon receiving the news of Liu Sheng's total destruction, the morale of Mu Sheng's troops collapsed. Mu Sheng immediately ordered a retreat back to Yunnan.\n    *   Lê Lợi had anticipated this and had dispatched generals Phạm Văn Xảo and Trịnh Khả to intercept the Yunnan army. They set up ambushes along Mu Sheng's retreat path.\n    *   The Vietnamese forces caught up with Mu Sheng's retreating and disorganized army, attacking them at **Lãnh Câu (冷溝) and Đan Xá (丹舍)**. Mu Sheng's army was routed, suffering thousands of casualties and losing vast amounts of supplies and equipment. Mu Sheng himself barely escaped with his life.\n    *   This event was Mu Sheng's most significant and unambiguous personal defeat in the war, marking the complete failure of the final Ming relief effort and leading to their ultimate withdrawal from Vietnam.\n\n5.  **Identify the Modern Location:**\n    *   Mu Sheng's route was from Yunnan, China, into the northwestern part of Vietnam. His defeat at Lãnh Câu and Đan Xá occurred in this mountainous border region as he tried to escape back into Yunnan.\n    *   Historical mapping and scholarly analysis of the campaign route place these ambush sites within the territory of the present-day **Điện Biên Province**. This province borders Yunnan and its mountainous terrain fits the historical descriptions of the battle perfectly.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider:\n\n*   **Distinguish from other battles:** It's crucial not to confuse Mu Sheng's defeat with the more famous Battle of Chi Lăng (Liu Sheng's defeat) or the Battle of Tốt Động-Chúc Động (Wang Tong's defeat).\n*   **\"First Major Defeat\":** While Mu Sheng may have faced setbacks earlier, the rout of his entire army in 1427 was his first catastrophic failure as the primary commander, representing a major strategic defeat for the Ming empire.\n*   **Modern vs. Historical Names:** The question specifically asks for the *current* province name, requiring a connection between the historical battle sites (Lãnh Câu, Đan Xá) and modern Vietnamese administrative divisions (Điện Biên Province).\n\n### Final Answer Acquisition:\n\nThe analysis confirms that Ming General Mu Sheng's first major defeat occurred during his retreat from Vietnam in 1427. His army was routed by Vietnamese forces under Phạm Văn Xảo at Lãnh Câu and Đan Xá. These historical locations are situated in what is now modern Điện Biên Province.\n\n<<<Điện Biên Province>>>"
