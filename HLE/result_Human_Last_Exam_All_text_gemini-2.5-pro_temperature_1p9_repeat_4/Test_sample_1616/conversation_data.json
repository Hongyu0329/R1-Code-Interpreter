    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**1. Understand the Linguistic Rule: Trisyllabic Laxing**\n\nTrisyllabic laxing (or trisyllabic shortening) is a historical sound change in English. It describes the process where a long vowel in a stressed syllable becomes short if it is followed by two or more syllables (i.e., when it is in the antepenultimate syllable, which is the third syllable from the end of the word).\n\n*   **Key Conditions:**\n    1.  The vowel must have been historically long.\n    2.  The vowel must be in the third-to-last syllable of a word.\n    3.  The syllable containing the vowel is typically stressed.\n\n*   **Classic Example:** The vowel 'a' in `sane` is long (pronounced /eɪ/). When the suffix `-ity` is added to form `sanity`, the 'a' is now in the third-to-last syllable (`san-i-ty`). The vowel shortens to /æ/.\n\n**2. Analyze Each Word**\n\nWe will examine each word in the list to see if it shows evidence of this change, often by comparing it to a related, shorter word where the vowel remains long.\n\n*   **southern**\n    *   **Related word:** `south` (vowel is the diphthong /aʊ/, which developed from the Old English long vowel /uː/).\n    *   **Analysis:** In `southern` (/ˈsʌðərn/), the vowel is shortened to /ʌ/. However, `southern` has only **two** syllables (`south-ern`). Therefore, the shortening cannot be due to *trisyllabic* laxing. The shortening here is caused by a different rule (vowel shortening before certain consonant clusters).\n    *   **Conclusion:** Has **not** undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n*   **derivative**\n    *   **Related word:** `derive` (the 'i' is a long diphthong /aɪ/).\n    *   **Analysis:** In `derivative` (/dɪˈrɪvətɪv/), the word has four syllables (`de-riv-a-tive`). The vowel corresponding to the one in `derive` has been shortened to /ɪ/. The syllable containing this vowel (`-riv-`) is now in the antepenultimate position relative to the suffixed stem, which triggers the rule.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Has undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n*   **serenity**\n    *   **Related word:** `serene` (the 'e' is a long vowel /iː/).\n    *   **Analysis:** In `serenity` (/səˈrenəti/), the word has four syllables (`se-ren-i-ty`). The second syllable (`-ren-`) is the third from the end (antepenultimate). The long vowel from `serene` has been shortened to /e/.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Has undergone trisyllabic laxing. This is a textbook example.\n\n*   **pleasant**\n    *   **Related word:** `please` (the 'ea' is a long vowel /iː/).\n    *   **Analysis:** In `pleasant` (/ˈplezənt/), the vowel is shortened to /e/. However, `pleasant` has only **two** syllables (`pleas-ant`). Just like `southern`, it did not undergo shortening because of the trisyllabic rule.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Has **not** undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n*   **gratitude**\n    *   **Related word:** The root comes from Latin `grātus`, where 'ā' was long. This long vowel is preserved in the related English word `grateful` (/ˈɡreɪtfʊl/), which has the long vowel sound /eɪ/.\n    *   **Analysis:** `Gratitude` (/ˈɡrætɪtjuːd/) is a three-syllable word (`grat-i-tude`). The first syllable is the antepenultimate one. The vowel here is the short /æ/.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Has undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n*   **shadow**\n    *   **Etymology:** The word comes from Old English *sceadu*. In Old English, the `ea` represented a short vowel.\n    *   **Analysis:** The modern word `shadow` (/ˈʃædoʊ/) has a short vowel /æ/ in its first syllable. Since the vowel in this word's ancestor was **already short**, it could not have been shortened by trisyllabic laxing (or any other shortening process). Furthermore, the word only has two syllables.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Has **not** undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n**3. Determine the Final Answer**\n\nWe have identified three words that have **not** undergone trisyllabic laxing: `southern`, `pleasant`, and `shadow`. They are all two-syllable words, so the \"trisyllabic\" condition is not met. However, the question asks for a single answer, implying one is the \"best\" fit.\n\n*   `southern` and `pleasant` are both derived from base words (`south`, `please`) that have long vowels. The vowels were shortened by a different historical rule.\n*   `shadow` is unique in this list because its vowel was historically short from the beginning. Therefore, it was never even eligible for vowel shortening. It could not \"undergo\" a change from long to short because it was never long.\n\nThis makes `shadow` the most definitive answer, as it fails to meet the conditions for trisyllabic laxing on two fundamental counts: it is not trisyllabic, and its vowel was never long.\n\n<<<shadow>>>"
