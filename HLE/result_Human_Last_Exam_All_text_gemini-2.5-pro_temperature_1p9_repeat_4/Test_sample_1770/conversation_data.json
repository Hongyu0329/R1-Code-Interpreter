    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The primary objective is to engineer *Corynebacterium glutamicum* to accumulate p-coumaric acid. The biosynthesis pathway has been successfully introduced, but the product is being consumed by the cell.\n2.  **Identify the Problem:** The produced p-coumaric acid is being degraded. This means that *C. glutamicum* possesses a native metabolic pathway that uses p-coumaric acid as a substrate, likely as a carbon and energy source.\n3.  **Formulate a Strategy:** To prevent the degradation of p-coumaric acid, the metabolic pathway responsible for its breakdown must be blocked. The most effective way to do this is by knocking out the gene that encodes the first enzyme in this degradation pathway. This prevents the compound from entering the catabolic route.\n4.  **Investigate the Metabolic Pathways in *C. glutamicum*:** We need to identify the specific pathway for p-coumaric acid catabolism in *C. glutamicum*. Research on the metabolism of aromatic compounds in this bacterium reveals a well-characterized pathway for the degradation of ferulic acid and p-coumaric acid.\n5.  **Pinpoint the First Step of Degradation:** In *C. glutamicum*, the catabolism of p-coumaric acid begins with its activation into a thioester with Coenzyme A (CoA). This is a common strategy in bacterial degradation of aromatic acids. The specific reaction is:\n    *p-coumaric acid + ATP + CoA â†’ p-coumaroyl-CoA + AMP + PPi*\n6.  **Identify the Responsible Enzyme and Gene:** The enzyme that catalyzes this initial activation step is a **feruloyl-CoA synthetase**, which also exhibits activity on p-coumaric acid. In the model strain *Corynebacterium glutamicum* ATCC 13032, this enzyme is encoded by the gene **`fcs`** (locus tag `cg2933`).\n7.  **Confirm the Consequences of Knocking Out the Gene:** If the `fcs` gene is knocked out, the cell can no longer produce feruloyl-CoA synthetase. Without this enzyme, p-coumaric acid cannot be converted to p-coumaroyl-CoA. Since this is the first committed step of the degradation pathway, the p-coumaric acid produced by the engineered biosynthetic pathway will be unable to enter the catabolic route and will consequently accumulate in the cell or the medium.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Specificity:** It is crucial to target the correct pathway. While other degradation pathways for phenolic acids exist in different bacteria (e.g., via phenolic acid decarboxylases), the CoA-dependent pathway involving `fcs` is the established primary route in *C. glutamicum*.\n*   **Target Selection:** Targeting the very first step (`fcs`) is generally the most efficient strategy. Knocking out downstream genes (like `ech`, which catalyzes the next step) would also work, but targeting the entry-point enzyme is the most direct and common approach in metabolic engineering.\n*   **Gene Nomenclature:** The gene may be referred to by its standard name (`fcs`) or its locus tag (`cg2933` in the reference strain). Both refer to the same genetic element encoding feruloyl-CoA synthetase.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nTo prevent the degradation of p-coumaric acid in *Corynebacterium glutamicum*, the gene that should be knocked out is the one encoding the enzyme that catalyzes the first step of its catabolism. This enzyme is feruloyl-CoA synthetase, and the corresponding gene is `fcs`.\n\n<<<fcs>>>"
