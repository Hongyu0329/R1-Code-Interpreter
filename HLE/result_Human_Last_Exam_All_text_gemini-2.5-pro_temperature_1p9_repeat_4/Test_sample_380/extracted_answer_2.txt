No, the local magnetic field at the L1 point is not considered radial; it typically follows the Parker Spiral. The use of magnetic field components perpendicular to the radial direction is justified by Taylor's "frozen-in flow" Hypothesis. The solar wind's high, radial velocity is much faster than the wave's propagation speed, causing the wave structure to be swept over the spacecraft along the radial direction. This makes the apparent propagation direction in the spacecraft's measurement frame radial, thus validating the use of a coordinate system aligned with the radial flow to calculate polarization properties like normalized magnetic helicity.
