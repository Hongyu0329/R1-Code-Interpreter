    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the number sequence problem.\n\n**Step 1: Write down the sequence and look for a primary pattern.**\nThe given sequence is: 2, 11, 23, 51, 119, ( )\nLet's first examine the differences between consecutive terms (the first-level difference).\n- Term 2 - Term 1 = 11 - 2 = 9\n- Term 3 - Term 2 = 23 - 11 = 12\n- Term 4 - Term 3 = 51 - 23 = 28\n- Term 5 - Term 4 = 119 - 51 = 68\nThe sequence of differences is 9, 12, 28, 68. This sequence does not have an obvious simple pattern like a constant difference or ratio.\n\n**Step 2: Look for a multiplicative relationship between consecutive terms.**\nLet's see if the next term can be derived from the previous term by multiplying by a constant and adding/subtracting another number. A common pattern in such sequences is doubling the previous term.\n- `2 * Term 1 = 2 * 2 = 4`. The actual `Term 2` is 11. `11 = 4 + 7`.\n- `2 * Term 2 = 2 * 11 = 22`. The actual `Term 3` is 23. `23 = 22 + 1`.\n- `2 * Term 3 = 2 * 23 = 46`. The actual `Term 4` is 51. `51 = 46 + 5`.\n- `2 * Term 4 = 2 * 51 = 102`. The actual `Term 5` is 119. `119 = 102 + 17`.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the identified pattern.**\nFrom Step 2, we have found a recursive relationship:\n- `Term 2 = 2 * Term 1 + 7`\n- `Term 3 = 2 * Term 2 + 1`\n- `Term 4 = 2 * Term 3 + 5`\n- `Term 5 = 2 * Term 4 + 17`\nThe pattern seems to be `T(n) = 2 * T(n-1) + C(n-1)`. The sequence of the added numbers, `C`, is `7, 1, 5, 17, ...`. This sequence doesn't seem to follow a simple rule.\n\n**Careful Point:** Often, the first term of a sequence is a 'seed' value and the primary pattern starts from the second or third term. Let's ignore the first calculation (`+7`) and look at the additive sequence starting from the next term: `1, 5, 17, ...`. Let's call this new sequence `C'`.\n\n**Step 4: Find the pattern in the new sequence `C' = {1, 5, 17, ...}`.**\nLet's try to find a rule for `C'`.\n- Look at the differences between terms in `C'`:\n  - `5 - 1 = 4`\n  - `17 - 5 = 12`\n- The sequence of differences is `4, 12, ...`. This is a geometric progression where each term is 3 times the previous one (`4 * 3 = 12`).\n- Following this pattern, the next difference should be `12 * 3 = 36`.\n- Therefore, the next term in the sequence `C'` would be `17 + 36 = 53`.\n\n(Alternative analysis for `C'`):\n- We can also find a recursive formula for `C'`. Let `C'(n) = a * C'(n-1) + b`.\n  - For `n=2`: `5 = a * 1 + b`\n  - For `n=3`: `17 = a * 5 + b`\n- Subtracting the first equation from the second gives: `12 = 4a`, which means `a = 3`.\n- Substituting `a = 3` into the first equation: `5 = 3 * 1 + b`, which means `b = 2`.\n- So the rule for `C'` is `C'(n) = 3 * C'(n-1) + 2`. Let's check:\n  - `C'(2) = 3 * C'(1) + 2 = 3 * 1 + 2 = 5`. Correct.\n  - `C'(3) = 3 * C'(2) + 2 = 3 * 5 + 2 = 17`. Correct.\n- The next term `C'(4)` will be `3 * C'(3) + 2 = 3 * 17 + 2 = 51 + 2 = 53`.\nBoth methods yield 53 as the next number to be added.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the missing term in the original sequence.**\nThe pattern for the original sequence `T` is `T(n) = 2 * T(n-1) + C'(n-2)` for n >= 3.\nWe need to find `T(6)`.\n- `T(6) = 2 * T(5) + C'(4)`\n- We know `T(5) = 119` and we just calculated `C'(4) = 53`.\n- `T(6) = 2 * 119 + 53`\n- `T(6) = 238 + 53`\n- `T(6) = 291`\n\nThe number that should be filled in the parentheses is 291. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
