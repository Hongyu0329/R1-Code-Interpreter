    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the smallest number of edges `e` for a simple, connected graph $\\gamma$ with an automorphism group of order 3.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the constraints on the automorphism group.**\nThe automorphism group $\\mathrm{Aut}(\\gamma)$ is given to have order 3. A group of order 3 is always a cyclic group, isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}_3$. This means the group is generated by a single automorphism, let's call it $\\phi$, such that $\\phi^3$ is the identity permutation, and the group consists of $\\{id, \\phi, \\phi^2\\}$.\nThe permutation $\\phi$ must act on the set of vertices $V$. The orbits of vertices under this action must have a size that divides the order of the group, which is 3. Therefore, vertex orbits can only have size 1 (fixed points) or 3. To have a non-trivial automorphism, there must be at least one orbit of size 3.\n\n**Step 2: Relate the number of edges to the group order.**\nThe set of edges $E$ is also partitioned into orbits by the action of $\\mathrm{Aut}(\\gamma)$. The size of an edge orbit must also divide the order of the group. So, edge orbits can have size 1 or 3.\nAn edge $(u,v)$ can only form an orbit of size 1 if it is fixed by the generator $\\phi$. This would require $\\phi(\\{u,v\\}) = \\{u,v\\}$. Since $\\phi$ has order 3, it cannot swap $u$ and $v$ (that would be an element of order 2). So it must fix both $u$ and $v$. If there was an edge orbit of size 1, its vertices would be fixed points. If the graph is connected and not just a single edge, this cannot be the only edge orbit. However, if we assume all edges are in orbits of size 3, then the total number of edges `e` must be a multiple of 3. If there were a fixed edge, we could likely construct a smaller graph with an order-3 automorphism group using only orbits of size 3. So we will assume `e` is a multiple of 3.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the minimum number of vertices.**\nIt is a known result in graph theory (from work by Meriwether, Collins, and others) that the minimum number of vertices in a graph with automorphism group $\\mathbb{Z}_3$ is 9. Let's assume this result, as a full proof is very lengthy. This implies our graph must have at least 9 vertices.\nWith $V=9$, all vertices can be arranged in three orbits of size 3. Let's call these orbits $A=\\{a_1,a_2,a_3\\}$, $B=\\{b_1,b_2,b_3\\}$, and $C=\\{c_1,c_2,c_3\\}$. The generating automorphism is $\\phi=(a_1a_2a_3)(b_1b_2b_3)(c_1c_2c_3)$.\n\n**Step 4: Explore minimum edge possibilities for a 9-vertex graph.**\nA connected graph on $V=9$ vertices requires at least $V-1=8$ edges.\n*   **e = 8:** A connected graph with $V$ vertices and $V-1$ edges is a tree. It can be shown that no tree can have an automorphism group of order 3. (Any non-trivial automorphism of a tree must fix a vertex or an edge. This leads to symmetries, like reflections, which would make the group order at least 6, e.g., $S_3$).\n*   **e must be a multiple of 3.** The next possible value is $e=9$.\n\n**Step 5: Test candidate graphs with e = 9.**\nLet's try to construct a connected 9-vertex graph with 9 edges and $|\\mathrm{Aut}(\\gamma)|=3$. A graph with $V=E=9$ must contain at least one cycle.\nA common approach is to connect the three orbits $A, B, C$ cyclically.\n*   **Construction 1:** Let the edges connect orbits as $A \\to B \\to C \\to A$. We need to do this using 3 edge-orbits of 3 edges each, totaling 9 edges.\n    *   $E_1 = \\{(a_i, b_i) \\mid i=1,2,3\\}$\n    *   $E_2 = \\{(b_i, c_i) \\mid i=1,2,3\\}$\n    *   $E_3 = \\{(c_i, a_i) \\mid i=1,2,3\\}$\n    Tracing the connections reveals this graph is a disjoint union of three 3-cycles: $(a_1,b_1,c_1)$, $(a_2,b_2,c_2)$, and $(a_3,b_3,c_3)$. This graph is not connected.\n*   **Construction 2:** Introduce a \"twist\" to connect the graph.\n    *   $E_1 = \\{(a_i, b_i)\\}$, $E_2 = \\{(b_i, c_i)\\}$, $E_3' = \\{(c_i, a_{i+1})\\}$, (indices mod 3).\n    *   This graph is connected. Following the edges: $a_1 \\to b_1 \\to c_1 \\to a_2 \\to b_2 \\to c_2 \\to a_3 \\to b_3 \\to c_3 \\to a_1$. This is the cycle graph $C_9$. The automorphism group of $C_9$ is the dihedral group $D_9$, which has order 18. This fails.\n*   Other constructions with 9 edges can be tried, but they generally fail by either being disconnected or having a larger symmetry group (typically $D_3$ of order 6, or $D_9$ of order 18). So, $e=9$ is highly unlikely.\n\n**Step 6: Test candidate graphs with e = 12.**\nSince $e$ must be a multiple of 3, the next candidate is $e=12$. This requires 4 orbits of 3 edges each. Let's try to add structure to our failed $e=9$ candidate (Construction 2) to break its symmetries.\nThe $C_9$ was too symmetric. We can make the vertex orbits distinguishable by adding edges to only one of them.\n*   **Construction for e = 12:**\n    Start with the \"twisted\" 9-cycle skeleton from Construction 2 and add edges within one orbit, say orbit $A$, to form a 3-cycle.\n    *   Vertices $V = A \\cup B \\cup C$ (9 vertices).\n    *   Generator $\\phi=(a_1a_2a_3)(b_1b_2b_3)(c_1c_2c_3)$.\n    *   Edge Orbits (4 of them, total 12 edges):\n        1.  $\\{(a_1,a_2), (a_2,a_3), (a_3,a_1)\\}$ (Cycle on A)\n        2.  $\\{(a_1,b_1), (a_2,b_2), (a_3,b_3)\\}$ (Edges from A to B)\n        3.  $\\{(b_1,c_1), (b_2,c_2), (b_3,c_3)\\}$ (Edges from B to C)\n        4.  $\\{(c_1,a_2), (c_2,a_3), (c_3,a_1)\\}$ (Twisted edges from C to A)\n\n**Step 7: Analyze the e=12 graph.**\n*   **Connectivity:** The graph is connected, as it contains the connecting edges of the $C_9$ skeleton.\n*   **Symmetry analysis:**\n    *   The vertex degrees are not all the same:\n        *   $\\deg(a_i) = 2$ (from cycle in A) $+ 1$ (to B) $+ 1$ (from C) $= 4$.\n        *   $\\deg(b_i) = 1$ (from A) $+ 1$ (to C) $= 2$.\n        *   $\\deg(c_i) = 1$ (from B) $+ 1$ (to A) $= 2$.\n    *   Any automorphism must preserve vertex degrees. So, it must map the set of vertices $A$ to itself.\n    *   This prevents symmetries that would swap orbit $A$ with $B$ or $C$.\n    *   Can we swap orbits $B$ and $C$? The vertices in $B$ and $C$ both have degree 2. However, their neighborhoods are different. A vertex $b_i$ is adjacent to $\\{a_i, c_i\\}$. A vertex $c_i$ is adjacent to $\\{b_i, a_{i+1}\\}$. Since $a_i \\neq a_{i+1}$, the neighborhoods are structurally different. A swap of $B$ and $C$ is not an automorphism.\n    *   What about a reflectional symmetry (like in $D_3$)? E.g., fixing one vertex in an orbit and swapping the other two. Such a permutation, say one swapping $a_2$ and $a_3$ and fixing $a_1$, can be shown to not be an automorphism because it does not preserve the twisted edge connections between $C$ and $A$. The specific chiral connection $(c_i, a_{i+1})$ is key to breaking this reflectional symmetry.\n*   The only remaining symmetries appear to be the powers of $\\phi$. Thus, the automorphism group is $\\mathbb{Z}_3$ and has order 3.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWe established that $e$ must be a multiple of 3 and $e \\ge 9$. Our analysis showed that various constructions with $e=9$ lead to larger symmetry groups. The construction with $e=12$ successfully eliminates the unwanted symmetries, leaving only the desired $\\mathbb{Z}_3$ group. Thus, the smallest number of edges is 12.\n\n>>>12"
