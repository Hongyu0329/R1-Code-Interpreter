    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which museum acquired the painting.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify Key Information:**\n    *   **Artwork:** \"The Radionist\" (German title: \"Der Radionist\")\n    *   **Artist:** Kurt Günther\n    *   **Creation Year:** 1927\n    *   **Medium:** Tempera\n    *   **Acquisition Year:** 1967\n    *   **Question:** Which museum acquired it in that year?\n\n2.  **Initial Research Strategy:**\n    *   The most direct way to find this information is to search for the painting's provenance (history of ownership).\n    *   Using search terms like `\"The Radionist\" Kurt Günther provenance` or `\"Der Radionist\" Kurt Günther 1967 acquisition` is a good starting point.\n    *   It is often most reliable to check the official online collection database of the museum that currently holds the artwork.\n\n3.  **Executing the Research:**\n    *   A search quickly reveals that the painting is held by the Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden (Dresden State Art Collections) in Germany.\n    *   Specifically, it is part of the collection of the **Galerie Neue Meister** (New Masters Gallery), which is located in the Albertinum building in Dresden.\n    *   Consulting the online database of the Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden provides the official record for the artwork (Inventory number: Gal.-Nr. 3474).\n\n4.  **Verifying the Acquisition Details:**\n    *   The museum's record for \"Der Radionist\" by Kurt Günther confirms all the key details: the artist, title, date (1927), and medium (tempera).\n    *   Crucially, the provenance or acquisition information section (\"Erwerbung\") in the museum's database explicitly states: \"**Erworben 1967 von der Galerie Neue Meister, Dresden**\".\n    *   This translates to: \"**Acquired in 1967 by the Galerie Neue Meister, Dresden**\".\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Correct Name:** Be precise with the museum's name. While it's part of the larger \"Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden,\" the specific gallery that acquired and holds the painting is the \"Galerie Neue Meister.\"\n*   **Language:** The original title of the painting is in German (\"Der Radionist\"), and the museum records are also in German. Correct translation is important. \"Erworben\" directly translates to \"acquired.\"\n*   **Primary Source:** Relying on the museum's own public records is the most accurate method, as it is a primary source for provenance information.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the official records of the Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden, the painting \"The Radionist\" by Kurt Günther was acquired in 1967 by the Galerie Neue Meister.\n\n<<<Galerie Neue Meister, Dresden>>>"
