    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the problem's components:**\n*   **Object of Study:** We are asked for the Crawley-Nordström invariant for a \"Calabi-Yau Link\".\n*   **Defining Equation:** The link is associated with the algebraic variety defined by the polynomial equation:\n    `f = z_1^8*z_3 + z_1^4*z_2^3*z_3 + z_1*z_2^7 + z_1*z_2*z_3*z_4*z_5 + z_2*z_3^4 + z_4^3*z_5 + z_5^3 = 0`.\n*   **Ambient Space:** The variety exists in a 5-dimensional complex space `C^5` whose variables `(z_1, z_2, z_3, z_4, z_5)` have associated weights `w = (22, 29, 49, 50, 75)`. This defines a weighted projective space `WCP^4(22, 29, 49, 50, 75)`.\n*   **Invariant:** The Crawley-Nordström invariant for a simply connected 7-manifold is defined as its second Betti number, `b_2`.\n\n**2. Check the homogeneity of the polynomial:**\nA polynomial is weighted homogeneous of degree `d` if every monomial `z_1^{a_1}z_2^{a_2}z_3^{a_3}z_4^{a_4}z_5^{a_5}` in the polynomial satisfies `a_1w_1 + a_2w_2 + a_3w_3 + a_4w_4 + a_5w_5 = d`. Let's check each term:\n*   `z_1^8*z_3`: `8*22 + 49 = 176 + 49 = 225`\n*   `z_1^4*z_2^3*z_3`: `4*22 + 3*29 + 49 = 88 + 87 + 49 = 224`\n*   `z_1*z_2^7`: `1*22 + 7*29 = 22 + 203 = 225`\n*   `z_1*z_2*z_3*z_4*z_5`: `22 + 29 + 49 + 50 + 75 = 225`\n*   `z_2*z_3^4`: `1*29 + 4*49 = 29 + 196 = 225`\n*   `z_4^3*z_5`: `3*50 + 75 = 150 + 75 = 225`\n*   `z_5^3`: `3*75 = 225`\n\n**Careful Point 1:** The polynomial is not weighted homogeneous as given. The term `z_1^4z_2^3z_3` has degree 224, while all other terms have degree 225. This is almost certainly a typo in the problem statement. The standard construction requires a weighted homogeneous polynomial. We will proceed by assuming this term is erroneous and should be disregarded, making the polynomial weighted homogeneous of degree `d = 225`.\n\n**3. Verify the Calabi-Yau condition:**\nA hypersurface in a weighted projective space is called Calabi-Yau if its degree `d` equals the sum of the weights of the ambient space.\n*   `d = 225` (from our corrected analysis).\n*   `Σw_i = 22 + 29 + 49 + 50 + 75 = 225`.\n*   Since `d = Σw_i`, the hypersurface `X` defined by `f=0` in `WCP^4(w)` is indeed a Calabi-Yau threefold (or, more precisely, a Calabi-Yau orbifold).\n\n**4. Define the Calabi-Yau Link and its relation to the Calabi-Yau threefold:**\n*   The affine variety defined by `f=0` in `C^5` is a cone over the projective variety `X`.\n*   The \"Calabi-Yau Link,\" which we'll call `K`, is the intersection of this affine cone with a small sphere `S^9` around the origin in `C^5`. `K = {z ∈ C^5 | f(z)=0} ∩ S^9`.\n*   `K` is a 7-dimensional manifold which is a circle (`S^1`) fibration over the 6-dimensional (3-complex-dimensional) Calabi-Yau base `X`.\n*   The invariant is `b_2(K)`.\n\n**5. Relate the Betti numbers of the link `K` and the base `X`:**\nFor an `S^1`-fibration `K` over a base `X`, the Gysin sequence relates their homologies. A standard result derived from this sequence is the relation for the second Betti numbers (with rational coefficients, which is sufficient here):\n`b_2(K) = b_2(X) - 1`.\nTherefore, to find the Crawley-Nordström invariant `b_2(K)`, we need to find `b_2(X)`.\n\n**6. Calculate the second Betti number `b_2(X)` of the Calabi-Yau threefold:**\n*   The Lefschetz hyperplane theorem states that for a generic hypersurface `X` in a projective space `Y`, their Betti numbers are related. For a hypersurface in `WCP^4`, `b_2(X)` is typically equal to `b_2(WCP^4)`.\n*   For a well-formed weighted projective space (which `WCP^4(22, 29, 49, 50, 75)` is), `b_2(WCP^4) = 1`. So for a *generic* hypersurface in this family, `b_2(X) = 1`.\n*   **Careful Point 2:** We must check if our specific polynomial (with the typo removed) defines a generic hypersurface. A hypersurface is non-generic if its defining polynomial vanishes identically on some subvariety of the ambient space. This can increase `b_2(X)`.\n*   Let's check the corrected polynomial `f_corr = z_1^8z_3 + z_1z_2^7 + z_1z_2z_3z_4z_5 + z_2z_3^4 + z_4^3z_5 + z_5^3`.\n*   Consider the projective line `P(22, 50)` within `WCP^4`, which is defined by setting `z_2 = 0`, `z_3 = 0`, and `z_5 = 0`.\n*   Substituting these conditions into `f_corr`: `f_corr(z_1, 0, 0, z_4, 0) = 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 0`.\n*   Since the polynomial vanishes identically on this line, the entire line `P(22, 50)` is contained within the Calabi-Yau threefold `X`.\n*   This contained subvariety provides an additional algebraic cycle in the homology of `X`, independent of the hyperplane class. This increases the second Betti number.\n*   Therefore, `b_2(X) = b_2(\\text{generic}) + (\\text{extra cycles}) = 1 + 1 = 2`.\n\n**7. Calculate the final invariant:**\nUsing the formula from Step 5 and the result from Step 6:\n*   `b_2(K) = b_2(X) - 1`\n*   `b_2(K) = 2 - 1 = 1`\n\nThe Crawley-Nordström invariant for the specified Calabi-Yau Link is 1."
