    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the name of the value computed between heartbeats for HRV analysis.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core concept of Heart Rate Variability (HRV)**\nHRV is not a measure of the heart rate itself, but rather the variability or fluctuation in the time intervals between adjacent heartbeats. A high HRV generally indicates a healthy, adaptable autonomic nervous system, while a low HRV can be a sign of stress or health issues.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the fundamental measurement**\nTo calculate this variability, one must first measure the precise time elapsed between each successive heartbeat. This measurement is the fundamental data point from which all HRV metrics are derived. The user's question is asking for the name of this specific measurement.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the gold standard source: ECG**\nHistorically and clinically, the gold standard for measuring heart activity is the electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG). An ECG waveform has distinct peaks and troughs labeled P, Q, R, S, and T. The most prominent and easily identifiable peak is the 'R' wave, which corresponds to the main electrical impulse of ventricular contraction. Therefore, the time interval between two consecutive heartbeats is most accurately measured as the time between two successive R waves. This is called the **R-R interval**.\n\n**Step 4: Relate the concept to the user's specified technology: PPG**\nThe question states that the measurement is taken using Photoplethysmography (PPG). PPG does not measure the heart's electrical activity; instead, it detects changes in blood volume in the peripheral circulation (like a fingertip or wrist) as blood is pumped with each heartbeat.\n*   The time between the peaks of the PPG waveform is called the **Pulse-to-Pulse Interval (PPI)** or more generally, the **Inter-beat Interval (IBI)**.\n*   **Crucial Point:** Although the technology is different (PPG vs. ECG), the physiological event it tracks is the same cardiac cycle. Because HRV research and terminology were established using ECG, the term **R-R interval** is very commonly and often used as a synonym for IBI or PPI, even when the data is sourced from a PPG device. It has become the standard term in the field for the beat-to-beat interval, regardless of the capture method.\n\n**Step 5: Consider data processing for HRV analysis**\nFor accurate HRV calculations, it's important to use only \"normal\" heartbeats. Raw R-R intervals can be affected by arrhythmias (abnormal heartbeats) or measurement errors (artifacts). Therefore, the data is often filtered to exclude these irregularities. The resulting cleaned-up intervals, which represent the time between two consecutive normal sinus beats, are called **Normal-to-Normal (NN) intervals**. While this is a very precise term for the data *used* in the final calculation, the fundamental measurement *before* filtering is still the R-R interval or IBI.\n\n### Conclusion of Analysis\n\nBased on the analysis, there are several technically correct terms:\n*   **Inter-beat Interval (IBI):** A general and accurate term.\n*   **Pulse-to-Pulse Interval (PPI):** Specific to pulse-based measurements like PPG.\n*   **R-R Interval (RRI):** The most common and widely understood term in the entire field of HRV, originating from ECG but now used more broadly.\n*   **Normal-to-Normal Interval (NN Interval):** The term for the filtered data specifically used for HRV calculation.\n\nGiven the context of HRV, the most common and universally recognized name for the value measured between heartbeats is the **R-R interval**.\n\n<<<R-R interval>>>"
