    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the area of the smallest square that encloses the given figure.\n\n**Step 1: Understand and analyze the first part of the curve.**\nThe curve is defined piece-wise. For the interval $t \\in [0, \\pi]$, the parametric equations are:\n$x = \\cos t$\n$y = \\sin t$ (since $b=1$)\n\n*   This is the standard parametrization for the upper half of a unit circle centered at the origin.\n*   To find the extent of this part of the figure, we evaluate the ranges of $x$ and $y$.\n*   As $t$ goes from $0$ to $\\pi$, $x = \\cos t$ goes from $\\cos(0)=1$ to $\\cos(\\pi)=-1$. The range of $x$ is $[-1, 1]$.\n*   As $t$ goes from $0$ to $\\pi$, $y = \\sin t$ goes from $\\sin(0)=0$ up to $\\sin(\\pi/2)=1$ and back down to $\\sin(\\pi)=0$. The range of $y$ is $[0, 1]$.\n\n**Step 2: Understand and analyze the second part of the curve.**\nFor the interval $t \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$, the parametric equations are:\n$x = \\cos t$\n$y = 5\\sin t$ (since $b=5$)\n\n*   These equations describe an ellipse. We can see this by noting that $x^2 + (y/5)^2 = \\cos^2 t + \\sin^2 t = 1$. This is the equation of an ellipse centered at the origin with a horizontal semi-axis of 1 and a vertical semi-axis of 5.\n*   The interval for $t$ is $(\\pi, 2\\pi)$, which means we are only tracing a part of this ellipse.\n*   As $t$ goes from $\\pi$ to $2\\pi$, $x = \\cos t$ goes from $\\cos(\\pi)=-1$ to $\\cos(2\\pi)=1$. The range of $x$ is $[-1, 1]$.\n*   As $t$ goes from $\\pi$ to $2\\pi$, $\\sin t$ is negative. It goes from $\\sin(\\pi)=0$ down to $\\sin(3\\pi/2)=-1$ and back up to $\\sin(2\\pi)=0$. Therefore, $y = 5\\sin t$ goes from $0$ down to $-5$ and back to $0$. The range of $y$ is $[-5, 0]$. This corresponds to the lower half of the ellipse.\n\n**Step 3: Combine the two parts to find the overall dimensions of the figure.**\nNow, we combine the ranges from both parts to find the maximum extent of the entire figure.\n\n*   **X-dimension (Width):** The range of $x$ for the first part is $[-1, 1]$ and for the second part is $[-1, 1]$. Therefore, the overall minimum $x$ is $x_{min} = -1$ and the maximum $x$ is $x_{max} = 1$. The total width of the figure is $W = x_{max} - x_{min} = 1 - (-1) = 2$.\n*   **Y-dimension (Height):** The range of $y$ for the first part is $[0, 1]$. The range of $y$ for the second part is $[-5, 0]$. Combining these, the overall minimum $y$ is $y_{min} = -5$ and the maximum $y$ is $y_{max} = 1$. The total height of the figure is $H = y_{max} - y_{min} = 1 - (-5) = 6$.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the side length of the smallest enclosing square.**\nAn \"outcircling\" or enclosing square must be large enough to contain the entire figure. The smallest such square will have a side length equal to the larger of the figure's width and height.\n\n*   Width of the figure = 2.\n*   Height of the figure = 6.\n*   The side length of the smallest enclosing square must be at least $\\max(2, 6) = 6$.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the area of the square.**\nThe area of a square is the side length squared.\n\n*   Side length = 6.\n*   Area = $6^2 = 36$.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n1.  Recognize the piecewise nature of the parameter $b$. The curve is composed of two different shapes joined together.\n2.  Correctly identify the ranges of $x$ and $y$ for each segment by considering the given interval for the parameter $t$.\n3.  The overall dimension of the composite figure is determined by the absolute minimum and maximum values of $x$ and $y$ over the entire path.\n4.  The side length of the smallest enclosing square is the maximum of the figure's total width and total height.\n\n<<<36>>>"
