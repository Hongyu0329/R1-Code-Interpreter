    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct film.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the question into key elements.**\nTo find the correct movie, we need to identify one that satisfies all of the following specific criteria:\n1.  It must be a **Hollywood feature film**.\n2.  It must be produced by a **major film studio**.\n3.  The scene must involve a **teenager** (or a character in early adolescence who fits that role).\n4.  This character must be riding a **pink bike**. This is a very specific visual clue.\n5.  The character must **pedal directly toward an oncoming car**. This describes the central action of the scene, likely a dare or a moment of defiance.\n\n**Step 2: Brainstorm potential films and eliminate incorrect ones.**\n*   ***It* (2017):** This film features teenagers, bikes, and confrontations with bullies and cars. However, none of the main characters' signature bikes are pink. This film does not match.\n*   ***Footloose* (1984):** This film features a famous scene where teenagers play a game of \"chicken.\" However, the scene involves two tractors driving toward each other, not a bike and a car. This film does not match.\n*   ***Pee-wee's Big Adventure* (1985):** This film is famous for a bike, but the bike is red and custom-built, not pink. Also, the protagonist is a man-child, not a teenager. This film does not match.\n\n**Step 3: Focus on the most distinctive clues: the \"pink bike\" and the \"oncoming car.\"**\nThe combination of a pink bike, a young protagonist, and a game of chicken with a car points strongly to a coming-of-age story, likely set in a previous decade. This specific set of visuals is quite memorable.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the correct film that matches all criteria.**\nThe film that features this exact scene is **Now and Then (1995)**.\n*   **Hollywood feature film / Major Studio:** It was produced and distributed by New Line Cinema, a major studio.\n*   **Teenager:** The story's main events are a flashback to the summer of 1970, when the four main characters are 12 years old. In the context of a coming-of-age story, the character of Samantha fits the \"young teenager/adolescent\" requirement.\n*   **Pink Bike:** The character Samantha Albertson (played by Gaby Hoffmann) rides a very distinct pink bicycle with a banana seat.\n*   **Pedals toward an oncoming car:** In a key scene, the local bullies (the Wormer brothers) dare Samantha to prove she isn't scared. She accepts the dare, gets on her pink bike, and pedals head-on into the path of an approaching car, swerving away just in time to avoid being hit. This perfectly matches the question's description.\n\n**Step 5: Final Confirmation.**\nThe scene from *Now and Then* aligns with every single point in the query, making it the correct answer.\n\n<<<Now and Then>>>"
