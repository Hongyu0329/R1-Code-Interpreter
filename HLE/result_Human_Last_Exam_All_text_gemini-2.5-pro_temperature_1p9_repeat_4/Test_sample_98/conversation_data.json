    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the object and its orientation.**\nThe tank has the shape of a regular icosahedron. A regular icosahedron is a Platonic solid with 20 identical equilateral triangular faces, 30 edges, and 12 vertices. A key property of the icosahedron is that it has a center of symmetry. The tank is \"standing on one of its faces,\" which means one of its 20 triangular faces is horizontal and serves as the base.\n\n**Step 2: Interpret the \"half-filled\" condition.**\n\"Half-filled with water\" means the volume of the water is exactly half the total volume of the icosahedron tank. Due to gravity, the water will settle at the bottom, and its surface will be a horizontal plane.\n\n**Step 3: Relate the water level to the geometry of the icosahedron.**\nBecause a regular icosahedron has a center of symmetry, a plane that divides its volume into two equal halves must pass through this center of symmetry. Since the water surface is a horizontal plane and it divides the volume in half, the water surface must be a horizontal plane passing exactly through the center of the icosahedron.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the shape of the water surface.**\nThe question \"what is the shape of the water surface\" is asking for the shape of the two-dimensional cross-section created by the intersection of this horizontal plane with the inner walls of the icosahedron tank. So, the problem is reduced to finding the shape of the cross-section of an icosahedron when it is sliced by a plane that passes through its center and is parallel to one of its faces.\n\n**Step 5: Analyze the cross-section using symmetry.**\n*   **Rotational Symmetry:** When an icosahedron rests on a face, the axis passing through the center of the base face and the center of the opposite top face is an axis of 3-fold rotational symmetry. The water surface is a horizontal plane, which is perpendicular to this vertical axis. Therefore, the resulting cross-sectional shape must also have 3-fold rotational symmetry.\n*   **Central Symmetry:** As established in Step 3, the slicing plane passes through the center of symmetry of the icosahedron. This means the resulting cross-section must also be centrally symmetric.\n*   **Finding the number of sides:** The plane passing through the center divides the 12 vertices of the icosahedron into two groups: 6 vertices above the plane and 6 vertices below it. The cross-section is a polygon whose vertices are the points where the plane intersects the edges of the icosahedron. An edge is intersected if and only if one of its endpoints is above the plane and the other is below. There are exactly six such edges forming a \"waist\" or \"equator\" around the middle of the icosahedron. Therefore, the resulting polygon has 6 vertices and 6 sides.\n*   **Conclusion on the shape:** A 6-sided polygon that possesses both 3-fold rotational symmetry and central symmetry must be a **regular hexagon**. The lengths of all sides are equal, and all internal angles are equal (120 degrees).\n\n**Summary of careful points:**\n1.  Recognize that \"half-filled\" in a centrally symmetric object implies the dividing surface passes through the center of symmetry.\n2.  Identify the orientation correctly: \"standing on a face\" means the slicing plane is parallel to a pair of opposite faces.\n3.  Use the symmetry properties of the icosahedron (3-fold rotation and central symmetry) to determine the properties of the resulting cross-section.\n4.  Correctly deduce that the cross-section will have 6 vertices because the plane cuts the 6 \"equatorial\" edges that connect the upper half to the lower half.\n\nCombining these points, the shape of the water surface is a regular hexagon.\n\n<<<A regular hexagon>>>"
