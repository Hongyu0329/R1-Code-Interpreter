    "**Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to find the greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of two given polynomial matrices, P1(s) and P2(s).\n\nP1(s) = [[s^2 + s, -s],\n         [-s^2 - 1, s^2]]\n\nP2(s) = [[s, 0],\n         [-s - 1, 1]]\n\n**2. Definition of GCRD**\n- A polynomial matrix R(s) is a **right divisor** of P(s) if P(s) = Q(s)R(s) for some polynomial matrix Q(s).\n- R(s) is a **common right divisor** of P1(s) and P2(s) if it is a right divisor of both.\n- A common right divisor G(s) is a **greatest common right divisor (GCRD)** if any other common right divisor D(s) is a right divisor of G(s) (i.e., G(s) = H(s)D(s) for some polynomial matrix H(s)).\n- A GCRD is not unique. If G(s) is a GCRD, then U(s)G(s) is also a GCRD, where U(s) is any unimodular matrix (a polynomial matrix whose determinant is a non-zero constant).\n\n**3. Method: Euclidean Algorithm for Polynomial Matrices**\nA standard method to find the GCRD is to use elementary row operations on a stacked matrix formed by P1 and P2. The goal is to reduce this matrix to a simpler form where the non-zero rows constitute the GCRD.\n\n**4. Form the Stacked Matrix**\nLet's form the matrix M(s) by stacking P1(s) on top of P2(s):\nM(s) =\n[R1]   [[s^2 + s, -s],\n[R2]    [-s^2 - 1, s^2],\n[R3]    [s,       0],\n[R4]    [-s - 1,  1]]\n\n**5. Perform Elementary Row Operations**\nThe allowed elementary row operations are:\ni. Swapping two rows.\nii. Multiplying a row by a non-zero constant.\niii. Adding a polynomial multiple of one row to another row (e.g., Ri -> Ri + p(s)*Rj).\n\nLet's perform the reduction:\n\n*   **Initial Matrix:**\n    M(s) =\n    [[s^2 + s,  -s    ]   (R1)\n     [-s^2 - 1, s^2   ]   (R2)\n     [s,        0     ]   (R3)\n     [-s - 1,   1     ]]  (R4)\n\n*   **Step 1:** Use R3 and R4 to simplify other rows. We'll aim to create zeros in the first column.\n    *   Perform R1 -> R1 - (s+1) * R3:\n        [s^2+s - s(s+1), -s - 0] = [0, -s]\n    *   Perform R2 -> R2 + (s) * R3 is not helpful yet.\n    *   Perform R4 -> R4 + R3:\n        [-s-1+s, 1+0] = [-1, 1]\n    *   The matrix becomes:\n        [[0,        -s  ]\n         [-s^2 - 1, s^2 ]\n         [s,        0   ]\n         [-1,       1   ]]\n\n*   **Step 2:** Use the new rows to simplify further.\n    *   Let's use the new R4 = [-1, 1] to create a zero in the first column of R3 and R2.\n    *   Perform R3 -> R3 + s * R4:\n        [s + s(-1), 0 + s(1)] = [0, s]\n    *   Perform R2 -> R2 - (s^2+1) * R4:\n        [-s^2-1 - (s^2+1)(-1), s^2 - (s^2+1)(1)] = [0, s^2 - s^2 - 1] = [0, -1]\n    *   The matrix becomes:\n        [[0, -s]\n         [0, -1]\n         [0,  s]\n         [-1, 1]]\n\n*   **Step 3:** We have several rows with the first element being zero. We can simplify them.\n    *   Use the row [0, -1] (or [0, 1] by multiplying by -1) to eliminate the second element in other rows. Let's use R2_new = [0, -1].\n    *   Perform R1 -> R1 - s * R2_new:\n        [0, -s - s(-1)] = [0, 0]\n    *   Perform R3 -> R3 + s * R2_new:\n        [0, s + s(-1)] = [0, 0]\n    *   The matrix becomes:\n        [[0,  0 ]\n         [0, -1 ]\n         [0,  0 ]\n         [-1, 1 ]]\n\n*   **Step 4:** The non-zero rows are [0, -1] and [-1, 1]. Let's simplify the last row using the second row.\n    *   Let's use R2' = [0, -1]. Perform R4 -> R4 + R2':\n        [-1+0, 1+(-1)] = [-1, 0]\n    *   The matrix becomes:\n        [[0,   0]\n         [0,  -1]\n         [0,   0]\n         [-1,  0]]\n\n**6. Identify the GCRD**\nThe elementary row operations have reduced the row space of M(s) to be spanned by the rows [-1, 0] and [0, -1]. We can arrange these rows into a 2x2 matrix which is a GCRD. Let's reorder them and negate the rows (which is equivalent to multiplying by a unimodular matrix) to get a simpler form.\nG(s) = [[-1, 0], [0, -1]] -> Multiplying by [[-1, 0], [0, -1]] gives [[1, 0], [0, 1]].\nThe GCRD is [[1, 0], [0, 1]], which is the identity matrix I.\n\n**7. Verify the Result**\n- **Is it a common right divisor?**\n    - P1(s) = Q1(s) * I(s). We can choose Q1(s) = P1(s), which is a polynomial matrix. So, I is a right divisor of P1.\n    - P2(s) = Q2(s) * I(s). We can choose Q2(s) = P2(s), which is a polynomial matrix. So, I is a right divisor of P2.\n    - Thus, I is a common right divisor.\n\n- **Is it the *greatest* common right divisor?**\n    - The Euclidean algorithm guarantees that the result is a GCRD. When the GCRD is a unimodular matrix (like I, since det(I) = 1, a non-zero constant), the original matrices are called **right coprime**.\n    - The Bezout identity states that the GCRD can be expressed as G(s) = X(s)P1(s) + Y(s)P2(s). Our procedure proves that such X(s) and Y(s) exist for G(s) = I. If any other D(s) is a common right divisor, then P1=A1*D and P2=A2*D. Substituting into the Bezout identity gives I = (X*A1 + Y*A2)*D, which proves that D(s) is a right divisor of I. Therefore, I is a greatest common right divisor.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe greatest common right divisor of P1(s) and P2(s) is the 2x2 identity matrix.\n\n<<<[[1, 0], [0, 1]]>>>"
