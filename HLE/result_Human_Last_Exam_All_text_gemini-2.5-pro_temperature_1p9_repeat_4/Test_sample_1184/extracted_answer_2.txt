Based on an analysis of conserved protein structures and functional studies, the key residues in the human beta-1 subunit (CavÎ²1, UniProt: P54283) are as follows:

**1) Residues that are hotspots for interaction (binding) with the alpha-1 subunit:**

These residues are located in the Guanylate Kinase-like (GK) domain and form the Alpha-Binding Pocket (ABP) which directly contacts the alpha-1 subunit's Alpha Interaction Domain (AID). The most critical are:

*   **Val333 (Valine at position 333)**
*   **Tyr368 (Tyrosine at position 368)**
*   **Asp392 (Aspartic Acid at position 392)**
*   **Trp395 (Tryptophan at position 395)**: This is considered the single most critical residue for the interaction.
*   **Met441 (Methionine at position 441)**
*   **Ala442 (Alanine at position 442)**

**2) Residues/domains that are hotspots for fine-tuning gating properties (gating modulation):**

These sites are crucial for the allosteric regulation of the alpha-1 subunit's function after binding has occurred.

*   **N-Terminal Domain (approximately residues 1-70):** This entire flexible region is a major hotspot that dictates the kinetics of channel inactivation.
*   **Hook Region (approximately residues 245-296):** This linker region between the SH3 and GK domains influences overall gating modulation.
*   **Lys405 (Lysine at position 405):** This specific surface residue on the GK domain is a key hotspot for modulating the voltage-dependence of channel activation, acting as a secondary contact point with the alpha-1 subunit that is distinct from the primary binding interaction.
