    "An analysis of the user's request is as follows.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Question\n\nThe problem asks us to take a string representing a sum of numbers (e.g., \"3+2+1+4\") and rearrange the numbers so they are in non-decreasing order. The numbers involved are exclusively 1, 2, 3, and 4. The final output must be a string in the same sum format (e.g., \"1+2+3+4\"). A critical part of the request is to design the *most memory-efficient* C program for this task and calculate the total memory used by its variables.\n\n### List of Careful Points\n\n1.  **Input Data Range:** The numbers are limited to 1, 2, 3, and 4. This is a very important constraint that suggests a specialized sorting method like Counting Sort is highly effective.\n2.  **Memory Efficiency:** This is the primary optimization goal. A solution that allocates memory based on the maximum input size (1000 characters) will not be optimal. The ideal solution should use a small, constant amount of memory.\n3.  **Input/Output Format:** The input and output are strings, not numerical values. The format is `number+number+...+number`. We must handle the '+' separators correctly, ensuring no plus sign appears at the end of the output string.\n4.  **No Need for Large Buffers:** To be memory-efficient, we should avoid reading the entire input string into a character array (e.g., `char s[1001];`). Instead, processing the input character by character is preferable.\n\n### Step-by-Step Derivation of the Final Answer\n\nA memory-inefficient approach would be to read the entire string into a buffer, extract the numbers into an integer array, sort the array, and then reconstruct the output string. This would require over 1KB for the string buffer alone.\n\nThe most memory-efficient approach leverages the constraint on the number set {1, 2, 3, 4} and processes the input on-the-fly.\n\n1.  **Algorithm Selection:** We will use a counting-based approach. Instead of storing the numbers themselves, we will only count the occurrences of each number (1, 2, 3, and 4).\n\n2.  **Input Processing:** To minimize memory, we will not store the input string. We can read it character by character using `getchar()` until a newline or end-of-file character is encountered.\n\n3.  **Counting:**\n    *   We declare four integer variables to store the counts of '1's, '2's, '3's, and '4's respectively (e.g., `count1`, `count2`, `count3`, `count4`).\n    *   We also need a single `char` variable to hold the character currently being read from the input stream.\n    *   As we read each character, we check if it's a '1', '2', '3', or '4' and increment the corresponding counter. The '+' characters are ignored.\n\n4.  **Output Generation:**\n    *   After counting, we generate the output string.\n    *   To correctly place the '+' separators, we use a flag variable. A `char` is sufficient and more memory-efficient than an `int` for a boolean flag. Let's call it `first_flag`.\n    *   We then print the numbers in sorted order. We first print all the '1's based on `count1`, then all the '2's based on `count2`, and so on.\n    *   For each number printed, we first check `first_flag`. If it's not the first number, we print a '+' before the digit. Then we print the digit and update the flag.\n\n5.  **Memory Calculation:**\n    To find the total memory `m` used for the variables in this problem, we sum the sizes of all declared variables. We assume a common environment where `sizeof(int)` is 4 bytes and `sizeof(char)` is 1 byte.\n\n    *   `int count1;` -> 4 bytes\n    *   `int count2;` -> 4 bytes\n    *   `int count3;` -> 4 bytes\n    *   `int count4;` -> 4 bytes\n    *   `char input_char;` (for `getchar()`) -> 1 byte\n    *   `char first_flag;` (to manage printing of '+') -> 1 byte\n\n    Total Memory `m` = (4 + 4 + 4 + 4) + 1 + 1 = 18 bytes.\n\nThis approach uses a fixed, small amount of memory, making it maximally efficient for the given problem constraints.\n\n<<<18>>>"
