    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction to determine the final product.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Starting Material and Reagents**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide.\n    *   This is an aromatic compound (a derivative of benzene).\n    *   The primary functional group is a tertiary amide: `-C(=O)N(CH2CH3)2`. This is at position 1 of the benzene ring.\n    *   There is a second substituent, a dimethylamino group: `-N(CH3)2`. This is at position 3 (meta) relative to the amide group.\n\n    The structure is:\n    ```\n          O\n         //\n        C - N(Et)2  (position 1)\n       /\n      / \\\n    (H)C---C---C(H)\n       ||  |  ||\n      (H)C---C---C-N(Me)2  (position 3)\n           \\ /\n           (H)\n    ```\n\n*   **Reagents (Step 1):** sec-BuLi and TMEDA in THF.\n    *   **sec-BuLi (sec-butyllithium):** This is a very strong organometallic base. Its primary function in this context is to deprotonate a C-H bond on the aromatic ring, a process called lithiation.\n    *   **TMEDA (N,N,N',N'-tetramethylethylenediamine):** This is a chelating agent for the lithium cation (Li+). It breaks down the aggregates of sec-BuLi and increases its basicity and reactivity. TMEDA is crucial for facilitating a reaction known as *Directed ortho-Metalation* (DoM).\n    *   **THF (tetrahydrofuran):** This is the polar aprotic solvent for the reaction.\n\n*   **Reagent (Step 2):** Methyl iodide (CH3I).\n    *   This is a classic electrophile used in alkylation reactions. The C-I bond is polarized, making the methyl group electrophilic and a target for nucleophiles.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the First Reaction (Directed ortho-Metalation)**\n\nThis reaction is a Directed ortho-Metalation (DoM). In this process, a substituent on the benzene ring (a \"directing group\") coordinates to the lithium ion of the sec-BuLi. This brings the base into close proximity to a C-H bond at a position *ortho* (adjacent) to the directing group, facilitating its deprotonation.\n\n*   **Identifying the Directing Groups:** The starting material has two potential directing groups that can coordinate with Li+:\n    1.  The N,N-diethylamide group (`-CONEt2`) at position 1. The carbonyl oxygen is an excellent Lewis base.\n    2.  The dimethylamino group (`-NMe2`) at position 3. The nitrogen lone pair is a Lewis base.\n\n*   **Determining Regioselectivity (Where does the lithiation occur?):**\n    1.  **Compare Directing Group Strength:** The directing ability of functional groups has been well-established. The tertiary amide (`-CONR2`) is one of the most powerful directing groups, significantly stronger than the amino group (`-NR2`). Therefore, the lithiation will be primarily controlled by the amide group.\n    2.  **Identify ortho Positions:** The amide group at position 1 will direct lithiation to its ortho positions, which are C-2 and C-6.\n    3.  **Consider the Influence of the Second Substituent:** The dimethylamino group at position 3 also has a directing effect. It directs lithiation to its own ortho positions, which are C-2 and C-4.\n    4.  **Reinforcing Effect:** Notice that both the strong directing group (amide) and the weaker directing group (amino) point towards the C-2 position. This is known as a reinforcing effect. The C-2 proton is significantly more acidic than any other proton on the ring due to this cooperative activation. The lithiation will occur selectively and exclusively at the C-2 position.\n\n*   **Intermediate Product:** After reaction with sec-BuLi/TMEDA, a lithium atom replaces the hydrogen at C-2, forming an aryllithium intermediate: 2-lithio-N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide. This species is a potent carbon-based nucleophile.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Second Reaction (Electrophilic Quench)**\n\nThe nucleophilic aryllithium intermediate is then reacted with the electrophile, methyl iodide (CH3I).\n\n*   **Reaction Mechanism:** The carbanion at C-2 of the benzene ring attacks the electrophilic methyl group of CH3I. This is a nucleophilic substitution reaction (specifically, SN2-like), forming a new carbon-carbon bond and displacing iodide (I-) as the leaving group.\n\n*   **Final Product Formation:** A methyl group (`-CH3`) is attached to the C-2 position of the benzene ring.\n\n### **Step 4: Determine the Final Compound**\n\nStarting with N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide, the reaction introduces a methyl group at the C-2 position.\n\nThe structure of the final product is:\n```\n      O\n     //\n    C - N(Et)2\n   /\n  / \\\n(Me)C---C---C(H)\n   ||  |  ||\n  (H)C---C---C-N(Me)2\n       \\ /\n       (H)\n```\n\nThe name of this compound is **N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide**.\n\n<<<N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide>>>"
