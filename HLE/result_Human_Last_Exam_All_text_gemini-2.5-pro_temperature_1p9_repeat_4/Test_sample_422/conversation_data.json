    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question, leading to the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Premise**\nThe question sets up a specific philosophical scenario with three key components:\n1.  **The JTB Definition of Knowledge:** Knowledge is defined as a Justified True Belief (S knows P iff P is true, S believes P, and S is justified in believing P).\n2.  **Constrained Epistemic States:** The only available states for an individual are **Knowledge** and **Belief**. This is a crucial simplification. Components like \"Justification\" or \"Truth\" are conditions for knowledge, not standalone epistemic states the agent can possess.\n3.  **Exclusion:** We must ignore **Gettier problems**. Gettier problems demonstrate that JTB is not a *sufficient* condition for knowledge (i.e., you can have a JTB that isn't knowledge). The question asks for problems the theory *runs into*, which is a broader scope that can include problems with its internal coherence or applicability, not just its sufficiency.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the \"Justification\" (J) Condition**\nThe JTB theory requires a belief to be justified to count as knowledge. This immediately raises the question: what justifies a belief? In our simplified world, a justifier must be either another Belief or an instance of Knowledge.\n\n*   **Case A: Justification by Belief:** If Belief A is justified by Belief B, then for the justification to be strong, Belief B must also be justified. This leads to a chain: Belief B needs justification from Belief C, C from D, and so on. This creates the classic **Regress Problem of Justification** (also known as the Agrippan Trilemma):\n    1.  **Infinite Regress:** The chain of justifications goes on forever, never reaching a foundation.\n    2.  **Circularity:** The chain of justifications eventually circles back on itself (e.g., A is justified by B, which is justified by C, which is justified by A).\n    3.  **Dogmatism:** The chain stops at an unjustified belief that is accepted as a foundational axiom.\n\n*   **Case B: Justification by Knowledge:** If Belief A is justified by Knowledge K1, this seems more promising. However, according to the JTB definition itself, K1 must be a Justified True Belief. To establish that K1 is knowledge, we need to show it has its own justification, K2. This reasoning simply pushes the regress problem back a step, starting a chain of required knowledge (K1 requires K2, which requires K3, etc.).\n\n**Conclusion for Point 1:** The \"Justification\" requirement leads to an inescapable regress or circularity problem. The theory demands justification but provides no ultimate, non-problematic source for it within the constrained system of only Beliefs and Knowledge. This is our first major problem.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the \"Truth\" (T) Condition**\nThe JTB theory requires the belief to be *true*. \"Truth\" is a condition about the external world; it relates the belief to objective reality. The problem here is how the agent can ever confirm that this condition is met.\n\n*   An agent has beliefs and justifications for those beliefs (which are internal to the agent). However, the agent has no direct, unmediated access to \"Truth\" itself.\n*   To verify that a belief P is true, the agent must engage in some processâ€”checking evidence, making observations, running tests. Any such process results in the agent forming a *new belief*: the belief that \"P is true.\"\n*   Let's call the original belief B1 (\"the cat is on the mat\"). To check if B1 is knowledge, the agent must check if it's true. This check results in a new belief, B2 (\"I have seen the cat on the mat, so I believe B1 is true\").\n*   According to JTB, to *know* that B1 is true, this new belief (B2) would itself have to be a piece of knowledge. But for B2 to be knowledge, it must also be a Justified *True* Belief. This requires the agent to step outside the system again to verify the truth of B2.\n\n**Conclusion for Point 2:** This creates a problem of **circularity or unverifiability**. To confirm that a belief meets the \"Truth\" condition for knowledge, one seemingly has to already possess knowledge. The agent is trapped within their own beliefs and can never be certain that their belief corresponds to the external truth. They can only have a very strongly justified *belief* that it's true, but this doesn't bridge the gap to the objective \"Truth\" required by the JTB definition. This is our second major problem.\n\n### Careful Points Listed\n*   The analysis must strictly adhere to the defined world where only \"Knowledge\" and \"Belief\" are states.\n*   The problems identified must be distinct from Gettier problems, which focus on the insufficiency of JTB, not its internal coherence.\n*   Problem 1 (Regress of Justification) is about how to ground the \"J\" condition.\n*   Problem 2 (Access to Truth) is about how an agent can ever verify the \"T\" condition.\n\n### Final Answer Acquisition\nBased on the analysis, the two problems that the JTB theory runs into under the specified constraints are:\n\n1.  **The Regress Problem of Justification:** The requirement for a belief to be \"justified\" creates an infinite regress or circular loop, as every justifier must itself be a justified belief or knowledge, which in turn requires justification.\n2.  **The Problem of Accessing Truth (Circularity of Knowledge):** The \"Truth\" condition is external to the agent. For an agent to verify that their belief is true, they can only form another justified belief. This makes it impossible for the agent to ever independently confirm the \"Truth\" condition without presupposing the very knowledge they are trying to establish.\n\n<<<\n1. **The Regress Problem of Justification:** The requirement that a belief must be justified leads to an infinite regress. If a belief must be justified by another belief or by a piece of knowledge, that justifier must itself be justified. This creates an endless chain of justifications with no ultimate foundation, or it leads to circular reasoning.\n\n2. **The Problem of Accessing Truth:** The condition that a belief must be \"true\" is problematic because an agent has no way to step outside of their own belief system to confirm a belief's correspondence with objective truth. Any attempt to verify the truth of a belief only results in forming another justified belief, creating a circular problem where one must already \"know\" a belief is true to meet the criteria for knowledge.\n>>>"
