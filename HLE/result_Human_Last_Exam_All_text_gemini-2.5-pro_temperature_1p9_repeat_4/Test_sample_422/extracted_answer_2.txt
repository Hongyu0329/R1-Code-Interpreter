1. **The Regress Problem of Justification:** The requirement that a belief must be justified leads to an infinite regress. If a belief must be justified by another belief or by a piece of knowledge, that justifier must itself be justified. This creates an endless chain of justifications with no ultimate foundation, or it leads to circular reasoning.

2. **The Problem of Accessing Truth:** The condition that a belief must be "true" is problematic because an agent has no way to step outside of their own belief system to confirm a belief's correspondence with objective truth. Any attempt to verify the truth of a belief only results in forming another justified belief, creating a circular problem where one must already "know" a belief is true to meet the criteria for knowledge.
