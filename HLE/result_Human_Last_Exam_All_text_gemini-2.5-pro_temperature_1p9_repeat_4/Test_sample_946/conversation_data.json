    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n### Analysis of the Question\nThe question asks for the name of a specific fictional singer. The key details to break down are:\n1.  **Source:** The online cartoon series \"Homestar Runner\".\n2.  **Specific Episode:** \"Teen Girl Squad #15\".\n3.  **Setting/Event:** The Junior prom.\n4.  **Performer Type:** A cardboard cutout.\n5.  **Subject:** A fictional singer (or band).\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n*   **Episode Accuracy:** The information must come specifically from \"Teen Girl Squad #15\" and not any other episode.\n*   **Fictional Character:** The answer must be a character from within the Homestar Runner universe, not a real-world musician.\n*   **The \"Cardboard Cutout\" Detail:** The fact that it's a cardboard cutout is a crucial part of the gag in the episode and must be considered. It's not a live performance.\n*   **\"Singer\" vs. \"Band\":** The question says \"singer,\" but in the Homestar Runner universe, sometimes a band name is used to refer to the group's musical act. The cutout is of a single person, the lead singer, but is credited under the band's name.\n\n### Step-by-Step Acquisition of the Answer\n1.  The episode \"Teen Girl Squad #15\", also known by its title card \"Sweet Someteen\", revolves around the girls going to their Junior Prom.\n2.  We need to examine the scene at the prom to identify the musical entertainment.\n3.  In the school gymnasium where the prom is held, there is a stage set up.\n4.  On the stage, instead of a live band, there is a single cardboard cutout of a long-haired musician in a rock/metal pose.\n5.  The cartoon's own scrawled narration appears on the screen, captioning the scene.\n6.  This caption explicitly states: \"musical stylings by a cardboard cutout of **TARANCHULA**\".\n7.  \"Taranchula\" is a fictional hair metal band within the Homestar Runner world, known for songs like \"Trudgemank\" and for being Cheerleader's favorite band. The cutout represents the lead singer of this band.\n8.  Therefore, the name of the fictional musical act represented by the cardboard cutout is Taranchula.\n\n<<<Taranchula>>>"
