    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the historical linguistic development.\n\n### **Step 1: Proto-Indo-European to Proto-Germanic**\n\n1.  **Identify the Root and Form:** The Proto-Indo-European (PIE) form is `*seh₂g-ieti`. The root is `*seh₂g-`. The `*h₂` is a laryngeal consonant. The form is a 3rd person singular present indicative with a `*-ye/yo-` suffix. The provided cognates, Hittite `sākizzi` and Latin `sāgīre`, confirm this root.\n2.  **Laryngeal Effect on Vowel:** The laryngeal `*h₂` colors an adjacent `*e` vowel to `*a`. The PIE form `*seh₂g-` thus becomes pre-Proto-Germanic `*sāg-`. The long vowel `*ā` is suggested by the long vowel in the Latin cognate `sāgīre`.\n3.  **Grimm's Law:** This is the First Germanic Sound Shift. The relevant change here is for the voiced velar stop `*g`, which becomes a voiceless velar stop `*k`. So, `*sāg-` becomes `*sāk-`. (Verner's Law does not apply here because the consonant derived from `*g` is `*k`, not a voiceless fricative, which is what Verner's Law would affect).\n4.  **Germanic Vowel Shift:** In Proto-Germanic (PGmc), PIE `*ā` and PIE `*ō` merge into PGmc `*ō`. Therefore, the pre-PGmc root `*sāk-` becomes the PGmc root `*sōk-`.\n5.  **Verb Class and Ending:** The PIE suffix `*-ye/yo-` typically forms weak Class 1 verbs in Germanic. The PGmc stem is therefore `*sōki-` or `*sōkja-`. The 3rd person singular present indicative ending in PIE, `*-ti`, becomes `*-þi` in PGmc (later simplified to `*-þ` after unstressed `i`).\n6.  **Final Proto-Germanic Form:** Combining the stem `*sōki-` and the ending `*-þ` gives the PGmc 3rd person singular present indicative form `*sōkiþ`.\n\n### **Step 2: Proto-Germanic to Old Norse**\n\n1.  **Starting Form:** PGmc `*sōkiþ`.\n2.  **i-Umlaut (i-Mutation):** The `*i` or `*j` in the stem `*sōki-` triggers a fronting and raising of the back root vowel `*ō`. In Old Norse (ON), the i-umlaut of `*ō` is `ǿ` (a long, fronted, rounded vowel). So, the stem `sōk-` becomes `sǿk-`.\n3.  **Ending:** The PGmc ending `*-iþ` would normally lose its final consonant in Proto-Norse. However, the 3rd person singular present indicative in Old Norse weak verbs analogically adopted the ending `-(i)r`, which originally came from the 2nd person singular.\n4.  **Final Old Norse Form:** Combining the umlauted stem `sǿk-` with the analogical ending `-ir` gives us Old Norse `sǿkir`.\n\n### **Step 3: Proto-Germanic to Old English**\n\n1.  **Starting Form:** PGmc `*sōkiþ`.\n2.  **i-Umlaut (i-Mutation):** The `*i` or `*j` in the stem also causes i-umlaut in Old English (OE). The i-umlaut of PGmc `*ō` in OE is `ē` (a long, front, unrounded vowel). The stem `sōk-` becomes `sēk-`.\n3.  **Palatalization:** In Old English, the velar consonant `*k` was palatalized to `*ċ` (pronounced like `ch` in 'church') when it occurred before a front vowel like the `ē` that resulted from i-umlaut. Thus, the stem `sēk-` becomes `sēċ-`.\n4.  **Ending:** The PGmc ending `*-iþ` becomes `-(e)þ` in Old English. The linking vowel `e` is often present after a consonant.\n5.  **Final Old English Form:** Combining the palatalized stem `sēċ-` with the ending `-eþ` gives Old English `sēceþ`. (A syncopated form, `sēcþ`, is also common).\n\n### **Step 4: Proto-Germanic to Old High German**\n\n1.  **Starting Form:** PGmc `*sōkiþ`.\n2.  **OHG Diphthongization:** Before any other changes, PGmc long vowels were diphthongized in Old High German (OHG). PGmc `*ō` becomes the diphthong `uo`. So the stem `sōk-` becomes `suok-`.\n3.  **High German Consonant Shift:** This is the Second Germanic Sound Shift. The relevant change is that PGmc `*k` shifts to the voiceless velar fricative `hh` (pronounced like `ch` in Scottish 'loch') when it follows a vowel. The stem `suok-` thus becomes `suohh-`.\n4.  **i-Umlaut:** In this class of verbs (weak Class 1 with a heavy stem), the `j` disappeared early in OHG and did not cause i-umlaut on the root vowel `uo`. Therefore, the vowel remains `uo`.\n5.  **Ending:** The PGmc ending `*-iþ` develops into `-(i)t` in Old High German.\n6.  **Final Old High German Form:** Combining the shifted stem `suohh-` with the ending `-it` gives Old High German `suohhit`.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of Results:**\n\n*   **Proto-Germanic:** `*sōkiþ`\n*   **Old Norse:** `sǿkir`\n*   **Old English:** `sēceþ`\n*   **Old High German:** `suohhit`\n\n<<<**Proto-Germanic:** *sōkiþ; **Old Norse:** sǿkir; **Old English:** sēceþ; **Old High German:** suohhit>>>"
