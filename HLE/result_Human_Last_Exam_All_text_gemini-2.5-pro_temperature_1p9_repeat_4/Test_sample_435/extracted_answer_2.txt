CAR T cells manufactured with interleukin-15 would be predicted to exhibit a more robust and sustained release of effector cytokines (such as IFN-γ and TNF-α) upon antigen stimulation compared to CAR T cells manufactured without it. This is because IL-15 promotes a T cell phenotype characterized by greater persistence, higher proliferative capacity, and resistance to exhaustion.
