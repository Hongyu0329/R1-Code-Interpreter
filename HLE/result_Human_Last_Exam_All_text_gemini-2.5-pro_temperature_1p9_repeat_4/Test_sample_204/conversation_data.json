    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Hopf charge of the given vector field.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Vector Field\n\nThe vector field is given by `n = (nx, ny, nz)`:\n*   `f = atan2(y, x)`\n*   `r2 = sqrt((x*x + y*y - 0.5)*(x*x + y*y - 0.5) + z*z)`\n*   `G = PI * exp(-10 * r2)`\n*   `nx = sin(G) * cos(f)`\n*   `ny = sin(G) * sin(f)`\n*   `nz = cos(G)`\n\nWe can observe that `nx^2 + ny^2 + nz^2 = sin^2(G)cos^2(f) + sin^2(G)sin^2(f) + cos^2(G) = sin^2(G) + cos^2(G) = 1`. This means that the vector field `n(x, y, z)` is a map from the 3D space `R^3` to the surface of a unit sphere, `S^2`. Such maps are classified by an integer topological invariant called the Hopf charge or Hopf index.\n\n### 2. Understanding the Hopf Charge\n\nThe Hopf charge `H` of a map `n: R^3 -> S^2` is a topological invariant that describes how the preimages of any two distinct points on the sphere `S^2` are linked in the domain `R^3`. For the purpose of defining this invariant, the domain `R^3` is compactified to a 3-sphere `S^3` by adding a \"point at infinity\".\n\nThe Hopf charge `H` can be calculated as the linking number of the preimages of two regular points, `p` and `q`, on the target sphere `S^2`:\n`H = Lk(n^{-1}(p), n^{-1}(q))`\n\n### 3. Analyzing the Field Structure\n\nLet's identify the key features of our map `n(x, y, z)`:\n\n*   The variables `G` and `f` correspond to the spherical coordinates (polar angle `θ` and azimuthal angle `φ`) of the vector `n` on the sphere `S^2`. So, `θ_n = G` and `φ_n = f`.\n*   `f = atan2(y, x)` is the standard cylindrical azimuthal angle `φ` in the `(x, y, z)` space.\n*   The variable `r2` represents the distance from a point `(x, y, z)` to the circle defined by `x^2 + y^2 = 0.5` and `z = 0`. This circle is the \"core\" of the field structure.\n*   **At the core:** For points on the circle `x^2+y^2=0.5, z=0`, we have `r2 = 0`.\n    `G = PI * exp(0) = PI`.\n    `n = (sin(PI)cos(f), sin(PI)sin(f), cos(PI)) = (0, 0, -1)`.\n    The entire core circle maps to the South Pole of the sphere `S^2`.\n*   **At infinity:** As `(x,y,z)` goes to infinity, `r2` approaches infinity.\n    `G = PI * exp(-infinity) = 0`.\n    `n = (sin(0)cos(f), sin(0)sin(f), cos(0)) = (0, 0, 1)`.\n    All points at infinity map to the North Pole of `S^2`. This is consistent with the compactification of `R^3` to `S^3`.\n\n### 4. Calculating the Hopf Charge using Linking Number\n\nWe will calculate the linking number of the preimages of two judiciously chosen points on `S^2`.\n\n**Step 4.1: Choose two points on S^2.**\n\nLet's choose `q` to be the South Pole `(0, 0, -1)` and `p` to be a point on the equator, for instance, `(1, 0, 0)`.\n\n**Step 4.2: Find the preimage of `q = (0, 0, -1)`.**\n\nThe condition `n = q` means `nz = -1`, which implies `cos(G) = -1`, so `G = PI`.\nFrom the definition of `G`, we have:\n`PI = PI * exp(-10 * r2)`\n`1 = exp(-10 * r2)`\n`-10 * r2 = 0`, which means `r2 = 0`.\nFrom the definition of `r2`:\n`sqrt((x^2 + y^2 - 0.5)^2 + z^2) = 0`\nThis is only true if `z = 0` and `(x^2 + y^2 - 0.5)^2 = 0`, which simplifies to `x^2 + y^2 = 0.5`.\nSo, the preimage `C_q = n^{-1}(q)` is the circle in the `xy`-plane centered at the origin with radius `sqrt(0.5)`.\n\n**Step 4.3: Find the preimage of `p = (1, 0, 0)`.**\n\nThe condition `n = p` means `nx=1`, `ny=0`, `nz=0`.\n1.  `nz = cos(G) = 0`  => `G = PI / 2`.\n2.  `ny = sin(G) * sin(f) = sin(PI/2) * sin(f) = sin(f) = 0`.\n3.  `nx = sin(G) * cos(f) = sin(PI/2) * cos(f) = cos(f) = 1`.\nFrom conditions 2 and 3, we get `f = 0`.\n\nNow we use the condition on `G`:\n`G = PI / 2` => `PI / 2 = PI * exp(-10 * r2)`\n`1/2 = exp(-10 * r2)`\n`ln(1/2) = -10 * r2` => `-ln(2) = -10 * r2`\n`r2 = ln(2) / 10`.\n\nThe condition `f = atan2(y, x) = 0` implies that `y=0` and `x>0`.\nThe condition on `r2` then becomes:\n`sqrt((x^2 + 0^2 - 0.5)^2 + z^2) = ln(2) / 10`\nLet `R = ln(2) / 10`. The equation for the preimage `C_p = n^{-1}(p)` is:\n`C_p: (x^2 - 0.5)^2 + z^2 = R^2`, subject to the conditions `y = 0` and `x > 0`.\nThis curve is a circle in the `x>0` half of the `xz`-plane.\n\n**Step 4.4: Calculate the linking number `Lk(C_p, C_q)`.**\n\nThe linking number can be found by counting the signed intersections of one curve (`C_p`) with a surface (`S_q`) bounded by the other curve (`C_q`).\n*   `C_q` is the circle `x^2 + y^2 = 0.5, z = 0`.\n*   Let `S_q` be the disk bounded by `C_q`: `S_q = {(x,y,z) | x^2 + y^2 <= 0.5, z = 0}`.\n*   `C_p` is a circle in the `xz`-plane (`y=0`). We need to find where `C_p` intersects the `z=0` plane, which contains the disk `S_q`.\n\nTo find the intersection points, we set `z=0` in the equation for `C_p`:\n`(x^2 - 0.5)^2 = R^2`\n`x^2 - 0.5 = ± R`\n`x^2 = 0.5 ± R`\n\nSince `R = ln(2)/10 ≈ 0.0693`, both `0.5 + R` and `0.5 - R` are positive. Since the preimage `C_p` requires `x > 0`, we have two intersection points with the `z=0` plane:\n*   `P_1`: `x_1 = sqrt(0.5 + R)`, `y=0`, `z=0`.\n*   `P_2`: `x_2 = sqrt(0.5 - R)`, `y=0`, `z=0`.\n\nNow, we check if these points lie inside the disk `S_q` (i.e., if `x^2+y^2 <= 0.5`).\n*   For `P_1`: `x_1^2 + y^2 = (0.5 + R) + 0 = 0.5 + R > 0.5`. This point is **outside** the disk `S_q`.\n*   For `P_2`: `x_2^2 + y^2 = (0.5 - R) + 0 = 0.5 - R < 0.5`. This point is **inside** the disk `S_q`.\n\nThe curve `C_p` pierces the surface `S_q` exactly once. The magnitude of the linking number is the number of such intersections.\nTherefore, `|Lk(C_p, C_q)| = 1`.\n\n### 5. Conclusion\n\nThe Hopf charge is the linking number, which we found to have a magnitude of 1. The sign of the charge depends on conventions for orientation, but the absolute value is 1.\n\nThe Hopf charge of this field is 1."
