    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Core Subject:** A philosopher.\n    *   **Affiliation:** Belongs to the Lviv-Warsaw School of philosophy.\n    *   **Specific Contribution:** Decomposed the notion of \"hallmark\" into two sub-categories: \"symptoms\" and \"signals.\"\n\n2.  **Identify the Key Concepts:**\n    *   **Lviv-Warsaw School:** A highly influential Polish school of logic and analytic philosophy active in the interwar period. Its members are known for their clarity, rigor, and focus on logic, semantics, and epistemology. Key figures include Kazimierz Twardowski (the founder), Jan Łukasiewicz, Alfred Tarski, Stanisław Leśniewski, Tadeusz Kotarbiński, and Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz.\n    *   **Hallmark (or Mark/Indicator):** This refers to a general concept of a sign; something that points to, indicates, or is a characteristic of something else. In Polish, the relevant term would be *znamię* or *oznaka*.\n    *   **Symptom:** This is a type of sign that has a natural, causal, or empirical connection to what it signifies. The presence of the symptom is a reliable indicator of the presence of the thing it is a symptom of due to the laws of nature. For example, fever is a symptom of illness.\n    *   **Signal (or Sign proper):** This is a type of sign where the connection to what it signifies is conventional, intentional, or based on rules established by humans. Its meaning is assigned, not natural. For example, a red traffic light is a signal to stop.\n\n3.  **Scan the Philosophers of the Lviv-Warsaw School:**\n    *   The question relates to the philosophy of language, logic, and semiotics (the theory of signs).\n    *   Several members of the school worked in these areas, but the specific distinction between natural signs (symptoms) and conventional signs (signals) is a well-known contribution of **Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz**.\n\n4.  **Confirm the Contribution:**\n    *   Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz, in works like his influential textbook *Pragmatic Logic* (*Logika pragmatyczna*), provides a detailed analysis of signs and meaning.\n    *   He explicitly analyzes the general notion of an indicator or mark (*oznaka*).\n    *   He decomposes this general notion into **symptoms (objawy)**, which are natural indicators, and **signs/signals (znaki/sygnały)**, which are conventional and intentionally used to communicate.\n    *   This distinction was fundamental to his pragmatic approach to language and his efforts to build a clear and unambiguous scientific language. He saw the understanding of these different sign functions as crucial for clear reasoning and avoiding logical fallacies.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis, the philosopher from the Lviv-Warsaw School who decomposed the notion of a hallmark (or mark/indicator) into symptoms and signals is Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz. This distinction is a cornerstone of his semiotic theory and pragmatic logic.\n\n<<<Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz>>>"
