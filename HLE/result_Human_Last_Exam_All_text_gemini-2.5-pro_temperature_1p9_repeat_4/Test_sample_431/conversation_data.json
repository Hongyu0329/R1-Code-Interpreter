    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of Cysteine residues in the TM3-TM4 linker of the human GABAAρ1 receptor.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Protein and its Canonical Sequence\nThe protein in question is the human Gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor subunit rho-1, also known as GABAAρ1. To ensure accuracy, we will use the canonical sequence from a reliable protein database.\n\n*   **Protein Name:** Gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor subunit rho-1 (GABAAρ1)\n*   **Organism:** *Homo sapiens* (Human)\n*   **Gene Name:** *GABRR1*\n*   **UniProt Accession Number:** The reviewed, canonical sequence for this protein is found under the UniProt accession number **P24046**.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Boundaries of the Transmembrane Domains\nThe question asks for the linker region between transmembrane domain 3 (TM3) and transmembrane domain 4 (TM4). We need to find the precise amino acid positions of these domains from the UniProt annotation for P24046.\n\n*   **Transmembrane Domain 3 (TM3):** Spans from amino acid residue **313 to 335**.\n*   **Transmembrane Domain 4 (TM4):** Spans from amino acid residue **432 to 452**.\n\n### Step 3: Define the TM3-TM4 Linker Domain\nThe TM3-TM4 linker is the intracellular loop that connects the end of TM3 to the start of TM4. Based on the coordinates from Step 2:\n\n*   The linker begins at the residue immediately following the end of TM3 (residue 335). Therefore, the linker starts at residue **336**.\n*   The linker ends at the residue immediately preceding the start of TM4 (residue 432). Therefore, the linker ends at residue **431**.\n*   Thus, the TM3-TM4 linker domain comprises residues **336 to 431**.\n\n### Step 4: Extract the Amino Acid Sequence of the TM3-TM4 Linker\nUsing the canonical sequence for UniProt entry P24046, we will isolate the specific portion corresponding to residues 336-431.\n\nThe sequence for the TM3-TM4 linker (residues 336-431) is:\n`CTMIMSWVFWVDYRASAKPVPPSSGDGSSQRSGSSQEPQRRHGRHRQQQPARPGPSAPLSLAQRPAPSRKASPPAAEVAAAAEAALRAAAEAPSVTR`\n\n### Step 5: Count the Cysteine Residues in the Linker Sequence\nThe final step is to count the number of Cysteine residues (single-letter code 'C') within the extracted sequence.\n\nLet's scan the sequence:\n**C**TMIMSWVFWVDYRASAKPVPPSSGDGSSQRSGSSQEPQRRHGRHRQQQPARPGPSAPLSLAQRPAPSRKASPPAAEVAAAAEAALRAAAEAPSVTR\n\n*   There is one Cysteine ('C') at the very beginning of the linker sequence (position 336).\n*   There are no other Cysteine residues in the remainder of the linker sequence.\n\nTherefore, there is only one Cysteine residue in the TM3-TM4 linker domain of the human GABAAρ1 receptor.\n\n<<<1>>>"
