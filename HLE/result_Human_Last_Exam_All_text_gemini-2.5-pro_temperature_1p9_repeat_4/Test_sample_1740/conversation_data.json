    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of let-7 family members identified in humans.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Question**\nThe core of the question is to find the total number of members belonging to the \"let-7 family\" of microRNAs that have been identified in \"humans\" up \"to date\". This requires consulting a current and authoritative biological database.\n\n**Step 2: Define the \"let-7 Family\"**\nThe let-7 family is a group of microRNAs (miRNAs), which are short non-coding RNA molecules involved in gene regulation. Family members are grouped together because they share a highly conserved \"seed sequence\"â€”a short nucleotide sequence that is critical for binding to target messenger RNAs (mRNAs). For the let-7 family, this seed sequence is typically GAGGUAG.\n\n**Step 3: Identify a Definitive Source**\nThe most reliable and universally recognized database for microRNA sequences and annotation is **miRBase**. It is the central repository for all published miRNA data. Any count of miRNA family members should be based on the latest release of this database.\n\n**Step 4: Differentiate Between Genes and Mature miRNAs (A Careful Point)**\nIt is crucial to distinguish between miRNA genes (precursors) and the final, functional mature miRNAs.\n*   **Precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA):** The initial transcript from a gene, which has a hairpin-loop structure. A single species of mature miRNA can be encoded by multiple different genes at different locations in the genome. For example, `let-7a-1`, `let-7a-2`, and `let-7a-3` are three different genes that all produce the identical mature `let-7a` miRNA.\n*   **Mature miRNA:** The final, processed ~22 nucleotide single-stranded RNA that gets incorporated into the RISC complex to regulate gene expression.\n\nThe question \"how many members\" most commonly refers to the number of distinct mature miRNAs in the family, as these are the functional molecules with unique or near-unique sequences.\n\n**Step 5: List the Human let-7 Family Members**\nConsulting miRBase and established scientific literature, we can list the distinct mature miRNAs that constitute the human let-7 family. They are grouped by their shared seed sequence.\n\nThe established members are:\n1.  **let-7a** (produced from genes *let-7a-1*, *let-7a-2*, *let-7a-3*)\n2.  **let-7b**\n3.  **let-7c**\n4.  **let-7d**\n5.  **let-7e**\n6.  **let-7f** (produced from genes *let-7f-1*, *let-7f-2*)\n7.  **let-7g**\n8.  **let-7i**\n9.  **miR-98** (This miRNA is considered a member of the let-7 family due to high sequence homology, particularly in the seed region, and its genomic clustering with other let-7 members).\n\n**Step 6: Tally the Final Count**\nBy counting the list of distinct mature miRNAs from Step 5, we arrive at the total number.\n\n*   let-7a\n*   let-7b\n*   let-7c\n*   let-7d\n*   let-7e\n*   let-7f\n*   let-7g\n*   let-7i\n*   miR-98\n\nThe total count is **9**.\n\n**Summary of Careful Points:**\n*   **Source of information:** Use an authoritative and up-to-date source like the miRBase database.\n*   **Definition of \"member\":** Clarify whether the question refers to genes (loci) or distinct mature miRNA products. The standard interpretation is the number of unique mature miRNAs.\n*   **Inclusion of miR-98:** Recognize that miR-98 is universally considered a member of the let-7 family despite its different name.\n*   **Counting duplicates:** Be careful not to double-count. For example, `let-7a-1`, `let-7a-2`, and `let-7a-3` only count as one member (`let-7a`) when referring to mature miRNAs. If the question were about gene loci, the count would be 12.\n\nBased on this analysis, the human let-7 family consists of 9 distinct mature microRNA members.\n\n<<<9>>>"
