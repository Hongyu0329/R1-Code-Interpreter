    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the values of λ for which the given integral equation has no solutions.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the integral equation and its kernel.**\nThe given equation is a Fredholm integral equation of the second kind:\n$u(x) = 1 + λ ∫₀¹ K(x, y) u(y) dy$\nwhere the kernel is $K(x, y) = \\frac{xⁿ - yⁿ}{x - y}$ and the forcing function is $f(x)=1$.\n\n**Step 2: Simplify the kernel.**\nThe kernel can be simplified using the formula for the sum of a geometric series:\n$xⁿ - yⁿ = (x - y)(xⁿ⁻¹ + xⁿ⁻²y + \\dots + xyⁿ⁻² + yⁿ⁻¹)$.\nSo, the kernel is a polynomial in x and y:\n$K(x, y) = xⁿ⁻¹ + xⁿ⁻²y + \\dots + yⁿ⁻¹ = \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1-k} y^k$.\nThis is a separable (or degenerate) kernel, which means it can be written as a finite sum of products of functions of x and functions of y. The kernel is also real and symmetric, since $K(x,y) = K(y,x)$.\n\n**Step 3: Reduce the integral equation to a system of linear algebraic equations.**\nSubstitute the series form of the kernel into the integral equation:\n$u(x) = 1 + λ \\int_0^1 \\left( \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1-k} y^k \\right) u(y) dy$\nWe can interchange the summation and integration:\n$u(x) = 1 + λ \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1-k} \\int_0^1 y^k u(y) dy$.\nLet's define a set of constants $c_k$ as the moments of the unknown function $u(y)$:\n$c_k = \\int_0^1 y^k u(y) dy$, for $k = 0, 1, \\dots, n-1$.\nSubstituting these constants, the solution $u(x)$ must have the form of a polynomial of degree at most $n-1$:\n$u(x) = 1 + λ \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} c_k x^{n-1-k}$.\nTo find the unknown constants $c_j$, we substitute this form of $u(x)$ back into their definitions:\n$c_j = \\int_0^1 y^j \\left( 1 + λ \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} c_k y^{n-1-k} \\right) dy$\n$c_j = \\int_0^1 y^j dy + λ \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} c_k \\int_0^1 y^j y^{n-1-k} dy$\n$c_j = \\frac{1}{j+1} + λ \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} c_k \\int_0^1 y^{j+n-1-k} dy$\n$c_j = \\frac{1}{j+1} + λ \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \\frac{c_k}{j+n-k}$.\nThis gives a system of $n$ linear equations for the $n$ constants $c_0, c_1, \\dots, c_{n-1}$. We can write this system in matrix form as:\n$\\mathbf{c} = \\mathbf{b} + λ A \\mathbf{c}$, which can be rearranged to $(I - λA)\\mathbf{c} = \\mathbf{b}$.\nHere:\n*   $\\mathbf{c} = [c_0, c_1, \\dots, c_{n-1}]^T$ is the vector of unknown constants.\n*   $\\mathbf{b}$ is a vector with elements $b_j = \\frac{1}{j+1}$, so $\\mathbf{b} = [1, 1/2, \\dots, 1/n]^T$.\n*   $A$ is an $n \\times n$ matrix with elements $A_{jk} = \\frac{1}{j+n-k}$ (where $j$ is the row index and $k$ is the column index, both from $0$ to $n-1$).\n\n**Step 4: Apply the Fredholm Alternative Theorem.**\nThe linear system $(I - λA)\\mathbf{c} = \\mathbf{b}$ has a unique solution if the matrix $(I - λA)$ is invertible, i.e., $\\det(I - λA) \\neq 0$.\nIf $\\det(I - λA) = 0$, the system either has no solution or infinitely many solutions. This condition is equivalent to $1/λ$ being an eigenvalue of the matrix A. The values of $λ$ for which this occurs are called the characteristic values of the integral operator.\n\nThe Fredholm Alternative Theorem for integral equations states:\n1.  If the homogeneous equation $v(x) = λ \\int K(x,y) v(y) dy$ has only the trivial solution $v(x)=0$ (i.e., λ is not a characteristic value), then the inhomogeneous equation has a unique solution for any $f(x)$.\n2.  If the homogeneous equation has non-trivial solutions $v(x)$ (i.e., λ is a characteristic value), the inhomogeneous equation has a solution if and only if the forcing function $f(x)$ is orthogonal to all solutions $w(x)$ of the adjoint homogeneous equation $w(x) = \\bar{λ} \\int K(y,x) w(y) dy$.\n\nIn our problem, $f(x)=1$, and the kernel $K(x,y)$ is real and symmetric, so the adjoint operator is the same as the original operator. Thus, the adjoint eigenfunctions are the same as the original eigenfunctions $v(x)$.\nThe condition for a solution to exist for a characteristic value λ is:\n$\\int_0^1 f(x) v(x) dx = \\int_0^1 1 \\cdot v(x) dx = 0$.\n\nTherefore, the original integral equation has **no solution** if:\na) $λ$ is a characteristic value (i.e., $1/λ$ is an eigenvalue of the matrix A).\nb) The corresponding eigenfunction $v(x)$ does not satisfy the orthogonality condition $\\int_0^1 v(x) dx = 0$.\n\n**Step 5: Analyze the orthogonality condition.**\nAn eigenfunction $v(x)$ of the homogeneous equation is a polynomial of degree at most $n-1$: $v(x) = \\lambda \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} d_k x^{n-1-k}$, where $d_k = \\int_0^1 y^k v(y) dy$.\nThe orthogonality condition is $\\int_0^1 v(x) dx = 0$.\nBy definition, $d_0 = \\int_0^1 y^0 v(y) dy = \\int_0^1 v(y) dy$.\nSo the condition $\\int_0^1 v(x) dx = 0$ is equivalent to the first coefficient $d_0$ of the moment vector $\\mathbf{d}$ being zero.\nThe vector $\\mathbf{d} = [d_0, \\dots, d_{n-1}]^T$ is an eigenvector of the matrix A with eigenvalue $\\nu=1/\\lambda$.\nThe question reduces to finding the values of $λ=1/\\nu$ for which the corresponding eigenvector $\\mathbf{d}$ has $d_0 \\ne 0$.\n\n**Step 6: Determine if $d_0$ can be zero for an eigenvector.**\nThe eigenvector equation is $A \\mathbf{d} = \\nu \\mathbf{d}$. The first row of this matrix equation is:\n$\\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} A_{0k} d_k = \\nu d_0 \\implies \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \\frac{d_k}{n-k} = \\nu d_0$.\nIf $d_0=0$ for some eigenvector, it would mean $\\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} d_k/(n-k) = 0$. This represents a non-trivial constraint on the other components of the eigenvector. While not strictly impossible, it is not generally expected.\nMore fundamentally, the subspace $\\{ \\mathbf{z} \\in \\mathbb{R}^n | z_0 = 0 \\}$ is not an invariant subspace of A, because for a general vector $\\mathbf{d}$ in this subspace, the first component of $A\\mathbf{d}$, which is $\\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} d_k/(n-k)$, is not guaranteed to be zero.\nTherefore, it is highly unlikely that any eigenvector of A will have $d_0=0$. We assume that for all eigenvalues $\\nu$ of A, the corresponding eigenvectors $\\mathbf{d}$ have $d_0 \\neq 0$.\nUnder this assumption, for every characteristic value $λ$, the orthogonality condition $\\int_0^1 v(x) dx = 0$ is violated.\n\n**Step 7: Final Conclusion.**\nThe equation has no solutions for all characteristic values $λ$. These are the values $λ = 1/\\nu$, where $\\nu$ is an eigenvalue of the $n \\times n$ matrix A with elements $A_{jk} = \\frac{1}{j+n-k}$ for $j, k = 0, \\dots, n-1$. The number of such values, counting multiplicities, is $n$. These values depend on $n$.\n*   For $n=1$, $A=[1]$, so $\\nu=1$ and $\\lambda=1$.\n*   For $n=2$, $A=\\begin{pmatrix} 1/2 & 1 \\\\ 1/3 & 1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$. The eigenvalues are $\\nu = \\frac{1}{2} \\pm \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}$, which gives $\\lambda = \\frac{1}{1/2 \\pm 1/\\sqrt{3}} = -6 \\pm 4\\sqrt{3}$.\n\nThe question asks for the values of λ. Without a specific value for $n$, we can only characterize them in this way.\n\nThe set of values of λ for which the equation has no solution is the set of reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the matrix A, where $A_{jk} = \\frac{1}{j+n-k}$."
