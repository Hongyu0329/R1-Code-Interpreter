    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the main components of the question.**\nThe question asks for the name of a specific character in a specific novel.\n*   **Novel:** \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość\" (Perfect Imperfection)\n*   **Author:** Jacek Dukaj\n*   **Protagonist (Main Character):** We need to identify who this is.\n*   **Action:** Marriage.\n*   **Target:** The name of the character the protagonist marries.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the main character of \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość\".**\nThe main character of the novel is Adam Zamoyski, a man from the 21st century who has been cryogenically frozen and is resurrected in the very distant future.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the main character's relationships in the novel.**\nAdam Zamoyski, upon his reawakening, is guided and accompanied by a post-human being, a member of the civilization known as \"stahs\" (standard, ultimate humans). This guide is a central figure in his life and the plot.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the character Adam Zamoyski marries.**\nAdam Zamoyski's guide and protector is a stah named Angelina. Their relationship evolves from a professional one (guide and subject) to a deeply personal and romantic one. This relationship culminates in a marriage ceremony, which is a significant event in the novel, symbolizing the union of old humanity with the post-human future.\n\n**Step 5: Consolidate the information to form the final answer.**\nThe main character is Adam Zamoyski. He marries the stah who guides him through the future world. Her name is Angelina.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   **Correctly identifying the protagonist:** The protagonist is clearly Adam Zamoyski, the \"resurrected\" human.\n*   **Understanding \"marriage\" in context:** The concept of marriage in this far-future sci-fi setting is unique and technologically advanced, but it is explicitly referred to and treated as a marriage within the narrative.\n*   **Character name accuracy:** The name of the character is Angelina. It's important not to confuse her with other entities or characters in the complex world Dukaj creates.\n\nThe name of the character that the main character of Jacek Dukaj's novel \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość\" marries is Angelina.\n\n<<<Angelina>>>"
