    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the length of the Second Great War in StarCraft lore.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Define the \"Second Great War\"**: The term \"Second Great War\" refers to the galactic conflict depicted throughout the *StarCraft II* saga. This includes the events of the three main campaigns—*Wings of Liberty*, *Heart of the Swarm*, *Legacy of the Void*—and the final epilogue, *Into the Void*.\n\n2.  **Establish the Start Date**: The war officially begins with the Zerg's renewed invasion of the Terran Dominion, specifically the attack on Mar Sara. This event kicks off the *Wings of Liberty* campaign and is dated in the official StarCraft timeline to the year **2504**.\n\n3.  **Establish the End Date**: The war concludes with the final defeat of the dark god Amon by the united Protoss, Terran, and Zerg forces. This occurs during the epilogue campaign, *Into the Void*. According to the lore, the epilogue takes place two years after the main events of *Legacy of the Void* (which occurred in 2506). Therefore, the war's conclusion is dated to the year **2508**.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Duration and Handle the Rounding**: The question asks for the duration in years, \"rounded up\". There are two primary ways to interpret this.\n\n    *   **Method 1: Simple Subtraction.** One could subtract the start year from the end year: 2508 - 2504 = 4 years. This gives a rough estimate of the duration. However, this method doesn't account for the specific start/end points within those years and ignores the \"rounded up\" instruction if the result is exactly 4.\n\n    *   **Method 2: Counting Spanned Years (Ceiling Function).** The \"rounded up\" instruction implies that any fraction of a year should be counted as a full year. Therefore, a more accurate method is to count every calendar year that the war was active in. The war's timeline spans across:\n        *   **2504**: The beginning of the war (*Wings of Liberty*).\n        *   **2505**: The continuation of the war (*Heart of the Swarm*).\n        *   **2506**: The climax of the main conflict (*Legacy of the Void*).\n        *   **2507**: The period of rebuilding and searching for Amon between the end of *Legacy of the Void* and the epilogue. The state of war with the ultimate foe still exists.\n        *   **2508**: The final battles and conclusion of the war (*Into the Void*).\n\n    Counting these individual years gives a total of 5 distinct years over which the conflict took place.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Definition of the War:** It is crucial to correctly identify the start and end points of the war. The war begins with the first shots of *Wings of Liberty* and ends only after Amon's final defeat in the *Into the Void* epilogue.\n*   **\"Rounded Up\" Clause:** This is the most important part of the question. It steers the calculation away from a simple subtraction that might result in a fractional number or an integer that doesn't account for the full span. It favors an interpretation that counts any partial year as a whole one, leading to the \"ceiling\" of the duration.\n*   **The Gap Year (2507):** Although there was no major campaign in 2507, the threat of Amon was not yet permanently eliminated. The state of war can be considered ongoing until the final resolution in 2508, thus the year 2507 is included in the war's timespan.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nBy counting each calendar year from the start of the conflict (2504) to its end (2508), we account for the entire duration as requested by the \"rounded up\" requirement. The years are 2504, 2505, 2506, 2507, and 2508, making a total of 5 years.\n\n<<<5>>>"
