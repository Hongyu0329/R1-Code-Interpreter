    "An elementary cellular automaton consists of a one-dimensional grid of cells, each of which can be in a state of 0 or 1. The state of each cell in the next generation is determined by a rule that depends on the current state of the cell and its immediate left and right neighbors.\n\n### Step 1: Understand Rule 110\n\nRule 110 is one of the 256 possible elementary cellular automaton rules. The rule is defined by the outcome for each of the 8 possible 3-cell neighborhood patterns. The rule number, 110, in binary is `01101110`. We map this 8-bit number to the 8 possible neighborhoods, which are typically ordered from `111` down to `000`.\n\nThe rule is as follows:\n*   `111` -> `0`\n*   `110` -> `1`\n*   `101` -> `1`\n*   `100` -> `0`\n*   `011` -> `1`\n*   `010` -> `1`\n*   `001` -> `1`\n*   `000` -> `0`\n\n### Step 2: Define Initial State and Process\n\nThe initial state is a single cell in state 1, on an otherwise infinite grid of 0s. We can represent this as `...00100...`. The \"binary pattern\" we are looking for at each step is the sequence of 0s and 1s starting from the leftmost '1' and ending with the rightmost '1'.\n\nTo get the next generation, we calculate the new state for each cell based on its 3-cell neighborhood from the current generation. The grid is assumed to be padded with infinite 0s on both ends.\n\n### Step 3: Step-by-Step Simulation\n\nLet's simulate the rule for 20 iterations. We denote the pattern at time `t` as `S_t`.\n\n*   **t=0:** `S_0 = 1`\n*   **t=1:** We compute the next state from the padded pattern `...00100...`.\n    *   The neighborhood to the left of the '1' is `001` -> `1`.\n    *   The neighborhood of the '1' itself is `010` -> `1`.\n    *   The neighborhood to the right of the '1' is `100` -> `0`.\n    *   This gives `...0110...`. The pattern from the first '1' to the last '1' is `11`.\n    *   `S_1 = 11`\n*   **t=2:** Current pattern is `11`. Padded: `...001100...`.\n    *   New states are determined by neighborhoods `001`, `011`, `110`, `100`.\n    *   Applying the rules: `1`, `1`, `1`, `0`.\n    *   Result: `...01110...` -> `S_2 = 111`\n*   **t=3:** Current pattern `111`. Padded: `...0011100...`.\n    *   `S_3 = 1101`\n*   **t=4:** Current pattern `1101`. Padded: `...00110100...`.\n    *   `S_4 = 11111`\n*   **t=5:** `S_5 = 110001`\n*   **t=6:** `S_6 = 1110011`\n*   **t=7:** `S_7 = 11010111`\n*   **t=8:** `S_8 = 111111001`\n*   **t=9:** `S_9 = 1100001011`\n*   **t=10:** `S_{10} = 11100011111`\n*   **t=11:** `S_{11} = 1101001100001`\n*   **t=12:** `S_{12} = 11111011100011`\n*   **t=13:** `S_{13} = 110001110100111`\n*   **t=14:** `S_{14} = 11100110111011001`\n*   **t=15:** `S_{15} = 110101111101111011`\n*   **t=16:** `S_{16} = 1111110000111001111`\n*   **t=17:** `S_{17} = 110000100011010110001`\n*   **t=18:** `S_{18} = 111000110011111110011`\n*   **t=19:** `S_{19} = 1101001110110000010111`\n\n### Step 4: Final Calculation for t=20\n\nThe pattern at t=19 is `1101001110110000010111`. To calculate the pattern at t=20, we apply the rule to each 3-cell neighborhood of the padded version of this pattern (`...00110100111011000001011100...`).\n\nThis yields the following 24-bit pattern:\n`S_{20} = 111110110111100001111001`\n\n### Summary of Careful Points\n*   **Rule Mapping:** Correctly map the binary `01101110` to the neighborhoods `111` through `000`.\n*   **Boundary Conditions:** Assume the pattern is on an infinite grid of zeros.\n*   **Pattern Definition:** The pattern includes all cells from the leftmost '1' to the rightmost '1'. Zeros within this range are significant.\n*   **Iterative Process:** Ensure each new generation is calculated based entirely on the complete state of the previous generation.\n\n<<<111110110111100001111001>>>"
