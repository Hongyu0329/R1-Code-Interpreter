The appropriate management involves a multi-stage approach prioritized by the patient's systemic health.

**1. Procedures and Cells of Interest:**

*   **Immediate Management:**
    1.  **Medical Stabilization (Priority #1):** An urgent referral to a physician is required to begin treatment for her uncontrolled diabetes mellitus (HbA1c 7.5%). No definitive dental work should start until her glycemic levels are stable and controlled.
    2.  **Acute Dental Care:** Manage the trauma with pain medication, a course of systemic antibiotics to prevent infection (a high risk due to diabetes), tetanus prophylaxis, and gentle debridement of the tooth sockets. Radiographs are needed to assess for bone fractures.

*   **Definitive Management (Post-Stabilization):**
    1.  The most appropriate long-term solution for replacing the missing teeth (left lateral incisor, canine, first premolar) is a **Removable Partial Denture (RPD)**. A fixed bridge is not ideal due to the long span and stressful Class III bite, and implants are contraindicated until her diabetes is proven to be well-managed over the long term.

*   **Cells of Interest:**
    *   **Periodontal Ligament (PDL) Cells:** Their non-viability after 28 hours makes reimplantation of the lost teeth impossible.
    *   **Neutrophils and Macrophages (Immune Cells):** Their function is compromised by hyperglycemia, making the patient highly susceptible to infection in the sockets.
    *   **Fibroblasts and Osteoblasts:** Their impaired function in uncontrolled diabetes leads to delayed and poor wound healing of the sockets.

**2. Denture Choice, Material, and Abutments:**

*   **Type of Denture:** A **Removable Partial Denture (RPD)**.
*   **Material:** The recommended design is a **Cobalt-Chromium cast metal framework** for strength and support, with an **acrylic resin** base and **acrylic teeth**. This is superi
