The final product, C, is **1-bromo-4-phenylbutane**.

This product is **achiral**. The chirality of the starting material, (S)-3-bromo-1-phenylbutane, was eliminated in the first reaction step. The E2 elimination with potassium tert-butoxide created an alkene, 4-phenylbut-1-ene, which destroyed the original stereocenter at C-3. As this intermediate and all subsequent intermediates are achiral, and no new chiral centers are formed during the synthesis, the final product C is also achiral. An analysis of its structure confirms it has no chiral carbons, as no carbon atom is bonded to four different substituent groups.
