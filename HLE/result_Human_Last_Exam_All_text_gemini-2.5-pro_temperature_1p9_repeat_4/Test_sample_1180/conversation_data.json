    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the thickness of the double point of the stable reduction of the curve $C: z^2 = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1$ above the prime 2. The valuation $v$ is the standard 2-adic valuation normalized by $v(2)=1$.\n\n**1. Analyze the initial model and its reduction**\n\nThe curve is defined by the equation $z^2 = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1$. We consider this equation over the ring of 2-adic integers $\\mathbb{Z}_2$.\nReducing the equation modulo 2, we get:\n$z^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$, which can be rewritten as $(z-1)^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$.\nThe special fiber is a double line over the projective line $\\mathbb{P}^1_{\\mathbb{F}_2}$. This model is highly singular and not stable. We need to find a better model through a change of variables, possibly involving a base extension.\n\n**2. Analyze the roots of the polynomial**\n\nThe behavior of the stable reduction is governed by the 2-adic valuations of the roots of the polynomial $f(x) = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1$. We use the Newton polygon method for this.\nThe polynomial is $f(x) = a_5 x^5 + a_4 x^4 + a_3 x^3 + a_2 x^2 + a_1 x + a_0$.\nThe coefficients are $a_5=2, a_3=2, a_0=1$. The other coefficients are 0.\nThe 2-adic valuations of the coefficients are $v(a_5)=1, v(a_3)=1, v(a_0)=0$.\nThe vertices of the Newton polygon are the points $(i, v(a_i))$ in the lower convex hull. We plot the points corresponding to non-zero coefficients: $(5, 1)$, $(3, 1)$, and $(0, 0)$.\nThe lower convex hull is formed by the line segment connecting $(0, 0)$ and $(5, 1)$. The point $(3, 1)$ lies above this segment, as the line passes through $(3, 3/5)$, and $1 > 3/5$.\nThe Newton polygon consists of a single segment from $(0, 0)$ to $(5, 1)$. The slope of this segment is:\n$m = \\frac{1-0}{5-0} = \\frac{1}{5}$.\nAccording to the theory of Newton polygons, the valuations of the roots of $f(x)$ in $\\overline{\\mathbb{Q}_2}$ are the negatives of the slopes. Thus, all five roots, let's call them $\\alpha_1, ..., \\alpha_5$, have the same 2-adic valuation:\n$v(\\alpha_i) = -m = -1/5$.\n\n**3. Change of variables to a better model**\n\nSince the root valuations are fractional, we need to pass to a ramified extension of $\\mathbb{Q}_2$ to simplify the model. The denominator of the slope is 5, which indicates that a ramified extension of degree 5 is required.\nLet $K = \\mathbb{Q}_2(\\pi)$ where $\\pi^5 = 2$. This is a totally ramified extension of degree $e=5$. The element $\\pi$ is a uniformizer for the ring of integers $\\mathcal{O}_K$ of $K$. The valuation $v_K$ on $K$ is normalized such that $v_K(\\pi)=1$. For any $a \\in \\mathbb{Q}_2$, $v_K(a) = e \\cdot v(a) = 5v(a)$. Thus, $v_K(2) = 5$.\n\nThe roots have valuation $v(\\alpha_i) = -1/5$, so $v_K(\\alpha_i) = 5v(\\alpha_i) = -1$.\nThis suggests a change of variables $x = X/\\pi$, where $X$ is a new variable. We expect the roots for $X$ to have valuation 0 in $K$.\nSubstitute $x = X/\\pi$ into the curve equation:\n$z^2 = 2(X/\\pi)^5 + 2(X/\\pi)^3 + 1$\n$z^2 = 2(X^5/2) + 2(X^3/\\pi^3) + 1$\n$z^2 = X^5 + 2\\pi^{-3}X^3 + 1$\nSince $\\pi^5=2$, we have $2\\pi^{-3} = \\pi^5 \\pi^{-3} = \\pi^2$.\nThe transformed equation over $K$ is $z^2 = X^5 + \\pi^2 X^3 + 1$.\nThis model, let's call it $C_K$, has coefficients in the ring of integers $\\mathcal{O}_K$. Its special fiber is obtained by reducing modulo $\\pi$:\n$z^2 \\equiv X^5 + 1 \\pmod \\pi$.\n\n**4. Analyze the stable reduction and thickness**\n\nThe special fiber $\\bar{C_K}: z^2 = X^5+1$ is a hyperelliptic curve of genus 2 over $\\mathbb{F}_2$. It is smooth in the affine part since $X^5+1$ has distinct roots in $\\overline{\\mathbb{F}_2}$. However, at the point at infinity, it has a cusp, which means it is not stable. The resolution of this cusp into nodes leads to the stable model. The \"thickness\" of these nodes is determined by the \"perturbing terms\" in the model, which were eliminated during the reduction.\n\nThe equation of our model over $K$ is $z^2 = X^5 + 1 + \\pi^2 X^3$. The term $\\pi^2 X^3$ is the perturbation. The stable reduction process resolves the singularity created by the term dominant at infinity in the unperturbed reduced equation ($z^2=X^5+1$), and the thickness of the resulting node(s) is related to the valuation of the coefficient of the perturbation term.\n\nThe theory of stable reduction for such curves (often called the \"method of weights\" or logarithmic geometry approach) indicates that the thickness of the double point formed in the stable model corresponds to the valuation of the coefficient of this perturbation term.\nIn the model $z^2 = X^5 + \\pi^2 X^3 + 1$, the coefficient is $\\pi^2$. The valuation of this coefficient in the field $K$ is:\nThickness in $K = v_K(\\pi^2) = 2$.\nThe thickness is an integer with respect to the valuation on the field where the stable model is defined.\n\n**5. Convert thickness to the valuation of $\\mathbb{Q}_2$**\n\nThe question asks for the thickness with respect to the original valuation $v$ on $\\mathbb{Q}_2$, where $v(2)=1$. The relationship between the valuations $v_K$ and $v$ is $v(a) = \\frac{1}{e}v_K(a)$, where $e$ is the ramification index. Here $e=5$.\nSo, the thickness with respect to $v$ is:\nThickness$_v = \\frac{1}{e} \\times \\text{Thickness}_K = \\frac{1}{5} \\times 2 = \\frac{2}{5}$.\n\nThis value represents the \"depth\" of the double point singularity in the stable reduction, measured with the 2-adic valuation.\n\n<<<2/5>>>"
