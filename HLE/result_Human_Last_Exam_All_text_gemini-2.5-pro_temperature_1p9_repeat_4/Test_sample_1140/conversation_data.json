    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the most helpful synthesis technique.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Problem**\n\n*   **Molecule:** A peptide that is 100 amino acids (aa) long.\n*   **Key Challenge 1 (Length):** 100 aa is considered a long peptide. It is at the upper limit or beyond the practical range for efficient, high-purity synthesis by a single continuous chemical method.\n*   **Key Challenge 2 (Composition):** The peptide contains 'X', an unnatural amino acid (UAA), specifically azido phenylalanine (AzF). Standard biological synthesis methods only encode the 20 canonical amino acids.\n*   **Goal:** Identify the \"most helpful\" technique that effectively addresses both the length and the UAA incorporation challenge.\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate Potential Synthesis Techniques**\n\nWe will consider the major methods for peptide synthesis and analyze their suitability for this specific problem.\n\n*   **Technique 1: Direct Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS)**\n    *   **Description:** This is the workhorse of chemical peptide synthesis, where amino acids are sequentially added to a growing peptide chain anchored to a solid resin support.\n    *   **Analysis:**\n        *   **UAA Incorporation:** SPPS can handle this well. AzF is commercially available with the necessary protecting groups (e.g., Fmoc-AzF-OH) to be used directly as a building block.\n        *   **Length Limitation:** This is the major drawback. The yield of each coupling and deprotection step is not 100% (typically 99.0-99.8%). For a 100 aa peptide, this involves ~199 chemical steps. Even with a very high 99.5% efficiency per step, the overall theoretical yield would be (0.995)^199 â‰ˆ 37%. In practice, the yield is lower, and more importantly, the final product is contaminated with a complex mixture of deletion sequences (peptides missing one or more amino acids) that are extremely difficult to separate from the full-length product.\n    *   **Conclusion:** SPPS is not the *most helpful* technique due to the severe challenges posed by the 100 aa length.\n\n*   **Technique 2: Native Chemical Ligation (NCL)**\n    *   **Description:** A powerful chemical method for stitching together two smaller, unprotected peptide fragments. Typically, one fragment has a C-terminal thioester, and the other has an N-terminal cysteine. They react to form a native peptide bond at the ligation site.\n    *   **Analysis:**\n        *   **Length Limitation:** NCL effectively solves the length problem. The 100 aa target peptide can be synthesized by making two smaller, ~50 aa fragments via SPPS and then ligating them. Synthesizing a 50 aa peptide is much more feasible and yields a purer product than a 100 aa peptide.\n        *   **UAA Incorporation:** The AzF can be easily incorporated into one of the smaller fragments during its SPPS synthesis.\n    *   **Conclusion:** NCL is a very strong and viable candidate. It is an excellent chemical strategy for producing long peptides.\n\n*   **Technique 3: Recombinant Protein Expression with Genetic Code Expansion**\n    *   **Description:** This is a biological approach that hijacks the cell's natural protein synthesis machinery (the ribosome) to incorporate UAAs.\n    *   **Analysis:**\n        *   **Length Limitation:** This method excels at producing long proteins. A 100 aa peptide is easily synthesized by the ribosome.\n        *   **UAA Incorporation:** This is the central feature of the technique. It overcomes the limitation of the 20-amino-acid genetic code. The process involves several key elements:\n            *   **Careful Point 1 (Codon Reassignment):** A codon is repurposed to specify the UAA. Most commonly, the amber stop codon (UAG) is used. The gene for the target peptide is mutated to have a UAG codon at the position for 'X' (AzF).\n            *   **Careful Point 2 (Orthogonal Pair):** An \"orthogonal\" aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase/tRNA pair is introduced into the host cell (e.g., *E. coli*). \"Orthogonal\" means this new synthetase only attaches AzF to its partner tRNA, and this new tRNA only recognizes the repurposed UAG codon, without cross-reacting with any of the cell's native machinery.\n            *   **Careful Point 3 (Cell Culture):** The engineered host cells are grown in a medium that is supplemented with AzF.\n            *   **Process:** When the ribosome translates the target mRNA and encounters the UAG codon, the orthogonal tRNA, charged with AzF, delivers the UAA for incorporation into the growing peptide chain.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This technique is specifically designed to solve both problems: producing long polypeptides and site-specifically incorporating unnatural amino acids. It is highly efficient and scalable.\n\n### Final Comparison and Answer\n\n*   **SPPS** is not ideal due to the length.\n*   **NCL** is a very good chemical approach.\n*   **Recombinant Expression with Genetic Code Expansion** is an extremely powerful biological approach. It elegantly solves both core challenges by reprogramming the cell's natural, highly efficient protein synthesis system. For producing a UAA-containing polypeptide of this size, it is widely considered the most helpful and powerful method in modern chemical biology.\n\nThe final answer is the description of this biological technique.\n\n<<<The most helpful technique is **recombinant protein expression using genetic code expansion**. This method involves engineering a host organism (like *E. coli*) with an \"orthogonal aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase/tRNA pair\". A codon, typically the amber stop codon (UAG), is reassigned to code for the unnatural amino acid, azido phenylalanine. When the host cell is grown in media supplemented with azido phenylalanine, its ribosomes incorporate this unnatural amino acid at the specified site during protein synthesis, efficiently producing the full-length 100 aa peptide.>>>"
