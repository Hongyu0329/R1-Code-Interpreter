The most helpful technique is **recombinant protein expression using genetic code expansion**. This method involves engineering a host organism (like *E. coli*) with an "orthogonal aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase/tRNA pair". A codon, typically the amber stop codon (UAG), is reassigned to code for the unnatural amino acid, azido phenylalanine. When the host cell is grown in media supplemented with azido phenylalanine, its ribosomes incorporate this unnatural amino acid at the specified site during protein synthesis, efficiently producing the full-length 100 aa peptide.
