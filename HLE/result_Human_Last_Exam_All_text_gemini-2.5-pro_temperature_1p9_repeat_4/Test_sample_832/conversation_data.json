    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of entrelacés in Natalia Osipova's debut variation as Nikiya.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Performance and Choreography**\nThe question concerns a specific performance: Natalia Osipova's debut as Nikiya in *La Bayadère*. The company is the Bolshoi Ballet, and the year is 2009. The scene is the \"Death of Nikiya\" from Act 2, which includes a solo often called the \"Vase Variation.\" We need to analyze the choreography of this specific solo as performed by Osipova.\n\n**Step 2: Define the Ballet Step: Entrelacé**\nThe step in question is the *entrelacé*, also commonly known as a *jeté entrelacé* or *tour jeté*. This is a type of turning leap. The dancer throws one leg up (as in a *grand battement*), jumps while turning their body in the air towards that leg, and lands on the other foot in an arabesque. The key visual is the \"interlaced\" look of the legs as the dancer completes the mid-air turn. It is distinct from a *grand jeté*, which is a large leap forward without the turn.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Variation Sequence**\nIn the \"Death of Nikiya\" variation, after receiving the basket of flowers, Nikiya performs a solo. A major highlight of this solo in the Bolshoi (Grigorovich) production is a powerful diagonal sequence of jumps traveling from one upstage corner to the opposite downstage corner. This is the sequence that contains the *entrelacés*.\n\n**Step 4: Watch the Performance and Count the Steps**\nObserving the footage of Natalia Osipova's 2009 Bolshoi performance of this variation reveals the following:\n*   Osipova begins the diagonal sequence.\n*   She executes the first jump: it is a clear *entrelacé*, with a sharp turn in the air.\n*   She continues across the stage, performing a series of these powerful, turning leaps without a break.\n*   We must count each individual leap in this specific diagonal sequence.\n\n**Step 5: Tally the Count**\nBy counting each distinct jump in the diagonal series, we find:\n1.  First entrelacé\n2.  Second entrelacé\n3.  Third entrelacé\n4.  Fourth entrelacé\n5.  Fifth entrelacé\n6.  Sixth entrelacé\n7.  Seventh entrelacé\n\nAfter this sequence of seven jumps, the choreography transitions to other steps, including piqué turns, expressive poses, and the final dramatic collapse. No other *entrelacés* are performed in the remainder of the solo.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n*   **Correct Performance:** It is crucial to analyze the specified 2009 debut performance, as choreographic details can change between productions, or even be modified by the dancer.\n*   **Correct Step Identification:** The jumps in the sequence are definitively *entrelacés* due to the full body turn in the air, not to be confused with other types of leaps.\n*   **Completeness:** The analysis must cover the entire variation to ensure no other instances of the step are missed. The seven *entrelacés* occur consecutively in one signature sequence.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nBased on the analysis of the specified performance, Natalia Osipova executes exactly seven entrelacés in the diagonal sequence of her \"Death of Nikiya\" variation.\n\n<<<7>>>"
