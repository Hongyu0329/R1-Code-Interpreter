    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the song.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Musical Terminology\n\n*   **Tonic Chord (I or i):** This is the \"home\" chord of a song's key. It's built on the first note of the scale. For example, in the key of C major, the tonic chord is C major (I). In the key of A minor, the tonic is A minor (i).\n*   **Fifth Chord (V or v):** This chord is built on the fifth note of the scale.\n    *   In a **major key**, the diatonic fifth chord is a **major chord**, called the dominant (V). For example, in C major, the fifth note is G, and the chord is G major.\n    *   In a **natural minor key**, the diatonic fifth chord is a **minor chord** (v). For example, in A minor, the fifth note is E, and the chord is E minor.\n*   **Minor Fifth Chord (v):** The question specifies a \"minor fifth chord\". This can mean two things:\n    1.  The song is in a major key, and the Beatles used a \"borrowed chord\" from the parallel minor key. For example, in C major, they would use a G minor chord (v) instead of the standard G major (V). This is a common technique to add a melancholic or sophisticated color. The progression would be **I -> v**.\n    2.  The song is in a minor key, and they used the natural minor's diatonic v chord. The progression would be **i -> v**.\n*   **\"Starts with a chord jump\":** This means the progression happens right at the beginning of the song, as part of the introduction or the first line of the verse.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Potential Candidates\n\nWe need to think of Beatles songs with distinctive openings and analyze their chord progressions.\n\n*   **\"Help!\"**: The song is in A major. It opens with the vocal line \"Help!\", and the chords are A (I) -> C#m (iii) -> F#m (vi). This is not I -> v.\n*   **\"A Hard Day's Night\"**: The song is in G major. It starts with a famous, dissonant G11sus4 chord that functions as the tonic. It doesn't feature the requested jump.\n*   **\"And I Love Her\"**: The intro is based on an F# minor chord. The first chord change is to a C#7 chord. In the key of F# minor, this is a i -> V7 progression (a major dominant seventh), not i -> v.\n*   **\"Come Together\"**: The song is in D minor. The riff and vocal intro establish a D minor chord (i), and the first main chord change in the verse is to an A7 (V7). Again, this is not i -> v.\n\n### Step 3: Identify the Correct Song and Analyze its Progression\n\nLet's consider the song **\"Michelle\"** from the album *Rubber Soul*.\n\n1.  **Key:** The song is in the key of F major. Therefore, the tonic chord (I) is **F major**.\n2.  **Fifth Chord:** The fifth note of the F major scale (F-G-A-Bb-C-D-E) is C. The standard dominant chord (V) in this key would be C major.\n3.  **The \"Minor Fifth\":** A minor fifth chord (v) in the key of F major would be **C minor**. This is a non-diatonic or \"borrowed\" chord from the parallel key of F minor.\n4.  **Opening Progression:** The song begins with a short instrumental melody. The first vocal line is \"Michelle, ma belle...\".\n    *   The chord under the word \"Michelle\" is **F major (I)**, the tonic.\n    *   The chord immediately changes under the words \"ma belle\" to **C minor (v)**, the minor fifth chord.\n\nThis jump from F major to C minor (I -> v) is the song's signature harmonic move and happens at the very start of the vocal entry.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe song by The Beatles that starts with a chord jump from the tonic (I) to the minor fifth chord (v) is \"Michelle\".\n\n<<<Michelle>>>"
