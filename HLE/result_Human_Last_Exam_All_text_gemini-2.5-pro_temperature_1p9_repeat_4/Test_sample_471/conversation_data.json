    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the minimal number of critical points for a smooth function $f: T^2 \\to \\mathbb{R}$.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Preliminaries**\n\n*   **Torus ($T^2$):** The 2-torus is the surface of a donut. It is a compact, connected, orientable manifold. Its compactness is a key property.\n*   **Smooth Function:** A function $f: T^2 \\to \\mathbb{R}$ that is infinitely differentiable. We consider non-constant functions, as a constant function would have every point as a critical point.\n*   **Critical Point:** A point $p \\in T^2$ is a critical point of $f$ if the derivative (or gradient in local coordinates) of $f$ vanishes at $p$. These are points where the tangent plane is \"horizontal\" with respect to the function's value.\n\n**Step 2: Establish a Basic Lower Bound**\n\n*   By the **Extreme Value Theorem**, any continuous function on a compact space must attain a global maximum and a global minimum.\n*   The torus $T^2$ is a compact manifold.\n*   For a smooth function $f$, any point of local extremum (maximum or minimum) must be a critical point.\n*   Therefore, any non-constant smooth function $f: T^2 \\to \\mathbb{R}$ must have at least two critical points: a global maximum and a global minimum.\n*   This establishes that the minimal number of critical points is at least 2.\n\n**Step 3: Apply Morse Theory for a Stronger Lower Bound**\n\nMorse theory provides a deep connection between the number of critical points of a function and the topology of the underlying manifold. For this, we need the topological invariants of the torus.\n\n*   **Betti Numbers of the Torus:** The Betti numbers $b_k(M)$ of a manifold $M$ are the ranks of its homology groups, which intuitively count the number of $k$-dimensional \"holes\". For the 2-torus, $T^2$:\n    *   $b_0(T^2) = 1$ (it is one connected component).\n    *   $b_1(T^2) = 2$ (it has two independent non-bounding loops, or \"holes\": one along the longitude and one along the latitude).\n    *   $b_2(T^2) = 1$ (it encloses a 2-dimensional void, or cavity).\n*   **Euler Characteristic:** The Euler characteristic of $T^2$ is $\\chi(T^2) = b_0 - b_1 + b_2 = 1 - 2 + 1 = 0$.\n\n*   **Morse Inequalities:** For any Morse function $f$ on a compact manifold $M$ (a function with only non-degenerate critical points), the number of critical points of index $k$, denoted $c_k$, must satisfy the weak Morse inequalities:\n    $c_k \\ge b_k(M)$ for all $k=0, 1, 2, \\dots, \\dim(M)$.\n\n*   **Applying to the Torus:**\n    *   $c_0$ = number of local minima (index 0) $\\ge b_0(T^2) = 1$.\n    *   $c_1$ = number of saddle points (index 1) $\\ge b_1(T^2) = 2$.\n    *   $c_2$ = number of local maxima (index 2) $\\ge b_2(T^2) = 1$.\n\n*   **Total Number of Critical Points:** For a Morse function, the total number of critical points is $C = c_0 + c_1 + c_2$. Based on the inequalities, the minimum number is at least $1 + 2 + 1 = 4$.\n\n*   **Extension to All Smooth Functions:** The result from Morse theory gives a lower bound for *Morse functions*. However, Lusternik-Schnirelmann theory extends this result to *any* smooth function. A central theorem states that any smooth function on a compact manifold $M$ must have at least $\\text{cat}(M) + 1$ critical points, where $\\text{cat}(M)$ is the Lusternik-Schnirelmann category of $M$. For the torus, $\\text{cat}(T^2) = 3$. Therefore, any smooth function on $T^2$ must have at least $3 + 1 = 4$ critical points. Another way to see this is that any smooth function can be perturbed into a Morse function without creating new critical points (though it can split degenerate ones), so the bound holds generally.\n\nThis analysis establishes a lower bound: any smooth function on $T^2$ must have **at least 4** critical points.\n\n**Step 4: Construct a Function that Achieves the Lower Bound**\n\nTo show that 4 is the minimum, we must demonstrate that there exists a smooth function on the torus with exactly 4 critical points.\n\n1.  **Visualize the Torus:** Imagine a torus standing upright in 3D space. The standard \"height function\" $f(p) = z$ (the height of a point $p$ on the torus) has critical points where the tangent plane is horizontal. This occurs for the entire top circle (a maximum) and the entire bottom circle (a minimum). This function is not Morse because its critical points are degenerate (form continuous circles), and it has infinitely many of them.\n\n2.  **The \"Tilted\" Torus:** To get a finite number of critical points, we can \"tilt\" the torus slightly and again use the height function. This is equivalent to using a function like $g(x,y,z) = z + \\epsilon x$ on the standard torus for a small constant $\\epsilon > 0$. The critical points are still where the tangent plane is horizontal with respect to the value of $g$.\n    By tilting the torus, the single highest point and single lowest point from the original configuration are broken. The new function will have:\n    *   **One unique global maximum:** The point on the \"outer\" side that is highest.\n    *   **One unique global minimum:** The point on the \"outer\" side that is lowest.\n    *   **Two saddle points:** These occur on the \"inner\" part of the torus (the hole). One is a minimax point on the \"front\" inner side, and the other is a minimax point on the \"back\" inner side.\n\n3.  **Summary of Critical Points:** The tilted height function is a Morse function with exactly four critical points:\n    *   1 minimum (index 0)\n    *   2 saddles (index 1)\n    *   1 maximum (index 2)\n    The total is $1+2+1=4$. These numbers ($c_0=1, c_1=2, c_2=1$) perfectly match the lower bounds derived from the Betti numbers ($b_0=1, b_1=2, b_2=1$).\n\n**Final Conclusion**\n\nWe have established from topological principles (Morse theory or Lusternik-Schnirelmann theory) that any smooth function on the 2-torus must have at least 4 critical points. We have also constructed an explicit example of a smooth function (the height function on a slightly tilted torus) that has exactly 4 critical points. Therefore, the minimal number of critical points is 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
