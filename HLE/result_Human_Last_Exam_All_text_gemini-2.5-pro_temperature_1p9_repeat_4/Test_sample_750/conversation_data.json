    "Answering the question step-by-step:\n\n**1. Set up the equation**\n\nThe given equation is $z \\cdot i = i^z$ for $z \\in \\mathbb{C}$.\nLet $z = x + yi$, where $x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\n**2. Analyze the Left Hand Side (LHS)**\n\nLHS = $z \\cdot i = (x+yi)i = xi + yi^2 = -y + xi$.\nThe magnitude of the LHS is $|-y + xi| = \\sqrt{(-y)^2 + x^2} = \\sqrt{x^2+y^2} = |z|$.\nThe argument of the LHS is $\\arg(-y+xi)$.\n\n**3. Analyze the Right Hand Side (RHS)**\n\nThe term $i^z$ is a multi-valued complex power. It is defined as $i^z = e^{z \\log(i)}$.\nThe complex logarithm $\\log(i)$ is also multi-valued. The principal value is $\\text{Log}(i) = \\ln|i| + i\\arg(i) = \\ln(1) + i\\frac{\\pi}{2} = i\\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\nThe general form is $\\log(i) = i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)$ for any integer $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\nLet's denote $C_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi = (4k+1)\\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\n\nSo, RHS = $i^z = e^{z \\cdot i C_k} = e^{(x+yi)iC_k} = e^{xiC_k + y i^2 C_k} = e^{-yC_k + ixC_k}$.\nThis can be written in polar form as $e^{-yC_k} \\cdot e^{ixC_k}$.\nThe magnitude of the RHS is $|e^{-yC_k} \\cdot e^{ixC_k}| = e^{-yC_k}$.\nThe argument of the RHS is $x C_k$ (modulo $2\\pi$).\n\n**4. Equate the two sides**\n\nEquating the magnitudes and arguments (up to a multiple of $2\\pi$) of the LHS and RHS gives a system of equations.\n*   Magnitude equation: $|z| = e^{-yC_k} \\implies \\sqrt{x^2+y^2} = e^{-y(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)}$.\n*   Argument relation: The arguments must be equal modulo $2\\pi$. So $\\arg(-y+xi) = xC_k + 2m\\pi$ for some integer $m \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nAlternatively, we can equate the Cartesian forms:\n$-y + xi = e^{-yC_k} (\\cos(xC_k) + i\\sin(xC_k))$\nThis separates into two real equations:\n(A) $-y = e^{-yC_k} \\cos(xC_k)$\n(B) $x = e^{-yC_k} \\sin(xC_k)$\n\n**5. Solve the system of equations**\n\nWe look for solutions by considering different cases for $z$.\n\n**Case 1: Real solutions ($z=x$, so $y=0$)**\nSubstitute $y=0$ into equations (A) and (B):\n(A) $0 = e^0 \\cos(xC_k) \\implies \\cos(xC_k)=0$.\n(B) $x = e^0 \\sin(xC_k) \\implies x = \\sin(xC_k)$.\n\nFrom $\\cos(xC_k)=0$, the argument $xC_k$ must be an odd multiple of $\\pi/2$, i.e., $xC_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + n\\pi$ for some integer $n$.\nFor such an angle, $\\sin(xC_k) = \\pm 1$.\nSubstituting this into equation (B), we get $x = \\pm 1$.\n\n*   If $x=1$:\n    (A) $\\cos(C_k)=0$\n    (B) $1 = \\sin(C_k)$\n    These two conditions imply that $C_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2m\\pi$ for some integer $m$. Since $C_k=\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi$, this condition is satisfied by choosing $m=k$ for any integer $k$. Thus, $z=1$ is a solution.\n    Check: $1 \\cdot i = i$ and $i^1=i$. This is correct.\n\n*   If $x=-1$:\n    (A) $\\cos(-C_k)= \\cos(C_k)=0$\n    (B) $-1 = \\sin(-C_k) = -\\sin(C_k) \\implies \\sin(C_k)=1$\n    This is the same condition as for $x=1$. Thus, $z=-1$ is also a solution for any choice of branch $k$.\n    Check: $(-1) \\cdot i = -i$ and $i^{-1}=\\frac{1}{i}=-i$. This is correct.\n\n**Case 2: Purely imaginary solutions ($z=iy$, so $x=0$)**\nSubstitute $x=0$ into equations (A) and (B):\n(A) $-y = e^{-yC_k} \\cos(0) \\implies -y=e^{-yC_k}$.\n(B) $0 = e^{-yC_k} \\sin(0) \\implies 0=0$. This is always true and gives no information.\n\nWe need to solve the equation $-y=e^{-yC_k}$. Let's analyze it based on the sign of $C_k = (4k+1)\\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\n*   If $k \\ge 0$, then $C_k = (4k+1)\\frac{\\pi}{2} > 0$. The RHS $e^{-yC_k}$ is always positive. The equation $-y=e^{-yC_k}$ requires $-y > 0$, so $y<0$. Let $y=-a$ for $a>0$. The equation becomes $a = e^{aC_k}$. Since $a>0$ and $C_k \\ge \\pi/2 > 1$, we have $e^{aC_k} > e^a$. The equation $a=e^{aC_k}$ has no solution because for $a>0$, $e^{aC_k}$ grows much faster than $a$ and $e^{0 \\cdot C_k} = 1 > 0$. More formally, let $f(a) = e^{aC_k}-a$. Then $f'(a) = C_ke^{aC_k}-1 > 0$ for $a>0$, so $f(a)$ is strictly increasing. Since $f(0)=1$, $f(a)>1$ for all $a>0$. Thus there are no solutions for $k \\ge 0$.\n*   If $k \\le -1$, let $k=-j$ for $j \\in \\{1, 2, 3, \\dots\\}$. Then $C_k = (1-4j)\\frac{\\pi}{2} = - (4j-1)\\frac{\\pi}{2}$. Let's call $D_j = (4j-1)\\frac{\\pi}{2} > 0$. The equation becomes $-y=e^{yD_j}$. The RHS is always positive, so we must have $y<0$. Let $y=-a$ for $a>0$. The equation becomes $a = e^{-aD_j}$.\n    Let's analyze $f(a)=a$ and $g(a)=e^{-aD_j}$. At $a=0$, $f(0)=0$ and $g(0)=1$. As $a\\to\\infty$, $f(a)\\to\\infty$ and $g(a)\\to 0$. Since $f$ is increasing and $g$ is decreasing, there must be exactly one positive solution $a_j$ for each $j \\ge 1$.\n    These solutions can be expressed using the Lambert W function. From $a=e^{-aD_j}$, we get $aD_j e^{aD_j} = D_j$. This gives $aD_j = W(D_j)$, so $a_j = \\frac{W(D_j)}{D_j} = \\frac{W((4j-1)\\frac{\\pi}{2})}{(4j-1)\\frac{\\pi}{2}}$.\n    So, for each integer $j \\ge 1$, there is a unique purely imaginary solution $z = iy = -ia_j$. This gives an infinite sequence of purely imaginary solutions.\n\n**Case 3: General complex solutions ($z=x+iy$ with $x \\ne 0, y \\ne 0$)**\n\nA full analysis reveals that there is a doubly infinite set of complex solutions. The complete set of solutions to the equation $z \\cdot i=i^z$ can be described using the Lambert W function. The derivation shows that solutions are of the form\n$z_{k,n} = i\\frac{W_n(-C_k)}{C_k} = i\\frac{W_n(-(\\frac{\\pi}{2}+2k\\pi))}{\\frac{\\pi}{2}+2k\\pi}$, where $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ specifies the branch of the complex logarithm and $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ specifies the branch of the Lambert W function, $W_n$.\nThe real and purely imaginary solutions found above are special cases of this general formula.\nFor example, for $k \\le -1$, the principal branch $n=0$ gives the purely imaginary solutions we found. The real solutions $z=\\pm 1$ are also recovered for specific choices of $k$ and $n$. The other choices of $(k,n)$ give complex solutions with non-zero real and imaginary parts.\n\n**Summary of Solutions**\n\n1.  **Real solutions**: $z=1$ and $z=-1$.\n2.  **Purely imaginary solutions**: There is an infinite sequence of solutions $z_j = -ia_j$ for $j=1, 2, 3, \\dots$, where $a_j$ is the unique positive real number that solves the equation $a = e^{-a(4j-1)\\pi/2}$.\n3.  **Other complex solutions**: All other solutions are complex with non-zero real and imaginary parts. They can be fully characterized by the Lambert W function formula mentioned above.\n\n<<<The solutions for $z$ are:\n1. Two real solutions: $z=1$ and $z=-1$.\n2. An infinite sequence of purely imaginary solutions $z_j = -ia_j$ for each positive integer $j=1, 2, 3, \\ldots$, where $a_j$ is the unique positive real solution to the equation $a = e^{-a(4j-1)\\pi/2}$. In terms of the principal branch of the Lambert W function, $a_j = \\frac{W((4j-1)\\frac{\\pi}{2})}{(4j-1)\\frac{\\pi}{2}}$.\n3. A doubly-infinite set of other non-real complex solutions, given by $z_{k,n} = i\\frac{W_n(-(\\frac{\\pi}{2}+2k\\pi))}{\\frac{\\pi}{2}+2k\\pi}$ for integers $k$ and $n$, excluding the cases that produce the real or purely imaginary solutions listed above.>>>"
