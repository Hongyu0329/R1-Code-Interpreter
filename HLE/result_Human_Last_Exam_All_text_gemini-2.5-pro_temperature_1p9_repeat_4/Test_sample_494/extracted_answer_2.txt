Yes, the exotic ammonia molecule would still exhibit tunneling. The potential energy function governing the inversion is unchanged, so the nitrogen atom can still tunnel. While the Pauli principle for spin-0 bosons would alter the populations of the rotational states compared to normal ammonia, it would not forbid the existence of the tunneling-split energy level doublets for the allowed rotational states. The energy splitting would still be present and observable.
