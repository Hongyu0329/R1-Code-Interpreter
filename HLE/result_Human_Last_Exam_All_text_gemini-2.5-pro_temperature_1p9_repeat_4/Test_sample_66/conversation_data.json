    "The user wants me to find the maximum possible rank of a matrix representing the flag of Tonga.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Flag of Tonga:**\n    The flag of Tonga consists of a red field (background) with a white canton (a rectangle in the upper-left corner). Inside this white canton, there is a red couped cross (a cross that does not extend to the edges of the canton).\n\n2.  **Model the Flag as a Matrix (M):**\n    We assign a numerical value `a` to every red pixel and `b` to every white pixel. The resulting matrix `M` will have its entries drawn from the set `{a, b}`. To maximize the rank, we should assume `a` and `b` are distinct, i.e., `a ≠ b`. We should also assume `a ≠ 0` and `b ≠ 0` to avoid trivial cases, although the final result will be robust.\n\n3.  **Express the Matrix `M` in a structured form:**\n    Let `J` be a matrix of the same dimensions as `M` where every entry is 1.\n    Let `K` be a matrix of the same dimensions as `M` which acts as an indicator matrix for the white pixels. `K_ij = 1` if the pixel `(i,j)` is white, and `K_ij = 0` if it is red.\n    The matrix `M` can be expressed as a linear combination of `J` and `K`.\n    A red pixel has value `a`. In the `K` matrix, this is a 0.\n    A white pixel has value `b`. In the `K` matrix, this is a 1.\n    We can write `M_ij = a * (1 - K_ij) + b * K_ij = a*1 - a*K_ij + b*K_ij = a + (b-a)K_ij`.\n    So, `M = aJ + (b-a)K`.\n\n4.  **Relate the Rank of `M` to the Rank of `K`:**\n    The column space of `M` is contained within the sum of the column spaces of `aJ` and `(b-a)K`.\n    `Col(M) ⊆ Col(aJ) + Col((b-a)K)`.\n    Assuming `a ≠ 0` and `b-a ≠ 0`, `Col(aJ)` is the space spanned by the all-ones vector `j`, and `Col((b-a)K)` is simply `Col(K)`.\n    So, `Col(M) ⊆ span(Col(K) ∪ {j})`.\n    This gives an inequality for the rank: `rank(M) ≤ rank(K) + 1`.\n    The question becomes what is the maximum possible rank of `K`. The rank of `M` can be at most `rank(K) + 1`. The maximal possible rank of `M` would be `max(rank(K)) + 1`, provided we can show this is achievable.\n\n5.  **Analyze the structure of matrix `K`:**\n    The matrix `K` has entries of 1 only where the flag is white. This happens only in the canton, and specifically in the area of the canton not covered by the red cross.\n    *   Let the full image have dimensions `N x P`.\n    *   Let the canton be in the top-left `m x n` block.\n    *   The matrix `K` will have non-zero entries only in this `m x n` top-left block. Let's call this block `K_w`. So `K` is a block matrix of the form `[[K_w, 0], [0, 0]]`.\n    *   Therefore, `rank(K) = rank(K_w)`. We need to maximize `rank(K_w)`.\n    *   `K_w` represents the white part of the canton. It's a white rectangle with a red cross punched out of it.\n    *   `K_w` can be modeled as `J_c - K_cross`, where `J_c` is an `m x n` matrix of all ones (representing the white rectangle background of the canton) and `K_cross` is the indicator matrix for the red cross.\n\n6.  **Analyze the structure of the cross matrix `K_cross`:**\n    The red cross is formed by the union of a horizontal rectangle (the horizontal bar) and a vertical rectangle (the vertical bar).\n    *   Let `H` be the indicator matrix for the horizontal bar. `H` is a block of ones, so `rank(H) = 1`.\n    *   Let `V` be the indicator matrix for the vertical bar. `V` is a block of ones, so `rank(V) = 1`.\n    *   Let `I` be the indicator matrix for their intersection. `I` is also a block of ones, so `rank(I) = 1`.\n    *   Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, `K_cross = H + V - I`.\n    *   Now substitute this back into the expression for `K_w`: `K_w = J_c - (H + V - I) = J_c - H - V + I`.\n    *   `K_w` is a sum of four matrices, each of which has a rank of 1 (`J_c`, `H`, `V`, `I`).\n    *   The rank of a sum of matrices is at most the sum of their ranks. Therefore, `rank(K_w) ≤ rank(J_c) + rank(H) + rank(V) + rank(I) = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4`.\n    *   So, the maximum possible rank of `K_w` (and thus `K`) is 4.\n\n7.  **Construct an example where `rank(K_w) = 4`:**\n    To achieve rank 4, we can choose the pixel resolution of the canton to be at least `4x4`. Let's define the geometry of the cross within a `4x4` canton.\n    *   Let the horizontal bar cover rows `I_H = {1, 2}` and columns `J_H = {1, 2}`.\n    *   Let the vertical bar cover rows `I_V = {2, 3}` and columns `J_V = {2, 3}`.\n    *   The cross (`K_cross`) would have 1s where `(i,j)` is in `(I_H x J_H) U (I_V x J_V)`. This results in `K_cross = [[1,1,0,0],[1,1,1,0],[0,1,1,0],[0,0,0,0]]`.\n    *   Then `K_w = J_c - K_cross` would be `K_w = [[0,0,1,1],[0,0,0,1],[1,0,0,1],[1,1,1,1]]`.\n    *   By performing Gaussian elimination or calculating the determinant of this `K_w` matrix, we can find its rank.\n        `det(K_w) = 0 - 0 + 1 * det([[0,0,1],[1,0,1],[1,1,1]]) - 1 * det([[0,0,0],[1,0,0],[1,1,1]])`\n        `det(K_w) = 1 * (1 * det([[0,1],[0,1]])) - 0 = 0`. This example has rank < 4.\n\n    Let's use the vector representation from the thought process which yielded a rank 4 matrix.\n    `H = (e_1+e_2)(e_1+e_2)^T`, `V = (e_2+e_3)(e_2+e_3)^T`, `I = e_2 e_2^T`.\n    `K_cross = H+V-I = [[1,1,0,0],[1,1,1,0],[0,1,1,0],[0,0,0,0]]`.\n    Then `K_w = J_c - K_cross = [[0,0,1,1],[0,0,0,1],[1,0,0,1],[1,1,1,1]]`. Let me re-check its rank.\n    `r3 -> r3-r4`: `[0,-1,-1,0]`\n    `r1, r2, r3', r4` is `[[0,0,1,1], [0,0,0,1], [0,-1,-1,0], [1,1,1,1]]`.\n    Swapping rows gives `[[1,1,1,1],[0,-1,-1,0],[0,0,1,1],[0,0,0,1]]`.\n    This matrix is upper triangular with a non-zero diagonal. It is invertible and has rank 4.\n    So, it is possible to construct a `K_w` with `rank(K_w) = 4`. This implies `max rank(K) = 4`.\n\n8.  **Determine the Final Maximum Rank of `M`:**\n    We found `max rank(K) = 4` and `rank(M) ≤ rank(K) + 1`. This means `max rank(M) ≤ 5`.\n    Can we achieve rank 5? This happens if `rank(M) = rank(K) + 1`.\n    The column space of `M` is `span(j, Col(K))`. The rank of `M` is `rank(K) + 1` if and only if the all-ones vector `j` is not in the column space of `K`.\n    The matrix `K` has its non-zero entries confined to the top-left `m x n` block (the canton). Any vector in `Col(K)` will have zeros for all components corresponding to rows below the canton (i.e., rows `i > m`).\n    The all-ones vector `j` has non-zero entries (ones) everywhere. Therefore, `j` cannot be in `Col(K)`.\n    This confirms that `rank(M) = rank(K) + 1` (assuming `a` and `b-a` are non-zero).\n    Since the maximum possible rank for `K` is 4, the maximum possible rank for `M` is `4 + 1 = 5`."
