The most common reason is that modern MRI coils incorporate active detuning circuits, typically using PIN diodes. These circuits are designed to protect the sensitive receive coil and its preamplifier from the high-power RF transmit pulse by intentionally making the coil non-resonant. For safety, many coils are designed so that this "detuned" state is their default when they are unpowered. When you test the coil on a bench with a VNA, it is unpowered and thus remains in its non-resonant, detuned state. It only becomes resonant when plugged into the MRI scanner, which provides the necessary DC bias to switch the PIN diodes into their "receive" mode. Therefore, the coil is fully functional within its intended system but appears non-resonant during a simple, unpowered bench test.
