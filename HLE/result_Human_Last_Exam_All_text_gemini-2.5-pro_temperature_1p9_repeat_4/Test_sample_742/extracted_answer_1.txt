No. It is not possible. Gödel's ontological proof is a formal argument in modal logic, based on a specific set of axioms concerning abstract properties. The mathematical framework of quantum mechanics (using Hilbert spaces, operators, etc.) is a physical theory designed to model the behavior of matter and energy. The concepts, axioms, and language of Gödel's proof (e.g., "positive property," "necessary existence") have no natural or defined counterparts in the mathematical language of quantum mechanics. The two domains are conceptually and methodologically distinct.
