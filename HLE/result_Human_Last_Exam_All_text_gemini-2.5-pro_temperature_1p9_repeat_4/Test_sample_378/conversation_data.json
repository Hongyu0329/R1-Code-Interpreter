    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Identify the core assertion in the question.**\nThe question asks for the specific year that a person, Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan, publicly identified himself as \"Azikiwe.\" This presumes that such an event actually occurred.\n\n**Step 2: Verify the full name of the individual in question.**\nThe individual is Goodluck Jonathan, the former President of Nigeria. A review of all official records, biographies, and reputable news sources confirms his full name is **Goodluck Ebele Jonathan**. The name \"Azikiwe\" is not part of his legal or commonly used name.\n\n**Step 3: Investigate any potential connection to the name \"Azikiwe.\"**\nThe name \"Azikiwe\" is famously associated with another major figure in Nigerian history: **Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe**, who was the first President of Nigeria (1963â€“1966). There is no known familial or political affiliation that would lead Goodluck Jonathan to adopt \"Azikiwe\" as part of his own name. The two are distinct historical figures.\n\n**Step 4: Search for any public declarations, name changes, or statements.**\nA thorough search of news archives, official government publications from his time in office (as Deputy Governor, Governor, Vice President, and President), and public speeches reveals no instance where Goodluck Ebele Jonathan ever publicly identified himself by adding \"Azikiwe\" to his name or replacing one of his names with it.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude based on the evidence.**\nThe premise of the question is incorrect. Goodluck Ebele Jonathan has never publicly identified himself as \"Azikiwe.\" Therefore, it is impossible to provide a year for an event that did not happen.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Distinction of Persons:** It is crucial not to confuse Goodluck Ebele Jonathan with Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe. They are different people from different eras of Nigerian politics.\n2.  **Accuracy of Names:** Public figures' names are a matter of public record. Any change would be a significant and documented event, which is absent in this case.\n3.  **Nature of \"Public Identification\":** This would imply a formal announcement, a legal name change, or consistent usage in official settings. None of these have occurred.\n4.  **Source of the Misinformation:** The query likely stems from a misunderstanding or the circulation of incorrect information, possibly by confusing the two presidents.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nBased on a detailed analysis of all available public records and historical facts, there is no evidence that Goodluck Ebele Jonathan ever publicly identified himself as \"Azikiwe.\" The name is not part of his official name, and he never adopted it.\n\n<<<There is no record of Goodluck Ebele Jonathan ever publicly identifying himself as Azikiwe. This event never occurred.>>>"
