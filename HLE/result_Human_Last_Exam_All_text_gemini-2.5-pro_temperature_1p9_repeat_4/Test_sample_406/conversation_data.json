    "This problem asks for the conditions that guarantee the existence of a special kind of fixed point, called an FGH-tripled fixed point, for a system of three functions `F`, `G`, and `H`. We will derive these conditions by applying the well-known Banach Fixed Point Theorem to a suitable operator defined on a product of metric spaces.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Define the Problem Precisely**\n\nFirst, we need to formalize the objects involved.\n\n*   **Spaces:** Let `(X, d_X)`, `(Y, d_Y)`, and `(Z, d_Z)` be three metric spaces.\n*   **Functions:** We are given three functions with specific domains and codomains:\n    *   `F: X × Y × Z → X`\n    *   `G: Y × X × Y → Y`\n    *   `H: Z × Y × X → Z`\n    (Note: The question listed `G` twice; we assume the third function is `H` for the term \"FGH-tripled fixed point\" to be meaningful).\n*   **FGH-Tripled Fixed Point:** An **FGH-tripled fixed point** is a triplet of points `(x, y, z)` where `x ∈ X`, `y ∈ Y`, and `z ∈ Z`, that simultaneously satisfies the following system of equations:\n    1.  `F(x, y, z) = x`\n    2.  `G(y, x, y) = y`\n    3.  `H(z, y, x) = z`\n\n**Step 2: Identify Key Concepts and Careful Points**\n\nTo prove the existence of such a point, we use the Banach Fixed Point Theorem. This requires two main components: a complete metric space and a contraction mapping on that space.\n\n1.  **Define a Unified Space:** We combine the three spaces into a single product space `W = X × Y × Z`.\n2.  **Define a Metric on the Product Space:** We need a metric `d_W` on `W`. A standard and convenient choice is the sum metric (or `L₁` metric):\n    `d_W((x₁, y₁, z₁), (x₂, y₂, z₂)) = d_X(x₁, x₂) + d_Y(y₁, y₂) + d_Z(z₁, z₂)`\n3.  **Requirement of Completeness:** The Banach theorem requires the space to be complete. The product space `(W, d_W)` is a complete metric space if and only if each component space `(X, d_X)`, `(Y, d_Y)`, and `(Z, d_Z)` is complete. This gives us our first crucial condition.\n4.  **Define a Unified Operator:** The system of three equations can be expressed as a single fixed-point equation `T(w) = w` for an operator `T: W → W`. We define `w = (x, y, z)` and `T` as follows:\n    `T(x, y, z) = (F(x, y, z), G(y, x, y), H(z, y, x))`\n    An FGH-tripled fixed point is exactly a fixed point of this operator `T`.\n\n**Step 3: Derive the Contraction Condition**\n\nThe final step is to find the conditions on `F`, `G`, and `H` that make `T` a contraction mapping. `T` is a contraction if there exists a constant `k ∈ [0, 1)` such that for any two points `w₁ = (x₁, y₁, z₁)` and `w₂ = (x₂, y₂, z₂)` in `W`, the following inequality holds:\n`d_W(T(w₁), T(w₂)) ≤ k * d_W(w₁, w₂)`\n\nLet's expand the left side using the definitions of `d_W` and `T`:\n`d_W(T(w₁), T(w₂)) = d_X(F(x₁,y₁,z₁), F(x₂,y₂,z₂)) + d_Y(G(y₁,x₁,y₁), G(y₂,x₂,y₂)) + d_Z(H(z₁,y₁,x₁), H(z₂,y₂,x₂))`\n\nTo make this inequality tractable, we assume `F`, `G`, and `H` are Lipschitz-continuous with respect to their variables. That is, there exist non-negative constants such that:\n*   `d_X(F(x₁,y₁,z₁), F(x₂,y₂,z₂)) ≤ α₁ d_X(x₁,x₂) + β₁ d_Y(y₁,y₂) + γ₁ d_Z(z₁,z₂)`\n*   `d_Y(G(y₁,x₁,y₁), G(y₂,x₂,y₂)) ≤ α₂ d_X(x₁,x₂) + β₂ d_Y(y₁,y₂)`\n*   `d_Z(H(z₁,y₁,x₁), H(z₂,y₂,x₂)) ≤ α₃ d_X(x₁,x₂) + β₃ d_Y(y₁,y₂) + γ₃ d_Z(z₁,z₂)`\n\nSubstituting these inequalities into the expression for `d_W(T(w₁), T(w₂))`, we get:\n`d_W(T(w₁), T(w₂)) ≤ (α₁ d_X + β₁ d_Y + γ₁ d_Z) + (α₂ d_X + β₂ d_Y) + (α₃ d_X + β₃ d_Y + γ₃ d_Z)`\n\nNow, we group the terms by the component metrics `d_X`, `d_Y`, and `d_Z`:\n`d_W(T(w₁), T(w₂)) ≤ (α₁ + α₂ + α₃)d_X(x₁,x₂) + (β₁ + β₂ + β₃)d_Y(y₁,y₂) + (γ₁ + γ₃)d_Z(z₁,z₂)`\n\nLet `K_x = α₁+α₂+α₃`, `K_y = β₁+β₂+β₃`, and `K_z = γ₁+γ₃`. The inequality becomes:\n`d_W(T(w₁), T(w₂)) ≤ K_x d_X(x₁,x₂) + K_y d_Y(y₁,y₂) + K_z d_Z(z₁,z₂)`\n\nIf we let `k = max(K_x, K_y, K_z)`, then we can write:\n`d_W(T(w₁), T(w₂)) ≤ k d_X(x₁,x₂) + k d_Y(y₁,y₂) + k d_Z(z₁,z₂) = k (d_X + d_Y + d_Z) = k * d_W(w₁, w₂)`\n\nFor `T` to be a contraction, we need `k < 1`. This leads to our final condition.\n\n### Final Answer: Conditions for Existence and Uniqueness\n\nBased on the analysis, a set of sufficient conditions for the existence of a unique FGH-tripled fixed point is given by the Banach Fixed Point Theorem.\n\n<<<An FGH-tripled fixed point `(x, y, z) ∈ X × Y × Z` exists and is unique if the following conditions hold:\n\n**1. Space Requirement:**\nThe spaces `(X, d_X)`, `(Y, d_Y)`, and `(Z, d_Z)` must be **complete metric spaces**.\n\n**2. Contraction Requirement:**\nThe functions `F`, `G`, and `H` must satisfy a joint contraction condition. Specifically, there must exist a set of non-negative constants `{α₁, β₁, γ₁, α₂, β₂, α₃, β₃, γ₃}` such that for all `x₁, x₂ ∈ X`, `y₁, y₂ ∈ Y`, and `z₁, z₂ ∈ Z`, the following inequalities are satisfied:\n  *   `d_X(F(x₁, y₁, z₁), F(x₂, y₂, z₂)) ≤ α₁ d_X(x₁, x₂) + β₁ d_Y(y₁, y₂) + γ₁ d_Z(z₁, z₂)`\n  *   `d_Y(G(y₁, x₁, y₁), G(y₂, x₂, y₂)) ≤ α₂ d_X(x₁, x₂) + β₂ d_Y(y₁, y₂)`\n  *   `d_Z(H(z₁, y₁, x₁), H(z₂, y₂, x₂)) ≤ α₃ d_X(x₁, x₂) + β₃ d_Y(y₁, y₂) + γ₃ d_Z(z₁, z₂)`\n\nFurthermore, the sum of these constants, when grouped by the corresponding component of the product space, must be less than 1. That is:\n  `max(α₁ + α₂ + α₃,  β₁ + β₂ + β₃,  γ₁ + γ₃) < 1`>>>"
