    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of ways to place 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard.\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Board and Constraints**\n\n*   **Board:** A 5x5 grid where the edges wrap around. We can represent the squares by coordinates `(x, y)` where `x, y` are integers from 0 to 4 (`Z_5 x Z_5`). All calculations are performed modulo 5.\n*   **Toroidal Attack:** A queen at `(x, y)` attacks any square `(x', y')` if it lies on the same row, column, or diagonal. On a toroidal board, this means:\n    1.  `x' = x` (same row)\n    2.  `y' = y` (same column)\n    3.  `x' - y' = x - y (mod 5)` (same main diagonal)\n    4.  `x' + y' = x + y (mod 5)` (same anti-diagonal)\n*   **Problem:** We need to find the number of sets of 4 squares `{(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), (x_3, y_3), (x_4, y_4)}` such that no two squares attack each other. This is equivalent to requiring that:\n    1.  The four x-coordinates `{x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4}` are all distinct.\n    2.  The four y-coordinates `{y_1, y_2, y_3, y_4}` are all distinct.\n    3.  The four main diagonal indices `{x_1-y_1, x_2-y_2, x_3-y_3, x_4-y_4}` (mod 5) are all distinct.\n    4.  The four anti-diagonal indices `{x_1+y_1, x_2+y_2, x_3+y_3, x_4+y_4}` (mod 5) are all distinct.\n\n**Step 2: Using Symmetry to Simplify the Problem**\n\nThe toroidal board has a high degree of symmetry. Specifically, it is symmetric under translation. If we have a valid arrangement of 4 queens, translating the entire arrangement by a vector `(c, d)` will result in another valid arrangement.\n\nThis means we can simplify the problem by first finding all solutions that include a queen at a specific position, say `(0,0)`. Then, we can generate all other solutions by translation.\n\nLet one queen be at `Q1 = (0,0)`. Now we need to place three other queens, `Q2, Q3, Q4` at `(x_i, y_i)` for `i=2,3,4`. The constraints for these three points are:\n1.  `x_i` must be in `{1, 2, 3, 4}`.\n2.  `y_i` must be in `{1, 2, 3, 4}`.\n3.  `x_i - y_i (mod 5)` must be in `{1, 2, 3, 4}` (since `Q1` covers diagonal 0). This means `x_i ≠ y_i`.\n4.  `x_i + y_i (mod 5)` must be in `{1, 2, 3, 4}` (since `Q1` covers anti-diagonal 0). This means `x_i ≠ -y_i (mod 5)`.\n\nCombining these, any other queen must be on a square `(x,y)` where `x,y \\in \\{1,2,3,4\\}` and `y \\ne x` and `y \\ne 5-x`. Let's list the possible squares:\n*   If x=1, y can't be 1 or 4. Possible squares: `(1,2), (1,3)`.\n*   If x=2, y can't be 2 or 3. Possible squares: `(2,1), (2,4)`.\n*   If x=3, y can't be 3 or 2. Possible squares: `(3,1), (3,4)`.\n*   If x=4, y can't be 4 or 1. Possible squares: `(4,2), (4,3)`.\n\nThis gives a set `S` of 8 possible squares for the remaining three queens. We must choose 3 squares from this set `S` that are mutually non-attacking.\n\n**Step 3: Finding all Solutions Containing (0,0)**\n\nA systematic search for sets of 3 non-attacking points from the 8-element set `S` reveals a surprising pattern: every valid solution containing the point `(0,0)` is part of a \"linear\" progression. A careful exhaustive check (as sketched in the thoughts) shows that all such solutions fall into one of two categories:\n\n*   The 4 queens lie on a line of the form `y = 2x (mod 5)`.\n*   The 4 queens lie on a line of the form `y = 3x (mod 5)`.\n\nFor example, the set `{(0,0), (1,2), (2,4), (3,1)}` is a valid solution. All its points satisfy `y=2x`. The `x`-coordinates are `{0,1,2,3}`. This set corresponds to one of the solutions containing `(0,0)`.\n\n**Step 4: Classifying and Counting All Solutions**\n\nFrom the conclusion of Step 3, we can infer that **all** valid 4-queen arrangements on the 5x5 toroidal board must be of the \"linear\" form:\n`y = mx + c (mod 5)` for some slope `m` and intercept `c`.\n(Arrangements of the form `x = my + c` are equivalent to `y = m⁻¹x - m⁻¹c`, so we only need to consider one form).\n\nLet's check the constraints on the line `y = mx+c`:\n1.  **Distinct `x`:** We place queens on 4 chosen `x` coordinates (rows).\n2.  **Distinct `y`:** The `y` coordinates `y_i = mx_i + c` will be distinct if `m \\ne 0`. So `m \\in \\{1,2,3,4\\}`.\n3.  **Distinct `x-y`:** The diagonal indices are `x_i - y_i = x_i - (mx_i + c) = (1-m)x_i - c`. These will be distinct if `1-m \\ne 0`, which means `m \\ne 1`.\n4.  **Distinct `x+y`:** The anti-diagonal indices are `x_i + y_i = x_i + (mx_i + c) = (1+m)x_i + c`. These will be distinct if `1+m \\ne 0`, which means `m \\ne -1 \\equiv 4 (mod 5)`.\n\nSo, the slope `m` can only be **2** or **3**.\n\nNow we can count the total number of unique arrangements by choosing the parameters that define them:\n1.  **Choose the slope `m`:** 2 choices (`m=2` or `m=3`).\n2.  **Choose the intercept `c`:** 5 choices (`c` from 0 to 4).\n3.  **Choose the 4 `x`-coordinates (rows):** We need to choose 4 distinct rows out of 5 available rows. This can be done in `C(5, 4) = 5` ways.\n\nThe total number of ways seems to be the product of these choices. We need to verify that each unique triplet `(m, c, R)` where `R` is the set of 4 rows, defines a unique set of 4 queen positions.\nA configuration is defined by the set of points `{(x, mx+c) | x in R}`.\nIf `(m, c, R) = (m', c', R')`, the configurations are obviously the same.\nIf `(m, c, R) ≠ (m', c', R')`, are the configurations different?\n*   If `m ≠ m'`, the configurations must be different (they are from different \"families\" of solutions).\n*   If `m=m'` but `R ≠ R'`, the set of x-coordinates for the queens is different, so the configurations are different.\n*   If `m=m'` and `R=R'`, but `c ≠ c'`, the y-coordinates are different (`y = mx+c` vs `y=mx+c'`), so the configurations are different.\n\nTherefore, each unique choice of `(m, c, R)` yields a distinct arrangement.\n\n**Step 5: Final Calculation**\n\nTotal ways = (choices for slope `m`) * (choices for intercept `c`) * (choices for rows `R`)\nTotal ways = 2 * 5 * C(5, 4)\nTotal ways = 2 * 5 * 5\nTotal ways = 50\n\nThere are 50 distinct ways to place 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard.\n\n<<<50>>>"
